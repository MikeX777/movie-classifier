00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,443
PROLOGUE
followed by

2
00:00:28,634 --> 00:00:30,474
TRAP

3
00:00:58,424 --> 00:01:07,357
TRAP

4
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:11,351
Vermin

5
00:01:48,978 --> 00:01:52,888
I'd like to ask you something.
It's quite difficult.

6
00:01:54,801 --> 00:01:56,928
What have you got of...

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,992
Really dangerous traps?
The most dangerous you have.

8
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:05,179
We have all kinds of things here.
Why d'you want? For...

9
00:02:05,524 --> 00:02:08,326
For the devil?
For animals? For...

10
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:11,546
For large animals, yes,
but not that either.

11
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:14,948
For really big animals,
you've something?

12
00:02:15,141 --> 00:02:19,420
I don't know what you mean
by 'really big'. If...

13
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,117
This trap is a mousetrap
in all its innocence.

14
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:28,084
You could perhaps build
a bigger trap on the same model.

15
00:02:28,305 --> 00:02:31,449
We have a little bigger.
A trap for the imagination.

16
00:02:32,221 --> 00:02:34,584
The DEVIL'S GRAIN
for the destruction of RATS

17
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:37,194
- The Egg Trap.
- Yes.

18
00:02:38,175 --> 00:02:39,238
Paul.

19
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:44,404
We must meet someone
who likes eggs too,

20
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:48,219
to take someone with an egg trap.

21
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:51,273
No, no, no.
Someone who hates eggs.

22
00:02:52,168 --> 00:02:54,506
For when we give it a good kick.

23
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:57,669
- Ah, yes.
- You see.

24
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,614
In all innocence.

25
00:03:00,705 --> 00:03:02,392
There.

26
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,225
Now, you please.

27
00:03:06,183 --> 00:03:08,065
We must hit the egg?

28
00:03:09,136 --> 00:03:10,516
Yes...

29
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:13,533
- But it's still small.
- You want something dangerous.

30
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:17,311
- The most dangerous you have.
- The most dangerous, I said, it's...

31
00:03:17,504 --> 00:03:20,189
For flies. Flies are the devil.
It's, very dangerous.

32
00:03:20,382 --> 00:03:23,955
I advise you rarely...
Really, you are someone special.

33
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,394
There's this.

34
00:03:25,554 --> 00:03:28,710
- It wouldn't hurt a fly.
- Or even a tiger trap.

35
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:33,491
With this you could...

36
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:35,883
Hunt for everything.

37
00:03:36,246 --> 00:03:38,070
A tiger trap.

38
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:42,683
The way to set it
isn't complicated, you see.

39
00:03:42,803 --> 00:03:44,561
But, you still have to be very careful.

40
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:47,261
Because it's still
a very dangerous trap.

41
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,016
It could completely crush a bone?

42
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:53,218
Ah! Yes. Pulverize a bone
completely, no problem.

43
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,323
- It can cut a leg?
- Yes, yes.

44
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:58,389
If you want for tigers and lions..

45
00:03:58,846 --> 00:04:00,151
As bait...

46
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:02,223
You can put a cow.

47
00:04:02,433 --> 00:04:04,531
You hang a cow from a pole

48
00:04:05,007 --> 00:04:07,048
Should I have a cow at my disposal.

49
00:04:10,237 --> 00:04:11,511
There!

50
00:04:13,119 --> 00:04:16,167
There you have to be
very careful because, there...

51
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:20,133
- I remove the safety catch.
- Yes.

52
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:21,838
And now...

53
00:04:22,238 --> 00:04:26,067
If you can back off a little bit
because it is very, very dangerous

54
00:04:26,487 --> 00:04:29,088
- And remove your foot too.
- Yes.

55
00:04:32,144 --> 00:04:34,143
- It's not broken?
- No.

56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,207
The bone is broken forever.
In the beast the nerves will remain...

57
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,725
- Yes.
- Which are there.

58
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:45,368
This is what holds the beast,
holds...

59
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:46,934
The animal.

60
00:04:47,438 --> 00:04:49,108
The animal, if you want.

61
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,262
I'll take it.

62
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:57,338
You're afraid of being robbed?

63
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,585
It's difficult to answer...

64
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:03,190
Yes.

65
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:05,005
To be stolen, but...

66
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:09,092
Stolen... But what can be stolen?

67
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:12,476
Things.

68
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:17,805
Not material things anyway.

69
00:05:18,884 --> 00:05:20,759
Not necessarily.

70
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:26,261
So if it's not material things,
then it's spiritual things.

71
00:05:28,778 --> 00:05:29,974
Perhaps, perhaps.

72
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:37,134
Because you'll have noticed,
here we have all kinds of traps.

73
00:05:38,309 --> 00:05:40,323
But we don't have...

74
00:05:40,462 --> 00:05:42,123
Hog traps.

75
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:46,543
- Right.
- Is...

76
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:50,515
I'm afraid there isn't...

77
00:05:51,095 --> 00:05:54,044
something... pig like

78
00:05:54,508 --> 00:05:57,193
in this fear of theft.

79
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:01,102
Are you a virgin?

80
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:03,600
No.

81
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,071
Why that question?

82
00:06:05,474 --> 00:06:07,236
What sign are you then?

83
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:09,443
- Taurus.
- Taurus.

84
00:06:10,355 --> 00:06:12,741
We're in a world of animals.

85
00:06:16,236 --> 00:06:19,341
I think that...
in the world of animals

86
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:22,017
anything is possible.

87
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,884
So I think that
when you are afraid of stealing,

88
00:06:27,247 --> 00:06:29,345
of being stolen,
it's the same thing.

89
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:34,162
It's that you want
to become an animal.

90
00:06:36,998 --> 00:06:38,397
D'you think?

91
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:41,613
I'm looking to see which animal.

92
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:49,509
Because if there are men
who come to attack you...

93
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:52,085
These men...

94
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:55,204
against whom you defend yourself,

95
00:06:56,564 --> 00:07:00,049
For as long as you defend yourself,
they will attack you.

96
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,156
You will be attacked.

97
00:07:02,715 --> 00:07:05,174
And I see, you will be attacked.

98
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:07,205
With a straw.

99
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:10,365
Make a hole in your head.
And then drink.

100
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:15,848
They will absorb...
your thoughts, your dreams.

101
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,900
You're afraid of that?

102
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:25,786
And as you're afraid someone
will steal your spiritual force,

103
00:07:26,977 --> 00:07:28,880
you protect yourself.

104
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,471
And you protect yourself
against animal forces.

105
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:37,661
What you call in your language,
a very mediocre language,

106
00:07:39,694 --> 00:07:40,393
Thieves.

107
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:43,007
They don't exist, thieves.
Property doesn't exist.

108
00:07:43,617 --> 00:07:46,852
From the last century, we know
that property, and theft too,

109
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,289
So society...

110
00:07:48,429 --> 00:07:52,485
Property doesn't exist.
So you protect yourself from what?

111
00:07:53,268 --> 00:07:55,114
If I might ask?

112
00:07:58,705 --> 00:08:00,272
From myself perhaps.

113
00:08:02,174 --> 00:08:03,713
I think...

114
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:06,792
You make a delirious interpretation.

115
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:10,092
I apologize for
being so frank with you.

116
00:08:11,134 --> 00:08:13,952
And there is something in you,
let me say...

117
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,690
I apologize for being so frank with you.

118
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:20,968
But there is a pig, a pink one,
inside of you.

119
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:24,109
I've set a trap for you.

120
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:26,248
I told you:

121
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:29,558
Take the machine to kill flies,

122
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,580
because the fly is the devil.

123
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:33,881
But it was the devil of another era.

124
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,907
Now the devil is a pig.

125
00:08:36,251 --> 00:08:37,820
A pink pig.

126
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:40,639
Who will look like David Niven.

127
00:08:41,058 --> 00:08:42,457
Who will be...

128
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:44,279
Very elegant.

129
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:46,293
Who will be very...

130
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:47,446
Very chic.

131
00:08:47,754 --> 00:08:50,296
And that.
It is inside of you.

132
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:55,986
I have high hopes
about the girl.

133
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,892
She's an angel who has too often
been possessed by the devil.

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,862
She's always
mixed up in dirty business.

135
00:09:03,441 --> 00:09:06,571
There's never the impression,
nor the truth besides,

136
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:08,568
that she's told the truth.

137
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:11,965
Yes.

138
00:09:12,628 --> 00:09:16,085
And what's even stranger,
is that she's found among thieves.

139
00:09:16,524 --> 00:09:20,002
And troublesome elements
who aren't even thieves.

140
00:09:20,258 --> 00:09:24,519
The underworld who emerge more numerous
each day, from the slums of Paris.

141
00:09:24,603 --> 00:09:26,736
And who are enraged.

142
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,816
She prevents, they say,
the students from studying.

143
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:34,500
The workers from working.
And they steal.

144
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,116
Prison

145
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:20,374
Here, Bulle!

146
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:26,969
Bulle, listen to me.
We have much to say to you.

147
00:10:27,304 --> 00:10:29,501
We think it is normal
and even desirable

148
00:10:29,621 --> 00:10:34,433
that a girl as intelligent as you are
interests herself in the problems...

149
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,699
We would even be interested in your
opinion on the possible consequences.

150
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,852
Because, reform, yes.
Chaos, no.

151
00:10:41,171 --> 00:10:45,814
Our approach rests on the extreme
sympathy we have for young girls.

152
00:10:48,007 --> 00:10:50,021
Momentarily gone bad.

153
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:30,126
Listen to me, please.

154
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:32,723
You must come to my place.

155
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:36,737
You really must.

156
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,269
I've loads of precious things.

157
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,562
Jewels, stones,
animals, lots of things.

158
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:49,385
There are no guards there.
I don't need, don't like them.

159
00:11:49,781 --> 00:11:53,516
You must come to my place because...
Because I want.

160
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:58,363
It's urgent. You must both come.
I don't like single women.

161
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:00,856
Here is my card.

162
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,810
Anyway, you won't find it.
No one does.

163
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:46,343
- What can I do?
- Can you hear me? - It hurts.

164
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:49,197
Can you hear me?

165
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:52,479
What can I do?

166
00:17:52,978 --> 00:17:55,272
You've dropped
all the dishes on the floor.

167
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:00,487
Hurts!

168
00:18:05,446 --> 00:18:06,144
Shit!

169
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:09,734
You've dropped
all the dishes on the floor.

170
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,492
- Where does it hurt?
- That hurts!

171
00:18:22,706 --> 00:18:24,502
- Where?
- That hurts!

172
00:18:24,913 --> 00:18:25,845
Where?

173
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,064
Where does it hurt?

174
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:33,988
- What can I do?
- Can you, with the axe...

175
00:18:34,187 --> 00:18:35,750
Smash the door?

176
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,822
The axe. Smash the door.

177
00:18:41,284 --> 00:18:44,431
Smash!
With the axe, the door.

178
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,391
Can you hear?

179
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:51,202
No!

180
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:53,895
- With the axe, smash!
- Can't!

181
00:18:54,868 --> 00:18:56,829
Kick in the glass.

182
00:20:46,167 --> 00:20:47,430
Gloves.

183
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:50,123
The worst is,
we can't see anything.

184
00:24:37,162 --> 00:24:38,292
Yes.

185
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:40,569
Do you remember...

186
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:43,632
- D'you think?
- Yes, yes, you are beautiful.

187
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:52,788
In your shitty thing there
with the nuns.

188
00:25:13,371 --> 00:25:16,429
- You've always had beautiful eyes.
- D'you like them? - I love them.

189
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:19,172
And you've always
had beautiful eyes.

190
00:25:27,563 --> 00:25:29,170
I'm less important then you.

191
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:32,812
- You must always be beautiful.
- Yes, it's important, don't you think?

192
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:33,854
Because...

193
00:25:34,483 --> 00:25:35,952
Like a little shepherdess.

194
00:25:36,072 --> 00:25:38,578
- They are marvelous.
- Really?

195
00:25:38,678 --> 00:25:40,462
You have fine, silky hair.

196
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,477
You have long, silky hair...

197
00:25:43,678 --> 00:25:44,853
Don't have to poo.

198
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:56,252
And you still have skin like a peach.

199
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:03,093
And with the money one can make.

200
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:06,018
Everywhere.

201
00:26:06,296 --> 00:26:08,004
needed to vomit.

202
00:26:08,572 --> 00:26:10,616
Vomit on the pillow.

203
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,352
Then she vomited and then...

204
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,856
More.

205
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:15,862
I would put...

206
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:18,996
the fur down.

207
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:21,005
- Fox.
- I've got one.

208
00:26:21,238 --> 00:26:24,030
Make me one. You sew
so well, with your fairy fingers.

209
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:25,240
Absolutely.

210
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:27,932
And la Rivière wasn't worth a penny.

211
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:32,213
It's because you're so pure.
You have purity.

212
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:39,573
- D'you think we can poo here?
- I don't know. On the commode.

213
00:32:43,311 --> 00:32:46,748
My proposals can do
no wrong in their place

214
00:32:47,491 --> 00:32:51,665
They were real, useful, honest,
in the sense that I gave them.

215
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:54,742
How often have vilified authors
and the indignant public

216
00:32:54,882 --> 00:32:57,512
protested against this way

217
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:02,828
of shredding a work,
defacing all parts,

218
00:33:03,043 --> 00:33:05,839
judging from the scraps
removed here and there

219
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:08,350
in the choice of an infidel accuser

220
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:11,373
who produced the evil himself,

221
00:33:12,603 --> 00:33:16,453
by detaching the whole
that corrects it and explains it,

222
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:20,730
in twisting everywhere
the true sense?

223
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:26,340
Let one judge the isolated maxims
of La Bruyere and La Rochefoucauld.

224
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:30,451
Would they still be just?

225
00:40:33,102 --> 00:40:38,007
You dropped all the dishes on the floor.
You dropped all the dishes on the floor.

226
00:40:41,484 --> 00:40:44,282
D'you see evil?
D'you see evil?

227
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:17,934
It's hell.

228
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:45,890
It's hell.

229
00:51:56,838 --> 00:52:02,284
He knew that nothing could resist
the lucidity of his gaze.

230
00:52:03,657 --> 00:52:05,633
The desire to...

231
00:52:06,278 --> 00:52:08,933
...that would scare... Death...

232
00:52:09,635 --> 00:52:13,411
My accumulated violence
fills me with silence.

233
00:52:21,506 --> 00:52:23,437
Impenetrable.

234
00:53:57,441 --> 00:53:59,232
Its story.

235
00:53:59,763 --> 00:54:01,692
you would think it ended badly.

236
00:54:03,466 --> 00:54:06,403
He tried to know

237
00:54:06,822 --> 00:54:09,312
and he was burned alive.

238
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,859
It reminds us of Sodom

239
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:13,761
imprisoned in the castle

240
00:54:14,237 --> 00:54:15,376
like Kafka.

241
00:54:15,747 --> 00:54:17,733
And the fire arrives.

242
00:54:18,451 --> 00:54:22,032
Whereas, he believed it was water,

243
00:54:22,414 --> 00:54:24,456
He thought he could

244
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,585
fight the fire.
It has not been possible.

245
00:54:27,837 --> 00:54:31,775
The pig that was in him died.

246
00:54:32,122 --> 00:54:34,923
With... the acolytes

247
00:54:35,717 --> 00:54:37,283
who had women's heads.

248
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:39,473
Me, I consider this story

249
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:42,586
as a premonitory dream.

250
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:46,262
Although I know nothing of it.

251
00:54:46,508 --> 00:54:49,025
since I never saw it.

252
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:51,646
nor filmed, nor told it.

253
00:54:54,807 --> 00:54:57,744
