1
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,021
I think you're quite wrong.

2
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,143
Won't never be like that.

3
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,895
Oh, Jimmy, you're so stupid.

4
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,442
Oh, it's not me who's stupid.

5
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,612
But can't you see there's
got to be something like that or...

6
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,236
or else all this will just have been
a waste of time.

7
00:01:57,326 --> 00:01:58,487
Maybe it has.

8
00:01:58,994 --> 00:02:01,327
Oh, Jimmy, I know you don't mean that.

9
00:02:01,413 --> 00:02:02,995
No, I suppose I don't, really.

10
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,697
But I think you've got your head
in the clouds.

11
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,703
And you've got your feet
so firmly fixed on the ground

12
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,501
you... you can't see any further
than the end of your nose.

13
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,296
Don't laugh at me.

14
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,045
I'm sorry, but after
all the nonsense you've been talking.

15
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,171
It's not nonsense.

16
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,547
Oh, alright. But I'm sorry

17
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,880
you'll never convince me
that things will ever be different.

18
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,182
The trouble with you, Jimmy, is that
you're not willing to do anything about it.

19
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,260
All you can do is pull everything to pieces

20
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,141
instead of trying to help build things up.

21
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,475
Excuse me, have you a match?

22
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,683
My lighter's not working.
- Yes, sure.

23
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,767
Thanks.

24
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,526
Argument?

25
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:39,482
Very much of one.

26
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:42,778
Public or private?
- Oh, public. About after the war.

27
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,111
Ah.

28
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,914
I say that people will insist
on things being different.

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,241
And I say they won't.

30
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:49,416
What do you say?

31
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,039
Some will, some won't.

32
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,916
Oh, that's a dull answer.

33
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,589
It needn't be if you begin
to take a good look at it.

34
00:02:56,968 --> 00:03:00,336
Let's suppose we took a little
cross-section of our people.

35
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:03,639
All with very different backgrounds
and surroundings.

36
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,139
A waitress. A landed baronet.

37
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,721
A charwoman. A businessman.

38
00:03:10,816 --> 00:03:14,981
And let's imagine these people
suddenly found themselves

39
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,062
out of their ordinary surroundings.

40
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,737
Nine people, we'll say.

41
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,986
We'll begin with the waitress.

42
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:23,784
I don't mind work, not even
with manageresses like you around

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,452
but I do like to eat when I'm working.

44
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,075
So there's your uniform, such as it is

45
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,827
and there's your wonderful list
of rules and regulations

46
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,034
and you know what you can do with 'em.
- Well!

47
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,540
Give me a double gin and lime, Bert.

48
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,795
And not so much lime.

49
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,296
What she been doing to you, Alice?

50
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,049
Oh, I'm packing up, that's all.

51
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,846
What, got a better job?
- Nope.

52
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,173
Well, what are you going to do then?

53
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,554
Give us another one, Bert.

54
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,978
Even if I find another job,
I don't suppose it'll be any better.

55
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,898
Still, it'll be a change.
I like to keep moving.

56
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,484
I had six months in London,
out Hammersmith way

57
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,484
and then 18 months in Newcastle,
where they call you 'hinny.'

58
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:02,691
And then six months in Birmingham.

59
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,946
Here, go easy. You're upset.

60
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,112
So would you be. Oh, I'm alright.

61
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,698
So long, Bert.
- All the best, kid.

62
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,454
It's a dark night.
- It always is!

63
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,161
Whoops! Christmas!

64
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,715
Alright, Simpson, I admit it ought to be
a valuable little property

65
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,008
but what's your proposition?

66
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,006
I have the option,
you provide the money

67
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,553
and so we split 50/50.

68
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,505
I see, and I suppose
you think that's smart, eh?

69
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,842
It's good business, isn't it?
- Oh, I don't know about that.

70
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,226
No, you're out of your depth.

71
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:33,646
Where's your option?
- Don't worry about that, Cudworth.

72
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,769
I'll have that option first thing
in the morning.

73
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,020
Oh, no, you won't.

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,693
'Cause I've got it right here.
In me pocket.

75
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,193
Blast!
- Hey, be careful.

76
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,864
This thing's got a wonky connection.

77
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,159
Now you've done it.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

78
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,986
That's always the trouble with you,
Simpson.

79
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,491
You never think ahead.

80
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,699
Well, wait here while I go and get
the porter to fix it.

81
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,001
That is if he's not gone home.
He's never here when you want him.

82
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:59,164
Looks like the whole lot has fused.
Jenkins!

83
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,506
Oh, good evening, Miss Loxfield.
- Good evening.

84
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:06,713
I don't suppose there are
any letters for me, are there?

85
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,797
I'm sorry, miss.

86
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,302
I don't really know why I keep asking.

87
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,102
I... I'm not really expecting anything,
only, well...

88
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,522
don't you ever feel that something exciting
might suddenly come through the post?

89
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,816
Well, no, miss, I can't say that I ever do.

90
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,485
There you are, Philippa.
- Oh, good evening, my lady.

91
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,062
It's a bit dark for your walk tonight.

92
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,192
Indeed.

93
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:26,232
Come along, Philippa.
- Yes, Mother.

94
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,784
I don't like that young man as much
as the one we had before.

95
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,244
I hope you weren't talking to him.
- Oh, no, Mother.

96
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,118
I was just asking
if there were any letters.

97
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:36,417
Your bridge was abominable tonight.
You simply weren't paying any attention.

98
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,460
I'm sorry, Mother.
- I'm quite Â£2 down.

99
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,254
But, Mother, you know
I hate playing bridge

100
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,047
and those people are so dull...

101
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,427
I like the weight of her, d'you know,
Baker.

102
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:50,097
I like the weight very much.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,051
I heard Mr Truscott say
he's very pleased with that club.

104
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,978
Alright, tell him I'll take it
and he can put it down to my account.

105
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,396
- I say, Gedney.
- Very good, sir.

106
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:01,021
Do you remember Sutton? Edgar Sutton?
Used to be a secretary fellow here?

107
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:03,979
I remember. In India, isn't he?
- That's right.

108
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,234
Dreamt about him the other night.
- As we are now talking about dreams

109
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,986
did I ever tell you about
my uncle Everard?

110
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,487
Well, as a matter of fact,
you've told me...

111
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:11,535
He was years in the Straits Settlements
and then came home

112
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,408
to be Joint Master
of the North Barsetshire.

113
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,285
Now, he used to dream regularly
once a month

114
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,991
that he was being chased
by a leopard.

115
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,919
The same leopard, mind you.
In North Barset.

116
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,624
Well, it just goes to show you
how queer things are

117
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,458
dreams and all that.

118
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:27,214
I say, is that the time?

119
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,045
It must be getting dark, I must be off.

120
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,596
Must you, really?

121
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,298
Good night, Barnaby.
- Good night, Gedney.

122
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,055
Good night, Baker.
Keep an eye on my club, won't you?

123
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:36,431
Very good, sir, I will.

124
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,853
I say, it is dark.

125
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,976
I never knew it to be dark quite so...

126
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,428
How goes it, Mrs Batley?

127
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,855
Oh, not too good, Mr Smithers.

128
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,980
Got them rheumatic pains
in me legs again something cruel.

129
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,153
Well, you get off home
and have a nice lie-down.

130
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,979
Yes, I wish I could.

131
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,031
Help me on with this coat,
will you, Mr Smithers?

132
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,858
Certainly, Mrs Batley.
- Thank you.

133
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:36,912
And steady with that left arm.
That ain't too good neither.

134
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,330
Getting old, that's what it is.

135
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,874
Not you, you're as lively as a kitten.
- Ah, go on.

136
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,793
Nice cup of tea will you put right.

137
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,212
Yes, well, I've got a bit of shopping
to do first.

138
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,711
And a bit more cleaning when I get home.

139
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,793
Now, where's me shopping basket...

140
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,888
So I said to him,
'You're quite wrong, you know.

141
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:06,021
My name's Stritton and I'm in
the West Midland Bank of Leamington.'

142
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:08,478
Then he pretended he'd seen me there,
but of course he hadn't.

143
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,358
Well, I don't see why
he shouldn't have done.

144
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,358
Where's the box?
- I had it put in the van.

145
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:15,818
Well, do you think it's safe?
- I should think so. I don't see why...

146
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,244
Well, people are always stealing things

147
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,788
and Uncle will never forgive us
if we lose his precious engravings.

148
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,786
Well, I never wanted to have them,
they're so...

149
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:24,163
Yes, I know, Malcolm, but I knew he'd
be pleased if we borrowed them.

150
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,496
Remember, he has a lot of property
and no one to leave it to.

151
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,330
You must go and see if the box is there.

152
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:29,632
Now, Dorothy...
- Malcolm.

153
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,550
I've been worried about
something for the last half hour.

154
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,717
It must be the box.

155
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,670
You don't know,
it may have been stolen.

156
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,050
Please go and see.

157
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:41,478
Alright, Dorothy, but really, every time
we go to Tewkesbury it's fuss, fuss, fuss.

158
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:51,028
Malcolm! Malcolm!

159
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,401
Malcolm, where are you?

160
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,160
Anyone else want to get trouble?

161
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,038
Yes, I do.
- What?

162
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,664
You heard what I said.

163
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,371
You've been hazing us
all the way across

164
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:09,876
just for the pleasure of it.

165
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,674
Just because you and the blasted owners
have got us where you want us.

166
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,593
Well, I'm taking no more from you.

167
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,943
If you want any more,
you know where to come for it.

168
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:34,404
You alright, Joe?

169
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,024
Yes, I'm alright.

170
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,703
I'll feel better
when I've had some fresh air.

171
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,170
<i>Am I back here on purpose, am I?</i>

172
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,504
<i>Malcolm, where are you?</i>

173
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,884
<i>Alright, Dorothy.</i>

174
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,011
<i>Malcolm, this way.</i>

175
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,686
<i>I can't imagine where we are.</i>

176
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:17,110
Philippa!

177
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,234
Philippa!

178
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,318
Where are you?

179
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:24,371
Alright, Mother, I'm coming.

180
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,412
Well, where are you?

181
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,119
Really, Philippa, how you can
leave me alone at a moment like this

182
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,624
when anything might happen.

183
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,455
But I wasn't leaving you alone, Mother.

184
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,008
I only stopped because I thought I heard
somebody else moving about.

185
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,051
All the more reason
why you shouldn't leave me.

186
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:40,801
We must stick together.
- Yes, Mother.

187
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,346
Can you still hear someone?
- No. Not now.

188
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,099
Where are we?
- I haven't the foggiest.

189
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,226
You haven't any idea?
- No.

190
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,807
None at all.

191
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,393
Look.

192
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,613
- What is it?
- I don't know.

193
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,285
But I do know it isn't Bournemouth.

194
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,034
Let's go up.

195
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,710
It might lead anywhere.

196
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,537
But at least it'll lead somewhere.

197
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,748
We don't know where we are now,
so we may as well go up.

198
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,333
We won't be any worse off.

199
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,172
Come on, Mother.

200
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:28,594
Listen. I can hear somebody.

201
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,145
Philippa...
- Shh.

202
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,528
Yes. There's somebody behind us.

203
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,740
Oh, good evening.

204
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,825
I suppose it is evening, isn't it?

205
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,499
I suppose so. Well, we're a bit mixed up.

206
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,042
So am I.

207
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,744
Well, we better introduce ourselves, eh?

208
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,919
Cudworth's my name.

209
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:58,090
I'm Philippa Loxfield
and this is my mother, Lady Loxfield.

210
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:00,008
How do you do.
- How do you do, Mr Cudworth.

211
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,757
Can you tell me if this is Bournemouth?

212
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,180
Bournemouth?
Oh, no, I don't suppose so.

213
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,470
I never go to Bournemouth,
I don't like the place.

214
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,426
Well, where are we, then?

215
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,510
Now you've got me.

216
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,395
You see, you're the first people I've seen.

217
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,061
Let's move on a bit, shall we?

218
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,195
Well, I suppose we might as well.

219
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:23,024
It's a funny sort of place.

220
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:28,033
Looks like... a wall... steps.

221
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,330
- It is a wall.
- That's right.

222
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,533
Better a wall than nothing if you ask me.

223
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,409
Certainly.

224
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,921
Well, Mother, we're somewhere now.

225
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:41,091
What is the use of saying
we're somewhere if we don't know where?

226
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,293
Really, Philippa.

227
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,547
Did you say your name was Loxfield?
You're not in tin, are you?

228
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:47,927
I've never been in tin.

229
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,600
No, my husband was
in the Colonial Service.

230
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,929
Hmm. I'm a commercial man, myself.

231
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,514
Well, now what should we do?

232
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,476
Well, we'd better go up the steps.

233
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,648
Alright.

234
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,821
There are two or three very
important wires I'd like to send

235
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,523
as soon as I can find a post office
that's open.

236
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:06,988
What's the joke, young lady?

237
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,740
I believe you've got it all wrong.

238
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:11,038
You won't find any post offices
round here.

239
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,241
You don't know anything about it,
Philippa.

240
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,543
And I daresay Mr Cudworth
will soon find a post office or something.

241
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,749
Oh, that reminds me.

242
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,173
I ought to have written to your Aunt Edith
to tell her to be sure

243
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,672
not to come and stay with us
till the end of next week.

244
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,343
Perhaps it is the end of next week now.

245
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,046
That doesn't make sense, young lady.

246
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,803
Well, being here at all
doesn't make sense to me.

247
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,133
Excuse me?

248
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,357
Excuse me?

249
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,357
Well, they're talking English, they was.
There's one good thing.

250
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,029
None of that jabber-jabber-jabber

251
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,858
like them poor foreigners
in the tram the other day.

252
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,862
I say!

253
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,908
Who's there?

254
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,534
Oh! I say!
- Yes? Where are you?

255
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,740
I say, look here.

256
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,793
Can you tell me how far I am
from the clubhouse?

257
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,120
What clubhouse?

258
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,047
Well, the West Windlesham
Golf Club, of course.

259
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:03,874
Sorry, but I never heard of it.

260
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,381
I live out Walthamstow way, meself.

261
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:10,556
Walthamstow? Good heavens!
This isn't Walthamstow, is it?

262
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,758
No, t'aint a bit like it.

263
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,060
So I daresay it's what you say,
West-What's-It.

264
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,057
West Windlesham.

265
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:21,359
Ought to be, 'cause I was there.
Tell me, do you play golf? Mm-hm?

266
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,276
Me play golf, eh?

267
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:29,109
Nobody never asked me that before.

268
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,694
I had to come here to be asked that.
- Yes, very amusing.

269
00:14:31,788 --> 00:14:35,327
Look, if anyone should ask for me,
I'm Sir George Gedney.

270
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,204
Sir George Gedney.
- Fancy.

271
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,751
You haven't seen anyone about,
have you?

272
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:43,126
Yes, there was two ladies and a gentleman
that just went up them steps.

273
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,549
Up those steps?
Thank you very much.

274
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,547
I suppose they will know
where they are.

275
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:51,597
Why, they live round here probably.
Sure to, eh?

276
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,470
Well, I'm a bit tired meself
or I'd have called up to them.

277
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,550
Yes, I assure you.

278
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,262
I say! I say! Anybody there?

279
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,847
Anybody about?

280
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,359
Malcolm!

281
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,282
It ain't Sir George Gedney you want, is it?

282
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,358
No.

283
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,819
I was calling for my husband.

284
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:18,370
I'm Mrs Stritton.
- I'm Mrs Batley.

285
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,291
Was your husband with you?
- Yes.

286
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:22,335
We were together till about
ten minutes ago.

287
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,039
We're always together.
We always have been.

288
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,342
Yeah, well, that's how some likes it
and some don't.

289
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,760
Perhaps we're dead.

290
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:33,931
No, we'd feel different
if we was dead.

291
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,383
Either we'd feel nothing at all
or we'd feel different

292
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,560
and I feel just the same as I did.

293
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:42,139
Feet achin', rheumatic pains in me legs
and all.

294
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,440
Just the same.

295
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,734
And besides, I've got me shopping basket.

296
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:48,813
And I wouldn't have that with me
if I was dead, that'd be silly.

297
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,613
I'm going to look for him.

298
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,816
Malcolm!

299
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:53,859
Malcolm!

300
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,075
Malcolm!

301
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,541
And then I told her exactly
what I thought of her

302
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,838
and it did me good.

303
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,667
So I walked down to the bar after having
had a couple of double gins a limes

304
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,171
it was pitch dark outside

305
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:13,379
and the next minute it seems like
I'm wandering around here

306
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,634
asking you where we are.

307
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,636
I'm no better off than you.

308
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:20,219
You see, I was in a train
going to Tewkesbury.

309
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,020
Tewkesbury?

310
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,189
I went there once to the Red Lion.

311
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,811
Hello, who's that?

312
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,064
Excuse me, but are you Mr Stritton?

313
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,146
Yes, I'm Stritton.

314
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,105
Well, your wife's looking for you.

315
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,283
Yes, of course. I've been looking for her.

316
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,736
Since when?
- No, really, I have.

317
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,866
Where is she?

318
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,288
She went on there somewhere.

319
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,164
Oh.

320
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,540
Er, Dorothy?

321
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,417
Well, say it as if you meant it.

322
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,250
Doro-thy!

323
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,424
Malcolm!

324
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,002
Yes, dear, here I am.

325
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,882
Here he is!

326
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,427
Malcolm, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

327
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,726
I've been looking for you.
- Can't have been looking very hard.

328
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,052
Oh, he was.

329
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,603
Don't let's waste any more time, Malcolm.

330
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,180
We ought to find out exactly
where we are.

331
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,641
Unless, of course, your friend's
already told you.

332
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,897
Excuse me.
- Come along, Malcolm.

333
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,444
I've been looking for you everywhere.

334
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,147
I was dreadfully worried.

335
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:15,107
And then I find you with
that awful woman.

336
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,067
Really, Malcolm,
where did you pick her up?

337
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:19,027
I simply can't understand
you behaving like this...

338
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,079
Well, we know who wears
the trousers there, don't we?

339
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,283
I knew it 'fore I saw him.

340
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:25,913
Have a cigarette?
- No, thank you, dear.

341
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,369
Never took to it.

342
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,420
Well, I feel better.

343
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,090
I don't know where I am or what's
going to happen, but I feel better.

344
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,293
And anyhow I didn't know what was going
to happen before this happened.

345
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,003
So what's the odds?
- That's right, dear.

346
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,588
Ever been a waitress?
- No.

347
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,595
But my cousin's youngest is a waitress.

348
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,052
Looks nice in her uniform, too, she do.

349
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,182
That's a life, I'm telling you.

350
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:46,764
Talk about your feet.

351
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:49,565
I sometimes felt mine must be
as big as footballs.

352
00:17:49,652 --> 00:17:52,269
And it's a mean life, too.
Gosh, it's mean.

353
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,695
You wouldn't believe.

354
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,023
Most of the time the management's
trying to cheat the customers

355
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:58,154
and half the time the customers
are trying to cheat the management.

356
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,236
You don't say.
- But the women...

357
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,662
Half of them think they're buying you

358
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,410
along with their pot of tea
and beans on toast.

359
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,866
I could've killed them.

360
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,126
Men aren't so bad.

361
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,625
Except, of course, half of them
got their pig's eyes sticking out their head

362
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,377
trying to imagine what
you've got under your uniform

363
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:13,627
and some of them pinch you, too.

364
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,301
That's right.
One of 'em pinched me once.

365
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:20,097
Upper Clapton Road, it was.
Outside a greengrocer's.

366
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,218
Well...

367
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,305
if you don't mind, dear, I'm just
going to see if there's something

368
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,887
a bit more comfortable
further up them steps.

369
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,517
What's the matter with people anyhow?

370
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,600
They're all strung up inside, dear

371
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,777
'cause they ain't getting
their little bits of happiness. That's all.

372
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:36,105
Yes, and then they try to take it out
on somebody else, eh?

373
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,530
That's right.

374
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,075
Hello! Who's this?

375
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,784
Hello, beautiful.

376
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:46,035
Yes, I might have known.

377
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,957
There'd have to be one of you
conquering heroes.

378
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,794
Talking to yourself, beautiful?
- Don't call me beautiful.

379
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,793
Why? Aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

380
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,375
Well, I've seen worse.
- So have I. Lots.

381
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,711
But I don't like that tone of voice,
so give it a rest, see?

382
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,592
And if you must know, I was talking
to my friend who's gone up here.

383
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,469
Why has she?
- Because she wants to sit down

384
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,050
have a rest and be quiet.

385
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,351
And so would you if you were a woman.

386
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:08,599
Huh. If I'd been a woman,
I'd have packed up years ago.

387
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,430
Yes? Well, women don't pack up.

388
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,265
If they pack up,
everything would pack up.

389
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,771
Well, it can for me.

390
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:21,150
Where are we?
- Search me.

391
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,906
You see, I was nursing a ship's engine.

392
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,113
I've been doing it right across
the South Atlantic.

393
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:29,625
It's an old engine. At least as old as I am.

394
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,202
In fact, I'd say older. Yes, older.

395
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,582
Oh, are you sure?

396
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,289
I feel we ought to get this thing settled.

397
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,249
No, beautiful.
- Oh, drop it.

398
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,209
Hey, you're not bad-tempered, are you?

399
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,044
No, not as a rule.
- Well, then, take it easy.

400
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,504
Nobody's trying to insult you.

401
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,805
Now, then, listen.

402
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,803
I've been a waitress
and I've been a barmaid.

403
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,011
For ten years I've had jobs where fellas
like you come up with your 'beautifuls'

404
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,347
and we have to pretend to think
you're very witty.

405
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,432
Customer's always right, eh?

406
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,860
Yes. And I can tell you plenty
about that, too.

407
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,734
But the point is, I want a rest
from this 'beautiful' line just now, see?

408
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:02,066
Certainly. What's your name?

409
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,569
Alice Foster. What's yours?

410
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,780
Joe Dinmore, Miss Foster.

411
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,614
Or is it Mrs Foster?

412
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:12,122
No, it isn't. What do you do?

413
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,204
I've done everything, Miss Foster,
except make money.

414
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,793
I was in Australia one time driving tractors.

415
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,922
I was in South America one time,
foreman on a railway gang.

416
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,843
Didn't you ever try England?
- Huh?

417
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,637
Now and then, between time.

418
00:20:24,724 --> 00:20:26,465
I was saving England up
until I'd made me packet.

419
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,346
I've done a bit of docking.
I was on a coaster one time...

420
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,177
Alright, Mr Dinmore, alright,
I get the idea.

421
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:32,979
You've just tried this and that
and now you're trying this.

422
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,227
Well, I'm not trying this.

423
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,776
Last time I remember anything,
I was going on deck to get some fresh air.

424
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,276
I've been laying myself five to one
I'd wake up in the jug somewhere

425
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,357
with a head on me like an old boiler.

426
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:44,908
But if so, I don't see where you come in...

427
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:46,660
Miss Foster.

428
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,078
No, I don't either.

429
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,451
And this "Miss Foster's" getting me down.

430
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,702
Thought you wanted some politeness.

431
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,249
Yes, alright, but don't overdo it.

432
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,006
Hello, what's this?

433
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,754
Looks like a kind of sundial.

434
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:05,053
Hey, there's my friend. She's asleep.

435
00:21:05,139 --> 00:21:08,007
Ah, good ol' Ma. Let her sleep.

436
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,051
What kind of a place is this?

437
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,307
Reminds me of a place I saw
in Peru one time.

438
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,019
Wouldn't be a kind of a castle,
would it?

439
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,476
Might be.
Then again, it might be a town.

440
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,028
Lots of these old towns have walls
all round 'em.

441
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,480
I've seen them all over the place.

442
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,234
And you can't see a thing here.

443
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,411
Look a hell of a drop, though.

444
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,578
No getting in this way.

445
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:37,289
I say, Joe.

446
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,956
What if there were something
absolutely wonderful down there?

447
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,420
How do you mean, wonderful?

448
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,044
I don't know, quite.

449
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,172
I know if I'd saw it, though.

450
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,223
Something different.

451
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,686
Not a bit like London or Birmingham
or Newcastle.

452
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:58,391
Nor Liverpool, Glasgow, Port Said,
Aden, Bombay.

453
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:03,229
Singapore, Sydney, New York,
Los Angeles, Chicago.

454
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,608
Ever since I could remember

455
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:08,157
I've always wanted to come across,
suddenly, something wonderful.

456
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,610
Or different.

457
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,071
Don't laugh.
- I'm not laughing.

458
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,827
You were smiling.
- Oh, well, that's different, Alice.

459
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:17,705
That's friendly.
- Yes, that's different.

460
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,042
I used to carry a little book
of old Walt Whitman around with me.

461
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,997
I could spout it by the yard.
Do you know what he said?

462
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,093
'I dream'd in a dream I saw a city...'

463
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,630
Oh, no, what was it?

464
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,638
'...invincible to the attacks
of the whole of the rest of the earth.

465
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,646
I dream'd that was the new
City of Friends.'

466
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,724
Yes, Joe, that's it.
- Yeah.

467
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,684
Sounds fine, doesn't it?

468
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,735
I'm glad he said he only dreamt it, though.

469
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,688
Huh. What a hope.

470
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,700
Well, I'm a fool, I suppose,
but that's what I've always wanted.

471
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,450
And it's what, in a way,
because I'm a fool, I've always expected.

472
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,667
I think that's why I've never
settled down. You know?

473
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,789
I'm just the chap who does know, Alice.

474
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,545
I've always thought that if I moved on
and tried another job somewhere else

475
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,966
it might somehow be there.

476
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:11,429
And it never was. Was it?

477
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,507
No, Joe, it never was.

478
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,140
Ever call yourself a mug?
- Yes.

479
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,595
But don't you try calling me one.

480
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:22,649
OK. I've been calling myself one
for 15 years now.

481
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:24,442
No, longer.
- Here, steady.

482
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,110
You're not that old.
- I'm 35.

483
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,189
Well, what's that?
- Nothing. Yet.

484
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:30,615
Guess how old I am.

485
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,114
22.
- Go on. I'm 28.

486
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,116
I don't believe it.
- Yes, and I look it. You wait.

487
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,414
Mind you, I'm a bit tired, you know,
and the old face is feeling it

488
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,911
what with one thing and another.

489
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,577
You're alright, Alice.

490
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:45,839
Thanks, Joe.

491
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,210
I say! I say!
- What is it?

492
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,296
Do you happen to know
where I can find a post office?

493
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,383
Well, what's the joke? Well, go on, tell me.

494
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,218
No one can say I can't enjoy a joke.

495
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,850
I'm sorry, mister.
- Cudworth's the name.

496
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,774
Oh, well, I'm sorry Mr Cudworth,
but honestly, I don't know why I laughed.

497
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:06,602
It suddenly came over me,
seeing you standing there all fussed.

498
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,607
Wanting a post office?
- Yes!

499
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,154
I don't see anything funny about it!

500
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,697
What do you want a post office for?

501
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,070
'Cause I want to send
a couple of telegrams.

502
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,150
Very urgent business, you know.

503
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,906
Oh, business, making money.
- That's it.

504
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,282
Why? Do you need some money
very badly?

505
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,581
No, I've plenty, but that's not the point.
- Well, what is the point?

506
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:21,750
Oh, you're one of these
argumentative chaps, are you?

507
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,872
Well, the point is...
- Ah, stuff it.

508
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,378
Well, what are we all doing here,
anyhow?

509
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,127
Well, I'm having a nice rest.

510
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,833
What do you do when you're not
having a nice rest?

511
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:33,546
Look after a house full of people
and go out cleaning three days a week.

512
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,096
Yeah, aren't you sharp and nosey, eh?

513
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,595
Yes, and I'll bet you've never kept a job
for more than a year, have you?

514
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:38,675
You mind your own business.

515
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:42,228
Now, I'd say you're one of those chaps
who started out as a black-coated worker

516
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,146
clerk or what-not.
- Right.

517
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,600
And then by never missing a trick
and giving all your mind to it

518
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:49,232
pushed yourself pretty high up
into the boss and capitalist class.

519
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,937
And you wouldn't be
very far wrong neither.

520
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:53,440
What are you, a mechanic or something?

521
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,866
Right, mechanic or something.

522
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,488
Jack-of-all-trades, eh?
- Right.

523
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,661
Here today and gone tomorrow, eh?
- Right every time.

524
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,204
Where's it got you?

525
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,408
Well, it's got me here.
Where's your line got you?

526
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,744
If I told you what I was worth,
you'd be surprised.

527
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,795
Surprised? I wouldn't even be interested.

528
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,292
Now, Joe, don't be rude.

529
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,383
You don't look like a Joe. Does he?

530
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,676
No, he don't.

531
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:16,880
Here, what is this?
Are you women ganging up on me already?

532
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:18,636
Do you know much about women,
Mr what's-it?

533
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:20,308
Yes, I keep away from 'em.

534
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,013
Yeah, I'll bet you do, too. Take your
mind off your business, don't they?

535
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,474
That's right. Always interfering. Messy, too.

536
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,060
Messy? What do you mean, messy?

537
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:32,692
Ooh, I know what he means.
Mind you, he's wrong.

538
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,739
But I know what he means.

539
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:36,657
You know, you ask me,
I think there's a lot to be said

540
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,532
for that old idea about women's place
being in the home.

541
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:41,578
How many girls have you got
in your office?

542
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,243
Six.

543
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,494
How many women have you got
in your home?

544
00:25:44,585 --> 00:25:45,541
I haven't got any.

545
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,289
Then what's the good of telling I should
think the woman's place is in the home?

546
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,745
You don't believe a word of it.

547
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,456
If you did, you'd pop those six girls
from your office in your home

548
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,463
and make a start that way.
- Oh, talk sense!

549
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,139
Most extraordinary, Lady Loxfield.
Never known anything like it.

550
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,263
Those Logan girls!
Which one was it? Kitty?

551
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:06,312
No, Dolly. Kitty came rather
a nasty cropper, you remember.

552
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,017
I used to go duck shooting
with their brother, Piggy Logan.

553
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,352
There used to be a Logan around
the Thames and Medway Trust.

554
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:13,903
Very sharp he was, too.

555
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,696
You couldn't put anything past that Logan.

556
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:18,150
Not the same family.
Not very brainy, these Logans.

557
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:20,826
Excuse me. I'm Sir George Gedney.
- My name's Cudworth.

558
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,279
Are you in the City?
- Yes, you?

559
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,238
Oh, Lord, no. I often wish I was.

560
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,325
I've got two or three
potty little directorships

561
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,829
that take me up to town now and then.

562
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,910
That's all.
- Really?

563
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,041
By the way, do you ever run across
Buster Clayhorn?

564
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,338
He used to command the Blues.

565
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,167
No, I never knew these Army men,
I've spent me life in the City.

566
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,172
Queer. I thought you might
have run across Buster.

567
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:39,424
You might have lent him a hundred
now and again.

568
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,882
Good Lord, I'm not a moneylender.
- No, of course not.

569
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,056
Er, I'm sorry.

570
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,056
Lady Loxfield, did you ever run across
Buster Clayhorn?

571
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,853
There were some Dorset Clayhorns
I used to know.

572
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,021
Oh, not the same.

573
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:51,350
Buster was one of the Leicester Clayhorns.

574
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,230
You sound as if you are
talking about cattle.

575
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,233
Not at all, I'm talking about
a dear old friend of mine.

576
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,198
Look, look! I say, look!

577
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,117
- What is it?
- There's a city down there!

578
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,824
- A city! Oh, let's have a look!
- Philippa!

579
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,534
There's a city down there!
- A city?

580
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,041
It's all misty yet, but I can just see it.
Look, Joe.

581
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:13,417
I am looking, Alice.

582
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:14,873
I can't see anything
but a lot of ground mist.

583
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,558
I'm not arguing, Dorothy.

584
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,768
There's no point in having an argument

585
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,603
when we don't know what's happened
to us or where we've got to.

586
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,233
Well, that's what I've been
saying to you all along.

587
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,359
Hello, what's happening?

588
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,987
We think there's a city down there.
- Oh, really? A city!

589
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,444
Well, go on, see if you can see it.
- Well, wouldn't you like to see it?

590
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,495
No, I don't believe anybody
can see anything.

591
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:54,333
Well, what do you think of it, Joe?

592
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,665
I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

593
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,842
Well, I've seen places before
that look good at first.

594
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,379
You'd see 'em

595
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,304
from a long way off after weeks at sea

596
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,053
and you'd think you were
sailing into heaven.

597
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:09,807
When you got inside 'em, God, they stank.

598
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,847
Well, we're not talking about smells now.

599
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,058
I'm not either. I mean the carry-on
there was so terrible.

600
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:18,816
Poor devils sitting about in rags
with their ribs all showing through.

601
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,440
Kids crawling around the gutters
with their faces running sores.

602
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,570
Oh, shut up.

603
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,368
Don't spoil it.

604
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,788
Alright, I won't, but that's what I meant
when I said I didn't know.

605
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,906
Christians awake!

606
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,120
Look! All of you, look!

607
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,426
Look!

608
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,416
Well, nobody's going to break
that door down in a hurry.

609
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:07,842
No bell or knocker or anything.

610
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,547
Well, even if there was

611
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,805
I don't see what right we have
to go ringing or banging at it.

612
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,101
We don't know who lives there.

613
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:16,770
Well, we can ask where we are, can't we?

614
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,019
Well, there's nothing to open it with.

615
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,021
No handle or anything.

616
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:24,020
No, it's not that sort of door.

617
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,151
Not what sort of door?

618
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:30,110
This door's either tight shut as it is now
or else it's wide open.

619
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,654
That's the sort of door it is.

620
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:35,411
It's sure to open, sooner or later.

621
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:37,750
Queer.

622
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:41,125
Malcolm, if you don't bang on that door
then I will.

623
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,376
Oh, well, of course. I will.

624
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,050
I wouldn't bother, pal, they won't reply.

625
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:48,260
You heard what he said, dear.

626
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,088
Of course I heard what he said!

627
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,598
It's no use, my dear.

628
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,725
That door,
it'll open when it wants to open.

629
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,855
And not before.

630
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,352
You'll go in, of course?

631
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:40,855
Oh, rather, a place that size,
well worth looking at.

632
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,729
Don't you think so, Mr, erm...?
- Stritton.

633
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,230
London?
- No, Leamington.

634
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,607
I'm in the West Midland Bank there.
- Can't say I know it.

635
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,905
I've heard of it, of course,
but I can't really say I know it.

636
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,324
I bank at Barclays, myself,
have done for years.

637
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,986
And where do you bank, Miss Foster?

638
00:31:55,956 --> 00:31:59,040
Post Office Savings, Mr Dinmore.
How 'bout you?

639
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,459
The London and Wide World
Rolling Stone No Moss Limited.

640
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:04,083
Very fun.
- Can't see it, myself.

641
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,586
You know, Cudworth, there ought to be
something in your lane down here.

642
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,668
Rather, nothing like having
a good look round.

643
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,219
Used to spend me holidays keeping
me eyes and ears open.

644
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,548
Picked up a controlling interest
that way once in the Tormouth Trams.

645
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,508
Sold out afterwards, of course.

646
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,389
Tram's no good to me.
- Quite right.

647
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,015
Tram's no good to anybody.

648
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,563
What is any good to you?

649
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,265
- Trying to be smart?
- Not especially.

650
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,271
Never pays with me, you know.
- I daresay.

651
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,602
But what is any good to you?

652
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,813
Money is.
- Why? What do you do with it?

653
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,693
Make more money!
- So what?

654
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,820
Now, listen, and don't think
you know it all.

655
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,867
Have you been kicked about?
- Yes, plenty.

656
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,072
Well, I haven't. Why? Too much money!

657
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,579
Now who's laughing?
- Well, I'm not crying.

658
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,706
No, but he has you there, though.
Must have money. Don't I know it.

659
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,004
Are you what they call an aristocrat?

660
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,422
I don't know about that.

661
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,670
I'm seventh baronet if that's anything.

662
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,128
I've got a place in Wiltshire.
Landed gentry, I suppose. Why?

663
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,929
I wasn't sure.

664
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:59,225
The way you people made the mistake
was in ganging up with these money boys.

665
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:01,348
You ought to have ganged up with us,
the crowd, the mob

666
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:02,474
the people without any money.

667
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:03,896
But you didn't.

668
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,350
It's too late now.
- Quite.

669
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,983
I haven't the foggiest notion
what you're talking about. Sorry.

670
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:12,859
Do you know what he's talking about,
Cudworth?

671
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,861
Yes, and he's wrong.

672
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:18,194
Care for a stroll, Lady Loxfield?
It's no use hanging around here.

673
00:33:18,288 --> 00:33:21,656
I quite agree. Come along, Philippa.
- I'd rather stay, Mother.

674
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,208
I want you to come Philippa.
- Yes, Mother.

675
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,627
Ought to be plenty of money around here.
- You don't say.

676
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:27,920
Oh, no doubt about that.

677
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,713
Chance to get in on the ground floor.

678
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,256
You know, some of these people
have the assets

679
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,380
and they don't know how to use 'em.
Now, you take South America...

680
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,881
Did you hear those two?

681
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,296
Typical specimens of the boss class.

682
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,928
Grab, grab, grab.
It's all they care about.

683
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,759
So what do you care about?

684
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,140
That's not the point.
- Well, then, what is the point?

685
00:33:44,231 --> 00:33:45,893
The point is, here's two
typical specimens...

686
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,224
Oh, shut up with your 'typical specimens.'
- What's the matter with you?

687
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,651
It isn't what the matter with me.
It's what the matter with you.

688
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,820
Here we are and down there
is a wonderful place

689
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,693
like nothing we've ever seen before.

690
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:56,240
And all you can do
is to shake your fat head

691
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,658
and say you don't know
what it's like

692
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,985
and then pay no more attention

693
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,820
because you're bothering with
your typical specimens of the boss class.

694
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:03,531
Well, so what?
- So I say you're as bad as they are.

695
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:05,582
If not worse!
- Like hell I am!

696
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,706
Oh, I might have known,
I might have known!

697
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:09,287
Here, listen!
- Oh, shut up!

698
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,459
What's the matter with her?

699
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,511
- I don't know, I'm sure.
- I'm surprised at that.

700
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,713
You talked to her for long enough.

701
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,673
Now, Dorothy, you know perfectly well
I was looking for you.

702
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,724
Yes, you told me that before.
- Alright, alright.

703
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,552
It isn't alright!

704
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:32,188
My wife's rather upset.
She's not too strong, you know.

705
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,771
And this queer business, well,
you can imagine.

706
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,400
She's bad-tempered,
that's what's the matter with her.

707
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:38,574
So's that other Judy, Alice.

708
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,698
Women seem to lose their temper
so suddenly without any real reason.

709
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,531
Oh, no, Mr Stritton,
there's always a reason.

710
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:48,083
Now, Mrs Stritton, she went off in a huff,
as you might say, like that

711
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:51,037
'cause as you said,
she's upset and worried

712
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:53,498
and I expect she's one of them
who went they start worrying

713
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,504
soon begin to worry about everything.

714
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,507
So when she catches you talking
to that young woman, Alice

715
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,634
she feels more uncertain still

716
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:04,593
and then she loses her temper with you
'cause you made her feel like that.

717
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,643
Just when she needed a bit of comfort.

718
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,892
Ma, I can see you know it all.

719
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,817
Well, what about the other one, Alice?
What made her fly off the handle?

720
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:16,567
Oh, I don't know that I ought to let on
about her.

721
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:17,897
Oh, go on, Ma.

722
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:23,366
Well, you see, that Alice is one
that's had a lot of disappointments.

723
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:26,743
She meets you here and fancies you

724
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,325
and then she's disappointed in you

725
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,412
and that makes her mad at herself
for expecting anything

726
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,497
and being disappointed again.

727
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,050
And then she gets mad at you
'cause you made her mad at herself.

728
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,425
- That's too simple altogether.
- It's better if it's simple.

729
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:44,052
Not with me it isn't. And I'll tell you why.

730
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,010
I'm not a simple character,
I'm complicated, I am. Are you?

731
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:50,684
Well... no, I wouldn't say I was.

732
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:52,185
But not simple either.

733
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,982
Somewhere between the two, I suppose.

734
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:56,186
My trouble is I don't believe
in the revolution.

735
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:58,817
I'm a revolutionary who can't
believe in the revolution.

736
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:02,241
You can see where that lands a fellow.
Nowhere. Or here.

737
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:04,034
What you want's a nice little home.

738
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,237
I don't want a nice little home.

739
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,664
I spent my life running away
from nice little homes.

740
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,993
And where's it got you?
- I just said that. I'm nowhere.

741
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,044
But that's because I can't believe
in the revolution.

742
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,543
- What revolution?
- The one that's on its way.

743
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,044
Hoo, you're for it, alright.

744
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,797
And wait till you see what it does to
Leamington and the West Midland Bank

745
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,549
and I'll bet you're very, very fond
of Leamington

746
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:25,177
and the West Midland Bank, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

747
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,382
Well, you surprise me.

748
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,183
Leamington doesn't suit me,
never has done.

749
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:30,886
As for the West Midland Bank,
well, to be frank

750
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,063
I consider it to be completely
out of date and...

751
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,765
Go on, tell me the worst.

752
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,522
And an obstacle to true
economic progress.

753
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,444
Well, well, well.
- And another thing

754
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:42,023
I consider the chairman of the bank,
Sir Herbert Groosby-Perkins

755
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,404
a mean and contemptible old toad.

756
00:36:44,494 --> 00:36:46,577
Well, that's fine, then why just
whisper it to me?

757
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,655
Tell everybody!
Shout it at the top of your voice!

758
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,660
I'll bet you daren't.
Do you good, you know.

759
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,289
Time you let off steam after pussy-footing
in that Leamington bank for years.

760
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:58,043
Go on, tell 'em! Let it rip!
I'll dare you to!

761
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,123
Alright.

762
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,722
I consider the chairman of the bank

763
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:08,390
Sir Herbert Groosby-Perkins

764
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:11,059
a mean and contemptible old toad!

765
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:21,024
Good! How do you feel?
- I feel better.

766
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,777
Malcolm, what on earth are you doing
shouting like that?

767
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,779
I thought you'd gone mad.
- No.

768
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,236
What's the good of saying no?
Tell her you have gone mad.

769
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,410
What do you mean?

770
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,829
I thought you might like him better mad.

771
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,032
You've had him sane long enough,
didn't seem to make much of it.

772
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,118
Malcolm, are you alright?

773
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,309
Tell me, why can't you believe
in the revolution?

774
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:55,263
I can't believe in the revolution
because I've gone sour.

775
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,848
I don't see people making
anything good together.

776
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,774
They always end up making
something bad.

777
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,068
When they do make
anything good

778
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:02,816
they don't do it together
but by themselves.

779
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:04,442
But if the revolution's to be any use

780
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,194
they've got to make
something good together.

781
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,446
See what I mean?
- Yes, I see.

782
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,279
My pals say, 'Look at the conditions,
look at the system, all wrong.'

783
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,739
I agree, the conditions are stinking.
The system's hell.

784
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,825
Yeah, but that still don't
convince me that people

785
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,002
can make anything good together.

786
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,124
It just doesn't seem to happen that way.

787
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,751
I've gone sour.

788
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,709
You talk a lot, don't you?
- Yes, I talk and talk.

789
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,544
What for?
- Because I like it.

790
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,425
And because I'm not sure of myself.

791
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,433
Because I'm always finding things out.

792
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,473
Why are you so disappointed?
What is it you want?

793
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,805
I want children and a garden of my own.

794
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,016
Must they be your own children?
Your own garden?

795
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:42,101
Yes, of course.
What do you think I want?

796
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,232
To work in a day nursery
in a public park?

797
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,735
I want my own children
and my own place.

798
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,074
Yeah, well, that's how it is, you see.

799
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,531
Nearly everybody wants their own.

800
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,117
You see... things have been difficult.

801
00:38:58,211 --> 00:38:59,793
Heh, you say things have been difficult.

802
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,838
My pals say the conditions are terrible.
I say the system's all wrong.

803
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,667
So let's change 'em! Up the revolution!

804
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,594
But nearly everybody still wants
their own this and that.

805
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,138
They still can't make anything
good together.

806
00:39:11,224 --> 00:39:13,637
So what chance have we
with a revolution?

807
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,719
And what chance have we without it?
See what I mean?

808
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,554
Up to a point, yes,
but I've never thought on those lines.

809
00:39:18,648 --> 00:39:22,016
What lines have you thought on?
- Private control of public credit.

810
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,692
And that simply won't do,
we oughtn't to have it.

811
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:27,021
I wouldn't say this to everybody, of course.
- Why not? Say it to everybody!

812
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:29,482
Have it out with your chairman,
Sir Herbert Boogie-Boogie.

813
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:31,863
If I had it out with Sir Herbert,
he'd jolly soon have me out.

814
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:34,912
Well, you're probably be out soon anyway.
Perhaps you're out now.

815
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,411
After all, what are we doing here?
What are we all doing here?

816
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,787
Now you're beginning to talk sense.
That's what I want to know.

817
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,039
That's what's been worrying me.

818
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,997
Everyone's standing around here
chattering and arguing about nothing

819
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,332
when all the time we don't know
where we are or why we're here

820
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:49,169
how we got here,
or how we'll ever get back.

821
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,590
My...

822
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,550
Look!

823
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:33,887
Well, I'm going to have a nice look round.

824
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,102
Well, if you ask me, there's more in Ma
than meets the eye.

825
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:46,475
First in without turning a hair.

826
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,310
Perhaps because she doesn't
talk so much.

827
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,272
I wouldn't be surprised.
- Malcolm! Be careful!

828
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,983
Yes, alright, dear.
I just want to see what happens.

829
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,622
It's alright. There are some steps here

830
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:07,204
that go down to a road
that leads right into the city.

831
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,914
Do you think we should go down?

832
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,874
Well, I don't see why not.

833
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,676
After all, they opened the door

834
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:15,049
as if they expected people
to come in this way.

835
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,756
It all seems a civilised sort of place.

836
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,516
Alright, then.

837
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,027
I'm sure the people will be wonderful, too.

838
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:40,829
Philippa, we don't know what they're like.
They may be awful.

839
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,373
It's open!

840
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,745
Wide open.

841
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,458
Come on, Mother. Let's go.

842
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:51,040
But, Philippa, we don't know
what this place is or who the people are.

843
00:41:51,134 --> 00:41:52,875
They might kill us.
- Why should they?

844
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,926
And, anyway, the people in
Bournemouth were killing me.

845
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:57,881
Well, I think at any rate we ought
to wait for Sir George and Mr Cudworth.

846
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:00,808
Mother, I'm going down there.

847
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,600
If you'll come with me, I'll be glad.

848
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,220
But whether you do or not

849
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,600
I'm going.

850
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,188
Very well, then.

851
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,732
Come on.

852
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,865
I thought you would have been the first in.

853
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,283
Aren't you coming?

854
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,156
I don't know yet. Might.

855
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,487
Might not.

856
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,579
Wonder how long it's been open.
Well, we'd better go down, get in first.

857
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,915
You never know.
- You never know what?

858
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:34,796
Well, you never know!

859
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:36,502
Quite.

860
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,758
Where are the others?
- Gone through. You going?

861
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:42,717
Rather. Ought to be able to get a bath
and some sort of breakfast.

862
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,642
Cudworth, wait for me!

863
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,223
Hello, Joe.

864
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,054
Hello, Alice.

865
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,561
Sorry I told you to shut up, Joe.

866
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,564
That's alright.

867
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,600
I talk too much.

868
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,814
No, I went and lost my temper.

869
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,780
I wouldn't have done if I hadn't thought
I was going to like you.

870
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,157
I'm no treat, you know.

871
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,282
It comes to that, neither am I.

872
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,325
Oh, yes, you are.

873
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,242
I said that to myself the first moment
I set eyes on you

874
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,201
the first time I heard you talking.

875
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,254
'Joe', I said, 'this one's a treat.'

876
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:57,416
I'll bet you didn't.

877
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,876
That's what I said.

878
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,753
And I've been thinking it ever since.

879
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,469
Look.

880
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,147
It's open!
- Yes, it's open.

881
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:17,694
Come on!

882
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,940
Well, what are we waiting for?

883
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,780
Well, I told you before,
I've seen a lot of places.

884
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,112
Well, so have I for that matter.

885
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:27,662
Yeah, but not the way I have.

886
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,990
Sailing in at dawn...
- Oh, yes, and they looked wonderful.

887
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,292
Then when you walked round a bit and
had a couple of beers, it looked terrible.

888
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:34,791
All ribs and running sores. I heard you.

889
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:35,997
Alright, you heard me.

890
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,626
But it isn't going to be like that
down there.

891
00:44:37,717 --> 00:44:39,834
How do you know?
- Because I <i>feel</i> it isn't.

892
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,301
What's the matter with you, Joe?

893
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,007
I'm like you.

894
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,556
I've had a lot of disappointments.

895
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:52,312
I don't want many more.

896
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,977
Come here.

897
00:45:07,038 --> 00:45:08,279
Oh, no, you don't.

898
00:45:09,165 --> 00:45:10,406
What, never?

899
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,035
Never just by grabbing?

900
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:16,249
OK. I'll remember.

901
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,457
But you're coming with me
to look at the city?

902
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:23,002
Yes, I'm coming with you.

903
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,711
Oh, Joe!

904
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:39,985
And there you are

905
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,814
our last two people go down
into the city.

906
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:46,070
We know what kind of people they are

907
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,823
we've seen in what frame of mind
they've gone down

908
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:50,449
and now what?

909
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,155
Well, we ought to look at the city.

910
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:55,038
Oh, no, Jimmy, don't you see?
That's not it at all.

911
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,164
No, I don't see.
- Well...

912
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,422
Well, it's not just a question
of bricks and mortar.

913
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,046
Why, the city may just be
a collection of mud huts

914
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,376
but if it's run right...

915
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,930
Oh, you tell him.
- She's right, you know.

916
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,677
Remember what it all started from.

917
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,508
People's attitude of mind.

918
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,262
It's not a question of wood floors
or rubber floors

919
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:17,848
glass walls or steel walls.

920
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:19,729
We're not town planning now.

921
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,444
It's a question of how people
would react

922
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,238
to something that represented
a new way of life.

923
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,235
That's it!

924
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,154
I see.

925
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:37,164
They had the opportunity of seeing
a city entirely owned and run

926
00:46:37,253 --> 00:46:39,461
by the people who live in it.

927
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:44,258
A place where men and women
don't work for machines and money

928
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:47,836
but machines and money work
for men and women.

929
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,547
Where everybody
has a reasonable chance

930
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,803
but nobody has special privileges.

931
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,226
And what we want to know is
what they'll feel about it

932
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,804
and what they'll do about it.

933
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,104
I get you.

934
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,853
Some would want to stay, others to go.

935
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:05,278
And one or two might want to stay,
and yet might go.

936
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,196
But let's see.
Now, who'll be first out?

937
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,149
Mrs Stritton, I'll bet.

938
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,153
Did you like the city?

939
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,404
No, I couldn't stand the place.

940
00:47:52,495 --> 00:47:55,033
No, I didn't like it either.
- Don't blame you.

941
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,284
Some good-looking girls
down there, though.

942
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,209
Mm-hm.
- Oh, did you think so? I didn't.

943
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:01,785
No, I don't suppose you would.

944
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,745
Have you seen my husband?
- No.

945
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,626
You look as though you'd had
quite enough, Cudworth.

946
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,799
I have, too.
- I'm not surprised.

947
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:10,468
I must say, some of the things
I heard and saw quite shocked me.

948
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,342
I mean, no proper privacy or niceness
or anything.

949
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,515
Didn't you notice that, Mr Cudworth?
- Well, up to a point.

950
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,809
I don't know about niceness.
I'm not sure what niceness is.

951
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,386
Don't care much, anyhow.

952
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,016
What got me down were the people.

953
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:24,191
Bit peculiar, eh?
- Peculiar? Barmy.

954
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:26,643
Why, I said to one chap this morning,
'Wouldn't suit me, this, at all.

955
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,148
Never get any proper work done.'

956
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,446
So he said,
'Oh, what is your work?'

957
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:30,648
So I told him and do you know
what he said?

958
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,607
No idea. I bet it was something
damned insulting.

959
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,034
He said, 'We don't call that work here,
we call it crime.'

960
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,828
He didn't!
- He did.

961
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,497
Then he said if they caught me at it,
I'd be sentenced to a year's road-making.

962
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,290
You see, they're not civilised, Cudworth.

963
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,994
Fellow in that bureau sort of place
said to me, he says

964
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,169
'What can you do?'

965
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:48,670
I said to him, 'Damn it, I used
to do a good deal of hunting.

966
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,751
I still do some shooting and fishing.'

967
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,679
The fellow laughed and said,
'Are you a savage?'

968
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,094
Joe hasn't come up here, has he?

969
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,426
- No.
- Oh, that's alright, then.

970
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,603
I'll go back and find him as soon
as I've had a bit of a rest.

971
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,100
Have you seen my husband?

972
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:06,058
Yes, I passed him on the way.
He was talking to some people back there.

973
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:07,893
Oh, what a day we've had.

974
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:09,398
What a day we've all had.

975
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,234
Why, didn't you like the city?
- Like it?

976
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,781
Like it?

977
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,325
But surely you...
- I hate it.

978
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,663
You don't.
- Of course I do.

979
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,830
I hate it, I hate it!

980
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,079
I wish I'd never set eyes
on the beastly city!

981
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,253
I loathe every bit of it!
I'd like to...

982
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,920
I'd like to burn it down!

983
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,385
I think I could kill you for saying that.

984
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:35,713
And I loathe you, too.

985
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,422
You should've seen yourself,
grinning and screeching

986
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,052
and making a fool of yourself
down there.

987
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,009
I was having the best day of my life.

988
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,929
I was among people who were happy
and I was happy.

989
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,060
I was in a wonderful place at last.

990
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,060
And all you can do is to spit on it.

991
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,362
I could tear it down with my own hands.

992
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:54,940
I'll tell you what's the matter with you.

993
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,284
You're so jealous
you can hardly breathe.

994
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:03,207
You're not only jealous of your husband,
you're jealous of everybody and everything.

995
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:06,251
And you can't enjoy anything
unless you grab it for yourself.

996
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,704
And you can't bear to see anybody else
enjoying themselves.

997
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:11,414
I saw you down there, hating it all,
jealous of it.

998
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,876
Trying to spoil your husband's pleasure.
- Shut up!

999
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,007
Turning everything sour.
- Shut up! Don't!

1000
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:22,092
I'd always hoped in a... silly sort of a way

1001
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,724
to come across something wonderful
just around the corner.

1002
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,981
But I never thought there could be
a place as good as this.

1003
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:32,311
I didn't think people had it in them
to build a city like this.

1004
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:37,070
I didn't think people could work
and play together like these people can.

1005
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,989
I'll do anything for these people.

1006
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,654
I'd die for this place.

1007
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:47,166
Now, look here, young woman...

1008
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,585
I wasn't talking to you.

1009
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,288
I wouldn't know how to talk to you.
I don't know what you mean.

1010
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:54,341
You don't know what I mean?
I speak plain English, don't I?

1011
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,043
When I say I don't know what you mean

1012
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,219
I'm telling you that I can't
make head or tail of you

1013
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,217
so can't talk to you properly.

1014
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,765
To me you're like something stuffed
in a glass case.

1015
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,477
Extremely rude.

1016
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:12,101
I wish I had her under my orders
for a few weeks.

1017
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,436
I daresay you do, Cudworth,
but what are you worrying about?

1018
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:17,864
She didn't tell you that you were stuffed
and in a glass case, did she?

1019
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,739
As a matter of fact, though,
I like a girl with a bit of devil in her.

1020
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,367
But she's... so common.

1021
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,449
What a relief to see civilised people again.

1022
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:29,785
Did you enjoy yourself down there?
- Certainly not.

1023
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,915
I think I care too much for
certain standards.

1024
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,625
I'm used to being treated in...
well, in a certain way, you understand.

1025
00:51:35,718 --> 00:51:38,085
I understand perfectly.
I know exactly what you mean.

1026
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,135
Such rudeness everywhere.
- I quite agree.

1027
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:42,839
Well, I'm going back.
I don't know why I was brought here at all.

1028
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,095
Are you coming, Cudworth?
- You know the way back?

1029
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,553
Yes, they told us down there.
Only sensible thing about the place.

1030
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,014
But they didn't tell me.
- I asked.

1031
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:52,770
I told them it was the only thing
I wanted to know.

1032
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,442
Well, we might all go together.
Mm-hm?

1033
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,895
I must wait for Philippa.
- She'd better hurry.

1034
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,406
What do you mean?

1035
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,279
The sun's setting.

1036
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,323
Well, when it has set,
that door will be shut

1037
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:06,530
and nobody can get in
and nobody can come out.

1038
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,463
Didn't expect to see you come out.
- No, rather not.

1039
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:17,711
Thought that place would be just your style.

1040
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:20,259
It is just my style.

1041
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:22,429
In fact, it's a lot better than my style.

1042
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:26,600
I've seen something today
I never expected to see.

1043
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,768
Something I'd given up all hope of seeing.

1044
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,390
Really? What's that?

1045
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,815
A city full of happy people, healthy people
and busy people.

1046
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:35,517
A really civilised city.

1047
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,395
A real city at last.

1048
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,072
Better not say much more
because none of us here agrees with you.

1049
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:45,827
No, I can believe that.

1050
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:49,615
When I enquired about charities
down there, I was laughed at.

1051
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,040
Why, I can't imagine.

1052
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,493
I've done a great deal of voluntary
charitable work.

1053
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,919
I consider it to be my duty.

1054
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:58,043
That's OK, and I'm not saying
you're hard-hearted.

1055
00:52:58,133 --> 00:53:00,716
But, you see, in this city,
they don't believe in that kind of charity.

1056
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,508
They believe in social justice
and they've got it.

1057
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,590
That's what you people
just don't understand.

1058
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:08,175
You don't even like the look of it.

1059
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:11,557
So long as you're sitting pretty yourselves,
you don't mind being surrounded by people

1060
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,104
who are wondering where
their next meal's coming from

1061
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,307
when the next job will turn up,
how their kids are going to live

1062
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:18,109
how you're going to keep up
your strength to see 'em through.

1063
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,438
What you say to yourselves all the time is,
'Damn you, Jack, I'm alright!'

1064
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,194
Now, wait a minute,
I'm an individualist.

1065
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,445
You're a little pirate and you know it!

1066
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,325
Look here, I've had enough of this.

1067
00:53:29,415 --> 00:53:31,577
I want to get back.
There was no point in coming here anyway.

1068
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,579
What about shoving off, Sir George?
- Yes, good idea.

1069
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,160
Oh, no. Please wait.

1070
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:37,120
Then we can all go back together.

1071
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:39,501
It'd be much safer.
- Safer? There's no danger.

1072
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,332
It's just as safe going back there
as it was coming here.

1073
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:43,089
It won't be, you know.

1074
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,596
Won't be what?

1075
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,391
As safe going back as it was coming.

1076
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,059
Why not?

1077
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:55,430
You wouldn't understand if I told you.

1078
00:53:55,816 --> 00:53:58,024
Are you trying to frighten me?

1079
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,318
Oh, no, you'll be safe enough.

1080
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:01,895
You'd be safer still if you were dead.

1081
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,359
Dead?

1082
00:54:04,825 --> 00:54:08,364
Haven't you ever wished you were
nicely, safely dead, Mrs Stritton?

1083
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,821
Yes... Sometimes I have.

1084
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,619
I thought you had.

1085
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:19,003
Well, haven't you?
- No. Not that way.

1086
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:23,083
Not nicely and safely. Just dead.

1087
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,464
I need to look for my husband.

1088
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,480
Come along, Cudworth, let's get away
from this infernally stupid place.

1089
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:39,057
Just a minute, Sir George.

1090
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,357
I know why Cudworth doesn't like this city,
they wouldn't have him there anyway.

1091
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:45,780
But why don't you like it?
- Hey?

1092
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,402
What's wrong with it
from your point of view?

1093
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,991
Fact is, I can't stand people.

1094
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:56,658
Always enjoyed myself best
where there haven't been people.

1095
00:54:56,752 --> 00:55:00,041
Even when I come to town,
I sit quietly in the club.

1096
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,247
Sensible, old-fashioned club, you know.

1097
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:06,085
Nobody talks, you still get
a decent glass of wine.

1098
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:11,890
But no people. I can't stand people.

1099
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:20,857
Yes, I see.

1100
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:25,486
Well, come along, Cudworth.

1101
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:26,983
Sure you won't join us, Lady Loxfield?

1102
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,565
No, I must wait for Philippa.
- Quite.

1103
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:31,072
Well, get her away from here.
- Quite agree.

1104
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:33,528
That's right, you know.

1105
00:55:33,622 --> 00:55:39,789
I don't mind a few old pals, decent fellows,
and one or two reliable servants

1106
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:43,167
that sort of thing,
but not mobs of people.

1107
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,546
It's getting darker.

1108
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,173
Yes.

1109
00:56:12,411 --> 00:56:14,368
Mother...
- Philippa dear!

1110
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,330
I'm so glad you've come.

1111
00:56:17,416 --> 00:56:19,408
The others have gone, but if we hurry
we can catch them up.

1112
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,788
So much better if we all go together.
Come along.

1113
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:23,620
Mother, I'm not coming back.

1114
00:56:25,257 --> 00:56:26,589
Don't be absurd, darling.

1115
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:29,167
I'm not coming back, I'm staying here.

1116
00:56:29,261 --> 00:56:32,049
But it's quite impossible.
Nothing would induce me to remain here.

1117
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,052
I'm not talking about you, Mother,
I'm talking about me.

1118
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,387
You're tired, darling.

1119
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,847
I'm not tired and I'm not absurd!
- Philippa!

1120
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:45,809
I'm not any of things you've been
telling me I was for years and years!

1121
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:49,233
Every time I tried to find some life
of my own.

1122
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,316
You're talking to your own mother now,
Philippa, not to a stranger.

1123
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,818
No need to glare and shout.

1124
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,622
I'm sorry, Mother. I didn't mean to.

1125
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,542
But I can't go back with you.
I'd rather die.

1126
00:57:03,462 --> 00:57:05,749
Going back there would only be
a kind of slow death.

1127
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,124
Philippa, I'm getting old.

1128
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,799
I've lost your father,
I've lost the life we had together.

1129
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:16,552
But I try to keep what's left.

1130
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:18,554
But there isn't anything left.

1131
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,101
Not even for you, there isn't.

1132
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:22,975
For me, it's not living at all.

1133
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:41,327
Look, Mother. That lovely city.

1134
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:44,124
Now that I've seen it,
being among those people down there

1135
00:57:44,211 --> 00:57:45,452
I just couldn't go back.

1136
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:48,163
Oh, Mother, can't you understand?

1137
00:57:49,925 --> 00:57:52,759
All I understand, Philippa,
is that you're my only child.

1138
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,253
That I have nothing left now but you.

1139
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:58,010
And that you must have some
sense of duty towards me.

1140
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,013
That's just it, I have a sense of duty.

1141
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:03,060
I want you to come with me into the city.

1142
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,184
For your own sake as well as mine.
I know you'd be happy there.

1143
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:08,982
I know I shouldn't.
- Oh, Mother.

1144
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,106
I don't want to leave.

1145
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,814
I hate to think of you going
back there alone.

1146
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,239
I'm glad of it.

1147
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,614
And remember, darling, I'm your mother.

1148
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:21,242
I brought you into the world,
I've loved you, I've looked after you.

1149
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:25,117
Mother... Look...

1150
00:58:43,145 --> 00:58:44,306
No, Philippa.

1151
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:48,515
I'm too old to change.

1152
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:53,106
Goodbye, Mother.
- Don't go, darling!

1153
00:58:54,156 --> 00:58:55,317
Goodbye, Mother.

1154
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,575
Philippa, you can't leave me!
You won't leave me, darling!

1155
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:03,871
I must, Mother.

1156
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,162
Goodbye.

1157
00:59:42,454 --> 00:59:45,162
Mrs Stritton, this is serious.
- What is?

1158
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:47,035
Are you going to give that chap
of yours a break?

1159
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,617
I don't know what you mean.
- You don't know what I mean.

1160
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:51,247
And you don't know
what he means either.

1161
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,874
Stonewalling, eh?

1162
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:56,298
Well, you'll win.
Stonewalling always wins.

1163
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,626
Except, of course, that it always loses.

1164
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:01,633
'Cause that's all you're left with
in the end, stone walls.

1165
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,089
You wouldn't know what
I was talking about, would you?

1166
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,049
No, I haven't the slightest idea.
Something silly.

1167
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,384
To sum up, you'll pick up
any bit of happiness

1168
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,140
as though it was a chicken
and then wring its neck!

1169
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,437
Why do you keep on insulting me?

1170
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:10,980
Because I'm trying to save your life!

1171
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:14,184
Well, my life isn't in danger!
- You've got a knife in its throat now!

1172
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,518
Don't be so beastly!

1173
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,649
Anyway, what's it to do with you?
You don't even like me.

1174
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,653
No, but I like life and don't want to see it
poured down the drain like dirty water.

1175
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,793
Ma, I thought some of these others
would want to go back, but not you.

1176
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:38,044
I'm disappointed in you.
I thought better of you.

1177
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,127
Now what are you talking about, eh?

1178
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,882
I'm talking about you, Ma.

1179
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,554
I thought you at least would want
to stay down there

1180
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,131
and not come creeping back.

1181
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,683
You do like to hear yourself talk,
don't you?

1182
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,227
Don't take any notice of him, Mrs Batley.
- I don't.

1183
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,976
Have you seen my husband?
- No, Mrs Stritton.

1184
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,648
Did they tell you the way to go back?

1185
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,147
No, I never asked 'em.

1186
01:00:57,237 --> 01:00:59,069
You see, I ain't going that way.

1187
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:01,569
I'm stopping here.
- That's the girl.

1188
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,524
I only come back to get me basket.

1189
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,029
I might as well have it.

1190
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,662
But I'm surprised at you, Mrs Batley.
- How's that?

1191
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,705
Well, I thought you said
you had a lot of responsibilities.

1192
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,409
Looking after people, taking care
of a home, going out cleaning.

1193
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,462
That's it. Had years and years of it.

1194
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:19,211
Could have done with half a dozen
pairs of hands sometimes.

1195
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,338
Well, you can't leave it all to stay here.

1196
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,636
Can't I? Who says I can't?

1197
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:25,713
So long as I can remember

1198
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,800
they've been telling me what I can do
and what I can't do.

1199
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:32,103
And no thanks for it, neither,
when I did what I could do.

1200
01:01:32,189 --> 01:01:36,729
Well, some of 'em can look
after themselves now for a change.

1201
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:37,979
It'll do 'em good.

1202
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,357
You like it here, don't you, Ma?

1203
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:46,992
When I first saw them children
comin' out of them fine houses

1204
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:50,242
and all their mothers lookin'
so nice and smilin'

1205
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:53,746
and everything so clean and pretty
I could've cried.

1206
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,163
I fancy I dreamt about it once
when I was a girl.

1207
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,832
And all them bright streets.

1208
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:03,919
And the gardens,
and the children's faces.

1209
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,759
I remember being quite upset at the time

1210
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:10,262
thinking it was nothing but a dream

1211
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:13,140
just tormenting myself
as you might say.

1212
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,811
But it ain't.

1213
01:02:15,649 --> 01:02:16,856
It's real.

1214
01:02:17,901 --> 01:02:19,187
It's here.

1215
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,574
Behave yourself, young man.

1216
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,748
Well, I suppose you're delighted.

1217
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:37,126
Yes, I'm delighted.

1218
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:38,498
Dorothy!

1219
01:02:38,964 --> 01:02:40,455
Are you going to give him a break?

1220
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,834
I don't know what you mean.

1221
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,418
I hope by the time I get back
you'll have got rid of the body.

1222
01:02:46,388 --> 01:02:48,380
They say that's the most difficult part.

1223
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,221
Dorothy, where have you been?

1224
01:02:53,311 --> 01:02:55,348
I've been here waiting for you.
- I wish you'd stayed on.

1225
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,225
I want to get away from here.
I want to home.

1226
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:58,772
But why should we go?

1227
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,724
You know, if you'd only stayed on
a little and seen...

1228
01:03:00,819 --> 01:03:03,061
I saw all I wanted to see
and I told you what I thought about it.

1229
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,270
Yes, but, my dear...

1230
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,447
I tell you I hate it, I hate it, I loathe it.

1231
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:10,568
But why, Dorothy? Why do you?

1232
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:13,450
It's silly, it's common.
- Common?

1233
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,453
It seems to me very uncommon.
- Oh, you know what I mean, Malcolm.

1234
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:18,250
And everyone looking so pleased
with themselves.

1235
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,293
Well, why shouldn't they look pleased
with themselves?

1236
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:21,666
They've something to look pleased about.

1237
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,713
I was asking one chap...
- Oh, don't go on and on about them!

1238
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,713
I saw what they were like!
I've got eyes and ears as well as you!

1239
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:29,803
Not when you don't want to,
you haven't.

1240
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,048
What does that mean?

1241
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,724
I means that you made up your mind

1242
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,551
you wouldn't like this city
and all the people in it.

1243
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,806
I don't know why.

1244
01:03:36,896 --> 01:03:39,229
It was as strange to me at first
as it was to you

1245
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:41,478
but I wanted to find out about it
and you didn't.

1246
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:43,400
You'd made up your mind.
- Well...

1247
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,523
And now you're ready to make up
my mind for me.

1248
01:03:45,613 --> 01:03:47,275
You want to make me dislike it, too.

1249
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,698
And you can't do that, Dorothy.
Do you see? I won't have it.

1250
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,411
You'd do anything rather than
ever admit that you were wrong

1251
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,203
or try to change yourself

1252
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,078
or open your heart and mind
and be generous.

1253
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:02,169
You hate me now, don't you, Malcolm?

1254
01:04:07,052 --> 01:04:09,840
No, I don't. But I easily could.

1255
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,718
You've done this before,
but this is the worst.

1256
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:15,891
And I won't be bullied and cheated
out of what I think and feel.

1257
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,385
I like that place and those people.

1258
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,346
It's a much better place
than we've ever known before

1259
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,102
and they're much better people.

1260
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,524
They're alive.

1261
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,939
They're doing the things
I've always wanted people to do.

1262
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:31,111
I'm going to help them.
- Malcolm!

1263
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:33,867
Malcolm!

1264
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:37,200
Malcolm!

1265
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:39,706
Malcolm, don't leave me!

1266
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,125
Malcolm!

1267
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,602
Alright, Dorothy. Don't cry.

1268
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,604
Malcolm! Oh, Malcolm!

1269
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,230
Alright, Dorothy.

1270
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:11,564
Malcolm, you were going to leave me!

1271
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:14,275
Well, I haven't left you. I'm here.

1272
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:17,658
You don't love me.
- Yes, I do.

1273
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:21,082
Oh, I know I'm silly
and sometimes I behave stupidly

1274
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,284
but somehow I can't help it!

1275
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,707
Sometimes I hate myself!

1276
01:05:25,797 --> 01:05:27,663
Sometimes I wish I were dead!

1277
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:31,508
That man Joe Dinmore said that.

1278
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,630
Somehow he knew.

1279
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:36,680
He said, 'Haven't you ever wished
you were nicely, safely dead, Mrs Stritton?'

1280
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,142
I don't see how he could know that,
especially about me

1281
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:42,345
but somehow he did.

1282
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,606
I don't think I'm going to like it
when we get back.

1283
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:50,653
Malcolm!
You are coming back with me?

1284
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:53,230
Yes, I'm coming back with you.

1285
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:57,780
You know the way back?

1286
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,029
Yes, I know the way back.

1287
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:02,080
Oh, darling, you are good to me.

1288
01:06:02,167 --> 01:06:03,453
You'll forget all this.

1289
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,455
I'll do everything I can
to make it better.

1290
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,834
We'll... we'll try and meet more people,
the sort of people you like.

1291
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,585
I'll make friends.

1292
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:13,258
No, I know I don't find it easy,
but I will, I'll make friends.

1293
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:17,258
It'll all be different, you'll see.
You'll see!

1294
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:20,011
Timed it alright, haven't I?
- Yes.

1295
01:06:20,101 --> 01:06:21,308
Come along, Malcolm.

1296
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,512
Well, I knew it'd happen,
but I'm sorry.

1297
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:26,393
Thank you. Goodbye.

1298
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:27,849
You may see me again.

1299
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:32,061
It'd be alright if I do,
but I don't think that's likely.

1300
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,236
You never know.

1301
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,482
I might remind then of what
you've seen and heard today.

1302
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,613
Don't go dead and cold on it.
Keep it warm and alive inside, pal.

1303
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:44,330
All the best.

1304
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,624
Malcolm.

1305
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:51,547
And all the best to you, too. Pal.

1306
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,181
Malcolm, perhaps
you could leave the bank altogether.

1307
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,424
I'm sure Mr Cudworth
would give you a job.

1308
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:03,475
I don't want to work for him.

1309
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,052
- Oh, but Malcolm...
- Drop it, Dorothy.

1310
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:08,730
- I'm coming back. That's enough.
- Yes, Malcolm.

1311
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,398
Well, Alice, you made it!
- Oh, I could kill you!

1312
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,725
What for?
- For making me come out.

1313
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,809
Well, why did you?

1314
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:54,859
Because I'm a woman
and a damned fool!

1315
01:07:54,946 --> 01:07:56,153
Go on!

1316
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:57,738
I don't go on from there.

1317
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:01,192
I've said enough. Too much.

1318
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:06,034
You liked it down there.
- You know I did.

1319
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:08,537
It's good, isn't it?
- It's what I've always hoped for.

1320
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,743
What I've always believed was
somewhere round the corner

1321
01:08:10,837 --> 01:08:11,918
if we could only find it.

1322
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:13,667
And there it is!

1323
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:17,045
I've always hoped that men and women
could live like that if they tried.

1324
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,218
Life hadn't got to be a dog fight
round a dustbin.

1325
01:08:19,304 --> 01:08:21,546
We made it like that
but it needn't be like that.

1326
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,050
No, it needn't be like that.

1327
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:25,758
Here they don't work to keep themselves
out of the gutter.

1328
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:29,186
They work 'cause they've got
something big and exciting to do.

1329
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:31,389
They can see their life growing.

1330
01:08:31,482 --> 01:08:33,815
They're building it up
and they're enjoying it all.

1331
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,727
You told us this morning
before we went down there

1332
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:40,064
that you didn't believe in this and that.
- I know. I take it all back.

1333
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:42,984
I've seen it for myself.
- Those kids.

1334
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,111
Do you remember, Joe?

1335
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:50,036
I shan't ever forget it, not for a
single minute, as long as I live, Alice.

1336
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,495
I'm going to sit down.
My knees are going.

1337
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:59,883
Go on, Alice.
- Go on?

1338
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:04,217
I've said enough.
It's about time you started talking.

1339
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:05,388
Not yet.

1340
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:07,883
You've got to tell me.

1341
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,014
You make it hard for a girl,
I must say, Joe.

1342
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:13,313
I've taken the hard road, too.
You'll see.

1343
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:18,398
Before that door opened,
when we were all up here talking

1344
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,567
I liked you a lot, Joe.

1345
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:23,615
Only I wished you believed in something.

1346
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:28,658
Then, when we went down there
and saw what it was like

1347
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:30,455
you were different.

1348
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,658
You were what I wanted you to be.

1349
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:35,039
You were so eager and so happy.

1350
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,246
You believed everything
you saw and heard.

1351
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:41,050
That's true, isn't it?
- That's true, Alice.

1352
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:43,297
So then I knew I loved you, Joe.

1353
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:46,388
I hoped you loved me.

1354
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:49,433
You looked as if you did.

1355
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,305
I did.

1356
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,478
I still do.

1357
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:55,556
Are you sure?

1358
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,062
Certain.

1359
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:00,940
Oh, that's alright.

1360
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:17,043
I wasn't worried until it began to get late

1361
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,419
and then I started looking for you
and asking about you.

1362
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:21,999
Nobody seemed to know.

1363
01:10:22,093 --> 01:10:24,050
Until I met Mrs Batley.

1364
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:26,845
She said you were up here.
Waiting for me, she said.

1365
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,348
So I ran and ran.
I was blazing wild, you heard me.

1366
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:34,057
But I had to come out
if you'd come out, Joe.

1367
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,480
It wouldn't have been at all the same
without you.

1368
01:10:37,358 --> 01:10:38,849
I had to be with you, Joe.

1369
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:40,897
That's what I hoped.

1370
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:43,816
That's why I waited and waited.
- But why?

1371
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:46,319
I daren't go back
once I made up my mind to come out.

1372
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:49,742
You see, I felt if I went back,
you'd persuade me to stay.

1373
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:52,037
Or even if you didn't, I'd never have
guts enough to come out again.

1374
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:54,866
But what's the matter with you?
Why shouldn't we stay?

1375
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,997
For God's sake, don't tell me
that this isn't what you wanted either.

1376
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:00,170
Don't you see
somebody's got to go back?

1377
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:01,337
No, I don't see.

1378
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,631
Some of them have gone back,
haven't they?

1379
01:11:02,717 --> 01:11:04,049
Yes, some of them have gone back.

1380
01:11:04,135 --> 01:11:06,343
And what good will it do anyone
that they have?

1381
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:10,048
If ever they say a word about this place
they'll swear blind it's terrible

1382
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:12,724
so somebody's got to go back
and tell the truth about it.

1383
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:17,521
Yes. And that's got to be the bloke
that I go and fall for and tack myself onto.

1384
01:11:17,607 --> 01:11:19,018
It'd just have to be, wouldn't it?

1385
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,441
Yes, it must be,
that's just what it must be.

1386
01:11:22,195 --> 01:11:24,403
You wouldn't want a chap
who could keep this to himself.

1387
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:27,606
I see.

1388
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,987
I've got to tell 'em!
I've got to go on telling 'em!

1389
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:32,034
Day and night, wherever I am!
- Wherever we are.

1390
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,407
Wherever we are, I've got to tell 'em!

1391
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:34,784
We've go to tell 'em, Joe!

1392
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,283
But how do we get back?

1393
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,497
Well, how did we come here?

1394
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:44,335
Some kind of... miracle got us here.

1395
01:11:45,927 --> 01:11:47,793
If we're ready to go,
it'll get us back.

1396
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,297
It's not going to be easy, you know,
Alice, when we are back.

1397
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,801
It'll be a hard road.

1398
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:57,186
Some of 'em will laugh and jeer,
just 'cause they don't want to understand.

1399
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:59,638
They'll be frightened of losing
some miserable little advantage

1400
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,689
they've schemed and worked for.

1401
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:04,359
They won't want to lose the whip hand
they've got over somebody.

1402
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,108
They'd rather have their little
privilege and prestige in an ashpit

1403
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,657
than take a chance and share alike
in a new world.

1404
01:12:11,786 --> 01:12:13,948
Some of 'em, poor devils

1405
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,448
are so twisted and tormented
inside themselves

1406
01:12:17,542 --> 01:12:20,910
that they envy and hate
other people's happiness.

1407
01:12:22,964 --> 01:12:24,830
We'll have to talk to plenty of 'em.

1408
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:29,797
It's going to be tough.

1409
01:12:31,931 --> 01:12:33,297
You don't know the half of it.

1410
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:37,851
Then there are all the smart boys,
the kind I was

1411
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:40,520
who've had to take plenty
and know it's all rotten

1412
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:42,313
and won't have it that you can see it
getting any better.

1413
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,567
They get big laughs at your expense.

1414
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:48,020
I know, I've been one of them.

1415
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:50,898
And there are plenty of them, too.

1416
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,617
And that's not all either, Alice.

1417
01:12:56,038 --> 01:13:01,033
There will be days, dark days, rainy days

1418
01:13:01,961 --> 01:13:03,623
when nobody wants to listen.

1419
01:13:05,423 --> 01:13:08,416
When the butcher hasn't been paid
and the grocer looks at you sideways

1420
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,045
and you've nothing to smoke.

1421
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,922
And they're asking you
when you're moving on to the next town.

1422
01:13:17,143 --> 01:13:18,429
And then we...

1423
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,097
we shan't be sure ourselves
that we were ever here.

1424
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:27,685
Joe.

1425
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,065
The light's going.

1426
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:33,815
We must have one last look.

1427
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,835
Must we go, Joe?

1428
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:49,960
Can't we stay?

1429
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,843
You could. I must go.

1430
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:56,422
You're not going without me.
- Then you can't stay.

1431
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,885
I don't want to go back, Joe!
- Take it easy, kid.

1432
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,804
It'll seem so much worse
when we get back!

1433
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:06,139
No, it won't.

1434
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:09,817
Because, to begin with,
we'll remember.

1435
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,645
That's why we've got to back

1436
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:14,402
'cause we're the ones who've been
and seen it all.

1437
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,109
And then we'll hope.

1438
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,824
And we'll keep on hoping.

1439
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:23,032
And every time we see a spark of vision
or hope in anybody

1440
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,162
we'll blow it into a blaze.

1441
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:28,662
They'll tell us we can't change
human nature.

1442
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,753
That's the oldest excuse in the world
for doing nothing

1443
01:14:31,842 --> 01:14:33,253
and it isn't true.

1444
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,961
We've been changing human nature
for thousands of years.

1445
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,548
But what you can't change in it, Alice

1446
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,476
is man's eternal desire
and vision and hope

1447
01:14:42,561 --> 01:14:44,427
of making the world a better place
to live in.

1448
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:47,055
Wherever you go now

1449
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:52,068
up and down across the seven seas
from Poplar to Chungking

1450
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,735
you can see that desire
and vision and hope

1451
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,117
bigger and stronger than ever before

1452
01:14:59,203 --> 01:15:03,197
beginning to light up men's faces,
bringing a lift to their voices.

1453
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:06,241
Not every man or every woman
wants to...

1454
01:15:07,253 --> 01:15:11,293
to cry out for it,
to work for it, to live for it...

1455
01:15:12,425 --> 01:15:14,041
if necessary, to die for it.

1456
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,590
But there's one here and one there.

1457
01:15:18,597 --> 01:15:21,010
There's a few down this street,
a few down that street.

1458
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,343
Until you begin to see there
are millions of us.

1459
01:15:25,855 --> 01:15:27,266
Armies and armies of us.

1460
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:31,771
Enough to build 10,000 new cities.

1461
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:35,983
Like our city?

1462
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:39,904
Yes, like our city.

1463
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:54,797
Goodbye, my lovely city.

1464
01:15:58,054 --> 01:16:00,046
I don't know when I'll ever
see you again.

1465
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,227
Come on, Joe.

1466
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,356
Let's get going.

1467
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:41,678
There you are.
That's how it is, you see.

1468
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,302
Some like it, some won't.

1469
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,844
And some are ready to go out
and fight for it.

1470
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:51,055
Yes, you might hear them one night
at a street corner.

1471
01:16:52,399 --> 01:16:54,015
I'll listen when I do.

1472
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,104
Oh, Jimmy.

1473
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,232
I believe we've convinced him.

1474
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,982
Well, I must be on my way.

1475
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,651
Good luck, and thanks for listening.

1476
01:17:04,745 --> 01:17:05,986
Goodbye.

1477
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,203
<i>' I dream'd in a dream</i>

1478
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:16,288
<i>I saw a city invincible to the attacks
of the whole of the rest of the earth.</i>

1479
01:17:17,424 --> 01:17:20,542
<i>I dream'd that was the new
City of Friends. '</i>
