1
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:50,406
- Yes, yes, this is Gwen Pluth.

2
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:51,239
Right.

3
00:00:54,955 --> 00:00:58,446
Right, well, my doctor hasn't gotten paid.

4
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:00,486
We met the deductible, yes.

5
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:03,069
I've called four times on this.

6
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:10,803
Okay, okay.

7
00:01:17,486 --> 00:01:18,319
Alright.

8
00:01:31,715 --> 00:01:32,548
Thank you.

9
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,845
No, no, no, no, no.

10
00:01:48,845 --> 00:01:49,678
Autumn.

11
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,996
- Jen, back to earth.

12
00:01:56,643 --> 00:01:57,476
- Sorry.

13
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:03,944
Stop, you can't look!

14
00:02:03,944 --> 00:02:05,675
- Yes, I can.

15
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:07,777
- It's not fair, you can't look.

16
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,459
- Yes, I can, there is no rule against it.

17
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:10,686
- Todd!

18
00:02:10,686 --> 00:02:11,897
- You can't cover my eyes.

19
00:02:11,897 --> 00:02:15,314
- Yes, I can, there's no rule against it.

20
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:28,157
I can't concentrate.

21
00:02:28,157 --> 00:02:29,717
- Tough decision?

22
00:02:31,896 --> 00:02:33,877
You're not getting out
of this one that easy.

23
00:02:33,877 --> 00:02:35,016
- What are you talking about?

24
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:36,016
I'm winning.

25
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,798
Hello, this is Jenny.

26
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:43,689
Uh huh.

27
00:02:47,896 --> 00:02:52,063
Yeah, okay, I can be there
in 15 minutes, no problem.

28
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:56,183
I gotta go.
- Seriously?

29
00:02:57,334 --> 00:03:00,167
- Yeah, hopefully I won't be long.

30
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:06,449
Hey, no peeking.

31
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:44,135
Hey, how are you?

32
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,550
- Is she in any pain?

33
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:03,254
I didn't know what to do.

34
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:07,689
Please, do something for her.

35
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:17,952
- I don't think she's
in any physical pain,

36
00:04:17,952 --> 00:04:21,600
but I need you to stay calm,
she's very anxious right now.

37
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,767
Can you get the box of medicine
from the fridge for me?

38
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:29,880
Hey, it's okay Cynthia.

39
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,213
Hey, it's Jenny, your nurse.

40
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,792
I need you to breathe with me, okay?

41
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:37,625
Good.

42
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:46,131
- And what if this doesn't work?

43
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,679
- We're gonna take this
one step at a time.

44
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:50,096
I need you to trust me, okay?

45
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:54,760
Hey, Cynthia, we're
gonna get through this.

46
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,491
I'm giving her lorazepam, this
is going to help calm her.

47
00:04:58,491 --> 00:04:59,324
Open.

48
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:11,771
God, give me the strength
to help calm her.

49
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:13,188
Good, good, good.

50
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:17,786
Good, good, good.

51
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,564
Can I pray for you?

52
00:05:33,832 --> 00:05:37,589
Heavenly Father, I pray
for peace and comfort

53
00:05:37,589 --> 00:05:39,422
for Cynthia right now.

54
00:05:41,131 --> 00:05:43,860
Lord, we know her discomfort
is only temporary,

55
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,610
if she trusts in you.

56
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,541
I pray she would feel your presence

57
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:52,458
and an overwhelming sense of peace.

58
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:55,656
In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

59
00:06:17,643 --> 00:06:19,083
- So how was work?

60
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:20,832
- It's going really well.

61
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,773
- Oh my goodness, I
don't know how you do it.

62
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,460
- Well, she was born to do it.

63
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,272
- It takes someone
special to do what you do.

64
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:28,003
- I just tell people
it's like being a labor

65
00:06:28,003 --> 00:06:31,352
and delivery nurse, just
delivering to the next life.

66
00:06:33,181 --> 00:06:37,773
It's my mom again, I'd
better get this, excuse me.

67
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:38,606
Hey, mom.

68
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:42,755
What?

69
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:46,232
Is dad okay?

70
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,785
Okay.

71
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:53,965
Mm hmm.

72
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:56,225
Yeah.

73
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,693
- What happened?

74
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:10,781
- I can't stop thinking about

75
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,948
where my dad is right now.

76
00:07:15,632 --> 00:07:18,799
- We don't know what was in his heart.

77
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:26,689
- Why does God place such a burden on us?

78
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:35,352
- Uncle Ed, you are looking
like a million bucks.

79
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:36,352
After taxes.

80
00:07:37,472 --> 00:07:38,472
- Funny guy.

81
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:41,237
How's work?

82
00:07:41,237 --> 00:07:42,680
- Good, keeping busy.

83
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,763
- Good, good.

84
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:50,091
They did a good job with
his makeup, didn't they?

85
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,674
He looked peaceful.

86
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:54,850
- I sure hope he is.

87
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,600
Excuse me, I need some fresh air.

88
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,141
- Speak of the devil.

89
00:08:03,141 --> 00:08:04,832
- Autumn!
- Hey.

90
00:08:04,832 --> 00:08:06,999
- What are you doing here?

91
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,880
- Hey.

92
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,211
- I ran into her mom
the other day at the store.

93
00:08:12,211 --> 00:08:15,118
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you.

94
00:08:15,118 --> 00:08:18,030
- Are you back in town for a while?

95
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,947
- Yeah, um,

96
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,632
I am so sorry for your loss.

97
00:08:23,632 --> 00:08:24,465
- Thanks.

98
00:08:26,289 --> 00:08:28,400
Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

99
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,811
- When was the last time
you two saw each other?

100
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,811
- It's been,

101
00:08:34,537 --> 00:08:35,787
a while.
- Yeah.

102
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,297
- Well, come on in, we got plenty of food.

103
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:44,964
- Uh mom, can you give us a sec?

104
00:08:45,869 --> 00:08:48,786
- Oh, okay, it was good seeing you.

105
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:51,241
- You too, Gwen.

106
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,956
- It's so good to see you.

107
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,548
I tried calling a few times.

108
00:09:11,548 --> 00:09:13,909
- I know.
- Why didn't you--

109
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:15,159
- I'm sorry, I,

110
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:22,652
things have just been a little,

111
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,163
crazy lately.

112
00:09:34,869 --> 00:09:36,119
So, how's Todd?

113
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:38,787
- He's good.

114
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,491
Work's been a little slow.

115
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:44,479
He stays busy though, he just finished

116
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:47,549
a big project at church, so.

117
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:50,848
- Still doing the church thing, huh?

118
00:09:50,848 --> 00:09:51,681
- Yeah.

119
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,050
- Um, I know you guys were trying

120
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,460
last time we talked, any luck?

121
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,007
- No, not yet.

122
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,460
Hopefully soon, though.
- Yeah.

123
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:13,671
- How about you, are you seeing anyone?

124
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:16,164
- No, no.

125
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,777
- Enjoy being single, you've got time.

126
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:28,567
Are you okay?

127
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:31,234
- Yeah, no, I'm, I'm good, fine.

128
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:35,420
I actually have to get going.

129
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,370
- You just got here, come in for a bit.

130
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,370
- I can't, I'm sorry, I,

131
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,849
I have some stuff I gotta take care of.

132
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:50,639
- There you are.

133
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,341
- Todd, look who's here.

134
00:10:53,341 --> 00:10:55,568
- Autumn, hi, good to see you.

135
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:58,730
- Yeah, good to see you too, um, so sorry,

136
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,897
I gotta run, but it was
really good to see you guys.

137
00:11:08,477 --> 00:11:09,977
- Everything okay?

138
00:11:11,669 --> 00:11:13,086
- Yeah, not sure.

139
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,769
- Your mom's looking for you, we're ready.

140
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:32,620
- Thank you, everyone, for coming.

141
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,499
Jenny's going to say grace.

142
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:37,916
She's the designated saint in the family.

143
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:42,131
- Heavenly Father,

144
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,802
Lord, we thank you for this time we have

145
00:11:45,802 --> 00:11:47,802
to celebrate dad's life.

146
00:11:49,121 --> 00:11:50,788
We miss him so much.

147
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:58,962
We thank you for the time
you gave us with him.

148
00:11:58,962 --> 00:12:03,762
I pray for your peace and
comfort on this sad day.

149
00:12:03,762 --> 00:12:06,095
In Jesus' name I pray, amen.

150
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:08,252
- Amen.

151
00:12:17,562 --> 00:12:19,954
- He's in a better place now.

152
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:20,787
- Is he?

153
00:12:22,382 --> 00:12:24,630
Based on what, mom?

154
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,171
- Forget it, this isn't the time or place.

155
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:29,670
- Dad's memorial service
isn't the time or place

156
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,931
to grieve for him or
consider where he went?

157
00:12:32,931 --> 00:12:34,040
- Jen!

158
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,060
- We're here to pay
respect to your father.

159
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,742
This isn't about your religion.

160
00:12:38,742 --> 00:12:41,320
- I'm sick of pretending
everything's okay.

161
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,131
What if he's not in a better place?

162
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:44,464
- That's enough!

163
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,070
- Jenny, where are you going?

164
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,570
- I can't do this.

165
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,683
- Babe, come on.

166
00:13:07,141 --> 00:13:09,350
You're upset, you both said
things you didn't mean.

167
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:12,050
- I'm not going back in there.

168
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,142
- Give her a minute to cool down.

169
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:16,169
- Please give me the keys.

170
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:18,302
- You're upset, you shouldn't be driving.

171
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:22,052
- I'm fine, I just need
to take a walk, okay?

172
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,662
I want to start planning for a family.

173
00:13:34,662 --> 00:13:36,982
- We are a family.

174
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,899
- You know what I mean.

175
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,260
I want kids, Todd.

176
00:13:42,548 --> 00:13:44,891
I don't think I can wait any longer.

177
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,470
I really think we should adopt.

178
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,000
- I want to adopt too, but
it's not the right time.

179
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,302
How are we gonna afford it?

180
00:13:53,302 --> 00:13:55,131
We can barely get by as it is.

181
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:58,102
- Well, we're not getting any younger.

182
00:13:58,102 --> 00:13:59,270
- I don't want our kids growing up

183
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,582
in the same environment like I did.

184
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:04,182
I want to be financially stable first.

185
00:14:04,182 --> 00:14:06,099
- When's that gonna be?

186
00:14:08,102 --> 00:14:11,200
- I'm doing the best I can, you know.

187
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,033
- I know.

188
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:18,207
What if I get that promotion?

189
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,550
Can we then?

190
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,440
- We'll see, we have to
run the numbers first.

191
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,273
- I already did, do you wanna see?

192
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,410
I created a detailed budget based off

193
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:40,062
of my potential raise, my Christmas bonus,

194
00:14:40,062 --> 00:14:43,851
our tax return, and the money
that we have in savings.

195
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:46,582
And there's some really great grants

196
00:14:46,582 --> 00:14:49,415
that I think we could qualify for.

197
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:59,389
- I mean, it could work,
if the numbers are right.

198
00:15:11,382 --> 00:15:13,840
- Hey, Jenny, how was your weekend?

199
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,502
Mine was terrible, Mrs.
Epstein's daughter had me there

200
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:20,931
until three in the morning, on a Saturday!

201
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:23,131
That woman is driving me nuts.

202
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,989
Everything's an emergency with her.

203
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,662
And on top that, I only
got two hours of sleep.

204
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:30,870
My husband snores like a bear.

205
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,390
I keep telling him, "You
need to get a CPAP."

206
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,950
But does he listen to me?

207
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,617
Typical guy for you though, huh?

208
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,913
Adoption?

209
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,679
What, you can't get pregnant?

210
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,809
- It's none of your business.

211
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,960
Please don't take things off my desk.

212
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,112
- Well, it ain't cheap to adopt, you know?

213
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:52,695
- I know, that's why
I need this promotion.

214
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:55,552
- What promotion?

215
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:58,635
- I'm sorry, Barbara's waiting on me.

216
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:02,648
- Okay, um,

217
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,014
uh huh, sure.

218
00:16:06,751 --> 00:16:08,918
Uh huh, three weeks, okay.

219
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,140
Uh huh, got it.

220
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:16,711
If you get the information,
I can take care of it

221
00:16:16,711 --> 00:16:18,461
by next week, thanks.

222
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:28,592
Hey, how was your dad's service?

223
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:31,675
- Uh, okay, I had some family issues.

224
00:16:33,112 --> 00:16:34,942
- I'm sorry to hear it.

225
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,552
You could have taken more
time off, if you wanted.

226
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:40,040
- No, I'd be thinking about it all day.

227
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,272
Maybe it's better I'm
at work keeping busy.

228
00:16:42,272 --> 00:16:46,439
- I understand, denial is
part of the grieving process.

229
00:16:48,752 --> 00:16:49,835
So what's up?

230
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,474
- I was wondering if you've
given any more thought

231
00:16:53,474 --> 00:16:55,392
to that promotion.

232
00:16:55,392 --> 00:16:57,818
- Corporate wants me to
interview a few more people

233
00:16:57,818 --> 00:17:00,110
before I make my decision.

234
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:04,286
Standard procedure,
it's a formality really.

235
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:05,886
You'd be a perfect fit for it.

236
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:08,256
- That's great, because I really feel

237
00:17:08,256 --> 00:17:10,435
like I would excel at this position.

238
00:17:10,435 --> 00:17:12,575
I have ideas on how to
improve our patient care

239
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:15,926
and tighten up compliance with the regs.

240
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:18,444
- Okay, good, I'm hoping
to make my decision

241
00:17:18,444 --> 00:17:20,896
in a couple weeks and I'll let you know.

242
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:21,729
- Thanks.

243
00:17:25,766 --> 00:17:27,486
- Sorry to hear about your dad.

244
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:28,555
- Thanks.

245
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,344
- How's your mom handling it?

246
00:17:30,344 --> 00:17:33,555
- Okay, they got divorced
a while back, so.

247
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:35,095
- That's good.

248
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,216
Hey, thanks for letting me
know about that promotion.

249
00:17:38,216 --> 00:17:40,206
Nothing like a little competition, right?

250
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,976
- What?
- The director's position.

251
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:45,726
I'm interviewing for it tomorrow.

252
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,256
You're not mad, are you?

253
00:17:49,256 --> 00:17:51,592
- No, of course not.

254
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,704
- We're ready to get started.

255
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,513
We have three new patients this week.

256
00:17:56,513 --> 00:17:58,856
Jenny, I want you to take the first one.

257
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:00,966
Marilyn, why don't you brief us on Autumn.

258
00:18:00,966 --> 00:18:05,075
- Sure, let's see, patient's
name is Autumn Cooper.

259
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:09,246
She's 28 years old, she
has end stage leukemia,

260
00:18:09,246 --> 00:18:11,913
and she's comfortable at this point.

261
00:18:11,913 --> 00:18:13,944
- I did the initial assessment yesterday.

262
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:17,366
Patient refused further spiritual care,

263
00:18:17,366 --> 00:18:20,246
but God has His own ways.

264
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:22,163
- Jenny, it'll be okay.

265
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:25,424
Take a drink of water, water helps.

266
00:18:25,424 --> 00:18:26,341
Here, here.

267
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:29,616
Take this, drink, good, good.

268
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:33,155
Okay, now, please breathe slowly.

269
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,238
Deep breaths.

270
00:18:36,536 --> 00:18:38,664
Are you gonna be okay?

271
00:18:38,664 --> 00:18:39,497
Okay.

272
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:42,835
You've got nothing to worry about, Jenny.

273
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,584
Obviously, there's a
conflict of interest here,

274
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:46,915
so you won't be taking the case.

275
00:18:46,915 --> 00:18:48,675
- I'd be happy to take her, Barb.

276
00:18:48,675 --> 00:18:50,166
My case load's pretty low.

277
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:51,416
- Thanks, Mare.

278
00:18:52,515 --> 00:18:54,663
Why don't you take the
rest of the day off?

279
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:55,913
Go home, relax.

280
00:18:57,496 --> 00:18:58,964
Your friend's in good hands.

281
00:18:58,964 --> 00:18:59,797
- Yeah.

282
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,944
- I'm so sorry to hear
about your friend, Jenny.

283
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:09,277
Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.

284
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:01,483
- Hey.

285
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:03,952
- Hey.

286
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:08,346
- What you doing home?

287
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,596
- I left early.

288
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:16,482
- What happened?

289
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:26,071
- Autumn's on hospice.

290
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:32,429
- Your friend Autumn?

291
00:21:43,639 --> 00:21:45,472
What's wrong with her?

292
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,190
- She has leukemia.

293
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,701
- So she's back home now?

294
00:21:59,058 --> 00:22:00,641
- Yeah, I think so.

295
00:22:07,386 --> 00:22:10,053
Why is all this happening to me?

296
00:22:15,189 --> 00:22:17,272
- I don't know why, babe.

297
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,318
Thanks for dinner.

298
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,133
- Yeah, sure.

299
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,297
- What you thinkin' about?

300
00:23:03,189 --> 00:23:04,022
- Autumn.

301
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:10,130
God's brought her back
into my life for a reason.

302
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:13,713
I feel like He's giving
me a second chance.

303
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:17,696
I think I need to go there, now.

304
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,696
- Okay, you sure now's
the right time, though?

305
00:23:23,696 --> 00:23:26,290
- Yeah, I need to help her.

306
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,098
- I've always admired your passion.

307
00:23:28,098 --> 00:23:31,029
It's one of the many
reasons I married you.

308
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,696
But can't we have dessert first?

309
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,810
- Pray for me?

310
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:47,698
- Of course I will, I love you.

311
00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:48,948
- Love you too.

312
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,381
- Hi Jenny, it's Pastor Greg.

313
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:37,000
I just wanted to let
you know that I'm here,

314
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,667
if you need to talk.

315
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,710
- Jenny? Jenny Pluth?

316
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,639
- Hi, Mrs. C.
- How are you?

317
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:29,901
- Hangin' in there.

318
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:32,429
- It's great to see you.

319
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:34,549
- I'm sorry to intrude,
were you headed out?

320
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:36,450
- Oh, it's no problem.

321
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:39,709
You're always welcome here, any time.

322
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:42,880
I was just heading to the
store, it can wait, really.

323
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,797
Come on in!

324
00:25:48,529 --> 00:25:51,029
I haven't seen you in so long.

325
00:25:52,597 --> 00:25:53,930
- Where's Mr. C?

326
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:56,720
- Working late.

327
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,650
What have you been doing
with yourself these days?

328
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,680
Autumn said you were married.

329
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,021
- Yeah, almost five years.

330
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:06,688
- Good for you, are you working?

331
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:10,122
- Yeah, I'm a hospice nurse.

332
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,793
- Oh, we just signed
Autumn up for hospice.

333
00:26:19,149 --> 00:26:21,649
- I know, I work for New Hope.

334
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,229
- Are you her nurse?

335
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:27,479
- No, I couldn't, conflict of interest.

336
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,004
- Oh.

337
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,165
- When was Autumn diagnosed?

338
00:26:34,165 --> 00:26:36,776
- Almost two years ago.

339
00:26:36,776 --> 00:26:41,157
She's had, let's see,
three rounds of chemo,

340
00:26:41,157 --> 00:26:44,065
countless blood transfusions.

341
00:26:44,065 --> 00:26:45,898
Even a clinical trial.

342
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:49,277
Now we're here.

343
00:26:49,277 --> 00:26:51,837
- How is she holding up?

344
00:26:51,837 --> 00:26:54,587
- She's tired a lot, really weak.

345
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:57,619
She's not eating much.

346
00:26:59,525 --> 00:27:01,637
- I'm here for you guys.

347
00:27:01,637 --> 00:27:02,925
If you ever have any questions,

348
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:07,092
or if you just need someone
to talk to, let me know.

349
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,249
- Thanks.

350
00:27:11,125 --> 00:27:13,292
I moved Autumn to my room.

351
00:27:14,196 --> 00:27:15,946
You know where it is.

352
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:26,466
- And when I got back he was gone.

353
00:27:26,466 --> 00:27:28,576
I can't imagine where he'd gone to.

354
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:30,597
- He was in here just a minute ago.

355
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:35,607
- Jenny!
- Hey, how are you?

356
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:42,806
Um,,

357
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:45,389
pretty, pretty awful, actually.

358
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:51,126
Nothing pretty about it, just, just awful.

359
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:04,957
You can grab a chair, just put
those clothes on the floor.

360
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:07,416
- Still don't put your laundry away, huh?

361
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:10,916
- Shut up, I have a legitimate excuse now.

362
00:28:14,608 --> 00:28:16,488
Oh no, no, don't do that.

363
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:18,655
- It's fine, I don't mind.

364
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:26,926
- Did my mom call you or something?

365
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:30,968
- No, I found out
today at a work meeting,

366
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:32,746
of all places.

367
00:28:32,746 --> 00:28:33,579
- Sorry.

368
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:38,203
Are you my nurse?
- No.

369
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:44,460
Why didn't you tell me, Autumn?

370
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:51,727
- I didn't, I didn't wanna be a burden.

371
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:59,047
It's not like we've really
been talking lately, so I...

372
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:00,297
- I'm so sorry.

373
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:05,381
Hey, you looked good at dad's service.

374
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:09,906
- Yeah, well, I only bust out the wig

375
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:12,489
for really important occasions.

376
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:16,637
- How are you feeling now?

377
00:29:16,637 --> 00:29:17,470
- I'm,

378
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:22,320
I have some good days.

379
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,153
And bad.

380
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:27,487
Mostly bad.

381
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,890
- I'm here for you, okay?

382
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,390
Whatever you need.

383
00:29:35,501 --> 00:29:36,334
- Thanks.

384
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,530
- How are you doing spiritually?

385
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,697
- Um, you know me, I'm
more science than religion.

386
00:29:50,709 --> 00:29:52,126
- Are you scared?

387
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:55,843
- Um,

388
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,293
I don't know.

389
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,647
Not really.

390
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:11,942
Whatever's next has gotta
be better than this.

391
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:16,090
- Going to the store, need anything else?

392
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,757
- Pistachio pudding.

393
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:25,934
I don't, I don't really feel
up to seeing anyone else today,

394
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:27,767
mom, I'm really tired.

395
00:30:29,257 --> 00:30:30,257
- Okay, hon.

396
00:30:31,316 --> 00:30:32,857
It was great seeing you, Jenny.

397
00:30:32,857 --> 00:30:34,357
- You too, Mrs. C.

398
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,777
You need any water or anything?

399
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:45,756
- No, no, just waiting on that pudding.

400
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:48,857
- Okay, well, I didn't want to stay long.

401
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:50,357
I'll let you rest.

402
00:30:51,734 --> 00:30:54,067
- I get tired so easily now.

403
00:30:55,676 --> 00:30:57,676
It's really frustrating.

404
00:31:00,518 --> 00:31:02,606
- I'll stop by
tomorrow, if you want.

405
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:06,129
- No, you don't, you
don't have to do that.

406
00:31:06,129 --> 00:31:10,361
- I want to, I can bring
you dinner or something.

407
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:12,028
What would you like?

408
00:31:13,001 --> 00:31:15,918
- Mashed potatoes and creamed corn.

409
00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:19,399
- You got it.

410
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:23,153
Oh, I almost forgot.

411
00:31:26,975 --> 00:31:28,558
I got this for you.

412
00:31:31,185 --> 00:31:35,352
I thought it might answer
some questions you may have.

413
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:38,489
Come on, humor me at least.

414
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:40,989
You never know, it might help.

415
00:31:41,897 --> 00:31:42,730
- Okay.

416
00:31:44,517 --> 00:31:45,350
Fine.

417
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:50,386
- I love you, Autumn.

418
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:51,636
- Love you too.

419
00:31:55,807 --> 00:31:56,974
Thanks, Jenny.

420
00:31:58,946 --> 00:32:02,997
Sorry, I
didn't want to interrupt.

421
00:32:02,997 --> 00:32:06,449
Hi, I'm Marilyn, your hospice nurse.

422
00:32:06,449 --> 00:32:09,859
- I was just leaving, take care.

423
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:10,692
- Thanks.

424
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:16,472
- How are you feeling today?

425
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:25,829
- How's she doing?

426
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,918
- Someone her age doesn't go on hospice

427
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:33,085
until they've been through
every possible treatment.

428
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,579
She maybe has a month.

429
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,849
- That's it?

430
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:40,318
- She's gonna decline fast, too.

431
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:42,068
- She believe in God?

432
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:46,769
- No, and I don't want
to make the same mistake

433
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:50,936
I did with my dad, but I
don't wanna regret not doing

434
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:56,066
or saying something that
could change her eternity.

435
00:33:55,931 --> 00:33:57,014
- Aw.

436
00:34:26,407 --> 00:34:28,706
- Smells good, what are we having?

437
00:34:28,706 --> 00:34:30,256
- Hey, sorry, it's for Autumn.

438
00:34:30,256 --> 00:34:33,317
I'm headed over there in a bit.

439
00:34:33,317 --> 00:34:36,936
- What, but what am I supposed to eat?

440
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:39,037
- There are leftovers in the fridge.

441
00:34:39,037 --> 00:34:39,870
- Nah.

442
00:34:41,048 --> 00:34:43,616
- I can put a pizza in, if you'd like.

443
00:34:43,616 --> 00:34:44,616
- Thank you.

444
00:34:45,506 --> 00:34:47,208
- Hey, can you do the dishes?

445
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:49,696
I'm not sure what time
I'm headed back tonight.

446
00:34:49,696 --> 00:34:50,863
- Sure.

447
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:59,434
- Pizza will be ready in a
few minutes, I set a timer.

448
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,684
- Okay, thanks.

449
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:17,516
- I don't know if I can do this.

450
00:35:17,516 --> 00:35:18,849
I am so nervous.

451
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:23,768
I'm not sure what to say to her.

452
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,435
- Why not just be there for her?

453
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,688
She'll experience Jesus
through your actions,

454
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:31,855
not your words.
- Will she?

455
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:34,153
My dad didn't.

456
00:35:39,117 --> 00:35:40,700
- Share your story.

457
00:35:43,088 --> 00:35:45,806
Ask her what she believes.

458
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:48,723
You can't change her, only God can.

459
00:35:51,157 --> 00:35:54,656
And He's got His own plans for her.

460
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:55,989
- Maybe.

461
00:36:16,096 --> 00:36:19,357
- My appetite does not accurately reflect

462
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,768
the quality of these potatoes.

463
00:36:21,768 --> 00:36:23,935
- I'm glad you liked them.

464
00:36:38,808 --> 00:36:42,768
So, can I ask how your
doctor's appointment went?

465
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:43,601
- Yeah,

466
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:47,339
she said I'll probably

467
00:36:49,797 --> 00:36:52,130
be declining pretty quickly.

468
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,379
She thinks two months,

469
00:36:56,607 --> 00:36:59,524
but I think she was being generous.

470
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:07,115
- Did you get a new book?

471
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:10,032
- Yeah, yeah, my mom got it for me.

472
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,188
- What's it about?

473
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:18,757
- It's an analysis of a
bunch of different accounts

474
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:22,226
of near death experiences from like

475
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:23,917
all over the world.

476
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,167
And it's still theoretical,

477
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:29,438
but it's pretty interesting.

478
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:36,262
- Why did we stop being friends?

479
00:37:37,208 --> 00:37:38,791
- What do you mean?

480
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,048
- Why did you stop calling?

481
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:44,631
Why didn't you return my calls?

482
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:49,288
- Ever since you became a Christian,

483
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:53,858
things have been different.

484
00:37:55,296 --> 00:37:56,879
You really changed.

485
00:37:58,536 --> 00:37:59,369
And I just

486
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:06,194
didn't think we had
anything in common anymore.

487
00:38:06,194 --> 00:38:07,027
- Really?

488
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:11,893
I do see things differently,

489
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:15,143
but that doesn't change our friendship.

490
00:38:16,773 --> 00:38:20,273
You've always been my best friend, Autumn.

491
00:38:21,453 --> 00:38:24,286
- I, I, I know your faith is based

492
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:29,204
on something real for you but,

493
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:35,192
I never felt anything like that.

494
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:41,576
And I've never felt,

495
00:38:41,576 --> 00:38:46,354
I've never found any evidence
that God even exists.

496
00:38:46,354 --> 00:38:47,744
- Well, in the Bible--

497
00:38:47,744 --> 00:38:50,244
- Outside of the Bible, Jenny.

498
00:38:55,554 --> 00:38:57,387
And if there is a God,

499
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:02,194
I really don't think He cares about me.

500
00:39:02,194 --> 00:39:04,944
- Autumn, He does care about you.

501
00:39:06,943 --> 00:39:09,096
I know that He does, and He loves you

502
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,846
and He wants what's best for you.

503
00:39:15,165 --> 00:39:17,082
- Could have fooled me.

504
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:23,016
Can we talk about something else?

505
00:39:23,016 --> 00:39:24,349
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

506
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:31,674
- Hey, do you remember that time

507
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:34,662
my dad took us to Glacier Park

508
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:38,495
and we found those shiny
stones by the swings?

509
00:39:40,386 --> 00:39:43,482
He told us that story about the pirate

510
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,315
and the lost treasure.

511
00:39:46,244 --> 00:39:49,895
- Yeah, didn't we take the stones back

512
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:52,614
to your parents' house in a plastic baggie

513
00:39:52,614 --> 00:39:55,105
and bury them in the backyard?

514
00:39:55,105 --> 00:39:56,866
- With the treasure map!

515
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:58,538
- Ah, the treasure map.

516
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:01,055
- Did I ever tell you that my dad

517
00:40:01,055 --> 00:40:03,138
planned that whole thing?

518
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,004
- What?

519
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:06,796
- He brought fool's
gold and he scattered it

520
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:08,454
so we would find it.

521
00:40:08,454 --> 00:40:09,454
- No!
- Yeah!

522
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:14,942
I wonder, I
wonder if it's still there.

523
00:40:21,205 --> 00:40:25,205
- I have no idea where
we put that treasure map.

524
00:40:27,155 --> 00:40:31,315
- Well, at least the gold is safe, right?

525
00:40:31,315 --> 00:40:34,435
- Of course, it's in a plastic baggie.

526
00:40:42,645 --> 00:40:44,812
- It seems like yesterday.

527
00:40:49,944 --> 00:40:52,194
Everything changes so fast.

528
00:41:04,536 --> 00:41:05,925
- As all of you know,
this is the first time

529
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:07,784
I've ever held political office,

530
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:10,357
but I'm gonna do the very best I can.

531
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:16,783
Mayberry is a fine little town

532
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:18,960
but I think we can make it even better.

533
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,159
I think the important
thing to remember is this,

534
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:24,430
what government on any level is--

535
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,430
- Jenny, Jenny.

536
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,790
It's late.
- What time is it?

537
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:33,540
- Two in the morning.

538
00:41:39,059 --> 00:41:43,968
Thank you so much for everything
you're doing for Autumn.

539
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:47,218
It's so great to have you around again.

540
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,692
- It's so good to be around again.

541
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,390
- Bye honey, drive safe.

542
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:18,440
- 200,000 acres.

543
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,256
Some of the richest land in California,

544
00:42:21,256 --> 00:42:24,173
in the hands of two unlikely heirs.

545
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,147
- Hey, what time is it?

546
00:42:55,019 --> 00:42:56,110
Everything okay?

547
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,360
- No, it's not.

548
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,777
I asked you to do the dishes.

549
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,717
- Sorry, I fell asleep watching TV.

550
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,640
- It must be nice.

551
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,656
- What's that supposed to mean?

552
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,799
- I can't do everything around here.

553
00:43:10,799 --> 00:43:12,870
- You're the one spending
all the time with Autumn.

554
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:13,880
It would be nice if you were around here

555
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,367
every once in a while.

556
00:43:16,367 --> 00:43:19,619
- Seriously, you're giving me a guilt trip

557
00:43:19,619 --> 00:43:22,448
about being with my dying friend?

558
00:43:22,448 --> 00:43:24,948
- No, that's not what I meant.

559
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:31,581
It's late, I'm going to bed.

560
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:03,000
- Hello?

561
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,280
- Jenny, where have you been?

562
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,399
I've been trying to get a
hold of you all morning.

563
00:44:06,399 --> 00:44:08,099
- What, what time is it?

564
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,469
- It's close to 11.

565
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:11,000
You've already missed two visits.

566
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,327
- Oh no, I am so sorry.

567
00:44:12,327 --> 00:44:14,040
- I want you to
come right to the office.

568
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,928
We need to talk.

569
00:44:14,928 --> 00:44:17,261
- Okay, I'll be right there.

570
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:27,481
You wanted to see me?

571
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:28,314
- Come in.

572
00:44:31,823 --> 00:44:33,732
What's going on with you lately?

573
00:44:33,732 --> 00:44:36,752
- I overslept, I was at Autumn's late.

574
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:38,913
It won't happen again.

575
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:41,182
- How are you holding up?

576
00:44:41,182 --> 00:44:42,515
- Okay, I guess.

577
00:44:44,273 --> 00:44:46,211
- This is getting in the way of your work.

578
00:44:46,211 --> 00:44:48,730
Feel free to confide
in me or Chaplain Finn.

579
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,980
That's what we're here for.

580
00:44:54,932 --> 00:44:58,703
You know that Autumn refused
spiritual care from us, right?

581
00:44:58,703 --> 00:44:59,873
- Yeah.

582
00:44:59,873 --> 00:45:03,193
- Okay, Marilyn told me she overheard you

583
00:45:03,193 --> 00:45:05,001
sharing your faith with Autumn,

584
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:07,153
even after she told you
she didn't want you to.

585
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:08,912
- What? That's not true.

586
00:45:08,912 --> 00:45:10,972
- Normally this wouldn't
be any of my business,

587
00:45:10,972 --> 00:45:14,023
but since you represent New
Hope, this is a problem.

588
00:45:14,023 --> 00:45:17,121
- I can't believe she
said that, she's lying.

589
00:45:17,121 --> 00:45:19,903
- Were you sharing your faith with Autumn?

590
00:45:19,903 --> 00:45:21,070
- Yeah, but...

591
00:45:22,492 --> 00:45:26,452
So what, you're gonna forbid
me from talking to her?

592
00:45:26,452 --> 00:45:28,361
- I didn't say that, you just have

593
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:29,921
to be careful what you say.

594
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:31,612
- So I'm just supposed
to just watch her die

595
00:45:31,612 --> 00:45:34,113
and keep my mouth shut?

596
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:35,703
- My hands are tied, Jenny.

597
00:45:35,703 --> 00:45:37,473
We can't force our beliefs on anyone,

598
00:45:37,473 --> 00:45:39,812
especially as a company, you know that.

599
00:45:39,812 --> 00:45:43,972
- I wasn't forcing my beliefs
on her, we are old friends.

600
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:45,892
- This is not open for discussion.

601
00:45:45,892 --> 00:45:48,183
You're putting the company at risk.

602
00:45:48,183 --> 00:45:51,433
This is a liability, do you understand?

603
00:45:53,052 --> 00:45:54,871
If you care at all about the promotion,

604
00:45:54,871 --> 00:45:58,204
you'll follow orders, do you understand?

605
00:46:01,543 --> 00:46:02,376
- Yes.

606
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15,703
Can I talk to you outside?

607
00:46:15,703 --> 00:46:16,772
- Why, what's up?

608
00:46:16,772 --> 00:46:18,113
- Can we just go outside, please?

609
00:46:18,113 --> 00:46:19,281
- Whatever you have to say to me,

610
00:46:19,281 --> 00:46:21,198
you can say right here.

611
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:23,981
- Fine, why did you tell Barbara

612
00:46:23,981 --> 00:46:27,073
I was sharing my faith with
Autumn against her wishes?

613
00:46:27,073 --> 00:46:28,143
- Weren't you?

614
00:46:28,143 --> 00:46:32,281
- No, it wasn't like that and you know it.

615
00:46:32,281 --> 00:46:36,801
Are you sure this has nothing
to do with the promotion?

616
00:46:36,801 --> 00:46:39,422
You're unbelievable,
you've tried undermining me

617
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:42,113
ever since you found out
about that promotion.

618
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:45,970
- That's not true, I'm just doing my job.

619
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,303
- Is there a problem here, ladies?

620
00:46:48,303 --> 00:46:49,886
- Not here.
- Jenny?

621
00:46:50,961 --> 00:46:51,794
- No.

622
00:46:55,492 --> 00:46:56,581
- You sure there's no problem?

623
00:46:56,581 --> 00:46:58,103
It was so loud I had to leave my office.

624
00:46:58,103 --> 00:46:59,890
- I don't know what that was about.

625
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:01,412
You wanted that file on Autumn?

626
00:47:01,412 --> 00:47:02,995
- I did, thank you.

627
00:47:51,906 --> 00:47:53,489
- Hey, honey.
- Hey.

628
00:48:09,606 --> 00:48:10,699
- Where you going?

629
00:48:10,699 --> 00:48:13,158
- I'm gonna go play basketball
with Chris at the gym.

630
00:48:13,158 --> 00:48:14,075
- Oh, okay.

631
00:48:17,187 --> 00:48:19,619
- Going to Autumn's?

632
00:48:19,619 --> 00:48:21,286
- I don't know, why?

633
00:48:22,556 --> 00:48:23,973
- Just wondering.

634
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,072
See you later.

635
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:31,798
- Oh, hey, before I forget,

636
00:48:31,798 --> 00:48:34,739
we have that adoption meeting tomorrow.

637
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:35,572
- Okay.

638
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,587
- Bye.
- Bye.

639
00:48:38,587 --> 00:48:39,504
- Have fun!

640
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:03,199
- Okay, so, before I go
into the specific details

641
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,457
of our program, I wanted
to take just a minute

642
00:50:05,457 --> 00:50:07,378
to talk about adoption in general.

643
00:50:07,378 --> 00:50:09,550
Two of the biggest
questions that I get are,

644
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,201
how long is it going to take,

645
00:50:11,201 --> 00:50:14,020
and how much does it cost?

646
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,761
And though I appreciate those questions,

647
00:50:16,761 --> 00:50:20,271
I really want to encourage
you to think about adoption

648
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:23,871
differently than anything that
you've ever pursued before.

649
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:25,932
You definitely need to
think about it differently

650
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:28,949
than purchasing a car
or purchasing a home.

651
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:31,900
And though those are important decisions,

652
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:35,497
adoption is going to profoundly impact you

653
00:50:35,497 --> 00:50:37,860
and so many other people.

654
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:41,711
It is the absolute furthest
thing from a transaction.

655
00:50:41,711 --> 00:50:45,332
Adoption is so much more than that.

656
00:50:45,332 --> 00:50:47,932
So you and your spouse
need to be on the same page

657
00:50:47,932 --> 00:50:50,411
before you even get started.

658
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:54,692
And putting in the effort
now will definitely pay off.

659
00:50:54,692 --> 00:50:56,692
It'll be worth the wait.

660
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,297
- So, what'd you think?

661
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,940
- Seems like a good company.

662
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,940
- That's it?

663
00:51:11,121 --> 00:51:13,510
- What else do you want me
to say, we're not ready.

664
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:14,760
- I don't know.

665
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:17,551
- This is why I didn't want to go.

666
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:19,041
- Why?

667
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:22,519
- Because now you're set
on the idea no matter what.

668
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:23,841
You heard what they said.

669
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:25,052
There's a good chance
we make too much money

670
00:51:25,052 --> 00:51:27,801
to qualify for any grants.

671
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:31,031
How are we gonna pay for the home study?

672
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:32,372
Don't get mad, you know it's the truth.

673
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:33,539
- I'm not mad.

674
00:51:34,852 --> 00:51:35,685
- Look.

675
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,732
If this is meant to be, then it'll happen.

676
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,991
God will make a way.

677
00:51:43,991 --> 00:51:46,158
We just need to trust Him.

678
00:52:06,521 --> 00:52:07,688
- How are you?

679
00:52:16,572 --> 00:52:20,155
Jen.

680
00:52:27,441 --> 00:52:29,441
I'm scared.
- About what?

681
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,210
- I think about

682
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,590
what it's gonna be like.

683
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:44,341
- What do you think happens next?

684
00:52:46,583 --> 00:52:50,750
All evidence points to
decay.

685
00:53:00,041 --> 00:53:02,541
Aren't you gonna say anything?

686
00:53:05,263 --> 00:53:07,599
- Like what?

687
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:08,849
- I don't know,

688
00:53:11,183 --> 00:53:12,933
something reassuring.

689
00:53:14,841 --> 00:53:15,674
- I can't.

690
00:53:21,591 --> 00:53:24,521
- What do you mean you can't?

691
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:28,102
- Now you want my advice?

692
00:53:28,102 --> 00:53:28,935
- What?

693
00:53:30,692 --> 00:53:33,010
- Autumn, I'm risking my job to be here.

694
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,703
Everything in my life is falling apart

695
00:53:34,703 --> 00:53:36,731
and I just want to help you.

696
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:38,721
- Your life is falling apart?

697
00:53:38,721 --> 00:53:40,681
- I didn't mean that.

698
00:53:40,681 --> 00:53:43,181
- I didn't ask you to sit here

699
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:45,758
and watch me die.

700
00:53:50,023 --> 00:53:52,106
You wanna talk about God?

701
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:56,666
Tell me how this is part of His plan.

702
00:53:59,332 --> 00:54:01,665
Do you think I deserve this?

703
00:54:05,001 --> 00:54:07,001
Why are you here, Jenny?

704
00:54:09,743 --> 00:54:11,743
Are you here to save me?

705
00:54:13,273 --> 00:54:17,440
Or are you just here to save
yourself from the guilt?

706
00:54:23,033 --> 00:54:25,993
You're just like every
other Christian I know.

707
00:54:25,993 --> 00:54:29,673
You doubt God just as much as I do.

708
00:54:29,673 --> 00:54:32,741
You're just too afraid to admit it.

709
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:37,659
- Hey, take a deep breath.

710
00:54:38,943 --> 00:54:39,943
You're okay.

711
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:42,790
Here, here, drink this.

712
00:54:45,921 --> 00:54:46,838
Take a sip.

713
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:08,477
Do you have any Ativan?

714
00:55:11,431 --> 00:55:14,811
I'm gonna go ask your mom, okay?

715
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:23,074
Water.

716
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,197
- Are you okay, hon?

717
00:56:43,224 --> 00:56:46,243
- I gave Autumn half
a milligram of Ativan.

718
00:56:46,243 --> 00:56:49,323
She can have one to two
tablets every four hours

719
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,490
as needed for her anxiety.

720
00:56:54,171 --> 00:56:56,088
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

721
00:56:58,113 --> 00:56:59,363
- Are you sure?

722
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:10,131
- I think Autumn is
struggling, spiritually.

723
00:57:12,784 --> 00:57:15,784
I've seen spiritual distress before.

724
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,875
It's different from physical pain.

725
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:24,958
It usually manifests itself
as anger and anxiety.

726
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:32,562
- We've never been a spiritual family.

727
00:57:33,612 --> 00:57:34,445
- I know.

728
00:57:38,561 --> 00:57:42,533
- But ever since Autumn was diagnosed,

729
00:57:42,533 --> 00:57:44,783
things have changed for me.

730
00:57:45,915 --> 00:57:48,665
I do a lot of praying now, Jenny.

731
00:57:49,563 --> 00:57:50,730
- That's good.

732
00:57:55,411 --> 00:57:57,828
I'm telling you this because,

733
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:02,460
because you and Mr. C should be prepared.

734
00:58:03,881 --> 00:58:06,631
Autumn may only have a week left.

735
00:58:45,843 --> 00:58:46,760
I need you.

736
00:58:49,033 --> 00:58:51,866
Show me the way to help my friend.

737
00:58:59,021 --> 00:59:00,938
Are you even listening?

738
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:14,400
- In Cash Fast, our
pay day loan is quick and easy.

739
00:59:15,405 --> 00:59:18,988
♫ I can't fight this alone

740
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:24,642
♫ You're there and always have been

741
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:29,025
♫ When I was at my low

742
00:59:30,816 --> 00:59:34,566
♫ Your love came crashing in

743
00:59:36,235 --> 00:59:38,963
♫ I'm broken down

744
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:41,275
♫ Worn out

745
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:43,856
♫ You made my life new

746
00:59:43,856 --> 00:59:46,606
♫ So let me fall

747
00:59:49,304 --> 00:59:52,804
♫ Into you, fall into you

748
00:59:54,615 --> 00:59:57,115
♫ Let me fall

749
00:59:59,424 --> 01:00:02,924
♫ Into you, fall into you

750
01:00:04,696 --> 01:00:07,196
♫ Let me fall

751
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,005
♫ Into you

752
01:00:12,005 --> 01:00:15,405
♫ Fall into you

753
01:00:15,405 --> 01:00:17,905
♫ Let me fall

754
01:00:20,502 --> 01:00:22,494
♫ Into you

755
01:00:22,494 --> 01:00:25,161
♫ Fall into you

756
01:00:27,765 --> 01:00:31,932
♫ I'm letting go, breaking
free from all my pain

757
01:00:32,915 --> 01:00:37,835
♫ I'm letting go, getting
rid of all my shame

758
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:42,002
♫ I'm letting go into
the one and only name

759
01:00:49,125 --> 01:00:49,958
- Hey, ma.

760
01:00:52,477 --> 01:00:53,310
- Hi.

761
01:00:57,467 --> 01:00:59,805
- I'm really sorry for
the way that I acted.

762
01:00:59,805 --> 01:01:00,907
- So am I.

763
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:04,507
- And I'm sorry for not
returning your phone calls.

764
01:01:04,507 --> 01:01:08,507
- I know, you've been
through a lot, come on in.

765
01:01:24,176 --> 01:01:25,926
Thirsty?
- No, thanks.

766
01:01:52,684 --> 01:01:56,351
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said about dad.

767
01:01:57,652 --> 01:01:58,485
- I know.

768
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:05,514
- I feel like I gave up on him.

769
01:02:05,514 --> 01:02:07,097
- He gave up on us,

770
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:10,412
a long time ago.

771
01:02:11,612 --> 01:02:14,592
And he's responsible for his choices

772
01:02:14,592 --> 01:02:16,509
and their consequences.

773
01:02:18,463 --> 01:02:20,380
But that's in the past.

774
01:02:22,074 --> 01:02:24,754
We need to focus on what's in front of us.

775
01:02:24,754 --> 01:02:26,837
We still have each other.

776
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,274
I'm seeing a counselor now.

777
01:02:32,274 --> 01:02:33,524
- Good for you!

778
01:02:41,821 --> 01:02:45,904
Do you really think dad's
in a better place, mom?

779
01:02:48,794 --> 01:02:52,544
- I think God could even
forgive your father.

780
01:02:58,615 --> 01:03:00,115
- I think so, too.

781
01:03:01,735 --> 01:03:03,985
Maybe they had a long talk.

782
01:03:08,223 --> 01:03:09,056
- Maybe.

783
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:14,563
- That's all, folks.

784
01:03:14,563 --> 01:03:16,896
- Thank you for stopping by.

785
01:03:18,923 --> 01:03:20,103
- Do you have a minute?

786
01:03:20,103 --> 01:03:21,603
- Yes, come on in.

787
01:03:26,583 --> 01:03:29,223
Marilyn told me Autumn's
not doing very well.

788
01:03:29,223 --> 01:03:30,556
- No, she's not.

789
01:03:32,343 --> 01:03:34,815
- Jen, I think what you're
doing for Autumn is great,

790
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:36,363
but it puts the company at risk and--

791
01:03:36,363 --> 01:03:40,743
- I know, that's why I
wanted to talk with you.

792
01:03:40,743 --> 01:03:43,743
I thought about it and you're right.

793
01:03:45,815 --> 01:03:48,732
I'm sorry for the way that I acted.

794
01:03:49,695 --> 01:03:52,935
I'm too close to this case so,

795
01:03:52,935 --> 01:03:55,543
that's why I'm resigning.

796
01:03:55,543 --> 01:03:56,853
So I can be with my friend.

797
01:03:56,853 --> 01:03:58,084
- You're quitting?!

798
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,501
- I'm letting go.

799
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:03,135
- Are you sure
you want to do this?

800
01:04:03,135 --> 01:04:06,218
- I feel more like I need to do this.

801
01:04:07,194 --> 01:04:09,004
I already lost so much time with Autumn,

802
01:04:09,004 --> 01:04:12,623
and there's only a little time left.

803
01:04:12,623 --> 01:04:15,290
Here's my letter of resignation.

804
01:04:16,423 --> 01:04:20,703
I talked it over with Todd
and he supports my decision.

805
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:22,500
If I truly believe what I say I do,

806
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,735
then I need to live it.

807
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:27,735
Autumn means more to me than my job.

808
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:30,865
I need to be there for her.

809
01:04:31,975 --> 01:04:34,834
- Okay, I hate to see you go,

810
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:37,167
but I respect your decision.

811
01:04:38,284 --> 01:04:39,903
Don't be a stranger.

812
01:04:39,903 --> 01:04:42,004
- Thank you so much.

813
01:04:57,261 --> 01:05:00,674
Hey, I wanted to let you
know that I gave my notice

814
01:05:00,674 --> 01:05:03,431
so I could be with Autumn.

815
01:05:03,431 --> 01:05:06,463
I wish you the best of luck
in the director's position.

816
01:05:06,463 --> 01:05:07,963
Really, I mean it.

817
01:05:21,862 --> 01:05:22,794
- Can I help you?

818
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:25,404
- Yes, can we talk about my promotion?

819
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:26,674
- Your promotion.

820
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:29,002
- Well, now that Jenny has resigned,

821
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:30,602
I'm the only choice.

822
01:05:30,602 --> 01:05:32,732
What's the raise like?

823
01:05:32,732 --> 01:05:34,842
Do I get more vacation time?

824
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:37,663
- Well, you were
interviewed and had a fair

825
01:05:37,663 --> 01:05:39,282
and objective evaluation.

826
01:05:39,282 --> 01:05:40,480
- And?

827
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,299
- And your
leadership skills weren't up

828
01:05:43,299 --> 01:05:45,552
to the standards required by the position.

829
01:05:45,552 --> 01:05:47,882
We've concluded we're not
going to open the position

830
01:05:47,882 --> 01:05:50,642
at this time, I'm sorry.

831
01:05:50,642 --> 01:05:53,160
We can discuss your career
development strategy

832
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:54,827
at your next review.

833
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:25,803
- Hey Jenny, come on in.
- Thanks.

834
01:06:31,216 --> 01:06:35,383
- Autumn's been sleeping
all day, but she's up now.

835
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:42,867
The care your company has
provided has been wonderful.

836
01:06:42,867 --> 01:06:44,784
Marilyn has been great.

837
01:06:45,677 --> 01:06:49,094
I'm so thankful for the work you guys do.

838
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:04,604
- Hey.

839
01:07:06,427 --> 01:07:07,260
- Hey.

840
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:10,028
- Can I come in?

841
01:07:18,125 --> 01:07:20,208
I came here to apologize.

842
01:07:21,117 --> 01:07:24,616
I'm really sorry for
the way I treated you.

843
01:07:24,616 --> 01:07:29,277
I can be too overbearing
and controlling sometimes.

844
01:07:29,277 --> 01:07:30,444
- No, not you.

845
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:35,864
- I'm being serious,
you're ruining the moment.

846
01:07:41,676 --> 01:07:42,759
I quit today.

847
01:07:44,135 --> 01:07:45,776
- Quit what?

848
01:07:45,776 --> 01:07:47,109
- My job.
- What?

849
01:07:49,064 --> 01:07:50,565
Why?

850
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:53,005
- To be here with you.

851
01:07:53,005 --> 01:07:53,933
- Jenny!

852
01:07:53,933 --> 01:07:56,624
- You are so much more
important to me than my job.

853
01:07:56,624 --> 01:08:00,685
I couldn't let that get in
the way of our friendship.

854
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:02,935
I'm here for you now, okay?

855
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,675
- You didn't have to do that.

856
01:08:06,675 --> 01:08:07,842
- I wanted to.

857
01:08:09,315 --> 01:08:11,982
I will keep praying for you but,

858
01:08:13,982 --> 01:08:16,899
I didn't come here to preach, okay?

859
01:08:38,978 --> 01:08:40,061
- I love you.

860
01:08:43,277 --> 01:08:44,694
- I love you too.

861
01:08:53,957 --> 01:08:57,906
Todd and I are thinking about adopting.

862
01:08:57,906 --> 01:08:59,239
- Really?
- Yeah.

863
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:01,784
- That's amazing.

864
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,917
- I want to, Todd's
worried about the money.

865
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:08,167
It's expensive.

866
01:09:09,917 --> 01:09:14,084
- Can you not have the
kids the old fashioned way?

867
01:09:18,035 --> 01:09:20,157
I'm sorry, I didn't--

868
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:22,324
- No, don't be, it's okay.

869
01:09:25,346 --> 01:09:27,106
- I didn't know.

870
01:09:27,106 --> 01:09:30,023
- Yeah, I haven't told many people.

871
01:09:35,477 --> 01:09:37,498
- I think it's really wonderful

872
01:09:37,498 --> 01:09:40,545
that you're going to adopt.

873
01:09:40,545 --> 01:09:43,436
You're gonna be a great mom, Jenny.

874
01:09:43,436 --> 01:09:44,686
You deserve it.

875
01:09:45,887 --> 01:09:47,804
- We'll see, I want to.

876
01:09:50,026 --> 01:09:51,693
- You will.
- Thanks.

877
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:59,780
- I can't believe you're
doing this for me.

878
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,750
I, uh, I read a bit

879
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:15,308
of the Bible you gave me.

880
01:10:17,437 --> 01:10:19,626
Just a little bit.

881
01:10:19,626 --> 01:10:23,098
- I really didn't come here to preach.

882
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:27,265
I just wanted to be with
you when we have the time.

883
01:10:29,665 --> 01:10:32,832
There is a passage I think you'd like.

884
01:10:34,087 --> 01:10:37,004
I can mark it in the Bible for you.

885
01:10:39,607 --> 01:10:40,774
It's about how

886
01:10:43,247 --> 01:10:46,377
we need not worry about our lives,

887
01:10:46,377 --> 01:10:48,794
because God takes care of us.

888
01:10:52,167 --> 01:10:55,549
You should read it, if you'd like.

889
01:10:55,549 --> 01:10:56,382
- Okay.

890
01:10:59,867 --> 01:11:02,784
- Now, what I really came here for.

891
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:09,601
- The treasure map!

892
01:11:11,469 --> 01:11:15,636
- Yeah, next time I come
I'll bearing pirate's booty.

893
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:46,334
- So, tell me, what's so
good about this God of yours?

894
01:11:54,293 --> 01:11:58,210
- Well, I can tell you
where it started for me.

895
01:12:19,586 --> 01:12:21,186
- You're sure you don't want any help?

896
01:12:21,186 --> 01:12:25,595
- I'm fine, promised
Autumn I would find it.

897
01:12:25,595 --> 01:12:27,546
Thanks for letting me do this.

898
01:12:27,546 --> 01:12:29,855
It really means a lot to me.

899
01:12:29,855 --> 01:12:30,688
- I know.

900
01:13:36,127 --> 01:13:36,960
- Hello?

901
01:13:38,908 --> 01:13:41,748
Okay, yeah, I'll be right there.

902
01:13:41,748 --> 01:13:43,915
Thanks for the call, Mare.

903
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:31,498
- What are you writing?

904
01:15:31,498 --> 01:15:35,665
- Autumn's eulogy, her mom
asked me to speak at her wake.

905
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:45,303
- I'm proud of you.

906
01:15:46,279 --> 01:15:47,196
- For what?

907
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:49,607
- The way you've handled everything

908
01:15:49,607 --> 01:15:52,446
that you've been through.

909
01:15:52,446 --> 01:15:53,279
- Thanks.

910
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:58,914
I guess I blew our
chances at adopting, huh?

911
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,887
- You did the right thing.

912
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:30,500
- Hey, mom.

913
01:16:36,303 --> 01:16:38,470
- I'm sorry, Jen.
- Thanks.

914
01:16:41,133 --> 01:16:42,133
- Hey.
- Hey.

915
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:50,150
- I've got something for you.

916
01:16:58,383 --> 01:17:00,800
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

917
01:17:03,653 --> 01:17:05,820
- I'm gonna...
- Of course.

918
01:17:26,973 --> 01:17:31,373
- You did a lousy job
making that map you know?

919
01:17:31,373 --> 01:17:33,292
I destroyed half my mom's yard

920
01:17:33,292 --> 01:17:36,375
and still couldn't find these stones.

921
01:17:51,431 --> 01:17:53,181
It doesn't seem real.

922
01:17:55,651 --> 01:17:57,984
I can't believe you're gone.

923
01:18:01,229 --> 01:18:04,396
I'm so sorry I wasn't a better friend.

924
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:09,687
- You were a better
friend to her than you know.

925
01:18:10,623 --> 01:18:12,790
- Hey, Mrs. C.
- Hi, honey.

926
01:18:16,311 --> 01:18:18,572
I want you to know you were wonderful.

927
01:18:18,572 --> 01:18:21,391
Autumn was so happy to
have you by her side.

928
01:18:21,391 --> 01:18:23,983
- I wish I could have done more for her.

929
01:18:23,983 --> 01:18:25,562
- For what it's worth, I
don't think you could have

930
01:18:25,562 --> 01:18:27,145
done anything more.

931
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:30,853
I was going through
Autumn's things last night

932
01:18:30,853 --> 01:18:33,213
and I found the Bible you gave her.

933
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:34,713
- You can keep it.

934
01:18:35,973 --> 01:18:37,641
- You don't know how much your prayers

935
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:39,602
and support have meant to me.

936
01:18:39,602 --> 01:18:43,132
It's hard to explain, but
I felt a sense of peace

937
01:18:43,132 --> 01:18:45,562
in Autumn's passing.

938
01:18:45,562 --> 01:18:48,729
I know God was right there by my side.

939
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:07,840
- You don't know how much I needed that.

940
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:09,590
- Oh, honey.

941
01:20:18,626 --> 01:20:19,793
- Hi everyone.

942
01:20:20,747 --> 01:20:23,435
For those of you who don't know me,

943
01:20:23,435 --> 01:20:26,685
I'm Jenny Pluth Paine, Autumn's friend.

944
01:20:29,874 --> 01:20:33,874
When Mrs. Cooper asked
me to do Autumn's eulogy,

945
01:20:34,907 --> 01:20:36,776
I didn't hesitate to say yes,

946
01:20:36,776 --> 01:20:40,109
even though the idea of it terrified me.

947
01:20:42,667 --> 01:20:45,750
Autumn was my best friend growing up.

948
01:20:48,706 --> 01:20:52,373
We have some really
great memories together.

949
01:20:57,435 --> 01:20:59,768
I would do anything for her.

950
01:21:01,216 --> 01:21:02,049
She was,

951
01:21:04,205 --> 01:21:06,122
is, very special to me.

952
01:21:19,885 --> 01:21:23,635
God has taught me a lot
through this journey.

953
01:21:25,085 --> 01:21:29,252
I wasn't as strong in my
faith as I thought I was.

954
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:33,936
I learned that everyone
has their own journey,

955
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:36,353
and Autumn let me find my way

956
01:21:39,787 --> 01:21:43,537
and taught me how to
love like a real friend.

957
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,719
So, Autumn and I met at recess.

958
01:21:55,645 --> 01:21:59,019
We were play hopscotching and had to first

959
01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:01,019
draw the little squares.

960
01:22:02,955 --> 01:22:06,507
Autumn's were perfect, and
mine were all squiggly.

961
01:22:06,507 --> 01:22:09,424
And we looked back at them and she,

962
01:22:10,619 --> 01:22:13,187
she said that's because
her fine motor skills

963
01:22:13,187 --> 01:22:16,270
were exceptional, at seven years old.

964
01:22:20,956 --> 01:22:24,373
Well, Autumn, you truly were exceptional.

965
01:22:36,579 --> 01:22:37,592
Hello?

966
01:22:37,592 --> 01:22:39,269
- Hi, is Jenny Paine available?

967
01:22:39,269 --> 01:22:40,229
- This is she.

968
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:41,219
- Hi, this is Steven Marks

969
01:22:41,219 --> 01:22:42,979
with Trust Community Bank.

970
01:22:42,979 --> 01:22:44,208
I'm the Branch Manager here.

971
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:45,041
- Hi.

972
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:45,957
- I'm calling to notify you

973
01:22:45,957 --> 01:22:47,707
that you're the sole
beneficiary of an account

974
01:22:47,707 --> 01:22:50,528
held by the late Allen Pluth.

975
01:22:50,528 --> 01:22:52,037
- Okay.

976
01:22:52,037 --> 01:22:52,905
- If you could come in

977
01:22:52,905 --> 01:22:54,428
at your earliest convenience, we'd like to

978
01:22:54,428 --> 01:22:55,506
go over the account with you

979
01:22:55,506 --> 01:22:57,457
and we have a few documents
we'd like you to sign.

980
01:22:57,457 --> 01:22:59,692
- Oh, okay, sure.

981
01:22:59,692 --> 01:23:01,298
I can be there later today.

982
01:23:01,298 --> 01:23:05,215
- Thank you,
and you have a great day.

983
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:16,868
- Okay, I just need one more
signature from you right here.

984
01:23:16,868 --> 01:23:19,268
And then this is the total amount

985
01:23:19,268 --> 01:23:21,518
that was left in your name.

986
01:23:24,886 --> 01:23:26,803
- Oh, wow, I'm shocked.

987
01:23:30,636 --> 01:23:34,803
I had no idea my dad had
listed me as a beneficiary.

988
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:42,468
- Well, you're all set.

989
01:23:42,468 --> 01:23:43,718
You'll see the transfer in your account

990
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:45,576
within two to three business days.

991
01:23:45,576 --> 01:23:46,576
- Thank you.

992
01:23:48,057 --> 01:23:50,759
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

993
01:23:50,759 --> 01:23:53,647
I feel like I should.

994
01:23:53,647 --> 01:23:54,919
Have a good rest of your day.

995
01:23:54,919 --> 01:23:56,752
- Thanks, you as well.

996
01:24:06,765 --> 01:24:09,959
- Didn't see that coming, huh?

997
01:24:09,959 --> 01:24:12,947
- It still doesn't seem real.

998
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:13,780
- Yeah.

999
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:21,246
You know, I bet your dad would want us

1000
01:24:21,246 --> 01:24:24,588
to use this money to
help start our family.

1001
01:24:24,588 --> 01:24:25,921
What do you say?

1002
01:24:28,908 --> 01:24:30,479
- I think we should pray first

1003
01:24:30,479 --> 01:24:32,979
about what God wants us to do.

1004
01:24:36,047 --> 01:24:38,498
- Sounds like a plan.
