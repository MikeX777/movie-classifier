1
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:55,179
FREE LOVE

2
00:02:27,507 --> 00:02:28,474
Miss Fifine!

3
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:29,733
Fifine!

4
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:31,076
Fifine!

5
00:02:31,277 --> 00:02:32,574
Miss Fifine!

6
00:02:32,979 --> 00:02:34,446
Fifine?

7
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,679
Fifine?

8
00:02:45,158 --> 00:02:46,455
Fifine.

9
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,300
Fifine disappeared.

10
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:09,306
Maybe he's killing himself
for a fling.

11
00:03:10,617 --> 00:03:14,610
It all started a month ago,
when my grandmother died.

12
00:03:14,821 --> 00:03:18,154
and Miguel, the notary, said
that we would only open the will...

13
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:21,054
in the presence of his
two other grandchildren...

14
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,752
my cousins
Jean-Paul and Séraphine...

15
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:26,989
disappeared since the great
family feud of 1942.

16
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:32,094
Miguel looked for them.
29 days passed.

17
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,706
Hello?
Hello, Cesar?

18
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,774
Good morning, Mr. Miguel.

19
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,207
Yes.

20
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:42,472
Yes.

21
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:45,412
I think Miss Miléna
is in her room.

22
00:03:45,618 --> 00:03:47,779
Yes. I'm going to play there.

23
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,617
What's that?

24
00:03:50,823 --> 00:03:52,723
Mr. Cesar, the new chambermaid.

25
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,223
I'll take care of you.

26
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,730
Yes?

27
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:01,760
Go ahead.

28
00:04:03,403 --> 00:04:05,598
- Hello, Miguel?
- Miléna?

29
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:07,432
I found it.

30
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,198
They were traveling.

31
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,935
I have all the information.

32
00:04:13,146 --> 00:04:14,511
Just a moment.

33
00:04:18,985 --> 00:04:20,247
That's it.

34
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,518
"Jean-Paul Brett-Juval,
was born in Washington...

35
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:26,715
on March 15, 1930,
lives in Paris, etc.

36
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:29,190
Current address
Rue de Berry, 144.

37
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:32,762
Fashion photographer,
manager of the Omnia Mode agency.

38
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,365
Séraphine Brett-Juval,
Jean-Paul's younger sister.

39
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:39,299
She was born in Washington in 1939,
where she lived until her mother's death...

40
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:41,166
in 1956.

41
00:04:41,374 --> 00:04:43,171
He lived in Paris with his brother...

42
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:46,368
lives at 46 Rue Jacob,
with Mr. Robert Godard...

43
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:51,346
fashion photographer,
an associate of the aforementioned."

44
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:54,743
What a relief, Miguel.
I thought I'd never find them.

45
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,819
Your cousin is in Biarritz...

46
00:04:57,023 --> 00:05:00,481
at the Hotel Du Palais,
where I spoke to him.

47
00:05:01,027 --> 00:05:03,291
He might come on Friday.

48
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:07,057
Are you arriving on Friday?
Do you know what time?

49
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,267
It's all right.

50
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:10,959
Call again.

51
00:05:11,804 --> 00:05:13,965
Thanks and see you later, Miguel.

52
00:05:17,176 --> 00:05:19,474
You can call me Mr. Cesar.

53
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,977
Yes, Mr. Cesar.
But I'll say "you".

54
00:05:22,181 --> 00:05:25,378
If you're going to start,
I'll throw you out now.

55
00:05:25,585 --> 00:05:28,577
- So I'm calm.
- Why is that?

56
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,052
By the way you look at me.

57
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:33,582
If you are...

58
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:36,121
very kind...

59
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,061
we'll manage.

60
00:05:39,732 --> 00:05:41,393
I'm a young woman.

61
00:05:43,202 --> 00:05:45,432
- Are you laughing at me?
- No, Mr. Cesar.

62
00:05:45,638 --> 00:05:47,629
I say I'm young.

63
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,068
Good.

64
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:53,077
Rosa will show you
her room...

65
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,715
and when she's settled in,
you will see Miss Miléna.

66
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,471
What will you do with the money?
when you have it?

67
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:23,199
- I'm going to buy a "ganadería".
- A what?

68
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,240
Bull breeding.

69
00:06:25,445 --> 00:06:28,846
- I forgot you were an aficionado.
- Aficionado.

70
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:32,814
Robert, let's be serious.

71
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:38,519
We're going to have to delay our
to Cadequés by three days.

72
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:40,316
You mean?

73
00:06:41,327 --> 00:06:43,625
You're taking me to Perpignan...

74
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,628
- And, or wait for me for three days...
- Lovely.

75
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:50,963
...or go straight to Cadequés
and I'll come to you.

76
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,502
I'm sure you'll find a girl
to wait for me.

77
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:55,230
And Jean-Paul?

78
00:06:55,441 --> 00:06:57,671
He'll be arriving from Biarritz.

79
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,674
I'll make an appointment
with him in Perpignan...

80
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,870
and he'll take me to the castle.

81
00:07:02,081 --> 00:07:04,948
Are you ashamed
to come with me to the castle?

82
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:08,314
I don't want to show up
as a boyfriend.

83
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:11,581
You know, cousin Miléna
must be the type...

84
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:14,851
provincial spinster,
all stuck up and stuff.

85
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:18,258
As you wish. But I warn you
that if you find a girl...

86
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:20,489
I recommended it myself.

87
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,534
I know our agreement.
Everyone has their freedom.

88
00:07:33,145 --> 00:07:36,308
Good morning, miss.
I'll take care of the luggage.

89
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:37,915
Thank you.

90
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:42,981
Séraphine?

91
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:45,123
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too, Miléna.

92
00:07:45,324 --> 00:07:47,053
- Kiss?
- Yes.

93
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:49,861
You speak
French very well.

94
00:07:50,062 --> 00:07:52,326
I've been in France
for three years now.

95
00:07:52,532 --> 00:07:56,332
Prudence will show you to your room.
Didn't your brother come along?

96
00:07:56,536 --> 00:08:00,336
No. I came from Paris...
with a friend.

97
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,132
We slept in Perpignan.

98
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:05,242
My brother was supposed to meet me
at the hotel, but he didn't show up.

99
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,207
- No?
- But it won't be long.

100
00:09:10,977 --> 00:09:12,001
What do you want?

101
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:15,446
- Ms. Brett-Juval, please?
- From whom?

102
00:09:15,648 --> 00:09:18,742
I... say it's from
her brother's.

103
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:21,249
- Yes. It's Mr. Jean-Paul.
- Don't!

104
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,837
Jean-Paul?

105
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:01,951
Jean-Paul?

106
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:05,285
Yes.

107
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:12,300
Miléna.
I didn't recognize you, Jean-Paul.

108
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,631
Not either, Miléna.

109
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:18,869
The last time we saw each other,
I was one year old.

110
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:20,745
Of course.

111
00:10:22,615 --> 00:10:25,049
Your sister has arrived.
She didn't see you in Perpignan.

112
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:28,778
Yes. I was late.
I'd like to see you.

113
00:10:28,988 --> 00:10:31,252
I think he's in his room,
taking a shower.

114
00:10:31,457 --> 00:10:34,654
Prudence will show you her room.
It's next to hers.

115
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,124
Good morning.
Who is she?

116
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,355
She's the cook's granddaughter.
She's on vacation here.

117
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,931
When dinner is ready,
I'll send for you.

118
00:10:45,137 --> 00:10:48,368
Cesar. Do you want to look after
Mr. Jean-Paul?

119
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,396
It was your father's
of your father.

120
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,398
There's no shortage of places.

121
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:21,061
It was always called
the room of the Borgia.

122
00:11:21,273 --> 00:11:23,241
- That's right.
- You know, Mr. Jean-Paul...

123
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:28,106
it was a family joke.
Someone must have said it, and it stuck.

124
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,611
And what is it called?

125
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,873
Cesar.

126
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,881
- Cesar?
- Cesar. Excuse me.

127
00:11:34,086 --> 00:11:35,781
Well done, Cesar.

128
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,416
- The suitcases...
- No, that's fine.

129
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:40,683
No.

130
00:11:40,893 --> 00:11:45,523
- The bathroom is at the back, on the right.
- Perfect.

131
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,699
- You don't need me anymore?
- No, you don't.

132
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,993
Tell me. Where is
my sister's room?

133
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:52,830
- It's the fourth Chinese.
- Chinese?

134
00:11:53,038 --> 00:11:55,871
That's it. You'll understand,
when you see it.

135
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:58,635
Third door on the right.
Do you know it?

136
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,311
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

137
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,743
Dinner is at eight.

138
00:12:02,948 --> 00:12:05,678
- If Mr. Miguel isn't late.
- I'll be ready.

139
00:12:05,885 --> 00:12:07,853
Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

140
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:24,927
Yes. Come in.

141
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,955
Robert? You here?

142
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,752
Yes, as you can see.

143
00:12:49,962 --> 00:12:52,362
What happened?
I forbade you to come.

144
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,032
You don't forbid me anything.

145
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,566
And when you left,
your brother called.

146
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,863
- So what?
- He won't be here until Monday.

147
00:13:00,072 --> 00:13:02,199
The whole team went to Spain.

148
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,670
That's great.

149
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:06,037
I've come to tell you
what to say to your cousin.

150
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:08,406
The truth, of course.

151
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:11,208
- Difficult.
- What do you mean, difficult?

152
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:14,978
- I'll tell you.
- Have you been up to something?

153
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,390
Yeah, it sounds like a joke.

154
00:13:18,591 --> 00:13:20,991
When I arrived, the chambermaid
took me for Jean-Paul.

155
00:13:21,193 --> 00:13:22,455
- Jean-Paul?
- Yes.

156
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:25,061
And the worst thing is that his cousin
took me for him too.

157
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,494
- It's not true.
- It's the pure truth.

158
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,292
And you didn't explain?

159
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,095
I haven't explained anything.
She thinks I'm Jean-Paul.

160
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:35,569
You're completely crazy.
Why did you do that?

161
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,969
I don't know.
I thought it was funny.

162
00:13:38,677 --> 00:13:42,169
- Is it the cousin you like?
- The cousin?

163
00:13:42,648 --> 00:13:45,208
Don't play the fool.
I know you.

164
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,385
It's not the first time
you've done that to me.

165
00:13:47,586 --> 00:13:49,178
What about our agreement?

166
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:52,151
Listen. They're calling us to dinner
in five minutes.

167
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,189
Perfect. I'm hungry.

168
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:56,918
- Do you make fun of me?
- Not at all.

169
00:13:57,129 --> 00:13:59,154
It's not a tragedy
me having dinner here.

170
00:13:59,365 --> 00:14:03,131
Very well. When we're
at the table, I'll explain to Miléna.

171
00:14:03,335 --> 00:14:06,498
- Give me one night.
- Not at all, Robert.

172
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:09,970
I'll explain everything. And now.

173
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,075
Don't do that.

174
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:13,711
You'll see.

175
00:14:19,018 --> 00:14:21,452
I tried to call
to say I was going to be late...

176
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:24,487
- but your line is faulty.
- Good.

177
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,718
Cesar didn't say anything.
It's a thread. This is Mr. Miguel Barran.

178
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,157
My cousin Séraphine.

179
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:33,024
- Good evening, miss.
- Good night, ma'am.

180
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,359
Jean-Paul, Miguel Barran.

181
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,869
- Good evening, sir.
- Good night, sir.

182
00:14:40,306 --> 00:14:43,036
- That'll do, Cesar.
- Yes, miss.

183
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:46,106
Jean-Paul, on my right.

184
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:49,243
Séraphine, Miguel.

185
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,413
Robert?

186
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:00,416
Robert.

187
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:04,953
- My name is Jean-Paul.
- Please, I don't want to laugh.

188
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:07,216
So. What happens then?

189
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,223
- I'm afraid.
- Of what?

190
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,795
- The Chinese room scares me.
- You're not five anymore.

191
00:16:12,998 --> 00:16:15,432
Yes, but that's not all.

192
00:16:16,468 --> 00:16:18,834
- I'm worried.
- Worried?

193
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:21,563
Yes, with the lies.
That's going to end badly.

194
00:16:21,774 --> 00:16:25,232
No. When Jean-Paul arrives,
we'll just laugh it off.

195
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:26,911
Not me.

196
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,580
- Why didn't you say anything then?
- I don't know.

197
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:33,546
- Did you like the notary?
- Are you crazy?

198
00:16:33,752 --> 00:16:36,118
And that
is also in our agreement.

199
00:16:36,321 --> 00:16:39,779
I'll help you if you help me,
but right now, I'm sleepy.

200
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:42,984
- I want to be with you.
- No way.

201
00:16:44,263 --> 00:16:47,391
- If you don't want to, I'll tell you everything.
- Nice.

202
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:49,692
- Be kind.
- Don't.

203
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:52,428
And he says he loves me.

204
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:54,572
Did I say that?

205
00:16:54,773 --> 00:16:58,470
Well done. Since that's the case,
I won't go to Cadequés.

206
00:16:58,677 --> 00:16:59,871
Good.

207
00:17:06,852 --> 00:17:08,820
A girl.

208
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,600
Yes?

209
00:19:04,369 --> 00:19:07,304
- Good morning, Mr. Jean-Paul.
- Good morning, Cesar.

210
00:19:07,506 --> 00:19:10,270
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well.

211
00:19:10,475 --> 00:19:12,102
The weather looks good.

212
00:19:12,311 --> 00:19:14,871
It's always good weather here,
sir.

213
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:17,972
You don't seem to like it here.

214
00:19:18,183 --> 00:19:20,117
I can say that, in general...

215
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,344
and with all due respect...

216
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:24,784
I'm deeply bored.

217
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,117
- Have you been here long?
- Ten years.

218
00:19:27,326 --> 00:19:29,521
You must miss
distractions.

219
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:31,855
Only one thing interests me.

220
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:33,588
Women.

221
00:19:34,366 --> 00:19:37,130
I don't see anything wrong with that, Cesar.
On the contrary.

222
00:19:37,336 --> 00:19:39,600
Recruitment here
can't be easy.

223
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:42,103
- I have a trick.
- A trick?

224
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,331
That's it.

225
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:47,444
Lady Henriette gave me freedom
in personnel matters.

226
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:50,843
For example, I'm
who employs the chambermaids.

227
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,017
- Do you understand?
- Very well.

228
00:19:53,218 --> 00:19:57,484
I choose a local one,
one I like, of course...

229
00:19:57,689 --> 00:19:58,986
e...

230
00:20:01,593 --> 00:20:04,027
- And if she resists...
- I'll put it out the door.

231
00:20:04,229 --> 00:20:05,253
Really?

232
00:20:05,464 --> 00:20:08,661
- What if I want to get married?
- I won't allow it, Mr. Jean-Paul.

233
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,732
They end up marrying
someone local.

234
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:12,699
Having served here is a benchmark.

235
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:15,737
No. What I like is change.

236
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,501
If any of them get attached to me,
I'll throw them out.

237
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,440
Congratulations, Cesar.
You're a Casanova.

238
00:20:21,647 --> 00:20:24,445
By the way,
your latest hire.

239
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,515
- Not bad.
- What's not bad?

240
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,410
But it won't be easy.

241
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,609
No?

242
00:20:29,821 --> 00:20:34,087
She's only been here for three days
and I haven't had much time for her...

243
00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:39,723
but I have the impression
it won't be easy at all.

244
00:20:39,931 --> 00:20:42,229
Come on, Cesar, you don't have to
lose your self-confidence.

245
00:20:42,434 --> 00:20:44,095
Of course.

246
00:20:44,303 --> 00:20:46,430
Of course. But I'll try
anyway. That's for sure.

247
00:20:46,638 --> 00:20:49,436
- Good luck, Cesar.
- Thank you, Mr. Jean-Paul.

248
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:52,633
May I remind
to Mr. Jean-Paul...

249
00:20:52,844 --> 00:20:55,438
he has a meeting
in the library at 10am.

250
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:58,582
THE KING OF MODELS

251
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,715
Come on.

252
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:13,755
Prudence, I see you
out of commission.

253
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:15,958
I was waiting for your orders.

254
00:21:16,168 --> 00:21:18,693
Get the trays,
to get busy.

255
00:21:20,772 --> 00:21:22,501
Yes, Mr. Cesar.

256
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,677
Come in.

257
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:44,484
ROBERT GODARD
PHOTOGRAPHER

258
00:21:44,696 --> 00:21:46,254
What's wrong?

259
00:21:47,532 --> 00:21:50,160
Nothing. I've come for the tray.

260
00:22:05,984 --> 00:22:08,111
On the table, Cesar.

261
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:15,290
Thank you, Cesar.

262
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:22,428
First, I'd like to thank
Miguel's presence.

263
00:22:22,634 --> 00:22:26,297
You may not know it, but you read
a will in the notary's office.

264
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:28,496
It's nothing, Miléna.

265
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:33,442
I gathered them here, as notary public
of Lady Henriette...

266
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:36,478
who died on June 16th
1959, in this castle.

267
00:22:36,681 --> 00:22:39,707
She appointed me
her executor.

268
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:43,713
I will read the
she has made.

269
00:22:51,196 --> 00:22:53,528
"This is my will.
I, the undersigned...

270
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:56,860
Henriette Amélie Jeanne Juval,
widow of Sir John Brett...

271
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:59,969
- killed on June 18, 1917..."
- What?

272
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:01,332
The pencils.

273
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,269
I've never forgotten.

274
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:06,376
At the Council meetings
chaired by Lady Henriette...

275
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:09,411
- It's okay, Cesar.
- I'd put the pencils in.

276
00:23:09,614 --> 00:23:13,880
So I don't see why
I wouldn't continue...

277
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:15,677
putting...

278
00:23:15,887 --> 00:23:18,685
the pencils. There it is.
Nothing missing?

279
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,620
It's all right.
Leave us, Cesar, please.

280
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:29,724
"I make the following
as follows:

281
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:33,871
I appoint universal legatees,
jointly for the whole...

282
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:37,405
or separately, for a third,
my three grandchildren, namely...

283
00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:40,305
Jean-Paul Eric Pierre
Brett-Juval...

284
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,605
Séraphine Alexandra
Brett-Juval...

285
00:23:42,814 --> 00:23:44,805
Miléna Françoise
Brett-Juval...

286
00:23:45,016 --> 00:23:47,450
who are in charge of
distributing the following...

287
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:50,946
Mr. Cesar?

288
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:53,215
- What do you want?
- It's ugly to listen like that.

289
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:56,588
Mind your own business.
I want to know what's going on.

290
00:23:56,962 --> 00:23:59,863
I never do that
and I know everything.

291
00:24:02,901 --> 00:24:05,028
"Made, written and dated
by my hands...

292
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:07,603
healthy in body and spirit
in my castle of Aubarède...

293
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:10,798
in 1957, November 2nd.

294
00:24:11,343 --> 00:24:13,777
Signed:
Henriette Brett-Juval."

295
00:24:15,981 --> 00:24:17,608
From reading...

296
00:24:17,816 --> 00:24:20,512
except for the legacies
Casaneuve, Lerbier and Loinod...

297
00:24:20,719 --> 00:24:23,916
and taking into account the other
legacies mentioned...

298
00:24:24,122 --> 00:24:27,558
the total amount of which is
six million francs...

299
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,284
and taking into account
of Lady Henriette...

300
00:24:30,495 --> 00:24:34,363
to leave the Cardonna couple
the use of the Cedars Pavilion...

301
00:24:34,566 --> 00:24:38,297
in Sainte Marguerite
and two hectares around it...

302
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:40,835
results, I said, from reading...

303
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,497
that Lady Henriette leaves all
her estate in equal shares...

304
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:49,840
to the three grandchildren present:
Séraphine, Jean-Paul and Miléna.

305
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:54,746
There you go. It's hard to say what
these assets represent.

306
00:24:54,953 --> 00:24:57,820
However, it is my duty...

307
00:24:58,023 --> 00:25:01,322
let them know that the
of these assets...

308
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:03,687
- is minimal.
- But business is good.

309
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:05,726
- Quite well.
- Yes, but the profits...

310
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:07,990
have been reinvested
for six years...

311
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:12,101
to finance equipment
and a reserve fund.

312
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,034
I mean, it's no good.

313
00:25:16,207 --> 00:25:18,505
In the long term,
its parts are realizable.

314
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,109
And then there's the castle.

315
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:21,301
The castle?

316
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:23,572
Yes, the castle
now belongs to you...

317
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:25,977
and his brother and cousin.

318
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:28,448
Your only two problems,
at the moment...

319
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:32,589
are the problem
of inheritance rights...

320
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,884
and what to do with the castle,
between the three of you.

321
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,196
- Is he sellable?
- Hardly. Certainly below his value.

322
00:25:39,397 --> 00:25:41,831
I think Miléna
should decide.

323
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,433
Does she want to continue
to live here?

324
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,703
You know, it's only been a month...

325
00:25:47,906 --> 00:25:50,966
It's hard for me to leave,
sentimentally.

326
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:54,475
Of course. There's no hurry.
That's all there is to it.

327
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,147
In fact, nothing will be decided
before Monday.

328
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:59,510
You have to look at the banks
and each of the accounts.

329
00:25:59,718 --> 00:26:02,812
It's only Saturday.
And there's a selection tomorrow.

330
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:04,852
- There's what?
- Rugby, my dear.

331
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:06,853
He's the coach of a team.

332
00:26:07,058 --> 00:26:10,687
The winter round is coming
and Miguel would never miss it.

333
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:14,422
Don't be unfair, Miléna. I can be
at your disposal tomorrow, if you like...

334
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,726
but I don't see the point.

335
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,067
Are there any races in the region?

336
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:22,171
- Races?
- Yes. Fifine loves bullfighting.

337
00:26:22,374 --> 00:26:25,832
Actually, there's one tomorrow.
If you like, I can accompany you.

338
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,740
What about your rugby, Miguel?

339
00:26:29,547 --> 00:26:31,139
I also like bulls.

340
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:41,618
They stayed at the table
14 minutes longer than yesterday.

341
00:26:41,826 --> 00:26:44,488
- Do you time your meals now?
- Always.

342
00:26:44,696 --> 00:26:47,790
This proves that they are
getting to know each other better.

343
00:26:47,999 --> 00:26:50,467
You're clever, Cesar, you know that?

344
00:26:51,336 --> 00:26:52,928
Smart.

345
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:03,740
Mr. Cesar. Can you do that now?

346
00:27:04,816 --> 00:27:07,410
I like you. Very much so.

347
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:09,712
Is Mr. Cesar crazy?

348
00:27:11,356 --> 00:27:15,224
- Call me Cesar.
- Aren't you ashamed, Mr. Cesar?

349
00:27:30,742 --> 00:27:32,835
- Do we swim in it?
- Yes.

350
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:34,671
The water is not very clean.

351
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:38,110
The system is old.
Each time is different.

352
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:42,275
Tell me, Miléna.
Who is this Miguel?

353
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,452
Miguel?

354
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,214
Yes. Who is it?

355
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:48,153
He's a curious man.

356
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,589
Curious? Miguel?

357
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:54,265
- Does that make the clock work?
- Yes, it does.

358
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:57,925
And this is for climbing
on the roof?

359
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:01,037
No. It's to go to the tower.
Do you want to go up to the roof?

360
00:28:01,239 --> 00:28:03,901
- I'd like to.
- This way. Come along.

361
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,446
- And when did he show up?
- Miguel?

362
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:14,143
When he returned from Indochina. His father
bought him a notary's office in Perpignan...

363
00:28:14,352 --> 00:28:16,343
and a grandmother chose him as her favorite.

364
00:28:16,554 --> 00:28:19,250
And Fifine and me,
she never talked about?

365
00:28:19,457 --> 00:28:20,685
Never.

366
00:28:20,892 --> 00:28:24,453
Since the fight in 1942,
he has given up on his family.

367
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,256
His real children
were Michael and me.

368
00:28:27,866 --> 00:28:30,061
And she never thought...

369
00:28:30,268 --> 00:28:31,758
Yes.

370
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,438
- So what?
- Then nothing.

371
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:37,039
And it's none of your business.

372
00:28:37,242 --> 00:28:39,335
Why? Between cousins...

373
00:28:39,544 --> 00:28:41,512
There is no interest.

374
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:45,114
One day, Miguel and I stopped
understand each other. That's all.

375
00:28:45,316 --> 00:28:47,580
- Just like that? One day, abruptly?
- Yes.

376
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:50,211
Like this.

377
00:28:50,989 --> 00:28:52,479
One day.

378
00:28:53,758 --> 00:28:54,554
Suddenly.

379
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:02,497
What's the matter, Miléna?
Don't you feel well?

380
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,429
It's nothing.

381
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:06,297
Let's go back, Jean-Paul.

382
00:29:06,504 --> 00:29:08,938
I still have to answer
to letters of condolence.

383
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,869
Can I help you?

384
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:13,809
You can make the envelopes,
if you like.

385
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:19,313
- Why do they call her Fifine?
- It was Robert's idea.

386
00:29:19,517 --> 00:29:22,680
- He thinks Séraphine is too angelic.
- Robert?

387
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,879
Robert Godard.
My brother's partner.

388
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,491
- Yes, who I spoke to on the phone.
- That's it.

389
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,914
You still haven't told me
what you think of Miléna.

390
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,285
I hardly know her.

391
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:04,256
After five years?

392
00:30:04,462 --> 00:30:07,090
She's a lovely friend,
but very closed.

393
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:09,129
I think she's very beautiful.

394
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:11,768
Strange that I never thought of her
in any other way.

395
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,269
- Otherwise?
- Yes. If I were a man...

396
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:23,374
What are you doing there?

397
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:31,547
- Fifine. What are you doing?
- Admiring the landscape.

398
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:56,305
I mean, I don't like her?

399
00:30:56,514 --> 00:30:58,277
- No. Why?
- Why not?

400
00:30:58,483 --> 00:30:59,745
It's like this.

401
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,509
What if I send her away?

402
00:31:01,719 --> 00:31:03,983
- But why?
- Because he doesn't want to sleep with me.

403
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:06,884
- What a mentality.
- I don't like pretentious people.

404
00:31:07,091 --> 00:31:09,116
I'm not pretentious...

405
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:14,130
but I'm a virgin, Mr. Cesar.
I told you the other day.

406
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,193
Are you mocking me?

407
00:31:17,402 --> 00:31:18,596
Jure.

408
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:21,237
- What's that?
- That she's a virgin.

409
00:31:21,439 --> 00:31:23,964
Swear.
Are you mocking me?

410
00:31:24,175 --> 00:31:25,540
No, but...

411
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:29,144
- I have the right not to want to.
- You have no right at all.

412
00:31:29,347 --> 00:31:31,212
He's not my type.

413
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:33,673
You mean?

414
00:31:33,885 --> 00:31:36,718
- I don't want to say it.
- Say it anyway.

415
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,784
- You'll get angry again.
- I swear I won't.

416
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,520
Well...

417
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:46,128
I think you're a pig.

418
00:31:47,765 --> 00:31:49,960
And Johnny was going so fast
on his bike...

419
00:31:50,168 --> 00:31:52,898
that when he crossed
the village, no one saw.

420
00:31:53,104 --> 00:31:55,368
So, as there was
anything in the village...

421
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:58,201
people said:
"It's Johnny coming through".

422
00:32:01,813 --> 00:32:03,212
How silly.

423
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:08,919
- Do you think they're suspicious?
- Not Miléna, anyway.

424
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,783
We'd better not be together
too long. You may notice.

425
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:16,483
I have the impression that you
started looking after the little cousin.

426
00:32:16,694 --> 00:32:18,093
Yes. I have my plan.

427
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:21,788
I'll take care of her and you'll take care of him.
We're in agreement, aren't we?

428
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,026
What if I fall in love with him?
He's handsome.

429
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:27,295
Much better.
Beautiful and seductive.

430
00:32:27,505 --> 00:32:28,733
Much better.

431
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,431
Almost as beautiful
as Luis Miguel Dominguin.

432
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:35,134
- Who?
- Please, Robert. It's not funny.

433
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,076
What's that?

434
00:32:40,385 --> 00:32:42,979
That's it. It's started again.
Curious, this mania.

435
00:32:59,804 --> 00:33:03,740
- Do you think that's normal?
- It's someone playing the organ.

436
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,306
At midnight?

437
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,911
Go and see, Robert.
This kind of thing terrifies me.

438
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:33,259
Excuse my curiosity.
I thought it was a ghost.

439
00:34:33,464 --> 00:34:35,022
No. It's me.

440
00:34:35,233 --> 00:34:37,133
I like playing at night.
It's like an addiction.

441
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,927
Nice addiction.

442
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,662
- Was it "Jesus, Joy of Men"?
- Yes.

443
00:34:42,273 --> 00:34:44,798
There's something about this song...

444
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:48,409
of suffering,
which has always fascinated me.

445
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:50,638
Of threatened joy.

446
00:34:51,816 --> 00:34:53,147
Good.

447
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,412
So, good night.

448
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,247
Good evening.

449
00:35:23,147 --> 00:35:24,910
Prudence?

450
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:26,481
Prudence?

451
00:35:27,485 --> 00:35:28,679
Open.

452
00:35:29,387 --> 00:35:31,378
I won't do anything.

453
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:33,614
- I came to talk.
- No, I didn't.

454
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:36,452
Prudence.
I'm going to break down the door.

455
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:40,661
Prudence? Prudence?
Are you listening, Prudence?

456
00:35:51,876 --> 00:35:53,343
Mr. Cesar?

457
00:35:53,544 --> 00:35:55,637
Take my tray
and give me yours.

458
00:35:55,846 --> 00:35:58,110
Take Miss Fifine's,
I'll take Mr. Jean-Paul's.

459
00:35:58,316 --> 00:36:00,876
Why do you want to
take his?

460
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:03,212
Don't you want to see Miss Fifine
in bed in the morning?

461
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:06,288
- Yes, she is.
- She's pretty, isn't she?

462
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:08,390
What about you?

463
00:36:09,093 --> 00:36:11,061
All right, then. Let's switch.

464
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:16,723
Let's go.

465
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:18,526
Come on, come on.

466
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:04,311
Come in.

467
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:13,388
- Good morning, Mr. Robert.
- What's this?

468
00:37:13,591 --> 00:37:15,957
Nothing, Mr. Godard.
I said good morning.

469
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,323
- Who said that?
- My little finger.

470
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,225
Come here, you.

471
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:23,731
Put the tray down.

472
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,930
You're good, Prudence.
You won't say anything.

473
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,836
- But I can.
- It's a joke.

474
00:37:32,043 --> 00:37:33,510
It's only two days.

475
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:36,509
- That's it.
- What do you mean, that's it?

476
00:37:36,714 --> 00:37:38,079
Listen.

477
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:41,945
- I can buy your silence.
- Very nice.

478
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:44,781
It's you who are beautiful.
Very.

479
00:37:48,225 --> 00:37:49,988
What would please her?

480
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:52,826
I don't know.

481
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:55,328
Don't be afraid.
I'll give you whatever you want.

482
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:57,364
I'm not afraid.

483
00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:15,379
Hello?

484
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,144
Miguel.

485
00:38:17,621 --> 00:38:19,452
A game of pool?

486
00:38:19,657 --> 00:38:22,057
I only played it in Indochina.

487
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,920
But it's fine, yes.

488
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:26,756
I'm going to finish getting dressed.
See you soon.

489
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:32,267
You'll be nice
and wait for me to come and talk to you.

490
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:35,030
- When?
- When?

491
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,434
In his room, at midnight.

492
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:39,666
I'll keep it under warranty.

493
00:38:39,877 --> 00:38:41,640
All right today?

494
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:43,438
I'll see.

495
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,408
A real vacation.

496
00:39:12,243 --> 00:39:14,803
I never thought,
when I arrived.

497
00:39:15,012 --> 00:39:18,948
- Confess that you didn't like the idea.
- I didn't know her.

498
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,778
Are you disappointed
with the inheritance?

499
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:23,681
No. Not at all.

500
00:39:23,888 --> 00:39:26,584
I mean, a little bit.

501
00:39:27,591 --> 00:39:32,085
- Not that I want to be rich...
- But I will be. It's only a matter of time.

502
00:39:32,296 --> 00:39:34,230
It doesn't matter to me.

503
00:39:36,066 --> 00:39:40,162
I really enjoyed meeting her.
I've never had any friends.

504
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:42,635
I like you too.

505
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,104
- Have we dropped the formality?
- Absolutely.

506
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:47,937
- Do you want to?
- Yes. If you want to.

507
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,380
Your sister is wonderful.

508
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:54,881
- My sister?
- Yes. Fifine.

509
00:39:55,419 --> 00:39:57,683
- Isn't she your sister?
- Yes, she is.

510
00:39:57,888 --> 00:40:00,049
- Unfortunately.
- Unfortunately?

511
00:40:00,257 --> 00:40:02,885
Yes, she's a
very funny girl.

512
00:40:03,093 --> 00:40:07,325
She has a clownish side, but deep down,
she's very sensitive and disarming.

513
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:11,796
That's funny. I imagined you
old maid and provincial.

514
00:40:13,704 --> 00:40:16,764
- With glasses and a bun?
- Yes. Almost.

515
00:40:16,974 --> 00:40:20,034
It's just that I'm provincial,
compared to you.

516
00:40:20,244 --> 00:40:22,735
- You've read everything, seen everything...
- Come on, don't exaggerate.

517
00:40:22,947 --> 00:40:24,938
He knows everything.

518
00:40:25,149 --> 00:40:26,639
Except the bulls.

519
00:40:28,118 --> 00:40:31,019
I find her very frank and direct.

520
00:40:33,357 --> 00:40:37,384
- Unable to conceal.
- Every woman conceals something.

521
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:40,325
Look at Miléna,
which seems so mysterious.

522
00:40:40,531 --> 00:40:43,989
Certainly, deep down,
it's as transparent as glass.

523
00:40:44,768 --> 00:40:46,668
Don't kid yourself, Jean-Paul.

524
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:49,931
- Miléna has its problems.
- Which problems?

525
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:53,171
I don't know. There's something about her...

526
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:55,470
suspended, tied up.

527
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,640
Miléna is a woman in waiting.

528
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:00,908
Maybe I'll wait for you.

529
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:02,642
What do you mean?

530
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:03,945
Nothing.

531
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:06,147
It's an impression.

532
00:41:07,525 --> 00:41:09,390
There's nothing
between Miléna and me.

533
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,720
That's all.

534
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,393
Shall we find them?

535
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:15,895
Okay.

536
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:31,539
Look, Miléna,
how sinister they look.

537
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:33,148
Sinister, no.

538
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:35,818
- Very nice.
- You're right.

539
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,318
- Are you calling each other "you"?
- Aren't we all?

540
00:41:38,522 --> 00:41:41,286
- Miguel, what's up?
- Yes. Fifine. If you like.

541
00:41:41,492 --> 00:41:44,017
- I would never have dared.
- Now, don't be formal.

542
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:46,696
- Cousin, you're beautiful.
- Cousin, you're fun.

543
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:48,592
And Miguel and Miléna don't say "you"?

544
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:51,427
It's been five years,
let's not start today.

545
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,193
May I serve you, miss?

546
00:41:53,404 --> 00:41:55,599
In five minutes, Prudence.
We're not having lunch like this.

547
00:41:55,806 --> 00:41:58,036
- But Mr. Cesar said...
- Well, Cesar can wait.

548
00:41:58,242 --> 00:41:59,368
I'm going to the shower.

549
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:01,909
- Did you call the factory, Miguel?
- No. I forgot.

550
00:42:02,112 --> 00:42:04,945
- I'll call you while you change.
- All right, then.

551
00:42:05,149 --> 00:42:07,583
And I can call him
"you"?

552
00:42:07,785 --> 00:42:09,218
Prudence.

553
00:42:16,193 --> 00:42:18,991
I remind you that your race
is at 4pm.

554
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,758
Check the lady.

555
00:42:28,205 --> 00:42:29,570
LETTERS TO MILENA

556
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:31,900
"Miléna is a
rich and dense.

557
00:42:32,109 --> 00:42:33,872
However, at first,
I didn't like it very much...

558
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:37,911
although it is,
by color and shape...

559
00:42:38,115 --> 00:42:40,106
a woman we take
in our arms...

560
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:42,911
that we ripped from the world
or fire, I don't know...

561
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,179
and who girds himself
in your arms...

562
00:42:45,389 --> 00:42:47,949
docile, confident."

563
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:51,250
I don't want to be
from the world.

564
00:42:51,462 --> 00:42:52,690
No fire?

565
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:56,161
Can I take the coffee?

566
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:57,925
Cesar? Something wrong?

567
00:42:58,135 --> 00:43:00,501
It's the little one.
She made my mouth water.

568
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,604
And when that's the case,
I must drink.

569
00:43:02,806 --> 00:43:05,138
- And she doesn't want to.
- Despite my advice?

570
00:43:05,342 --> 00:43:08,778
- What is this mystery?
- Cesar sighs for Prudence.

571
00:43:08,979 --> 00:43:09,946
Sigh?

572
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:13,742
I know that. Please,
don't bother that girl.

573
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:16,784
Cesar, change your technique.
Pour on the steam.

574
00:43:16,987 --> 00:43:19,615
- The steam?
- Tell her you love her.

575
00:43:19,823 --> 00:43:21,484
Put one knee on the ground...

576
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:24,388
- A knee on the ground?
- Yes. And ask for his hand.

577
00:43:24,595 --> 00:43:25,823
And I ask for his hand.

578
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,999
- What if she gives it to me?
- Just pull. The rest follows.

579
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:31,958
Jean-Paul,
you're disgusting.

580
00:43:33,137 --> 00:43:35,264
So any medium counts?

581
00:43:36,407 --> 00:43:38,307
It didn't always work out.

582
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:42,144
Jean-Paul is wrong.
Love is not to be trifled with.

583
00:43:42,346 --> 00:43:45,440
- Beautiful commonplace
- What should I do then?

584
00:43:45,649 --> 00:43:48,948
- Declare yourself now, attack at night.
- He's right.

585
00:43:49,987 --> 00:43:52,251
Night is the oblivion
of the day.

586
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:53,616
That's wrong.

587
00:43:54,458 --> 00:43:56,983
The night divides those who love.

588
00:43:58,629 --> 00:44:01,792
Tonight,
I want to dance in the moonlight.

589
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:03,398
Beautiful.

590
00:44:05,135 --> 00:44:06,762
Check and kill.

591
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:19,247
Prudence, I love you.

592
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,714
- Don't start again.
- No, Prudence, it really is love.

593
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,218
- But how?
- Platonically.

594
00:44:25,422 --> 00:44:28,482
- Are you ill, Mr. Cesar?
- Give me your hand, Prudence.

595
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:30,853
- No way.
- Please, Prudence.

596
00:44:31,061 --> 00:44:32,551
I want to get married.

597
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:35,288
- It's the heat.
- I want to marry her.

598
00:44:35,499 --> 00:44:37,558
- Are you serious?
- Do you like children?

599
00:44:37,768 --> 00:44:39,292
- No.
- Me neither.

600
00:44:39,503 --> 00:44:42,165
What's it like?
What's all this?

601
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:45,432
Miss, Mr. Cesar
wants to marry me.

602
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,303
Don't listen to that satyr.

603
00:44:47,511 --> 00:44:50,173
- Have you arranged the whisky for today?
- Of course. I'll check.

604
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,642
- I'm counting on you.
- Yes.

605
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:54,113
And stop making a fool of yourself.

606
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,616
Remember, it's your day off.
And yours too, Prudence.

607
00:44:56,820 --> 00:45:00,017
- If you want to go to the race...
- Thank you, miss.

608
00:45:00,724 --> 00:45:05,354
- Say it. Are you a satyr?
- Me? No, no.

609
00:45:05,562 --> 00:45:07,894
Watch out, Cesar.
I've got my eye on you.

610
00:45:08,098 --> 00:45:11,067
You can woo me if you want,
but properly.

611
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:13,166
Thank you.

612
00:45:13,904 --> 00:45:15,963
But why whisky?

613
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:20,234
They're having a party,
a month after Grandma's death?

614
00:45:20,444 --> 00:45:21,843
The night...

615
00:45:22,546 --> 00:45:24,377
is the forgetfulness of the day.

616
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:33,171
Music, please.

617
00:47:35,078 --> 00:47:37,046
Don't shout like that.
Let's have some music.

618
00:47:37,247 --> 00:47:38,874
"Slow, please.

619
00:47:59,536 --> 00:48:01,299
- Dance?
- Yes.

620
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:27,824
"Although it is,
by color and shape...

621
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,556
a woman we take
in our arms..."

622
00:48:31,535 --> 00:48:33,799
What are we holding in our arms?

623
00:48:34,571 --> 00:48:37,563
- "That we pluck from the world."
- "Or fire."

624
00:48:37,774 --> 00:48:41,403
- "I don't know."
- "Who's wrapped in your arms...

625
00:48:41,611 --> 00:48:44,239
docile, confident."

626
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,393
Are you rejecting me?

627
00:49:38,602 --> 00:49:39,728
Hello.

628
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:42,496
I mean you no harm.

629
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,907
I know.

630
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:48,572
Are you leaving me?

631
00:49:49,413 --> 00:49:50,675
Hello.

632
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:22,541
- Are your loves going well?
- You're my only love.

633
00:50:22,746 --> 00:50:24,873
- Did you drink?
- Yes, quite a lot.

634
00:50:25,082 --> 00:50:26,674
I prefer it that way.

635
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:29,584
Do you like him?

636
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,548
A lot.

637
00:50:31,755 --> 00:50:34,087
- It's even dangerous.
- What's dangerous?

638
00:50:34,291 --> 00:50:36,987
- Playing with love.
- That's all.

639
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:39,662
- Time is suspended.
- To what?

640
00:50:39,863 --> 00:50:42,024
If we only knew...

641
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:45,099
- How are you?
- Not too well.

642
00:50:45,302 --> 00:50:46,462
I think she's afraid.

643
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,570
- Afraid?
- Yes.

644
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:50,232
And so am I.

645
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,204
- You?
- Yes. Me.

646
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,139
Give him a drink.

647
00:50:55,879 --> 00:50:57,540
It's an idea.

648
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:26,158
Miléna, you're my
cousin.

649
00:52:29,573 --> 00:52:32,201
- You must have others.
- No.

650
00:52:33,343 --> 00:52:34,935
No more.

651
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:44,216
See you tomorrow morning.

652
00:52:46,590 --> 00:52:48,490
Until whenever you want.

653
00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:07,100
Are you leaving me again?

654
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:09,736
Hello.

655
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:52,165
She's the kind of woman
who slips through your fingers.

656
00:55:55,278 --> 00:55:57,644
It appeared! I knew you
were hiding!

657
00:55:57,847 --> 00:55:59,747
Be kind, Mr. Cesar.
Leave me alone.

658
00:55:59,949 --> 00:56:02,611
Be yourself. If you're kind,
I won't hurt you!

659
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:04,047
No?

660
00:56:04,254 --> 00:56:06,119
No! No!

661
00:56:09,092 --> 00:56:10,616
Stop right there!

662
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:13,786
Bitch!

663
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:15,520
Stop!

664
00:56:16,266 --> 00:56:17,699
Stop!

665
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:20,398
You'll see!

666
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:23,371
Stop!

667
00:56:25,809 --> 00:56:28,403
- Leave me alone! Go to bed!
- With you!

668
00:56:28,611 --> 00:56:29,839
- No!
- With you!

669
00:56:30,046 --> 00:56:31,411
- No!
- Yes!

670
00:56:36,419 --> 00:56:38,751
Did you say you loved me?
That you wanted to get married?

671
00:56:38,955 --> 00:56:41,116
- Right away!
- No! No!

672
00:56:42,859 --> 00:56:44,190
You dirty man!

673
00:56:44,394 --> 00:56:48,262
- Are you crazy or what?
- I'm going to love you! I'm going to love you!

674
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,157
Come here!

675
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:52,493
Come here!

676
00:56:57,974 --> 00:56:59,908
Come here! Come here!

677
00:57:01,444 --> 00:57:03,742
- Come here! Stop! Stop!
- Stop!

678
00:57:04,581 --> 00:57:06,606
Help! Help! He's out of his mind!

679
00:57:26,269 --> 00:57:29,102
Don't come any closer. We're not
do this here, only in bed.

680
00:57:29,305 --> 00:57:31,466
- Not today! Tomorrow! Get out!
- Right now!

681
00:57:31,674 --> 00:57:33,869
- Help me!
- Prudence!

682
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,555
Now I've got you.

683
00:57:48,758 --> 00:57:51,659
- You can let me go!
- No! Listen. Stay still.

684
00:57:51,861 --> 00:57:54,295
My pretty.
My little cutie.

685
00:57:54,497 --> 00:57:56,294
Come on, let's go.

686
00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:08,970
Damn.

687
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:19,645
Cesar.

688
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:21,612
I think this is yours.

689
00:59:21,818 --> 00:59:24,082
To complete your collection.

690
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,720
My collection?

691
00:59:25,922 --> 00:59:28,152
Come on, Cesar.
You did what you could.

692
00:59:28,358 --> 00:59:30,292
He surrendered to the setbacks
of the war.

693
00:59:30,493 --> 00:59:32,051
Reversals of the war.

694
00:59:32,261 --> 00:59:34,695
Do you know what
William of Orange?

695
00:59:34,897 --> 00:59:37,092
"You don't have to wait
to undertake...

696
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,268
nor overcome in order to persevere."

697
00:59:39,469 --> 00:59:41,869
- William of Orange.
- William of Orange...

698
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:43,504
"the Taciturn".

699
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:47,233
The Taciturn?
So, that being the case...

700
01:01:32,582 --> 01:01:35,915
Do you know what
William of Orange?

701
01:01:36,119 --> 01:01:37,518
No.

702
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,018
But he must have been right.

703
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,234
Miléna, my love.

704
01:03:09,846 --> 01:03:11,438
Jean-Paul.

705
01:03:48,551 --> 01:03:50,746
You're charming.

706
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:52,750
Do you love me?

707
01:03:52,955 --> 01:03:54,718
You said "without feelings".

708
01:03:56,158 --> 01:03:58,126
Just so you know.

709
01:03:59,662 --> 01:04:01,596
I'll tell you tomorrow.

710
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:32,585
Do you love me?

711
01:04:32,795 --> 01:04:34,456
I love her.

712
01:06:07,256 --> 01:06:08,723
Come in.

713
01:07:17,793 --> 01:07:19,317
ROBERT GODARD
PHOTOGRAPHER

714
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:36,804
Did you sleep well?

715
01:07:37,546 --> 01:07:40,947
- I haven't slept a wink.
- But he's waking up.

716
01:07:41,150 --> 01:07:45,052
- I was pretending.
- I was lying. I was sleeping like a child.

717
01:07:46,055 --> 01:07:48,489
I dreamt that I couldn't sleep.

718
01:07:49,625 --> 01:07:51,320
You're a baby.

719
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:54,329
But it was you who seduced me.

720
01:07:55,898 --> 01:07:58,059
Do you think I'm a flirt?

721
01:07:58,601 --> 01:08:00,262
Yes, I think so.

722
01:08:00,469 --> 01:08:02,232
Don't laugh, Miguel.

723
01:08:03,205 --> 01:08:06,504
- I'm sad.
- Sad? What are you sad about?

724
01:08:08,511 --> 01:08:09,910
I don't know.

725
01:08:11,046 --> 01:08:13,844
- As if I were going to die.
- Are you crazy?

726
01:08:14,517 --> 01:08:16,075
Crazy and robust.

727
01:08:16,285 --> 01:08:18,150
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

728
01:08:18,354 --> 01:08:20,982
It's Monday. I'm going to work.
For you.

729
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:23,988
I still have phone calls to make
for your will.

730
01:08:24,193 --> 01:08:26,024
I'll be back later.

731
01:08:26,228 --> 01:08:28,924
- Have you thought about it?
- About what?

732
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:32,064
If you love me.

733
01:08:32,268 --> 01:08:33,735
I'll tell you tonight.

734
01:08:34,637 --> 01:08:36,901
- No. Now.
- Later.

735
01:08:37,306 --> 01:08:39,672
Later,
when I get back.

736
01:09:01,997 --> 01:09:04,431
- Miguel?
- Good morning, Miléna.

737
01:09:06,602 --> 01:09:08,092
Did you sleep well?

738
01:09:08,304 --> 01:09:10,568
I want to show you something,
Miguel.

739
01:11:00,449 --> 01:11:02,679
Are you hiding, Miléna?

740
01:11:06,889 --> 01:11:08,254
Yes.

741
01:11:08,457 --> 01:11:11,756
Like in melodramas,
I'm not who you think I am.

742
01:11:12,728 --> 01:11:14,457
Who are you, Jean-Paul?

743
01:11:14,663 --> 01:11:17,359
- I'm not Jean-Paul.
- I know.

744
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:19,957
Robert Godard.

745
01:11:21,804 --> 01:11:23,931
Who are you, Robert Godard?

746
01:11:24,139 --> 01:11:26,767
Nothing complicated.
I'm Jean-Paul's partner.

747
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,307
We've been working together
for five years.

748
01:11:29,511 --> 01:11:31,604
We founded a
fashion photo agency.

749
01:11:31,814 --> 01:11:34,783
Fifine told me about you.
About her Robert.

750
01:11:34,983 --> 01:11:37,679
- After all, he's Fifine's lover.
- Was.

751
01:11:38,454 --> 01:11:42,390
- Don't play with words.
- I don't. I was Fifine's lover.

752
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,583
Now I'm yours and
and I love you.

753
01:11:45,794 --> 01:11:48,354
What about her? Didn't you love her?

754
01:11:48,931 --> 01:11:51,297
I liked her. She's different.

755
01:11:52,701 --> 01:11:54,464
Whatever.

756
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:56,570
What's with the comedy?

757
01:11:57,106 --> 01:11:58,698
Because of you.

758
01:11:59,308 --> 01:12:00,673
Mine?

759
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:02,941
Passion at first sight.

760
01:12:03,145 --> 01:12:04,806
When I arrived on Saturday...

761
01:12:05,013 --> 01:12:06,776
you said, "Jean-Paul?"

762
01:12:06,982 --> 01:12:09,348
and I said yes, because
I wanted to be with you.

763
01:12:09,818 --> 01:12:13,777
Easy to say now.
I don't believe it, Jean-Paul.

764
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:17,892
- You're talking nonsense.
- It's not nonsense. It's true.

765
01:12:20,562 --> 01:12:24,589
You're a buffoon.
You wanted an adventure, that's all.

766
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:28,095
What amazes me is
Fifine being part of the arrangement.

767
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:29,895
It wasn't agreed.

768
01:12:30,105 --> 01:12:33,836
- Yes. So she knew?
- It was give and take.

769
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:35,737
You mean?

770
01:12:36,578 --> 01:12:39,376
If I revealed that I was her lover,
she wouldn't have Miguel...

771
01:12:39,581 --> 01:12:42,379
and if he'd known about me,
he wouldn't have dared.

772
01:12:42,584 --> 01:12:44,643
It would have been better.

773
01:12:44,853 --> 01:12:46,480
What nonsense.

774
01:12:46,688 --> 01:12:49,179
You should have known
that I would find out.

775
01:12:49,391 --> 01:12:52,087
- It didn't take long.
- How did you know?

776
01:12:52,294 --> 01:12:53,318
Prudence.

777
01:12:53,529 --> 01:12:56,498
I know, I know.
Dear Prudence.

778
01:12:57,032 --> 01:12:59,227
And the first thing he did
was to tell Miguel.

779
01:12:59,435 --> 01:13:01,494
Of course. Do you realize that?

780
01:13:01,703 --> 01:13:03,762
He opened a will
in front of a false brother.

781
01:13:03,972 --> 01:13:06,873
- So what? He went to get the police?
- You're out of your mind.

782
01:13:07,075 --> 01:13:10,602
- And where is Jean-Paul?
- He should be here soon.

783
01:13:10,813 --> 01:13:13,407
Saturday, on the phone,
he said he was coming Monday.

784
01:13:14,516 --> 01:13:17,417
- So everything falls into place?
- No.

785
01:13:17,986 --> 01:13:19,715
You stay with me.

786
01:13:19,922 --> 01:13:21,583
Not at all.

787
01:13:22,191 --> 01:13:23,158
And Fifine?

788
01:13:23,358 --> 01:13:25,349
- He's young. He'll console himself.
- How do you know?

789
01:13:25,561 --> 01:13:28,359
Fifine and I were friends
who slept together, and that was it.

790
01:13:28,564 --> 01:13:31,931
- She will console herself with Miguel.
- Miguel is a womanizer.

791
01:13:32,134 --> 01:13:34,398
He always had a lot of women.

792
01:13:34,603 --> 01:13:37,697
If he gets what he wants,
she will be unhappy.

793
01:13:37,906 --> 01:13:40,466
I'm convinced
that you love him.

794
01:13:42,144 --> 01:13:43,168
Fifine!

795
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:46,472
- Come on, that's what's needed.
- Come quickly.

796
01:13:49,284 --> 01:13:50,546
Fifine!

797
01:13:51,086 --> 01:13:53,020
- Fifine!
- Fifine!

798
01:14:00,429 --> 01:14:03,592
- Cesar, have you seen Miss Fifine?
- Miss Fifine?

799
01:14:03,799 --> 01:14:05,562
- And you, Prudence?
- No, miss.

800
01:14:05,767 --> 01:14:07,291
- What happened?
- Fifine has disappeared.

801
01:14:07,503 --> 01:14:09,971
- I'll explain. She could kill herself.
- Kill herself?

802
01:14:10,172 --> 01:14:12,572
- Search before the brother arrives.
- What's wrong?

803
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:14,173
- Does she have another brother?
- Yes, come on.

804
01:14:14,376 --> 01:14:16,037
Another brother?

805
01:14:23,752 --> 01:14:25,720
- It's my fault.
- No. It's mine.

806
01:14:25,921 --> 01:14:28,287
- I should say I loved her.
- Is this the time to argue?

807
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:30,253
- It's my fault.
- No. It's Jean-Paul's.

808
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:33,292
Robert, in fact.
Here's how his story turned out.

809
01:14:33,495 --> 01:14:34,985
- Miléna...
- That's it.

810
01:14:35,197 --> 01:14:37,290
If anything happens to him,
I won't forgive you.

811
01:14:37,499 --> 01:14:39,126
Let's look in the garden.

812
01:14:41,136 --> 01:14:42,467
Don't you love me anymore?

813
01:14:42,671 --> 01:14:44,798
I don't have time
to think about it.

814
01:14:49,444 --> 01:14:50,741
Fifine?

815
01:14:52,014 --> 01:14:53,413
Fifine?

816
01:15:01,423 --> 01:15:03,118
Miss Fifine!

817
01:15:12,768 --> 01:15:13,894
Miss Fifine!

818
01:15:14,169 --> 01:15:15,158
Fifine!

819
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,667
Fifine!

820
01:15:17,306 --> 01:15:18,830
Miss Fifine!

821
01:15:21,176 --> 01:15:22,609
Fifine?

822
01:15:25,914 --> 01:15:27,245
Fifine?

823
01:15:31,853 --> 01:15:33,377
Fifine?

824
01:15:49,605 --> 01:15:51,835
Fifine disappeared.

825
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:55,741
Maybe he's killing himself
for a fling.

826
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:01,809
The four of us played the
of thoughtless love.

827
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:04,281
We take ourselves for libertines.

828
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:20,358
A car is coming.

829
01:16:58,073 --> 01:16:59,438
Good morning.

830
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:01,172
Good morning.

831
01:17:05,213 --> 01:17:07,545
- Are you Mr. Jean-Paul?
- Yes.

832
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:09,614
Mr. Jean-Paul!

833
01:17:13,388 --> 01:17:16,084
- Miguel Barran.
- Jean-Paul Brett-Juval. What's going on?

834
01:17:16,291 --> 01:17:17,622
Fifine disappeared.

835
01:17:17,826 --> 01:17:20,556
- My sister?
- What a time to arrive.

836
01:17:20,762 --> 01:17:23,026
- What are you doing there?
- Fifine has disappeared.

837
01:17:23,231 --> 01:17:26,200
- He's already said it. Explain.
- Do you remember that you wanted to kill yourself?

838
01:17:26,401 --> 01:17:28,733
- What about it?
- I'm afraid it'll start again.

839
01:17:28,937 --> 01:17:30,666
- Why?
- I'll explain later.

840
01:17:30,872 --> 01:17:32,931
- Are you Jean-Paul?
- Yes.

841
01:17:33,141 --> 01:17:35,234
I'm Miléna.
I'm sorry to see you like this.

842
01:17:35,444 --> 01:17:37,844
- The welcome is strange.
- Your sister has disappeared.

843
01:17:38,046 --> 01:17:39,274
- Did you look?
- Yes.

844
01:17:39,481 --> 01:17:41,449
- You too, Cesar?
- All that's missing is the basement.

845
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:43,948
- The swimming pool.
- That's right. I'll check it out.

846
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,985
- What can I do?
- Nothing.

847
01:17:47,589 --> 01:17:49,921
- I'll go back to the greenhouse and have a look.
- I'll come along.

848
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:52,059
- You don't have to.
- I'm going anyway.

849
01:17:55,397 --> 01:17:57,797
- What's her name?
- Florence.

850
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,800
- Do you know where Fifine is?
- Yes.

851
01:18:01,002 --> 01:18:02,697
- Do you know where Fifine is?
- Yes.

852
01:18:02,904 --> 01:18:04,735
Go and get it.

853
01:18:05,006 --> 01:18:07,031
Let's go. Go and get her.

854
01:18:07,242 --> 01:18:09,870
Tell her brother wants to see her.
Let's go!

855
01:19:28,490 --> 01:19:29,514
Fifine?

856
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:42,703
Come along. Your brother is there.

857
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:57,038
Jean-Paul.

858
01:20:57,245 --> 01:20:58,906
Come on, Fifine.

859
01:21:01,650 --> 01:21:03,880
Were you playing
hide and seek?

860
01:21:04,085 --> 01:21:06,349
Don't make fun of me, Jean-Paul.

861
01:21:06,554 --> 01:21:08,385
I'm very unhappy.

862
01:21:09,257 --> 01:21:10,485
You know...

863
01:21:10,692 --> 01:21:14,287
when you play a game,
there is always a loser.

864
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:17,559
I've lost everything.

865
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,331
Not at all.

866
01:21:21,036 --> 01:21:22,867
It was a joke.

867
01:21:23,405 --> 01:21:26,966
- So don't cry.
- Please prepare the lilac room...

868
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:28,836
for Mr. Jean-Paul.

869
01:21:29,044 --> 01:21:31,604
- What tone is that?
- Run it.

870
01:21:31,813 --> 01:21:35,112
You don't lose
by waiting, you know?

871
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:39,620
Leave them.
They don't need us anymore.

872
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:44,918
Miléna.

873
01:21:46,661 --> 01:21:48,424
Do you have one for me?

874
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:04,371
The first cigarette
after the scare...

875
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:06,046
is the best.

876
01:22:06,247 --> 01:22:09,648
No. The best is after love.

877
01:22:09,851 --> 01:22:11,250
Yes.

878
01:22:12,187 --> 01:22:13,882
And with you.

879
01:22:14,389 --> 01:22:16,186
With you.
