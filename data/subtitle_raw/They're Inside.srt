1
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,512
- Without you watching this
video,

2
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:16,348
my life would be without
purpose.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,516
So depressing.

4
00:00:21,288 --> 00:00:23,522
Firstly, I just want to say
thank you,

5
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:26,358
thank you so much for...

6
00:00:29,597 --> 00:00:30,429
Gah, cunt.

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,262
Hey, guys, how you guys doing
tonight?

8
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,131
Louie here.

9
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:34,233
First things, first.

10
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,667
Happy New Year!

11
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,736
I'm just so blooming excited.

12
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,072
I feel like I should be
drinking champagne or something

13
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:43,342
in this video, or dropping
like a miniature ball.

14
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:45,461
Yeah, that's great.

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,579
A graphic of ball dropping.

16
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,481
Put my face on it maybe.

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,816
Yeah, I like that.

18
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:54,386
...For watching as always,
but especially today

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,687
because...

20
00:00:57,324 --> 00:00:58,590
Can't find the fucking...

21
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,727
Because, drum roll!

22
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,097
Yesterday we hit our goal
of 4 million subscribers!

23
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:09,234
You guys really are the
best, but now, as promised,

24
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,803
on to my annual New Year's post.

25
00:01:10,805 --> 00:01:12,738
It's the second so you've
gotta give me credit

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,107
for getting it in before Good
Friday.

27
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:17,810
Add the graphics.

28
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:18,744
Celebratory music.

29
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:21,580
Um.

30
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,848
Yeah, that's it.

31
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:29,321
Alright so, first
question is from Mildred.

32
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:31,390
Oh, Mildred.

33
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,258
That's my Mum's name.

34
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,463
Wait, Mum, is that you?

35
00:01:37,465 --> 00:01:39,631
Alright, so what's your
New Year's revolution?

36
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:44,203
What?

37
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,438
It's two o'clock in the morning.

38
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,406
Then...

39
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,809
Come on, wake up, dude!

40
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,714
Think, hot coffee.

41
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,183
Cold water!

42
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:00,285
Cold water!

43
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:01,353
Ah.

44
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:06,859
So, Mildred asks what's
your New Year's resolution?

45
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:08,160
Well, Mildred.

46
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,632
I'll be tackling cooking this
year.

47
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,601
My girlfriend got me this
slow cooker for Christmas

48
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,604
and I intend to slowly cook a
lot.

49
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:20,772
I actually signed up for a class

50
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:22,774
'cause I have no idea
how to cut vegetables

51
00:02:22,776 --> 00:02:24,309
and that was completely rubbish

52
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,245
so you can cut that last line.

53
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,549
For me, if the first step
isn't remove from package

54
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:32,384
and the second step isn't put in
microwave

55
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,920
then I have no idea what I'm
doing so.

56
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,890
I signed up for a class
because I don't have any idea

57
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,391
how to use a knife.

58
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,259
- I do!

59
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,627
- Yo, what the fuck!

60
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,920
Okay, no, no, no, no, please,
please.

61
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:15,694
- Wait.

62
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:32,744
Action.

63
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,697
- Can we watch it?

64
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,269
- Ah.
- Finally!

65
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:58,337
- Wow.

66
00:03:58,339 --> 00:03:59,571
- We're here!
- I love it.

67
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:00,906
- This place is huge!

68
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,407
- Yes.
- It's cozy, right?

69
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,709
- Stop.

70
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,244
- It looks kinda haunted.
- Come on.

71
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:05,944
- I'm just kidding.

72
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:06,812
- I tried.

73
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:08,163
- It's not haunted.

74
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,513
- Of course not.
- Look, we have a lion.

75
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:10,482
- Not bad, right?
- One lion.

76
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,017
Only one lion?

77
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,518
- Do you know if it's in
operation or not?

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,686
- Oh my God, Doogie.

79
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,355
- I'm all right.

80
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,823
- Sorry, Doug.

81
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,290
- How 'bout, no, accidents on
day one.

82
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:20,325
- I should probably--
- Chill out.

83
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,510
- Yeah.

84
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:22,694
I'll get down, I'll get down.

85
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:24,296
- They gave me a key.
- What do you think?

86
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,430
- No, clearly I do.

87
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,182
- It's unlocked.

88
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,933
Yeah, they gave me a
key, but it's not, look.

89
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:29,801
- Okay.
- Well, let's check it out.

90
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:31,336
- How very inviting, huh?

91
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:32,588
- Right.

92
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:33,839
- Welcome, welcome to
Cribs!

93
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,407
Some stranger's house.

94
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:38,510
We got this chest from
the deck of the Titanic

95
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,413
and we keep our most valuable...

96
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:43,448
...pine cones.

97
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,952
This chandelier also from... the
Titanic.

98
00:04:47,655 --> 00:04:50,689
Wicker basket, you guessed
it, from the Titanic.

99
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,324
And...

100
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,593
What the fuck?

101
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,596
This lamp, it looks like a lamp,

102
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:00,399
but it's actually a tiny house.

103
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:02,868
What?

104
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,604
I can't even, with these
paintings?

105
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:18,450
And now our most exquisite room.

106
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,557
- Whatcha you doin'?

107
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,958
- It's locked.

108
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,860
- Yeah, probably for good
reason.

109
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,662
Wanna come help us unload?

110
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:31,596
Chop chop!

111
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,919
- Hey.

112
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,737
I feel like Belle from
Beauty and the Beast.

113
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,673
- Well, you definitely
look more like the beast.

114
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,091
- You're gonna cringe at the
joke

115
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,508
when you're going through
the footage later.

116
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,678
- Hey, Aaron, will you help
get the food from the car,

117
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,080
and then start dinner with
Joanna?

118
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,481
Me and Doug will take care of
gear.

119
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,683
- You don't want a
man to do the heavy lifting?

120
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,485
- Uh, no, she wants
a man to do the cooking

121
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,720
and cleaning, Belle.

122
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,355
- Okay.

123
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,656
Now, that just makes you look
stupid

124
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:01,059
because Belle had like an
army of ka-ramic slaves

125
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,961
doing everything for her.

126
00:06:02,963 --> 00:06:04,012
Uh huh.

127
00:06:04,013 --> 00:06:05,062
- Do you mean ceramic?

128
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,634
- All done?

129
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:11,403
- Um, yes and no.

130
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,438
- What do you mean?

131
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,407
- Well, it means nobody's home,
Robin.

132
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:16,908
Doesn't matter how many
of these I drop off.

133
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,110
- Yeah, I mean, but a lot
of the scenes are at night.

134
00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,612
We can't be getting--

135
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,113
- Well, I know but this is a
winter town

136
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:22,614
and it's summer so the people
who probably own these homes

137
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:24,583
are at their beach houses or
something.

138
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:26,385
- Yeah, but if we get
interruptions and we're supposed--

139
00:06:26,387 --> 00:06:28,587
- We won't get any interruptions,
are you kidding me?

140
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,589
- Uh, guys, they left a note.

141
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:32,090
Ready?

142
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:33,425
Cody, you ready, okay.

143
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:36,628
Dear cast and crew of Lover's
Weekend,

144
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,063
hope the trip was safe.

145
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,866
We left a case of beers in the
fridge.

146
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,718
Yes!

147
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:44,569
May your journey toward truth
take you

148
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,871
to unexpected places.

149
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,539
Sincerely, the Havermans.

150
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,409
P.S., we don't internet,
service is shoddy,

151
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,611
but house phone works.

152
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:55,680
And there's a quote at the
bottom, which I'll let you read.

153
00:06:55,682 --> 00:06:58,984
- "What is filmmaking
but groping in the dark?"

154
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:00,085
Alexander Payne.

155
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,028
Ugh, so much fuzz.
- Got a hair on there?

156
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,096
I don't think, anyone's gonna
see that.

157
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,197
- I wanna look.
- Robin.

158
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,799
- I wanna look put together!

159
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,784
- You always look put
together.

160
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:17,768
It's like your life is put
together.

161
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,703
- Thank you.

162
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,172
- You shoot your
first feature tomorrow.

163
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,774
- Mm-hmm.
- Tell me about it.

164
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:27,045
- Okay, yeah, so it's about
me and my boyfriend, both.

165
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,780
Well, my boyfriend, it's about
both of us.

166
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,998
It's about.

167
00:07:29,999 --> 00:07:31,215
Sorry, okay, I'm gonna
start again, I can't...

168
00:07:31,218 --> 00:07:32,651
- You are awful at this.

169
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,119
- I'm really bad at pitching,
okay.

170
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:35,804
- Yeah, clearly.
- Okay.

171
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:37,488
- Your husband
is your only investor.

172
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,924
- Hey, hey, hey, don't spoil the
movie.

173
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:41,026
- Binny, this is a
behind-the-scenes documentary.

174
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,162
If someone watches this
like before the actual film

175
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,831
they're sociopaths.

176
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,499
- Still I have to explain
the plot first so.

177
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:48,617
Context.

178
00:07:48,618 --> 00:07:49,734
- Yeah, I'm painfully
aware of that fact.

179
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,903
- Okay, okay, geez.

180
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:54,673
So this movie is about a
long weekend that I spent

181
00:07:54,675 --> 00:07:57,042
with my boyfriend at the time.

182
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,543
Now husband.

183
00:07:58,545 --> 00:07:59,511
- Ooh.

184
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,579
- I'm getting to...

185
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:01,646
I'm gettin' to the bones.

186
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,582
Okay.

187
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,517
- Good morning.
- Jesus.

188
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,718
Oh, you scared me.

189
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,821
You found Cody's camera.

190
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,224
Well, she was interested in

191
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,758
behind-the-scenes footage.

192
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:15,694
Might be useful.

193
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:19,097
You okay?

194
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:20,866
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

195
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,634
Just trying to be helpful.

196
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:26,705
- That's all you've been doing.

197
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:29,608
None of this would be
possible without you.

198
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,909
I very much appreciate it.

199
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,012
That feels surprisingly nice.

200
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,248
You are one lucky woman.

201
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,102
- Now go on.

202
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,920
You said I could paint
without any distractions.

203
00:08:43,473 --> 00:08:45,023
But he actually found
out both of his parents

204
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,225
were killed on a car
crash on Christmas day.

205
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,694
And, yeah, we got snowed
in that day and, anyway.

206
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,831
Secrets were shared and like,
our relationship evolved.

207
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,666
It was, yeah, it was, you know.

208
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,834
And then more time.

209
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,001
- Tell them about the
house.

210
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:57,869
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

211
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,255
We won a contest.

212
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:02,640
Yeah, um, this film, this
couple they love film

213
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:06,177
or whatever and they ran
a contest for a filmmaker

214
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,179
to come and shoot at their
winter home.

215
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,749
I just had to write about
my passion for film.

216
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,651
- They didn't want
to know about the film?

217
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,953
- No, I wrote a little about it
but,

218
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,254
no, they wanted to know about
the filmmaker, specifically.

219
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:19,224
- What'd you write about?

220
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,725
- I don't really remember.

221
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,294
Kinda just did it on a whim, you
know?

222
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,328
I didn't think.
- Ooh.

223
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,796
Just did it on a whim!

224
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,164
- Oh yeah.
- No big deal.

225
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,032
Brush it off the shoulders.

226
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,133
- Yeah.

227
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,801
- Okay, introduce the
crew.

228
00:09:29,803 --> 00:09:30,735
- Okay, yeah.

229
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,455
- There's Aaron.

230
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,339
He's very um, passionate about
his craft.

231
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,108
He's a friend from college.

232
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,945
- I was 15 and my buddy
pulls out this photo

233
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:43,014
and it's literally a picture
of a penguin's butthole

234
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,783
that's taking a poop.
- What?

235
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,685
- And he drew little eyes on
top of it and a little mouth.

236
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,853
- Gross.
- And it looks like a little.

237
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,855
- How do you even
find a penguin butthole

238
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,257
to take a picture?

239
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,126
- And then there's
Joanna.

240
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,994
And she doesn't look
anything like me, obviously,

241
00:09:55,996 --> 00:09:57,228
but she had the best performance

242
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,130
and I really wanted to cast
based on that.

243
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:01,232
She was, oh, she was awesome.

244
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:04,035
And then there's Doogie, or
Doug.

245
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,171
I guess he
insists on being called now.

246
00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:08,773
We have known him since
kindergarten, mm-hmm.

247
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,042
Forever.

248
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,310
And then there's you,
my sweet baby sister.

249
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,879
- Mm.

250
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,048
- Rockin' the behind-the-scenes.

251
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,083
And that's it.

252
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:19,384
Yeah, we're small.

253
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,852
- Sweet, okay.

254
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,154
Um, I think I'm gonna take this
audio

255
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,356
and then I'm gonna lay it over
the footage

256
00:10:24,358 --> 00:10:25,858
that we got in the van this
morning.

257
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,359
I think that will look pretty
cool.

258
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:28,994
- Okay.

259
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,261
- You don't like that.

260
00:10:30,263 --> 00:10:31,696
- I said okay.

261
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,130
- Yeah, but you made the
face.

262
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:33,999
- What face?

263
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,417
I didn't make a face.

264
00:10:35,418 --> 00:10:36,834
- No, you make the
face that Mom always makes

265
00:10:36,837 --> 00:10:38,487
when she thinks I'm making...
- Okay.

266
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:40,138
- Bad choices.
- Well, you do that face too.

267
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,239
Plenty of times.

268
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,339
- So you admit you made
the face?

269
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,241
- Oh shit.

270
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:45,110
Caught in a lie.

271
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,911
I'll look at it, but, I don't
know.

272
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,213
It kinda feels a little hokey.

273
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,132
Don't you think?

274
00:10:50,133 --> 00:10:52,050
My thoughts on documentary
are a little more, you know,

275
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,885
like Maysles' brothers.

276
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,719
Like let the story just kind of
happen.

277
00:10:55,722 --> 00:10:56,855
Don't like, try to.

278
00:10:56,857 --> 00:10:58,523
- What story?

279
00:10:58,524 --> 00:11:00,190
I'm not trying to shoot some
award winning documentary here.

280
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,960
I'm just trying to get some,
like bonus

281
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,728
feature DVD kind of stuff.

282
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,198
- Well, I don't know.

283
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:07,232
I thought your perspective
on the whole thing

284
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,266
would be really interesting.

285
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:09,901
Maybe you wanna explore that.

286
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,204
- Why explore
something so disturbing?

287
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:19,444
No, but seriously, get my
camera away from the water.

288
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,146
I am terrified!

289
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:22,847
That is my soul you're holding,
come on.

290
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,948
Can you get me a beer?

291
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,866
No, no!

292
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:25,783
Get that way from the hot tub.

293
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:27,018
- Never!

294
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,720
- That's my baby!

295
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:30,221
- Come on! Speech!

296
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,222
- Hey, are you ready, are you
ready?

297
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,222
- Yes, ready, thank you.
- Yes, yes.

298
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:35,060
- Alright.

299
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:37,896
Okay, first I would like to
thank everyone for being here.

300
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,966
Having you all here
couldn't make me happier.

301
00:11:41,968 --> 00:11:43,034
No I really, seriously,

302
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,869
I couldn't spare a single one of
you.

303
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:48,807
You're a part of something
that I really believe in

304
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,209
and I think, hopefully,
you believe in too.

305
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,044
- Don't cry.

306
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:55,246
- I'm not, it's the water!

307
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,382
- I need to get through this.

308
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,416
- Okay, shh.

309
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:01,252
- No, this is, this is...

310
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:04,155
You have no idea how
important it is for me

311
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,573
to tell this story.

312
00:12:05,574 --> 00:12:06,990
And you guys are each doing
like four or five jobs

313
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:11,062
and that's to help me get to
tell it so.

314
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,048
Just, thank you.

315
00:12:13,049 --> 00:12:15,033
From the bottom of my
heart, so much gratitude.

316
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,835
- We appreciate you--
- Cheers!

317
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,303
- Cheers!

318
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,941
- What is that?

319
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,021
Joanna, you awake?

320
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,991
First shot of the moviola!

321
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,165
- You like the makeshift
dolly I have for the scene?

322
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,534
- It's all right,
it's a little sketchy.

323
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:25,069
Look how into it she is.

324
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,754
Prepped.

325
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:28,438
Letting nothing infringe on her
focus.

326
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,574
- Grab the boom please.

327
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,842
- Yes!
- Thank you.

328
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:31,910
Let's do it.

329
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,545
- Okay, okay, okay.

330
00:13:33,547 --> 00:13:34,813
Rolling.

331
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,414
- Scene 17, take one.

332
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:43,588
Action.

333
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:50,962
- Wow.

334
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:53,832
- You like it?

335
00:13:55,202 --> 00:13:56,234
- It's beautiful.

336
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:59,003
Must have cost a fortune.

337
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:01,306
- We never get away and I
thought...

338
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:04,375
Shit, line!

339
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:05,343
- Cut.

340
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:06,344
- Okay.

341
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,048
- Wow.

342
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,884
- You like it?

343
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,252
- It's beautiful.

344
00:14:15,322 --> 00:14:17,272
It must have cost a fortune.

345
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,223
- Well, we've never really
been on vacation before.

346
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,258
- Okay, back to one.

347
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,492
- Seriously?

348
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:23,211
- Did I say the wrong line?

349
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,528
- Yeah, no, it's not a huge
deal.

350
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:28,933
I like the tone, but that
wording is really important--

351
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:29,601
- Cutting camera.

352
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:31,102
- I just couldn't sleep.

353
00:14:32,606 --> 00:14:34,372
- Yeah, was it that
noise?

354
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,475
- No, what noise?

355
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:41,112
- I don't know, just
something weird in the woods.

356
00:14:41,114 --> 00:14:42,447
But why couldn't you sleep?

357
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:47,185
- My friend from high
school died recently.

358
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,221
- Aaron, I'm so sorry.

359
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,491
- It was some undiagnosed
stomach issue.

360
00:14:53,493 --> 00:14:56,194
It just happened in his sleep.

361
00:14:56,196 --> 00:14:57,629
- Geez.

362
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,063
- What kind of
person do you have to be

363
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,599
to write a goodbye on
someone's Facebook wall?

364
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:05,036
Like to assume that there's an
afterlife

365
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,539
and that afterlife is so boring
the person

366
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,863
wants to check Facebook.

367
00:15:09,864 --> 00:15:11,186
- That's
what kept you up at night?

368
00:15:11,187 --> 00:15:12,509
That and my never ending

369
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:13,478
fear of mortality.

370
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,515
Wait, what was that noise you
were talking about before?

371
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,184
- Animal maybe?

372
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,219
- Doing what?

373
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,086
- I don't know.

374
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,321
- No, it's too repetitive.

375
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,089
It has to be human.

376
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,324
- Alright, guys, let's do this.

377
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,392
Let's get back to work.

378
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:28,459
- Well, I don't want
to freak you out but--

379
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,526
- Aaron, feeling better?

380
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,129
- Oh, yeah, yeah, much better.

381
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,030
Food really helped.

382
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33,348
- Awesome, sweet.

383
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,665
- It's not out of the
realm of possibility.

384
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:35,567
- Uh, hey, can we?

385
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:36,467
- It's a densely wooded area

386
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,602
they're known to be nocturnal.

387
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,270
- Doug, can we be good to go in
10?

388
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,538
- Yeah. That's fine.
- Awesome.

389
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,670
- You hear that?

390
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:56,954
- Yeah. It's louder this
time.

391
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,958
- It's that noise again.

392
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,696
Someone chopping wood.

393
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:05,730
- Really?

394
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:06,664
- Yeah.

395
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,667
- Who chops wood at 2AM?

396
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,104
- I don't know,
but that's what it is.

397
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:14,539
- How do you know?

398
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,708
- I grew up in the
mountains.

399
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:18,309
- Serious?
- Yeah.

400
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,177
- For some reason I
thought you

401
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:20,979
grew up in hotel.

402
00:16:21,614 --> 00:16:24,182
- Okay, no one grows up
in hotel.

403
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:26,384
- Tell that to the kid
from Dunston Checks In.

404
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:27,318
- Guys.

405
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,690
- I'm gonna say something.

406
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,559
- No, don't, no, no, no.

407
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,594
- Hey!

408
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,628
Do your chores during the
day like everyone else!

409
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,465
Hello?

410
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,568
Anyone out there?

411
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:46,704
- Seriously?

412
00:16:46,706 --> 00:16:48,506
Guys, we have to be up in three
hours.

413
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:52,510
- Sorry, man.

414
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,577
Well, good night, you fuckin'
weirdo.

415
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,651
- I mean, I like what he's
doing.

416
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,285
He's just trying to make it
naturalistic for his character.

417
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:03,654
- I know, and I trust you, I
really do.

418
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,089
I just think, you know, you
wrote

419
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:06,758
all these natural flourishes and
I just.

420
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,292
- I know the lines.

421
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,529
- I'm not saying that
you don't.

422
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,364
- That's not really the problem.

423
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,333
- Robin, Can we talk about
the mantle piece for a minute?

424
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:16,501
I just feel like it's a
little bare considering--

425
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,535
- I'm trying to talk to my
actors.

426
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,547
- But I'm taking about--

427
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:19,558
- You said you could do this.

428
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:20,569
- I said that we could do this.

429
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,117
- You need to get the cues so
that

430
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,662
she knows when to talk.
- I will, I'm gonna get 'em,

431
00:17:23,663 --> 00:17:25,207
- Oh great, now I look
like the difficult actress.

432
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,611
- Drama!

433
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:28,730
- Turn it off.

434
00:17:28,731 --> 00:17:30,414
- Ohhh, now I'm in the
drama!

435
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,516
- Turn it off!

436
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,058
- Hey, Cody, have you seen my
headphones?

437
00:17:40,794 --> 00:17:42,126
- No.

438
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,363
- Uh oh.

439
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,297
- What?

440
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:52,270
- Aaron and I just have very
different approaches to acting.

441
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:54,939
I'm classically trained and he--

442
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,607
- And he's like never
even heard of Stanislavsky?

443
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,112
- You said it, not me.

444
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:03,414
- Look, I'm trying to
decide if I wanna say this

445
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,549
on camera or not.

446
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:05,716
I think it's a compliment,
but...

447
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,986
- Oh, now you have to say
it.

448
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:12,255
- I read your sister's
script and... I just knew.

449
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,662
It's really honest.

450
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:20,465
It's really rare.

451
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:23,334
Are you okay with how honest it
is?

452
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,485
- Yeah, it's totally
fine.

453
00:18:24,486 --> 00:18:25,635
It's not a big deal.
- Yeah?

454
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:27,738
Because...

455
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,544
We shoot that scene tomorrow
and it's really intense.

456
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,179
I know you're gonna be watching.

457
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:36,814
- I guess I need to know
that you're gonna be

458
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:37,882
comfortable with it.

459
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,321
- Robin and I haven't
been talking for a while.

460
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,255
I don't know.

461
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:48,493
She kind of sent this script
as like an olive branch.

462
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,863
And you're right.

463
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,598
It was just brutally honest in
ways

464
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,633
that she had never been before.

465
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,869
So I'm not just okay with it.

466
00:18:57,871 --> 00:18:59,537
I'm happy it exists.

467
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:00,471
- Good.

468
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,875
'Cause I think it's gonna be
really good.

469
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,062
All right, I gotta get back in
there.

470
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,479
- Hey, I have an
extra pair of headphones

471
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,449
if you wanna use them.

472
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,583
- You do?
- Yeah.

473
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:13,451
- You're not using them?

474
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:14,852
- No.

475
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:15,720
- Thank you!

476
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:17,439
Okay, you're a life saver.

477
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,157
I have this playlist I
like to listen to before

478
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:19,891
to get me in...

479
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,726
- Not now, Cody.

480
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:22,894
- Mm, come on.

481
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,329
I gotta get your thoughts.

482
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,900
- My thoughts are that
we just lost half a day

483
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:30,768
from that argument and I
gotta figure out what scenes

484
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:32,470
we can lose to make up for it.

485
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:34,438
- If you don't wanna talk
about it,

486
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,509
I'm thinkin' that I should see
that essay.

487
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,128
- What essay?

488
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:41,746
- The one that you
wrote to get to this house.

489
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:43,465
I mean, like to win this.

490
00:19:43,466 --> 00:19:45,183
I was thinking that, you
know, if it's good enough

491
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,185
then I could read it out loud.

492
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,553
- No, no, no.
- Then I'm gonna cut it in

493
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:49,920
with the last--
- I don't have it any more.

494
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:51,287
- Well, it must be
in your email or something.

495
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,890
You must have it somewhere?
- Cody, no.

496
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,359
- I'll go talk to Doogie
then.

497
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,827
- Oh, can you not please?

498
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:00,431
He's finding all of
this very overwhelming.

499
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,368
- Well, if you
need someone else on set

500
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,870
why don't you just call your
husband?

501
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,605
I mean, Max is probably
available.

502
00:20:07,607 --> 00:20:09,540
- We're kind of on a break right
now.

503
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,614
No, not a break, we're just
using the time

504
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,282
apart to think about...

505
00:20:21,688 --> 00:20:22,620
Uh, will you delete that?

506
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:24,255
Actually, what I just said?

507
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,623
I shouldn't...

508
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,857
It's not what I meant.

509
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,209
- Yeah.

510
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,560
- Will you do it now please?

511
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,962
- Yeah, yeah, got you.

512
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,932
- Please, I don't want the
chance of him hearing it.

513
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,500
Will you just do it?

514
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,337
- Yeah, I'll delete it
right now.

515
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,016
- What the fuck are you doing?

516
00:20:54,854 --> 00:20:57,888
If something's wrong, I
said to come talk to me.

517
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:00,825
You know that.

518
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:02,026
- There's nothing wrong.

519
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,030
- Good.

520
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,833
I brought you something.

521
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:13,704
Where are your manners?

522
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:15,973
- Can I have it please?

523
00:21:19,545 --> 00:21:21,646
What did you bring me?

524
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,449
- Please and thank you.

525
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,618
- Thank you so much, it means a
lot.

526
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,054
- Okay, open it.

527
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,560
- Well, what is it?

528
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,029
- She's drawing now.

529
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:45,419
- Okay.

530
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,470
- You see, I think she still
loves you.

531
00:21:51,511 --> 00:21:53,044
- I don't know.

532
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,379
I mean, it's pretty verbatim.

533
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:57,448
- He actually said these things
to you?

534
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:00,518
- He was lashing out
at whoever was close to him.

535
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,603
- Okay.

536
00:22:01,604 --> 00:22:02,687
I mean, it just, it kinda
seems like he's being

537
00:22:02,689 --> 00:22:04,506
a bit condescending.

538
00:22:04,507 --> 00:22:06,324
- Yeah, his world just ended,
right?

539
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,793
His reactions are not gonna
be the normal Max reactions.

540
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:11,346
- Yeah.

541
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:13,898
- Hey, it's a pretty big scene
today.

542
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,700
I'm sure I can manage here
without you.

543
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,902
- No, no, no, no,
I want to help, Doug.

544
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:19,870
- Alright.

545
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,640
In that case I gotta put
a bigger light in here

546
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,752
if you wouldn't mind.

547
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:24,863
- Oh yeah, of course.
- Yeah?

548
00:22:24,864 --> 00:22:25,974
Just need to give it a little
tug here

549
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:28,646
and you should be good.

550
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:29,680
- Ooh, pro.

551
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,849
- Like a pro.

552
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,668
- Hey, you okay?

553
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:35,486
- Yeah, yeah, I was just
helping him Doog-- Doug

554
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,521
- Mind if I use your camera?

555
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,389
I wanna get a second angle.

556
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,056
- Yeah, of course.

557
00:22:39,058 --> 00:22:40,091
- Thank you.

558
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:43,027
Action.

559
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,863
- I need you to be open right
now, Robin.

560
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:46,797
For me.

561
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,968
I can't handle this
emotional shutdown, okay?

562
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,770
If you have something to say to
me,

563
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,873
if you have something to tell
me then just fucking say it!

564
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:08,753
- My Dad would molest my
sister in front of me.

565
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:09,687
- What?

566
00:23:11,157 --> 00:23:13,791
- He would say if you tell on
anyone

567
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,659
then I'll do the same thing to
you.

568
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:19,897
He made me stay in the room
every time.

569
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,099
I think just to keep the fear
fresh.

570
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,705
It worked 'cause you're the
first person I'm telling.

571
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,912
And the only reason it stopped

572
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:36,881
is because he died of a heart
attack.

573
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,653
He would make me turn
on a movie full volume

574
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:43,854
I think, so my Mom couldn't
here.

575
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,960
I should have stopped it, I
should have...

576
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,766
- You're disgusting.

577
00:23:58,704 --> 00:23:59,570
- What?

578
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,122
- How?

579
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:02,673
How could you let that piece
of shit even do that to her?

580
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,742
How could you let him?

581
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:07,278
Are you fucking kidding me?

582
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,012
- Someone's at the door.

583
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,746
- Cody, we're gonna look nuts
if we answer with a camera.

584
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,916
Hey, don't say anything, okay?

585
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,051
No macho confrontational
bullshit.

586
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:20,224
Evening.

587
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,625
- Good evening.

588
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,894
You're not the Havermans.

589
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:24,962
- No, no, we aren't,

590
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,764
but they're letting us film
here.

591
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,102
- I forgot my air freshener
here.

592
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,905
- We're making a movie.

593
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,212
- Oh.

594
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,881
- Hey, um, where's your
car?

595
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,984
- Is it pornography?

596
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,687
- What, no, no, it's
not.

597
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:50,988
It's um...

598
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,491
No, it's a drama.

599
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:58,529
- My husband wanted to
apologize for the other night.

600
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,100
He doesn't sleep well like you
and I.

601
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,871
- The chopping sound.

602
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,572
- Oh.
- Yes.

603
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,207
He chops wood.

604
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:13,844
He has anxiety.

605
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:16,580
- Who doesn't?

606
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:19,550
- I don't.

607
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:26,123
- I don't mean to be
like weird,

608
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:28,859
but we were just in the
middle of shooting a scene.

609
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,730
- Quite all right.

610
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,265
I should get going anyhow.

611
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:37,735
I have a long day tomorrow.

612
00:25:38,804 --> 00:25:40,237
- A long day.

613
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,239
Well, you're welcome to
come to our wrap party.

614
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,608
And we'd love to meet
your husband as well.

615
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,250
- Nice to see y'all.

616
00:25:54,287 --> 00:25:56,720
- Thanks, have a nice night.

617
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:02,026
You filmed that whole thing,
didn't you?

618
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:03,761
- What's wrong with her?

619
00:26:05,264 --> 00:26:06,864
- Ugh, let's
just shoot this scene.

620
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:09,333
I cannot do another 14-hour day.

621
00:26:09,335 --> 00:26:10,768
- Let's do this.

622
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,724
Hey.

623
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:35,993
- Hey.

624
00:26:35,995 --> 00:26:37,595
What are you doin'?

625
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:38,996
- Just helping out a little.

626
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:43,033
Well, I mean, it was a pretty
intense day, don't ya think?

627
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,269
- Yeah.

628
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,038
Yeah, that woman really creeped
me out.

629
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,610
- I mean, she was a little weird
but like.

630
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,347
I meant like the work we
did today... do you wanna--

631
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:57,848
- that scene.

632
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,249
- Have you locked the doors?

633
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,320
I don't feel comfortable with
her around.

634
00:27:03,322 --> 00:27:04,722
You know what I mean?

635
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,092
- Cody, I wanna talk about that
scene.

636
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,296
- I really think we should lock
the doors.

637
00:27:19,905 --> 00:27:23,007
- I mean, is that really
what's bothering you?

638
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:27,711
That was like some heavy stuff,
you know?

639
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:38,355
What?

640
00:27:45,331 --> 00:27:46,697
- Hey.

641
00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,431
- It's closer.

642
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,769
I'm gonna tell him to move, at
least.

643
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:57,975
Hey, man, you're scaring people!

644
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,910
You mind going closer to your
house?

645
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:07,451
You're first...

646
00:28:07,453 --> 00:28:10,120
- What did he just say?

647
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,696
- What the hell?

648
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:20,364
- Are you fucking kidding
me?

649
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:22,166
- Give me the camera.
- Aaron, don't--

650
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:24,468
- I'm gonna stop this shit.
- Don't!

651
00:28:34,113 --> 00:28:35,279
- Got me chasing through
the woods

652
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:37,181
in my fuckin' boxers!

653
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,230
Show yourself, man.

654
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,365
What the fuck?

655
00:30:01,367 --> 00:30:02,366
- Aaron!

656
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,474
- What's wrong?

657
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:13,944
What happened?

658
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,079
- Someone--someone's inside.

659
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:18,916
- Take this.

660
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,265
Stop recording.

661
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:38,368
Goodnight, see you in
the mornin'

662
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,838
- I'm not sleeping
tonight.

663
00:31:02,228 --> 00:31:03,894
- They had to be
gluten-free too.

664
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:05,561
- I'm telling you, someone
just didn't close the door

665
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,864
and a critter walked in.

666
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,165
- Okay, how can an animal open a
fridge?

667
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:15,255
This isn't funny.

668
00:31:15,256 --> 00:31:17,406
- You don't know what could
be or could possibly not be.

669
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,042
She said she saw something and
it may be,

670
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,002
I don't know.

671
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,961
We could go to town, I mean,
like,

672
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:21,920
maybe this is like a thing here.

673
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,879
- No, we can't do that.

674
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:24,615
We're losing so much day light.

675
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:25,482
- Are you...

676
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:26,516
Are you filming right now?

677
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,319
Will you excuse us for a second?

678
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,596
You just
can't turn it off, can you?

679
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:41,014
- What?

680
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:42,431
- This gross invasion of my
privacy.

681
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,201
- Cody, calm down, all right.

682
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,719
Just chill out for a second.

683
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,236
- This is all like a setup,
isn't it?

684
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,172
- You wanted to be a part of
this project.

685
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,475
I am trying to help you.

686
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,644
- Then stop filming me.

687
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,580
- You know, I think you're
just...

688
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,115
You're reacting to the emotional
stress

689
00:31:58,117 --> 00:31:59,216
of yesterday's scene.

690
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,188
- I cannot believe you just said
that.

691
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:08,625
- What?

692
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,464
- When I read your script it
felt like,

693
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:17,401
like you were finally
admitting what you did wrong.

694
00:32:17,403 --> 00:32:18,335
- I was.

695
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,241
- I am catching you filming
me, manipulating me.

696
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,276
- What, are you hearing
yourself?

697
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:27,411
That's crazy.

698
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,219
- I mean, it's written
in the script, isn't it?

699
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,487
- What, what, I don't know
what you're talking ab--

700
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,256
- So stupid, so...

701
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:42,960
- What the fuck?

702
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,394
- You're the fucking
protagonist!

703
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,496
You're taking this, this very
real thing

704
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:50,200
that happened to me and
you're taking my real emotions

705
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,336
and you're using it to exploit
me.

706
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,672
To tell your story.

707
00:32:56,742 --> 00:32:57,674
- Hey.

708
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,044
Come here, sit down.

709
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:05,082
That is...

710
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,583
- You don't even care about me.

711
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,521
- I'm sorry.

712
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,692
That's not true.

713
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:17,461
I do care.

714
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:20,764
I...

715
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:22,199
I thought I was helping.

716
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:26,336
I'm not good at this.

717
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:29,673
What can I do?

718
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,447
- Nothing.

719
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,018
I don't know, I don't know.

720
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,487
This doesn't feel right.

721
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:45,455
Like everything's wrong here.

722
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:47,324
Like it's like.

723
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,192
It's the woman and it's the
fridge

724
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:50,794
and the noises at night, you
don't...

725
00:33:50,796 --> 00:33:52,295
You weren't there, you don't--

726
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,463
- Listen.

727
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:54,998
What is it that you think we
should do?

728
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,532
I mean, what makes you feel
better about all of this.

729
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,957
I hear you--

730
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,380
- Let's just call the cops.

731
00:33:59,381 --> 00:34:00,803
- Cody, I'm not trying to be a
bitch,

732
00:34:00,806 --> 00:34:02,305
but they're gonna laugh in our
face.

733
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:04,107
I mean, what are we saying to
them?

734
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,343
- I know, but if, but if I...

735
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:08,211
- Hey, okay.

736
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,646
I have an idea.

737
00:34:09,648 --> 00:34:10,680
We have a full day of filming
today,

738
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:12,399
but when we're done--

739
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,117
- why don't we go into
town, we'll get some dinner.

740
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:16,119
We'll relax a little bit.

741
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:17,337
We'll get out of the house.

742
00:34:17,338 --> 00:34:18,554
I think, I think the isolation
is just

743
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,324
getting to you a little bit,
okay?

744
00:34:21,326 --> 00:34:22,259
- Okay.

745
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:28,231
- Like all your
problems have melted away.

746
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,533
For the moment, at least.

747
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,738
Good, perfect.

748
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,123
Cut!

749
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:37,507
Gorgeous, let's do it one more
time.

750
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:38,742
- A little lower.

751
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:39,643
- Lower, lower, lower.

752
00:34:40,813 --> 00:34:42,512
- Still don't know you manage to
do this.

753
00:34:42,514 --> 00:34:44,147
- Oh yeah, how's chore prison

754
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:45,432
over there, Doogster?

755
00:34:45,433 --> 00:34:46,716
- That should be you!

756
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,786
- No, I thought, I...
- Oh, here it comes.

757
00:34:49,788 --> 00:34:52,089
- I don't know, I just thought
when you said the window

758
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:53,790
doesn't come back up...
- That I was joking.

759
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,858
- I didn't...

760
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,112
- That's hilarious.

761
00:34:59,113 --> 00:35:00,796
- Listen, he saved the day
and you almost ruined it.

762
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:02,332
When that waitress looked at you
like...

763
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:03,467
- Oh, yes.

764
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:04,601
- That was not even my
fault.

765
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,220
She was just crazy.

766
00:35:06,221 --> 00:35:07,838
- Wait, tell the story
again.

767
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,573
- No, no, no, God, please don't.

768
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:11,274
Don't, do not.
- No.

769
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,676
We can't retell that story.

770
00:35:12,678 --> 00:35:14,111
- Why, I wanna it
for the behind the scenes.

771
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,545
- Honestly, Cody, you had to be
there.

772
00:35:15,547 --> 00:35:17,347
It would be awkward to retell
that story.

773
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:19,282
- Hey, keep that thing rolling.

774
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,650
Behind the scenes.
- Shit.

775
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,752
Sorry, you missed it kiddo.

776
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,223
- Hey, by the way,

777
00:35:26,225 --> 00:35:27,691
how you feelin'?

778
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:29,009
- Good.

779
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,326
Town was not as far away as I
thought.

780
00:35:30,329 --> 00:35:31,261
- Yeah.

781
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,296
Told ya.

782
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:36,466
And, guys, I think I got it.

783
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,436
- Look at that!

784
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:40,503
- I owe this bastard five bucks.

785
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,372
- Oh my God.

786
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:12,562
- Morning.

787
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,530
- Morning.

788
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,931
- Oh, the room was very br--

789
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,835
- Everything all right?

790
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,403
- Yeah, the phone's not working.

791
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,504
- What?

792
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:23,273
- It's probably nothing.

793
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,844
- You trying Morse code.

794
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,847
- Sorry, just, I haven't
talked to my husband

795
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:31,781
since I got here.

796
00:37:32,851 --> 00:37:34,167
I don't know, it's not fair.

797
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,484
All he's done for me, I just.

798
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:37,954
I want everything to be okay,
you know?

799
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,889
- It's okay, um.

800
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:40,824
Yeah, I'll go town.

801
00:37:40,826 --> 00:37:42,342
I'll call him.

802
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,859
And then I'll find someone that
can

803
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:46,263
fix the phone and bring
him back here, okay?

804
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:47,297
- Yeah.

805
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:48,498
Thanks.

806
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,733
- Focus on the movie.

807
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,401
- Yeah.

808
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,602
- You know we could...

809
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:53,670
We could...

810
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:58,475
We could do the scene, the
parent scene.

811
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:01,678
That way Joanna could, she could
help.

812
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,647
- Yeah, that's a good
idea.

813
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,915
- 35,000 feet in the air and
dropping,

814
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:06,983
there's nothing you can do.

815
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,953
And that makes it far worse.

816
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:11,905
- My mic keeps falling.

817
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:12,955
- The car doesn't start.

818
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:14,624
- Oh, whoa, what do you
mean?

819
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,660
- What the fuck did I
just say?

820
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:19,429
The car, it does not fucking
start.

821
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:20,530
- You're okay, we're all
okay.

822
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,565
- I mean, we've got a broken
phone.

823
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,434
We have crazy neighbors.

824
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:26,302
I mean, how does no one else
see that this is an issue?

825
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:26,970
- Let's just calm down.

826
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,004
- Fuck you.

827
00:38:28,006 --> 00:38:29,472
Turn it off.

828
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,641
No more fucking cameras.

829
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,951
- Here, drink this.

830
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,386
- We have to do something.

831
00:38:43,388 --> 00:38:44,421
- Cody, I know you're
worried,

832
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:45,955
but it's probably nothing.

833
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,891
- I don't wanna be stuck here,
Robin.

834
00:38:47,893 --> 00:38:49,592
- We won't be.

835
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:51,695
- Yeah, the car definitely isn't
working.

836
00:38:53,031 --> 00:38:54,964
- Guys, this is probably a
coincidence,

837
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,334
a random series of events.

838
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,501
Trust me, I don't like that the
car's

839
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,803
not working either, but.

840
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,871
- This is more than just
some stupid phone call

841
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:04,691
to your fucking husband.

842
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:07,510
I mean, I feel like, like,
like something bad's happening.

843
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:09,346
- Could you tell what
was wrong with the car?

844
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:10,847
- No.

845
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,483
- Well, did someone tamper with
it?

846
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,751
Did someone break something?

847
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,386
- Wait, why would anyone do
that?

848
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,355
- I mean, look, I'm not a huge
car guy,

849
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,457
but all the obvious things are
fine.

850
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,759
- Robin, I'm really freaked out.

851
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:23,960
- Listen, I'll just walk to
town.

852
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:25,061
- No, Doug, we need you here.

853
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,896
You're my DP.

854
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,431
Once Cody calms down...

855
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:29,933
- I'm not gonna calm
down.

856
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,434
- Look, okay, I get it,
I see your point of view.

857
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:32,569
Listen, that's why I gotta go.

858
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,037
You need your actors here.

859
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,504
Cody's in no shape to go
anywhere.

860
00:39:35,505 --> 00:39:36,971
Let's be honest, you can still
shoot something without me.

861
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:37,974
- I wanna go to town.

862
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,843
- Well, then fucking go, okay!

863
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,745
- Don't talk to her that
way.

864
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:46,116
- I'm sorry, I didn't.

865
00:39:46,118 --> 00:39:47,817
We're just so far behind.

866
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:51,421
I feel like this is my one
chance and I'm blowing it.

867
00:39:51,423 --> 00:39:52,155
- Oh, you mean I'm
blowing it.

868
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:53,089
- No, God.

869
00:39:53,091 --> 00:39:54,624
Cody, I don't--
- Come on.

870
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:58,995
Look.

871
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,435
Robin, I know that you think
that Cody's overreacting here.

872
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,970
I mean, but not having a car or
a phone.

873
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,138
I mean, what if there's an
accident?

874
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,639
- Yeah, I know, but I need you
here.

875
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,507
- Listen, you have the shot
list.

876
00:40:10,509 --> 00:40:11,174
You'll be fine.

877
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,012
Robin, Cody is scared!

878
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,479
And when we were kids I saw
her scared and I did nothing.

879
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,983
And I won't let that happen
again.

880
00:40:22,187 --> 00:40:23,586
Look, it should take me
about an hour and a half

881
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:24,988
to get to town and I don't know
how long

882
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,890
to find a tow truck after that.

883
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,805
Look, everything's gonna be all
right.

884
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,513
Town's not that far, remember?

885
00:40:50,515 --> 00:40:51,448
- Yeah.

886
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,017
- Come here.

887
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:24,113
- I know that you're kicking off
customers

888
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:26,883
for fucking employees.

889
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,485
No, listen to me, asshole!

890
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:29,953
I need to get on that fucking
plane

891
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:32,655
because my parents are fucking
dead!

892
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,524
No, don't you fucking dare.

893
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,626
I'm gonna get on that fucking
plane, you understand me?

894
00:41:36,628 --> 00:41:38,995
I need to be there, I
need to fucking be there!

895
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:41,164
Fuck you!

896
00:41:45,237 --> 00:41:46,536
Mother fucker!

897
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,513
Okay, what the fuck?

898
00:41:59,017 --> 00:41:59,949
- A rock.

899
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:02,519
- What is it?

900
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:11,694
"Give them pleasure, the
same pleasure they have

901
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,797
"when waking up from a
nightmare?"

902
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:16,032
Alfred Hitchcock.

903
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:21,004
- Was this you?

904
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,841
- What?

905
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:26,175
- Is this you, are you doing
this?

906
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:28,244
Are you fucking with me?

907
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:32,282
- No, I would never.

908
00:42:32,284 --> 00:42:34,617
- You're taking advantage.

909
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:38,121
This is all for some fucking
documentary about me, isn't it?

910
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:40,723
- Cody, there are no cameras
running.

911
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:42,091
- You want me to act out.

912
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,560
You want me to freak out.

913
00:42:43,562 --> 00:42:45,194
It's her, it's her, it's you!

914
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,130
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, girls,
girls, girls.

915
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:51,801
Let's just go sit down, okay?

916
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:54,770
♪ Look who's here, look who's
here ♪

917
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:56,873
♪ There's a boy I'm mad about ♪

918
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,808
♪ Oh my dear, when he's near ♪

919
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:01,978
♪ So big and strong, so full of
youth ♪

920
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:06,783
♪ Oh Momma, oh Poppa, tell me
the truth ♪

921
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:10,119
- Hey.

922
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:11,854
You need a ride?

923
00:43:11,856 --> 00:43:12,855
- You headed to town?

924
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:16,810
If you don't mind.

925
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:17,894
- Doogie, get in.

926
00:43:17,896 --> 00:43:18,928
- How do you know my...

927
00:43:22,968 --> 00:43:24,801
- We don't know that, Joanna.

928
00:43:24,803 --> 00:43:26,235
We just don't know how long it
takes

929
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:27,270
to walk to town, all right?

930
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:28,171
- Cody's right!

931
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:30,139
Someone is fucking with us.

932
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,245
- We should go find a neighbor.

933
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:39,916
- Robin, we have to assume
that Doug already tried that.

934
00:43:39,918 --> 00:43:41,217
If he'd seen anyone home.

935
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,785
- Why wouldn't anyone be home?

936
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,988
- He was handing out the gift
baskets

937
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,055
and that's what he said, right?

938
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,257
- We should at least try.

939
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:51,928
I mean, he only hit the houses
out front on the main road.

940
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,097
There are a lot more back in the
woods

941
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,265
that we didn't drive by and
he probably didn't get to.

942
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:59,969
- Robin, we're losing it here.

943
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,307
I just think it's a foolish idea

944
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,243
to go wandering through
the woods at night.

945
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:12,281
- Listen to me, Cody has
been trying to warn us, me,

946
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:17,887
about all this and I've
been too focused on my movie

947
00:44:19,057 --> 00:44:20,156
to listen to her.

948
00:44:23,695 --> 00:44:27,363
She's not crazy for being
as scared as she is.

949
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,834
We're crazy for not listening to
her.

950
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,002
- We're all crazy.

951
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,905
Damn it, all right, I'll go.

952
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:37,857
- Thank you.
- We should all go.

953
00:44:37,858 --> 00:44:39,808
- No, no, no, no, you should
honestly stay here with Cody.

954
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:42,078
- You can't just leave three
girls alone.

955
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,146
- Yes, I can.

956
00:44:43,148 --> 00:44:44,247
- Fine.

957
00:44:44,248 --> 00:44:45,347
Cause we're women we
can't handle ourselves?

958
00:44:45,350 --> 00:44:47,233
- Right.

959
00:44:47,234 --> 00:44:49,117
- Look, I'm just as
feminist as the next girl.

960
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,387
Someone threw a fucking
rock through the window.

961
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:53,790
I'm legitimately creeped out.

962
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:54,724
Yeah, we should.

963
00:44:55,427 --> 00:44:56,859
Yeah, we should stay together.

964
00:44:56,861 --> 00:44:59,796
- Robin, you will be together.

965
00:44:59,798 --> 00:45:00,797
I'll be fine.

966
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,199
Okay?

967
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,133
I promise.

968
00:45:05,737 --> 00:45:07,236
- Yeah, okay.

969
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:09,939
- You ready?

970
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:11,207
Lock the doors after me.

971
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:18,448
Hey.

972
00:45:19,784 --> 00:45:21,784
I'll be right back, all right?

973
00:45:22,987 --> 00:45:24,987
And just so you know that it's
me

974
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:27,290
I'm gonna ring the doorbell once

975
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:29,258
and then two quick times, okay?

976
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,861
Like ding, ding ding.
- Okay.

977
00:45:31,863 --> 00:45:33,163
Yeah.
- Okay?

978
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:34,464
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

979
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:35,765
- And if you hear any other type
of ring,

980
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,835
you don't even come to the door.

981
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:39,769
- Wait.

982
00:45:40,772 --> 00:45:42,238
- Are you gonna try next door?

983
00:45:43,842 --> 00:45:45,775
- She was fucking weird, right?

984
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:46,509
And...

985
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:49,378
The chopping outside, it's not
normal.

986
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,180
- I know, I just...

987
00:45:51,182 --> 00:45:53,049
- I'll save it for last.

988
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,818
- Okay, just come back soon.

989
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:58,121
- I will, I'll be right back,
all right?

990
00:45:58,123 --> 00:45:59,055
All right.

991
00:46:23,148 --> 00:46:24,547
- Where are they?

992
00:46:27,252 --> 00:46:29,085
We're just fucking sitting here!

993
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:30,153
- Stop, Cody!
- It's stupid!

994
00:46:30,155 --> 00:46:31,420
- I can't.

995
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:34,223
Please just stop, you're making
it worse.

996
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:36,259
- I'm making it worse?

997
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:37,193
I'm...

998
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,530
Fuck this, I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

999
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:46,836
- Is that the phone?

1000
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:47,570
- The phone works.

1001
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:48,905
The phone works!

1002
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:52,574
- Answer it, go answer it, go
answer it!

1003
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:54,277
- Hello?

1004
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,978
Oh my God, it's Doug!

1005
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,547
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1006
00:46:57,549 --> 00:46:59,366
Hi.

1007
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:01,184
He has a tow truck and
he's five minutes away.

1008
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:05,188
- Okay.
- What took you so long?

1009
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,522
He did get lost.

1010
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,158
Yeah.

1011
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:13,129
Well, we're gonna stay here, of
course.

1012
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:15,965
I love you, Doogie.

1013
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,533
See you soon.

1014
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:19,302
- Thank fucking, God.

1015
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:20,369
Thank fuckin' Doogie!

1016
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,537
- Yeah.
- Doogie.

1017
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,844
- Okay, we have a phone that
works.

1018
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:29,445
Um.

1019
00:47:29,447 --> 00:47:30,697
Who do we call?

1020
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:31,948
- Oh, I should call my
husband.

1021
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:33,650
Tell him I'm okay.

1022
00:47:33,651 --> 00:47:35,351
- No, I meant like, like
the cops.

1023
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,753
- Yeah
- Why?

1024
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,154
I mean, Doug said he was coming,
right?

1025
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:40,890
- Well, yeah, but, Robin,
someone threw a rock

1026
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,559
through our window.

1027
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,227
I mean, that's not--
- Okay, okay, sure, but just.

1028
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,028
I'll call Max really fast.

1029
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,864
Who knows how long that
phone call could take.

1030
00:47:47,866 --> 00:47:50,132
I'll just tell him I'm okay and
then

1031
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:51,000
call the cops right after.

1032
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:52,101
I promise.

1033
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:53,035
I'll be fast.

1034
00:47:54,505 --> 00:47:55,438
- Fine.

1035
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:04,881
- Hey, babe.

1036
00:48:06,551 --> 00:48:07,583
Oh my God, no wait, guys.

1037
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:08,885
He's on his way here.

1038
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:11,220
- Really?
- Yeah, to surprise me.

1039
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:12,989
Wow, that's so fantastic.

1040
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:17,426
No, the shoot's been good,
there's just

1041
00:48:17,428 --> 00:48:19,462
some weird stuff has happened.

1042
00:48:19,464 --> 00:48:20,997
Hey, do you mind?

1043
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,550
No, we're fine.

1044
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,034
I mean, we're gonna call
the cops in a second.

1045
00:48:32,644 --> 00:48:33,609
- I think I'm gonna take a
shower.

1046
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:36,445
kinda calm down a little bit.

1047
00:48:36,447 --> 00:48:38,147
Do you need anything?

1048
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:39,482
- I'm all right.

1049
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,554
- Cody, I think if someone
were trying to, I don't know,

1050
00:48:46,391 --> 00:48:49,525
do whatever, then why would the
phone

1051
00:48:49,527 --> 00:48:50,593
start ringing again?

1052
00:48:52,163 --> 00:48:53,663
I'm with you, that rock was
scary,

1053
00:48:53,665 --> 00:48:55,431
but if someone's trying to fuck
with us

1054
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:56,699
that's just what they're doing.

1055
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,966
They're just fucking with us.

1056
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:00,002
- You're right.

1057
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:00,670
- It's gonna be okay.

1058
00:49:16,187 --> 00:49:17,219
- You home?

1059
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,224
Hello?

1060
00:49:44,449 --> 00:49:45,414
Hello?

1061
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:48,684
Guys, anyone home?

1062
00:49:48,686 --> 00:49:50,486
We just need help.

1063
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,687
Our car is broken down.

1064
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:32,628
- Yeah, I know.

1065
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,731
It's been an interesting week.

1066
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:57,686
- Help.

1067
00:50:57,688 --> 00:50:59,088
- Doug.

1068
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,290
- Help.

1069
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:02,558
- Doug.

1070
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,825
- Make it stop.

1071
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:06,078
- Where are you, man?

1072
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,329
- I'm hurt,
please.

1073
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:10,366
- What are you doing out there?

1074
00:51:10,368 --> 00:51:12,301
I was worried about you, man.

1075
00:51:12,303 --> 00:51:15,238
What the--

1076
00:51:33,825 --> 00:51:36,225
Please.

1077
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:37,426
Please, don't kill me.

1078
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:39,328
Please.

1079
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:42,098
- Are you scared?

1080
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,832
- Yes.

1081
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,367
Yes.

1082
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:46,735
- I envy you.

1083
00:51:55,413 --> 00:51:56,345
Leave it.

1084
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,316
Go on, get the bucket.

1085
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:15,831
You understand what I'm
trying to do, right?

1086
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:18,701
- Yes, of course.

1087
00:52:22,206 --> 00:52:23,606
- Good.

1088
00:52:26,777 --> 00:52:28,611
I know you have a different
vision

1089
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:32,448
for how this would pan out.

1090
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,321
I did this for all of us.

1091
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:44,326
Give me your eyes.

1092
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,263
Because we're a family.

1093
00:52:50,368 --> 00:52:51,300
- Yes.

1094
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:54,737
There's no one in the world I
trust more.

1095
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:55,871
- Gold star.

1096
00:52:59,177 --> 00:52:59,909
Faith.

1097
00:53:00,912 --> 00:53:03,612
It's an important quality to
have.

1098
00:53:03,614 --> 00:53:06,348
It's something I admire about
you.

1099
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,294
Mm.

1100
00:53:18,296 --> 00:53:19,728
Don't forget the pinky toe.

1101
00:53:23,467 --> 00:53:24,500
Oh.

1102
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,209
- It's just been
problem after problem.

1103
00:53:34,212 --> 00:53:35,311
I'm glad your coming.

1104
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,313
I'm excited to see you too.

1105
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,481
- How did Doug know our
number?

1106
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:41,250
- Oh, just one second.

1107
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:42,751
- When I was talking to him on
the phone

1108
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:43,686
he seemed different.

1109
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:44,753
He seemed odd.

1110
00:53:48,693 --> 00:53:50,526
He didn't correct me.

1111
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:51,927
- Didn't correct what?

1112
00:53:51,929 --> 00:53:54,663
- I called him Dougie
and he didn't correct me.

1113
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:58,767
- Um, sorry, babe.

1114
00:53:58,769 --> 00:54:00,636
We need to call the police.

1115
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:02,771
I'll call you back right after,
I promise.

1116
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,631
- No!

1117
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:03,632
No!

1118
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:06,535
No!

1119
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:08,304
- Hello?

1120
00:55:09,307 --> 00:55:10,806
Max, are you there?

1121
00:55:10,808 --> 00:55:12,775
It's dead again.

1122
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:13,642
Max?

1123
00:55:28,326 --> 00:55:29,758
Max, oh fuck!

1124
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,026
- How does that happen?

1125
00:55:31,028 --> 00:55:32,661
- Where's Joanna?

1126
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,463
- She's upstairs taking a
shower.

1127
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:38,801
- Oh God.

1128
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:43,372
Joanna, are you in there?

1129
00:55:46,077 --> 00:55:46,942
Joanna?

1130
00:55:48,879 --> 00:55:50,746
You said she was in the shower?

1131
00:55:50,747 --> 00:55:52,614
- I know, but I don't
hear the water running.

1132
00:55:54,885 --> 00:55:55,818
- Oh, thank God.

1133
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:56,985
- What?
- It's Aaron.

1134
00:55:56,987 --> 00:55:58,420
- No, it could be anyone.

1135
00:55:58,421 --> 00:55:59,854
- He did our secret ring, it's
him.

1136
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:01,924
- Girl Scout cookies.

1137
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,059
- Oh my God, run, run!
- Don't be scared.

1138
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,879
- Oh God, no, no, no, no
no!

1139
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,697
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God, oh my God!

1140
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:11,734
Oh my God, no!

1141
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:27,850
No!

1142
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:31,920
Oh no!

1143
00:56:34,592 --> 00:56:35,457
- We have to get up.

1144
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,492
We have to get up.

1145
00:56:36,494 --> 00:56:37,159
Cody, you have to get up.

1146
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:38,427
We gotta get up.

1147
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:39,428
We gotta go.

1148
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,029
- Oh, there you are, Peter.

1149
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,113
- Where, where?

1150
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:03,852
Come here, come here.

1151
00:57:03,854 --> 00:57:05,988
Okay, okay.

1152
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:08,557
Get down, get down.
- No!

1153
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:14,496
- Please, please, don't leave
me.

1154
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:20,436
She's...

1155
00:57:20,438 --> 00:57:21,170
She's right...

1156
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,112
- Look in my eyes, she can't get
in.

1157
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,166
- Scooch.

1158
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:57,005
Girls, Robin, Cody?

1159
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,007
- I don't wanna die.

1160
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:01,008
- I just wanna tell
you a story.

1161
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,546
It's about Paul Bunyan!

1162
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,116
Fuck, this is harder than I
thought.

1163
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,935
- No, no, no, no,

1164
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:11,753
Please, please!
The lumberjack extraordinaire!

1165
00:58:11,755 --> 00:58:12,754
- You can not!

1166
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:19,895
No.
- Fee, fie, foe, fum!

1167
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:24,867
I smell the blood of two
bitches!

1168
00:58:25,636 --> 00:58:27,736
- You were always braver
than me.

1169
00:58:27,737 --> 00:58:29,837
- Your tears bring me
pleasure.

1170
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,006
- I'm so sorry.

1171
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,742
- I'm gonna murder
you.

1172
00:58:33,744 --> 00:58:34,743
- Come on.

1173
00:58:35,746 --> 00:58:37,880
We're gonna rush him.

1174
00:58:37,882 --> 00:58:39,715
Come on, come on, we're gonna...

1175
00:58:41,252 --> 00:58:42,918
Who could that be?

1176
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:46,788
Come on.

1177
00:58:46,790 --> 00:58:47,656
Come on.

1178
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:48,590
- Robin?

1179
00:59:00,571 --> 00:59:01,303
Robin?

1180
00:59:02,606 --> 00:59:04,172
Robin, you here?

1181
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:05,240
- Max!

1182
00:59:05,242 --> 00:59:06,942
- Where are you guys?
- Max, run!

1183
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:08,777
Max, just fucking run!

1184
00:59:08,779 --> 00:59:09,812
- What happened to this door?

1185
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:10,846
What kind of movie are you guys
shooting?

1186
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,218
What's going on, you okay?

1187
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,152
Holy shit!

1188
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:19,221
- Who the fuck are them?

1189
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:20,088
Did you see them?

1190
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,573
Did you see the people?

1191
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:23,057
There's these people and
they've been trying to hurt us.

1192
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,860
- Okay, okay, you okay?

1193
00:59:24,862 --> 00:59:26,261
I see you, okay?

1194
00:59:26,263 --> 00:59:27,729
- We have to go, we have to go.

1195
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,565
We have to go right now,
we have to go right now.

1196
00:59:29,567 --> 00:59:30,232
Cody, let's go.

1197
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,000
Cody, let's go!

1198
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:34,002
Come, come on, come on.
- No.

1199
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:34,970
- Yes, yes, we're going.

1200
00:59:34,972 --> 00:59:36,655
- No, no.

1201
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,339
- Come on.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1202
00:59:38,342 --> 00:59:39,808
No!

1203
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,844
Wait, no, no, no, stop!

1204
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:43,712
- We have to go.

1205
00:59:43,714 --> 00:59:44,880
- Stop!

1206
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,047
It's like they're one step ahead
of us!

1207
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,182
You know it.

1208
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,150
They knew.

1209
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:49,618
- Let's go.

1210
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,085
- They orchestrated everything.

1211
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,554
It's like they knew.

1212
00:59:52,555 --> 00:59:54,021
- It's okay.
- What's she talking about?

1213
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:56,024
- They knew.
- I don't know.

1214
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,092
- They knew.

1215
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,365
- Cody.

1216
01:00:03,367 --> 01:00:04,299
- Look.

1217
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,670
- I don't see anything.

1218
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:10,339
- They're filming us.

1219
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:14,710
- Those sick fucks, why?

1220
01:00:19,717 --> 01:00:20,649
- Oh, he's back.

1221
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:22,084
- What?

1222
01:00:22,086 --> 01:00:23,085
- He's back for us.

1223
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:23,919
- Cody, who's back?

1224
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:24,786
What is it?

1225
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:26,021
What is it?

1226
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:27,322
- Ha, Binny it's him.

1227
01:00:27,324 --> 01:00:29,257
- Who?
- He came back for us.

1228
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:31,893
It's Dad, he's back.

1229
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:34,029
He knew, he knows that we're
friends

1230
01:00:34,031 --> 01:00:36,765
and he can't handle it, and
he's gonna come back for me.

1231
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:37,699
- Cody, stop!

1232
01:00:37,701 --> 01:00:38,967
- He's always been back for me.

1233
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,335
And he could never leave me.
- Shut up!

1234
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,871
You need to pull yourself
together, okay?

1235
01:00:42,873 --> 01:00:44,740
'Cause we're gonna get outta
this.

1236
01:00:44,742 --> 01:00:46,141
We're gonna get outta this.

1237
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,676
- No, we're not.

1238
01:00:48,646 --> 01:00:51,780
We're never getting outta this.

1239
01:00:51,782 --> 01:00:54,116
- Okay, okay, if they're filming
us

1240
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:55,851
then they're listening to us.

1241
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,286
So.

1242
01:00:58,288 --> 01:00:59,538
What do we do?

1243
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:00,789
- We do something unexpected.

1244
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:02,090
Come on, come on, over here,
come on.

1245
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:03,025
Let's go!

1246
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:08,096
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1247
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,851
- Robin, wait, wait!

1248
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:33,021
- Gah, fuck, ah, get it
off!

1249
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,856
Get it off!
- Hold still, I'm trying!

1250
01:01:36,727 --> 01:01:38,393
- Can you walk?

1251
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:39,261
Take the camera.

1252
01:01:39,263 --> 01:01:40,852
- Okay.

1253
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:42,442
- And I'll help, I'll
help Max.

1254
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:44,032
Okay, come on, come
on, you have to get up.

1255
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,370
- All right, all right,
okay.

1256
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:51,640
- I'm gonna turn
the camera off, okay?

1257
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,374
- No, no, no, no, no, there
could be more of those things!

1258
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,108
- Okay, we'll,
just cover the light

1259
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:56,778
and we'll use it sparingly,
okay?

1260
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,713
Here.

1261
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:00,282
It wastes battery to turn it off
and on.

1262
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:01,216
- Okay.

1263
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,510
Okay, all right.

1264
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:30,811
I just need to, I need to
wrap my head around this one.

1265
01:02:31,482 --> 01:02:32,748
What exactly happened--

1266
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:34,149
- I don't know they--

1267
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:35,016
- They what?

1268
01:02:35,018 --> 01:02:36,084
- They showed up.

1269
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,151
- They showed up doing
what?

1270
01:02:37,154 --> 01:02:38,987
Why didn't you call the cops?

1271
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,422
- We tried, but they
turned

1272
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,856
our fucking phones off, Max.

1273
01:02:41,859 --> 01:02:44,159
- There's just a lot of
things you could've done here

1274
01:02:44,161 --> 01:02:47,329
and I'm just not sure you did
everything.

1275
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:49,164
I just need some answers!

1276
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,316
- It's not really the
time, okay?

1277
01:02:51,317 --> 01:02:53,467
- Okay, no, but I need
to know what's going on, okay?

1278
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:55,837
No more secrets, no more
excuses!

1279
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:56,905
- He'll hear us.

1280
01:02:56,906 --> 01:02:57,972
- Who is going to hear us?

1281
01:02:57,975 --> 01:02:59,775
Your dead father?

1282
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:01,476
Why would she say that, Robin?

1283
01:03:01,478 --> 01:03:03,345
What does that have to do
with...

1284
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:04,479
With any of this?

1285
01:03:05,783 --> 01:03:07,082
- You didn't tell him.

1286
01:03:07,084 --> 01:03:08,950
- Tell me what?

1287
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,256
- Cody.

1288
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:15,223
- What was that?

1289
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:16,825
What was that script?

1290
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:20,262
- Cody, it's, it's, it's how I
feel.

1291
01:03:20,264 --> 01:03:23,031
It just might, not have happened
that way.

1292
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:24,399
- And so that's
what that moment was.

1293
01:03:24,401 --> 01:03:25,968
Just script fodder.

1294
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,536
Something to make your
character more complicated!

1295
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:28,837
- Cody, please.

1296
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:31,173
- You are disgusting.

1297
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,943
- Don't use that word.

1298
01:03:38,115 --> 01:03:39,080
Cody, run!

1299
01:03:39,082 --> 01:03:40,582
- Oh, fuck!

1300
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:55,096
- Slow it down.

1301
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:57,833
- Oh, faster, faster, faster.

1302
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,578
The sun's coming up soon so.

1303
01:04:10,914 --> 01:04:12,881
God knows how long I've been out
here.

1304
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,918
I just wanted to say something
to...

1305
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:21,223
You.

1306
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:25,927
People are gonna know what
happened here.

1307
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:31,466
You thought you planned it so
perfectly,

1308
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:33,969
but you made a mistake.

1309
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,404
You left an opening for me.

1310
01:05:22,101 --> 01:05:23,150
- Happy New
Year!

1311
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:25,420
I'm just so blooming excited.

1312
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:28,390
- Ah, the day, I
fell in love with directing.

1313
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:29,975
- I'm not sure that it's
working.

1314
01:05:29,976 --> 01:05:31,559
- Mm-hmm, it must
be in the movie, I love it.

1315
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:33,361
- Yeah, it's confusing.

1316
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:34,963
I just...

1317
01:05:34,965 --> 01:05:38,366
I just feel like the
audience's expectations

1318
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:39,634
are that this will come back
later.

1319
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:42,337
It isn't clear that it's
your first experience

1320
01:05:42,339 --> 01:05:44,139
with a camera.

1321
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,940
And you can't lose your
audience at the beginning

1322
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,309
then you're fucked.

1323
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:50,712
- Remember your push back
with the cheetah footage.

1324
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:52,213
Work with me on this.

1325
01:05:52,215 --> 01:05:54,015
I don't wanna have another
fight.

1326
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:56,685
- Yeah.

1327
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:01,256
- Is this hard?

1328
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,190
- To edit?

1329
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:03,725
- No.

1330
01:06:05,028 --> 01:06:06,361
To watch your friends die?

1331
01:06:14,171 --> 01:06:15,103
Robin.

1332
01:06:16,073 --> 01:06:17,005
- Yes.

1333
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:21,676
- I asked is it hard
to watch your friends die?

1334
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,714
- Uh, no, not any more.

1335
01:06:26,984 --> 01:06:28,149
I've gotten numb to it.

1336
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,287
Also, I'm, I'm excited.

1337
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:35,590
- Really?
- Yeah.

1338
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:36,458
- I couldn't tell.

1339
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,310
- No, I am.

1340
01:06:38,311 --> 01:06:40,161
I think it's gonna be very good.

1341
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:42,597
Excellent.

1342
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:43,531
A work of art.

1343
01:06:45,202 --> 01:06:46,735
- I'll buy that for a
dollar.

1344
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:51,172
- Should I make dinner soon?

1345
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,407
- That would be
wonderful.

1346
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:53,341
- Okay.

1347
01:06:56,613 --> 01:07:00,148
- I love the exposed wood in the
ceilings.

1348
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,583
There's a stray bulb on set.

1349
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,553
Can you remove it for picture?

1350
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,594
I think we're ready.

1351
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:23,371
I love the symmetry of
your composition, Doogie.

1352
01:07:26,243 --> 01:07:27,542
Very well done today.

1353
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:29,778
You've earned this.

1354
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:32,414
Be a free man now.

1355
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:35,350
First marks, Doogie.

1356
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,266
- Can I say something
to them first, please?

1357
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:55,303
- That would depend
on what you're going to say?

1358
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,138
- Just good things.

1359
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,173
Only good things.

1360
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,142
- Fine.

1361
01:08:04,781 --> 01:08:05,713
- Robin.

1362
01:08:07,184 --> 01:08:08,083
Do everything they say--

1363
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,384
- That's enough!

1364
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:20,428
Little to your right.

1365
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,271
A little smidge back to your
left.

1366
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:33,141
Perfect.

1367
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:50,859
If you please.

1368
01:09:02,906 --> 01:09:04,572
- We're all crazy.

1369
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:12,881
- Help, someone!

1370
01:09:12,883 --> 01:09:14,349
- That's not gonna
help.

1371
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:27,495
- Show me your face, you fucking
coward.

1372
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,566
- Funny coming from you.

1373
01:09:41,778 --> 01:09:43,211
I'll show you right now.

1374
01:09:57,928 --> 01:09:58,860
- Who are you?

1375
01:10:01,498 --> 01:10:03,531
- I think you can do a better
question?

1376
01:10:06,736 --> 01:10:07,669
- Why...

1377
01:10:08,672 --> 01:10:10,738
Why, why are you doing this to
us?

1378
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:13,308
- Ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, we have a winner!

1379
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,542
Here's your answer.

1380
01:10:23,286 --> 01:10:24,819
To whom it may concern,

1381
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:32,260
I know pain, I've watched
it, I studied it, lived it.

1382
01:10:34,297 --> 01:10:36,531
I grew up around it in our
house.

1383
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:39,500
A thick cloud of agony
cuddled in the corner

1384
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:45,006
of every room.

1385
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,540
A stark reminder of our
transgressions.

1386
01:10:47,544 --> 01:10:49,110
- Please, please, please don't.

1387
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,677
Please.
- One minute a person screams

1388
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,848
to cope with it, the
next, they laugh to rob it

1389
01:10:53,850 --> 01:10:55,550
of it's power.

1390
01:10:55,552 --> 01:10:59,988
Some, wear their pain
like a badge of honor.

1391
01:11:00,857 --> 01:11:04,359
Others tuck it away,
hoping no one will ever see

1392
01:11:04,361 --> 01:11:08,263
how weak they really are,
but they can't escape it.

1393
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:13,768
Pain is as authentic to the
human experience as love.

1394
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,838
I see it in my husband
struggling to connect with me.

1395
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:18,740
Pardon me, Doug.

1396
01:11:18,742 --> 01:11:22,610
Every conversation slyly
circling the same question

1397
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,780
over and over again.

1398
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,683
Why don't I understand you?

1399
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:31,786
Not knowing that if he ever
actually asked that question

1400
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:35,290
he'd break the unspoken promise
we've kept all these years.

1401
01:11:35,292 --> 01:11:37,792
A promise, he'll never ask.

1402
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:39,594
There are only two constant
truths

1403
01:11:39,596 --> 01:11:42,330
that I've been able to parse out

1404
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:44,932
through all my observations of
pain.

1405
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:47,835
This is the part that
really I identified with.

1406
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:50,505
Cody, you know where I'm going.

1407
01:11:50,507 --> 01:11:52,040
You read it, right?

1408
01:11:52,042 --> 01:11:53,441
This is why I chose you.

1409
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,812
First, you can't get past it
without

1410
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,514
looking it dead in the eye.

1411
01:11:59,516 --> 01:12:02,350
Those hard questions need to be
asked.

1412
01:12:02,352 --> 01:12:05,086
Those hard answers need to be
faced.

1413
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:09,524
I know this because I've seen my
sister

1414
01:12:09,526 --> 01:12:12,560
ignore the pain she's
held her entire life.

1415
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:17,398
Through seeing her own struggle

1416
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:22,337
I've also realized I've done the
same.

1417
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:29,644
Mm, mm, mm, I think you'll
like this part, Cody.

1418
01:12:31,614 --> 01:12:36,751
I faulted and failed in
many parts of my life.

1419
01:12:36,753 --> 01:12:41,389
I've been selfish, negligent,
uncaring.

1420
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:46,561
I'm not the person I dreamt
I would become as a child.

1421
01:12:47,464 --> 01:12:48,863
Da, da, da, da, da.

1422
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,866
Repeating myself over and
over, "you'll be brave,

1423
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:54,569
"you'll be smart, you'll be
honest,"

1424
01:12:55,472 --> 01:13:00,541
but today is the first day I
start keeping that promise.

1425
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:05,680
My sister deserves a better
sister.

1426
01:13:05,682 --> 01:13:07,415
She's been brave.

1427
01:13:07,417 --> 01:13:08,916
She's been smart.

1428
01:13:09,786 --> 01:13:14,655
But she hasn't been honest,
not with what happened,

1429
01:13:14,657 --> 01:13:18,159
which is why I need this
opportunity

1430
01:13:18,161 --> 01:13:20,995
to film in your beautiful home.

1431
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:24,866
To show my sister and
the world an awful...

1432
01:13:24,868 --> 01:13:27,068
but honest truth.

1433
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:31,572
An axiom once seen will
dispense...

1434
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,074
the second constant

1435
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,711
I've known all these years,

1436
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:44,619
pain...

1437
01:13:49,159 --> 01:13:50,792
can be beautiful.

1438
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:54,495
Sincerely,

1439
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,064
Robin.

1440
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,503
Gets me every time.

1441
01:14:07,076 --> 01:14:08,009
- I...

1442
01:14:09,012 --> 01:14:10,077
I don't know.

1443
01:14:12,182 --> 01:14:13,181
Why?

1444
01:14:13,183 --> 01:14:14,115
Why?

1445
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:19,487
- It's okay.
- Please.

1446
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:29,730
- Smile.

1447
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:32,667
- What?

1448
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,136
- Smile.

1449
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:37,505
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

1450
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:58,493
- Please.

1451
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:01,863
Please, don't, don't kill us.

1452
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:02,697
Please.

1453
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:03,631
- Kill you?

1454
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:05,500
What?

1455
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,034
No, no, no, no, no.

1456
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:09,203
Don't think that, you poor
thing.

1457
01:15:11,207 --> 01:15:12,507
Give me your eyes.

1458
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:15,910
We don't wanna kill you.

1459
01:15:15,912 --> 01:15:17,645
You have everything we need.

1460
01:15:18,715 --> 01:15:19,847
It's all in the essay.

1461
01:15:29,759 --> 01:15:31,158
There you go.

1462
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:33,160
Beautiful.

1463
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,298
Now, we'll collaborate.

1464
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:40,735
Show the world how beautiful
pain can be.

1465
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:44,939
So smile.

1466
01:15:52,282 --> 01:15:53,214
Smile.

1467
01:16:04,928 --> 01:16:06,894

- Dinner time.

1476
01:16:40,163 --> 01:16:42,263
Robin finished her first cut of
the film.

1477
01:16:43,633 --> 01:16:45,366
- Can't I just watch one more
episode?

1478
01:16:45,368 --> 01:16:46,267
- Uh uh.

1479
01:16:46,269 --> 01:16:47,234
Up!

1480
01:16:47,236 --> 01:16:48,169
Up!

1481
01:17:14,397 --> 01:17:15,830
- Cody.

1482
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:16,764
- Hey.

1483
01:17:16,766 --> 01:17:18,099
- How are you?

1484
01:17:18,101 --> 01:17:19,066
How's everything?

1485
01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:22,269
Your hair is getting really
long.

1486
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:25,906
What's wrong with her?
- That's enough.

1487
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,677
It's how she's coping.

1488
01:17:33,683 --> 01:17:35,383
Dinner, it smells wonderful.

1489
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:39,954
Oh, I watched the first cut.

1490
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:44,225
I was noticing, it actually
seems like your husband

1491
01:17:44,227 --> 01:17:46,027
was behind it all.

1492
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:47,028
- Did it?

1493
01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:48,329
Oh, I'll fix that.

1494
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:50,297
- No, I quite like it.

1495
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:53,034
Maybe in the next version
you could lean into that.

1496
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:57,171
Especially when, Cody
thinks her father's back.

1497
01:17:58,408 --> 01:17:59,340
- Yeah.

1498
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:07,748
- It might
add a touch of mystery.

1499
01:18:08,685 --> 01:18:10,117
Could be nice to play with the
trope

1500
01:18:10,119 --> 01:18:12,420
of who's behind the mask?

1501
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:15,122
Challenge the audience's
expectations a little bit.

1502
01:18:15,992 --> 01:18:17,391
- Won't it be disappointing to
find out

1503
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:18,993
it isn't anybody we know?

1504
01:18:22,465 --> 01:18:24,331
- Actually, quite the
opposite.

1505
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:26,901
I think it's a little poetic.

1506
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:30,037
Considering everything that
you and Cody went through

1507
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:31,038
with your father.

1508
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:36,310
Someone you thought you knew
turned out to be a stranger.

1509
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:38,446
No, this is good.

1510
01:18:38,448 --> 01:18:40,448
Audiences like metaphors.

1511
01:18:42,485 --> 01:18:44,819
- Yeah, I think that might be
really nice.

1512
01:18:46,422 --> 01:18:49,156
- It's really
coming along, Robin.

1513
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:50,257
The film looks great.

1514
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:55,029
You're so close to executing my
vision.

1515
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:05,106
You know what would be really
nice?

1516
01:19:05,108 --> 01:19:07,141
If we got a family shot.

1517
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:10,511
Since we're so rarely in
the same room together.

1518
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:13,981
You smell nice.

1519
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,017
How you doing, kiddo?

1520
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,123
Ahh..

1521
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:25,192
Ah.

1522
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:32,500
Well.

1523
01:19:33,369 --> 01:19:34,301
Let's eat.

1524
01:20:18,848 --> 01:20:20,114
