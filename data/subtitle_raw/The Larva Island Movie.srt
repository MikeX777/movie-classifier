20
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,583
Huh?

21
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:02,916
[foreboding music]

22
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:08,625
[shrieks]

23
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,833
[manager] May I take your order, ma'am?

24
00:01:15,916 --> 00:01:18,083
[Granny] What would you recommend
that I'd really like?

25
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,416
[manager] Uh, this.

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,625
[Granny] And this one, right here.

27
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:24,250
- Mm-hm.
- And a salad, I think.

28
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:25,250
[manager] Of course.

29
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,583
Oh! Ah.

30
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,750
[Chuck grunts]

31
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,125
- [manager] Hello. Welcome.
- Huh?

32
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,791
Have you a reservation, sir?
[chuckles]

33
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:36,416
Uh! Um, Gra... Grace, under...

34
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,083
- [Grace grunts, sighs]
- [Chuck groans]

35
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:39,416
Right on time.
[chuckles]

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,083
- [manager] Uh-huh.
- He's not here yet?

37
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:44,416
I have a reservation under Grace.

38
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,583
[manager] Uh...

39
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,500
Um, hmm.

40
00:01:48,583 --> 00:01:50,333
Uh-huh? Hmm?

41
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,041
- [Chuck groans]
- Mm?

42
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,875
Uh, really nice to meet you.

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,250
Ah, and it's nice to meet you.
[chuckles]

44
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,041
[rain pattering]

45
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:04,208
[Grace] Declared missing
from a shipwrecked ocean liner,

46
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,916
only to return alive
after five-and-a-half years

47
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,458
on a desert island.

48
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:09,500
[chuckles]

49
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,791
Ever since I first read your story,

50
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:13,708
I've been dying to turn it into a book.

51
00:02:14,166 --> 00:02:15,583
Thanks for being here.

52
00:02:16,125 --> 00:02:19,000
You're way more handsome
in real life than in your pictures.

53
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:20,375
[spits, coughs]

54
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:22,333
- [Grace] You haven't had lunch yet, right?
- Uh...

55
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,291
Um, not yet.

56
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,458
That's good. I ordered ahead for us.

57
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:28,250
[Chuck] Oh. Uh, thank you.

58
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:31,416
Let's just cover the basics
while we're waiting for our lunch to come.

59
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,875
Is it all right if I record?

60
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:35,208
[Chuck] Yeah, it's okay.

61
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,458
- [recorder clicks]
- Right.

62
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:38,833
How have you been since your return?

63
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,916
Busy, I guess.

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,583
Adjusting to city life again
has been a little rough.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,291
Has it, now?

66
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,208
Oh! Are there strange habits

67
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,166
that you can't break
from your life in the wild,

68
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,583
like capturing and eating pets,

69
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,375
or running around town
with only a spear and a loincloth?

70
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:55,041
[gasps]
Uh, no.

71
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:56,541
Not like that at all.

72
00:02:56,875 --> 00:03:00,375
It's just it hasn't been easy
being around this many people.

73
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,791
[gasps, sighs]
Yes, of course.

74
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:06,833
Well, I really appreciate
you doing this interview.

75
00:03:06,916 --> 00:03:09,750
I had heard you were turning down
everybody that asked for one.

76
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,375
Well, I've been rather torn about that.

77
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,000
I've been worried that no one
would believe what I've been through,

78
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:20,125
not all of it.

79
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,541
But there are some
remarkable little creatures

80
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,250
that the world should hear about.

81
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,500
"Remarkable creatures"?

82
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,625
But weren't you stranded
on the island all alone?

83
00:03:31,666 --> 00:03:34,166
[sighs deeply]

84
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,958
I was alone, and yet I wasn't.

85
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,208
I discovered some special friends.

86
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:41,083
What kind of special friends?

87
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:42,875
Sounds pretty mysterious.

88
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,791
- [Chuck] After the ship went down...
- Hm?

89
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:48,041
I floated in a ducky tube
until I spotted an island.

90
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,500
A desert island so small,

91
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,125
it took five steps to walk
from one end of it to the other.

92
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:54,416
[sighs deeply]

93
00:03:54,791 --> 00:03:57,708
[Chuck] <i>And after six long months
alone on the island,</i>

94
00:03:57,791 --> 00:03:59,291
<i>something happened.</i>

95
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,416

00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:03,791

Huh? Mm? Ah.

If I'm honest here,
this is hard to swallow.

It sounds like a fantasy movie.

Why, you rotten little bugs!
[groans]

1476
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,750
After that stuff, I was able

1485
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:09,375
So you're telling us you shared a bond
with your bug buddies?

1486
01:00:09,458 --> 01:00:10,583
Yeah.

1487
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:12,291
But not just my bug buddies.

Mudskippers as well.

1490
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:19,208
We were trying

Is it gonna storm?

1498
01:00:32,166 --> 01:00:34,666
Looks like we're in

Either burning hot or freezing cold.

No! The fire's going out!

1522
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:37,333
There's nothing else to burn.

1523

01:22:06,125 --> 01:22:08,291
- [Wendy] They're strong.
- [Granny] We're right, you know.

2018
01:22:08,375 --> 01:22:09,625
Yes, you are.

2019
01:22:09,708 --> 01:22:11,083
They're remarkably strong.

2020
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:13,625
And they keep on smiling, no matter what.

2021
01:22:13,708 --> 01:22:15,500
Yay, bugs!
[giggles]

2022
01:22:15,583 --> 01:22:17,500
Go on.

2023
01:22:17,583 --> 01:22:20,291
Please tell us other adventures
you had with Larva.

2024
01:22:20,375 --> 01:22:23,583
Ooh! Larva! Larva! Larva!

2025
01:22:23,666 --> 01:22:24,708
[Wendy] Best story ever!

2026
01:22:24,791 --> 01:22:26,041
Yeah, all right.

2027
01:22:26,125 --> 01:22:28,458
I'll tell you about the time
me and Larva went shark fishing.

2028
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:30,208
- [Wendy] Yay!
- [gasps, chuckles]

2029
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:34,375
We got stuck right in a big
humpback whale's blowhole.

2030
01:22:34,458 --> 01:22:36,125
- [Chuck] Oh, the smell.
- [all laughing]

[Wendy and manager laughing]

2039
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,833
[manager] It's been great.
Come back anytime.

2040
01:22:56,916 --> 01:22:59,125
- [Chuck] Thank you!
- [Wendy] Bye, silly man.

2041
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,458
- [Chuck] Oh, bye, Wendy!
- [manager] Silly.

2042
01:23:01,833 --> 01:23:04,541
Well, that was certainly something else.

2043
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:06,291
I guess it was.

2044
01:23:06,375 --> 01:23:08,708
- I don't remember having a nicer talk.
- Uh...

2045
01:23:09,291 --> 01:23:11,500
Thanks very much for talking to me today.

2046
01:23:11,583 --> 01:23:13,083
Sure, not a problem.

2047
01:23:13,166 --> 01:23:14,166
I thank you.

2048
01:23:15,166 --> 01:23:19,583
I realized today it's not as important
everyone believe me as I thought it was.

2049
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:23,750
As long as I still remember my friends,
I'll remember it's all true.

2050
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:27,125
[Chuck] Whether people believe
it all really happened,

2051
01:23:27,583 --> 01:23:29,083
well, that's up to them.

2052
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:33,041
I finally truly feel like
I've completely left the island behind.

2053
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:34,625
[chuckles]

2054
01:23:34,708 --> 01:23:36,666
Mm, uh...

2055
01:23:37,541 --> 01:23:39,500
Well, we're happy to have you back, Chuck.

2056
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:41,541
Thanks very much, Grace.

2057
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:43,833

[Grace] <i>To be honest,
when I first heard his story,</i>

2061
01:23:54,958 --> 01:23:57,083
<i>I thought he was a big, lying liar pants.</i>

2062
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:01,125
<i>Even now, I'm still not sure
I believe all of it.</i>

2063
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:06,291
<i>But I've written this book
with the earnest hope</i>

2064
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:10,083
<i>that everyone will hear
of his amazing experiences,</i>

2065
01:24:10,166 --> 01:24:12,250

he made on the island.</i>

2066

[Grace] <i>...felt almost transported
to the island themselves.</i>

2072
01:24:27,791 --> 01:24:30,000
<i>It was clearly real to Chuck.</i>

2073
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:31,666
- <i>And frankly...</i>
- Huh?

2074
01:24:31,750 --> 01:24:33,875

- <i>...that's good enough for this writer.</i>

2075

to all who read this book as well.</i>
