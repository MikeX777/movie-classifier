20
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:21,321
The underground music of Iran that sparked after the arrest in Karaj.
where 400 got arrested in that concert, had it's spark from there.

00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:22,229
-And I've heard that Ashkan has been released.
-Yea he got released on Monday, and is out now.

35
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:31,548
I heard you rocked. The guys said you were on the dish.
A gathering, and blood was served like a satanistic worship...

36
00:05:32,447 --> 00:05:38,785
You know, They put their own perception on it
when they see someone playing their music close them down.

37
00:05:42,917 --> 00:05:48,143
-I've heard you're going to London invited to a festival
-To do what? we need to have a band...

38
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,145
We can take care of that, and get you a band.
You need two guitar player, a bassist and a drummer.

39
00:05:52,146 --> 00:05:54,708
Listen! Ashkan is saying that we should leave for good.

40
00:05:54,709 --> 00:06:02,595
This year it'll get an Oscar. Yes yes yes this one!
It'll get an Oscar. If not I'll give you all my movies for free.

41
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,410
Listen Babak! I don't have any problems going.
I've already left once and my Passport and visa is ok.

42
00:06:08,696 --> 00:06:12,172
Now the problem is Ashkan.
If we can find someone for that it'd be great.

43
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:13,417
Find one for what?

44
00:06:13,771 --> 00:06:18,111
-To get him across
-So you want to find someone to get him over?

45
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:24,982
Wait. Do you see that guy?
He's into music and a good friend. Do you want me to tell him?

46
00:06:26,003 --> 00:06:29,182
-Can he arrange a band as well?
Yea he can fix anything, you want me to tell him?

47
00:06:29,474 --> 00:06:31,624
I'm not at all into getting people across!
You get that?

48
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:32,898
-You don't do that?
-Yes

49
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:36,974
-Really?
-You say this stuff, and she starts believing stuff...

50
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,990
How many did you get over two years ago?

51
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,680
-David did that, has nothing to do with me.

52
00:06:43,775 --> 00:06:46,484
Doesn't matter. David or whoever.
Just get their thing going.

53
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:52,452
-Now anyone that has beef with his mom...
-No one has had a fight with his mother.

54
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:57,364
I don't have a beef with my mom and I'm not going.
It's Ashkan that's going.

55
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:58,553
Who's Ashkan?

56
00:06:58,686 --> 00:07:03,210
Ashkan's in their band. Why you acting like this
Just get their thing going.

57
00:07:03,045 --> 00:07:07,269
-Does Ashkan have a beef with his mom? So what?
-We going to play music and sing

58
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,583
He doesn't have a passport or visa...

59
00:07:10,438 --> 00:07:14,029
Well you have all sort of people playing music.
Get to know them and play with them.

60
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,686
But here you can't play any kind of music.
You can't say whatever you want to say...

61
00:07:18,501 --> 00:07:21,972
How am I supposed sing here?
It's impossible...

62
00:07:22,201 --> 00:07:23,542
No no! What did you say just before?

63
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,183
I said you can't play your music here.

64
00:07:25,556 --> 00:07:30,461
Yes that's what I want to hear!
So you guy's don't have beefs with your mommas?

65
00:07:30,462 --> 00:07:35,206
He's going because of his music.
That! I like! I will do this then.

00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:41,736

00:07:47,972 --> 00:07:52,505
-Nader! Where are we?
Patience! Ouch! Police...

68
00:07:59,963 --> 00:08:01,435
You like this, don't you?

69
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:04,321
It's great...

70
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:08,914
All right then.

71
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:11,858

73
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:19,750
You little sweet thing!
My precious! Were you alone?

74
00:08:21,505 --> 00:08:27,959
-Nader, what's its name?
-Bellucci! Monica Bellucci!

75
00:08:32,968 --> 00:08:38,141
Hello there! I've got two guests with me.
Sorry! they were watching Indian movies.

76
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:43,201
These two birds love Indian movies.
This one's Scarlett and that one's Edward.

77
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:48,959
They've seen all the movies in the history of India
The movie Sholeh...give me the CD

78
00:08:49,164 --> 00:08:54,948
The scene where she's dancing on glass.
They cried! I swear to god they cried!!!

79
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:57,162
Saw it myself, this one! And that one too.
Both of them cried.

80
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:58,767
That's how you define lovebirds.

81
00:09:00,107 --> 00:09:07,001
All right, this is the best studio for distribution to the world.
To hell with Paramount and 20:th century and Warner Brother...

82
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:12,470
I really claim that. You get it?
I honk it! I'm the top studio!

83
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:16,476
All right! Tell me about your CD?
I'll be right back with you. Got my back towards you, I apologize.

84
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:21,117
This is what we've done.
It's from two years ago.

85
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:23,497
We recorded it together...

86
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,424
What happened, and what did you do?

87
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:27,931
Nothing...just been there.

88
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:29,738
You got permit for it?

89
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:30,705
Hell no! It doesn't!

90
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:34,889
You want me to get it out in the black market?
100 000 to get it all over Tehran?

91
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:40,785
Bigger distribution than you get from guidance ministry?
You want it? I'll do it. I will do that!

92
00:09:41,488 --> 00:09:42,810
Let's listen to it.

93
00:10:25,582 --> 00:10:28,991
Is this your work?
You've played this?

94
00:10:30,444 --> 00:10:32,487
-Is he telling the truth?
-Yes!

95
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:34,945
Are you sane boy?
Do you know you could do with this?

96
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:39,023
We did Nader.
Knocked on every door, even broke them.

97
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,303
It doesn't work.
It's meaningless.

98
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:45,176
Here you can't do anything.
In this country you don't have a chance.

99
00:10:48,051 --> 00:10:51,763
We'll do it!
I'll get you permit for it.

100
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,451
Start breaking doors again!
Scream again, what the hell!!!

101
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:59,297
That's what music's about!
That's the best thing you can do!

102
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:02,897
What nonsense is it to leave it?
Not being able to do it in your own country?

103
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:06,502
I'll do it for you!
I'm connected to one heavy guy in the guidance ministry

104
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:15,830
Going to get you a real permit, legit! Original!
Sell you tickets for thousands of attendants.

105
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:18,406
Nader?
We've come for something else...

106
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:27,654
Of course, I know! I'll get you passport and visa.
But once do it for you people and friends here.

107
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:32,190
I know the quality of this.
Isn't Indie-Rock the genre you play?

108
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:36,505
Well I'm not an ass, I know you want to create a band.

109
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:40,894
-You have 312 Indie-Rock bands only here in Iran!
-How's that possible?

110
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,234
How's it not possible?
You think it's only Tehran?

111
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:49,721
Have you heard Kurdish Indie-Rock? Khorasani?
Lor or Baloch? There you go.

112
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:55,032
There's 2500 something Pop groups in Iran.
Where's all the females who're forbidden to sing?

113
00:11:55,585 --> 00:12:02,287
Here! I know each and every of the females that
aren't allowed to sing. I know three generation of musicians, see!

114
00:12:03,811 --> 00:12:14,667
He's really good, This friend is a genius.
Beyond expectation...

115
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,939
Hamed!

116
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:37,538
-Yes
-Hi!

117
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:53,585
Hi!
How are you?

118
00:12:58,397 --> 00:13:00,568
Sit down.

119
00:13:04,795 --> 00:13:11,631
Did you know that one's not the mother?
It was hit in an accident and had six kittens

120
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:16,260
Ok you tell them the story then.

121
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:24,677
She was pregnant, but because of the platinum that she had in her stomach
from the accident she couldn't deliver.

122
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,923
So my brothers friends brought these
so both she could be happy and these kittens.

123
00:13:35,886 --> 00:13:45,413
You know Hamed we are looking for a good guitar player.
If it goes as planned we'll create a band.

124
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:49,438
Chances are that we travel abroad.
Have some concerts and record something.

125
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:51,703
What's your genre?

126
00:13:52,641 --> 00:13:59,820
-It's something like Indie-Rock, and if could help us
-Yes if there's anything I can do, sure.

127
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:40,564
-What'd you think of Hamed?
He was good, very good. I think he'll leave before we do.

128
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:45,534
Everybody's leaving.
What should we do with the e-mail from London if can't make it?

129
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:56,166
-I don't know
-There's also an e-mail from France for independent foreign groups after London.

130
00:15:57,218 --> 00:16:02,468
You know what I think We should pay Nader some more
so he gets us permits for concerts and a cassettes.

131
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:08,106
Let's first see this David...
That money is more important. Don't need to think of the cassette that much.

132
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:12,412
Cause I'm sure they wont grant us a permit.
It's impossible.

133
00:16:15,478 --> 00:16:21,340
First off we've got to go and see all the groups
and choose the one we want to work with.

134
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,953
Guitarist, a drummer...

135
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:33,689
If we got a concert it'd be great, we could invite all our friends.
We can invite our parents too, let them at least see us play for once.

136
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:59,173
Nader, may I ask
have we got to pay David all at once or can we split it up?

137
00:17:59,374 --> 00:18:02,551
We'll work it out somehow
just follow me I'll handle it.

138
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,213
-Sorry but these days it's a little tight
-Don't worry about it, come here

139
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:13,841
-Hi! Know where David is?
-Through there and turn right.

140
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,778
-You got it Negar? Ashkan did you get it?
-Yes of course I'm aware.

141
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,043
Just act innocent for a couple of minutes
and everything will be OK.

142
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:47,625
...just so you know you're getting a discount...

143
00:18:47,723 --> 00:18:50,326
Hello Sir!

144
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:56,817
-What kind of a greeting is that?
-We said hello sir.

145
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,247
Yes.
Sit down.

146
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:04,802
Take a seat to the left
but careful it's broken, make sure you don't fall.

147
00:19:08,206 --> 00:19:13,020
You disappeared for two months.
What kind of movie was it you gave me, it was rubbish.

148
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:14,802
It's a great movie
what was wrong with it?

149
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:18,102
-No! It wasn't good.
-Romantic ones are better than police movies.

150
00:19:18,376 --> 00:19:20,959
-No! Romantic, no!
-What do like?

151
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,002
-War movies, WAR! WAR!
-War movies...

152
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,003
-Kill kill, pang pang!
-How many you want him to kill?

153
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,004
-Hundreds!
-Kill hundreds?

154
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,834
Yes! Hundreds!
But he should be in love too.

155
00:19:28,869 --> 00:19:33,141
-Well you can't have it all
-Well he should kill them and be in love too.

156
00:19:36,611 --> 00:19:41,040
Here you have a police movie.
It's Marlon Brando.

157
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:44,406
Marlon Brando. No!
It's old, I want new ones.

158
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:52,388
-Excuse me are you here to get passports?
-No we've come to get our visas.

159
00:19:52,713 --> 00:19:57,589
-Where do you want to go?
-Wherever we may find pleasant. Australia, Germany, America, England...

160
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:10,766
We want to go away for an exchange and see places we've yet not seen
like the Louvre, Niagara falls. If we like it we might even stay...

161
00:20:18,178 --> 00:20:24,207
Please take him out of here.
Don't want to see him...

162
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,730
-Here! Look I've got Al Pacino for you.
-I Don't want Al Pacino either.

163
00:20:30,614 --> 00:20:34,284
-I want that guy that I liked...
-I got it, he wants Nicholas Cage.

164
00:20:34,285 --> 00:20:35,921
Yes the one looking like him in his youth.

165
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,307
-We are having a concert in London.
-How many are you?

166
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:46,777
-We are five
-And what do you play?

167
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,627
It's Indie-Rock

168
00:20:48,628 --> 00:20:55,141
Very nice, I like Indie-Rock
and I like 50-cent too

169
00:20:55,953 --> 00:20:59,262
I hope we could see each other there
so we could come to your concert.

170
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,084
I hope we do.

171
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:05,390
-David, sir! Are our passports ready?
-They'll be ready soon.

172
00:21:05,391 --> 00:21:11,737
-Houshang! Bring those two passports!
-I'll bring them down now.

173
00:21:11,738 --> 00:21:20,102
Ebi go and get them.
Come here Mr. Kamran your visas are ready.

174
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:25,650
A little this way.
Now come here.

175
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:33,205
-Mr. Kamran...This one's yours.
-Thank you very much.

176
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:38,777
-What's your wife's surname?
-Bolorian.

177
00:21:38,778 --> 00:21:44,821
One A has not been marked
but it's not a problem, don't worry.

178
00:21:44,822 --> 00:21:55,846
-I hope it doesn't get us in trouble...can you please fix it?
-It's OK, if it'd cause anything we'd fixit, but it's OK

179
00:21:57,186 --> 00:22:03,176
Well we're leaving then
I hope I'll see you again.

180
00:22:03,376 --> 00:22:06,357
Me too!
Goodbye!

181
00:22:08,136 --> 00:22:10,699
-Goodbye!
-Goodbye! I hope you have a good trip.

182
00:22:15,555 --> 00:22:17,027
Guys come over and sit here!

183
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:31,984
As I told you, these are fine artists
and they want to go abroad.

00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,996

00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:52,478

00:22:53,692 --> 00:22:55,164
-So Ashkan, do you intend to emigrate?
-Well yes if it's possible.

193
00:22:57,418 --> 00:23:07,001
-How many passports do you need?
-Negar doesn't need a passport, so we need five visas and two passports.

194
00:23:08,992 --> 00:23:13,269
Write it! Five passports!
-No! Five visas and two passports.

195
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:17,461
Write it correct!
Do you the prices?

196
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,174
-No! We don't know the prices.
-Ebi read it to them!

Oil price goes up, costs goes up.
Oil price goes down, and the costs go down.

207
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:31,635
Thank God it's not war time.
Costs go up, really high. up up up.

208
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,821
Pardon me sister.
We just fool around a little out of tiredness.

209
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:49,153
-Well thank you.
-Will you have their passports ready in ten days?

210
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:53,181
-Gods will, yes!
-I give you the money, you assure it'll be done?

211
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:56,710
Yes! When you get me money yes!

00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:02,450
-Thank you! Pleasure seeing you.
-Goodbye Sir!

213
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,571
-You're Wellcome! May God protect you.
-Close the door!

214
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:10,664
-Why? What do you mean?
-Ashkan I'm not at all hopeful this'll work.

215
00:25:11,203 --> 00:25:16,668
-This passport and visa do you know money it is?
-The money is solved

216
00:25:18,066 --> 00:25:18,911
What?
How?

217
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:25,357
Two days ago I called my mother in Germany
She said the 23-24 millions that left of my dads money

218
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:30,793
she's going to transfer it to my account.
The money is here in a couple of days.

219
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,276
What happened, you smashed your phone against the wall again?

220
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:30,948
Everythings a chaos now I'm so confused.

221
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:38,212
Ya! Like now I've done a back vocal line for a female voice
and I've no idea where to get that.

222
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:47,060
Then this visa and passport thing that I'm worried about.
And if this man really can arrange it.

223
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:51,065
And I'm not sure whether this Nader is bluffer...

224
00:26:51,447 --> 00:26:56,910
Did'nt I say it won't work?
But you're not listening.

225
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:07,280
-Ashkan did you bring your documents?
-Yes here they are.

226
00:27:07,281 --> 00:27:12,655
-Put them in my bag!
-But this one doesn't have a picture. It'll take some days.

227
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:23,843
Look, I'm going to introduce you to a heavenly voice.

228
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:47,159
Who is this? Tell me!
It's amazing. You know her?

229
00:27:49,296 --> 00:27:51,306
Babak! I'll be right back.

230
00:27:52,689 --> 00:27:57,113
Hi!
How are you doing?

231
00:28:00,975 --> 00:28:04,105
Babak who is this?
She's really good!

232
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:35,610
You know except for getting permits
she has connection abroad and knows about concerts there

233
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:43,262
-Could you talk to her about it?
-Yes of course. She's such a kind person.

234
00:29:44,076 --> 00:29:47,659
She's an angel.
She's already established as well.

235
00:29:48,646 --> 00:29:59,718
-Just having her in the group will gain you more attention.
-She's experienced the same pain and will look after you.

236
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:09,460
-Why need another back vocal, we got Negar. She's really good.
-I know but with just one girl you don't get a permit.

237
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:17,553
-Ashkan listen, do you like this lyric for a track in the album?
-Let me hear it.

238
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:23,758
For the darkness of the clouds of the night
For the devastation of the feverish days

239
00:30:24,826 --> 00:30:25,900
Night!
Fever!

240
00:30:27,441 --> 00:30:28,494
Darkness!
Devestation!

241
00:30:29,379 --> 00:30:29,995
Lonelyness!

242
00:30:29,996 --> 00:30:34,616
-Is it good?
-I'd say it's black.

243
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,182
-How is it black?
-Did you write it in prison?

244
00:30:39,347 --> 00:30:45,958
-Whatever I write you keep saying it's black.
-Well cause it is! Night, loneliness, darkness and devastation.

245
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:51,205
Now that we want to get a permit
we have to make them sound more happy.

246
00:30:58,045 --> 00:31:01,357
Yes?
Who's it?

247
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,320
Hi Nader!
Are you OK? I'll come down now.

248
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:10,129
Damn he's fast.
Faster give it to me.

249
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:16,724
-I was already ironing it.
-Let me do it I'm in a hurry, you keep an eye on the food.

250
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:20,209
-Where are you going?
-We're going to check out a Heavy Metal band.

251
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,804
-What are you going to do?
-Nothing. When I'm done with this I'll leave.

252
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,675
I'll call you later and we can leave together.

253
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:33,368
-Do they play here?
-No Ariyan works here, me and him will go and you should come to the same address.

254
00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:43,949
Ariyan!

255
00:31:54,053 --> 00:32:00,382
-Tell him to stop that I'm going blind man.
-Please take a break for five minutes.

256
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:04,489
-Ashkan
-How are you?

257
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:14,106
-Bro I've come to get some stuff to the guys
-Do you work here?

258
00:32:14,492 --> 00:32:19,339
Ya what can I do?
It's my fathers workshop and I help out, I like it.

259
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:36,304
Hello Sir!
How are you?

260
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:39,529
-Do you know where Ariyan is?
-Who's Ariyan?

261
00:32:40,454 --> 00:32:46,804
The guys that came with motorcycles...
This music where's the sound coming from, could you take us there?

262
00:32:50,191 --> 00:32:52,590
-You're looking for Afshin?
Yes yes!

263
00:32:53,408 --> 00:32:57,824
They've made it a hell for us.
The cows have stopped giving milk.

264
00:32:58,826 --> 00:33:03,686
They're not eating or drinking.
They've become wild

265
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:09,371
It's the cows that are supposed to shit all over the place
But now it's these guys that are shitting all over us instead.

266
00:33:10,873 --> 00:33:17,247
Look! That animal's dyeing from famine!
Totally lost it's appetite, and we don't dare to go near to clean her.

267
00:33:18,334 --> 00:33:26,996
But Afshin he's a good kid and the owner.
Don't tell him anything he might be upset.

268
00:33:35,524 --> 00:33:38,022
-Guys! Ashkan and Negar.
-Hi!

269
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:42,084
No I came with you
but imagine what these went through to get here.

270
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:47,189
-Really it wasn't easy to get here.
-Well this is it, these neighbors threw us out and we had to come here.

271
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:59,851
-Play that Hesar
-No, really, Hesar? OK! Sure.

272
00:34:00,477 --> 00:34:02,847
Play it so the guys hear it
and we'll see...

273
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:14,175
You know the thing is that we started out doing Heavy Metal
but lately we changed it and have some more vocals.

274
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:24,285
We used to do a lot of heavier stuff before
but now it's more Farsi and we've made it to sync with our culture to attract the masses.

275
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:35,731
I think you know our aim.
We're looking to create a band and get it organized  and go abroad and perform.

276
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:47,192
That's great! OK we will play for you
and if you think this is something that fits you we'd like to help you.

277
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:51,063
-Should we sit down?
-Yes why not?

278
00:36:40,044 --> 00:36:44,656
-They play in a barn
-I'm really concerned that you all might have got some form of hepatitis.

279
00:36:44,657 --> 00:36:48,988
-You all have to be examined.
-I haven't got anything, but you guys...

280
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,088
-Don't you live together?
-No we're not living together, just play together.

281
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:58,269
You are crazy.

282
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,596
Playing music in a barn.

283
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:07,488
You would do it too if your neighbors threw you out...

284
00:37:12,771 --> 00:37:15,533
A little higher.

285
00:37:35,385 --> 00:37:42,719
No see! Put some more feeling to it
so it's better on stage.

286
00:37:43,291 --> 00:37:45,244
OK put it on again.

287
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,365
-No no no
-Come on Ashkan!

288
00:38:07,966 --> 00:38:12,902
Let it finish once.
You can't just stop it, I' lose the feeling.

289
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,851
-How should I respond to this mail?
-Tell me again what they had written.

290
00:38:53,616 --> 00:39:00,564
That it was supposed to be four English songs
and one in Farsi.

291
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:06,748
-Well then we have to work on one or two within these two weeks.
-But what do we do with the one in Farsi that we've made?

292
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:09,420
Nothing! There's nothing we can do with it.

293
00:39:15,075 --> 00:39:16,480
Hi Kouri!

294
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:25,242
Hi! How are you Sina?

295
00:39:27,975 --> 00:39:29,990
Hi! How are you doing?
Hi Kouri!

296
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:36,685
-What's going on here?
It's the neighbor, we're waiting for them to leave.

297
00:39:37,072 --> 00:39:46,558
They usually leave like one and half hour ago.
We can't play until they leave. They'll call the 110 police.

298
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:49,262
Really?
Where's Soroush?

299
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:50,189
There he is!

300
00:39:51,478 --> 00:39:54,150
Soroush!
How are you?

301
00:39:57,553 --> 00:40:00,048
Hi Sina!
What's up?

302
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:04,038
-Where's Nader?
He was supposed to here earlier, I don't know.

303
00:40:04,314 --> 00:40:11,505
-Were you setting up things now?
-Yes I threw in some clothes. Got to throw in stuff to isolate it.

304
00:40:11,832 --> 00:40:14,632
What happened?
Haven't they left?

305
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:17,549
An hour and they've still not left.

306
00:40:18,045 --> 00:40:21,557
It's really hard like this.
Why did you come here from Ekbatan?

307
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:26,954
-They caught us three times.
-They took us when we were three floors down, we weren't doing any harm.

308
00:40:27,499 --> 00:40:35,299
They confiscated our instruments.
But it wasn't just us affected after that concert.

309
00:40:36,407 --> 00:40:44,160
-How'd you set up this place?
-It was a hell doing it, sacks of chalk there and wood from the street across.

310
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:45,826
-But it looks good
-Yes it's ok!

311
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:56,245
-Kouri! I brought you an Enemy magazine.
-Thanks! Brilliant.

312
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:01,459
-Guys! They just left.
Ok let's go.

313
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:35,986
Kouri go and check if the powers down everywhere!

314
00:42:41,027 --> 00:42:44,433
-No seems that it's just here.
-I think it's my dad.

315
00:42:44,734 --> 00:42:49,812
-You want me to go and tell him?
-Yes go and tell him to put it on 15 more minutes.

316
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,351
-Sina does your father have any problem with you playing?
-No he doesn't but he's worried that they call the 110.

317
00:42:58,685 --> 00:43:04,489
this last months he's spent a lot of time
going down to the police station and bailing us out.

318
00:43:04,833 --> 00:43:09,682
I'm so ashamed of this.
Recently we have this neighbor with a kid

319
00:43:10,232 --> 00:43:14,841
that calls the cops on us.
It's really funny.

320
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:23,752
Whenever we start playing and he's alone
when his parents are at work, he calls the 110.

321
00:43:24,534 --> 00:43:32,275
-The power's back on.
-Turn on the AC! It's impossible without it.

322
00:43:33,675 --> 00:43:36,950
Sina your dad said 10 minutes, not 15.

323
00:43:38,264 --> 00:43:43,245
-What's wrong with this kid?
-I don't know he just calls the 110 when he's alone

324
00:43:43,962 --> 00:43:47,856
And when we go down to check what's going on
we see laughing at us through the window.

325
00:43:48,270 --> 00:43:53,003
-So now we know his routine.
-He's confused us with his toys

326
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:57,310
Instead of playing with his toys
he's got us and the police as toys.

327
00:43:57,726 --> 00:43:59,910
-Do you get what we are going through?

328
00:44:01,248 --> 00:44:05,039
Sina I wanted to ask you if it's ok
if we come here and play?

329
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:14,134
OK so that's not possible.
You know what we talked about on the phone last night

330
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:19,056
I wanted to see if you've changed your mind
and want to come with us.

331
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:25,283
See I have two problems to deal with
and I don't know how to fix it.

332
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:35,609
I don't even have enough time to play already.
Besides that I've got other issues to deal with that I can't go into details.

333
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:40,138
-What about Arash?
-He's right! Arash is extraordinary good.

334
00:44:40,227 --> 00:44:42,248
-Which Arash?
-Freakies drummer.

335
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,051
-I thought they had split up
-No! They're playing again.

336
00:44:45,346 --> 00:44:49,986
-Is he still good?
-Really good. He's extremely good.

337
00:44:50,612 --> 00:44:57,754
-Kouri how's your situation?
-I told you, I like your music and style.

338
00:44:58,534 --> 00:45:02,353
My problem's the passport
and the money to get it.

339
00:45:02,871 --> 00:45:09,576
-Nader will take care of the passport don't worry about that.
-Well if that's the case then OK.

340
00:45:10,078 --> 00:45:11,876
Guys please hold on it's Nader.

341
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,084
Hello!

342
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:16,052
Who is it?

343
00:45:16,268 --> 00:45:19,295
Police station?
Just friends!

344
00:45:19,618 --> 00:45:23,409
No we are not his customers.
No! Not at all!

345
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:26,783
-From the police station.
-What? He's arrested?

346
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,640
What do I know?
Seems like...

347
00:45:29,741 --> 00:45:35,665
-Don't worry about him.
-He'll handle it like always.

348
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:43,948
Hello sir!
Where's branch 36?

349
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:47,032
Turn right over there
and go up one floor.

350
00:45:47,297 --> 00:45:47,838
Thank you very much!

351
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,323
I swear to God those movies are Haram
are they not?

352
00:46:09,452 --> 00:46:11,739
There's just a couple of scenes
that children should not see.

353
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:14,068
-Are you mocking me?
God forbid, if I'm doing that!

354
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:19,946
You say 1800 movies are yours???
Haji sir! It's for private use only. God forbid if I'm lying!

355
00:46:20,254 --> 00:46:22,765
I swear to God and on my mothers life
that I'm not lying.

356
00:46:23,128 --> 00:46:30,972
And if you put them on you'll see
that one after the other is broken and the pixels get distorted.

357
00:46:31,363 --> 00:46:36,012
God's my witness that I've handed them in to fix them
and I've even washed them like dishes in the kitchen.

358
00:46:36,214 --> 00:46:37,850
-Your making it worse with these...
-I eat shit If I'm lying!

359
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:40,920
You're hiding the truth
and it's no help for you.

360
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:45,686
OK ok! I'll tell you the truth!
On the Qur'an, please help me.

361
00:46:46,062 --> 00:46:51,364
OK These movies are mine
I love movies and music and such things.

362
00:46:51,526 --> 00:46:54,667
But there are no bad or haram scenes
among these movies you have the prophets movie as well.

363
00:46:54,857 --> 00:47:02,473
You have Omar Mokhtar and other Muslim movies
like movies of Jesus, Moses, Noah, Jonas all these.

364
00:47:02,574 --> 00:47:09,705
American but good movies and because of American sanctions
I'm watching their movies as a defiance.

365
00:47:10,115 --> 00:47:13,008
I've got all the good movies from the Europeans
with their good actors.

366
00:47:13,209 --> 00:47:15,243
I swear on Imam Hussein
just watch one or two of these movies.

367
00:47:15,344 --> 00:47:19,509
OK let's leave those aside.
What about the alcohol? You drink as well!!!

368
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,968
Me drinking? God forbid!!!
ME? I swear on the Qur'an I don't drink.

369
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:27,245
I drink less alcohol than a dog.
How could I drink alcohol.

370
00:47:27,484 --> 00:47:29,606
You think I could drink this?
I swear it's not mine.

371
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:33,314
What is this? WHAT?
It's sealed! I haven't drunk it look!!!

372
00:47:33,682 --> 00:47:37,126
Shut your mouth!
So whose' is it then?

373
00:47:37,423 --> 00:47:40,304
How can I convince you I haven't been drinking?
I swear on Abbas it's not mine!

374
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:43,808
-OK 80 lashes...
-Have mercy! For Imam Hussains sake don't write 80 lashes!

375
00:47:44,073 --> 00:47:50,169
I'll tell you the truth!
I swear on my mothers life I've never tasted alcohol and wont do it either!

376
00:47:50,315 --> 00:47:53,617
I swear on the Qur'an that I have an Armenian friend
it's a guy and not even a girl, Sir Haji.

377
00:47:53,857 --> 00:47:58,401
I've been invited to him several times
he's shown me such great hospitality every time!

378
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:03,927
Today he was coming over and I wanted to make it up to him.
But I swear I will never do it again and I swear on the Qur'an that's the truth!

379
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:06,633
-Stop swearing on the Qur'an!!!
-I swear on my mothers life!!!

380
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:10,627
OK!
I fine you 1.5 million for your penalty and 75 lashes.

381
00:48:10,756 --> 00:48:12,330
WHAT?
1.5 million for what?

382
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:18,157
OK I copy CD's SO WHAT?
Don't you pity me at all?

383
00:48:18,382 --> 00:48:27,186
I'm not even worth those two Million Toman!
Listen!!! What the hell are these anyway, take them!

384
00:48:27,374 --> 00:48:35,817
The house that I live in and everything in it aren't worth 2000
yet you want to fine me 1.5 million Toman, where am I supposed to get that?

385
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:40,468
A dog is worth more than I am here
I'm garbage and you want to fine me 1.5 million?

386
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:44,144
Here take them all it's yours!
Go and have a look they're nothing

387
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:52,602
Yes I copy CD's and I have to do it to get by!!!
Otherwise let me work for you, get you water and clean your table!!!

388
00:48:52,603 --> 00:49:02,534
OK! because of what you say I decrease the fine to 150 000 Toman.
But if you say one more word I'll fine you the first verdict!

389
00:49:02,713 --> 00:49:07,272
-You don't have a previous record and this is your first time...
-What about the lashes Sir?

390
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,214
-I pardon that too.
-Let me kiss your feet Sir

391
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:16,307
-Get out of here now!
Let me kiss your hands! Please let me kiss your hands!

392
00:49:16,512 --> 00:49:21,617
-I'm your servant Sir
-Bring me the next one!!!

393
00:49:21,718 --> 00:49:27,661
Haji Sir!
Please can I recommend you to just watch those movies from an other angle?

394
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:34,595
Watch them from a spiritual aspect
and be aware of the art and innovation, and if you like it...

395
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:36,947
I'll watch them and tell you
Now get the hell out of here!!!

396
00:49:37,756 --> 00:49:40,761
Good by Haji Sir!

397
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:50,966
-Come on he pardoned you
-What kind of pardon? wanted to give me a fat fine so I had cry myself out of it!

398
00:49:51,242 --> 00:49:53,296
Sorry I'm late darling.

399
00:49:53,882 --> 00:50:02,051
-You could go for an installment
-Yes the way I cried I could end up be rewarded by him.

400
00:51:33,472 --> 00:51:39,353
-Are'nt you afraid they get here and catch you?
-For what? We're not committing a crime.

401
00:51:39,459 --> 00:51:42,986
We're playing our music
and we're not harming anyone.

402
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:51,149
-But if they arrest you they'll lock you away for a couple of months.
-It's safe here don't worry about it at all.

403
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:58,890
-Won't the sound disturb your neighbors?
-No it's isolated there and these walls he too.

404
00:51:58,991 --> 00:52:04,078
Some noise goes out back but that's OK.
Just watch out when entering and leaving cause of the neighbors.

405
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:06,786
-Do you want to have a concert here?
-Yes but how's that possible?

406
00:52:06,887 --> 00:52:10,358
Of course I can arrange it.
I'll squeeze in 400 people here

407
00:52:10,459 --> 00:52:14,051
-150 there and 150 here and...
-Can't get 400 here!

408
00:52:14,152 --> 00:52:20,722
I make two floors and squeeze them in
girls and guys...but of course separated as with Islamic norms, you like that?

409
00:52:20,823 --> 00:52:24,038
Sure if you can do that it's great.
What do you think?

410
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:27,739
-But we'd like to have a bigger concert.
-Negar darling! I'll fix that for you.

411
00:52:28,392 --> 00:52:31,868
I have the connections and can get the hall for it
with permits and everything.

412
00:52:32,535 --> 00:52:36,787
If you perform for 200 or 400 people here
you can test it do the same for 2000 later.

413
00:52:37,448 --> 00:52:40,816
-It's really good for you don't you agree?
Sure if it's possible it's really good.

414
00:52:40,917 --> 00:52:46,936
-Could you do this for Ashkan?
-I'll help you out for the concert

415
00:52:47,037 --> 00:52:50,808
-But to play with you will be a little difficult
I think Arash can do it though.

416
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:54,507
-Ya I can do it and I like Indie.
-Seriously? Nice!

417
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:59,146
There's just the one problem
and that's my compulsory military service.

418
00:52:59,247 --> 00:53:06,415
No problem! I'll handle that for you.
I'm getting Ashkans passport now. I'm fixing it!

419
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:13,651
-How much will cost me?
-Don't worry about it, we'll make concert and you can charge people...

420
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,420
-5-6 millions but don't worry.
-5-6 millions...

421
00:53:18,521 --> 00:53:22,030
Don't worry at all!
You just focus on your thing and I'll handle the rest.

422
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:27,302
Pouya about giving us the keys
are you sure it won't get you into trouble?

423
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:33,007
No! Just when you get here at nights
make sure you're very quite so no one sees you.

424
00:53:33,108 --> 00:53:38,876
-And when you're playing keep it a little lower.
-How do you intend to get the crowd in?

425
00:53:38,977 --> 00:53:45,876
-We invite them ourselves.
One of us will be outside and get a group of three or four inside in intervals.

426
00:53:45,977 --> 00:53:47,838
-You give out the address?
-No.

427
00:53:47,939 --> 00:53:49,719
-They just come and go?
-Yes!

428
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:53,769
Ok I'll handle that!
I'll handle the crowd.

429
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:58,253
And don't worry about your military service!
I'll fix it for you like I'm fixing Ashkans things right now.

430
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:35,988
He's great but most importantly he's a great humanitarian.
First class musician you get it!

431
00:54:51,524 --> 00:54:55,282
Play the guitar children!
Imagine you are playing yourselves!

432
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:29,755
Ok kids!
An applause for yourself!

433
00:55:31,158 --> 00:55:39,369
OK! Listen up children!
Practice this song for 15 minutes at home.

434
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:42,848
Then you rest for two hours
and train this song for another 15 minutes.

435
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:45,502
Today I'll leave a little earlier cause I have guests
and I have an errand and have to leave.

436
00:55:45,603 --> 00:55:49,999
Mehrad!
Come here please!

437
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,097
Play a 4/4 rhythm and work with them.
Kids! See you tomorrow and don't forget to practice!

438
00:55:54,093 --> 00:56:01,189
You know I'm shy and can't say it in front of the guys.
You've brought them from the other side of Tehran how can I say no now?

439
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:05,315
You know how busy I am!
I'm working here for four hours

440
00:56:11,571 --> 00:56:12,271
-You know those I had from before.
-That's eleven hours.

441
00:56:13,779 --> 00:56:18,736
-Well! And rest of the time I'm stuck in traffic.
-OK what can we do for them their starting a band?

442
00:56:18,737 --> 00:56:22,689
I love these guys a lot
the same way you love those children.

443
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,817
Like that yellow kid, did you see him?
I loved him, and the way he was tilting his head while playing.

444
00:56:26,918 --> 00:56:35,122
-You should how talented they are!
-They are angel all of them and also these two. This one and that one too!

445
00:56:35,223 --> 00:56:40,268
-I want to help them getting started and send them away.
-I'll do whatever I can!

446
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:41,993
So you're in!
No! please I told...

447
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,206
Khosro? What about Khosro?
Have you heard about Khosro?

448
00:56:45,696 --> 00:56:48,062
-Yes I want Khosro!
-What does he play?

449
00:56:48,163 --> 00:56:50,464
Yes Khosro the bald guy
he plays the drums.

450
00:56:50,565 --> 00:56:57,217
-But we have a drummer now.
-That one cancel and David maybe couldn't, anything can happen.

451
00:56:57,318 --> 00:57:01,412
David might not be able?
Are you kidding me we are leaving in 7-8 days!

452
00:57:01,513 --> 00:57:04,621
I didn't say David can't but who know.
There must be a plan B...

453
00:57:04,722 --> 00:57:10,529
Khosro can help you with everything.
Plays the drums, writes, has a nice voice and plays guitar and bass...

454
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,806
-So how can we find him?
-Last time one of the guys saw him in the metro.

455
00:57:14,911 --> 00:57:16,289
-What does he do there?
-Begging!

456
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:17,464
-You're kidding?
-I swear!

457
00:57:17,565 --> 00:57:19,298
Begging?
On the metro?

458
00:57:19,399 --> 00:57:24,239
Yes yes yes!
He's singing with sunglasses on and...

459
00:57:39,613 --> 00:57:43,718
Who am I?
A vagabond!

460
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:46,561
One lost in the outskirts

461
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:50,622
The most neglected of all

462
00:57:51,237 --> 00:57:54,483
in the soundless town of all

463
00:57:54,562 --> 00:57:56,005
From where?

464
00:57:56,275 --> 00:57:58,265
South of the town

465
00:57:59,366 --> 00:58:01,772
Where the breath's in a one-way road

466
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,531
Where dreams and hopes

467
00:58:05,932 --> 00:58:11,797
get caught and trapped in cages

468
00:58:12,142 --> 00:58:15,398
In middle of a crossing

469
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,980
tired and no where to go

470
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:27,013
in the crossroad that is one-way from all sides

471
00:58:27,214 --> 00:58:30,274
in the middle of a crossroad

472
00:58:30,475 --> 00:58:34,373
tired and no where to go

473
00:58:34,474 --> 00:58:43,150
in the crossroad that is one-way from all sides

474
00:58:44,151 --> 00:58:45,619
Who am I?

475
00:58:46,407 --> 00:58:47,421
A barefoot man

476
00:58:47,722 --> 00:58:50,952
full of question with no answers

477
00:58:51,913 --> 00:58:54,619
a hundred roads on the wall

478
00:58:55,263 --> 00:58:59,237
that drew in my dreams

479
00:59:11,398 --> 00:59:16,970
-Let me see now what you've done
-I just wrote something, start playing let's see if...

480
00:59:17,071 --> 00:59:19,475
I've made a brief with three cords.

481
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:27,476
OK is all set

482
00:59:29,595 --> 00:59:34,219
Go back again
take that one back again.

483
00:59:42,657 --> 00:59:45,516
Don't open it!
Let me first see who it is.

484
00:59:53,656 --> 00:59:54,311
Open up it's Kouri!

485
00:59:55,146 --> 00:59:58,947
Hi!
Hi! How are you Kouri?

486
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,231
Look at this place!

487
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:18,882
-No you played it wrong.
Should I play it the other way?

488
01:00:18,983 --> 01:00:22,565
-Yes you should hit the double Hi-Hat now.
-Yes right sorry.

489
01:00:45,066 --> 01:00:52,369
Ashkan we can count a lot on Babak
and if we tell him to get us Ehsans Studio it'd be really

490
01:00:53,853 --> 01:00:58,824
If he can do it it's great
but I don't think he can. It's always busy there.

491
01:00:58,825 --> 01:01:02,353
-Do you know how much they take?
-No but we can ask him.

492
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:08,229
-Do you have permit for this?
-Of course not, you can't get one for this.

493
01:01:08,351 --> 01:01:10,647
Why's that? What's the issue
cause your work should...

494
01:01:10,748 --> 01:01:14,748
Well we thought so too
but I don't know why they've got problems with it.

495
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:21,405
We even try to respect two things.
One; that it doesn't go against society norms

496
01:01:21,606 --> 01:01:23,624
and the other one is that it's not political.

497
01:01:23,725 --> 01:01:26,819
But it's not out of fear!
We really believe in this.

498
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,607
Well Ehsan's going to play
and you'll hear it yourself.

499
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:32,978
Do you got any tracks with
brass or harmonica sounds?

500
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:33,631
Yes!

501
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:36,564
-I informed you about Ashkans situation right?
-Yes.

502
01:01:36,665 --> 01:01:43,248
-So you're in and want to work with this?
-Yes I am all the way!

503
01:01:43,349 --> 01:01:52,197
But you know it needs planning
and no backing off in the middle of things.

504
01:01:52,298 --> 01:02:00,056
Look Ehsan! Don't even doubt it.
I assure you we're working wholeheartedly with this.

505
01:02:00,157 --> 01:02:10,053
We also want to have tracks with
wind and brass instruments with effects in the background.

506
01:02:10,354 --> 01:02:11,054
Sure!

507
01:02:11,703 --> 01:02:16,596
-What do you have in your tracks?
-I have diatonic, chromatic...

508
01:02:17,596 --> 01:02:19,204
OK guys!
Let's get it going and see how it is.

509
01:05:01,491 --> 01:05:06,825
And then if we want to get a permit
we have to have a couple of female back vocalists.

510
01:05:06,926 --> 01:05:10,444
-They don't ever give permit to a solo singing female.
-I've heard about that.

511
01:05:10,545 --> 01:05:14,243
We must have three four females
to accompany the female singer.

512
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:16,366
Otherwise they don't permit it.

513
01:05:17,524 --> 01:05:21,589
By the way I'm afraid we might have to
wait a couple of years for the guidance ministry like all the others.

514
01:05:21,690 --> 01:05:23,750
That's awful

515
01:05:24,498 --> 01:05:28,783
You see there's several ways.
Either you are a solo female singer or...

516
01:05:28,684 --> 01:05:29,518
Pull over now!

517
01:05:29,619 --> 01:05:33,277
-What do they want?
-What should I do?

518
01:05:33,478 --> 01:05:34,815
I don't know what they want?

519
01:05:37,084 --> 01:05:39,819
I don't know...

520
01:05:41,183 --> 01:05:43,669
Open the window
Yes?

521
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:46,164
I said open it!
Yes please?

522
01:05:46,265 --> 01:05:48,373
-I said open it!!!
-What's wrong Sir?

523
01:05:48,474 --> 01:05:53,667
-Sir kindly tell her to open it so I can see what's in the car!
-All right All right!

524
01:05:53,768 --> 01:05:57,426
Well hurry up then.
OK OK! What's wrong?

525
01:05:57,527 --> 01:06:00,129
What's that you've go there?
It's a dog what' the problem?

526
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:03,937
I know it's a dog
but don't you know dogs are prohibited on the roads?

527
01:06:04,038 --> 01:06:07,040
-Yes but why?
-It's an untouchable thing so why've you taken it with you?

528
01:06:07,183 --> 01:06:11,769
This dog's not one of those dogs
it's clean and vaccinated against!

529
01:06:11,870 --> 01:06:14,949
-It's ID:d and everything.
-Hand it over so I can see it!

530
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:22,608
-Hurry up Sir and give it to me.
-All right just let us do it first!

531
01:06:22,709 --> 01:06:25,678
Let's see
well lift it up.

532
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:29,017
Stop that!!!
Sir!!!

533
01:06:57,272 --> 01:07:00,534
Ashkan what should I do
his cell phone is turned of.

534
01:07:00,635 --> 01:07:04,560
-What? Really?
-Yes it's two days now that it's off!

535
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:08,596
-Did'nt you give the installment?
-Of course, I paid it yesterday.

536
01:07:09,886 --> 01:07:14,683
-So what should we do?
-I paid the money yesterday.

537
01:07:15,084 --> 01:07:20,173
Listen he's playing around with us
Why don't you get that?

538
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:27,571
We are in the middle of this now Ashkan
and we'll be finished if it doesn't work out.

539
01:07:28,107 --> 01:07:34,684
What are we going to do now
all this money we've spent and even paid for the studio.

540
01:07:34,785 --> 01:07:40,254
What has happened so far?
Where's the passports and visas he said he'd get us?

541
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:44,788
Ashkan!
Negar! Don't worry he's an honest guy.

542
01:07:45,746 --> 01:07:48,082
Ya right!
You say it's OK all the time

543
01:07:48,183 --> 01:07:52,669
You're just like him always saying everything will be work out.
From one day to another it's different answers.

544
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:57,350
"Mony on time! Mash David on time! Don't worry!
No problem!"

545
01:07:57,451 --> 01:08:03,000
Saying this with his fake English speaking show offs
really he is "ridiculous"...

546
01:08:03,101 --> 01:08:05,040
WHAT?
What did you say?

547
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:07,867
No! no mister Nader!
You "gossipment" behind my back!

548
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:10,505
Do I speak bad English?
Or you with your wacky accent?

549
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:12,195
I'm not from Ney York
still they can't speak as well as I do!

550
01:08:13,913 --> 01:08:16,463
So what that I speak English?

551
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:23,559
Yesterday I was searching for a female singer for you all day.

552
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:28,213
Now IF I couldn't get you a permit
for a concert or a cassette...

553
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:29,214
What???

554
01:08:29,315 --> 01:08:35,062
I said IF!!!
I'll get you a concert in house that'll help with travel money.

555
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:41,071
Tonight I'm taking to one of these house concerts.
It's two sisters and I want to show you how they're making money in this country.

556
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:09,927
David managed to get Hamed across.
Hamed the guy playing guitar.

557
01:10:12,102 --> 01:10:14,650
Open up it's me.

558
01:10:14,751 --> 01:10:16,270
Did you get in trough the roof?
Did anybody see you?

559
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:18,015
No everyone is asleep.

560
01:10:18,316 --> 01:10:21,600
-Are you sure?
Yes I'm telling their asleep!

561
01:10:21,701 --> 01:10:25,311
-I don't want your dad to get here like the last time!
-No I said they were asleep!!!

562
01:10:25,412 --> 01:10:27,891
Allright then get in now.
Are you all right?

563
01:10:27,992 --> 01:10:32,018
No how can I be all right?
I really have a bad feeling over this.

564
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:37,269
I don't think it'll work out in the end.
I say let's forget the album, we shouldn't put our hopes for it this much.

565
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:41,921
Come here and sit beside me.
Come closer.

566
01:11:04,381 --> 01:11:08,293
Get over here now!
Come!

567
01:11:08,394 --> 01:11:11,475
-Why'd you take so long?
-Dude it was traffic

568
01:11:11,634 --> 01:11:14,091
Theres no traffic here!
Now come! Hurry up!

569
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:17,268
I wanted you to get here and show you this.
It'll help you with three things.

570
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,813
This group that I'm introducing to you
have passport, visa and permit!

571
01:11:20,593 --> 01:11:24,081
Three year ago I went to London with them myself.
Ask them, I know London like the palm of my hand.

572
01:11:24,182 --> 01:11:26,225
-What did you do in London?
-I'll tell you now

573
01:11:26,226 --> 01:11:31,981
First off I can get you 1 000- 2 000 maybe 10 000 people
that can come here and watch you play live.

574
01:11:32,425 --> 01:11:33,914
You can get back all the David money by that!

575
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:36,755
Now you're going to see a biker that you know well
and your going to see his talent.

576
01:11:37,245 --> 01:11:38,624
Actually he even looks like Marlon Brando.

577
01:11:38,748 --> 01:11:42,070
Come and see what's going on.
All the time that I've told you not to neglect the bikers, now you see why!

578
01:11:42,271 --> 01:11:47,717
I know London like my the palm of my hand
and if you could take me with you now, fine!

579
01:11:47,718 --> 01:11:51,919
Otherwise "Don't forget me please!"
just call and I'll come and be your No1 agent.

580
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:54,710
-Hi!
-Negar! Ashkan!

581
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:58,846
These are the kings of Navai music!
Hi Sir! Play good now so you don't embarrass me!

582
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,867
Now sit down and see what we'll do!

583
01:14:50,188 --> 01:14:53,245
Hello hi!
Shut up!

584
01:14:53,798 --> 01:14:55,526
Sorry wasn't talking to you
it was a dog.

585
01:14:56,020 --> 01:14:58,029
What?
You didn't get the permit?

586
01:14:58,623 --> 01:15:02,420
Why?
You're simply going to throw them out of here?

587
01:15:02,521 --> 01:15:05,994
You want money, my life
whatever it is just say it and I'll give you that.

588
01:15:06,095 --> 01:15:08,816
You didn't get them even one permit.
Why?

589
01:15:08,917 --> 01:15:11,783
No concerts,  no albums
Haji I want to know what was wrong with their lyrics?

590
01:15:11,884 --> 01:15:15,406
Was it antireligious? blasphemy?
What was it, are you just without reason rejecting them?

591
01:15:15,507 --> 01:15:19,699
Thanks a lot!
Very well done!!!

592
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:25,430
Yes Ashkan my dear?
Tell me what's up?

593
01:15:25,531 --> 01:15:27,612
What?
You want to sell your equipment?

594
01:15:27,713 --> 01:15:29,732
You don't dare selling it!
It's your pride and you don't sell that!

595
01:15:30,382 --> 01:15:32,887
If you're in trouble I'll sell my stuff
it's my obligation.

596
01:15:34,339 --> 01:15:39,020
Listen! They didn't grant you any permits.
But don't tell Negar yet!

597
01:15:39,121 --> 01:15:42,967
I'm at place right now and will call you back.
Bye!

598
01:15:47,124 --> 01:15:50,844
Hold on minute.

599
01:15:54,215 --> 01:15:55,205
-Brother!
-Brother!

600
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:58,209
You're the king!

601
01:15:58,310 --> 01:16:02,737
I lost my breath until getting up here.
This far up?

602
01:16:02,838 --> 01:16:10,028
Came up here to get a better overview.
See the streets and roads from up here.

603
01:16:10,129 --> 01:16:14,353
So we can say that this is TEHRAN!
You know what I mean?

604
01:16:14,454 --> 01:16:18,195
A city that you can die in with pride!!!

605
01:16:18,296 --> 01:16:25,300
Ya just stand up hear and screaming so everything wakes up.
All the buildings and roads.

606
01:16:25,535 --> 01:16:29,283
And when singing underground
we do it so we can't be heard by those on the ground.

607
01:16:29,550 --> 01:16:42,433
Since long ago we've slept on these streets.
Everything's been here from making money to falling in love and the friendships.

608
01:16:42,534 --> 01:16:45,672
Believe me it's all from here
and you can't live without it.

609
01:16:46,483 --> 01:16:52,246
What we do my brother is called what?
Farsi Rap!

610
01:16:52,347 --> 01:16:56,147
And what does Farsi mean?
Means it's for this place.

611
01:16:56,888 --> 01:16:59,003
-Are you coming or what?
-No!

612
01:16:59,104 --> 01:17:09,539
Trust me, for me there's no thing like outside here
cause what I speak of is for heart of this place.

613
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:15,205
my brother it's an opportunity not to waste
a couple of guys are going to London and I'm helping them out

614
01:17:15,306 --> 01:17:19,967
They are short of a couple of members and a rapper.
And who's a better rapper other than you?

615
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:24,386
First of all, not a Rapper but Rap singer!

616
01:17:24,486 --> 01:17:30,375
-There's no way.
-And if there is?

617
01:17:30,476 --> 01:17:39,762
-OK so it didn't work out
-I owe you brother, but I'll around.

618
01:17:39,863 --> 01:17:43,588
It's ok! You go and do your thing.
I'll have to get going too.

619
01:17:43,689 --> 01:17:50,064
-Say hi to everyone from me!
-Sure! But still think about it.

620
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:53,193
I'll think about it
but my answer is no.

621
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,418
This is Tehran, a city
Where everything you see entices you

622
01:18:23,519 --> 01:18:28,318
entices your soul till you realize
you're not human, just trash

623
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:32,586
Everyine's a wolf wanna run like sheep?
Let me open your eyes and ears.

624
01:18:32,721 --> 01:18:38,188
This is Tehran, it's no joke.
No sign of flowers or popsicles.

625
01:18:38,323 --> 01:18:42,620
This is a jungle, eat or be eaten.
Half the people are hung up half savages

626
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:47,622
The class struggle is oppressive.
It saps peoples spirits.

627
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:52,560
Everyone takes a taxi
and refuses to pay.

628
01:18:52,695 --> 01:18:57,412
The truth is clear, don't go that route.
I'll make it clearer so sit still.

629
01:18:57,547 --> 01:19:01,910
God, wake up! I have things to say.
Don't get mad at what I've done.

630
01:19:02,145 --> 01:19:05,437
What part? I've just begun.
God, wake up, I'm trash!

631
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:11,357
A hobo stands next to a Benz.
He isn't worth enough to rent it.

632
01:19:11,492 --> 01:19:16,173
Me, you, him came from a single drop.
Look at the gap between us.

633
01:19:16,308 --> 01:19:20,697
It's not gravity that makes the world spin.
Money makes the world go around.

634
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:25,343
Today, it's money first, God second
for everyone, peasant and boss.

635
01:19:25,278 --> 01:19:30,516
A kid want to play with an orphan, dad says no.
His dirty clothes is all he has.

636
01:19:30,651 --> 01:19:34,906
We're all aware of these troubles.
But even angels won't come here.

637
01:19:35,041 --> 01:19:39,869
Till we've been destroyed by these troubles.
We don't want help, the tears fall.

638
01:19:40,004 --> 01:19:45,861
The disgusted soul knows what I mean.
I'm not done talking, come back.

639
01:19:45,996 --> 01:19:50,105
God, wake up and listen.
Don't get mad at what I've done.

640
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,441
What part? I've just begun.
God, wake up, I'm trash!

641
01:19:53,576 --> 01:19:59,973
Have you ever loved a girl?
I'll teach you a thing or two.

642
01:20:00,108 --> 01:20:04,038
You think this love is historic.
But your girl's seeing a rich kid.

643
01:20:04,173 --> 01:20:08,893
It's ok, forget it.
Forget everyone around you.

644
01:20:09,093 --> 01:20:12,776
A kid your age with a car, God laughs.
You wish in vain.

645
01:20:12,911 --> 01:20:18,856
"I wanna be rich, be rid of this complex."
Stop wishing, it's no use.

646
01:20:18,991 --> 01:20:23,166
Wanna sleep, look at these nightmares.
Let's curse this world together.

647
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:28,237
You're blind not to see vanity all around.
Poverty and prostitution on the street.

648
01:20:28,372 --> 01:20:32,918
God, wake up, I'm trash.
Where do you make your money?

649
01:20:53,898 --> 01:20:59,907
Hi Ahmad how are you?
Listen I want to sell my bike and I'm looking for Mamad.

650
01:21:00,108 --> 01:21:00,999
Mamad's one floor up.

651
01:21:30,164 --> 01:21:33,249
No matter where in the world I go
if I just have this soup then everything's fine.

652
01:21:33,743 --> 01:21:37,043
Get out of here you and your constant
"everything's fine" talk, keep reminding me of Nader.

653
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:58,839
We'll surely find a manager but it's not crucial
what's important is that we are together and play our music.

654
01:21:59,575 --> 01:22:03,548
If we have to we can even play in the streets
well in worst case don't you agree?

655
01:22:03,649 --> 01:22:06,622
-Please not in the streets.
-Why not it's not that bad!

656
01:22:06,723 --> 01:22:13,415
But believe me something good will happen
I'm really positive and have a feeling that it's great.

657
01:22:13,516 --> 01:22:27,575
I just wish I had a Rick and Backer
and then an Island

658
01:22:27,873 --> 01:22:33,019
With a blue sky and play there day and night
without anybody bothering you

659
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:38,585
Then having a chef making this soup in the morning
and for lunch this soup again with ghorme sabzi

660
01:22:38,686 --> 01:22:41,978
For dinner soup again with ghorme sabzi and fesenjoon.

661
01:22:50,216 --> 01:22:54,201
And you Arash!
If we go and get successful there, what will you do?

662
01:22:54,808 --> 01:23:01,706
Get a really room with really acoustic sound
with a Ludwig drum and two good masters.

663
01:23:01,807 --> 01:23:05,812
Bill Bruford on one side
and Danny Carey on the other side.

664
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:14,328
Then pack a refrigerator with energy drinks.
Drinking and drumming, drinking and drumming.

665
01:23:14,815 --> 01:23:21,388
-What about you Negar?
Me? Nothing just that this Nader gets our passports.

666
01:23:21,489 --> 01:23:26,622
-That's her only wish.
-If that's your wish it's going to work out.

667
01:23:26,723 --> 01:23:38,808
I have three wishes and one is the passports, or else she'll beat me up.
Then I'd like to go on tours everywhere with Negar.

668
01:23:38,909 --> 01:23:50,803
The last one is that we can go to Iceland together
and see the SigaRos that I have always wanted to see.

669
01:26:58,605 --> 01:27:06,325
Babak our problem's something else
But this misters only worry is for tomorrows concert

670
01:27:06,426 --> 01:27:13,477
Now it's three day we haven't heard anything from Nader.
His cell phone's off and he hasn't contacted us once.

671
01:27:13,578 --> 01:27:18,776
We're leaving in three days and don't have anything ready
no passports or visas and we don't know anything about...

672
01:27:18,877 --> 01:27:25,954
Sorry madam but wasn't is your wish
that you wanted to have a concert before leaving Iran and play for your parents?

673
01:27:26,055 --> 01:27:33,734
-Was'nt my idea, I said we could leave right away and...
-Kids! calm down is Nader the issue now?

674
01:27:33,835 --> 01:27:43,149
Did'nt I introduce him to you?
He's a reliable fellow but he always disappears a couple of days each month.

675
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:47,133
It's because of what he does.
Ask people here everybody knows that.

676
01:27:47,234 --> 01:27:51,988
-I saw him the day before yesterday
-It's because of his work

677
01:27:53,090 --> 01:28:05,057
-I went to his place today and left message in his mailbox...
Believe me there's no problem!

678
01:28:14,421 --> 01:28:20,420
-Kouri you fool where have you been!
-From yesterday until know I been under the AC.

679
01:28:20,521 --> 01:28:25,542
-Stop acting funny let me see what happened.
-Just wait and see what I've done for you.

680
01:29:26,297 --> 01:29:32,743
We thought it's better not to have the lights on tonight.
I got 200 candles for everyone to hold one.

681
01:29:33,747 --> 01:29:36,800
It'll be too depressing.
You don't have candles for live performances.

682
01:29:37,432 --> 01:29:46,342
Not at all it's so cliché with smoke and dancing lights.
Candles are a lot better.

683
01:29:46,443 --> 01:29:49,056
What's up?

684
01:29:51,518 --> 01:29:55,251
Nader?
Guys he says he's found Nader.

685
01:29:55,352 --> 01:29:59,617
Negar he says he's found Nader!
OK where is he?

686
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,510
Party? Where and when is it?

687
01:30:05,611 --> 01:30:11,399
Damn it we have a concert then...

688
01:30:13,361 --> 01:30:18,330
No no Babak I'll get there myself
you better get over here and I'll go.

689
01:30:18,331 --> 01:30:19,507
Where's it then?

690
01:30:28,699 --> 01:30:30,036
Could be that one.

691
01:30:31,158 --> 01:30:34,628
-For Gods sake be careful Ashkan, I'm afraid
What for?

692
01:30:34,729 --> 01:30:39,218
I couldn't sleep until the morning
because of nightmares last night.

693
01:30:39,719 --> 01:30:40,252
Easy I'll be right back.

694
01:30:40,353 --> 01:30:44,431
-Ashkan please hurry up OK!
Yes OK.

695
01:30:49,384 --> 01:30:52,536
Yes?
I'm with the barefoot guys.

696
01:31:19,205 --> 01:31:27,750
Sorry do you know Nader?
Nader CD? Go up!

697
01:32:37,174 --> 01:32:38,783
Nader!

698
01:32:48,574 --> 01:32:53,498
Negar is down there waiting.
I've been looking for you, get up now.

699
01:33:11,142 --> 01:33:15,281
Come on get up
you have to throw up.

700
01:33:32,626 --> 01:33:34,967
Nader why've you been drinking like this?

701
01:33:35,824 --> 01:33:37,582
Get up now
Sit down here.

702
01:33:37,683 --> 01:33:46,075
Why're you crying?
It's going to be fine!

703
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:52,481
We've got the money now.
My mother sent it to me.

704
01:33:53,777 --> 01:33:55,817
Listen we got eight tickets.

705
01:34:01,736 --> 01:34:08,282
-Dear friend I'm sorry
What are you saying everything's in order.

706
01:34:08,783 --> 01:34:09,283
Why are you crying?
You're fine!

707
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:36,234
Everybody please be quite for a moment.
Ashkan and Negar will be a little late

708
01:34:36,335 --> 01:34:40,118
So until they get here
we will start playing a little for you.

709
01:34:45,448 --> 01:34:48,887
Why are you cursing yourself?

710
01:34:51,357 --> 01:34:53,333
Nader Nader the police is here!

711
01:35:08,672 --> 01:35:09,956
Nader for Gods sake please get up!
