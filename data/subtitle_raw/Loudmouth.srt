[string music]

3
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,652
We begin tonight with a man
who's been called everything

4
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,196
from a troublemaker
and charlatan

5
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,323
to a one-person
civil rights movement.

6
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,866
Media manipulator,
a rabble-rouser,

7
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,618
a tireless harbinger
of racial discord.

8
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,580
A blabbermouth, a loudmouth,
too flamboyant, or an agitator,

9
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,956
a racist, a race-baiter.

10
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:23,166
- Yeah.
- [Interviewer]: Right?

11
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,334
- Oh yeah.
- All of those things?

12
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,293
Right.

13
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,129
The question that I
always hear from whites,

14
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,049
"Reverend Al, why do you
make everything about race?"

15
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,176
The white media has
painted Reverend Al Sharpton

16
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:35,929
with a broad stroke.

17
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:40,015
The Black media rejects
this negative image.

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,479
And the Black question
that's just as troubling is,

19
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,773
"Why are you doin' that?
Ain't nothin' gonna change."

20
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,982
And that's the price you pay

21
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:49,734
or that's the price
you want to pay?

22
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:51,777
That's the price you
pay for being someone

23
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,697
that gets involved
in a high-profile fight

24
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,074
all for things you believe in.

25
00:01:56,157 --> 00:02:00,245
It's somewhere between
these two questions

26
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,458
that I've had to do a lot
of my work in activism.

27
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,335
Many people in the
Black community see him

28
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:13,299
as reflecting the spirit of such
men as Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey,

29
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,261
Dr. King, and his mentor,
Adam Clayton Powell.

30
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,221
[Female interviewer]:
You're a civil rights leader.

31
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,141
And then there's this
other side of you, you know?

32
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:22,976
You live in a fancy place--

33
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,687
First of all, I don't see
that as a contradiction.

34
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,021
We fought for access.

35
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,816
I think he's in the
civil rights business.

36
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,026
I don't think he's
a civil rights leader.

37
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:37,115
To explain to whites that
every Black born in America

38
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,951
is born into "it's
all about race."

39
00:02:40,034 --> 00:02:44,831
[string music]

40
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:08,438
The story of the lion and the
hunter would be a lot different

41
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,400
if the lion could
read and write.

42
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,569
[President Lyndon Johnson]
My fellow Americans,

43
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:20,408
I am about to sign into law
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

44
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,286
The reason the hunter
always comes off glorious

45
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,163
is he's the one
that writes the story.

46
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:28,291
Let us close the
springs of racial poison.

47
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,502
[Sharpton]: The lion is
always depicted as less than

48
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:32,337
what he is.

49
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,841
Let us lay aside
irrelevant differences

50
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,259
and make our nation whole.

51
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:42,430
And that has been the
problem with many of us

52
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:48,937
that have fought the
system in various ways.

53
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:54,984
[indistinct chatter]

54
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,030
But the system writes the story.

55
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,157
[Reporter]: In more
than 100 cities,

56
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,283
violence broke out.

57
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,534
[Reporter]: Detroit is afire.

58
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,829
100 square blocks
are now under siege.

59
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:12,126
Looting, murder, and arson
have nothing to do with civil rights.

60
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,171
We've legitimatized
opposition to the police

61
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,216
and disobedience to law.

62
00:04:19,341 --> 00:04:21,344
Shoot me, goddamn it!

63
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,637
Dr. Martin Luther King

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,722
has been shot to death
in Memphis, Tennessee.

65
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,599
[Reporter]: What effect
Martin Luther King's death

66
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,558
has had on you?

67
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,854
They're bending over
backwards to idolize him.

68
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:34,190
- [Man]: I am!
- [Crowd]: I am!

69
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,817
- Somebody!
- [Crowd]: Somebody!

70
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,277
- I am!
- I am!

71
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,945
- [Crowd]: I am!
- Somebody!

72
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,906
I stand before you
today as a candidate

73
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,157
for the Democratic nomination

74
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:46,703
for the presidency of the
United States of America.

75
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,578
[applause]

76
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,373
I am not the candidate
of Black America,

77
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,500
although I am Black and proud.

78
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:55,628
The way to end
discrimination against some

79
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,715
is not to begin
discrimination against others.

80
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,800
[Reporter]: New York City
has more racial tensions

81
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,969
than any other American city.

82
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,388
Goetz shot four young
men on the subway.

83
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:06,764
The shootings on
the crime-ridden

84
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,142
transportation system
touched off a wide debate,

85
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,601
with some calling
the man a hero.

86
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,187
Reverend Sharpton
is a relatively new face

87
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,564
among New York activists,

88
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,399
{\an8}and is asking the US
Attorney to have Goetz indicted

89
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,319
{\an8}on charges of violating
the young mens' civil rights.

90
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,779
{\an8}Every time we come into a case,

91
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,114
the first thing we have to do

92
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,701
{\an8}is fight the wrong
narrative of the story.

93
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,953
{\an8}The issue here is
there was no mugging.

94
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,163
{\an8}They talk about subway punks?

95
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,082
Nobody proved they
were subway punks.

96
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:38,129
They would try to criminalize
and demonize the victim.

97
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,466
The issue here is there
was an illusion in his mind,

98
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,634
that he has a right to shoot
people with that illusion.

99
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:45,011
[Reporter]: Were
there racial slurs?

100
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,429
No, there were no racial slurs.

101
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,972
[Reporter]: Did anybody
say "nigger," the word?

102
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,474
Maybe the word
"nigger" was said.

103
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,183
If they behaved themsleves
in this neighborhood,

104
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,478
maybe they could walk
the streets and be free.

105
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,022
Is your community
racist, yes or no?

106
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,191
[Al Sharpton]: Every
fight that I've fought

107
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,527
to use for a bigger issue,
'cause people don't understand

108
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,321
that it's not just the case.

109
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,823
Is the criminal justice
system working for people?

110
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,866
[shouts of "No!"]

111
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,076
Eleanor Bumpurs,
Michael Stewart.

112
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,661
Nobody went to jail on any case.

113
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,747
{\an8}You are, though, a media animal.

114
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,041
{\an8}If you're an activist,
the media is a tool

115
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,417
{\an8}to get your message across.

116
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:20,296
{\an8}We've got to turn these
stations upside down!

117
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,383
They like to
fight, so let's fight!

118
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,052
We demand a special prosecutor.

119
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,220
{\an8}Special prosecutor.

120
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,347
{\an8}We need a permanent
special prosecutor

121
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,724
{\an8}to investigate racial crime.

122
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:38,398
Sometimes you have to
be loud to let people know

123
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,982
that is not the real story.

124
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,193
You people are making it racist.

125
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:43,569
{\an8}No one looked at it that way

126
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,655
{\an8}until you people started
to brainwash people.

127
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,281
{\an8}[Sharpton]: We
must deal with reality.

128
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,826
{\an8}Either we have a racial problem

129
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:54,122
{\an8}or Black people have a
mass hallucination going.

130
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,624
{\an8}All of our lives
you had to fight

131
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,419
to make sure that you
controlled the story.

132
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,130
And I want the
folks at CBS to know,

133
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,340
if you can't tell
the story right,

134
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,217
don't tell it at all!

135
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,678
One of these days
I'm going in the door,

136
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,721
and I'm gonna give 'em the news.

137
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,557
Al Sharpton has
some photographers

138
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,852
who are videotaping us as we
are being videotaped for you.

139
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,396
We don't know exactly
what purpose it'll be used for,

140
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,523
but we do wanna make note of it.

141
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,986
Because whoever wrote
the story is gonna write it

142
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,279
and slant it their way.

152
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,073
Good evening and
welcome to PoliticsNation.

153
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,450
As the impeachment inquiry

154
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,828
into President Trump's
abuses of power continues,

155
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:20,500
2020 candidates will
have to thread the needle

156
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:22,293
while campaigning with voters.

157
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:24,253
You and I may
disagree on politics,

158
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,048
but you're one of
the smart analysts

159
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,674
and observers of politics.

160
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,052
If the president is impeached,

161
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:35,306
how will it affect the 2020
election, general election?

162
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,350
Well, thank you, Al,
for the kind words--

163
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,227
I think you've got
happy birthday cheer

164

165
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,855
I appreciate that. Um, I--

Right, after the
TV show Saturday.

168
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,239
What I'm trying to say is

169
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,700
I want to do the TV show
from 30 Rock Saturday,

170
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,410
go down to and speak at Howard,

171
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,289
and fly back and do the TV
show again from 30 Rock Saturday.

00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,668
- Appreciate you, Rev.
- Thank you.

{\an8}- [Sharpton]: Hey.
- Happy birthday.

175
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,008
{\an8}What's up?

176
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,802
Everything good?

177
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,011
65, Doc.

178
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,221
[laughing]

179
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:19,141
You're going to my--your
first Grandpa's birthday.

180
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,477
Happy Birthday, Grandpapa!

181
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,312
You lookin' in the camera?

182
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,148
You like cameras already, huh?

183
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,444
This is for the
Democratic debate?

184
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:31,779
[Woman]: Yes.

185
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:34,115
It's the only one that
looks pretty decent.

186
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:37,326
[Sharpton]: Well,
let's go with it.

187
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,585
[siren wailing]

188
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:48,087
[phone ringing]

189
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,977
[Reporter]: What's so
special about having

190
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,771
some of your famous
friends here tonight?

191
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,232
[Sharpton]: It's always good
to have these kind of people

192
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,525
wish you a happy birthday.

193
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,944
We fight a lot.
We struggle a lot.

194
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,324
And for them to find some
value in our work is important,

195
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,868
especially now in this
day of Donald Trump,

196
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,455
where a lot of what we
have fought for is at risk.

197
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,332
It's time for all of
us to come together

198
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,250
and really show we're
gonna stand together

199
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,586
and protect voting
rights and civil rights.

200
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,795
One, two, three, four

201
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,631
[James Brown's Get Up plays]

202
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,799
Get up, get on up

203
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,801
Get up, get on up

204
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,595
Stay on the scene, get on up

205
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:40,348
Like a sex machine, get on up

206
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,683
[Man]: I watched you
on television, you're great.

207
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,727
I mean, really, really--
you're really good.

208
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,021
[Sharpton]: There's
one of the Central Park 5.

209
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,149
[overlapping voices]

210
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,610
[Sharpton]:
Randall, let him know

211
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,488
I'm mic'ed for a documentary,
so don't say nothin' stupid.

212
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,823
We told him.

213
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,452
{\an8}That's right!

214
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,037
{\an8}[Sharpton]: I raised you well.

215
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,706
{\an8}[laughs] Birthday boy!

216
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,458
Thanks for coming.

217
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,751
You know what I was thinking?

218
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,544
- We're still here.
- We're still here.

219
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,546
Man, we're still kicking.

220
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,881
[applause]

221
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,549
[Chuck Schumer]:
Raise your glasses

222
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,552
to the great and
wonderful birthday

223
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,263
of Reverend Al Sharpton!

224
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,266
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

225
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,726
{\an8}I wanna say a few things.

226
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:31,857
{\an8}First, we know how much he
has done to defend civil rights,

227
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,444
{\an8}to defend the America
of its highest ideals.

228
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,697
{\an8}Are you in any way
predicting a long, hot summer?

229
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,198
{\an8}You're not predicting
urban strife.

230
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,617
{\an8}You're not predicting
disorder, or anything like that?

231
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,494
Well, what I'm
saying is, you know,

232
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,955
at home, you have an oven.

233
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,873
You have flames
on top of the oven.

234
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,709
And then there's
heat in the oven.

235
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,087
We always discuss whether
there'll be a flame on the top,

236
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:56,882
and don't discuss that it's
already 600 degrees inside.

237
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:00,094
And he has been
relentless in doing that

238
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,638
for close to 50 years.

239
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,098
[cheers and applause]

240
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,976
I'm not concerned as much
about a long, hot summer,

241
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,311
because it's been
a long, hot winter.

242
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,439
How do we cool
the long oven out?

243
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:12,857
Let's not wait for the explosion

244
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,526
and then just cut the
flames off upstairs.

245
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,819
Let's put the flame out inside.

246
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,363
Thank you, James Brown,
for being with us again.

247
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,949
{\an8}I spent my entire
career working in media.

248
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,619
{\an8}I've been at NBC News
for almost 35 years.

249
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:30,458
{\an8}I always tell people, if you
wanna understand the media world

250
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,126
and how it's changed,

251
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,172
you follow the life of
Reverend Al Sharpton.

252
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,465
"Hate on Earth."

253
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,966
That's how the New
York Daily News described

254
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,761
a savage racial attack in
New York City last weekend.

255
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:43,012
The attack took place

256
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,764
in a predominately
white neighborhood.

257
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,683
The victims were three Black
men whose car had broken down.

258
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,226
[Richard Valeriani]: The
Howard Beach section of Queens,

259
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,978
where the attack occurred,
is an almost all-white

260
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,938
working class neighborhood
near Kennedy Airport.

261
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,232
And it is known for
its hostility to Blacks.

262
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,693
The three Blacks were
attacked outside this pizzeria

263
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,028
after midnight Friday.

264
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,905
They had walked about
3 miles to the pizzeria

265
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,074
in search of a telephone
after their car broke down.

266
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,951
One of the victims,
Cedric Sandiford,

267
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,662
told the newspaper
Newsday the attacker houted,

268
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,664
"Niggers, you're in the
wrong neighborhood!"

269
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,667
He said he was hollering,
"God, don't kill us!"

270
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,919
Griffith will be
buried tomorrow.

271

[camera shutters clicking]

273

[police radio chatter]

274
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:39,401
[Sharpton unintelligible]

275
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,821
We must now go to the next step,

276
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,572
that is vigilence.

277
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,907
We must be there Monday.

278
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,160
We must stay on Santucci.
We must not let Cuomo be silent.

279
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,831
I'm very upset that the
governor is not here tonight.

280
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,165
The governor comes from Queens.

281
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,000
The governor hasn't
opened his mouth yet.

282
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:58,128
We must not leave here
tonight saying the funeral is over,

283
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,048
they're gonna have a race
harmony parade tomorrow,

284
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,467
and whoop-de-doo, we
must say we're gonna be at

285
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,844
Santucci's door Monday.

286
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,304
We're going to monitor
the lawyers of the family

287
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,808
and Santucci, and make
sure that justice is done.

288
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,892
This is serious.

289
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,853
Racism is alive and
well in New York.

290
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,230
We just buried a boy. And
the only thing he did wrong

291
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,316
was he was born on the
wrong side of the tracks.

292
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,110
How do you feel about
the press conference earlier,

293
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,572
Attorney Maddox to make
comments on the allegations?

294
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,739
[Sharpton]: I heard...

295
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,577
There was always
these racial incidents

296
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,829
and racial boundaries.

297
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,248
We knew not to go in
certain neighborhoods.

298
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:39,753
Fights between various
segments of the city and Blacks.

299
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,881
[police radio chatter]

300
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:46,135
When I graduated
junior high school in '68,

301
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,053
I couldn't go to school
the first two months

302
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,640
because there had
been a teacher strike.

303
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,100
The Black Community School Board

304
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,687
wanted to fire some white
teachers in Brownsville.

305
00:14:56,770 --> 00:15:00,482
And the teachers had a
strike, closed the schools down.

306
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,942
[Reporter]: What kind of scars

307
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,569
do you think this
is gonna leave?

308
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,404
Yes, there will be scars.

309
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,364
The teachers must realize that

310
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,700
the communities must be heard.

311
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:14,371
This kind of trauma
and back-and-forth

312
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,707
was the climate in New York.

313
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:17,833
[Ed Koch]: Good morning!

314
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,419
I'm Ed Koch running for mayor.

315
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,545
I need your help.

316
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,963
Nice to say hello.
How am I doing?

317
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,215
[Sharpton]: In the '80s, Ed Koch

318
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:29,094
immediately cut a
lot of the programs

319
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,930
that serviced our community.

320
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,514
We had Neighborhood Youth Corps.

321
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,808
We had Manpower
Training and Development.

322
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,143
We had Model Cities.

323
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,228
Many of these things
Adam Clayton Powell had

324
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,899
put through Congress called
the Anti-Poverty Programs.

325
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:45,945
Koch would run around, talking
about, "They're poverty pimps."

326
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,072
"They're misusing public funds."

327
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,783
If we had given
to the poor people

328
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,369
all the money that
we had appropriated

329
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,705
for the poor people,
the poor would be rich!

330
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,417
Instead, we allowed
poverty pimps to skim it off.

331
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,631
And he was a Democrat,
but he could play to that side.

332
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:07,424
And that created tension.

333
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,510
[chanting]

334
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:14,473
[Sharpton]: That led all the
way up to Bernhard Goetz, '84.

335
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:17,267
'85 was the mayor's race.

336
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,144
And '86 was Howard Beach.

337
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:23,857
And I barely went home to
change clothes since then.

338
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:26,235
{\an8}[chuckles]

339
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,030
{\an8}[Man]: We know how
Howard Beach are.

340
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,281
{\an8}Howard Beach is no joke!

341
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,117
They never welcomed Black
people in this neighborhood.

342
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,327
See a Black person,
a colored person,

343
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,997
first thing is you yell
at them, you know?

344
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,957
This is the way it is
in this neighborhood.

345
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,709
We had great
leaders in New York--

346
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,877
Adam Powell, Malcolm X, and all.

347
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,965
But I wanted to expose
what they spoke about.

348
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,051
{\an8}Black is beautiful.
Black is beautiful.

349
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:56,682
{\an8}We're gonna walk side by
side with you or through you.

350
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,144
{\an8}It's gotta be with
dignity and integrity!

351
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,312
We don't want any
more than you have,

352
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,107
and we're not gonna accept
any less than you have.

353
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,401
It's one thing to
have a great orator

354
00:17:07,483 --> 00:17:11,320
that talks about the
wickedness, the hatred of people.

355
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:15,034
It's another thing for you
to make them put them lens

356
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:18,787
and show these guys
calling you a nigger

357
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,789
in New York City, in the '80s.

358
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,626
[shouts of "Nigger!"]

359
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,461
Racism, huh?

360
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,670
Tell the fucker go home.

361
00:17:26,753 --> 00:17:28,881
- Go home, niggers!
- No media, go home!

362
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,299
This is who they are.

363
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,635
This is who keeps us
from going to good schools.

364
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,429
This is who makes us have

365
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,724
certain levels of
employment we couldn't get.

366
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,476
This is who they really are.

367
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,812
This is your street? Fuck you!
White street! White street! White street!

368
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,230
[Jesse Jackson]: Given
the racism in the country,

369
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,608
we are the last hired
and the first fired.

370
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,568
In times of war,
the first drafted

371
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,153
and the first to die.

372
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,405
When the nation
proper is underemployed,

373
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:57,618
we're unemployed, and then
stigmatized for being that way.

374
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,953
[Sharpton]: All
of the activists,

375
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,123
the ones that I've
studied and emulated,

376
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:07,586
came at a time when
what we wanted to say,

377
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,172
people did not want to hear.

378
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,466
So you had to be loud

379
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:17,054
because you were not
invited to address the public.

380
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,430
Reverend Sharpton has organized

381
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,058
a youth rally for tomorrow
afternoon in Howard Beach.

382
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,769
He says it's to show the
public that young Black men

383
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,896
have the right to
peacefully demonstrate

384
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,733
in the predominantly white
section of Howard Beach.

385
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,318
[Man]: I want you
to start assembling

386
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,363
so we can start distributing
the armbands to the marchers.

387
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,698
[Sharpton]: I could've
made a speech,

388
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:38,742
but I decided we'd go out there

389
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,703
and let them make
the speech for me.

390
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,622
[indistinct chatter]

391
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:53,715
No, no. Don't put
words in my mouth.

392
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,384
I'm not saying that.

393
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,762
I'm just saying they had
no business at that time,

394
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,223
four hours after
their car breaks down,

395
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,975
to be eating pizza over there.

396
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,103
Just because this is Howard
Beach, an all-white community,

397
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,565
the media is what
caused all of this!

398
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:15,445
[crowd shouts "Equal
rights for whites!"]

399
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:24,663
[chants "Howard Beach, have
you heard, this is not Johannesburg]"

400
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,251
[Man]: Fucking bullshit!

401
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,212
Peace? You want a piece of us?

402
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,882
You motherfuckers!

403
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,846
{\an8}These are people who are saying
that they are opposed to someone

404
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,514
{\an8}being killed by a mob,

405
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,392
{\an8}and there's actually community
residents who would come out

406
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,020
to support somebody
being killed by a mob.

407
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,523
I mean, that's a kind
of collective insanity.

408
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,152
That's a whole
community that's nuts.

409
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,820
Which is what racism does.

410
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,740
{\an8}It drives the racists crazy.

411
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,618
{\an8}All right?

412
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,414
We're gonna ask all the
people to be in the green area.

413
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,750
Please cooperate with security.

414
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,627
{\an8}[Sharpton:] Everybody sing

415
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,049
{\an8}Amen, amen, amen

416
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:20,260
{\an8}Remember Michael Griffith

417
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,513
[Sharpton]: I was baptized
by Bishop Washington

418
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,848
when I was three.

419
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,143
The next year is when
I started preaching.

420
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:30,854
And I've been
preaching ever since.

421
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,440
A little bit louder

422
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:36,985
All a preacher does
is take biblical stories

423
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,406
and use the story to therefore
get to the moral message

424
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,034
or ethical message
they're projecting.

425
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,245
I transfer that
into social justice,

426
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:49,915
whether it is Michael Griffith
being killed in Howard Beach

427
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,584
or whether it's somebody
choked to death by a cop

428
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,628
in Staten Island years
later, Eric Gardner.

429
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:58,590
It is the story, but the
issue is racial violence.

430
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,052
But you need the story
to make the issue live.

431
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,512
[shouting]

432
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:09,017
Can we hear now from Reverend--
our singing minister--Sharpton?

433
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,352
Reverend Al Sharpton.

434
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,981
Al Sharpton. Brief words.

435
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:19,111
Twenty years ago,
World War II ended,

436
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:24,992
with one race of people at their
Holocaust saying, "Never again."

437
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:29,579
We've heard for 40 years
people remind us of that

438
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,834
while we have been raped,
while we have been murdered,

439
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:38,297
while we have been exploited,
while we have been denied.

440
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,093
Here we stand in New York City,

441
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,469
Howard Beach,

442
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,640
where people used to come
from the South for opportunity.

443
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,601
Where people used to
come from the Caribbean

444
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,062
feeling their problems
would be over.

445
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,355
Now they don't even know

446
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,442
if their children can
get home at night--

447
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,944
not because they
did something wrong,

448
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,655
but because of the
color of their skin.

449
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,451
I come today to say
to Governor Cuomo,

450
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,288
who's been silent
during this whole crisis,

451
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,123
who hasn't opened his mouth,

452
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,459
even though he
comes from Queens.

453
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,919
He's got political laryngitis.

454
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,796
To Mayor Koch
and the rest of them,

455
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,509
that we did not have our
children to be target practice

456
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:28,555
for some white mobs that
can't behave themselves!

457
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:31,933
Never again will
we come and weep!

458
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,185
We will organize!

459
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,103
We will go to the precinct!

460
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,646
We will go to Santucci!

461
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,648
We will go wherever we got to go

462
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:42,652
until you leave
our children alone!

463
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:46,031
Next day, front page of
The New York Times--

464
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,241
they had been
ignoring all of this stuff--

465
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,162
was us standing in front of
that pizzeria in Howard Beach.

466
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,915
[Mason] Howard
Beach, have you heard?

467
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,333
You are Johannesburg.

468
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:59,503
[Sharpton]: It was at that
rally I met Mason and Maddox.

469
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,922
And they said, we
have a legal strategy

470
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,924
of noncooperation.

471
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,343
You keep doing what you
doing, we'll do what we're doing.

472
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,929
[Reporter]: Attorneys Vernon
Mason and Alton Maddox,

473
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,139
representing the
surviving victims,

474
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,225
says Sandiford
and Timothy Grimes

475
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,559
would not testify

476
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:17,854
until Governor Cuomo
appoints a special prosecutor.

477
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,773
{\an8}People know that in this city

478
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,193
{\an8}that no white person
has ever been convicted

479
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,569
{\an8}of murdering a Black person.

480
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:29,282
The argument was that the
local Queens district attorney

481
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,994
was not gonna indict these kids

482
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,414
because he did
not want to offend

483
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:36,873
the voters in Howard Beach.

484
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,459
[Reporter]: Some believe
that Blacks are responsible for

485
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,628
most of the crime in their area.

486
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,756
{\an8}When they rob us, nobody
does anything about it.

487
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,259
{\an8}There are white racists,
there are Black racists.

488
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,718
{\an8}But the vast majority of people

489
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,638
{\an8}in every one of those
groups is decent.

490
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:54,683
I think that unfortunately,
Howard Beach was inevitable.

491
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:58,645
It's an inevitable result
of a national climate

492
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,314
{\an8}of an absence of national
leadership which says,

493
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:05,527
{\an8}people's rights, people's
civil rights, must be protected.

494
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,821
{\an8}A lot of white people
can't understand this.

495
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:13,034
{\an8}New York City is the
Birmingham of the '80s.

496
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,619
{\an8}[Sharpton]: We felt the only way

497
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:18,457
that we would get
an impartial grand jury

498
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,128
is if someone outside of
the politics of the county

499
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,172
were to investigate the case.

500
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,758
If you can't prosecute
the lynch mob for murder,

501
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:33,305
the Griffith family does not
want anything less than that.

502
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,475
Nothing can work, and nothing
can work as it should, at least,

503
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,477
without Sandiford testifying.

504
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,147
Why did Dr. King march
from Selma to Montgomery

505
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,817
when they could've
flown in in an hour?

506
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,277
[shouting]

507
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,154
[Sharpton]: It
was that daily walk

508
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,573
that arrested the
attention of the country.

509
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:56,411
People are marching in Alabama
for the right to vote, day one.

510
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,788
Day three, they're
still marching.

511
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,874
It was drama.

512
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,501
[shouting, chanting]

513
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,211
And I'm bringing
all of this into

514
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,338
what we were doing in New York.

515
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:10,759
The Post called us
loudmouths yesterday.

516
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:14,888
But I think if the Post
understands history,

517
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,306
They will understand that

518
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:19,601
they're putting us in
some good company.

519
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,395
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

520
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:27,859
{\an8}We're coming. The
summer is here.

521
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,820
{\an8}And we have a new saying.

522
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,490
- No justice--
- [Crowd]: No peace.

523
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,450
- No justice--
- [Crowd]: No peace.

524
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,410
- No justice--
- [Crowd]: No peace.

525
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:41,414
We'd finally got to where
the legal strategy worked

526
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:42,791
as we kept agitating.

527
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,502
Governor Mario Cuomo
appointed a special prosecutor.

528
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:46,878
This is a special episode.

529
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,756
It has lifted tensions
to a special level.

530
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,925
It requires a special response.

531
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:57,097
And that's what we intend by
all that we have done here today.

532
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:04,062
[string music]

533
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,569
[Man]: So I'm gonna turn
your speaker up a little bit.

534
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,861
[Sharpton]: Okay.

535
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:12,571
[Man]: Okay.

536
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,781
[Man]: Airing commercial.

537
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,157
[chatter]

538
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,450
[Man]: Okay, we're back.

539
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,579
This Wednesday, MSNBC
and The Washington Post

540
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,331
are cohosting the
next presidential debate

541
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,958
in Atlanta, Georgia.

542
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:25,917
The event will feature

543
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,503
the leading 10
Democratic contenders,

544
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:33,383
and I will be there front and
center for all of the action.

545
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,385
- Hi, how are you doing?
- I'm good, how are you?

546
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,637
I'm all right. How y'all doing?

547
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,805
{\an8}Good, how are you doing?

548
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,640
{\an8}- All right, how's everybody?
- Good to see you.

549
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,726
{\an8}Did you-- Did you
call Holly and them?

550
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,644
'Cause I want to go
in the media room.

551
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,646
- I'm following you?
- Yes, sir!

552
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,982
Martin! I think I
changed my mind.

553
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,027
I'm gonna announce
tonight I'm gonna run again.

554
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,111
[laughing]

555
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,571
That's not a bad idea.

556
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,282
[Woman]: We'll send
Yolanda to be your cabinet.

557
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,658
Cabinet?

558
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,410
She gonna be on
top of the ticket.

559
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,453
I'm gonna be--

560
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,705
[laughing]
- -vice president.

561
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:07,334
[indistinct chatter]

562
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,794
We love you in
Savannah, Georgia, man.

563
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,839
- Thank you.
- You don't come enough.

564
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,801
- Thank you, sir.
- All right, thank you.

565
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:17,969
How are you?

566
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,512
Marty Baron, Washington
Post. How are you?

567
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,431
- All right, how you been?
- Good.

568
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,433
You might wanna get the shot.

569
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,935
They got me sitting between
the chairman of the party

570
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,062
and the mayor.

571
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:30,190
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]

572
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,196
{\an8}[indistinct chatter]

573
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,327
{\an8}[Sharpton]: Candidate for
2020 presidential nomination

574
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,329
Andrew Yang.

575
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,830
Amy Klobuchar.

576
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,499
[Amy Klobuchar]: Thank you!

577
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,250
Tom Steyer.

578
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,712
Senator Cory Booker.

579
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,383
Pete Buttigieg.

580
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,391
This election is going to be

581
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,894
one of the most important
in American history.

582
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,648
And certainly the most
important in our lifetime.

583
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,901
Voting rights is under attack.

584
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:20,365
And this president has put over
150 federal judges on the bench,

585
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,784
most of who for a lifetime.

586
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,746
If we don't fight and raise
the level of conversation

587
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,375
to where it oughta be,
then who's gonna do it?

588
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,876
That's why I wanted us to hear

589
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,461
some of the
candidates this morning.

590
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,714
All of them came to
our national convention.

591
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,924
But I wanted some
to come and greet us,

592
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,970
because I still say the strength
of our community, the backbone,

593
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,056
is and always has
been the Black church.

594
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,099
[Man]: Definitely!

595
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,684
[Sharpton]: But Reggie's
preaching this morning,

596
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,352
Don't let me get going.

597
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,437
[laughing]

598
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,730
[applause]

599
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,399
- [Woman]: Thank you, Reverend.
- Thank you.

600
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,362
[Reginald T Jackson]:
My brothers and sisters,

601
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:03,366
our nation is on the
verge of shipwreck.

602
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,784
- [Man]: All right.
- [Man]: Yes, sir.

603
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:08,580
[Jackson]: And it's imperative
that the Black church

604
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:13,293
again be the
conscience of the nation.

605
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,711
[audience affirming]

606
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:19,632
[Jackson]: God did not
just call us to be priestly.

607
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:24,471
He also called
us to be prophetic.

608
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:30,393
Too many of us are
content just to be priestly.

609
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,729
We don't wanna rock the boat!

610
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,690
We don't wanna
challenge the system!

611
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,568
Maybe they'll give
us a proclamation.

612
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,946
Maybe they'll invite us
to give the invocation.

613
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,617
Maybe they'll invite us to
lunch at the governor's house.

614
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,538
But God has called
us to be prophetic.

615
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,707
To speak truth to power.

616
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:54,793
[applause]

617
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:59,130
Brothers and sisters,
2020 is gonna demonstrate

618
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:03,676
whether we are
prophetic or pathetic.

619
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,848
[audience affirming]

620
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:13,311
[Jackson]: God wants
us not only to praise him!

621
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,647
He wants us to serve him!

622
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:21,486
That's why I like the name,
the National Action Network.

623
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,364
We've gotta have some action!

624
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,115
We gotta go to work!

625
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:31,287
We've gotta turn the
world upside down!

626
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,873
Black leaders are planning
massive demonstrations

627
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,459
in New York tomorrow
to protest what they say

628
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,253
is rampant racial violence.

629
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,672
The demonstrations come
as a decision is awaited

630
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,967
in a racial attack case that's
getting national attention.

631
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,927
{\an8}Richard Schlesinger
has our report.

632
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,762
{\an8}[Richard Schlesinger]: One
year after Michael Griffith died,

633
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:51,182
{\an8}a jury is still trying to decide
if a gang of white youths

634
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,852
chased him to his
death on a busy highway,

635
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:56,729
{\an8}or if it was all just
a tragic accident.

636
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,524
{\an8}After 11 days, there
is still no verdict.

637
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,818
{\an8}My feeling is that
we're coming to an end.

638
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,611
[Schlesinger]: Black
activists who have watched

639
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,322
the trial closely plan a mass
demonstration tomorrow

640
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,699
to tie up traffic,

641
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:11,619
despite a judge's order hastily
issued today to stop them.

642
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,871
We marched in Howard Beach.

643
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,455
And we were called niggers.

644
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,665
They threw sticks at us.

645
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,333
Nobody gave them
a restraining order.

646
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,628
No one has been restrained
through this whole crisis

647
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,963
but Black leadership.

648
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,673
[Reporter]: Mr. Maddox,
what's your reaction, sir?

649
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,258
[Maddox]: The police
department informed us

650
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:29,345
that we do not have the right
to freely travel on certain days.

651
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:32,348
The First Amendment to
the United States Constitution

652
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,683
is being trampled upon.

653
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:37,103
The nerve of them to use
legal apparatus on the victims

654
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:39,856
while they still have not
addressed the victimizers.

655
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:43,735
So he can get his best
handcuffs ready for me tomorrow.

656
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:46,029
We intend to block the bridges.

657
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,114
We intend to block
subway trains.

658
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,742
We intend to block the
Long Island Railroad.

659
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,702
And we intend to send
Johnson and Ben Ward

660
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:55,830
their order back, so the
next time they have diarrhea,

661
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,625
they can use a box of
Maalox and this order.

662
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,501
[laughing]

663
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:08,968

664
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,890
[Man]: I want you
to line up behind

665
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,392
the brothers and
sisters in the front.

666
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,645
Listen to me very carefully.

667
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:21,230
The entire area is
surrounded by the police.

668
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:23,191
And there are many
who are not in uniform.

669
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,902
There are many inside the march.

670
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:30,865
Their plan is start a
contradiction in the march.

671
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:35,453
If anyone starts any shit in the
march, get 'em out of the march.

672
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:39,540
We will not allow them to
deter what we are trying to do.

673
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,294
And most important,
be courageous!

674
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,879
Be fearless!

675
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,255
Don't let anybody down!

676
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,174

Get out of the way!

Turn you around, turn you around

Turn you around

00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,649
Don't you let nobody
turn you around

691
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,984
Keep on walking

692
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:57,118
[shouts of "No
justice, no peace!"]

693
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:12,300
[shouts of "No peace!"]

694
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,222
[Sharpton]: We're here!

695
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:23,101
This train will not
move until they move us!

696
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:28,190
They arrested 214
of us on false charges.

697
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,735
So if they can't ride us fair

698
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,652
they don't need to ride!

699
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,782
[shouting]

700
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,244
[shouts of "No
justice, no peace!"]

701
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:45,166
{\an8}Brothers and sisters...

702
00:34:45,248 --> 00:34:48,503
{\an8}This is the most
monumental occasion.

703
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:52,172
{\an8}This is a most
monumental occasion.

704
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:55,467
This is the beginning of
a civil rights movement

705
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,511
in the city of New York.

706
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,139
{\an8}Michael Stewart was killed
in one of these tunnels.

707
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,100
{\an8}And we are here in his memory.

708
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,310
We're here in the
memory of Michael Griffith,

709
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,771
of Yvonne Smallwood,
and all the countless others

710
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,524
whose lives have been
taken away from us

711
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,818
by racist oppressors.

712
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,737
This city will never be
the same after this day.

713
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,864
{\an8}For 10 years, for 10 years

714
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,950
{\an8}we marched up and
down these streets.

715
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,411
For 10 years, for 10
years, we demonstrated.

716
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,790
So now we've raised it to
the level of civil disobedience.

717
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:27,542
You talk bad, Ben Ward!

718
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,918
You talk bad, Koch!

719
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,797
You came in the midnight
hours and served us.

720
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,924
Now we're here to serve you.

721
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:35,967
Come on with it!

722
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,552
We're ready to go.

723
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,053
We told you we'd be here.

724
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,054
We're here!

725
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,639
We ain't taking no more!

726
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,849
[Crowd chants:] We're fired up!

727
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,225
We ain't taking no more!

728
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,227
We're fired up, we
ain't taking no more!

729
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,229
We're fired up, we
ain't taking no more!

730
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,815
Fired up, we ain't
taking no more!

731
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:51,941
Fired up!

732
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,776
[clapping]

733
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,361
[Male anchor]:
Echoes of a verdict.

734
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:57,530
They rode over New
York and the nation today

735
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:00,533
after a jury convicted
three young white men

736
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:01,826
and acquitted a fourth

737
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,120
in the death of a Black
man just a year ago.

738
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,539
That fatal outburst
of mob violence

739
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:11,002
etched the words "Howard Beach"
on the nation's consciousness.

740
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,503
And the anger, white and Black,

741
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,297
didn't end with
the jury's verdict.

742
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,882
[Reporter]: Mason
and other Black leaders

743
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,258
spent the night in jail.

744
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,467
They were arrested yesterday

745
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,137
when a group of
about 500 protestors

746
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,763
blocked rush hour traffic.

747
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,724
It was called a Day of Outrage--

748
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:29,145
outrage which continued today
despite attempts by city leaders

749
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,730
to put the best
face on the verdict.

750
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:33,649
Mayor Koch says he's not
gonna give any special treatment

751
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,319
to any of the people
arrested in the Day of Outrage.

752
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:39,822
The Day of Outrage,
as they refer to it,

753
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,949
took place before the verdict

754
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,242
in the Howard Beach case.

755
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,620
They were knocking
it, condemning it, before

756
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,121
they knew what it was.

757
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,832
Is that the way to get your way?

758
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:52,585
To demonstrate and
to impose yourself?

759
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,547
'Cause I don't think that's
what Blacks or whites want.

760
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,216
[Reporter]: It would
be safe to say, though,

761
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,675
that you're not hailing
last night's verdict

762
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,135
as justice in New York City.

763
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,428
We want to hold comment.

764
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,722
We have to bury Yvonne Smallwood

765
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,140
tomorrow night in the Bronx.

766
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,726
28-year-old Black
mother of four children

767
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,729
beaten to death by New York
City policemen in the Bronx.

768
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,357
And so we're gonna have
this funeral tomorrow night.

769
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,068
This struggle of racism and
racially motivated violence

770
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,569
in New York City
is not over with.

771
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,322
The Howard Beach verdict
does not end anything.

772
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,408
[indistinct chatter]

773
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,500
We have everything
in this movement.

774
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,004
We have nationalists.

775
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,173
We have revolutionaries.

776
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,384
We have people who want
to overthrow the government.

777
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:47,473
[shouting, cheering, applause]

778
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,226
And the reason why
we will continue to have

779
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,852
everything in this movement,

780
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,229
because it frightens white folks

781
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:56,816
when we have everything
in this movement.

782
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,610
[cheers and applause]

783
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,322
It lets white folks know that
we might be Malcolm today

784
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:05,324
and Martin Luther King tomorrow.

785
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,369
[cheering, shouting]

786
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,874
[applause]

787
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,460
Those that oppress us

788
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:20,172
had the nerve to
try and advise us

789
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,677
on how we ought to
try to get free from them.

790
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,053
[laughing]

791
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:31,684
[cheers and applause]

792
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:39,859
[Sharpton]: We are
intelligent enough

793
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,194
not to let you tell us

794
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:47,408
what tactics that you
are comfortable with

795
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,327
to hold us in slavery.

796
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,371
[cheers and applause]

797
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,374
[Sharpton]: You don't have
none of us under control.

798
00:38:55,458 --> 00:39:00,713
[cheers and applause]

799
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,218
And you will never have
us under control again.

800
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,389
[cheers and applause]

801
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,101
[Sharpton]: That
was Howard Beach.

802
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,272
It felt like a victory,

803
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,776
but you knew that
you won a case,

804
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:24,987
not changed the system.

805
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,489
I'd been in the
movement since 12,

806
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:30,951
and I knew the difference
between moments

807
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,412
and movements that won.

808
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:37,083
So it was a good
momentary victory.

809
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:41,504
[cheers and applause]

810
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,091
But I knew there was
no structural change

811
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,635
in the criminal justice system.

812
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,305
{\an8}If you had some
advice for young people,

813
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,808
{\an8}what would you tell 'em?

814
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,602
{\an8}Well, first thing I'd say,
get yourself together,

815
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,563
because before you can
get anything else together,

816
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,818
you gotta get me, I, yourself.

817
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,654
Hey, that's very short,
but it's very direct.

818
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,364
We have a young
man in the studio

819
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,283
who I think is an
astounding young brother

820
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:15,204
because of his youth,
he's only 19 years old,

821
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,580
and he's accomplished a lot.

822
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,000
And he's here to make a
presentation to James Brown.

823
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,378
And we'd like to
welcome him warmly.

824
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,881
His name is Al Sharpton.
How about it for Al Sharpton?

825
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,135
[applause]

826
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:33,055
Al is the national
director of...

827
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,974
- The National--
- The National Youth--

828
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,976
- Movement.
- Movement, Incorporated.

829
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,352
- Right, Al?
- That's right.

830
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,645
And what do we have here?

831
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:43,274
Well, we come
to break tradition.

832
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,443
We know that in the
recording industry

833
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,735
that they give a gold record

834
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,363
to those that achieve
a million seller.

835
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,241
But we view your
million seller, Payback,

836
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:55,244
as a Black record, because
it is relevant and says

837
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:58,289
many of the things that
young Blacks have tried to say

838
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:02,418
and could not musically
express in our own little way.

839
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:05,963
And we feel The Payback is
sort of the like the theme song

840
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,549
of young Black America in 1974.

841
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,759
[cheers and applause]

842
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,679
[Sharpton]: James
Brown was the biggest,

843
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:18,893
most regarded, legendary
Black star in the world at that time.

844
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:24,899
And this was at one of
the lowest points in my life.

845
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,359
- Where were you born?
- Brooklyn, New York.

846
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:29,320
[Charlie Rose]: Yeah,
your dad left you--

847
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,488
When I was 10 years old.

848
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,114
[Rose]: And how
does that shape you?

849
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:33,657
How have you lived with that?

850
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,659
Well, it is certainly something

851
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,538
that makes you reach outside
of your home for male figures.

852
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:42,291
[Sharpton] I woke up one
morning. My father had left.

853
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:46,670
He had left with my
stepsister, and they had a child.

854
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:51,383
It impacted me more than
I would admit to myself.

855
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,053
When my daddy left,

856
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,555
my mother became
mother and father.

857
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:01,018
Sixty percent of young
African children grow up

858
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,145
with just their momma at home.

859
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,272
{\an8}Hello, Rev. This is your mother.

860
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:08,192
{\an8}And I think so very much
every time I hear you speak,

861
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,777
{\an8}every time I see you perform,

862
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,904
{\an8}every time I see
your lovely work--

863
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:15,324
I just think about how
good God has been to me

864
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,910
now and through the
years that I delivered you

865
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:19,578
for these, our people.

866
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:24,542
[Sharpton]: I was
looking for a father figure.

867
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:29,213
The wisdom of my
mother was she understood

868
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,343
that if she didn't guide me
around the right male figures,

869
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,930
that I was, because
of this hunger,

870
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:42,518
would seek them out, and it
might be negative male figures.

871
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,270
- Where did you grow up?
- [Sharpton]: In Brownsville,

872
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,564
which is probably the
worst part in the city.

873
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,317
Mike Tyson came out of there.
And you know, I'm 37 now.

874
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,444
Most--I can't
think of two friends

875
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,029
{\an8}that are not either
in jail or dead.

876
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,449
{\an8}[Sharpton] So when she
brought me to Bishop Washington,

877
00:42:57,533 --> 00:43:00,119
{\an8}and he brought me
to a Reverend Jones

878
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,412
{\an8}and a Jesse Jackson,

879
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,748
{\an8}that was because she
was smart enough to say,

880
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,834
{\an8}"He's gonna need
that in his life."

881
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:11,589
My Father's Day is about those
that have fathered our community.

882
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,506
[audience affirming]

883
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,632
[Woman]: That's right!

884
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,635
Those that pay the extra price.

885
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:20,806
Those that have done
what needed to be done,

886
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:24,685
even when others
were not willing to do it.

887
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:27,271
I always gave her credit,

888
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:33,360
that this uneducated
Black woman from Alabama,

889
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:37,615
never studied child-rearing,
never studied psychology,

890
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,575
but she knew that.

891
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,578
We got too many
young people in America

892
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,914
who do not have two
parents to look up to,

893
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,541
and there's only so many hours--

894
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,586
And that problem is
compounded by a young mother

895
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,504
who is now being unemployed,

896
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,882
whose job's been given
to international markets,

897
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,383
who has no daycare help,

898
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,469
who has no type of assistance

899
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,720
from the federal government.

900
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,305
So he has no role model.

901
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,765
His mother can't
take care of him.

902
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,517
He's thrown in the streets
with no educational program.

903
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,854
He watches television that
gives him a digest of violence.

904
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,774
And then he's incarcerated
when he takes TV's advice

905
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,193
and picks up a gun and
plays Have Gun - Will Travel.

906
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,446
Probably if he had not left
and they had stayed together,

907
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,115
I would have been a
much different person,

908
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,784
'cause I probably
would've never known

909
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,118
the difference of zip codes.

910
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:26,246
I would've never saw the
father figure in Adam Powell,

911
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,333
or Jesse Jackson,
or James Brown.

912

[chatter]

913
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,507
[Sharpton]: And I understood
what a lot of people

914
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,716
didn't get to understand.

915
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:41,220
I knew both sides of
the Black experience.

916
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,596
There's one thing about you is

917
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,848
I know as long as you're
involved, I'm involved.

918
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,392
I'm committed to
you 'cause I know

919
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,976
you're trying to do something.
- Thank you, sir.

920
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,811
I sure thank ya.

921
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,562
[Sharpton]: I learned
from James Brown

922
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:54,400
that if you really
find your rhythm

923
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:58,195
and find what you
believe in and what you do,

924
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:04,368
that sooner or later, the
world will cross over to you

925
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:06,704
rather than you
cross over to them.

926
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,748

[ mournful vocalizing ]

929
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,495
People have called
for charges to be laid,

930
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,955
but this crowd is
wondering what does it take?

931
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,666
Back before there were video,
they could understand that.

932
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:35,751
Now they can't.

933
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,127
People are calling
it a lynching.

934
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,046
[Anchor]: Frustration
over the lack of charges

935
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,132
against the officers
turned into anger overnight,

936
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,510
{\an8}and it all comes as Minnesota
and the rest of the country

937
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:47,846
{\an8}are facing the dual toll
of rising jobless claims

938
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,640
{\an8}and cases of coronavirus.

939
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,643
{\an8}All you need is probable
cause to make an arrest.

940
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,103
{\an8}And there is no reason
why these four policemen

941
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,523
{\an8}should not have
been arrested by now.

{\an8}"When the looting
starts, the shooting starts."

951
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,423
{\an8}These criminal
acts are not protest.

952
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:25,342
{\an8}They are not statements.

953
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,427
{\an8}Does this violence help?

954
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,679
{\an8}It doesn't help anything,

955
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,681
{\an8}but it lets you know
that they're tired!

956
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,475
{\an8}They're tired of being
oppressed, being misused,

{\an8}being abused, being
murdered at will!

958
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,146
{\an8}What do you mean by
"Justice should be served"?

959
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,442
{\an8}I'll leave that to the
justice system to work out.

960
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,987
{\an8}There's this tinge
a horrific irony,

961
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,907
{\an8}to hear calls for
tranquility and status quo

962
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:51,159
{\an8}when justice has still
not been delivered.

963
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,996
I'm not gonna pretend
for a millisecond

964
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,124
to know what it's like to be
a Black person in America.

965
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,250
I don't.

966
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:01,378
But the only thing I do know
is that we all need to do better.

967
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,462
We need to love more.

968
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,424
We need to respect
more. Do better.

969
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,675
So part of what we have to do

970
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,594
is try to understand
the context.

971
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,137
[Tucker Carlson]:
Oh, the context.

972
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,639
And squint your eyes as you
said. "The context." Of course!

973
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,434
There's a context to
setting fire to McDonald's,

974
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,727
says Professor Gloud.

975
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,480
I think that this could
be a tipping point

976
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,982
to have this conversation.

977
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,109
But you cannot
have a conversation

978
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,986
until these officers
are arrested

979
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:28,739
{\an8}and show that we are
dealing on a playing field

980
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,992
{\an8}that is even and that
is fair to everyone.

981
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,828
{\an8}Without that, it's
talk with no action.

982
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,371
We don't just need
a conversation.

983
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:42,169
We need the implementation
and execution of the law.

00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:18,408
It's not enough just to keep
showing the activist part

1031
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,744
if the legislative
part is not there.

1032
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,537
What made the 60s significant

1033
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:26,166
is with all the marching,
and the drama, and the rallies,

1034
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,960
we got the Civil
Rights Act of '64,

1035
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:32,798
the Voting Rights Act of
'65, open housing of '68.

1036
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:36,259
We have not had the
legislative response

1037
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:39,179
to the litany of
cases of policing

1038
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,056
all the way from
Rodney King to now.

1039
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:43,183
It's time to be able
to translate that

1040
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,145
into legislation, not
just conversation.

1041
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,568
[Schumer]: I'm gonna send
everybody a speech I just gave

1042
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,986
on the floor of the Senate,

1043
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,365
where I was really strong
against the president.

1044
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,493
[Skype jingle]

1045
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,538
[phone ringing]

1046
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:05,872
Hello?

1047
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,207
[Derrick Johnson]:
Hey, Rev, how you doin'?

1048
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,127
Hey, how you feelin'?

1049
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,670
[Johnson]: I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

1050
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:15,006
I wanna start by saying that
the way you maneuver, man,

1051
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:18,093
I'm loving it. I've
watched it, I'm learning.

1052
00:52:18,176 --> 00:52:22,848
Uh, I need to get some lessons
'cause you--you damn good.

1053
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,767
Well, coming from the
president of the NAACP,

1054
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,561
I take it as a
compliment, Derrick.

1055
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:30,939
Well, America, we are
about to open the door

1056
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,400
on our beloved city
called New York.

1057
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,570
Mr. Sharpton was
one of several arrested

1058
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,906
in a blocking of the
Brooklyn Bridge at rush hour,

1059
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,535
not to mention a couple
of subway trains here.

1060
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,744
[some applause]

1061
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,955
For which he gets an applause

1062
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,874
which does about
a two and a half

1063
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:51,585
on the old popularity meter.

1064
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:54,462
So we do 8 minutes...

1065
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,924
and 34 seconds
during the funeral.

1066
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,301
[Johnson]: 46 seconds.

1067
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,595
No, well, I don't
know. You tell me.

1068
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,722
Right before, right after?

1069
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,891
Hold one minute,
hold one minute.

1070
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,642
Hello?

1071
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,810
[Jesse Jackson]: Hey Al.

1072
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:11,062
Hey, Reverend,
how are you doing?

1073
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,398
Hold one minute,
hold one minute.

1074
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,109
Yeah, that's Jesse
on the other line.

1075
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:17,485
Let's get this straight.

1076
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:21,156
New York now has visible,
politically active Black people

1077
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:25,076
who are not only speaking,
they are actually causing,

1078
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,246
on some--few
occasions, purposely,

1079
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:33,668
disruption of our city's life
not unlike the disruption,

1080
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,378
or peaceful demonstrations,

1081
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:37,422
that were led by
Martin Luther King, Jr.

1082
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,507
[Johnson]: What's the
call to action out of it?

1083
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:43,428
We're talking about calling
for big march and rally

1084
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:46,389
on August 28, the anniversary
of the March on Washington,

1085
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:49,684
as I jump off for voting
registration nationwide.

1086
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:53,521
We talking about 200-300,000
people in Washington.

1087
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,315
[Johnson]: Yeah,
no, this is your space,

1088
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,775
this is your space.

1089
00:53:56,858 --> 00:54:00,070
It should surprise no one that
Mr. Maddox, Mr. Sharpton have,

1090
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:03,323
at various times,
been called hot dogs.

1091
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:06,326
You're out for
your own publicity,

1092
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:08,995
and you're just
causing a lot of trouble,

1093
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,997
and you're overdoing
this race thing.

1094
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,124
{\an8}After all, we're
all God's children.

1095
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,628
{\an8}Let's hold hands and
move on into the future.

1096
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:17,796
{\an8}Well, I think--

1097
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,925
{\an8}I think the charge of hot
dogs could be really put to rest.

1098
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,469
{\an8}If these cases did not exist,

1099
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:28,640
{\an8}there would be no reason
for us to come to anybody.

1100
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:32,269
{\an8}The media catches us in
motion. They don't start the motion.

1101
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,689
{\an8}And we've been marching long
before the media covered us.

1102
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:36,564
{\an8}[applause]

1103
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,067
[Sharpton]: In
the '70s and '80s,

1104
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,528
you had the racy kind of show.

1105
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,156
[jeering]

1106
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,536
The Donahues, Richard
Bey, Morton Downey.

1107
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,245
[jeering]

1108
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:51,413
Now please zip it.

1109
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,290
We're gonna let
everyone talk tonight.

1110
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:55,000
And that's what the
loudmouths are for.

1111
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,584
Let these guys talk first.

1112
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,253
You can't debate
first before I give it.

1113
00:54:58,336 --> 00:55:00,672
[Richard Bey]: Well, it's
not an answer, it's a story.

1114
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,589
Go on and tell me.

1115
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,300
{\an8}[Sharpton]: No, it is an answer.

1116
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,051
{\an8}What's the difference
between a "fag" and "nigger"?

1117
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,803
{\an8}You wouldn't sit still
for the word "nigger".

1118
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:12,684
{\an8}And sometimes we had to
go on the racy kind of shows.

1119
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,102
{\an8}No, I won't apologize.

1120
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:16,730
{\an8}In the manner in which I
use it, I do not apologize.

1121
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,772
{\an8}[cheering]

1122
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:21,318
{\an8}You just applauded a white
for refusing to apologize

1123
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,652
{\an8}for using the word "nigger".

1124
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,613
{\an8}Do you realize what
that does for America?

1125
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,283
[Sharpton]: The polished
shows wouldn't have us on

1126
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,868
'cause they didn't
wanna talk about race,

1127
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,955
and they certainly didn't
want to talk about it to people.

1128
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:35,665
that were going to
tell them the truth.

1129
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:40,045
This business of racism is
not new, and it's systemic.

1130
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,005
You have to know that.
You have to know that

1131
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,548
you're even unaware
that you're a racist.

1132
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:47,385
They would have these guys
that will hoot and howl at you

1133
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,012
in the studio audience.

1134
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:52,932
And I am sick of you
people promoting racism

1135
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,351
on its highest level,

1136
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:56,895
and that's exactly
what you're doing.

1137
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,897
[applause]

1138
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:03,443
So it was that kind of almost
confrontational television.

1139
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,529
You weren't here to help
build up America, most of you.

1140
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,282
Your grandparents
were, right along with me.

1141
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,659
And you wouldn't know
what it is to be Black.

1142
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:14,496
That's why you can sit up
and say what you're saying.

1143
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,957
You don't know what it is,
and you may never know,

1144
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,209
because you're not Black.

1145
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:20,835
[Sharpton]: We went
through everywhere else.

1146
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,170
Richard Bey was all available.

1147
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:25,173
And the question is, you
do that, or you do nothing.

1148
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:26,758
We're not asking you to like us.

1149
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,136
We're saying that we should
be protected under the law.

1150
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,808
Whatever America is,
white folks created it.

1151
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:35,850
We did not.

1152
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:38,895
It's a combination of
things that created racism.

1153
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,021
[Donahue]: Like what?

1154
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,398
Well, okay, you
have, as you said,

1155
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,982
the whites created the world--

1156
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,151
or created America,
I agree with you.

1157
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,194
[shouting]

1158
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:47,946
Wait a minute, can
I make my point?

1159
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,155
Can I make my point?

1160
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,157
I am feeling for you.
I am very empathetic.

1161
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:55,829
But then you had the buttoned
down more sophisticated network types

1162
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,580
that talked very measured.

1163
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,333
It seems to me that part
of what you two gentlemen

1164
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,584
are trying to do is perhaps

1165
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,711
to change the legal
system in the street.

1166
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:06,381
We're trying to
establish the fact

1167
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:08,466
that there is a
prevalent racial--

1168
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,301
[Ted Koppel]: My question
was, whether you're trying

1169
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,929
to change the legal
system in the streets.

1170
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:13,847
[overlapping voices]

1171
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,014
I'm trying to answer you.

1172
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,599
[Sharpton]: But
had the same basic

1173
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,018
exclusion of Black thought,

1174
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:23,440
the distorted depiction of race.

1175
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:27,235
They just did it in a
more polished way.

1176
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,695
[Bey]: This morning's
newspapers,

1177
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,822
"Sharpton 'The Informer'
is as an entertaining racist"

1178
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,782
"playing the race
game for fun and profit,"

1179
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,452
"the way generations of white
Southern racists played it."

1180
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,744
There was a joke going around

1181
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,079
that was in the
Wall Street Journal,

1182
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,414
repeated in Esquire magazine.

1183
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,250
What do you do if you
have Saddam Hussein,

1184
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:44,377
Muammar Qaddafi,
and Al Sharpton,

1185
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,796
and in your hand is a
gun with two bullets?

1186
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,466
The answer is you
shoot Al Sharpton twice.

1187
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,510
[Sharpton]: So if you go back
to the '80s and '90s in New York,

1188
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:58,141
and you go to the editorial
room that decided the news,

1189
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,685
they were all white.

1190
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,812
Why would they help
a Black movement

1191
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,858
that they know would come to
get them for racial exclusion?

1192
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,027
The media is really
manipulating people

1193
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,196
to feel and think a certain way.

1194
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,238
Nobody's controlling me.

1195
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,865
Nobody comes
down here and says--

1196
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,533
- [Sharpton]: Come on, Richard.
- [Mason]: You need to wake up.

1197
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,285
You mean you're
doing this on your own?

1198
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,495
That's right!

1199
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,913
Okay, all right.

1200
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:23,041
[Sharpton]: The way
you discredit a movement

1201
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:26,544
{\an8}is you discredit those that
are in front of the movement.

1202
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:30,215
{\an8}Former president Truman
was quoted by the AP

1203
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:34,010
{\an8}as saying that the march
from Selma was "silly."

1204
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,845
{\an8}The march was not silly at all.

1205
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:37,514
[Sharpton]: Martin
Luther King, Jr.

1206
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,766
National holiday in his honor.

1207
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,893
You read books on
Martin Luther King.

1208
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,271
Isn't it interesting they
never say he was indicted

1209
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,942
{\an8}for income tax fraud and
misappropriation of funds?

1210
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:51,528
{\an8}They don't want you to
remember the first thing they did

1211
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,696
{\an8}was try to make him a crook.

1212
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,533
{\an8}He had to go on trial
and get acquitted.

1213
00:58:56,616 --> 00:59:00,036
Adam Clayton Powell,
indicted for income tax evasion.

1214
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,412
The gentleman's question was

1215
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,206
that if the case
goes against me,

1216
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,333
could it be used
against me politically?

1217
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,960
You answer him, please?

1218
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:07,919
No!

1219
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,755
Marcus Gravey ran out
the country for a fraud.

1220
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:14,717
So either all Black
leaders are crooks,

1221
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,595
or there's the
playbook to discredit us.

1222
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,641
Sharpton is back in the news,
arrested for grand larceny.

1223
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:22,934
[Reporter]: Sharpton appeared in

1224
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:23,893
Manhattan Criminal Court,

1225
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,229
and with lawyer Alton
Maddox at his side,

1226
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,689
heard the charges against him.

1227
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,983
It's my induction into
the Activist Hall of Fame.

1228
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:34,612
There was too much
evidence that they knew better

1229
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:36,864
than what they were projecting.

1230
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,158
{\an8}They knew that I
started in Breadbasket.

1231
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,119
{\an8}They did articles on me.

1232
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,539
{\an8}Cut that part out that

1233
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:46,416
{\an8}that he grew up in the
King movement in the north.

1234
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:49,168
{\an8}We will not sit by and watch
them shoot 14-year-old boys

1235
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,670
{\an8}in the streets any longer.

1236
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,297
{\an8}Start him mid '80s.

1237
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:54,591
[Reporter]: Who is this
33-year-old preacher

1238
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,717
without a church?

1239
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,261
[Sharpton]: They had to redo me.

1240
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,972
This is just a guy conning.

1241
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:03,182
You know, he was in show
business with James Brown.

1242
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,727
This is just performance.

1243
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,938
At first, I resented it. But
then I came to understand

1244
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:11,357
that the people
writing the stories

1245
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:14,444
was part of the
institutionalized bias

1246
01:00:14,527 --> 01:00:16,237
I was fighting.

1247
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:17,655
[Male anchor]: To
most white New Yorkers

1248
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,366
and a sizeable number of
Black New Yorkers as well,

1249
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,493
he is little more than
a pudgy exhibitionist

1250
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:25,496
who can be counted on to
show up, bullhorn in hand,

1251
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,248
at every racial incident.

1252
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,958
So who is Al Sharpton anyway?

1253
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:32,503
[Sharpton] The
objective was to stop

1254
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:35,673
raising the issue of race

1255
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,884
because they were guilty.

1256
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:42,764
They had made a
intentional decision

1257
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,849
to protect the status quo,

1258
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:48,686
'cause the status quo
was protecting them.

1259
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,735
{\an8}[chanting] Stop the
rape! Stop the lies!

1260
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,029
{\an8}Women of color on the rise!

1261
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,197
{\an8}Stop your rape!

1262
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,323
Stop your lies!

1263
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:03,076
Women of color on the rise!

1264
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,411
Good afternoon, everybody.

1265
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,788
{\an8}I'm really glad to be here.

1266
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,832
{\an8}I'm here because, like
all of you, I'm pissed off

1267
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,378
{\an8}and I'm mad as hell at what's
happening to our people,

1268
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,505
to our women,
and to our leaders.

1269
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:20,551
So this is in support
of our Black sister,

1270
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,594
Tawana Brawley.

1271
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:26,724
[cheers and applause]

1272
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:44,033
[applause]

1273
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,766
[applause]

1274
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,768
They're gonna continue
taking advantage of her

1275
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,562
'cause she's Black.

1276
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:13,938
Since the people are white,

1277
01:02:14,021 --> 01:02:16,774
they're dealing with the
political campaigning,

1278
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,943
they're gonna pay
the white judge,

1279
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,863
and the white judge is
gonna throw the case out.

1280
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,865
But as long as we're
here to fight for her,

1281
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,950
it will not be thrown out.

1282
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,535
[Reporter]: Last
November, Tawana Brawley

1283
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,746
was found dumped along
a road in Dutchess County.

1284
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:32,039
She was wrapped in a
feces-covered plastic bag.

1285
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:34,208
Racial slurs were
scrawled on her body.

1286
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,044
Her family claims that she
was abducted by six white men

1287
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:39,714
and sexually
abused for four days.

1288
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:41,382
{\an8}One of the men
purportedly claimed to be

1289
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,259
{\an8}a law enforcement officer.

1290
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,844
{\an8}It was a cop.

1291
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,305
{\an8}[Reporter]: He
was a police officer?

1292
01:02:47,388 --> 01:02:48,681
Showed me his badge.

1293
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,392
[Sharpton]: My position
on the Brawley case,

1294
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,852
which was always distorted,

1295
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:58,483
was that this is a young
lady who made an accusation.

1296
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,526
{\an8}So she deserved a day in court.

1297
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,944
{\an8}And we promise this family

1298
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:04,238
{\an8}that we'll fight until
hell freezes over.

1299
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:07,658
{\an8}to get a special prosecutor
to go into the courtroom

1300
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,577
{\an8}and bring justice
to Tawana Brawley.

1301
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,079
{\an8}The case is plain. We
need a special prosecutor.

1302
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:15,082
{\an8}And that the attorney general is

1303
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:17,293
{\an8}is the appropriate
person to appoint.

1304
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:22,673
{\an8}Tawana, I know you have gone
through a traumatic experience.

1305
01:03:22,757 --> 01:03:25,718
{\an8}I and my colleagues
are here to help you.

1306
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,303
{\an8}[Sharpton]: The had
the state attorney general

1307
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:31,808
{\an8}become the prosecutor,
who I felt was playing politics.

1308
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:33,017
And at the same time,

1309
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:35,770
he announced he
was going to investigate

1310
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:37,730
the funds of National
Youth Movement.

1311
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,106
So I knew that playbook.

1312
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,818
Like they went at
Dr. King's charity.

1313
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,737
Mr. Abrams says he has leads.

1314
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,072
He's made no arrest.

1315
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:48,574
He's acting as if
only Tawana Brawley

1316
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,910
can give him the evidence
he needs for an arrest.

1317
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,870
{\an8}[Reporter]: The family
refuses to cooperate,

1318
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:56,165
{\an8}saying the authorities are
only interested in a cover-up.

1319
01:03:56,249 --> 01:04:00,586
{\an8}I will not give in to requests
for a new prosecutor

1320
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,129
{\an8}because somebody's
unhappy with Abrams.

1321
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,757
He's the best, as far as I'm
concerned, and that's that.

1322
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,469
You can scream, shout,
protest, lay on the railroad tracks,

1323
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,887
{\an8}it won't make any difference.

1324
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:11,472
{\an8}The story and the controversy
surrounding Tawana Brawley

1325
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:12,890
{\an8}gets more and more curious.

1326
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,601
{\an8}There was a television
report last night that she's lying.

1327
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,853
{\an8}[Sharpton]: It's
easy to play back,

1328
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,271
oh, Brawley was this or that,

1329
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,940
but nobody ever stops
to say, well, first of all,

1330
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:24,735
if two prominent
attorneys told the story,

1331
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:25,903
mother backed it up,

1332
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:28,489
and the guy prosecuting the case

1333
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:30,157
is a guy that also
is after Sharpton,

1334
01:04:30,241 --> 01:04:34,704
why wouldn't Sharpton
believe her and not believe him?

1335
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,330
Oh, I got it.

1336
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,374
All young Black girls lie.

1337
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:39,500
Just make it up.

1338
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:40,960
Tawana Brawley's
kidnapping and rape case

1339
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:42,962
has been mysterious
from the start.

1340
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,590
Just like Michael
Griffith and them.

1341
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,799
They said they was lying.

1342
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,175
Television station
reported witnesses

1343
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,511
had placed the Black
teenager at a party

1344
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,013
{\an8}and accompanied
reputed drug dealers

1345
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,890
{\an8}at the time she said
she was kidnapped.

1346
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:58,019
{\an8}There has been a
continuing journalistic rape

1347
01:04:58,102 --> 01:05:00,897
{\an8}of Tawana Brawley by
the establishment media.

1348
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:02,106
{\an8}The Brawley case
has been marked by

1349
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,566
{\an8}one strange twist after another.

1350
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,610
{\an8}The continuing theatrics
often overshadowed

1351
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:06,903
{\an8}the alleged crime itself.

1352
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,070
{\an8}[Reporter]: Sharpton dropped

1353
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,739
{\an8}another questionable bombshell.

1354
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,240
{\an8}The Reverend Al Sharpton charged

1355
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,243
{\an8}that a group linked to the Irish
Republican Army is involved.

1356
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:16,245
{\an8}It's almost as if the
lawyers themselves

1357
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,624
{\an8}are saying the facts in this
case don't matter that much,

1358
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,709
{\an8}because the general
proposition is true,

1359
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:24,086
{\an8}that there's
institutionalized racism

1360
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,671
{\an8}in the criminal justice system.

1361
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,340
{\an8}Every time we seem to be
getting closer to the answers

1362
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,551
{\an8}in the Tawana Brawley case,
there are a lot more questions.

1363
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,261
{\an8}The question of
did I believe Brawley

1364
01:05:32,345 --> 01:05:34,221
{\an8}is like asking me do I
believe Michael Griffith

1365
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,933
{\an8}was breaking in the house
that night in Howard Beach.

1366
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,769
{\an8}I didn't go do an investigation
on either one of them.

1367
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:42,647
{\an8}There's enough
prima facie evidence

1368
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:44,565
{\an8}to go to court on this.

1369
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,317
{\an8}And that-- guess what? --

1370
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,612
{\an8}is what all cases
in this country go by.

1371
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,781
{\an8}Why is it different for us?

1372
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:54,617
{\an8}My daughter was attacked
by some white officials.

1373
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,119
{\an8}I have named them.
She has named them.

1374
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,914
{\an8}Why don't you get your
people there to pick them up?

1375
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:02,416
{\an8}[Mario Cuomo]: Tawana
Brawley I see as my daughter.

1376
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,544
{\an8}We want a chance to prove
that she will be protected.

1377
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,046
{\an8}And we will all be protected

1378
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,798
{\an8}in the protecting
of Tawana Brawley.

1379
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:11,968
{\an8}To do that, she has
to cooperate with us.

1380
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:15,346
{\an8}The Brawley case was
sandwiched between Howard Beach

1381
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,597
{\an8}and Central Park 5,

1382
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,140
{\an8}and we were
fighting all of them.

1383
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:21,102
{\an8}More than 30 boys in New
York City went wilding last week,

1384
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:23,104
{\an8}and now eight
of them are in jail,

1385
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:24,480
{\an8}charged with several attacks,

1386
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:27,358
{\an8}including an especially
brutal one on a young woman.

1387
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:32,947
{\an8}[Sharpton]: No victim identified
the five boys at Central Park.

1388
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:35,992
{\an8}And Brawley, she
made identification.

1389
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:38,953
{\an8}We are not going
to let this girl

1390
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:42,039
{\an8}be the scapegoat
of a corrupt system!

1391
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,916
{\an8}Mason and Maddox
have obligations

1392
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,793
{\an8}as officers of the court,

1393
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:49,839
{\an8}as well as attorneys
to Tawana Brawley.

1394
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,298
{\an8}They have an
obligation to the system.

1395
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:54,010
{\an8}They are representing
their own interests.

1396
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:57,179
{\an8}They obviously have
a political agenda.

1397
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,683
{\an8}If he serves a subpoena
on Tawana Brawley

1398
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:02,518
or any member of her family,

1399
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,270
we are prepared to be present

1400
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,272
to block the serving
of that subpoena.

1401
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,858
They will not appear
in front of a grand jury.

1402
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:11,777
And we're prepared
to do what is necessary,

1403
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,029
including going to jail.

1404
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,781
As we did with the
original subpoena,

1405
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:20,077
I ask that Bob Abrams,
that he take his subpoenas,

1406
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:21,579
he can do what he wants.

1407
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:23,622
They will have
to arrest us first.

1408
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:27,084
We had just won a
victory in Howard Beach.

1409
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:30,629
Had we met at a phone
booth at 125th Street and said,

1410
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:33,174
"Let's go upstate
and create a hoax."

1411
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:34,842
I mean, why would we do that?

1412
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,344
That doesn't even make sense!

1413
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:40,723
The only reason we
would do it is we believed.

1414
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:43,434
[indistinct chatter]

1415
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:47,063
You don't want to hear
what Tawana has to say!

1416
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:49,482
{\an8}You wanna get this behind you

1417
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:52,943
{\an8}so you can go on with
racist business as usual.

1418
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,821
{\an8}You've got enough
behind you now.

1419
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,699
{\an8}You done got too
much behind you now.

1420
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:02,203
{\an8}And our cups are
filled to the brim.

1421
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:05,915
Racism has run
over in this state.

1422
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:11,796
We will not allow any more
of our blood in New York State

1423
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:13,214
to go unresponded to.

1424
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,424
{\an8}We're tired of burying folks.

1425
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,719
{\an8}We're tired of mothers
who we can't explain

1426
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:21,263
{\an8}why this is happening to them.

1427
01:08:21,346 --> 01:08:23,974
{\an8}And you sit up there
and bring a subpoena

1428
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:26,810
{\an8}on the mother of
a raped daughter.

1429
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,437
And you expect
for us to sit around

1430
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,856
and talk about how
we're gonna comply?

1431
01:08:30,939 --> 01:08:32,024
[Man]: Right on.

1432
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,734
We cannot honor something
that is dishonorable.

1433
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,444
That's where we stand today.

1434
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,488
We're not entertaining
any questions.

1435
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:39,198
Thank you.

1436
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,326
[camera shutters click]

1437
01:08:51,210 --> 01:08:52,752
- [Sharpton]: No justice!
- [Audience]: No Peace!

1438
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,131
- No justice!
- [Audience]: No peace!

1439
01:08:55,214 --> 01:09:00,219
Why is Glenda so
important to us this week?

1440
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:05,099
Look at the history of
the State of New York.

1441
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:09,395
No white man has
ever been convicted

1442
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,523
of raping a Black woman
in the history of the state.

1443
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,358
They keep talking
every night on the news,

1444
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:17,027
[imitates news anchor]
"It's been six months!"

1445
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:18,571
"They're still angry!"

1446
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,531
[laughing and applause]

1447
01:09:20,613 --> 01:09:21,448
"Can you believe it?"

1448
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:24,076
"The negroes are
still with Tawana."

1449
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:28,831
They will say that we are
exasperating racial tensions.

1450
01:09:28,913 --> 01:09:31,417
But the people know the truth.

1451
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,961
The people know
that we've taken more

1452
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,837
than we should've ever taken.

1453
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,966
We should've stopped
you with Michael Stewart.

1454
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,844
We should've stopped
you with Eleanor Bumpurs.

1455
01:09:41,926 --> 01:09:44,220
We should've stopped
you with Randy Evans.

1456
01:09:44,305 --> 01:09:47,057
We should've stopped
you with Michael Griffith.

1457
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:51,020
And we're gonna stop
you with Tawana Brawley!

1458
01:09:51,103 --> 01:09:53,354
"Sorry, Reverend, are
you talking violence?"

1459
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,317
I'm talking what is necessary.

1460
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:00,237
When it was necessary,
God got violent.

1461
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,949
Say that God got mad one day
and drowned the whole world.

1462
01:10:04,074 --> 01:10:06,327
Yeah, y'all say we're crazy?

1463
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:09,163
You've driven us crazy!

1464
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,247
[applause]

1465
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,917
400 years of abuse.

1466
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,919
Let me tell you
something, Mario.

1467
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,004
We are not scared of you.

1468
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,757
You think 'cause you're
Italian and know some boys

1469
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,008
somebody's scared of you?

1470
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:24,053
We are the
descendants of Hannibal

1471
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,846
that walked all over Italy!

1472
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:31,435
[enthusiastic
cheers and applause]

1473
01:10:34,355 --> 01:10:36,523
You will pay from now on

1474
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:40,527
for everything you
do to our people.

1475
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:45,324
If we've got to take justice
in our hands, we will do that.

1476
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:51,830
The Bible said there's a time
for everything under the sun.

1477
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,709
Time to be born
and a time to die.

1478
01:10:55,793 --> 01:11:00,256
A time to plant and a time
to pluck up what is planted.

1479
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:04,051
Time of war and a time of peace.

1480
01:11:04,176 --> 01:11:07,680
It's going to be
a day in history

1481
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:12,351
if you missed the Selma
to Montgomery march,

1482
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,272
if you missed the
March on Washington,

1483
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:20,859
if you missed Marcus
Garvey organizing an army

1484
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,737
coming down 125th Street,

1485
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,322
don't miss Monday.

1486
01:11:25,406 --> 01:11:29,785
[cheers and applause]

1487
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,787
[Sharpton]: There's many moments

1488
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:33,038
that people would come in

1489
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:36,208
and have righteous anger
and want to fight back.

1490
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,462
And we had to develop
ways that we would put our

1491
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:44,133
security teams out there and
marshals to keep people cool.

1492
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:47,303
I don't care if you're
left wing, right wing,

1493
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,554
dropped both wings.

1494
01:11:48,637 --> 01:11:51,849
Whoever you are, you're
gonna listen to security.

1495
01:11:51,932 --> 01:11:55,311
There's many times I got angry
and would want to rhetorically--

1496
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:58,272
I've never been violent,
but I'd get in exchanges.

1497
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:02,151
And you had to learn how
to fine tune it as you went.

1498
01:12:02,234 --> 01:12:04,611
If you cannot listen
to security, don't go.

1499
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:07,448
If you go and get out
there and start cutting up,

1500
01:12:07,531 --> 01:12:09,074
we're gonna take
you behind in the bus

1501
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,617
and break both your legs.

1502
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:15,414
You've gotta be able
to raise the theater level

1503
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,876
to where you don't lose
control, you don't have violence.

1504
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:24,340
But it is dramatic enough that
you can't be ignored, either.

1505
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:28,052
[contemplative music]

1506
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:52,951
[low chatter]

1507
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:07,716
This is one of those moments

1508
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,678
that transcends the
category of the ordinary.

1509
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:13,180
[laughing]

1510
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:15,015
You know there
are two great words

1511
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,435
in the Greek language for time.

1512
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:23,732
And one of things I like about
the Greek language is that it

1513
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:28,320
has a greater capacity
for lifting up nuances

1514
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,781
and shades of meaning.

1515
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:33,450
Two great words in the
Greek language for time,

1516
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:37,788
one is "kairos," and
the other is "chronos."

1517
01:13:37,871 --> 01:13:40,874
Now, you're probably
familiar with "chronos."

1518
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:44,378
That's the word...

1519
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:48,966
That's the root word
for "chronometer."

1520
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:52,511
Chronos has to
do with clock time.

1521
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:54,388
Right now, according to chronos,

1522
01:13:54,471 --> 01:13:56,849
it is 4 o'clock
in the afternoon.

1523
01:13:56,932 --> 01:13:57,975
[laughing]

1524
01:13:58,058 --> 01:14:03,105
But there's another kind of time
that is referred to in the Greek

1525
01:14:03,188 --> 01:14:08,402
by the word kairos,
and that's God time.

1526
01:14:08,485 --> 01:14:12,781
[somber music]

1527
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:29,173
[Jones]: And every now and then,

1528
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:33,010
God time breaks
in on clock time.

1529
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:37,264
- [Man]: Say his name!
- [Crowd]: George Floyd!

1530
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:41,852
[Jones]: The infinite
intersects the finite.

1531
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:57,576
And you get caught up in
the transcendent experience.

1532
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,669
[camera shutters clicking]

1533
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,881
[Sharpton]: This young lady,
if she had not shot that video,

1534
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:14,718
the world would've never
know what happened to George.

1535
01:15:14,801 --> 01:15:19,056
And I want her mother to
know we gonna look out for her.

1536
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:21,183
We'll talk about
that in private.

1537
01:15:21,558 --> 01:15:24,686
My daughter was--she
was on her way to a bonfire,

1538
01:15:24,770 --> 01:15:26,313
like in the opposite direction.

1539
01:15:26,396 --> 01:15:29,274
And she saw what was
happening, it wasn't right.

1540
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,985
So she pulled out her phone.

1541
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:35,739
[somber music]

1542
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:46,625
[camera shutters clicking]

1543
01:16:06,687 --> 01:16:12,401
I want us to not sit here

1544
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:16,363
and act like we had

1545
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:19,157
a funeral on the schedule.

1546
01:16:19,658 --> 01:16:21,034
[Woman]: That's
right, that's right.

1547
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,911
[Man]: Right.

1548
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:28,584
George Floyd should not be

1549
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,043
among the deceased.

1550
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,588
[mourners affirming]

1551
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:38,802
[Sharpton]: He did not die
of common health conditions.

1552
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:45,475
He died of a common American
criminal justice malfunction.

1553
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,769
[mourners affirming, clapping]

1554
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,813
[Sharpton]: One of
the things, Martin,

1555
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:53,025
that I've always
had to deal with,

1556
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,276
as critics would say,

1557
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:57,863
"All Al Sharpton
wants is publicity."

1558
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,449
Well, that's
exactly what I want.

1559
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,160
'Cause nobody calls
me to keep a secret.

1560
01:17:03,243 --> 01:17:07,205
[applause]

1561
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:12,169
People call me to blow up issues

1562
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:14,046
that nobody else
would deal with,

1563
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:18,508
'cause I'm the blow up man,
and I don't apologize for that.

1564
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:22,220
[applause]

1565
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,224
[Sharpton]: George Floyd's story

1566
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:28,894
has been the
story of Black folks,

1567
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:34,274
because ever
since 401 years ago,

1568
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,735
the reason we could never be

1569
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,821
who we wanted and
dreamed of being

1570
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,407
is you kept your
knee on our neck.

1571
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:46,411
[cheers and applause]

1572
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:55,796
[Sharpton]: What happened
to Floyd happens every day

1573
01:17:55,879 --> 01:18:00,550
in this country in
education, in health services,

1574
01:18:00,634 --> 01:18:04,012
and in every area
of American life.

1575
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:08,642
It's time for us to stand
up in George's name

1576
01:18:08,725 --> 01:18:12,270
and say, get your
knee off our necks!

1577
01:18:12,354 --> 01:18:14,356
[cheers and applause]

1578
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,400
[Sharpton]: We
don't want no favors!

1579
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:18,485
Just get up off of us!

1580
01:18:18,568 --> 01:18:22,781
And we can be and
do whatever we can be.

1581
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:27,244
[enthusiastic
cheers and applause]

1582
01:18:29,246 --> 01:18:33,291
[string music]

1583
01:18:40,966 --> 01:18:44,010
[Sharpton]: As a minister, I
have to look at the providence

1584
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:46,638
of in the middle of
a nation lockdown,

1585
01:18:46,722 --> 01:18:49,641
George Floyd happens,
Breonna Taylor happens,

1586
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:50,851
Ahmaud Arbery happens,

1587
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,019
all within the
same span of time.

1588
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,980
And all while everybody
was locked down

1589
01:18:55,063 --> 01:19:00,277
and had to watch the news
over and over and over again.

1590
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:04,573
And it's our job to come out
this other side of this pandemic

1591
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,867
different than when we went in.

1592
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:10,954
But I'm more hopeful
today than ever.

1593
01:19:11,037 --> 01:19:12,581
Why? Well, let me go back.

1594
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:15,625
Reverend Jackson always
taught me, stay on your text.

1595
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:18,587
Go back to my
text, Ecclesiastes.

1596
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:22,674
There is a time and a season.

1597
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:25,010
And when I looked this time

1598
01:19:25,093 --> 01:19:29,139
and saw marches
where in some cases,

1599
01:19:29,222 --> 01:19:33,643
young whites outnumbered
the Blacks marching,

1600
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:38,690
I know that it's a different
time and a different season.

1601
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:42,194
When I looked and
saw people in Germany

1602
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:44,029
marching for George Floyd,

1603
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:47,699
it's a different time
and a different season.

1604
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,995
When they went in front of the
parliament in London, England,

1605
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:56,708
and said it's a different
time and a different season,

1606
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,085
we need to go back to Washington

1607
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:03,924
and stand up in the shadows
of Lincoln and tell them,

1608
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:08,637
this is the time of
dealing with accountability

1609
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,097
in the criminal justice system.

1610
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:13,517
[applause]

1611
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:18,688
[Woman]: I'd like to ask
Reverend Al Sharpton,

1612
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,191
what is the purpose
of a family advisor

1613
01:20:21,274 --> 01:20:22,567
compared to a lawyer?

1614
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:26,321
The lawyer is handling
the legal part of the case.

1615
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:29,950
I am advising them as a minister
and as a community activist,

1616
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,952
as we feel that has
racial overtones--

1617
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:33,995
[Bey]: But it's not
your community, is it?

1618
01:20:34,079 --> 01:20:35,872
Well, what is my community?

1619
01:20:35,956 --> 01:20:37,207
[Bey]: You tell me.

1620
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:38,542
Martin Luther King
marched all over the country.

1621
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,835
Wasn't his community.

1622
01:20:39,918 --> 01:20:41,127
I mean, I mean, what
kind of question is that?

1623
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,671
[Bey]: Well, is
that what you are?

1624
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:43,922
You're now a
national Black leader?

1625
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,131
Is that what you are?

1626
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,758
[Sharpton]: No, I
am a family advisor.

1627
01:20:46,842 --> 01:20:48,593
I mean, which question
do you want me to answer?

1628
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,763
I am an activist fighting
injustice where I find it.

1629
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:55,016
[Bey]: You're Superman.
You go all over the world or--

1630
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,853
[Sharpton]: I've seen other
people on your show, Richard,

1631
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,938
like, uh... that
have been active,

1632
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,064
and they weren't asked that.

1633
01:21:01,147 --> 01:21:02,941
I mean, no one asks Curtis Sliwa

1634
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:04,818
why does he have
Guardian Angels everywhere

1635
01:21:04,901 --> 01:21:06,319
when he lives in one community?

1636
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:07,654
I mean, that's ridiculous!

1637
01:21:07,737 --> 01:21:08,864
[Bey]: But there's
some people that think

1638
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,115
that you'll just look at a case

1639
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:11,867
that you think might
be controversial,

1640
01:21:11,950 --> 01:21:13,618
you'll look at a case that
might be able to get headlines.

1641
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,995
You might be able to make
something out of a case

1642
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:16,288
to make a name for yourself.

1643
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,915
We were all involved in
the Howard Beach case.

1644
01:21:18,999 --> 01:21:22,878
And Reverend Sharpton--
I did not know this.

1645
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:26,298
Ms. Griffith told me this
about November of '77.

1646
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:30,093
This was some nearly 11 months
after her son had been killed.

1647
01:21:30,176 --> 01:21:35,265
She indicated to me that
there was one man who had,

1648
01:21:35,348 --> 01:21:40,186
on a daily basis, called
her, or come to see her,

1649
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:42,606
or asked her if she
needed something.

1650
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,774
And this didn't ever
get in the headlines.

1651
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,235
This person never called
any press conferences

1652
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,697
when he made those
contacts with that family.

1653
01:21:50,780 --> 01:21:52,699
That person was
Reverend Al Sharpton.

1654
01:21:52,782 --> 01:21:55,243
The reality of it is, is
that there's a lot of things

1655
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:58,580
that Reverend Sharpton
do for a lot of victims

1656
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:01,458
that people never knew about.

1657
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,043
He counseled
the Griffith family.

1658
01:22:03,126 --> 01:22:04,502
He counseled other victims.

1659
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:08,673
And he's doing a great job with
respect to the Brawley family.

1660
01:22:08,924 --> 01:22:12,594
[indistinct chatter]

1661
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:27,692
[scattered chanting]

1662
01:22:31,655 --> 01:22:33,823
Back up, back up.

1663
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,201
- [Man]: What do we need?
- [Crowd]: A Black army!

1664
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:41,748
- [Man]: What do we need?
- [Crowd]: A Black army!

1665
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:45,877
[Sharpton]: Ms. Brawley
will not attend this hearing

1666
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,630
unless the members
of the community

1667
01:22:48,713 --> 01:22:50,548
are allowed to go in with her.

1668
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,175
[Man]: Right, right.

1669
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:55,136
[Sharpton]: We have the
right to a public hearing.

1670
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,682
We will not allow Glenda
to be disenfranchised.

1671
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:03,019
We have come prepared
to give our show cause.

1672
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:04,771
We will do it at
a public hearing.

1673
01:23:04,854 --> 01:23:07,565
We will not do it
in a private setting.

1674
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:08,858
So we will stand here.

1675
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,485
If the lawyers cannot
open the courtroom,

1676
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:15,281
we will be leaving and
holding this court in contempt.

1677
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:18,201
You sure you don't want
to bring your client up here?

1678
01:23:18,284 --> 01:23:20,370
Judge, my client already
knew the outcome of this.

1679
01:23:20,453 --> 01:23:24,833
She had no confidence
in the judicial system here.

1680
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:27,627
Black people in this
state have no confidence.

1681
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,546
[Judge]: Is that their defense?

1682
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:30,964
--to the judiciary.

1683
01:23:31,047 --> 01:23:32,465
[Judge]: Let me
ask you, Mr. Maddox.

1684
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,760
And I'm pretty sure Mr. Abrams
will ask for his 30 days.

1685
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:38,680
That's the maximum
allowed by law--

1686
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:39,973
[Judge]: Mister--Mr. Maddox.

1687
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:41,307
--right now, we can all leave.

1688
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:44,519
[Judge]: Mr. Maddox,
is it your defense--

1689
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:45,645
[Maddox]: I have no defense.

1690
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,105
Is it the defense in this case

1691
01:23:47,188 --> 01:23:50,025
that Black people
cannot receive justice?

1692
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:52,402
[Maddox]: Yes.

1693
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:55,071
That's your defense
to this motion to--

1694
01:23:55,155 --> 01:23:56,781
[Maddox]: Yes, absolutely.

1695
01:23:56,865 --> 01:24:00,785
Do you wish to be heard?

1696
01:24:01,953 --> 01:24:03,830
[Mason]: He agrees with us.

1697
01:24:03,913 --> 01:24:05,165
[Maddox]: He agrees with it.

1698
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,208
- [Judge]: Pardon me?
- [Maddox]: He agrees with it.

1699
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:08,877
[Judge]: Agrees
with that statement?

1700
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,964
- I doubt that.
- [Maddox]: I'm hoping he does.

1701
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,382
[Judge]: Who made the statement?

1702
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:16,342
Mr. Ryan, do you
agree that Black people

1703
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:18,845
can't receive
justice in this state?

1704
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,472
No, I do not.

1705
01:24:20,722 --> 01:24:22,640
[Judge]: The moving
papers before me

1706
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,434
have raised no factual issue.

1707
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:28,438
All that the defense has raised
have been political in nature,

1708
01:24:28,521 --> 01:24:32,859
and might very well be raised
in another form and not here.

1709
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:35,820
Glenda Brawley's in
criminal contempt of this court

1710
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,156
and is sentenced and
committed to the county jail

1711
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,659
for a period of 30 days.

1712
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:46,956
We will be seeking
religious asylum for her.

1713
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:50,877
We challenge Bob Abrams
to come into the church

1714
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,420
and do what he's got to do.

1715
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:57,300
We're going to force you to show
the world how beastly you are.

1716
01:24:57,884 --> 01:25:00,470
- Hi, Bob.
- Hi, hi, hi.

1717
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:03,765
The advisors of Ms. Brawley
have apparently set up

1718
01:25:03,848 --> 01:25:06,518
a staged circumstance today,

1719
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:10,814
and I've advised the
sheriff not to bite at their bait.

1720
01:25:10,897 --> 01:25:13,399
A media circus has been staged.

1721
01:25:13,483 --> 01:25:18,655
[shouting]

1722
01:25:20,031 --> 01:25:22,325
No justice, no peace!

1723
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:24,452
- When do we want it?
- [Crowd]: Now!

1724
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:26,287
- What do you want?
- [Crowd]: Justice!

1725
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:27,956
- When do you want it?
- [Crowd]: Now!

1726
01:25:28,039 --> 01:25:29,916
- When do you want it?
- [Crowd]: Now!

1727
01:25:29,999 --> 01:25:31,000
[applause]

1728
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:32,293
[Man]: WLIB Radio
in New York City.

1729
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:34,170
It's Monday, June 27, 1988.

1730
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,339
Good morning and
greetings to the WLIB family.

1731
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:39,801
Anyone that understands
the history of our people

1732
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:42,971
understand that any
time you start shaking

1733
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:45,890
the root of this system,
then you're gonna have

1734
01:25:45,974 --> 01:25:49,018
a discredit campaign.
And what we've seen is that.

1735
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,271
This is the largest crowd

1736
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:53,815
that we have ever
had at Bethany.

1737
01:25:53,898 --> 01:25:55,775
Give yourselves applause.

1738
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:57,277
[applause]

1739
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:59,904
[Maddox]: Every time
that there's a report,

1740
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,282
it attracts a large
white audience.

1741
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:04,367
It's like seeing a
lynching, you know?

1742
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:07,662
"I'm getting ready to see
these Black men lynched.

1743
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:10,748
This is something I want
to do. I have a thirst for this."

1744
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:15,712
And TV is
satisfying that thirst.

1745
01:26:18,089 --> 01:26:20,508
Wait, wait, wait.

1746
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:26,472
Everybody that is on this list

1747
01:26:26,556 --> 01:26:30,226
has signed in from
a news media station

1748
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,145
that thinks that
they can attack us

1749
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:35,815
and we cannot answer them
by name have walked out.

1750
01:26:35,899 --> 01:26:37,108
I'll turn this over to the army.

1751
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:38,359
They will never be allowed

1752
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,904
in a press conference
or rally of ours.

1753
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:42,280
[cheers and applause]

1754
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,325
The very strident, militant,
confrontational policy

1755
01:26:45,408 --> 01:26:48,953
that you've taken in terms of
dealing with the justice system,

1756
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,497
uh, and the fact that
there has been, what?

1757
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:54,542
At least four incidents
of racist violence

1758
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:57,295
in this town over the
last four or five days

1759
01:26:57,378 --> 01:26:58,546
are somehow linked.

1760
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:02,342
There are people
in this town, of color,

1761
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:05,595
who are more concerned
about white feelings

1762
01:27:05,678 --> 01:27:09,015
than they are about
Black lives, you see?

1763
01:27:09,098 --> 01:27:14,145
And so they should be
happy that all we're doing

1764
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:17,398
is to insist and demand justice.

1765
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:20,026
[Maddox]: The one thing that
the white man has always done

1766
01:27:20,109 --> 01:27:22,987
and the one thing that
he will never change,

1767
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:27,116
he will always give you a signal

1768
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:32,121
as to who he fears and
who you should follow.

1769
01:27:32,705 --> 01:27:37,961
But there are some of us
who watch out for his signals.

1770
01:27:38,044 --> 01:27:40,380
We ignore what he says,

1771
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:44,634
because the Native American
told us many years ago

1772
01:27:44,717 --> 01:27:48,221
that the white man speaks
with a forked tongue.

1773
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:52,350
[applause]

1774
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:56,145
If we did not have
radio station WLIB--

1775
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:57,897
- [DJ]: That's right.
- Where would we go?

1776
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,233
People are gonna say, "Well,
you're talking about separatism."

1777
01:28:00,316 --> 01:28:03,695
I don't care what
they call it, see?

1778
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:05,113
White folks are crazy.

1779
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:10,660
We know what the white man
did with the Native American.

1780
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:17,625
Now the white man is calling
himself the native American.

1781
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:24,549
White people will rewrite
history in your face.

1782
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,426
[applause]

1783
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,761
[Sharpton]: We're tired of this!

1784
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,305
Enough is enough!

1785
01:28:30,388 --> 01:28:32,390
Payback has come!

1786
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:34,851
You now have the nerve,

1787
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:36,352
after all we did for you,

1788
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:40,356
to put your wicked
hands on our daughter!

1789
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,860
You will pay for Tawana Brawley!

1790
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:46,738
You will pay for Tawana Brawley!

1791
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:49,407
[cheers and applause]

1792
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:54,662
[somber music]

1793
01:29:01,627 --> 01:29:05,423
[Sharpton]: Later in life, I
became more conscious.

1794
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:10,470
I saw Tawana, in many ways,

1795
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:11,763
like the Black mother I had

1796
01:29:11,846 --> 01:29:17,143
that was fighting for
her kids, or my sister.

1797
01:29:17,226 --> 01:29:24,567
I saw in her a Black woman
Black men wouldn't stand up for.

1798
01:29:24,650 --> 01:29:29,405
And I wasn't gonna be the
one to walk away from her,

1799
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:31,491
no matter how hard it got.

1800
01:29:31,574 --> 01:29:34,118
I just wasn't gonna do it.

1801
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:35,787
Okay, that's close enough.

1802
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:36,913
That's close enough.

1803
01:29:36,996 --> 01:29:38,456
I didn't tell you
all to do that.

1804
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:43,044
[cheers and applause]

1805
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,089
- No justice!
- [Crowd]: No peace!

1806
01:29:46,172 --> 01:29:47,965
- No justice!
- [Crowd]: No peace!

1807
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:50,802
- No justice!
- [Crowd]: No peace!

1808
01:29:51,552 --> 01:29:53,721
[cheers and applause]

1809
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:58,017
[Sharpton]: To this day, I
don't know all of what happened

1810
01:29:58,101 --> 01:29:59,519
with Brawley.

1811
01:29:59,685 --> 01:30:02,230
But I know she
deserved the right

1812
01:30:02,313 --> 01:30:04,107
that everybody else deserved.

1813
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:05,441
[Tawana Brawley]: My
name is Tawana Brawley.

1814
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:08,403
I'm not a liar,
and I'm not crazy.

1815
01:30:08,486 --> 01:30:10,154
I simply just want justice,

1816
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,198
and then I want
to be left alone.

1817
01:30:12,281 --> 01:30:15,535
My family and I saw that
we couldn't get any justice.

1818
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:18,371
So we decided not to cooperate.

1819
01:30:18,454 --> 01:30:21,082
We had no New
York Times to leak to.

1820
01:30:21,165 --> 01:30:22,417
[media chatter]

1821
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,044
[Reporter]: Tawana, why
won't you answer any questions?

1822
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:26,337
[Reporter]: Reverend Sharpton?

1823
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:28,548
After seven months
of investigation,

1824
01:30:28,631 --> 01:30:31,968
the grand jury found no evidence

1825
01:30:32,051 --> 01:30:34,554
that a crime had been committed

1826
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,139
against Tawana Brawley.

1827
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:37,557
[Reporter]: Governor,
do you have a reaction

1828
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,268
to the Brawley
grand jury report?

1829
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:43,020
It's not a perfect system,
but it's better than any system

1830
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,480
anywhere in the world.

1831
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:47,817
Reverend Sharpton was part
of the group of three advisors

1832
01:30:47,900 --> 01:30:50,778
and the same kinds of
adjectives apply to him.

1833
01:30:50,862 --> 01:30:54,907
Abominable behavior, deplorable,
disgraceful, reprehensible.

1834
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,993
[Reporter]: The attorney
general says that not only you,

1835
01:30:57,076 --> 01:30:58,995
but Mr. Mason and Mr. Maddox,

1836
01:30:59,078 --> 01:31:00,204
are under investigation.

1837
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:02,415
What do you think is
going to come out of that?

1838
01:31:02,498 --> 01:31:03,749
Hardy-ha-ha.

1839
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:06,377
[Reporter]: What do you
think is going to come out of it?

1840
01:31:06,461 --> 01:31:07,628
Nothing.

1841
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:10,423
{\an8}I'm saddened and angry
that we've come to this point,

1842
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:13,384
{\an8}where people would
use a young woman,

1843
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,637
{\an8}or use anyone in our
community for their own ambition.

1844
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:20,850
{\an8}They have made it less likely
that the victims of racial bias

1845
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:24,437
{\an8}in the criminal justice system
will be heard in the future.

1846
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,689
{\an8}They have disserved their cause.

1847
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,150
[Sharpton]: I remember I
was on a show one night.

1848
01:31:29,233 --> 01:31:31,152
And a guy said to
me, "You done well.

1849
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:32,487
You're doing all right now.

1850
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:35,990
But I still disagree
with you on Brawley."

1851
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:37,450
I said, "What do
you disagree with?

1852
01:31:37,533 --> 01:31:39,076
That they should've
gone to court?"

1853
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:40,411
"Well, I think she lied.

1854
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:44,248
And I think the jury was right."

1855
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:47,460
I said, "Let me ask
you a question."

1856
01:31:47,543 --> 01:31:48,669
He said, "Yeah?"

1857
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:51,214
I said, "Do you think
OJ killed his wife?"

1858
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:52,507
He said, "Absolutely."

1859
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:54,592
I said, "Well, the
jury said he didn't."

1860
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:59,180
So I got it. You
can question juries.

1861
01:31:59,263 --> 01:32:03,559
I should just be a
nice boy and shut up.

1862
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:10,566
[indistinct chatter]

1863
01:32:18,157 --> 01:32:20,451
[Bailiff]: AR2 is
back in session.

1864
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:24,247
[Maddox]: In 1988,
we are being told

1865
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:27,416
that every person
of African descent

1866
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:29,877
cannot participate in
First Amendment rights.

1867
01:32:29,961 --> 01:32:34,298
And the responsibility that
you have at this moment is

1868
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:39,303
to dismiss each and every
one of allegations set forth

1869
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:40,888
in those complaints.

1870
01:32:40,972 --> 01:32:43,391
In the event that they
are not dismissed,

1871
01:32:43,474 --> 01:32:48,521
I have 1,000 people who are
ready to go to jail right now.

1872
01:32:48,604 --> 01:32:50,398
What you are talking about
is putting something down

1873
01:32:50,481 --> 01:32:53,901
for a week from now, when
people have already been harmed

1874
01:32:53,985 --> 01:32:56,487
as a result of this.
You can't undo that.

1875
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,656
You are sanctioning.

1876
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:01,701
By allowing this to go
on for one further minute,

1877
01:33:01,784 --> 01:33:06,163
you are sanctioning the
misconduct in this order.

1878
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:09,834
[applause]

1879
01:33:39,947 --> 01:33:41,282
[Maddox]: Well, there are people

1880
01:33:41,365 --> 01:33:42,700
who are prepared
to go to jail now.

1881
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:44,702
Revoke this-- no, no, no.

1882
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:46,662
Your Honor, before you do that--

1883
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:48,372
[Maddox]: Yeah, right now.

1884
01:33:48,456 --> 01:33:49,457
[Lawyer]: Your Honor.

1885
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:50,458
Your Honor.

1886
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:55,338
[courtroom spectators shouting]

1887
01:34:09,435 --> 01:34:12,730
[Sharpton]: We marched
peacefully through

1888
01:34:12,813 --> 01:34:15,650
these downtown streets.

1889
01:34:15,733 --> 01:34:18,152
We didn't break a window glass.

1890
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:19,111
[Woman]: Not one.

1891
01:34:19,195 --> 01:34:20,821
We didn't touch a pane.

1892
01:34:20,905 --> 01:34:23,324
We didn't close a business.

1893
01:34:23,407 --> 01:34:25,451
We didn't touch a pedestrian.

1894
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,495
We didn't snatch a pocketbook.

1895
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:29,413
We didn't damage any property.

1896
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,416
[shouts and applause]

1897
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:36,212
Now they're telling us that
they can delay and adjourn

1898
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:40,758
and pick the date that they
will decide on our freedom.

1899
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:43,469
I'm sorry, Officer Gallagher.

1900
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:46,722
But you can't choose
the day no more.

1901
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:48,724
We've had all we can take.

1902
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:52,186
You think you're God,
and you're not God!

1903
01:34:52,311 --> 01:34:53,354
[shouts and applause]

1904
01:34:53,437 --> 01:34:55,064
I'm telling you,
we're not leaving.

1905
01:34:55,147 --> 01:34:59,318
We'll spend this night
in jail or in this room.

1906
01:34:59,402 --> 01:35:01,946
I'm telling you that
you drew the line!

1907
01:35:02,029 --> 01:35:05,741
It don't mean nothing!
Take God's name off the wall!

1908
01:35:05,825 --> 01:35:08,452
[cheers and applause]

1909
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:13,499
[Sharpton]: Jews-- Jews
ran through the precinct

1910
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:15,668
and you didn't lock up nobody.

1911
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:18,462
Italians marched, you
don't lock up nobody.

1912
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:21,799
And you're gonna tell
us, the children of slaves

1913
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,759
that built your nasty streets,

1914
01:35:23,843 --> 01:35:25,886
that cleaned your nasty behinds,

1915
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,930
that we can't walk the streets,

1916
01:35:28,013 --> 01:35:31,100
we'll turn this
town upside down!

1917
01:35:31,183 --> 01:35:32,977
[cheers and applause]

All of them jumped on me
and started knocking me around.

{\an8}Most of them on that list
never made high media.

1939
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:41,313
But they say I only do
it for media attention.

1940
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,233
And most of them that we
got a lot of media attention

1941
01:37:44,316 --> 01:37:47,319
didn't get media attention
before we came in,

1942
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:49,822
and certainly we prolonged it.

1943
01:37:49,905 --> 01:37:52,575
I do this 'cause it's what I do.

1944
01:37:57,538 --> 01:37:59,707
The week of our march leading in

1945
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:02,376
is the week of the
Republican convention.

1946
01:38:02,459 --> 01:38:05,880
So it's gonna be the major
event going into the fall.

1947
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:10,426
{\an8}Marches and protesting is
always about timing in history.

{\an8}You got to know the right time.

1949
01:38:12,636 --> 01:38:15,431
{\an8}Here the challenge
comes for the movement.

{\an8}Say Biden wins.

1951
01:38:17,808 --> 01:38:20,144
{\an8}Does everybody calm down, then?

1952
01:38:20,227 --> 01:38:23,647
And you gotta make
it above politics.

1953
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:28,986
Trump losing does not
assure justice is present.

1954
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:31,322
It is less of an impediment,

1955
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:34,450
but you still gotta put
pressure on the system.

do Facetime, right?

What do you think of that?

1972
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:19,203
Are you the opening act?
Are you the comedian tonight?

1973
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:21,872
[Sharpton]: Mother

1974
01:39:21,956 --> 01:39:24,708
{\an8}Good to be seen, babe.

1975

{\an8}Thank you.

1976

when y'all need me.

move yourself physically to the left

1978

01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:37,304
[News anchor]: So of course,

1980
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:39,306
to the bad old days
on this Juneteenth

Rev, I wanna start with you.

1984
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,149
What do you make of
that kind of language

1985
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:53,487
coming out of the president of
the United States on Juneteenth?

1986
01:39:53,570 --> 01:39:56,115
I think that it is offensive.

1987
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:58,367
I think that it is insulting.

1988
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:00,494
[phone ringing]

1989
01:40:01,036 --> 01:40:05,040
Yeah, Mike, Chris did a

1990
01:40:05,124 --> 01:40:06,583
Yeah, I'm sorry--
I walked through

with two of the police officers.

1992
01:40:08,877 --> 01:40:10,504
And it's a very open field.

1993
01:40:10,587 --> 01:40:15,718
There's not a lot of cover--
well you can see everybody.

1994
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:17,011
So it's kind of open.

1995
01:40:17,094 --> 01:40:20,723
{\an8}I don't believe--
It's a security risk.

1996

the concern a shooter?

{\an8}[Hardy]: Do you have a
recommendation, Chris?

1999
01:40:31,191 --> 01:40:34,445
Honestly... Rev shouldn't...

2000
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:36,447
really shouldn't do this.

2001
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,950
I don't believe it's
feasible with the climate,

2002
01:40:40,034 --> 01:40:42,411
with the reports
that we're getting

2003
01:40:42,494 --> 01:40:43,746
even from the officers of

2004

the amount of people
that are out there.

2005
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:49,376
I mean, I think, Hardy,
the best thing you can do

2006
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,879
is let them secure
as much as they can.

2007
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:54,548
I'm going to do it.
I don't, you know...

2008

We get threats all the time.

01:41:38,592 --> 01:41:40,969
Hawkins was shot
dead after a confrontation

2029
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:44,431
with a gang of whites in an
Italian-American neighborhood.

2030
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:48,352
The peace seems to be getting
harder and harder to keep.

2031
01:41:48,435 --> 01:41:50,646
[shouting]

2032
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:56,068
{\an8}[Man]: Hey, we want
Al Sharpton out here!

2033
01:41:56,151 --> 01:41:58,362
{\an8}White power!

2034
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,198
{\an8}Kill 'em mother
fucker, we kill 'em!

2035
01:42:01,323 --> 01:42:02,866
{\an8}This is all the media's fault!

2036
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,160
{\an8}The media should not
publicize this kind of crap

2037
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:08,038
because they're all wanting
wars to start in another place.

2038
01:42:08,122 --> 01:42:10,499
These things
should be kept quiet.

2039
01:42:10,582 --> 01:42:12,167
Al Sharpton, go home!

2040
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:14,670
[Cameraman]: New tape, new tape.

2041
01:42:14,753 --> 01:42:15,963
Tape man.

2042
01:42:16,046 --> 01:42:16,964
[tape static]

2043
01:42:17,047 --> 01:42:18,132
[Man]: Where's Al Sharpton?

2044
01:42:18,215 --> 01:42:19,967
[Man]: Bullshit and lies!

2045
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:22,553
[shouting]

2046
01:42:28,267 --> 01:42:31,186
[Woman]: Get an ambulance!

2047
01:42:32,688 --> 01:42:37,067
[Sharpton]: Until you
face what could be the end,

2048
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:41,905
you guess what you would do
if you looked death in the face.

2049
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:45,159
But it's different when you
think you're looking death

2050
01:42:45,242 --> 01:42:47,703
in the face, and
death is saying to you,

2051
01:42:47,786 --> 01:42:49,621
"Now what you gonna do?"

2052
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,290
[Female anchor]: The
controversial activist

2053
01:42:51,373 --> 01:42:52,875
Al Sharpton is in
the hospital tonight

2054
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:54,501
with a stab wound to the chest.

2055
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,378
Police say a white man
from the Bensonhurst area

2056
01:42:56,461 --> 01:42:59,047
{\an8}attacked Sharpton as he
prepared to lead a march

2057
01:42:59,131 --> 01:43:00,382
{\an8}in that community.

2058
01:43:00,465 --> 01:43:02,217
{\an8}They rushed him here
to Coney Island Hospital,

2059
01:43:02,301 --> 01:43:05,304
{\an8}where doctors treated him
for a wound in the upper chest,

2060
01:43:05,387 --> 01:43:07,014
{\an8}just below the collarbone.

2061
01:43:07,097 --> 01:43:09,349
The weapon? A
5-inch kitchen knife.

2062
01:43:09,433 --> 01:43:12,019
[Sharpton]: It changed
me in two ways.

2063
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:14,021
One way, it made me know

2064
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:17,316
that I really was not gonna
stop no matter what they did.

2065
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:19,067
[Reporter]: How do
you feel about the attack

2066
01:43:19,151 --> 01:43:21,403
and the guy who came out of
the crowd and attacked you?

2067
01:43:21,486 --> 01:43:25,699
Well, I think that he
is the personification

2068
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:26,909
of a lot of hate,

2069
01:43:26,992 --> 01:43:29,328
and I don't have ill
feelings toward him.

2070
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:32,122
I would much rather
concentrate on the justice system.

2071
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:36,335
[Sharpton]: Second thing,
if I am going to die for this,

2072
01:43:36,418 --> 01:43:39,129
I want to change to society.

2073
01:43:39,213 --> 01:43:41,173
That means you've
got to change laws.

2074
01:43:41,256 --> 01:43:45,177
[Reporter]: Mr. Mason
and Mr. Maddox,

2075
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:48,972
there seems to be
some divisiveness.

2076
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,307
Are you calling for calm?

2077
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:52,517
Are you supporting
the march today?

2078
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:55,437
Oh, I'm absolutely
calling for calm.

2079
01:43:55,520 --> 01:44:00,525
Maddox was always more in
the nationalist, Malcolm tradition.

2080
01:44:00,609 --> 01:44:04,655
[applause]

2081
01:44:04,863 --> 01:44:06,114
[Sharpton]: They
made a decision,

2082
01:44:06,198 --> 01:44:07,950
them three or four days
I was in the hospital,

2083
01:44:08,033 --> 01:44:09,493
that they were not
gonna let whites

2084
01:44:09,576 --> 01:44:14,248
attend the rallies
anymore like Slave Theater.

2085
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:16,041
That's when I left.

2086
01:44:16,124 --> 01:44:18,502
Maddox understood I
was going another way.

2087
01:44:18,585 --> 01:44:24,341
We just saw our roles and
our traditions differently.

2088
01:44:26,051 --> 01:44:28,262
Vernon Mason went
to Harlem went me

2089
01:44:28,345 --> 01:44:31,473
and helped me start
National Action Network,

2090
01:44:31,556 --> 01:44:33,141
{\an8}an organization
on the principles

2091
01:44:33,225 --> 01:44:34,601
{\an8}of Martin Luther King.

2092
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:39,564
{\an8}We must not reduce ourselves
to, "If you don't do it my way",

2093
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,400
{\an8}"you ain't right."

2094
01:44:41,483 --> 01:44:45,028
{\an8}"If you ain't out here
with me, you ain't right."

2095
01:44:45,112 --> 01:44:47,948
Because all of us
don't need to be outside.

2096
01:44:48,031 --> 01:44:51,785
Somebody better be
inside helping us outside,

2097
01:44:51,868 --> 01:44:55,247
or we gonna be outside forever.

2098
01:44:55,330 --> 01:44:57,165
[Sharpton]: Mrs.
Coretta Scott King,

2099
01:44:57,249 --> 01:45:00,544
Martin Luther King's widow,
was the one that challenged me.

2100
01:45:00,627 --> 01:45:04,339
She says, "Al, let me ask you,

2101
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:06,758
why did you say
'so-and-so' in this occasion?"

2102
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:12,389
I will never bow down to one
of these chicken shit negroes

2103
01:45:12,472 --> 01:45:16,059
that y'all have elected
to one of these offices,

2104
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:17,311
that have done nothing

2105
01:45:17,394 --> 01:45:19,771
but kiss crackers'
behinds all their life!

2106
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,523
[applause]

2107
01:45:21,606 --> 01:45:24,609
[Sharpton]: And I'm trying
to explain and justify--

2108
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:26,903
I mean, it was almost
like I'm in a court

2109
01:45:26,987 --> 01:45:28,530
being a defense attorney.

2110
01:45:28,613 --> 01:45:31,366
And I'm half shocked
that Mrs. Coretta Scott King

2111
01:45:31,450 --> 01:45:35,162
knows about all this
stuff I did and said.

2112
01:45:35,245 --> 01:45:37,164
And then she says,

2113
01:45:37,247 --> 01:45:40,167
"Al, you realize that
words have power?"

2114
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,501
So as we rebuild the family,

2115
01:45:41,585 --> 01:45:45,297
know that what you
put in Black children

2116
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:46,631
is what will grow in them.

2117
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:49,217
[Sharpton]: "So you
oughta be careful with that."

2118
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:54,431
She says, "You can
either go for the crown"

2119
01:45:54,514 --> 01:45:58,352
"that we talk about
in Christianity,

2120
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,729
"or you can go for the crowd.

2121
01:46:00,812 --> 01:46:01,938
You gotta choose."

2122
01:46:02,022 --> 01:46:03,398
[Sharpton]: This is your life.

2123
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,192
It's like a blank
piece of paper.

2124
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:07,277
You can write on
it what you want,

2125
01:46:07,361 --> 01:46:09,321
or the world will
write on it for you.

2126
01:46:09,404 --> 01:46:13,408
You should write for yourself
the things that are positive

2127
01:46:13,492 --> 01:46:15,077
and powerful for you.

2128
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:18,497
You don't give people
room to misinterpret,

2129
01:46:18,622 --> 01:46:23,126
because the cause is the
bigger than the applause you get.

2130
01:46:23,251 --> 01:46:24,294
{\an8}The Reverend Al Sharpton says

2131
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:26,254
{\an8}he'll run for the
US Senate seat.

2132
01:46:26,338 --> 01:46:29,216
{\an8}We must be concerned
about the agenda

2133
01:46:29,299 --> 01:46:31,343
{\an8}that empowers our community.

2134
01:46:31,426 --> 01:46:34,429
{\an8}[Sharpton]: And I had to
learn to discipline myself.

2135
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,516
[Reporter]: Amadou Diallo
was shot by four police officers

2136
01:46:37,599 --> 01:46:39,768
who fired 41 shots at him.

2137
01:46:39,851 --> 01:46:42,312
[shouts of "Amadou!"]

2138
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:43,939
[Sharpton]: This is not the end.

2139
01:46:44,022 --> 01:46:45,148
This is the beginning.

2140
01:46:45,232 --> 01:46:46,858
We intend to
nationalize this fight.

2141
01:46:46,942 --> 01:46:52,155
I became more defined as
in the lane that I was born in.

2142
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,074
It was not I had changed.

2143
01:46:54,157 --> 01:46:56,743
I had returned, and
that's who I was.

2144
01:46:56,827 --> 01:47:02,207
We are angry, but we are bright
enough and intelligent enough

2145
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:04,501
to channel our
anger to get results!

2146
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:06,253
[Reporter]: The Reverend
Al Sharpton and others today

2147
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:09,840
found justice not outside
of the system, but through it.

2148
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:11,007
[Woman]: Please welcome

2149
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:12,968
Democratic
presidential candidate

2150
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:14,719
Reverend Al Sharpton!

2151
01:47:14,803 --> 01:47:15,804
[applause]

2152
01:47:15,887 --> 01:47:18,306
[Sharpton]: There's
a difference between

2153
01:47:18,390 --> 01:47:21,143
making news and making history.

2154
01:47:21,226 --> 01:47:23,019
I think you gotta go
beyond your comfort zone.

2155
01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:26,398
A civil rights activist who now
hosts his own program on MSNBC--

2156
01:47:26,481 --> 01:47:29,025
Welcome to PoliticsNation.
I'm Al Sharpton.

2157
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,194
In the '50s, it was Emmitt Till.

2158
01:47:31,278 --> 01:47:34,114
Now it is Trayvon Martin.

2159
01:47:34,197 --> 01:47:37,492
This boy should be alive today!

2160
01:47:37,576 --> 01:47:38,618
The work we've done with

2161
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,537
the Taskforce for
21st Century Policing,

2162
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:42,497
that at times you've
participated in,

2163
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:44,124
terrific recommendations.

2164
01:47:44,207 --> 01:47:45,792
Appreciate you, sir. Thank you.

2165
01:47:45,876 --> 01:47:48,712
{\an8}And Mrs. King was
a large part of that.

2166
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:56,386
{\an8}[Reporter]: Developing now,

2167
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:57,846
{\an8}crowds are gathering
in the nation's capital

2168
01:47:57,929 --> 01:48:00,640
{\an8}for a rally called The
Commitment March--

2169
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:03,185
{\an8}Get Your Knee Off Our Necks.

2170
01:48:03,268 --> 01:48:05,979
It also marks the
57th anniversary

2171
01:48:06,062 --> 01:48:07,397
of the March on Washington,

2172
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:10,025
one of the most important
civil rights demonstrations

2173
01:48:10,108 --> 01:48:12,402
in our nation's history.

2174
01:48:12,486 --> 01:48:15,697
Joining us now, the organizer
of today's march on Washington,

2175
01:48:15,780 --> 01:48:17,657
my dear friend, the
Reverend Al Sharpton.

2176
01:48:17,741 --> 01:48:20,160
He is the President of the
National Action Network.

2177
01:48:20,243 --> 01:48:24,414
He also hosts
MSNBC's PoliticsNation.

2178
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:25,707
I understand the anger,

2179
01:48:25,790 --> 01:48:28,001
but your anger should
be directed in a way

2180
01:48:28,084 --> 01:48:30,754
that you're going to deal
with what you're angry about.

2181
01:48:30,837 --> 01:48:35,425
You cannot let your anger
make you like what you're fighting.

2182
01:48:35,509 --> 01:48:36,676
Nobody's more angry than me.

2183
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:39,221
I've been fighting these
issues for decades.

2184
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:42,307
But am I angry enough
to channel my anger

2185
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:43,808
toward what I'm angry about?

2186
01:48:43,892 --> 01:48:46,937
Or, am I gonna start being
like what I'm angry about,

2187
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:49,189
reckless and violent?

2188
01:48:49,272 --> 01:48:51,691
[indistinct chatter]

2189
01:48:52,359 --> 01:48:54,194
97.6--you are good to go!

2190
01:48:54,277 --> 01:48:55,737
- Thank you.
- Of course.

2191
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:57,364
- How are you doin', boss?
- Good, how are you?

2192
01:48:57,447 --> 01:48:58,782
[Yamiche Alcindor]:
Yesterday was crazy.

2193
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:00,450
I was at that gathering
at the White House,

2194
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:02,494
hoping that none of
those germs will kill us all.

2195
01:49:02,577 --> 01:49:05,497
You see how careful
we're trying to be.

2196
01:49:05,580 --> 01:49:06,748
It's crazy.

2197
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:08,458
{\an8}[Alcindor]: Nobody was
tested. It was just crazy.

2198
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:10,794
{\an8}We tested everybody, and
those that we had to let in

2199
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:12,963
{\an8}we tested in
brackets in the back.

2200
01:49:13,046 --> 01:49:13,713
{\an8}Yeah.

2201
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,298
{\an8}[Sharpton]: Everybody's here?

2202
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:16,925
The busses are in, but
they have to walk over

2203
01:49:17,008 --> 01:49:18,051
from Union Station.

2204
01:49:18,134 --> 01:49:19,344
{\an8}Good to see you. You all right?

2205
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:20,762
{\an8}- They treating you all right?
- Yeah.

2206
01:49:20,845 --> 01:49:24,599
{\an8}If they don't take care
of you, you let me know.

[Man]: Show me what
democracy looks like!

2210
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:38,405
[Group]: This is what
democracy looks like!

2211
01:49:38,530 --> 01:49:42,409
[Sharpton]: You slowly helped
some families to understand

2212
01:49:42,492 --> 01:49:45,287
that it's bigger than them,

2213
01:49:45,370 --> 01:49:49,082
and that their loved one
can be the Emmett Till,

2214
01:49:49,165 --> 01:49:50,584
can be the symbol,

2215
01:49:50,667 --> 01:49:52,502
then we can change
it for other families.

2216
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:54,671
We can't bring 'em
back. I wish we could.

2217
01:49:54,754 --> 01:49:56,047
[Reporter]: Reverend Sharpton,

2218
01:49:56,131 --> 01:49:57,632
What is your call to action?

2219
01:49:57,716 --> 01:50:03,430
We want to push the George
Floyd Policing and Justice bill

2220
01:50:03,513 --> 01:50:04,848
and the John Lewis voting bill.

2221
01:50:04,931 --> 01:50:07,684
They ought to go to
their senators, email them,

2222
01:50:07,767 --> 01:50:09,394
and say those bills must pass.

2223
01:50:09,477 --> 01:50:12,439
But we can make
a historic statement

2224
01:50:12,522 --> 01:50:13,773
if we just work together.

2225
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:17,360
{\an8}Anything you need, let us
know. All right? Anything.

2226
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:20,697
{\an8}I'm gonna give you my
number if you need anything.

2227
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:29,456
{\an8}You have to have somebody
that's been there with them,

2228
01:50:29,539 --> 01:50:31,333
{\an8}they know what to talk about,

2229
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:32,959
{\an8}that's not coming in
with platitudes and all,

2230
01:50:33,043 --> 01:50:36,379
but they're coming
with real-life stuff.

2231
01:50:36,463 --> 01:50:37,380
And I've been there.

2232
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,466

2233
01:50:39,549 --> 01:50:44,679

2236
01:50:50,393 --> 01:50:53,480
{\an8}I always questioned
when I was younger,

01:50:53,563 --> 01:50:55,899
{\an8}why did God let this happen?

[Crowd]: No peace!

2246
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:13,416
[Sharpton]: And I
thought about it later in life,

2247
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,918
that if I hadn't
went through that,

2248
01:51:15,001 --> 01:51:16,878
I probably couldn't have
ministered to those families,

2249
01:51:16,961 --> 01:51:19,547
'cause I would've never
known that experience.

2250
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:25,595
2020, we must deal
with police brutality.

2251
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:28,723
2020, we must deal with those

2252
01:51:28,807 --> 01:51:32,060
that want to rob
our right to vote.

2253
01:51:32,143 --> 01:51:33,561
[applause]

2254
01:51:33,645 --> 01:51:36,564
[Sharpton]: So I know what
a lot of those families I end up

2255
01:51:36,648 --> 01:51:41,027
later in life had to go
through, 'cause I was that kid.

2256
01:51:41,111 --> 01:51:45,490
And I didn't come to
shame 'em or use 'em.

2257
01:51:45,573 --> 01:51:47,409
I came to help 'em

2258
01:51:47,492 --> 01:51:49,494
and help the cause.

2259
01:51:49,577 --> 01:51:53,540
I bring you the brother
of George Floyd,

2260
01:51:53,623 --> 01:51:55,458
Philonise Floyd.

2261
01:51:55,583 --> 01:51:59,587
But you can't ignore their
needs to help the cause.

2262
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:03,258
And I never talk about
it, won't talk about it now.

2263
01:52:03,341 --> 01:52:05,635
That's between
me and the families.

2264
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:07,637
It's part of that vow I made.

2265
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:12,726
[Philonise]: I wish George
were here to see this right now.

George, for Breonna,

in the history of this state

that a white police officer has
been convicted of a murder.

This is the first time
in a long ray of fights

Just two days from now,

we're going to have to
deal with the funeral of

Daunte Wright in this same area.

2301
01:54:31,322 --> 01:54:36,077
Before we do anything,
we first wanna pray.

2302
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:39,831
We believe in a God that can
even get through the cracks

2303
01:54:39,914 --> 01:54:45,378
of the jury room and bring
conscious and bring truth.

2304
01:54:45,461 --> 01:54:47,755
And that jury, we
wanna thank them

2305
01:54:47,839 --> 01:54:50,717
for letting God give
them the strength.

2306
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,261
Wherever they are tonight,
we want them to know

2307
01:54:53,344 --> 01:54:57,682
we broke down in tears
when we heard the verdict.

2308
01:54:57,765 --> 01:55:00,685
We had to hold each
other and hug and tears,

2309
01:55:00,768 --> 01:55:02,937
because too many
nights we've cried,

2310
01:55:03,021 --> 01:55:06,816
many of us for decades,
spent nights in jail.

2311
01:55:06,900 --> 01:55:09,736
But today we can
wipe our tears away

2312
01:55:09,819 --> 01:55:11,529
and fight on for another day.

2313
01:55:11,613 --> 01:55:12,947
There's sunlight.

2314
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:16,284
We're gonna keep going 'til
we bring it for the Eric Gardners

2315
01:55:16,367 --> 01:55:19,454
and the Breonna Taylors,
whose boyfriend is here tonight.

that did not get this night,

2320
01:55:26,461 --> 01:55:27,587
this night is for them.

2321
01:55:27,670 --> 01:55:29,505
Let us pray.

2322
01:55:31,090 --> 01:55:32,300
What about the meeting?

2323
01:55:32,383 --> 01:55:33,927
{\an8}Are you satisfied with
what went on in there?

2324
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:35,511
{\an8}We asked the police
commissioner point blank

2325
01:55:35,595 --> 01:55:38,806
{\an8}to suspend--
emphatically suspend

2326
01:55:38,890 --> 01:55:39,891
{\an8}the officer in question.

2327
01:55:39,974 --> 01:55:43,561
{\an8}And we got a lot of
runaround about that.

2328
01:55:43,645 --> 01:55:45,855
{\an8}[Sharpton]: Dear
God, we thank you

2329
01:55:45,939 --> 01:55:49,108
for giving us the
strength to stand together.

2330
01:55:49,192 --> 01:55:51,903
Sometimes we would
question each other.

2331
01:55:51,986 --> 01:55:55,281
Sometimes we say this is
just gonna be a waste of time.

2332
01:55:55,365 --> 01:55:58,409
A young man was shot and his
murderer has not been punished.

2333
01:55:58,493 --> 01:56:01,245
And, I mean, you can talk
about long range, short range,

2334
01:56:01,329 --> 01:56:03,748
any kind of
investigations you want.

2335
01:56:03,831 --> 01:56:06,542
[Sharpton]: And
Lord, let George know

2336
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:09,420
that his name is
going down in history.

2337
01:56:09,504 --> 01:56:10,922
And we give you the praise.

2338
01:56:11,005 --> 01:56:14,759
Thank you, and God,
we give you the glory.

2339
01:56:14,842 --> 01:56:17,971
These blessings we
ask in your name, amen.

2340
01:56:18,054 --> 01:56:19,681

2341
01:56:19,764 --> 01:56:20,890

[applause]

2343
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:23,768
[Sharpton]: You
have white policemen

2344
01:56:23,851 --> 01:56:25,812
policing the community
that have the same mentality

2345
01:56:25,895 --> 01:56:27,063
that this man has.

2346
01:56:27,146 --> 01:56:28,815
So, I mean, you're
talking about the grand jury

2347
01:56:28,898 --> 01:56:30,692
and an investigation, a
DA, means nothing to us.

2348
01:56:30,775 --> 01:56:32,318
The only thing that
means something to us

2349
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:33,528
is direct action--

2350
01:56:33,611 --> 01:56:37,532
pull the white policeman out
and deal with that situation.

2351
01:56:38,783 --> 01:56:39,909
Reverend Alfred Sharpton,

2352
01:56:39,993 --> 01:56:41,452

Youth Movement.

2353
01:56:41,536 --> 01:56:43,788
{\an8}[Terrence Floyd]: Reverend
Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton,

2354
01:56:43,871 --> 01:56:45,707
{\an8}they lived to see this.

2355
01:56:47,834 --> 01:56:50,086
{\an8}Their fight wasn't in vain.

2356
01:56:50,712 --> 01:56:53,006
{\an8}It just didn't happen
when they did it.

2357
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:54,215
{\an8}But it happened now.

2358
01:56:54,298 --> 01:56:57,093
{\an8}Let's make sure, Reverend
Al, that this moment

2359
01:56:57,176 --> 01:57:02,807
{\an8}will be documented for
our children yet unborn

2360
01:57:03,516 --> 01:57:08,688
{\an8}as they continue on
the journey to justice.

01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:13,943
a policeman convicted
on all three charges.

2363
01:57:14,027 --> 01:57:15,695
Movements need victories.

2364
01:57:15,778 --> 01:57:17,989
The George Floyd
verdict gave us that victory.

2365
01:57:18,072 --> 01:57:19,741
[Female reporter]:
Congratulations. Thank you so much.

2366
01:57:19,824 --> 01:57:22,493
[Sharpton]: When I
started at 18 years old

2367
01:57:22,577 --> 01:57:23,703
as a youth director for

2368
01:57:23,786 --> 01:57:26,205
Shirley Chisolm
for President in '72,

2369
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:30,293
we never dreamed of a Black
woman being vice president.

2370
01:57:31,210 --> 01:57:33,838
When we would boycott and picket

2371
01:57:33,921 --> 01:57:36,466
supermarkets and
stores in my teen years

2372
01:57:36,549 --> 01:57:38,051
in Operation Breadbasket,

2373
01:57:38,134 --> 01:57:42,722
it was not even in
the realm of fantasy

2374
01:57:42,805 --> 01:57:47,143
that we'd see Black CEOs
of Fortune 500 companies.

2375
01:57:47,226 --> 01:57:49,854
Don't tell me
things won't change.

2376
01:57:49,937 --> 01:57:53,357
I kept telling family after
family that we keep going,

2377
01:57:53,441 --> 01:57:56,110
at some point,
we'll break through.

2378
01:57:56,194 --> 01:58:01,074
I sat on the stage when a Black
man named Barack Hussein Obama

2379
01:58:01,157 --> 01:58:05,286
put his hand on Abraham Lincoln
and Martin Luther King's bible

2380
01:58:05,369 --> 01:58:07,622
and was sworn in president
of the United States.

2381
01:58:07,705 --> 01:58:13,419
I've seen too much change
to feel that nothing will change.

2382
01:58:15,838 --> 01:58:18,925
I've seen a lot of
things go backwards,

2383
01:58:19,008 --> 01:58:23,137
but I keep the change in my
head because the change I've seen

2384
01:58:23,221 --> 01:58:28,017
makes me know that if we keep
going, we can break through.

2385
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:33,397
I want to use for a subject,
"No Justice, No Peace."

2386
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:35,316
[applause]

2387
01:58:35,399 --> 01:58:39,278
I want 50, 100 years from
now for somebody to say,

2388
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:44,158
there was a time police
used to get way with brutality.

2389
01:58:44,242 --> 01:58:47,578
There was a time that they
gave a Voting Rights Act,

2390
01:58:47,662 --> 01:58:48,871
and it lasted 50 years,

2391
01:58:48,955 --> 01:58:51,374
and the Supreme Court
took the gut out of it.

2392
01:58:51,457 --> 01:58:54,252
And oh, there was a
little fat guy from Brooklyn

2393
01:58:54,335 --> 01:58:55,795
who dropped out of college.

2394
01:58:55,878 --> 01:58:58,005
When he got older,
he lost the weight.

2395
01:58:58,089 --> 01:59:00,925
He was on the front
line to help in all of that.

2396
01:59:01,008 --> 01:59:02,760
Nobody will care what
kind of apartment I have.

2397
01:59:02,844 --> 01:59:04,929
Nobody will care how
much money I made.

2398
01:59:05,012 --> 01:59:07,181
They'll care that I
was one of them.

2399
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:10,560
Did those two or
three things in history.

2400
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:13,312
That's all. That's all.

2401
01:59:13,396 --> 01:59:17,733
And when I see my mentors
in heaven, I can tell them...

2402
01:59:17,817 --> 01:59:20,194
I got some stuff done.

2403
01:59:21,654 --> 01:59:23,823
[Reporter]: I wonder if
this moment feels different

2404
01:59:23,906 --> 01:59:26,075
on a legislative
and policy front.

2405
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:27,410
[Sharpton]: I do.

2406
01:59:27,493 --> 01:59:30,163
We're dealing with a police
case in Columbus, Ohio.

2407
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:32,540
Dealing with a shooting
in North Carolina.

2408
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:35,293
We're dealing with
the killing here, Daunte.

2409
01:59:35,376 --> 01:59:37,003
If now is not the time,

2410
01:59:37,086 --> 01:59:39,964
I don't know when it
ever will be the time.

2411
01:59:40,047 --> 01:59:42,133
[Reporter]: Reverend Al
Sharpton, thank you so much,

2412
01:59:42,216 --> 01:59:45,011
on a day like today, for
making some time to talk to us.
