1
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:05,598
STICKUP AT 3 O'CLOCK

2
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:02,586
- Martínez... put out the forms.
- Yes, sir.

3
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:08,114
- Good morning, Mr. Director.
- Galindo, what are you doing here?

4
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:12,480
I finally found the 9 cents that were
missing from Mr. Latienne's balance.

5
00:03:12,555 --> 00:03:14,739
Oh! You made the most of the night.

6
00:03:15,064 --> 00:03:18,492
Let's get back to work then!
Cheerfully, with no remorse.

7
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:23,901
- Hand me the overtime report.
- Thank you. - With 140%.

8
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:27,512
I'm sorry, Mr. Director, but
according to the rules that's not right.

9
00:03:27,632 --> 00:03:32,086
The employee lost the 9 cents and stayed
to look for them as is his obligation.

10
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:34,535
- Yeah, but...
- Did you order him to stay?

11
00:03:34,655 --> 00:03:37,360
I did not.
I prefer employees to sleep.

12
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:42,493
Then you don't have the right to get paid,
you did it on your own.

13
00:03:42,568 --> 00:03:46,736
Don Prudencio,
you're on top of everything.

14
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:55,981
Martínez!
A black coffee and an aspirin.

15
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:00,784
- You know he won the lottery?
- Who?

16
00:04:06,086 --> 00:04:08,386
And they don't want revolutions!

17
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:12,644
- Have you ever bet on the 113?
- No dear, I haven't.

18
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,428
That could only occur
to Don Prudencio.

19
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:20,385
- Maybe he's cheating.
- No, he's just a charmed man.

20
00:04:20,538 --> 00:04:23,146
- With that face?
- I mean he's lucky.

21
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:26,114
As long as luck is not equally shared
there will be no social justice.

22
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:28,505
Enough, let's get to work!

23
00:04:28,806 --> 00:04:32,556
Work is the only lottery
we workers have.

24
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:40,686
- Good morning, Mr. Galindo.
- Good morning, Miss Vicenta.

25
00:04:40,806 --> 00:04:44,806
- You woke up early today.
- And I haven't slept a wink...

26
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,288
With 60.000 pesetas at home.
Exposed to thieves.

27
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:53,979
Because there are too many, sir!

28
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:58,180
How calm I am now leaving it here.

29
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:02,880
- 60.000, right? -Yes.
- Sign here, please.

30
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,720
60.000.

31
00:05:06,884 --> 00:05:09,447
- How's the farm business?
- Can't complain...

32
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,283
Getting new customers each day.

33
00:05:11,358 --> 00:05:14,936
And losing cows, but as long
as they continue making swamps...

34
00:05:15,253 --> 00:05:20,271
You devil!
Mr. Galindo, you're always in a good mood.

35
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:22,786
The mood that the client deserves.

36
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:29,583
Watch out, vandal!

37
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,011
Holy cow!

38
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:32,936
Good morning, Mr. GM.

39
00:05:39,127 --> 00:05:41,564
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

40
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,584
Good morning, Mr. GM.

41
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,493
What a pleasant surprise, Mr. GM!
How's Mr. GM doing?

42
00:05:47,593 --> 00:05:49,536
- You look fine today.
- I'm doing very fine.

43
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:52,110
And your august mother?
Your beautiful and distinguished wife?

44
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:56,397
- They are all excellent.
- I always keep them in my prayers.

45
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,816
Allow me.

46
00:05:59,049 --> 00:06:01,379
- Signature, Don Felipe.
- What are you doing, Enriqueta?

47
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:03,768
- Signature for the head office.
- OK, but...

48
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:07,671
- The GM.
- The GM? He can wait!

49
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:12,389
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. GM.

50
00:06:12,612 --> 00:06:15,050
- Please, have a seat. Cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

51
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:18,188
Smoking is a very silly,
unhealthy and dangerous habit.

52
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:21,986
Yes, sir.
What nonsense.

53
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:26,222
- If Mr. GM doesn't need me...
- Stay here, Delgado.

54
00:06:28,966 --> 00:06:31,036
- How come he's here?
- It's obvious.

55
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:34,063
To tell Don Felipe
to give us extra pay.

56
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:38,954
Yeah... Such a grim face
can't bring good news.

57
00:06:40,474 --> 00:06:44,684
He's maybe in a good mood
and thought about doing us a favor.

58
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:49,014
He got a duodenal ulcer, Benítez.

59
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:52,895
And every time he's in pain,
he loves to be a pain in the ass!

60
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:58,254
In the last semester you have granted
unsecured loans worth 9 million pesetas,

61
00:06:58,329 --> 00:07:00,205
and who are the beneficiaries?

62
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,575
- Give me the list, Redondo.
- I'll explain, Mr. GM.

63
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:08,175
There's no need. You have given
that money that is not yours, to...

64
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:15,374
to a pianola seller,
a truss manufacturer...

65
00:07:16,355 --> 00:07:19,850
a civil servant who wants to put up
a tiger nut milk stand...

66
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,614
They're all good people.
They will return the money.

67
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:26,313
What if they don't?
Will you replace it?

68
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,924
I think it's time for you
to take some days off.

69
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:35,312
One year, or maybe two.
With half of your salary, of course.

70
00:07:35,432 --> 00:07:39,187
You need to take care of yourself.
Miss, give me the balances of these gentlemen.

71
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:41,267
I feel great.

72
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:44,386
I didn't even get a cold this winter.

73
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:47,096
I was counting
on my whole salary, thought...

74
00:07:47,197 --> 00:07:48,960
Health comes first.

75
00:07:49,267 --> 00:07:55,170
And during your absence, Mr. Delgado
will take over as director of this bank.

76
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:02,655
- I want to cash a check!
- Yeah, yeah...

77
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,937
Will they give us any extra pay?

78
00:08:05,141 --> 00:08:07,947
A pay rise?
A change of hours?

79
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,596
A catastrophe.

80
00:08:09,829 --> 00:08:13,481
I want to cash a check!
175 pesetas.

81
00:08:13,556 --> 00:08:15,501
Wait a minute,
don't you see we're busy?

82
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,820
- What's wrong?
- Tell us.

83
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:21,827
They kicked out Don Felipe.
A two year vacation.

84
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,602
- Sorry, I'm in a hurry...
- Shut up!

85
00:08:23,717 --> 00:08:27,169
- You should've come earlier.
- I told you, the duodenum.

86
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,021
- So many young people dying every day...
- And this man alive and kicking!

87
00:08:32,096 --> 00:08:34,665
If only he'd had a stroke last month!

88
00:08:35,112 --> 00:08:38,569
- Miss, the balances.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,486
Seems like this is the new director.

90
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:46,034
- The balances, miss!
- Yes, sir.

91
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,758
It was an honor, Mr. GM.

92
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,845
I'm at your distinguished wife's feet...

93
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,360
and my respectful greetings
to your sons and daughters.

94
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,088
Take good care, Mr. GM.

95
00:08:58,208 --> 00:08:59,916
- The balances!
- No need!

96
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,806
- Take good care.
- Have a nice day.

97
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:06,418
Mr. GM said "have a nice day".

98
00:09:06,538 --> 00:09:09,176
Have a nice day, Mr. GM!

99
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,107
Always at your service, Mr. GM.

100
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,886
Have a nice day.

101
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,786
What's this?
What's wrong with you?

102
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,668
Get to work!

103
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:25,569
There's too much slacking
in this office,

104
00:09:25,644 --> 00:09:28,844
but soon everyone
will be under my thumb.

105
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:32,398
- And you, what do you want?
- Nothing...

106
00:09:32,518 --> 00:09:34,486
I'll come back some other day.

107
00:10:06,808 --> 00:10:09,138
It's 4 o'clock.
Didn't you hear?

108
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,936
I'm writing down some reports.

109
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:24,649
- Castrillo, it's 4 o'clock.
- I know...

110
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,366
But I have to work on some balances.

111
00:10:28,186 --> 00:10:30,707
Do you also have work to do?

112
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:35,527
- No, but three cents are missing.
- Money is always missing with you, Galindo.

113
00:10:47,196 --> 00:10:50,119
I'm sweeping a little bit.

114
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,286
Apparently today
everyone wants to work.

115
00:10:53,658 --> 00:10:58,086
That's great,
but don't expect any overtime pay.

116
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:11,736
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Don Prudencio.

117
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:52,128
We know the injustice
that has been done to you.

118
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:56,403
If they fire you
they will have to fire us all!

119
00:11:56,478 --> 00:12:00,804
- We'll take the same days off as you!
- This your thanks for 40 years service.

120
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,740
Kicking you out when you're old.
What a disgrace!

121
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,827
Don't worry, you can count on us!

122
00:12:05,947 --> 00:12:08,293
- We don't like Don Prudencio!
- The GM neither!

123
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:10,186
Neither the Board!

124
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:12,526
And if necessary we'll declare
a sit-down strike!

125
00:12:12,646 --> 00:12:14,653
That's right,
sitting all day doing nothing,

126
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:17,934
- joking around!
- Easy boys, easy.

127
00:12:18,924 --> 00:12:24,021
Deep down they are right,
I'm old, I'm worthless.

128
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:27,762
You have always been very good to us.

129
00:12:27,837 --> 00:12:30,216
- Never denied an advance.
- Not even a day off.

130
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:34,361
Anytime we were late
he always fell for our story.

131
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:36,408
You'll make me cry.

132
00:12:36,628 --> 00:12:40,720
Now I realize that we have been
a united family.

133
00:12:40,924 --> 00:12:47,378
I'm happy to know that if I lose my job,
I gain six friends and...

134
00:12:47,724 --> 00:12:50,759
Are you having a laugh?

135
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,374
I'm not, Mr. Director,
I'm glad you got fired.

136
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:58,686
Galindo!
I thought you were a good friend.

137
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:02,500
- I'm glad because I am a good friend.
- Where is your moral sense, Galindo?

138
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,611
Maybe he wants a promotion.

139
00:13:04,686 --> 00:13:07,041
- He's a scab!
- A pig!

140
00:13:07,116 --> 00:13:09,986
No disrespect, janitor!
There are still classes.

141
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:13,021
I said I'm glad and I'm glad.

142
00:13:13,245 --> 00:13:16,856
I'm tired of getting up at 7,
of working like a slave,

143
00:13:17,116 --> 00:13:20,986
of having millions in my hands
without giving me time to savor them.

144
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,936
- I'm tired of being poor!
- Come again?!

145
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:27,554
I want to spend the summer
on the CÃ´te d'Azur...

146
00:13:27,654 --> 00:13:31,707
and spend the winter in Chamonix hanging
out with the female slalom champion!

147
00:13:31,782 --> 00:13:36,886
I was born to live like a duke and
you have stopped me from doing so.

148
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:39,805
- Me?
- Yes. Galindo, son...

149
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:41,759
Are you all right?

150
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:44,759
- He got meningitis!
- Call the shrinks!

151
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:47,202
I'm using my common sense.

152
00:13:47,322 --> 00:13:50,566
Don Felipe being here
nothing could be done.

153
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:54,371
But Don Prudencio is another thing...

154
00:13:54,686 --> 00:13:57,138
- It can be done!
- What?

155
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:01,144
- Sticking-up this bank.
- Wow!

156
00:14:01,264 --> 00:14:03,566
Silly me, you know what I understood?

157
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:07,173
- "To stick-up this bank".
- That's what I said.

158
00:14:08,555 --> 00:14:11,986
It seems a little strange,
but it's easier than that.

159
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:14,546
I have everything scientifically studied.

160
00:14:14,666 --> 00:14:17,614
Even with plans,
all I have to do is write them out.

161
00:14:17,818 --> 00:14:21,186
And I can guarantee you
that nobody will find out.

162
00:14:21,306 --> 00:14:25,329
You are not a madman,
you are a scoundrel.

163
00:14:25,636 --> 00:14:29,526
You've got me wrong.
I don't plan to take everything.

164
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:32,333
I want to share.

165
00:14:32,408 --> 00:14:34,265
Enough! Say no more!

166
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,798
All right. We have time to think about it
until Don Prudencio takes charge.

167
00:14:38,918 --> 00:14:41,963
- Galindo! You'll have to explain yourself!
- Yes sir...

168
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:47,391
I will keep you informed.
You'll find me at home for any questions.

169
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:54,245
If you come at night, don't arrive in groups,
the watchman is very distrustful.

170
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,555
Go with him! Put some ice on him,
give him some pills...

171
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:03,066
- Something's got to be done!
- Poor Mr. Galindo, he's nuts.

172
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,163
Who would've thought?
A man so honest and serious.

173
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:13,059
- Suggesting that barbarity...
- Well, "barbarity"...

174
00:15:13,142 --> 00:15:17,566
Let's be empathic.
We didn't hear a thing.

175
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:22,714
Galindo has always been a role model.
Tomorrow he won't even remember.

176
00:15:23,196 --> 00:15:26,740
- Blank check?
- As Mr. Marquis wishes.

177
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,186
This is what I want.
Everything is automatic.

178
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,512
- I was born for this. Open it.
- They'll kick us out.

179
00:15:37,587 --> 00:15:39,687
Don't be a fool.
Open it.

180
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,386
Get in.

181
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:48,518
- We'll get it dirty, Mr. Galindo.
- You're so meek.

182
00:15:48,593 --> 00:15:50,893
- The Minister saw us.
- What Minister? -That gentleman.

183
00:15:50,978 --> 00:15:54,450
He's the manager.
This button is for the music.

184
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,699
No, it's this one.
Well, no.

185
00:15:57,819 --> 00:16:00,091
This is the real round steering wheel ???
for German dough.

186
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:03,120
- German dough, the real thing!
- The Minister!

187
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,916
He's not a Minister.

188
00:16:07,436 --> 00:16:10,052
- What are you looking for, sir?
- A Mercedes.

189
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:12,772
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

190
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,164
What color is trendy?

191
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:18,175
We have the ambassador lacquer black,
the Robespierre red...

192
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:21,359
- and the navy blue.
- What do you think?

193
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,868
I'd prefer a hard-wearing color.

194
00:16:24,102 --> 00:16:27,703
That would be the cannon grey.

195
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:30,881
That would be nice.
Do you have a catalog?

196
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:34,323
- The special or the ordinary one?
- Special.

197
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:37,447
What currency
do you prefer to be paid in?

198
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,709
- We have no prejudices here.
- Good.

199
00:16:40,998 --> 00:16:45,164
A great life is ahead of us, Martínez.
Having anything you want.

200
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:48,304
Champagne, caviar...

201
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:51,879
- This...
- I'm married waiting for another kid!

202
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:53,936
Who cares?
We'll be rich, Martínez.

203
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:57,622
- No rules when you're rich.
- The catalogs.

204
00:16:57,742 --> 00:16:59,780
Another for you.

205
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:04,815
We'll get to visit the whole world...
the exotic Caribbean sea,

206
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:07,335
Hawaii, Capri, the Swiss lakes...

207
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,106
- I don't think the Minister likes us.
- Where do you want to go?

208
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:13,853
I'd want to visit LogroÃ±o...

209
00:17:13,973 --> 00:17:16,413
- my dad was from there.
- That's a short ride in a Mercedes.

210
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:19,236
Mine or yours?

211
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,635
- Bye.
- See you tomorrow.

212
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,153
- I saw you!
- What a fright!

213
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,130
I saw you getting out of that car
with a man.

214
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,756
That's my boss, since I left work
so late he offered to give me a ride.

215
00:17:49,831 --> 00:17:51,752
Bye, Lolita.

216
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:55,906
Last time I saw you getting out of
another car and you told the same story!

217
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,795
He owns three or four cars.

218
00:17:57,965 --> 00:18:00,566
His nickname is "Vehicle fleet".

219
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:03,062
What?!

220
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:08,820
- Lolita, you cheat on me.
- You're the one who cheats on me.

221
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:11,305
You've been promising me
a wedding for 5 years now...

222
00:18:11,425 --> 00:18:13,412
- and nothing.
- Now I'm serious!

223
00:18:13,532 --> 00:18:16,033
We're getting married next month!
And from now on I'll be the only one...

224
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:20,446
- who gives you a ride.
- Are you gonna rob the Bank of Spain?

225
00:18:20,521 --> 00:18:23,047
- Maybe.
- Then you could buy me lots of things.

226
00:18:23,122 --> 00:18:24,822
I'll buy you th-th...

227
00:18:38,938 --> 00:18:42,078
- Hit him with the vase!
- Shut up, kid!

228
00:18:50,686 --> 00:18:52,820
You missed half the plot.

229
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:56,163
- Who is the killer?
- I think it's the one with the mustache.

230
00:18:56,283 --> 00:18:59,121
Three pesetas. Won't you give me
a discount for him?

231
00:18:59,196 --> 00:19:02,966
- He and his wheelchair take up
a lot of space - Yes, but he's quiet.

232
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:07,462
Come on... Business is doing great,
I saw you last night...

233
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:09,237
Some foreigners.

234
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,162
Since the show has already started,
only 5 pesetas each.

235
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:22,697
- Finally I find you home.
- I was leaving.

236
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,561
Here you are,
two installments for the TV.

237
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:27,930
- I don't have any change.
- Don Rogelio told me...

238
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,850
if you don't pay
I have to take the TV with me.

239
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:33,463
Would you be able to take it away and
leave this house without distraction?

240
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:40,186
Poor Don JosÃ© is paralysed, his only exercise
is getting up and down in the wheelchair.

241
00:19:40,286 --> 00:19:44,640
And you know Lupita,
as long she's here, she's not sinning.

242
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,566
Don Rogelio told me
TV is a luxury item.

243
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,451
If you can't afford it,
grin and bear it.

244
00:19:49,526 --> 00:19:52,946
They killed the one with the mustache!

245
00:19:53,021 --> 00:19:56,227
Keep an eye on the lame guy,
I don't trust him.

246
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:59,383
- He looks like a killer! Come in.
- Don Rogelio told me...

247
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:02,286
The rubber is here.
Don't miss it!

248
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:06,583
- Don't worry, I'll pay you.
- When? Otherwise I'll take the TV away.

249
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,144
Soon, maybe in a few days.

250
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:12,600
<i>Tomorrow's Planners
Share capital 200 million</i>

251
00:20:16,056 --> 00:20:18,454
What a day.
I lost 150 pesetas...

252
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:21,386
That idiot of Moreno
didn't want to lend me 200 pesetas.

253
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:26,451
And now here they don't want me
to buy on credit. Unbelievable!

254
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:29,629
- You're living large.
- I'm a gentleman.

255
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:31,608
I'm free, baby...

256
00:20:31,683 --> 00:20:35,483
I don't have the money,
but some day I will. And then...

257
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:39,065
- Then, remember you owe me 100 pesetas.
- Don't worry.

258
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,586
<i>Stick-Up of the Century</i>

259
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:52,071
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- No, I never think.

260
00:20:52,171 --> 00:20:55,064
- If that Galindo's idea were possible...
- It's crazy.

261
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:58,786
He seemed very confident
and said they'd never find out.

262
00:20:59,064 --> 00:21:02,225
- They eventually do.
- Some don't.

263
00:21:02,345 --> 00:21:04,112
Come on and get two tickets.

264
00:21:04,232 --> 00:21:08,375
- You owe me 100 pesetas already...
- Shut up and let this honey pass.

265
00:21:08,656 --> 00:21:11,055
I'm free, baby.

266
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:12,906
I'm not surprised.

267
00:21:13,006 --> 00:21:16,086
- I'm pretty good at this, see?
- I see.

268
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:45,566
- There.
- And why are we stopping here?

269
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,860
To fool him, you idiot.

270
00:21:52,987 --> 00:21:55,229
- Where's the watchman?
- Sleeping, for sure.

271
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:58,006
And Galindo too.
We'll wake him up...

272
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:01,202
- and he'll have a bad scare!
- Didn't he tell us to come and ask him?

273
00:22:01,277 --> 00:22:06,237
I don't want to ask him anything.
I'm just keeping you company!

274
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:09,566
- Well, here we are.
- This is a crazy idea!

275
00:22:09,686 --> 00:22:12,566
You just watched the movie,
they bust them all!

276
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:15,103
Because they looked like robbers!

277
00:22:15,223 --> 00:22:17,686
Do we look like robbers?

278
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:21,964
- Come in.
- Me?

279
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:24,236
Go ahead, don't be afraid.

280
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:35,386
Doggie! Ca-calm!

281
00:22:35,506 --> 00:22:38,064
We're... we're just friends.

282
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:41,326
Good doggie, go inside.

283
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,837
- Go.
- Stop, Rinti.

284
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:46,656
Come on, Rinti.

285
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:49,213
We keep him to scare away thieves.

286
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:52,186
- This is a deserted area.
- Sure.

287
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:55,176
My brother is waiting for you.
Stop, Rinti.

288
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,773
Come in.

289
00:23:14,686 --> 00:23:16,986
- You watch.
- And I thought we were going to be...

290
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:20,498
the first to get here.
They almost put us out of business.

291
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:23,381
- This place is livened up!
- I knew you'd come.

292
00:23:23,501 --> 00:23:26,123
- He came, I didn't.
- Then what are you doing here?

293
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:29,412
Sit down.
We were sharing out the spoils.

294
00:23:29,487 --> 00:23:31,387
- Already?
- Sure.

295
00:23:31,486 --> 00:23:34,168
Before the stick-up,
we have to know what everyone needs.

296
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:37,423
That's how you do the accounts,
and then it adds up.

297
00:23:37,686 --> 00:23:39,608
- Have you thought it over?
- Absolutely.

298
00:23:39,728 --> 00:23:41,686
Are you sure they'll never find out?

299
00:23:41,806 --> 00:23:44,113
- Sure.
- And nothing's going to happen to us?

300
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:47,000
- What could happen to us?
- Do you agree?

301
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:48,611
- Sure.
- Certainly!

302
00:23:48,686 --> 00:23:51,055
- It's a done deal!
- Count me in then.

303
00:23:51,226 --> 00:23:53,841
Go on, boss.
We're talking about Enriqueta's TV.

304
00:23:53,961 --> 00:23:56,386
Get off, janitor.
Let me do my job.

305
00:23:57,236 --> 00:24:00,822
So, six installments for the TV.
Anything else?

306
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:03,636
- A mid-season coat.
- For me?

307
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,386
Six pairs of socks.

308
00:24:07,773 --> 00:24:11,569
And a hearing aid for the doorkeeper.
The poor thing doesn't hear anything.

309
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:17,534
Good. Total: 13.600.
Let's say 15.000.

310
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,860
To round off.
What do you want?

311
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,123
This is so unexpected...

312
00:24:23,243 --> 00:24:25,783
Four or five suits and a coat.

313
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:28,536
Suede shoes, and shirts...

314
00:24:28,686 --> 00:24:31,886
and a crocodile wallet
with 1.000 pesetas inside.

315
00:24:32,394 --> 00:24:33,882
Good.

316
00:24:33,957 --> 00:24:36,669
- Next.
- It's your turn, sir.

317
00:24:36,744 --> 00:24:38,860
- I don't want anything.
- Some trinket!

318
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,886
Nothing. I'm going home.

319
00:24:41,006 --> 00:24:42,706
You've gone crazy.
I can't believe it!

320
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:46,093
Mr. Castrillo,
this a business like any other.

321
00:24:46,326 --> 00:24:49,060
A business?
This is a robbery like no other!

322
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,783
We are incapable of robbing anyone,
but a bank is not anyone.

323
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:56,325
- Who loses money from a bank robbery?
- Clients don't!

324
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:59,586
Shareholders will deduct it
from undeclared profits.

325
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:01,847
And they will add it
to the declared losses.

326
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,909
- They'll charge it to the insurance.
- And they won't pay it to the Tax Office!

327
00:25:05,029 --> 00:25:09,536
- They'll even make a profit.
- Understood?

328
00:25:10,346 --> 00:25:11,611
Well.

329
00:25:11,686 --> 00:25:14,216
In that case, I want a villa
in Torremolinos.

330
00:25:14,336 --> 00:25:18,258
- And if possible, a small yacht.
- And he didn't want anything!

331
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:22,139
No way! Then I want a mink coat!

332
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:26,624
- I want an apartment in downtown Madrid!
- Order! One at a time!

333
00:25:26,744 --> 00:25:29,851
Cancel my pram,
I want a Mercedes 220.

334
00:25:29,971 --> 00:25:32,181
And I want a furnished apartment
with terrace!

335
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:34,899
A washing machine
and a lamp for the dining room!

336
00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:37,890
- And flight tickets to Paris!
- And a farmhouse with everything...

337
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,886
Enough! We're reaching 20 million!

338
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:45,236
- When was there 20 million in the bank?
- There will be.

339
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:50,297
On the 13th, when Don Prudencio
takes office...

340
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:55,015
20 million will be sent from
the construction company's account

341
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:58,376
that must be paid in the afternoon
before a notary.

342
00:25:58,686 --> 00:26:02,608
Just out of curiosity,
how are we going to lift it?

343
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,307
Before the notary gets there,
the brain has everything planned.

344
00:26:06,667 --> 00:26:08,427
This is the plan.

345
00:26:08,686 --> 00:26:14,103
On day X at time D,
three gunmen will enter to the bank.

346
00:26:15,084 --> 00:26:16,721
They'll threaten us with their guns,

347
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:19,566
they'll force us
to fill a suitcase with money,

348
00:26:19,686 --> 00:26:22,611
they'll hit an employee
and take the money...

349
00:26:22,686 --> 00:26:25,286
in a black car that
will wait for them outside.

350
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:28,662
That car will disappear!

351
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:31,578
The robbers
will never be heard from again.

352
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:34,559
They'll be the perpetrators
and we'll be the victims.

353
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,036
We'll even have a witness...

354
00:26:37,878 --> 00:26:39,242
Don Prudencio.

355
00:26:39,317 --> 00:26:41,462
Wait a moment.

356
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:46,469
If the robbers take the money,
we don't get paid.

357
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:49,717
The thing is,
those robbers are here.

358
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:53,361
- Police!
- And we haven't started yet!

359
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:56,086
- Everything is planned!
- OK, but I'm leaving!

360
00:26:56,686 --> 00:26:58,148
- Sit down.
- What should I do?

361
00:26:58,223 --> 00:27:00,472
- Open the door.
- It's over!

362
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,608
Sit down!

363
00:27:02,957 --> 00:27:04,657
Listen.

364
00:27:06,453 --> 00:27:09,185
Good evening.
Sorry for the disturbance.

365
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:12,991
We've run out of water in the radiator,
and we saw a light from your window.

366
00:27:13,066 --> 00:27:15,355
So you just wanted water.
Thank goodness!

367
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,830
Water and everything you want!
For you who serve the citizen...

368
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:21,025
The citizen must collaborate.

369
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:24,078
- Somebody's screaming.
- I didn't heard anything. Did you?

370
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:27,886
I didn't. Why would anyone scream
at this hour?

371
00:27:29,585 --> 00:27:32,032
- Somebody is screaming.
- They're here.

372
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,611
- What's happening to this gentleman?
- Oh, I forgot!

373
00:27:36,686 --> 00:27:39,141
My epileptic cousin. Sometimes
he suffers attacks like this.

374
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,523
The others are also family.

375
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:43,859
- Where does it hurt?
- Here.

376
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:51,288
- We have to take him to the hospital.
- No way. Don't bother...

377
00:27:51,388 --> 00:27:53,979
That's our job.
We'll take him in the patrol car.

378
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,433
- It might be serious.
- I'm much better now!

379
00:27:56,553 --> 00:27:59,278
- He's too pale.
- Help me.

380
00:28:00,198 --> 00:28:04,004
Not the hospital!
They'll cut you open at the drop of a hat!

381
00:28:04,104 --> 00:28:06,566
Shut up
and have surgery if you have to!

382
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,386
Careful with the stairs.

383
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:09,600
The water.

384
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:12,187
OPERATING ROOM

385
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,998
- Poor man. How he suffered.
- We've gotten out of a mess thanks to him.

386
00:28:21,098 --> 00:28:24,086
- Without him we'd be in jail.
- Thank you, janitor.

387
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:29,235
See you soon, mate.

388
00:28:47,098 --> 00:28:48,586
Could you give me a light?

389
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,284
Yes, sir. Right away.

390
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,345
You look nervous today.

391
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:00,165
Me, nervous?

392
00:29:05,696 --> 00:29:07,592
Look at these beautiful mink coats.

393
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:10,745
- This one, 300.000 pesetas.
- A bargain.

394
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:16,392
Lupe is an expert and says that
mink coats are not a luxury item anymore!

395
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:18,631
Beautiful.

396
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:20,706
Isn't that right?

397
00:29:21,415 --> 00:29:23,795
Is that for you?
Are you inheriting any time soon?

398
00:29:24,017 --> 00:29:27,605
- Who knows.
- Miss, from 8 to 4...

399
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:30,445
your time belongs to the bank,
which is paying you.

400
00:29:30,648 --> 00:29:33,445
The bank's money is sacred.

401
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:39,250
He knows something!

402
00:29:55,082 --> 00:29:57,395
Checking accounts?

403
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:00,907
I beg your pardon?

404
00:30:04,774 --> 00:30:06,474
Checking accounts?

405
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:10,395
Here. Checking accounts is here.

406
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:13,780
Good morning.

407
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,197
- I would like to open up an account.
- Of course.

408
00:30:16,317 --> 00:30:18,217
Come in, please.

409
00:30:21,075 --> 00:30:23,395
Allow me, please.

410
00:30:26,832 --> 00:30:29,295
- Take a seat. You'll be more comfortable.
- You're very kind.

411
00:30:30,016 --> 00:30:33,512
In the meantime I'll write down
your details.

412
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,690
What details?

413
00:30:35,765 --> 00:30:37,465
- Sorry?
- What details?

414
00:30:38,094 --> 00:30:39,794
Oh yes!

415
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:45,265
- Your name, please.
- Matilde GÃ³mez Smith.

416
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:50,513
Funny. At first, I thought you were
Katia DurÃ¡n, the popular star.

417
00:30:50,593 --> 00:30:53,545
You look just like her.

418
00:30:54,125 --> 00:30:57,365
I am Katia DurÃ¡n.
That's my "nom de guerre".

419
00:30:57,465 --> 00:31:00,113
- A war I wish to enlist in.
- Thanks.

420
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,090
You're full of grace.

421
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,628
- Residence?
- At the moment, the York Club.

422
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:07,162
- Any inconvenience?
- Not at all!

423
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:09,395
It's a wonderful place.

424
00:31:11,764 --> 00:31:13,644
And how many legs...?
No! I mean...

425
00:31:13,764 --> 00:31:17,185
How much will your first deposit be?

426
00:31:17,851 --> 00:31:19,570
- 600.000.
- 600...

427
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,694
- Did you say 600.000?
- Yes.

428
00:31:26,423 --> 00:31:28,132
Here you are.

429
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:33,384
- Won't you count it?
- No. What for?

430
00:31:33,976 --> 00:31:36,413
- Where do I have to sign?
- Oh yes!

431
00:31:36,627 --> 00:31:39,845
Sign here, as the depositor.

432
00:31:40,763 --> 00:31:43,918
I assume that no one but me will be able
to withdraw money from here.

433
00:31:44,141 --> 00:31:46,195
Nobody withdraws anything here.

434
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:54,025
- Do I have to sign more papers?
- No need.

435
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,312
Thank you very much.

436
00:31:55,412 --> 00:31:58,446
Fernando Galindo,
your fan, friend, slave and servant.

437
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:00,821
I'll send you some invitations
to see my show.

438
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:03,345
You can send me whatever you want.

439
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,617
- Good day.
- At your feet!

440
00:32:27,316 --> 00:32:30,517
Could you pay me in advance
500 pesetas?

441
00:32:30,637 --> 00:32:32,996
- What advance?
- From the stick-up.

442
00:32:33,445 --> 00:32:35,520
Do you really think stick-ups
are paid in advance?

443
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,945
- Don't know. It's my first time.
- Go back to your place.

444
00:32:39,607 --> 00:32:41,591
I really need it.

445
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:43,937
Sit down and shut up!

446
00:32:46,445 --> 00:32:50,545
Amateurs.
You're just a bunch of amateurs.

447
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:53,145
Come in.

448
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:56,277
- If you'll excuse me.
- Come in, Galindo.

449
00:32:57,731 --> 00:33:00,975
- What is it.
- A deposit from a new client.

450
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:05,646
- A really good client!
- You can say that again!

451
00:33:05,766 --> 00:33:07,595
- Do you want a cigarette?
- Thanks.

452
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,145
Tell me, Galindo.

453
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:14,264
- What did the doctor tell you?
- What doctor?

454
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:17,229
- Didn't you go to see the doctor?
- What for?

455
00:33:17,445 --> 00:33:20,727
I don't know. The other day,
you were acting so strangely.

456
00:33:21,064 --> 00:33:24,370
I'm sorry, Don Felipe.
It was a minor mood swing.

457
00:33:24,445 --> 00:33:28,112
Happy to hear that.
I was worried.

458
00:33:28,445 --> 00:33:32,064
You've always been such
an honest, sensible and loyal man.

459
00:33:32,184 --> 00:33:36,103
- Forget about it. Won't happen again.
- It takes a weight off my shoulders.

460
00:33:36,336 --> 00:33:37,440
Thank you very much.

461
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,995
Take care of yourself.

462
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:42,238
You saw that poor guy Martínez.

463
00:33:42,445 --> 00:33:46,510
Thank goodness
he's already on the mend.

464
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:58,937
- It looks delicious!
- They take good care of you.

465
00:33:59,057 --> 00:34:01,549
They treat me like a Duke,
as Mr. Galindo would say.

466
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:04,325
What I haven't eaten yet is caviar.

467
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:07,763
- May I?
- When I ask for it, the little nun says:

468
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:10,070
"This is not the Hilton, son."

469
00:34:10,145 --> 00:34:13,555
- Doesn't your appendix hurt?
- Not at all!

470
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:16,967
I've never been so hungry.

471
00:34:17,384 --> 00:34:21,268
Everyday it's a new menu,
so I'm making a pig of myself!

472
00:34:28,015 --> 00:34:29,715
This is delicious!

473
00:34:30,005 --> 00:34:31,705
I was thinking...

474
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:34,219
while you prepare the stick-up thing...

475
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:41,287
I could stay here a little longer
to finish recovering.

476
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:49,895
- How's the patient doing?
- Well, doctor...

477
00:34:50,015 --> 00:34:53,295
- I'm trying to raise my spirits.
- What a nerve!

478
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:56,238
- Beg your pardon?
- He suffers from nerves.

479
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,691
Are you all right?

480
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:00,015
This appendix is all right,
but the other one...

481
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:01,879
- You joker!
- I'm serious, doc.

482
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:05,837
Why don't you operate on me again?
It's just a cut. So you can practice.

483
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:09,497
Come on. You're good as gold.
You can go home tomorrow.

484
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:12,138
- What difference does it make?
- Deep fried.

485
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:14,879
- They're delicious.
- Good night.

486
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:17,145
Good night.

487
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:21,123
Watch the door.

488
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:26,044
No time to lose.
We'll have a meeting tomorrow night.

489
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:28,177
- Where?
- My house.

490
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,992
No freaking way!

491
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,562
- I got it.
- What?

492
00:35:32,637 --> 00:35:34,425
Our meeting point.

493
00:35:45,886 --> 00:35:48,012
12 o'clock and no sign from Galindo.

494
00:35:48,132 --> 00:35:51,086
Nice meeting point he chose.

495
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:54,295
I bet they busted him.
It's bound to go wrong.

496
00:35:55,003 --> 00:35:57,325
Optimistic as always.

497
00:35:57,445 --> 00:36:00,945
I don't like the look of this.
Maybe it's a trap.

498
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,845
And we're next to the cemetery.

499
00:36:04,965 --> 00:36:08,370
The gravedigger in my village
would say that at midnight...

500
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,145
Shut up.

501
00:36:17,722 --> 00:36:19,543
- Did you hear that?
- What?

502
00:36:19,663 --> 00:36:23,013
- It sounded like chains being dragged.
- Wow, Castrillo!

503
00:36:23,133 --> 00:36:26,116
And I was so cozy in the hospital...

504
00:36:26,236 --> 00:36:29,325
Oh Mr. Benítez!
It seems to me that the angel moved.

505
00:36:29,445 --> 00:36:32,489
Yes, Enriquetita, it has moved!

506
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:35,867
Don't worry.

507
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,370
Hands up!

508
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:52,185
- Don't move!
- Yes sir, whatever you say.

509
00:36:57,987 --> 00:36:59,880
Didn't recognize me, did you?

510
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,479
I just wanted to show you that
no one will be able

511
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,145
- to recognize the robbers.
- You're right.

512
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,695
- Looks like a totally different man!
- What a trick!

513
00:37:10,608 --> 00:37:13,187
All we need is three silk stockings.

514
00:37:13,667 --> 00:37:15,411
You'll buy them.

515
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:19,133
Why not Enriqueta? She's the one
who understands such things.

516
00:37:21,065 --> 00:37:24,983
Enriqueta has a more important mission:
rent a car.

517
00:37:25,103 --> 00:37:27,645
- You're going with her.
- Are we going on a trip?

518
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,576
It's a wedding.
That's what you'll say.

519
00:37:30,696 --> 00:37:33,566
We're renting a wedding car
so they don't get suspicious.

520
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:35,382
And is Mr. Benítez my groom?

521
00:37:35,457 --> 00:37:37,470
- Exactly.
- He's not my type!

522
00:37:37,545 --> 00:37:39,730
Bring her Paul Newman then.

523
00:37:39,805 --> 00:37:42,459
Mr. Benítez,
respects to Paul Newman.

524
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:46,639
- Being short, I also have my audience.
- Don't let's get personal.

525
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:51,625
- And you will be the driver.
- Me?

526
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:56,090
- I can't drive.
- Don't you have a motorcycle? Then learn!

527
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:57,969
It will all go wrong.

528
00:37:58,055 --> 00:38:00,844
- What about me, boss?
- You're buying the guns.

529
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:04,346
- Weren't we supposed to carry machine guns?
- That's it, artillery!

530
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:09,269
Toy guns!
No blood must be spilled.

531
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:12,081
What about the money
for these first expenses, boss?

532
00:38:12,201 --> 00:38:14,325
Pay it yourselves.
You'll get a refund.

533
00:38:14,445 --> 00:38:18,845
Why doesn't the bank anticipate it?
In a few days, it'll be ours.

534
00:38:19,194 --> 00:38:21,444
- He's right, we want an advance!
- Shut up!

535
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:23,812
We must choose the robbers.

536
00:38:24,754 --> 00:38:26,454
Come on!

537
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,270
Stop!

538
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:32,851
Form a line.
Come on!

539
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:37,317
Me first, boss!
Give me the money! Ta-ta-ta!

540
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:43,390
- Perfect face of a psychopathic murderer.
- Don't disrespect me, Mr. Galindo.

541
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:46,382
- This one is small fry.
- Take another look.

542
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:49,565
Wearing a hat pulled down to his eyebrows
he could be good for the job.

543
00:38:49,685 --> 00:38:51,106
Look this way.

544
00:38:51,181 --> 00:38:54,667
Not you! You'll cough in a minute.
See?

545
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,539
You'll be the third robber.

546
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,521
You're wrong.
I'm a good guy.

547
00:39:00,803 --> 00:39:03,106
- I'll screw it up.
- You'll not!

548
00:39:03,181 --> 00:39:04,890
- They're here!
- The police again!

549
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,482
- What a life!
- Disperse!

550
00:39:07,909 --> 00:39:10,955
- Don't run, that'll make things worse!
- Hit the dirt!

551
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:14,510
What a job!
It's one thing after another!

552
00:39:26,224 --> 00:39:27,730
When's the wedding?

553
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:29,805
- What wedding?
- I don't know.

554
00:39:30,232 --> 00:39:32,032
Yours.

555
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,128
Didn't you want to rent a car
for your honeymoon?

556
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,228
Sure, our wedding!

557
00:39:37,348 --> 00:39:39,117
You tell him, lollipop.

558
00:39:39,192 --> 00:39:43,325
- No, you tell him, my little mouse.
- You tell him, my tiger.

559
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:47,745
- You, my angel!
- Why don't you flip a coin?

560
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:50,140
- Put any date you like.
- But soon.

561
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,283
Right, my little mouse?

562
00:39:52,546 --> 00:39:55,755
Mr. Benítez,
you're getting a little too frisky.

563
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:59,354
- No trespassing!
- It's just that you're good for me.

564
00:39:59,779 --> 00:40:02,852
Do you want me to call the priest
and save time?

565
00:40:04,197 --> 00:40:05,591
Pretty hunny bunny.

566
00:40:07,756 --> 00:40:10,217
Don't move, stranger.
You're trapped.

567
00:40:15,445 --> 00:40:16,698
Damn you!

568
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:20,325
- Give me those guns!
- I'll see you at the Vulture Gorge!

569
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,967
I'll give you vulture...!

570
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,505
- My appendix.
- You're wounded, but not finished off.

571
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:28,815
Drop that!

572
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:31,620
Finally you remember
your son's birthday...

573
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,340
- but three guns are too much.
- They're not for him.

574
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:37,190
- For whom then?
- For the orphans!

575
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,971
Oh Lord, you're going to kill me!
I'm in pain!

576
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,850
Shall we go to the maternity unit?

577
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,620
Bad father!
Spending money on other children...

578
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,082
and we don't have a carriage for
our future baby.

579
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:52,557
Calm down, Luisa...
And you shut up!

580
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:55,390
Leave the guns for the boy!

581
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,951
Let's go after the Indians!

582
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:03,081
Bye.

583
00:41:06,604 --> 00:41:08,750
I'm tired of you spying on me.
That was my boss.

584
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,934
- Got a brand new Chevrolet.
- Lolita!

585
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,546
While we were leaving the office, he said
"Do you want us to try it?"

586
00:41:14,666 --> 00:41:18,090
- I said, why not.
- It's OK.

587
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,352
- Bye!
- No more rides.

588
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,640
No more bosses...

589
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,352
and no more waiting for you
two hours everyday!

590
00:41:26,472 --> 00:41:28,439
- From tomorrow...
- What's this?

591
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,546
- Nothing!
- Give me that.

592
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:35,565
A pair of tights!
And they're horrible too.

593
00:41:36,614 --> 00:41:39,020
- You've got a double life.
- I've not, Lolita!

594
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,020
- I'll explain to you.
- Tell me now or I'll scratch you.

595
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,510
You know how jealous I am.
Who did you buy them for?

596
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,193
Even if I tell you,
you won't believe me.

597
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:48,177
Shut up, liar!
Doing this to me after five years.

598
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,332
Get out of my sight!
I won't see you ever again!

599
00:41:50,452 --> 00:41:52,840
Lolita, it's not what you think!

600
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:55,436
Come on! Faster!

601
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,924
Speed up!

602
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,429
Clutch and shift.

603
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:02,751
Come on, come on!

604
00:42:05,759 --> 00:42:09,691
- Stop!
- Make up your mind! What do I do?

605
00:42:09,934 --> 00:42:11,690
- Stop, you moron!
- Stop it!

606
00:42:15,274 --> 00:42:19,090
You can't do any stick-up
at this speed!

607
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,983
Police again.

608
00:42:24,983 --> 00:42:26,698
- How are you doing?
- Something wrong?

609
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:29,140
Not at all!
We're just testing a car.

610
00:42:29,701 --> 00:42:31,902
And it goes smoothly!
What can we do for you?

611
00:42:31,977 --> 00:42:33,607
Nothing, thank you.

612
00:42:33,682 --> 00:42:35,682
Have fun.

613
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:38,065
Bye, officer.

614
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,678
- Disperse!
- He's gone.

615
00:42:40,798 --> 00:42:43,138
- He looked at us in a bad way.
- Shut up, jinx!

616
00:42:43,258 --> 00:42:46,235
Let's do it again.
See if you find out how to shift.

617
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,872
That's right, someone else can drive.

618
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:51,190
You don't move
until you reach 80 kmh.

619
00:42:51,798 --> 00:42:53,798
Start the car.

620
00:42:54,497 --> 00:42:56,890
Not that way!

621
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,445
- Clutch.
- He doesn't have a clue.

622
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,614
- Clutch and neutral gear.
- Let's see.

623
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,895
- Start the car.
- Come on!

624
00:43:06,109 --> 00:43:08,590
Come on!

625
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:12,831
Enriquetita, come here.

626
00:43:12,951 --> 00:43:15,790
Mr. Benítez, you don't have to do
the boyfriend role anymore.

627
00:43:16,161 --> 00:43:19,161
I took it so seriously that I think
I'm on my honeymoon.

628
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,390
Watch out!

629
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,640
- Oh my God!
- Slow down, Castrillo!

630
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:30,675
Stop, Castrillo!

631
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,440
Hit the brakes!
It's the middle pedal!

632
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,680
- Could you give me a light?
- Yes, sir.

633
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,740
I warned you.
Motorcycles are dangerous.

634
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:08,387
It wasn't driving a motorcycle,
but a car.

635
00:44:08,487 --> 00:44:10,321
A car?

636
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:14,090
Well, not driving a car.
I mean, the other vehicle was a car.

637
00:44:16,686 --> 00:44:18,997
I was riding in the countryside...

638
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:23,540
Not the countryside.

639
00:44:24,832 --> 00:44:26,532
Suddenly, boom!

640
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,840
- A big crash.
- I remind you that accidents...

641
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,820
due to such frivolities do not have
the right to compensation.

642
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,840
Yes.

643
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,159
Wrecked?
It was just a little hit against a tree.

644
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:48,861
The driver only has a bump
that can't be seen.

645
00:44:48,981 --> 00:44:52,240
No sir!
We don't fix cars here!

646
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,060
This is a bank.

647
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,910
- What a pain in the neck!
- You can't fool me, miss.

648
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,803
You were riding as a pillion with him.

649
00:44:59,923 --> 00:45:02,657
Pillion?
He should be so lucky!

650
00:45:02,777 --> 00:45:06,890
I'm really sorry
because I like that fly swatter business.

651
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,640
It's only 50.000 pesetas, Don Felipe.

652
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,340
- Another credit?
- Yes, but as I told him...

653
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,640
- it can't be done.
- Exactly.

654
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,419
Those days are over. No one
takes a peseta from this bank anymore.

655
00:45:18,494 --> 00:45:20,594
Ha-ha!

656
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:28,385
Fresh milk.
Now you can't say I'm not thoughtful.

657
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,673
I appreciate it,
but milk disagrees with me.

658
00:45:31,978 --> 00:45:35,342
- It's 9 pesetas a liter! - Doesn't matter,
it doesn't agree with me.

659
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:39,649
Miss Katia!
Such a nice pleasure.

660
00:45:39,769 --> 00:45:42,890
Your fan, friend, slave and servant.
Come in.

661
00:45:43,759 --> 00:45:45,785
Please, sit down.

662
00:45:45,905 --> 00:45:50,195
- I just came to ask you something.
- Whatever you want.

663
00:45:50,636 --> 00:45:54,461
- Has a transfer arrived for me?
- It hasn't.

664
00:45:54,937 --> 00:45:56,509
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

665
00:45:56,584 --> 00:45:59,840
I am the only one
in charge of your account.

666
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,289
- Can I ask you a favor?
- You can count on me.

667
00:46:03,633 --> 00:46:07,390
When that transfer arrives,
will you come to the club to let me know?

668
00:46:09,312 --> 00:46:11,312
- Just me, you know?
- Yes.

669
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:14,759
If I'm not alone,
don't say anything.

670
00:46:15,332 --> 00:46:19,507
All right. I go to the club,
I come into your dressing room...

671
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:22,800
and you will be there waiting for me...

672
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:24,834
Alone?

673
00:46:26,934 --> 00:46:29,040
In case
the transfer hasn't arrived yet,

674
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,020
can I come over anyways?

675
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,545
You can come over anytime.

676
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:37,507
You'll be always well-received.

677
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:41,555
Sir, they want to charge us
3500 pesetas to fix our car.

678
00:46:41,675 --> 00:46:44,020
- Don't interrupt.
- They're on the phone.

679
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:47,448
- Don Pruden isn't around, it has to be now.
- Let them fix it then!

680
00:46:47,662 --> 00:46:50,290
Your fan, friend, slave and servant.

681
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:55,654
Yes, have it fixed.
But it will look like brand new, right?

682
00:46:56,982 --> 00:47:00,367
Cylinder head? Pinions?
What's that?

683
00:47:01,953 --> 00:47:04,880
Oh well! Have it fixed.

684
00:47:16,321 --> 00:47:20,283
Painted and with new license plates,
no one will recognize it.

685
00:47:20,358 --> 00:47:25,620
- Not so fast. This paint doesn't adhere.
- And there's not enough.

686
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:29,020
- Add more water.
- Then we're going to wash it.

687
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,066
All you need is two longitudinal stripes
to make it look brand new.

688
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:37,940
- You're a genius!
- I think there are two million left over.

689
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:41,253
This money is for Don Felipe.

690
00:47:41,373 --> 00:47:45,240
- It'll be his life annuity.
- That's great. Good for us.

691
00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:50,020
Life annuity for Don Felipe.

692
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:53,201
It's the least we can do.

693
00:47:55,311 --> 00:47:57,628
Now the accounts balance.
Three million each.

694
00:47:57,748 --> 00:48:00,835
Three million each?

695
00:48:01,364 --> 00:48:03,298
Come on, let's paint!

696
00:48:03,418 --> 00:48:08,295
This car will look brand new even
if we have to paint during working hours.

697
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,190
- Hi. Would you buy me a drink?
- Sure.

698
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:32,226
- It cost me five bucks to come.
- What have you dressed up as?

699
00:48:32,366 --> 00:48:34,084
Robber.

700
00:48:34,648 --> 00:48:38,411
Ignoramus! One can tell
that you don't go to the movies.

701
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,415
You look very provocative, dear.

702
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:43,828
Cover yourself up
before you catch cold.

703
00:48:43,948 --> 00:48:47,314
Can't I show off my charms?

704
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:51,000
Sure you can.
You are made so fine.

705
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,618
I hadn't realized until now.

706
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,840
Perverse...

707
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,663
Stop it! That's enough.

708
00:48:59,783 --> 00:49:01,557
Let's practice.

709
00:49:01,677 --> 00:49:05,317
- The robbers. Make a line.
- Yes, boss!

710
00:49:05,437 --> 00:49:07,061
Let's see the stockings.

711
00:49:07,136 --> 00:49:08,836
The stockings.

712
00:49:09,007 --> 00:49:10,435
- Stockings?
- Mine?

713
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,838
He's the one.

714
00:49:11,913 --> 00:49:14,405
- Didn't you hear? Stockings!
- What stockings?

715
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,240
- The ones you were supposed to buy.
- Well...

716
00:49:17,803 --> 00:49:20,540
I forgot them at home.

717
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,837
- We can't work this way!
- How careless!

718
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:29,235
- We could put on a scarf.
- Handkerchiefs!

719
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:31,425
You, the guns.

720
00:49:31,521 --> 00:49:33,871
There were only 9 long ones
and they looked awful,

721
00:49:33,991 --> 00:49:36,144
but the day after tomorrow
you'll have them here

722
00:49:36,219 --> 00:49:39,861
- even though my baby was born with
a birthmark. -This can't be happening!

723
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:41,640
We can't practice like this.

724
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:43,490
Calm down, boss.

725
00:49:43,745 --> 00:49:46,589
If we're not going to shoot,
what do we need guns for?

726
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:51,240
- We point with our fingers.
- Okay whatever! To the car!

727
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,290
Today is the 13th, D day.

728
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:57,571
Get ready.

729
00:50:01,975 --> 00:50:05,693
It's 3 o'clock.
You stop at the front door.

730
00:50:05,943 --> 00:50:10,135
Does it have to be at the door? We won't be
able to park and there's the street light.

731
00:50:10,965 --> 00:50:12,488
Get out of the car!

732
00:50:12,563 --> 00:50:15,543
- Where are you going?
- You said get out of the car.

733
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,943
Not you!
You have to be in the car, idling!

734
00:50:19,829 --> 00:50:21,529
Again.

735
00:50:21,645 --> 00:50:23,443
Get out of the car!

736
00:50:23,965 --> 00:50:26,343
Didn't I tell you to stay in the car?!

737
00:50:26,955 --> 00:50:29,252
Yes, I'm very nervous though.

738
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:33,243
It's not happening! I wonder how
Al Capone would deal with this.

739
00:50:33,392 --> 00:50:35,790
Don't be upset, boss.
Everything is going smoothly.

740
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,843
I don't know. Come on!

741
00:50:37,963 --> 00:50:40,703
- With the engine running?
- Idling!

742
00:50:40,943 --> 00:50:43,907
- Where is the suitcase?
- Here.

743
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,343
We are in our positions.

744
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:49,443
The front door is here!

745
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:56,117
- What a suitcase!
- The only one I have!

746
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:57,937
My counter.

747
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:06,014
No shooting!

748
00:51:10,685 --> 00:51:12,538
Say the words.

749
00:51:13,509 --> 00:51:17,159
- Fa...
- Face against the wall!

750
00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:21,559
Hands up!

751
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:25,344
- Turn around. That's it.
- This is exciting.

752
00:51:25,742 --> 00:51:28,645
Now Martínez, you come to the window
with the suitcase

753
00:51:28,765 --> 00:51:32,378
- and I'll fill it with bills.
- The money!

754
00:51:35,412 --> 00:51:37,049
- Wait a minute, boss!
- What is it?

755
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:39,791
We forgot to gag Mr. Cordero.

756
00:51:39,911 --> 00:51:43,028
What for?
You don't need to rehearse that!

757
00:51:43,288 --> 00:51:46,413
We have to rehearse everything!
Put some adhesive tape over his mouth.

758
00:51:46,488 --> 00:51:48,521
- We don't have that.
- Use sticky tape then.

759
00:51:48,596 --> 00:51:51,728
- We don't have that either.
- Don't worry, I'll be fine.

760
00:51:51,879 --> 00:51:55,748
- And what are you going to put on me?
- A big diamond ring on your finger.

761
00:51:55,823 --> 00:51:59,286
- I'm excited!
- Chloroform for her!

762
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:01,917
- We don't have that.
- It's OK. I'll give it to her.

763
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:03,737
You have to be at the door!

764
00:52:03,843 --> 00:52:06,480
- What a pity!
- What about Don Prudencio?

765
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:10,549
- You shoot him!
- No! No blood must be spilled!

766
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:13,500
He has to see everything.
He'll be the witness.

767
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:17,088
Can I turn back?
I can't see anything and I'm bored.

768
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:19,558
Shut up!
I think everything is set.

769
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:24,272
All you need to do is hit me on the head.
But carefully, gently.

770
00:52:24,781 --> 00:52:27,478
Here on the left side.

771
00:52:27,713 --> 00:52:30,619
- I can't bring myself to do it, boss.
- Hit me.

772
00:52:30,694 --> 00:52:33,994
- What do I hit you with?
- Oh, right.

773
00:52:36,128 --> 00:52:37,828
Here.

774
00:52:40,627 --> 00:52:43,821
Not like that!
Don Prudencio will be watching.

775
00:52:44,608 --> 00:52:46,528
It has to look real.

776
00:52:46,648 --> 00:52:50,122
- You hit me and I get knocked out.
- Now you'll see.

777
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,828
Take this!

778
00:52:57,128 --> 00:52:58,967
That was perfect, right boss?!

779
00:52:59,656 --> 00:53:01,909
What a man!
Your rehearsals are brilliant!

780
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:04,356
Boss?

781
00:53:05,453 --> 00:53:07,153
Boss?

782
00:53:08,821 --> 00:53:10,521
Boss?

783
00:53:12,161 --> 00:53:13,861
Mr. Galindo?!

784
00:53:14,656 --> 00:53:17,404
- What have you done to him?
- He killed him!

785
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:19,530
Don't play jokes.

786
00:53:20,602 --> 00:53:22,902
He's not reacting.

787
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:57,512
This is because I fell down the stairs.
Can't I fall down the stairs?

788
00:53:57,587 --> 00:54:00,073
You can fall wherever you want,

789
00:54:00,148 --> 00:54:02,267
but you must know that
leave isn't granted

790
00:54:02,342 --> 00:54:05,334
when suffering accidents
outside office hours.

791
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,183
Did I ask for leave?

792
00:54:07,258 --> 00:54:10,783
I'm tired of you threatening everyone!

793
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,427
Galindo!
You are talking to the branch director.

794
00:54:15,611 --> 00:54:18,721
Until the 13th, you are not
a director of anything.

795
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:22,123
I will report you to the upper management!
And all of you too!

796
00:54:22,198 --> 00:54:25,478
Do you think I haven't noticed?
Strange things have been happening for days.

797
00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:29,006
I warn you that if you plot anything
against me, it will cost you dearly!

798
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:31,778
I will be inexorable with the rebels!

799
00:54:41,627 --> 00:54:43,550
Coffee and aspirin.

800
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:45,578
- How are you doing, boss?
- Badly.

801
00:54:45,698 --> 00:54:48,605
- Does it hurt?
- It does, but I put up with it.

802
00:54:48,906 --> 00:54:50,867
What was inside the sock?

803
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,479
Sand.

804
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:55,008
You're a brute!
You hit me as hard as you could!

805
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:58,177
- You told me to hit you hard.
- Galindo.

806
00:54:58,297 --> 00:55:03,231
The transfer of 500.000 from your client
and the check book have arrived.

807
00:55:03,488 --> 00:55:06,008
All right. I'll let her know.

808
00:55:06,394 --> 00:55:08,744
- Such bad luck!
- Why?

809
00:55:09,128 --> 00:55:13,008
- Is it too visible?
- It's because of the adhesive tape.

810
00:55:13,128 --> 00:55:17,246
You were lucky.
A little further down and you're done.

811
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:22,024
- I fell down the stairs.
- Yes, it's one misfortune after another.

812
00:55:22,321 --> 00:55:26,028
First, Martínez, then, Castrillo
and now you.

813
00:55:27,268 --> 00:55:29,550
Who's next?

814
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:49,423
<i>Once, I met a very pretty girl</i>

815
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:56,122
<i>Without knowing,
she was trying to play at love</i>

816
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:03,889
<i>At her feet, four hearts were sighing</i>

817
00:56:06,006 --> 00:56:10,686
<i>But she mercilessly destroyed them</i>

818
00:56:12,381 --> 00:56:14,802
<i>She has no heart</i>

819
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,851
<i>She has no heart</i>

820
00:56:19,665 --> 00:56:21,960
<i>She has no heart...</i>

821
00:56:35,028 --> 00:56:39,557
<i>Because she mercilessly destroyed them</i>

822
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:47,326
<i>You will see that this story
is very sad and very silly</i>

823
00:56:49,491 --> 00:56:53,911
<i>because when
she finally wanted to choose,</i>

824
00:56:56,612 --> 00:57:02,008
<i>she found that
there was none at her side</i>

825
00:57:03,913 --> 00:57:08,390
<i>and the girl ended up sad and lonely</i>

826
00:57:39,671 --> 00:57:43,438
<i>And the girl ended up...</i>

827
00:57:43,953 --> 00:57:46,632
<i>sad and lonely.</i>

828
00:58:09,449 --> 00:58:12,255
- Tony.
- Hello, baby.

829
00:58:24,896 --> 00:58:28,488
- Are you surprised to see me?
- I thought you were in Hamburg.

830
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:31,909
Don't act naive.

831
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:35,059
You know too well that
I had to get out of there.

832
00:58:35,401 --> 00:58:37,859
Someone told the police.

833
00:58:38,362 --> 00:58:41,401
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

834
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,653
Maybe you know the rat.

835
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:48,509
- I don't know anything.
- It's OK.

836
00:58:49,381 --> 00:58:51,245
I'll find him somehow.

837
00:58:54,152 --> 00:58:55,805
- Where's the money?
- I don't know!

838
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,032
Bullshit! They gave you 600.000
pesetas and then other 500.

839
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:01,673
That's not true!

840
00:59:02,709 --> 00:59:04,761
Don't make me mad, baby.

841
00:59:06,246 --> 00:59:07,946
Come on.

842
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:10,376
Am I disturbing you?

843
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,430
Hi, darling!
I was waiting for you.

844
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,709
No, I'm the cashier...

845
00:59:17,979 --> 00:59:19,679
Hey. Hey!

846
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:22,649
- What's that?
- My boyfriend.

847
00:59:26,882 --> 00:59:28,454
Listen, baby...

848
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:29,855
Don't play with me.

849
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:31,959
- Listen!
- Shut your trap!

850
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:34,309
I need it tonight.

851
00:59:36,367 --> 00:59:38,011
Otherwise...

852
00:59:38,086 --> 00:59:41,367
- Let me alone, Tony. Go away.
- Didn't you hear the lady? Go away...

853
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:43,709
Tonight.

854
00:59:47,697 --> 00:59:49,709
Don't forget.

855
00:59:54,076 --> 00:59:57,193
Hitting women, you coward.
Why don't you hit me?

856
00:59:57,313 --> 01:00:00,359
- Say that again?
- Nothing. Have fun.

857
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:06,921
I'd teach him a lesson,
but not in your presence.

858
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:09,909
Careful! He may be listening.

859
01:00:11,624 --> 01:00:14,131
- Any news about the transfer?
- That's why I'm here.

860
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:16,095
To bring you the news
and the checkbook.

861
01:00:16,215 --> 01:00:19,059
- I'm getting dressed. Sit down.
- Thanks.

862
01:00:26,802 --> 01:00:28,509
Thank goodness you came.

863
01:00:28,629 --> 01:00:32,443
A helpless woman always needs
a loyal man by her side.

864
01:00:32,841 --> 01:00:34,920
Yes, ma'am.

865
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:40,396
And a man always needs a woman.

866
01:00:41,155 --> 01:00:43,804
- Mind if I call you by your first name?
- No, ma'am.

867
01:00:48,684 --> 01:00:50,889
Do you have plans for tonight?

868
01:00:51,449 --> 01:00:52,880
We could have dinner together.

869
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:57,059
We have dinner, a snack, dinner again
and whatever you want.

870
01:01:04,076 --> 01:01:06,376
- To you.
- No. To you.

871
01:01:06,608 --> 01:01:08,859
- To us.
- Right. To us.

872
01:01:18,157 --> 01:01:20,969
It's 3 o'clock. He's not coming.
Something must have happened to him.

873
01:01:22,382 --> 01:01:24,951
- What are we gonna do now?
- Let's get out of here.

874
01:01:25,466 --> 01:01:29,089
- What about the stick-up?
- Let's forget about it.

875
01:01:29,461 --> 01:01:31,883
Why? The rehearsals went very well.

876
01:01:32,255 --> 01:01:35,990
- Without him, we can't do anything.
- He's right. Galindo is the brain.

877
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:42,990
- I had already chosen my Studebaker!
- Three beautiful suits in my case!

878
01:01:43,257 --> 01:01:46,042
I won't be able to enjoy the caviar!

879
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:48,593
- And the baby's stroller.
- I'm happy!

880
01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:52,089
Let's go home happily, no remorse.

881
01:01:52,358 --> 01:01:56,225
No, sir! I'll do the stick-up
with or without him.

882
01:01:56,325 --> 01:01:59,325
- Do you think any of this is real?
- What?

883
01:01:59,762 --> 01:02:03,828
All of it.
Your house, the champagne, yourself.

884
01:02:05,613 --> 01:02:07,309
Yes, it is.

885
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:11,034
It doesn't feel like it's real.
It all seems like a dream...

886
01:02:11,407 --> 01:02:15,211
and I'm going to wake up
in the bank counting cents.

887
01:02:16,338 --> 01:02:18,959
I'm here, with you.

888
01:02:33,034 --> 01:02:35,231
Your checkbook.

889
01:02:35,662 --> 01:02:39,590
- You have to promise me one thing.
- Anything. I'll promise you anything.

890
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:44,142
If that man asks at the bank if I have
an account, you tell him I don't.

891
01:02:44,731 --> 01:02:47,661
What does that man mean to you?

892
01:02:47,804 --> 01:02:50,384
- It's a long history.
- Tell me right now.

893
01:02:50,587 --> 01:02:54,134
He's my brother. A rascal.
He wants to take my money.

894
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,279
I find myself alone, helpless.

895
01:02:57,522 --> 01:03:00,604
You have me!
Here I am to defend...

896
01:03:00,724 --> 01:03:02,424
My glasses!

897
01:03:04,891 --> 01:03:06,800
- Who cares?
- You're so nice.

898
01:03:07,104 --> 01:03:10,584
- It's a shame we have to separate.
- Now? We just met.

899
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:14,378
- No way! - I have to leave
before he takes my money.

900
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:17,858
Yes. We'll leave together,
to a place very far from here.

901
01:03:17,978 --> 01:03:20,134
Where no one knows us.

902
01:03:20,234 --> 01:03:22,897
To Jamaica, Haiti, or Port-au-Prince.

903
01:03:22,997 --> 01:03:27,143
Rocked by the tropical breeze,
and we will get married.

904
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:30,074
- Right?
- That's not possible.

905
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:33,182
I'll be rich in a few days.

906
01:03:33,466 --> 01:03:37,182
- You?
- Yes. 20 million.

907
01:03:37,282 --> 01:03:41,677
- Well, I'll have to share it.
- What are you talking about?

908
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,985
I can't hide it from you.
It's an amazing business...

909
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:52,240
Silence.
I heard footsteps.

910
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,976
Maybe it's him.

911
01:04:01,789 --> 01:04:03,489
Stop!

912
01:04:09,575 --> 01:04:11,786
You go look.
It'll be less suspicious.

913
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,110
Mr. Benítez!
You've been pretty clingy lately.

914
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:28,849
- You rascal!
- I like the way you are, my robber!

915
01:04:34,886 --> 01:04:37,148
Oh, my!
Who turned the light off?

916
01:04:37,268 --> 01:04:40,668
- The fuses have blown!
- Mr. Benítez, I'll hit you!

917
01:04:47,936 --> 01:04:52,420
- A bus accident. Something wrong?
- Not at all.

918
01:04:56,818 --> 01:04:59,585
- Any news from Galindo?
- He didn't sleep at home.

919
01:04:59,811 --> 01:05:01,549
- This is bad.
- Of course it's bad.

920
01:05:01,624 --> 01:05:04,895
- Maybe he was held and he'll sing...
- Shut up!

921
01:05:07,682 --> 01:05:10,478
Don't worry. If you forget something,
I'll have it sent to your house.

922
01:05:10,598 --> 01:05:13,051
I'll forget something, for sure.

923
01:05:13,633 --> 01:05:19,156
It's been many years here.
It was already like home.

924
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:24,041
Finally...
Everything ends.

925
01:05:25,142 --> 01:05:26,009
Everything.

926
01:05:26,109 --> 01:05:28,173
On the contrary.
Now is the time to enjoy life.

927
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:29,783
Yes, right.

928
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,586
- You can keep the flowers.
- The keys.

929
01:05:34,706 --> 01:05:36,954
Oh, the keys! Of course!

930
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:39,372
And the inventory.

931
01:05:39,696 --> 01:05:42,436
All right.
I'll check it out properly.

932
01:05:57,352 --> 01:06:01,264
Enriqueta, I'll miss you so much.

933
01:06:01,384 --> 01:06:05,816
- Come on, you must be strong.
- I can't help it.

934
01:06:05,936 --> 01:06:09,876
I am very sorry.
You have been like a father to me.

935
01:06:15,633 --> 01:06:17,333
Cordero.

936
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:19,636
Like a father to all of us.

937
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:23,636
My dears.

938
01:06:23,818 --> 01:06:26,465
- Benítez.
- We'll never forget you.

939
01:06:26,585 --> 01:06:29,286
- Castrillo.
- We'll come over some time.

940
01:06:31,488 --> 01:06:33,701
- Galindo?
- He's not here.

941
01:06:33,821 --> 01:06:36,565
Say goodbye to him when he comes.

942
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:45,474
Mr. Director, even if you leave,
I'll always be your janitor.

943
01:06:45,594 --> 01:06:47,816
This is for you,
from my savings.

944
01:06:47,936 --> 01:06:52,057
It's rolling tobacco.
So your little thing doesn't get plugged.

945
01:07:06,447 --> 01:07:08,147
Goodbye everybody.

946
01:07:11,936 --> 01:07:15,428
Enough sentimentality.
Let's get back to work!

947
01:07:15,805 --> 01:07:19,622
Apparently Mr. Galindo thinks
that today is a holiday.

948
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:23,756
Let him have it. He's done.
He doesn't know who I am.

949
01:07:26,311 --> 01:07:28,457
Good morning everybody!

950
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:33,816
I've been ambling on my way here,
the trees are already beginning to bloom

951
01:07:33,936 --> 01:07:35,836
and the birds are chirping
in their nests.

952
01:07:35,936 --> 01:07:39,425
- I'll be a bird too and I'll fly.
- Listen to me, Galindo...

953
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:43,112
Chin up, Don Prudencio,
spring is here. Take a deep breath.

954
01:07:43,187 --> 01:07:47,887
Is this a joke? You're talking
with the branch director.

955
01:07:48,328 --> 01:07:49,431
Already?

956
01:07:49,506 --> 01:07:52,515
Of course. You thought this moment
would never come, right?

957
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,262
- It came!
- Good. Yes, sir.

958
01:07:55,382 --> 01:08:00,258
Birds are not chirping anymore,
no one flies, and nothing at all blooms.

959
01:08:01,019 --> 01:08:04,758
I'll get to work right away,
Mr. Branch Director.

960
01:08:14,384 --> 01:08:17,661
- Where on earth were you last night?
- Where?

961
01:08:18,631 --> 01:08:22,311
I was meditating,
and preparing everything.

962
01:08:23,519 --> 01:08:28,825
Tonight we'll hold an urgent meeting.
All the details must be set.

963
01:08:30,499 --> 01:08:31,480
Come on.

964
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:37,210
Point A: transformer.
From here the car must leave

965
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:43,563
at 2:48 p.m. to arrive
at point B at 2:51 p.m.,

966
01:08:43,663 --> 01:08:46,440
then supermarket,
return to the square...

967
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:50,259
- But the supermarket isn't there.
- Don't interrupt!

968
01:08:50,612 --> 01:08:53,394
Point B, supermarket,
return to the square...

969
01:08:53,469 --> 01:08:55,081
If the supermarket is there,
where is the bank?

970
01:08:55,181 --> 01:08:57,483
The bank is point X,
there's still a long way to go.

971
01:08:57,583 --> 01:08:58,895
- Sorry, boss...
- Shut up!

972
01:08:58,995 --> 01:09:00,795
Let me make myself clear...

973
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:03,908
Point A, transformer.

974
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:08,876
From here the car must leave
at 2:48 p.m. to arrive at 2:51 p.m...

975
01:09:08,976 --> 01:09:12,403
Yes, but I think that way leads
to the airport.

976
01:09:12,478 --> 01:09:14,221
- The thing is...
- Keep quiet!

977
01:09:14,296 --> 01:09:17,647
I know what I'm saying,
this is a map with a rigorous scale.

978
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:24,422
Point B, supermarket, return
to the square, exit through point C...

979
01:09:24,497 --> 01:09:27,297
- No, it cannot be...
- Wait. Try now, boss!

980
01:09:30,714 --> 01:09:34,914
That's it, you put it back to front!
You only complicate things!

981
01:09:34,989 --> 01:09:39,047
When will we split the money?

982
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:42,797
Later on, when everything
has been forgotten.

983
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:44,932
What if it's not forgotten?

984
01:09:45,032 --> 01:09:48,947
We must be cautious,
no one should know that we are rich.

985
01:09:49,092 --> 01:09:51,602
I'll keep the money in a safe place.

986
01:09:51,677 --> 01:09:55,733
Wouldn't it be better
to open a checking account?

987
01:09:55,833 --> 01:09:58,497
Do you want us all in prison?

988
01:09:58,879 --> 01:10:01,083
Haste is the downfall of the ambitious.

989
01:10:01,203 --> 01:10:04,196
- Will we have to continue working?
- Of course.

990
01:10:04,316 --> 01:10:07,696
- Why do the stick-up at all then?
- A perfect stick-up is like that,

991
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:09,834
that's why they never
find out who the robbers are.

992
01:10:09,934 --> 01:10:12,527
Leave it to the boss, he's on the ball.
Can I keep the bus?

993
01:10:12,602 --> 01:10:14,202
Keep quiet!

994
01:10:14,297 --> 01:10:19,781
We can also take all the money
in the box, for the early expenses.

995
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:23,403
- That's great.
- Let's see...

996
01:10:23,762 --> 01:10:26,297
- Do you remember everything?
- Yes, boss, at a quarter to two...

997
01:10:26,397 --> 01:10:29,292
- I'll pretend to feel sick.
- That's it.

998
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,151
And you two
will take him to the hospital.

999
01:10:32,497 --> 01:10:34,677
- And I will stay.
- No!

1000
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:39,156
You three will go to point A,
the transformer.

1001
01:10:39,771 --> 01:10:43,951
You will pass along H Street,
then you reach point F...

1002
01:10:44,281 --> 01:10:48,122
before the traffic light turns red
and reaching point G,

1003
01:10:48,197 --> 01:10:51,005
you'll back up to pretend...

1004
01:10:51,607 --> 01:10:54,342
and at 3 o'clock...

1005
01:10:55,186 --> 01:10:56,842
you'll arrive at the bank.

1006
01:10:57,617 --> 01:11:01,000
Is it clear?
Let's practice.

1007
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:09,811
It seems to me
that they're taking too long.

1008
01:11:15,727 --> 01:11:17,200
They're here.

1009
01:11:18,869 --> 01:11:21,883
Looks like his driving skills
are much better.

1010
01:11:25,097 --> 01:11:28,177
Careful with the street light!

1011
01:11:28,597 --> 01:11:31,546
- Will you ever learn to drive?
- That was close!

1012
01:11:32,151 --> 01:11:34,623
- How was it?
- Bad. 20 minutes late.

1013
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:39,167
And thank goodness we've arrived,
because J Street is under construction.

1014
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:43,433
- Forget J Street. Come through K Street.
- K Street?

1015
01:11:43,533 --> 01:11:46,597
- The one with the pharmacy.
- It's the wrong direction.

1016
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:49,402
Everything is a problem!

1017
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:52,235
- L Street then.
- No way out.

1018
01:11:52,355 --> 01:11:56,613
Why don't we go straight down the main
street instead of taking so many detours?

1019
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:59,659
Sure, so everyone can see you!

1020
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,927
- Neither M nor N...
- A churro?

1021
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:06,878
- No thanks. P, K, S...
- You'll run out of the alphabet, boss!

1022
01:12:07,124 --> 01:12:11,574
- That's it! S Street.
- Which one is that?

1023
01:12:11,933 --> 01:12:15,686
Main Street!
Do I have to explain it all?

1024
01:12:17,397 --> 01:12:19,092
- Any questions?
- No, boss.

1025
01:12:19,167 --> 01:12:20,897
- Everything is ready?
- Yes, boss.

1026
01:12:31,217 --> 01:12:34,277
- When do they pay me the check?
- They're checking the signature.

1027
01:12:34,397 --> 01:12:36,596
- Boss. This is a tragedy.
- What's wrong?

1028
01:12:36,837 --> 01:12:39,277
We have to delay the stick-up,
my wife is in labor.

1029
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,248
- This is a very serious thing.
- And what about having a baby?

1030
01:12:42,369 --> 01:12:46,277
You can't have a baby now!
It has to be a mistake.

1031
01:12:46,397 --> 01:12:50,523
You don't know my wife.
When she gets down to it, no one can stop her.

1032
01:12:50,598 --> 01:12:52,652
Stop her! When life
gives you lemons, make lemonade!

1033
01:12:52,727 --> 01:12:54,953
Good morning, Sr. Galindo.

1034
01:12:55,073 --> 01:13:00,351
Good morning, Miss Vicenta.
You're a sight for sore eyes!

1035
01:13:01,282 --> 01:13:06,086
- How much will you deposit today?
- Today, I'm collecting.

1036
01:13:06,161 --> 01:13:08,297
- To collect?
- 400.000.

1037
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:12,577
- Beg your pardon?
- I finally decided to buy the apartment.

1038
01:13:15,578 --> 01:13:18,613
Will you spend that money
on an apartment!

1039
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:23,322
A few bricks, some cement,
three partitions, and a 20 year mortgage?

1040
01:13:23,397 --> 01:13:27,423
- What a nice terrace!
- You were living so well on the farm!

1041
01:13:27,498 --> 01:13:29,842
I'm buying it. It's a whim.

1042
01:13:29,917 --> 01:13:33,677
- This signature is not valid.
- You're always joking.

1043
01:13:34,258 --> 01:13:37,803
- The T is slightly different.
- That's my handwriting.

1044
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:40,778
The signature that we have registered
has a different style.

1045
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:43,913
What are you talking about?
I want my money.

1046
01:13:44,014 --> 01:13:47,827
What about the bank's responsibility?
We're the trustee of our clients' trust.

1047
01:13:47,937 --> 01:13:50,192
Who assures me that you signed
this check?

1048
01:13:50,267 --> 01:13:51,755
- Me.
- And who are you?

1049
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:54,277
- It's me, Mr. Galindo.
- No, no, no...

1050
01:13:54,397 --> 01:13:59,500
Go home, make another check and
when you have the right T, come back.

1051
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,342
- Will I get here in time?
- You will...

1052
01:14:01,417 --> 01:14:03,840
If not, tomorrow
or the day after or next month.

1053
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:05,974
There are many apartments for sale!

1054
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:14,054
That was impressive,
this is how our money is defended!

1055
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:28,256
No, I can't come now...
Are you in pain?

1056
01:14:28,809 --> 01:14:31,213
Hang in there...
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade!

1057
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,857
Hold on until at 15:30.

1058
01:14:34,916 --> 01:14:37,398
- Martínez.
- Yes, Don Pruden.

1059
01:14:37,518 --> 01:14:39,767
- I mean, Mr. Director.
- Tell Mr. Benítez to come upstairs.

1060
01:14:39,887 --> 01:14:42,126
- Yes, sir.
- And have those doorbells fixed.

1061
01:14:42,246 --> 01:14:44,695
Tomorrow...
What a day today!

1062
01:14:45,285 --> 01:14:48,190
- A form, please.
- A deposit or a withdrawal?

1063
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:50,107
- Deposit.
- Oh, fine.

1064
01:14:50,227 --> 01:14:52,277
- Here. That counter.
- Thank you.

1065
01:14:52,797 --> 01:14:54,247
When will you pay me the check?!

1066
01:14:54,397 --> 01:14:56,149
- I've been here for two hours.
- This is a disgrace!

1067
01:14:56,269 --> 01:14:59,242
They are checking the signatures,
there are only a few of us.

1068
01:14:59,317 --> 01:15:00,997
Hurry up then.

1069
01:15:02,042 --> 01:15:04,774
- Number 63.
- Thank goodness.

1070
01:15:05,397 --> 01:15:08,277
90.000, right?
No funds, sir.

1071
01:15:08,770 --> 01:15:10,055
- No funds?
- Not at all.

1072
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:12,984
- Then why make me wait for two hours?
- Make a claim to the head office.

1073
01:15:13,104 --> 01:15:15,495
Of course I will!

1074
01:15:15,615 --> 01:15:18,285
Do you know how many advances
you have already collected?

1075
01:15:18,405 --> 01:15:20,947
- Oh, many.
- This is a robbery!

1076
01:15:21,067 --> 01:15:26,062
As long as I'm here,
no one will rob a cent from this bank!

1077
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:29,247
- Do you know what I'm going to do?
- No, sir.

1078
01:15:29,397 --> 01:15:32,247
Until you have paid off the debt,
with its corresponding interest,

1079
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:35,297
you will continue working
without being paid.

1080
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:38,597
- Oh well, just that...
- Not only that!

1081
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:42,249
We will provide you with life insurance
in favor of the bank

1082
01:15:42,324 --> 01:15:46,642
in case you die before final repayment,
which will be the most likely.

1083
01:15:46,926 --> 01:15:48,626
Number 64.

1084
01:15:50,126 --> 01:15:51,928
- The stamp.
- What stamp?

1085
01:15:52,003 --> 01:15:53,682
Don't you know about the stamp?

1086
01:15:53,757 --> 01:15:56,966
- Never.
- What if an inspector comes?

1087
01:15:57,463 --> 01:16:00,984
- Where do I find a stamp now?
- Go to the shop.

1088
01:16:01,547 --> 01:16:03,888
- Number 65.
- Me.

1089
01:16:03,963 --> 01:16:06,477
Morning.
What a state you're in today.

1090
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:11,744
- Do you want a cigarette?
- Everybody withdrawing and wasting money!

1091
01:16:11,819 --> 01:16:14,755
You should make a deposit,
savings must be encouraged.

1092
01:16:14,830 --> 01:16:18,430
Saving means security in your old age.
120 pesetas.

1093
01:16:20,397 --> 01:16:22,040
Thank you.

1094
01:16:25,051 --> 01:16:27,236
- Good morning, miss.
- Good morning.

1095
01:16:54,786 --> 01:16:56,747
- Good morning, Mr. Galindo.
- Hello, Bermejillo.

1096
01:16:56,867 --> 01:16:59,897
Martínez, tell Don Prudencio.
Quick.

1097
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,857
- 20 million, right?
- Right.

1098
01:17:07,758 --> 01:17:10,009
Don Prudencio,
the money is here.

1099
01:17:11,999 --> 01:17:15,705
Do you know that 20 million is very manageable?
All you need is two bags.

1100
01:17:24,698 --> 01:17:29,485
What a beauty.
Becoming a millionaire is exciting.

1101
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:35,430
We're getting off on the right foot.

1102
01:17:36,892 --> 01:17:38,928
We'll see how it ends.

1103
01:17:45,834 --> 01:17:49,305
Don Prudencio, sign here,
here and here and on the back.

1104
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:56,897
- Too early!
- He's having the attack!

1105
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,247
- What attack?
- Appendicitis.

1106
01:17:59,367 --> 01:18:01,616
- Didn't they remove his appendix?
- Maybe it's grown again.

1107
01:18:01,736 --> 01:18:05,101
- Get the coats!
- We're going to the hospital!

1108
01:18:05,178 --> 01:18:08,377
Let him have surgery if he needs to,
but you come back ASAP!

1109
01:18:09,997 --> 01:18:12,348
What bad timing!

1110
01:18:12,693 --> 01:18:14,583
- This goes to the vault.
- The vault?

1111
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:16,738
- Yes, keep it in the vault.
- Don't we count it?

1112
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,947
It's your responsibility,
Mr. Director.

1113
01:18:19,067 --> 01:18:21,631
- What if something is missing?
- Well, count it.

1114
01:18:21,751 --> 01:18:23,104
Let's count it.

1115
01:18:23,179 --> 01:18:26,496
- Wake up, Martínez!
- It's over.

1116
01:18:26,616 --> 01:18:28,955
Is it a boy or a girl?

1117
01:18:29,625 --> 01:18:32,142
Where are the 20 million?!
Did the stick-up go well?

1118
01:18:32,217 --> 01:18:33,697
Run, Castrillo!

1119
01:18:36,382 --> 01:18:39,140
10.360.000.

1120
01:18:41,402 --> 01:18:45,179
I count 9.540.000.

1121
01:18:45,684 --> 01:18:48,384
- Impossible. Something is missing.
- That's what I say.

1122
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,489
We have to count again.

1123
01:18:56,751 --> 01:18:58,298
5, 10, 15, 20...

1124
01:18:58,373 --> 01:19:00,078
25, 30, 35...

1125
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:04,277
40, 45... 50, 55...

1126
01:19:04,397 --> 01:19:06,612
Wait a moment!
Not so fast!

1127
01:19:06,732 --> 01:19:09,097
- We have to start over.
- Well let's do it!

1128
01:19:09,217 --> 01:19:12,538
Calm! Calm! Easy!
Let's see...

1129
01:19:15,849 --> 01:19:17,713
- 1000.
- 500.

1130
01:19:17,946 --> 01:19:19,646
- 2000.
- 500.

1131
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,175
- 3000.
- 500.

1132
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:22,492
- 4000.
- 500.

1133
01:19:22,567 --> 01:19:23,722
- 5000.
- 500.

1134
01:19:23,797 --> 01:19:25,977
- Good morning.
- 6000.

1135
01:19:26,371 --> 01:19:30,383
- Bad timing again.
- Good morning, Don Felipe.

1136
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:34,266
- What's this?
- 20 million.

1137
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:36,395
It's a pleasure working like this.

1138
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:39,273
The bank is thriving
since I'm not here anymore.

1139
01:19:39,373 --> 01:19:41,303
Galindo, son!

1140
01:19:41,378 --> 01:19:44,750
Nice to see you.
I couldn't say good bye...

1141
01:19:44,825 --> 01:19:47,540
- Mr. Director...
- Ex-Director.

1142
01:19:47,615 --> 01:19:49,441
Good morning.
What brings you here?

1143
01:19:49,516 --> 01:19:52,496
I forgot my calendar,
I have so many notes on it...

1144
01:19:52,571 --> 01:19:54,855
It has to be today?
We are very busy.

1145
01:19:54,975 --> 01:19:58,924
It doesn't matter, I'll wait.
There's no hurry, I have nothing to do.

1146
01:19:58,999 --> 01:20:03,479
OK, let's go to my office,
take whatever you need, but quickly.

1147
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,780
Keep counting.

1148
01:20:06,299 --> 01:20:08,175
- 9.000.
- 500.

1149
01:20:08,295 --> 01:20:09,725
- 10.000.
- 500.

1150
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,179
- 11.000.
- 500.

1151
01:20:11,279 --> 01:20:12,493
- Pesetas.
- 12.000.

1152
01:20:12,593 --> 01:20:13,722
13.000.

1153
01:20:13,797 --> 01:20:16,322
- If he stays, we're lost!
- 14.000.

1154
01:20:16,397 --> 01:20:18,547
- They'll be here any minute.
- 500.

1155
01:20:18,667 --> 01:20:20,280
- Pesetas.
- 15.000.

1156
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,860
- 500.
- Pesetas.

1157
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:37,977
We have to synchronize our watches.
What time do you have?

1158
01:20:38,097 --> 01:20:39,741
- 14:30.
- 14:50.

1159
01:20:39,816 --> 01:20:42,209
- 14:20.
- We've gotten off on the wrong foot!

1160
01:20:47,463 --> 01:20:50,702
- Could you tell me what time it is?
- 14:45.

1161
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:52,522
Thank you.

1162
01:21:00,097 --> 01:21:02,036
14:45.

1163
01:21:06,648 --> 01:21:09,182
We're short of time, let's go.

1164
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:18,910
- Are you sure you're doing it right?
- Don't know.

1165
01:21:21,531 --> 01:21:24,382
- This is getting ugly. I'm off!
- You stay.

1166
01:21:24,502 --> 01:21:27,890
We have to start this car now.
Come on.

1167
01:21:33,162 --> 01:21:34,881
What?

1168
01:21:36,550 --> 01:21:38,250
What's wrong?

1169
01:21:42,210 --> 01:21:45,812
- Don Felipe won't leave!
- How much do you think this is?

1170
01:21:46,162 --> 01:21:49,187
- About one million.
- That's great, I get three like this.

1171
01:21:49,307 --> 01:21:51,547
Don't touch it, fool!

1172
01:21:51,917 --> 01:21:55,521
- Sure you haven't forgotten anything?
- I'm sure.

1173
01:21:55,641 --> 01:21:58,042
I have a great memory.

1174
01:21:58,162 --> 01:22:00,395
- He's leaving!
- Let's pretend.

1175
01:22:00,515 --> 01:22:02,890
- 777.000.
- 500.

1176
01:22:03,097 --> 01:22:04,977
- Pesetas.
- 778.000.

1177
01:22:05,055 --> 01:22:08,997
- My hat! I almost forgot my hat!
- 779.000.

1178
01:22:09,097 --> 01:22:10,977
He won't leave!

1179
01:22:11,705 --> 01:22:13,521
- 780.000.
- 500.

1180
01:22:13,764 --> 01:22:15,870
- Pesetas.
- 781.000.

1181
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,582
- 500.
- Pesetas.

1182
01:22:17,657 --> 01:22:20,036
- 782.000.
- 500.

1183
01:22:25,298 --> 01:22:27,818
Good morning.
I know it's a bit late...

1184
01:22:27,938 --> 01:22:31,119
but I'd like to to cash
this little check.

1185
01:22:31,239 --> 01:22:35,065
Yes, father.
Quickly, we have to close.

1186
01:22:37,491 --> 01:22:39,706
- Very kind.
- Number 65.

1187
01:22:45,443 --> 01:22:47,657
- Number 65.
- Here.

1188
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:50,657
Alms from a charitable soul.

1189
01:22:50,987 --> 01:22:55,406
There are still
good people in the world.

1190
01:22:55,948 --> 01:23:00,739
Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

1191
01:23:00,859 --> 01:23:04,235
- Do you want everything
in large bills, father? - I do, son.

1192
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:08,355
- I'm missing a thousand!
- This money will bring a little happiness

1193
01:23:08,430 --> 01:23:11,411
to those children who have
no other help than this.

1194
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,986
Little angels...
Here, father.

1195
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:18,639
Oh, it's so late! If you don't mind,
I'm going to make a call.

1196
01:23:18,759 --> 01:23:20,681
- OK, I'm going to...
- Bye.

1197
01:23:20,801 --> 01:23:23,022
- How are you doing?
- Good...

1198
01:23:23,097 --> 01:23:26,997
We are missing 3 or 4 million,
but we'll have them in a moment.

1199
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:39,347
I could have sworn that I dialed
the right number.

1200
01:23:43,079 --> 01:23:45,443
- Why aren't they coming?
- Hush.

1201
01:23:47,409 --> 01:23:50,389
Bad if they don't come,
and if they do, that's even worse.

1202
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:54,671
Hello, Fermina?
What are you saying about Cuenca?

1203
01:23:54,963 --> 01:23:58,807
No, I'm asking for my maid.

1204
01:23:59,021 --> 01:24:02,089
Her name is Fermina.
Cuenca again?

1205
01:24:02,332 --> 01:24:04,332
The lines are crossed.
Hello?

1206
01:24:41,735 --> 01:24:43,201
- Don't move!
- Nobody moves!

1207
01:24:43,276 --> 01:24:45,069
They're here.
Their acting is superb!

1208
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:46,975
Take the money out!

1209
01:24:49,994 --> 01:24:51,494
Hands up!

1210
01:24:52,402 --> 01:24:54,102
- Come on!
- Yes.

1211
01:24:57,499 --> 01:25:01,210
You know, Mr. Benítez,
I kind of like you better as a robber.

1212
01:25:01,311 --> 01:25:03,111
Give us the money, quick!

1213
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,227
You're a disaster.
You're late and wearing kerchiefs!

1214
01:25:06,441 --> 01:25:08,269
What have you done with the stockings?

1215
01:25:08,344 --> 01:25:10,337
- The money!
- OK, OK...

1216
01:25:11,755 --> 01:25:14,097
If we're lucky
Don Felipe won't even hear.

1217
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,004
Why do you insist
on me speaking with Cuenca?

1218
01:25:20,097 --> 01:25:22,975
It can't be a wrong number,
when I...

1219
01:25:27,812 --> 01:25:29,984
They hung up on me.

1220
01:25:30,722 --> 01:25:33,383
No way!
Are you crazy?

1221
01:25:33,897 --> 01:25:35,758
You got your way, right Galindo?

1222
01:25:35,878 --> 01:25:38,994
As soon as I left...
you start fooling around!

1223
01:25:39,208 --> 01:25:41,331
Thank goodness I'm here!

1224
01:25:41,451 --> 01:25:43,617
Give me that gun, you fool.

1225
01:25:44,373 --> 01:25:48,578
Not me! I'm still!
I'm not putting up any resistance.

1226
01:25:49,921 --> 01:25:51,894
You're not Martínez, are you?

1227
01:25:52,829 --> 01:25:55,107
- Nor Benítez.
- Give them all of it, Galindo! All!

1228
01:25:55,207 --> 01:25:57,237
There's more upstairs!

1229
01:26:18,975 --> 01:26:21,800
Watch out, they're for real!
They're robbing our money!

1230
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,797
Don't move, I'll shoot you!

1231
01:26:48,992 --> 01:26:50,797
The street light.

1232
01:26:52,217 --> 01:26:54,286
Don't move, this is a stick-up!

1233
01:26:58,994 --> 01:27:01,094
They're shooting bullets!

1234
01:27:27,445 --> 01:27:29,435
Don't move, I'll shoot!

1235
01:27:38,477 --> 01:27:41,649
One plus one, two.

1236
01:27:59,867 --> 01:28:02,801
- Where's the money?
- Inside along with him.

1237
01:28:03,836 --> 01:28:08,846
Your fan, friend, slave and servant.

1238
01:28:09,516 --> 01:28:11,570
- Martínez.
- Coming!

1239
01:28:12,613 --> 01:28:14,939
Mine's dealt with, boss!

1240
01:28:15,059 --> 01:28:17,176
- Call the police.
- Yes, sir.

1241
01:28:20,205 --> 01:28:23,793
Yes, it's me.
It's a boy... A boy!

1242
01:28:26,652 --> 01:28:30,769
Huh? Two more girls?
No way...

1243
01:28:30,869 --> 01:28:32,455
<i>BANK BRANCH ROBERY FOILED</i>

1244
01:28:32,555 --> 01:28:35,360
<i>The energetic attitude
of the employees prevent crime.</i>

1245
01:28:35,594 --> 01:28:40,360
The Bank of Tomorrow's Planners

1246
01:28:40,874 --> 01:28:45,640
In the future you will be an example
to imitate, a standard to follow.

an extraordinary payment and

1249
01:28:55,953 --> 01:29:00,526
And you, Mr. Director,
will be nominated for a decoration.

1250
01:29:09,374 --> 01:29:12,026
- Have a nice day.
- Have a nice day, Mr. GM.

1251
01:29:16,422 --> 01:29:18,757
- Have a nice day.
- Have fun.

1252
01:29:18,999 --> 01:29:20,699
Bye.

1253
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:24,875
Now he got us all dirty!

1254
01:29:26,170 --> 01:29:27,841
I have a plan.

1255
01:29:28,626 --> 01:29:32,502
This summer, as soon as
Don Felipe goes to the spa...

1256
01:29:34,393 --> 01:29:38,370
Amateurs.
You're just a bunch of amateurs!
