00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:53,559
Hey, man.

3
00:00:53,561 --> 00:00:55,770
This one here.

4
00:00:56,605 --> 00:00:57,605
You hear that?

5
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,275
Oh shit.

6
00:02:34,703 --> 00:02:35,705
Come on.

7
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:03,230
Oh shit, baby.

8
00:03:10,949 --> 00:03:11,948
Whoa.

9
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,990
What the fuck?

10
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:13,991
What the hell do you want?

11
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:14,950
Don't stop now.

12
00:03:14,952 --> 00:03:15,911
We were just enjoying the show.

13
00:03:18,456 --> 00:03:21,417
You can join in if you want.

14
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:23,835
Wait, what the fuck is this?

15
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:24,836
Knock it off, Joan.

16
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:25,878
We're here for work.

17
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,879
Shut it, Miles.

18
00:03:27,881 --> 00:03:29,632
Well, what's
going on here, huh?

19
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,592
Hey, hurry up.
I'm hungry.

20
00:03:31,594 --> 00:03:33,844
Listen, listen, you guys
are wasting your time.

21
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,346
If this is some sort of
home invasion or something,

22
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,889
I don't have any valuables.

23
00:03:36,891 --> 00:03:39,393
Frank doesn't like it when
people don't pay their debts.

24
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,273
Fuck me.

25
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:45,774
Listen, listen, okay.

26
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:49,402
I told him the other day, I
don't have that kind of cash.

27
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:50,402
I just need a few more days.

28
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:52,572
I'll get it to you tomorrow.

29
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:53,531
I swear to God.

30
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,991
You better or I'm coming back.

31
00:03:55,993 --> 00:03:57,745
Okay, okay, I promise.

32
00:04:02,291 --> 00:04:03,125
See?

33
00:04:04,168 --> 00:04:05,003
Easy.

34
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,464
Fucking bitch.

35
00:04:15,304 --> 00:04:17,055
What the fuck are you doing?

36
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:19,307
I was letting you
handle it your way.

37
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:20,807
I got a 200-pound
man coming at me

38
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:23,644
and you're just standing there
with your dick in your hand?

39
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:25,398
Okay, what do you
wanna do with the broad?

40
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,990
Forget about what
you've seen here.

41
00:04:36,992 --> 00:04:38,911
This never happened.

42
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:40,830
Got it?

43
00:04:41,497 --> 00:04:42,331
Yeah.

44
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,083
Good.

45
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,002
Let her go.

46
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:03,350
I like these.

47
00:05:03,352 --> 00:05:04,187
Nice.

48
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,190
It's okay, it's okay.

49
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:11,776
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

50
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:12,862
Having a little fun.

51
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:14,822
Come on.

52
00:05:15,989 --> 00:05:16,990
You can go.

53
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,956
What's the matter with you?

54
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:26,749
We're here to do a
job and get outta here.

55
00:05:26,751 --> 00:05:27,874
Uh-huh.

56
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:30,043
Or do you wanna wait around
for the cops to show up?

57
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:31,670
No.

58
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,047
Good.

59
00:05:33,049 --> 00:05:34,382
Let's roll.

60
00:05:34,384 --> 00:05:35,218
Fucking cunt.

61
00:05:37,261 --> 00:05:38,677
What?

62
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:40,053
What did you just say?

63
00:05:40,055 --> 00:05:41,515
I said I'm fucking hungry.

64
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:44,852
I heard what you said.

65
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:47,687
You ever have
a threesome, hmm?

66
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:48,562
Those are fun.

67
00:05:48,564 --> 00:05:50,064
Yeah.

68
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,858
I had a threesome
one time, in prison.

69
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,858
Are you serious?

70
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,861
He is.

71
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:56,528
I never had one though.

72
00:05:57,532 --> 00:05:58,363
First time for everything.

73
00:05:58,365 --> 00:05:59,740
Yeah.

74
00:05:59,742 --> 00:06:01,033
Hey, Anson.

75
00:06:01,035 --> 00:06:02,285
We're gonna need a
clean-up crew here.

76
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,287
We got a body.

77
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,332
Yeah, make that two bodies.

78
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:09,836
All right, thanks.

79
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,173
What are you
standing there for?

80
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,009
Let's go.

81
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,386
See you later.

82
00:06:20,388 --> 00:06:21,388
Maybe...

83
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,709
What's up, dog?
What you got?

84
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:55,797
Give me the usual,
a bottle of whiskey.

85
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,258
â™ª â™ª

86
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:14,483
Hey, can I get three
shot glasses, please?

87
00:07:31,835 --> 00:07:33,625
Another job well done.

88
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:35,754
Oh, is that what it was?

89
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,592
What's that supposed to mean?

90
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:45,348
Oh, really?

91
00:07:48,809 --> 00:07:50,562
Hey, where'd she go?

92
00:07:55,984 --> 00:07:57,274
Aw shit.

93
00:07:57,276 --> 00:07:59,026
What's wrong?

94
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:01,112
Joan's ex just showed up.

95
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,697
Yeah, so what?

96
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,824
So, she's
got a hard on for him.

97
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:05,699
This should be good.

98
00:08:05,701 --> 00:08:06,492
Oh shit.

99
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,223
Just
give me one moment.

100
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,143
Long time, no see.

101
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,396
How you been?

102
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:37,067
Good, good, I've been good.

103
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:38,776
You?

104
00:08:39,401 --> 00:08:40,235
Great.

105
00:08:49,536 --> 00:08:51,288
I miss you, Anthony.

106
00:08:59,088 --> 00:09:01,214
I should really get going.

107
00:09:01,216 --> 00:09:02,965
It was nice seeing you.

108
00:09:02,967 --> 00:09:03,843
Anthony.

109
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:11,101
Just like Saint Anthony,
finder of lost things.

110
00:09:13,602 --> 00:09:15,896
I think I've lost something.

111
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:19,608
Can you help me find it?

112
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:23,820
Excuse me.

113
00:09:23,822 --> 00:09:25,446
Is this slut bothering you?

114
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:26,655
Um.

115
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:28,908
We're having a moment here.

116
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,661
He's not interested.

117
00:09:32,122 --> 00:09:33,622
Back off, bitch.

118
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,918
Oh, ooh, I'm scared.

119
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,503
Come on.

120
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:47,970
You should teach your new
girlfriend some manners.

121
00:09:58,647 --> 00:10:00,816
What was that all about?

122
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:03,987
Whoa.

123
00:10:07,699 --> 00:10:09,322
I'm tired.

124
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:11,366
Let's go back to my place.

125
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,243
I can't.

126
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:13,663
I'm with someone.

127
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,293
Bring him.

128
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,837
Hey.

129
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,340
Really Joan?

130
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,013
Come on, let's go.

131
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,056
Come on, let's go.

132
00:11:57,058 --> 00:11:58,265
Get the fuck out.

133
00:11:58,267 --> 00:11:59,893
Hey hey hey,
right there's good.

134
00:12:01,396 --> 00:12:02,271
Frank.

135
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:04,605
Sorry.

136
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:05,482
Please, come in.

137
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:09,820
Take care of them.

138
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,698
Put your clothes on.

139
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,745
Come on.

140
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,960
I'll be in the car.

141
00:12:25,962 --> 00:12:27,255
Like anybody gives a shit.

142
00:12:28,464 --> 00:12:30,340
I see you've been
entertaining again.

143
00:12:31,468 --> 00:12:34,384
Got let off a little
steam now and again.

144
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:36,555
Well, I'm sure you let
off plenty last night.

145
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,307
You gotta be careful.

146
00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:42,352
You don't know what kind
of people are out there.

147
00:12:44,772 --> 00:12:46,480
I am those kind of people.

148
00:12:46,482 --> 00:12:47,357
Remember?

149
00:12:49,944 --> 00:12:51,193
Jesus, Joan.

150
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:52,153
You look like shit.

151
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:53,655
When's the last time you slept?

152
00:12:55,407 --> 00:12:56,492
Couple of days maybe.

153
00:13:01,872 --> 00:13:03,831
I could go for some eggs.

154
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:06,333
My bitch of a wife
has me on a diet

155
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:09,544
and I need eggs and
bacon and more bacon.

156
00:13:12,508 --> 00:13:14,385
You know bacon's
bad for your heart.

157
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,012
Don't you
worry about my heart.

158
00:13:18,014 --> 00:13:19,516
Too old to give a shit anyway.

159
00:13:22,227 --> 00:13:23,977
I have some
leftover taco salad.

160
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,154
You're not old, by the way.

161
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:39,700
Seriously, if I
were a working stiff...

162
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:40,701
God forbid.

163
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,245
No, if I were a working stiff,

164
00:13:42,247 --> 00:13:43,747
I'd be coming up on retirement.

165
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,499
People like
us, we don't retire.

166
00:13:47,501 --> 00:13:48,750
Yeah, well you
keep pulling stunts

167
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:50,001
like the one you
pulled last night,

168
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,547
you'll be lucky
to see retirement.

169
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:55,551
Don't be silly.

170
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:02,056
I'm serious as a
heart attack, Joanie.

171
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,349
If you're not careful,
you're gonna wind up

172
00:14:03,351 --> 00:14:04,352
with a bullet in the
back of your head.

173
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:07,562
Don't worry about me.

174
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,730
I'm faster and tougher
than any dickwad out there.

175
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:11,316
You're not
tougher than a bullet.

176
00:14:12,651 --> 00:14:14,818
He was disrespecting me.

177
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,071
What was I supposed to do?

178
00:14:17,699 --> 00:14:19,322
Well, let's just say
your managerial skill

179
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:21,535
leaves much to be desired.

180
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,167
Frank,

181
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:33,129
you know I would never do
anything to embarrass you.

182
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,089
I've outlived a lot of cocky
youngsters, just like you,

183
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:37,260
because I knew when
to keep my cool.

184
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,847
Well, you keep
eating like that,

185
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:46,100
I'm gonna outlive
you, no problem.

186
00:14:46,102 --> 00:14:47,769
Very fucking funny.

187
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,646
Give me a napkin.

188
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,068
Listen,

189
00:14:54,444 --> 00:14:57,736
my nephew, George, is
gonna be joining the crew.

190
00:14:57,738 --> 00:14:59,864
I want you to look out for him.

191
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:00,949
And watch your temper.

192
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,784
If you don't change your ways,

193
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,912
you're gonna be looking
at an early retirement,

194
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:07,165
if you know what I mean.

195
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,752
Yeah, sorry, right.

196
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:14,171
All right, good.

197
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:17,923
Check in with Anson.

198
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:18,926
He's got an important
job for you.

199
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:22,552
Meanwhile, I gotta go
take care of the mess

200
00:15:22,554 --> 00:15:23,473
you made last night.

201
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:50,914
Oh.

202
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,917
Can I help you?

203
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,836
No, I don't think you can.

204
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:56,839
Oh, just,

205
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,133
where do you think you're going?

206
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:01,967
Where do you think I'm going?

207
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:02,802
Up there.

208
00:16:02,804 --> 00:16:04,054
Oh, okay.

209
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,389
I'm afraid we haven't
been properly introduced.

210
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:08,682
My name is George.

211
00:16:08,684 --> 00:16:09,935
I run things around here.

212
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,025
That's funny.

213
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,571
Now get outta my face.

214
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:22,406
Whoa.

215
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:25,825
I don't think you understand.

216
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:27,701
My uncle owns this company.

217
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,997
And, by extension, me.

218
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,916
You work for him, you
work for me, sweetheart.

219
00:16:33,918 --> 00:16:34,878
You got that?

220
00:16:37,338 --> 00:16:38,921
You don't run shit.

221
00:16:38,923 --> 00:16:40,214
You might be Frank's nephew,

222
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,716
but you're just
another dumbass kid.

223
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,510
So, get your head out of your
ass and get outta my face.

224
00:16:45,512 --> 00:16:46,680
Joan.

225
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,722
What?

226
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:50,932
You gonna let her
talk to me like this?

227
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:52,102
Anson wants to see you.

228
00:17:03,073 --> 00:17:05,282
Be sure to wash and wax it.

229
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:10,036
I see you met Joan.

230
00:17:10,038 --> 00:17:11,788
Yeah yeah yeah, she's feisty.

231
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,122
I really like that.

232
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:14,749
I'd stay out of her face.

233
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,166
She bites.

234
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:17,042
Yeah, me too.

235
00:17:17,044 --> 00:17:18,586
Hey do me a favor.

236
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:19,836
Take this to the dry
cleaners, get the blood out,

237
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:20,922
have 'em back to
me tomorrow, okay?

238
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,507
Appreciate that.

239
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:24,886
What the fuck is
going on around here?

240
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:28,304
Who is this guy?

241
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:29,931
You gotta put up with him.

242
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:32,849
He's the boss-man's nephew.

243
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,352
Hey, George.

244
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,228
It was just a joke, buddy.

245
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,269
Hey, George, come back here.

246
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:37,272
Yo.

247
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:42,402
Doesn't match now.

248
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:45,946
This doesn't make any sense.

249
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:47,615
Hey, Joan.

250
00:17:47,617 --> 00:17:49,032
How's it going?

251
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:49,991
Can't complain.

252
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,123
Never-ending
paperwork.

253
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:58,334
It's not easy being a
woman in a man's world.

254
00:17:58,336 --> 00:18:00,171
Ain't that the truth?

255
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,381
Will you give us
some privacy, Donna?

256
00:18:03,465 --> 00:18:04,466
Yes, sir.

257
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:13,016
And get
your feet off my desk.

258
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:19,521
And what can
I do for you today,

259
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:22,316
oh great Mr. Anson, sir?

260
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:23,942
Cut the crap.

261
00:18:23,944 --> 00:18:25,361
I got a dead employee.

262
00:18:25,363 --> 00:18:26,364
That's what's up.

263
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:29,156
So?

264
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:31,075
Can't you just do
the usual casserole?

265
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,368
The usual casserole?

266
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,872
What's that supposed to mean?

267
00:18:36,707 --> 00:18:38,834
What am I gonna tell
this kid's family, huh?

268
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:43,171
You can tell them
that their star athlete

269
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:45,008
tried to kill me
with a baseball bat.

270
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,759
It was self-defense.

271
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:51,261
Self-defense or not, don't
you ever do that again.

272
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,015
You hear me?

273
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:57,059
Look, man, you got a problem?

274
00:18:57,061 --> 00:18:58,646
Talk to Frank.

275
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:02,856
You watch yourself.

276
00:19:02,858 --> 00:19:04,985
Frank can only do so much.

277
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,867
Now, got something
for you to do.

278
00:19:13,036 --> 00:19:15,661
Frank has asked you to
personally take care of this.

279
00:19:15,663 --> 00:19:18,247
Some asshole with a conscience

280
00:19:18,249 --> 00:19:20,001
is causing trouble
for us downtown.

281
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,211
I get it.

282
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:25,962
A few punches, a
little bit of blood,

283
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:28,385
and everyone gets the message.

284
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,554
Anthony?

285
00:19:33,556 --> 00:19:36,682
Social worker at the
Downtown Youth Shelter.

286
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,727
He got the bright idea to
step out of the shelter

287
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,395
and onto the streets,

288
00:19:41,397 --> 00:19:43,732
trying to help these kids
clean their lives up.

289
00:19:45,068 --> 00:19:47,694
Well, it means a drop
in demand for us.

290
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,570
You need to go and
send a message.

291
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:54,743
Are you deaf?

292
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:58,373
No.

293
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:01,332
No, I got this.

294
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:04,126
I sent the boys out
on a different job.

295
00:20:04,128 --> 00:20:06,128
You'll handle this one yourself.

296
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,005
Got it?

297
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:16,765
Donna, get back in here.

298
00:21:16,533 --> 00:21:17,534
Shit.

299
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,242
Hey, babe.

300
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:20,537
Did you miss me?

301
00:21:22,331 --> 00:21:25,334
Sorry about last night.

302
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:44,521
That's not why I'm here.

303
00:21:49,149 --> 00:21:50,691
You've been making some problems

304
00:21:50,693 --> 00:21:53,363
for some very important people.

305
00:21:54,489 --> 00:21:56,241
What are you talking about?

306
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,742
You know what this is about.

307
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:01,661
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:01,663 --> 00:22:02,664
I don't.

309
00:22:05,082 --> 00:22:06,959
These are our best customers.

310
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:11,546
You get in the way
of our business,

311
00:22:11,548 --> 00:22:12,838
we'll get in the way of yours.

312
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,508
Is this about
the youth shelter?

313
00:22:19,931 --> 00:22:21,766
You don't look so good.

314
00:22:23,518 --> 00:22:24,642
Why don't you calm down.

315
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,102
Let's go get some fresh air.

316
00:22:26,104 --> 00:22:28,895
Why are you always trying
to shove me down, huh?

317
00:22:28,897 --> 00:22:30,357
I'm not a little girl anymore.

318
00:22:39,075 --> 00:22:40,285
Fuck.

319
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:41,951
I can't do this.

320
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,744
What's gotten into you?

321
00:22:43,746 --> 00:22:44,747
Are you on something?

322
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,748
Get the hell outta here.

323
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,249
Now.

324
00:22:48,251 --> 00:22:49,293
Go.

325
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,227
Hey, guys.

326
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:49,896
What's up?

327
00:23:50,146 --> 00:23:50,936
I don't wanna go out to...

328
00:23:53,607 --> 00:23:54,816
Shut your fucking mouth.

329
00:23:54,818 --> 00:23:55,732
What the
fuck was that for?

330
00:23:55,734 --> 00:23:57,652
I said
shut your mouth.

331
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:01,530
Oh, that's a good one.

332
00:24:01,532 --> 00:24:02,533
A little fight, huh?

333
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:03,657
Back up.

334
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,117
Don't make me shoot you.

335
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,663
Oh, oh.

336
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:09,999
Whoo!

337
00:24:11,417 --> 00:24:13,375
See what happens to
your fucking gun, huh?

338
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:14,919
This is
what happens, huh?

339
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,003
You know, Joan, I used to
think you were a hot chick.

340
00:24:17,005 --> 00:24:18,213
Yeah.

341
00:24:18,215 --> 00:24:19,550
That was until
I got to know you,

342
00:24:21,176 --> 00:24:22,177
you know?

343
00:24:22,386 --> 00:24:24,178
You know, maybe if you
were like a team player,

344
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,054
which you're not.

345
00:24:25,056 --> 00:24:25,846
Yeah.

346
00:24:25,848 --> 00:24:27,097
We got your back

347
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,641
and your always running
your fucking mouth.

348
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:29,642
Where you going,
where you going?

349
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:32,436
Where you going?

350
00:24:34,107 --> 00:24:35,021
Oh.

351
00:24:35,023 --> 00:24:35,772
Yes!

352
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,567
I fucking got her.

353
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:41,153
Where you going?

354
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:43,741
No one's home, honey.

355
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:46,701
Where you going, huh?

356
00:24:46,703 --> 00:24:47,826
Hey, don't kill her yet.

357
00:24:47,828 --> 00:24:48,827
Don't kill her yet.

358
00:24:48,829 --> 00:24:50,454
Let's have some fun, right?

359
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,913
If she tries to
run, you shoot her.

360
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:53,207
Okay, relax.

361
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,084
- Don't fucking run.
- Come on, let's go, let's go.

362
00:24:55,086 --> 00:24:57,336
Oh!

363
00:24:57,338 --> 00:24:59,505
That lady got balls.

364
00:24:59,507 --> 00:25:00,383
Whoo!

365
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:03,384
Ah, fuck.

366
00:25:03,386 --> 00:25:04,134
What the fuck?

367
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:06,389
Hey, where's your
fucking knife now?

368
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:09,057
Yeah.

369
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:10,892
You better not run, though.

370
00:25:10,894 --> 00:25:11,601
Let's just kill
her man, come on.

371
00:25:11,603 --> 00:25:12,643
Stop!

372
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:13,810
Wait, what's Frank gonna think

373
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,020
once Frank's heard about this?

374
00:25:15,022 --> 00:25:16,314
We're gonna tell him
that you got killed

375
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:17,147
by a rival gang.

376
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,982
It happens all the time.

377
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,402
- Fuck you.
- Oh.

378
00:25:21,404 --> 00:25:23,070
Fuck all of you.

379
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:23,904
I won't forget this.

380
00:25:23,906 --> 00:25:25,114
What are you gonna do?

381
00:25:25,116 --> 00:25:26,656
You gonna scratch
out our eyes, huh,

382
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:29,743
with your empty promises,
your empty threats, huh?

383
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:31,953
Why couldn't you
just shut your mouth

384
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:33,789
and take your cut?

385
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:34,582
You know what?

386
00:25:34,584 --> 00:25:36,124
Shut your fucking mouth, okay?

387
00:25:36,126 --> 00:25:38,752
Because you would order
us around with your jokes

388
00:25:38,754 --> 00:25:40,837
and your empty threats, but
you know how to do your job?

389
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,632
Me, not you, all right?

390
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:45,343
Now, I do the job
and I get the glory.

391
00:25:45,345 --> 00:25:46,885
Yeah.

392
00:25:46,887 --> 00:25:49,346
Wait, stop stop, please.

393
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:51,432
Please, I got money.

394
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:54,354
I got about $30,000

395
00:25:55,646 --> 00:25:56,772
in a box under my bed.

396
00:25:57,857 --> 00:25:59,147
If you let me go,
it's all yours.

397
00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:00,107
We all got money.

398
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:00,817
Yeah, we all got money.

399
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:01,608
Just walk away.

400
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,859
You know what?

401
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:04,153
Let me shoot her, come on.

402
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,238
I don't think I will,
but thanks for that tip.

403
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,489
Miles,
please don't do this.

404
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:08,156
Oh!

405
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:09,241
Fucking bitch.

406
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:10,785
You gonna help me with this?

407
00:26:10,787 --> 00:26:11,868
Goddamn, yes.

408
00:26:17,126 --> 00:26:18,127
Fucking bitch.

409
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:27,634
All right, Miles,
Miles, enough, man.

410
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:28,803
Come on, let's get
the fuck outta here.

411
00:26:28,805 --> 00:26:29,846
Yeah, she thought
she was better than us.

412
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,847
Fucking bitch is.

413
00:26:34,144 --> 00:26:34,976
Whoo!

414
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:36,477
I gotta start doing more cardio.

415
00:26:38,188 --> 00:26:39,148
Fucking feel alive.

416
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:43,610
Whoo!

417
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,989
Let's go, bitch tits.

418
00:26:47,991 --> 00:26:49,158
- Come on.
- Let's go.

419
00:26:55,498 --> 00:26:58,668
I haven't
shot up for weeks.

420
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:02,920
What about your dad?

421
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:03,962
Did you speak to him?

422
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:05,173
Fuck that asshole.

423
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:08,009
Always going on and on
about the old country

424
00:27:08,011 --> 00:27:11,095
and how he used to be and
he wasn't even born there.

425
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:13,013
Well, but he is your father.

426
00:27:13,015 --> 00:27:15,098
No, not
according to him.

427
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,184
Ah, you shouldn't
take personally

428
00:27:17,186 --> 00:27:20,771
things that are said in the
heat of the moment, right?

429
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:25,403
Anthony, can I talk
to you for a moment?

430
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:29,113
Um, sure.

431
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:31,201
Guys, would you excuse
me for a moment?

432
00:27:42,212 --> 00:27:43,588
Cheryl, what's wrong?

433
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,798
Do you remember that girl
you used to date, Joan?

434
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,549
I just saw her yesterday.

435
00:27:49,551 --> 00:27:50,759
Why?

436
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:52,886
You wanna tell me
what's really going on?

437
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:53,721
What do you mean?

438
00:27:53,723 --> 00:27:55,056
She came here the other day,

439
00:27:55,058 --> 00:27:56,059
was looking for you.

440
00:27:57,894 --> 00:27:58,643
It's fine.

441
00:27:58,645 --> 00:27:59,894
Don't worry about it.

442
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,980
It's really nothing for
you to get upset about.

443
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,981
I don't want her
hanging around here.

444
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:06,442
I don't like her.

445
00:28:06,444 --> 00:28:07,984
I know all about the
people she hangs out with,

446
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,028
all about the things she does.

447
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,405
I don't want her
around this house.

448
00:28:11,407 --> 00:28:13,281
This is a safe zone.

449
00:28:13,283 --> 00:28:15,992
So, next time you see
her, tell her to stay away

450
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,619
or I will.

451
00:28:17,621 --> 00:28:19,454
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:28:19,456 --> 00:28:20,914
Good.

453
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,167
Now get back to work.

454
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,231
Who's there?

455
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,111
What, what's wrong?

456
00:30:13,113 --> 00:30:14,778
Well, I
thought I saw something.

457
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,821
Aw, you're dreaming.

458
00:30:15,823 --> 00:30:17,615
Go back to sleep, honey.

459
00:30:17,617 --> 00:30:19,077
I saw something.

460
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,038
Hey, get out of here.

461
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,207
Sorry.

462
00:30:26,209 --> 00:30:29,376
What are you doing?

463
00:30:29,378 --> 00:30:30,795
What was that?

464
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,505
There was a
strange woman in the corner.

465
00:30:32,507 --> 00:30:33,338
Come on.

466
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:44,352
Joan, what are you doing here?

467
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:47,813
Leave the light off, please.

468
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:54,736
Can't keep doing this.

469
00:30:54,738 --> 00:30:56,028
You have to let it go.

470
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,531
Now you're breaking
into my place.

471
00:31:00,284 --> 00:31:03,411
You know those guys I
used to hang out with?

472
00:31:03,413 --> 00:31:04,746
Of course.

473
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,458
They're the bane
of my existence.

474
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:12,464
I'm gonna get them and
I need you to help me.

475
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:16,339
What am I gonna do?

476
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:18,261
You're the only
one that I can trust.

477
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:23,099
I need to make them pay
for what they've done.

478
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:25,477
What have they done?

479
00:31:31,066 --> 00:31:34,110
They jumped me
outside of my apartment.

480
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:36,193
Oh my god.

481
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,069
Are you okay?

482
00:31:37,071 --> 00:31:38,320
Let me take you to a hospital,

483
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:39,948
let the cops take care of this.

484
00:31:41,117 --> 00:31:42,284
The cops?

485
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:44,788
What are they gonna do?

486
00:31:45,621 --> 00:31:47,038
I'll take you to a hospital,

487
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,792
but I'm not gonna help you
with some ridiculous vendetta.

488
00:31:52,462 --> 00:31:53,463
Very well.

489
00:31:54,463 --> 00:31:57,050
You won't join me, then
I'll do it on my own.

490
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:08,144
You're going to see what a
woman's wrath looks like.

491
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,026
Joan, you need to stop this.

492
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,494
I have to
congratulate you, Miles.

493
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:30,248
Revenues been up since
you took over the crew.

494
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:31,835
Up by 12.5%.

495
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,169
That's what happens when
you put a man in charge.

496
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:37,215
Yeah, makin'
a real killin' now.

497
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,339
What's that supposed to mean?

498
00:32:39,341 --> 00:32:40,508
Cool your jets, asshole.

499
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,509
You got something
you wanna fuckin' say?

500
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:43,176
Relax, dude.

501
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:44,470
It's a joke, okay?

502
00:32:44,472 --> 00:32:45,387
It's nothing.

503
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:48,057
Hey, we all know
whose dick is bigger.

504
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:49,767
Let's get our work done.

505
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:51,018
That's right, bitch tits.

506
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,020
Get out there and do
your fucking jobs.

507
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,942
Listen man, keep your
fucking mouth shut.

508
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,195
Anthony.

509
00:33:02,197 --> 00:33:03,198
Anthony, it's me.

510
00:33:04,032 --> 00:33:05,117
You're following me now?

511
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:08,243
Hey, did I come
over last night?

512
00:33:08,245 --> 00:33:10,706
Do you remember me coming by?

513
00:33:13,501 --> 00:33:15,209
What?

514
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:18,213
Look, something
strange is happening.

515
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:25,135
Listen, you need to stay
away from me, all right?

516
00:33:25,137 --> 00:33:26,386
Don't talk to me.

517
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:28,388
I can't deal with this.

518
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,725
Just go away.

519
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,442
Oh, and one more thing.

520
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,706
I need to talk to you.

521
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:55,333
I can't.

522
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:57,042
I don't wanna get involved.

523
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:59,336
You're the only
person I can turn to.

524
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:00,253
Really?

525
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:01,756
Don't you have anyone else,

526
00:34:01,758 --> 00:34:02,759
your friends?

527
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,346
My friends took a
crowbar to my skull.

528
00:34:09,932 --> 00:34:11,598
I'm sorry, I can't.

529
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:15,852
Let me go.

530
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:17,104
I'm not doing anything.

531
00:34:17,106 --> 00:34:19,857
Hey, you wanna work my
streets, you gotta pay the rent.

532
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:22,109
Stop wriggling
around, you bitch.

533
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:23,778
Let me go.

534
00:34:24,823 --> 00:34:26,071
Now shut your fucking mouth.

535
00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:27,115
You talk when I
tell you to talk.

536
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:28,448
Rose?

537
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,283
Hey, this ain't none
of your concern, retard.

538
00:34:29,285 --> 00:34:30,158
Who the fuck are you?

539
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,451
I'm not talking to you.

540
00:34:31,453 --> 00:34:33,037
You wanna make
this your business?

541
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:33,870
It's my job.

542
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,372
Oh, are you a cop?

543
00:34:35,374 --> 00:34:37,040
He's my youth counselor.

544
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,125
Oh shit.

545
00:34:38,127 --> 00:34:39,627
You're a counselor.

546
00:34:39,629 --> 00:34:41,087
Well, mister counselor, one
of your little charges here

547
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:42,671
has been working my
streets without a permit.

548
00:34:42,673 --> 00:34:43,631
Very big no no.

549
00:34:43,633 --> 00:34:44,549
Bad little girl.

550
00:34:45,301 --> 00:34:46,216
Bad girl.

551
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,093
Let her go.

552
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:48,386
She's just a teenager.

553
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:49,511
Oh, she feels more
like a woman to me.

554
00:34:49,513 --> 00:34:50,470
We got a teenager.

555
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:53,808
You get the fuck back.

556
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,600
You got knocked the fuck out.

557
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:57,854
That what happens, you fuck.

558
00:34:57,856 --> 00:34:58,812
Now, listen here, buddy.

559
00:34:58,814 --> 00:34:59,980
I got no beef with you,

560
00:34:59,982 --> 00:35:01,649
but you keep messin' with us,

561
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:02,691
you're gonna end
up six feet under.

562
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:04,819
Kick his fucking ass, Miles.

563
00:35:04,821 --> 00:35:05,822
Stop it.

564
00:35:06,656 --> 00:35:07,654
You understand okay?

565
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:08,823
Get your hands off him.

566
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,158
What the fuck?

567
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:11,908
Where did you come from?

568
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,828
Get her outta here.

569
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:14,831
What the fuck
are you doing here?

570
00:35:16,665 --> 00:35:17,165
It doesn't matter.

571
00:35:17,167 --> 00:35:18,374
You know what?

572
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:20,250
I'm in charge now. We don't
pussyfoot around anymore.

573
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,674
You always were
easily distracted.

574
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:27,969
Motherfucker!

575
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:37,517
You're gonna have to
try harder than that.

576
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,685
We don't fuck
around here anymore.

577
00:35:38,687 --> 00:35:40,231
Time to bring this bitch down.

578
00:35:44,736 --> 00:35:45,651
Miles, let's get
outta here, man.

579
00:35:45,653 --> 00:35:46,863
This shit ain't right.

580
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,370
What was that?

581
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:00,919
We need to get outta here.

582
00:36:10,386 --> 00:36:11,930
Take her back to the shelter.

583
00:36:13,097 --> 00:36:13,888
I'll be all right.

584
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,100
I'm not leaving you here.

585
00:36:18,144 --> 00:36:21,022
I know a place
where it's safe.

586
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,336
I used to come here when
my parents would fight.

587
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,593
Back before I
was at the shelter.

588
00:37:03,356 --> 00:37:04,607
God.

589
00:37:10,488 --> 00:37:11,448
You all right?

590
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:15,534
I don't think so.

591
00:37:19,497 --> 00:37:22,709
How did you, um, do that

592
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:25,837
thing with the shadows?

593
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:29,048
Just seems like
it was a part of me.

594
00:37:31,341 --> 00:37:32,551
It was pretty fucking cool.

595
00:37:35,388 --> 00:37:38,013
Did they hurt
you or violate you?

596
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:39,017
Did they?

597
00:37:39,934 --> 00:37:41,350
No.

598
00:37:41,352 --> 00:37:43,185
Those guys wouldn't know
their dicks from a rubber hose.

599
00:37:43,187 --> 00:37:45,354
You sure got a mouth on you.

600
00:37:45,356 --> 00:37:46,566
Ain't that the truth.

601
00:37:51,278 --> 00:37:53,572
Well, I need to get going.

602
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,283
Got prior engagements?

603
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,161
I gotta clean up.

604
00:38:03,207 --> 00:38:04,209
What?

605
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:06,252
Just go.

606
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:09,504
Are you sure you're okay?

607
00:38:09,506 --> 00:38:12,506
You want me to take you
back to the shelter?

608
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:15,010
No, I'd rather stay here.

609
00:38:16,095 --> 00:38:19,223
You sure you're safe with her?

610
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:21,517
I'm not gonna hurt her.

611
00:38:24,187 --> 00:38:26,856
Well, don't let anyone
else get in here, all right?

612
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,877
What do you see in him?

613
00:38:50,713 --> 00:38:54,756
He's cute in a
dorky kind of way.

614
00:38:54,758 --> 00:38:57,094
Besides, girls like me
can't afford to be picky.

615
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,059
What happened to you?

616
00:39:04,352 --> 00:39:05,395
I heard that you got attacked.

617
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:10,480
I don't like to
think about it.

618
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,901
Oh, but
what was it like?

619
00:39:19,075 --> 00:39:20,073
I don't know.

620
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:21,827
I don't remember everything.

621
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:27,165
There was a sharp
pain in my head

622
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:31,629
and suddenly my
whole body went numb

623
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:35,966
and next thing I know,
I woke up in some alley.

624
00:39:37,551 --> 00:39:39,762
It was like you came
back from the dead.

625
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:45,433
God.

626
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:47,604
I wonder what it's
like to be dead.

627
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:51,441
You know, it must
be kind of peaceful.

628
00:39:52,941 --> 00:39:53,943
Peaceful?

629
00:39:55,444 --> 00:39:56,861
It's not peaceful.

630
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:58,615
It's painful.

631
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:04,662
There's something that happened,

632
00:40:06,622 --> 00:40:08,624
something I can't explain.

633
00:40:09,792 --> 00:40:10,794
Just,

634
00:40:12,796 --> 00:40:14,254
just blackness.

635
00:40:23,932 --> 00:40:27,058
Besides, what are you doing,

636
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,642
disrespecting your
body like that

637
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:30,312
just to make a
little bit of money?

638
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:33,272
You should be getting
ready for prom,

639
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:35,443
not sleeping in some
filthy warehouse.

640
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:37,237
It's a long story.

641
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:39,572
You don't wanna hear it.

642
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:42,492
I got all the
time in the world.

643
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:46,120
I guess I could tell you.

644
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:49,287
I don't know.

645
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:51,083
I guess it all started
back in middle school.

646
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:58,383
There was one year at camp,

647
00:41:03,178 --> 00:41:05,932
all the girls used to sneak
into the boy's cabins at night.

648
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:12,271
The usual teenager horny shit.

649
00:41:15,024 --> 00:41:18,191
Anyway, one night we were
hanging out and chatting

650
00:41:18,193 --> 00:41:22,614
and some people
started making out.

651
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,035
And this big kid, Mario,

652
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:30,039
he was probably a
football player,

653
00:41:32,207 --> 00:41:33,959
he comes over and
starts kissing me.

654
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:38,921
And at first I
went along with it,

655
00:41:38,923 --> 00:41:41,383
'cause I liked the attention.

656
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,136
Then he started to
get a little rough

657
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:48,182
and I told him to
stop and he wouldn't.

658
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:55,647
And his friends just
kept cheering him on.

659
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:07,577
I just laid there and
let him do his thing.

660
00:42:09,787 --> 00:42:11,705
I laid there numb.

661
00:42:15,126 --> 00:42:16,919
My mind went elsewhere.

662
00:42:20,423 --> 00:42:22,883
But after that I could feel it,

663
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,763
all of them laughing at
me and calling me a slut

664
00:42:28,765 --> 00:42:30,183
and a whore.

665
00:42:34,144 --> 00:42:35,062
Wow.

666
00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:38,148
Tell me about it.

667
00:42:42,194 --> 00:42:44,113
Now I'm telling you all this.

668
00:42:48,118 --> 00:42:50,453
How did you wind up
sleeping with men for money?

669
00:42:51,787 --> 00:42:55,624
I tried to get a
job, really I did,

670
00:42:57,419 --> 00:43:01,839
but who's gonna hire a
16-year-old homeless kid?

671
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:08,471
Sorry.

672
00:43:12,015 --> 00:43:13,600
I know what it feels like.

673
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:16,020
It gets better.

674
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:18,231
It does.

675
00:43:19,314 --> 00:43:22,318
I left home when I was 17
years old and I made it.

676
00:43:23,653 --> 00:43:24,736
Look at me.

677
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:26,114
You?

678
00:43:29,825 --> 00:43:31,785
And have my friends
leave me for dead.

679
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:35,412
No thanks.

680
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:37,249
Well, there's gotta
be a better way.

681
00:43:39,377 --> 00:43:40,712
I don't know.

682
00:43:43,173 --> 00:43:44,256
I'm just tired.

683
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,102
Thank you

684
00:43:57,771 --> 00:43:58,729
for helping me out.

685
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:04,026
And I do hope that you
get this all figured out.

686
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:06,403
You're welcome.

687
00:44:07,696 --> 00:44:08,655
Goodnight.

688
00:44:09,865 --> 00:44:10,867
Night.

689
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:55,912
Hey.

690
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:57,956
Hi.

691
00:45:02,252 --> 00:45:03,753
Well, I made it home safely,

692
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:05,463
as you can see.

693
00:45:13,095 --> 00:45:13,929
I'm scared.

694
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,515
What's going on?

695
00:45:18,517 --> 00:45:19,519
I don't know.

696
00:45:20,644 --> 00:45:22,271
I wish I did.

697
00:45:28,403 --> 00:45:32,321
Is this it for me,
hanging out in alleyways

698
00:45:32,323 --> 00:45:36,118
and warehouses with
the scum of humanity?

699
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:40,081
They're good kids.

700
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:44,836
Rose seems okay.

701
00:45:48,964 --> 00:45:51,341
What if you had a chance
to make things better?

702
00:45:52,885 --> 00:45:55,095
What if this is what
you were meant to do?

703
00:45:57,473 --> 00:45:58,892
That's depressing.

704
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:03,727
Maybe you were
meant to protect them.

705
00:46:03,729 --> 00:46:05,147
From what?

706
00:46:05,856 --> 00:46:07,397
I can't even protect myself.

707
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:10,651
Wouldn't you have wanted
someone to help you out?

708
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:12,819
It doesn't work like that.

709
00:46:12,821 --> 00:46:13,698
Well, maybe it does.

710
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,578
I like your optimism.

711
00:46:20,997 --> 00:46:21,955
Think about it.

712
00:46:23,082 --> 00:46:25,167
What if you could make
a difference here?

713
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:31,591
Oh.

714
00:46:46,814 --> 00:46:48,439
Thank you, dear.

715
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:49,943
Of course, Frank.

716
00:46:52,361 --> 00:46:54,780
Miles, tell him
what you told me.

717
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,698
It was her, I swear to God.

718
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:00,033
Who?

719
00:47:00,035 --> 00:47:01,787
It was that fucking
barracuda, Joan.

720
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:08,002
I am not happy.

721
00:47:08,877 --> 00:47:10,629
You were supposed
to finish her off.

722
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:14,298
I could've sworn that we did.

723
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,633
Don't worry, Frank.

724
00:47:15,635 --> 00:47:17,384
We'll take care of
this little problem.

725
00:47:17,386 --> 00:47:18,430
I hope that you do.

726
00:47:20,557 --> 00:47:25,392
You wouldn't want to
disappoint me again, would you?

727
00:47:25,394 --> 00:47:26,935
No, Frank, I wouldn't.

728
00:47:26,937 --> 00:47:29,106
Good, get out.

729
00:47:30,399 --> 00:47:32,774
Dirk, stay behind.

730
00:47:32,776 --> 00:47:33,694
We need to talk.

731
00:47:36,573 --> 00:47:37,904
I'm sorry we let you down.

732
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:40,283
Do we trust these
guys to do the job.

733
00:47:40,285 --> 00:47:41,743
Oh, absolutely.

734
00:47:41,745 --> 00:47:42,493
They're my best men.

735
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:46,165
I'm sorry I failed you.

736
00:47:47,207 --> 00:47:50,586
All these years, you
never have until now.

737
00:47:53,423 --> 00:47:54,171
Wait.

738
00:47:54,173 --> 00:47:56,592
Look, you, come on.

739
00:47:57,426 --> 00:47:58,426
It's not gonna happen again.

740
00:47:58,428 --> 00:48:00,011
I'm never gonna fail you again.

741
00:48:00,013 --> 00:48:02,138
I know that you won't.

742
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:08,685
What the...

743
00:48:08,687 --> 00:48:10,687
Miles, you're in charge now.

744
00:48:10,689 --> 00:48:12,439
Take care of the situation.

745
00:48:12,441 --> 00:48:13,443
All right.

746
00:48:16,528 --> 00:48:17,446
Leave it.

747
00:48:20,283 --> 00:48:21,284
Donna.

748
00:48:27,457 --> 00:48:28,458
You work for me now.

749
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:30,376
You understand?

750
00:48:32,294 --> 00:48:33,586
Good.

751
00:48:33,588 --> 00:48:37,173
Now, get a clean-up
crew in here.

752
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:40,053
I'm afraid that Dirk
has made a mess.

753
00:48:48,769 --> 00:48:50,477
All right, bitches,
things are gonna change.

754
00:48:50,479 --> 00:48:51,979
I'm in charge now.

755
00:48:51,981 --> 00:48:54,064
Hey, you notice anything
strange going on around here?

756
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:55,524
No, we all knew this
day was coming, guys.

757
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:57,026
What the hell?

758
00:48:57,028 --> 00:48:58,569
No no no, I'm talking about
Frank is acting differently.

759
00:48:58,571 --> 00:49:00,488
Eh, Frank just
needs to get laid.

760
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:02,823
What the fuck are we gonna
do about this feisty bitch?

761
00:49:02,825 --> 00:49:04,618
I don't know.

762
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:18,173
Hey, working?

763
00:49:19,175 --> 00:49:20,343
Fuck off.

764
00:49:39,111 --> 00:49:40,278
What the fuck?

765
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,111
Nice ride.

766
00:49:41,113 --> 00:49:42,321
Where you taking it?

767
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:46,366
Uh, what?

768
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:47,618
No no no, slow down.

769
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:48,785
What the fuck are
you talking about?

770
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:50,203
Goddamn it.

771
00:49:54,794 --> 00:49:56,294
You.

772
00:50:01,216 --> 00:50:02,174
You too.

773
00:50:02,176 --> 00:50:03,718
God, you motherfuckers.

774
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:04,843
This is what we're
gonna do, okay?

775
00:50:04,845 --> 00:50:06,178
You get back there now.

776
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,973
No, I don't give
a fuck, all right?

777
00:50:08,975 --> 00:50:10,433
Are you telling me what?

778
00:50:10,435 --> 00:50:12,562
I'm gonna knock your fucking
teeth in when I see you.

779
00:50:19,234 --> 00:50:21,486
Shut the fuck up.

780
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:29,160
Your job is very
fucking simple.

781
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:30,453
You get in there you get...

782
00:50:30,455 --> 00:50:31,912
What the fuck you talking about?

783
00:50:31,914 --> 00:50:34,247
It's a girl!
It's a fucking girl, okay?

784
00:50:34,249 --> 00:50:35,792
She's got high-heels on.

785
00:50:35,794 --> 00:50:37,584
I don't fucking know, all right?

786
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,062
She still has such a nice ass.

787
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:55,937
What the fuck, though?

788
00:50:55,939 --> 00:50:58,607
She got, like, shadows and shit.

789
00:51:05,823 --> 00:51:06,782
How did she do that?

790
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:11,118
Maybe she's a fucking ninja.

791
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:28,346
I know how we're
gonna get this bitch.

792
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:40,066
Light it up, boys.

793
00:51:41,984 --> 00:51:43,401
Light it
up, man, we're ready.

794
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,026
Like moths to a flame.

795
00:51:50,827 --> 00:51:52,868
Cheryl, why are you
calling me so late?

796
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,078
There's a
fire at the shelter

797
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,662
and we can't find Dimitri.

798
00:51:55,664 --> 00:51:56,957
I'll be right there.

799
00:52:11,765 --> 00:52:13,680
Dimitri!

800
00:52:22,357 --> 00:52:23,359
Dimitri.

801
00:52:24,778 --> 00:52:25,817
Dimitri, wake up.

802
00:52:25,819 --> 00:52:27,611
Wake up.

803
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,077
God.

804
00:52:45,548 --> 00:52:48,716
You know, I am trying
to stay positive.

805
00:52:48,718 --> 00:52:50,470
I'm trying to be here for them.

806
00:52:51,345 --> 00:52:53,388
You, you just wanna
go after them.

807
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,388
You just wanna kill them.

808
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,555
You just wanna be like them.

809
00:52:55,557 --> 00:52:57,017
You just wanna do all that.

810
00:52:58,727 --> 00:53:01,647
It is not an answer.

811
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:04,316
Violence only begets violence.

812
00:53:05,234 --> 00:53:07,151
This ends tonight.

813
00:53:07,153 --> 00:53:08,238
A kid is dead.

814
00:53:09,321 --> 00:53:10,240
You understand that?

815
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:17,122
You don't, do you?

816
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:22,252
Fine.

817
00:53:23,586 --> 00:53:25,086
Go.

818
00:53:25,088 --> 00:53:27,087
Go, do what you wanna do.

819
00:53:27,089 --> 00:53:28,091
I'm done.

820
00:53:56,535 --> 00:53:57,453
Yeah.

821
00:53:58,537 --> 00:54:01,248
Mmm, ma ma ma ma.

822
00:54:08,423 --> 00:54:10,008
What the fuck?

823
00:54:13,428 --> 00:54:15,930
I paid my fucking bill.

824
00:54:24,897 --> 00:54:26,316
Fucking bullshit.

825
00:54:27,149 --> 00:54:28,276
Hello?

826
00:54:38,118 --> 00:54:40,160
What the fuck?

827
00:54:43,415 --> 00:54:45,165
Ah, you fucking bitch.

828
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,667
What the fuck are
you doing here?

829
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:48,919
You want money, huh?

830
00:54:48,921 --> 00:54:49,879
Fucking take it.

831
00:54:49,881 --> 00:54:51,174
It's under the fucking...

832
00:54:52,091 --> 00:54:53,718
Ah, fuck.

833
00:54:54,426 --> 00:54:55,428
Fuck.

834
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,472
Don't, don't.

835
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:13,363
You thought I was
dead, didn't you?

836
00:55:44,017 --> 00:55:45,269
Good riddance.

837
00:55:53,403 --> 00:55:54,319
Ah.

838
00:56:03,245 --> 00:56:04,370
Yeah?

839
00:56:04,372 --> 00:56:06,330
Whoa, slow down, what?

840
00:56:06,332 --> 00:56:07,790
What?

841
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:09,459
No, you stay right there.
Fuck!

842
00:56:09,461 --> 00:56:11,588
Neal, get in here.

843
00:56:12,921 --> 00:56:13,923
Ah.

844
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:16,339
Yeah?

845
00:56:16,341 --> 00:56:18,091
I need you to get Henry.

846
00:56:18,093 --> 00:56:19,511
You guys are gonna go do something
for me right now, okay?

847
00:56:30,647 --> 00:56:32,191
Normally I don't say anything.

848
00:56:33,776 --> 00:56:35,151
And I know you're
thinking you're doing

849
00:56:35,153 --> 00:56:36,444
what you gotta do, right?

850
00:56:36,446 --> 00:56:37,280
But...

851
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:42,452
you gotta be careful.

852
00:56:45,205 --> 00:56:46,453
None of this is worth going out

853
00:56:46,455 --> 00:56:47,957
and getting yourself
killed over.

854
00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:51,792
That's very insightful of you.

855
00:56:51,794 --> 00:56:53,544
You know, I'm truly touched

856
00:56:53,546 --> 00:56:55,962
that you're concerned
about me like that,

857
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:57,298
but I tell you what,

858
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,341
if you like, you can come by my
house later, tuck me into bed,

859
00:56:59,343 --> 00:57:02,220
maybe give me a little
inner-thigh massage,

860
00:57:02,222 --> 00:57:03,136
but you worry 'bout you.

861
00:57:03,138 --> 00:57:04,805
You don't tell me what to do

862
00:57:04,807 --> 00:57:09,310
and you don't ever, ever
warn me like that, okay?

863
00:57:09,312 --> 00:57:10,313
I understand.

864
00:57:11,772 --> 00:57:12,649
You do you.

865
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,039
Right
over here, honey, please.

866
00:57:29,665 --> 00:57:31,832
Did you need a ride or...

867
00:57:31,834 --> 00:57:32,750
Uh-uh.

868
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:33,878
I think I'd rather walk.

869
00:57:34,671 --> 00:57:36,044
Okay, we'll be
back at the place

870
00:57:36,046 --> 00:57:37,839
for dinner tonight, all right?

871
00:57:37,841 --> 00:57:40,174
Call me if you see
or hear anything.

872
00:57:40,176 --> 00:57:41,216
I will.

873
00:57:41,218 --> 00:57:42,511
Okay.

874
00:57:52,147 --> 00:57:56,693
Joan, are you there?

875
00:57:58,736 --> 00:58:00,280
Stay away.

876
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:02,946
I figured I'd let you know

877
00:58:02,948 --> 00:58:04,450
that we're all okay.

878
00:58:05,993 --> 00:58:07,287
They found us a new shelter.

879
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:11,707
It's not okay.

880
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:15,211
It won't be until
they're all dead.

881
00:58:17,964 --> 00:58:18,840
You look terrible.

882
00:58:22,051 --> 00:58:22,968
Go.

883
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,765
Go far away and
never come back here.

884
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:33,646
Act like you've
never met me before.

885
00:58:35,231 --> 00:58:38,943
Sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

886
00:58:39,943 --> 00:58:40,986
It's not your fault.

887
00:58:43,238 --> 00:58:45,574
Just let me rest in peace.

888
00:59:13,644 --> 00:59:17,856
Miles, you're next.

889
00:59:24,113 --> 00:59:24,986
Where you going, huh?

890
00:59:24,988 --> 00:59:26,279
Where you going?

891
00:59:26,281 --> 00:59:27,156
You got her?

892
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:28,323
Got her, man.

893
00:59:28,325 --> 00:59:30,075
You can't
run back to the safety

894
00:59:30,077 --> 00:59:31,118
of your little shelter anymore.

895
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:31,953
It's gone.

896
00:59:31,955 --> 00:59:32,828
What happened to it?

897
00:59:33,832 --> 00:59:34,913
Why are you doing this?

898
00:59:34,915 --> 00:59:36,040
Killing me isn't
going to do anything.

899
00:59:36,042 --> 00:59:37,457
No, see?

900
00:59:37,459 --> 00:59:38,625
That's where you're wrong.

901
00:59:38,627 --> 00:59:40,044
It's gonna make me feel a lot better.

902
00:59:40,046 --> 00:59:41,671
God, you're cute.
Don't worry.

903
00:59:41,673 --> 00:59:42,839
I'm not gonna shoot you.

904
00:59:42,841 --> 00:59:44,881
I'm just gonna
collect a little debt.

905
00:59:44,883 --> 00:59:46,801
I have nothing
to do with this.

906
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:48,720
You're wrong.

907
00:59:48,722 --> 00:59:49,720
You have everything
to do with this.

908
00:59:49,722 --> 00:59:51,138
It's just business.

909
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:53,725
You mess with my customers,
I'll mess with you.

910
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,642
Time to take care of
this little annoyance.

911
00:59:55,644 --> 00:59:57,019
Let's do it, baby.

912
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,145
Let's do it.

913
01:00:00,649 --> 01:00:01,816
Ah, come on, Joan.

914
01:00:01,818 --> 01:00:03,316
You wanna dance, Joan, huh?

915
01:00:03,318 --> 01:00:04,986
Here to save the day again?

916
01:00:04,988 --> 01:00:05,986
Joan, watch out.

917
01:00:05,988 --> 01:00:07,573
Enough of your talk, lady.

918
01:00:13,412 --> 01:00:14,412
I don't know what
the problem is.

919
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:15,412
Every time I turn the lights on,

920
01:00:15,414 --> 01:00:16,497
bitches just be
disappearing on me.

921
01:00:18,167 --> 01:00:21,877
Ooh.

922
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:24,504
Oh shit.

923
01:00:24,506 --> 01:00:25,381
Come on, Joan.

924
01:00:25,383 --> 01:00:26,506
You wanna play?

925
01:00:26,508 --> 01:00:27,049
Let's fucking play, Joan.

926
01:00:28,093 --> 01:00:29,761
Fuck this.

927
01:01:30,906 --> 01:01:32,031
How 'bout you do
something about Miles,

928
01:01:32,033 --> 01:01:33,573
'cause he's already out of hand.

929
01:01:33,575 --> 01:01:35,283
He's gonna get everybody killed.

930
01:01:35,285 --> 01:01:36,243
It's fine.

931
01:01:36,245 --> 01:01:37,285
Just keep me updated.

932
01:01:37,287 --> 01:01:40,080
Jesus, Frank, what
happened to easy money?

933
01:01:40,082 --> 01:01:42,875
Arson, murder, too
high and level.

934
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:43,959
I trust him.

935
01:01:43,961 --> 01:01:46,046
He knows what he's doing.

936
01:01:47,131 --> 01:01:48,548
Will you give us a minute?

937
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:51,049
Will you
get me a sandwich?

938
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:53,093
I think you've wasted
enough of our time already.

939
01:01:53,095 --> 01:01:54,553
Oh, Jesu...

940
01:01:54,555 --> 01:01:56,888
You've been a good
friend and a good partner.

941
01:01:56,890 --> 01:01:58,265
There's no reason
that has to change.

942
01:01:58,267 --> 01:02:00,267
You just need to
have a little faith.

943
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:01,603
Everything's gonna be fine.

944
01:02:04,941 --> 01:02:05,942
Okay.

945
01:02:13,450 --> 01:02:16,703
Frank, you're not
gonna like this.

946
01:02:20,289 --> 01:02:21,540
You here to lecture me?

947
01:02:25,502 --> 01:02:27,127
I wanna
say I'm sorry.

948
01:02:27,129 --> 01:02:28,923
I heard about what
happened with Cheryl.

949
01:02:33,928 --> 01:02:35,013
It's not about her.

950
01:02:36,805 --> 01:02:38,513
Then what is this about?

951
01:02:38,515 --> 01:02:39,765
Revenge?

952
01:02:39,767 --> 01:02:41,144
What do you think?

953
01:02:44,606 --> 01:02:46,066
Getting
all settled in?

954
01:02:48,776 --> 01:02:50,234
It's nothing.

955
01:02:50,236 --> 01:02:52,071
Just a few things I
picked up off the street.

956
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,075
I wish you would listen to me.

957
01:02:57,077 --> 01:02:58,410
You can't keep doing this.

958
01:03:00,622 --> 01:03:02,040
You're not gonna stop me.

959
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:04,999
It's all I have left.

960
01:03:05,001 --> 01:03:07,836
You've got me, the
kids, the shelter.

961
01:03:08,963 --> 01:03:11,421
You mean the shelter
that they burned down?

962
01:03:11,423 --> 01:03:13,341
We'll get a new one.

963
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:16,678
We'll rebuild and move
on, just like you do.

964
01:03:24,729 --> 01:03:27,899
What makes you so different?

965
01:03:29,526 --> 01:03:32,026
What makes you stay with me

966
01:03:32,028 --> 01:03:35,529
when everyone else
has abandoned me?

967
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:36,696
Hm?

968
01:03:36,698 --> 01:03:38,158
I guess I'm just stubborn.

969
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,578
I'm not gonna give up on you.

970
01:03:57,845 --> 01:03:58,887
I like that about you.

971
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:13,694
Maybe you're right.

972
01:04:15,446 --> 01:04:19,781
Maybe we should just
forget about the past

973
01:04:19,783 --> 01:04:22,619
and move away,

974
01:04:24,164 --> 01:04:25,080
get out of here.

975
01:04:26,999 --> 01:04:28,001
It's for the best.

976
01:04:29,752 --> 01:04:33,587
Are we gonna get a house
with a white picket fence

977
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:35,589
and be a happy couple, hmm?

978
01:04:36,968 --> 01:04:38,761
Joan, it's not the time.

979
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:44,349
Now's the perfect time.

980
01:04:57,488 --> 01:04:58,405
It's cold.

981
01:04:59,948 --> 01:05:01,491
Do you want your
shirt back on?

982
01:05:01,493 --> 01:05:03,119
No, leave it off.

983
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:20,593
Wait, this isn't right.

984
01:05:20,595 --> 01:05:21,596
What's wrong?

985
01:05:23,807 --> 01:05:24,808
This isn't right.

986
01:05:32,481 --> 01:05:33,399
Relax.

987
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:45,096
Stay with me.

988
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:48,516
I'm not going anywhere.

989
01:07:03,531 --> 01:07:07,077
Get me something, anything
that connects to her.

990
01:07:08,827 --> 01:07:10,410
I got nothing.

991
01:07:10,412 --> 01:07:13,413
There's gotta be
a way to get to her.

992
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:16,000
You boys, always
thinking with your head

993
01:07:16,002 --> 01:07:17,087
and not your hearts.

994
01:07:18,463 --> 01:07:20,006
You gotta follow her heart.

995
01:07:20,756 --> 01:07:23,256
That's how you get to her.

996
01:07:23,258 --> 01:07:25,677
Remember her ex-boyfriend,
that social worker?

997
01:07:27,097 --> 01:07:28,553
Seems he's been
spending a lot of time

998
01:07:28,555 --> 01:07:29,723
at this warehouse lately.

999
01:07:32,685 --> 01:07:34,187
The 63rd Street warehouse.

1000
01:07:35,687 --> 01:07:37,270
It's been boarded up forever.

1001
01:07:37,272 --> 01:07:38,605
It's just a tax write-off.

1002
01:07:38,607 --> 01:07:39,651
What's so special
about that place?

1003
01:07:40,609 --> 01:07:41,443
I don't know.

1004
01:07:48,868 --> 01:07:52,537
Well, let's head down there
first thing tomorrow morning,

1005
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:53,455
find out.

1006
01:08:04,216 --> 01:08:06,385
Ho ho, my man.

1007
01:08:07,136 --> 01:08:08,220
Thanks.

1008
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,140
How's the head.

1009
01:08:12,142 --> 01:08:14,183
Ah, just a mild concussion.

1010
01:08:14,185 --> 01:08:15,642
Doc said I'll be good
in a couple weeks,

1011
01:08:15,644 --> 01:08:17,478
but in the meantime...

1012
01:08:19,399 --> 01:08:20,982
gave me some of the good stuff.

1013
01:08:22,318 --> 01:08:24,318
Maybe you oughta go
home and just rest up.

1014
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,569
Yeah, I wish I could, man,

1015
01:08:25,571 --> 01:08:28,322
but Frank has got
guys working overtime.

1016
01:08:28,324 --> 01:08:30,660
It's like he's on some sort
of crusade or something.

1017
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,498
Well, I'd rather
not talk about that.

1018
01:08:36,999 --> 01:08:38,624
Yeah?

1019
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:39,627
Why not?

1020
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:41,796
All right,

1021
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:46,843
between you and me,
just don't feel right.

1022
01:08:48,927 --> 01:08:52,179
Look, I've been with
Frank a lot of years

1023
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:55,224
and we have done
some crazy shit,

1024
01:08:55,226 --> 01:08:58,146
but nothing like
this, killing kids,

1025
01:08:59,146 --> 01:09:00,689
burning down a homeless shelter.

1026
01:09:03,525 --> 01:09:04,401
Whatever it takes.

1027
01:09:05,445 --> 01:09:06,986
I mean, it's just
business, right?

1028
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:08,278
Business,

1029
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:09,531
don't make me laugh.

1030
01:09:11,242 --> 01:09:12,994
There's gotta be
a line somewhere.

1031
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:16,039
How far are you willing to go?

1032
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:19,458
How much are we
willing to sacrifice?

1033
01:09:21,127 --> 01:09:22,212
I don't know, man.

1034
01:09:23,212 --> 01:09:24,338
Shit, I just work here.

1035
01:09:28,802 --> 01:09:29,969
I gotta get home.

1036
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:32,219
My old lady's on me

1037
01:09:32,221 --> 01:09:34,471
about all the time I'm
putting in around here.

1038
01:09:34,473 --> 01:09:36,557
Hey, I wish I had
an old lady on me.

1039
01:09:38,227 --> 01:09:40,143
We have a big
day tomorrow, dog.

1040
01:09:40,145 --> 01:09:41,730
You should rest up.

1041
01:09:43,107 --> 01:09:43,982
Ah.

1042
01:10:19,436 --> 01:10:21,187
We've got her.

1043
01:10:37,494 --> 01:10:39,455
It's too bad your
girlfriend's not here.

1044
01:10:42,292 --> 01:10:44,502
She's not around much
during the day, is she?

1045
01:10:46,712 --> 01:10:49,131
Look, we're done
with all this.

1046
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,301
We're leaving.

1047
01:10:52,135 --> 01:10:53,136
You won.

1048
01:10:58,475 --> 01:10:59,642
I have a message for Joan.

1049
01:11:01,226 --> 01:11:03,020
It's very important
that she get it.

1050
01:11:04,939 --> 01:11:06,688
Yeah, what's the message?

1051
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:11,988
That's the message.

1052
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:25,251
Who's there?

1053
01:11:28,378 --> 01:11:30,545
You've got a lot
of nerve coming here.

1054
01:11:30,547 --> 01:11:32,216
Haven't you caused
enough damage?

1055
01:11:33,802 --> 01:11:35,053
I'm sorry about what happened.

1056
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:41,349
Look, I know you
probably hate me,

1057
01:11:41,351 --> 01:11:44,393
but you're the only
person who can help.

1058
01:11:44,395 --> 01:11:45,728
I've been looking
everywhere for Anthony.

1059
01:11:45,730 --> 01:11:46,689
I can't find him.

1060
01:11:47,690 --> 01:11:49,357
You
don't know, do you?

1061
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:50,441
I don't have time for this.

1062
01:11:50,443 --> 01:11:51,569
Just tell me where he is.

1063
01:11:54,196 --> 01:11:55,448
He's not anywhere.

1064
01:11:56,365 --> 01:11:57,533
He's dead.

1065
01:12:02,122 --> 01:12:03,123
Dead?

1066
01:12:04,164 --> 01:12:05,872
What do you mean dead?

1067
01:12:05,874 --> 01:12:08,251
I mean he's gone
and it's all your fault.

1068
01:12:08,253 --> 01:12:09,376
If you hadn't gotten him
mixed up in all this,

1069
01:12:09,378 --> 01:12:10,587
he'd still be here.

1070
01:12:19,471 --> 01:12:22,559
Don't you dare judge me.

1071
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:26,728
You have no idea what
I've been through.

1072
01:12:26,730 --> 01:12:29,104
You sit up here in your
big comfortable house,

1073
01:12:29,106 --> 01:12:30,190
away from the world.

1074
01:12:32,276 --> 01:12:35,279
You don't know what it's like
for people like us out there.

1075
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:39,072
I've been doing
this a long time.

1076
01:12:39,074 --> 01:12:41,200
I see the damage you people do.

1077
01:12:41,202 --> 01:12:42,287
Why do you think I do this?

1078
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,789
It's to protect the world
from criminals like you.

1079
01:12:50,043 --> 01:12:56,381
I did everything I could
do to survive on the streets,

1080
01:12:56,383 --> 01:12:58,802
but don't you blame me.

1081
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,930
I would've never done
anything to hurt him

1082
01:13:03,932 --> 01:13:06,310
or cause him any kind of pain.

1083
01:13:12,484 --> 01:13:13,735
I loved him.

1084
01:13:34,631 --> 01:13:36,296
Hey.

1085
01:13:36,298 --> 01:13:37,300
I know you.

1086
01:13:39,886 --> 01:13:41,428
You don't
wanna know me.

1087
01:13:45,016 --> 01:13:46,643
Yeah, I do.

1088
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,155
Seems like we always get stuck.

1089
01:14:04,619 --> 01:14:05,995
Wheel goin' 'round.

1090
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:08,914
No matter how far we go,

1091
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:13,461
we're always right
back where we started.

1092
01:14:14,628 --> 01:14:17,089
No matter how much pain and
sorrow they've caused us,

1093
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,635
we keep going back to
that source of pain.

1094
01:14:25,848 --> 01:14:28,014
Pretty wise
words coming from a

1095
01:14:28,016 --> 01:14:30,185
prince of the streets,
like yourself.

1096
01:14:31,311 --> 01:14:32,312
I try.

1097
01:14:33,897 --> 01:14:37,025
Here, have some.

1098
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:48,872
Genuine rotgut.

1099
01:14:50,205 --> 01:14:51,207
Nice.

1100
01:15:16,482 --> 01:15:17,398
No no no.

1101
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,523
I know it.

1102
01:15:18,525 --> 01:15:20,319
I know it's tough.

1103
01:15:21,154 --> 01:15:22,903
What can you do, but to sit back

1104
01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:26,823
and look up at the
stars, revel at them.

1105
01:15:26,825 --> 01:15:28,410
Revel at the glory.

1106
01:15:30,245 --> 01:15:33,747
Isn't it amazing, universe?

1107
01:15:33,749 --> 01:15:37,210
I don't give a fuck
about the universe.

1108
01:15:37,212 --> 01:15:38,296
Anthony's dead.

1109
01:15:39,297 --> 01:15:41,257
If it weren't for me,
he'd still be alive.

1110
01:15:46,762 --> 01:15:49,265
I'm sure this
Anthony was special.

1111
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,941
I wish I could bring
him back, but I can't.

1112
01:16:03,946 --> 01:16:04,989
Thanks.

1113
01:16:16,543 --> 01:16:19,129
God, won't they ever shut up?

1114
01:16:22,798 --> 01:16:23,882
Who are
you talking about?

1115
01:16:28,555 --> 01:16:29,931
You can't hear them?

1116
01:16:30,848 --> 01:16:32,307
They're all around us.

1117
01:16:39,857 --> 01:16:41,443
Joan.

1118
01:16:52,494 --> 01:16:54,163
Frank, you son of a bitch.

1119
01:16:56,082 --> 01:16:57,167
Now you've done it.

1120
01:17:02,629 --> 01:17:04,673
Blood will fill the
streets tonight.

1121
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:12,347
Yes, but I will
do the bloodletting.

1122
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:17,809
You have the mark upon you.

1123
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:19,480
Leave now before it spreads.

1124
01:17:38,708 --> 01:17:41,878
Joan, at last.

1125
01:17:43,712 --> 01:17:45,547
Well, I see all the
stories are true.

1126
01:17:46,507 --> 01:17:47,966
Very impressive.

1127
01:17:49,135 --> 01:17:51,344
But you've also become
a real pain in the ass,

1128
01:17:51,346 --> 01:17:53,973
sticking your fingers into
other people's business.

1129
01:17:55,182 --> 01:17:56,350
Why'd you kill Anthony?

1130
01:17:57,685 --> 01:17:59,312
He never did anything to you.

1131
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:02,063
I didn't kill him.

1132
01:18:02,065 --> 01:18:03,063
You did.

1133
01:18:03,065 --> 01:18:05,734
We both
know that's not true.

1134
01:18:07,236 --> 01:18:08,570
What was I supposed to do?

1135
01:18:09,864 --> 01:18:12,240
You turned your back on us.

1136
01:18:12,242 --> 01:18:14,242
You betrayed my trust.

1137
01:18:14,244 --> 01:18:16,411
You didn't deserve my trust.

1138
01:18:16,413 --> 01:18:17,830
You never did.

1139
01:18:18,832 --> 01:18:20,249
I just finally realized that.

1140
01:18:21,376 --> 01:18:23,086
Poor little precocious Joan,

1141
01:18:24,294 --> 01:18:25,922
thinks she's the
top of the class,

1142
01:18:27,423 --> 01:18:29,215
but she doesn't realize
without me protecting her,

1143
01:18:29,217 --> 01:18:30,927
she'd have been dead
a long time ago.

1144
01:18:32,971 --> 01:18:35,595
I'm here to collect a debt

1145
01:18:35,597 --> 01:18:37,809
and you're not gonna stop me.

1146
01:18:40,102 --> 01:18:41,479
I don't think that you will.

1147
01:18:42,939 --> 01:18:44,441
Why's that?

1148
01:18:52,656 --> 01:18:55,452
Let's take a walk
down memory lane, hm?

1149
01:18:56,703 --> 01:19:03,793
When I was a kid, I didn't have
much going for me, aimless.

1150
01:19:05,503 --> 01:19:07,711
But there was a perfectly
good war going on

1151
01:19:07,713 --> 01:19:11,216
on the other side of the
world, called Desert Storm,

1152
01:19:12,342 --> 01:19:13,510
sounded romantic.

1153
01:19:14,471 --> 01:19:16,470
So, I signed up to
fight terrorists

1154
01:19:16,472 --> 01:19:19,432
and they shipped me off
to the middle of nowhere,

1155
01:19:19,434 --> 01:19:21,475
but we were
completely unprepared.

1156
01:19:21,477 --> 01:19:24,689
They had no idea what
we were up against.

1157
01:19:25,731 --> 01:19:29,276
It was sheer hell.

1158
01:19:30,403 --> 01:19:37,783
Snakes, scorpions, heat,
IEDS, and roadside bombers.

1159
01:19:37,785 --> 01:19:40,120
And I was a specialist.

1160
01:19:41,288 --> 01:19:45,582
So, I spent months at a
stretch alone in the desert,

1161
01:19:45,584 --> 01:19:48,171
nothing but sand and desolation.

1162
01:19:51,632 --> 01:19:53,842
I should've died there,

1163
01:19:56,512 --> 01:19:59,306
but there are also dark
forces in the desert,

1164
01:20:00,475 --> 01:20:03,895
very powerful,
very primal forces.

1165
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:06,940
And so I...

1166
01:20:08,525 --> 01:20:09,359
survived.

1167
01:20:11,026 --> 01:20:12,194
And I came back

1168
01:20:13,238 --> 01:20:16,365
and I brought some of
that darkness with me.

1169
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:21,536
That's a real nice story,

1170
01:20:21,538 --> 01:20:24,413
but what's it got to do with me?

1171
01:20:24,415 --> 01:20:26,042
We all have our own demons.

1172
01:20:27,334 --> 01:20:29,460
There's a darkness
on your soul, Joan.

1173
01:20:29,462 --> 01:20:31,545
I saw it when we first met.

1174
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:34,341
I knew were we meant
to be together.

1175
01:20:37,595 --> 01:20:38,680
Don't fight it.

1176
01:20:39,596 --> 01:20:41,557
We're all one big happy family.

1177
01:20:44,476 --> 01:20:46,104
Join us, Joan.

1178
01:20:48,897 --> 01:20:51,189
I can never join you,

1179
01:20:51,191 --> 01:20:53,901
not after everything
you've done.

1180
01:20:53,903 --> 01:20:56,153
What I've done is
help you to become

1181
01:20:56,155 --> 01:20:59,698
who you truly are, by
stripping away your weakness,

1182
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:02,410
the last remnant
of your humanity.

1183
01:21:02,412 --> 01:21:04,079
I have freed you.

1184
01:21:05,539 --> 01:21:07,415
And now it's time
for you to come home

1185
01:21:07,417 --> 01:21:08,793
where you belong.

1186
01:21:11,212 --> 01:21:15,133
I think I'll
decline, thank you.

1187
01:21:20,721 --> 01:21:21,722
I'm very disappointed...

1188
01:21:24,059 --> 01:21:25,185
but...

1189
01:21:26,061 --> 01:21:27,103
it's been fun.

1190
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:38,113
What are you gonna do?

1191
01:21:43,787 --> 01:21:46,203
You think you're the
only one with tricks?

1192
01:21:46,205 --> 01:21:47,287
Watch this.

1193
01:21:50,627 --> 01:21:52,751
How'd you do that?

1194
01:21:52,753 --> 01:21:56,964
Been around long enough
to learn a few things.

1195
01:22:23,784 --> 01:22:25,369
Very disappointed.

1196
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,163
Such a waste of potential.

1197
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:33,667
I won't stop until I kill you.

1198
01:22:46,181 --> 01:22:47,182
Hello?

1199
01:22:55,941 --> 01:22:57,526
Anthony, is that you?

1200
01:23:04,534 --> 01:23:05,452
I can hear you.

1201
01:23:14,918 --> 01:23:15,836
I can hear you.

1202
01:23:44,239 --> 01:23:45,449
Anthony?

1203
01:23:46,743 --> 01:23:48,326
It's me, Joan.

1204
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:49,245
Stay away from me!

1205
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:54,667
Let me help you.

1206
01:23:55,959 --> 01:23:56,877
What do you want?

1207
01:23:59,756 --> 01:24:01,758
I'm here to save you.

1208
01:24:05,762 --> 01:24:07,886
She thinks
she can save me,

1209
01:24:07,888 --> 01:24:09,223
but she's mistaken.

1210
01:24:09,848 --> 01:24:11,434
I'm beyond redemption.

1211
01:24:14,104 --> 01:24:15,562
I don't understand.

1212
01:24:17,147 --> 01:24:18,357
She doesn't understand.

1213
01:24:19,734 --> 01:24:21,444
Perhaps she never will.

1214
01:24:22,986 --> 01:24:26,908
Anthony is dead, gone forever.

1215
01:24:28,325 --> 01:24:29,783
There's only I.

1216
01:24:33,414 --> 01:24:34,623
And who are you?

1217
01:24:40,754 --> 01:24:45,718
I am your past
come to haunt you.

1218
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:58,103
Stop this now.

1219
01:24:58,105 --> 01:25:01,358
You are Anthony and I am Joan.

1220
01:25:08,574 --> 01:25:09,575
Joan.

1221
01:25:10,827 --> 01:25:12,285
I knew a Joan.

1222
01:25:12,287 --> 01:25:14,828
She was tough, but fair.

1223
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:16,915
Unfortunately, she died.

1224
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,459
No.

1225
01:25:19,461 --> 01:25:21,085
No.

1226
01:25:21,087 --> 01:25:22,711
I'm right here.

1227
01:25:22,713 --> 01:25:24,841
I'm right here in front of you.

1228
01:25:27,843 --> 01:25:28,845
You're confusing me.

1229
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,727
Pull yourself together.

1230
01:25:37,436 --> 01:25:39,687
Forget about the past.

1231
01:25:39,689 --> 01:25:43,234
We're here now and
I need your help.

1232
01:25:47,321 --> 01:25:52,077
We're gonna find the men
who did this to you, to us.

1233
01:25:53,285 --> 01:25:55,577
But I need you to be strong.

1234
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:56,705
Can you do that for me?

1235
01:26:00,376 --> 01:26:01,377
I will be strong.

1236
01:26:05,714 --> 01:26:06,673
Good.

1237
01:26:09,511 --> 01:26:11,885
Now let's go find this asshole

1238
01:26:11,887 --> 01:26:14,265
and teach him not
to mess with us.

1239
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:33,660
Okay.

1240
01:26:34,744 --> 01:26:35,912
Look around.

1241
01:26:36,745 --> 01:26:38,121
There's gotta be
some sort of clue

1242
01:26:38,123 --> 01:26:40,415
as to where he's hiding.

1243
01:26:40,417 --> 01:26:41,874
He has
left the building.

1244
01:26:41,876 --> 01:26:45,003
He's gone, never to return.

1245
01:26:55,097 --> 01:26:56,098
Leave it.

1246
01:27:03,522 --> 01:27:04,857
I can smell him.

1247
01:27:07,944 --> 01:27:09,195
He's gotta be here somewhere.

1248
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:18,618
Come on, Frank, where are you?

1249
01:27:38,641 --> 01:27:39,642
No.

1250
01:27:43,645 --> 01:27:44,563
It's no use.

1251
01:27:46,065 --> 01:27:48,443
He's hiding somewhere and
he doesn't wanna be found.

1252
01:28:02,748 --> 01:28:04,249
I bet I know someone who knows.

1253
01:28:16,887 --> 01:28:17,805
Hello, Neal.

1254
01:28:20,391 --> 01:28:21,392
Hey, Joan.

1255
01:28:23,311 --> 01:28:24,518
Here to collect a debt.

1256
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,771
Yeah, I know.

1257
01:28:28,482 --> 01:28:30,316
What we did to you was terrible.

1258
01:28:30,318 --> 01:28:32,320
I didn't have anything
to do with it.

1259
01:28:34,029 --> 01:28:35,697
I'm not here for you.

1260
01:28:36,533 --> 01:28:37,867
Where's Frank?

1261
01:28:38,575 --> 01:28:39,702
I know where he is.

1262
01:28:40,744 --> 01:28:42,329
I need you to let me go.

1263
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:46,749
Just show us where he is

1264
01:28:46,751 --> 01:28:48,878
and you won't get hurt.

1265
01:28:59,221 --> 01:29:01,390
Come on, this way.

1266
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,477
A little feature that wasn't
on the real estate listing.

1267
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:09,065
Joint's got a safe room.

1268
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:28,418
Ah, you finally found
my little sanctuary.

1269
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:30,669
Well done.

1270
01:29:31,587 --> 01:29:33,213
And I see you brought a friend.

1271
01:29:34,257 --> 01:29:37,093
Behold, I see an
angel before me.

1272
01:29:38,427 --> 01:29:41,888
But even Lucifer
was an angel once.

1273
01:29:41,890 --> 01:29:45,433
You and I both know
that's not why I'm here.

1274
01:29:45,435 --> 01:29:48,772
Yes, and I'm very
disappointed, Joan.

1275
01:29:50,272 --> 01:29:52,107
After all this,

1276
01:29:53,234 --> 01:29:55,236
after everything
I've done for you,

1277
01:29:56,529 --> 01:29:58,448
you turn your back on
your father like this.

1278
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:04,954
Very cute.

1279
01:30:05,788 --> 01:30:08,163
You're not my father.

1280
01:30:08,165 --> 01:30:10,166
My father was an abusive asshole

1281
01:30:10,168 --> 01:30:11,628
and an alcoholic.

1282
01:30:13,462 --> 01:30:15,505
You're birth-father, yes,

1283
01:30:15,507 --> 01:30:18,925
but I like to think that
you have come to think of me

1284
01:30:18,927 --> 01:30:20,470
as a father too.

1285
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:26,309
Don't you flatter yourself.

1286
01:30:30,355 --> 01:30:35,858
When I first met you,
you were a street punk,

1287
01:30:35,860 --> 01:30:38,947
a kid, but I took you in

1288
01:30:41,615 --> 01:30:44,325
and I molded you, turned
you into the killer

1289
01:30:44,327 --> 01:30:45,453
that you are today.

1290
01:30:48,832 --> 01:30:51,290
Who told you how to hold a gun?

1291
01:30:51,292 --> 01:30:52,293
I did.

1292
01:30:53,168 --> 01:30:54,669
Who taught you how to fight?

1293
01:30:54,671 --> 01:30:56,170
I did.

1294
01:30:56,172 --> 01:30:59,509
Who taught you how
to love, how to fuck?

1295
01:31:00,968 --> 01:31:03,678
Well, that was a long time ago

1296
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:05,347
and that time has passed.

1297
01:31:07,516 --> 01:31:11,810
Now it's time for the student
to become the teacher.

1298
01:31:21,823 --> 01:31:22,824
Very well.

1299
01:31:23,283 --> 01:31:24,367
This isn't good.

1300
01:31:29,122 --> 01:31:30,914
Leave her alone.

1301
01:31:41,551 --> 01:31:44,763
Now, it's just
you and me now,

1302
01:31:45,805 --> 01:31:47,054
just like it's always been.

1303
01:31:47,056 --> 01:31:48,389
What a shame.

1304
01:31:48,391 --> 01:31:50,265
We make such a good pair,

1305
01:31:50,267 --> 01:31:52,477
but that's all over now, Joan.

1306
01:31:55,481 --> 01:31:56,732
No.

1307
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:16,084
Joan, what are you doing?

1308
01:32:16,086 --> 01:32:17,419
Stop, stop.

1309
01:32:21,841 --> 01:32:22,881
Is this some kind of trick?

1310
01:32:22,883 --> 01:32:24,300
No, it's me.

1311
01:32:24,302 --> 01:32:25,303
It's Frank.

1312
01:32:27,388 --> 01:32:30,100
Kid, I didn't have a choice.

1313
01:32:32,435 --> 01:32:33,645
I had to survive.

1314
01:32:35,771 --> 01:32:39,359
I had a wife, kids,
waiting for me at home.

1315
01:32:43,029 --> 01:32:44,948
I did what I had to do.

1316
01:32:50,203 --> 01:32:51,454
I'm sorry, kid.

1317
01:33:09,888 --> 01:33:11,141
I'm sorry too, Frank.

1318
01:33:32,662 --> 01:33:33,495
Anthony.

1319
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:38,499
Anthony.

1320
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:41,669
Anthony, don't do this to
me again, Anthony, please.

1321
01:33:41,671 --> 01:33:43,295
Please.

1322
01:33:49,012 --> 01:33:50,678
Please.

1323
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:02,691
You.

1324
01:34:04,694 --> 01:34:07,236
I thought I killed you already.

1325
01:34:07,238 --> 01:34:09,362
You can't kill
me, little girl.

1326
01:34:09,364 --> 01:34:11,532
I'm already a part of you.

1327
01:34:11,534 --> 01:34:13,369
There's no point in fighting.

1328
01:34:14,244 --> 01:34:15,245
I've already won.

1329
01:34:16,663 --> 01:34:18,538
You haven't won shit.

1330
01:34:18,540 --> 01:34:20,207
Haven't I?

1331
01:34:20,209 --> 01:34:22,376
What are you feeling right now?

1332
01:34:22,378 --> 01:34:26,296
Hatred, anger, a
lust for vengeance?

1333
01:34:26,298 --> 01:34:27,381
That's me.

1334
01:34:27,383 --> 01:34:29,051
I'm already inside your head.

1335
01:34:30,261 --> 01:34:35,555
The more you hate, the
more we become entwined.

1336
01:34:44,066 --> 01:34:45,273
Delicious.

1337
01:34:59,415 --> 01:35:03,251
There's no place that you
can go that I won't find you.

1338
01:35:03,253 --> 01:35:06,631
We are bound to each other.

1339
01:35:08,717 --> 01:35:12,426
I'm sorry,
Anthony, I'm sorry.

1340
01:35:19,101 --> 01:35:21,978
You're alive, you're alive.

1341
01:35:25,775 --> 01:35:27,152
I remember who I was.

1342
01:35:32,949 --> 01:35:35,952
I refuse to
play by your rules.

1343
01:35:37,537 --> 01:35:39,286
You said I had a decision.

1344
01:35:39,288 --> 01:35:40,414
You said I had a choice.

1345
01:35:42,208 --> 01:35:44,461
I've made my decision

1346
01:35:45,211 --> 01:35:49,423
and this is what I choose.

1347
01:35:56,638 --> 01:36:01,019
Well, this, this
is more powerful.

1348
01:36:05,481 --> 01:36:06,690
I'm sorry, Frank,

1349
01:36:08,318 --> 01:36:10,070
but it's time for
you to go home.

1350
01:36:37,555 --> 01:36:38,597
So, have you seen
her since that night?

1351
01:36:39,891 --> 01:36:43,017
I like to think that
she's still out there.

1352
01:36:43,019 --> 01:36:45,355
I don't know, I think I saw
her a couple nights ago.

1353
01:36:46,689 --> 01:36:48,398
I was walking home late at night

1354
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:51,651
and I could feel someone
watching me from the shadows.

1355
01:36:51,653 --> 01:36:53,195
I bet it was her
watching over me.

1356
01:36:54,864 --> 01:36:55,906
I think you're seeing things.

1357
01:36:57,033 --> 01:36:58,032
I'm gonna be late.

1358
01:36:58,034 --> 01:36:59,367
Gotta go.

1359
01:36:59,369 --> 01:37:00,992
All right, be safe.

1360
01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:02,536
Oh, don't worry.

1361
01:37:02,538 --> 01:37:04,287
I'm sure Joan will keep me safe.

1362
01:37:13,382 --> 01:37:15,385
Hey, where you running?

1363
01:37:32,193 --> 01:37:33,734
What are you doing out
here so late by yourself?

1364
01:37:33,736 --> 01:37:35,944
Leave me alone.
I ain't got no money.

1365
01:37:35,946 --> 01:37:37,612
What do you mean
you ain't go no money?

1366
01:37:39,242 --> 01:37:44,247
Hey, where you're going,
you don't need any money.

1367
01:37:45,539 --> 01:37:46,582
Leave him alone.

1368
01:37:47,583 --> 01:37:48,916
What are you
gonna do about it?

1369
01:37:48,918 --> 01:37:51,171
No, dude dude
dude, that's Joan.

1370
01:37:52,172 --> 01:37:54,255
Yeah, you should
do what she says.

1371
01:37:54,257 --> 01:37:55,967
You don't wanna get
on her bad side.

1372
01:37:57,510 --> 01:37:58,762
Let's get outta here.

1373
01:38:09,396 --> 01:38:10,772
You should
watch yourself.

1374
01:38:10,774 --> 01:38:12,191
It's dangerous
out here at night.

1375
01:38:20,408 --> 01:38:21,450
Thanks.

1376
01:38:40,138 --> 01:38:45,138
