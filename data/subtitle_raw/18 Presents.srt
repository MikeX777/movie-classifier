1
00:01:04,833 --> 00:01:10,874
18 PRESENTS

2
00:01:14,916 --> 00:01:16,874
<i>Good idea, I like it.</i>

3
00:01:17,624 --> 00:01:19,094
I'll meet you at the office later,

4
00:01:19,124 --> 00:01:21,969
so you'll tell me if there are
other possibilities

5
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:25,083
or if you can think of
anything else, huh? All right?

6
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,583
Perfect, see you later, then. Bye-bye.

7
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:46,553
THINGS TO DO: 1. SWIMMING POOL MEMBERSHIP
2. MANUEL FOR NEW WEBSITE 3. PAINT ROOM

8
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,333
<i>Elisa?</i>

9
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,719
What?

10
00:01:49,749 --> 00:01:51,541
<i>Can you come upstairs?</i>

11
00:01:59,249 --> 00:02:01,208
I'm coming.

12
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,249
What's up?

13
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,208
I figured it all out.

14
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:08,219
So, listen to me for a second, huh?

15
00:02:08,249 --> 00:02:09,678
Yes, I have to go in five minutes, though.

16
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:13,291
Corner for us, Ruzzetti kicks it.
All right?

17
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,553
We all stand here on the edge of the
penalty box, all lined up like a train.

18
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:19,678
-And can it be done?
-Of course it can be done.

19
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:22,136
The ball is kicked:
Rullo attacks the first post,

20
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:26,344
Chiodelli attacks the second post, the two
in the middle block their center-backs

21
00:02:26,374 --> 00:02:29,553
and who remains in the center
of the penalty box all alone?

22
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,053
- Tasselli.
- Tasselli.

23
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:34,553
who is terrible with his feet,
but is the best we have with headers.

24
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,136
So am I or am I not a genius?

25
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,136
-They certainly don't expect it.
-Of course they don't,

26
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:41,344
-we score and I raise the National Cup!
-Are you crazy?

27
00:02:41,374 --> 00:02:43,803
-The National Cup!
-Put me down!

28
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:46,844
And if we win, I'll buy you a gift.
What would you like?

29
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:50,344
You know what I want, I asked you a month
ago. I want you to clean this room.

30
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:53,011
-Why don't you do it today?
-Because I have training today.

31
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:54,094
No, it's tonight.

32
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:57,219
Look, I thought about it, why don't
we make the baby's room over there?

33
00:02:57,249 --> 00:02:59,928
But from there you can see the road,
here there's the garden.

34
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,928
Oh well, when it feels like it,
it will come here and look out.

35
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,011
Come on, sorry, but this is my studio,
I have my things here.

36
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:08,261
It's not like this child can come
and suddenly it takes all the spaces.

37
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,541
Why do you always have to put things off?

38
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,344
Life goes on, things change,
there is nothing wrong.

39
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:17,416
So, for once, make me decide,
just to see the effect it has on you.

40
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:19,511
-You are right.
-Hm? Thank you.

41
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,678
-Next time you'll decide.
-All right.

42
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:26,208
But now at least clean up the walls,
so I can whitewash on the weekend.

43
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,136
-Should I say "okay"?
-Mm-hm.

44
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,416
-Then it's okay.
-Mh. Thank you.

45
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,969
-Come on, stop it. I have to go.
-You said five minutes.

46
00:03:33,999 --> 00:03:35,833
They passed.

47
00:03:37,499 --> 00:03:39,291
Have a nice day at work.

48
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:43,541
You never give up, huh?

49
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:49,053
You told me that Signor Giovanni was
a good person. But was not fair to me.

50
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,053
Gazim, what is the reason for the layoff?

51
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:54,928
I don't know, he says I'm slow, but
I always do everything, more than others!

52
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,428
Ok. I'll tell you what.

53
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:00,969
Now we look for a job, even part-time,
so you'll make ends meet,

54
00:05:00,999 --> 00:05:04,636
and then, when I have something more
stable, I'll let you know. All right?

55
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,708
InJob agency, good morning.

56
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,208
Yes, it's us.

57
00:05:09,499 --> 00:05:11,083
Help yourself.

58
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:17,541
We are open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
and from 4 p.m...

59
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,749
Can you take another deep breath?

60
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,874
Hold it.

61
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,208
Release.

62
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,166
-One moment.
-Is there a problem?

63
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,166
-Elisa, excuse me if I kept you waiting.
-How's he baby?

64
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,678
It was only a small placental abruption,

65
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:22,844
but the fluid is abundant,
the placenta is well positioned

66
00:06:22,874 --> 00:06:25,874
and the bleeding has already stopped.

67
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,969
-You can calm down, the baby girl is fine.
-It's a girl?

68
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:31,594
-Yes, hadn't they told you yet?
-No.

69
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:33,916
-It's a girl.
-Oh, God.

70
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:36,458
I hoped for it.

71
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,249
A girl.

72
00:06:42,666 --> 00:06:45,291
Unfortunately, though, there is a problem.

73
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,458
It's about you.

74
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:53,249
<i>We repeated the ultrasound examination...</i>

75
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:57,594
<i>twice and I've already asked for a biopsy.</i>

76
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,791
A... biopsy?

77
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,916
There is a... a suspect of cancer.

78
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:07,916
Have you chosen, ma'am?

79
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,458
-Ma'am?
-This one.

80
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,208
But I will see my daughter, right?

81
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,708
I will see my daughter. Right?

82
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,958
Do you need anything else?

83
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:02,916
No.

84
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:11,333
WELCOME ANNA 21-08-2001

85
00:09:12,124 --> 00:09:13,833
How pretty.

86
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:17,833
Look at the onesie.

87
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,791
Why don't we take it for our girl, too?

88
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,208
Anna.

89
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,249
Anna.

90
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,083
Hey.

91
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,249
Hi, Anna.

92
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:55,416
Do you want this one? Come.

93
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,458
One, two, three!

94
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:28,374
-You have to sing.
-<i>Happy birthday to you...</i>

95
00:10:31,749 --> 00:10:34,791
Good, good, good!

96
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:43,499
<i>Happy birthday to you... </i>Good girl!

97
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:11,999
Anna, Anna, Anna, Anna...

98
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,594
Come on, what are you waiting for?

99
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:20,499
-Do you want grandpa's help?
-Stop it.

100
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,083
Hey.

101
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,374
Come on, go ahead.

102
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,791
I don't want to.

103
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:31,666
Do you want us to open it later,
just you and me?

104
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,344
I already know what it is.

105
00:11:33,374 --> 00:11:38,708
I already know it too, but these children
here think that mom gave you a wardrobe.

106
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:44,678
Instead, in my opinion, if we open it,
everyone will envy you. Hm?

107
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,791
-All right.
-Okay.

108
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,136
Come on, Anna, play something!

109
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,374
Come on, Annina.

110
00:12:10,249 --> 00:12:12,053
Can I play something?

111
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:14,594
Of course you can play, Lorenzo, come on.

112
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:17,708
Come on, why don't you make
a nice four-handed song?

113
00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:27,136
-Ouch!
-Anna!

114
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,958
Anna, come back here immediately!

115
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,291
I never asked for a piano
and I don't want it!

116
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:36,261
Thank you very much, Alberto,
and sorry again. I'm sorry.

117
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:40,208
Never mind. Don't worry, keep calm.

118
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:44,094
On the contrary, are you sure
you don't want us to talk to her?

119
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:48,749
Again? He told you he'll take care of it,
don't insist, okay?

120
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:57,083
Please, don't reprimand her.
Sooner or later it had to happen.

121
00:12:57,124 --> 00:13:00,594
Actually, poor thing, she has been
far too good all this time.

122
00:13:00,624 --> 00:13:02,291
She has been good, yes.

123
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,791
You've been good too.

124
00:13:05,874 --> 00:13:07,886
Elisa would be proud of you.

125
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:11,916
Come on, let's go,
the girl is alone in the house.

126
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,208
Anna?

127
00:13:38,124 --> 00:13:39,624
Anna?

128
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:52,791
Anna?

129
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,291
Anna? Get down.

130
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,844
Anna, get down immediately from there,
it's dangerous, come on.

131
00:14:03,874 --> 00:14:06,083
Give me your hand, come down.

132
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:27,583
Anna, why are you doing this?

133
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,208
I don't want Mom's presents anymore.

134
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,874
Listen.

135
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:40,458
Mom...

136
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:43,499
left for a distant trip.

137
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,124
I don't believe it.

138
00:14:48,874 --> 00:14:51,916
But she's not distant in space.

139
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,999
She's distant in time.

140
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,208
Yeah.

141
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,583
Is she dead?

142
00:15:06,124 --> 00:15:08,458
Come to Daddy, come on.

143
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:39,083
-What are you doing?
-An inward dive.

144
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,428
Are you sure?
I've never made it from here.

145
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,916
Roberto told me. Trust me, we can do it.

146
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,499
Come on.

147
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,291
Foot.

148
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:00,303
What the fuck is she doing?

149
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:01,803
-Arms.
-Angelica!

150
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,469
Hey, Anna!

151
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:05,428
-One...
-Get off there!

152
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,874
-Girls! Angelica!
-Two...

153
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:10,708
-Three!
-Stop!

154
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:14,999
Oh, my God!

155
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:57,624
-How is she?
-Thank God she's fine.

156
00:17:57,666 --> 00:18:01,499
But she could've broken her back,
and your daughter too.

157
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,958
Do you want to her out of the team?

158
00:18:09,124 --> 00:18:10,791
She did it on purpose.

159
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:13,083
I have no choice.

160
00:18:14,374 --> 00:18:16,874
You were a coach too, you know...

161
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:21,541
Today is her birthday.

162
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:25,041
It's not an easy day for her.

163
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,208
You can't smoke in the car.

164
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:34,874
-Since when?
-Since today.

165
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:54,791
What the fuck did you put up? Garlands?

166
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,208
I'm not six years old.

167
00:18:57,249 --> 00:19:02,708
Listen... why don't you call your diving
friend and invite her to the party?

168
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:06,208
-So maybe you can apologize, too.
-She is not my friend.

169
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,261
And who are you friends with?

170
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:12,303
-No, because I would love to know.
-Look who's talking.

171
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:14,999
Look, you stay put and listen to me.

172
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,428
Do you think you're the only one hurting?

173
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,136
Have you ever thought about me?
About your grandparents?

174
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,219
You could have a life again.
You've had the time.

175
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:26,083
-I tried.
-But nobody lived up to my mother.

176
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,303
-Don't you dare talk about Mom--
-You too cannot take it anymore.

177
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,458
Every year
with this presents bullshit. Why?

178
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,303
-Because your Mom wanted it this way.
-But she is not here!

179
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,969
-She was never there for me!
-So what do you want to do?

180
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:38,511
Do you want to be pissed all your life?

181
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:40,636
It's better than believing in ghosts.

182
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,928
Listen, now you go into the house,

183
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:45,261
greet everyone,
open your mother's last present,

184
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:49,624
give a fucking smile
and then we'll have cake, okay?

185
00:19:49,749 --> 00:19:52,624
Like a nice happy family.

186
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:12,708
Yes, like a nice happy family.

187
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,041
What's wrong with your father?

188
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:27,916
Are you coming?

189
00:20:28,624 --> 00:20:31,999
-Come on, now throw that cigarette away--
-You too bugger off!

190
00:21:08,374 --> 00:21:11,041
-Where do you have to go?
-It depends.

191
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,053
Where are you going?

192
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,416
There is a place nearby. It has some
excellent beers. Do you want to go?

193
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:19,999
-Deal.
-Get in.

194
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:24,803
Love, look, the meeting with the client
keeps going on,

195
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,928
so I'm not coming,
I'll come back late. Don't wait up for me.

196
00:21:27,958 --> 00:21:30,249
I love you. Bye-bye. Bye.

197
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,219
-Hey.
-You all right?

198
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:47,166
Yes, I found a dime, it's good luck.

199
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:53,166
Look, the color is not that great, but
I guarantee you the taste is exceptional.

200
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,958
How old are you?

201
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:03,636
-And you?
-Guess.

202
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,166
Forty.

203
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:09,749
Thirty-nine. I'll be 40 next week.

204
00:22:10,041 --> 00:22:11,708
How did you guess?

205
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:15,833
You have the face of a 40 year old.

206
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,958
All right, okay.

207
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:28,874
My birthday is today, actually.

208
00:22:29,041 --> 00:22:30,761
We have to celebrate, then.
Let's celebrate.

209
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,833
There is nothing to celebrate, trust me.

210
00:22:34,041 --> 00:22:35,624
Why?

211
00:22:36,458 --> 00:22:40,499
Because today my mother died.

212
00:22:40,708 --> 00:22:42,208
Today?

213
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,333
No.

214
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:52,083
When I was born.

215
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,999
She didn't have time to see me.

216
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,136
But, on my birthday,

217
00:22:59,166 --> 00:23:03,874
her fucking present is always there.

218
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:06,624
You're joking, right?

219
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:11,053
I can't believe it.

220
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:16,249
I mean, you--
Your Mom was Elisa, Alessio's wife.

221
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:18,666
And who the fuck are you?

222
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:21,874
I'm Walter and you're Anna, right?

223
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:27,249
Alessio was my soccer coach.

224
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:31,999
I came to your house a lot of times,
I came to your first birthdays.

225
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:36,083
How fun, huh?

226
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:40,749
Does your father know you're here?

227
00:23:44,124 --> 00:23:46,844
From today I am of age, ok?
If you want to fuck me,

228
00:23:46,874 --> 00:23:49,094
-you don't have to ask permission to him.
-Fuck you? Are you kidding...?

229
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:50,886
What are you saying? Fuck? No way!

230
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:54,083
-Stop it, I'll take you home, come on.
-Hey, don't you touch me.

231
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,916
Should I call your father?

232
00:23:57,499 --> 00:24:00,428
-Mind your own business.
-I'm calling your father.

233
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:03,333
-What are you doing? Hey!
-I'm calling your father.

234
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:14,916
Hi Alessio, I'm Walter. No...

235
00:24:30,124 --> 00:24:32,469
Anna!

236
00:24:32,499 --> 00:24:34,666
What the fuck is going on?

237
00:24:39,916 --> 00:24:42,833
Anna!

238
00:24:44,458 --> 00:24:48,333
Anna, stop! Anna! Anna, no! No!

239
00:24:49,666 --> 00:24:51,499
Fuck, my motorbike!

240
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:57,541
Oh. Fucking stop! Stop!

241
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,541
Stop!

242
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:06,416
What the fuck are you doing?

243
00:25:06,874 --> 00:25:09,499
Stop!

244
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:14,749
Where the fuck are you going?

245
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:05,416
Are you okay?

246
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:09,041
Can you hear me? Are you okay?

247
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:14,178
But where did you come from?
I didn't see you coming.

248
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:16,083
I tried to brake, but...

249
00:26:18,833 --> 00:26:21,208
Can you get up?

250
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,583
Are you okay?

251
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:29,636
Yes, I'm fine.

252
00:26:29,666 --> 00:26:33,416
Why did you cross like that?
I could have killed you!

253
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:36,803
I waved.

254
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:39,636
You waved? But don't you see that
we are in the dark on a provincial road?

255
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,874
That's the last thing I needed.

256
00:26:45,499 --> 00:26:46,969
I'll take you to the hospital, let's go.

257
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:48,303
No, no, I'm fine.

258
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,666
-I can't leave you here like this, come!
-Not the hospital.

259
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:56,041
-Where are you taking me?
-Let's go to my house, for now.

260
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,624
It's close. Then we'll see.

261
00:27:20,666 --> 00:27:23,666
-You live here?
-Yes.

262
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:55,874
Come!

263
00:27:57,874 --> 00:27:59,458
Move!

264
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:03,428
-What's wrong with you?
-My head is spinning.

265
00:28:03,458 --> 00:28:06,374
Come on, let's go. Come in.

266
00:28:26,624 --> 00:28:28,749
I'll get you some water.

267
00:28:35,999 --> 00:28:37,499
Here.

268
00:28:40,124 --> 00:28:42,583
Dry your hair a little.

269
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:49,791
Wait, give it to me.

270
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:56,583
Ouch... does it hurt?

271
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:00,749
Give me a minute.

272
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:07,208
MAY 2001

273
00:29:32,874 --> 00:29:34,874
-Are you pregnant?
-Yes.

274
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:45,208
-And what's your name?
-Elisa. Sit down.

275
00:29:46,916 --> 00:29:48,583
Let me see.

276
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:54,208
Ah! But what is it?

277
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:57,833
It's nail polish remover, sorry.

278
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:02,499
-Is it burning?
-What do you think?

279
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:20,083
Come on.

280
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,416
Like this, okay? This way.

281
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,916
Elisa!

282
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,833
Who is it?

283
00:30:55,083 --> 00:30:56,136
Hi.

284
00:30:56,166 --> 00:31:01,374
Since no one will come see us in
Florence... at least we cheer ourselves.

285
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,386
-It's nice.
-Hi, Elisa.

286
00:31:05,416 --> 00:31:07,458
-Hi, Eli.
-Hello.

287
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:11,886
Okay guys, we're done for tonight.
You two, go to bed early.

288
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,833
-Good night.
-Bye.

289
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:15,583
Hello, sweetheart.

290
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,499
What's up?

291
00:31:22,791 --> 00:31:24,458
I...

292
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,636
-I ran over a girl.
-What?

293
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:32,791
Yes, but she's fine... at least I think.

294
00:31:32,874 --> 00:31:35,261
-You think?
-She just has a couple of scratches.

295
00:31:35,291 --> 00:31:37,011
Did you take her to the hospital?

296
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,678
No, she's in our living room.

297
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:41,458
In our living room?

298
00:31:43,583 --> 00:31:45,166
Are you okay?

299
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:47,458
-I'm fine.
-Okay.

300
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:54,999
Hello.

301
00:31:57,583 --> 00:32:00,208
Pleased to meet you, I am Alessio.

302
00:32:02,749 --> 00:32:04,333
Anna.

303
00:32:04,416 --> 00:32:06,374
How are you? Everything all right?

304
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,208
Does your arm hurt?

305
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:12,303
-Have we met before?
-I don't think so.

306
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:15,333
-No, because you seem--
-I have to go to the toilet, sorry.

307
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,666
-But the guest bathroom is downstairs!
-I prefer the other one.

308
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,874
How does she know?

309
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:08,333
WE'RE HAVING A BABY

310
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,928
-Should I check on her?
-What do I know!

311
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:38,053
Hey, keep calm!

312
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:41,333
-It's nothing.
-I've been up since 7 a.m.

313
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:44,583
We still have to eat
and there is a stranger upstairs--

314
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:50,583
Hello.

315
00:33:51,124 --> 00:33:54,541
It is not yet ready yet,
but if you are hungry,

316
00:33:54,874 --> 00:33:56,636
in the meantime, there are these.

317
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:59,344
-No thanks.
-They are delicious, you know?

318
00:33:59,374 --> 00:34:01,291
The house specialty.

319
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,333
Trust me.

320
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,428
Good.

321
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:18,833
If you tell us where you live,
we'll take you home.

322
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,916
-I don't live here.
-Oh.

323
00:34:21,999 --> 00:34:24,791
And what are you doing here?

324
00:34:26,749 --> 00:34:29,803
I... came to visit my mother.

325
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,958
-We will take you to her, then.
-No!

326
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:35,166
Because...

327
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:37,666
she's in the hospital.

328
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,874
-They hospitalized her today and...
-Ah. I'm sorry.

329
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,999
-But you have a place to sleep, right?
-Not at the moment.

330
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:50,041
Where is your father?

331
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:55,249
He travels a lot...

332
00:34:55,874 --> 00:34:58,374
The last time I heard from him,
he was in Africa.

333
00:34:59,624 --> 00:35:01,791
-South Africa.
-No less.

334
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:07,761
But it was a long time ago,
maybe now he's not there...

335
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:10,708
Yes. The water's boiling.

336
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:19,374
-Let's let her sleep here.
-What? No.

337
00:35:20,374 --> 00:35:22,303
Can't you take her to the Bellavia?

338
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:26,178
To the Bellavia? Elisa, honestly,
she still seems a little confused to me.

339
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,833
It feels bad to send her away.

340
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,833
Do as you like.

341
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:48,374
I put her on the sofa.

342
00:35:49,374 --> 00:35:50,874
Fine.

343
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:54,666
So I'll take her directly to the hospital
in the morning.

344
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,249
No, you have to leave at eight,

345
00:35:59,749 --> 00:36:02,291
I'll take her while going to the agency.

346
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:21,124
I thought that, since you can't come...

347
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:24,458
maybe with this on you can
bring me luck from here as well.

348
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,124
Hey. What's up?

349
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:32,583
Did I say something wrong?

350
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:34,583
It's nothing.

351
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:37,458
Eli.

352
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,583
You make me worry.

353
00:36:42,249 --> 00:36:45,708
It's beautiful. I'll wear it for sure.

354
00:37:49,624 --> 00:37:54,083
Listen, Eli, for these days that I'm away,

355
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:58,083
why don't we call someone
who comes to help you?

356
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:01,761
Help me with what?

357
00:38:01,791 --> 00:38:05,386
For everything.
To drive the car, to buy groceries.

358
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:09,469
-I don't want to leave you alone.
-I don't need a caregiver.

359
00:38:09,499 --> 00:38:11,833
I didn't say that!

360
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:14,386
You spend a few days
with a friend of yours.

361
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:17,011
With Patrizia, with Marianna,
with whoever you want.

362
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:18,749
Alessio, please.

363
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:22,178
-Why, did I say something strange?
-I already answered you.

364
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:24,416
"I already answered you."

365
00:38:24,666 --> 00:38:27,636
-Let's try to call your cousin.
-Again?

366
00:38:27,666 --> 00:38:30,124
If I need her, I'll call her, okay?
That's enough.

367
00:38:30,541 --> 00:38:32,208
Good morning.

368
00:38:32,749 --> 00:38:34,094
-Oh, good morning.
-Good morning.

369
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:36,874
-I made coffee.
-Thank you.

370
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:40,636
Oh well, I'm staying here, I'm not going.

371
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:42,178
What are you talking about?

372
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:44,761
Yes, Elisa, it is useless for me to go

373
00:38:44,791 --> 00:38:47,416
and then spend all my time
thinking about you here alone.

374
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,303
You're pregnant.

375
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,886
-I'll call Mauro and get replaced.
-Mauro?

376
00:38:51,916 --> 00:38:54,553
But it's the final!
When you do this I can't stand you!

377
00:38:54,583 --> 00:38:57,416
-Look, it's only for two days.
-Do you think they're short?

378
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:03,124
I'll tell you what, she'll help me out.
Do you want to stay here a couple of days?

379
00:39:03,749 --> 00:39:06,458
-Her?
-Yes. You said "who I want".

380
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:13,833
-Do you have a driver's license?
-Of course she has it.

381
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,541
-What are you doing?
-Uhm...

382
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:32,041
The gear!

383
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:36,583
-The gear...
-Like this, come on!

384
00:39:41,874 --> 00:39:43,886
Come on, get off, I'll drive.

385
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:47,249
-Mine is different.
-Yeah.

386
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:58,208
Where are we going?

387
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:01,958
I'll take you to your mother,
to the hospital.

388
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:07,053
But don't I have to take you to work?

389
00:40:07,083 --> 00:40:10,666
Look, thank you,
but I don't need anyone, really.

390
00:40:29,999 --> 00:40:32,041
Do you have any money?

391
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:36,333
Then, bye.

392
00:40:41,208 --> 00:40:43,541
And sorry again for yesterday!

393
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:51,583
Elisa?

394
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:54,999
They set you up, huh?

395
00:41:55,833 --> 00:41:57,583
I'm Carla.

396
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:01,416
Don't you remember? Carla Capitani,
you found me that interpreter job.

397
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:03,136
Carla, of course.

398
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:06,011
Now I no longer work there,
now I teach English at an evening school.

399
00:42:06,041 --> 00:42:08,541
Do you remember I was looking for a chair?

400
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:11,303
-No, I honestly don't remember.
-Well, it has arrived.

401
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,624
What are you doing here?
You too with the Great Bastard?

402
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,178
Who, sorry?

403
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:18,208
The Great Bastard.
The king of the gatecrashers.

404
00:42:19,583 --> 00:42:22,541
Mine is here for almost a year.

405
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,261
I'm sorry.

406
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:26,428
Well, what can you do,
he grew fond of them.

407
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,833
I don't blame him,
with two boobs like these!

408
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:33,999
So you say that
he'll get tired of mine soon?

409
00:42:39,541 --> 00:42:40,719
How long have you known?

410
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:43,499
Since yesterday,
but I'm still really confused.

411
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:47,041
And I haven't told anyone yet.

412
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:49,011
Well, let's get this done right away.

413
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:51,958
-Good morning everyone.
-Good morning.

414
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:53,666
I see new faces.

415
00:42:53,708 --> 00:42:56,636
Yes, but for the moment
my friend prefers not to speak.

416
00:42:56,666 --> 00:42:58,458
Sure, as you wish.

417
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,719
And you, Carla, where were you?

418
00:43:00,749 --> 00:43:02,249
You missed me?

419
00:43:04,249 --> 00:43:06,094
I had an unexpected event at work.

420
00:43:06,124 --> 00:43:07,844
With a student of mine.

421
00:43:07,874 --> 00:43:09,749
What kind of event?

422
00:43:10,416 --> 00:43:11,844
I slept with him!

423
00:43:11,874 --> 00:43:13,541
Bravo!

424
00:43:14,333 --> 00:43:15,719
Look, was he an adult, at least?

425
00:43:15,749 --> 00:43:18,678
Judging from the experience in the use
of the tongue, I would say he is.

426
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:20,958
They all happen to her, all of them.

427
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:24,636
Okay, okay. But was he the one
you told us about last time?

428
00:43:24,666 --> 00:43:27,511
No, this was another one,
I'd never thought about him.

429
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:30,011
However, it still is
psychological support, you know,

430
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,553
in fact I thought of you all the time.

431
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,499
Oh yes, of course.

432
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,416
Yes?

433
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:42,041
-Sorry.
-Please. Are you looking for someone?

434
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:47,624
My mom is here
in the hospital for a tumor.

435
00:43:48,874 --> 00:43:51,969
-They told me I could come here...
-Of course.

436
00:43:51,999 --> 00:43:54,499
Welcome. What's your name?

437
00:43:56,874 --> 00:43:58,749
-Anna.
-Anna.

438
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:06,708
And who is your mom?

439
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:09,541
She was hospitalized yesterday.

440
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:13,708
She is in intensive care.

441
00:44:14,208 --> 00:44:16,916
And your father? Are you here alone?

442
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:19,999
How do you do it? Where do you sleep?

443
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:22,208
I don't know.

444
00:44:22,541 --> 00:44:26,594
If you have to eat, my husband owns
a pizzeria less than a mile from here.

445
00:44:26,624 --> 00:44:28,594
We own a bar.

446
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,386
My parents have an extra room, if you want
I can ask them, what do you say?

447
00:44:31,416 --> 00:44:34,636
Girls, don't exaggerate,
or she'll get confused.

448
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,874
Do you really have no one here?

449
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:39,428
No, but I don't need anything.

450
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:43,583
It would be enough for me
to find a job, so I can get by.

451
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:46,333
She owns a temp agency.

452
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,749
Why didn't you say anything to Alessio?

453
00:44:56,499 --> 00:44:58,416
What did you say your name is?

454
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:02,249
-Anna.
-Surname?

455
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,761
"IF YOU WANT TO LIVE A HAPPY LIFE,
SET A GOAL" - OSVALDO GIROTTO

456
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,374
Girotto.

457
00:45:06,666 --> 00:45:09,583
-Can you give me an ID?
-Um...

458
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,666
I guess I forgot it at home.

459
00:45:16,458 --> 00:45:18,291
You don't have a driver's license.

460
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:20,803
-No.
-Oh well, how old are you?

461
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:24,291
Seventeen. No, sorry. Eighteen.

462
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:27,999
You cannot smoke in here.

463
00:45:29,541 --> 00:45:31,041
Yes, sir.

464
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,386
So, there's an event
at the golf club tonight.

465
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:37,333
And do we want to miss it?

466
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:39,928
The president's son is getting married.

467
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:43,416
Catering is complete, but I think
they could use another person.

468
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:45,416
What size do you wear?

469
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:48,083
I don't know.

470
00:45:48,124 --> 00:45:49,666
Get up.

471
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,458
I would say you're a size two.

472
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:02,053
-Don't you have another pair of shoes?
-Why, are these not okay?

473
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,428
It's not their style, no.

474
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,666
And what is their style?

475
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:09,791
-Like yours?
-Yes, better.

476
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,624
So let's exchange them.

477
00:46:12,374 --> 00:46:14,499
Come on, I'll bring them back.

478
00:46:14,874 --> 00:46:17,166
What is it, are you afraid
that I will steal them?

479
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:28,166
-Thank you.
-It's my job.

480
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:32,124
Yes, but I don't think it's easy for you.

481
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,874
And for you.

482
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:41,219
<i>I asked for a hotel without TVs in the</i>
<i>rooms, so they wouldn't go to bed late,</i>

483
00:46:41,249 --> 00:46:43,636
<i>and instead there are huge screens.</i>

484
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:45,469
Oh, well, they are not children.

485
00:46:45,499 --> 00:46:48,874
<i>Go figure. Did you put your shirt on?</i>

486
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,761
Sure. I'm wearing it.

487
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:53,374
<i>Nice, thanks.</i>

488
00:46:53,874 --> 00:46:55,749
<i>I feel you close to me.</i>

489
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:57,458
<i>What about the rest?</i>

490
00:46:57,624 --> 00:46:59,136
We were going to sleep.

491
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:01,094
<i>Oh, okay. Then I leave you to it.</i>

492
00:47:01,124 --> 00:47:03,261
<i>-Goodnight.</i>
-Goodnight.

493
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:06,386
<i>-Goodnight. I love you.</i>
-Me too.

494
00:47:06,416 --> 00:47:08,958
THINGS TO DO

495
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:36,374
Thank you.

496
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,833
You could also bring them back to me
tomorrow morning.

497
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:42,053
-Are you already done?
-Yes, there was nothing left to do.

498
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:43,791
May I?

499
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:45,749
My shoes.

500
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:49,166
I'll get them right away.

501
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,261
-How did it go?
-Fine.

502
00:48:00,291 --> 00:48:03,678
-The usual pain in the ass.
-Problems?

503
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:06,791
No. It's just that I hate weddings.

504
00:48:07,666 --> 00:48:11,999
Everyone's beautiful and smiling...
This is taking the piss, come on.

505
00:48:12,499 --> 00:48:14,791
-Did you eat?
-No.

506
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:18,136
I am starving. Can I make myself a toast?

507
00:48:18,166 --> 00:48:20,499
I forgot to shop for groceries.

508
00:48:20,749 --> 00:48:22,886
If you want, I have fish sticks
in the freezer.

509
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:25,291
-I hate fish.
-So...

510
00:48:26,624 --> 00:48:29,094
But isn't there a place nearby
to go eat something?

511
00:48:29,124 --> 00:48:31,303
There is one, but you need the car.

512
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:33,261
-Can you take me?
-No.

513
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,833
-Please!
-No.

514
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:41,499
No, put it down.

515
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:43,458
Put it down. Hey!

516
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,624
-What's written on it?
-Give it to me!

517
00:48:47,791 --> 00:48:50,374
-Give it to me!
-Only if you take me.

518
00:48:50,958 --> 00:48:52,583
No!

519
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,219
Who's honking?

520
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,083
What is she doing?

521
00:49:24,708 --> 00:49:26,791
Don't you eat your fries?

522
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:29,208
Do you want them?

523
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:35,553
If there is something you like very much,

524
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,886
do you eat it immediately
or leave it at the end?

525
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:39,416
At the end.

526
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,844
We don't really have
a fucking thing in common.

527
00:49:41,874 --> 00:49:43,624
Thank God.

528
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,041
Pass me the fries.

529
00:49:51,874 --> 00:49:55,374
But you come down from there, come on.
Come down, you make me anxious.

530
00:49:57,541 --> 00:50:00,053
This sandwich is shitty,
it tastes like a wet dog.

531
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:03,124
I told you everything was closed,
what did you expect?

532
00:50:04,833 --> 00:50:06,886
Why didn't you go live somewhere else?

533
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,303
Like where?

534
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:10,958
You must've thought about it
at least once.

535
00:50:12,374 --> 00:50:14,583
No? Okay.

536
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:18,249
I did, once.

537
00:50:19,666 --> 00:50:21,511
I would have liked to go to London.

538
00:50:21,541 --> 00:50:23,333
And why didn't you go?

539
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:27,344
Ha-ha! You don't know English.

540
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:30,719
-Look, people go there to learn it.
-It's not like that.

541
00:50:30,749 --> 00:50:33,166
I could not live in London.

542
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,886
It's too big, I'm better here.

543
00:50:36,916 --> 00:50:39,219
What's so beautiful about this place?

544
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,874
-It's empty as shit.
-What do you know?

545
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,583
I can tell.

546
00:50:46,708 --> 00:50:49,624
Instead, there are a lot
of nice things to do here.

547
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:53,333
-Like?
-Like...

548
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:57,541
-Like coming here.
-Here?

549
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:59,666
To do what?

550
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:03,374
-What do you think?
-No!

551
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:08,124
-But with whom, with Alessio?
-Eh...

552
00:51:09,958 --> 00:51:13,874
-And then I got pregnant.
-So you made her here?

553
00:51:14,749 --> 00:51:16,749
No, not her.

554
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:20,208
It was three years ago, then I lost it.

555
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,833
What about her?

556
00:51:27,666 --> 00:51:29,416
She...

557
00:51:30,249 --> 00:51:31,916
In the garage.

558
00:51:34,208 --> 00:51:36,833
-In the garage?
-Yes, in the garage.

559
00:51:39,416 --> 00:51:40,958
Fuck!

560
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,844
-What happened?
-I forgot my jacket.

561
00:51:43,874 --> 00:51:47,208
-Oh well, I'll give you mine.
-The house keys were inside!

562
00:51:47,416 --> 00:51:49,041
Oh God...

563
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:53,041
Come on, we'll figure something out.
Don't worry, come on.

564
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:56,166
-An ID, please.
-Yes.

565
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,553
There you go.

566
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:01,666
Yes. I also need your daughter's.

567
00:52:04,749 --> 00:52:06,416
Oh, sure.

568
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,011
She doesn't have it.

569
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:13,124
She doesn't have it because
we got locked outside the house.

570
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:16,333
All right.

571
00:52:17,874 --> 00:52:20,053
There you go. Room 24, second floor.

572
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,719
-Thank you.
-Breakfast from 7 to 10 a.m.,

573
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:23,624
the lift is on the right.

574
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:28,083
Your daughter took the stairs.

575
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:03,469
Hi.

576
00:53:03,499 --> 00:53:05,999
Where did you learn to dive like this?

577
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:08,374
I took a course.

578
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:13,541
Come on, the water's wonderful.

579
00:53:13,583 --> 00:53:14,969
We can't, it's late.

580
00:53:14,999 --> 00:53:16,678
Who cares! Come!

581
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:18,208
No, get out!

582
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,803
-I'll start screaming.
-No!

583
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,041
-Come!
-Shh!

584
00:53:23,458 --> 00:53:26,541
-Come on!
-Okay, I'm coming.

585
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,708
-Do you need help?
-I can do it.

586
00:53:43,958 --> 00:53:46,499
-It's cold!
-It's not cold!

587
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:48,791
It is very cold!

588
00:53:56,041 --> 00:53:58,874
-Do you admit that it's wonderful?
-It's gorgeous.

589
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:02,428
But can't you swim?

590
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:04,166
I float.

591
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:07,833
Look, I can do this too.

592
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:11,333
-Wow!
-Huh? She's helping me.

593
00:54:14,624 --> 00:54:16,374
Wonderful.

594
00:54:17,333 --> 00:54:19,583
I admit it's not bad.

595
00:54:29,041 --> 00:54:31,999
What's wrong? Hey!

596
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:33,636
-She moved.
-What?

597
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:35,458
She moved!

598
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,803
-Have you felt it?
-Yes!

599
00:54:45,833 --> 00:54:47,541
Oh God!

600
00:54:49,666 --> 00:54:51,094
-Oh God...
-Wow.

601
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:52,178
It's crazy.

602
00:54:52,208 --> 00:54:54,333
Feel how she moves.

603
00:55:05,541 --> 00:55:07,208
I have to pee.

604
00:55:07,374 --> 00:55:10,416
-Are you crazy?
-I'm joking!

605
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:16,124
You don't know how hard it was
to get a bottle of water.

606
00:56:47,291 --> 00:56:51,083
1. PAINT ROOM 2. BUY CRADLE

607
00:56:55,666 --> 00:57:00,416
3. CHOOSE PLAYSCHOOL 4. FIND A BABYSITTER

608
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,999
-There you go. Done.
-Thank you.

609
00:57:58,624 --> 00:58:01,249
-These are to be thrown away, right?
-These ones, too.

610
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:14,428
What about this?

611
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:16,553
I got it at a concert.

612
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,416
Why are you throwing it away?

613
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,749
She would just think of it
as an old T-shirt.

614
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:27,333
-I think she would like it.
-You think?

615
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,166
Then put it over there.

616
00:58:34,208 --> 00:58:38,094
Listen, I was thinking about
that diving course you mentioned.

617
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:39,916
What if I give it to her?

618
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:47,636
-What do you mean?
-I could gift it to her.

619
00:58:47,666 --> 00:58:49,136
No, you can't.

620
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:52,124
-Why do you think that?
-Because you don't know her.

621
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,999
You don't know if she'll like it.

622
00:58:54,249 --> 00:58:55,958
But I picture she will.

623
00:58:58,624 --> 00:59:00,916
And how do you picture her?

624
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:05,541
How do I picture her?

625
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,833
Blonde hair...

626
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,708
Alessio's dark eyes...

627
00:59:19,499 --> 00:59:21,428
However, the important thing
is that she is beautiful on the inside.

628
00:59:21,458 --> 00:59:25,469
-On the inside?
-Yes, a strong and determined person.

629
00:59:25,499 --> 00:59:28,041
A positive person, yes, above all.

630
00:59:28,208 --> 00:59:30,136
What do you mean by that?

631
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:32,583
Someone who has faith in others.

632
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:35,499
-A fool?
-No, an altruist.

633
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:40,094
Someone who doesn't need to step over
the others to get what she wants.

634
00:59:40,124 --> 00:59:41,928
Someone who gets pushed around?

635
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:44,208
Is this really how you see life?

636
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,386
And what do you want,
a daughter or a doll?

637
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,928
She won't be cocky and insolent
like you, that's for sure.

638
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,249
But not a carbon copy
of her mother, either.

639
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:04,166
Hello?

640
01:00:04,333 --> 01:00:05,833
Yes, good morning.

641
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:09,958
What do you mean "she left"?

642
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:12,666
No, she didn't tell me anything.

643
01:00:14,624 --> 01:00:16,499
I'm sorry.

644
01:00:16,833 --> 01:00:18,636
It won't happen again.

645
01:00:18,666 --> 01:00:20,874
Thank you. Again, I'm so sorry.

646
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,803
You're a liar, too!

647
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:29,541
That was the catering owner, he said
you ran away without a warning.

648
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:31,219
Tell me why you lied!

649
01:00:31,249 --> 01:00:33,469
Why do you care? It was my job, not yours.

650
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:36,386
Your job? Who got you that job?
Who vouched for you?

651
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:39,719
Do you even know how hard I had to work
to earn my clients' trust?

652
01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:43,208
Why do you care about clients? You have
cancer and you think about your clients?

653
01:00:48,749 --> 01:00:50,719
Those were shitty people.

654
01:00:50,749 --> 01:00:53,999
And I didn't want to be there,
since my mother is sick.

655
01:01:21,666 --> 01:01:24,583
Soccer is a crappy sport.

656
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:28,594
You set yourself a goal, you spend
the whole season trying to make it happen,

657
01:01:28,624 --> 01:01:32,094
you evaluate all scenarios,
calculate all odds,

658
01:01:32,124 --> 01:01:34,469
you study your opponents,
and then what happens?

659
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:38,053
There comes Tasselli, that dickhead.

660
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:42,136
The worst right-back in the world.

661
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:45,094
- And he's part of your team...
- Alessio.

662
01:01:45,124 --> 01:01:46,928
- Tasselli, when there's a corner...
- Alessio.

663
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,999
-...you don't have to stay here--
- Alessio!

664
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:57,208
What is it?

665
01:01:58,916 --> 01:02:02,416
The other day I went to the hospital
for a leak.

666
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:05,469
Is there a problem with the baby?

667
01:02:05,499 --> 01:02:06,999
It's a girl.

668
01:02:08,041 --> 01:02:09,511
- Really? A girl?
- She's alright.

669
01:02:09,541 --> 01:02:12,749
She's fine. It's me who...

670
01:02:13,874 --> 01:02:15,374
What?

671
01:02:16,958 --> 01:02:18,458
I...

672
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,333
I have cancer.

673
01:02:21,916 --> 01:02:23,583
Breast cancer.

674
01:02:41,749 --> 01:02:43,833
Why didn't you tell me right away?

675
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:46,708
You had the final.

676
01:03:02,416 --> 01:03:04,958
<i>I have seen the MRI report</i>

677
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:08,416
<i>and unfortunately I can only confirm</i>
<i>my colleagues' diagnosis.</i>

678
01:03:08,624 --> 01:03:11,749
<i>It is a metastatic triple negative</i>
<i>in an advanced state.</i>

679
01:03:12,249 --> 01:03:16,791
<i>Unlike the hospital, however, our clinic</i>
<i>adopts an experimental protocol,</i>

680
01:03:17,041 --> 01:03:20,636
<i>which in some cases has registered</i>
<i>a 30 percent greater effectiveness.</i>

681
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,374
<i>And when could we start?</i>

682
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:25,553
<i>Well, the sooner the better.</i>

683
01:03:25,583 --> 01:03:30,541
In your case, the course of treatment must
be postponed to complete the pregnancy.

684
01:03:30,791 --> 01:03:33,666
Unless you decide to have an abortion.

685
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:36,969
Are you asking us to choose between
our daughter's life and mine?

686
01:03:36,999 --> 01:03:39,511
No, I'm just telling you how it is.

687
01:03:39,541 --> 01:03:43,666
And with this new protocol...

688
01:03:44,499 --> 01:03:47,624
what percentage of healing
would we be facing?

689
01:03:48,374 --> 01:03:52,844
Basically, in these cases
it is just to slow it down.

690
01:03:52,874 --> 01:03:54,969
As much as possible,
but just to slow it down.

691
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:58,958
What do you mean by... "slow it down"?

692
01:04:02,833 --> 01:04:04,916
There's no healing
from this type of cancer.

693
01:04:08,749 --> 01:04:10,636
-No, that's what you say.
-Alessio, please.

694
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:13,291
Who the fuck are you, huh?

695
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:17,011
You, who are here deciding who lives
and who dies with this fucking tie! Huh?

696
01:04:17,041 --> 01:04:19,333
Do I have to trust a guy like that?

697
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:22,499
-Sit down.
-Let's go away, come on.

698
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:35,166
<i>Yes.</i>

699
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,624
<i>Yes, yes, it's fine.</i>

700
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:40,666
<i>Okay, okay, so I'll call you tonight.</i>

701
01:04:42,374 --> 01:04:44,719
<i>But he's good, isn't he?</i>

702
01:04:44,749 --> 01:04:48,541
No, because the one from this morning...
Let's not even go there.

703
01:04:51,708 --> 01:04:53,749
She's here, I'll tell her you say hi.

704
01:04:55,666 --> 01:04:57,303
It was Mauro.

705
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,636
He says he can get us an appointment
with the head physician

706
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:01,178
of the Niguarda in Milan,
they're good there.

707
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:04,624
-Can we talk about it later?
-Yes, sorry. I'm sorry.

708
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:06,541
Sorry.

709
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:13,958
I guess you bet on the wrong horse.

710
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:16,803
-Elisa, don't say bullshit, huh?
-I'm sorry.

711
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:19,969
Don't say bullshit!
I bet on the best horse!

712
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,219
Do you understand?
On the best horse in the world!

713
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:26,094
Do you remember what the doctor told us
when you couldn't get pregnant?

714
01:05:26,124 --> 01:05:27,969
-That was different.
-Do you remember it?

715
01:05:27,999 --> 01:05:31,969
That you always make it. Always!
And this goes to show it.

716
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:36,041
-I won't be able to see her grow.
-Shut up. Shut up.

717
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:40,166
Shut up. Shut up, please.

718
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,708
It would've been better
if she wasn't here.

719
01:05:48,958 --> 01:05:51,083
Shut up...

720
01:06:25,333 --> 01:06:30,208
<i>At work everyone knows I'm sick,</i>
<i>but nobody tells me anything.</i>

721
01:06:30,666 --> 01:06:32,333
<i>They pretend.</i>

722
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:35,374
Maybe to make me feel normal...

723
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:37,928
and instead they make me feel even sicker.

724
01:06:37,958 --> 01:06:39,678
You know, it's better if they pretend.

725
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:41,969
It's better, so you don't have to hear,

726
01:06:41,999 --> 01:06:45,416
"You will make it", "Now you have
to rely only on yourself"...

727
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:50,666
"Keep fighting!" This one beats them all.

728
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:54,541
Maybe you should be the one
talking to colleagues, you know?

729
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,916
Maybe you can't because you're ashamed.

730
01:06:58,749 --> 01:07:00,958
After all, we are all ashamed here.

731
01:07:00,999 --> 01:07:02,344
Why me?

732
01:07:02,374 --> 01:07:04,344
What have I done wrong? Hm?

733
01:07:04,374 --> 01:07:05,969
A spoiled food? Passive smoking?

734
01:07:05,999 --> 01:07:07,844
Those three tanning beds
I had two years ago?

735
01:07:07,874 --> 01:07:11,916
The point is, there is no real reason.

736
01:07:12,624 --> 01:07:14,553
We are just losers, that's it.

737
01:07:14,583 --> 01:07:17,511
No one is a loser here, Carla.
Not even you.

738
01:07:17,541 --> 01:07:19,499
Are you in a bad mood, honey?

739
01:07:19,916 --> 01:07:23,208
My student has dropped out of class.

740
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:28,083
What about you, Elisa? Were you able
to talk about it with your family?

741
01:07:28,458 --> 01:07:31,083
Alessio cannot accept it.

742
01:07:31,666 --> 01:07:33,958
And maybe I can't as well.

743
01:07:35,124 --> 01:07:37,833
But if I really have
only a few months left,

744
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:42,124
I can't waste time, I still have
a lot of things I want to do.

745
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,583
I have written them all down.

746
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:50,708
Maybe they are a bit too many,
but... I'm sure of some of them.

747
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:52,803
For example?

748
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:56,374
I want to give presents to my daughter
for her birthdays.

749
01:07:57,874 --> 01:08:02,303
Yes, I know it's a bit of a mess,
especially those for when she'd be older,

750
01:08:02,333 --> 01:08:05,583
but I thought maybe you could help me.

751
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,666
Who among you already has children...

752
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:21,719
-Don't you think it's a little early?
-After all, you just found out.

753
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:24,261
Girls, Elisa didn't ask us for an opinion.

754
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:27,469
It is her choice, and it's justifiable.

755
01:08:27,499 --> 01:08:30,333
Instead, she asked us for help, huh?

756
01:08:33,874 --> 01:08:36,136
In my will, I left everything to my cat.

757
01:08:36,166 --> 01:08:39,458
-To a cat!
-To a cat.

758
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:54,553
-Excuse me...
-Oh, Elisa. Good morning, tell me.

759
01:08:54,583 --> 01:08:57,886
I am looking for a person. She is
a patient who is hospitalized here.

760
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:00,249
I shouldn't...

761
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:02,386
Oh, well.

762
01:09:02,416 --> 01:09:05,761
-What's the name?
-Married name is Girotto.

763
01:09:05,791 --> 01:09:08,886
-Girotto...
-She was hospitalized on the 21.

764
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:12,749
Oh, ok. The 21...

765
01:09:34,833 --> 01:09:36,583
Hello.

766
01:09:49,124 --> 01:09:50,833
May I?

767
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:53,249
Come in.

768
01:09:57,874 --> 01:09:59,553
I've been to the hospital.

769
01:09:59,583 --> 01:10:02,219
I looked for you and they told me
that your mother is not there.

770
01:10:02,249 --> 01:10:04,333
That she never was,
that she doesn't exist.

771
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,374
Why did you look for me?

772
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:09,041
First, explain to me
why you're such a liar.

773
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:12,124
Where's your mother?

774
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:16,678
I never knew her.

775
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,594
She left when I was born.

776
01:10:18,624 --> 01:10:21,386
And your father?
Did you run away from home?

777
01:10:21,416 --> 01:10:24,374
-I told you, he's in Africa.
-Anna!

778
01:10:24,874 --> 01:10:27,594
Look, my dad is a loser, okay?

779
01:10:27,624 --> 01:10:30,083
We have nothing to say to each other.

780
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:32,303
Anyway, I can't go back to him.

781
01:10:32,333 --> 01:10:33,999
You ran away.

782
01:10:34,249 --> 01:10:36,249
Can you give me his number?
I want to talk to him.

783
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:38,916
So?

784
01:10:39,374 --> 01:10:42,291
-What's the problem?
-Forget it.

785
01:10:43,833 --> 01:10:45,303
ENGINEER BERRETTINI ARRESTED

786
01:10:45,333 --> 01:10:47,083
He is in prison.

787
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,416
That is the problem.

788
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:51,833
Wait up.

789
01:10:54,958 --> 01:10:56,541
I have a job for you.

790
01:11:01,749 --> 01:11:03,874
I'll personally hire you, this time.

791
01:11:05,458 --> 01:11:08,999
But no more lies,
no swearing and no controversies.

792
01:11:18,499 --> 01:11:20,303
What am I supposed to do?

793
01:11:20,333 --> 01:11:22,344
Help me choose the presents for her.

794
01:11:22,374 --> 01:11:24,136
-What?
-I didn't ask for your opinion!

795
01:11:24,166 --> 01:11:26,041
But why me?

796
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:28,541
You said she will never be like me.

797
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:34,333
Because I want someone who won't agree
with me just because I'm going to die.

798
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:42,083
So, will you help me?

799
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:21,083
These ones?

800
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:23,041
-Huh?
-Stop that.

801
01:12:23,874 --> 01:12:27,928
-What do you say?
-Nah. The drums are better.

802
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:30,844
-The drums?
-Yeah, the piano sucks.

803
01:12:30,874 --> 01:12:33,749
-The drums for a girl?
-So what?

804
01:12:36,791 --> 01:12:38,844
Enough! Enough!

805
01:12:38,874 --> 01:12:41,761
Give me those.
Poor Alessio! It's a torture.

806
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,136
As if the piano is not.

807
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,428
Hours alone in front
of that fucking keyboard

808
01:12:45,458 --> 01:12:47,719
while all her friends are outside playing.

809
01:12:47,749 --> 01:12:50,969
At the beginning you have to be dedicated,
then over time the passion comes.

810
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,303
At eight years old?

811
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:55,594
By the time that passion comes,
you have ruined her life.

812
01:12:55,624 --> 01:12:57,678
You say I have to give it to her
when she will be older?

813
01:12:57,708 --> 01:13:01,874
No! I say you have to get the drums.

814
01:13:03,499 --> 01:13:05,124
It is on sale, too.

815
01:13:08,541 --> 01:13:10,333
You convinced me, I'll get the drums.

816
01:13:18,374 --> 01:13:20,791
-I'll get the packages.
-Let's unload.

817
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,344
-Hello.
-Can I know where were you?

818
01:13:27,374 --> 01:13:29,219
Your cell phone is offline.

819
01:13:29,249 --> 01:13:31,469
Sorry, the battery died.

820
01:13:31,499 --> 01:13:33,678
They delivered a bicycle.

821
01:13:33,708 --> 01:13:37,386
We've been buying things for the baby.

822
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:39,041
Hi.

823
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:42,333
-What about her?
-She's helping me out.

824
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:44,541
-Can you help me?
-Yes.

825
01:13:44,583 --> 01:13:46,719
I've been trying to talk to you
since this morning.

826
01:13:46,749 --> 01:13:50,749
I managed to move up the appointment
at the hospital in Milan, it's tomorrow.

827
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:52,803
-Tomorrow?
-Tomorrow!

828
01:13:52,833 --> 01:13:54,303
Why, aren't you happy?

829
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:56,803
No, tomorrow I took an appointment
with the kindergarten director,

830
01:13:56,833 --> 01:14:00,219
-it's something I wanted to do with you.
-Elisa, why are you doing this?

831
01:14:00,249 --> 01:14:02,594
-What?
-You disappear, you go shopping,

832
01:14:02,624 --> 01:14:04,803
can't we face this thing together?

833
01:14:04,833 --> 01:14:06,761
-Do you really want to face it together?
-Sure.

834
01:14:06,791 --> 01:14:08,511
-Then help me.
-Am I not doing it?

835
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:10,136
No, you are not, Alessio.

836
01:14:10,166 --> 01:14:13,719
You talk about hospitals, doctors,
but I need to think about our future!

837
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:16,136
And how are you thinking about it,
by buying a fucking bicycle?

838
01:14:16,166 --> 01:14:18,999
When you have a better idea, let me know!

839
01:14:36,041 --> 01:14:37,958
Aren't you coming in for dinner?

840
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:41,916
No.

841
01:14:43,749 --> 01:14:45,458
You smoke?

842
01:14:46,999 --> 01:14:48,791
What do you think?

843
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:52,124
Can you give me a cigarette?

844
01:15:05,249 --> 01:15:06,874
How is she?

845
01:15:11,833 --> 01:15:13,624
She is not well.

846
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,916
But she's got balls.

847
01:15:17,124 --> 01:15:19,166
She's always had them.

848
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:22,749
After all, she is the strong one.

849
01:15:28,666 --> 01:15:31,499
We wanted this little girl so much.

850
01:15:32,041 --> 01:15:34,916
Next year we would have
gotten married, too.

851
01:15:36,874 --> 01:15:38,374
And then...

852
01:15:40,166 --> 01:15:42,499
when it gets this close...

853
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,791
I find myself alone.

854
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:50,124
You won't be alone.

855
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:53,583
Your will have your daughter.

856
01:15:55,249 --> 01:15:59,208
Can you picture me with a girl that small?

857
01:15:59,499 --> 01:16:01,333
What will I do?

858
01:16:02,041 --> 01:16:05,333
-Look, you're strong too.
-I don't think so.

859
01:16:07,749 --> 01:16:09,583
She told me.

860
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:12,541
Really?

861
01:16:12,874 --> 01:16:14,999
-Mm-hm.
-Did she say that to you?

862
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,333
More or less.

863
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:22,166
-But...
-But?

864
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:30,791
Show it to her, every now and then.

865

6 DIVING COURSE

867
01:16:49,624 --> 01:16:53,553
Yesterday I read
that there is a funeral agency

868
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:58,333
that transforms the ashes of cremations
into diamonds.

869
01:16:58,916 --> 01:17:01,874
-Yes, you can get yourself a ring...
-Yuck!

870
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,469
I already feel claustrophobic.

871
01:17:05,499 --> 01:17:11,928
14 MAKEUP AND PERFUMES 15 HI-FI SYSTEM
16 TENT AND SLEEPING BAG 17 LONDON TICKET

872
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:14,303
Okay, see you next Tuesday.

873
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:16,594
And don't forget to do your homework. Hm?

874
01:17:16,624 --> 01:17:18,678
All right.
-What homework?

875
01:17:18,708 --> 01:17:24,874
Smile to life, bullshit like that.
I have other priorities, God willing.

876
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:26,511
You don't know how many times
I've said to myself,

877
01:17:26,541 --> 01:17:30,124
"I'll take a six months leave of absence
and start studying English."

878
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:35,094
I don't want her to have this same regret.

879
01:17:35,124 --> 01:17:37,178
Here, you're a responsible mom.

880
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:39,636
If you want I can help you find a school!

881
01:17:39,666 --> 01:17:43,499
-I would be happy to contribute.
-I would like for you to teach her.

882
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:48,666
At 12 is fine, right? Or is it late?
Maybe at ten is better, what do you say?

883
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:51,053
Elisa, I don't even know
if I'll get to next year.

884
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,833
-Who says that?
-Listen to me carefully.

885
01:17:56,041 --> 01:17:57,999
You are a brave woman.

886
01:17:58,708 --> 01:18:00,208
Really.

887
01:18:01,999 --> 01:18:03,583
But I'm not.

888
01:18:05,166 --> 01:18:06,708
I'm sorry.

889
01:18:07,833 --> 01:18:10,583
So I'll give you the contacts
for that school then, huh?

890
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:12,833
Bye.

891
01:18:33,874 --> 01:18:37,749
<i>-What are you doing?</i>
<i>-What do you think?</i>

892
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:40,624
<i>It's dripping all over!</i>

893
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:44,541
<i>Like you can teach me.</i>

894
01:18:56,458 --> 01:18:58,041
Hey.

895
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:01,083
It's not finished yet.

896
01:19:01,458 --> 01:19:03,833
We have to apply the second coat.

897
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:09,499
Listen, where did you want to place this?

898
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:14,666
Because I thought... I don't know,
we could put it there, too.

899
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:17,499
What's up?

900
01:19:20,708 --> 01:19:25,083
No, come on, you'll get all dirty
with paint! You'll get dirty...

901
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:34,999
Thank you, my love.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

902
01:19:35,124 --> 01:19:36,803
Do you like it?

903
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,833
There's still one coat to be done.

904
01:19:39,041 --> 01:19:40,969
No, hey! Hey!

905
01:19:40,999 --> 01:19:45,999
Anna is here!
Come on, you'll get all dirty!

906
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,511
How is she?

907
01:21:06,541 --> 01:21:10,416
She suffered a severe concussion,
we induced her a pharmacological coma.

908
01:21:10,916 --> 01:21:12,136
A coma?

909
01:21:12,166 --> 01:21:16,469
Don't worry, it's just a precautionary
measure to reduce brain stress.

910
01:21:16,499 --> 01:21:17,969
But she is reacting well.

911
01:21:17,999 --> 01:21:22,124
If the tests are positive,
we will wake her up soon.

912
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,469
Hey, where were you?

913
01:21:41,499 --> 01:21:44,499
Hey, slow down!

914
01:21:45,291 --> 01:21:47,624
What is it? Is everything all right?

915
01:21:48,333 --> 01:21:50,083
I'm okay, now.

916
01:21:54,999 --> 01:21:57,041
But... How far along are you?

917
01:21:57,666 --> 01:22:00,458
I'm eight months pregnant, you know that.

918
01:22:02,124 --> 01:22:03,761
Eight months?

919
01:22:03,791 --> 01:22:05,678
Anna, are you sure you're okay?

920
01:22:05,708 --> 01:22:08,874
What about a hair straightener? Hm?
I would like it.

921
01:22:09,416 --> 01:22:11,041
Mm, I don't know.

922
01:22:11,374 --> 01:22:13,511
What does "mm, I don't know" mean?

923
01:22:13,541 --> 01:22:17,166
It is the last present,
it must be something special.

924
01:22:17,249 --> 01:22:19,791
This way, honey, you will never find it.

925
01:22:19,833 --> 01:22:22,178
And you? What do you say?

926
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:25,416
What could she gift her
for her 18th birthday?

927
01:22:26,124 --> 01:22:29,791
Anna, can you pass me that green jar?

928
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:32,291
-This one?
-Yes.

929
01:22:34,541 --> 01:22:36,041
Thank you.

930
01:22:39,833 --> 01:22:43,344
-It's bitter. What is that?
-It is my secret ingredient.

931
01:22:43,374 --> 01:22:45,136
<i>How much stuff did you bring...</i>

932
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:48,344
-I think your parents have arrived.
-I think so, too.

933
01:22:48,374 --> 01:22:49,678
They are a piece of work.

934
01:22:49,708 --> 01:22:50,969
<i>I suffer from sciatica!</i>

935
01:22:50,999 --> 01:22:52,344
Are they arguing?

936
01:22:52,374 --> 01:22:55,791
Mainly it's just your mother
chewing out your father.

937
01:22:55,916 --> 01:22:58,333
I'm going to help them with the bags.

938
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:00,969
Can you see if the oil is frying?

939
01:23:00,999 --> 01:23:02,583
Sure.

940
01:23:03,999 --> 01:23:05,499
Yes.

941
01:23:06,791 --> 01:23:10,166
-Now we have to fry them.
-Wait, I'll help you.

942
01:23:11,874 --> 01:23:14,124
Oh! It's heavy.

943
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,874
Try it yourself.

944
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:21,708
It's not... it's not difficult.

945
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:25,541
You take an apple...

946
01:23:26,416 --> 01:23:28,344
pass it in the dough,

947
01:23:28,374 --> 01:23:32,291
on one side and then the other,
you let it drip...

948
01:23:32,916 --> 01:23:35,124
and you put it in the oil.

949
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:37,499
Like this.

950
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:45,374
One, two.

951
01:23:49,666 --> 01:23:52,541
In the oil.
Be careful not to burn yourself.

952
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:07,416
You take an apple...

953
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:11,041
pass it in the dough...

954
01:24:13,124 --> 01:24:15,541
and then you put it in the oil.

955
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:18,541
Like this.

956
01:24:23,208 --> 01:24:25,166
You take an apple...

957
01:24:27,124 --> 01:24:30,041
Oh! You have to let it drip. Here.

958
01:24:30,291 --> 01:24:32,386
And then you put it in the oil.

959
01:24:32,416 --> 01:24:34,041
Like this.

960
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:47,886
Here we are!

961
01:24:47,916 --> 01:24:50,916
-Can we?
-Mom, we are here.

962
01:24:54,541 --> 01:24:56,636
What were you arguing about, huh?

963
01:24:56,666 --> 01:24:59,969
Arguing, us? Never!

964
01:24:59,999 --> 01:25:03,219
-You make me feel worse.
-See? Are you happy?

965
01:25:03,249 --> 01:25:06,041
-Me?
-I am Teresa, it's a pleasure.

966
01:25:06,416 --> 01:25:11,041
-She is Anna.
-I am Alberto, Teresa's husband.

967
01:25:11,249 --> 01:25:13,011
Here I am.

968
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:16,594
And we will drink this tonight!

969
01:25:16,624 --> 01:25:21,344
No, we will drink this,
because you are leaving tonight,

970
01:25:21,374 --> 01:25:26,761
-you cannot sleep with the bride.
-I know, I know.

971
01:25:26,791 --> 01:25:28,499
The bride?

972
01:25:29,583 --> 01:25:30,636
What does that mean?

973
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:33,553
You young people
don't understand these things.

974
01:25:33,583 --> 01:25:36,803
But in our family, there is no way
that the future bride and groom

975
01:25:36,833 --> 01:25:40,416
sleep in the same bed
the night before the wedding.

976
01:25:44,208 --> 01:25:46,208
Hurray for the newlyweds!

977
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:50,791
Shall we go in?

978
01:26:00,541 --> 01:26:04,053
Sorry, I'm a little nervous.

979
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:08,386
Also because, after forty years, my wife
has given me the floor

980
01:26:08,416 --> 01:26:12,624
and I no longer know how to do it.
Even if...

981
01:26:12,666 --> 01:26:17,094
General Dalla Paglia
knew how to speak to the troops!

982
01:26:17,124 --> 01:26:20,594
Ohi ohi, he's back to the African War.

983
01:26:20,624 --> 01:26:23,344
When you were born, Elisa,

984
01:26:23,374 --> 01:26:28,469
I was 26 years old and I felt like
I had understood everything already.

985
01:26:28,499 --> 01:26:33,219
But, instead, you taught us

986
01:26:33,249 --> 01:26:37,386
and you keep teaching us many things.

987
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:40,041
Your Mom and I...

988
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:43,583
We love you very much.

989
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:48,844
It's... It's something we never tell you,

990
01:26:48,874 --> 01:26:53,969
because we're not exactly
effusive in the family.

991
01:26:53,999 --> 01:26:56,708
We are a family of toads,

992
01:26:57,666 --> 01:27:02,511
but you know it well
that we love you madly

993
01:27:02,541 --> 01:27:07,083
and we will always love you.
Congratulations, my dear.

994
01:27:07,874 --> 01:27:10,594
Best wishes to you too, Alessio.

995
01:27:10,624 --> 01:27:15,291
Believe me,
you are the luckiest person on Earth.

996
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:17,333
Bravo!

997
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:25,344
Sorry, a moment of attention, please.
I wanted to say a couple of things.

998
01:27:25,374 --> 01:27:27,511
Elisa, Alessio,
I promise I will be harmless.

999
01:27:27,541 --> 01:27:29,094
More or less.

1000
01:27:29,124 --> 01:27:33,083
I wanted to raise
my second glass of wine to...

1001
01:27:33,416 --> 01:27:35,094
to this couple,

1002
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:40,553
to this... enterprise for your tenacity,
determination and love.

1003
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:44,011
Thank you for including me in your family,
you are the closest thing to monogamy

1004
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:46,219
that has ever happened
to me in my whole life.

1005
01:27:46,249 --> 01:27:48,624
And I promise it will remain the only one.

1006
01:27:49,874 --> 01:27:53,416
So let's dance, let's drink,
let's all love each other.

1007
01:27:54,083 --> 01:27:55,636
Hurray for the newlyweds!

1008
01:27:55,666 --> 01:27:57,583
-Yay!
-Bravo!

1009
01:29:27,083 --> 01:29:29,083
What happened?

1010
01:29:29,999 --> 01:29:31,428
I got it all stained.

1011
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,583
How did you do that?

1012
01:29:33,666 --> 01:29:35,666
It's just a little bit of blood.

1013
01:29:36,833 --> 01:29:38,874
I need to lie down.

1014
01:29:40,499 --> 01:29:42,583
-I'll come with you.
-Yes.

1015
01:29:48,083 --> 01:29:52,208
<i>The memories:</i>
<i>1. You will always have them,</i>

1016
01:29:52,541 --> 01:29:56,749
<i>2. They make you long for the past,</i>
<i>3. You cling to them when you feel down,</i>

1017
01:29:56,958 --> 01:30:00,469
<i>-4. They prepare the future.</i>
<i>-They prepare the future.</i>

1018
01:30:00,499 --> 01:30:02,124
<i>Okay.</i>

1019
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:06,219
Your favorite dress is now worn out:
1. You buy a similar one,

1020
01:30:06,249 --> 01:30:10,249
<i>2. You long for the great moments</i>
<i>you lived in that dress,</i>

1021
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:13,094
<i>3. You have it repaired by a seamstress.</i>

1022
01:30:13,124 --> 01:30:15,999
-I have it repaired by a seamstress.
-Okay.

1023
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:17,886
I can't take another hour of this.

1024
01:30:17,916 --> 01:30:21,249
Come on, focus. We have to finish this.

1025
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,624
So...

1026
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,636
Faced with an unexpected event:

1027
01:30:26,666 --> 01:30:28,594
1. You always know how to manage,

1028
01:30:28,624 --> 01:30:31,178
2. It is better to ask for help
from someone more expert than you,

1029
01:30:31,208 --> 01:30:34,553
3. It is the fault of those who have not
done things well, they should fix them.

1030
01:30:34,583 --> 01:30:36,166
The second one.

1031
01:30:37,291 --> 01:30:40,136
You ask for help? No way! No.

1032
01:30:40,166 --> 01:30:42,344
You, the first one.
"You always know how to manage".

1033
01:30:42,374 --> 01:30:44,041
I wish.

1034
01:30:44,458 --> 01:30:46,124
And you?

1035
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:49,541
-The third one, I think.
-How was it?

1036
01:30:49,708 --> 01:30:52,958
"It is the fault of those who have not
done things well, they should fix them."

1037
01:30:55,374 --> 01:30:58,458
-What will you do afterwards?
-What?

1038
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,124
Afterwards.

1039
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,583
After I'm gone.

1040
01:31:09,208 --> 01:31:11,499
What will you do,
have you thought about it?

1041
01:31:15,416 --> 01:31:17,374
Come on, there's only one left.

1042
01:31:17,749 --> 01:31:19,136
-You realize you...
-I thought about it,

1043
01:31:19,166 --> 01:31:22,678
you could you keep working for me, hm?

1044
01:31:22,708 --> 01:31:24,624
You could give her the presents.

1045
01:31:25,124 --> 01:31:27,166
So you can explain everything to her.

1046
01:31:28,166 --> 01:31:29,708
Why not?

1047
01:31:37,124 --> 01:31:39,833
Because maybe you will give them to her.

1048
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:43,791
Because I always know
how to manage, right?

1049
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:51,999
Meanwhile, let's hear
what doctors say today.

1050
01:31:56,499 --> 01:32:00,333
<i>Anyway, I've decided what to give her</i>
<i>for her eighteenth birthday.</i>

1051
01:32:01,291 --> 01:32:03,041
Do you want to know?

1052
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,749
How beautiful.

1053
01:32:31,416 --> 01:32:32,916
What's up?

1054
01:32:34,666 --> 01:32:36,624
You don't like it?

1055
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:41,958
Is that eighteen years from now
it will be out of fashion.

1056
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:45,499
Oh, well...

1057
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:50,499
This way at her party
she will be the most original of all.

1058
01:32:51,208 --> 01:32:52,833
Which party?

1059
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:57,041
-She won't be having a party.
-Why?

1060
01:32:58,916 --> 01:33:00,624
Never mind.

1061
01:33:03,999 --> 01:33:07,583
This presents thing has always seemed
silly to you, didn't it?

1062
01:33:09,624 --> 01:33:11,344
You did it only because
you felt sorry for me.

1063
01:33:11,374 --> 01:33:12,916
It is not so.

1064
01:33:13,458 --> 01:33:15,124
Why, then?

1065
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:20,166
Because I'm your daughter.

1066
01:33:22,624 --> 01:33:24,708
It's not funny.

1067
01:33:28,124 --> 01:33:29,958
It isn't fun for me either.

1068
01:34:00,874 --> 01:34:02,916
Is that really you?

1069
01:34:13,583 --> 01:34:15,249
Anna.

1070
01:34:20,624 --> 01:34:22,803
I'm sorry, are you done?

1071
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:24,458
One moment.

1072
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:33,333
What is it, are you afraid that you don't
get into that fucking dress anymore?

1073
01:34:33,874 --> 01:34:36,624
Hey! What's going on?

1074
01:34:37,708 --> 01:34:44,166
Mom? Mom! Mom!

1075
01:34:44,833 --> 01:34:48,041
<i>-Ma'am? Ma'am?</i>
<i>-Help...</i>

1076
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,469
-Come on, Mom...
-Help!

1077
01:34:50,499 --> 01:34:53,458
Call an ambulance!

1078
01:35:18,499 --> 01:35:19,886
You can't come.

1079
01:35:19,916 --> 01:35:21,458
But...

1080
01:35:23,041 --> 01:35:24,791
Mom!

1081
01:35:25,749 --> 01:35:30,041
Mom!

1082
01:35:53,499 --> 01:35:54,999
Open up.

1083
01:35:57,416 --> 01:35:58,916
What?

1084
01:35:59,249 --> 01:36:01,416
The door, she's knocking.

1085
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:05,874
Who are you talking about?

1086
01:36:06,624 --> 01:36:10,541
The girl I ran over. Anna.
She is our daughter.

1087
01:36:12,374 --> 01:36:13,874
Baby...

1088
01:36:16,041 --> 01:36:17,541
You've been dreaming.

1089
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:21,303
You dreamed it was her.

1090
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:23,428
She's knocking, can't you hear the noise?

1091
01:36:23,458 --> 01:36:27,333
Elisa... it was a dream.

1092
01:36:29,499 --> 01:36:31,458
The noise is that thing over there.

1093
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:49,499
How was she like?

1094
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:53,541
Our daughter. How was she?

1095
01:36:55,958 --> 01:37:00,124
-She was beautiful.
-Like you, then.

1096
01:37:06,041 --> 01:37:09,583
She had... dark hair

1097
01:37:10,291 --> 01:37:12,083
and light blue eyes.

1098
01:37:12,749 --> 01:37:15,333
Deep and very sweet.

1099
01:37:19,499 --> 01:37:21,249
What size did she wear?

1100
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:23,916
Why do you ask that?

1101
01:37:26,249 --> 01:37:27,916
I got the present.

1102
01:37:28,916 --> 01:37:31,541
The dress for her 18th birthday party.

1103
01:37:32,041 --> 01:37:33,916
The one you wanted.

1104
01:37:34,374 --> 01:37:38,541
I got a size 4, what do you say?

1105
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:43,136
No, it's not good, take it back.

1106
01:37:43,166 --> 01:37:44,303
Why?

1107
01:37:44,333 --> 01:37:46,041
Because.

1108
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:51,219
Eighteen years from now it will be
out of fashion. I need something else.

1109
01:37:51,249 --> 01:37:52,749
Calm down.

1110
01:37:53,374 --> 01:37:56,386
-Where's my notebook?
-Elisa. Hey. Calm down.

1111
01:37:56,416 --> 01:37:58,053
-Take my notebook. Take it.
-Look,

1112
01:37:58,083 --> 01:38:01,416
the doctor said you need to stay calm.

1113
01:38:03,041 --> 01:38:04,219
You'll give birth today.

1114
01:38:04,249 --> 01:38:06,291
Today? Why today?

1115
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,833
Is there any problem?

1116
01:38:09,624 --> 01:38:13,208
Good morning, Anna.
Your Dad came to get you.

1117
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:19,749
-How are you today?
-I'm better.

1118
01:38:21,833 --> 01:38:23,916
I brought you some clothes.

1119
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:27,886
I... I got jeans, are they okay?

1120
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:29,583
Yes, they are fine.

1121
01:38:35,833 --> 01:38:37,541
-Dad?
-Yeah?

1122
01:38:43,999 --> 01:38:45,791
I'm sorry.

1123
01:39:00,416 --> 01:39:03,469
Oh, sweetheart, welcome back!

1124
01:39:03,499 --> 01:39:05,874
Let me hug you!

1125
01:39:06,999 --> 01:39:08,678
-Welcome back.
-Grandpa!

1126
01:39:08,708 --> 01:39:10,583
What did I tell you...

1127
01:39:10,708 --> 01:39:13,791
Oh, sweetheart.

1128
01:39:16,499 --> 01:39:18,136
-Have you been arguing?
-Yes.

1129
01:39:18,166 --> 01:39:20,719
No, I told him to remove
the garlands, but he...

1130
01:39:20,749 --> 01:39:23,803
-No, leave them, they are cute.
-See?

1131
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:26,208
Come here, you little monkey!

1132
01:39:27,916 --> 01:39:29,541
I missed you.

1133
01:39:29,874 --> 01:39:31,374
I missed you too.

1134
01:39:38,833 --> 01:39:40,833
I'm gonna finish cooking.

1135
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:52,291
So?

1136
01:40:54,041 --> 01:40:55,666
Are you ready?

1137
01:40:57,291 --> 01:41:00,833
-You look so good.
-Thank you.

1138
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:04,844
-Have you already picked up someone?
-Obviously.

1139
01:41:04,874 --> 01:41:07,719
You, instead, will have to
"close shop" for a while, mh?

1140
01:41:07,749 --> 01:41:10,249
-Right, Alessio?
-Yes...

1141
01:41:14,374 --> 01:41:16,041
You can count on me.

1142
01:41:17,208 --> 01:41:18,749
For English.

1143
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:22,374
I knew you would make it.

1144
01:41:25,208 --> 01:41:27,041
She will hate me...

1145
01:41:27,791 --> 01:41:29,719
You're making me the English teacher.

1146
01:41:29,749 --> 01:41:32,708
No, you are impossible to hate.

1147
01:41:34,041 --> 01:41:36,249
That's why I chose you.

1148
01:41:36,833 --> 01:41:39,678
I am sorry. You have to clear the room.

1149
01:41:39,708 --> 01:41:41,291
Yes.

1150
01:41:55,499 --> 01:41:57,541
Bon voyage.

1151
01:42:04,999 --> 01:42:07,708
Don't worry, honey, okay?

1152
01:42:08,374 --> 01:42:10,083
Sorry.

1153
01:42:17,708 --> 01:42:19,011
You cannot enter.

1154
01:42:19,041 --> 01:42:20,844
See you later, huh?

1155
01:42:20,874 --> 01:42:23,333
-We did good, didn't we?
-Yes.

1156
01:42:31,624 --> 01:42:33,166
Yes.

1157
01:42:34,583 --> 01:42:36,624
We did good.

1158
01:42:40,624 --> 01:42:42,374
Here she is.

1159
01:42:44,041 --> 01:42:45,791
Here we go.

1160
01:42:48,249 --> 01:42:49,916
Like so.

1161
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:53,833
Elisa, let's sit down for a moment, okay?

1162
01:42:53,916 --> 01:42:56,624
Good. Very good.

1163
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:58,624
Are you ready?

1164
01:43:03,666 --> 01:43:08,791
Now let's do an injection,
so the baby girl is more relaxed, too.

1165
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:12,053
Will you put me to sleep?

1166
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:15,928
-Yes, but only from the belly down.
-But I want to see her.

1167
01:43:15,958 --> 01:43:17,303
Of course you will see her.

1168
01:43:17,333 --> 01:43:20,333
The important thing now
is that you don't get agitated.

1169
01:43:34,499 --> 01:43:35,999
We are ready.

1170
01:43:38,208 --> 01:43:40,541
Can I have pen and paper?

1171
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:42,916
-Now?
-Yes.

1172
01:43:43,749 --> 01:43:45,374
It's important.

1173
01:43:45,666 --> 01:43:47,208
Doctor?

1174
01:43:48,041 --> 01:43:51,374
-Elisa, what is it?
-I have to write something.

1175
01:43:51,916 --> 01:43:55,249
-Can't we do it later?
-No. Now it's better.

1176
01:44:00,999 --> 01:44:02,499
All right.

1177
01:45:05,833 --> 01:45:10,291
<i>Dear Anna, my head is full of thoughts.</i>

1178
01:45:11,083 --> 01:45:13,458
<i>I would like to tell you many things.</i>

1179
01:45:14,208 --> 01:45:16,416
<i>How life is and how</i>
<i>it should be dealt with.</i>

1180
01:45:17,208 --> 01:45:20,124
<i>I would like to transfer to you my way</i>
<i>of doing and of thinking.</i>

1181
01:45:21,374 --> 01:45:25,458
<i>Be by your side,</i>
<i>in good times and bad times.</i>

1182
01:45:26,666 --> 01:45:30,833
<i>But I can't, fate has decided so.</i>

1183
01:45:32,874 --> 01:45:35,124
<i>Maybe you're angry now.</i>

1184
01:45:35,166 --> 01:45:38,624
<i>You are wondering why, why you.</i>

1185
01:45:39,249 --> 01:45:42,499
<i>Well, know that I ask myself that too,</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

1186
01:45:44,749 --> 01:45:49,291
<i>There is not a reason. There is only life.</i>

1187
01:45:49,333 --> 01:45:53,708
<i>And believe me, it's not worth living it</i>
<i>being angry or sad,</i>

1188
01:45:54,416 --> 01:45:57,011
<i>even only because you're more beautiful</i>
<i>when you laugh, I'm sure.</i>

1189
01:45:57,041 --> 01:45:59,499
Where are you running to?

1190
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:01,708
<i>This is my last present.</i>

1191
01:46:03,416 --> 01:46:06,136
<i>This morning I dreamed</i>
<i>that we cooked them together.</i>

1192
01:46:06,166 --> 01:46:08,844
MOM'S FRIED APPLES

1193
01:46:08,874 --> 01:46:10,666
<i>I hope you like it.</i>

1194
01:46:10,999 --> 01:46:14,708
<i>They just need a pinch</i>
<i>of love, but you will add that.</i>

1195
01:46:15,833 --> 01:46:20,249
<i>I know, you must be thinking,</i>
<i>"Still with these presents, what a drag!"</i>

1196
01:46:21,124 --> 01:46:23,428
<i>But you don't know how</i>
<i>this has done me good,</i>

1197
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:25,928
<i>how much strength it has given me</i>
<i>to think about them.</i>

1198
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:27,053
<i>To think about you.</i>

1199
01:46:27,083 --> 01:46:30,124
<i>About what would help you</i>
<i>become a better person.</i>

1200
01:46:32,249 --> 01:46:34,291
<i>So thank you, my baby.</i>

1201
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:37,261
<i>Sorry if maybe I got some presents wrong,</i>

1202
01:46:37,291 --> 01:46:41,541
<i>but it was the only way I had</i>
<i>to feel closer to you.</i>

1203
01:46:44,208 --> 01:46:46,083
<i>Now I have to leave you.</i>

1204
01:46:46,208 --> 01:46:50,166
<i>You have become a woman now,</i>
<i>and you no longer need my presents.</i>

1205
01:46:50,499 --> 01:46:54,624
<i>But remember, even on the brightest day,</i>

1206
01:46:54,999 --> 01:46:56,999
<i>you can see my star.</i>

1207
01:46:58,666 --> 01:47:00,666
<i>I love you madly.</i>

1208
01:47:02,249 --> 01:47:05,249
<i>Elisa. Your mom.</i>

1209
01:47:05,374 --> 01:47:07,208
I'm ready.

1210
01:48:59,666 --> 01:49:01,333
Hello.

1211
01:49:06,666 --> 01:49:08,166
Hello.

1212
01:49:33,083 --> 01:49:35,249
-Anna?
-Come in.

1213
01:49:40,166 --> 01:49:41,749
My present.

1214
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:45,624
I mean, mine...
It was actually your mom's first idea.

1215
01:49:45,874 --> 01:49:47,844
She had had second thoughts about it,

1216
01:49:47,874 --> 01:49:51,958
but that at the time I didn't feel like
returning it, you know.

1217
01:50:00,916 --> 01:50:02,499
Do you like it?

1218
01:50:03,249 --> 01:50:04,803
It's beautiful.

1219
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:08,666
-Maybe now it will be out of fashion.
-It doesn't matter.

1220
01:50:10,041 --> 01:50:14,291
Try it on though, because at the time,
me and sizes were not really--

1221
01:50:14,958 --> 01:50:16,708
Hey.

1222
01:50:20,249 --> 01:50:21,833
Thank you.

1223
01:50:22,666 --> 01:50:24,708
-I'll wait for you downstairs.
-Mm-hm.

1224
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:30,291
-A lot of people came.
-I'm coming.

1225
01:50:44,208 --> 01:50:46,666
<i>Do you have a decent pair of shoes?</i>

1226
