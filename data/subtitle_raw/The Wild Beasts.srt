We are closing. The public
is kindly requested to leave.

2
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,662
Last call.

3
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:48,377
We are closing. 777B public
is kindly requested to leave.

4
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:36,777
- Wait, I'll help you.
- Yes... Thanks.

5
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,611
- Good day, Doctor.
- Hello Kurt.

6
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,280
- Dr. Schwarz.
- Hello.

7
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,282
- Doctor.
- Hi Miller.

8
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:43,824
Good evening, Dr. Krader.

9
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,984
How is your symphony for
orchestra and animals coming along?

10
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:49,247
Pretty good.

11
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:52,417
- The work is slow-going.
- You work too much.

12
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,072
You're Dr. Schwarz, right?

13
00:04:54,114 --> 00:04:56,421
Yes, it's me. Have you
come up with a title?

14
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:01,843
Yes, I was thinking about
something like "Nature Weeps".

15
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,429
- You like it?
- "Nature Weeps"...

16
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:08,308
Don't you think it's a
little creepy as a title?

17
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,519
- Bye.
- Have fun.

18
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,437
Good evening.

19
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,278
Go, Brek.

20
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,605
- Watch out!
- Oh, my God! What's the matter?

21
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,695
Careful.

22
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,742
These new cages are a drag.

23
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:12,747
- Excuse me, Fritz, will you open it?
- At your service, Doctor.

24
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,583
And kill that damn siren.

25
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,752
- You're free to go.
- Thanks.

26
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:21,089
Look who's coming.

27
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,218
Hey Gladis... Be a good girl. Stay calm.

28
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,764
Calm down. You don't
like being pricked, right?

29
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,685
That's it. Be good, girl.
"Good girl, good girl."

30
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:38,189
You're real good. Walk over
there. Wait for me, huh? Good...

31
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:42,068
Go! Pass me the syringe.

32
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,655
Alright, are you ready, Gladis?

33
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,867
Come on, easy.

34
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:52,287
With that big fur of yours,
you won't feel a thing.

35
00:06:55,582 --> 00:07:00,837
That's it... Be good,
Gladis... Easy... Easy.

36
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:05,216
Here we go. You see?
You didn't even feel it.

37
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,345
- Feeling better now, Miss?
- Yes.

38
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:10,597
Danger's over.

39
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,076
- Take your picture now, Laura.
- Yes!

40
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:36,206
Be quick. And there she goes...

41
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,460
Five seconds to go.

42
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,171
What's wrong with her? Does she feel bad?

43
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:43,851
Rip!

44
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:47,050
No, she's alright.
It's a normal reaction.

45
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:51,179
She's taking a nice trip
to the land of dreams.

46
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:57,060
He's bitten her nipples bloody.
That's why she behaved so crazy.

47
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:02,941
- Crazy indeed, she ate her babies.
- Well, luckily not all of them.

48
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:08,238
There's still this little witch
here. Listen to how she growls.

49
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,657
The little bastard...

50
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,327
You want to see her?

51
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,207
Look who bit her mother
instead of sucking the milk.

52
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:23,378
- Easy does it.
- Take her to the second ward.

53
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,629
A little higher.

54
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,383
What a little beast!

55
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:31,094
Look how she bites.

56
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,264
Don't do that.

57
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,142
Alright, I'll see you at the lab.

58
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,898
Just a moment, I'm coming!

59
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,502
It's 7:30 a. m. I left you some
hamburgers in the kitchen.

60
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,504
I'm coming! One moment!

61
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,758
Take a shower, but don't
flood the entire house, alright?

62
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,844
Put on the striped
jeans because didn't...

63
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:20,018
Dr. Schwarz, it's 6:30 pm. This
is the last bulletin from solitude.

64
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,772
Helga's out. I'm putting on
my jeans, and will leave as well.

65
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,064
I'm going to dancing lessons with Tommy.

66
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:30,612
Hear that ringing? Will you
stop that noise? I'm coming!

67
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,864
I listened to your message.

68
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:37,744
Thank you so much for reminding
me to eat, to dress, to wash...

69
00:09:38,036 --> 00:09:41,664
Mom, ł just wouldn't know
what I'd do without you.

70
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,210
But where the hell did
you stash my Ba-Ba-Ba?

71
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,504
Here he is.

72
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,885
Malta called from the newspaper.

73
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:59,057
She wanted... Yes, she basically
wants you to call her before 5:00 pm.

74
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,768
But since it's already past 6:00 pm...

75
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,105
Oh well, like I said, we're used to it.

76
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,108
End of message. Signed,
your daughter Susy.

77
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,694
That girl with the brown curls, remember?

78
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:17,408
I'm coming, you ball-buster!

79
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,388
Come on, move, Brek.

80
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,723
You're strange tonight. What's up?

81
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,728
Don't make me drag you. Will you
walk? What's gotten into you, Brek?

82
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:50,024
Brek! Walk! What did you see tonight?

83
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,360
Brek! Come on, walk!

84
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,195
Be good. Be good!

85
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,948
Come on, let's go!

86
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,254
- What's wrong?
- Did you see that guy?

87
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,633
- I don't know, I had a strange feeling.
- Come on...

88
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,170
Don't tell me a guy like him worries you.

89
00:11:18,212 --> 00:11:20,555
He's just blind. What's
he supposed to do?

90
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:25,518
Come back down. I'd like to
tell you a story only I know about.

91
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,271
You're so stupid!

92
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:35,737
- Does your story have a happy ending?
- Yes, very happy...

93
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,323
So let's begin with the end.

94
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,876
I think it's a story like any other.

95
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:53,171
- You want to know how it ends?
- Oh yes, please...

96
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:24,332
She's not home. She could have at
least turned on the answering machine.

97
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,121
- She does that on purpose.
- But no, she's probably just forgotten.

98
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,456
I don't think so.

99
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,148
That plague doesn't do
anything without a reason.

100
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,211
- I'm telling you, she did it on purpose.
- You know her better than I do.

101
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,548
She's your daughter. Honey
Pie, is your colic better?

102
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,886
You're good - unlike the lady's daughter.

103
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:41,093
Thanks for the "lady".

104
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,430
Who wrote that children are aliens
who come from another world...

105
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,685
to destroy the one of their
parents? Aldrich? Huh?

106
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,687
An insinuation?

107
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,898
You too were at war
with your mother, huh?

108
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,110
Don't you know that mothers
have to be respected?

109
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,612
Mothers are dangerous, very dangerous.

110
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,004
The company of the
owls doesn't become you.

111
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,991
- You hear that?
- You're snippy like them.

112
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,493
- You're not snippy.
- According to you, I'm a bad mother?

113
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:09,027
- You're good.
- I have to clear up the situation.

114
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,247
You know what I'll do?

115
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,126
Congress or not, I'll
pick her up at school.

116
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:17,755
- The time has come for a long chat.
- The mothers...

117
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:24,470
Speaking of which, hers would have
eaten her if we hadn't been there in time.

118
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:28,725
If we hadn't removed her, we'd
have another mom guilty of infanticide.

119
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,853
The mothers have decided
to stop being mommies...

120
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,522
and only think about their jobs.

121
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:37,414
Is it my fault that I don't
have enough time for her?

122
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,153
I have to earn our bread and butter.

123
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:48,119
Become mine, doll, make me happy, and
you won't have to worry about anything.

124
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,041
And become your private whore, doctor?

125
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,461
And also your secretary
and your cook, right?

126
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,422
And God knows what else
you got in your macho mind.

127
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:03,009
Well, little miss, why are you
so bad to your mother, huh?

128
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,637
Because her cannibal
mother ate her siblings.

129
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:13,519
Kidding aside, isn't it strange? From
a naturalistic perspective, I mean.

130
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,230
The survival of the species
and the maternal instinct...

131
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,815
Once upon a time maybe.

132
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:23,529
But not these days - strange things
have happened around here lately.

133
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,866
Well, why did you stop?

134
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,119
Keep talking. This day
might not be wasted after all.

135
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,161
I might be a failure as a mother...

136
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,334
but as a journalist I could
write a most interesting article.

137
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:41,339
What would you say if I'd call the article
"The dangerous madness of the zoo"?

138
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:45,131
Can you imagine? Or maybe I could
steal the title of Krader's symphony.

139
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:48,429
It's very impressive: "Nature Weeps".

140
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,484
Not like that, it hurts.

141
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:18,418
- Did you hear? What was that?
- What do you mean?

142
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,586
Now come on...

143
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,273
No...

144
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,034
- They're rats! Rats! Belt!
- Wait!

145
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,411
- Help me, Belt, do something!
- Let me see!

146
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,165
- Let's get out! Help!
- No, don't open it!

147
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,169
- There are thousands out there!
- Do something! Please do something!

148
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,795
No!

149
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:14,348
- Go away! Get lost!
- Go, get out!

150
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,020
No, help! Belt, help me! No!

151
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,135
- At 7:00 pm. then.
- Alright.

152
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,262
Thanks a lot.

153
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,824
Oh, Rip, you're as stubborn,
ponderous and lazy as a sloth.

154
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,868
Don't you want to change your mind?

155
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,456
Impossible, I want to
finish that taxidermy work.

156
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,751
And you know that I
can't stand these meetings.

157
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,462
I'm a doer, Laura,
not a thinker like you.

158
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,383
All those strange intellectual
acrobatics on Darwin, Lamark...

159
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:33,844
and other "holy fossils" shorten my life.

160
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,723
Well, I wouldn't want to
taint myself with such a crime.

161
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:42,061
- Bye, you "doer".
- Hey, didn't you forget something?

162
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:43,980
Goodb...

163
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:50,361
Hey, with another kiss like
that you will shorten my life.

164
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,281
I suggest you take a
nice cold shower, tiger.

165
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:59,537
- Didn't you feel like you were on fire?
- No, I just smelled the stink of Gladis.

166
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,959
Laura? Will you come
to my place tomorrow?

167
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,544
Everything's possible.
But I'll call you first.

168
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,755
I count on it, huh!

169
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,348
Queen of Hearts... Here we go!

170
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,187
It's all over, you're finished.
Over and out, grandpa!

171
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:30,359
How could I concentrate on the
game with all that noise in my ears?

172
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,240
My dear grandpa, live and let live.

173
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,368
Bullshit! That's just bullshit!

174
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,456
It's all useless gimmicks. Just
rubbish like that stuff over here.

175
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:48,294
Big buttons, small buttons, big levers,
small levers, lights and little lights.

176
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,631
Automation, they
call it. I call it bullshit!

177
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,508
It's only good to rid
people of their jobs!

178
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,886
But which jobs? What people do you mean?

179
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,428
There's never enough
staff around here anyway.

180
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,931
Where are you going now?

181
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:04,310
Trying to find Kurt and Miller.
They're better off than I am.

182
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:07,271
At least they have animals as friends.

183
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,564
Bye-bye.

184
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:12,693
Speaking of animals... Look
here. Check out this pretty piggy.

185
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,905
- Nice teats.
- What the hell is that?

186
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,660
- It's in section 4.
- The cat area!

187
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,828
But what the hell happened?

188
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,872
It's the tiger cages.

189
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:28,167
Look at their movements.
Maybe an earthquake.

190
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:31,128
They're acting strange.
But here everything's okay.

191
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,173
They say animals sense
them long before we do.

192
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,926
I'll take a look at it.

193
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,806
- Have you seen my torch?
- It's on the table.

194
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:45,393
It looks like someone's
trying to open the cages.

195
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,746
Hey pascha! What's wrong?

196
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,125
Are you crazy, pascha? Stay calm.

197
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,086
Behave! Behave! Behave!

198
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,133
Strange...

199
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:23,806
Are all of you in a bad mood tonight?

200
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,686
I don't get it.

201
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:56,255
It is an earthquake.

202
00:21:11,479 --> 00:21:12,646
Oh, Christ!

203
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:36,128
Now everything's blowing up!

204
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,925
What the fuck?

205
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,811
Damn it!

206
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,689
Hello!

207
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:40,734
Who else could it be
but my beloved inspector?

208
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,572
You're the only one who
calls when I'm taking a shower.

209
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,157
What's that?

210
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,535
What? Rats?

211
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,477
- Rats?
- Yes, you got that right.

212
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:56,792
- Rats! Rats! Rats! Thousands of rats!
- What have you got to do With rats?

213
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,838
They attacked two kids in their car.
They killed them, massacred them.

214
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,673
Fire rats? They killed them?

215
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:06,802
You have to see how they
mangled them. It's horrible.

216
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,744
What kind of rats are they.?
Normal ones, sewer rats.?

217
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,808
Rats, sewer rats, brown rats...
What the hell are they called?

218
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,613
They come out of the drains in thousands.

219
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:15,352
Where are you.?

220
00:23:15,436 --> 00:23:18,731
WernerstraBe. In that quarter
under construction, near Barnum.

221
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:22,943
I'm asking myself What
caused it. Maybe a gas leak.

222
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:29,366
Hey, hello! Hello Natl
Are you still there.?

223
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:34,079
Yeah, yeah, I'm still here.
You should see what I'm seeing.

224
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,166
- The exterminators showed up.
- I'll be right with you.

225
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,794
Well, doctor, don't you think
this might be your department?

226
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,194
Isn't it strange.? Aren't you interested?

227
00:23:43,236 --> 00:23:44,586
Of course I'm interested!

228
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,640
So stop talking to the phone,
move it, and get over here.

229
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,610
- Relax, IVat, I'm half-naked
- Rip, I need you. Hurry up.

230
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,012
I'll race down there.
But if they fine me.?

231
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:54,154
Quite the novelty...

232
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:58,228
I'll take care of it, as usual,
speed devil. Now move it.

233
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,776
Put up a barrier!

234
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,362
2nd squad over here!
Increase the pressure!

235
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,222
Hans! Wolfgang!

236
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:44,900
Oh, my God... Miller...

237
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,737
Wolfgang!

238
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:53,784
Watch out!

239
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,045
No! No!

240
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,297
No!

241
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,210
Go away! Go!

242
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,937
So, can nature go crazy?

243
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,817
Can animal madness and violence
create monstrous assassins?

244
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:12,404
Yet another question:
Can nature strike back?

245
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,906
The answer is: Yes.

246
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,951
Yes, the monsters
from our darkest fears...

247
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,538
and ancestral nightmares
are becoming a reality.

248
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:27,169
We arrived at a time when we have to
tolerate injustice, infamy, mutilations...

249
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:31,173
ecological and biological
horrors. We have no intention...

250
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:27,729
- Miss, there's a call waiting for you.
- For me? Thank you.

251
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,232
On our nature is pure madness.

252
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,651
We kill and destroy...

253
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,948
- Excuse me.
- No problem.

254
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:42,870
We kill and destroy our nature
because we don't know any better.

255
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,039
- Silence.
- Oh, excuse me.

256
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,625
- Do you know where the phones are?
- Yes, thank you.

257
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:52,629
We have to obey our genetic heritage
and to laws that are stronger than we are.

258
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:58,302
We have contaminated our atmosphere,
and the cancer we introduced...

259
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:04,308
There's a phone call for me, right?

260
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,435
Thank you.

261
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,940
Hello? Yes?

262
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:20,782
Susy is daughter of Laura.

263
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,953
They say Laura is mother of Susy.

264
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:29,708
Also, Susy worries from
afar about her mother Laura.

265
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,628
Have you eaten, Laura?
Have you washed, Laura?

266
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,463
That's not funny. Cut it out.

267
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,257
Blow your nose if you
have a cold. Behave.

268
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,095
If you have something to tell me, do so.
In any case, I'll pick you up at 7:00 pm.

269
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:46,058
The tape is running out.
Susy is fine, Laura is fine.

270
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,353
Susy will wait for
Laura. That's all for Susy.

271
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,605
Goodbye, doctor.

272
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,568
One of these days, I
will strangle this girl.

273
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,248
That's it. That's the way.

274
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:14,920
- Go to the second hydrant!
- Drive them to the sewers.

275
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:20,550
Direct the flamethrower to
the sewers! Scorch them away!

276
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,515
I have seen some crazy
animals lately, but never like these.

277
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:27,933
I can't explain it.

278
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:31,770
I'm pretty certain there's
a gas leak in the drains.

279
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:35,649
That doesn't explain their
aggressiveness, of course.

280
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:38,792
You wouldn't have
achieved much with water.

281
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,779
And with poison you would've
contaminated half the neighborhood.

282
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,574
Fire is the only way to kill them.

283
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:00,757
Leave some of them alive, please.

284
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,260
Nat, they're probably rabid...

285
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:08,265
but to make sure, I'll have to
analyze their saliva in the lab, okay?

286
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:26,700
Help!

287
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:29,953
It's like they're possessed!
They're going crazy!

288
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,290
Help me! Help! They bit me! Help!

289
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,182
- Turn around! Turn around!
- Help me up! Help me up!

290
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,005
- Yeah, like that!
- Do something!

291
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,840
They're still all over me!

292
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,181
- Where's the special unit?
- Here! Come here!

293
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,976
- It's Masterson, they got him!
- Crush them! Crush them!

294
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,439
They're afraid of nothing! Look
what they've done to the boot!

295
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,567
They jumped at me from the ground.

296
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,195
- Did they bite you too?
- No, I'm fine.

297
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:07,324
Take that boy to the
hospital for a rabies shot.

298
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,216
- When do you think you'll know something?
- No idea.

299
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:15,374
Send the other samples to the pasteur,
they're better equipped for these tests.

300
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,418
- I'll catch up with you as soon as I can.
- Okay.

301
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,129
Bye.

302
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:49,462
Brek.

303
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,674
Brek! What's the matter with you?

304
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,801
Behave, Brek, behave!

305
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,184
Brek!

306
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,491
Fritz! Hans!

307
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,666
What happened?

308
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,568
Damn it.

309
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,874
Wolfgang!

310
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:16,836
Impossible...

311
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:33,645
police?

312
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,190
Yes, my name is Berner, Rip Berner.

313
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:40,944
I'm the veterinarian of the
Strand Zoo in Michelstraße.

314
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,906
No, I'm not sure what
happened. Something terrible.

315
00:38:45,198 --> 00:38:47,784
There's a dead body, one of the guards.

316
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:49,326
The animals have escaped.

317
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,787
- Yes, they're very dangerous.
- Attention, attention...

318
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,957
all mobile units. Dangerous animals...

319
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:58,419
Attention, all units. Attention,
all units. Top priority! Code 16...

320
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:03,299
Block the streets according
to code 16. I repeat: code 16.

321
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,011
Unit 30, 31, 32 and 34 of district 20...

322
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,765
authorizing cordon of
sector D, quadrants 1 and 2.

323
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:13,685
Unit 30 and subsequents, join unit 18.

324
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:54,851
Let's see what the
hell got into these rats.

325
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:08,239
There's no doubt, they don't have rabies.
The pH of the blood indicates acidity.

326
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,116
Just a moment, Nat.

327
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,119
Matthaus, mobilize everyone.
I need some more analyses.

328
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:16,361
Repeat the blood and saliva
tests, and prepare me a Coleman.

329
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,708
Send all the samples to the Pasteur.

330
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,085
I want their opinion.

331
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,754
Nat, would you call the
bikers for the transport?

332
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,881
- They're here in two minutes.
- Listen, Rip...

333
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,384
Berger is sick, and Struhler
has some personal problems.

334
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:32,680
I don't give a damn!
Sickness, personal problems...

335
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:37,810
I want them all here - even if we
have to send the police to pick them up.

336
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,802
Where the hell are the cartridges?

337
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,733
If the Coleman result is
negative, try a Wurmser.

338
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:47,278
Now where are those damned cartridges?

339
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,908
- Hello?
- Rip, finally!

340
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,535
- Laura!
- Can you tell me what's going on?

341
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:57,455
Did you hear about the
escape of the zoo animals?

342
00:40:57,747 --> 00:40:59,374
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

343
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:03,216
But the radio didn't say that the
guards are dead - they massacred them.

344
00:41:03,378 --> 00:41:06,043
Sorry, I have to hang
up. Catch you later.?

345
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:06,506
Sure.

346
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:09,457
I forgot that you don't have your car.

347
00:41:09,499 --> 00:41:12,470
No, it's okay, the
subway is pretty close.

348
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,472
See you later, Laura.

349
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,637
Excuse me, would you listen for a minute?

350
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,769
Hello? Hello?

351
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,689
Have you seen all that
chaos? It's incredible.

352
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:27,610
It seems that they've spotted lions at
Brumerallee and panthers at Kurtenplatz.

353
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:32,323
How could that happen? Hello?

354
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,868
Hello? Hello Klaus, run to the newspaper.

355
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,080
Of course, at once. When else?

356
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,972
Hello? The police closed
down the Struttwage quarter.

357
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,419
- Hold the line.
- One moment. Hello?

358
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,462
- Would you take the third?
- Sure, with my feet...

359
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,257
Block the first page. We'll
exchange column 5 and 6.

360
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:13,197
There's now a curfew for
the quarters west of the Rhein.

361
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,743
Fire state of emergency
has stopped all life in the city.

362
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:20,621
Fire authorities do not try to hide the
exceptional gravity of what has happened

363
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:23,089
It has been established
that no less than 30

364
00:42:23,131 --> 00:42:25,501
beasts, 4 Indian and
3 African elephants...

365
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,296
have escaped the Strand
Zoo in Michelstraße.

366
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:32,258
A cordon of police and military forces...

367
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:40,892
No! Help! My God, it's horrible!

368
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,269
Start the car! Start the car! Quick!

369
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,938
- Quick!
- It won't start! It won't start!

370
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,649
That fuckin' thing is dead!

371
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:54,947
No! No! Help! Help!

372
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,241
Stay calm!

373
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,702
Close the windows!
Close them! Close them!

374
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:03,081
It doesn't work! It doesn't work!

375
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,957
Help... Help...

376
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,671
No!

377
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,681
Get lost! No!

378
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:39,534
Alfred! Alfred!

379
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:45,039
Help me! Alfred!

380
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,467
Unit 8, unit 8 for
King. 8 for King. Over.

381
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,763
- I hear you, K.
- It seems there's a tiger at Gartenplatz.

382
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:46,058
K for King, K for King. Code 20. Code 20.

383
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:50,062
- Unit 8 for King. Unit 8 for King.
- Receiving, 8. Authorization to proceed.

384
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:53,774
- Central calling F. Freddy.
- Freddy to Central, copy.

385
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:57,528
Listen, Freddy, you need to
go to zone Kurt Schumacher.

386
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,653
An emergency.

387
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,406
There's an animal there, a
predator, possibly a leopard

388
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,452
We don't know for sure, but
the call was legit. I repeat.'

389
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,872
Zone Kurt Schumacher. That's
between Bower- and Lipstraße.

390
00:45:08,164 --> 00:45:11,292
Alright, Central, copy that.

391
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:15,115
Are you sure your soporific really works?

392
00:45:15,157 --> 00:45:16,756
Sure it works. Relax.

393
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:20,635
It knocks out a rhino in seconds.
You worry about your driving, huh?

394
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,174
"That was 'Silver Moon" by Mutilati'.

395
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,678
Hey, do you know why someone
With just one leg has a short life.?

396
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,348
Because he already has one
foot in the grave! Macabre, huh.?

397
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,673
777/5 is Sun Radio 5!

398
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,093
- Oh, no!
- Fire station that's all about politics.

399
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:31,640
Now here's a brand-new piece of music
for you: "Clap, Clap, Clap" by Simba!

400
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,617
- Is she crazy?
- Look, she's not crazy!

401
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,166
She's chased by Cheetah! I recognize her!

402
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,205
Oh, Christ!

403
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,124
Hurry!

404
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:24,128
- Hurry! Turn around!
- That's what I'm doing!

405
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:34,638
- I'll run over that beast!
- No good, you won't make it!

406
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,641
I'll try to get as close as possible.

407
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:41,228
Can't you take her out with
that syringe gun of yours?

408
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,023
No, no, impossible under
these circumstances.

409
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:47,902
Use my gun. It's in
the glove compartment.

410
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,070
- There it is!
- Yes, yes, I got it!

411
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:51,447
Hurry up!

412
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:58,329
The car's not steady enough!
I'm afraid I might shoot the girl!

413
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,002
No!

414
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,509
Damn, is she crazy?

415
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:14,595
Hurry up, we must stop her!

416
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,360
Come on, Nat, we must stop her!

417
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:32,238
Watch out, it's red!
Stop! You won't make it!

418
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:49,797
Nat, you take care of the animal!

419
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,011
There's nothing we can do for him.

420
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,932
Nat, Nat, bring the extinguisher!

421
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:02,101
Oh, my God.

422
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,815
Nat!

423
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,998
I missed the beast!

424
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,500
Forget it, that poor guy's dead.

425
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,633
- How is she?
- She can still make it! Stay with her!

426
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:37,386
No, Rip, are you crazy?
The tank could explode!

427
00:51:37,678 --> 00:51:40,889
- I can't make it!
- Come on, give me a hand.

428
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:44,476
Move it. Quick, take her away from here.

429
00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,940
- I'll call an ambulance.
- Get down!

430
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:11,253
Yes, another car was
destroyed at Normenplatz.

431
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,799
777ere are four dead and one badly
wounded No, no trace of the elephants.

432
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,762
A witness claims to have seen
them heading down Williamstraße.

433
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:22,015
Another witness, a woman, has seen them

434
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:24,266
entering a parking lot
at Katharinenstraße.

435
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:27,061
- Maybe...
- This is inspector Weber.

436
00:52:27,353 --> 00:52:29,646
What do you mean, there's
no trace of the elephants?

437
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,899
You know what elephants are?

438
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,070
They're elephants, not lice! Elephants!

439
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:38,697
Now go find them, Jesus! Move it!

440
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:58,569
- Now what are you doing, Susy?
- "The Dying Swan".

441
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,447
Looks more like a dying lame duck.

442
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,907
Alright, let's go to work, kids.

443
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:07,077
Tommy! Hanna! Helga! Come on.

444
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,246
All together now.

445
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:15,335
One, and two, and three, and four.

446
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:18,547
One, and two...

447
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,421
Savanna Alpha Savanna. Landing
coordinates: 12 and 14 Beta.

448
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,712
Quadrants 3-2-1.

449
00:55:00,754 --> 00:55:03,300
Pamela Alpha Marina.
Loop altitude: 2,000.

450
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:05,437
Alignment radio beacon Omega.

451
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:08,096
Savanna Alpha Savanna. Everything's okay.

452
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,516
Alignment completed.

453
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:17,481
- Burma Elisa Alpha. Wait for coordinates.
- Tango Alpha Charlie 6-3-2, okay.

454
00:55:17,773 --> 00:55:19,900
- Runway 8 is clear.
- Copy.

455
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:22,444
Heading for coordinate 16-1.

456
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,988
Slowing down.

457
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:30,494
I repeat: Heading for coordinate 16-1.

458
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:33,622
Tango Alpha Charlie
6-3-2. Okay, runway 8.

459
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,417
I'll bring Oscar, and
you will bring Jill.

460
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,309
It would be perfect to do
something together tonight.

461
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,672
My boyfriend calls me in
my room every day at 9 pm.

462
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,260
No problem. I'll see you
in your room then, huh?

463
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,346
Forget it!

464
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:57,604
Easy, easy, nobody
will steal it from you.

465
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:01,191
Look at you... Look what you did.

466
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:05,195
How do you get yourself so dirty
all the time? I'm at my wits' end.

467
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,782
- You're always a problem.
- She's only little.

468
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:37,060
- Am I going crazy?
- Elephants!

469
00:56:52,868 --> 00:56:55,412
- There's something on the runway.
- What?

470
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,248
I can't tell what it is.

471
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:05,255
Emergency! Emergency!
There are ele... mobile obstacles!

472
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,597
Mobile obstacles on
the runway! Watch out!

473
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:09,468
Elephants...?

474
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,763
- Elephants!
- Flap twenty!

475
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:17,601
Maximum thrust! We need
to bring her up, for God's sake!

476
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:26,067
We're stalling! We won't
make it! I'll try to land!

477
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,987
Go faster! It's too
short! Maximum reverse!

478
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:32,574
Come on, baby, you gotta make it! Quick!

479
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,493
Come on!

480
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,432
- What happened?
- No idea!

481
00:58:02,771 --> 00:58:04,856
Always the same old story...

482
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,109
Not again...

483
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:09,903
Nothing works in this city.

484
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,245
- Dear God, I hope it's not a blackout.
- What are you saying?

485
00:58:13,407 --> 00:58:15,007
It's nothing. Don't worry, honey.

486
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,662
If you really want to know, the
problem is that nobody gives a damn!

487
00:58:18,954 --> 00:58:21,873
Everybody wants everything!
Air conditioning, heating...

488
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:24,501
washing machines, electric cookers...

489
00:58:24,793 --> 00:58:27,043
Of course everything
blows! It's a total mess!

490
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,756
Nobody understands anything anymore!

491
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:33,051
- May I ask for your name?
- Hers? Carol.

492
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,143
But I prefer calling her "The Pest".

493
00:58:36,263 --> 00:58:37,514
What was that?

494
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,225
Did you hear that too?

495
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,937
God, I don't understand...
What's going on?

496
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,362
I'm the monster from the
black hole of the galaxy!

497
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,699
I came to eat you all!

498
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,953
Silence! Be a little quiet!

499
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:04,374
Susy, there should be some flashlights
in the closet next to the door.

500
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,960
Tommy, would you help her?

501
00:59:22,142 --> 00:59:25,145
- The lights are off.
- Well, we're quite aware of that.

502
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:30,275
I have to check the fuses. There's
no water or telephone either.

503
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:34,237
- Nothing works in this damn shack.
- May I go get a drink?

504
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:35,989
Yes, go.

505
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:40,869
- The last one won't get a drink!
- I'm thirsty too!

506
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:47,584
- Want some water?
- No, thanks, I'll have a coke.

507
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:53,548
Come on, throw the ball. Come on!

508
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,954
- Did you hear that?
- Mommy!

509
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:27,541
- Be quiet!
- What is it? What is it?

510
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:58,780
What is that? There! Look!

511
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:03,743
Somebody raise the alarm!
Come on, quick! Do something!

512
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,005
Stand back, stand back!

513
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,594
Mommy! Mommy!

514
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:38,862
No! Help! Help me! No! Help!

515
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:56,755
Break open the doors!
Break open the doors!

516
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,759
Oh, my God!

517
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:09,309
Watch out for the girl, you'll crush
her! Watch out for the little girl!

518
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:20,362
- The doors! The doors!
- Mommy! Mommy!

519
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:23,615
Carol! Carol!

520
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:51,101
- Go, go!
- Move it, quick!

521
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:58,900
Pick her up! Somebody pick her up, quick!

522
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,194
- Out of the way!
- Hurry!

523
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,282
Oh, my God!

524
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,159
Mommy!

525
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:15,375
Mommy!

526
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,306
- Mommy!
- Come on, quick! Come here.

527
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,197
- Don't look.
- Where's my mommy?

528
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,727
I'll take you to your mommy.

529
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:38,565
- Be still, please!
- Where's my mommy?

530
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:42,235
We'll find her, you'll see. It's okay...

531
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:45,155
Stay calm... Stay calm!

532
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:49,701
- Mommy!
- We'll find her. We'll find your mommy!

533
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:54,205
I don't get it. Really,
I just don't get it.

534
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,292
Well, I'm asking myself how
this could possibly happen.

535
01:03:57,584 --> 01:04:00,754
At least the blackout
only affects two quarters.

536
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,923
I'm not thinking about the
blackout, but about the animals, Nat.

537
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:07,135
They are so ferocious,
so incredibly aggressive.

538
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:10,430
It was Cheetah, an animal
that never attacks anybody.

539
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:14,572
I know her very well, she's shy. She's
startled by a leaf falling from a tree.

540
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,991
I don't understand the animals' behavior.

541
01:04:17,033 --> 01:04:19,439
They all seem to be
hit by the same virus.

542
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:22,901
- How can you eat all this stuff?
- What stuff?

543
01:04:23,193 --> 01:04:25,195
Ah, it's a habit.

544
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:28,406
Attention all units! Code R! Code R!

545
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,826
An unknown number of
animals attacked a tube wagon.

546
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,818
F. Freddy, F. Freddy, do you
read me.? Do you read me.?

547
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:38,583
- Here's Freddy, I'm listening.
- A message for Dr. Berner.

548
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,795
Go immediately to the
station and join a special squad

549
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,137
It seems the reported animals are tigers.

550
01:04:44,297 --> 01:04:47,425
F. for Freddy. You're
the closest to the spot.

551
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:50,512
Go to the Kurt Schumacher
station immediately. Over.

552
01:04:50,804 --> 01:04:52,430
Copy.

553
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:58,436
Inspector, here's Berner. Is there any
news from the Pasteur or my lab? Over.

554
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,106
Nothing yet, doctor, but I'm in
constant contact with both laboratories.

555
01:05:02,190 --> 01:05:04,818
As soon as I know
something, I'll let you know.

556
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,665
Calm down, honey, calm down.

557
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,035
I can't go on...

558
01:05:58,413 --> 01:06:00,290
Oh, my God...!

559
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:10,800
Susy! Susy!

560
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,807
This is great, Tommy!

561
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,809
Can you do a lion, Tommy?

562
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:30,904
Come on, Tommy!

563
01:06:31,196 --> 01:06:33,239
Tommy, stop it, I'm scared.

564
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:50,089
Did you hit her?

565
01:06:52,509 --> 01:06:54,594
Give me the rifle.

566
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:02,143
Go get her now. She's
not dangerous any more.

567
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,731
Laura! What are you doing here?

568
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:10,026
Rip, it's like a miracle
to see you again.

569
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:12,612
- Relax, now everything...
- Carol! Carol!

570
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:14,822
- Mommy!
- Oh, Carol!

571
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:16,950
- Mommy!
- Stay calm, madam.

572
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,409
- Oh, my Carol!
- Mommy!

573
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,162
- It's okay now!
- Don't worry.

574
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:22,914
Mommy!

575
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,626
- I called her Susy.
- What?

576
01:07:27,961 --> 01:07:32,924
I ran, I ran towards that
light. But I could never reach it.

577
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:34,759
It was a nightmare.

578
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:37,845
- I will never forget it.
- But it had a happy ending.

579
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,223
You'll need medical attention, Laura.
The officers will take you to the station.

580
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:45,270
- I've arranged an emergency ward there.
- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

581
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,063
Refresh your makeup at least,
so you won't embarrass me.

582
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,197
Always in the mood
for a joke, aren't you?

583
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,445
- What should we do with the animal?
- Don't shoot her, I need her alive.

584
01:07:54,737 --> 01:07:58,032
I want to find out what happened.
She'll be asleep in a few seconds.

585
01:07:58,116 --> 01:08:00,034
As you wish, doctor.

586
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,790
The chain... and the stick.

587
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,503
Now surround her. Go slowly, slowly.

588
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,758
It's Gladis! It's Gladis.
Do you recognize me?

589
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,428
Gladis, hey...

590
01:08:19,554 --> 01:08:22,974
You're totally plastered,
huh? Gladis, look here.

591
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:27,520
It's okay now, huh?

592
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:30,356
Be good... be good.

593
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,900
- Be careful, doctor!
- No, there's no danger.

594
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:37,572
She can hardly stand on her feet.
Be good... It's alright, Gladis, alright.

595
01:08:37,864 --> 01:08:39,907
Behave...

596
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,954
Here we go! Let's go home now, huh?

597
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,665
Be ready with the net. Spread it wide.

598
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:53,796
Tighter! Tighter! It has
to be tighter! A little more!

599
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,591
Now!

600
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,218
That's it!

601
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:01,596
Come on, be nice.

602
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:06,809
- Do you enjoy the show, inspector?
- You really are completely crazy.

603
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:05,827
- Come on, quick!
- Hurry up! Come on!

604
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:53,040
I tried to call the school at
least a hundred times now...

605
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:55,710
but the line's always busy.

606
01:10:56,711 --> 01:11:00,673
The class should be over in half
an hour. I really have to pick her up.

607
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:04,177
- Nat, can't you go faster?
- The lines are overloaded.

608
01:11:04,469 --> 01:11:06,762
Everyone's on the phone
trying to find out what's going on.

609
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:08,806
It's always like that.

610
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:20,985
Help! Help! Help me!
Don't leave me here alone!

611
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,196
- Help!
- I'm coming.

612
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:24,025
Natalia!

613
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:26,616
Stop shouting, or it
will hear us. Got it?

614
01:11:26,908 --> 01:11:28,493
Come on.

615
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:32,246
Come here. Come here. I'll carry you.

616
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:35,041
Go, go, hurry! Come on!

617
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,584
- Susy!
- What's up?

618
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:39,170
Listen, I'm going to
the kitchen. Wait here.

619
01:11:39,462 --> 01:11:41,255
But why?

620
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,778
Take it, for self-defense. Come on, run!

621
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,912
- Tommy!
- Don't stop! Run! Run!

622
01:12:27,051 --> 01:12:30,596
- Go, go! Tommy and Susy, where are they?
- We don't know!

623
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,098
- Wait!
- Here they are!

624
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,724
- Where were you?
- In the kitchen.

625
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,608
I got some knives, for self-defense.

626
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,980
Here, if you see him,
you throw it at him.

627
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:41,399
Help!

628
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:49,031
- I'm scared! I'm scared!
- Don't scream! Don't scream! Listen!

629
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,908
In there.

630
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:55,079
- Help! There he is!
- The key. Which one is it?

631
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:56,956
I can't find it.

632
01:12:57,957 --> 01:12:59,625
I'll get it.

633
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,212
Don't you move. Don't move!

634
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:09,719
Come on, quick. Hurry.
Get in. Get in! Hurry!

635
01:15:00,371 --> 01:15:02,540
Just what I thought.

636
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,125
They're reacting to the
injection, unfortunately.

637
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:08,629
What kind of reaction? What do you mean?

638
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:11,173
I'm not 100% sure, but if what I think is

639
01:15:11,215 --> 01:15:13,676
true, it's incredible,
basically impossible.

640
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,804
There's phenol in the
blood. Phenol chlorate.

641
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,433
Matthaus, check if it's cyclical.

642
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:22,601
Laura, are you coming?

643
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,856
The entrance is full of journalists.
I can't hold them back anymore.

644
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:28,982
They want to come in.

645
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,193
- Talk to you, take photos.
- No way.

646
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:34,696
- Anyway, here's the chlorate.
- Don't worry, I'll take care of them.

647
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,783
- It's 3%.
- Perfect. Let's proceed with the alkalis.

648
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,417
Rip, whatever it is,
to make them drink it,

649
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:42,788
someone must have
put it in their troughs.

650
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:46,416
- But who would? Only a crazy person...
- I don't think it's the work of a madman.

651
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:48,544
The solution has to be the water.

652
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:51,046
It's the only element all
animals have in common.

653
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:54,467
How could've anyone put
the same amount of phenol...

654
01:15:54,759 --> 01:15:57,219
into all their troughs?
Can you tell me that?

655
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,055
Listen, do you know someone
in the city's water department?

656
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:01,599
I don't think so...

657
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,642
Wait a moment! Berthros!

658
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:06,771
I could ask him. He works for the city.

659
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,106
I guess I know what you're thinking.

660
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,441
- Doctor.
- Excuse me, doctor, do you have a minute?

661
01:16:11,525 --> 01:16:14,862
- What is it now?
- Come with us. You have to see it.

662
01:16:15,154 --> 01:16:16,864
Excuse me.

663
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:26,290
Dr. Berthros? Hi, I'm Laura Schwarz.

664
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,043
I'm calling you from the zoo.

665
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:32,713
Yes, doctor. And I think
soon you'll be involved, too.

666
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:06,914
- Where the hell are they going?
- Oh, God, I think they're crazy!

667
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:10,508
Where do they come from?

668
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:12,850
Oh, God, I hope they
won't climb the stairs!

669
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,798
- Look how they run!
- But where are they heading?

670
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,092
Hey, it's hundreds of them!

671
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:38,487
Go, go! Let's get away from here! Hurry!

672
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,240
Hurry! Hurry! No...

673
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,619
Let's go over there! Run!

674
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,746
Look, there they are!

675
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:09,685
They're smashing the glass!

676
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:29,914
Go, go, go!

677
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,291
Go! Go!

678
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:37,880
They calmed down all of a sudden.

679
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,965
They were screaming
and growling like crazy.

680
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,424
- Now they're quiet.
- Ah, yes?

681
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,968
You see?

682
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,597
- Don't give them anything to drink.
- Sure, they notified us.

683
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:50,851
- Look at Toto. He was furious, but now...
- Hey Toto, want some apple?

684
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:53,729
Come on, take it. Open your mouth.

685
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:57,441
- Now he's an angel.
- Yeah, true. He's back to normal.

686
01:18:57,733 --> 01:19:01,362
Look here. Come on.
Now, Toto, take it. Come on.

687
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:05,324
- Does he eat a lot?
- Now he's eating quite a lot.

688
01:19:05,616 --> 01:19:07,952
Good. Very good. Here you are.

689
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,205
You got over it, huh? Come on, take it.

690
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:14,166
Give him lots of fresh vegetables, yes?

691
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,259
Could you please repeat that?

692
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,719
Hey, it's Berthros.

693
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,806
Nothing unusual in the main tanks.

694
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:32,268
- And in the aqueduct?
- Ah, I see. And in the aqueduct?

695
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:33,644
Nothing.

696
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,658
Doctor, it's phencyclidine alright. Look.

697
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:36,438
Okay, thank you.

698
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,322
You can reach me at home.
You got the number, right? Yes.

699
01:19:39,483 --> 01:19:42,945
- See you soon.
- My God, it's incredible, crazy...

700
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:50,244
The guys from the water department,
the police, the firemen are all...

701
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:52,663
- What's that?
- PCP.

702
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,331
- Incredible.
- It's dynamite.

703
01:19:54,415 --> 01:19:58,252
Junkies call that stuff "Angel
Dust", "Peace Pills", "Zombie Dust".

704
01:19:58,544 --> 01:20:00,421
Also "Jet Fuel" and "Busy Bee".

705
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,465
A thousandth of a gram
to go totally bonkers.

706
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,593
- But that's absurd!
- I thought they only smoke it.

707
01:20:06,885 --> 01:20:08,053
You can smoke it...

708
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:13,809
sniff it, shoot it, eat it, drink it.

709
01:20:14,101 --> 01:20:16,103
- The worst of all drugs.
- Are you sure?

710
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,022
I'll take it.

711
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:23,402
Hello? Yes, it's me. It's Gustav
Sorensen, the health minister.

712
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,363
Yes, of course I can
confirm Dr. Schwarz' report.

713
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:31,285
Now I can even be more precise:
It's phencyclidine hydrochloride.

714
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:34,830
- Phencyclidine hydrochloride?
- Yes, yes, phencyclidine.

715
01:20:35,122 --> 01:20:38,272
What you just told me is truly
incredible. You're quite certain?

716
01:20:38,542 --> 01:20:41,753
I imagine that you know that
phencyclidine hydrochloride is a drug.

717
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,922
Exactly, PCP.

718
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,814
I have the reports from the central
in Ipswage, and they're all negative.

719
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:51,576
- Your discovery seems impossible to me.
- What do you mean, "impossible"?

720
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:54,766
- Can you send me some samples?
- Sure! Where do you want them?

721
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:59,146
Good. Do you want me to send
someone to pick up those famous samples?

722
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:01,231
No, that won't be necessary.

723
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,873
I have a police officer
here with me in the lab.

724
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,486
Goodbye, sir.

725
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,197
He wants the samples we analyzed.

726
01:21:08,489 --> 01:21:11,700
Matthaus, get them ready. I'll take
them there. You're coming, Nat?

727
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:13,827
Doctor, do with me whatever you want.

728
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:16,052
Susy's school is on
the way to the pasteur.

729
01:21:16,094 --> 01:21:17,747
We'll pick her up and then carry on.

730
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:21,085
Ah, so that's why you went out earlier.

731
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:23,003
At least it's not PCP.

732
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:30,803
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?

733
01:21:31,095 --> 01:21:34,264
That the best lawyers and
insurers will have a lot to do...

734
01:21:34,556 --> 01:21:37,643
in order to unravel
this tragic confusion.

735
01:21:37,935 --> 01:21:41,980
I think that millions and millions won't
be enough to recover the damages.

736
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,510
Have you told
headquarters that the drug's

737
01:21:44,552 --> 01:21:46,777
effects should have worn off by now, Nat?

738
01:21:47,069 --> 01:21:48,612
Sure.

739
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:54,952
The lights! It's a
miracle, they're back on!

740
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:58,789
My God, this nightmare is finally over.

741
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,733
I'll go in and get
Susy. I'll be right back.

742
01:22:27,025 --> 01:22:30,195
Wait here, Nat, I'll go with her.

743
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:35,159
- Hey, look!
- What is it?

744
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,870
What are you doing here, pompeo? Pompeo!

745
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:42,499
- Pompeo? Who the hell is pompeo?
- It's him over there. Look!

746
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,919
Pompeo, old beast,
what are you doing here?

747
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:48,922
- Don't get too close.
- Oh no, he's a good boy.

748
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,299
- Pompeo has always been my buddy.
- Maybe...

749
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,469
- Right, pompeo?
- Step aside.

750
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,973
It's all good, don't worry.
Pompeo, how did you get here?

751
01:22:58,265 --> 01:22:59,475
Watch out!

752
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:02,436
What are you doing, huh? Pompeo!

753
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:06,732
Hey! Why don't you
behave? Huh, Pompeo? Huh?

754
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:11,445
- What's up, fatty? Come on.
- Now take a look at this loony...

755
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:15,574
Well now, are you my friend
or not? Come on, let's go?

756
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,661
I'll call the special unit, Rip.

757
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:23,499
Don't let the kids out until
Pompeo is back in his cage...

758
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,890
- and with his trainer.
- Alright, alright!

759
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,754
Hey Nat, come here.
Pompeo wants to meet you.

760
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,298
Tell him I'm busy.

761
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,269
Mrs. Vogner?

762
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,382
Susy?

763
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:26,520
Susy?

764
01:24:33,485 --> 01:24:36,989
Blue is the sky, green is the grass.

765
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:41,910
Close... close... close
your eyes so you...

766
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:45,747
so you... so you...

767
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:49,209
Close your eyes so you won't see.

768
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:02,389
Close your mouth so you won't talk.

769
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:07,644
Close your mouth so you won't
scream. So you won't scream.

770
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,146
Won't scream.

771
01:26:15,962 --> 01:26:17,547
Susy...

772
01:26:37,693 --> 01:26:40,779
Mommy! Mommy, they're
crazy! They're all crazy!

773
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,740
Take me away from here,
mommy! They will kill us!

774
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,910
They have knives,
mommy! They have knives!

775
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,704
And then, the lights,
mommy... The lights were gone!

776
01:26:49,788 --> 01:26:52,207
It was Tommy! They didn't do anything!

777
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:56,336
Tommy came closer,
mommy! And then... then...

778
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:47,012
- She screamed and they laughed, mommy!
- Lady...

779
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,431
Beautiful lady, come and play with us.

780
01:27:49,723 --> 01:27:51,973
It's wonderful. Please,
why aren't you coming?

781
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:55,771
They are evil, mommy,
take me away from here!

782
01:27:56,605 --> 01:27:58,231
Alright...

783
01:27:59,065 --> 01:28:01,943
Alright, I'll play with you. But...

784
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:05,197
But tell me what game
you want to play, Tommy.

785
01:28:05,489 --> 01:28:08,492
A beautiful one. A game you will like.

786
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,952
She liked it too, see?

787
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,498
Play... Play with us, beautiful lady.

788
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:24,633
Susy!

789
01:28:24,925 --> 01:28:26,384
No! No!

790
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,516
- Here they come!
- Calm down, honey!

791
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,228
They can't get out! I locked it!

792
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,437
Calm down!

793
01:28:37,729 --> 01:28:39,815
Calm down, you hear me? Calm down!

794
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:43,902
You're save with me! You're save!

795
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:49,366
Laura!

796
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:04,923
Calm down, Susy, I'm
begging you! Calm down!

797
01:29:07,217 --> 01:29:09,010
My God...!

798
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:12,430
Oh, God, please help us.

799
01:29:13,473 --> 01:29:14,891
Help us!
