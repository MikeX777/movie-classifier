1
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:14,594
The image you see, I shot it myself.

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,676
It's sitges,

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,511
and I'm there

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,142
during the shooting of a screwball film

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,805
that will lead us all to a miserable end.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,441
It's our last Sunday in sitges.

7
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,103
Today it's palm Sunday. Next Sunday is
easter,

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,987
and we'll go back to Rome.

9
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,656
I play lucio fulci

10
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,537
in the first film about his life.

11
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:45,625
As an actor, 've never
wanted to play a real character.

12
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:50,790
They told me, "no worries, fulci's life
was a legend anyway, a myth,

13
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:52,378
half a lie.

14
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,339
So you can do whatever you like.

15
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:56,720
You can be the fulci that suits you best."

16
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,482
The film director is Danish,
his pseudonym is Saigon.

17
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,978
He wants to make a film about
the most important moments

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,446
of fulci's life and work.

19
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,197
The centro sperimentale,

20
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,656
the films with Toto, sordi, Orson welles,

21
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,954
and the more violent
films. The fame, the obscurity,

22
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,703
and his premature death.

23
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,164
The first scene will be about an aged
fulci, alienated from the film industry,

24
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:35,963
while he's shooting his testimonial film,

25
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,670
a cat in the brain.

26
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,679
You need to start from the end

27
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,465
to work your way back to the start.

28
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,553
I am here in the makeup room

29
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,597
where they are turning me into fulci.

30
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,357
I'm thinking I should have
made a film about John belushi.

31
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,439
He was a self-indulgent genius,

32
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:54,945
someone like me.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,982
But once again I've been told not to worry,

34
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,071
because fulci was a genius

35
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,370
and he had many passions.

36
00:02:02,414 --> 00:02:05,326
I guess "passions" is a euphemism

37
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,706
for vices,

38
00:02:07,002 --> 00:02:08,242
addictions,

39
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,830
destruction.

40
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,958
The film director asked me to talk
to those who knew fulci.

41
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,298
He's sending me with a
production crew to do interviews.

42
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,338
I'll study and investigate,

43
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:22,927
like all the good actors,

44
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,932
because in the end

45
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,228
I will find out

46
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,636
who lucio fulci really was.

47
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,559
Saigon told me that if I
want to find the real fulci,

48
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,941
I need to speak to his younger daughter,

49
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:56,691
Camilla.

50
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,477
Everybody believed her to be dead,

51
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,190
to have vanished,

52
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,071
impossible to meet.

53
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:04,149
Really?

54
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,614
Sorry, I speak Roman dialect like dad.

55
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,619
Romanesco is the language of cinema.

56
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,706
Camilla overwhelms me with her tales.

57
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,785
Life has been hard on her,

58
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,669
but fuck me, she can make you laugh!

59
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,421
We'd started to shoot the house of clocks

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,130
and there was this handsome model,

61
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,510
Keith Van hoven.

62
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,306
In the early days, in the
evenings after shooting,

63
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,638
I dated this beautiful guy.

64
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,347
He put his hand on my shoulder

65
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:34,137
as we were leaving the hotel.

66
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,103
Then I heard, amid the
murmuring of the lobby,

67
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,482
a voice.

68
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:41,065
"Good catch, Camilla!"

69
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,364
That was my father,

70
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,901
in front of the whole crew.

71
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,067
Camilla, how much
do you miss your father?

72
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,031
My father is always with me,

73
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,571
even now.

74
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,247
For my father, I was like a mom,

75
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:55,864
as well as a girl and a daughter.

76
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:57,752
Sometimes he would remember that.

77
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,288
I miss him a lot,

78
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,071
even now while I'm talking about him.

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,503
I was born under the luckiest star.

80
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:10,345
I was tiny, 1.7 kilos,
but I came through okay.

81
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:14,933
I lived in a beautiful
house in via zandonai,

82
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,848
a prestigious, prosperous area in Rome.

83
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,517
I went to schools run by nuns.

84
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:21,981
Dad was a left-winger,

85
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,655
and his daughter went to
the nuns. Can you imagine!

86
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,449
Life was good though.

87
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,705
Mom worked at the cinema critics' union.

88
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,618
Dad said she was stunning,

89
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,127
but only from the hips up.

90
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,212
From the hips down,

91
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,908
she had legs like those of a table,

92
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,718
meaning no ankles.

93
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,807
Usually it takes some time before
kids understand their parents' jobs.

94
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,102
When did you figure out
what your father's job was?

95
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:58,230
With don't torture a duckling,
I more or less understood

96
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,358
that dad was a film director.

97
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:05,362
I remember the set and the lunch bags,

98
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,193
my first lunch bag.

99
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,244
Saigon says that the beyond
is the pinnacle of fulci's films.

100
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,451
It's unique and different
from all his other films.

101
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,793
This film begins in 1927,
the year of fulci's birth.

102
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,830
In the prologue, an innocent painter

103
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,920
gets killed, comes back to life,

104
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,801
and creates a fascinating,
yet infernal world.

105
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,681
Saigon told me to start there to get
familiar with fulci's pictures.

106
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,645
By 1981, fulci had
already directed 40 films,

107
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,977
but it's at that time that the
true lucio fulci emerged.

108
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,439
From zombie

109
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,071
to the New York ripper,

110
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,197
a handful of films

111
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,326
over three or four years.

112
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:55,704
In my opinion they are the center,

113
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,081
the heart of fulci"s cinema.

114
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,334
Somehow they are the beginning of his story

115
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,417
and the end too.

116
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,799
They embody everything that fulci

117
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,804
is today regarded for as a director.

118
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,091
Nothing shows the essence of fulci

119
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,680
like that handful of films.

120
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,313
Somehow lucio, at some point in his life,

121
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,520
decided that he

122
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:28,778
should start to tell his story.

123
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,406
Whether true or false, I don't care.

124
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,317
He started to tell a story

125
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:37,321
around which these movies revolved.

126
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,869
Davide pulici of "nocturno cinema"

127
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,626
will be my guide
through lucio fulci's films.

128
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,163
His voice is harsh, unconventional,

129
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,583
yet he knows where to find true beauty.

130
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,515
Camilla told me that in
each of her father's films

131
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,018
there's a piece of their family's life.

132
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,348
It's like a mosaic

133
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:04,731
that we, as an audience, will
never be able to reconstruct.

134
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,606
Can you tell of a bad
argument you had with your dad?

135
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,526
No, we didn't argue much.

136
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,693
But there was that one time

137
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,453
when dad, at 60 years old, bought a Vespa.

138
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Well,

139
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,578
I was a bit worried, of course.

140
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,583
He drove the Vespa

141
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,622
wearing a red baron's helmet

142
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,415
to go with his beard.

143
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,755
He goes out with this scooter

144
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:34,510
and comes back home almost at once.

145
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,806
I was dead worried

146
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,638
something must have happened.

147
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,596
But he was angry more
than anything else, very angry.

148
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,931
"You didn't tell me anything!"

149
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:43,720
“What?”

150
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,639
“Here you go again!”

151
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,942
“What?”

152
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,567
“Listen, I stopped at the traffic light.

153
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,149
As I was about to take off
again, a chap shouted at me:

154
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,656
'Boccio! Where do you
think you're going!"

155
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,483
What is 'boccio?"

156
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,988
Boccio in Roman dialect means

157
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,282
loopy old sod.

158
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,826
He felt like a loser.

159
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,331
Scholars assert that even in his films
with Franco and ciccio,

160
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,920
with celentano and Mina,

161
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,710
you can see fulci's trademark.

162
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,594
They say those films are
as good as the horror films,

163
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,100
although on an english fulci fan page

164
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,510
somebody wrote,

165
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:27,772
"you can remove 35 out of all his films
without missing anything at all."

166
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,517
Like an uncut diamond,
the rough must be removed.

167
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,106
Nobody in Germany, Japan, or France

168
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,317
buys a DVD of a fulci comedy.

169
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:41,073
Yet his horror films, even the worst,

170
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,987
are released in deluxe editions.

171
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,706
I don't think it's necessary

172
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,788
to watch all of fulci"s films

173
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,251
to understand his greatness.

174
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,712
I believe that a good
part of his filmography,

175
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:58,720
especially the early films

176
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,801
from the 50s,

177
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,841
or partially from the 60s,

178
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,385
I don't think these films

179
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,896
are essential to grasp fulci.

180
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,897
Enrico vanzina is one of the
masters of the Italian comedy.

181
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:17,481
I decided to meet him not only because
his father was fulci"s master,

182
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:21,364
but also because I'm interested in
what he remembers of lucio fulci.

183
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,155
Also his extraordinary ability to portray
iconic characters of Italian cinema,

184
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,286
and his memories as a child

185
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:30,076
as well as a fiimmaker.

186
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:34,506
In the 50s, making
movies was a serious affair,

187
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:36,757
indeed because it wasn't serious.

188
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,918
A bunch of jolly good fellows

189
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,964
with experience in comics

190
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,587
had shifted to the film industry.

191
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,722
I think dad was one of
the leaders of this group.

192
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,012
They invented a film genre,

193
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,769
in which a serious topic was
depicted in a light manner.

194
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,527
This is what the Italian-style comedy
is about, in a nutshell.

195
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,529
Fulci was in his element there

196
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,989
because he was an intellectual,

197
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,950
a very complicated person.

198
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,033
He was a funny communist.

199
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,124
Dad loved this intellectual side of fulci,

200
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,580
because dad was like him.

201
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,169
They were two guys partial to comedy

202
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,502
with a more serious background.

203
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,136
They were very deep,

204
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,252
very well educated.

205
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,888
So they found in their relationship

206
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:26,345
something absolutely special,

207
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:29,181
because fulci wasn't
just the assistant director.

208
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,017
He was also an author.

209
00:11:32,317 --> 00:11:37,357
Dad was immensely fond of lucio.

210
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,613
He passed this fondness
to me and my brother Carlo.

211
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,740
We used to see him often as kids,

212
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,027
because he used to
come to our home a lot.

213
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,038
We had a sort of crush on lucio fulci,

214
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,825
because he was like a comics character,

215
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,493
physically as well.

216
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:56,503
As kids we were mad about him.

217
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:01,668
Sergio salvati was the most important
cinematographer of fulci's films.

218
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,055
He's the man who shaped the images

219
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,886
and visions of fulci's world.

220
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,510
He's one of the greatest
men of Italian cinema.

221
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,065
One day I was at the
camera, waiting for the lights

222
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:17,692
and my chief operator,

223
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:23,482
when two people approached
bolognini, the director.

224
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,026
We were in a hall,
they were at the counter.

225
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,990
As I'm sitting at the camera

226
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,947
I heard them talking about cinema,

227
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,366
chatting away.

228
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,627
At some point, one of them asked bolognini,

229
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:38,538
“who's someone among the young directors

230
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,206
who can give us something good?”

231
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,924
I heard with my own ears mauro bolognini

232
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:50,593
say, “there's only one
who can write and make nice films.

233
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,386
His name is lucio fulci."

234
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,979
My mother liked lucio fulci,

235
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,769
but she was also a bit bothered by him

236
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:02,983
because lucio fulci smoked a lot.

237
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,136
When he used to come to our
place to work on screenplays

238
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,775
he made a mess with the ash.

239
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,361
So my mother used to lay newspapers

240
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,907
in my father's study under the
armchair where fulci would sit.

241
00:13:15,086 --> 00:13:17,577
He had to sit right there,
without complaining,

242
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,247
with all the newspapers around
the armchair to avoid any mess.

243
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:25,840
He was the idol of
a guy called otello.

244
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,800
Lucio fulci had an mg,

245
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,517
and when he was leaving
the screenplay meeting,

246
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,427
otello would run to the terrace

247
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,189
to see fulci getting into this mg cabrio

248
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,190
and roaring off just like James Bond.

249
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,946
Every time he saw him
pulling away, he used to say,

250
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,276
"what a force, Dr. fulci!"

251
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,202
If fulci had died in 1966,

252
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,497
so to speak,

253
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,075
with 15 films under his belt,

254
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,082
more than all the films kubrick
made in his whole life,

255
00:13:58,129 --> 00:14:00,085
nobody would have remembered him.

256
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,210
Perhaps because pain hadn't come yet.

257
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,300
Pain, with all it stirs,

258
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,587
with all the cinema it can create.

259
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,599
In her childhood memories, Camilla
often told me about sandro bitetto,

260
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,766
a very important person for her family,
especially for her father.

261
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:26,947
I worked with fulci from 1969 to 1974

262
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,196
as a personal assistant.

263
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,236
I used to do a bit of everything,

264
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,908
from paying bills to script boy,

265
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:40,539
until, bit by bit,

266
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:43,542
he introduced me to the film industry

267
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,254
as a production secretary of his films.

268
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:51,796
Judging by his manner
when I came into his life,

269
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,177
he gave me the impression of

270
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,016
being a messy guy

271
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,475
in need of someone who would tidy him up.

272
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:03,312
The first year I was
employed by him, in 1969,

273
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:08,276
there was the tragic
death of fulci's wife.

274
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,238
She sent the daughters to
the pictures with her brother,

275
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,578
And she remained alone.

276
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,249
She did it on purpose,

277
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,915
what she actually

278
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,927
managed to do.

279
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,255
How did she die?

280
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,013
She died with the gas.

281
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,514
I remember that day.

282
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:42,522
I came home first, with my uncle,
my mom"s brother, by car.

283
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,526
We'd been to the pictures with him.

284
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,607
She'd sent everybody away.

285
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:54,276
I remember ringing the
bell, but nobody answered.

286
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:58,408
All at once they put me in the car

287
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,292
and drove me to the entrance. They took me

288
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:07,331
into the watchman booth,
where I stayed for hours.

289
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,875
All I could hear were the sirens.

290
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,967
Then they took us to my
grandma Lucia, dad's mom,

291
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,633
both my sister and I.

292
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,686
They didn't tell us mum was dead.

293
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,598
They told us she had gone to Switzerland.

294
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,859
He never overcame this tragedy.
He was always

295
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,736
very, very...

296
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:40,906
He never came out of
this sense of

297
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:43,871
guilt or...

298
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:53,218
More than once he did
tell me about his pain,

299
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,757
how much he missed his wife.

300
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,901
After her death, he lived for his girls.

301
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,196
He always loved them very much.

302
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:28,123
Not now, but when I was young,
I was mom's spitting image.

303
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,789
As usual, he would
be quite ironic about it.

304
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:37,633
He used to say, "you look like your mother,
without the legs of a table."

305
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,729
Fulci's three thrillers, one on top
of the other/perversion story,

306
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,690
don't torture a duckling
and a lizard in a woman's skin

307
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,571
are good films,

308
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,282
well directed.

309
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:03,322
But I object to what has been said

310
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:09,540
by many, that those films are
the secret essence of fulci film-making.

311
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,251
About don't torture a duckling,

312
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,586
you can read everywhere these incredibly

313
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:18,260
disproportionate reviews

314
00:18:18,556 --> 00:18:22,640
on things fulci allegedly hinted at.

315
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:26,678
Sin, innocence, purity and the like,

316
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:31,099
stuff I don't give half a fuck about.

317
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:35,315
Because I think the power of
don't torture a duckling, for instance,

318
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,857
lays in a few scenes.

319
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,572
There's the scene of the maciara,

320
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,455
when the maciara gets killed with a chain,

321
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,160
which, not by coincidence,

322
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:51,453
will be replicated at the
start of the beyond.

323
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,122
I am much more interested
in referential quotes like this

324
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,589
than in all the boring discussions
about these movies,

325
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,674
objectively useless.

326
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:07,393
Dad loved dogs and
that was the "dog film."

327
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,475
He didn't like snow.
Six months in the snow,

328
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,232
he made the first white fang

329
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:16,894
with an enormous effort... two units,

330
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,985
plus a sled dogs' race.

331
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,575
He was asked to shoot
the sequel straight after.

332
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,235
The first one wasn't out yet.

333
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:28,782
Dad wasn't sure at all. "No, no, I
don't wanna make another dog film."

334
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,076
Because of the snow, etc.

335
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:33,916
Back then, he was married to a
German woman, his second wife.

336
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:39,585
He signed the contract, but
the first white fang wasn't out yet.

337
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:44,051
“I'll make it, it's not about
the money, I don't care.

338
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,762
This is the last time I'm
doing something like this."

339
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:50,053
White fang was released and
it was the great success that we know.

340
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,476
I went to visit him. The
German woman was there.

341
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,516
My sister was with me.

342
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,020
The German woman had pekingese dogs.

343
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:02,657
We often went up the perennial
glacier where dad was shooting.

344
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,614
There was this incredible
light on the glacier,

345
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:09,906
and dad said that the German was so selfish

346
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,949
that we were there without sunglasses,

347
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,933
while she put sunglasses on the pekingese.

348
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:20,216
I re-watched white fang recently.
It's a good film,

349
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:26,347
don't get me wrong. It's skillfully
directed by fulci.

350
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:32,979
But I don't think in a film like white fang

351
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:35,060
these explosions of

352
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,226
violence or cruelty,

353
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:44,357
the ability to overthrow genres,
I can't see all that in white fang.

354
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,572
I can see it much more in
the four of the apocalypse,

355
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:51,330
another film of that time.

356
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,287
This thing about the terrorist of genres,

357
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:58,830
that retroactively labels
every film by lucio,

358
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,215
makes me laugh.

359
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,548
If Sergio salvati is the
image of fulci's film-making,

360
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,339
fabio frizzi is the greatest composer of
fulci"s film soundtracks.

361
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,635
He's the son of fulvio frizzi, a big
distributor who also worked with fulci.

362
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:17,807
Fabio talks about his deep relationship
with fulci with a light touch.

363
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:23,612
Lucio was one of very few
who'd often talked about

364
00:21:23,908 --> 00:21:27,025
this nice relationship
he had with my father.

365
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:29,743
He described it, most of all,

366
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:35,454
as a matter of feeling valued
during difficult moments.

367
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:39,917
Lucio didn't have an easy private life,

368
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:46,633
therefore he felt the support and the
complicity of this prestigious distributor

369
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,470
who encouraged him to be productive again,

370
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,431
to come out with and
believe in something nice.

371
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,848
Can you tell me about your first music
for fulci in the four of the apocalypse?

372
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:03,770
It was a horror film disguised
as a western, in true fulci style.

373
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,359
The template music already existed,

374
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,776
support music for editing.

375
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:14,664
We were struck by the fact
that the producers decided to use

376
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:19,749
a Dylan song that would have started
any music composer off on the wrong foot,

377
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,378
“knockin' on heaven's door,"

378
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:25,542
at the end of the film. It was a rough cut.

379
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,710
I was worried about meeting this guy,

380
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,345
as he had the reputation
of being rather grumpy.

381
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,348
The idea was to go along
with the intention of the film,

382
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,102
not to have a traditional
wild west film soundtrack

383
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,480
with trombones and horns,

384
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,311
but to have a different musical tale,

385
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,319
with music closer to
the local environment.

386
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:57,198
I was lucky because I love
the west coast in general,

387
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:01,585
not just Dylan, but also Crosby,
stills & Nash and many other bands.

388
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:04,839
When the film was
released, and the soundtrack,

389
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:07,546
we were all very proud of what we had done.

390
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:12,589
And lucio had the opportunity to work
with people he didn't dislike at all.

391
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:15,849
Paolo malco acted only
in two of fulci's films,

392
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:20,935
but he was the only actor with whom
the director had a bond of true friendship.

393
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,641
Malco says they were a strange pair.

394
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:25,935
They went through thick and thin together.

395
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,064
It would have been a dream to be there

396
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,027
on one of their many adventures.

397
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:36,704
The first day of the
house by the cemetery

398
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,205
was not a good day.

399
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:43,328
We were shooting in a small
town near Boston, called Concord.

400
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,164
The scene was about me and my family

401
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,584
coming from New York by car.

402
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:54,551
As we were approaching, just before action,

403
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,715
I had the bad idea to take off my jacket.

404
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,010
“Action!” I'm getting there,

405
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,600
and I come out of the
car in my shirt.

406
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,935
“Stop!”

407
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,058
“What are you doing?”

408
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,852
An unbearable scream.

409
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:12,865
I was crushed and said,
“that's not a good start."

410
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,027
“Did I tell you to take off your jacket?

411
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,447
I didn't! So just do as you are told!”

412
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,536
Then I looked at him.

413
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:27,046
“If this is your start, we can call it a
day because I'll take the first flight out!

414
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,166
Nobody has ever treated me like this!

415
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,469
Is that clear?"

416
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,593
At that point lucio,

417
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,050
grumbling with his pipe in his mouth,

418
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,889
smiled at me.

419
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:46,603
On that day, an amazing
friendship was born!

420
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:49,898
As a film director,

421
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,860
he knew his stuff very well.

422
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,695
He wasn't messy.

423
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,611
He knew the script inside out.

424
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,450
He'd written it, of course, but

425
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,866
he knew it, and every
position of the camera.

426
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,769
He would immediately say, “camera here!"

427
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,584
He was a messy person in his private life,

428
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:14,256
but a perfectionist in his work.

429
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:19,928
Lucio had an unbridled, passionate
relationship with the camera.

430
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,809
He knew exactly where to position it.

431
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:30,151
When he said “let's put a zoom there,”
or “let's put on a 25” or “a 38,"

432
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,236
He knew exactly what he was talking about.

433
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,570
The psychic is interesting because of

434
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:46,038
some extraordinary self-quotations.

435
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,952
The first one is the most glaring of all.

436
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:53,670
It's the suicide of Virginia's
mother from the cliff,

437
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,381
which is identical to

438
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,889
the scene of Marc porel's death
in don't torture a duckling.

439
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:05,599
With a tacked-on mannequin,

440
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,138
clearly a fake,

441
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:13,311
fulci turned it into an
extraordinarily beautiful sequence,

442
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,525
even if, before our eyes,

443
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,237
right there is a mannequin.

444
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:25,406
Self-quoting, before fulci
became aware of being fulci,

445
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,746
is an extremely thorny
issue, in my opinion.

446
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:36,376
It's like the unconscious
desire to hit the audience

447
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,796
with his past life.

448
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,101
Today we are shooting
some promos for the film.

449
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,307
Saigon is explaining
what we are going to do.

450
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,938
We start with an aged fulci

451
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:52,065
acting in a cat in the brain.

452
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:55,945
We start with a mock, then we become
something else, like fulci used to do.

453
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,573
We switch to fulci and his actresses,

454
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,361
the man on one side,
the images he created on the other.

455
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:07,490
His views on the actresses,
his views on his art,

456
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,831
on the beautiful women he longs for,
and on his filmmaking.

457
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:22,763
A woman gets killed
with a hatchet.

458
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:30,228
Her face is split in two.

459
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,436
Another one is strangled.

460
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,115
Another one

461
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:44,405
is hanged.

462
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,953
Another one is cut into pieces
with a chainsaw.

463
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,635
Another one is drowned in boiling water,

464
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,552
her throat torn to
pieces by an enraged cat.

465
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,688
Burned to death,

466
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,066
buried alive,

467
00:28:20,991 --> 00:28:22,652
tortured,

468
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,694
stabbed,

469
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,620
sawn in two,

470
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,331
crucified,

471
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,997
beheaded.

472
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:50,093
In my early films, women were totally wild,

473
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:57,649
Full of life,

474
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,436
beautiful and innocent,

475
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,072
like life in the 60s,

476
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,402
like my life at the time.

477
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,831
In my thrillers, they became shady.

478
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:33,515
Victims, as well as executioners,

479
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,399
mirrors of my dreams,

480
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,936
and of my fears.

481
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,952
In the New York ripper,

482
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,786
I told of the beauty and the
dangers of being a woman.

483
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,578
It's my most cruel and

484
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,998
painful film.

485
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:07,882
I love women.

486
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:19,891
It is for them I make pictures.

487
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:29,200
In fulci's movies, sexuality always
appears in a quite deviant way.

488
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,863
Lesbianism is at the base of
a lizard in a woman's skin.

489
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:39,706
I can't think of anything more exciting
than the scene where florinda bolkan

490
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:43,247
gets closer to Anita strindberg
on that red bed.

491
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:50,513
Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think fulci
has ever revealed in his films

492
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:54,299
this sexual frame of mind.

493
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:58,892
He was consumed with desire
because he loved women on the set,

494
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:04,276
when they were acting, playing
any good or bad part of the script.

495
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:08,780
I met directors who would say,
"these are mine and nobody else's,”

496
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:13,911
to us youngsters, and
we had to step aside.

497
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,912
They would say it out loud,

498
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,324
but he never said anything like that.

499
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:23,587
I met a girlfriend he had for some years.

500
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,213
He treated her nicely.

501
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,252
But women were unsatisfied, because
he didn't spend much time with them.

502
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,092
He wasted time talking too much.

503
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,724
Lucio was a skillful talker,

504
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,850
he could talk about everything.

505
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,222
We were in Sarajevo to shoot aenigma.

506
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,390
We stayed at the holiday inn, the hotel

507
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,275
where all the journalists lodged
during the war in the Balkans.

508
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,277
The interiors were all glass.

509
00:31:48,782 --> 00:31:53,367
Who did I catch slipping away?
And I called everybody, of course!

510
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:57,951
Dad, who was sneaking in to the room
of one of those very young girls.

511
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,868
He shamelessly denied
it and went on denying.

512
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,162
We had seen him going into the room,
and he didn't come out.

513
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:09,708
I was patrolling outside the room,
but he kept on denying it.

514
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,878
Did he ever fall in love
with one of his actresses?

515
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,889
He did fall in love with an actress

516
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:17,845
who worked with him on several occasions,

517
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,932
but she was very young, very pretty,

518
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,311
and had a boyfriend.

519
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:27,567
One day I was in a stationery shop with
dad. He never went to a stationery shop!

520
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:31,606
I found him at the till holding a little
Teddy with “Christmas love” written on it.

521
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,238
He had gone totally daft.

522
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,399
He would sit next to me on my bed

523
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,996
and say, “Camilla,
shall I call or shall I not?”

524
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:45,665
“Will she call or will she not?”
acting like a 12 year-old, and he was 60!

525
00:32:46,548 --> 00:32:49,039
You only told me about young girls,

526
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,742
but what about “old woman 1”
and “old woman 2,” who are they?

527
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:56,296
That's not easy, you know.
“Old woman 1” and “old woman 2,”

528
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:02,602
in his address book they replaced
the actual names under “v.”

529
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:06,515
“Old woman 2” was a mystery to me,

530
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,605
maybe because she
wasn't exactly attractive.

531
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:12,692
I wouldn't say ugly,
but she wasn't beautiful.

532
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:17,701
I don't know why dad had
something with this lady.

533
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:22,160
“Old woman 1” was a very beautiful woman,
although of a certain age,

534
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,700
a famous psychotherapist.

535
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:32,174
There were many anecdotes about dad,
I doubt they were all true.

536
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:36,462
I don't believe dad would
have gone for 'dances.'

537
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,026
you know, in psychotherapy they do
these sort of 'dances, ' like yoga.

538
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:41,474
I can't see him doing that.

539
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,807
Dad couldn't lift up a finger.

540
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,189
And there was this thing,

541
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:49,691
a sex thing,

542
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,942
where she would tie him to a table.

543
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:57,282
C'mon... dad didn't use
to reveal intimate details,

544
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,657
but he said that this woman
would tie him to a table.

545
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:04,076
One day he called me up and said,

546
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,162
“I absolutely need to speak to you."

547
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,919
He came for dinner as usual

548
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:13,048
and said, “I met this hot chick."

549
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,876
“Where, who, how?”

550
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,845
“Stunning, young.”

551
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
I said, “lucio!”

552
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,973
“Two-meters tall!”

553
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,260
“Yeah, right, two meters...”

554
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:25,563
“Two meters!

555
00:34:25,939 --> 00:34:28,897
She's a stunning Caribbean model.”

556
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:31,057
“So? What do you wanna do with her?”

557
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,527
“I told her I want to marry her."

558
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:40,534
The next day we were off to New York
to shoot the New York ripper.

559
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:43,494
We got to New York,

560
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,248
and took a couple of days
to settle before shooting.

561
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,704
He said to me, “now,

562
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,503
come down to the lobby
because she's coming.

563
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,166
I called her, and she's
coming from the Caribbean.”

564
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,585
The taxi pulled in,

565
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,676
stuffed to the roof with
trunks, suitcases and all that.

566
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,638
Lucio looked at me and turned white.

567
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,849
The following day, he
took me aside and said,

568
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:12,107
“listen, I need you to do me a favor."

569
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,402
“Okay,” I said.

570
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:18,405
“You have to call me
up from your hotel room."

571
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,782
Our rooms were as follows:

572
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,362
My room,

573
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,995
the cinematographer gigi kuveiller's,

574
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,327
and lucio's room.

575
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,369
“You have to pretend to by my lawyer,

576
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,751
a sicilian,

577
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:34,913
and you have to speak up

578
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:38,333
because I'll place the receiver
so that she can hear!"

579
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,252
I rang lucio's room.

580
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,921
“Hello lucio!

581
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,262
I'm the lawyer."

582
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,887
And he goes, "hello, all good?"

583
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,354
“Your wife is not gonna Grant
you the divorce. You cannot remarry."

584
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:56,021
"What?" he said.

585
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:59,981
“Nope, you cannot
remarry, forget about it!"

586
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,320
The day after, on the set,
gigi kuveiller,

587
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:07,158
who we called 'Hitchcock' because
he was always very collected,

588
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,288
looked at us and went,

589
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,075
“you have to explain
something to me.

590
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:16,163
Last night I was in my room,

591
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:19,841
and I heard lucio talking to his lawyer.

592
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:24,175
But I also heard the lawyer talking
back to him, how is that possible?"

593
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:29,059
And I said, “gigi, that
was me, speaking sicilian."

594
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:32,187
“So how did it go with the girl?"

595
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,524
And lucio said,

596
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:39,312
“I paid for her flight back to the
Caribbean with Columbia airlines.”

597
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,774
“What did she say?”

598
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,359
“She said,

599
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,068
'tu es un misérable."

600
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,911
Sergio salvati's life has been
luckier than lucio fulci's.

601
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:56,545
He had his wife berenice sparano
at his side his whole life.

602
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,799
Berenice met fulci before salvati.

603
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,959
She worked with him as a costume designer.

604
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,174
We always got on.

605
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:13,141
I used to ask him first
before doing anything.

606
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,726
"Is it okay if I do this and that?"

607
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,435
He used to say, "il trust you."

608
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:21,979
And I'd say, "I need to know before going
on the set and realizing you don't like it.

609
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:27,777
It's better to say it beforehand
so that we're both free afterward."

610
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,570
One day he called me at de paolis studios

611
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:34,162
and said, “listen, I don't know what to do,

612
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,827
I have nothing more to wear.”

613
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,964
“What do you mean
you have nothing to wear?"

614
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:44,968
“Look, berenice, please do me a favor.
You're the only one I can ask

615
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,845
because you're a good person.

616
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:54,144
I have no more clean shirts.
I don't even know if they are clean or not.

617
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:59,559
I took a full suitcase,
please see what you can do."

618
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,193
This softened me tremendously,

619
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:07,700
because I realized he
didn't have anybody else

620
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,906
to count on.

621
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:14,915
I felt sorry for this man,

622
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,795
because I realized his loneliness,

623
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:23,548
despite being a lively man

624
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:27,631
full of savoir vivre.

625
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:34,218
"I've filled my 64 years of life
with women, life, stuff.

626
00:38:34,521 --> 00:38:36,432
I'm an absolute misogynist.

627
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,687
I grew up looking at

628
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,315
the menstrual pads of my
mother, my aunt, and my

629
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:44,353
grandma who brought me up
and financially supported me.

630
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,237
I fathered women,

631
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:47,898
I had women,

632
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:50,567
therefore misogyny
had to be part of my life.

633
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,610
C'mon!"

634
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,414
I imagined your house differently.

635
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,838
I was almost afraid of you,

636
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,049
based on your films, the
way you interpreted them.

637
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,349
Not anymore.

638
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,104
Fabrizio de angelis, the
producer of most of the films

639
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:27,396
on which we are now focusing,

640
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:32,568
was in my opinion unintentionally,
yet necessarily, instrumental

641
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,738
to the fulfillment of fulci's destiny.

642
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:41,205
Perhaps de angelis had no idea

643
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,916
where they were going.

644
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:49,005
He set the basic conditions

645
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:54,765
for fulci to be free to shoot
these films the way he wanted.

646
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,718
I've very often heard this thing about

647
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,604
these films having great potential,

648
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,313
if only there were more
money and equipment.

649
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,944
That's not how we're supposed
to look at them by any means.

650
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:12,528
Those films were released like that because
they were supposed to be exactly that way.

651
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:17,537
He loved gory scenes,
full of blood.

652
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,699
I remember this make-up man, his name was,

653
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,497
Franco di girolamo,

654
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,538
saying,

655
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,920
"I don't know how much
blood I have to bring today,

656
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,878
because he always asks me to put on a lot."

657
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,923
This is the genre he loved the most,

658
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,716
maybe because of his inner pain,

659
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,760
maybe because of other factors.

660
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:46,058
On the outside, he
would hide these feelings

661
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,228
but on the inside, they were there.

662
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:54,115
More than once, when I went with him

663
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,994
to sperlonga, where his wife was from,

664
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:03,158
he shared this pain with me.

665
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,999
One day, on the first or
second day of shooting,

666
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:11,211
we were at de paolis studios in Rome.

667
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:15,754
We were all busy with zombie.

668
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:19,094
We were laughing because
the extras had to move around

669
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,806
in a clumsy way. They
were all keen to play the part,

670
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,815
bless them.

671
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,648
They were awfully made up as zombies.

672
00:41:30,947 --> 00:41:33,787
He came from behind and asked for
the wing with all the zombies lined up

673
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,448
to be opened.

674
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:42,990
When you see that scene, he's the one
who indicated to everyone what to do,

675
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,455
with the head like this,
slowly moving forward.

676
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,378
And we were all astonished.

677
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:52,791
The entire crew stopped for
half an hour, as they all wanted to see.

678
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,461
After zombie

679
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,050
and its success,

680
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,183
de angelis figured that dad

681
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:05,140
would make him a lot of money.

682
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:10,355
But he noticed dad wasn't that happy
and he couldn't understand why.

683
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:16,694
They used to say, “we'll make you
do something else." Other producers,

684
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,109
perhaps they would have paid him less,

685
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:23,030
and dad was always afraid to ask.

686
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,913
It's just not who he was.

687
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:29,293
I'm exactly the same, I get dead shy.

688
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:35,633
Zombie was like an athanor,

689
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:40,513
a furnace containing a mix of
different components all thrown in.

690
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:47,771
A blend of single elements,
apparently all quite wobbly,

691
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:55,313
yet nicely blending together
to generate this extraordinary film,

692
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:00,029
a horror film with almost
a touch of western.

693
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:03,786
But most of all, an incredibly
colorful and bright movie.

694
00:43:04,082 --> 00:43:08,121
Even the color of the blood
is beautiful in zombie.

695
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:16,133
The zombie soundtrack is
definitely one of the strangest,

696
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:21,046
because it's like a "making-of."
While my idea was taking shape,

697
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:23,222
the theme of the eye

698
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:25,930
actually sprang up from my love

699
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:30,939
for the bridge in sgt.
Pepper's "a day in the life,"

700
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:35,898
something that for me is
still fundamental to this day.

701
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:41,408
The descriptive capacity of the melody
is Paramount, even in a horror movie.

702
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:46,617
You can't just have noises,
or induce fear with sound effects.

703
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:51,580
I believe we all have a
sort of switch inside of us.

704
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,479
If you can magically manage to press it,

705
00:43:54,006 --> 00:44:00,753
it puts you in a
deeply reflective mode.

706
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:03,884
On the set of city of the living dead,

707
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:06,048
both as an actor and as an assistant,

708
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,888
there was the young Michele soavi.

709
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:12,476
Fulci said that soavi
was his only possible heir.

710
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:16,939
Today, Michele soavi is one of the
most important Italian film directors.

711
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:20,275
Films are often shot in
sequences out of chronological order.

712
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,736
Therefore, on my first day of shooting

713
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,595
I already had to be
made up as a zombie,

714
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:28,492
even though that was
the last scene of the film.

715
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:32,454
The first time I saw fulci in full action

716
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:37,213
was around 3 pm, for my scene's rehearsal.

717
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,251
At one point I looked at
him, in my zombie makeup,

718
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:42,554
and fulci said,

719
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:44,383
"why are you looking
at me? Go to your spot!"

720
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,383
Good morning, lucio
fulci! Welcome to the set!

721
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,348
I do remember him as a grumpy man,

722
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,262
like everybody used to say.

723
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:57,434
The crew was fairly terrified of him.

724
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:02,356
He especially picked on the
main actress, antonella interlenghi,

725
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:07,823
not only because she was
the daughter of a famous actor,

726
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:10,461
but also because she
was a bit of a prima Donna.

727
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:13,199
I remember his almost sadistic attitude

728
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,413
during a scene where someone,

729
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:18,163
I can't remember who,

730
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,459
had to put worms in her mouth or something,

731
00:45:22,762 --> 00:45:26,175
and fulci wanted to do it himself.

732
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:30,592
Another time, in a night scene

733
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,510
there was the role of a doctor,

734
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,429
with just a couple of cues.

735
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,774
Fulci didn't like him because he was bad.

736
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:42,233
He started to shout and
tell everybody to fuck off.

737
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,235
He said, “I'll be the doctor.”

738
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:49,118
He didn't even know one
cue, nor a smidge of english,

739
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:55,454
so instead of saying “2, 3, 4, 5, 6,”
to be dubbed afterwards,

740
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,744
he started to tell everybody to fuck off,

741
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,629
here and there.

742
00:46:00,925 --> 00:46:02,665
"Go to hell!" And so on.

743
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,460
He stormed off with this briefcase,
knowing full well

744
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,800
he was going to dub his own voice.

745
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,307
His verbal outrage was just

746
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,593
his way to get his
emotions out of his system.

747
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,845
Has he ever praised you?

748
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:21,727
Maestro fulci did once
give me a star, I think,

749
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,862
not as an actor but as a camera assistant.

750
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:31,073
We were shooting in a derelict house
with a lot of wind effects.

751
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,158
There were some enormous fans,

752
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:39,077
and at some point the wind blew
a paper sheet onto a window,

753
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,336
covering the view.

754
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:45,466
Action had already started though,
so I leaped out like a cat

755
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:49,219
before the camera could frame it,
and I snatched that thing off.

756
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,756
The maestro looked at me, after shooting.

757
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:53,890
“Well done, soavi!”

758
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:58,646
I think that was the first medal
the maestro awarded me.

759
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,518
When my agent introduced me to Saigon,

760
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,154
he told me that the guy had written
"the new movie by Saigon"

761
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,736
on the poster of his second film.

762
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:13,369
When people await the release of
your new film, it means you count.

763
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,031
It took fulci over 20
years worth of filmmaking

764
00:47:17,335 --> 00:47:20,372
before having that
written on a movie poster.

765
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:26,875
The mystery of the beyond
is the mystery of one color

766
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:29,590
that tibetans would identify
as the color of the bard.

767
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,848
It's a mix of grey, light
blue and turquoise.

768
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,682
That's the color of the infinity

769
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,181
which the protagonists walk into
at the end of the film.

770
00:47:41,442 --> 00:47:46,937
But it's also the mystery
of an 'absolute' film.

771
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:52,279
In the Latin meaning of the word,
absolutus, it means "released, freed."

772
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:55,570
It's a film freed from everything.

773
00:47:55,873 --> 00:48:00,037
When he asked me to do
the beyond,

774
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:03,203
I was petrified.

775
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:06,172
I didn't know what to do.

776
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,709
We managed to represent
the beyond with nothing,

777
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:15,598
nothing at all, just a bit of sand, water,
and the heat from the lamps on the Bridges.

778
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,636
We spent the entire filming thinking
about what the afterlife might look like.

779
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:25,934
None of us could answer that.
The set designer, the editor,

780
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,195
myself, lucio, none of us.

781
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:31,196
What is the beyond?

782
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,282
Then I had an idea.

783
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:39,447
I worked flat out for days, on my breaks,
in the evenings, with the crew technicians,

784
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,162
the camera assistant, and two electricians,

785
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,744
to try and work out how to do it.

786
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,473
The soundtrack of the beyond is complex.

787
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,475
It's made of many things, and characters,

788
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,643
and different emotions
clearly spelled out one by one.

789
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,935
The out-of-tune piano was inevitable,
but the idea came by chance

790
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,570
while we were on the set.

791
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:16,735
Emily was rehearsing her walk through
the house, and I was visiting the set.

792
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,153
Like a kid, I saw an old piano,

793
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,790
opened it, and started to fiddle
with it during a break.

794
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:28,997
Obviously it was totally out of tune,
as it was just a piece of the set design.

795
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,044
Lucio heard it and said, “that's it, fabio.
That's just what I need."

796
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,758
That's how the idea came
out to write this crazy thing

797
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:39,514
that has been making
pianists insane ever since

798
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,300
when they play it.

799
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,688
We all think of the
afterlife as something grave,

800
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,320
but we very much hope it exists.

801
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:58,986
That final scene... speaking of
Sergio salvati, who I not only admire

802
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:02,200
but I'm also very fond
of, he's a first-class artist.

803
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,162
It hits me every time I watch it,
even when I play it in concert.

804
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,821
I have it right in front me, and
when it reaches that point,

805
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:12,707
it gets me. It moves me, because
the great magic of a finished film

806
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:19,381
is that you feel as if you
were in another place.

807
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,722
That's a scene which has always
swept me away to that place.

808
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:29,766
The color of the sky John and Lisa
walk towards, stayed inside me so deeply

809
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:34,312
that every time I look
up and I see that sky,

810
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:38,274
that for me is the sky of the beyond.

811
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:43,617
It takes me back to the
same mysterious place

812
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:48,751
the two blind protagonists walk towards.

813
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,084
Dad was wonderful with kids.

814
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,499
He loved them,

815
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,508
especially with my nephew

816
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,295
gabriele, aka lele,

817
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:01,889
a beloved nephew.

818
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:07,804
He would roll on the floor with lele, do
things he'd never done before with me.

819
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,814
He had a very special bond with lele,

820
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:15,274
a very strong one in his life.

821
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:19,407
His boat named "antonilla,"

822
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,442
antonella and Camilla,

823
00:51:23,998 --> 00:51:27,206
was renamed "lele."

824
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,207
The second boat was named "lele dui,"

825
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:33,746
because my nephew used to say "lele dui"
to indicate his 2 years of age.

826
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:37,667
Then, when lele couldn't
stay with us anymore,

827
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:41,713
for various reasons,

828
00:51:42,016 --> 00:51:43,016
"ex lele."

829
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:51,473
I never fully grasped
fulci's relationship with kids,

830
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:56,235
but I don't think it
was a plain one at all.

831
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:01,570
You can tell he had something with kids,
something very violent inside of him

832
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,611
that revives with the images of kids.

833
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:12,160
Although in the end kids survive and are
the only ones coming out of the inferno.

834
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:19,175
Freudstein's extraordinary features in
the house by the cemetery

835
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:22,337
were meant to look like

836
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:30,640
a sort of former union soldier with
the head and the body of an insect.

837
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:39,479
And the end, where
catriona is trying to get out

838
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,364
through that narrow
gap that would not budge,

839
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,525
that stuff is incredible.

840
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:51,950
It's the sum of fulci's raging
cruelty and savagery,

841
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:55,164
like perhaps never before
seen in his films.

842
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:59,416
One of the things I loved about fulci

843
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,509
was his hedgehog hair.

844
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:06,923
In those days there were shops where you
could buy cuckoo clocks, and little dolls

845
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:11,310
and teddies with fulci-like hair.

846
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:14,438
We found two or three of
those, absolutely marvelous.

847
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:19,523
Dad bought them for fulci, and it was
funny to see him with those teddies,

848
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:22,063
because they really looked like his sons.

849
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,482
It made me and Carlo laugh out loud.

850
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,452
There is a moment in the psychic

851
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,832
where the revelation of a mystery
is hidden in the date of a newspaper.

852
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:37,537
It features a picture with
a woman in the foreground

853
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,047
and, behind her, a young woman riding.

854
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,133
That young woman is Camilla fulci.

855
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:48,054
Camilla and her father shared
a big passion for horse riding.

856
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:52,764
Dad's love of horses began

857
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,769
in more innocent times,

858
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,522
when the partner of my
grandma, dad's mom,

859
00:53:57,818 --> 00:54:00,104
renato sassoli,

860
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:02,941
used to have a racing stable.

861
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:07,279
My dad used to live with them as a boy.

862
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:10,445
That passion started
again when I came along.

863
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:14,411
I started horse riding
when I was seven and a half,

864
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,663
and he was always there.

865
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,580
He used to come and see me,
and he was very proud.

866
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,295
He would have bought a
horse for me if he could afford it.

867
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,672
"Me, fat with a pipe.

868
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,385
Camilla, our little one,

869
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,721
she was ten years old."

870
00:54:47,201 --> 00:54:51,160
Perhaps fulci's passion for
horses was something aristocratic

871
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:54,197
for a director of popular films.

872
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:59,877
It became a legacy to
pass on to his younger daughter,

873
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:09,762
A passion that stayed
with him until his last days,

874
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:13,549
through thick and thin.

875
00:55:17,189 --> 00:55:23,856
Lucio was always happy amongst
horses in any scene on the set.

876
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:32,738
He truly loved them, and
used to call them by name.

877
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,325
On the set of silver saddle he used
to show the actor giuliano Gemma

878
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:42,586
exactly how to ride,
how to vault onto a horse.

879
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:48,547
Lucio loved horse race betting.

880
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:53,301
Camilla told me about plenty of moments
in her life, back in her horse racing days,

881
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,218
about her trips with
her father to buy horses.

882
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,479
Out of all those episodes, needless to say,

883
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:04,016
her horse riding accident is
the one that hit me the most.

884
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,645
It was a life-changer,
for her and the whole family.

885
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,913
“Back then Camilla had
been riding for a year.

886
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:24,328
She was still too little to be a rider,

887
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:28,249
and she was not as brave as she
would be later on, unfortunately.”

888
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:35,222
I used to ride horses.
We had racing horses.

889
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:39,476
Unfortunately I would also
ride freshly trained horses,

890
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,181
not yet fully tamed.

891
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:46,768
One morning, I fell
from a thoroughbred.

892
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:48,860
Dad was there that morning.

893
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,565
A gate was left open by mistake,

894
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,656
and the horse skidded at 60 km/h.

895
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:00,201
I was thrown off and
broke the fence with my back.

896
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,193
Dad and everybody else came running.

897
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:08,502
I wasn't crying. I still
had my full helmet on.

898
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,165
I felt as if my legs were bent.

899
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:15,713
The first thing I managed to
say to dad and the instructor,

900
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:20,012
I remember that one thing very well.

901
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:23,054
“L broke my back."

902
00:57:23,357 --> 00:57:24,917
Then I couldn't remember anything else.

903
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,854
I do remember the
hospital, the plaster corset,

904
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,482
and dad always being there.

905
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:38,449
He was in tears when
he told us, on the set.

906
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:43,832
We learned about the accident,
and her being taken to the hospital.

907
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:51,090
He was crying, and I don't know
if he said something bad about horses.

908
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:56,470
I remember he burst
out in front of everybody.

909
00:57:56,765 --> 00:58:04,479
Before I left in 1976,
I called him up to say goodbye,

910
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:08,731
and when I phoned him

911
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:17,158
I learned about Camilla's tragic news,
her fall from the horse and the paralysis.

912
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,657
I was shocked.

913
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,869
I still am to this day.

914
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:31,463
Dad dreamed twice of having his hair cut.

915
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,464
He used to tell us this story

916
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,756
about a dream he'd had
about having his hair shaved.

917
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,215
After that, my mom died.

918
00:58:39,141 --> 00:58:42,258
Then he dreamed of
having his sideburns cut,

919
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:44,802
and that's when I fell.

920
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:55,146
“Camilla's first style jumping,
a strutted, dignified ride.”

921
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:01,778
Miraculously, Camilla was able
to walk again for many years,

922
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:07,074
until she was hit by a relentless disease

923
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,787
that left its Mark on her forever.

924
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:18,924
The New York ripper was
the only film that truly disturbed me,

925
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:27,222
for the practice of violence
on bodies. You could really feel it,

926
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:30,769
and still can, if you re-watch it.

927
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:34,981
Fulci's rage in the way

928
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:41,867
he represented the violence,

929
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:45,996
even nastiness, was almost linkable to

930
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:51,081
some resentment fulci
had against beautiful women.

931
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:56,999
The main character, the duck,
the murderer, is a father who kills

932
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,920
because his daughter is rotting,
bedridden in a hospital bit by bit,

933
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,965
to say it as things were.

934
01:00:06,228 --> 01:00:09,561
Who knows how much there is of
Camilla in the daughter of the ripper.

935
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:15,772
Was fulci making those films to exorcise
his pain for his daughter's accident?

936
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,353
The original plot of the movie

937
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,148
was about a murderer who
would kill because of mental issues.

938
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:26,241
Fulci changed this. The
ripper was not mentally insane,

939
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,203
it was the unfairness of his daughter's
misfortune that drove him to kill.

940
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:33,585
I'd just finished school,

941
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,792
and dad said, “listen,

942
01:00:37,092 --> 01:00:39,549
what do you wanna do now?
Keep on studying or work?”

943
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:41,255
Just like that, Roman style.

944
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,051
I didn't have to think too long about it.

945
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,430
“I want to work.”

946
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:51,269
I was curious about cinema.
I had seen so much of it,

947
01:00:51,565 --> 01:00:53,806
but I'd never really been in it.

948
01:00:54,109 --> 01:01:00,651
I wanted to know what pictures were all
about, what dad was giving his whole life to.

949
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:04,988
If I hadn't gone into cinema,
my dream would have been to be a vet,

950
01:01:05,287 --> 01:01:08,279
or many other things,

951
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:10,781
like a horsemaster,

952
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,372
going to the states and specializing.
That was my dream.

953
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,754
But I have no regrets whatsoever,

954
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,664
absolutely none.

955
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:21,583
It's the nicest job in the world.

956
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,586
Rome 2033 - the fighter centurions,

957
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:26,838
that was a circus!

958
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:30,600
I remember the steps
inside helios film.

959
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:35,139
I remember going up and down
with scripts, folders and stuff.

960
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:38,809
That was the true
understanding of filmmaking,

961
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,986
the chaos and the beauty of it.

962
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:44,042
That wasn't just fiddling
around with papers.

963
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:47,780
It was a sequence of
meaningful moments, nice.

964
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:54,917
You said that your father was obsessed
with being on top of things.

965
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,168
What does that mean?

966
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:00,627
I've always had this thing in my head
about getting the time right.

967
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:03,633
It's difficult to get it right though.

968
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:06,386
Dad used to say, "look, that
guy is not on top of things."

969
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:11,842
In his opinion,
I was on top of things.

970
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,601
We were shooting murder rock in Rome.

971
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:24,738
I was approached by the production staff.

972
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:29,993
“Camilla, would you like to go to new
York, unpaid, only a daily allowance?”

973
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:32,112
I didn't let them finish the question.

974
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,996
I was ready in no time.

975
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:38,122
On the plane we bumped into enrico vanzina.
I was introduced to him

976
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:42,539
because dad had a nice bond with
the sons of steno, his great master.

977
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,675
He adored him, and was
always very grateful to him.

978
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:47,198
He had a nice relationship
with them, because

979
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:48,883
he'd spent time with
them over the years.

980
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:54,009
We last bumped into each
other on that famous plane.

981
01:02:54,312 --> 01:02:57,520
Fulci himself used to
tell this story. It happened

982
01:02:57,816 --> 01:03:00,728
by chance. We didn't
know he was on our plane.

983
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:04,485
A total coincidence. It was emotional,

984
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:07,989
because I used to know him
when I was a boy, and now we

985
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:11,573
were on the same plane and
I'd become a film-maker too.

986
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:16,080
In those few words we exchanged,
in the fondness we showed to each other,

987
01:03:16,376 --> 01:03:21,712
with a moving handshake and maybe a pat,

988
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,373
there was a whole history of humanity.

989
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:28,502
After murder rock, something happened

990
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,389
in a very trivial way.

991
01:03:32,684 --> 01:03:36,552
Dad had a heart attack.

992
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,605
I took him to the gemelli
polyclinic to have surgery.

993
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,980
We were waiting for this
famous surgeon, Dr. baruffi,

994
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:47,946
to return from his work in Baltimore

995
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,482
to perform this very complicated surgery.

996
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:52,665
I believe it was the
first of its kind in Italy,

997
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:54,386
the reconstruction
of half of dad's heart.

998
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,327
We were all very happy and optimistic,

999
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,163
but then the wait became longer and longer.

1000
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:07,333
He had to assess whether to
wake him up, he was all intubated.

1001
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:10,422
When Dr. baruffi came out
of the intensive care ward,

1002
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:13,259
he took me to one side.

1003
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,220
I sensed something was wrong.

1004
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:21,646
He said, "look Camilla, it's serious,
we need to operate again."

1005
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:26,480
Right then, when baruffi told me that,

1006
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,948
I saw death standing before me.
It was a great blow to me.

1007
01:04:32,243 --> 01:04:35,701
It was like facing death,
my death.

1008
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:43,869
He told me he had to
have open-heart surgery.

1009
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:49,629
He said it with his usual irony,

1010
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:55,889
to disguise what was
coming, especially to himself.

1011
01:04:56,184 --> 01:05:04,184
Before and after the operation he thought
he wasn't going to make it. It was hard,

1012
01:05:08,613 --> 01:05:14,153
very hard. I actually thought
he wasn't going to make it.

1013
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:19,867
When eventually everything
went well, the operation and all,

1014
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:24,747
he had a stroke of bad luck.
A damned blood transfusion

1015
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:29,547
gave him viral hepatitis.

1016
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:33,710
When dad had a heart attack,

1017
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,800
he didn't want me to tell anybody

1018
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,494
he was in the hospital, not a word.

1019
01:05:38,518 --> 01:05:42,010
He said to me, “Camilla,
I don't want anybody

1020
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,053
in the film industry knowing I'm not well.

1021
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,440
I'm afraid they're not
gonna let me work anymore."

1022
01:05:49,446 --> 01:05:54,031
It's sad, but I think
only he knew why.

1023
01:05:55,660 --> 01:06:01,451
Our lives went separate ways
as lucio had a break.

1024
01:06:01,749 --> 01:06:06,413
We were apart for a while,
not because we wanted to be,

1025
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:11,628
but for work logistics, because he
was making films back to back.

1026
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,340
“L'occhio del testimone”
was the first book about lucio fulci,

1027
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,722
the only one published
when he was still alive.

1028
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:24,344
Michele romagnoli was 20,
dreaming of becoming a filmmaker,

1029
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,356
and ended up becoming
lucio fulci's biographer.

1030
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,937
That's what the maestro
used to call Michele.

1031
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,276
Michele hasn't spoken about
his relationship with fulci since,

1032
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:40,911
but he has very generously
decided to do it today with me.

1033
01:06:41,206 --> 01:06:47,076
I set off to Rome with
the intention of attending

1034
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:52,623
the filmmaking school
and meeting lucio fulci.

1035
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,212
He agreed to meet me.

1036
01:06:55,512 --> 01:07:02,384
My excuse was an interview for the
presentation of voices from beyond.

1037
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,142
Then fulci began to phone me often.

1038
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:09,272
He used to say, “romagnoli,
are you scratching your belly?”

1039
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:14,186
In the way we say it in bologna.

1040
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:20,576
I wanted to keep this relationship going
and try to see him as much as possible,

1041
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:25,990
because he was a real mentor to me.

1042
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:32,538
He taught me how to get around on
the set and many filmmaking tricks.

1043
01:07:33,216 --> 01:07:37,175
But I couldn't justify this
mentoring anymore, so I told him

1044
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:40,671
I wanted to write a book about him.

1045
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:48,392
He said, “Michele, it's not a good
deal for you. I'm not dead yet."

1046
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,184
The first film after dad's illness
was the devil's honey,

1047
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:55,818
shot in Barcelona,

1048
01:07:56,114 --> 01:07:57,399
in sitges.

1049
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:01,442
After the surgery,
during the film production,

1050
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,076
he said to me, "Camilla, I'm so scared!"

1051
01:08:04,372 --> 01:08:07,614
He had a tiny laser incision.

1052
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:09,578
You could hardly see it.

1053
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,290
I came out with some foundation
to cover it, and nobody noticed.

1054
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:16,423
He was nervous, but it
was all good in the end.

1055
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:23,513
Here I'm shown with a beard
and a coat bought at sitges,

1056
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:28,389
and a hat bought in Barcelona.
Successful shopping in Spain!

1057
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:33,273
Camilla, have you ever thought
of becoming a film director?

1058
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:38,149
- He gave me a script once,
the title was nhf: No human factor.

1059
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:40,814
A nice, beautiful idea,

1060
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:45,702
it still sounds fresh today,
easily doable, even now.

1061
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:52,041
It was a fantasy film, and could
be turned into horror if you wanted it to,

1062
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:55,829
horror or somehow violent.

1063
01:08:56,466 --> 01:09:00,675
You could do anything with that film,
the script was truly versatile.

1064
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:06,135
He said that it was a female film.
He used to say that some movies are female.

1065
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,846
That's perhaps one of my few regrets,

1066
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:11,511
maybe the only regret
I've ever had in my life,

1067
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:14,222
but I didn't feel ready for it.

1068
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:18,393
It was too big of a challenge,
a Titanic one.

1069
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,652
I really couldn't do it.

1070
01:09:20,948 --> 01:09:23,530
Such a shame,
as I regret it now.

1071
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,386
What did your father say when
you decided not to make the film?

1072
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,579
Nothing,

1073
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:28,747
nothing...

1074
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,120
How did you tell him?

1075
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:32,748
I told him I wasn't up for it.

1076
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,410
At that time I wasn't up for it.

1077
01:09:35,797 --> 01:09:37,037
What did he say?

1078
01:09:37,674 --> 01:09:40,711
Absolutely nothing, that's the problem.

1079
01:09:41,552 --> 01:09:45,761
Fulci's following movies
were like a deflating balloon,

1080
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:48,673
and I can't find an explanation for that.

1081
01:09:48,976 --> 01:09:54,687
The comparison is often
made to Dario argento's films.

1082
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:59,100
Fans turned away at some point,

1083
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:06,401
considering them to be rubbish.
But somehow Dario managed to keep

1084
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:11,743
a technical dignity

1085
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,908
that fulci, in my opinion, did not.

1086
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:20,296
It isn't so much a
change of the directing eye,

1087
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:25,130
but more of the
so-called contributing

1088
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,342
circumstances, which
didn't allow fulci to

1089
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:32,008
make movies like he
used to a few years before.

1090
01:10:34,105 --> 01:10:37,893
I was keen to have the
book out as soon as possible,

1091
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:46,192
because I was sure it could help
the image of fulci the filmmaker.

1092
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:51,869
One night he called me up and said,

1093
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:56,249
“romagnoli, I have the title for our book,

1094
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,502
it's "the eye of the witness."

1095
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:04,257
Then I knew he understood
what I wanted to achieve.

1096
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:10,263
From that point, my interviews were no
longer interviews, but long conversations,

1097
01:11:11,225 --> 01:11:17,061
from cinema topics to more private chats.

1098
01:11:17,356 --> 01:11:20,473
“Romagnoli, you understand
me like no one else,

1099
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:23,644
you'll forever be my
official biographer."

1100
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,782
I have to say that
I've always felt like I was,

1101
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:33,194
as I managed to carve
out things from that man

1102
01:11:33,498 --> 01:11:37,457
that otherwise would
have been lost forever.

1103
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:41,836
He appreciated it.

1104
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:45,840
“At least you, romagnoli,
discovered me while I'm still alive."

1105
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:54,265
They say that a cat in the brain,
today a huge cult film worldwide,

1106
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,767
is somehow your film.

1107
01:11:57,063 --> 01:11:58,063
Is that true?

1108
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:03,149
This film was a special
experiment for dad.

1109
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:07,278
He liked the idea very much.

1110
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:12,780
I took everything on my shoulders. I was
the general supervisor, assistant director,

1111
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,364
all sorts of jobs! Everything!

1112
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:16,745
And on some occasions

1113
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:21,910
I know that dad praised me
a lot for this film.

1114
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:24,920
And I'm obviously pleased
that you recognize it too,

1115
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:31,299
but it was a commercial production.
I think it came out nicely,

1116
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:33,797
dad acting,

1117
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,012
with his usual fixations.
"Am I pulling faces?"

1118
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:40,678
Every time he acted in a cameo, he
used to say, "Camilla, did I pull faces?"

1119
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,431
Dad was a big surprise,
even for me, in that film,

1120
01:12:43,734 --> 01:12:46,692
because he was a proper actor,

1121
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,980
not just a cameo. He amazed me a lot.

1122
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:53,525
At first, he wasn't supposed
to play the main role, right?

1123
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:56,823
I think, deep down,

1124
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:02,334
in that case it was like
once in a lifetime.

1125
01:13:02,879 --> 01:13:07,339
It was a challenge he wanted
to take on, make it or break it.

1126
01:13:09,343 --> 01:13:14,337
Fulci used to say a cat in the brain
was his daughter's production masterpiece.

1127
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:19,134
All the people who worked with Camilla
have the nicest words for her.

1128
01:13:19,854 --> 01:13:24,393
They say she was professional,
efficient, shy, and quiet.

1129
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,932
I can't imagine her being silent.

1130
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:30,440
Every time I meet her,
she's a torrent of witty words.

1131
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:37,076
She says she now speaks as if her father
were speaking on her behalf. I believe her.

1132
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:44,580
Michele romagnoli persuaded fulci

1133
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:48,622
to propose door to silence to
producer aristide massaccesi.

1134
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,834
Unfortunately, that was fulci's last film.

1135
01:13:54,305 --> 01:13:58,639
That time around he believed he could finally
make his comeback on the big screen,

1136
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:02,894
because massaccesi's
productions were out in cinemas.

1137
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:06,939
Unfortunately, that film
was dragged into the

1138
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:10,317
fall of filmirage, the
production company.

1139
01:14:11,322 --> 01:14:14,689
Door to silence was
practically never released,

1140
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:20,032
and in the end, he
didn't like it that much.

1141
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:24,123
We were shooting door to silence.

1142
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:29,496
He said to me, “we need to choose
the main actor. One option is John savage."

1143
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:31,255
“Oh dad! John savage!”

1144
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,550
He was my idol.

1145
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:36,969
"The hunter", this blond guy. I usually
didn't like blondes, but he was a legend,

1146
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,596
with his longish hair,

1147
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:43,885
his beautiful face. Who
didn't like John savage?

1148
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:45,303
But there was a problem.

1149
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:49,315
There was a John savage
'before' and a John savage 'after.'

1150
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:50,895
who was the other candidate?

1151
01:14:51,195 --> 01:14:53,982
I chose John savage, I didn't
even hear the second option,

1152
01:14:54,281 --> 01:14:55,691
because he was my idol.

1153
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,823
Guess who the other candidate was?

1154
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,119
Gene hackman.

1155
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:08,246
In 1993 fulci was invited to receive the
honorary award at the fantafestival

1156
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:13,172
in Rome. Asia argento was
on stage presenting the award,

1157
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:19,053
and she called her father
Dario argento to the stage.

1158
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:23,053
Fulci was next to me in a wheelchair.

1159
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:27,095
When argento called his name, fulci got up.

1160
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:33,227
I don't know how, with great effort he
reached the stage and they hugged.

1161
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:38,565
In the following days he told
me that argento called him up

1162
01:15:38,868 --> 01:15:42,326
and proposed a project to work on together.

1163
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:48,457
In 1994 I had the pleasure to have fulci
again as a guest at a festival

1164
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,790
in the ferrara area,
where I was born and bred.

1165
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:55,581
Together with effects artist Sergio
stivaletti and other guests,

1166
01:15:55,885 --> 01:16:02,927
they talked about that project a lot,

1167
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:08,970
enough to have a storyboard
of some scenes already in place.

1168
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:12,731
And they were actually made in the end.

1169
01:16:13,027 --> 01:16:16,645
However, this memory of his vitality

1170
01:16:16,947 --> 01:16:21,111
clashes with his real
state of health at the time.

1171
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,947
He disguised the fact
that he was not feeling well.

1172
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:28,455
He called me a few months before he died,

1173
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:31,037
full-on keen to make that film.

1174
01:16:31,754 --> 01:16:34,291
He was keeping me
up-to-date with the production.

1175
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:39,175
My regret is that he told me

1176
01:16:39,470 --> 01:16:43,964
this time I was going to
be his assistant director.

1177
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,427
Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

1178
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:51,057
Fulci believed very much
in that film, the wax mask.

1179
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:56,101
I was with berenice when
he called me up and said,

1180
01:16:56,403 --> 01:17:03,821
“I'm going to pick up this film produced
by argento, although it's a difficult one,

1181
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:09,956
a difficult character, but he's good,
I want to do it, I want the whole crew."

1182
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:17,043
We were about to prep the movie. I
was ready, and he was feeling a bit better.

1183
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,297
Then lucio died.

1184
01:17:19,969 --> 01:17:24,053
It was sorrowful for me,
but also for many others

1185
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:27,636
who loved him. Not just
his daughters, everybody.

1186
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,885
Why couldn't fulci's career be better?

1187
01:17:31,814 --> 01:17:37,901
He's also to blame for it,
because he talked too much

1188
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:45,237
about colleagues, producers, directors. He
would speak the truth right to your face,

1189
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:50,621
not between the walls with
a couple of penniless losers.

1190
01:17:51,625 --> 01:17:56,665
When lucio was gone,

1191
01:17:57,381 --> 01:18:03,468
in the evening gatherings at
friends' houses, the leitmotif

1192
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:07,843
of our conversations was
how much we missed lucio.

1193
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:20,855
I used to hang on his every word. I
adored him because lucio, as I said before,

1194
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,197
was a great storyteller
and hugely cultured.

1195
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:29,614
It wasn't like a
father-and-son relationship.

1196
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:35,250
It was more like two on the road.

1197
01:18:35,544 --> 01:18:43,544
Lucio fulci is like a constant riddle.
His memory is now more powerful than ever.

1198
01:18:44,094 --> 01:18:48,838
You just have to browse on social
media to realize that fulci's name

1199
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:52,554
always arouses massive interest.

1200
01:18:52,853 --> 01:18:59,850
Around lucio and his
memory, there's an enthusiasm

1201
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:04,316
that many other directors
and horror masters don't have.

1202
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,615
Why?

1203
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:09,032
Lucio is like a question Mark.

1204
01:19:09,328 --> 01:19:15,824
You never really know if
you can grasp his full essence.

1205
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:22,668
After door to silence,
it was all over for him and for me.

1206
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,208
I fell ill six months later,

1207
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:27,968
and within 2 and a half years my dad died.

1208
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,471
When my dad died, I was in the hospital.

1209
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:34,008
I had cervical spine surgery.

1210
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,977
I learned it when the phone rang

1211
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,347
at five o'clock in the afternoon.

1212
01:19:40,901 --> 01:19:43,142
My partner wouldn't say what had happened.

1213
01:19:43,737 --> 01:19:45,443
I was bedridden.

1214
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:54,570
My partner hung up and didn't speak.

1215
01:19:54,873 --> 01:19:57,910
I said, "Gianni, what
happened? What did they want?”

1216
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:02,123
At first he didn't speak, and then

1217
01:20:02,423 --> 01:20:05,711
he spoke up and said,
"Camilla, your father is dead!"

1218
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:10,002
I didn't cry.

1219
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:14,381
I was frozen.
I only thought, "I'm alone."

1220
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,516
I didn't think I had Gianni. No.

1221
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,303
"I'm alone," that was my first thought.

1222
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:26,102
My last memory of
lucio fulci is similar to the

1223
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:29,317
one I have of my father
when the writer longanesi died.

1224
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:34,280
It was in the 50s, I remember dad didn't go

1225
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:39,244
to work that day. He locked himself
in the study, lowered the blinds and cried.

1226
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:44,370
My last true memory
of fulci is not physical.

1227
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:48,666
The day I learned that he died,
I pretty much did the same.

1228
01:20:48,969 --> 01:20:55,841
When I'm out there and see
fondness for lucio everywhere,

1229
01:20:56,143 --> 01:21:02,855
his fans, the almost hysterical
appreciation, you can see people love him.

1230
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:08,315
They love him, full stop. And every time
I tell something, or play,

1231
01:21:08,614 --> 01:21:13,233
or I just attend the showing of a film,

1232
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:18,746
it's like he's really backstage,
and the ovation I receive

1233
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:22,909
is nothing but a fraction of the ovation
he would get if he were on the stage.

1234
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:26,294
Today lucio fulci is
acclaimed by everybody,

1235
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:30,378
but in the last years
of his life, none of the

1236
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:33,293
old producers would
offer him films to make,

1237
01:21:33,597 --> 01:21:38,808
films that today would be distributed
worldwide and make rich earnings.

1238
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,645
Thinking that his old rival Dario argento

1239
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:45,682
was the only one to try
and produce a film for

1240
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,147
him, is absurd! Tragic
and poetic at the same time.

1241
01:21:51,490 --> 01:21:55,358
Alright... time to go
and see antonella now.

1242
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,909
The only time he talked
to me about antonella,

1243
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:04,166
I said to him, “by the
way, how's antonella?”

1244
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:10,757
“Don't ask. She's getting into trouble,
she's out and about day and night.

1245
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:14,009
I do love her, but I don't
know how to show it to her,

1246
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:19,640
and perhaps she doesn't know how
to show it to me." He was talking softly.

1247
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,597
I saw him saddened. He
was not working. That was

1248
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:27,014
the first time he was
talking of his daughter, antonella.

1249
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:30,818
I hope the girls are both well.

1250
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:38,117
Lucio, let's say he didn't have
an easy relationship with women.

1251
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:45,367
He had extraordinary girlfriends, but
he was trying to be the tough one

1252
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,581
to compensate for his apparent shyness.

1253
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:52,294
So he would just shout
to prove his toughness.

1254
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:57,303
But he was very sweet with
his daughters. They weren't easy.

1255
01:22:57,598 --> 01:23:03,184
When antonella sums up her
life, she says terrifying things,

1256
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:07,183
but I've learned that just
because one made mistakes,

1257
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:11,897
it doesn't mean she's not an
exceptional person. In her, I can see

1258
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:15,484
all of lucio's features
perfectly reproduced,

1259
01:23:15,782 --> 01:23:20,276
including things not too suitable for a
woman. Maybe this isn't a compliment.

1260
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:23,696
I don't know what lucio
did for them in detail,

1261
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,457
but I believe it was
the best he could offer.

1262
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:32,838
Fabio frizzi is right. In antonella,
you can see her father's accomplishments,

1263
01:23:33,133 --> 01:23:34,839
the intelligence, the
depth, the generosity

1264
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:36,921
of a daughter who
stayed by her father's side

1265
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:40,088
in his last years, the most difficult ones,

1266
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:45,684
I stupidly met her last,
when she was actually the one

1267
01:23:45,979 --> 01:23:49,813
who told me better than anybody else
who lucio fulci truly was,

1268
01:23:50,108 --> 01:23:54,727
through her words, and the
stunning family and work footage

1269
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:56,770
her father recorded throughout his life.

1270
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,691
When did you figure out
what your father's job was?

1271
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:09,118
The moment I truly
realized what he was doing

1272
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:14,083
was during a visit on the set of
don't torture a duckling,

1273
01:24:14,383 --> 01:24:20,049
during that famous scene of florinda bolkan
covered in those little tubes.

1274
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:23,430
I was fascinated.

1275
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:29,099
For me, that was one of the
greatest games I'd ever seen,

1276
01:24:29,398 --> 01:24:31,480
all those little pumps and stuff.

1277
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:39,732
Then, I went with him to the premiere
of the film. I was young, 12 or 13.

1278
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,569
That was the real stuff.

1279
01:24:41,868 --> 01:24:47,329
It wasn't my father playing with little
tubes anymore. That's when I realized

1280
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:51,993
that perhaps I didn't understand
many things about my father until then.

1281
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:55,454
What do you think your father missed?

1282
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:57,477
What did he really want, but couldn't have?

1283
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:59,715
He missed a male child.

1284
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:05,469
This came out through his behavior.

1285
01:25:05,767 --> 01:25:11,012
Just like in the past, when
families were waiting for a son,

1286
01:25:11,315 --> 01:25:15,775
but he got two girls
instead. "Where's the boy?”

1287
01:25:16,069 --> 01:25:24,069
The lack of a male child was offset
by the birth of my eldest son.

1288
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:28,905
That's when I was convinced,
once and for all,

1289
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:33,291
that he picked on me because
he wanted me to be a boy.

1290
01:25:33,587 --> 01:25:38,832
Also my sister, he wanted her to be a boy.
What good are girls? There must be boys!

1291
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:43,252
This was a very hidden side of him.
When my son was born,

1292
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,591
I hadn't ever seen my father like that.

1293
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:48,724
There are no pictures of
him with me in his arms,

1294
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:53,763
no pictures with anybody, not even
with my mother. He wanted to stay

1295
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:59,777
behind the camera. But with this little
boy, he was like a different person.

1296
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:04,315
He spent time with him. He would
take him out to the playground.

1297
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:09,487
He'd buy sweets for him. He
was like a fairy-tale grandpa.

1298
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:13,699
Antonella, I've got to play
your father in a film about him.

1299
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,620
Is there a way to understand who
he really was? Can you help me?

1300
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:26,632
I think it's a very complicated task

1301
01:26:26,932 --> 01:26:32,643
to try to understand him. Perhaps
it's better not to. Instead, listen to him,

1302
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:39,605
watch his films, and absorb all the madness

1303
01:26:39,903 --> 01:26:45,443
in his images, which
you will take with you.

1304
01:26:45,742 --> 01:26:50,987
Even in the most puzzling
moments, when you'll ask yourself

1305
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:56,909
who he was, or what you should do, or
how he would have behaved right now,

1306
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:02,582
don't try to understand. Just imagine
you're behind the camera,

1307
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:06,126
that's when you might understand.

1308
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:19,223
The greatest filmmakers
are masters of lying,

1309
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:22,438
a sort of giving vent to their creativity,

1310
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,193
and lucio fulci was one of them.

1311
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:32,574
According to him, Brian de palma
told him that the psychic

1312
01:27:32,873 --> 01:27:36,161
was a flop, as people
didn't go to the pictures

1313
01:27:36,460 --> 01:27:40,703
because they were
afraid of the red brigades.

1314
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,297
And again, scorsese allegedly told him that

1315
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:48,962
Spielberg had been inspired by
the house by the cemetery

1316
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,129
when he conceived poltergeist.

1317
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:55,759
Then the iranian officials,
who were so impressed

1318
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:58,553
by fulci's films with
Franco and ciccio,

1319
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:01,018
allegedly offered
him the directorship

1320
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:03,650
of the national cinema
institute of Tehran,

1321
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:05,230
according to him.

1322
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:16,284
Lucio fulci created his
own myth before we did.

1323
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:22,127
This is something only
the great ones can do.

1324
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:35,385
In the very moment it is told, some
bullshit becomes immediately true.

1325
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:48,359
For example, I wonder whether the world
would have been a better or a worse place

1326
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:56,363
if what fulci used to say was actually
true, about him being asked to take part in

1327
01:28:56,665 --> 01:29:00,704
the TV quiz show "rischiatutto,”
as a contestant expert on proust.

1328
01:29:01,002 --> 01:29:09,002
But, since proust was gay,
this thing came to nothing.

1329
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:17,636
I believe that had fulci been on
"rischiatutto," as an expert on proust

1330
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:23,889
impossible, really -

1331
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:26,729
the world would have
been a much better place.

1332
01:29:39,082 --> 01:29:44,167
Dad wasn't one to show
affection with his kids.

1333
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:47,044
He never gave me a kiss on the cheek,

1334
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:50,753
no hugs. That wasn't
how he showed his love,

1335
01:29:51,052 --> 01:29:52,292
but he did it in other ways.

1336
01:29:52,596 --> 01:29:54,837
So when he was ll,

1337
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:58,598
the day we finally left the hospital,

1338
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:01,727
for the first time I saw
him particularly emotional.

1339
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:05,435
He had watery eyes. I was shaking,

1340
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:09,192
I couldn't believe it.
After all we'd went through

1341
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:11,774
fighting that battle,

1342
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:13,984
dad took my hand.

1343
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:19,278
I was almost embarrassed,
because this contact with my father,

1344
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:22,823
hand in hand, was like a hug.

1345
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,708
And I understood what he went through,

1346
01:30:26,004 --> 01:30:29,087
which is what I went through, the same.

1347
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:31,585
And right there you felt
like father and daughter.

1348
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:34,543
We were father and daughter in many ways.

1349
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:39,302
How was being fulci's
daughter when he was alive,

1350
01:30:39,601 --> 01:30:41,466
and how was it when he died?

1351
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:45,637
When he was alive, I was
like a character in his films,

1352
01:30:46,107 --> 01:30:50,225
a rather fussy one, out of frame,

1353
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:57,866
one of those who always has rows with
the director and gets kicked off the set.

1354
01:30:58,161 --> 01:31:03,576
When he sadly passed away,
I became a spectator of his films,

1355
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:07,743
and of the emotions they
produced in the audience.

1356
01:31:08,171 --> 01:31:13,131
In my case, he was more of a director,

1357
01:31:13,426 --> 01:31:17,886
not the typical parent

1358
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:21,673
who, between the two
options of getting a degree and

1359
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:25,936
going around the world on
a boat, would say to his kid,

1360
01:31:26,231 --> 01:31:27,721
“get a degree!”

1361
01:31:28,024 --> 01:31:31,232
No, he would have said, “get
the boat and travel the world.”

1362
01:31:31,528 --> 01:31:37,148
A couple of unforgettable times, he
would just come out of the blue and say,

1363
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:41,614
“listen, I have an idea.

1364
01:31:41,913 --> 01:31:46,623
I'll buy a boat, and you're going to set
off around the mediterranean islands."

1365
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,830
And I would reply, “dad,
I don't know how to sail.

1366
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:53,088
Why should I go around
the mediterranean islands?”

1367
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:58,594
Or, “did you know there are people
selling boats in polynesia?"

1368
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:03,006
And I'd say, “dad, why
should I go to polynesia?"

1369
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:06,051
"I want a tobacco shop on my doorstep!”

1370
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,066
Stop.

1371
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,293
Lucio fulci directed dozens
of films, starting from the

1372
01:32:52,317 --> 01:32:54,128
musicarelli, Italian musicals,
starring adriano celentano

1373
01:32:54,152 --> 01:32:57,131
and Mina, and the cycle-comedies and
sketch-comedies, starring Franco and ciccio.

1374
01:32:57,155 --> 01:33:00,235
In 1969, he debuted in the thriller genre,
proving the unique style and vision

1375
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:03,488
that he would ultimately show in his
revolutionary and shocking horror movies.

1376
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:06,570
From the second half of the 80s,
he only shot very low-budget films,

1377
01:33:06,873 --> 01:33:09,660
which progressively estranged him
from the filmmaking he deserved.

1378
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:12,541
He died in 1996 at 69 years old,
after 5 years away from a set,

1379
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:14,997
and just when he was about to
make his comeback with an

1380
01:33:15,256 --> 01:33:17,588
important film, the wax
mask, produced by Dario argento.

1381
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:22,674
Today he is one of the most
loved film directors worldwide.
