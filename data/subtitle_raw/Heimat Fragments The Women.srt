1
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,895
Do you want to hear my prognoses
for the next century?

2
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,495
Clocks will disappear
little by little,

3
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,419
as no one will be interested 
in punctuality any more.

4
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:22,779
In architecture right angles 
will be abolished,

5
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,213
because we will learn to let 
buildings grow like plants.

6
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,809
Men will become women.

7
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,537
And women will be men.

8
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,411
Simply humans.

9
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,176
And enjoy the freedom of choice and 
learn to do everything at the same time.

10
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,612
And Aids will be curable.

11
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,051
Will you marry Delveau?

12
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,296
As the woman at his side 
I could accomplish anything.

13
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,452
No money troubles.

14
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,259
Lukas would go to the 
best French schools.

15
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:03,934
That gave me the most to think about.

16
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,860
And Delveau had something which I liked.

17
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,292
I don't find him unsexy,
but I threw all that away.

18
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,412
I am totally crazy, huh?

19
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:21,051
Every time I thought of saying 
'yes', it saddened me.

20
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,132
You don't love him, that's all.

21
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,809
I begin the new millenium without 
work, without plans,

22
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,171
without money, without security.

23
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,059
They say that one day your 
gaze turns backwards.

24
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,575
Your youth ends on this day.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,173
But what was that, youth?

26
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,009
Was it the present or the future?
Only the future?

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,256
And the joyful present.

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,648
Had they instilled our youth into us

29
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:07,575
like a language or good manners?
'You who are young, to you belongs the world.'

30
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,331
But then, who do they belong to? Us?
The world? Us?

31
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,612
Before everything else, I 
belonged to it, to the young.

32
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:23,418
To the helpless children of the '68 
generation, to whom everything was permitted.

33
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,773
we, who from our fathers had the 
choice to change anything,

34
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,130
but nothing to grab hold of.

35
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,138
It's a miracle.

36
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,969
And then this view of myself, 
as I return from my friends

37
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,413
As I hug my child and before the window 
at once the future ceases.

38
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,936
Behind me 
the gifted child.

39
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,136
And in front of me, outside, in the light, 
the new day, the new century

40
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,610
that is just beginning before my eyes,
the past.

41
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:29,490
The present looms like the top of an iceberg
on the sea of the past.

42
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,688
I have yesterday' eyes,
yesterday's hands.

43
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:37,613
My foolish sorrow is from yesterday.

44
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,295
Perhaps I am not yet born?

45
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,770
Logical, as before I was born, 
everything was past.

46
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:44,291
 Perhaps then the present...

47
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:53,217
 perhaps then the present
once again arrives.

48
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,976
Where there is a place to build, 
there begins life.

49
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,734
My architecture professor always said,

50
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,490
You need your tools,
your discipline,

51
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,899
a good plan,
Happiness follows behind.

52
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,617
The houses that we build,
will outlive us.

53
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,377
They are there so that one day 
we will be carried out.

54
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,129
Feet first, as they say in Hunsrück.

55
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,776
But our shadows remain.

56
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,775
All those who live in a house 
stay as shadows in the walls.

57
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,449
The shadows of the dead 
are not in the graveyard.

58
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,250
Only we are there.

59
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,652
Sad,
that the gap gets ever wider.

60
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,498
Klara.

61
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,455
You can touch me anywhere,
but not on the forehead.

62
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,536
That makes me cry.

63
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,011
I don't know why that is.

64
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,411
But it is so.

65
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,533
Then I am scared that 
she looks at me.

66
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,656
I find it exactly so.

67
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:31,136
In the school the teacher 
is suddenly far away.

68
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,054
He opens and closes his mouth, 
but no sound comes out.

69
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,615
So it was for me today in maths.

70
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,495
The soul doesn't recognise time.

71
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,578
It is our bodies which become older.

72
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:52,619
Time plays itself out in our bones.

73
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,294
In our faces. In our breathing.

74
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,057
From this we know what time is.

75
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:03,452
And that it washes us away, every day.

76
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,651
Paul, there you are! 
We have been so worried.

77
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,736
How do you look?

78
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:53,260
We heard from the police
that you died at Boppard.

79
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,620
Child, you have a fever.

80
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,656
His head is very warm.

81
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,536
I knew it,
I knew it.

82
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,569
You didn't sleep at all last night.

83
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,178
Your face was white.

84
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,734
And you came out with such 
impossible things.

85
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,530
Like Eduard would have come out with.
The featherbrain.

86
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,137
- Good Afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

87
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:47,539
- I want to see how Paul is.
- He's over there.

88
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,218
Good evening, Paul.

89
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,168
In a couple of days, 
everything is back to normal.

90
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,452
Then will you come by 
and build that radio?

91
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,856
Not only the old lie in the ground,

92
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:51,178
who have throw away their lives,
as a tree throws away its autumn leaves.

93
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,739
No,
age itself also lies there.

94
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,697
The skin.

95
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:00,855
How often has my form died back to renew itself.

96
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,215
Hans.

97
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,900
Not on the rubble, 
that would break it.

98
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,329
Let him fly like in the spring instead.

99
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:10,452
- Yes mother, So when are we going?
- Now.

100
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,898
If the weight of the cells I 
have shed from my skin

101
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,932
weighs three or 
four times my weight,

102
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,095
How much would my lost thoughts weigh?

103
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:26,419
Then I came past and the road was ready.

104
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,697
In a year cars with hundreds 
of things were driving past.

105
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:37,493
How much does the first glance 
from the eye of a girl

106
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,696
who will one day become a woman?

107
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,377
How often must one molt 
before one can fly?

108
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,331
How much time is passed?

109
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,850
Little brother, little sister.

110
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,939
Martha, are you crying?

111
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,377
No.

112
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,296
Yes you are.

113
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,894
No, Hermann, I'm not crying.

114
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,131
You're mistaken.

115
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,174
Of course you're crying. 
Why this time?

116
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,211
Oh, Hermann.

117
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,820
I've been waiting so terribly long for you.

118
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,492
And waiting.

119
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,456
Do you know what that is, Herman?
To wait?

120
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,132
Yes.

121
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,056
In heaven, they speak the 
Hunsrück dialect.

122
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:17,456
How could it be otherwise when 
there are so many Simons up there.

123
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,572
Aunt Lucie, here. Come!

124
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,219
But, Lucie!

125
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,939
What are you up to then?

126
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,930
It's good that you came, Maria.

127
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,660
It was time that we talked.

128
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,057
But not here.

129
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,170
- Lucie.
- Why not?

130
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,893
I want to talk about death.
One can do that in any place.

131
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,051
In the fullness from the void.

132
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,651
In the essence from the appearance.

133
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:13,131
From the falshood to the truth.
from the darkness to the light.

134
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,810
from death into light.

135
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:19,732
From the the world into heeaven.

136
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,851
Amen.

137
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,974
Each of us is manifold.

138
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,052
In so far as each of us has lost many dreams.

139
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,330
With every dream we lose a body.

140
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,899
Hello Ernst.

141
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,491
- Hello.
- Good day.

142
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,615
- Ernst, wonderful that you have come already.
- Hello mother.

143
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,736
Come on, up now.

144
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,414
Don't trouble yourself with it.

145
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,852
The brute would have only brought you work, 
and would have brought nothing in.

146
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,694
I wouldn't have brought anything more in either.

147
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,450
I asked myself often how memory worked.

148
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,416
Remembrance keeps only fragments and leftovers

149
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,536
which don't want to make a whole.

150
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,580
To remember, that means 
to dig for fossils.

151
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,773
The true histories lie 
deep under the earth.

152
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,371
Yeas, it's good.

153
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,370
Martha, I thought 
mother was dead straight away.

154
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,252
Yes.

155
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,129
So, I think, 
we have to call the police.

156
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,454
The dog had found a scent.

157
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,733
When the dog smells something,
it is no longer led astray.

158
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,250
The dog behaves strangely,
there must be somthing there.

159
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,610
Do you mean, the woman could lie there?

160
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,531
Look at what I've found.

161
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,577
That looks like a prehistoric snail.

162
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,816
It is at least 100,000 years old.

163
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,097
Neither of us was here,
but this snail was here already.

164
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,573
That isn't a snail.
It looks more like a May beetle.

165
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,894
When I look all around here,
this was all sea.

166
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,615
'Greetings from Migenne.

167
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,136
I wanted to visit my old friend Apollonia, 
but she is not longer alive,

168
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,490
only little Gretel, her daughter.

169
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,375
I am well accommodated, and am coming back 
to Schabbach on 07.10.1975.

170
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,413
Come and pick me up from the tour 
bus in Kirchberg at 1.15 PM, mother.

171
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,017
I am bringing Gretel with me.''

172
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,379
Anton.

173
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,815
We're here.

174
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,769
I was worried that Gretel wouldn't 
enjoy staying with us.

175
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,495
But she is enchanted with Hunsrück.
This is my Anton.

176
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,851
- Bonjour Monsieur.
- This is Martha. - Bonjour Madame.

177
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,533
You must know at last 
where you come from.

178
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,971
Stop, Martha.
I can do what I want.

179
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,054
I am finally an adult.

180
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,134
You are my dainty Visavis.

181
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,978
That's what Otto always says to me.

182
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,613
Piece by piece
I must carefully excavate the rubble.

183
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,411
by remembering.

184
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,337
From the disordered fragments, 
I put something together anew.

185
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,617
Remembering is a labour.

186
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,173
We build ourselves a landscape in our minds.

187
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,490
A second house in the clouds.

188
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,938
And hope that it is more durable than the first,

189
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,576
which turns to dust 
on the ground below.

190
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,489
Look at the sky, 
do you see it?

191
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,099
That would be great.

192
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,253
For me, it's not going well.
It's going badly now.

193
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,128
You could hear the fair until now.

194
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,971
- You've got a beautiful belly button.
- You've got a beautiful belly button too.

195
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,135
That is the gateway of life.

196
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,933
- Back then everything chopped and changed.
- Back then?

197
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,970
Before. At that time.

198
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,377
For once there are no more time-tables.

199
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,898
Time and logic 
have ceased to rule us.

200
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,738
That makes me happy.

201
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,537
Myself again.

202
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,895
Goodbye, Hermann.

203
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,853
Hermann, what makes you run so?

204
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,488
- Good day, Aunt Lucie.
- He neither sees nor hears.

205
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,169
- Good day, Uncle Eduard.
- Help us with the cases.

206
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,490
- Edu, go on, but be careful.
- Okay.

207
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,535
Go on! We're going to the 
holy rock. At Trier.

208
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,817
- Do we need to stay over, Lucie?
- Well, if we need to.

209
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,376
It should work miracles,
it's like Lourdes.

210
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,849
Not by the window, Eduard, 
there's a draught.

211
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,612
Hermann.

212
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,219
- Have you come from school?
- Yes.

213
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,177
- How was it?
- Same as always.

214
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,413
You're in the sixth form now.
The techer has to say 'Sie' now.

215
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,498
Hermann, if only my 
little Horst were still alive.

216
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:48,418
He got an 'A' in maths 
just before he died.

217
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,775
- Yes, it's all haywire.
- Hermann, come.

218
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,618
I have to go. Goodbye.

219
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,739
- Do you know how Horst died?
- Yes, Aunt Lucie.

220
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,489
- I have to go.
- Hermann.

221
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,012
He was your age.

222
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,978
How he found the land mine 
in the woods.

223
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,973
Oh well, my child, it's okay.

224
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,248
- My greetings to your mother.
- Okay.

225
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,418
Much simply stays as it is.

226
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,178
Always the same.

227
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,769
Only spiders settle down.

228
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,091
When I hit the anvil,
it breaks the stiffness.

229
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,415
Don't worry, it's only 
briefly disturbed here.

230
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,498
Everything stays dead.

231
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,692
Nothing will be alive again.

232
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,375
only briefly a little noise.

233
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:21,016
When I strike the anvil, 
I summon ghosts.

234
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,131
The ghosts of all those who have known 
the sound of the anvil since childhood.

235
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,458
From the distance.

236
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,332
From the confusion of wars.

237
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,098
The armourers.

238
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,777
May I take the coat with me?

239
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,289
That my mother, when she 
was my age, was older.

240
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,609
And that my grand mother, 
when she was the same age

241
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:06,131
was even older ...
and when my great grandmother died,

242
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:10,418
she heard the same noise of the 
anvil that my grandmother heard.

243
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:16,774
and they collected all of them around 
them and had nothing more to say.

244
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:35,532
Men and animals appear to 
live on different planets,

245
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,219
and yet, when they are 
afraid, seem the same.

246
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,497
Ernst!

247
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,019
Ernst!

248
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,336
Ernst!

249
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,735
Ernst, where is it safer, 
in the North or the South?

250
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:17,859
In the North, Hermann.
Definitely in the North.

251
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,491
Christine, do you know these things here?

252
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,736
These are 'Arschkratzele'.

253
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,015
'Arschkratzele'?

254
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,895
That my father changed his face, 
when he could change it.

255
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,937
That he wa somethines older, 
sometimes younger in his life,

256
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,939
when he was in love, 
or changed his location.

257
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:53,453
Or, when he remembered, 
or turned around.

258
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,450
One gets one's name from the house, 
not the father, in Hunsrück.

259
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,530
Whoever came from the Simon-house, was a Simon, 
regardless of who the father was.

260
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,889
and when the men went forth,

261
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,574
drawn into the war, or were unfaithful,

262
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,412
the house remained.

263
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,337
The house of many mothers.

264
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,248
Hermann, look here.
I have to show you something.

265
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,337
Look here.
This is the Simon-Journal.

266
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,978
We are more than 1,500 families.

267
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,337
- 1,500.
- All called Simon.

268
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:48,699
Do you not want to go in?
The soup is very good.

269
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,773
Glasisch ... look around now.

270
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,458
So many people.

271
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,015
They all came to honour Maria.

272
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,648
How was I to know that?

273
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,018
Glasisch, see those behind?

274
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,011
The foreigners.

275
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,614
Those are the relatives from Brazil.

276
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,779
They have come from America 
and Paderborn.

277
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,495
- From Hamburg.
- Those are Martha's relatives.

278
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:21,540
- Where do your children study?
- ln Berlin, in Paris and in Mainz.

279
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,938
And they all came because of Maria.

280
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,374
- As if she was our mother.
- But she was as well!

281
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,057
Paul!

282
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,618
Glasisch.

283
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,290
- Now I want to know at last.
- What do you want to know?

284
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:56,653
What was it with that dead, naked 
woman in the woods, in 1927?

285
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,260
Time doesn't heal every wound.

286
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:13,337
when all those who have done monstrous 
things to one another are dead,

287
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,977
when they are all under the ground,

288
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:19,731
Then the mark of 
the monstrous remains.

289
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:24,890
like the water mark,
which always returns.

290
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,289
A broken waterpipe is unlikely.

291
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:33,492
There are no water pipes in Schabbach.

292
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,254
Yes.
It must come from underground.

293
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,780
Tastes like spring water.

294
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,774
Is that really Schabbach water?

295
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,816
Herr Simon,
Thank God that you're here.

296
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,329
We were waiting for you.

297
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,249
A miracle has happened.

298
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,972
- What do you mean?
- A miracle.

299
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,979
Whoever has stayed their whole 
life in Schabbach,

300
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,614
doesn't believe in miracles and ghosts.

301
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,219
That is because one knows and recognises 
everything which one has faith in.

302
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,251
and what he doesn't.

303
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,810
Causes and effects are always 
clear in the heimat.

304
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,334
Only the one who leaves, 
who rips out his roots

305
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,655
the seeker, brooder und stormer of heavens,

306
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:02,136
the fearless enlightener 
of all secrets,

307
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,490
they must beware of ghosts.

308
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:09,815
We won't let our Schabbach 
become a circus!

309
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:13,499
'Our Schabbach',
I don't think I heard right.

310
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,648
We won't let ourselves be concreted over! 
That would be the absolute end.

311
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,012
What time is it?

312
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:35,857
It's half one, Rudi.
Go back to sleep.

313
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,894
I'll say to the doorman,
Now I'm through.

314
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,618
- What are they doing at this time in the office?
- I don't know.

315
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,689
- Udo Trötsch?
- This is for you.

316
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:55,616
- Abolish the national anthem of the DDR?
- No.

317
00:37:56,100 --> 00:38:00,332
You didn't come any more in the week,
so we won't count on you any more.

318
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,610
- Frau Wurz.
- You must know that.

319
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,891
That is our final word,
Herr Trötsch.

320
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,329
The business must finally continue.

321
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,817
- Notice of offences from the party training course. 
- Take it away.

322
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:20,338
Honour, pride, heroism,
all ideals and utopias,

323
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,930
in which they believed in for 100 years,
went awry.

324
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,695
Everything, in which men believed,

325
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:30,091
changed into tobacco smoke 
and the smell of bars.

326
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,293
Each has become his own memorial.

327
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:57,978
stands lost in the landscape, and asks 
himself how the world would look without him.

328
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,051
When belief goes away,
there is nothing more to save.

329
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,296
NVA electrical equipment for various
purposes, power, and aircraft equipment.

330
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,297
munitions cases.

331
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,174
transportation cases for aricraft parts.

332
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,979
Around 450 engines for the T-55 tank.

333
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,056
Tyres for armoured 
personnel carriers.

334
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,619
Gearboxes from T-55s.

335
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:42,129
Robur-LKWs
with various beam constructions

336
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,649
and water treatment plants.

337
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,816
Tank tracks for the T-54.

338
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:19,819
Little Zweibel jumped through the fields
and said: 'The world is round.'

339
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,698
Grandmother had always said 
that when I wanted to run on.

340
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,737
From the heimat, 
behind the red flashes of lightning.

341
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:40,219
There come clouds,

342
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:47,009
But father and mother 
are long dead,

343
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,459
No one knows me there any more.

344
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,972
How soon, how soon, 
will the quiet time come.

345
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,578
When I too shall rest.

346
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:10,337
When I too shall rest.

347
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:16,776
There near me rustles the beautiful

348
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,175
Forest's loneliness.

349
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:29,610
The beautiful forest's loneliness.

350
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:36,176
And no one here shall know me anymore.

351
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:43,653
And no one here shall know me anymore.

352
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,411
Wasn't that Peter?

353
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,135
A classmate.
We played music together.

354
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,568
Nothing is alien here.
I am alien.

355
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,933
Once I almost drowned in an inn 
near here. There below.

356
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,058
I was seven.

357
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,331
But the green water 
spat me out again.

358
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,498
My mother warmed me 
endlessly in her arms.

359
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,170
Endlessly in her arms.

360
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:24,696
I never come back any 
more to Wasserburg.

361
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,248
I have never understood 
why we reproduce.

362
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,899
It would have never come into question 
had I never had a child.

363
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,896
Now the story goes on,

364
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,057
without me having anything 
to offer Lukas.

365
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,136
But how was it with the others?

366
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:19,771
with Ernst, who hoarded his 
underground treasure for those to come,

367
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,977
who never were.

368
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,169
They all believed that the 
future was something manageable.

369
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,092
Even the childless.

370
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:45,971
- Good evening.
- Christian Ballsegel, Maitre de Cuisine.

371
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,258
- Good evening.
- Henri Delveau, Maitre d'Architecture.

372
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,417
I have a surprise for you.

373
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,735
- A recommendation?
- No.

374
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,011
I thought you lived in Wiesbaden?

375
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,608
My beauty studio is still there.

376
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,295
Only now I'm back in Hunsrück.
I always find my happiness here.

377
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:14,371
It must be in my stars.

378
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,213
We have a full house again,

379
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:21,219
but I hope it suits your French guest.

380
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,211
Good evening.

381
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:32,338
Lulu,
I'm the happiest woman in the world.

382
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,774
You could guess, and you're 
the first I've told.

383
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,931
We're getting married in October.

384
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,499
Yes.

385
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,329
And then ...
Wait, I'll show you the pictures.

386
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,138
Here.

387
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,376
The pictures of Saint Petersburg.

388
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:12,779
We're opening a restaurant there.

389
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:18,094
Christian has a good enough 
reputation to always stay employed.

390
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,258
A restaurant of the highest class, 
that one respects,

391
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,611
every cook dreams of that. 
Naturally I do too.

392
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,851
Is it near to the opera?

393
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,252
You know that? Do you know that 
I grew up in Saint Petersburg?

394
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,018
Here, do you see?

395
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,892
Gold leaf on the roof.

396
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,818
In Brezhnev's time,

397
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:40,495
When the tourists came 
for the olympic games.

398
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,136
I heard that Russia was hard up 
because of corruption and the mafia.

399
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,498
You know, when we have a place 
like that in that situation,

400
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:53,408
then we'll manage everything else.
You're only young once.

401
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:59,014
Especially as a woman.
True, Lulu?

402
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,974
Often I wake up and have the feeling 
that everything has already happened.

403
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,650
The houses are all built,

404
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:11,090
The business all taken care of.

405
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,655
The couples have all coupled, and

406
00:46:13,820 --> 00:46:17,893
the trees and the grass grew
and the children are grown up.

407
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,860
Only I lie heavy in my unfulfilled 
hopes and am no longer needed.

408
00:46:38,620 --> 00:46:40,417
Shit.

409
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,888
I thought it would outlive me.

410
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,292
But that it reckoned on 
leave its ghost here.

411
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,331
Cable fire.

412
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,617
You can forget it.

413
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,852
Such a fuck up!

414
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,979
So, brother heart.

415
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,689
Now I am curious when 
you last drunk.

416
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,813
Still a little cold.

417
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:16,499
But we have time.

418
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,692
That is something fine.

419
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,294
A '61 Château Lafite Rothschild.

420
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,219
I have 10 bottles of 
that in the cellar.

421
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,410
''Una bottiglia del destino''

422
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:36,252
What?

423
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,056
l have to think about 1961.

424
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,931
'61.

425
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,779
They built the Berlin wall then.

426
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,009
I was in Munich, 
second semester.

427
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,492
My God,
I had no idea then.

428
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,135
As the young genius that I was.

429
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,175
It doesn't matter, gone is gone, 
the past is the past.

430
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:07,456
We were totally convinced 
that it depended on us.

431
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:09,619
For all eternity.

432
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:16,138
The fathers, disempowered, brought 
the whole mess down on us.

433
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,052
Never military again.

434
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,531
An end to Americanism, capitalism.

435
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,136
The fantasy of power.

436
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:32,658
Freedom for love.
Life for music.

437
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:37,413
- I never feel at home.
- But you have your family.

438
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:43,491
- You call that heap of garbage family.
- A daughter, a grandchild ...

439
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,811
Wife ...
Honoured in all concert halls.

440
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,698
Your work.

441
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,417
What does all that add up to?

442
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,057
Listen to me,

443
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,056
We have known death since 
we came into the world.

444
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:02,973
But the slow traceless vanishing,

445
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:07,493
after years, no longer 
seeming successful, that is new.

446
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:10,569
That is the new horror of the '90s.

447
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,972
One lives second hand.

448
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,649
This is my vault.
Everything is hermetically sealed.

449
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,176
The first part of my life ended 
on this underground walk.

450
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,690
When the ancient water course 
was one day breached,

451
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,209
and here under everything the treasures,

452
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:35,015
which Ernst brought together 
through his whole life, drowned.

453
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,098
I saw myself at this time as 
guardian of the family treasures.

454
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,736
Finally no longer disconnected.

455
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,936
No more running away from connections.

456
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,768
No longer needing to 
clarify who I was.

457
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,133
A whole for ever.

458
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:02,498
Then the water came.

459
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,931
I saved my child,
my reputation, my building site.

460
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,808
I struggled with and lost the future.

461
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,735
The old future of childhood.

462
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,576
Where is the Frauenkirche,
Herr Ludwig? Wasn't that it, just now?

463
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,573
- That was the German museum.
- You're winding me up.

464
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:37,774
Because I'm new to Munich.
You've just started too.

465
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:42,809
If I could find out from 
where I originated,

466
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:45,408
then I would perhaps have an answer.

467
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,619
I perhaps knew where this journey led.

468
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,098
But obviously, it was just chance 
that Hermann was my father,

469
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:58,256
That my mother, from Hunruck, 
ran into him in Munich.

470
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,857
Up to that point, she had simply 
nothing to do with his life.

471
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,132
Normally, we get out in front of the 
Opera house, but obviously not today.

472
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:10,093
Because of the opening this evening.
You see it?

473
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,171
Everything locked up.

474
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,728
Have you ever been in, Herr Ludwig?

475
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,531
What does an opera ticket cost?

476
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:26,290
They cost at least 100 Marks 
for a standing ticket.

477
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,418
Why should I want to go in there.

478
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,770
I thought I could enjoy it.

479
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,418
to be beautifully dressed,

480
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,530
chic little bag
and a little perfume from Dior.

481
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,252
and naturally opera glasses,

482
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:53,259
With that I could look the 
singer right in the throat!

483
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:59,689
Nauturally, I would have to 
be in charming company.

484
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,409
A gentleman, who would translate the text for me.

485
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:06,057
They always sing in 
Italian or old German.

486
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,935
So I would like to understand it as well.

487
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,335
Above all the plot.

488
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,975
Shall I tell you what the 
opera has to do with me?

489
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,896
Nothing, Absolutely nothing.

490
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,133
Or almost nothing.

491
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,691
I once played the tombola to 
raise money for the reconstruction,

492
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,648
I won a bicycle for the fortune of 50 pfennigs.

493
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:36,293
Now the opera house is ready. 
One can hardly believe it.

494
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,340
For once, the times have interchanged.

495
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:43,453
I am once again a '68 child, 
who must play with the adults.

496
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:46,777
To enjoy all freedoms, to fight 
until one can fight no more.

497
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:51,456
To run around nacked, to shit on the 
floor, to run away when it gets boring.

498
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,697
The friends of my parents 
will be my family.

499
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,972
Where is Munich, 
I asked my mother.

500
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,696
lI was perhaps four years old.

501
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,215
'Here, you are in Munich.'

502
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:20,049
She's quite savvy after all 
her years as a tour guide.

503
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,933
But my child's view 
couldn't see Munich.

504
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:27,093
I couldn't see the borders. Munich 
was all around. It was the world.

505
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,129
Would you like a coffee?

506
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:38,818
Hello.

507
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:40,817
Two coffees.

508
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,090
- It's over!
- What is over?

509
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:59,088
You'll never see me again.

510
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,449
I'm leaving you all.
I'm leaving Munich.

511
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,492
And where to you want to go to?

512
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:13,576
To Africa.

513
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,736
City of my childhood.

514
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,177
When I consider things properly,
I wasn't really there.

515
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:22,450
I wasn't there, in my childhood.

516
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,531
I was only a part of the scenery.

517
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:28,175
I had breathed the air, and felt 
the shadows of my agitated parents

518
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,813
as they scampered by.

519
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,699
Always looking for something which 
they themselves didn't even know.

520
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,495
Is he a nigger?
I mean, is he black?

521
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,452
He is a doctor.

522
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:43,372
And he has seen more of the world

523
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,775
than all of us put together.

524
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:48,694
And what are your plans with him?

525
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,891
To marry him.

526
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,253
Marry?

527
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,378
Helga, you're crazy.

528
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:00,532
What does marriage have 
to do with love or Africa?

529
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,537
For me, a lot.

530
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,811
I don't want any discussion about concepts.

531
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:13,378
I want to take 
leave of your life.

532
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,290
What do that mean for my life?

533
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,212
You were never in it.

534
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,338
We are friends. We have written 
poetry together, songs.

535
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,650
- We've kissed.
- and embraced.

536
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,975
And that's normal, or not?

537
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:32,099
Helga ...
you are smitten, or, in love.

538
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:38,851
I pity this doctor of 
yours already.

539
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,972
Is that him in the photo?

540
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,690
He could be your father.

541
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,977
He wants to have a child with me.

542
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:15,928
Helga, I thought you 
wanted to be a lyricist.

543
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,972
Or to write novels.
You wanted to live your own life.

544
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,137
You want to throw all that 
away for a little love?

545
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,579
Helga, I'll tell you what.

546
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,493
Love ... is only in art.

547
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,573
It is only an idea.

548
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,450
And something more.

549
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:46,820
When you exchange life and art for each 
other, that is the most brutal kitsch.

550
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,170
- I'm sorry, we're finished now.
- I only want some information.

551
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:39,739
- Goodbye, have a nice weekend.
- I have a short question.

552
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,290
That you could perhaps answer as you leave.

553
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:45,576
Come again on Monday morning.

554
00:59:45,740 --> 00:59:49,289
No, that's much too late. I want 
to know how fast one can marry.

555
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,769
Is there some sort of lightning wedding?

556
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:55,455
When it's a matter of life and 
death, we have some special rules.

557
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:59,533
We can apply them if the bridegroom is 
close to death. Is he close to death?

558
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:02,772
- No.
- And can he walk?

559
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,577
Yes, he can walk.

560
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,210
- Have you ordered a summons?
- No, do I need to?

561
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:12,417
As a rule, and when he can walk, yes.

562
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,614
We want to emigrate to South-West Africa.

563
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:19,455
- When?
- By plane on the 1st December.

564
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:22,134
1st December?
Let me look...

565
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,892
December, December ...

566
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:27,730
- Do you not want to marry in South Africa?
- ln South Cameroon?

567
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:29,618
- For example.
- No.

568
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:33,856
- You want to get married in church?
- Yes.

569
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,098
That makes it hard.
That makes it hard.

570
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:39,969
What are they down there?
Muslims?

571
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:42,091
Hamites, Bantus.

572
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,410
Sudanese with priest-kings.

573
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:47,017
Is that admissible in Germany?

574
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:53,292
I can only give you advice
from the EGBGB Article 11 paragraph one.

575
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,692
When this, shall we say, priest-king

576
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:00,739
is authorised by local tribal law ...

577
01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:06,210
this tribal law will be recognised 
by the appropriate government entities,

578
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:11,051
when the priest during the marriage 
ceremony issues

579
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:16,216
a certificate, or certificate equivalent....

580
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,574
But that would be very tough in the bush.

581
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:25,172
When they come with fetishes around their 
necks or rings through their noses ...

582
01:01:25,700 --> 01:01:28,533
So, in principle, fine, but never 
before tried in practice.

583
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,612
By airline pilot it's even 
more problematic, I believe.

584
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:41,737
Something else. The German consulate.
What's the capital down there?

585
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,736
- l think it's Douala.
- I don't know it.

586
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,652
Is it big?

587
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,692
It rains a lot down there.

588
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,889
Over 10,000 Millimeters a year.

589
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,578
- Twenty times as much as in Munich.
- And you want to go there?

590
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,848
I've never been to the 
music conservatory.

591
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,378
My mother must have prevented it.

592
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,813
There were even places, 
from which nothing good came.

593
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:17,772
A thousand assumptions, unseen precipices.

594
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:24,056
Mothers can plant their bitterness 
in the souls of their daughters.

595
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:28,660
The music and the other women.

596
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,932
Both had the same smell for my mother.

597
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:42,259
And my mother had instilled that 
sense of smell in me, and that disgust.

598
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:48,778
The bad smell of the Munich years 
flowed out of the musical instruments.

599
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:20,737
Volker.

600
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:24,730
Can you clarify this for me?
what is this note?

601
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:28,370
Hello, Clarissa,
I've been looking for you all day.

602
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:34,094
You can't publish that 
I'm doing a concert with you!

603
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:38,048
- Let's talk it over, Clarissa.
- We've already done that.

604
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,576
- You never said, no.
- I never said, yes, either.

605
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,850
Volker, I'm a cellist.

606
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:47,613
I'm not going to 
play the fool for you.

607
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:50,095
Take care, I'll explain it for you.

608
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,693
Behind you, two drums,

609
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:58,090
Piano, flute, double-bass.

610
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:02,649
And then you with your cello 
in the middle of the stage.

611
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:06,449
- Floodlit by spotlights.
- And I don't play a note.

612
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:10,570
Volker, for that reason, 
you could get anyone.

613
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,498
For that I don't need 
11 years training.

614
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:16,572
Clarissa, I'm not asking anything indecent.

615
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,335
I don't want you to undress, 
or make obscene gestures.

616
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:23,338
I just want this theatrical moment.

617
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,012
And what do you say to that?

618
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:29,772
- I don't know.
- Will you do it?

619
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,135
I've not been here that long.

620
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,453
Volker, I'm going now.

621
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,896
I will come to your concert,

622
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:42,569
but I'll sit below, in the stalls.

623
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:46,136
and I won't be your little 
mascott, on the stage.

624
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,616
Goodbye.

625
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:58,010
Hello, Lukas! It's your mother.

626
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,855
I'm in a house of 1,000 smells.
Do you want to hear?

627
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:07,008
I thought that as you are a little 
musician, you could smell with your ears.

628
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,969
- That is Clarissa.
- Lichtblau.

629
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:18,737
- What blue?
- Lichtblau (light blue).

630
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,408
Lichtblau.
A very poetic name.

631
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,214
In Spanish: 'Celeste'

632
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,775
In Italian, 'Azzurro Chiaro'

633
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,375
In English, 'Lightblue'

634
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:32,612
- Okay.
- Greek: 'Phosphompleanos.'

635
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:36,736
- Chinese: 'Tanla-ü'
- 'Tanla-ü'

636
01:05:39,380 --> 01:05:41,894
In Dutch: ''Lichtblau''

637
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:43,738
I see.

638
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,289
I admire him very much.
A polyglot.

639
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:49,538
He can speak 11 languages
with recorder.

640
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,932
May I try to?

641
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,457
'The art of speech.'

642
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,698
What do you need that for?

643
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,811
- I would like to ...
- He attends an acting school.

644
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,529
- He wants to lose his accent.
- Exactly.

645
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,379
- Accant?
- I would like to study that too.

646
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,538
A shame.

647
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,449
I find your accent so pleasant.

648
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,572
- May I?
- Yes.

649
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:39,812
Aha, look, your famous ''ch''.

650
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:54,816
- l didn't understand anything.
- Me neither.

651
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,811
How come?

652
01:07:44,580 --> 01:07:49,370
Don't disturb yourself, I'll come to you.

653
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,410
- Good day.
- Herr Simon.

654
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,095
- Ah.
- He's doing the entrance examination. Composition.

655
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,818
- Is that by you?
- Yes.

656
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:01,972
I see that's a wonderful instrumentation.

657
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:04,375
What is it for?

658
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,089
It is for orchestra,
piano accompaniment und choir.

659
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:13,296
- Where do you come from, Herr Simon?
- I come from Hunsrück, Rheinland.

660
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,770
- Where is that?
- In the Northwest.

661
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,898
- Is it a beautiful landscape?
- I find it so, yes.

662
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,973
- Mountains and beautiful valleys?
- Yes.

663
01:08:24,140 --> 01:08:27,530
I am a great nature lover.

664
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:32,694
But unfortunately, my life is a martyrdom.
I am in New York today, Tokyo tomorrow.

665
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:37,496
The day after tomorrow Donaueschingen
today Munich, you see.

666
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,699
Pardon me, Herr Simon.
Could you play these two measures for me?

667
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,414
- Maybe three, but sing as well.
- yes.

668
01:08:44,540 --> 01:08:47,100
Do it as you would play it.

669
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:52,613
tighten, young ones, master,
and build high the middle ship.

670
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,732
Wonderful. Beautiful. Beautiful, Herr Simon.
Congratualtions, Herr Simon.

671
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,817
Truly a very beautiful piece.
Goodbye then. Many thanks.

672
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:05,333
Goodbye.

673
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,377
Adieu.

674
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,454
One of our vice-presidents.

675
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,692
Life or art.

676
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,295
An eternal tale of woe.

677
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:26,692
I must have felt that as a child.
I refused to learn an instrument.

678
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,858
Before everything for women, 
art stands in the way of life.

679
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:41,179
 I'm used to going mad,

680
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:46,614
It guides every path to their ends.

681
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:53,579
Our joys, our sorrows,

682
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:59,339
All a play of lights!

683
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:05,689
Have you spoken with Evelyn already?

684
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,809
About what?

685
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,495
Do you want to talk to me about Clarissa?

686
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:19,250
You are her best friend.

687
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:24,691
I was with her in Coburg, in Nürnberg,

688
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,699
in Augsburg, in Regensburg,

689
01:10:27,940 --> 01:10:31,410
in Memmingen, ... in Neu-Ulm.

690
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,058
The whole odyssey.

691
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:46,090
 ln the mountain stream's dry channel

692
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:53,331
I quietly wound my way down,

693
01:10:53,860 --> 01:11:00,891
Every stream wants to reach the sea,

694
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:07,818
Every suffering also its grave.

695
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,251
What should I do with it?

696
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:01,376
Nothing.
Simply look.

697
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:05,493
The madness is loosed
on this world.

698
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,420
I always saw a godsend in him.

699
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:12,050
Not for all, but for us, 
the young generation.

700
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:16,525
Who knows what happens now.

701
01:12:18,927 --> 01:12:21,043
For the time being, everything is quiet.

702
01:12:23,287 --> 01:12:24,720
Deathly still.

703
01:13:20,247 --> 01:13:21,965
Greetings.

704
01:13:22,407 --> 01:13:24,762
come on Evelyne, are we going up.

705
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:32,527
Herr Distle, I'll be right back.

706
01:13:40,927 --> 01:13:43,395
Evelyne, now you can eat until you're full.

707
01:13:43,527 --> 01:13:45,404
There's roast pork.

708
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,005
Evelyne, are you coming?

709
01:14:07,087 --> 01:14:08,486
So Evelyne,

710
01:14:08,607 --> 01:14:12,885
I've always known,
that you would come home one day.

711
01:15:21,047 --> 01:15:23,880
- What are you doing, Evelyne?
- l'm going back.

712
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:28,115
- What have we done to you?
- You've done nothing to me.

713
01:15:30,127 --> 01:15:32,004
I wanted to see you once more.

714
01:15:57,967 --> 01:15:59,320
Evelyne ...

715
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:01,763
Stay a little longer.

716
01:16:02,207 --> 01:16:04,118
At least for a few days.

717
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:09,681
You don't know what you want.

718
01:16:10,487 --> 01:16:13,126
You're at the end of your nerves.

719
01:16:15,447 --> 01:16:20,123
- Jürgen, can you lend me a little money?
- We don't have any money.

720
01:16:24,927 --> 01:16:28,715
- How much do you need?
- 500.

721
01:16:30,407 --> 01:16:32,125
I know, it's a lot.

722
01:16:32,447 --> 01:16:34,597
But I need it.

723
01:16:44,407 --> 01:16:49,083
Mum, I'm going down with Evelyn 
to take the money from the till.

724
01:16:49,247 --> 01:16:50,999
I've done it already.

725
01:16:54,687 --> 01:16:57,042
Sometime I'll tell you everything.

726
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:01,559
Evelyne.

727
01:17:28,127 --> 01:17:32,006
I belong to a generation 
of happy childhoods.

728
01:17:32,127 --> 01:17:34,402
They wanted to keep
all hardships, all injustice

729
01:17:34,527 --> 01:17:37,837
all existenial struggles away from me.

730
01:17:38,007 --> 01:17:40,999
My clever, enlightened unfaithful parents.

731
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:43,796
But life ...

732
01:17:54,607 --> 01:17:57,360
I'll write down the address.

733
01:17:57,527 --> 01:17:59,722
It is Rue André del Sarte.

734
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:03,837
Near Montmartre.

735
01:18:05,487 --> 01:18:09,639
When you get in, it is to the 
left of the gas tap.

736
01:18:09,927 --> 01:18:12,725
Please don't use the chimney, 
as it's walled up.

737
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:15,447
- I won't.
- And there's fresh milk in the fridge.

738
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:18,718
- Can you speak French?
- Yes, from school.

739
01:18:19,407 --> 01:18:22,956
Good, then you'll get 
to know people quickly.

740
01:18:28,767 --> 01:18:30,405
This is Boni.

741
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:33,282
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour, ça va?

742
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:34,800
Oui.

743
01:18:36,647 --> 01:18:41,880
- We have to go now.
- Okay, have fun in England.

744
01:18:42,047 --> 01:18:44,038
See you again in Munich.

745
01:18:46,007 --> 01:18:47,599
- See you.
- Okay.

746
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:52,963
Don't ask if you may do what you like, 
but if you can.

747
01:19:53,607 --> 01:19:58,681
A stupid expression of my father
that shows to the child that it doesn't belong.

748
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:03,158
Therefore I was happy 
when he left me and my mother.

749
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:07,517
He should tramp around 
with his musician friends instead.

750
01:20:07,687 --> 01:20:11,521
I told myself that 
I wasn't descended from him.

751
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:16,396
What did all this Schwabing 
chaos have to do with me?

752
01:20:45,807 --> 01:20:48,321
I tried again to 
construct images.

753
01:21:03,487 --> 01:21:06,445
Tomorrow's Süddeutsche.

754
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:09,925
I give more regard to 
natural necessity.

755
01:21:10,087 --> 01:21:12,726
Now I have a ravenous hunger, for instance.

756
01:21:12,887 --> 01:21:15,765
After, the sense stands higher than you.

757
01:21:15,927 --> 01:21:17,963
Here we could eat Linsen soup.

758
01:21:18,087 --> 01:21:22,126
Then we fart in a Nitroglycerine
cellar, which makes a good combination.

759
01:21:22,527 --> 01:21:23,596
Hey.

760
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:34,527
Hey, such a crazy woman. 
Do you know her?

761
01:21:34,687 --> 01:21:38,999
Yes, she is a stage... stage...
stage school student. shit!

762
01:21:40,127 --> 01:21:43,199
Introduce me to her.
The night is yet young.

763
01:21:45,127 --> 01:21:48,483
Good evening. l ... l ...

764
01:21:48,647 --> 01:21:52,925
- I'd rather you said nothing.
- May proletarians sit here?

765
01:21:53,927 --> 01:21:56,600
- Are you an actress?
- Has he said something?

766
01:21:56,887 --> 01:22:00,004
- Have I said something?
- Have I smelled something.

767
01:22:00,607 --> 01:22:04,759
I see in you already 
dishonesty in those eyes.

768
01:22:07,327 --> 01:22:09,966
So she is a natural actress.

769
01:22:11,167 --> 01:22:12,964
You are a gruesome pest.

770
01:22:14,167 --> 01:22:18,046
- And who are you?
- Shall I put you on the silver screen?

771
01:22:18,207 --> 01:22:20,880
My best friends are in short films.

772
01:22:21,047 --> 01:22:24,323
Short film?
Surely you mean Tesafilm (sellotape).

773
01:22:24,567 --> 01:22:28,526
Hermann, would you confirm what 
I have said to the young lady.

774
01:22:28,647 --> 01:22:30,842
You old cynic, sit down.

775
01:22:31,007 --> 01:22:34,443
You definitely come from such a farmer's village.
Just learnt German.

776
01:22:34,567 --> 01:22:37,798
Have you heard how 
well she pronounces Tesafilm?

777
01:22:37,927 --> 01:22:41,158
And you?
Where was your nursery?

778
01:22:44,527 --> 01:22:48,486
I've cut myself free.
My father was an old Nazi from Rosenheim,

779
01:22:48,647 --> 01:22:53,357
his hands covered with Jewish blood.
My mother was his slave, day and night.

780
01:22:53,527 --> 01:22:55,404
They both gross me out.

781
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:58,240
Above all when I imagine 
how they conceived me.

782
01:22:58,367 --> 01:23:01,837
Can you imagine your 
mother fucking?

783
01:23:02,007 --> 01:23:07,206
- There are still also beautiful things in the world.
- Today art is just destruction.

784
01:23:07,367 --> 01:23:09,676
Everything must be shattered, 
everything atomised.

785
01:23:09,807 --> 01:23:12,275
I heard a concert the other day.
Ice cold.

786
01:23:12,967 --> 01:23:14,878
I believe in progress.

787
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:17,799
Since the moon landing

788
01:23:18,287 --> 01:23:21,677
millions people have seen the earth from 
the perspective of the universe.

789
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,363
The thought makes me crazy.

790
01:23:24,767 --> 01:23:30,046
The beautiful and the reasonable 
are one and the same.

791
01:23:30,207 --> 01:23:34,405
Like goulash soup.
nice and reasonable.

792
01:23:35,127 --> 01:23:38,722
- You disgust me.
- l imagine so, you are still a young woman.

793
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,679
- See you tomorrow.
- The day after tomorrow.

794
01:23:49,847 --> 01:23:55,240
I wish I had a beautiful, practical, 
nordic housewife.

795
01:23:55,567 --> 01:24:00,357
- What singular experience.
- I should have paid more attention.

796
01:24:01,087 --> 01:24:05,922
- Want to bet that you dream of me?
- Hopefully not a nightmare.

797
01:24:12,287 --> 01:24:16,599
She shook hands with you and not me,
because you were blase with her.

798
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:20,965
I'm not interested any more 
in the lives of women.

799
01:24:21,087 --> 01:24:25,126
She saw that.
Because of that, you looked 
better than me.

800
01:24:26,007 --> 01:24:28,521
But something about you is a 
puzzle to her.

801
01:24:29,047 --> 01:24:32,198
Me too ...
To me, I mean.

802
01:24:33,487 --> 01:24:35,557
Do you want to live forever?

803
01:24:36,047 --> 01:24:37,924
Not you?

804
01:24:47,327 --> 01:24:50,239
I'm sorry.
I love you.

805
01:25:08,527 --> 01:25:11,166
Your music is truly wonderful.

806
01:25:11,287 --> 01:25:16,884
- Thankyou. - But why 
this rhapsodic element?

807
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:21,157
What do you mean by that?
Because I write melodies?

808
01:25:21,767 --> 01:25:24,235
- Someone once said:
- Excuse me.

809
01:25:24,367 --> 01:25:28,599
'Whoever writes melodies 
betrays the working classes'

810
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:31,476
What do you think of that?

811
01:25:40,727 --> 01:25:43,161
'What man sees in the stars,

812
01:25:43,327 --> 01:25:45,761
woman knows how to 
use in the saucepan'

813
01:25:45,887 --> 01:25:48,117
- What do you mean by that?
- Hebbel.

814
01:25:48,287 --> 01:25:50,243
That pleases me too.

815
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:52,485
Hermann.

816
01:25:52,607 --> 01:25:54,245
Thank you.

817
01:25:54,407 --> 01:25:57,843
This evening is a 
wonderful thing, no?

818
01:25:57,967 --> 01:25:59,719
The cello.

819
01:26:00,367 --> 01:26:02,244
You!

820
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:08,919
That moved me a great deal.
I was totally mystified.

821
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:11,358
Ach, Juan.

822
01:26:14,527 --> 01:26:17,439
- Are you coming to mine?
- Are you still coming to mine?

823
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:19,603
- Good evening, Renate.
- Hello, Hermann.

824
01:26:19,727 --> 01:26:22,321
That was a successful evening.

825
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:26,957
I've never cried so much at a concert.

826
01:26:27,087 --> 01:26:30,477
- Good.
- We're going for something 
to eat. See you later.

827
01:26:31,287 --> 01:26:34,085
- See you.
- 'til then.

828
01:26:36,487 --> 01:26:38,603
I've seen through you, Hermann.

829
01:26:40,727 --> 01:26:45,243
Your piece'Sine nobilitate'
is about a sex change.

830
01:26:45,847 --> 01:26:47,485
That's new to me.

831
01:26:47,607 --> 01:26:51,077
Four men and one absent woman, 
so it seemed.

832
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:56,241
But I kown better. It was four 
women and one absent man.

833
01:26:59,407 --> 01:27:01,557
The piece betrays you, Hermann.

834
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,435
Did you enjoy it or not?

835
01:27:11,087 --> 01:27:12,725
Elisabeth.

836
01:27:14,167 --> 01:27:18,240
I'm staying with Hermann.
It's getting late, perhaps very late.

837
01:27:19,847 --> 01:27:22,759
Then you'll meet him 
some other time.

838
01:28:13,607 --> 01:28:15,484
I have to cry.

839
01:28:17,407 --> 01:28:19,682
It's so beautiful.

840
01:28:21,007 --> 01:28:24,204
And we're going to the cinema later.

841
01:28:26,447 --> 01:28:28,403
No, Hermann ...

842
01:28:28,927 --> 01:28:32,886
That a single day 
can be so beautiful...

843
01:28:43,167 --> 01:28:46,477
Fathers remain our secret heroes.

844
01:28:47,567 --> 01:28:50,525
From my mother, 
I got a sense for the real.

845
01:28:50,687 --> 01:28:53,599
From my father,
a sense for the possible.

846
01:28:56,527 --> 01:29:01,317
I can go into my mirror image.

847
01:29:04,767 --> 01:29:06,723
I can pull the spade ...

848
01:29:09,167 --> 01:29:11,840
... from the water still dry.

849
01:29:23,047 --> 01:29:28,644
I can hear the voices of 
happy guests beneath each step,

850
01:29:29,087 --> 01:29:31,442
who have danced here many times.

851
01:29:32,207 --> 01:29:36,917
In the sun-drenched, daylight 
garden of my father, everything is possible.

852
01:29:49,887 --> 01:29:52,526
Time can develop fissures.

853
01:29:55,127 --> 01:29:59,279
Past and present collapse into one another.

854
01:30:03,207 --> 01:30:08,361
And under the gravel, 
the buried treasures become visible.

855
01:30:16,607 --> 01:30:19,679
I am the archeologist of the future.

856
01:30:20,767 --> 01:30:22,803
And dig up the present.

857
01:30:27,047 --> 01:30:28,958
Ah.

858
01:30:32,207 --> 01:30:35,119
It's going well.

859
01:30:46,527 --> 01:30:50,964
I could never forget you,
Waltraud.

860
01:30:55,527 --> 01:30:57,677
I should have been a musician.

861
01:30:58,967 --> 01:31:01,003
Did you say something?

862
01:31:01,927 --> 01:31:04,646
I should have studied music.

863
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:08,961
- Instead of philosophy?
- Fräulein Cerphal, that's right.

864
01:31:16,327 --> 01:31:19,399
I've somehow lost 20 years, father.

865
01:32:13,967 --> 01:32:18,245
Sadly the house shall become 
a living pyramid.

866
01:32:18,407 --> 01:32:21,524
Fräulein Cerphal,
those are historic places,

867
01:32:21,687 --> 01:32:24,485
which cannot be touched in any circumstances.

868
01:32:24,607 --> 01:32:28,395
Historic places ...
I had this hope once.

869
01:32:28,567 --> 01:32:30,523
And I did much in return.

870
01:32:30,687 --> 01:32:33,201
But in between I had great doubts.

871
01:32:33,367 --> 01:32:38,361
Do you believe that something 
happened here of historic importance?

872
01:32:43,047 --> 01:32:45,607
I was conceived here too.

873
01:32:45,887 --> 01:32:50,324
They have both told me that.
The realist and the dreamer.

874
01:32:51,007 --> 01:32:56,764
But like all historical events, 
this one too is shrouded in mist.

875
01:33:03,607 --> 01:33:06,565
- Are you happy?
- About your child?

876
01:33:08,927 --> 01:33:12,602
In my mind I can't understand that 
I had something to do with it.

877
01:33:13,647 --> 01:33:15,763
But you did.

878
01:33:17,727 --> 01:33:22,118
- A miracle.
- Yes, Hermann. A miracle.

879
01:33:38,887 --> 01:33:41,242
Smile please. Good.

880
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:43,159
Look out, friends!

881
01:33:45,007 --> 01:33:48,044
- come on, get off.
- A small packet ...

882
01:33:53,647 --> 01:33:55,638
- An outing?
- Au!

883
01:33:57,047 --> 01:34:00,005
- I'm innocent.
- You have the burden of proof.

884
01:34:00,167 --> 01:34:02,442
- l'll prove it to you.
- Ach.

885
01:34:03,327 --> 01:34:05,841
- Hello.
- Objection!

886
01:34:17,287 --> 01:34:22,520
- Now I'll give it some gas!
- Great, granny, give it some gas!

887
01:34:22,687 --> 01:34:25,997
l'm going as fast as I can,
Jacqueline.

888
01:34:26,167 --> 01:34:29,637
Pauline, do you think we'll 
find the right street?

889
01:34:30,487 --> 01:34:35,038
- Munich Schwabing, is that right?
- Yes, granny, we have to get off there.

890
01:34:38,087 --> 01:34:42,365
That's a heavy case.
That's not just silk blouses.

891
01:34:42,647 --> 01:34:44,603
And watch out.

892
01:34:45,007 --> 01:34:47,760
No scratches, please.

893
01:34:49,407 --> 01:34:51,716
1943.

894
01:34:52,527 --> 01:34:55,963
When the councillor was 60,

895
01:34:56,887 --> 01:34:58,843
I was also 13.

896
01:34:59,247 --> 01:35:03,638
One wouldn't believe it.
That time exists no longer.

897
01:35:07,207 --> 01:35:08,959
Look here.

898
01:35:10,047 --> 01:35:11,799
Wilhelm Cerphal.

899
01:35:12,247 --> 01:35:14,363
That's what he was called, the councillor.

900
01:35:14,887 --> 01:35:18,482
And from that we still have all 32 pieces.

901
01:35:19,287 --> 01:35:22,996
Don't drop any, 
the strawberries must arrive whole.

902
01:35:27,927 --> 01:35:31,283
Please,
leave your things in the library.

903
01:35:32,887 --> 01:35:35,606
How nice and ceremonial!

904
01:35:35,887 --> 01:35:38,640
Look, Jacquelinsche,
so many books.

905
01:35:38,767 --> 01:35:41,759
A very elegant house, Frau Ries.

906
01:35:41,927 --> 01:35:45,715
Please but your things by the table.

907
01:35:55,887 --> 01:35:58,799
Good ...
Under the picture ...

908
01:35:59,847 --> 01:36:02,407
Is that really Meissner?

909
01:36:02,647 --> 01:36:04,000
Yes.

910
01:36:04,887 --> 01:36:07,401
We only have Nymphenburger at home.

911
01:36:07,567 --> 01:36:11,196
I have a Meissner bowl as well.

912
01:36:11,367 --> 01:36:16,043
- How beautiful.
- But this leaves me speechless.

913
01:36:16,647 --> 01:36:18,638
That must be my envy.

914
01:36:19,127 --> 01:36:21,925
We could never afford that.

915
01:36:22,567 --> 01:36:26,685
I can hardle wait to meet,
Frau Cellophan.

916
01:36:26,847 --> 01:36:28,246
- Cerphal.
- That's right.

917
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:33,157
Are you not scared the young 
people might break something?

918
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:38,321
I'm having so much fun cooking 
something nice again.

919
01:36:38,647 --> 01:36:40,603
- You cook as well?
- Yes.

920
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:43,406
Could I give you a hand with that?

921
01:36:43,527 --> 01:36:46,280
I feel better when 
I've got something to do.

922
01:36:46,447 --> 01:36:49,484
Pauline, you can understand that?

923
01:36:49,687 --> 01:36:52,247
Most of all I would like to 
look at the whole house.

924
01:36:57,647 --> 01:37:00,605
Houses have a childhood,

925
01:37:01,007 --> 01:37:04,886
an adolescence and the 
golden years of maturity.

926
01:37:06,247 --> 01:37:11,241
Then later, the smell of old age 
comes up from the foundations.

927
01:37:12,487 --> 01:37:15,763
New paint on the walls no longer helps.

928
01:37:15,887 --> 01:37:19,197
The house will no longer 
display its elegance.

929
01:37:24,167 --> 01:37:26,522
- Hello, Schirmer.
- Please.

930
01:37:26,687 --> 01:37:30,157
That is Jacquelinsche.
Good day, I'm Kröber.

931
01:37:30,287 --> 01:37:33,757
I've never seen such a beautiful house.

932
01:37:33,927 --> 01:37:35,838
And so nicely decorated today.

933
01:37:36,007 --> 01:37:38,077
Pauline!

934
01:37:38,527 --> 01:37:42,520
- Have you brought in the silk blouses?
- Yes, they're in the library.

935
01:37:42,647 --> 01:37:44,399
Where?

936
01:37:44,727 --> 01:37:46,558
Oh, yes.

937
01:37:47,327 --> 01:37:49,841
Our students should 
have it good for once too.

938
01:37:49,967 --> 01:37:52,561
And see how we used to live.

939
01:37:54,047 --> 01:37:58,006
I'm cooking you a great,
13 course menu.

940
01:37:58,167 --> 01:38:02,206
What, 13 courses?
Such a thing doesn't exist.

941
01:38:02,687 --> 01:38:06,475
- What are you cooking there?
- This is my kingdom.

942
01:38:10,487 --> 01:38:12,239
I want to go home.

943
01:38:12,527 --> 01:38:16,725
Jacquelinsche, but you've enjoyed the big city.

944
01:38:18,767 --> 01:38:23,477
Ach, child. I understand.
It's the same with me.

945
01:38:24,127 --> 01:38:25,879
I want to go home too.

946
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:34,639
Genuine pure silk.

947
01:39:22,167 --> 01:39:29,642
And the accordian's playing 
a farewell dance for us.

948
01:39:30,927 --> 01:39:38,845
Come and dance our 
Tango d'amor with me.

949
01:39:39,487 --> 01:39:47,360
I am in love like never before.

950
01:39:48,167 --> 01:39:56,165
Every hour with you was wonderful.

951
01:39:57,887 --> 01:40:00,401
What they had found here, 
and made me,

952
01:40:00,527 --> 01:40:04,156
was Hunsrück.
Once again Hunsrück.

953
01:40:05,407 --> 01:40:10,083
I'm made up of two ends, 
cut from the same material.

954
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:15,359
One end swings like the 
indian rope trick, above,

955
01:40:15,527 --> 01:40:21,363
and wants to conquer the air, the other 
writhes on the ground, seeking a firm footing.

956
01:40:34,407 --> 01:40:36,159
Half past seven.

957
01:40:40,447 --> 01:40:42,483
Yes. Yes.

958
01:41:41,247 --> 01:41:43,841
I won't get the bread in this weather.

959
01:41:43,967 --> 01:41:45,923
The butter's rock hard.

960
01:41:46,047 --> 01:41:50,040
But your wife has wrapped 
it up so warm, Herr Ludwig.

961
01:41:50,887 --> 01:41:54,436
There's a time for sewing 
and a time for reaping.

962
01:41:54,607 --> 01:41:57,599
That is an old proverb 
of my mother's.

963
01:41:59,007 --> 01:42:01,726
No one else is coming today 
because of the bad weather.

964
01:42:02,887 --> 01:42:06,482
Shall we go to Hertie in the 
canteen to drink some Glühwein?

965
01:42:06,607 --> 01:42:10,395
But Herr Ludwig,
no alcohol when you're driving.

966
01:42:11,007 --> 01:42:12,759
We can have soup.

967
01:42:13,607 --> 01:42:15,086
Glühwein soup?

968
01:42:19,087 --> 01:42:23,080
For some reason my wife doesn't 
like it when I eat here.

969
01:42:23,247 --> 01:42:25,397
I don't understand that.

970
01:42:26,087 --> 01:42:28,521
We met each other here.

971
01:42:28,687 --> 01:42:31,645
She worked next door in Hertie shipping,

972
01:42:32,487 --> 01:42:35,001
And I called myself a 'colleague'.

973
01:42:35,327 --> 01:42:36,965
- Hello.
- Yes?

974
01:42:37,407 --> 01:42:39,398
One moment, stay there.

975
01:42:40,047 --> 01:42:41,878
- Fräulein,
- Yes?

976
01:42:42,287 --> 01:42:44,847
one moment, do you belong to the house?

977
01:42:45,007 --> 01:42:46,963
Wel yes, you know ... l ...

978
01:42:48,767 --> 01:42:53,079
It's okay, apologies.
She's from the perfume department.

979
01:42:53,207 --> 01:42:57,166
- So you're from the house?
- Naturally. That settles it. Thanks.

980
01:42:57,327 --> 01:43:00,717
- Perfume department, I, Yes, Perfume department.
- Then that's fine.

981
01:43:00,887 --> 01:43:02,957
- Thank you.
- Come with us.

982
01:43:04,767 --> 01:43:07,600
- Herr Ludwig. My friend Olga.
- Müller.

983
01:43:07,767 --> 01:43:10,042
Herr Ludwig.
Hello, and thank you.

984
01:43:11,007 --> 01:43:13,237
Thank God it went well again.

985
01:43:13,367 --> 01:43:16,723
- Take off that jacket, it's so flashy.
- Sure.

986
01:43:17,887 --> 01:43:21,721
Come on ... You get the meal vouchers 
in front of the entrance.

987
01:43:24,447 --> 01:43:27,280
How did I do that,
Herr Ludwig?

988
01:43:27,567 --> 01:43:31,799
- You don't eat anything.
- A picture of a girl's room.

989
01:43:31,967 --> 01:43:35,403
- It's a fact!
- She is an actress.

990
01:43:35,967 --> 01:43:37,320
Oh.

991
01:43:38,567 --> 01:43:41,127
That's why I thought we knew each other.

992
01:44:01,487 --> 01:44:04,047
I haven't had a hot meal in 2 days.

993
01:44:04,167 --> 01:44:06,920
Do I know you from a film, 
or pictures?

994
01:44:07,807 --> 01:44:10,162
You look insanely familiar.

995
01:44:11,207 --> 01:44:13,163
Let me think about it ...

996
01:44:14,367 --> 01:44:18,280
- From television.
- I'd rather you didn't remember me from that.

997
01:44:18,807 --> 01:44:21,446
No! It was last week.

998
01:44:21,927 --> 01:44:25,363
But help me.
It was an Edgar Wallace crime story.

999
01:44:26,847 --> 01:44:31,443
- I hope you didn't watch that.
- I swear it, I saw you.

1000
01:44:31,607 --> 01:44:35,156
- Are you on television?
- It's embarrassing.

1001
01:44:35,327 --> 01:44:37,761
Why embarrassing? Tell me.

1002
01:44:37,927 --> 01:44:41,363
What should one do,
when your friend's don't see you.

1003
01:44:41,487 --> 01:44:44,638
I'm surrounded by young film makers, 
but none of them offer me a role.

1004
01:44:44,767 --> 01:44:46,917
Have you been on television?
1069
The woman with the ovarian cyst.

1005
01:44:54,407 --> 01:44:56,159
What?

1006
01:44:56,767 --> 01:44:58,723
Ovarian cyst?

1007
01:44:58,847 --> 01:45:03,637
Right, it's come back to me now.
on that recent health program.

1008
01:45:04,087 --> 01:45:07,284
How you played the fear 
before the operation!

1009
01:45:07,487 --> 01:45:08,602
Magnificent!

1010
01:45:08,727 --> 01:45:13,642
I said to my wife:
'Do they use real sick people?'

1011
01:45:14,087 --> 01:45:15,520
It was so real.

1012
01:45:15,847 --> 01:45:18,566
Do we have to keep on talking about it?

1013
01:45:19,367 --> 01:45:23,758
- Was it so badly recounted?
- How you played fear!

1014
01:45:23,927 --> 01:45:28,443
During the diagnosis, did you 
really believe it would be cancer?

1015
01:45:28,607 --> 01:45:32,520
- I'm glad that you liked it.
- Really good, I must say.

1016
01:45:32,647 --> 01:45:35,559
No difference from real life.

1017
01:45:35,727 --> 01:45:39,766
And then the tears.
How do you do that with the crying?

1018
01:45:40,167 --> 01:45:44,365
You cried so bitterly when 
your friend visited you.

1019
01:45:45,167 --> 01:45:46,725
Were the tears real?

1020
01:45:47,127 --> 01:45:51,040
- There are certain means.
- So there are means.

1021
01:45:52,207 --> 01:45:56,837
Do you use onions?
I cry when something is sour.

1022
01:45:57,727 --> 01:46:00,764
Do you know, at the 
chief's birthday party,

1023
01:46:00,887 --> 01:46:03,765
the wine,
it was pure sorrel.

1024
01:46:04,967 --> 01:46:09,245
But Fräulein Olga,
you're a genuine actress.

1025
01:46:10,967 --> 01:46:12,685
You know, Fräulein Olga,

1026
01:46:12,847 --> 01:46:17,284
I'm mighty proud that I could 
ask you all these questions.

1027
01:46:20,567 --> 01:46:25,960
I think we should leave 
Fräulein Müller to eat in peace now.

1028
01:47:59,407 --> 01:48:04,162
So ... arrived.
You don't see anything.

1029
01:48:05,207 --> 01:48:07,163
Lulu, what then?

1030
01:48:12,687 --> 01:48:15,440
In the stony ears of bears,

1031
01:48:15,607 --> 01:48:18,440
one can tell one's most secret wishes.

1032
01:48:19,007 --> 01:48:21,567
They are not guaranteed to be fulfilled.

1033
01:48:21,687 --> 01:48:24,804
But they remain secrets, 
that's how it goes.

1034
01:49:40,527 --> 01:49:46,238
You must finally understand
that we cut what you've shot.

1035
01:49:47,247 --> 01:49:51,160
That is what the public will 
see and feel.

1036
01:49:52,727 --> 01:49:54,285
And what do we see?

1037
01:49:56,447 --> 01:49:59,723
Below the greenery and above 
a grey sky, nothing else.

1038
01:49:59,847 --> 01:50:03,840
A really banal picture, by the way.
It tells me little.

1039
01:50:05,207 --> 01:50:09,485
Your Don Gusto and the 
tropical nights were of little use.

1040
01:50:10,087 --> 01:50:14,524
That's clear in your head,
but not in the film.

1041
01:50:20,887 --> 01:50:24,118
well, was that arranged differently?

1042
01:50:24,327 --> 01:50:27,125
But Reinhard,
I captured the clocks wonderfully.

1043
01:50:27,247 --> 01:50:29,602
That was a fantastic approach.

1044
01:50:30,847 --> 01:50:33,281
Yes, fine, but it wasn't mine ...

1045
01:50:33,607 --> 01:50:35,882
Go ...
and stop.

1046
01:50:36,607 --> 01:50:38,837
Okay ... now piano.

1047
01:50:40,087 --> 01:50:44,126
piano now ...
and stop.

1048
01:50:44,367 --> 01:50:46,517
- Okay, work that out, please.
- Hm.

1049
01:50:46,687 --> 01:50:48,598
Rob, Reinhard.

1050
01:50:48,767 --> 01:50:54,239
I've been thinking that we 
should cut this scene in two.

1051
01:50:55,087 --> 01:50:57,840
A closeup of a closeup.
Look sharp!

1052
01:50:57,967 --> 01:51:02,836
- Ulla, have you worked it out?
- We'll save 70 to 80 seconds that way.

1053
01:51:04,687 --> 01:51:08,919
We were all agreed that the 
scene wasn't realistic.

1054
01:51:09,087 --> 01:51:12,682
Those are dream images, 
and there are no cuts in dreams.

1055
01:51:12,847 --> 01:51:17,477
What do you mean, no cuts?
I always dream with cuts.

1056
01:51:19,087 --> 01:51:23,717
I can't verify that.
My opinion is that that's false.

1057
01:51:24,927 --> 01:51:27,805
Think about it,
try to remember.

1058
01:51:29,767 --> 01:51:34,557
I think Reinhard is right.
I often dream, but there are no cuts.

1059
01:51:34,847 --> 01:51:39,398
Also, no closeups,
when I'm honest. Sorry, Stefan.

1060
01:51:43,487 --> 01:51:45,637
Also, I have no sound in my dreams.

1061
01:51:46,727 --> 01:51:52,677
Normal music won't work, we need 
sharp violins or the music of the spheres.

1062
01:51:56,887 --> 01:51:58,639
Cries for help.

1063
01:51:59,207 --> 01:52:00,959
Or something like cries for help.

1064
01:52:02,007 --> 01:52:05,397
- A plant, which cries for help.
- Perhaps.

1065
01:52:07,687 --> 01:52:09,757
What did Reinhard say?

1066
01:52:10,367 --> 01:52:12,562
He left it up to me, or you.

1067
01:52:15,327 --> 01:52:18,125
Can I see the scene again?

1068
01:52:19,687 --> 01:52:22,759
I've got the feeling that he hates this film.

1069
01:52:22,927 --> 01:52:26,522
He hates it, and doesn't want to edit it.

1070
01:52:35,447 --> 01:52:37,324
What are you looking for here?

1071
01:52:38,487 --> 01:52:39,966
What?

1072
01:52:41,807 --> 01:52:43,684
The end of a story.

1073
01:52:43,887 --> 01:52:45,639
That's simpler.

1074
01:52:45,847 --> 01:52:47,883
Cerphal.

1075
01:52:48,007 --> 01:52:49,838
Collapse! (Zerfall)

1076
01:52:50,647 --> 01:52:55,562
- Do you understand?
- I had imagined it differently.

1077
01:52:57,727 --> 01:52:59,319
That is evening light.

1078
01:52:59,487 --> 01:53:01,398
That is a broken up piece.

1079
01:53:02,407 --> 01:53:04,079
picturesque ruin.

1080
01:53:05,967 --> 01:53:07,559
Downfall in pink.

1081
01:53:12,807 --> 01:53:14,604
Beautiful death.

1082
01:53:15,847 --> 01:53:19,317
But in reality it doesn't die beautifully.

1083
01:53:24,527 --> 01:53:27,564
- Glass eye.
- It looks so benign.

1084
01:53:30,047 --> 01:53:31,605
I hate cameras.

1085
01:53:35,127 --> 01:53:37,516
One should always seek out the hideous.

1086
01:53:38,407 --> 01:53:40,045
Horribly difficult.

1087
01:53:41,687 --> 01:53:43,245
Simple impressions.

1088
01:53:44,367 --> 01:53:47,677
without hate, without disgust. Ice cold.

1089
01:53:53,447 --> 01:53:55,915
That'll often bring them to tears.

1090
01:53:56,887 --> 01:54:00,357
Then the work is done for the day.

1091
01:54:06,767 --> 01:54:09,042
Is there hideousness (haesslich) 
without hate (hass)?

1092
01:54:19,087 --> 01:54:21,203
Does the word come from hate?

1093
01:54:21,887 --> 01:54:26,358
- I've never thought about it.
- Typically German, that word.

1094
01:54:29,887 --> 01:54:33,562
- beauty lies.
- Brutto, laid, ugly ...

1095
01:54:35,167 --> 01:54:36,964
Language falsifies everything.

1096
01:54:38,367 --> 01:54:43,680
- Is that why you take photographs?
- I've never thought about it.

1097
01:54:47,647 --> 01:54:50,719
Yes, you're right.
That would make an exhibition.

1098
01:54:50,847 --> 01:54:53,077
If that's true, I'd want to.

1099
01:54:55,407 --> 01:54:58,797
- Thank you. 'Olga Müller'.
- Mullère. - Mullère.

1100
01:54:59,447 --> 01:55:02,644
She is the heroine, so to speak: Esther?

1101
01:55:03,647 --> 01:55:05,046
A beautiful name.

1102
01:55:06,567 --> 01:55:10,242
- Is it based on real life?
- It's more beautiful than real life.

1103
01:55:10,407 --> 01:55:11,999
Yes, certainly.

1104
01:55:12,167 --> 01:55:17,525
Must be, Cinema should be more 
beautiful than life, I always say.

1105
01:55:20,367 --> 01:55:22,642
I can hardly wait to read it.

1106
01:55:24,607 --> 01:55:28,964
The remaining copies will be 
picked up tomorrow and sent to Bonn.

1107
01:55:29,087 --> 01:55:32,443
They must be at the 
Home Office by Friday.

1108
01:55:33,447 --> 01:55:35,483
So. Take a look here.

1109
01:55:35,647 --> 01:55:37,603
Come here. Take a look.

1110
01:55:38,407 --> 01:55:40,159
In the corner ...

1111
01:55:40,927 --> 01:55:42,440
All screenplays.

1112
01:55:42,607 --> 01:55:46,156
I have to get them read for 
the screenplay awards.

1113
01:55:46,287 --> 01:55:48,118
Yes ...

1114
01:55:49,207 --> 01:55:52,916
They're all hoping for the grand prize.
Just like you.

1115
01:55:53,687 --> 01:55:56,281
What are we going to do, Reinhard,
if you don't get the prize?

1116
01:55:56,407 --> 01:55:59,843
No ...
We won't think about it now.

1117
01:56:02,927 --> 01:56:05,600
Those are Chinese nightingales.

1118
01:56:13,727 --> 01:56:16,799
From where does one 
understand one's own life?

1119
01:56:16,927 --> 01:56:18,963
Memory is only a part.

1120
01:56:19,167 --> 01:56:24,082
What hasn't it told us? 
The plans which have been forged. Everything!

1121
01:56:24,207 --> 01:56:28,439
Parents, their friends, playmates,
my own friends.

1122
01:56:28,927 --> 01:56:33,205
I am surrounded by dreams,
by projects, which will never be fulfilled.

1123
01:56:33,327 --> 01:56:37,400
From their beginnings great stories,
which trickle away into the quicksand of time.

1124
01:56:37,527 --> 01:56:39,802
Life is not a broad stream.

1125
01:56:39,927 --> 01:56:44,557
It is made up of thousands of beginnings.
Never tired, always discontent.

1126
01:57:17,287 --> 01:57:20,085
Would you like to 
come with me to the cinema?

1127
01:57:26,607 --> 01:57:30,316
My mother doesn't like me,

1128
01:57:30,487 --> 01:57:34,400
And no sweetheart do I have,

1129
01:57:34,807 --> 01:57:39,164
Oh why don't I die?

1130
01:57:39,367 --> 01:57:42,643
Oh why don't I die?

1131
01:57:42,807 --> 01:57:47,005
Why don't I die,

1132
01:57:47,167 --> 01:57:50,557
What am I doing here?

1133
01:57:51,327 --> 01:57:54,683
Yesterday there was a church fair,

1134
01:57:54,967 --> 01:57:58,516
But of course no one saw me,

1135
01:57:59,007 --> 01:58:03,080
For I am so unhappy

1136
01:58:03,527 --> 01:58:06,246
that I do not dance at all.

1137
01:58:07,007 --> 01:58:10,761
For I am so unhappy

1138
01:58:11,247 --> 01:58:15,001
that I do not dance at all.

1139
01:58:16,327 --> 01:58:19,444
Let them be, those three roses

1140
01:58:19,607 --> 01:58:23,202
that bloom near the little cross:

1141
01:58:23,567 --> 01:58:27,606
Were you acquainted with the little maiden

1142
01:58:27,767 --> 01:58:31,316
who lies under it?

1143
01:58:31,847 --> 01:58:35,283
Were you acquainted with the little maiden

1144
01:58:36,087 --> 01:58:40,365
who lies under it?

1145
01:58:51,687 --> 01:58:53,245
Thank you.

1146
01:58:54,247 --> 01:58:55,965
- Marianne.
- At the very front.

1147
01:58:56,127 --> 01:58:59,244
- The front gives you neck ache.
- Ach, rubbish.

1148
01:59:05,207 --> 01:59:08,756
I thought we'd be too late,
and now we're too early.

1149
01:59:08,927 --> 01:59:14,240
Helga, I've been thinking a lot about 
your reproach from yesterday afternoon.

1150
01:59:14,407 --> 01:59:16,637
It wasn't a reproach, Marianne.

1151
01:59:18,007 --> 01:59:22,398
I don't know either why I'm often 
so dissatisfied with my life.

1152
01:59:25,447 --> 01:59:29,804
But Westphal is the 
perfect picture of a man.

1153
01:59:30,727 --> 01:59:34,083
And a doctor,
that all Munich raves about.

1154
01:59:35,807 --> 01:59:37,718
Helga writes poetry.

1155
01:59:38,047 --> 01:59:41,164
You have to see how the 
patients make eyes at him.

1156
01:59:41,287 --> 01:59:43,198
and send presents.

1157
01:59:43,847 --> 01:59:47,760
My living room is often a flower shop.

1158
01:59:49,607 --> 01:59:51,882
What am I complaining about?

1159
01:59:52,927 --> 01:59:56,556
We're building a little house 
soon in Meerfelder Bruch.

1160
02:00:00,767 --> 02:00:05,079
When I hear that,
I get so homesick for Vienna.

1161
02:00:06,687 --> 02:00:08,439
Helga-Putzi.

1162
02:00:09,487 --> 02:00:10,840
Come.

1163
02:00:18,487 --> 02:00:20,762
And when I sit in the cinema ...

1164
02:00:21,007 --> 02:00:24,363
Sadly I can't show you
'Die Pariserinnen'.

1165
02:00:26,687 --> 02:00:29,884
because the projectionist has vanished,

1166
02:00:30,047 --> 02:00:33,483
Although there's no football on TV.

1167
02:00:33,647 --> 02:00:36,207
- It's a crying shame.

1168
02:00:36,367 --> 02:00:40,042
He's taken the key to the main 
switch with him, unfortunately,

1169
02:00:40,167 --> 02:00:42,397
otherwise I could run the projector.

1170
02:00:42,527 --> 02:00:44,722
- So what now?
- Let's go.

1171
02:00:44,887 --> 02:00:46,798
Something has already occurred to us.

1172
02:00:47,127 --> 02:00:49,322
I don't feel like it any more.

1173
02:00:50,007 --> 02:00:51,838
But come. Come.

1174
02:00:53,727 --> 02:00:55,365
Dreams in the cinema.

1175
02:00:56,287 --> 02:01:01,441
I don't dream of the film, 
the film dreams of me.

1176
02:01:05,367 --> 02:01:07,722
Where is myself?

1177
02:01:10,567 --> 02:01:12,922
Where am I ... Then?

1178
02:01:15,007 --> 02:01:17,919
- Dorli? - Yes?
- Entrust yourself quietly to me.

1179
02:01:18,087 --> 02:01:20,442
München is almost my Heimat,
I know everything here.

1180
02:01:20,567 --> 02:01:24,765
- I live above the square, up there.
- Ach, how cool.

1181
02:01:24,927 --> 02:01:27,157
Helga, I want to go out.
Shall we?

1182
02:01:27,287 --> 02:01:29,403
- In spite of the long journey?
- That doesn't matter.
1251
02Have you got a suggestion?
- We should discuss it.

1183
02:01:32,447 --> 02:01:36,042
Another problem - 
have you got any money?

1184
02:01:36,207 --> 02:01:39,199
- A little still.
- l'm flat broke.

1185
02:01:44,927 --> 02:01:47,919
- Fed up?
- Thoroughly!

1186
02:01:52,407 --> 02:01:56,241
I'll introduce you to my landlady, 
then we'll have no hassle.

1187
02:01:56,807 --> 02:01:58,923
- Frau Heimhauser?
- Helga?

1188
02:01:59,087 --> 02:02:02,875
- How is your room?
- nice and clean.

1189
02:02:24,207 --> 02:02:25,799
Frau Heimhauser.

1190
02:02:35,807 --> 02:02:38,037
Seems to be no one there.

1191
02:02:41,767 --> 02:02:43,485
- Helga?
- Hm?

1192
02:02:43,767 --> 02:02:46,235
Does the policeman sleep behind this door?

1193
02:02:46,367 --> 02:02:49,643
Sure.
That's the bedroom of both of them.

1194
02:02:50,967 --> 02:02:52,844
You can look through here.

1195
02:02:56,167 --> 02:02:59,557
- Hopefully, he doesn't take his 
pistol to be with him. - Rubbish.

1196
02:03:12,367 --> 02:03:14,085
You, Helga?

1197
02:03:15,607 --> 02:03:19,646
I'm imagining how we both 
sleep in this narrow bed.

1198
02:03:20,487 --> 02:03:26,164
The policeman is just a few 
centimeters away, behind this door.

1199
02:03:26,327 --> 02:03:27,680
Dorli ...

1200
02:03:28,607 --> 02:03:30,325
Wild horse.

1201
02:03:40,407 --> 02:03:41,920
Helga?

1202
02:03:45,647 --> 02:03:49,401
- Have you never had company?
- What do you mean?

1203
02:03:49,567 --> 02:03:51,205
Wild horses or what?

1204
02:03:51,367 --> 02:03:54,006
- Men, naturally.
- Oh, men.

1205
02:03:54,407 --> 02:03:55,999
- Yes, once.
- And?

1206
02:03:56,247 --> 02:03:58,886
Was nothing,
I sent him away again.

1207
02:03:59,367 --> 02:04:01,597
So, not because of the police?

1208
02:04:02,167 --> 02:04:05,079
No, not because of the police.

1209
02:04:07,767 --> 02:04:09,723
So, wait.

1210
02:04:10,727 --> 02:04:14,925
- Look, there's some space here.
- Is that another room?

1211
02:04:15,087 --> 02:04:19,126
- Yes, my walk-in wardrobe.
- Cool!

1212
02:04:27,487 --> 02:04:31,036
Something smells funny here.
Like a big city.

1213
02:04:32,527 --> 02:04:35,166
Helga, I'm so agitated.

1214
02:04:36,727 --> 02:04:40,845
Shall we put some cool clothes on?
Make ourselves beautiful?

1215
02:04:41,007 --> 02:04:44,124
My friend, don't worry about clothes.

1216
02:04:46,407 --> 02:04:48,045
I don't believe that.

1217
02:04:50,887 --> 02:04:54,880
Helga, do you always go around 
in thrown together clothes?

1218
02:04:55,047 --> 02:04:57,402
Ach, Dorli.
Come, there's cake.

1219
02:05:01,607 --> 02:05:05,486
Shall I show you the present I got?

1220
02:05:25,927 --> 02:05:27,565
Boah!

1221
02:05:27,767 --> 02:05:30,884
Walter from Düsseldorf 
got me them.

1222
02:05:31,047 --> 02:05:32,639
Sexy, yeah?

1223
02:05:33,207 --> 02:05:37,723
He said, a woman must always 
have a secret under her clothes.

1224
02:05:38,527 --> 02:05:41,439
Get a hold of that.
That's pure silk.

1225
02:05:45,607 --> 02:05:47,837
Helga, you must have something too.

1226
02:05:49,647 --> 02:05:53,242
You always have something like that on you?

1227
02:05:53,967 --> 02:05:55,764
You're nuder than nude.

1228
02:06:11,607 --> 02:06:13,359
- Dorli?
- Yes?

1229
02:06:16,727 --> 02:06:19,241
I think I'm in love.

1230
02:06:19,527 --> 02:06:21,006
Really?

1231
02:06:21,607 --> 02:06:25,805
I want to see him.
I'm curious. Is he coming too?

1232
02:06:25,967 --> 02:06:28,276
I don't know. l hope so.

1233
02:06:28,807 --> 02:06:30,877
What sort of person is he?

1234
02:06:31,047 --> 02:06:32,480
Hm.

1235
02:06:32,807 --> 02:06:35,162
- He's a musician.
- Aha.

1236
02:06:35,687 --> 02:06:37,359
And?

1237
02:06:37,967 --> 02:06:41,004
He set some of my poems to music.
They sounded good.

1238
02:06:41,327 --> 02:06:44,399
- Does he know that you love him?
- Ach, Dorli!

1239
02:06:44,927 --> 02:06:49,079
You must always think 
so horribly practically.

1240
02:06:50,447 --> 02:06:55,157
I always think, fantasy ...
is much greater than reality.

1241
02:06:55,967 --> 02:06:58,800
It's said,
the fathers are always in doubt.

1242
02:06:58,927 --> 02:07:02,636
It's different for me.
I am the woman with many mothers.

1243
02:07:02,807 --> 02:07:06,561
They have 100 Names and are 
always on the trail of happiness.

1244
02:07:07,527 --> 02:07:09,961
I always read them in secret as a child.

1245
02:07:10,087 --> 02:07:11,566
beautiful, no?

1246
02:07:13,127 --> 02:07:15,277
So, sleep well now, Hermann.

1247
02:07:15,647 --> 02:07:20,243
Early tomorrow I'll wake you 
with a little buttered bread.

1248
02:07:27,927 --> 02:07:29,758
You suit me, Dorli.

1249
02:07:36,007 --> 02:07:38,521
Good night.

1250
02:07:44,127 --> 02:07:45,640
Good night.

1251
02:08:05,487 --> 02:08:08,843
I recently saw a black singer in Dortmund.

1252
02:08:09,127 --> 02:08:11,436
I have perhaps dreamt of him.

1253
02:08:12,007 --> 02:08:16,205
Of his rangy, sweat soaked body.

1254
02:08:16,367 --> 02:08:20,326
It was no longer a body, it was a landscape.

1255
02:08:20,487 --> 02:08:23,638
He had looked at me with red, evasive eyes.

1256
02:08:23,807 --> 02:08:27,004
Like an animal.
I sat in the front row.

1257
02:08:27,847 --> 02:08:30,236
Those are little girls dreams, Dorli.

1258
02:08:30,647 --> 02:08:31,762
I say to you,

1259
02:08:31,887 --> 02:08:37,280
if happiness encounters you, then,
you cannot count on it.

1260
02:08:37,567 --> 02:08:39,683
In a dull job.

1261
02:08:39,847 --> 02:08:42,520
In an office, a hospital, a school.

1262
02:08:43,367 --> 02:08:45,517
Perhaps a playground.

1263
02:08:45,647 --> 02:08:47,444
This just occurred to me.

1264
02:08:48,007 --> 02:08:51,761
Often, when I go to play with the twins,

1265
02:08:52,407 --> 02:08:55,285
I see the young mothers,
who sit their with their gazes,

1266
02:08:55,407 --> 02:08:58,797
which go straight through their offspring,
into the distance.

1267
02:08:58,927 --> 02:09:02,317
The women sit there and smoke one cigarette after another.

1268
02:09:02,447 --> 02:09:03,926
You must check it ouut sometime,

1269
02:09:04,047 --> 02:09:08,563
they lie there at the edge of the sandpit.

1270
02:09:12,887 --> 02:09:14,639
Hey, look here.

1271
02:09:16,007 --> 02:09:19,238
Do you know, Dorli,
we are like powderkegs.

1272
02:09:20,327 --> 02:09:23,558
You simply need to strike a match.

1273
02:09:27,367 --> 02:09:29,835
When someone goes by ...

1274
02:09:32,127 --> 02:09:34,561
Naturally invisible for the city.

1275
02:09:36,447 --> 02:09:39,325
The squaw brings the big chief ...

1276
02:09:40,847 --> 02:09:42,803
... his breakfast.

1277
02:09:43,647 --> 02:09:47,845
And I try to remember,
what I dreamt.

1278
02:09:58,007 --> 02:10:00,123
Has my soul finally arrived?

1279
02:10:00,567 --> 02:10:02,239
Now I know it again.

1280
02:10:02,487 --> 02:10:07,641
Staves, which turn themelves 
into spaghetti when they're played. Idiotic.

1281
02:10:08,167 --> 02:10:09,680
Ah!

1282
02:10:10,487 --> 02:10:12,284
Do you want milk in your coffee?

1283
02:10:12,967 --> 02:10:14,764
No.

1284
02:10:16,847 --> 02:10:18,405
- Milk?
- Yes!

1285
02:10:19,967 --> 02:10:21,605
Sugar?

1286
02:10:23,967 --> 02:10:26,003
- No, none.
- None?

1287
02:10:26,687 --> 02:10:29,440
This evening, Helga's parents 
are holding a birthday party.

1288
02:10:29,567 --> 02:10:33,162
But don't worry, 
there's definitely no spaghetti.

1289
02:10:34,647 --> 02:10:37,764
- How is your back?
- Take a look.

1290
02:10:45,967 --> 02:10:50,040
Marianne's oinment is wonderful,
it's already much better.

1291
02:10:52,487 --> 02:10:54,239
Hermann ...

1292
02:10:57,007 --> 02:11:00,761
Hermann, leave that now.
Only only comes in dreams.

1293
02:11:02,007 --> 02:11:04,726
Awake, all men are the same.

1294
02:11:09,847 --> 02:11:11,883
The weather's nice again today.

1295
02:11:18,367 --> 02:11:20,323
Are you in love with Hermann?

1296
02:11:25,927 --> 02:11:27,679
Hermann is the same as me.

1297
02:11:29,087 --> 02:11:31,647
He is always looking for something,

1298
02:11:31,767 --> 02:11:34,565
Like the mad wanderers 
of the old stories.

1299
02:11:37,967 --> 02:11:40,356
Perhaps it's overstated, butr ...

1300
02:11:40,487 --> 02:11:43,206
when one is like that, 
one must remain alone.

1301
02:11:45,487 --> 02:11:47,159
And how does he relate to you?

1302
02:11:48,607 --> 02:11:51,326
Do you know what he thinks of you?

1303
02:11:53,567 --> 02:11:55,319
Do you know what I think?

1304
02:11:56,287 --> 02:12:00,075
Hermann cannot love, 
because he's incomprehensible.

1305
02:12:01,967 --> 02:12:06,483
Every time you think you've caught him, 
he's already far away.

1306
02:12:08,127 --> 02:12:12,279
What I seek in particular 
is a story with an exit.

1307
02:12:12,887 --> 02:12:18,120
But the exit doesn't lead out.
It leads into the interior of the machine.

1308
02:12:19,167 --> 02:12:23,319
My life is a train which 
crashes through time.

1309
02:12:23,887 --> 02:12:26,640
Around 24 pictures a second.

1310
02:12:32,287 --> 02:12:34,482
So ... arrived.

1311
02:12:34,967 --> 02:12:37,686
You don't see anything, Lulu.

1312
02:12:37,927 --> 02:12:39,918
Lulu, what then?

1313
02:12:42,727 --> 02:12:45,036
Calm, sounds ...

1314
02:12:45,407 --> 02:12:47,762
noises, electronic sounds ...

1315
02:12:47,927 --> 02:12:50,964
Texts, poems ...
all interwoven.

1316
02:12:51,127 --> 02:12:54,039
And when I entered this jungle of sounds,

1317
02:12:54,167 --> 02:12:57,159
something else stepped into the foreground,
a string quartett.

1318
02:12:57,287 --> 02:13:00,563
- the sound of the spheres.
- Please, a moment.

1319
02:13:01,087 --> 02:13:03,681
I conduct the investigation.
Don't come to me with your ideas.

1320
02:13:03,847 --> 02:13:05,803
But we should talk about ...

1321
02:13:06,927 --> 02:13:09,839
- We project the images into each other.
- Yes.

1322
02:13:10,527 --> 02:13:12,358
- Interweave them like tones.
- Aha.

1323
02:13:13,527 --> 02:13:16,325
We let the loudspeaker 
rotate above our heads.

1324
02:13:16,487 --> 02:13:19,320
- On 100 screens, the sun goes down.
- Beautiful.

1325
02:13:19,487 --> 02:13:23,082
Or it snows.
It snows over everything which you see.

1326
02:13:23,767 --> 02:13:25,519
In the music too?

1327
02:13:35,007 --> 02:13:38,317
- Herr Stürmer?
- Have you got a moment, please.

1328
02:13:42,487 --> 02:13:44,682
Herr Stürmer,
That's top notch

1329
02:13:44,807 --> 02:13:47,924
how you instruct people
to set up the camera.

1330
02:13:48,047 --> 02:13:51,835
That is your talent, 
you do it with the wrist.

1331
02:13:53,007 --> 02:13:57,319
It's like that for me, 
when I'm with the bank people.

1332
02:13:57,567 --> 02:13:59,842
I know which buttons to press,

1333
02:13:59,967 --> 02:14:04,165
to get them to finance us. 
That's my talent.

1334
02:14:04,287 --> 02:14:07,643
We complement each other, 
together we're a whole.

1335
02:14:07,807 --> 02:14:10,196
Watch out! That's 
where the camera stands!

1336
02:14:23,167 --> 02:14:28,241
Here it stands: 'Magimobile',
'Transoptal Vision',

1337
02:14:28,527 --> 02:14:32,156
'Kairo Kinetische Vision',
'Ars Nova Vision',

1338
02:14:32,647 --> 02:14:37,437
''Musi Vision'', ''Multi Vision'',
''Varia Vision''.

1339
02:14:37,807 --> 02:14:40,401
'Mediascope' und 'Megascope'.

1340
02:14:42,127 --> 02:14:47,360
I would like to see our letters there.

1341
02:14:55,727 --> 02:14:58,639
lnternational ... 
Reportage Association.

1342
02:15:00,767 --> 02:15:03,839
- Reportage sounds so journalistic.
- It's also so long.

1343
02:15:03,967 --> 02:15:06,765
Perhaps something else ...

1344
02:15:08,527 --> 02:15:11,200
- The world is round.
- Rotation ....

1345
02:15:14,767 --> 02:15:17,361
- Realisation ...
- Journey ...

1346
02:15:17,527 --> 02:15:19,199
Journey, yes, journey.

1347
02:15:20,127 --> 02:15:23,802
- ... Route.
- No, I'm for Varia Vision.

1348
02:15:24,607 --> 02:15:28,759
It's open, we don't need to fix it, 
we can change it later.

1349
02:15:28,927 --> 02:15:29,962
- Hm.
- Hm.

1350
02:15:58,807 --> 02:16:00,240
He looks at me.

1351
02:16:02,287 --> 02:16:05,085
In this moment he 
has recognised me.

1352
02:16:05,807 --> 02:16:09,243
He thinks of me.
He anticipates that I'll come.

1353
02:16:09,527 --> 02:16:12,599
Champagne, 
the people's drink of the future.

1354
02:16:12,767 --> 02:16:14,883
Give Erika some more.

1355
02:16:15,127 --> 02:16:16,765
So, here, Herr Zielke.

1356
02:16:17,087 --> 02:16:20,921
Come my love.
It's lovely.

1357
02:16:22,007 --> 02:16:27,639
The American administration 
made me mayor after the war.

1358
02:16:27,967 --> 02:16:31,039
- And I can tell you ...
- Herr Fingerlein.

1359
02:16:31,207 --> 02:16:35,405
I will never forget you 
for what you have done for me.

1360
02:16:36,167 --> 02:16:40,922
It was simply wonderful.
I was totally penniless ...

1361
02:16:41,087 --> 02:16:43,442
We were all penniless then.

1362
02:16:43,607 --> 02:16:46,565
The only thing we had was hope.

1363
02:16:46,727 --> 02:16:51,642
Hope was our capital.
We had nothing and started from scratch!

1364
02:16:51,807 --> 02:16:55,686
We built our business and were like a family.

1365
02:16:56,287 --> 02:16:57,959
Where is Erika?

1366
02:17:02,367 --> 02:17:06,758
- I can't tolerate all this film chatter.
- It all hides something.

1367
02:17:14,647 --> 02:17:17,878
Shall we have another 
glass of wine somewhere?

1368
02:17:19,967 --> 02:17:21,719
At mine?

1369
02:17:21,887 --> 02:17:25,675
I need to concentrate now.
I'll disturb him.

1370
02:17:28,247 --> 02:17:30,397
- Is it near?
- Hermann.

1371
02:17:30,527 --> 02:17:32,199
- You'll see.
- Can you hear me?

1372
02:17:32,327 --> 02:17:35,603
But don't be shocked,
my flat is tiny.

1373
02:17:35,767 --> 02:17:38,122
Hermann, do you hear me?

1374
02:17:48,647 --> 02:17:50,319
I'll show you something.

1375
02:18:51,927 --> 02:18:53,326
Katrin.

1376
02:18:55,927 --> 02:19:00,000
I'll close this case carefully,
they haven't noticed.

1377
02:19:00,287 --> 02:19:04,405
And the genie is trapped 
for the next 1000 years

1378
02:19:04,607 --> 02:19:07,838
- Where is your child?
- With my parents.

1379
02:19:09,767 --> 02:19:11,837
ln Dülmen.

1380
02:19:16,887 --> 02:19:19,003
I still often think of Dülmen.

1381
02:19:19,927 --> 02:19:21,406
An end to cinema.

1382
02:19:26,927 --> 02:19:28,963
How do I get away from here?

1383
02:19:31,247 --> 02:19:34,637
I don't belong to you.
I don't belong to you.

1384
02:19:35,247 --> 02:19:37,522
I don't belong to you.

1385
02:19:37,687 --> 02:19:39,837
I want to become invisible.

1386
02:19:56,527 --> 02:20:00,520
That means, that one day 
one's gaze turns back.

1387
02:20:01,367 --> 02:20:04,086
On this day, youth ends.

1388
02:20:04,927 --> 02:20:08,476
In the first moment of terror, 
it appears to be a loss.

1389
02:20:08,647 --> 02:20:11,366
What made one so happy until then?

1390
02:20:24,767 --> 02:20:26,837
But then you can wake up.

1391
02:20:31,287 --> 02:20:33,437
You have finally arrived.

1392
02:20:56,367 --> 02:20:58,323
I open my eyes ...

1393
02:20:59,567 --> 02:21:01,637
I breathe ...

1394
02:21:09,727 --> 02:21:15,006
I can for once exactly determine 
what is here and now,

1395
02:21:27,607 --> 02:21:30,565
And I am both inside and outside.

1396
02:21:33,207 --> 02:21:35,846
In me the bright 'I' 
and outside, the world.

1397
02:21:47,687 --> 02:21:52,841
I can go in both directions.
Into time and out onto it.

1398
02:22:13,927 --> 02:22:16,236
I am free, I live.
