Afternoon gents, how's it going?

187
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,509
How are we today?

188
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,510
We're fine.

189
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,596
Although I just found out
that Josef and Else have left,

190
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:49,264
so I've been doing the apples all morning.

191
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,099
What are the gloves for?

192
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,268
I'm sick of seeing this pile,
thought I’d lend a hand.

193
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,355
But we've only got the two axes.

194
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,857
We couldn't find the other one.

195
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,483
[GRIGORY] Maybe Josef took it?

196
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,985
I'll have a look later.

197
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,737
Okay fine.
I'll load this onto the Animal,

198
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,071
you guys carry on.

Hello.

228
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,313
And good afternoon,
or is this the evening?

229
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,397
When does the evening start?

230
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:27,482
When does the evening start?

231
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,902
I suppose when the sun starts to set?

232
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,738
You know, when it starts to go down?

233
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,451
Let's just agree that it's late in the day,

234
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,411
and this is my property you're on,

235
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,372
and I'm sorry
I still don't know who you are.

236
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:45,291
- Your name?
- Yes, my name is Jamie.

237
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,627
- And you are with...?
- Just myself today.

238
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,712
No, I mean do you have any ID?

239
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:50,755
It's in my vehicle.

240
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,006
Im looking for someone.

241
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,510
I'm the owner of Plum Farm,
so i'm in charge here.

242
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,012
Were looking for someone
to talk about produce?

243
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:00,640
No, just that i'm looking for someone.

244
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,226
Have you seen anyone new in recent days?

245
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:03,810
New?

246
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,018
New?

247
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,728
Anyone you've not met before.

248
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,689
Here, on this, farm.

249
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:10,066
Or the area around the farm?

250
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,611
No I can't say that I have seen anyone new,

251
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,322
Just the usual faces, all familiar now.

252
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:17,991
Is this your domicile?

253
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,826
My domicile?

254
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:21,911
Yes, mine and my husbands.

255
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:22,704
May I speak with him?

256
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,581
No, he's away on business.

257
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,000
And what of these smaller domociles?

258
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:29,586
The caravans are for my workers,

259
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:31,838
and as I said before,
I know each and every one of them.

260
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:32,672
and as I said before,
I know each and every one of them.

261
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,465
No, new faces here.

262
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,759
Now I'm very sorry,
but I have to sort my eggs for delivery,

263
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:38,219
as it's almost evening now.

264
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,054
You're welcome to come back later

265
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,723
and talk to my workers
once they've finished.

266
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,850
You'll find all of their papers in order

267
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,602
and the farm's too for that matter.

268
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:47,979
Any other problems, you can
come and see me again,

269
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,439
or give me a call.

270
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:54,652

Excuse me, Jodie?

[JODIE] Hey guys, what's up?

276
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:39,447
Go on, Aggie.

277
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,077
Who was that woman earlier?

278
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,704
She looked important.

279
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,414
To be honest, I'm not sure.

280
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:51,334
Okay, where are Pyotr and Grigory?

281
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:52,669
Okay, where are Pyotr and Grigory?

282
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,254
[AGATHA] They went to the pub.

283
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:57,799
The Crooked Arm? That's 10 miles.

284
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,009
It means they're always sober
when they get home.

285
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,094
Or they think they are. [laughs]

286
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:06,349
Look, I don't want anyone to worry,
because it seems like nothing.

287
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,018
But, well, you should know.

288
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,521
She was just snooping around
looking for someone,

289
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:14,440
She didn't say much,
she didn't say anything at all.

290
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,820
I guess she works for the government-
I, I, forgot to ask... [sighs]

291
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,155
Maybe I should have pressed her, it's-

00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,078
the point is...

295
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,497
I don't think it's anything serious.

296
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,626
I'm sure it's nothing.

297
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,545
And she didn't say who she was looking for?

298
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:36,879
No, just...

299
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,924
Just tell me if you see anyone suspicious.

300
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,634
No- anyone new.

301
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,180

[IRMANTE] It's nothing, really.

367
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:49,734
Show her.

368
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,777
Show me what?

369
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,154
Come on...

370
00:26:57,575 --> 00:26:59,785
What am I looking at?
Looks like a flashlight.

371
00:26:59,827 --> 00:27:02,705
[IRMANTE] He says it was in the sky,
that they went to have a look.

372
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:08,169
Look guys they're at the pub,
I'm sure they'll show up.

373
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,845
Did you tell them what I told you last night?

374
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,976
[IRMANTE] Leave it, Aggie...

375
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,854
I texted them. I let them know.

376
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,023
[IRMANTE] Don't worry, I doubt it's that.

377
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,816
Right. Of course.

378
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:33,944
Shit. Okay.

379
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,655
You load the eggs on The Animal,
I'll chop some wood.

380
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,283
- [IRMANTE] Let us help you.
- Eggs.

381
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,826
I've got this.

382
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:51,087

383
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,510

00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:45,970

[deep breaths]

427
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,742
Right.

428
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,537
- You really think so?
- Absolutely.

429
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:19,248
Pyotr and Grigory are fun, but,

430
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:22,751
at the end of the day they get into
more bad than they do good.

431
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,629
Would it really surprise you if they've run off?

432
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,923
Well what about the lights?

433
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,466
Please.

434
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,719
Just one last practical joke.

435
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,555
You think it's coincidence
they run off same night

436
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:36,473
that woman from government
was snooping around?

437
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:38,225
No one said she was from the government.

438
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,310
Then where else would she be from?

439
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,898
Irmante.

440
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,608
Be honest.

441
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,902
Do you feel welcome here anymore?

442
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:56,702
[AGATHA] Why else do you think Josef and Else
were so happy to head to the city?

443
00:33:56,702 --> 00:33:58,203
It's no better.

444
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,164
How do you know?

445
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,623
London could be.

446
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:03,667
My brother's happy there.

447
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,419
London voted in.

448
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:07,880
Let's not talk about this.

449
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,382
People have changed.

450
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:11,091
[gasp]

451
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,593
Hello there.

452
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,178
[eerie music]

453
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:15,596
Hello.

454
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,849
You were at our farm yesterday.

455
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:19,391
[WOMAN IN BLACK] The farm yes.
I spoke with your superior.

456
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,435
[WOMAN IN BLACK] The farm yes.
I spoke with your superior.

457
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,562
My colleague and I were wondering
if you'd seen anybody new in the area.

458
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,814
My colleague and I were wondering
if you'd seen anybody new in the area.

459
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,067
- No.
- [MAN] More volume!

460
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,027
[IRMANTE] No.

461
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:32,279
As our 'superior' told you: no one.

462
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,948
We are all here legally.

463
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,325
At least I know for a fact that I am,

464
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:37,367
and she is.

465
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:42,414
Come on Agatha. We have to
get this food back to the farm.

466
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,374
People are expecting us.

467
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:50,214
[IRMANTE] Don't look back.

468
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:51,423
[IRMANTE] Don't look back.

469
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,051
Okay, you win. Let's talk.

470
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:59,431
[eerie music]

471
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,071
[faucet drips]

472
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:25,207
[electric buzzing]

473
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,252
[sighs] Fuck's sake.

474
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,295
[buzzing stops]

475
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,465
[mysterious music]

476
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,315
[approaching footsteps]

477
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,156
This doesn't look good.

478
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:01,493
We need to talk.

479
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,954
So you're leaving?

480
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,712
We still haven't seen Pyotr and Grigory,

481
00:36:12,921 --> 00:36:16,049
and with that woman yesterday
we think that maybe it is time to move on.

482
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,678
- [JODIE] But there's still a few days work to do-
- You have to understand,

483
00:36:19,678 --> 00:36:22,890
we don't want trouble, and it's harder now.

484
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,434
We don't want to risk what we have, Jodie.

485
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,104
And those lights-
something's not right here.

486
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,901
I'm sorry Jodie.

487
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,486
What about your pay?

488
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,613
Here.

489
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,406
[IRMANTE] This is where we'll be.

490
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,491
You can contact us there.

491
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:43,577
It's where Josef got the work in Surrey.

492
00:36:43,577 --> 00:36:45,495
We think it could be good for us.

493
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,248
[AGATHA] It's just that woman
and with what's happening,

494
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,334
it'll be better there than here.

495
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,337
But you have nothing to worry about.

496
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:56,214
We can call the police about Pyotr and Grigory.

497
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,509
[IRMANTE] Please, Jodie, we are so thankful to you.

498
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,095
You and Sam are fantastic,

499
00:37:02,095 --> 00:37:04,306
but it's time for us to move on.

500
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,059
And Josef has found us
something immediate,

501
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,769
it's now or never.

502
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,856
Okay.

503
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,817
Okay.

504
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,695
I'll get you some food and water
for the journey.

505
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:34,002
[deep breath]

506
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,796

[ringing stops]

509
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,471
- Hey.
- [SAM] Hey you!

510
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:47,474
I wanted to call earlier but
couldn't get away from Terry again.

511
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,935
Everything okay?

512
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,772
- Jodie?
- Yeah, everything it's, fine, it's fine.

513
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,316
It's so good to hear you.
Oh baby i've missed you.

514
00:37:56,316 --> 00:38:00,404
Before I forget, the lights surged again
like the other night,

515
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:02,030
that's three times now.

516
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,574
Why don't you call the neighbour
and see if he's had the same thing?

517
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,034
Sam, do I have to?

518
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:06,910
Jodie.

519
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:11,790
Okay, fine, I will.
But it's definitely not the fuses.

520
00:38:12,374 --> 00:38:13,667
Anything else going on?

521
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:16,837
Jodie?

522
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,756
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

523
00:38:22,426 --> 00:38:23,969
When you're back.

524
00:38:26,013 --> 00:38:27,222
I love you.

525
00:38:27,431 --> 00:38:28,724
I love you too.

526
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,852

I'm sorry I was just looking-

No, you were sneaking!

670
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,732
Last time you came to the farmhouse
during working hours- that's fine.

671

That's what normal people do.

672
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:13,193
So, once again.

673
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:17,197
This is my property and as you're here
without my permission,

674
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,991
you are trespassing.

675
01:00:20,034 --> 01:00:21,410
Have you seen anyone?

676
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,245
No.

677
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:25,664
Did you find the person you were looking for?

678
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,541
No, we're still in the process of looking,

679
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,418

Not here, you're not.

684

686
01:00:38,886 --> 01:00:40,262

Are you sure you haven't seen anyone new?

691
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:56,570
As I said, no.

692
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,866
All of my workers have left, and
my husband will be returning soon.

693
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:02,201
In the meantime,

694
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:04,328
my cousin is staying with me
back at the farmhouse.

695
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:05,454
I'm not alone.

696
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,330
May I speak with him?

697
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,874
No you may not- leave now.

698
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,543
In fact,

699
01:01:11,543 --> 01:01:13,253
I'd like to make a formal complaint.

700
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:15,923

did you say you work for?

701
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:18,050
Goodbye, Miss.

01:01:56,797 --> 01:01:57,756
That woman.

706
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:00,384
You're running.

709
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:24,700
[JODIE] Here.

710
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,913
This is where we are right now.

711
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,343
Here.

712
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:02,571
Here.

713
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:10,078

720
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,848
You are from up there.

721
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:56,435
Those lights were you.

722
01:04:57,853 --> 01:04:59,646
Those light surges, that was you.

723
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:03,984
But there were lots of surges.

724
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:09,031
That must mean there's more
than just that woman looking for you.

725
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,707
Whoever they are,

726
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,877
you are safe here.

727
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:25,589

[SAM] Oh baby, I thought you'd never pick up.
You alright?

732
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:45,525
Yeah.

733
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,695
Well sort of. All the workers left.

734
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,156
- What?!
- No! It's okay, everything's alright.

735
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:52,699
Most of the picking's done, and-

736
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:53,950

Primary progressive MS effects about

10 to 15 percent of people diagnosed with MS.

815
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,497
10 to 15 percent of people diagnosed with MS.

816
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:13,293
It is called this because
from the first primary symptoms,

817
01:10:13,585 --> 01:10:14,544
it is progressive.

818
01:10:15,045 --> 01:10:17,172
Symptoms gradually get worse over time,

819
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:20,675
rather than appear as sudden attacks,
or relapses.

People with primary progressive MS

- Why are problems with the legs so common?
- [violent stomach noises]

828
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:38,318
Well a likely reason is that

829
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:41,613
primary progressive MS tends
to involve the spinal chord,

830
01:10:42,197 --> 01:10:45,784
a vital part of the nervous system
for controlling this part of the body.

can accompany problems with the legs.

834
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,501
These parts of the body also rely heavily

835
01:10:54,501 --> 01:10:55,961

It's just me.

923
01:19:16,669 --> 01:19:18,212
Can I see some identification?

924
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:23,009
It's Andy, only my mum calls me Andrew.

925
01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:26,929
Tea?

926
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,097
[ANDY] Thank you but no.

927
01:19:28,306 --> 01:19:29,724
I was just at the end of myself shift

928
01:19:29,724 --> 01:19:31,559
and you're the last house I have to check on-

929
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:33,394
well bar your vacant neighbour,

930
01:19:33,394 --> 01:19:34,437
the only house.

931
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:37,064
How can I help?

932
01:19:37,482 --> 01:19:39,901
Well you see a couple of people
have gone missing in the area,

933
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:43,654
and we're just canvassing to see
if you've noticed anything amiss.

934
01:19:43,946 --> 01:19:45,865
I see your caravans are empty.

935
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,743
Yes, the workers left a few days ago.

936
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:50,870
Seasonal help?

937
01:19:50,912 --> 01:19:52,288
Yes, all registered.

938
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,956
I have their details if you want them.

939
01:19:54,123 --> 01:19:54,832
What, local?

940
01:19:55,333 --> 01:19:57,293
Better than that, mostly Eastern European.

941
01:19:57,877 --> 01:19:58,628
Right.

942
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:01,047
But when did they go missing?

943
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:02,590
About three nights ago.

944
01:20:02,882 --> 01:20:05,760
You haven't noticed anything
strange in the area?

945
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:10,097
Madam?

946
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:12,391
Not that I can think of.

947
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,937
My husband's been away on business-
he's an architect,

948
01:20:15,937 --> 01:20:17,647
and I've just been so busy with the farm

949
01:20:17,647 --> 01:20:20,149
that honestly if anything had gone amiss
I probably wouldn't notice.

950
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,319
Had company did we?

951
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:25,738
Oh, no! [sigh]

952
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:28,533
Please understand it's just me here,

953
01:20:28,658 --> 01:20:31,953
and I haven't cleared up
after the last few meals.

954
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,289
How embarrassing,
you must think i'm a monster!

955
01:20:35,289 --> 01:20:36,123
[laughter]

956
01:20:36,123 --> 01:20:38,751
Not at all, you should see
the state of my domicile.

957
01:20:38,751 --> 01:20:41,170
- [eerie music]
- Just picture takeaway boxes everywhere

958
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:42,171
instead of plates.

959
01:20:43,047 --> 01:20:45,550
Look i'm sorry constable, but as I said,

960
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,260
I've been really busy with the farm,

961
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:49,303
- I should think about turning in.
- Not a problem.

962
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,013
I'll just leave you my card.

963
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,267
So you can ring me,
or any of the officers on duty,

964
01:20:54,267 --> 01:20:57,353
- if you remember anything.
- Thanks.

965
01:21:02,942 --> 01:21:04,694
[suspicious music]

966
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:09,115
[laughs]

967
01:21:10,241 --> 01:21:11,409
Something funny, madam?

968
01:21:13,953 --> 01:21:16,539
We used to live in London
before we moved out here last year,

969
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:19,792
and I just realised that
that was the last time I saw a policeman.

970
01:21:20,501 --> 01:21:21,627
I've never seen one out here.

971
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,046
Sounds about right.

972
01:21:24,422 --> 01:21:25,548
Well, have a good evening madam.

973
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:26,632
You too.

974
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:28,759
[receding footsteps]

975
01:21:49,572 --> 01:21:51,198

[footsteps approaching]

981
01:23:10,444 --> 01:23:12,113
[gasp] Stop doing that!

982
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,074
Two of the workers who lived here,

983
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:16,575
I don't know if they ran off,

984
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:17,702
or if they're coming back.

985
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,455
They went to the woods,
somebody said they saw lights.

986
01:23:21,455 --> 01:23:23,582
In the sky?
But I don't know if those lights were you

987
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:25,793
or if they were that woman
who was here before.

988
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:27,378
[exasperated sigh]

989
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,588
You have no idea
what i'm saying, do you?

990
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:31,590
Shit.

991
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,052
Maybe I should have mentioned
something to that policeman.

992
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:39,056
What if the people that are looking for you,

993
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,142
what if they're behind
these people going missing?

994
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:42,143
What if...

995
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:46,522
Okay.

996
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:49,608
I've got an idea for tomorrow.

997
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:53,446
Come with me.

998
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:04,373
[shotgun blast]

999
01:24:04,665 --> 01:24:06,333

- [shells being loaded]
- [gun snapping closed]

1003
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:27,354
No, no!

1004
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,398
Never do that!

1005
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:31,150
Never.

1006
01:24:31,984 --> 01:24:32,860
You never know.

1007
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:34,153
Okay?

1008
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:37,490
[gun blast impression]

1009
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:39,033
[exploding impression]

1010
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:48,375
Oh, sorry.

1011
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:55,925
Just copy me.

1012
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:20,407
No.

1013
01:25:21,367 --> 01:25:23,577
No, this isn't going to work.

1014
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:26,997
Come with me.

1015
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:27,832
Right.

1016
01:25:28,123 --> 01:25:30,376
They come, you hide under.

1017
01:25:31,293 --> 01:25:32,086
Okay?

1018
01:25:32,962 --> 01:25:34,129
They come.

1019
01:25:34,547 --> 01:25:36,173
You hide.

1020
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,218
Oh wait, one more thing.

1021
01:25:44,265 --> 01:25:45,432
[footsteps]

1022
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,688
Just in case.

1023
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:54,942
Jesus christ I hope you're getting this.

1024
01:25:57,945 --> 01:25:58,821
[knife knocking the bed frame]

1025
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:04,076
Okay.

1026
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:05,911
Let's get to work.

1027
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:13,043

[soft dramatic music continues]

1031
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:24,323
I need you to do something for me.

1032
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:27,076
It's a big ask.

1033
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:39,546
She means everything to me.

1034
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:41,382
And I haven't been able to ride her-

1035
01:27:42,508 --> 01:27:44,385
[strange vibration increasing]

1036
01:27:44,385 --> 01:27:45,511
- That's enough!
- [strange vibration stops]

1037
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:48,889
That's more than enough!

1038
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:51,558
Thank you!

1039
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:57,272

I wish you could talk to me.

1046
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,526
Tell me what your world is like.

1047
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:47,364
Is it a world?

1048
01:28:52,911 --> 01:28:54,997
I suppose if it was nice
you wouldn't be running.

1049
01:28:55,622 --> 01:28:56,457
Or hiding.

1050
01:28:58,459 --> 01:28:59,626
Is that what this is?

1051
01:29:04,006 --> 01:29:05,049
That woman,

1052
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,009
the woman who was here,

1053
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:09,094
I didn't like the way she made me feel,
talking to her.

1054
01:29:10,012 --> 01:29:11,680
But you, you...

1055
01:29:13,182 --> 01:29:14,516
You're more like a child.

1056

[laughs]

1057
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:19,646
No it's more than that.

1058
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:24,693
I trust you.

1059
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:32,409
Wish you could understand
what I was saying.

1060
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,706
There's so much that I want to know.

1061
01:29:47,800 --> 01:29:49,176
We should go to the eggs.

1062
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:06,819
But we need to-

1063
01:30:10,781 --> 01:30:11,532
Wait!

1064
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:13,367
Wait!

1065
01:30:14,451 --> 01:30:16,829
We'll take a break, but just this once!

1068
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,194
Well, I'm impressed.

1069
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,447
The right tea, the right mug.

1070
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:00,622
Pretty damn good.

[laughs]

1072
01:31:17,514 --> 01:31:19,349
So, I was thinking about,

01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:23,770
all the things
you may not have experienced,

1074
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:24,771
and...

1075
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:27,774
Well, one of them was...

['Responder' by Teeth of the Sea plays]

1077

No, no, wait, it's good, but wait...

1078
01:31:53,008 --> 01:31:54,134
When it kicks in...

1079
01:31:55,469 --> 01:31:56,678
- Here.
- [the music beat kicks in]

1080
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:03,602
Yeah?

1081
01:32:20,786 --> 01:32:22,329
Sam and I used to live in London.

1082
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:24,998
We used to go out all over,

1083
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,626
and Teeth of the Sea,

1084
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:28,752
live?

1085
01:32:29,461 --> 01:32:30,504
Oh man...

1086
01:32:31,129 --> 01:32:32,422
and this track?

1087
01:32:32,798 --> 01:32:34,466
It was everything.

1088
01:32:38,804 --> 01:32:40,639
It wasn't just the booze and...

1089
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:43,392
the other shit. It was...

1090
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,144
It was more than that, it was...

1091
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,272
music...

1092
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:51,191

01:34:42,636 --> 01:34:44,137
I just need to go out for a minute.

1096

No. Please.

No!

1100
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:52,479
You shouldn't.

1101
01:34:53,313 --> 01:34:54,731
I just need to...

1102
01:35:07,911 --> 01:35:08,954
Okay.

1103
01:35:09,788 --> 01:35:11,289
Let's get out of here.
