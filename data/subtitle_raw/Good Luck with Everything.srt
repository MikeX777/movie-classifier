1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:01,733
(waves crashing)

2
00:00:01,734 --> 00:00:04,401
(gentle music)

3
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:25,782
- Hi, Paul, thank you
so much for doing this.

4
00:00:25,783 --> 00:00:28,207
It's like last minute re-shoots,

5
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:31,623
so you are saving my butt again.

6
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:38,103
Okay, dog stuff, so
lockbox wag code is 201

7
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,966
but I think I wrote that down,

8
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,543
should be maybe on the fridge.

9
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:47,239
When they eat, T's really
particular about his food

10
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,940
and will just like stare at
it for a really long time.

11
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,159
That's his choice, sure.

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,973
But if you can just push all
the bowls quite close together,

13
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,891
I feel like it gives him some
incentive to hurry up an eat

14
00:01:01,892 --> 00:01:06,823
which would be much easier and
more efficient for everyone.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,549
If you can put just like
a little bit of water

16
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:13,826
with their food as well,

17
00:01:13,827 --> 00:01:15,689
just so it's like cereal,

18
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:19,283
apparently it's good for
their digestion, maybe.

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,039
Actually, while I'm away,

20
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
put Ripley's bowl in
the spare room to eat,

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,289
she gets a bit territorial about her food

22
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,339
and then we'll try to
go after the other ones.

23
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,666
So, I mean, she's like
usually really good about it,

24
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,943
but maybe just while
I'm away, just in case.

25
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,713
Three walks a day.

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:47,539
So if you just look after
the first and the last,

27
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,689
like morning and night,

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,649
and then I'll have dog walker
come in while you're at work.

29
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,202
Barkley, he will bark at everything.

30
00:01:55,203 --> 00:01:57,159
(dogs barking)

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,129
Emery arrives tomorrow,

32
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,389
I'm so jealous that
I'm not gonna be there.

33
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,347
She's really awesome and
I think you will love her.

34
00:02:07,348 --> 00:02:12,034
And yeah, what a bummer,
I'm not gonna be there,

35
00:02:12,035 --> 00:02:14,423
which is always the way I feel like.

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,650
Oh, and if you can walk,

37
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:19,849
oh, sorry, transpo van is coming.

38
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,593
Okay, water the plants, if you can.

39
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:25,410
You're the best.

40
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:26,709
I love you so much.

41
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,829
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

42
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,028
Okay, I'll speak to you soon.

43
00:02:29,029 --> 00:02:29,812
(lips smacking)

44
00:02:29,862 --> 00:02:30,862
Bye.

45
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,803
- Hey Maggie, looks like you're
having fun in the big city.

46
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,259
We are all good here.

47
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,619
The dogs are not in the
living room with me,

48
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,893
but they are here.

49
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:49,159
I'm working tomorrow,

50
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,479
but on Wednesday and Thursday
you don't need a dog walker

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,359
because I'm not working.

52
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,859
And I can not wait to meet Emery.

53
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,004
She seems awesome, so.

54
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,389
Wish you were here too
but you keep having fun

55
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,299
and doing your thing in New York.

56
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,329
Oh, and I got your plants
covered, no worries, all right.

57
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,038
I'll talk to you soon, bye.

58
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,783
(lips smacking)

59
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:12,264
(car horn honking)

60
00:03:12,265 --> 00:03:14,943
- [Announcer] Loading dock
two, for intake four one five

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,670
- So Paul, what we're doing

62
00:03:25,671 --> 00:03:27,199
is we're reconfiguring the warehouse,

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
we're checking inventory up in the racks.

64
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,975
It need you to go to location, E01H5.

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,029
- It's like, why do I
hire a property manager,

66
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,626
if you're gonna call me as
much as the tenants would?

67
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:43,747
If you need a plumber

68
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,839
Call a plumber don't call me.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,036
Like I have a Rolodex of
plumbers and everything,

70
00:03:48,037 --> 00:03:49,129
that's your job.

71
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:52,839
- That's why I don't do
apartment real estate.

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,989
I mean, why do you have an extra job

73
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,949
when you have this one, you know?

74
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,300
- Why is that hard for you?

75
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,269
- [Paul] I'm just
understanding why you work here

76
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,099
and also have real estate, that's all.

77
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,659
- So what, I should just have real estate

78
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,759
and sit at home all day?

79
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,549
- [Paul] A lot of people
just have real estate.

80
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,540
- That's what you would do?

81
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,439
You would just sit home
all day, if you were me,

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,529
and not work?

83
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,513
It's a family thing, you know
that, it's my responsibility.

84
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,703
How's the breakup going, enjoying that?

85
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,579
- Yeah, it's fun to be alone.

86
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,469
I didn't look at her
Instagram all weekend,

87
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,809
so I chalk that up as a win.

88
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,489
- No, good for you.
- Yeah.

89
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,899
- That's a real big win for you.

90
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,260
- [Paul] Thanks man.

91
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:33,179
- Don't you think maybe you
should get over it by now?

92
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,239
- I know that, thank you.

93
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,619
- You guys were together,
what, three and a half,

94
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,609
three years, four years?

95
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,249
- Three and a half.
- Three and a half.

96
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,769
- Yeah.
- So that should take you.

97
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,799
- As much time as I need.

98
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,719
- Three and a half months
and you should be over it.

99
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,399
- Again, like, that's your
way of getting over somebody.

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,233
For some people it takes
more time, that's it.

101
00:04:48,234 --> 00:04:50,289
- You just like the simmer in it for years

102
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,009
and ruin any possible chance
for a real relationship.

103
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,569
- I have a different mindset

104
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,191
in the way in which I
fall in love with somebody

105
00:04:57,192 --> 00:04:58,989
than you do.
- Yeah, it's like,

106
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,919
I don't do it right when I see them.

107
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,679
- Break.
- What's that?

108
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,669
- Break up with them.
- No, I don't fall in love

109
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,529
with every girl I look at.

110
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,559
- I don't do that.
- Just because we have sex,

111
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,299
doesn't mean I'm going
to fall in love with you

112
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,626
and then freak you out and
send you running like you do.

113
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:16,709
- Hey, hey, Paul, can you
give Noelle a tour please?

114
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,902
- Yeah, sure.

115
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:18,736
- Hi.
- Hi.

116
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,016
Hey, I'm Paul.

117
00:05:20,017 --> 00:05:20,850
- Nice to meet you, Noelle.

118
00:05:20,851 --> 00:05:22,279
- Nice to meet you, hey.

119
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,349
- Lewis, Lewis.
- Nice to meet you.

120
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,317
- Lewis, Lewis, you hear that?

121
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:26,829
- Lewis, Lewis, got it.

122
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,080
- [Lewis] Enjoy the tour.

123
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,356
Enjoy the tour, Paul.

124
00:05:30,357 --> 00:05:31,440
- Yeah, fuck you.

125
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:34,549
So you're gonna need this first.

126
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,879
We have a pink one, but.
- This is good.

127
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,869
- Okay.
- Love it.

128
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,703
- You got it?
- Yeah.

129
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:45,113
- So I guess we'll start in
aisle N which is right here.

130
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,104
So aisle N has a lot of shirts.

131
00:05:51,105 --> 00:05:52,105
- Cool.

132
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,280
- Actually all the aisles
have a lot of shirts.

133
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,569
So yeah, we basically,

134
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,833
if we need a certain shirt,
we'll send a picker to grab it

135
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:09,748
and then a sorter will then get the shirts

136
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,239
that we need to ship out.
- Cool.

137
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,409
- What exactly are you hired to do?

138
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,440
- I'm a checker.

139
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:18,209
- Oh, okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

140
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,399
- I kinda, I check too.
- Right.

141
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,532
And you're the store man
manager, store foreman.

142
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:24,413
- I'm the foreman, yeah.
- Cool.

143
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,719
How long have you worked here?

144
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,939
- I've worked here for three years.

145
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
- Cool.
- Yeah.

146
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,260
- Do you live nearby?

147
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,589
- Right now, I'm house
sitting for a couple of dogs

148
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,789
and they're a little bit
of a handful, but yeah.

149
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,279
- Have you ever tried
using a laser pointer,

150
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,799
pointing around?
- With the dogs?

151
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,009
- Yeah, my girlfriend
does that with her cat.

152
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,319
It exhausts the crap out of them.

153
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,719
- Wears 'em out hah?
- Yeah, yeah.

154
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,179
- You have a girlfriend.
- Yeah.

155
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,180
- Cool.

156
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,713
So this aisle right here is aisle...

157
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,113
- C.
- Exactly.

158
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,617
(Paul laughing)

159
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,077
Where is it, where is it?

160
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,072
Ripley, don't come after me.

161
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:25,742
What do you guys want to
play tonight, Pictionary?

162
00:07:25,743 --> 00:07:26,664
- [Woman] Let's do variety.

163
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:27,913
- All right, yeah.

164
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,629
- Hey Paul, what's up?

165
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,949
I'm just calling to say hi,

166
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,313
I haven't heard from you in a little bit.

167
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,689
The kids were wanting to know

168
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,099
if you were coming to
the 4th of July cookout,

169
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,459
in our backyard,

170
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,689
which is a very big deal this year.

171
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,670
They're very excited.

172
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,389
They're in charge of the fireworks

173
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,219
and they said that they need your help.

174
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,129
So we'd love to have you.

175
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,563
Give me a call or text me and
let me know what your plan is.

176
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,799
And also just to say hi

177
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,119
'cause I haven't heard from you in a bit.

178
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,676
So anyway, I love you, okay.

179
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,021
Yeah, I'm coming.

180
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:00,022
Sorry.

181
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,910
- Hey Ally,

182
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,209
yeah. I don't know about 4th of July yet,

183
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,429
I don't know if I got it off yet.

184
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,272
So yeah, it seems you've
got a full house there,

185
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:23,139
so I won't keep you too long.

186
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,889
And I'll talk to you soon.

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,918
But yeah, I don't know yet, so.

188
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,063
All right, bye, love you.

189
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,482
(gentle upbeat music)

190
00:08:42,653 --> 00:08:45,736
(virtual gun firing)

191
00:09:13,599 --> 00:09:15,559
- [Lewis] We did eight
hundred lines before lunch.

192
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,393

193
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:17,919

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,319
- Busy day.

195
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,153
- Yes, sir.

196
00:09:21,154 --> 00:09:22,819

197
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,489
so we need to get that out by five,

198
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,259
so we need you there too, you know.

199
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,359
- Okay, I can be here for that.

200
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,895
- Good.

201
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:32,569
- You just thinking about lunch right now?

202
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,029
- A little bit, 'cause the

203
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,259
- Oh yeah.

204
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,399
- We're doing tacos.
- Let's do some tacos, great.

205
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,233
Cool.

00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:41,329

208
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,529
- [Paul] Okay, yeah, I

209
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,630

apartment, you know, quit moping,

210
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:51,189

00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,509
- Yeah, I might swing by.
- No, you'll come, just come.

212
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,783
Everybody's gonna be there,
it's gonna be a good time.

213
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
- All right, maybe.

214
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,503
- Everybody is coming over.

215
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,479
Everyone is coming over.
- Yeah, I know.

216
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,263
- Hey Noelle you still coming
tomorrow night to the party?

217
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,210
- Yep.

218
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,199
Why are you shouting?

219
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,296
- Because you're far.

220
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:16,397
I'll see you at lunch.

221
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:24,295
- Hey, you found the smoking corner.

222
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,748
- Hey, yo.
- Hey.

223
00:10:25,749 --> 00:10:27,843
- Mind if I take a seat with you.

224
00:10:27,844 --> 00:10:28,844
- Heck yeah.

225
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,000
- Smoking on the second day, huh?

226
00:10:40,169 --> 00:10:43,790
- Yeah, it keeps on, like going out.

227
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,791
- There you go.
- 'Cause it's so windy.

228
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,779
- That's good.
- You know what I'm saying.

229
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,930
- You liking it so far?

230
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:52,657
- Yeah.

231
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:54,089
Yeah, I like it.

232
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,319
- Good.
- It's fun.

233
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,260
- Yeah.

234
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:59,749
- How are you, how's, how's dog sitting?

235
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,710
- Dog sitting's great.

236
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:03,689
The laser pointer was a great idea.

237
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,560
- Really?
- Yeah.

238
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,429
They loved it.
- Knew it.

239
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,263
- They were literally running.

240
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:08,799
- They go nuts for that shit.
- It's insane.

241
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,249
They were running around and it was like,

242
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,489
it was hysterical.

243
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:16,023
- Sometimes I worry that it'll make,

244
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,009
it'll make like dogs or
cats kind of lose their mind

245
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:22,900
because it's this thing

246
00:11:22,901 --> 00:11:24,209
that'll just appear out of nowhere,

247
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,829
so then they're constantly
gonna be looking for now.

248
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,239
- Yeah, I saw that in Barkley's eyes.

249
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,919
Like, he like was like.
- Who's Barkley, the dog?

250
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,209
- Oh yeah, sorry, yeah, he's the dog.

251
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,839
Barkley, Theo and Ripley.
- Cute.

252
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,264
- Yeah, they're all really cute.

253
00:11:36,265 --> 00:11:38,589
But Barkley like would
just stand at attention,

254
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,385
kinda like this the whole time.

255
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:41,469
(Noelle laughing)

256
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,489
It's insane.

257
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:45,449
- You should see cats do
it, man, they're like nuts.

258
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,233
- They love it too.

259
00:11:46,283 --> 00:11:47,116
- I'm gonna use your back

260
00:11:47,117 --> 00:11:50,419
'cause the wind won't
let me keep my flame.

261
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,624
Hold on.
- Yeah, sure,

262
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:55,875
it's what it's there for.
- I'm gonna light you up.

263
00:11:57,059 --> 00:11:58,366
Do you want some pizza?

264
00:11:58,367 --> 00:11:59,379
- I'm okay, that's not.

265
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,379
- I found this on the fridge.

266
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,899
- That wasn't yours, but.

267
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,820
- Oh, you do know that.

268
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:05,226
- Yeah, no, that's Mario's.

269
00:12:05,227 --> 00:12:06,489
(Noelle laughing)

270
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,490
- Yeah.

271
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,399
- Mark said that it was
in the fridge for a while.

272
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,340
So I was like this is mine.

273
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,223
- I think Mark said that

274
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,509
because Mario brings it in every day.

275
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,404
So he has like a slice of pizza every day.

276
00:12:16,405 --> 00:12:17,238
(Noelle laughing)

277
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,769
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, so.

278
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:20,899
Mario's not gonna have lunch today,

279
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,816
but luckily the taco truck's here.

280
00:12:22,817 --> 00:12:24,479
(Noelle laughing)

281
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,839
- It's fucking good.
- Yeah.

282
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,272
- Italian bread.

283
00:12:27,273 --> 00:12:28,423
- He makes it.

284
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,939
- What?
- Yes.

285
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,519
- It's so good.

286
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,529
Oh my God.

287
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,699
- And Mark knows that too.

288
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,950
I think he was just like,

289
00:12:38,503 --> 00:12:39,729
that's not good.

290
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,910
- Well it fed me, fed my soul.
- Yeah.

291
00:12:41,911 --> 00:12:43,729
- I have to get back to work.

292
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,280
- Yeah, high as a kite, you're
ready to rock, go for it.

293
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:48,809
- All right, that's not gonna work.

294
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:49,810
- Yup.

295
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:53,029
- I was gonna do one of
those rolls, you know.

296
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,980
- Well, I didn't know
if you were trying to do

297
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:56,303
like a tuck and roll or just a.

298
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:57,190
- A what?

299
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,240
Yeah, tuck and roll.

300
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,959
(Noelle laughing)

301
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,313
- It's good hanging with you.

302
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:07,129
- I'll grab all these
matches, you're good,

303
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,430
you've got too much stuff.

304
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,050
Hey, what's going on Emery, how are ya?

305
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:18,713
Okay, great.

306
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,379
Five minutes, okay, let me,
I'll pull my car up a little bit

307
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,930
and you can just pull into
my spot behind me, okay.

308
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,090
I'm the Mazda.

309
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,919
So I'm the farthest one over to the left.

310
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,270
That's not gonna be your bed.

311
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,240
What's going on?

312
00:13:39,241 --> 00:13:41,519
- How's it going?
- Good.

313
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,959
- Good.

314
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,710
Sorry, I'm gonna roll up my window.

315
00:13:46,983 --> 00:13:49,829
I think I just rolled that
tree up into my window.

316
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:50,663
- It's okay.
- What's up?

317
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,009
- It's not my tree.

318
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,250
- Hey.
- Hey, how are ya?

319
00:13:53,251 --> 00:13:55,096
- I'm good, how are you?
- Nice to meet you.

320
00:13:55,097 --> 00:13:57,066
Oh, can I help you with your bags?

321
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,999
- No, no, no, I'll just grab my backpack,

322
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,859
that's all I need right now.
- Okay, cool.

323
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,639
- Oh my God, oh.
- Drive was okay?

324
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,399
Oh my God, so long, but
I'm so happy to be here.

325
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,609
- Right.
- Yeah.

326
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:08,520
- You're finally in LA.

327
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:10,359
- Oh my God, look at the babies.

328
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,919
- Yeah, so that's Barkley
on the right there.

329
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,679
And then Ripley is a little white guy.

330
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,680
- [Emery] Yes.

331
00:14:15,681 --> 00:14:17,159
- Living room.
- Cool.

332
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,130
- Okay.

333
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:20,305
Kitchen is in here.
- Nice.

334
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:21,089
- Alrighty.

335
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:21,972
And then the spare bedroom,

336
00:14:21,973 --> 00:14:24,438
where you're staying, right here.

337
00:14:24,439 --> 00:14:26,599
- Amazing.
- Alrighty.

338
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,433
- Thank you.
- You got it.

339
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:28,812
- This is so great.
- Yeah.

340
00:14:28,813 --> 00:14:30,479
Have you had dinner yet?

341
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,759
- No, have you eaten yet?
- I have not.

342
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,930
- Wanna get some food?
- Yeah.

343
00:14:34,931 --> 00:14:35,979
Let you set up here.
- Okay, cool.

344
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
- Cool.

345
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,660
So how long did it take
you to come on out?

346
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:49,943
- Like two and a half weeks.
- Okay.

347
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,399
- But I took time.

348
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,549
And it still didn't feel
like that much time,

349
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,973
but it was like, you know.

350
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,570
No, no you go.

351
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:03,189
- I was gonna say, did
you have a favorite stop?

352
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,963
- Oh my God, I love Montana,

353
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,639
I love New Mexico.

354
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,099
- I went through New
Mexico, that was good.

355
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,119
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

356
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,953
- You took a road trip?

357
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,159
- I did, I stopped in Santa Fe,

358
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,899
I actually got a ticket there.

359
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,900
- For what?

360
00:15:17,101 --> 00:15:21,129
- Well I was distracted,
which is not good driving,

361
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,633
but I was going 60 in a 35.

362
00:15:24,571 --> 00:15:25,404
- Okay.

363
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:28,509
- And that was in Tulum,
not, it's like Tatum, Mexico,

364
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,299
which is really New Mexico.

365
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,368
- Right.
- Super small.

366
00:15:32,369 --> 00:15:34,919
And then right after that
I hit a bird by accident.

367
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,699
Shouldn't have been going that fast.

368
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,732
- Poor bird.
- Yeah.

369
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:41,299
But it was a fun trip.

370
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,789
But New Mexico is beautiful.

371
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:44,519
Santa Fe with that sunset.

372
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,529
- I would live there so fast.
- Yeah.

373
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,349
- If there was like a legitimate way

374
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,072
for me to make money in New Mexico,

375
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:53,119
I would live there in a heartbeat.

376
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,120
- It was beautiful.

377
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,569
There's so many parts of,
you know, this country

378
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,863
that you just don't realize
how beautiful they are.

379
00:15:59,864 --> 00:16:00,880
- What's this?

380
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:03,149
- This is a pawn shop.
- Oh my God.

381
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,150
- All right.

382
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:10,960
- I've only ever been to L.A.
like for three days, once.

383
00:16:11,349 --> 00:16:12,300
- Really?

384
00:16:12,301 --> 00:16:13,919
- When did you take your road trip?

385
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,463
- It was five years ago.

386
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,828
We got the crosswalk.
- Okay.

387
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,199
- Yeah, and that's
actually when I met Maggie.

388
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,656
Yeah, she was my first friend out here.

389
00:16:26,657 --> 00:16:28,726
- That's amazing.
- She's cool.

390
00:16:28,727 --> 00:16:30,349
- Holy shit.
- Yeah.

391
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,489
- Yeah, love that girl.

392
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,059
I'm so sad she's not here right now.

393
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:34,980
I'm glad you're here but like,

394
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,863
I'm sad she's not here.
- It would be cool

395
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,844
to have Maggie here too.
- Yeah.

396
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:39,779
- She really brings everybody together.

397
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,613
- Yeah.

398
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:44,059
- So this place has a
really good sandwich.

399
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,559
- Nice.
- Best in L.A.

400
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,763
- Okay, I'll take your word for it.

401
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,240
But you know what I have heard?

402
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:56,389
I've heard that L.A. food is
way better than New York food.

403
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,619
- I mean, I should take
you to get like tacos

404
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,461
or poke's really good here.

405
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:03,295
- Poke?

406
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,730
Oh, poke.
- Poke, oh yeah sorry, poke.

407
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:07,389
Is it poke?
- Poke.

408
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,759
- Is it poke?
- I actually don't know,

409
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,540
I'm pulling that out of my ass.

410
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:11,449
(Emery laughing)

411
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:12,332
- But yeah, I, of course

412
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,379
went with the, you know, sandwiches.

413
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,259
- No sandwiches are
God's gift to the world.

414
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,093
I'm so happy.
- Here you go.

415
00:17:20,094 --> 00:17:21,143
- Okay, okay, thanks.

416
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:24,189
Do you mind if I smoke a cigarette?

417
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,110
- No, go for it.
- Okay.

418
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:28,128
Sorry, it's only a summer habit.

419
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,999
- It's only a summer habit?
- Yeah.

420
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,352
- That's good.
- Okay.

421
00:17:31,353 --> 00:17:32,353
Okay wait.

422
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:34,350
- I don't have a lighter on me.

423
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:36,029
- No, I got it.

424
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,749
Do you smoke?

425
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,120
- [Paul] No, I don't.

426
00:17:39,121 --> 00:17:40,170
- Good for you.

427
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:41,469
- [Paul] I got plenty other vices.

428
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,920
- [Emery] Oh yeah, like what?

429
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:46,100
(Emery laughing)

430
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:49,139
- Fuck off.
- I swear too much.

431
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,939
- Okay.
- Yeah.

432
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,843
- Yeah.
- Drink too much.

433
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,129
All the above.

434
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,939
So what brings you out here?

435
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
- To L.A?

436
00:18:02,893 --> 00:18:05,013
I don't know, like a lot of things.

437
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
Well,

438
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,409
my mom just died.
- I'm sorry about that.

439
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:19,133
- Thanks man, thanks.

440
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,169
Yeah, she was sick for a while.

441
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,979
But yeah, my mom just died

442
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,919
and then I got out of this
really bad relationship

443
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,069
with this married couple.

444
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,959
It kind of exploded and it was like weird.

445
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,939
So I needed to get away.

446
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,129
And I was like, there's just no way

447
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:43,130
that I can stay where I
am and go through another,

448
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,277
I don't know, like a year
there and I don't know.

449
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,464
Okay, that's a lot.
- I'm sorry to hear

450
00:18:50,465 --> 00:18:51,298
about your mom.
- No, thanks man, thank you.

451
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,379
I mean, I'm sorry about your mom.

452
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,679
- Yeah, thanks.

453
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,599
- And I kinda heard a
little bit about the,

454
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,429
well I saw like on your Instagram

455
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,509
that you were in a
relationship with two other.

456
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,510
- Yeah, yeah.

457
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,470
Honestly, it's crazy

458
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:05,619
because when we first started dating,

459
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,239
I was like, fuck being in a couple,

460
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,179
like throuples are where it's at,

461
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,479
like three people is great.

462
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,329
Like the communication and
it's like, you have to,

463
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,430
you're like forced to be honest, you know.

464
00:19:17,461 --> 00:19:20,099
And it was really good, until it wasn't,

465
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,799
then it was really, really bad.

466
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,313
But yeah, it just got shitty.

467
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:30,629
Mostly 'cause, you know,
I got into it for her.

468
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,257
'Cause I've been
historically gay, you know,

469
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,029
I've only dated women.

470
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:38,799
And then like I got into this thing

471
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,666
'cause she was like, "Hey, wanna date me?

472
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:46,273
"But also if you date me,
you have to date my husband."

473
00:19:46,274 --> 00:19:48,901
Anyway so we all got together

474
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:52,450
and then it turned out that me and Kace

475
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:54,789
just got along way better,

476
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,439
which was such a surprise to everyone.

477
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,269
And it kinda, it was like
all downhill from there.

478
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,429
Yeah, that was a lot.

479
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,559
That was a lot of information.

480
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,132
- No, that's, I mean, I'm
happy you shared it with me.

481
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,413
- Yeah.
- It's cool.

482
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:09,569
- Okay, what about you?

483
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:11,978
- Well I guess we'll start,

484
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,399
my parents got divorced when I was eight,

485
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,952
so they're still both alive
with different people.

486
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:21,099
I didn't mean to say it
like both, alive, I mean.

487
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,950
- No, no, it's fine, please.

488
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:28,883
- But yeah, moved out here five years ago,

489
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,839
had a thing with a girl for
about three and a half years,

490
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,840
on and off.

491
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,482
It just didn't work out.

492
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:45,789
I never felt like I was
enough with her, you know.

493
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,880
But that's, I don't know,

494
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:52,881
it's a, yeah, that one
just kinda stuck, so.

495
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,059
But Maggie's been a great
friend through it all.

496
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,722
- Yeah, yeah, she's a good one.

497
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:02,423
- And you know, like,

498
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,758
the bus comes along
every 10 minutes, right.

499
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,343
- What?

500
00:21:08,344 --> 00:21:09,559
What's the bus?

501
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,012
- I don't know, like
my mom always said that

502
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:12,659
when like you break up with somebody.

503
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,969
- There are a lot of fish in the sea.

504
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,929
- Yeah, but she just used bus analogies.

505
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:18,279
- Oh, so you're dating right now.

506
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,597
- Yeah, I mean, a little
bit like not a lot, but.

507
00:21:22,598 --> 00:21:23,431
- Yeah.

508
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,729
- Trying, you know.
- Good, good for you.

509
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,089
That's great.
- I say trying

510
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:28,790
but more or less like barely.

511
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:29,630
(Emery laughing)

512
00:21:29,631 --> 00:21:31,561
Barely doing anything with it.

513
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,796
- Okay.
- Yeah.

514
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:34,329
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

515
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,713
I mean, I have like a
dating site, but it's not.

516
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:39,643
- You own the dating site?

517
00:21:39,644 --> 00:21:41,514
- I don't own an dating site,
that's not what I meant.

518
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:46,489
But I am on one dating site.

519
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:48,649
- Cool, which one?
- The worst one.

520
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,483
(Emery laughing)

521
00:21:49,484 --> 00:21:51,659
- Okay, okay.

522
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,659
Okay, I'm gonna finish this
really quick and then we can go

523
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,079
'cause I'm really hungry.

524
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,689
- Yeah, sorry about the sandwiches,

525
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,562
but pasta will do, right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh my God,

526
00:21:58,563 --> 00:21:59,919
it's so fine, it's so fine.

527
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:00,773
I love pasta.

528
00:22:00,823 --> 00:22:01,823
I love Italian.

529
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:05,113
I'm coming in baby girl.

530
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:08,589
(cellphone pings)

531
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:12,139
- [Kace] Hey, hey, hey.
I'm just checking in

532
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,889
to see if you made it to L.A. all right.

533
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:18,026
And yeah, I'm trying to
repaint the spare bedroom

534
00:22:18,027 --> 00:22:21,440
that you originally used
to like white or eggshell

535
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:25,859
or flat white, Amber doesn't
remember, so I don't know,

536
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,793
she's not even talking to me right now.

537
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:32,529
I don't know, I think you
leaving, clarified a few things.

538
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,369
She thinks that like I pushed
you away, I don't know.

539
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,569
This is a lot, I'm sorry.

540
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,043
It's just, yeah, that West Coast gig,

541
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:41,850
I think it will pan out,

542
00:22:41,851 --> 00:22:44,203
I just need to talk to
the producer about it.

543
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,169
Got a photo shoot tomorrow.

544
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:49,809
And yeah, I'll let you know,

545
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:51,249
I'll just, yeah.

546
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,929
Let me know about that white paint,

547
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,229
is it flat or eggshell?

548
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,583
Alright, love you, talk soon, bye.

549
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,209
- Okay.

550
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:10,779
- To be honest, I'm not
much of a game player.

551
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,613
- Okay, well that's good to know

552
00:23:11,614 --> 00:23:15,983
because to be honest, I've
never made pasta before.

553
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,314
- You're first time making pasta?

554
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,679
How old are you?
- I never make it.

555
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,259
Doesn't matter.

556
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,445
I just never made it,

557
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:26,037
it was something I didn't enjoy as a kid.

558
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,509
(Emery laughing)

559
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,089
Just try it before you
judge it hard, okay.

560
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,009
- A, this is a lot of pasta

561
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,829
and B, pasta is not
supposed to look like this,

562
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,663
not supposed to do that.

563
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:37,782
- Okay. Well, when you do that,

564
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:39,289
like it doesn't look that appetizing.

565
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,085
But I'm just saying like
there's sauce in it.

566
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:46,173
- I mean, actually like
wait, do you have more sauce?

567
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,861
- This is all I have.

568
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:49,645
(Emery laughing)

569
00:23:49,695 --> 00:23:50,695
- Okay.

570
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,763
Oh my God, it's so dry.

571
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,325
- You know what don't eat it.

572
00:23:57,326 --> 00:23:58,159
I'm just kidding.

573
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,237
- No, no, no, I'm not
kidding, but like I'm kidding.

574
00:24:01,238 --> 00:24:02,829
Okay.
- Alright.

575
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,830
- I have a word.

576
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,450
I think.

577
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,529
- Wait, did you just put one back?

578
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,679
- No.
- Yes you did.

579
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,159
- No, I only have six.

580
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,249
Look, I need seven.

581
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,238
C-A-R, care bitch.
- Care, okay.

582
00:24:19,545 --> 00:24:22,014
Okay, so that's three, four, five, six.

583
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:23,139
I get six points.

584
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:26,599
- Is that what you do, you
stop at anything to win?

585
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,389
- The fuck are you talking about?

586
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,369
- [Paul] The fuck I'm talking
about, you just looked at it.

587
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,330
Yes you did.

588
00:24:32,331 --> 00:24:33,778
- Okay, okay.

589
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:38,233
Would you rather be a winner or a cheater?

590
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,009
Wait, wait, wait.
- A winner, that's a very.

591
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:45,412
- No, no, no, would you rather be a loser

592
00:24:45,413 --> 00:24:48,009
or a winner who cheats?

593
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,689
- Right now, you're both.

594
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,995
- I can't believe you
just called me a loser.

595
00:24:52,996 --> 00:24:53,904
That's so mean.

596
00:24:53,954 --> 00:24:54,787
- Well 'cause it's the first word

597
00:24:54,788 --> 00:24:56,079
and you're already going for the thing.

598
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,349
I mean, that's really ballsy.

599
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,266
It's like, wow, "Okay, I'm down early,

600
00:25:00,267 --> 00:25:02,729
"so I'm gonna go, I'm gonna double down."

601
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,939
- Okay, listen, honestly,

602
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,389
do you know how every single game ends,

603
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,709
every single board game has
ended in my entire life,

604
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,839
when I started losing, guess?

605
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,009
No, I'm just gonna tell you.

606
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,741
- [Paul] With the opponent
with the slit throat?

607
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:18,742
- No, no, I just fucking
flip the board and I scream.

608
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,529
I say like, I fucking
hate you and hate you.

609
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,589
It's really unlike me.

610
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,423
- [Paul] That's good.

611
00:25:23,424 --> 00:25:26,801
- So I feel like I don't
play games with people

612
00:25:26,802 --> 00:25:30,083
unless I've known them for
at least half of my lifetime.

613
00:25:31,002 --> 00:25:32,959
- [Paul] Then why are we
playing on the first night?

614
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,831
'Cause I feel like we gonna
get off to a very rough start.

615
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:36,740
- I know it's really bad,

616
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:38,537
it's bad already, 'cause I'm losing.

617
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:39,321
You know what?

618
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,170
I'm going to fucking flip the board.

619
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,053
Let's just do.

620
00:25:41,054 --> 00:25:43,237
Ready, one, two, three.
- Two, three.

621
00:25:43,238 --> 00:25:44,021
Fuck this game.

622
00:25:44,071 --> 00:25:45,008
- I think that's a dog.

623
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:46,042
- Is it?

624
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:48,209
That is one, which one is it?

625
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,253
You want to guess?

626
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,259
You already see Ripley's out here so.

627
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,359
- I bet it's Barkley.

628
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,356
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

629
00:25:54,357 --> 00:25:55,910
- Hey buddy.
- He's fully ready

630
00:25:55,911 --> 00:25:57,869
to go to sleep.
- He's ready to go to sleep.

631
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,549
- [Emery] Oh my God.

632
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,969
- I liked that she put up your pictures.

633
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,989
- Those are my pictures.
- They are.

634
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,668
- Yeah, wait how'd you know that?

635
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:08,993
- I recognized the car one earlier.

636
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,339
- By the map.
- Yeah.

637
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,259
No, no, no, the car one, that one.

638
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,349
- Oh yeah, yeah.
- I saw it on your Instagram.

639
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,169
- Yeah, you Instagram stalking me, Paul?

640
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,429
- No, I just want to make sure you know,

641
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:23,307
the person who's staying
with me isn't a murderer, so.

642
00:26:23,308 --> 00:26:26,889
- Yet to be seen right?
- TBD, yeah.

643
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,849
- Yeah, TBD.
- Exactly.

644
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,913
- Okay, I'm tired.

645
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,649
- I'll get these guys out of here for you.

646
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,663
- Oh fuck, I gotta take out my contacts.

647
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,943
- Alright.
- Okay, yeah.

648
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:44,882
- Okay Rip.

649
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:46,951
Okay bud.

650
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,722
All right, I'm gonna take
you in my room, okay.

651
00:26:50,723 --> 00:26:51,723
Come here buddy.

652
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Okay, ready.

653
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:01,959
Alright, I'll come back for you, Barkley.

654
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,430
All right, come on, Rip.

655
00:27:23,557 --> 00:27:26,724
(basin water running)

656
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:45,899
Goodnight.
- Night.

657
00:27:53,315 --> 00:27:56,315
(crickets chirping)

658
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:09,138
- Come on.

659
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,250
Come on.

660
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,859
Hey Maggie, good morning.

661
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,729
Your guys are on our morning walk.

662
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,730
So it's a, and your ex is here,

663
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
to be continued.

664
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,229
Hey Nick.

665
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,359
- Hey buddy, how are you?

666
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,015
Long time no see.
- Good to see you.

667
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,869
- Yeah, hey.

668
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,159
Sorry for being creepy sitting over there,

669
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,439
I was watching you with the dogs.

670
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,192
I was over at Coffee Commissary.

671
00:28:46,193 --> 00:28:47,539
- Okay.
- I was writing a script

672
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,259
and I thought, yeah, Doug, you know Doug,

673
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,999
you know Kimberly.
- Yeah, okay cool.

674
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,999
- But I just thought I'd
come over and say hi to ya.

675
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,153
- Okay, well, hey, what
are you writing about?

676
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,929
- I'm sorry, there's no script, I lied.

677
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,769
I saw that Maggie was in
New York from Instagram,

678
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,049
so I thought I'd just
come over and see if.

679
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:10,649
Listen, I got a self tape
that I need to shoot and.

680
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,479
- I've never done one, so I don't.

681
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,569
- Yeah, but I know she's
got like a setup up there

682
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:16,999
and I was wondering if
maybe we could just like,

683
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,169
help me knock one out.

684
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,770
It would take like five minutes.

685
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,949
- I mean, don't they have
the things that you can go to

686
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:23,959
and you can, I think Maggie,

687
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,399
before she had all that
stuff, she'd used that.

688
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,429
- Yes, they do, but they're like expensive

689
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:29,332
and I can't afford it right now.

690
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,339
- You can afford coffee,
but you can't get the.

691
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,479
- Well coffee's significantly cheaper.

692
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,313
I don't think you realize

693
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,929
how expensive those places are, yeah.

694
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:35,969

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,043
- Oh shit.

739
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,984
- That's okay.
- And you had it,

740
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:28,404
you dealt with this before.

741
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:30,514
- [Emery] You're talking
about your Lightroom catalog.

742
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:31,348
- My Lightroom catalog.

743
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:33,947
- [Emery] Yeah, 'Cause that
happened to me like last year.

744
00:31:33,948 --> 00:31:35,092
- I know, and I remember, I was just like,

745
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,649
don't know if I should call.

746
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,929
I don't know who to call, I mean.

747
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,423
- [Emery] Yeah, well did
you call tech support?

748
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,710
- Yeah, no.

749
00:31:43,711 --> 00:31:45,839
- Okay, so call tech support.

750
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,439
'Cause they'll just walk you through it,

751
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,329
they like take over your
computer and then I don't know,

752
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,200
walk you through stuff,

753
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:53,119
but they'll probably find
it, I'm sure it's fine.

754
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,386
- Yeah, okay.

755
00:31:54,387 --> 00:31:55,839
- [Emery] No, no, no, it's good, yeah.

756
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,209
It's totally gonna be fine.

757
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,209
It happened to me and I lost all my shit

758
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,419
'cause I don't back stuff up,

759
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,409
but you're really good
at backing stuff up, so.

760
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,479
- Yeah, it's just one of those things,

761
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,729
where you're just stupid.

762
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,630
- [Emery] It's totally good.

763
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:09,469
Okay, so call tech support,

764
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,634
let me know it happens,
but you should be fine.

765
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:13,909
- Alright cool.

766
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,482
Alright, I'll let you know how it goes.

767
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:16,483
- Okay.

768
00:32:17,512 --> 00:32:18,929
- Alright bye.
- Bye.

769
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,733
- Am I supposed to read
both Griff and Michael?

770
00:32:27,734 --> 00:32:29,319
- Yeah.
- Okay.

771
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,979
Do you want different voices or?

772
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,089
- No, same voice.

773
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:34,669
Just roll with it, you know.

774
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:35,963
- Alrighty, let's do one.

775
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,970
Whoa, this place is.

776
00:32:39,971 --> 00:32:42,749
- Oh shit, fuck, I forgot to the slate.

777
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:43,750
- What's a?

778
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:46,466
- Just keep rolling, I just
gotta like say my name and stuff

779
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:47,817
and then just keep rolling.

780
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,773
My name's Nicholas Rizzoli,
I live in Los Angeles.

781
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,153
Nicholas Rizzoli, Nicholas
Rizzoli, I live in Los Angeles.

782
00:33:01,345 --> 00:33:03,853
Nicholas Rizzoli, Los Angeles.

783
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm reading for the role of Johnny.

784
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,973
- Are we going?
- Yeah.

785
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,039
- Whoa, this place is crazy tonight.

786
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:18,609
Hey, check it out, that's the
guy I was telling you about.

787
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:21,449
Wow, look at his body,
I need a new trainer.

788
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:23,919
- Hey there buddy, didn't
think you'd actually come back.

789
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,470
- Johnny, this is Michael,
Michael, this is Johnny.

790
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,563
Don't spend it all in one place.

791
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,859
What do I get for a hundred?

792
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,126
- Depends.
- On?

793
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:38,710
- Where you put it.

794
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,945
All right scene, great.

795
00:33:41,946 --> 00:33:43,028
That was great.

796
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:43,920
That's great, yeah.

797
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:45,909
- Wanna do anymore?
- No, it's just

798
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,269
for a guest spot, you can stop rolling.

799
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,419
I mean, unless you want to do another one,

800
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,289
but I think we nailed it.

801
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,190
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

802
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:52,990
- Yeah, good job bud.
- Thanks bud.

803
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:58,919
- It's your phone.
- Let's see how this looks.

804
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,581
- Alrighty.
- That wasn't so painful.

805
00:34:00,582 --> 00:34:01,608
- Not, it was not at all.

806
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:03,579
- I think it was kind
of fun, I don't know.

807
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,009
- And I don't need this either.

808
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,382
- What?
- I don't need this either.

809
00:34:06,383 --> 00:34:07,383
- Oh.

810
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,909
You printed it.
- Bye Nick.

811
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,389
She's gonna want that back.

812
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,759
- Oh yeah, I'm going to go Joshua Tree,

813
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,650
I'm house sitting for a while,

814

What's going on?

830
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,929
- I can't come tonight, I'm so sorry,

831
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:02,860

832
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:06,089

like crystal blue eyes, Kev.

843
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,639
I'm just saying sometimes
when you're looking at him,

844
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,759

Yeah, it's good, it's good.

Wait, be more over the railing this way.

Okay.

That's nice.

862
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,059
This is good.

- So, it's cool if I go?

866
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,399
- [Emery] Yes, oh my
God, yeah, I know, sorry,

867
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,919
it's not like super exciting, but.

868
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,046
- No it was awesome, I
really liked, you know.

869
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:18,529
- [Brando] You're not
being paid for today,

870
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,363
just letting you know.

871
00:36:19,364 --> 00:36:21,510
- Okay, yeah, no, I'm
not getting money for it.

872
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,433
You're great at this.

873
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:24,423
- Have so much fun with James.
- I will.

874
00:36:24,424 --> 00:36:26,249
- And the party tonight.

875
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,083
I'm sorry, I can't make it.
- Yeah, let me know.

876
00:36:27,084 --> 00:36:28,579
- I know, okay.
- If you can make it.

877
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,549
Nice meeting you.
- Bye.

878
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,689
- See ya.
- That was fun.

879
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,670
- He's great.
- Yeah, he's a good guy.

880
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:34,029
How do you know him?

881
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,613
- He's my roommate for like a week.

882
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,281
(upbeat music)

883
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,544
- Hey James.
- What's up?

884
00:36:55,545 --> 00:36:56,609
- How are you?
- Good.

885
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,733
- Good to see ya.

886
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,619
So last time I talked to
you, was last Saturday.

887
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,453
- Yeah.

888
00:37:03,454 --> 00:37:04,939
- Did the book deal go through?

889
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,810
- Yes.
- It did.

890
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:07,091
- It did.
- There you go.

891
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:08,509
- I'm so happy.
- That's incredible.

892
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,343
- Thank God.

893
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,689
Now I just have to write the damn thing.

894
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,029
Easy part, right, we'll see.

895
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,629
Yeah, writing the whole thing is easy.

896
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,792
- Easy, when you're
not worried about rent.

897
00:37:18,793 --> 00:37:20,839
I still feel, it's been five months

898
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,339
and I still feel like
I'm paying double rent

899
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,173
after Sam moved out.

900
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,679
- Well, yeah, when you
break up with somebody,

901
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,229
that you were living with,

902
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:27,013
you're gonna have double the rent,

903
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:27,896
you had.
- All of a sudden,

904
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:29,709
your like heartbroken and poor.

905
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:32,699
It's like great, love this.

906
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,513
I just can't get used to like just.

907
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,829
- Living on your own.
- Every freaking month.

908
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:39,720
But it's fine.

909
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:42,319
So you've been dog sitting.
- Yep.

910
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,239
- A girl moved in.
- She didn't move in,

911
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,399
she's just staying with us right now.

912
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,399
Maggie's in New York right
now, so that's why she's here.

913
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,233
- Oh, gotcha.
- Yeah.

914
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,959
- Is she cool or annoying?

915
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,639
- She's really cool.

916
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,292
She's a photographer.

917
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:56,993
- Artsy.
- Yeah, exactly.

918
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,409
And yeah, we had a fun night,

919
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,110
we were playing games and eating pasta

920
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:09,109
and we just kinda, we caught up,

921
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:11,880
we got to know each other
really well and it was cool.

922
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:13,339
- Cool.
- Yeah.

923
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,190
Like we talked about stuff that like,

924
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:19,393
like it was a lot of like,

925
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:23,779
really interesting conversation.

926
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,279
It was a deeper night than
I've ever kind of really.

927
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,519
- Deeper?

928
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,829
- We just had conversations
that I just didn't expect

929
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:31,849
to have with somebody that
I just met, but it was cool.

930
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,059
- [James] Is this like a thing?

931
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,709
- It's not a thing, it's not a thing.

932
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,959
- [James] It feels like a thing.

933
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,986
I thought you were gonna be like,

934
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:39,316
"Yeah, she leaves her dishes in the sink

935
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,239
"and she got in late last night."

936
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,469
And you're like describing
her personality.

937
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:47,049
- [Paul] No, we're becoming
friends, that's it.

938
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,589
- She's sleeping like
10 feet away from you.

939
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,939
- [Paul] She's sleeping in another room.

940
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,702
- 10 feet away from you.

941
00:38:52,703 --> 00:38:55,204
(water splashing)

942
00:38:55,205 --> 00:38:57,153
I'm excited to go to this party tonight.

943
00:38:58,265 --> 00:38:59,449
- It's gonna be fun.

944
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,241
Lewis' place is always a good time.

945
00:39:01,242 --> 00:39:02,075
- I'm like I'm like ready

946
00:39:02,076 --> 00:39:03,733
to meet new people again, finally.

947
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,869
I feel like I've like reached that point

948
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:11,389
where after a breakup,
you like start to forget

949
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:14,149
how bad relationships are

950
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:19,150
and you con yourself into be
open to another one starting.

951
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,999
- Yeah, you're ready for
that next disaster to start.

952
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,861
- Right, I feel like I'm there.

953
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:25,695
(James laughing)

954
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,189
- Yeah, me too.

955
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,190
(cellphone pinging)

956
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:36,499
- Paul, I think I can
come to the party tonight,

957
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,429
so I'll see you later.

958
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,963
And also is it cool if Brando comes?

959
00:39:43,073 --> 00:39:44,229
- Just say it really fast.
- San Luis Obispo.

960
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,823
- San Luis Obispo.
- Yeah, I know where that is.

961
00:39:46,824 --> 00:39:48,773
Up in the San Luis Obispo
area, we went to this winery.

962
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:51,749
(all laughing)

963
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:52,650
- San Luis Obispo.

964
00:39:52,651 --> 00:39:53,819
- No, no, it's not the nice one.

965
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,757
It's St. Luis Obispo.
- St. Luis Obispo.

966
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:58,629
- St. Luis Obispo
- St. Luis Obispo

967
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,279
Okay.
- Oh, it's a little tight.

968
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,256
- Little tight.

969
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:04,329
Sorry, it's how we like it.

970
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,429
- Yeah, it's great.

971
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,469
- You need to get your car washed.

972
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:08,629
- [Emery] Yeah, he's got it.

973
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,463
(upbeat music)

974
00:40:09,464 --> 00:40:11,963
- Whoa.
- Thank you, heck yeah.

975
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:17,338
- Wait, wait, she's practicing,
she's allowed to practice?

976
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:18,789
- No.
- Okay, she's got it.

977
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,779
She's got it, we're so good.

978
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,727
- [Brando] All right, one, two, three.

979
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:23,762
- Go, go.
- Come one Brando,

980
00:40:23,763 --> 00:40:26,415
come on Brando, you got it.
- Okay.

981
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:27,826
Do it, you got it.

982
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:28,872
(Noelle shouting)

983
00:40:28,873 --> 00:40:30,290
- Go, go, go, go.

984
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:34,087
- Get it, get it.

985
00:40:34,088 --> 00:40:35,670
- [Lewis] Come one.

986
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,585
(all laughing)

987
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:42,969
- It really is.
- It's just fun.

988
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,069
- No it really is,

989
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,329
'cause everyone gets mean

990
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,579
and then I feel like I
wasn't athletic enough

991
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,493
and then it's a whole freaking thing.

992
00:40:48,494 --> 00:40:50,779
- Hey, hey, that was great.
- I need a second.

993
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,359
- My mom was always like stealing
stones from neighborhoods,

994
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,186
like my whole life, is
just, she's always like,

995
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,369
"Look at this rock I got."

996
00:40:57,370 --> 00:41:00,419
- Oh no, my mom stole stones too.

997
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:01,970
But from like the Grand Canyon.

998
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,889
- Okay, that's better.

999
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,723
(Emery laughing)

1000
00:41:04,724 --> 00:41:07,899
- Hey, little tip, start
shaving the back of your neck,

1001
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,699
girls don't like that shit.
- Okay.

1002
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,989
- I know you're Greek and proud of it,

1003
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,973
but you look fucking stupid.
- All right, thank you for.

1004
00:41:15,561 --> 00:41:16,450
- I do love you.

1005
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:21,450
- We had donkeys and
goats and horses and fish

1006
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,657
and we had a pet skunk.

1007
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:29,869
- He's growing up with pet skunks.

1008
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,703
- High school, yeah, okay.
- I feel like

1009
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:33,783
when I was in high school,
when I first got boobs,

1010
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:39,209
I felt like such shame, having boobs.

1011
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,563
- Yes, shame.

1012
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:44,059
Fuck man.
- But you shouldn't feel.

1013
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,056
I don't know.
- No, I know, I know.

1014
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:47,609
It's like, you look great
right now, it's totally good.

1015
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,129
- You want to shave it right now?

1016
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:50,329
- No.
- Let me shave your beard.

1017
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,099
- No, no.
- I have a straight razor,

1018
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,639
I've never used it.
- No.

1019
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,791
- Let me shave your beard, dude.

1020
00:41:54,792 --> 00:41:57,349
- I'm gonna shave it when I go home.

1021
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,330
- No, I'll shave it right now.

1022
00:41:58,331 --> 00:41:59,589
- No, I don't want you to shaving my face

1023
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,649
when you've been drinking.

1024
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:03,269
- It's not like driving.
- I know,

1025
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:05,783
but it's just my face and I don't think.

1026
00:42:05,784 --> 00:42:07,109
(Paul burping)

1027
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,943
Excuse me.

1028
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:09,289
- So we go out there and I remember,

1029
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,069
I'm in like cutoff shorts and my dad and I

1030
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,359
are trying to round up
these little skunks,

1031
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,059
we're picking them up by their tail.

1032
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,839
And when a baby skunk is like fresh,

1033
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,099
they just have no control
over their sprayer.

1034
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,579
So we're getting sprayed in the face,

1035
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,202
mist is happening, we drop them in a box

1036
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:28,029
and then my sister comes
out, spoiled little brat.

1037
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,009
Oh, got a little skunk hair on me, huh?

1038
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,647
- Sorry, I'm with you.
- Okay.

1039
00:42:32,648 --> 00:42:35,639
- But okay, just to
like circle back though,

1040
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,549
I'm right, the fire was
the first human invention.

1041
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,383
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay, yeah.

1042
00:42:39,384 --> 00:42:41,244
- I'm just like, yeah.
- We should know that.

1043
00:42:41,245 --> 00:42:42,739
- There was definitely like a fucking,

1044
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,319
like, everyone's always like,
yeah, "The man who made fire."

1045
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,872
But it was definitely a
woman don't you think?

1046
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:48,760
I think so too.

1047
00:42:48,761 --> 00:42:50,178
- Yeah, a woman discovered that shit.

1048
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:51,426
- For sure.
- For sure.

1049
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:53,703
- The guy was out being like.

1050
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:55,739
- Yeah, fucking lazy or whatever.

1051
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,149
- Kill something.
- Yeah, aggressive,

1052
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,289
aggressive or lazy that feels correct.

1053
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:04,547
- And she was like,
hold on a sec, hold on,

1054
00:43:04,548 --> 00:43:06,592
I'm gonna make fire.
- Yeah, yeah.

1055
00:43:06,593 --> 00:43:09,343
(Emery laughing)

1056
00:43:14,806 --> 00:43:15,639
- Should we get more liquor?

1057
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,509
I feel like we're
running out of what beer,

1058
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,149
fast.
- Yes, yeah, yeah.

1059
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:19,983
Yeah, let's do it.

1060
00:43:19,984 --> 00:43:22,269
Let's just go to the bodega.

1061
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,103
- Leave the fire, fuck it.

1062
00:43:23,104 --> 00:43:24,659
- Yeah, yeah, fuck it, it's fine.

1063
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,460
It's totally good, everybody's here.

1064
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,138
- What are you doing?

1065
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:31,859
Why are you in the city?

1066
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,509
Go away, you have a family now.

1067
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,987
- They pay you rent.
- Yeah, so.

1068
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,483
Get outta here, get outta here.

1069
00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:45,199
They call me, they always want stuff.

1070
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,469
- That's, I mean.

1071
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:50,149
- Like this one tenant keeps
complaining about his heater.

1072
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,990
- It's cold.

1073
00:43:50,991 --> 00:43:54,399
- It's fucking Southern
California, it's not cold.

1074
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,109
- I mean, just fix the
heat, it's your job.

1075
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:59,419
- Go somewhere warm if you wanna be warm.

1076
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,218
If you want to be cold,

1077
00:44:01,219 --> 00:44:02,869
go somewhere, go to Minnesota.

1078
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,448
- They don't want to be cold.

1079
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:06,219
- Why do they have to call me,

1080
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,459
call your mom or something.

1081
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,626
- They're calling you because you're.

1082
00:44:09,627 --> 00:44:10,710
- For warmth.

1083
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:17,089
- Trying to spray him, you
know, give them a little scare.

1084
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:17,923
It thought it was like running the house,

1085
00:44:17,924 --> 00:44:20,399
and then it would jump up on the couch

1086
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,817
and it would lay on its back
and look into your eyes.

1087
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,553
- And that's when you knew you were gay.

1088
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:31,663
- When I knew I was what?

1089
00:44:31,664 --> 00:44:33,714
- Gay.
- Oh gay.

1090
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:35,466
(James laughing)

1091
00:44:35,467 --> 00:44:38,588
(basin water running)

1092
00:44:38,589 --> 00:44:41,839
(music plays)

1093
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:49,807
(music plays)

1094
00:44:49,808 --> 00:44:52,533
(Brando laughing)

1095
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:03,262
(cellphone ringing)

1096
00:45:14,020 --> 00:45:15,310
- [Emery] Hi, you've reached.

1097
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:18,478
(car engines revving)

1098
00:45:25,508 --> 00:45:28,508
(crickets chirping)

1099
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,477
(car engine revving)

1100
00:45:51,093 --> 00:45:53,193
- [Commentator] 107 yards and a touchdown.

1101
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,332
Once again from the gun, fake,

1102
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,699
Mahomes at side on
delivered, as Sammy Watkins.

1103
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,108
Ball pops free at the
end, Ravens came sliding.

1104
00:46:03,109 --> 00:46:07,079
- Hey.
- Hey, what's happening?

1105
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:08,403
- Nothing, you?

1106
00:46:10,258 --> 00:46:11,173
- Nada.

1107
00:46:11,174 --> 00:46:13,379
- [Commentator] Back at the 49.

1108
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:14,619
Wide receiver set

1109
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,419
but they'll run Ingram on the outside.

1110
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,123
Busting through, Ingram
stumbles across the 40.

1111
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,939
[Commentator] Third and five,
Jackson, over the middle,

1112
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,809
Jackson connects Mark Andrews.

1113
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,223
Third and 10, Baltimore will go empty.

1114
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:34,190
[Commentator] Jackson.

1115
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,835
- What you watching?

1116
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,759
- [Paul] Some sports highlights.

1117
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,413
- [Commentator] Keeps the play alive.

1118
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,074
[Commentator] Jackson
stumbles across the 10.

1119
00:46:43,075 --> 00:46:45,158
- Sure, thank you.
- Okay.

1120
00:46:47,088 --> 00:46:49,586
You good?

00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,013
I just, tried to call you.

1123
00:46:53,014 --> 00:46:54,877
- I know, my phone died.

1124
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:57,390
- No, no, it's cool.
- I'm so sorry.

1125
00:46:57,391 --> 00:46:58,294
- I just didn't know where you went,

1126
00:46:58,295 --> 00:46:59,499
I was like, I'm gonna head out.

1127
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,579
- No, Noelle and I went to go grab beer

1128
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,609
and then we got sidetracked,

1129
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:06,359
we just like walked our blocks and sorry.

1130
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,799
- [Paul] No, no, hey, it doesn't matter.

1131
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,420

- No, it's nice that you're
like keeping tabs on me, dad.

1134
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,499
- I'm not your dad, no.

1135
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,109
- You're not my dad, that's true.

1136
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,740
No, but seriously, I'm
sorry, that was rude of me,

Okay, I have questions
that I like to ask people.

00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:47,433
- Okay.
- You ready?

1149
00:47:47,483 --> 00:47:48,316
- Sure.

1150
00:47:48,317 --> 00:47:50,453
- Okay, my favorite
question to ask people is,

1151
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:55,649
what is your favorite, your
personal favorite compliment,

1152
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:58,149
you've ever received to your face?

1153
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:59,249
Okay, it's a two part question.

1154
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,083
- Do I need to write it down?

1155
00:48:00,084 --> 00:48:01,369
- No, no, no, it's gonna be good.

1156
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:04,129
Okay, what is your personal
favorite compliment

1157
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:07,019
that you've ever received to your face

1158
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,799
and also behind your back?

1159
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,839
Meaning like you heard
it through the grape vine

1160
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,019
that somebody said something
really nice about you.

1161
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,039
- To my face, the nicest
thing someone said about me?

1162
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,269
- Yeah.

1163
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,793
No, not the nicest, like your
personal favorite compliment?

1164
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:24,800
- The nicest thing someone said about me?

1165
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:32,599
To my face, that I was thoughtful.

1166
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,789
- Well, that's nice.

1167
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:35,003
That's nice.
- Yeah.

1168
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,803
- Behind my back.
- Yeah.

1169
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,289
That's a tough one.
- Okay, yeah.

1170
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,329
I'll tell you mine so that

1171
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:45,966
it'll like spark something, right.

1172
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,669
- Yeah, that'll help.
- Okay, okay.

1173
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,039
'Cause I don't know my
actual to my face compliment,

1174
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,919
but my behind my back compliment is that,

1175
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,809
two of my friends were talking
about me on the phone once,

1176
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:58,889
I heard it, because one
of my friends told me,

1177
00:48:58,890 --> 00:48:59,887
and they were like,

1178
00:48:59,888 --> 00:49:02,539
"I wonder what Emery is doing right now."

1179
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:05,409
And they both were like, this
is how they said it went,

1180
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,399
they both got like
really quiet for a second

1181
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,369
and then at the same time were like,

1182
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:12,459
I bet she's doing whatever she wants.

1183
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,196
And I was like, fuck, that's such a good,

1184
00:49:15,197 --> 00:49:18,759
that's my favorite thing that
anyone's ever said about me.

1185
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,556
I am like, put that on
my tombstone, you know,

1186
00:49:20,557 --> 00:49:23,789
"Here lies Emery, died
doing whatever she wanted."

1187
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:25,929
- No one has ever said
that cool thing about me.

1188
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:27,579
That's for sure.

1189
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,669
Never.
- That's okay.

1190
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,370
- Like I was gonna say like
that I'm a good boyfriend.

1191
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:34,863
That's pathetic.

1192
00:49:34,864 --> 00:49:37,689
That's puts it to shame compared to yours.

1193
00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:39,069
- [Emery] It's great
to be a good boyfriend.

1194
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:41,363
- God, "Here lies Emery, just fucking

1195
00:49:41,364 --> 00:49:44,326
"enjoyed the shit out of her life.

1196
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:46,528
"And then Paul, he was an okay guy."

1197
00:49:46,529 --> 00:49:48,856
- [Emery] I heard that you
were a great boyfriend.

1198
00:49:48,857 --> 00:49:51,436
- Yeah, "I heard you
were a great boyfriend,

1199
00:49:51,437 --> 00:49:54,179
"too bad you died from a
self-inflicted gunshot wound."

1200
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,291
Just kidding, just kidding.
- Whoa.

1201
00:49:56,292 --> 00:49:57,669
- I know, God sorry.

1202
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,969
- That got real dark, real fast.

1203
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:01,719
- Sorry, are you hungry?
- Yes.

1204
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,799
- Wait, do we have it?

1205
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,449
- [Emery] I just assumed you
said, "No, we don't have it."

1206
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:06,569
But I said son of a bitch

1207
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,619
at the same time you said something.

1208
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:10,720
- No, we don't have it.
- Son of a bitch.

1209
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,359
Yeah, we didn't go grocery shopping.

1210
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:16,525
- [Paul] Have you ever had cold pizza?

1211
00:50:16,526 --> 00:50:20,676
- You're just, fuck it like,
"Yeah, eat some cold pizza

1212
00:50:20,677 --> 00:50:22,780
"cause I don't wanna cook this shit up."

1213
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:24,238
- Right, I don't.

1214
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:27,069
- No, that's good, that's
good, it's fine, it's late.

1215
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:30,089
Cold pizza is actually,
it's Chinese food and pizza,

1216
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:32,489
the two things that are
just maybe better cold

1217
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:34,269
than they are not cold.

1218
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:36,629
Okay, you ask a question now.

1219
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,083
- Okay, my question.

1220
00:50:39,584 --> 00:50:41,393
Are you a virgin?
- Am I a virgin?

1221
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,749
If I said yes, would you believe me?

1222
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,059
- I'd be worried, but I would believe you

1223
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,379
because you're honest.

1224
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,777
- I'm like clocking if
that was a compliment.

1225
00:50:48,778 --> 00:50:50,469
Wait, that took me a second.

1226
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,729
- It's a compliment.
- It is?

1227
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:52,879
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1228
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,499
Yes, no, no I'm not a virgin,
I'm 33, what the fuck?

1229
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,048
- Good.
- Are you a virgin?

1230
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:03,532
- No, but my virginity
story, like, I mean.

1231
00:51:03,533 --> 00:51:05,423
- Okay, well now you have to tell.

1232
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:12,243
- Okay, I was working a summer job

1233
00:51:12,244 --> 00:51:17,244
at Eagle's Nest Country Club,
I was working the snack bar,

1234
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,890
and there was a really
pretty girl, Jordy Bollinger.

1235
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,149
- Wow, what a name.

1236
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,769
- Right, she was a swim
instructor at the pool.

1237
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:26,716
- Whoa, sexy.
- Yeah.

1238
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,679
- Really hot.

1239
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:31,899
- It was a 4th of July party
and we were having a lot of fun

1240
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:36,900
and yeah, we, you know, had sex

1241
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,029
for about like 10 minutes or so I think.

1242
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:41,910
- What?

1243
00:51:41,911 --> 00:51:44,499
Oh my, okay, sorry, I'm
listening, I'm listening.

1244
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,500
- It's okay.

1245
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:48,839
Then I went home and I was
like smiling in my bed.

1246
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,299
Like, you know, like, oh
it happened or whatever.

1247
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,489
And then like the next day I went to work

1248
00:51:52,490 --> 00:51:56,179
and all my buddies from work
are laughing when I walk in

1249
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,452
and I found out that she had sex

1250
00:51:58,453 --> 00:52:00,349
with a guy right after I left.

1251
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:01,999
- What?
- Yeah.

1252
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,599
- Oh man.

1253
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,752
Wait so she had sex with you at a party

1254
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:09,629
and then you left and she
had sex with another guy.

1255
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,289
- Yeah, it's nice when you repeat it too,

1256
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:12,739
it makes me feel really good about it.

1257
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,163
- Sorry dude, oh my God.
- It's okay.

1258
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:17,799
- I'm just making sure I
have the facts straight.

1259
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,250
- No, it's good, I mean, like

1260
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,029
it's probably where it
all started with like,

1261
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:26,509
not like feeling like
I'm enough, you know.

1262
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:30,552
- Oh shit, shit, yeah, sorry.

1263
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:33,037
- [Paul] It's okay, these things happen.

1264
00:52:33,038 --> 00:52:35,433
- No, that's real.
- Yeah.

1265
00:52:38,915 --> 00:52:41,849
Did you lose your virginity
to a guy or a girl?

1266
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:43,199
- Whoa, blunt.

1267
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,137
I'm just kidding, I'm an open book.

1268
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:45,303
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

1269
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:49,123
I had sex with a guy first,

1270
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,449
only one guy ever my entire
like twenties, early thirties,

1271
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,733
and then I met Kace and
he was the only other guy.

1272
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,305
Okay, so I had sex when I was in college.

1273
00:53:02,306 --> 00:53:03,190
- Okay.

1274
00:53:03,191 --> 00:53:04,622
- So not so young, yeah.

1275
00:53:04,623 --> 00:53:05,859
- [Paul] Probably a bit smarter to wait.

1276
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:07,749
- Well, I had sex with this guy

1277
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:11,099
and then after that I had
just had sex with women

1278
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:13,169
for like the next decade.

1279
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:14,569
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1280
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:15,699
I told him that actually,

1281
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:17,069
and he was like, "Fuck, was it me?"

1282
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,626
- I would think that too.

1283
00:53:18,627 --> 00:53:19,460
- You would think.

1284
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:20,715
You would think like,
"Shit, I really fucked it."

1285
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:21,716
- I fucked it up.

1286
00:53:22,543 --> 00:53:24,279
- [Emery] God, that's so self absorbed.

1287
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,639
- It's okay, I know, men.

1288
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,089
- Selfish.
- I know.

1289
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:29,909
- Yeah, how dare you take
away my queerness, you know.

1290
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,653
You ever had sex with a guy?

1291
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:34,419
- I have not, no.

1292
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:35,609
- You ever make out with a guy?

1293
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,629
- No, that's not been on my.

1294
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,479
- Just a little butt stuff.

1295
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,123
- No butt stuff, I mean.

1296
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:44,799
I have to think, am I?

1297
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,760
- No.
- No.

1298
00:53:45,761 --> 00:53:46,874
No butt stuff.
- No butt stuff.

1299
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,459
- No butt stuff.

1300
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:50,009
Not yet, but.

1301
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:52,039
- Oh, I like that you're
open to it though.

1302
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,157
- Yeah, not really.

1303
00:53:54,158 --> 00:53:56,579
(both laughing)

1304
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:59,119
- I get excited when
men are like, you know,

1305
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:00,259
open to stuff.
- I'm in to butt stuff then,

1306
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:02,059
yeah, for sure.
- Shut the fuck up.

1307
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,219
- Yeah, I'm definitely into butt stuff.

1308
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:06,019
- Yeah, let's let's do
butt stuff right now.

1309
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,302
- Okay, don't make it weird.

1310
00:54:07,303 --> 00:54:08,336
- Sorry.

1311
00:54:08,337 --> 00:54:11,243
(both laughing)

1312
00:54:11,244 --> 00:54:14,244
(sizzling)

1313
00:54:19,705 --> 00:54:24,241
- Oh, okay yeah.

1314
00:54:24,242 --> 00:54:25,242
Cool.

1315
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:35,400
- Morning.

1316
00:54:36,632 --> 00:54:39,403
Night shoots are killing me.

1317
00:54:40,722 --> 00:54:42,403
And there's this one sound guy,

1318
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,942
he's like a little too handsy, you know.

1319
00:54:46,943 --> 00:54:49,063
It's like, read the year.

1320
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,619
So, just an idea and no pressure,

1321
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,783
but you should take Emery to the beach,

1322
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,416
she loves the beach,
it'll be good for you.

1323
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:04,803
The ocean's like really, you
know, cleansing and stuff.

1324
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,260
Okay.

1325
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:12,290
Love you, bye.

1326
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,656
- She's doing good.
- Bye.

1327
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:26,769
You think that security
camera outside actually works?

1328
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:27,603
- No.

1329
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:29,159
She put it up there as a fake.

1330
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:29,943
- Oh my God.

1331
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:30,910
I kinda wish it worked,

1332
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,409
I was out there like picking my nose

1333
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:35,534
and like look up, it's like
this red thing beeping at me.

1334
00:55:35,535 --> 00:55:37,339
- You wanna know like who's watching that?

1335
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:38,779
- Is this for me?

1336
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,630
- That's for you, yeah.
- Thank you.

1337
00:55:41,824 --> 00:55:43,469
Good, nice.

1338
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:44,470
- Believe it or not,

1339
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:46,670
no salt or pepper.

1340
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:50,012
- Yeah, believe it.

1341
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,349
It's good though.

1342
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:52,746
Better than your pasta.

1343
00:55:52,747 --> 00:55:53,749
(Emery laughing)

1344
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,689
No, no, it's good, it's good.
- Cool.

1345
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:59,359
I was thinking, you wanna
go to the beach today?

1346
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,379
- Yeah, yeah, I have some work to do,

1347
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,523
but then I would love to.
- Okay.

1348
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,620
- Is that what you're
gonna wear to the beach.

1349
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:11,879
No, I'm not, I'm not like.
- I was thinking about it.

1350
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,519
- I'm just thinking that
if we go to the beach,

1351
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,809
I'll bring my camera,

1352
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:17,059
and if I bring my camera

1353
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,359
and you're the only person
I'm with at the beach,

1354
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:20,609
you're probably gonna end up in photos.

1355
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:21,617
- You're gonna take pictures of me today.

1356
00:56:21,618 --> 00:56:23,420
- [Emery] Yeah, yeah.

1357
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:27,010
(music plays)

1358
00:56:32,004 --> 00:56:33,572
- Yeah, that's it.

1359
00:56:33,573 --> 00:56:35,249
- I think the last photo I took was with.

1360
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:37,139
- Don't talk while I'm taking photos

1361
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,240
your mouth is gonna be moving all over.

1362
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:39,074
- I've never taken pictures.

1363
00:56:39,075 --> 00:56:41,179
- No, no, no, it's okay,
just try it one more time,

1364
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,020
just no talking.

1365
00:56:42,021 --> 00:56:43,532
- Sorry, I'm trying to figure
out how to do like the whole.

1366
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,016
- Oh my God, you're still
talking while I'm taking shots.

1367
00:56:46,017 --> 00:56:47,773
- I'm sorry.
- Just stop.

1368
00:56:47,774 --> 00:56:49,100
No, no, no, it's fine.

1369
00:56:49,101 --> 00:56:50,657
- Okay, all right, okay.
- It's fucking good.

1370
00:56:50,658 --> 00:56:51,689
- Am I knocking it out of the park?

1371
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:52,560
- Yeah, yeah.
- Here we go.

1372
00:56:52,561 --> 00:56:55,369
- Okay, once more other hand.
- Okay, two hands?

1373
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,099
- [Emery] Yeah, I fucking love surfing.

1374
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:59,169
- Me too, I freaking.
- Yeah, you surf?

1375
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,649
- Not at all.
- I don't surf either.

1376
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:02,483
- [Paul] I want to,

1377
00:57:02,484 --> 00:57:05,079
but I've just never have
had the balls to do it.

1378
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,179
- Dude, we should take a surfing lesson.

1379
00:57:07,180 --> 00:57:09,309
- You tell me the day and
I'm there in a heartbeat.

1380
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:10,869
- Really?
- Yes, I want to do it.

1381
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:12,829
I'm waiting for somebody to do it with me

1382
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:15,779
so that I can actually
drive down the PCH to do it.

1383
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,479
- I think surfing is one of those things

1384
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,282
that I feel like I would be really good at

1385
00:57:19,283 --> 00:57:22,053
and then it'll be really
hard and I might suck.

1386
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:25,319
- [Paul] I feel like I would be terrible.

1387
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,139
- See that's good, you
set the bar really low.

1388
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,839
I should have that perspective

1389
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,939
where I'm like, I'm
going to go in sucking,

1390
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:33,049
and then if I do anything other than suck,

1391
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,819
I'll feel really great about myself.

1392
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,469
- Yeah, I'm afraid I'm gonna fail,

1393
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:38,027
so I never do it at all.

1394
00:57:38,028 --> 00:57:39,229
(Emery laughing)

1395
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,729
- We both just said the same thing,

1396
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,719
I just said suck and he said fail.

1397
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:45,069
- Yeah, but.
- We both have the same fear.

1398
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:47,009
- But you would actually do it.

1399
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:49,859
Me, I'm like chicken shit,
I'm like, I'm not gonna do it.

1400
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:50,889
- Yeah, well you're doing it with me,

1401
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:51,949
'cause we're gonna take a lesson.

1402
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:52,950
- All right, fine.

1403
00:57:53,825 --> 00:57:55,067
- Oh, pinky swearing.

1404
00:57:55,068 --> 00:57:56,821
- [Paul] Now, we're
gonna do this then we go.

1405
00:57:56,822 --> 00:57:57,822
- No.

1406
00:58:00,895 --> 00:58:01,802
Now you spit.

1407
00:58:01,803 --> 00:58:03,052
- Wacha!
- What?

1408
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:04,964
- [Paul] What, do you spit?

1409
00:58:04,965 --> 00:58:06,586
- What do you, wacha?

1410
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:09,541
Okay, no, do it again, pinky swear.

1411
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:11,719
- Wacha!
- I'm not gonna say that.

1412
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,457
- Okay, deal.
- Okay.

1413
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:14,819
Wacha.

1414
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,276
- Now you said it, there you go.

1415
00:58:16,277 --> 00:58:17,060
"I'm not gonna say it,

1416
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:17,893
"there's no way I'm gonna say it."

1417
00:58:17,943 --> 00:58:18,920
And then you say it.

1418
00:58:18,921 --> 00:58:20,173
- What the fuck?

1419
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:22,619
- What the fuck is that?

1420
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,630
- [Emery] That is a family of Segways.

1421
00:58:23,631 --> 00:58:24,947
- Jesus Christ.

1422
00:58:24,948 --> 00:58:26,409
(Emery laughing)

1423
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:28,066
When a family does that, that's like,

1424
00:58:28,067 --> 00:58:29,699
"Hey, we're a bunch of
nerds, we're the nerds."

1425
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,620
You know what I mean?

1426
00:58:30,621 --> 00:58:31,719
- [Emery] Are they nerds
or are they the coolest.

1427
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:32,879
- They might be the coolest in the world.

1428
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,342
- Among us.
- You're right.

1429
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:35,330
(Emery laughing)

1430
00:58:35,331 --> 00:58:37,149
- [Emery] I don't know, I mean, maybe.

1431
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:38,600
- I mean, you're really cool.

1432
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,869
- I am cool.
- You're the coolest.

1433
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,901
- No, no, you're cool.
- No, you're cool.

1434
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:43,902
- No, no.

1435
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:46,822
Let's not do that.
- Okay.

1436
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,663
But you know, you're cool, right?

1437
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,013
- Yeah.

1438
00:58:53,014 --> 00:58:54,959
- You are the definition of cool.

1439
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,109
You take pictures, you charge
people millions of dollars

1440
00:58:58,110 --> 00:58:59,323
and you live on a couch.

1441
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,899
That's pretty cool.

1442
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:03,366
What is that?

1443
00:59:03,367 --> 00:59:05,113
I'm gonna have glitter now.

1444
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,897
You're gonna ruin the
shoot, are you kidding me?

1445
00:59:07,898 --> 00:59:09,429
(Emery laughing)

1446
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:11,749
Everyone's gonna think
I'm a fairy godmother.

1447
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:13,539
- [Emery] Well now you're cool too.

1448
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:14,373
- Now I'm cool.

1449
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:16,299
- [Emery] It's just the
glitter that makes me cool.

1450
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,603
I take it off and I'm just a fucking nerd.

1451
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,919
- No it's still on and you look,

1452
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,982
even when it's off, I'm sure you're cool.

1453
00:59:26,983 --> 00:59:28,269
(cellphone ringing)

1454
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:30,114
Is your phone ringing?

1455
00:59:30,115 --> 00:59:32,615
- Shit, hang on.
- What do you got?

1456
00:59:33,694 --> 00:59:34,772
- It's Noelle.

1457
00:59:34,773 --> 00:59:36,873
- [Paul] I don't even have her number yet.

1458
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:41,099
- Noelle Party, is her and my phone.

1459
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,222
- Noelle Coworker.

1460
00:59:42,223 --> 00:59:44,294
(Emery laughing)

1461
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:47,500
- [Noelle] Hey.

1462
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:48,415
- [Emery] What the fuck is she eating?

1463
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:51,029
- [Noelle] Last night was so much fun.

1464
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,965
I'm wondering if you guys wanna hang out.

1465
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:56,589
- She wants to hang
out, you wanna hang out?

1466
00:59:56,590 --> 00:59:58,849
- [Paul] Yeah, let's hang out.

1467
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,459
- Cool, do you know where she lives?

1468
01:00:00,460 --> 01:00:02,009
- I don't know where she
lives, I don't have her number,

1469
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:04,059
I have no idea.
- Okay cool.

1470
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:05,425
What's your address?

1471
01:00:05,426 --> 01:00:06,853
(birds chirping)

1472
01:00:06,854 --> 01:00:07,687
(gentle upbeat music)

1473
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,789
- Hey, yo.
- Hey.

1474
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:10,853
- [Paul] There she is.

1475
01:00:10,854 --> 01:00:12,823
- Hello friends.
- In overalls.

1476
01:00:13,738 --> 01:00:15,579
- I know, I'm like a little farmer girl.

1477
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,130
- Yeah.
- Right, looking good.

1478
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:20,660
- How's it going, guys?
- Hey.

1479
01:00:22,015 --> 01:00:23,115
- Okay, are you ready?

1480
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,213
Let's hit the road.
- Okay.

1481
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,019
You gotta watch out for that guy.

1482
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:31,420
- Let's go.
- How was your day?

1483
01:00:31,421 --> 01:00:32,254
- Good.
- You didn't work today?

1484
01:00:32,255 --> 01:00:33,359
- I had work today.
- Oh you did?

1485
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,239
- No, I did.
- Oh, okay.

1486
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:36,569
- [Emery] Oh yeah, you guys work together.

1487
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:38,159
- It's sad without Paul there.

1488
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,319
- [Paul] I know.

1489
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,949
- [Emery] Can't be that sad.

1490
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,816
- Yeah, it really can not be that sad.

1491
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:44,589
It's your third day, you kidding me?

1492
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,559
You're freaking expert now.

1493
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,052
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1494
01:00:49,053 --> 01:00:49,960
(Emery laughing)

1495
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,010
- [Emery] Okay.

1496
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,979
- [Paul] Did you pick today or did you?

1497
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:59,219
- I did a little, I feel
like we were super slow.

1498
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,469
So I did a lot of like Mark was,

1499
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:05,089
I did more picking than
I thought I was going to.

1500
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:06,219
- [Paul] Okay.

1501
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,670
- What are you talking about?

1502
01:01:09,881 --> 01:01:12,723
- Okay, and we're in.
- Okay.

1503
01:01:13,683 --> 01:01:17,763
- It's your local liquor.
- Local liquor.

1504
01:01:17,764 --> 01:01:20,619
- Oh, I forgot my wallet.
- I got some cash.

1505
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:21,729
- You do.
- We got ya.

1506
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,919
- Okay amazing.
- My treat.

1507
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,699
- [Paul] We work at the
warehouse, we're good.

1508
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,586
- [Emery] Whatever, I can Venmo you guys.

1509
01:01:25,587 --> 01:01:27,819
- [Noel] We're gonna spoil you.

1510
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:29,272
- Okay.
- Oh.

1511
01:01:29,273 --> 01:01:30,106
- Here we go.
- Hi.

1512
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:31,177
- Hey guys.

1513
01:01:33,324 --> 01:01:35,129
- Hello.
- Met these guys yet?

1514
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,194
- Theo, Ripley and Barkley's coming up.

1515
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:38,195
- Hi.
- Hi.

1516
01:01:42,223 --> 01:01:45,759
- Oh my God, I love them.
- They're big fans.

1517
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,129
Before I put the food out,

1518
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,712
I'll put them away.
- Okay.

1519
01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:51,166
- 'Cause I don't want
them eating anything.

1520
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,164
Come here, come here.

1521
01:01:53,165 --> 01:01:57,079
- [Noelle] Are you guys
gonna jump on the table.

1522
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,247
- [Emery] Yes.

1523
01:01:59,447 --> 01:02:01,149
- Oh my God.
- Hey guys.

1524
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,489
No fighting, no fighting.

1525
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:03,330
Come on, come on.

1526
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,213
Treat, treat.

1527
01:02:04,214 --> 01:02:06,294
Come on, treat.

1528
01:02:06,295 --> 01:02:07,689
Treat, treat, treat, treat, treat.

1529
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,287
- Barkley's like, I don't.

1530
01:02:09,288 --> 01:02:10,819
He doesn't trust it.

1531
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,289
Here, I got him, I got him.

1532
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:13,783
He doesn't trust it.

1533
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:17,379
- He's like, "I wanna
stay with the women."

1534
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,437
I love video games.

1535
01:02:19,438 --> 01:02:22,749
I feel like I'm not good at the ones

1536
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:23,999
that go like this though.

1537
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,759
Like the ones where you
have to like move your head.

1538
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,919
There's like two controllers.

1539
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:29,920
Here we go.

1540
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:32,313
Here we go.

1541
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:36,499
And here we go.
- There is.

1542
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:38,150
- This is what I'm talking about.

1543
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:42,629
My head has to move first,

1544
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,159
my gun second.

1545
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,341
Bam, gotcha.

1546
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:46,175
(virtual gun firing)

1547
01:02:46,176 --> 01:02:47,313
Double bam.

1548
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:51,887
Flaming trash cans.
- Oh my God.

1549
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,060
You're good at this.

1550
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:54,943
- Am I good?

1551
01:02:54,944 --> 01:02:56,793
Or is this the beginner round?

1552
01:02:58,170 --> 01:02:59,549
Some zombies are gonna
start shooting at me

1553
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:00,929
while I have to get this.

1554
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:03,289
But then at that point I
won't be able to manage

1555
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,293
'cause my neck will have to move,

1556
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,021
before I started running.

1557
01:03:08,022 --> 01:03:08,855
(all laughing)

1558
01:03:08,856 --> 01:03:10,899
I feel like no one knows
what I'm talking about.

1559
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:14,009
- No, I can see the quick jolts
that you're talking about.

1560
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:15,582
- Neck move, neck move.

1561
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,379
(Emery laughing)

1562
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:20,083
Do you have any games
that are just one button?

1563
01:03:21,281 --> 01:03:22,779
Are you gonna get that yellow thing?

1564
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:23,613
No.
- No.

1565
01:03:23,614 --> 01:03:25,008
Out of the way.
- Just the pink things,

1566
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:25,842
are you going for?
- Oh my God.

1567
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:27,307
- Well, I think they're called moons.

1568
01:03:27,308 --> 01:03:28,965
- Definitely not a moon.
- Yes it is.

1569
01:03:28,966 --> 01:03:31,319
- No, those are asteroids.
- No, those are moons.

1570
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,503
- Definitely asteroids.

1571
01:03:33,460 --> 01:03:35,036
Do you know what the
definition of a moon is?

1572
01:03:35,037 --> 01:03:37,629
- The thing that comes out at night.

1573
01:03:37,630 --> 01:03:38,540
What?

1574
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,423
Isn't that what it is?

1575
01:03:39,424 --> 01:03:41,669
- Wait, give me your actual definition

1576
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:44,162
of what you think a moon is.

1577
01:03:44,163 --> 01:03:45,439
(all laughing)

1578
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,455
- [Paul] The thing that
comes out at night.

1579
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:49,088
- [Noelle] The thing
that comes out at night.

1580
01:03:49,089 --> 01:03:49,922
- Yeah.
- No, it's always there.

1581
01:03:49,923 --> 01:03:52,519
- [Paul] Look in the
dictionary, that's what it says.

1582
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,389
- It's always there, actually.

1583
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:56,009
- I thought you're going to be more hippy

1584
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,849
and be like the thing that like

1585
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,609
makes women get their periods.

1586
01:03:59,610 --> 01:04:03,829
- The thing that everyone's
horoscope is all about, right?

1587
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:05,669
- That's just like planets.
- Yeah.

1588
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,849
- No, it's just.
- Each time he says

1589
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:09,449
his own definition of a moon.

1590
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:11,213
It's as far away as possible.

1591
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,629
(Emery laughing)

1592
01:04:12,630 --> 01:04:13,842
- [Paul] Is it?

1593
01:04:13,843 --> 01:04:15,779
- Noelle and I are on the same page,

1594
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,864
I don't know where you at?

1595
01:04:16,865 --> 01:04:18,908
- Okay, well you guys are on page 67

1596
01:04:18,909 --> 01:04:20,299
and I'm already going
towards the end of the book.

1597
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,269
- Honestly, okay, we
gotta watch the movie,

1598
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,029
I seriously can't play this game anymore.

1599
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:25,645
- This is a game from the '80s.

1600
01:04:25,646 --> 01:04:27,169
- [Paul] Yeah.

1601
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,049
- This is one of those things where,

1602
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:32,289
I used to play this game on
my computer all the time.

1603
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,763
That an Oregon Trail.

1604
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,003
- I gotta check on the dogs,
think they need to pee.

1605
01:04:42,710 --> 01:04:44,193
Hey guys, how we doing?

1606
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,440
You good?

1607
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,840
Okay.

1608
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:53,030
(sniffs) Oh.

1609
01:04:56,531 --> 01:04:57,531
All right guys.

1610
01:04:58,843 --> 01:05:02,193
- Oh my God, I'm so tired.
- Yeah.

1611
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:07,869
- It's like that time of night

1612
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:11,694
where you're like, oh no, I
have to like do the thing,

1613
01:05:11,695 --> 01:05:16,110
or I have to call an Uber and
like go outside in the cold

1614
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,653
and wait to go home.

1615
01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:24,683
- [Emery] You can crash here.

1616
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,469
Yeah, totally.

1617
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:29,809
I have like the smallest bed in the world.

1618
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:32,809
It's literally like a futon,
that's like this small,

1619
01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:37,239
like ideally I had Paul's
bed, he's got a king size,

1620
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,640
but you're welcome to crash.

1621
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,099
- I feel like that seems intense.

1622
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,066
I'm like, hey, I met you yesterday.

1623
01:05:44,067 --> 01:05:45,279
- No, no, it's fine.

1624
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,439
- Can I sleep in your
extremely small futon?

1625
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,783
- It's fine.

1626
01:06:00,754 --> 01:06:03,143
How many piercings do you have?

1627
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,839
- Just two, two in each ear.

1628
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,999
- Two on either side?
- Yeah.

1629
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,183
- That's it.

1630
01:06:09,184 --> 01:06:11,942
- It's not really impressive.
- No, no, it's great.

1631
01:06:11,943 --> 01:06:13,793
I got my nose and my ears.

1632
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,193
I used to want to have my whole, like.

1633
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,389
- Not interested.

1634
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:22,223
You didn't want it in?

1635
01:06:22,224 --> 01:06:24,439
- No, I just like never
got around to doing it.

1636
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:25,969
- You should get a second
one, it's really fun,

1637
01:06:25,970 --> 01:06:30,833
you can put like two
different earrings in it.

1638
01:06:39,382 --> 01:06:40,482
Where'd you get this glitter?

1639
01:06:40,483 --> 01:06:42,439
I've never seen glitter like this.

1640
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:43,309
- Oh yeah.

1641
01:06:43,310 --> 01:06:45,679
- It's like chunky.
- I know.

1642
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:46,680
- I love it.

1643
01:06:58,120 --> 01:06:59,120
- It's okay.

1644
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,939
- I had a dream.
- Wow.

1645
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,343
- I know.
- That's is so dope.

1646
01:07:07,344 --> 01:07:09,009
(Emery laughing)

1647
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:11,469
- I always like feeling if
somebody's tats or like raised.

1648
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:12,285
- I know.

1649
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:13,118
- 'Cause I think sometimes they get.

1650
01:07:13,168 --> 01:07:14,060
- You think,

1651
01:07:14,061 --> 01:07:16,009
not really not after it heals.

1652
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:18,079
You don't have any tattoos?
- No.

1653
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,759
- Do you ever want tattoos?
- No.

1654
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,593
- No.

1655
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:23,179
(Emery laughing)

1656
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:25,849
- I'm afraid that if I get something,

1657
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:30,659
I'm not good with like styling tastes,

1658
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,376
so I feel like I'll like put something on

1659
01:07:32,377 --> 01:07:34,819
and be like, that is dumb.

1660
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:36,830
- Well, don't put it right here.

1661
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,989
(Emery laughing)

1662
01:07:37,990 --> 01:07:39,759
- [Noelle] Like a Rose.

1663
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,729
- I mean, okay, I think,

1664
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,439
my theory on tattoos is that

1665
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,161
they represent a time in your life

1666
01:07:46,162 --> 01:07:48,819
and it doesn't have to be a
thing that you love forever,

1667
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,036
you just can look at
it and be like, "Yeah,

1668
01:07:51,037 --> 01:07:52,596
"that time in my life that I had a dream

1669
01:07:52,597 --> 01:07:55,147
"and then it just happened."

1670
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:04,543
- Come on guys, let's go, let's go.

1671
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,599
- Oh okay.
- I know.

1672
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,950
- [Noelle] This is real cute.

1673
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:14,713
I'm gonna roll off.

1674
01:08:15,788 --> 01:08:16,788
Oh my God.

1675
01:08:18,017 --> 01:08:19,489
You know what?

1676
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:21,153
I'll sleep on this part.

1677
01:08:23,681 --> 01:08:24,681
- Come on.

1678
01:08:28,697 --> 01:08:29,780
Come on guys.

1679
01:08:33,516 --> 01:08:35,779
Come on, come on bud.

1680
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:37,229
- [Man] The main key
of all there maneuvers

1681
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:39,489
is to basically stay in the
power source of the wave,

1682
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,296
which is in the pocket where
the white water is breaking.

1683
01:08:42,297 --> 01:08:44,879
(gentle upbeat music)

1684
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:47,630
(birds chirping)

1685
01:09:18,956 --> 01:09:21,796
- [Announcer] Paging Paul,
dock three, dock three, Paul.

1686
01:09:21,797 --> 01:09:25,159
- Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why

1687
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,010
the order on paper doesn't
match what physically came in.

1688
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:30,692
- Well, Fox Print had a duplicate order.

1689
01:09:30,693 --> 01:09:32,639
There's supposed to be two of them.

1690
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,129
- There's only one here, all right.

1691
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:36,859
- I know I did two.
- Yeah.

1692
01:09:36,860 --> 01:09:37,693
- I was like what is this?

1693
01:09:37,694 --> 01:09:41,679
But this first one was all
the large, Xls and 2Xls

1694
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,100
and then the other one was like kid sizes.

1695
01:09:44,101 --> 01:09:45,262
- Okay.

1696
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:48,259
I think this may have been Martha's order,

1697
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,689
before she went on maternity leave.

1698
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:52,459
So let me just go up
front and check her desk

1699
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:53,729
and make sure it's not
just sitting up there.

1700
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:54,699
- Okay, thanks Mark,

1701
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:56,033
appreciate it.
- Cool, thanks.

1702
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:06,090
- Hey.

1703
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,140
- Hey.

1704
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:12,924
- That was so fun last night.

1705
01:10:12,925 --> 01:10:14,075
- Yeah, it was a blast.

1706
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:16,800
- Yup.

1707
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:20,819
Are you gonna be weird about it?

1708
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:21,653
- Nope.

1709
01:10:21,654 --> 01:10:22,849
Just went in and checked on the dogs

1710
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:25,349
and then you guys were in the bedroom

1711
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:28,099
and I had the night with the dogs.

1712
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,329

I'm just waiting for my Uber

completely miss Emery,

1782
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:35,823
I think she leaves today.

1783
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:38,440
