1
00:03:10,049 --> 00:03:12,847
Father, our neighbour
has brought a girl home.

2
00:03:13,052 --> 00:03:15,680
The poor thing is hurt.

3
00:03:16,055 --> 00:03:17,613
He is carrying her.

4
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:23,028
Look at that. Yusuf says
both those men are smugglers.

5
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:26,023
- They earn a lot of money.
- That is bad, son.

6
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:28,431
Death is preferable to this.

7
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:31,866
Why don't people thrash
those who do bad deeds?

8
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:36,041
Such people wield
influence with rich people.

9
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:38,441
Let's go.

10
00:04:03,502 --> 00:04:05,060
Who is it? Foolish jerk!

11
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:12,740
What is it?

12
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:15,743
This storm you have raised for
months of smuggling and promiscuity...

13
00:04:15,914 --> 00:04:18,075
End it right now.
Throw that whore out.

14
00:04:20,119 --> 00:04:22,747
Don't tempt fate.
Sit at home quietly.

15
00:04:23,122 --> 00:04:26,751
If we change our views,
you'll die a terrible death.

16
00:04:27,126 --> 00:04:30,095
If you must stay here, live
decently. Or we won't let you stay!

17
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,758
Why do you want to spoil
our mood? Get out of here!

18
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:38,433
Take a look at where
the master is going.

19
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,607
Do you think he's going
to our foe, the police?

20
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:00,955
- Hello.
- Yes, go on.

21
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,958
There's trouble brewing
in warehouse number 28.

22
00:05:04,496 --> 00:05:09,627
There's a master close by.
He has reported to the cops.

23
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:15,539
You ass! Why don't you send him to
his Maker before he reaches the cops?

24
00:05:16,175 --> 00:05:19,474
We got the news quite late.
What do we do now?

25
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,977
I'll check from the boss.

26
00:05:24,183 --> 00:05:26,913
These rascals had to
think of me at this moment!

27
00:05:30,689 --> 00:05:32,156
Who is it?

28
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:36,160
Why did you disturb me at this hour?

29
00:05:37,196 --> 00:05:38,754
Burn the warehouse!

30
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,756
Forget about the loss!

31
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:47,833
Tell those idiots to erase all
evidence before the cops arrive!

32
00:05:50,209 --> 00:05:52,677
Rescue my mother! She's inside!

33
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,181
My mother will be burnt!

34
00:05:58,717 --> 00:06:01,015
Uncle! Help my mother!

35
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,515
Who will lunge into this fire?

36
00:06:15,234 --> 00:06:16,861
Father! Mother is trapped inside!

37
00:06:19,238 --> 00:06:21,706
You wanted to be a leader. You've
destroyed us as well as yourself!

38
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,035
- Let go!
- Now where will we stay?

39
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:25,938
- First answer me!
- Move away!

40
00:06:39,258 --> 00:06:40,885
No!

41
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,888
Let go!

42
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,084
Doctor uncle, will
mother get well?

43
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:13,656
Everything is in God's hands.
Buy this medicine.

44
00:07:14,293 --> 00:07:16,261
Administer it to her every two
hours. I'll see her tomorrow.

45
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:24,094
You stay with mother.
I'll get the medicines.

46
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,770
Don't go anywhere, my brother.

47
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:33,267
Uncle! I need money for
my mother's medicines.

48
00:07:35,314 --> 00:07:36,941
Has your father left
money with me? Get lost!

49
00:07:37,316 --> 00:07:39,284
Why are you shooing the boy off?

50
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,947
You want money? Come here.

51
00:07:43,322 --> 00:07:44,789
Take this.

52
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:49,290
Want it for free?

53
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,964
The young one of the snake
won't be given milk for nothing!

54
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,797
The son has to pay for
the sins of the father.

55
00:07:57,336 --> 00:08:00,305
You'll get a buck for a slap.
Do you want the cash?

56
00:08:03,342 --> 00:08:04,809
Look at this.

57
00:08:06,345 --> 00:08:07,710
Answer.

58
00:08:08,347 --> 00:08:10,315
- Shall I slap you?
- What are you thinking?

59
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,647
So?

60
00:08:14,353 --> 00:08:15,650
Yes.

61
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:18,653
Mother!

62
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:20,054
- Want more?
- Yes.

63
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,157
Now 4 slaps for one buck?

64
00:08:32,037 --> 00:08:34,335
Why are they beating you?

65
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:36,331
I need money for mother's medicines.

66
00:08:37,376 --> 00:08:41,335
Beat me mover, sir. I need at least
10 bucks for mother's medicines.

67
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,010
You'll get twenty not just ten.

68
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:47,351
Ten for your mother
and ten for you.

69
00:08:48,387 --> 00:08:50,685
- Don't beat him sir!
- Why not?

70
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,188
- Will you take his share?
- Yes sir. Beat me instead.

71
00:08:54,393 --> 00:08:56,861
No, my mother is unwell!
I'll take the thrashing!

72
00:08:57,396 --> 00:08:59,364
Stop. Come here, son.

73
00:09:06,405 --> 00:09:07,770
Take this.

74
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,708
Mother! I've got your medicines!

75
00:09:14,913 --> 00:09:16,380
Now you will get well!

76
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,388
Mother!

77
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:32,660
What is this I see?

78
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,230
Tears in my son's eyes?

79
00:09:38,437 --> 00:09:41,895
Have you forgotten
all that I taught you?

80
00:09:44,443 --> 00:09:46,070
Sing that song for me.

81
00:09:48,113 --> 00:09:50,911
Won't you fulfill your
mother's dying wish?

82
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:56,421
Sing it fast, my son. Fast.

83
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:41,526
The master is no more!

84
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:47,193
He wanted to oppose us!
What a fool!

85
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:51,263
The gold is in the car
and the boss awaits us.

86
00:11:52,571 --> 00:11:53,936
Let's go.

87
00:12:20,098 --> 00:12:21,565
Beat him up!

88
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:27,566
You!

89
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:57,329
I'm dead!

90
00:12:57,636 --> 00:13:00,002
- What are you doing?
- You devils!!

91
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,597
You devils! What are you doing?

92
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:07,612
Let's get away! Hurry!

93
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:11,946
He's running away with the gold!

94
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:14,448
What? Catch him!

95
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:17,622
- He's running ahead!
- You chase him.

96
00:13:18,657 --> 00:13:19,954
You little devil!

97
00:13:22,661 --> 00:13:25,630
Hurry! Catch him!

98
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,365
Look at this! He's removed
the air from the tyre!

99
00:13:34,673 --> 00:13:36,300
The devil's younger
brother must be around.

100
00:13:56,695 --> 00:13:59,061
Vijay, did you find Munna?

101
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:03,156
Don't cry, Vijay.
Consider me Munna.

102
00:14:03,702 --> 00:14:06,671
From today I'm your
brother not only friend!

103
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:28,753
Are you and Nilam ready?

104
00:15:29,788 --> 00:15:31,255
Yes, boss. Absolutely.

105
00:17:22,901 --> 00:17:27,361
- I am going.
- Hey, where are you going?

106
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:28,870
I won't go with you!

107
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,868
- Are you deaf?
- Your Pop maybe deaf!

108
00:17:32,911 --> 00:17:34,879
Inspector sir!

109
00:17:35,914 --> 00:17:39,873
- I'm glad you came...
- Take your cart off the road.

110
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,387
My cart never took off
on the right track!

111
00:17:43,922 --> 00:17:46,891
She's not leaving her parental
home for her husband's home.

112
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:51,625
Unless she goes home, how
can a baby play in my arms?

113
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,899
Unless I have a baby, who will
carry my family name forward?

114
00:17:55,934 --> 00:17:57,401
To Hell with your family!

115
00:17:57,936 --> 00:17:59,904
Sir, I won't go with
this dwarfed man!

116
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:01,896
She called me a dwarf!

117
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:05,901
If not with this dwarf,
will you go with him?

118
00:18:06,945 --> 00:18:08,742
- Move the cart fast.
- How can I do that?

119
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,907
If I move the cart,
she will run for it.

120
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,909
I'll be darned. For 6 months I've
been waiting to consummate our union.

121
00:18:17,956 --> 00:18:22,256
What crazy fools! What are you
doing there sitting like monarchs?

122
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:24,929
Come here and move the cart.

123
00:18:28,967 --> 00:18:30,434
Hurry up!

124
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:48,441
Stop the jeep!
Don't leave me here!

125
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:53,548
My mynah...

126
00:18:54,993 --> 00:18:57,359
Never encourages me
Be sweet to me too.

127
00:18:57,495 --> 00:18:58,962
Is it for free?

128
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:12,977
I feel like shooting all of you!

129
00:19:14,012 --> 00:19:18,642
You all sit idle while Fakira
inflicts defeat upon us.

130
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:23,582
What can we do?
We don't know who he is.

131
00:19:23,755 --> 00:19:25,985
Where he lives. Like the
devil he swoops down on us.

132
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,720
Try to find out.

133
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:34,658
If this state continues,
someday we'll be beggars!

134
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,398
No doubt about it.

135
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:41,505
Give us another chance.

136
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,507
We will dig him out.

137
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:47,409
You always say that but
don't prove anything!

138
00:19:48,046 --> 00:19:49,673
Go and find that scoundrel!

139
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,847
Sir, an idea!

140
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,855
If you don't shut your mouth,
I'll have you skinned alive!

141
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:07,657
Such excellent ideas being
wasted on the unappreciative!

142
00:20:08,566 --> 00:20:10,693
Hey! Where are you
going with the bag?

143
00:20:13,071 --> 00:20:16,040
- Who are you? - A gentleman
asked me to give this bag to you.

144
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:44,933
- Who gave it to you?
- I swear I don't know.

145
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:49,665
He brought me here, gave me 10 bucks
Said, give this to the commissioner.

146
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:52,075
Catch anybody who is seen outside.

147
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:56,080
Greetings to the Police
Commissioner from Fakira.

148
00:20:58,116 --> 00:21:02,485
Sometimes people like me have
to get up to serve the nation.

149
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:07,091
I proffer the amount
stolen from the bank to you.

150
00:21:08,126 --> 00:21:13,086
It is all there except for my
service charge of 10000 rupees.

151
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:17,092
This amount maybe recovered
from the police charity.

152
00:21:18,136 --> 00:21:20,502
Your well wisher, Fakira.

153
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,437
Gently... you're hurting my wrist.

154
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:26,110
- Quiet!
- Good day, sir.

155
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,705
Only he was outside.

156
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:33,117
She, not he!

157
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:36,120
What were you doing here?

158
00:21:36,554 --> 00:21:39,455
May your stars shine bright.
I was out on a business tour.

159
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,626
To check if some policeman
has been blessed with a baby.

160
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:46,130
He arrested me and got me here.
What is my crime?

161
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:49,133
- Let her go. Him too.
- Come on.

162
00:21:50,168 --> 00:21:52,796
Thanks to me, you too
are safe. Good day sir.

163
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,867
Set the CID on her.

164
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:17,559
Baby... sweet babies...

165
00:22:21,199 --> 00:22:22,666
See you later. Go on.

166
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:36,007
You are strange. You returned
such a large sum of money!

167
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:38,182
This money belonged neither
to smuggler nor businessman.

168
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:42,017
It's public money.
How can we keep it?

169
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,689
Don't forget it's very difficult
to digest an honest man's money.

170
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,188
- It bursts forth like acid.
- I give up, Vijay.

171
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:02,198
Long live our Fakira.

172
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:05,937
Your Fakira has made me a pauper.

173
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:08,940
What are you doing?

174
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:12,045
- Feeling sleepy.
- Feeling sleepy?

175
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,218
- The bed is there.
- Join me.

176
00:23:14,752 --> 00:23:16,219
I'll sing you a lullaby
and put you to sleep.

177
00:23:17,255 --> 00:23:19,052
Have you ever looked at yourself?

178
00:23:19,257 --> 00:23:22,055
Often. 20 times
better than Vijay.

179
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,887
22 not 20.

180
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:27,230
Believe me now and come to me.

181
00:23:27,598 --> 00:23:29,725
Would you like to be spanked?

182
00:23:30,268 --> 00:23:31,895
I'd like dinner.

183
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,831
Dinner? I'm hungry.

184
00:23:38,276 --> 00:23:41,837
- Shall I eat you?
- Should I take off my shoe?

185
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:43,241
No, you're welcome to eat that.

186
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:46,079
I'll set you right today!

187
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:49,913
It's not right to
get angry over a joke.

188
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,263
You are great, boss!

189
00:23:59,363 --> 00:24:00,853
What a trick!

190
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,995
The police must be
searching the ship, Indiana.

191
00:24:04,302 --> 00:24:07,032
And you got the goodies
in the middle of the sea!

192
00:24:07,305 --> 00:24:10,763
- You're great!
- That's why I've never been jailed.

193
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:15,268
Turn these diamonds into
a necklace and overnight...

194
00:24:15,713 --> 00:24:18,011
Exhibit it in our
Honesty Jewelry shop.

195
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,117
Excuse me, where can
I find Kunwar Dilip Singh?

196
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,293
Strange man. Doesn't answer.

197
00:24:29,827 --> 00:24:32,125
Excuse me...

198
00:24:34,332 --> 00:24:37,028
Good God! He's flat out!

199
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:42,966
Murder! Murder!

200
00:24:53,351 --> 00:24:54,978
No!

201
00:24:56,354 --> 00:25:00,154
My brother has left me alone!

202
00:25:01,092 --> 00:25:02,992
My mother!

203
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:06,330
Screaming is not allowed here!

204
00:25:07,365 --> 00:25:11,165
What else do I do?
Blow the trumpet?

205
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:14,667
Can't you see what has
happened to my brother?

206
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:19,332
Nothing is wrong with him, this
is the art of holding your breath.

207
00:25:21,379 --> 00:25:27,079
Man can hold his breath for a
long period with his will power.

208
00:25:27,385 --> 00:25:31,014
He can only hold his
breath for 30 minutes.

209
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,358
Look at him! He's
coming back to consciousness.

210
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,863
Brother Vijay!

211
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:46,961
Live long.

212
00:25:49,407 --> 00:25:50,874
Why did you come here?

213
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:54,378
The news is that the diamonds
that the smugglers had brought in...

214
00:25:55,413 --> 00:26:00,214
...have been turned into a necklace
to be sold through Honesty Jewelers.

215
00:26:01,419 --> 00:26:03,751
- Where is Neelam?
- She is waiting.

216
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,795
Yes sir?

217
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:17,797
What do I say? Peer out and see
a car swaying like an elephant.

218
00:26:18,436 --> 00:26:19,801
Your life is made.

219
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:26,741
Nawab Jhumritalaiya has graced
your shop with his presence and family

220
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:32,405
I'll bring him in You quickly ask
the manager to greet him at the door.

221
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,412
- In a minute.
- Hurry!

222
00:26:36,854 --> 00:26:38,913
Sir, our destiny is looking up!

223
00:26:39,457 --> 00:26:41,425
The Nawab of Jhumritalaiya is here!

224
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,087
- Nawab?
- Yes, he'll buy in millions!

225
00:26:44,462 --> 00:26:47,431
Hurry and get some sweets,
cold drink, flowers, garlands...

226
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:51,924
- Greet him.
- Good day, sire...

227
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,438
Little master.
Please be seated here.

228
00:26:55,473 --> 00:26:57,441
I am pleased. Reward.

229
00:26:57,808 --> 00:26:59,275
No need for that, sire.

230
00:26:59,977 --> 00:27:03,435
Not accepting the reward
is tantamount to insulting sire.

231
00:27:05,483 --> 00:27:06,950
Thanks you.

232
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:13,788
As long as sire is in your shop,
no stranger should step in.

233
00:27:14,492 --> 00:27:16,119
Your will is our command.

234
00:27:16,494 --> 00:27:18,962
Stand at the gate.
Don't let anyone in.

235
00:27:19,897 --> 00:27:23,458
- Is that better sire?
- I'm much pleased by your obedience.

236
00:27:24,502 --> 00:27:25,969
Another reward.

237
00:27:27,505 --> 00:27:28,870
Sir...

238
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:33,477
- Sire, a garland...
- Here's the bouquet.

239
00:27:33,678 --> 00:27:34,975
Little master.

240
00:27:37,848 --> 00:27:39,475
Sweetmeats.

241
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:43,487
- Fruits.
- Prince...

242
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:48,992
What are you doing?

243
00:27:53,531 --> 00:27:54,998
Garland...

244
00:27:58,035 --> 00:28:01,493
These aren't made of butter.
Don't over eat or you'll catch cold.

245
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:05,841
Let him eat, sire. The little
master is a child. He'll digest it.

246
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:12,346
I wish to buy a diamond
necklace for my queen.

247
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:14,347
- Diamonds?
- Yes.

248
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:16,520
I'll pay for it in cash.

249
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:20,353
But I won't ask for a receipt.
Do you understand or not?

250
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:22,526
I've understood.
I'll present it in a flash.

251
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:27,196
Spare a glance at this necklace.

252
00:28:27,565 --> 00:28:29,123
It costs 4000000.

253
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:33,867
- Only 40 lakhs.
- This gladdens my heart!

254
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:37,370
Get me a cigarette!

255
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:43,377
Please tell my wife to come and
have a look at this necklace.

256
00:28:44,582 --> 00:28:48,040
Your madam slipped on a
banana peel this morning.

257
00:28:48,586 --> 00:28:50,053
She's been sneezing since then.

258
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,150
Look at her.

259
00:28:55,593 --> 00:28:59,552
Why didn't you tell me so? Stepping
on a bitter gourd would remedy it.

260
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,557
- I beg apologies.
- Doesn't matter.

261
00:29:01,932 --> 00:29:03,559
I'll put it round her neck
and see for myself.

262
00:29:03,934 --> 00:29:06,402
- But sire...
- Do you mind?

263
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:09,573
No, sir! Absolutely not.

264
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,067
This entire shop is yours.
Go right ahead.

265
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,574
I understand that.

266
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:17,242
- Go right ahead.
- Take care of my prince.

267
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:19,583
- Yes, sire.
- Don't eat too much, you hog.

268
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:28,183
And we are proud that at
the hands of Chimanbhai...

269
00:29:28,626 --> 00:29:31,595
- This hospital is being inaugurated
- Applause!

270
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:35,599
Here you are.

271
00:29:38,636 --> 00:29:40,103
Sir, call for you.

272
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:42,605
I'll be back soon.

273
00:29:46,644 --> 00:29:49,875
What? 4000000 in black?

274
00:29:50,648 --> 00:29:53,276
Reduce a couple of lakh
and sell it to him.

275
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:56,620
I'll reward you with 25000.

276
00:29:57,655 --> 00:29:59,350
All right. Fine.

277
00:30:03,661 --> 00:30:07,461
- Here you are.
- 100 bucks? - Your reward.

278
00:30:17,675 --> 00:30:20,644
Those two are looking at the
prince. They look like kidnappers.

279
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,648
- Throw the beggars out.
- No, they are not beggars.

280
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:27,651
- They are my Mom and Dad.
- Mom and Dad?

281
00:30:28,185 --> 00:30:29,652
And the Nawab?

282
00:30:30,688 --> 00:30:34,146
He gave me good clothes.
I want to stay with him.

283
00:30:35,693 --> 00:30:39,390
I see... what??
Locate the Nawab's car!

284
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,055
- He has gone.
- Gone!!

285
00:30:43,701 --> 00:30:45,669
Nitwits! Why didn't you stop him?

286
00:30:46,704 --> 00:30:49,434
He sat in the car in your
presence and gave us 100 bucks.

287
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:53,338
100 bucks!! His rewards
were our undoing!

288
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,509
- Leave this! Stop eating.
- No, I want to eat more.

289
00:30:56,714 --> 00:30:58,409
I'll feed you venom! Let go!

290
00:30:58,716 --> 00:31:00,684
Get out! Out!

291
00:31:01,118 --> 00:31:02,676
My child! Did he harm you?

292
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:05,180
- What has he done?
- Crooks! I'll have you arrested!

293
00:31:05,723 --> 00:31:08,191
- Why did you give him the child?
- He gave us 100 rupees for it.

294
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,092
Another 100 rupees!

295
00:31:11,729 --> 00:31:14,698
He paid 400 rupees and
swindled us of 40000!

296
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:20,693
I'll open 10 such hospitals
for my poor brethren.

297
00:31:21,138 --> 00:31:23,629
I'll beg for charity
with out stretched arms!

298
00:31:24,742 --> 00:31:26,869
If need be, I'll auction
the shirt off my back!

299
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:33,376
Hurry!

300
00:31:37,755 --> 00:31:41,213
- Swindled the Nawab?
- He swindled us.

301
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:43,056
What rubbish?

302
00:31:43,761 --> 00:31:45,558
Boss, we've been duped.

303
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:48,732
If was Fakira in
the guise of a Nawab!

304
00:31:48,933 --> 00:31:50,457
And he has turned us into paupers!

305
00:31:50,768 --> 00:31:52,793
Thank you oh Lord!

306
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:57,470
If these miracles continue,
my salary will grow to 1000!

307
00:31:57,775 --> 00:31:59,572
You are quite an ass and an imbecile!

308
00:31:59,777 --> 00:32:01,745
He conned you in bright daylight.

309
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,475
And you sat twiddling your thumbs!

310
00:32:04,782 --> 00:32:07,751
I've caught the child and its' parents

311
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:09,752
Will you ask them
to dig your grave?

312
00:32:10,187 --> 00:32:11,745
Throw them out.

313
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,155
Here he comes.

314
00:32:15,793 --> 00:32:17,761
I want to speak to you about my salary

315
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:24,427
Fools! Got fooled so easily.

316
00:32:24,802 --> 00:32:30,763
They've been conned so bad that
they will curse each other for ages.

317
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:32,768
Good, they got conned.

318
00:32:36,814 --> 00:32:38,281
What's wrong?

319
00:32:38,816 --> 00:32:40,784
We're carrying extra baggage.

320
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:20,221
Get out.

321
00:33:24,862 --> 00:33:26,329
Who are you?

322
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,562
A helpless girl.

323
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:35,498
Tell us the truth or
we'll bury you right here.

324
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:40,833
Honestly, it's the truth.
My parents are no more.

325
00:33:41,879 --> 00:33:43,847
My uncle wants to kill me
for my inheritance.

326
00:33:44,882 --> 00:33:48,841
I was alone at home.
A hood came to kill me.

327
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:52,253
I jumped out of the window
and ran but he chased me.

328
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,257
I reached the market
where your car was parked.

329
00:33:56,894 --> 00:34:00,762
Escaping the eyes of the
hood, I hid in the boot.

330
00:34:01,899 --> 00:34:03,696
This girl acts very well.

331
00:34:03,901 --> 00:34:06,199
You think my desperation is acting.

332
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:10,874
Don't help me if you don't want to.

333
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,537
Where is the exit?

334
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,872
Nobody who comes here
leaves without my permission.

335
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:25,149
You could be innocent or
a conspiracy of our enemies.

336
00:34:25,923 --> 00:34:28,619
If there is truth in your
words, we will help you.

337
00:34:28,926 --> 00:34:31,554
You'll get back your right.

338
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:34,397
But... if you are cheating us...

339
00:34:34,932 --> 00:34:39,892
Keep in mind... who you are...
where you came from...

340
00:34:40,938 --> 00:34:44,567
...where you went...
Nobody will have a clue.

341
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:48,639
I swear by my deceased parents...

342
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:52,404
- I speak the truth.
- What's the proof?

343
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:55,746
That we'll find out. Your name?

344
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:02,323
If your name is Geeta, the
Mahabharat is bound to follow.

345
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,929
I hope she won't turn
our Krishna into Duryodhana.

346
00:35:06,964 --> 00:35:09,432
I had no clue you'd
hate my name so much.

347
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:11,832
Or I'd give another name.

348
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:14,938
We still don't know whether
you're telling us a false name.

349
00:35:15,372 --> 00:35:18,432
How long will it take to find
if she's telling the truth?

350
00:35:18,976 --> 00:35:20,443
What's your uncle's name?

351
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:26,108
There are full chances of
our Lanka getting burnt.

352
00:35:26,984 --> 00:35:28,952
Get rid of this poison girl.

353
00:35:29,987 --> 00:35:31,614
How can she harm us?

354
00:35:32,389 --> 00:35:34,949
These girls have destroyed
the saints of yonder.

355
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:36,952
You and I hardly matter.

356
00:35:37,995 --> 00:35:41,954
- I too am a girl.
- You too create problems.

357
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,798
When we have a downfall
you will be the cause for it.

358
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,400
Tell him to shut up or
I'll smash his teeth in!

359
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:50,974
Quiet, both of you.
Where do you stay?

360
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:56,312
We're really destroyed.

361
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:04,317
Till we find out all about you,
you can't leave this place.

362
00:36:06,023 --> 00:36:08,491
- Take her to the room downstairs.
- Follow me.

363
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:15,658
Always scolding me!

364
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:25,406
And you come up with me
to the room upstairs.

365
00:36:25,709 --> 00:36:27,734
Neelam, I've often told you...

366
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:29,512
We are only business partners.

367
00:36:31,048 --> 00:36:34,017
Get the thought of becoming my
life partner out of your heart.

368
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:42,514
Where is the heart?
You've taken that away.

369
00:36:59,076 --> 00:37:00,543
Come inside.

370
00:37:05,082 --> 00:37:08,711
- Where is the light switch?
- In your hands and mine.

371
00:37:10,087 --> 00:37:11,554
I don't understand.

372
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:19,892
Try for yourself.

373
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:29,802
A bed to sleep in.

374
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,068
Clothes in that cupboard
should you require them.

375
00:37:34,111 --> 00:37:37,080
If you try to leave this
place without permission...

376
00:37:38,615 --> 00:37:40,742
My pigeons will start twittering.

377
00:37:41,118 --> 00:37:45,418
They may look tiny but
if they get after somebody...

378
00:37:46,123 --> 00:37:48,921
The person might lose his life.

379
00:37:49,526 --> 00:37:52,586
Do you still doubt me?

380
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:54,091
I don't spare my Pop!

381
00:38:12,149 --> 00:38:16,108
How dare you send my young
daughter to such a risky place?

382
00:38:18,155 --> 00:38:20,123
Why didn't you ask me?

383
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,120
If any harm befalls Neeta,
I'll consume poison and die!

384
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,963
You worry for no reason.

385
00:38:32,169 --> 00:38:34,137
She can handle 10 gangsters.

386
00:38:35,172 --> 00:38:38,630
Nobody can beat her at
judo, karate and gun firing.

387
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:42,977
I've raised my daughter like a son.

388
00:38:44,181 --> 00:38:46,149
She can protect herself.

389
00:38:46,683 --> 00:38:48,810
Besides, she's a
responsible CID officer.

390
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:52,815
Even the devil not just men
would run at sighting her.

391
00:38:52,923 --> 00:38:54,413
Blow your own trumpet!
Never pay heed to me!

392
00:38:55,192 --> 00:38:59,151
Are the cops in the police force
women that you had to send my baby?

393
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:11,003
Chimanbhai here.
What about Fakira?

394
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:14,006
We are on his tail.
We'll arrest him very soon.

395
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:17,669
Why haven't you arrested him
so far? What is the police doing?

396
00:39:18,215 --> 00:39:22,174
When the time comes you
will know what we're doing.

397
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,781
Like Hell we'll know!
I'm a servant of the public.

398
00:39:27,224 --> 00:39:31,183
The public demands to know who'll
safeguard their lives and property.

399
00:39:31,628 --> 00:39:33,186
I have a request...

400
00:39:34,231 --> 00:39:36,961
If you won't do anything
I'll stage a protest march.

401
00:39:37,234 --> 00:39:38,701
Take out a procession.

402
00:39:39,236 --> 00:39:42,865
Go on a fast in front of
your office. Shout slogans.

403
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:49,042
If no action is forthcoming,
you are aware of my power.

404
00:39:54,251 --> 00:39:57,880
As for you... I thought you
were the lion of the forest.

405
00:39:58,922 --> 00:40:03,222
But you turned out to be the
paper lion children play with.

406
00:40:04,261 --> 00:40:08,061
And tears it to shreds
whenever he feels like it.

407
00:40:08,932 --> 00:40:10,627
I want a credible lion.

408
00:40:11,268 --> 00:40:13,896
Who will cleave the
vultures and the jackals!

409
00:40:14,604 --> 00:40:18,904
I want a ferocious
beast in human form!

410
00:40:20,277 --> 00:40:22,575
Mankind should fear him.

411
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:27,910
Have you heard of Toofan?

412
00:40:31,288 --> 00:40:35,247
Yes. All the gangsters fear him.

413
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:44,529
Name like Toofan (Storm)
But the form of an ant.

414
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:46,929
I swear by the Maker...

415
00:40:48,705 --> 00:40:51,105
I've never seen a
donkey greater than you.

416
00:40:51,308 --> 00:40:52,673
What???

417
00:40:55,712 --> 00:40:59,671
Worm! An ant can kill an elephant.

418
00:41:00,317 --> 00:41:01,944
And you're just an ass!

419
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,289
Hey ant! I'll crush you to death!

420
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:09,021
First drink some water.
You're perspiring away.

421
00:41:09,826 --> 00:41:13,284
I've been released from prison after
2 years. Do you want me to go back?

422
00:41:14,331 --> 00:41:15,628
What do we have in common?

423
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:21,293
Two rulers can't live in one kingdom.

424
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:26,298
To blazes with your monarchs.
Why get hot under the collar?

425
00:41:27,344 --> 00:41:30,780
- What are you watching? A drink.
- Here you are.

426
00:41:32,349 --> 00:41:33,646
He won't drink this.

427
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,830
Swear by the Maker, you've
invited your own doom!

428
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:23,366
Now tell me, which
kingdom you rule.

429
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:25,364
- Punch your brains out?
- Let him go, son!

430
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:29,201
- He doesn't know you.
- He'll bark again!

431
00:42:29,806 --> 00:42:31,364
Forgive him.

432
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:35,869
You're fortunate, bald man
that uncle is here.

433
00:42:36,413 --> 00:42:42,045
Else you would return in
a coffin not your own feet!

434
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:51,792
I don't approve of anyone
carrying guns in my presence.

435
00:42:54,431 --> 00:42:57,400
But I am your friend not foe.

436
00:42:58,435 --> 00:43:00,403
I've come for a job.

437
00:43:01,438 --> 00:43:02,735
Look at this.

438
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:10,412
Now talk...

439
00:43:11,448 --> 00:43:13,416
You've returned from prison only today

440
00:43:13,783 --> 00:43:15,410
So you'll really need this.

441
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:19,148
I swear by the Maker,
you're really smart.

442
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:21,424
- What's the job?
- Job?

443
00:43:22,459 --> 00:43:24,757
You have to bump off somebody.

444
00:43:26,463 --> 00:43:29,432
- Why?
- Somebody who is not my foe...

445
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,427
I don't kill him.

446
00:43:34,471 --> 00:43:38,100
You can't kill him but
you can bring him to us?

447
00:43:38,475 --> 00:43:40,443
That's much better.

448
00:43:40,977 --> 00:43:43,445
- Who is he?
- Don't know.

449
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:46,449
Suddenly you've turned
from smart guy to fool.

450
00:43:47,484 --> 00:43:49,452
How would I know if you don't?

451
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:53,945
He has always appeared in disguise.

452
00:43:54,491 --> 00:43:57,460
- Any address?
- Don't know that either.

453
00:43:59,496 --> 00:44:01,191
He has one special style.

454
00:44:01,898 --> 00:44:05,459
He throws away the front half of
the cigarette before smoking it.

455
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:20,312
Did what she said turn out
to be the truth or lies?

456
00:44:21,518 --> 00:44:25,818
It's true. The house does exist
and it bears her uncle's name.

457
00:44:26,523 --> 00:44:29,151
My jewelry and papers of
inheritance are in the vault.

458
00:44:29,526 --> 00:44:33,826
I'll be grateful to you
if I can get them back.

459
00:44:35,031 --> 00:44:37,329
It's our duty to help the weak.

460
00:44:40,537 --> 00:44:42,334
You'll get your things tonight.

461
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:44,506
Take her back home.

462
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:50,504
Meet me near her house at midnight
after fixing the vault business.

463
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:53,516
Fine. Let's go.

464
00:44:59,556 --> 00:45:00,955
From where did he land up?

465
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:03,526
I'll have to order new furniture.

466
00:45:03,893 --> 00:45:07,886
Is this a hotel or a cemetery?
Why are you quiet? Play on!

467
00:49:38,835 --> 00:49:41,463
Waiter, get sir another peg.

468
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,808
Swear by the Maker,
you're quite something.

469
00:49:46,843 --> 00:49:49,471
Swear by the Destroyer,
you too are intense.

470
00:49:50,346 --> 00:49:53,645
- Introduce yourself.
- Praise the Lord who made the earth.

471
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,215
What am I compared to him?

472
00:49:56,853 --> 00:49:59,822
Tell me something about
yourself if you wish.

473
00:50:00,857 --> 00:50:02,154
Don't you know me?

474
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:05,657
Petty things miss my eyes.

475
00:50:06,863 --> 00:50:09,229
You have a long tongue.

476
00:50:09,866 --> 00:50:11,834
Hands longer than that.

477
00:50:12,368 --> 00:50:15,337
Nobody dares to chatter
like this in my presence!

478
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:17,339
I am Toofan!

479
00:50:17,874 --> 00:50:21,833
Anything that comes in my path
is blown away like straw!

480
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:28,681
And I'm the mountain that the storm
encounters only to flee in return.

481
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:30,352
There goes my furniture!

482
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:36,348
My Lords, it would be great
if you would talk with love.

483
00:50:36,893 --> 00:50:38,861
Reputed men come to my bar.

484
00:50:39,228 --> 00:50:40,718
Do you mean we're not respectable?

485
00:50:41,898 --> 00:50:45,197
- You're better than the best!
- What do you think of me?

486
00:50:45,902 --> 00:50:49,861
May God smile at you.
You're our King!

487
00:50:50,907 --> 00:50:56,539
- Recognise me?
- I can forget my father not you.

488
00:50:56,913 --> 00:50:59,541
As soon as I saw you enter,
I told the waiter to...

489
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:02,544
...present anything that
you 'd like to eat or drink.

490
00:51:02,919 --> 00:51:04,887
And not present the bill
even if you demand it.

491
00:51:05,254 --> 00:51:06,551
I'm pleased.

492
00:51:07,924 --> 00:51:09,892
Pleased to meet you too.

493
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:16,228
- The reason for that?
- The heart knows that.

494
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:18,901
But what's the point in
telling before a drink?

495
00:51:19,936 --> 00:51:24,236
Get the bottle. Today
we'll drink hard to our meeting.

496
00:51:24,941 --> 00:51:27,910
I drink gently not hard.

497
00:51:28,945 --> 00:51:30,572
Have a double on me.

498
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:34,917
This man is slipping away.

499
00:51:35,952 --> 00:51:38,921
Than God the bottle and
the furniture is safe!

500
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:50,933
- What do you want?
- Try to understand.

501
00:51:51,467 --> 00:51:52,934
Want a lift?

502
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:58,430
Hearing my words from your lips.

503
00:52:01,978 --> 00:52:03,946
Some relation of a previous birth.

504
00:52:04,981 --> 00:52:08,439
How would you like us to have
some relation in this birth too?

505
00:52:09,986 --> 00:52:13,285
- I don't understand.
- I'll explain on the way.

506
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,524
You didn't tell me
where you want to go.

507
00:52:26,002 --> 00:52:27,970
This time you're losing touch.

508
00:52:29,005 --> 00:52:32,964
Swear by the Maker, you can't
guess what's in my heart.

509
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,638
Anyway, I'm illiterate.

510
00:52:39,015 --> 00:52:41,813
I can't read.
You read this.

511
00:52:49,025 --> 00:52:52,483
- I don't understand, dear brother.
- Adorable brother...

512
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:57,329
I've accepted Rs. 10000
advance from them to nab you.

513
00:52:58,034 --> 00:52:59,865
I'll get another 10
once you reach them.

514
00:53:01,037 --> 00:53:03,505
Doesn't that bind us in a relation?

515
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,507
I earned 20000 from you.

516
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:10,411
- If I refuse to go?
- Same amount for the corpse.

517
00:53:13,049 --> 00:53:14,607
But take the pistol
away from my temple.

518
00:53:16,452 --> 00:53:19,012
I'll shoot your brains out
if you make any funny moves.

519
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:39,701
Sonny be my disciple and learn
something. Then become a hood!

520
00:53:40,076 --> 00:53:44,035
This is the first jerk. If we meet
again, you'll forget your ancestors!

521
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:47,879
You used a machine to show me down!

522
00:53:48,084 --> 00:53:49,779
But I trust my arms!

523
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:54,716
I swear I'll kill you in a place
where you'll pine for water!

524
00:53:56,092 --> 00:53:58,060
Fool! Nitwit!

525
00:54:43,139 --> 00:54:45,437
I'll shoot you if you move!

526
00:54:47,143 --> 00:54:49,111
You wanted to kill me
with the help of this hood!

527
00:54:49,645 --> 00:54:51,112
I'll show you!

528
00:54:59,155 --> 00:55:01,783
This is Hanuman Singh
from 12 Love Lane.

529
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:05,790
A thief is here. Come immediately.

530
00:55:08,164 --> 00:55:11,964
He'll go to prison.
Then I'll set you straight.

531
00:55:13,169 --> 00:55:14,727
Throw down your pistol.

532
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:18,864
This is the muzzle of
a pistol not a finger!

533
00:55:19,675 --> 00:55:23,133
Throw it or the bullet will be
in you and your life winging away.

534
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,647
Throw it!

535
00:55:32,188 --> 00:55:34,156
Stop or I'll shoot!

536
00:55:40,196 --> 00:55:43,165
Vijay! Hurry!

537
00:56:07,223 --> 00:56:08,850
You have very good aim.

538
00:56:15,231 --> 00:56:18,200
So... how are you sir?

539
00:56:20,236 --> 00:56:23,205
A fool by name and acts smart.

540
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:31,203
Give me an opportunity real fast
to handcuff you and the other hoods.

541
00:56:32,248 --> 00:56:36,708
When you find the truth,
your head will be reeling.

542
00:56:37,253 --> 00:56:39,551
The earth will slip out
from under your feet.

543
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:45,989
Darling, you're so cruel.

544
00:56:50,266 --> 00:56:52,234
I wish I were the photograph.

545
00:57:03,279 --> 00:57:04,576
Why have you come here?

546
00:57:05,281 --> 00:57:08,079
You thought of me
and I came attracted.

547
00:57:09,285 --> 00:57:11,913
- Like bees to honey.
- Somebody might come!

548
00:57:12,288 --> 00:57:13,755
God's will be done.

549
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,917
Now you must go!

550
00:57:16,292 --> 00:57:21,252
You love the photograph but
are so curt with the person.

551
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:25,096
The picture is silent but you speak.

552
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:27,269
Then I'll be quiet.

553
00:57:27,803 --> 00:57:30,101
Love me too.

554
00:57:31,307 --> 00:57:33,775
How would I know if
your love is true?

555
00:57:36,312 --> 00:57:39,941
My love is true not false.

556
01:02:06,582 --> 01:02:08,209
Where shall I take Her Majesty?

557
01:02:08,584 --> 01:02:13,044
The oars of my boat are in your
hands. Take me wherever you wish.

558
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:16,057
Fine. I'll take you to the wedding.

559
01:02:17,593 --> 01:02:19,891
- Wedding?
- Of the daughter of a poor man.

560
01:02:20,596 --> 01:02:23,895
If you desire, we too
could get married there.

561
01:02:58,634 --> 01:03:01,603
Mother! My mother will be burnt!

562
01:03:28,664 --> 01:03:30,632
Why did you leave?

563
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:36,468
That fire reminded me of the
fire that destroyed my world.

564
01:03:38,674 --> 01:03:40,642
But there's such a difference
between the two fires.

565
01:03:41,677 --> 01:03:43,645
This fire unites two strangers.

566
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,649
And that fire left me alone
to live tormented in this world.

567
01:03:48,183 --> 01:03:49,980
I don't understand.

568
01:03:50,686 --> 01:03:52,381
Do you want to understand?

569
01:03:54,690 --> 01:04:00,151
Come, I'll show you the
festering wound of my life.

570
01:04:02,698 --> 01:04:05,667
Hey, that's Kunwar Dilip Singh!
Hurry!

571
01:04:07,703 --> 01:04:10,001
The Prince is here!

572
01:04:10,706 --> 01:04:12,674
Come on!

573
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:22,673
This school of my father and this
temple stand witness to our ruin.

574
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:31,182
Once I relished life to the hilt
in the portals of this temple.

575
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:35,026
Then I held these walls and wept.

576
01:04:35,731 --> 01:04:37,699
This heart is a graveyard of memories.

577
01:04:38,734 --> 01:04:41,703
I can't tell you how many incidents
and tragedies lie buried in it.

578
01:04:43,739 --> 01:04:46,037
Life has been very cruel to you.

579
01:04:47,743 --> 01:04:51,201
But you faced it without bowing.

580
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:56,144
You have been the support of count
less poverty stricken families.

581
01:04:56,752 --> 01:04:58,720
You constructed a school for children.

582
01:04:59,755 --> 01:05:02,724
This portrait of your
life is so beautiful.

583
01:05:03,158 --> 01:05:04,716
All said and done, he is a criminal.

584
01:05:07,763 --> 01:05:09,390
What is the meaning of
praising him to the skies?

585
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:12,724
Definitely not what you think.

586
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:16,738
I know my duty.
He is in my hand.

587
01:05:17,272 --> 01:05:19,240
If I wish I can have
him arrested today.

588
01:05:19,775 --> 01:05:21,743
He should be arrested.

589
01:05:22,778 --> 01:05:25,144
But there's no point
in arresting him alone.

590
01:05:26,782 --> 01:05:30,240
We can get to the other smugglers
and their leaders through him.

591
01:05:30,786 --> 01:05:35,086
We can arrest Fakira any
time once they are nabbed.

592
01:05:52,808 --> 01:05:54,776
I'm always worried about you.

593
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:57,176
Take care.

594
01:05:57,813 --> 01:05:59,781
Inform me whenever you need help.

595
01:06:00,816 --> 01:06:04,115
- Shall I leave?
- Won't you meet mother?

596
01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:05,786
I've already met her. Okay?

597
01:06:38,854 --> 01:06:41,550
- You?
- Where are you coming from?

598
01:06:42,858 --> 01:06:44,826
- From the bathroom.
- From out?

599
01:06:45,861 --> 01:06:48,830
Out? I went with Vijay.

600
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:53,426
Where did you go
after dropping Vijay?

601
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:58,169
Talk to me with respect so
I can answer you with respect.

602
01:06:58,874 --> 01:07:02,833
You witch! I know the real you.

603
01:07:03,378 --> 01:07:07,838
You want to ensnare Vijay
and land him in prison!

604
01:07:10,886 --> 01:07:12,353
You have tortured me.

605
01:07:13,889 --> 01:07:18,258
Made me jealous! I'll kill you!

606
01:08:00,936 --> 01:08:02,665
What is going on? Let go!

607
01:08:02,938 --> 01:08:04,303
What madness is this?

608
01:08:04,940 --> 01:08:06,908
- Aren't you ashamed? Fighting!
- Shoot this bitch!

609
01:08:07,109 --> 01:08:08,406
What nonsense is this!

610
01:08:08,944 --> 01:08:11,742
You rejected my love for this witch!

611
01:08:12,948 --> 01:08:15,917
But I warn you she will
leave you in pain for life!

612
01:08:16,451 --> 01:08:19,909
- Are you mad?
- It's you who is mad!

613
01:08:20,122 --> 01:08:21,419
Do you know who she is?

614
01:08:21,957 --> 01:08:23,424
She is a spy!

615
01:08:33,969 --> 01:08:36,938
She... she is lying!

616
01:08:37,372 --> 01:08:41,433
She's lying! I saw her getting out
of the police commissioner's office!

617
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:43,268
I have never gone there!

618
01:08:43,979 --> 01:08:47,938
She is jealous of me! So
she's doing this to break us up!

619
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:50,781
Is it not true that your
name is Neeta not Geeta?

620
01:08:51,987 --> 01:08:54,956
Is it a lie that you are the
police commissioners' daughter?

621
01:08:57,993 --> 01:09:02,362
I swear I am Geeta.

622
01:09:02,998 --> 01:09:07,697
The orphan Geeta whom
you encouraged to live.

623
01:09:08,003 --> 01:09:09,561
Every word she utters is a lie!

624
01:09:10,338 --> 01:09:11,965
She is your enemy and mine!

625
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:13,739
Kill her!!!

626
01:09:15,010 --> 01:09:18,309
This is my personal matter.
Let me handle it.

627
01:09:19,347 --> 01:09:20,746
You may leave.

628
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:38,659
Honestly, she is wrongly accusing me!

629
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:42,503
I completely believe you.

630
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:46,007
...that you are alone and
have nobody in this world.

631
01:09:47,042 --> 01:09:48,509
Yes.

632
01:09:51,046 --> 01:09:52,411
You are my life.

633
01:09:53,048 --> 01:09:54,743
And I mean the world to you.

634
01:09:56,051 --> 01:09:57,518
Isn't it?

635
01:09:59,054 --> 01:10:01,022
Don't you trust my love?

636
01:10:03,058 --> 01:10:04,525
I do.

637
01:10:06,061 --> 01:10:10,760
And after today I won't
ask you this question.

638
01:10:33,088 --> 01:10:36,455
You... why have you brought me here?

639
01:10:37,092 --> 01:10:39,560
To make him the witness to my love.

640
01:10:40,095 --> 01:10:44,054
Lord, in your presence I accept...

641
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,567
This woman is my world.

642
01:10:47,102 --> 01:10:49,400
I love her from the depths of my soul.

643
01:10:50,105 --> 01:10:53,905
If I die before her,
it is my desire...

644
01:10:55,110 --> 01:10:57,476
Her face be in front of my eyes.

645
01:11:17,132 --> 01:11:18,759
What have you done?

646
01:11:19,134 --> 01:11:20,692
This is the last wish of lovers.

647
01:11:22,137 --> 01:11:25,595
I have accepted you as my
wife in the presence of God.

648
01:11:27,142 --> 01:11:28,609
No!

649
01:11:30,145 --> 01:11:32,113
This can't be true!

650
01:11:33,481 --> 01:11:35,449
This can't be true!

651
01:11:46,161 --> 01:11:50,928
Why did you do this...
without asking me?

652
01:11:53,168 --> 01:11:55,136
So that you can go
and tell your Dad...

653
01:11:55,503 --> 01:11:57,130
Fakira is your husband!

654
01:11:58,173 --> 01:12:03,975
Now if I am shot, the commissioner's
son-in-law dies, not Fakira!

655
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:06,545
I considered you my life.

656
01:12:07,182 --> 01:12:09,150
And you made fun of my love.

657
01:12:10,185 --> 01:12:14,884
I will pine for you all my life
but not alone! You too will pine!

658
01:12:16,191 --> 01:12:17,886
Even if you wash off this vermilion...

659
01:12:19,194 --> 01:12:20,559
You won't be able to forget it.

660
01:12:21,196 --> 01:12:24,825
No other man will be able to
adorn this hair with vermilion!

661
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,159
You will have to turn him down
and not give any reasons.

662
01:12:30,205 --> 01:12:32,173
You will be tortured! All your life!

663
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:36,177
No! Forgive me!

664
01:12:39,214 --> 01:12:42,183
I was what I was earlier.

665
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:48,189
But now I am not what I was then.

666
01:12:49,224 --> 01:12:50,851
Forgive me.

667
01:12:52,227 --> 01:12:55,685
Forgive me! Please!

668
01:18:17,552 --> 01:18:19,520
Should I address you
as Geeta or Neeta?

669
01:18:20,555 --> 01:18:23,854
No, call me Geeta.

670
01:18:32,567 --> 01:18:34,034
Somebody is at the door.

671
01:18:44,579 --> 01:18:46,547
You'll be shot if
you make a run for it!

672
01:18:49,584 --> 01:18:50,949
Come on!

673
01:19:09,103 --> 01:19:12,072
What are you doing here?
Anything special?

674
01:19:13,608 --> 01:19:15,075
You're acting innocent!

675
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:18,578
I don't get it.

676
01:19:19,614 --> 01:19:21,582
Why did you have Vijay arrested?

677
01:19:22,617 --> 01:19:23,914
Who is Vijay?

678
01:19:24,619 --> 01:19:25,916
I gave no such orders.

679
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:28,316
But why are you so worried for him?

680
01:19:28,623 --> 01:19:30,090
Why are you so annoyed?

681
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:40,100
Is this drama or reality?

682
01:19:41,636 --> 01:19:44,605
Answer me. Why do you have
vermilion in your hair?

683
01:19:45,139 --> 01:19:48,267
Vermilion? What???

684
01:19:48,643 --> 01:19:51,612
- Where is it?
- In my hair.

685
01:19:52,647 --> 01:19:56,606
- Do you know what it implies?
- Now I know.

686
01:19:57,051 --> 01:19:58,609
What is his name?
What does he do?

687
01:20:00,655 --> 01:20:02,282
Who are his parents?

688
01:20:03,658 --> 01:20:05,888
Why don't you answer?

689
01:20:06,661 --> 01:20:09,027
What can she say? We're
left with no face to answer.

690
01:20:10,665 --> 01:20:13,133
You asked who he is.
I'll tell you.

691
01:20:14,669 --> 01:20:17,137
He is a cheat! He commits thefts!

692
01:20:17,672 --> 01:20:20,641
Such scoundrels have neither
family nor background!

693
01:20:21,175 --> 01:20:23,643
They are a blot on the name
of the nation and society!

694
01:20:23,945 --> 01:20:26,470
He is not as you describe him!
He is a decent human being!

695
01:20:26,681 --> 01:20:30,310
He is like the lotus that
flowers even in the muck!

696
01:20:30,518 --> 01:20:32,486
- Quiet!
- Send her out on jobs!

697
01:20:32,687 --> 01:20:34,484
Turn your daughter into a son!

698
01:20:35,022 --> 01:20:37,320
She's really ruined our name!

699
01:20:38,192 --> 01:20:40,319
The son-in-law of the police
commissioner is a thief!

700
01:20:40,695 --> 01:20:43,664
Print your picture with
your son-in-law in the papers!

701
01:20:44,031 --> 01:20:45,999
Wouldn't I shoot him before that?

702
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,998
I don't accept this marriage!
Wipe off the vermilion!

703
01:20:49,103 --> 01:20:50,502
- That's not possible!
- Shut up!

704
01:20:52,707 --> 01:20:54,402
You will have to remove
him from your heart!

705
01:20:54,542 --> 01:20:56,669
- Before that I'll leave this house!
- What did you say?

706
01:20:57,712 --> 01:20:59,680
Don't you dare step out of this house!

707
01:21:00,715 --> 01:21:02,683
You can leave this house
only after you are married!

708
01:21:02,884 --> 01:21:05,682
- I am already married!
- I said I don't accept it!

709
01:21:05,887 --> 01:21:07,184
What difference does that make?

710
01:21:10,725 --> 01:21:13,694
So... you set out to beat me.

711
01:21:14,228 --> 01:21:16,196
Got the fight out of you?

712
01:21:17,732 --> 01:21:20,701
Stop! Bravo!

713
01:21:41,756 --> 01:21:44,725
- Surprised?
- No.

714
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,320
Seeing the real you has saddened me.

715
01:21:48,763 --> 01:21:50,731
This sorrow can still turn to joy.

716
01:21:51,766 --> 01:21:54,291
If you promise to do as I say.

717
01:21:54,769 --> 01:21:59,570
Would I dance to the tune of one
whose blood is tainted with treachery?

718
01:21:59,774 --> 01:22:03,471
The fight hasn't gone out of you.

719
01:22:07,782 --> 01:22:09,579
Stop! Don't beat him!

720
01:22:09,784 --> 01:22:12,252
If I don't beat him,
should I welcome him?

721
01:22:12,787 --> 01:22:17,747
- I'll set him right!
- You've done all you had to.

722
01:22:19,794 --> 01:22:22,763
You mustn't beat a decent man so much.

723
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,097
Hope you're not hurt too much.

724
01:22:27,802 --> 01:22:30,134
Hurts less than the wound
you're stabbing the nation with.

725
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:33,773
Do you know me?

726
01:22:34,208 --> 01:22:37,769
How would I recognise the man
the Lord Almighty couldn't!

727
01:22:38,813 --> 01:22:41,179
But I have caught a glimpse today.

728
01:22:41,315 --> 01:22:44,773
Move aside. I'll show him the sights.

729
01:22:45,219 --> 01:22:47,779
No. Anger is not good.

730
01:22:48,823 --> 01:22:50,791
I'm burning in the fire of revenge!

731
01:22:51,826 --> 01:22:56,786
I swear nobody has
humiliated me and survived!

732
01:22:57,832 --> 01:22:59,129
I will kill him!

733
01:22:59,333 --> 01:23:03,793
If you have the courage and are
your mother's son, uncuff me!

734
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:06,468
Then we'll see how kills whom!

735
01:23:07,842 --> 01:23:09,810
Undo his bonds!

736
01:23:11,846 --> 01:23:13,643
Fakira looks good in chains.

737
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:18,478
- No jokes, I give tit for tat.
- No.

738
01:23:18,853 --> 01:23:23,654
Never poison a man who
can die with honey.

739
01:23:24,859 --> 01:23:26,827
Love reforms the worst crooks.

740
01:23:27,862 --> 01:23:30,660
And this poor unfortunate
soul is a mere human being.

741
01:23:31,265 --> 01:23:34,826
We're brothers. He's a thief like us.

742
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:38,839
- Isn't it, son?
- No, son Chimanlal.

743
01:23:39,874 --> 01:23:42,672
Though we're thieves, we're different.

744
01:23:42,877 --> 01:23:44,845
Really? What difference?

745
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:49,839
You steal from the public and the
government and I steal from you!

746
01:23:50,885 --> 01:23:52,352
What difference does that make?

747
01:23:52,887 --> 01:23:56,516
Every man steals from one
who is less smart than him.

748
01:23:56,891 --> 01:24:00,850
I am worthy of the public and the
government so I cheat both of them.

749
01:24:01,896 --> 01:24:04,797
You are smarter than me
so you make a fool of me.

750
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:09,859
But when I came to my senses,
you're handcuffed in front of me.

751
01:24:10,905 --> 01:24:14,864
It's her treachery not your
intelligence that brought me here!

752
01:24:15,910 --> 01:24:18,879
It is smart to divide and rule.

753
01:24:19,914 --> 01:24:22,883
I can annihilate you if I wish.

754
01:24:23,918 --> 01:24:25,545
But I won't do so.

755
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,218
Because I appreciate intelligence.

756
01:24:28,589 --> 01:24:29,886
You have brains.

757
01:24:30,257 --> 01:24:32,623
I have the power. Wealth.

758
01:24:32,927 --> 01:24:37,387
If we join forces, we can ruin
the government and the public!

759
01:24:37,932 --> 01:24:41,390
- What do you say?
- My doubts were right.

760
01:24:42,937 --> 01:24:44,495
- What?
- Just this...

761
01:24:44,939 --> 01:24:47,407
...that you are not your father's son!

762
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:52,572
Only a pervert can betray his nation!

763
01:24:52,947 --> 01:24:56,405
Take him to the torture chamber
and torment him till he dies!

764
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:08,258
You had promised
you wouldn't kill him!

765
01:25:08,963 --> 01:25:12,763
I haven't killed him
I haven't even touched him.

766
01:25:13,968 --> 01:25:17,768
You are a filthy dog
who can't keep his promise!

767
01:25:18,973 --> 01:25:20,770
Are you a picture of loyalty?

768
01:25:21,375 --> 01:25:24,936
You are disloyal and
expect loyalty from others?

769
01:25:25,312 --> 01:25:28,941
And in what way is that
scoundrel better that me?

770
01:25:29,316 --> 01:25:31,284
I wouldn't give you a second glance!

771
01:25:31,986 --> 01:25:35,786
You won't spit at me, my love
you'll lick my heels!

772
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:37,787
Take her to my room!

773
01:25:39,994 --> 01:25:41,962
- Come...
- Boss...

774
01:25:42,997 --> 01:25:44,965
Square up my account.

775
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,968
Your account will be
squared up tomorrow.

776
01:25:50,004 --> 01:25:52,837
I'll draw the money from the bank by
morning. You can collect in by noon.

777
01:25:54,008 --> 01:25:55,805
Fine. I'll take leave.

778
01:25:57,011 --> 01:25:58,979
Join me for a drink.

779
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:02,814
- To toast Fakira's death.
- Sure.

780
01:26:34,048 --> 01:26:40,009
Quiet. It's time for you to stop
laughing and him to start weeping.

781
01:27:02,076 --> 01:27:04,044
Swear by the Maker
take action fast!

782
01:27:05,079 --> 01:27:06,774
Or he'll butcher everybody!

783
01:27:18,092 --> 01:27:19,559
What a jump!

784
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,849
- Kill him!
- Just a minute.

785
01:27:49,123 --> 01:27:51,091
God will kill him not us.

786
01:27:52,126 --> 01:27:57,086
- How? - Tie bricks of cement to
each leg and throw him in the sea.

787
01:27:58,132 --> 01:28:02,091
No police inquiries nor
difficulties to hide the corpse.

788
01:28:11,145 --> 01:28:12,612
Throw him in.

789
01:28:22,156 --> 01:28:23,623
Let's go back.

790
01:28:36,170 --> 01:28:37,899
All four of you guard
this place for 24 hours.

791
01:28:38,172 --> 01:28:40,140
So that nobody can rescue the body.

792
01:28:51,185 --> 01:28:54,154
Spare me! Let me
bring his dead body out!

793
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:58,488
You killed Fakira?

794
01:28:59,193 --> 01:29:00,660
That's a terrible sin!

795
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:07,159
You were in prison so you don't
know how much he helps the poor.

796
01:29:08,202 --> 01:29:09,829
He is the saviour of the poor.

797
01:29:11,205 --> 01:29:13,901
That's terrible. But why
didn't you tell me earlier?

798
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:19,179
Well, he was Kunwar... Lots of cash...

799
01:29:24,218 --> 01:29:25,913
- Uncle...
- Yes?

800
01:29:27,221 --> 01:29:29,587
Take a look at this. It seems
to be a picture of my childhood

801
01:29:31,225 --> 01:29:32,692
Absolutely.

802
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:35,192
Then who is the other?

803
01:29:36,230 --> 01:29:38,198
Your brother, Vijay.

804
01:29:40,234 --> 01:29:41,701
My brother?

805
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:49,209
Could Fakira be my brother Vijay?

806
01:30:15,269 --> 01:30:17,237
Ouch! Help!

807
01:30:23,277 --> 01:30:24,744
Police! Help!

808
01:30:30,284 --> 01:30:32,252
Help! It bit me!

809
01:30:47,968 --> 01:30:50,095
- Are you Fakira's friend?
- Yes.

810
01:30:50,304 --> 01:30:52,272
Kill me! I won't
say a word in protest!

811
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:55,107
Fakira is not yet dead.
My Fakira is alive!

812
01:30:55,642 --> 01:30:58,133
- My Vijay is alive!
- Was Vijay, Fakira?

813
01:30:57,311 --> 01:30:58,938
He was my real brother!
My flesh and blood!

814
01:30:59,313 --> 01:31:01,281
- Your brother?
- Yes!

815
01:31:07,321 --> 01:31:09,289
Do you remember me? I'm Popat!

816
01:31:14,328 --> 01:31:16,159
I killed my own brother with
these very hands! Kill me!

817
01:31:17,331 --> 01:31:20,061
This is not the time to argue.
First try to save Vijay!

818
01:31:20,334 --> 01:31:22,894
- Only 7 minutes left.
- What does that mean? - Come with me!

819
01:31:30,344 --> 01:31:33,142
- Hurry up!
- Don't worry.

820
01:31:33,347 --> 01:31:36,316
Our brother does yoga.
He can hold his breath for 30 minutes.

821
01:31:37,351 --> 01:31:39,319
I plead with you to hurry!

822
01:31:44,358 --> 01:31:45,825
Stop! This is the spot!

823
01:31:51,365 --> 01:31:54,334
Lord, I never asked you for anything.

824
01:31:55,369 --> 01:31:58,736
For the first time in life I
beseech you to save my brother!

825
01:32:40,414 --> 01:32:41,881
Found anything?

826
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:43,883
Can't find anything.

827
01:32:44,418 --> 01:32:46,045
Just two minutes remain!

828
01:33:30,464 --> 01:33:32,432
Brother... brother!

829
01:33:35,469 --> 01:33:38,927
- He's not breathing.
- Everything will be fine.

830
01:33:40,474 --> 01:33:41,941
If something happens to him...

831
01:33:59,493 --> 01:34:00,960
Brother has regained consciousness!

832
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,123
God heard my prayers!

833
01:34:05,499 --> 01:34:07,126
Forgive me, brother!

834
01:34:07,501 --> 01:34:12,131
- Brother? - Yes, look at him.
Try to recognise. He's our Munna.

835
01:34:16,510 --> 01:34:19,809
For whom you would cry,
for whom you'd ache!

836
01:34:20,514 --> 01:34:23,483
Yes, I am that unfortunate
brother of yours.

837
01:34:25,018 --> 01:34:27,486
Here, this is our childhood picture.

838
01:35:31,585 --> 01:35:34,554
You were so close to me
yet you remained so far.

839
01:35:36,590 --> 01:35:39,320
I have committed many
blunders out of ignorance.

840
01:35:40,594 --> 01:35:42,221
I hit my elder brother!

841
01:35:42,429 --> 01:35:43,896
Beat me, brother! Punish me!

842
01:35:44,598 --> 01:35:48,557
Your punishment is that now
you will never leave me.

843
01:35:49,603 --> 01:35:52,902
Had Laxman left Rama
that I would leave you?

844
01:35:54,608 --> 01:35:57,907
My heart is at peace
now that now I've found you.

845
01:35:59,613 --> 01:36:04,243
But the childhood fire that
burned out father to death...

846
01:36:05,285 --> 01:36:07,412
It still rages in my heart.

847
01:36:08,622 --> 01:36:10,590
- Those people...
- who were they?

848
01:36:11,291 --> 01:36:13,589
Have you forgotten?
You too had hit them!

849
01:36:15,629 --> 01:36:17,927
I... don't recall anything.

850
01:36:19,633 --> 01:36:22,932
You were younger so you forgot.

851
01:36:24,304 --> 01:36:26,602
But I won't forget those killers.

852
01:36:27,641 --> 01:36:29,438
Those scoundrels were smugglers!

853
01:36:30,644 --> 01:36:32,612
And that is why I hate all smugglers!

854
01:36:33,647 --> 01:36:36,445
I searched for them high and low.

855
01:36:36,983 --> 01:36:37,950
But they were not to be found.

856
01:36:39,653 --> 01:36:42,281
Till I avenge the
death of my parents...

857
01:36:42,656 --> 01:36:45,625
- I won't rest in peace!
- You're not alone.

858
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:48,628
Both of us will join hands
to find those murderers!

859
01:36:49,663 --> 01:36:51,631
- Two? Why not three?
- Sure.

860
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:55,396
Your wife will be very
glad to hear about Ajay.

861
01:36:55,669 --> 01:36:57,466
Your wife? Where is she?

862
01:37:48,722 --> 01:37:51,020
The thighs I have to do for you!

863
01:37:51,725 --> 01:37:54,353
This stupid thief has ruined my plan!

864
01:37:56,730 --> 01:38:00,359
Let him enter. I'll teach him
a lesson that he'll forget his past!

865
01:38:12,746 --> 01:38:14,441
- Talk softly!
- How can I talk softly.

866
01:38:14,748 --> 01:38:17,546
You hit me so hard! Had you
hit my head, I would be dumb!

867
01:38:17,751 --> 01:38:20,720
- How did you escape the police?
- They were hoodlums not cops.

868
01:38:22,756 --> 01:38:26,055
- Why did you come here?
- Ban on visiting in-laws?

869
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:28,728
Not here!

870
01:38:29,763 --> 01:38:32,732
Where else? Fine, on the bed.

871
01:38:43,276 --> 01:38:44,743
What sound was that?

872
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:49,578
I was sleeping.
I was dreaming...

873
01:38:49,783 --> 01:38:53,241
- What about the voice?
- That's what I'm saying.

874
01:38:53,787 --> 01:38:55,254
Why are you holding the blanket?

875
01:38:56,790 --> 01:38:58,758
This too is related to the dream.

876
01:38:59,192 --> 01:39:01,592
- Funny dream.
- Absolutely.

877
01:39:02,796 --> 01:39:04,764
I dreamt that a thief is entering
the house through the balcony.

878
01:39:05,131 --> 01:39:07,759
He jumped in. I hit
him hard on his head.

879
01:39:08,301 --> 01:39:12,362
He screamed. Then I turned
and saw it was Vijay!

880
01:39:13,807 --> 01:39:15,775
- Where is he?
- In the dream.

881
01:39:16,810 --> 01:39:18,812
I met him. Then you came
and I pulled up the blanket!

882
01:39:18,812 --> 01:39:21,610
- Why are you holding it?
- You asked me that in the dream!

883
01:39:21,815 --> 01:39:24,818
I hurriedly told Vijay, Run!

884
01:39:24,818 --> 01:39:27,116
- Put the blanket down.
- Pardon?

885
01:39:29,823 --> 01:39:31,450
Even in the dream, you
yanked the blanket away!

886
01:39:34,494 --> 01:39:35,791
Move away!

887
01:39:41,835 --> 01:39:43,200
What's the matter?

888
01:39:44,838 --> 01:39:46,305
Nothing.

889
01:40:13,867 --> 01:40:15,835
- I'm going.
- Okay.

890
01:40:19,873 --> 01:40:21,340
Go to bed.

891
01:40:59,913 --> 01:41:01,278
What's going on?

892
01:41:02,916 --> 01:41:06,716
She's singing because she
can't fall asleep. Go to bed.

893
01:42:23,997 --> 01:42:25,294
But...

894
01:43:44,077 --> 01:43:46,045
What sound was that?

895
01:43:47,080 --> 01:43:49,048
Whatever it be!
You go to sleep!

896
01:43:55,088 --> 01:43:56,885
What's going on?

897
01:43:57,423 --> 01:44:01,052
Whatever is happening is right.

898
01:44:21,114 --> 01:44:22,672
It's daylight!

899
01:44:23,116 --> 01:44:24,583
Now what?

900
01:44:26,119 --> 01:44:27,586
Get up.

901
01:44:29,122 --> 01:44:30,487
Let me sleep.

902
01:44:31,124 --> 01:44:34,093
- It's bright day!
- Shut your eyes, it will turn dark.

903
01:44:36,129 --> 01:44:39,098
If your father-in-law finds out,
he'll send you to prison!

904
01:44:39,532 --> 01:44:40,829
And also thrash you.

905
01:44:42,135 --> 01:44:45,104
Nobody can thrash the
one you have blasted.

906
01:44:46,139 --> 01:44:48,107
Just get me some hot tea.

907
01:44:49,142 --> 01:44:53,602
Tea? If I call anyone up here...

908
01:44:54,147 --> 01:44:56,115
- What?
- Shut up and get up!

909
01:44:57,150 --> 01:44:59,118
I'll get up but I'm not leaving.

910
01:45:00,153 --> 01:45:02,121
I'll spend my honeymoon in this room.

911
01:45:03,156 --> 01:45:05,784
- I'll get out after 8 days.
- 8 days!

912
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:09,595
Not enough? We'll make it a fortnight

913
01:45:10,163 --> 01:45:13,132
- You don't know my Dad!
- Go on!

914
01:45:14,167 --> 01:45:16,465
When the couple are willing
the commissioner can't interfere.

915
01:45:17,170 --> 01:45:21,971
Quickly arrange for some breakfast
or I'll yell for the commissioner.

916
01:45:22,175 --> 01:45:24,803
- Shall I call him?
- Don't yell!

917
01:45:25,178 --> 01:45:26,805
Go into the bathroom.

918
01:45:30,183 --> 01:45:33,812
They got married.
Neeta was living with him.

919
01:45:35,188 --> 01:45:36,655
What must have happened then...

920
01:45:38,191 --> 01:45:40,557
Do you think any decent
boy will marry her now?

921
01:45:41,194 --> 01:45:43,492
Don't irritate me. We'll cross
that bridge when we come to it.

922
01:45:44,197 --> 01:45:45,494
Just do as I say.

923
01:45:47,200 --> 01:45:50,169
- Yes sir?
- Where are you taking this?

924
01:45:50,536 --> 01:45:52,561
Your daughter has asked for breakfast.

925
01:45:54,207 --> 01:45:57,005
Do you see that?
She's come to her senses.

926
01:45:58,211 --> 01:46:02,170
- But so much?
- She's ordered for double!

927
01:46:05,218 --> 01:46:08,585
What's so surprising?
She hasn't eaten anything for days.

928
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,186
Go ahead.

929
01:46:13,226 --> 01:46:17,788
- I'll go and see her.
- No, she's hungry.

930
01:46:18,231 --> 01:46:20,699
If you go up, another scene will ensue

931
01:46:21,234 --> 01:46:25,193
- Don't bother her.
- Okay, I'm going out.

932
01:46:25,738 --> 01:46:27,205
Ensure that she doesn't go out.

933
01:46:30,243 --> 01:46:34,043
Smells of clarified butter.
Does the commissioner accept bribes?

934
01:46:35,248 --> 01:46:37,876
My Daddy is a principled
and honest officer.

935
01:46:38,251 --> 01:46:41,550
Impossible! An honest man
can't afford oil these days.

936
01:46:42,255 --> 01:46:45,713
My grandfather was a landlord.
After him my Daddy owns the land.

937
01:46:46,259 --> 01:46:51,060
If you inherit your Daddy's wealth,
for the peace of our ancestors...

938
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,731
Distribute it among the poor.

939
01:46:54,267 --> 01:46:56,235
God Almighty... just a minute...

940
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:01,229
Okay, I'll do as you please.
Now eat and make a move.

941
01:47:02,275 --> 01:47:03,902
I'm not leaving!

942
01:47:04,277 --> 01:47:06,245
Won't Ajay and Popat be worried?

943
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:09,646
Are they little infants
to cry for their mother?

944
01:47:10,283 --> 01:47:13,081
They know the lover has gone to
his beloved with heart in hand...

945
01:47:13,286 --> 01:47:15,254
The exchange of hearts takes time.

946
01:48:44,377 --> 01:48:46,174
- What is the matter?
- He winked at me!

947
01:48:46,379 --> 01:48:48,176
My brother after all!

948
01:48:49,382 --> 01:48:51,350
Meaning you are a family of loafers.

949
01:48:52,385 --> 01:48:55,354
Now I'm just your chauffeur,

950
01:48:58,391 --> 01:49:00,359
It must be urgent if Ajay has come.

951
01:49:01,394 --> 01:49:02,952
I must leave.

952
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:08,196
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

953
01:49:11,904 --> 01:49:13,371
Hey! Listen...

954
01:49:30,423 --> 01:49:32,391
Where is the idol?

955
01:49:35,428 --> 01:49:38,056
This idol is 4000 years old.

956
01:49:41,434 --> 01:49:43,902
We risked our lives to steal it.

957
01:49:44,437 --> 01:49:47,406
In return you're getting
your price. Give me the box.

958
01:49:48,441 --> 01:49:52,400
No, not in this manner.
First give me 50000 bucks.

959
01:49:59,452 --> 01:50:02,910
- How did he come to life?
- To kill you!

960
01:50:19,305 --> 01:50:20,704
I don't understand anything.

961
01:50:22,475 --> 01:50:24,102
How did that twerp escape?

962
01:50:31,484 --> 01:50:35,443
You destroyed me.
He will destroy you.

963
01:50:35,655 --> 01:50:36,952
Shut up!

964
01:50:38,824 --> 01:50:43,284
If they don't pay in
Hong Kong for the idol...

965
01:50:43,829 --> 01:50:45,228
I will be ruined!

966
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:50,469
My last idea sir.

967
01:50:51,504 --> 01:50:55,463
My brain is turning stale.
Use it to your advantage.

968
01:50:55,908 --> 01:50:57,466
All right! What is it?

969
01:50:58,511 --> 01:51:02,470
You are a social worker,
the servant of the rich.

970
01:51:02,915 --> 01:51:04,974
That I am! But how does it help?

971
01:51:05,518 --> 01:51:08,078
Everything, my sir.

972
01:51:08,521 --> 01:51:12,981
Your private secretary will
inform all the newspapers...

973
01:51:13,526 --> 01:51:17,895
All the social workers
will present their...

974
01:51:18,531 --> 01:51:23,230
...leader Chimanbhai with a cake
made of gold on his 50th birthday.

975
01:51:23,536 --> 01:51:27,336
It will be adorned with
50 candles made of gold.

976
01:51:28,541 --> 01:51:34,502
Apart from the candles,
they will have 50 diamonds!

977
01:51:35,548 --> 01:51:36,913
We offer it to him.

978
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:41,008
The total worth will be 5 crores!

979
01:51:41,554 --> 01:51:43,522
What does that achieve?

980
01:51:44,056 --> 01:51:49,517
Don't you see? Fakira will
start drooling at this news.

981
01:51:50,563 --> 01:51:57,025
That's a large sum. He will
be drawn into our trap easily.

982
01:51:58,571 --> 01:52:00,869
Great! Bravo, my tiger!

983
01:52:01,574 --> 01:52:04,543
I'm sorry I didn't
identify a gem like you!

984
01:52:04,977 --> 01:52:07,275
Inform the press.
Arrange for the celebration.

985
01:52:07,580 --> 01:52:09,548
Wear it!

986
01:52:14,086 --> 01:52:16,884
Fakira will definitely
come for the gold and diamonds.

987
01:52:17,590 --> 01:52:19,057
Set the CID all around.

988
01:52:19,592 --> 01:52:21,389
Surround the hall.

989
01:52:21,994 --> 01:52:24,224
He must not escape
the eyes of the police!

990
01:52:26,599 --> 01:52:28,066
You will stay with us.

991
01:52:28,601 --> 01:52:30,569
But not in uniform.

992
01:52:32,605 --> 01:52:34,903
In the disguise of a signer.

993
01:52:35,608 --> 01:52:38,076
But there'll be lots of people!

994
01:52:38,611 --> 01:52:42,411
Yes but there will be singers
to entertain the public.

995
01:52:43,616 --> 01:52:45,083
I've fixed everything!

996
01:52:45,618 --> 01:52:47,586
I just have to fit things in!

997
01:52:48,120 --> 01:52:50,588
If that is fit, here goes!

998
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:54,593
Indication, the matter is a hit!

999
01:53:07,640 --> 01:53:12,270
The honour my brothers
have showered on me...

1000
01:53:13,646 --> 01:53:16,615
For that I am very...

1001
01:53:17,650 --> 01:53:19,277
- Grateful.
- I'm grateful.

1002
01:53:22,655 --> 01:53:24,122
Brothers and sisters...

1003
01:53:25,658 --> 01:53:28,218
Chimanbhai is our great leader.

1004
01:53:28,661 --> 01:53:31,960
He has been serving us for 30 years.

1005
01:53:32,665 --> 01:53:36,362
I hope he performs
his duties for ages.

1006
01:53:38,671 --> 01:53:43,472
On the 50th birthday of this great
man, my brothers and all of us...

1007
01:53:43,676 --> 01:53:45,143
...want to bestow a gift on him.

1008
01:53:45,678 --> 01:53:47,976
And there is the gift!

1009
01:53:49,682 --> 01:53:51,149
Bring it here.

1010
01:53:53,686 --> 01:53:56,655
Gently... carefully...

1011
01:53:59,692 --> 01:54:04,322
Brothers, this precious
treasure costing 5 crores...

1012
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:07,157
We present it to our leader!

1013
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:10,999
This guy seems to be Toofan.
Shall I pull off his beard?

1014
01:54:11,704 --> 01:54:13,672
We want Fakira, not Toofan!

1015
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:19,177
- Shall I grab his beard?
- Watch the drama.

1016
01:54:19,311 --> 01:54:20,505
I'll catch Fakira red handed.

1017
01:54:20,713 --> 01:54:22,180
Our men are spread all around.

1018
01:54:22,715 --> 01:54:25,081
Swear by the Maker,
they are all policemen!

1019
01:54:25,718 --> 01:54:29,677
Fear not. When his daughter
is ours, he is no match.

1020
01:54:30,222 --> 01:54:32,690
My chest expands with joy!

1021
01:54:33,726 --> 01:54:37,685
The love and honour
my town has bestowed on me...

1022
01:54:38,230 --> 01:54:40,198
I can never forget it!

1023
01:54:40,733 --> 01:54:46,694
I will spend all this money
for the welfare of my brethren!

1024
01:54:47,740 --> 01:54:50,368
- Chimanbhai!
- Long live!

1025
01:54:52,244 --> 01:54:55,213
You won't get a better
opportunity to fool the wealthy.

1026
01:54:55,748 --> 01:54:58,046
- What the?
- Brothers!

1027
01:54:58,751 --> 01:55:04,712
Seeing your pathetic condition,
my great leader's heart bleeds.

1028
01:55:05,758 --> 01:55:07,726
So he will auction his clothes!

1029
01:55:08,761 --> 01:55:12,720
He will spend the money
collected on the poor fellow men.

1030
01:55:16,769 --> 01:55:20,728
No, praise yourselves not me.

1031
01:55:21,774 --> 01:55:24,743
What humility! What love!

1032
01:55:25,778 --> 01:55:27,575
I'm floored by this love!

1033
01:55:28,180 --> 01:55:30,478
I bid a thousand for this cap!

1034
01:55:30,783 --> 01:55:32,751
- Is that all?
- Two thousand!

1035
01:55:33,786 --> 01:55:36,254
Nobody can cross me. 3000!

1036
01:55:36,789 --> 01:55:38,256
5000!

1037
01:55:39,291 --> 01:55:40,758
The fools swallowed the bait!

1038
01:55:41,794 --> 01:55:43,762
Pay the money there and take the cap.

1039
01:55:45,798 --> 01:55:53,534
And this is the shawl that our
leader wore in 1948 for his wedding!

1040
01:55:53,806 --> 01:55:55,774
- 5000!
- 5000??

1041
01:55:56,809 --> 01:56:01,371
How stupid! It costs
much more. Go beyond that.

1042
01:56:01,814 --> 01:56:04,783
If it's a matter of whom
the cap fits, I quote 15000.

1043
01:56:05,818 --> 01:56:07,445
Our bags will be full!

1044
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:10,288
I underestimated a gem like you!

1045
01:56:10,823 --> 01:56:14,782
Let me carry on.
Brothers! Bid for the shawl!

1046
01:56:15,828 --> 01:56:18,126
20000 diamond rings!

1047
01:56:18,831 --> 01:56:22,289
- 20000!!
- The shawl is yours!

1048
01:56:23,836 --> 01:56:25,531
- Sir
- What is it?

1049
01:56:25,838 --> 01:56:27,806
- Your shirt.
- No!

1050
01:56:36,248 --> 01:56:38,478
Observe his spirit of service.

1051
01:56:38,851 --> 01:56:41,649
He's giving the shirt off his back!

1052
01:56:45,858 --> 01:56:50,818
Shame on me! Why didn't I
stand for elections all this while?

1053
01:56:51,864 --> 01:56:57,325
It's never too late.
The shirt goes for 40000!

1054
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:59,838
Will anyone go beyond it?

1055
01:57:01,273 --> 01:57:03,741
This jewelry worth 50000!

1056
01:57:04,877 --> 01:57:07,505
I won't disappoint my fans.

1057
01:57:07,880 --> 01:57:10,348
- Give it to him.
- I want the dhoti!

1058
01:57:10,883 --> 01:57:13,181
What... Oh, sure!

1059
01:57:14,219 --> 01:57:15,846
Don't you dare touch it!

1060
01:57:18,891 --> 01:57:21,359
Your name will go down in history!

1061
01:57:21,894 --> 01:57:24,863
- I will be nude!
- But you're wearing your underwear!

1062
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:27,858
- Yes.
- Then take this off!

1063
01:57:30,903 --> 01:57:35,863
Your great leader has taken
his pants off for your welfare!

1064
01:57:36,909 --> 01:57:40,868
- 20000.
- What nonsense! I'll pay 25000!

1065
01:57:42,915 --> 01:57:48,876
This will go only to Rajasthan!
Write down a lakh from my wife!

1066
01:57:50,923 --> 01:57:53,483
A lakh! It is yours!

1067
01:57:56,261 --> 01:57:58,229
- Sir!
- Now what?

1068
01:57:58,931 --> 01:58:01,229
- Take off the underwear.
- No! - I say, take it off!

1069
01:58:01,934 --> 01:58:04,562
- No way!
- Take it off!

1070
01:58:05,938 --> 01:58:08,236
What a loss for an underwear!

1071
01:58:09,942 --> 01:58:13,742
Brothers and sisters,
to entertain you...

1072
01:58:14,446 --> 01:58:17,574
We present famous singers,
Sherali and Babbarali.

1073
01:58:18,951 --> 01:58:21,920
In opposition with them are...

1074
01:58:22,354 --> 01:58:24,413
Ustad Bhole and Bambhole!

1075
01:58:24,957 --> 01:58:26,652
Feeling very cold!

1076
01:58:26,959 --> 01:58:30,258
Sir, you have to face minor
difficulties in public service.

1077
01:58:31,964 --> 01:58:33,431
Shut up!

1078
02:04:27,319 --> 02:04:29,287
Nobody will leave!

1079
02:04:31,323 --> 02:04:32,950
Check the electricity!

1080
02:04:34,326 --> 02:04:35,793
Quietly be seated.

1081
02:04:37,329 --> 02:04:42,289
Where is my cake!
My candles! My diamonds!

1082
02:04:43,335 --> 02:04:46,304
The cash and jewelry of the auction...
All gone! Fakira has taken it!

1083
02:04:48,340 --> 02:04:51,707
The scoundrel made me nude in public!

1084
02:04:52,344 --> 02:04:56,303
But sir, I gave the idea
for your advantage.

1085
02:04:56,748 --> 02:05:00,309
To my advantage or so that
everybody could focus on me.

1086
02:05:00,685 --> 02:05:02,152
And Fakira could steal everything!

1087
02:05:02,754 --> 02:05:06,087
I thought you were smart!
You have ruined me!

1088
02:05:06,691 --> 02:05:08,318
Forgive me!

1089
02:05:09,361 --> 02:05:13,821
Put him in the pool all night.
He'll die of cold by morning.

1090
02:05:14,366 --> 02:05:16,061
Take him away! Stop!

1091
02:05:17,369 --> 02:05:20,930
- Take off my ring!
- That's the only thing left!

1092
02:05:21,373 --> 02:05:22,670
- Let it be.
- Take him away!

1093
02:05:23,375 --> 02:05:24,672
Sir!

1094
02:05:34,386 --> 02:05:38,186
I'll see how that rascal
Fakira escapes my clutches!

1095
02:05:47,399 --> 02:05:50,197
- Who is speaking?
- Neeta here.

1096
02:05:52,404 --> 02:05:55,373
I'm calling on behalf of
Vijay. He has said...

1097
02:05:56,408 --> 02:05:59,377
Reach Tulsi Lake at 5 in the evening

1098
02:05:59,911 --> 02:06:01,378
I'll be there.

1099
02:06:04,816 --> 02:06:08,377
Let me lay my hands on him,
Then I'll see...

1100
02:06:09,821 --> 02:06:12,381
I wish I had thought of this earlier.

1101
02:07:40,512 --> 02:07:43,481
Every dog has his day.

1102
02:07:44,516 --> 02:07:47,815
We have the upper hand now.
Your beloved is in our custody.

1103
02:07:48,520 --> 02:07:52,320
To set accounts right,
be at the old airport at 3.

1104
02:07:53,525 --> 02:07:56,153
If you act smart,
you won't find her corpse.

1105
02:08:09,541 --> 02:08:11,839
Have you brought all the loot?

1106
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:16,002
You can count it after
you hand Neeta over to me.

1107
02:08:16,281 --> 02:08:19,842
- I trust you.
- But I don't trust you.

1108
02:08:20,552 --> 02:08:24,010
How can you trust me?
The ache of separation hurts.

1109
02:08:25,557 --> 02:08:28,025
It's only a question of 15 minutes.

1110
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:33,520
Then it will be her
beautiful arms and you.

1111
02:08:34,566 --> 02:08:36,864
It must be great to
hold her in your arms.

1112
02:08:39,571 --> 02:08:42,369
Wrestlers like you can't know that.

1113
02:08:46,578 --> 02:08:48,546
Hurry! Faster!

1114
02:08:51,583 --> 02:08:53,210
We're close to the place.

1115
02:08:57,589 --> 02:09:00,558
Look down there!
Neeta is with my men!

1116
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:09,567
Turn the plane and
bring it back to this spot.

1117
02:09:12,604 --> 02:09:15,072
If you harm my brother,
I'll kill you!

1118
02:09:15,607 --> 02:09:18,405
- Why did he enter the plane?
- Even I don't understand that!

1119
02:09:19,611 --> 02:09:21,579
Where is the plane gone?

1120
02:09:24,616 --> 02:09:26,982
- Turn right. - Why?
- The needle says so!

1121
02:09:27,285 --> 02:09:28,912
Tie this parachute and jump down.

1122
02:09:29,621 --> 02:09:33,182
- My loot...
- First the parachute.

1123
02:09:34,626 --> 02:09:38,426
Listen. As soon as Fakira jumps...

1124
02:09:39,631 --> 02:09:43,931
Be alert.
His body should hit the ground.

1125
02:09:46,638 --> 02:09:50,096
- Come on, hurry!
- Hail Lord Hanuman!

1126
02:09:50,642 --> 02:09:52,610
Help! Help!

1127
02:09:55,647 --> 02:09:58,616
- Let go of me!
- Should I? No!

1128
02:09:59,651 --> 02:10:01,118
Don't let go of me!

1129
02:10:02,654 --> 02:10:04,622
Boss is with him? Don't fire!

1130
02:10:14,666 --> 02:10:17,635
Where's my bag? Yes, it's here!

1131
02:10:26,678 --> 02:10:28,976
Don't let go of this dog!
Else they will shoot you!

1132
02:10:29,180 --> 02:10:30,647
Stop!

1133
02:10:31,683 --> 02:10:33,651
Throw down your guns!

1134
02:10:34,185 --> 02:10:36,483
Or I'll shoot out his brains!

1135
02:10:38,690 --> 02:10:40,385
Throw your guns.

1136
02:10:41,693 --> 02:10:43,422
Now tell me, where Neeta is.

1137
02:10:43,695 --> 02:10:47,654
- She is inside.
- He's lying! She's not in.

1138
02:10:48,700 --> 02:10:51,669
She doesn't know. I'll
locked her in the dungeon!

1139
02:10:52,103 --> 02:10:53,661
He's playing a trick!

1140
02:10:54,706 --> 02:10:58,198
Answer me truthfully
or I'll have to kill you!

1141
02:10:58,710 --> 02:11:01,008
- Answer!
- All right.

1142
02:11:01,713 --> 02:11:05,672
I've tied her inside the effigy
of Ravana in the Ramleela ground.

1143
02:11:06,718 --> 02:11:08,686
So that she gets burnt with it.

1144
02:11:09,721 --> 02:11:12,690
Burnt? You are the devil incarnate!

1145
02:11:13,725 --> 02:11:16,193
I'll kill you before she dies!

1146
02:11:17,729 --> 02:11:22,029
Don't kill me. There are two
hours before Ravana is set aflame.

1147
02:11:22,734 --> 02:11:24,702
We can reach in an hour.

1148
02:11:25,136 --> 02:11:27,604
- Come on.
- Get the car.

1149
02:11:34,746 --> 02:11:36,043
Drive the car.

1150
02:11:38,750 --> 02:11:40,217
- Vijay!
- Stop the car!

1151
02:11:44,756 --> 02:11:46,121
Get the bag.

1152
02:11:49,761 --> 02:11:52,229
Got the loot and the enemy is no more.

1153
02:11:54,766 --> 02:11:56,734
Full of stones!

1154
02:11:58,770 --> 02:12:01,398
Got the loot? Want to
square up the account?

1155
02:12:01,773 --> 02:12:06,608
I'll settle scores in such a way
that your soul will shudder!

1156
02:12:07,111 --> 02:12:08,738
If you don't tell me
where the loot is...

1157
02:12:09,180 --> 02:12:10,738
You'll die here and
she'll die there!

1158
02:12:29,801 --> 02:12:31,268
All arrangements fine?

1159
02:12:37,809 --> 02:12:40,744
There's still time.
Tell me where my loot is!

1160
02:12:40,812 --> 02:12:42,279
Never will I tell you!

1161
02:12:43,815 --> 02:12:46,113
You won't give in
so easily. Wrestler!

1162
02:12:46,818 --> 02:12:48,115
Dance!

1163
02:12:50,221 --> 02:12:53,190
Your steps will take him
closer to death!

1164
02:12:53,825 --> 02:12:58,785
Don't just watch. Beat her
till she starts dancing!

1165
02:14:30,922 --> 02:14:32,389
Look there!

1166
02:15:05,957 --> 02:15:07,754
What have you done!

1167
02:15:09,961 --> 02:15:16,264
Forget it. I've been
punished for my sins.

1168
02:15:21,973 --> 02:15:23,702
Time is short.

1169
02:15:25,643 --> 02:15:28,441
Go and save Neeta.

1170
02:15:44,996 --> 02:15:46,463
Hands up!

1171
02:15:54,005 --> 02:15:56,633
I've been released from
prison after 20 years.

1172
02:15:57,008 --> 02:15:59,306
But I've come just in time.

1173
02:16:15,026 --> 02:16:16,994
No! You won't escape alive!

1174
02:16:18,029 --> 02:16:22,830
The murderer of my father!
You ruined my family!

1175
02:16:23,034 --> 02:16:24,729
I won't spare you alive!

1176
02:16:26,037 --> 02:16:29,336
My father died in the fire he lit!

1177
02:16:30,041 --> 02:16:33,499
He slapped me hard to give me
money for my mother's medicines!

1178
02:16:34,045 --> 02:16:36,013
He's the one who stole our joys!

1179
02:16:37,048 --> 02:16:41,678
Kill him! I'm burning in the
flames set by him years ago!

1180
02:16:42,053 --> 02:16:44,021
Let go! You rascal!

1181
02:17:04,075 --> 02:17:07,533
Let go of my leg and hold my hand.

1182
02:17:22,093 --> 02:17:25,551
Baldie! What's wrong?

1183
02:17:27,098 --> 02:17:28,565
What's the matter?

1184
02:17:34,105 --> 02:17:36,573
So you're the children of that master?

1185
02:17:38,109 --> 02:17:41,078
Good. You were all fated
to die at my hands!

1186
02:17:42,113 --> 02:17:45,913
You dog! Had I known you were
responsible for our ruin...

1187
02:17:46,450 --> 02:17:48,077
I wouldn't have let you live!

1188
02:17:50,121 --> 02:17:53,090
I won't commit the same mistake.

1189
02:17:55,126 --> 02:17:56,753
Kill this rogue!

1190
02:17:57,128 --> 02:17:59,426
You dog! You will die not him!

1191
02:18:20,151 --> 02:18:23,882
I'm returning the money you
gave for my mother's medication!

1192
02:18:24,155 --> 02:18:25,622
Take this money!

1193
02:18:26,157 --> 02:18:27,522
Take this!

1194
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:31,628
And this!

1195
02:18:36,167 --> 02:18:38,397
Isn't this how you killed my Dad?

1196
02:18:53,184 --> 02:18:56,153
I'll make mincemeat of you! Brother!

1197
02:18:59,190 --> 02:19:00,657
You look after him.

1198
02:19:05,196 --> 02:19:07,164
I'll ruin you!

1199
02:19:07,531 --> 02:19:09,829
Here is that ungrateful wretch!

1200
02:19:13,704 --> 02:19:15,171
Catch them! Let none escape!

1201
02:20:23,674 --> 02:20:26,643
Now if you raise your head,
I'll snap your neck!

1202
02:20:40,291 --> 02:20:43,260
They are going to light
the effigies. Hurry up.

1203
02:21:04,315 --> 02:21:06,943
Hail Lord Rama!

1204
02:21:15,326 --> 02:21:17,294
Stop! Who is this fool?

1205
02:21:19,730 --> 02:21:21,288
Arrest him!

1206
02:21:30,341 --> 02:21:32,309
Neeta! My child!

1207
02:21:32,676 --> 02:21:34,974
- Move out, sir!
- Get out!

1208
02:21:38,349 --> 02:21:39,976
I have come!

1209
02:21:53,364 --> 02:21:55,332
Don't worry. I'm on my way!

1210
02:21:58,369 --> 02:21:59,996
Don't be scared. I'm almost there.

1211
02:23:05,436 --> 02:23:08,735
I... I am bound by the law.

1212
02:23:11,442 --> 02:23:13,740
Chimanlal is the real
culprit, not him!

1213
02:23:16,113 --> 02:23:19,412
- What? - See for yourself
if you don't trust me.

1214
02:23:19,950 --> 02:23:21,417
He is lying unconscious in the car.

1215
02:23:38,469 --> 02:23:41,097
If anyone comes towards me,
I'll kill them!

1216
02:24:17,508 --> 02:24:18,805
Stop!

1217
02:24:32,523 --> 02:24:33,820
Handcuff him.

1218
02:24:44,535 --> 02:24:48,164
Swear by the Maker,
our young one is here!

1219
02:24:51,542 --> 02:24:55,171
No, brother. I'll hold him
while you may hold her.

1220
02:24:56,547 --> 02:24:59,175
I don't think I should
break Popat's heart.

1221
02:24:59,550 --> 02:25:01,518
Sweet little baby.

1222
02:25:02,553 --> 02:25:04,350
Grandpa is here!

1223
02:25:05,556 --> 02:25:07,285
Grandpa is here! Good day sir.

1224
02:25:10,561 --> 02:25:12,028
Live long, son.

1225
02:25:15,065 --> 02:25:16,532
What's wrong?

1226
02:25:17,568 --> 02:25:19,195
What happened to Munna?

1227
02:25:20,571 --> 02:25:22,539
What's wrong with him?

1228
02:25:25,576 --> 02:25:28,875
- How's that?
- Good.

1229
02:25:29,246 --> 02:25:31,544
He'll be one up on you.

1230
02:25:32,983 --> 02:25:34,541
My Junior Fakira!
