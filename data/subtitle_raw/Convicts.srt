1
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:33,064
<i>Don't let him get away.</i>

2
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,666
Come on.

3
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:41,805
- Here. Come on now.
- Move it!

4
00:00:47,947 --> 00:00:49,107
Martha.

5
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:58,917
- Are you awake?
- I am now.

6
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:00,755
You hear them hounds?

7
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:04,858
<i>They're running after that
convict that's trying to get away.</i>

8
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,727
Reckon so.

9
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:12,871
Keep going, fellas!

10
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,570
Move it out, god damn it.

11
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:21,011
Hold on.

12
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,443
Move!

13
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,345
<i>Come on, y'all.</i>

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,617
<i>God damn it! Move it out! I
don't want to lose that thing.</i>

15
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,792
<i>Come on now. Let's get him!</i>

16
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:39,764
Ben.

17
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,730
<i>- They're shooting.
- I hear them.</i>

18
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,801
- You think they killed him?
- God knows.

19
00:01:48,908 --> 00:01:51,706
<i>It's quiet now. Go back to sleep.</i>

20
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,817
<i>Asa, why aren't those convicts
out in the field working?</i>

21
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,411
God only knows.

22
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,494
<i>We'll head back to town as
soon as we finish up here.</i>

23
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,999
<i>- Give me a drink of that whiskey.
- As soon as I've finished.</i>

24
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:03,846
<i>Before we go back to town, I have
to stop by my papa's plantation.</i>

25
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:05,179
What for?

26
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,218
<i>I like to check on things
out there when he's gone.</i>

27
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,090
<i>- Look at that guard over there.
- What's going on around here?</i>

28
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:39,884
<i>I expect we'll be coming out here
before too long for Uncle Soll's funeral.</i>

29
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,580
<i>Well, the old buzzard can't
last many more Christmases.</i>

30
00:03:44,924 --> 00:03:48,451
<i>Well, you've been saying that
for the last five Christmases.</i>

31
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,301
<i>I'll go see if he's inside.</i>

32
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,373
<i>Don't be long.</i>

33
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,252
Mr. Soll.

34
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,333
Nowhere around.

35
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:42,909
Goddamn Christmas will
be ruined for sure now.

36
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,389
<i>I'll be right out.</i>

37
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,099
Hurry up now.

38
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,331
- Martha.
- Good morning, Mr. Billy.

39
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,070
<i>- Where is Horace?
- He's gone fishing.</i>

40
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,676
<i>- Where is Mr. Soll?
- He's around someplace.</i>

41
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,849
He sent for the sheriff.

42
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,388
One of them convicts killed
another one and run off.

43
00:05:24,457 --> 00:05:26,755
They got the rest locked
up there in the quarters...

44
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,817
to keep them from fighting
amongst themselves.

45
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:32,695
<i>Is that why it's so quiet around
here? No one out in the fields.</i>

46
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,758
I thought maybe he gave the convicts
the day off because of Christmas Eve.

47
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,930
<i>You know Mr. Soll don't
give nobody no time off.</i>

48
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,933
<i>He'll work them Christmas
Day, too. Always has.</i>

49
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,874
<i>The only reason that they
ain't out in the fields now...</i>

50
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,881
<i>is so the trouble won't spread.</i>

51
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,112
<i>Oh, my God. I don't know what
Horace's people are thinking about...</i>

52
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,280
letting him work out in
this godforsaken place.

53
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,925
Would you go see if
you could find him?

54
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,692
Yes, sir.

55
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,873
Martha, where the hell are you going?

56
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,501
- Trying to find Horace.
- What?

57
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,229
- You seen Horace?
- Not for a spell.

58
00:06:40,099 --> 00:06:44,729
If you see him, tell him Mr. Billy Vaughn
is looking for him up there at the store.

59
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,396
You all right?

60
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,419
<i>I can't find him. Ben
hasn't seen him either.</i>

61
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:08,159
<i>- Give me some more whiskey.
- That's all I have.</i>

62
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:12,155
<i>I'm going up to Uncle
Soll's and get me some more.</i>

63
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,310
Horace, where you been?

64
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,410
I been down to the field where
they found the dead convict.

65
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,945
Well, Mr. Billy wants you to
go into Harrison for Christmas.

66
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,788
<i>I won't leave until
Mr. Soll gets back.</i>

67
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,358
<i>He told me yesterday
that he'd pay me today.</i>

68
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:46,193
<i>And he told you the day before
that he'd pay you yesterday.</i>

69
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,426
- Did he do it?
- No.

70
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,971
<i>I wouldn't be wasting my breath
waiting on him to pay you today.</i>

71
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,742
<i>I don't want to go
until I get my money.</i>

72
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,006
<i>There's still no tombstone
on my daddy's grave...</i>

73
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,207
and I want to make a
down payment on one.

74
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,742
<i>It worries me to death that there's
still no tombstone on my daddy's grave.</i>

75
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,088
<i>- How much do you think one'd cost me?
- I don't know.</i>

76
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:15,616
<i>Ain't your folks gonna be angry if
you don't get home for Christmas Day?</i>

77
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,425
<i>- My folks don't care what I do.
- Yes, they do.</i>

78
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,326
<i>- Sure they do.
- No, they don't.</i>

79
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,695
<i>My daddy cared, but he's dead.</i>

80
00:08:25,771 --> 00:08:28,672
I saw the grave they buried
the murdered convict in.

81
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,775
They got no marker on
it. What was his name?

82
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:34,040
<i>I don't know what his name is. I
don't be studying them convicts.</i>

83
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,945
Horace!

84
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,922
Coming, Ben.

85
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,191
<i>I'm tired of waiting here. Take
the gun and watch him for a spell...</i>

86
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,198
<i>while I go inside. It won't be long.</i>

87
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,734
Stay way over here out
the reach of his chain.

88
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:59,168
<i>Whatever you do, don't let
him get a hold of that gun.</i>

89
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:00,964
<i>I won't.</i>

90
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,940
What was the name of the
convict that was killed?

91
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,609
<i>- I don't know.
- Think he knows?</i>

92
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:09,540
<i>I don't know.</i>

93
00:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,549
Was there any prayers
said over his grave?

94
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:12,948
No, now you know Mr. Soll.

95
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,045
<i>He ain't gonna have no prayer
said over no dead convict's grave.</i>

96
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,317
<i>Who'll say them? Mr. Soll?</i>

97
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,757
<i>Ain't no preacher out
here. Nobody but Mr. Soll...</i>

98
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:24,193
and the Overseer and the guards
and you and me and the convicts.

99
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,424
<i>You been out here a
long time, haven't you?</i>

100
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,796
I was born out here.

101
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:31,428
Right at the end of slavery time.
My mama and papa are buried out here.

102
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,369
Our cabin used to
be right over yonder.

103
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,670
My mama and papa stayed on to work
for wages after the slavery time.

104
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,711
A lot of the old folks did.
When they commenced to die off...

105
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,942
Mr. Soll brought in the
convicts to work the place.

106
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:48,048
Can I talk to the convict?

107
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,249
I guess you can. He may
not want to talk to you.

108
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:10,807
<i>Well, they chain us together
And we started cutting cane</i>

109
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,809
<i>I wish you were here Way back then...</i>

110
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,750
Good morning, convicts.

111
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,825
I said good morning, god damn it.

112
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,885
Did any of you see Nancy?

113
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:36,167
<i>I been looking all over this
damn plantation. I can't find her.</i>

114
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,610
<i>I wonder where the
hell she's gone to.</i>

115
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,879
I been looking all morning.

116
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,132
Hey, convict...

117
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,839
you want a chew of tobacco?

118
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:26,084
Convict, you asleep?

119
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:30,547
<i>If you're asleep, I won't bother you.</i>

120
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,457
<i>I ain't asleep.</i>

121
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,685
<i>It's too cold on this
ground to go to sleep.</i>

122
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,522
- You want a chew of tobacco?
- Pass it along.

123
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,269
Throw me a knife.

124
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,538
<i>I ain't got nothing to cut it with.</i>

125
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,943
<i>You'll have to bite it off.
I can't give you a knife.</i>

126
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,435
<i>My name's Horace. What's yours?</i>

127
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:21,006
Leroy Kendricks.

128
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,405
A lot of Kendricks down in Kendleton.

129
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,410
Ever been to Kendleton?

130
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,770
No...

131
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:29,645
<i>I don't even know where it's at.</i>

132
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,580
Everyone that lives there is colored.

133
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,883
<i>I still ain't never been.</i>

134
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,785
Where do you come from?

135
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,689
I come from down round Louisiana.

136
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,651
<i>How'd you get up here?</i>

137
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,593
I got into a fight with a man.

138
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,660
Cut him.

139
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:53,436
Anyway, they sentenced me to Retrieve
Prison Plantation on the Coast.

140
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,165
<i>That's the worst place
I ever been in my life.</i>

141
00:12:57,243 --> 00:13:02,112
I heard that you could hire off to
work on plantations around here...

142
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,713
you know, to work out your fine.

143
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:09,548
So I asked them if I
could work out my fine.

144
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,656
And they sent me here.

145
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,622
Well, I hope Mr. Soll pays you.

146
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,421
How much is your fine?

147
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,389
About $500.

148
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:25,032
They pay me $7 a month or they pay
the State for me to pay off my fine.

149
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,240
- How long you been here?
- About a year.

150
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:33,571
How long are you gonna have to work
at $7 a month to pay off your fine?

151
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:37,580
<i>- I don't know. They didn't tell me.
- Didn't you figure it out?</i>

152
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,674
Figure it out?

153
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,113
How am I supposed to figure it out?

154
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,983
<i>- Just figure it out.
- I don't know how.</i>

155
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,988
<i>- Didn't you go to school?
- No.</i>

156
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,695
<i>I ain't never been to no school.</i>

157
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,729
Never?

158
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:58,233
No.

159
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,399
<i>I'm doing some figuring in my head.</i>

160
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,643
Comes to almost six
years to pay off $500.

161
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:12,215
<i>- It's gonna be more than that now.
- What do you mean?</i>

162
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,517
I done killed me a man now.

163
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,454
What was his name?

164
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,521
Jesse.

165
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,259
Jesse what?

166
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,761
Jesse Wilkes.

167
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,162
Got a brother here, too.

168
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:34,165
<i>Brother say that he gonna kill me
if the white sheriff don't kill me.</i>

169
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,505
Are you scared of him?

170
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,141
<i>- No.
- What's his name?</i>

171
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,474
Name is Sherman.

172
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:45,882
Sherman Edwards.

173
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,944
<i>How can they be brothers if
one's Edwards and one's Wilkes?</i>

174
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,483
They got the same mama, but
they got a different daddy.

175
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:56,289
- He got a white man for a Daddy.
- Who does?

176
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,292
Sherman Edwards.

177
00:14:59,598 --> 00:15:04,501
<i>See, now that's why he's so
mean. It's the white blood in him.</i>

178
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,038
See, now he kill you,
too, if he had the chance.

179
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,974
<i>Being as he is. He
don't like white people.</i>

180
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,441
I asked him, I say...

181
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:17,471
<i>"How come you don't like white people
when you're half white yourself?"</i>

182
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,344
<i>But he didn't answer that.</i>

183
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,813
He just cussed me.

184
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,562
You give me that knife, I
just might cut my own throat.

185
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,496
Save somebody else the trouble.
Can you give me that knife?

186
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,628
No.

187
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,674
- Give me another chew of tobacco?
- Sure.

188
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,379
Keep it.

189
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,257
If I gave you this knife...

190
00:16:06,365 --> 00:16:08,731
would you really try
and kill yourself?

191
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,868
Give it to me and see.

192
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,366
<i>I couldn't kill myself.</i>

193
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:18,641
<i>Well, you ain't waiting in
chains for no white sheriff.</i>

194
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,576
<i>I couldn't do that.
I'm afraid to die.</i>

195
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:24,474
<i>You're not afraid of dying?</i>

196
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,115
No.

197
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,384
Where you going?

198
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:40,793
<i>Just going over there. To say
a prayer over Jesse's grave.</i>

199
00:16:52,244 --> 00:16:54,872
<i>- Dib, take the sheriff's horse.
- Yes, sir.</i>

200
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:57,582
<i>The convict's over
yonder by the tree.</i>

201
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,878
<i>Leroy, do you know the Lord's Prayer?</i>

202
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:06,556
<i>- No.
- I've forgotten the last part of it.</i>

203
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:10,020
<i>- Ben, do you know the Lord's Prayer?
- Yes, I do.</i>

204
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,698
<i>What comes after "forgive
us our trespasses"?</i>

205
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,562
<i>No, I can't say it that way.
Got to start from the beginning.</i>

206
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,830
<i>"Our Father who art in
Heaven, hallowed be thy name.</i>

207
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:21,771
<i>"Thy kingdom come, thy
will be done on earth...</i>

208
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,468
<i>"Forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those...</i>

209
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,477
<i>"who trespass against us..."</i>

210
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:30,379
- There he is. Sheriff. Right there.
- You the one? Who got the keys?

211
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,910
Right here.

212
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:35,280
Ben, how many throats did
this devil slit last night?

213
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,281
Only one, sir.

214
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,253
- But was he colored or white?
- They all colored, sir.

215
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,056
<i>Now get up or I'll kill you.</i>

216
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,213
Mr. Soll?

217
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,383
<i>You told me yesterday that
you'd pay me my wages today, sir.</i>

218
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,649
You work for me?

219
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,714
Now you know, Mr.
Soll, he works for you.

220
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:16,627
- Did I ask you a question?
- No, sir.

221
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,526
Then you keep quiet until I do.

222
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,327
- Shoot.
- Why do you say that?

223
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,197
<i>'Cause I'm disgusted.</i>

224
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:27,600
<i>This poor boy out here working to get
a tombstone for his daddy's grave...</i>

225
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:31,109
<i>and he been here six months and
you ain't paid him nothing yet.</i>

226
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,670
<i>Go up to the house in
a while. I'll pay you.</i>

227
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:38,914
<i>Think he's gonna do it?</i>

228
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:42,112
<i>I wouldn't waste holding
my breath if I was you.</i>

229
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,282
Lord Jesus, have mercy, God.

230
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:15,113
Lord, they killing each other.

231
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:19,214
<i>Someday all of them convicts gonna get
loose and we're gonna all be killed.</i>

232
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,458
Get your shovel. Go
dig a grave for him.

233
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:33,730
<i>I'll send Jackson
over there to help you.</i>

234
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,174
Boy, you go watch the body
until we get his grave dug.

235
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:43,043
<i>- Sir, I wouldn't care to see him right now.
- Why?</i>

236
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,946
<i>Because he's dead, sir.</i>

237
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:49,118
You never seen a dead man before,
boy? Nothing to worry yourself about.

238
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,779
<i>Sir, I just don't want to see him...</i>

239
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,587
<i>- Suppose I told you, you had to do it, boy.
- He don't have to do it. I'll do it.</i>

240
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,255
<i>What're you doing here? You're supposed
to be cooking my Christmas dinner.</i>

241
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,457
<i>This ain't Christmas Day yet.</i>

242
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,558
<i>- What the hell day is it?
- It's Christmas Eve.</i>

243
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,863
All right.

244
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,469
Lord. Jesus.

245
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,109
That convict tried
to kill me, you know.

246
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:16,543
- Which one?
- The one the sheriff just shot.

247
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:20,274
- He really dead, Martha?
- Yes, sir.

248
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:23,349
- The white one or colored one?
- You saw him.

249
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:26,085
Well, I forget.

250
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,326
Come see for yourself.

251
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,592
I forget.

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,800
<i>He tried to kill me, he did.
He won't have a chance anymore.</i>

253
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,404
Colored or white. Crazy old fool.

254
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,237
Lord, you know.

255
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,245
Martha, you afraid of dying?

256
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:52,279
<i>No, I ain't afraid of it.
Just not ready to go yet.</i>

257
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,744
<i>- Where is Mr. Soll?
- He's over there by the body.</i>

258
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:58,619
- He says he tried to kill him.
- Might have.

259
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:01,887
Jackson, he listens to you.
Tell him to give me my money.

260
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,190
<i>- He don't listen to me.
- Jackson!</i>

261
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,563
Tell Martha to get in the house and
start cooking my Christmas dinner.

262
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:12,226
<i>- You hear that, Martha?
- Tell him today ain't Christmas.</i>

263
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:15,372
<i>She say today ain't Christmas.</i>

264
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,655
- Did you bury him?
- Yes, I did.

265
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,027
<i>Right next to the
other convicts' graves.</i>

266
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:21,966
Mr. Soll say any convicts
that die gets buried out here.

267
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,099
<i>He don't want them next
to his peoples' graves.</i>

268
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,509
<i>I don't want them next
to mine. In my graveyard.</i>

269
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,109
My mama and papa buried out there.

270
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:33,079
<i>My sister's buried out
there. And her baby.</i>

271
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,380
Howdy, Mr. Billy.

272
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,219
Good morning, Mr. Soll.

273
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,756
- Is he dead?
- Dead drunk.

274
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,867
<i>Who's that on the ground?</i>

275
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:52,629
<i>Mr. Billy Vaughn. He's drunk.</i>

276
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,869
I thought he was
another dead convict.

277
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,910
- Lot of them out here now.
- How many?

278
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:03,011
<i>God knows. Always room for
one more, though, ain't it?</i>

279
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:07,017
<i>I'm a convict, you know. They made me
a trustee so I can walk about free...</i>

280
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,347
<i>but I'm still a convict.</i>

281
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,149
- Is that a convict?
- No.

282
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,786
- Who the hell is it?
- Who it look like?

283
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,153
Wake up, Billy.

284
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:23,631
<i>The son of a bitch is
drunk. Billy's drunk.</i>

285
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,274
- Where you taking him to?
- Over to the house.

286
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:36,838
Did Overseer get them convicts back
out in the field like I told him to?

287
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,975
<i>- All but one.
- Why isn't he out in the fields?</i>

288
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:43,016
<i>- He's sick.
- What the hell's wrong with him?</i>

289
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,155
<i>I don't know. You have to ask him.</i>

290
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:49,360
Boy, come here.

291
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:54,023
Tell that Overseer to get that
convict out in the field with the rest.

292
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,726
<i>- Yes, sir.
- Don't go over there.</i>

293
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:56,927
<i>What'd you say, woman?</i>

294
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,334
I told him not to go over
where them convicts live.

295
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,237
<i>- Let Jackson, Ben go over there.
- I'll go, god damn it.</i>

296
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:03,968
Then you go over there.

297
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,272
<i>You think I'm scared of
any goddamn sick convict?</i>

298
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:10,610
<i>I'm scared of no goddamn convict,
sick or well. I'll go over there.</i>

299
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,283
<i>- He ain't gonna be sick long now.
- Which one is it?</i>

300
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,816
The brother to the
one that got killed.

301
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,751
<i>- What if he is sick?
- Ain't gonna help him.</i>

302
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:27,231
Gonna have to work out in
the fields just the same.

303
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,200
<i>Mr. Soll didn't bring
him here to get sick.</i>

304
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:36,439
<i>- You know Mr. Billy Vaughn's divorced?
- Yes.</i>

305
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,239
<i>What happens if you're not
divorced, but your first wife dies...</i>

306
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,007
and then you marry again?

307
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,345
When you go to heaven, which
woman do you claim as your wife?

308
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,907
<i>I don't know.</i>

309
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:48,776
Take Sherman Edwards.

310
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:52,217
<i>He's got a white daddy
and a colored mama.</i>

311
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:55,287
<i>Now when they all go to heaven
together, what's gonna happen?</i>

312
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,794
How would I know all that, Horace?

313
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,829
I worry about things like this.

314
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,798
<i>'Cause my daddy died and now my
mama's married to another man.</i>

315
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,335
<i>Got to wondering last night, who's
gonna be her husband in heaven.</i>

316
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,011
Kept me awake half the night.

317
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,411
<i>Read the Bible. All that's
in the Bible someplace.</i>

318
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:26,847
Keep moving.

319
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:31,757
Gotcha.

320
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,430
I love pecan pie.

321
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,702
<i>There's a boy out here says I owe
him some money, Ben. You pay him.</i>

322
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:42,968
What am I gonna pay him
with? I have no money.

323
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:46,638
- Take it out of the cash at the store.
- What cash?

324
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,509
<i>You know everybody's been
buying on credit since October.</i>

325
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:52,072
- Everybody?
- How else they gonna buy?

326
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,212
- I got a lot of money, you know.
- I know you do.

327
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,116
<i>- Where'd the hell I put my money?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

328
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,327
When you find it, or I find it...

329
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,420
<i>I'm gonna pay the boy.
Now you tell him that.</i>

330
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,227
- You tell him. There he is right there.
- Where?

331
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:10,700
Right there.

332
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,899
Yeah.

333
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,037
<i>Where's Nancy?</i>

334
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,278
She dead, sir. She been
dead more than 15 years now.

335
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,111
<i>- Where's Julia?
- She's dead, too. She been dead.</i>

336
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,349
<i>- Where's Sarah?
- She dead, too, sir.</i>

337
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,326
<i>Who the hell's out here?</i>

338
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:39,329
Just you and me and the boy here
and Martha and the Overseer...

339
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,422
and the guards and the convicts.

340
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,166
<i>- Where's my gun?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

341
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:47,334
<i>- Get it for me.
- I don't know where it is, sir.</i>

342
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:49,100
- You got a gun?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:50,607
- Get it for me.
- Yes, sir.

344
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,575
<i>- I'm going hunting.
- Yes, sir.</i>

345
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:57,372
<i>I wouldn't go hunting today if
I was you. It's Christmas Eve.</i>

346
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,543
<i>I don't care the hell what
day it is, I'm going hunting.</i>

347
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,847
Yes, sir.

348
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,421
<i>- Where is Jackson?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

349
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:10,354
<i>I'll put the lazy son of a bitch back on
the chain gang if he ain't careful, you hear?</i>

350
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:12,858
Bastard.

351
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:28,010
Ben, get out here. Martha, come here.

352
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,650
Merry Christmas.

353
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,759
<i>- What's this?
- Christmas gift.</i>

354
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:48,360
<i>That's Confederate money.
Ain't gonna buy you nothing.</i>

355
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,428
Better hold on to it. Never can tell.

356
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,862
Who the hell are you?

357
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,339
Horace Robedaux, sir.

358
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:58,774
- How old are you?
- Thirteen, sir.

359
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:03,078
- Now, whose boy are you?
- Why, you know who he is, Mr. Soll.

360
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,612
- His daddy is dead, sir.
- Let him answer.

361
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,252
<i>- Your daddy's dead?
- Yes, sir.</i>

362
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,947
What was his name?

363
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:13,586
Paul Horace Robedaux, sir.

364
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:17,518
<i>I knew the bastard. He
wasn't worth killing.</i>

365
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,792
<i>He was my brother's lawyer.
He helped my brother cheat me.</i>

366
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,197
How did you get out here?

367
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:26,533
Mr. Albert Thornton is his uncle.
He come out here in the fall...

368
00:28:26,604 --> 00:28:30,199
to help him with the store when
the crops come in. You know that.

369
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,639
<i>- Where's Albert?
- He's in town.</i>

370
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,936
<i>- What the hell's he doing in town?
- He talked to you about it.</i>

371
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:38,073
<i>Thing's are so slow in
the store here now...</i>

372
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:41,175
and the few customers there
are, the boy can take care of.

373
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,949
<i>I don't want him here. I don't want
Paul Horace Robedaux's boy on this place.</i>

374
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,550
<i>Take him to my brother's place. He'll
take care of him. I don't want him.</i>

375
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:52,756
<i>- Your brother's in New Orleans.
- Take him back to town, god damn it.</i>

376
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,358
<i>He didn't mean that. He's just drunk.</i>

377
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,871
<i>He say anything when he's drunk.
He be over his drunk tomorrow.</i>

378
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:56,916
- Now, who the hell are you?
- Horace, sir.

379
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,425
Oh, yes.

380
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,565
<i>What was your daddy's name?</i>

381
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,502
Paul Horace. Paul Horace Robedaux.

382
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,567
<i>- I knew him. He's dead.
- Yes, sir.</i>

383
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,213
- I have a brother. You ever meet him?
- No, sir.

384
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:21,144
<i>He has a place next to mine,
only we don't get along here.</i>

385
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,151
Mean, no-good bastard.

386
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:27,923
You know what my daddy said
to me just before he died?

387
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,118
No, sir.

388
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,027
<i>He called me and said,
"Everybody else out of the room.</i>

389
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:33,893
<i>"Soll," he said, "sit down.</i>

390
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:36,832
<i>"Now watch out for that
son of a bitch Tyre.</i>

391
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,028
<i>"He'll steal you blind.
He's a rattlesnake.</i>

392
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:42,236
<i>"He has venom in his fangs."</i>

393
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,132
<i>That's what his own
daddy thought about him.</i>

394
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:52,039
- You want some whiskey?
- No, sir.

395
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:58,084
I was just about to come up to
the house looking for you, sir.

396
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,284
<i>You said if I come up there
in a bit, you'd pay me.</i>

397
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,955
Pay you for what?

398
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,226
For working for you, sir.

399
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:10,362
You work for me?

400
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,729
Yes, sir. Here in your store.

401
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,564
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

402
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:18,301
Then you should pay me for
letting you work out here.

403
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:22,073
You should pay me for letting
you learn how to run a store.

404
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,574
Yes, sir. I suppose so.

405
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,875
But you agreed.

406
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,409
I agreed to nothing.

407
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:33,048
<i>Yes, sir. You did. You said
you'd pay me 50 cents a week.</i>

408
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:36,616
<i>And I've been here six months
and you ain't paid me nothing yet.</i>

409
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,992
You owe me $12.50.

410
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,363
<i>You said you'd pay me that on
Christmas Eve. And that's today.</i>

411
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,369
<i>- Before that you said you'd pay me...
- Hold on.</i>

412
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,972
<i>I must've been drunk.</i>

413
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,573
I remember you now, boy.

414
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:57,012
<i>You came out here to earn the money
for your daddy's tombstone, right?</i>

415
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,309
Yes, sir.

416
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:00,279
Your daddy was no good, Albert says.

417
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:02,546
Mistreated your
mother. Died a drunkard.

418
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,147
<i>"Why does he want to put a tombstone
on the bastard's grave?" I asked him.</i>

419
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,488
<i>"That's how the boy is,"
he says. "He's strange."</i>

420
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,459
<i>"He'll get over that," I says.</i>

421
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,224
<i>"Some woman will help
him get over that."</i>

422
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:15,489
You ever had a woman?

423
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,362
No, sir.

424
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:20,427
<i>We're gonna have to do
something about that.</i>

425
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:22,837
- Chewing tobacco?
- Yes, sir.

426
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,701
Come on. Give me a chew. Right here.

427
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:45,857
My daddy, God rest his soul in
peace, turned out to be a prophet.

428
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:49,923
<i>But my brother Tyre is a liar,
a thief, and he's a killer.</i>

429
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,532
I hope his soul rots in hell forever.

430
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,466
He got a bitch of a daughter, too.

431
00:32:56,674 --> 00:33:00,235
<i>She's up there at my house
now and I know what she wants.</i>

432
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,277
To know how I made out my will.

433
00:33:04,048 --> 00:33:08,451
<i>Every now and then she says, "Who you
gonna leave all this to, Uncle Soll?"</i>

434
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,220
- Can you write?
- Yes, sir.

435
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,126
Get a pencil and a piece of
paper. Take down what I tell you.

436
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:22,758
Everything.

437
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,703
All my land. Everything.

438
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:33,205
- Ready?
- Yeah.

439
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,837
<i>"I, Soll Gauthier...</i>

440
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,576
<i>"on my oath...</i>

441
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,747
<i>"I leave my land, my houses..."</i>

442
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,592
Who am I gonna leave it to?

443
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,653
<i>Everybody who's kin to me is dead
except Tyre and two ugly old daughters.</i>

444
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:58,565
You have a brother?

445
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:02,201
No, sir. I have a sister.

446
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:06,102
Get down on your knees, and
thank God you got no brother.

447
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,837
<i>'Cause they steal everything you got.</i>

448
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:11,075
They cut your heart out
and smile all the while.

449
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,683
Thank you, God. We thank you, God.

450
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,514
- Thank you, God.
- Yeah.

451
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,315
<i>You're a good boy.</i>

452
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,756
Come on.

453
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,593
<i>I'm going hunting. Come on with me.</i>

454
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,226
<i>Give me the gun. There's
a damn bear over there.</i>

455
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:34,965
<i>- No, sir. There's no bear...
- Yeah, there is, too.</i>

456
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,371
<i>And I'm gonna kill
the son of a bitch.</i>

457
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:40,401
<i>- I kill it?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

458
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,073
Go see. Go on.

459
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:46,343
See.

460
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:52,848
I get it?

461
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,786
Is Sarah Duncan still on the place?

462
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,495
- Sarah who?
- Sarah Duncan.

463
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,928
Is she the one you
asked Ben about earlier?

464
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,365
Ben who?

465
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,498
Ben Johnson. Lives up at the store.

466
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,799
<i>I don't know if I
asked him that or not.</i>

467
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,869
<i>She's a small woman.
No more than five feet.</i>

468
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:21,145
<i>Where's her house? It was
out this way someplace.</i>

469
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,887
<i>- Well, it's not out here now.
- It's not.</i>

470
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,253
<i>If she's the one you asked
Ben about, she's dead.</i>

471
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:31,158
- She is?
- Yup.

472
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,524
Nobody out here now
but you, me, and Ben...

473
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:40,464
and Martha, the convicts
and the guards...

474
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,364
and the Overseer and Jackson.

475
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,700
Who the hell is Jackson?

476
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:49,212
<i>Well, he's the one who stays
up at the house with you.</i>

477
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:56,275
<i>What kind of tombstone you have
in mind for your daddy's grave?</i>

478
00:35:57,688 --> 00:35:59,280
Just a small one.

479
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,548
What the hell you
want a small one for?

480
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,491
<i>See the one I put
on my daddy's grave?</i>

481
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,894
<i>It's the biggest goddamn
tombstone ever made.</i>

482
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,396
<i>It's got angels all over it.</i>

483
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,362
Two women crying.

484
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:14,761
Come here.

485
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,704
<i>Look. See, there's eight
tombstones on that graveyard.</i>

486
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,338
- Now which do you like best?
- There are no tombstones over there.

487
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,505
<i>You don't see any tombstones?</i>

488
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,113
No, sir. There are none there.

489
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,784
Who the hell took them away?
Who the hell stole them?

490
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,953
Damn convicts. They steal everything.

491
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,391
<i>Even the tombstone
off my daddy's grave.</i>

492
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:39,496
<i>No, sir. That's the convicts'
grave. That's not your graveyard.</i>

493
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,624
<i>- Where the hell's my graveyard?
- That's over yonder.</i>

494
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,697
<i>Yeah? Then let's go
find the goddamn place.</i>

495
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,976
What are you shooting at now, sir?

496
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,988
<i>Convicts. I'm gonna kill
all of them convicts.</i>

497
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,787
<i>I'm gonna have a sure enough
convict graveyard out here.</i>

498
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:18,659
Shoot you a convict?

499
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:25,166
Go on.

500
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,674
Steady.

501
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:36,247
<i>- How many we kill?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

502
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,847
- A lot?
- Yeah, I guess so, sir.

503
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:45,093
Uncle Soll?

504
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:05,078
<i>What y'all shooting at?</i>

505
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:10,616
First he said he was shooting
at bears, and then convicts.

506
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,179
<i>There ain't any bears or convicts.</i>

507
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:17,255
<i>Tried to keep him from laying on the
cold damp ground, but he wouldn't listen.</i>

508
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,590
Mr. Soll.

509
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:22,623
<i>Get up now. You'll catch
your death, Mr. Soll.</i>

510
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,835
Damn convicts take all them
tombstones off the graves.

511
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,236
<i>Now they're coming to kill me.</i>

512
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,338
Stay with him while I go get Jackson.

513
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:44,650
<i>- Get up, Sherman.
- He ain't fooling.</i>

514
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,020
<i>He's sick. He ought to
go back to the bunkhouse.</i>

515
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,128
Him go back when we
go back. Pick him up.

516
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:20,220
<i>Who's buried here? Who
the hell am I sitting on?</i>

517
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:25,322
<i>I think that's the convict that
the Sheriff shot this morning, sir.</i>

518
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,499
<i>I know who I'm sitting on.</i>

519
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,601
- Sir?
- I know.

520
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,706
I think his name is Leroy, sir.

521
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,801
<i>I know who it is. It's
a woman named Verna.</i>

522
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,576
I know who it is.

523
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,391
You crazy son of a bitch.
Where are you hiding?

524
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:15,034
Uncle Soll!

525
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,048
- Where you taking me?
- Up to the house.

526
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,242
<i>I'm going hunting.</i>

527
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,286
<i>How'll you hunt as drunk as you
are? You're getting put to bed.</i>

528
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:25,948
<i>No, I'll be goddamned
if I'm gonna be.</i>

529
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,685
<i>Come near me, I'll kill
you. Get out of here!</i>

530
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,321
Stay away from me.

531
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,193
Go on.

532
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:45,836
<i>I want the white boy to stay. He's
the only one around here I trust.</i>

533
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,674
<i>Don't cross him when he's
drunk. Go ahead. Stay with him.</i>

534
00:40:48,746 --> 00:40:51,647
<i>- I'm scared of him.
- He ain't gonna hurt you. Just go ahead.</i>

535
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:55,310
<i>He's too drunk to pull the trigger
on that damn gun. Now go ahead.</i>

536
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,421
<i>- What's your name again?
- Horace, sir.</i>

537
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,465
What are you crying for?

538
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:11,462
<i>- I'm scared, sir.
- What are you scared of?</i>

539
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:13,761
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

540
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:16,964
You scared the convicts
will get loose one night?

541
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,506
Help me up.

542
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,407
Come over there and kill you?

543
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,840
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

544
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,475
What are you scared of then?

545
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,111
A lot of things, sir.

546
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,454
<i>Come here. You're a good boy.</i>

547
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,731
Merry Christmas!

548
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:57,975
<i>Tyre's wife is a jackass. "I want
my girls to be educated," she said.</i>

549
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,211
<i>"Everybody should be educated, no
matter what color their skin is."</i>

550
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:04,550
<i>"What for?" I said. "I ain't
educated. Your husband ain't.</i>

551
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,790
<i>"We knew enough to come here...</i>

552
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:11,590
<i>"get a hold of 8,000 acres of the
richest land in the whole goddamn world.</i>

553
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:16,522
<i>"We can grow three
crops a year here."</i>

554
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:26,773
Albert says you came
out here to work.

555
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,512
<i>So you could buy a tombstone
for your daddy's grave.</i>

556
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:31,878
Yes, sir.

557
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:35,215
<i>Well, I'm gonna buy it for you.</i>

558
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:39,053
<i>I'm gonna buy the biggest
goddamn tombstone in Texas.</i>

559
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:42,989
<i>I'll put angels on it. And
two Confederate veterans.</i>

560
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:46,421
Was your daddy a Confederate veteran?

561
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,488
No, he was born after the war.

562
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,758
<i>I was a veteran. I fought in
every goddamn battle they'd let me.</i>

563
00:42:56,173 --> 00:42:58,334
What were we talking about?

564
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,201
<i>- A tombstone for my daddy's grave.
- Yeah.</i>

565
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:07,816
<i>I'll put "Rest In Peace" on it
and three verses from the Bible.</i>

566
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:13,123
Have you seen the tombstones
I had put up out here?

567
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:14,949
No, sir.

568
00:43:15,025 --> 00:43:18,119
<i>Tomorrow first thing, I'll take
you over to my family graveyard.</i>

569
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:21,596
<i>You pick out the tombstone you
like and I'll have it copied...</i>

570
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,294
<i>put it on your daddy's grave.</i>

571
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:29,595
<i>Over yonder, that's all my
land out there, see. All mine.</i>

572
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,372
Hold this.

573
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,707
<i>- You know my brother Tyre?
- I've seen him.</i>

574
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,612
Accused me of cheating him.

575
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:40,081
<i>"Why would I cheat you," I said. "I
got all the land and money I want."</i>

576
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:44,177
<i>"Give me half and you take half," he said.
"My wife is against working convicts."</i>

577
00:43:44,254 --> 00:43:46,313
<i>Then I said, "You'll
never get the work done."</i>

578
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,483
Took him two years to find out.

579
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,756
Next thing I heard, he
had his own convicts.

580
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:57,824
<i>Who's that over there
crossing the back field?</i>

581
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,330
Nobody.

582
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:06,072
Merry Christmas.

583
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,269
Uncle!

584
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,577
Uncle, you want any supper?

585
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,473
<i>- No.
- It's Christmas Eve.</i>

586
00:44:14,551 --> 00:44:18,715
<i>I don't give a goddamn what day it
is. If I wanted supper, I'd tell you.</i>

587
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:21,349
<i>- Where you going?
- I'm going hunting.</i>

588
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,454
What are you going hunting
for this time of day?

589
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,498
<i>Convicts. There's three
of them that have escaped.</i>

590
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,498
<i>- There's no damn convicts loose.
- And you're a goddamn liar.</i>

591
00:44:34,304 --> 00:44:35,828
<i>And you're crazy.</i>

592
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:38,875
You drunk so much whiskey,
it finally made you crazy.

593
00:44:38,976 --> 00:44:40,500
<i>And you're a whore.</i>

594
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:44,638
<i>My brother said, "You son of a bitch,
you're childless. I have two daughters."</i>

595
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:48,082
<i>"Two whores," I said. "Two
no-good, sluttish whores!"</i>

596
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,454
You! Leave him alone.

597
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:58,621
I hope he broke his goddamn
neck. Did you hear me?

598
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,663
I hope you broke your goddamn neck.

599
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,033
<i>You'll get nothing of mine.</i>

600
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,072
Ben and Martha are to have it
all. Are there witnesses here?

601
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,630
Who wants any of your goddamn land?

602
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,037
I have all the goddamn land I want.

603
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:19,478
Ben and Martha.
Faithful and trustworthy.

604
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,174
The convicts are all around.

605
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:24,311
Hand me my gun, please.
Allow me to defend myself.

606
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,880
<i>Don't leave me here alone,
defenseless, to have my throat cut.</i>

607
00:45:27,991 --> 00:45:30,585
I sleep with my gun beside me.

608
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:33,289
<i>Now, where's that boy?
Where's that white boy?</i>

609
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:35,688
<i>Come here. Don't leave me.</i>

610
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,763
<i>Tomorrow first thing, we'll
go to my family graveyard...</i>

611
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,241
<i>and pick out the tombstone
you like. I'll have it copied.</i>

612
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,301
<i>Put on your daddy's grave.</i>

613
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,043
<i>What's your name, boy?</i>

614
00:45:52,616 --> 00:45:54,413
- Horace, sir.
- Oh, yeah.

615
00:45:55,552 --> 00:46:00,421
<i>You're going to sleep in my room tonight.
I'll have my gun and you'll have yours.</i>

616
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:05,028
No damn convicts will
get near us, right?

617
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,064
Mr. Soll wants you up at the house.

618
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,328
<i>- Is he gonna give him his money?
- Jackson didn't say.</i>

619
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:20,740
<i>He just said that he wouldn't give him
any peace until he got him up there.</i>

620
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,836
Better go on, Horace.

621
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,081
- Well, let him finish his supper first.
- Come on now.

622
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:48,363
What happened? Did he die on you?

623
00:46:48,438 --> 00:46:50,463
Horace, over here!

624
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,134
Coming, Jackson.

625
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,748
Come on.

626
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,951
<i>He's asleep now.</i>

627
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,992
Every time he wakes up, he
ask for you to come over.

628
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:17,431
<i>He's driving me crazy asking
for you to come over here.</i>

629
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:23,502
He says he wants a white
person with him when he dies.

630
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,468
Where are Miss Asa and Mr. Billy?

631
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:31,406
<i>They went over to her daddy's place.</i>

632
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,548
Is he dying?

633
00:47:34,218 --> 00:47:36,413
<i>That's what he says.
But I don't believe him.</i>

634
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,215
<i>I've heard it all before.</i>

635
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:44,952
<i>Don't leave, Jackson. I don't
wanna be here alone when he dies.</i>

636
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,563
<i>He's not gonna die.
He just talks about it.</i>

637
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,492
Too mean to die.

638
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,037
<i>- I don't want to die, do you?
- No.</i>

639
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:02,943
I was thinking coming up here...

640
00:48:03,947 --> 00:48:07,110
of that convict, Leroy,
dying this morning.

641
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,917
He said it meant nothing to him.

642
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:16,922
I was thinking, when I die, maybe
I can go to Heaven and see my daddy.

643
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:23,356
<i>But as much as I would like to see him,
I wouldn't want to have to die to do it.</i>

644
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,213
<i>Here's another one for you, Ben.</i>

645
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,951
<i>Billy, wake up. We're at papa's.</i>

646
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:50,820
Lena!

647
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,489
There. Cobb!

648
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:57,796
<i>Ya'll come on and help me
get Billy into the house.</i>

649
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,630
<i>He's passed out again, Cobb.</i>

650
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,740
You got him there?

651
00:49:14,217 --> 00:49:15,411
Jackson?

652
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:22,789
<i>That white boy's here.</i>

653
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,621
Tell him to come in
where I can see him.

654
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,971
Did they tell you I was dying?

655
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,208
Yes, sir.

656
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,613
Has anyone sent for a
doctor to come see me?

657
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:49,880
<i>Miss Asa said she's gonna send a
doctor when she got back to town.</i>

658
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:53,150
<i>She's a damn liar. She
won't send nobody out here.</i>

659
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:56,384
She wants to see me dead so she
can claim all this for herself...

660
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,325
and her no-good father.

661
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,858
There were three of us
Gauthier boys, you know.

662
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,166
There was Tyre, Melvin and me.

663
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,702
Tyre poisoned Melvin, you know.
At least, he had him poisoned.

664
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,973
Paid a man to mix some jimsonweed
in his food and he poisoned him.

665
00:50:17,114 --> 00:50:21,107
He denied it of course, up
and down. But I know he did it.

666
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,709
<i>'Cause I have it carved
right on Melvin's tombstone.</i>

667
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,119
<i>"Poisoned by his brother Tyre...</i>

668
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:28,591
<i>"whose motive was greed."</i>

669
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,960
Come closer, boy. Come
over here. Sit here.

670
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:40,601
<i>I'm dying. Did they tell you that?</i>

671
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,669
Yes, sir.

672
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:45,900
You ever watch an old man die?

673
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:48,672
No, sir.

674
00:50:50,047 --> 00:50:54,040
<i>Promise you won't leave me alone after
I die till they get me in my coffin.</i>

675
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:56,551
<i>'Cause there are wild
varmints out here.</i>

676
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:58,980
I knew a man that died out here.

677
00:51:00,357 --> 00:51:02,222
They went off and
left his body alone...

678
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:04,954
while they went for the coffin
or the preacher or something.

679
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,620
Then they came back to the body...

680
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:09,130
and the varmints had come
and tore it all apart.

681
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,894
What kind of varmints?

682
00:51:10,967 --> 00:51:14,767
<i>I don't know. Wildcats.
Wolves. God knows what all.</i>

683
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,798
<i>Don't let that happen to me.</i>

684
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,469
No, sir.

685
00:51:20,544 --> 00:51:24,173
<i>If I fall asleep, don't leave
me, you hear? Don't leave me.</i>

686
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:26,911
No, sir.

687
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,824
- Jackson.
- Yes, sir.

688
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:42,230
- Convicts all quiet?
- Yes, sir. Been quiet.

689
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:50,066
Before daybreak, go down there and tell
the Overseer I want them convicts...

690
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,973
<i>to make a coffin for
me, if I'm dead or not.</i>

691
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:55,306
Yes, sir.

692
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,840
When you reach my time of life,
you better have your coffin handy.

693
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:03,986
<i>And when it's made, I want
you to put it under my bed.</i>

694
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:07,488
<i>And if you can't get it under
my bed, I want it beside it.</i>

695
00:52:07,891 --> 00:52:08,983
Yes, sir.

696
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:11,619
<i>Jackson, you were a
convict, weren't you?</i>

697
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:14,090
Yes, sir. You know that.

698
00:52:14,164 --> 00:52:17,497
<i>- What'd they send you to the pen for?
- Killed a man.</i>

699
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:21,629
<i>- Wasn't a white man, I hope.
- No, sir.</i>

700
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:27,407
- Was it a nigger, a colored man?
- Yes, sir.

701
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:30,843
<i>What'd you kill him for?</i>

702
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,381
<i>'Cause he killed my only brother.</i>

703
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:36,845
Took a club and clubbed him to death.

704
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,886
Then took his body into
the house and burned it up.

705
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,083
- The house, too?
- Yes, sir.

706
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:46,221
<i>Whose house was it? His
house or your brother's house?</i>

707
00:52:46,363 --> 00:52:48,092
<i>My brother's house.</i>

708
00:52:50,734 --> 00:52:53,202
- How long they give you for?
- Life.

709
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:56,937
- Well, how old were you at the time?
- Nineteen.

710
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,838
- Well, how old are
you now? - Fifty-five.

711
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,675
You know how old I am?

712
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,075
No, sir.

713
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,990
How old were you when you
came to work on this place?

714
00:53:14,324 --> 00:53:15,621
Thirty-two.

715
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,092
How long have you been a trustee?

716
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:22,890
Eight years. Ever since you killed
that convict in the closet over there.

717
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:27,470
You said you wanted someone you could
trust to guard you while you slept.

718
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,532
And can I trust you?

719
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,506
Yes, sir. I hope so. I believe so.

720
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:36,308
<i>I believe so, too.
I'll tell you what.</i>

721
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:42,073
<i>- I'm gonna leave everything I got to you.
- Thank you.</i>

722
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,347
<i>I don't want you to wait till dawn.</i>

723
00:53:45,422 --> 00:53:49,324
I want you to go out there now and get
the convicts to make my coffin for me.

724
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,089
Now, wait, Jackson. Is that
your first name or your last?

725
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,292
<i>- My first name.
- What's your last name?</i>

726
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:58,059
Hall.

727
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,395
Here.

728
00:54:05,108 --> 00:54:07,235
- This is my will.
- Thank you.

729
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,741
<i>Why'd that man kill your brother?</i>

730
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:15,477
<i>- I don't know.
- Well, how'd you kill him?</i>

731
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,848
Shot him.

732
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:22,890
What, from an ambush or did you just
walk right up to him and kill him?

733
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,922
- I walked right up to him.
- Did you give him any warning?

734
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,024
I hollered for him to
run. I was gonna kill him.

735
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,465
Did he run?

736
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:37,071
No, sir. He tried to
take the gun from me.

737
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:40,470
- And you shot him then?
- Yes, sir.

738
00:54:40,543 --> 00:54:43,671
- Did he have a gun on him?
- No, sir. Just a knife.

739
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,474
- You ever regret killing him?
- No, sir.

740
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:53,285
And you would kill him again if
you had it all to do over again?

741
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:55,449
- Yes, sir.
- You were fond of your brother?

742
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:56,856
Yes, sir.

743
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,328
Were you here...

744
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:12,663
when I shot that convict
who was hiding in the closet?

745
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:17,811
<i>I was here on the place. But I
wasn't working directly for you then.</i>

746
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,776
What was the name of
the convict I shot?

747
00:55:21,851 --> 00:55:24,183
- Which one?
- The one in the closet.

748
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:26,653
Yes, sir.

749
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:28,449
What was his name?

750
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,892
<i>Tucker. I'm not sure about that.
But I remember what he looked like.</i>

751
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:35,897
<i>He was crippled 'cause he
had run away once before.</i>

752
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:39,594
Got caught in a bear trap and broke
his leg. It never healed right.

753
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,331
So he limp walked
around here from then on.

754
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,974
Well, I walked.

755
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,313
What do you think he was
doing in that closet there?

756
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:53,348
You think he was waiting
in there to kill me?

757
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:58,348
<i>- I don't know, sir.
- What's your opinion?</i>

758
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,052
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, what?

759
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:07,054
I think he was waiting
in there to kill you.

760
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,529
I think he was, too. I think he was.

761
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:15,934
Yes, sir.

762
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,241
You hear something in
that closet over there?

763
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:22,139
- No, sir.
- Well, I do.

764
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:35,350
Come out of there, you dirty
son of a bitch, you hear me?

765
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:38,519
<i>I'll give you one more
chance. Come on out of there.</i>

766
00:56:38,695 --> 00:56:40,162
I warned you.

767
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:52,941
Go see if I killed anything in there.

768
00:57:02,986 --> 00:57:04,681
<i>I don't see nothing, sir.</i>

769
00:57:04,854 --> 00:57:07,584
How can you tell?
Go in there and look.

770
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,822
<i>- There's nothing here, sir.
- Look again.</i>

771
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:17,665
God help me.

772
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,803
Thank you, Lena.

773
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,756
Where are you from?

774
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,724
<i>I'm from Harrison.</i>

775
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:54,196
What are you doing out here?

776
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:57,863
Working for you, sir, at the store.

777
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,366
<i>You're white, aren't you?</i>

778
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:04,243
Yes, sir.

779
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:12,916
<i>Who's that old man?</i>

780
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,551
<i>That's you, sir.</i>

781
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:26,761
<i>We're the only two white people
between here and Harrison.</i>

782
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:31,965
The only other ones are the
Overseer and the two guards.

783
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:34,173
The rest are convicts.

784
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:37,769
<i>No, Ben and Martha aren't convicts.</i>

785
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,743
- Where are they?
- Down at the store.

786
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:48,047
Are you the one I
promised a tombstone?

787
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:51,424
<i>- Yes, sir.
- I haven't forgotten.</i>

788
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,358
And I owe you money.

789
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:56,028
Yes, sir.

790
00:58:56,432 --> 00:59:00,061
<i>Soon as Jackson gets back I'm
gonna pay you what I owe you.</i>

791
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:01,827
How much is it?

792
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,406
$12.50.

793
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,805
- $12.50?
- Yes, sir.

794
00:59:06,943 --> 00:59:10,208
<i>I'm gonna pay you $100,
maybe even $1,000...</i>

795
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,680
for all your kindness to an old man.

796
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,115
<i>You know how much my
daddy's tombstone cost?</i>

797
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:18,984
$5,000. I brought it by
boat from New Orleans.

798
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,498
Used to be a woman
out here named Sarah.

799
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,068
You seen her lately?

800
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,602
<i>No, sir. I believe she's dead.</i>

801
00:59:41,778 --> 00:59:43,609
How do you know that?

802
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:46,110
I heard Ben say it.

803
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,977
- Ben who?
- Ben Johnson.

804
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,044
He was born on this place.

805
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,315
- Talk up.
- No, sir! Jackson!

806
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,263
<i>- Wasn't anything in the closet.
- No?</i>

807
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,822
I swore I heard something in there.

808
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:05,931
Yes, sir.

809
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,138
Go get them to make
my coffin right now.

810
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:11,871
Go on.

811
01:00:13,676 --> 01:00:14,938
Yes, sir.

812
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:53,582
I had a dream one night last week.

813
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:58,253
I had a dream that the convicts
got loose and they came over here...

814
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,789
and they caught me
here in this very chair.

815
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,855
And they shot Jackson,
and they bound me.

816
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,191
<i>I don't remember if
they shot Jackson or not.</i>

817
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:12,792
Part of the time it seemed
like Jackson was one of them.

818
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:19,199
Did you hear anything in
that closet over there?

819
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,906
No, sir.

820
01:01:23,613 --> 01:01:25,046
Well, I did.

821
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,945
Come out of there, you
son of a bitch! I hear you!

822
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:36,688
<i>I'll give you one more
chance to come out of there.</i>

823
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,717
I warned you.

824
01:01:47,603 --> 01:01:49,434
That got whoever was in there.

825
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:51,903
Go see who it was. Go on.

826
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:54,301
No, sir.

827
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,642
Are you scared?

828
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,841
<i>Well, I'll go. Help me up.</i>

829
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:14,655
<i>I knew there was somebody in
here. I'll kill the son of a bitch.</i>

830
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,631
<i>There's blood every place.</i>

831
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,397
Cripple.

832
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:21,194
<i>He's a cripple.</i>

833
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:29,604
What were we talking about?

834
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,704
Oh, yeah, about my dream.

835
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:37,617
I was sitting here and Jackson
came in with all them convicts.

836
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,278
I never saw so many.

837
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:42,789
And they grabbed me and Jackson
had a club and he began to club me.

838
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,688
<i>I said, "Jackson, you're killing me."</i>

839
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,623
Then all the convicts grabbed
clubs and began to beat me.

840
01:02:47,897 --> 01:02:51,958
<i>And Jackson set fire to the house.
I said, "Why did you do that?"</i>

841
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,763
I swear, I said it.

842
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,704
<i>He said, "We're gonna burn you
and all you got to the ground."</i>

843
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,049
Get out of my damn chair. Get up. Go.

844
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,150
Buttermilk.

845
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,456
<i>Here, that'll put hair on your chest.</i>

846
01:03:44,687 --> 01:03:47,815
- Where you been?
- I went to tell them about your coffin.

847
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:50,419
- Have they started?
- Yes, sir.

848
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,122
They making it out of cypress wood?

849
01:03:55,464 --> 01:03:56,954
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

850
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,093
<i>- When it's finished will they bring it here?
- Yes, sir.</i>

851
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,995
How long will that be?

852
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,772
<i>They'll have it done in an hour.</i>

853
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:09,607
<i>I killed a man in the closet. It's
full of blood, so you go clean it up.</i>

854
01:04:10,146 --> 01:04:12,774
- Get Ben to help you bury the body.
- Yes, sir.

855
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,908
That was a convict.

856
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:19,287
<i>So you bury him in the
convict's graveyard, you hear?</i>

857
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,652
Yes, sir.

858
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,489
<i>- He's a cripple.
- Yes, sir.</i>

859
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:30,794
How many convicts we have out here?

860
01:04:32,501 --> 01:04:34,230
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

861
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:38,869
<i>If I live, tomorrow I'm gonna
go out there and count them.</i>

862
01:04:40,509 --> 01:04:41,874
If I live.

863
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:45,908
- Nobody in that closet, sir.
- No?

864
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:47,409
No, sir.

865
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,746
- You see any blood?
- No, sir.

866
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,317
I saw a crippled convict lying there.

867
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:58,222
<i>Blood over the walls and on
the floor. So, don't tell me.</i>

868
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,078
This is my mama.

869
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,558
<i>There's nothing in there.</i>

870
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:34,128
<i>- Who's that singing in there?
- I am.</i>

871
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:37,995
Jackson, come here.

872
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:42,931
Sit down there.

873
01:06:01,891 --> 01:06:04,485
<i>What was my mama's name?
Any you all remember?</i>

874
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:05,925
No, sir.

875
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:07,628
No, sir.

876
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:13,695
I think it was Erna.
She died when I was born.

877
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,236
My daddy raised me
and my two brothers.

878
01:06:18,374 --> 01:06:22,504
<i>It was my daddy's
idea to get convicts.</i>

879
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:26,476
We tried after slavery
to have tenants out here.

880
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:31,453
We had 300 at one time
living on the place.

881
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:36,056
But we had a series of bad crop years
and we all nearly starved. So papa said...

882
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,720
<i>"Get rid of the tenants
and hire yourself convicts."</i>

883
01:06:41,964 --> 01:06:43,295
And I did.

884
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:11,058
Now where is my mama buried?
Is she buried out here?

885
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:12,885
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

886
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:18,262
<i>I don't think she is.</i>

887
01:07:19,835 --> 01:07:22,633
I think one of them
convicts got loose...

888
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:30,236
and took a club, clubbed her to death
and burned her body up in the house.

889
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:32,906
The house we used to live
in burned to the ground.

890
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,542
<i>That's why we never had
a picture of my mama.</i>

891
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:39,216
<i>'Cause all her letters and
pictures were burned in the fire.</i>

892
01:07:39,889 --> 01:07:41,447
Except this one.

893
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:56,271
<i>Could somebody please tell
me where my mama's buried?</i>

894
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,105
<i>I don't know.</i>

895
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:00,841
<i>What's the boy's name?</i>

896
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,944
Horace, sir.

897
01:08:04,113 --> 01:08:06,707
Horace, come here to me. Come here.

898
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,140
Sit down here.

899
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:18,589
When I was your age...

900
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,257
this was all dense forest.

901
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,900
<i>So thick a man or boy couldn't
get through without a cane knife...</i>

902
01:08:24,967 --> 01:08:27,299
to cut his way through, you see.

903
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:32,039
<i>Besides the forest, there's something
out here I've seen no other place.</i>

904
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,633
Miles of cane.

905
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,610
Cane that grew 10 and 12 feet high.

906
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:41,940
<i>And so thick, you couldn't make
your way through without a knife.</i>

907
01:08:42,818 --> 01:08:44,615
And a cold spell would come...

908
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:48,623
kill the cane and it would lie rotting
on the ground until the spring...

909
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:50,988
and then a new crop would start up.

910
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,591
<i>That's why they call this Cane Land.</i>

911
01:08:54,063 --> 01:08:56,759
- Did you know that?
- No, sir.

912
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,362
- Did you know that, Jackson?
- Yes, sir.

913
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:05,505
- Do you know any songs, Jackson?
- Yes, sir. I know some.

914
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,472
<i>Do you know Golden Slippers?</i>

915
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:13,140
<i>- That's what I been humming.
- Get up here and sing it.</i>

916
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:32,391
<i>Golden slippers, golden slippers</i>

917
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:35,369
<i>Oh, them golden slippers</i>

918
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,565
<i>Oh, golden slippers Golden slippers</i>

919
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:41,908
<i>I don't remember the rest
of it. I know some hymns.</i>

920
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,911
<i>Don't sing them around
me. I can't bear.</i>

921
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,507
Yes, sir.

922
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:50,279
<i>And another thing. If I die, I
don't want any preacher near me.</i>

923
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:53,549
<i>Yes, sir. But who gonna pray over
you if you don't have a preacher?</i>

924
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:55,817
<i>I don't want anybody praying over me.</i>

925
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:58,655
<i>And I don't want my brother
here or any of his children.</i>

926
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,126
Who you want then?

927
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:02,924
Just you and Ben and Martha.

928
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,301
And this boy here. And Sarah.

929
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,996
<i>- Sarah can't be there.
- Why?</i>

930
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:12,396
<i>She's dead.</i>

931
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,945
<i>Don't you want any white
people there except Horace?</i>

932
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,206
- Is the Overseer white?
- Yeah.

933
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:21,715
- And the two guards?
- Yeah.

934
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:23,217
They can come.

935
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:26,249
<i>It'll not be much of a funeral.
You won't have a preacher...</i>

936
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:28,790
<i>you don't like hymns, what
kind of funeral will it be?</i>

937
01:10:28,857 --> 01:10:30,586
<i>It's the kind I want.</i>

938
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:34,388
Now go see how they getting
along with my coffin. Go on.

939
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,125
Yes, sir.

940
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,152
- That coffin about ready?
- Almost.

941
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,020
Did you know that boy Mr.
Albert Thornton brought out here?

942
01:11:37,092 --> 01:11:38,389
Yes, sir.

943
01:11:38,894 --> 01:11:40,589
- It was me.
- Was it?

944
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,764
<i>- Yes, sir.
- You're the one whose daddy died?</i>

945
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:50,471
<i>My daddy's dead, too. Stroke.</i>

946
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:54,703
He got so mad at them
convicts he had a stroke.

947
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,801
Fell over dead.

948
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,439
You think them bastards would
call out and tell us? No.

949
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,649
They went on working, left him lying
dead there in the cotton fields.

950
01:12:09,258 --> 01:12:11,556
My daddy was 84 when he died.

951
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:14,221
How old was your daddy?

952
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:15,929
He was just 32.

953
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:23,070
Well, we all have to go sometime.

954
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,102
Is it daylight yet?

955
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:29,876
No, sir.

956
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:32,773
What time is it?

957
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,210
<i>I don't know, sir.</i>

958
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,953
I got a watch. Look and see there.

959
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,256
<i>It says it's 11:00 p. m.</i>

960
01:12:53,802 --> 01:12:55,997
<i>I think it's later than that, though.</i>

961
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,863
Get out of the damn chair.

962
01:13:03,812 --> 01:13:06,610
You hear something in
that closet in there?

963
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,211
- No, sir.
- I did.

964
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:13,281
Come out of there,
you son of a bitch.

965
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:15,653
You hear me? Give
you one more chance.

966
01:13:27,669 --> 01:13:30,297
- You got a gun?
- No, sir.

967
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:33,904
<i>What'll protect us now?</i>

968
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:36,934
I need bullets for my gun.

969
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,878
Got your coffin.

970
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,724
Where do you want it?

971
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:53,760
Put it down here. Right here.

972
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:58,123
Jackson says that you worried
about this being mere cypress wood.

973
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:01,065
<i>Well, it's made of
cypress wood all right.</i>

974
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,331
Grab hold of the top of it, Jackson.

975
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:12,508
<i>- Let me try it out, see if it fits.
- It's bound to fit.</i>

976
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:14,845
Let me be the judge of that, Jackson.

977
01:14:15,751 --> 01:14:19,380
My Confederate coat. Hold it.

978
01:14:26,662 --> 01:14:28,289
Help me in there.

979
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,255
<i>- Don't you want your trousers, too?
- No.</i>

980
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:34,530
- Horace, you got a chew of tobacco?
- Sure.

981
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,601
I learned a long time ago.

982
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,366
Wait for your pillow.

983
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,429
Here. I got a knife.

984
01:14:39,508 --> 01:14:41,032
- So what?
- Thanks.

985
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:43,611
You know the convict
that died last night?

986
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,809
The one that said he was too sick to
work? I guess he was telling the truth.

987
01:14:47,916 --> 01:14:49,508
Was his name Sherman Edwards?

988
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:52,349
<i>That's his name. Just
finished burying him.</i>

989
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,790
Mr. Soll gone to
sleep in that coffin.

990
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,022
<i>Maybe he's dead.</i>

991
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,692
No, he just asleep.

992
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,097
He had a lot to drink, you know.

993
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,897
<i>Well, I'm gonna go.</i>

994
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:10,896
<i>I'm wore out.</i>

995
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:17,737
- Did you know Sherman Edwards?
- Sure. I know them all.

996
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,641
<i>Ain't you sleepy?</i>

997
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,441
Yes, I am.

998
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,320
Mr. Soll, can the boy
go on to sleep now?

999
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,002
You better come on back up here.
Mr. Soll is dead in his coffin.

1000
01:15:51,513 --> 01:15:55,074
He was all alone in
his coffin when he died.

1001
01:15:55,851 --> 01:15:58,217
He was. He better get used
to being alone in there.

1002
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,812
He gonna be alone in
there for a long time.

1003
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,748
- He dead. Old devil is dead.
- Is he?

1004
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,695
He sure is. He gone.

1005
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:11,432
<i>I'm gonna have to go
get word to Miss Asa.</i>

1006
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,501
<i>But he say he don't
want her at the funeral.</i>

1007
01:16:13,669 --> 01:16:15,296
Nor his brother.

1008
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:19,237
<i>And he don't want a
preacher. Give me a hand here.</i>

1009
01:16:19,308 --> 01:16:21,401
You gonna be the
one to tell her that?

1010
01:16:21,476 --> 01:16:23,535
<i>Not me. I'm scared of her.</i>

1011
01:16:32,554 --> 01:16:35,990
- I wonder what will happen to me.
- What do you mean?

1012
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:41,257
I was paroled to him. They can
send me back to the pen now.

1013
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:45,261
<i>- Why don't you take off?
- Where am I gonna go?</i>

1014
01:16:45,334 --> 01:16:47,029
<i>I'm too old to run.</i>

1015
01:16:51,907 --> 01:16:53,807
He was right and I was wrong.

1016
01:16:53,875 --> 01:16:56,105
He said he was gonna die and he did.

1017
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:59,337
What time do you think
we ought to bury him?

1018
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:02,175
<i>I guess as soon as it's daylight.</i>

1019
01:17:03,585 --> 01:17:07,453
<i>Can't have much of a funeral cause he
don't want no hymns and no preacher.</i>

1020
01:17:07,522 --> 01:17:09,353
<i>I can say the Lord's Prayer.</i>

1021
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:11,756
<i>- He didn't say I couldn't do that.
- No.</i>

1022
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:16,693
And you could testify.

1023
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:20,663
<i>- He didn't say you couldn't do that.
- No.</i>

1024
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:25,361
I could say that he always
worked hard. I can say that.

1025
01:17:27,275 --> 01:17:30,733
And I could say he let me be
a trustee. I could say that.

1026
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,008
And he drank a lot of whiskey.

1027
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:37,548
- You hear something?
- That was rats, I think.

1028
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,116
This old house full of rats.

1029
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,712
I heard something...

1030
01:17:43,058 --> 01:17:44,650
in that coffin.

1031
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,724
<i>Oh, my God. He's risen from the dead.</i>

1032
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:54,299
<i>- We thought you was dead.
- I wasn't dead. I wasn't.</i>

1033
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:58,129
<i>Maybe you thought I
was. I'm not dead yet.</i>

1034
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,669
Hand me my gun.

1035
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,305
Sherman Edwards is dead.

1036
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:07,374
Who the hell is Sherman Edwards?

1037
01:18:07,449 --> 01:18:10,475
Brother of that convict
got his throat cut.

1038
01:18:11,353 --> 01:18:14,151
- Somebody kill him?
- No, sir. He just died.

1039
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:17,950
<i>He told you he was too sick to
work, but you wouldn't believe him.</i>

1040
01:18:18,026 --> 01:18:20,688
- Who buried him?
- I did. I bury them all.

1041
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:25,461
- You thought you were going to bury me.
- Yes, sir. I did.

1042
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,934
<i>You think I was dead? I wasn't dead.</i>

1043
01:18:28,170 --> 01:18:29,694
<i>I'm never gonna die.</i>

1044
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:32,201
Tell them to take that
damn coffin out of here.

1045
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:34,572
I changed my mind about
dying. Take it out.

1046
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:35,940
Yes, sir.

1047
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,443
<i>I knew he wasn't dead.</i>

1048
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,678
I might outlive all of them people.

1049
01:18:43,752 --> 01:18:45,276
Asa and my devilish brother.

1050
01:18:45,353 --> 01:18:49,619
Ben and Jackson. All the damn
convicts. I might outlive them all.

1051
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:56,990
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

1052
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:00,291
<i>Maybe I ain't gonna outlive you.</i>

1053
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,600
Let me look at you.

1054
01:19:05,307 --> 01:19:09,266
<i>I never married. I didn't have
no children I know of anyways.</i>

1055
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:14,372
- You got a daddy?
- No, sir.

1056
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,719
- What happened to him?
- He died.

1057
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:21,378
- You an orphan?
- No, sir. I have a mama.

1058
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,684
Where the hell is she?

1059
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:28,122
<i>She's in Houston.</i>

1060
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:31,489
Be my boy.

1061
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,098
A desert born.

1062
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,440
<i>One minute I think I'm gonna live.</i>

1063
01:19:48,683 --> 01:19:50,674
<i>The next minute, I'm gonna die.</i>

1064
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:53,978
Come closer to me now. Come here.

1065
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,720
I got money.

1066
01:20:04,900 --> 01:20:07,892
Hidden in the back of
that closet in a suitcase.

1067
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:11,603
Now go get it for me so I
can pay you what I owe you.

1068
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:16,140
Reward you handsomely besides
for your kindness to an old man.

1069
01:20:16,978 --> 01:20:18,275
Which one?

1070
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:21,371
The small one.

1071
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:25,443
Bring it here.

1072
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:32,090
<i>- How much money you think I have here?
- I don't know, sir.</i>

1073
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:37,256
<i>More than $10,000 last I
counted and you're to get half.</i>

1074
01:20:37,866 --> 01:20:40,562
Now reach in there
and hand me the money.

1075
01:20:46,975 --> 01:20:48,567
<i>There's no money in here, sir.</i>

1076
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,873
<i>Don't lie to me, boy.
Don't try to fool me.</i>

1077
01:20:50,946 --> 01:20:54,313
<i>- I'm not lying to you, sir.
- Hand me that goddamn suitcase.</i>

1078
01:21:08,263 --> 01:21:10,128
<i>My God, I've been robbed.</i>

1079
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:13,293
Call Ben. Call Jackson.
Call the goddamn Overseer.

1080
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,928
I want all of them
goddamn convicts searched.

1081
01:21:16,438 --> 01:21:19,703
<i>Someone's robbed me of my
money. Come here! Boy, come here!</i>

1082
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:23,406
<i>Don't leave me. Don't ever leave me.</i>

1083
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,742
<i>I don't care about the goddamn money.</i>

1084
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:28,649
<i>You don't leave me.</i>

1085
01:21:29,551 --> 01:21:32,349
<i>Anyway, the money wasn't
in the goddamn suitcase.</i>

1086
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,954
I just remembered
I buried that money.

1087
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:38,587
<i>Out there in one of
them convict's graves.</i>

1088
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:42,760
Call Ben.

1089
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:48,596
<i>Ben, do you know which convict's
grave I hid the money in?</i>

1090
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,968
<i>I'm gonna pay this
boy what I owe him.</i>

1091
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:52,570
No, sir.

1092
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,584
- Do you read?
- Yes, sir.

1093
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:07,088
Get that paper over there.

1094
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,019
Read me the news.

1095
01:22:17,265 --> 01:22:19,130
This is an old paper.

1096
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,232
<i>It's dated 1865.</i>

1097
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:25,305
<i>It says "Texas can't
come back into the Union."</i>

1098
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:26,704
Why?

1099
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:29,567
- Because it was in the Confederacy.
- Oh, yes.

1100
01:22:30,712 --> 01:22:32,202
Read it to me.

1101
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:37,374
<i>"Yesterday, Gen. Gordon Granger of
the Union Army took possession...</i>

1102
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:41,513
<i>"of Texas from Confederate
Lt. Gov. Fletcher Stockdale."</i>

1103
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,551
Come closer to me.

1104
01:22:44,392 --> 01:22:46,519
<i>Don't let them bury
me with my own family.</i>

1105
01:22:46,594 --> 01:22:50,121
Because my brother and his daughter
are going to be buried there.

1106
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:53,065
<i>And I don't want to be
buried by them or near them.</i>

1107
01:22:53,301 --> 01:22:56,964
<i>I'd rather have convicts near
me than that stinking bunch.</i>

1108
01:23:01,743 --> 01:23:05,736
<i>"The General, speaking to a subdued
crowd at Galveston's City Hall said...</i>

1109
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:08,578
<i>"'Texas can't come
back into the Union.'</i>

1110
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:13,843
<i>"Rights of the citizenship are
offered only to those individuals...</i>

1111
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:18,325
<i>"who do not own property
exceeding the value of $20,000...</i>

1112
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,227
<i>"or possessing more
than 100 bales of cotton.</i>

1113
01:23:22,297 --> 01:23:27,200
<i>"Meanwhile, 52,000 troops under
the command of Gen. Sheridan...</i>

1114
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:32,168
<i>"dispersed throughout the state and along
the border to enforce martial order...</i>

1115
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:37,434
<i>"and to restore the authority of the
United States over the territory of Texas.</i>

1116
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:40,744
<i>"Gen. Granger..."</i>

1117
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:50,621
Mr. Soll.

1118
01:24:18,286 --> 01:24:19,548
He dead.

1119
01:24:20,755 --> 01:24:22,313
He dead for sure.

1120
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,389
<i>There'll be no more hollering
and cussing from him now.</i>

1121
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:29,328
Is that all there is to
dying? Your breath just stops?

1122
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,388
Yes. When you go like that.

1123
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,100
Do you think Mr. Soll minded dying?

1124
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,464
<i>I don't know.</i>

1125
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:41,970
<i>- Do you think my daddy minded dying?
- I don't know.</i>

1126
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:45,745
<i>Ben, he won't let me go.</i>

1127
01:24:57,058 --> 01:24:58,616
He minded dying.

1128
01:24:59,794 --> 01:25:02,422
I think he minded
it in the worst way.

1129
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:04,826
I think he did, too.

1130
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:09,336
<i>And I think my daddy did.
That's what worries me.</i>

1131
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:16,100
- Go get Jackson.
- No. I think you better go.

1132
01:25:17,912 --> 01:25:22,576
I promised Mr. Soll to sit by
him with the gun after he died...

1133
01:25:24,252 --> 01:25:27,915
<i>- till we got him in his coffin.
- Don't let that bother you.</i>

1134
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:32,486
<i>Look at all the things he promised
you. He didn't keep one of them.</i>

1135
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:39,322
<i>No. But I'd like to keep
mine. It'd make me feel better.</i>

1136
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,067
How much did the devil owe you?

1137
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:47,835
$12.50.

1138
01:25:48,543 --> 01:25:52,946
<i>One time he said he'd pay me
$500, then $1,000, then $5,000...</i>

1139
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:56,842
<i>and a tombstone for my daddy's grave.</i>

1140
01:25:59,254 --> 01:26:01,245
He said a lot of things.

1141
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:04,587
He was always making promises.

1142
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:08,360
<i>And Miss Asa gonna
get it all. You'll see.</i>

1143
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:30,746
Miss Asa!

1144
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,890
They upstairs, sleeping
off their drunk.

1145
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,861
- Tell Miss Asa I need to see her.
- Why?

1146
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:52,899
Mr. Soll is dead.

1147
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:56,577
I need to know where
she want him buried at.

1148
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:10,953
<i>I hope we're doing right, burying him
out here instead of with his people.</i>

1149
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:14,121
Well, he said he want
to be buried here.

1150
01:27:15,129 --> 01:27:17,290
<i>That's all we have to go on.</i>

1151
01:27:23,638 --> 01:27:26,106
He sure has a pretty
day for his funeral.

1152
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:41,980
<i>- Anybody else coming, you think?
- No. This is all there's gonna be.</i>

1153
01:27:43,224 --> 01:27:45,886
<i>Miss Asa, she wouldn't want to come.</i>

1154
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:49,524
<i>She don't care what we do
with him. Bury him here...</i>

1155
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:51,997
<i>or throw him in the
creek. She don't care.</i>

1156
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:55,524
<i>Mr. Billy's still drunk.
Overseer don't want to come.</i>

1157
01:27:57,872 --> 01:27:59,464
<i>It's just us.</i>

1158
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:03,738
<i>And he don't want no hymns,
no prayers, and no preachers.</i>

1159
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:06,613
<i>And he won't have no tombstone.</i>

1160
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,808
<i>Unless she puts one up
and you know she won't.</i>

1161
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:12,444
Martha and I went over to his
family graveyard yesterday evening.

1162
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:17,090
<i>He said his daddy's tombstone had angels
all over it and it came from New Orleans.</i>

1163
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,150
<i>- But I couldn't find it.
- He was lying.</i>

1164
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:24,697
<i>There wasn't nothing on it. Just a slab
of marble sticking up with his name on it.</i>

1165
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:27,064
<i>If the convicts didn't
keep it weeded over there...</i>

1166
01:28:27,135 --> 01:28:29,399
<i>you wouldn't find it
for the weeds in a week.</i>

1167
01:28:29,470 --> 01:28:33,236
I told her that you were still here,
stayed all night with him till he died...

1168
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:36,334
<i>and he still owed you money.
She said that's your hard luck.</i>

1169
01:28:36,411 --> 01:28:38,311
<i>She'll pay none of his debts.</i>

1170
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:41,376
I asked her why? How
would you get back to town?

1171
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:43,439
<i>She said "walk."</i>

1172
01:28:44,919 --> 01:28:48,047
<i>We'll all be walking, I guess,
cause she's gonna close the store...</i>

1173
01:28:48,122 --> 01:28:50,556
<i>and take the convicts
over to her daddy's place.</i>

1174
01:28:50,625 --> 01:28:53,685
She said weeds, the trees and
the cane can take this land.

1175
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:57,162
<i>Six months from now you won't even
be able to tell who was buried here.</i>

1176
01:28:57,231 --> 01:29:01,167
Not my people. Not the
convicts. Not Mr. Soll.

1177
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:05,000
The weeds, the trees and
the cane take everything.

1178
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:08,975
<i>"Cane Land" it was called once.
Cane Land it will be again.</i>

1179
01:29:09,744 --> 01:29:13,111
The house will go, the store
will go, and the graves will go.

1180
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,145
Those with tombstones
and those without.

1181
01:29:15,216 --> 01:29:18,583
<i>I could sing Golden
Slippers. He liked that.</i>

1182
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:23,851
<i>He asked me to sing it once but I
couldn't remember. But now I can.</i>

1183
01:29:24,826 --> 01:29:26,726
Go ahead. Sing it then.

1184
01:29:29,063 --> 01:29:32,123
<i>Oh, my golden slippers are laid away</i>

1185
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,135
<i>I don't expect to wear
them till my wedding day</i>

1186
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:37,899
<i>and my long-tailed
coat that I love so well</i>

1187
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:40,497
<i>I'll wear it on the
chariot in the morning</i>

1188
01:29:40,575 --> 01:29:44,170
<i>And my long white robe
that I bought last June</i>

1189
01:29:44,245 --> 01:29:46,907
<i>I'm gonna get it changed
'cause it fit too soon</i>

1190
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:51,941
<i>And the old gray horse that I used to ride
I'll hitch it to the chariot in the morning</i>

1191
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:56,118
<i>Oh, dem golden slippers</i>

1192
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:59,648
<i>Oh, dem golden
slippers Golden slippers</i>

1193
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:00,989
Yes, sir.

1194
01:30:01,696 --> 01:30:05,427
The house will go, the store
will go, and the graves will go.

1195
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:09,027
Those with tombstones
and those without.

1196
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:11,230
<i>So it's goodbye children</i>

1197
01:30:11,305 --> 01:30:16,242
<i>I will have to go where the rain
don't fall Or the wind don't blow</i>

1198
01:30:16,377 --> 01:30:20,177
<i>And the Ulster coats
Why you will not need</i>

1199
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:24,144
<i>When you ride up in the
chariot In the morning</i>
