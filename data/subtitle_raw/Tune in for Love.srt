Uh, well...

30
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,313

31
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,400

How about... regular milk?

35
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,878
It has to have soybeans.

36
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:14,092
There's a grocery store up the street.

37
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,510

- Tofu?
- Uh-huh.

54
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,519
He went into that store.

00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,331
she was just 18
when she started working here.

92
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,208
She learned fast.

93
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,376
Learned how to knead bread dough
almost right away,

94
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,630
and she became as good as my mom.

95
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,048
Come on.

96
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:26,385
My mom relied on Eun-ja

99
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,688
I should get the store ready
for the evening rush.

00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,157
When I was at the juvenile center,

101
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,828
I always went to breakfast
at 9 a.m. sharp.

102
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,127
Every day, I'd hear the music
and think to myself,

103
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:04,173
"Oh, I'm still here."

104
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,719
<i>After I finish my breakfast
and return my tray,</i>

105
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,222
<i>I'd hear the reporter finish talking.</i>

106
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,683
<i>Then I knew...</i>

107
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,519
<i>it'd be about 9:50.</i>

108
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,896
Prayed every day.

109
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,899
"Just get me out of here.

110
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,402
Please."

111
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,073
After my prayer, the radio show would end.

112
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,242
<i>And I would know...</i>

113
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,286
<i>nothing...</i>

114
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,538
<i>will happen today.</i>

115

<i>Every day
was the exact same routine,</i>

116
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,297
<i>but one day, during my prayers,
I said this,</i>

117
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,675
<i>"God, let at least one thing</i>

118
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:50,261

00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,014
<i>I don't think...</i>

120
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:55,641
<i>I can go on if nothing has changed."</i>

00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,512
I'm back.

182
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,430
Hey, you.

183
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,140
Oh, you're still here?

184
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,190
Have you ever seen anything this adorable?

185
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,650
Definitely not.

186
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,528
Christmas cupcakes. Looking good!

187
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,737
They're so cute.

188
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,949
Hey, Hyeon-u.

189
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,825
The Christmas tree is in that box.

190
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,744
Could you take it out and dust it?

191
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,454
You can leave after that.

192
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,831
Eun-ja, let me just wash my hands.

193
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,333
Okay, but he wants to help.

194
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,627
Yeah?

195
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,588
- Do you?
- Uh-huh.

196
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,799
Let's try to boost our sales a bit.

197
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,261
Just set it up outside.

198
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,555
Yes, ma'am.

199
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,184
Outside?

200
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,313
You don't have to be so formal.

201
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,942
Most of my friends
are the same age as you.

202
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:24,780
Okay.

203
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:42,131
Wow.

204
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,176
My mom would always put
the Christmas tree outside,

205
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,345
so everyone could enjoy it.

206
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,519
It's pretty.

207
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,314
Oh, it's beautiful.

208
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,732
They look so good.

209
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,567
- Come in, it's cold.
- Yeah.

210
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,196
- Okay, those do look good there.
- I knew it.

211
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,990
- Let's put that there.
- This one?

212
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,033
Yeah.

213
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,118
Can we take a picture?

214
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,703
A picture?

215
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,538
Uh, yeah, of us three together.

216
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,040
With everything, even the cupcakes.

217
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,000
That's a really good idea.

218
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,085
We should get all this in the picture.

219
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,422
- Uh, we should give them names.
- Huh?

220
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,341
Like, "Fly, Little Birdie" cupcake,

221
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,301
"An Old Memory" cupcake,

222
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,719
and "A Long Time Ago" cupcake.

223
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,305
What are you talking about?

224
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,599
There are music award shows
every year.

225
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,267
We should do the same for our cupcakes.

226
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,978
I'll give the award
to whichever cupcake...

227
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,271
is the best singer.

228
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,899
Sure, why not?

229
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,318
But I'll have to taste
each one of these first.

230
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,575
Why do they have to start construction
right around Christmas?

231
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,162
This is usually our best time of year.

232
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,039
They're building apartments.

233
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,916
We'll get more customers soon.

234
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,839
Hey! That's too loud!

235
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,526
Good morning.

236
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,030
Hey, buddy. Merry Christmas.

237
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,782
Hyeon-u?

238
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,743
What are you doing here?

239
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:39,832
Why are you here?

240
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,835
I got a job around here
because I ran away from home, all right?

241
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,465
It's so freaking
cold out there.

242
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,094
I'll just hang out here for a bit.

243
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,805
Oh. This...

244
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,682
looks good.

245
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,686
Would you like a coffee with that?

246
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,271
I'm fine.

247
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,567
Probably should've waited
until the spring to run away.

248
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,693
This is brutal.

249
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,612
- Uh...
- I saved his ass.

250
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,531
I'm the one who got him out of jail.

251
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,325
And now, we run into each other
right before Christmas.

252
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,077
I didn't expect to see him here.

253
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,956
You know, if it weren't for me,

254
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,751
you'd be spending this Christmas
back in prison.

255
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,128
Quack, quack, quack!

256
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,546
- Little duckies.
- Oh.

257
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,173
- Let me hear you.
- They're here.

258
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,383
Duckies!

259
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,885
- Go on in.
- Hello.

260
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,012
- Hello.
- Hello!

261
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,096
Quack, quack, quack!

262
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,598
I'll give you one, hold on.

263
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,309
This one has chocolate buttons on the top.

264
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,019
Oh? Which one?

265
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,027
Can't believe he still rides that scooter.

266
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:52,738
- Yo! What took you so long?
- Dude, where were you?

267
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,490
Let me at least say hi to him first.

268
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,158
- What's up? I'm glad you're back.
- Yeah.

269
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,035
Yeah? Do you realize
what time it is?

270
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,496
I saw this all the way back
at the intersection down the road.

271
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,830
Did you know?

272
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,832
Yeah, I did.
That's how I found the place.

273
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,376
We all did.
You're the only one who's late, dumbass.

274
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,628
- What?
- Yeah, that's...

275
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,838
Take this and leave.

276
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,884
Hey, we're helping you
with your sales.

277
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,094
We don't need your help.

278
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,970
- Oh, yeah?
- Hey, let's talk outside.

279
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,180
- Why?
- Come on.

280
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,182
- Why do we have to talk outside?
- We're just visiting our friend.

281
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,643
- Get out, all of you.
- Forget it, let's go.

282
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,651
Would it be possible
to get paid in advance?

283
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,696
Hey, let's go already!
What are you doing in there?

284
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,698
Come on!

285
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,831
Hey, what are you doing?
Let's go! Get us out of here!

286
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:45,040
Let's go!

287
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,043
Hurry up!

288
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,296
They're not all bad.

289
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,553
We've gotta go!

290
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,304
Fuck, let's get out of here!

291
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:05,978
Let's go.

292
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,032
You think he's leaving for good?

293
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,077
Mm-hm.

294
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,620
Probably.

295
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,624
You think he'll ever come back?

296
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,252
Hm.

297
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,754
He's too good-looking.

298
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,053
Zero!

299
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,306
- Seven.
- Bang!

300
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,767
Yo, what's that?

301
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,520
- Okay, I gotta take a piss.
- I gotta take it, my hands are shaking.

302
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,689
- I really need to piss.
- Yeah? No way.

303
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,816
- Tell this guy to drink!
- No, no, no.

304
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,401
- I can't, I can't.
- Guys, guys...

305
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,445
I would slur my words.

306
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,654
Have some kimchi.

307
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,239
- Don't let me off easy.
- Hey!

308
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,824
I'm glad you're back.

309
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,910
Ah! Shut up.

310
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,329
Calm down.

311
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,039
Oh.

312
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:27,768
Coming through.

313
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,519
We can't call it a night just yet.

314
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,021
Oh, it's freezing.

315
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,523
- What's this, a funeral?
- Come on, let's go.

316
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,317
- Hey!
- Easy.

317
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,569
Hey, you fucking bastard!

318
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,654
What?

319
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,490
- What did you say?
- Hey, calm down. What do you want?

320
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,867
What did you say
as you were walking past me?

321
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:45,369
Come on, what's wrong with you?

322
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,787
What the fuck did you say?

323
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,664
Come up, four down.

324
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,834
- Oh!
- Let's go, let's go.

325
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,586
Hey, pass it. Pass the ball!

326
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,421
Hey, over here!

327
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,173
I'm open.

328
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,550
What was that? You suck.

329
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:03,512
- No, no, no. I'm open.
- I'm wide open.

330
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,347
Over here!

331
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,682
- No!
- Pass it.

332
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,600
- Here.
- What was that?

333
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,738
Oh, my god. Let's go.

334
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,491
He pushed him. The guy just pushed him.

335
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,368
He pushed him, I saw.
Did you see that?

336
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,661
That asshole pushed him!

337
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,043
Hey, fuck you!

338
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,423
Don't push me! Let go of me!

339
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:06,491
WE ARE CLOSED TEMPORARILY.
WE WILL REOPEN SOON.

340
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,285
<i>As the year comes to an end,</i>

341
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,287
<i>we often hope
that things would be different.</i>

342
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,538
<i>We say,</i>

343
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,082
<i>"I wish for only good things
to happen in the new year."</i>

344
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,376
<i>But remember, dear listener,</i>

345
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,878
<i>if the weather's always sunny,</i>

346
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,921
<i>our world would turn into a desert.</i>

347
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,508
<i>Snow and rain, they nourish the soil.</i>

348
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,801
<i>Without water,</i>

349
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,887
<i>all the plants and trees,
and eventually, everything</i>

350
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,055
<i>would wither and die.</i>

351
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,307
<i>So we'll make our wishes for the new year.</i>

352
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,392
<i>How about we change things up?</i>

353
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,480
<i>I'd like some good things
to happen in my life.</i>

354
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,066
<i>Some good is enough.</i>

355
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,651
<i>What about the big companies?</i>

356
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,986
<i>You didn't get into any of them?</i>

357
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,447
- No.
- Hmm.

358
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,783
Your grades are pretty good.

359
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:50,952
Hiring managers used to line up
to recruit our students.

360
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,121
What's happening this year?

361
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,334
Let's see.

362
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,129
There are two places
where you can start working right away.

363
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:02,881
One of them...

364
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,549
Have you heard of the company, Gwangjang?

365
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,927
- Oh, what do they do?
- Newsletter editing.

366
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,721
This is a full-time position.

367
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,973
They're offering 15 million won a year.

368
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,684
- They're looking for a literature major...
- Ah, I see.

369
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,895
...from our school, so...
so you'll get the job.

370
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,481
The other option is...

371
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,149
a part-time job in radio.

372
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,068
It only goes for a couple of months.

373
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:26,655
Oh, it's that show
hosted by Yoo Yeol.

374
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:35,038
When you hear that melody, it's 9:20 a.m.

375
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,374
After that, he reads off a script
written by someone else.

376
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,792
And you can totally tell.

377
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:41,545
Ooh, then you hear the theme song
by Kim Kwang-jin at 10 a.m.

378
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,464
Okay, you need to take that job
at the radio station.

379
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,591
I know nothing about radio shows.

380
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,510
Hello.

381
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,929
Forget it.

382
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,140
I'll just listen to the show
at a different job.

383
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,142
Oh, you know, fun fact.

384
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:59,271
Yoo Yeol started hosting the show
on October 1, 1994.

385
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:04,568
Stop. How in the world
could you remember something like that?

386
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,112
Yeah, I know, right?

387
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,572
After all this time.

388
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,410
Are you sure?

389
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,579
Yeah, I'm sure.

390
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,291
You need a stable job.

391
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,917
Stable?

392
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:24,171
No, it's "safe."

393
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,923
Okay, I know it's safer

394
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,842
than the part-time job
at the radio station.

395
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,469
Well, thanks.

396
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,731
I just think it's crazy
to have someone else

397
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,275
pack up your stuff for a move, you know?

398
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,027
The movers that packed your house for you,

399
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,195
they're all gonna go under.

400
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,864
They charge three times more
than what we do.

401
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,866
Why would anyone hire them?

402
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:57,579
Moving gives you a chance
to go through everything you own.

403
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,750
You could finally get rid
of the crap you never use.

404
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,711
Give me that. It's heavy.

405
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:05,879
If you don't do it yourself,

406
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,589
how're you gonna know where everything is?

407
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,132
Right, totally.

408
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,384
- Oh, man.
- You're right.

409
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,470
What's with you, man?
You... You're so distracted.

410
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,431
Well, I'm pretty sure I've heard you
say that at least five times today.

411
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,267
You are the master of your own life.

412
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,812
That's why you need to pack
your own stuff, huh?

413
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,400
Here, take these to Mr. Kim's bookstore.

414
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,860
- Oh, these two?
- Yeah.

415
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,407
I'm coming!

416
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:39,496
I gave you a little extra.

417
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:42,582
This is so good.

418
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,626
- Isn't it? It's just for you.
- Mm.

419
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,586
- We're ready to pay.
- Of course.

420
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,671
Bye now.

421
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,006
Nine thousand won.

422
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,258
Thank you.

423
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:54,135
I just got a job.

424
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:56,012
Really?

425
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,348
- That's my girl.
- I'm gonna be a writer.

426
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,935
Awesome!

427
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,228
Oh, sorry.

428
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,942
So, will you make a fortune

429
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:11,278
now that you've got yourself a job?

430
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,737
I'm gonna be super rich.

431
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,248
That's nice.

432
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,000
What?

433
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,380
- You paid my tuition fees.
- Enough, come on.

434
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,423
Stop.

435
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,967
You spent that little bit
of savings you had

436
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,635
from the bakery on me.

437
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,180
We're family.

438
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,020
Thanks, Eun-ja.

439
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,438
Don't mention it.

440
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:50,859
What?

441
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,152
That's my fat.

442
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,030
All that good food.

443
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,783
I'm proud of you.

444
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,123
- Good evening.
- Oh, you're back?

445
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,082
Yep.

446
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,125
USED BOOKS

447
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,212
I'm back.

448
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,297
Hey, Hyeon-u.

449
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,301
Li-sik asked me to drop these off.

450
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,344
Okay.

451
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,762
Good evening.

452
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,388
Oh, hi.

453
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,141
Hyeon-u,
could you take my mother home?

454
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,478
Thank you.

455
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,105
I'm practically blind at night.

456
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,608
But I can see everything during the day.

457
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:33,777
All right.

458
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,323
I'm serious.
My vision is just fine in the daytime.

459
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,658
Yup.

460
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:55,340
What's with all these red flags?

461
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:59,094
They're going to build apartments here.

462
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:01,304
Oh.

463
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,895
MISU BAKERY

464
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,732
BREAD

465
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,110
Mom.

466
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,990
I got a job.

467
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,413
I'll come back soon.

468
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,417
I'll do visit you, I promise.

469
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,462
Mi-su?

470
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:35,713
Hm?

471
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,428
Oh, Hyeon-u!

472
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,722
- Who is she?
- Oh, uh...

473
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,890
Oh, good evening.

474
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,767
Uh, she's...

475
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,185
So, do you...

476
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,563
Yes, I live here in this neighborhood.

477
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,356
Oh. Oh.

478
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,108
- Okay, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

479
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,526
I, uh...

480
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,986
I have to take her home first.

481
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,612
Uh, do you mind waiting here?

482
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,905
Oh, all right.

483
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:03,408
- Don't go anywhere.
- Get home safely.

484
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,617
Thank you.

485
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:11,833
Hm?

486
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,714
Did you run here?

487
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,675
No.

488
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,093
Can you tell?

489
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,804
How have you been?

490
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,390
I have some good news.

491
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,270
I got my GED.

492
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,148
You did?

493
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:36,649
You kept studying.

494
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,401
Mm-hm.

495
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,945
I'm impressed. I'm proud of you.

496
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,865
Eun-ja's gonna be so happy.

497
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,284
Oh, she's running her own noodle shop.

498
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,870
I miss Eun-ja too.

499
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,415
If you happen to be free tomorrow,

500
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,335
how about we go see her?

501
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,630
Uh...

502
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,258
- Well...
- Mm-hm?

503
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,600
I start my military service tomorrow.

504
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,312
Uh... Oh.

505
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,064
Really?

506
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,693
You must be tired.

507
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,362
No, I'm fine.

508
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,947
You don't need to walk me home.

509
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,490
It's okay.

510
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,832
When I woke up this morning,

511
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,583
I never imagined my day
would end like this.

512
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,003
I'm so happy
I decided to visit the bakery.

513
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,757
It's like I got my own little miracle.

514
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,682
This is it. This is where I live.

515
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,268
- Right here?
- Yup.

516
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,311
Ah.

517
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,357
Well...

518
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,610
Uh, thanks for walking me home.

519
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:04,988
Of course.

520
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,993
I'm happy...

521
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,160
Huh?

522
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,787
...that I ran into you today.

523
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,163
Me too.

524
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:17,959
Well...

525
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,670
Be safe out there, okay?

526
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,297
Mm-hm.

527
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,384
Good night.

528
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,499
Hyeon-u!

529
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,259
I must be nervous.

530
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,345
I entered my number wrong.

531
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,639
Your number?

532
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:14,599
Yeah, I use my student ID number.

533
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,643
It's the only thing i can remember.

534
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,479
Oh, your school gives you a number.

535
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,940
Ah, it's not a big deal.

536
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,150
Are you cold?

537
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,486
Hm?

538
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,029
Just wait here for a second.

539
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,906
Don't come in until I tell you to, okay?

540
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,742
All right.

541
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,752
Okay.

542
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,596
Come in.

543
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:06,484
This is all I've got in the house.

544
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,371
Are you okay?

545
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,500
- Uh...
- What... How did that happen?

546
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,460
Uh, thanks.

547
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:26,254

- I got it. I got it.

548
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,964
Do you want... I can get you a new shirt.

549
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:29,841
Hold on.

550
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:31,259
Uh...

551
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,931
Hey, don't worry about it.

552
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,913
This blanket looks thin,
but it'll keep you warm.

553
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,499
Uh...

554
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,252
Ow.

555
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,379
Oh, my god.

556
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,548
I'm sorry. You okay?

557
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,967
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- I didn't know you were behind me.

558
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,193
Hyeon-u, is everything okay?

559
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,403
Uh... yeah.

560
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,576
Oh.

561
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,620
Those are Eun-ja's pajamas.

562
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,371
Eun-ja...

563
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,498
These are Eun-ja's?

564
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,958
Sorry. I'm sorry.

565
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,176
Uh...

566
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:56,094
What's wrong?

567
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,054
- Is it the shirt?
- Uh, yeah.

568
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,514
Let me see.

569
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:00,723
Uh...

570
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,695
All done.

571
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,000
Hyeon-u.

572
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,169
Are you asleep?

573
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,339
No.

574
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,930
That day...

575
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,103
I thought...

576
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,235
that I would never see you again, but...

577
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,697
I tried to...

578
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,912

Back then...

581
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,731
we got into a fight with this drunk guy.

582
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,154
I was with Tae-seong.

583
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:46,495
And, uh, my probation was revoked.

584
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,459
So...

585
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,924
I had to go back to the juvenile center.

586
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,099
I wanted to come back to the bakery.

587
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:11,729
So badly.

588
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,648

Just check your inbox for my e-mails.

- Yeah?

625
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:32,781
Meet your successor.

626

Oh, hi. How are you?

627
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,286

00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,734
That's what I've been doing all day.

721
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,037
Your form looks good.

722
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:09,905
<i>Hello?</i>

723
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:11,907
<i>Hyeon-u?</i>

724
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,492
Yeah, it's me.

725
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:15,535
<i>How have you been?</i>

726
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,621
<i>Well, you know me.</i>

727
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,207
<i>Just hard at work.</i>

728
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,043
<i>You're as positive as I remember.</i>

729
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,962
Just hearing your voice
is brightening up my day.

730
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:29,883
<i>I miss you.</i>

731
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,345
<i>Uh, what kind of work
are you doing these days?</i>

732
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,429
<i>Well...</i>

733
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,474
<i>What kind of work do you think I do?</i>

734
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,601
Uh, the kind of work you wanted to do.

735
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,771
<i>Eun-ja always say
you're such a great writer.</i>

736
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,481
It's kind of related.

737
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,568
<i>I'll call you later.
Around 6 p.m., okay?</i>

738
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,487
Oh, uh... Yeah.

739
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,198
<i>Uh, I'll be waiting
for your call.</i>

740
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:55,742
<i>I like to see you.</i>

741
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,244
Mm-hm.

742
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,621
Cool.

743
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,763
<i>The person you are trying to reach</i>

744
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,223
<i>is not available at this time.</i>

745
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,642
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

746
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,157
<i>The person you are trying to reach</i>

747
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,491
<i>is not available...</i>

748
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:51,214
Hey, look at this!

749
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,092
Hey, please be quiet.

750
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:58,555
You took off with the membership fees,
which are four million won per person.

751
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,016
And there are over a hundred members.

752
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:05,020
These days, so many fitness clubs
change their names,

753
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:07,439
just so they can get new members
and can scam them.

754
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,524
Sir, we told you,
we don't know what happened.

755
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,027
I don't know anything.
I just work there part-time.

756
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,737
Sir...

757
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,114
I, uh, really didn't do anything wrong.

758
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:18,492
When, when the fight broke out,

759
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:19,785
I, uh...

760
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,329
I didn't hit anyone.
I didn't even fight back.

761
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,624
Please, I'm in college now.

762
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:28,084
- I didn't do anything--
- Uh, I can't hear you. Speak up.

763
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,096
Hyeon-u.

764
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,932
- Hyeon-u!
- Hyeon-u!

765
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:43,266
Hey!

766
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,976
Hey, man, thanks for keeping me out of it.

767
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,436
- Hey, hold on.
- Where are you going?

768
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,687
Hey, let's grab a drink.

769
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:50,315
- Hey, man.
- Come on, man.

770
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,650
- Thanks for taking care of that.
- Hold up, hold up.

771
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:53,902
Hey, you know, I was just trying
to help you out, right?

772
00:51:54,569 --> 00:51:56,404
Tae-seong stuck his neck out for you.

773
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:59,241
And he got you that job
'cause you said you needed some cash.

774
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,283
Dude, don't be so salty.

775
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:01,660
The owner lied to Tae-seong too.

776
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,911
Yeah?

777
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,372
Can you please just leave me alone?

778
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,498
What the hell?

779
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,500
So you're just gonna ditch us?

780
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,543
- Huh?
- Where you going?

781
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,670
- Yo.
- Seriously?

782
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,129
Hey!

783
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,589
Hey.

784
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,967
Fuck you. It's not like
Tae-seong did it on purpose.

785
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,260
Hey, Hyeon-u!

786
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,514
MI-SU, I'M SO SORRY
I MISSED YOUR CALL EARLIER

787
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,599
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH
EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T MY FAULT

788
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,809
<i>Hey, open up!</i>

789
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,102
You!

790
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:28,603
Oh, watch out!

791
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,689
- What's going on?
- Getting away from us, huh?

792
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,316
- I want my money!
- I want my money back.

793
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:38,196
MI-SU, I'M SO SORRY
I MISSED YOUR CALL EARLIER

794
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:49,040
MI-SU

795
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,048
CLOSE

796
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,638
43 MINUTES AND 33 SECONDS

797
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,478
<i>Something must've come up.</i>

798
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,149
<i>But...</i>

799
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,944
<i>I'm kinda thankful
that I didn't hear from you.</i>

800
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:20,822
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

801
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,159
<i>I feel like a total loser these days.</i>

802
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,830
<i>I'm not really in the mood to catch up
and laugh with you</i>

803
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,332
<i>after all these years.</i>

804
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,918
<i>I hate myself.</i>

805
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:36,171
<i>I don't even want people to look at me.</i>

806
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:39,925
<i>I'm sad.</i>

807
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:45,847
<i>I made all these choices myself,
so why do I feel this way?</i>

808
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:53,146
<i>There's only one thing
that made me happy recently.</i>

809
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,566
<i>You figuring out the password.</i>

810
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,488
<i>Thanks to you, I got to laugh
for the first time in a long time.</i>

811
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:06,409
<i>Hyeon-u, get in touch
when something good happens.</i>

812
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,162
<i>And I'll do the same.</i>

813
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:40,819
<i>♪ Why is it so hard to start the day ♪</i>

814
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:45,699
<i>♪ Should I take it easy
With a cup of coffee ♪</i>

815
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:50,829
<i>♪ A grateful cup of coffee
That can wake me up ♪</i>

816
00:54:51,162 --> 00:54:57,836
<i>♪ The smell of freesias
When I walk out the door ♪</i>

817
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,462
All right, dear listeners.

818
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,091
Today, we're gonna do something
to fulfill our intellectual curiosity.

819
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,135
In this segment,
we're gonna learn about a new book

820
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,137
and meet its author. Mr. Jeong Su-man,

821
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,556
the author
of <i>Charming People and Their Travels</i>,

822
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:10,807
is in the studio.

823
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,100
- Good morning!
- Hi.

824
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:15,270
I'm Jeong Su-man, the author
of <i>Charming People, Their Travels</i>.

825
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,938
You know,
I couldn't help but notice.

826
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,815
Are you feeling
a little nervous right now?

827
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:21,067
Well, this is my first time
on a radio station.

828
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,027
Uh-huh.

829
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:24,195
I drank so much water
that I have to keep going to the restroom.

830
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,613
Oh, I see.

831
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,907
Mi-su, you're allowed to talk here.

832
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:29,993
What?

833
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:31,411
Oh.

834
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,787
Come on, don't be so shy.

835
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,290
Well, I thought maybe the microphone
would pick me up.

836
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,958
Your friend's pretty funny.

837
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,754
I swear, when I imagined...

838
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,672
Yoo Yeol's studio,

839
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,507
I always pictured it
looking very different.

840
00:55:45,133 --> 00:55:47,385
I thought he looked out an actual window,

841
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,637
because he was always so detailed
with his descriptions.

842
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,309
Uh, can I give them the, uh...

843
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,314
I brought these for you.

844
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,066
Here.

845
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,653
Look who's back. It's Mi-su.

846
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,654
Hi.

847
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:09,908
- I'm back.
- Oh, nice work, Mi-su.

848
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,454
Mr. Jeong sounded so nervous on the show.

849
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,539
He made me nervous.

850
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,416
- I know, right.
- Hm.

851
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,509
Well...

852
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,136
- Did you take some photos?
- Yeah, I did.

853
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,263
If my mom hadn't shown up out of nowhere

854
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,807
and taken up half my day,

855
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,642
I could've made it to the radio station.

856
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,436
See if you could give him more interviews.

857
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,813
- Sure, okay.
- I'm serious.

858
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:40,730
I'm on it.

859
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,732
- I'll give you a bonus.
- Yes, sir.

860
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:44,442
I know you're all talk.

861
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:48,071
Back to work.

862
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:49,823
Okay, see you later.

863
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,990
Mm.

864
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,745
Hey, who's moving into the space upstairs?

865
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,163
I'm not sure.

866
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,290
They make movies or something like that.

867
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,459
The boss knows one of them.

868
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,669
Ah.

869
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,172
They're just some college kids
working on a project.

870
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:09,467
Apparently, their goal
is to make their dreams come true.

871
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,846
That's been everyone's obsession
since the World Cup, hasn't it?

872
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,226
20TH CENTURY BOY

873
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,984
What are you doing here?

874
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:29,154
Oh, I've been waiting for you.

875
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,239
Did something happen?

876
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,699
Something amazing.

877
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,075
- Oh?
- Come on.

878
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,160
Uh...

879
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:37,412
- No, it's okay. Have a good night.
- No, no, no, come on.

880
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,290
I have to take you somewhere.

881
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,332
- Where?
- Come on.

882
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,876
Let's go.

883
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,714
KYOBO BOOK CENTER

884
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,597
- Did you see it?
- See what?

885
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:56,973
Oh, you don't see it?

886
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,183
- Huh?
- Huh?

887
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,107
Oh!

888
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,901
CHARMING PEOPLE, THEIR TRAVELS

889
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,111
Is that our book?

890
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,113
The book we published
has made it to number six.

891
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,114
Oh!

892
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,243
Congratulations, this is huge.

893
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,788
Oh, come on.
After all this work, that's it, huh?

894
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:23,500
I've never seen you more stressed out.

895
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:25,585
You acted like the whole world
was coming to an end.

896
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,630
Come on, let it out. Show me how you feel.

897
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,257
Yeah!

898
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:34,719
The book I published
made it to number six!

899
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:37,055
Yeah! Whoo!

900
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,098
- Yeah!
- Yes!

901
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,725
This is awesome!

902
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,060
This is awesome!

903
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:44,896
- This is awesome! Number six!
- Yeah.

904
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,315
Hey!

905
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,276
You did good.

906
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:20,014
<i>As I sit in this new studio</i>

907
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,683
<i>overlooking Yeouido Park,</i>

908
00:59:22,433 --> 00:59:25,270
<i>the sunlight, uh, feels so strong,</i>

909
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:27,605
<i>yet it holds me in its warmth.</i>

910
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:31,317
<i>And I'm reminded
how lucky I am, dear listeners.</i>

911
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:36,281
<i>So, I want all of you to think about</i>

912
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:38,533
<i>someone you may have left behind.</i>

913
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,743
<i>Somebody special in your life.</i>

914
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,370
Sounds like he got his window.

915
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,372
<i>Think of them and let the sun</i>

916
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,124
- <i>carry your thoughts to them.</i>
- Hm.

917
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,084
<i>On this beautiful day.</i>

918
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,670
<i>From this day forward,
Yoo Yeol's</i> Music Album...

919
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,130
- Good morning!
- <i>...will be broadcast</i>

920
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,008
<i>From an open studio,
overlooking the splendid park.</i>

921
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:57,677
<i>Where the sun filters through the trees.</i>

922
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,431
<i>It's gonna be hard for me to focus
on the show today.</i>

923
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,308
<i>I'll be too busy gazing on my window.</i>

924
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:05,226
<i>And to all of you out there,</i>

925
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:07,395
<i>Yoo Yeol's</i> Music Album
is starting right now.

926
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:17,947
When I first started this company,

927
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,116
it was just a place for me
and a couple friends

928
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,076
to work on projects for fun.

929
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,161
But in just two years,

930
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,288
we've managed to publish
a best-selling book.

931
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,956
Let this not be our last.

932
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,042

01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,584
Hm.

950
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,466
I should be heading home.

951
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:03,177
Yeah.

952
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,638

- Hmm...
- Oh.

963
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:04,864
Oh...

964
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,747
Uh, wait, it's...

965
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:20,922
Why are we here?

966
01:03:22,298 --> 01:03:23,758
I'm renting this place.

967
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:26,969
No, I mean...

968
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,763
How is this possible?

969
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,473
Oh.

970
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:33,684
Well, I've always liked this apartment.

971
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,729
It was available and within my budget.

972
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,190
So I signed the lease.

973
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,824
When I saw you today,

974
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,451
I didn't know what to say at first,

975
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,912
because there are so many things
I wanna tell you,

976
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,790
but I can't remember any of them.

977
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:02,213
I'm glad to see you again.

978
01:04:02,296 --> 01:04:04,257
What?

979
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,466
Uh, nothing.

980
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,927
I'M TAKING 3 DAYS OFF

981
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,558
Hm.

982
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:26,112
I think we should make some kimchi stew.

983
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:27,738
Uh, okay.

984
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,449
Kimchi stew and, uh, stir-fried pork.

985
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,785
Yeah, let's make omelet rice too.
I know how.

986
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,203
That'll be too much work.

987
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:36,122
I'll do it. Just go relax.

988
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:37,957
No way, that's too much for one person.

989
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,167
We should've bought minced garlic.

990
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,335
This is just...

991
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,337
- I'll mince the garlic.
- Are you sure? 'Cause...

992
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,214
- I'll do it.
- That's a lot of garlic.

993
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,341
- I'll mince all the garlic.
- Well...

994
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,930
Are you sure you wanna do everything
by yourself?

995
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:56,058
Yeah, go take a shower.

996
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:59,729
All right, then.

997
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,741
Hyeon-u,
did you turn on the water?

998
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:14,660
What?

999
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,621
Are you running the water
in the kitchen?

1000
01:05:17,371 --> 01:05:18,456
Yeah?

1001
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,750
If you do that,
the water turns ice cold.

1002
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:32,637
Cheers.

1003
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:34,972
Thanks for cooking.

1004
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:41,187
Ahh.

1005
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:52,531
Is it good?

1006
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,699
Mm, mm-hm.

1007
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,868
This is so good.

1008
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,078
Wow.

1009
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:07,171
When I was living here,

1010
01:06:07,588 --> 01:06:09,840
there was a huge patch of mold
on that wall.

1011
01:06:11,592 --> 01:06:13,386
So, you had no idea that...

1012
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:16,097
if you run the kitchen sink,
the shower gets cold?

1013
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:20,101
I mean, I get it because you live alone.

1014
01:06:20,893 --> 01:06:23,896
I guess you've never brought
a girlfriend back here before.

1015
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,567
I'm not gonna tell you.
Just eat your food.

1016
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:32,405
I am eating.

1017
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:36,283
One sec.

1018
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,423
Huh?

1019
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:54,051
What are all these?

1020
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,525
I only have
a handful of happy memories.

1021
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:12,778
But some of them,

1022
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:16,157
I just can't recall the details.

1023
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,201
They don't even feel like they're my own.

1024
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:24,540
I almost can't believe
that those things actually happened to me.

1025
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,004
I took those photos so I wouldn't forget.

1026
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:46,687
Oh.

1027
01:07:47,271 --> 01:07:48,898
You scared me.

1028
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:54,987
You take good care of me.

1029
01:08:01,535 --> 01:08:02,620
Hmm.

1030
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,379
Are you still scared of me?

1031
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,424
Hm?

1032
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:18,302
You were scared of me when we first met.

1033
01:08:19,386 --> 01:08:21,472
Mm-mm.

1034
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,777
How about now?

1035
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:40,282
Mm-mm.

1036
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:50,459
Still not scared?

1037
01:11:12,643 --> 01:11:13,936

1050
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,925
I have about three pages left.

1051
01:12:27,509 --> 01:12:29,636
You're a slow reader.

1052
01:12:32,056 --> 01:12:33,474
Back when you were a kid,

1053
01:12:34,099 --> 01:12:36,852
did you ride motorcycles around
like these punks do?

1054
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:38,312
I have, in the past.

1055
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,522
Hm. Mm-hm.

1056
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:43,817
With a girl sitting on the back?

1057
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:45,319
No.

1058
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:48,947
You're such a liar.

1059
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:58,165
Oh, stop.

1060
01:13:06,673 --> 01:13:08,300
You finished? Give me that.

1061
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,302
Hm.

1062
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:18,268
I don't wanna see
Eun-ja like this.

1063
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:21,855
My mom really cared about her.

1064
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:25,109
She wanted Eun-ja to marry a nice man,

1065
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,653
and start a family of her own.

1066
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:30,364
I told her to follow her heart
and not settle,

1067
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:34,243
but she insisted she wanted to marry
that old man with a kid.

1068
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:37,204
Go on in. I'll wait here.

1069
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,707
Can't you just come with me?

1070
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:43,210
Hm?

1071
01:13:43,293 --> 01:13:44,378
Come on, let's go.

1072
01:13:45,212 --> 01:13:46,380
Um...

1073
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:47,548
Maybe next time.

1074
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:49,508
Go on.

1075
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:50,926
All right.

1076
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:53,220
Just go.

1077
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,222
No, I'm just gonna wait here.

1078
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:57,099
- Let's just go together, hm?
- Mm-mm.

1079
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:09,445
GEUM-I'S PLACE
NOODLE SOUP

1080
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:17,703
Have a seat anywhere.

1081
01:14:21,331 --> 01:14:22,374
Oh...

1082
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:23,876
Hyeon-u?

1083
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:26,336
Is that you?

1084
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,881
Yes, Eun-ja. It's me.

1085
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:31,341
Oh, my god. Tofu! Tofu!

1086
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,137
Oh!

1087
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,597
Oh, I can't believe it.

1088
01:14:36,805 --> 01:14:39,016
You're even more handsome than I remember.

1089
01:14:39,099 --> 01:14:40,517
Oh, my god!

1090
01:14:40,601 --> 01:14:42,144
Here, have a seat.

1091
01:14:42,227 --> 01:14:43,270
Sit, sit.

1092
01:14:44,104 --> 01:14:45,272
How did you find me?

1093
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,316
Uh, Mi-su, uh...

1094
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:49,401
She didn't want to come, right?

1095
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,240
Miss Eun-ja.

1096
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:57,951
She's... She's in trouble.

1097
01:14:58,035 --> 01:15:00,120
- What?
- She's gonna get beat-up!

1098
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:01,830
Stop! Stop!

1099
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:03,582
Come here.

1100
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,167
Let go!

1101
01:15:05,918 --> 01:15:07,878
Say you're sorry. Do it.

1102
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,340
Apologize.

1103
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,468
I'm sorry.

1104
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,678
- She's here.
- Hey, who is this?

1105
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,934
What? Who am I?

1106
01:15:22,267 --> 01:15:23,227
You little...

1107
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:24,686
Mi-su...

1108
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:27,147
- Mi-su...
- You shouldn't have to deal with this.

1109
01:15:27,773 --> 01:15:29,733
You pretending you don't recognize me?

1110
01:15:29,816 --> 01:15:30,859
Mi-su?

1111
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,612
I caught her smoking.

1112
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:40,452
Your stepmom
is the best chef in the world,

1113
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,329
but she's stuck
in that restaurant all day long

1114
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:44,915
making noodle soup because of you,
you understand?

1115
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:46,833
We'll talk later.

1116
01:15:46,917 --> 01:15:48,794
- Everything's fine.
- Don't do this.

1117
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,089
It's okay.

1118
01:15:53,257 --> 01:15:56,134
I've missed you.

1119
01:15:56,885 --> 01:15:58,679
Why do you let her
treat you this way?

1120
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:00,472
Where's the Eun-ja I know?

1121
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,641
She would've never let this happen.

1122
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:13,235
All right, dinner is served.

1123
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:15,821
This is two-year-old kimchi.

1124
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:18,365
I only serve this to a few special people.

1125
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:19,700
You can take some home with you.

1126
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:20,909
Wow.

1127
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:23,537
You can have more after you finish this.

1128
01:16:24,371 --> 01:16:25,289
Here.

1129
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,457
- Hm?
- Looks good.

1130
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,169
Thank you for the food.

1131
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,351
- You like it?
- Yup. Delicious.

1132
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,396
- The soup is amazing.
- Do you want more pepper?

1133
01:16:49,479 --> 01:16:50,314
Mm-mm.

1134
01:16:50,647 --> 01:16:51,815
Try it with the kimchi.

1135
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,278
Don't you think it's weird that Eun-ja

1136
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,780
didn't even ask
if we're seeing each other?

1137
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,116
I mean, she doesn't have to.

1138
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:02,784
I just wonder why she didn't bring it up.

1139
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,123
Honestly, it doesn't matter to me.

1140
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,042
Hm?

1141
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:15,297
We can be together or take it slow,
it's whatever you want.

1142
01:17:19,092 --> 01:17:21,637
So it's up to me what we do, huh?

1143
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,764
Are you sure you want me
to make this decision?

1144
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:29,603
MI-SU!

1145
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:32,648
ARE YOU AT WORK NOW?

1146
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:37,944
YES, I'M IN THE OFFICE

1147
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:41,156
DIDN'T YOU SAY THERE'S A MEDIA VENTURE
OR SOMETHING ABOVE YOUR OFFICE?

1148
01:17:41,239 --> 01:17:42,240
WHY DO YOU ASK?

1149
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:46,328
WE NEED A PART-TIMER
FOR OUR LIVE VIDEO STREAMING

1150
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,376
I KNOW OF A GOOD PART-TIMER

1151
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:53,710
IS HE HANDSOME?

1152
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,216
YOU'D BETTER NOT MAKE A MOVE ON HIM

1153
01:17:59,299 --> 01:18:01,093
FINE

1154
01:18:06,598 --> 01:18:08,100
What are you doing?

1155
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:10,394
Uh...

1156
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:14,398
I'm getting ready to develop the film,
but it's kinda tricky.

1157
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:19,736
Hey, Hyeon-u.

1158
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:24,074
What do you think about
this Pepsi T-shirt that I'm wearing?

1159
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:26,785
I think it looks great on you.

1160
01:18:27,494 --> 01:18:30,247
So then will you give it to me
if I say that I want it?

1161
01:18:31,832 --> 01:18:32,708
Sure.

1162
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:35,669
Smile.

1163
01:18:38,171 --> 01:18:39,548
What? What?

1164
01:18:40,132 --> 01:18:42,092
<i>Hey, I have a question for you.</i>

1165
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,346
How is it...

1166
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:48,515
that you have such an adorable smile?

1167
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:53,937
Is that a genuine smile?

1168
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:57,065
Or is he just trying really hard?

1169
01:18:58,108 --> 01:18:59,484
I ask this, because,

1170
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:03,447
when you feel like a loser,
everyone else also looks...

1171
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:06,700
like a loser,
and your whole world looks like shit.

1172
01:19:09,286 --> 01:19:11,830
I'd want more from life
if I had more to begin with.

1173
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:17,085
There are very few things in this life
that I hold dear.

1174
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:19,045
Hm.

1175
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,799
But I'm staring at one right now.

1176
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:26,970
Go on.

1177
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:29,765
To me, at least...

1178
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,311
you're the most wonderful...

1179
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:37,606
beautiful person in the whole world.

1180
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,452
That's so sweet.

1181
01:19:52,412 --> 01:19:54,581
This coffee's so sugary, I feel dizzy.

1182
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,210
Coffee is best when it's sweet.

1183
01:20:36,331 --> 01:20:37,374
You go ahead.

1184
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,292
What?

1185
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:42,420
I'll be right up, okay?

1186
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,465
Uh...

1187
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:51,513
Do you wanna get married?

1188
01:20:56,601 --> 01:20:58,353
I guess this is how guys feel.

1189
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:01,690
I said that without even realizing
what I was saying.

1190
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,776
I'm just kidding,
so just forget what you heard.

1191
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,117
- Let's go inside.
- Mm.

1192
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:12,636
In your old neighborhood,

1193
01:22:13,011 --> 01:22:14,721
there was an apartment complex over here.

1194
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:17,557
And the hair salon was here.

1195
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:21,811
There's a real estate agency
where the bakery used to be.

1196
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:25,523
Uh, if you turn right
at the corner of the convenience store

1197
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:26,733
and keep walking,

1198
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,569
you get to the old corner store, remember?

1199
01:22:30,028 --> 01:22:33,156
Uh, I'm sorry, what are you trying to say?

1200
01:22:34,366 --> 01:22:35,367
Didn't I...

1201
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,869
Didn't I tell you?

1202
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:40,705
Oh, I guess I forgot to tell you.

1203
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:43,416
I've decided to buy this store.

1204
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:47,295
Gonna open a bakery there,
and it will offer cooking classes.

1205
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:49,714
The classroom should be fairly large,

1206
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:51,341
the store has a good amount of space.

1207
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:53,718
You could help me.

1208
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,847
Huh?

1209
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:02,185
What do you... you think?

1210
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,361
I promise to make you smile every day.

1211
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,196
If that's what you want.

1212
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:18,535
You sound so cheesy right now.

1213
01:23:37,137 --> 01:23:37,971
Hyeon-u!

1214
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:54,696
I'm returning these.

1215
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:56,698
You can just leave them there.

1216
01:23:56,781 --> 01:23:57,782
- Have a good one.
- You too.

1217
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:23,933
Hello.

1218
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:26,895
<i>Why didn't you answer my calls?</i>

1219
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:38,656
<i>I guess you're too busy
living a normal life.</i>

1220
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:42,911
<i>You know, today's the ten-year anniversary
of Jeong-hyeop's death, huh?</i>

1221
01:24:45,330 --> 01:24:48,750
<i>You, of all people,
should pay your respects.</i>

1222
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:54,422
<i>We're leaving in the afternoon.
We'll wait for you.</i>

1223
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,317
Come on, make it quick.

1224
01:25:14,651 --> 01:25:16,111
Hey, don't tell me what to do, okay?

1225
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:18,905
- You didn't do anything today.
- Yo, why me? What's the matter with you?

1226
01:25:18,988 --> 01:25:20,448
Can one of you just do it? I'm tired.

1227
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,075
Rock, paper, scissors.

1228
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:23,618
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Real men use their fists.

1229
01:25:23,701 --> 01:25:24,869
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Everyone, put your hand in.

1230
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:25,912
One, two, three.

1231
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:28,832
- Hey, are you playing?
- Let's play without him, come on.

1232
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:29,749
Okay, you ready?

1233
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,292
- One, two, three, shoot!
- Shoot!

1234
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:32,919
- One, two, three, shoot!
- Shoot!

1235
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:34,170
Goddamn it!

1236
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,681
- Hey!
- Oh, shit!

1237
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:47,308
You...

1238
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,400
Fuck! Guys, she saw me.

1239
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:07,036
What do you want?

1240
01:26:08,454 --> 01:26:10,582
I got my GED and went to college.

1241
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,001
I got a job in the city.

1242
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:16,754
If Jeong-hyeop were alive,

1243
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:20,550
he would have graduated
and be working too.

1244
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:24,470
The fact that you and your friends
aren't behind bars...

1245
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,347
that makes me sick to my stomach.

1246
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:29,475
You don't deserve a good life.

1247
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:32,562
You guys should be locked up

1248
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:34,397
so you can never do this to anyone again.

1249
01:26:36,232 --> 01:26:38,151
It was an accident.

1250
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,369
I beg you, forgive me.

1251
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:53,499
Please, I'm sorry.

1252
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:56,294
I...

1253
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:00,548
I don't care.

1254
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:04,969
When you die, apologize to him yourself.

1255
01:27:22,195 --> 01:27:23,196
See you around.

1256
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,886
Ah, shit.

1257
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,227
Where are you?
I'm waiting for you outside,

1258
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,645
it's about to rain.

1259
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:57,730
<i>Are you Hyeon-u's girlfriend?</i>

1260
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,358
Well...

1261
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:03,403
Who is this? Who am I talking to?

1262
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,655
<i>He left his phone in my car.</i>

1263
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:09,492
Uh...

1264
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,035
Why was he in your...

1265
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:12,704
Tell me where you are.

1266
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:14,956
I'll bring it to you.

1267
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:24,841
Oh, yeah.

1268
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:27,719
Aren't you that girl from the bakery?

1269
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,930
Not that Hyeon-u would tell me anyway.

1270
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:39,731
Uh...

1271
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:50,241
Hm.

1272
01:28:58,833 --> 01:29:00,376
There it is.

1273
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,258
What did you do... today?

1274
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:09,510
Um...

1275
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:12,096
I went to my aunt's place
to see my grandma.

1276
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,141
Well, I wish that you had told me.

1277
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:16,517
Sorry.

1278
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:17,643
I got distracted.

1279
01:29:18,811 --> 01:29:21,147
I'll be right back.

1280
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:22,440
Okay.

1281
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:33,868
Hyeon-u.

1282
01:29:35,953 --> 01:29:36,996
We have to move.

1283
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:41,834
Jong-u's starting
a new business or something.

1284
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:45,129
Uh, where are we gonna go?

1285
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:50,551
I'm getting so tired of this.

1286
01:29:50,718 --> 01:29:52,303
The movie is never gonna get made.

1287
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:55,473
We can't afford to keep jumping
from office to office.

1288
01:29:55,556 --> 01:29:57,308
It's just setting back our timeline.

1289
01:29:58,184 --> 01:29:59,727
Pretty messed up, don't you think?

1290
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:02,772
Uh, what about the radio station?

1291
01:30:03,731 --> 01:30:05,191
Think that'll be okay with you

1292
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:06,442
working there?

1293
01:30:08,152 --> 01:30:09,070
Hey.

1294
01:30:11,364 --> 01:30:14,450
So, uh, have you started looking
for a new office?

1295
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:17,370
No, not yet.

1296
01:30:17,787 --> 01:30:20,123
I see. Sorry it happened this way.

1297
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:22,208
You'll be fine, though.

1298
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:24,252
You're still young,
you have time to start over.

1299
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:29,215
You know what, I gotta get outta here.

1300
01:30:29,298 --> 01:30:30,508
Mm-hm.

1301
01:30:30,633 --> 01:30:31,801
See you later.

1302
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:40,476
What was Mi-su like when you knew her?

1303
01:30:41,144 --> 01:30:42,603
Was she pretty then too?

1304
01:30:43,646 --> 01:30:45,314
She's always been cranky, right?

1305
01:30:46,774 --> 01:30:47,775
I don't know.

1306
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,584
- Wow.
- Hey!

1307
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:08,588
Hey, stop it! It's really dangerous.

1308
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:15,553
Hey, kids. Be careful.

1309
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:17,054
Yes, sir.

1310
01:31:24,478 --> 01:31:25,521
You scared me.

1311
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,415
This is it.

1312
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:46,477
Ta-da.

1313
01:32:47,395 --> 01:32:48,479
Wow!

1314
01:32:50,064 --> 01:32:51,899
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

1315
01:32:57,822 --> 01:32:59,657
- Is it good?
- It's great.

1316
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:03,202
- You should eat.
- Mm-hm.

1317
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:13,671
I went to see...

1318
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,092
Jeong-hyeop's sister has moved away.

1319
01:33:19,385 --> 01:33:20,261
What?

1320
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:23,264
How do you know that?

1321
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:26,726
Well, they're gone.

1322
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:30,813
I spoke to her neighbors,
but none of them know where she went.

1323
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:32,648
Hyeon-u.

1324
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:36,444
You don't need to go
and visit her anymore.

1325
01:33:37,486 --> 01:33:38,446
That was the last time--

1326
01:33:38,529 --> 01:33:39,905
How did you find out about him?

1327
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,244
Tae-seong told me.

1328
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:46,495
Uh...

1329
01:34:09,643 --> 01:34:11,729
I thought everything was okay now.

1330
01:34:13,731 --> 01:34:15,024
What's okay about this?

1331
01:34:17,735 --> 01:34:19,528
Tell me, how is this okay?

1332
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,281
It will never go away.

1333
01:34:23,449 --> 01:34:24,492
You know everything.

1334
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:35,503
Don't go.

1335
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:38,881
You don't have to.

1336
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:46,806
Couldn't you...

1337
01:34:48,557 --> 01:34:49,475
Couldn't you...

1338
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:52,770
have been the one person that didn't know?

1339
01:34:54,980 --> 01:34:56,565
Why do you have to go searching for this?

1340
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,067
How could I not?

1341
01:34:58,401 --> 01:34:59,819
You were never gonna tell me.

1342
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,491
Please...

1343
01:35:05,866 --> 01:35:08,828
I'll forget everything.

1344
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:10,538
I'll forget about all of it,

1345
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:12,790
and you should forget everything
I told you.

1346
01:35:12,873 --> 01:35:14,166
What should I pray for now?

1347
01:35:16,710 --> 01:35:17,670
I...

1348
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:21,298
I always prayed for God
to please just let me live a normal life.

1349
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:24,260
To take this all away.

1350
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:35,896
Then...

1351
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:38,899
when will you be okay?

1352
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,322
When will you stop running?

1353
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,160
When?

1354
01:35:55,541 --> 01:35:58,669
You smell just like
those assholes, you know that?

1355
01:35:58,752 --> 01:36:01,297
You smell like an ashtray!

1356
01:36:51,805 --> 01:36:53,474
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1357
01:36:54,141 --> 01:36:55,142
What the hell?

1358
01:36:58,187 --> 01:37:00,606
The owner of the dojo
won't be happy, right?

1359
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:02,858
You better get out of here.

1360
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,401
Are you insane?

1361
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:24,505
You say you're my best friend, yeah?

1362
01:37:25,881 --> 01:37:27,174
Is life just a game to you?

1363
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,721
No, I take life very seriously.
People die playing games.

1364
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:33,889
"Playing games"?

1365
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,891
You really think that's what happened?

1366
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:37,685
You were there with us.

1367
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:41,021
Whether we were beating someone up
or stealing stuff.

1368
01:37:41,772 --> 01:37:44,942
But do you ever stop to think about us?

1369
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,694
None of us are okay.

1370
01:37:48,362 --> 01:37:49,488
You know...

1371
01:37:50,364 --> 01:37:51,865
I think it's kinda fucked up.

1372
01:37:53,450 --> 01:37:55,369
We all made the same mistake,

1373
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,416
but I feel like only you are forgiven.

1374
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:02,668
Why do you think that is, hm?

1375
01:38:03,127 --> 01:38:04,670
Is it because you think you're better?

1376
01:38:05,588 --> 01:38:07,840
Shut the fuck up,
you know that's not true.

1377
01:38:08,048 --> 01:38:10,259
Maybe you should take a look
at yourself in the mirror.

1378
01:38:10,342 --> 01:38:11,677
You were the one who let him die.

1379
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:28,152
Son of a bitch!

1380
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:30,821
Fucking...

1381
01:39:18,619 --> 01:39:19,662
Hyeon-u?

1382
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:24,792
Are you hurt?

1383
01:39:33,258 --> 01:39:35,052
Can I ask you something?

1384
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,306
Are you and Mi-su...

1385
01:39:40,474 --> 01:39:43,102
really seeing each other?

1386
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:49,942
I'm gonna ask you something, okay?

1387
01:39:51,026 --> 01:39:51,985
Mm-hm.

1388
01:39:54,154 --> 01:39:56,115
Why are you always so mean to your mom?

1389
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:58,617
Eun-ja?

1390
01:40:01,453 --> 01:40:02,913
Why would you ask me that?

1391
01:40:04,456 --> 01:40:06,250
What if she stops supporting you?

1392
01:40:06,583 --> 01:40:07,501
Me?

1393
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:09,461
Never.

1394
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:11,714
Mm-mm.

1395
01:40:12,881 --> 01:40:13,924
That won't happen.

1396
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,009
Because...

1397
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:19,763
I'm all that she has in this world.

1398
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,060
Anyway,

1399
01:40:26,562 --> 01:40:28,063
are you two seeing each other?

1400
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:30,274
You're not, right?

1401
01:40:35,863 --> 01:40:36,905
Who's there?

1402
01:40:37,406 --> 01:40:38,741
There she is.

1403
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:40,200
Hyeon-u, is that you?

1404
01:40:40,951 --> 01:40:41,952
Hyeon-u.

1405
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:43,996
What's happened?

1406
01:41:01,305 --> 01:41:02,890
I came by 'cause I was hungry.

1407
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:04,558
I'm glad you did.

1408
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:07,144
Eat up.

1409
01:41:15,986 --> 01:41:17,196
Thank you, Eun-ja.

1410
01:41:32,795 --> 01:41:34,087
It's so good.

1411
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:39,945
What the...

1412
01:42:45,450 --> 01:42:46,660
- Hey...
- How's it going?

1413
01:42:47,369 --> 01:42:48,495
Uh, good.

1414
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:50,205
What's up?

1415
01:42:51,290 --> 01:42:53,000
I left something in the office.

1416
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:54,501
Do you mind if I go and get it?

1417
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:56,879
Uh, well, I'm busy now.

1418
01:42:56,962 --> 01:42:58,922
Tell me what it is.
I'll give it to you when I can.

1419
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:01,341
Uh, well...

1420
01:43:03,427 --> 01:43:06,096
It's the photo. The one on Mi-su.

1421
01:43:07,055 --> 01:43:08,557
Huh.

1422
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,641
That photo.

1423
01:43:10,601 --> 01:43:12,561
- It's at my place.
- What?

1424
01:43:12,978 --> 01:43:14,563
I'm really sorry. I just thought...

1425
01:43:15,314 --> 01:43:16,481
I thought you threw it out.

1426
01:43:25,324 --> 01:43:26,366
You're a piece of shit.

1427
01:43:31,872 --> 01:43:33,248
I think you're a good guy.

1428
01:43:34,917 --> 01:43:36,668
But you're too serious and gloomy,

1429
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:38,545
and so is Mi-su.

1430
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:41,381
I think she needs someone

1431
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,384
who can bring some happiness
back into her life.

1432
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:49,681
We all need to have some fun.

1433
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:16,959
Are you going to see Mi-su?

1434
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:18,502
Huh?

1435
01:44:19,169 --> 01:44:21,254
If I follow your car,
will you take me to her?

1436
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:25,300
You're gonna follow me?

1437
01:44:29,012 --> 01:44:30,806
Good luck with that, kid.

Should I pull over?

1457
01:46:38,058 --> 01:46:39,017
Uh...

1458
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:43,271
Yeah.

1459
01:47:17,139 --> 01:47:18,473
I love you, Mi-su.

1460
01:47:20,225 --> 01:47:21,143
I love you.

1461
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:55,135
Don't run after us.

1462
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,638
Please don't, okay, hm?

1463
01:48:00,682 --> 01:48:01,975
You'll get hurt.

1464
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:29,980
Why do you wanna have soju
with doughnuts?

1465
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:31,064
No reason.

1466
01:49:31,147 --> 01:49:32,899
I just haven't had doughnuts
in a long time.

1467
01:49:34,317 --> 01:49:35,652
I hope they taste good.

1468
01:49:36,778 --> 01:49:38,029
I didn't have all the...

1469
01:49:38,697 --> 01:49:40,031
proper ingredients.

1470
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:43,868
Well, they look great. Thank you.

1471
01:49:43,952 --> 01:49:45,078
Eat up.

1472
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:54,004
Mm.

1473
01:50:03,888 --> 01:50:06,558
You see? Nothing like the old days.

1474
01:50:09,144 --> 01:50:10,312
Wow.

1475
01:50:11,730 --> 01:50:13,732
Everything in the world has changed

1476
01:50:14,274 --> 01:50:17,110
except for these doughnuts.

1477
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:20,238
Mmm.

1478
01:50:20,322 --> 01:50:21,531
- Same taste?
- Mm-hm.

1479
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:24,701
Hang on, let me just...

1480
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:26,536
You can't eat doughnuts without coffee.

1481
01:50:26,619 --> 01:50:27,662
I'll go make some.

1482
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:40,717
What's wrong?

1483
01:50:42,552 --> 01:50:43,511
Nothing.

1484
01:50:45,388 --> 01:50:47,223
I was just thinking about the old days.

1485
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:50,310
You know, when...

1486
01:50:51,061 --> 01:50:53,396
Hyeon-u,
the guy who loved tofu was around.

1487
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:05,033
Yeah.

1488
01:51:10,622 --> 01:51:12,749
Hyeon-u promised me he'd be back...

1489
01:51:13,875 --> 01:51:15,168
and open a bakery for me.

1490
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:19,089
When?

1491
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:20,548
The other day.

1492
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,801
It looked like he had been
punched in the face.

1493
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:30,100
He just had some food and left.

1494
01:51:39,192 --> 01:51:41,528
Apparently,
I had told him that I trusted him.

1495
01:51:42,862 --> 01:51:45,740
He said I told him that years ago.

1496
01:51:46,574 --> 01:51:47,867
I don't even remember.

1497
01:51:52,497 --> 01:51:55,166
His grandmother, his aunt, his teacher.

1498
01:51:55,250 --> 01:51:56,292
No one believed him.

1499
01:51:57,752 --> 01:51:59,629
But I said that to him back then.

1500
01:52:00,922 --> 01:52:02,966
I have no memory of saying that.

1501
01:52:04,467 --> 01:52:07,095
But he still remembered
after all these years.

1502
01:52:48,303 --> 01:52:50,054
- What did he say?
- We're keeping this.

1503
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:52,515
Keep this.
But he said this part, instead of here.

1504
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:53,516
- Sorry.
- Yeah.

1505
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:55,185
Remember the ones
about hiking in England?

1506
01:52:55,268 --> 01:52:56,686
Oh, yeah, okay. Right.

1507
01:52:56,978 --> 01:52:58,271
I made a change here.

1508
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:01,399
- Uh, Hyeon-u.
- Yeah.

1509
01:53:01,483 --> 01:53:03,818
- You can go in now and set up.
- Okay, thanks.

1510
01:53:03,902 --> 01:53:05,069
It's a twin story.

1511
01:53:05,403 --> 01:53:06,863
- Mm-hm. Hey.
- Sounds good.

1512
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:08,031
Hey.

1513
01:53:08,114 --> 01:53:09,491
Twins. Okay.

1514
01:53:12,327 --> 01:53:13,870
Come in.

1515
01:53:14,996 --> 01:53:16,039
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

1516
01:53:16,122 --> 01:53:17,916
Oh, that must be the camera
for the livestream.

1517
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:21,794
But why exactly we have to offer
video footage of a radio show?

1518
01:53:22,045 --> 01:53:24,631
Uh, well, the camera
will take a bunch of screenshots,

1519
01:53:24,714 --> 01:53:26,799
then we'll put them together
to look like a video.

1520
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:28,092
- One image after another...
- Mm-hm.

1521
01:53:28,176 --> 01:53:30,136
So it'll look different
than what you're used to.

1522
01:53:30,929 --> 01:53:31,971
Hm.

1523
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,225
Well, today is the first day
of our video stream.

1524
01:53:36,267 --> 01:53:39,521
Is there a name you'd like me to mention?

1525
01:53:41,105 --> 01:53:42,273
Uh...

1526
01:53:52,283 --> 01:53:53,910
Whose name comes to mind?

1527
01:53:54,536 --> 01:53:57,330
It could be someone you barely know,
someone you miss,

1528
01:53:58,122 --> 01:54:00,416
<i>or someone that you see every day</i>

1529
01:54:01,084 --> 01:54:03,086

01:54:05,463 --> 01:54:09,425

1534
01:54:19,769 --> 01:54:21,771
<i>The very records of our lives.</i>

1535
01:54:25,066 --> 01:54:29,153
When I feel the warm sunshine,
and see the beautiful greenery,

1536
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:32,574
<i>I can't help but think of the thousands
of cherished names</i>

1537
01:54:32,657 --> 01:54:34,033
<i>and memories in my heart.</i>

1538
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:36,077

01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,830
<i>And to all you lovers out there,
this song's for you.</i>

01:54:56,890 --> 01:54:59,183
