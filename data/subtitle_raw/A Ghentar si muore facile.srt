1
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,200
The plane went down in that area.
Poor Ghentar.

2
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,300
Sometimes I ask myself if we'll ever 
rid ourselfs of those b#s*t!rds.

3
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,900
They don't waste any time, here they come already.
The only thing that works here is the police.

4
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,400
Halt!  Stop that ship!

5
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,900
Your life in Ghentar is going to be hell.

6
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,600
Don't worry about me Pablo, I'm accustomed to danger.

7
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,000
Besides, the bottom of the sea is like my second home.

8
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,500
The fish here aren't dangerous,
it's General Lorme's men you should avoid.

9
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:17,700
If we've gone to all the trouble of getting you from
Marselles it's because we need you here.... alive naturally.

10
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,000
The inhabitants of Ghentar die easily,
but I'm not from these parts.

11
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,000
I won't give General Lorme's men that satisfaction.

12
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,000
That won't be easy,
General Lorme probably already knows who you are.

13
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,600
Inspector Sirdar, I've come to inspect your documents.

14
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,300
Pablo and the American are onboard.
- We must act carefully.

15
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,800
General Lorme doesn't want international incidents.
- I think they'll try something tonight.

16
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,100
Richard, do remember the password.
- Yes, of course.

17
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,900
I'm starting to enjoy all this spy business.

18
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,400
'American tea, with mint'.
- And served in a clean cup.

19
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,200
If something were to happen to me, remember to
contact Gotar's followers at Bar Claveles.

20
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,100
Gotar? .... Who's he?

21
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,100
He's our leader.  But beware, 
that's a hot name here in Ghentar.

22
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
Here they come.  It's time to separate.

23
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,600
What now?
- I'll take care of Pablo, you get the other one.

24
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,900
Take this, you may need it.

25
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,700
I really am sorry.

26
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,100
Where did he go?
- That way.

27
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,900
Your face is hard, even though you look like an idiot.

28
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,200
I'm over here.

29
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,700
You must find Botul, he'll guide you.
Look out!!

30
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,700
Wait, don't shoot.  The General want's him alive.

31
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,000
Stay on your right.

32
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,700
Ok inspector.  Steer right ... a little more.

33
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,100
Nothing yet inspector.

34
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,900
He can't be far, keep on looking.
- Yes sir.

35
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,800
Full speed, we'll find him if the fish haven't eaten him yet.

36
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,300
There he is.

37
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,000
Are you sure?
- I haven't drunk tonight.

38
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,900
I can't see him.
- Me neither.

39
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,000
He was just here now, I swear it.

40
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,500
This isn't the best way to make introductions,
but you're not very hospitable here in Ghentar.

41
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,000
Only with suspicious night drifters.

42
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,900
What if I told you that I fell off a boat.

43
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:06,600
Yeah, a police boat.  Inspector Sirdar just passed through here,
and then you climbed on board.

44
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,900
If that what you're worried about little man,
that can be explained very easy.

45
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,900
I'm only passing through here, and I'm no friend of Sirdar.

46
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,900
Why don't we talk about this boss.
- That's more like it.

47
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,000
This is the best lure I've ever had.  
And it seems to me that you're also a fisherman.

48
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,300
In effect.  It appears to me that the sea in Ghentar is very rich.

49
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:47,900
But I don't think that lure will be of much use to me.

50
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm looking for 'rare fish'.
- Good luck to you then, would you like a drink?

51
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,600
Why not?  'American tea, with mint'.

52
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,100
But American tea isn't served with mint.

53
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,800
Why not?  If the cup is very clean.

54
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,300
You're the man Pablo was bringing in.
Why didn't you say so before?

55
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,900
Tomorrow we'll take you to Claveles Bar.  Where's Pablo?

56
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm afraid Pablo won't be joining us.

57
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,800
Another victim for Lorme!

58
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Stupid imbeciles!
- It's not easy finding a plane wreck at that depth General Lorme.

59
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:54,600
The plane can't be too far, it had barely taken off from Ghentar.

60
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,700
How is it nobody knows exactly where it fell!?
- In the same spot where they're searching your exellence.

61
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,400
Still no results, idiots!

62
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,000
They've found a tyre at 30 mt, it's only a matter of time.

63
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:30,000
A tyre!  A tyre!  It's the strong box I need to get! 

64
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,100
It needs to go to a safe place.

65
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:38,700
Do you have any idea what this means?
I won't tolerate this any more, this is the last warning!

66
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,600
But your excellency...
- I won't accept any more failure!

67
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,300
If they don't recover the documents I'll have you all shot!

68
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,500
I've given you all the men you asked for..

69
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:56,860
and you let it slip through
your fingers all because of that, that...

70
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:59,400
Richard, Richard Jason

71
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,100
That Richard Jason son of the devil.
And where are those dumb-asses that were going to arrest him?

72
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,700
They're under punishment.

73
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,900
Tell your men this is only a warning. Understand?

74
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:27,100
Let them know that General Lorme doesn't joke.
- Even so, inspector Sirdar is still our best agent.

75
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:31,000
If that's true, I can just imagine what the others are like.

76
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,400
And tell Sirdar that next time I'll punish him if need be.

77
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,400
I want that man here now.  Do you understand Coronel!?

78
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,200
Yes Sir, we'll put up checkpoints in all the city.

79
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,600
If he tries to make contact with the rebels...

80
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,100
... we'll catch him.

81
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,400
Look!

82
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,900
If anything happens to us, go to Bar Claveles,
your American tea is getting cold.

83
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,200
A thousand pardons.

84
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,700
Hey you American!  This way.

85
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,000
Hey babe.
- Hey, what are you doing?

86
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,300
Can I get you anything special stranger?

87
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,900
We have all sorts of liquor.
- Yeah, i noticed.

88
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,800
But I must confess, babes like you also make me dizzy.

89
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,400
I'd rather some 'American tea with mint'.

90
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,900
But American tea isn't made with mint.
However, if you want it done that way.

91
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:57,900
The girl made a mistake, American tea can also be
made with mint.  And even tastes good sometimes.

92
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,600
As long as the cup is clean.

93
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,900
The tea is ready.
- Not now, we'll have it later...

94
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,900
... together.

95
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:04,500
Relax stranger.  Who sent you?

96
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,400
I was told that the tea here was good.
But this place seems more like a boxing gym.

97
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,300
Who gave you this address?
- Friends.

98
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,600
Who's friends?

99
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,800
That depends.

100
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,900
We'll make you talk.

101
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,900
Hold it!  What are you doing, he's a friend!

102
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,700
You must forgive them my friend.
Ghentar is full of spies.

103
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,700
This is our man.

104
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,600
Pablo's man?
- Exactly.

105
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,900
Please forgive us stranger.
But you need more than a simple ID card to make contact.

106
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,900
It was my job to introduce him,
but inspector Sirdar was on our trail.

107
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:13,100
It's now clear that Lorme knows you're here.
This will make your job much harder.

108
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:25,400
Good, now that I've passed the security check,
would you please be kind enough to tell me what my job will be.

109
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,600
Because so far all I've had is a bad introduction. 

110
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,700
Aren't you an ace frogman?  That's why you're here.

111
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:45,900
Do you have a habit of being obscure,
or do I need to talk to Gotar to get the full story?

112
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,400
Don't even mention that name, 
nobody can see our leader.  I'll be giving you the orders.

113
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,400
What is it?

114
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,300
This is the north-east.  Clearly the transmittor is in the sea.
- I'd swear it was here.

115
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,800
Were're sure it's out there, but it's hard to locate.
We need to test it out there.

116
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,500
How far is it?
- It's hard to say, we need another man.

117
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,500
Ok, let's go.

118
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,900
Massage recieved.  Keep contact.  Did you hear that Noemi?

119
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,100
Let them try again.  This must be the right spot.

120
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,100
Of course Noemi, when plane fell I was fishing right here.
It almost fell on me.

121
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,900
It's encrypted.  We may not be able to locate the transmittor.

122
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:27,000
It's been transmitting the last two days.  They're in the sea.
- You keep on searching.  - Call the boat.

123
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,900
Clearly Gotar's men are trying to beat us to it.
- Sr, there's no answer.

124
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,900
Nothing sir.  That plane must of desintergrated.
- Try again, search deeper.

125
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,800
Here HQ,  waiting for your orders.

126
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:59,300
Suspicious fishing boat at Punta Blanca.  Check it out.
- Then it must be that one over there.

127
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,700
A wing!  That means we must be...

128
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:26,500
Yes, It's possible that the current hasn't pulled the wreck
down too far.  The bottom of the sea there is 200 mt.

129
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,600
Don't worry, the American is expensive, but he's worth it.

130
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,200
We can't trust him.  If he sees those documents.
- He's up to his neck now.

131
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,100
And he's knows he can't play games with us.

132
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,900
Let's get away.  Shut down the radio.

133
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,300
We only poor fishermen.
- So there's no rebels onboard.

134
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,900
Search the boat!

135
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
There must a man down there.  Finnish him off!

136
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,300
It's only rotten fish.
- It's actually quite fresh.

137
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,700
Why don't you take some.
- Let's go!

138
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,900
So you didn't find anything.
- Just a nasty cold.

139
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,800
It looks like we've got campany.
It's better if we cut the ropes.

140
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,400
Hey Botul, don't people die of old age in this country?

141
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:47,300
That's not easy.  These guys shoot first and ask later.
I just want to save my boat.

142
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,200
I love her like my sweetheart.

143
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:54,400
I agree, we should treat her as she were a woman.

144
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,500
How odd, they're giving us a warning.

145
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:05,700
Listen, what would happen if they arrested us?

146
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Nothing too bad.  Worst case, they'd just shoot us.

147
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,200
And the boat?
- It would be confiscated and taken to the fort's dock.

148
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:20,300
That's terrible.  You love this boat.  We must save her.

149
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,900
You escape with the boat.  I'll try and stall them.
We'll meet again soon.

150
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Don't let him get away.  We'll follow the boat.

151
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,400
There's no point trying to escape.  Give youself up, it's better.

152
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,100
Welcome Mr Jason.

153
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,700
General Lorme is anxious to meet you.  We've been
expecting you for some time. Would you be kind enough.

154
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:41,900
It would be rude to make him wait now, don't you agree?

155
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,700
Fear not my dear, sooner or later I'll come and save you.

156
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
Have you recovered your memory Mr Jason?

157
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:28,800
Or perhaps we need to try a little harder?
- Continue.

158
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,500
I've already told you, I've lost my ID papers onboard.
I've been robbed.

159
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:45,800
We know that story, tell us something we don't know.
For eg. what were you doing on that boat?

160
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:51,200
I just hired any boat.  I'm an underwater fisherman.

161
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:55,200
You didn't run into two police frogmen by any chance?

162
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,100
No, why?
Were they supposed to ask me for my fishing licence?

163
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,100
Unfortunatley they're now dead.

164
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,500
And under very strange circumstances.  Isn't that odd?

165
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:21,300
If would be better if you talk now Mr Jason.
We know the rebels hired you to find a plane.

166
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:29,000
As a professional frogman your ears are of great value
to you.  How much are they worth to you?

167
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,500
My ears are good, but I can't say the same about yours...

168
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:39,300
since you haven't understood a word of what I've said.

169
00:34:53,300 --> 00:35:00,900
Our divers found the plane cabin empty,
someone must of beaten us to it.

170
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,200
Well Mr Jason?

171
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,700
A plane at the bottom of the sea?  
What's that suppose to be... a riddle?

172
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:15,300
It's possible he's telling the truth General.
The explosion may have thown the box anywhere..

173
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:23,700
although not very far, and a man like this can be of
help to us... as long as he's willing to reason.

174
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,100
You're a great psychologist captain.
Very well, I'm willing to be reasonable.

175
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,100
Very good Kim.  This time you've hit the mark.

176
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:40,900
And good for you too Mr Jason.  Now you're starting to be
reasonable.  We'll pay you well, more than the rebels did.

177
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:47,200
I'm moved when I hear you speak of money,
but unfortunatley I can't accept.  - Why?

178
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,500
I like living in this disgusting world,
but if I work for you, the others will want to kill me too.

179
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,100
I don't want to contradict you General,
but I don't think you're very popular here in Ghentar.

180
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,100
You'll be under our protection.
- And who protects you?

181
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:09,500
I've heard the people speak of revolution.
I've read Gotar's declarations.

182
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:17,400
Shut up!  You westeners beleive anything.
Gotar is only a name, and nothing more!

183
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,200
It's only a cheap trick to gain power.

184
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,200
You don't like to be contradicted, right?

185
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,200
I suggest sending him to The Mines Of Paradise.
A few days there will do him well.

186
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:38,800
Not a bad idea Captain.
You deserve a promotion.

187
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,700
There's nothing like 'Paradise'.

188
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,900
Where's the American?
- He's doing his duty Captain.

189
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,900
I want you to give him special treatment.
- I'll take care of it personally

190
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Back to your post, you hear!

191
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:17,390
Can't you see I'm trying to help this poor man.
- Don't argue you imbecile!

192
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,200
POW!

193
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:22,300
You're too nervous, let me calm you down.

194
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,200
ARRGH!

195
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,200
SMACK!!

196
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,999
Back to work!

197
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,900
So, has our American calmed down?
- Can't even hear him.  He must be 'well done'.

198
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,200
Well now...

199
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,900
Have you finally decided to work for us?

200
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:40,300
Your hands are best suited for swimming,
not for breaking stones.

201
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,100
I must confess that our divers found nothing.

202
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,600
Or can we assume... that you've beaten us to it.

203
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,800
I thought we had nothing left to talk about Captain.

204
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,900
That's a real shame.  I was hoping to take you with me.

205
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:13,800
Whoever called this place The Mines Of Paradise
had a strange sense of humor.  Even hell is cooler than this.

206
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,400
Leave him!

207
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,900
Let me make a confession.

208
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:41,100
It's about time you talked.

209
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:46,100
You have the worst beer here in Ghentar.

210
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,400
You damn traitor.  Take him away!

211
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,900
We'll see in a few days if you still feel like joking.

212
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,900
All our state treasure is in enemy hands...
Do you know what this means!?

213
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:17,000
Begging your pardon, but it's likely the diamonds are still in
the sea. When we arrested the American the boat was empty.

214
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,200
Did you hear that Coronel?
And I'm suppose to be paying you to think of that.

215
00:42:21,499 --> 00:42:27,200
Move it!  Get me the American,
we have to make him talk whatever the cost!

216
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,400
So they've finally let you out of that 'cooking pot'.

217
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,200
I was lucky,
they just didn't have as much patience as I did.

218
00:42:55,499 --> 00:43:01,600
Listen, you've proven to us that you're a brave man.
We believe you can be trusted.

219
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:03,900
Let me make you an offer.

220
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:08,800
We're planning a break out.

221
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,200
Do you want to be in on it?

222
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:17,900
Why not, I wasn't planning on growing roots in here.

223
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:24,100
Good, that makes four of us.  
But we need more to improve our chances.

224
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:30,000
We must act fast.  I'm an impatient character.

225
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,200
There's a fabulous treasure waiting for me in Ghentar.

226
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,500
A women eh?
- Huh, yes.

227
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,900
If I don't hurry I may never see her again.
You know what women are like.

228
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,500
Now listen carefully guys.

229
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,500
I have an escape plan, it can't fail.

230
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,900
It's all up to us now.
We'll be out of here in no time.

231
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,700
Do you all agree?

232
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,000
Then listen carefully.

233
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:21,200
So the American wants to break out?
- I overheard the whole thing Captain.

234
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:26,000
We should of let him cook in the pot longer.
- We need him alive, you know that.

235
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,900
Shall I put him under survailance?
That guy's capable of anything.

236
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,900
No, let him be.  Let's pretend we know nothing.

237
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,300
Leave him alone?
- Of course.

238
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,200
First of all, nobody has ever escaped from here anyway.

239
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,800
Besides, I've just received special orders...

240
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,900
From General Lorme.  Very interesting orders indeed.

241
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,900
Corporal, I'm going to find a pick.

242
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,900
I've got the dinamite, get ready.
- Yes.

243
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,700
You!  Where are you going?
- To the carriages  - Ok, pass.

244
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:37,800
To the truck!  Let's go, quick!

245
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,300
Rat-tat-tat-tat

246
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,200
Rat-tat-tat-tat

247
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,400
Son of the devil!  Cowards!

248
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,900
Rat-tat-tat-tat ... Rat-tat-tat-tat

249
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:35,699
Hahahahah!

250
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,500
Hahahahah!
B-O-O-M!!

251
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:42,600
That bird won't fly no more!
- If only that pig Lorme were in it. 

252
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:48,600
Now we must face the desert.
We have to leave the main road.

253
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:52,800
But without food and supplies we can't get very far.

254
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,900
If we're going to die, let it be far from this place.

255
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:07,700
Wait, maybe those two dead men
have something that we can use.

256
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:12,600
Stop it!  This is no time to start fighting.

257
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:55,400
With this sun we'll never make it, it's madness.

258
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,000
But if we keep on going,
we could be at the sea by tommorow.

259
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,700
Are you crazy?  Even if we stayed on track,
it would take at least three days.

260
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,800
We can't walk in the day.

261
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,800
We'll travel by night.

262
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:13,400
During the day we'll stay in the shade.

263
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,100
But we don't even have water for two days.

264
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:21,800
Then we'll have to lower our rations.
- We have no choice, our chances of survival are bad.

265
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,900
Let's go!

266
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,700
Finally, you're awake.

267
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:45,800
I'm just curious, is this the final judgement
or are we in the pre-chamber?

268
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,500
What's your name darling?

269
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,999
Well, well Mr Jason.

270
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:09,300
I see they've been taking good care of you.

271
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:14,400
You got that right captain.  The service here is
much better than in The Mines Of Paradise.

272
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:16,200
You, leave us.

273
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,600
What a shame...

274
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:25,700
Now that I've found the real paradise...
You'll send me straight back to hell.

275
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:30,700
It's evidently clear that the 'Mines' treatment
hasn't worked on you.

276
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,100
The trip here by helicopter was very long.

277
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:39,500
I can assure you Captain that my trip here
was much less comfortable than yours.

278
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,100
Why do you take so many risks?

279
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:56,700
You're a shrewd man...
And shrewd people never take risks without a motive.

280
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:01,200
Well, you see captain,
I've got my professional dignity.

281
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:07,200
Gotar pays me and I can't switch sides...
even if you threaten me.

282
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,400
 Now you're being unreasonable.
- You should be tourist guide.

283
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,000
And organise lovely excursions to The Mines Of Paradise.

284
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:19,100
You disappoint me Mr Jason.

285
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,900
So much idealism... when it's diamonds you're after.

286
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,700
Diamonds?  What are you talking about?
I thought it was only some documents.

287
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:32,300
And naturally you'd only give these
documents the rebel leader.

288
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:35,800
Yes, exactly, only to Gotar.

289
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:39,300
But just like a fish, I prefer the sea to the desert.

290
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:45,400
Have you ever met Gotar?
- No, he doesn't like publicity.. That is, if he really exists.

291
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,900
Would you like a cup of tea Mr Jason?
- Yes.

292
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:01,900
With some mint leaves.

293
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,200
American tea isn't served with mint...
even if the cup is clean.

294
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:18,600
So you must be Gotar... I mean, the real Gotar.

295
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:27,700
I would never of guessed it.
And neither would General Lorme I suppose.

296
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,800
Good, now we can show all our cards.

297
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,600
Where are the diamonds?
Lorme's men found an empty box.

298
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,600
Give me a break Captain,
don't you people in Ghentar believe anying?

299
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:47,400
I didn't find anything, just a plane wreck.

300
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:56,600
That plane was shot down under my orders to prevent Lorme
from sending them away.  It's the treasure of my people!

301
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:02,400
I understand, however this is the first
time I hear anything about diamonds.

302
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:07,700
For the last time Jason, where are those diamonds?
- And me?....

303
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:11,000
Where am I?
- Captain, it's the radio.

304
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,200
Take him inside.
- Follow me.  -I'm coming.

305
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:22,600
We hear you, this is free Ghentar radio.
It's the boat command.

306
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:26,800
Gotar here, speak Noemi.

307
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,200
Understood, I'll be there right away.
- What is it?

308
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:41,200
We've been discoverd by Lorme's police,

309
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:45,900
And our attempted assault has failed.

310
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,300
You're coming with me Mr Jason.
You're worth too much to us.

311
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,700
You prepare the jeep, and give him a uniform.

312
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,200
Traitors!  So you wanted to take over the fort.

313
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:08,300
A brilliant plan.  But you should've know better.

314
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:15,100
Democracy, freedom.. after all they're just words.

315
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:20,300
Do you know what I do with traitors?
I shoot them all!

316
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,700
I don't need a blindfold.

317
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:45,300
You're going to meet Gotar in hell,
with or without the blindfold.  Make it quick!

318
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:10,900
Be carefull Mr Jason.
General Lorme would very glad to get his hands on  you.

319
01:08:11,300 --> 01:08:15,200
Don't worry about me Captain,
I never fall from the frying pan into the fire.

320
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,600
Sargeant, come here!

321
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,800
General Lorme has orderd a blockade,
we have a curfew.

322
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:27,300
A curfew?

323
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:36,500
Thanks sargeant.  Get back to your post.

324
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:58,800
You blend in well with that uniform.
- Yes, and so do you.

325
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,300
Botul!  What you doing here?
- Quick, let's go.

326
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:20,900
How's it going American?  - Botul, you old fox.
I'm so glad to see you.

327
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:25,600
Hey, watch your mouth.  
I'm not allowed to fraternize with prisoners.

328
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:38,900
Tell me Botul, do all your revolutions go so well?

329
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:46,500
You better pray this one does.  If things get ugly,
you'll go straight back into Lorme's hands.

330
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:49,300
He's not kidding.
- Everything will be ok.

331
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:56,500
And you shouldn't worry about it. 
Very soon you'll be reunited with your dear boat.

332
01:09:56,500 --> 01:10:01,700
I doubt it.  Lorme's men have confiscated it.

333
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,200
Confiscated?  What for?

334
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:12,300
Who knows.  Right now it's rotting away
in the fort's dock.  My poor little boat.

335
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:20,800
In the fort?  -Yes that darn fort, with all those
canons.  I would need to be a fish to see my boat.

336
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:25,900
A fish?  What do you mean by that?
- Well, you see...

337
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:31,700
Only a fish could get in though the
underwater rocks without being seen.

338
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:38,000
Now you've just found yourself an American fish.

339
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:45,200
I give you my word Botul... 
you'll see that boat again.  - Really?

340
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:53,300
I've just had a brilliant idea.
And I'm sure Ghentar's new leader will aprove.

341
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,900
Come on.  Row.

342
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:10,200
Welcome aboard my dear Mr Gotar.

343
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:17,200
We're very glad to see you.
Would you be so kind as to raise your hands.

344
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,600
You weren't expecting us, right?

345
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,800
Boys, we've made a good catch.

346
01:11:26,100 --> 01:11:29,700
General Lorme has chosen a special death for you.

347
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:37,400
After your death, Gotar will only be a name,
forgotten and lost, Captain King...

348
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:40,300
Or should I call you Gotar, if you prefer?

349
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,900
She's very lucky...

350
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:54,200
The General likes beautiful women.
Take her away!

351
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,200
Lock them up!
- B#s*t!rds!

352
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,400
Burn everything!

353
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,100
B#s*t!rds.

354
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:34,100
So much for the revolution.
I never thought it would all go up in smoke.

355
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:39,400
Don't worry, we won't be cooked alive.
See all this dynamite here..

356
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:43,400
When the fire gets here, Boom!
That'll be the end of us.

357
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:49,700
Dynamite, eh.  Heaven doesn't want us just yet.

358
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:04,100
Hey Botul, where's that dynamite?
- Inside that box.

359
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,900
Make it quick, the fire is almost here!

360
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:21,600
Hey Botul, do you have any matches?

361
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:26,700
What for!?  This whole place is on fire.
Ok, just a second.

362
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:37,300
Hurry up!  Get back!
If you know any prayers, now's the time to say them.

363
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:43,300
Allah is great and merciful, please remember your servant..
- Get yourself in here!

364
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:47,200
B-O-O-M-!!

365
01:13:53,700 --> 01:13:56,800
Look, your Gotar has gone down into history.

366
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,200
I had no other choice.

367
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,700
How unfortunate that the American
will be the one who gives Ghentar her freedom.

368
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:51,300
The American is a devil in the water.
He's the only one who can pull it off.

369
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:58,900
Yes.  Besides, I couldn't send my people to
the slaughter house under the fire of those canons.

370
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,500
But I don't feel good risking his life.

371
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:10,300
He offerd himself willingly by saying:
"You paid me to open a box, but now I'll open you a fort".

372
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:17,500
The men must be ready to attack once they hear the explosion.
Now get ready!

373
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,400
I hope luck is on Jason's side, he's our only hope.

374
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:01,200
Halt!

375
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:13,200
Don't you reconize me soldier?
- Give the password!

376
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:17,099
Here goes..

377
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,100
POW!!
Here goes..

378
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:21,800
A man came from over there, then hit me by suprise.
He went that way. - Sound the alarm, let's go!! 

379
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:58,400
Mr Jason, you seem to have more lives than a cat.

380
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:04,600
I hope they last me untill I retire.
- General Lorme will decide that.

381
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:13,400
I believe in divine fate.
Anyway, we'll all be paying him a visit any moment now.

382
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,000
SMACK!!

383
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:29,800
AAAARRRH!!!

384
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,800
$$$$

385
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:53,800


386
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,800
K-A  B-O-O-M-!!!

387
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,000
He's done it!  Give the signal to attack!

388
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:52,800
Inspector Sirdar!  I sure am glad to see you.

389
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:11,800
Where have you been?
- Trying get out of this hell.

390
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:16,400
I agree.  I've come to save my poor little boat too.

391
01:29:16,600 --> 01:29:21,900
That's great!  Boats like this are hard to find.

392
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,800
Were are you going American!?

393
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,000
Give me a hand.

394
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:51,600
This is no time for games.

395
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,300
Back off!

396
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:24,100
Back off or I'll shoot her.

397
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:54,000
Give me the rudder.
- Ok.

398
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:03,300
American, where are you going?  
The city is that way.

399
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:10,700
Our future is that way.  I bet you didn't
know that your boat was also a strong box?

400
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:17,500
A strong box?  Listen American, are you speaking in riddles?

401
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:41,400
It's the treasure of Ghentar!
- Let's say that it was, now it belongs to us.

402
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:48,100
No, we can't do this!  Think of our country,
of our new found freedom..

403
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:55,400
And you just think of a hotel next to the beach,
surrounded by charming blond babes.

404
01:31:55,500 --> 01:32:00,600
Don't be a fool my friend.
These stones never belonged to the people.

405
01:32:00,650 --> 01:32:05,500
They were in Lorme's pocket,
and they would of ended up in Gotar's pocket too.

406
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:13,100
You're right!  We can't permit these stones
to fall into the hands of the oppressors.

407
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:18,700
I am, a sincere democrat..
and with diamonds, even more so!

408
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,700
You sons of a crazy cow!!

409
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:49,500
There's nothing we can do.  It's at least 150 mt deep.

410
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:59,100
What a shame, for a moment I thought I was a rich man.
- And we were, how disgusting!.

411
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:07,100
After all the effort I've done, I'll only be a poor old man.

412
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:10,400
Do you have a cigarette?

413
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:36,200
This should be enough to pay for our travel expenses.
- Where are we going?

414
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:42,600
To find another country in need of a revolution.

415
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:51,800
hahahahah!!    (crazy laughter)

416
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:12,600
The American is leaving with Botul.

417
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:18,990
We've lost all the diamonds,
but we've gained our freedom.

418
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:49,800
