13
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,760
Hey, old man! Careful!
Watch where you're walking!

14
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,930
Come in, since you're here.
There's no need for ceremony.

15
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,040
Hello!
Thank you for welcoming me.

16
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,990
- Greetings!
- Hello!

17
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,390
My name is Haru Danku.
I don't mean to disturb you, but...

18
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,310
since you always help me a lot...

19
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,680
Let me introduce you.

20
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,280
This is my elder son, Saijiro,
and the younger one is Taro.

21
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,380
Really?
Taro is your son too?

22
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,100
We're not similar, right?

23
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,470
That's not what I meant...

24
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,940
That's because we have
different mothers.

25
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,130
Father, are you really spending
money on him?

26
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:10,300
I'm putting this money
to good use.

27
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,140
It's been 49 days since your
wife has passed away.

28
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,720
Don't think I'm immodest, but allow me
to burn incense in her honor too.

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,520
That's why I like him.

30
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,230
He's always so polite and
well-mannered.

31
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,720
Unlike most people in Osaka.

32
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,500
Come on, brother, it's time.

33
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,580
Come on, don't hurry up.
Let's honor mother first.

34
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,179
Bow a couple more times and that's it.
She's not your real mother, anyway.

35
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,440
All father's wives are our mothers.

36
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,920
These are just meaningless
ceremonies.

37
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:48,440
Father can manage on his own here.
It's better to get back to work.

38
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,610
So, the deceased was
Taro's mother?

39
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,860
- No, no.
- Huh?

40
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,880
You have time to spare, though.

41
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,020
I have more free time than
you, brother.

42
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,030
I can see that.

43
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,610
Get back to the office and tell
everyone I'll be there soon too.

44
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,800
Yes, I'll do that.

45
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,950
Goodbye, dad.

46
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,120
Thanks for your visit.

47
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,760
Give my regards to your wife.
Tell her to honor your mother too.

48
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,210
We'll see.
She's too far into pregnancy now.

49
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,490
How is brother going to manage
with a child on top of everything?

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,790
His salary is barely enough.

51
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,220
But it can't be helped.
I guess family planning isn't in our genes.

52
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,770
And where's Otogi?
She's always up to something.

53
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Otogi!

54
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,170
Otogi!

55
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,850
We have a guest.
Is there any food left for him?

56
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,580
I didn't know we would have guests.
I ask you to forgive me.

57
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,960
I was working in the backyard.

58
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,680
Is there any sake left, at least?

59
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:57,520
I'll bring it right away.

60
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,000
Maybe I shouldn't say this in front of the
deceased, but you're a real ladies' man.

61
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:13,320
Including this lady just now,
how many wives did you have?

62
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,010
This one is just a maid, though.

63
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you have a maid?

64
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,720
We're a fourth-generation tabi
salesmen family, after all.

65
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,769
So, your ancestors were merchants?
That explains everything.

66
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,000
I represent the fifth generation.

67
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,090
Merchants are a thing
of the past.

68
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,460
And I'm fed up with women.

69
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,170
What a drag.

70
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,760
Every 1st and 15th day of the month,
you have to put new clothes on me.

71
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,610
And for that, three seamstresses
have to work all year round.

72
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,820
This is your family's tradition.

73
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,340
And no business is complete
without them.

74
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,660
Both madams are here.

75
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,640
You're dismissed.

76
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,799
You wanted to see me?

77
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,140
Kikuji, you've gone too far. Don't you
think you should stop fooling around?

78
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,220
And you're not even the head of the family yet. It
would be one thing if it stayed within the family.

79
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,659
But even people at the store
know about it now.

80
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:03,040
Either you stop fooling around with all those
girls or you find a wife. The choice is yours.

81
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
Kikuji!
I urge you to take this seriously.

82
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,140
I'm listening to you.

83
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,150
We want to hear what
you have to say.

84
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,690
Whatever I say, the outcome
is always the same.

85
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,180
So, you refuse to listen
to your grandma?

86
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,940
Don't be so impatient, mum.

87
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,560
If you explain it to him gradually,
he will understand everything.

88
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:35,900
He's very spoiled.
He only does as he pleases.

89
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:42,210
I don't remember raising you,
my only daughter, like that.

90
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,810
I'm sorry, mum.

91
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:49,510
Come on, Kikuji, please
apologize to grandma.

92
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,970
I'd rather watch you keep playing this game
of mother-in-law and daughter-in-law.

93
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,110
Kikuji!

94
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:03,610
I'm sure it was Kihei
who taught him to talk like that.

95
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,030
Call Kihei!

96
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,270
Mum, my husband is a
well-mannered man.

97
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,740
How dare you?
Don't you dare tell me anything about him.

98
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,980
Maybe marriage is not
such a bad idea.

99
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,600
If you get married, you'll inherit the house
of Kawachi and become the head of the family.

100
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,050
It's still not too late to
start a family.

101
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,220
I'm only 22 years old.

102
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:39,160
Exactly. Stop messing around
and find yourself a wife.

103
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,690
Or, even better,
let us find you a wife.

104
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,780
- There must be no mistakes.
- Yes!

105
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,709
Two hundred fifty two...

106
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm calling about a mistake
in the contract.

107
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,220
Unfortunately, we have to put
the processing order on hold.

108
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,510
Yes, this is the last shift.

109
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,790
Good.
We won't disturb you again.

110
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:11,390
Thank you and goodbye.

111
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,520
Is anything wrong, master?

112
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:24,790
It's nothing.
Is Kikuji here?

113
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,040
Yes, he's just come.

114
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:33,870
I didn't see him.
He must have used the back door.

115
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,280
Good that he's here.

116
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,020
Our partner from the Takano family was able
to afford the purchase of a sugar factory.

117
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,380
We must uphold our reputation.

118
00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:00,390
Usually it's good to save money,
but sometimes it's worth the expense.

119
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,740
We have to show people
that our store...

120
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,000
is doing well and business
is booming.

121
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,200
That's true, mum. It's no longer
necessary to dress haphazardly.

122
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,190
I checked the wardrobe...

123
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:19,890
but I couldn't find your
favorite red kimono.

124
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,590
I was really surprised.

125
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,960
Thank you, Sei!

126
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,100
Look at yourselves.
You're ridiculous.

127
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,890
Mother, I didn't know you were here.
Sorry for not noticing.

128
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:58,710
Who cut the radishes so big?

129
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,570
It was me.

130
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,650
You have to chop them into
small cubes.

131
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,910
But the young mistress said it
was good enough like this.

132
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,520
So, you're the one who let
her cut those slices?

133
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,300
I said the same.

134
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,730
So, why didn't you fix it?

135
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,880
It takes too long to chop
them into small cubes.

136
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:28,060
The dish doesn't have to be flamboyant,
but it has to look good.

137
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,980
A handful of small cubes look better
than two or three large pieces.

138
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,810
It makes the dish look bigger.

139
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,370
Although these are small things,
they are the key to success.

140
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,200
Only stupid, rich people can
afford to cut like this.

141
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,240
Hiroko, in our family there are strict
rules even for food.

142
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:03,990
Even pickles need to be cut in a special way. If you
want to stay here, be sure to respect our traditions.

143
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,630
Otherwise, you're out.

144
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,270
Do you understand?

145
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,440
Young mistress!
Don't do that!

146
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,800
Not yet?

147
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,360
It seems like it.

148
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:38,350
That's so strange.
Why is it so late this month?

149
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,900
Excuse for my intrusion.

150
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,600
What are you looking for,
young and old mistress?

151
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:02,830
A wallet fell in earlier.
We were trying to find it.

152
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,440
I'll help you look for it,
if that's the case.

153
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,560
Then, look carefully.

154
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:32,270
I don't feel comfortable showing my
feelings in front of the shop staff.

155
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,880
What's wrong?
Are you lonely? Come on, tell me.

156
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,180
Such a beautiful neck,
so smooth...

157
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,120
What's wrong with you?

158
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,730
What happened?

159
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,330
Tell me!

160
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,780
Your grandma...

161
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,340
She... just now...

162
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,890
Can you speak more clearly?

163
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,100
She...

164
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:13,430
She was spying on me to see if
my period had started.

165
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,940
That's humiliating.

166
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,520
It's horrible.
Both for me and the child.

167
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,880
I'll end up losing it.

168
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,970
A child, you say?
Are you pregnant?

169
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,780
I think so.

170
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:39,280
What, it's a boy?
Send Hiroko my greetings.

171
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,200
Yes. Wait for me.

172
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,520
Father, it's a boy.

173
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,920
Is that so?
We'll finally have an heir!

174
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,630
Who is it?

175
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,090
It's me.

176
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,459
I just spoke to the Takano
family on the phone.

177
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,680
And then?

178
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,740
A baby is born.

179
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,150
Whose?

180
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Well... it's Hiroko and mine's.

181
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,540
Don't you just stand there.
Come inside.

182
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,260
Have a seat.

183
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,050
I have kidney problems.
Don't make me stand up.

184
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,950
Is that the reason you
came back last year?

185
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,940
We suspected there was something wrong
with her and we were worried.

186
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,650
Were you?

187
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,620
According to an ancient
family tradition...

188
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:28,870
we must make an offering
to the ancestors before a baby is born.

189
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,140
How can you act so recklessly?

190
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,230
I'm sorry, mum, I didn't explain it
to my daughter-in-law.

191
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:40,270
It's not just your fault.
It's mine too.

192
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:46,620
I can't face Hiroko now.
She should be taken in by her mother.

193
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:50,010
I wanted to suggest that too.

194
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,600
Will she go back to her family
to raise the child?

195
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,080
Not only for that.
She broke the rules of this house.

196
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,100
You wanted me to get married sooner.
And now you're dissatisfied, grandma.

197
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:05,470
Kikuji, you have to make up
your mind.

198
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,400
Tell me...
is the baby a girl or a boy?

199
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,360
It's a boy.

200
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,740
But it's women's day today.

201
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:21,600
She gave birth to spite us.
Right?

202
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:36,330
Thank you for coming even though it's
unbearably hot today. Please, take a fan.

203
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,170
The matchmaker's offer
was clear to us.

204
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,940
Otherwise, we wouldn't
have agreed.

205
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,160
But engagement with someone from a
salesmen family might hurt our reputation.

206
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,680
We'll take her.

207
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,780
Since you say so,
we also have something to say.

208
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,090
If we do this wrong,
we might lose credibility.

209
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,360
We are very much aware
of that too.

210
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,880
Hiroko asked to be taught about
our family traditions...

211
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:13,810
but none of the women here took a
responsible approach to her training.

212
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,140
What?

213
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,880
Has Hiroko already complained
to you?

214
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,290
What else...

215
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,970
Young master, it's enough now.

216
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:26,060
And don't interrupt anymore when
we're discussing family matters.

217
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,320
You'll have a word when you
become the head of the family.

218
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,550
As for now,
you're just creating problems...

219
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,660
and getting on our nerves.

220
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,250
Is that so?

221
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:44,290
What do you mean, "is that so"?
Why should our girl suffer?

222
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,230
Don't you think it's too much?

223
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,780
Everything will be inherited by the son,
but Hiroko does not receive any benefits.

224
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,220
Kikuji is only the young master and
he doesn't have to get married.

225
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:04,410
I understand. If you're honest, take a
list of her things and send them to us.

226
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,640
We'll take everything that
belongs to Hiroko.

227
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,960
Enough now.
Women are too emotional.

228
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,220
There's nothing more to discuss here.
We're taking Hiroko and that's it.

229
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,080
I'll call her right away.

230
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:49,480
I heard everything.
You don't have to say anything.

231
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:58,220
You didn't even let me
hug you last night.

232
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,990
We're strangers from now on.

233
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,940
Saijiro is still so little.

234
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:26,460
His wet-nurse seems to be a caring
woman, so I'm relieved.

235
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:28,600
Will you forgive me?

236
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,070
OSAKA NIPPO NEWSPAPER

237
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,430
KANSAI SHIMBUN NEWSPAPER

238
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,050
No need to shout!
Everyone, calm down!

239
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,050
Hey! Don't be violent!
Calm down!

240
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,500
It's so hot.

241
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,026
I'm so sweaty,
I can't even hold a needle.

242
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:20,090
Wipe your hands. If the clothes are wet,
we'll get in trouble again.

243
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,020
Hot springs are probably
colder right now.

244
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:30,060
Don't even dream about those. Only the
young and old mistress can bath in them.

245
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,440
And the young master is looking
after his father now.

246
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,370
That's why he's not here.

247
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:41,490
Kikuji, how much do I have?

248
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,700
How much what?

249
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,100
I'm talking about my property.

250
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,600
I want to know what
I've made in my entire life.

251
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,460
I never counted that.

252
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:59,460
And now that you're sick,
you decided to think about it?

253
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,920
I've been working in Kawachi
since I was 15.

254
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,100
When I was 26, I got married.

255
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,880
It's been 25 years.

256
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,340
My fortune could have doubled.

257
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,540
I can count everything tomorrow.

258
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:22,960
Some time ago, before this
whole bank thing...

259
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,000
I made a small deposit.

260
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,320
That's why Kawachi didn't
suffer any losses.

261
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,360
Grandma and mum are
going too far.

262
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,580
They've been ignoring Saijiro
for two weeks.

263
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,550
And they left you here alone.

264
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,120
I'm glad you care about him.

265
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:43,460
They treat Saijiro like a girl.

266
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,360
There's nothing we can do.

267
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,520
Say, father, aren't you and mum
husband and wife?

268
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
Didn't we give birth to you?

269
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,920
So, why is it like this?

270
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,050
When she lights up...

271
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:07,950
a lantern in the next room...

272
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,040
I can see its light from here.

273
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,080
Then, she opens the door...

274
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,500
and quietly gets under the
blanket next to me.

275
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,220
There's been nothing between
us for a long time.

276
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:29,490
Really?
So, that's how it is.

277
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:40,530
That doesn't matter.
I only care about my work, anyway.

278
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,140
According to the rules, women
are not allowed to interfere in business.

279
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:49,410
Did grandpa live with his
wife's family too?

280
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,790
I always thought he hated me...

281
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,330
because he saw in me...

282
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:03,390
his younger self.

283
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,450
It doesn't look like I'll be living
in my wife's house.

284
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,280
So, do what you enjoy, then.

285
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,890
Be a good son and develop
your spirit...

286
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,440
and abandon the worldly life.

287
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:24,650
Kikuji, I want something sweet.

288
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,210
I don't like what this
nurse cooks.

289
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,870
Is that so?
Let's find you a better one, then.

290
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,580
Evening!
Sorry to intrude.

291
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:52,560
Good evening!
Thank you so much.

292
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,940
Thank you, madam!

293
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,550
Good evening. Excuse my tardiness.
Thank you, madam!

294
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:15,140
But if it isn't the young boss
of the Kawachi family!

295
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,050
I see you have Fuku and Taiko here,
but don't forget about me either.

296
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:25,990
Which is Fuku and which is Taiko?
We haven't been introduced yet.

297
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,610
Looks like you've drunk enough.
Do you want more?

298
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,830
We're busy.
Thank you!

299
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,570
I'm so tired.

300
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,420
Would you like to leave?

301
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:45,390
- Then, we will accompany you together.
- Thank you.

302
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,940
All these geishas are so similar
to each other.

303
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,750
I couldn't tell the difference
between them.

304
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,960
You didn't spend a lot of
money today.

305
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,900
But you had your fun with women.

306
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,690
You should spend every night
like this.

307
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,110
You're a thrifty woman.

308
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:16,900
I'm also a caring one.

309
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:18,980
Can I ask you for a favor?

310
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,990
If eventually the health of the
master gets worse...

311
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,900
could you help one person
to take care of him?

312
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,320
You mean, my father?

313
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,370
She's been seeing the master
for 8 years.

314
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,700
Eight years?

315
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:36,750
Would you like to meet her?

316
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,090
Right now?

317
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,800
I'll go fetch her immediately.

318
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,460
Eight years?

319
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,890
Incredible.

320
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,600
Father never ceases to surprise me.

321
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,040
What I wouldn't give to see mum's
and grandma's faces right now.

322
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:16,640
My name is Kimiko.
The senior master took care of me.

323
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,950
It wouldn't be right if I didn't
take care of him now.

324
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:29,290
Father, I've found a great nurse for you.
Let me introduce her.

325
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,630
Kimiko?

326
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,370
Food for the patient will have to be
prepared by the nurse, as well.

327
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,390
Kikuji, this was unexpected!

328
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,150
Sir!

329
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,450
It's something to think about.

330
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,190
What's there to think about?

331
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:19,190
Unions are getting bigger.
But not here.

332
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,800
We should hire experienced workers...

333
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,810
and produce stuff for
the Kawachi family.

334
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,640
- It will allow us to increase salaries by 3 sen.
- By 3 sen?!

335
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,180
Well, maybe by 2 sen.

336
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,140
It's better to have something
than nothing.

337
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,690
Large factories are
closing everywhere.

338
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:45,830
If we increase salaries,
we'll go bust too.

339
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,270
That's true...

340
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,460
We're going to the bathroom.

341
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,520
Don't take long.

342
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,980
I've designed a new model
of tabi.

343
00:31:57,610 --> 00:31:59,810
No one has anything like it.

344
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,294
I'm sure they'll be popular.

345
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,710
Good idea.

346
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,670
These days, tabi are sold
for 10 per pair.

347
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,030
That's way too cheap.

348
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,630
They have no choice.

349
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,010
But it's cheap.
It's even lower than the cost price.

350
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,620
We have to take this niche and
sell the goods as quickly as possible.

351
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:21,490
Yosuke, find out more about it.

352
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,380
What are you doing?

353
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,480
Welcome back.
Thanks for taking care of Saijiro.

354
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,440
What do you mean, "welcome home"?
You don't have to pretend.

355
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:50,870
What are you talking about? While
we were working, you left to have fun.

356
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,330
Then, tell us, who's that woman?

357
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Which woman?

358
00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:00,420
We came in through the back door,
then went into the bathroom.

359
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,720
And, then, we saw some woman
in a robe sneaking into Kihei's room.

360
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,420
Oh, she's looking after father. The
doctor said he needed to be taken care of.

361
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:15,830
Something definitely smells fishy here.

362
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,520
You're overthinking.

363
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,020
I am not overthinking.
There have been rumors before.

364
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,040
But I didn't believe them, then.

365
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,110
You shouldn't take them
seriously.

366
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,940
Kikuji, if you have anything to
do with this...

367
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,840
how will your mother and I be able to
look people in the eye?

368
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:38,120
You have nothing to worry about.
This often happens to merchants.

369
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:43,410
Since my father is seriously ill,
he doesn't care about women at all.

370
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,850
She's just his nurse and
nothing more.

371
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,730
Kihei lives in his wife's house!

372
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,440
And who told you that father's nurse
is a woman like that?

373
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:54,190
Otogi, what do you
think about her?

374
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:03,140
You are the one who manages the
house in our absence.

375
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,700
You should know something.

376
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:11,590
I'm sorry, but I don't know
anything about her.

377
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,700
Mum! Please, stop!
Mum!

378
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,490
Quick!

379
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,830
Hurry up, the patient got worse!

380
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,020
The doctor sure is late.

381
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,070
I think unfortunately...

382
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,190
this is serious disease.

383
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,080
No one in the family...

384
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,800
has ever been so ill before.

385
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,700
I'm deeply sorry.

386
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,300
Father!

387
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,720
Sir... this is so sudden...

388
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,280
It figures, you did depend on that poor
excuse for a husband of yours.

389
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:46,800
Stop your crying.
It's so inappropriate.

390
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,130
HAMAYU RESTAURANT

391
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,330
We're glad to welcome you.

392
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:26,170
Kawachi trade house is happy to
present its new production line!

393
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,130
Oki-san, an umbrella!

394
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:31,020
- For me too, Ofuku!
- Yes.

395
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:36,180
Your gifts are a great indicator of
your hospitality.

396
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:42,420
But we have enough of our own tabis
at home, so keep these.

397
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,950
They're too expensive for me.

398
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,750
Really?
Too expensive, you say?

399
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:08,290
I apologize for the inconvenience.
I hope you didn't get wet.

400
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,270
The gift packaging might have
gotten wet and torn.

401
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,520
Please forgive me,
I overlooked that.

402
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,300
We're always looking forward
to your visit!

403
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:28,360
What a well-mannered woman.

404
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,100
I've heard her name is Ofuku.
She's the senior maid.

405
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:39,300
That's right. She's got both a
inward and outward beauty.

406
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,610
If I were a man, I would like to
have a child with someone like her.

407
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,360
But since you're a woman,
you'll keep harassing me.

408
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,560
Why are you so upset?

409
00:37:55,820 --> 00:38:00,350
I can't bring an ordinary woman
because of our family rules.

410
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,880
It's going to be a beautiful ceremony of passing
the house of Kawachi to the fifth generation.

411
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,420
And your mother and grandmother are
going to survive to witness it.

412
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,380
And it would be so nice if Ofuku
was there too.

413
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,930
Stop talking about her already.

414
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,200
Good evening.

415
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,640
Oh my, young master!

416
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,260
Thank you so much!
I'm so glad to see you again!

417
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,290
Again?
I've never seen you before.

418
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:52,900
How so? We met at the party in Hamayu
recently. Have you forgotten already?

419
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:54,770
Were you at that event, too?

420
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:58,860
I was, but I guess I shouldn't have
been so happy about it.

421
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,430
It was raining that day.
Do you remember, young master?

422
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,190
It was such a big and noisy event.

423
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,700
Don't say that, I'm no longer
a young master.

424
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,460
I'm the head of the family now.

425
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:17,350
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

426
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,780
Any ideas to have fun?

427
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:23,470
Hold on!

428
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,990
Look what I have.
And also this.

429
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,500
Do you like rings?

430
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,570
Yes, they are so beautiful.

431
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,140
You have a lot.

432
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,620
I put all of these on every time.

433
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:22,820
It would be better to wear one of them at a
time. It looks vulgar when they're all together.

434
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,020
But if a guest gives me a ring and I don't
wear it, he may be upset.

435
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,740
These five I got from a
sumo wrestler champion.

436
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,440
But do you, at least,
wear them in turn?

437
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,430
Yes, I started to when I
had too many.

438
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,340
Now I choose depending
on who I am meeting.

439
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,120
What's your name?

440
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:52,020
I'm Ponta.
Glad to make your acquaintance.

441
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:53,120
How old are you?

442
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:57,390
I tell everyone that I'm 20
but, in fact, I'm 18.

443
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,380
Why do you do that?

444
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,480
To be honest, when some clients
find out my real age...

445
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,460
they think I'm too young
and don't want to get involved.

446
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:12,070
Ponta, please wear only
one ring from now on.

447
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,000
Huh? Only one?

448
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,820
Thank you.
But I want a favor in return...

449
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:46,230
Sorry for the intrusion. It's so hot.
I'll come in for a minute.

450
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:31,100
I'm from the Koharu family
in Echigo.

451
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:35,200
Please, let the Madam know I'm here.

452
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,070
Go to the house and inform them.

453
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,090
Yes.

454
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,420
This is the first time we meet.
It's so hot outside.

455
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,120
Ah, welcome.
Have a seat please.

456
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,820
I'm Ponta from the Koharu family.

457
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,770
I wish prosperity to your family.
And thank you for your help.

458
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,260
I came here on purpose today...

459
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,220
to offer this gift as a sign
of my gratitude.

460
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:47,480
I'm good at keeping
trade secrets.

461
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,190
How is your health?

462
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:56,760
Thanks for worrying. Even when I have a cold,
I don't spend more than three days in bed.

463
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:02,070
That seems very good.
When did it start? At what age?

464
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:08,570
I mean, your period.
At 12 or 13?

465
00:44:09,330 --> 00:44:12,090
Well, at 12, I guess.

466
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:15,400
Really?
That was very early.

467
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:21,140
Our family already has a
seven year old heir.

468
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,680
So, you can't get pregnant.

469
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,950
I understand.

470
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:26,320
Where are you from?

471
00:44:27,270 --> 00:44:28,770
From Kobe.

472
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:30,300
Where are your parents?

473
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,000
My father died when I was little.
My mother raised me.

474
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,600
Your mother had to go through
the military turmoil?

475
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:40,690
That's right.
She was a second-generation geisha.

476
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:48,780
Really? Being a second-generation geisha,
she must have had a lot of popularity.

477
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:53,460
How much do you earn a month?

478
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:58,790
Thank you for your concern. I earn
enough, about a thousand yen a month.

479
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:04,940
What? I gave her 1200, so why did she
decide to keep silent about the rest?

480
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,080
This heat must have tired you out,
but it was nice to meet you.

481
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,970
Thank you for your warm welcome.

482
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,600
I was also pleased with
our acquaintance.

483
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,700
Why are you in such a hurry?

484
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,370
It's so hot.
I'm thirsty.

485
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:53,190
I wasn't even offered tea
in your house.

486
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,160
I told you, you shouldn't have come.

487
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:04,910
I'm sorry, but didn't you say
they might like me?

488
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,420
They said what was required
by those stupid family rules.

489
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:12,140
Everything else depends on their mood.
I thought you understood that.

490
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:17,250
If you want our relationship to be public,
you should be more concrete.

491
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:22,260
Then, you could send me my monthly
allowance openly. Decide who I am for you.

492
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,840
You're a geisha. Your position
in society isn't as high as mine.

493
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:40,270
Wow!
They offered me a piece of white silk?

494
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,630
Thank you!

495
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,680
Who are those people who are
greeting each other down there?

496
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,570
Those are girls from the Tomino family.
I know them.

497
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,520
The Tomino family?

498
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:14,840
She's their foster daughter. She has
difficult relationships with her mother.

499
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:18,910
Interesting.
I didn't know about it.

500
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:32,150
May your business prosper!
I'll be praying for you!

501
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:39,960
May the crisis end!
May it end!

502
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,610
Welcome!
You're early today.

503
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,860
I was passing by
and decided to come.

504
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,050
Why are you dressed like that?

505
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,110
The weather is good today.
I was putting the blankets out to dry.

506
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:48,850
The master has come. There's no need to
sweep the floor. Just clean up.

507
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:54,440
I don't know what she's doing
the whole day.

508
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,080
Oh no, I spilled a little.

509
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,220
Sit down.
Let's eat together.

510
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,680
You're running here and there.
Makes me feel like I already got married.

511
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,990
I'm sorry.
Before you get married...

512
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,190
you should build me a house.

513
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,750
So, you can keep visiting me.

514
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,240
Are you eating or not?

515
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:43,940
- I can't.
- Why not?

516
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,340
I don't feel comfortable sharing
such expensive dishes with you.

517
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:52,600
You shouldn't spend so much
money on me, master.

518
00:49:53,310 --> 00:49:55,960
I was raised to be a geisha.

519
00:49:56,470 --> 00:49:59,870
I'm not like Ponta, I was trained
into this profession.

520
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:01,900
You know about Ponta?

521
00:50:03,950 --> 00:50:04,950
Yes.

522
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:12,930
She seems to enjoy your attention.
You're young and wealthy, after all.

523
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,300
So, I'm lucky to have met you.

524
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,650
Stop flattering me, silly.

525
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,700
I'm serious.

526
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:24,610
Last year, you invited Kimiko...

527
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,340
to take care of your father.

528
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:32,450
You cleverly came up with everything
and paid her extra for it.

529
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,710
Now, with those savings, Kimiko
opened a store in Shikoku.

530
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:42,700
Enough! Enough! How come women
find out about everything?

531
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,940
I can't keep anything from you.

532
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,880
It got untied as if by magic.

533
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,870
It was tied like that on purpose.

534
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,540
Tie it again.
I want to see.

535
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,380
You don't need to know.

536
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,530
Where did you learn this?

537
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:27,220
I invented this method
myself to entertain you.

538
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:39,440
Kikuji!

539
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:41,060
Don't get your clothes wet.

540
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,690
What are you doing, grandma?
Are you nuts?

541
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:47,280
You're the one who's crazy!

542
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,020
Ponta is about to give birth.

543
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:59,790
The contractions started unexpectedly
and the midwife isn't at home.

544
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,520
- Their maid just called.
- What to do now?

545
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:05,200
I know you're my grandson,
but cover yourself.

546
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:12,430
I told her you're in the bathroom, but that
you'd figure this out. And, then, I hung up.

547
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,480
That poor girl...

548
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:16,000
How could you hide it from us?

549
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,580
If you're going to her, take money with you
and solve everything right away.

550
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:42,790
What do you mean?

551
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:48,580
If it's a boy, it will be 50 thousand,
if it's a girl, it's 10 thousand.

552
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:51,340
Then, you can break off
the relationship.

553
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,180
Money for the umbilical cord?

554
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,380
The umbilical cord is put in a paper bag
on which the parents' names are written.

555
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:02,070
If you don't do it now,
there might be problems later on.

556
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:09,040
When the baby grows up a bit,
it will be given to the foster parents.

557
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,299
And that's it?

558
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,730
Not yet, no.

559
00:53:11,850 --> 00:53:16,470
A child born out of wedlock
cannot get your ancestors' last name.

560
00:53:16,490 --> 00:53:20,800
Stop with that.
Don't you know she's just a concubine?

561
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,450
Acting like a man now?

562
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,520
You're starting to look down
on your mum and grandma.

563
00:53:29,430 --> 00:53:35,060
When your father was dying, he also thought that
the problem with that woman would just go away.

564
00:53:35,990 --> 00:53:39,220
In any case, I'll act according to the
rules of this family.

565
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,460
When you abide by the rules,
any business becomes stale and boring.

566
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,670
But not this time.
Nothing can disrupt our business.

567
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,920
Except, we don't have an extra
50 thousand to spare.

568
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,040
If we take the money out of the business,
it might backfire on us.

569
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,600
Unless that's what you want?

570
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:00,090
Then, write a receipt first.

571
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:03,380
A receipt?
It's just a piece of paper.

572
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,560
The rules are the rules.

573
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:10,420
Fine.
Otogi, bring ink and paper.

574
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,540
Ponta, it's me.

575
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,860
Thank you for coming.

576
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,700
Did the birth go well?

577
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,530
Yes.

578
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:00,250
Oh boy!
That yelling scared me.

579
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,900
Must have fallen asleep.

580
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,680
Since it's over,
you might go to sleep too.

581
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:12,050
I had a very hard time
before giving birth.

582
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:14,940
Is it a boy or a girl?

583
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:16,730
A boy.

584
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:28,270
"For a boy, it's 50 thousand."

585
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,240
But 50 thousand for what?

586
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,460
I don't have that kind of money
on me, so I wrote a receipt.

587
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:52,720
With that kind of money, I would have
no worries for the rest of my life.

588
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:58,820
This money is to break off the relationship
between me and the baby.

589
00:55:59,930 --> 00:56:03,160
The least you could do is think
of a name for him.

590
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:07,040
A name, huh?
That's difficult.

591
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:12,060
I know! What if we take the second
kanji of your name? It'll be Taro.

592
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:18,490
That's too predictable, don't you think?
Do you have any better ideas?

593
00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,340
This name will ensure he's healthy.
It's decided.

594
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:53,180
FIGHT COURAGEOUSLY FOR YOUR COUNTRY

595
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:19,060
After what happened in Manchuria,
business has been going downhill.

596
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:22,270
That's why such cheap establishments
are flourishing.

597
00:57:22,290 --> 00:57:24,000
Is this your first time here?

598
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,880
I haven't been beyond the
Dōtonbori bridge much.

599
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,520
So, why did you decide
to come today?

600
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,730
My life has become boring.
I want some fun.

601
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,360
No wonder such places
are growing in popularity.

602
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:43,290
Why are you sad?
Do we bore you?

603
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:50,120
She's always like that when she
doesn't fancy something.

604
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,080
And what does she fancy?

605
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,200
She's interested in
very expensive things.

606
00:57:56,910 --> 00:57:57,910
Precious stones?

607
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:03,740
What, then? How will I know
if you're silent like a doll?

608
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,690
- Horses.
- Horses?

609
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:07,830
Race horses.

610
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:11,040
So, you like gambling?

611
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:16,750
Not at all.
It's not the same as gambling.

612
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:22,190
Buying a race horse
and betting wisely...

613
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:24,300
can give you a huge profit.

614
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:30,040
And if your horse is winning, on top
of that, you can make a fortune!

615
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,150
What's this?

616
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:42,470
I'm sorry.
I cut several fabrics to make belts.

617
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:46,980
I took three of them,
each with a different color...

618
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:53,740
and set aside seven
other colors.

619
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:58,140
I've heard that bright colors help to
overcome grief.

620
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,650
If this is such a burden for you,
why did you decide to give birth?

621
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:12,360
I guess it's easy to give a new life,
but it's hard to rebuild your own.

622
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:15,120
I am well aware of that.

623
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,000
You're so conservative.

624
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:20,140
I'm an old-fashioned woman,
that's true.

625
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:25,560
Do you feel alright?
You look pale...

626
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:30,120
I have so much on my
plate right now.

627
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:32,380
I can't afford to get sick.

628
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:35,440
Don't despair and don't
give in to superstitions.

629
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,870
I'm giving birth at 33 for the first time.
I need more than a colorful belt.

630
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,640
I need everything rainbow-colored,
even tabi.

631
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:45,180
Rainbow-colored tabi?

632
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,110
Rainbow-colored...

633
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:51,820
I have some work to do.
I'll come back later.

634
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:07,970
Excellent colors!

635
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:09,610
Yes, the dye is very good.

636
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:12,900
Red violet and sky blue
for women.

637
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,300
The other three colors for men.

638
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,080
Master!

639
01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:21,620
In the past, it was customary for
men to wear black tabis only.

640
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:25,070
Producing colorful tabi
is a great idea.

641
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,400
But even if we start now,
we might not make it before winter.

642
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:32,280
So, we need to speed up and produce
the first batch as quickly as possible.

643
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:35,640
Because of reduced imports,
we won't be able to freely produce...

644
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,730
and sell them like before.

645
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,680
If we think about that,
we might as well just shut up shop.

646
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,040
In times of crisis, people want
to buy high-quality goods.

647
01:00:45,090 --> 01:00:48,750
I know how customers think.
I'm sure it will work.

648
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:54,730
Everyone thinks I'm a womanizer,
but I know a thing or two about business.

649
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:20,120
Great! It's my horse!
It's my horse!

650
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:22,980
The one I bought you?

651
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,620
It's the other way round.

652
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:29,780
I know that.

653
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:33,100
It's number five.

654
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,120
I see.

655
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,220
Oh no, the others are overtaking it.

656
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:41,280
What a shame!

657
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:45,660
Next year, we'll definitely win.

658
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,100
Are you not cold?

659
01:01:47,310 --> 01:01:48,690
Me? Not at all.

660
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,120
My idea of colorful tabi was a failure.
Maybe that's why I'm so cold.

661
01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:54,840
Maybe you caught a cold?

662
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:57,220
I want to see our horse.

663
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,840
<i>Here are the final standings.</i>

664
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:07,440
<i>Number three came first.</i>

665
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:09,860
<i>Number five came second.</i>

666
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,060
Don't look.
I need to clean up here.

667
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,260
Okay, I'll take off my coat.

668
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,060
Here, this is a present from me.
A cigarette case made from deer skin.

669
01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:45,490
I wanted to give it to you
in the restaurant.

670
01:02:48,140 --> 01:02:50,340
I shouldn't have bought it,
should I?

671
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:57,760
It's the first time in my life that I got a
present. Thank you. Thank you so much.

672
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,880
How many women did
you have before me?

673
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,110
I like women which
money can't buy.

674
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,220
And I like your extravagance.

675
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:20,400
My extravagance, you say?

676
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,750
What is it? Are you sick?

677
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,500
You have a high fever.

678
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,310
It's not a good time
to get sick.

679
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,500
Wait, can't you get up?

680
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:58,720
You really caught a cold,
after all.

681
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:03,510
Come on, stand up.
What shall I do now?

682
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,450
He's over there.

683
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:14,770
Good evening.
We apologize for the late intrusion.

684
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:19,210
This is so presumptuous,
but let us go to the master.

685
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,130
Wasuke, maybe we
shouldn't move him?

686
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:35,450
But the madam ordered us to
bring him home.

687
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:41,880
Put this on, please.

688
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:56,050
Hold him tight.
We have to go, goodbye!

689
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:16,790
Saijiro, come in.

690
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:23,670
Come closer.

691
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:38,420
- Next year, you're going to kindergarten.
- I won't go.

692
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:43,700
Grandma says other children will bully
me, so I don't need to go there.

693
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:46,620
Dad says you're going,
so you're going.

694
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:51,850
Stop crying like a little girl.

695
01:05:57,330 --> 01:06:03,350
We're taking care of him now.
You two should get along.

696
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:09,930
Saijiro, go over there.
Grandma has something for you.

697
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,420
You seem to be getting better.

698
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,590
I can't get up yet.

699
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,860
Don't wear business suits
anymore.

700
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:32,640
When you wear them, you look like
a walking straw scarecrow.

701
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:38,530
You were unconscious for two days.
We didn't know what to do.

702
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,240
You gave us quite the scare.

703
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:42,640
I'm sorry.

704
01:06:43,790 --> 01:06:48,440
I've heard you were seen with
a beautiful woman.

705
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,700
We just spent the night together.

706
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:57,190
I guess that went according to the rules.
Ponta and Ikuko...

707
01:06:57,470 --> 01:07:02,490
both get their monthly
allowance from our store.

708
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:07,329
If you hook up with another woman,
it won't do us any good.

709
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,330
Grandma!

710
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:14,960
I'm over 30 already. I don't need you getting
involved in my relationships with women.

711
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,960
I'm just saying to be careful, that's all.
The third one might also want a family.

712
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:24,410
Plus, there's also our reputation.

713
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,180
If I were afraid of public disapproval, I
wouldn't have decided to get married again.

714
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:33,590
Did you find a wife?

715
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,820
It will be better for my son.

716
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,880
But if you disapprove, I won't.

717
01:07:45,060 --> 01:07:50,960
And, one more thing, I don't want to
take part in your women's intrigues.

718
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,400
You think that, apart from
a woman from the Kawachi family...

719
01:07:56,790 --> 01:08:00,910
no one is good enough
for me to marry.

720
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:07,040
Outsider women are not suitable
for the role of my wife.

721
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:10,820
But they are allowed to
bear my children.

722
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:18,250
At the same time, they're not a burden to
our family, so there's no need to fret.

723
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:26,090
No wonder your name means "eternal joy."
Okay, we won't worry needlessly.

724
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:32,610
I made some inquiries and found
out that Ikuko gave birth to a child.

725
01:08:33,220 --> 01:08:37,220
A baby was born?
Why didn't she tell me?

726
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:40,070
You'll have a chance to
ask her that yourself.

727
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:46,580
But, right now, you can't
leave this house.

728
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:55,310
That's another son and
another 50 thousand.

729
01:08:56,300 --> 01:08:58,840
Horrible news!
Something happened to Ikuko.

730
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,020
What happened?

731
01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:03,530
All of the sudden, she died...

732
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:13,680
What a shame.
She was such a nice girl.

733
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,420
This is the first time a woman
has died because of me.

734
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:27,190
Kikuji, you're not going anywhere.
These are the rules of our family.

735
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:33,480
The head of the family cannot see the concubine's
dead body or be present at her funeral.

736
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,020
I can't go even if I wanted to.
Not with this fever.

737
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:43,330
Let Wasuke handle the affairs regarding
the burial. And try to sleep.

738
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:46,750
I am sleeping already!
Can't you see?

739
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:55,490
I have nothing against
your mistresses.

740
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:02,800
They not only bring you pleasure...

741
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:09,320
but they also bring sons
to our family.

742
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:17,000
I hope, one day, a nice girl
will give you a daughter too.

743
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:22,420
It's better to talk about
that next time, mum.

744
01:10:22,450 --> 01:10:25,990
I was in Hamayu today
and met Ofuku.

745
01:10:27,670 --> 01:10:34,110
I hope she will be the one to give
you a daughter.

746
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:42,260
She's just not capable
of conceiving boys.

747
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:47,300
And after the girl is born, we can think
about finding a suitable husband for her.

748
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:56,210
After all, the Kawachi family has been thriving
up until the third generation thanks to heiresses.

749
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:00,950
Men join the family only
after getting married.

750
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:09,890
Let Saijiro be the head of the family, but let Ofuku's
daughter bring a worthy husband into our house.

751
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,400
When that happens, I can rest.

752
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:19,560
Are you sure Ofuku will
give birth to a girl?

753
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:28,310
Ofuku is predisposed to give birth to
girls. Besides, she's in excellent health.

754
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:34,670
Look. She has the same
body type as me.

755
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:42,750
That makes me so jealous!
Your body is more beautiful than mine.

756
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,940
Ikuko has already left us.

757
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:37,370
Thank you for helping me. At least,
this way I can say goodbye to her.

758
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:45,150
I couldn't show my face
at the funeral.

759
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:49,440
A prostitute...

760
01:12:49,910 --> 01:12:52,110
can break off the relationship...

761
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,260
with her patron at any time.

762
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:06,320
Hug me. Hug me tight.
I can't stop myself from crying.

763
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:09,820
Don't cry.
It's not good for you.

764
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,760
Just another woman died.
That's all there is to it.

765
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:22,410
I need to forget about her. Otherwise,
I can't be the head of the family.

766
01:13:23,660 --> 01:13:27,190
But I can't forget her.
And it makes me feel so helpless.

767
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:31,910
Master.

768
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:42,730
If you don't mind,
I can try to comfort you.

769
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:19,210
I can't.
I wanted the third one to be the last.

770
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:24,560
But, on the day of Ikuko's funeral,
it's happening for the fourth time.

771
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,980
It was an accident that I was here,
so it doesn't count.

772
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:31,750
- An accident?
- Yes.

773
01:14:32,990 --> 01:14:34,640
Didn't my grandma send you?

774
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,720
The old mistress told me...

775
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,450
that before getting you a baby...

776
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:43,930
I should ask if you want it.

777
01:14:45,340 --> 01:14:47,700
But I'm sterile.

778
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:50,120
You can't have children?

779
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:51,310
That's right.

780
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:58,120
Even though I'm in excellent health,
strangely I can't conceive.

781
01:15:03,170 --> 01:15:04,480
You can't.

782
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:07,960
But grandma doesn't know it!

783
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,280
Sorry, I almost stumbled.
It's so dark.

784
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,200
Look where you're walking, idiot!

785
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,370
And turn off that stupid flashlight!
Who the hell are you?

786
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,435
I'm from the tabi store in the port.

787
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:42,959
And what is a tabi salesman doing
here at this hour of the night?

788
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:45,960
You're in great physical shape.
Which fores are you in?

789
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:47,540
I'm in the people's guards.

790
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:51,560
And why are you there with
such a strong built?

791
01:15:53,290 --> 01:15:57,580
Since you can't answer me clearly,
maybe you're a spy?

792
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:00,360
No.
I need to visit a sick friend.

793
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,220
A sick friend?
What's his name?

794
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,340
I mean, the illness is
not so serious...

795
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,440
If that's the case, why visit someone
during the emergency period?

796
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:12,900
Because the patient has no one else to
rely on and I'm worried.

797
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,220
So, where are you headed?

798
01:16:14,340 --> 01:16:15,340
To Sennen.

799
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,430
There's nothing but whore houses there.
Are you going to see a woman?

800
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:26,260
Is she your lover?

801
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,060
No...

802
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:30,590
Having fun with whores in these
hard times? You scumbag!

803
01:16:31,210 --> 01:16:33,300
Come with me!
To the station!

804
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,940
Sorry for the trouble.

805
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:49,960
Sorry I called you so late.

806
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,610
Not at all.
I was happy to help.

807
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:56,830
They said that, according to the rules,
there has to be a guarantor, so I chose you.

808
01:16:56,900 --> 01:17:01,740
I heard you're responsible for supplying
uniforms, so you should know what to do.

809
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,580
You have so many things!
Let me help.

810
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:07,330
Don't worry.
They are just tabi.

811
01:17:07,380 --> 01:17:08,380
Tabi?

812
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:11,520
If we can exchange them,
we can get the necessary things.

813
01:17:11,590 --> 01:17:13,290
I'm planning to come more often.

814
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,650
What size?

815
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:22,110
I'll go to one more house, just so
I don't have return with these.

816
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:27,870
They say you're still taking care
of your women.

817
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:33,150
And that's why you
didn't run away.

818
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:36,560
I'm working hard.

819
01:17:37,370 --> 01:17:40,360
I heard your grandma and
your mother were evacuated.

820
01:17:40,530 --> 01:17:44,460
I asked them to stay in Kawachi,
but they said they'd feel lonely there.

821
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:47,280
So, you were left alone?

822
01:17:47,510 --> 01:17:50,500
It's just Wasuke and I.

823
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:56,120
So, it's all over now.

824
01:17:57,130 --> 01:18:02,080
I like this kind of freedom.
There are no more women's intrigues...

825
01:18:18,980 --> 01:18:20,780
Wasuke!
The phone is ringing.

826
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:28,410
Hello? It's the Kawachi family!
Oh, it's you?

827
01:18:29,630 --> 01:18:34,530
What? What about Taro?
Huh? Speak clearly!

828
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:45,130
After school, he hit one of his
classmates with a schoolbag.

829
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:48,500
Then, the other kids mobbed him
and beat him up.

830
01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:49,950
Is he badly hurt?

831
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:54,820
He needed a few stitches
on his face.

832
01:18:57,480 --> 01:19:01,190
Don't cry, no one died.
How much longer?

833
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:03,470
We're almost there.

834
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,800
I'll feel better if you come with me.

835
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:34,240
Come in, please.
Sorry for the mess.

836
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:36,640
Thank you.

837
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:40,030
Mum! You've arrived!

838
01:19:40,180 --> 01:19:43,000
Taro!
Your dad is also here.

839
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:50,690
So, you're my father?

840
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:53,090
That's right.

841
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,680
Why did you start it
if you can't fight?

842
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:01,130
There were too many of them.
Maybe seven or eight?

843
01:20:01,380 --> 01:20:04,910
Does it hurt?
Mum will take care of you now.

844
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:06,630
What were you thinking?

845
01:20:07,050 --> 01:20:11,500
When I grow up, I'll be a owner of
a tabi shop. They will all be jealous.

846
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:18,760
Even though I was born out of wedlock,
I can become a Osaka salesman too.

847
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:20,570
Am I right?

848
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:22,260
You are!

849
01:20:24,770 --> 01:20:27,670
This kid is so...

850
01:20:28,420 --> 01:20:31,650
"Determined", you wanted to say?
You don't need to cry.

851
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:47,500
That's right.

852
01:20:48,590 --> 01:20:54,310
Ikuko's son's foster parents live
at the next station.

853
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:08,830
I apologize for this late visit. The
train got delayed in the previous station.

854
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:12,050
Not a problem.
We're glad to see you anytime.

855
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,810
Actually, I came so late to
avoid the attention.

856
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,099
Sorry, the lights are already
out in the house.

857
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:20,190
Well... is he already asleep?

858
01:21:20,220 --> 01:21:21,130
I'll wake him up.

859
01:21:21,160 --> 01:21:24,680
There's no need to.
I just wanted to make sure he's fine.

860
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,540
Is that so?
Come in, please.

861
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:37,160
Would you like some tea?

862
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,470
He looks so much like Ikuko.

863
01:23:56,940 --> 01:24:01,910
The more explosions there are,
the angrier people seem to get.

864
01:24:10,750 --> 01:24:13,100
I found some things that
were intact.

865
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:14,970
Really now?

866
01:24:15,060 --> 01:24:18,810
In the bomb shelter, things
were not damaged at all.

867
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,330
I see.

868
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:06,010
Fortunately, this warehouse
survived the fire, at least.

869
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:12,480
My whole body feels numb.
I'd like to lie down right now.

870
01:25:13,180 --> 01:25:14,620
Shall we sleep, Wasuke?

871
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:19,280
We worked all night.
And I can see you're exhausted too.

872
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,170
Master, should we boil
some rice?

873
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:24,920
Are you hungry?

874
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,320
I think so.

875
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:27,590
I'm not sure anymore.

876
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,800
Master, you're alive!

877
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:48,990
I ran away without even
taking anything.

878
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:54,760
Your warehouse didn't burn down, master.
I'm so glad.

879
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:57,780
It was built so well.

880
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:07,750
I thought you needed something
from the warehouse.

881
01:26:08,050 --> 01:26:13,440
I was afraid that I would not find the shop among
the scorched ruins. Glad that wasn't the case.

882
01:26:13,820 --> 01:26:15,990
I'm glad it survived.

883
01:26:16,060 --> 01:26:19,150
We need to think about the food.
And you two need to rest.

884
01:26:19,220 --> 01:26:20,240
Us two?

885
01:26:32,600 --> 01:26:38,300
Master, it's me.
I'm sorry I took so long.

886
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,980
I was drinking shochu with
an acquaintance of mine...

887
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:48,390
and looking at the view of
burnt-down Osaka.

888
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,600
It's so nice here.

889
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:57,620
Master, if you happen to have sake
here, let's have a drink together.

890
01:26:57,650 --> 01:27:00,950
You've had enough already.
Go get some rest, okay?

891
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:04,830
Yes, thank you.
Have a good night, then.

892
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,270
Excuse me.

893
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:40,010
Master, things are about to get worse.
What are we going to do?

894
01:27:42,040 --> 01:27:43,700
We won't survive without trade.

895
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:44,950
Huh? Trade?

896
01:27:46,410 --> 01:27:48,600
Even if we have a small
wooden shop...

897
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,900
we can still continue to do business.

898
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:58,750
Master, forgive me, but I'm
thinking of leaving Osaka.

899
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:05,500
But you are indeed the fifth-generation merchant
of the House of Kawachi and I admire your spirit.

900
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:13,510
Stop flattering me.
I just can't leave everything as it is.

901
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:39,630
Mum!

902
01:28:42,830 --> 01:28:43,930
Grandma!

903
01:28:45,310 --> 01:28:49,830
Now, it wasn't the best time
to come back here.

904
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,200
Why have you come back?

905
01:28:58,540 --> 01:29:04,190
I heard the warehouse burned down.
I couldn't stop myself from coming.

906
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,310
Get up, everyone!

907
01:29:31,680 --> 01:29:33,580
Come on! Get up!

908
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:07,460
I have about 100 thousand
left right now.

909
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:15,280
If we divide this money between the six of us,
each one of you will get about 15 thousand.

910
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:21,920
It's enough to live comfortably for the rest of
your life. Take the money and go to Tōdai-ji temple.

911
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,560
Why are you doing this?

912
01:30:31,890 --> 01:30:35,700
What are we supposed to do
in that rural temple?

913
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,900
If you stay here, you'll die during
the next bombing raid.

914
01:30:39,060 --> 01:30:41,460
Thank you.
I'll take my share.

915
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:48,640
Then, I guess it's better to
obey master's orders.

916
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:10,210
We lost everything.
And you're still spoiling your concubines.

917
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:19,500
Not only do you treat me and your mother like
cattle, but you've also burned down the shop!

918
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:21,460
What are you talking about?

919
01:31:21,550 --> 01:31:24,970
Wasuke and I carried water
to put down the fire!

920
01:31:26,310 --> 01:31:34,370
This warehouse is a place meant for men.
We earned what we had with blood and sweat.

921
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:41,840
And you took advantage of the bombing
raid to destroy everything we built!

922
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,960
Mum, what are you talking about?

923
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:52,440
And you couldn't even survive a couple of years
on your own. You're always hiding behind me.

924
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:58,340
Mum, do you agree with
what grandma just said?

925
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:01,890
Do you also hate me for giving
away the money?

926
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:07,050
Don't ask me such a thing.
I can't think clearly right now.

927
01:32:08,910 --> 01:32:11,700
I don't know what to do anymore.

928
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:36,140
Take them to the temple and
ask the priest to take care of them.

929
01:32:36,230 --> 01:32:38,240
Yes, I understand.
You can count on me.

930
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:40,370
Well, master,
it's time to say goodbye.

931
01:32:55,080 --> 01:32:58,140
Master, please look after Taro.

932
01:32:58,980 --> 01:33:06,770
Oh, that's right!
I completely forgot about Taro.

933
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:13,610
I'm counting on you.
Farewell!

934
01:33:30,300 --> 01:33:34,250
Help! The old mistress... she...
she fell into the river!

935
01:33:57,130 --> 01:34:01,730
It's my mistake.
I wasn't keeping an eye on her.

936
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:03,950
I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

937
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:09,790
It was mother's wish to die at Kawachi's
house, that's why she came back.

938
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:14,300
I think she saw something
in the river.

939
01:34:15,210 --> 01:34:20,190
She bent down her body to get a
closer look and suddenly fell.

940
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:24,540
I saw it with my own eyes.
She just slipped.

941
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:31,100
Kikuji, now that grandma is dead,
you're the only one I have left.

942
01:34:36,870 --> 01:34:40,320
<i>The women went to the temple
and didn't know what happened.</i>

943
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:45,950
<i>I learned about it a year later...</i>

944
01:34:46,720 --> 01:34:50,820
<i>when I decided to secretly
pay them a visit.</i>

945
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:58,830
<i>The war was over and they
were making plans...</i>

946
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:03,920
<i>about what to do when they go
back to Osaka.</i>

947
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:09,340
<i>They could not resign themselves to
remain in that rural wilderness.</i>

948
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:03,000
I wrote a letter ten months ago,
but there's still no reply.

949
01:36:03,640 --> 01:36:06,700
Could it be that we've lost touch
with him forever?

950
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:11,200
Or maybe that old hag is intercepting
and destroying our mail.

951
01:36:11,840 --> 01:36:14,340
I'm tired of being in the
middle of nowhere.

952
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:17,540
I want to go back to Osaka and
start my own business.

953
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,830
You mean horse racing?

954
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:25,290
My father lost everything on horses.
I want to succeed where he didn't.

955
01:36:25,650 --> 01:36:27,410
If I win, I'll become rich.

956
01:36:27,860 --> 01:36:31,600
And I'm looking for two or three partners
to start my own business.

957
01:36:31,650 --> 01:36:33,240
You want to be a geisha again?

958
01:36:33,430 --> 01:36:36,380
I really like it.

959
01:36:42,420 --> 01:36:44,520
The water is really hot.

960
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:47,650
Come on, girls!
Join in.

961
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:49,300
I'm on my way!

962
01:36:58,220 --> 01:36:59,990
Ofuku, what about you?

963
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:01,910
Well...

964
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:09,490
The money I got when I left Osaka
is enough for me to live on.

965
01:37:10,350 --> 01:37:14,410
So, I'm planning to enjoy my life.

966
01:37:15,850 --> 01:37:19,150
I'll think about the future later.

967
01:37:19,520 --> 01:37:23,420
Ofuku, you have the most beautiful skin.
Can I touch it?

968
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:25,680
Ah, it's so pretty!

969
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:28,960
You girls are so naughty!

970
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:31,860
So obscene!

971
01:37:39,800 --> 01:37:42,580
Ponta, what is that glistening
in your teeth?

972
01:37:43,810 --> 01:37:44,910
It's a diamond.

973
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,800
A diamond?

974
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:54,460
They took all my rings during the interrogations,
but didn't notice the diamond in my teeth.

975
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:06,340
So, what happened to them?

976
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:16,910
When everybody else was having such a rough time, they
were whooping it up. They were all plump and rosy.

977
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:24,800
Even when I try to rethink what I was doing with
these women, it was doomed from the beginning.

978
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:29,680
I saw them only as these fleshy
things called women.

979
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:36,720
Oh boy, was I ever happy. That was the
end of my life as a prodigal son.

980
01:38:37,670 --> 01:38:44,090
I had never thought I could free myself of
women with such a clean, refreshed feeling.

981
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:46,790
And what happened to you?

982
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:49,810
I left the temple after that.

983
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:54,720
The next day, I asked Wasuke to send
money to settle everything.

984
01:38:55,740 --> 01:38:58,660
All my problems went away with
my grandma and mum too.

985
01:39:00,820 --> 01:39:02,320
So, that's what happened!

986
01:39:02,940 --> 01:39:05,960
It's impossible for money to
solve all the problems...

987
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:09,330
regarding the women from your
own family.

988
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:12,820
My sons Taro and Saijiro joined me.

989
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:18,900
We talked and decided that I would not be
stupid and follow my grandma's rules.

990
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:27,740
Then, my mother died too, and finally,
I was completely free of women.

991
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:30,480
I see.

992
01:39:31,620 --> 01:39:34,210
So, that's how your real life started.

993
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:37,520
And that's when you
could finally rest?

994
01:39:37,980 --> 01:39:40,020
- Finally rest?
- That's right!

995
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:41,460
I see.

996
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:45,520
So, whose death anniversary
do we have today?

997
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:50,030
After the war ended, I married
for a second time.

998
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,130
She was different from all
my other previous women.

999
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:58,240
She was hard-working.
But she died young.

1000
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:02,340
I see.
So, that's how it was.

1001
01:40:03,910 --> 01:40:05,510
Taro has the business acumen.

1002
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:10,480
Saijiro is different, but he was able to
fund his own transport company.

1003
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:13,970
What? Are you still here?

1004
01:40:14,120 --> 01:40:16,960
I'm a bit under the weather.
Had to go to the toilet again.

1005
01:40:17,110 --> 01:40:19,010
Maybe it was something you ate?

1006
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,420
Dad, have you made your decision
about that thing we discussed?

1007
01:40:22,490 --> 01:40:26,390
I'm not going to sell the house.
I want to start my own business here.

1008
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:29,870
Business?
Where will you get the funding for that?

1009
01:40:29,890 --> 01:40:31,370
I'll think of something.

1010
01:40:31,390 --> 01:40:33,300
Are you going to make tabi again?

1011
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,330
Making tabi is the only
business I know about.

1012
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:40,060
We had to sell the land where
the shop used to be...

1013
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:44,200
precisely because you're so obsessed
with your precious tabi.

1014
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:48,330
You don't have to worry.
This time, I'll succeed.

1015
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,590
There are so many memorial
tablets here.

1016
01:40:53,100 --> 01:40:55,980
For all those women I
just told you about.

1017
01:40:56,640 --> 01:40:58,190
Are they all dead?

1018
01:40:58,830 --> 01:41:03,870
I wonder. I don't know what
happened to all of them.

1019
01:41:05,200 --> 01:41:08,400
For me, it's as if they are dead.

1020
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,960
So, I wanted to have one day
to remember all of them.

1021
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:16,430
My mother died for real, though.
Cerebral hemorrhage.

1022
01:41:17,010 --> 01:41:19,110
Taro, you know...

1023
01:41:21,210 --> 01:41:22,660
Give me some money.

1024
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:32,060
We've been sitting for too long,
it's time to go.

1025
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:34,660
Here, take this.

1026
01:41:34,690 --> 01:41:37,550
No, no. I can't.
It makes me embarrassed.

1027
01:41:37,980 --> 01:41:39,250
Sorry I disturbed you.

1028
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,120
Not at all.

1029
01:41:46,220 --> 01:41:48,540
Be careful with the cars
on the road!

1030
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,750
Auntie Otogi, I'm off too.

1031
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:00,610
Has our guest already left?

1032
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:06,680
And master left too.
I should have seen him off.

1033
01:42:06,930 --> 01:42:11,500
It's so hard to negotiate with him.
He refuses to sell this house.

1034
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:15,400
He just can't seem to understand
he can't sell his socks here.

1035
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:22,410
And he keeps telling the same story
to all of his new friends.

1036
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:27,560
Sometimes I wonder
if it's true at all.

1037
01:42:30,370 --> 01:42:31,380
Of course it is.

1038
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:32,770
Really?

1039
01:42:33,390 --> 01:42:36,900
I guess Auntie Otogi has known my
father for a long time.

1040
01:42:39,050 --> 01:42:42,210
Do you also want to stay
in this house?

1041
01:42:42,860 --> 01:42:47,390
I'd like to live here until
you find a wife.

1042
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,170
Well, women aren't for me!

1043
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:52,940
After hearing dad's stories,
I started to stray away from them.

1044
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:56,380
The old master is a
very kind man.

1045
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,300
Auntie Otogi, are you perhaps
in love with father?

1046
01:43:04,120 --> 01:43:05,940
It's not like that.

1047
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:08,370
Excuse me, I have to go now.

1048
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:17,640
I'll be waiting.

1049
01:43:32,150 --> 01:43:35,340
Even though the old master
comes from a rich family...

1050
01:43:36,170 --> 01:43:39,520
he's very strong-willed.

1051
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:44,840
Had he been born under
different circumstances...

1052
01:43:46,180 --> 01:43:49,530
he could have become
as kind as his father.

1053
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,300
He could have been a good
head of the family.

1054
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:26,570
THE END
