So many people are going to Bukhara.

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,320

(sings in Uzbek)

19
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,560
Hold him! Stop him!

20
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,160
This son of a sin has
not paid any tanga!

21
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,960
Ay, yay, yay. Where are
you coming from? And why?

22
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,040
I'm coming from Damascus.
Oh, illustrious Sir.

23
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
My relatives live here in Bukhara.

24
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,160
So, you're going to visit relatives!
Pay a guest fee!

25
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,360
But I'm not coming as a guest.
I have an important business here.

26
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,880
Business, ha? Then you'll pay
a guest fee and a business tax.

27
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,920
C'mon, pay, pay, pay, pay!

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,440
Now, contribute something to decorate
the mosque for the glory of Allah,

29
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,120
who has kept you safe
on your journey here.

30
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,600
That's it! Here, here!

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,506
God bless you!

32
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:23,440
Stop! Stop!

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,680
Wait, wait! Stop! Stop!

34
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,280
And who will pay the
fee for your donkey?

35
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,680
Yes, who will pay the fee for you?

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
If you go to visit relatives,

37
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,920
so your donkey is going to
visit relatives, too? Pay up!

38
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,058
That's right! O, wise chief!

39
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:48,720
Indeed, my donkey has many
relatives in Bukhara! -Yes.

40
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,226
Otherwise, Emir would have been
overthrown a long time ago,

41
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,408
and you would have been
executed for your greed!

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,880
Wait, stop! Get him!

43
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,480
I'll get you! I know who you are.

44
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
Our lord Emir will preside
over his court today.

45
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,560
Today?

46
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,680
Yes, if you do not come, you
will be escorted under guards.

47
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,280
Stop! Wait!

48
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,640
For the sake of Allah, don't take
the water in a jug! You'd scare it!

49
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,960
Who?

50
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,160
A bird.

51
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,800
Where?

52
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,800
There!

53
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,720
Look yonder! I see the most
beautiful bird in the world!

54
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,680
Yes, where?
- Shh... You'd scare it!!

55
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,560
There! There! There, see?

56
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
It's not a bird, it's a frog.

57
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
What? A frog?
- Yeah!

58
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,960
If all frogs have such black eyes,
so thin eyebrows and delicate cheeks,

59
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,400
I myself would be a
"croak-croak" frog.

60
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,880
Here I see the most
beautiful girl in the world!

61
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,240
And I see two donkeys!

62
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,360
Only I didn't see
who's ears are longer.

63
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,000
Our ears are shorter than
your eyelashes, beauty.

64
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
A frog!

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,800
Here! Come here! Give us a hand!

66
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,360
What happened? Who's drowning?
- Some rich man is drowning.

67
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,000
We've been trying to save him.
- Come here! Give us a hand!

68
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,960
Hurry up with that rope!
- Wait a minute! What are you doing?

69
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,440
We're trying to save that men!
-You don't save a rich man like that.

70
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,000
Why not?
- Here! Look, look!

71
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,480
See this?
- Yeah!

72
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,000
Here! Take it! Take it!
Here, take it!

73
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,280
That's how you ought to do it.
And you yell "Here, here."

74
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,520
He's drowned!
- Don't worry! Here, take it!

75
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,400
Look, look! Here, take it...

76
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,960
Here! Take it! Take it! Here, take
it! That's how to save a rich man.

77
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
Drowned again! -Here! Take
it! Take it! Here, take it!

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,960
Don't worry, you will not
drown! Here, take it...

79
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
You are my savior!

80
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,720
Come here. I will reward you.

81
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,000
Here!

82
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,440
But I could swim, without your help.

83
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,240
Stop! Here's half a tanga.
Buy yourself a bowl of pilaf.

84
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,600
Here! Take it! Take it!
Here, take it!

85
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,920
Stop! Stop!

86
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,440
It's here!

87
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,560
Take it!

88
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,960
And you say, "Here, come here!"

89
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,560
What are you waiting for, Muslims?

90
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,080
We are waiting for a
righteous and merciful judgment

91
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,720
from our lord and master Emir!

92
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,200
Righteous Emir!

93
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,600
Clear the road for Emir!

94
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,480
Clear the road for Emir!

95
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,800
Clear the road for Emir!

96
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,400
And yet we're in a better position...

97
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
If I fall to the ground,
I would not be hurt!

98
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,240
But if he falls from that
stretcher, he'd be full of bruises.

99
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,880
Yes, yes... I understand!

100
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,200
Allow me, Great Emir,
to announce your decision

101
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,560
which I read from your face.

102
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,760
In the name of Allah, the
Merciful, the Compassionate,

103
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,160
Lord of the Faithful
and our ruler Emir

104
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,200
has granted a great
mercy to blacksmith's guild,

105
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,120
allowing them to feed the guards,

106
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,280
and thus giving his
subjects an opportunity

107
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,360
to be thankful to our illustrious
Emir every day and every hour!

108
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,360
Oh, wise Emir!

109
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,920
Oh, the wisest of the wise!

110
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,520
Oh, wise, with the
wisdom of the wisest...

111
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,760
Enough! Git!

112
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,600
Blacksmith Yusuf, dared
to show ingratitude.

113
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,040
Mm...

114
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,480
So, the Emir graciously decides:

115
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,200
blacksmith Yusuf, in order
to show his repentance,

116
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,080
will be awarded with 200 backlashes.

117
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,360
Well, that blacksmith, has
got righteous and merciful

118
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,040
judgment of our wise Emir.

119
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,800
Come here, worthy Jafar,
Emir will hear you.

120
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,840
Don't cry, Guljan, I will ask
Emir to give us a reprieve.

121
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,320
Oh, great lord! You
shine on us like the sun!

122
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,160
This man owes me one hundred tangas,

123
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,000
and three hundred tangas
interest on that debt.

124
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,000
Total - four hundred tangas.

125
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,960
The deadline to pay his debt,
expired this morning,

126
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,920
and he was unable to pay.
- A reprieve!

127
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,960
I just ask for a
reprieve from great Emir.

128
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,800
Allow me, Great Emir,
to announce your decision...

129
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,960
which I read from His face.

130
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,560
By law, if someone does
not pay a debt on time,

131
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,720
then his whole family goes into
slavery to him to whom he owes!

132
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,880
But the mercy and generosity
of our Lord is boundless.

133
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,160
Although the deadline to
pay the debt has expired,

134
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,160
the Emir confers
potter Niyaz - a reprieve.

135
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,000
One whole hour!

136
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,280
Praise the great mercy
of the Emir, potter Niyaz!

137
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,760
Oh, generous Emir!

138
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:03,240
Oh, kind Emir!

139
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,880
Har, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har.

140
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,640
Oh, most generous Emir!

141
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,040
Emir is angry.
Take your donkey away!

142
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,680
Angry! Ay, yay, yay! What can I do?

143
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,760
I can not forbid my donkey to
praise the wisdom of our Emir!

144
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,800
Quite, quite!

145
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:43,680
Calm down! Hush! Hush! Oh, you!

146
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,360
Beauty, at noon today

147
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,760
you and your father
will come into my home!

148
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,920
Exactly in one hour,
I will come back for you.

149
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,720
Stay here and do not go away!

150
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,280
Why don't you cry?

151
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,240
Why should your daughter cry, potter?

152
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,800
It's useless to cry, because tears
does not turn into silver coins.

153
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,440
We have to try to get the money!

154
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,200
You are mocking at us, stranger!

155
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,160
I don't know anyone in this
town, but I'll try to get it!

156
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,040
To get it! Four hundred
tangas in a strange city!

157
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,480
I'll get the money!

158
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,240
I'll get it for you!

159
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:49,760
Sit here and don't go anywhere!

160
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,320
Where are you going, my good man?
- Why?

161
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,920
This is not a place for a donkey?
- This is not an ordinary donkey.

162
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,120
He asked me to show him
the palace of the Emir.

163
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,160
That's not allowed! Take it away!
- Where?

164
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,800
Not allowed?
- Of course not!

165
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,120
Sorry, I'll show you
the palace next time!

166
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,200
Well! Very good!

167
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,760
Oh, Bul-Bul, you're
making a great progress!

168
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,280
Why do you put that book in
front of your donkey? -Shh...

169
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,080
I'm teaching him to read.

170
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,040
How could it be that
a donkey learn to read?

171
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,280
This is not a common donkey.

172
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,280
God gave him a sharp mind
and a remarkable memory.

173
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,120
It's just he can not turn
the pages. I have to help him.

174
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,680
The Emir called me once and asked:

175
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,000
"Can you teach my
favorite donkey to write?"

176
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,000
I'll try. Where is it?

177
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:24,000
He showed it to me. I checked
his abilities... and I said:

178
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,560
"Oh, illustrious Emir!
This is a wonderful donkey!

179
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,600
He is as clever,
as any of your ministers!

180
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,000
Maybe even as you are.

181
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,000
I will teach him. He will
know as much as you know.

182
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,480
And maybe even more.

183
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,840
But for this, I need twenty years!"

184
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Then the Emir gave me a
purse of gold, and said:

185
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,440
"If after twenty years, my
donkey would not be reading,

186
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,680
I would cut off your head."
- Oh!

187
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,080
Unfortunate!

188
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,880
You will loose your head!

189
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:19,520
After 20 years, someone is bound to
die. Either I, or donkey, or Emir.

190
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,240
You couldn't be the Nasreddin,
could you?

191
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,480
I urgently need four hundred tangas,
exactly four hundred.

192
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:46,560
Well, who will give me four
hundred tangas? Who? Well?

193
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:51,520
I will pay back.
- Nasreddin, I've got no money.

194
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,960
But I can give you this hat,
it's new. -Rahmat! (Thanks!)

195
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,450
Take this from me.
- Rahmat!

196
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,692
Take this from me.
- Rahmat!

197
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:05,000
Rahmat! Rahmat! Rahmat! Rahmat!

198
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,560
Here, take my belt!

199
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,720
And from me, take it, Nasreddin.
- Rahmat!

200
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,240
Take this, Nasreddin!

201
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,360
Take this from me, Nasruddin.
- Rahmat! Little horseman!

202
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,040
And take this from me!

203
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,720
Nasruddin, catch!
- Rahmat! Rahmat!

204
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,040
Nasreddin!
- Rahmat.

205
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,160
Rahmat!

206
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,840
Kapkole!
(Attention!)

207
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,040
A pair of worn shoes.
Still could be used.

208
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
I'll sell it cheap,
only thirty-three tangas.

209
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,320
Five for the shoes,
five for being cheap,

210
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,720
and twenty-three for being
from a poor man's feet.

211
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,880
Kapkole!

212
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,760
A tin bowl,
round like the Emir's head.

213
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,120
Emir never gave a drink to anyone,
but this bowl got drunk 5,000 men!

214
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:39,520
And here... a belt, brand new.

215
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:46,000
Well... Never buy a brand new belt!
You couldn't see anything through it!

216
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,760
Buy it when it is
torn and full of holes.

217
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,840
And you could see the
entire world through it!

218
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,840
Ah, so you are selling these goods?
- And you yelled: "Here, here!"

219
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,480
How much do you want for
all of this together? -Cheap!

220
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,080
Selling cheap, hurry up,
I'll tell you... Come here!

221
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,200
Take it all for 400 tangas.
- You're crazy!

222
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,280
I will give you 200 tangas!
-Two hundred? -Yes!

223
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,400
Two hundred and fifty!

224
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,680
Look at my donkey,
even he laughs at you.

225
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,280
Two hundred and seventy-five!
- Kapkole!

226
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,000
I swear by Allah, I'll overpay twice
for these goods. Here's 300 tangas!

227
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,720
400!

228
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,840
325!

229
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,280
330!

230
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,520
400!

231
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,120
Stop!

232
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,520
400! -350! -400!

233
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,520
360! -400!
-370! - 400!

234
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,400
380! -400!
-390! -400!

235
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,800
395! -400!
-396! -400!

236
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I agree.
- Ugh!

237
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
Okay, okay.
- Quick, quick.

238
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,040
I always suffer losses on
account of my own goodness.

239
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Hey, wait! This one's fake!
-Fake? -Yeah!

240
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:18,320
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Why are you in such a hurry?

241
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:23,560
Umbala Kidon, Umbala Kidon,
Umbala Kidon, Umbala Kidon...

242
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,586
What business makes you
to go in such a hurry?

243
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:35,240
Same as yours!
- But you don't know my business.

244
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:39,040
If you know, you'd be jealous of me.

245
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,800
I want the most
beautiful girl in Bukhara.

246
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:48,920
And now she will be mine. You hear?
- I've heard.

247
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,160
Like a jackal who saw a cherry
high up on a tree, and said:

248
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,200
"No matter what, I'll eat this
cherry." And climbed up on a tree.

249
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,200
He was climbing for two hours,
all bruised and exhausted...

250
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,680
When he finally got to the cherry, the
falcon flew by and grabbed the cherry.

251
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:14,000
And he was coming down the tree for
two hours more, and got more bruised.

252
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,040
And then?
- Then he realized...

253
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,840
that cherries do not
grow for a jackal. -Ah...

254
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,040
Your story about the cherry
does not make any sense.

255
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,680
You're a fool!

256
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,640
Hey, potter, the hour has come.

257
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,000
And now, you and your
daughter will come with me!

258
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,720
This was the girl I
was telling you about.

259
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,240
And do you have the potter's receipt?
- Of course!

260
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,280
Here it is! And the deadline
for the payment has expired!

261
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,140
It hasn't been expired, yet!

262
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,000
Here's your money, loan shark
Jafar! Exactly 400 tangas!

263
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,800
I'm buying the potter's debt.

264
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,440
Receipt!

265
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,920
Your receipt?
- Yes, mine!

266
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,680
Look!

267
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,800
Stranger, tell me your name,
so that I know who to bless!

268
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes, tell me your name, so
that I know who to curse!

269
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,760
In Baghdad, Tehran, Istanbul and
Mecca... everywhere they call me...

270
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,920
Nasreddin.
- Ugh!

271
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,400
Thank you, Nasreddin.
- Frog!

272
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,280
Nasreddin?
- It can not be, Nasreddin.

273
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:19,440
Nasreddin! Nasreddin!
Nasreddin! Nasreddin!

274
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,920
Nasreddin? -Yes!
-In Bukhara? Here?

275
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,480
No... it cannot be!

276
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,560
Turkish Sultan wrote us that he
cut off Nasreddin's head. -He wrote!

277
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,160
Khiva Khan announced that
he skinned him alive! -Yes!

278
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,880
And the Iranian Shah
cut him to pieces...

279
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
Oh!

280
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,800
Get him!

281
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,000
Get him!

282
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,080
Listen... You've been working
for me for two weeks now.

283
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,880
During this time,
I earned 350 tangas!

284
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,960
Half of the money,
rightfully belongs to you.

285
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,600
You're saying very strange things.

286
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,051
What would happen on
this earth, if all masters

287
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:11,956
would start to share their
income with employees?

288
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:16,378
Would Allah and Emir tolerate such
an outrageous violation of the order.

289
00:26:16,511 --> 00:26:18,340
That would be like...

290
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:23,680
What are you looking at?
What did you see?

291
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:28,240
I saw a frog.
The most beautiful in the world!

292
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:42,200
Oh! Her eyebrows are
pretty as the Moon.

293
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:48,280
Teeth like pearls, and breasts like
marble, and shoulders... -Enough!

294
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,000
Where is she? -I can
show you her home. -So?

295
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,120
But should it be some reward for
the worthless servant of Emir? -Um...

296
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,720
Praised be the
generosity of our lord,

297
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:13,720
but my great lord should hurry up,
because someone else wants the girl.

298
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,480
Who would dare?
- Nasreddin

299
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,000
What!? Nasreddin?

300
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,960
Nasreddin, again!

301
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,320
Hey! Arslanbek! Here!

302
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,280
Tomorrow morning, you
shall bring that girl here!

303
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,280
You know, Guljan, I have
long wanted to tell you,

304
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,600
that I... I... Look at that star.

305
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,800
poor thing, it must
be very cold up there.

306
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,520
You know, Guljan, I have
long wanted to tell you...

307
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm very...

308
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:22,200
Look how many thistles
are in my donkey's tail!

309
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,480
He robbed all burdocks
from here to Damascus.

310
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,665
I think I've heard
the sound of a slap?

311
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,587
And you don't put your
lips where you shouldn't.

312
00:28:54,722 --> 00:28:58,840
I'm... Guljan! Guljan?

313
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,960
Eh...

314
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,040
...where you shouldn't.

315
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,960
Oh...

316
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,840
(Nasreddin sings in Uzbek)

317
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,040
You understand what I mean. Yes?

318
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,320
Who would know...

319
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,880
Where to put your lips, and
where you shouldn't... huh?

320
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,960
Oh! Ah!
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Ah!

321
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,600
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Ah!

322
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,680
Painful, is it?

323
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,000
Very, very...

324
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,000
Very?
- Very, uh...

325
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,400
(Sings in Uzbek)

326
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,640
Stop! Stop shouting!

327
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,680
Hush!

328
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,200
Hush!

329
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,120
Hush, father will hear!

330
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,880
Who's there?

331
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,920
By order of Emir... open the door!

332
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,400
They're after you. Run!
Save yourself, my love!

333
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,280
There is a beautiful
rose in your garden.

334
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:16,160
And Emir wishes to decorate
his palace with that rose.

335
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,040
Where is your daughter?

336
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,680
Help!

337
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,520
Father, Father, help me! Father!

338
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,160
Father! Father! Help! Help!

339
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,480
Help!

340
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,640
Wait a minute!

341
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,520
We want to look at her.

342
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:35,560
Today we will deign to be with her.

343
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,600
Jafar! Jafar! Woe to you!

344
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:57,320
I know everything,
you wretched jackal!

345
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,920
Cherry did not grow for the jackal,
nor for the falcon!

346
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,160
The cherry belongs to the lion!
- Ah!

347
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,800
Not yet!

348
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:14,699
And you, Jafar, remember,
I saved you out of the water,

349
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,840
but I swear, I shall drown
you again, in the same pond.

350
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,960
But before that,
you will be executed!

351
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,400
Nasreddin is still in Bukhara.

352
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,160
He hasn't been caught!
Emir is angry.

353
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,681
If you do not catch Nasreddin,
I swear by Allah,

354
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,912
the Emir will hang you all!

355
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,280
And those who catch him,
will get a bounty.

356
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:53,000
Mhm... three thousand tangas.
- Wow!

357
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,360
What do you want?

358
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,917
Gallant soldier, let me through,
to the wives of Emir. -No!

359
00:36:11,152 --> 00:36:14,760
If you wish to know the
cause of your misfortune,

360
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,480
come here and I'll tell you
what threatens your happiness.

361
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,640
(Sings a song in Uzbek).

362
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,400
If you know where Nasreddin
is hiding, tell me.

363
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:50,760
I have to consult with
him about your case.

364
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,520
All right, I'll try
to find Nasreddin.

365
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,000
Have you seen Nasreddin?
- No, I haven't seen him.

366
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,080
Oh, woman... Woe to you!

367
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,960
Black hand of an evil
spirit is upon you.

368
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:39,560
But, I know a way to
prevent it. If you learn...

369
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,560
where Nasreddin is hiding,
come here and tell me.

370
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,280
All right, I will bring Nasreddin
to you! -You will bring him? When?

371
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,200
Right now! He is near.
- Where is he?

372
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,160
He's just waiting to visit you.
- Where is he? I don't see it!

373
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,400
But you are a fortuneteller,
look closer.

374
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,800
He's here!

375
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,280
Well, what evil is threatening me?

376
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,440
And what would you like
to consult with me? Well!?

377
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,680
Guards!

378
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,640
Guards! Guards!

379
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,360
I found him! I found him!

380
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,280
I found him!
He is in the market!

381
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,000
Who?
- He's in the market!

382
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:26,080
Who? -Nasreddin. He's
dressed as a woman.

383
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,960
Ah, so...

384
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,520
And my reward?
Three thousand tangas?

385
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,400
All right! Hey, guards! Hurry!

386
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,600
The reward is mine!
Three thousand tanga!

387
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,000
Hurry! Get him!

388
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,920
(Women scream.)

389
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,040
Muslims! What are you waiting for?

390
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,800
They disgrace our
wives in broad daylight!

391
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,120
What are you doing?
Those are my...

392
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,400
... pots...

393
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,360
Where are you coming from?

394
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
From Baghdad.

395
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:06,000
Show me the way to the palace.

396
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,960
How do I get into the palace? In the
name of Allah, what's happening here?

397
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,360
Who is the master of Bukhara?

398
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,240
We or him?

399
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,160
That damn Nasreddin!

400
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,680
That troublemaker!

401
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:36,360
Who is the master of
Bukhara? We ask you!

402
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,760
We emir, or he emir?

403
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,760
When will I see Nasreddin's head

404
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,240
presented to me on this tray?

405
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,200
In the name of Allah, what
is happening in Bukhara?

406
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,160
Bazaar.
- Bazaar? Bazaar...

407
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,120
This is a riot, not Bazaar!

408
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,720
Now, how would I get to the palace?

409
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,440
Why do you go to the palace?

410
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,200
Let it be known to you, that I am a
famous sage, healer and astrologer.

411
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,680
And I'm coming here from Baghdad
at the invitation of the Emir.

412
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,280
My name is Hussein-Husliya.
- Ah!

413
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,280
Hussein-Husliya!
- Hussein-Husliya.

414
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,240
You can not be the Hussein-Husliya?

415
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,320
Yes, I'm the one.
- Ah!

416
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,760
You wretch!
You're gonna loose your head!

417
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,200
Your head is lost!
- Whose head?

418
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:04,040
Don't you know that all those people
are looking for you? -W-w-what?

419
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,120
I must hide you somewhere?
Let's go!

420
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,880
Hide here.

421
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:19,580
What are you talking about?

422
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,960
Emir was informed that
you are coming from Baghdad

423
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,400
to get into his harem and
to dishonor his wives!

424
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,800
Me... in harem? But I
never said anything like that.

425
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,920
And then, I'm old. What
would I do in the harem?

426
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,840
I don't know! But Emir knew you came
to Bukhara and hiding in the Bazaar.

427
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,040
He ordered, you to be found,
caught and decapitated! -Oh, my god!

428
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,320
I wish I've never been born!
- It's nothing, don't worry!

429
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,840
Allah has much better harem then
Emir! -To Baghdad! To Baghdad!

430
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,640
You would be caught at the gate,
brought to the palace and decapitated.

431
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:02,960
And one of the guards will get a
reward for your head, 3.000 tanga.

432
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,840
3,000 tangas? That means I
can not be saved! Oh, help me!

433
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,280
Oh, help me, good Muslim!

434
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,840
What could I do for you?

435
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:14,880
Oh! Ah... no...

436
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,920
Oh! Ah... no, not that, not that...

437
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,720
Oh! That's it!
I've found it! I know!

438
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,480
That's it! Here is your
salvation! Look, look, now...

439
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,880
Here, put on a woman's dress...

440
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,880
Shame!

441
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,080
You can take cover under this veil,
and pass by the guards, to Baghdad!

442
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,720
Stop!

443
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,520
Where to? -To Baghdad.
-Why?

444
00:43:55,720 --> 00:44:01,680
I'm going back to my wives... I mean,
my husband, to my husband in Baghdad!

445
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,080
Oh! Get down, get down!
- Let go of me, guards let me go...

446
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,480
Ah... This is he!

447
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,080
Oh, you! You don't have heads on
your shoulders, but empty pumpkins.

448
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,760
Announce that we raise
the bounty on his head!

449
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,040
Ten thousand tangas!

450
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,480
And woe to you,
you useless trunks,

451
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,480
if he would not be caught.

452
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,640
Soon, I expect a visit
from Hussein-Husliya,

453
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,560
which I've invited from Baghdad.

454
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,160
A sage, astrologer and physician.

455
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,400
Praised be the sun and the universe!
- Speak!

456
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,160
A man just came to the gates, calling
himself a wise man from Baghdad!

457
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,280
Hussein-Husliya!

458
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,760
Show him in! Call him here!

459
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:20,040
Great Emir, tell me have you
been with your women today?

460
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,120
Let Emir answer to
your worthless slave.

461
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,560
Today? No! We didn't enter the harem.

462
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,960
Oh! Praise be to Allah
that I came in time.

463
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,120
Wait, Hussein-Husliya,
what are you talking about?

464
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:40,360
Praised be Allah, I came in time!

465
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,720
You words are incomprehensible.
- Let it be known to great Emir,

466
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,560
that last night I saw that
the position of the stars

467
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,200
were threatening to the Emir.

468
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,760
The star Alkap, meaning
the sting of death,

469
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,160
was opposite the star
Ashhala, meaning the heart.

470
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,640
So, until the stars do
not change their position,

471
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:12,800
Emir should not touch a woman,
or his death is imminent!

472
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,680
Ay, yay, just today we brought
a new girl to our harem.

473
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,160
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

474
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,440
Forget about her! Forget about her!

475
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,480
Until the stars change position.

476
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,000
Otherwise you would die!

477
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:36,160
And your people would be helpless.

478
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:42,280
Thank you!
Thank you, Hussein-Husliya.

479
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,440
We can see that you
are truly a sage... Yes!

480
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:51,960
And devoted to us! And you...
What are you looking at?

481
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,040
Why are we paying you a
great salary? Have you heard?

482
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,920
Your Emir almost died,
and you didn't even blink about it.

483
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,600
Now, you look at them. Look at
them, Hussein-Husliya... Huh?

484
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,440
What a bunch of stupid faces, huh?
-His Highness Emir is absolutely right!

485
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,720
These faces do not
show a trace of wisdom.

486
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,120
That's right!
Do you hear? Boobies!

487
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:25,880
Besides, let me tell
you that these faces,

488
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,400
do not show any sign of integrity.

489
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,680
The thieves... Thieves, thieves.
All thieves... all thieves...

490
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,840
Would you believe, Hussein-Husliya,

491
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,480
this morning we have forgotten
our favorite belt in the garden.

492
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,200
And when we returned, it was no
longer there. Some of them had...

493
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,760
I see...

494
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,400
You know, Hussein-Husliya...

495
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,000
Allah...

496
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:26,000
Is this the great emir's belt?

497
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,120
It is!

498
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:34,400
Almighty Allah! You
are indeed a great sage!

499
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:41,600
Take this belt as your reward!

500
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,760
Nasreddin is caught!

501
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:46,960
I caught him!

502
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,840
Who are you?

503
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:11,440
Why are you hiding
under women's clothes?

504
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,160
I...

505
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:18,240
I was going to the great,
all-merciful Emir...

506
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:24,400
But I met a man who told me that
Emir wanted to cut off my head.

507
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,400
I was frightened, so I tried to
escape, dressed like a woman.

508
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,160
We wanted to cut off your head?

509
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:36,240
Did we want to cut his head off?

510
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:38,800
Why?

511
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,280
Because I allegedly intended to get

512
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,160
in the harem of the great Emir.
- In our harem?

513
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:50,480
Who are you?
- Me?

514
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,080
I am Hussein-Husliya, wiseman,
healer and astrologer from Baghdad!

515
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,080
Ha, ha, what a lier!
This is Hussein-Husliya!

516
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,360
Who is Hussein-Husliya?
Is he Hussein-Husliya?

517
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,360
I am Hussein-Husliya! He's a
liar! He usurped my name!

518
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:12,280
Forgive me, great lord,

519
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,440
but the old man's
shamelessness has no limits.

520
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,600
He says that I, Hussein-Husliya,
usurped his name! -Yes!

521
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,280
And next he could say
that this is his robe.

522
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,440
Of course! That's my robe!

523
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,800
You see?

524
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,600
Maybe this is your turban?
- Mine!

525
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,480
And these shoes?
- Mine!

526
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,200
The book? -Mine!
-Rosary? -Mine!

527
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,800
Maybe this belt is yours, as well?
- Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

528
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,680
Deceiver! Dodger!

529
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,440
Illustrious lord, now you
see who stands before you.

530
00:50:54,600 --> 00:51:00,240
Today, this deceitful and despicable
old man says that I've usurped his name,

531
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,640
and tomorrow he will say that
this is his palace... -Yes!

532
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,480
... and that Bukhara belongs to him.
- Yes. You're right, Hussein-Husliya!

533
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,960
We can see that this is a dangerous
man. He has dark thoughts in his head.

534
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,400
It is necessary to separate
his head from his body!

535
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:22,600
First, it is necessary to know his real
intentions and why he arrived in Bukhara.

536
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,680
Let me deal with him. I will torture
him and he will tell me his real name.

537
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:35,040
Well, then, take him and torture
him until he confesses everything!

538
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:45,080
Tell me, Hussein-Husliya, what to
do with this wicked Nasreddin? Huh?

539
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,720
Ugh, ugh!

540
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,480
Oh, my great lord!

541
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:53,160
He knows that while I'm in
Bukhara, he has nothing to do here!

542
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,400
And now... tell me...

543
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,680
What about your new prisoner?
Do you know who he is?

544
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,240
Not yet. -Try to change
the torture! -You bet!

545
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,360
Yesterday, I spent the whole day
using iron tongs to loosen his teeth.

546
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,120
Yeah, it's a good torture,
loosening teeth, but...

547
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,400
And today, I will squeeze his
head with a rope loop and a stick.

548
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:22,720
New torture? Good torture!
Using loops and sticks.

549
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,520
What do you want?
- Oh, the great lord!

550
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,480
The star of your harem,
Guljan, is dying!

551
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,280
Dying? How? Ooh!

552
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:40,280
If she would die,
we would be very sad.

553
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:43,680
After all, we've
never been with her!

554
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,000
Hussein-Husliya!
Can you cure Guljan?

555
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:53,360
I've got to see her.
- What? See her?

556
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,640
You want to see her?

557
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,000
Oh, the great lord,

558
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,640
I have to look at her hand, only.

559
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:10,360
I'm a skilled healer. I can determine
her illness, by looking at her nails.

560
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:14,480
I just need a hand.
- Ah, the hand...

561
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,760
Well, it will not hurt us!

562
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,840
Emir himself, and
the doctor with him.

563
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:32,920
Guljan!

564
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,480
My name is Hussein-Husliya.

565
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:43,640
I'm new sage, astrologer
and physician of Emir.

566
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:49,920
You're in danger, and I will save you.
Do you understand me, Guljan?

567
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:55,040
I understand, Hussein-Husliya!
- Give me your hand!

568
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,760
Here.

569
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:04,960
The left! The left... left!

570
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,800
I want to define your illness,
by the color of your nails.

571
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,760
Here! -Here?
-Yes, there!

572
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:20,520
Does your heart aches?
- Yes, my heart!

573
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,880
I am separated from my darling, and
though I feel that he is near me,

574
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,120
I cannot hug or kiss him.

575
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,160
Oh, how I wish that he hugs me?

576
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,600
Almighty Allah! What a passion my master
has inspired in her, in such a short time.

577
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,480
Your lover is near.
- Near, near...

578
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,040
He's thinking of you...
- I think of her, yes...

579
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,600
Day and night, he's
thinking only of you, dear.

580
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,760
Isn't that right, Master?
- Right, right, yes, yes! Of you!

581
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,360
Save me, Hussein-Husliya!

582
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:01,040
Calm down, Guljan!
I, Hussein-Husliya, will save you!

583
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,480
He will save! He'll save you!
- Absolutely!

584
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,640
Thank you, Hussein-Husliya!

585
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,600
She's recovering.
- Ah...

586
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,680
Thank you, you incomparable
healer of diseases.

587
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,920
Dirty dog!
- Very good!

588
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:58,520
Listen, Hussein-Husliya,...

589
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,880
Now you have to scream again.
- Ugh...

590
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:08,680
Don't worry... I've invented
such a nice torture...

591
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,520
squeezing the head with a
rope loop and a stick... Um...

592
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,400
Uh... you son of a sin! Damn you!

593
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,760
May Allah drop a stone on your
head and squash it like this!

594
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,104
Good! But just remember,
you have to scream so loud,

595
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:29,347
that everyone in the whole palace
hear you, and not like the last time.

596
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:34,400
With what? -Huh? -With what?

597
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,520
Loop and stick!

598
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:40,200
Oh... Allah!

599
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,960
No! Not so, not so...

600
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,560
You scream lazy. And they
are experts in such matters.

601
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,760
If they would feel that you pretend,

602
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,880
you would fall in the hands of an
axeman. -Oh, you son of sin!

603
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,240
You should do it like this!

604
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,880
Aaaaa!

605
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,720
Aaaaa!

606
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,200
Aaaaa!

607
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:10,544
You, descendant of the wicked!
I don't have such a voice?

608
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:13,880
Don't worry.
The loop... stick...

609
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,400
Aaaaa!

610
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,720
Aaaaa!

611
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,600
Aaaaa!

612
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,600
Aaaaa!

613
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,800
Aaaaa!

614
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,960
Aaaaa!

615
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:36,160
Calm down.
That's only our Hussein-Husliya,

616
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,880
with a rope loop and a stick.

617
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,720
What a nice torture!

618
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:59,160
Wretched ragamuffin! May you
be eaten alive by a grave worms!

619
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,080
May Allah will open...

620
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,960
a pit under your feet, so that you
fall in it and break your legs.

621
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:10,920
Ay, yay! Why are you mad at me?

622
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,160
Did I disgrace your name?

623
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,880
Or did I defame your knowledge?
Here! Look!

624
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,640
Emir sent this to Hussein-Husliya,
because he cured the girl.

625
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,080
You...!

626
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,960
You cured the girl?

627
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,440
Yes, me!

628
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:34,040
You, ignorant crook, a deadbeat!
What do you know about diseases?

629
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,960
I know nothing about diseases!
But I know about girls!

630
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:44,080
So... it would be fair
to divide this money...

631
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,200
... in half.

632
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,440
To one Hussein-Husliya,
who knows about diseases.

633
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:59,600
And to other Hussein-Husliya,
who knows about girls!

634
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,120
Another one fell.

635
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,320
Where did they fall,
all those stars?

636
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:21,000
On the ground. Where else? -I've
heard, that they fall in the sea.

637
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:26,480
How would you know all this?
- I know!

638
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:31,120
Tell us, tell us, the wise lord...
- Wait a minute!

639
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,560
Tell us, wise Hussein-Husliya,
where do stars fall from the sky?

640
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:38,760
And why people cannot
find them on the ground?

641
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,960
You really don't know?
- No, no, no.

642
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,040
When a star falls to the ground...
- Yes, yes, yes...

643
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,680
... it crumbles into
small silver coins.

644
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,440
Oh, tell us more. More!

645
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,080
Well, then people collect the
coins. I even knew the people

646
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,400
who were enriched in that way.

647
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:59,600
Allah...

648
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:19,200
Oh! If only a single
star would fell here...

649
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:23,560
... we would...
immediately get rich...

650
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,920
Did you hear?
- Yes, I did.

651
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,320
Got it?
- Got it.

652
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,480
Don't worry, Guljan.

653
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,120
Now I will draw their attention.

654
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:30,280
All will be well.

655
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,880
And then you walk away alone.
- No!

656
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,960
Don't worry, Guljan.

657
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,360
Wait for me in the tea house,
with the chaikhana keeper Ali.

658
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,160
Ready!

659
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:52,040
One, two, three.

660
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:58,240
Stop! Who wants to earn
three thousand tangas? Well?

661
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:03,273
Well, catch Nasreddin!
If you dare...

662
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:09,200
Nasreddin! Get him! Catch him!

663
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,600
Catch Nasreddin!

664
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,880
Catch Nasreddin! Get him!

665
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,880
Hey, you! Follow me!

666
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:01,240
Catch Nasreddin! Catch Nasreddin!

667
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,440
Catch Nasreddin! Get him!

668
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:09,800
Catch Nasreddin! Catch Nasreddin!

669
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:13,600
Hussein-Husliya...
- Catch Nasreddin!

670
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,560
Look, if he's here somewhere.

671
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,920
I couldn't find him anywhere.

672
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,520
Hussein-Husliya, come
with us in the bedchamber

673
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:49,000
and protect our sleep.
- No!

674
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,440
Let the Great Emir look at the stars.

675
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:56,720
Now they are in favor to him.

676
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,600
Now, he can touch Guljan.

677
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,880
Today we deign to go to her.
- Oh, the great lord!

678
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:11,600
The pearl of your harem,
Guljan, has been kidnapped.

679
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,120
She has been stolen by
that damn Nasreddin.

680
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:24,640
If you value your
heads, you cowards...

681
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,560
What are these people guilty for?
-They're all concealers of Nasreddin.

682
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:51,600
They will be put to a cruel
death, if they do not hand over

683
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,840
that beggar and the rebel.
- Well, well, well, well...

684
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,480
You're in a hurry to the city?

685
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,240
And now I'm in a hurry to the palace.

686
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,480
In the name of Allah, the
Merciful, the Compassionate...

687
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:16,880
ruler of Bukhara, the moon
and the sun of the universe,

688
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:22,160
weighed on the scales of justice
the crime for hiding

689
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,720
Nasreddin, that blasphemer
and a troublemaker,

690
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,880
deign to decide:

691
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,800
potter Niyaz and
all other concealers,

692
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:37,280
will be put to death by decapitation.

693
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:43,596
If anyone of these convicts would
reveal Nasreddin's whereabouts,

694
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:47,480
he would be freed...

695
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:53,720
and all other convicts
would be pardoned!

696
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:56,520
Potter Niyaz!

697
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:02,520
Can you specify the
hiding place of Nasreddin?

698
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:09,040
No! I will not say
where Nasreddin is?

699
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,120
Period!

700
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:20,440
Order to stop the penalty, oh
lord! And I will catch Nasreddin.

701
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:27,120
Oh, my lord, it wouldn't be fair
to punish these "small potatoes",

702
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,240
before we catch and
execute the main concealer!

703
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,640
What?

704
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:38,160
The man who has been hiding
Nasreddin all the time, even today!

705
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,320
You're right.
If there is such a concealer,

706
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,480
he should be the first
to be decapitated.

707
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:52,160
And if the Great Emir doesn't
want to execute this major concealer,

708
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:57,360
would it be fair to execute
these small concealers?

709
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,720
You're right Hussein-Husliya.

710
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,320
But show us quickly
who's the main concealer

711
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,934
and we shall immediately
cut off his head.

712
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:12,920
Lord of Bukhara says

713
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:19,200
that if he refuses to
execute the main concealer,

714
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:25,240
I'm about to point out,
that all these convicts

715
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,560
will be released!

716
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:32,040
Is this right, oh, my Lord?

717
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,240
You're right, Hussein-Husliya.

718
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:40,680
We are giving our Emir's word!

719
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:47,360
Did you hear that, oh,
people of noble Bukhara?

720
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:52,160
The Emir gives his word!

721
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,640
OK, OK, who's the main concealer?

722
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:59,080
The main concealer
of Nasreddin...

723
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:01,400
Well, well, well...

724
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,600
... is you, Emir!

725
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:12,240
Well, Emir, order them to
cut off your head! Huh?

726
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:20,160
The emir promised to free the
prisoners, we all heard that!

727
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:25,440
Freedom to all convicts!
- Nasreddin!

728
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:31,360
Freedom! Freedom to all convicts!
Freedom to all convicts!

729
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,600
We must free them,
the people could rebel.

730
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,920
Emir keeps his word!

731
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,320
They are free!

732
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:02,680
We have to save Nasreddin!

733
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:15,520
And so, my opinion
is that we should...

734
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:18,280
cut off his head!
- Aah!

735
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,720
That wouldn't do! The Turkish
sultan had already cut off my head.

736
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:28,000
Indeed, the Sultan wrote us that
he had cut of the head of this bum.

737
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:33,200
And yet, he's still alive. We
must take a more sure remedy.

738
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:40,880
It's best to burn him
alive on a nice fire!

739
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,240
Yes, yes, that was done to
me by Khan of Khiva, uh...

740
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,680
Verily! Your heads are
like overripe pumpkins!

741
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,120
Tell me...

742
01:09:59,252 --> 01:10:00,325
Aaaa!

743
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:11,800
Tell me, have you ever been drowned?
- Drowned?

744
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,040
No, no one has ever drowned me.

745
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:20,400
That's it! The only sure way!

746
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:26,440
Tomorrow afternoon, he shall be
publicly drowned in Laba-Hauze!

747
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,280
The spies reported that the
people in the city are worried.

748
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,520
The people may try to
rescue this son of sin.

749
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:45,960
Drown him when night comes...
secretly...

750
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,720
Why, why they set
us free on the court?

751
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,400
It would be better for me to die, than
to know that our Nasreddin is caught.

752
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,560
It is better for all of us to die,
than to let them execute our Nasreddin!

753
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,280
Where, where is our Nasreddin?
What will happen to him?

754
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:08,000
Wait, I want to tell you...

755
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:11,640
I want to tell you...
- What?

756
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,640
Shh...
Do you carry me on your backs?

757
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,120
Well, yes!

758
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,480
What a pity that my donkey
isn't here. -Why is that?

759
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,720
He would have burst out laughing!

760
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,040
(Singing in Uzbek)

761
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:40,600
Phew! I'm tired...

762
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,800
We must rest!

763
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:48,320
Carry him! It's your turn.
We must hurry up.

764
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:52,200
Oh, brave warriors! Wait a minute.

765
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,080
I want to pray before dying.

766
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:57,320
Pray, but not for long!

767
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,280
Oh, God Almighty, do so...

768
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:07,400
that the person who finds
my ten thousand tangas,

769
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:13,080
would give one thousand to the
mosque and asked to pray for me

770
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,280
for the year.

771
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:20,160
Carry me further.

772
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:24,560
I commend my spirit
into the hands of Allah.

773
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:30,000
We would give three thousand
tangas to the mosque.

774
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,040
We're not evil people!

775
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,040
Tell us where did
you hide your money?

776
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,200
Where are we now?

777
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,520
This is the road through the
cemetery, at the northern gate.

778
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,320
The northern gate?

779
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:50,600
This is the will of Allah. At the
south entrance, on the other side

780
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:54,520
of the cemetery, there are three
old tombstones, placed in a triangle.

781
01:12:54,640 --> 01:13:00,800
Under each of them,
I buried 3,333 tangas.

782
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:04,560
Three thousand three hundred
and thirty three tangas.

783
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:08,120
Yes, one-third.
- One-third...

784
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,920
You guard him!
We're gonna dig up the money.

785
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:14,360
Oh, and my share?
- We'll split at equal shares.

786
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:08,800
Praise be to Allah, glory be
to Allah, praise be to Allah.

787
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,320
Praise be to Allah,
praise be to Allah!

788
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,360
Praise be to Allah!
- Hey, are you a man?

789
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,240
What's so surprising?
- Surprising?

790
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,680
Why are you sitting in the bag?
- I have to be in it.

791
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:31,040
Maybe you were put in the bag by
force? -Ha, ha, ha, ha, by force?

792
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:36,480
Would I have to pay six hundred
tangas to be put in the bag by force!

793
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,200
Six hundred tangas!

794
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,440
Why did you pay so much money?

795
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,320
This bag belongs to an Arab
and has a wonderful ability

796
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,520
to cure diseases and deformities.

797
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:57,240
I was lame, hunchbacked,
and crooked in one eye.

798
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:02,320
But I sat in the bag for two
hours, and my hunch was gone,

799
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:06,960
eye sight and leg straightened!
- Ah!

800
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,360
Why are you still sitting in the sack?
- Because I paid for the time!

801
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:15,920
I paid to be in it for exactly four
hours. I don't want to waste the time!

802
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:20,480
Listen, oh, you who
are sitting in the sack!

803
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:25,080
I'm also a hunchback,
lame and crooked in one eye.

804
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:28,760
And I gladly will pay
you three hundred tangas

805
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,640
to sit in the bag for
the remaining two hours.

806
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,800
All right! But you have
to pay me in advance!

807
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:40,400
I agree!
But let's not waste the time

808
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:43,520
which already belongs to me.

809
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:49,160
Phew! He lied to us
again, that rascal!

810
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:54,120
What should I do?

811
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,200
If three genies arrive
here and start to beat you,

812
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:01,120
to swear, and carry you around,

813
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,720
just say the magic spell:

814
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:08,440
"He who wears a copper
shield, he has a thick skull!

815
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,040
Kiss my donkey under its tail. "
- How, how?

816
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:13,640
Kiss my donkey under its tail!

817
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,320
<i>He who wears a copper
shield, he has a thick skull...

818
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,360
What?
<i>-Kiss my donkey under its tail!</i>

819
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,400
<i>He who wears a copper
shield, he has a thick skull.

820
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,080
<i>Kiss my donkey under its tail!

821
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,120
<i>He who wears a copper
shield, he has a thick skull...

822
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,080
<i>kiss my donkey under its tail.

823
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,320
Bring him!
Bring him quickly. You're late.

824
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:50,760
You lazy dogs! Well! Hurry!

825
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:53,520
Bring him! Bring him...

826
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,600
Why do they hesitate to sound it?

827
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,080
Nasreddin is no longer alive!

828
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:21,840
It is finished!

829
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,520
The troublemaker is dead!

830
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:33,120
We have lost our Nasreddin.

831
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,480
Nasreddin is dead.

832
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,720
Wai, Jae-harem!
Wai, Jae-harem!

833
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,240
Wai, Jae-harem!

834
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,480
Wai, Jae-harem!

835
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,960
Wai, Jae-harem!

836
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:13,400
How will we live without Nasreddin?

837
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,560
And how will I live
if Nasreddin dies?

838
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:19,960
Wai, Jae-harem!

839
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,720
Ae...!
- I...

840
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,320
Nasreddin?
- Nasreddin!

841
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,240
Nasreddin? -Nasreddin.
-Nasreddin! -Yep!

842
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:34,560
Nasreddin! Nasreddin!

843
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,777
Nasreddin! Nasreddin!

844
01:18:38,077 --> 01:18:40,584
Ali! Ali!

845
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,560
Wait, Ali!

846
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:50,400
Guljan! Guljan!
- Nasreddin!

847
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,640
Guljan!
- Nasreddin!

848
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:14,760
Don't bid farewell to us.
Don't bid farewell to us.

849
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:18,040
Oh, people of noble Bukhara!

850
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:23,320
Me and Guljan, we should leave
quietly. Because the guards may think

851
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:29,480
that all the people have decided to
leave Bukhara, and close the city gates.

852
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:36,320
Return to your homes!
And may you sleep in peace!

853
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,800
Let's never see the black
wings of trouble, again!

854
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:48,880
Nasreddin says goodbye
to you! For how long?

855
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,720
I don't know myself.

856
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:01,360

-THE END-
