2
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:17,021
You all right?

3
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:20,255
- Yep.
- How is boarding going?

4
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,493
- Better than home.
- Well,

5
00:02:23,526 --> 00:02:25,596
it's just for the weekend.

6
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,570
- So that's all for her?
- Yes.

7
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:37,539
That's, what,
a year's worth?

8
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:40,609
It's two, maybe three
weeks, at a guess.

9
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:42,943
<i>She drinks that much?</i>

10
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:45,477
She does.

11
00:02:47,014 --> 00:02:48,649
I thought you hated your mother.

12
00:02:48,682 --> 00:02:50,984
Hate's a strong word.

13
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:53,253
Where's she sleeping?

14
00:02:53,286 --> 00:02:58,821
She's bringing a nurse with
her. She has a broken leg.

15
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,959
Where's she sleeping?

16
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,261
The nurse is in the spare room.

17
00:03:02,294 --> 00:03:06,264
- So she's where Mum was?
- She will want the sun.

18
00:03:30,785 --> 00:03:34,753
Sam.

19
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:37,522
Sam, we're here.

20
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:45,665
Here. OK.

21
00:03:45,698 --> 00:03:48,098
Come on.

22
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:13,956
So two people are gonna
die in that room now?

23
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,825
No. She's not coming
here to die, Sam.

24
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:20,629
She's coming here to get
better and to meet you.

25
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:23,397
She'll go back eventually.

26
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,399
Her bell still works.

27
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:44,647
Ooh. You all right there? Ooh.

28
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:13,041
You sold the horses.

29
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:18,245
They've gone to someone who
can afford to look after them.

30
00:05:18,278 --> 00:05:19,279
What about Grace?

31
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:23,748
I'm not selling your mother's
horse, Sam.

32
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:26,252
She'll be lonely.

33
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:32,188
Well, we'll just have to give
her more attention then, eh?

34
00:06:48,591 --> 00:06:50,559
Dad!

35
00:07:09,242 --> 00:07:13,212
Dad!

36
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:54,779
- Samuel?
- Sam.

37
00:07:57,017 --> 00:07:59,550
Come closer.

38
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:09,427
- Turn around.
- What?

39
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,562
I want to take a look at you.

40
00:08:19,036 --> 00:08:21,736
Do the girls like you?

41
00:08:22,738 --> 00:08:25,172
Yeah.

42
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:31,711
Where is Sarah, my nurse?

43
00:08:31,947 --> 00:08:34,116
- Not sure.
- And Robert?

44
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,849
- Dunno.
- Fuck.

45
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,430
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to as
you to take me to the bathroom.

46
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,599
The bathroom?

47
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:55,568
You do have one?

48
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,037
Believe me, this is far
more humiliating for me

49
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,737
than it is for you.

50
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,910
Go on, then.

51
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:50,680
- What?
- Leave.

52
00:10:19,707 --> 00:10:23,409
- Blood of Christ.
- Body of Christ.

53
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,417
- Body of Christ.
- Blood of Christ.

54
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:37,187
- Body of Christ.
- Blood of Christ.

55
00:10:37,823 --> 00:10:40,691
Right.

56
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:02,042
What do you think
of New Zealand?

57
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:05,244
The 4ft I've seen seem nice.

58
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:11,219
And Sam?

59
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,654
Sam looks like his mother.

60
00:11:13,687 --> 00:11:14,789
Yes.

61
00:11:14,822 --> 00:11:17,124
I'm surprised you've
sent him away.

62
00:11:17,157 --> 00:11:19,627
You always said
it ruined your life.

63
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,426
Keeps him out of trouble.

64
00:11:25,631 --> 00:11:28,298
I need you to read this.

65
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:56,859
Hey!

66
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:57,993
Don't be a bitch
and cry about it.

67
00:11:58,026 --> 00:11:59,761
You missed a good party.

68
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:01,329
- Tracy Turnbull was there.
- Yeah, well,

69
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:05,700
- I'm not missing the next one.
- She has got the best tits!

70
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,567
This tastes like shit.

71
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,035
That's cos gin's not supposed
to be drunk straight;

72
00:12:08,068 --> 00:12:10,504
- it's for cocktails and mixes.
- So is your mum.

73
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:11,705
So,

74
00:12:11,738 --> 00:12:14,307
how much does an alcoholic
drink, anyway?

75
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,309
Two cases in two weeks.

76
00:12:16,342 --> 00:12:19,412
- That's like a bottle a day.
- That's impressive.

77
00:12:19,445 --> 00:12:21,947
Does she shit her pants?

78
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:24,816
- What?
- Nah, I'm serious.

79
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:28,851
You're a dick.

80
00:12:32,723 --> 00:12:37,324
A kid drowned there once.

81
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,294
How?

82
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:42,332
Put rocks in his backpack and
tried to swim across the river.

83
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:46,735
Really?

84
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:51,171
Man, why would you
do something like that?

85
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,107
Maybe he wanted to.

- (WHISTLE TRILLS, CROWD SHOUTS
- What are you doing, man?

109
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:04,109
If you miss any rubbish,
it'll be in your bed

110
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:06,776
when you get back.

111
00:14:12,249 --> 00:14:13,584
I won't be in England long.

112
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:15,820
Sarah will be here
the whole time.

113
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:18,888
I'm heading over to James'
for most of it anyway.

114
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,523
No, you aren't.

115
00:14:20,556 --> 00:14:21,891
- What?
- I want you here

116
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:23,393
with your Grandmother.

117
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:24,260
You don't wanna hang around her.

118
00:14:24,293 --> 00:14:27,229
- I don't have a choice.
- Really

119
00:14:27,262 --> 00:14:31,266
Sarah's gonna need your help.
I have to sort out Ruth's trust.

120
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:32,401
It's easier if I do
that in England.

121
00:14:32,434 --> 00:14:35,937
- She's<i> your</i> mother.
- Yes. I need to be there.

122
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,172
It has to be sorted now.

123
00:14:38,205 --> 00:14:40,341
I'm not looking after
that old bitch.

124
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:41,575
She is an old bitch,...

125
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:45,345
but you're gonna help look afte
her, whether you like it or not.

126
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:50,614
She's the one thing
stopping us from going broke.

127
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:56,088
If you're gonna drink my booze
which I assume you are -

128
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:58,456
stay away from my
whisky. All right?

129
00:14:58,489 --> 00:14:59,791
- Sure.
- And no parties.

130
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:01,493
- Sure.
- I mean it, Sam. No parties.

131
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,662
Not after last time.
I'll crucify you.

132
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,763
- All right.
- You'll be fine.

133
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:11,735
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

134
00:15:11,768 --> 00:15:14,201
Yeah.

135
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:26,179
Thank you.

136
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:35,221
Thank you for offering to help.

137
00:15:35,254 --> 00:15:37,755
I didn't.

138
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,726
Right.

139
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,195
Well, the main thing is her leg.

140
00:15:43,228 --> 00:15:46,265
The bones were completely
severed when she fell,

141
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:51,803
and her skin can't handle
the plaster, hence the splints.

142
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:54,238
I'll just need your help
with moving her, really -

143
00:15:54,271 --> 00:15:57,175
keeping her company,
giving me a break.

144
00:15:57,208 --> 00:16:02,176
Look, I'll help, but I don't
wanna talk to her.

145
00:16:02,412 --> 00:16:04,812
OK.

146
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:09,819
Hands here. OK?
Up here. That's it.

147
00:16:09,852 --> 00:16:13,822
And one, two, three, lift.

148
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:16,522
There you go. Good.

149
00:17:51,307 --> 00:17:54,476
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh. Not at all.

150
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,909
Um

151
00:18:03,483 --> 00:18:06,218
Ruth?

152
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:11,989
- This is Reverend Matthews.
- Good morning.

153
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:12,525
Is it?

154
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,961
I thought you might
like to talk.

155
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,829
Why did you think that?

156
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:24,269
Forgive me. How can I help you?

157
00:18:24,302 --> 00:18:28,339
Well, I'm here for you.
So we could just...

158
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:31,542
enjoy a cup of tea,
get to know each other.

159
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:33,677
I don't really do tea.

160
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:38,613
Or I could offer you communion
and absolution.

161
00:18:39,249 --> 00:18:40,783
How do you mean?

162
00:18:40,816 --> 00:18:45,054
Well, if you've got something o
your mind - regrets, perhaps -

163
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:48,690
then I can absolve you

164
00:18:48,723 --> 00:18:51,059
I don't have regrets.

165
00:18:51,092 --> 00:18:53,525
Right.

166
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:57,564
You should come
back another time.

167
00:18:57,597 --> 00:18:59,967
We can talk about a deal, maybe.

168
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,534
Excuse me?

169
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:03,736
I can make a donation to your
church. Which church is it?

170
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,305
- Anglican.
- Now, I'm not judgmental.

171
00:19:06,338 --> 00:19:09,575
I'm happy to work with
anyone for a clean slate.

172
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:13,378
- How much would it take?
- Ah.

173
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:15,480
500?

174
00:19:15,513 --> 00:19:18,047
A thousand?

175
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,951
A thousand it is.

176
00:19:20,984 --> 00:19:22,519
Look, no...

177
00:19:22,552 --> 00:19:25,055
You do deals with the devil,
Madam, not with God.

178
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:28,691
Oh, come on. A cheque
is a far more honest transaction

179
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:32,960
than listening to my
regrets and shame.

180
00:19:33,763 --> 00:19:35,330
Please take it.

181
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:38,734
You can't just buy your
way into heaven.

182
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,702
What can you offer me, then?

183
00:19:40,735 --> 00:19:44,436
Well, if you don't
have faith,...

184
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:46,974
then nothing.

185
00:19:47,007 --> 00:19:49,708
Well, then, fuck off.

186
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:52,412
Out!

187
00:19:54,447 --> 00:19:56,847
Out!

188
00:19:59,685 --> 00:20:01,387
You can't
speak to him like that.

189
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,089
I'll speak to
whom I like how I like!

190
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:05,890
You hit him!

191
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:08,293
- You're going to hell.
- I'm already there.

192
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:34,046
- Hello.
- Hey, Dad.

193
00:20:34,282 --> 00:20:37,685
Sam. Good to hear from you.

194
00:20:37,718 --> 00:20:40,087
Um, can you talk?

195
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,722
Yes.

196
00:20:41,755 --> 00:20:45,889
- Is everything all right?
- Yeah, uh,...

197
00:20:47,093 --> 00:20:49,929
- it's Mum's birthday.
- Yes.

198
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:50,930
I know.

199
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:55,434
- Are you going to visit her?
- I've got something planned.

200
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:58,034
That's great.

201
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,338
And Ruth?

202
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:00,905
How's she?

203
00:21:00,938 --> 00:21:03,240
I think she just assaulted
someone.

204
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:05,910
Sounds like everything's
normal, then.

205
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:11,545
- Yeah. Yeah, no, it's fine.
- I told you!

206
00:21:13,082 --> 00:21:15,884
Look, I'm...

207
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:17,720
I'm in the middle of something.

208
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,622
- Sure.
- I'm sorry. I need to go.

209
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:23,358
- OK.
- Is that OK?

210
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:26,925
- Bye.
- All right. All right, bye.

211
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:51,282
- Where are you going?
- Down the back of the farm.

212
00:21:51,315 --> 00:21:53,884
- I need you to stay with Ruth.
- I can't.

213
00:21:53,917 --> 00:21:55,619
- Yes, you can.
- I've got plans.

214
00:21:55,652 --> 00:22:00,822
Stop sulking and go look
after your grandmother.

215
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,141
She's gone off in
a huff, has she?

216
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:25,509
Something like that.

217
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,415
So,

218
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:31,081
what shall we do?

219
00:22:32,751 --> 00:22:33,552
What?

220
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:37,790
Perhaps you could show
me around the gardens.

221
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,425
- We could take a walk.
- A walk?

222
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:44,059
In my chair, you idiot.

223
00:22:44,361 --> 00:22:45,930
Or maybe you could read to me.

224
00:22:45,963 --> 00:22:49,466
I think I'll take a pass
on all of those options.

225
00:22:49,499 --> 00:22:50,634
Excuse me?

226
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:54,070
I'll bring you food,
I'll take you to the bathroom

227
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:57,606
until Sarah gets
back. But that's it.

228
00:22:57,639 --> 00:23:00,540
Please leave.

229
00:23:11,451 --> 00:23:13,320
Just testing.

230
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:16,120
- It works
- Mm.

231
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:26,562
- Yes?
- I need to go to the bathroom.

232
00:23:35,939 --> 00:23:38,974
Fight!

233
00:23:57,825 --> 00:24:00,559
Argh!

234
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:04,699
You win. Round two. Fight!

235
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:18,344
- I'm hungry.
- What would you like?

236
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:21,043
Anchoveta on toast.

237
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,435
You'll have to make
me some more.

238
00:24:47,468 --> 00:24:51,805
- Haven't you had enough?
- Oh, no, deary. Not nearly.

239
00:24:51,838 --> 00:24:54,706
Gin to here, water to here,

240
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:57,909
and a squeeze of lemon.

241
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,515
Gin to there, water to there?

242
00:25:02,548 --> 00:25:04,017
You heard.

243
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,486
So that's half gin
and half water?

244
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,152
Are you retarded?

245
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,093
Jesus.

246
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,703
Can you come here, please?

247
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:16,111
- Jesus!
- Don't ever water it down.

248
00:26:16,846 --> 00:26:19,780
Now go and make it properly.

249
00:26:56,231 --> 00:26:58,964
Shit.

250
00:26:59,467 --> 00:27:02,370
Give me my gin,

251
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:08,653
you little shit!

252
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:11,219
Don't you dare!

253
00:27:17,893 --> 00:27:21,097
Would you like another shot?

254
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,797
I would. Thank you.

255
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:27,266
Tell you what -

256
00:27:28,536 --> 00:27:31,103
I won't move.

257
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:43,649
Finished?

258
00:27:43,682 --> 00:27:47,551
Seems I have run
out of ammunition.

259
00:29:37,948 --> 00:29:40,516
Go away, girl.

260
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:46,587
Go away!

261
00:29:47,724 --> 00:29:50,160
Fuck off!

262
00:30:55,449 --> 00:30:58,584
Ruth.

263
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,197
What were you thinking?

264
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:09,632
Shut up and help me
up, you little fuckwit.

265
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:50,669
How is your leg?

266
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:53,270
Fine.

267
00:31:58,643 --> 00:32:01,210
Where's Sarah?

268
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:03,281
No idea.

269
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:04,615
She seemed upset.

270
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:08,118
- Maybe she won't come back.
- Oh, she'll come back.

271
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:10,919
She wants to save my soul.

272
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:12,755
Fat chance.

273
00:32:12,788 --> 00:32:17,260
Sam, you are a bloody
shit. A bloody little shit.

274
00:32:17,293 --> 00:32:19,826
So are you.

275
00:32:20,628 --> 00:32:23,462
At least you're a fighter.

276
00:32:28,235 --> 00:32:30,771
I'll go see where Sarah is.

277
00:32:30,804 --> 00:32:34,506
Stay. Please have
a drink with me.

278
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:58,062
Why did you come here?

279
00:32:58,095 --> 00:33:02,866
Can we not have
some small talk first?

280
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:05,135
Sure.

281
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:10,406
- Why did you come here?
- Oh, Christ's sake.

282
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:13,209
I needed a
I needed a holiday.

283
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:17,245
You have a broken leg,
and you and Dad hate each other.

284
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:19,979
No. I don't hate him.

285
00:33:20,348 --> 00:33:23,116
I sent him away to boarding
school from the age of 5,

286
00:33:23,149 --> 00:33:25,919
and I never told him
who his father was,

287
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:29,020
but I don't hate your father.

288
00:33:34,326 --> 00:33:37,793
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

289
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:44,169
I want one more passionate
love affair.

290
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:47,571
Well, that's gonna be hard,

291
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:49,073
considering your
current situation.

292
00:33:49,106 --> 00:33:51,740
You have no idea.

293
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:54,510
Now finish your drink.

294
00:33:54,543 --> 00:33:57,547
- No. I'm not thirsty.
- Oh, come on.

295
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,948
We're not gonna have
a decent conversation

296
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:04,517
if we don't get drunk. Give it
to me. I'll show you how.

297
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:17,528
Ah. See?

298
00:34:34,045 --> 00:34:36,447
Happy?

299
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,682
Can you do it again?

300
00:34:48,857 --> 00:34:51,958
Enough.

301
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:16,013
I don't like this room much.

302
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:22,719
Must be rather painful
having me occupy it.

303
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:27,789
It is.

304
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:31,393
I'm sorry.

305
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:09,929
You didn't try to drink
with her, did you?

306
00:36:09,962 --> 00:36:10,763
I did.

307
00:36:10,796 --> 00:36:14,165
Well,
you're an idiot, then.

308
00:36:17,502 --> 00:36:18,636
How does she do it?

309
00:36:18,669 --> 00:36:22,106
She has the constitution
of a goat.

310
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,040
Is she all right?

311
00:36:23,073 --> 00:36:27,410
I'm gonna take her into the
hospital later for a check-up.

312
00:36:27,443 --> 00:36:29,879
I need your help.

313
00:36:29,912 --> 00:36:32,780
- Uh-
- I wasn't asking.

314
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:36,082
- Sure.
- Let me, um

315
00:36:36,718 --> 00:36:39,585
Let me look at that for you.

316
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:51,862
Relax, please.

317
00:37:03,074 --> 00:37:04,443
Is she always like this?

318
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:07,412
I think it's got worse
since she hurt her leg.

319
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:10,715
- But you left me with her.
- Yes. Well,...

320
00:37:10,748 --> 00:37:15,550
sometimes there's only
so much one can take.

321
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:22,191
She really drunk you under
the table, didn't she?

322
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:24,991
It's the gin. It's awful.

323
00:37:27,196 --> 00:37:29,898
Why did you come here with her?

324
00:37:29,931 --> 00:37:32,598
I don't really know.

325
00:37:35,369 --> 00:37:35,937
What's all this?

326
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:39,206
I've been putting these
together for her.

327
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:41,940
She hates me doing it.

328
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:44,477
She looks like she's
had a lot of fun.

329
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:48,014
That's one way of putting
it. She was really there,

330
00:37:48,047 --> 00:37:50,116
on the front lines,
taking photos.

331
00:37:50,149 --> 00:37:52,051
- Really?
- Can you imagine?

332
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:53,819
Coming!

333
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:55,754
- She's up?
- She's always up early.

334
00:37:55,787 --> 00:37:59,155
I said I'm coming.

335
00:38:52,537 --> 00:38:55,570
Most people like sunsets.

336
00:38:56,306 --> 00:38:58,973
I love the sunrise.

337
00:38:59,876 --> 00:39:02,245
- Yeah, it's nice.
- Nice?

338
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:04,978
Please read some more.

339
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,216
This light allows
the imagination in.

340
00:39:09,418 --> 00:39:12,687
Even these unkempt gardens
hold some magic.

341
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:17,889
One more hour, and they're
just overrun and crap.

342
00:39:19,526 --> 00:39:22,093
Those photos.

343
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:22,863
You took them?

344
00:39:22,896 --> 00:39:26,232
Your father hasn't told you
much about me, has he?

345
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:31,037
He said you were a photographer
and that you went to war.

346
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,937
- I did.
- Which ones?

347
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:37,006
Most of them, I suppose.

348
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:42,413
Thank you, Sarah.

349
00:39:42,446 --> 00:39:45,349
I love the
games we humans play.

350
00:39:45,382 --> 00:39:46,851
- Games?
- Each morning,

351
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,518
she brings me a cup
of tea, in the hope

352
00:39:48,551 --> 00:39:53,921
that I will reach for it
before I reach for my usual.

353
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:57,760
- And you don't go for it?
- Of course not.

354
00:39:57,793 --> 00:40:00,296
But I pretend to be grateful.

355
00:40:00,329 --> 00:40:03,729
- Why?
- That's the game we play.

356
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:13,371
Are we gonna play games?

357
00:40:15,976 --> 00:40:18,676
Well, then. We shan't.

358
00:40:20,846 --> 00:40:24,250
Perhaps you can get some of you
friends over to sort out this

359
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:25,785
mess.

360
00:40:25,818 --> 00:40:27,752
No, I don't think my friends

361
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,821
are gonna wanna clean up
these gardens.

362
00:40:29,854 --> 00:40:32,691
- Why not?
- Cos we're all drunken louts.

363
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:37,325
You sound
like my kind of people.

364
00:41:28,272 --> 00:41:31,908
- Can you knock!?
- Sorry.

365
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:33,910
What do you want?

366
00:41:33,943 --> 00:41:38,214
She asked me to get some
new clothes for you.

367
00:41:38,247 --> 00:41:42,318
- Why?
- She said you dress like shit.

368
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,133
Come in.

369
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:02,135
- Hmm.

370
00:42:02,168 --> 00:42:04,170
- Turn around.
- I'm not turning around.

371
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:08,938
Shut up, turn around,
and tuck yourself in.

372
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:18,416
Women appreciate a man who
takes pride in his appearance.

373
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:20,751
How do you feel?

374
00:42:20,784 --> 00:42:25,588
- I feel like a dick.
- Well, you don't look like one.

375
00:42:25,621 --> 00:42:30,457
No. I... I think it could
improve your sex life.

376
00:42:32,461 --> 00:42:36,098
- What do you mean by that?
- What do you think I mean?

377
00:42:36,131 --> 00:42:38,232
- Well, I'm not-
- Of course not.

378
00:42:38,265 --> 00:42:40,735
You just haven't had sex yet.

379
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:44,439
- I'm not a virgin!
- I never said you were.

380
00:42:44,472 --> 00:42:47,038
Hello, Sarah.

381
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:49,810
What do you think?

382
00:42:49,843 --> 00:42:51,344
- Oh.

383
00:42:51,377 --> 00:42:55,178
Very handsome.

384
00:43:12,529 --> 00:43:15,933
- (SEATBELT CLICKS, KEYS JANGLE
- What are you doing?

385
00:43:15,966 --> 00:43:19,769
- Taking you to the doctor.
- Where are your flannels?

386
00:43:19,802 --> 00:43:20,570
Excuse me?

387
00:43:20,603 --> 00:43:24,407
We're not leaving until you
have your flannels on.

388
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:31,377
Well, I guess we're
going anywhere, then.

389
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:05,542
There's a little healing
going on, but not much.

390
00:44:05,575 --> 00:44:10,077
- What do you mean?
- Things are going slowly.

391
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:13,549
Could I walk again?

392
00:44:13,582 --> 00:44:16,218
Not like you used to.

393
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:18,820
Is there anything else?

394
00:44:18,853 --> 00:44:22,056
Perhaps we should think
about putting in a catheter.

395
00:44:22,089 --> 00:44:25,193
It will limit your trips to the
bathroom and take away any

396
00:44:25,226 --> 00:44:30,929
unnecessary movement from
the leg. That could help.

397
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,132
- Sarah?
- It might be a good idea.

398
00:44:43,575 --> 00:44:47,343
What happens if I
meet someone,...

399
00:44:49,247 --> 00:44:51,947
we have a few drinks.

400
00:44:52,416 --> 00:44:54,985
Do I have to spell it out?

401
00:44:55,018 --> 00:45:00,254
You will have to abstain
from sexual intercourse.

402
00:45:00,456 --> 00:45:02,857
Mm.

403
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:06,926
Listen to me very carefully.

404
00:45:07,596 --> 00:45:09,665
I will walk again,...

405
00:45:09,698 --> 00:45:14,066
and I will never have
a fucking catheter!

406
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:17,672
OK.

407
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,028
- What was it like?
- What was what like?

408
00:45:47,631 --> 00:45:50,031
War.

409
00:45:54,169 --> 00:45:57,137
War is It's simply a waste.

410
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,973
A senseless bloody waste.

411
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:07,279
Some boys like you get to live.

412
00:46:08,649 --> 00:46:11,216
Others don't.

413
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,588
Tell you what -
I think we should have a party.

414
00:46:15,621 --> 00:46:17,457
- That sounds like fun.
- Mm.

415
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,693
- With who?
- Your drunken louts.

416
00:46:20,726 --> 00:46:21,160
Ah, no.

417
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:22,261
I don't think that's
a good idea.

418
00:46:22,294 --> 00:46:25,397
- Why not?
- The place will get smashed.

419
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,998
Dad'll kill me.

420
00:46:26,031 --> 00:46:27,666
Well, your dad has always
had a stick up his bum.

421
00:46:27,699 --> 00:46:29,735
Why doesn't he want
you to have fun?

422
00:46:29,768 --> 00:46:31,569
Mm. Ruth!

423
00:46:31,602 --> 00:46:34,405
I did something dumb last time.

424
00:46:34,438 --> 00:46:36,774
What did you do?

425
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:40,975
- It doesn't matter.
- Go on. Spit it out.

426
00:46:46,615 --> 00:46:49,182
Mum was sick.

427
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:55,020
Dad wanted to cheer me up.

428
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:58,691
So we threw a party.

429
00:46:59,293 --> 00:47:02,229
And I got drunk and
decided I wanted to...

430
00:47:02,262 --> 00:47:06,631
drive to the hospital
at 3 in the morning.

431
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:13,337
But I crashed,...

432
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:15,641
badly. I

433
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:17,609
totalled Dad's car.

434
00:47:17,642 --> 00:47:20,178
- You were OK?
- Yeah.

435
00:47:20,211 --> 00:47:25,816
But then one of my friends brok
a tap and flooded the house.

436
00:47:25,849 --> 00:47:28,383
It was carnage.

437
00:47:29,753 --> 00:47:34,357
Perhaps I want some carnage
right now.

438
00:48:35,843 --> 00:48:38,411
Hello?

439
00:48:38,913 --> 00:48:41,082
Hello?

440
00:48:41,115 --> 00:48:43,782
Hi. Is Robert there?

441
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:47,085
Is that you, Steven?

442
00:48:48,388 --> 00:48:50,690
- Steven?
- Yes.

443
00:48:50,723 --> 00:48:54,491
Darling,
it's your lawyer.

444
00:48:56,028 --> 00:48:58,594
Hello, Steve?

445
00:49:00,398 --> 00:49:03,099
- Hi, Dad.
- Sam.

446
00:49:04,335 --> 00:49:06,203
'Darling?'

447
00:49:06,236 --> 00:49:08,572
- Who's that?
- She's a friend.

448
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:11,440
- Really?
- Yes.

449
00:49:13,543 --> 00:49:15,745
- I hope you're having fun,...
- Sam.

450
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:19,349
...while I look after
your mother.

451
00:49:19,382 --> 00:49:21,517
It must be 3 in the morning.

452
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,353
Do you<i> want</i> to talk
about this now?

453
00:49:26,321 --> 00:49:28,456
- No. Not really.
- I'll be home soon.

454
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:32,527
I'm almost done here.
I loved your mother, Sam.

455
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,260
I miss her every day.

456
00:49:35,962 --> 00:49:37,664
Sure.

457
00:49:37,697 --> 00:49:38,899
- Sam.
- Anyways,

458
00:49:38,932 --> 00:49:42,669
I was just ringing to say
that we're having a party.

459
00:49:42,702 --> 00:49:45,435
Sam-

460
00:49:51,209 --> 00:49:53,812
All right!

461
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:59,416
So, write down your order,
in terms of alcohol,

462
00:49:59,449 --> 00:50:01,018
and Sarah will
go out and buy it.

463
00:50:01,051 --> 00:50:02,753
- I will?
- In return,

464
00:50:02,786 --> 00:50:05,189
I want you to clean
up these gardens.

465
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:07,256
As you can see,
they're a disgrace.

466
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:09,625
It's a lot of work,

467
00:50:09,658 --> 00:50:10,726
- Miss.
- Yes.

468
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:12,628
So, how much
booze are we talking?

469
00:50:12,661 --> 00:50:15,361
How much do you want?

470
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:17,833
- Three kegs?
- Deal.

471
00:50:17,866 --> 00:50:20,402
Really?

472
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,736
But no fucking about.

473
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,773
I'm expecting a proper
job from you,

474
00:50:25,806 --> 00:50:28,473
or you get nothing.

475
00:50:29,775 --> 00:50:31,878
- Oh yeah.
- Choice.

476
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,577
It's cheaper than
a gardener, I suppose.

477
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,980
I'm enjoying the view.

478
00:51:12,013 --> 00:51:14,680
You're such a tart.

479
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:07,395
Oh, shot!

480
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:09,597
Whoo-hoo!

481
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:12,732
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Yeah, bro.

482
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:19,205
It always surprises me that
your father came here.

483
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:21,938
This was Mum's dream.

484
00:52:22,908 --> 00:52:24,944
And he wanted to
get away from me.

485
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:30,479
Why didn't you tell him
who his father was?

486
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,984
I wasn't ready.

487
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:35,650
And when I was,...

488
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,486
he wasn't interested.

489
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,855
- Who was he?
- Some fool.

490
00:52:49,664 --> 00:52:51,800
Have you ever been
up here at sunrise?

491
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:55,003
Once. Mum and I brought
our sleeping bags up,

492
00:52:55,036 --> 00:52:56,370
and we slept under the stars.

493
00:52:56,403 --> 00:52:59,340
I'd like to do that once
before I head back.

494
00:52:59,373 --> 00:53:00,574
Is that right?

495
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:01,609
You don't think
I could handle it?

496
00:53:01,642 --> 00:53:03,844
Oh, I never said that.

497
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:05,578
What?!

498
00:53:05,611 --> 00:53:07,547
Hey, don't point that shit
at me, man - seriously.

499
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,581
Oh, it's not loaded, you pussy.

500
00:53:08,614 --> 00:53:09,515
Fuck off.

501
00:53:09,548 --> 00:53:12,017
Seeing someone
shot is not pleasant.

502
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,586
I've seen boys younger
than you with their brains

503
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:18,757
decorating their
best friends' chests.

504
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:21,592
Now, hand it over, and
I'll show you how to use it.

505
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,894
- Go on, then.
- Mm.

506
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:29,730
OK.

507
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,103
This is gonna be interesting.

508
00:53:33,136 --> 00:53:34,738
Pull!

509
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:37,039
Oh shit!

510
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:39,839
Again!

511
00:53:44,745 --> 00:53:47,746
Cheers.

512
00:54:02,194 --> 00:54:04,928
- Is that her?
- Yeah.

513
00:54:06,197 --> 00:54:07,999
She was hot. I would definitely-

514
00:54:08,032 --> 00:54:11,503
You're talking about my grandma.

515
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:13,871
Right. Sorry.

516
00:54:13,904 --> 00:54:15,806
- Holy shit.
- What?

517
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:16,573
Females are arriving,

518
00:54:16,606 --> 00:54:18,275
and there's some pretty
good-looking ones too!

519
00:54:18,308 --> 00:54:21,508
Bullshit. Really?

520
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:24,345
Sorry. Excuse me.

521
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:34,256
Oh, guess the word got around

522
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,697
- Hey. Um...
- Hi. Where are you from?

523
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:25,834
You're not from around here.

524
00:55:38,512 --> 00:55:41,078
Oh, it's you.

525
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:43,583
Are we making too much
noise or something?

526
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:45,485
Oh, wouldn't that
make me a cliché?

527
00:55:45,518 --> 00:55:50,088
Old woman who wants peace
and quiet.

528
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:53,156
So what's the problem, then?

529
00:55:53,291 --> 00:55:54,859
There's no problem.

530
00:55:54,892 --> 00:55:57,361
- You said you wanted carnage.
- I did.

531
00:55:57,394 --> 00:55:59,997
But a little bit of
sophistication wouldn't hurt.

532
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,765
Oh, we don't do
sophisticated carnage.

533
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:05,568
Obviously not. Look.
Why don't you just go outside,

534
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:08,705
find a girl, seduce her?
You're not gonna get laid

535
00:56:08,738 --> 00:56:12,739
wheeling an old woman
around a party.

536
00:56:12,908 --> 00:56:15,942
Are you afraid of something?

537
00:56:16,978 --> 00:56:18,946
What? No.

538
00:56:18,979 --> 00:56:21,949
Do you not wanna
be seen with me?

539
00:56:21,982 --> 00:56:25,082
- No.
- Good!

540
00:56:29,956 --> 00:56:32,159
Uh-oh. LAUGHS: You are a shit.

541
00:56:32,192 --> 00:56:34,927
Don't you

542
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:51,074
- Hello, love.
- Hello, handsome.

543
00:56:51,107 --> 00:56:53,844
- Don't be a hold-out.
- Eh?

544
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:54,611
Offer her some smoke.

545
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:57,945
It isn't polite to
bogart a joint.

546
00:56:58,013 --> 00:57:00,049
Do you want some?

547
00:57:12,493 --> 00:57:14,628
I've had better.

548
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:16,964
- Sarah?
- Absolutely not.

549
00:58:09,142 --> 00:58:11,345
- Hey.
- Hey.

550
00:58:11,378 --> 00:58:12,946
You having fun?

551
00:58:12,979 --> 00:58:15,381
Yep.

552
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,737
Can you scratch her eyes out?

553
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:43,206
I'm not doing your dirty work.

554
00:58:48,543 --> 00:58:51,077
Shall we dance?

555
00:58:51,212 --> 00:58:54,713
- You could drop me.
- No, I won't.

556
00:58:55,149 --> 00:58:58,953
You better not.

557
01:00:30,432 --> 01:00:32,667
I can take it from here.

558
01:01:23,178 --> 01:01:25,712
Ruth.

559
01:01:31,018 --> 01:01:33,452
Ruth.

560
01:01:36,322 --> 01:01:38,491
Ruth.

561
01:01:38,524 --> 01:01:41,960
We'll see you at the hospital.

562
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:44,394
OK.

563
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:19,194
Um,

564
01:02:19,227 --> 01:02:24,262
I'll have the pathology
results tomorrow. OK?

565
01:03:59,881 --> 01:04:02,981
Thanks.

566
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,442
I need a cup of coffee.
Do you want one?

567
01:04:32,475 --> 01:04:35,276
- No, thank you.
- Sam?

568
01:04:35,678 --> 01:04:38,346
I'm fine. Thank you.

569
01:04:50,791 --> 01:04:53,325
How are you?

570
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,464
- I'm all right.
- I should have been here.

571
01:04:57,497 --> 01:05:00,367
We were
fine without you.

572
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:03,433
Oh yes. Well, obviously not.

573
01:05:18,982 --> 01:05:21,650
How are you feeling?

574
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,487
I'm all right.

575
01:05:25,555 --> 01:05:28,222
I shouldn't be here.

576
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:29,926
It's up to you and Dad, I guess.

577
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,526
It's up to me.

578
01:05:34,696 --> 01:05:37,363
Uh, I got you a present.

579
01:05:42,269 --> 01:05:44,937
Don't go overboard.

580
01:05:59,851 --> 01:06:03,253
The taint of rubber...

581
01:06:04,022 --> 01:06:06,722
adds a certain charm.

582
01:06:10,394 --> 01:06:13,530
You said you didn't
wanna play games.

583
01:06:13,563 --> 01:06:15,964
I don't.

584
01:06:18,034 --> 01:06:20,600
Are you dying?

585
01:06:22,037 --> 01:06:24,438
Well,...

586
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:27,140
we're all dying.

587
01:06:27,676 --> 01:06:30,242
I wanna know.

588
01:06:32,714 --> 01:06:35,114
Yes.

589
01:06:38,885 --> 01:06:44,455
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Would you have spoken to me,

590
01:06:44,623 --> 01:06:47,157
if you knew?

591
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:54,197
Can I ask you a question?

592
01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:03,338
When you crashed your
dad's car at the party,

593
01:07:04,341 --> 01:07:07,641
- did you do it on purpose?
- What?

594
01:07:07,777 --> 01:07:10,344
You heard me.

595
01:07:55,819 --> 01:07:58,655
The hospital just called to
say they're moving Ruth

596
01:07:58,688 --> 01:08:01,221
to the hospice.

597
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:06,262
Can you stop by and see her
on your way back to school?

598
01:08:06,295 --> 01:08:08,728
Nope.

599
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,969
I'm worried he's gonna
try and keep her there.

600
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:14,736
Aren't you her nurse?

601
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:18,105
Your father's not interested
in what I think any more.

602
01:08:18,138 --> 01:08:21,175
- Well, he's in charge.
- She doesn't want to die alone.

603
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,444
- That's why she came here.
- Really?

604
01:08:23,477 --> 01:08:25,979
Doesn't she have
friends back home?

605
01:08:26,012 --> 01:08:28,848
- Not really.
- Well, that's not surprising.

606
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:33,516
- She's afraid.
- Well, that's<i> her</i> problem.

607
01:08:51,067 --> 01:08:54,102
Mum didn't wanna be alone.

608
01:08:58,006 --> 01:09:02,708
She wanted me to be with
her when she died,...

609
01:09:03,344 --> 01:09:06,278
hold her hand as she passed.

610
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:11,816
And I promised her I would.

611
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,756
And then she started to go, and

612
01:09:15,789 --> 01:09:19,492
it looked like she
was in pain,...

613
01:09:19,525 --> 01:09:23,760
started making all
these funny sounds.

614
01:09:25,463 --> 01:09:28,131
I couldn't bear it.

615
01:09:31,035 --> 01:09:33,337
I was scared, afraid,

616
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,840
so I left.

617
01:09:35,873 --> 01:09:38,540
And she died without me.

618
01:09:40,711 --> 01:09:42,378
I'm a coward.

619
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:47,581
- You're not a coward.
- I got stoned at her funeral.

620
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:52,285
I haven't been to
her grave since.

621
01:10:00,361 --> 01:10:02,730
I didn't know she was
dying until she got here.

622
01:10:02,763 --> 01:10:05,465
- Right.
- That's why I had to go back.

623
01:10:05,498 --> 01:10:07,834
I should never have
allowed her into our lives.

624
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:11,004
I made a mistake, and I'm sorry.

625
01:10:11,671 --> 01:10:14,273
The doctors want her to stay
in the hospital. I agree.

626
01:10:14,306 --> 01:10:17,510
It's for the best. She won't
come back home, OK?

627
01:10:17,543 --> 01:10:20,209
I really don't care.

628
01:10:26,817 --> 01:10:28,418
Sam!

629
01:11:01,247 --> 01:11:04,417
Away, old man;
give me thy hand; away!

630
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:07,553
King Lear hath lost,
he and his daughter taken.

631
01:11:07,586 --> 01:11:10,353
A man may rot, even here.

632
01:11:15,392 --> 01:11:18,062
Men must endure
their going hence,

633
01:11:18,095 --> 01:11:20,565
even as their coming hither.

634
01:11:21,864 --> 01:11:24,267
Ripeness is all. Come on.

635
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,968
And that's true too.

636
01:11:28,705 --> 01:11:31,240
Mr Stevenson?

637
01:12:08,972 --> 01:12:10,808
Dude.

638
01:12:12,943 --> 01:12:15,643
Stevenson. Stevenson!

639
01:12:15,778 --> 01:12:19,382
What are you doing?
Stop. Stop it!

640
01:12:19,415 --> 01:12:21,918
Stop it! Stop it!

641
01:12:21,951 --> 01:12:23,752
Awesome!

642
01:12:23,785 --> 01:12:28,156
You're expelled, Stevenson.
You hear me?

643
01:12:28,189 --> 01:12:30,058
You're gone!

644
01:13:01,918 --> 01:13:04,421
Aren't you supposed
to be at school?

645
01:13:04,454 --> 01:13:06,490
I got expelled.

646
01:13:06,523 --> 01:13:10,490
I'm proud of you.

647
01:13:10,993 --> 01:13:13,796
All the best people
get expelled.

648
01:13:13,829 --> 01:13:15,631
I was expelled, you know.

649
01:13:15,664 --> 01:13:18,631
- I'm sure you were.
- Twice.

650
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:23,602
Let's go back home.

651
01:13:59,836 --> 01:14:02,272
Goodnight.

652
01:14:02,305 --> 01:14:04,206
Goodnight.

653
01:14:21,488 --> 01:14:23,457
Yes.

654
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:27,360
Can you not see it
from his perspective?

655
01:14:27,393 --> 01:14:30,863
He's been through
a lot. I thought

656
01:14:30,896 --> 01:14:32,565
Yeah. But perhap...

657
01:14:32,598 --> 01:14:38,169
Yes, I understand that rules
are important - it's just

658
01:14:38,202 --> 01:14:40,736
Well

659
01:14:41,239 --> 01:14:44,141
Thank you.

660
01:14:44,174 --> 01:14:46,741
Fucking idiot.

661
01:14:48,779 --> 01:14:51,013
She has to go back.

662
01:14:51,046 --> 01:14:52,615
That would be a shame.

663
01:14:52,648 --> 01:14:56,219
You've thrown away
your education.

664
01:14:56,252 --> 01:14:58,751
For what?

665
01:14:59,687 --> 01:15:03,225
I'm asking you a question.
What were you thinking?

666
01:15:03,258 --> 01:15:05,260
What were<i> you</i> thinking?

667
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:07,061
Sending me to boarding school?

668
01:15:07,094 --> 01:15:09,330
- Is that what this is about?
- Two months after mum died.

669
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:12,600
Sam, we spoke about
this. It was for the best.

670
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,702
Was it for the best to leave me
alone and go shag your new

671
01:15:15,735 --> 01:15:18,436
girlfriend in England?

672
01:15:20,173 --> 01:15:23,642
I have never betrayed
your mother.

673
01:15:23,675 --> 01:15:26,979
If you care so much about her,
why haven't you been to see her?

674
01:15:27,012 --> 01:15:32,915
Not having a father doesn't mea
you can be a shit one to me!

675
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:39,728
I thought you would be better
off without me, Sam.

676
01:17:39,761 --> 01:17:42,260
I'm sorry.

677
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:25,966
They're deciding my fate.

678
01:18:26,734 --> 01:18:29,771
We don't need to do any more
tests - you can tell by the lack

679
01:18:29,804 --> 01:18:32,340
of urine that her
kidneys are failing.

680
01:18:32,373 --> 01:18:34,207
What can we expect?

681
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,876
She'll start to feel more pain,

682
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:39,179
and gradually,
her lungs will fill with fluid.

683
01:18:39,212 --> 01:18:41,881
Her breaths will become
longer, and...

684
01:18:41,914 --> 01:18:45,017
she'll die. She should
be in the hospice.

685
01:18:45,050 --> 01:18:47,718
She's staying here.

686
01:18:48,587 --> 01:18:50,989
She has a nurse.

687
01:18:51,022 --> 01:18:53,592
She's staying here.

688
01:18:53,625 --> 01:18:55,460
OK.

689
01:18:55,493 --> 01:18:58,529
I'll leave you something
for the pain.

690
01:18:58,562 --> 01:19:01,062
Thank you.

691
01:19:02,232 --> 01:19:04,068
Sam, take my shoes off.

692
01:19:04,101 --> 01:19:08,135
I want to feel the grass
under my feet.

693
01:19:09,205 --> 01:19:11,905
Can you help me stand?

694
01:19:12,608 --> 01:19:15,008
Please.

695
01:19:45,636 --> 01:19:48,206
Oh, it's good.

696
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:51,939
Just let me go.

697
01:20:04,153 --> 01:20:07,853
I definitely won't
be going home.

698
01:20:07,922 --> 01:20:12,692
Well, England's crap anyway.

699
01:20:16,863 --> 01:20:19,397
I love you, Sam.

700
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:26,606
I wish you didn't.

701
01:20:26,639 --> 01:20:29,206
But it's true.

702
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:35,781
Sam.

703
01:20:35,814 --> 01:20:40,415
There's one last thing
I need your help with.

704
01:20:41,819 --> 01:20:44,319
Anything.

705
01:20:59,468 --> 01:21:02,134
I'm doing this for you.

706
01:21:02,269 --> 01:21:07,041
Through the suffering, death an
resurrection of Jesus Christ,

707
01:21:07,074 --> 01:21:12,009
may almighty God free
you from all punishment.

708
01:21:12,112 --> 01:21:14,779
The body of Christ.

709
01:21:38,301 --> 01:21:40,536
I've still got it.

710
01:21:40,569 --> 01:21:43,237
Yes. Yes, you have.

711
01:23:24,493 --> 01:23:27,027
Ruth?

712
01:23:30,565 --> 01:23:33,099
Ruth?

713
01:23:40,207 --> 01:23:44,942
Is it time
for our little outing?

714
01:23:47,113 --> 01:23:49,647
Yeah.

715
01:27:56,530 --> 01:27:59,566
I never thanked you for
cleaning up the garden.

716
01:27:59,599 --> 01:28:02,069
Well, she bribed
us with alcohol.

717
01:28:02,102 --> 01:28:04,635
Oh. You know,...

718
01:28:05,839 --> 01:28:08,805
she threw a knife at me once.

719
01:28:09,641 --> 01:28:12,344
- Really?
- She was drunk.

720
01:28:12,377 --> 01:28:15,880
Missed my head by an inch and
stuck in a knot of wood in the

721
01:28:15,913 --> 01:28:18,149
door.

722
01:28:18,182 --> 01:28:22,350
I was just trying to
get her attention.

723
01:28:23,253 --> 01:28:25,389
- She threw a cup at me.
- And?

724
01:28:25,422 --> 01:28:27,791
- And she didn't miss.
- Well, you probably knew her

725
01:28:27,824 --> 01:28:31,525
better than me.

726
01:28:36,365 --> 01:28:41,400
She never told me
who my father was.

727
01:28:47,708 --> 01:28:50,375
I don't think she knew.

728
01:28:52,812 --> 01:28:55,479
That sounds about right.

729
01:29:06,725 --> 01:29:10,628
If you've got something
you wanna say to her,...

730
01:29:10,661 --> 01:29:14,663
now is pretty much
your last chance.

731
01:29:15,732 --> 01:29:18,401
I mean, she's not gonna
argue back now.

732
01:29:23,939 --> 01:29:27,076
You're like your mother, Sam.

733
01:29:27,109 --> 01:29:29,776
She was the strong one.

734
01:29:30,712 --> 01:29:33,279
The kind one.

735
01:31:48,627 --> 01:31:53,626
