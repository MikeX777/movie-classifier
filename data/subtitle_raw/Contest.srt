Come in, please.

185

Oh, sorry.
I didn't realize

in the meeting.

187
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:00,870
Uh, Coach Nadley called,
and I reconfirmed

the board for 11:00.

Sorry to bother you.

193
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,850
I'll reduce
your suspension...

to a one-month
period if you'll--

195

Are you out--

Come on.
It's just coffee.

Isn't that the kid
whose grandma runs

he gets his own show

You volunteer
to do this,

You just have to appear
to be helping.

241

Once he says yes,
then we'll work

that it won't

in this for you?
