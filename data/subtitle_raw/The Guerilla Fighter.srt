00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:51,159
Hello

17

Hello

18
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:53,962
Hello

Hello

20
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,038
Hello

21
00:06:04,308 --> 00:06:05,206
Hello

22
00:06:05,776 --> 00:06:06,572
...I'm saying

23
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:07,973
Yeah, Nikhil...

24
00:06:08,913 --> 00:06:12,178
one of our boys is an important comrade

25
00:06:12,783 --> 00:06:16,480
arrangements are to be made for his stay:
a shelter

26
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:18,880
I believe staying at your place is best.

27
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:20,724
Yes.

28
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,392
It is not very safe where he is now...

29
00:07:08,173 --> 00:07:08,798
May I come in?...

30
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:10,408
Who?...

31
00:07:10,743 --> 00:07:11,539
Come... come

32
00:07:13,145 --> 00:07:14,578
Got slightly delayed with serving your tea...

33
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:16,074
Your clock isn't working.

34
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,212
Isn't it?

35
00:07:22,988 --> 00:07:24,506
Yes, it's running.

36
00:07:25,007 --> 00:07:25,924
What?

37
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:26,721
It's running...

38
00:07:28,193 --> 00:07:29,057
Meaning?

39
00:07:29,495 --> 00:07:31,395
It runs while flat and doesn't when it's
standing.

40
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:32,556
Then how do I see the time?

41
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:33,424
Like this.

42
00:07:35,367 --> 00:07:36,197
Funny.

43
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,235
For me... it's not working even lying flat

44
00:07:43,676 --> 00:07:45,166
The tea is slightly strong today
isn't it...

45
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:46,111
No... I prefer strong tea...

46
00:07:46,812 --> 00:07:48,404
Everybody in our house prefers strong tea...

47
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:50,615
Let me arrange this...

48
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:51,850
Yeah.

49
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,610
Biman will come tomorrow very early in the
morning

50
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:56,046
and will take you somewhere else...

51
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,751
Well, don't feel bad...

52
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:04,162
Today here... tomorrow there... Nothing
fixed...

53
00:08:05,464 --> 00:08:07,159
Your mother doesn't like it at all

54
00:08:08,434 --> 00:08:10,664
I know... surely she asks you to come home

55
00:08:11,337 --> 00:08:12,037
Doesn't she?

56
00:08:15,774 --> 00:08:17,571
Have you a sister or a brother?

57
00:08:18,944 --> 00:08:21,504
You know, something terrible happened
in my school...

58
00:08:23,115 --> 00:08:25,481
Oh I forgot to wash your shirt...

59
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,750
let me wash it now,
it'll be dry by tonight...

60
00:08:32,026 --> 00:08:32,726
Ready.

61
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:33,817
I'm waiting for you...

62
00:08:34,662 --> 00:08:35,321
Would you go wearing this shirt?

63
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,991
What's wrong?
- Are you going for action?

64
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,429
What do you mean by action?
- I knew... that's why I made arrangements...

65
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:42,160
What arrangements?
- Just see.

66
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:44,901
Look.
- What's this?

67
00:08:45,006 --> 00:08:46,304
Shirt.
- What about it?

68
00:08:46,507 --> 00:08:48,041
You'll wear it.
- Why should I wear it?

69
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:49,173
Do you know where we're going?

70
00:08:49,644 --> 00:08:50,611
Where? Wherever I go?

71
00:08:50,878 --> 00:08:52,345
You'll have to wear this
where you're going.

72
00:08:54,682 --> 00:08:58,648
These are bell bottoms.
- Biman, I've never worn these.

73
00:08:59,353 --> 00:09:00,786
You've never gone to that place either.

74
00:09:01,756 --> 00:09:04,122
You'll make me a Park streeter...

75
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,601
What, you haven't shaved?
Shave.

76
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,827
Whose flat?
- A lady's.

77
00:09:42,564 --> 00:09:43,926
Rich?
- No.

78
00:09:44,699 --> 00:09:46,064
Don't you have any other questions?

79
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,394
Young or old?

80
00:09:50,738 --> 00:09:55,875
Don't know, never seen her, Nikhil's contact...
- Our person?

81
00:09:56,277 --> 00:10:01,139
Allows us to stay... Remember
the name, Shila Mitra.

82
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,810
You will see her after a couple of days.

83
00:10:06,488 --> 00:10:08,115
She is away now... Delhi...

84
00:10:10,125 --> 00:10:11,023
Will she return?...

85
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:12,020
I'm told... after a couple of days...

86
00:10:12,794 --> 00:10:13,852
You've to stay alone for two days.

87
00:10:14,829 --> 00:10:15,454
Alone?...

88
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:18,558
The lady lives alone?

89
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,961
This is the key to paradise...

90
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:34,682
Come.

91
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:51,531
Wow!
Fantastic...

92
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:58,394
8th floor means you're 9 storeyed.

93
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:00,872
Decorated hell...

94
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:04,202
What do you say?
- Hell.

95
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:09,114
Any difference between jail
and this place?

96
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:13,750
Oh! Money plant...

97
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:18,591
Money on shaking... good luck

98
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:26,399
Me, you, our landlady...
what do you say?

99
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:30,200
Didn't you include our group?
The party... let me keep it inside...

100
00:11:30,672 --> 00:11:32,936
Biman... have you been here before?...

101
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:34,108
Mad or what?

102
00:11:36,811 --> 00:11:39,211
Goddamn what a place... Superb.

103
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:41,613
You said that there's no telephone...

104
00:11:44,352 --> 00:11:45,341
Hey... don't pick it up...

105
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:51,855
Let it ring, what's that to you and me?...

106
00:11:56,864 --> 00:11:58,297
Can't say, may even be the C.I.A...

107
00:12:05,807 --> 00:12:06,507
Stop it.

108
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:16,485
Give a cigarette.

109
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:25,084
My cigarette stock is almost finished... could
you get me few packs of Charminar?

110
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,035
Relieved.

111
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:44,304
The lady gets up very early?
- How could you get up?

112
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:47,147
Or else who could have called so early?

113
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,746
Good... good for the health

114
00:12:52,255 --> 00:12:57,219
The time...
passing the time is very difficult...

115
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:02,923
I'm thinking... I'll write an adventure story
about these details...

116
00:13:07,436 --> 00:13:09,562
What... Biman...

117
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:12,701
This is a girl's room...

118
00:13:13,576 --> 00:13:14,372
I mean a lady's

119
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,171
First class, very safe...
nobody will enter...

120
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:22,109
...it will be trespass on entry...
We'll file a case.

121
00:13:22,685 --> 00:13:25,017
But these materials are Mrs Mitra's.
See what have you done?

122
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:25,746
Please stop.

123
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:29,491
You stay here... this is much safer.

124
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:31,593
Okay.

125
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,108
But the matter is...

126
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:36,724
Listen, be careful,
till she comes back...

127
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,859
That means I don't have to be careful when
she returns...

128
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:40,934
Stay as safe as you can.
- I understand.

129
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,365
Now I'm going... I've arranged everything
properly...

130
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:47,872
There's the toilet... here's the key
- Key?

131
00:13:49,378 --> 00:13:50,510
Key... for the flat?
- Yes

132
00:13:51,314 --> 00:13:53,782
What can I do with the key of the flat?
I'm not going out for a stroll.

133
00:13:54,684 --> 00:13:55,343
Keep it with you...

134
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,377
You'll be coming?
- Yeah... I'll be coming... okay

135
00:14:05,127 --> 00:14:06,185
Biman, listen.

136
00:14:12,969 --> 00:14:13,669
Biman.

137
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:15,902
Who am I?

138
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:20,872
Oh! Sorry... forgot to tell you.
You are Mrs Mitra's.

139
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:31,743
Salaam sir... I'm the cleaner...

140
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,515
I've come to check whether you've arrived

141
00:14:33,723 --> 00:14:36,123
Yeah... he's arrived... taking a bath inside

142
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:39,401
Madam has asked me
to take care of you.

143
00:14:39,402 --> 00:14:42,796
I'll be downstairs always...
if you need me just call.

144
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,099
Okay...

145
00:14:47,003 --> 00:14:47,993
Who?
- The cleaner...

146
00:14:52,408 --> 00:14:55,775
has come to take care as per madam's
instruction...

147
00:14:57,413 --> 00:15:01,110
You are madam's cousin...

148
00:15:02,518 --> 00:15:07,512
you live in Delhi... you've come here
for a visit...

149
00:15:10,059 --> 00:15:11,720
Come here for a visit.

150
00:15:16,098 --> 00:15:16,928
And Mr. Mitra?

151
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:18,196
Let him go to hell...

152
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:41,039
Yesterday in Dum Dum area north Calcutta
3 terrorists escaped from a police van...

153
00:16:42,219 --> 00:16:45,484
Immediately after this an intensive search
was started...

154
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:49,712
It is reported that
though 2 out of the 3 escaped...

155
00:16:49,713 --> 00:16:51,722
They captured the other one...

156
00:16:54,364 --> 00:16:55,956
Would you get me some tea... strong.

157
00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:02,967
Does Nikhil know?

158
00:17:04,007 --> 00:17:05,167
He must by this time.

159
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,001
The action was not correct.

160
00:17:08,779 --> 00:17:13,113
I took a great risk... it's only luck
that I wasn't caught...

161
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:20,554
Mass copying has started in
various colleges in Calcutta...

162
00:17:20,657 --> 00:17:23,825
so that the V.C. of Calcutta
University Satyendranath Sen

163
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:26,994
has met in Darbhanga Hall with the
principals of all colleges...

164
00:17:27,998 --> 00:17:32,560
Apart from other things the disease
of bad habits that...

165
00:17:35,105 --> 00:17:39,667
Escaped, got caught, escaped again...

166
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:44,411
So what now?

167
00:17:46,249 --> 00:17:46,874
What?

168
00:17:48,185 --> 00:17:49,015
You'll stay absconding...

169
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,020
I'll remain a fugitive... only a fugitive,
nothing else...

170
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:58,721
...'sports news'

171
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:01,591
That day I met your father on the streets...

172
00:18:02,966 --> 00:18:04,900
I was returning home from the office
after marketing...

173
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:13,840
He talked about this and that, talked about
many things but never once asked about you.

174
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:18,804
Not even once. I think he is very angry
with you.

175
00:18:19,783 --> 00:18:22,547
Very much... Since you're a revolutionary.

176
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:35,054
But you said once your father was in a
terrorist party...

177
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,129
was in prison during British Rule.

178
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:55,708
Then he was greatly involved
in the movement of '42...

179
00:18:56,853 --> 00:19:00,152
I don't know how people changed so much.

180
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:15,258
He would probably say the
nation has become independent

181
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,703
and there are lots of changes.

182
00:19:17,774 --> 00:19:19,833
But what has happened?

183
00:19:21,211 --> 00:19:29,211
Inclub zindabad...

184
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:34,801
Bobby Bobby...

185
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:45,905
Come Bobby

186
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,716
I said don't.

187
00:22:15,547 --> 00:22:17,515
You know... always there's fear...

188
00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:20,117
Yeah fear... even in a lift.

189
00:22:20,985 --> 00:22:21,679
How?

190
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:23,578
Believe me... as many
people are in the house

191
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:24,647
...the number of dogs are not less

192
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:26,775
Chased...

193
00:22:26,776 --> 00:22:30,122
Yeah, you smelled of revolution?

194
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:33,220
Not at all, comrade of bread and curry...
let me put it away...

195
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:40,502
Hey Biman... this is too much...
there was no need for this.

196
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:45,632
So... you wouldn't have eaten
anything... fasting?

197
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:47,941
Take a look.

198
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:51,907
Wow!

199
00:22:52,617 --> 00:22:53,413
Oh!

200
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,981
With all the food that is here,
I can feed you for 2 days...

201
00:22:58,056 --> 00:23:01,548
and here there's gas, a stove etc... will
you eat?

202
00:23:01,826 --> 00:23:04,090
For now you eat this... I'm going

203
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:06,794
What's the hurry with you?

204
00:23:06,898 --> 00:23:08,490
Oh! I've brought cigarettes for you

205
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:10,263
4 packs of Charminar...

206
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:11,563
Relieved

207
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,498
Here's a match box... okay I'm going

208
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,364
Hey Biman...

209
00:23:19,411 --> 00:23:23,040
you are moving about so much,
be careful...

210
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,873
Karim

211
00:25:58,201 --> 00:25:59,005
Karim

212
00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:05,002
Bishey...

213
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:18,815
Only sleeping... do you know how late it is?

214
00:26:20,205 --> 00:26:22,318
Prepare the tea, get up...

215
00:26:58,552 --> 00:26:59,528
How many spoonfuls?

216
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:01,373
Eh...

217
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,637
...one & a half

218
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,314
Father you leave... I'll stay here...

219
00:28:25,853 --> 00:28:27,127
What'll you do by being here?

220
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:30,021
You'll be late for the office...
go for a bath... I'll stay here.

221
00:28:30,637 --> 00:28:36,470
You haven't forgotten that I must go
to the office and arrange for your food...

222
00:28:36,471 --> 00:28:38,048
You still remember it...

223
00:28:40,442 --> 00:28:44,142
You go. There's nothing to be done here
except removing the pulse from the oven...

224
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:52,730
How are you, mother?

225
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:55,637
Well.

226
00:28:56,752 --> 00:28:59,244
Who went to bring the ration today?

227
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:06,387
Who else except for him... why?

228
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:10,463
No... I found father's mood is a bit off...
that's why.

229
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:20,970
Look. The milk is here. It's hot...
drink it when it gets cool...

230
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,511
Huh!

231
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,157
Where is Biru? Not in the house.

232
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,000
No.

233
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,200
He went out first thing in the morning.

234
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh... he is having his class exams.

235
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:12,473
We too have worked for the country... have
gone to prison...

236
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:17,334
our concern for the betterment of the
country is no less than anyone else's...

237
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:20,535
I find the young boys have
become so irresponsible nowadays.

238
00:30:20,942 --> 00:30:21,642
Listen, father...

239
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,839
I know... I know...

240
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:28,853
I won't be able to win a verbal battle
with you... you have become learned...

241
00:30:28,854 --> 00:30:32,929
reading a few books of the party
makes you think you've become very wise

242
00:30:34,454 --> 00:30:39,497
you just make a shower of words... we too
knew about the revolutionaries,

243
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,730
talked about revolution... We too
read the works of Lenin.

244
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:47,463
Where were you then...

245
00:30:47,464 --> 00:30:52,573
your leaders were drowsing in the
dark... used to take opium, I understand

246
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,041
...opium...

247
00:30:55,548 --> 00:30:58,327
Listen father... what you
don't know or don't understand

248
00:30:58,328 --> 00:30:59,546
about those things...
like a fool.

249
00:31:07,562 --> 00:31:08,263
So...

250
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:10,250
why did you stop?

251
00:31:11,404 --> 00:31:12,105
Say it.

252
00:31:16,897 --> 00:31:19,113
Come eat... you are going to be late for
the office

253
00:31:19,862 --> 00:31:23,361
Stop... no one needs to do
anything for me...

254
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Just see these boys nowadays... they
can say things that they're not supposed to

255
00:31:37,192 --> 00:31:42,236
will say whatever they like... wonderful...
I'll be late for the office.

256
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,186
Nobody will have to remind me about my
responsibility...

257
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,000
Ask you to go... go eat...

258
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,900
What's that to me...

259
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
I am male.

260
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,050
I am strong.

261
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,200
I can do everything...
I was in politics once...

262
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,000
but you'll suffer... only you...

263
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,200
The condition of our country
as it's becoming every day...

264
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:07,007
That's... mine

265
00:34:11,154 --> 00:34:13,073
Hello! My name is Shila...

266
00:34:14,624 --> 00:34:17,749
Oh! Yes hello!...

267
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,464
Er... give those to me...

268
00:34:20,465 --> 00:34:21,319
That's alright.

269
00:34:22,341 --> 00:34:25,263
Biman asked me to stay in this room...
- Who?

270
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:27,555
Biman who brought me here...

271
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,141
Oh.

272
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:31,335
This paper is yours?

273
00:34:31,439 --> 00:34:34,839
Yes... I can stay in the living room...
no trouble.

274
00:34:36,258 --> 00:34:39,256
Yes... why are you standing?
Please sit down.

275
00:34:40,347 --> 00:34:42,266
I feel... I'm the guest of the house

276
00:34:42,572 --> 00:34:45,594
Yeah... I've forcefully occupied...

277
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:47,350
forcefully occupied...

278
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,778
What else... Almost like capturing
Windsor palace.

279
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:52,844
Without any bloodshed.

280
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:54,496
Peaceful transition.

281
00:36:24,133 --> 00:36:27,615
Who is our enemy and who is our friend...

282
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:33,060
this is the most important
question in the case of revolution.

283
00:36:34,949 --> 00:36:38,218
We've seen repeatedly
that to fight the enemy

284
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:41,521
we've not been able to
join hands with friends

285
00:36:41,522 --> 00:36:44,543
so in the past many of
our wars have failed.

286
00:36:47,182 --> 00:36:51,558
The primary responsibility of a fighting
organization is to inspire the people...

287
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,068
to show the way...

288
00:36:54,190 --> 00:37:00,084
no revolution can be successful if the
fighting organization misleads the people.

289
00:37:01,401 --> 00:37:04,392
If you can develop friendship
with true friends...

290
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:06,444
only then will the war be successful.

291
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,397
My office? 9:30.

292
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,508
You don't like coffee very much?

293
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:01,464
Why do you say that?

294
00:38:02,143 --> 00:38:02,844
Isn't that right?

295
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:04,430
Rightly guessed.

296
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,741
That's what I thought.

297
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:10,932
How do you know?

298
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:13,622
I saw a lot of tea leaves
beside the basin...

299
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:15,784
a lot

300
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:19,759
I'm very sorry... I didn't know where to
dispose of that many tea leaves...

301
00:38:21,282 --> 00:38:22,661
Where would you dispose of them?

302
00:38:23,574 --> 00:38:24,281
Sugar?

303
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:27,273
One and a half...

304
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:38,661
What's up?

305
00:38:39,714 --> 00:38:45,171
As you weren't here I had to make
tea... and so many tea leaves.

306
00:38:47,263 --> 00:38:48,870
Hello... I am Biman...

307
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:56,475
Hello

308
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:58,968
Hello

309
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:00,889
Come please

310
00:39:04,095 --> 00:39:06,083
Come... come

311
00:39:07,734 --> 00:39:10,123
Biman... sit

312
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,908
I will have tea.

313
00:39:12,485 --> 00:39:13,898
I was really afraid.

314
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:16,794
Now you've arrived, please keep the key.

315
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:19,482
He kept the key...

316
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:23,931
as it's not very safe for
me to go out... so he kept it.

317
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:27,843
No... you keep the key...
I've got another one.

318
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,199
Sugar?
- Oh give it to me.

319
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,151
Eat

320
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:42,200
Oh lovely

321
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:43,149
It's hot

322
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:44,528
No really not

323
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:45,434
Take it

324
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:34,953
What happened?

325
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,781
Nikhil... I can't understand this.

326
00:40:38,293 --> 00:40:39,062
Which place?

327
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,181
Here... where there is much rewriting.

328
00:40:41,865 --> 00:40:44,690
Oh that place: our educational system.

329
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:45,971
No... no... that's alright

330
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:46,784
Then

331
00:40:46,785 --> 00:40:47,692
Here

332
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:50,079
In our country...

333
00:40:52,480 --> 00:41:00,292
Against our bourgeois education. I'm
putting the word bourgeois down. Listen.

334
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,162
Do it quickly...
I'll write another 2 pages...

335
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:06,709
you'll finish all the work...
then after printing this...

336
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,903
you will be relieved... understand?

337
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:12,325
And tomorrow remove this in the early
morning before the work starts.

338
00:41:13,101 --> 00:41:17,341
if you can do it tonight okay...
and look...

339
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:20,022
Biman

340
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:32,254
Come

341
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:40,512
Why are you so late?

342
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:45,758
There is a total jam in North Calcutta, trams
and buses not moving. I had to walk.

343
00:41:46,275 --> 00:41:47,044
Have puffed rice...

344
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:55,131
Take this... read...

345
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:01,331
It will be a very late night today...
you know.

346
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:05,429
Have you finished?

347
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,281
Wait... it's not a machine like yours...

348
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,558
I will finish, only then can I go home...

349
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,380
and will I get any time off
the next day?

350
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,529
Those are ready?

351
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,474
Yes

352
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:26,777
Superbly narrated here.

353
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:27,660
Where?

354
00:42:28,979 --> 00:42:30,657
It's about their meeting in Maidan...

355
00:42:32,113 --> 00:42:35,203
Is it all right or will you say I
have made excesses?

356
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,975
But I was in that meeting...

357
00:42:39,492 --> 00:42:40,802
You? What?

358
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,390
I was in that area on some work...

359
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:49,119
Had some time in hand... saw a packed
crowd... so listened for some time

360
00:42:49,332 --> 00:42:51,086
It was not proper for you to go there...

361
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:54,375
the boys of their party could have
identified you... you might be in trouble

362
00:42:54,925 --> 00:42:59,969
No... I didn't enter the crowd... and I
couldn't be seen.

363
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:02,101
Why the unnecessary risk?...

364
00:43:11,211 --> 00:43:12,417
Nikhil... what does this one do?

365
00:43:12,694 --> 00:43:14,403
Which one?
- This one here

366
00:43:14,919 --> 00:43:16,022
Oh something...

367
00:43:17,647 --> 00:43:23,703
That day in the meeting... there was a big
crowd, a great public gathering...

368
00:43:24,454 --> 00:43:25,694
Must have been over a hundred thousand

369
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:28,524
So you're quite impressed?

370
00:43:31,631 --> 00:43:35,032
You know Biman... they will go on doing this
forever...

371
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:39,472
They will arrange and gather people
by train,

372
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:45,812
by hiring buses, by walking, they will
bring people from various places...

373
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:49,351
They'll provide food
as they always do...

374
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:54,233
People will come with their families
to see Calcutta.

375
00:43:55,287 --> 00:44:00,330
This is the last one... do it carefully.
There is some overwriting.

376
00:44:01,083 --> 00:44:04,888
And you know what happens after that...

377
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:09,326
you saw it today...
meetings... hot speeches...

378
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:13,377
resolutions, songs and
music... pandemonium...

379
00:44:14,156 --> 00:44:17,787
trams and buses are stopped... revolution...

380
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:21,771
But they are saying we haven't got public
support...

381
00:44:22,581 --> 00:44:24,259
the public is not with us...

382
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,257
whatever is coming fears
us and our threats...

383
00:44:28,511 --> 00:44:31,670
we have not been able to make
the common people aware.

384
00:44:36,879 --> 00:44:38,486
Don't believe it.

385
00:45:54,649 --> 00:45:57,073
Adulation... Everywhere only
adulation...

386
00:45:57,278 --> 00:46:04,219
the paradise of adulation... within
this pure baby food Henco's Vita tone...

387
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,830
Vita tone in the service of the country
and everyone's children

388
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:12,272
the baby food Henco's Vita tone...

389
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:16,212
to bring a smile to a child's face and raise
hopes in a mother's mind...

390
00:46:16,316 --> 00:46:20,050
One and only Henco's Vita tone.

391
00:46:22,886 --> 00:46:26,115
Wonderful, you have made our point very
very well.

392
00:46:26,425 --> 00:46:28,607
Tell her... she has done the job...

393
00:46:29,626 --> 00:46:31,005
Shila has done everything...

394
00:46:31,412 --> 00:46:32,077
Not at all.

395
00:46:32,591 --> 00:46:33,797
I must congratulate you...

396
00:46:34,646 --> 00:46:35,450
Thank you

397
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:39,160
Well may I see it once again?

398
00:46:42,768 --> 00:46:44,445
Certainly... start it.

399
00:46:49,406 --> 00:46:50,474
When can you deliver it?

400
00:46:51,293 --> 00:46:53,580
It won't take much time.

401
00:46:53,955 --> 00:46:57,150
Still, an approximate time.

402
00:46:57,561 --> 00:46:59,984
Well, within 6 months...

403
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:02,507
you know the electical conditions...

404
00:47:03,997 --> 00:47:06,754
It's being said conditions
are improving...

405
00:47:06,995 --> 00:47:07,994
Ready

406
00:47:34,828 --> 00:47:37,183
Adulation everywhere...

407
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:42,320
the paradise of adulation in this
pure baby food Henco's Vita tone...

408
00:47:42,321 --> 00:47:45,137
in the service of the
country and everyone's children...

409
00:47:45,645 --> 00:47:47,812
Henco's baby food Vita tone...

410
00:47:47,813 --> 00:47:52,447
Made with Vita tone and amino
acid: Henco's baby food Vita tone.

411
00:47:57,733 --> 00:47:58,536
I can't understand...

412
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:57,536
I can't understand...

413
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:15,582
no I can't understand that
so many people...

414
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:18,709
so many fresh young boys dedicated...

415
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:23,139
and prepared to do everything...
but what are they doing...

416
00:48:23,546 --> 00:48:26,255
what they are made to
do... what are you doing...

417
00:48:26,256 --> 00:48:29,466
what I'm doing... you've
carried forward the revolution...

418
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:30,750
you've not surrendered...

419
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:33,141
Oh no... I haven't surrendered...

420
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:37,896
Eating and sleeping and in your language

421
00:48:37,897 --> 00:48:44,802
waiting for instructions. Don't you
see we've no programme in front of us?

422
00:48:45,449 --> 00:48:47,465
Well, Biman, don't you see that...

423
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,458
we are floating in air...
darkness... blank...

424
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:58,419
Sumit, now you're temporarily confined
here... no way to go out...

425
00:48:59,399 --> 00:49:03,972
communications cut off... that's why you're
frustrated

426
00:49:04,184 --> 00:49:10,181
No... you know only cliched words
frustration, cut off, escapism...

427
00:49:11,405 --> 00:49:15,978
Any question which previously I didn't ask,
didn't know how to, now I'm asking...

428
00:49:17,437 --> 00:49:18,677
I've not said it like that...

429
00:49:18,786 --> 00:49:22,225
Yes you said it... cut off...

430
00:49:22,226 --> 00:49:27,207
Okay I'm cut off but
you're not cut off...

431
00:49:27,884 --> 00:49:32,226
You're moving around, working... Yeah with
plenty of risk...

432
00:49:33,005 --> 00:49:35,613
You're coming to me as
many times as necessary...

433
00:49:35,614 --> 00:49:38,014
Tell me... say with
your hand on your heart...

434
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:45,500
Have you got any aim, any organization,
group from which you could get energy..

435
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:47,119
Strength...

436
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:55,711
I am sorry, Biman...

437
00:50:00,816 --> 00:50:03,538
You are probably thinking that I'm injecting
poison into your mind...

438
00:50:11,363 --> 00:50:12,132
You know really...

439
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:21,162
You, me, nobody can go back...
It's not possible to return...

440
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,548
Sumit I... I'm going...

441
00:50:26,661 --> 00:50:27,361
Hey...

442
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:29,147
don't break your promise...

443
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:30,293
...sit dpwn... sit down

444
00:50:30,772 --> 00:50:34,069
I will serve you tea
with a ham sandwich...

445
00:50:36,466 --> 00:50:38,700
Why am I feeling like going to
the toilet so often today?

446
00:50:38,701 --> 00:50:40,148
Because you're drinking more cold water...

447
00:50:44,806 --> 00:50:45,874
Very good.

448
00:50:48,176 --> 00:50:52,415
Mihir, you see, this is too much...

449
00:50:54,577 --> 00:50:58,311
Shila, I know, we know this is over the top...

450
00:50:58,689 --> 00:51:00,607
There is a streak of genius in you.

451
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:06,225
It's not fair...

452
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:10,406
Sister you see...

453
00:51:10,516 --> 00:51:12,331
What can the sister see...

454
00:51:13,819 --> 00:51:17,381
Spent her entire life in marketing and
the kitchen...

455
00:51:18,132 --> 00:51:22,004
but it can't be said that
she hasn't dabbled in art...

456
00:51:23,725 --> 00:51:26,689
You see... just draws a bit and see how he's
teasing...

457
00:51:30,094 --> 00:51:32,102
Listen... Shila listen...

458
00:51:32,103 --> 00:51:37,803
Today in the history of our office
it's an event, a remarkable event...

459
00:51:38,855 --> 00:51:42,658
Why?

460
00:51:43,808 --> 00:51:46,129
An event because, yes, it's an event.

461
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:51,167
A client like this in
the baby food product line...

462
00:51:51,168 --> 00:51:55,768
where everybody in the ad world
knows him to be a tough nut...

463
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:59,948
you floored him with the depiction
of the story.

464
00:52:00,522 --> 00:52:03,037
I've done as per the brief
given by the client

465
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,500
They give a brief and then change it...

466
00:52:05,857 --> 00:52:06,661
Change it very often...

467
00:52:08,484 --> 00:52:12,965
So I'm saying we, who are admirers of the
lady...

468
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,600
Admirer!

469
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:20,487
We, who are admirers, are requesting...
requesting earnestly

470
00:52:28,877 --> 00:52:36,793
Shila, I am requesting today you'll have
whisky just to celebrate this occasion...

471
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,671
No... no... no... not me.

472
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:41,982
I suggest we all invade her flat
one of these days.

473
00:53:38,223 --> 00:53:41,750
Today a few important questions have come
to my mind... that's why my letter...

474
00:53:43,312 --> 00:53:48,735
with whom and for whom is our war... with
the public and for the public...

475
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:53,550
for farmers, middle class
and working class people...

476
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:57,563
my question... have all of
them joined as they should have?

477
00:53:58,745 --> 00:54:01,675
Not in fear but at their own urging.

478
00:54:09,578 --> 00:54:10,347
Hello...

479
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:13,549
You... ringing up once again...

480
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:19,781
No, I won't listen to anything...

481
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:36,917
I'm telling you I won't say...
what's the matter with you...

482
00:54:36,919 --> 00:54:37,876
Haven't I told you?

483
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:42,395
Look, look, why do you keep
disturbing me like this?

484
00:54:43,578 --> 00:54:45,898
Why do you go on disturbing me again and
again...

485
00:54:46,981 --> 00:54:48,968
When you know the relationship has ended.

486
00:54:49,878 --> 00:54:51,693
Then allow
me to live as I wish...

487
00:54:52,305 --> 00:54:53,374
You do as you wish.

488
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,404
Yeah right, I'm responsible.

489
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:02,722
Your behaviour... you day after day...

490
00:55:05,729 --> 00:55:06,706
You listen to me, yeah...

491
00:55:09,334 --> 00:55:12,529
So what do you want me to do... what?

492
00:55:13,244 --> 00:55:14,151
Money...

493
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:16,307
You want money...

494
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:17,924
Again.

495
00:55:20,454 --> 00:55:21,327
Blackmail...

496
00:55:23,049 --> 00:55:24,461
Aren't you ashamed?

497
00:55:26,217 --> 00:55:31,226
No! No... you won't get even a paisa...

498
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,430
Yeah... I am aware of prestige... I've been
able to leave you as I'm aware of it...

499
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:43,732
Why are you telling about this again...
look, leave me alone... I'm tired...

500
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:47,745
No more

501
00:55:51,354 --> 00:55:55,420
The child is mine.

502
00:55:56,442 --> 00:55:59,464
...the child is mine...

503
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:03,057
No more!

504
00:57:16,804 --> 00:57:19,894
Well, in the drawing room...

505
00:57:20,646 --> 00:57:26,341
meaning in that room, I saw a picture

506
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:31,561
on the wall, a painting... whose?

507
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:32,701
Oh!

508
00:57:33,855 --> 00:57:34,521
Yeah

509
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:36,203
Whose picture is that?

510
00:57:34,169 --> 00:57:35,203
Whose picture is that?

511
00:57:36,326 --> 00:57:37,532
That is my son...

512
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:39,526
Why?

513
00:57:39,830 --> 00:57:40,737
Oh! Just...

514
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:51,482
An artist, one of our friends painted
it... how is it?

515
00:57:52,365 --> 00:57:54,444
Good... what's his name?

516
00:57:55,061 --> 00:57:56,336
Whose? Of the artist?

517
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:57,786
No your son's...

518
00:57:57,790 --> 00:57:58,443
Kunal

519
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:00,356
Kunal?

520
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:04,160
A very unusual name... how old is he?

521
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:05,888
Now... 6 years old.

522
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:10,565
Does he still ride horses? I saw a wooden horse
in that room

523
00:58:11,148 --> 00:58:15,652
No... no not horses... horses
aren't in now... now it's cricket...

524
00:58:16,775 --> 00:58:19,497
Ready... Googly...

525
00:58:21,391 --> 00:58:23,206
Oh my!

526
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:25,468
Slowly

527
00:58:27,557 --> 00:58:29,269
Out!

528
00:58:30,758 --> 00:58:32,206
My son says he is Gavaskar...

529
00:58:33,421 --> 00:58:35,500
And you? Bedi...

530
00:58:37,194 --> 00:58:37,895
Chandrashekhar?

531
00:58:41,003 --> 00:58:44,024
When my son comes... I am not spared...

532
00:58:46,494 --> 00:58:53,330
Meaning when he comes to Calcutta... he
studies in Darjeeling... on vacation...

533
00:59:03,332 --> 00:59:04,928
You'll excuse me...

534
00:59:04,929 --> 00:59:10,134
Last night when you were talking
on the phone... I heard...

535
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:16,540
You became very excited...
you weren't talking normally...

536
00:59:16,541 --> 00:59:21,116
Talking loudly... and I
was just in the next room

537
00:59:22,842 --> 00:59:27,955
All my friends... got quite messed up,
you know...

538
00:59:31,232 --> 00:59:35,737
I tried very hard... But we couldn't
live together...

539
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:39,452
He was creating a lot of trouble...

540
00:59:40,365 --> 00:59:43,053
He is still making trouble.

541
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:44,370
Tries to...

542
00:59:46,632 --> 00:59:49,148
Oh! I'm going to be late for the office...
I'm leaving, okay?

543
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,328
Won't you eat anything?

544
00:59:50,373 --> 00:59:52,050
I'll have to get my breakfast
somewhere else...

545
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:54,643
You finish all these.

546
00:59:54,888 --> 00:59:55,956
Okay.

547
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:02,243
Last night you didn't have dinner...

548
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,871
very bad...

549
01:00:15,768 --> 01:00:18,858
Hello, my name is Shila Mitra.

550
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:23,143
Me and a few of my office colleagues
have come on a special mission.

551
01:00:23,144 --> 01:00:24,079
To make a survey.

552
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:31,095
Which you can call... yeah, an attitude
survey...

553
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:38,568
We've got a question for you... we've
heard of many changes in our country...

554
01:00:38,569 --> 01:00:41,973
social, political and many others.

555
01:00:43,095 --> 01:00:48,029
Our question is, this
change... could it be found

556
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:52,469
in the relationship
between female and male...

557
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:57,204
or is it that whatever was there
forever is still going on?

558
01:00:58,528 --> 01:01:03,537
Listen... nowadays going out,
working, earning...

559
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,178
we are doing everything like men...

560
01:01:06,179 --> 01:01:10,824
but still what is needed for total
freedom of women hasn't happened as yet.

561
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:17,629
Because even now whether we earn or whether
we travel...

562
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,269
whatever... depends on
the consent of men...

563
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,239
we do not do anything
against their will.

564
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:27,942
On paper female and male
enjoy the same rights...

565
01:01:27,943 --> 01:01:30,534
that's what we've heard...

566
01:01:33,741 --> 01:01:37,103
we can only say more and more
women are getting an education...

567
01:01:37,104 --> 01:01:38,784
and getting the opportunities of an education...

568
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,750
they have gotten a certain amount
of economic freedom.

569
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:47,121
If you talk about the social
structure of our country...

570
01:01:47,122 --> 01:01:53,053
then it has to be said that the conditions
still prevailing in our country...

571
01:01:54,004 --> 01:01:57,189
have not changed totally...

572
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:01,070
some changes have come but not completely...

573
01:02:01,855 --> 01:02:04,797
As for the partial changes
that have occurred

574
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:07,875
there certainly has
been some respectability.

575
01:02:08,493 --> 01:02:11,893
I can't say exactly if the respectability
has increased...

576
01:02:12,301 --> 01:02:16,783
what has increased is the awareness that...

577
01:02:16,784 --> 01:02:23,619
relations between male and
female are under stress and strain.

578
01:02:24,701 --> 01:02:31,074
The more women enter the labour market
and mercantile affairs as a commodity...

579
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:34,100
their identities are getting changed...

580
01:02:35,012 --> 01:02:38,447
Nora's privileged position
in The Doll's House...

581
01:02:38,448 --> 01:02:41,607
here I use the word
privileged in quotes...

582
01:02:42,301 --> 01:02:47,919
they've definitely come out of there but
haven't gotten the same recognition as men.

583
01:02:48,204 --> 01:02:50,995
A society stands on its wealth... this
society...

584
01:02:51,708 --> 01:02:56,091
...like other countries, ours
too is a democratic country...

585
01:02:56,092 --> 01:02:59,452
here, who's got the wealth
also has the power...

586
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:07,711
here, those who aren't rich equally have
no pride

587
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:13,350
I've seen from the experience
of my political career...

588
01:03:13,351 --> 01:03:20,951
that in any movement a young widow
comes with such determination for our work

589
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:26,910
that those who live under the guardianship
of husband or son... they can't...

590
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:31,900
she always waits for the agreement
of husband or son.

591
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:40,150
In any poor family where
the husband is established...

592
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:46,134
such families are a fine picture...

593
01:03:46,678 --> 01:03:49,801
but where the wife is more
established than the husband...

594
01:03:49,802 --> 01:03:53,146
there arises some complex
question... husbands can't accept it...

595
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:57,349
quarrels start and the results don't
bode well.

596
01:03:57,865 --> 01:04:00,908
You can see changes everywhere...

597
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:08,655
about 20 years ago I saw a group of 15
or 16 women going to the Ganges to bathe

598
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:11,975
taking at least a boy of 10 years old...

599
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,755
now you do not find such things...

600
01:04:14,756 --> 01:04:19,238
but in my own family my mother-in-law
has never gone out anywhere

601
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:21,682
without a closed horse-driven cart...

602
01:04:22,295 --> 01:04:25,609
but after my marriage
gradually I've seen her

603
01:04:25,610 --> 01:04:30,004
going to her daughter's place
by bus, going to the hospital...

604
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:34,401
in all places, in meetings
and processions, on roads,

605
01:04:34,402 --> 01:04:37,524
buses and trams, in cinema
halls and playgrounds,

606
01:04:37,525 --> 01:04:39,709
I'm seeing women in large numbers...

607
01:04:40,289 --> 01:04:42,053
but this is not enough of a change...

608
01:04:42,054 --> 01:04:45,907
because the main thing is the
oppressive social conditions...

609
01:04:46,253 --> 01:04:49,044
Here if the social structure is not changed,
the freedom of women is doubtful...

610
01:04:50,027 --> 01:04:55,953
The conditions are so intertwined that

611
01:04:55,954 --> 01:05:01,879
unless the social structure is changed

612
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:06,800
there can't be any change
in women's conditions.

613
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:15,488
I'm saying again before
ending my long letter

614
01:05:15,489 --> 01:05:19,766
...India now requires
revolution in all stages.

615
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:26,517
Darkness, superstition,
poverty and oppression...

616
01:05:26,518 --> 01:05:29,774
against all sorts of attacks...

617
01:05:31,197 --> 01:05:35,083
to create a new society
and new people...

618
01:05:35,084 --> 01:05:39,987
but if we ever make any
mistake in this extreme war...

619
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:44,856
If we take wrong steps
in blind rage...

620
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:50,040
if we get sucked into destruction
and blundering mistakes

621
01:05:50,041 --> 01:05:52,988
then history will never forgive us.

622
01:05:53,774 --> 01:05:55,348
I salute the revolutionaries.

623
01:07:38,776 --> 01:07:41,567
Hello what's up? At this time?

624
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:43,185
What's the time?

625
01:07:43,998 --> 01:07:48,375
An executive director of our company
died... a stroke...

626
01:07:49,692 --> 01:07:50,462
...the office is closed.

627
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,369
Very good... so! Now you can have a good
sleep

628
01:07:56,196 --> 01:07:59,688
I came to the office today...
there was a board meeting...

629
01:08:02,767 --> 01:08:03,709
Anyway... I'd like to have tea

630
01:08:06,892 --> 01:08:07,696
Hello...

631
01:08:10,094 --> 01:08:11,507
This is a wrong number.

632
01:08:13,598 --> 01:08:14,575
Tea or coffee?

633
01:08:14,811 --> 01:08:15,581
Tea

634
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,673
I knew you would have tea...

635
01:08:19,225 --> 01:08:20,397
Why do you read so many books?

636
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:22,523
Did you say something?

637
01:08:25,324 --> 01:08:30,367
No... I was saying hasn't Biman come today?

638
01:08:31,928 --> 01:08:33,847
No... he hasn't come the last 4 days

639
01:08:38,702 --> 01:08:40,012
What? He isn't in any trouble... is he?

640
01:08:40,421 --> 01:08:43,143
No... problem... I don't think so...

641
01:08:44,195 --> 01:08:49,238
Nothing more to say... don't you see in the
papers how arrests are being made!

642
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:52,141
Why are you laughing?

643
01:08:55,819 --> 01:08:57,531
There will be none to continue the heritage.

644
01:08:57,942 --> 01:08:58,746
Meaning

645
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:03,533
because of the arrests being made!

646
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:33,771
Biman is a very cautious person...
he won't be caught easily...

647
01:09:35,064 --> 01:09:36,445
Probably he is angry at me.

648
01:09:37,591 --> 01:09:38,256
Really?

649
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,863
Yeah that day I had a big argument
with him.

650
01:09:44,971 --> 01:09:47,556
What? You are like us...

651
01:09:48,913 --> 01:09:50,901
if you quarrel you don't see each
other's face...

652
01:09:52,620 --> 01:09:55,170
there must be some cause.

653
01:09:55,484 --> 01:09:56,586
Yeah... there is...

654
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:59,484
I probably said a little too much
that day...

655
01:10:00,707 --> 01:10:03,464
Maybe... he has reported against me...

656
01:10:04,919 --> 01:10:08,657
I am showing doubts...

657
01:10:08,658 --> 01:10:14,823
criticism, frustration, defeatism.

658
01:10:32,024 --> 01:10:34,919
Take it... the latest... you haven't got it...

659
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:40,042
How did you get it?

660
01:10:40,717 --> 01:10:43,302
Why? Haven't I got any intelligence?

661
01:10:44,357 --> 01:10:45,333
No... not that...

662
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,041
A bearer of my office supplies brings
these to me...

663
01:10:51,837 --> 01:10:55,709
from somewhere he has heard that my
brother...

664
01:10:58,071 --> 01:11:03,965
you know I'm not Bengali... my native place
is Punjab...

665
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:12,657
But I have been always here... in
Calcutta... my father had a business here...

666
01:11:14,582 --> 01:11:17,741
The house that you have seen, all the
materials...

667
01:11:17,963 --> 01:11:18,962
Everything is my father's...

668
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,000
my brother... younger brother...

669
01:11:25,172 --> 01:11:32,169
my only brother, very bright like you all...

670
01:11:34,606 --> 01:11:39,181
from childhood he was a bit unusual...

671
01:11:39,182 --> 01:11:45,683
different from this house...
self-willed, obstinate...

672
01:11:45,704 --> 01:11:49,988
a don't care type, independent...
used to quarrel

673
01:11:50,398 --> 01:11:58,039
father didn't like his
friends... was very dogmatic...

674
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:03,807
It looked like they
were enemies forever.

675
01:12:06,708 --> 01:12:12,097
Then one day 3 years ago... my brother

676
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:17,485
left the house... forever...

677
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:20,012
Punjab...

678
01:12:22,107 --> 01:12:26,139
Punjab was very disturbed then as it was in
Calcutta.

679
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:33,739
Have you heard of Ropar?

680
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:39,651
Ropar... from there my
brother wrote a letter to me...

681
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:44,816
Don't think of me. I am not alone.

682
01:12:44,817 --> 01:12:48,503
With me there are hundreds
of thousands of people...

683
01:12:48,504 --> 01:12:52,768
those who are dreaming to build
a new society... fighting...

684
01:12:54,523 --> 01:12:57,344
the hungry people of
our country are fighting.

685
01:12:57,345 --> 01:12:59,566
People who barely have one meal a day.

686
01:13:00,049 --> 01:13:03,793
All of Asia is
fighting, Latin America...

687
01:13:03,794 --> 01:13:09,068
I want to live among all the
freedom loving people of the world.

688
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:12,383
That is the last letter of my brother.

689
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,979
Sumit

690
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,875
With revolutionary salutation, Sumit.

691
01:14:05,846 --> 01:14:07,328
So nowadays Sumit...

692
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,536
So Sumit nowadays is thinking like this.

693
01:14:15,247 --> 01:14:18,246
Sumit wants to meet you...

694
01:14:18,853 --> 01:14:21,802
Wants to talk with you face to face...

695
01:14:21,803 --> 01:14:26,070
and Nikhil whatever I said
about Sumit and the lady...

696
01:14:26,071 --> 01:14:28,320
I've no concrete proof of that.

697
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:33,638
You just said you've seen them.

698
01:14:34,555 --> 01:14:40,243
Yeah... just that... I saw just that...
I thought at the time.

699
01:14:40,368 --> 01:14:46,262
Biman, you may go now... we will have to
think about Sumit.

700
01:14:47,545 --> 01:14:50,475
Come back in about 4 days... go.

701
01:14:50,780 --> 01:14:52,261
What do I say to Sumit?

702
01:14:52,565 --> 01:14:53,875
You'll not go there now.

703
01:14:56,475 --> 01:14:57,175
Okay.

704
01:14:57,586 --> 01:14:58,293
Listen...

705
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:06,774
you are not eating properly...
your health is declining... be careful...
715r
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:08,729
The situation in your area is not good.

706
01:15:09,144 --> 01:15:09,851
I know...

707
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:10,690
Do you know Amal?

708
01:15:11,065 --> 01:15:12,475
Amal, who?
- Of Belgharia

709
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:14,592
Amal...? Is he arrested?

710
01:15:15,378 --> 01:15:19,146
We have doubts about him...
we have concrete proof

711
01:15:19,287 --> 01:15:20,964
Nikhil, you are making a mistake.
Go...

712
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:52,402
Long live... long live...

713
01:15:53,725 --> 01:16:01,804
Unity of labour... war, war...

714
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:11,338
We want to live making war...

715
01:16:21,322 --> 01:16:23,711
Dearness allowances must
be paid at the enhanced rate...

716
01:16:34,329 --> 01:16:36,110
Retrenchment will not be allowed.

717
01:16:36,654 --> 01:16:44,733
War, war we want to live making war...

718
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:59,657
Long live... long live...

719
01:17:22,582 --> 01:17:23,581
Are you coming?

720
01:17:23,896 --> 01:17:29,285
Oh no... ok bye... bye bye.

721
01:17:31,006 --> 01:17:33,119
Bye bye thank you for coming

722
01:17:33,702 --> 01:17:35,517
Good night... see you.

723
01:18:32,846 --> 01:18:34,052
Hey... were you asleep?

724
01:18:34,531 --> 01:18:35,237
No.

725
01:18:36,182 --> 01:18:37,353
You had to remain confined for a long time.

726
01:18:38,473 --> 01:18:41,563
So... what can you do?

727
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:46,655
You know, really I tried very hard to stop
them from coming today.

728
01:18:47,470 --> 01:18:48,171
Why?

729
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:50,562
I don't like all this.

730
01:18:55,793 --> 01:18:59,389
I've not said anything to you for you
to call them.

731
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:02,491
I didn't call them.

732
01:19:20,391 --> 01:19:21,701
Your telephone...

733
01:19:31,006 --> 01:19:31,776
your telephone

734
01:19:40,218 --> 01:19:40,925
Hello...

735
01:19:43,216 --> 01:19:45,732
you... how are you?

736
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:51,127
I'll call him. Hold on...

737
01:19:53,224 --> 01:19:56,717
There's a call for you.

738
01:19:58,649 --> 01:19:59,350
For me?

739
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:02,451
A call for me?

740
01:20:04,547 --> 01:20:05,960
Yeah... Nikhil...

741
01:20:07,445 --> 01:20:08,650
wants to talk with you...

742
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:12,263
Hello...

743
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:16,338
yeah, quite well... as far as possible in this
situation...

744
01:20:17,621 --> 01:20:21,355
Nothing new... going on... yeah

745
01:20:23,720 --> 01:20:26,718
For a few days me too... yeah

746
01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:28,863
Yes I've talked with Biman.

747
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:32,676
Yes, I wrote those words in a letter.

748
01:20:34,638 --> 01:20:36,751
How strange...
if I've some questions then...

749
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:41,377
Hey... listen Nikhil,
Nikhil... I am saying that

750
01:20:41,378 --> 01:20:45,073
I don't want to talk about this
on the telephone or by letter...

751
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:50,474
No listen... strange... you
should at least listen to what I have to say

752
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:58,572
...yeah... I am saying... these
are certain basic questions...

753
01:20:58,573 --> 01:21:00,152
which are to be discussed. Yeah...

754
01:21:00,153 --> 01:21:01,700
should be discussed
face to face. Yeah...

755
01:21:01,701 --> 01:21:02,400
What

756
01:21:04,704 --> 01:21:05,310
Oh

757
01:21:07,702 --> 01:21:10,700
Well indeed.

758
01:21:12,386 --> 01:21:13,764
So you question my integrity...

759
01:21:14,914 --> 01:21:16,993
after such a long time.

760
01:21:18,014 --> 01:21:21,817
You... no listen Nikhil... for me to discuss
these issues... on the phone

761
01:21:22,428 --> 01:21:25,382
if I could have faced
you then... these words

762
01:21:25,383 --> 01:21:27,437
...no... no Nikhil... the lady...

763
01:21:29,336 --> 01:21:30,001
...what?

764
01:21:30,626 --> 01:21:31,232
Me?

765
01:21:32,715 --> 01:21:33,321
The lady...

766
01:21:34,703 --> 01:21:35,610
Who said this?

767
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:38,035
Biman...

768
01:21:38,915 --> 01:21:39,822
Biman... has said?

769
01:21:41,746 --> 01:21:42,584
Biman has reported?

770
01:21:44,643 --> 01:21:45,447
Nikhil...

771
01:21:46,430 --> 01:21:47,740
that's my personal matter...

772
01:21:49,428 --> 01:21:51,610
yeah... I'm not bound to give an explanation
for this.

773
01:21:53,741 --> 01:21:55,993
No... no!

774
01:22:04,457 --> 01:22:05,560
What did Nikhil say?

775
01:22:07,725 --> 01:22:10,850
Probably I can't stay in this house
anymore.

776
01:22:12,544 --> 01:22:14,219
Why?
- That only Nikhil knows...

777
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:15,846
and Biman.

778
01:22:39,069 --> 01:22:39,770
Come in.

779
01:22:43,180 --> 01:22:44,087
Sit.

780
01:22:46,684 --> 01:22:48,603
What's your news? It's been so long.

781
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:50,862
The key to your flat...
I'll not be needing it anymore

782
01:23:07,104 --> 01:23:08,011
Would you have tea or coffee?

783
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:09,089
I'm in a hurry.

784
01:23:10,305 --> 01:23:12,522
Wait for 5 minutes...
I've finished my work...

785
01:23:13,203 --> 01:23:14,684
we will go together, yeah.

786
01:23:14,888 --> 01:23:17,312
No... today I'm in a hurry... okay?

787
01:23:30,028 --> 01:23:33,757
There's a saying in Bengali:
a dilemma everywhere...

788
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:36,290
my condition is more or less like that.

789
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:41,449
I was saying...

790
01:23:43,238 --> 01:23:44,340
was saying

791
01:23:46,406 --> 01:23:47,404
Here I've no problem...

792
01:23:49,134 --> 01:23:49,904
you can stay here.

793
01:23:53,548 --> 01:23:54,961
No... I can't

794
01:23:57,154 --> 01:23:57,819
Why?

795
01:23:59,648 --> 01:24:06,013
You thought everything is finished...
now only comfort and rest...

796
01:24:10,936 --> 01:24:12,176
But I've not said this to you.

797
01:24:13,968 --> 01:24:14,772
You know...

798
01:24:17,136 --> 01:24:21,169
the time it takes to build a party,
it is the same when leaving.

799
01:24:22,932 --> 01:24:25,758
But the party wants you...

800
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:27,540
Look...

801
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:31,996
the party is nobody's personal property.

802
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:37,550
You've got to fight inside and outside.

803
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:39,956
You are alone.

804
01:24:41,002 --> 01:24:41,771
At present.

805
01:24:43,192 --> 01:24:44,191
Biman will not come to this house anymore.

806
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:49,051
I know...

807
01:24:51,415 --> 01:24:53,402
...once I too was like Biman...

808
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,191
didn't know how to question...

809
01:24:57,917 --> 01:25:05,488
cannon fodder without questions, without
thought.

810
01:25:47,451 --> 01:25:49,633
Where is Sumit? I need Sumit very badly...

811
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:54,019
the condition of Aunty is very bad...

812
01:25:54,662 --> 01:25:57,960
your mother... your brother came to my
house...

813
01:25:59,043 --> 01:26:04,868
Wants to see you at once... do what you think
best... I'm going...

814
01:24:38,980 --> 01:24:39,956
You are alone.

815
01:24:41,002 --> 01:24:41,771
At present.

816
01:24:43,192 --> 01:24:44,191
Biman will not come to this house anymore.

817
01:24:48,213 --> 01:24:49,051
I know...

818
01:24:51,415 --> 01:24:53,402
...once I too was like Biman...

819
01:24:55,020 --> 01:24:56,191
didn't know how to question...

820
01:24:57,917 --> 01:25:05,488
cannon fodder without question, without
thought.

821
01:25:47,451 --> 01:25:49,633
Where is Sumit? I need Sumit very badly...

822
01:25:52,641 --> 01:25:54,019
the condition of Aunty is very bad...

823
01:25:54,662 --> 01:25:57,960
your mother... your brother came to my
house...

824
01:25:59,043 --> 01:26:04,868
Wants to see you once... do what you think
best... I'm going...

825
01:26:08,856 --> 01:26:09,959
Biman!

826
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:18,549
Now what will you do?

827
01:26:20,987 --> 01:26:21,859
What's the time?

828
01:26:22,873 --> 01:26:23,677
It's about 9

829
01:26:23,884 --> 01:26:24,591
Oh!

830
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,864
I can drop you there?

831
01:26:40,059 --> 01:26:42,678
Okay... stop here... I'll get out...

832
01:26:43,462 --> 01:26:44,875
it won't be prudent to go any further.

833
01:26:45,586 --> 01:26:48,377
You'd better go...

834
01:26:49,123 --> 01:26:51,304
Please ring me and inform me how she is.
- I'll try...

835
01:26:51,718 --> 01:26:53,291
Do you know my number?
- Yes

836
01:26:53,706 --> 01:26:54,476
I will wait...

837
01:26:55,425 --> 01:26:58,182
You should leave. It won't be safe for you
to stay here alone.

838
01:27:30,334 --> 01:27:32,414
Who? Who?

839
01:27:32,544 --> 01:27:33,348
You?

840
01:27:35,644 --> 01:27:36,747
Could have come a bit earlier...

841
01:27:38,508 --> 01:27:39,921
since you finally came...

842
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:45,750
yeah, she wanted to see you.

843
01:27:48,044 --> 01:27:48,848
Go

844
01:27:51,650 --> 01:27:52,454
Go

845
01:28:34,006 --> 01:28:34,879
Biru

846
01:28:37,308 --> 01:28:38,112
Biru

847
01:28:40,409 --> 01:28:41,213
Biru

848
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:54,083
Why didn't come a bit earlier... you could
have seen her alive.

849
01:29:03,693 --> 01:29:07,725
Biru, when did you inform Biman?

850
01:29:08,444 --> 01:29:11,305
You were informed... who gave the message?

851
01:29:33,009 --> 01:29:33,812
Listen.

852
01:29:35,064 --> 01:29:35,729
Me.

853
01:29:36,648 --> 01:29:40,140
I want to talk to you... come.

854
01:29:46,521 --> 01:29:48,566
Hello, how are you dear?

855
01:29:49,419 --> 01:29:50,154
Well

856
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:54,675
Sit

857
01:29:56,461 --> 01:29:58,977
Please go away. I'll talk for some time.

858
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,370
That you've come is very good...

859
01:30:06,469 --> 01:30:09,732
You are the elder son... you have
responsibilities.

860
01:30:10,951 --> 01:30:16,569
They have come, all these people..
they are all aware.

861
01:30:18,196 --> 01:30:23,883
So I was saying it won't be right for you
to stay here...

862
01:30:27,698 --> 01:30:30,489
so I was saying don't worry about me...

863
01:30:32,483 --> 01:30:37,081
they are here... somehow they'll manage
the necessary work

864
01:30:37,082 --> 01:30:39,985
and Biru will do the last rites.

865
01:30:42,793 --> 01:30:44,907
You'd better go before more people are aware.

866
01:30:54,621 --> 01:30:57,413
Father, please be careful.

867
01:30:58,327 --> 01:30:59,304
I'll be alright...

868
01:31:00,889 --> 01:31:05,128
and Biru's job... I believe
he'll get it... but...

869
01:31:06,449 --> 01:31:09,240
I'm going... I'm going.

870
01:31:10,021 --> 01:31:10,825
Okay.

871
01:31:18,242 --> 01:31:19,149
Well.

872
01:31:20,062 --> 01:31:21,406
Mother talked about me?

873
01:31:22,455 --> 01:31:23,155
Yeah.

874
01:31:26,027 --> 01:31:27,738
I haven't yet said one thing to you.

875
01:31:29,329 --> 01:31:30,305
I didn't tell your mother...

876
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:32,758
because of what would happen if I told her...

877
01:31:33,844 --> 01:31:38,451
It wouldn't do her any good...
let the rest of her days be peaceful.

878
01:31:40,348 --> 01:31:41,519
7 days ago...

879
01:31:42,975 --> 01:31:46,341
the manager of our office called me
into his room...

880
01:31:47,221 --> 01:31:50,747
only me... called many others...

881
01:31:52,478 --> 01:31:59,280
and gave me a printed paper bond
I won't be able to strike gold with.

882
01:32:01,070 --> 01:32:05,678
but I'm telling you...
