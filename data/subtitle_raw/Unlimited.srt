could have burned down

200

back in those days.

201
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,583

202
00:12:32,665 --> 00:12:34,875
During Apollo.

203
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,500
That's how I met
your Professor Armando.

204
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:41,250
So you went to NASA,
and now you run an orphanage.

205

206
00:12:42,415 --> 00:12:45,375

since my NASA days.

Oh, yeah?

208
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,708

Well, there's a little bit
more to it than that.

213
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,375
I know plenty of people
who are highly motivated

214

216

217

three goals in life.

Find my passport
and get out of here.

223

That's a goal in life?

better than that.

a little trick.

918
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:39,666
See this guy, the light bulb,

919
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,541
hasn't changed much
since its conception,

920
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:49,208
but in order for it to work,
it needs a power source.

921
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:51,375
And we need wires.

922
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:52,833
These are very important.

923
00:44:52,916 --> 00:45:01,708
See, these wires carry
energy from the battery

924
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:06,375
all the way up
to the light bulb,

925
00:45:06,458 --> 00:45:08,875
which heats up the filament,

926
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:13,708
which excites electrons
to create...

1015
00:49:38,583 --> 00:49:40,000
All right, so this
captures radio waves

1016

could evenly distribute
the heat on that chicken,

1072

and made it rotate.
