1
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,280
Oh God, let my scent be
perfume to him.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,850
Let my taste be honey

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,160
and my embrace more dear to him
than all the world,

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,120
with the exception of you,
who wields power.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,040
Oh God, let me aid him
in his obedience to you.

6
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,690
Let him aid me in mine.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,480
God, let me be the apple of his eye
and endow him with virtue.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,160
Let us not unleash our violence
on each other.

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
Come on, Grandma.

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,130
Use the one upstairs.

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,400
My stuff's in here.
Why is Grandma still staying with us ?

12
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,650
Again, Halima ?

13
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,160
Not now, Mother.
Spare me the headache.

14
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,760
Get inside before your father
sees you.

15
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
Make up the guest bed.

16
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,080
Your sister will be staying
for a while.

17
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,960
Hurry up and make the tea.

18
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:35,360
-Welcome.
-Thank you. Thank you.

19
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Welcome. Welcome.

20
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,000
Amra, you're drowning in work.
Slaving over a hot stove with no help.

21
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,280
A woman is a queen
as long as she's at home.

22
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,840
Your little queen got beaten
up today.

23
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,120
The educated engineer swore
an oath to divorce me.

24
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Come on, Jiji. Sit down.

25
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,320
Meat again, Mom ?
I'm vegan now.

26
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,480
The teacher taught us to respect
animal rights.

27
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Eat what's there, you spoiled brat,
instead of whining.

28
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,520
- What's wrong with it ? It's halal.
- No, Mom, it's torture to animals.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,040
Salad ?

30
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,480
Hurry up, Grandma,
I need the bathroom !

31
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Give me your hand.

32
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,320
Do your eyes still hurt ?

33
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,200
When are we going
to Tuha's concert ?

34
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,080
Tuha who, Mother ?
Just sit here.

35
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,690
Who's Tuha ?

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,240
Grandma's losing it.
She's stuck in the 70s.

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,640
- The tea, woman !
- I'm coming.

38
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,080
God, safeguard my husband's heart,
ears, eyes, tongue and loins.

39
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,880
I ask you who preserves
those under Your protection.

40
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,600
God, God, please don't deny us
Your blessings.

41
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,320
AMRA AND THE SECOND MARRIAGE

42
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,170
Subtitles from
YavkA.net

43
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Amra, your prices are sky high.

44
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,050
Take whatever you like.

45
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,480
Can I take some ma'moul for fifty ?

46
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,970
Sure.

47
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,920
Can I take two dozen
and only pay for one ?

48
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
As you like.

49
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
Amra, if you keep selling at a loss
you'll never make any money.

50
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,520
I'm happy. I enjoy working
with my hands.

51
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
What would they say if I refused ?

52
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,960
A penny saved...

53
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,040
Hilal retires in three months and
with his check we'll be set for life.

54
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Hey, Amra. Seen this stunner ?

55
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
That's privatization.

56
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,960
Her father's one of the contractors
doing the restructuring.

57
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,800
They moved in opposite me and suitors
are lining up outside the house.

58
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,320
I bet you she'll be engaged
before the week is out.

59
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,960
God take those dirty field workers,
with their oil-stained hands.

60
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,800
How does she get her hair so silky ?

61
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,480
That's privatization, sister !
Not public sector, like us.

62
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
She lives at the beauty salon.

63
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Where's your mother, Jamila ?

64
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,850
Come closer.

65
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,640
Do you need me to refill
your gas tanks ?

66
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,960
We filled them last week.

67
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,520
Drop Jamila off at school.
The bus was late today.

68
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
And hurry back here.

69
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
Amra, you need to economize.

70
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,250
The monthly allowance ?

71
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Be patient, just for this month.

72
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,840
- But...
- A temporary hardship.

73
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Yes, sir.

74
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,680
Ask the girls to economize too.

75
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
As you command.
You're their father.

76
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,560
I see. Wonderful.

77
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
The operation will be in a month.

78
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,440
I'll give you...

79
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,170
a recommendation.

80
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,760
Of course, we need
your guardian's approval.

81
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,440
I'm sorry, Um Jamila.
Gasoline prices have soared.

82
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,080
Here, Uncle Marzouq.
May God protect us.

83
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,320
Get ready. We're leaving
in ten minutes.

84
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,210
Alright, I'm coming.

85
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,160
And try to economize.
The bills are piling up.

86
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,600
Mommy,
is it okay if I stay at home ?

87
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,810
You want to stay here all alone ?

88
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:58,600
So what ? Halima's staying.
And I could practice the piano.

89
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,480
The lessons are only once a week.

90
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,760
You especially need them,
to improve your Arabic.

91
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,960
But Mommy, the microphone
and the sheikh's voice hurt my ears.

92
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,840
Sheikh Odeh is a man of God.
We go so God will bless us.

93
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,280
Don't talk to me
about God anymore !

94
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,160
May God bless you.
Sheikh Odeh's monthly donations...

95
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
Women are the firewood
that makes Hell burn.

96
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,480
They take their mates for granted.

97
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,280
Showing ingratitude to one's husband
is a mortal sin.

98
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,160
Fear God and obey your husbands
and your families.

99
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,400
Don't show ingratitude
to your husband.

100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Fear God, because women are
Hell's firewood.

101
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,920
- How was your piano lesson ?
- Don't be late again.

102
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,160
I waited half an hour in the sun.

103
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,360
We've paid the electricity bill.
Didn't we agree to economize, Amra ?

104
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,280
We appreciate you, Mama Sa'adia.

105
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
The house lacks a man's presence
for weeks on end

106
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
and you run in and out as you please.

107
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,240
Someone had to pick up Jamila
from school.

108
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Why ? Where's the bus ?

109
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,760
A temporary hardship
for a few months.

110
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,240
- Then we'll get the retirement check.
- Costs go up.

111
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,560
- Economize, Amra.
- God help us.

112
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,400
What's this ?
How long has Nafisa been here ?

113
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
- Just since my father passed away.
- Is she planning on staying forever ?

114
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,400
- Where else can she go ?
- Nafisa is old. She needs care.

115
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,480
Hilal and your family require
your full attention.

116
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,320
You'd both be better off
if you put her in a care home.

117
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,770
While I'm still alive ?

118
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,290
I'll care for her.

119
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,370
She doesn't need much.

120
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,760
What this house needs is a man,
not more old women.

121
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,960
Hilal deserves a son.

122
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,760
You've been a good mother
to his daughters,

123
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,480
but what Hilal needs now is
a new bride.

124
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,400
What's a man worth in our society
without a son ?

125
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,250
How much are these ?

126
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,280
No, Mama Sa'adia. No way.

127
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
That's very kind of you, Amra.

128
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,840
I hope Amra didn't see.
She's been suspicious lately.

129
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,120
- Shall I knife her ?
- What ? She's a harmless lady.

130
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
I could almost believe
she bakes these for smokers.

131
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,240
It's good to be outside,
to see the horizon.

132
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,920
- Stick your hair out of the window.
- What ?

133
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,480
I want to see your hair flowing
while I drive.

134
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,520
Is that how it is, brother ?
"Obey, girl" and "Yes, master !"

135
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
At least persuade me.

136
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,560
God, you're in a strange mood.
Indulge me.

137
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,080
No.

138
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,560
God. Women.

139
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,080
Abu Lama, may I burden you
with a favor ?

140
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,520
Could you drop Jamila off at school ?

141
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,250
Just for a few days.

142
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,560
It would be my duty as a neighbor.

143
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
MA'MOUL = 150

144
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,440
KLEICHA = 175

145
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
KLEICHA = 200

146
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,840
Finally we can congratulate Hilal.

147
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,520
- God bless you. We're delighted.
- You turned out a wise woman.

148
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,280
Sa'adia bet on the winning horse.

149
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,400
You know, we were worried
about how to tell you.

150
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,210
Tell me ?

151
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,330
What are you talking about ?

152
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,600
Hilal's retirement.
We've slaughtered a sheep.

153
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,880
So you don't know !
Hilal's getting married.

154
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:14,720
Sa'adia has already spoken
to the new neighbors.

155
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,680
She's arranging for Hilal
to marry Ishtar.

156
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,930
Ishtar ?

157
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:23,080
Look, Amra, don't wail and pout
like these young girls.

158
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,400
These are our old ways.
You're a woman who values tradition.

159
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,920
Yes, of course. No wailing.

160
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,320
The cell number you are calling
is currently unavailable.

161
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Amra ? Are you OK ?

162
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,240
- My kleicha ! My ma'moul !
- Your what ? What's going on ?

163
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,600
Hilal's getting married. Sa'adia's
arranging the Syrian girl for him.

164
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,560
I'm sorry, Amra. We were afraid
to break it to you.

165
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,840
- With my kleicha ?
- Consent. What can you do ? Object ?

166
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,440
- Life isn't like the movies.
- Hilal won't accept this.

167
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,680
This makes you more well-liked
in the camp.

168
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
Everyone in the camp is relieved.

169
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
They feared for their men.

170
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,330
What about me ?

171
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,320
We gave them sons. They have
no reason to take a second wife.

172
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,840
Oh God, who harnesses hard hearts,
wayward servants and solid mountains,

173
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,920
harness my husband to my service,
blind him and block his ears,

174
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,840
so he may perceive no woman's charms,
save mine. Amen.

175
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,320
ISTIKHARA PRAYER

176
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,360
I've decided to look for
a second wife for him.

177
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,640
Hilal has the right to a son.

178
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,800
God says in the Quran,

179
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
"Wealth and sons are...

180
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,410
"Adornments."

181
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,320
"...adornments of this life."
May God bless your offspring.

182
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,720
Sheikh, a woman seeking reassurance
in her decision

183
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,730
isn't ungrateful to her husband.

184
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,040
She's afraid Satan is deceiving her.

185
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,920
How can she be sure
God is pleased with her ?

186
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,960
- Did you hear me ?
- Perform the Istikhara prayer.

187
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,400
Purify your intentions and turn to God
with a pure heart.

188
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
He will guide you towards
the bountiful path.

189
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,240
But Istikhara, Sheikh...
Please don't be angry but...

190
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,210
its effects may take a while.

191
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,360
Are there other tangible signs ?

192
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
Come closer, my child.

193
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,440
There are those who see signs
in the shapes of the clouds

194
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
that praise their Lord.

195
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,160
Signs come to others in flashes
that soon fade.

196
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
Istikhara ? That's it ? Nothing else ?

197
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,400
And reciting the Quran to protect
your home and children from evil.

198
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,040
Really, Sheikh ? When will you come
to recite upon our home ?

199
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,760
Play the tape at your home
and drink holy water.

200
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,480
Know that victory comes with patience,
relief with affliction,

201
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
hardship with ease.

202
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Pay on your way out.

203
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,560
Find holy water for drinking.
Also olive oil.

204
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Wait. One moment.

205
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,600
Take this for the girls' tuition.

206
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
HOLY WATER

207
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,730
Darling...

208
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,960
Your tuition fee is on the desk.
Take it in tomorrow.

209
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,720
Don't play music.
Not while the Quran is playing.

210
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,160
God, I seek aid in Your knowledge
that encompasses everything.

211
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,640
Oh God, guide your lost servant
and grant me a sign.

212
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,000
Oh God, guide your lost servant
and grant me a sign.

213
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,280
You'll love her.
You'll absolutely adore her.

214
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,840
Congratulations to us !
We finally found a bride for Hilal.

215
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,840
A well-presented lady.
And they happen to be our neighbors.

216
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,850
Ishtar is radiant.

217
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,120
You'll go together well in this house.
Light upon light !

218
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,120
Where's Nafisa's hospital form ?

219
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,520
I've already told all the ladies
in the camp.

220
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,360
Amra is my daughter.
She has always behaved with honor.

221
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,160
She never refuses me a request.
Nor do I her.

222
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,330
Ishtar will bring the family a son,

223
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,040
who will provide for your daughters
when Hilal grows old.

224
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,600
Hilal has never said to me
that he wants a son.

225
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,040
Don't shame Hilal's manhood !

226
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,200
Stop your selfish woman's wailing.

227
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,330
Wailing ? Me ? Wailing ?

228
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,040
We're both women. You come with me
to arrange Hilal's marriage.

229
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,520
A lady of honor and tradition
appreciates another like her.

230
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,560
Ishtar will bring happiness
to your home.

231
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,640
Endear yourselves to each other
like sisters, not rivals.

232
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,520
She's nothing special.
A sack of bones.

233
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
Inflated lips and a designer dress.

234
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,000
She's adorable.
Like a Datsun to a Ferrari.

235
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,450
We don't compare.

236
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
What if she fails to deliver a son ?

237
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:06,800
She who is fortunate
remains fortunate.

238
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,200
She has the face of a rival.
We won't get along.

239
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,000
Tell me. Are you going
to arrange the marriage ?

240
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,010
I don't know.

241
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
I have to pray more.

242
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
No signal. There's interference.

243
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,560
That's a devil eye, Amra.
That's bad.

244
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,650
It is an eye.

245
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,640
I need to protect my home,
so it might subside.

246
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,520
Greetings, neighbor.

247
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,960
I just wanted to tell you that...

248
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,920
it's no problem at all driving Jamila
every morning.

249
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,080
It's a blessed opportunity.

250
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Say, do you need some help here ?

251
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,960
No, no. May God reward you
for your kindnesses.

252
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,520
We've paid the amount due
for the bus.

253
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,800
Great. Well... Can I ask you
for your cell number ?

254
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,120
Just in case the bus continues...

255
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,690
to be unavailable.

256
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
You can call me whenever.

257
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,480
Or you could just knock on the door.
I live right here.

258
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,280
My cell number, yes. I'll have Jamila
give it to your daughter.

259
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:05,240
OK, well...
I'm going to finish my jog.

260
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,560
OK, sure, go please. Thank you.

261
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,960
Know that hardship comes with ease.

262
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,640
WE ARE PROPOSING TOMORROW.
BRING SOMETHING. HONOR US

263
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,920
So...
What do you think ?

264
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,560
The customization is killing us.

265
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,040
Are you paying anything ?
Eat shit and keep working.

266
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,520
- Hello.
- I'm dry.

267
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,570
What ?

268
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,720
Can you hear me ?

269
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
Nothing is for free, except...

270
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
I got us enough cash
for a couple of months.

271
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,080
Alright. I can get what you want.

272
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,960
Where are you going at this hour ?

273
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,640
- I won't be long.
- Entrusting sheep to a wolf.

274
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,160
Don't tell your little sisters.

275
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,120
It's God's will in the end.
And Hilal wants a son.

276
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,320
- God ! Do you believe that ?
- What use is it to object ?

277
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,920
It's a small community.
I do my duty.

278
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,960
For God's sake. The problem is
our own subservience.

279
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:30,040
Also, God hasn't given me a sign.
Does no signal mean he's pleased ?

280
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,650
A flash.

281
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,280
A sign. Hilal belongs to his daughters.
That's the sign !

282
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,650
I have a confession.

283
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,920
You're getting older.
And I've been too strict.

284
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,200
We need more dialogue
in this house.

285
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,480
Not centralized power.
Not tyranny.

286
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,760
We should vote on everything.

287
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,960
Like who comes and goes.
Especially who comes in.

288
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,760
Your grandmother Sa'adia
is up to something.

289
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,410
- She...
- Cut it out.

290
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,080
- Dad's marrying the new girl.
- It's his Mom !

291
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,800
Hilal's only doing it
because of her meddling.

292
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,400
When he gets home, set him straight.
Tell him, "How dare you ?"

293
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,560
Stop stressing me. Leave me out
of your arguments.

294
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:27,120
When Dad gets back, I'll ask for money
so I can go to school in the morning.

295
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,760
- What ? I gave you the full amount.
- You didn't. You never do.

296
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,840
Great. Let's fight
and forget the food.

297
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,250
Cheese as well ?

298
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:43,960
I told you, I'm vegan,
which means I don't eat cheese.

299
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,080
These international schools
don't teach you manners.

300
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Your baking's wonderful, Amra.

301
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,320
Whatever happens, I'm your mother.
A stepmother has a heart of stone.

302
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,320
- Yes, of course.
- If Hilal finds out, he'll ground you.

303
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,120
- Where do you think I go ?
- How should I know ?

304
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,480
But a stepmother won't cover
for you with Hilal.

305
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,520
Hilal ? Where is he ? He only shows up
at the end of the month.

306
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,640
And I'm only using this app,
like everyone else.

307
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,520
Stop wailing like the old ladies
in the camp.

308
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,760
Listen, Amra.
Nobody wants you here.

309
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,320
You didn't congratulate Ishtar
and give her your blessing.

310
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,680
You spoiled the spirit of the camp.

311
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,370
- I just...
- Spare me !

312
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Take your things and leave.

313
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,920
No one will eat from the hand
of a spiteful traitor.

314
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,200
This is a collective decision.

315
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,370
- But I...
- Enough wailing.

316
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
Be on your way.

317
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,840
Victory comes with patience,
hardship with ease.

318
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Me ? Wailing ?

319
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
I'm not here. I'm not here.

320
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Sa'adia will not allow herself
to be dishonored in front of the camp.

321
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,280
Ishtar is moving in.
She'll occupy the ground floor.

322
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,760
But Nafisa can't use the stairs.

323
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,120
Nafisa ? Take her somewhere else.

324
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,640
She's none of our concern.
She's expelled from Hilal's home.

325
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,810
Ishtar, Hilal's wife,

326
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,800
enters her husband's house
with her head high.

327
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,120
From now on, the ground floor
of the house is Ishtar's wing.

328
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,880
You deserve that.

329
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,010
Hilal will never accept this.

330
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,410
Don't be naive.

331
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,360
Isn't this the happiness
you promised for us ?

332
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,000
Husband, house and home.
Stability. The big prize.

333
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,760
Listen.
Your idealism is your failing.

334
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,640
Don't revel in my misfortune.
Tell me what you would do.

335
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,290
Me ? Nothing extraordinary.

336
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,600
He'll get back with me eventually.
I have his boy.

337
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
Enough of this shit.

338
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,520
Sands, in the kingdom of sands,
are your biggest enemy.

339
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,160
Where is your will to lift up
your head from the sand ?

340
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,520
What do you want ?

341
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,850
How are you ?

342
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,810
Good. Thank God for your return.

343
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,440
Prepare and iron my shemagh
and thobe by this evening.

344
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,450
As you command.

345
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:01,080
And don't forget my formal cloak.
I'm going to lie down.

346
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,400
What's wrong ?
You look pale and weak.

347
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,480
Ishtar moves into my house ?

348
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,760
The Istikhara didn't do any good.

349
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,480
It's not like putting chlorine
in a pool.

350
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,880
You need faith.
Nothing is difficult to God.

351
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,600
Istikhara opens your heart.

352
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,930
I can't get a signal.

353
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,280
It's not God.
The problem is in you.

354
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,200
You think it's a punishment ?
What did I do ?

355
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,360
Nothing. Someone cast a spell on you.

356
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,960
This is the kind of magic that drives
a wedge between a man and his wife.

357
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,600
- Istikhara can't undo it.
- Don't talk nonsense, Sarah.

358
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,890
Nonsense ?

359
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,890
A sieve can't hide the sun.

360
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
These are all signs of magic.

361
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,520
When your husband stops
looking you in the eye,

362
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,240
and abandons your bed,
when you dream of someone else...

363
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Who would do it ? Sa'adia ?

364
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,040
Don't ask me. Ask yourself.

365
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,880
Search the depths of your soul.
Revelations will come in dreams.

366
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,560
I can't handle Sa'adia's evil.

367
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,360
Should I resist or just submit to her ?

368
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,560
Too late for that, sister.

369
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,600
They want to force you out.
You need to stand your ground.

370
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,530
Cast a counter spell.

371
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:03,200
Now she wants to take my mother
from me.

372
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Tomorrow she'll get rid of me.

373
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,600
The Syrian is controlling Sa'adia.
It's like she found the Prophet's coin.

374
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,080
She took all that golden check
and spent it on her shopping.

375
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,480
Sa'adia believes in God above
and in Ishtar below.

376
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,930
Even her honeymoon.

377
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,240
Sa'adia arranged a trip to Malaysia
and Ishtar insisted on Europe.

378
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,640
A cruise to Europe.
Is this magic or is it not ?

379
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,280
In a divorce I'd end up on the street.

380
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,240
- I know what to resort to.
- To magic.

381
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,840
No.

382
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,560
KHUL'

383
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,560
THE PROCESS FOR A WOMAN
TO DIVORCE HER HUSBAND

384
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Welcome, sister.

385
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,520
And that's why I want a khul'.

386
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,320
Do you know why women
were created ?

387
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,040
- Why ?
- I'm asking you.

388
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
To worship God ?

389
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,170
Correct.

390
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,880
And obedience to your husband is part
of obeying God.

391
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,200
A wife's role in an ideal Islamic
society is to establish a family.

392
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,880
Establishing a family.
Of all lawful acts,

393
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,800
the most detestable to Allah
is divorce.

394
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,800
- Isn't the law to protect people ?
- Sharia contains common good.

395
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,160
When there is polygamy between
a worthy male

396
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,360
and wise women,
to share the burden of responsibility,

397
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,680
it can impact the family, the community
and the nation in many good ways.

398
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:59,800
- When can I see the counselor ?
- Which counselor ?

399
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,130
The judge.

400
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,000
Am I not worthy of the role ?
I am the judge.

401
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:11,400
Look, sister. A khul' requires
proof of conjugal abandonment,

402
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,050
And you must return the dower

403
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,520
and the expenses of 20 years
of marriage, in your case.

404
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,240
And litigations are long.

405
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
May I ask you a question ?

406
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
How many wives do you have ?

407
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,840
I have Um Abdul Hakim,

408
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,970
Um Oais,

409
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,120
and Um Ghaliya.

410
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,600
How old are you, Sheikh ?

411
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,480
And sharia allows me a fourth.

412
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,720
Yes, hello. Is that the care home ?

413
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,560
May I ask about the conditions
for your elderly residents ?

414
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:11,240
A good Muslim doesn't smoke
cigarettes.

415
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,480
Enough. You're doing my head in
with your noise.

416
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,160
Where can I rehearse in this house ?

417
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,960
Bring it in here, Jiji.

418
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,890
Leave her alone.

419
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,360
Things are missing.
Where's my hairdryer ?

420
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,570
Take it easy. No fuss.

421
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,320
Fuss ? The whole camp is talking
about us and our house.

422
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,760
All because you
defy Grandma Sa'adia.

423
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,240
Thanks to you,
we're constantly broke now.

424
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:08,160
We've grown accustomed to burying
our heads in the sand,

425
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,600
in the kingdom of the sands.

426
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,200
Whole generations have closed
their minds,

427
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,400
burying their heads in the sand.

428
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,610
Lift up your head from the sand.

429
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,320
Luck is fickle, here one day,
gone the next.

430
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,160
When it comes,
be ready to seize it.

431
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,400
Lift up your head, Amra.

432
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,840
Hello, Um Jamila.
Lama's birthday is this weekend.

433
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:25,400
We want a big cake, cold cuts,
some cupcakes.

434
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,210
Cookies... Lotus cookies.

435
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,850
They will be my gifts.

436
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,240
No, no gifts.
We should do this properly.

437
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,360
This is some cash for your cooking
and your time.

438
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,280
But Lama is like my child.
And you're taking Jamila to school.

439
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,360
No way. Driving her is my duty
as a neighbor.

440
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,520
For making the food and cakes,
this is your fair due.

441
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Right ! Have a nice day.

442
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,330
If we doubled the prices,

443
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:00,040
we'd make the money we need
in two months.

444
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
We need to innovate though.

445
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,520
Amra, start a new line
like those women on Instagram.

446
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,640
Sell toffee ma'moul
or pomegranate kleicha.

447
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,760
Don't you think you've overdone
the baking ?

448
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,880
- Where does the neighbor work ?
- His wife's grave's still warm.

449
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,050
I didn't ask about her.

450
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,840
Rashid works at the consultancy
that's doing the privatization.

451
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,600
They're laying off the old guard
and hiring non-nationals.

452
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,360
May God forgive him for cutting jobs.
And other things.

453
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,450
What other things ?

454
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,080
For one thing, his daughter is
at the international school.

455
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,840
- Jiji goes there too.
- No, with him it's different.

456
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,840
He's secular.

457
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,970
- Secular ?
- I get it.

458
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,120
Your star's shining.

459
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
No, I'm just asking.

460
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,760
Why are you clinging to this house ?

461
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,680
Hilal says no good,
but he says no evil.

462
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,360
And ingratitude to your husband
is a sin.

463
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,600
Ingratitude ? Again ?
When will you stop this ?

464
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,280
I'm only here for the kids.

465
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,170
They'll be lost if I leave.

466
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:18,080
- I'll go tell Mom.
- You scared me.

467
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,120
Go play this noise for her
at her soup kitchen.

468
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Take your mother and get out
of this prison cell.

469
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,560
Start a cooking business.

470
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,240
Dump the children on her.
Let the new bride take care of them.

471
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,440
That would be the best punishment.

472
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,280
Start a new life
after all these years ?

473
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,440
I'm a housewife, not a businesswoman.
And where do I go to start with ?

474
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,280
Secularists are still Muslims.
You can marry one of them.

475
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,760
Please, God, forgive me.

476
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,080
LIFT UP YOUR HEAD

477
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,920
To all disappointed ladies: rise up !

478
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,160
Subscribe to my online coaching.
Scroll down for info on that.

479
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:16,600
Why hesitate ?

480
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:21,800
I'm talking to you, the marginalized,
the broken waste of society.

481
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,200
Subscribe to my online coaching.
I'm talking to you, Amra !

482
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,200
Peace be upon you.
I am Amra.

483
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:51,240
My head is here in front of you.
Lift it up from the sands.

484
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,480
I salute you.
You're one step away

485
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,680
from lifting your head up,
getting out of the quagmire.

486
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,520
All you have to do is
make your payment.

487
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,360
Oh Lord, Holy one, bless with this soul
the union of Hilal and Ishtar.

488
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,240
Jamila, come here.

489
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,200
She's torturing her.
She'll cut her head off.

490
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,440
Is Nafisa alright ?
Good timing, Amra.

491
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:27,080
I've found someone who'll take
Nafisa's old furniture.

492
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
How generous of you.

493
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,720
- When will you come for the meat ?
- Why would I ?

494
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,240
Don't you want to give it out
to ward off the envious eye ?

495
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,290
No, darling.

496
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:50,840
The whole camp has given its blessing
for the new wedding.

497
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:55,000
The meat is for you,
to save us from your eyes.

498
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,440
Be happy for us. It is God's will.

499
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,560
Kiss Jamila for me.
She was squeamish about the blood.

500
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:10,560
Yes, I will.

501
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:15,600
What do I have
from 25 years of marriage ?

502
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,680
A useless husband
and an evil mother-in-law.

503
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,440
If a new door opens for me,
should I take it ?

504
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,840
We live in the post-truth era,
a time of flux,

505
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,160
the Trump era.

506
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:45,080
Populism is the answer.
Take the new door.

507
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,280
Make Amra great again.

508
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,280
I can't believe it.

509
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:14,440
Lama turned 13 today.
It makes me feel old.

510
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,960
Blink... and she'll be a bride.

511
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,880
Don't use the word bride.

512
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,040
Amra. You have to make tough
decisions sometimes.

513
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,840
Better to take the bitter medicine
in the short term,

514
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,040
than to be ill for the long term.

515
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,400
You have the right to resent
sharing your husband.

516
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,280
Don't sell yourself short,
afraid of what people will say.

517
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,080
Amra.

518
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
It's a big world.

519
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,920
Don't let tradition stop you making
a fresh start.

520
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,520
You still have options.

521
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,880
I'm sorry.
I have to leave now.

522
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:03,160
Congrats again to Lama.
May she enjoy her father's grace.

523
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,800
Control your mother.
Don't play dumb.

524
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,330
We can all see.

525
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,440
Your mother wants to move out
and come take my father.

526
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,600
My mother won't move out.

527
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,280
She will.

528
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,080
If your grandmother leaves,
your mother will file for divorce

529
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,090
and move out.

530
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:56,400
If she comes close to my father,
I'll make your life at school hell.

531
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,640
My heart stopped.
Give me a puff.

532
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,800
Let me drive in front of the guys.

533
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,010
You don't deserve to.

534
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,760
No one drives her but me.
She's my Darling.

535
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:19,520
That was awesome !

536
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,280
Nice one, King.

537
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,520
- King !
- Glad you liked it.

538
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,520
Alright !

539
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,920
That's what I'm talking about !

540
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,160
Today I answered him.

541
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,640
But when I did, the call dropped.

542
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,930
I'm scared.

543
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,080
Amra.

544
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,600
Seen my phone ?

545
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,210
Has she turned your head too ?

546
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:57,080
Um Saleh has a new recipe for kleicha
with orange peel.

547
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,480
You sent the money ?

548
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,000
They're privileged girls.
Born with a silver spoon.

549
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,760
She's selling you illusions
from New York.

550
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,040
They're different than us.

551
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,120
You raised us to believe that
lifting up your head breaks your neck.

552
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:17,600
New York ? Her accent's like ours.

553
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,480
You're so out of touch.

554
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,880
Where's the old furniture for sale ?

555
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,120
- Sarah, you startled me.
- Come here.

556
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,600
Tie together a lock of hair
from Hilal and Ishtar,

557
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:10,280
and throw the spell into the deep
of the ocean.

558
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:12,760
The ink on it doesn't fade.

559
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,800
How much did you pay for this heresy ?

560
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Ten months of your future kleicha sales
for God's help.

561
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,400
- I'll pay in this world and the next.
- Goodbye.

562
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,680
This is Hala calling,

563
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,520
from the Women's Association
in the capital.

564
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:11,360
We've scheduled a visit to you
tomorrow.

565
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,360
- OKkay.
- What time suits you ?

566
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,200
The morning.

567
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,800
WE ARE THE FUTURE

568
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,680
Look, Amra,
we arrange everything.

569
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,040
Transport, accommodation
for your mother and your girl.

570
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,440
We arrange a lawyer
and the press conference.

571
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,320
We force the officials
to listen to us.

572
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,560
- Who are you ?
- We're the future.

573
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:54,170
The future ?

574
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:56,880
Women's education, driving,
shura council,

575
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,170
practicing law, civil affairs,

576
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,560
they were all our demands
before they were legalized.

577
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,200
We'll soon see an end
to male guardianship.

578
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,880
I can see the future flashing
on the horizon.

579
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,440
No flashes, please.

580
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,640
Listen, at the Women's Association,

581
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:15,840
we don't only help and serve
victims of domestic abuse

582
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,520
and divorced women denied
their rights.

583
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:23,440
We also need to encourage women
to share their stories of suffering,

584
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,240
so our current becomes
the mainstream.

585
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,800
So I'll be on TV ?
Like The Dawood Show ?

586
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,400
Yes and no. There are different forms
of pressure.

587
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,960
Shock is not the same as influence.

588
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:39,200
Look, we only want your true story.

589
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,810
Tell it honestly.

590
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,320
As for us, we provide protection,
financial and psychological security.

591
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,120
And if you're afraid of retaliation
or stigma after being in the media,

592
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,000
we can move you to New Zealand
or Canada.

593
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,600
Well, that would be a last resort.

594
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,160
Amra is a lady of community.
We'll integrate her into the capital.

595
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:02,600
I just want Nafisa cared
for in a home.

596
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,760
Nafisa's case is settled.

597
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,160
We want to lift the injustice
you've suffered.

598
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,720
How could you live with
another wife ?

599
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,280
Polygamy is backward, chauvinistic,
and it makes me sick.

600
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,480
It's degrading for all women.

601
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,850
Where could I go ?

602
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:21,680
It isn't easy for a woman of my age
to start her life over.

603
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,200
What life ? They're freezing you out.

604
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:26,840
Soon they'll kick you out
of your home.

605
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,240
- What was that ?
- Don't worry.

606
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,360
It's only for internal use.

607
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,560
What if I don't want your help ?
What business is it of yours ?

608
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:40,280
There's a simple answer to that.

609
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:44,680
When slavery was abolished,

610
01:03:45,120 --> 01:03:49,240
many slaves refused to leave
their masters.

611
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,000
There can be no voting
on basic rights.

612
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:57,240
Jiji, come and say hi.

613
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,290
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

614
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,840
Everyone must be upset.
It's difficult.

615
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,160
Look, Amra, we need a decision.

616
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:16,640
Either we give you Nafisa's ticket,
or two extra ones for you and Jamila.

617
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,400
Honestly, any intelligent woman
would choose the future.

618
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:39,400
Disobedient wives are fated to be
tortured in their graves

619
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,720
and are the fuel of hell.

620
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,520
How's our beautiful bride ?

621
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,480
Are you ready for the cruise ?

622
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:47,000
Grandma, I found the hairdryer.
Let me show you where.

623
01:09:49,240 --> 01:09:51,760
Jamila, where are you ?

624
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,000
Here I am, Grandma. Hurry.

625
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:01,040
Today in Kuwait, a sentence
of capital punishment was carried out

626
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:05,600
against Nussrat El-Inizzy,
the woman who burned down

627
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:13,280
the wedding tent
of her husband and his second wife.

628
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,080
The woman involved in the incident
in 2009, Nussrat El-Inizzy,

629
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:24,480
burned the tent down with a gas tank
as revenge for her husband's marriage,

630
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,360
claiming 56 lives,

631
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:31,080
including women and children.

632
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,400
Good evening.

633
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,280
-Is this the home of...
-Al Hilal.

634
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Is this the Al Hilal residence ?

635
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:47,810
We have a subpoena.

636
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,120
We have an arrest warrant for...

637
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,970
- Hamida Bint Hilal.
- What ?

638
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:55,120
- What did she do ?
- We're investigating a cyber crime.

639
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,600
- Flaunting sinfulness.
- Crime ?

640
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:01,320
- A video on Whatsapp. What was it ?
- Land Cruiser Girl.

641
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:05,960
Jamila.
Where are you ?

642
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:11,480
- Where are you, girl ?
- One more step, Grandma.

643
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,200
- She's not here.
- Then come with us.

644
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,320
Me ? Ask her father, her guardian.

645
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:27,360
- He's at Field 14.
- A guardian isn't necessary.

646
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:31,760
Mama Nafisa ?

647
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,600
Right. Patient's name ?

648
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:44,600
Nafisa Mohammed.

649
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,520
We need her guardian to sign.
She needs urgent surgery.

650
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:52,120
- Take my ID and help the old lady.
- Great. This way, please.

651
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,280
How could you have let the poor
old woman fall in the pool ?

652
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,440
Because of your selfishness.
You're deserting us.

653
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:16,640
You chose yourself and your mother
over us. I hate you !

654
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:41,000
We can't take a road that's blocked.

655
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:45,520
Amra, this isn't the time.
My help here has no strings attached.

656
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,040
My life isn't a company
for you to restructure.

657
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:53,320
Amra. Calm down.
Let's talk tomorrow.

658
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,410
This is all your fault.

659
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:58,800
You and your consultants forced
the old employees to retire.

660
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:02,480
That promise of a check is
what made Hilal greedy.

661
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,840
Please leave us alone.

662
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:08,160
Leave you alone ?
Okay.

663
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,160
That's what you want ?

664
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,360
As you wish.

665
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:01,160
Uncle Marzouq.
I need the gas tanks refilled, please.

666
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,960
Uncle Marzouq, one of these tanks...

667
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,560
Could it burn a whole...

668
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,720
tent ?

669
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:32,000
Hearing others' misfortune
causes idle thoughts.

670
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,010
How much do I owe you ?

671
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,520
One tank can set a large group
of tents on fire in under 40 seconds.

672
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,760
Why ? Do you want to get even
with someone ?

673
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,010
The fire of vengeance

674
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,280
yields nothing but ash.

675
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,770
But if you're resolved to do it,

676
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,840
I have a dozen blowtorches
awaiting your signal.

677
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,880
I'll put it on account.
You're in distress.

678
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:04,080
Peace.

679
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:15,640
This is not acceptable.

680
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,920
What's she doing here again ?

681
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:22,080
She can't get upstairs, she's injured.

682
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:23,650
I don't care !

683
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,960
- Where can I put her ?
- The street !

684
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,520
- Give me a week.
- You have one night.

685
01:15:28,720 --> 01:15:33,200
Tomorrow morning, she's gone.
The furniture's arriving from the city.

686
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:37,440
Either get rid of your mother,
or you'll get your divorce papers.

687
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,250
I will. I will.

688
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,920
Either put your mother in a home, or
I'll see you both in a women's refuge.

689
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,730
Amra, darling.

690
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,880
- Don't stand outside. Come in.
- I'm in a hurry.

691
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,360
The ladies are collecting
for Ishtar's wedding banquet.

692
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,800
- They need your contribution.
- Where would I get any money ?

693
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,680
- I have to pay for that heresy.
- That's what I told them.

694
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:14,720
So instead, we thought
maybe you could cook the meals.

695
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,080
It'll pay you good money.

696
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:21,200
- I'd rather stay broke.
- Why the attitude ?

697
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:24,840
God is giving you this opportunity
to restore your status

698
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,490
and rejoin the camp club.

699
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,280
We'll give you back your spot.
No need for wailing and whining.

700
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:33,040
What wailing and whining ?

701
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:38,320
We're not asking for a camel !
Just some lamb and a little rice.

702
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,760
Turn your sourness into sweetness.

703
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,280
Be happy for someone else.
It's God's will.

704
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,840
I'll send the girls to get
some of your kleicha and ma'moul

705
01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:49,960
for tonight's bridal party.

706
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,640
I leave you in God's favor.

707
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,440
Wailing ? I'll show you wailing.

708
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,840
This hall is primed with gas.
It will explode in a second.

709
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,560
I get to eat dirt,
while you walk on silk ?

710
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:53,730
You're hurting me.

711
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:55,610
You go on a European cruise,

712
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,360
while I haven't set foot past
the local beach ?

713
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,560
No, we're going to the Bahamas.

714
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,360
Where's your Darling ?

715
01:18:46,240 --> 01:18:49,480
I'm hiding her until my cousins
deal with the police report.

716
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:54,520
Since this isn't the Darling,
let me drive it and do skids.

717
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:58,080
Skids, huh ? You're so funny.

718
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,840
That's what I'm talking about !

719
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,280
What did you do to the room,
you psycho ?

720
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,640
Get that out of my face and talk to me.

721
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,400
I said get rid of it.

722
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:10,000
Help me !

723
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,850
See what's happening here !

724
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,160
Amra's breaking her vow to Hilal.

725
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,320
Amra's breaking her vow to Hilal.

726
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:20,520
She has no place in Hilal's house.

727
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,400
The court will have you dragged out
by the hair like a bitch.

728
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:03,680
God Almighty,
provide us with strength.

729
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,880
Bravo. You forced him to move her
to his mother's house.

730
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,320
I didn't force anything.
Didn't we agree to cut the crap ?

731
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:20,440
Sa'adia's death changed everything.

732
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,160
That woman was evil. Now she's
more comfortable and so are we.

733
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:27,800
Sa'adia was only an excuse.
The coward hid behind her.

734
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,040
He's still marrying a girl
his daughter's age. For a son.

735
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:36,000
- Always the same with men.
- Time will heal your heart.

736
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,800
My heart is still burnt.
Let's not say "burn".

737
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,650
The ladies are anxious.

738
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:45,200
Everyone's worried that you'll set
the wedding tent on fire.

739
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,360
You wouldn't do that, would you ?

740
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:57,840
Go tell the crones that sent you:
mission accomplished.

741
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:01,410
I'd be a fool to object.

742
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:05,320
Raise your head from the sand,
they'll fill your mouth with it.

743
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:09,160
Amra, you're reasonable.
At least you got your home back.

744
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Your pots will be ready soon.

745
01:23:56,640 --> 01:24:02,360
My dear Amra, we eagerly await you
here in the nation's capital.

746
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:06,360
You'll find three airplane tickets
included.

747
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,680
Everything's arranged
for your arrival.

748
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,920
Have a safe trip.

749
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:17,880
Jiji, get ready. We need to start.

750
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,400
Please welcome
our talented student, Jamila Hilal.

751
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:42,120
The board of trustees wants to offer
a full scholarship to Jamila.

752
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,650
Jamila's a talented girl.

753
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,370
A symbol of integration.

754
01:26:46,520 --> 01:26:50,960
Our role is to remove any obstacles

755
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,400
that might distract her from focusing

756
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,520
on her academic and musical careers.

757
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:29,120
Come on, Mommy.
Let's go home.
