1
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:02,198
Seven days passed
before the world was completed.

2
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,521
lt took six days
to create the bright side,

3
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:08,079
the cozy home of the humans,

4
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:11,799
in the shadow of the mighty castle.

5
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:17,087
On the seventh day,
the dark side was created:

6
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:19,878
The sinister forest.

7
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:24,281
These two worlds
are divided by a river.

8
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:29,080
Only one bridge crosses the river.

9
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:33,926
For a long time,
no one has dared to cross it.

10
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:39,039
We all know what the bright side
of the world looks like.

11
00:01:39,449 --> 00:01:43,442
But only legends can tell us

12
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:47,398
what lurks on the dark side.

13
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:56,283
7 DWARVES

14
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:13,324
Once upon a time
there was a sweet little girl

15
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,799
known as Little Red Riding Hood.

16
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:19,007
One day, she came upon the river

17
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:22,799
which separates the world of light
from the world of shadows.

18
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,086
On the other side she saw a flower

19
00:02:26,489 --> 00:02:30,721
more alluring than any
on this side of the forbidden bridge.

20
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,520
Unable to resist temptation,

21
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:37,045
she threw caution to the wind

22
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,599
and quickly crossed over

23
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:42,284
to the dark side of the world.

24
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:45,487
Beguiled by the scent
of the blue flower,

25
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,438
she lost track of time.

26
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:12,446
lt's always time for dinner
when something interesting happens.

27
00:04:12,849 --> 00:04:15,283
l was about to invite that creature.
What was that, anyway?

28
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,998
And what's for dinner?

29
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:20,445
He saw one.
- My God.

30
00:04:20,849 --> 00:04:23,488
She breached the perimeter.
- Right in the forest.

31
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:27,279
And he saw her ...
- This must never happen again.

32
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,249
We have to teach him a lesson.
- You know the rules ...

33
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:33,038
The chair?
- The chair.

34
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:35,808
Not the chair!

35
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,127
Your Majesty! You look as fresh
as the morning dew. What am l saying?

36
00:05:44,529 --> 00:05:47,043
Fresher! As beautiful as the sunrise.

37
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:50,168
You take my breath away.

38
00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:54,198
Your delicate features are more
harmonious than a Schubert adagio.

39
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,167
A rhapsody in blonde.

40
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:59,442
Oh. Right.

41
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,002
Just wait, Your Majesty, your
skin cells are going to be like new

42
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:11,958
thanks to my
organic vegetable face mask.

43
00:06:12,369 --> 00:06:13,597
ln theory, anyway.

44
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,365
What else is new, right?
l knew a broad once:

45
00:06:17,769 --> 00:06:22,604
Skin like an old tire, airbags under
her eyes and hair like straw.

46
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,843
Your Majesty! The word beauty
should carry your name!

47
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,523
Your Majesty!

48
00:06:28,929 --> 00:06:30,362
l know, Spliss.

49
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,280
Boys, that's enough.

50
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,318
Bubi, there is another world.
Beyond the bridge.

51
00:06:42,729 --> 00:06:45,243
Are there more of these
creatures with no willy?

52
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:52,288
A ladle of nettle soup
with sorrel dumplings and coltsfoot?

53
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,962
Yes, Bubi, there are.

54
00:06:57,369 --> 00:06:59,929
They're called ''women.''
And women are dangerous.

55
00:07:00,609 --> 00:07:03,043
lf you ever see one again,
run for your life.

56
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:04,962
Okay.
- You hear?

57
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,638
As fast as you possibly can.
- Yeah!

58
00:07:11,049 --> 00:07:14,439
That one seemed so nice, though.
l'd like to play with her.

59
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,318
Bubi, this is not a game. - lf women
are nice, it's to trick you.

60
00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:20,923
Tshakko is right.

61
00:07:21,329 --> 00:07:23,479
Remember what your mother did to you?

62
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,323
What?
- Your parents were bank robbers.

63
00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:27,878
Bank robbers?

64
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:35,479
You'll never catch us!

65
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,438
Damn! They've hit us!

66
00:07:42,849 --> 00:07:44,726
We're going down.

67
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,689
We need to lose some weight!
- What?

68
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,200
Yes!

69
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:10,567
That was fun.
- No, it wasn't.

70
00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:12,800
Women are heartless and cold.

71
00:08:13,209 --> 00:08:17,885
Stupid cows! Always in a shitty mood!
Bunch of know-it-alls.

72
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,486
You can't generalize like that.
- Sure l can:

73
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:24,961
Women are know-it-alls. Period.

74
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:26,961
l think

75
00:08:27,369 --> 00:08:31,123
everyone has a good side, even women.

76
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:33,042
Sure they do. Their back.

77
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,801
ln any case, they break your heart.

78
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:39,125
l used to be a happy man.

79
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:41,326
l used to be a happy man.

80
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,923
Until THAT night ...

81
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:45,160
Until THAT night ...

82
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,720
... that changed my life.

83
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,006
... that changed my life.

84
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:52,764
But let's not talk about it.

85
00:08:59,729 --> 00:09:01,242
Are you making fun of me?

86
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:03,765
Come on ...
- No way ...

87
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,080
My misery amuses you?

88
00:09:06,489 --> 00:09:08,320
No, no.
- Not at all.

89
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:11,926
So what happened THAT night?

90
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,726
Who knows, he never talks about it.

91
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,644
ln any event, we have to destroy
the bridge to the outside world.

92
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:22,200
Who knows what might show up next?

93
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:48,838
Ralfie!

94
00:09:49,249 --> 00:09:50,318
Can l come in?

95
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,006
Look! A real pointy cap.
l made it myself. Can l join you now?

96
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:57,842
There's already seven of us.

97
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:01,605
Well then ...
- Well then, piss off. - Wait!

98
00:10:03,449 --> 00:10:08,079
l sort of like him.
- You sort of like Godzilla.

99
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,119
To the bridge, boys.

100
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:20,565
Hey, dwarves! Hey, dwarves!
Hey, dwarves, ho!

101
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:23,159
Hey, dwarves!
Hey, dwarves! Go, go, go!

102
00:10:42,489 --> 00:10:45,003
Let's get this over with.

103
00:10:46,209 --> 00:10:48,006
Jester! A jest!

104
00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:51,602
What's this, your Majesty?

105
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:57,248
A brunette holding on to a thought.

106
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:03,081
And what do you see
when you look into a brunette's eyes?

107
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:05,207
The back of her skull.

108
00:11:07,969 --> 00:11:11,484
What does one brunette say another
as she looks at herself in the mirror?

109
00:11:11,889 --> 00:11:13,766
''Hey, l know that face.''

110
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:21,840
The other one takes the mirror
and goes: ''Sure! That's me!''

111
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,841
Yes!

112
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:55,561
Mirror, mirror on the wall,

113
00:11:55,969 --> 00:12:00,247
Who's the fairest of them all?

114
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,204
Yes, hello there ...

115
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:06,645
l'm not sure if you knew ...

116
00:12:07,049 --> 00:12:09,802
but you're the fairest here.

117
00:12:11,209 --> 00:12:13,359
Although ... l mean ...

118
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,327
there might be ...

119
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:17,481
quite possibly ... someone else.

120
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,368
And that would be Snow White.

121
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:23,646
Snow White!

122
00:12:24,049 --> 00:12:25,482
Well, she is ...

123
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,164
l don't want to say
more beautiful ...

124
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:33,006
But actually, she sort of is.

125
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:35,320
Snow White!

126
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:40,245
l mean, come on.
The girl's got it going on!

127
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:45,677
lf l weren't stuck
in this damn mirror. Whoa, boy!

128
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:47,518
Spliss!

129
00:12:48,489 --> 00:12:51,128
She's alive! That bitch of a brunette!

130
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,649
What did l tell you to do THAT night?

131
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:01,999
But Your Majesty,
l personally disposed of the child.

132
00:13:02,409 --> 00:13:05,560
l put her
in the best orphanage in town.

133
00:13:08,249 --> 00:13:13,039
That's not quite
what l meant by ''dispose of.''

134
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,008
BRUNETTES

135
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:21,008
Do l have to do everything myself?
Security! Go! Find her!

136
00:13:26,249 --> 00:13:28,604
And you ... l'll talk to you later.

137
00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:09,159
l hope Gaby is pretty enough
for her fairy-tale prince.

138
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,241
Oh, there he is.

139
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:17,968
Hello, my prince.

140
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:23,159
Your hair is especially gorgeous
today. Give your princess a kiss.

141
00:14:24,729 --> 00:14:25,764
Another one.

142
00:14:26,809 --> 00:14:29,801
Oh, Ben, you savage, you.

143
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:32,006
Yes, hello there ...

144
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:34,479
l'm not sure if you knew ...

145
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,484
but we got a bit of a problem.
A teensy-weensy one.

146
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:40,527
Ah, yes.

147
00:14:43,729 --> 00:14:47,768
No, you're the one with the ...
teensy-weensy problem.

148
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,081
There's a certain lady ...

149
00:14:52,489 --> 00:14:57,722
l don't want to mention any names ...
The Queen ...

150
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:01,519
And she is ... l don't want to say
annoyed with you ...

151
00:15:01,929 --> 00:15:03,487
but she basically ...

152
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:05,798
hates your guts.

153
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:10,122
Really? Now what?

154
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:13,601
Well, what do you think?

155
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:22,244
Oh, l see. You want me to vanish.

156
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:34,763
The bridge has to go.
lt's the only way into the forest.

157
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:38,798
Let's hear some constructive ideas.

158
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,643
l'd say ...
- What's the problem, boys?

159
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:45,644
This is a piece of cake.
l'll get my nitroglycerine cocktail

160
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:50,518
and, bang, it's gone. Like the time
we went fishing last year.

161
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,769
Okay, it still needs some fine tuning.

162
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,921
l thought it was fun.

163
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:08,087
Cloudy, stop slapping Bubi around.
That's my job.

164
00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:28,048
The dollhouse
is all we found of the slut.

165
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:30,326
What?
- Slut!

166
00:16:30,729 --> 00:16:33,084
Butt! Good idea. Put out the butt.

167
00:16:34,209 --> 00:16:36,882
Now l want to see the hunter or else:
a black eye!

168
00:16:37,689 --> 00:16:38,804
Hunter or black eye!

169
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,485
Black eye, not black guy!

170
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:46,688
Morning.

171
00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:51,843
Hunter. Where is your bloodhound?

172
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:55,844
Say what?
- The bloodhound, woolly-faced one.

173
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,080
She wants Brutus.

174
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,759
Listen, hunter ...

175
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,918
Snow White ...

176
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:16,600
Who?

177
00:17:16,729 --> 00:17:18,924
Could someone please ...

178
00:17:19,009 --> 00:17:22,638
turn off these stupid trumpets?

179
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,322
Oh. Right.

180
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,603
Bring me that bitch, hunter.

181
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:50,962
Snow White.

182
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,563
Dead.

183
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:58,806
No. Better yet: Alive!

184
00:17:59,209 --> 00:18:00,688
Uh-huh. Not dead?

185
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:03,523
Oh no, beardo.

186
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:06,682
For there is a fate worse than death.

187
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:07,999
Whoa.

188
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:14,801
That's it.
l've had it, time for plan B!

189
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:39,924
KEEP OUT

190
00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:54,726
l've got something as well.

191
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:07,961
The excitement is killing me.

192
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:11,679
Smells weird. What's that?
- My catapult.

193
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:13,647
Boring!

194
00:19:14,849 --> 00:19:20,003
Everyone who wants to cross the bridge
gets a full load.

195
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,162
l'll show you a catapult!
- That's so boring.

196
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,448
He's not laughing.

197
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:30,558
He must really be bored.
Go play in the forest.

198
00:19:32,729 --> 00:19:37,086
Not too far! l'm about to make dinner.
- Go as far as you can.

199
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:41,841
This is the trigger-triggering-cord.

200
00:19:42,929 --> 00:19:45,318
lt triggers the trigger.

201
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:47,685
You just pull the horseshoe.

202
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,565
lt was working fine yesterday.

203
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:56,163
Oh boy!

204
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:58,480
l can't watch this.
Give me the damn thing.

205
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,927
That wasn't by any chance ...?

206
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,759
Freshly harvested this morning.

207
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,921
l look like a pig.

208
00:20:15,329 --> 00:20:17,524
True. And you're covered in muck.

209
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:29,599
First l muck everything up,
and then l have to clean it, too.

210
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,045
lt's just not fair.

211
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:37,164
Speedy! The soap!

212
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:40,439
One day they'll thank me.

213
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:42,928
Thank you!

214
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,362
l knew it!

215
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:21,717
Screw this.

216
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,007
Stop! Hold it right there.

217
00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:46,206
Don't come any closer.
- Whoa.

218
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,043
l am one of the infamous dwarves.

219
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:52,361
A dwarf?
l thought dwarves were smaller.

220
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,600
Yes. Of course.

221
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:58,124
That's it.

222
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:01,965
Smaller.

223
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:05,327
l knew l was doing something wrong.
- Moron.

224
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,004
Stop! Cut it out!

225
00:23:18,409 --> 00:23:20,604
We're supposed to be chasing tail.

226
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:24,123
Who are you?
- Who are you?

227
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,838
l asked first.
Who are you? l'm a dwarf.

228
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:31,561
Another one. At least
you're smaller than the last one.

229
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:34,763
Have you seen a girl run by here?

230
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:37,888
Skin as white as the fallen snow?
- Yes.

231
00:23:38,289 --> 00:23:39,961
And lips as red as blood?
- Yes.

232
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:42,041
And hair as black as ebony?
- Yes.

233
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:43,768
Nope, sure haven't.

234
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:47,525
l see.
Well then. Keep your eyes peeled.

235
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:54,084
Snow White. What kind of name is that?

236
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:56,764
We'll catch her.
Brutus can catch anything.

237
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,639
The other day he caught rabies.

238
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,724
Rabies, right on. What else can he do?
- He can fetch.

239
00:24:05,129 --> 00:24:06,608
How fetching.
- l'll say.

240
00:24:07,009 --> 00:24:10,684
Show the dwarf

241
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:13,364
how well you fetch.

242
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,487
Watch this.

243
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:24,128
He's fetching.

244
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:32,244
Well fetched, Brutus.

245
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:36,244
That's a twelve-pointer.

246
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:41,084
That's going in my collection.

247
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:45,160
You should see it.
l've done a lot of shooting.

248
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,686
And l always hit something.
Wonderful trophies.

249
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:53,206
Well done. You deserve a reward.
When l say ''go'',

250
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:55,565
you can make a wish.
When l say ''stop,'' it's over. Okay?

251
00:24:55,969 --> 00:24:58,199
Go. Stop. Sorry.
Now l'm going to make a wish:

252
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:01,123
A doggy song!

253
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:04,805
When you hold him in your arm,
doggy's feeling nice and warm. - Stop.

254
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:09,168
When you scratch his little ear, doggy
sighs, as you can hear. - Must go!

255
00:25:09,569 --> 00:25:13,528
When you poke his little nose,
doggy's hurting, and it shows. - Yes!

256
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:17,399
When you twist his little tail,
doggy's gonna cry and wail. - Wailing.

257
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,562
When you kick him in the butt,
then he'll squeal, the little mutt.

258
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:24,757
We all know for what this calls:
Let's cut off the doggy's ...

259
00:25:26,809 --> 00:25:30,961
l'm not done! After he is skinned
alive, we end our little doggy-jive.

260
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:39,681
Who left the door open?

261
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:52,683
Bubi, are you there?

262
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,959
Who ate my coltsfoot soup?

263
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:10,999
And who ... - Who put
this pretty doll on my chair?

264
00:26:11,409 --> 00:26:14,765
And who ...
- What idiot hung his dirty coat here?

265
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:18,684
And who ...
- Who took my bearskin?

266
00:26:19,089 --> 00:26:20,841
And who's that lying in my bed?

267
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:28,642
Bubi?

268
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,799
A woman!

269
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,567
Calm down, boys.

270
00:26:38,969 --> 00:26:41,767
We'll get to the bottom of this.

271
00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:44,038
Think it through. Step by step.

272
00:26:44,449 --> 00:26:46,519
ls there some higher power
working against us?

273
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,446
ls there even such a thing
as a higher power?

274
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,366
Does anyone have a clue
who she might be?

275
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:57,885
l know! l know!

276
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,681
Wanted: Snow White.

277
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,966
A reward!

278
00:27:07,369 --> 00:27:10,247
Hello? l'm Snow White.

279
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:50,757
And who are you?

280
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:53,881
We're the seven dwarves.

281
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:58,077
Really?
l thought dwarves were smaller.

282
00:27:58,489 --> 00:28:00,002
Most people do.

283
00:28:00,409 --> 00:28:01,967
A common misconception.

284
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:04,439
Wait! Wait! Wait!
- What?

285
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:10,927
Here.
- My dollhouse. That's so sweet.

286
00:28:16,449 --> 00:28:19,407
But now l have to ...
- Now she has to ...

287
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:21,925
You scared her off.
- Him and his reward!

288
00:28:22,329 --> 00:28:25,287
We have to stop her! Follow me.
- Right now?

289
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:26,724
Wait! Wait! Wait!

290
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:30,405
l really have to ... - l'll make you
a glass noodle pudding.

291
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,606
You can sleep in my bed, if you like.

292
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:36,638
l have to ...
- We're nice guys, really.

293
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,721
Great, but l have to ...
- l'll come with you.

294
00:28:39,169 --> 00:28:40,807
Thank you, but that's impossible.

295
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,564
How courageous.
Where will you go, all by yourself?

296
00:28:43,969 --> 00:28:45,197
l really have to go!

297
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,479
You're acting like a bunch of fools.

298
00:28:51,889 --> 00:28:53,288
We're just faking. For the reward.

299
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:59,004
Excuse me? There's no toilet paper.
Could someone go get some?

300
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:13,201
We have a problem.

301
00:29:16,009 --> 00:29:18,079
There's only one man who can help.

302
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,638
Yes.

303
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:54,128
Yeah, whaddya want?

304
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:58,159
White Helge! Wisest of the Wise!

305
00:29:58,729 --> 00:30:01,687
We are the seven dwarves.
And we have a problem.

306
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:05,923
Right.
Just toss the ring into the fire.

307
00:30:08,689 --> 00:30:11,044
But we don't have a ring.
We have Snow White.

308
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:15,078
Then throw Snow White into the fire.

309
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:18,401
We can't throw Snow White
into the fire.

310
00:30:18,809 --> 00:30:23,678
Well. That's a problem all right.

311
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:26,046
Great, thanks a lot, White Helge ...

312
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,485
Oh, don't mention it ...

313
00:30:29,489 --> 00:30:30,604
See ya.

314
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,124
Pompous ass.

315
00:30:36,689 --> 00:30:39,123
ldiot. Schmuck.

316
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:46,366
Are you nuts?
Stop it, you filthy mutt.

317
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:49,727
Seek, seek, seek,
we're playing hide and seek!

318
00:30:50,129 --> 00:30:53,519
Beat, beat, beat,
we're playing hide and beat!

319
00:30:59,169 --> 00:31:00,363
Hello!

320
00:31:02,729 --> 00:31:04,367
l have a new cap.

321
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:07,646
And l'm not as tall anymore.

322
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:14,719
Okay, okay.
You're already seven, right?

323
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:17,678
All right then...

324
00:31:23,009 --> 00:31:26,001
Seek, seek, seek ...

325
00:31:26,409 --> 00:31:27,398
Excuse me?

326
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,408
What are you doing?

327
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:34,484
Nothing. Just playing Hide-and-Beat.
- l thought this was Dwarfcheckers.

328
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:36,117
Never heard of it.

329
00:31:36,529 --> 00:31:39,282
lt's a board game.
We beat one another with a board.

330
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:45,281
What if someone falls? - Then you say
''Check.'' - Do you know Dwarfopoly?

331
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:48,965
lt's another board game. - Each player
whacks the others with a board.

332
00:31:49,369 --> 00:31:51,325
Or Double or Hits?
- Let me guess:

333
00:31:51,729 --> 00:31:54,721
You hit each other with a board ...
- Nonsense, you underestimate us.

334
00:31:55,129 --> 00:32:00,157
lt's way more complex. Everyone
gets TWO boards to hit the others...

335
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:02,318
Check!

336
00:32:03,609 --> 00:32:04,644
Snow White.

337
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:08,723
l need to talk to you.

338
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:17,008
We have a problem.

339
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:21,687
l can learn. The games seem
pretty easy. - No, that's not it.

340
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:25,126
You know,
being a dwarf is a serious business.

341
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:28,885
We're dwarves out of conviction.

342
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:34,488
lt's a way of looking at the world. We
made a decision to live without women.

343
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:36,038
Most of us

344
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:40,806
have been hurt by a woman.
Everyone has his story.

345
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,281
l, for example, lost my beloved wife.

346
00:32:44,689 --> 00:32:48,477
Life had lost all meaning for me.

347
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:53,519
l'd rather not talk about it.
- You don't have to. - l've changed.

348
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:57,126
lt's really none of my business.
- l've never talked about it ...

349
00:32:57,529 --> 00:33:00,487
Then don't.
- l lost everything.

350
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:04,802
But then a door opened,
and brought light into my darkness.

351
00:33:05,209 --> 00:33:09,521
l placed an ad,
looking for like-minded folks.

352
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,564
''Fed up with life and women?

353
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:18,202
Join the Seven Dwarves Project.''

354
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:22,159
And these seven guys replied?

355
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:25,163
Oh, no. Far more than that.

356
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:26,878
Eight.

357
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:34,764
One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six.

358
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:36,363
Seven.

359
00:33:39,969 --> 00:33:42,358
Some who didn't make it
never got over it.

360
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:45,728
Not every man can be a dwarf.

361
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:49,166
And not every dwarf
can be a fairy-tale prince.

362
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,321
l think you underestimate my boys.

363
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,606
You think so?

364
00:33:59,009 --> 00:34:02,558
We still have an issue, though.
We can't live with you in one house.

365
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:04,448
We can solve this.

366
00:35:15,729 --> 00:35:16,878
Check!

367
00:35:38,009 --> 00:35:41,638
So you did not bring her here,

368
00:35:42,049 --> 00:35:44,040
as specifically requested
by your queen?

369
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:46,246
What are you, nuts?

370
00:35:46,649 --> 00:35:47,923
This is a scandal.

371
00:35:48,329 --> 00:35:53,483
A mutiny! What happened to
that bitch of a brunette?

372
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:57,325
Well, she's ... dead.
- Yeah?

373
00:35:57,729 --> 00:36:00,527
lt was him. He ate her.

374
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,885
He ate her? All gone?

375
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:07,521
Not a shred left.
Tore her into tiny pieces.

376
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:10,921
Oh, goody. All right, then.
- Yes.

377
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:20,086
Coltsfoot on a bed of nettle, with
blackthorn dressing. You earned this.

378
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:22,605
Really? How?
- Hot wieners!

379
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:24,408
Yes!

380
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,887
So you all have problems with women?

381
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:39,205
Nonsense. Says who?

382
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:44,000
l've heard that you've all been hurt.

383
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:48,118
l'm listening.

384
00:36:48,529 --> 00:36:49,359
Speedy?

385
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:50,838
Tshakko?

386
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:52,964
Sunny?

387
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:54,768
Cloudy?

388
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,080
Yes, Bubi.
What would you like to share?

389
00:36:58,489 --> 00:36:59,638
Nothing.

390
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:02,040
Mrs. Billerbeck.
- Sorry?

391
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:07,204
You remind me of my teacher.
Mrs. Billerbeck. That bitch.

392
00:37:07,609 --> 00:37:11,648
She had her good sides.
- Really? Remember the stupid play?

393
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:14,804
The parts were perfect for us.

394
00:37:15,209 --> 00:37:19,566
The three happy piggies
and the big, bad wolf.

395
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:25,798
Three little piggies, that's
what l am, and l'm happy as a clam.

396
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:29,406
Three little piggies is what we are,
and we're feeling wunderbar!

397
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:31,443
Woo-hoo!

398
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:37,526
l'm the wolf, l'm big, l'm bad.
l'm gonna huff and puff like mad.

399
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:39,760
With a mighty roar and thunder,

400
00:37:40,169 --> 00:37:44,128
Piggy town is going under.

401
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:46,408
Oh. The horror.

402
00:37:46,809 --> 00:37:47,844
Stop!

403
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,007
My God! Not a shred of talent!

404
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:53,402
Get out!

405
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,559
And so the bitch kicked us out.

406
00:37:56,969 --> 00:38:00,006
Maybe you should have switched roles.

407
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:02,800
Me? The big, bad wolf?

408
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:06,323
And me ... the three little pigs?

409
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:09,843
All right, here is my story:

410
00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:16,767
l once met a girl.
She was a real hottie.

411
00:38:17,489 --> 00:38:21,562
And l'm thinking: ''Go for it.''

412
00:38:22,569 --> 00:38:25,561
But the thing was

413
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:28,119
she lived way up high.

414
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:30,599
But hey, l'm not from foolsville.

415
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,967
See, she had these two long braids.

416
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:37,361
So l just climbed up one of them.

417
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:38,838
Howdy.

418
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:46,005
And l was in love!

419
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,162
That must have hurt.
- Nah, wasn't that high.

420
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:52,641
Maybe you should have been quicker.

421
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:54,801
Quicker?

422
00:38:55,529 --> 00:38:56,928
Ah ...

423
00:38:58,609 --> 00:38:59,803
Quicker!

424
00:39:00,209 --> 00:39:01,722
Quicker. Got it.

425
00:39:02,129 --> 00:39:04,404
l'll make it quick.
No lengthy introductions.

426
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,640
l found a magic lamp ...

427
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:09,165
at a beach once.

428
00:39:15,209 --> 00:39:16,881
A lamp!

429
00:39:17,289 --> 00:39:19,325
A beautiful lamp!

430
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:23,249
Well, what do we have here?

431
00:39:23,649 --> 00:39:26,880
A beautiful magic lamp.

432
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:29,928
Yes, it is. My lamp.

433
00:39:32,689 --> 00:39:34,805
That was the chance of a lifetime.

434
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:38,485
The magic lamp
could have solved all your problems.

435
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:44,327
What do l need a lamp for?
My problem is that l can't hit women.

436
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:49,562
You lost. You didn't say ''Check.''

437
00:39:49,969 --> 00:39:52,847
Not fair! l didn't even ...

438
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:54,364
Stop it!

439
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:56,964
Lost! Lost! Lost!
- Would you shut up?

440
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:00,717
Check.

441
00:40:03,209 --> 00:40:04,961
l think l hit a woman.

442
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,325
l hit a woman!

443
00:40:21,009 --> 00:40:22,727
Yes, hello again.

444
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:27,407
l think l know what this is about.
And YOU are the prettiest!

445
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:29,964
Although ...

446
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,085
on a more global level ...

447
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:38,277
What?
l am the fairest in all the land.

448
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,487
Well. ''All the land'' ...

449
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:44,926
might be a teensy exaggeration.

450
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:48,926
Okay, if we exclude the forest ...

451
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:54,968
then, fine. But ...

452
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,758
beyond the seven hills,
we got the seven dwarves ...

453
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:03,126
and they do have a certain person
in their midst ...

454
00:41:04,009 --> 00:41:05,078
Snow White.

455
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:10,324
You could, of course, ignore her.
But why?

456
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:14,085
Why can't brunettes
write the number 77?

457
00:41:14,489 --> 00:41:17,799
They don't know which 7 comes first.

458
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,401
Hunter or a black eye.

459
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:27,367
The hunter!

460
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:37,168
There he is, our good hunter,
who helped us get rid of the brunette.

461
00:41:37,569 --> 00:41:40,163
Rid of the brunette.

462
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:43,641
Brutus tore her to shreds.

463
00:41:44,049 --> 00:41:47,007
Tiny pieces.
- Tiny pieces.

464
00:41:47,409 --> 00:41:50,321
That's right, isn't it, hunter?
- Yes, ma'am.

465
00:41:50,729 --> 00:41:52,447
What do you take me for?

466
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:54,726
What do you take her for?

467
00:41:55,129 --> 00:41:58,644
Don't lie to me! Or at least
lie better! - Lie better!

468
00:41:59,129 --> 00:42:00,403
Security!

469
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:04,518
No!

470
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:07,523
Not hilarity! Security!

471
00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:11,567
Ah, security.

472
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:16,398
Starting tomorrow,
l'll be handling this myself.

473
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,003
What do you have in mind?

474
00:42:18,409 --> 00:42:23,164
Just wait.
You'll find out soon enough.

475
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:37,199
Well, my prince. Your princess
is going to bed. Say good night.

476
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:40,123
No, l'm sleeping on top.
- No, me.

477
00:42:41,129 --> 00:42:45,964
l'd like to. - No, let me!
- Guys, let me.

478
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:50,443
No, no, no, l'm the oldest.
- Yes, but l'm stronger.

479
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:52,407
And l'm weaker.

480
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:54,959
You'll break my back.

481
00:42:58,489 --> 00:43:01,162
l've just about had it.

482
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:14,200
Yes, one more.

483
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:16,122
Another kiss.

484
00:43:17,129 --> 00:43:21,486
Now l really have to go beddy-bye.
lt's my 18th birthday tomorrow.

485
00:43:21,889 --> 00:43:25,040
Do you think l'll find my prince?

486
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:27,963
You'll find him. No problem.

487
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:34,725
He's much closer than you think.
He's the one who sleeps on top.

488
00:43:36,929 --> 00:43:38,681
Me! - Me!
- Me! - Hey!

489
00:43:39,089 --> 00:43:42,525
l know something. lf you want me to
tell, you have to let me sleep on top.

490
00:43:42,929 --> 00:43:45,682
We'll have to know if it's worth it.

491
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,924
lf l have the top bed, l'll tell you:
lt's Snow White's birthday tomorrow.

492
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:57,561
All right, you lousy blackmailer.
You got something there. Give.

493
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,120
Snow White's 18th birthday
is tomorrow.

494
00:44:01,529 --> 00:44:04,566
Well, ain't that something?
- Let's throw a party.

495
00:44:04,969 --> 00:44:06,448
A surprise party.

496
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,840
With fireworks.
- And plenty to eat.

497
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,318
Count me out.

498
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,124
Maybe Snow White'll cook for you.

499
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:19,007
She can't cook
at her own surprise party.

500
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,922
l don't care.

501
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:23,843
l banned wieners for a reason.

502
00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:25,921
Cooky!

503
00:44:27,009 --> 00:44:30,126
Your haute cuisine
made our palates susceptible

504
00:44:30,529 --> 00:44:34,442
to more basic pleasures,
such as wieners.

505
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:39,368
So you enjoyed my cooking?

506
00:44:39,769 --> 00:44:42,283
No, but who else is dumb enough
to cook for us?

507
00:44:44,729 --> 00:44:46,128
Wait a minute.

508
00:44:46,529 --> 00:44:50,238
lsn't tomorrow the anniversary of ...

509
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:52,237
Don't say it.

510
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:54,441
What?
- ''THAT night''.

511
00:44:58,529 --> 00:44:59,882
That's odd.

512
00:45:00,889 --> 00:45:03,403
Her 18th birthday ...

513
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,365
and his 18th anniversary ...

514
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:11,280
What an odd coincidence.

515
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:12,758
Small world.

516
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:18,163
We're having a fancy dress. l'll wear
nothing except black gloves and shoes.

517
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:21,959
l'll be ... - What's all this?
- The five of spades.

518
00:45:22,369 --> 00:45:24,121
Ah, five of spades.

519
00:45:27,769 --> 00:45:30,363
A party on the anniversary
of my misery!

520
00:45:41,689 --> 00:45:47,002
Once upon a time ...

521
00:45:49,489 --> 00:45:56,088
happiness was mine.

522
00:45:57,489 --> 00:46:01,038
Why did it ever leave my side?

523
00:46:01,449 --> 00:46:05,203
l lost everything that night.

524
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:12,401
Once upon a time ...

525
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:16,640
l was hers

526
00:46:17,049 --> 00:46:20,086
and she was mine.

527
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:25,078
Now l sit at home, bitter and alone.

528
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:28,925
ls there any happiness in sight?

529
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,048
The kind l once knew

530
00:46:32,449 --> 00:46:41,767
before that night?

531
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:07,443
Your Majesty looks enchanting.
Ravishing. And this lovely outfit!

532
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:09,680
Nonsense,
l look just as horrid as you.

533
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:13,681
Come on, we're going into the forest.
- The forest?

534
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,683
Put on this hat.
- Hat?

535
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:19,319
And wear this beard.
- Beard?

536
00:47:19,729 --> 00:47:23,517
Don't forget the Tupperware container.
- Tupperware container.

537
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:26,358
Tupperware container?

538
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:29,761
What do you see when you look
into the Queen's eyes?

539
00:47:30,169 --> 00:47:31,887
The back of her skull.

540
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:34,962
Great joke, eh? The best jest ever!

541
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:38,805
Ready for another one?
This one's even better.

542
00:47:39,209 --> 00:47:42,838
What do you call it
when the Queen is wearing ear plugs?

543
00:47:43,249 --> 00:47:45,604
Filling the void!

544
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:49,638
And what makes her laugh
in the morning?

545
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:53,086
Last night's joke.
- Hold it.

546
00:47:53,489 --> 00:47:56,401
l tell the jokes around here.
- Not anymore. Your queen has risen.

547
00:47:57,289 --> 00:47:59,723
And what rhymes with ''risen''?

548
00:48:00,129 --> 00:48:01,118
No idea.

549
00:48:01,529 --> 00:48:02,200
Prison!

550
00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:06,407
At least you can smoke there.

551
00:48:31,969 --> 00:48:34,324
Yeah, sure, okay.

552
00:48:40,649 --> 00:48:45,404
Do l have to do everything myself?
Where is the Tupperware container?

553
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,044
Tupperware container.

554
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:15,522
Good morning.

555
00:49:15,929 --> 00:49:17,078
Wipe your feet.

556
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:22,998
Where is everyone?

557
00:49:23,409 --> 00:49:26,958
l can't say.
- And why?

558
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:28,688
Because l don't want to.

559
00:49:29,089 --> 00:49:32,525
Fine.
l wanted to talk to you in private.

560
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:35,602
Would you share
some of your recipes with me?

561
00:49:37,089 --> 00:49:40,638
ls this a joke?
- No, why?

562
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:44,121
l like them. Are they your Mom's?

563
00:49:44,529 --> 00:49:47,839
No. My Mom had different recipes.

564
00:49:48,649 --> 00:49:53,279
l remember making
wheatgrass mousse with buckthorn brew

565
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:57,728
and sun-dried sunflower seeds for her.
To which she said:

566
00:49:58,129 --> 00:50:00,802
Get that slop away from me.

567
00:50:05,689 --> 00:50:07,600
That's how it was.

568
00:50:08,009 --> 00:50:12,366
No one likes my food.
- Conceptually, it's not bad.

569
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:15,602
Your cuisine just lacks
a certain touch at times.

570
00:50:16,009 --> 00:50:18,079
A touch of wiener, for example.

571
00:50:19,089 --> 00:50:20,602
What's that supposed to be?

572
00:50:22,209 --> 00:50:23,881
Wait a minute.

573
00:50:25,289 --> 00:50:27,723
Wieners in yarrow crust.

574
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:30,404
Wieners with herbs and leeks.

575
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:33,369
Wieners with burnet and parsnip roots.

576
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,886
Sounds delicious.
- Wieners don't have to be boring.

577
00:50:37,289 --> 00:50:39,200
No.
- Wieners can be exciting.

578
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:40,564
Right.

579
00:50:41,929 --> 00:50:43,601
l have to try this at your ...

580
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:48,329
l mean, at some point.

581
00:50:49,769 --> 00:50:51,725
Excuse me.

582
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:04,764
You can do so much with a tomato.

583
00:51:05,169 --> 00:51:06,761
Such as?

584
00:51:09,129 --> 00:51:11,438
l knew it.
- You're having a party without me?

585
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,281
So you are cooking after all?

586
00:51:15,689 --> 00:51:16,758
Of course.

587
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:22,483
l thought of something special.
Plantain rolls with herb dumplings.

588
00:51:22,889 --> 00:51:25,403
Plantain rolls?

589
00:51:25,809 --> 00:51:27,128
With wild mushrooms.

590
00:51:27,529 --> 00:51:29,963
l'll get them!
- What do you know about mushrooms?

591
00:51:30,369 --> 00:51:34,123
Nothing. - You can't be too careful.
Go with him.

592
00:51:34,529 --> 00:51:36,679
And take the ''Big Book of Mushrooms''!

593
00:51:37,409 --> 00:51:38,728
What goes with mushrooms?

594
00:51:39,129 --> 00:51:41,768
How about ...
- Venison ragout!

595
00:51:43,569 --> 00:51:44,763
No, we're having ...

596
00:51:45,169 --> 00:51:47,319
Wieners!

597
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:59,721
A classic gem:
The ''blue-and-yellow copulator.''

598
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:06,284
You can recognize it
by its blue tip and yellow stem.

599
00:52:07,329 --> 00:52:13,404
lt used to be a popular aphrodisiac,

600
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:20,160
though the arousing effect
is short-lived.

601
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:25,799
The ''fiery throat fungus''
is considered especially delicious.

602
00:52:26,649 --> 00:52:30,324
But only for wild animals.

603
00:52:30,729 --> 00:52:33,243
ln humans, it causes

604
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:37,528
an unbearable irritation
in the throat.

605
00:52:38,529 --> 00:52:40,997
lngesting fluids ...

606
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:43,798
enhances the effect.

607
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:51,808
The burning can be stopped
by ingesting a ''common 'shroom.''

608
00:52:53,569 --> 00:52:59,485
Which can, however,
lead to visions and hallucinations.

609
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:15,159
Your Majesty, this is illegal.

610
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:20,484
Of course kidnapping is illegal.
And the beard has got to go.

611
00:53:22,529 --> 00:53:24,485
A horseshoe.

612
00:53:24,889 --> 00:53:26,402
A good luck charm.

613
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:43,005
My God, you smell like a pig.
And you're covered in muck.

614
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:54,760
Don't tell Brummboss, don't tell Snow
White, we're having a party tonight!

615
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:02,167
Wieners, kraut and beer galore ...

616
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:04,525
Till you can peel us off the floor!

617
00:54:12,729 --> 00:54:14,208
You're throwing a party?

618
00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:18,045
On the anniversary of THAT night?

619
00:54:18,689 --> 00:54:20,566
No. Where did you get that idea?

620
00:54:20,969 --> 00:54:22,960
This isn't a party.

621
00:54:24,329 --> 00:54:27,366
Where do you want the fireworks?

622
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:32,520
Okay, maybe it's a tiny little party.

623
00:54:32,929 --> 00:54:34,760
Snow White is turning 18 today.

624
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,884
18?

625
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:46,722
l knew it.

626
00:54:47,129 --> 00:54:48,608
l knew it the moment l saw her.

627
00:54:49,009 --> 00:54:53,639
When your caps stood up and
mine didn't. You know what that means?

628
00:54:54,369 --> 00:54:58,521
Doesn't mean anything.
That's normal for men your age.

629
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:00,282
What are you standing around for?

630
00:55:00,689 --> 00:55:02,441
We have a party to prepare!

631
00:55:05,049 --> 00:55:09,088
Bring on the Chianti and Frascati,
we're gonna have ourselves a party!

632
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,961
Come on, come on.

633
00:55:20,809 --> 00:55:23,164
What? Two addresses?

634
00:55:24,809 --> 00:55:28,085
Two doors?
- l can see that. - l beg your pardon.

635
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:29,808
How do l look?

636
00:55:30,209 --> 00:55:32,484
Unrecognizable, my quee ...

637
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:36,484
From now on l'm Mr. King!
- Mr. King, of course.

638
00:55:36,889 --> 00:55:39,926
Ring!
- Ring, ring, Mr. King.

639
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:48,927
One moment.

640
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:55,078
Yes?

641
00:55:56,169 --> 00:55:57,887
Good day to you!

642
00:55:59,249 --> 00:56:02,798
My, what lovely hair.
Wouldn't you say?

643
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:04,358
Hello, Mr. King.

644
00:56:04,769 --> 00:56:06,885
And your skin! Like a fresh peach,

645
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:10,201
merrily making its way
through the thicket and

646
00:56:10,609 --> 00:56:12,520
growing towards the rays of the sun.

647
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,601
And those glamorous, glossy ...

648
00:56:15,009 --> 00:56:16,567
shiny lips.

649
00:56:16,969 --> 00:56:20,120
Don't exaggerate. Beauty is fleeting.

650
00:56:20,529 --> 00:56:23,407
That's true. Ugliness is forever.

651
00:56:25,009 --> 00:56:28,524
My dear! l'm sure you want

652
00:56:28,929 --> 00:56:30,647
to hold on to yours
as long as possible.

653
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:34,086
That's why we're here. How old am l?

654
00:56:34,649 --> 00:56:37,561
l don't know. Early forties?

655
00:56:38,569 --> 00:56:42,528
Right! And how old do l look?

656
00:56:43,089 --> 00:56:44,317
Late forties.

657
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:49,287
Wrong. Early thirties.

658
00:56:49,689 --> 00:56:51,520
And what do l owe that to?

659
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:55,167
The Forever Young Fresh Box!

660
00:56:55,969 --> 00:56:57,197
Quells wrinkles and graying hair

661
00:56:57,609 --> 00:57:00,806
before they wrinkle and gray!

662
00:57:01,809 --> 00:57:06,929
The Forever Young Fresh Box!
l've been sleeping in it every night

663
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:10,127
since my 18th birthday.
And this is the result.

664
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:12,565
l'm turning 18 today!

665
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:15,119
Congratulations!

666
00:57:15,529 --> 00:57:17,485
That means you are eligible for
our happy birthday discount!

667
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:21,039
lf you wish to try it ...
- No, thanks.

668
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:26,648
Put a lid on it! And off with her!

669
00:57:27,049 --> 00:57:28,721
Fresh-boxed!

670
00:57:31,209 --> 00:57:32,198
Hello?

671
00:57:36,529 --> 00:57:41,319
She's coming, she's not coming ...

672
00:57:42,329 --> 00:57:46,800
lf she doesn't come soon,
l'll have to throw the food out.

673
00:57:47,209 --> 00:57:48,562
Who does she think she is!

674
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:51,437
Shit! Why are chicks always late?

675
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:55,478
You're not supposed to say
the bad word! - ''Shit''? - No, ''late''.

676
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:59,040
Does she know we're having a party?

677
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:02,486
Of course not, it's a surprise.

678
00:58:06,529 --> 00:58:08,804
Let's celebrate at home.
Follow me, boys.

679
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:16,405
How long is this going to take?
And what's with the shaking?

680
00:58:16,809 --> 00:58:19,004
Happy Birthday to you!
Happy Birthday to you!

681
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:21,400
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday,

682
00:58:22,849 --> 00:58:24,487
Happy Birthday to you!

683
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:32,637
Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday,
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday to you!

684
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:54,122
Surprise! Surprise!

685
00:59:02,529 --> 00:59:04,087
The towel ...

686
00:59:05,089 --> 00:59:06,602
Still wet ...

687
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:09,481
Very suspicious.

688
00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:14,484
Where is she?

689
00:59:14,889 --> 00:59:16,242
This is impossible.

690
00:59:17,409 --> 00:59:19,161
l got it! l got it!

691
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:22,407
She's not here.

692
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,481
But where is she?

693
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:26,641
l'm asking you.
- Why me?

694
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:31,281
You hated her. She's the better cook.
- Who hit her with a board?

695
00:59:31,689 --> 00:59:32,883
Not me.

696
00:59:33,689 --> 00:59:35,281
l see. l won't be saying ''Check.''

697
00:59:35,689 --> 00:59:38,522
My, l hope
nothing bad happened to her.

698
00:59:38,929 --> 00:59:42,160
She probably got sick
of your claptrap.

699
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:54,208
That's enough! Boys!

700
00:59:54,609 --> 00:59:56,042
We have a new problem.

701
00:59:56,449 --> 00:59:59,168
She's been kidnapped.

702
01:00:00,369 --> 01:00:01,688
Do you know what that means?

703
01:00:02,449 --> 01:00:03,438
Nope.

704
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:05,043
Emergency meeting!

705
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:07,963
We're going to rescue her.
- Yes!

706
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:10,564
lf it's the last thing we do.
- Yes!

707
01:00:10,969 --> 01:00:12,925
The enemy is not completely harmless.

708
01:00:13,729 --> 01:00:15,208
l know her well.

709
01:00:16,969 --> 01:00:18,641
And you're about to meet her.

710
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,801
But we will fight.

711
01:00:22,209 --> 01:00:24,928
But we don't know how.
- So you'll learn!

712
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:26,557
Yes, sir!

713
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:49,081
Attention!

714
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:53,247
What is the basic virtue
of a fighter dwarf?

715
01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:55,648
Strict discipline!

716
01:00:56,049 --> 01:00:57,084
Why?

717
01:00:58,249 --> 01:01:02,447
Because your commander says so!
On my command: To the right!

718
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:06,157
To the left!

719
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:08,478
First!

720
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:11,847
l had a feeling it was coming.

721
01:01:12,489 --> 01:01:13,478
At ease!

722
01:01:14,729 --> 01:01:16,003
How does that work?

723
01:01:16,729 --> 01:01:20,005
''Standing still'' is out.
''Movement'' is in.

724
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:26,483
Miniwiches, anyone?

725
01:01:26,889 --> 01:01:28,322
Not now!

726
01:01:29,329 --> 01:01:31,047
A song, two, three, four.

727
01:01:31,449 --> 01:01:34,361
Sunny day, wishing the clouds away.

728
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:37,283
Hold it! What's with the whining,
you crybabies?

729
01:01:37,689 --> 01:01:39,168
You're like a bunch of girls.

730
01:01:39,569 --> 01:01:41,639
A real song, for real guys!

731
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:47,160
Two, three, four ...
''We're tiny. We're toony.

732
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:50,561
We're driving ...
- ... the Queen looney!''

733
01:01:50,969 --> 01:01:53,722
''lf you're happy and you know it:
- Clap your hands.

734
01:01:54,129 --> 01:01:58,042
We're the new kids on the block!
And Tshakko has the smallest ...''

735
01:01:58,449 --> 01:02:02,078
Dismissed! l've just about had it.

736
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:04,161
Who's there? l see someone.

737
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:25,758
Spliss, why aren't you dancing?

738
01:02:26,169 --> 01:02:30,082
First l'd have to get rid of her ...
- Get rid? Of me? Are you nuts?

739
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:32,878
No, not Her Majesty. Her.

740
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:36,679
ln the box.
- Hello?

741
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:40,287
What are we going to do with her?
- No imagination, eh?

742
01:02:40,689 --> 01:02:44,443
l think it's time for a makeover.

743
01:03:12,009 --> 01:03:13,761
And mount!

744
01:03:17,529 --> 01:03:19,201
Follow me, boys.

745
01:03:27,489 --> 01:03:28,604
Spliss!

746
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:31,603
l'm not coming out
without my old crown.

747
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:34,204
Just have a look at the new one.
- No!

748
01:03:34,609 --> 01:03:36,247
Come on.

749
01:03:36,649 --> 01:03:38,765
All right, fine.

750
01:03:39,489 --> 01:03:41,400
lt looks cheap.

751
01:03:42,409 --> 01:03:44,365
But it didn't cost much.
- Oh. Okay.

752
01:03:51,209 --> 01:03:53,643
l have to go.
- He has to go. - He has to go.

753
01:03:54,049 --> 01:03:56,563
He has to go. - He has to go.
- He has to go. - Later.

754
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:59,642
Later. - Later. - Later. - Later.

755
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:01,277
Too late.

756
01:04:05,729 --> 01:04:07,003
Get in!

757
01:04:12,609 --> 01:04:14,440
Hey there, got a light?

758
01:04:34,769 --> 01:04:35,963
Thanks.

759
01:04:49,369 --> 01:04:51,121
The Queen's stronghold.

760
01:04:52,129 --> 01:04:53,767
Real strong. We'll need a locksmith.

761
01:05:01,929 --> 01:05:03,965
We'll have to proceed on foot.

762
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:07,918
We have to split up. Don't ask why.
- Why?

763
01:05:10,809 --> 01:05:12,128
l'll tell you:

764
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:16,598
l was not born a dwarf.
- What?

765
01:05:17,009 --> 01:05:19,443
But l became one on THAT night,

766
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,958
when my life took a fateful turn.

767
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:28,760
lt should have been
the happiest night of my life.

768
01:05:29,169 --> 01:05:32,605
My beloved wife and l were expecting

769
01:05:33,009 --> 01:05:35,443
our first child that very night.

770
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,840
Many hours passed.

771
01:05:38,249 --> 01:05:43,926
Then the door opened,
and l was to learn the awful truth.

772
01:05:44,849 --> 01:05:46,202
My wife ...?

773
01:05:47,729 --> 01:05:48,764
ls she ...?

774
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:52,602
And my child ...?

775
01:05:54,129 --> 01:05:55,687
ls it ...?

776
01:06:00,529 --> 01:06:03,839
What was that?
- That was me.

777
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:13,720
Then l don't want to be king anymore.

778
01:06:17,409 --> 01:06:20,606
l'd already knitted this cap.

779
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:25,922
for my child ...

780
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:30,325
The King is leaving!

781
01:06:31,289 --> 01:06:33,519
The King is abdicating!

782
01:06:33,929 --> 01:06:35,567
Who's going to ...?

783
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,643
Not the child?

784
01:06:39,049 --> 01:06:42,883
What child? Dispose of it!

785
01:06:43,289 --> 01:06:44,961
Whoever has the crown

786
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,007
is king!

787
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,922
Long live the Queen!

788
01:06:58,249 --> 01:06:59,841
That means, you are ...?

789
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:03,206
So you're not really ...?

790
01:07:03,609 --> 01:07:05,440
And Snow White is your ...?

791
01:07:05,849 --> 01:07:08,841
So you're not coming back with us ...?

792
01:07:09,249 --> 01:07:10,648
Can l have your stuff?

793
01:07:12,129 --> 01:07:14,040
Enough of the maudlin antics.

794
01:07:14,449 --> 01:07:16,201
Go storm the castle.

795
01:07:16,609 --> 01:07:19,077
l'll try and find my daughter.

796
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:21,127
You have a daughter?

797
01:07:22,209 --> 01:07:25,201
How are we going to get
into the castle? - No problem.

798
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:28,328
l carry a ram for moments like this.

799
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:40,198
All right, men!
Let's storm the castle.

800
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:43,486
We're taking back Snow White.

801
01:07:43,889 --> 01:07:46,005
We'll never give up.
- No, we won't!

802
01:07:46,409 --> 01:07:48,604
Not even under torture.
- No ...?

803
01:07:49,009 --> 01:07:50,567
Or if they kill us.

804
01:07:50,969 --> 01:07:53,199
They can tear out our fingernails.
- What?

805
01:07:53,609 --> 01:07:55,201
Or pull out our teeth.

806
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:57,884
They can even crimp our hair.

807
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:01,204
We shall never surrender.
Onwards, men!

808
01:08:01,609 --> 01:08:03,167
Stop, stop, stop.
- What now?

809
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:06,606
Nothing.
- Fascinating. Let's go.

810
01:08:07,009 --> 01:08:09,398
Maybe we should sleep on it?

811
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:12,084
Besides, on an empty stomach ...

812
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:17,119
l could whip up some wieners.
- Silence in the ranks. Let's attack!

813
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:29,798
Who's knocking?

814
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:35,398
What do you want?

815
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:36,958
To get in?

816
01:08:37,369 --> 01:08:40,441
As the doorman,
l hold a clear and simple vision:

817
01:08:40,849 --> 01:08:43,488
No one gets in.

818
01:08:44,249 --> 01:08:47,400
l told you. Violence is no solution.

819
01:08:48,489 --> 01:08:49,478
Yo, asshole.

820
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:51,644
Who are you, anyway?

821
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:53,801
We're the seven dwarves.

822
01:08:54,209 --> 01:08:55,688
Seven dwarves?

823
01:08:58,489 --> 01:08:59,842
There's only six of you.

824
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:02,162
lmpossible.
One, two, three, four, five.

825
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:04,605
Oh, l get it. You're here to apply.

826
01:09:05,969 --> 01:09:07,561
TODAY: JESTER CASTlNG

827
01:09:09,329 --> 01:09:10,557
Yes, yes, yes.

828
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:14,323
l thought dwarves were smaller.

829
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:17,880
Most people think that.
- A common misconception.

830
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:22,123
Shit, man, prejudice!
l know what that's like.

831
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:23,723
Yep!

832
01:09:24,129 --> 01:09:27,246
Seven dwarves, but only six. Yes, yes.

833
01:09:27,649 --> 01:09:29,685
Seven dwarves, but only six! l get it!

834
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:33,286
Hear that? These guys rule!

835
01:09:34,969 --> 01:09:37,199
You da' bomb!

836
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:41,566
You should get your own show.

837
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:46,205
l look into the woods ...

838
01:09:46,609 --> 01:09:49,442
l see good dwarves, bad dwarves ...

839
01:09:49,849 --> 01:09:54,445
A smile that's kind and good ...

840
01:09:55,449 --> 01:09:58,088
old or young ...

841
01:09:58,489 --> 01:10:01,481
you love good dwarves, bad dwarves ...

842
01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:07,646
because they bring you fun.

843
01:10:08,769 --> 01:10:10,088
Open the gate!

844
01:10:44,169 --> 01:10:46,080
l just can't tell jokes.

845
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:49,287
Especially jokes like that.

846
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:51,680
Doctor jokes. Who came up with that?

847
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:54,559
You certainly look like it.

848
01:10:57,289 --> 01:10:59,359
Who was that guy?

849
01:10:59,769 --> 01:11:03,762
Every idiot thinks
they can be a jester. What next?

850
01:11:23,089 --> 01:11:25,125
The joke.
- What? - Joke!

851
01:11:31,449 --> 01:11:35,328
Oh. Right. l know that one.
A woman goes to the doctor.

852
01:11:40,169 --> 01:11:42,080
And she says,
''lt hurts to press here. And here.

853
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:45,322
And pressing here also hurts.''

854
01:11:48,449 --> 01:11:51,805
So the doctor goes,
''You have a broken finger.''

855
01:11:54,129 --> 01:11:58,247
Who thought of that stupid joke?

856
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:02,847
He forgot the punch line.

857
01:12:03,249 --> 01:12:04,921
The woman is a brunette.

858
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:11,565
Brunette. Brilliant.

859
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:15,361
The joke is mine, obviously.

860
01:12:15,769 --> 01:12:19,364
Spliss, you are a born entertainer.

861
01:12:19,769 --> 01:12:23,239
You have such beautiful tips.
Mind if l touch them?

862
01:12:26,129 --> 01:12:28,518
All right, fine. But make it quick.

863
01:12:28,929 --> 01:12:30,999
Snow White's are much nicer, though.

864
01:12:32,649 --> 01:12:34,446
Out!

865
01:12:43,049 --> 01:12:45,643
Do you think you'll make the cut?
- No.

866
01:12:46,049 --> 01:12:47,960
Next!
- Right!

867
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:50,246
Let's go.

868
01:12:52,089 --> 01:12:54,319
To the doctor. Funny!

869
01:12:56,409 --> 01:12:58,604
Enough of this nonsense.

870
01:12:59,049 --> 01:13:01,324
Er ... Right.

871
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:03,560
Woman! Doctor! Ow!

872
01:13:03,969 --> 01:13:05,288
Or this ...

873
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:08,918
Too loud.

874
01:13:09,329 --> 01:13:10,398
Louder?

875
01:13:10,809 --> 01:13:13,767
A brunette with a broken finger
goes to the doctor ...

876
01:13:14,169 --> 01:13:16,842
That was the punch line.
What are you doing?

877
01:13:17,249 --> 01:13:20,366
l've never broken anything.
Because l'm careful.

878
01:13:20,769 --> 01:13:23,567
Did you know that most
accidents occur at home ...

879
01:13:23,969 --> 01:13:25,800
Some bitch goes to the doctor ...

880
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:28,518
Do you have to be so negative?

881
01:13:28,929 --> 01:13:32,922
You don't even know her ...
- So? l know chicks.

882
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:35,240
Anyway, a woman goes to the doctor ...

883
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:39,198
Doctors are crooks!
- The doctor asks what the problem is.

884
01:13:39,609 --> 01:13:41,600
Her money! She won't have any left!
- And she says ...

885
01:13:42,009 --> 01:13:45,843
HMOs treat you like cattle.
And the services are all lousy.

886
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:49,525
That's the problem with our society.
- We need more justice. Equality ...

887
01:13:49,929 --> 01:13:53,285
And fraternity.
- Right. This whole mess ...

888
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:57,523
makes you wanna go: Fu ...
- ... crying out loud!

889
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:11,082
Hello.

890
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:21,563
A jest.

891
01:14:25,969 --> 01:14:28,483
There was this woman.

892
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:31,007
And this woman,

893
01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:32,922
she went to the doctor.

894
01:14:42,329 --> 01:14:44,968
What do you want? - l want
to restore liberty to the land.

895
01:14:46,369 --> 01:14:49,805
What?
l'll seize power, depose

896
01:14:50,209 --> 01:14:53,360
the evil queen
and liberate Snow White.

897
01:14:56,969 --> 01:14:59,199
Not bad, eh?

898
01:15:01,009 --> 01:15:05,366
l like that. ''Liberate Snow White.''

899
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:10,604
And the woman says to the doctor,

900
01:15:11,409 --> 01:15:13,400
the one that she'd gone to:

901
01:15:14,729 --> 01:15:15,764
''Doctor'', she says,

902
01:15:16,169 --> 01:15:18,160
''lf l press here

903
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:23,447
it hurts.''

904
01:15:40,849 --> 01:15:43,841
Don't be afraid, my child.

905
01:15:44,249 --> 01:15:46,638
l'm here to accompany you
on this difficult journey.

906
01:15:47,049 --> 01:15:48,846
l bring you a sign,

907
01:15:49,489 --> 01:15:51,605
a sign that there's life

908
01:15:52,009 --> 01:15:53,408
after crimping.

909
01:15:53,809 --> 01:15:54,798
Father!

910
01:15:56,049 --> 01:15:58,199
Holy father.

911
01:15:58,609 --> 01:16:00,839
So, doctor ...

912
01:16:01,249 --> 01:16:03,399
if l press here ...

913
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:07,321
then ...

914
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:14,046
My God, why is this so difficult?
lt's a perfectly simple joke:

915
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:18,567
A brunette comes to the doctor and
says: ''When l press here, it hurts.

916
01:16:18,969 --> 01:16:20,846
When l press here, it hurts,
and when l press here, it also hurts.''

917
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:23,126
Says the doctor:
''You have a broken finger.''

918
01:16:26,089 --> 01:16:29,126
Wonderful! Spliss, you are fabulous!

919
01:16:31,329 --> 01:16:33,160
l have a fantastic idea ...

920
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:38,121
Why can't l keep my mouth shut?

921
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:42,562
Look at that! Cheap!

922
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:46,725
l can't rule like this.

923
01:16:50,529 --> 01:16:51,598
Come on.

924
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:03,323
Go on.

925
01:17:11,209 --> 01:17:13,518
Yummy! Breakfast!

926
01:17:13,929 --> 01:17:17,638
Speaking of ...

927
01:17:18,049 --> 01:17:20,244
Yesterday, at home.
The egg was too soft.

928
01:17:20,649 --> 01:17:22,765
l let my wife have it! l was like:

929
01:17:23,169 --> 01:17:26,445
''Bitch! lf that happens one more time

930
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:29,727
l'll throw it right in your face.''

931
01:17:30,129 --> 01:17:32,848
You said that to her?

932
01:17:34,009 --> 01:17:38,127
Well ... not in those words.
What l said was:

933
01:17:38,529 --> 01:17:40,724
''The egg is great, darling.

934
01:17:41,129 --> 01:17:44,599
But another minute
would've been nice.'' To her face!

935
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:46,124
That's crazy.

936
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:47,723
Right on.

937
01:17:50,929 --> 01:17:52,521
Shit. A bloodhound.

938
01:17:53,809 --> 01:17:56,039
l know that dog.

939
01:17:57,769 --> 01:18:00,841
Don't worry,
he's harmless. He likes me.

940
01:18:30,889 --> 01:18:34,120
We've come to the following verdict:

941
01:18:34,529 --> 01:18:35,598
For the crime

942
01:18:36,009 --> 01:18:39,445
of deliberate and delicious beauty

943
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:41,487
and attempted

944
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:46,804
escape from the kingdom,

945
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:49,519
the accused, Snow White,
will receive the highest penalty.

946
01:18:49,929 --> 01:18:51,044
The chair.

947
01:18:52,809 --> 01:18:54,003
And that means:

948
01:18:54,409 --> 01:18:56,525
Crimped for life.

949
01:18:58,689 --> 01:19:00,680
Boss?
- What's that?

950
01:19:01,089 --> 01:19:02,317
That saw?

951
01:19:04,689 --> 01:19:08,125
Saw? Of course.

952
01:19:08,529 --> 01:19:11,487
lt's time
we saw a blessing around here.

953
01:19:18,849 --> 01:19:20,487
lt is indeed a blessing

954
01:19:20,889 --> 01:19:22,766
that l might have the last word,

955
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:24,928
for l am ...

956
01:19:35,049 --> 01:19:36,880
Not again.

957
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,321
A woman goes to the doctor ...

958
01:19:47,329 --> 01:19:50,480
Where was l?
- ''That l might have the last word,

959
01:19:50,889 --> 01:19:54,882
for l am ...'' Right.
That l might have the last word,

960
01:19:55,329 --> 01:19:56,842
for l am ...

961
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:01,678
Brummboss! My crown!

962
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:04,000
Yes. l have the crown.

963
01:20:04,409 --> 01:20:08,607
l am your once and future king.

964
01:20:09,009 --> 01:20:10,920
That is the law.

965
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:19,485
Promise you'll never leave me again.

966
01:20:19,889 --> 01:20:21,322
l promise.

967
01:20:36,089 --> 01:20:37,841
Spliss!

968
01:20:39,089 --> 01:20:40,966
Do something.

969
01:20:41,369 --> 01:20:42,961
Yes, your Majesty.

970
01:20:43,369 --> 01:20:46,167
Security!

971
01:20:52,369 --> 01:20:53,688
My men!

972
01:21:17,129 --> 01:21:18,118
One word!

973
01:21:18,529 --> 01:21:21,487
Just one stupid word!

974
01:21:39,729 --> 01:21:43,438
Hey, dwarves, hey, dwarves, ho!

975
01:21:51,569 --> 01:21:53,844
Thank you, boys.

976
01:21:54,249 --> 01:21:56,922
l am proud of you. All of you.

977
01:21:57,809 --> 01:22:00,721
A princely reward awaits you.

978
01:22:02,449 --> 01:22:04,246
Take off your caps.

979
01:22:10,289 --> 01:22:14,282
l will now drop this feather.
Whosoever it lands on shall receive

980
01:22:14,689 --> 01:22:16,486
my daughter's hand in marriage.

981
01:22:17,449 --> 01:22:18,438
Excuse me?

982
01:22:18,849 --> 01:22:20,840
You always wanted a fairy-tale prince.

983
01:22:21,249 --> 01:22:23,604
Now your dream will come true.

984
01:22:24,009 --> 01:22:25,920
Let fate decide.

985
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:28,881
Out of my way!
- Move over!

986
01:22:30,729 --> 01:22:33,482
Each and every one of them
is a prince.

987
01:22:34,329 --> 01:22:38,720
Well, the thing is ...
- And they have all proven themselves.

988
01:22:39,449 --> 01:22:41,519
They are ready for

989
01:22:41,929 --> 01:22:43,920
the greatest challenge of all:
Marriage.

990
01:22:44,329 --> 01:22:47,207
But l've already found my prince.

991
01:22:48,929 --> 01:22:49,884
Come again?

992
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:54,123
A man with a great sense of humor
and great hair.

993
01:22:54,529 --> 01:22:56,599
He even quit smoking for me.

994
01:22:57,009 --> 01:23:02,129
He was there for me when l needed him.

995
01:23:02,529 --> 01:23:06,363
Wazzup, Daddy!
You ought to be proud of her.

996
01:23:06,769 --> 01:23:08,646
She's got great taste in men.

997
01:23:09,049 --> 01:23:11,358
And she's got a sense of humor.

998
01:23:11,769 --> 01:23:15,398
Got one for you: How do you
entertain a bru... a blonde for hours?

999
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:20,807
Take a piece of paper
and write ''turn over'' on both sides.

1000
01:23:25,369 --> 01:23:27,041
That's fate ... Boys?

1001
01:23:33,369 --> 01:23:36,679
Hey, dwarves, hey, dwarves,
hey, dwarves, ho!

1002
01:23:37,089 --> 01:23:38,442
Go! Go! Go!

1003
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:40,123
Yes!

1004
01:23:42,209 --> 01:23:44,848
Well, we all learned something.
- Yeah, like what?

1005
01:23:45,249 --> 01:23:47,843
That broads are cold and brutal.
- Yes, they are!

1006
01:23:48,249 --> 01:23:51,525
They use you and throw you away.
- Yes, they do!

1007
01:23:51,929 --> 01:23:54,648
That'll never happen again.
- No, it won't!

1008
01:23:55,049 --> 01:23:57,324
We're done with chicks.
- Yes, we are!

1009
01:23:57,729 --> 01:23:59,003
Excuse me?

1010
01:24:14,129 --> 01:24:17,007
l was on my way to my grandma's

1011
01:24:17,409 --> 01:24:19,604
to bring her some cake and wine.
And then l saw your house

1012
01:24:20,009 --> 01:24:22,728
and l thought,
maybe l could rest for a bit ...

1013
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:29,043
l had a dream about you!

1014
01:24:29,929 --> 01:24:31,601
Who are you, anyway?

1015
01:24:32,009 --> 01:24:34,000
We're the seven dwarves.

1016
01:24:34,409 --> 01:24:38,038
l thought dwarves were smaller.

1017
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:41,327
Most people think that.
- A common misconception.

1018
01:24:41,729 --> 01:24:43,720
Why don't you come in?

1019
01:24:54,249 --> 01:24:58,765
And so the story came to a funny end.

1020
01:24:59,169 --> 01:25:01,558
THAT night.
