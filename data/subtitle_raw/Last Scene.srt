00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,999
This is Fujiko, a year ago

00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,189

You couId get me
another actress

That's why the next movie is
so important to me!

00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,208

135
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,094
TV is rapidIy growing up

136
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,289
We must find a way
to get through this

137
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,093
-That
-That's why

138
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:57,395
We need new faces

139
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:04,999
We must be proactive
If not, we can't survive

00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,008
It's inevitabIe

141
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,479
Way more serious than you think

142
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,292
I guess I have no choice

143
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:27,688

00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:13,689
It's not your fauIt

182
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:17,290
-There wiII be
-I'm not coming to your fareweII party

183
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,599
I thought so

184
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,403
You don't have to quit
because you got married

185
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:30,577
There is no guarantee
for good parts in the future

186
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,775
AIso, I don't want to go into TV

187
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,782
That is so practicaI

188
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:42,588
An acting career is
a career of criticism and

189
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,993
I am tired of criticism

190
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:51,999
Don't push yourseIf too hard, too

191
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,501
-Keiko! Come here!
-I'II be right over, I gotta go

192
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,674
Good-bye

193
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:12,187
I am sure
I'II do fine even without you

194
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,787
Movie days are over

195
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:34,511
SpeciaI report on a huge
car accident happened near Tokyo

196
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:40,482
SeveraI cars got fiIed up
on the truck

197
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:46,489
that feII on the side
of the 3-19 freeway

198
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:53,997
At Ieast 5 peopIe were kiIIed and 15 peopIe were
severeIy injured according to the poIice report

199
00:18:54,166 --> 00:19:00,571
The crash site is crowded
with peopIe...

200
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,698
-Is the thunder working?
-Yes, it is

201
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,305
Let's do it

202
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:13,248
He was going around a curve
when the tires bIew out...

203
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,680
What is it?

204
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,288
-It sure is a huge accident
-No, I mean, why aren't we working?

205
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,987
But the director is not

206
00:19:21,126 --> 00:19:25,187
Then, go get him
We don't have aII day

207
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:32,598
How big wiII the frame be?

208
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,205
Head to chest

209
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,897
Boring

210
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:39,306
How about a cIose-up
with the teIephone in front?

211
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,714
No It's fine this way

212
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:44,381
Oh, yes

213
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,480
Prop!

214
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:52,679
Put that baby thing where
I can see, for inspiration

215
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:57,488
Scene begins with phone ringing

216
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:01,491
Um, we were OK
up to right before phone rings...

217
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:06,002
I know that
It's aII about inspiration

218
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,799
I'm sorry

219
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,300
Do it right, or you wiII be
an assistant forever

220
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:17,078
OK
Let's go

221
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,779
You want it here?

222
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,378
Take that away
It gets in the shot

223
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,189
What did you say?

224
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:31,095
I'm so sorry

225
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,094
Get down here!

226
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,493
Watch out!

227
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:34,899
He's not worth it

228
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,398
Get your stupid ass down here!

229
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,203
-Sorry...
-You stupid IittIe

230
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,987
What? What are you
Iooking at? Huh?

231
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:02,389
-PIease stop! No need to beat him up Iike that
-Let go of me!

232
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,104
What movies are you in
these days?

233
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:16,605
Something about the sea
since I pIay a saiIor

234
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:19,609
I get different parts everyday

235
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,508
- Which session are you?
- 8th

236
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,672
What session are you
Mr. Okita?

237
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:26,477
That's not how we started

238
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,486
Oh, yeah?
Then how did start?

239
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,786
How did I
Hey! Yo! How did you start?

240
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:36,689
Because I was a new face

241
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,991
ReaIIy?

242
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:40,996
He's kidding
He is not a reaI actor

243
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,691
My, stop it

244
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,997
We aII have different stories

245
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,504
But mostIy
it's a connection inside

246
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,600
Hey, Ken

247
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,906
Oh, my gosh It's Mr Mihara!

248
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,876
What's with that outfit?

249
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,576
- A saiIor, I presume
- Oh, yes It shouId be

250
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:02,186
We are off now

251
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:05,080
Which team is yours?
And aII these IoveIy Iadies

252

What are you doing?

265
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,508
Don't worry
It's part of an acting career, too

266
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:00,702
Somebody might come in

267
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,679
No one is coming
Be a good girI

268
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,677
I can taIk an executive
into hiring you as my counterpart

269
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,583
Your counterpart?

270
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,784
Yes, starting next month

271
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,193
We wiII continue this
after that, then

272
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:33,900
Work is not over yet

273
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:41,911
What brought you here
to the studio?

274
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:47,783
It's been reaIIy Iong
So many changes here, too

275
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:53,582
Was this buiIding here
during my days?

276
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,793
WeII, maybe

277
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:06,097
Can't you just quit?

278
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,406
You drink at work
hiding from peopIe

279
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,010
I am not hiding

280
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:21,183
Remember Masda?
He pIayed a cop in ''Either Love or Dream''

281
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,378
Oh, yes Masda

282
00:25:23,822 --> 00:25:27,280
He aIso drank
with a IittIe bottIe Iike this

283
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:31,994
in the corner of the studio

284
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,793
whiIe others were working...

285
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,597
Is he stiII around?

286
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,301
Not since a few years ago

287
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:48,401
I wonder what he's doing
these days

288
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,474
He's an aIcohoIic...
Enough with him

289
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,881
Are you ok? Isn't this your

290
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:05,988
Doesn't matter now

291

Honey, do you have the script?

292
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,298
Script? Or course I do

I've been doing it

296
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:24,882
But

297
00:26:25,016 --> 00:26:29,385

It's a job. You were an actress,
once You shouId know it... Or what?

304
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:25,203
Are you stiII suspecting things

305
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,181

00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:20,498
Some idiot puIIed up a car right
in front of the studio entrance

339
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:27,803
I'm sure it has nothing to do

- Which coIor?
- Doesn't matter

352
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,687

358
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:31,886

00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,706

363
00:35:46,844 --> 00:35:51,781
OK, this is a tryout
A tryout

00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,598
It's from Hawaii whiIe working

370
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,671

371

-AIright, is this okay?

373
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,803
What kind of nurse is that?

374
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:50,908
Some kind of nurse, that is

375
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,147
- Have you been on a ride?
- Yes

376
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,181
At the amusement park...

377
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:09,691
I think any Buddhist thing

378
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,494
Oh, reaIIy?

379
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,599

-Hey, Mio, that's not right
-Why?

381
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,299
We got another actor
for that part

382
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:27,502
What? Then this

383
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,810
I don't think we can use it

384
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:35,684
You shouId've toId me earIier
Do we have that man's picture?

385
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,385

00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,787
-Testing!
-OK, go!

388
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,995
Where on earth is there
a nurse this tanned?

389
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,197
But

390
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,807
Look who's taIking

391
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,910
There's no doctor Iike

392
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,973
Director! Testing wiII start
in a second Director!

you're so tanned

398
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,803
It couId happen

399
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:36,212
Lucky...

00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:40,483
OK , Iet's run a test

401
00:38:44,021 --> 00:38:46,990
I am dying, aren't I?

402
00:38:47,124 --> 00:38:49,490
Don't say that

403
00:38:50,227 --> 00:38:55,096
How come no one
teIIs me anything?

404
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:59,796
I saw my mother crying
over there

405
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,800
TeII me! Am I dying?

406
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:11,973
Don't worry
Dr. Samejima wiII cure you

407
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:19,882
Put your Iife in my hand!

408
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,395
Whose phone is that?

409
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:38,200
HeIIo? No, I am working

410
00:39:40,745 --> 00:39:45,478
Oh, you want the answer
It's a crab, get it? A crab

411
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:56,084
It's for a funeraI, I wish I couId
to get a recent photo of him

412
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,092
-He is coming here, right?
-Yes

413
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,198
Then why don't you
take a photo of him?

414
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:05,996
But they say he worked for
this company

415
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:09,698
Yes, he used to work here

416
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:22,479
Here, this is aII I got
Ken Mihara

417
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,095
Never seen this face before

418
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:35,995
His time was brief

419
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:39,594
I think he was an aIcohoIic
Even after his wife died

420
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:43,901
He got into troubIe because of
his aIcohoI probIem

421
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:50,371
No other photos of him? According
to the profiIe, he is 65 now

422
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:55,383
Nope, I heard he retired

423
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,084
Ah, yes, here's a photo of him
as a chiId actor

424
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:27,675
Put your Iife in my hand!

425
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:34,485
In My hand!

426
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:42,488
You Iook upset...
Oh, I couId come to your pIace tonight

427
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,794
No, I got work to do

428
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,198
You are so coId these days

429
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,809
You didn't even answer my caII
yesterday

430
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:58,279
I caIIed your home, your wife said
you were aIready in bed

431
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:03,278
What? My home?
What for?

432
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:07,689
Is yeIIow OK for it?

433
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:10,487
Whatever, hey, did you reaIIy
caII my home?

434
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,995
Whatever, what coIor?

00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,896
WeII, anything bright
Enough with that

436
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,594
Which bright coIor?

437
00:42:20,437 --> 00:42:21,995
Um, weII

438
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:26,603
What coIor is an
anti-cancer soIution?

439
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,574
I think I'd better go

440
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,279
Why?

441
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:07,077
Where is the studio?

442
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,980
Which studio?

443
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,790
- For ''Dr. Samejima''
- Oh, this one

444
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:32,707
-Oh, are you a prop manager?
-Yes, I am

00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,075
Someone shouId be there
Go ahead

446
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,594
It's OK to go in

447
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:54,397
No, that

448
00:43:56,734 --> 00:44:02,297
When the Iight fIashes, it used to
mean ''Shooting in Progress''

449
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,607
It's stiII the same

450
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,084
You must be our oId man

451
00:44:19,223 --> 00:44:20,588
Yes

452
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:23,290
You were supposed to meet me
at the main gate

453
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:27,488
- I know my way around
- I see

454
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,698
Um, shooting
hasn't started yet

455
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,995
Can you wait in the waiting room?

456
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:37,096
- Mio, show him the way
- Huh? Me?

457
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:40,802

00:44:40,944 --> 00:44:43,879
-You got your script, right?

ShaII we go then?
This way, pIease

461
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,687
I have to take your photo

462
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:00,990

00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:05,591

- Oh, Yes

464
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:13,900
<i>Dr. Samejima</i>

465
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:17,275

00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:21,284

00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,272
-Excuse me
-Yes?

472
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,781
This

473
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:58,681
Doesn't matter
There's no waIking scene

474
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:04,089
It was a Iast minute decision
We weren't even informed your size

475
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:13,189
The patient is supposed to be
in the 3rd stage of cancer

476
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,993
Then, wouId you Iie down?

477
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,692
-Exam with bare hands Iike this
-With bare hands?

478
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,703
Let's say, there's something
Iumpy around here

479
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,306
Lumpy?

480
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,706
In that case, you say 'You have
water retaining here ' casuaIIy

481
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:29,813
Oh, casuaIIy

482
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:33,075
That's right

483
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,981
Do not say so to the patients

484
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,087
Let's switch the roIes here

485
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:44,388

00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,893

502
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:30,498

Don't you think?

515

531
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:34,095
No, it doesn't
It doesn't hurt

532
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:43,601
HoIIy shit!

533
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:50,776
It's so creepy
Whoa! Don't Iook at me

534
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:58,186
Let's see Damn it, Scary
It's Iike a horror movie

535
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:01,085
ReaI Horror

536
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:08,197
Hey, makeup
Isn't this too much?

537
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:11,095
No, I onIy took off his foundation

538
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,203
ReaIIy?

539
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:19,407
Then we'II go this way
It's so reaIistic

540
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:23,572
You're reaIIy scaring me!

541
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:27,376
OK , OK
Then Iet's run a test

542
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:29,480
OK, testing

543
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:40,490
Mr. Yamada
Any reIative is fine

544
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,997
We must take care of insurance
and other things

545
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,197
I have money

546
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,098
It's not that

547
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:53,300
I need to taIk with your famiIy
about treatment, too

548
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:57,775
Anyone's fine, just Iet me
contact any of them

549
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,775
You must be IoneIy
not to have any visitor at aII

550
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,087
No wife, no chiIdren

551
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:09,791
Don't bother!

552
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:16,998
They are in heaven aIready
Just Ieave me aIone!

553
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:20,796
Cut!

554
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,704
Diretor, you go there
Samejima

555
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,387
This way, Yuka, here
Nice to meet you

556
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:47,886
The mystery of Dr. Samejima's
earIy Iife gets

557
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:51,091
cIearer in the movie, I've heard

558
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:56,399
Yes, the mystery wiII be soIved

559
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,388
Long time, no see

560
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:18,191
Excuse me?

561
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,891
I've never forgotten you
Get down here!

562
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:28,095
-I am terribIy sorry
-You stupid IittIe

563
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,606
What? What are you
Iooking at? Huh?

564
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,544
Now you are one fine engineer

565
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,878
I owe you a big one
It's good to see you again

566
00:53:47,023 --> 00:53:48,490
Same here
REALLY good to see you again

567
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:50,991
Let's not pIay it hard today

568
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:08,611
Now for the director
it's your first movie

569
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,976
Have you aIways been
pIanning on making movies?

570
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:15,380
WeII, I...
Thank you

571
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:17,883
So...

572
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:25,894
You know the movie ''Omen 2''
That captured my heart

573
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:30,591
I've aIways dreamt of making
movies Iike that, even once

574
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:34,099
Did you have Iunch?

575
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:38,505
WouId you come to waiting room?
Let's take your photo

576
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,503
OK

577
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:50,784
That was hard

578
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:54,686
My part wiII be edited
anyway, right?

579
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,883
Of course, it wiII be

580
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,587
Er, Excuse me

581
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,200
Dr. Samejima's hourgIass

582
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:05,494
HourgIass?

583
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:08,695
Yes, during the operation
on a desert isIand

584
00:55:09,439 --> 00:55:10,599
Desert isIand?

585
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,801
Yes During his operation
on a boy there,

586
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:19,074
after crossing over
the stormy ocean

587
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:21,584
There was an hourgIass?

588
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:24,380
At the Iast meeting
you said what

589
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:27,979
if he used an hourgIass
to check puIses...

590
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:33,092
Yes, I did
Yes, yes

591
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:37,131
I couIdn't find the one
you wanted

592
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:42,603
So, I made one myseIf

593
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:45,799
But, do they check puIses
with an hourgIass?

594
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,308
No ordinary watch?

595
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:52,279
You said the watch gets broken
because of the sea water

596
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:56,278
Waterproof
G-shock, Iike this

597
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,281
But

598
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,388
Forget it
That wouIdn't Iook right

599
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:03,390
Go with it
Director has spoken

600
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,290
OK

601
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:47,470
<i>Congratulations Keiko</i>
<i>The end of Love</i>

602
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,376
Opened on October 12th, 1965

603
00:56:58,515 --> 00:57:01,279
The Big Star Keiko's
finaI masterpiece

604
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:08,787
The End of Love
I didn't see it...

605
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,294
Hundreds of movies came out

606
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,193
every year those days

607
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:20,494
Most of them were hardIy
known to the pubIic,

608
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:25,999
but they were aII good

609
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:29,307
It's not easy to watch oId movies
in a theater

610
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,472
or on video these days

611
00:57:33,716 --> 00:57:35,183
That's true

612
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:42,890
I used to work here as
a recording engineer

613
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,493
It was exciting back then

614
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:52,900
The studio was fuII of peopIe
Iights were on nights and days

615
00:57:53,837 --> 00:57:59,104
I worked Iike crazy everyday

616
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:03,378
But I reaIIy miss then

617
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,580
Oh, my

618
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:17,082
-Mihara, is it reaIIy you?
-Yes

619
00:58:18,127 --> 00:58:24,691
There was a huge Iayoff
when I was 40

620
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:28,103
They toId me to be a freeIancer

621
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:31,401
In other word, I got fired

622
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:35,605
There was a sharp faII
in production

623
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:43,479
Right, I was forced to take
an ordinary job

624
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:50,084
It wasn't easy
FiIm was aII I knew

625
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:58,895
I swore not to come back

626
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:03,603
but eventuaIIy I came back

627
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:09,009
Swore not to come back

628
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:12,781
What do you think it is?

629
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:20,587
I've aIways wanted to
come back... Why?

630
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:32,001
- What is it?
- Nothing

631
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:36,699
Oh, the waiting room
during the oId days

632
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,399
-Did you use it, too?
-Yes

633
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:47,077
It's a warehouse now
The fIoor is aII rotten and ruined

634
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,877
Is that so

635
00:59:53,623 --> 01:00:02,190
What can you do? They are TV
peopIe, and that's their attitude...

636
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,702
Oh, and the director
he got his hair impIanted

637
01:00:14,243 --> 01:00:18,771
It's aIright
I quit

638
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,177
Quit what?

639
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:23,376
- Work
- Why?

640
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:24,781
Because it's useIess

641
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:32,889
Come on, you were just
unIucky this time

642
01:00:33,329 --> 01:00:37,993
What an asshoIe

643
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,797
He succeeded in TV

644
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,997
He doesn't know
shit about movies

645
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:46,701
Just kissing the
TV producer's ass

646
01:00:49,045 --> 01:00:52,481
But stiII he is a director

647
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,676
even with impIanted hair

648
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,389
Supporting a director to
compIete a movie

649
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:06,290
no matter what
That's ourjob

650
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:09,193
-Some job you have there
-Listen

651
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:18,096
I know work is hard
the paycheck isn't stabIe

652
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:23,872
and you are busy as heII
But you are doing great

653
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:29,683
Let's taIk about it tonight
I can stay over your house

654
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,287
What the heII are you
taIking about?

655
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:38,486
- Why you
- Get out!

656
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:41,290
- What the
- Get out

657
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:17,900
Someone there?

658
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,278
Sorry, sorry

659
01:02:34,617 --> 01:02:39,281
What are you doing there?

660
01:02:39,622 --> 01:02:42,182
I didn't mean to

661
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:47,392
I was remembering oId days
and my feet Ied me here

662
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:54,394
I used to date here
behind peopIe's eyes

663
01:02:55,338 --> 01:02:58,899
It was nothing Iike that

664
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:03,108
Besides, you shouId be
in the waiting room

665
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,880
Sit down here, pIease

666
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,680
Here we go

667
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,600
SmiIe, pIease

668
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:37,779
Make it a soft smiIe

669
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,978
- Make me Iaugh
- Excuse me?

670
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:47,888
It's been awhiIe

671
01:03:48,224 --> 01:03:51,682
I mean I wasn't the good at smiIing
naturaIIy back then, either

672
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:56,397
The guard showed me
your oId photo

673
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:59,399
You were a chiId actor

674
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:02,202
There was a studio
near my house

675
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:04,898
I was accidentaIIy picked up

676
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,202
You got picked up?
CooI!

677
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:11,677
It wasn't that great
One day, a director asked me

678
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:15,484
You, aren't you hungry?'

679
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:26,185
Come to think of it now

680
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:30,693
any kid who couId eat vigorousIy
was fine to him

681
01:04:31,634 --> 01:04:36,594
I was perfect because
my famiIy was so poor

682
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:43,574
I wore a costume, a wig
and make-up

683
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,475
After one Iine

684
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,981
aII I had to do was eat

685
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:57,082
During the shoot I had a bowI of rice

686
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:04,388
Whenever mother roIe actress
made a mistake

687
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:07,502
I got a whoIe new bowI of rice

688
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:12,806
It was heaven

689
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:16,773
As Iong as that woman had
kept making mistakes

690
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:24,584
I'd eat as much as I couId
I thought I reaIIy stuffed myseIf

691
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:32,082
Then I thought, an acting
career was good

692
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:35,295
Movies were good

693
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:40,392
There are onIy a few reaI actors

694
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,202
The rest works just for food

695
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:52,575
- Are you serious?
- Excuse me?

696
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:54,678
About quitting yourjob?

697
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:00,989
You heard it

698
01:06:01,424 --> 01:06:04,587
I'm sorry
Are you serious?

699
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,896
Yes, I am

700
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:09,796
ReaIIy

701
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,196
I Iove movies
That's why I'm here, but

702
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:17,806
But?

703
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,740
Um...

704
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:25,277
You once quit acting
didn't you?

705
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,179

Let's Ieave it there
Can't you just shorten his scene?

888
01:24:32,434 --> 01:24:36,200
No, you can't
DefiniteIy can't!

889
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:44,277
It's not your business, princess

890
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:53,184
- Mr. Maejima
- Yes?

891
01:24:53,922 --> 01:24:57,289
Isn't it a bit dim on Mr. Mihara?

892
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:59,791
Yeah, it is
ShouId we bring it up?

894
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,594
Never mind
We might edit this out

895
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,704
What time is it supposed to be?

896
01:25:15,944 --> 01:25:17,468
What's the time?

897
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:20,477
Oh, weII, midnight, I think

898
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:24,278
5 o'cIock
Is it 5 AM?

899
01:25:24,919 --> 01:25:26,784
Who gives a damn about a cIock?

900
01:25:26,921 --> 01:25:29,788
Who says so, you rat!

901
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:32,285

01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:01,589
I'm sorry, I'm fine now

904
01:26:01,723 --> 01:26:03,190
Are you reaIIy OK ?

905
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,759
- One more mistake, man, One more!

906
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:15,200

Ready, go!

908
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:53,303
You sounded so desperate
Your daughter?

909
01:26:53,641 --> 01:27:00,979
No, his daughter is Ichie
and his wife is Sachiko

910
01:27:01,416 --> 01:27:03,384
Then who is she?

911
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,778
She was my sweetheart

912
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:09,885
Did you see her in a dream?

913
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:13,185
CouId it be my Iife
passing through

914
01:27:13,628 --> 01:27:18,088
in front of my eyes
right before I die?

915
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:23,397
Kayoko is his daughter
between his ex-wife

916
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:36,182
You! Who gave you right to
investigate my past?

917
01:27:36,818 --> 01:27:40,481
I'm sorry, Mr. Yamada, it might
not be my business, but...

918
01:27:40,622 --> 01:27:43,682
Stay out of my business

919
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:47,688
I toId you
I don't want to see anyone

920
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:51,896
Don't interrupt my death!

921
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,102
Let's go

922
01:28:10,018 --> 01:28:13,476
- OK, Perfect!
- OK, Perfect!

923
01:28:15,523 --> 01:28:16,888
Now, next scene

01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:30,702
- Are you OK?
- Yes

925
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:34,704
One more scene

926
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:49,086
- When wiII it be over?
- We have a Iive show to do soon

927
01:28:49,223 --> 01:28:52,989
WeII, it's the oId man's

928
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:56,995
When time's up
we'II take him out

929
01:28:57,131 --> 01:29:01,397
That won't be possibIe, we, too

01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:10,770
OK , then do them first!
No rehearsaI

933
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:12,379
If the oId man makes a mistake

934
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:13,878
- PIease do that
- TeII director so

935
01:29:14,015 --> 01:29:15,175
It's aII about time saving

936
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:26,990
Did you find her?

937
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:32,291
She's...
She aIready died

938
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:40,604
Last year, breast cancer
She was onIy 36

939
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:44,377
How sad

940
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:50,682
Yamada must have
known it aIready

941
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:07,694
Kayoko, thanks for coming

942
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:18,170

01:31:25,713 --> 01:31:28,181

You have to Iet Samejima go

Is that so?

969
01:32:23,838 --> 01:32:25,999
Doesn't this take Iong?

970
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:28,704
It'II onIy take a second

971
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:30,777
You have to reset
the Iighting and others

972

973
