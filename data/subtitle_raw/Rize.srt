00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,770
Six days of rioting in a Negro
section of Los Angeles...

3
00:00:52,822 --> 00:00:56,399
left behind scenes reminiscent
of war-torn cities.

4
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,151
More than
a hundred square blocks...

5
00:00:58,192 --> 00:00:59,819
were decimated
by fire and looters.

6
00:00:59,861 --> 00:01:02,113
Civil rights leaders
were quick to deplore...

7
00:01:02,155 --> 00:01:04,115
the unbridled lawlessness...

8
00:01:04,157 --> 00:01:07,368
and Martin Luther King vowed
to do all in his power...

9
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,580
to prevent a reoccurrence
in Los Angeles or anywhere.

10
00:02:11,182 --> 00:02:13,726
This is our neighborhood.

11
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:16,229
This is where we grew up.

12
00:02:19,816 --> 00:02:22,401
We were all kids back then
when this happened...

13
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:26,823
but we managed to grow
from these ashes.

14
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,376
And this is
where we still live.

15
00:03:16,831 --> 00:03:18,541
Well, if you're drowning
and there's nothing around...

16
00:03:18,583 --> 00:03:20,543
for help
but a board floating...

17
00:03:20,585 --> 00:03:22,795
you're gonna reach out
for that board.

18
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:24,380
And this was our board.

19
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:32,180
And from this board...

20
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,214
we floated abroad,
and we built us a big ship.

21
00:03:35,266 --> 00:03:38,311
And we're gonna sail into
the dance world, the art world.

22
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:41,355
We're gonna take it by storm
because it's our belief.

23
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:43,357
This is not a trend.
Let me repeat.

24
00:03:43,399 --> 00:03:45,318
This is not a trend.

25
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:49,590
You better give me a hug.
Give me a hug.

26
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:51,259
I need a hug.
Give me a hug.

27
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,718
You don't have to dance.

28
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,762
I want a hug from
a pretty girl like you.

29
00:04:54,804 --> 00:04:57,515
You are so pretty.
Come here, girl.

30
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:02,186
How'd it get started?

31
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:05,690
Tommy started it in '92. 1992.

32
00:05:05,731 --> 00:05:07,525
He started off
by hisself at first.

33
00:05:07,577 --> 00:05:09,308
What's up, baby?

34
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,946
Come on, you guys.
You guys ready to party?

35
00:05:11,988 --> 00:05:14,073
When he first started out,
he had a little black bucket...

36
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:16,492
and had his little sign
on the side.

37
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:19,245
He was just starting out,
but he's come a long way.

38
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,330
All you hear is,
"Tommy, Tommy dancing.

39
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,624
"Tommy this. Tommy that.
I wanna go to Tommy Academy."

40
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:24,824
I have a ten-year-old son...

41
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:26,878
that's trying to get
into the academy.

42
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:28,828
So I think
that it's wonderful...

43
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,132
and he needs to keep up
the good work...

44
00:05:31,174 --> 00:05:33,217
and he needs to be commended for
the things that he's doing...

45
00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:34,635
for the black community,
Hispanics.

46
00:05:34,677 --> 00:05:36,220
He has marvelous parties...

47
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:38,598
so somebody need to call
and give a party...

48
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,726
'cause he give bomb parties.

49
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,645
Tommy is a ghetto celebrity,
'cause you're gonna see Tommy...

50
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,397
somewhere
in your neighborhood...

51
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:49,400
in the middle of your streets,
waking you up...

52
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:51,235
because his music gonna be loud.

53
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:55,531
When my mom was in jail,
he took me in...

54
00:05:55,573 --> 00:05:58,190
and he made sure
I got to school.

55
00:05:58,242 --> 00:06:01,204
Whatever I needed,
he made sure I was OK.

56
00:06:01,245 --> 00:06:02,538
If I wasn't dancing for Tommy...

57
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,415
I'd probably be doing
some bad things right now.

58
00:06:04,457 --> 00:06:06,000
I fear for him sometimes,
though...

59
00:06:06,042 --> 00:06:07,627
'cause a lot of people
are jealous...

60
00:06:07,668 --> 00:06:09,170
and they're
really hatin' on him.

61
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:11,506
If something happened to him,
we'd all be right there.

62
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:13,049
We all gonna suffer.

63
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,550
He screams at us.

64
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:16,427
He screams, "You in trouble."

65
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:19,680
He basically,
you know, like a father.

66
00:06:19,722 --> 00:06:21,881
He was really there for me.

67
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,977
And I admire him for that.
I love him for that.

68
00:06:28,022 --> 00:06:29,982
See how you powder like that?

69
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:32,443
Then you got to get the lips.
You don't want it to smear.

70
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:33,736
So...

71
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:46,249
Yep. And that's it.

72
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,334
Once I put the powder on...

73
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:53,840
then you try to dust off some
of the white of the powder...

74
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,217
and there you have it.

75
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,719
Your color come back.

76
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,294
People always
used to say I act crazy.

77
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:33,421
I always did silly things.

78
00:07:33,462 --> 00:07:35,339
And this girl,
just out of the blue...

79
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,300
asked can I be a clown
at her birthday party.

80
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,759
And I was, like, "A clown?"

81
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,979
I pull up to
the neighborhood, jump out.

82
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,565
I start dancing,
walking on my hands, flippin'.

83
00:07:52,607 --> 00:07:53,774
Kids would run out the houses.

84
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:54,984
People would run out the houses.

85
00:07:55,026 --> 00:07:56,402
And I'll give 'em a card.

86
00:07:56,444 --> 00:07:58,696
"If you need a clown
for your birthday party...

87
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:00,948
"call Tommy the Clown,
the hip-hop dancing clown."

88
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,596
And it start spreadin'.

89
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,150
Happy birthday, Malik!

90
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:06,152
Y'all ready
to party with Malik...

91
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:08,206
- somebody say, "That's right."
- That's right!

92
00:08:08,247 --> 00:08:10,156
Y'all ready to have
some fun with Malik...

93
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:12,835
- say, "You know this, man."
- You know this, man!

94
00:08:12,877 --> 00:08:15,421
Everybody go and give Malik
some birthday hits.

95
00:08:15,463 --> 00:08:17,673
I'm just playin'.
I'm just playin'.

96
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:22,053
I'm just playin'. Y'all stop.
Y'all better back up.

97
00:08:22,094 --> 00:08:24,931
You have to remember.
I created this on my own.

98
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:27,183
I started from the ground up.

99
00:08:27,225 --> 00:08:30,394
No one offered me no money.
No one gave me a dime.

100
00:08:30,446 --> 00:08:33,564
But I'm perceived to be
the richest man on Earth...

101
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,483
and ain't got a dime.

102
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,401
You ready for that?

103
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:41,239
Let me see you break it down.

104
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,241
You ain't gonna break it down?

105
00:08:43,282 --> 00:08:45,243
Back in the days,
I had my share...

106
00:08:45,284 --> 00:08:49,372
of being, I guess you
can say, a drug dealer...

107
00:08:49,413 --> 00:08:53,417
coming out here and
gettin' involved with drugs.

108
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:55,253
I came out here
to become big time...

109
00:08:55,305 --> 00:08:56,671
because I saved my money...

110
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:59,132
and was like one
of the big drug dealers...

111
00:08:59,173 --> 00:09:01,134
where I got
my nice cars and stuff.

112
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,052
And I always liked
to show off...

113
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:05,429
to say, "Man, look what
I have gotten," you know?

114
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:06,806
That was back then.

115
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:09,183
I always say God
gave me the opportunity...

116
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:11,435
'cause either you end up
shot, dead, and killed...

117
00:09:11,477 --> 00:09:12,979
or you go to jail.

118
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,022
And thank God
that I went to jail.

119
00:09:15,064 --> 00:09:16,555
And when I went to jail...

120
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:19,110
I said, "This is not
the place for me"...

121
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:20,486
and I changed my life.

122
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:23,281
I prayed. I asked God
to give me another chance.

123
00:09:23,322 --> 00:09:26,242
I didn't know
I was saving kids' lives.

124
00:09:26,284 --> 00:09:28,494
But if you look at it,
yes, you are...

125
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:30,705
'cause that kid
come dance with you...

126
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:31,664
who wouldn't dance with you...

127
00:09:31,706 --> 00:09:33,374
and you were straight
to that kid.

128
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,294
"Hey, I catch you in a gang,
you are in trouble.

129
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:38,530
"If I catch you
even claiming anything...

130
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:40,715
"I don't want you
to wear them colors."

131
00:09:40,756 --> 00:09:42,758
And they listen to me,
and they do it.

132
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,489
So I guess you could say
that saved his life...

133
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,179
because if they would've
wore that color...

134
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,181
they would've went over
to that neighborhood...

135
00:09:48,222 --> 00:09:50,141
they would've got shot,
they would've been dead.

136
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,101
It's the bottom line.

137
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:53,936
Everybody say break it down

138
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:54,896
Break it down

139
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:55,938
Say, "Break it down"

140
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:56,898
Break it down

141
00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:57,982
Say, "Break it down"

142
00:09:58,024 --> 00:09:59,358
Break it down

143
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,360
Bam. OK, it's about to get down,
y'all. Check this out.

144
00:10:07,992 --> 00:10:09,285
As I started gettin' older...

145
00:10:09,327 --> 00:10:11,746
I started lookin'
at the way these kids dance...

146
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:13,279
and I started grabbin' 'em.

147
00:10:13,331 --> 00:10:16,282
I had another girl,
another guy...

148
00:10:16,334 --> 00:10:18,753
and then it just started
spreading like that.

149
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,113
Larry is, like...

150
00:11:27,155 --> 00:11:29,282
one of the oldest
clown members that I have.

151
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:31,409
I consider him
to be my right-hand man...

152
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,703
'cause he been with me
through day one.

153
00:11:38,332 --> 00:11:40,626
Tommy is
a father figure to Larry.

154
00:11:40,668 --> 00:11:42,545
Sometimes, when Larry
get off the ringer...

155
00:11:42,587 --> 00:11:44,422
and have the attitudes
and be way-out crazed...

156
00:11:44,464 --> 00:11:46,174
I say, "OK, that's it."
That's my threat.

157
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,300
See, that's my weapon... Tommy.

158
00:11:47,341 --> 00:11:49,177
I say, "OK, that's it.
Let me get the phone.

159
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:51,262
"Let me call Tommy right now,
see now what time it is.

160
00:11:51,314 --> 00:11:52,305
"No more clowning for you."

161
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:54,891
I say, "OK, Tommy,
your son is off the ringer."

162
00:11:54,932 --> 00:11:57,310
So I tell him now. Tommy say,
"Yeah, I wanna talk to Larry."

163
00:11:57,351 --> 00:12:00,396
I say, "Well, that's your son.
Holler at him."

164
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:03,399
'Cause to tell the truth,
he has more control.

165
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:05,943
Tommy have Larry in the palm
of his hands right now.

166
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:08,738
I have been
Larry dad for a long time...

167
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:10,490
to where if he's slippin'
in school and grades...

168
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:12,033
I have to smash on him
and let him know...

169
00:12:12,074 --> 00:12:14,410
"Hey, come here and do
your homework, homie"...

170
00:12:14,452 --> 00:12:15,786
and if you get to where I say...

171
00:12:15,828 --> 00:12:17,955
"Hey, you can't clown
this weekend and next week"...

172
00:12:18,007 --> 00:12:19,071
it hurts, you know?

173
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:20,333
'Cause they love to do it.

174
00:12:23,044 --> 00:12:26,255
Hey, I want him to be a Blood
or I want him to be a Crip...

175
00:12:26,297 --> 00:12:29,050
"No, I'm not gonna be either.
I wanna be a Clown."

176
00:12:29,091 --> 00:12:30,551
That's how
he separated hisself...

177
00:12:30,593 --> 00:12:32,637
from all the bullcrap
out here in Holly-Watts.

178
00:12:32,678 --> 00:12:36,265
Most of my family is, like,
on this block, city of Watts.

179
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:39,811
Man, we... we right here
in the... in the lion's den...

180
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:41,145
the pit of snakes.

181
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:43,147
What's up, Little George?

182
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:44,190
This is my little brother
Little George.

183
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:45,149
Come here, George.

184
00:12:45,191 --> 00:12:47,099
We have all the gangs
on one side...

185
00:12:47,151 --> 00:12:49,028
and then you have the Clowns
on the other side.

186
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,239
They gonna ask you,
"Who do you dance with?"

187
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,407
Or they gonna be, like,
"What set you from?"

188
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:55,409
So that's why it's either
a gang or a clown group.

189
00:12:56,828 --> 00:12:59,831
Dance with a clown group,
they go on about their business.

190
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,875
They go about their business,
don't bother you too much.

191
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,670
Larry is over here
with the clowns.

192
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,463
I thank God for that.

193
00:13:07,505 --> 00:13:09,132
George, when you gonna
start dancin'?

194
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:12,135
You know it's like
a family tradition.

195
00:13:12,176 --> 00:13:13,959
Granny used to be a clown, too.

196
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:16,295
I'm so glad they came out
with this clown thing...

197
00:13:16,347 --> 00:13:18,599
'cause ain't no tellin' where
the kids would really be...

198
00:13:18,641 --> 00:13:20,309
or what would they be doing.

199
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,936
What else is there to do?

200
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:24,730
The clown thing
is a big part of L.A.

201
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:25,898
Everybody want to be a clown.

202
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,942
Everybody... everybody's
into the clownin'.

203
00:13:27,984 --> 00:13:30,194
What is a clown group?

204
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,883
A clown group is...

205
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,479
Birthday parties.

206
00:13:33,531 --> 00:13:36,075
How do I put it?
A clown group is...

207
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,650
Makin' people happy.

208
00:13:37,702 --> 00:13:39,662
Is a group of people
entertaining...

209
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:41,956
Makin' smiles where
there were no smiles...

210
00:13:41,998 --> 00:13:43,489
laughter where
there was no laughter.

211
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,252
See, a lot of clown groups
don't have the entertainment.

212
00:13:46,294 --> 00:13:48,921
You can't just go out there
and just dance, dance, dance.

213
00:13:48,963 --> 00:13:51,215
People don't wanna see that.
They wanna see a show.

214
00:13:51,257 --> 00:13:52,717
You have to, like,
love doin' it.

215
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,051
You can't just say...

216
00:13:54,093 --> 00:13:56,179
"Uh, I'm gonna do it
'cause I know how to dance."

217
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,222
It's, like, something
you have to have love for.

218
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:00,537
It's like a getaway.
You know what I mean?

219
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,810
You get to travel
from here to there...

220
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:04,395
see, meet different people.

221
00:14:04,437 --> 00:14:07,940
And some people don't even
get out their own neighborhood.

222
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:11,402
People say, "Why you still
dancin' with Tommy the Clown?"

223
00:14:11,444 --> 00:14:12,518
You know what I'm sayin'?

224
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,113
Because I want to.
I like to do this.

225
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:15,615
I been doin' this
since I was 12.

226
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:17,690
I'm 18 now, you know?

227
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:19,952
So I'm gettin' older,
and I like entertaining.

228
00:14:19,994 --> 00:14:20,912
You know what I'm saying?

229
00:14:20,953 --> 00:14:22,413
This is one of my dreams
I wanna pursue...

230
00:14:22,455 --> 00:14:23,414
is to be an entertainer.

231
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:26,375
I can do my dance thing.
I can be funny.

232
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:30,546
I can make people laugh.
I can meet new people.

233
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:34,050
I can...

234
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:37,710
make myself a name
to where people know who I am...

235
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:43,100
and give me my respect for just
doing something positive...

236
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:45,853
and not going negative.

237
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:48,064
'Cause if I wasn't doin'
this clown shit...

238
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:50,233
I honestly think
I'd have probably been...

239
00:14:50,274 --> 00:14:53,694
a very, very, very bad person.

240
00:14:53,736 --> 00:14:54,821
Yo, Tommy.

241
00:14:56,197 --> 00:14:59,367
Would you happen
to remember Celestine?

242
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:01,702
No. Who is this?

243
00:15:01,744 --> 00:15:03,621
I told you he don't remember.

244
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:05,832
No. How you doin'?
I remember you.

245
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:07,875
- What you been up to, girl?
- Nothin'.

246
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:08,876
When they let you out of jail?

247
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,628
Oh, this ain't...

248
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,339
Oh, my bad. I thought...
Ain't this the one?

249
00:15:13,381 --> 00:15:15,341
Well, she look like her.

250
00:15:15,383 --> 00:15:17,552
I wanna see you...

251
00:15:17,593 --> 00:15:19,095
Go, shorty

252
00:15:19,137 --> 00:15:20,346
It's your birthday

253
00:15:20,388 --> 00:15:22,598
We gonna party
like it's your birthday

254
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,475
We gonna sip Bacardi like...

255
00:15:24,517 --> 00:15:25,518
Hold on, baby. Hold on.

256
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:29,897
No. No, baby. We not gonna
sip no Bacardi, sweetheart.

257
00:17:39,777 --> 00:17:41,925
- Blow it out.
- I know it hurts.

258
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,073
That's all right.
That's all right.

259
00:17:44,115 --> 00:17:45,116
And we gonna sing it for you...

260
00:17:45,168 --> 00:17:46,075
Let it out.

261
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:48,536
Right here, right now.

262
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:50,913
And it goes
a little somethin' like this.

263
00:17:50,955 --> 00:17:53,374
Happy birthday

264
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:55,074
dear Liza

265
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:56,169
Oh, yes, indeed

266
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,712
I don't need y'all to clap

267
00:17:57,753 --> 00:17:59,881
'Cause we know we can sing, yeah

268
00:17:59,922 --> 00:18:02,049
I'm not talkin' to you... ou... ou

269
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:05,887
Y'all better clap.
That's the end of the song.

270
00:18:08,681 --> 00:18:11,184
How many clown groups are there?

271
00:18:12,852 --> 00:18:14,729
You have House of Clowns.

272
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,856
This is Homeboy the Clown
Entertainment right here.

273
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:18,232
Cartoonz Clowns.

274
00:18:18,274 --> 00:18:19,609
This is
Hard 'N' the Paint Clowns.

275
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,402
Check it out.
This is that one and only...

00:18:21,454 --> 00:18:23,154

World Wide Clowns.

278
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:27,606
Get Em Up Clowns.

279
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:31,120
We were Get Em Up Clowns.
Now it's Get Em Up Soldiers.

280
00:18:31,162 --> 00:18:33,623
Just Clownin'. Platinum Clowns.

281
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:36,125
What's up?
There's No Comparison.

282
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:37,752
We're Nan Nutta.

283
00:18:37,794 --> 00:18:38,920
Big X, you know what I'm sayin'?

284
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,839
A.k.a. Cereal Man,
you know, Froot Loop Man.

285
00:18:41,881 --> 00:18:43,382
You know what I'm sayin'?

286
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:44,634
Rice Track Clowns.

287
00:18:44,675 --> 00:18:46,052
Holler back.

288
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,850
Titanium Clowns.

289
00:18:52,892 --> 00:18:54,769
I'd say about 50.

290
00:18:54,811 --> 00:18:56,813
About 50 clown groups.
Different clown groups.

291
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,981
There's, like, over 50.

292
00:18:59,023 --> 00:19:00,316
Basically,
it's a bunch of kids...

293
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:01,859
that do the stripper dance,
paint their faces like clowns...

294
00:19:01,901 --> 00:19:03,736
and go put on a show
for a birthday party.

295
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,154
What's stripper dance?

296
00:19:05,196 --> 00:19:06,823
What's the stripper dance?

297
00:19:06,864 --> 00:19:08,491
What's the stripper dance?

298
00:19:13,204 --> 00:19:14,956
I don't know where the stripper
dance just came from.

299
00:19:14,997 --> 00:19:16,165
It just jumped into the air.

300
00:19:21,212 --> 00:19:22,692
One day, I didn't even know.

301
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,173
Like, I went to a party...

302
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:25,800
and that was,
like, the new dance.

303
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:34,892
The stripper dance is like where
you open both of your legs...

304
00:19:34,944 --> 00:19:36,602
and you bend like this.

305
00:19:36,644 --> 00:19:38,896
And then you gotta be making
your butt bounce like that.

306
00:19:38,938 --> 00:19:41,190
But it really be bouncin'.

307
00:19:44,068 --> 00:19:45,736
It be like a lotta guys
be lookin', like...

308
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:47,196
"Oh, she's hot. She's bangin'."

309
00:19:47,238 --> 00:19:48,573
So I do the stripper dance...

310
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:50,575
and I combined it
with a little clownin'...

311
00:19:50,616 --> 00:19:52,535
so I do the stripper,
and I do it like this...

312
00:19:52,577 --> 00:19:53,828
this just stripper plain.

313
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,997
But then I wobble with it,
like, wobble...

314
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:58,833
and that's the clownin'
and the stripper dance together.

315
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,792
'Cause I'm...

316
00:20:01,544 --> 00:20:04,088
Anybody out in Los Angeles,
you have to be taught it.

317
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,090
Out here, it's a flow.
It's a vibe.

318
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,039
It's like a connection.

319
00:20:07,091 --> 00:20:09,708
Everybody does it.
Everybody sees it.

320
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,929
We do everything.
We'll Harlem shake for you.

321
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,265
We'll bounce.
We'll do our little thing.

322
00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:16,934
We'll do our little swingin'.
We'll put everything in it.

323
00:20:16,986 --> 00:20:19,312
The bleach and
the little African clown walk.

324
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:20,521
We'll do it all.

325
00:20:20,563 --> 00:20:22,607
The stripper dance
has everything in it.

326
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:28,566
I've seen some parents
see the little 4-year-olds...

327
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,849
out there poppin'
their booties...

328
00:22:29,901 --> 00:22:32,111
and like, "I would never
let my daughter do that."

329
00:22:32,153 --> 00:22:33,696
"Why? She's out there
having fun.

330
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:36,616
"She's not doing anything wrong.
She's not being sexual.

331
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:37,617
"There's nobody
out there with her.

332
00:22:37,658 --> 00:22:39,118
"There's nobody touching her.

333
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:42,038
"She's out there poppin'.
What's wrong with poppin'?"

334
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,880
You have stripper dancing,
which we do not do.

335
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:52,048
Twerking.

336
00:22:52,089 --> 00:22:55,802
You have... you have...
you have clown dancing...

337
00:22:55,843 --> 00:22:57,929
and then you have
the krump dancing.

338
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,096
It's like hygiene.

339
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:00,681
Either you smell good,
or you don't.

340
00:23:00,723 --> 00:23:01,974
Either you krump, or you not.

341
00:23:02,016 --> 00:23:03,976
Basically,
we're from the inner city...

342
00:23:04,028 --> 00:23:05,937
what you would call it
the ghetto...

343
00:23:05,978 --> 00:23:08,168
you know, the lower parts
of Los Angeles...

344
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,358
Watts, east side of L.A.,
Compton, Long Beach.

345
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:11,901
We don't get the best
of everything.

346
00:23:11,943 --> 00:23:13,653
So what we do, we come together,
and we dance.

347
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:10,209
We don't have
after-school programs.

348
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:12,253
When you don't wanna
do football...

349
00:24:12,295 --> 00:24:14,297
because that's pretty much
the only thing...

350
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:15,590
that you can do
in the inner city.

351
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:16,924
There's always a football team.

352
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:18,124
Because in the inner city...

353
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,345
we're all thought of to be
sports players, you know.

354
00:24:21,397 --> 00:24:22,638
Everyone is not a sports player.

355
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,599
Everyone
does not play basketball...

356
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,465
and everybody
does not play football.

357
00:24:26,517 --> 00:24:29,187
There... Is there something
else for us to do?

358
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:32,690
So what we did is...
is a group of us got together...

359
00:24:32,732 --> 00:24:34,108
and we invented this.

360
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,444
In better neighborhoods...

361
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:39,009
they have
performing arts schools.

362
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,532
You have ballet,
you have modern...

363
00:24:41,574 --> 00:24:44,202
you have jazz,
you have tap...

364
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:46,454
and this is all those
prestigious academies...

365
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:48,080
you can go to.

366
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:49,582
It's nothing like that
available to you...

367
00:24:49,624 --> 00:24:52,335
when you live where we live.

368
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:55,630
I grew up around here...
Menlo, Normandie...

369
00:24:55,671 --> 00:24:57,131
I grew up in this area.

370
00:24:57,173 --> 00:25:00,510
It's real hard for kids like me,
'cause, OK, you have school.

371
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:02,678
You go to school,
but you have gangbangers...

372
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,223
and you can't even wear
certain colors around here.

373
00:25:05,275 --> 00:25:07,840
So you tend to have an outlet...

374
00:25:07,892 --> 00:25:08,935
and sometimes...
well, most of the time...

375
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,144
your outlet is music.

376
00:25:10,186 --> 00:25:11,187
This is where a lot of music...

377
00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:12,897
And you just think
of stuff in your head...

378
00:25:12,949 --> 00:25:14,065
it goes through your mind...

379
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,484
and a lot of times,
dancing comes out.

380
00:25:16,526 --> 00:25:18,736
When you know
that there's a krump session...

381
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:20,947
me, myself, and I know
a lot of people...

382
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:23,574
will stop whatever is going on
if there's a gathering...

383
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:24,857
because it's the spirit
that's there.

384
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:27,578
There's a spirit in...
In the midst of krumpness...

385
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:30,540
there is a spirit there,
you know.

386
00:25:30,581 --> 00:25:33,417
A lot of people think
it's just, you know...

387
00:25:33,469 --> 00:25:35,628
"Oh, they're just
a bunch of rowdy...

388
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,258
"you know, just ghetto,
just heathen and thugs."

389
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:44,011
No. No, what we are
are oppressed.

390
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,692
It's more of the...
not the black sheep...

391
00:26:39,734 --> 00:26:41,777
but just a raw version.

392
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:44,530
Like, you have organized ball,
then you have street ball.

393
00:26:44,572 --> 00:26:46,407
Krumping is the street ball.

394
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:48,242
You have a boy who gets krump...

395
00:26:48,284 --> 00:26:51,621
and just coincidentally,
his girlfriend gets krump.

396
00:26:51,662 --> 00:26:54,957
They face off. It's the
classic battle of the sexes.

397
00:26:54,999 --> 00:26:56,646
And that's what makes it like...

398
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,294
"Oh, my God.
Females do this, too?"

399
00:26:58,336 --> 00:26:59,629
It looks like we're
fighting somebody...

400
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:01,464
but we're not fighting anybody.

401
00:27:01,506 --> 00:27:04,258
Like, you can push somebody,
but they see nothing of it.

402
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,011
Fighting is the last thing
on our mind when we're dancing.

403
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,596
It is the last thing.

404
00:27:50,346 --> 00:27:53,266
The style changes,
believe it or not, every day.

405
00:27:53,307 --> 00:27:55,560
Every day, the style changes.

406
00:27:55,601 --> 00:27:58,062
And if you haven't
danced in two days...

407
00:27:58,104 --> 00:28:00,398
if you come to a krump session,
we're gonna know.

408
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,732
"What did I miss?"

409
00:28:01,774 --> 00:28:03,693
"You've been slacking off.
Go home."

410
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:05,194
Once you see the real thing...

411
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:07,071
you're gonna know
it's the real thing.

412
00:28:07,113 --> 00:28:08,823
You're gonna know.

413
00:28:08,865 --> 00:28:11,054
You're gonna be, like, "That has
to be the real thing...

414
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,244
"because I will never see
anything like this again."

415
00:28:13,286 --> 00:28:15,580
When they dance,
you know it's on.

416
00:28:15,621 --> 00:28:18,749
Especially if you have somebody
that's wildin' out like...

417
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:19,709
krumping themselves out.

418
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,335
It gets the girls more amped...

419
00:28:21,377 --> 00:28:23,171
to get out there
and handle their business.

420
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:24,703
Some of us may look gritty.

421
00:28:24,755 --> 00:28:27,383
Some of us may not have
the prettiest smiles.

422
00:28:27,425 --> 00:28:29,969
You know what I'm saying?
But we are krumping.

423
00:28:30,011 --> 00:28:31,679
That's the part
of what makes us krump.

424
00:28:31,721 --> 00:28:33,306
It seems
a little bit aggressive...

425
00:28:33,347 --> 00:28:35,349
but it's a good way
to take out your anger...

426
00:28:35,391 --> 00:28:37,393
when you go through stuff
in your personal life.

427
00:28:37,602 --> 00:28:39,061
But say people have problems...

428
00:28:39,103 --> 00:28:40,980
you know, didn't get this,
didn't get that.

429
00:28:41,022 --> 00:28:43,024
Short on this bill.
Short on that bill.

430
00:28:43,065 --> 00:28:45,026
Just the fact
that you can get krump...

431
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,986
you can channel that anger.

432
00:28:47,028 --> 00:28:49,947
Anything negative that has
happened in your life...

433
00:28:49,989 --> 00:28:52,200
you can channel that
into your dancing...

434
00:28:52,241 --> 00:28:54,410
and you can release that
in a positive way...

435
00:28:54,452 --> 00:28:57,747
because you're releasing it
through art, the art of dance.

436
00:28:57,789 --> 00:28:58,998
This is our ghetto ballet.

437
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,208
This is how
we express ourselves.

438
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:02,908
This is the only way
we see fit of storytelling.

439
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,839
This is the only way of making
ourselves feel like we belong.

440
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:13,387
If I know someone is looking
at me, it's gonna be hard.

441
00:29:13,429 --> 00:29:16,224
Some people can't dance if they
have someone looking at them.

442
00:29:16,265 --> 00:29:19,664
But if you know there's a mask
sort of covering your face...

443
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:23,064
you know, then you feel that
it's just you by yourself...

444
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:25,233
and that your identity
is hidden...

445
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:27,401
so you can dance
as freely as you want to.

446
00:29:27,443 --> 00:29:29,987
There's not just a bunch
of people acting wild.

447
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,936
This is an art form.

448
00:29:30,988 --> 00:29:33,157
It's just as valid
as your ballet...

449
00:29:33,199 --> 00:29:35,284
as your waltz,
as your tap dance.

450
00:29:35,326 --> 00:29:37,829
Except we wouldn't have
to go to school for this...

451
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:40,289
'cause it was already
implanted in us... from birth.

452
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:08,623
Tell us what's happening.

453
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:12,835
What happened? Tell me.

454
00:33:12,877 --> 00:33:14,545
She just struck.

455
00:33:14,587 --> 00:33:16,506
It's what
we all been waiting on.

456
00:33:16,547 --> 00:33:18,216
Yep.

457
00:33:18,257 --> 00:33:20,593
She has reached...

458
00:33:20,635 --> 00:33:23,012
That's what all of us
been waiting on.

459
00:33:30,228 --> 00:33:31,437
I marked my grandfather.

460
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:34,232
That was the first battle
I really won.

461
00:33:34,284 --> 00:33:35,900
Before he a preach...

462
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:39,278
he would sing a song, "Lord,
Lift Me Up and Let Me Stand."

463
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,115
So I just followed
the words to that song...

464
00:33:43,157 --> 00:33:46,577
but I was really dancing to
the song that I was dancing to.

465
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:49,997
But I was just... In my mind,
I was dancing to those words.

466
00:33:51,916 --> 00:33:53,835
I live with Reverend Turner.

467
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,482
He was always there.

468
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,036
I miss my family...

469
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:59,966
because that is my family,
my blood family.

470
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:02,468
But on the other side,
I still...

471
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,346
when I need
a family to go to...

472
00:34:05,388 --> 00:34:08,182
I have my church family
to come to.

473
00:34:08,224 --> 00:34:12,436
Clown groups are,
in a real sense, like families.

474
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:14,220
We laugh together.
We cry together.

475
00:34:14,272 --> 00:34:16,274
We go through... Whatever
one person goes through...

476
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,254
that whole group
goes through it.

477
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,194
Me and my homie,
Baby Tight Eyez...

478
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:21,571
we went to school together.

479
00:34:21,612 --> 00:34:24,198
He played instruments,
and I was always dancing.

480
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:25,575
It was this one performance...

481
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:27,910
when I got into this whole
clown dancing thing.

482
00:34:27,952 --> 00:34:30,163
I was just beginning.
I seen him perform...

483
00:34:30,204 --> 00:34:33,541
and I was already labeled
as the tightest clown dancer.

484
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:36,294
I said to myself,
"I want him to be under me.

485
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:38,754
"I wanted to take him under
my wing so I can train him."

486
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:41,507
'Cause I think he got potential
to be just as tight as I am...

487
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:43,926
because I see some
of my characteristics in him.

488
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,252
I knew about his background
before I knew him...

489
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:49,307
'cause people would tell me,
"This dude has problems.

490
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,559
"He doesn't go to school.
He has no clothes.

491
00:34:51,601 --> 00:34:53,769
"His brother stays
in and out of jail."

492
00:34:53,811 --> 00:34:54,729
I used to be like that.

493
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,273
My moms, she... she in jail.

494
00:34:57,315 --> 00:35:01,193
She in jail 'cause...
she don't wanna live right.

495
00:35:01,245 --> 00:35:05,072
She been smoking dope
for as long as I know...

496
00:35:05,114 --> 00:35:08,659
since I was a baby,
since before I was born.

497
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:09,827
He's had a lot of obstacles.

498
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:13,279
His mom, um,
had a drug problem...

499
00:35:13,331 --> 00:35:18,085
and he's had to face a lot of
challenges as a young person...

500
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:20,838
more so
than the average young person...

501
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,466
who has the advantage
a having a mom who was sober...

502
00:35:23,508 --> 00:35:25,134
or a dad who was sober.

503
00:35:25,176 --> 00:35:26,844
He calls me mom, you know...

504
00:35:26,886 --> 00:35:29,055
but not just his mom,
his play mom...

505
00:35:29,096 --> 00:35:30,973
but I'm proud to be his pastor.

506
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,810
My dad, he was my idol...

507
00:35:33,851 --> 00:35:37,188
'cause I never saw
a man do so much...

508
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:40,566
and make so much
of the day like he did.

509
00:35:40,608 --> 00:35:42,777
I saw him
as a father figure...

510
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:44,946
and a role model
at the same time.

511
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:48,241
He was my friend, also.

512
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:50,409
I see, like, lights
flashing in the back.

513
00:35:50,451 --> 00:35:52,495
Then my mom comes,
and she's telling me...

514
00:35:52,537 --> 00:35:55,373
she's like, "I'm gonna tell you
your dad committed suicide."

515
00:35:55,425 --> 00:35:56,582
You know...

516
00:35:56,624 --> 00:35:59,272
shot hisself in the head
in the backyard.

517
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:01,921
You know, came home,
we found him like this.

518
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:05,925
He was the only child
that kept it...

519
00:36:05,967 --> 00:36:08,010
kind of quietly inside of him.

520
00:36:08,052 --> 00:36:09,554
I felt as if...

521
00:36:09,595 --> 00:36:13,182
I was his only child
that didn't cry...

522
00:36:13,224 --> 00:36:15,560
you know, at the funeral
like everybody else did.

523
00:36:15,612 --> 00:36:17,854
I didn't, you know,
rant and rave.

524
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:20,148
So for a long time,
I thought, you know,

525
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:22,191
does that mean
I loved him any less?

526
00:36:22,233 --> 00:36:24,152
And I realized
it doesn't mean that.

527
00:36:24,193 --> 00:36:27,196
It's just that everybody
mourns in a different way.

528
00:36:27,238 --> 00:36:29,740
I've been in a lot
of family situations.

529
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:31,930
I've been shot
by a family member.

530
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,078
My grandfather
shot me in my arm.

531
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:38,708
Right here.

532
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:42,378
Went in through this way
and came out through here.

533
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,923
I was trying to protect
my mom 'cause he was drunk.

534
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:50,052
And I was looking at my body,
looking at my baby's body...

535
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,179
and I seen blood.

536
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,556
We didn't know where
the blood was coming from.

537
00:36:53,598 --> 00:36:56,601
Chance was standing
on the right side of me.

538
00:36:56,642 --> 00:36:59,604
I don't know how...
how the bullet hit me...

539
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:02,440
and the gun was pointed directly
to my little brother's back.

540
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,066
She was holding
my little brother.

541
00:37:04,108 --> 00:37:06,903
It must have been God,
'cause turned the bullet...

542
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,280
from when it hit the middle,
it must have turned the bullet.

543
00:37:09,332 --> 00:37:11,449
It ricocheted off
of something...

544
00:37:11,491 --> 00:37:13,659
and went straight
through my arm.

545
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,787
If the bullet
hadn't have turned...

546
00:37:15,828 --> 00:37:19,415
the bullet would have hit
my little baby.

547
00:37:19,457 --> 00:37:21,584
It would have tore him up.

548
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:24,837
But it turned, and it got him
right in this arm...

549
00:37:24,879 --> 00:37:27,089
and it went in, and it went out.

550
00:37:27,131 --> 00:37:29,258
I had to go to a crackhouse...

551
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,636
to get my mama
out of the crackhouse.

552
00:37:31,677 --> 00:37:33,971
That's not a good sight
to see as a kid.

553
00:37:34,013 --> 00:37:35,932
I don't remember how old I was.

554
00:37:35,973 --> 00:37:37,809
I just remember that vision.

555
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:42,480
It hurts, yeah, but that's
what I got krumpness for.

556
00:37:42,532 --> 00:37:44,273
That's why I get krump.

557
00:37:44,482 --> 00:37:48,903
Some people don't feel safe
outside of this place.

558
00:37:51,155 --> 00:37:53,658
I mean, I've seen a lot
of people come from Hollywood...

559
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,159
and come and visit
my home and be like...

560
00:37:55,201 --> 00:37:58,246
"How do you live here?
You live in South Central.

561
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:01,415
"Oh, it's so...
it's so dangerous."

562
00:38:01,457 --> 00:38:04,585
Like... it's not dangerous.
It's life.

563
00:38:04,627 --> 00:38:06,254
A lot of the kids out here...

564
00:38:06,295 --> 00:38:09,257
they don't have
that push or that drive...

565
00:38:09,298 --> 00:38:11,092
to go and be in Hollywood...

566
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:13,845
because so many people
have knocked them down already.

567
00:38:13,897 --> 00:38:16,222
So their comfort is the 'hood.

568
00:38:16,264 --> 00:38:18,307
It's scary to go to Hollywood...

569
00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:20,351
if you're coming
from the 'hood...

570
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:25,064
for the simple fact that
everything is so intimidating.

571
00:38:25,106 --> 00:38:27,650
When I first got
my first glance at Hollywood...

572
00:38:27,692 --> 00:38:29,735
everybody seemed
like this to me...

573
00:38:29,777 --> 00:38:32,488
and I felt like this...

574
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:35,992
Everybody's so uppity.

575
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:39,162
Everybody has so many things
going for themselves...

576
00:38:39,203 --> 00:38:40,496
and here I am.

577
00:38:40,538 --> 00:38:43,416
And that's how
the kids here feel.

578
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,751
We're just some...

579
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,732
some gutter kids.

580
00:38:47,784 --> 00:38:49,672
Tell me something.

581
00:38:49,714 --> 00:38:52,550
What has your big homie
in the gangbangin' world...

582
00:38:52,592 --> 00:38:54,927
done for you lately?

583
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,637
I don't have no big homie.

584
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:58,514
In a gangbanging world?

585
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:00,349
I'm just Baby Tight Eyez.

586
00:39:00,391 --> 00:39:02,101
I walked in a room...

587
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:04,770
and the boy
socked me in my head.

588
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:07,398
So I beat him up real, real bad.

589
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,566
That's what I did.

590
00:39:08,608 --> 00:39:11,068
What are you doing on the 5-5...

591
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:13,905
whatever hood street
you at, anyway?

592
00:39:13,957 --> 00:39:16,032
I went over there with my dad!

593
00:39:17,617 --> 00:39:20,328
Oh. So's your dad gangin' now?

594
00:39:20,369 --> 00:39:22,976
Daddy's been a gangbanger.

595
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:25,583
He just started back again?

596
00:39:25,625 --> 00:39:26,959
You could say that.

597
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:29,295
If I had to go in that 'hood,
as dangerous as it is...

598
00:39:29,337 --> 00:39:31,005
and tell them that...

599
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:34,884
that you not gonna be
a part of this gang, I will.

600
00:39:34,926 --> 00:39:36,719
If I have to go
to your school...

601
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:40,765
to show that you ain't
a part of this gang, I will.

602
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:42,183
I know I'm not
a parent or anything...

603
00:39:42,225 --> 00:39:44,519
but I feel like I have
to be an older mentor...

604
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,605
and a positive role model to
keep him on the right track...

605
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:49,106
'cause I know
that's all he needs.

606
00:39:49,148 --> 00:39:52,276
I know he looks up to me.
In some ways, I look up to him.

607
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:55,321
I never tell him that, but I do.

608
00:39:59,617 --> 00:40:03,746
So all we gonna do
is show him more love...

609
00:40:03,788 --> 00:40:05,998
and he'll overcome this.

610
00:40:08,793 --> 00:40:10,586
He needs to be somewhere
with me...

611
00:40:10,628 --> 00:40:12,296
whether his dad likes it or not.

612
00:40:12,338 --> 00:40:15,675
'Cause his dad doesn't even
look like he cares about him.

613
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,000
Krumpness is
the closed chapter...

614
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:34,212
of your life of hurt,
sorrow, anguish...

615
00:41:34,264 --> 00:41:36,923
that people don't know about.

616
00:41:36,964 --> 00:41:41,469
Kids these days
have a whole set of anxieties.

617
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:48,059
Maybe he's angry that he's
seen me work all my life.

618
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:50,603
We seem to be
in a standstill pattern.

619
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:54,899
Maybe he's angry
that he doesn't have a dad.

620
00:41:54,941 --> 00:41:56,692
He'll say,
"I just never envisioned...

621
00:41:56,734 --> 00:42:00,029
"that dad wouldn't be here."

622
00:42:50,663 --> 00:42:52,623
Hey, mama, look at this.

623
00:42:55,543 --> 00:42:58,004
"Baby, you're gonna give
yourself a heart attack!

624
00:42:58,045 --> 00:43:00,465
"You know you got asthma!
Who taught you that?"

625
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:02,091
Cartoonz, they was krump.

626
00:43:02,133 --> 00:43:06,179
I got a black eye.
They said it looked beautiful.

627
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,284
Mama, that's part of dancin'.

628
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,349
That's part of my moves. See?

629
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:12,643
They like it out there.

630
00:43:12,685 --> 00:43:13,769
They krump.

631
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:17,148
I used to be a dancer for Tommy.

632
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:19,192
I, too, as he said...

633
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:23,049
used to be one of
Tommy the Clown's dancers.

634
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:26,866
I thank Tommy the Clown
for doin' what he did...

635
00:43:26,908 --> 00:43:28,576
and startin' the movement...

636
00:43:28,618 --> 00:43:30,640
but what we do now
is totally different.

637
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:32,663
"I thank Tommy
for startin' the movement...

638
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:34,582
"but we do it different now."

639
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:37,835
No, you might do it
a little retarded, you know.

640
00:43:37,877 --> 00:43:41,047
It became boring,
and it's, like, you need more.

641
00:43:41,088 --> 00:43:42,131
You need more.

642
00:43:43,674 --> 00:43:45,760
Stop.

643
00:43:47,053 --> 00:43:48,805
Let me alone.

644
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:53,476
I wanna get krump.

645
00:44:01,692 --> 00:44:06,113
And everybody that got skills,
I want you to go to the front.

646
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:08,866
If you're not dancing,
please go to the back.

647
00:44:08,918 --> 00:44:10,368
We need hot dancers
in the front.

648
00:44:10,409 --> 00:44:12,245
You look at gangbanging,
it's a competition.

649
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:13,704
The Crips go against the Bloods.

650
00:44:13,746 --> 00:44:15,748
They wanna be better than
each other, stuff like that.

651
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:17,500
So by this clown war
being created...

652
00:44:17,542 --> 00:44:19,293
and the BattleZone
being created...

653
00:44:19,335 --> 00:44:21,045
it's like
that same competition...

654
00:44:21,087 --> 00:44:22,463
but it's on the flip side.

655
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:25,883
Having so many clown groups,
somebody wants to be the best.

656
00:44:25,935 --> 00:44:27,718
You know, somebody
wants to be number one.

657
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,138
Somebody wants to be number 2.
Somebody wants to be noticed.

658
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:32,557
So that's how Tommy started
the thing called the BattleZone.

659
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:35,685
You know how battle-dancin'
was back in the days.

660
00:44:37,311 --> 00:44:39,897
I just brought it back.

661
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:41,357
With makeup.

662
00:44:47,071 --> 00:44:49,615
- BattleZone.
- BattleZone.

663
00:44:49,657 --> 00:44:52,577
It's like fightin',
like getting out your anger...

664
00:44:52,629 --> 00:44:55,204
but on the dance floor,
with creative moves.

665
00:44:55,246 --> 00:44:56,998
We have the little mama match...

666
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,960
where it's little mamas breakin'
it down, showin' skills.

667
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:02,920
The community
is, like, "Oh, my God."

668
00:45:02,972 --> 00:45:04,672
We got big boy match.

669
00:45:04,714 --> 00:45:07,383
We bring out the big people.

670
00:45:07,425 --> 00:45:08,759
You don't have
to worry about nothin'...

671
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:10,720
'cause you can do it, too.

672
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:17,935
These are matches
that we have inside of a ring...

673
00:45:17,987 --> 00:45:21,272
and the crowd, you be the judge.

674
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:22,482
The crowd judge.

675
00:45:22,523 --> 00:45:23,858
You know, millions watchin'.

676
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,360
I don't care if you get
out there and blink an eye.

677
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:28,279
You better blink that eye like
you never blinked it before.

678
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:29,447
You got to show your skills.

679
00:45:29,489 --> 00:45:30,573
To me, when I'm dancin'...

680
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:32,200
I don't care if the ugliness
come out or not...

681
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:34,243
'cause I'm dancin'. It's me.

682
00:45:34,285 --> 00:45:36,412
So that's the difference
between me and her.

683
00:45:36,454 --> 00:45:39,540
It's, like, a big difference
between La Niña and Miss Prissy.

684
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:41,292
When you say La Niña,
I was, like, "Whoa."

685
00:45:41,334 --> 00:45:44,587
When you say Miss Prissy,
you're thinking of, like...

686
00:45:44,629 --> 00:45:46,214
a pretty girl, like...
you know, like that.

687
00:45:46,255 --> 00:45:49,383
You'll see a side of Miss Prissy
you've never seen before.

688
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:51,469
I'm gonna be the total opposite
of my name...

689
00:45:51,521 --> 00:45:53,763
but that's how it happens.

690
00:45:53,805 --> 00:45:56,098
I'm prissy all day,
but at night...

691
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,309
it's something
totally different.

692
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:01,062
I never lost before. I don't
know how it feels to lose.

693
00:46:01,103 --> 00:46:03,773
They tellin' the people
that they better than us...

694
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:06,317
'cause, uh, they're
not with us no more?

695
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:09,028
We couldn't be centered anymore.

696
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:11,656
So you, they, them,
made Tommy? No.

697
00:46:11,697 --> 00:46:12,657
Different style of paint.

698
00:46:12,698 --> 00:46:13,699
November 15.

699
00:46:13,741 --> 00:46:15,076
Different style of dance.

700
00:46:15,118 --> 00:46:16,807
At the Great Western Forum,
baby.

701
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,496
Different style of everything.

702
00:46:18,538 --> 00:46:21,124
You goes down.

703
00:46:21,165 --> 00:46:23,376
I guarantee you that.

704
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:32,385
Here's your Oscar now.

705
00:46:32,426 --> 00:46:34,220
Tommy's got krump!

706
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:43,146
El Niño Boy,
you goin' down tonight.

707
00:46:43,187 --> 00:46:45,481
You goin' down. I see you
with your little bodyguards...

708
00:46:45,523 --> 00:46:46,941
but they gonna get beat up, too.

709
00:46:46,993 --> 00:46:48,359
Every time I think
about Larry...

710
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:49,861
it's like, oh, it's over.

711
00:46:49,902 --> 00:46:51,195
I ain't even started
dancing yet, and it's over.

712
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:17,305
I want everybody to win.
I want no losses, baby.

713
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:18,639
Whoever lose...

714
00:47:18,681 --> 00:47:21,517
I repeat: Whoever lose...

715
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:23,269
is out!

716
00:47:23,311 --> 00:47:25,438
I ain't gonna even
talk about it.

717
00:47:28,191 --> 00:47:31,944
There goes the game! Game over!

718
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,260
Hey, y'all, get ready.
Let's go. Let's line up.

719
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:12,003
If they beat us,
I'm gonna retire.

720
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,303
What would you do?
Just say it happened.

721
00:49:20,344 --> 00:49:23,306
If they beat me?

722
00:49:23,347 --> 00:49:26,267
Hey, I'll probably be
workin' at Vons with Larry.

723
00:50:09,894 --> 00:50:13,022
Let's get ready to rumble!

724
00:50:13,064 --> 00:50:16,108
Get ready to make some noise!

725
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:19,362
La Niña, you ready, girl?
We about to kick it off.

726
00:50:19,403 --> 00:50:21,239
Miss Prissy, you ready, girl?

727
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,865
We about to kick it off.

728
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,538
Let's make some noise for...

729
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:54,373
La Niña!

730
00:52:02,465 --> 00:52:06,719
Do me a favor and make
some noise for Miss Prissy!

731
00:52:17,188 --> 00:52:21,108
And the world-famous, undisputed
champion of the world...

732
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:25,446
is...

733
00:52:25,488 --> 00:52:29,158
Miss Prissy!

734
00:54:52,426 --> 00:54:54,053
Say, "Larry!"

735
00:54:54,095 --> 00:54:55,471
Larry!

736
00:54:55,513 --> 00:54:56,514
Say, "Larry!"

737
00:54:56,556 --> 00:54:57,557
Larry!

738
00:54:57,598 --> 00:54:58,724
Say, "Larry!"

739
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:16,803
Larry!

740
00:57:13,776 --> 00:57:19,740
Give it up for Lil Man!

741
00:57:24,787 --> 00:57:28,624
Give it up for Lil Mama!

742
00:57:41,053 --> 00:57:42,972
I cannot believe!

743
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:45,516
This is ludicrous.

744
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:05,119
It's all good.

745
00:58:05,161 --> 00:58:07,830
I ain't never got
to practice for nothin'.

746
00:58:07,872 --> 00:58:09,749
I came out there,
danced off my head...

747
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:11,667
and came up with
a beautiful show, baby.

748
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:13,085
A beautiful show.

749
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,232
They cheated my cousin.
They cheated all y'all.

750
00:58:34,273 --> 00:58:37,276
That's some bullshit.
That was weak.

751
00:58:37,318 --> 00:58:38,653
All them niggas is weak!

752
00:58:40,279 --> 00:58:42,406
All y'all battle! All y'all!

753
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:44,951
Battle! Right! Battle!

754
00:58:44,992 --> 00:58:48,287
You all did not win
all of the battles.

755
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:50,372
I'm gonna tell you that.

756
00:58:50,424 --> 00:58:52,416
You didn't win 'em all...

757
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:55,002
but you got cheated out
of about 3.

758
00:58:59,173 --> 00:59:00,831
Told y'all we were gonna do it!

759
00:59:00,883 --> 00:59:04,470
That wasn't no BattleZone.
That was a concert for Larry.

760
00:59:04,512 --> 00:59:05,805
And he won.

761
00:59:05,847 --> 00:59:07,098
We won! We won!

762
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,349
We won!

763
00:59:08,391 --> 00:59:10,643
Thank you, Jesus!

764
00:59:10,685 --> 00:59:12,895
How you doin'?

765
00:59:12,937 --> 00:59:14,105
Larry!

766
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,118
He probably worked
his ass off...

767
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,662
for about 3 weeks,
4 weeks or something.

768
00:59:29,704 --> 00:59:30,861
You know what I'm saying?

769
00:59:30,913 --> 00:59:32,457
I'm real with this.
I'm original.

770
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:33,916
Everything I do is pure.

771
00:59:33,958 --> 00:59:35,293
I don't have to practice it.

772
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:36,919
I don't have to want it.
I already got it.

773
00:59:36,961 --> 00:59:38,337
You know what I'm sayin'?

774
00:59:38,379 --> 00:59:41,007
And it's done.
I ain't got nothin' to say.

775
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:42,133
I'm done.

776
00:59:47,096 --> 00:59:49,682
Feel good to wear this, baby.

777
00:59:49,724 --> 00:59:52,477
Be all I am the way I am

778
00:59:52,529 --> 00:59:54,103
'Cause I'm...

779
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:25,051
Tell us... Tell us what happened.

780
01:00:25,092 --> 01:00:27,595
Somebody done broke into his...

781
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:29,639
Everything OK?

782
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,349
They just broke...
broke in my house.

783
01:00:31,390 --> 01:00:32,975
While we was on here
at the BattleZone...

784
01:00:33,017 --> 01:00:37,313
they broke in my house.
They thrashed everything.

785
01:00:37,355 --> 01:00:40,942
You try and work hard
for these people...

786
01:00:40,983 --> 01:00:43,194
but people
are always doin' stuff.

787
01:00:44,487 --> 01:00:47,990
Doin' stuff,
and they doin' this stuff.

788
01:00:48,032 --> 01:00:49,951
It's hard, man!

789
01:00:53,996 --> 01:00:58,000
They can't do that.
They can't do that.

790
01:00:58,042 --> 01:00:59,961
Stand over here, sir.

791
01:01:03,589 --> 01:01:06,092
While I was
winnin' the BattleZone...

792
01:01:06,134 --> 01:01:08,553
I was losing
BattleZone over here.

793
01:01:08,594 --> 01:01:09,846
They came in the house...

794
01:01:09,887 --> 01:01:11,430
broke in the house,
and took everything.

795
01:01:11,472 --> 01:01:12,849
The front door is over there?

796
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:14,392
No, the front door
and this door.

797
01:01:14,433 --> 01:01:15,685
This is the sliding door...

798
01:01:15,726 --> 01:01:17,645
and there's a door through
that washroom over there.

799
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:20,106
OK. I'm gonna check this out.

800
01:01:26,988 --> 01:01:29,532
You just have to know that...

801
01:01:29,574 --> 01:01:31,909
because you're doing
something right...

802
01:01:31,951 --> 01:01:33,786
this is happening.

803
01:01:33,828 --> 01:01:35,121
OK? These things happen...

804
01:01:35,163 --> 01:01:39,333
only when people do
something positive. OK?

805
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:42,378
And, you know,
you're trying to do...

806
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,339
something very good
for the children...

807
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:48,092
for the kids, and this is
unfortunate, but it is...

808
01:01:48,134 --> 01:01:49,177
Hey, baby.

809
01:01:49,218 --> 01:01:50,386
Hi, daddy.

810
01:01:50,428 --> 01:01:51,554
How you doin'?

811
01:01:51,596 --> 01:01:52,680
Fine.

812
01:01:52,722 --> 01:01:54,557
Yeah, I feel you.

813
01:01:54,599 --> 01:01:56,184
Daddy.

814
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:59,812
Th... there.

815
01:01:59,854 --> 01:02:02,210
There you go, daddy.

816
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:04,567
Something's missing.

817
01:02:04,609 --> 01:02:07,017
My DVD player gone.

818
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:09,447
Did you dust the front door?
Because that wouldn't...

819
01:02:09,489 --> 01:02:11,240
We dust the whole house, sir.

820
01:02:11,282 --> 01:02:12,784
We dust the whole house.

821
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:14,191
Don't trip. Forget this...

822
01:02:14,243 --> 01:02:17,330
'cause we fi'n
to get a mansion.

823
01:02:17,371 --> 01:02:20,082
We're gonna have a mansion
with everything we want in it.

824
01:02:20,124 --> 01:02:21,167
Amen.

825
01:02:21,209 --> 01:02:22,502
They can trash it...

826
01:02:22,543 --> 01:02:24,629
'cause we movin'
to bigger and better things.

827
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:26,672
Everything happens
for a reason...

828
01:02:26,714 --> 01:02:27,882
and that lets you know
we have to leave.

829
01:02:27,924 --> 01:02:29,050
Right.

830
01:02:29,091 --> 01:02:31,886
We have to get out of here.
That's all that is.

831
01:02:31,928 --> 01:02:33,429
They heard you weren't
movin' fast enough.

832
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,097
They was tryin' to help you.

833
01:02:35,139 --> 01:02:36,557
Everything happens for a reason.

834
01:02:36,599 --> 01:02:37,934
That's how you
got to look at it.

835
01:02:37,975 --> 01:02:38,883
I remember that.

836
01:02:38,935 --> 01:02:40,478
We fi'n to go in a mansion.

837
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,021
We're gonna have a 20-story.

838
01:02:42,063 --> 01:02:43,022
Let's go!

839
01:02:43,064 --> 01:02:45,942
Clownin' is cool,
but the hard part...

840
01:02:45,983 --> 01:02:48,361
is the life outside of clownin'.

841
01:02:48,402 --> 01:02:51,739
This is Inglewood.
So this is Inglewood.

842
01:02:51,781 --> 01:02:55,118
Inglewood is set up
to be a deadly place...

843
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:56,410
just like South Central.

844
01:02:56,452 --> 01:02:57,995
South Central is a deadly place.

845
01:02:58,037 --> 01:03:00,873
A couple of weeks ago,
we seen a guy get shot.

846
01:03:00,915 --> 01:03:03,709
First time I seen something
like that in my life.

847
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:05,002
We're drivin'.

848
01:03:05,044 --> 01:03:07,338
I'm in the truck.
I'm drivin' the truck.

849
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:08,506
Tommy's drivin' the 5.0.

850
01:03:08,548 --> 01:03:10,133
You know, he stops.

851
01:03:10,174 --> 01:03:12,468
He bent over
to pick up somethin'...

852
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:14,220
and soon as he leans back up,
we hear a shot.

853
01:03:15,304 --> 01:03:17,640
Man, laid out
on the corner right there.

854
01:03:17,682 --> 01:03:20,143
I ain't never seen
nothin' like that.

855
01:03:20,184 --> 01:03:22,228
Head blown all off.
All over the corner.

856
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,105
Drivin' down the street
from a school.

857
01:03:24,147 --> 01:03:25,940
We just finished
doing this preschool.

858
01:03:25,982 --> 01:03:28,776
All the kids, everybody saw it.

859
01:03:28,818 --> 01:03:31,571
It was just... too dramatic.

860
01:03:31,612 --> 01:03:34,407
Ain't nothin' for them
to do but to be bad.

861
01:03:34,449 --> 01:03:36,993
I mean, if you
grew up around people...

862
01:03:37,034 --> 01:03:40,079
that got a kick
out of hurtin' people...

863
01:03:40,131 --> 01:03:43,124
or got a kick out
of robbin' people...

864
01:03:43,166 --> 01:03:46,461
and that's all
around you 24/7 all day...

865
01:03:46,502 --> 01:03:48,921
that means eventually...

866
01:03:48,963 --> 01:03:51,632
you gonna start catching
a feel for it.

867
01:03:51,674 --> 01:03:53,885
It's so much violence
going on...

868
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:57,722
and, I mean, you know,
shootings, killings, I mean...

869
01:03:57,774 --> 01:04:00,433
you know, the kids just
need somethin' positive.

870
01:04:00,475 --> 01:04:02,101
The way life is out here...

871
01:04:02,143 --> 01:04:04,604
it's hard for you
to walk down a street...

872
01:04:04,645 --> 01:04:08,357
and not know that you're
not gonna get shot today.

873
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:12,278
You don't even have to be
part of a gang or whatever.

874
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:16,157
You could just be that person
walking to the store.

875
01:04:16,199 --> 01:04:17,950
Just walking
out in the street...

876
01:04:18,002 --> 01:04:19,702
you could get shot
for no reason.

877
01:04:19,744 --> 01:04:24,207
Just for looking like somebody,
you get shot.

878
01:04:49,482 --> 01:04:51,818
There she goes. There she goes!

879
01:04:59,575 --> 01:05:01,828
Family members of
15-year-old Quinesha Dunford...

880
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:03,746
say she simply
left home last night...

881
01:05:03,788 --> 01:05:05,581
to walk to the store
to buy a soda...

882
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:07,375
when she was gunned down.

883
01:05:07,416 --> 01:05:09,752
Her 13-year-old friend
who was walking with her...

884
01:05:09,794 --> 01:05:12,255
Demario Moore,
was also shot dead.

885
01:05:12,296 --> 01:05:14,006
Authorities say
for no apparent reason...

886
01:05:14,048 --> 01:05:15,633
known gang members
targeted the kids...

887
01:05:15,675 --> 01:05:18,678
and killed them as they
walked along 54th street...

888
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:21,681
between Budlong and
Normandie Avenues in south L.A.

889
01:05:21,722 --> 01:05:22,890
She was one of those victims...

890
01:05:22,932 --> 01:05:25,393
an innocent victim,
that go to practice...

891
01:05:25,434 --> 01:05:27,979
that do everything
that you supposed to do...

892
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,565
and was at the wrong place
at the wrong time...

893
01:05:30,606 --> 01:05:33,443
to say hi to somebody
across the light...

894
01:05:33,484 --> 01:05:35,528
when the store is right there.

895
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:39,490
From crazy people
runnin' the block...

896
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:43,578
shootin' out of a car, and
don't know who they shootin'.

897
01:05:43,619 --> 01:05:46,873
They shoot old people,
young people, babies.

898
01:05:46,914 --> 01:05:48,332
They didn't care.

899
01:05:48,374 --> 01:05:50,793
They came around the block
just shootin' people.

900
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:52,211
And she happened to be...

901
01:05:52,253 --> 01:05:54,297
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

902
01:05:54,338 --> 01:05:56,215
'Cause she had so much to do.

903
01:05:56,257 --> 01:05:59,051
She loved dancin'.
She loved drill team.

904
01:05:59,093 --> 01:06:01,846
She loved cheerleading.
She loved it all.

905
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:16,944
His father, I think,
was a old gang member, an O.G.

906
01:06:16,986 --> 01:06:20,740
And his father's enemies
was lookin' for somebody...

907
01:06:20,782 --> 01:06:23,701
and they shot at them.
Both of them got killed.

908
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:25,828
See, that just
make me feel like...

909
01:06:25,870 --> 01:06:27,538
I don't wanna be
in this place no more.

910
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,248
But you just can't leave.
This is my home.

911
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:35,963
Amazing grace

912
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:41,052
How sweet

913
01:06:41,093 --> 01:06:46,098
The sound

914
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:51,062
That saved

915
01:06:51,103 --> 01:06:56,754
A wretch

916
01:06:56,806 --> 01:07:02,359
Like me

917
01:07:02,411 --> 01:07:07,912
I once

918
01:07:07,954 --> 01:07:12,708
Was lost

919
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:17,296
But now

920
01:07:17,338 --> 01:07:21,759
I'm found

921
01:07:21,801 --> 01:07:26,222
I was blind

922
01:07:26,264 --> 01:07:30,601
But now

923
01:07:30,643 --> 01:07:33,604
I

924
01:07:33,646 --> 01:07:36,566
See

925
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:51,581
Austin Harris is my name.

926
01:07:51,622 --> 01:07:53,791
Selling caskets is my game.

927
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:56,711
I've been neighbors
to the clowns about 9 months...

928
01:07:56,752 --> 01:08:02,675
and we all get together
just fine.

929
01:08:02,717 --> 01:08:03,926
Lot of people think...

930
01:08:03,968 --> 01:08:06,053
the old folks the one
all doin' all the dyin'...

931
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:08,139
but you young folks
beatin' us out of here, boy.

932
01:08:08,181 --> 01:08:10,641
You know that?
You're killin' yourselves.

933
01:08:10,683 --> 01:08:12,977
Don't make sense.

934
01:08:13,019 --> 01:08:15,980
But anyway, to each his own.

935
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:19,150
You just tell your parents
where I am.

936
01:08:19,192 --> 01:08:20,359
When we throw
our club nights...

937
01:08:20,401 --> 01:08:21,319
Right.

938
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,560
After we throw our clubs...

939
01:08:22,612 --> 01:08:24,363
people be out there
hangin' out and everything...

940
01:08:24,405 --> 01:08:25,698
and drinkin',
whatever they doin'...

941
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:26,824
and they look in here...

942
01:08:26,866 --> 01:08:27,950
that's like givin'
them a message like...

943
01:08:27,992 --> 01:08:29,327
Right, right, right.

944
01:08:29,368 --> 01:08:30,870
OK, you have fun, but if
you clown around too much...

945
01:08:30,912 --> 01:08:32,830
you're gonna end up right here.

946
01:08:32,872 --> 01:08:34,957
Reality, it sets in.
It will. It will. You know.

947
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:36,459
You need to come
to the club, though.

948
01:08:36,501 --> 01:08:37,502
I do?

949
01:08:37,543 --> 01:08:39,545
You do, 'cause
I think you still got...

950
01:08:39,587 --> 01:08:40,838
Do a little boogie?

951
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,006
You still doin' a little boogie.

952
01:08:42,048 --> 01:08:44,383
Oh, yeah, well, I need that.
I used to do it.

953
01:08:44,425 --> 01:08:47,637
I mean, I done seen a lot
of things happen in my life.

954
01:08:47,678 --> 01:08:48,888
A whole lot.

955
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:50,890
And I'm only 20 years old.

956
01:08:50,932 --> 01:08:53,810
Swoop, horrible where he lives.

957
01:08:53,851 --> 01:08:55,394
Horrible, you know?

958
01:08:55,436 --> 01:08:58,314
And it's good that,
you know, he stopped...

959
01:08:58,356 --> 01:09:02,026
'cause he was... he was...
he was in that direction...

960
01:09:02,068 --> 01:09:05,655
but he twisted it,
he changed it, came to clownin'.

961
01:09:05,696 --> 01:09:08,157
Been here ever since,
which was good...

962
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:10,618
'cause he was there.
He was almost there.

963
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:13,287
Life is not a game.

964
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:14,997
That's right. I hear you.

965
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:16,165
I'm serious.

966
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:18,709
Take advantage of it
while you can.

967
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:20,211
Yeah, you better clown right.

968
01:09:20,253 --> 01:09:22,421
I know y'all's
some good clowns...

969
01:09:22,463 --> 01:09:24,090
but y'all better clown right.

970
01:09:24,132 --> 01:09:25,216
'Cause if you don't...

971
01:09:25,258 --> 01:09:26,634
I know where
you're gonna end up.

972
01:09:26,676 --> 01:09:27,885
Right here...

973
01:09:29,011 --> 01:09:31,514
with me.

974
01:09:31,556 --> 01:09:33,516
Go on in. Take a look.

975
01:09:33,558 --> 01:09:34,465
Not now.

976
01:09:34,517 --> 01:09:36,102
No, come on in here.
Come on.

977
01:09:36,144 --> 01:09:37,395
You wanna go in?

978
01:09:37,436 --> 01:09:39,939
Yeah. Find a casket
that's big enough for you.

979
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:42,525
We can have one special made.

980
01:09:42,567 --> 01:09:43,818
Don't worry.

981
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:53,035
I used to be... Back in the day,
I was a gangbanger.

982
01:09:53,077 --> 01:09:54,485
My mother and my father
were both addicts...

983
01:09:54,537 --> 01:09:57,165
so the only family I had was
the family in the streets...

984
01:09:57,206 --> 01:10:00,209
that showed me
what I thought was love.

985
01:10:00,251 --> 01:10:01,836
You know what I mean?

986
01:10:01,878 --> 01:10:03,463
It's like, "We loyal to you
and we sisters"...

987
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,506
and we're hangin' out and,
you know, kind of like...

988
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:07,175
a commitment,
we were down for each other.

989
01:10:07,216 --> 01:10:08,926
And sometimes, unfortunately...

990
01:10:08,968 --> 01:10:10,803
kids that don't get it
at home...

991
01:10:10,845 --> 01:10:12,472
have to go and get it
in the streets.

992
01:10:12,513 --> 01:10:14,056
And when they get it
in the streets...

993
01:10:14,098 --> 01:10:16,976
it's mistaken, because
in the end, nobody's ever there.

994
01:10:17,018 --> 01:10:20,146
On the streets, I found,
like, street mothers...

995
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:23,274
and street brothers
and street sisters, you know...

996
01:10:23,316 --> 01:10:25,026
that kind of looked out for me.

997
01:10:25,067 --> 01:10:27,403
At least I thought
they looked out for me.

998
01:10:27,445 --> 01:10:29,030
What happened?

999
01:10:29,071 --> 01:10:31,073
Well, I ended up
in some situations where...

1000
01:10:31,115 --> 01:10:33,701
where people ran out on me...

1001
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:37,914
when my life took a bad turn,
that they bailed out, you know.

1002
01:10:37,955 --> 01:10:39,749
I had a bout
with substance abuse...

1003
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:41,699
for about 15 years, you know.

1004
01:10:41,751 --> 01:10:44,754
And nobody was there in the end.
Nobody was there in the end.

1005
01:10:44,796 --> 01:10:46,255
And that's
when I had to turn to God.

1006
01:10:46,297 --> 01:10:47,757
I just said,
"God, please help me.

1007
01:10:47,799 --> 01:10:48,925
"I don't wanna die this way."

1008
01:10:48,966 --> 01:10:50,092
When did this happen?

1009
01:10:50,134 --> 01:10:51,542
6 years ago.

1010
01:10:51,594 --> 01:10:53,210
And so Dragon was around...

1011
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:57,225
Dragon was... Dragon took care
of his siblings...

1012
01:10:57,266 --> 01:10:59,060
when I went through my bout.

1013
01:10:59,101 --> 01:11:00,812
Dragon was father to these kids.

1014
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:03,106
Dragon would cook, clean,
get them to school.

1015
01:11:03,147 --> 01:11:04,690
And he was the father.

1016
01:11:04,732 --> 01:11:06,818
Statistically,
my kids should be messed up.

1017
01:11:06,859 --> 01:11:09,070
My kids are great.
They're obedient.

1018
01:11:09,112 --> 01:11:11,114
They're well-disciplined.
They're respectful.

1019
01:11:11,155 --> 01:11:13,783
And I got great kids, you know?

1020
01:11:15,326 --> 01:11:16,786
Dragon here.

1021
01:11:20,581 --> 01:11:22,166
Hey, old bat.

1022
01:11:22,208 --> 01:11:24,127
Don't say that.

1023
01:11:24,168 --> 01:11:26,045
Oh, Dragon.

1024
01:11:26,087 --> 01:11:28,589
Why'd you say that stuff
on the phone to me?

1025
01:11:28,631 --> 01:11:31,050
Thank you, Dragon.

1026
01:11:31,092 --> 01:11:33,970
The first time
I saw Dragon get krump...

1027
01:11:34,011 --> 01:11:35,930
I thought he was on drugs...

1028
01:11:35,972 --> 01:11:37,390
or maybe somebody had
given him somethin'.

1029
01:11:37,431 --> 01:11:39,517
He was just, like,
runnin' around...

1030
01:11:39,559 --> 01:11:41,352
and screamin,
tearin' off his clothes.

1031
01:11:41,394 --> 01:11:43,146
And I didn't know
what happened to him.

1032
01:11:43,187 --> 01:11:44,762
Then he explained to me...

1033
01:11:44,814 --> 01:11:46,274
that it was
a new form of dancing...

1034
01:11:46,315 --> 01:11:47,608
that kind of took 'em
back to their roots.

1035
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,360
I love it now.

1036
01:11:49,402 --> 01:11:51,070
I can krump, too.

1037
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:54,657
I get krump for Christ,
but I get krump.

1038
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:56,774
Is there a difference?

1039
01:11:56,826 --> 01:11:58,786
I don't think
there is a difference.

1040
01:11:58,828 --> 01:12:01,372
I think when they dance,
they dance from their spirit.

1041
01:12:01,414 --> 01:12:06,127
And when I'm... when I'm at
church, I dance from my spirit.

1042
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,010
If you go
to a Christian church...

1043
01:12:14,051 --> 01:12:18,014
you go to a Pentecostal,
a Methodist, a Baptist church...

1044
01:12:18,055 --> 01:12:20,016
these same movements
can be found in church.

1045
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:21,632
Dragon brought me
back to Christ.

1046
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:24,854
One day, we were getting
krump in my garage...

1047
01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:26,856
and he told me,
"You'd be a lot better...

1048
01:12:26,898 --> 01:12:28,691
"if you start going
back to church."

1049
01:12:28,733 --> 01:12:30,474
And I was, like, "Please."

1050
01:12:30,526 --> 01:12:33,863
I forgot what
started me on my way...

1051
01:12:33,905 --> 01:12:37,700
and it was God,
and it was God telling me...

1052
01:12:37,742 --> 01:12:40,119
"My child, this is your gift.
Use it."

1053
01:12:40,161 --> 01:12:43,247
We're not gonna be clones of
the commercial hip-hop world...

1054
01:12:43,289 --> 01:12:46,584
because that's been seen
for so many years.

1055
01:12:46,626 --> 01:12:49,837
Somebody's waitin'
on something different...

1056
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:53,841
another generation of kids
with morals and values...

1057
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:55,166
that they won't need...

1058
01:12:55,218 --> 01:12:59,597
what's being commercialized
or tailor-made for them...

1059
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:03,226
custom-made, because I feel
that we're custom-made.

1060
01:13:03,267 --> 01:13:07,855
And we're of more value
than any piece of jewelry...

1061
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:12,443
or any car or any big house
that anybody could buy.

1062
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:10,634
I lost my house, got evicted...

1063
01:15:10,686 --> 01:15:13,689
and I had to move in
to an apartment.

1064
01:15:13,731 --> 01:15:15,650
And where I'm at today, movin'.

1065
01:15:15,691 --> 01:15:18,319
If I end up with nothin',
I mean, it hurts...

1066
01:15:18,361 --> 01:15:22,365
but it's like... I mean, dang.
It's like start over again.

1067
01:15:22,406 --> 01:15:26,410
There's a lot of things I wish
I could change if I could...

1068
01:15:26,452 --> 01:15:27,662
if I could start back over.

1069
01:15:27,703 --> 01:15:31,290
And after taking a major loss
like losing your house...

1070
01:15:31,332 --> 01:15:34,919
Iosing all your money, you got
to start over, and, uh...

1071
01:15:34,961 --> 01:15:38,214
yeah, survivin'
in South Central...

1072
01:15:38,256 --> 01:15:41,634
where they say
bustin' a cap is fundamental.

1073
01:15:41,676 --> 01:15:44,178
When they get to hatin',
start shakin'.

1074
01:15:45,638 --> 01:15:48,516
All right. Let's get ready
to rock 'n' roll, baby.

1075
01:15:48,558 --> 01:15:49,600
This is it... showtime.

1076
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,696
I think I was
the first Caucasian...

1077
01:18:48,738 --> 01:18:50,656
to be dancin' like this.

1078
01:18:50,698 --> 01:18:53,242
And when I first seen it,
I just loved it.

1079
01:18:53,284 --> 01:18:54,744
I mean, I wanted to do it.

1080
01:18:54,786 --> 01:18:56,788
It was hard for me to do it,
'cause they was...

1081
01:18:56,829 --> 01:18:58,748
"This white boy,
he ain't got no rhythm...

1082
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:00,750
"he ain't doing this,
he ain't gonna do it right."

1083
01:19:00,792 --> 01:19:02,752
When I was jumpin' out the car,
they just surprised.

1084
01:19:02,794 --> 01:19:04,337
They mouths dropped like...

1085
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:07,465
"Oh, my God, they got a white
boy. What is he gonna do?

1086
01:19:07,507 --> 01:19:09,091
"How is he gonna
go about dancin'?"

1087
01:19:09,133 --> 01:19:13,846
Yeah, we get respect,
the way we dance out there...

1088
01:19:13,888 --> 01:19:18,601
'cause they don't think Asians
dance like black people.

1089
01:19:25,525 --> 01:19:27,568
You got a certain talent...

1090
01:19:27,610 --> 01:19:31,072
don't be... don't be
afraid to express it.

1091
01:19:39,914 --> 01:19:42,458
We have the belief
that we can be somebody...

1092
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,418
and that we're
gonna be somebody.

1093
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,213
We're gonna... we're gonna rise,
no matter what.

1094
01:19:53,302 --> 01:19:56,556
The sky is the limit,
and there is no limit.
