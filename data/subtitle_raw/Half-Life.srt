1
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:13,656
If I pay close attention...

2
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:17,686
I can feel outer space
pulling at us.

3
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:28,337
One way to fight
the pull of the vacuum...

4
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,824
is to create your own.

5
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:07,752
The chaos deepens
in coastal areas worldwide.

6
00:02:07,753 --> 00:02:12,215
Flooding along coastal Florida,
California, China, Taiwan,

7
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:16,052
Japan and Southeast Asia
has submerged entire cities.

8
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,748
Displaced refugees numbers
in the tens of thousands.

9
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,769
Activists crowded the streets
near UN headquarters today

10
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,022
as major industrialized nations
meet for the fourth time

11
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,149
to discuss
global warming initiatives.

12
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,401
Again, one of the few
countries not participating

13
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,903
is the United States,

14
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,988
consistent with the current
administration's refusal

15
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,782
to ratify the Kyoto protocol.

16
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,159
This is the
Diablo Valley Authority

17
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,869
with bulletins for your area.

18
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,622
We're issuing an air quality
alert for Thursday and Friday,

19
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,749
so remember to wear
protective masks

20
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,084
when exercising outside.

21
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,294
If you need a new one
go to your nearest gas station,

22
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,088
police station, or library.

23
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,131
Replacement masks
are six dollars.

24
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,801
The worst isn't over yet so
remember to keep conserving gas

25
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:59,178
and potable water to help out
our friends on the coast.

26
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,722
Conserve hard,
stay safe, neighbors,

27
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,057
and don't forget to watch

28
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,669
for the solar eclipse
today at 1:45...

29
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,921
Emergencies only.

30
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,138
Buy yourself
a pizza pocket, OK?

31
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:48,477
He will wipe away
every tear from their eyes.

32
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,480
And death will be no more,

33
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,983
nor will there be
sorrow or crying

34
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,110
or pain anymore,

35
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,180
for the former things
have passed away.

36
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:08,080
There are armed conflicts
in the Balkans, Iraq, Korea,

37
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:14,045
Russia, Mexico, Colombia,
Israel, and Peru.

38
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,755
Can anyone
tell me one thing

39
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,715
that happened
in the world today?

40
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,133
Jenny?

41
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:22,037
The mayor was
caught drunk driving.

42
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,016
I had a fight with my mom.
I tripped her.

43
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,712
All right, settle.

44
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,857
Sources from Chinese Central
Space say female astronaut,

45
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,567
Xian Wei Ming,
stationed on the

46
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,653
recently launched
Chinese space telescope,

47
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:41,614
has been reporting sights
of asymmetrical swelling

48
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,991
and solar flaring
from her sun observations.

49
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,661
Several hours after
Central Space authorities

50
00:04:46,662 --> 00:04:49,330
refused to confirm
Xian's observations,

51
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,667
Xian reportedly changed
trajectory of her spacecraft

52
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,669
to a direct path
to meet with the sun

53
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,740
and expended all remaining
fuels to break earth's orbit.

54
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,077
Earlier today,
a 12 year-old Palestinian girl

55
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:31,731
was run down by an
Israeli tank at Hebron...

56
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:34,310
Yes.

57
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,895
There was an eclipse.

58
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,565
I know sweetie,
but it's not an emergency.

59
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,609
You didn't look at it, did you?

60
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,819
- No.
- 'Cuz you'll go blind.

61
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,722
Bye.

62
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,856
Your Mom lets you
walk home alone?

63
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,961
Hi, Wendell.

64
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,697
You want a ride back?

65
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:07,820
Off work already?

66
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,889
Yeah, they let me
go home early.

67
00:08:15,454 --> 00:08:16,996
So, umm...

68
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,482
How are things
between you and Scott?

69
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,368
Dude, quiet down.

70
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,471
Oh, come on.
He's a good kid.

71
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:34,915
Aren't you, Tim?

72
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,167
Yup.

73
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,210
Hey!

74
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,093
You're home early.
Yeah.

75
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,014
I need a nap.

76
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,359
You're going out?

77
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,886
What do you
want to be one day?

78
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,350
I don't know...

79
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,578
Sorry you're just
dating a dumb jock

80
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,607
who only wants to go
whitewater rafting.

81
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,169
He's been practicing baptisms
with his dad all day.

82
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:34,944
Scott!

83
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:37,097
Pam's here.

84
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,266
Do you want some lunch?

85
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,855
What took you so long?

86
00:12:09,146 --> 00:12:10,813
You need to quit smoking.

87
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:13,357
You need a
double-headed dragon dildo.

88
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,526
I did quit.

89
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,346
I can smell it
on your clothes.

90
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:21,141
I quit two hours ago.

91
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,870
Diablo Valley Animal Control
has issued a warning

92
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,524
for all residents
to keep their pets inside.

93
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:36,506
And in Fresno today,
Centron employee, Roderick Kent,

94
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:40,218
shot and dismembered
his wife and two children,

95
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,912
then severed his own
head with a chainsaw.

96
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:49,393
Kent had just been maimed...

97
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,062
Sorry - just been named

98
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,523
Centron Employee of the Month
for his efforts...

99
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:56,776
Folks are saying
these incidents are omens.

100
00:12:56,777 --> 00:13:00,847
Any little thing and it's a sign
the world's gonna end.

101
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,851
Totally paranoid, huh?

102
00:13:05,953 --> 00:13:08,621
We've been killing
each other off since day one.

103
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:12,333
We don't stop
because we don't want to.

104
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:14,418
Everyone keeps working,

105
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:18,365
going to the gym,
going to ball games.

106
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:22,202
How could the world end?

107
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,973
Some people think the sun
will swell up into a red giant

108
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,834
and burn up all the planets.

109
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,980
And some people expect
a sort of Antichrist,

110
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,732
who comes along
pretending to be all nice,

111
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,261
and making everyone
believe in him.

112
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:44,240
Then he tries to corrupt people
so they won't get into heaven.

113
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:48,619
But eventually he's overthrown
by God in a rain of comets

114
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,399
and good triumphs
over evil, et cetera, et cetera.

115
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,818
Silly.

116
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,447
Ow.

117
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,812
You just imagine it's not there,
as if it never happened.

118
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,856
Like turning back time.

119
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:21,177
Look at it...
and say hello.

120
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,279
Hello.

121
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,655
OK.

122
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:29,827
Now close your eyes,
concentrate...

123
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,813
and say goodbye.

124
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,149
Bye.

125
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,321
Own it.

126
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,491
Bye.

127
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,304
Yeah, well.

128
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,665
Never worked for me either.

129
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:54,294
Drink your juice, OK?

130
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,094
Bye.

131
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:23,714
So what's new, college boy?

132
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,290
I had sex for the first time.

133
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,711
With that Jonah guy?

134
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:41,591
No...
Me and my goldfish.

135
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,469
Of course,
me and that Jonah guy.

136
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,974
That's really great.

137
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,644
That's really cool.

138
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,580
We had sex sex.

139
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:57,649
Mm hmm...

140
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:00,084
Anal sex.

141
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,586
- Yeah, I know.
- OK.

142
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,129
I figured.

143
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,881
I didn't know if you knew.

144
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,909
I don't know what else
you guys would be having.

145
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,454
So how was it?

146
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:17,752
Incredible.

147
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:20,521
I don't know.

148
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,591
I may really
be in love this time.

149
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,432
It didn't hurt?

150
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,768
No.

151
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,912
Well...

152
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,456
Yeah, it did initially,

153
00:16:38,457 --> 00:16:42,319
but then that kind of fed
into the pleasure/pain thing.

154
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,071
You just have
to use a lot of lube.

155
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:51,328
Dinner time.

156
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:59,836
Let's not leave.

157
00:17:02,356 --> 00:17:04,382
I have to.

158
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:10,847
Anyway, you really should
try it some time - anal sex.

159
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,353
Call me!

160
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:53,906
We are very,
very blessed, dear Lord,

161
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:58,161
to have this wonderful,
wonderful family.

162
00:17:58,162 --> 00:17:59,996
So for that we thank you,

163
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:02,331
and for the food
you placed in front of us,

164
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,959
prepared by my lovely wife,

165
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,921
which we eat
in your name, O Lord.

166
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,741
- Amen.
- Amen.

167
00:18:23,312 --> 00:18:25,714
I like to have sex with men.

168
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,806
Did you hear what I said?

169
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:43,273
Should anyone be blamed
for becoming bored?

170
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:50,822
Yeah.

171
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:54,868
He's black.

172
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:58,554
We really should make
more black friends.

173
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,764
And his name is Jonah.

174
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:03,126
Maybe another outreach meeting.

175
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:08,648
It is so hard to get blacks
to come into our church.

176
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:11,676
It isn't hard to find one
to come inside me.

177
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:16,072
Boredom leads to restlessness,

178
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:18,783
restlessness to recklessness.

179
00:19:18,784 --> 00:19:25,523
And recklessness
puts all of us in harm's way.

180
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,001
I read in U.S. News
and World Report

181
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:35,867
that the anus is chockfull
with ecoli bacteria.

182
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,873
We used a condom.

183
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:51,675
Condoms provide excellent
protection against diseases.

184
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,846
We should put one
over our house.

185
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,620
Richard, didn't you
mention a Jonah

186
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,524
in your sermon last month?

187
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:14,297
He was swallowed
by a whale.

188
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,199
A very large fish.

189
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:49,608
You should
try it sometime - anal sex.

190
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,133
Heart.

191
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:01,928
My heart is broken.

192
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,080
Heart.

193
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:10,144
Scissors.

194
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:13,189
Put down the scissors.

195
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,383
Scissors.

196
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:20,154
Genocide.

197
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:24,017
Avoid genocide.

198
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:28,271
Did you study for this?

199
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:31,040
No.

200
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,708
Why not?

201
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:34,861
I don't know.

202
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,056
I'm going to call your mom, OK?

203
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,418
She's not home
until 7 o'clock sometimes.

204
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,796
What about your dad?

205
00:21:55,107 --> 00:21:57,676
He's not with us anymore.

206
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,595
When did he pass away?

207
00:22:02,614 --> 00:22:05,241
He just said bye.

208
00:22:05,242 --> 00:22:07,519
He's not really dead.

209
00:22:16,587 --> 00:22:19,422
It's only three weeks
after I turn 18

210
00:22:19,423 --> 00:22:24,427
that Timothy Wu files
his last official flight plan

211
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:27,263
and takes off west
into the sun.

212
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:31,058
For a year
we wondered where he went.

213
00:22:31,059 --> 00:22:34,270
Now we don't care
what happens to him.

214
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,315
Last night a 67-year-old
fisherman dumped 40 tons

215
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:40,026
of toxic waste
into Catalina Bay.

216
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:43,112
Arresting officers mention
he was speaking incoherently

217
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:45,531
about killing off the jellyfish
that in recent years

218
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:49,160
have choked what was once
a vibrant fishing industry.

219
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:51,537
This one of a string
of desperate acts we've seen

220
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,457
in depressed fishing communities
which have dwindled

221
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:56,334
as the population
of jellyfish has exploded

222
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:59,321
as a result of rising
sea temperatures.

223
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,073
Exhale, inhale.

224
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,299
One more time for me.

225
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,869
Inhale, exhale.

226
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:35,039
Oh, shit!

227
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,999
Officer, haven't you
ever been distracted?

228
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,818
No, ma'am.

229
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:41,071
Bullshit!

230
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:44,048
I just think Timothy
needs a more stable

231
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:47,009
home environment to foster
his growth potential.

232
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,054
Why don't you just bring some
fucking dinner over then?

233
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:50,930
Well...

234
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,683
Kids need food
to grow too, Mr. Robertson.

235
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:55,418
I'm just trying...

236
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:08,890
I really need some alone time
or I will literally die.

237
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:19,818
Don't talk to your teachers
about our personal life, OK?

238
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,575
Take Timmy with you
to work tonight.

239
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,551
Take him to work?

240
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:32,914
It's just one night...
Please.

241
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,417
I can watch him.

242
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:38,420
I need you to watch me.

243
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,825
But who cares
about what I need.

244
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:55,119
Mom, it's not that
I don't care.

245
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,787
It's just that if
I take Tim to work

246
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:59,415
they're gonna be pissed
off if I show up with...

247
00:24:59,416 --> 00:25:02,277
How long does it take
to mop a hangar?

248
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,464
It's not like you're
going to school

249
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:08,909
to do something
with your life...

250
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:13,930
Nobody wants what's good
for them at the right time.

251
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:17,642
You miss your moment,
and you find yourself...

252
00:25:17,643 --> 00:25:20,144
stuck with...

253
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:23,506
Fine, I'll take him.

254
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:29,971
If we stress you out so bad
why'd you even have us?

255
00:25:32,032 --> 00:25:35,393
Well, Pam...
Your father... -

256
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:50,033
Well, don't just stare at it!

257
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,997
Relax.

258
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,749
Mom!

259
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,648
Sorry...

260
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:07,342
Just clean it up.

261
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:26,963
That's really loud.
Please stop.

262
00:27:27,606 --> 00:27:29,466
Why?

263
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:33,470
Because... It's loud.

264
00:27:42,037 --> 00:27:44,189
Tim!

265
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,327
Don't make me
come up there.

266
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,957
What did you say?

267
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,976
Dad said it...

268
00:28:04,977 --> 00:28:08,129
"Don't make me
come up there".

269
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,929
Do you miss him?

270
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:27,649
Should I tell you
it wasn't your fault?

271
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,363
'Cuz it wasn't.

272
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,162
I didn't know
you washed airplanes.

273
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:45,792
Well... they get dirty.

274
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,839
Whose fault is it?

275
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,848
Do you believe in heaven?

276
00:29:03,744 --> 00:29:05,896
Yes.

277
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,192
Dad did too.

278
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:18,841
I don't know...

279
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:21,870
I guess he was
just ready for something new.

280
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:33,048
Do you like Wendell?

281
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:37,010
He's funny.

282
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,430
Funny like a clown?

283
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,559
Funny like the President.

284
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:51,608
I like that one.

285
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,784
Only for a second, OK?

286
00:30:00,884 --> 00:30:02,677
Romeo Delta...

287
00:30:02,678 --> 00:30:04,720
Timmy, Oakland center.

288
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:06,581
Go ahead.

289
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:12,895
Pammy, 628 Romeo Delta...

290
00:30:12,896 --> 00:30:15,731
Experiencing heavy turbulence,

291
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:19,052
requesting niner point five.

292
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:21,737
Sorry...

293
00:30:21,738 --> 00:30:25,767
Remain in current altitude
due to traffic.

294
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,061
Dammit!

295
00:30:28,412 --> 00:30:30,772
Oh, no, a bird!

296
00:30:32,583 --> 00:30:39,489
Aaaaaahhhhhh!

297
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:46,637
What I'm saying
is that while, yes,

298
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:48,973
you did draw very
nice cotton fields,

299
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:51,851
you also could diversify
your subject matter?

300
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,713
Like maybe draw a boat.

301
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:58,466
Or an Underground Railroad?

302
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:01,136
Or just a railroad.

303
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,068
That's pretty.

304
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,654
Good.

305
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,510
What's that supposed
to be anyway?

306
00:31:25,511 --> 00:31:27,136
A waterfall.

307
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:29,597
Looks like a cool
alternate reality.

308
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:30,973
You know what I mean?

309
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,585
OK.

310
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:42,485
Sorry to mess things up
at home for you.

311
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:44,471
It's all good.

312
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:51,937
Do you want
to come over on Saturday?

313
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:56,900
We're having a barbecue.

314
00:31:58,919 --> 00:31:59,877
Cool.

315
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:01,128
Are you sure your mom...

316
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:03,448
She said to invite two guests.

317
00:32:26,697 --> 00:32:28,489
Oh, we gotta get this.

318
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:31,434
Yeah, we need salsa too.

319
00:32:32,953 --> 00:32:35,079
Mild or hot?

320
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,731
Hot.

321
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,235
Speaking of hot,
you look good today.

322
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,700
What?

323
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,384
Come on.

324
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,553
Are you seriously one of
those people who can't accept

325
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:54,291
a compliment without accusing
someone of sexual harassment?

326
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,714
No.

327
00:33:01,356 --> 00:33:04,426
I just don't like being
compared to a condiment.

328
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,597
Oh...

329
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,725
Well.

330
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:08,114
Where did you find that?

331
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,267
That's a project
your daddy and I started

332
00:34:19,268 --> 00:34:21,836
when Pam was really young.

333
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:28,635
We were all addicted to sunsets.

334
00:34:31,822 --> 00:34:34,641
We even took some
from your dad's plane.

335
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,229
I thought he took this with him.

336
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,091
Your mom really
cares about you, you know?

337
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,194
She never once
regretted having you

338
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:13,638
instead of finishing
med school.

339
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:18,268
You ever thought about
tracking down your dad?

340
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,317
You have us all figured out.

341
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,655
No, I don't.

342
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:35,243
But I do want to help.

343
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:47,355
It's blank.

344
00:35:47,356 --> 00:35:50,316
Timothy and I were talking...

345
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,928
I got the impression
you needed flying lessons.

346
00:35:55,072 --> 00:35:59,309
Flying's for
prick-waxing jerk-offs.

347
00:36:01,537 --> 00:36:03,730
No need to be redundant.

348
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:13,782
Stop!

349
00:36:19,763 --> 00:36:22,014
Shit...

350
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,266
Sorry.

351
00:36:23,267 --> 00:36:25,669
No stars to guide us.

352
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:36,445
Another marine creature,

353
00:36:36,446 --> 00:36:38,614
armed with a mass
of stinging cells,

354
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:42,936
can be found sailing the warm
oceans of the world...

355
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:52,404
Zay... jee.

356
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:55,323
Zayyyy... jee.

357
00:36:55,507 --> 00:36:57,325
Zai-Jian.

358
00:36:57,676 --> 00:36:59,828
Zai-Jian - Later, alligator...

359
00:37:02,306 --> 00:37:04,708
Your dad could've
taught you more...

360
00:37:06,268 --> 00:37:08,728
If he wasn't such a space case.

361
00:37:08,729 --> 00:37:11,147
The bluebottle jelly,
or Portuguese Man O' War,

362
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:15,151
is actually a symbiotic colony
of four specialized animals.

363
00:37:15,152 --> 00:37:17,945
One polyp fills up
with gas to become afloat,

364
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,655
enabling the bluebottles
to stay close

365
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,533
to the surface for feeding.

366
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:25,453
During the capture the chamber
will shift in buoyancy

367
00:37:25,454 --> 00:37:28,565
to accommodate the weight
of large prey...

368
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:22,244
~#XX

369
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:34,923
I'm a whale!

370
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,195
My project explores
the relentless relationship

371
00:38:41,196 --> 00:38:43,573
between the body and the self.

372
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,575
What do our bodies ask of us?

373
00:38:45,576 --> 00:38:48,812
Who are we without our bodies?

374
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:52,165
Are these shells here
to keep us separate

375
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:54,776
from one another eternally?

376
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:58,129
So, yeah, my installments
explore these ideas

377
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:03,827
by consolidating flint,
barbed wire and live turkeys.

378
00:39:05,596 --> 00:39:08,764
Oh, that's really
quite typical... topical.

379
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:10,667
Isn't it?

380
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,253
Totally.

381
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,797
That's amazing.

382
00:39:16,273 --> 00:39:18,300
Off to the loo.

383
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,344
Down the hall.

384
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:34,957
So, Jonah, I had no idea

385
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,293
you were Timothy's
teacher and Scott's...

386
00:39:37,294 --> 00:39:39,446
Small world, huh?

387
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:45,619
Can I get you anything?

388
00:39:47,012 --> 00:39:50,165
Ro - Sham - Bo!

389
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,880
Ro - Sham - Bo!

390
00:40:02,402 --> 00:40:03,486
That's stupid.

391
00:40:03,487 --> 00:40:04,862
Bombs are for psychos.

392
00:40:04,863 --> 00:40:06,697
- Shut up!
- No!

393
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,032
Pacifier.

394
00:40:08,033 --> 00:40:09,242
You mean pacifist.

395
00:40:09,243 --> 00:40:11,144
Pacifist.

396
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:16,249
Why must people focus on
the darkness in the world...

397
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,501
when all most people
want to do is

398
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:20,461
achieve some kind of...

399
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:22,822
some kind of peace?

400
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,176
So...

401
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:30,179
Wendell is, um...

402
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,097
Thank you.

403
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,541
Yes, he's quite a catch!

404
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,686
He's a little...

405
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,355
Well, is he a student?

406
00:40:39,356 --> 00:40:40,314
No.

407
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:43,843
He's an assistant manager
at Sports Lodge.

408
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:46,763
Great!

409
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,392
Isn't it amazing when people
see your inner beauty?

410
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,229
It floors me every time!

411
00:40:55,873 --> 00:40:58,624
Swarms of Cessnas every day,

412
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,152
since they grounded
all the big planes.

413
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:05,615
So how long have you
and Saura been going at it?

414
00:41:06,425 --> 00:41:08,885
Let me say that
a little differently...

415
00:41:08,886 --> 00:41:10,469
About five weeks.

416
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,722
Hmm... not too long!

417
00:41:17,561 --> 00:41:19,729
So, is Timothy doing OK?

418
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,607
He's sophisticated
for his age group.

419
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:25,969
He just doesn't seem
to study at home a lot.

420
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,405
Yeah, well...

421
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:32,058
Mom's real busy, you know.

422
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,687
Oh, I know.

423
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:48,799
Skippy put up
a good fight though,

424
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,552
more than most collies would.

425
00:41:51,553 --> 00:41:53,763
In the end it's really just
your own self-interest

426
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:56,791
that's keeping them alive.

427
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:59,727
I'm just saying college
is actually a great way

428
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,896
to make new connections.

429
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:05,483
I truly think connectivity
is the only surefire way

430
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:09,779
to a decent career -
or lifestyle, for that matter.

431
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,448
I mean, a solid
network of connectivity...

432
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,826
Well, what's the point?

433
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:18,287
I mean everything
is hell anyway, right?

434
00:42:18,288 --> 00:42:21,749
It's easy for you to say that.

435
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:24,585
I mean in your life,
you have so much freedom -

436
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:26,671
the way you live.

437
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:29,131
Millions of kids would die

438
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,884
for the opportunity
that you have.

439
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:33,302
I just think that you're
taking it for granted

440
00:42:33,303 --> 00:42:35,596
because it is
within your grasp.

441
00:42:35,597 --> 00:42:38,140
I mean just sitting
here talking to you,

442
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:40,476
you seem like
a pretty smart girl.

443
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:44,480
Well, millions of kids are dying
for our opportunities.

444
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:47,467
I just don't think
everything is hell.

445
00:42:49,319 --> 00:42:51,805
Jell-o, anyone?

446
00:42:52,072 --> 00:42:53,698
Do you want Jell-o?

447
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,809
I don't eat Jell-o.

448
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:02,440
You dropped your chair.

449
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,917
Pam is so pretty.

450
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,670
She's so wonderfully exotic.

451
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:09,755
She's so lucky.

452
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:12,158
I wonder if she realizes it.

453
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:17,163
We certainly don't want her
flying off any more roofs.

454
00:43:20,142 --> 00:43:22,768
She's much better now.

455
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,354
You told me
about the 3.8 GPA.

456
00:43:25,355 --> 00:43:27,549
That's great.

457
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:31,469
Pity college is so expensive.

458
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,532
Yeah, pity about
your dog dying too.

459
00:43:36,533 --> 00:43:40,395
That must have
been really ruffff.

460
00:44:02,935 --> 00:44:05,378
Do you know
where the tofu dogs are?

461
00:44:05,604 --> 00:44:07,464
Try the freezer.

462
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,926
You seem agitated.

463
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:14,429
I'm wonderfully exotic.

464
00:44:19,034 --> 00:44:21,102
Anything I can do?

465
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:36,618
It's OK.

466
00:44:37,761 --> 00:44:39,579
It's all right.

467
00:44:55,571 --> 00:44:58,098
I just wanna disappear.

468
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,106
You make me
want to disappear.

469
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,025
You're wasting our power.

470
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,367
For months
after Dad flew off

471
00:47:06,368 --> 00:47:09,729
Mom had this
recurring nightmare...

472
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:15,126
Again and again
she'd wake us up

473
00:47:15,127 --> 00:47:19,422
right before sunrise,
saying that the sun

474
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:22,133
had reached its half-life
and had turned into

475
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:25,495
a jellyfish that was
devouring the ocean.

476
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:33,019
Every creature in the sea
knew they were doomed

477
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,938
if they stayed in the water,

478
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:39,926
but outside of it
they'd suffocate.

479
00:47:40,777 --> 00:47:46,282
Made so sick and sightless
by their own terror...

480
00:47:46,283 --> 00:47:49,603
many destroyed
themselves in anguish.

481
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:03,925
But even in their most
futile of moments

482
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:08,387
they seemed to sense
something in us worth saving,

483
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:11,307
and they wouldn't
take us with them...

484
00:48:11,308 --> 00:48:14,669
even when we asked them to.

485
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:44,924
Even when their stories
scared us half to death...

486
00:48:44,925 --> 00:48:47,577
they were beautiful to me.

487
00:48:54,101 --> 00:48:59,021
When she met Wendell...

488
00:48:59,022 --> 00:49:02,358
her stories stopped.

489
00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:04,886
She didn't have
to dream anymore.

490
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:09,198
400 thousand activists
and area residents

491
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,410
gathered in Slovenia today
to celebrate the demolition

492
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:14,328
of the last existing
nuclear power plant

493
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:17,456
on the European continent.

494
00:49:17,457 --> 00:49:20,001
Demands for environmental action
from ordinary American citizens

495
00:49:20,002 --> 00:49:23,671
continues to grow, however,
as politicians and celebrities

496
00:49:23,672 --> 00:49:24,839
continue to sound the call...

497
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,158
Don't watch this.

498
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,414
Don't look.

499
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,461
Scott and Mr. Robertson
were holding hands.

500
00:49:39,229 --> 00:49:41,439
Well, that's fine,

501
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,176
but they're gonna
go through some hard times.

502
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:48,263
How come?

503
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:52,909
Because...

504
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:58,106
they like hanging with boys
more than they like girls.

505
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:03,737
I like boys more than girls.

506
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:07,824
That's different, sweetness.

507
00:51:11,697 --> 00:51:13,906
What do you think about
on your good days?

508
00:51:13,907 --> 00:51:16,142
You know, your daydreams?

509
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,484
I just want peace, you know.

510
00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:35,636
There are things
I haven't told you about...

511
00:51:35,637 --> 00:51:37,706
that I'll tell you some time.

512
00:51:54,072 --> 00:51:55,849
I really fucked up.

513
00:51:59,828 --> 00:52:01,245
What?

514
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,440
I kissed him.

515
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:07,819
You serious?

516
00:52:10,672 --> 00:52:12,574
Yup.

517
00:52:15,511 --> 00:52:16,469
Why?

518
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:18,371
'Cuz I'm a fuck-up.

519
00:52:33,904 --> 00:52:35,988
I guess I should go...

520
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,600
I'm fucking sad right now.

521
00:52:39,952 --> 00:52:41,770
So?

522
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:43,855
I'm depressed.

523
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:49,710
You're the only clear...

524
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:53,531
exciting thing
in my life, basically.

525
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:58,787
I just feel like
everyone else is corrupt.

526
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:24,813
I hope it's not
anyone we know.

527
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:15,171
You can't fight me!
I'm Jesus!

528
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:18,783
Yeah, well, I'm God!
I'm your Dad!

529
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:35,675
You look depressed.

530
00:54:39,196 --> 00:54:41,348
Did I do something wrong?

531
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:44,226
No.

532
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:47,062
Good.

533
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:56,821
What?

534
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:10,961
Does he make you
feel special?

535
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,174
He stands up for you
when I complain.

536
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,472
You complain about me too?

537
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:27,852
Mom!

538
00:55:32,374 --> 00:55:35,360
I'm happy, OK?

539
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:41,716
OK...

540
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:43,910
Then I'm happy too.

541
00:55:55,230 --> 00:55:56,673
Yeah?

542
00:56:57,459 --> 00:57:00,528
Sorry all about the weird
stuff at the barbecue.

543
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:10,847
Sometimes adults
just do weird things...

544
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:12,749
Things that we don't mean.

545
00:57:15,394 --> 00:57:17,337
We're very immature.

546
00:57:19,148 --> 00:57:21,508
You're not an adult.

547
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,085
It's one month before he
realizes he's bored of us

548
00:57:41,086 --> 00:57:44,881
when Dad insists
on reading me to bed...

549
00:57:44,882 --> 00:57:47,909
which he hasn't done
since I was 6.

550
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:55,016
'We can start working with time
if you wish,' Chiang said,

551
00:57:55,017 --> 00:57:58,352
'Till you can fly into
the past and the future.

552
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:01,631
And then you will be ready'.

553
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:06,319
The day that Chiang vanished

554
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:09,447
his feathers went
brighter and brighter

555
00:58:09,448 --> 00:58:12,074
and at last turned so brilliant

556
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:15,186
that no gull
could look upon him.

557
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,682
As the days went past,

558
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:39,393
Jonathan found himself
thinking time and again

559
00:58:39,394 --> 00:58:42,730
of the earth
from which he had come.

560
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:45,858
If he had known there -

561
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:49,529
just a tenth...

562
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,073
just a hundredth -

563
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:54,367
of what he knew here,

564
00:58:54,368 --> 00:58:58,104
how much more
life would have meant.

565
00:59:17,975 --> 00:59:19,960
It's nice.

566
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,984
When did you say that your
parents are coming home?

567
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:28,943
Monday.

568
00:59:28,944 --> 00:59:32,222
They went on a retreat,
some church retreat.

569
00:59:59,349 --> 01:00:01,042
Excuse me...

570
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:03,019
We're home.

571
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,005
- Oh, my gosh!
- Hi, Mom.

572
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:13,305
When you're done
I'd like a word.

573
01:00:28,962 --> 01:00:32,048
Your parents called
the schoolboard, Scott.

574
01:00:32,049 --> 01:00:34,826
There's been
a lot of complaints.

575
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,545
They're recommending
a transfer.

576
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:50,107
It's no one's fault, :
It's just the situation.

577
01:00:50,108 --> 01:00:52,485
OK, everyone,
I'm Miss Gatzert.

578
01:00:52,486 --> 01:00:54,862
Mr. Robertson came down with
the flu that's going around,

579
01:00:54,863 --> 01:00:56,906
and he left
a spelling list for Friday.

580
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:59,700
I'd like you all to take out
your World History books.

581
01:00:59,701 --> 01:01:02,520
Have we covered
The Crusades yet?

582
01:01:25,435 --> 01:01:27,228
What are you looking at?

583
01:01:27,229 --> 01:01:30,131
Are you a homo
like Mr. Robertson?

584
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,910
It's kind of hard
to put into words

585
01:03:05,911 --> 01:03:08,772
what makes you
fall in love with someone.

586
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:11,691
It's indescribable.

587
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,780
Here you go, Scout.

588
01:03:21,844 --> 01:03:23,620
There has to be an event.

589
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:31,853
It's an event that marks
a change in you...

590
01:03:31,854 --> 01:03:34,422
Like a nova.

591
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:38,693
A nova is when
a star becomes unstable.

592
01:03:38,694 --> 01:03:42,097
So it's like inside you've
become a hundred times bigger.

593
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:48,687
And no one can see it,
but everyone knows.

594
01:03:59,298 --> 01:04:01,074
How's your sister?

595
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:05,745
Fine.

596
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:27,809
Have you seen
her and Scott kiss?

597
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:35,692
No?

598
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:39,029
Have you seen
her taking a bath?

599
01:04:47,763 --> 01:04:50,165
I think she
must be beautiful.

600
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:06,614
Explode...

601
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:11,661
X~P~L~O~D~E.

602
01:05:11,662 --> 01:05:12,703
Explode.

603
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:14,330
Silver...

604
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:21,087
S~L~I~V~E~R...

605
01:05:21,088 --> 01:05:22,822
Silver.

606
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,287
Four Palestinians
and one Israeli soldier

607
01:05:54,288 --> 01:05:57,331
were killed Thursday
in the West Bank in Gaza.

608
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:58,916
A 12-year old Palestinian girl

609
01:05:58,917 --> 01:06:01,987
was crushed by
a tank at Hebron...

610
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:42,944
I feel sick.

611
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:47,407
Was it me?

612
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:50,368
No.

613
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:58,418
Did Wendell say something?

614
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:02,631
Not really.

615
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:09,429
Are you lying?

616
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,602
He was just talking weird.

617
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:20,148
Weird like how?

618
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:25,753
Like when you're eating
and you're crying,

619
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:28,281
and it doesn't taste good.

620
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:35,429
I know...

621
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:37,832
I hate that.

622
01:07:50,821 --> 01:07:53,239
So, Jonah called.

623
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:56,351
It looks like the school board
sided with you guys.

624
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:03,692
I think it's time
that we reassess things.

625
01:08:05,043 --> 01:08:07,028
Reassess what?

626
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:09,781
My rectum?

627
01:08:13,093 --> 01:08:15,803
You know,
when I was very young

628
01:08:15,804 --> 01:08:21,100
I thought I could find meaning
by using my time on this earth

629
01:08:21,101 --> 01:08:24,770
to make up for having
more than others.

630
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:29,567
I failed at everything I tried.

631
01:08:29,568 --> 01:08:33,946
We still rage, kill, starve.

632
01:08:33,947 --> 01:08:40,161
There's only
so much you can do.

633
01:08:40,162 --> 01:08:42,163
At a certain point,

634
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:46,459
the futility begins
to eat into you.

635
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:51,172
At a certain point
you have to abandon control.

636
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:54,425
You have to leave
the rest to God.

637
01:08:54,426 --> 01:08:57,887
I think... you think...

638
01:08:57,888 --> 01:09:02,975
the mere act of thinking...

639
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:05,353
is your God.

640
01:09:05,354 --> 01:09:07,688
I do everything for you
out of love...

641
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:10,133
There is no God.

642
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:23,204
Don't you ever...

643
01:09:23,205 --> 01:09:25,941
Don't you ever
speak to him again.

644
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:32,296
If you don't get the fuck
out of our house...

645
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:34,382
I'll fucking kill you!

646
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,383
Hey...

647
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,327
Stop, stop, stop.

648
01:09:38,178 --> 01:09:40,914
You're sick!

649
01:09:44,226 --> 01:09:46,060
You erase me

650
01:09:46,061 --> 01:09:49,021
and you fill me up
at the same time.

651
01:09:49,022 --> 01:09:51,232
I don't know
what to do about it.

652
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:53,635
I need your help
to figure it out, OK?

653
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:58,723
Shoot, dammit.

654
01:09:59,116 --> 01:10:00,809
I'm almost home, Tim.

655
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:03,703
Hi. It's Saura.

656
01:10:03,704 --> 01:10:05,371
I can't take
your call right now,

657
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,357
so leave a message.

658
01:10:07,457 --> 01:10:08,916
I need you to help me, Pam.

659
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:11,820
I need you to...
be an adult with me.

660
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:17,951
Grow up and help me, Pam.

661
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:28,102
You know how to get everything
you want with your stupid smile.

662
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,629
So do you.

663
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,466
Get off!

664
01:10:41,617 --> 01:10:43,768
Just let go.

665
01:11:00,761 --> 01:11:03,163
You need to talk
to your daughter.

666
01:11:04,264 --> 01:11:08,476
Mom, he's been asking Tim
sick questions about me.

667
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:11,713
I just can't handle it.
I can't!

668
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:21,348
Oh, my God.

669
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:28,647
He raped me.

670
01:11:28,831 --> 01:11:30,690
Are you kidding me?

671
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,907
He raped me.

672
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:42,802
Tim was here the whole time.

673
01:11:42,803 --> 01:11:45,038
He knows.

674
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:49,584
Oh, my God!

675
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:02,556
Did he?

676
01:12:03,740 --> 01:12:05,684
Did he rape her?

677
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,942
No.

678
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:31,293
He doesn't even
understand what you're saying!

679
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:30,493
Where are we going?

680
01:13:30,494 --> 01:13:32,646
Away from this stupid place.

681
01:13:33,789 --> 01:13:35,815
Turn fuckin' green!

682
01:14:54,536 --> 01:14:56,104
It's cold!

683
01:14:57,581 --> 01:14:59,900
Go to the car
and turn the heater on.

684
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,652
Fuck.

685
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:27,735
You see anything?

686
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:29,262
Not yet.

687
01:16:00,227 --> 01:16:01,936
I've been meaning
to give those to you

688
01:16:01,937 --> 01:16:05,882
in support of your
cocksucking relationship.

689
01:16:15,075 --> 01:16:16,810
You're special.

690
01:16:21,999 --> 01:16:27,070
I'm not afraid of the world
ending when we hang out.

691
01:16:35,345 --> 01:16:40,792
Do you think we'll be together,
hanging, when it all happens?

692
01:16:46,023 --> 01:16:49,968
We'll probably be long dead
before it happens.

693
01:16:52,154 --> 01:16:55,573
You never know...

694
01:16:55,574 --> 01:16:59,185
We could go
at any second...

695
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:05,942
Now.

696
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:12,282
Or... now.

697
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:20,916
Or... now.

698
01:17:29,691 --> 01:17:31,718
I think we'll be together.

699
01:17:36,698 --> 01:17:40,576
If it wasn't Jonah...

700
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:42,896
it would be me, right?

701
01:17:51,713 --> 01:17:53,448
I don't want to lie to you.

702
01:17:58,345 --> 01:17:59,887
Lie to me.

703
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:01,873
No.

704
01:18:08,856 --> 01:18:10,715
Yeah.

705
01:18:44,766 --> 01:18:46,501
Just kidding.

706
01:19:22,304 --> 01:19:25,056
You two lived
around here long?

707
01:19:25,057 --> 01:19:26,432
Yes.

708
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:28,142
It's a very
safe place to live,

709
01:19:28,143 --> 01:19:30,353
especially if you have kids.

710
01:19:30,354 --> 01:19:32,714
Everybody is so good
to each other around here.

711
01:19:32,981 --> 01:19:34,799
Looks like we're trapped.

712
01:19:42,699 --> 01:19:44,367
Is this right?

713
01:19:44,368 --> 01:19:46,269
I think so.

714
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:38,171
I think it would be wise...

715
01:20:38,172 --> 01:20:40,198
to stop for the night.

716
01:20:40,924 --> 01:20:43,243
I'll call a truck.

717
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,417
I have nothing witty to say.

718
01:20:52,811 --> 01:20:55,130
Say something nice.

719
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:58,884
This is so stupid.

720
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:09,410
Are you all right, honey?

721
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:11,329
Yes, I'm all right.
Are you hurt?

722
01:21:11,330 --> 01:21:13,481
Oh, I'm fine.

723
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:15,750
I think we should get home.

724
01:21:15,751 --> 01:21:17,418
Help me, Pam.

725
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:19,462
Be an adult with me...

726
01:21:19,463 --> 01:21:22,282
Grow up and help me, Pam.

727
01:21:27,638 --> 01:21:30,290
It's not as bad
as I thought.

728
01:21:32,184 --> 01:21:38,564
This whole experience has just
reminded me of something.

729
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:43,428
Did you remember to
send in our auto premium?

730
01:21:53,539 --> 01:21:56,316
I can't keep my brother
out here like this.

731
01:22:33,537 --> 01:22:36,038
I'm gonna stay
with my parents down south.

732
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:39,401
Maybe apply to grad school.

733
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:43,613
If you leave, they win.

734
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:46,241
What about me?

735
01:22:46,884 --> 01:22:48,869
What about you?

736
01:23:04,359 --> 01:23:06,428
Zai-Jian.

737
01:24:39,872 --> 01:24:41,648
Love you.

738
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:14,639
I figured it out,
you know...

739
01:25:18,243 --> 01:25:21,062
Why mom had Tim so late.

740
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:30,488
She was willing to do
anything to make him stay.

741
01:25:35,677 --> 01:25:37,537
Didn't work.

742
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:50,217
I'm gonna not love you, OK?

743
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:58,266
I'm gonna not be
so stupid anymore.

744
01:25:59,576 --> 01:26:01,702
Be an adult with me.

745
01:26:01,703 --> 01:26:04,564
Grow up and help me, Pam.

746
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:23,015
When you jumped off the roof

747
01:26:23,016 --> 01:26:25,059
you weren't
trying to die, right?

748
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:27,837
'Cuz Mom said
you were trying to die.

749
01:26:29,064 --> 01:26:31,132
Well, I wasn't.

750
01:26:33,777 --> 01:26:36,346
You were trying
to chase Daddy's plane.

751
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:41,810
Open.

752
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,695
So you're telling me that
she faked the whole thing?

753
01:26:54,465 --> 01:26:57,049
Is that what
I'm supposed to think?

754
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:59,035
You know that's
not what I meant.

755
01:27:01,972 --> 01:27:04,457
I'll go get my stuff.

756
01:27:08,228 --> 01:27:09,754
Wait.

757
01:27:11,607 --> 01:27:13,300
What?

758
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:19,347
Let's have a drink.

759
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:21,866
My Mom said to me,

760
01:27:21,867 --> 01:27:25,228
"I think we should
reassess the situation. "

761
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:28,623
I said,
"Reassess what?

762
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:30,567
My rectum?"

763
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:46,166
This is good.

764
01:27:46,934 --> 01:27:50,003
Now they can't just
sweep it under the rug.

765
01:27:52,022 --> 01:27:54,799
It's like it was
meant to be or something.

766
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,094
I don't know.

767
01:27:59,655 --> 01:28:02,098
I feel so close to you now.

768
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:06,645
Did you set this up?

769
01:28:09,790 --> 01:28:11,316
What up?

770
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:16,571
Did you know
your parents would find us?

771
01:28:23,846 --> 01:28:25,997
Yeah.

772
01:28:35,149 --> 01:28:37,175
You know
we're through, right?

773
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:52,331
Scott?

774
01:28:52,332 --> 01:28:54,442
Oh, my God!

775
01:28:54,793 --> 01:28:56,778
He's all right!

776
01:29:00,883 --> 01:29:02,617
Where were you?

777
01:29:42,466 --> 01:29:43,992
Pam.

778
01:29:47,346 --> 01:29:50,389
Weather experts say the showers
should be spectacular.

779
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:53,601
Sky watchers can expect to see
dozens of meteors per hour.

780
01:29:53,602 --> 01:29:55,394
A meteor shower
can sometimes be

781
01:29:55,395 --> 01:29:57,104
the brightest object
in the sky,

782
01:29:57,105 --> 01:29:59,357
wandering through space,
rogue debris left behind

783
01:29:59,358 --> 01:30:01,275
by a timeless comet.

784
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:04,946
The next heavenly display isn't
anticipated until next December.

785
01:30:04,947 --> 01:30:07,682
So don't miss out
on this one, folks.

786
01:31:42,044 --> 01:31:43,570
Tim!

787
01:32:25,379 --> 01:32:26,921
- Eat.
- Hmm?

788
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:28,156
Eat.

789
01:32:33,637 --> 01:32:35,413
Hey...

790
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:37,707
I'm sorry.

791
01:33:04,001 --> 01:33:06,152
Aren't you gonna
drink your juice, buddy?

792
01:33:08,964 --> 01:33:10,657
No.

793
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:21,084
Did your crazy sister
brainwash you?

794
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:07,714
Are you attracted
to stupid people?

795
01:34:08,482 --> 01:34:11,009
Because I'm pretty stupid.

796
01:34:15,531 --> 01:34:16,697
It's all right.

797
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:18,308
No!

798
01:34:18,534 --> 01:34:20,560
Calm down. Please.

799
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:43,766
Get off of her!

800
01:34:43,767 --> 01:34:45,877
Get off!

801
01:34:47,437 --> 01:34:49,422
Mom!

802
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:52,567
What are you...

803
01:34:52,568 --> 01:34:54,010
Mom!

804
01:34:55,404 --> 01:34:57,305
Help me!

805
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:00,449
I'm not going to hurt you.

806
01:35:00,450 --> 01:35:03,244
I'm just gonna hold you here
so you can't hurt me.

807
01:35:03,245 --> 01:35:04,412
OK?

808
01:35:04,413 --> 01:35:05,955
Leave her alone!

809
01:35:05,956 --> 01:35:08,191
Your daughter wants me dead.

810
01:35:20,345 --> 01:35:23,081
You think it's dark in here,
but it's not.

811
01:35:28,061 --> 01:35:29,979
The saddest thing
I've ever seen

812
01:35:29,980 --> 01:35:32,674
is a nice woman
growing old alone.

813
01:35:34,651 --> 01:35:36,678
Pam's not gonna be there.

814
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:39,180
I hate you.

815
01:35:40,991 --> 01:35:43,518
Actually it's kind of pathetic.

816
01:35:55,172 --> 01:35:57,324
Shoot, did I scare you?

817
01:36:02,429 --> 01:36:04,497
Friends, right?

818
01:36:05,516 --> 01:36:07,375
I could use more friends.

819
01:36:10,437 --> 01:36:12,339
Couldn't you?

820
01:36:20,656 --> 01:36:22,156
Mom!

821
01:36:22,157 --> 01:36:23,808
Stop!

822
01:36:24,159 --> 01:36:25,910
Say it, OK?

823
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:27,729
Friends?

824
01:36:30,499 --> 01:36:32,150
Say it.

825
01:36:40,843 --> 01:36:42,244
Say it.

826
01:36:55,023 --> 01:36:56,591
Zai-Jian.

827
01:37:56,043 --> 01:37:58,211
Scientists had initially
discounted reports

828
01:37:58,212 --> 01:38:01,547
of solar anomalies made by
Chinese astronaut Xian Wei Ming

829
01:38:01,548 --> 01:38:04,258
one month ago, but astronomers
around the world

830
01:38:04,259 --> 01:38:06,427
are now confirming
that solar flares

831
01:38:06,428 --> 01:38:08,262
did indeed occur last week

832
01:38:08,263 --> 01:38:12,225
beginning at 8 a. m. PST
on Tuesday.

833
01:38:12,226 --> 01:38:15,019
A few hours later, a wave of
accelerated protons

834
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:17,396
hit the Chinese Space station,

835
01:38:17,397 --> 01:38:20,900
with all likelihood destroying
the bulkhead and killing Xian.

836
01:38:20,901 --> 01:38:24,654
Flaring continued with sporadic
but extreme solar winds

837
01:38:24,655 --> 01:38:27,682
and geomagnetic storms
in earth's magnetosphere.

838
01:39:04,444 --> 01:39:06,012
How's the peach?

839
01:39:07,322 --> 01:39:08,557
Good.

840
01:39:47,571 --> 01:39:48,988
Pam?

841
01:39:48,989 --> 01:39:50,849
Hmm?

842
01:39:52,034 --> 01:39:54,227
I think it's coming back.

843
01:40:29,863 --> 01:40:31,973
That's never happened before.

844
01:40:35,577 --> 01:40:37,411
Did you do that?
