Welcome to my cabin, to
our work, my getaway.

35
00:02:51,693 --> 00:02:54,870
You may be familiar with some
of my books or documentaries.

36
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:55,827
Okay, let me explain.

37
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:57,220
I'm a member of the church

38
00:02:57,307 --> 00:02:59,309
and I want to
discover who you are.

39
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,963
I want to write
a book about you,

00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,792
the millennials,
maybe, maybe let's see,

41
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,446
maybe make a documentary.

42
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,666
So I sent out the email you
got, thank you for responding

43
00:03:08,753 --> 00:03:10,146
and I selected you.

44
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,235
Not sure why, just
a gut feeling.

45
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:13,932
Talk to me about
whatever comes to mind.

46
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:15,325
What makes you
tick, your thoughts,

47
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,979
your passions,
your dreams, fears,

48
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:20,112

love, life, intimacy.

00:03:23,464 --> 00:03:26,206

that kind of stuff.

51
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,903
I've left a camera

You're on your own.

55
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,517
The girls can sleep in the
bedroom, above the garage

56
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,345
the guys can sleep in the house.

57
00:03:35,432 --> 00:03:36,781
I really appreciate your help

58
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:39,306

learning more about you.

59
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:41,438
I ordered a few pizzas for you

60
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:43,092
and please put away your phones.

61
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:45,747

- Empty bowl.

66
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,105
- Let's do it.

67
00:03:56,192 --> 00:03:56,932
- Okay.

68
00:03:58,194 --> 00:03:58,934

- So who's gonna do the video?

75
00:04:12,121 --> 00:04:14,036
- Looks pretty complicated.

76
00:04:14,123 --> 00:04:15,255
- Nah, I got it.

77
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm a film major.

78
00:04:16,343 --> 00:04:17,387
I actually played around with

79
00:04:17,474 --> 00:04:19,215
this camera in my last semester.

80
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,870
- I think we're missing someone.

81
00:04:23,132 --> 00:04:24,089

82
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:24,873

- Does anybody else think
that this is a little crazy?

88
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:34,796
Like weird?

00:04:35,927 --> 00:04:37,189

- Yeah, a little strange.

92
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:44,240
- I left something in my
truck, I'll be right back.

93
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,288

You have to make a

132
00:06:31,869 --> 00:06:32,653

00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:38,648
Getting my master's
in physics at the U.

187
00:08:38,735 --> 00:08:39,997
I'm planning to go back East

188
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,696
to get my doctorate,
MIT hopefully.

189
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:43,653
- Wow.

190
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,436
- Oh yeah.

191
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,526
- [Miguel] Cool.

192
00:08:46,613 --> 00:08:48,615
How about that
funny face though?

193
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:50,094
- Come on, lame.

194
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,053
- Come on.

195
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:52,880
- Smarty pants.

196
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:53,794
- We all did it.

197
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:54,925
- Guys, just.

198
00:08:57,493 --> 00:08:59,103
- Okay, all right.

199
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:03,368
Well, that's a start.

200
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,545
- So what are we
really doing here?

201
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,895
Why does this Fielding guy want
us to talk about ourselves?

202
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:09,287
- It was in the
email he sent us.

203
00:09:09,374 --> 00:09:10,854
He's writing a book.

204
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:13,335
Maybe doing a documentary,
some research.

205
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,032
I don't know.

206
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,556
- Well, we're here.

207
00:09:18,253 --> 00:09:19,994
Let's go do something.

208
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:21,822
- [Miguel] Yeah.

209
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:23,214
- Yeah.

210
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:24,781
- I mean I could eat.

211
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:31,179
[people yelling]
[people laughing]

212
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:55,420
- So Spielberg, how'd
you get your name?

213
00:09:55,507 --> 00:09:57,118
- My parents?

214
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,599
- I mean do you have
any middle names or?

215
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:02,427
Mexicans like to give
their kids a lot of names.

216
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:03,341
- Dude.

217
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:04,778
- Well first of all,

218
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:07,389
my families not from
Mexico, they're from Peru.

219
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:11,088
Not everything south of the
boarder is Mexico Richard.

220
00:10:11,175 --> 00:10:12,568
And yeah, my full name

221
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:16,137
is Miguel Xavier Fernando
Martinez Pablo Rivera.

222
00:10:16,224 --> 00:10:18,792
You can call me any of those.

223
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,794
- I'll go with Spielberg.

224
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,404
- I'm down with that.

225
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:24,624
- [Mollie] Here cool?

226
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:25,537
- [Cole] Yeah,
right there is fine.

227
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,148
- [Miguel] Thank you.

228
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:28,149
That was fun dude.

229
00:10:28,236 --> 00:10:29,237
- [Cole] Yeah.

230
00:10:30,281 --> 00:10:32,893
- So, anybody here married?

231
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,807
[group laughs]

232
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:34,721
Been married?

233
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:35,504
- [Man] Not a chance.

234
00:10:35,591 --> 00:10:36,461
- [Woman] Girl.

235
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:37,898
- Hey, I'm just asking.

236
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:40,552
- Okay, well then
who's not a virgin?

237
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,379
Yeah right.

238
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:42,250
- Yeah.

239
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,207
- No ones believes that.

240
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,165
- I was kidding guys.

241
00:10:44,252 --> 00:10:45,122
- Obviously.

242
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:46,863
- But seriously, who's not?

243
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,647
- All right, that's
a bit inappropriate.

244
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:48,648
- Be nice Richard.

245
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:50,258
- It's a little bit personal.

246
00:10:50,345 --> 00:10:52,782
- Isn't that what we're
doing here, getting personal?

247
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:54,479
- Let's move on.

248
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,307
- Come on, let's answer the
question, who's not a virgin?

249
00:10:56,394 --> 00:10:57,961
- Shut up Richard.

250
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,223
- That's not very nice.

251
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,616
- I wasn't trying to be nice.

252
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,966
- Come on guys, just chill.

253
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,490
- Okay.

254
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,144
Anyone been engaged.

255
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,630
- Why are you all looking at me?

256
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:16,327
- You look like you
might have been engaged.

257
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:17,241
- Really?

258
00:11:17,328 --> 00:11:18,068
- Yeah.

259
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,330
- So have you?

260
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:24,771
- All right, let's go inside.

261
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:28,470
- My bad.

262
00:11:28,557 --> 00:11:29,993
I bet he was hot.

263
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,994
- [Miguel] Anybody
ever held hands?

264
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:31,952
- [Cole] What does it matter?

265
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:32,735
- [Miguel] Shut up man.

266
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,520
[dramatic music]

267
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,447
- What's up Cole,
what's your story?

268
00:11:49,534 --> 00:11:51,580
- No story, just me.

269
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,624
- [Richard] Not buying that.

270
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,452
- [Mollie] Me neither.

271
00:11:56,367 --> 00:12:00,676
- Okay, just the normal provo,
Utah kid, nothing special.

272
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,808
Did all the right
things you know?

273
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:03,287
Duty to God award, Eagle scout.

274
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,682
- I bet he never missed
a day of seminary.

275
00:12:07,857 --> 00:12:10,817
- Into sports, baseball mainly.

276
00:12:10,904 --> 00:12:11,992
- Go Red Sox.

277
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:14,646
- Keep going.

278
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:17,998
- Senior class president,

279
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,130
look, this is pretty
boring stuff, guys.

280
00:12:20,217 --> 00:12:21,610
- We interrupt this to say

281
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:25,005
we've just found a
good little Mormon boy.

282
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:27,050
Go on.

283
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:33,665
- All right, went to the U
straight out of high school.

284
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,841
- Baseball scholarship?

285
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:35,537
- [Cole] Yeah.

286
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:36,494
- Nice

287
00:12:36,581 --> 00:12:37,887
- [Richard] Way to go Cole.

288
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:38,975
- [Miguel] Did you
go on a mission?

289
00:12:39,062 --> 00:12:39,976
- I did.

290
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,803
- Where?

291
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:45,286
- South Africa, Johannesburg.

292
00:12:45,373 --> 00:12:48,593
- [Miguel] Wow, that
must have been cool.

293
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:52,423
- So how was South Africa?

294
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,077
- It was challenging.

295
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,042
I mean, it was great, but.

296
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:04,653
- But what?

297
00:13:06,655 --> 00:13:08,439
- I got in a car accident.

298
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,267
- [Spree] What happened,
did anybody get hurt?

299
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:12,226
- Yeah, I did.

300
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,271
My right leg got
pretty jacked up

301
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,665
so they sent me home
to have surgery.

302
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:17,579
- That sucks.

303
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:18,754
- Sorry.

304
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,190
- The whole thing sucked.

305
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:23,150
- Oh, how'd the surgery go?

306
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:25,587
- Put a metal rod, bunch
of screws in my thigh.

307
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:28,416
Fixed a few things in my knee.

308
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:31,767
I mean the leg's all right,
but no more scholarship.

309
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:33,073
- Right.

310
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,336
- Other than that,
it's all good.

311
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:39,557
- It seems like there's
more to the story.

312
00:13:39,644 --> 00:13:42,822
[guitar strumming]

313
00:13:44,954 --> 00:13:47,739
- So Spielberg,
give me the camera.

314
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:52,657
How'd you get into
this whole film thing?

315
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:55,660
- Ever since I was a kid
I've wanted to make movies.

316
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,010
- [Richard] What was
the first movie you saw

317
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:58,533
that made a real
impression on you?

318
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,056
- Napoleon dynamite.

319
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,623
- You're kidding.

320
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,973
- I was nine years
old and I loved it.

321
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,062
My parents had no idea
what the movie was about.

322
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,455
- I love that movie.

323
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:08,717
- Yeah, Christmas
that year actually

324
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,327
my mom got me a video camera.

325
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,242
I've been doing it ever since.

326
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:14,462
- Okay, so what other
movies do you like?

327
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:15,289
- Oh wow.

328
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,943
Love all kinds.

329
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:21,686
The classics of the fifties,
musicals, comedies, dramas.

330
00:14:21,773 --> 00:14:23,166
Pretty much everything.

331
00:14:23,253 --> 00:14:24,080
- Favorite directors?

332
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:25,255
- Easy.

333
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:26,953
Spielberg of course.

334
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,348
Hitchcock, Scorsese,
Coppola, Woody Allen.

335
00:14:31,435 --> 00:14:33,742
James Cameron, hated
Titanic though.

336
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:34,612
- [Richard] What?

337
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,614
That was a classic.

338
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,181
- Ron Howard,
Tarantino was cool,

339
00:14:38,268 --> 00:14:39,661
but too far out for me.

340
00:14:39,748 --> 00:14:41,141
Then there's the old school,

341
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:45,275
Fellini, Ingmar Bergman,
gotta love Orson Welles.

342
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,279
Rosebud.

343
00:14:51,238 --> 00:14:52,804
Citizen Kane?

344
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,110
- I have no idea.

345
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:57,984
- Wow, okay.

346
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,768
Seriously you guys?

347
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,599
- So Spree, you're
a dancer, right?

348
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:05,643
- Yes.

349
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,471
Been dancing since I was four.

350
00:15:07,558 --> 00:15:09,256
Catherine's dance studio.

351
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:11,736
- How'd you get the name Spree?

352
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:13,173
- My dad, served a
mission in Germany

353
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,784
and there was a river
there named Spree

354
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:19,353
and he liked it so now there's
a girl here named Spree.

355
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,876
- And he likes you.

356
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:22,922
- Yeah.

357
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:25,576
- What else?

358
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,234
- I like to eat peanut butter,
pickle, and onion sandwiches.

359
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:32,018
- Ew.

360
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:32,801
- That's gross.

361
00:15:32,888 --> 00:15:34,150
- That's nasty.

362
00:15:34,237 --> 00:15:35,717
- No, guys, it's
actually way good.

363
00:15:35,804 --> 00:15:36,674
I'm gonna make you one
and you're gonna love it.

364
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:38,763
- I'm not gonna try it, so.

365
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,505
- Not gonna love
it, not gonna try.

366
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,901
All right, keep
going, keep going.

367
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:47,642
- Well most people
think I'm just

368
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,123
this shallow cheerleader
type from Montana.

369
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,037
- Yup.

370
00:15:51,124 --> 00:15:51,994
- Hey.

371
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,910
There is some truth to that.

372
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:56,477
So yeah, that's me.

373
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,435
- Oh my gosh.

374
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,002
- Oh my gosh.

375
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,743
- Loser.

376
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,831
- So sneaky.

377
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:04,876
- That's good.

378
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:06,704
- I love this game.

379
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,881
- All right, Richard,
Richard, the man of mystery.

380
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,275
You've been awfully quiet.

381
00:16:12,362 --> 00:16:13,494
What's your deal?

382
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:14,756
- Not really in the mood.

383
00:16:14,843 --> 00:16:15,844
Don't have anything to say.

384
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,628
- Yeah, you do.

385
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:18,803
I can see it.

386
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:19,848
- Really?

387
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:20,762
- Yup.

388
00:16:20,849 --> 00:16:21,763
- What do you see?

389
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,331
- Someone who's confused.

390
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:25,158
- Angry.

391
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:25,941
- Sad.

392
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:26,724
- Handsome.

393
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,638
- Really?

394
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:28,422
- Yeah.

395
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:29,379
- A sweet guy.

396
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:30,293
- Is that a compliment?

397
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,338
- Of course.

398
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,777
- So do you have anyone
significant in your life?

399
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:36,996
- Nope.

400
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,258
Well, my family.

401
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,348
- Ever had anyone significant?

402
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:42,610
- No, not really.

403
00:16:42,697 --> 00:16:44,046
- What does that mean?

404
00:16:44,133 --> 00:16:45,787
- It means I've never
had any one significant,

405
00:16:45,874 --> 00:16:48,572
I've had lots of significant's.

406
00:16:49,443 --> 00:16:50,661
At the same time.

407
00:16:50,748 --> 00:16:53,229
[group yelling]

408
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,102
- That's the way you do, huh?

409
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:59,844
- Okay guys, how about
we step this up a notch?

410
00:16:59,931 --> 00:17:00,758
Ultimate spoons.

411
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:01,890
- Yes.

412
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,329
- I am so much
better at that game.

413
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:07,765
- You've never
played this before?

414
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:08,984
- It's so fun.

415
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:11,987
[group chattering]

416
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:18,994
[people yelling]

417
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:25,870
- Sorry.

418
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:26,915
- I'm sorry, did I?

419
00:17:27,002 --> 00:17:27,698
- Yeah, you're good.

420
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:28,569
- Okay.

421
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:33,748
So Mollie, you're from Boston,

422
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:36,577
went to BC, how'd
you end up here?

423
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:42,017
- Well these missionaries seem
like they were everywhere.

424
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,236
Cute guys.

425
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,802
- Oh yeah.

426
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:47,196
- And one day they saw me.

427
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:48,980
It was raining and I
was standing underneath

428
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,853
an awning outside a
Starbucks on Beacon street

429
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,857
sipping a midnight
mint mocha frappuccino.

430
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,511
Gosh, I missed that.

431
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,080
Anyway, I was hoping
the rain had stopped

432
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,864
and they came over
and stood next to me,

433
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:05,084
started talking about Jesus.

434
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:09,566
- So how Irish
Catholic were you?

435
00:18:09,653 --> 00:18:11,002
- I don't know.

436
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,700
We only went to mass a
couple of times a year.

437
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:14,136
Christmas, Easter,

438
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:16,051
did the Holy communion
thing when I was eight.

439
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:16,965
- Interesting.

440
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,185
- Yeah, it was weird.

441
00:18:19,272 --> 00:18:20,229
I was all dressed in white

442
00:18:20,316 --> 00:18:21,970
and my family was super excited.

443
00:18:22,057 --> 00:18:23,406
I had no idea what was going on.

444
00:18:23,493 --> 00:18:25,626
Did my first penance
when I was seven.

445
00:18:25,713 --> 00:18:26,931
- What the heck is that?

446
00:18:27,018 --> 00:18:27,889
- It's where you
go to the priest

447
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:28,846
and you confess all your sins.

448
00:18:28,933 --> 00:18:30,370
- Wait, wait, wait,

449
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:32,415
you had sin to confess
when you were seven?

450
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,417
- I'm from Boston,
of course I did.

451
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:37,028
[all laughing]

452
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:41,163
- Yeah, I'm just kidding,
I can't remember.

453
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,817
But the missionaries
got to talking

454
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:45,776
and kept raining,
the more it rained,

455
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,604
the more interesting they got.

456
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:49,867
Pretty soon right
there on Beacon street

457
00:18:49,954 --> 00:18:51,913
we're talking about Joseph
Smith and the book of Mormon.

458
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,001
- What was your reaction?

459
00:18:53,088 --> 00:18:54,307
- Well first I thought they were

460
00:18:54,394 --> 00:18:55,960
talking about the
Broadway musical

461
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,962
and that some guy named Joseph
Smith was starring in it.

462
00:18:58,049 --> 00:18:58,746
- No way.

463
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,095
- I had no idea

464
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,229
But I don't, I don't know.

465
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:07,668
Thought it was interesting.

466
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:10,845
I wasn't looking for
anything like God, you know,

467
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:13,108
hadn't really thought about it.

468
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:16,981
But all of a sudden I
was thinking about it.

469
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:25,033
[bell rings]

470
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,515
- Is Oscar fielding here?

471
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:29,342
- No.

472
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,386
- No.

473
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:31,213
- [Man] You're not Mr. Fielding?

474
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,301
- Nope.

475
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:33,084
- No.

476
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,129
- No.

477
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:34,912
- Is this his house.

478
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:35,609
- Yeah.

479
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,045
- Yeah.

480
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:39,482
- Are you sure I'm
at the right place?

481
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:42,572
- We're pretty
hungry, pizza guy.

482
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,748
Can we have the pizzas?

483
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:45,619
- Okay.

484
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,104
- Thanks pizza guy.

485
00:19:55,368 --> 00:19:56,630
- Thank you.

486
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,500
- Drinks.

487
00:20:00,938 --> 00:20:01,722
- Bye.

488
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:07,902
[group laughs]

489
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:09,425
Did you see his face?

490
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:12,472
[people chattering]

491
00:20:28,096 --> 00:20:30,359
- So Riley, you
were weren't you?

492
00:20:30,446 --> 00:20:31,839
- What?

493
00:20:31,926 --> 00:20:33,057
- Engaged.

494
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,015
- Drop it.

495
00:20:36,974 --> 00:20:38,889
- Actually, yeah, I was.

496
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:41,022
- What happened?

497
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,024
- Who dumped who?

498
00:20:43,111 --> 00:20:44,504
- He didn't dump me.

499
00:20:44,591 --> 00:20:46,157
- So you dumped him?

500
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,289
- Kinda.

501
00:20:47,376 --> 00:20:48,290
- Kinda?

502
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:49,248
You either did or you didn't.

503
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:50,510
- Right, right, fine.

504
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:52,076
I dumped him.

505
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,295
- Why?

506
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:54,818
- Oh.

507
00:20:54,905 --> 00:20:56,733
- We're just being
honest here Riley.

508
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,560
Open.

509
00:20:58,866 --> 00:20:59,606
- Look.

510
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,785
Okay, yeah.

511
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:10,573
He and I had been dating
since high school.

512
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,227
He was a couple of years older.

513
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,534
Anyway, he went to
college, it was nearby.

514
00:21:14,621 --> 00:21:16,405
So he lived at home.

515
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,842
We're in the same ward.

516
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,932
I used to like to see him
bless the sacrament on Sundays.

517
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:22,890
- Cool.

518
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:23,499
- Did he go on a mission?

519
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:24,805
- Yeah.

520
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:26,459
- Did you date
while he was gone?

521
00:21:26,546 --> 00:21:27,503
- [Riley] Kinda.

522
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,070
- Kinda?

523
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,899
- Yes, yes I did but
not, you know, seriously.

524
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,860
- [Miguel] What happened
when he got back?

525
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:41,778
- That's a big, no.

526
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:43,214
We're shut down.

527
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,653
- So Mollie, it's your turn.

528
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,134
- Wildest thing that's
ever happened to you?

529
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,048
- Not going there.

530
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,311
- No, I want to hear this.

531
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:53,442
- Come on, come on.

532
00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:55,096
- I know you have good stories.

533
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,185
- No, I am from Boston, that
should pretty much cover it.

534
00:21:57,272 --> 00:21:58,012
- Not even.

535
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,884
[group chattering]

536
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:02,582
- Okay, okay.

537
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,279
All right.

538
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:06,368
It's not the wildest thing
that ever happened to me,

539
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:10,024
but I got pepper sprayed
my freshman year.

540
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,244
- No, what?

541
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:15,551
- Why, how?

542
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:16,509
- [Mollie] It's a long story.

543
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:17,205
- No.

544
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,119
- [Richard] And?

545
00:22:18,206 --> 00:22:19,425
- Okay, what happened?

546
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,513
- [All] Come on.

547
00:22:22,253 --> 00:22:24,952
- Okay so Mollie, what's with
all the Shakespeare stuff?

548
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,607
- Oh, I just love Shakespeare.

549
00:22:27,694 --> 00:22:29,086
I studied him all
through high school,

550
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:31,132
was in a couple of plays

551
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:34,004
and then I was an
English major at BC

552
00:22:34,091 --> 00:22:35,832
with a Shakespeare emphasis.

553
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,094
- [Richard] Did you
ever play Juliet?

554
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,922
- No, Lady Macbeth.

555
00:22:40,881 --> 00:22:41,664
- Yes.

556
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:45,581
- Seems so weird to me.

557
00:22:45,668 --> 00:22:47,191
- You have heard of
Shakespeare right?

558
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:48,497
- Yeah, but I don't--

559
00:22:48,584 --> 00:22:50,586
- I just love the guy, okay?

560
00:22:51,979 --> 00:22:53,284
When my parents
were going through

561
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,331
their divorce his
thoughts on love,

562
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:59,378
life, fear, anger, grief,

563
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,340
it just kind of got me
through the whole thing.

564
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,298
The Bard was sort
of my scripture

565
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,822
before I found the real stuff.

566
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,171
- That's cool.

567
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:12,478
- [Miguel] That's
awesome, that's awesome.

568
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,218
- Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

569
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:19,267
[upbeat music]
[group chattering]

570
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:24,403
- Chubby bunny.

571
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,231
[upbeat music]

572
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:40,244
- [Spree] You have
to say chubby bunny.

573
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:41,245
- [Mollie] You have to say it.

574
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:44,292
[Cole mumbling]

575
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,816
- And now we just dance.

576
00:23:46,903 --> 00:23:47,600
- Nice.

577
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:50,385
[upbeat music]

578
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,302
- Come on, bring it in.

579
00:23:55,216 --> 00:23:56,435
Oh what's that?

580
00:23:56,522 --> 00:24:01,396
[upbeat music]
[group chattering]

581
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,321
- That's how they
do it at the Y huh?

582
00:24:13,408 --> 00:24:18,369
[upbeat music]
[group chattering]

583
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,354
[door creaks]

584
00:24:46,441 --> 00:24:47,529
- Look what I found.

585
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,965
- Oh my God.

586
00:24:49,052 --> 00:24:52,447
- This stuff is
seriously the best.

587
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:53,361
- Oh nice.

588
00:24:53,448 --> 00:24:54,318
- Have you ever had that?

589
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:55,232
- Yes I have.

590
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,277
- It's my favorite brand.

591
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:57,060
Don't tell the boys.

592
00:24:57,147 --> 00:24:58,366
- I will not.

593
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,020
That spoon thing was crazy.

594
00:25:00,107 --> 00:25:02,718
- I know, that is one of
my families FAT games.

595
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:03,676
- Oh yeah?

596
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:04,894
Hey Mollie.

597
00:25:04,981 --> 00:25:05,721
- Hey.

598
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,245
- This is for you.

599
00:25:08,332 --> 00:25:10,552
- Thank you, gratzie.

600
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,771
- So where did you grow up?

601
00:25:11,858 --> 00:25:13,424
- Everywhere.

602
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:17,211
My dads a big shot in the
air force so born in Germany,

603
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:20,170
lived in California,
Japan, Turkey.

604
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:23,260
Ended up at the Pentagon.

605
00:25:23,347 --> 00:25:24,479
You?

606
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:27,090
- Oh, just Montana, and here.

607
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:32,400
I did spend a little
bit of time in Colorado.

608
00:26:04,867 --> 00:26:07,566
- So, why'd you
transfer for UVU?

609
00:26:10,351 --> 00:26:11,657
- UVA.

610
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:13,354
- Right, Virginia.

611
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:17,532
- Yeah, just wanted to get away.

612
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,448
You can really dance girl.

613
00:26:20,535 --> 00:26:21,318
- Thanks.

614
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:25,932
Goodnight Spree.

615
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:31,590
- Goodnight.

616
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,079
[light clicks]

617
00:26:59,182 --> 00:27:00,793
- Wasn't sure you'd come.

618
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,272
- Neither was I.

619
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:14,633
It's pretty.

620
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,460
- Yeah it is.

621
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:19,289
Can I show you something?

622
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:20,160
- Sure.

623
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:25,513
- Take a moment and breath
in the mountain air.

624
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,908
Listen to the wind
blow through the trees.

625
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:34,609
- Yeah, it's weird how
you can't see the wind,

626
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,481
how you can only feel it.

627
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:39,658
- Yeah, kinda like God.

628
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:41,660
- Yeah, kinda.

629
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:44,663
- Kind of.

630
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,884
- Are you smiling Cole?

631
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:51,147
- Yeah, you make me smile?

632
00:27:53,454 --> 00:27:57,676
Anyway, above the wind and
trees you got the stars,

633
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:02,637
planets, constellations,
galaxies.

634
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,684
- And what else?

635
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:09,383
- It's a new moon.

636
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,167
Saturn's the most visible
planet this time of year,

637
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:15,215
and when it's dark like
this in the mountains

638
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:16,520
you can see everything,
it's remarkable.

639
00:28:16,607 --> 00:28:19,088
The whole Milky Way and more.

640
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,004
- Keep going.

641
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:25,573
- Mars and mercury
won't be visible

642
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:29,316
for another month or so
but, well there's Polaris.

643
00:28:32,232 --> 00:28:35,409
The North star, the
big dipper, Orion,

644
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:43,199
but Venus, the planet
of love and beauty

645
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:48,683
won't be visible for
another few weeks.

646
00:28:51,991 --> 00:28:53,732
- So how do you know
about all this stuff?

647
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:57,126
- Spent some time on
a ranch in New Mexico.

648
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,607
- So you're a cowboy Cole.

649
00:28:59,694 --> 00:29:01,087
- No, not really.

650
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,831
- So did you have anyone to look

651
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:08,747
at the stars with in New Mexico?

652
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,357
- No.

653
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:12,054
- Why not?

654
00:29:12,141 --> 00:29:15,144
- I was there with a bunch of
guys, sort of a work thing.

655
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:15,841
- Sorry.

656
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,540
- I'm not, it was good for me.

657
00:29:21,063 --> 00:29:24,588
Besides, I had the stars
to give me company.

658
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:38,602
Cold?

659
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:41,257
[gentle music]

660
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,389
Who was that guy who dropped
you off this morning?

661
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,216
- You saw that.

662
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,348
- I did.

663
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:29,218
- Jealous?

664
00:30:30,089 --> 00:30:30,829
- Curious.

665
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,051
- He's just a friend.

666
00:30:36,138 --> 00:30:38,837
[gentle music]

667
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:55,418
Cole.

668
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,943
[gentle music]

669
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:37,765
[Mollie yawns]

670
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:38,940
- [Richard] Wow, what
happened to you guys?

671
00:31:39,027 --> 00:31:40,507
- Shut up Richard.

672
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:41,377
- Wow.

673
00:31:42,683 --> 00:31:43,379

674
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:44,293
- Morning Riley.

675
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,207
- It's hot.

676
00:31:46,774 --> 00:31:48,819
- [Miguel] Smell amazing.

677
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:52,301
- This looks so good.

678
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:53,912
- This is beautiful.

679
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,697
Thanks Richard.

680
00:31:56,784 --> 00:31:59,874
Oh, shouldn't we say
a blessing first?

681
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:00,483
I'll say it.

682
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:03,225
Our dear kind and
gracious heavenly father.

683
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:04,966
We are grateful for
this beautiful day

684
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:06,315
and for this breakfast

685
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:09,275
and for Richard who prepared it.

686
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:10,667
We pray that we will
have a great day

687
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,104
and we love the father

688
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,496
and we say these things

689
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:15,672
in the name of thy son,
Jesus Christ, amen.

690
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:16,891
- [All] Amen.

691
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,680
- Sup, Richard you a chef?

692
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,987
- You serve a mission to France,

693
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:28,250
you learned a lot about cuisine.

694
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:29,425
- Do you still speak French?

695
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:30,905
- Course.

696
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,863
- [Mollie] Well say
something in French.

697
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,777
- Really?

698
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:34,996
- Yeah.

699
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:35,866
- Okay.

700
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,391
[speaking in foreign language]

701
00:32:38,478 --> 00:32:40,045
- [Spree] Oh, what's that mean?

702
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,220
- Something in French.

703
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,222
- No really, say something.

704
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:44,963
- No, I just did,

705
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,835
[speaking in foreign language]
is something in French.

706
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,402
- Yeah, but what?

707
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:51,534
- Something in French.

708
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:52,492
- Richard.

709
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,319
- Oh, Spree.

710
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:58,498
- Spree, Spree, [speaking
in foreign language],

711
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:02,676
whatever he said, means
something in French,

712
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:04,243
that's what it means.

713
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,985
- Jerk, okay, well
say some more.

714
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:12,207
[speaking in foreign language]

715
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,518
- Okay, I'm just going to
interrupt you right there

716
00:33:18,605 --> 00:33:20,737
and say that that
is really sexy.

717
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:21,434
- Mm hmm.

718
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:26,265
- I'm not like the first girl
has ever told you that, right?

719
00:33:26,352 --> 00:33:27,092
- No.

720
00:33:38,494 --> 00:33:41,454
[people chattering]

721
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,941
- What are you guys doing?

722
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,726
- Just cooling off.

723
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,075
- [Richard] It's
freezing out here.

724
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:55,903
- It's beautiful though.

725
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,035
- Yeah it is.

726
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:01,126
- How's your social
life Richard?

727
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:03,128
- Non-existing.

728
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:05,173
- [Mollie] When was
your first kiss?

729
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,783
- High school?

730
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,394
- Was it electrifying?

731
00:34:08,481 --> 00:34:09,699
- Shut up.

732
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:10,831
- Were there fireworks?

733
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,789
- No, not really.

734
00:34:12,876 --> 00:34:14,356
- They must not
have done it, right?

735
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:16,489
- Oh, that's a
distinct possibility.

736
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:19,448
- When was your last kiss?

737
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:21,407
- It's been awhile.

738
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,365
- [Mollie] You're
missing out, dude.

739
00:34:23,452 --> 00:34:26,107
- I think I see life a little
differently than you guys do.

740
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,980
- Differently, so you
don't connect with us?

741
00:34:31,634 --> 00:34:33,680
- I think you guys are great.

742
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:35,290
- But no connection?

743
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,990
- Well, what kind of connection
are we talking about?

744
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,818
- [Moly] Connection.

745
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:44,038
- Like Riley and Cole?

746
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,735
- Yeah, like them.

747
00:34:47,563 --> 00:34:48,825
- I don't know.

748
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:50,610
- Bummer.

749
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:54,701
- I don't really want to be
like Riley and Cole anyway.

750
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,398
- They're disgusting.

751
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,271
- It's only been one day,
I mean give me a break.

752
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:00,663
- It's a lot of
pending for one day.

753
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,490
- It's a lot.

754
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:04,319
[Miguel singing]

755
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,113
[Miguel cries out]

756
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,811
- Dude, are you
kidding me, dude?

757
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,074
Grow up dude.

758
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,772
What the freak, that was cold.

759
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:27,690
- More grief to hide,
than hate to water love.

760
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:28,561
It's beautiful right.

761
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:30,040
- It's gorgeous.

762
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,216
- [Mollie] Do you even
know what it means?

763
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:33,305
- [Miguel] Not a clue.

764
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:34,958
- [Spree] Hey guys,
come check this out.

765
00:35:35,045 --> 00:35:36,699
Look who I found on Facebook.

766
00:35:36,786 --> 00:35:38,310
It's Riley.

767
00:35:38,397 --> 00:35:40,050
Oh my gosh, you're so cute.

768
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,878
You're so cute.

769
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,837
- Hey, is this your ex?

770
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:49,582
Hey, what happened
with him anyway?

771
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:51,061
- Yeah.

772
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,413
How did it go when he got
back from his mission?

773
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,197
- Well, it was like
Disneyland, my birthday,

774
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:57,894
and Christmas all
rolled into one.

775
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:59,374
- Dang.

776
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:01,768
Somehow it just didn't
work out, did it?

777
00:36:01,855 --> 00:36:03,291
- Nope.

778
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:05,946
- How long did it take
for him to propose?

779
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,165
- About a month.

780
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,209
- Details?

781
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:09,993
- Details, details.

782
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:15,825
- He rented a billboard
on the freeway.

783
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:19,264
Yeah, one of the
electronic kinds

784
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:22,832
and just flashing really
cute pictures of us.

785
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:23,790
- Romantic.

786
00:36:23,877 --> 00:36:25,618
- Seems a bit much.

787
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,533
- Yeah, yeah, yeah he took us

788
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,057
to a quiet place where we
could see the billboard.

789
00:36:30,144 --> 00:36:31,841
It was like at 10:30 at night.

790
00:36:31,928 --> 00:36:33,974
And as we leaned against
the front of his car

791
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:38,196
he got down on one knee
and asked me to marry him.

792
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:42,200
- [Richard] And were your
parents okay with this?

793
00:36:42,287 --> 00:36:43,418
- Sort of.

794
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:45,638
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.

795
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:47,901
I was only 19 at the time.

796
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:49,642
- Wow.

797
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,339
- Yeah, yeah.

798
00:36:51,426 --> 00:36:54,864
So my dad told me, he thought
I should just take it slow

799
00:36:54,951 --> 00:36:58,477
and you know, fast
and pray about it.

800
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:03,177
The standard Mormon response
to pretty much everything.

801
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:04,047
- Did you?

802
00:37:04,134 --> 00:37:05,701
- No, not really.

803
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,836
I thought I knew
what I was doing

804
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:14,449
and I mean we'd been dating
for, at that point, 3 years.

805
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,062
Yeah, three years.

806
00:37:19,149 --> 00:37:23,415
So just seemed like
the logical next step.

807
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:25,155
- Did he get you a ring?

808
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,722
- A gorgeous ring.

809
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:29,334
Yeah, and we
started making plans

810
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,988
and I couldn't stop staring

811
00:37:32,075 --> 00:37:34,600
at my hands smiling,

812
00:37:34,687 --> 00:37:39,082
but well now I have a
CTR ring on that finger

813
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:40,519
just to remind me,

814
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:48,266
but yeah, I had to tell that
story about a million times.

815
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:51,181
- So engagement
pictures, Facebook,

816
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,880
Instagram, honeymoon plans?

817
00:37:53,967 --> 00:37:55,229
- [Riley] All of the above.

818
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,535
- Oh gosh.

819
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:58,014
- What happened?

820
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,282
- Come on guys.

821
00:38:08,895 --> 00:38:10,505
- Richard, what's up?

822
00:38:11,637 --> 00:38:12,942
- Nothing.

823
00:38:13,029 --> 00:38:15,075
- Well, what do you like
to do, in to sports?

824
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:16,206
- Nope.

825
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,077
- [Cole] Why not?

826
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:18,470
- What's it to you?

827
00:38:18,557 --> 00:38:20,385
- Just making
conversation, Richard,

828
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:22,474
you know, getting
to know each other.

829
00:38:22,561 --> 00:38:23,997
- All right.

830
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,651
When I was about five,
they found out I had

831
00:38:25,738 --> 00:38:28,958
a heart condition,
irregular rhythm thing.

832
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,438
I mean, it's fine now,

833
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:33,311
but my parents were
pretty conservative.

834
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:36,096
I wanted play sports
in high school

835
00:38:36,183 --> 00:38:38,359
but they wouldn't
sign off on it.

836
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:39,926
- And what'd you
do in high school?

837
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,449
- You know that
there's more to do

838
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:44,322
in high school then
just sports Spielberg.

839
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:45,453
I studied a lot.

840
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,413
I got great grades, drama club.

841
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,544
- Hey.

842
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:52,155
- I was in a Romeo and Juliet.

843
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,418
It was a disaster.

844
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:54,593
Group laughs.

845
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,204
- Did you play Romeo?

846
00:38:57,291 --> 00:38:58,379
- Juliet.

847
00:38:58,466 --> 00:38:59,859
- That makes sense.

848
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,297
- Like I said, it
was a disaster,

849
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,081
but I was in the chess club.

850
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:06,518
- That's really lame.

851
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:08,346
- I know, I know.

852
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:09,999
Oh, I was a one team.

853
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:10,826
- [Cole] Which one?

854
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:11,958
- The debate team.

855
00:39:12,045 --> 00:39:13,046
- That's not a team.

856
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,526
- [Mollie] That does not count.

857
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,136
- You get a letter
mans jacket for that?

858
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:18,834
- Hey, hey, whoa, you can
laugh but it was cool.

859
00:39:18,921 --> 00:39:21,750
I mean we took state,
no one even came close.

860
00:39:21,837 --> 00:39:23,186
- Fair enough.

861
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:25,232
- So I was in chess
club, drama club,

862
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:27,147
debate team, physics club.

863
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:28,931
Oh, even the Latin club

864
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:30,280
Thought it might come in handy

865
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:33,762
if I went into medicine,
or Roman mythology,

866
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:36,765
or if I wanted to be a botanist.

867
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:38,332
I was a real social
animal in high school.

868
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:39,115
- [Miguel] Really?

869
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,247
- No.

870
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,380
[group laughs]

871
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,120
- So you ever been engaged?

872
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,558
- Is that a serious question?

873
00:39:46,645 --> 00:39:47,472
- Guess not

874
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:51,389
- So Cole.

875
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:54,348
Did you finish your
mission to South Africa?

876
00:39:54,435 --> 00:39:56,219
- Actually, no.

877
00:39:56,306 --> 00:39:56,959
- [Richard] Why not?

878
00:39:57,046 --> 00:39:58,396
The leg was okay.

879
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:02,138
- True, but it took
some time to heal.

880
00:40:02,225 --> 00:40:04,402
- Did you want to go back?

881
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:06,708
- Too many memories?

882
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,406
- Too many questions.

883
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,107
- Still seems like
there's more to the story.

884
00:40:14,194 --> 00:40:14,977
- Yeah.

885
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:19,460
- Hey.

886
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:20,330
- Hey.

887
00:40:21,767 --> 00:40:22,985
- You okay?

888
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:25,074
- Yeah, I'm fine.

889
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,294
- You said there was
more to the story.

890
00:40:27,381 --> 00:40:29,992
- I didn't say
that, Richard did.

891
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:30,950
- Is there?

892
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:38,784
- When I was in the hospital,
an infection set in.

893
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,003
There was a lot of pain and I
was taking all kinds of meds.

894
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,701
- What kinds?

895
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:45,138
- The normal kinds of
painkillers they give you.

896
00:40:45,225 --> 00:40:46,618
- Heavy duty stuff?

897
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,446
- Yeah, pretty much.

898
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,232
- You got hooked on them.

899
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,407
Didn't you?

900
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:57,367
- Yeah, I did.

901
00:41:00,501 --> 00:41:05,288
- So that's why you didn't
go back to Johannesburg.

902
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:06,942
- You could say that

903
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:27,310
- Spree, something personal.

904
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:29,095
Okay, most interesting thing
that's ever happened to you.

905
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,444
- Yeah, let's hear it.

906
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:32,664
- Interesting, personal.

907
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,361
- Hey, it's okay.

908
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:37,799
I mean, Riley was engaged and
she totally screwed that up.

909
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,410
Richard has no idea who he is.

910
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,283
Cole did drugs, and Miguel's
a want to be film guy,

911
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,285
and I'm just a
Shakespeare freak.

912
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:46,329
We're all just your average,

913
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:49,463
everyday, LDS millennials honey.

914
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,815
- Cheerleader, dancer, I
have a gun in my backpack.

915
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:56,296
That isn't personal
enough for you guys?

916
00:41:56,383 --> 00:41:57,253
- [Miguel] No way.

917
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,298
- Come on, let's hear it.

918
00:41:58,385 --> 00:41:59,212
- Personal.

919
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,566
I dunno.

920
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:07,612
- You're thinking of something.

921
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:08,482
- Yeah?

922
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:12,355
- Okay, when was
your first kiss?

923
00:42:12,442 --> 00:42:14,096
- Oh, wow.

924
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:16,272
- [Mollie] How old were you?

925
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:17,360
- Let's see.

926
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:18,971
14.

927
00:42:20,015 --> 00:42:20,712
- Wow

928
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,235
- Young.

929
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:23,845
- You weren't even old
enough to date yet.

930
00:42:23,932 --> 00:42:25,107
- Was he cute?

931
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:27,022
- Yeah, he was my boyfriend.

932
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,371
- Was it good?

933
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:30,199
- [Spree] I guess.

934
00:42:30,286 --> 00:42:31,287
- What else?

935
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,206
- I don't know.

936
00:42:37,293 --> 00:42:38,512
- Spit it out.

937
00:42:46,781 --> 00:42:49,305
- I had a baby when I was 15.

938
00:42:52,265 --> 00:42:54,180
That's pretty personal.

939
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:58,488
- Yeah, it is.

940
00:43:03,624 --> 00:43:05,583
- Same guy who kissed you?

941
00:43:08,063 --> 00:43:08,803
- Wow, 15.

942
00:43:11,937 --> 00:43:14,504
Did you think about
having an abortion?

943
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,549
- Mollie.

944
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:16,419
- Don't, jeez.

945
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:17,464
- [Cole] Mollie.

946
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:18,334
- That's insensitive.

947
00:43:18,421 --> 00:43:19,379
- What?

948
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:20,946
It's a legit question.

949
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:22,469
- Yeah, it is guys.

950
00:43:24,732 --> 00:43:26,778
My boyfriend's
parents wanted me to,

951
00:43:26,865 --> 00:43:28,823
you know get an abortion

952
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:33,523
but that was never really
an option, you know?

953
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:37,353
- How'd it happen?

954
00:43:40,835 --> 00:43:43,229
- We'd been dating for a while.

955
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:44,970
Kind of behind my parents' back.

956
00:43:45,057 --> 00:43:46,536
And then one night.

957
00:43:49,975 --> 00:43:51,585
- Did he rape you?

958
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,894
- No, no, he didn't.

959
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,682
You know, it's funny.

960
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,379
There's a period of time

961
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:05,643
when you don't know
if you're pregnant

962
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:08,297
and it's just sort
of this waiting game.

963
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:10,299
- You didn't tell your parents?

964
00:44:10,386 --> 00:44:12,040
- No, not right away.

965
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:16,392
I went online asking questions.

966
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:17,872
I was just so young.

967
00:44:17,959 --> 00:44:20,527
I didn't know anything.

968
00:44:20,614 --> 00:44:23,008
We never really talked about
that kind of stuff at home.

969
00:44:23,095 --> 00:44:24,923
- He must've freaked out.

970
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:25,750
- Yeah.

971
00:44:27,273 --> 00:44:29,579
You know you think
there's very little chance

972
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,495
that you could
actually be pregnant,

973
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:34,497
but then you're late.

974
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:36,978
- Late for what?

975
00:44:38,545 --> 00:44:40,329
- Seriously?

976
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:41,679
- Late Spielberg.

977
00:44:42,767 --> 00:44:44,638
- Right, got it, sorry.

978
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:50,905
- Time went by, I kept hoping.

979
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,517
- And what'd you do?

980
00:44:54,604 --> 00:44:58,434
- I finally rode my bike
down to the drug store.

981
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:02,177
It was an old, pink bike
with a basket in front

982
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:05,790
and streamers on the handlebars.

983
00:45:05,877 --> 00:45:07,617
It's big fat tires.

984
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:12,579
I'd heard about pregnancy tests.

985
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:16,278
Never thought that
I'd have to buy one.

986
00:45:16,365 --> 00:45:17,627
I didn't want to go home

987
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,675
so I stopped at this
old rundown gas station.

988
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:28,029
And as I sat there on the
toilet in this bathroom,

989
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:32,120
just staring at the thing

990
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,515
I'd never been so
scared in my life.

991
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:37,212
- I can't even imagine.

992
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:41,216
- I mean, what was I going
to do if I was pregnant?

993
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:42,478
I was only 15.

994
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:47,440
I just sat there and
stared at the thing.

995
00:45:47,527 --> 00:45:51,618
One line, not pregnant,
two lines, pregnant.

996
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:54,621
And sure enough, two
little red lines.

997
00:45:59,234 --> 00:46:02,585
The kit came with two
so I tried it again.

998
00:46:02,672 --> 00:46:04,805
- And what'd you do?

999
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:07,808
- I just sat there
on the toilet,

1000
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:10,550
in that disgusting bathroom

1001
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:13,727
flies buzzing around
smelled so bad

1002
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,686
and the sink was filthy

1003
00:46:18,558 --> 00:46:21,082
and I just cried, long and hard.

1004
00:46:23,737 --> 00:46:27,349
I think balled would
be a better word.

1005
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:28,960
Must have been pretty loud

1006
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:33,051
because the guy at the gas
station, he was really nice.

1007
00:46:34,661 --> 00:46:36,576
He knocked on the door
to see if I was okay.

1008
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:39,797
And I told him I was
having a bad day.

1009
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:44,453
Yeah, I was having a bad day.

1010
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:49,763
- How'd your parents take it?

1011
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:51,852
- My mom was cool about it.

1012
00:46:53,071 --> 00:46:54,420
Actually think she was pregnant

1013
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:56,683
with me when my
parents got married.

1014
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:59,642
I'm not sure, maybe not,

1015
00:46:59,729 --> 00:47:02,428
but my dad just said something

1016
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:05,823
about being more careful
and walked out of the room.

1017
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:08,695
- Did you stay in school?

1018
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:11,045
- It was the summer
after my sophomore year.

1019
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:13,656
And my parents decided
to send me to Colorado,

1020
00:47:13,743 --> 00:47:16,877
to live with my grandparents
and have my baby.

1021
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,661
My grandparents were great.

1022
00:47:18,748 --> 00:47:20,054
Really cool.

1023
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:22,404
It was actually my
grandma who introduced me

1024
00:47:22,491 --> 00:47:25,799
to the peanut butter,
pickle and onion sandwiches.

1025
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:29,585
She said it was all she could
eat when she was pregnant.

1026
00:47:29,672 --> 00:47:31,500
- Where's the baby now?

1027
00:47:32,414 --> 00:47:33,894
- He's in Montana.

1028
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:36,375
- So your mom's raising him.

1029
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,378
- That's good.

1030
00:47:39,465 --> 00:47:41,859
So you still get to see him?

1031
00:47:41,946 --> 00:47:42,729
- Yeah.

1032
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:45,906
Yeah, I see him, I do.

1033
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,747
[water splashes]

1034
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,887
[Spree crying]

1035
00:48:53,713 --> 00:48:55,106
- Spree, I'm sorry.

1036
00:49:01,721 --> 00:49:03,331
I think you're amazing.

1037
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:04,158
- Thanks.

1038
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:19,869
- What do you think
Oscar is going

1039
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,090
to do with this
video, we're making?

1040
00:49:23,177 --> 00:49:25,527
Better not put it on YouTube.

1041
00:49:25,614 --> 00:49:27,225
- Yeah, I'm sure he's
not going to do that.

1042
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:29,923
- [Riley] No really, are
we the normal millennials?

1043
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,186
- [Mollie] I'm not sure
that's what Fielding wants.

1044
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:35,755
- You guys are making me feel
more normal all the time.

1045
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:38,279
- Do we really want to
tell him our stories?

1046
00:49:38,366 --> 00:49:39,280
I mean, is that what we agreed

1047
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,717
to when we answered the email?

1048
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:43,937
- Yeah, I think it is.

1049
00:49:44,024 --> 00:49:45,895
- I don't know.

1050
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,810
It just seems like
all the fun's gone.

1051
00:49:47,897 --> 00:49:49,464
We're all a mess.

1052
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,553
- Not Spielberg.

1053
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:53,164
- Is that what he's
after the mess?

1054
00:49:53,251 --> 00:49:54,295
- Are we sure that
we want to share

1055
00:49:54,382 --> 00:49:56,515
our stuff with the world?

1056
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:57,864
- Yeah, I don't know

1057
00:49:57,951 --> 00:50:00,736
because I thought it
would be more political

1058
00:50:00,823 --> 00:50:03,783
or religious,
socials, not personal.

1059
00:50:05,045 --> 00:50:08,527
- Well, now it's
pretty personal.

1060
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:10,877
- Are you bailing
on us, Richard?

1061
00:50:10,964 --> 00:50:13,184
- Yeah, yeah, I think I am.

1062
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:16,883
I just met you guys, now
I'm talking about stuff

1063
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:18,363
I don't want to talk about.

1064
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:19,712
- Nobody's judging you.

1065
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:21,061
We all have our issues.

1066
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:22,802
- Not like me you don't.

1067
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,717
- Oh, poor Richard.

1068
00:50:24,804 --> 00:50:27,285
His story is just
so hard to tell.

1069
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:31,724
- Well I'm not buying it,
you just don't trust us.

1070
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:33,030
- Why should I trust you?

1071
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:34,988
- That's a good question.

1072
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:37,034
Let's put it out to the group.

1073
00:50:37,121 --> 00:50:38,252
Why do we trust?

1074
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:41,734
- Well, Hemingway said
the best way to find out

1075
00:50:41,821 --> 00:50:44,867
if you can trust somebody
is to trust them.

1076
00:50:44,954 --> 00:50:45,999
- I'm good.

1077
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:46,913
- Same.

1078
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,740
- I'm in.

1079
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:51,309
- All right, you know what?

1080
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:53,746
Here's what I see when
I look around the room.

1081
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:56,836
I see a bunch of people
trying to figure out life,

1082
00:50:56,923 --> 00:50:59,969
trying to live a gospel
that's challenging to live.

1083
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,449
- It's got a great
retirement plan.

1084
00:51:01,536 --> 00:51:05,192
- Yeah but the benefits
come at the end.

1085
00:51:05,279 --> 00:51:06,802
- What about now?

1086
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:08,978
- I get payments along the way.

1087
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:10,502
- Okay, fine.

1088
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:13,418
But the big benefits
come at the very end.

1089
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:15,855
And that's what we
really want, isn't it?

1090
00:51:15,942 --> 00:51:18,031
Sorta like this, this big fat,

1091
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,946
juicy carrot dangling out there,

1092
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,514
enticing us with stuff we
can't really understand.

1093
00:51:22,601 --> 00:51:23,863
- Like what?

1094
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,386
- Like mansions,
eternity, living with God

1095
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:28,041
and families are forever.

1096
00:51:28,128 --> 00:51:32,219
I just, anything about
eternity, it sounds great

1097
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:36,571
but I honestly don't really
know what it all means.

1098
00:51:39,966 --> 00:51:41,533
Do you?

1099
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,144
- For me it means
living each day,

1100
00:51:44,231 --> 00:51:47,495
the best that I can and hoping

1101
00:51:47,582 --> 00:51:50,759
that it all works
out in the end.

1102
00:51:50,846 --> 00:51:53,719
- I wish I could see
it like that Spree.

1103
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:54,763
I really do.

1104
00:51:57,636 --> 00:51:59,072
I'm done with this.

1105
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:01,770
- Hey.

1106
00:52:01,857 --> 00:52:02,902
- What?

1107
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,773
- Come on, you can't leave now.

1108
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,340
You're part of us.

1109
00:52:06,427 --> 00:52:08,734
- I don't really feel
like a part of you.

1110
00:52:08,821 --> 00:52:10,910
- So you're just going
to walk out, huh?

1111
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:12,912
What are you afraid of Richard?

1112
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:14,653
That we're going to peek into
the corners of your life.

1113
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,350
See something in
you we don't like.

1114
00:52:16,437 --> 00:52:18,874
- No, I think I might see
things in me that I don't like.

1115
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:21,138
- That's what we're
doing here, Richard.

1116
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:24,576
No one's judging anybody,
nobody's pointing fingers.

1117
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:27,492
We have a chance to
tell a story, our story.

1118
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:29,755
A story that could
actually make a difference.

1119
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:33,106
Isn't that what our
generation is all about?

1120
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:34,803
To show our neighbors

1121
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,501
and the people that we go
to church with that yeah,

1122
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:38,938
everybody's sitting at
church on Sunday mornings

1123
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:41,506
has issues that nobody
else is aware of.

1124
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:43,072
And you want to walk
on it because of what?

1125
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,639
You think no one else has
the same issues as you do?

1126
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:46,119
Well, trust me,
Richard, they do.

1127
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:48,556
- We already talked
about the trust thing.

1128
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:50,079
- All right, so you sit back

1129
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,604
and watch Spree open
up and spill her guts.

1130
00:52:52,691 --> 00:52:55,128
Riley, me, you're not alone.

1131
00:52:55,215 --> 00:52:57,217
No, he needs to hear
this, you're not alone.

1132
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,654
You're not the only one
going through stuff, man.

1133
00:52:59,741 --> 00:53:01,656
And now you want
to walk out on us

1134
00:53:01,743 --> 00:53:04,137
and most importantly
on yourself,

1135
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:07,053
and to be honest, it's pathetic.

1136
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,098
You're only shutting
yourself down.

1137
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,275
You're a coward who's
afraid to really be honest

1138
00:53:11,362 --> 00:53:16,280
and that's what's going on
here, you selfish prick.

1139
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:17,933
- Go to hell Cole.

1140
00:53:19,326 --> 00:53:21,937
- Yeah, go ahead and walk out.

1141
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:25,550
- Nice job, Mr. Perfect.

1142
00:53:25,637 --> 00:53:26,942
The guy who hurt his leg

1143
00:53:27,029 --> 00:53:28,292
and took a few pills is suddenly

1144
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:30,685
a Saint who knows what's
best for everyone.

1145
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:31,338
- I didn't meet it that way.

1146
00:53:31,425 --> 00:53:32,339
- Yeah?

1147
00:53:32,426 --> 00:53:33,688
It sure came across like that.

1148
00:53:33,775 --> 00:53:34,602
- Look, I was only
trying to help.

1149
00:53:34,689 --> 00:53:36,648
- Your idea of help sucks.

1150
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:41,914
- Cole, I really think.

1151
00:53:42,001 --> 00:53:43,568
- No, not right now.

1152
00:53:48,877 --> 00:53:49,661
- Hi.

1153
00:53:53,926 --> 00:53:56,320
- I guess I make
Cole uncomfortable.

1154
00:53:56,407 --> 00:53:57,538
- Do you do it on purpose?

1155
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,322
- No.

1156
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:01,934
- Just comes naturally huh?

1157
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:03,022
- I suppose.

1158
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:09,942
- I'm sorry about what
happened in there.

1159
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:11,552
I have no idea.

1160
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,119
- It's all right.

1161
00:54:16,514 --> 00:54:19,778
I hated what he said, I
hated the way he said it.

1162
00:54:19,865 --> 00:54:22,346
I just hate the way
it makes me feel.

1163
00:54:22,433 --> 00:54:23,216
- How so?

1164
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:30,832
- In spite of the way he
came across, he was right.

1165
00:54:32,094 --> 00:54:33,661
I am afraid, Mollie.

1166
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:35,272
- Of what?

1167
00:54:40,233 --> 00:54:43,410
- Did you really
get pepper-sprayed
your freshman year?

1168
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:46,631
- Okay I was at a frat
party and I lost a bet.

1169
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,154
- What?

1170
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,721
What was the bet?

1171
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:53,246
- I had to choose between
getting pepper sprayed

1172
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:55,379
or taking off all my clothes
and jumping in the pool.

1173
00:54:55,466 --> 00:54:56,771
- Gosh.

1174
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,207
- I should have
jumped in the pool.

1175
00:54:58,295 --> 00:54:59,731
- Should have jumped
in the pool, yeah.

1176
00:54:59,818 --> 00:55:01,863
- Yeah, cause getting
pepper sprayed sucked.

1177
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:03,474
- [Richard] Oh yeah.

1178
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:22,406
- Hey, I thought
I'd find a here.

1179
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:29,195
You taking off?

1180
00:55:29,282 --> 00:55:30,675
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

1181
00:55:30,762 --> 00:55:34,156
I just wanted to get
away from everyone.

1182
00:55:34,243 --> 00:55:35,288
- Including me?

1183
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:41,686
Mollie was pretty harsh.

1184
00:55:43,905 --> 00:55:47,169
I'd like to say nice
things to your Cole.

1185
00:55:48,301 --> 00:55:50,347
Tell you she was out of line,

1186
00:55:51,826 --> 00:55:54,742
but that big speech
you gave in there,

1187
00:55:54,829 --> 00:55:56,222
you know about hanging in there

1188
00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:00,269
and being there for the
group and not giving up.

1189
00:56:01,793 --> 00:56:03,272
And yet you're in your truck.

1190
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,797
You're running away and
feeling sorry for yourself.

1191
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:08,974
- If that's what you
came here to say.

1192
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:10,932
- It's okay to not
be perfect, you know?

1193
00:56:11,019 --> 00:56:14,545
- I never thought of
myself as perfect.

1194
00:56:14,632 --> 00:56:17,809
- So what do you
think of yourself?

1195
00:56:17,896 --> 00:56:20,159
- I don't know, a guy who
had everything going for him

1196
00:56:20,246 --> 00:56:22,248
and then screwed it all up.

1197
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,642
- You thought you'd get through

1198
00:56:24,729 --> 00:56:25,991
life without making
any mistakes?

1199
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:28,167
- No, just not the
ones I've made.

1200
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:31,257
- We all make mistakes Cole.

1201
00:56:31,344 --> 00:56:33,128
You know, we agreed to all this.

1202
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,914
- Yeah, I know we agreed
to Fielding's email.

1203
00:56:36,001 --> 00:56:39,047
- No, I'm not talking
about Fielding.

1204
00:56:41,049 --> 00:56:41,833
Okay.

1205
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:45,880
- All right.

1206
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:52,539
- And look, about last night.

1207
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:53,714
- I'm sorry about that.

1208
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:54,498
I was a little.

1209
00:56:54,585 --> 00:56:55,890
- I'm not sure.

1210
00:56:57,588 --> 00:56:59,241
- You sure about that?

1211
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:00,112
- Yeah.

1212
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:10,209
And I know what really
happened in South Africa.

1213
00:57:22,264 --> 00:57:23,918
We can talk about it.

1214
00:57:32,231 --> 00:57:33,450
- Check it out, chopsticks.

1215
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:34,320
- Nice.

1216
00:57:37,018 --> 00:57:37,715
- Hey guys.

1217
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:38,498
- Hey.

1218
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:39,717
- All good?

1219
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:41,196
- [Mollie] Yeah.

1220
00:57:44,199 --> 00:57:45,331
- I'm not ready for this.

1221
00:57:45,418 --> 00:57:47,376
- Hey it's fine, it okay.

1222
00:57:48,856 --> 00:57:52,033
- Now is the winter
of out discontent.

1223
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:56,951
Richard the third,
act one, scene one.

1224
00:57:58,518 --> 00:57:59,911
- I think we're all
trying to figure out

1225
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:01,347
what we're doing here.

1226
00:58:01,434 --> 00:58:03,349
- Why we came here
in the first place.

1227
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:05,960
- Maybe that's not important.

1228
00:58:06,047 --> 00:58:08,659
Maybe we just need
to keep going.

1229
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,316
- Mollie, you met the
missionaries at a Starbucks.

1230
00:58:14,403 --> 00:58:16,623
- [Mollie] Waiting
for the rain to stop.

1231
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:19,496
- And when it stopped?

1232
00:58:19,583 --> 00:58:21,498
- We just kept talking,
before I knew it,

1233
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:23,630
I had a book of
Mormon in my hand

1234
00:58:23,717 --> 00:58:26,328
and I had missed my
Shakespeare class.

1235
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:26,981
- Wow.

1236
00:58:28,026 --> 00:58:29,331
- Had you ever heard of Mormons?

1237
00:58:29,418 --> 00:58:31,508
- Everybody's heard
of him Spielberg

1238
00:58:31,595 --> 00:58:33,466
but I had no idea
what they were about.

1239
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:37,122
I'd heard the usual stuff
like Utah, polygamy,

1240
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,517
something about
your Wonder Wear.

1241
00:58:40,604 --> 00:58:41,822
- My folks call them Gs.

1242
00:58:41,909 --> 00:58:42,693
- Garmies.

1243
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:43,520
Yeah.

1244
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:47,219
- So the missionaries
wanted to meet again

1245
00:58:47,306 --> 00:58:50,048
and I didn't think the
sidewalk was the best place.

1246
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:51,615
There was no way we
were going to my mom's.

1247
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:54,095
My dorm was out of the question.

1248
00:58:54,182 --> 00:58:57,838
So we decided to meet
where we met, Starbucks.

1249
00:58:59,492 --> 00:59:02,321
I guess you could say that's
where I became a Mormon.

1250
00:59:02,408 --> 00:59:04,062
- So you're a Mollie Mormon.

1251
00:59:04,149 --> 00:59:08,414
- Oh gee, Richard never
heard that one before.

1252
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:12,374
- I really don't think
she's a Mollie Mormon

1253
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:14,246
- And your parents
didn't like it?

1254
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,639
- Are you kidding?

1255
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,554
I mean, joining another
religions, one thing

1256
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:19,512
but I guess they
would have been fine

1257
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,210
if I was a Hindu, or
Buddhist, or something.

1258
00:59:22,297 --> 00:59:23,429
- Yeah.

1259
00:59:23,516 --> 00:59:25,605
- Yeah, we are pretty weird.

1260
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:28,782
- Yeah, my dad's a lawyer.

1261
00:59:30,479 --> 00:59:32,917
Felt like I was
being cross-examined.

1262
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:36,050
He started pulling all
that anti LDS stuff out.

1263
00:59:36,137 --> 00:59:37,791
Skeletons in the closet.

1264
00:59:37,878 --> 00:59:39,053
- Like what?

1265
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:40,533
- Oh, you name it.

1266
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,449
Polygamy, dead people
getting baptized,

1267
00:59:43,536 --> 00:59:45,146
blacks in the priesthood.

1268
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:48,497
Some stuff about Joseph
Smith, gay marriage.

1269
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,325
One of his favorites.

1270
00:59:50,412 --> 00:59:51,239
Got it all.

1271
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:54,939
- How did you deal
with all that?

1272
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:57,506
- Honestly, it was difficult.

1273
00:59:59,508 --> 01:00:00,814
The first I didn't believe it

1274
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:02,555
but then the missionaries

1275
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:05,036
told me that most
of it was true.

1276
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:06,864
- And that didn't
scare you away?

1277
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:08,213
- It did at first,

1278
01:00:09,736 --> 01:00:13,610
but I mean the missionaries
were great, patient.

1279
01:00:13,697 --> 01:00:18,179
They answered all my questions
and even called my dad.

1280
01:00:18,266 --> 01:00:19,616
- Really?

1281
01:00:19,703 --> 01:00:20,442
- How'd that go?

1282
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:21,530
- Not great.

1283
01:00:22,749 --> 01:00:24,577
I mean, it was okay.

1284
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:30,496
Look, there's lots of
weird stuff in the past,

1285
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:35,109
even stuff I don't understand
now, but I'm here ain't I?

1286
01:00:37,982 --> 01:00:38,678
- Yeah.

1287
01:00:40,288 --> 01:00:41,681
- That's beautiful.

1288
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:44,205
It's really great.

1289
01:00:44,292 --> 01:00:46,686
[all laughing]

1290
01:00:46,773 --> 01:00:48,296
- Okay, I had a few boyfriends.

1291
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:49,297
- [Spree] A few?

1292
01:00:49,384 --> 01:00:50,211
- [Miguel] How many is that?

1293
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:52,170
- A lady never tells.

1294
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:54,346
There might've been a
Red Sox in there though.

1295
01:00:54,433 --> 01:00:55,434
- Bet you were a
little heartbreaker.

1296
01:00:55,521 --> 01:00:57,958
- Speaking of heartbreaker.

1297
01:00:58,045 --> 01:01:00,787
Riley, you dumped that
fiance of yours or what?

1298
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:02,136
- Awkward.

1299
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:04,791
- Oh, I told you I
don't like to look back.

1300
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:08,708
- Sometimes we do stuff
we don't like, did you?

1301
01:01:10,101 --> 01:01:11,189
- I did.

1302
01:01:11,276 --> 01:01:12,451
- [Mollie] Why?

1303
01:01:12,538 --> 01:01:13,452
- He had issues.

1304
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:14,322
- Like?

1305
01:01:16,629 --> 01:01:17,935
- Okay it's one thing

1306
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:19,501
if we're talking
about us, ourselves,

1307
01:01:19,588 --> 01:01:20,589
when we start talking about
someone who's not here.

1308
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:21,939
- What issues?

1309
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:24,681
- Addiction issues.

1310
01:01:25,856 --> 01:01:26,813
- [Miguel] Like Cole?

1311
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,553
- No.

1312
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,510
- Dude.

1313
01:01:28,597 --> 01:01:30,034
- [Mollie] Addicted to what?

1314
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:31,949
- I'm guessing pornography.

1315
01:01:32,036 --> 01:01:35,866
- Was that it, was
he addicted to porn?

1316
01:01:35,953 --> 01:01:37,258
- Sort of.

1317
01:01:37,345 --> 01:01:39,565
- [Mollie] Sort of
addicted to porn?

1318
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:42,611
- Okay, fine, he was,
he was addicted to porn.

1319
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,482
- Addicted's a strong word.

1320
01:01:43,569 --> 01:01:45,484
- Okay, fine.

1321
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:49,096
Then let's just say he
was very preoccupied.

1322
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,968
Consumed, couldn't
get enough of it.

1323
01:01:51,055 --> 01:01:51,751
Is that better?

1324
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:52,883
- What kinds?

1325
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:56,147
I mean, I mean,
there's all kinds.

1326
01:01:56,234 --> 01:01:58,366
Like some guys think a girl
in a bikini is pornographic

1327
01:01:58,453 --> 01:02:01,326
and then it kind
of goes from there.

1328
01:02:01,413 --> 01:02:02,414
Like all kinds.

1329
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:03,807
- I don't know Mollie.

1330
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,243
It's not like I
watched it with him.

1331
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:06,157
- Did he want you to?

1332
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:07,419
- Were you mad at him?

1333
01:02:07,506 --> 01:02:09,029
- I was furious.

1334
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,552
Yeah, lost control.

1335
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:14,992
I punched him, screamed a lot.

1336
01:02:19,344 --> 01:02:22,303
I said things to
him I'd never said

1337
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:25,002
to anyone before
and then I cried

1338
01:02:30,616 --> 01:02:33,793
and he held me and
he said he was sorry.

1339
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,014
He said he wouldn't
do it anymore, so.

1340
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:41,670
- So who's hungry.

1341
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:43,934
- I mean, I can always eat.

1342
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:45,500
So that sounds great to me.

1343
01:02:45,587 --> 01:02:46,850
- Yeah, let's go.

1344
01:02:48,373 --> 01:02:51,332
- Opened a can of
worms on that one.

1345
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:56,120
- That was awkward.

1346
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,251
- Anyone else want
chips and salsa?

1347
01:02:57,338 --> 01:02:58,644
- Yes, me.

1348
01:02:58,731 --> 01:03:02,213
I would like some chips
and salsa, please.

1349
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,649
- Everyone wants
a sandwich, right?

1350
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:04,258
- Yeah.

1351
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:05,869
- Yes.

1352
01:03:05,956 --> 01:03:07,131
- Can you do a double
peanut butter on mine?

1353
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:09,698
- And light on the jelly for me.

1354
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,308
- Mollie.

1355
01:03:10,395 --> 01:03:11,657
- Yeah.

1356
01:03:11,744 --> 01:03:12,919
- Going from Irish
Catholic to LDS.

1357
01:03:13,006 --> 01:03:14,573
That's quite the journey.

1358
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:16,488
- Was it tough?

1359
01:03:16,575 --> 01:03:19,665
- What you think I didn't
have to clean up some?

1360
01:03:19,752 --> 01:03:21,754
Change a few habits.

1361
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:24,191
- You ever get lonely,
miss your family?

1362
01:03:24,278 --> 01:03:25,540
Or your friends?

1363
01:03:25,627 --> 01:03:27,238
- Yeah, I miss my friends.

1364
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:28,892
Some of them.

1365
01:03:28,979 --> 01:03:31,590
Beer at Fenway,
coffee at Starbucks.

1366
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:33,026
Some other things.

1367
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,638
When I first got to Utah

1368
01:03:36,725 --> 01:03:39,163
I think I cried myself to
sleep for about a week.

1369
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,382
Had some serious doubts.

1370
01:03:41,469 --> 01:03:42,427
- About?

1371
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:43,776
- Everything.

1372
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,560
- Did your parents
get remarried?

1373
01:03:45,647 --> 01:03:48,737
- My dad did and then
he moved to California.

1374
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,217
- Do you see him very much?

1375
01:03:50,304 --> 01:03:51,349
- Not really.

1376
01:03:51,436 --> 01:03:52,524
- Get along with
your stepmother?

1377
01:03:52,611 --> 01:03:54,134
- Are you kidding?

1378
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:56,571
She's practically my age and
looks like a Barbie doll.

1379
01:03:56,658 --> 01:03:57,572
- What do you call her?

1380
01:03:57,659 --> 01:03:58,660
- Barbie.

1381
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:01,794
- Do you get along
okay with your mom?

1382
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:04,275
- Can't say that I do.

1383
01:04:04,362 --> 01:04:06,712
- So you're pretty much alone.

1384
01:04:08,801 --> 01:04:09,846
- Yeah.

1385
01:04:11,456 --> 01:04:13,371
But hey, I got you
guys now, right?

1386
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:14,067
- That's for sure.

1387
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:14,938
- Of course.

1388
01:04:15,025 --> 01:04:16,069
- Yeah, you do now.

1389
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:17,505
- So my dad decided it was time

1390
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:19,943
for me to pay my
own way in life.

1391
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:21,596
I couldn't afford BC tuition.

1392
01:04:21,683 --> 01:04:23,729
So thought I'd come to Utah.

1393
01:04:23,816 --> 01:04:26,950
Really dig in deep
with the Mormons.

1394
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:27,820
- BYU?

1395
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:29,169
- Are you kidding?

1396
01:04:29,256 --> 01:04:31,084
I didn't want to
dig in that deep.

1397
01:04:31,171 --> 01:04:32,825
Let's do some food.

1398
01:04:32,912 --> 01:04:33,695
- Yes.

1399
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:38,613
- Almost forgot.

1400
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,527
The cookies.

1401
01:04:39,614 --> 01:04:40,398
- Yes.

1402
01:04:41,225 --> 01:04:42,574
- Dessert.

1403
01:04:42,661 --> 01:04:47,622
[people chattering]
[items clattering]

1404
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:53,672
- Richard, you ever
had a girlfriend?

1405
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,108
- You mean one of
my significance?

1406
01:04:55,195 --> 01:04:56,109
- Yeah.

1407
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,632
- Did you connect with her?

1408
01:04:57,719 --> 01:04:59,460
- Not in the way
you're thinking.

1409
01:04:59,547 --> 01:05:01,941
- Could you ever see
yourself getting married?

1410
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:02,986
- I don't know.

1411
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,335
I guess the real question

1412
01:05:04,422 --> 01:05:06,641
is could I see
someone marrying me?

1413
01:05:06,728 --> 01:05:08,730
- Why, you're amazing.

1414
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:09,731
- Whatever.

1415
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:17,043
- [Riley] Do you ever think
about being with a guy?

1416
01:05:27,967 --> 01:05:28,925
- Sometimes.

1417
01:05:31,710 --> 01:05:32,885
Do you mean, have I
ever been with a guy?

1418
01:05:32,972 --> 01:05:34,408
No, no I haven't.

1419
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,935
- [Mollie] But do
you think about it?

1420
01:05:39,022 --> 01:05:41,720
- I mean I think everyone wants

1421
01:05:43,809 --> 01:05:46,551
some kind of
connection, intimacy.

1422
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:53,906
Oh God, look, I like being
a member of the church.

1423
01:05:55,429 --> 01:05:57,910
I love going to the temple.

1424
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:59,346
I love the gospel.

1425
01:06:01,392 --> 01:06:05,178
I just don't know
how to do the gospel.

1426
01:06:05,265 --> 01:06:06,484
All of it.

1427
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:07,354
Yeah.

1428
01:06:08,486 --> 01:06:10,836
But I'm working on it.

1429
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:12,316
- Aren't we all?

1430
01:06:13,273 --> 01:06:14,013
- Yeah.

1431
01:06:15,449 --> 01:06:18,104
I want what you guys want.

1432
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:21,890
Family, someone I can
count on and trust,

1433
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,805
who I share my life with.

1434
01:06:27,113 --> 01:06:31,596
It's a pretty clear path for
you guys, not so much for me.

1435
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:35,600
- [Spree] I feel
that way sometimes.

1436
01:06:35,687 --> 01:06:36,949
- But you don't really have

1437
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,777
to change anything
about yourself.

1438
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:40,300
- We're all working on changing.

1439
01:06:40,387 --> 01:06:42,041
- It's different.

1440
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:45,218
Like, I either have to
change something about myself

1441
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,438
and don't even know what it is

1442
01:06:47,525 --> 01:06:51,703
or I have to come to grips
with who and what I am.

1443
01:06:54,793 --> 01:06:57,100
Somehow make the best of that.

1444
01:07:02,583 --> 01:07:05,325
- So are you
starting to trust us?

1445
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:10,722
- Yeah, I guess so.

1446
01:07:10,809 --> 01:07:11,853
- [Miguel] Why?

1447
01:07:13,464 --> 01:07:15,074
- I don't know.

1448
01:07:15,161 --> 01:07:19,339
- [Mollie] Spielberg, point
that camera at somebody else.

1449
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:21,863
- Oh dear.

1450
01:07:23,430 --> 01:07:26,390
[people chattering]

1451
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:29,741
- Hey Cole.

1452
01:07:29,828 --> 01:07:30,872
- [Cole] Yeah?

1453
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:32,787
- What happened with the drugs?

1454
01:07:32,874 --> 01:07:35,268
- Yeah, how'd you
get hooked on them?

1455
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,879
- The infection pain
got me hooked on them

1456
01:07:37,966 --> 01:07:40,404
and then I took it from there.

1457
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,234
Anyone here ever
had major surgery?

1458
01:07:44,321 --> 01:07:45,887
- I had my tonsils
out when I was five.

1459
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:48,325
- Shut up Spielberg.

1460
01:07:48,412 --> 01:07:48,890
- It hurt.

1461
01:07:50,414 --> 01:07:54,070
- Yeah well, I thought
sports were tough,

1462
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,245
but nothing compared
to a metal rod

1463
01:07:55,332 --> 01:07:57,725
and screws put in your leg.

1464
01:07:57,812 --> 01:07:59,988
- You still on painkillers?

1465
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,425
- No.

1466
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:03,818
- What kind of
stuff did you take?

1467
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:05,211
- You name it.

1468
01:08:05,298 --> 01:08:07,953
Percocet, Oxycontin,
Ativan, Vicodin.

1469
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:08,693
- Yikes.

1470
01:08:08,780 --> 01:08:09,694
- Yeah.

1471
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:11,174
The pills took away the pain,

1472
01:08:11,261 --> 01:08:16,004
and when pain went away,
I kept taking the pills.

1473
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:16,527
- Why?

1474
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,660
- Have you ever taken
pills Spielberg?

1475
01:08:19,747 --> 01:08:20,574
- [Miguel] Not like those.

1476
01:08:20,661 --> 01:08:22,010
- Well, if you ever do

1477
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,882
you'll know the answer
to that question.

1478
01:08:23,969 --> 01:08:26,102
- How much were you taking?

1479
01:08:26,189 --> 01:08:29,453
- I got up to about a
thousand milligrams a day.

1480
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:30,758
Sometimes more.

1481
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,412
- [Spree] That
sounds like a lot.

1482
01:08:32,499 --> 01:08:33,500
- It is.

1483
01:08:33,587 --> 01:08:34,501
- It's a lot.

1484
01:08:34,588 --> 01:08:36,155
- How'd you pay for it?

1485
01:08:36,242 --> 01:08:39,941
- Doctors, they just kept
prescribing this stuff to me.

1486
01:08:40,028 --> 01:08:42,074
And then, I mean, there were,

1487
01:08:42,161 --> 01:08:47,035
there were other times when I
had to get it in other ways.

1488
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:49,560
- [Richard] Did you ever
get into the heavier stuff?

1489
01:08:49,647 --> 01:08:51,127
- No, not really.

1490
01:08:52,867 --> 01:08:55,261
I finally told my parents
and I think they already knew

1491
01:08:55,348 --> 01:08:59,047
but yeah, that was
the turning point.

1492
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,920
- What'd they do,
were they upset?

1493
01:09:02,007 --> 01:09:05,706
- No, no, they just
hugged me, cried a lot.

1494
01:09:09,449 --> 01:09:10,668
- They were the ones who got me

1495
01:09:10,755 --> 01:09:13,236
into a rehab place
in New Mexico.

1496
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:16,239
- [Riley] Good parents.

1497
01:09:16,326 --> 01:09:17,631
- The best.

1498
01:09:17,718 --> 01:09:18,937
- [Mollie] How long
were you there?

1499
01:09:19,024 --> 01:09:20,765
- Six months.

1500
01:09:20,852 --> 01:09:23,071
Yeah and then I stayed on
to help around the place.

1501
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:24,943
Ended up working with
a few of the other guys

1502
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:27,946
cleaning horse stalls,
working in the kitchen.

1503
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:29,904
Did a lot of stargazing.

1504
01:09:31,297 --> 01:09:33,430
Yeah, I did that
for about a year.

1505
01:09:33,517 --> 01:09:34,735
- That's cool.

1506
01:09:34,822 --> 01:09:36,084
- That's quite a change.

1507
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:38,086
Mission field to rehab.

1508
01:09:39,566 --> 01:09:41,089
- How long have you been sober?

1509
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,004
- A little over two years now.

1510
01:09:43,091 --> 01:09:43,962
- Hey.

1511
01:09:44,049 --> 01:09:44,789
- Wow.

1512
01:09:44,876 --> 01:09:45,572
- That's major.

1513
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:46,312
- Way to go man.

1514
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:47,270
- Props.

1515
01:09:47,357 --> 01:09:49,141
- Do you still think about--

1516
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:50,795
- Every day.

1517
01:09:50,882 --> 01:09:53,711
- [Miguel] What do you do?

1518
01:09:53,798 --> 01:09:56,017
- Think about something else.

1519
01:09:56,104 --> 01:09:58,933
- [Richard] Do you ever sing
a primary song in your head?

1520
01:09:59,020 --> 01:09:59,760
- Yeah, I do.

1521
01:10:01,327 --> 01:10:04,417
My favorite is Popcorn
Popping On The Apricot Tree.

1522
01:10:04,504 --> 01:10:05,984
- A classic.

1523
01:10:06,071 --> 01:10:10,293
♪ I looked out the window
and what did I see ♪

1524
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:15,080
♪ Popcorn popping on
the apricot tree ♪

1525
01:10:18,126 --> 01:10:20,259
- What was the hardest part?

1526
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:28,180
- Not finishing my mission.

1527
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:30,313
I really loved South Africa.

1528
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,229
The work, the people.

1529
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,233
- The choices we make.

1530
01:10:38,321 --> 01:10:39,670
- Yeah, choices.

1531
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,853
I still need Brown pieces.

1532
01:10:50,202 --> 01:10:51,029
- Not having much luck.

1533
01:10:51,116 --> 01:10:52,248
- Like the dark root.

1534
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,032
- What shade?

1535
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:55,425
There's varying shades.

1536
01:10:55,512 --> 01:10:58,123
[all chattering]

1537
01:11:06,653 --> 01:11:09,134
[all humming]

1538
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:16,576
- So really Mollie, why'd
you join the church?

1539
01:11:16,663 --> 01:11:18,230
I mean it seems so
great in Boston.

1540
01:11:18,317 --> 01:11:20,580
You had a good life.

1541
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:22,582
- Well you know I love it.

1542
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:27,108
I mean, you guys all
grew up in the church.

1543
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:30,938
It's like this really
cool amusement park,

1544
01:11:31,025 --> 01:11:33,289
like Disney World times 10.

1545
01:11:35,552 --> 01:11:36,814
But I don't think
you guys see it.

1546
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:38,250
I mean, I don't even
think you all go

1547
01:11:38,337 --> 01:11:40,165
on all the rides, but me?

1548
01:11:42,559 --> 01:11:46,214
I was on the outside
and I said, I want in.

1549
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:48,478
So I got my ticket

1550
01:11:48,565 --> 01:11:51,872
and I started going
on all the rides.

1551
01:11:51,959 --> 01:11:53,570
And yeah, I don't know.

1552
01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:54,919
Maybe I'll go on a mission

1553
01:11:55,006 --> 01:11:57,487
and tell everybody I meet about

1554
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:58,879
this really cool amusement park.

1555
01:11:58,966 --> 01:12:00,446
- Go for it Mollie,
you'd be great.

1556
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:01,317
- Mollie, that's amazing.

1557
01:12:01,404 --> 01:12:02,318
- That'd be awesome.

1558
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:03,841
- Will you guys support me?

1559
01:12:03,928 --> 01:12:05,277
- Of course.

1560
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:07,279
- We'll send you a group
email every Monday.

1561
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:10,500
- With super cute pictures
of us having fun together.

1562
01:12:10,587 --> 01:12:11,414
- You guys.

1563
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:14,242
- All right Spielberg.

1564
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,680
Craziest thing you've ever done.

1565
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:17,898
- Oh wow.

1566
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:18,725
- Yeah.

1567
01:12:18,812 --> 01:12:19,552
- It is your turn.

1568
01:12:19,639 --> 01:12:21,075
- I don't know.

1569
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:22,947
- Come on, you had to
have done something.

1570
01:12:23,034 --> 01:12:24,731
- Come on dude.

1571
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:25,558
- Okay.

1572
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:28,648
- Oh here it is.

1573
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:31,347
- [Mollie] Just come on, dude.

1574
01:12:33,479 --> 01:12:35,133
- I'm so excited.

1575
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,613
- Oh gosh, okay.

1576
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,920
It was in high school and I.

1577
01:12:40,007 --> 01:12:42,270
[Miguel laughs]

1578
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:43,097
- Come on, man.

1579
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,144
- It was after a high
school football game

1580
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:48,886
and I mooned a
car full of girls.

1581
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,370
Yup, showed them my butt.

1582
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,200
- That's you're craziest thing?

1583
01:12:59,287 --> 01:13:00,680
- Nice Spielberg.

1584
01:13:01,725 --> 01:13:03,161
- Yeah.

1585
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:04,031
- Okay.

1586
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:10,603
- What do you see through that
camera of yours Spielberg?

1587
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,349
- I see some people
who have a bunch

1588
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,526
of stuff going on
in their lives.

1589
01:13:20,613 --> 01:13:23,224
- Yeah, but what's
going on in yours?

1590
01:13:23,311 --> 01:13:26,053
- Compared to you guys, nothing.

1591
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:27,794
- [Riley] Are you envious?

1592
01:13:27,881 --> 01:13:28,665
- No, I.

1593
01:13:32,233 --> 01:13:33,278
Confused.

1594
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:35,585
- About what?

1595
01:13:35,672 --> 01:13:38,892
- I mean, we all have
the gospel right?

1596
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:43,331
And yet we still
make stupid choices,

1597
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,377
and we do stupid things.

1598
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:47,118
- Yeah, so what's
your stupid stuff?

1599
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:49,337
- Aside from the mooning.

1600
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,557
- That's just it, I
don't have anything.

1601
01:13:51,644 --> 01:13:54,255
I've always been a good kid,

1602
01:13:54,342 --> 01:13:57,650
my dads a bishop, my mom
stays home with the kids,

1603
01:13:57,737 --> 01:13:59,043
I guess you guys just look

1604
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:01,132
at the gospel
differently than I do.

1605
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:02,002
- How so?

1606
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,877
- I like following
the rules you know,

1607
01:14:06,964 --> 01:14:09,532
I wanna go on a mission and
get married in the temple.

1608
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:11,359
Have kids, raise them right.

1609
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:12,709
- And we don't want that?

1610
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:14,275
- You saying I
wasn't raised right?

1611
01:14:14,362 --> 01:14:17,409
- No man, I just, well
I have a hard time,

1612
01:14:17,496 --> 01:14:21,065
I mean I really like
you guys but man,

1613
01:14:21,152 --> 01:14:22,327
some of the stuff
you've been through, I--

1614
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:23,894
- Your time will come man.

1615
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,199
It always does.

1616
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:27,854
- I guess.

1617
01:14:27,941 --> 01:14:31,292
- Maybe not, maybe
the destroying angel
will pass by him.

1618
01:14:31,379 --> 01:14:34,600
- I don't think so, no
you still have college,

1619
01:14:34,687 --> 01:14:37,516
mission, marriage, kids, career,

1620
01:14:37,603 --> 01:14:40,824
plenty of time to
screw it up Spielberg.

1621
01:14:40,911 --> 01:14:42,086
- Thanks Cole.

1622
01:14:44,349 --> 01:14:46,699
- Riley, how'd you find out?

1623
01:14:48,962 --> 01:14:50,268
About the porn.

1624
01:14:53,576 --> 01:14:57,493
- We were doing homework,
genealogy of all things.

1625
01:14:59,973 --> 01:15:02,323
And as we sat there at
the dinning room table

1626
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:05,718
of my parents home, no
less on a Sunday night,

1627
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:09,287
our laptops right
next to each other,

1628
01:15:09,374 --> 01:15:13,030
a website just popped
up on the computer.

1629
01:15:13,117 --> 01:15:14,422
He quickly closed
it, he knew I saw it

1630
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,251
and he didn't want
to talk about it.

1631
01:15:17,338 --> 01:15:18,949
My dad talked to us.

1632
01:15:19,036 --> 01:15:20,298
- Awkward.

1633
01:15:20,385 --> 01:15:21,952
- Well maybe it
wasn't a mistake,

1634
01:15:22,039 --> 01:15:25,390
maybe that was his way of
telling you he had a problem.

1635
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:27,827
- I don't know, I was confused.

1636
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:30,090
I couldn't figure out
how he found that,

1637
01:15:30,177 --> 01:15:32,266
I don't know, appealing.

1638
01:15:32,353 --> 01:15:34,791
- He didn't say anything even
after he knew you'd seen it?

1639
01:15:34,878 --> 01:15:37,358
- No, he pretty much shut down.

1640
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:40,100
I did too.

1641
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:42,712
I didn't know what to say.

1642
01:15:42,799 --> 01:15:45,541
I don't think guys understand
what that does to a girl.

1643
01:15:45,628 --> 01:15:46,498
- Amen.

1644
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:48,021
- You didn't see it coming?

1645
01:15:48,108 --> 01:15:50,284
- You didn't want to
try and make it work?

1646
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:51,764
- Yeah, we did, we did.

1647
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:53,113
I mean, we talked to his Bishop,

1648
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,552
a counselor and we
kept dating for awhile.

1649
01:15:58,336 --> 01:15:59,685
I don't know guys.

1650
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:03,820
I don't know how to put it.

1651
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:04,995
I felt rejected.

1652
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:08,302
You know, like he'd
been cheating on me.

1653
01:16:08,389 --> 01:16:10,000
- I totally get that.

1654
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:13,830
- And I thought,
am I not enough?

1655
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:20,532
You know, it really hit me hard.

1656
01:16:20,619 --> 01:16:22,490
Like how could he
choose pictures

1657
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:26,930
and videos of women he
didn't even know over me?

1658
01:16:27,017 --> 01:16:28,975
You know, I was right
there, I loved him.

1659
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:33,240
I was willing to give him
all of me, everything.

1660
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:37,418
Things I'd never given
to anyone, never would.

1661
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,246
You know, like, why
wasn't I enough?

1662
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,596
What was I missing?

1663
01:16:41,771 --> 01:16:44,512
- I don't see anything missing.

1664
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,384
- Thanks.

1665
01:16:48,778 --> 01:16:51,694
And I just kept wondering what

1666
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:54,522
he was thinking
when he kissed me,

1667
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:58,483
when he held me, when
he told me he loved me.

1668
01:16:59,876 --> 01:17:01,181
He just brushed it off.

1669
01:17:01,268 --> 01:17:02,748
Said a lot of guys were into it.

1670
01:17:02,835 --> 01:17:05,403
- I mean, not just guys,
there were some girls at BC.

1671
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:07,057
- He couldn't stop?

1672
01:17:07,144 --> 01:17:08,667
- Wouldn't.

1673
01:17:08,754 --> 01:17:12,192
Well, he tried, well,
at least he said he did.

1674
01:17:12,279 --> 01:17:13,629
- And you didn't want
to give him a chance?

1675
01:17:13,716 --> 01:17:17,328
- I gave him six
months of chances.

1676
01:17:17,415 --> 01:17:19,635
It was sort of a crisis for me.

1677
01:17:21,071 --> 01:17:24,596
Doubting myself, I'd
never done that before.

1678
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:27,555
I thought about
how I could change,

1679
01:17:28,905 --> 01:17:31,081
compete with the computer.

1680
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:34,258
- What did you do?

1681
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,527
- Oh gosh, it's so stupid.

1682
01:17:46,052 --> 01:17:47,793
I sent him some snaps.

1683
01:17:52,972 --> 01:17:54,408
You know, one of those
things that you do

1684
01:17:54,495 --> 01:17:58,064
and you feel like a
complete idiot afterwards.

1685
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,546
- What kind of snaps?

1686
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,114
- Snaps.

1687
01:18:06,507 --> 01:18:08,074
- So he gave you up for porn.

1688
01:18:08,161 --> 01:18:12,470
- Oh God, he gave up a
lot more than just me.

1689
01:18:12,557 --> 01:18:14,080
You know, I was ready.

1690
01:18:15,603 --> 01:18:17,649
You know what every
little girl dreams about?

1691
01:18:17,736 --> 01:18:21,566
Get married in the temple,
have a family, kids.

1692
01:18:23,002 --> 01:18:24,047
Him serving in the Bishop rig,

1693
01:18:24,134 --> 01:18:26,092
me teaching the young women.

1694
01:18:27,746 --> 01:18:31,532
Featured story in LDS living,
happily forever after.

1695
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:35,928
I was ready.

1696
01:18:37,495 --> 01:18:41,629
- The course of true love,
never did run smooth.

1697
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:43,501
- Can always count
on your Mollie.

1698
01:18:43,588 --> 01:18:45,416
- It's in my nature.

1699
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:51,291
- You know, besides that
somehow he'd changed.

1700
01:18:51,378 --> 01:18:52,640
You know, he didn't
want to talk about it,

1701
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,730
and that drove me crazy,

1702
01:18:54,817 --> 01:18:57,950
I can't be with
someone who won't talk.

1703
01:18:59,169 --> 01:19:01,432
And I said, I'll go to mission.

1704
01:19:02,999 --> 01:19:07,046
You know, I need some space
and he said, go ahead.

1705
01:19:10,789 --> 01:19:14,445
And after I got back from
my mission, he moved on.

1706
01:19:14,532 --> 01:19:18,666
Found a girl he was
crazy about and she him,

1707
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:23,062
they got married in the
temple about a year ago.

1708
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:24,542
- [Mollie] How'd
that make you feel?

1709
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:25,761
- Good, good.

1710
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:31,418
Yeah, he was the love
of my youth, you know

1711
01:19:31,505 --> 01:19:34,030
but after my mission, I--

1712
01:19:34,117 --> 01:19:35,292
- Were you mad at him?

1713
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:36,902
- No, no not at all.

1714
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:41,080
I grew up a lot in Brazil

1715
01:19:41,994 --> 01:19:43,474
and looking back,

1716
01:19:43,561 --> 01:19:46,651
I didn't handle the whole
situation very well.

1717
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:50,916
I was only 19

1718
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:55,573
and my mission, I don't know,

1719
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:58,315
I saw a lot of people go through

1720
01:19:58,402 --> 01:20:00,665
a lot of crap in their lives.

1721
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:05,801
And I saw the hand of God
work a lot of miracles.

1722
01:20:05,888 --> 01:20:09,413
- Did he work a miracle
with the love of your youth?

1723
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:10,980
- I don't know.

1724
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:11,589
I hope so.

1725
01:20:13,286 --> 01:20:17,203
- Well, I think you're beautiful
inside and out for sure.

1726
01:20:18,683 --> 01:20:22,600
- Okay, so what happened
to this gorgeous ring?

1727
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,385
- I gave it back.

1728
01:20:25,472 --> 01:20:26,865
- I'd have kept it.

1729
01:20:28,040 --> 01:20:29,433
What?

1730
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,304
That's like a whole
semester of tuition.

1731
01:20:31,391 --> 01:20:32,175
- Oh shoot.

1732
01:20:32,262 --> 01:20:33,002
- Yeah.

1733
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:44,143
- Yeah, I went to Colorado
to have my baby, my son.

1734
01:20:46,319 --> 01:20:48,060
- Did you go to school there?

1735
01:20:48,147 --> 01:20:49,801
- Yeah.

1736
01:20:49,888 --> 01:20:52,064
- That must've been weird,
being pregnant in school.

1737
01:20:52,151 --> 01:20:53,631
- It was.

1738
01:20:53,718 --> 01:20:55,807
I didn't talk to anybody.

1739
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,461
Nobody talked to me.

1740
01:20:57,548 --> 01:20:59,724
I was fine with that.

1741
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:03,771
I didn't make any friends,
I didn't really want to.

1742
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,904
- You were staying with
your grandparents, right?

1743
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:09,690
- Uh huh, my grandparents
were very cool.

1744
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:10,778
Very loving.

1745
01:21:13,259 --> 01:21:16,784
By the time I was
ready to have my baby

1746
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:21,441
my dad had arranged with a
dentist back home to adopt him.

1747
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:26,359
- But I thought your
mom was raising him?

1748
01:21:27,273 --> 01:21:28,884
- Yeah, no, sorry.

1749
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:38,023
Me and her wanted to,
but my dad said no.

1750
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:39,633
- I don't know if
I could do that.

1751
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:41,113
Just give up my baby.

1752
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,725
- I hope you never have
to make that choice.

1753
01:21:51,819 --> 01:21:53,125
After I had my son

1754
01:21:55,780 --> 01:22:00,045
I was still laying there and
they were cleaning me up.

1755
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:03,831
It was pretty messy.

1756
01:22:05,224 --> 01:22:07,966
And my baby was
lying on my tummy.

1757
01:22:11,274 --> 01:22:13,929
He was covered in
blood, my blood

1758
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:22,676
and I looked at him and
his eyes were closed.

1759
01:22:30,293 --> 01:22:31,859
He never even saw me

1760
01:22:36,386 --> 01:22:38,692
and then they cut the cord.

1761
01:22:41,043 --> 01:22:42,958
- What happened then?

1762
01:22:45,786 --> 01:22:47,440
- The nurse took him.

1763
01:22:50,835 --> 01:22:52,968
It's weird, for most mothers

1764
01:22:56,406 --> 01:23:00,888
that moment is the beginning
of a life, of a relationship

1765
01:23:04,675 --> 01:23:07,199
that's supposed to last forever.

1766
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:12,988
And for me, that was the end.

1767
01:23:17,601 --> 01:23:18,428
- So sorry.

1768
01:23:20,256 --> 01:23:23,607
- You know when you're
15 and having a baby,

1769
01:23:24,564 --> 01:23:25,826
the hospital treats you

1770
01:23:25,913 --> 01:23:29,656
like you are this
slutty little teenager.

1771
01:23:29,743 --> 01:23:32,616
They have no idea
how scared you are.

1772
01:23:32,703 --> 01:23:37,099
The lights, the pain,
everybody looking at you

1773
01:23:37,186 --> 01:23:38,883
and poking your body.

1774
01:23:42,887 --> 01:23:43,975
There was one nurse
who was really nice,

1775
01:23:44,062 --> 01:23:46,586
but you know, maybe it wasn't

1776
01:23:49,937 --> 01:23:53,071
the hospital that
made me feel slutty.

1777
01:23:56,944 --> 01:24:01,732
Anyway, your body
keeps reminding you
that you had a baby

1778
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,563
even though there is no baby.

1779
01:24:09,087 --> 01:24:13,700
Your hormones are going
crazy, your boobs get huge.

1780
01:24:13,787 --> 01:24:17,008
Hard to imagine, I
know, but they do,

1781
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:20,055
they get huge and
it's super painful

1782
01:24:20,142 --> 01:24:23,884
until even they realized
that there's no baby.

1783
01:24:28,019 --> 01:24:31,979
- Looking back are you
angry about the adoption?

1784
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:36,114
- My dad's a good guy.

1785
01:24:36,201 --> 01:24:38,073
He is and I love him.

1786
01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:43,556
But I think that when I
told him I was pregnant

1787
01:24:45,167 --> 01:24:48,953
it was really hard for
him to deal with that.

1788
01:24:50,433 --> 01:24:52,174
Do I sometimes wonder
what it would have been

1789
01:24:52,261 --> 01:24:54,872
like to raise him with my mom?

1790
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:56,874
Yeah.

1791
01:24:56,961 --> 01:24:59,485
- And he's with the dentist now?

1792
01:24:59,572 --> 01:25:00,269
- Yeah.

1793
01:25:01,835 --> 01:25:03,315
- Do you ever see him?

1794
01:25:03,402 --> 01:25:04,447
- Not really.

1795
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:09,843
Kinda, I mean the mother,
the dentist's wife,

1796
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:11,758
she takes him out, you know,

1797
01:25:11,845 --> 01:25:15,284
to the grocery store,
doing the mom kid thing.

1798
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:16,676
A burger joint.

1799
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,420
Like I said, it's a small town.

1800
01:25:22,987 --> 01:25:26,121
- Seeing your own
kid with another mom.

1801
01:25:27,948 --> 01:25:28,732
- Yeah.

1802
01:25:30,255 --> 01:25:33,128
And then there's the
dad, the dentist.

1803
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:35,913
He's got these
billboards all over town.

1804
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,610
With these big pictures of him

1805
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:39,525
and the whole family,
all five of them.

1806
01:25:39,612 --> 01:25:42,006
They've adopted a
couple other kids.

1807
01:25:42,093 --> 01:25:44,661
It's like, who goes to a dentist

1808
01:25:44,748 --> 01:25:46,793
just because you've
got kids, you know,

1809
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:48,230
it makes no sense.

1810
01:25:51,058 --> 01:25:54,149
Anyway so, I see him, I see him,

1811
01:25:54,236 --> 01:25:56,020
but he doesn't see me.

1812
01:26:00,024 --> 01:26:02,679
He doesn't even
know that I exist.

1813
01:26:05,203 --> 01:26:07,814
I'm not allowed to contact him.

1814
01:26:07,901 --> 01:26:10,904
- Does anybody back home
know you had a baby?

1815
01:26:10,991 --> 01:26:12,732
Your friends, anybody.

1816
01:26:15,605 --> 01:26:16,997
- Just you guys.

1817
01:26:17,955 --> 01:26:19,304
- And your family?

1818
01:26:20,653 --> 01:26:21,915
- Just my parents.

1819
01:26:23,482 --> 01:26:27,051
They didn't want my brother
and sisters to know.

1820
01:26:29,532 --> 01:26:32,361
But I'm going to
tell them someday.

1821
01:26:35,146 --> 01:26:37,148
I have a picture of him.

1822
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:42,153
It's about a year old.

1823
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:44,677
I got it from the
dentist website.

1824
01:26:44,764 --> 01:26:45,939
- [Miguel] How old is he now?

1825
01:26:46,026 --> 01:26:48,333
- [Spree] He's four.

1826
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:50,030
- [Cole] Do you know his name?

1827
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:54,905
- [Spree] Adam, heard his
mom called him that once.

1828
01:26:54,992 --> 01:26:56,123
- Did you give him a name?

1829
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:57,299
- No.

1830
01:26:57,386 --> 01:26:59,170
No, I didn't want to do that.

1831
01:26:59,257 --> 01:27:01,172
- Do you ever hope
that when you're

1832
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:04,131
out shopping or something
that you'll ran into him?

1833
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:05,698
- Yeah.

1834
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:09,224
- Do you ever wish the
whole thing never happened?

1835
01:27:10,399 --> 01:27:13,228
- It's hard knowing that there's

1836
01:27:16,274 --> 01:27:19,799
a part of me out there
that I can't be with.

1837
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:23,499
Communicate with.

1838
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:30,245
- Spree, you are
Adam's mother, you are.

1839
01:27:32,682 --> 01:27:37,382
And at some point maybe,
maybe not in this life,

1840
01:27:37,469 --> 01:27:42,082
but at some point, I believe
you will be a mother to him.

1841
01:27:43,432 --> 01:27:45,085
Maybe not the mother.

1842
01:27:46,957 --> 01:27:48,698
- He already has
that in someone else.

1843
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:51,222
- [Mollie] Right, but a mother.

1844
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:55,444
- I hope you're right.

1845
01:27:55,531 --> 01:27:58,098
[gentle music]

1846
01:28:05,192 --> 01:28:08,326
So Richard, since
you wanted an answer

1847
01:28:10,676 --> 01:28:13,897
to your question,
me, I'm not a virgin.

1848
01:28:18,641 --> 01:28:21,121
[gentle music]

1849
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:32,263
- Growing up, all I wanted
to do was serve a mission.

1850
01:28:32,350 --> 01:28:35,614
One of the best days of my
life was when I got my call.

1851
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:38,878
- So what about the
whole intimacy thing?

1852
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,142
- I've heard people
say, you know,

1853
01:28:42,229 --> 01:28:44,101
when this topic comes
up in Sunday school

1854
01:28:44,188 --> 01:28:46,756
or priesthood meeting,
something like that.

1855
01:28:46,843 --> 01:28:49,759
I've heard people
say, well you know,

1856
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:51,978
people with same sex attraction,

1857
01:28:52,065 --> 01:28:54,329
if that's what you call it,

1858
01:28:54,416 --> 01:28:56,200
they just have to play by the
same rules as everyone else

1859
01:28:56,287 --> 01:28:58,463
and everything will be cool.

1860
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:00,291
- Yeah, I've heard that before.

1861
01:29:00,378 --> 01:29:02,119
- But that's not true

1862
01:29:02,206 --> 01:29:06,079
because they see it in very
simple black and white terms.

1863
01:29:06,166 --> 01:29:08,647
You just have to,
you just, well,

1864
01:29:10,127 --> 01:29:12,172
they think that
it's all about sex.

1865
01:29:12,259 --> 01:29:14,349
You just can't have sex.

1866
01:29:14,436 --> 01:29:17,352
And I mean, yeah,
that's part of it,

1867
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:18,701
but that's not the
real issue here

1868
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:20,267
when you think about it.

1869
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:21,660
At least not for me,

1870
01:29:21,747 --> 01:29:25,185
because what they
say to you guys is

1871
01:29:25,272 --> 01:29:28,232
right, hey, just kind
of behave yourself

1872
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:31,322
until you get married and
then boom, no holds bar,

1873
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:33,890
the rules don't apply anymore.

1874
01:29:33,977 --> 01:29:35,718
For me they're really saying

1875
01:29:35,805 --> 01:29:38,329
that I'll never have
any intimacy at all.

1876
01:29:38,416 --> 01:29:40,070
You know, no one to go home to,

1877
01:29:40,157 --> 01:29:41,985
no one to, just no one.

1878
01:29:45,597 --> 01:29:48,774
And then there's the
M word, marriage.

1879
01:29:48,861 --> 01:29:50,036
That word frightens me.

1880
01:29:50,123 --> 01:29:51,951
- I feel the same way.

1881
01:29:52,038 --> 01:29:53,562
- And it's something
I want in some way

1882
01:29:53,649 --> 01:29:57,653
but it's something I'll
probably never have.

1883
01:29:57,740 --> 01:30:01,178
And you guys, I mean,
understandably, I get it.

1884
01:30:01,265 --> 01:30:03,223
You look forward to that.

1885
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:04,964
You can see it in
your near future.

1886
01:30:05,051 --> 01:30:07,402
- Hopefully not the near future.

1887
01:30:07,489 --> 01:30:10,187
- But you can see
getting married

1888
01:30:10,274 --> 01:30:13,582
and having kids,
raising a family,

1889
01:30:13,669 --> 01:30:16,889
you know doing everything
you're supposed to.

1890
01:30:16,976 --> 01:30:21,677
And from where I am right
now, I can't really see that.

1891
01:30:22,591 --> 01:30:23,374
- What do you see?

1892
01:30:24,767 --> 01:30:27,030
- I see people
telling me, Richard,

1893
01:30:27,117 --> 01:30:28,423
you're fine the way you are.

1894
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:29,772
And you know, you
have these feelings

1895
01:30:29,859 --> 01:30:31,469
and you just have
to control that.

1896
01:30:31,556 --> 01:30:34,516
And if you do that and you'll
be fine, it's not a problem.

1897
01:30:34,603 --> 01:30:35,908
- It is a problem.

1898
01:30:35,995 --> 01:30:37,170
- Yeah, it is.

1899
01:30:39,869 --> 01:30:40,565
You guys.

1900
01:30:42,045 --> 01:30:45,396
I mean, you go on a
date and you hold hands.

1901
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:47,093
You make out a little
at the end of the night,

1902
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:48,094
you know, it's no big deal.

1903
01:30:48,181 --> 01:30:49,531
Everything's cool.

1904
01:30:49,618 --> 01:30:52,055
You say good night,
maybe another kiss.

1905
01:30:52,142 --> 01:30:54,318
You had a great time.

1906
01:30:54,405 --> 01:30:56,886
There's some energy
going through your body.

1907
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:58,365
When you hold hands

1908
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:01,107
or when you kiss your
boyfriend or girlfriend,

1909
01:31:01,194 --> 01:31:05,024
the electricity fireworks,
I've never had that.

1910
01:31:06,417 --> 01:31:08,071
- Do you want to?

1911
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:09,768
- I don't know.

1912
01:31:09,855 --> 01:31:12,597
Sometimes I just don't
feel very normal.

1913
01:31:12,684 --> 01:31:14,860
- Who wants to be normal?

1914
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:17,950
- I do, sometimes.

1915
01:31:20,823 --> 01:31:22,259
But then on the other
hand, I think, you know

1916
01:31:22,346 --> 01:31:24,435
so what's so abnormal about me?

1917
01:31:24,522 --> 01:31:27,394
Did I do something
wrong or am I a mistake?

1918
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:31,268
Is this something God
gave to me on purpose

1919
01:31:31,355 --> 01:31:34,010
or it's just something
I have to deal with?

1920
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:36,534
Yeah, did my DNA
get all screwed up?

1921
01:31:36,621 --> 01:31:38,536
I've heard that one.

1922
01:31:38,623 --> 01:31:40,059
You know, am I really
supposed to say

1923
01:31:40,146 --> 01:31:42,192
for the rest of my life

1924
01:31:42,279 --> 01:31:43,933
I'm not going to have
any real companionship

1925
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:48,720
except for friends and social
acquaintances and activities.

1926
01:31:49,678 --> 01:31:51,244
- Yeah, that sucks.

1927
01:31:51,331 --> 01:31:52,985
- Yeah it does.

1928
01:31:53,072 --> 01:31:54,117
Oh, big time.

1929
01:31:56,206 --> 01:31:59,470
And then at church,
all these girls,

1930
01:31:59,557 --> 01:32:04,040
women come up to me, they tell
me all about their love life.

1931
01:32:04,127 --> 01:32:05,607
How excited they
are to get married.

1932
01:32:05,694 --> 01:32:08,958
And then they show up
with their husbands.

1933
01:32:10,481 --> 01:32:14,485
And I'm just, just me
sitting there by myself.

1934
01:32:16,705 --> 01:32:20,056
And I mean, I don't know if
it would ever come to this

1935
01:32:20,143 --> 01:32:24,887
but let's say I was, I
don't know what you call it,

1936
01:32:24,974 --> 01:32:27,280
but in a relationship with,

1937
01:32:30,457 --> 01:32:33,548
sounds so weird to
say this, with a guy.

1938
01:32:35,680 --> 01:32:37,769
I mean, we couldn't
go to church.

1939
01:32:37,856 --> 01:32:39,510
There's no way

1940
01:32:39,597 --> 01:32:42,731
- I'll go to church
with you, Richard.

1941
01:32:43,601 --> 01:32:45,298
- Thanks Mollie.

1942
01:32:45,385 --> 01:32:48,345
- That doesn't
really help, does it?

1943
01:32:50,695 --> 01:32:52,871
- But then there's family.

1944
01:32:56,440 --> 01:32:58,660
I'll probably never be a dad.

1945
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,404
Never see my child born, never
play catch in the backyard

1946
01:33:04,491 --> 01:33:09,105
or things like that or teach
them about God, Christ,

1947
01:33:10,672 --> 01:33:13,196
and the gospel, these
things that I love.

1948
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,595
- Wow.

1949
01:33:22,379 --> 01:33:25,817
- I can't see clearly
past this life.

1950
01:33:25,904 --> 01:33:28,733
Cause I get it, I
do, I really get it.

1951
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:30,779
That in God's mind,
and his world,

1952
01:33:30,866 --> 01:33:35,697
and his universe, the next
life is a man and a woman.

1953
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:37,263
I believe that.

1954
01:33:38,482 --> 01:33:40,440
But how do I do that?

1955
01:33:40,527 --> 01:33:41,833
- What about your parents?

1956
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:43,400
Have you tried--

1957
01:33:43,487 --> 01:33:45,358
- No, I haven't said
anything to them.

1958
01:33:45,445 --> 01:33:47,056
- Do they have any idea?

1959
01:33:47,143 --> 01:33:50,407
- Probably, I just
never talk about it.

1960
01:33:52,452 --> 01:33:53,976
I mean, they love me but.

1961
01:33:54,063 --> 01:33:56,761
- Do you think that
would change if you?

1962
01:33:56,848 --> 01:33:58,110
- I don't know.

1963
01:33:59,111 --> 01:34:00,852
- I don't think it would.

1964
01:34:02,245 --> 01:34:04,551
- [Cole] Any
brothers or sisters?

1965
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,771
- Four yeah, I'm the oldest.

1966
01:34:08,686 --> 01:34:12,385
Their hero, knight
in shining armor.

1967
01:34:12,472 --> 01:34:14,300
They all look up to me.

1968
01:34:15,606 --> 01:34:18,478
- Doubt thou the stars are fire,

1969
01:34:18,565 --> 01:34:20,959
doubt that the sun does move,

1970
01:34:21,046 --> 01:34:25,616
doubt truth to be a liar,
but never doubt I love thee.

1971
01:34:27,618 --> 01:34:29,751
Hamlet, act two, scene two.

1972
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:34,625
- Thanks guys.

1973
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:39,412
But not much can be said.

1974
01:34:39,499 --> 01:34:41,458
It's just, it's
something the church

1975
01:34:41,545 --> 01:34:45,331
doesn't really have an
answer for right now.

1976
01:34:45,418 --> 01:34:49,727
I'm just stuck in the middle
of this forbidden ground.

1977
01:34:53,209 --> 01:34:55,864
But I really appreciate you
guys talking to me about it.

1978
01:34:55,951 --> 01:34:57,561
- You're the best.

1979
01:34:57,648 --> 01:34:59,563
- We love you.

1980
01:34:59,650 --> 01:35:01,608
- Yeah, we're here anytime.

1981
01:35:04,176 --> 01:35:05,308
- That's what I'm saying.

1982
01:35:05,395 --> 01:35:06,788
[all chattering]

1983
01:35:06,875 --> 01:35:09,138
- Oh ladies, there you are.

1984
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:13,229
- So Spielberg.

1985
01:35:13,316 --> 01:35:14,883
- Yeah.

1986
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:18,625
- You've seen a lot through
that camera this weekend.

1987
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:21,803
- Yeah, you know it's
kind of weird knowing

1988
01:35:21,890 --> 01:35:24,022
all this stuff about you guys.

1989
01:35:24,109 --> 01:35:25,937
I mean I only met you yesterday.

1990
01:35:26,024 --> 01:35:27,547
I didn't even know you.

1991
01:35:27,634 --> 01:35:29,680
And then you started talking
about all these things

1992
01:35:29,767 --> 01:35:32,204
and well, I thought
you were sort of weird.

1993
01:35:32,291 --> 01:35:33,118
Strange.

1994
01:35:33,205 --> 01:35:34,641
- That's not better.

1995
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,252
- We think you're the
weird one Spielberg.

1996
01:35:36,339 --> 01:35:37,732
- Yeah.

1997
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:38,558
- I'm beginning to
think you're right.

1998
01:35:38,645 --> 01:35:39,995
- You're awesome.

1999
01:35:41,823 --> 01:35:46,436
- I know I say dumb stuff and
sometimes I just don't get it

2000
01:35:48,046 --> 01:35:49,569
and Mollie, the Shakespeare
guy is way over my head

2001
01:35:49,656 --> 01:35:51,615
but I love you guys.

2002
01:35:57,534 --> 01:35:58,970
- Hey, you're okay.

2003
01:35:59,971 --> 01:36:01,494
- Come here.

2004
01:36:01,581 --> 01:36:03,888
- So where do we go from here?

2005
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:09,154
- I think it all just comes
down to what we believe.

2006
01:36:09,241 --> 01:36:11,722
- Yeah, what do we believe?

2007
01:36:11,809 --> 01:36:13,550
- All right, yeah.

2008
01:36:13,637 --> 01:36:16,161
Yeah, let's go with that.

2009
01:36:16,248 --> 01:36:18,207
What are our core beliefs?

2010
01:36:18,294 --> 01:36:20,644
I mean, who are we really?

2011
01:36:20,731 --> 01:36:24,256
- Yeah or how do we
know God loves us?

2012
01:36:24,343 --> 01:36:26,911
Or how do I know God loves me?

2013
01:36:26,998 --> 01:36:28,608
- He loves us.

2014
01:36:28,695 --> 01:36:30,654
- Right, yeah, I
guess I know that

2015
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:33,526
on one level, intellectually.

2016
01:36:33,613 --> 01:36:35,659
And that's a great
for the big picture.

2017
01:36:35,746 --> 01:36:37,966
- But how about
the little picture.

2018
01:36:38,053 --> 01:36:38,575
- Right.

2019
01:36:40,055 --> 01:36:43,754
How do I know God has
a place for me, a plan?

2020
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:46,191
Or does he have a plan for me?

2021
01:36:47,627 --> 01:36:48,324
- I think he does.

2022
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:49,804
- Absolutely.

2023
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:54,069
- Okay then is my plan
different from your plan?

2024
01:36:54,156 --> 01:36:56,462
You know, is God's
plan of happiness

2025
01:36:56,549 --> 01:36:59,117
an individual plan
for each person,

2026
01:36:59,204 --> 01:37:03,034
or this one big happy
plan that we all buy into?

2027
01:37:05,863 --> 01:37:07,517
One size fits all.

2028
01:37:07,604 --> 01:37:11,651
- Heavenly father has
a plan for you Richard.

2029
01:37:11,738 --> 01:37:15,699
- I think it comes down
to do we believe Christ?

2030
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:20,443
I mean, do we
really believe him?

2031
01:37:20,530 --> 01:37:21,792
- I believe in him.

2032
01:37:21,879 --> 01:37:23,446
- No, that's not what I mean.

2033
01:37:23,533 --> 01:37:27,711
I mean, do we believe him,
that he is who he says he is?

2034
01:37:28,755 --> 01:37:30,279
Can do what he says he can do.

2035
01:37:30,366 --> 01:37:34,849
- I believe, I mean, we
gotta, we have to figure out.

2036
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:37,590
The atonement, right?

2037
01:37:37,677 --> 01:37:40,202
That's the core, that one event.

2038
01:37:44,249 --> 01:37:48,384
And I don't know what
other words to use for it,

2039
01:37:48,471 --> 01:37:51,735
event or happening,
but that one event,

2040
01:37:53,084 --> 01:37:55,695
if some how, I don't know how,

2041
01:37:57,175 --> 01:37:58,742
I don't think anyone does,

2042
01:37:58,829 --> 01:38:01,788
but if we let him,
if we believe him,

2043
01:38:07,316 --> 01:38:09,144
he can fix all of this.

2044
01:38:10,754 --> 01:38:12,712
- So you're saying
I need to be fixed?

2045
01:38:12,799 --> 01:38:16,368
- No, Richard, you
don't need to be fixed.

2046
01:38:17,587 --> 01:38:19,894
What I mean is whatever issues

2047
01:38:22,070 --> 01:38:24,724
we're going through,
that he can.

2048
01:38:26,204 --> 01:38:27,597
- Give us peace.

2049
01:38:29,468 --> 01:38:31,862
- He is the Prince of Peace.

2050
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:37,912
- Wasn't really honest
with you guys earlier.

2051
01:38:37,999 --> 01:38:42,742
My not finishing my mission
being the hardest part.

2052
01:38:42,829 --> 01:38:45,006
When I got into my
accident, got banged up,

2053
01:38:45,093 --> 01:38:48,661
and hooked on painkillers
is pretty horrible,

2054
01:38:50,359 --> 01:38:54,493
but Spielberg, he asked me
why I kept taking the pills.

2055
01:38:54,580 --> 01:38:56,582
- Yeah, I remember.

2056
01:38:56,669 --> 01:39:00,064
- I didn't really answer
that very honestly.

2057
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:03,415
I didn't really answer
it at all, actually.

2058
01:39:04,634 --> 01:39:06,984
So the pills took away the pain

2059
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:11,510
or at least made me forget it.

2060
01:39:17,168 --> 01:39:20,867
The accident happened
because I looked away

2061
01:39:20,955 --> 01:39:24,175
and I looked away
because my companion,

2062
01:39:29,267 --> 01:39:33,793
my companion was this kid
from a little town in Idaho.

2063
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:36,971
Eden, Idaho sounds
perfect, doesn't it?

2064
01:39:37,058 --> 01:39:38,450
- Yeah.

2065
01:39:38,537 --> 01:39:41,671
- He was so excited
to be a missionary.

2066
01:39:45,762 --> 01:39:48,939
Here's this kid,
this 18 year old kid.

2067
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:56,033
He's funny and smart, he had
a cute girlfriend back home.

2068
01:39:57,034 --> 01:39:58,122
Great family.

2069
01:40:01,212 --> 01:40:04,824
And then we were, just
driving down the road.

2070
01:40:05,825 --> 01:40:07,218
He told me a joke.

2071
01:40:07,305 --> 01:40:10,439
Like I said, he was,
he was a funny kid.

2072
01:40:11,962 --> 01:40:15,400
I laugh and I look over
to him, he's laughing.

2073
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:24,844
And that's the last
sound he ever made.

2074
01:40:28,065 --> 01:40:30,372
I didn't see the red light.

2075
01:40:34,463 --> 01:40:38,032
I've never been able to
forgive myself for that.

2076
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:39,555
- Accidents happen.

2077
01:40:39,642 --> 01:40:41,861
- I'm well aware of that Mollie.

2078
01:40:41,948 --> 01:40:45,126
- It really wasn't
your fault Cole.

2079
01:40:45,213 --> 01:40:46,910
- Actually, it was.

2080
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:57,181
When I was in the
hospital in Salt Lake

2081
01:40:58,487 --> 01:41:00,619
I couldn't go to his funeral.

2082
01:41:02,143 --> 01:41:05,015
Two days after the
funeral his parents,

2083
01:41:05,102 --> 01:41:09,019
brother and sister
Green came to visit me.

2084
01:41:09,106 --> 01:41:10,890
- And what'd they say?

2085
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:17,071
- They forgave me.

2086
01:41:20,161 --> 01:41:24,426
They sat on my hospital
bed and totally forgave me.

2087
01:41:28,386 --> 01:41:30,780
They said it was an accident

2088
01:41:34,349 --> 01:41:37,482
and we know that Terry
is in a good place.

2089
01:41:39,267 --> 01:41:44,098
And that he's okay and that
he would want you to be okay.

2090
01:41:45,186 --> 01:41:47,057
He loved you very much.

2091
01:41:50,234 --> 01:41:52,628
- How long ago was that?

2092
01:41:52,715 --> 01:41:53,759
- Four years.

2093
01:41:57,415 --> 01:42:01,419
Anyway, that's what I
didn't tell you guys before.

2094
01:42:03,552 --> 01:42:06,555
- Cole, I'm so sorry
for what I said.

2095
01:42:07,643 --> 01:42:09,993
- It's okay Mollie, it's okay.

2096
01:42:14,084 --> 01:42:16,478
I guess if I really believe,

2097
01:42:18,001 --> 01:42:20,873
I should let Christ
take care of that.

2098
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,571
- Look for Christ

2099
01:42:22,658 --> 01:42:26,227
and you will find him and
with him, everything else.

2100
01:42:28,446 --> 01:42:30,013
- [Both] C.S. Lewis.

2101
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,582
[gentle music]

2102
01:43:15,101 --> 01:43:18,017
[zippers whirring]

2103
01:43:21,456 --> 01:43:24,110
[all chattering]

2104
01:43:26,287 --> 01:43:27,636
- Is that my phone?

2105
01:43:27,723 --> 01:43:28,985
- Hey guys, I have
the best idea ever.

2106
01:43:29,072 --> 01:43:30,639
Okay, next weekend.

2107
01:43:30,726 --> 01:43:32,031
- Look at those notifications.

2108
01:43:32,118 --> 01:43:33,424
- Next weekend we
get back together

2109
01:43:33,511 --> 01:43:34,904
and we go on a ski retreat.

2110
01:43:34,991 --> 01:43:37,167
- Guys, guys, guys hey um.

2111
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:43,086
Look, I need to
tell you something.

2112
01:43:44,609 --> 01:43:46,176
Does it seem kind of
strange to you guys

2113
01:43:46,263 --> 01:43:48,744
that we are shooting this video?

2114
01:43:48,831 --> 01:43:49,658
- I mean yeah, it's
always been weird.

2115
01:43:49,745 --> 01:43:51,007
- I don't know.

2116
01:43:51,094 --> 01:43:52,095
- Yeah, I guess
it does in a way.

2117
01:43:52,182 --> 01:43:53,488
- Why are we making this video?

2118
01:43:53,575 --> 01:43:54,489
- You guys think
it's about Fielding?

2119
01:43:54,576 --> 01:43:55,577
About his book, right?

2120
01:43:55,664 --> 01:43:56,404
- It is.

2121
01:43:56,491 --> 01:43:57,187
- Yes.

2122
01:43:57,274 --> 01:43:57,970
- Yeah.

2123
01:43:58,057 --> 01:43:59,102
- Yeah.

2124
01:44:00,059 --> 01:44:00,973
- It's not.

2125
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:01,844
- What?

2126
01:44:01,931 --> 01:44:03,367
- What do you mean?

2127
01:44:03,454 --> 01:44:05,239
- I want to get in the
film program at USC.

2128
01:44:05,326 --> 01:44:07,676
- What, what does that
have to do with anything?

2129
01:44:07,763 --> 01:44:08,807
- Well, see.

2130
01:44:11,157 --> 01:44:12,724
- Where are you going with this?

2131
01:44:12,811 --> 01:44:14,073
- Let me explain, look.

2132
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,380
USC, they need a
sample of my work,

2133
01:44:16,467 --> 01:44:19,862
you know, like reel and,
well, I don't have one.

2134
01:44:19,949 --> 01:44:20,428
So--

2135
01:44:20,515 --> 01:44:22,038
- So?

2136
01:44:22,125 --> 01:44:25,346
- I thought I'd maybe
do one about you guys.

2137
01:44:27,043 --> 01:44:30,742
And I had no idea it
would turn out like this.

2138
01:44:30,829 --> 01:44:32,483
I mean, I didn't have a clue.

2139
01:44:32,570 --> 01:44:34,093
- As usual.

2140
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,878
- I mean, I thought that
you got to talk about like,

2141
01:44:35,965 --> 01:44:38,272
I don't know, different
kinds of stuff,

2142
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:40,143
not the kinds of stuff
that you guys talked about.

2143
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:44,190
- So wait, you and
Oscar Fielding what?

2144
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:45,104
You set this up?

2145
01:44:45,191 --> 01:44:46,105
- Yeah, sort of.

2146
01:44:47,542 --> 01:44:50,284
Actually, no, okay,
no, not exactly.

2147
01:44:52,938 --> 01:44:54,026
- Who sent the email?

2148
01:44:54,113 --> 01:44:54,897
- Yeah.

2149
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,769
- I did.

2150
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,640
- What?

2151
01:44:59,989 --> 01:45:01,033
Are you serious?

2152
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:02,339
- No way.

2153
01:45:02,426 --> 01:45:04,036
- No.

2154
01:45:04,123 --> 01:45:06,778
- Yeah, I sent the email,
I set this whole thing up.

2155
01:45:06,865 --> 01:45:09,651
- So do you even
know Oscar Fielding?

2156
01:45:09,738 --> 01:45:10,739
- Oh yeah, I
definitely know him.

2157
01:45:10,826 --> 01:45:12,001
He's my uncle.

2158
01:45:13,176 --> 01:45:14,220
- And he agreed to all this?

2159
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,135
- No, no, he didn't.

2160
01:45:17,746 --> 01:45:20,401
He doesn't know
about any of this.

2161
01:45:20,488 --> 01:45:23,142
- This whole thing
was your idea.

2162
01:45:23,229 --> 01:45:26,102
- How many emails did you send?

2163
01:45:26,189 --> 01:45:27,146
- About 5,000.

2164
01:45:29,714 --> 01:45:31,020
- Where'd you get them?

2165
01:45:31,107 --> 01:45:33,196
- You don't wanna know.

2166
01:45:33,283 --> 01:45:34,110
- We don't wanna know?

2167
01:45:34,197 --> 01:45:34,980
- Okay.

2168
01:45:36,199 --> 01:45:38,027
- And you picked us?

2169
01:45:39,289 --> 01:45:40,072
- Yeah.

2170
01:45:41,160 --> 01:45:42,205
- Why?

2171
01:45:44,947 --> 01:45:45,556
Wow.

2172
01:45:47,036 --> 01:45:49,081
- I can't believe
we fell for this.

2173
01:45:49,168 --> 01:45:51,301
- So the camera's yours?

2174
01:45:51,388 --> 01:45:52,563
- How'd you get this cabin?

2175
01:45:52,650 --> 01:45:53,825
- It's my uncle Oscars,

2176
01:45:53,912 --> 01:45:55,131
but I know the
combination to the door.

2177
01:45:55,218 --> 01:45:57,612
- Does he even know we're here?

2178
01:45:58,874 --> 01:46:00,658
- No way, that's crazy.

2179
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:04,793
- Guys, look around.

2180
01:46:06,403 --> 01:46:09,493
We've all done crazy,
stupid things in life.

2181
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:11,234
- But him who's without sin.

2182
01:46:11,321 --> 01:46:13,018
- Cast the first stone.

2183
01:46:13,105 --> 01:46:14,759
- Any stone throwers?

2184
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:17,849
[all chuckling]

2185
01:46:17,936 --> 01:46:20,156
- Hey, look at it this way,

2186
01:46:20,243 --> 01:46:22,332
it has been pretty amazing.

2187
01:46:22,419 --> 01:46:25,204
- Yeah, and if it
weren't for Spielberg

2188
01:46:26,641 --> 01:46:29,034
we never would have
met each other.

2189
01:46:29,121 --> 01:46:30,079
- Thanks guys.

2190
01:46:30,166 --> 01:46:32,342
- Well, hold on, like you're,

2191
01:46:32,429 --> 01:46:33,256
you're going to take this video

2192
01:46:33,343 --> 01:46:35,258
you've been making about us,

2193
01:46:35,345 --> 01:46:38,566
about me and use
it to get into USC?

2194
01:46:38,653 --> 01:46:40,045
- Oh come on, I
thought if you knew

2195
01:46:40,132 --> 01:46:41,133
what was going on
you wouldn't do it.

2196
01:46:41,220 --> 01:46:42,178
You wouldn't help me.

2197
01:46:42,265 --> 01:46:44,093
- Whoa, you didn't trust us?

2198
01:46:44,180 --> 01:46:45,268
- Not at first.

2199
01:46:48,445 --> 01:46:52,188
Look, would it be
cool if I edited it

2200
01:46:52,275 --> 01:46:54,538
and like showed it to you guys

2201
01:46:54,625 --> 01:46:58,281
and I can take out
whatever you don't like.

2202
01:46:58,368 --> 01:47:00,457
Hey, I'm good with whatever.

2203
01:47:02,285 --> 01:47:06,245
- All of those who can sustain
brother Spielberg's proposal,

2204
01:47:06,332 --> 01:47:08,770
do so with the uplifted hand.

2205
01:47:11,860 --> 01:47:13,688
- You guys are the best.

2206
01:47:13,775 --> 01:47:16,865
- Can we wait till
I tell my parents?

2207
01:47:18,344 --> 01:47:19,737
Fine man, this is ridiculous.

2208
01:47:19,824 --> 01:47:21,304
- You're nuts.

2209
01:47:21,391 --> 01:47:22,914
- I can't believe you
thought of that idea.

2210
01:47:23,001 --> 01:47:26,222
- Classic, classic, Spielberg.

2211
01:47:26,309 --> 01:47:28,267
- You're an evil genius.

2212
01:47:28,354 --> 01:47:32,315
- I cannot believe we
were fooled by a child.

2213
01:47:32,402 --> 01:47:33,708
- That's what I'm saying.

2214
01:47:33,795 --> 01:47:35,100
- I'm gonna hold you because.

2215
01:47:35,187 --> 01:47:35,971
- Oh yeah, watch out.

2216
01:47:36,058 --> 01:47:37,494
- I'm super klutzy.

2217
01:47:38,713 --> 01:47:39,931
- The snow is so tall.

2218
01:47:40,018 --> 01:47:41,106
- Yeah, I was just gonna say.

2219
01:47:41,193 --> 01:47:43,108
It's over you're head.

2220
01:47:43,195 --> 01:47:45,633
I can't believe that
you live right by me.

2221
01:47:45,720 --> 01:47:47,025
- Oh I know, all this time.

2222
01:47:47,112 --> 01:47:48,287
- Yeah, it's like we're
meant to be friends.

2223
01:47:48,374 --> 01:47:51,290
[all chattering]

2224
01:48:06,523 --> 01:48:10,484
- Well, Mollie, you have
one final quote for us?

2225
01:48:13,356 --> 01:48:16,141
- God's goodness hath
been great to us,

2226
01:48:17,534 --> 01:48:20,494
let never day nor
night on hallowed paths

2227
01:48:21,973 --> 01:48:25,281
but still remember what
the Lord hath done.

2228
01:48:25,368 --> 01:48:26,761
- Proverbs?

2229
01:48:26,848 --> 01:48:30,939
- Henry the sixth, part
two, act two, scene one.

2230
01:48:34,943 --> 01:48:37,815
- Well guys, I
guess that's a wrap.

2231
01:48:41,471 --> 01:48:43,299
- Hey, before we split, we
should get a group picture.

2232
01:48:43,386 --> 01:48:44,343
- Yes.

2233
01:48:44,430 --> 01:48:45,127
- Oh yeah.

2234
01:48:45,214 --> 01:48:45,954
- Please.

2235
01:48:46,041 --> 01:48:46,520
- Okay I got it.

2236
01:48:46,607 --> 01:48:47,303
- Selfie.

2237
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:48,086
- All together.

2238
01:48:48,173 --> 01:48:49,000
- Get in there.

2239
01:48:49,087 --> 01:48:50,393
- Okay, everyone in?

2240
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,350
- You got to get me
in I'm not in it.

2241
01:48:51,437 --> 01:48:52,395
- Here we go.

2242
01:48:52,482 --> 01:48:55,093
Okay, ready and one, two, three.

2243

Funny face.

2245
01:48:57,182 --> 01:48:58,749

01:49:02,361 --> 01:49:03,841
- Hey, I'll email to you guys.

2250
01:49:03,928 --> 01:49:06,844
- You are not allowed
to email me ever again.

2251
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:07,671
- I'll see you, we're fine.

2252
01:49:07,758 --> 01:49:08,846

01:49:08,933 --> 01:49:10,413
