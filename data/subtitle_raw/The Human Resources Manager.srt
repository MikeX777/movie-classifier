<i>You have 2 new messages.</i>

2
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,120
You know it's Wednesday, right?
- Of course.

3
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:59,082
I'll finish up and I'm off.

4
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,807
Should I wait for you?
- No.

5
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,087
I'll say it again, it's impossible.

6
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,850
Is the paycheck ours or not?

7
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,647
Ours.

8
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,761
This article will be published

9
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,609
in the weekend edition
of the city's number one paper.

10
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,644
That's 300,000 readers,
all of whom are our customers.

11
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,568
Fortunately, the editor
owes me a favor

12
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,522
and he's letting us
publish a response.

13
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,039
I'll take care of it.
First thing in the morning...

14
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,400
Not in the morning.
Now.

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,285
Sit.

16
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,685
We have till 5 a.m.,
when the paper goes to print.

17
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,485
You have to find out exactly
what did or didn't happen,

18
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,286
and write an accurate,
comprehensive...

19
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:22,448
Hey...
and courteous response.

20
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:24,045
Tonight.

21
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,646
You're paying for the cab. That's A.
- And B?

22
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,364
And this is B.
OK, where's that fax...?

23
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,965
Here, we'll put it on...

24
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,799
Are you too hot?
Here, take this.

25
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,883
You want Mom?
Soon, soon...

26
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,241
There's an employee number
on this paycheck, or part of it.

27
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,362
I tried that. It doesn't work...
- I'm sure. Let's see.

28
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,529
"First name: Yehuda.
Last name: Elbaz."

29
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,079
Where's the baby?

30
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,038
Right here...

31
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,999
It's OK.

32
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:29,524
Look, little guy.

33
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,604
Found Her!

34
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,769
Yulia...

35
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,369
What is it, Petrecke...?

36
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,606
Petracke.

37
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,960
Pretty, isn't she?
Looks very young.

38
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:55,048
What department was she in?
- "General employees".

39
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,798
They clean up the shit
no one wants to touch.

40
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,759
In our case someone forgot to tell us
he was missing an employee.

41
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,724
In this case it was
the night shift supervisor.

42
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,322
That was her last shift.

43
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,448
You remember her?

44
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,524
Of course.
She's a foreign worker, right?

45
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,846
Any family?
- Didn't you ask? - No.

46
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,483
I'm going to talk
to the night shift supervisor...

47
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,760
Negative. I'm coming with you.
- Negative, you're not.

48
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,961
I want to know how come
we forgot Julia.

49
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:30,845
We didn't forget anyone,
take this cute little thing home.

50
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,200
But I... - Tomorrow.
- But... - Tomorrow!

51
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,969
<i>Yacov Ohana, Yacov Ohana, come</i>
<i>to the office during the break...</i>

52
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,844
Hello.

53
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,519
Hello.

54
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,087
I'm the HR Manager.

55
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,323
I know who you are.

56
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,164
I'm looking for one of your employees.
Yulia Petracke.

57
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,249
She's here?

58
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,207
No, Yulia doesn't
work here anymore. - Oh, really?

59
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:32,681
I fired her.
- I see.

60
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,122
How long ago,
if I may...?

61
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,522
I don't know.
About a month ago.

62
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,798
Fine. Thanks.

63
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,559
Let me ask you something else.

64
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,643
How does a night shift supervisor
let someone go without notifying HR?

65
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,927
We paid a salary, taxes,
social security...

66
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,280
for someone who doesn't
even exist in the system?

67
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,958
Excuse me. Yulia Petracke
was a temporary worker

68
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,162
and I had full authority to dismiss her.
- Is that so?

69
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,565
Excuse me.

70
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,685
Just like that?
Your choice to make?

71
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,841
Did you know she has
a degree in engineering? - Well?

72
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,523
You sent the poor woman to scrub
floors and you blame me now?

73
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,885
So she got an extra paycheck,
so what?

74
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,083
Deduct it from my salary,
and let me get back to work.

75
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,808
I have nothing more to say.

76
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:41,009
Your engineer was killed
in a suicide bombing

77
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,761
at the Mahane Yehuda market.

78
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,281
She's been lying in a morgue because
no one realized she was missing.

79
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,367
Then someone found
our paycheck on her,

80
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,562
and now they're accusing me,
the widow, and everyone here

81
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:57,160
of criminal neglect
and lack of humanity.

82
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,799
Understand?

83
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:05,282
Authority or not,
look at the damage...

84
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,762
OK, no harm done.

85
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:29,125
You said she was no longer with us for
over a month so there's no problem.

86
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,160
Next time just report it, that's all.
Alright, back to work.

87
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,805
Thank you.

88
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,640
"The bakery's response
to the paper's accusations.

89
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,683
"...If your esteemed newspaper
showed some sensitivity..."

90
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,689
"Sincerely yours,
Human Resources Manager"

91
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,241
Are you nuts?
I almost ran you over!

92
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:19,202
I need to talk to you.
May I?

93
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,364
Come to my office tomorrow.
- Please. Just a minute.

94
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,164
Thanks.

95
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,118
Enjoy it.

96
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,962
Thank you for coming.

97
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,649
Why couldn't this wait
till tomorrow?

98
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,045
I didn't mean
to fall in love with her.

99
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,886
We would just go smoke together.

100
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,480
We would talk about the shift,
the bakery,

101
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,641
as much as we could,

102
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,442
she barely knew any Hebrew.

103
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,564
I'd wait outside,
holding my lighter.

104
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,526
Scared she might not come out.

105
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,962
Then she'd come to where I stood,
in the dark,

106
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,318
and...

107
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,642
I was in heaven.

108
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:31,603
Every two hours,
for five minutes, I was in heaven.

109
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,721
Then my wife noticed.

110
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,687
Caught me singing one day.

111
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,846
You see, I'm fixing her medicine
before the shift,

112
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:54,929
and I'm singing...

113
00:10:58,050 --> 00:10:59,449
What can I say.

114
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,283
I fell hard.

115
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,164
I quit... three months.

116
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,809
So I let her go.

117
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,362
I didn't want her
to hate me,

118
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:18,209
and wanted to help her
get by till her next job,

119
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,038
so I kept her on the payroll.

120
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,483
Yulia Petracke,

121
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:30,050
employee No. 535.
General Cleaning.

122
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,965
Well...

123
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:39,281
I have to go take care of all this.

124
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,164
It's OK.

125
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,929
<i>You forgot again it's Wednesday?</i>
<i>The kid is alone at home for hours.</i>

126
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,404
<i>Can't you be trusted?</i>

127
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,682
What do you want? A worker
was killed. Did I have a choice?

128
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,199
<i>I heard.</i>
<i>I already told her.</i>

129
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:07,969
<i>Look, I...</i>
<i>- Wait a minute.</i>

130
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,081
Is everything alright?
- Yes. Everything's fine.

131
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,168
Go.
- Thanks.

132
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,885
<i>I'm with you.</i>
<i>- I'm working late tonight.</i>

133
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,205
<i>Stay with her until I get back.</i>

134
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,719
<i>OK, no problem.</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

135
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,045
Bye.

146
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,208
Sorry about the mess.

147
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,520
One of your workers died
and you didn't know.

148
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,083
Forget about it.

149
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,569
How was ballet?

150
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,564
How come you didn't know?
- I don't know, darling.

Forget it. It's not important.

You have a class trip next week,
don't you? Lucky you.

153
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,364
I'm not going.
- What do you mean?

154
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,565
I don't feel like it.

155
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,558
Sweetie, I know it's hard,

156
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,806
but what can you do?
It's hard.

157
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,524
It's hard for me and your mom too.

158
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,088
What if I join the trip?

159
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,283
As a chaperone.
You'd like it?

160
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,926
Can you?
- Sure I can.

161
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,126
I'll call your teacher tomorrow.
OK?

162

I'll have another one

hope it's OK.

00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:40,448
"Terminated almost three weeks
before her tragic death".

175
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,279
You found a way to retroactively
fire her just to get off the hook.

176
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,050
It was a bureaucratic error
by a supervisor. - Who?

177
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,844
Describing it as
a monstrous lack of humanity...

178
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,486
Look, they found a paycheck
of yours on her body when she died.

179
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:59,322
You kept her for a week in a fridge
for your article, and we are inumane?

180
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:01,043
Listen, Mr. Human Resources,

181
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,718
I'm not worried about the dead.
I care about the living.

182
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,398
And I hate the ease
in which you corporations...

183
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,089
Corporations? We're a bakery!!!

184
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,963
...exploit their workers...
and then forget they even existed!

185
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,368
So she spent a few more days
in the morgue cause of me, so what?

186
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:18,648
If I can squeeze some emotion
out of my indifferent readers

187
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,002
and make them a little angrier
at your wrongdoings, I've done my job.

188
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:26,122
And that's moral for you?
- What can I say, tough times.

189
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,482
Listen, my article's going to press,
whether you like it or not,

190
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,567
so maybe instead
of wasting your time,

191
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:35,319
you should go to the morgue
and identify that poor woman.

192
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,445
Think about it,
she has nobody else.

193
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:42,322
It's your job, isn't it?
Or is HR just a temporary gig

194
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,964
till you get through
with the divorce? - Listen...

195
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:05,006
<i>At this very late hour</i>
<i>we try to look for some solace</i>

196
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,043
<i>that will ease our souls.</i>

197
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,365
<i>Here are some tunes...</i>

198
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:33,004
Hello?

199
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,803
Hi.
- You scared me to death.

200
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,885
I'm looking for one
of the bombing's casualties.

201
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:04,001
The pizzeria?
- No, the marketplace.

202
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,768
I'm from the bakery.

203
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:09,484
Glad you came by.

204
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,368
We've been waiting for you...

205
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:14,481
We'll be sorry to see her go,
you know?

206
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:18,567
We get used to them after a while.

207
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,247
We even give them names.

208
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,608
We called her "Angel".

209
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,128
So what was her name?

210
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:31,488
If you'd called us instead of that wease
from the paper, you'd already know.

211
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,721
Look, we were angry.

212
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,360
Two, three days went by,

213
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,078
no word from anyone
and that "weasel",

214
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,724
he's around here a lot,
offered to help.

215
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,201
So who is our honored guest?

216
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:50,880
I would like to thank you
on her behalf.

217
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,245
Yulia...

218
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,203
Pretty name.

219
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,562
We figured she came from there.
- Anything else?

220
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:05,488
Come, sir.
Let's take a look.

221
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,486
No way.
I gave you her employee info.

222
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,478
I'm not her relative
or her friend or anything,

223
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,325
I'm her employer.
I was.

224
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,760
Let me explain
something to you, sir.

225
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,808
To release Ms. Yulia
I need a positive ID.

226
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,805
The truth is
I don't really remember her.

227
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,602
You came all this way.

228
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,645
Please.

229
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,440
Come.

230
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,121
Now you'll see what I meant.

231
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,406
Wait.

232
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,045
First time? I see...

233
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,439
Come.

234
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,321
These are her keys, right?
- Yes.

235
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,883
I have the address.
- So?

236
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,160
If one matches the other,
we have a positive ID.

237
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,046
No... - It's much better than a visual ID
by someone who didn't know her.

238
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,888
Look, it doesn't work like that.

239
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,204
Excuse me?

240
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:34,118
Beth Israel street?

241
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,726
Go straight and turn right.
- Thank you.

242
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,719
Beth Israel street?
- Right here. - Thank you.

243
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:06,282
Excuse me, Beth Israel 3?

244
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,198
Yulia...

245
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,161
Are you looking for Ruth?

246
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,162
Where does Ruth live?

247
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,327
There, come with us.

248
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,486
It's over there.
- Thank you.

249
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:38,725
Thanks.

250
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:43,923
"Ruth"

251
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,966
<i>"Har Ha'Zofim morgue".</i>
<i>- I'm inside. We have an ID.</i>

252
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:58,640
<i>OK, but you should know</i>
<i>it doesn't work this way.</i>

253
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,479
<i>It's unacceptable.</i>
<i>- We'll do better next time.</i>

254
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,839
<i>You have to sign...</i>

255
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,526
<i>"Dear Yulia, from your friend</i>
<i>on the night shift"</i>

256
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:14,681
<i>"Mori"</i>
<i>by L. I Riklis</i>

257
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:58,842
They'll add that the bakery's
representative identified the body,

258
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,087
our condolences, we share
the family's grief...

259
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:07,890
Good work. You did very well,
I thank you very much.

260
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,122
You did above and beyond.
Good work.

261
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,366
It's OK, main thing is
we're off the hook.

262
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,922
I have to rest my head.
- Wait.

263
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:22,970
I've decided to admit
it was our fault and apologize.

264
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,080
Hi, David.

265
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,168
I also intend to repent.

266
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,645
We'll have a dignified funeral,
like she deserves.

267
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,205
We'll take care of her daughter...
- Son. - What?

268
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,878
She had a boy, not a girl.
I don't get you.

269
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:37,809
I spent the whole night
getting us off the hook,

270
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,602
and now you decide to confess?

271
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:42,685
Are you punishing me?
- Come on...

272
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,405
That's what it is.
- You hate your job, I know it.

273
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,888
Trapped in that office.
You need action.

274
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,645
So unwind for a few days.

275
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,248
So you are from the bakery.

276
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,599
Yes.

277
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:16,602
Yulia believed that God
lead her to this city.

278
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,482
She was happy here.

279
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,241
She'll have a nice view?
- Yes,

280
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,401
facing the Liors Gate.

281
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,642
The best seat in the house.

282
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,407
Been in Jerusalem a long time?

283
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,921
It took me a long time to get here.

284
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,361
Nothing is easy here,
and everything is complicated.

285
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,329
Tell me about it.

286
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,402
But it fills your soul.

287
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,400
Thank you so much for contacting us.

288
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,728
What happens next?

289
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,205
Now we'll contact your
social security bureau

290
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,809
and make the burial arrangements.

291
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,480
The owner of the bakery wants
to do all she can to help Yulia

292
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,840
and she has a lot of connections
with the city.

293
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,401
One phone call from her
can work miracles.

294
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,886
If you don't mind our involvement,
of course. - Not at all.

295
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,568
Yulia deserves a miracle.

296
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:07,763
"Appalling inumanity
at the city's biggest bakery"

297
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:15,758
"HR Manager: I'm guilty."

298
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,924
Good evening. I'm sorry,
Madame is sleeping now.

299
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,324
Sleeping?

300
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:56,003
You can come in.

301
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:02,123
Sorry for not getting up,
I can hardly stand on my feet.

302
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:08,244
I apologize.

303
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:12,200
I wanted a partner. Someone
to share the burden with me.

304
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:14,685
A scapegoat.
That's what you wanted.

305
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,045
A scapegoat.

306
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,925
Stop making such a fuss.
Who cares about that tabloid?

307
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,440
I don't. And I don't care
about the readers.

308
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,766
I care that you went
behind my back.

309
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,049
If you're not happy with my work,
say so.

310
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,281
So here, I'm saying so.

311
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:35,999
Great.

312
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,200
Don't act like a child!

313
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,441
You want to talk - we'll talk.

314
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,365
When you asked me
to bring you back to Jerusalem

315
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,767
so you could take care
of your personal affairs,

316
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,608
I said "gladly".

317
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,686
I care about you, as an employee
and as a person, you deserve it.

318
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,801
So I vacated the job

319
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,480
and waited patiently for you
to come back and fit in...

320
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,723
And you came back
but only in body.

321
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:16,287
Your soul, your head, they were
somewhere else, opening factories.

322
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,605
King of the hill.

323
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:20,563
You know who you sound like
right now? - Yes.

324
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,726
What did your wife want?

325
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,807
Just for you to come back
and be here for her.

326
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,400
What's that got to do with it?
You want my resignation?

327
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:31,078
It will be on your desk
first thing in the morning, OK?

328
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,440
Oh... you're so dramatic.

329
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,203
I know I owe you for all
you've done for the bakery.

330
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,049
But you owe me, too.

331
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,039
Want one?

332
00:28:55,570 --> 00:29:01,566
I understand the family wants
to have the body sent to them.

333
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:05,322
So tomorrow morning
Yulia Petricka...

334
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,521
Petracke...
- Petracke.

335
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,368
Will be flown out

336
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:14,849
with compensation
from the bakery and...

337
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,769
you will represent us at the funeral.

338
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,443
<i>The next wave of terror attacks</i>
<i>in Jerusalem is certain...</i>

339
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,242
<i>This terrorism is</i>
<i>beating down on us</i>

340
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,362
<i>it has shocked city residents,</i>
<i>but I'm telling you:</i>

341
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:39,324
<i>Let's be strong until this passes.</i>
<i>- But that could take a long time,</i>

342
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:41,009
<i>and in the meantime?</i>

343
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,841
<i>We must be wise and careful</i>
<i>and keep our children safe.</i>

344
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:03,604
If you really wanted to come in
you'd bring flowers.

345
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:20,046
You'll miss her class trip.
You know that. - Why?

346
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:23,925
Her trip is on Wednesday. I'll be back
Monday, Tuesday, at the latest.

347
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:28,999
Wednesday I'm on the bus with her,
with a smile, a hat and a sandwich.

348
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,360
Actually it's none of my business.

349
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:34,204
Even where you're here,
you're absent.

350
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,402
Come back whenever you like.

351
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,365
Great.

352
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,644
You really think I need this...?

353
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,882
I don't, OK? I don't.

354
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,958
I don't need this whole
humiliation journey.

355
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,647
But you're going, aren't you?
You can't say no to the widow.

356
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,523
That has nothing to do with the widow.

357
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:02,039
There's a boy there, her family.

358
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,447
You can't send a coffin
without a representative.

359
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,239
Turns out the widow isn't too happy
with my performance in the department.

360
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,243
She's punishing me.

361
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,360
Stop.

362
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,085
Hey, sweetie.

363
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,479
Hi, Dad.

364
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:05,445
Don't worry, it's just for a few days.
By Wednesday I'm back. I promise.

365
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,166
Promises again?
Don't promise!

366
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:12,563
It's the employee I told you about...
- Yulia?

367
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,488
I'm taking her home.

368
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,650
I told you someone
would look out for her, didn't I?

369
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,929
Great. Now one more
but with a smile.

370
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:22,044
What are you doing here?
- Follow-up, bro.

371
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:24,321
I'm with you all the way.

372
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,119
Stay away from me.
Got it?

373
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,047
No, no, no,
I'm not in charge here, OK?

374
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:58,559
Someone from
the Israeli consulate will...

375
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,121
they need to be here.

376
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:28,560
Look how late it is.
He's here already.

377
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,839
Oh, my God!

378
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,803
When did you get here? - An hour ago.
Where's the Consul?

379
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,841
I am the Consul,
nice to meet you.

380
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,245
Is that all you brought, that wallet?
- Wait... - No, let me...

381
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:43,168
you look like you're about to faint.

382
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,960
Thank you.
The officer made me sign a...

383
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,489
I released the coffin

384
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,523
and they're about to load her,
the poor thing.

385
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,761
My husband, the Vice Consul.

386
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:00,565
Hello. I'm very sorry for your loss.
A big tragedy.

387
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,089
Really, very big.

388
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,481
Those good-for-nothing!
Wait here.

389
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:08,040
Mister Officer?
- Yes, Ma'am, yes.

390
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,161
What are you doing? You're leaving?
- Yes, Ma'am.

391
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,928
Where is the truck?
- What truck?

392
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,645
To transfer the body.
- I don't know. Is it signed? It is.

393
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:20,162
I want to talk to someone
in charge here. - Please calm down.

394
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,645
Is there a problem?
- Yes, there's a problem.

395
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,569
You signed for the body,
now you're responsible for transport.

396
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:28,807
What?! - You don't sign anything
carelessly here.

397
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,568
I need to be back
in Israel in 2 days.

398
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,001
Don't worry,
he will moan and groan,

399
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:35,928
and eventually he'll send a truck.

400
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:39,327
Arert you giving me a truck?
- Ma'am, it's impossible.

401
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,361
Excuse me.

402
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,204
Let me explain something,
Mr. Human Resources Manager.

403
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:02,480
Here you're neither in the East
nor in the West.

404
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,646
Things don't work
the way you're used to.

405
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,600
Wasting money is exactly
what I was trying to avoid.

406
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:10,960
After two flights I have no time
for bureaucracy.

407
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,730
Anyway, these are the bakery's
private funds.

408
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:17,480
Oh, well, excuse me,
Monsieur Baron Rothschild...

409
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,041
Mister Officer, where is the truck?

410
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,799
Excuse me, what about this one?
- Don't even think about it!

411
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,280
It's a consular car,
not a funeral vehicle.

412
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,845
Stop, wait.

413
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:55,326
Is he with us?
- Not with me.

414
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,042
When they assigned me here,
I said no thanks. I knew it was a dump.

415
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:09,447
But what's the first thing
I see when I get off the plane?

416
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,289
This cuddly thing,

417
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,562
holding up a sign with my name.
Spelled with seven mistakes.

418
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,489
<b>He was a driver,
now he's Vice Consul.

419
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,762
Can't speak a word of Hebrew,
but has the soul of a Jew...

420
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,123
That's all that matters.
Look at the road, you want to kill us?

421
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,766
So what's the plan?

422
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:29,438
Everything's arranged
with the Anti-Semites at the church.

423
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,368
The funeral is Monday morning.

424
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:35,041
We'll stop at the husband's place
to sign the burial certificate.

425
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,367
For him, you, me and the entire
Jewish nation killed the lady.

426
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:49,930
We are very experienced
in this kind of procedure.

427
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:53,760
Your poor worker isn't
the first to come back in a coffin.

428
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,647
But you're the first boss to come
with the body. Very impressive!

429
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:01,842
He's the first one to escort a coffin.
Nice, right? - Bravo.

430
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,684
Bravo.

431
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,446
You see? A good Jew.

432
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,165
Bravo.

433
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,248
Let me see it.

434
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,848
Ten. Ten. - How much?
- Ten. - Four.

435
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:34,849
- Legenda não traduzida -

436
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,241
OK, five.
- Five.

437
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,285
Well?

438
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:53,721
I'll be back soon, sweetie.

439
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,486
No, it's just a formality. You can
meet the gentleman at the funeral.

440
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,969
That's alright.

441
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:19,202
A real gentleman, as I told you.
Believe me, no need for this bread.

442
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,605
<u>Hello. I'm the Israeli Consulesa.

443
00:39:25,810 --> 00:39:28,768
This gentleman came with your
wife's coffin. My condolences.

444
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,198
Very sorry, sir.

445
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,566
Tell him that we're very sorry,
and hope that this modest amount

446
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,169
will help him overcome...
- No, I'm sorry,

447
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:40,248
you can't come here spreading
money everywhere.

448
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,929
He just has to sign.

449
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,563
How do you say "thank you"?
- "Multzumesk".

450
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,839
Thanks.

451
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,409
Thank you.

452
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,005
Thanks.
I'll keep it but I can't help you.

453
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:07,528
I can't sign
because we are divorced.

454
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:11,083
He says thanks for the money
but he won't sign

455
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,804
because he's not her family,
they were divorced.

456
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:15,728
You were divorced, right?
- Yes.

457
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:19,008
You and your private funds
really fix everything...

458
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,218
What about the son?

459
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:29,023
They have a son, right?
Let him sign.

460
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,927
Mr. Petracke, is your son here?

461
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:35,409
The boy is not here. He's gone,
he doesn't know where.

462
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,283
He doesn't even know.

463
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,198
Doesrt know what?

464
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,921
The boy doesn't know
about his mother.

465
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,602
Police! Run! Police!

466
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:14,164
Left, left!
No, Stop!

467
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,761
No, it's not here,
let's go.

468
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,325
Police!

469
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,767
Don't touch me!

470
00:41:56,870 --> 00:41:58,223
I hate you!

471
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,089
Let me go!

472
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,005
My son.

473
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,565
Look...

474
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,129
We want to talk to you
about something important.

475
00:42:31,770 --> 00:42:34,000
You speak English, yes?

476
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,646
Can I get some help here?

477
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:50,184
The lady wants to talk to you.
So shut up and listen! Can you?

478
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:52,886
Can you listen!?
- You shut up!

479
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,927
Who told you to come here?

480
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,201
You kicked me out of the house.

481
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,204
Fuck you
and your stupid friends!

482
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,889
You can all go to hell!

483
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,763
Get your hands off me!
- This kid is an animal.

484
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:07,628
Child, calm down.

485
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:09,261
Something bad...

486
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,300
happened to your mother.

487
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,308
You think you know everything?
Do you?

488
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,628
Go look in the car.

489
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:20,785
Go!

490
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:13,982
Strange people.

491
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:32,582
They killed her.

492
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,148
They can take her back
to the market where she died,

493
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,708
burn her body

494
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:46,264
and spread
her ashes everywhere.

495
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:51,461
That's what they can do.

496
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,748
You can tell them that.

497
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,338
It's not helping, OK?

498
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:06,188
You know what the boy said?

499
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,541
I'm sorry,
this is not a normal family.

500
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,503
Tell them I want Nana.
Tell them to bring Nana.

501
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:14,669
They're not bringing Nana,
so you can forget about that!

502
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,986
She's Mama's family,
not yours!

503
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,068
What is it? - He wants us to bring
his grandma to the funeral.

504
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,068
Which grandmother?
- Yulia's mother.

505
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:27,422
Just have the boy sign the papers.
- He can't, he's a minor.

506
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:30,663
Can the grandmother sign?
- Yes.

507
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,747
Then we'll bring whoever he wants...

508
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:34,729
How generous of you.
- Shut up.

509
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:38,061
Excuse me, but that grandmother's
village is over 0001 km from here!

510
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:40,989
There's no airport there.
- Fine, a helicopter then.

511
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:42,942
Will you tell them?

512
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:47,429
Mr. Petracke, we'll bring her
with a helicopter.

513
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:55,065
OK, let's go home for dinner...

514
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,982
Blessed are you Lord our God,

515
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,579
who has sanctified us
and commanded us... - Amen.

516
00:47:15,790 --> 00:47:17,621
To light the candles of Shabbat.
Amen.

517
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,424
Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

518
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:26,066
Most important is how to bring
Mrs. Petracke to eternal rest...

519
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:29,068
If we go to church without
a signed burial certificate.

520
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:32,148
They'll send you back home,
coffin and all.

521
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,022
Not that I'm worried.

522
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:37,302
Did you locate the grandmother?

523
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,819
Again?
She can't be reached...

524
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,986
He's driving me crazy
with the grandmother...

525
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:49,863
You're making a mistake.
I'm telling you again.

526
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,061
A big mistake.
And a dangerous one, too.

527
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:54,704
Yes. No? Thanks.

528
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:58,619
So? - I told you, it's a holiday,
no rental cars.

529
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:02,984
And they said on TV
that there's a storm coming,

530
00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:05,146
<b>maybe even today.
- I'll manage.

531
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:07,944
By noon I would have arranged
all the certificates...

532
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:10,738
All this mess is because
the boy wants his grandma?

533
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:14,909
<b>No, because I'm stuck
with the body. That's the mess.

534
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:18,387
<b>And by the way, it's 039 kilometers.
We'll make it.

535
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:22,344
Can I have the keys?
- Sorry, the van won't make it.

536
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,660
Certainly not in the weather
they're predicting.

537
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:27,384
This is where you are mistaken,
Madame Consul.

538
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,421
Don't think about this old van.

539
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:32,428
Think about the new van you'll
be able to buy when we get back.

540
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,946
You're not in the East...
- Nor the West, I know.

541
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:39,788
A trip to the Holy Land?

542
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,088
The bakery would love to invite you
on a vacation to Jerusalem.

543
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:45,640
You think I have time for a trip?

544
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:50,123
Next year in Jerusalem!
- Or Australia.

545
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:53,961
Why do all you Israeli men
think you're irresistible?

546
00:48:56,370 --> 00:48:58,440
Thank you.
- My pleasure. Any time.

547
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,970
Hey! You're not leaving
the reporter here!

548
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:04,638
I wish...

549
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:08,439
Does the widow know about this?
It wasrt part of the deal.

550
00:49:08,690 --> 00:49:11,966
Besides, don't you have a school trip?
Back by Wednesday, tops.

551
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:17,281
Please meet our driver.

552
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:20,882
Very good with cars,
trucks, everything.

553
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,004
Are you sure about him?

554
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,808
He does messenger work for the Consul
for many many years.

555
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,848
I'm very sorry, but with my eyes
we wouldn't get very far.

First of all,
we no longer have a driver.

612

Turns out his license expired
five years ago.

613

there are no charges.

be buried with her family.

We're bringing Yulia Petracke home.

631
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:01,761
Can I get some help here?
- My friend,

632

Mrs. Petracke is already home.

633
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:08,640
Where her body goes,
is a municipal concern.

01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:02,048
But you didn't get back
till February.

685
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:06,162
Did your wife change the locks?

686
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:08,929
Something like that.

687
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:12,887
Never considered bringing them over?
- How about you?

688
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:16,966
You have a family? A wife?
- We're talking about me now?

689
01:05:18,330 --> 01:05:19,968
You live with your mom, huh?

690
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:23,163
That's nonsense.

691
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:39,879
I don't know what
the widow thinks of our crusade.

692
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:43,565
We're making one
hell of a detour here.

693
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:47,601
1000 kilometers out of our way
just to do the right thing.

694
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,479
I'm afraid the storm is coming soon.

695
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,765
Maybe we should stop
somewhere tonight?

696
01:05:57,766 --> 01:05:59,081
Of course.

697
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,930
Maybe I have an idea.

698
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:10,922
Back in communist days some people
thought that if Armageddon comes

699
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,360
this place will save them.

700
01:06:13,570 --> 01:06:15,322
Now I'm not so sure.

701
01:06:15,730 --> 01:06:17,482
OK, but let's have a look.

702

01:06:56,245 --> 01:06:58,390

01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:15,846
It's a big mistake.

853
01:26:33,210 --> 01:26:36,725
What did she say?

854
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,921
She said thank you.

855
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:43,081
That I understood.

856
01:26:43,530 --> 01:26:44,883
What did she really say?

857
01:26:47,530 --> 01:26:49,839
She said you made a big mistake.

858
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:54,488
OK.

859
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:55,963
She thinks that Yulia
does not belong here.

860
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:02,520
She lived in Jerusalem,
she died in Jerusalem,

861
01:27:03,730 --> 01:27:05,049
she must be buried there.

862
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:21,402
What do you think?

863
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:23,958
Me?

864
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:25,439
Yeah, you.
What do you think?

865
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,761
I think...

866
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:32,999
for her, this place is
the end of the world.

867
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:38,083
She wanted to go as far as possible.

868
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:38,649
Even the city was not far enough.

869
01:29:19,570 --> 01:29:21,367
Thank you.

870
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:31,046
It's nice here.
- What are you doing here?

871
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:32,286
Did you miss me?
- A bit.

872
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:33,999
Come here, you moron.

873
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:01,449
When they re-opened the airports,
we got on the first flight out.

874
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:07,046
It took two hours!

875
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:08,689
Let's go to Grandma.

876
01:30:09,730 --> 01:30:12,369
But truly, I prefer your way,
the scenic route.

877
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,881
Otherwise it gets boring.

878
01:30:15,690 --> 01:30:17,806
It's also not as good for the article.

879
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:22,685
Thank you.

880
01:30:25,730 --> 01:30:29,848
OK, where do we eat around here?

881
01:31:05,570 --> 01:31:07,447
<i>Hello?</i>

882
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:12,406
Hi.

883
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:15,440
<i>Hi.</i>

884
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:15,758
I'm coming home.

885
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:18,648
<i>I'm glad.</i>

886
01:31:17,410 --> 01:31:19,401
Bye.

887
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:48,206
One, two, three...

888
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,483
You OK?

889
01:32:16,890 --> 01:32:18,403
I'll come visit...

890
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:20,848
Soon.

891
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:23,002
Bye, kid.
See you.

892
01:33:24,770 --> 01:33:26,522
Wait!

893
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:33,202
Wait!

894
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:37,163
Stop!

895
01:33:38,490 --> 01:33:40,401
Come on!

896
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:45,843
Stop!

897
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,729
Damn it...
