REPORTER (ON TV): The
National Football League,

3
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,000
the Rams could clinch
a divisional title

4
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,600
with a win over the 49ers.

5
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,000
The Raiders shouldn't have
much trouble with Seattle,

6
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,800
and the Patriots
are still 14 point

7
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,700
favorites to defeat the Colts.

8
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,133
11 other games are--

00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,067
Five game slate last evening.

10
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:23,667
The frontman--

[dramatic music]

12
00:02:34,033 --> 00:02:35,367
With the Sabers 41-3.

13
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:38,033
The Canadiens got
past the Flames, 7-6.

14
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,567
Helping the Penguins
pass the Jets--

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,300
Game with the Capitols.

16
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,633
A win for the Caps would--

17
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,333
For Sunday's-- belongs
to Danny Sullivan,

18
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:12,000
after being clocked 219.35
miles an hour in the trials.

19
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,133
Next in line was
Alanser, followed

20
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,400
by the favorite, Rick Mears.

21
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,833
Race time is--

22
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,800
What the hell's
going on out here?

[birds chirping]

27
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,933
Willie, how many times do I
have to tell you not to throw

28
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:05,367
your wet towels on my bed.

29
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,500
Sorry.

30
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,533
I can't believe my
mother's going to Hawaii.

31
00:05:09,633 --> 00:05:13,367
She promised she'd be
here for visiting day.

32
00:05:13,467 --> 00:05:16,667
I'd rather go to Hawaii, too.

33
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:17,567
Thanks.

34
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Will, have you seen my compass?

35
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,967
What, are you blind?

36
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:25,567
It's right in front of you.

37
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,600
You know, Greg, if I
was you, I wouldn't

38
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,067
worry about anything right now.

39
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,200
With those three days
alone in those mountains

40
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,600
you're about to do.

41
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,933
Yeah, I guess I kind of
have my head up my ass, huh?

42
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,100
Willie, is it really that tough?

43
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,133
Well, let's just
say, I wouldn't want

44
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:44,967
to do it again unless I had to.

45
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah, well I'm ready for it.

46
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,333
You better be.

47
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:52,400
See you in a few days, Willie.

48
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,033
Hope you don't get too lonely.

[beeping]

59
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:23,433
Shit.

60
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,467
Mr. Quill?

61
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,367
Something strange is happening
to my computer terminal.

62
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,800
Lisa, just call somebody and
have them look at it for you.

63
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,167
LISA: Yes sir, it's
just that it seems

64
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:47,100
to be locked onto some
kind of priority message.

65
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,333
Well, tell me what it says.

66
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:52,033
LISA: Priority level one,
missing signal property number

67
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:59,867
N1708A, contact reestablished.

68
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:01,367
Hi, Lisa why don't
you take a break?

69
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:06,733
Thank you.

Son of a bitch.

73
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:35,233
This is Quill, is Jack back yet?

74
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,400
Well, then send Leo to meet
me in tracking, right away.

75
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,467
Dump whatever you're working on.

76
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:45,067
Don't be ridiculous, I've
been working on this program

77
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:46,167
all morning.

78
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:54,067
I want property
tracking on N1708A, now.

79
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,233
Yes sir.

00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,200

81
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:02,533

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,867
Hey, Monica, you
need some help?

88
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:53,767
Hi Michael.

89
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:54,967
No thanks, I can manage.

90
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:55,867
How's things?

91
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,133
Good, I can't complain.

92
00:11:57,233 --> 00:11:59,000
Even if I did, nobody
would listen to me.

93
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,567
Aren't you up here
a little early?

94
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:02,367
You know hunting season doesn't
start for another three weeks.

95
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:05,133
Yeah, well I figured I'd get
a head start on some cleaning.

96
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,733
Besides, I promised
Billings and Freddie I'd

97
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:07,967
come up early this season.

98
00:12:08,067 --> 00:12:09,133
Do they know you're here?

99
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:11,300
They always know
when I'm here.

100
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,867
I never could figure that out.

101
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,933
Would you like a cup of coffee?

102
00:12:15,033 --> 00:12:16,300
I'd love one, thank you.

103
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,067
I'll be damned.

104
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:29,867
[music playing]

105
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:33,500
Monica, I think you've
got some company.

108
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:51,467
Freddie!

109
00:12:58,967 --> 00:12:59,933
Good to see you again, Mike.

110
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:00,833
Billings!

111
00:13:00,933 --> 00:13:02,267
Hello Freddie.

112
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:04,067
Don't you hello Freddie me.

113
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,400
OK, what did I
do wrong this time?

114
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,400
It ain't what you did,
it's what you didn't do.

115
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,200
What?

116
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,767
Signs, mister, that's what.

117
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:13,267
You promised to post
those no hunting

118
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:16,100
signs near our property, and
you haven't posted one yet.

119
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,067
Just take it easy, Freddie,
I made you a promise,

120
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,533
and I'll keep that promise.

121
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,067
Come on inside for
a second, Freddie.

122
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,533
I've got a surprise for you.

123
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:27,033
You'll have to
excuse Freddie, Mike.

124
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:28,767
He hasn't had anyone to
yell at all winter but me.

125
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,133
Oh, that's all right.

126
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:31,233
If he wouldn't yell at
me, I'd think the old kook

127
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,733
was coming down with something.

128
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:37,967
Look Billings, Monica just
bought old Freddie a new hat.

129
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,000
Ain't she sweet?

130
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,533
She sure is, Freddie.

131
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:42,100
I've got some fresh
coffee on the stove,

132
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,467
why don't I cook up some
ham and eggs for you fellas?

133
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,600
That sounds good to me.

134
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,733
Sounds great.

135
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:48,867
How about you,
Mike, breakfast?

136
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:51,067
Oh, I'd love to
baby, but I've got

137
00:13:51,167 --> 00:13:52,700
a million and one things to do.

138
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Y'all have a good day.

139
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,700
Take care of yourself.

140
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,700
I do hope one of those
you've got to do today

141
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,267
is hanging them signs.

142
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:09,233
[printing]

143
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,200
Mr. Quill?

144
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:20,967
Leo.

145
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,033
Come with me, please.

146
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,300
You're probably
wondering by now, Leo,

147
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,500
why a company like Defsat
would spend such a large amount

148
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,867
of money to hire a man with
your particular experience

149
00:14:37,967 --> 00:14:40,133
to do simple security tasks.

150
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,833
It's crossed my mind.

151
00:14:41,933 --> 00:14:44,167
Well it's very simple.

152
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:46,100
We've been anticipating
an event that seems

153
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,133
to have finally transpired.

154
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,433
As you already know,
Defsat Corporation

155
00:14:51,533 --> 00:14:54,067
holds all the contracts
for the research

156
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:56,533
and development of the
Star Wars defense system.

157
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:58,567
These contracts are
due to the efforts

158
00:14:58,667 --> 00:15:00,533
of one man, Charles Biggums.

159
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,100
Two years ago, somebody
attempted to assassinate

160
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,167
Biggums, he obviously escaped.

161
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:08,967
Now our problem is that no one
has seen him or the designs

162
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,333
since.

163
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:13,367
Do you think he's in
less than friendly hands?

164
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,833
No, but I made the decision
to keep his disappearance

165
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:18,333
extremely confidential.

166
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:19,900
So nobody knows he's missing?

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,033
No one.

168
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:22,367
If his disappearance
was made public,

169
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,067
it would mean the end of Defsat.

170
00:15:24,167 --> 00:15:25,600
And I won't let that happen.

171
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,800
What's the situation?

172
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,800
We finally located
the computer disk

173
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,600
containing Biggums' designs.

174
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,500
I need you to get them, no
matter what the expense.

175
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,100
Do you have any idea what
I should expect to find?

176
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,267
This is all the
information you will need.

177
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:54,467
Yes sir, that was a
fine breakfast, Monica.

178
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,600
I'm glad you
enjoyed it, Freddie.

179
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,867
Any time.

180
00:15:57,967 --> 00:16:00,267
You know it's important
for a man of my age

181
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:03,500
to get a proper meal,
once in a while.

182
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
You complaining about
my cooking again, Freddie?

183
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,233
Well, not exactly.

184
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,767
Well, maybe if you
ask Monica real nice,

185
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:12,000
she'll come up tomorrow
night, cook us some dinner.

186
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
I'd love to.

187
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,533
Tomorrow night it is.

188
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:17,167
Come on, Billings,
let's get a move on.

189
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,367
I'm going to shoot
us a wild turkey

190
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:19,900
for tomorrow night's dinner.

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,033
[laughing]

192
00:16:21,933 --> 00:16:22,733
Tomorrow night.

193
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:33,167
I hope these nights feel as
well as they did last year.

194
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:34,333
I'm sure they will, Freddie.

195
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,033
[ominous music playing]

196
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,933
Senator, it's time we started
heading back to our designated

197
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,367
security area.

198
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, the deer
don't know that.

199
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,600
And I'll be damned if I'm
given up a twelve point

200
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,367
buck for security.

201
00:17:16,467 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes sir, we understand,
but we do have certain safety

202
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,833
precautions to think about.

203
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,167
Then you think about them.

204
00:17:22,267 --> 00:17:24,067
I'm gonna get that buck.

205
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,233
[arrow shooting]

206
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,600
[choking]

207
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,100
[typing]

208
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,033
[beeping]

209
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:45,000
Hey, where's my artillery?

210
00:18:01,233 --> 00:18:03,133
Time you showed me the money.

211
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:07,800
Well, we got a
problem about that.

212
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,000
Shit happens.

213
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,200
Guns are expensive.

214
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,667
Firing pins are cheap.

215
00:18:14,767 --> 00:18:15,667
[gunshots]

216
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:19,600
[laughing]

217
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,567
You tell them that
if they want to hit me,

218
00:18:34,667 --> 00:18:38,400
they'd better send a
professional next time, hm?

219
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,333
[grunting]

220
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,367
I'll tell 'em myself.

221
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:58,300
[grunting]

222
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:07,267
[explosion]

223
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:17,433
You got the money?

224
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,833
Yeah.

225
00:19:19,933 --> 00:19:23,433
Good girl.

226
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,433
[screaming]

227
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:55,200
Police!

228
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,367
I didn't do nothing!

229
00:19:57,467 --> 00:19:58,367
Shut up!

230
00:20:04,867 --> 00:20:07,800
Not bad.

231
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,100
This'll get a pretty good price.

232
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,767
What kind of cop are you?

233
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:11,667
A bad cop.

234
00:20:11,767 --> 00:20:13,233
[gunshot]

235
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:53,700
Good morning.

236
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,600
Morning.

237
00:20:57,933 --> 00:21:02,633
It looks like the beginning
of a beautiful day, doesn't it?

238
00:21:02,733 --> 00:21:04,333
Can I help you.

239
00:21:04,433 --> 00:21:05,933
Well, that all depends
on how well you know

240
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,467
these mountains around here.

241
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,967
I'm familiar
with certain areas.

242
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,967
What area are you looking for?

243
00:21:13,067 --> 00:21:15,133
I'm looking for an area
called Dark Water Canyon.

244
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,600
We were told it's ideal for
the type of hunting we do.

245
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,533
Are you familiar with it?

246
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:22,167
Yes I am.

247
00:21:22,267 --> 00:21:24,633
You cross that
mountain over there,

248
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:30,633
points yourself south, and
travel six, maybe seven miles.

249
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:31,900
Thank you.

250
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,433
Whoever told you about
Dark Water Canyon forgot

251
00:21:34,533 --> 00:21:35,967
to tell you that
hunting season doesn't

252
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,867
start for another three weeks.

253
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:40,300
Three weeks, is that right?

254
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,767
Well, we, wouldn't want to
break any laws, would we?

255
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,533
We'll just take in some of
the sights, thanks again.

256
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:10,433
Shit Leo, how much
further do we have to go?

257
00:22:10,533 --> 00:22:12,367
What do you got, a
lunch date with somebody?

258
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,600
Stop breaking my
balls, will you?

259
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,800
Edwards, we still going south?

260
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,233
Still going south, Leo.

261
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:21,200
You think that
bitch lied to us?

262
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,933
If she did, I'll
cut her throat.

263
00:22:23,033 --> 00:22:25,833
Look, she said six or seven
miles, we've only walked about,

264
00:22:25,933 --> 00:22:27,533
what, five?

265
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,433
Well, we're not getting any
closer sitting on our asses.

266
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:31,333
Let's go.

267
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:07,933
Leo, over here.

268
00:23:08,033 --> 00:23:09,100
Looks like somebody
beat us to it,

269
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,367
there's footprints
all over the place.

270
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:14,200
Now what?

271
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,900
You find out where
these tracks are leading

272
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,533
to, you search the plane.

273
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,867
[gunshots]

274
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:38,100
What is it?

275
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,367
Snake, big one.

276
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,167
Relax!

277
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:46,767
Everything's all right.

278
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,667
Just search the fucking plane.

279
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:50,933
Leo!

280
00:23:51,033 --> 00:23:52,533
These tracks lead to
the top of the crevasse.

281
00:23:52,633 --> 00:23:54,733
Nothing, a first
aid kit and a blanket.

282
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,833
Shit.

283
00:23:56,933 --> 00:23:58,233
Edwards!

284
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:02,067
You take Peterson and O'Neil
and follow those tracks.

285
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,167
Check the bodies, see
if there's some ID.

286
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:05,467
I'm not touching that asshole.

287
00:24:05,567 --> 00:24:07,700
You work for me,
you do as you're told.

288
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,067
Now do it.

289
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:13,833
[music playing]

290
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:14,800
Well?

291
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,733
I'm looking, all right?

292
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:26,600
Bingo, let's go.

293
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,867
Hello?

294
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:39,800
Hello?

295
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,300
[gunshots]

296
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,700
Don't shoot!

297
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,433
You could have killed me.

298
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:53,700
No shit, sit down.

299
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,067
You alone?

300
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,567
Were those your tracks
back at the plane?

301
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:58,500
What's your name?

302
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,767
Who are you guys?

303
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,100
Answer the questions.

304
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:04,567
What is this?

305
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,000
I told you guys to
follow the tracks.

306
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,200
We did, they belong to him.

307
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,267
Careful, Leo, he looks
a little dangerous.

308
00:25:15,367 --> 00:25:19,000
If you say my name once more,
I'm gonna blow your face off.

309
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,067
Sorry.

310
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:27,900
Did you find a
plane back there?

311
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,067
Yes, sir.

312
00:25:30,167 --> 00:25:35,267
Now, this next question
is very important.

313
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,067
And if I think
you're lying to me,

314
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:41,700
I'm going to have that man
put a bullet in your head.

315
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,300
Do you understand?

316
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,233
Yes, sir.

317
00:25:45,333 --> 00:25:47,033
Good.

318
00:25:47,133 --> 00:25:50,067
Did you take anything
from that plane?

319
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,933
No, sir.

320
00:25:52,033 --> 00:25:55,167
The little bastards lying.

321
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:58,600
Boy Scouts don't lie, do they?

322
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,467
No, sir.

323
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:03,000
I didn't think so.

324
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,033
How much time's
left before dark?

325
00:26:05,133 --> 00:26:07,933
About four hours.

326
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,500
OK.

327
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,967
You four stay here,
you come with me.

328
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:14,433
What's happening?

329
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,033
We're going back to
the car and report in,

330
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:18,767
we'll be back in the morning.

331
00:26:18,867 --> 00:26:20,333
Morning?

332
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:22,333
We'll freeze to death out here
without sleeping bags and shit.

333
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:23,600
He's right.

334
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,133
Hey, you've got a Boy Scout.

335
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,967
Have him build you a fire.

336
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:28,067
[laughing]

337
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,133
What an asshole.

338
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,300
Mm-hmm.

339
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:47,500
You're up to your ass in
it this time, Billings,

340
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,433
and you know it.

341
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,967
There's an old Taoist saying,
Freddie, that attention centers

342
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:57,267
not on things in
their state of being,

343
00:26:57,367 --> 00:27:00,067
but upon their
movements and change.

344
00:27:00,167 --> 00:27:01,000
Horse shit.

345
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,467
Check mate.

346
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,800
What?

347
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,367
You're a back shooter, Billings.

348
00:27:07,467 --> 00:27:10,000
That's what you did, I
left my back door open,

349
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,433
you shot me right in the back.

350
00:27:16,967 --> 00:27:18,233
Mmm, you smell great.

351
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,000
Oh?

352
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,367
Mm-hm.

353
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,067
Your cooking smells good, too.

354
00:27:22,167 --> 00:27:23,900
Two out of three isn't bad.

355
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,867
What's number three?

356
00:27:25,967 --> 00:27:27,133
You'll find out later.

357
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,367
Now if you don't
stop kissing my neck,

358
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,433
dinner is never
going to be ready.

359
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,167
Why don't you go in there and
cut up those vegetables for me.

360
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:36,400
That should keep those hands
of yours busy for a while.

361
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,800
That's a lot of
vegetables for three people.

362
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,633
Oh I forgot, I'm sorry, John.

363
00:27:43,733 --> 00:27:45,067
What?

364
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:47,133
I invited Mike up to
dinner, I hope you don't mind.

365
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:48,600
- No, not at all.
- Are you sure?

366
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,767
I should have asked you and
Freddie first, I'm sorry.

367
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:51,733
Don't be silly.

368
00:27:51,833 --> 00:27:53,533
Mike's welcome here any time.

369
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,400
What time did he say
he's going to be here?

370
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:59,200
Well, he said he'd be up
after he finished posting his no

371
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,933
hunting signs for Freddie.

372
00:28:02,033 --> 00:28:04,100
Unless he went over
to Dark Water Canyon.

373
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,233
What would he go down
to Dark Water Canyon for?

374
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:09,367
I called Mike this morning
about a group of strange men

375
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:11,333
I talked to that wanted
to do some hunting up

376
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:12,700
around Dark Water Canyon.

377
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,700
When I told them hunting
season hadn't started yet,

378
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,700
they went up anyway.

379
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,567
What do you mean by strange?

380
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:21,367
I don't know, I guess
the way they acted.

381
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,600
They had a real
city way about them.

382
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,967
One of them had a
.45 under his jacket.

383
00:28:26,067 --> 00:28:27,867
I mean, what do you
hunt with a .45?

384
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,400
[music playing]

385
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,567
Hey Boy Scout, you got
food in that pack of yours?

386
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:00,367
Yeah.

387
00:29:00,467 --> 00:29:03,233
Well fix us something to eat.

388
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,333
You got a problem with that?

389
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,533
[unzipping]

390
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,633
Hey I'm freezing
my ass off over here.

391
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:24,133
Put some more wood in the fire.

392
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,633
Man what I can do with
a nice porterhouse

393
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:44,667
steak, a baked potato,
and a cold beer right now.

394
00:29:44,767 --> 00:29:46,800
Hey shut up, will you?

395
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,267
Hurry up with that food.

396
00:29:48,367 --> 00:29:51,367
You know I remember once
eating nothing but rat meat

397
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:54,000
and cold rice for
three months straight.

398
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,700
Why?

399
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,967
I was a POW in Vietnam.

400
00:30:01,067 --> 00:30:02,533
[cocks gun]

401
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,133
You ever eat a rat, boy?

402
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:09,333
You ever eat a rat, boy?

403
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,333
No, sir.

404
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,500
Hey Boy Scout.

405
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,733
What brings you up in
these woods, anyway.

406
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,133
I'm working on a badge.

407
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,467
What kind of badge?

408
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,400
Survival batch.

409
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,800
It's called the
Order of the Eagle.

410
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,500
I was a Cub Scout once.

411
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,900
I got kicked out,
for eating a brownie.

412
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,033
[laughing]

413
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:38,933
Now that's good
one, I like that one.

414
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,300
Huh?

415
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,367
You get it, for
eating a brownie.

416
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,300
[laughing]

417
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,067
MIKE: Hello?

418
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,967
Hello out there.

419
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,900
Put 'em down, put 'em down!

420
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,233
Relax.

421
00:30:54,333 --> 00:30:57,067
One word out of you, and I'll
blow your fucking brains out,

422
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,167
understand?

423
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,233
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

424
00:31:11,433 --> 00:31:13,267
Been up here doing
a little hunting?

425
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,233
No, no.

426
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,933
Just doing a little
camping, Ranger.

427
00:31:17,033 --> 00:31:19,133
Mm.

428
00:31:19,233 --> 00:31:21,400
You know there's
no camping up here,

429
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,567
and that mean no campfire,
so put out your fire.

430
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,633
What's your name, son?

431
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:29,600
GREG: Greg, sir.

432
00:31:32,933 --> 00:31:34,300
You all right, son?

433
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,767
Get lost.

434
00:31:35,867 --> 00:31:37,533
What did you say?

435
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:39,200
I said get lost.

436
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,833
Turn around when
you talk to me.

437
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,633
I said, turn around!

438
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:44,633
[gunshots]

439
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,000
[music playing]

440
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,533
My fucking leg!

441
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,200
You stupid son of a bitch.

442
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,167
[gunshot]

443
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,133
[gunshots]

444
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,500
[gunshots]

445
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Oh!

446
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:19,533
- You see which way he went?
- No.

447
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,033
Go to the left,
you take the right.

448
00:32:41,067 --> 00:32:42,067
Fuck.

449
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:46,467
[thud]

450
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,533
[gunshots]

451
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,867
Got a hit.

452
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:45,800
Logan!

453
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,800
Logan!

454
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,333
Hey, what are you, deaf?

455
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,700
[punch]

456
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,700
[thud]

457
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,733
LEO: (ON PHONE) Yes
sir, we found the plane.

458
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:15,900
Biggums is dead.

459
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,067
We didn't find
anything in the plane,

460
00:34:18,167 --> 00:34:20,667
but I have reason to believe
that the Boy Scout did it.

461
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,033
I see.

462
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:24,200
Well, that's not
very good is it?

463
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,467
Where's the Boy Scout now?

464
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,067
LEO: (ON PHONE) He's
with the rest of my men.

465
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,333
He's not going anywhere.

466
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,867
Good, see that he doesn't.

467
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,800
Now here are your instructions.

468
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,700
You are to be at the pickup
location in the morning.

469
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,900
I will have a man by the name
of Jack LaRouse flown in,

470
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,033
you will take him to the
wreckage, at which point

471
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,767
he will take over the operation.

472
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,267
Is that clear?

473
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:45,300
LEO: (ON PHONE) Yes, sir.

474
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,033
Oh, by the way
Leo, Mr. LaRouse

475
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:53,133
is to have full cooperation
from you and your men.

476
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:54,667
Am I understood?

477
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:56,933
LEO: (ON PHONE) Yes sir,
everything's under control.

478
00:34:57,033 --> 00:34:58,000
Good.

479
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,233
I'm starving my ass
off, standing out here.

480
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:19,933
Are you sure there was no
one left in that trading post?

481
00:35:20,033 --> 00:35:21,933
I'm positive.

482
00:35:22,033 --> 00:35:25,333
[airplane approaching]

483
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:28,067
Well it's about fucking time.

484
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,333
[music playing]

485
00:36:02,467 --> 00:36:03,300
Jack, Leo.

486
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:17,700
I--

487
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,333
You'll have to
excuse my tracker,

488
00:36:36,433 --> 00:36:38,267
he's not much of a
conversationalist.

489
00:36:38,367 --> 00:36:39,233
I'll say.

490
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,633
Are you Jack LaRouse?

491
00:36:40,733 --> 00:36:43,300
Why, is someone else
getting off the airplane?

492
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,467
I'm Leo, this is O'Neil.

493
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:47,867
Pleasure.

494
00:36:47,967 --> 00:36:50,600
Excuse me, will you?

495
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,667
You won't forget what we
discussed about the pickup,

496
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:53,600
will you?

497
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,533
Well, let's get on
with it, shall we?

498
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:03,600
Jack, you might want to
know where we're going.

499
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,667
Why?

500
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,300
My track seems to know already.

501
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:16,167
Don't look at me.

502
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:36,067
[birds chirping]

503
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:37,800
Well, good morning.

504
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,033
Welcome back to the living.

505
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,200
Where am I?

506
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,600
Never mind where
you are right now,

507
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,500
let's just take a look
at that head of yours.

508
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,667
You know, you remind me of
a little dog I once found,

509
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,700
that had been beaten so much,
that when you tried to pet it,

510
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,467
it tried to bite your hand off.

511
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:01,100
I think a proper
introduction is needed here.

512
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm Freddie.

513
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,200
Greg.

514
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,667
Now that wasn't
so bad, was it?

515
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,367
Let's see what we got here.

516
00:38:10,467 --> 00:38:11,167
Ah.

517
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:12,933
Easy does it, now.

518
00:38:13,033 --> 00:38:14,933
Old Freddie ain't ate
a young boy like you

519
00:38:15,033 --> 00:38:17,300
for breakfast in a long time.

520
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,233
[laughing]

521
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,900
GREG: How bad is it?

522
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,267
Well, let's put it this way.

523
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,600
It ain't nothing a good
old breakfast won't fix.

524
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:30,233
You get some rest,
while Freddie sees

525
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:31,700
about rustling up some grub.

526
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,833
Freddie?

527
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:37,733
Yeah.

528
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:38,867
Thanks.

529
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:41,233
Shit, save you
thanks for Billings,

530
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:42,767
he was the one that got
you out of that rash

531
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:44,800
of shit last night.

532
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,767
[monica humming]

533
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,700
Oh, you're up.
Good morning.

534
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,133
Morning.

535
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:27,400
So you're the one who
spoiled my dinner last night.

536
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,100
- Sorry.
- It's OK, I'm only teasing.

537
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,367
Hi, I'm Monica.

538
00:39:31,467 --> 00:39:32,333
I'm-- I'm Greg.

539
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,267
Do you know where
my clothes are?

540
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:40,167
Well, yeah, your pants and
your shoes are right here.

541
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:42,600
I'm afraid your shirt had
quite a bit of blood on it,

542
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,067
but I can get that out.

543
00:39:44,167 --> 00:39:46,267
I can find you an old t-shirt
to wear in the meantime.

544
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,067
OK.

545
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,067
Don't worry, I didn't
undress you, Freddie did.

546
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:55,467
Thank you.

547
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,200
You're welcome.

548
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
I'll get you a t-shirt.

549
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,700
[laughing]

550
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,867
O'NEIL: (VOICEOVER) You alone?

551
00:40:10,967 --> 00:40:11,967
You alone?

552
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:13,067
Are those your
tracks back there?

553
00:40:13,167 --> 00:40:14,767
Just answer that questions.

554
00:40:14,867 --> 00:40:16,500
Are those your
tracks back there?

555
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,533
LEO: (VOICEOVER) Now this next
question is very important.

556
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:22,700
And if I think
you're lying to me,

557
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:26,267
I'm going to have this man
put a bullet in your head.

558
00:40:26,367 --> 00:40:28,933
MONICA: I found an old
t-shirt of Freddie's for you.

559
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:30,200
Greg?

560
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,100
Greg?

561
00:40:33,867 --> 00:40:36,633
Freddie, run and
get Billings, quick.

562
00:40:36,733 --> 00:40:39,300
Hey, I think you
better get back in here.

563
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,500
He's just been
standing there, staring.

564
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,400
Let me have some
time with him.

565
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,700
Here, come on, Freddie,
let's go get breakfast.

566
00:40:58,367 --> 00:40:59,733
- They killed him.
- Who?

567
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:00,900
The Ranger, they killed him.

568
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,067
OK, relax.

569
00:41:02,167 --> 00:41:03,367
No, you don't understand.

570
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,133
If they find me, they're
going to kill me too.

571
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:06,967
I should have never taken
that stupid briefcase

572
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:07,967
from that plane.

573
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,767
We've got to call the police.

574
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:10,667
There's no phones here.

575
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:11,867
What?

576
00:41:11,967 --> 00:41:12,900
I got to get out of here.
- Take it--

577
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,700
No, I got to go!
Let me go!

578
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,433
Listen to me!

579
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:18,067
Running around in an
area that you don't know

580
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,667
isn't the smartest thing
to do right now, is it?

581
00:41:20,767 --> 00:41:22,100
Is it?

582
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,367
No, but if they find me,
they're going to kill me.

583
00:41:23,467 --> 00:41:24,200
Hey!

584
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,700
Who saved your ass last night?

585
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,967
You did.

586
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,367
Yeah.

587
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,400
And I'm not about to let
anything happen to you now.

588
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,300
OK?

589
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,667
Why don't you tell
me how you got

590
00:41:39,767 --> 00:41:40,867
yourself into all this trouble.

591
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:41,767
Come on.

592
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:55,900
While you're over there,
loosen that tourniquet.

593
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,533
What do I look like, a nurse?

594
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:01,167
What's so funny?

595
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:03,867
The look on Leo's face
when you tell him a Boy Scout

596
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:05,267
took us down.

597
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:07,033
You got a real stupid sense
of humor, you know that?

598
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,733
Hello Greg, have a seat.

599
00:42:17,833 --> 00:42:20,367
I hope you like eggs.

600
00:42:20,467 --> 00:42:22,100
How would you like your
eggs this morning, John?

601
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,600
Oh, I won't be eating
this morning, thanks.

602
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,567
I'll be back in a while.

603
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:31,467
Would it be too much for
me to ask where you're going?

604
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,100
Yes, it would.

605
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,367
Can I expect you for lunch?

606
00:42:34,467 --> 00:42:35,267
You bet.

607
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:36,267
Come on.

608
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,233
Excuse me.

609
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,067
Billings.

610
00:42:49,167 --> 00:42:50,133
Look, Freddie.

611
00:42:50,233 --> 00:42:51,500
Look, Freddie, my ass.

612
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,067
Where the hell you get
off leaving me in the dark

613
00:42:53,167 --> 00:42:54,333
when there's trouble?

614
00:42:54,433 --> 00:42:56,400
There's no time to
explain right now.

615
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,667
Bullshit.

616
00:42:57,767 --> 00:42:59,900
Either you tell me, or I'm
going in and getting my gun

617
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,100
and go with you.

618
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,333
All right.

619
00:43:02,433 --> 00:43:03,533
The men that were
after Greg last night

620
00:43:03,633 --> 00:43:04,367
may still be out there.

621
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:05,433
I want to know where they are.

622
00:43:05,533 --> 00:43:06,767
I need you here.

623
00:43:06,867 --> 00:43:09,667
Have a gun ready, just be ready
to move out if we have to.

624
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:14,067
You get your ass back here in
one piece, do you understand?

625
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,467
I plan to.

626
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:57,333
[music playing]

627
00:43:58,167 --> 00:43:59,300
[beeping]

628
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,133
Come on.

629
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,700
Did you hear that?

630
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,600
What?

631
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,267
It better be Leo.

632
00:45:32,367 --> 00:45:34,133
Maybe it's that Boy
Scout, come back to get us.

633
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,633
Relax, it's him.

634
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,667
What the fuck happened to him?

635
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:49,200
Where's the boy?

636
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,033
He got away last night.

637
00:45:54,133 --> 00:45:56,667
He what?

638
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:59,233
Excuse me.

639
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:00,600
It wasn't our fault, Leo.

640
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,833
A ranger showed up to
the campsite last night,

641
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,467
he had to be dealt with.

642
00:46:04,567 --> 00:46:07,833
Bastard tried to kill
Johnson, so I shot him.

643
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:09,267
That's when the kid got away.

644
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,233
And just like that,
you let him get away.

645
00:46:11,333 --> 00:46:12,667
We ran after him
all right, but there

646
00:46:12,767 --> 00:46:14,367
was somebody out there waiting.

647
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:15,700
What the fuck is
he talking about?

648
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:17,067
It's no bullshit, Leo.

649
00:46:17,167 --> 00:46:18,500
Whoever they were, they
tore into us like a shark.

650
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,500
Yeah but the kid isn't
going to get far on his own,

651
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,667
we found blood.

652
00:46:21,767 --> 00:46:22,700
It was a definite hit.

653
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,200
This is great.

654
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,300
Leo, you are certain
this is the scientist.

655
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,933
Yeah, it's him, all right.

656
00:46:29,033 --> 00:46:31,033
I've got his ID in my pocket.

657
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:32,300
Who is this guy, Leo?

658
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,533
My name is Jack
LaRouse, and I'm taking

659
00:46:37,633 --> 00:46:39,400
charge of this operation.

660
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,100
From here on, you will be taking
your instructions from me.

661
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,167
Is that clear?

662
00:46:44,267 --> 00:46:46,033
Is that right, Leo?

663
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:48,133
That's what the
man said, isn't it?

664
00:46:48,233 --> 00:46:50,233
And now, if you'll
be so kind as to

665
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,667
show me where it was
that you lost the boy.

666
00:46:55,233 --> 00:46:58,467
You think you can make
it back to the cabin?

667
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,200
I think so.

668
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,700
Well, tell Freddie
and Monica to get

669
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,900
everything ready, because
they're gonna have to move out.

670
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,233
All right?
- OK.

671
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,167
Go.

672
00:47:09,067 --> 00:47:10,533
[music playing]

673
00:47:22,867 --> 00:47:24,100
What are we gonna
do with Johnson?

674
00:47:27,667 --> 00:47:29,867
My tracker will see to it
that he's made comfortable.

675
00:47:29,967 --> 00:47:32,433
We'll pick him up
on our way back.

676
00:47:32,533 --> 00:47:36,667
Get me out of these
fucking mountains.

677
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,667
It won't be long.

678
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,100
Logan, you lead the way.

679
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:33,300
[grunting]

680
00:48:45,467 --> 00:48:47,767
This is where we
lost sight of them.

681
00:48:47,867 --> 00:48:49,900
So you got a hit?

682
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,100
We did.

683
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,533
There's more leading
in that direction.

684
00:48:52,633 --> 00:48:54,767
And where was it that you
were attacked last night?

685
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:57,867
About 25 yards over there.

686
00:48:57,967 --> 00:49:00,233
Edwards went right, I went left.

689
00:49:17,167 --> 00:49:18,133
Where's Billings?

690
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:19,400
He's watching those men.

691
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:20,767
I'll get my gun and
you show me where he is.

692
00:49:20,867 --> 00:49:22,733
No, he told us to pack
up and get ready to move.

693
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:23,667
Damn.

694
00:49:23,767 --> 00:49:26,600
What's going on?

695
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,100
Billings wants us to pack up.

696
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,700
That bad, huh?

697
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,367
I guess so.

698
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:36,733
Here, I got the blood
out and it's almost dry.

699
00:49:36,833 --> 00:49:39,000
Thank you.

700
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,033
No, that's OK, you keep it.

701
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:42,600
You might need it.

702
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,900
Monica, you get the packs, and
I'll get my gun from the shed.

703
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,600
OK.

shells from the mount.

705

How many do you
think there were?

Couldn't have been
more than three.

708
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,100

No, they're Billings', they
were given to him in Vietnam.

713

story another time.

that included the three

of you and the Boy Scout.

one guy's gonna take us out.

It's quite obvious,
Mr. Logan, that you

723
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:33,667
are not qualified to make
that affirmation, now are you?

724
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,200
Are you sure he's
not making a mistake?

725
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:47,067
A mistake has already
been made, last night, Leo.

726
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:49,300
All right.

727
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,600
I don't want to
discuss this anymore.

728
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:54,133
Let's just find the kid,
and get this shit over with.

729
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,633
I believe it's this way.

730
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,233
Freddie?

731
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:07,267
Why do you think Billings
come up here to live?

732
00:52:07,367 --> 00:52:10,267
To get away from
all the bullshit.

733
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,267
See Greg, up here
you ain't got nobody

734
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:16,067
to answer to but yourself.

735
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:19,867
Down there, you got a
whole world of assholes,

736
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:24,900
trying to tell you what to do,
how to do it, when to do it.

737
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,433
And if you don't do it,
you ain't got the rent.

738
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:32,833
Living like that will make
you old before you die,

739
00:52:32,933 --> 00:52:34,833
and that's a fact.

740
00:52:34,933 --> 00:52:37,433
You listen to old Freddie.

741
00:52:37,533 --> 00:52:39,000
[music playing]

742
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,967
You and Billings been
friends a long time, huh?

743
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:51,200
Billings and my boy used
to raise hell together

744
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,100
when they were teenagers.

745
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,400
Where's your boy now?

746
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,600
Dead.

747
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:04,067
Died in some rice paddy,
that lousy Asian war.

748
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:08,867
Billings is the one that
brought my boy's body home.

749
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:11,533
Never forget the
day we buried him--

750
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:16,533
cold, raining, and Billings
standing there with his uniform

751
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:21,667
on, three Purple Hearts.

752
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:23,067
He was a hero, huh?

753
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,500
Yes he was.

754
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,467
Captured three times,
escaped three times.

755
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:35,400
Freddie, he's been
gone a long time.

756
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:37,567
Don't you worry
about Billings.

757
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:40,067
MIKE: Canteen's full and
I'm working on a pack.

758
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:41,267
You a good shot?

759
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:49,600
[gunshot]

760
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,167
[music playing]

761
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,767
Freddie, Billings is back!

762
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,867
What's happening?

763
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,000
We're getting the hell out
of here, is what's happening.

764
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,100
Where we going to?

765
00:54:24,533 --> 00:54:26,600
You know those big rocks
we found last spring?

766
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,300
The ones by the lake?

767
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,300
I want the three of you to
go over there and wait for me.

768
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,267
What are you planning to do?

769
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,700
I've got to buy a little time.

770
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,600
I don't suppose you'd
want me to go with you.

771
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,800
I do not.

772
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:36,800
I didn't think so.

773
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:37,733
Ya!

774
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,667
How much did you pack?

775
00:54:38,767 --> 00:54:39,967
Enough for three days.

776
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:40,900
You want me to pack more?

777
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,200
No, I don't have time.

778
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,933
OK.

779
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:47,600
If we need food, I can
catch rabbits with this.

780
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:49,267
Can I stay and help?

781
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:51,233
No, I'll be there soon enough.

782
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:54,133
Well, Greg, let's
get a shake on.

783
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,500
I'll see you soon?

784
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,967
Yeah.

785
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:07,067
Go.

786
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,667
That, gentlemen, is
your night stalker.

787
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,133
Let's see how he
does during the day.

788
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,100
Excuse me.

789
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,767
I was hoping perhaps
that you could help us.

790
00:56:27,667 --> 00:56:30,067
Depends on what it is.

791
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:31,533
First off, let me
introduce myself.

792
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:33,600
I'm Jack LaRouse, you are?

793
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,467
John Billings.

794
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:36,400
We've already met.

795
00:56:39,067 --> 00:56:40,533
I believe we have.

796
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:45,067
Lower That rifle,
mister, or use it.

797
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:46,700
There's no need for
that, Mr. Peterson,

798
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,800
I think Mr. Billings understands
the potential of the situation.

799
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,133
Now then, if you'd be so kind
as to tell us the whereabouts

800
00:56:57,233 --> 00:56:59,100
of the Boy Scout?

801
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,800
Sent him in that
direction on a horse.

802
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:07,567
That wasn't very good
of you, Mr. Billings.

803
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:09,567
Well, it seemed like the
thing to do at the time.

804
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:17,733
If you'll excuse me,
I've got some work to do.

805
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,300
You're gonna let him
walk away like that?

806
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:36,500
Relax Mr. Peterson,
everything is under control.

807
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,833
Mr. Billings!

808
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:45,467
Jack, what the
hell is going on?

809
00:57:45,567 --> 00:57:48,600
Leo, would you bring Mr.
Billings back outside please?

810
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,633
O'Neil.

811
00:58:17,667 --> 00:58:18,567
[crashing]

812

814

[gunshots]

815
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:35,567
[cocking gun]

816
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,867
He's only got a fucking
Winchester, let's rush him.

817
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,267
[gunshot]

818
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:47,233
Splendid idea, Mr.
Edwards, be my guest.

819
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:48,800
We gonna sit around
all day and play

820
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,600
with this asshole or what?

821
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:55,567
We're going rush
this son of a bitch!

822
00:58:55,667 --> 00:58:56,567
Now!

823
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,133
[gunshots]

824
00:59:09,033 --> 00:59:10,533

[gunshots]

826
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:19,500
He went out the back
window, he's got a briefcase!

827
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,100
[gunshots]

828
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:06,033
[grunting]

829
01:00:14,533 --> 01:00:15,433
[groaning]

832

834
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:36,700
[gunshots]

835
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,700
All right, cut it.

836
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,600
Hold your fire, damn it!

837
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:50,233
He's not coming up.

838
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,267
Where the hell is he?

839
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:53,767
He's dead, he's
got to be dead.

840
01:01:53,867 --> 01:01:55,833
Oh, you think so?

841
01:01:55,933 --> 01:01:57,133
This guy don't
got to be nothing.

842
01:01:57,233 --> 01:01:58,933
This is just beautiful, Leo.

843
01:01:59,033 --> 01:02:01,067
No Boy Scout, no
mountain man, nothing.

844
01:02:01,167 --> 01:02:02,700
Not a fucking thing.

845
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,667
JACK LAROUSE: We should
look elsewhere, gentlemen.

846
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:07,733
I really don't think
he'll be coming up here.

847
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:09,967
No shit, Sherlock.

848
01:02:10,067 --> 01:02:11,100
Shut up.

849
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,200
Which way, Jack?

850
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:16,700
Is your bloodhound
still with us?

851
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:18,267
[music playing]

852
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:23,200
Indeed, he is.

853
01:02:29,067 --> 01:02:30,533
Indeed my ass.

854
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:55,133
How long do you think
we'll have to stay here?

855
01:02:55,233 --> 01:02:56,633
Well, that all
depends on what Billings

856
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:59,467
finds out about those men.

857
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,733
We'll be all right.

858
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,733
There's plenty of fresh
water, and enough food to last

859
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:05,367
us for at least three days.

860
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:07,800
If we're lucky, maybe Freddie
will catch some rabbits,

861
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,367
and make us some
of his rabbit stew.

862
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:10,900
Right, Freddie?

863
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,700
He's taking too long.

864
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:16,033
I don't like it.

865
01:03:16,133 --> 01:03:19,633
No sir, not one bit.

866
01:03:19,733 --> 01:03:22,200
Freddie, why don't you come
over here and keep us company?

867
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:23,633
John will be here soon enough.

868
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:24,900
Yeah, come on, Freddie.

869
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,833
He's in trouble,
I can feel it.

870
01:03:28,933 --> 01:03:32,900
And I'm standing like some old
woman watching her laundry dry.

871
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,600
I'm going after him.

872
01:03:34,700 --> 01:03:38,200
Freddie, John told us
to wait here for him.

873
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,433
That's right, Freddie.

874
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:41,667
Well he ain't here.

875
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:47,633
And if he does need
my help, I'm gonna

876
01:03:47,733 --> 01:03:49,233
shoot some son of a bitch.

877
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:52,500
Freddie, don't wander too far.

878
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,200
So stubborn sometimes.

879
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,967
Make me leave
my home, I'll blow

880
01:03:58,067 --> 01:03:59,633
that damn fool's brain's out.

881
01:04:05,067 --> 01:04:06,533
[gunshot]

882
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,800
[gunshot]

883
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:21,467
Show your face, you
silly little bastard.

884
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:24,167
Drop the shotgun, or
I'll blow your brains

885
01:04:24,267 --> 01:04:26,400
all over these woods.

886
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,333
Now.

887
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,167
Somebody's coming.

888
01:04:44,867 --> 01:04:46,300
Where's Freddie?

889
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,367
He went looking for you.

890
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:48,133
He what?

891
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:49,500
I told him to stay here.

892
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:51,133
That's what we told them,
but he wouldn't listen.

893
01:04:51,233 --> 01:04:52,167
You know how he gets.

894
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:53,067
I'll go get him.

895
01:04:53,167 --> 01:04:54,400
No, you stay put.

896
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:56,533
Those men will be combing
this are in no time.

897
01:04:56,633 --> 01:04:58,467
They won't be able
to find us here.

898
01:04:58,567 --> 01:05:00,233
Don't bet on that.

899
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,000
I knew they weren't hunters.

900
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,667
Oh, they're
hunters, all right.

901
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,600
How long's Freddie been gone?

902
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,133
10 minutes.

903
01:05:08,233 --> 01:05:09,800
OK, I'm going to try to go
and find Freddie before they do.

904
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,467
Is there anything I can do?

905
01:05:12,567 --> 01:05:15,300
Yeah, hold onto these,
be ready to move out.

906
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,233
I don't think we're gonna
be staying here very long.

907
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:21,200
[music playing]

908
01:05:24,533 --> 01:05:26,233
I tell you, man, I'm
living up here by myself.

909
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,333
That's not what these
tracks say, old man.

910
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,667
Damn it, Freddie.

911
01:05:44,033 --> 01:05:45,967
He's back.

912
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:46,900
Oh no.

913
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,133
Where's Freddie?

914
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:49,367
- They've got him.
- We've got to save him.

915
01:05:49,467 --> 01:05:50,733
We're not gonna
do it staying here.

916
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:51,800
Leave everything
but the shotguns,

917
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,033
we've got to move
fast, let's go.

918
01:06:12,233 --> 01:06:14,600
Leo, have some of your men
circle out about 70 yards

919
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:17,333
or so, just in case.

920
01:06:17,433 --> 01:06:19,267
Peterson, you and Edwards.

921
01:06:56,467 --> 01:07:00,333
No need, they're not going
anywhere without their friend.

922
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:01,933
Mr. Billings!

923
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:03,633
I know you're watching.

924
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,467
You won't keep us waiting
long, now, will you?

925
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:07,833
How many men do
you see down there?

926
01:07:07,933 --> 01:07:11,200
- Five.
- There were seven before.

927
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,200
Where are the other two?

928
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,167
That's a good question.

929
01:07:16,267 --> 01:07:18,233
How are we going to
get Freddie out of there?

930
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:21,233

 don't know, but it's
not going to be easy.

931
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,933
How fast can you run?

932
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,333
Fast.

933
01:07:25,433 --> 01:07:27,133
Good, because the
Ranger's station

934
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:28,700
is a mile east from here.

935
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,667
I want you and Greg to make a
run for it while I try to get

936
01:07:30,767 --> 01:07:31,867
Freddie out of that cave.

937
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:34,367
So that's what you
were trying to do,

938
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:36,433
you were going to have them
chase us right to the Ranger.

939
01:07:36,533 --> 01:07:39,200
Yeah, well it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

940
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,667
What are you going to do?

941
01:07:40,767 --> 01:07:42,367
I'm gonna see if I can't
draw them out of that cave.

942
01:07:42,467 --> 01:07:44,800
Knock them off one
by one like Rambo?

943
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:46,200
Like who?

944
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:47,700
You know, Rambo.

945
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:49,333
The guy who runs through the
jungle and kills the enemy.

946
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:52,633
There were guys in
Nam like that, right?

947
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:53,600
Yeah.

948
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:55,567
What are they called?

949
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:58,400
Dead.

950
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,933
Well, this ought
to be high enough.

951
01:08:00,033 --> 01:08:01,567
Yeah, I'll stay here.

952
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:03,300
Why don't you go check
some lower ground.

953
01:08:05,733 --> 01:08:07,867
Man, I can't wait to
get back to the city.

954
01:08:07,967 --> 01:08:09,533
Hey, Peterson, you
got an extra clip?

955
01:08:09,633 --> 01:08:11,367
I'm a little low.

956
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:15,433
There's no such
thing as an extra clip.

957
01:08:15,533 --> 01:08:16,933
Thanks, asshole.

958
01:08:17,033 --> 01:08:18,000
Don't mention it.

959
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:31,600
Mr. Billings!

960
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,767
Time is running out!

961
01:08:34,867 --> 01:08:36,567
For every 10
minutes that I wait,

962
01:08:36,667 --> 01:08:41,767
your friend inside will suffer
considerably, starting now!

963
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:48,133
Listen to me, both of you.

964
01:08:48,233 --> 01:08:50,467
I'm gonna run in that direction.

965
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:53,100
When those two men open fire at
me, you'll know where they are.

966
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,433
That's when you run for
the Ranger's, understand?

967
01:08:55,533 --> 01:08:58,667
Now Greg, I want you to stay
a ways back from Monica, that

968
01:08:58,767 --> 01:08:59,700
way you can cover her back, OK?

969
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:00,600
Yeah.

970
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,067
Good.

971
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:05,433
Give me the disks.

972
01:09:05,533 --> 01:09:08,367
Now, Freddie's life
depends on this, you ready?

973
01:09:19,467 --> 01:09:20,800
[music playing]

974
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:27,800

[gunshot]

977
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:03,067
Drop the weapon.

978
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:10,600
Well, if it's not the
trading post lady.

979
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:14,800
Where'd you think
you were going?

980
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:16,367
To get some help, huh?

981
01:10:23,967 --> 01:10:25,467
Are you OK?

982
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:26,367
I'm fine.

983
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:27,267
Run, Greg.

984
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:28,700
Yeah, well, what about you?

985
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,000
There's not enough time, run!

986
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:45,500
You got the guts
to pull that trigger?

987
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:56,233
Don't take another step.

988
01:10:56,333 --> 01:10:58,600
Shotguns are awfully messy.

989
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,533
You pull that trigger,
you're gonna splatter me

990
01:11:01,633 --> 01:11:02,467
all over this forest.

991
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:06,067
You want to see that?

992
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,867
Yeah, I didn't think so.

993
01:11:13,967 --> 01:11:14,867

[gunshots]

997
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,300
Hey Tracker, you want to eat?

998
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:05,000
I've never seen
him eat, nor sleep.

999
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:07,933
He doesn't speak much either.

1000
01:12:08,033 --> 01:12:09,300
I think you'd
find it difficult

1001
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:13,067
talking without a tongue,
don't you think, Leo?

1002
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:14,767
Leo, what time is it?

1003
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:21,000
3:30, why?

1004
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:22,567
Not long before
our pickup time.

1005
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:29,800
Uh, Jack, 10 minutes is up.

1006
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,233
I'm sorry to hear that.

1007
01:12:31,333 --> 01:12:33,133
So what are you going
to do with the old nigger?

1008
01:12:36,567 --> 01:12:39,500
I never cared much
for that expression.

1009
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:45,333
Neither have I.

1010
01:12:45,433 --> 01:12:46,233
My mistake.

1011
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:03,567
Very nice.

1012
01:13:03,667 --> 01:13:06,133
Very nice, indeed.

1013
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:07,767
Where did you get it?

1014
01:13:07,867 --> 01:13:10,433
I made it.

1015
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:12,333
I commend you on
your craftsmanship.

1016
01:13:15,367 --> 01:13:17,300
I, too, am an admirer
of the cutlery weapons.

1017
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:26,633
Do you like it, Freddie?

1018
01:13:26,733 --> 01:13:28,067
No.

1019
01:13:28,167 --> 01:13:33,233
Seems that your friends
don't care that much about you,

1020
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:34,633
do they?

1021
01:13:34,733 --> 01:13:36,167
[groaning]

1022
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,367
Hang in there, Freddie.

[grunting]

1025
01:13:55,133 --> 01:13:56,733
Is the old man dead?

1026
01:13:56,833 --> 01:13:58,433
Is that a conscience I hear?

1027
01:13:59,933 --> 01:14:02,600
No, I was just wondering how
our ace in the hole was doing,

1028
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,333
that's all.

1029
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:05,967
The pilot's on
the walkie talkie,

1030
01:14:06,067 --> 01:14:07,933
he wants to know the
location of the pickup.

1031
01:14:08,033 --> 01:14:09,100
Thank you.

1032
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:36,000

[groaning]

1035
01:16:48,533 --> 01:16:50,833
Are you ready for
another session, Freddie?

1036
01:16:50,933 --> 01:16:52,567
LOGAN: This is a bunch
of bullshit, Leo.

1037
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:54,367
We're wasting time.

1038
01:16:54,467 --> 01:16:55,267
LEO: Jack.

1039
01:16:58,967 --> 01:16:59,900
Yes?

1040
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,867
LEO: We've tried this before.

1041
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:03,633
It's not getting us anywhere.

1042
01:17:03,733 --> 01:17:04,900
Leo's right.

1043
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,000
We've got 12 minutes
before the pickup, Jack.

1044
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:12,333
Perhaps you have something
more persuasive in mind

1045
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:16,267
for getting Mr.
Billings to come down.

1046
01:17:16,367 --> 01:17:17,367
I do.

1047
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:18,333
[music playing]

1048
01:17:28,633 --> 01:17:30,900
Billings!

1049
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,100
This is your last chance!

1050
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:36,500
I want the boy and the
briefcase down here now,

1051
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:41,000
or I'm going to put a
bullet in this old man.

1052
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:45,233
You've got three
minutes, starting now.

1053
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:49,267
Do you hear me, Billings?

1054
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:50,233
[gunshot]

1055
01:17:53,067 --> 01:17:55,967
Give me the gun.

1056
01:17:56,067 --> 01:17:57,867
Give me it.

1057
01:17:57,967 --> 01:18:00,333
Leo!

1058
01:18:00,433 --> 01:18:01,667
O'Neil?

1059
01:18:01,767 --> 01:18:03,167
Don't shoot, we're coming in.

1060
01:18:06,233 --> 01:18:07,667
You owe me one, Leo.

1061
01:18:07,767 --> 01:18:10,700
I stopped him from putting a
bullet in your head just now.

What are you doing?
- That was for last night.

1064
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,667
That'll be enough, Mr. Logan.

1065
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:19,267
I found Edwards, too.

1066
01:18:19,367 --> 01:18:22,233
He was hanging upside down in
a tree with a bullet in him.

1067
01:18:22,333 --> 01:18:25,900

- You've been busy.

1068
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,433
Your tracker's dead, too.

1070
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:32,500

I'll take those, thank you.

1072
01:18:42,633 --> 01:18:45,000
We got what we came for,
let's get rid of these two,

1073
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:46,600
and get the hell out of here.

1074
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:48,233
Where's the boy?

1075
01:18:48,333 --> 01:18:51,233
He's dead, one of
your men shot him.

1076
01:18:51,333 --> 01:18:53,767
Why don't you show
me where the body is?

1077
01:18:53,867 --> 01:18:55,000
Suit yourself.

1078
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:56,533
Forget it, Jack.

1079
01:18:56,633 --> 01:18:59,167
If we're not at that pickup
site when the pilot gets there,

1080
01:18:59,267 --> 01:19:01,833
he's going to leave without us.

1081
01:19:01,933 --> 01:19:03,533
I suppose you're right, Leo.

1082
01:19:03,633 --> 01:19:05,933
Why don't you and your men
leave for the plane now.

1083
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:08,167
I'll be there shortly.

1084
01:19:08,267 --> 01:19:12,500
Whatever you say Jack,
just don't be late.

1085
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:13,500
[music playing]

1086
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:19,200
This way, please.

1087
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,700
There it is.

1088
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,367
I can't wait to get the
hell outta these mountains.

1089
01:19:29,467 --> 01:19:32,267
No shit.

1090
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:34,567
That'll be far
enough, thank you.

1091
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,600
Friendly little
asshole, isn't he?

1092
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:45,433
That thing's kind of
small for eight men.

1093
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:46,367
You're right.

1094
01:19:57,433 --> 01:19:58,733
What the f--

1095
01:19:58,833 --> 01:19:59,733
[gunshots]

1096
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:25,767
Your turn.

1097
01:20:25,867 --> 01:20:28,133
Got any last words?

1098
01:20:28,233 --> 01:20:29,933
Who do you really
work for, LaRouse?

1099
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,500
That all depends.

1100
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,267
I suppose one could call me a
custom-approved representative,

1101
01:20:34,367 --> 01:20:39,300
of shall we say, a country
with opposing political views.

1102
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,300
At the moment, these disks
are worth a great deal.

1103
01:20:45,767 --> 01:20:47,767
On your knees, Mr. Billings.

1104
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:50,400
No.

1105
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:55,833
Very well, good
bye, Mr. Billings.

1106
01:20:55,933 --> 01:20:57,000
[gunshots]

1107
01:21:01,833 --> 01:21:03,700
Drop it, mister.

1108
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,700
[gunshot]

1109
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:19,167
Freddie!

1110
01:21:19,267 --> 01:21:21,467
It's all over, you're
going to be all right.

1111
01:21:21,567 --> 01:21:22,433
Where's Monica?

1112
01:21:24,667 --> 01:21:25,467
Monica.

1113
01:22:02,133 --> 01:22:04,200
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Quill,
the FBI is here to see you.

1114
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:10,567
I'll be out in a moment.

1115
01:22:14,033 --> 01:22:15,533
[music playing]

1116
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:35,000
[gunshot]

1117
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:42,400
[music playing]

1118
01:23:53,067 --> 01:23:55,933
To get away from
all the bullshit.

1119
01:23:56,033 --> 01:23:57,667
I thought I saw
somebody come in here.

1120
01:23:57,767 --> 01:23:59,233
Monica.

1121
01:23:59,333 --> 01:24:00,700
I've been wondering
when you'd show up.

1122
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:03,233
It's been a while.

1123
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,500
I know.

1124
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,767
After the hearing, my mother
sent me to Europe to live

1125
01:24:06,867 --> 01:24:08,700
with my sister for a while.

1126
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,267
Where are they?

1127
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:21,367
They went away, higher
into the mountains.

1128
01:24:21,467 --> 01:24:25,333
I feel like it's all my fault.

1129
01:24:25,433 --> 01:24:27,533
Some things happen
for a reason, Greg.

1130
01:24:27,633 --> 01:24:28,567
You can't change that.

1131
01:24:31,333 --> 01:24:34,833
You think you'll
ever see them again?

1132
01:24:34,933 --> 01:24:36,767
Yeah.

1133
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:39,633
How do you know?

1134
01:24:39,733 --> 01:24:41,833
They always seem to
know when I'm here.

1135
01:24:41,933 --> 01:24:43,267
I never could
figure that one out.

1136
01:24:46,067 --> 01:24:49,100
Come on, let's go for a walk.
