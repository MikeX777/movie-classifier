1
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:47,513
March 24, 2008.

2
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:50,616
A little boy was born.

3
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:55,788
Sincere Israel Najir Grant.

4
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,692
My son.

5
00:01:13,474 --> 00:01:15,207
That's my son.

6
00:01:16,777 --> 00:01:18,343
You know where I was?

7
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,480
Nah, not the hospital bed.

8
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,683
Nah, not in the waiting room.

9
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,487
I was locked the fuck up.

10
00:01:36,764 --> 00:01:38,297
Remember getting that call.

11
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,732
Putting the call in,
I should say.

12
00:01:45,873 --> 00:01:47,706
Had a beautiful baby boy,

13
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:51,076
and I wasn't there to greet him when
he came into the world, and, um...

14
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,711
It's funny.

15
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,581
I was released the week after.

16
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,652
April 1. My pop's birthday.

17
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:03,489
Came home on April Fool's Day.
Dig that.

18
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:12,498
I remember walking in,
opening the P's.

19
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,502
Everybody...
"Yo, Primo, Primo. Oh, shit."

20
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:19,671
Fuck y'all.
I want to go see my son.

21
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,878
Walked up the stairs.
I was nervous.

22
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,548
Haven't seen my daughter
in so long.

23
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,087
Open the door.
Everybody greeting me.

24
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,890
"Oh, welcome home.
Welcome home."

25
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:42,761
"Yeah, it's nice. That-That was sweet.
Move. I want to see my son."

26
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:44,630
And I walked into the room.

27
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:48,767
There's a little baby,
about this big.

28
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:54,673
Just laying on the bed. Wrapped
up, blankets, sky blue hat on.

29
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,445
And, um... "That's my son."

30
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,419
All I kept saying was,
"That's my son."

31
00:03:10,124 --> 00:03:12,925
I remember my daughter
ran in the room and...

32
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,728
"Daddy, Sincere."

33
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,232
"Sincere, Daddy."

34
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,801
I said, "Yes, baby."

35
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,671
I picked my son up.

36
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,147
I've never...

37
00:03:35,149 --> 00:03:37,916
I can't recall
tearing so hard in my life,

38
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,818
even when my daughter was born.

39
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:44,223
But I teared like a baby...

40
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,992
because I missed the most
important part of my son's life,

41
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:48,727
and that was his coming.

42
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:55,334
And on that day, I promised
my kid... I swore to him.

43
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,769
I swore to my son
and I swore to my daughter.

44
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,841
"I'll never leave you again."

45
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:25,009
What's good, boy? Yo.
What's good, bro?

46
00:04:27,468 --> 00:04:30,702
What up, yo?
Yeah. What's good, man?

47
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,438
Yo, what's up?

48
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,611
What's good, little man?

49
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,933
You got a nicer ball.
You got a nicer ball.

50
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,592
Holy shit. Well, well, well.

51
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:56,361
What's good, man? What's up, man?
No pounds?

52
00:04:56,363 --> 00:04:57,663
I gotta go, man.

53
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,698
Hold on, bro.
Why you moving so fast, man?

54
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,266
I gotta go, man. I gotta go.

55
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,603
Just chill out, bro. What's good with you?
Take it easy, man.

56
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:06,738
What's good, man?
Why you so nervous, man?

57
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,206
Yo. Relax, bro.

58
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,643
Just a few words, man. When you
gonna start moving it for me, man?

59
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,912
I don't want to do nothing
for you, man.

60
00:05:13,914 --> 00:05:15,681
I'm good. I'm good, man.

61
00:05:15,683 --> 00:05:17,683
Watch your tone, bitch.
This nigga's a big shot.

62
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,318
What you mean you good, man?
Shit, man.

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,553
This nigga's a big shot now.
What's up, man?

64
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:24,323
Filling up your pockets?
You good? You eating?

65
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,825
Yo, John!

66
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,594
If it ain't the moneymaking RayLo.
Big Primo.

67
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:31,496
RayLo. What's good, boy?
Ain't nothing, man. Macking.

68
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,031
What you doing
with my young 'un?

69
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,866
Just saw him passing
through, chop it up with him.

70
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:36,435
You good? I'm chilling.

71
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,271
Just about to spin off, man.
It's hot as a bitch out here.

72
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:41,673
RayLo, make sure the numbers right.
I'm-a holla at you.

73
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,974
A'ight.

74
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:45,477
Where you been, man? I ain't
seen you since the funeral.

75
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,347
Chilling, bro. You gotta
come out more often, man.

76
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:50,882
Staying in the house. Shit ain't
as depressing as it looks.

77
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:54,686
Yeah, I'm stuck in the crib, man.
Well, come back out.

78
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:57,289
There's a lot more
on the streets.

79
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:58,924
I'm sorry about
your old man, though.

80
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,559
Yo, I appreciate that, man.
No problem, man.

81
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,627
Yeah, man.
Sorry about your old man.

82
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,797
Y'all knew my pops? Yeah, yo.
He was a good dude.

83
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,034
Mel was the best, you know what I mean?
Everybody knew your pops.

84
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,769
Respect. Remember that.

85
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,171
But I got you here now, so...

86
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,675
Got some kicks on. Let's see
how your ball game looking.

87
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:19,678
Bet it's better than yours.
Mmm.

88
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,321
- Check.
- You know it.

89
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,852
- Don't lose your breath.
- 1-zip.

90
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:30,636
Check up, bitch.

91
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,858
Why you fouling for?
Don't start crying.

92
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,526
Why you fouling for?
Stop crying.

93
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,561
Why you fouling? Stop crying.

94
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,031
- My point.
- Your push.

95
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,674
My point. Now you playing
like a little man.

96
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,104
You're just a hacker, yo.

97
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,439
Come on, man. Let's play ball.

98
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:49,282
Put your fucking hands up.
Let's play ball.

99
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:51,109
It's my ball. Catch up.

100
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,047
Game over! Let's go!

101
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,616
'Bout time.

102
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:01,420
How's your moms, man?
She's good.

103
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,255
How's she hanging in there?

104
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:04,790
She's living. You know.

105
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,360
We gonna make sure
she lives great.

106
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:11,863
You gonna make sure of that. You
gonna make sure and be the man.

107
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,945
Of course, man.
The man of the house.

108
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,768
All this nonsense out here
in the streets, J.

109
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,037
It ain't for you.

110
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,108
Real money.

111
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,210
What you got in mind?

112
00:07:25,212 --> 00:07:28,480
Got a lot of things in mind, but
I know what I want you to do.

113
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:32,851
I mean, like...
I owe it to your pops, man.

114
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:35,054
Yo, come on, man. Don't play
me like no little kid, man.

115
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:38,990
Relax. Nobody playing you
like a kid, John.

116
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,327
Your pops took me in
at the same age you is,

117
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,995
showed me everything
I need to know.

118
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:46,998
Understand?
Respected by everybody.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,803
Bloods, Crips,
Kings, Ñetas, everybody.

120
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,772
And he was a neutral dude.

121
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:55,607
You know why?
'Cause he gave respect.

122
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,809
He had power,
but he never abused it.

123
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,578
Understand? Yeah.

124
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,112
He took me in, five hard.

125
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:04,382
Didn't discriminate
against me or nothing.

126
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,218
Taught me
everything I need to know.

127
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:10,489
I mean, this works out for you
and you comfy,

128
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,691
which I'm sure you will be,

129
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:14,826
bring it to the home team,
know what I mean?

130
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,929
Get the one-eyed willy and do
one of these a little bit.

131
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,572
All right? You offering
me to be Blood, man?

132
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,134
It's a offer, but...

133
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,971
Don't think you gotta do what the
rest of these dudes gotta do.

134
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,807
Me, I take care of that.

135
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,209
You ain't gotta go
buck 50 no grills.

136
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:32,911
Steal no cars or some shit.

137
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:35,413
Know what I mean?
I'll bless you in.

138
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,616
I'm a five star.
They don't question me.

139
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:41,219
Say the word right now,
I'll put it in the books.

140
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,656
When you walk outside tomorrow
morning, or even in the next hour,

141
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,258
all the fuckers
is gonna salute you.

142
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,826
What's a five star?

143
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,030
Never thought I had to explain
it to you, know what I mean?

144
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,999
Always thought Mel
would be here to tell you.

145
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,905
Five lanes, baby.

146
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:04,075
First five to ever start
this whole Blood Piru game.

147
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,210
I mean...

148
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,614
It goes deeper than what
you see on the TV.

149
00:09:10,384 --> 00:09:13,485
Right now, what you read...

150
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,287
got Bloods and Crips
fighting over this.

151
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,723
Five stars, we don't
gotta fight over that.

152
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:20,725
Understand? We generals.
We salute everything.

153
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,294
We done bossed up.

154
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,196
Everybody answers to me.

155
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,866
Shit don't go down
unless it goes through me.

156
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,901
Before it was me,
it was me and your pops.

157
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:35,006
I love him to death, but what
he taught me, I'm gonna use.

158
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:38,910
I'm-a do for you
what was done for me.

159
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,272
Put you under the wing. You ain't
gotta worry about nothing.

160
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,815
Know what I mean?

161
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,350
You ready to come home?

162
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,047
You really think
that was a stray bullet?

163
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:12,944
Uh...

164
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,748
I mean,
you gotta remember, son.

165
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,516
The streets are talking.
The streets are evil.

166
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,552
You feel me? Like...

167
00:10:20,554 --> 00:10:22,487
People are negative.

168
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:25,924
People were envious of the respect
he had, 'cause he had it.

169
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,425
You feel me? Like,
niggas would be, like...

170
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,327
"Yo, why he got all that for?"

171
00:10:29,329 --> 00:10:30,862
"What about me? What I got?"

172
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:34,566
Hold on one sec.

173
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:36,101
Hello?

174
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:38,770
What's good?

175
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,406
What?

176
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,243
You can't handle that?

177
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:50,135
So you want me to come
all the way over there?

178
00:10:51,952 --> 00:10:53,992
All right. I'll be there
in 15 minutes, man.

179
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:57,389
Fifteen minutes, man.

180
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:02,460
Look, man,
I make a rule real quick.

181
00:11:02,462 --> 00:11:04,796
Swing by the crib,
we'll chop it up.

182
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,198
I mean talk a little more.
All right.

183
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,635
Look like you're
having a party right now.

184
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:45,704
We just sitting, chilling, man.

185
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,740
You got a problem.
What's the problem?

186
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:51,176
I'm here. I know you're here.

187
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:54,145
- Damn.
- Want my money. That's what's up, like...

188
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,648
Like I said, give me two
days, and you'll have your money.

189
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,383
Two more days.

190
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,386
You sent your little army, squad down
here, whatever you wanna call 'em.

191
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,222
Know what I'm saying? I sent 'em back
empty-handed, as you can see. Look at it.

192
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,257
It's a little rough
down here, man.

193
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,027
I mean, it's hard right now, man.
That's not my problem!

194
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,929
Getting the package to you,
that's my problem.

195
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:12,731
I get two days? Two extra days?

196
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,332
That's all I ask for, man.

197
00:12:14,334 --> 00:12:16,801
Been running with you for two years, bro.
Know what I'm saying?

198
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,903
You got it.

199
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:20,438
Two days. That was rude of me.

200
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,241
Good looking, man. Look out.
Know what I'm saying?

201
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,603
It's just business.
That's cool.

202
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,246
Just business.

203
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,948
It was just business.

204
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:32,751
It's just fucking business.
It's just business, right?

205
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,819
Here. Let me do that for you.

206
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,722
But you... You know that you...

207
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,405
Just being in the kitchen alone
is a privilege right now.

208
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:20,165
If you showed me how to do what you
do, we could be doing it together.

209
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,600
Ew. That's why your corn
be tasting so sweet.

210
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,170
What? Mind your business and
stay out of my damn kitchen.

211
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,413
Maybe I need to stand in the
kitchen with you more often.

212
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,209
You hear my secrets.

213
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,844
If I find out
anybody's cooking like me,

214
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,612
I'll know where
they got it from.

215
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,614
From you.

216
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,016
I'm not telling nobody
about that.

217
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:39,884
I don't put sugar in corn.

218
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,964
Time to eat, guys. Huh?

219
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,567
Come on. Let's go.

220
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,368
Come on, E'niyah. Eli?

221
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,872
Eli?

222
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:03,308
It's time to eat.
Come eat. Come eat.

223
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,578
I'm hungry.

224
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,431
I found it. Go
put it in the garbage.

225
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:32,136
Eat.

226
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:33,838
Growing up,

227
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,841
I used to always want
to be a prima ballerina.

228
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:41,512
I see myself being
somebody important...

229
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:45,149
and hopefully making a
difference in someone's life.

230
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:47,785
Making a
difference in whose life?

231
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,988
I don't know.

232
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,023
So what do you want to be?
You'll be, like, a teacher?

233
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:54,726
No! I mean, maybe. I don't know.
Maybe?

234
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:58,463
I don't know. I don't think
kids will like me that much.

235
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:00,031
Go on. Where do
you see yourself?

236
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,933
I don't know.

237
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,534
Sit down.

238
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,575
You ever been
to the zoo before?

239
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,112
That's so random, but, no.

240
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:16,481
It's just a question.
I haven't.

241
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:18,850
Why not?

242
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,753
I don't know. Because... Not even,
like, a school trip or nothing?

243
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:25,356
Nothing. I mean, of course
I had chances, I guess.

244
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:26,858
I just never went.

245
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,093
Why? You were scared? No.

246
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:30,895
Tell me what's up. Why not?

247
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,330
Isn't it kind of, like,
a kid thing though?

248
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:35,133
Don't little kids
go to... Hell, no.

249
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,635
You ever seen a grizzly bear?
No.

250
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:41,472
Them shits is, like, seven
feet tall, 300 pounds.

251
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:44,709
Like crazy vicious, but at the same
time they're like little kittens.

252
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:47,312
Mad playful and just...

253
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,013
They're cool. You gotta see it.

254
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:52,417
I would like that.

255
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,052
So you saying I could take you?

256
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:56,387
Are you asking me? Kind of.

257
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,257
I think we could
work something out.

258
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:37,929
Right on time. What's up, man?

259
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:39,597
What up, boy? What's good, yo?

260
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,798
Chillin', man. What up?

261
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,233
What you been up to?

262
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,535
Macking, man.

263
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:47,205
Why you got this whole
block smelling like sh...

264
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,208
You crazy, man.

265
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,077
I'm-a holla at you, boy.
Where you at?

266
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,579

267
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,381
Okay. Hubby life.

00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,162
Yo. What up?

269
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:13,197
What's good?

270
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,867
You got that? Yeah.

271
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,805
We good to go.

272
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,488
All right. I took care of it.
I got you, man.

273
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:32,517
<i>[ Hip-hop ]</i>

274
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,720
What's good, yo?

275
00:17:37,624 --> 00:17:40,265
You got the goons out here, yo.

276
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,067
Good luck, son.
I'm-a holla at ya.

277
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,151
How's the food?

278
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,587
It's good.

279
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,557
Even though I hate vegetables
or whatever this green stuff is.

280
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,227
So you saw Jasmin today?

281
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:19,764
How was that?

282
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:22,533
Yeah. Yeah?

283
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,570
What, Mom?
Did I teach you how to speak...

284
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:27,939
so you can answer my question
with one word?

285
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,261
She's nice, Ma. She's nice.

286
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,747
I'm not gonna be home
tomorrow night.

287
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,183
Where you going?

288
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,285
I-I gotta go out.

289
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,920
Out where? You got a date?

290
00:18:42,922 --> 00:18:44,555
Oh, crap.

291
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,157
And me find out.

292
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:47,992
I'm gonna go play bingo. Bingo!

293
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:49,994
In Titi's house?

294
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,864
Mm-hmm. It's Friday.

295
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:55,099
You told me to get out
of the house and do something,

296
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,667
so I'm going to play bingo
in Titi's house.

297
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,102
Tell Titi I say hi.

298
00:18:58,104 --> 00:19:00,771
She was asking about you, so why
don't you go say hi yourself.

299
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,174
I don't wanna go over there.
She annoys me.

300
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:08,813
And she got those couches with the
freaking... with the plastic on it.

301
00:19:08,815 --> 00:19:10,414
It be sticking to my skin.

302
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,376
I hate... I hate her house.

303
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,087
Are you giving me
that look, like...

304
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,655
You know exactly
what I'm talking about.

305
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:20,858
You know she put that plastic there
so you can protect the furniture.

306
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,460
Yeah.

307
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,896
She protecting the furniture
for the past, like, 40 years.

308
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,898
But she got it for 40 years
'cause she put that plastic...

309
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,634
She gonna protect it
for another 40 years, right?

310
00:19:29,636 --> 00:19:31,269
Tell her to take that shit off.

311
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,271
Now you're getting too, like,

312
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,006
plastic in the furniture
and shit.

313
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,641
Come on, Ma.

314
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,246
So...

315
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,850
Do you know, um, about...

316
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,253
About what? Safe sex?

317
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,755
Come on, Ma.

318
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:53,157
Don't start talking
about this stuff.

319
00:19:53,793 --> 00:19:56,194
So who is supposed to
talk to you about this stuff?

320
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,596
I know about this stuff.
What do you know about?

321
00:19:58,598 --> 00:20:00,431
I took sex ed.

322
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,900
Okay. What did it teach you?

323
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:05,536
First of all, I learned
how to put a condom on.

324
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,740
You know?

325
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,876
Back in my days, you didn't
have to wear condoms, because...

326
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:14,812
Oh, come on, Ma.
You'd be with just one person.

327
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,615
And you don't be running around
with Tom, Dick and Harry.

328
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:21,352
You just stay with one man, and you didn't
have to worry about condoms or no condoms.

329
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,794
There's nothing wrong
with more than one girl.

330
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,390
What?

331
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,294
I did not raise you
to be a player.

332
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,797
I raised you better than that.

333
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,166
Come on, Ma.
I told you about respecting...

334
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:36,968
I told you about
respecting a woman.

335
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,669
I do respect women.

336
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:45,343
If Jasmin comes here crying,
you're gonna get it.

337
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:47,912
Ma, she's not gonna come here crying.
If Jasmin comes over here...

338
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:51,749
complaining about you and telling
me that you broke her heart,

339
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,918
you're gonna deal with me, boy.

340
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,053
I love you, Mother.
Yeah, I love you too.

341
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,236
The A/C is on.

342
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,871
So why's it not working?

343
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,007
Call the landlord.

344
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,211
So, what, he can come get punched
in the face?

345
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:21,746
Why you gonna
punch him in his face?

346
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:24,415
Because he's fucking annoying
with all this bullshit.

347
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:27,051
Fucking yesterday
he texted me...

348
00:21:27,053 --> 00:21:30,388
"Oh, if you have a problem
with paying the rent..."

349
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,723
and you have a problem
with being there,

350
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:36,060
"I'll refund you
your security deposit."

351
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,929
Complaining... You ain't fixed the
fucking closet doors for six months.

352
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:41,465
How long we waited
for the closet doors,

353
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:43,734
the bathroom,
the sink was fucked up?

354
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:45,870
Six months.

355
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:48,606
Now you complaining
'cause of one month?

356
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:51,042
And you gonna tell me
I can get my deposit back?

357
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:54,712
Come bring my deposit
so I can kick your ass...

358
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,380
all up and down
the fucking block,

359
00:21:56,382 --> 00:21:57,848
then ship him back
to fucking Nigeria.

360
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,550
You can't put hands on him.
Why not?

361
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:02,053
You put your hands on him
and risk him calling the police.

362
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,356
That's why you
do the job to the T.

363
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,991
You mean kill him? Huh?

364
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,827
You gonna kill him?
No. Don't have to kill him.

365
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,029
Just bust his head to a coma.

366
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,791
Put him in a permanent sleep.

367
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:18,069
That is funny, though,
because... Don't say that.

368
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:19,670
Don't say it.

369
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:21,872
Give me it!

370
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:24,342
Give it to him
and leave him alone.

371
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,144
What is he crying for? 'Cause he
went in there with the little stick.

372
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,713
Give it to him.

373
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:31,682
And y'all be nice.

374
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:33,351
I ain't got it.
E'niyah, give it back.

375
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:35,820
Give it to him. And be nice.

376
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,459
Don't start, 'cause I'll shut
down the whole park operation,

377
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,627
and everybody can
stay home and have naps.

378
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:46,731
No, I... I put
to Elijah, because...

379
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,134
It's supposed to be
duck, duck, duck, goose!

380
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:54,672
Well, we gotta figure something
out, 'cause I'm pregnant.

381
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:55,940
What?

382
00:23:09,689 --> 00:23:13,090
I mean, we havin' a baby.

383
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,960
Another one. Yeah.

384
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,463
That means bigger place,
more room.

385
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,633
We're a team. We'll do it.

386
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,003
A kiss?

387
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:32,209
This what I'm gonna have to deal with
in seven months? We can't reach?

388
00:23:32,211 --> 00:23:34,412
It's gonna be worse. Mm-hmm.

389
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,749
I love you.

390
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:03,400
What's good?

391
00:25:03,402 --> 00:25:05,282
'Sup, man? Chilling.

392
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,807
Talk to me. What's up?

393
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,543
I'm ready to make some money.
Okay.

394
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,280
This ain't no easy game, though.
You know that, right?

395
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,249
Yeah, I know.

396
00:25:18,251 --> 00:25:20,117
How much do you know?

397
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,089
I'm not, like, an expert on
everything, but I can learn.

398
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:33,697
But if someone wants to run a
kilo, how much would they make?

399
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,267
Off a kilo alone,
running that...

400
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:42,172
He'll see more than
three, five stacks.

401
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:46,010
After you drop off,
package is complete...

402
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,114
Two minutes, you make one call.

403
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:53,717
"Cookies are finished."

404
00:25:54,487 --> 00:25:56,453
Everything is in code.

405
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,557
You never say,
"The package is delivered."

406
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,840
'Cause then you just
signed yourself over.

407
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:06,931
And if you in this,
you in this.

408
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,168
Ain't no room for error.
There's no room for slipup.

409
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:15,205
First little small mistake...

410
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,009
will get you a large sentence.

411
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:25,049
Once that's done... You make
everything seem so freaking...

412
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,819
Everything sounds like
a death threat, bro.

413
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:32,656
Well, what path
you think we on?

414
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,094
I'm trying to... I'm trying to
earn some extra cash, man.

415
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:39,964
Bro, if you want to earn extra
cash, get a job at Mickey D's.

416
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,366
Come on, man. You know what kind
of extra cash I'm talking about.

417
00:26:42,368 --> 00:26:44,568
All right. Well, this is
what I'm talking about.

418
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,090
We talking about
the same thing.

419
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,808
You said you want to man up. Ain't
no room for boys over here.

420
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,676
I'm listening. All right.
So then listen.

421
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,244
And like I said...

422
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,949
You go for your pickup.
You got cash on you.

423
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,655
After you grip your package,
one route.

424
00:27:04,657 --> 00:27:06,790
There's no stops,
there's no in-betweens.

425
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:09,727
Ain't no go see your girl
or go see your mans.

426
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:13,230
One route to the drop-off.

427
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:14,531
A'ight.

428
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,400
Nah. It ain't "a'ight."

429
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,968
It's one route.

430
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm not saying I'm, like...

431
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,810
Come with me.

432
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:31,248
That's my son Sincere.

433
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,684
Come. Come. Quick.

434
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:36,020
Come here. Putt-Putt.
Come here.

435
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:38,822
They're not...
They're not sharing.

436
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,624
They're not sharing? Yes.

437
00:27:40,626 --> 00:27:42,359
Okay. What is that, a boo-boo?

438
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,161
Let me see.

439
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:47,031
Okay, listen. I
need you to do me a favor.

440
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,732
Uh-uh. Look at me. Look at me.

441
00:27:48,734 --> 00:27:50,467
I need you to do me a favor.

442
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,836
Daddy's doing business
right now.

443
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,305
Can you stay outside for a
little bit for me, please?

444
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:56,740
Yes. And I'll come get you?

445
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,642
Yes. It's a deal?

446
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:01,145
Yes. Can I have a hug?

447
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:03,747
Don't gimme that cheap stuff.
Give me the real stuff.

448
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,816
Go ahead, fat butt.

449
00:28:05,818 --> 00:28:08,138
And I'll be outside
in a minute, all right?

450
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,120
Okay? Yeah.

451
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,574
I ain't trying to be
in this forever, man.

452
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:21,165
I got my family
to really provide for.

453
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,201
They depend on me.

454
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,405
But bottom line, everything
I do is for my family.

455
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:32,776
And there are certain changes in
place right now for my family.

456
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,658
Take it down to brown tacks,
it's like...

457
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,415
I don't touch a package.

458
00:28:39,652 --> 00:28:41,251
I got kids.

459
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,754
Four of 'em.

460
00:28:46,659 --> 00:28:51,528
It ain't for me,
you know? Like...

461
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,898
Especially when I think about
Sincere, you know, like...

462
00:28:56,469 --> 00:29:00,170
The doctors diagnosed him
as being "autistic."

463
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,842
I think my son is perfect.

464
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,446
He's just different from
all other kids out there.

465
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:16,386
Because he chooses not to maintain
eye contact with a stranger...

466
00:29:18,858 --> 00:29:20,578
My son is perfect.

467
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:24,294
Come on, Zoe. Get down.

468
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,396
Come on.

469
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,072
So I'm gonna let you try,
but don't fuck up.

470
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,444
Do a run and see what happens.

471
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:46,150
I got this, man.

472
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,330
Ain't no sympathy in this shit.

473
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,538
It's real.

474
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,271
She looks like the quiet one.

475
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:43,073
Tequila maybe.

476
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,708
Enjoy yourself, baby.

477
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:52,516
Take it. Have a sample.

478
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,718
You always got some new shit.

479
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,253
That's called Barack Obama.

480
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,223
And this is Michelle Obama.

481
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:01,925
Together, I call it
Health Care.

482
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,828
All right. See me
at the end of the night.

483
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:06,430
Swing back.
You keep the sample.

484
00:31:06,432 --> 00:31:08,098
Yeah?

485
00:31:09,201 --> 00:31:11,301
What's up, guys? ID's?

486
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,176
Both of you? Yeah. That's me.

487
00:31:19,178 --> 00:31:21,144
Lucky bitch.

488
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:24,314
Thanks, man.

489
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,050
<i>He wanted to know if you could
do security tonight at his club.</i>

490
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,586
<i>For Tony Yayo,</i>
<i>the guy from G-Unit.</i>

491
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:32,022
Bodyguard work or just...
Yeah. It's bodyguard work.

492
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,523
It's one night.
What do you think?

493
00:31:34,894 --> 00:31:36,393
I'll do it. How many guys?

494
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:38,228
You'd need, like,
three or four guys.

495
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:40,397
I got some people.

496
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,111
See that Henny? I need a drink.

497
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:56,213
See the liquor all out?

498
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:59,255
Nah, I wanna pour my own drink.

499
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,451
It's my brother.

500
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:04,333
He shoulda came too. We
played all right. Let me speak to him.

501
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:07,905
Hold it up. Hold it, hold it.

502
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,050
Wish he was
right here, right now.

503
00:32:14,076 --> 00:32:15,499
Say, "Man, you missed the show."

504
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:17,834
Been locked up for 12 years.
Don't worry. He be good.

505
00:32:17,836 --> 00:32:20,396
Nah, 12 years is a long time.
But he learning, though.

506
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,874
Oh, shit, yo.

507
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:25,809
Don't smoke. Oh.

508
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:27,678
Where I know you from?

509
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,112
From the hood. What's good?

510
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,915
Oh, shit, yo. What up?

511
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,150
- What's up?
- What's good?

512
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,751
What's goin' on, nigga?
How 'bout you?

513
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:36,320
Everything good, man. Cool.

514
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:38,422
- Take a seat. Sit down, man.
- Good show, man. Good shit.

515
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,090
I'll sit down for a little bit.

516
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:41,892
Have, you know, 50
while we working.

517
00:32:41,894 --> 00:32:43,593
What's up with you, man?

518
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,063
Working, man. Trying to stay out
the hood, stay out the bullshit.

519
00:32:46,065 --> 00:32:47,664
I got something. Yo, White.

520
00:32:47,666 --> 00:32:50,233
I got my nigga from Edgemere right here.
That's the homeys way.

521
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:51,868
What's shaking, dog?
What's shaking, homey?

522
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,904
You know him?

523
00:32:53,906 --> 00:32:56,306
Big homey supreme.

00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,944
Why wouldn't it be?

526
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,479
I got the
homeys with me too, man.

527
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:04,982
You ain't gotta tell me that.
I know how you move.

528
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:06,950
What's good, though?

529
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,186
I'm staying out of trouble.
How 'bout you?

530
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:11,254
Same shit. Just doing
this legal hustle, man.

531
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,557
Bodyguarding niggas like you.

532
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:15,760
So you staying out the street?
You ain't on the streets.

533
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:18,028
I've seen you throwing
it up over there, homey.

534
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,263
I mean... That's Blood to the heart, man.
That shit don't change, but...

535
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,898
Kids. You got kids, Primo?

536
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,400
Yeah, plans two of two.

537
00:33:23,402 --> 00:33:25,102
You gotta live
for them kids, man.

538
00:33:25,104 --> 00:33:26,503
After a while, a nigga
get a little older.

539
00:33:26,505 --> 00:33:28,538
Gotta switch up
his hustle, man.

540
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,441
Get kids, you gotta grow up.
You gotta leave certain things alone.

541
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:32,943
Yeah, man. I had
to retire my ratchet.

542
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:35,278
You gotta know when to switch it up.
Know what I'm saying?

543
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,315
Like, the hood got love for
you, and I love the hood,

544
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:41,084
but you gotta know
when to, you know...

545
00:33:41,086 --> 00:33:43,153
I'm in and out.
You know what I'm saying?

546
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,355
I stop by, show niggas love.
Appreciate that.

547
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,890
Try not to be caught up
in the bullshit,

548
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,559
'cause you know niggas die over
petty shit in the streets, homey.

549
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:51,194
You Blood.
You from Brooklyn, homey.

550
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,863
I already know
what it is, nigga.

551
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,831
Niggas ain't smiling
where you from.

552
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:57,100
Niggas definitely ain't
smiling where I'm from.

553
00:33:57,102 --> 00:33:59,503
You can't wake up
smiling and be happy.

554
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:03,807
Nah. You gotta walk around with
a certain kind of persona on.

555
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:05,409
You know what I'm saying.

556
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:16,766
Daddy. What's
your favorite color?

557
00:37:16,768 --> 00:37:18,768
Red.

558
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,504
Your favorite color? Red?
Mm-hmm.

559
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,174
What's your favorite color?
My favorite color's blue.

560
00:37:24,176 --> 00:37:26,876
Let me see you do your best fish.
What you gonna draw, E'niyah?

561
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:29,212
- I like to draw a balloon.
- You want to draw me balloons, E'niyah?

562
00:37:29,214 --> 00:37:30,914
Yes. Draw me balloons.

563
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,449
Like this. Yeah.

564
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:36,219
A circle. Like that.

565
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:38,688
Okay. Okay.

566
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,657
What's wrong, Putt-Putt?

567
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,292
He didn't want
to change his pants.

568
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:43,827
Okay. Come here. Come here.

569
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,562
You don't want to... Come here.
Come sit.

570
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,330
Okay, okay, okay. Come.

571
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:50,000
Can you stop?

572
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:52,969
Can you stop, please?

573
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:58,074
- All right. Enough.
- Write Mommy's name.

574
00:37:58,076 --> 00:38:01,378
- How do you spell your name?
- Sound it out.

575
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,216
Um... Two name. Um, three.

576
00:38:06,218 --> 00:38:10,754
What three names? I
have to sound out three letters.

577
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,627
Who wants breakfast? Me!

578
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,962
Me!

579
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:21,165
Jesus.

580
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,367
You can make
your own breakfast.

581
00:38:26,338 --> 00:38:28,305
What do y'all want? Cereal?

582
00:38:28,307 --> 00:38:30,073
Yes!

583
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,478
Let me see what this says.

584
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:41,451
"Mom, you love me because
you like 'mens'?" What?

585
00:38:41,453 --> 00:38:45,221
What?

586
00:38:45,223 --> 00:38:47,123
And this one says,

587
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:52,529
"Happy birthday, Dad. For
Dad, who I love. Boy."

588
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:54,130
Ew! That's him.

589
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:56,533
Thanks very much. She called
me a boy, right, E'niyah?

590
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:59,102
Ow. Shoot.

591
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:02,339
That looks like a... I did
not make nothing on this.

592
00:39:02,341 --> 00:39:04,708
You didn't make nothing? You just
folded up the pink paper for me?

593
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,443
I'll go make another one.

594
00:39:06,445 --> 00:39:09,746
Can you try and make me
a triangle, please?

595
00:39:09,748 --> 00:39:11,448
I don't know how!

596
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,650
I gotta hang all the
pictures on the wall.

597
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:16,019
You gotta make me a triangle
so I can put it on the wall.

598
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:20,457
I don't know how.
Go ask Mommy to help you.

599
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,058
Or do you want me to help you?

600
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,660
I want you to help me.

601
00:39:23,662 --> 00:39:27,142
So go get a crayon, and we're
gonna do it right here.

602
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:47,457
That guy came knocking
on my door. He said...

603
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,553
Hi, baby. How you doing?

604
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,323
Look at him.

605
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:55,325
Spend some time with your<i> titi.
</i> She came to see you.

606
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:57,727
Hi, Titi.

607
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,829
My God. You got
so handsome and big.

608
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,931
Where you going? I gotta, um...

609
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,868
You know where he's going? He's
coming with us for a<i> café con leche.</i>

610
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,036
We're gonna have some<i> café.
</i> You know I hate coffee, Ma.

611
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:09,572
Come on. You have to come with me.
Your aunt came to see you.

612
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,307
Let's go and spend a
little time with her,

613
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,876
have a<i> café con leche con pan.</i>

614
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:14,577
You look like you lost weight.
I'm, like...

615
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,546
Now he's making Titi feel good.

616
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:18,081
Your<i> titi</i> came to see you.

617
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:20,383
And you don't give me
a kiss or a hug either, macho?

618
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,520
Come on, Ma. Ant's waiting.

619
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,128
Oh, my God. I don't know.

620
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,431
They get big too fast.

621
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:37,033
I didn't realize I was so heavy.
He told me I lost some weight.

622
00:40:39,171 --> 00:40:41,337
<i>Want you to make a
run, pick up a little package.</i>

623
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:43,006
Holla back at me later on.
All right?

624
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:46,509
Take a walk. Talk it out.

625
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,681
We out of here.

626
00:41:50,976 --> 00:41:52,976
Is he bothering you?

627
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:55,812
Just a bit. Just a little bit?

628
00:41:55,814 --> 00:42:00,717
We're drinking
our drinks right now.

629
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:03,000
How do we stay in touch?

630
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,760
Yo, what's good, man?

631
00:42:10,762 --> 00:42:13,563
What the fuck you doing out here?
What you doing?

632
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,265
Nothing. Just chilling.
Enjoying the night.

633
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,766
Who this? Who this?

634
00:42:16,768 --> 00:42:19,235
Hi. Jasmin.
This my girl, Jasmin.

635
00:42:19,237 --> 00:42:21,337
This your girl? Yeah, man.

636
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:23,406
You got a good one. Come here.

637
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:24,874
You all right? Yeah, I'm okay.

638
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,176
Tell her relax.
She around family.

639
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:30,179
She a little too nice for you.
Turn around for me, sweetie.

640
00:42:30,181 --> 00:42:33,283
Taking care of John?
Of course. All the time.

641
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:34,851
Don't work him out too much.

642
00:42:34,853 --> 00:42:37,153
I need him to, you know, be
energized in the morning.

643
00:42:37,155 --> 00:42:38,588
Bye, brother. Why?

644
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,156
Huh? Why?

645
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:42,825
None of your business
right now.

646
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:44,460
We'll see how long
you stick around.

647
00:42:44,462 --> 00:42:46,062
Come on, man.
Watch your mouth, yo.

648
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,630
For her? Yeah, man.

649
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,566
Fuck outta here. Go ahead.
Take her home, Johnny.

650
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,301
You some disrespectful-ass
nigga, man.

651
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:53,269
What happened? John.

652
00:42:53,271 --> 00:42:55,572
What, man? Don't get too
big for your britches.

653
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:57,574
You're disrespectful, man.

654
00:43:00,278 --> 00:43:02,079
Where does
your mom think you're at?

655
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,914
She thinks I'm here, just alone.

656
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,817
She probably knows that
someone's over here.

657
00:43:07,819 --> 00:43:09,752
I don't want her to know that.

658
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,121
She started talking to me
about condoms earlier.

659
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:15,224
So what else did she say? Did
she mention anything about me?

660
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,795
Of course. She always mentions you.

661
00:43:18,797 --> 00:43:21,598
What did she say? She said,
"When is the wedding day?"

662
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,567
Oh, my God. Shut up.
You know my mom.

663
00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:28,037
And what did
you tell her? Did you tell her a date?

664
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:31,507
Look at you. Look at
you, moving hella fast.

665
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,200
I told her that I like you.

666
00:43:40,185 --> 00:43:43,426
I told her you were cute too.

667
00:44:04,209 --> 00:44:05,942
My phone is, like,
going crazy over here.

668
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:08,378
Why don't you put it on silent?

669
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,680
All these people... I wonder
who's texting me right now.

670
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:12,248
It's not me.

671
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:17,587
No, but, seriously,

672
00:44:17,589 --> 00:44:19,656
don't try to fight
for something so hard.

673
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,158
You might get answers
you don't wanna know.

674
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:26,529
What if I do wanna know?

675
00:44:26,531 --> 00:44:29,732
Sometimes things
are better left unsaid.

676
00:44:52,724 --> 00:44:56,659
It was like when I was, like, seven.
We were just at the park.

677
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,229
And he would always run and I would always
chase him, but I could never catch him.

678
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,432
He was way too fast.

679
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:04,801
And he grabbed my right hand
with his right hand,

680
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:07,837
and he grabbed my left hand
with his left hand.

681
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,439
He just started running,

682
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:12,241
and I had to, like, try to keep up
with him because he had my hands.

683
00:45:12,243 --> 00:45:13,676
And I could.

684
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:17,013
For like a brief second I was
running just as fast as him.

685
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:21,284
And, like, I knew I was flying.

686
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,348
I'm up!

687
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:28,518
Are you up or are you awake?

688
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,987
I'm up, Ma. I'm up.

689
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,002
Oh, f...

690
00:46:47,672 --> 00:46:51,107
You better clean this room before
you leave the house! You hear me?

691
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:55,211
I got it, I got it, I got it, Ma.
I got it.

692
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:57,346
I mean it.

693
00:46:57,348 --> 00:46:59,748
Yes.

694
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,732
I don't wanna work
in no supermarket.

695
00:47:16,734 --> 00:47:18,534
<i>Nene,</i> you know, work is work.

696
00:47:18,536 --> 00:47:20,937
As long as it's honest
work, it's work. This...

697
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:22,471
What's wrong
with the supermarket?

698
00:47:25,376 --> 00:47:29,245
Can you just stop by
before you go to the park?

699
00:47:29,247 --> 00:47:33,082
I'll stop by and see
what they're hiring for.

700
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,650
Because Don Jose's
waiting for you.

701
00:47:34,652 --> 00:47:37,086
I already talked to him about it.
He's already waiting for you.

702
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:40,756
Look at you. He gonna come up to me and
gonna start asking me mad questions.

703
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:43,259
Well, he gonna ask you questions
to give you the job, John.

704
00:47:43,261 --> 00:47:44,927
I don't even wanna work there.

705
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,629
You just walk in
and they gonna hire you?

706
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:49,298
But you setting me up for interviews
you haven't even talked to me about.

707
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,102
Cause if I talk to you
about it, you're gonna say no.

708
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:55,204
I'm just looking out. You're
always doing that, Ma.

709
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,447
I'm just looking out. I know
you always looking out for me.

710
00:48:07,585 --> 00:48:09,652
So, what up, yo? You Primo boy?

711
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:12,154
Primo sent me. I'm not his boy, man.
My name is John.

712
00:48:12,156 --> 00:48:14,357
So whose boy you be? Melvin.

713
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:16,692
Oh, you Melvin's boy?
Yeah, man.

714
00:48:16,694 --> 00:48:18,628
Your old man was good people, man.
Definitely, definitely.

715
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,564
Well, come here, man.
Let me holla at you, man.

716
00:48:23,134 --> 00:48:27,303
Yo, anything you need,

717
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:30,106
you come holla at me,
all right?

718
00:48:30,108 --> 00:48:32,909
I got you.
Melvin was good to me.

719
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:35,478
You heard? All right, man.

720
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,980
Good looks, man. I got a little
something for you though, man.

721
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:40,983
Yes, sir.
You know I respect that.

722
00:48:40,985 --> 00:48:43,386
That's just good business.

723
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:47,156
Hold up, man.
All right, let me see it.

724
00:48:47,158 --> 00:48:49,225
All right, I like that.
I like that.

725
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:51,761
Stay where you are. Stay
where you are. My man.

726
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:55,323
All right. Yes, sir. All right.

727
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:09,038
That's just good business, man.
I like that. Yeah, man.

728
00:49:15,353 --> 00:49:18,793
All right. Three hundred
for two shifts.

729
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:23,592
Thanks, bro.

730
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,127
You should count that.

731
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:28,764
I just watched you count it.
I trust you.

732
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,800
Well, um...

733
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:34,704
Kinda need some more shifts.
You got anything going?

734
00:49:34,706 --> 00:49:37,974
Thing is, I only need
bouncers two nights a week.

735
00:49:37,976 --> 00:49:39,542
Friday and Saturday.

736
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:45,381
Well, I can kind of use
anything right now.

737
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,851
I got something.

738
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,553
My sister's ex is a nut job.

739
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:53,676
Nothing serious. But he just
gets out of hand sometimes.

740
00:49:57,095 --> 00:49:58,661
I'll take it.

741
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:07,636
Hold on. I'll call you later.
All right.

742
00:50:07,638 --> 00:50:09,572
What's up, Ma? Hi, baby.

743
00:50:09,574 --> 00:50:11,173
Eh, eh.

744
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,576
What happened?

745
00:50:13,578 --> 00:50:15,411
I was outside.

746
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:18,814
Come here.

747
00:50:18,816 --> 00:50:21,317
Come on, Ma. Come here.

748
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:26,522
What's up?

749
00:50:33,097 --> 00:50:34,797
What's up?

750
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:38,167
Stop looking at me like that, Ma.
Come on.

751
00:50:38,169 --> 00:50:41,003
You think I don't know, John?
Know what?

752
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:44,774
Did you went to talk to Don Jose
about the job in the supermarket?

753
00:50:48,246 --> 00:50:51,347
Come on, Ma, don't start with this.
Please don't.

754
00:50:55,486 --> 00:50:57,453
What were you doing
in the park?

755
00:50:57,455 --> 00:50:59,522
Nothing. I was just playing
ball with Ant. Come on.

756
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:03,025
That's what your father
used to say to me, John.

757
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:04,527
But I didn't
pay attention to him,

758
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,495
'cause we were little kids
and I was in love and...

759
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:08,697
Come on, Ma. I'm not a baby.
But you're my kid, John.

760
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:11,801
I'm not a baby, Ma. You're
not fooling anybody, John.

761
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:13,469
You're not fooling me.

762
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,110
Can you please stop asking me questions?
I'm gonna go to my room.

763
00:51:21,112 --> 00:51:22,745
No. Eh.

764
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:25,581
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

765
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,423
Come on. I really don't wanna
talk right now.

766
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:38,360
If you knew he was
doing all of this,

767
00:51:38,362 --> 00:51:40,229
why you stay with him so long?

768
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:42,832
Because I loved him, John.

769
00:51:42,834 --> 00:51:45,234
I couldn't tell you
what he was really doing...

770
00:51:45,236 --> 00:51:47,670
because I was
not there with him.

771
00:51:49,107 --> 00:51:51,540
He protected me
from things like that.

772
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:55,678
He loved you.

773
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,148
He can't even protect me now.
How does he love me?

774
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,151
And when I needed
something, he was there.

775
00:52:02,153 --> 00:52:03,752
When he would call...

776
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:06,255
You don't remember because
you were so young, but he...

777
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:07,858
Ma, but it's not all
about the money, Ma.

778
00:52:07,859 --> 00:52:10,993
It's not all about what he gives
you every first of the month.

779
00:52:10,995 --> 00:52:13,329
It's not anything
about that, Ma.

780
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:19,502
He tried to be a father, a man
of his house, but he couldn't.

781
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:22,071
All he knew was the streets, so
he went back on the streets,

782
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:23,672
and I couldn't stop him.

783
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:27,176
He just couldn't be here, John.

784
00:52:27,178 --> 00:52:28,844
He chose to be out there.

785
00:52:30,448 --> 00:52:32,748
You don't understand that.

786
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,684
When people look at you,
they remember your father.

787
00:52:37,388 --> 00:52:41,891
And sometimes people
wanted to hurt him.

788
00:52:41,893 --> 00:52:45,494
And I don't want the same
thing to happen to you...

789
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:48,631
just because you
remind people of him.

790
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:53,202
And every day,

791
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:58,340
every single time you walk out
that door and you go to that park,

792
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,309
all I can do is worry.

793
00:53:00,311 --> 00:53:02,871
Me and my father are not
the same people, Mother.

794
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:08,851
You're putting yourself in the same
position that your father did.

795
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,586
No, I'm not. We're
not the same person.

796
00:53:10,588 --> 00:53:12,922
Hanging out with who knows...

797
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:15,958
with the wrong kind of people.

798
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,560
Ma, can I just go to my room?

799
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:20,803
I really don't wanna talk
about this right now.

800
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:26,702
John.

801
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,204
What?

802
00:53:28,206 --> 00:53:30,606
Don't walk away from me.

803
00:53:30,608 --> 00:53:33,676
I'm here. I'm talking to you, but
you're not telling me anything.

804
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:35,811
What is it that you
want me to tell you?

805
00:53:35,813 --> 00:53:39,181
I want you to tell me who my father was.
What... Who was he?

806
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:43,185
I told you... Why did he leave me
when I was five years old, Ma? Why?

807
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:45,020
You're too young to understand.

808
00:53:45,022 --> 00:53:47,323
And that's all I hear over and over
again... that I'm too young, Ma.

809
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:50,893
Why does no one understand that I
don't have a father anymore, Ma?

810
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:52,695
And I don't have a husband!

811
00:53:54,265 --> 00:53:58,067
Like I told you before, Ma, just... I
just don't understand this anymore.

812
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,802
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

813
00:53:59,804 --> 00:54:01,971
I don't know
what people want from me.

814
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:05,975
Everybody talks about my father,
saying he's so... he's such a big man.

815
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:08,010
Like people... people want me
to follow in his footsteps.

816
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,112
Did I told you to follow
your father's footsteps?

817
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:12,548
No, Ma, but I'm not
talking about you.

818
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,251
Who wants you to follow
your father's footsteps?

819
00:54:15,253 --> 00:54:17,486
Who's putting all this shit
in your head?

820
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:19,021
'Cause I know it's not me.

821
00:54:21,125 --> 00:54:24,560
He was in the streets and he
got shot in the head, okay?

822
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:28,964
For being in the wrong place
with the wrong people.

823
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:31,800
I don't want nobody
knocking on that door...

824
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:34,637
telling me, "Your son
got shot in the head."

825
00:54:37,008 --> 00:54:39,041
How many times...

826
00:54:39,043 --> 00:54:42,378
in just one month you hear that
something happened to somebody...

827
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,480
out there in that street?

828
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,782
Somebody got shot.
Somebody got stabbed.

829
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:49,545
I ain't my fa... They found
somebody dead in a building.

830
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:56,325
Me and my father is
two different people, Mother.

831
00:54:56,327 --> 00:54:58,627
We two different people.
That's what you think.

832
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:01,597
You don't know, John.

833
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:43,839
Looking sharp.

834
00:56:11,969 --> 00:56:14,369
Think it was a setup?

835
00:56:18,342 --> 00:56:20,709
I don't think it was
a stray bullet.

836
00:56:24,448 --> 00:56:27,182
Who would wanna
kill him though?

837
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:29,151
Well, people get envious.

838
00:56:30,554 --> 00:56:34,123
He was handsome, he was
strong and he could fight.

839
00:56:35,493 --> 00:56:37,813
A stray bullet to the head.

840
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:41,063
I don't think so.

841
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,621
I'm gonna jump to you, okay?
Jump.

842
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:05,254
What the hell? That was like
a ballet jump right there.

843
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:06,989
I wasn't prepared for that.

844
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:09,425
I need to have weight
structure, weight balance.

845
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:11,860
Oh, my God, whatever.

846
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:13,729
Salsa is like the same thing.
Catching.

847
00:57:13,731 --> 00:57:15,664
Hey, hey, you gotta catch.

848
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,766
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

849
00:57:30,448 --> 00:57:32,815
<i>You know Primo
runs everything, right?</i>

850
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,817
<i>That's what people say.</i>

851
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,222
<i>But then my pop gets capped
and it's, like, bad luck?</i>

852
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:41,957
<i>What are you trying to say?</i>

853
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,027
How does my pops die
and nobody knows anything?

854
00:57:48,399 --> 00:57:49,965
What do you...

855
00:58:29,907 --> 00:58:33,408
Okay, so this is
what he looks like.

856
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,177
This is the man
you wanna look for.

857
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,312
And I don't even know
if he's gonna show up.

858
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:41,550
But if he does, just keep it calm.
I just don't want a scene.

859
00:58:41,552 --> 00:58:43,051
Just diffuse the situation.

860
00:58:45,489 --> 00:58:47,623
All the men. All the ladies.

861
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:50,259
Grab a hand, girls.
One, two, three!

862
00:58:51,695 --> 00:58:54,029
Oh, you gotta shake it better than that.
Let's go.

863
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,065
Get 'em up there!
Get 'em up there!

864
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:58,834
Whoo!

865
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:02,004
All the way around.
All the way around.

866
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,581
One more time.

867
00:59:12,583 --> 00:59:16,151
Big pose for that camera.
Give me a pose.

868
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:20,822
Looking good.
Let's go. Raise your hands!

869
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:24,359
And now my man.

870
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:29,197
For Rocky himself. Let's hear it for Adam.

871
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:34,403
Grab a handle. Grab a handle.

872
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:36,905
One, two, three!

873
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:38,840
<i>It's a coming-of-age thing.</i>

874
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:41,810
You know, the kid's gotta learn
a whole part of the Torah.

875
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:43,645
He's gotta sing it and read it.

876
00:59:43,647 --> 00:59:49,518
So he recites a mantra and, you
know, memorizes it and says it out,

877
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,153
and that makes him a man?

878
00:59:51,155 --> 00:59:53,889
It's kind of like a mantra. Yeah,
I never thought about it... Yeah.

879
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:56,658
Yeah, I mean... And we all know
it's not really being a man.

880
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,428
I mean, you're 13. He's got
enough problems, but...

881
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:01,330
It's kind of similar
to what I do.

882
01:00:02,733 --> 01:00:05,667
I recited and remembered
an oath, a pledge.

883
01:00:05,669 --> 01:00:08,670
Said it out loud
to my brothers.

884
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:11,273
Did my initiation, and...

885
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:14,876
Now, this is for what? Initiation
for... Being Blood, you know.

886
01:00:14,878 --> 01:00:17,312
Oh, okay. Had to fight
seven different dudes.

887
01:00:17,314 --> 01:00:21,116
What do you mean, at the same time?
Yeah. Shows strength.

888
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:25,354
When I changed and turned
Blood, I was 12.

889
01:00:25,356 --> 01:00:27,189
After that, you get an oath.

890
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:29,691
You get a pledge that you have
to recite, you gotta memorize.

891
01:00:29,693 --> 01:00:31,193
You know, back in the days,

892
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:33,562
you felt like, boom,
I just fought seven dudes.

893
01:00:33,564 --> 01:00:36,832
You know, I feel like I'm a man.
That's like my kid's age.

894
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:39,735
I was 12. He's 13.

895
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:43,057
Jesus Christ, he didn't
have to fight seven guys.

896
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,374
A lot of people
look at me and say,

897
01:00:45,376 --> 01:00:47,676
"You know, Prim, at 12
years old, you're a kid."

898
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:51,113
Behind that was I had nobody.

899
01:00:51,115 --> 01:00:53,882
And the only people that really
embraced me and showed me love...

900
01:00:53,884 --> 01:00:57,352
was dudes that my brother
knew, and, you know...

901
01:00:57,354 --> 01:00:59,721
I joined the life, you know.

902
01:00:59,723 --> 01:01:04,126
I made the decision that if I didn't
have the family at home that I wanted,

903
01:01:04,128 --> 01:01:07,562
that the family outside on the
streets, they accepted me.

904
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:09,398
And...

905
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:16,038
I can't give it up, but I'm
ready for a big change.

906
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,707
Like, I don't want the
same things for my kids.

907
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:21,543
You know, I don't want
my son to ever feel like...

908
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:24,579
the only choice he has
is the streets.

909
01:01:24,581 --> 01:01:26,248
You know?
That's why I take that time.

910
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,767
I'm getting money.

911
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,436
It'll be good tomorrow.

912
01:01:49,273 --> 01:01:51,873
Promised the kids
I'd take 'em to the park.

913
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:55,877
Oh, so that means you have to do it.
Yeah.

914
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,013
And they're not gonna
let you forget.

915
01:01:58,015 --> 01:02:01,049
No, especially Nevaeh
or Elijah.

916
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,097
Why are you with me?

917
01:02:15,966 --> 01:02:17,933
Why am I with you? Mm-hmm.

918
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:19,935
You make me happy.

919
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,440
What's up, baby? What up?

920
01:02:58,442 --> 01:03:00,208
What's good?

921
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,145
- Yo, you remember BB?
- Yeah.

922
01:03:03,147 --> 01:03:06,114
All right. You remember RayLo?
Yeah, what's up?

923
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,817
Go over to BB's, pick something
up and take it over to RayLo.

924
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:10,385
I could do that, man.

925
01:03:26,036 --> 01:03:28,970
We need to get this shit popping.
For real.

926
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,839
Yo, what up, yo?

927
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:34,676
What's good, RayLo?
What's going on, big man?

928
01:03:34,678 --> 01:03:37,212
Hear you working with Primo now.
Yeah, man. What's up?

929
01:03:37,214 --> 01:03:39,047
- Think you big time, yo?
- Shut the fuck up, man.

930
01:03:39,049 --> 01:03:42,050
Yeah, you pussy. Shut the fuck up, man.
What up, man?

931
01:03:42,052 --> 01:03:44,152
What you mean, shut the fuck up?
You heard me.

932
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,354
You know where you at right now?
I know exactly where I'm at.

933
01:03:46,356 --> 01:03:48,590
Where you at right now?
Where you at right now?

934
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:50,892
You gonna do something right now?
This is Lo's block, man.

935
01:03:50,894 --> 01:03:53,028
You work for Primo, man.
Shut the fuck up, man.

936
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,297
What happened, man? What up?
What you mean, what up?

937
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,899
Yo, man. Yo, keep your bitches tamed, yo.
You know where you at, man?

938
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:00,135
Keep your bitches tamed, yo.
What happened?

939
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:01,870
Chill out. Chill out.

940
01:04:01,872 --> 01:04:04,139
You got that?
With the business, man.

941
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,943
Hey, yo,

01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:10,312

what's up, man.

943
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,216
Be safe in these streets, man.

944
01:04:14,218 --> 01:04:16,351
Fuck you, man. Get
the fuck outta here.

945
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:19,087
Tell your boy
to take his tampon out, yo.

946
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,356
All right. Fuck outta here, yo.

Yo, P.

956
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,267
Man, that shit ain't
touched down yet.

957
01:05:05,269 --> 01:05:08,236
He left a hour ago though.

958
01:05:08,238 --> 01:05:11,139
Well, I guess you got
a problem, homey.

959
01:05:11,141 --> 01:05:13,382
All right. Heard.

960
01:05:14,645 --> 01:05:16,244
What up?

961
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:33,595
Yo, what's good?

01:05:33,597 --> 01:05:35,463
Hey.

963
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:37,999
What's up? Nothing.
Just hanging out.

964
01:05:38,001 --> 01:05:39,701
What up, Ang? Oh, hey.

965
01:05:39,703 --> 01:05:42,637
What are you doing? Man, I'm about
to... I gotta go run real quick.

966
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:45,373
Where are you going?

967
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:48,043
Don't ask questions, babe.
Just stop asking questions.

968
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:51,479
I'm good. You good?

969
01:05:51,481 --> 01:05:53,381
Yeah. All right.

970
01:05:54,451 --> 01:05:56,732
I'm gonna holla
at you, all right?

971
01:05:58,288 --> 01:06:00,822
Yo, Ang, I'm gonna
holla at you.

972
01:06:15,105 --> 01:06:18,625
What's up? We all good?
Yeah, we good.

973
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:22,877
Took the long route home, huh?

974
01:06:22,879 --> 01:06:25,213
I ain't know you was timing me.

975
01:06:26,483 --> 01:06:29,244
Why you looking at me like that?
What happened?

976
01:06:33,023 --> 01:06:35,256
What... What happened?

977
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:38,059
RayLo just called.

978
01:06:38,061 --> 01:06:39,894
He ain't get the package.

979
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:41,596
What?

980
01:06:41,598 --> 01:06:43,565
Had a nice stroll, huh?

981
01:06:43,567 --> 01:06:47,936
Nah... Yo, Primo, man,
I gave him the package.

982
01:06:47,938 --> 01:06:50,305
Well, seems like we
got a problem then.

983
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:58,113
Grip everybody up. I mean,
get 'em all together.

984
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:01,683
And check in on RayLo and
see what's up with that.

985
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:03,318
All right. Cool?

986
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:04,719
Yeah.

987
01:07:14,998 --> 01:07:16,564
Sit down, John.

988
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:28,676
I gave him the package.

989
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:35,483
If I find out otherwise, John,

990
01:07:37,354 --> 01:07:40,634
your pops is gonna roll over in
his grave right next to you.

991
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:47,328
Yo, Prim, man.

992
01:07:48,198 --> 01:07:51,399
I gave him that...
Stop... talking.

993
01:07:57,374 --> 01:07:59,941
I put a lot of faith in you.

994
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:02,343
You know that?

995
01:08:02,345 --> 01:08:04,279
You know what that means?

996
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,847
Come on, man, I gave him that...

997
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:07,449
Shut up.

998
01:08:14,858 --> 01:08:17,759
Look at me...

999
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,594
and listen.

1000
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:36,811
Everybody is
giving you respect...

1001
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:38,713
because of me.

1002
01:08:40,250 --> 01:08:42,730
Because of who your father was.

1003
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,960
This business...

1004
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,595
this out there...

1005
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:56,631
is based off one thing...

1006
01:08:57,968 --> 01:08:59,601
respect.

1007
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:06,774
Kasey. Benz.

1008
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:09,644
Vito. Midnight.

1009
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:14,749
They all work for me
because of respect.

1010
01:09:18,722 --> 01:09:20,355
You know why?

1011
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,492
Because they fear me.

1012
01:09:27,898 --> 01:09:29,864
Because if one slip up,

1013
01:09:31,768 --> 01:09:33,601
there are consequences.

1014
01:09:40,443 --> 01:09:44,479
Even RayLo, he knows that.

1015
01:09:44,481 --> 01:09:46,447
He wouldn't even think
of coming to me...

1016
01:09:46,449 --> 01:09:48,082
with that bullshit lie.

1017
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:49,784
I gave him... Shut...

1018
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:00,395
We been doing business
too long, too right.

1019
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:06,768
But you... these motherfuckers
is watching you.

1020
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:11,406
Then this happens?

1021
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:53,715
- What's good?
- What's going on?

1022
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:56,751
Talk to me. So what happened?

1023
01:10:56,753 --> 01:11:00,221
Your man ain't show up. Yo,
why you lying for, man?

1024
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:02,590
You already know
our history, man.

1025
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,793
Yo, fuck you, man. You
really lying right now.

1026
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:08,930
Yo, you better get your man.

1027
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:11,866
You really gonna believe him? You
really gonna believe him right now?

1028
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:13,801
Yo. Come on, man, this guy...

1029
01:11:13,803 --> 01:11:16,471
Shut the fuck up.

1030
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:32,754
So you're saying he's lying.

1031
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:36,591
That he stole the package.

1032
01:11:36,593 --> 01:11:38,793
And now he's saying he didn't.

1033
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:42,271
You know what that means?

1034
01:11:46,703 --> 01:11:48,536
Speak!

1035
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:51,018
I know you know what that mean.

1036
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:56,878
RayLo is lying to me right now.

1037
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,513
That's what you saying.

1038
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:02,850
Did he take what was mine?

1039
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:06,821
- Yeah.
- Son of a bitch.

1040
01:12:07,924 --> 01:12:09,557
Yo.

1041
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:11,392
Yo.

1042
01:12:12,028 --> 01:12:13,561
Yo. Kasey.

1043
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:15,263
Fuck this nigga.

1044
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:17,231
You already know.

1045
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:18,700
Get the fuck off.

1046
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:20,968
Come on.
Don't worry about that.

1047
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,370
Get the fuck off. It's done.

1048
01:12:58,675 --> 01:13:03,044
This out here...
this ain't no joke, man.

1049
01:13:06,883 --> 01:13:10,685
A young nigga like you...
you get bodied,

1050
01:13:10,687 --> 01:13:13,488
shit won't even make the news.

1051
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,611
You're just another number.

1052
01:13:18,428 --> 01:13:21,062
Nobody gonna care.

1053
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:24,832
Nobody gonna stop. Nothing.

1054
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:32,640
Back there with RayLo,

1055
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,547
I was just defending myself.

1056
01:13:44,888 --> 01:13:48,022
And I really don't care
what you think about it.

1057
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:55,062
Then you're a ballsy-ass kid.

1058
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:58,705
'Cause for once you
standing up for yourself.

1059
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:54,155
You know, me and your old man used
to come out here and kick back.

1060
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:57,725
Always at night though.

1061
01:14:58,995 --> 01:15:00,828
He liked this place.

1062
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,133
He used to take me here
at night too.

1063
01:15:14,377 --> 01:15:16,511
Let me ask you something.

1064
01:15:17,881 --> 01:15:20,715
What do you know about his murder?
What happened?

1065
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,433
I know what you know.

1066
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,955
Stray bullet.

1067
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,125
Wrong time,

1068
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:32,793
wrong place.

1069
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,067
Wrong time, wrong place.

1070
01:15:41,638 --> 01:15:44,071
I guess that's right where
you don't wanna be, huh?

1071
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,882
You know, sometimes...

1072
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:57,952
I feel like I'm in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

1073
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:01,289
You ever feel like that?

1074
01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:06,727
Son, that's where we were born.

1075
01:16:09,399 --> 01:16:11,866
You think this shit is funny?

1076
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:15,202
Your dad would be proud.

1077
01:16:15,838 --> 01:16:17,505
You look just like him.

1078
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:19,307
I don't look shit like him.

1079
01:16:27,784 --> 01:16:31,485
Looks like little man might
be growing up now, huh?

1080
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:33,654
I'm not playing, Primo.

1081
01:16:35,391 --> 01:16:37,291
I know how things work.

1082
01:16:37,293 --> 01:16:40,895
There's no such thing as a stray
bullet when you're involved.

1083
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:44,532
When people got beefs,
they settle them.

1084
01:16:44,534 --> 01:16:46,701
When my pops died,

1085
01:16:47,737 --> 01:16:50,071
it's like no one
had to pay for it.

1086
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:54,175
That's not how the boss man's
supposed to live, right?

1087
01:16:54,177 --> 01:16:55,743
That's what you taught me.

1088
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:57,878
Actions have consequences.

1089
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,614
Right?

1090
01:16:59,616 --> 01:17:01,649
But you know what, John?

1091
01:17:01,651 --> 01:17:05,086
It's not the first time I had a
gun pointed at my head, homey.

1092
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:08,737
I remember the first time.

1093
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,227
Enough with the stories, man.

1094
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:16,497
Tell me what happened.

1095
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:19,859
You're a big boy, John.
Figure it out.

1096
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,269
He got big.

1097
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,006
Too big.

1098
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:28,943
He didn't wanna do
business... the right way.

1099
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:33,080
Everybody has bosses.

1100
01:17:33,082 --> 01:17:35,449
Your pops act like
he ain't have any.

1101
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:37,652
So it was his time.

1102
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:41,055
Sad to say, it's just business.

1103
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,767
So what you gonna do now?

1104
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:48,395
What your pops would've done?

1105
01:17:49,399 --> 01:17:51,132
I ain't even know my pops.

1106
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:55,870
Maybe a basketball game.

1107
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:58,272
Maybe a trip to the beach
every two years.

1108
01:18:02,078 --> 01:18:04,345
But I thank you
for teaching me.

1109
01:18:05,314 --> 01:18:06,781
Now I know him.

1110
01:18:06,783 --> 01:18:08,749
I understand him.

1111
01:18:14,657 --> 01:18:17,858
I know exactly
what he would do right now...

1112
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,027
or what you would do.

1113
01:18:23,933 --> 01:18:26,100
But I'm not gonna even do that.

1114
01:19:11,447 --> 01:19:13,080
Wah!

1115
01:19:13,983 --> 01:19:15,382
Wah!

1116
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:18,419
Wah!

1117
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:20,461
Hah!

1118
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:26,260
Ahh!

1119
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:34,101
Ah!

1120
01:19:43,646 --> 01:19:45,179
I want ice cream!

1121
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:47,581
You want ice cream? Yeah.

1122
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:50,117
Ain't you just eat?
