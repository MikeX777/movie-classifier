00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,406
Narrator:
Once upon a time,

5
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:21,575
There was a land where
the warm light of day

6
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:28,416
Was in perfect balance with
the cool darkness of night

7
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:33,254
And all lived
together as one.

8
00:02:33,287 --> 00:02:36,324
To ensure that the perfect
harmony of this land

9
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:40,628
Was never disrupted, it was
arranged that king solter

10
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:45,333
Of the day would marry
princess dume of the night.

11
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:51,572
King solter, however, would not
accept an arranged marriage.

12
00:02:51,605 --> 00:02:56,744
He would only marry for love.

13
00:02:56,777 --> 00:03:05,619
And so he took the beautifully
luna to be his bride instead.

14
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:10,758
It seemed that things
couldn't be more perfect...

15
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,293
[Thunder]

16
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:17,465
Until princess dume appeared,
furious that king solter

17
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:22,603
Had chosen luna,
a common girl, over her.

18
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:27,708
No longer will
night and day live
in harmony as one.

19
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:45,426
From this day forward,
I, princess dume, shall
alone rule the night!

20
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:55,803
Narrator: As time passed so
did any hope that the day

21
00:03:55,836 --> 00:04:01,309
And night worlds would
ever be reunited...

22
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,944
Until one day...

24
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:09,750

Now the king is coming!

Did you hear?

26
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:13,287
I'm finally
a father!

[Yelling]

28
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,959
The king!

29

31
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,982

32
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:46,820

this is your daughter.

34
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:52,025
Oh, she is beautiful.

35
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,996
This is also
your daughter.

36
00:04:57,431 --> 00:05:00,334
Two daughters?

37
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:09,377
Luna, you've given me the two
most perfect children ever born.

38
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,512
What shall we name them?

39
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:16,384
Well, this one
is as calm and deep

40
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:19,853
As the silvery moon
on a summer's Eve.

41
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:23,657
This one is
as bright and lovely

42
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:26,727
As the golden
sun at dawn.

43
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,797
Eve and dawn.

44
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,632
Our daughters.

45
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,569
Make way! Make way!
The king is coming!

46
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,070
The king is...

47
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,439
Here.

48

[Laughter]

49
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:45,045
Cassy, meet the two
newest members of
our royal family.

50
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,914
Two?

51
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,917
Dawn and Eve.

52
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,720
Isn't it wonderful,
cassy?

53
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:55,055
Twins.

54
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:57,625
One from each world.

55
00:05:57,658 --> 00:06:00,961
This has never
happened before.

56
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:03,664
It's an omen.

57
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:09,570
Perhaps these girls are
meant to bring balance
back to our world.

58
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:14,542
[Laughing] But
all that in good time.

59
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:18,979
Right now it's time
to give these girls
a birthday gift.

60

Huh?

61
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,616
Ok.

Across the land and
with it spread hope.

98
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,704
Perhaps the princess twins
were a sign that the worlds

99
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:36,276
Of day and night might
at last be reunited.

100
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:42,115

Narrator: Desperate to find
his missing daughter,

142
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:44,324
King solter ordered every
member of his royal guard

143
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:48,361
To search the land
until they found her.

No stone was left unturned.

Until at last king solter
was forced to accept

148
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:08,015
The terrible truth...
princess Eve would
never be found.

149
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:14,587
Solter could not bear
the thought that dawn

150
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:18,058
Might someday hear
of the awful fate

151
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,428
Of her night world
mother and sister.

152

He believed the truth
would break her heart

153
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,968
Just as it had
broken his own.

154
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:33,240
And so the king passed
a decree forbidding anyone

155
00:14:33,273 --> 00:14:37,610
In the kingdom to speak
of the night world again.

156
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:44,918
And all things of that world
were hidden from sight forever.

157

night will come together

hiding, but we're
better at seeking.

find them soon.

00:16:27,754 --> 00:16:29,456
Of course she does.

184
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:32,625
Dawn's the best
at finding stuff.

185
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,428
Dawn's the best
at everything.

186
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:39,499
Thank you, Gemma,
but I did have a little
help from sparks there.

187
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,403
Hey, you should get
a baby dragon

188
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,704
For your birthday, dawn.

189
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:47,107
Don't be silly, cammy.

190
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:51,211
Princess dawn doesn't
want a baby gift like
that for her birthday.

191
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:53,580
A dragon isn't
a baby gift.

192
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:54,647
Yes, it is.

193
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,216
Is not.
Yes, it is.

194
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,085
Is not.
It is.

195
00:16:58,118 --> 00:16:59,619
Is not, not, not.

196
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,721
Stop it, you two.

197
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:05,092
A dragon is a perfectly
lovely gift, cammy.

198
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:10,263
However, it isn't
really what I want for
my birthday this year.

199
00:17:10,297 --> 00:17:13,066
What do you want, dawn?

200
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,169
Well, I'm not really sure.

201
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:19,172
You should get
a new dress with beads...

202
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,707
[Both talking at once]

203
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,575
Just one more
teensy game.

204
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:25,445
* I know that there's love

205
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:30,217
* I know that there's
more than what I see *

206
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:35,488
* I can feel it in the air

207
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:40,227
* something big is
out there for me *

208
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,199
* and the answers are clear

209
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,169
* it feels like I'm near

210
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:54,507
* and I won't stop until
they're in my reach *

211
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,345
* something tells me
there's a place *

212
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,480
* a whole new world

213
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:04,817
* that there's a better place

214
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:10,523
* because I don't believe
the sun just shines for me *

215
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:14,194
* one day I'll wake up
knowing everything *

216
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:19,866
* that's my dream

217
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:26,373
* that's my dream

218
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:30,410
* something tells me
there's a place *

219
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,512
* a whole new world

220
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:36,749
* that there's a better place

221
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:42,389
* because I don't believe
the sun just shines for me *

222
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:46,393
* one day I'll wake up
knowing everything *

223
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:52,165
* that's my dream

224
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:56,936
* that's my dream

225
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:02,875
* that's my dream

226
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:09,449
* that's my dream

227
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:10,483
Man: Dawn!

228
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,752
Whoa!

229
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:14,254
Hello, father.

230
00:19:14,287 --> 00:19:15,755
Where have you been?

231
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:16,856
I'm sorry.

232
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:18,425
I was just...

233
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,427
You were supposed
to be home hours ago.

234
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,295
There's no need to yell.

235
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,696
I am not yelling.

236
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,498
[Yipping]

237
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:28,201
Ohh.

238
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:30,503
I'm sorry, dawn.

239
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:34,407
But I've told you many
times how dangerous it is

240
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,576
On the other side
of that wall.

241
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,911
Why can't I just
see for myself?

242
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:42,349
You'll see the world outside
these walls soon enough.

243
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:03,603
Please, father,
I have so many questions

244
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:08,508
About life outside
the castle, about my mother.

245
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:14,881
There is no one
more important to me
than you are, dawn.

246
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:17,250
I just want
to protect you.

247
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:20,019
I'm not a child anymore.

248
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:22,422
If you won't tell me
what I want to know,

249
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:25,758
I'll just have to go
and find out for myself.

250
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:27,594
Dawn, stop!

251
00:20:27,627 --> 00:20:29,462
Come back here!

252
00:20:29,496 --> 00:20:30,830
Cassy, follow her.

253
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,432
Take her to her room.

254
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:36,269
Lock her up
if you have to.

255
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:38,271
But don't let her leave
the castle again.

256
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:41,674
[Muttering]
Yes, your highness.

257
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,327
[Whispered]
We should go back.

258
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,328
No, we shouldn't.

259
00:21:01,361 --> 00:21:02,562
Yes, we should.

260
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,664
We should not, should
not, should not.

261
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:06,799
Shh!

262
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,601
[Door closes]

263
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,510
[Door opens]

264
00:21:17,544 --> 00:21:19,479
[Door closes]

265
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:24,484
[Whispered]
This way, hurry.

266
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,954
I don't think
we should do this.

267
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:30,022
Besides,
the door is locked.

268
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,759
So, we'll just unlock it.

269
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,094
Cammy, you stole those!

270
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,829
I didn't steal them.

271
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,831
I just borrowed them
from cassy.

272
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,433
[Tapping]

273
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,373

274
00:21:46,406 --> 00:21:47,874
Sparks!
[Yipping]

275
00:21:47,907 --> 00:21:48,675
[All sigh]

276
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:52,011
You stop sneaking up
on us like that.

277
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,913
Ohh. Ah?

278
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,484
[Door squeaking]

279
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:05,725
Hmm, we need some light.

280
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:06,726
Here, sparks.

281
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,727
[Yipping]

282
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,397
Come here.
Here, boy. Fetch.

283
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,831
[Yipping]

284
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,569
Good boy!
Hurray!

285
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:18,805
Ah, good dragon.

286
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,007
[Yipping
and panting]

287
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:24,811
Wow, look at all this stuff.

288
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:27,079
You can't play
with those, cammy.

289
00:22:27,113 --> 00:22:29,115
Yes, I can.

290
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,650
Those things
aren't yours.

291
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,585
I'm not
going to hurt them.

292
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,554
They're still not yours.

293
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,040
[Gasps]

294
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:07,454
Wow!

295
00:23:07,487 --> 00:23:09,856
Look at that!

296
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,893
[Gasps] Ohh.

297
00:23:41,888 --> 00:23:44,657
She's beautiful.

298
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:52,832
She looks
like you, except
for the dark hair.

299
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,868
She really was
from the night world.

300
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:56,969
Shh!

301
00:23:57,003 --> 00:23:58,505
Night world?

302
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,474
Uh, this sure is
a pretty necklace.

303
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:03,209
What do you mean, night world?

304
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,011
She didn't mean anything.

305
00:24:05,044 --> 00:24:06,979
I'm not supposed
to talk about it.

306
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,147
Nobody is.

307
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,483
Tell me.

308
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,055
I thought you were my friends,

309
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,891
But friends don't
keep secrets from each other.

310
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:21,561
Do you promise not to
tell anyone we told you?

311
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:24,130
Cross your heart
and hope to find a
pixie in your shoe?

312
00:24:24,163 --> 00:24:25,898
I promise.

313
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:29,268
People say that
a long, long time ago,

314
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:34,140
The sun would
only shine for a few
hours every day.

315
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:39,746
Then it would disappear and
everything would go dark.

316
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,750
That's when
the day creatures would
hide and the creatures

317
00:24:43,783 --> 00:24:47,286
Of the night with their
glowing eyes and big,

318
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,758
Long teeth would come out
to terrorize the land.

319
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:55,828
My mother was one
of these horrible
night creatures?

320
00:24:55,862 --> 00:24:57,664
That's what I heard.

321
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:01,534
Where did all
the night creatures go?

322
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,970
What happened to them?

323
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,304
I'm not sure.

324
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:08,040
But legend says that
they're still living

325
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:13,913
In a world nearby, a
world of total darkness.

326
00:25:13,946 --> 00:25:16,583
Where?
Where is this world?

327
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:17,784
I don't know.

328
00:25:17,817 --> 00:25:20,519
I don't think anyone
knows for sure.

329
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:27,560
Well then, it's time
that someone found out.

330
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:33,733
[Wolf and wind howling]

331
00:25:43,843 --> 00:25:46,178
Where is that girl?!

332
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,881
Where is she?!

333
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:54,053
Look at my
poor sweet babies.

334
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:55,822
[Whining]

335
00:25:55,855 --> 00:26:00,092
Oh, no, no, no, they're
practically starving.

336
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,294
Gee, they don't look
hungry to me.

337
00:26:02,328 --> 00:26:03,896
Ohh!

338
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:06,666
I'll be the judge of that,
lieutenant ledem.

339
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:08,868
Of course,
your royalness.

340
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,605
Now, where is that girl?

341
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18,811
I'm here, your royalness.

342
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:22,014
Yes, so you are.

343
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:27,386
Tell me, child,
do I not feed you,

344
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,689
Give you a place to sleep,

345
00:26:29,722 --> 00:26:32,825
Allow you to do
chores for me?

346
00:26:32,859 --> 00:26:35,995
Yes, your royalness.

347
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:39,832
Then, why can you
not do a simple task

348
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:44,003
Like feeding
my sweet babies?!

349
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,005
But I did feed them.

350
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,841
Then feed them again!

351
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,810
Foolish child!

352
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,279
[Whining]

353
00:26:55,915 --> 00:27:00,052
I take such good care
of that child, ledem.

354
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,121
You do?

355
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:04,190
I mean, yes!

356
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:06,058
You do, you do!

357
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,361
You'd think she'd be more
grateful, wouldn't you?

358
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,898
Oh, yes, your royalness.

359
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:15,802
She should be singing
your praises... Like me.

360

* oh, I've been over

361
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:20,439

00:27:27,914 --> 00:27:30,717
That's quite
enough praise for now.

Go now!

368
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,219

angry with me?

00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:38,050
Oh, I cannot bear
to see you upset.

Come, bitter conduct,

to my rescue.

But who's going to rescue me

390
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,482
When dume sees those
nasty pictures you've
drawn on my walls?

391

Hmm, you're right.

392
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:15,287
She's going to be furious.

393
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,989
We should run away together.

What?

395
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,425
We can live in my cave.

396
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,493
Dume will never find us.

397
00:29:21,527 --> 00:29:24,463
It will be our
secret hideaway.

Oh, I can't do that, kylo.

In your sleep about
a beautiful world without dume.

She's not really so bad.

From those horrible

I was just a baby.

You've got to stop dreaming
and start living, Eve.

You idiot mongrel!

550
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:51,943
After her!

Aah! Gibber!

Oh!

554
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,103
Ah!

Aah!
Aah!

558
00:42:38,824 --> 00:42:41,326

560
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,063

[Gibberish]

562
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:05,917
Unh!

563
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:15,126
We've got you now,
you little puny.

[Neighing]

565
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:28,674

[Laughter]

571
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:56,702
Did you see the look
on that nippee's face

572
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,436
When I swooped in?

573
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,039
[Neighs]

574
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:05,276
I mean, when juniper
and I swooped in.

575
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:08,346
It was classic.

576
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:12,450
Dume must really
be mad to sic the night
beasts on you.

577
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:15,721
Hey! You're not Eve!

578
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:17,388
My name is dawn,

579
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:20,225
And I can't thank you
enough for rescuing me.

580
00:44:20,258 --> 00:44:23,461
Uh... I'm sorry.

581
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,130
I don't know who you...

582
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:26,732
I'm kylo.

583
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:30,802
Are you
a night creature, kylo?

584
00:44:30,836 --> 00:44:33,739
I guess you
could say that.

585
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:37,408
Boy, you sure do look
like my good friend Eve...

586
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:40,211
Same face, same eyes,

587
00:44:40,245 --> 00:44:43,381
Except for that funny
day world colored hair.

[Wolves howling]

589
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,754
Come on, we better
get you inside.

590
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:54,225
Welcome to my home, dawn.

591
00:44:58,496 --> 00:45:02,400
Kylo, this is amazing.

592
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:04,269
Ah, it's nothing really.

593
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:06,304
Do you live
here all alone?

594
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:08,106
Uh-huh.

595
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:11,142
I'm currently a bachelor.

596
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:12,744
[Gibberish]

597
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,814
Who is this?

598
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:17,182
That's Eve.

599
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,184
The girl
I was talking about.

600
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,518
The one that
looks just like you.

601
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,353
Does she live
around here?

602
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,189
She lives with dume.

603
00:45:24,222 --> 00:45:25,757
Dume?

604
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:29,194
The one who sent the
night beasts after me?

605
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,262
Yes, but Eve isn't like dume.

606
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:34,065
Eve is wonderful.

607
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:38,503
Like a single star
on a moonless night.

608
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:39,971
Would you like
to meet her?

609
00:45:40,005 --> 00:45:41,072
I could bring her here.

610
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,875
Are you sure you
can trust her?

611
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:46,477
Eve? I've known her forever.

612
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:49,280
I trust her with my life.

613
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:50,281
[Laughs]

614
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:07,098
Dawn?

615
00:46:07,132 --> 00:46:10,101
Dawn, open this door.

616
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,270
Dawn, it's your father.

617
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,341
[Gasps]

618
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:18,877
She's not here, cassy.

619
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:23,248
I distinctly told her she
was not to leave this castle.

620
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,883
Wait a minute.

621
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:27,052
Hold it, you two.

622
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:30,856
Do you girls know
where the princess might be?

623
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:33,158
Princess?
What princess?

624
00:46:33,191 --> 00:46:35,827
The last time we saw
her was yesterday
in the dungeon.

625
00:46:35,861 --> 00:46:37,095
Shh.

626
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,064
Dawn was in the dungeon?

627
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:40,498
It's all my fault.
I stole the keys.

628
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,333
I just wanted to help dawn.

629
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,502
And then we went to the
dungeon, and it was dark,

630
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:48,039
And sparks lit a torch,
and we found this room.

631
00:46:48,073 --> 00:46:50,608
And she asked us
all these questions
about the night world.

632
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,012
Cassy, she knows about luna.

633
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:57,482
What if she's gone looking
for the night world?

634
00:47:00,085 --> 00:47:02,020
[Laughter echoing]

635
00:47:18,103 --> 00:47:20,038
Eve?

636
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:25,643
Eve?

637
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,946
[Gasps] Who's there?

638
00:47:27,979 --> 00:47:30,949
It's ok, Eve,
it's just me.

639
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:32,250
Kylo.

640
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:33,551
Another bad dream?

641
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,887
Not bad really.

642
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,422
What's this?

643
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:38,423
Don't!

644
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:41,459
No wonder
you have nightmares.

645
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:44,429
[Men chanting]

646
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:47,132
There's no place
for her to hide.

647
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:49,634
We will search
and find our prey.

648
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:52,637
She won't live another day.

649
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:55,273
Searching hard
and searching wide.

650
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:58,609
There's no place
for her to hide.

651
00:47:58,643 --> 00:48:00,045
You better go, kylo.

652
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:02,113
Dume's in a dreadful mood.

653
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:04,515
There was an intruder
in the night world.

654
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,952
Huh.
I know all about that.

655
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:09,120
She came here
from the day world.

656
00:48:09,154 --> 00:48:11,056
It's a day creature?

657
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:14,292
Uh-huh. And you
won't believe this,

658
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:17,528
But she looks
exactly like you...

659
00:48:17,562 --> 00:48:18,529
Except for the hair.

660
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,098
Me?

661
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:26,938
The intruder is a girl
and you let her get away?

662
00:48:26,972 --> 00:48:29,174
Incompetence!

663
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:30,708
Someone helped her.

664
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,212
Who? Who helped her?

665
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,448
And you'd better
have an answer.

666
00:48:37,482 --> 00:48:42,620
It was that little
friend of Eve's... the one
with the flying horse.

667
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,290
We must find that brat.

668
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:48,393
He'll tell us
where the intruder is.

669
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:52,297
No one knows
where the boy lives,
your royalness.

670
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,132
Eve knows.

671
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:55,700
Right.

672
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:57,502
Eve knows.

673
00:48:57,535 --> 00:49:00,705
Of course,
she'll never tell us.

674
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:03,174
No, she'll never tell.

675
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:07,045
I'll have to be
very clever about this.

676
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:08,113
Ooh!

677
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:10,348
I love it when
you're clever.

678
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:11,382
Ooh!

679
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:12,683
Quiet!

680
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:17,455
It's time we pay Eve
a little visit.

681
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:20,591
Come on, Eve.

682
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,027
You have to meet her.

683
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,628
She's waiting for us
back at my cave.

684
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:27,165
No, kylo. Day creatures
are dangerous.

685
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:29,067
That's what dume says,

686
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,636
But this girl doesn't
look dangerous to me.

687
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,038
[Footsteps]

688
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:34,639
[Gasps]
It's dume.

689
00:49:34,672 --> 00:49:35,673
You'd better go,
kylo.

690
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:37,542
Hurry up!
[Indistinct]

691
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:39,677
I'll come back for you...

692
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,346
When dume is asleep.

693
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:42,680
Just go.

694
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:46,384
Oh, my dear, Eve.

695
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:48,286
Are you all right?

696
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,621
Yes, your royalness.

697
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,657
Thank goodness.

698
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,093
I was so worried.

699
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:58,429
An evil day creature
has invaded our world.

700
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:04,635
I... i heard there
was an intruder.

701
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,705
But are you sure
it's evil?

702
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:13,244
My poor innocent child,
it's a day creature.

703
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:15,746
Naturally, it's evil.

704
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,585
You see, a day creature
can take on any shape
to win your trust.

705
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:26,791
But sooner or later,
their true hideous
nature emerges.

706
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:29,794
Then creep
into your room

707
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:31,162
And snatch you...

708
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:32,063
[Gasps]

709
00:50:32,097 --> 00:50:36,567
Right out of your bed
and carry you away!

710
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:40,605
Eve, dear, you
don't know anything

711
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:44,742
About this creature
who has invaded
our world, do you?

712
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:47,445
No. Of course you don't.

713
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:50,481
You would tell me
if you did, hmm?

714
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:56,254
You would never risk
someone being hurt
by such a dreadful beast.

715
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:57,288
Hurt?

716
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:58,623
No.

717
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,258
Then tell me what you know.

718
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:05,596
I...My friend, kylo,
he saw the creature.

719
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,098
She's in his cave.

720
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:08,499
Oh, dear.

721
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:11,469
I'm afraid your friend
is in grave danger.

722
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:14,672
Oh, I would love

But I don't know
where he lives.

Oh, he lives in the grotto

Aren't you clever?

My father was right

00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:13,198
I never should
have come here.

743

And I put you

Why are you here?

I don't see how
that's your business.

760
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:06,851
It's my world.

Was it that ridiculous
king solter?

I won't have you speak
of my father that way.

Oh, yes, of course.

00:53:23,968 --> 00:53:27,272
I should have recognized
those eyes...

And what's this?

770
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:36,914

Eve's a traitor.

No. Dume's gone.

brought back your sister...

910
01:04:03,107 --> 01:04:05,876
How quaint.

911
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:09,213
A family reunion.

912
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:12,016
Uh-huh. Uhh!

913
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,518
You, you devil!

914
01:04:16,153 --> 01:04:18,889
You were supposed
to marry me.

915
01:04:18,923 --> 01:04:21,525
Make me your queen.

916
01:04:21,558 --> 01:04:23,060
You took my luna.

917
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,062
My life away from me!

918
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:29,199
My, my. Our first
lover's quarrel.

919
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:30,901
You monster!

920
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:54,925
Stay away from my family!

921
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,226
Uh!

922
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:57,427
Uh!

923
01:04:57,461 --> 01:04:58,562
[Laughing]

924
01:04:58,595 --> 01:04:59,563
Father!

[Gasps]

926
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:08,238
Let go of him!

927
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:11,976
Oh, what a tangled web
we weave!

928
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:12,977
Look out!

929
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:14,311
[Laughing]

930
01:05:14,344 --> 01:05:15,946
[Screaming]

931
01:05:30,194 --> 01:05:37,101
Now the power of day
and night will be mine
and mine alone!

932
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:38,435
[Laughing]

933
01:05:43,707 --> 01:05:45,609
Do something, cassy.

934
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,544
Dume will get
you powerful.

935
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,147
She has the amulets.

936
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:54,518
Uh... The power isn't
in the amulets.

937
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:59,123
It's in our hearts.

938
01:05:59,156 --> 01:06:02,726
When the hearts
of day and night

939
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:07,998
Come together in love,
the world is one.

940
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:15,539
Dawn, Eve...

941
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:22,179
Together the power is yours.

942
01:07:03,787 --> 01:07:07,524
Quickly, there's
not much time!

943
01:07:12,396 --> 01:07:13,763
[Hissing]

944
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:19,469
Dearest solter, don't you
want to kiss your bride?

945
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:20,470
Uh!

946
01:07:20,504 --> 01:07:21,738
No, stop!

947
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:24,708
You ungrateful little child!

948
01:07:24,741 --> 01:07:28,545
I should have finished
you both off, along
with your mother...

949
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:31,248
The precious luna.

950
01:07:31,281 --> 01:07:33,650
Never mention
our mother's name again.

951
01:07:33,683 --> 01:07:35,652
Let our father go!

952
01:07:35,685 --> 01:07:37,654
You want him?

953
01:07:37,687 --> 01:07:39,756
You can have him!

954
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:40,757
No!

955
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:44,161
[Laughing]

956
01:07:44,194 --> 01:07:46,163
Ah.

957
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:52,136
Now, to finish
what I started!

958
01:07:52,169 --> 01:07:58,142
When the hearts
of day and night
come together,

959
01:07:58,175 --> 01:08:02,246
The world is one!

960
01:08:03,513 --> 01:08:04,481
What?

961
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:06,883
What's wrong now?

962
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,619
Why isn't it working?

963
01:08:09,653 --> 01:08:11,588
Where is my power?

964
01:08:11,621 --> 01:08:16,393
Where is my power?!

965
01:08:16,426 --> 01:08:18,595
You have no power.

966
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:22,866
Ohh!

967
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:25,435
[Grunting]

968
01:08:27,171 --> 01:08:29,406
I'm sorry
for you, dume.

969
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:31,641
I don't want your pity.

970
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:39,649
Dume, take my hand.

971
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:42,452
Eve, my sweet.

972
