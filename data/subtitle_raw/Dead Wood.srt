2
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Rob?

3
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Rob.

4
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Rob.

5
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Rob.

6
00:24:43,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Rob.

7
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh, hi.

8
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

9
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You've got
a lot of stuff.

10
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, it's just
the tent mostly.

11
00:32:43,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I wasn't sure
what I needed to bring.

12
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Just a sleeping bag
and a towel, really.

13
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Do you do this a lot?

14
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:22,000
No, I've only used
the tent twice...

15
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:38,000
...for Glastonbury.

16
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Oh, good.

17
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Glad I'm not
the only novice.

18
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm not too good
with this whole...

19
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:59,000
...communing-with-nature
thing.

20
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:50,000
You guys ready
for an adventure?

21
00:40:50,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Sort of.

22
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:29,000
This is gonna be
so much fun.

23
00:41:53,000 --> 00:42:03,000
All right, Webb?

24
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:24,000
All right, mate?
How's it going?

25
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Yeah, not bad, not bad.

26
00:42:39,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Hi, Webb.
Nice to meet you.

27
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:21,000
- Good to meet you too, Jess.
- Cool van.

28
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Thanks.
She's my baby.

29
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Hey, I thought
I was your baby.

30
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:22,000
No, you're my best girl.
Come here.

31
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Everyone comfortable?

32
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Hi, and welcome
to 'The Dave Peacock Show'.

33
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:39,000
Baby, look at me.
Look at me.

34
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:56,000
- Smile.
- It's another beautiful day tomorrow...

35
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:23,000
...and Dave just walked into the studio
in his Bermuda shorts.

36
01:06:51,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Guys, sit next to
each other...

37
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:30,000
...just a bit closer,
a bit closer.

38
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Don't be shy.

39
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Aww, you two make
such a nice couple.

40
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Put your arm
around her.

41
01:08:41,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Come on.
Now say cheese.

42
01:13:42,000 --> 01:14:10,000
We'll have to hike pretty fast if we
want to get to the lake by dark.

43
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:31,000
How far is it?

44
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Not far.

45
01:14:51,000 --> 01:15:20,000
But you don't want to be walking
through the woods at night.

46
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:27,000
- Better?
- Much.

47
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Oi!

48
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Oh, right.
I've had it.

49
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Right, come on, man.

50
01:21:49,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Can't you get me?

51
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Dick.

52
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Don't be so childish.

53
01:22:49,000 --> 01:23:07,000
What's the matter?
Are you gonna start crying?

54
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:36,000
- Oh my... Right.
- Crybaby crybaby.

55
01:23:50,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Good for you.
You're crying.

56
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:23,000
For fuck's sake, Milk,
you want to stop that?

57
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:53,000
It's Lar... Can you
not see it's Larri?

58
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Careful.
Webb's driving.

59
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:44,000
It's all right.

60
01:25:45,000 --> 01:26:10,000
You don't have to show off
in front of Jess.

61
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You want to drive?

62
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:58,000
What did you hit?

63
01:31:45,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Jess.

64
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Poor thing.

65
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Should we take it to a vet?

66
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:43,000
It won't make it.

67
01:39:43,000 --> 01:40:03,000
What?

68
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:37,000
You're not gonna
kill it, are you?

69
01:40:38,000 --> 01:41:07,000
Webb, you can't.

70
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:34,000
It's in pain.
It's the best thing.

71
01:57:47,000 --> 01:58:18,000
Come on, everybody out.
We're here.

72
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Finally.

73
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:58,000
Jess, look.

74
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:16,000
Over there.

75
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:39,000
- It's a weasel. Squirrels are up there.
- Lovely.

76
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Come on.

77
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:51,000
How did they get
all the way out here.

78
02:20:51,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Must be a road nearby.

79
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:17,000
No.

80
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:42,000
The only road's the one
we came in on.

81
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:34,000
You can't drive
through the woods...

82
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:53,000
...not this deep.

83
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:45,000
They don't belong here,
do they?

84
02:27:45,000 --> 02:28:03,000
It's weird, isn't it?

85
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:50,000
You were right...

86
02:28:51,000 --> 02:29:13,000
...about the deer, I mean.

87
02:29:36,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Oh my God.

88
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:20,000
What?

89
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:45,000
It wasn't me.

90
02:30:54,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Shit.

91
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:55,000
What's wrong?

92
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:19,000
We've got to go back
to the van.

93
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:38,000
- What have you left?
- My camera.

94
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:57,000
I must have left it
on the dash.

95
02:32:57,000 --> 02:33:16,000
Christ, Larri, I thought
it was important.

96
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:36,000
It is important.

97
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Come on.

98
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:59,000
Seriously, I'll teach you
a few basic chords.

99
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Why not?

100
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:36,000
You just do that.
That's a "C".

101
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:52,000
It's easy.

102
02:38:53,000 --> 02:39:15,000
I'm not very musical,
to be honest.

103
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:48,000
You can make it out of
pretty much anything...

104
02:41:49,000 --> 02:42:07,000
...leaves, twigs,
anything you find.

105
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:23,000
It's really quite
effective as well.

106
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:42,000
- Really?
- Yeah yeah.

107
02:42:43,000 --> 02:43:01,000
What's Milk doing?

108
02:43:24,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Dick.

109
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Milk, what are you doing?

110
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Eggs for breakfast.

111
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:49,000
Come on, mate, get down.
It's not safe up there.

112
02:46:50,000 --> 02:47:04,000
Milk, don't be
so stupid.

113
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Larri, tell him
to get down.

114
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Milk, you come down here
right this instant.

115
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I got some.

116
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:43,000
I got some.

117
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:32,000
You hear that?

118
02:55:53,000 --> 02:56:15,000
Go go!

119
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:39,000
Milk, come on, get up.

120
02:56:40,000 --> 02:57:03,000
Come on, let's go.

121
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:19,000
Come here.
Are you all right?

122
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:31,000
This is weird.

123
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Be careful now.

124
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:38,000
Hey, Jess, do you want
to have a look down there?

125
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:44,000
Hello?

126
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:24,000
They've probably gone
for a walk.

127
03:20:37,000 --> 03:21:04,000
Looks like they've been
gone some time.

128
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:25,000
Maybe something
happened to them.

129
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:49,000
- Like what?
- Like an accident.

130
03:21:49,000 --> 03:22:03,000
Shouldn't we tell
someone?

131
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:23,000
Tell who?

132
03:23:07,000 --> 03:23:30,000
No signal.

133
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:55,000
We are in the middle
of the woods.

134
03:24:15,000 --> 03:24:47,000
All right, we'll come back tomorrow,
see if they're around, yeah?

135
03:24:48,000 --> 03:25:06,000
Come on,
let's get moving.

136
03:25:07,000 --> 03:25:29,000
It'll be dark soon.
We've got a fair way to go yet.

137
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:44,000
It's really nice
out here, isn't it?

138
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:43,000
It's really quiet
and peaceful.

139
03:31:44,000 --> 03:32:08,000
A bit spooky, though.

140
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:27,000
Yeah, but look
at the stars.

141
03:32:28,000 --> 03:33:01,000
You don't get that
in the city.

142
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:21,000
Oh, it's incredible.

143
03:34:43,000 --> 03:35:11,000
Anyone fancy a smoke?

144
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:51,000
There you go...

145
03:37:52,000 --> 03:38:09,000
...for you, Princess.

146
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:34,000
Aw, thanks, sweetheart.

147
03:51:03,000 --> 03:51:26,000
Stop it.

148
03:51:27,000 --> 03:51:55,000
Stop it.
Leave me alone.

149
04:05:12,000 --> 04:05:37,000
Ugh, that's it.

150
04:05:38,000 --> 04:05:55,000
I'm gonna lock myself
in the tent.

151
04:05:56,000 --> 04:06:13,000
There are
far too many things...

152
04:06:13,000 --> 04:06:54,000
...creeping or
crawling around out here.

153
04:06:54,000 --> 04:07:17,000
- 'Night.
- Good night.

154
04:07:18,000 --> 04:07:41,000
Good night, all.

155
04:08:00,000 --> 04:08:27,000
You coming to bed?

156
04:08:43,000 --> 04:09:02,000
Suppose, if I have to.

157
04:09:49,000 --> 04:10:16,000
But we haven't told
the scary campfire stories yet.

158
04:10:17,000 --> 04:10:46,000
Don't forget
to put the fire out.

159
04:12:32,000 --> 04:13:05,000
I think I'll crash too.

160
04:14:27,000 --> 04:14:51,000
Well, I ain't sitting
out here on my own.

161
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:53,000
- Oi.
- Hey.

162
04:25:30,000 --> 04:25:49,000
Oh, baby.

163
04:26:48,000 --> 04:27:07,000
You okay?

164
04:27:07,000 --> 04:27:27,000
Great.

165
04:27:27,000 --> 04:27:46,000
You?

166
04:27:46,000 --> 04:28:08,000
Yeah, fine.

167
04:29:36,000 --> 04:29:50,000
Baby.

168
04:30:32,000 --> 04:31:01,000
Your cock is so big.

169
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:49,000
I love your body, Larri.

170
04:32:47,000 --> 04:33:06,000
I want you inside me.

171
04:36:19,000 --> 04:36:59,000
Sorry.

172
04:37:22,000 --> 04:37:57,000
I'm sorry.
I'm just not very...

173
04:37:58,000 --> 04:38:18,000
Just...

174
04:41:01,000 --> 04:41:19,000
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, baby.

175
04:41:20,000 --> 04:41:41,000
- God, I love you.
- How much?

176
04:41:42,000 --> 04:42:02,000
More than anything.
More than your mom.

177
04:42:03,000 --> 04:42:22,000
Oh.

178
04:44:04,000 --> 04:44:32,000
What the fuck was that?

179
04:44:32,000 --> 04:44:52,000
Can you see
anything?

180
04:44:52,000 --> 04:45:10,000
Nothing.

181
04:46:00,000 --> 04:46:18,000
You don't reckon
it was Milk and Jess...

182
04:46:19,000 --> 04:46:33,000
...fucking around
with us, do you?

183
04:46:33,000 --> 04:47:09,000
I suppose it could be.

184
04:48:01,000 --> 04:48:20,000
You should go
and check on them.

185
04:48:48,000 --> 04:49:07,000
Will you be all right?

186
04:49:08,000 --> 04:49:40,000
You're only
a few feet away.

187
04:50:55,000 --> 04:51:07,000
Webb.

188
04:51:07,000 --> 04:51:29,000
What?

189
04:51:29,000 --> 04:51:51,000
Be careful.

190
04:58:47,000 --> 04:59:08,000
- Wait.
- Get the fuck off me.

191
04:59:54,000 --> 05:00:19,000
- Why did you attack me?
- I didn't know who it was.

192
05:00:19,000 --> 05:00:38,000
Anyway, you shouldn't
play stupid games.

193
05:00:38,000 --> 05:00:57,000
What was
the scream for?

194
05:00:57,000 --> 05:01:16,000
We didn't scream.

195
05:01:17,000 --> 05:01:35,000
We thought it was you
messing around...

196
05:01:36,000 --> 05:01:54,000
...trying to scare us.

197
05:01:54,000 --> 05:02:11,000
That wasn't you?

198
05:02:12,000 --> 05:02:33,000
That's what she said.

199
05:02:54,000 --> 05:03:24,000
So if you didn't scream...

200
05:03:24,000 --> 05:03:47,000
...who did?

201
05:04:03,000 --> 05:04:32,000
I'm not having fun anymore.

202
05:04:33,000 --> 05:04:55,000
Maybe we should make
another fire.

203
05:04:56,000 --> 05:05:19,000
No, the ground's too wet.
We need to gather more sticks anyway.

204
05:05:20,000 --> 05:05:44,000
I think we all better
get back inside.

205
05:05:44,000 --> 05:05:56,000
Yeah, I think
she's right.

206
05:05:57,000 --> 05:06:22,000
I think we should
stay together.

207
05:06:22,000 --> 05:06:39,000
The tents aren't
big enough.

208
05:06:40,000 --> 05:06:56,000
I mean...

209
05:06:57,000 --> 05:07:16,000
I think it's best
if we all get back inside.

210
05:07:16,000 --> 05:07:35,000
- Wait, but...
- That is decided.

211
05:07:35,000 --> 05:07:54,000
Come on, let's get inside.

212
05:08:15,000 --> 05:08:37,000
Webb...

213
05:08:38,000 --> 05:09:08,000
...really, what do you
think it was?

214
05:15:42,000 --> 05:16:01,000
Dick.

215
05:20:50,000 --> 05:21:05,000
I'm sorry.

216
05:21:05,000 --> 05:21:29,000
You were sleeping.
I was very hungry.

217
05:21:30,000 --> 05:22:02,000
Hey, don't worry.
Help yourself.

218
05:22:26,000 --> 05:22:44,000
I'm Webb.

219
05:22:45,000 --> 05:23:03,000
What's your name?

220
05:23:04,000 --> 05:23:24,000
Ketsy.

221
05:23:24,000 --> 05:24:03,000
Mm, making breakfast?
You're such a sweetheart.

222
05:24:04,000 --> 05:24:24,000
That's just Larri.

223
05:24:25,000 --> 05:24:59,000
Larri, meet Ketsy.

224
05:25:15,000 --> 05:25:39,000
You look frozen.

225
05:27:02,000 --> 05:27:18,000
Thank you.

226
05:28:24,000 --> 05:28:41,000
What's going on?

227
05:31:03,000 --> 05:31:23,000
- Are you here on your own?
- Let her eat, babe.

228
05:31:24,000 --> 05:31:48,000
It's okay.

229
05:32:04,000 --> 05:32:36,000
It must seem strange...
...me just appearing.

230
05:32:37,000 --> 05:33:06,000
I was camping
not far from here...

231
05:33:06,000 --> 05:33:25,000
...with my boyfriend.

232
05:33:25,000 --> 05:33:57,000
We were together,
playing chess in the tent.

233
05:33:58,000 --> 05:34:30,000
Rob ran out
to check the fire...

234
05:34:30,000 --> 05:34:53,000
...and he was gone.

235
05:34:53,000 --> 05:35:22,000
So he left you
out here on your own?

236
05:35:22,000 --> 05:35:41,000
He wouldn't.

237
05:35:41,000 --> 05:36:09,000
He was just gone.

238
05:36:10,000 --> 05:36:24,000
We need to get you
to the police.

239
05:36:25,000 --> 05:36:48,000
No, I have to find him.

240
05:36:49,000 --> 05:37:19,000
I can't leave.

241
05:37:20,000 --> 05:37:39,000
Well, we'll help.
If we all search...

242
05:37:39,000 --> 05:37:54,000
...we'll find him soon
enough, don't worry.

243
05:37:55,000 --> 05:38:20,000
Would you like
to get cleaned up?

244
05:38:21,000 --> 05:38:46,000
There's a lake
just through those trees.

245
05:38:46,000 --> 05:39:19,000
- I'll wash there.
- Just through the trees?

246
05:39:20,000 --> 05:39:48,000
No, we passed that way last night.
We would have seen it.

247
05:39:49,000 --> 05:40:07,000
I passed it this morning.

248
05:40:07,000 --> 05:40:33,000
Let's go take a look.

249
05:40:33,000 --> 05:41:05,000
Once we've cleared up...

250
05:41:05,000 --> 05:41:37,000
...we will find your boyfriend.

251
05:44:06,000 --> 05:44:30,000
Is it just me,
or is Ketsy a bit odd?

252
05:44:31,000 --> 05:45:03,000
I suppose, a bit.

253
05:45:03,000 --> 05:45:24,000
It just all sounds
so strange...

254
05:45:25,000 --> 05:45:54,000
...the whole
missing-boyfriend thing.

255
05:46:19,000 --> 05:46:36,000
Come on.

256
05:52:52,000 --> 05:53:33,000
So are you guys
still up for a swim?

257
05:53:49,000 --> 05:54:12,000
I bet it's cold.

258
05:54:13,000 --> 05:54:34,000
Don't be such an old lady,
come on.

259
05:54:35,000 --> 05:54:55,000
No, I might go in later.

260
05:54:56,000 --> 05:55:24,000
Yeah, I think I might
stay out here with you.

261
05:55:24,000 --> 05:55:49,000
Well, we're
here now, so...

262
05:58:57,000 --> 05:59:17,000
Come on.

263
06:06:48,000 --> 06:07:07,000
Are you not going in?

264
06:07:07,000 --> 06:07:26,000
No.

265
06:07:26,000 --> 06:07:46,000
I can't swim.

266
06:07:46,000 --> 06:08:23,000
- You can't swim?
- No.

267
06:08:23,000 --> 06:08:47,000
So why did you want
to come to the lake?

268
06:08:48,000 --> 06:09:13,000
'Cause you were.

269
06:11:20,000 --> 06:11:44,000
Larri...

270
06:11:44,000 --> 06:12:07,000
...we're gonna go
for a walk.

271
06:12:08,000 --> 06:12:38,000
You take good care
of my little cousin.

272
06:12:39,000 --> 06:12:58,000
We won't go far.

273
06:15:34,000 --> 06:15:52,000
So are you happy
to be here?

274
06:15:53,000 --> 06:16:26,000
Yeah, it's nice to be
away from the city.

275
06:16:27,000 --> 06:16:53,000
Yeah, but...

276
06:16:54,000 --> 06:17:25,000
...are you happy
to be here with me?

277
06:19:12,000 --> 06:19:30,000
I'm hungry.

278
06:19:31,000 --> 06:19:50,000
You should have had
some breakfast.

279
06:19:50,000 --> 06:20:09,000
I'm gonna have some now.
Are you coming?

280
06:20:10,000 --> 06:20:40,000
Um, no, I'm gonna stay in
for a bit longer.

281
06:20:40,000 --> 06:21:12,000
Don't you wanna dry me up
and rub me down?

282
06:21:13,000 --> 06:21:43,000
Um...

283
06:21:43,000 --> 06:22:03,000
I'll do it later.

284
06:26:48,000 --> 06:27:09,000
Hey, feeling better?

285
06:29:12,000 --> 06:29:31,000
So when we get back
to the city...

286
06:29:31,000 --> 06:29:55,000
...do you want
to go out properly?

287
06:29:55,000 --> 06:30:25,000
Yeah, I'd like that.

288
06:34:38,000 --> 06:35:03,000
I'm not gonna dunk you.
Let's go together, all right?

289
06:35:04,000 --> 06:35:35,000
- Okay okay.
- One, two, three.

290
06:38:54,000 --> 06:39:15,000
- One, two, three.
- Okay, again.

291
06:40:52,000 --> 06:41:12,000
All right, one more time.

292
06:41:13,000 --> 06:41:40,000
- Again.
- One, two, three.

293
06:46:57,000 --> 06:47:17,000
Webb?

294
06:47:59,000 --> 06:48:23,000
- What?
- Look.

295
06:48:24,000 --> 06:48:42,000
What?

296
06:48:43,000 --> 06:49:04,000
There was somebody there.

297
06:49:28,000 --> 06:49:46,000
There's nobody there.

298
06:50:06,000 --> 06:50:26,000
There's no one there.
It's fine... Just us.

299
06:50:26,000 --> 06:50:45,000
They were watching us.

300
06:51:03,000 --> 06:51:23,000
There's nobody there.

301
06:51:23,000 --> 06:51:42,000
I think we should
go back to the lake.

302
06:51:42,000 --> 06:52:00,000
What?
There's no one.

303
06:52:01,000 --> 06:52:19,000
Milk, I want to go back
to the lake.

304
06:52:19,000 --> 06:52:38,000
But there's no one there.

305
06:52:38,000 --> 06:52:58,000
Do you want me to go
and have a look?

306
06:53:23,000 --> 06:53:49,000
Something just feels wrong.

307
06:55:27,000 --> 06:55:46,000
Webb!

308
06:57:07,000 --> 06:57:37,000
Webb! Webb!

309
07:03:10,000 --> 07:03:31,000
Could have been anything,
a trick of the light.

310
07:03:32,000 --> 07:04:00,000
- Larri?
- What's wrong?

311
07:04:01,000 --> 07:04:14,000
I can't find him.

312
07:04:14,000 --> 07:04:30,000
He went under.
I can't find him.

313
07:04:31,000 --> 07:04:56,000
- Webb?
- He's just messing about.

314
07:04:57,000 --> 07:05:12,000
Jess just saw someone
in the woods.

315
07:05:12,000 --> 07:05:40,000
No, I was right here.
I saw him.

316
07:05:40,000 --> 07:06:07,000
He was in the lake.
He went under.

317
07:06:07,000 --> 07:06:42,000
I can't find him.
I can't find him.

318
07:06:43,000 --> 07:07:03,000
Larri, I don't understand.
You're not making sense.

319
07:07:04,000 --> 07:07:30,000
He's gone.

320
07:07:30,000 --> 07:07:51,000
Do you think he drowned?

321
07:08:15,000 --> 07:08:44,000
- Let's get back to camp.
- And do what?

322
07:08:44,000 --> 07:09:11,000
We'll decide
when we get there.

323
07:09:12,000 --> 07:09:27,000
Come on.

324
07:13:44,000 --> 07:14:14,000
Where are the tents?

325
07:15:32,000 --> 07:15:49,000
This is the place,
isn't it?

326
07:15:50,000 --> 07:16:05,000
I'm sure it is.

327
07:16:05,000 --> 07:16:23,000
It's got to be
some kind of joke.

328
07:16:23,000 --> 07:16:47,000
But the whole
camp's gone.

329
07:16:47,000 --> 07:17:11,000
It's just like
my boyfriend.

330
07:17:11,000 --> 07:17:34,000
Did you see what happened?

331
07:17:34,000 --> 07:17:58,000
It's like she says...

332
07:17:59,000 --> 07:18:18,000
...we went swimming...

333
07:18:19,000 --> 07:18:41,000
...then he disappeared...

334
07:18:42,000 --> 07:19:08,000
...gone just like before.

335
07:19:08,000 --> 07:19:26,000
It doesn't make
any sense.

336
07:19:26,000 --> 07:19:52,000
You get the police.
I'll stay here with Larri.

337
07:19:53,000 --> 07:20:21,000
No, we stick together...

338
07:20:22,000 --> 07:20:45,000
...all of us.

339
07:26:08,000 --> 07:26:40,000
Are you sure we're going
in the right direction?

340
07:26:41,000 --> 07:26:59,000
I'm sure.

341
07:27:00,000 --> 07:27:22,000
Where's the map?

342
07:27:22,000 --> 07:27:46,000
It was at the camp.

343
07:28:11,000 --> 07:28:30,000
But we've been walking
for hours.

344
07:28:30,000 --> 07:28:53,000
It didn't take this long
to get to the lake.

345
07:28:54,000 --> 07:29:12,000
I guess we're just
moving slower.

346
07:29:13,000 --> 07:29:32,000
Anyway, the woods
aren't that big.

347
07:29:33,000 --> 07:29:52,000
We've got to come
across the road soon.

348
07:32:32,000 --> 07:32:47,000
Water?

349
07:32:48,000 --> 07:33:07,000
Yes, please.

350
07:33:56,000 --> 07:34:15,000
Do you know
what's going on?

351
07:34:33,000 --> 07:34:59,000
Jess saw someone
in the woods.

352
07:34:59,000 --> 07:35:23,000
Wouldn't be your
boyfriend, would it?

353
07:35:24,000 --> 07:35:40,000
What?

354
07:35:41,000 --> 07:35:59,000
Well, you said
he just disappeared.

355
07:36:00,000 --> 07:36:19,000
Maybe he followed you
to us.

356
07:36:19,000 --> 07:36:43,000
Maybe he's out there
right now, watching us...

357
07:36:43,000 --> 07:36:57,000
...and waiting.

358
07:36:58,000 --> 07:37:22,000
But even if
I did see him...

359
07:37:22,000 --> 07:37:42,000
...he couldn't have been
at the lake too.

360
07:38:08,000 --> 07:38:27,000
Just tell us,
is it your boyfriend...

361
07:38:28,000 --> 07:38:47,000
...running around
the woods?

362
07:39:12,000 --> 07:39:39,000
This is pointless.
Shall we just carry on?

363
07:48:03,000 --> 07:48:22,000
Webb?

364
07:48:23,000 --> 07:48:42,000
It's Webb.

365
07:48:42,000 --> 07:48:54,000
Larri, no.

366
07:48:55,000 --> 07:49:18,000
Wait here.

367
07:49:19,000 --> 07:49:30,000
Larri!

368
07:50:00,000 --> 07:50:14,000
Webb.

369
07:50:15,000 --> 07:50:42,000
Larri. Larri.

370
07:51:20,000 --> 07:51:36,000
Webb.

371
07:51:37,000 --> 07:52:02,000
Larri.

372
07:52:13,000 --> 07:52:31,000
Webb.

373
07:52:58,000 --> 07:53:16,000
Larri, come back.
What are you doing?

374
07:53:17,000 --> 07:53:37,000
He was right here.
I saw him.

375
07:53:38,000 --> 07:53:57,000
- Who?
- It was Webb.

376
07:53:58,000 --> 07:54:14,000
We don't know
who's out there.

377
07:54:15,000 --> 07:54:33,000
Larri, look at me.

378
07:54:34,000 --> 07:54:52,000
We don't know
who's out there.

379
07:58:35,000 --> 07:58:58,000
Jess!

380
07:59:07,000 --> 07:59:20,000
Jess.

381
07:59:45,000 --> 08:00:03,000
Jess.

382
08:00:03,000 --> 08:00:22,000
- Jess.
- Jess.

383
08:03:08,000 --> 08:03:28,000
Where's Jess?

384
08:05:06,000 --> 08:05:25,000
What happened?

385
08:05:43,000 --> 08:06:07,000
Gone.

386
08:06:45,000 --> 08:07:03,000
Shush.
Shush.

387
08:07:04,000 --> 08:07:27,000
It's okay.

388
08:07:27,000 --> 08:07:46,000
Shh.

389
08:07:46,000 --> 08:08:19,000
- Gone.
- Shh.

390
08:08:38,000 --> 08:09:13,000
It's gonna kill us.
It's gonna kill us.

391
08:09:26,000 --> 08:09:44,000
It's gonna kill us.

392
08:10:01,000 --> 08:10:23,000
It's gonna kill us.

393
08:10:23,000 --> 08:11:00,000
It's gonna kill us.
It's gonna kill us.

394
08:12:00,000 --> 08:12:22,000
Let me go.
Let me go.

395
08:12:42,000 --> 08:13:01,000
It's gonna kill us.

396
08:17:11,000 --> 08:17:29,000
What are we gonna do?

397
08:17:30,000 --> 08:17:48,000
We're gonna do
what you said...

398
08:17:49,000 --> 08:18:10,000
...keep walking
till we hit a road.

399
08:18:27,000 --> 08:18:58,000
It will be dark soon.

400
08:18:59,000 --> 08:19:24,000
Then we'll walk
through the dark.

401
08:32:56,000 --> 08:33:15,000
What is it?

402
08:33:44,000 --> 08:34:01,000
Nothing.
Come on.

403
08:40:32,000 --> 08:40:56,000
Go back the other way.

404
08:47:56,000 --> 08:48:13,000
Keep moving.

405
08:50:03,000 --> 08:50:23,000
Run.

406
09:04:37,000 --> 09:04:55,000
Please.

407
09:09:31,000 --> 09:09:55,000
Larri, Larri, it's me.
It's me.

408
09:09:55,000 --> 09:10:14,000
Come on,
I've found something.

409
09:11:15,000 --> 09:11:32,000
This way.

410
09:14:08,000 --> 09:14:20,000
Get up.

411
09:15:04,000 --> 09:15:17,000
Come on.

412
09:18:26,000 --> 09:18:50,000
See if you can find something
to barricade the door.

413
09:23:28,000 --> 09:24:13,000
- That should hold her.
- Is that really necessary?

414
09:24:13,000 --> 09:24:29,000
What?

415
09:24:29,000 --> 09:24:56,000
She hasn't done anything wrong.
Why don't we just untie her?

416
09:24:57,000 --> 09:25:18,000
No, until we get
out of the woods...

417
09:25:19,000 --> 09:25:46,000
...she stays tied.

418
09:29:11,000 --> 09:29:29,000
You remember
when you came...

419
09:29:30,000 --> 09:29:55,000
...to stay with my family
that summer?

420
09:29:56,000 --> 09:30:21,000
Of course.

421
09:30:22,000 --> 09:30:50,000
Mom was in hospital
and Dad was away.

422
09:30:50,000 --> 09:31:13,000
It was my
favorite summer...

423
09:31:13,000 --> 09:31:36,000
...like having
a big sister.

424
09:32:03,000 --> 09:32:27,000
You even used to
look after me back then.

425
09:32:27,000 --> 09:32:48,000
Remember when I was being
picked on?

426
09:32:48,000 --> 09:33:08,000
You sorted them out.

427
09:33:08,000 --> 09:33:27,000
I couldn't let them
bully you.

428
09:33:27,000 --> 09:33:50,000
They were twice your size.

429
09:34:26,000 --> 09:34:44,000
And now here we are.

430
09:34:45,000 --> 09:35:04,000
You've still got
to protect me...

431
09:35:05,000 --> 09:35:48,000
...still looking
after me.

432
09:35:49,000 --> 09:36:07,000
We've got to look out
for each other.

433
09:36:08,000 --> 09:36:36,000
If we stick together,
we'll get out of this.

434
09:37:26,000 --> 09:37:45,000
You know something?

435
09:37:46,000 --> 09:38:04,000
What?

436
09:38:05,000 --> 09:38:34,000
I never did like the woods.

437
09:39:57,000 --> 09:40:20,000
What are we gonna do
in the morning?

438
09:40:21,000 --> 09:40:41,000
Let's just try
and get some rest.

439
09:42:15,000 --> 09:42:33,000
Don't think I can sleep.

440
09:42:34,000 --> 09:42:56,000
Try.

441
09:42:56,000 --> 09:43:15,000
I'll be here.

442
09:43:16,000 --> 09:43:37,000
I'll watch over you.

443
09:44:03,000 --> 09:44:19,000
Good night, Larri.

444
09:44:44,000 --> 09:45:08,000
You're already dead.

445
09:56:30,000 --> 09:56:47,000
Milk.

446
09:56:47,000 --> 09:57:01,000
Milk, wake up.

447
09:57:02,000 --> 09:57:26,000
Come on, we've got to go.

448
09:57:44,000 --> 09:58:03,000
Where's Ketsy?

449
09:58:03,000 --> 09:58:30,000
It's just us now.

450
09:58:40,000 --> 09:58:59,000
How did she get out?

451
09:58:59,000 --> 09:59:18,000
We can't think
about that.

452
09:59:18,000 --> 09:59:45,000
Where are we gonna go?

453
10:00:08,000 --> 10:00:34,000
Out of these woods.

454
10:05:18,000 --> 10:05:36,000
- No path.
- No nothing.

455
10:05:37,000 --> 10:05:55,000
Who would build
a hut in the woods...

456
10:05:56,000 --> 10:06:14,000
...with no path
to get here?

457
10:06:15,000 --> 10:06:33,000
I think we came
that way.

458
10:06:34,000 --> 10:06:52,000
So we'll head
this way.

459
10:06:53,000 --> 10:07:15,000
- Are you sure?
- Not really.

460
10:07:15,000 --> 10:07:38,000
But we can't just
stand around here.

461
10:19:40,000 --> 10:20:00,000
I can't keep going.

462
10:21:04,000 --> 10:21:28,000
I'm so tired.

463
10:22:09,000 --> 10:22:31,000
Can't we just stop
for a bit?

464
10:22:32,000 --> 10:22:57,000
Do you want to spend
another night out here?

465
10:22:58,000 --> 10:23:17,000
No.

466
10:24:13,000 --> 10:24:32,000
What?

467
10:25:10,000 --> 10:25:41,000
Do you think Jess is
still out there somewhere?

468
10:26:44,000 --> 10:26:57,000
Come on.

469
10:29:26,000 --> 10:29:49,000
- What is it?
- Bacon.

470
10:30:11,000 --> 10:30:30,000
- What?
- I can smell bacon.

471
10:30:30,000 --> 10:30:55,000
Milk, it's in your head.

472
10:30:56,000 --> 10:31:10,000
No, I can smell it.

473
10:31:11,000 --> 10:31:33,000
Milk, we should be careful.

474
10:31:34,000 --> 10:31:56,000
It's other people.
They can get us out.

475
10:31:57,000 --> 10:32:16,000
Come on.

476
10:33:51,000 --> 10:34:10,000
Larri.

477
10:34:46,000 --> 10:35:10,000
Larri.

478
10:36:18,000 --> 10:36:38,000
Larri.

479
10:37:50,000 --> 10:38:15,000
Larri, please!
Larri!

480
10:38:15,000 --> 10:38:38,000
Please, Larri!
Please please!

481
10:38:38,000 --> 10:39:01,000
Larri! Larri! Larri!

482
10:50:10,000 --> 10:50:31,000
- Milk.
- Jess.

483
10:50:51,000 --> 10:51:02,000
Where were you?

484
10:51:03,000 --> 10:51:39,000
Me?
You disappeared.

485
10:51:40,000 --> 10:52:06,000
I was lost.

486
10:52:27,000 --> 10:52:55,000
No, you disappeared.

487
10:52:55,000 --> 10:53:23,000
What are you talking about?

488
10:53:24,000 --> 10:53:48,000
I was lost...

489
10:53:48,000 --> 10:54:15,000
...so I made my way
back to camp.

490
10:54:16,000 --> 10:54:48,000
I knew I'd find you
eventually.

491
10:55:02,000 --> 10:55:21,000
I knew you'd find me.

492
10:55:21,000 --> 10:55:41,000
I don't understand.

493
10:55:41,000 --> 10:56:02,000
What's to understand?

494
10:56:03,000 --> 10:56:27,000
You're here now.

495
11:10:04,000 --> 11:10:24,000
Larri!

496
11:13:02,000 --> 11:13:23,000
There you go...
...for you, Princess.

497
11:19:34,000 --> 11:19:53,000
Where have you been?

498
11:19:53,000 --> 11:20:12,000
Looking for you.

499
11:20:30,000 --> 11:21:10,000
I thought
I'd lost you forever.

500
11:21:10,000 --> 11:21:31,000
Well, I'm here now.

501
11:21:32,000 --> 11:21:49,000
You're okay.

502
11:21:49,000 --> 11:22:05,000
We can be together.

503
11:22:06,000 --> 11:22:33,000
What's going on?

504
11:22:33,000 --> 11:22:56,000
What do you mean?

505
11:22:57,000 --> 11:23:15,000
Where have you been?

506
11:23:16,000 --> 11:23:34,000
Where is everybody else?

507
11:23:35,000 --> 11:23:58,000
Forget all that.

508
11:26:37,000 --> 11:26:54,000
Who are you?

509
11:26:55,000 --> 11:27:28,000
Larry, you're being insane.
It's me... Webb.

510
11:27:45,000 --> 11:28:03,000
Stay away from me.

511
11:28:04,000 --> 11:28:23,000
But I love you.

512
11:29:42,000 --> 11:30:01,000
You want to go?

513
11:30:12,000 --> 11:30:28,000
You want...

514
11:30:29,000 --> 11:30:51,000
...to escape?

515
11:31:10,000 --> 11:31:38,000
One, two...

516
11:31:39,000 --> 11:32:14,000
...three...

517
11:32:15,000 --> 11:32:33,000
...four...

518
11:32:34,000 --> 11:33:04,000
...five...

519
11:33:04,000 --> 11:33:32,000
...six...

520
11:33:32,000 --> 11:33:57,000
...seven...

521
11:33:58,000 --> 11:34:23,000
...eight...

522
11:34:24,000 --> 11:34:45,000
...nine...

523
11:34:46,000 --> 11:35:04,000
...10.

524
11:51:47,000 --> 11:52:05,000
Can you hear me?

525
11:52:23,000 --> 11:52:59,000
Hello.

526
11:52:59,000 --> 11:53:22,000
Are you all right?

527
11:53:46,000 --> 11:54:04,000
You ran straight out
in front of the car.

528
11:54:05,000 --> 11:54:31,000
I could have killed you.

529
11:55:25,000 --> 11:55:52,000
Are you all right?

530
11:55:53,000 --> 11:56:17,000
I think you should
sit down.

531
11:56:41,000 --> 11:57:17,000
Why don't you sit
in the car?

532
11:57:17,000 --> 11:57:40,000
I don't think
you should move.

533
11:57:41,000 --> 11:58:04,000
Are you out here
on your own?

534
11:58:30,000 --> 11:59:00,000
Is there anyone
with you?

535
11:59:19,000 --> 11:59:41,000
Is this yours?

536
11:59:42,000 --> 12:00:01,000
Hello?

537
12:42:32,000 --> 12:42:55,000
What do you think
you're doing?

538
12:42:55,000 --> 12:43:30,000
I'm gonna burn
your forest down.

539
12:43:30,000 --> 12:43:54,000
You can't.

540
12:43:55,000 --> 12:44:19,000
Give me one good
fucking reason.

541
12:46:27,000 --> 12:46:46,000
Don't do it, Larri.

542
12:46:47,000 --> 12:47:16,000
You'll kill us all.

543
12:47:37,000 --> 12:48:05,000
Please, Larri.
We're still here.

544
12:48:05,000 --> 12:48:28,000
Don't burn us.

545
12:48:28,000 --> 12:48:53,000
Please, Larri,
don't do it.

546
12:49:22,000 --> 12:49:46,000
You can be with us.

547
12:49:47,000 --> 12:50:10,000
We're all here.

548
12:50:11,000 --> 12:50:29,000
I want to be with you...

549
12:50:30,000 --> 12:50:51,000
...forever.

550
12:53:28,000 --> 12:53:51,000
You can be with them.

551
12:54:18,000 --> 12:54:44,000
I will be.
