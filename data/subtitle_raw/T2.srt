1
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,830
So you're stuck here.

2
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,800
You're lost.

3
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,270
I'm fed up with you.

4
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:11,830
Clare,

5
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,520
I'm sorry that 
I'm straining you so much.

6
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,090
Sister Elma invited us 
to go to Chiang Mai tomorrow.

7
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,700
We have already booked tickets to the USA...

8
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,170
On the same date as her.

9
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,690
Hey, wait,

10
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,010
You talked with a gynecologist ...

11
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,010
Which I advised you?

12
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,040
Yes mom.

13
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,430
What did he say?

14
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,010
Nothing.

15
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,550
You called a man from Angeles ...

16
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,780
Who deals with the adoption of Metis?

17
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,370
They called back.

18
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,420
And what did they say?

19
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:39,650
I'm not ready for adoption.

20
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,820
I do not understand you.

21
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,960
You help so many orphans ...

22
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,660
And she is not ready yet to adopt?

23
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,620
Because I want to help many orphans, not just one.

24
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,900
You know? Sister Elma is a very good healer.

25
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,740
I'll take you to her.

26
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,900
She can help you with infertility.

27
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,770
Mom, do not.

28
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,570
Tell your husband to stop by.

29
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,110
We will arrange a prayer service.

30
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,440
Maybe when you come back.

31
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,610
Here are your tickets and guide.

32
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Here. "

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,250
You will fly Asia Pacific.

34
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,660
The flight leaves at 4.30 ...

35
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,820
Then you change to Chiang Mai, a flight at one o'clock in the afternoon.

36
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,500
Back to fly on Friday. So?

37
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,430
Thank you, Claire. You're a miracle.

38
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,930
We go.

39
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,560
When?

40
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:26,270
Right now.

41
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:27,130
All right, we'll wait for you.

42
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,990
Okay.

43
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,600
Bye Bye.

44
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,530
Okay bye.

45
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,120
You just need to check the balance of the book.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,990
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,120
By the way, we need to go to the office.
48th
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:53,060
Mila called, I need to sign a check.

48
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,890
Then we can go to the consultant.

49
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,430
There is a problem?

50
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,100
Claire, I do not want to go to counseling anymore.

51
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,080
All the same from them there is no sense, nothing has changed.

52
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,020
Jeremiah,

53
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,980
You know, we need it ...

54
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,250
"I want to stop our relations in court."

55
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,690
Do you want a divorce?

56
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:34,160
It's only official, Claire.

57
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,800
Do you want a divorce?

58
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,400
Why not say it directly?

59
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,610
I know that you are unhappy with me.

60
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,740
I'm sorry.

61
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,150
You took the orphan from your wife. 
I do not have a family.

62
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,110
I can not even give birth to a child.

63
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,050
I know that you do not 
want a sad lonely old age.

64
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,920
Tell me this straight to your face ...

65
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,960
If you put a cross on us, 
so that I have no hope left.

66
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,590
Claire, I do not understand 
why you are against adoption.

67
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,800
"You do not even want to talk about it."
- Okay. Good.

68
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,860
This is progress.

69
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:18,900
"You do not need to wait for me."
- Claire.

70
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,310
I'm really sorry. 
But this is actually the end.

71
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,740
I am your wife.

72
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:27,350
You do not even have enough 
time to wait for my return home.

73
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:31,190
You really have to tell me this, 
here in the car.

74
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,370
They have already taken Allan ...

75
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,860
To his grandfather in Cagayan De Oro.

76
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,370
Lalay and Tonting go to Bacolod, okay?

77
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,340
Lalina still does not have a ticket.

78
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,020
Does Elias really have such a big budget?

79
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,020
Five thousand only for gasoline?

80
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,350
Claire, gasoline prices have again risen.

81
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
Whom does he take with him?

82
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,360
That guy, Makoya.

83
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,660
From Paillatas.

84
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,130
Sandra and Elias will leave later today ...

85
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,250
To take him to Samar.

86
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:08,590
Wait, Sandra has not come yet.

87
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,090
She's still in Baguio.

88
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,930
Today she will not do it, 
because she fell ill.

89
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:12,730
What did she have?

90
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,030
Heck.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,970
You make me wait two days already.

92
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,810
I can not go on Sunday, 
I need to go home to Pampanga.

93
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,040
My wife already complains.

94
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,970
It can cut ...

95
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,110
Me the content.

96
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,140
Hey, Elias, you can not smoke here.

97
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,810
Janice, can you go to Samar?

98
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,910
His papers are in order.

99
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,790
You just need to take the guy, 
nothing more.

100
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,630
Oh no.

101
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,090
- We plan to take the children out ...
"Here you are, Mila.

102
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,360
This week.

103
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,790
It's June-June's birthday.

104
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,230
Now it's just Wednesday.

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,860
You can return on Friday 
if you go right away.

106
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,200
Can not we wait for Sandra's return?

107
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,940
What if she has not been 
discharged from the hospital yet?

108
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,870
And Elias will have 
to go home for the weekend.

109
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,980
Janice, we must return as soon as possible.

110
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,580
I do not want to go on the 
highway Kvirino at such an early time.

111
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,480
It is not safe.

112
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,160
Good afternoon, madam.

113
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,050
Where is the master?

114
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:13,860
He's behind.

115
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,420
Something is looking in the fridge.

116
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,180
I feel good with Sofitel.

117
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:31,800
Yes.

118
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,080
Separate room.

119
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,080
Yes.

120
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,710
Yes, there will be no one with me.

121
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,040
Stop asking questions.

122
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,400
What are you doing?

123
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:52,530
Claire, let's go.

124
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,400
I'll stay at home with 
my mother for the time being.

125
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,570
Claire, look at things realistically.

126
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,510
We have not ...

127
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,470
Do not be a prude!

128
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,960
I'm not blind.

129
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,740
What do you think about me?

130
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,140
These documents from your lawyer ...

131
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,280
Our property, our bills.

132
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,050
This is not an official divorce.

133
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:10,750
Clare.

134
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,580
Do not make me stupid.

135
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,820
Claire, it's not. I just wanted to ...

136
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,160
I will not steal your things and money.

137
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,490
You did not understand. 
I did not think about it.

138
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:19,980
You made me believe.

139
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,030
You waited for a consultation.

140
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,500
Claire, please.

141
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,330
I thought you wanted to save our marriage.

142
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:23,730
Clare.

143
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,600
I thought you were preparing our future.

144
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,030
Claire, please?

145
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,700
Claire, please, wait.

146
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,490
Claire, please.

147
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,370
Claire, let's talk about this.

148
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,140
Go.

149
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:39,400
Where, madame?

150
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,910
Give me a minute.

151
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,850
Hello, Marie.

152
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:50,750
Heck.

153
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,390
Your things are heavier 
than the child's luggage.

154
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,860
Leave, please, my things.

155
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,590
There's more here.

156
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,660
Here, all your stuff.

157
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:04,870
Heck.

158
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,400
What's in the bag? Your son?

159
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,470
You're still not used to it?

160
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,540
You know that I need to bring everything.

161
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,570
What happened?

162
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,680
Claire, did you forget something?

163
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,350
They are all gone.

164
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,310
Put your things.

165
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,660
I will take the child to Samar.

166
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:23,580
Why?

167
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,990
I'll just go crazy from the hotel walls.

168
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,090
- In the sense of a hotel?
- Hotel.

169
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,200
So who will take the child?

170
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,030
You or me?

171
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,930
What?

172
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,840
What a good suggestion.

173
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,460
I like it.

174
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,740
It's good that you came, 
I can look after my son.

175
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:50,810
Jeremy is calling

176
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,150
Jeremy is calling

177
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:57,930
Jeremy is calling

178
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,620
Your mobile phone is ringing.

179
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,020
I'm not deaf.

180
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,430
Are you okay there?

181
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,790
Just drive.

182
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,470
You already can think of suicide.

183
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,410
Yes, what's the matter?

184
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,370
You're too annoying.

185
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,720
Sorry ...

186
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,760
If I'm irritable.

187
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,900
Have you traveled 
to other provinces before?

188
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,630
Not yet.

189
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,670
Oh wait.

190
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,200
Have you heard of the Mayon volcano?

191
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,140
Does it ever erupt?

192
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:55,140
Erupt when heated.

193
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,380
Lava is flowing.

194
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,980
Do you know that 
they take melamine for plastic?

195
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:24,560
1 missed call, 3 new messages

196
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,300
Do you want to take a picture?

197
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,020
Of course.

198
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,190
Smile.

199
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,200
Good.

200
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,710
Is this your job?

201
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,480
I am a volunteer...

202
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:40,500
Because I want to help.

203
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,750
A real work?

204
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,750
Guess.

205
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,020
I saw you in uniform.

206
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,280
Do you work in a store?

207
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,720
I am the manager of a travel agency.

208
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,860
What is it?

209
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,260
If you want to travel ...

210
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,170
You'll buy a ticket from me ...

211
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,660
And I'll take care of everything.

212
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,000
You do not have to worry.

213
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,440
You will only need to board the plane.

214
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:06,400
Aircraft?

215
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,840
I did not know that you were so cool.

216
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,240
Why are you doing this?

217
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,270
Because I want to be sure ...

218
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,980
That orphans like 
you will find good families.

219
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,520
I'm happy about that.

220
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,080
A.

221
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:23,180
Look, I put instead of wallpaper.

222
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,450
Is not it nice?

223
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,090
Can I return to Manila?

224
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,200
Unknown.

225
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,880
Sir, you need to sign here.

226
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,950
Here?

227
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:16,280
Makoy, we have arrived. 
Now we will go.

228
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,540
Do not forget to say thank you.

229
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,250
Poppy, look.

230
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,790
They seem to be good people.

231
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,330
And the house looks good.

232
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:33,990
Big.

233
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,120
I think it's sad.

234
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,460
Too quiet.

235
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,800
I think I do not want to live here.

236
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,130
You'll get used to it.

237
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,900
The important thing is that 
you now have your own family ...

238
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,870
And you will not be alone any more.

239
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,620
Thank you, Miss Claire.

240
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,060
Hello, Mila.

241
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,700
Her cell phone is always off.

242
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:12,490
It seems that 
she quarreled with her husband.

243
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:13,890
She will start to swear again.

244
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,800
Yes, we will go to Allen through Bicol.

245
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,940
We'll spend the night in Sorsogon.

246
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,920
Jeremy is calling

247
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,390
Jeremy is calling

248
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,770
Are you okay?

249
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:28,440
Jeremy is calling

250
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,210
Jeremy is calling

251
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,440
Problems with her husband?

252
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,580
Jeremy is calling

253
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,620
Hey, Elias,

254
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,250
I never climbed into 
your problems with my wife.

255
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,550
I do not bring my problems to work.

256
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,860
I'm not crying. 
I do not sit quietly. I'm not sulking.

257
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:53,730
If you do not want to talk about your problems 
- do not show them.

258
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,630
I'm sorry I broke up.

259
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,230
I'm not one to smile 
when I'm ready to explode.

260
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:02,910
You know what, Claire,

261
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,810
Maybe I'm an asshole ...

262
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,810
But I'm still worried 
about those with whom I work.

263
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,890
Jeremy left me.

264
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,670
Really?

265
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,210
We have already waited 
for the marriage counselor.

266
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,700
I thought he wanted to save our marriage.

267
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:43,540
Then I learned that 
he was talking to a lawyer ...

268
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,250
On the division 
of property and accounts.

269
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,180
I feel like a fool.

270
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,860
It's just between us.

271
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,930
In the end, we are both from the shelter.

272
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,400
If you're going to 
show yourself to your husband ...

273
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:08,300
Show yourself this.

274
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,500
Never let him see his weakness.

275
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,110
You already know this.

276
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,650
If only you do not have feelings left.

277
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,050
But I think,

278
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,590
He just wants to make a scene ...

279
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:22,750
To question your relationship ...

280
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:28,120
And take away from you 
what you are ready to fight for.

281
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,310
Nonsense!

282
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,580
Where is he from?

283
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,950
There's nothing I can do.

284
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,260
So are you going back to Manila tomorrow?

285
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,100
Yes. My wife already 
tried to commit suicide ...

286
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,720
And I'm afraid it can cut ...

287
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,500
My allowance.

288
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,210
Angela's things are collected.

289
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,240
I'll introduce you later, Claire.

290
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,480
With whom?

291
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,770
You did not talk to Sandra?

292
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,320
Oh no.

293
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,950
I only know that she is 
in Bakuo and is ill with something.

294
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,960
I thought you called me here ...

295
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,160
due to...

296
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,360
Well, I spoke with Sandra on Sunday.

297
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,070
She took her child to Nauja ...

298
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,930
But said that she would return here.

299
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,530
You are doing a good deed.

300
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:47,170
The road was blocked ...

301
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,610
So Claire decided to stay the night.

302
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,940
Sister, what is your business with Sandra?

303
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,180
We decided to take an orphan.

304
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,650
We found a relative in Manila.

305
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,980
Her aunt is on the verge of ...

306
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,720
And wants us to take 
Angela as soon as possible.

307
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,790
How old is Angelie?

308
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,660
In two days there will be 9 ...

309
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:13,800
Second of November.

310
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,830
Angeli ...

311
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,400
This is Miss Claire.

312
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,070
She will go with you 
to Manila and talk to your aunt.

313
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,270
Hello, Angela.

314
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,740
Do not be shy.

315
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,440
Miss Claire is kind.

316
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,180
She has already helped many children.

317
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,990
Angelie.

318
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,360
Angelie.

319
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,830
She was always like this ...

320
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,970
Even when it first appeared here.

321
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,370
She peers ...

322
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,570
Although she has excellent eyesight.

323
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:58,140
Are your things ready?

324
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,600
Tomorrow you will go 
with Miss Claire to Manila.

325
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,190
Jeremy is calling

326
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,380
Jeremy is calling

327
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:09,650
Clare!

328
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:10,910
What?

329
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,960
I'm bored.

330
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,980
I'm going for a walk.

331
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,260
Where are you going?

332
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,390
I'll drink a little at the bar.

333
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:21,560
Do not drink much.

334
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,270
We leave early in the morning.

335
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:25,470
I do not for a long time.

336
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,510
I'll be back soon.

337
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,060
I'm just bored.

338
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,600
Battery low

339
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,040
Jeremy is calling

340
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,640
Jeremy is calling

341
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,780
Jeremy is calling

342
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,050
Jeremy is calling

343
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,970
Janice did not 
mean anything like that.

344
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,610
We are at work.

345
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,080
Well, you know, 
her pipe is always off.

346
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,920
Wait.

347
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,380
Clare.

348
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,230
Clare.

349
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,060
What?

350
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,560
Mila is calling.

351
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,100
Tell her I'm already asleep.

352
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,190
I'll call her back tomorrow.

353
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,530
She is already sleeping. 
She'll call you back tomorrow.

354
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,110
I'm also going to.
I leave tomorrow morning.

355
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,640
Pssst ...

356
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,230
10 missed calls. 
20 new messages.

357
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,540
What are you doing here?

358
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,980
I saw a man enter the room.

359
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,180
What?

360
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,540
Sister...

361
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,510
What?

362
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,920
You are pissed.

363
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,780
O ...

364
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,960
Old age is not joy.

365
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,930
Pssst ...

366
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,380
Angela?

367
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,360
Angeli ...

368
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,130
You had a nightmare.

369
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,000
Angelie.

370
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:56,670
Angelie!

371
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,300
Stop it.

372
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,010
It was just a dream.

373
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,080
It's not really.

374
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,820
Jeremy came.

375
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,860
I did not know that you were leaving.

376
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,020
Janice did not tell me.

377
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,520
Mila, can we not 
talk about this while I'm here?

378
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,470
Okay.

379
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,090
Till.

380
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,910
Baby, I got frost from your skin.

381
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,500
Sister...

382
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,650
You did not notice 
anything strange in Angela?

383
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,940
For example?

384
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:46,150
I can not explain.

385
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:46,640
But...

386
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,450
At night she had a nightmare.

387
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,380
Her father died in an accident.

388
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,830
She was there when it happened ...

389
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,090
But she survived.

390
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:00,500
I'm sure it hurt her.

391
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,810
Jeremy is calling

392
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:24,450
Judging by the records, 
you and your father traveled a lot.

393
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:26,060
First you lived in Bacold.

394
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,320
Then in Sagayan de Oro.

395
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,350
Then in Aklan.
397.
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,130
Then even in Samara.

396
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,260
How did your father go blind?

397
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,980
I, too, lost my parents as a child.

398
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,280
It's true.

399
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,550
I was five years old.

400
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:03,490
Mom and Dad went to Cebu.

401
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,820
They sailed on the ship ...

402
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,860
When the storm began.

403
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:14,300
Then no one survived.

404
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,500
Then I saw them for the last time.

405
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:25,480
I remember them 
every time I look at the sea.

406
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,820
I pray for them.

407
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,830
Be careful, my dear.

408
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,030
Dad...

409
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,930
Look at this sink.

410
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:45,570
Do not touch.

411
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:46,540
Can bite.

412
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,940
Something moves inside.

413
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,210
Dad, look.

414
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,940
You can not take it from me, Gary.

415
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
Expensive!

416
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,130
Expensive!

417
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,360
Angelie!

418
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,680
Shall we sit here?

419
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,620
I'll rest first.

420
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,160
Are you cold?

421
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,170
Do you have a jacket in your bag?

422
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,710
Beautiful.

423
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,350
Did your father give you?

424
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,650
I'm sure you miss him.

425
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,250
But...

426
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,880
He said he would never leave me.

427
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,660
Surely he's looking out for you.

428
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:21,730
How do you know?

429
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,170
When I was a child...

430
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,070
I always felt ...

431
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:30,640
That my parents are 
watching me and guarding me.

432
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,570
Do you want 
to look at their photos?

433
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,750
Look.

434
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:42,920
You were plump 
when you were a child.

435
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,290
Oh yeah.

436
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,970
Are they your parents?

437
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:53,830
Yes.

438
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:58,660
Now I know who you are so beautiful.

439
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,370
Your mother is very beautiful.

440
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,670
Jeremy is calling

441
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,040
I do not remember her at all.

442
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,770
Jeremy is calling

443
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,440
Jeremy is calling

444
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:10,570
Why do not you answer?

445
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,850
Jeremy is calling

446
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,950
- Jeremy calls
"Hey, Elias."

447
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,450
- Elias.
- What?

448
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:21,220
- Jeremy calls
"Please, look after the child."

449
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
Hello, Jeremy.

450
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,170
Claire, it's good 
that you picked up the phone.

451
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,260
Why are you calling?

452
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,270
Where are you?

453
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,670
I'm worrying about you.

454
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,440
Really?

455
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:40,650
Why?

456
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:43,170
Can not the papers wait for my signature?

457
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:46,280
"Do you need this urgently?"
"Claire, please listen to me."

458
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:48,550
The fact that I want to get a divorce ...

459
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,050
Does not mean I'm not worried about you.

460
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,590
Please, stop calling me.

461
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,800
You wanted freedom, right?

462
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,770
Leave me alone?

463
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:01,690
Clare...

464
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,640
I've been feeling weird since you left.

465
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,400
Can we talk about this?

466
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,840
I do not have time to listen to you.

467
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:33,820
Angelie!

468
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,090
Angelie!

469
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,130
Angelie!

470
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,800
Angelie!

471
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:41,440
Hard to open.

472
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:47,710
Elias.

473
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:48,780
Elias.

474
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,820
Elias, wake up.
477.
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,480
ABOUT.

475
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,410
Where is Angela?

476
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:54,120
I thought she was with you.

477
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,550
I asked you to look after her.

478
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,590
Where could she go?

479
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
She's here somewhere.

480
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,060
Come on, get up.

481
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:04,630
It is necessary to find 
someone who will help her find it.

482
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,830
Something bad could happen to her.

483
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:07,300
Fast.

484
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,370
Pssst ...

485
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,480
Angela?

486
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,640
Have you found a child?

487
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,470
What?

488
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:23,790
Angela?

489
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,810
Angelie.

490
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,740
Angelie.

491
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,140
Angelie.

492
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:36,750
It's me.

493
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,510
Aunt Claire.

494
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,670
Where have you been?

495
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:39,880
What happened to you?

496
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,710
Where did you get this?

497
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,550
Who gave you this?

498
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,830
Angel, are you done?

499
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,100
Yes, madam. I am full.

500
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,680
Angeli ...

501
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,970
I want to ask you ...

502
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,250
About what happened on the ferry.

503
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,550
I saw how you talked to the woman.

504
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,750
Did she give you candy?

505
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,660
I do not remember any woman.

506
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,720
But I know...

507
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,190
That I was asleep.

508
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:32,740
I ran after butterflies.

509
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,470
I knew...

510
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,170
That I sleep.

511
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,180
When you woke me ...

512
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,410
I already had a candy.

513
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,510
Next...

514
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:48,050
If you do not know someone ...

515
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,450
Do not talk to him or go with him.

516
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,400
Dad taught me to 
look people in the eye ...

517
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,230
To find out whether 
they are good or bad.

518
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,800
How do you know who 
is bad and who is good?

519
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,640
Dad said ...

520
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,840
If the reflection 
in the eyes is reversed ...

521
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:17,910
Then the person is bad.

522
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,890
Heck!

523
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,080
What? What happened?

524
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,360
Nothing.

525
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:10,520
Hey!

526
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,230
Are these pigs?

527
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,400
Where did they come from?

528
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,140
A lot of pigs.

529
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:21,710
Where did they come from?

530
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,570
What is it?

531
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:30,760
What happened?

532
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,380
Brother!

533
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:48,540
What are you doing?

534
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,010
Nothing.

535
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,030
Nothing.

536
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,310
Are you okay?

537
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:54,280
I'm fine.

538
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:54,710
Nothing to worry about.

539
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,440
What happened to you?

540
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:57,220
Nothing.

541
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,710
Forget.

542
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,920
What happened to you last night?

543
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,220
I came to the bar, 
and you were not there.

544
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,560
I had to drink alone.

545
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:13,400
What?

546
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,570
I did not go out last night.

547
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,600
And you?

548
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,000
Went out. I followed you.

549
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,200
I knocked at you at night ...

550
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,670
Because Mila wanted to talk to you ...

551
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,730
But you said that 
you already went to bed.

552
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,340
Claire, are you okay?

553
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,970
I do not know what 
you're talking about.

554
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,080
You're talking nonsense.

555
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,580
I'm sure you're doing this 
to keep me from falling asleep.

556
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:42,920
How slowly can this truck go?

557
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,560
Elias, be careful!

558
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,360
Was it the same car as last night?

559
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,500
How did it happen?

560
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,240
Heck.

561
00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:05,580
Hey, help me.

562
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,180
Here! Faster!

563
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,030
Where did the black car go?

564
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,930
We almost collided.

565
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:31,240
Let's check below, 
they may still be alive.

566
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,040
We need to quickly, 
until it exploded.

567
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,050
He is still stirring.

568
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,950
Let's carry him upstairs.

569
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:39,980
Slow.

570
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:44,820
Faster.

571
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:48,020
Hey!

572
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,430
What is it?

573
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,120
What are you doing there?

574
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,360
Who you are?

575
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,430
What you need?

576
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,390
Why?

577
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,230
What you need?

578
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,410
Angeli ...

579
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,950
You noticed ...

580
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,020
What happens to us 
a lot of strange things?

581
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:27,830
Like that woman on the ferry.

582
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,570
Why did your dad always tell you 
to stay away from bad people?

583
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:39,600
In what sense - bad?

584
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,940
This can be important.

585
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:02,970
Hello, Mom?

586
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,900
Claire, where are you?

587
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:06,640
Jeremy came in ...

588
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:08,470
And spoke to me and your father.

589
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,150
I'm in the village, Mom.

590
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,880
I had to take the child.

591
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,370
And I'm on my way back.

592
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,320
Wait, my father wants to talk to you.

593
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,010
Mom, do not ...

594
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,780
Hello, Claire?

595
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,280
Where are you?

596
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:28,180
Dad.

597
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,850
We talked to Jeremy.

598
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,090
He told us what happened.

599
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,430
He's worried about you.

600
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,730
He shocked me, Dad.
604.
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:43,410
I know what you feel.

601
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,140
Please just go back home.

602
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,470
Let's talk about it.

603
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:50,240
Dad, do not worry about me. 
With me, in fact, everything is fine.

604
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,150
I'll just finish it ...

605
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,780
And will return home.

606
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:55,550
Then, it's OK.

607
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:56,510
We love you.

608
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:57,490
Be careful.

609
00:44:57,620 --> 00:44:58,680
And I love you, Dad.

610
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,520
Miss Claire ...

611
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,370
Was it your dad?

612
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,810
The one who adopted you?

613
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,010
In fact, he is my uncle.

614
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,850
My mother's brother.

615
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:28,920
But all my life 
I treated him like my father.

616
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,380
You know?

617
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:36,090
They love me very much.

618
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:42,330
Do you think that the one who 
will adopt me will also love me?

619
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:44,830
You are very easy to love.

620
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,340
You're lucky your aunt is kind.

621
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,470
I was not so lucky.

622
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,410
Elias, do not start.

623
00:45:53,510 --> 00:45:54,040
Clare...

624
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,950
You can not tell a child ...

625
00:45:55,950 --> 00:45:57,040
That life will always be happy.

626
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:00,210
Not all children 
are lucky as you are.

627
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:02,680
I was almost killed 
by my adoptive parents.

628
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:04,390
Elias, stop it.

629
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,690
Here, you need 
to change the solenoid.

630
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,630
Here they are not for sale.

631
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:10,390
They are sold only in Manila.

632
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,120
So what are we waiting for ...

633
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:14,460
If we should be already on the bus.

634
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:16,360
I already asked around.

635
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:18,440
Buses here at this time do not go.

636
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:20,740
We can leave tomorrow.

637
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:26,130
We need your help. Faster!

638
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,410
What's going on here?

639
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,520
The man is wounded.

640
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,550
It seems that he was badly beaten.

641
00:46:30,550 --> 00:46:31,580
Is he still alive?

642
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,480
There is no pulse.

643
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,580
Take him to the hospital.

644
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:36,780
I'll be damned.

645
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:40,220
Can we get lucky?

646
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,640
I'll sleep a little bit.

647
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,240
You, too, need to rest.

648
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:13,150
I'm scared.

649
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:14,620
Why?

650
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,660
They can take me.

651
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:20,890
Who are you talking about?

652
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,940
They are everywhere.

653
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,170
But we do not see them.

654
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,240
The ones you ask me about. It's them.

655
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,640
They are here?

656
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,750
They are always here.

657
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,830
Those who are hungry can have a snack.

658
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,680
Hello, Mila. Did not wake you?

659
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,210
Nothing.

660
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:09,040
Where are you?

661
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,820
I think we are already in Quezon.

662
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,050
Why did you call?

663
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,290
I tried to call you from last night.

664
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,080
I wanted to ask you 
something about the baby.

665
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:20,850
What?

666
00:48:21,990 --> 00:48:23,830
It's not easy for me.

667
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,960
I feel that something is wrong with her.

668
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:26,460
What?

669
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:27,360
Why?

670
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:29,800
Is her character ready?

671
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,100
And what? What happened?

672
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:35,740
We are waiting for you.

673
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:37,100
Hello, Claire?

674
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,210
Claire, hello.

675
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,480
Mila, I'll call you back.
680.
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,580
Yeah, we'll talk when I get back.

676
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:49,010
- Good.
- Of course.

677
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,170
Miss Claire!

678
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,040
Miss Claire!

679
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,100
Miss Claire!

680
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:10,760
Miss Claire!

681
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,310
Miss Claire!

682
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,080
Let's catch the bus.

683
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:19,640
What's happening?

684
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:53,180
Here's the money.
690.
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,310
Here, Elias.

685
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:56,420
I will first clarify.

686
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:56,950
Of course.

687
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:02,430
Sir, can I ask you something?

688
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,590
What?

689
00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:05,190
Do you know where it is?

690
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,260
"Hey, no one will steal your bag."
- 308.

691
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,560
Third floor.

692
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,000
Climb the stairs to 
the end of the corridor.

693
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:15,870
Thank you.

694
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,940
Of course.

695
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:23,950
"Hey, Elias ..."
- What was it?

696
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,310
Let's go to the third floor.

697
00:50:35,930 --> 00:50:37,360
What is this call?

698
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:38,690
Hello, Mila.

699
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,990
We are already there. 
Just arrived.

700
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:46,070
We are looking for an apartment 
in which the child was taken.

701
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,800
Oh sure.

702
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:01,850
It's here?

703
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:04,580
We're still on the second floor.

704
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,690
Miss, do you know where is room 308?

705
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,930
This is the other side.

706
00:51:17,170 --> 00:51:17,830
Thank you.

707
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:19,290
What did you say?

708
00:51:19,570 --> 00:51:20,870
I asked, what do you have?

709
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:22,230
I did not eat.

710
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,550
That's 308.

711
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:47,390
Miss Pangitaon?

712
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,000
Miss Pangitaon?

713
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:56,100
Are you with Angelica?

714
00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:01,380
Come on. Come in.

715
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:03,840
Sit down please.

716
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,220
When will Miss Pangitaon return?

717
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:12,990
Oh, you do not know. 
She told me that she would call.

718
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:14,020
Clear.

719
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:17,860
If it suits you, 
you can leave Angela with me.

720
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,160
What? I can not leave the child.

721
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:24,800
In addition, 
Miss Pangitaon must sign the papers.

722
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:28,800
Oh, yes, she also warned about it.

723
00:52:29,370 --> 00:52:32,500
Well, Angela, now it's your house.

724
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,110
Do you want to look at your room?

725
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:39,680
I think she needs 
time to get used to it.

726
00:52:41,050 --> 00:52:43,110
I have to leave you.

727
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:47,490
I need to finish the costumes for Halloween. 
I participate in the competition.

728
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,460
If you need anything, 
I'll be in the next room.

729
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:51,460
By the way, 
did not you hear your name?

730
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,020
I'm Tess. 
Here's the key.

731
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,830
Make yourself at home. 
I'll be back soon.

732
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,170
Thank you.

733
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:00,330
Heck.

734
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,400
Strange apartment.

735
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,800
As if the otherworldly.

736
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,950
Elias, this is not your house.

737
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:13,080
I want coffee.

738
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,650
I will go...

739
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,620
And I will finish something 
important while you are here.

740
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,580
When will you be back?

741
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,220
I do not for a long time.

742
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,600
Angela, I'm leaving right now.

743
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,400
Do not hang your nose.

744
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,930
When will you come back for me?

745
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,130
I first need to go to the office, 
withdraw money.

746
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:38,970
Then I'll buy spare parts for the car. 
I can get stuck in a traffic jam.

747
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,020
Why not leave the baby with Tess?

748
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,540
We will return for papers tomorrow.

749
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,610
Leave the baby with her? 
I do not even know her.

750
00:53:47,890 --> 00:53:50,120
Sandra knows aunt.

751
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,660
Do not want to leave the child ...

752
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,690
Or just do not want 
to solve problems with Jeremy?

753
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,230
When you get back to the office ...

754
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:08,200
Tell Mile to see what 
characteristic Sandra gave to her aunt.

755
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,610
I'll tell Mila to call you.

756
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:13,170
Hey, Elias,

757
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:14,310
Come back for me, okay?
764.
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,510
Write to me, 
or call me when you go back.

758
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:17,210
Of course.

759
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,710
Are you leaving already?

760
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,650
Go there.

761
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,020
So, in short, you do not have to go around. 
And there is too long.

762
00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:30,950
This is true?

763
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:31,660
Yes.

764
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,770
I do not like it here.

765
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,650
Dad told me that 
someone wants to pick me up.

766
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:04,420
He said that they would 
try to take me until I was 9.

767
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,930
What are you talking about?

768
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:09,230
You will not understand.

769
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:16,070
Since the moment I met you at the 
orphanage and while we were traveling ...

770
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,900
Much has happened.

771
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,340
A lot of incomprehensible.

772
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:25,240
Are you afraid of Aunt Isabel?

773
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,050
Want to pogudyvat, 
what does she look like?

774
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,860
She's got a nice apartment, is not she?

775
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,100
And the kitchen is big.

776
00:55:44,070 --> 00:55:47,300
Do you think 
she is fat or thin?

777
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,600
I think it's fat.

778
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,310
But you know what?

779
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:56,040
I think your aunt 
is as beautiful as you.

780
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:58,870
You see, beauty is inherited.

781
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,650
Jeremy is calling

782
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:04,780
Jeremy is calling

783
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,120
Jeremiah?

784
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,280
Claire, I'm so sorry.

785
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:10,450
I do not know what I did to you.

786
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:11,890
Us.

787
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,530
I thought this was what I wanted.

788
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,390
But when you left, I began to worry.

789
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,730
This led me to the idea that ...

790
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,470
I so wanted a divorce ...

791
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:25,140
Because I wanted 
to know if I really love you.

792
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:27,840
And do you love me.

793
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:30,650
Now I know, Claire.

794
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:33,610
Now I know that 
I still love you so much.

795
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,780
If there is something good in this ...

796
00:56:38,190 --> 00:56:39,490
So this is what I now know.

797
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,390
I can not live without you, Claire.

798
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:46,390
Please come home.

799
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,390
I'm already in Manila.

800
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,430
I'm just waiting for someone.

801
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:52,960
Who is it?

802
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,240
I did not tell you that 
I was taking a child to my aunt.

803
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,840
I'm waiting for my aunt.

804
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:02,870
I'll call when I'm ready.

805
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:04,450
Okay.

806
00:57:04,850 --> 00:57:06,370
I'll be waiting for your call.

807
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,050
Of course.

808
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,340
Be careful.

809
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:11,050
I love you.

810
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,810
I need to go to the toilet.

811
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:29,700
What happened?

812
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,830
Is it locked?

813
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:36,780
Maybe there is a repair.

814
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,590
Angelie.

815
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,270
We'd better get out of here.

816
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:02,640
What?

817
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,840
I do not like it here.

818
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:09,910
Where are you going?

819
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,140
We go to the dining room.

820
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,150
Wait.

821
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:14,220
I'll go with you.

822
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:17,620
Please, take the money ...

823
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:20,520
- Well, there is not much here.
- No thanks. Miss Pangitaon asked me ...

824
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,250
- let you eat here.
"Now, you can eat now."

825
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,860
Delicious.

826
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:26,560
Seriously, normally.

827
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:28,520
Okay...

828
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:29,860
Thank you.

829
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,270
Eat while hot.

830
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,030
Delicious.

831
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,570
Angelie. Come on, eat it.

832
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:34,940
Domeng.

833
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:35,530
Oh, too hot.

834
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,200
You're right.

835
00:58:36,770 --> 00:58:38,330
Let's take the instruments.

836
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,680
Wait here.

837
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:47,080
The guy is already gone?

838
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:47,940
Yes.

839
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:49,980
Why is she still here?

840
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:51,680
She's waiting for Madame.

841
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:53,990
She has papers for her signature.

842
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,160
Madame must sign it herself.

843
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:57,950
I could take a guy.

844
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,630
She could give me a woman.

845
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,290
Enough.

846
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,230
We are ordered not to harm these two.

847
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,070
By 7:30 ...

848
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,050
Miss Pangitaon still has not come ...

849
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:16,780
We with the child will go.

850
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:18,020
Hello.

851
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,550
Clare.

852
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:19,350
Mrs. Villamin?

853
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:20,180
God, Claire!

854
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:20,850
Get me out of here.

855
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,980
You have no idea 
what's going on here.

856
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,150
In Thailand, 
people take to the streets.

857
00:59:25,390 --> 00:59:25,890
What?

858
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,260
They canceled all flights.

859
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:28,360
What happened?

860
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:30,420
How should I know? 
I do not speak Thai.

861
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,360
I want to fly home, 
but no flights.

862
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,520
Do something, Claire.

863
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:36,630
Mary, if only I could get there ...

864
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:37,830
I would already be there.

865
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,500
Can you at least 
decide for yourself?

866
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:40,870
I'm already trying ...

867
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,930
Just can not find a flight to Manila.

868
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:46,510
Try to take her to Singapore ...

869
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:47,710
"Or in Kuala Lumpur."
"What about bills?"

870
00:59:47,710 --> 00:59:48,540
Leave now.

871
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,050
They are going to take the child.

872
00:59:53,050 --> 00:59:55,280
Let's talk about this later.

873
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:57,180
They're really going to pick you up.

874
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:14,060
Tess.

875
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,440
What?

876
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:29,350
I'm sorry.

877
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:31,010
She must be stuck in traffic.

878
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:32,780
I'm sure she's coming here.

879
01:00:32,890 --> 01:00:34,410
If she does not arrive by 7:30 ...

880
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:35,760
We with the child will leave.

881
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,130
I already asked 
someone to give us a ride.

882
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,000
You can call the office, 
maybe she's still there.

883
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:58,810
Who are you writing to?

884
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,450
This is for you.

885
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,010
For me?

886
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,240
Let me have a look...

887
01:01:04,590 --> 01:01:05,210
I will read.

888
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,720
It is too early.

889
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,120
I'll put it in the bag 
until the right moment.

890
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,560
Not finished yet?

891
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:19,860
I think we should rest first.

892
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:24,000
So it will stay fresh 
until your aunt returns.

893
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,440
She will come at any time.

894
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:57,530
Calling Elias

895
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,090
Calling Elias

896
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:02,620
Angelie.

897
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,620
Where are you?

898
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,060
Angelie!

899
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:29,880
Angelie!

900
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,850
Jeremy is calling

901
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:00,150
Jeremy is calling

902
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,640
Hello, Jeremy.

903
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:02,650
Where are you now?

904
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:03,950
I tried to call you.

905
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,980
We're still here.

906
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,250
Can I ask you?

907
01:06:08,630 --> 01:06:10,060
Can you give us a ride?

908
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:12,120
Tess.

909
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:14,760
Tess.

910
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,650
Faster Please.

911
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:38,280
I warned you.

912
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,590
You did not want to listen.

913
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:42,050
Excuse me...

914
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,050
Miss.

915
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:45,830
"Leave now ..."
- Miss.

916
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,820
It's not too late.

917
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,300
Where is Angela?

918
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,700
I do not know anything.

919
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,300
I do not know anything.

920
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,570
You're lying.

921
01:06:58,040 --> 01:06:58,840
Where is the baby?

922
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,100
I already said, I do not know ...

923
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,480
And there's nothing you can do about it ...

924
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:04,640
Once she decided to go with them.

925
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:05,450
Hey.

926
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:07,920
Shut up fool.

927
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,510
Stop bothering guests.

928
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,490
I'm sorry, miss.

929
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:12,590
She's sick on her head.

930
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,080
Have you seen the girl who was with me?

931
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:17,560
It should be somewhere around here.

932
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,960
Maybe he plays with 
the other children below.

933
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:22,060
Going fourth.

934
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:24,860
Answer our questions.

935
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:26,430
Spirit...

936
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:29,700
The spirit that 
goes forth is the fourth.

937
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:31,900
Answer our questions.

938
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,570
Spirit...

939
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:36,650
The spirit that 
goes forth is the fourth.

940
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:38,820
Answer our questions.

941
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:40,250
Children...

942
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:41,080
A!

943
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,180
Have you seen a little 
girl in a black dress?

944
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,260
Black?

945
01:07:47,390 --> 01:07:48,220
Yes.

946
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:49,990
Are you talking about Nenita?

947
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,390
It is black, does not wear black.

948
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:54,160
It is not local.

949
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,700
We did not see her.

950
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:58,170
Maybe it was already sold.

951
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,400
There's a full madhouse around here.

952
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:01,400
Children catch and cut ...

953
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:03,640
To sell their kidneys and liver.

954
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,070
Mila is calling

955
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:07,480
Mila is calling

956
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:08,650
Hello...

957
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:09,580
Mila.

958
01:08:09,750 --> 01:08:11,080
I found the characteristic.

959
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,080
I was at the bottom of the pile ...

960
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:14,580
Baby did not want to be found.

961
01:08:15,350 --> 01:08:17,510
Sandra's characterization was negative.

962
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,360
What?

963
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,290
She suggested looking Aunt Angeli closer.

964
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:22,860
Where is Elias?

965
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,030
He should have come back.

966
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,320
He has not arrived yet?

967
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:29,730
He said he tried to get you through, 
but without success.

968
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,590
I fell asleep.

969
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,240
He had to call longer to wake me up.

970
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:37,580
I'll call him back.

971
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,060
Okay.

972
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:44,740
We'll put your backpack 
and your hair in order.
c
01:10:07,160 --> 01:10:07,790
Angelie!

973
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:21,810
Oh sure.

974
01:10:58,950 --> 01:10:59,680
Elias!

975
01:11:02,790 --> 01:11:03,340
Elias.

976
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,420
Elias, stop!
985
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:10.490
Elias!

977
11:11:12,400 --> 12:22:25,160
Elias!

978
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:23,100
Angelie!

979
01:11:24,010 --> 01:11:24,440
Angelie!

980
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:25,970
Angers ...

981
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:26,800
Angelie!

982
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:30,280
Angelie!

983
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:32,950
Angelie!

984
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,480
Miss Claire, 
please do not leave me here.

985
01:11:37,620 --> 01:11:38,860
I will not leave you.

986
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,120
Do not leave me.

987
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:40,860
You just slept.

988
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:41,690
I will not leave you.

989
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:42,850
It was just a dream.

990
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:45,530
I did not sleep, Miss Claire.

991
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:47,160
I know, it was actually.

992
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,220
It was just a dream.

993
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,930
The butterfly called me behind her.

994
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:55,640
We passed through 
the walls of the rooms ...

995
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:59,130
Until they reached a beautiful place.

996
01:11:59,510 --> 01:12:00,100
What place?

997
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:02,410
Everything there seemed expensive ...

998
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:04,810
As if the rich lived there.

999
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,380
I've never seen 
anything like this before.

1000
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:10,850
I heard a woman's voice ...

1001
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:14,020
Who said that I should go with her.

1002
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:15,680
But after...

1003
01:12:16,460 --> 01:12:17,120
Then what?

1004
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,170
I remembered that I promised my father ...

1005
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,960
That I will not go with them.

1006
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:25,500
Angelie, listen.

1007
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:26,930
It's not really.

1008
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:28,330
"It was just a dream."
- It really is.

1009
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:29,510
There is no butterfly.

1010
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:31,010
- And there is no woman.
"It was not a dream."

1011
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:32,010
You did not see a beautiful place.

1012
01:12:32,010 --> 01:12:32,670
- It really is.
-Actually...

1013
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:35,170
It's real that I'm here, with you.

1014
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:37,010
- I am real.
- It's real.

1015
01:13:02,410 --> 01:13:02,930
Stay here.

1016
01:13:21,690 --> 01:13:22,490
Clare!

1017
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,160
Elias.

1018
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:47,450
Get out of here...

1019
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:48,740
now.

1020
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:54,520
Tess.

1021
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:55,750
Tess.

1022
01:13:56,460 --> 01:13:57,430
Are you there?

1023
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:58,420
Tess.

1024
01:13:59,260 --> 01:13:59,730
Tess.

1025
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:01,730
Tess.

1026
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:02,800
Miss Claire.

1027
01:14:02,970 --> 01:14:03,430
What?

1028
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:06,000
Miss Claire, they're coming.

1029
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:07,840
We need to leave.

1030
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:08,500
Miss Claire!

1031
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:09,500
Angela, wait.

1032
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:10,110
Angelie!

1033
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:11,830
Angelie!

1034
01:14:12,580 --> 01:14:13,010
Angelie!

1035
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:16,610
Tell me, who are they?

1036
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,550
They are not like us.

1037
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:19,080
What?

1038
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:20,440
I do not understand you.

1039
01:14:21,020 --> 01:14:23,510
Tell me the truth, who are they?

1040
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,410
Incanto.

1041
01:14:30,190 --> 01:14:33,220
Do not make me repeat ...

1042
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,860
Because they will come closer.

1043
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:42,400
Let's go to! Faster!

1044
01:14:42,610 --> 01:14:43,300
Angelie!

1045
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:53,440
We have returned?

1046
01:14:55,820 --> 01:14:57,380
Why are we still here?

1047
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:28,980
Angelie.

1048
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:29,620
Angelie.

1049
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:31,110
Angelie.

1050
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:35,260
We must flee.

1051
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:24,410
There.

1052
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:57,860
Miss Claire!

1053
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:01,370
Angelie!

1054
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:03,600
Angelie!

1055
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:11,650
Angelie!

1056
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:33,710
Stupid. 
Get up. Faster.

1057
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:37,640
You did not want to believe me.

1058
01:17:45,290 --> 01:17:49,190
They left. 
We are safe.

1059
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:52,030
Faster, it's almost three o'clock.

1060
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:53,330
I need to prepare

1061
01:17:53,730 --> 01:17:54,220
For what?

1062
01:17:54,900 --> 01:17:56,760
Do you want to return Angela?

1063
01:17:56,830 --> 01:17:57,530
Yes.

1064
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:09,250
Hello, Angela.

1065
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:10,570
The time has come.

1066
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:14,020
Happy Birthday.

1067
01:18:17,350 --> 01:18:18,560
What are you doing?

1068
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,550
We must save Angelica.

1069
01:18:21,490 --> 01:18:23,250
Her mother took it.

1070
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:25,850
Her mother died a long time ago.

1071
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:27,990
Anzheli's mother can not die.

1072
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,690
Incanto immortal.

1073
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:32,970
Angeli ...

1074
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:37,340
Daughter of a mortal man and incanto.

1075
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,210
The man fell in love with ...

1076
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:44,710
Believe me, Claire.

1077
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:47,470
I myself gave birth 
to a child from one of them.

1078
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:50,810
He took my daughter.

1079
01:18:50,990 --> 01:18:52,720
I could not do anything about it.

1080
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,260
The child made a decision.

1081
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:55,790
Decision?

1082
01:18:56,430 --> 01:18:56,950
What solution?

1083
01:18:57,390 --> 01:19:01,460
When a baby incanto 
is born in the world of people ...

1084
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:06,500
They need it before 
her ninth or eighteenth birthday ...

1085
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:07,470
Convince her to 
go with them at her will.

1086
01:19:07,940 --> 01:19:10,370
They can not take a child by force.

1087
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:14,510
But they can convince her with cunning.

1088
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,710
In their world there is no true love.

1089
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,240
They have no emotions.

1090
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,410
They are callous.

1091
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:24,640
They do not have souls.

1092
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:26,520
They used you, Claire.

1093
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:38,130
I brought her here.

1094
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:40,540
Where's her bag?

1095
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,800
Heck. She did not 
have a bag when we took her.

1096
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:43,900
There is.

1097
01:19:44,470 --> 01:19:45,940
We need it.

1098
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:50,510
We need to destroy all of her 
things so as not to cause suspicion.

1099
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:51,840
It must be in the apartment.

1100
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:52,910
Call Domenga.

1101
01:19:53,050 --> 01:19:54,040
Tell him to take the things.

1102
01:19:57,890 --> 01:19:58,580
Where are the things?

1103
01:20:00,390 --> 01:20:01,420
Things? Here.

1104
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:02,890
Faster, it's almost midnight.

1105
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:06,160
Three o'clock in the 
morning is midnight for incanto.

1106
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,230
We must return it while we have time.

1107
01:20:09,730 --> 01:20:11,200
This room?

1108
01:20:12,940 --> 01:20:13,630
Yes.

1109
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:15,970
Take everything that we need.

1110
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,670
I'll see.

1111
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:44,560
"Dear Miss Claire, 
if they come and take me ..."

1112
01:20:44,700 --> 01:20:47,900
Please come and find me.

1113
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:49,800
Help me.

1114
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:54,640
I honestly do not want to go with them. 
With love, Angela. "

1115
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:35,710
Mang Domeng is one of them?

1116
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:36,220
Yes.

1117
01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:40,110
There are many, 
so no one can be trusted.

1118
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,290
We must hurry 
until her birthday comes.

1119
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:43,780
Good.

1120
01:22:11,860 --> 01:22:13,820
Well, where are you?

1121
01:22:19,230 --> 01:22:20,630
We need to go.

1122
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:30,770
We may not succeed. 
Maybe we can not return it.

1123
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:33,600
We are late.

1124
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,140
How are you going to get there?

1125
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,780
We have already arrived.

1126
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:04,830
Decisiveness can 
sometimes lead to a goal.

1127
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,410
Tess.

1128
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,000
Did you bring all her things?

1129
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,450
Where is Angela?

1130
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:15,640
Follow me.

1131
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:24,560
You know, Claire ...

1132
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:28,560
I do not understand why 
you can not let Angela go to heaven.

1133
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:31,560
If I were you, 
I would not count on it.

1134
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:33,490
Why do not you join us?

1135
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:37,270
Look, the holiday has just begun.

1136
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:05,600
Rita...

1137
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,330
What is it?

1138
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:08,170
This is my daughter.

1139
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:14,940
My child.

1140
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:18,510
Dont touch me.

1141
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:21,620
Don `t you remember me?

1142
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,750
I'm your mother.

1143
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:29,190
I brought you to this world 
and raised you until they took you.

1144
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:30,290
I do not have a mother.

1145
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:31,550
Go away.

1146
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:32,850
My child.

1147
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:34,730
She's not your daughter.

1148
01:24:36,930 --> 01:24:40,960
Whatever you do, 
she will not remember you.

1149
01:24:42,010 --> 01:24:43,910
She does not know another family ...

1150
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:46,910
except us.

1151
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:47,500
No.

1152
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,710
I'll take her back.

1153
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:52,520
Do not trust, Rita.

1154
01:24:52,820 --> 01:24:54,440
She chose to be incanto ...

1155
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:56,650
And became one of us.

1156
01:24:58,290 --> 01:24:58,720
No.

1157
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:02,920
Pssst.

1158
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,020
My child, come with me.

1159
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:08,470
I'll take you far.

1160
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,190
I do not want to become like them.

1161
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:13,770
I know why they are here.

1162
01:25:16,510 --> 01:25:18,740
Whatever you're up to, do not do it.

1163
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,470
Who are you to take 
the child away from your mother ...

1164
01:25:21,710 --> 01:25:24,980
If you are not your mother?

1165
01:25:25,150 --> 01:25:27,840
Angela asked me 
to save her from you ...

1166
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:30,010
Her father said so to her.

1167
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:35,450
It was not easy for me 
to leave your world.

1168
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:38,760
We need people to have children ...

1169
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,160
Then we take them back to our world.

1170
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,260
My love, let's take 
a picture with the child.

1171
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:47,830
Like most people ...

1172
01:25:48,510 --> 01:25:50,740
Gary did not know about our existence ...

1173
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:53,530
But even if we tried to hide ...

1174
01:25:53,980 --> 01:25:56,780
There are people whose 
feelings are open, they feel us.

1175
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,840
How can you say that?

1176
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:01,380
She is my wife. We live together.

1177
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:05,850
Once I gave life to 
a being different from us.

1178
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:10,060
Believe me, Gary, 
Isabel is incanto.

1179
01:26:10,690 --> 01:26:12,250
"Gary, I'm telling the truth."
- Get out!

1180
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,100
She is not a man,

1181
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:15,220
Gary ...

1182
01:26:15,530 --> 01:26:16,290
Pssst ...

1183
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,170
I thought...

1184
01:26:23,240 --> 01:26:25,000
For Gary it will be easy ...

1185
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:26,940
To accept my death.

1186
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,510
We preserve our earthly appearance ...

1187
01:26:30,950 --> 01:26:32,920
Until we give birth to a child.

1188
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:35,940
Then we are called by the wind ...

1189
01:26:36,250 --> 01:26:39,120
And so we die ...

1190
01:26:39,490 --> 01:26:41,550
And we can return to our world.

1191
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,260
Do not cry.

1192
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:56,100
Leave this world.

1193
01:26:56,410 --> 01:26:58,140
"You're a demon!"
- What are you doing?

1194
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:00,010
"I'm banishing you!"
"What are you doing with my wife?"

1195
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,640
"Gary, you have to believe me."
- Get out! Leave us alone!

1196
01:27:03,150 --> 01:27:06,210
Look at your wife! Look at her!

1197
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,690
My mission is not 
complete until I get my baby.

1198
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,990
Gary thought he could take it from me.

1199
01:27:21,730 --> 01:27:23,890
If he really loved Angela ...

1200
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,830
He would not take her away from us, 
in our world there is no sadness and problems.

1201
01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:32,880
Why are you so proud 
of your hearts and souls ...

1202
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,770
Because from them 
only pain and suffering?

1203
01:27:36,980 --> 01:27:38,810
I want to see Angela.

1204
01:27:39,650 --> 01:27:41,050
I want to talk to her.

1205
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:43,820
What for?

1206
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:45,380
Because I know...

1207
01:27:46,290 --> 01:27:47,880
She needs to make a choice.

1208
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,150
I want to know what she decided.

1209
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:52,420
Then I'll leave.

1210
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:54,690
We will see.

1211
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:21,280
Happy birthday, Angela.

1212
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:22,790
Happy Birthday!

1213
01:28:24,730 --> 01:28:27,200
You decided to become one of us ...

1214
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:32,890
And turn away from the 
people with whom you grew up?

1215
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:35,400
Angelie.

1216
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:36,700
Angelie.

1217
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:39,430
In the letter you asked me to come.

1218
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,840
You asked me not to give you to them, 
whatever happened.

1219
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:45,780
That's why I'm here.

1220
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:47,780
I was wrong.

1221
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:49,480
Here I am happy.

1222
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:51,490
They will take care of me.

1223
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:54,850
There I was lonely.

1224
01:28:55,260 --> 01:28:56,380
It is not true.

1225
01:28:57,390 --> 01:28:59,290
Do you remember Daddy?

1226
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,290
You said that 
he loved you very much.

1227
01:29:03,970 --> 01:29:08,840
He gave you a postcard 
on your last birthday.

1228
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,400
He said "I love you very much.

1229
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:19,180
I want you to grow up 
with a good heart and soul.

1230
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,720
Please, remember me.
- "Remember me...

1231
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:28,980
... everything I said and everything 
I taught you, even when I was not around.

1232
01:29:29,730 --> 01:29:31,090
Happy Birthday!

1233
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:32,760
With love, Dad "

1234
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:47,610
There is no more love 
than my love for you.

1235
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:50,470
Even if your mother were alive ...

1236
01:29:51,450 --> 01:29:55,250
She could not have 
dreamed of you the way I do ...

1237
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:58,480
And wish you the same happiness.

1238
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:04,430
And I hope you will always remember 
that only the pope has good intentions.

1239
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,860
I love you dad.

1240
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:12,670
And even when I do not ...

1241
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,830
Please remember 
- I will always be there to protect you ...

1242
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:24,210
And I'll watch that there 
is someone who really loves you.

1243
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,680
Why do you say that?

1244
01:30:30,850 --> 01:30:32,120
Angeli ...

1245
01:30:33,420 --> 01:30:35,190
Your cake.

1246
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:39,150
Blow the candle, make a wish.

1247
01:30:39,460 --> 01:30:41,220
Oh yeah.

1248
01:30:44,830 --> 01:30:49,670
I want my dad's eyesight back ...

1249
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,540
And I want, that we 
always remained together.

1250
01:31:00,620 --> 01:31:04,120
You know what he sacrificed ...

1251
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:08,520
To save you from this place.

1252
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:11,550
Angelie, you're not alone.

1253
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:14,820
I'm here.

1254
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:19,730
I'll take care of you. 
Me and Jeremy.

1255
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:22,140
Just promise me ...

1256
01:31:23,410 --> 01:31:25,970
That we will go home.

1257
01:31:27,310 --> 01:31:29,640
I love you very much, Angela.

1258
01:31:30,150 --> 01:31:33,670
We'll always be together. 
Nothing will separate us ...

1259
01:31:36,650 --> 01:31:39,990
Now that I understand that 
fate has brought us together.

1260
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,430
Miss Claire, 
please take me home.

1261
01:31:49,970 --> 01:31:51,590
You have to choose, Claire:

1262
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:54,530
Angela or the life of your husband?

1263
01:31:55,570 --> 01:31:56,870
What are you speaking about?

1264
01:31:57,540 --> 01:31:59,840
Did not you ask him to come here?

1265
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:06,440
Jeremiah!

1266
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:08,710
Jeremiah!

1267
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:10,180
Jeremiah!

1268
01:32:13,660 --> 01:32:14,620
Jeremiah!

1269
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:17,350
Choose.

1270
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:19,820
Angela or your husband?

1271
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,130
Do not touch her husband.

1272
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:30,360
I'll go with you when I turn eighteen.

1273
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:31,770
I promise.

1274
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:37,310
But if you offend them, 
I will never go with you.

1275
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:45,090
The girl made the decision.

1276
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:49,650
We can not resist it.

1277
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:57,000
Miss Claire, let's go.

1278
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,040
Faster, let's go.

1279
01:33:03,040 --> 01:33:03,470
Clare.

1280
01:33:03,710 --> 01:33:04,600
Rita, what's the matter?

1281
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:05,770
My child.
1,291
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:07,940
I'll never go with you.

1282
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:11,210
Let's go to!

1283
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,410
I'll stay here.

1284
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:16,080
Should I go if 
I can not be with my child?

1285
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:17,980
Leave.

1286
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:28,820
Miss Claire.

1287
01:33:54,020 --> 01:33:54,650
Clare?

1288
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:55,580
Clare!

1289
01:33:55,690 --> 01:33:56,230
Clare...

1290
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:57,780
It's me, Jeremy.

1291
01:33:58,030 --> 01:33:59,360
This is Jeremy.

1292
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:01,660
Jeremiah!

1293
01:34:02,530 --> 01:34:04,230
I've been looking everywhere for you.

1294
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:11,200
What happened?

1295
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,670
Long story.

1296
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:17,680
Everything is fine.

1297
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,980
Now I am here.

1298
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,850
Go home.

1299
01:34:31,030 --> 01:34:31,690
Clare.

1300
01:34:37,170 --> 01:34:38,830
This is Angela.

1301
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:41,430
She will live with us.

1302
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:46,540
Angelie, come here.

1303
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,900
This is your dad, Jeremy.

1304
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:51,070
Come here.

1305
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,860
"Hello, Mrs. Villamin?"
- Claire.

1306
01:35:11,970 --> 01:35:13,040
It's good that you are still awake.

1307
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,040
This is the worst trip of my life.

1308
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,700
Do you know where I am?

1309
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:18,430
Where are you?

1310
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:20,110
I'm in Laoag.

1311
01:35:20,240 --> 01:35:24,140
Your dorky assistant 
did not book me a flight to Manila!

1312
01:35:24,550 --> 01:35:26,450
Now I need to wait another two hours ...

1313
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:27,850
To fly away ...

1314
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:30,480
God, Claire, that's too much!

1315
01:35:30,650 --> 01:35:32,750
You can forget about the gift.

1316
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:35,250
I'll bring you Wigan sausages -

1317
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:57,240
Angelie, are you ready?

1318
01:35:57,680 --> 01:35:58,810
Do you want me to go with you?

1319
01:35:59,180 --> 01:36:00,710
Not necessary.

1320
01:36:01,980 --> 01:36:02,950
I can do it myself.

1321
01:36:03,090 --> 01:36:04,070
Bye, Mom.

1322
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:04,950
Kisses.

1323
01:36:04,950 --> 01:36:05,820
Bye, Daddy.

1324
01:36:05,820 --> 01:36:06,220
Have a rest.

1325
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:53,990
What happened?

1326
01:36:54,140 --> 01:36:55,900
Hey, are you okay?

1327
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,100
Why is she so pale? 
Who is she?

1328
01:36:58,340 --> 01:37:00,430
She's our new classmate ...

1329
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,740
From the province.

1330
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:04,480
That's her?

1331
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:07,410
Yes. Here is the call.

1332
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,380
Hey, classmate. It's time.

1333
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:23,430
- Oh my God!!
"I'm sorry, madam." I am so sorry.

1334
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:25,720
"Next time, neater."
- I want to go home.

1335
01:38:26,830 --> 01:38:27,590
What?

1336
01:38:28,060 --> 01:38:29,050
Why?

1337
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,660
Do not be afraid. 
You are very welcome here.

1338
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,470
Actually, I'm going to your class ...

1339
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,500
To introduce you to your new teacher.

1340
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:39,570
Oh, she's already here.

1341
01:38:39,780 --> 01:38:42,470
Miss Isabel, 
meet your new apprentice, Angela.

1342
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:44,310
Good morning,

1343
01:38:44,850 --> 01:38:46,180
Angelie.
