1
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,800
<b>THE OTHER HALF</b>

2
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,520
- Any relatives in Switzerland?
- No.

3
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,359
What kind of rep are you?

4
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,960
Hair products.

5
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,960
GENEVA

6
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,439
Hamid, look me in the eyes.

7
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,479
Can I still trust you?

8
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,880
Yes, of course.

9
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,400
Your papers, please.

10
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,600
Could I see your briefcase?

11
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,160
- What is this?
- A gift for a friend.

12
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,960
BRUSSELS

13
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,719
They checked my bag
on the train.

14
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,199
I hid the contents
in the toilet.

15
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:39,799
- Did you open the jar?
- Yes, of course.

16
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,839
You mustn't know
what you're carrying.

17
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,759
They were onto me

18
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,880
at the border
because of my passport.

19
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,200
They wouldn't have checked,
had you not opened the jar.

20
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,680
We'll talk about it
in my office tomorrow.

21
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,640
- Prayer?
- Yes, of course.

22
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,680
Hit me again, Anita!

23
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,560
Thanks.

24
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,880
I'd do her!

25
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,720
Say that again?

26
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,640
C'mon, say it again!

27
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Say it!

28
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,479
Enough!

29
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,560
Leave him alone!

30
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,640
I didn't say anything!

31
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,680
Wait for me outside.

32
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,199
How was your day?

33
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,599
You look tired.

34
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,079
Did you bring me back anything?

35
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,559
No.

36
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
Not even cream
or shampoo samples?

37
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,679
What are we doing on Saturday?

38
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,640
Did you invite anybody over?

39
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,719
- Are you ashamed of me?
- Are you surprised?

40
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,399
The way you flaunt your ass
at work!

41
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
Are you jealous?

42
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,159
It bothers you that
men pay attention to me?

43
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,200
You're such a jealous man!

44
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,479
In a month, we'll be able
to apply for a passport.

45
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,240
- Then you can leave me.
- I won't.

46
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,279
You don't need anybody.

47
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,519
Drop it.

48
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,400
Come pick me up tonight?

49
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,480
Don't forget the samples!

50
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,559
Hello? Louis?
Louis who?

51
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,520
I have no brother.
Not interested.

52
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,320
Hello?

53
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,080
I don't know you.

54
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,840
I have no brother called Louis.
Stop pissing me off!

55
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,279
Take a seat.

56
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,439
Here, new name, new passport,
so you needn't worry.

57
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,840
The cops are watching me.

58
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,679
- Did they question you?
- They called.

59
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:04,199
To tell you,
"This is the police"?

60
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,399
It's not funny.

61
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,439
They pretended
to be someone else.

62
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,560
- Who?
- My brother.

63
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,359
- You have a brother?
- Yeah.

64
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,919
I haven't seen him in 30 years.

65
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,919
It must be a cop ruse.
It scares me.

66
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,519
Why wouldn't it be your brother?

67
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,359
He doesn't know where I am.

68
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,720
I should stop traveling
for a while.

69
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,799
You have a new passport,
you can take a little trip.

70
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,359
Nothing unusual.

71
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,999
Really?

72
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,999
I'm fed up of taking risks
for next to nothing.

73
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,399
I carry fortunes for EUR 500!

74
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,040
Risks? At worst,
they send you back to Algeria.

75
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,759
It's your country.

76
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,919
I doubt you'd be willing
to go back.

77
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,719
I'll pay you EUR 3,000
for this trip.

78
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,719
It's for financing
a school in Saudi Arabia.

79
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,520
It's a privilege.
Think of the community.

80
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,600
Why so quiet?

81
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,479
The community, the fight...

82
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,999
Two years in jail make you see
things differently.

83
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,599
Don't talk to me like that.

84
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,239
The community
didn't send you to jail!

85
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,159
At one point,
I thought you were watching me.

86
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,079
I'm busy now, come by tonight.
We can talk quietly.

87
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,680
I'm buying dinner, OK?

88
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:00,279
It's Louis, I mean Lunes.
Do whatever you want, Hamid,

89
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,639
but Mom's in the hospital.

90
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,959
It's pretty serious.
She'd like to see you.

91
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,999
I'll be at the Neuchâtel train
station bar tomorrow morning.

92
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,519
I'll wait till 10 AM.

93
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:13,800
If you don't come, don't worry,
you'll never hear from me again.

94
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,840
- You're early.
- Can I have some fruit juice?

95
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Got your brother's message?

96
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,040
Why didn't you tell me
you had family in Switzerland?

97
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,960
I don't know anything about you.

98
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,800
It's as if you're hiding.

99
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,719
What are we doing on Saturday?

100
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,240
Did you invite anyone?

101
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,879
Wanna come have dinner
Saturday night?

102
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,919
- Leave him alone.
- What?

103
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,120
Nothing. He's my husband.

104
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,840
No luck.
Inviting people isn't my thing.

105
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,919
- What's that bag for?
- I gotta go.

106
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,360
When are you coming back?

107
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,919
You don't care about anything.

108
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,840
Me, you...

109
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,240
Hamid!

110
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,400
- Hello.
- Coffee, please.

111
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
- Hamid?
- Yes.

112
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,920
It's me, Louis! Lunes.

113
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,520
- Had a good trip?
- Yes.

114
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
No hug?

115
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,960
I've always dreamed of this.

116
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,480
- Shall we go?
- How did you find me?

117
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,679
- To find you?
- How'd you get my number?

118
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,479
It was in Mom's things.

119
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,679
She didn't know
I was in Brussels.

120
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,799
- She had your number in Algeria.
- She contacted me there?

121
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,600
Of course.

122
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,919
Shall I put some music on?

123
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,239
What do you like? Rock, blues...

124
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,520
What happened to her?

125
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,719
She was on her moped
and got hit by a truck.

126
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,919
- How come?
- That's what the police said.

127
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,519
I don't know her any more
than you do.

128
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:29,119
After your departure,
she left me with Grandma.

129
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,719
- I was 3.
- And I, 5.

130
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,359
She wanted to start over.
Her child was in the way.

131
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,600
I always pictured you living
happily with her in Switzerland.

132
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,759
Not at all.

133
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,639
- She wrote to me now and then.
- Really? What about?

134
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,680
That she wanted to come
to Algeria with you,

135
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,960
that she was thinking of me.

136
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,759
I'm about to see her
37 years later.

137
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,560
Can you believe it?

138
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,800
SWISS JURA

139
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,400
Did you talk to the doctor
since the accident?

140
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,039
Listen, the hospital called
this morning.

141
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,639
- Mom didn't make it.
- She died?

142
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,999
Why didn't you say so earlier?

143
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,919
- Drive me back to the station!
- It's a quick drive.

144
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,559
- Just see what my car's made of!
- Mom died and you talk cars?

145
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,119
Drive me back!

146
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,079
You can wait a bit.
We can get to know each other.

147
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,159
Drop me off anywhere.
I'll manage alone.

148
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,519
What's the rush? You can take
a memento from her house.

149
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,919
- I don't want one!
- It won't take long.

150
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,359
I said no!

151
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,279
We're almost there.
It's behind that hill.

152
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,760
Are you jerking me around?

153
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,200
You're insane!

154
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,520
OK.

155
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,760
I'll drive you back
after I call my girlfriend.

156
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,199
- Did you call your girlfriend?
- Yes.

157
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,679
- What's her name?
- Isabella.

158
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,359
She just called
on the other cell.

159
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,279
Spying on me?

160
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,719
She didn't pick up,

161
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,079
so I left her a message.

162
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,679
- Are you married?
- Yes.

163
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,920
Is she pretty?

164
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,080
When I was 5, Mom and I wanted
to come see you and Dad.

165
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,279
It was Christmastime.
I'd packed my suitcase.

166
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,279
We were in Grandma's kitchen
when Mom walked in.

167
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,239
She sat down at the table
and started to cry.

168
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,080
Grandma told me to go
to my room, to stay away.

169
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,439
I was scared.

170
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,160
Later, but much later,
she told me Dad had died.

171
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,760
- I gotta go back to Brussels.
- I tell you about Mom

172
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:51,999
- and you tell me about Dad.
- I've nothing to say.

173
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,719
I don't get it.
Aren't we brothers?

174
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,959
So? You want to make up
for 30 years in 5 minutes?

175
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,440
Yeah.

176
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,119
- Why are you driving so fast?
- Habit. I drive often.

177
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,879
I work for an art auction house
in Geneva.

178
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,559
I'm in charge of
security and shipping.

179
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,039
I also sell works of art:
Russian icons...

180
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,359
It's extra money.

181
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,440
Isa doesn't know anything.

182
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,359
- Shit!
- I told you, you were speeding.

183
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,760
Don't worry about it.

184
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,199
Hello.

185
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,159
- We were going a little fast.
- License and registration.

186
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:15,479
- We have a death in the family.
- Your papers?

187
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,519
- He's my brother.
- I don't drive.

188
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,839
- I'd like to see some ID.
- Why?

189
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,240
Don't argue.

190
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,760
I'll be right back.

191
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,000
They're such a pain.

192
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,999
- Follow us. We'll escort you.
- Why?

193
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,479
What is the problem? I'll pay
the ticket and we're good.

194
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,599
I asked you to follow us.
Got it?

195
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,720
No, but it's OK,
we'll follow you.

196
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,480
POLICE STATION

197
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,640
My name is Scherrer.
I'm with the Terrorist Squad.

198
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,039
- I'd like to talk to you.
- I have nothing to say.

199
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,160
I don't even know why I'm here.

200
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,359
- What do you do for a living?
- Hair products rep.

201
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,319
Really?
Why did you leave Algeria?

202
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,320
For no particular reason.

203
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,199
What about your 2-year stint in jail?

204
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,079
You had contact
with the Islamists.

205
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,839
You were once involved with ISF
and now with an illegal network.

206
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,000
You're a courier for the hawala.

207
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,679
Youssef Madani.

208
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,840
He's a friend.
We met at a wedding.

209
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,799
Brahim Khaffaf.

210
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,280
He owns a grocery store
in Geneva.

211
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,440
Isn't this you?

212
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,839
So?

213
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,720
I'm in front of a grocery store
talking to a grocer.

214
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,679
Three days ago,
you entered Switzerland

215
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:41,439
with a different passport
than the one you presented us.

216
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,879
We've been watching you
for a while now.

217
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,440
I don't understand.

218
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,199
The hawala is a system for
financing terrorist attacks.

219
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,159
People die because of you.
Do you even realize it?

220
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,439
I don't know who uses
the system. It's anonymous.

221
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,279
The hawala is the way
poor people transfer money.

222
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,719
Immigrants use it
to feed their families.

223
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,959
- Illegally.
- Your laws make it illegal.

224
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,359
You've everything.
We've nothing.

225
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,519
I'm asking you to collaborate,
not to make a political speech.

226
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,039
Otherwise, you'll be handcuffed
and sent to Algiers tomorrow.

227
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:22,120
- We don't want people like you.
- It's terrible there.

228
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,119
I want you to make a list of
everything you've delivered,

229
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,359
the names, addresses, codes

230
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,359
- and the amounts.
- You want me to betray friends?

231
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,079
I already told you,
it's an anonymous system.

232
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,799
Nobody knows what that money
is used for.

233
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,479
It's based on trust.

234
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,679
You don't have a Belgian
passport or refugee status,

235
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,440
collaborate or kiss
Europe goodbye.

236
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,679
No. I can't.

237
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,720
I couldn't live with myself.

238
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,040
Take him away.

239
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,919
What do they want?

240
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,519
- Wait!
- Why were you speeding?

241
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,560
- No talking for 24 hours.
- Hamid, I'll get you out.

242
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,759
Mr. Valence,

243
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,160
come into my office.

244
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:56,680
Your brother paid your bail.
He's waiting outside.

245
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,719
The examining judge
made this decision, not me.

246
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,320
Of course,
there's the funeral to attend.

247
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,839
You can't leave the country

248
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,000
and you have to provide us
with an address.

249
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,079
You will remain at the disposal
of the police 24 hours a day.

250
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,000
I expect to see you in my office
tomorrow at 8 AM.

251
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,560
Bring the list.

252
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,440
Hamid?

253
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,760
- Yes.
- I'm Isabella.

254
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,359
- Louis's girlfriend?
- Yes.

255
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,800
He went to get croissants.

256
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,479
Did you see that shop?

257
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,439
It's funny.

258
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,799
I wondered if I lived here,
what I'd pick

259
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,320
if I wanted to buy myself
a gift.

260
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,960
- What would you pick?
- I don't know!

261
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,239
Introduced yourselves yet?

262
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,319
Hamid, my brother.

263
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,959
Sounds funny.

264
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,159
- Were they a pain to you?
- Any idea where I was?

265
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:26,839
- What are you doing?
- I paid your bail.

266
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,720
The examining judge said
you have to be there at 8 AM.

267
00:30:28,721 --> 00:30:31,719
- What do they want?
- Why did you pay my bail?

268
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,199
- You couldn't stay in jail.
- I would've been out in 2 days.

269
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,799
That's what you think.

270
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,359
Shall we?
They won't wait for us.

271
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,359
They said you worked for
the hawala, some kind of mafia.

272
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,080
I didn't even know it existed.
Ever heard of it?

273
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,519
Let's say you live in Brussels

274
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,039
and you want to transfer money.

275
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,319
You go to a hawala shop
or restaurant, give money,

276
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,879
and they give you a code.

277
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,079
You call your payee,
give him the code,

278
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,319
so he's able to receive money
in a shop in his country

279
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,760
that's involved in the hawala,
right?

280
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,079
Billions are transferred
this way every year.

281
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,319
Without paying taxes!
600 billion dollars

282
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,359
are transferred without a trace.
It drives the cops mad!

283
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,279
But there's a weak link:
the couriers.

284
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,279
If the police ID them,
they can dismantle the network.

285
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,160
You're a courier, right?

286
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,440
That takes a lot of courage.

287
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,120
Cut it out, Louis.

288
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,639
- How much was my bail?
- CHF 30,000.

289
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,319
- Where did you find the money?
- I managed.

290
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,519
- I don't like this.
- You could thank me.

291
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,399
I didn't ask you for anything.

292
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,599
What do you mean, "you managed"?

293
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,240
I managed!
It's none of your business.

294
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,359
Lord, please take
Marie-Rose Valence

295
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,879
who passed away.

296
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:33,439
Lord Jesus,
we entrust her to You,

297
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,520
Who will open the gates
to Your heavenly kingdom.

298
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,880
Amen.

299
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,400
This is it!
I'll leave you now.

300
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,519
- You're not staying?
- Burning a body is a sin.

301
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,999
- Really?
- Did she want to be incinerated

302
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,760
- or was it your decision?
- It was hers.

303
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,080
I would've liked to see her.

304
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,800
We're waiting for the urn.

305
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,000
This feels very funny.

306
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,560
Death helps us focus
on what is important.

307
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,839
I don't need your pity.

308
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,319
What makes you think it's pity?

309
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,960
What is it, then?

310
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,800
I don't know. You looked sad.

311
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
Shall we go?

312
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,319
I only saw her once a year,
at Christmas.

313
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,920
Now that she's dead,
it's as if she were a stranger.

314
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,239
You can sleep here, if you want.
Does it suit you?

315
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,719
Yes.

316
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,560
I've to go back to Geneva.
I'm teaching at 8 AM.

317
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,919
If she goes back,
we can spend time together.

318
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,280
- Relax. What's the matter?
- It feels so small now.

319
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,240
The bed used to be there!

320
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,720
This used to be our bedroom!

321
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
- Can I shower?
- Go ahead.

322
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
What do you want to do now?

323
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,879
For me, it's simple.

324
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,120
I feel as though I haven't lived
all that I wanted to live.

325
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,840
That's it.

326
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,519
What about you?

327
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,999
Think this is the right time
to discuss this?

328
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,719
Yes.

329
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,800
You want to stay in Geneva
in your apartment?

330
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,160
You want to live here?

331
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,360
What about us?

332
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,080
Do you want kids?

333
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,599
They'd have to be
5 or 6 years old at birth.

334
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,480
- I can't stand babies.
- Be serious.

335
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,920
- Do you want kids or not?
- Yes.

336
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,880
Stop it!

337
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,920
What's the matter?
Don't you love me?

338
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,119
We invited the neighbors
for drinks.

339
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,800
I hope it won't be awkward.

340
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,680
- Won't you help me?
- Yes.

341
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,959
- Are you married?
- Yes.

342
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,959
I was denied political asylum.

343
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,239
It was the only way
I could stay in Belgium.

344
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,960
How's that going?
It mustn't be easy?

345
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,760
No, it isn't.

346
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,439
Can I come to Geneva with you?

347
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,080
I have some friends there.

348
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,759
- What about Louis?
- I'll tell him

349
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,120
I'd rather go to Geneva.

350
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,679
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

351
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,799
You don't drink
because you're religious?

352
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,239
No, I just don't want any.

353
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,120
- Shall I put some music on?
- Yes.

354
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,479
I'm sure this music reminded her
of her husband and sons.

355
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,360
I can't stand it. Stop it.

356
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,319
What was Dad like?

357
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,679
Did he play with you,
teach you things?

358
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,000
Mom never talked about him.

359
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,680
I found this postcard
in Mom's things.

360
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,719
"Dear Marie-Rose,
I hope you're well.

361
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,639
"Hamid is in good health.
He's in first grade.

362
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,479
"I hope to see you by the end
of the year here in Algeria.

363
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,719
"All my love, your husband,"

364
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,759
"Areski."

365
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,800
"Hamid is in good health."
I don't exist.

366
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,599
- He never mentions me.
- Drop it, it's been a long time.

367
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,640
I wanna know what Dad was like!

368
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,079
What about Mom?

369
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,479
She was nothing.
She was invisible, fleeting.

370
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,719
She couldn't stay home with you.
She had to work.

371
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,680
You can't judge her.

372
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,400
Mom's things are downstairs,
if you wanna see them.

373
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,519
This is it!

374
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,039
I put everything that's left
in this trashcan.

375
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,839
You can pick what you want.

376
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:57,759
You were quick! You emptied
everything in one day.

377
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,079
The longer you wait,
the harder it is.

378
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,400
- Tell me more about Algeria.
- There's nothing to say.

379
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,440
You must still
have contacts there?

380
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:15,439
- Is there evidence against you?
- Scherrer's imagining things.

381
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,080
You fill bank accounts.

382
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,039
Remember?

383
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,440
We used to play with it.

384
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,119
I called your uncle. He said
he didn't know where you lived.

385
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,919
Did he raise you?

386
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:38,560
- Did you argue?
- Is this an interrogation?

387
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,040
No, I'm your brother.

388
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,239
What is a brother?

389
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,559
What?

390
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,919
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

391
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,600
- Don't you see it bothers me?
- I want to get to know you.

392
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,520
Fine, but how do I know
you're my brother?

393
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,759
Very well,

394
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,359
I'm not your brother.

395
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,599
The door is open, you can leave.
C'mon, scram!

396
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,640
Get lost!

397
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,000
Don't leave me alone
with the guests!

398
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,680
Tell him about his father.
He knows nothing about him.

399
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,319
- Am I early?
- It doesn't matter.

400
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:49,519
I live next door.
I knew Marie-Rose well.

401
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,559
This is Django, her cat.
I took him in after the crash.

402
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,159
He was lost,

403
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,119
but maybe you want him back?

404
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,439
It's best if you keep him.

405
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,920
- Good evening.
- Come in.

406
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,559
We worked together for 20 years
in the factory.

407
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,640
Of course, I'll miss her.

408
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:42,080
She was a good woman.
A really good woman.

409
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,239
- This is Hamid, Louis's brother.
- Hello.

410
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,280
I gotta go.

411
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,119
- Don't you wanna hear the rest?
- She was a good person.

412
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,439
That's all I need to know.

413
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
Bye!

414
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,399
- What are you doing?
- Why do you own a weapon?

415
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,320
- You're a cop?
- You looked through my stuff?

416
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,720
You're a cop!

417
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,160
Stop it!

418
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,839
Come back, Hamid!

419
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
Hamid!

420
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:59,039
- What's going on?
- We had a fight.

421
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,240
We'll leave you, then.

422
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,440
- Bye.
- Wait!

423
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,559
I wanted to hear more
about my parents.

424
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,999
How was my dad?

425
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,320
Your mother was very strong,
very brave.

426
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,639
We were happy to see him leave.

427
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,960
Why?

428
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,039
Did he drink?

429
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,200
Was he violent?

430
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,640
What happened with Hamid?

431
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,640
I'm tired of being
kept in the dark.

432
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:02,720
- Isa...
- I don't need to know, right?

433
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,880
How did you find the money
for the bail?

434
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,560
It's a scheme of mine.

435
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,560
I didn't come all the way here
to hear this.

436
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,840
I wanted us to get closer,
to talk.

437
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:27,880
You must think I'm a fool.

438
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,440
Isa, wait! I'll explain.

439
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,759
I sold an icon that was stolen.

440
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,200
I have to give back that money.
The cops are watching me.

441
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,839
- You can't leave me now.
- You did this for your brother?

442
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,239
Yes... No, but I'm gonna put
an end to this.

443
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:59,759
You lied to me.
That's all you do.

444
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,119
Constantly.

445
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,720
Isa, wait.

446
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,360
I'm heading back to Geneva.

447
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,599
Sorry, it's a little messy.

448
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:56,400
I rushed to meet Louis as soon
as I found out about his mom.

449
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,159
I was gone 3 days,
but it seems so far away.

450
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,839
Three days?

451
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:07,119
- When did she pass away?
- Three days ago.

452
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,639
- That's not what Louis told you?
- No.

453
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,640
He's a little twisted.
I don't get it.

454
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,919
- What would you like to drink?
- Some wine.

455
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,919
What kind of work do you do?

456
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,919
I work with children

457
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,800
who have pronunciation
and comprehension problems.

458
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,239
- What do you do with them?
- Exercises.

459
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:46,279
I tell a child, "go in the room
and take the scissors,"

460
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:49,039
but he doesn't understand
the word "scissors."

461
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,439
So?

462
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,239
I go in the room with the child
and I tell him,

463
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,360
"This is the room.
These are the scissors."

464
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,919
- Did you take anything else?
- No.

465
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,840
Anyway, nobody wanted it.

466
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:16,239
Why don't you like this music?

467
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,719
My dad listened to it
all the time.

468
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,040
- How old were you when he died?
- Seven.

469
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,920
I don't know if our parents
even wanted us.

470
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,040
Why not?
Your parents loved each other.

471
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,399
They were brave.

472
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,480
An Algerian man,
a Swiss woman...

473
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,720
- How old are your students?
- Wanna see them?

474
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,759
Isa, open up!

475
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:15,639
I know you're there.
We have to talk.

476
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,479
Not now. Go home.

477
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,719
- No, let me in!
- Stop screaming!

478
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,480
I'll stay on the landing,
but open the door.

479
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,639
- Are you with someone?
- I'm with Hamid.

480
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,119
- Hamid?
- Don't start fighting again.

481
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,119
Hamid, come with me.
I paid your bail.

482
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,879
How much did the cops pay you?

483
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,279
What?
What are you doing in there?

484
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,880
Go home now. It's enough.

485
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,639
Open up!

486
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,639
Hamid, I'm your brother.

487
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,320
You can't do this.

488
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,480
Muslim, my ass!

489
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:13,440
I have to go.

490
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,640
You don't have to feel guilty.

491
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,600
I used to have a friend there
when I was 7.

492
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,079
Whenever I'd go sleep over,
his mom would sit

493
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:15,999
on the edge of the bed
and tell me a story.

494
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,720
A normal thing
in a normal family.

495
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,720
It made me cry.

496
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,279
Can we talk a little?

497
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:57,319
It's 2 AM. Who are you?

498
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:59,119
Who is it?

499
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:01,519
It'd be better inside.

500
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,759
- Please.
- No.

501
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,400
Leave or I call the cops.

502
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,480
Where's Louis?

503
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,120
He owes us CHF 30,000.

504
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,359
Shit!

505
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,720
What's with this mess?

506
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,960
Isa?

507
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,519
Who were those 2 brutes?

508
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,319
They were looking for you.
Who were they?

509
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,639
I'll pay for the damages.

510
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,440
What did they want? Why didn't
the cop downstairs intervene?

511
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,159
I owe them money.
I'll pay it back.

512
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,760
- Everything will be like before.
- You disgust me.

513
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,080
I didn't want this.

514
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:45,280
What did you two do?

515
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,479
What did you do with my brother?

516
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,680
He fucked me and made me come.

517
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,800
Happy now? You can leave.

518
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,920
Leave!

519
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,320
I'd rather be alone.

520
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,200
- Stop it!
- I could kill you!

521
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,080
Louis!

522
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,160
- Gimme back my money, asshole!
- Buzz off!

523
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:02,520
Get up!

524
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:11,280
Buzz off!

525
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,719
Fast!

526
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,760
Clear off!

527
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,320
What's this about?
Who are these people?

528
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,120
I acted as a go-between for them
and a collector.

529
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:32,359
It was a stolen icon.
I kept their money.

530
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:36,039
- I used it to bail you out.
- You did that for me?

531
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:38,919
It's the last time I deal.
I'm gonna stop this.

532
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:40,920
Let's go get a drink.

533
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,719
- Whisky, as usual?
- Coffee.

534
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,719
- Get a whisky for once.
- No.

535
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,159
We fought against them together,
we can have the same drink.

536
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,919
- So take a coffee, then.
- Two coffees and 2 whiskies.

537
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,160
OK.

538
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:40,760
It's our first photo together.

539
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,639
What is Isa doing now?

540
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,360
I got it all wrong with her.

541
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,040
Excuse me, gentlemen.

542
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,640
- Two whiskies. Enjoy!
- Thanks.

543
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,800
Sometimes, when I was a kid,
at Grandma's, I wouldn't sleep.

544
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:15,680
I would think about you.

545
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:20,960
I'd tell myself you were doing
the same thing.

546
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,320
So I'd imagine all the silly
things we'd do together:

547
01:03:24,321 --> 01:03:27,880
go to the movies, play soccer,
flirt with girls.

548
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:32,719
Things were different for me.

549
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:37,000
I thought you and Mom
were a lot luckier than I was.

550
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,999
Why did you stay there
after he died?

551
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,279
My uncle came to get me.
He took me in.

552
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:48,840
He wanted me
to have a Muslim education.

553
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,160
He was tyrannical.

554
01:03:55,240 --> 01:03:58,119
I've only known people like
that all my life.

555
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,120
Was Dad like that too?

556
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:08,280
He was weak, fragile,
a weird man...

557
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,960
He liked gambling, showing off.

558
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,519
He tried to work
but never managed to keep a job.

559
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,440
So he went back.

560
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,000
I think I drank too much.

561
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,120
For the first time,
I feel like you're my brother.

562
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:36,040
It's moving.

563
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,639
Let's go to Algeria together,

564
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,440
so you can show me
your playground, your school.

565
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,519
I can't go back.
I'd end up in jail.

566
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:57,239
Scherrer'll send me back
if I don't collaborate.

567
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,240
And yet, I can't do it.

568
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,799
I decided to stop the hawala.

569
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,319
I made my decision in Brussels
before I left.

570
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,879
I was only doing it
for the money.

571
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,399
You're not going
to your appointment?

572
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,239
You'll lose your bail.

573
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,560
I don't care.

574
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,400
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

575
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:30,360
- Good evening, how are you?
- OK.

576
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,719
I was wrong about you.

577
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,480
I thought you were working
for the cops.

578
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,159
I need to use the men's room.

579
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,600
The drinks
are making me nauseous.

580
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,999
- Why did you lie to me?
- What?

581
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,159
She died 3 days ago.

582
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:38,839
Why didn't you tell me anything
when you called me in Brussels?

583
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,679
Why did you tell me
she was in the hospital?

584
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,519
I had to meet you, to get you
to come to Switzerland.

585
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:47,600
If you don't tell me everything,
I'm leaving. It's over.

586
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:53,039
- Scherrer forced me to do this.
- Scherrer?

587
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,720
He gave me your address.

588
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,839
So Scherrer is behind the story
with the Russians too?

589
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,719
- He forced me.
- Why?

590
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,239
They came
so you'd buy the bail story.

591
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,919
They were cops, actually.
He told me you were dangerous,

592
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:12,279
that you were an Islamist
involved in the hawala.

593
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,198
That's why
they were watching you.

594
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:16,640
He said I could save lives.
What would you have done?

595
01:07:16,641 --> 01:07:19,320
I didn't know you!

596
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,160
What I did was lame.
I messed up everything.

597
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,199
And yet,
I always dreamed of meeting you.

598
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,400
Don't come near me!
I could kill you.

599
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:31,399
I was facing charges
for trafficking.

600
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,599
My hands were tied.
I had to accept.

601
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,040
Why are you talking to me
in Arabic?

602
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:41,999
I was ready to trust you!
Screw other people, not me!

603
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,640
I never want to see you again!

604
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:32,519
- Hi, it's me.
- Hamid? Where are you?

605
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,879
In Geneva.

606
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,519
I have problems with the police
because of Algeria.

607
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,079
- I have to leave.
- Where are you gonna go?

608
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,039
- Want me to come along?
- No.

609
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:44,519
So I won't see you again?

610
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,959
I'll try to call,
I just wanted to say bye.

611
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,159
Thanks for all the things
you've done for me.

612
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:54,400
I'm sorry.
You deserved better.

613
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:58,720
I hope we'll meet again
some day.

614
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,680
Please forgive me.

615
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,040
Ciao.

616
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,600
So?

617
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:13,039
I was supposed to go to the
police this morning but didn't.

618
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,679
They're after you.

619
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,719
- They want to nab you.
- I know.

620
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,759
They blocked one of my accounts.

621
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,319
- What did you tell them?
- Nothing. They wanna deport me.

622
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,679
I have to leave Switzerland.
Can you help?

623
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:30,200
I spoke to Youssef on the phone.
You left without saying bye.

624
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,199
Did he tell you about the jars?

625
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:36,599
I did that to save your bacon.

626
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,879
I traveled a lot.
I know the network.

627
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,639
I won't rat you out,
even if you don't help me.

628
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,759
Calm down, Hamid.

629
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,599
I'll organize your trip
to Marseille.

630
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:49,799
- Need a new passport?
- Yes, fast.

631
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:51,520
Meet you at 5 at the hammam.

632
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,879
There's a hotel near the hammam,
if you want to rest.

633
01:10:55,880 --> 01:10:57,639
Why not.

634
01:10:57,640 --> 01:10:59,479
The owner is a friend.

635
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,119
I'll call him
and then get back to you.

636
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,920
By tonight, you'll be in France.

637
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,960
Yes, I'm here. Thanks.

638
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,680
This way.

639
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:21,319
We lost track of him
because of you.

640
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:24,799
You shook us off at 3 AM
and turned off your cell phone.

641
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,799
- We had an agreement.
- Yes, to bring him in

642
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,319
for questioning,
but you locked him up.

643
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:37,319
- You can't tell us what to do.
- What about the bail story

644
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:40,199
and the 2 Russians,
your men,

645
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,239
hired to lure my brother in?

646
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,399
That wasn't part of the deal,
and yet, I played along.

647
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:48,239
Did you get any info?

648
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:52,080
He didn't trust me
and he was right not to.

649
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:06,239
I'm stopping everything.

650
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,999
You didn't obtain any info

651
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,199
and you expect us to forget
your icon trafficking?

652
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:16,679
I did everything I could
and more, much more!

653
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:18,959
- It's gone too far.
- Not in these cases.

654
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,479
If he weren't dangerous,
he would've showed up at 8 AM.

655
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,599
Why did your 2 Russian cops
wreck my girlfriend's apartment?

656
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,239
'Cause he's dangerous?

657
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,879
I don't like your methods,
Mr. Scherrer.

658
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,120
You used me.

659
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:37,199
If you don't want to retract
the charges, I don't care.

660
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,879
I'm fed up and ashamed of this,
you understand?

661
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,679
I don't!

662
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:46,360
We're fighting terrorism
and you betrayed me!

663
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:50,439
Sir,

664
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:53,480
- we found him.
- Don't move, I'll be back.

665
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,239
He's in a hammam.

666
01:15:56,240 --> 01:15:58,240
A hammam?

667
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:27,360
Rashid just called.
Your passport's ready.

668
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,199
He'll come with you
to Marseille.

669
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:34,280
Everything's OK.
You can relax.

670
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,239
There's only one hammam
in Geneva? What's the address?

671
01:16:53,240 --> 01:16:55,240
Yes, I know the place. Thanks.

672
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,000
- This way.
- Thanks.

673
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,199
- Hamid?
- What are you doing here?

674
01:18:35,200 --> 01:18:36,760
I'm here to help you.

675
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:41,919
Listen to me, Hamid.

676
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:43,800
Listen to me. Please, Hamid.

677
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,639
The cops know you're here.

678
01:18:46,640 --> 01:18:47,640
Leave!

679
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:53,680
Wait! The clothes!

680
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:25,640
Let me go through.

681
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:29,360
Buzz off!!

682
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:04,280
Rashid, don't stay there.
Go get the car!

683
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,200
Hamid!

684
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,200
- Scram!
- Listen...

685
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:17,960
- Listen...
- Police! Stop!

686
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,840
- Get in!
- I can't leave him here.

687
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,880
Quick!

688
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,039
No!

689
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:33,880
- Get in!
- No!

690
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:40,080
- Are you gonna be OK?
- It's fine. It's nothing.

691
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:48,520
It's OK.

692
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:01,560
Do you have the keys?

693
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,080
In my pocket.

694
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,840
- I'll go get the car.
- Let's go together.

695
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,080
Police! Don't panic.
Don't move. Everything's fine.

696
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,400
Face against the wall!

697
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,160
The 3 men on the right.
Stand up.

698
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,040
Surround the car!

699
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,120
On the floor!

700
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,240
Against the wall! Fast!

701
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:41,840
Come forward. Against the wall.

702
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,759
Careful, he must be armed.

703
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,280
Search him! Go ahead.

704
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,520
CROIX-DE-ROZON CUSTOMS

705
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:43,359
It happened in December.

706
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:45,159
I was 7 years old.

707
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,759
I was coming home from school.
It was dark outside.

708
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,359
I found him in the kitchen.
He'd hanged himself.

709
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,439
He was just like you.

710
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:57,079
He was lawless.

711
01:22:57,080 --> 01:22:59,599
Always short of money.

712
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,799
He wanted to be loved

713
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,199
but did everything he could
for us to hate him.

714
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:08,079
- Did you hate him?
- I was angry at him

715
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,400
because he brought me there.

716
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:15,640
- Are you still upset with him?
- No.

717
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,280
Are you upset with me?

718
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,200
No.

719
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,320
