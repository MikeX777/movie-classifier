180
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,501
WAIT FOR ME
IN THE CAR?

181
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:43,736
OK.

182
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,738
ALL RIGHT?

183
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:07,493
TRACY, IT'S ME AGAIN.

184
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,161
WHAT? WHAT?

185
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,229
THAT WASN'T
A DREAM YOU HAD.
IT WAS REAL.

186
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,532
WHERE ARE YOU?

187
00:12:13,532 --> 00:12:15,367
IN THE BACK SEAT.

188
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,874
WELL?

189
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:25,043
DISAPPOINTED?

190
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:27,912
OH, GOSH, NO...
GOD, SIR.

191
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:31,083
WHY--WHY WOULD I BE
DISAPPOINTED, SIR?

192
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:34,787
ARE YOU REALLY GOD, SIR?

193
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,188
FORGET THE SIR.
JUST PLAIN GOD.

194
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:39,058
THE OWNER
OF THE STORE.

195
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,694
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE MAN UPSTAIRS.

196
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:44,997
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMEHOW I THOUGHT
YOU'D LOOK HOLIER...

197
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:47,064
AND MORE FANCY,
SORT OF.

198
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:51,036
I MEAN,
LIKE WITH A CROWN
AND A LONG BEARD

199
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,037
AND A FLOWING
WHITE ROBE.

200
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,040
YOU'RE THINKING OF
CHARLTON HESTON.

201
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,242
I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

202
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,510
IT'S JUST THAT--

203
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:02,181
THAT I GUESS
I EXPECTED YOU
TO LOOK MUCH OLDER.

204
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,251
THANKS, TRACY.
I TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

205
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:06,384
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

206
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,853
WHO KNOWS?

207
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,222
AFTER THE FIRST
2 MILLION YEARS,
I STOPPED COUNTING.

208
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,526
IT'S AWKWARD
TALKING LIKE THIS.

209
00:13:14,893 --> 00:13:16,995
WOW! HOW'D
YOU DO THAT?

210
00:13:16,995 --> 00:13:18,830
IF I COULD PART
THE RED SEA,

211
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:22,300
I CAN CERTAINLY
MOVE TO THE FRONT
OF A CAR.

212
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,238
IT'S REFRESHING
TALKING TO A YOUNG
LADY LIKE YOU.

213
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,341
TAKES MY MIND OFF
SOME OF MY PROBLEMS.

214
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,475
YOU HAVE PROBLEMS?

215
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:33,545
YEAH. I'M NOT ALWAYS
ON CLOUD NINE.

216
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,113
THEY'RE STILL NOT
GETTING MY MESSAGE.

217
00:13:36,114 --> 00:13:38,517
I'M JUST NOT IN
PEOPLE'S THOUGHTS.

218
00:13:38,517 --> 00:13:41,219
THEY DON'T
BELIEVE IN ME
LIKE THEY SHOULD.

219
00:13:41,219 --> 00:13:44,890
I DO, AND I'M NOT
SAYING THAT JUST
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE.

220
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,891
I KNOW, BUT
THERE ARE PEOPLE

221
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,962
WHO THINK OF ME
ONLY A COUPLE
OF TIMES A YEAR.

222
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,264
THEN OTHERS DON'T
THINK OF ME AT ALL

223
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,200
UNTIL THAT
VERY LAST MINUTE--

224
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,203
AND THEN, BOY, DO I
HEAR FROM THEM.

225
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,206
PEOPLE HAVE TO BE
REMINDED THAT
I'M STILL AROUND.

226
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:03,241
THEN COME UP WITH ONE
OF YOUR BIG MIRACLES.

227
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,376
THAT WOULD REALLY
SHAKE THEM UP.

228
00:14:05,376 --> 00:14:08,045
AH. PEOPLE
REMEMBER THE MIRACLE

229
00:14:08,046 --> 00:14:10,048
AND FORGET
WHY I DID IT.

230
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:12,751
I'VE GOT IT.
MY DAD'S IN THAT BUSINESS.

231
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,119
YOU SHOULD ADVERTISE.

232
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,720
TELEVISION, RADIO,

233
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,322
BILLBOARDS, NEWSPAPERS.

234
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:18,657
GET A SLOGAN.

235
00:14:18,657 --> 00:14:20,292
A SLOGAN?

236
00:14:20,292 --> 00:14:23,528
TRACY, I'M NOT A TUBE
OF TOOTHPASTE.

237
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:24,963
SLOGANS REALLY WORK.

238
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,165
YOU'LL BECOME
A HOUSEHOLD WORD.

239
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,534
HOUSEHOLD WORD.

240
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:32,805
YEAH. THAT WOULD BE
NICE FOR A CHANGE.

241
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:36,942
ALL RIGHT, TRACY.
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF
A JOB.

242
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,277
YOU THINK
OF A SLOGAN,

243
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,212
AND I'LL SPREAD IT
AROUND.

244
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,681
I'LL ASK MY DAD.
HE'S GREAT.

245
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:46,017
NO. I HAVEN'T
BEEN DOING TOO WELL
WITH GROWNUPS LATELY.

246
00:14:46,017 --> 00:14:47,820
I'D RATHER
IT CAME FROM YOU.

247
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,623
ME? I'M THE WORLD'S
WORST WRITER,

248
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,891
AND MY SPELLING
IS THE PITS.

249
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:55,026
I DON'T TAKE OFF
FOR SPELLING.

250
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:56,962
SEE, IF IT COMES
FROM YOU,

251
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:59,564
IT'LL BE SOMETHING
THAT YOUR FRIENDS
CAN UNDERSTAND.

252
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,601
THAT WAY, I'LL HAVE
THE CHILDREN
ON MY SIDE.

253
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:05,403
AND WHEN THEY
GROW UP, I'LL HAVE<i>
 THEIR</i> CHILDREN.

254
00:15:05,403 --> 00:15:07,239
ONCE YOU'VE GOT
THE CHILDREN,

255
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,840
THAT'S
THE BALL GAME.

256
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,143
THEN I'LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE
OF A FEW THINGS--

257
00:15:12,143 --> 00:15:13,745
LIKE ALL THAT
POLLUTION.

258
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:16,815
AND HAVE YOU NOTICED
YOU'RE RUNNING OUT
OF EAGLES?

259
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:21,119
AND THERE ARE
A FEW VOLCANOES THAT
NEED COOLING OFF.

260
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:22,921
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
TRACY?

261
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:26,558
WILL YOU COME UP
WITH A SLOGAN?

262
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:28,660
OK. I'LL SURE TRY.

263
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,862
GOOD.

264
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:33,165
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

265
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,699
NOBODY ELSE WILL,
EITHER.

266
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:37,502
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN SEE
OR HEAR ME.

267
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,872
TELL THEM ABOUT
OUR VISITS, THEY'LL
THINK YOU'RE, UM...

268
00:15:40,872 --> 00:15:41,939
BONKERS?

269
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,575
DEFINITELY.

270
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:47,145
THEY GAVE SOME
OF MY BEST PEOPLE
A PRETTY BAD TIME.

271
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:49,081
HERE COMES
YOUR FATHER.

272
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,920
HERE YOU GO.

273
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,189
SORRY I TOOK SO LONG.

274
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:04,029
OK. READY
FOR YOUR MOVIE?

275
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,698
YEP.

276
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,940
THREE LASER FIGHTS,
A COLLISION OF PLANETS?

277
00:16:16,941 --> 00:16:18,510
YOU DON'T EVEN WATCH.

278
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:21,113
HALFWAY
THROUGH THE MOVIE,
YOU WANT TO GO HOME.

279
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,447
YOU OK?

280
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:23,982
SORRY, DADDY.

281
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:26,251
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE SORRY.

282
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,622
DADDY?

283
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,522
HMM?

284
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,858
LET'S SAY YOU HAVE
A BIG NEW CLIENT

285
00:16:33,858 --> 00:16:37,060
AND YOU NEED
A REAL SUPER SLOGAN.

286
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,331
WHERE DO YOU START?

287
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:43,167
WELL, UH...

288
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:45,270
FIRST YOU EXAMINE
THE PRODUCT.

289
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,771
YOU TRY TO PICK OUT

290
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:49,174
THE SINGLE MOST
IMPORTANT THING
ABOUT IT--

291
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,076
THE THING THAT'LL
MAKE IT SELL--

292
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,012
LIKE, UM...WELL,
TAKE POTATO CHIPS,
FOR EXAMPLE.

293
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:57,482
NO. SOMETHING BIGGER.
MORE IMPORTANT.

294
00:16:57,482 --> 00:16:59,351
IT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER.

295
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,619
A PRODUCT'S
A PRODUCT.

296
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,220
THE PRINCIPLE
IS THE SAME.

297
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,622
WELL, LET'S SAY YOU'RE
SELLING A PERSON...

298
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:05,757
OK.

299
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:07,159
A VERY IMPORTANT PERSON,

300
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:08,927
LIKE, UH...

301
00:17:08,926 --> 00:17:11,862
WELL, LET'S SAY...

302
00:17:11,863 --> 00:17:13,432
GOD.

303
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:17,702
GOD.

304
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:19,570
I DON'T THINK I'D
HANDLE THAT ACCOUNT.

305
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,307
ONE MISTAKE AND
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE
THERE.

306
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,309
DON'T TRY AND GET
OUT OF IT, DADDY.

307
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,511
HOW WOULD YOU
SELL GOD?

308
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:28,414
OK. GOD.

309
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,383
GOD. WELL...

310
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:35,421
FIRST I'D, UH,
MAKE A LIST OF
HIS GOOD QUALITIES--

311
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,988
YOU KNOW, HIS MOST
SALABLE FEATURES--

312
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:40,992
THEN I'D COME UP
WITH A NICE
LOW-KEY SLOGAN.

313
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:44,797
THEN I'D MEET HIM
FOR LUNCH AND
PITCH IT TO HIM.

314
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,231
AND THEN?

315
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:48,200
IF HE LIKES IT,
I'LL PICK UP THE TAB.

316
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,502
IF NOT, I'LL LET HIM
PICK IT UP.

317
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,537
WHAT'S ALL THIS STUFF
ABOUT GOD?

318
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:54,305
SOME SCHOOL PROJECT,
OR--

319
00:17:54,305 --> 00:17:56,809
SORT OF.
IT'S AN ASSIGNMENT
I JUST GOT.

320
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,543
OH, I SEE.

321
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,418
BEFORE I DROP
YOU OFF,

322
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,553
I WANT TO PICK UP
JOAN.

323
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:10,555
THAT OK?

324
00:18:10,555 --> 00:18:11,657
OK.

325
00:18:18,563 --> 00:18:20,098
THERE SHE IS.

326
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:21,667
[HONK HONK]

327
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:25,336
YEP, THERE THEY ARE.

328
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:27,239
WOULD YOU STOP
TALKING ABOUT HER--

329
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,240
BIG BOOBS?

330
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,474
OH, COME ON.

331
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,043
YOU LIKE KNOCKERS
BETTER?

332
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:34,412
COULD WE
JUST DROP THEM--
UH, DROP IT?

333
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,090
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

334
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,125
MMM. YOU TELL ME.

335
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,427
MMM.

336
00:18:49,761 --> 00:18:51,230
HI, STACY.

337
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,931
TRACY.

338
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:54,932
OH, UH, OF COURSE.

339
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,301
UH, OH, WHAT'S THAT?

340
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,069
IT'S A PRESENT
MY DAD GOT ME.

341
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,870
OPEN IT.

342
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:01,573
UM...I--

343
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:02,708
AAH!

344
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,645
CUTE. THANK YOU.

345
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,894
HI, MOM.

346
00:19:22,894 --> 00:19:24,162
HI. HOW WAS THE MOVIE?

347
00:19:24,162 --> 00:19:25,230
DUMB.

348
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,165
AW.

349
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:28,800
HOW WAS
THE EGG ROLL?

350
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,934
GOOD.

351
00:19:29,934 --> 00:19:31,569
AND HIS GIRLFRIEND?

352
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:32,604
BIG.

353
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:33,772
HMM.

354
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:37,242

00:27:55,706 --> 00:27:58,876
I MADE MY OWN MOLD
AND THREW IT AWAY.

530
00:27:58,876 --> 00:28:01,946
YOU KNOW, THIS ISN'T
EXACTLY EASY.

531
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:05,416
I DIDN'T SAY IT WOULD BE.
ONE MORE WEEK.

532
00:28:05,416 --> 00:28:07,217
JUST A WEEK?

533
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:08,586
THAT'S LONG ENOUGH.

534
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:12,323
LOOK WHAT I
ACCOMPLISHED IN A WEEK,
AND WITHOUT COMPUTERS.

535
00:28:12,323 --> 00:28:15,626
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A MATH TEST COMING UP.

536
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:17,929
ONE WEEK.

537
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:21,799
I SAY IF YOU DON'T
SET DEADLINES,
NOTHING HAPPENS.

538
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,368
CAN I ASK MY DAD
FOR HELP?

539
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:26,271
IN MATH, SURE.

540
00:28:27,438 --> 00:28:30,441
WHAT ABOUT SHINGO?
CAN HE HELP ME?

541
00:28:30,441 --> 00:28:31,576
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND?

542
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:34,012
YEAH, SHINGO CAN HELP.

543
00:28:35,012 --> 00:28:37,581
WE'LL DO
THE BEST WE CAN.

544
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,383
WE'LL REALLY TRY.

545
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:44,122
I DON'T SEE WHY
YOU HAVE TO
HAVE IT SO FAST.

546
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,261
TRACY?

547
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,698
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?

548
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:56,701
NOTHING. UM, NOBODY.

549
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,137
YOU WERE JUST
TALKING TO SOMEONE.

550
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:03,207
THAT? OH, I WAS TALKING
BACK TO THE TELEVISION.

551
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,978
THE SET ISN'T EVEN ON.

552
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,213
I TURNED IT OFF.

553
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,181
IT WAS SOME DUMB
COMMERCIAL.

554
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,251
THEY'RE ALWAYS
TRYING TO SELL
YOU SOMETHING.

555
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,754
HOW ABOUT, &quot;YOU CAN
BE SURE IF IT'S GOD&quot;?

556
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:19,756
NO, IT HAS
TO BE ORIGINAL.

557
00:29:19,757 --> 00:29:21,626
WE'VE BEEN AT IT
FOR HOURS.

558
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,161
LET'S GO HOME.
I'M STARVED.

559
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:26,030
WAIT! I THINK I'M
ON TO SOMETHING.

560
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,665
I LIKE IT. LET'S GO.

561
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,767
I DIDN'T SAY IT YET.

562
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:33,838
HOW ABOUT,
&quot;BUY GOD. B-U-Y&quot;?

563
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,473
GREAT. LET'S GO.

564
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,041
NAH,
IT'S TOO COMMERCIAL.

565
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:38,408
HE WOULDN'T LIKE THAT.

566
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:41,012
YOU KNOW HIM
BETTER THAN I DO.

567
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,714
HOW ABOUT, &quot;TRY GOD&quot;?

568
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:43,848
GREAT.

569
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:44,849
&quot;GOOD GOD.&quot;

570
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:45,950
THAT'S EVEN GREATER.

571
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,151
&quot;GREAT GOD.&quot;

572
00:29:47,151 --> 00:29:47,951
PERFECT!

573
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:51,155
NO, IT JUST MISSES.

574
00:29:51,155 --> 00:29:52,923
HOW COME EVERYTHING
JUST MISSES?

575
00:29:52,923 --> 00:29:54,592
I DON'T KNOW.

576
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,194
IT'S JUST A GUT FEELING.

577
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:58,663
THAT'S AN ADVERTISING
EXPRESSION.

578
00:29:58,663 --> 00:30:00,565
I'VE GOT
A GUT FEELING, TOO.

579
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,100
I'M HUNGRY.

580
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,001
WE'LL THINK GOD
TOMORROW.

581
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:06,070
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

582
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,804
I SAID WE'LL
THINK GOD TOMORROW.

583
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:08,806
THAT'S IT!

584
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,841
WHAT'S IT?

585
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,073
THINK GOD! THINK GOD!

586
00:30:11,074 --> 00:30:12,944
THAT'S A TERRIFIC SLOGAN!

587
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,145
OH, SHINGO,
YOU SAVED THE DAY.

588
00:30:15,145 --> 00:30:17,581
&quot;THINK GOD.&quot;
HE'LL LOVE IT.

589
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,690
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

590
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:28,759
WHO IS SHE TALKING TO?

591
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:32,496
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT KID.

592
00:30:32,496 --> 00:30:36,200
IT'S THE SECOND
TIME I'VE SEEN
HER DO THAT.

593
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,270
HARRIET, LOOK AT THE WAY
SHE'S CARRYING ON.

594
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,972
POOR TRACY.

595
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:42,807
POOR PAULA.

596
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,844
I WOULDN'T WANT
TO BE HER MOTHER.

597
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:52,517
THINK GOD. HMM. YEAH.

598
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,618
THINK GOD.

599
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:56,387
VERY INTERESTING.

600
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,989
IT'S GOT A MESSAGE,
IT'S SHORT,

601
00:30:58,989 --> 00:31:01,592
AND TELLS IT ALL.

602
00:31:01,592 --> 00:31:04,929
TRACY, I REALLY LIKE IT.

603
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:07,098
THANK GOD.

604
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:10,201
THAT'S GOOD, TOO,
BUT LET'S GO
WITH &quot;THINK GOD.&quot;

605
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,002
SHINGO CAME UP
WITH THAT ONE.

606
00:31:12,002 --> 00:31:13,571
I HAD A HUNCH HE WOULD.

607
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,707
HOW ARE YOU
GOING TO SPREAD
THE SLOGAN AROUND?

608
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,310
YOU'VE DONE SUCH
A GOOD JOB,

609
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,012
I'M GOING
TO HAVE YOU DO IT.

610
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:24,014
ME? I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

611
00:31:24,014 --> 00:31:26,149
WHY NOT START
WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

612
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:28,752
BUT A WHOLE BIG
ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN?

613
00:31:28,752 --> 00:31:30,154
HOW WOULD I DO THAT?

614
00:31:30,154 --> 00:31:31,889
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.

615
00:31:31,889 --> 00:31:33,290
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

616
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,059
WHY DON'T YOU
PICK ON SOMEBODY

617
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,161
WHO ISN'T BEHIND
IN HER HOMEWORK?

618
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,898
I'VE PICKED ON
SOME GOOD PEOPLE.

619
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,765
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY
TO BE IN THEIR COMPANY.

620
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:44,468
WELL, OK.

621
00:31:44,468 --> 00:31:48,506
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
NOT EXACTLY EASY
TO TURN DOWN.

622
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:54,111
SO THAT'S WHAT
WE'VE GOT TO DO--

623
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:56,647
WRITE &quot;THINK GOD&quot;
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

624
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,983
ON WALLS, ON SIDEWALKS,

625
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,586
WE'VE GOT TO STICK SIGNS
ON TREES,

626
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,189
CAR BUMPERS,
TELEPHONE POLES,
EVERYWHERE.

627
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:08,625
WE WANT IT ALL OVER.
&quot;THINK GOD.&quot;

628
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,994
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

629
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,061
WHAT?

630
00:32:11,061 --> 00:32:12,629
I THINK
YOU'RE A LOONY.

631
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:14,932
[LAUGHTER]

632
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,135
IF I'M GOING
TO WRITE ON WALLS,

633
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,069
I'M NOT WRITING
&quot;THINK GOD.&quot;

634
00:32:19,069 --> 00:32:21,272
THE THINGS
YOU WRITE ON WALLS

635
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,573
WOULD FOG UP
YOUR GLASSES.

636
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,411
COME ON, YOU GUYS.
LET TRACY TALK.

637
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,213
LISTEN.
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

638
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:31,950
WE ALL TAKE GOD
TOO MUCH FOR GRANTED.

639
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,485
WE SHOULD REMIND PEOPLE
TO THINK ABOUT HIM.

640
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,353
IF NOT FOR HIM,
WE WOULDN'T BE HERE.

641
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:39,790
THAT WILL SHAKE UP
MY PARENTS.

642
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,992
HA HA HA!

643
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,992
HA HA HA!

644
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:43,094
I THINK TRACY'S GOT
A NEAT IDEA.

645
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,829
LET'S DO SOMETHING GOOD
FOR A CHANGE.

646
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,197
LET'S VOTE. ALL IN FAVOR,
RAISE YOUR HANDS.

647
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:49,533
YAY!

648
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:49,533
YAY!

649
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:49,533
YAY!

650
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:49,533
YAY!

651
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,101
WHAT IS THIS?

652
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:53,104
WHAT ARE WE,
RELIGIOUS FREAKS?

653
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,506
NEXT YOU'LL HAVE US
SHAVING OUR HEADS.

654
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:57,508
I'VE HEARD
SOME DUMB IDEAS,

655
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:59,443
I'VE HEARD SOME
CRAZY IDEAS,

656
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:01,946
BUT THIS ONE
TAKES THE CAKE,

657
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,347
AND IT SHOULD
TAKE THE CAKE

658
00:33:03,347 --> 00:33:06,384
BECAUSE IT'S THE GREATEST
IDEA I EVER HEARD.

659
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,387
LET'S GET TOGETHER
AND PUT THIS THING OVER.

660
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,722
LET'S GO!

661
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,722
YEAH!

662
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,722
YEAH!

663
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,722
YEAH!

664
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:13,691
WHAT MADE ME
SAY THAT?

665
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,255
HEY! HEY, WHAT DO YOU
THINK YOU'RE DOING?

666
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,492
GO ON, GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE.

667
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:45,283
THERE. NOW,
THAT LOOKS BETTER.

668
00:35:49,981 --> 00:35:51,515
TRACY?

669
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,317
YES?

670
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:56,253
TRACY, I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU.

671
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,656
CAN'T IT WAIT?
I'M AWFUL HUNGRY.

672
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,558
I WANT TO TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

673
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:05,296
GOT THE NOTE
FROM MISS HUDSON, HUH?

674
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:06,696
SIT DOWN.

675
00:36:06,696 --> 00:36:09,098
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

676
00:36:09,099 --> 00:36:11,702
I'LL CATCH UP
ON MY HOMEWORK.

677
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,171
TRACY, SIT DOWN.

678
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:15,906
WHEN IS DINNER?

679
00:36:15,906 --> 00:36:17,275
PARK IT.

680
00:36:22,046 --> 00:36:23,513
TRACY...

681
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:29,053
HARRIET STOPPED BY
THE OFFICE TODAY,

682
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:33,924
AND SHE TOLD ME
THAT SHE SAW YOU
TALKING TO YOURSELF

683
00:36:33,924 --> 00:36:35,526
AT THE RED DRAGON,

684
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:38,161
THAT YOU WERE DOING
THE SAME THING
AT McDONALD'S.

685
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:39,463
WHAT'S GOING ON?

686
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,066
I WASN'T TALKING
TO MYSELF.

687
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:44,268
WHO WERE YOU
TALKING TO?

688
00:36:46,837 --> 00:36:48,939
WAS IT THE SAME
PERSON YOU WERE
TALKING TO

689
00:36:48,939 --> 00:36:50,774
THE OTHER NIGHT?

690
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,880
TRACY?

691
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,781
YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME.

692
00:36:57,781 --> 00:36:59,350
I WILL.

693
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:03,353
GOD.

694
00:37:03,353 --> 00:37:06,323
WHAT'S GOD
GOT TO DO WITH IT?

695
00:37:06,323 --> 00:37:09,859
HE'S THE ONE
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO.

696
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,830
OH, GOD.

697
00:37:13,897 --> 00:37:16,601
OH, GOD.

698
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,469
YOU MEAN YOU'VE
BEEN PRAYING TO GOD,

699
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:19,836
SORT OF OUT LOUD?

700
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,906
NO. HE TALKS TO ME,
AND I TALK TO HIM.

701
00:37:22,906 --> 00:37:26,509
YOU MEAN, YOU
ACTUALLY HEARD HIM?

702
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,045
SURE, I HEARD HIM.

703
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,714
HE WAS IN THE DEN.

704
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,056
YOU MEAN
YOU SAW HIM, TOO?

705
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,858
UH-HUH.

706
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,496
OH, TRACY.

707
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,365
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

708
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:50,399
YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS,
HONEY.

709
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,370
PEOPLE JUST DON'T
SEE AND CHAT WITH GOD.

710
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,272
MOM, I SAW HIM,
LOTS OF TIMES.

711
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:58,843
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME.

712
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:04,148
SHINGO,
THAT'S GREAT,
BUT I CAN'T TALK.

713
00:38:04,148 --> 00:38:06,283
I'M TRYING TO DO
MY HOMEWORK.

714
00:38:06,283 --> 00:38:07,851
HOMEWORK?
WHO'S DOING HOMEWORK?

715
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:09,986
WE'RE PRINTING,
PAINTING, AND POSTING.

716
00:38:09,986 --> 00:38:12,189
MY COUSINS ARE DOING IT
AT THEIR SCHOOL.

717
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:13,457
IT'S SPREADING.

718
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,525
THAT'S GREAT.

719
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,060
THAT'S JUST
FANTASTIC.

720
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,895
KEEP UP
THE GOOD WORK.

721
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,163
YOU CAN TAKE OVER.

722
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,531
YOU STARTED IT!

723
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:24,301
I KNOW, BUT YOU
CAN FINISH IT.
GOODBYE, SHINGO.

724
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:26,404
WAIT. TRACY, I--

725
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:34,245
OH, HI.

726
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:37,047
TRACY, YOU CAN'T QUIT.

727
00:38:37,047 --> 00:38:39,050
I JUST DID.

728
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,851
YOU'RE OFF
TO A GREAT START.

729
00:38:40,851 --> 00:38:43,820
YOU'RE DOING A SUPER JOB
FOR A GREAT CAUSE.

730
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,457
AND GETTING INTO
SUPER TROUBLE.

731
00:38:48,325 --> 00:38:50,060
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

732
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:52,763
THERE ARE SOME HEAVY
HITTERS IN THAT LINEUP.

733
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:56,100
SOCRATES,
MARTIN LUTHER KING,

734
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,002
MAHATMA GANDHI,
ABE LINCOLN.

735
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:00,337
I'M JUST A KID.

736
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:04,875
I TOLD MY MOM,
AND NOW SHE THINKS
I'M BANANAS.

737
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,810
IT NEVER FAILS.

738
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,145
SHE'S REALLY UPTIGHT
ABOUT IT.

739
00:39:09,146 --> 00:39:11,414
BANANAS. I HATE
THAT EXPRESSION.

740
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:13,484
I MAKE A BEAUTIFUL FRUIT,

741
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,352
AND PEOPLE USE IT
FOR CRAZY.

742
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,721
MY TEACHER'S
ON MY BACK, TOO.

743
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:21,425
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY,
I HAVEN'T DONE
ANY HOMEWORK.

744
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,027
LET ME SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

745
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:26,496
ABOUT A ZILLION PROBLEMS
TO MAKE UP, THAT'S ALL.

746
00:39:26,496 --> 00:39:29,734
LET ME SEE. MAYBE
I CAN HELP YOU.

747
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,306
MATHEMATICS.
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

748
00:39:36,306 --> 00:39:39,376
I SHOULD HAVE
MADE THE WHOLE
THING EASIER.

749
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,578
YOU MAKE MISTAKES?

750
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:43,647
NOBODY'S PERFECT.

751
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:46,650
I BLEW IT
WITH THE DEAD SEA.

752
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,653
ALL THAT SALT
AND NO LIFE IN IT.

753
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:51,254
AND THE FLAMINGO--

754
00:39:51,254 --> 00:39:52,522
BEAUTIFUL BIRD,

755
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:55,058
AND I PUT THE KNEECAPS
ON BACKWARDS.

756
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:57,427
AND I COULD HAVE
FOUND A BETTER WAY

757
00:39:57,427 --> 00:39:59,596
FOR A SKUNK
TO DEFEND HIMSELF.

758
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:03,066
AND YOU SURE GOOFED
WITH THE GIRAFFE.

759
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,667
GIRAFFE?

760
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:06,670
WHY'D YOU MAKE
THE NECK SO LONG?

761
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,506
SO HE COULD
EAT THE LEAVES
OFF THE TREES.

762
00:40:09,506 --> 00:40:11,908
WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE
THE TREES SHORTER?

763
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,512
WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN I NEEDED YOU?

764
00:40:15,512 --> 00:40:17,414
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

765
00:40:17,414 --> 00:40:18,949
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

766
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,750
I KNOW, IT'S AWFUL.

767
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:22,686
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,

768
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:24,822
SHE<i> WAS</i> ACTING
A LITTLE STRANGELY.

769
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:28,392
YES. SHE WAS ASKING
ME SOME QUESTIONS

770
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,560
ABOUT GOD
AND HOW I'D HANDLE

771
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,829
AN ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN
FOR HIM.

772
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,097
I DIDN'T THINK
ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

773
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:36,700
I DON'T KNOW
HOW THIS HAPPENS.

774
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,035
DO YOU SUPPOSE
SHE'S MAKING IT UP,

775
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,572
YOU KNOW, AS A PLAY
FOR ATTENTION?

776
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,106
OH, COME ON, DON.

777
00:40:43,106 --> 00:40:45,609
IF TRACY'S ONE THING,
SHE'S TRUTHFUL.

778
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,511
I DON'T THINK SHE'S
EVER TOLD A LIE.

779
00:40:52,382 --> 00:40:54,985
I'M SORRY
I WAS SO CRABBY.

780
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,386
I UNDERSTAND.

781
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,055
HERE'S
YOUR HOMEWORK.

782
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,959
WOW. THANKS.

783
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:03,993
GOD.

784
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:05,229
YEAH?

785
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:06,964
WHO DO YOU
PRAY TO?

786
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:13,437
ME? WELL, SOMETIMES
I TALK TO MYSELF.

787
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:16,038
IT MUST BE REAL
LONESOME UP THERE.

788
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,341
WELL, WHEN I SNEEZE,

789
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,977
THERE'S NO ONE AROUND
TO BLESS ME.

790
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,144
TRACY!

791
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:23,413
UH-OH,
NOW IT'S MY DAD.

792
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:25,049
I'VE GOT TO GO.

793
00:41:28,351 --> 00:41:29,953
AND BLESS YOU, GOD.

794
00:41:29,953 --> 00:41:32,256
THAT'S FOR
YOUR NEXT SNEEZE.

795
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:40,363
MAYBE I SHOULD
HAVE MADE THE TREES
A LITTLE SHORTER.

796
00:41:40,363 --> 00:41:41,498
HI, DADDY.

797
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,234
HI, SWEETHEART.

798
00:41:44,367 --> 00:41:45,902
HOW'S MY BABY?

799
00:41:45,902 --> 00:41:47,071
OK.

800
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:56,645
SO, UH...

801
00:41:56,646 --> 00:41:58,249
MOM TOLD YOU, HUH?

802
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:01,385
LOOK, UM...

803
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,320
SWEETHEART...

804
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,523
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
PEOPLE IMAGINE THINGS,

805
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:07,624
UH...

806
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,459
KIDS IN PARTICULAR.

807
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:11,127
I DIDN'T IMAGINE IT.

808
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:13,497
IT SEEMS SO REAL.

809
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,531
IT REALLY SEEMS
LIKE IT HAPPENED.

810
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:17,801
I TALKED TO HIM.
HE TALKED TO ME.

811
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:20,569
YOUR IMAGINATION
JUST RUNS RIGHT
AWAY FROM YOU.

812
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:23,540
DADDY, I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

813
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,743
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BELIEVE,

814
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,278
BUT IT HAPPENED.

815
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,948
IT HAPPENED?

816
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,549
UH...

817
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,586
LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

818
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:38,087
YOU'RE SAYING YOU
ACTUALLY SAW GOD,

819
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:40,690
I MEAN,
AS A REAL PERSON?

820
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,559
LOTS OF TIMES.

821
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,695
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HIM?

822
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:48,565
HE JUST HELPED ME
WITH MY MATH.

823
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:50,234
OH, MY GOD.

824
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,837
GOD WAS UPSTAIRS HELPING YOU
WITH YOUR HOMEWORK?

825
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:56,173
YEAH.
HERE IT IS.

826
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,110
UM...

827
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,046
WELL, THIS MULTIPLICATION
IS VERY GOOD,

828
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:07,216
BUT, TRACY, SWEETHEART,
THESE ARE YOUR NUMBERS.

829
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,452
THAT'S YOUR WRITING.

830
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,987
THAT WAS EASY
FOR HIM TO DO.

831
00:43:10,987 --> 00:43:14,258
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
IT WOULD BE.

832
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,424
UM...

833
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:17,360
RIGHT. WELL, UM...

834
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,263
OK. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS
LATER, ALL RIGHT?

835
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,732
WHY DON'T YOU, UM...

836
00:43:22,732 --> 00:43:24,601
WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK UPSTAIRS

837
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,203
AND FINISH YOUR...

838
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,806
YOUR STUDYING, OK?

839
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,351
BUT YOU BOTH THINK
I'M BANANAS.

840
00:43:42,151 --> 00:43:44,921
OH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE
SAID THAT.

841
00:43:44,921 --> 00:43:47,290
HE HATES THAT EXPRESSION.

842
00:43:57,367 --> 00:44:01,504
WHAT THE HELL
HAS BEEN GOING ON HERE
SINCE I LEFT?

843
00:44:01,504 --> 00:44:03,240
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

844
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,741
IF YOU SPENT LESS TIME

845
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:06,110
PEDDLING THOSE
OVERPRICED HOUSES,

846
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:07,644
THIS WOULDN'T HAVE
HAPPENED.

847
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,712
I'VE NEVER NEGLECTED
THAT CHILD,

848
00:44:09,712 --> 00:44:11,548
AND YOU KNOW IT.

849
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,051
I'M NOT THE ONE
WHO MOVED OUT.
YOU ARE.

850
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,819
LET'S NOT
GET INTO THAT.

851
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,320
THAT'S NOT THE PROBLEM.

852
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,223
I'LL TAKE HER
TO A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST.

853
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:21,257
NO!

854
00:44:21,257 --> 00:44:22,526
NO WAY. NEVER.

855
00:44:22,526 --> 00:44:25,261
PAULA, SHE NEEDS HELP.

856
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,664
LOOK.

857
00:44:27,864 --> 00:44:30,099
YOU TAKE CARE
OF BOOBS,

858
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:32,202
AND I WILL TAKE CARE
OF TRACY.

859
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:36,006
WE'RE NOT HERE TO ARGUE.
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

860
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,473
WHAT ABOUT A MINISTER?

861
00:44:37,473 --> 00:44:38,875
HE COULD AT LEAST--

862
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:43,379
LOOK. WHY DO WE HAVE
TO TAKE HER TO ANYBODY?

863
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:45,781
I MEAN...

864
00:44:45,782 --> 00:44:48,852
MAYBE IT'S NOT ALL
THAT BAD, YOU KNOW?

865
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,955
SHE'S OURS.
CAN'T WE...

866
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,991
CAN'T WE JUST
WORK IT OUT OURSELVES?

867
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,565
OK. GIVE IT
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

868
00:45:01,565 --> 00:45:05,535
MAYBE SHE'LL JUST
SNAP OUT OF IT.

869
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:07,203
I'LL CALL YOU.

870
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,143
GOD HELPED HER
WITH HER HOMEWORK.

871
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,846
TERRIFIC.
JUST TERRIFIC.

872
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:50,414
[BELL RINGS]

873
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:25,081
WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON AROUND HERE?

874
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,983
EVERYWHERE I LOOK,
&quot;THINK GOD.&quot;

875
00:46:26,983 --> 00:46:28,451
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS?

876
00:46:28,451 --> 00:46:30,320
OH, IT'S TRACY RICHARDS.

877
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,890
WHO'S TRACY RICHARDS?
WHAT GRADE IS SHE IN?

878
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,025
SHE'S IN
MISS HUDSON'S CLASS.

879
00:46:35,025 --> 00:46:37,827
GET HER IN HERE
AND MISS HUDSON, TOO.

880
00:46:37,827 --> 00:46:40,831
I'LL GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

881
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,501
ARE WE RUNNING
A SCHOOL OR A MONASTERY?

882
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,954
UH, NOW,
MR. AND MRS. RICHARDS,

883
00:47:04,954 --> 00:47:07,523
SINCE THIS IS
A BEHAVIOR PROBLEM,

884
00:47:07,523 --> 00:47:10,927
I'VE ASKED DR. YOUNG,
OUR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST,

885
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:13,230
TO, UH...SIT IN.

886
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,899
SHE'S A LITTLE BEHIND
IN HER HOMEWORK, BUT--

887
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:18,634
OH, IT'S WAY BEYOND THAT,
MRS. RICHARDS.

888
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:22,238
HAVE YOU SEEN ALL THOSE
&quot;THINK GOD&quot; SIGNS AROUND?

889
00:47:22,238 --> 00:47:26,442
WELL, TRACY IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE WHOLE THING.

890
00:47:26,442 --> 00:47:29,412
SHE HELD A MEETING,
GOT KIDS WORKED UP.

891
00:47:29,412 --> 00:47:32,182
NOW THEY'RE ALL
RUNNING AROUND WRITING,

892
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,716
TACKING UP SIGNS.

893
00:47:34,717 --> 00:47:36,653
WHAT, EXACTLY,
IS SO AWFUL

894
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,388
ABOUT WRITING
&quot;THINK GOD&quot;?

895
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:39,622
I MEAN--

896
00:47:39,622 --> 00:47:43,259
YEAH, I MEAN,
IF KIDS ARE GOING
TO WRITE ON WALLS,

897
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:46,263
THEY MIGHT AS WELL
WRITE SOMETHING NICE.

898
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,765
I AGREE,
BUT THE POINT IS,

899
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:52,035
RELIGION IN THE SCHOOLS
IS A VERY SENSITIVE AREA.

900
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,403
IT IS NOT ALLOWED.

901
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:56,439
SHE'S GOT THE WHOLE PLACE
IN AN UPROAR.

902
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,841
SHE'S DISRUPTED
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

903
00:47:58,841 --> 00:48:00,676
SHE'S NEVER BEEN
A TROUBLEMAKER.

904
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,613
SHE'S CERTAINLY MAKING UP
FOR IT THIS TIME.

905
00:48:03,613 --> 00:48:06,015
I HAD A TALK WITH HER.

906
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:08,917
I TOLD HER
TO CUT ALL THIS OUT.

907
00:48:08,918 --> 00:48:10,720
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T.

908
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,656
SHE COULDN'T?

909
00:48:12,656 --> 00:48:14,624
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

910
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:18,361
WOULD YOU
BRING IN TRACY, PLEASE?

911
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:22,365
IF YOU CAN'T GET HER
TO COOPERATE,

912
00:48:22,365 --> 00:48:25,935
I'LL SIMPLY HAVE TO
SUSPEND HER FROM SCHOOL.

913
00:48:30,974 --> 00:48:32,242
I'M SORRY.

914
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:35,178
TRACY, WOULD YOU
SIT DOWN, PLEASE?

915
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:42,119
YOUR PARENTS WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.

916
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,264
TRACY...

917
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:59,069
YOU REALLY
HAVE TO COOPERATE.

918
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,772
I MEAN,
MR. BENSON IS RIGHT.

919
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,441
YOU'VE DISRUPTED
THE ENTIRE SCHOOL.

920
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:08,011
WELL, UNLESS
THIS THING STOPS,

921
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:09,445
THEY'RE GOING TO
SUSPEND YOU.

922
00:49:09,445 --> 00:49:12,149
YOU DON'T WANT
THAT TO HAPPEN,
DO YOU, SWEETHEART?

923
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,589
OK, MOM.

924
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:22,492
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

925
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,595
I'LL TELL THE KIDS
TO CALL THE WHOLE THING OFF.

926
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,700
WELL, NOW,
THAT'S ALL WE ASK.

927
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,037
ALL RIGHT, TRACY. YOU CAN
GO BACK TO CLASS NOW.

928
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:36,606
THANK YOU, MR. BENSON.

929
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:37,740
BYE, MOMMY.

930
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:38,942
GOODBYE,
SWEETHEART.

931
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:40,377
SEE YOU SATURDAY,
DADDY.

932
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:41,645
BYE, BABY.

933
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:47,851
BUT BEFORE I TELL
THE KIDS TO STOP,

934
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:49,686
I HAVE TO ASK HIM.

935
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,023
ASK WHO?

936
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:56,560
ASK WHO, TRACY?

937
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:07,670
GOD.

938
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:09,606
OH, GOD.

939
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:14,411
HE'S THE ONE
WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THIS?

940
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:18,681
YEAH. IT WAS PART
HIS IDEA AND PART MINE.

941
00:50:18,681 --> 00:50:20,383
OH.

942
00:50:20,383 --> 00:50:22,452
WHEN YOU TALKED TO HIM,

943
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:24,721
DID HE TALK
TO YOU, TOO?

944
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,491
YES. HE TALKED
TO ME FIRST.

945
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,392
I SEE.

946
00:50:29,392 --> 00:50:31,294
WE TALKED
QUITE A FEW TIMES.

947
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,562
WHEN WAS THE FIRST TIME?

948
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:37,033
THE FIRST TIME
I TALKED TO HIM
OR SAW HIM?

949
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,035
YOU SAW HIM?

950
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,837
SURE.

951
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,773
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

952
00:50:43,773 --> 00:50:46,342
WELL, HE WEARS GLASSES,

953
00:50:46,342 --> 00:50:48,378
AND HE'S GOT GRAY HAIR,

954
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:51,181
AND HE'S A VERY
NICE-LOOKING MAN.

955
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:53,350
I'M SURE.

956
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:58,321
HOW DID YOU
FIRST MEET HIM?

957
00:50:59,789 --> 00:51:01,224
IN A CHINESE RESTAURANT.

958
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:05,095
HE SENT ME A MESSAGE
IN A FORTUNE COOKIE.

959
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:07,897
UH...

960
00:51:07,897 --> 00:51:09,265
TRACY, WOULD YOU, UH...

961
00:51:09,265 --> 00:51:12,669
WAIT OUT
IN THE HALL, PLEASE?

962
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:24,279
YOUR CHILD NEEDS HELP.

963
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,216
SHE IS OUT OF TOUCH
WITH REALITY.

964
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:28,817
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE.

965
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:30,887
I HAVE MY
RESPONSIBILITY.

966
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,757
I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU THIS,
MR. AND MRS. RICHARDS,

967
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:38,194
BUT, AS OF NOW,
TRACY IS SUSPENDED
FROM SCHOOL.

968
00:51:38,194 --> 00:51:39,796
FOR HOW LONG?

969
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:41,431
UNTIL SHE'S WELL.

970
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:46,002
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT,
SUSPENDING TRACY?

971
00:51:46,002 --> 00:51:49,072
SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

972
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:50,507
IF THEY'RE GOING
TO THROW HER OUT,

973
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:52,008
WHY DON'T THEY
THROW US OUT?

974
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,710
WE'VE ALL BEEN WRITING
&quot;THINK GOD.&quot;

975
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,345
WHAT WILL WE DO?

976
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,913
WE WON'T TAKE IT
LYING DOWN.

977
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:00,450
WE'LL FIGHT BACK.

978
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,357
AND ANOTHER THING,

979
00:52:07,357 --> 00:52:09,926
EVERYBODY IS TRYING
TO HELP ME.

980
00:52:09,926 --> 00:52:11,328
I DON'T NEED HELP.

981
00:52:11,328 --> 00:52:12,962
I FEEL FINE.

982
00:52:12,962 --> 00:52:14,364
I'M PERFECTLY NORMAL.

983
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,766
YOU OUGHT TO BE
PROUD OF ME.

984
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,502
NOT EVERYBODY
GETS PICKED BY GOD.

985
00:52:19,502 --> 00:52:21,770
I'M IN
A PRETTY GOOD CLUB--

986
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:25,208
SOCRATES, ABE LINCOLN,
AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT.

987
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:37,554
MR. AND MRS. RICHARDS,

988
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:40,757
THE DOCTOR WOULD LIKE
TO SEE YOU FIRST.

989
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:46,763
WE'LL BE BACK
IN A MINUTE, BABY.

990
00:52:54,637 --> 00:52:57,073
HIYA, TRACY.

991
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,473
OH, HELLO.

992
00:52:58,474 --> 00:53:01,243
I WAS WONDERING
WHEN YOU WERE
GOING TO SHOW UP.

993
00:53:01,243 --> 00:53:02,612
EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL,

994
00:53:02,612 --> 00:53:05,348
AND NOW YOU'RE A LITTLE
UPSET ABOUT THIS?

995
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,483
NO. I'M FINE.

996
00:53:07,483 --> 00:53:10,553
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE
A LITTLE UPSET.

997
00:53:10,553 --> 00:53:13,557
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
A LOT TO DO,

998
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:16,625
BUT YOU WOULDN'T FORGET
ABOUT ME, WOULD YOU?

999
00:53:16,625 --> 00:53:19,829
WELL, YOU ARE
A LITTLE WORRIED,
AREN'T YOU?

1000
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:22,098
I GUESS I AM.

1001
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:23,333
LET ME...

1002
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,601
LET ME TELL YOU
A LITTLE STORY.

1003
00:53:25,601 --> 00:53:28,537
THERE WAS THIS TIGER
IN THE JUNGLE,

1004
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:31,073
AND HE GOT A THORN
IN HIS PAW.

1005
00:53:31,073 --> 00:53:32,375
IT WAS VERY PAINFUL.

1006
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,811
THIS LITTLE CAT
SAW THIS

1007
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:37,514
AND PULLED THE THORN
OUT OF HIS PAW.

1008
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,016
THIS MADE THE TIGER
VERY HAPPY.

1009
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:43,119
THE CAT SAYS, &quot;I'VE
DONE YOU A FAVOR.

1010
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,353
YOU DO ME ONE.&quot;

1011
00:53:44,353 --> 00:53:46,155
THE TIGER SAYS,
&quot;ANYTHING.&quot;

1012
00:53:46,155 --> 00:53:48,691
THE CAT SAYS,
&quot;WHENEVER I'M
IN THE JUNGLE,

1013
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:50,792
I'M SCARED
OF THE ANIMALS.&quot;

1014
00:53:50,793 --> 00:53:53,229
THE TIGER SAYS,
&quot;NO PROBLEM.

1015
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:55,497
&quot;WHEN YOU WALK
THROUGH THE JUNGLE,

1016
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,766
&quot;HOLD YOUR HEAD UP,

1017
00:53:56,766 --> 00:53:58,634
&quot;SHAKE IT,
WAG YOUR TAIL,

1018
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:01,304
AND THEY'LL THINK
YOU'RE A TIGER.&quot;

1019
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:05,341
THE LITTLE CAT
GOT AWAY WITH IT
FOR THREE YEARS.

1020
00:54:05,341 --> 00:54:08,911
ONE DAY SHE MET
THE TIGER.

1021
00:54:08,911 --> 00:54:11,914
SHE WAS
SHAKING HER HEAD,
WAGGING HER TAIL.

1022
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:16,086
THE TIGER SAYS,
&quot;YOU DON'T HAVE TO
SHAKE AND WAG AT ME.

1023
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,854
I KNOW
YOU'RE A CAT.&quot;

1024
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:23,693
THAT'S IT?

1025
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:25,094
THAT'S IT.

1026
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:27,330
WHAT'S THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH ME?

1027
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,199
NOTHING.
IT'S A CUTE STORY.

1028
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:32,335
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
CHEER YOU UP.

1029
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,940
THAT'S BETTER.

1030
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,642
YOU'VE BEEN SEPARATED
SEVEN MONTHS, RIGHT?

1031
00:54:39,642 --> 00:54:41,009
YES.

1032
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:42,778
FROM WHAT YOU'VE SAID,

1033
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:45,314
TRACY'S CONTACTS
WITH GOD

1034
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:48,084
USUALLY TAKE PLACE
IN EATING AREAS.

1035
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:49,451
THE CHINESE RESTAURANT,

1036
00:54:49,451 --> 00:54:51,754
McDONALD'S,
AN ICE CREAM CART.

1037
00:54:51,754 --> 00:54:55,124
THEY'VE ALL TAKEN PLACE
SINCE YOU, MR. RICHARDS,

1038
00:54:55,124 --> 00:54:58,127
LEFT THE HOUSE
FOLLOWING YOUR SEPARATION.

1039
00:54:58,127 --> 00:55:00,797
SO, OBVIOUSLY,

1040
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:04,300
TRACY HAS CREATED
A FANTASY FATHER FIGURE

1041
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,602
AS A SUBSTITUTE

1042
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,569
TO GIVE HER
THE EMOTIONAL NURTURING

1043
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:10,306
SHE CRAVES
FROM HER MISSING FATHER.

1044
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,607
ARE YOU SURE?

1045
00:55:11,607 --> 00:55:14,043
ONE IS NEVER
COMPLETELY SURE,

1046
00:55:14,043 --> 00:55:16,179
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE
YOU SAID

1047
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:17,813
THAT'S VERY INTRIGUING.

1048
00:55:17,813 --> 00:55:20,816
TRACY'S FANTASY FATHER,
GOD,

1049
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:23,886
LIKE HER REAL FATHER,
IS INTERESTED IN ADVERTISING

1050
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,923
OR SPREADING A MESSAGE,

WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

1229
01:08:33,408 --> 01:08:36,344
I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER
FOR YOU.

1230
01:08:36,344 --> 01:08:39,248
TRACY,
I'M A VERY BUSY MAN.

1231
01:08:39,247 --> 01:08:42,651
MY PHONE
NEVER STOPS RINGING.

1232
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:46,321
RUNNING AWAY--
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU.

1233
01:08:46,321 --> 01:08:47,923
I WAS SCARED.

1234
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:51,460
I DIDN'T WANT
TO GO INTO THAT
DUMB INSTITUTION.

1235
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:53,729
IT ALL SEEMED
SO HOPELESS.

1236
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:55,865
SO YOU PANICKED.

1237
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:58,600
ALL I WAS DOING
WAS CAUSING TROUBLE.

1238
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,202
MY PARENTS WERE
SO WORRIED ABOUT ME.

1239
01:09:01,203 --> 01:09:03,305
NOW THEY'RE
EVEN MORE WORRIED.

1240
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,075
I GUESS RUNNING AWAY
ISN'T THE ANSWER.

1241
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:07,443
NEVER WAS.

1242
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:09,778
WHEN YOU KNOW
YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU HANG IN THERE.

1243
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:12,847
GUESS I'M NOT A MEMBER
OF THE CLUB ANYMORE.

1244
01:09:12,846 --> 01:09:16,550
NO, NO. THE BEST OF THEM
HAD THEIR WEAK MOMENTS.

1245
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:18,954
THEY ALL STRUCK OUT
A FEW TIMES.

1246
01:09:18,953 --> 01:09:21,121
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

1247
01:09:21,122 --> 01:09:24,260
TRACY,
I'M TAKING YOU HOME.

1248
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:27,496
I WANT YOU TO.

1249
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,465
YOU FEEL BETTER
NOW?

1250
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:30,999
YEAH.

1251
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:33,068
CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

1252
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:34,336
GO AHEAD.

1253
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:37,373
WHY DO YOU LET
BAD THINGS HAPPEN?

1254
01:09:37,372 --> 01:09:40,643
YOU ASK
VERY GOOD QUESTIONS.

1255
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,310
YOU KNOW, TRACY,

1256
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:44,245
THINGS THAT YOU
MIGHT THINK ARE BAD

1257
01:09:44,245 --> 01:09:45,647
ARE NOT ALWAYS BAD.

1258
01:09:45,647 --> 01:09:48,416
SOMETIMES
THERE'S A PURPOSE
YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF.

1259
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:49,951
BUT WHAT ABOUT
SICKNESS?

1260
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,955
WHAT ABOUT
KIDS MY AGE WHO
GET SICK AND DIE?

1261
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:55,357
THOSE ARE REALLY
BAD THINGS,
AREN'T THEY?

1262
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,259
THOSE ARE BAD THINGS.

1263
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:59,194
YES, PAIN
AND SUFFERING--

1264
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:01,196
THAT'S A HARD ONE
TO EXPLAIN.

1265
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:03,031
I'LL BET.

1266
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,867
THIS SOUNDS
LIKE A COPOUT,

1267
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,636
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN REALLY DO
ABOUT IT.

1268
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:09,538
IT'S BUILT
INTO THE SYSTEM.

1269
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,972
WHICH YOU INVENTED.

1270
01:10:10,972 --> 01:10:15,110
I NEVER COULD
FIGURE OUT HOW
TO MAKE ANYTHING

1271
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:16,344
WITH JUST
ONE SIDE TO IT.

1272
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,612
ONE SIDE?

1273
01:10:17,612 --> 01:10:20,883
YOU EVER SEE A FRONT
WITHOUT A BACK?

1274
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,217
A TOP WITHOUT
A BOTTOM?

1275
01:10:22,217 --> 01:10:23,218
NO.

1276
01:10:23,218 --> 01:10:24,553
UP WITHOUT DOWN?

1277
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,554
NO.

1278
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:28,957
OK. AND THERE CAN'T BE
GOOD WITHOUT BAD,

1279
01:10:28,957 --> 01:10:31,192
LIFE WITHOUT DEATH,

1280
01:10:31,192 --> 01:10:32,728
PLEASURE
WITHOUT PAIN.

1281
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,296
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

1282
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:37,566
IF I TAKE SAD AWAY,
HAPPY GOES WITH IT.

1283
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:39,701
IF ANYONE KNOWS
ANOTHER WAY,

1284
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:42,504
I WISH THEY'D PUT IT
IN THE SUGGESTION BOX.

1285
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:45,441
I GUESS SOMEDAY
I'LL UNDERSTAND.

1286
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,742
YOU DO,
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST.

1287
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:49,978
SOME THINGS
CAN'T BE GRASPED.

1288
01:10:49,978 --> 01:10:51,346
WHAT'S THE END?

1289
01:10:51,346 --> 01:10:52,981
THE END OF TIME?

1290
01:10:52,981 --> 01:10:54,782
THE END
OF THE UNIVERSE?

1291
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:56,785

01:10:59,321 --> 01:11:00,455
I LIKE THAT.

1294
01:11:00,455 --> 01:11:02,557
GOOD.
LET'S GET GOING.

YOU'LL BE
IN YOUR OWN BED.

THAT WORKS FOR ME.

1299
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:16,805
FOR YOU, I'LL HAVE TO
DO IT THE HARD WAY.

1300
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:19,240

01:18:42,984 --> 01:18:44,252
IT'S
MY RESPONSIBILITY

1401
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:47,188
TO GET THE CHILDREN
BACK INTO CLASS.

1402
01:18:47,188 --> 01:18:49,991
I WANT A COURT ORDER
TO FORCE DR. NEWELL

1403
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,793
TO RELEASE
TRACY RICHARDS.

1404
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:53,995
SUPERINTENDENT HODGES
IS WRONG, YOUR HONOR.

1405
01:18:53,995 --> 01:18:55,897
SHE DOESN'T BELONG
IN SCHOOL.

1406
01:18:55,897 --> 01:18:57,332
SHE'S SUFFERING
FROM DELUSIONS.

1407
01:18:57,332 --> 01:19:01,136
SHE BELONGS WHERE
SHE CAN GET CARE
AND TREATMENT.

1408
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:04,206
CHILDREN IMAGINE...
LOTS OF THINGS.

1409
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:06,875
OUR WHOLE SCHOOL SYSTEM
IS PARALYZED

1410
01:19:06,875 --> 01:19:09,411
BECAUSE OF THE PERSONAL
OPINION OF ONE MAN.

1411
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,079
EXCUSE ME, BUT
I DON'T INTEND TO RELY

1412
01:19:12,079 --> 01:19:15,215
ON THE PERSONAL OPINION
OF ONE MAN, SIR.

1413
01:19:15,216 --> 01:19:19,020
NOW, BEFORE I ISSUE
A COURT ORDER, DR. NEWELL,

1414
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,321
DO SOMETHING FOR ME.

1415
01:19:20,321 --> 01:19:23,391
I'D LIKE YOU
TO CONVENE A PANEL

1416
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,693
OF TOP PSYCHIATRISTS
IN THIS CITY

1417
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,361
AND HAVE THEM
THOROUGHLY EXAMINE

1418
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:30,398
THIS POOR LITTLE GIRL--
TRACY RICHARDS, IS IT?

1419
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:31,666
TRACY RICHARDS.

1420
01:19:31,666 --> 01:19:35,069
AND THEN, WHEN THEY'VE
MADE THEIR CONCLUSIONS...

1421
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:37,906
I'LL MAKE MY DECISION.

1422
01:19:49,884 --> 01:19:52,187
YES, I MET HIM
IN MY DAD'S CAR.

1423
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,255
HE CAME THROUGH
THE TELEVISION SET.

1424
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:57,458
HE GAVE ME ICE CREAM--
CHERRY JUBILEE,

1425
01:19:57,458 --> 01:19:58,860
WE ATE AT McDONALD'S,

1426
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,228
AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN--

1427
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:03,498
HE BROUGHT ME HOME
ON HIS MOTORCYCLE.

1428
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:08,269
DR. WHITLEY,
THERE'S ONE QUESTION
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK.

1429
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:11,639
I THINK THERE HAVE BEEN
ENOUGH QUESTIONS.

1430
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:13,541
MR. AND MRS. RICHARDS,

1431
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:17,646
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO ADD?

1432
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:20,648
WELL, UH...
WHAT CAN WE SAY?

1433
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:23,117
NO, UH...

1434
01:20:23,117 --> 01:20:26,354
WE'D LIKE TO DO
WHATEVER'S BEST
FOR TRACY.

1435
01:20:26,354 --> 01:20:29,891
WOULD YOU THREE
MIND STEPPING INTO
THE WAITING ROOM?

1436
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:31,259
UH, CARL...

1437
01:20:47,675 --> 01:20:50,011
WELL, IT'S
VERY EVIDENT

1438
01:20:50,011 --> 01:20:51,646
WHAT WE'RE DEALING
WITH HERE.

1439
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:53,114
I MIGHT ADD, DR. NEWELL,

1440
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,517
YOU'VE DONE
YOUR USUAL THOROUGH JOB.

1441
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,851
THANK YOU.

1442
01:20:56,851 --> 01:20:59,186
MAY I BRING UP A POINT?

1443
01:20:59,186 --> 01:21:00,522
I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU

1444
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,891
THAT THERE'S A GREAT
DEAL OF SYMPATHY

1445
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:05,093
FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL.

1446
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,561
MANY CHILDREN
ARE OUT OF SCHOOL.

1447
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:09,998
OUR PROFESSION WILL BE
UNDER TREMENDOUS PRESSURE.

1448
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,599
WE CAN'T
GIVE IN TO THAT.

1449
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,935
NO, WE CAN'T
GIVE IN TO THAT.

1450
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,469
NO, WE--WE CAN'T.

1451
01:21:15,469 --> 01:21:18,840
IF WE LET HER
RUN AROUND
WITH HER DELUSIONS,

1452
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,275
WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THE PATIENT

1453
01:21:21,275 --> 01:21:23,411
WHO THINKS
HE'S NAPOLEON?

1454
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:26,114
CERTAINLY.
IF SHE'S RIGHT,

1455
01:21:26,114 --> 01:21:29,384
THEN, UH...
WE'RE ALL WRONG.

1456
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:33,888
NO, THE GIRL BELONGS
IN AN INSTITUTION.

1457
01:21:33,888 --> 01:21:36,023
NOW, ARE THERE
ANY OBJECTIONS?

1458
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:37,458
NO? THEN THAT'S
SETTLED.

1459
01:21:37,458 --> 01:21:40,562
CARL, WOULD YOU BRING
THEM BACK IN, PLEASE?

1460
01:21:45,366 --> 01:21:47,035
THEY'RE READY.

1461
01:22:04,018 --> 01:22:06,054
NOW, TRACY...

1462
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:10,058
WE'VE ALL DECIDED
THAT, UH, YOU NEED HELP...

1463
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:14,195
AND, BELIEVE ME, IT'S
IN YOUR BEST INTEREST.

1464
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:15,429
AND THE CHANCES ARE

1465
01:22:15,429 --> 01:22:18,400
THAT YOU WON'T BE
THERE FOR LONG.

1466
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:21,635
IF YOU LOOK AT IT
IN A POSITIVE WAY,

1467
01:22:21,636 --> 01:22:24,039
I'M SURE THAT YOU--

1468
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:29,311
It's him.
It's God.

1469
01:22:30,911 --> 01:22:33,114
SORRY I'M LATE.

1470
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:40,121
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO
MY DISTINGUISHED COLLEAGUES.

1471
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:41,489
I WOULD'VE BEEN
HERE SOONER,

1472
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:43,424
BUT I WAS STUCK
IN TRAFFIC.

1473
01:22:43,425 --> 01:22:44,659
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

1474
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,827
WHO ARE YOU?

1475
01:22:46,828 --> 01:22:48,229
DR. STEVENS.

1476
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:51,366
I DON'T RECALL
YOUR BEING INVITED.

1477
01:22:51,366 --> 01:22:52,600
IF I WAITED
TO BE INVITED,

1478
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:54,335
I'D MISS A LOT
OF IMPORTANT THINGS.

1479
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:55,903
HOWEVER,
IN THIS CASE,

1480
01:22:55,903 --> 01:22:57,238
I THINK
YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

1481
01:22:57,238 --> 01:23:01,276
BUT YOUR NAME'S
NOT ON THE LIST.
YES, IT IS.

1482
01:23:05,179 --> 01:23:06,381
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

1483
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,882
WE'RE ALL
LEARNED PSYCHIATRISTS.

1484
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:11,818
WHAT DID THIS LITTLE GIRL DO
THAT WAS SO TERRIBLE?

1485
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:13,254
SHE GOT CHILDREN TOGETHER.

1486
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:15,222
THEY ALL WROTE
&quot;THINK GOD,&quot;

1487
01:23:15,222 --> 01:23:17,291
AND THE WORLD
IS THINKING GOD.

1488
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:18,960
IS THAT SO BAD?

1489
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:23,664
BUT, SIR, AS A...
LEARNED PSYCHIATRIST,

1490
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:26,166
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
THAT THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

1491
01:23:26,166 --> 01:23:27,935
THIS LITTLE GIRL
CLAIMS

1492
01:23:27,935 --> 01:23:31,106
SHE NOT ONLY SAW GOD
AND SPOKE TO HIM,

1493
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:34,208
BUT HE SPOKE
TO HER AS WELL.

1494
01:23:34,208 --> 01:23:36,978
WHO ARE WE TO SAY
THAT SHE DIDN'T?

1495
01:23:36,978 --> 01:23:39,080
MAYBE SHE DID.

1496
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,115
MAYBE SHE DIDN'T.

1497
01:23:41,115 --> 01:23:43,084
LOOK, SIR,
WE'VE ALL VOTED.

1498
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,885
I KNOW, AND YOU SAID
IF SHE'S RIGHT

1499
01:23:45,886 --> 01:23:48,623
THEN WE'RE ALL WRONG.

1500
01:23:48,623 --> 01:23:50,090
WELL...

1501
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:53,027
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I SAID THAT?

1502
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:55,329
I ALSO READ
TEA LEAVES.

1503
01:23:55,329 --> 01:23:59,433
LOOK, I MEAN,
WE ARE COMPETENT
PROFESSIONALS.

1504
01:23:59,433 --> 01:24:01,069
WE KNOW
OUR BUSINESS.

1505
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:03,537
WE'VE BEEN OVER
THIS CASE BACKWARDS
AND FORWARDS,

1506
01:24:03,537 --> 01:24:06,640
AND WE HAVE MADE
OUR DECISION.

1507
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:10,211
I WOULDN'T WANT THIS
TO GET AROUND,

1508
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:12,380
BUT, IF WE'RE
SO COMPETENT,

1509
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,782
SO RIGHT IN ALL
OUR METHODS AND THEORIES,

1510
01:24:14,782 --> 01:24:17,919
HOW IS IT SO MANY PEOPLE
IN INSTITUTIONS

1511
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:19,320
NEVER GET OUT?

1512
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:22,624
BUT THAT'S A SITUATION
BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

1513
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:25,559
MANY PEOPLE WILL NEVER
BE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH

1514
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,728
BETWEEN REALITY
AND ILLUSION.

1515
01:24:27,728 --> 01:24:30,398
REMEMBER, SOMETIMES
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

1516
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:32,867
TO DETERMINE WHAT IS REALITY
AND WHAT IS ILLUSION.

1517
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:35,703
FOR INSTANCE,
THE, UH, THE CHANDELIER--

1518
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:38,806
NOW, THAT'S REALITY.

1519
01:24:38,806 --> 01:24:40,074
WE ALL LOOKED UP,

1520
01:24:40,074 --> 01:24:41,209
WE ALL SAW IT.

1521
01:24:41,209 --> 01:24:43,077
WE ALL KNOW IT'S THERE.

1522
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:44,746
BUT IS IT?

1523
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,817

1524
01:24:47,348 --> 01:24:48,817

1525
01:24:52,786 --> 01:24:56,090
OH, MY GOD...

1526
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:57,892
IT IS GOD.

1527
01:24:57,892 --> 01:25:01,496
WHAT'S THE ILLUSION,
AND WHAT'S THE REALITY?

1528
01:25:01,496 --> 01:25:04,164
DID THE CHANDELIER
DISAPPEAR OR NOT?

1529
01:25:04,164 --> 01:25:06,300
WE'RE ALL
INTELLIGENT PEOPLE.

1530
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,236
DID WE SEE IT,
OR DIDN'T WE SEE IT?

1531
01:25:09,236 --> 01:25:10,437
MAYBE THAT LITTLE GIRL

1532
01:25:10,437 --> 01:25:13,441
DID SEE AND TALK WITH GOD.

1533
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:16,111
WHERE IS IT WRITTEN
THAT MOSES HAD AN EXCLUSIVE?

1534
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,147
JUST BECAUSE
WE HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO GOD

1535
01:25:19,147 --> 01:25:20,915
DOESN'T MEAN SHE HASN'T.

1536
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:25,019
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON
OR WHO YOU ARE--

1537
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:27,654
MAYBE A MAGICIAN
OR A HYPNOTIST--

1538
01:25:27,654 --> 01:25:30,724
BUT THERE ARE SOME
THINGS I'M SURE OF.

1539
01:25:30,724 --> 01:25:33,494
I KNOW THAT WE'RE ALL
PSYCHIATRISTS HERE.

1540
01:25:33,494 --> 01:25:35,797
I KNOW I'M
BENJAMIN CHARLES WHITLEY.

1541
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,432
I HAVE FOUR CHILDREN.

1542
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:40,134
I PAY $2,200 A MONTH
ALIMONY.

1543
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:42,536
I KNOW THIS IS
THE UCLA
MEDICAL CENTER,

1544
01:25:42,536 --> 01:25:45,873
AND I KNOW IT IS
11:30 IN THE MORNING.

1545
01:25:45,873 --> 01:25:47,541
DOCTOR...

1546
01:25:47,542 --> 01:25:49,410
ARE YOU SURE
IT'S MORNING?

1547
01:25:49,410 --> 01:25:51,212

1549
01:26:01,221 --> 01:26:02,656
DOCTOR, YOU'RE RIGHT.

1550
01:26:02,656 --> 01:26:05,193
IT IS 11:30
IN THE MORNING.

1551
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:19,307
I KNOW WE'RE ALL
ANXIOUS TO GET HOME,

1552
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:21,375
BUT BEFORE
WE JUDGE TRACY,

1553
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,810
SHOULDN'T WE ALL

1554
01:26:22,810 --> 01:26:25,146
BE A LITTLE MORE SURE
OF OURSELVES?

1555
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:27,880
IF WE TOLD EVERYBODY
THAT WE SAW

1556
01:26:27,881 --> 01:26:30,418
DAY TURN INTO NIGHT
AND NIGHT INTO DAY,

1557
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:32,587
THEY'D THROW US
OUT OF SCHOOL, TOO.

1558
01:26:32,587 --> 01:26:36,224
SO MAYBE TRACY
DID SEE GOD.

1559
01:26:39,326 --> 01:26:42,463
MAYBE YOU'RE SEEING HIM
RIGHT NOW.

1560
01:26:42,463 --> 01:26:44,599
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT.

1561
01:26:53,941 --> 01:26:56,143
THINK ABOUT IT.

1562
01:26:56,143 --> 01:26:58,346
GIVE IT
SOME THOUGHT.

WE'RE GOING TO
TAKE TRACY HOME NOW.

WE'VE GOT TO GET HER
READY FOR SCHOOL
IN THE MORNING.

1569
01:27:31,445 --> 01:27:33,880
COME ON, BABY.

1570
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:51,265
AHEM.

1571
01:27:51,265 --> 01:27:53,367
I, UH...

1572
01:27:53,367 --> 01:27:56,637
I DON'T KNOW, UH,
WHETHER ANY OF US HERE

1573
01:27:56,637 --> 01:27:58,572
UNDERSTAND WHAT, UH...

1574
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,209
WHAT--WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED HERE,

1575
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,778
BUT I'M
INCLINED TO THINK

1576
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:07,515
THAT IT MIGHT BE
A VERY GOOD IDEA

1577
01:28:07,515 --> 01:28:10,151
IF WE KEEP IT
TO OURSELVES.

1578
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,385
YEAH.

1579
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,385
YEAH.

1580
01:28:10,151 --> 01:28:12,385
YEAH.

1581
01:28:12,386 --> 01:28:14,822
VERY WELL, THEN...

1582
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:18,059
THE CASE OF TRACY RICHARDS
IS CLOSED.

1583
01:28:19,327 --> 01:28:21,028
THANK GOD.

1584
01:28:21,028 --> 01:28:23,364
YOU'RE WELCOME.

1585
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:30,438
TO THE THREE OF US.

1586
01:28:34,608 --> 01:28:37,177
HOW ABOUT
A LITTLE KISS, HUH?

1587
01:28:37,177 --> 01:28:38,411
THANK YOU.

1588
01:28:38,412 --> 01:28:39,914
HOW ABOUT ONE
OVER HERE?

1589
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:41,983
WITH PLEASURE.

1590
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:50,925
RECONCILIATIONS
ARE MORE FUN
THAN WEDDINGS.

1591
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:04,839
EXCUSE ME.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1592
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,340
WHERE YOU GOING?

1593
01:29:06,340 --> 01:29:08,942
JUST TO THE LOUNGE
FOR A SECOND.

1594
01:29:08,942 --> 01:29:10,010
AH.

1595
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:11,345
DON'T BE TOO LONG.

1596
01:29:11,345 --> 01:29:13,213
YOUR EGG FOO YUNG
WILL GET COLD.

1597
01:29:13,213 --> 01:29:15,383
OK.

1598
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,821
COME IN, TRACY.

1599
01:29:21,154 --> 01:29:25,893
I WAS WAITING
FOR THE DOOR TO OPEN
BY ITSELF.

1600
01:29:25,893 --> 01:29:28,262
SORRY. I FORGOT.

1601
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:31,965
YOU SEE, TRACY,
EVERYTHING WORKED OUT.

1602
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:33,434
IT SURE DID.

1603
01:29:33,434 --> 01:29:36,370
IT'S NEAT THE WAY
YOU GOT MY PARENTS
TOGETHER AGAIN.

1604
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:39,907
NO, NO. THEY DID THAT
BY THEMSELVES.

1605
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:43,244
AW, I BET
YOU ARRANGED
THE WHOLE THING.

1606
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,212
HONEST TO ME,
I DIDN'T.

1607
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:48,916
TRACY, THE REASON
I CALLED YOU--

1608
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:51,452
I WANT TO THANK YOU
AND ALL THE CHILDREN

1609
01:29:51,452 --> 01:29:53,487
FOR THE WONDERFUL JOB
YOU DID.

1610
01:29:53,487 --> 01:29:56,457
WILL I EVER
SEE YOU AGAIN?

1611
01:29:56,457 --> 01:29:59,460
IF I EVER HAVE
A REAL BIG PROBLEM,

1612
01:29:59,460 --> 01:30:02,029
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST ONE
I'LL CALL.

1613
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:04,832
YOU WON'T NEED ME.
YOU'RE GOD.

1614
01:30:04,832 --> 01:30:07,401
YOU DON'T NEED
ANYBODY.

1615
01:30:07,401 --> 01:30:09,370
GOD NEEDS EVERYONE.

1616
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:11,873
I NEED ALL THE HELP
I CAN GET.

1617
01:30:19,146 --> 01:30:21,682
GOODBYE, TRACY.

1618
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:25,953
GO AHEAD, TRACY.

1619
01:30:25,953 --> 01:30:29,824
THERE'S NOTHING WORSE
THAN COLD EGG FOO YUNG.
