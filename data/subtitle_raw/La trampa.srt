THE TRAP

2
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:21,225
Based on Anthony Gilbert's
"Mystery in the Woodshed"

3
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:10,358
Directed by
Carlos Hugo Christensen

4
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:28,787
<i>It's 3 P.M. in Buenos Aires.</i>

5
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:32,628
<i>The huge concrete jungle quivers...</i>

6
00:01:32,753 --> 00:01:35,753
<i>with the intensity of
some amazing beehive.</i>

7
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:43,234
<i>Paulina Figueroa was the victim
of a selfish and dominant father.</i>

8
00:01:44,257 --> 00:01:48,242
<i>Her teenage dreams
fled before her brooding eyes...</i>

9
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:53,036
<i>like some beautiful scenery
flashing from a train window.</i>

10
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,539
<i>An unrelenting inferiority complex...</i>

11
00:01:57,026 --> 00:02:00,386
<i>finally withered what
was left of her youth.</i>

12
00:02:01,835 --> 00:02:07,151
<i>When she turned 25, Paulina Figueroa
felt that her heart had become old...</i>

13
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:10,318
<i>and she had given up all
hope of ever finding love.</i>

14
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:14,445
<i>When her father died,
she left her provincial property.</i>

15
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,962
<i>She arrived at the big city
and became one of those silent beings...</i>

16
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,827
<i>that gloomily gaze at
other people's happiness.</i>

17
00:02:25,356 --> 00:02:30,080
<i>A happiness so overwhelming
to those that feel lonely.</i>

18
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,518
<i>Four cardinal points
determined her life direction:</i>

19
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:37,767
<i>Her yearly income, her apartment,</i>

20
00:02:37,792 --> 00:02:42,142
<i>cinema - which awoke
unknown feelings in her -</i>

21
00:02:42,177 --> 00:02:47,018
<i>and lastly, the most exciting adventure
of her thwarted youth.</i>

22
00:02:47,053 --> 00:02:48,867
FEMALE MORAL SOCIETY

23
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:54,963
Dear members, let us strengthen
women's social emancipation...

24
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:59,214
but let us also mercilessly fight
against the false moral emancipation...

25
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:02,631
that has corrupted
the purest of virtues.

26
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:12,636
Thank you so much,
my dearest fellow members.

27
00:03:12,661 --> 00:03:17,645
In our next meeting we shall form a
committee, presided by a secretary,

28
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,431
who will develop
a strategy for our campaign,

29
00:03:20,456 --> 00:03:22,856
the initial object of which shall be...

30
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:25,756
to do battle against
the shameless exhibition...

31
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:30,265
of women's intimate
garments in window shops.

32
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,561
What about male garments?

33
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:40,170
We'll discuss that
when the time comes.

34
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:45,143
Miss Figueroa, please don't leave
the premises. I need to talk to you.

35
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:48,549
The meeting is over.

36
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:53,817
I have a hunch she wants
to name you Secretary.

37
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:58,554
No. I'm too insignificant
for such an important task.

38
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:10,142
Have you decided on a film?

39
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,446
How about the Opera theater?
They're showing "Arch of Triumph".

40
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:15,280
From what I've heard it's fantastic.

41
00:04:15,305 --> 00:04:18,420
Ingrid Bergman marries Boyer,
whom she meets in the train.

42
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:23,400
And after a passionate romance,
she winds up in pieces by the chimney.

43
00:04:23,425 --> 00:04:24,839
Isn't that awesome?

44
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:29,278
How very American.
That doesn't happen in real life.

45
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,803
Do you think not?

46
00:04:31,863 --> 00:04:35,190
Sometimes fantasy
doesn't dare become as strange...

47
00:04:35,715 --> 00:04:36,857
...as reality.

48
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:40,640
See you later then.
Five o'clock at the Richmond tea house?

49
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:41,995
See you later.

50
00:04:47,929 --> 00:04:49,272
READING ROOM

51
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:53,580
<i>Thus began Paulina Figueroa's
peculiar adventure.</i>

52
00:04:54,715 --> 00:05:00,143
<i>She'd bide her time, chastely surrounded
by her romantic novel collection,</i>

53
00:05:00,168 --> 00:05:02,998
<i>when she randomly opened
an evening newspaper.</i>

54
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:16,963
GENTLEMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE, single,
would like to meet a formal lady,

55
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:22,249
with the intent of marriage. Preferably
a lady who enjoys the quiet life...

56
00:05:22,374 --> 00:05:27,281
in the country. Own fortune. No
relatives a must. P.O. Box # 75, Tigre.

57
00:05:36,443 --> 00:05:40,392
<i>A strange emotion
shook Paulina Figueroa.</i>

58
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:44,748
<i>What did that ad mean? Was it a joke?</i>

59
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:49,029
<i>Impossible. She'd be the last
to make fun out of someone's loneliness.</i>

60
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,584
<i>But what kind of woman
answers such a peculiar ad?</i>

61
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:58,475
<i>Would a straightforward
man place an ad looking for a wife?</i>

62
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,106
<i>What would he be like? Old, perhaps?</i>

63
00:06:03,676 --> 00:06:05,579
<i>Or simply a vulgar man.</i>

64
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,402
<i>And why not a man full of vices?
A sick man?</i>

65
00:06:12,627 --> 00:06:14,015
Excuse me, ma'am.

66
00:06:19,774 --> 00:06:23,044
<i>A rare feeling of hope enveloped her.</i>

67
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:27,344
<i>Yes, there was no doubt
there were good men about.</i>

68
00:06:27,369 --> 00:06:30,304
<i>Lonely and shy like her.</i>

69
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:36,751
<i>They get far away calls from life,
and even get bled little by little.</i>

70
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:52,074
<i>Dear sir, I've read your ad
and since I'm also a lonely person,</i>

71
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:56,410
<i>I can readily understand that someone
can be obliged by circumstances...</i>

72
00:06:56,435 --> 00:07:00,410
<i>to choose a partner
in such an... unusual way.</i>

73
00:07:01,194 --> 00:07:04,393
<i>And thus I'm writing
to request more details.</i>

74
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:08,137
<i>My name is Paulina Figueroa.</i>

75
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:12,619
<i>I'm single and well off.</i>

76
00:07:13,282 --> 00:07:15,996
<i>I'm experienced with domestic chores.</i>

77
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:21,459
<i>I love the quiet life and have spent
most of my youth in the country.</i>

78
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:25,511
<i>As you'll notice,
our tastes are similar.</i>

79
00:07:26,224 --> 00:07:32,039
<i>Naturally, if you were to be interested
we'd both need more information.</i>

80
00:07:32,064 --> 00:07:35,970
<i>But if I've made a mistake
and your ad is only in jest,</i>

81
00:07:36,562 --> 00:07:39,699
<i>please forget about this letter.</i>

82
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,590
<i>Paulina thought that her letter was
more like a housekeeper seeking a job.</i>

83
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:55,851
<i>But finally decided that
this wasn't so important.</i>

84
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:10,424
...I'm worth 450,000 pesos...

85
00:08:43,613 --> 00:08:46,896
<i>I'm still interested,
and circumstances haven't changed.</i>

86
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,327
<i>Can I request an answer by telegram?</i>

87
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:54,644
<i>Madam, my island is a lonely place.</i>

88
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,077
<i>But it is lovely.</i>

89
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,761
<i>And with a speed boat there's
no reason to feel isolated.</i>

90
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:04,855
<i>Could this be the paradise
you yearn for in your best dreams?</i>

91
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,380
<i>Yours sincerely, Hugo Morán</i>

92
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:13,029
ARRIVING TUESDAY ON SPECIFIED TRAIN
AFFECTIONALLY PAULINA FIGUEROA

93
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:05,835
Paulina Figueroa? I'm Hugo Morán.

94
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:07,943
I'm very pleased to meet you.

95
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:12,116
I was afraid you'd changed you mind.

96
00:11:12,901 --> 00:11:15,255
It's not easy coming to meet a stranger.

97
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,999
Good afternoon, Mr. Morán!

98
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:24,322
So your wife is finally here!

99
00:11:24,474 --> 00:11:25,865
How are you, Mrs. Morán?

100
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:29,529
You took so long we had started
to believe you were a ghost.

101
00:11:30,116 --> 00:11:34,180
Speaking of ghosts, I suppose you'll
like the house your husband chose.

102
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,837
To each his own.

103
00:11:36,338 --> 00:11:38,380
Don't go scaring her.

104
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:42,131
Paulina, Miss Martin
is the neighbor I mentioned.

105
00:11:43,819 --> 00:11:46,847
- Pleased to meet you.
- I trust we'll be good friends.

106
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,245
Not much fun around here. And having
a writer as a husband must be boring.

107
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:54,261
What do you think of this
creature? It came by train.

108
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:57,200
My sister and I have
a soft spot for animals.

109
00:11:57,225 --> 00:12:00,290
They're more intelligent
than most of the men.

110
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:02,796
Of course, novelists
are the exception.

111
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,282
I'll be seeing you. Don't vanish!

112
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:09,491
Don't be discouraged.

113
00:12:09,516 --> 00:12:13,703
Like all spinsters, Miss Martin
is an incorrigible chatterbox.

114
00:12:13,728 --> 00:12:15,983
But she's helped us break the ice.

115
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:19,076
Why did you make her
think I was your wife?

116
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,090
Oh!

117
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,962
Once she came to see me.
Or rather she invaded my house.

118
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:28,060
I got scared and lied
about being married.

119
00:12:28,285 --> 00:12:30,908
She seemed determined
to organize my life.

120
00:12:31,403 --> 00:12:35,356
Judging by your ad, you'd think that
that's what you were looking for.

121
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:39,975
Yes, but my search was more demanding.

122
00:12:41,311 --> 00:12:43,233
A companion for life.

123
00:12:44,878 --> 00:12:47,023
<i>A companion for life.</i>

124
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:51,926
<i>What an infinite promise
in such a brief phrase.</i>

125
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:56,506
<i>Paulina Figueroa can now hear
life's warm callings.</i>

126
00:12:57,681 --> 00:13:00,983
<i>The time has come to leave
her in company of her destiny.</i>

127
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,816
She was terribly selfish.

128
00:13:13,671 --> 00:13:15,622
She'd humiliate me with her money.

129
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:18,969
And she could never
understand my urge to write.

130
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,560
Finally, after many bitter years...

131
00:13:23,585 --> 00:13:26,724
we were divorced
and I returned from France.

132
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:29,718
I felt old and weary.

133
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:33,180
And I sought shelter in solitude.

134
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:35,204
And this healed my wound.

135
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:39,023
But it also finally awoke in my heart...

136
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:42,590
the need for a new and real home.

137
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:49,569
Then I realized... that it was too late
to get involved in other people's lives.

138
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:53,267
The ad was my only hope.

139
00:13:53,592 --> 00:13:56,705
I perceived part of what you're
saying from your letter.

140
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,091
Perhaps that's why I decided to reply.

141
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:03,564
Do you know why
I chose yours among the other letters?

142
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:06,813
Because yours was so sincere.

143
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,949
It revealed the
sweetness of your character.

144
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,122
And the strength of your personality.

145
00:14:13,725 --> 00:14:15,953
Maybe I'm different
from what you imagine.

146
00:14:15,978 --> 00:14:19,152
My father would turn on his
grave if he could see me now.

147
00:14:19,504 --> 00:14:21,640
He would always mock my lack of spirit.

148
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:23,924
How little your father knew you.

149
00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:25,746
But I believe in fate.

150
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:29,859
I shudder to think that I might not
have read the newspaper that day.

151
00:14:30,571 --> 00:14:32,513
None of this would have happened.

152
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:39,197
I... believe, Mr. Morán,
that you've hypnotized me.

153
00:14:39,222 --> 00:14:40,961
I've never talked this way.

154
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,559
Truth be told...

155
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:47,296
I've never had anyone
to talk to this way.

156
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:52,989
I hope you have me
for the rest of your life.

157
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:56,813
Nothing would be better.

158
00:15:07,355 --> 00:15:08,633
THE CHIMERA

159
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:25,314
The first time I saw the house,
I also thought it looked gloomy.

160
00:15:26,005 --> 00:15:28,475
Who convinced you to rent this house?

161
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,900
Nobody.

162
00:15:30,121 --> 00:15:33,042
On the contrary,
some people tried to dissuade me.

163
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:36,388
Miss Martin even mentioned a ghost.

164
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:38,972
Just wait for spring to bloom.

165
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:41,705
The island will be covered
in flowers and birds.

166
00:15:42,701 --> 00:15:46,725
- Are there ghosts?
- I've never seen any.

167
00:15:47,956 --> 00:15:51,917
But if there were. Wouldn't you
want to help me chase them away?

168
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:34,902
I hope you like my tea.

169
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,859
An old friend sends it to me from India.

170
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,490
That's why I like
to prepare it myself.

171
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:46,686
Do you want to pour it?
Unless you're superstitious.

172
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:57,394
- Penny for your thoughts.
- You'd laugh if I told you.

173
00:16:57,973 --> 00:16:59,329
- Try me.
- It's...

174
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:05,056
I haven't spoken much to
men since my father's death.

175
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:09,432
Now it's your turn.

176
00:17:09,857 --> 00:17:12,713
- My turn?
- I've told you nearly all my life.

177
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:14,956
But I hardly know anything about yours.

178
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:18,973
Are you really so alone in the world?

179
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:24,521
So much that... if I were to have an
accident, no one would ask about me.

180
00:17:24,546 --> 00:17:25,901
How pessimistic.

181
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:29,345
What about relatives?
They're a necessary evil.

182
00:17:29,642 --> 00:17:31,517
I may have some
very distant ones.

183
00:17:31,542 --> 00:17:34,617
But they've never
shown any interest in me.

184
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,344
I've been pretty much alone.
On or two friends... and my lawyer.

185
00:17:40,504 --> 00:17:41,688
Your lawyer?

186
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,920
Mr. Sause. But I hardly see him.

187
00:17:44,945 --> 00:17:47,817
Practically only when
I go for my yearly check.

188
00:17:47,842 --> 00:17:50,308
That means that he
handles all your business.

189
00:17:51,129 --> 00:17:54,099
But do you at least know where
your money is invested?

190
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,766
No. I don't know any details.

191
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:00,000
I pay him to look after my interests.

192
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:03,022
And what if he
didn't do his job properly?

193
00:18:04,676 --> 00:18:08,292
Impossible. He was my
father's lawyer for twenty years.

194
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:12,445
I suspect you have
an exceedingly trusting nature.

195
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:16,611
For example: You hardly know me.

196
00:18:17,373 --> 00:18:20,320
I could very well be
a penniless adventurer...

197
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:23,038
on the lookout for a woman like you.

198
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:27,184
No, Mr. Morán. If that were so
you wouldn't have chosen me.

199
00:18:27,725 --> 00:18:30,613
There are many wealthy
women who would be glad to...

200
00:18:31,999 --> 00:18:34,223
...marry an obscure writer?

201
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:41,689
A man whose spirit is broken?
Who prefers to live in the shadows?

202
00:18:42,537 --> 00:18:44,817
How little you know
about women, Paulina.

203
00:18:46,903 --> 00:18:49,078
Some of them prefer the simple life.

204
00:18:49,724 --> 00:18:51,980
And now, tell me about your books.

205
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:54,624
What for? There's so little to tell...

206
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:57,231
I'd rather show
you the rest of the house.

207
00:19:00,122 --> 00:19:04,017
Your presence has already begun
to dispel the sadness in this house.

208
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:14,975
The kitchen.

209
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:19,605
It's not very modern, but
Mrs. Salcedo manages quite well.

210
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,066
This way.

211
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:27,407
That's the woodshed.

212
00:19:28,932 --> 00:19:33,552
That's where I write the novels
that might drive you away from me.

213
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,654
I also use it as a carpentry shed.

214
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,578
Yes, that's another one
of my hobbies. Come, Paulina.

215
00:20:36,094 --> 00:20:37,316
THE BOAR

216
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:55,193
We still have time...
Will the Portuguese guy come through?

217
00:20:55,218 --> 00:20:56,704
Do you think he'll dare?

218
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,278
- Hello, Mr. Morán.
- Mr. Mayer.

219
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,563
- This is my wife.
- Glad to meet you, madam. Finally here.

220
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,567
- Will you be having lunch?
- Yes.

221
00:21:08,592 --> 00:21:11,080
Put some champagne on ice.

222
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,735
- An anniversary?
- You guessed it, Mr. Mayer.

223
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,209
Fifth wedding anniversary.

224
00:21:15,434 --> 00:21:16,483
On my way!

225
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,619
It looks like Miss Martin spread my lie!

226
00:21:26,187 --> 00:21:29,755
Of course it's Paul Deval.
A bit older.

227
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,652
But it's him all right.

228
00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:37,999
- What could he be doing around here?
- The usual...

229
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:40,928
- I'm going to find out.
- Waiter!

230
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:44,731
Mr. Marchand?

231
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,822
Isn't that Mr. Deval
with the young woman?

232
00:21:50,385 --> 00:21:53,510
No. It's Mr. Morán, from
"The Chimera" island, and his wife.

233
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:57,118
I must have confused him with
someone else. Some beer, please.

234
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,484
Perhaps it's not him.

235
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:05,382
I don't know... But it would be natural
for him to have changed his name.

236
00:22:06,173 --> 00:22:10,453
He was found innocent, but all of
Paris believes Deval killed his wife.

237
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,371
To Mrs. Paulina Morán.

238
00:22:38,596 --> 00:22:41,333
To the stingiest man alive.

239
00:22:47,445 --> 00:22:49,619
- Just a moment.
- Where are you going?

240
00:22:50,435 --> 00:22:51,778
It's a secret.

241
00:22:51,903 --> 00:22:55,782
You leave... you leave and
every minute feels like an hour.

242
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,263
My wedding gift.

243
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,999
Have a look.

244
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:48,995
LIFE INSURANCE POLICY

245
00:23:58,081 --> 00:24:04,073
<i>I leave everything I own to my
dear wife Paulina Figueroa de Morán.</i>

246
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:08,890
<i>My estate in all concepts
will be transferred to her.</i>

247
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:13,547
Thank you, darling.

248
00:24:13,572 --> 00:24:16,620
It just occurred to me that
I should have done the same.

249
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:19,833
But I suppose you'd be
the one that inherits my money.

250
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,110
Isn't that so?

251
00:24:21,619 --> 00:24:25,191
It's more likely that your
distant relatives would fight over it.

252
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,321
That would be very unfair.

253
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:31,055
One of these days I have to go to
Buenos Aires to transfer my apartment.

254
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,870
I'll go and see Mr. Sause.

255
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:35,633
Leaving me so soon?

256
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:43,207
I won't allow it.

257
00:24:44,847 --> 00:24:48,432
Besides, any attorney in Tigre
can authenticate your will.

258
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:53,700
But what would Mr. Sause think?
That you made me do it?

259
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,532
Especially if he
thinks you're a "snob".

260
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:01,419
Why are we even talking
about these silly things?

261
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:04,099
- Is there any rush?
- None.

262
00:25:06,578 --> 00:25:07,531
I love you.

263
00:25:10,112 --> 00:25:12,217
And I have no plans to die so soon.

264
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:16,152
It would jeopardize you, wouldn't it?

265
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,156
Me?

266
00:25:18,036 --> 00:25:20,291
You should read some crime novels.

267
00:25:21,016 --> 00:25:23,987
The ingénue marries a stranger.

268
00:25:24,407 --> 00:25:28,966
She writes her will
and soon dies in a solitary place.

269
00:25:29,681 --> 00:25:31,440
Like the woodshed, for example.

270
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:37,020
You see, my love? Now you
have a plot for your next novel.

271
00:26:00,954 --> 00:26:02,170
Good morning.

272
00:26:03,472 --> 00:26:04,992
Are you Mrs. Salcedo?

273
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,864
- Can I start the cleaning?
- As you wish.

274
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,870
- Is the master in?
- He went to the woodshed.

275
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:13,713
I see you're an early bird.

276
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,817
Good. That means I can finish earlier.

277
00:26:17,317 --> 00:26:21,690
My husband mentioned that...
you wouldn't stay overnight.

278
00:26:22,401 --> 00:26:25,504
Where do you expect to find
a decent woman at night?

279
00:26:26,016 --> 00:26:27,816
In her own bed, madam!

280
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:32,195
Besides, I wouldn't live in this
house for all the money in the world.

281
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,147
Why not?

282
00:26:33,763 --> 00:26:36,063
Didn't your husband
mention the lost soul?

283
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:39,431
- The ghost!
- It's not a joke, madam.

284
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:44,365
You'll see it. It's the ghost
of a woman who lived right here.

285
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:48,815
One night her husband threw her out,
and she drowned herself in the creek.

286
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:53,206
They say she cursed this house...

287
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:55,590
so that nobody would be happy in it.

288
00:26:56,154 --> 00:26:58,770
You can't really believe that story.

289
00:26:58,795 --> 00:27:00,295
It's not a story, ma'am.

290
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,113
Some neighbors have seen her
at night; dressed in white and crying.

291
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:06,099
I'd die if I saw her.

292
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,747
If you need a woman all day,
you'll have to look for someone else.

293
00:27:09,772 --> 00:27:11,653
No, no. That's not what I meant.

294
00:27:12,886 --> 00:27:14,678
What time should I serve lunch?

295
00:27:14,803 --> 00:27:17,690
At... I'd better ask my husband.

296
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:41,903
- Hugo...
- What's the matter?

297
00:27:42,487 --> 00:27:46,104
Nothing, darling. You won't
ever leave me here alone, will you?

298
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:47,887
You're trembling!

299
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:51,800
But... I bet that stupid
hag has been telling you stories.

300
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:54,637
Paulina...

301
00:27:55,277 --> 00:27:57,973
- Has that nonsense scared you?
- No.

302
00:27:57,998 --> 00:27:59,896
But the house is so gloomy...

303
00:28:00,293 --> 00:28:03,175
Perhaps it would look more
cheerful if we painted it.

304
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,287
Why waste our money?
The contract will expire by Christmas.

305
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:11,639
And... perhaps
we won't be here by then.

306
00:28:11,664 --> 00:28:12,727
Why not?

307
00:28:13,446 --> 00:28:17,182
No... don't tell me. Let me guess.

308
00:28:18,409 --> 00:28:20,330
I know! Your book?

309
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:22,346
- Perhaps.
- You're right.

310
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,818
It will be a success and we'll be rich.

311
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:27,877
Was that what you
wanted to tell me, darling?

312
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:30,053
What else could it have been?

313
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:33,815
From now on
you'll have to work harder.

314
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:38,143
I'll be less selfish and
only steal your nights.

315
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:40,127
Won't you get bored during the day?

316
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,853
I'll let you write. And if have time...

317
00:28:42,878 --> 00:28:46,492
I'll plant a garden there so you
can see the flowers while you work.

318
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:00,572
Here's the list, madam.
Don't forget the ant poison.

319
00:29:00,597 --> 00:29:03,464
Hurry up, Paulina!
I'll get the speedboat out.

320
00:29:35,637 --> 00:29:36,876
Mrs. Morán!

321
00:29:42,552 --> 00:29:44,912
Mrs. Morán! At last we meet again.

322
00:29:44,937 --> 00:29:47,847
We thought you were dead.
This is my sister Josefina.

323
00:29:47,872 --> 00:29:50,719
- Pleased to meet you.
- You've let us down, ma'am.

324
00:29:50,744 --> 00:29:55,848
When you arrived we thought we'd
gained a neighbor. Instead we lost two.

325
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:58,419
Hugo and I are very
attached to our house.

326
00:29:58,444 --> 00:29:59,862
Don't be so clannish.

327
00:29:59,887 --> 00:30:04,887
Us spinsters enjoy meeting a man
we can look at every now and then.

328
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:07,168
Why don't you come to dinner some time?

329
00:30:07,193 --> 00:30:09,928
You'll meet Cecilia
and see our greenhouse.

330
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:12,153
Of course. We'll go
one of these nights.

331
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,877
- How about next Monday?
- Fine.

332
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:17,930
- Nine o'clock. Don't forget.
- Don't worry.

333
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:20,738
And say hello
to your hermit husband for us.

334
00:30:21,423 --> 00:30:22,520
Goodbye.

335
00:30:29,967 --> 00:30:30,831
Hi!

336
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:35,646
- Get your shopping done?
- All of it. What about you?

337
00:30:35,671 --> 00:30:40,109
Uhuh. I went to the post office.
They gave me this letter.

338
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:45,179
It's from Agatha!

339
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:52,905
Listen to this.

340
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,383
"When will I see your alluring house
and meet your seductive husband?"

341
00:30:57,408 --> 00:31:01,471
"We'll end up thinking he's an enfeebled
old man if you keep on hiding him."

342
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:05,745
The gossip that must be
going around at the Female Society.

343
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:09,102
We'll have to invite her.

344
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,281
I don't want them
to think you married a cripple.

345
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,504
Why don't you go get her?

346
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,579
You wanted to see your
apartment and I believe... your lawyer.

347
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:23,321
Good idea. Thanks for
reminding me of my will.

348
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:26,042
I'll ring Mr. Sause and
tell him I'm going tomorrow.

349
00:31:35,949 --> 00:31:38,925
- Excuse me.
- Don't leave, miss. I'm through here.

350
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:42,104
- Thank you, sir. And pardon me.
- Not at all.

351
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:45,118
This cabin seems to be
full of pleasant surprises.

352
00:31:56,398 --> 00:31:58,214
Something to drink, Mr. Casares?

353
00:31:58,567 --> 00:32:01,475
I'll have some whisky in honor
of your telephone cabin.

354
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,677
Did you buy it from
a wizard, Mr. Mayer?

355
00:32:17,427 --> 00:32:20,202
What a pity. Sause is away.

356
00:32:20,727 --> 00:32:24,729
But... What about his partner?
Didn't you say he had a partner?

357
00:32:24,954 --> 00:32:26,940
He's an unbearable individual.

358
00:32:26,965 --> 00:32:29,555
I'm more comfortable
with Mr. Sause. Anyway...

359
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,594
I'll write to Agatha and invite her.

360
00:32:32,386 --> 00:32:33,572
Today.

361
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:36,493
She must know right away
that I'm not a monster.

362
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:40,370
- What will it be, Mrs. Morán?
- Tea with toasts.

363
00:32:41,443 --> 00:32:44,547
Guess what? You'll have to
wear a black tie on Monday.

364
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:47,125
Miss Martin has invited us to dinner.

365
00:32:47,907 --> 00:32:51,324
In honor of the world's happiest couple.

366
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,604
- Come in!
- Hello, Miss Martin.

367
00:33:00,022 --> 00:33:03,326
I can't believe it.
The first visit in two months!

368
00:33:03,466 --> 00:33:06,600
- You can be sure it won't be the last.
- I hope not.

369
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:09,015
- Where's your sister?
- Taking care of Cecilia.

370
00:33:09,191 --> 00:33:10,479
She'll be right down.

371
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:12,156
Well! Mario!

372
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:19,360
My nephew, Mario Casares.
An officer in the National Police.

373
00:33:30,318 --> 00:33:33,174
Excuse me, I'll go check on Cecilia.

374
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,911
Come on, Mrs. Morán. Be frank.

375
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:41,192
Explain your husband's mystery.

376
00:33:41,925 --> 00:33:44,373
Mystery? There's none.

377
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:47,506
Then how can you live
in that horrible house?

378
00:33:48,603 --> 00:33:51,764
People suspect you're
involved in black magic.

379
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:58,873
Very flattering. But I must confess
that the truth isn't so enthralling.

380
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:00,219
My aunt is something else.

381
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,918
Ever since I gave her
a set of crime novels...

382
00:34:02,943 --> 00:34:05,842
she keeps trying to solve
mysteries everywhere.

383
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,610
How's Cecilia doing?

384
00:34:11,594 --> 00:34:12,946
Not so good.

385
00:34:12,971 --> 00:34:14,981
Don't worry and drink your coffee.

386
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:17,996
So when will you publish
your famous book, Mr. Morán?

387
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:19,773
I can't wait to read it.

388
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:24,047
I'm afraid it won't be
as exciting as your crime novels.

389
00:34:25,226 --> 00:34:27,403
It's a novel without any mysteries.

390
00:34:27,428 --> 00:34:29,135
Please excuse me.

391
00:34:33,252 --> 00:34:35,436
- More coffee, Mr. Morán?
- No, thanks.

392
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,700
I've always envied writers.

393
00:34:38,188 --> 00:34:41,635
It must be marvelous to be able
to invent beautiful adventures.

394
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:45,229
There's something better than
inventing them which is to live them.

395
00:34:45,254 --> 00:34:47,616
As is surely the case with Mr. Casares.

396
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:48,682
Not quite, ma'am.

397
00:34:49,205 --> 00:34:53,277
Going after a murderer
is not as exciting as in the movies.

398
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,189
But you do need a lot of courage.

399
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:56,751
This is also no merit.

400
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,608
At my age,
I'm too young to think of fear.

401
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:04,252
<i>Quick, quick! Cecilia's
just had quintuplets!</i>

402
00:35:04,277 --> 00:35:05,364
Quintuplets!

403
00:35:05,757 --> 00:35:08,537
Don't be alarmed, ma'am.
Come let's go see Cecilia.

404
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,382
What did you think of the reception?

405
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:36,948
Unforgettable...
when I think it'll be the last one.

406
00:35:36,973 --> 00:35:38,109
Was it that boring?

407
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:40,456
I must confess I had a lot of fun.

408
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:42,992
It felt like a Female Society dinner.

409
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,951
Cecilia was the star of the night.

410
00:35:49,453 --> 00:35:51,447
But the young man was nice, wasn't he?

411
00:35:51,846 --> 00:35:53,266
The national policeman?

412
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:56,623
Cops were never my thing.

413
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:59,389
Good thing we won't see him again.

414
00:36:23,284 --> 00:36:26,740
MR. PAUL DEVAL
CHIMERA ISLAND

415
00:36:26,765 --> 00:36:29,020
RM CHOEL CREEK
TIGRE

416
00:36:31,021 --> 00:36:32,532
It's the wrong address.

417
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:36,819
No... it's for me.

418
00:36:38,749 --> 00:36:40,948
Strange, I thought I had mentioned it.

419
00:36:41,934 --> 00:36:44,397
It was my pen name in France.

420
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:51,086
So many secrets you must hide from me.

421
00:36:52,012 --> 00:36:54,612
You already know the only important one.

422
00:36:56,544 --> 00:36:57,984
That I adore you.

423
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:15,538
<i>You will find the motive
for this letter very interesting.</i>

424
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:21,207
<i>We'll be waiting for you next Thursday
at 4 PM at the Lander lumberyard.</i>

425
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,238
Good afternoon, Lander.

426
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:49,666
The gentlemen you
summoned are waiting for you.

427
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:53,046
Yes, they're interested in
this business. I'll explain later.

428
00:37:53,071 --> 00:37:53,956
Where are they?

429
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:27,943
Well? Here I am.

430
00:38:29,361 --> 00:38:31,762
Mr. Deval... Excuse me...

431
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:34,889
Doubtlessly you prefer
we address you as Mr. Morán?

432
00:38:36,642 --> 00:38:37,979
Makes no difference.

433
00:38:38,132 --> 00:38:39,140
Are you sure?

434
00:38:39,165 --> 00:38:43,724
They don't know Morán In Paris.
But everyone remembers Paul Deval.

435
00:38:44,068 --> 00:38:45,049
Flatterer...

436
00:38:45,874 --> 00:38:51,200
There's a certain kind of popularity
that nobody wants, Mr. Deval.

437
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:54,430
Yours, for example,
might alarm your wife.

438
00:39:07,183 --> 00:39:09,212
How much to avoid the annoyance?

439
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:11,834
40,000 pesos.

440
00:39:13,801 --> 00:39:15,810
I'll need a few days to get the sum.

441
00:39:15,835 --> 00:39:18,201
A deal like the one in Paris?

442
00:39:19,301 --> 00:39:20,493
Perhaps.

443
00:39:20,573 --> 00:39:21,828
A week?

444
00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:24,204
Two weeks from today.

445
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:25,898
Your place?

446
00:39:28,163 --> 00:39:29,755
At the Boar Inn.

447
00:39:34,419 --> 00:39:37,812
You have to admire the bastard.
I almost gave him a discount.

448
00:39:38,238 --> 00:39:41,845
We'll pay our respects
when he becomes a widower.

449
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,045
How about a beer in advance?

450
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,070
Let's go.

451
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:55,878
Forgive me, darling.
Lander kept me longer than expected.

452
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:02,542
Mrs. Salcedo, this is for the
living room windows. Leave it there.

453
00:41:05,575 --> 00:41:07,783
Why are you looking
at me like that, Agatha?

454
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:09,191
Do you think I've changed?

455
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:12,012
I'm amazed.

456
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:13,837
You look ten years younger.

457
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:18,067
Truth be told,
I looked ten years older before.

458
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,650
Where did you meet him?

459
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,350
I mean your husband.

460
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:30,892
I could hold it against you that
you never talked much about him.

461
00:41:31,687 --> 00:41:33,374
I was afraid you'd mock me.

462
00:41:33,399 --> 00:41:36,630
Or that my marriage to
a stranger would seem crazy to you.

463
00:41:37,149 --> 00:41:38,573
But how did you meet him?

464
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:44,864
Nowadays it's almost impossible to find
a man who is... at least presentable.

465
00:41:46,108 --> 00:41:50,773
You found one who is more interesting
than what any one of us aspired.

466
00:41:51,404 --> 00:41:52,948
I met him at a station.

467
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:54,179
By chance?

468
00:41:57,488 --> 00:41:59,280
I believe in fate, Agatha.

469
00:42:00,179 --> 00:42:03,020
Sooner or later, I had to meet him.

470
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:08,762
Is he a widower?

471
00:42:09,587 --> 00:42:11,443
- Divorced?
- No.

472
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:13,594
<i>Can I come in?</i>

473
00:42:13,819 --> 00:42:14,857
Yes, darling.

474
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:19,065
We'll have tea in a little while.

475
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,954
I wish we had a better
room to offer you, Miss Valle.

476
00:42:25,979 --> 00:42:27,877
But this one is very comfortable.

477
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:30,003
It'll look much better
after I've cleaned it.

478
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:32,329
Why don't you show her
the island while I finish?

479
00:42:32,354 --> 00:42:34,909
- Glad to!
- Please don't bother on my account.

480
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:37,962
On the contrary, it shall be
a pleasure to show you our paradise.

481
00:42:38,295 --> 00:42:41,276
Let's enjoy that I'm married
to such a wonderful woman.

482
00:42:41,301 --> 00:42:44,094
She's not afraid of
leaving me alone with you.

483
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:45,440
Come.

484
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:55,428
So, what did you think of Paulina?

485
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:57,274
Splendid.

486
00:42:58,564 --> 00:43:00,653
Much better than
when she was single.

487
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:02,139
Is that so?

488
00:43:02,877 --> 00:43:05,038
You can't imagine how that flatters me.

489
00:43:05,263 --> 00:43:10,161
By feeling... somewhat
responsible for that transformation.

490
00:43:13,597 --> 00:43:17,502
She... she told me she
had met you at a station.

491
00:43:17,527 --> 00:43:18,576
That's right.

492
00:43:20,136 --> 00:43:23,159
I had gone to meet
a woman I didn't know.

493
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:26,503
I had to pick her out
among all the others.

494
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:29,925
Then I saw Paulina.

495
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:33,923
Will you laugh if I tell you
it was love at first sight?

496
00:43:36,036 --> 00:43:37,345
Very romantic.

497
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,316
She wasn't offended when I spoke.

498
00:43:39,773 --> 00:43:41,365
That was reassuring to me.

499
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:46,361
I admire women who can tackle life.

500
00:43:47,212 --> 00:43:50,523
That's incredible.
Paulina was always very shy.

501
00:43:51,824 --> 00:43:56,873
When a woman finds love,
she loses those little hang-ups.

502
00:44:00,015 --> 00:44:02,981
Come. I'll show you
the best part of our island.

503
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,786
This is the famous creek
where the ghost drowned.

504
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:23,640
What ghost?

505
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:26,401
Didn't Paulina mention
it in her letters?

506
00:44:26,426 --> 00:44:28,503
- No.
- How odd!

507
00:44:29,011 --> 00:44:30,684
She thinks of nothing else.

508
00:44:31,202 --> 00:44:35,050
Just imagine. She's living
in a house with a ghost...

509
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:37,275
and the ghost won't show up.

510
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:39,820
Paulina feels let down.

511
00:44:41,707 --> 00:44:45,668
Sometimes I feel like dressing up in a
bed sheet and hiding in the woods.

512
00:44:46,575 --> 00:44:48,276
Just to please her.

513
00:44:49,402 --> 00:44:51,030
She'd be frightened to death.

514
00:44:51,386 --> 00:44:52,776
I doubt it, Miss Valle.

515
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:58,342
Any woman who marries
a stranger must be very brave.

516
00:44:58,467 --> 00:45:00,700
But Paulina gets frightened by a mouse!

517
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,548
That is a privilege
that is almost exclusively female.

518
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:08,851
All intelligent women
are afraid of mice!

519
00:45:10,682 --> 00:45:16,337
To me, that's one of Paulina's...
most charming characteristics.

520
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:17,845
- Tea is ready, sir.
- Thank you, Mrs. Salcedo.

521
00:46:18,898 --> 00:46:23,090
You can leave now. Tomorrow, on
the other hand, we'll need you all day.

522
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:25,203
If that's all right with you.

523
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:26,924
No problem, sir.

524
00:46:28,233 --> 00:46:29,754
I'll take it.

525
00:46:31,494 --> 00:46:33,363
- See you tomorrow.
- Until tomorrow.

526
00:46:41,235 --> 00:46:43,922
Mrs. Salcedo asked to leave early.

527
00:46:44,722 --> 00:46:47,611
I think she's going
to the dentist or something.

528
00:46:48,102 --> 00:46:50,278
But she'll be here all day tomorrow.

529
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,263
Was I wrong to let her go?

530
00:46:53,136 --> 00:46:55,359
Everything you do is right.

531
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,209
Tea?

532
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:08,848
Not for me.
I've got a splitting headache.

533
00:47:08,873 --> 00:47:10,515
I'll go get you some aspirin.

534
00:47:10,698 --> 00:47:12,595
Thanks, I already had one.

535
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:17,242
Why don't you lie down a while?
My train doesn't leave until seven.

536
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:20,109
You're right. I won't be long.

537
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:22,902
Hugo, don't let Agatha get bored.

538
00:47:46,849 --> 00:47:50,472
Now that were alone,
I'll confess something.

539
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:58,129
This week I was afraid your presence
would remind her of her old amusements.

540
00:48:00,784 --> 00:48:03,624
The Female Society is not much fun.

541
00:48:04,013 --> 00:48:07,774
Yes, but she had friends
who took her out for some fun.

542
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:10,497
Where?

543
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:13,848
Did Paulina tell you that?

544
00:48:14,797 --> 00:48:16,637
She keeps no secrets from me.

545
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:19,333
I see.

546
00:48:20,672 --> 00:48:23,399
Will you tell my wife
if I leave you for a while?

547
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:27,969
I have to go to the lumberyard to get
some wood for the roof in the woodshed.

548
00:48:28,294 --> 00:48:31,976
Go on. I'll pick
some flowers in the meantime.

549
00:48:32,223 --> 00:48:33,228
Perfect!

550
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:36,783
You'll take with you
the best memento from this house:

551
00:48:36,808 --> 00:48:38,649
Paulina's roses.

552
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:40,529
See you later.

553
00:49:33,584 --> 00:49:34,727
Agatha?

554
00:50:08,015 --> 00:50:09,110
Agatha!

555
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:21,544
Hugo!

556
00:51:19,627 --> 00:51:20,835
Agatha!

557
00:51:44,321 --> 00:51:45,672
Hugo!

558
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:11,413
Paulina!

559
00:52:45,807 --> 00:52:46,926
Come, help me!

560
00:52:47,509 --> 00:52:49,052
Paulina had an accident.

561
00:52:49,793 --> 00:52:51,025
Are you sure?

562
00:52:52,090 --> 00:52:54,465
- Maybe it was a shock.
- A shock?

563
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,120
Look!

564
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,823
Perhaps it was a shock, nevertheless.

565
00:53:03,682 --> 00:53:05,699
Perhaps she saw the ghost after all!

566
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:09,634
Why are you staring at me like that?

567
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,796
Didn't you say she wanted to see it?

568
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:23,602
- What do you know about the ghost?
- Hypocrite!

569
00:53:24,445 --> 00:53:26,392
Isn't it what you wanted to happen?

570
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:31,002
Look at your formidable wife!
Turned into a rag!

571
00:53:33,014 --> 00:53:35,472
The brave Paulina was
almost scared to death!

572
00:53:35,797 --> 00:53:38,752
She was terrified! Isn't that so?

573
00:53:39,144 --> 00:53:40,240
Answer me!

574
00:53:40,265 --> 00:53:41,806
You mean it was you?

575
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:48,317
- What's this, Miss Valle?
- You know it as well as I do.

576
00:53:48,612 --> 00:53:52,204
Why do you ask me?
You've got eyes just like everyone else!

577
00:53:53,081 --> 00:53:56,009
- Do you realize what you've done?
- Let me go!

578
00:53:57,309 --> 00:54:01,812
It's useless to blame me! You're solely
responsible and I'll tell anyone I want!

579
00:54:01,837 --> 00:54:04,364
I'm not an idiot like your wife!

580
00:54:06,198 --> 00:54:07,179
Shut up!

581
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:10,457
You're poisoned with envy!

582
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:12,433
You fraud!

583
00:54:15,951 --> 00:54:17,303
Shut up I said!

584
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:21,575
You won't stay
a minute longer in this house!

585
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:22,592
Go!

586
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,322
I got so annoyed with her envy,

587
00:54:41,183 --> 00:54:43,984
that I started to
exaggerate my wife's virtues.

588
00:54:45,256 --> 00:54:47,023
Perhaps I overdid it, doctor.

589
00:54:47,348 --> 00:54:51,153
And that idiot of a woman,
overcome by jealousy,

590
00:54:51,808 --> 00:54:55,616
tried to make a fool of Paulina
by dressing up as a ghost.

591
00:54:55,641 --> 00:54:57,602
- Is she still here?
- No, doctor.

592
00:54:57,627 --> 00:54:59,982
I left her in Tigre
when I went to get you.

593
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:01,045
Better so.

594
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:06,590
Don't worry, the sedative
will help her rest all night.

595
00:55:07,755 --> 00:55:09,507
She'll be much better tomorrow.

596
00:55:30,136 --> 00:55:32,208
Should I tell her the truth, doctor?

597
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,081
Yes, but not tonight.

598
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,695
It will be a hard blow for Paulina.

599
00:55:38,191 --> 00:55:40,064
She was her best friend.

600
00:55:40,289 --> 00:55:44,107
It's better to lose a friend than
to live under the spell of a ghost.

601
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:35,879
Hugo!

602
00:56:38,442 --> 00:56:40,356
Paulina, it's me.

603
00:56:40,381 --> 00:56:42,426
I came to see how you were doing.

604
00:56:43,521 --> 00:56:45,945
Turn on the lamp, I beg you!

605
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:06,159
Darling, you're soaking wet.
You need to change your clothes.

606
00:57:06,184 --> 00:57:08,079
No, don't leave.

607
00:57:08,823 --> 00:57:10,953
I know it will be back when I'm alone.

608
00:57:13,851 --> 00:57:15,004
Listen to me!

609
00:57:15,667 --> 00:57:17,323
I need to tell you the truth.

610
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:21,354
Dr. Vargas advised me
to wait until tomorrow,

611
00:57:21,379 --> 00:57:23,699
but it's better
for you to know right now.

612
00:57:24,697 --> 00:57:28,108
Paulina... there was no ghost!

613
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:31,189
Your friend dressed up to scare you.

614
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:34,425
Agatha?

615
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:37,026
I saw her when she was
coming back from the woods,

616
00:57:37,051 --> 00:57:38,411
hiding the wedding veil.

617
00:57:38,436 --> 00:57:42,135
She was laughing like a madwoman.
Screaming that you were a coward!

618
00:57:42,786 --> 00:57:46,466
It's that... Agatha, my best friend...

619
00:57:46,491 --> 00:57:49,642
She was jealous, I know
because she couldn't hide it...

620
00:57:50,147 --> 00:57:52,331
But to exact such a cruel vengeance...

621
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:55,332
I don't want to see her again!

622
00:57:55,357 --> 00:57:57,386
You'll never see her again, darling.

623
00:57:57,411 --> 00:58:01,164
I lost control...
and I treated her violently.

624
00:58:02,148 --> 00:58:05,563
I don't think she'll want to
set foot in this house again.

625
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:14,633
- Do you feel better now?
- Yes, darling, but...

626
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:18,408
- What?
- Promise me we'll find another house.

627
00:58:19,825 --> 00:58:22,992
I promise you.
And now, get some rest.

628
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,768
I'll sleep in the other
room so I won't disturb you.

629
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,693
No.

630
00:58:28,292 --> 00:58:30,733
Don't ever leave me alone at night.

631
00:59:35,527 --> 00:59:36,888
What's wrong, Paulina?

632
00:59:37,213 --> 00:59:40,452
I woke up and didn't
see you. I got scared.

633
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:44,096
I went out for some fresh air.
It was too hot to sleep.

634
00:59:44,694 --> 00:59:45,743
Forgive me.

635
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:48,432
You have to get a hold of yourself.

636
00:59:48,975 --> 00:59:50,893
Remember what the doctor said.

637
00:59:51,427 --> 00:59:54,135
- Don't get angry, darling.
- I'm not angry!

638
00:59:54,954 --> 00:59:57,353
But I'm worried
that you're still obsessed.

639
00:59:58,223 --> 01:00:00,695
You're right. I know.

640
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,873
But I can't help it.

641
01:00:02,898 --> 01:00:06,633
When I'm alone, I feel like
something awful is threatening me.

642
01:00:07,444 --> 01:00:08,548
I'll get over it.

643
01:00:08,573 --> 01:00:12,719
When we leave this house I'll
forget about the whole thing, darling.

644
01:00:20,403 --> 01:00:21,415
THE LILACS

645
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,674
This is my dream house.

646
01:00:31,481 --> 01:00:33,216
Isn't it ideal for us?

647
01:00:33,718 --> 01:00:34,651
Yes...

648
01:00:35,787 --> 01:00:38,980
But 200,000 pesos
is a lot of money, Paulina.

649
01:00:40,135 --> 01:00:42,682
We can ask Gutiérrez
to get us a discount.

650
01:00:42,717 --> 01:00:45,524
He's forewarned us
that the owner wouldn't accept.

651
01:00:46,724 --> 01:00:50,540
Besides, you know I don't
have that kind of money.

652
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:57,620
I'm sorry if this a disappointment. But
we need to find something more modest.

653
01:00:58,198 --> 01:01:00,137
I'm not giving up.

654
01:01:00,675 --> 01:01:02,794
Do my relatives mean anything to you?

655
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:04,790
Of course not.

656
01:01:05,015 --> 01:01:06,621
Then, my love...

657
01:01:08,637 --> 01:01:10,092
"The Lilacs" is ours.

658
01:01:10,296 --> 01:01:13,416
We'll write to Mr. Sause today
asking him for the money.

659
01:01:14,252 --> 01:01:16,987
But can't you see that
this will reduce your income?

660
01:01:18,266 --> 01:01:22,179
Why should I care?
Doesn't my husband support me?

661
01:02:02,163 --> 01:02:03,250
Paulina!

662
01:02:07,779 --> 01:02:09,026
Where were you going?

663
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:10,829
I thought you were writing.

664
01:02:12,015 --> 01:02:16,015
You promised not go there until I'm
finished with the piece of furniture.

665
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:20,643
I want my present to be a real surprise.

666
01:02:20,668 --> 01:02:23,095
I bring my own surprise, darling. Look.

667
01:02:25,189 --> 01:02:26,799
250,000 pesos?

668
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:29,165
That's more than necessary.

669
01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:33,226
Of course. We'll have to buy furniture,
curtains, thousands of things!

670
01:02:33,974 --> 01:02:35,769
You're becoming a spendthrift.

671
01:02:36,194 --> 01:02:39,036
No. I want you to
deposit it in your account.

672
01:02:39,061 --> 01:02:40,352
But it's your money.

673
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:45,750
Our money. To buy our house.
Write to the agent today.

674
01:02:46,313 --> 01:02:48,345
- No, Paulina.
- Please.

675
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,505
It's my wedding gift.

676
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:54,136
- No, darling. No!
- I'm begging you. Take it.

677
01:02:55,942 --> 01:02:57,384
You've given me so much.

678
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:06,641
All right.

679
01:03:07,231 --> 01:03:10,752
Wait. I haven't said I accepted yet.

680
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:26,333
- If I miss, you'll take care
of everything. - That's not fair.

681
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:28,116
You'll miss on purpose.

682
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:32,979
I never cheat at games.

683
01:03:40,848 --> 01:03:43,324
<i>We hope to avoid visiting your home...</i>

684
01:03:43,649 --> 01:03:48,548
<i>As agreed, we'll wait for
you at the "Boar" in 3 DAYS.</i>

685
01:04:47,389 --> 01:04:49,373
Shall we meet at the inn as usual?

686
01:04:49,398 --> 01:04:52,108
Yes, but don't worry if I'm late.

687
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:56,048
Lander heard about us moving out of
Tigre and wants to buy the boat.

688
01:04:56,073 --> 01:04:57,605
I'm on my way to the lumberyard.

689
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:48,707
Three days...
three days... three days...

690
01:05:57,525 --> 01:05:58,884
- Good afternoon.
- Sir?

691
01:05:59,109 --> 01:06:01,824
I've come to pick up
a ticket for Paul Deval.

692
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:03,207
- Where to?
- Rome.

693
01:06:03,232 --> 01:06:04,614
Fine. Just a moment.

694
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,221
Here it is, Mr. Deval.
It's 3,160 pesos.

695
01:06:17,246 --> 01:06:20,618
Tomorrow at 10 PM at the
office or at 12 at the airport.

696
01:06:21,023 --> 01:06:22,519
Please pay at the cashier.

697
01:06:22,544 --> 01:06:23,463
Thank you.

698
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:40,894
Mrs. Morán. It's been a long time.

699
01:06:40,919 --> 01:06:43,453
We don't go out much, Mr. Casares.
How are your aunts?

700
01:06:43,478 --> 01:06:45,052
With Cecilia and her puppies.

701
01:06:45,077 --> 01:06:46,287
Can I give you a lift?

702
01:06:46,312 --> 01:06:49,142
- Don't bother, I'm close.
- Going to the inn?

703
01:06:49,367 --> 01:06:50,446
Get in, please.

704
01:06:59,328 --> 01:07:01,872
My aunts said you were
thinking of moving.

705
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:04,107
- Is that so?
- Yes.

706
01:07:04,132 --> 01:07:06,763
We found a beautiful house in Martínez.

707
01:07:07,328 --> 01:07:10,663
But I'm worried because the
agent hasn't answered yet.

708
01:07:11,292 --> 01:07:13,244
I'd hate to miss out on that house.

709
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:15,723
Do you dislike Tigre that much?

710
01:07:15,748 --> 01:07:17,724
Our island is too gloomy.

711
01:07:18,361 --> 01:07:21,832
It's hard to believe
joy is absent if you're around.

712
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:25,418
If you knew The Chimera, Mr. Casares...

713
01:07:25,443 --> 01:07:30,091
I've been there. We went to inspect
it due to the absurd ghost legend.

714
01:07:31,404 --> 01:07:35,828
And yet when you arrived,
I knew superstition would rise again.

715
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:41,355
Eventually there will be talk of
someone who was briefly on the island.

716
01:07:42,506 --> 01:07:44,233
Like an enchanting apparition.

717
01:07:45,373 --> 01:07:48,484
Thanks for the flattery,
but the fantasy is over.

718
01:07:48,709 --> 01:07:50,020
That's "The Boar".

719
01:08:05,003 --> 01:08:07,624
If I may, I'll keep you company
until your husband arrives.

720
01:08:07,649 --> 01:08:08,875
I'd like to greet him.

721
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:11,035
It might be the last time I see you two.

722
01:08:11,060 --> 01:08:13,660
Of course. I'll just be
a moment on the phone.

723
01:08:13,685 --> 01:08:15,064
Should I order some gin?

724
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:17,815
Just tea and toasts at this time of day.

725
01:08:27,141 --> 01:08:28,809
The usual whisky, Mr. Casares?

726
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:32,528
No. I prefer tea
nowadays, my dear Mayer.

727
01:08:36,222 --> 01:08:39,085
Mr. Gutiérrez? This is Mrs. Morán.

728
01:08:39,544 --> 01:08:40,979
How are you ma'am?

729
01:08:43,515 --> 01:08:47,270
But your husband wrote that you
were no longer interested in the house.

730
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:52,689
- You must be mistaken, Mr. Gutiérrez.
- Just a moment. I'll get the letter.

731
01:08:58,608 --> 01:09:01,192
- Yes?
- It's here. Listen.

732
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:04,560
"I'm letting you know
that after some consideration,

733
01:09:04,943 --> 01:09:07,663
"we've decided
not to purchase the house."

734
01:09:08,359 --> 01:09:11,968
"My wife finds it too large, and,
considering the high prices,

735
01:09:11,993 --> 01:09:14,945
"we think it better
to stay where we are."

736
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:16,994
"At least, until the contract expires."

737
01:09:17,286 --> 01:09:18,594
Was that clear, ma'am?

738
01:09:19,653 --> 01:09:21,204
Hello. Hello!

739
01:09:27,244 --> 01:09:30,382
<i>Own fortune.
No relatives a must.</i>

740
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:33,271
<i>I could very well be
a penniless adventurer...</i>

741
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:35,462
<i>on the lookout for a woman like you.</i>

742
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:39,872
<i>Besides, any attorney in Tigre
can authenticate your will.</i>

743
01:09:39,897 --> 01:09:45,232
<i>Strange, I thought I had mentioned it.
It was my pen name in France.</i>

744
01:09:45,257 --> 01:09:46,859
<i>Paul Deval.</i>

745
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:50,727
<i>I never cheat at games.</i>

746
01:10:05,394 --> 01:10:06,651
How are you, darling?

747
01:10:10,342 --> 01:10:11,567
Better.

748
01:10:12,127 --> 01:10:14,004
- It must have been the heat.
- Yes.

749
01:10:14,039 --> 01:10:16,355
Drink this cognac, madam.
It'll do you good.

750
01:10:17,790 --> 01:10:18,700
Thank you.

751
01:10:19,171 --> 01:10:21,003
We better get home straight away.

752
01:10:21,591 --> 01:10:22,522
No.

753
01:10:23,713 --> 01:10:27,714
I don't think I have the strength...
to walk to the boat.

754
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:29,770
Why don't you stay in Tigre tonight?

755
01:10:29,795 --> 01:10:33,483
It's not necessary.
I can take you to the pier in my Jeep.

756
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:36,779
- But...
- We'll appreciate it, Mr. Casares.

757
01:10:37,568 --> 01:10:39,184
Lean on me, darling.

758
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:12,159
The air will do you good.

759
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:14,937
Yes.

760
01:11:17,678 --> 01:11:20,537
- I went by the post office.
- Did Gutiérrez write?

761
01:11:21,639 --> 01:11:22,575
No.

762
01:11:24,742 --> 01:11:27,034
Don't you think he's taking a long time?

763
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:31,471
Real estate agents for you.
They start off in a rush...

764
01:11:33,505 --> 01:11:37,293
But... Did you explain in your
letter that it was urgent?

765
01:11:40,515 --> 01:11:42,283
I'll tell you the whole truth.

766
01:11:43,676 --> 01:11:47,201
I didn't tell you before so you
wouldn't think I was hot-headed.

767
01:11:47,942 --> 01:11:52,002
When I wrote for the second time, I sent
him a check for the price of the house.

768
01:11:52,027 --> 01:11:53,900
To settle the purchase.

769
01:11:54,995 --> 01:11:57,403
I've got his receipt on my desk.

770
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:02,131
Don't be alarmed.
I was careful about it.

771
01:12:03,432 --> 01:12:05,602
The check won't be
honored until I agree.

772
01:12:26,536 --> 01:12:27,840
Sit down, darling.

773
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,121
Madam had a bit of a sunstroke.

774
01:12:33,146 --> 01:12:34,364
Should I make some tea?

775
01:12:34,389 --> 01:12:35,505
I'll make it.

776
01:12:36,156 --> 01:12:37,972
For the cupboard, Mrs. Salcedo.

777
01:12:39,265 --> 01:12:41,199
And here's the ant poison.

778
01:12:43,831 --> 01:12:45,053
I'll go get the tea.

779
01:12:47,739 --> 01:12:51,489
- Mrs. Salcedo, could you do me a favor?
- What is it?

780
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:56,312
Could you... stay until tomorrow.
I feel really sick...

781
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,791
And we're so isolated.

782
01:12:58,816 --> 01:13:03,575
I'm sorry, madam. I wouldn't be able
to sleep a wink in this house.

783
01:13:04,895 --> 01:13:06,327
Just for tonight?

784
01:13:06,352 --> 01:13:08,976
Impossible. Excuse me, madam.

785
01:13:33,969 --> 01:13:35,401
Here, Mrs. Salcedo.

786
01:13:35,426 --> 01:13:38,679
- What is it?
- The list of things I didn't get today.

787
01:13:38,704 --> 01:13:42,735
Very well, madam. Dinner is in
the cupboard. See you tomorrow.

788
01:13:44,339 --> 01:13:45,605
Come, darling.

789
01:13:48,012 --> 01:13:49,525
You still don't look well.

790
01:13:56,832 --> 01:13:58,403
I'll go get the sugar bowl.

791
01:14:28,073 --> 01:14:29,042
Two?

792
01:14:32,944 --> 01:14:34,896
The heat is unbearable.

793
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:51,124
- Aren't you having your tea?
- Yes.

794
01:15:07,059 --> 01:15:11,387
<i>Please, run and tell Miss Martin
to come and see me urgently.</i>

795
01:15:21,046 --> 01:15:23,919
Darn it! I forgot to buy cigarettes.

796
01:15:24,268 --> 01:15:26,807
Can you handle being
alone for a little while?

797
01:15:26,832 --> 01:15:28,196
Are you going to Tigre?

798
01:15:28,221 --> 01:15:30,668
No, darling. Just to the lumberyard.

799
01:15:30,987 --> 01:15:32,973
I'll borrow a pack from old Lander.

800
01:15:34,754 --> 01:15:39,578
Lie down meanwhile. Tonight you'll
have dinner in bed. Like kids do.

801
01:18:31,885 --> 01:18:33,922
Why did you come here, Paulina?

802
01:18:35,008 --> 01:18:36,600
I wasn't going to kill you.

803
01:18:37,731 --> 01:18:39,168
I just wanted your money.

804
01:18:40,096 --> 01:18:42,162
I would have left without harming you.

805
01:18:46,912 --> 01:18:48,520
She was nosy too.

806
01:18:49,749 --> 01:18:52,396
She saw me that day
I scared you in the woods.

807
01:18:53,374 --> 01:18:56,602
And I couldn't let her... spoil my plan!

808
01:18:57,793 --> 01:18:59,403
She had understood everything!

809
01:19:00,918 --> 01:19:04,334
Later on...
I couldn't get her out of here.

810
01:19:05,268 --> 01:19:07,972
Because you didn't
want to be alone at night!

811
01:19:09,217 --> 01:19:11,681
I have no choice, Paulina.

812
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,266
It's useless to scream.

813
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:24,961
She screamed in vain too.

814
01:19:31,007 --> 01:19:32,462
I'm not scared.

815
01:19:33,052 --> 01:19:34,621
I don't care if you kill me!

816
01:19:36,180 --> 01:19:40,115
Today I found out I was married
to a scoundrel! But I wasn't scared.

817
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,992
Was I scared when
I put poison in your cup?

818
01:19:43,017 --> 01:19:46,166
Now you can kill me if you want!
You coward!

819
01:19:46,191 --> 01:19:51,502
I thought you'd die faster. But you
won't resist much after I'm dead.

820
01:19:51,527 --> 01:19:54,256
The poison will
destroy you little by little.

821
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,847
When you desperately cling to life,
you'll remember Agatha. And me!

822
01:19:58,872 --> 01:20:02,089
And all the poor women you deceived!

823
01:20:35,963 --> 01:20:37,779
He's there in the woodshed!

824
01:21:01,308 --> 01:21:03,508
I don't know how I managed to fool him.

825
01:21:05,372 --> 01:21:07,557
Mrs. Salcedo,
can you handle the speedboat?

826
01:21:07,582 --> 01:21:08,760
Yes, Mr. Casares.

827
01:21:08,785 --> 01:21:11,056
Take the lady and call my station.

828
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:15,110
What about you?

829
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,393
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

830
01:21:23,429 --> 01:21:24,877
Let's go ma'am.

831
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:27,652
No.

832
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,045
Paul Deval.

833
01:22:52,097 --> 01:22:55,384
This passport should clear up
many things. Did you get the ticket?

834
01:22:55,419 --> 01:22:56,219
Yes.

835
01:22:56,244 --> 01:22:58,727
The body shows no signs of poisoning.

836
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:01,806
If the young woman's
statement is true...

837
01:23:02,262 --> 01:23:05,846
lies are once again
the best female weapon.

838
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,862
It'll be easy to prove her innocence.

839
01:23:09,433 --> 01:23:13,611
Your testimony as regards Morán
strangling Miss Valle is precious.

840
01:23:13,636 --> 01:23:14,886
Poor woman.

841
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:20,046
When he said he had taken her
to the station, she was already dead.

842
01:23:20,071 --> 01:23:22,470
Should we take Mrs. Morán to Tigre?

843
01:23:23,326 --> 01:23:24,677
Yes. I'll handle it.

844
01:23:30,628 --> 01:23:36,340
Believe me, Torres. The weak
sex is the mightiest on the planet.

845
01:23:41,376 --> 01:23:45,871
<i>Paulina Figueroa is on her way,
perchance, to true happiness.</i>

846
01:23:46,712 --> 01:23:49,095
<i>But her sad story
will not be an exception...</i>

847
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,559
<i>as long as the lonely human beings...</i>

848
01:23:51,584 --> 01:23:53,108
<i>that await their fate...</i>

849
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:57,028
<i>lost in the cement jungle
of the big cities, exist.</i>

850
01:23:59,186 --> 01:24:03,540
52 year old WIDOWER, with own fortune,
wishes to meet a WIDOW under...

851
01:24:03,665 --> 01:24:07,297
