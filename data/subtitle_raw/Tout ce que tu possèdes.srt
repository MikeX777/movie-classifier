1
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:27,611
ALL THAT YOU POSSESS

2
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:13,551
This is where he threw himself under the train.

3
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,386
April 14, 1979.

4
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:18,180
He said the voices in his head

5
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,599
wouldn't let him leave the tracks.

6
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:25,396
It's a miracle he survived.

7
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:29,316
He sustained multiple injuries, and his right hand was shredded.

8
00:02:29,859 --> 00:02:31,819
When he woke up in the hospital,

9
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,529
he couldn't remember who he was.

10
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,198
Apparently, he was reciting French poetry.

11
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:42,329
He was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in Warsaw

12
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:45,207
and then went to live with his mother in the country.

13
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:50,170
That's where he wrote his book To Come to Terms with the World,

14
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:52,298
with his left hand, of course.

15
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,384
He never finished it.

16
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:58,345
One day...

17
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:02,182
he went to his apartment in Warsaw...

18
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,895
and hanged himself.

19
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,967
You've reached Pierre Leduc.

20
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,344
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.

21
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,791
"I FOUND MY DREAMS"

22
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,227
I FOUND MY DREAMS AGAIN

23
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:11,979
THE DREAMS I ONCE PUT

24
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:14,273
IN MY POCKET FULL OF HOLES

25
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,859
WHEN AT NIGHT AN ENORMOUS RAVEN

26
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,404
FLEW TO THE CLEAR RIVER, THE GOOD RIVER

27
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:30,706
That night bats devoured all the stars

28
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:34,126
White butterflies

29
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:37,171
Only black butterflies remained

30
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,175
Truth became like the moon

31
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:45,637
rolling over a smooth mirror for four weeks

32
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,118
So there you are.

33
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,623
Everybody's been looking for you all week.

34
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,292
I was in the country.

35
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,131
What are you doing?

36
00:06:21,465 --> 00:06:23,133
I'm leaving.

37
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,635
Where are you going?

38
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:26,595
Nowhere. Home.

39
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:29,723
I'm resigning.

40
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,974
What?

41
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,893
I'm leaving the university.

42
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:37,022
I've got a bunch of boxes. Can you give me a ride?

43
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,110
Will you finish your thesis?

44
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,654
What about your class?

45
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:45,322
They'll get a replacement.

46
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:47,074
A month before the term ends?

47
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:49,910
- Listen, I can't do this anymore. - Do what?

48
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,870
Any of it!

49
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,540
Teach students who can't read or write,

50
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,416
put up with faculty...

51
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,795
If I hear "collective agreement" or "lexical frequencies" once more,

52
00:06:59,837 --> 00:07:01,421
I'm going to hit someone.

53
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,137
This isn't a literature department, for Christ's sake.

54
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,972
It's an accounting firm.

55
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,608
Pierre, what's going on?

56
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,277
I don't know.

57
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,696
You could apply for sick leave.

58
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,489
I'm not sick.

59
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,121
"AUTUMN"

60
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,457
LOST, ENGULFED IN THE GARDENS OF RUST-RED AUTUMN

61
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,628
TEARING OFF THE LEAVES ONE BY ONE LIKE THE HOURS OF EXISTENCE

62
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,426
You've reached Pierre Leduc.

63
00:08:29,468 --> 00:08:32,012
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.

64
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:37,392
Pierre, it's your father.

65
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,937
I've been trying to reach you for a week.

66
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,773
Call me back. It's important. Goodbye.

67
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:14,638
Lost, engulfed

68
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,225
in the gardens of rust-red autumn

69
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:21,270
tearing off the leaves one by one

70
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,232
like the hours of existence

71
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,486
Going from tree to tree

72
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,698
from pain back to pain

73
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,743
A silent walk of suffering

74
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,247
that does not awaken the sleeping wind

75
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,168
Tearing off the leaves with no regret

76
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,963
with a sad, warm smile

77
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,549
Leaving the very last one

78
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,719
to someone else before dying

79
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,849
You're leaving?

80
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,650
You have no idea what this does to me.

81
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,324
You can't keep leaving and coming back.

82
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,620
This has to stop.

83
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,206
But you're my only friend.

84
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,588
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:36,780
Pierre!

86
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,324
Your father wants to see you.

87
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,034
Get in.

88
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,829
Get in!

89
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,049
Son of a bitch!

90
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,802
You knew the balcony wasn't safe!

91
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:01,680
A 5-year-old girl is in the hospital because of you!

92
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:05,267
She might not ever walk again! Look at me, Leduc!

93
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:08,520
If she doesn't get better, I'll see you in hell!

94
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,485
Hello, Pierre.

95
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,490
How's your mother?

96
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:24,619
How do you expect? Is that what you wanted to see me about?

97
00:12:26,955 --> 00:12:28,874
Would you like a coffee or something?

98
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,500
No, thanks.

99
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,961
Get me a scotch, would you?

100
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,845
Still at the university?

101
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,723
Yes.

102
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,933
Still lecturing?

103
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,852
Yes.

104
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,984
Have a seat.

105
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,958
Pierre, I'm dying. I have cancer.

106
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,503
It's spread everywhere.

107
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,089
The doctors don't give me three months.

108
00:13:18,632 --> 00:13:21,426
- There's nothing they can do? - Apparently not.

109
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,012
I'm sorry.

110
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,059
I'm leaving the company to you.

111
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,936
I don't want it.

112
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,231
You don't have to run it yourself.

113
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,317
It's awful what you're going through.

114
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,028
I'm sad for you. But I don't want that money.

115
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,156
- Why not? - Because it's dirty.

116
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,368
- What? - It's dirty money, Dad.

117
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,787
You've been screwing people over for 40 years.

118
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,331
You screwed your employees and your partners.

119
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,291
You bribed politicians.

120
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,628
You're a crook. You can't deny it.

121
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,548
Do you know how much it's worth?

122
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:00,966
I don't care.

123
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,426
Over $50 million.

124
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,388
Do whatever you want with it. It's yours.

125
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,931
I won't take it.

126
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:09,683
You're getting it anyway.

127
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:11,560
I won't take it.

128
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,438
THOSE LOST IN THE CITY JUNGLE -

129
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,982
THROUGH MY FAULT

130
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,359
THE HORROR OF A COLD EMBRACE -

131
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,860
THROUGH MY FAULT

132
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,363
THE LACK OF LOVE AND TENDERNESS -

133
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:24,948
THROUGH MY FAULT

134
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,453
HEARTLESS, PASSIONLESS

135
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,419
THROUGH MY FAULT

136
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:51,076
Hello.

137
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:53,411
I was in your class at university.

138
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,038
Were you?

139
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,291
Did they find someone to fill in?

140
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,627
Yeah, a McGill student.

141
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,296
Good.

142
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:06,091
Are you here to sell some books?

143
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,008
Yes.

144
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,638
Put them there.

145
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,153
We only accept French books.

146
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,198
Of course.

147
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,916
There are some real gems here.

148
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,251
Yeah.

149
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:46,256
What are you doing now?

150
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,008
Translating.

151
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,469
Translating what?

152
00:16:52,804 --> 00:16:55,348
Some poems by Edward Stachura.

153
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,058
I've never heard of him.

154
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:00,645
He had a huge youth following in Poland.

155
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,940
He sold 100,000 copies of his poetry collections.

156
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,067
He translated Gaston Miron.

157
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:08,778
Is he still alive?

158
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,490
He killed himself in 1979.

159
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:17,662
So why are you selling your books?

160
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,539
What's it to you?

161
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:22,459
I'm just curious.

162
00:17:24,753 --> 00:17:27,213
I need the room.

163
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:42,187
The barefoot in the streets of the world

164
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:45,648
The naked in the streets of the world

165
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,861
The hungry in the streets of the world

166
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,197
Through my fault

167
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,157
Through my fault

168
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,118
Through my most grievous fault!

169
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,290
Horror - there is no end to horror

170
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:06,085
Crime - there is no end to crime

171
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,215
War - there is no end to war

172
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:12,801
Through my fault

173
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:14,844
Through my fault

174
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,430
Through my most grievous fault!

175
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,344
Dad?

176
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,389
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

177
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,980
This was your great-grandfather's house.

178
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,982
You've never talked about him.

179
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:54,193
I was born here.

180
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,239
We lived with my grandparents.

181
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,575
The farm should've gone to my father,

182
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:03,912
but there was a fight and my grandfather kicked us out.

183
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,622
What was the fight about?

184
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,333
I don't really know.

185
00:20:10,418 --> 00:20:14,172
They probably didn't agree on how to manage the land.

186
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,299
My grandfather lost his temper.

187
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:21,846
My father had worked for him for free for 10 years.

188
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,184
There was nothing in writing.

189
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:30,063
My parents lost everything overnight.

190
00:20:30,313 --> 00:20:33,024
They already had four children by then.

191
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:36,778
We moved to Quebec City. Dad found work at the port.

192
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,364
He refused to ever set foot here again.

193
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,534
How old were you when you left?

194
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:45,328
Five.

195
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,709
When I heard the property was for sale, I bought it.

196
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,546
Life's funny, isn't it?

197
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,763
I got my lawyers to rezone the area.

198
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,391
We're turning it into a resort,

199
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,185
like the one on the other side of the river.

200
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:16,609
We just have to clear a few trees.

201
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,281
We'll have a great view of the St. Lawrence and the islands.

202
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,078
Why a vacation community?

203
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,165
We'll build about 50 cottages, scattered throughout the woods.

204
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,292
Not too close together.

205
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,504
And we'll keep as many trees as we can.

206
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:40,466
There'll be a community centre where the farm buildings are,

207
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:45,430
with a convenience store, a hall and a few guest rooms.

208
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,434
We'll keep the old exteriors intact,

209
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,102
wherever possible.

210
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,527
You never considered leaving it the way it was?

211
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:04,240
A piece of land like this? An hour and half away from the city?

212
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:07,118
If I don't do it, someone else will.

213
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:16,127
Anyway, when it's yours, you can do what you want with it.

214
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,337
I told you I won't take it.

215
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,719
It would be a nice place to write though.

216
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,346
You'd feel right at home in that little house.

217
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:36,522
My will is with Dutil & Associates on Grande-Allée.

218
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,733
Let it go, Dad.

219
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,820
It's a done deal.

220
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,907
There's nothing you can do about it.

221
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,701
You're my son.

222
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,412
It belongs to you.

223
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,299
THERE IS NO END TO THE CRYING - THROUGH MY FAULT

224
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,176
SOME COLLAPSE IN SILENCE - THROUGH MY FAULT

225
00:23:47,218 --> 00:23:49,303
WHILE OTHERS TURN THEIR BACKS - THROUGH MY FAULT

226
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,389
WITH MORE AND MORE PEOPLE AROUND - THROUGH MY FAULT

227
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,766
HUMAN BEINGS ARE MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT TO FIND

228
00:23:53,808 --> 00:23:55,309
THROUGH MY FAULT THROUGH MY FAULT

229
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:56,519
THROUGH MY MOST GRIEVOUS FAULT!

230
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,251
Hello, Denise.

231
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,798
We're here to see you.

232
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:31,929
Come here.

233
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,394
Come here, dear. Come see your mother.

234
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:58,849
Sorry. I can't do this.

235
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,413
Who's that?

236
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,967
LIKE A REGRET GUILTY OR INNOCENT

237
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:18,471
WE ARE ALIVE WHILE SO, SO, SO MANY ARE DEAD

238
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:21,932
LIKE A DRY SOB IN THE MIDST OF A RAINY NIGHT

239
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:35,821
LIKE A PERFECTLY INFLICTED WOUND THAT MUST BE LICKED

240
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:53,964
LIKE A PULVERIZED HEART THAT MUST BE MENDED

241
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:15,319
What else is there to say?

242
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,364
I'm leaving for Poland in August.

243
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:21,700
You're finishing your degree. Our options are limited.

244
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,745
And what's your solution?

245
00:28:24,787 --> 00:28:26,580
You can't keep it.

246
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,291
- You want me to have an abortion? - Yes.

247
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,962
It's your decision, obviously.

248
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:36,215
What do you want me to say?

249
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:38,259
I didn't make this baby on my own.

250
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,302
What do you want to do?

251
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:42,763
Drop out of school?

252
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:46,183
Sub at a high school to make ends meet?

253
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:48,519
For a baby we never even wanted?

254
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,689
How do you know I don't want it?

255
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,732
Do what you like, but I don't want kids.

256
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:56,569
- Not now, not ever. - It's a bit late now.

257
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,112
You can't force a baby on me!

258
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:00,781
I'm not forcing anything on you. You made this baby.

259
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,284
How can I even be sure I'm the father?

260
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:25,014
MY SEARCH ENGINE

261
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:28,976
GOVERNMENT OF QUEBEC STAFF DIRECTORY ONE NAME FOUND

262
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,358
Hello?

263
00:29:36,859 --> 00:29:38,569
Yes, speaking.

264
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:44,867
I'm on my way.

265
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,588
Sir?

266
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,049
You're Mr. Leduc's son?

267
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,800
Yes.

268
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:06,138
Your father has had a severe stroke. The clot originated in his
heart.

269
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,893
He has end-stage cancer?

270
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,729
Yes.

271
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,442
Under the circumstances, if he does regain consciousness...

272
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,488
his body and mind will be severely damaged.

273
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:27,743
So we can keep him on artificial life support,

274
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:32,331
or let nature take its course and make sure he's not in any pain.

275
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:36,752
Are you his next of kin?

276
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:37,962
Yes.

277
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:41,715
What do you think?

278
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:47,137
Let him go.

279
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:56,855
I was 12 when my parents split up.

280
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,567
My mother suffered from depression. She drank.

281
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:02,987
He left when things started to get really bad.

282
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:05,531
She couldn't take care of me.

283
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,033
I went to live with my aunt Françoise.

284
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:11,620
Once a year, he would take me to a Nordiques game.

285
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:15,624
Then he'd give me $100 and he'd be gone for another year.

286
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,043
Did you miss him?

287
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:23,048
I don't know why, but I just couldn't hate him.

288
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,927
He thought he was a good man, and in a way he was.

289
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,890
He was generous, when it suited him.

290
00:31:33,601 --> 00:31:36,020
But deep down, he was just a scam artist.

291
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,191
He was cold-blooded.

292
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:44,820
He'd put a family out on the street, like that.

293
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:47,781
But I know he helped plenty of people out of a bind.

294
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:50,868
Go figure.

295
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,162
When did you stop seeing him?

296
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:56,457
When I was 18.

297
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:02,046
That's the summer I went to work for him in his office.

298
00:32:02,546 --> 00:32:05,090
For six weeks, I mailed out letters

299
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,218
threatening tenants who were behind on their rent

300
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,430
and promising repairs that never got done.

301
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:15,976
I quit before the end of the summer. I'd had it.

302
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:17,978
He was furious.

303
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:23,233
When I told him I was going to study literature,

304
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,735
he said I was on my own.

305
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:27,196
He wouldn't waste his money on such nonsense.

306
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,659
I didn't see him again until I got back from Poland.

307
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,369
You're the one who called him?

308
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,870
Yeah.

309
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:41,627
He pretended like nothing happened and gave me tickets to a show.

310
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:43,962
Nana Mouskouri, for Christ's sake!

311
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,261
Your mother...

312
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,181
did he take care of her?

313
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:58,185
He paid the bills. That's it.

314
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,438
I don't think he ever went to see her.

315
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:42,813
Right now, you're worth about $53 million.

316
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:46,191
Your father said you would waive the inheritance.

317
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,235
You have six months to do that.

318
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,779
But first, listen to me.

319
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,323
- Mr. Dutil- - Let me finish.

320
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,745
You've become a millionaire without lifting a finger.

321
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:00,706
You have no idea what went into building this fortune.

322
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,792
And you despise the people behind it.

323
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,547
Do you want the truth, Pierre?

324
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,175
You're an unremarkable man,

325
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,178
even after spending half your life buried in books.

326
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:18,098
Listen up.

327
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,769
I know you've left the university.

328
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:24,730
You're out of work. You're in debt.

329
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,691
A miracle just fell into your lap.

330
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:30,277
A miracle isn't something you can turn down.

331
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:33,906
If you're not interested in running the company,

332
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,991
we can do that on your behalf.

333
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,202
You don't like thinking about money?

334
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,247
With $50 million, you'll never have to think about it again.

335
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,919
You want to move to the country and read for the rest of your life?

336
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,545
No problem.

337
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:52,216
Feel like moving to Paris? Go right ahead.

338
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,844
Or flying off to Venice for the weekend?

339
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:58,263
Call the travel agent.

340
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:02,100
Freedom, Pierre...

341
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:07,439
Do you know how much freedom $50 million buys?

342
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,277
Now, come with me.

343
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,037
We built this on land nobody else wanted.

344
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:26,625
Look at it now: 300 stores, all high-end,

345
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:31,129
100% occupancy, parking for 5,000,

346
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:33,340
packed with people all the time.

347
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:36,635
Your father had to talk the first investors into it.

348
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,972
They've never regretted it, trust me.

349
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,810
And here, 120 people get a steady paycheque because of us.

350
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:48,063
Carpenters, painters, electricians...

351
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:51,358
That's food on 120 tables because of the jobs we created.

352
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,862
Let's go look at the model unit.

353
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,497
Your father built this.

354
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:08,834
The most luxurious apartments in Quebec City.

355
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,004
An incredible view of the Plains of Abraham.

356
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:17,301
Do you want to see the bachelor unit on the ninth floor?

357
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,970
Another time. I'm going home.

358
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:22,639
- Want a drive? - No, thanks. I'll walk.

359
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,182
Pierre...

360
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:29,187
Give this some serious thought. You know where to find me.

361
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,217
like a dry sob in the midst of a rainy night

362
00:37:00,928 --> 00:37:05,307
a heavy block of stone, a block of stone

363
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,395
I will stand on it, it will crush me

364
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:15,359
it will crush me, I will rise from underneath

365
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,403
That comes to $137.50.

366
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,197
I can double that if you take it in store credit.

367
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,533
I'd like it in cash, please.

368
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:09,079
Fill this out. I need your address and signature.

369
00:38:20,132 --> 00:38:21,508
Thank you.

370
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,810
Mr. Leduc?

371
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:37,149
A lot of us students enjoyed your class.

372
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,444
You... I don't know how to put this.

373
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,864
You made literature seem important.

374
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,616
Thank you.

375
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,838
Sir!

376
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:02,419
What is it?

377
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,713
You recognized my mother the other day.

378
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,548
I don't remember.

379
00:41:07,007 --> 00:41:09,801
I do. You recognized her and then you looked at me.

380
00:41:10,302 --> 00:41:13,180
I told you I don't remember. What do you want?

381
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,598
Are you my father?

382
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,601
- That's ridiculous. - Then say no.

383
00:41:19,019 --> 00:41:20,896
But you knew my mother?

384
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,440
I don't know who you mean. Leave me alone.

385
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,774
Why did you run away?

386
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,402
I didn't run away. I was in a hurry.

387
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,654
So you recognized me?

388
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:32,240
How many times do I have to say no?

389
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:34,409
Now get lost! I've got work to do.

390
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:54,698
LIKE A DRY SOB IN THE MIDST OF A RAINY NIGHT

391
00:42:54,739 --> 00:42:57,617
LIKE A GOLDEN SPHERE OVER THE WATERS

392
00:42:57,659 --> 00:42:59,786
LIKE DAWN UNDER SWOLLEN EYELIDS

393
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,664
LIKE LOVELY AURORAS, BEAUTIFUL GLADES

394
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:26,099
LIKE A DRY SOB IN THE MIDST OF A RAINY NIGHT...

395
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:12,812
Come here.

396
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:21,488
Hold on.

397
00:46:33,875 --> 00:46:35,210
Sit down.

398
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:42,008
Did your mother tell you who I was?

399
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:45,595
Has she ever talked about me?

400
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,266
I didn't even know your name until yesterday.

401
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:52,477
The girl at the bookstore told me.

402
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,187
That's how you found me.

403
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:55,271
Yes.

404
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,857
What's your name?

405
00:46:57,899 --> 00:46:59,317
Adèle.

406
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,902
Adèle Genest?

407
00:47:01,611 --> 00:47:02,862
Yes.

408
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,323
How old are you, Adèle?

409
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,201
You should know, Mr. Leduc.

410
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:10,703
You don't have to call me that.

411
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:14,832
So you're 12?

412
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,543
Thirteen.

413
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:22,173
Why did you leave my mother?

414
00:47:22,924 --> 00:47:24,759
Do you really want to know?

415
00:47:24,801 --> 00:47:26,219
Yes.

416
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,598
We met at university.

417
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,892
We dated for six months.

418
00:47:33,184 --> 00:47:35,270
I got a scholarship to study in Poland.

419
00:47:35,311 --> 00:47:38,231
That's when your mother told me she was pregnant.

420
00:47:38,773 --> 00:47:40,358
Then what?

421
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,985
Then...

422
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:55,999
I told her I didn't want children and I was leaving for Warsaw.

423
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,875
Just like that?

424
00:47:58,167 --> 00:47:59,961
Just like that.

425
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:05,008
I left. I never called.

426
00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:06,884
Neither did she.

427
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:09,887
I spent five years in Poland.

428
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,140
When I got back, I didn't look her up.

429
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:13,725
Why not?

430
00:48:16,185 --> 00:48:17,979
Why didn't you look her up?

431
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:24,193
I thought having a child would keep me from doing what I wanted.

432
00:48:26,863 --> 00:48:30,408
You never felt bad that she was stuck raising me on her own?

433
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:34,120
Do you want the truth?

434
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,080
Yeah.

435
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:40,668
The truth is I thought about it as little as possible.

436
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,089
What about now?

437
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:49,052
Now, here you are.

438
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:12,992
Where do you live?

439
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,328
Sainte-Foy.

440
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:21,000
Can I come back another time?

441
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,670
Sure.

442
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:27,423
- My number's in the phonebook. - I know.

443
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:36,015
- Bye. - Bye.

444
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,798
You're late.

445
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,008
Sorry.

446
00:50:54,886 --> 00:50:56,637
What are you reading?

447
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:59,557
A Harlot High and Low, by Balzac.

448
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:02,518
The sequel to Lost Illusions.

449
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,061
I know.

450
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:07,023
- You've read them? - Yeah.

451
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,193
Is it for school?

452
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,613
What's so funny?

453
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:17,074
I don't think the nuns would find this age-appropriate.

454
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:20,119
At the Ursulines' school?

455
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:21,412
Yeah.

456
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,415
Which grade?

457
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:26,209
Grade 8.

458
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:27,835
Are you a good student?

459
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,504
Yeah.

460
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,130
Do you like school?

461
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:34,592
Let's talk about something else.

462
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:37,303
All right.

463
00:51:40,223 --> 00:51:41,974
What do you teach?

464
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,939
Did the young lady at the bookstore tell you I teach?

465
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,357
Yeah.

466
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,528
Actually, I don't teach anymore.

467
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:57,114
I wasn't a professor.

468
00:51:57,156 --> 00:51:59,325
I was a lecturer. Do you know what that is?

469
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,785
Yeah.

470
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:03,287
What did you teach?

471
00:52:03,913 --> 00:52:05,748
Literature.

472
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:11,128
Mostly Eastern European literature: Polish, Czech, Russian.

473
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,922
You speak all those languages?

474
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:16,384
I speak Polish and Russian and a bit of Czech.

475
00:52:18,761 --> 00:52:20,888
What are you doing now?

476
00:52:21,722 --> 00:52:23,599
I'm translating poetry.

477
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,227
What kind of poetry?

478
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:29,230
Polish poetry.

479
00:52:31,858 --> 00:52:33,693
I like novels better.

480
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,811
What time do you have to be home by?

481
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:10,271
7:00.

482
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,858
I told my mom I was doing homework at a girlfriend's house.

483
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,776
She won't be home anyway.

484
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:18,279
Does she work late?

485
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:20,364
She works all the time.

486
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,366
What does she do?

487
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:25,661
She's a divisional manager with the government.

488
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,044
Does anyone else live with you?

489
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,298
My mom has a boyfriend, but he's married.

490
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:42,678
Is she still pretty?

491
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,974
You saw her. I guess she's pretty, in her way.

492
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:50,144
- What way is that? - Dull.

493
00:53:51,187 --> 00:53:53,272
What do you mean "dull"?

494
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:57,151
Someone who always makes sure her purse matches her shoes.

495
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:59,695
That's not your style?

496
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,238
Not really.

497
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,531
Why not?

498
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:06,535
Stop asking stupid questions, OK?

499
00:54:19,131 --> 00:54:22,218
You have to tell your mother you found me.

500
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,011
There's no hurry.

501
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:26,222
I can do it if you don't want to.

502
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:31,310
We don't have much of a choice.

503
00:54:31,352 --> 00:54:33,521
She'll go crazy.

504
00:54:33,562 --> 00:54:35,356
How do you know that?

505
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,317
I just know. It's better if we wait.

506
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:40,277
What will that change?

507
00:54:41,821 --> 00:54:43,572
Let me handle this, OK?

508
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:51,956
School's out next week.

509
00:54:51,998 --> 00:54:54,291
Can I still come over?

510
00:54:57,044 --> 00:55:00,297
A few afternoons a week, just to read. I won't bother you.

511
00:55:16,397 --> 00:55:17,606
Bye.

512
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,901
Bye.

513
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:28,993
"SANCTUS"

514
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:32,538
HOLY BREAD - BREAD FOR SHARING HOLY SALT - SALT FOR GREETING

515
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:34,457
HOLY SILENCE, HOLY SINGING

516
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:36,751
LABORIOUS BEATING OF RIGHTEOUS HEARTS

517
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:12,703
EYES FROZEN IN WONDER

518
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,464
EYELIDS FLUTTERING IN SURPRISE

519
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:50,324
- What have you been up to? - Translating.

520
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:53,452
- Still Stachura? - Still Stachura.

521
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:57,706
I don't know why you keep at it.

522
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:01,961
Who'll read a Québécois translation of an obscure Polish poet?

523
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:03,838
Nobody will publish it.

524
00:57:03,879 --> 00:57:05,631
But he's a great poet.

525
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:09,260
So read him in Polish. You don't have to translate him.

526
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,639
You're in a strange mood today.

527
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:25,234
Anne...

528
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,113
I have a 13-year-old daughter. She tracked me down.

529
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:30,447
What?

530
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,491
Her name is Adèle.

531
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,661
I left her mother when she was pregnant.

532
00:57:35,703 --> 00:57:37,746
How did she find you?

533
00:57:38,998 --> 00:57:40,291
By chance.

534
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,043
What's she like?

535
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,753
She's...

536
00:57:46,422 --> 00:57:47,965
She's tall.

537
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,968
She's got light brown hair, a braid.

538
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,805
I don't know. I don't know anything about kids.

539
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:56,098
She reads Balzac.

540
00:57:56,974 --> 00:57:58,976
So she's like you?

541
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:01,228
I don't know. A little, I guess.

542
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:03,230
Are you going to see her again?

543
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,815
Yes.

544
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,156
Have you talked to her mother?

545
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:13,824
Not yet.

546
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,994
I don't think she knows.

547
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,418
This is a small place.

548
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:26,545
It's big enough for me.

549
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,505
Don't you have a girlfriend?

550
00:58:30,341 --> 00:58:32,426
Are you alone all the time?

551
00:58:32,468 --> 00:58:34,553
No, I have friends like everyone else.

552
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,650
Do you have the whole Human Comedy?

553
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:49,360
Yes.

554
00:58:49,401 --> 00:58:50,819
Have you read them all?

555
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,738
Almost.

556
00:58:53,614 --> 00:58:55,532
Can I borrow them?

557
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:58,619
If you like, but you might get bored.

558
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:01,330
They're not all as good as Lost Illusions.

559
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,385
Who's that?

560
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:17,429
Edward Stachura. A Polish writer.

561
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:19,306
I'm translating his poetry.

562
00:59:19,348 --> 00:59:21,725
- Is that his handwriting? - Yes.

563
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:25,104
It's the last poem he wrote before he died.

564
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:27,606
It's called "A Letter to the Remaining".

565
00:59:27,648 --> 00:59:29,733
What does it say?

566
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,612
It's a sort of goodbye letter.

567
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,573
He knew he was going to die?

568
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:39,076
Yes.

569
00:59:39,118 --> 00:59:40,786
Did you translate it?

570
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:45,249
Not yet. If you like, I can read you another one.

571
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,002
- Sure. - Come here.

572
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:06,020
All that you possess

573
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:08,063
Will one day be lost

574
01:00:08,689 --> 01:00:11,066
This you will find out Sooner or later

575
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,027
Slowly or suddenly

576
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:15,487
Not necessarily with pain -

577
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:18,198
Loss can be free of pain

578
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,701
And even full of joy -

579
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:24,538
The Obvious will illuminate you:

580
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,750
That you have never been compelled to possess a thing

581
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,461
Since everything has been given to us

582
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,713
Our body, the earth

583
01:00:32,755 --> 01:00:35,132
And all the living things on earth

584
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:36,425
The sky

585
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,677
and all the living things in the sky

586
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:41,096
The only thing we can possess is unhappiness

587
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,474
Even though it is not real

588
01:00:43,724 --> 01:00:46,727
Know that There is no real unhappiness!

589
01:00:46,769 --> 01:00:48,937
Only happiness is real

590
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,231
But there is no need to possess happiness

591
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:53,442
Happiness is us!

592
01:01:07,331 --> 01:01:09,958
We found some empty bottles on her night table.

593
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,545
Phenobarbital, Valium, Percodan...

594
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,382
Yes.

595
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,009
Right.

596
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:41,240
When did she start drinking?

597
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,783
Yesterday.

598
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,369
You should've called me.

599
01:01:53,877 --> 01:01:55,421
Have you made up your mind?

600
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:56,755
Yes.

601
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:02,010
I'll accept the inheritance, subject to an inventory.

602
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,846
Once that's done,

603
01:02:03,887 --> 01:02:06,890
I want you to set up a trust for my mother,

604
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:08,684
then sell off everything else,

605
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,894
except for the property in Saint-Pacôme.

606
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:15,357
Donate whatever's left to the Red Cross.

607
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:16,775
All of it?

608
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:18,944
That's what I said.

609
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:21,071
You're crazier than I thought.

610
01:02:21,363 --> 01:02:22,948
That's entirely possible.

611
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,743
I want it to be an anonymous donation.

612
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:28,787
Whatever you say.

613
01:02:30,164 --> 01:02:32,207
For the property in Saint-Pacôme,

614
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:35,377
please have the keys to the house sent to me.

615
01:02:35,419 --> 01:02:37,045
Do you plan on keeping it?

616
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,381
I don't know yet.

617
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:07,075
Are those your grandparents?

618
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:08,827
I don't think so.

619
01:03:09,328 --> 01:03:11,747
My great-grandparents maybe.

620
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:27,930
Was this where they slept?

621
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,433
Probably.

622
01:03:31,934 --> 01:03:34,102
Where did my grandfather sleep?

623
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:36,188
Upstairs, I imagine.

624
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:38,649
Can I go see?

625
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:39,858
Sure.

626
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:53,121
Did he have any brothers or sisters?

627
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,540
Yes.

628
01:03:56,291 --> 01:03:58,001
Do you still see them?

629
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,420
My aunts and uncles, you mean?

630
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:01,922
Yeah.

631
01:04:04,091 --> 01:04:05,717
Why not?

632
01:04:06,176 --> 01:04:08,804
I never really knew my father's family.

633
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,766
Not even your grandparents?

634
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:14,643
Not even.

635
01:04:17,229 --> 01:04:20,566
Didn't your dad take you to see them when you were little?

636
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,443
Not that I remember.

637
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:42,588
Can we go see the barn?

638
01:04:43,005 --> 01:04:44,089
Sure.

639
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,327
Come see!

640
01:05:20,334 --> 01:05:21,877
Look.

641
01:05:23,837 --> 01:05:26,048
Is that my great-grandfather?

642
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,591
Probably.

643
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:30,927
Come here. I want to show you something.

644
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:02,000
That's Charlevoix on the other side.

645
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:04,628
Over there is La Malbaie.

646
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,050
Are you going to come live here?

647
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:16,139
I don't know.

648
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,187
It's nice.

649
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:25,482
It is nice.

650
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,170
"HAIR"

651
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,213
THE RIVER FLOWS BETWEEN THE EYES OF THE FISH

652
01:07:30,255 --> 01:07:32,507
LIKE A RAINBOW OR THE UNHEALED CUT OF A KNIFE

653
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:34,968
FLOATING ON THE SURFACE ARE ENORMOUS BAOBAB TRUNKS

654
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:36,386
WAGON WHEELS

655
01:07:36,428 --> 01:07:38,764
AND HEAVY CANDELABRAS MADE OF THE ANTLERS OF DROWNED DEER

656
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:41,099
MY TEARS LIKE SHATTERED FRAGMENTS OF FINE CHINA

657
01:07:41,141 --> 01:07:42,184
SINK SLOWLY IN A SWIRL

658
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,411
What's going on?

659
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:03,205
Can I sleep here?

660
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,748
What's going on?

661
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,042
Nothing. I just want to sleep here.

662
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,131
What about your mom?

663
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:15,175
I said I was staying at a friend's.

664
01:08:15,217 --> 01:08:17,177
No. That's not right, Adèle.

665
01:08:17,219 --> 01:08:19,262
It's midnight. Call your mother.

666
01:08:20,222 --> 01:08:22,140
Then I will. Give me the number.

667
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,392
Adèle, give me her number.

668
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,144
Get it yourself.

669
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:30,649
What's gotten into you? Did you two have a fight?

670
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,195
Tell me what's going on.

671
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:38,615
The government offered her a job in New York.

672
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:40,617
She's moving there in August.

673
01:08:41,618 --> 01:08:44,371
What do you mean "she"? Aren't you going with her?

674
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,751
Boarding school?

675
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,173
You don't want to go. Is that it?

676
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,302
Well, then...

677
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:02,180
Call her, and I'll take you home.

678
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,477
Listen, Adèle. You can't stay here.

679
01:09:07,519 --> 01:09:10,480
Your mother must be upset. Maybe she called the police.

680
01:09:10,522 --> 01:09:12,190
Call and say you're coming.

681
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:14,359
So you want to get rid of me?

682
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:18,530
That's not fair, and you know it.

683
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,122
Here.

684
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,833
Adèle, you have no choice. Call.

685
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,348
Hi, Mom?

686
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:48,643
It's me. I'll be home in 15 minutes. Bye.

687
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:53,732
You'll never see me again.

688
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:18,089
Go to your room.

689
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:37,734
Now!

690
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:41,297
- Hello? - Hello, Adèle?

691
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:44,175
Adèle?

692
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:03,570
You've reached 694-3244.

693
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:06,031
Leave us a message after the beep.

694
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:11,119
Adèle, I want to talk to you. Call me back, please.

695
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:02,420
Nicole Genest, please.

696
01:13:02,462 --> 01:13:04,047
Do you have an appointment?

697
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:07,675
- Your name, please? - Pierre Leduc.

698
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,011
One moment, I'll call her secretary.

699
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,398
The line's busy.

700
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:26,277
Please have a seat. Someone will come get you.

701
01:13:54,556 --> 01:13:55,807
Nicole!

702
01:13:55,849 --> 01:13:58,685
We have to talk. Just give me a minute.

703
01:13:59,394 --> 01:14:01,062
I can't change the past.

704
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,106
But please let me see her.

705
01:14:03,148 --> 01:14:04,357
She doesn't want to.

706
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:06,651
- I don't know what you told her. - The truth!

707
01:14:06,693 --> 01:14:09,445
But if she wants to see me, you'll let her?

708
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:12,240
Listen, Pierre. I've talked to a lawyer.

709
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,993
You have no rights when it comes to her.

710
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,370
Until she turns 18, you need my consent,

711
01:14:17,412 --> 01:14:18,663
and you won't get it.

712
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:20,415
You can file for paternity.

713
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:22,584
I won't help, but you might get it.

714
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,377
Then, if she wants to,

715
01:14:24,419 --> 01:14:27,213
I'll let her see you with a social worker present.

716
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:30,175
But with us living in the US, it might get complicated.

717
01:14:30,216 --> 01:14:32,677
Now leave me alone! I'm late for something.

718
01:14:40,185 --> 01:14:42,145
Château Frontenac, please.

719
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:51,571
DEAR ADÈLE, I...

720
01:14:57,702 --> 01:15:00,038
PLEASE WRITE BACK.

721
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,583
YOUR FATHER, PIERRE.

722
01:15:19,098 --> 01:15:21,601
FORGIVE ME. P.

723
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:30,545
You've reached 694-3244.

724
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,839
Leave us a message after the beep.

725
01:17:03,411 --> 01:17:05,538
- Hello? - Adèle?

726
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,625
It's me. I want to talk to you.

727
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:12,211
You wanted me to be aborted. Leave me alone.

728
01:17:12,253 --> 01:17:13,629
Adèle?

729
01:17:17,592 --> 01:17:19,761
I never want to see you again. Got it?

730
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:01,636
"A LETTER TO THE REMAINING"

731
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:05,807
I AM DYING

732
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:12,397
FOR MY GUILT AND MY INNOCENCE

733
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:26,953
FOR THE ABSENCE I FEEL IN EVERY INCH OF MY BODY

734
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,667
AND SOUL

735
01:18:37,171 --> 01:18:41,551
FOR THE ABSENCE THAT TEARS ME TO SHREDS

736
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,142
I am dying

737
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:52,812
for my guilt and my innocence

738
01:18:53,813 --> 01:18:58,860
for the absence I feel in every inch of my body and soul

739
01:19:00,820 --> 01:19:04,323
for the absence that tears me to shreds

740
01:19:04,365 --> 01:19:07,493
like a newspaper full of loud

741
01:19:08,035 --> 01:19:10,079
yet empty words

742
01:19:11,289 --> 01:19:15,793
for a chance to unite with the Nameless

743
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:21,048
the Otherworldly and the Unknown

744
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,803
for a new day

745
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:28,723
for a sweet escape

746
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,185
for a magnificent view

747
01:19:32,727 --> 01:19:35,104
for a real illusion

748
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:39,025
for the dot over Ypsilon

749
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,195
for the mystery of death

750
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:54,327
That's all. There's nothing left.

751
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:57,246
Except Saint-Pacôme.

752
01:21:57,538 --> 01:21:59,248
Except Saint-Pacôme.

753
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:03,169
What are you going to do now?

754
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,588
I don't know.

755
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:09,175
Well, good luck.

756
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,010
There is one more thing.

757
01:22:11,052 --> 01:22:15,097
I'd like to prepare a declaration of paternity and a will.

758
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,058
You have a child?

759
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:18,517
A daughter.

760
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,103
Do you want to do this right away?

761
01:22:22,021 --> 01:22:23,648
Yes.

762
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,817
I'll need to find some witnesses.

763
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:29,445
I have all the time in the world.

764
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,888
Pierre!

765
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,022
You've reached Pierre Leduc.

766
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:30,566
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.

767
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,546
Dear Adèle...

768
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,925
All my life, I've isolated myself from the world.

769
01:26:20,593 --> 01:26:23,220
But when you found me, you showed me

770
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:27,182
that life is meaningless if you're not connected to others.

771
01:26:30,603 --> 01:26:32,980
I didn't want you to be born.

772
01:26:33,314 --> 01:26:38,277
But now, I can't imagine a world without you in it.

773
01:26:41,155 --> 01:26:42,781
You are here now.

774
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:46,201
And that's really all that matters.

775
01:26:46,994 --> 01:26:50,122
You are here now, and, no matter what,

776
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,708
I'll always be here for you.

777
01:26:56,170 --> 01:26:58,297
I left the city.

778
01:26:58,797 --> 01:27:01,216
I walked all the way to Saint-Pacôme.

779
01:27:02,676 --> 01:27:06,347
I slept on the floor in the house that belonged to our ancestors

780
01:27:06,388 --> 01:27:08,724
and I've decided to stay.

781
01:27:11,018 --> 01:27:12,686
I'll be here.

782
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:17,441
This house is your house.

783
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:21,278
Your father, Pierre.
