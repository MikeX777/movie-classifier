1
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,108
But as Aristotle says:

2
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:30,988
From the poetic point of view,
the persuasive impossible is preferable

3
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:35,993
to the non-persuasive possible.

4
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,038
So it's not just a feature
of contemporary aesthetics

5
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:42,792
to play on the borderline
between reality and fiction,

6
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,877
which leads me at last
to the next question,

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,004
didn't every period develop

8
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,048
its own modes of hybridization?

9
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:53,803
The one who'd answer yes
risks knocking on an open door.

10
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:58,057
That's my feeling. We seem
to be running late...

11
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,143
<i>So I'm moving quickly to
this week's new releases.</i>

12
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>I've selected three...</i>

13
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,606
- You think he liked it?
- I'm sure. Relax.

14
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:09,860
Interiors, by Jean-Rachid Choukri.

15
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,947
A huis clos serving as the pretext
for stunning reflections

16
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,200
<i>on the fragilization
of collective identities...</i>

17
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:19,078
A bit more academic,
but not without interest,

18
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:21,872
Oblivion, by Constance Duplere...

19
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,250
Let's hope this title
won't be premonitory

20
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,085
because the author
deserves better.

21
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:29,630
And finally, The Bathtub
by Frederic Koska.

22
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,011
We'll talk about it next week.
Sorry, we're live.

23
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:38,389
<i>Have to yield to the next program.</i>
- I can't believe he did that!

24
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,892
<i>See you again next week. Until
then, I wish you pleasant reading.</i>

25
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,981
You don't need a good TV critique
for your book to sell.

26
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,067
Trust me.

27
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:51,861
It will sell.

28
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,575
237 copies later.

29
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:08,169
What are you thinking about?

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,551
You must have loads of unsold copies
of The Bathtub left.

31
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,556
- When will they go to the shredder?
- Don't worry. Not right away.

32
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:24,310
- They'll let you know in advance.
- Why?

33
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,771
In case I'd like to witness
the murder of my work?

34
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,231
- But it's a beautiful death.
- Sure.

35
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:35,279
Broken, torn, shredded?
It'll be awesome. All of it.

36
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,741
No! They'll be recycled
to make new books.

37
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,868
It's like a reincarnation.

38
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:43,663
I hope you won't send me
to the shredder as well.

39
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:44,872
Silly.

40
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:01,931
Hello.

41
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,559
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, thanks.

42
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,104
But I was working.

43
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:11,482
I mean, I didn't wake up just now.

44
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,277
For all I care, you can sleep
until noon if you want to.

45
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,488
That's what's good about your job.
No regular hours.

46
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,365
Stop teasing him, Dad!

47
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:21,742
- Working on the next book?
- Yes.

48
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:25,496
Is it true, it's like a parachute jump?
The second is the hardest.

49
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,040
I've no idea. I never did
a parachute jump.

50
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,795
Make sure you don't screw up this one.

51
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,882
I mean, The Bathtub was good
but a bit too claustrophobic.

52
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,927
At some point, one wishes
the guy'd get out of the bathtub.

53
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,555
Yes. I thought about it.
But I didn't do it.

54
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,014
- Too bad.
- Dad!

55
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,767
I did what I could. I put it
in the bookstore.

56
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,019
But I can't force people to buy it.

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,896
- Dad!
- Thanks anyway, Gerard.

58
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,481
My pleasure, Fred!

59
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,987
The Old Bedsheets.
By Damien Boulard.

60
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,614
- That Boulard really got to you?
- I don't know.

61
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:04,410
I must've done something
to his ancestors in a previous life

62
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,287
so now he tries to kill me
with boredom.

63
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:07,663
Really that bad?

64
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,915
It's you who'll tell the poor guy
he's been rejected?

65
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,626
No, an intern will send him
a formal letter.

66
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,420
Yes, that famous letter.

67
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,005
"After reading your manuscript,"

68
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,758
"we suggest you change your job ASAP,"

69
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:21,761
"in order to maintain the mental health
of our reading committee,"

70
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,221
"and for the good of
all of the humanity."

71
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,767
There's a man here who had
a funny idea a few years ago.

72
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,393
The librarian from Crozon.

73
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,564
He decided to collect all the
manuscripts refused by publishers.

74
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:36,108
- Original, right?
- Great idea!

75
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,110
A library of rejected books.

76
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,988
- Is this library still there?
- I think so.

77
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,365
Let's go there tomorrow.
I'd really like to see it.

78
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,744
Right now, I'm not really into
rejected books.

79
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,371
Maybe it's contagious, who knows?

80
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,332
But I'm really interested.

81
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:17,483
Hello. I'm looking for
the rejected books room.

82
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,246
It doesn't work. Anyway, nobody
comes here anymore.

83
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,707
- Well, I'll leave you here.
- Thanks.

84
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,763
MASTURBATION AND SUSHI
by Sarah Dechamps.

85
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,940
CAVIAR FOR THE BRAVE ONES
by Milan Ertaci.

86
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,262
THE LAST HOURS OF
A LOVE STORY by Henri Pick.

87
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:50,117
- Well?
- I feel like killing myself.

88
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,871
But you don't know
the craziest part.

89
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,499
The author, Henri Pick, was
a local guy. He owned a pizzeria.

90
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,751
Oh really?

91
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:02,212
Writer and pizza-maker.
Works well together.

92
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,090
Dad, do you know
where I can find Henri Pick?

93
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,260
At the cemetery.

94
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,513
He died 2 or 3 years ago.
Madeleine, his wife, is still alive. Why?

95
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,141
Because I'm gonna publish
her husband's book.

96
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,354
Frankly, I doubt it. I can't
imagine Henri writing a book.

97
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,440
Maybe he just didn't dare
to tell you about it.

98
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,735
- But what is it? Recipes?
- No.

99
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:26,820
It's a novel.

100
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,491
It's a love story set against
the backdrop of Pushkin's death.

101
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,243
- Who?
- Pushkin, the Russian poet.

102
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,873
Look, Madeleine.
You'd better read it.

103
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,377
I'm sure you'll recognize
your husband's voice.

104
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,755
To M.

105
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,487
It's very beautiful indeed.

106
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,867
But why would he hide it from us?

107
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:18,706
Maybe he lacked self-confidence
and underestimated his talent.

108
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,501
Really, can you see Dad writing
between two loads of pizza?

109
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:28,382
Can you imagine him philosophizing
about Pushkin? Dad and Pushkin?

110
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:36,181
- And all the sex scenes...
- You know, beneath his modest exterior,

111
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,142
your father was...

112
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,060
OK, let's talk about it
some other time.

113
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,272
- But I'm interested...
- Finish your chocolate, dear.

114
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,775
And this library...
Doesn't that surprise you?

115
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,279
I doubt he even knew that
there was one in Crozon.

116
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:54,533
Maybe he left the novel for us,
to remember him by.

117
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,915
Where's his stuff?

118
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,897
PUSHKIN EUGENE ONEGIN

119
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,411
"Happiness was so near,
so possible..."

120
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,651
THE MYSTERY OF HENRI PICK

121
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,794
Wendy, how many times must
I ask you to number the cards?

122
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:14,423
As a college graduate, you can
surely count to 10?

123
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,924
OK, Jean-Michel.

124
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,927
- Here.
- Thanks a lot.

125
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,682
There's a whistling noise.
It's stressful.

126
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,017
Let me see.

127
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,061
I hear nothing.

128
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,647
Of course. How long have
you been on this job?

129
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,483
40 years? It's normal. See you.

130
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,904
- Shall we?
- Hello, Jean-Michel.

131
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,655
Everybody's here. Let's roll.

132
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,741
- 20 seconds.
- Jean-Michel, do you hear me?

133
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,910
- Yes, I hear you.
- So, Madeleine Pick.

134
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,871
Exclusively. No interviews elsewhere.

135
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,665
She's stressed and nervous.
Don't screw up.

136
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,750
OK.

137
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,252
Can you do something about
this whistling noise?

138
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:57,799
- Live in 5, 4, 3, 2...
- Live.

139
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:01,428
Good evening everyone, welcome,
and thanks for your loyalty.

140
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,641
Infinitif is live
like every Sunday...

141
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,311
You write, and you fail
to be published.

142
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,772
All the publishers
reject your manuscript.

143
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:14,483
Don't despair. This show's
just for you.

144
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,153
Imagine a library
that would collect all the texts

145
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,863
that publishers didn't want.

146
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:24,743
Well, such library exists
in Brittany,

147
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,870
in the little village of Crozon.

148
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:30,249
It's called the library
of rejected books.

149
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:35,003
It's right there that a young editor
at Grasset, Ms Daphne Despero,

150
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,423
who's with us tonight, thanks
for accepting our invitation,

151
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,302
discovered a manuscript which
she immediately wanted to publish,

152
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:47,766
The Last Hours of a Love Story
by the mysterious Henri Pick.

153
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:53,897
The book was published a few weeks ago
and is already a literary sensation.

154
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,149
You'll talk in more detail about it,

155
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:59,111
and Wendy will take us,
thanks to your report,

156
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:02,906
to discover this incredible,
unique library.

157
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,117
For those who haven't read it yet,

158
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,160
The Last Hours of a Love Story

159
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,663
depicts the end of a relationship

160
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,040
that parallels with the slow agony

161
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,043
of the great Russian poet
Alexander Pushkin

162
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:18,046
after he was wounded in a duel.

163
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:22,759
The author mixes love, death, in
an unsettling pas de deux.

164
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,431
It's a truly remarkable novel.
I'd say it's a little masterpiece.

165
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,934
- You've read it, I suppose?
- Yes, it's very powerful.

166
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,854
I think it resonates a bit
with your own work

167
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,523
which established you as
an ethnologist of eroticism.

168
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:40,360
We'd have loved to have
Henry Pick with us tonight,

169
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,529
but unfortunately,
he left us two years ago,

170
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,657
but I'm pleased to welcome
Madeleine Pick, his wife.

171
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,659
- Madeleine Pick, good evening.
- Good evening.

172
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:49,411
We are very happy
to have you here.

173
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,537
Thank you.

174
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,666
You agreed without hesitation
to publish this manuscript.

175
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,544
Do you think that was
what he'd have wanted?

176
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,254
I ask you this because

177
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:04,760
he seemed to be a bit of a recluse
who desired to stay in the shadows,

178
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:08,889
which reminds us of
the great Portuguese poet

179
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:13,810
Fernando Pessoa, who rarely used
his own name. What do you think?

180
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:18,273
How do I know if he wanted or not?
We can't ask him now.

181
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,734
Obviously not.

182
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,154
If you allow me, by agreeing
to publish her husband's novel,

183
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,531
Madeleine... brings him back to life.

184
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:28,867
- To a certain degree.
- Of course.

185
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,994
What kind of authors
did your husband read?

186
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:33,497
Classics or contemporaries?

187
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,374
I don't know.
I never saw him reading.

188
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,294
How come you never
saw him reading?

189
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:44,424
You mean you never
saw him reading or writing?

190
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,551
Don't you think it's odd?

191
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,432
If he wrote in secret,
maybe he read in secret too.

192
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:57,396
Well, where exactly
did he write in secret?

193
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,731
In the back room of your restaurant?

194
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,610
Yes. He spent there all the time.
His office was there too.

195
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:06,154
I have to specify to our viewers

196
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,032
that you and your husband
had a pizzeria in Crozon.

197
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,785
By the way, it seems people
from all over France come

198
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,496
just to see where your husband
wrote his novel.

199
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:17,666
They wouldn't be coming for pizza,
since it's a crepes place now.

200
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:18,875
Crepes, then.

201
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,421
Tell me how do you feel
about all this enthusiasm.

202
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,756
Well, I don't quite understand.

203
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:30,554
All the newspapers want to interview me,
they search through our life...

204
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:34,015
I even found a reporter in
my garden perched on my apple tree.

205
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,268
But you surely have
nothing to hide?

206
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,272
- No, why?
- No, it's... how to put it...

207
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:44,109
At times one can question
the authenticity...

208
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,112
of this novel's origins.
You know what I mean?

209
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:50,157
- What?
- What are you playing at, Jean-Michel?

210
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:54,286
I'm just asking out loud
what many people say quietly.

211
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,663
- What's that?
- Are you sure

212
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,748
that your husband
really wrote this novel?

213
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,876
How come? I don't understand!

214
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,378
- You don't?
- Cut it off, Jean-Michel!

215
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,672
Well I say this because...

216
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:10,177
One can't read this novel
without being seized by doubts.

217
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:13,180
Pardon me, what are you
insinuating?

218
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,641
What if this is just
an incredible editorial coup?

219
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:20,437
Yes, it's a remarkable novel.
But the story of the novel...

220
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,773
The story of the novel,
the entire set-up...

221
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:27,777
This idea of a literary gem
found in the heart of Brittany,

222
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,279
Pure genius.

223
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,156
You understand why
I ask this question?

224
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,283
So what is the truth,
Daphne Despero?

225
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,368
The truth is very simple:

226
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,163
When I heard about
the library of rejected books,

227
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:41,791
I intuitively felt the need
to give it a closer look.

228
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,378
And once I was inside,
it's strange,

229
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,424
I felt like a call. As if...

230
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,427
As if Henri Pick's ghost had
designated you, is that right?

231
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,013
Just like St Theresa of Avila.

232
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,182
Enough with this circus!

233
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,768
- You're mocking my husband!
- What she's done to us!

234
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,646
No! Switch to the documentary
on Crozon.

235
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,316
The little village of Crozon
became a place of pilgrimage...

236
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,237
You're not gonna leave the set
just like that?

237
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,364
Spare us of this psychodrama!

238
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,199
Get this thing off me!

239
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:16,368
Can you imagine a Breton pizza maker

240
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,121
who never wrote a line,
to produce a book of this caliber?

241
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,082
He was surely a nice guy, but...

242
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,334
How dares he to say that?

243
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,753
It's such a smug thing to say!

244
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:29,714
Many authors were doing something else
before they began writing for a living.

245
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,717
Bukowski was a postman, Kafka was
an insurance clerk, and Lamartine...

246
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,137
Lamartine was a bodyguard.
Bodyguard. Kevin Costner.

247
00:17:36,264 --> 00:17:38,139
- And who are you?
- I'm Josephine Pick.

248
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,268
The daughter of that Breton pizza maker
who never read a book in his life,

249
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,520
and who tells you to piss off
from beyond the grave!

250
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,188
I never said that!

251
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,817
That's enough!

252
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:50,819
Excuse us.

253
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,737
What's wrong?
What's the problem?

254
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,573
I'm just doing my job
as a literary critic.

255
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,993
No. You're a presenter. You present
and nothing else is required.

256
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,871
Come to your senses, apologize
and we'll finish the show! Come on!

257
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:05,500
- Bring them back, please.
- They're gone, Serge.

258
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,836
- What?
- They left.

259
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:10,714
I'll apologize, but I'm not
a presenter.

260
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,466
- No one talked to me like that!
- Live in 5, 4...

261
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,595
- I'll tell you one thing...
- 3, 2, 1 !

262
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,221
- You're live.
- Good evening.

263
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,140
We are back again...

264
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,690
- So you attack old ladies now?
- Not at all!

265
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,235
Don't you see this story
doesn't stand scrutiny?

266
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,946
You've read the book.
You see what I mean?

267
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,702
- You've become so cynical!
- Not really.

268
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,496
You believe in nothing. You don't see
the beauty of things anymore.

269
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,875
Remember? When we met,
you were so passionate...

270
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,085
Literature was everything to you.

271
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:50,503
It was your religion.

272
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,214
Since you began working on TV,
you've got smaller

273
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,133
even on a large screen...

274
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:01,890
This book overwhelmed me.
It was like an existential shock.

275
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,643
An existential shock? Really?

276
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,479
We're separating, Jean-Michel.

277
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:13,109
We're not gonna separate
over a book. It's ridiculous.

278
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,321
Don't get all worked up.
Let's part nicely.

279
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,823
A separation can also be poetic.

280
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,993
This is what Henri Pick
demonstrates in his novel.

281
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:23,703
Make an effort.

282
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,331
Are you serious?

283
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,876
Our relationship ended long time ago,
you know it.

284
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,713
- Can we take time to think it over?
- It's too late for that.

285
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,131
Too late?

286
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,760
Let it go.
Follow Pushkin's example

287
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,262
when he understands
that it's useless to fight,

288
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,265
and death will get him anyway.

289
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,354
He accepts it and goes serenely.
It's so powerful!

290
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,565
I'll help you to pack a bag

291
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:58,071
with a few things, for now,
so you too can go serenely.

292
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,758
WHO IS HENRI PICK?

293
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,689
Here's your Papa doble,
Mr. Rouche,

294
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,068
Thanks, Julien.

295
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,836
Bad news?

296
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,714
Tonight my wife kicked me out
like a rat,

297
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,092
and they just let me know via SMS

298
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,095
that I've been fired.

299
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,641
- I'll take another one.
- Coming up.

300
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,822
"And happiness was so possible..."

301
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,746
Cleaning!

302
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:39,589
Brigitte? It's me.
I thought about it last night.

303
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,508
And I disagree with you.

304
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:45,011
What you find poetic,
seems violent to me...

305
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,849
This woman's cruelty, as
she was leaving home...

306
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,393
Wait a moment,
I'm looking for that passage.

307
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,313
When she leaves the house,

308
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,482
and when she says...

309
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:05,615
Wait. I can't find
that passage. Call me back.

310
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,079
THE LAST HOURS OF A LOVE STORY.

311
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,259
There it is. On this computer
you will find the list

312
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,011
of all the texts received
by Gallimard since 1992.

313
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,891
- And before 1 992?
- It's here. Starting from 1 91 9.

314
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,479
Oh, yes. OK, thanks a lot.

315
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:40,233
Henri Pick.

316
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,610
No documents found.

317
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,869
The Last Hours of a Love Story.

318
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,329
No documents found.

319
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,498
You can't imagine how much buzz
you created for us, Jean-Michel.

320
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:40,126
The book was already selling
like crazy but now...

321
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,755
Since your show, the bookstores
are running out of copies.

322
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,632
You should pay me royalties.

323
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,635
- You want... Small? Large?
- I want the truth.

324
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,638
Who was that ghostwriter?

325
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,223
Because the guy is talented.
Very talented.

326
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,645
They do this for footballers
or reality-TV starlets.

327
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:02,106
Not for some obscure pizza maker.

328
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,442
Did you give it for an expertise?

329
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:05,944
But of course!

330
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:09,614
Should we also do a DNA test
or carbon dating...

331
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:10,698
while we're at it?

332
00:24:10,741 --> 00:24:14,869
You know what? Let's also
ask for Pick's exhumation.

333
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,995
Very funny.

334
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,121
Michel!

335
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:21,084
Did you know that he never sent
the manuscript to any publisher?

336
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,586
Never. I checked. None.

337
00:24:23,754 --> 00:24:27,715
It emerged in the library of
rejected books without being rejected.

338
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:30,134
- Don't you find that curious?
- So what?

339
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:33,721
It's not forbidden to keep your
novel to yourself. Take a seat.

340
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,769
They praised the qualities
of a man who never sought glory.

341
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:42,230
You know very well that
all writers dream

342
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,109
that one day their talent
would be recognized.

343
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,620
Honestly, if this whole story
were a hoax, I would know.

344
00:24:57,705 --> 00:25:00,123
- Do you really think that?
- Daphne Despero.

345
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:03,001
I can't see her being able
to dupe me like that.

346
00:25:03,127 --> 00:25:07,255
I assure you, when she
brought Pick's manuscript,

347
00:25:07,381 --> 00:25:11,134
she had that twinkle in her eye,
like as if she'd discovered Peru.

348
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,261
You know she sold
the movie rights?

349
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,222
Apparently, the movie would be
more about Henri Pick

350
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,016
than about his novel.

351
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,353
- They paid, they do what they like.
- Our era is really obsessed with form.

352
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,982
But you? Are you returning
to the written criticism?

353
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,735
And we'll shake in our boots again
every Thursday,

354
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,945
waiting for an issue of
Figaro litteraire?

355
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:35,616
- Did I really terrorize you?
- Not me. The others, yes.

356
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:37,952
Actually...

357
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:43,374
Here. Come to celebrate Pick's
success with us in a dignified way.

358
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,709
OK?

359
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:49,964
Ines, I'll prove that Henri Pick
can't be the author.

360
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,384
Now you're turning this
into a personal matter.

361
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,638
I have no idea who wrote this book,
why he used Pick's name,

362
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,392
how it turned up in
this unbelievable library,

363
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,229
but I'll find out.

364
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,440
Are you really gonna embark
on this crusade

365
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:10,985
just to prove you're right?

366
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,491
- I'm coming down now.
- Hello.

367
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,452
Mr. Rouche.
What can I do for you?

368
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:23,623
I just spoke with Ines de Crecy.
You didn't lie to her, I hope?

369
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,833
- Why would you say that?
- That'd be a dangerous game.

370
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,879
It could endanger your career.
You realize that?

371
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:34,092
You continue with your insinuations!
Sorry, I'm expected for lunch.

372
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,137
- Shall we go?
- Wait. Hello.

373
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:41,390
Frederic Koska. You were supposed
to review my book on your show,

374
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,143
my first book, The Bathtub,
but ran out of time. Remember?

375
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:45,686
Maybe.

376
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,106
May I ask what you thought about it?

377
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,192
- Yes, you may.
- Fred, I only have 30 minutes for lunch.

378
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:53,361
- Just a sec, please.
- I'll wait for you over there.

379
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:57,115
But why do you run from me?
What are you afraid of?

380
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,618
It's presumptuous of you to think
you're intimidating me.

381
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,246
You're obsessed with it.

382
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:06,582
The book has found its audience.
Everyone loves it. What bothers you?

383
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:09,460
Henri Pick never wrote
a line in his life.

384
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,754
I'll never let you
defile his memory.

385
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,632
Don't lose your temper. Some
may think you're being defensive.

386
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:18,136
You touched on Daphne's sensitive spot.

387
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,347
You know, Henri Pick became
the most important person in her life.

388
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,891
A kind of omnipresent God
she reveres.

389
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,976
Others don't matter.

390
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,478
What's got into to you?
Are you jealous or what?

391
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,980
How could I not be jealous?

392
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,191
OK, you have no time.
I'm not hungry anymore. Bye.

393
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:35,486
I hope you'll have the opportunity
to speak about my book next time.

394
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,990
Miss, let me tell you one thing.

395
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,326
Literary impostors
always end up being exposed.

396
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:45,496
No offense, but you're
a raving conspirologist.

397
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:48,207
Fred, wait!

398
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,882
It's indeed extremely well detailed.

399
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,967
The mores of the time are
well rendered.

400
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:43,221
The author is surely an expert
on Russia.

401
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,390
Maybe a historian
who must speak Russian.

402
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,768
What makes you believe that?

403
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,854
He relies on a rather
controversial book,

404
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:56,192
which gives a different take on
the circumstances of Pushkin's death.

405
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,987
And that book has never
been translated into French.

406
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:08,871
Brigitte, you never called me back.
Don't bother. I'm leaving.

407
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:15,461
I'm leaving Paris and I'm not sure
if I'll have coverage over there.

408
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:19,632
Could you please keep checking
on my mail at Bristol?

409
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,386
I'll come for my things later.

410
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,632
Anybody there?

411
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,386
Yes, I'm coming.

412
00:30:57,606 --> 00:31:01,067
This show is presented to you
by Audible.

413
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,695
See me again next Sunday
at another edition of Infinitif,

414
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:08,324
to talk about writing,
reading and literature.

415
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,507
- Who's there?
- Jean-Michel Rouche.

416
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,635
No. Leave me alone. Go away.

417
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:32,264
I've come to apologize, Madeleine.

418
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,769
I've travelled 600 km to see you.

419
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:40,064
Spare me just a moment. One moment!

420
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:44,068
Madeleine, you said that

421
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,569
this whole story, for you,

422
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,447
was an opportunity to bring
your husband back to life.

423
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,616
Well, bring him
back to life for me!

424
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,576
Bring him back to life for me!

425
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,747
Tell me why it's so obvious
to you that he wrote the book.

426
00:31:56,998 --> 00:32:02,628
Be nice, Madeleine.
Open the door. Madeleine, please!

427
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:06,966
Come in.

428
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,886
1 6 months spent on a warship
in the middle of the Indian Ocean!

429
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:13,139
Can you imagine?
And when we met again, we swore

430
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,765
to never part again.

431
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,642
And that's what we did
until his death.

432
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:21,355
I think Henri kept in him
this fear of losing me.

433
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,191
And he rendered it many years later
in his book.

434
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:30,698
- Did your husband speak Russian?
- No, why?

435
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:33,868
Because Russia figures
prominently in the book.

436
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,371
Well, he liked vodka a lot.

437
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:41,000
And he made a red chilli pizza,
and called it the Stalin-style.

438
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:44,128
A real Russophile, this Henri!

439
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:49,008
- Was he a bit depressive?
- Not at all. Why'd you say that?

440
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:54,263
- He looks very serious in that photo.
- Don't you see he's smiling?

441
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,391
You think he's smiling?

442
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,643
I know my husband.

443
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,481
It's harder to guess
because of the mustache.

444
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,233
Behind his mustache, he smiles.

445
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:09,820
- I believe you.
- You don't look like you do.

446
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:13,115
You seem to believe
nothing of what I told you.

447
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:17,328
It's normal to feel that way. You were
told your husband wrote a book,

448
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,498
so you search for traces
of your own life in every line.

449
00:33:20,624 --> 00:33:23,959
Don't you see the connection between
my memories and his book?

450
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,252
It can't be a coincidence.

451
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:28,255
We always find ourselves
in a book.

452
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:32,134
Just as I thought: I didn't convince
you. I'll see you out.

453
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,138
Did they give you back
the original manuscript?

454
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,264
Yes.

455
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,642
I'd really like to see it,
if possible.

456
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,730
Madeleine,
it's a misunderstanding.

457
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:50,986
Good morning, sisters.

458
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:07,002
Here. Thanks a lot!
Goodbye! See you soon, I hope.

459
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,800
- Are you finished with it?
- Yes, it was very good.

460
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,677
Would you like to
come with me for the visit?

461
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,678
Yes.

462
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,929
Come.

463
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,681
Your four-cheese pizza.

464
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:28,023
- Everything's good, sir?
- Very good. Delicious. Thanks.

465
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:32,278
I wanted to thank you personally
for ordering a crepe.

466
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,655
That's nice of you. But in a
creperie, normally...

467
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:38,033
Yes. But since Pick's book,
people who come here

468
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,911
think it's still a pizzeria,
and they order pizza.

469
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,913
So we had to put it back on the menu.

470
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,124
Oh, yeah? Sit down, please.

471
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,917
You aren't too happy about it.

472
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:50,296
I'm specialized in crepes,
not in pizza.

473
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:55,050
It ain't easy, you know? My wife
says I should see a shrink.

474
00:34:55,552 --> 00:34:57,303
This damned book!

475
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,763
Did you know Henri Pick?

476
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,558
No. I took over the restaurant
after his death.

477
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,645
- I'll get you a liqueur. It's on me.
- That's nice.

478
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,277
Madam, can I have the check, please.

479
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:21,160
Would it be possible
to visit you-know-what?

480
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,123
- Sure. Come with me.
- Gladly.

481
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:34,757
- Here's where he wrote it.
- Oh, yes...

482
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:39,803
- May I take a photo?
- Sure.

483
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:44,058
We left everything as it was.
Nothing was touched.

484
00:35:48,605 --> 00:35:50,522
- Is this his office?
- Yes.

485
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:53,025
- May I?
- Of course.

486
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:06,121
Remember, in the book, when
Pushkin agonizes on his deathbed,

487
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:10,167
from the window of his room he could
see the village bell tower.

488
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,418
Look.

489
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,171
- I can't see anything.
- Lean back.

490
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:17,299
- Lean some more!
- No, I don't see it.

491
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,429
- Farther back!
- Yes, you're right. Indeed.

492
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,184
- Have a glass of chouchenn.
- Thanks, very kind of you.

493
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,936
And thanks again for the crepe.

494
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,607
- You think I could charge for the visits?
- I don't know.

495
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:37,236
Well, the cemetery guard
isn't shy to ask for money.

496
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:38,987
Oh yeah?

497
00:36:47,664 --> 00:36:49,665
- Here.
- Thanks.

498
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,043
- It's over there.
- Many thanks. Have a good day.

499
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,177
- Remove those that are faded.
- OK.

500
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,935
What are you doing here?

501
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,860
My mother just told me on the phone
that you harassed her at her home!

502
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,155
Now you have the nerve to come here!
What's wrong with you?

503
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,992
- Who do you think you are?
- OK, I'm leaving. Sorry.

504
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,035
Have a good day. Excuse me.

505
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:58,025
- You want me to feel pity for you?
- Not at all. I'm a bit lost.

506
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,529
It fits.

507
00:38:03,031 --> 00:38:04,490
I'm exhausted.

508
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,371
Why did you come here?

509
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,250
Well... I'm not sure
you'd like it.

510
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,669
Try it. I'm tough as a tank.

511
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,005
Well?

512
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:24,885
Are you kidding me?

513
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,388
And where did you hope to
find evidence? On his grave?

514
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,307
One must start somewhere.

515
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,270
- Where do I take you?
- Hotel du Port.

516
00:38:35,355 --> 00:38:37,898
- Oh, no!
- It won't take long, dear.

517
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:44,029
- What do you think?
- About what?

518
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,907
My father's book?
It's none of your business.

519
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:53,247
What makes me doubt it is that
he never wrote anything else.

520
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:58,544
If we could find a greeting card,
a letter, a postcard...

521
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,171
I've got his letters.
What do you imagine?

522
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,173
- Oh really?
- Yes.

523
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,552
Yes, he wrote me
a very beautiful letter

524
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:08,804
when I went on a school
skiing trip.

525
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,764
That proves his talent.

526
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,766
If you read it, you would be
forced to recant.

527
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm willing to take the risk.

528
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,396
Yes, but I have no idea
where I put it.

529
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:21,149
Yes, I put it in a book.
But which one?

530
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:24,278
- I can help you look for it.
- Now really!

531
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,656
I don't trust you, Mr. Rouche.

532
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,491
You're right.

533
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,288
It was on the left!

534
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,165
The faster you read the letter,
the sooner you'll leave.

535
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,543
And then, I'd rather
have you in my view.

536
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:46,300
- Can I come in?
- Stop playing on your phone!

537
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,302
- Should I close the door?
- Yes, please.

538
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,805
Go settle in the living room.

539
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,183
- Honey, take your snack.
- OK.

540
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,023
Well, I thought it'd be easier.

541
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,609
What did you think, that
country people don't read?

542
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,528
Not at all, on the contrary.
That's all you can do here.

543
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,280
Just kidding.

544
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,617
I'm really very impressed.

545
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:16,163
However, I can't figure out
the logic of your classification system.

546
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,291
I sort them by theme using
the good neighbor rule.

547
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:21,793
Often, when searching for a book,

548
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,171
the one you really need
is the one next to it.

549
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,423
- The Warburg method?
- Exactly.

550
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:30,010
Which lets you put Henry Miller
and Anais Nin side by side

551
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,803
without Nietzsche
being in the middle.

552
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,764
Sit down, don't touch anything.

553
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,434
Melville, please, go get your
things. Your father'll be here soon.

554
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:38,894
Alright.

555
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,151
Are you separated from his dad?

556
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,613
- You are very nosy.
- Sorry.

557
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,783
Yes, he dumped me last year.

558
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:53,909
That's it.

559
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,994
He attempted a comeback when he saw

560
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,913
that we were going
to collect the royalties.

561
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:01,291
When he realized that everything
was going to a charity,

562
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,627
he dumped me again.
He's that kind of guy.

563
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:06,755
I don't get it. You don't
want the royalties?

564
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,675
- No.
- You know, it's a lot of money.

565
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,680
May I ask you to which charity
you'll donate the money?

566
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:18,642
To the foundation for
Alzheimer's research.

567
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:22,646
Where did I put that letter,
dammit!

568
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,273
You really don't want my help?

569
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,736
OK. Go ahead,
but don't mess up anything.

570
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,536
Funny. You have a Pushkin.

571
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,497
The Captain's Daughter.

572
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,666
Turgenev's novellas,

573
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,793
- Anna Karenina...
- Yes. So what?

574
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:47,754
Maybe it's you,
the fiendish mystificator.

575
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,173
- Are you serious?
- Well, yes.

576
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:54,886
When your husband left you,
writing was your catharsis.

577
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,931
But since you didn't want
to give him the vain pleasure

578
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,766
of being the hero of a novel,

579
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:02,185
you didn't seek to publish it.

580
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,021
And I signed it with my dad's name

581
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:07,149
and I left it at the library?
Clever!

582
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:11,528
You do have imagination. Obviously.
You just forget one detail.

583
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:15,741
- I wouldn't be able to write a novel.
- What's your ex-husband's name?

584
00:42:16,409 --> 00:42:20,537
- Marc.
- But the book is dedicated to M.

585
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:25,417
He'd be the last person I'd dedicate
a book to.

586
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:30,005
- M for Melville.
- Well then maybe he wrote it.

587
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,258
And dedicated it to his mother.
That's very cute!

588
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,677
I'm not ruling out anything.

589
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:40,015
- That's it, you wrote it.
- Me?

590
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:44,686
Why would I then come to Crozon,
to the end of the world,

591
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:48,899
to find out what I already knew? It's
from the realm of psychiatry.

592
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,777
Here's a great classic of noir fiction.

593
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,404
The schizophrenic detective
who investigates himself.

594
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:58,867
You really write very well.
I was reading you in Le Figaro.

595
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,537
I was listening to you at The Mask and
the Pen. You really made me laugh.

596
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,916
Grandma Donald!

597
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,418
What is "Grandma Donald"?

598
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,921
That was my fist cooking book,
my father gave it to me.

599
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:13,298
Grandma Donald's Good Recipes.

600
00:43:14,634 --> 00:43:15,675
I've got it.

601
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,658
May I?

602
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,286
Sure. Help yourself.

603
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:47,499
"Sweetie, your letter
pleased me a great deal.

604
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,918
"And besides you tell me
lots of things.

605
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:54,548
"I'm glad you're in the same
room with your friend Hortense.

606
00:43:54,674 --> 00:43:58,051
"I hope you're no longer
afraid of the chairlifts,"

607
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:00,387
"and you'll return
with the first prize."

608
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:05,058
"If not, who cares. We miss
you a lot. Enjoy your stay."

609
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:07,310
"You're coming back Sunday."

610
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,896
"It's been raining since you left.
It's sad. Daddy."

611
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,275
"P.S. Thanks for your sketch of
the mountain. It's very beautiful."

612
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,489
Well, it's not exactly
what I remembered.

613
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,409
Childhood memories aren't
very reliable, unfortunately.

614
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:24,786
After all, you could
say it has a touch of...

615
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:32,169
- A touch of Duras.
- Yes, in the economy of style.

616
00:44:32,879 --> 00:44:34,421
Duras... The economy...

617
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:38,925
Duras would have written:
"The father writes.

618
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,386
"The father has decided
to write to his daughter.

619
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:43,180
"Writing is not talking."

620
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,140
"Writing is silent."

621
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,434
"Writing is shouting silently."

622
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,269
"So the father writes to his daughter."

623
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,897
"He really hoped she would get
the first prize."

624
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,526
"He never received awards. That is
why he hoped his daughter gets one."

625
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,738
This usually makes people laugh. But
now it's probably not the right time.

626
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:04,659
A letter to a child and a novel
have nothing in common.

627
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:08,872
If we found Proust's shopping list,

628
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,917
we wouldn't recognize in it
the author of...

629
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,294
Remembrance of Things Past.

630
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:18,048
Yes, but they found Proust's shopping
list, and it looks great.

631
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,799
Listen, I'm gonna be blunt

632
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,052
but given the style, the syntax,

633
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,763
it's totally impossible
that your father wrote that book.

634
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,765
I'm sorry.

635
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:32,187
Alright, I'll leave you now.

636
00:45:35,024 --> 00:45:36,900
So if it wasn't him, then who?

637
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:38,735
I don't know.

638
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,780
But when I find out,
I hope you'll forgive me.

639
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,531
Good night.

640
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:15,981
LIBRARY.

641
00:46:23,531 --> 00:46:27,492
SLAVIC LITERATURE.

642
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:31,913
Good morning, madam.

643
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:35,375
Mr. Rouche, good morning, but...

644
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:40,171
It's an honor to have you here.
What can I do for you?

645
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:44,926
I'd like to see the library of rejected
books if that's possible.

646
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,636
Yes, of course.

647
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,805
Excuse me.

648
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:50,557
Follow me.

649
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:54,769
You were here when Daphne Despero
found the manuscript?

650
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:56,521
The Last Hours of a Love Story?

651
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,774
Yes, she came one afternoon, and...

652
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:02,986
before she left, she asked me
if she could borrow a manuscript.

653
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:06,781
- It was Henri Pick's.
- Are you sure it was that one?

654
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:10,744
Yes, she showed it to me. I thought
it was a beautiful title.

655
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:13,747
- And then, when the book came out,
- Yes?

656
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,623
I read it right away
and loved it.

657
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:19,794
- Did you like it?
- Yes, very much.

658
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,130
- Here it is.
- Good morning.

659
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:23,757
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

660
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,177
Yes, it's the publishers'
latest fad.

661
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:30,930
They send interns over here
hoping to find another gem.

662
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:34,059
- Anything interesting?
- Not really.

663
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,310
May I take a look?

664
00:47:36,062 --> 00:47:39,522
Inflatable Dolls Don't Have
Menopause Problems.

665
00:47:42,151 --> 00:47:43,360
What about you?

666
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,156
- Mr. Rouche, pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

667
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,909
- It's a bunch of nonsense.
- May I?

668
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,912
How to Cook on
the Engine of Your Car.

669
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,038
Oh, yeah.

670
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,793
I never understood the point of
depositing texts nobody wants.

671
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:03,171
But when Mr. Gourvec fell ill,

672
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,007
he made me promise him
to look after this place.

673
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,677
He said, "All these writers trusted us."

674
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,179
"We can't betray them."

675
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,432
So, since he died,
I've kept everything as it was.

676
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,060
- Gourvec?
- Yes.

677
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,771
He founded this library.

678
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:24,526
It's him. Look.
He was an exceptional man.

679
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:27,278
He was so passionate
about his work...

680
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:31,282
Yes, one must be passionate
to create a place like this.

681
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:34,494
At the beginning, the media
covered it a lot.

682
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:36,996
They even came here to make
a TV special.

683
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,289
- Really?
- Yes.

684
00:48:40,376 --> 00:48:42,377
- Are these the internal rules?
- Yes.

685
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,754
- May I?
- Of course.

686
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:49,926
"First, the manuscript must
have never been published."

687
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,678
- Never.
- Secondly,

688
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,680
"storing the manuscript
is free."

689
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:56,891
Eightly, ninthly...
Oh! What does that mean?

690
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,895
"Poan ar re all so skanv da zougen."

691
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,357
- It's in Breton.
- And it means what?

692
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,028
It means: "The pain of others
is easy to bear."

693
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,281
May I? Carefully.

694
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:13,533
"The pain of others is easy
to bear"...

695
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,038
- Do you have a registry of entries?
- Yes, of course.

696
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,791
Oh! The Last Hours
of a Love Story...

697
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,544
Pick was one of the first
submissions?

698
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,670
Yes!

699
00:49:28,174 --> 00:49:30,300
Was it you who registered it,
perchance?

700
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,678
No. I came here afterwards.

701
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:36,306
Yes. May I?

702
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:41,186
- Are you of Russian origin?
- Not at all.

703
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:44,022
- And Jean-Pierre Gourvec?
- 100% Breton.

704
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:48,151
I ask because you have a fair amount
of Russian novels here.

705
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:52,363
It's funny you have everything by
Pushkin, except Eugene Onegin.

706
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,908
You must have it because
it's his best known work.

707
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:04,000
Eugene Onegin was borrowed
5 years ago, but it was returned.

708
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,628
It should've been here,
I don't understand.

709
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,298
Can you give me the borrower's name?

710
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:13,176
Benedicte le Floch?
Jean-Michel Rouche.

711
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,054
- Come in, please.
- You're adorable. Thanks a lot.

712
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:20,141
Ladies, we have a prominent
surprise guest.

713
00:50:20,893 --> 00:50:25,605
Let me introduce you to the members
of the Crozon Book Club.

714
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,106
Delighted.

715
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,984
We're all your loyal fans.

716
00:50:30,236 --> 00:50:32,278
Infinitif isn't the same
without you.

717
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,989
We should petition for
your return.

718
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:36,533
Yes.

719
00:50:36,534 --> 00:50:38,785
But what brings you to Crozon?

720
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,540
I wanted to visit this famous
library of rejected books.

721
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,168
It's a bit complicated
what I'm gonna ask you.

722
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:52,423
5 years ago you borrowed
a book from the library.

723
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:56,010
Eugene Onegin, by Alexander Pushkin.

724
00:50:56,178 --> 00:50:58,638
- Did you return it?
- Oh, yes!

725
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,266
I always return the books I borrow.

726
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:04,686
And then the book
didn't really hook me.

727
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,604
You didn't like it?

728
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,523
No. I thought it was a thriller.

729
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,859
Because there was a guy
with a gun on the cover.

730
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,863
It turned out to be poetry.
It's not my thing.

731
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:17,782
I have to tell you, Mr. Rouche.

732
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:21,244
Here, in our club,
we only read thrillers.

733
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,622
Today, we discuss
the latest Bjorn Olafsson.

734
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:27,667
A Smell of Blood and
Cut-off Bones, did you read it?

735
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:31,170
- No.
- Let's ask him.

736
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:37,302
You think one can dismember
a corpse with an electric knife?

737
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,055
- A corpse?
- Yes.

738
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:44,017
Let's say the body of
a man of your built.

739
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,651
No idea. Maybe I'll leave you now.

740
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,654
No way. It'd take a saw.

741
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,156
Or a chainsaw.

742
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,534
Benedicte, have you got
an electric knife in your kitchen?

743
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:05,371
No. But maybe I should
order one for Christmas.

744
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,750
But tell us, Mr. Rouche,

745
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:11,919
what were you looking for
in that library?

746
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:14,005
Has it anything to do
with Henri Pick?

747
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:15,632
You're still skeptical, right?

748
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:19,761
You know, here in Brittany,
we see even stranger things.

749
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,306
What really interests me

750
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:28,061
is the former librarian,
Mr. Jean-Pierre Gourvec.

751
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:31,522
- Did you know him?
- Of course.

752
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:35,151
And I knew his wife well too.

753
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:36,486
Was he married?

754
00:52:36,779 --> 00:52:39,614
- I thought he preferred men.
- Me too.

755
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:43,284
It was more than 50 years ago.
She used to give me piano lessons.

756
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:47,288
In fact, she lived here
one year, two years at most.

757
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,916
And then she moved to Paris.

758
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,294
And Gourvec never heard of her since.

759
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,923
Besides, I think that made him
very unhappy.

760
00:52:57,758 --> 00:53:02,387
- How was this Mrs Gourvec called?
- Ludmila.

761
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,517
Ludmila? She was Russian?

762
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,936
Yes, she came from the USSR.

763
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,509
Good morning, Josephine.
I came to say goodbye.

764
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:45,513
Leaving?

765
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:48,933
Yes, I have to go back to Paris
to check on a couple of things.

766
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,311
And there's a reception tomorrow
night at Grasset. I'd better be there.

767
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,647
Isn't it hypocritical to
celebrate the success of a book

768
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:57,150
that you suspect of being
a literary hoax?

769
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,987
Do you have a goat?

770
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:03,030
No, it's Juan, the
neighbor's billy goat.

771
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,035
Aren't you going too?
They invited you, though.

772
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,913
I got an invitation, but I'm
not going, I don't know anyone.

773
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:14,417
- But you know me.
- Why? You need a ride?

774
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,795
No. I'll take a bus and a train.

775
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,548
- Have a good trip.
- Have a good day.

776
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:36,230
Get in. I'm going with you.
I want a change of scene.

777
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,655
You prefer to keep an eye on me?

778
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,161
I really wish I knew one thing.

779
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,246
Why is it so important to you

780
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,290
to prove that my father
didn't write the book?

781
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,501
What are you a knight of probity?

782
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,170
A guardian of French literature?

783
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,048
I lost almost everything
because of this book.

784
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,675
I lost my job, my
reputation and my wife.

785
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,303
And yet, irrationally,

786
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,806
this whole affair was
my awakening.

787
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,809
I have to go all the way
with this inquiry.

788
00:55:12,935 --> 00:55:14,143
I see.

789
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:18,231
But you're about to upturn
our lives in the process.

790
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,650
It's this book that
upturns our lives.

791
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,652
Don't you think, Josephine?

792
00:55:25,906 --> 00:55:27,907
I love to see you driving.

793
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,051
It's like my past has taken on
another dimension.

794
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:51,430
Like a landscape you look at
from an opposite point of view.

795
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:56,143
This secret is almost
like a double life.

796
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,896
Do you realize how much
rewinding I had to do?

797
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,773
Pretty destabilizing, indeed.

798
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:03,484
I was worried about my mother.
I thought it'd finish her.

799
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,778
But not at all.
She takes it very well.

800
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:08,364
I even think it helps her
in her bereavement.

801
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,032
- So I follow her example.
- Yes.

802
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:12,243
The difference is that
you aren't a dupe.

803
00:56:12,286 --> 00:56:14,620
As long as the opposite
hasn't been proven.

804
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:18,040
The letter hasn't convinced you yet?

805
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,168
OK, forget the letter.

806
00:56:21,545 --> 00:56:23,921
At least, admit that there
are many inconsistencies.

807
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:27,300
If your father was so secretive,

808
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:31,679
why would he deposit
the manuscript at this library?

809
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,182
Why would he use his own name?

810
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,310
Any time, someone could discover it.

811
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,228
It's like a message in a bottle.

812
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:40,897
Writing a book, leaving it somewhere,

813
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:44,025
and hoping that someone, some day,
will discover it.

814
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:47,486
- It's completely illogical.
- True. But it's human.

815
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:50,156
One may want to protect
one's secret garden

816
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,158
and at the same time,
to dream of posterity.

817
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:54,285
He might've thought that
no one would ever

818
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:55,786
look into this library.

819
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:58,623
Right, who cares about manuscripts
that everybody rejected?

820
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,500
It's the best hiding place.
Lost amongst the others.

821
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:05,630
But the librarian Gourvec knew!

822
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:08,758
They knew each other, and he
was sworn to silence.

823
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:12,678
I can picture that scene:
"Jean-Pierre, my friend, I count on you."

824
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:15,014
"No gaffes when you come to eat"

825
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,683
"a four-cheese pizza
at the restaurant."

826
00:57:17,809 --> 00:57:19,185
It's too weak a phrase

827
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,771
for a hidden talent
of French litterature.

828
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,272
Ah! You see?

829
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,483
What are you doing tomorrow?

830
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:29,904
I have to go to the National Library
to check the audio-visual archives.

831
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,657
Why do you ask? Wanna join me?

832
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,867
Not at all. What
makes you think that?

833
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,286
I think you're crazy about me.

834
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,746
- Good night.
- Just an impression.

835
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:42,166
I'm going there too.
Don't get wrong ideas.

836
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:45,670
THE LIBRARY OF REJECTED BOOKS.

837
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,809
When I started here, the
library was in a deplorable state.

838
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,435
Half abandoned.

839
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,146
I put a lot of energy into
bringing this place to life.

840
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,359
So the mayor's office honored me
with an extra room.

841
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,278
Then I decided to give a chance

842
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:14,532
to all the manuscripts
rejected by the publishers.

843
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,243
Follow me.

844
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,123
Careful... After all,
they're books too.

845
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:27,294
Books orphaned of publishers.
Books dreaming of a shelter.

846
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:31,048
Well, here it is:
The library of rejected books.

847
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:33,801
The idea came to me from a
novel by Richard Brautigan,

848
00:58:33,927 --> 00:58:35,302
one of my favorite authors.

849
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:38,556
Anyone can deposit their text,
be it...

850
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:40,766
an essay:

851
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:45,521
How to Grow Flowers by Candlelight
in a Hotel Room.

852
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:50,234
A book of recipes of all the dishes
mentioned in Dostoevsky's novels.

853
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:52,862
Sort of... Cuisine and Punishment.

854
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,873
The rejection itself can't be indicative
of the book's quality.

855
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,416
Journey to the End of the Night,

856
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,668
Joyce's Ulysses, Swann's Way,

857
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,129
all of them were initially rejected.

858
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:14,508
For deposit requests,
Minitel is practical. 361 5 Refusal

859
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,261
I don't know why
it isn't working now.

860
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:20,264
Some writers have travelled
across the country

861
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,308
to unload here the fruits
of their failure.

862
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:25,311
We could look at it
as a mystical path.

863
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:29,273
The literary version
of the Way of St. James.

864
00:59:30,025 --> 00:59:33,527
Since our first year we've received
almost a thousand manuscripts.

865
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:35,654
Not bad, huh?

866
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:44,663
Look, Gourvec also uses a typewriter.

867
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,918
Yes. It's a Hermes 3000.
Just like my father's.

868
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,170
Maybe this confirms what I thought.

869
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:52,922
- Meaning?
- Follow me.

870
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:55,174
- Meaning?
- Follow me!

871
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,801
Should I get your stuff?

872
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,554
- Where are we going now?
- I need to check something again.

873
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:03,933
So, you won't tell me where
we're going. Nice. Good atmosphere.

874
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,936
We're close. We're close.

875
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,980
Author: Jean-Pierre Gourvec.

876
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:13,234
No documents found.

877
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,363
- Are you gonna explain it to me now?
- There's nothing.

878
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:18,781
What are we looking for?

879
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,501
That's it, I got it!

880
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,672
Look. Jean-Pierre Gourvec.

881
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,050
The Girl from Siberia.

882
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,053
So Gourvec did write a novel.

883
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:44,890
Which was rejected by Gallimard,

884
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,184
and probably by all other publishers,

885
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:50,396
and it ended up on the shelves

886
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,022
of the library of rejected books.

887
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,024
I don't see the connection
with my father's book.

888
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,528
It was Gourvec who wrote it!
You still don't get it?

889
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,906
He simply changed the title
and the author's name!

890
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:03,409
He rechristened The Girl from Siberia

891
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:06,245
as The Last Hours of a Love Story.
And signed it "Henri Pick".

892
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:09,623
OK, that's your hypothesis,
but why would he do that?

893
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,168
Good question.
Why would he do that?

894
01:01:12,252 --> 01:01:13,794
So why would he do that?

895
01:01:13,879 --> 01:01:16,380
Because he didn't want
someone to believe

896
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:20,926
that all the energy he put
into creating this library

897
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,512
actually had a strong
personal motive.

898
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:27,683
And yet, he created that place
as a tomb for his novel.

899
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:31,478
- Gourvec, unbelievable!
- Why did he choose my father's name?

900
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,772
Well, you told me,
they were friends,

901
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:38,027
Choosing your father to become
the guardian of his most precious property

902
01:01:38,153 --> 01:01:42,615
meant choosing a shadow force,
totally unsuspectable.

903
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,034
Gourvec again!
You don't think so?

904
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,661
No, but I'm curious.

905
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:50,915
How are you gonna prove
this crazy theory?

906
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:54,418
Ludmila Blavitsky. His ex-wife.

907
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:57,796
She'll confirm it.
She's The Girl from Siberia.

908
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,925
- If she's still alive.
- She lives on Rue de Monpensier,

909
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,803
in front of the Palais Royal Theatre,
and we're invited for tea.

910
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:08,933
I take no credit. She was in
the phone book. Let's go.

911
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,686
So you are friends of Jean-Pierre's?

912
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,856
How is he?

913
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,279
Well, so so.
Well, he's... Tell her.

914
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,117
I'm sorry to tell you,
but he's dead.

915
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,162
For several years already.

916
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:35,668
For me, he'll always be the
handsome 20-year old man.

917
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:42,174
Impossible for me to imagine
that he may grow old... die...

918
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,551
Did you know he wrote a novel?

919
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:50,182
No, but he was an avid reader.

920
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:52,893
And I like listening to the music.

921
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,855
So, here it is...
an incompatible couple.

922
01:02:57,274 --> 01:03:00,985
Yes, it couldn't work.
Is that why you broke up?

923
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:05,030
We weren't really a couple.
It was a sham marriage.

924
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,659
I needed papers, and
he was willing to marry me.

925
01:03:09,035 --> 01:03:11,370
But why I'm telling you all this?

926
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:19,378
Gourvec wrote a novel titled
The Girl from Siberia.

927
01:03:19,421 --> 01:03:21,046
Do you originate from there?

928
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,257
My parents came from Warsaw,

929
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:26,385
but they were forced
to leave Poland in '39,

930
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:29,138
and went to Siberia.
Yes, I was born there.

931
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,267
This novel was inspired by you.

932
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:38,272
Your leaving. All the words he
didn't know how to tell you,

933
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,399
because he loved you.

934
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:45,154
- Jean-Pierre loved me?
- He did.

935
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,615
The manuscript was just discovered
and published under another title:

936
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,909
The Last Hours of a Love Story.

937
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:55,914
I'd really love to read it,
but I'm losing my eyesight.

938
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,376
- We could read it to you.
- Would you do that for me?

939
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:00,753
Of course.

940
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,881
This way you'll tell us
if you recognize yourself.

941
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:06,050
The book is dedicated to M.

942
01:04:06,426 --> 01:04:08,927
You have any idea who
that may be?

943
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:13,140
M for Milochka,
diminutive of Ludmila.

944
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:14,391
That's it!

945
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,312
Chapter One.

946
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:24,151
"Life doesn't want to escape me,"

947
01:04:24,277 --> 01:04:27,529
"preferring to stay in my body,
and let me suffer."

948
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:30,532
- Are you convinced now?
- Not at all.

949
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:33,494
Come on, haven't you
seen her emotions?

950
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,372
She kept saying
"It was so much like him!"

951
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,040
By the end, she had tears
in her eyes!

952
01:04:38,166 --> 01:04:40,042
My mother had exactly
the same reaction.

953
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:42,294
We always believe a good book
was written for us.

954
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,880
- Of course.
- Ludmila isn't even Russian,

955
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:46,799
- she's Polish.
- She was born in Omsk,

956
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,258
in the depths of Siberia.

957
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,053
Meanwhile, nothing says that
The Last Hours of a Love Story

958
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,263
and The Girl from Siberia
are the same novel.

959
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,517
You have no proof. Don't forget
the typewriter found at my father's.

960
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,268
Will you stop contradicting me?

961
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,646
I've no reason to deprive
myself of such pleasure.

962
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,525
- Where are you going?
- Over there. That's all.

963
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,652
My car is parked there.

964
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,991
- Good evening.
- Thanks.

965
01:05:13,118 --> 01:05:15,285
- Be discreet.
- Why?

966
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:19,373
- All those crackpot theories...
- Why do you say that?

967
01:05:19,666 --> 01:05:21,792
We're not discussing
them now, not here.

968
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:22,918
Let's go.

969
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,796
I'm counting on you.

970
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,006
Good evening.

971
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,008
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

972
01:05:32,554 --> 01:05:35,806
Good evening, Josephine. It's great
you could come. How are you?

973
01:05:35,890 --> 01:05:37,266
Very well, thanks.

974
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,184
- Mr. Rouche...
- Good evening.

975
01:05:39,561 --> 01:05:41,562
I'm surprised you were invited.

976
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:45,732
I knew Ines de Crecy even
before you were born.

977
01:05:46,359 --> 01:05:48,652
It's funny, because she never
spoke of you.

978
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:52,239
I've been wondering if you weren't
at the origins of this whole story,

979
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:56,243
but it's possible you were duped
like everyone else.

980
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:59,913
He's at it again. Don't mind him,
he's a bit obsessive.

981
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:02,291
I want you to meet someone.
Please come with me.

982
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:04,793
- With pleasure. See you.
- See you.

983
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:17,431
- Jean-Michel...
- Ines, how are you?

984
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,766
- Tell me, you came as a friend?
- Of course.

985
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:21,894
- Care for a drink?
- Gladly.

986
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,187
Two champagnes.

987
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:27,149
- Well?
- You saw they emulated us at Albin Michel?

988
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,653
They fished out some poor guy
who'd been rejected 32 times

989
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:38,035
just so they could put it on the cover:
"A novel rejected 32 times".

990
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:44,791
And Jack Lang wants to establish
the Day of Unpublished Authors.

991
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,170
Since one out of three Frenchmen
dabbles in writing,

992
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,547
there'll be a lot of people
out there in the streets.

993
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:53,926
That's the happiness and
the unhappiness of my profession.

994
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:57,429
There are more writers
than readers in France.

995
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,683
OK, I'll leave you.
See you later.

996
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:03,810
Sure. See you later.

997
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:10,275
Wendy, you're terrific!

998
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,157
Good luck.

999
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,670
I really don't have time.

1000
01:08:11,796 --> 01:08:13,297
- Why did you lie to me?
- What?

1001
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,882
I asked Ines what she thought
of my new novel.

1002
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:19,886
I told you to wait before talking
to her. You're so annoying.

1003
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,848
- Why did you say she'd read it?
- You put so much pressure on me!

1004
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,766
I only want you to keep
your promises.

1005
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,603
I'll mention it at the next
reading committee.

1006
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,856
I have to go back.
They're waiting for me.

1007
01:08:34,444 --> 01:08:35,986
We'll talk later, OK?

1008
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:02,512
Thank you, does everyone hear me?
Great.

1009
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,766
Thank you all for coming tonight

1010
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:10,562
to celebrate with us the great success
of Henri Pick's book,

1011
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,981
The Last Hours of a Love Story.

1012
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:17,569
Next to me is Daphne Despero,
Junior Editor.

1013
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:21,865
She is at the origins
of this incredible discovery.

1014
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,617
Welcome, Daphne!

1015
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,124
Excuse me, I'm a bit nervous.

1016
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:34,461
Thanks to you, Ines.

1017
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,589
And thanks to everyone
for being here today,

1018
01:09:37,632 --> 01:09:39,508
because it's you too
who made it happen.

1019
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:42,761
- She's beautiful!
- Good evening, how are you?

1020
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,723
Funny, when I first met her,
she looked rather short.

1021
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,142
Tonight she seems much taller.

1022
01:09:49,227 --> 01:09:51,520
Maybe it's because of the heels?

1023
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:54,106
No, because of the ambition.

1024
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:56,733
Of Henri, which I
would've liked to know.

1025
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,611
But I said to myself
that he's a bit with us

1026
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:02,114
tonight thanks to Josephine,
his daughter.

1027
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,241
Have a pleasant evening.

1028
01:10:06,077 --> 01:10:07,369
This is horrible.

1029
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:10,831
You still don't believe it?
It's stronger than you.

1030
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,999
Trust me, I also find it
hard to believe.

1031
01:10:13,084 --> 01:10:16,503
And rightly so, for all this is
just an enormous masquerade.

1032
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:20,632
It's obvious that Henri Pick
did not write this book.

1033
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:23,635
- Who wrote it then?
- Too soon to reveal.

1034
01:10:28,641 --> 01:10:29,975
By the way,

1035
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,602
you never told me
what you think about my novel.

1036
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:37,482
- The Shower, is it?
- The Bathtub.

1037
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:38,734
Oh, yes, The Bathtub.

1038
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,445
The Bathtub... Yes, yes.

1039
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:43,864
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and will tell you afterwards.

1040
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,198
I'm coming with you.

1041
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:53,623
I see you won't let me go
easily.

1042
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,084
Your opinion means a lot to me.

1043
01:10:56,878 --> 01:10:59,588
You can't imagine what you
represent for a young author.

1044
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,885
- Here.
- Are you crazy?

1045
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:08,346
- I haven't smoked since college.
- Trust me, it'll relax you.

1046
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:09,848
Why? Do I seem tense?

1047
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:13,268
No, but if you're gonna tell me at last
what you think about my book,

1048
01:11:13,478 --> 01:11:15,854
I'd rather have you in high spirits.

1049
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,857
In high spirits...

1050
01:11:19,358 --> 01:11:24,488
It takes time to understand
how the text breathes...

1051
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:26,865
Often, in debut novels,
you get the impression

1052
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:28,492
that the author tries to be
too perfect,

1053
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:30,994
- as if every phrase...
- You haven't actually read it?

1054
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:33,705
Well, no. I haven't.

1055
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:38,376
I get hundreds of debut novels.
I can't read them all.

1056
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:44,257
But the note card I was given
was very complimentary.

1057
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,512
Who knows? Maybe you'll be curious
to read it some day.

1058
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:53,475
But where did I put it?
Maybe it's in my office.

1059
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,853
Well, in my old office.
I mean, at my wife's.

1060
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,481
I mean, my ex wife.
It's complicated.

1061
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:00,607
I can imagine.

1062
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,235
I can send it to you again.

1063
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,570
Can you pass me the joint?

1064
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,743
- Are you writing anything now?
- Yes.

1065
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:14,120
I've just finished a new book.

1066
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,250
But tonight I found out that
its publication was delayed.

1067
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,502
It's not a good sign.

1068
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:22,963
What about you?

1069
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,590
Have you ever thought about writing

1070
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:28,385
something besides literary essays?

1071
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,389
- I mean fiction.
- I wrote fiction in my youth.

1072
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,975
I'm done with that.

1073
01:12:36,519 --> 01:12:39,729
Did you read my essays?

1074
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:43,567
I read Prolegomenon
or the Metaphysics of Narratology.

1075
01:12:45,111 --> 01:12:46,862
What was that about?

1076
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:50,866
I confess I had to do a research

1077
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:52,492
just to understand the title.

1078
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,331
Let's go back in.

1079
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:03,378
Now I'm inviting his daughter,
Josephine Pick, to join us.

1080
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:04,629
Come, Josephine.

1081
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,636
Good evening.

1082
01:13:12,471 --> 01:13:15,140
Thanks for my father.

1083
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,476
Thanks for giving me
the opportunity to talk about him.

1084
01:13:18,853 --> 01:13:23,106
I often try to imagine him
writing this novel.

1085
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,735
He always left early in the morning,
long before I woke up.

1086
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:31,239
Today I understand why he liked
so much to be alone in the restaurant.

1087
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:33,950
Probably he took advantage
of the silence at dawn.

1088
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:36,620
That's when the best ideas came to him,

1089
01:13:36,621 --> 01:13:39,497
while kneading the pizza dough.

1090
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,752
While the dough was rising,
he was writing.

1091
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:48,089
His flour-covered fingers
gave each sentence... something...

1092
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:52,010
You, in the back, what is it?
You have something to say?

1093
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:56,348
No, please go on! Excuse us.

1094
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,516
You have a whole audience
of journalists.

1095
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,393
A perfect opportunity to reveal
what you know.

1096
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,979
Will you stop it? No, I have
nothing to say, go on!

1097
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:05,857
If you have something to say,
go ahead, here's a mic.

1098
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:08,318
What Mr. Rouche hesitates to say

1099
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:11,571
is that he thinks everything here
is just a masquerade.

1100
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:14,866
And that Henri Pick is an impostor.

1101
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,872
Then, Mr. Rouche, tell us
who is the real author

1102
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:23,375
of The Last Hours of a
Love Story, we want to know!

1103
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:26,002
I have nothing to declare tonight!

1104
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,755
Little jerk! Go away!
Completely stoned!

1105
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:32,133
So no statement tonight
from Mr. Rouche,

1106
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,344
and we're all very happy.

1107
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:37,722
Josephine! Wait for me.

1108
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,516
This night was a tribute to my father,

1109
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:42,143
but you had to ruin it
with your grandstanding.

1110
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,313
Josephine, I'm sorry.
Very sorry.

1111
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:48,858
Maybe it's wasn't my father who
wrote it. But you got no proof.

1112
01:14:48,943 --> 01:14:51,361
Stop telling it to everyone.
It makes you look ridiculous.

1113
01:14:51,362 --> 01:14:52,737
Do you realize the consequences?

1114
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:56,366
You just can't face reality.
You're deluding yourself.

1115
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:59,494
My reality is that my father died
in a state when he no longer

1116
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:01,621
recognized neither his wife,
nor his daughter.

1117
01:15:01,706 --> 01:15:03,748
My mother almost died of grief.

1118
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,876
So deluding oneself, as you call it,
is just a mean to survive.

1119
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,505
But I need you to finish
this investigation.

1120
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:14,009
- You're like my Dr. Watson.
- Why are you Sherlock Holmes?

1121
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,886
- Because it's my investigation.
- But Henri Pick was my father.

1122
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,221
Good night.

1123
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,189
- What are you doing here?
- I'm coming with you.

1124
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:31,443
- I'm going home, to Crozon.
- Very good. Wonderful.

1125
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,612
After tonight's mess,
I think it's best for me

1126
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,823
to leave Paris as soon as possible.

1127
01:15:36,949 --> 01:15:39,075
You're impossible!

1128
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:46,249
Here's a thought: Magali Roze,

1129
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:49,127
the librarian. I think
she knows something.

1130
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:52,505
I think you're right.
I need to know the truth.

1131
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,133
I need to know who my father was.

1132
01:15:57,136 --> 01:15:59,220
Do I smell weed on you?
You smoked?

1133
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:00,513
Not at all!

1134
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:03,349
Your eyes are all red.
You're completely stoned.

1135
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:05,393
I haven't smoked since college.

1136
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,355
OK. Buckle up.

1137
01:16:10,357 --> 01:16:13,735
Damn, it'll be a nice trip. How many
hours do we have on the road?

1138
01:16:14,195 --> 01:16:15,862
Please don't talk.

1139
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,615
Don't you wanna take a nap?

1140
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:23,953
The Girl from Siberia,
that rings the bell?

1141
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:27,582
You knew that Jean-Pierre Gourvec
wrote a novel, didn't you?

1142
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:30,752
Yes, when he died,
I gathered his things

1143
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,504
to give them to his cousin,

1144
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,256
and I found this manuscript
in his desk drawer.

1145
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:40,345
- That title alone!
- That means he didn't change it!

1146
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,763
Your theory doesn't hold.

1147
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:44,641
He could easily keep a copy
with the original title.

1148
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:47,894
You surely have a spirit for
contradiction. Where's the manuscript?

1149
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:51,606
I burned it.

1150
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:54,109
You did what?

1151
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,944
I burned it!

1152
01:16:57,363 --> 01:16:59,989
I couldn't bear that he wrote
a whole book about her.

1153
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,324
You burned it!

1154
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:05,870
Magali, it's unthinkable
to burn a book!

1155
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,624
Usually, it's the Nazis
who burn books.

1156
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,753
- You were in love with him?
- Well, yes.

1157
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:17,090
But at least, you'd read it
before burning?

1158
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:19,008
No. I couldn't bring myself.

1159
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:22,846
I thought he loved me.
I really did.

1160
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:31,187
But, actually, he never
forgot that other woman.

1161
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:35,108
Did he type it on
his Hermes 3000?

1162
01:17:35,192 --> 01:17:37,986
- Yes, of course.
- Have you seen the letter K?

1163
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:40,363
Look.

1164
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:43,992
The lower diagonal part is missing.

1165
01:17:45,619 --> 01:17:46,828
So what?

1166
01:17:46,871 --> 01:17:50,373
I have to go to your mother's
to see the original manuscript.

1167
01:17:50,875 --> 01:17:53,751
No way. She won't let you in.

1168
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,964
Stop making that face!

1169
01:18:01,719 --> 01:18:03,386
- Well?
- Wait.

1170
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,222
You'll see. She's like
a Swiss cuckoo clock.

1171
01:18:08,142 --> 01:18:11,269
3, 2, 1 ...

1172
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:14,606
Oh, yes!

1173
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:20,737
Yes, she's obsessive.

1174
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,326
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1175
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:31,122
Really! It's like the Zeus temple
in Pergamon.

1176
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:34,334
Did I give you the permission
to mock me? I don't think so.

1177
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:39,339
Look at the K!
It has the same flaw!

1178
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:42,759
Here's the proof. This
manuscript was typed

1179
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:47,013
on Gourvec's typewriter
and not on your father's.

1180
01:18:50,017 --> 01:18:52,477
- Check.
- That's what I'm doing.

1181
01:18:56,190 --> 01:19:00,193
- Bravo! What insight!
- Oh, shit!

1182
01:19:00,861 --> 01:19:02,362
This is the typewriter.

1183
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:04,614
I don't get it.

1184
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:06,991
Maybe they wrote it together,
like Lagarde and Michard.

1185
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:09,327
Excuse me.

1186
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,331
This is the copy from the library!

1187
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:17,335
Gourvec must've given it to your
father along with the typewriter!

1188
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:20,755
To make everyone believe that
Pick was the author!

1189
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,341
- It's odd.
- What?

1190
01:19:23,384 --> 01:19:27,262
The ink should've been dry. The typewriter
has been in the cellar for years.

1191
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:28,513
So?

1192
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:30,515
It means someone replaced the tape.

1193
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:33,643
But who did this?
It's incomprehensible.

1194
01:19:33,644 --> 01:19:36,354
In any case, not Gourvec.
He's been dead for over 10 years,

1195
01:19:36,355 --> 01:19:39,357
- so your theory collapses.
- Not only my theory collapses.

1196
01:19:39,817 --> 01:19:41,109
I'm collapsing.

1197
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:43,069
I'm at the end of the rope.

1198
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,571
I'm completely in the dark.

1199
01:19:45,990 --> 01:19:47,448
Gourvec's cousin.

1200
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,826
Maybe he can enlighten us.

1201
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:52,870
His what?

1202
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:56,082
His typewriter, Hermes 3000.

1203
01:19:56,250 --> 01:20:00,461
Oh, yes. Jean-Pierre
treasured it.

1204
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:03,339
But I sold it.

1205
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,884
On a garage sale, after
I'd found it in his house.

1206
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:11,264
There were so many things
I didn't need.

1207
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:15,893
- Remember whom you sold it to?
- Oh, hold on.

1208
01:20:18,105 --> 01:20:21,858
Some local guy, but who?

1209
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:26,988
Take your time. It's very important.

1210
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:33,703
What did he look like? Small
or big? He had a mustache?

1211
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:38,958
- Normal, a family guy.
- He was with his children?

1212
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:43,254
- No, why?
- You said he was a family guy.

1213
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,630
Really?

1214
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:47,008
Why did I say that?

1215
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:49,886
Well, I don't know.

1216
01:20:51,388 --> 01:20:53,097
Yes, I remember.

1217
01:20:53,766 --> 01:20:58,227
It was a present for his daughter.
For her birthday, I think.

1218
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,355
Oh, really?

1219
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,608
I never got a typewriter
for my birthday.

1220
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,237
You said he was a local guy.
Why did you say that?

1221
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,114
Because he was on a bicycle.

1222
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,701
So I offered to deliver
the typewriter to him.

1223
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,996
If you delivered the typewriter,
you know where he lives.

1224
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:19,874
- Well, yes.
- Why didn't you tell us right away?

1225
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,585
You asked me who he was,
not where he lived.

1226
01:21:22,628 --> 01:21:24,087
So where does he live?

1227
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:26,756
In the last house on the tip of...

1228
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,383
Where?

1229
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,890
- Nurse?
- We have a problem.

1230
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:38,017
Wait.

1231
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:41,979
Here you go.

1232
01:21:43,065 --> 01:21:45,191
The last house on the tip of...

1233
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:47,735
We'll never succeed.

1234
01:21:47,820 --> 01:21:51,114
- Let's try to read his lips.
- The lips, sure!

1235
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,492
- Pen Hir!
- Pen Hir!

1236
01:21:54,493 --> 01:21:56,119
Pen Hir Point.

1237
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:04,001
- It's Gerard Despero, the bookseller.
- Daphne's father?

1238
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,461
Yes!

1239
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:12,760
Hello.

1240
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:19,267
Mr. Despero, you gave your daughter
a typewriter for her birthday?

1241
01:22:19,601 --> 01:22:21,894
Yes, so?

1242
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:27,608
- The noose tightens...
- Stop harassing my daughter.

1243
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:30,736
What do you want? To make
her lose her job? Leave her alone!

1244
01:22:30,737 --> 01:22:34,490
You're not gonna threaten us
with the hoe?

1245
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:39,328
It's a weeding hoe, with two prongs
on the other end of the blade.

1246
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:44,459
Whatever. Anyway, you said
what I wanted to know.

1247
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:52,008
Daphne Despero. It's shocking.

1248
01:22:52,134 --> 01:22:54,135
Daphne Despero...

1249
01:22:54,761 --> 01:22:58,514
- Do you think she wrote the book?
- No idea.

1250
01:22:58,765 --> 01:23:01,642
But sometimes the solution is so
obvious you don't see it.

1251
01:23:02,019 --> 01:23:05,229
Like in Poe's The Purloined Letter.
After all, it was under our noses.

1252
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:06,355
Exactly.

1253
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:09,692
We have to go back to Paris,
and to talk to Daphne Despero.

1254
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:11,569
Without me, Jean-Michel.

1255
01:23:11,612 --> 01:23:13,988
The vacation is over,
I'll take back Melville tonight,

1256
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,116
and the kids from my class tomorrow.
Wouldn't be better to stop here?

1257
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,993
But we're so close to the end.

1258
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:23,372
You just came and are leaving again.
When will you stop running?

1259
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,751
Get yourself a good book.
Sit in the sun.

1260
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:29,086
Exactly as I thought:
You're crazy about me.

1261
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:31,839
You don't want me to leave.
Yes, yes!

1262
01:23:32,966 --> 01:23:36,135
I thought you were ready
to face the truth.

1263
01:23:36,887 --> 01:23:39,263
Sure I am. But my mother...

1264
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:41,516
It's funny this obsession
with...

1265
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:44,018
No, please! Let's not
start again with my mother.

1266
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,103
- You have...
- I don't like you talking about her.

1267
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:48,606
- I don't mean to meddle, but...
- I don't want to.

1268
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,108
- Simply...
- I don't want to.

1269
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,444
- Great neurosis.
- Jean-Michel!

1270
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,988
OK, what do we do?

1271
01:23:56,114 --> 01:23:58,366
Promise to keep me updated.
Me first.

1272
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,575
But of course.

1273
01:23:59,993 --> 01:24:03,120
- I'll drop you at the station.
- I don't mind taking the train.

1274
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:07,708
- At the bus station.
- You have a difficult character.

1275
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,494
Hello.

1276
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:46,247
- Hello.
- I'll be back.

1277
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,376
How are you?

1278
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,336
What are you doing here?

1279
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:56,090
Your father gave you
a Hermes 3000 typewriter

1280
01:24:56,133 --> 01:24:58,467
which is exactly the same
as Henri Pick's.

1281
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:01,721
Come with me.

1282
01:25:03,515 --> 01:25:07,268
So what? There are many of those.

1283
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:13,482
Yes, but the manuscript was typed
on this very Hermes 3000.

1284
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:14,942
I have the proof.

1285
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:19,739
My father got it at a flea market.
Anyone could've used it before.

1286
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:26,370
OK, but then explain why
it turned up in Pick's cellar.

1287
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:30,583
Listen, I'm very busy,
so please...

1288
01:25:30,626 --> 01:25:33,586
You can't always run,
Ms Daphne Despero.

1289
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,630
I'm not running, I'm doing my job,
that's all.

1290
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,842
OK, then I'll go to Ines de Crecy.
I'm sure she'll be interested.

1291
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:48,517
When I learned that Pick was
a pizza guy, not the writer type,

1292
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:50,645
I was afraid that no one
would believe it.

1293
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:53,731
So I decided to improve
my chances.

1294
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:56,108
So you went down to
Madeleine Pick's cellar

1295
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:58,235
to plant there your old typewriter

1296
01:25:58,236 --> 01:25:59,987
and a copy of Eugene Onegin?

1297
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:01,238
Yes.

1298
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:05,242
But I swear I really found it
in the library of rejected books.

1299
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:07,244
How do I know you didn't
plant it there?

1300
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:09,872
Go check it out. Ask the
librarian.

1301
01:26:09,873 --> 01:26:11,999
I'm surprised
you haven't done it yet.

1302
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:14,502
And besides, I didn't even
have a bag with me.

1303
01:26:14,711 --> 01:26:17,129
Where would I hide the manuscript?
In my panties?

1304
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:19,632
I really have to go back.
I've a lot of work to do.

1305
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:22,843
Henri Pick took his secret
to the grave. Accept it.

1306
01:26:34,856 --> 01:26:38,234
- Here, Mr. Rouche, your Papa Doble.
- Thanks, Julien.

1307
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:44,490
Is everything OK?
You seem to be elsewhere.

1308
01:26:45,075 --> 01:26:46,617
I'm completely lost.

1309
01:26:47,369 --> 01:26:50,705
I have the impression
I'm back to square one.

1310
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:57,253
Bravo, Henri Pick.
Here's to you.

1311
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,744
THE BATHTUB
If some day you're curious...

1312
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:31,871
Yours friendly, Frederic Koska.

1313
01:27:53,477 --> 01:27:55,019
That little jerk!

1314
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:00,441
I can't believe it!

1315
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:11,952
Good morning. Take a seat.
It's nice of you to come.

1316
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:14,121
Thanks for having read it at last.

1317
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,457
Did you like it?

1318
01:28:17,626 --> 01:28:19,376
Yes. Yes.

1319
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,754
It's very good for a first novel.

1320
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,715
But your second novel
is even better.

1321
01:28:26,343 --> 01:28:29,261
You've made progress with
The Last Hours of a Love Story.

1322
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:32,014
You've deepened your style.

1323
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:36,519
Your signature
which also betrays you.

1324
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:39,230
And your obsessions,
your themes:

1325
01:28:39,356 --> 01:28:45,486
Subjectivity, the clash
between reality and fiction.

1326
01:28:45,612 --> 01:28:48,489
Your penchant for using
free indirect style,

1327
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,698
your rhetorical figures.

1328
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:52,576
But what I'd like to understand
is why Henri Pick?

1329
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,996
Why this library
of rejected books?

1330
01:28:57,499 --> 01:28:59,750
Why all this mystification?

1331
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:01,627
Why?

1332
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:03,754
For the game's sake.

1333
01:29:04,965 --> 01:29:06,215
By chance.

1334
01:29:07,384 --> 01:29:09,093
For love, I think.

1335
01:29:09,886 --> 01:29:12,137
My first book's failure
struck me down.

1336
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,348
I was sure Daphne would dump me

1337
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,767
because in her eyes
I was just a loser.

1338
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,520
Then I imagined the story
of our break-up,

1339
01:29:19,563 --> 01:29:21,814
to ward off my fear
of losing her.

1340
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,817
And, like the poet Pushkin,

1341
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,111
I predicted in my novel
what was gonna happen to me.

1342
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:31,574
I lost Daphne. Probably
because of my Russian roots,

1343
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,868
fatalism runs through my veins.

1344
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:37,079
Last year, I spent
a few days in Crozon.

1345
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:40,875
I took my text with me to re-read it
and to make some corrections.

1346
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:43,752
And when her father told us
about that library,

1347
01:29:43,879 --> 01:29:47,381
I thought it would be
a unique occasion to test Daphne.

1348
01:29:47,716 --> 01:29:50,342
- Is this library still there?
- I think so.

1349
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:53,012
Let's go there tomorrow.
I'd really like to see it.

1350
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:55,514
I worked on my plan all night.

1351
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:58,267
Just like a gangster
preparing a big heist.

1352
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:01,437
The only thing missing
was my pen name.

1353
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:04,732
So why did I take the name
of a ghost?

1354
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,484
Daphne used to joke that
she liked authors starting with K.

1355
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:10,738
Kafka, Kleist, Kundera, Koska.

1356
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,616
I only found one with a K:
Henri Pick.

1357
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,495
And used a red folder to draw
her attention.

1358
01:30:27,631 --> 01:30:29,506
Then it was enough to place

1359
01:30:29,633 --> 01:30:32,509
the manuscript strategically
at her eye level.

1360
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:35,638
And maybe with a little luck...

1361
01:30:40,894 --> 01:30:42,770
I confess it gave me a great pleasure

1362
01:30:42,771 --> 01:30:44,563
to re-read my book
in front of Daphne.

1363
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,942
- Well?
- I feel like killing myself.

1364
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:52,696
- What do you think?
- It's intense, gripping!

1365
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:55,366
It's exactly for this kind of
discoveries that I chose this job!

1366
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,994
It's the book I've dreamed of
publishing and I'm gonna publish it!

1367
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,330
What? What's wrong with you?

1368
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,248
It happens that "Pick" is me.

1369
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,126
But why did you do that?

1370
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:10,756
Because I had lost confidence
in myself, in her.

1371
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:14,343
I wanted to know if she really
thought I had talent,

1372
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,845
or she published me
just because she was in love.

1373
01:31:17,764 --> 01:31:21,517
- So you've tricked me.
- You don't hate me?

1374
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:25,562
No, because, unwittingly,
you came up with a fabulous idea.

1375
01:31:25,605 --> 01:31:26,814
How come?

1376
01:31:26,856 --> 01:31:29,483
Imagine, a lost masterpiece
on the shelf

1377
01:31:29,609 --> 01:31:31,568
of a library of rejected books!

1378
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,946
- What a story!
- A masterpiece, really?

1379
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,864
We must publish it as it is.

1380
01:31:36,616 --> 01:31:40,244
- I don't understand. You mean...?
- We'll publish it under Pick's name.

1381
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:43,998
If my novel is good, why
to hide that I'm the author?

1382
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,960
- It's stupid!
- Fred, your book is great.

1383
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:51,005
But the marketing idea behind it
is even more brilliant.

1384
01:31:51,131 --> 01:31:54,341
You know, nowadays it's increasingly
difficult to stand out.

1385
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,760
Moreover, with The Bathtub's
failure it'll be even harder.

1386
01:31:56,761 --> 01:31:59,596
- It was just a joke, Daphne!
- But maybe I know.

1387
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:03,475
However, my excitement when
I found this treasure was incredible.

1388
01:32:03,601 --> 01:32:06,186
That's what we should give to people:
This whole story around it.

1389
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:09,606
- No, we don't need that.
- Listen, I'll publish it.

1390
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,316
It'll work, I'm sure.

1391
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,861
After that, you'll write
the story of the novel.

1392
01:32:13,862 --> 01:32:16,071
You'll explain the real
origins of the thing.

1393
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,615
And the revelation that Pick is you
will be in the form

1394
01:32:18,616 --> 01:32:20,617
of a new novel, it'll be
a new success.

1395
01:32:20,994 --> 01:32:23,245
I don't like your plan. Frankly...

1396
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,707
it's absurd! Please,
let's do it properly.

1397
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:29,126
And end up in the shredder?

1398
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:32,629
Please! I assure you! Trust me!

1399
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,014
The typewriter was her idea.

1400
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:45,642
She wanted authenticity, and retyped
the manuscript that night.

1401
01:32:46,603 --> 01:32:48,103
What Daphne considered brilliant

1402
01:32:48,188 --> 01:32:50,439
was that Pick was a simple
pizza maker.

1403
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,566
What's Mrs. Pick name?

1404
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,985
M for Madeleine.

1405
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,945
Everyone could identify with him.

1406
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,698
There wouldn't be that barrier
of intellectual elitism.

1407
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:02,076
But for Pick to be
credible as the author,

1408
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:04,578
a few additional elements
were needed.

1409
01:33:04,621 --> 01:33:07,998
- The Bathrobe?
- No, The Bathtub, by Frederic Koska.

1410
01:33:08,333 --> 01:33:09,958
I've never heard of it.

1411
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:12,586
However, it had some
critical success.

1412
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:19,968
Maybe you could order it?

1413
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:26,475
The book was a big hit.

1414
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:29,812
Daphne was right, it went
well above our expectations.

1415
01:33:30,814 --> 01:33:34,858
And I did what she told me.
I wrote the story of the novel.

1416
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,611
The Revelation.

1417
01:33:38,822 --> 01:33:41,323
Then all this completely
overtook us...

1418
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:42,991
Why did you lie to me?

1419
01:33:43,118 --> 01:33:44,326
Almost destroying us.

1420
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:47,371
You never wanted to reveal me
as the author, I know now.

1421
01:33:47,372 --> 01:33:48,497
It's too late.

1422
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:51,875
If we reveal the truth now,
we'll look as great manipulators.

1423
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,585
It was your idea,

1424
01:33:53,711 --> 01:33:55,712
I accepted it, and
followed you blindly.

1425
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,506
You used me.
You're the manipulator.

1426
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:01,343
You started all this.
You tricked me, don't forget.

1427
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:04,221
You think that I'll accept it
silently?

1428
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,765
That I'll be happy to
be a failed novelist?

1429
01:34:06,891 --> 01:34:09,101
I don't care. I'll expose
everything.

1430
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,062
But you'll be able to
write many other books!

1431
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:17,609
If you do that, I'm finished!
It's my whole life, Fred!

1432
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:25,993
Come here.

1433
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,011
This is it.

1434
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:49,099
Now you know all about...
the mystery of Henri Pick.

1435
01:34:56,608 --> 01:34:58,859
How do you envision the follow-up?

1436
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:04,740
I have no idea.

1437
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:08,577
It's a matter of chance, I guess.

1438
01:35:09,871 --> 01:35:11,121
And you?

1439
01:35:17,337 --> 01:35:19,630
See you on Monday.
Have a good weekend.

1440
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,006
You'll do it, right?

1441
01:35:21,507 --> 01:35:23,008
Have a good weekend!

1442
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:25,010
See you.

1443
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:45,239
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon!

1444
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:46,615
How are you?

1445
01:35:47,575 --> 01:35:48,951
You came here to read?

1446
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,620
I feel like Chateaubriand.

1447
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:54,623
It's Brittany...
The power of the elements...

1448
01:35:56,251 --> 01:36:00,963
- What are you reading?
- An extraordinary first novel.

1449
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,631
I heard about it.

1450
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:05,467
You know that the author
refuses any interviews,

1451
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:07,886
or meetings with the press?

1452
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:09,846
It's a bit odd, isn't it?

1453
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:12,140
It's true, it makes you wonder.

1454
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:15,644
Why an artist of such caliber,
such a promising talent,

1455
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:19,481
would hide like a hunted animal?

1456
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:22,359
It's mysterious.
