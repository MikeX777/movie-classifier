1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,433
Dad.

2
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,439
Dad.

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,439
Dad.

4
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,997
Joesoef.
- Dad.

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,832
Joesoef.

6
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,711
Where's my dad?

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,911
KNOW YOURSELF

8
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,477
Joesoef... Joesoef.

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,232
What about the goats?

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,152
Go and find them.

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,229
You too, Hamid.

12
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,115
Hamid. The goats have run off.
- What?

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,434
The goats. They're still
in the hills. Oh, my Lord.

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,432
For heaven's sake, get going.

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,035
Joesoef. I'm tired, friend.
Can we have a bit of a rest?

16
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,829
Yes, but we must be back
before dark.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,672
No problem.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,152
I'm going to have a look up there.
- What for?

19
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,955
I'm going to take a crap, that's all.

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,474
You take care of the goats.

21
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:37,158
Dear son. Look at this.
The Netherlands.

22
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,158
Up there you can see
the whole of Rotterdam.

23
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,954
Fond regards, Dad.

24
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,633
Dad?

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,233
Dad?

26
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,388
Uncle Hamid. Uncle Hamid.

27
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,152
Where are the goats?

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,153
Wake up, Uncle.
Where have the goats gone?

29
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,113
They're... What the?

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,034
You let them escape, stupid.
- I'll look over there.

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,958
Where are you going?

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,480
I'll go that way.
- OK.

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,591
What have you done, silly?
Now we've lost all our money.

34
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,390
We're sorry.
We'll make up for it.

35
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,950
Hamid and I will look for them.
- Sure.

36
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,157
Make sure you find those goats.

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,799
Or get us the money.

38
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:44,509
Don't dare come back
before you've found them.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,116
What's up, cousin?

40
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,998
Will we ever find those goats?

41
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,597
Are you asking me?
How should I know?

42
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,079
Perhaps over there?
- But there's nothing out there.

43
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,753
How should I know?

44
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,678
Come on.

45
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,954
This is the story
about my son Joes.

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,716
They never found the goats.
So they had to find money.

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,111
Their search brought them
to The Netherlands.

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,158
The President

49
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,630
So the story is
about your country too, Holland.

50
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,473
Imagine the country
five years later.

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,510
Everything's the same. The traffic
jams, the trains are still late.

52
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,672
They still have croquettes.

53
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,751
And coffee shops.

54
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,958
Typical. They lose the
championschips but still party.

55
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,752
Holland in five years had enough
of all the political compromises.

56
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,832
Democracy was done away with.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,151
The Netherlands wanted
a president.

58
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,392
But it's not easy selecting
a president.

59
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,714
Two months before Election Day
there were two candidates left.

60
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,950
On one side Mrs Heesters.

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,671
I want to be quite clear and
tell all these immigrants:

62
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,913
There's a limit to our hospitality.

63
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,039
And we've reached that limit.

64
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,875
And trailing behind
on the other side: Fred Vlonder.

65
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,431
Former businessman and
successful owner of outlet stores.

66
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,352
Keep smiling.

67
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,031
What about illegal immigrants?
- What a good question.

68
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,509
Don't go into that.
He's trouble.

69
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,559
It means being
in a society illegally.

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,110
It's a problem we must...

71
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,669
Fuck off, you liar.

72
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,159
The elections came to a halt.
There were riots.

73
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,472
Everyone wondered if anyone
could still save the country.

74
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,676
A real leader.

75
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,308
Where was that ray of sunshine?

76
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,994
A strike, being on strike...

77
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,551
Stop working temporarily
to take over the power.

78
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,039
I've cut my finger, damn.

79
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,838
I hate this job.

80
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,231
Talk Dutch. How long
have we been here for?

81
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,235
OK. I hate this mud, I hate these
white carrots and I hate you.

82
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,359
Why? Shame on you. I love you
the same way I love my father.

83
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,351
If I wasnt so...

84
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:50,479
So what? You never finish your
sentences. What do you mean?

85
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,835
Listen to my plan.

86
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,993
We must go.
- Where to? We need the money.

87
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,390
Let's do other things.
A different job.

88
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,430
Let's work at a disco. Lots of girls.
We could stand at the door.

89
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,958
It's Ladies' Night tonight.
It's just us here. Come in, girls.

90
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,590
Let's stop working temporarily.

91
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,593
You, me, Bekir, the Bulgarians,
all of us.

92
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,228
Work with the Bulgarians?
They're evil.

93
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,231
Look at the dog face.

94
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,109
The Bulgarians are no good.
Look it up in your book.

95
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,674
Hello Mum, what's up?
- Where's the money, son?

96
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,515
Hello, Asparagus firm
'Hamid, Put it in, Take it out'.

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,472
I've got to go, Mum.

98
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,988
Leave him alone.
Let him go.

99
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,833
Go fuck your mother.

100
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,073
What do you want?
- We're pulling out carrots here.

101
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,435
4 euros 95.
- So what do you want, Allah?

102
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,794
What do you want?
- Pederast.

103
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,796
Keep working you.
Bunch of creeps.

104
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,799
What's this?

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,232
What are you up to?
Where you actually working?

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,594
No good.
- Asshole.

107
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,999
Reading is no good.
- I'm not working anymore.

108
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,668
Guys, stop working. Stop.

109
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,751
OK, it's about an hour's walk.
See you later, sand niggers.

110
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,877
Yo dizzy.

111
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,952
No, you dizzy.
- Yo dizzy, ass.

112
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,595
Never mind, friend.
It doesn't matter.

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,950
You know...

114
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,431
It's not us who stink,
it's the world, the Dutch say.

115
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,551
This must change or I'll kick you
out. You know what that means.

116
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,154
Hello, girls.

117
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,388
Your skirts having a break too?
Feel like a vodka later on?

118
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,790
I'll be waiting for you.

119
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,669
What the hell is this?
Hey!

120
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:11,234
Tomorrow at 7 o'clock sharp
or I'll take you to the police.

121
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,358
Get lost, you asshole.

122
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,309
Let me go. Don't touch me.

123
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,152
Let her go.

124
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,799
You asshole. Let her go.

125
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,511
OK. You heard what
the gentleman said: Let her go.

126
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,510
Because you have no papers.

127
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,749
Everyone inside. And quickly.

128
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:35,434
Come on, friend. Let's go.

129
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,153
Osama, what are you still doing
out here?

130
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,153
Piss off, dog breath.

131
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,310
You jerk. What do you want?

132
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,909
Cheers.

133
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,118
Be careful, Uncle.

134
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,829
They're drunk already.
I'm going to win. You'll see.

135
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,671
Hey, wake up, Uncle.

136
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,032
Uncle Hamid, wake up.

137
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,752
It seems
prime-minister Heesters...

138
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,595
wants to carry out her eviction
policy before the election.

139
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,230
In plain language:
a boundary is a boundary.

140
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,915
We've just got to carry out
the evictions.

141
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,834
You're a long way behind.
Is this the end of your career?

142
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,471
No, of course not.
And I think that...

143
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,553
It's just a dip.
- Sorry, no comment right now.

144
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,277
Our special program
for all you immigrants.

145
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,113
This is Plop the Ball.

146
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:15,749
Plop the Ball. Plop the Ball.

147
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,479
Kommolotien.

148
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,036
Kommolotien.

149
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,630
Plop the Ball.

150
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,909
Calm down, Zidane.

151
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,071
Sit.
Calm down, Zidane.

152
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,912
Get back in your kennel.

153
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,994
Barking dogs don't bite.

154
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,192
Barking dogs don't bite?

155
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,237
Usually they don't.

156
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,395
The brothers are pigs.
You understand?

157
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,830
The brother Kees...

158
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,591
Pigs.

159
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,193
Where are you from?
- Slatina, Rumania.

160
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,393
I'm Joes from El Machroub,
Morocco.

161
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,796
The funny thing is
that it isn't much better at home.

162
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,708
You're strong. I can see
in your eyes that you're strong.

163
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,235
You can do anything you like.

164
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,632
Give me some money
and I'll read your hand.

165
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,430
No, that's not true.

166
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:11,875
Something spectacular
is going to happen to you.

167
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,713
Be careful with your heart.

168
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,109
What's your name?
- Mila.

169
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,596
You're a dreamer.

170
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,395
Kommolotien.

171
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,995
Police. Police.

172
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,839
Any illegal immigrants in there?

173
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,438
What are you doing?
- They can't come in now.

174
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,955
But we can't get out.

175
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,677
My vodka.

176
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:10,956
Take your foul hands off me.
This is a legal business.

177
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,799
What a bunch of chickens
you are. I'll put it out.

178
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,271
Where is Mila?

179
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,117
She's still inside.

180
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,353
Let me go.

181
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,476
Joesoef, come back.

182
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,478
Mila.

183
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:53,795
Joesoef Ha is a young
Moroccan asparagus cutter.

184
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,713
He came into action
while others stood by.

185
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,829
He couragously saved the life
of a policeman.

186
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,155
Joesoef my brother, you're alive.

187
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,516
Calm down, calm down.
You're on TV.

188
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,035
He's awake.
Joes, our hero.

189
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,635
No questions, just photos,
ladies and gentlemen.

190
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,238
Congratulations
on your speedy recovery.

191
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,996
I'm so happy to be able
to shake your hand.

192
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,516
That was all. Thank you.
- That's all. Thank you.

193
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,433
No press. No press, please.
Turn it off.

194
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,878
What a wonderful thing
you've done for our country.

195
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,033
I always say: One day without
attention of the press is like...

196
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,749
I haven't even introduced myself.
How rude.

197
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,593
Gert Vlonder.
Candidate to the presidency.

198
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,320
This is my media adviser Aart.
- You OK?

199
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,233
Of course he isn't.
- Silly of me.

200
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:08,110
What's all this about?
- Here you are. Fond regards.

201
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,479
Is this mine? That's great.
Thank you very much.

202
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,958
Joesoef Ha?

203
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,552
His name is Hasani.

204
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,349
He asked me your last name.
I started to say H...

205
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,272
He quickly wrote down Ha.

206
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,116
I said, hold on. I'm Hamid H...
So I'm Ha Ha.

207
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,196
What's he saying?
- No idea.

208
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,397
Look at my date of birth.
11 September?

209
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,314
11 September is the day
that you can light your candle

210
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,119
That's 11 November.
- Saint Maarten.

211
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,829
Oh, that's in November.
- Thanks.

212
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,673
Stick around.
- Look.

213
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,229
ILLEGAL PERSON RISKS
HIS LIFE

214
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,755
A NATIONAL HERO
IS BORN

215
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,913
A GREAT EXAMPLE. MODERN
HERO. Even: MOROCCAN HERO.

216
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,469
Where?
- On page 3.

217
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,632
Where is Mila?
Look, her.

218
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,713
I want to see her
and say hello.

219
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,553
We haven't actually been able
to... save her.

220
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,957
It's hard for me to tell you
but she's gone to the other side.

221
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,231
What's he saying?
- I don't get it.

222
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,879
Is she dead?

223
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,474
Dead, yes. That's what I was
trying to say.

224
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,358
Is she...

225
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,759
Dead.

226
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,679
Is she dead? No.
- Yes.

227
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,711
But this is about you, Joes.
We believe in you.

228
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,911
We want to make you a proposal.

229
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,552
We want you to be
on the list of candidates.

230
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,235
No, we want you to be
our running mate.

231
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,358
You want him
as your running mate?

232
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,557
He says
you'll be their running mate.

233
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,075
Running mate.
That's... Mate, running.

234
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,870
We fled, the police were after us.
Now you'll be their running mate.

235
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,749
There are millions of chicks
in this sea. You get it?

236
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,229
All for the grabbing, Joes.

237
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,356
Don't bother. Thanks anyway.

238
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,431
Are you sure?

239
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:59,478
We can stay friends.
But not too close.

240
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,270
Morocco isn't my favourite.
And that's where you'll be going.

241
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,591
Give him the passport.
You're frightening him.

242
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,279
It means going back home.
To a lot of sand and goats.

243
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,432
Think of the money
we can send your mum.

244
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,357
Will he have a salary?
- Sorry? Salad?

245
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,548
Salary? Of course he will.
Did you hear salad too?

246
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,075
And a car?

247
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,518
Ladies and gentlemen,
here is our hero of the day.

248
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,877
He's my running mate,
Joesoef Ha.

249
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,473
On top or Underneath.

250
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,710
It's best to start at the bottom.

251
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,515
The reason we have
such a bad reputation...

252
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,958
has everything to do
with the mismanagement...

253
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:15,510
of our former prime-minister
Ursula Heesters.

254
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,710
I want to create a basic principle
for a normal society.

255
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:26,715
A society with courage.
- Take it easy.

256
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,715
Our slogan is:
On top or Underneath.

257
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,678
You're looking smart.

258
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,358
Turn around.
- Why?

259
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,149
Turn around, man.
Show me.

260
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,110
Come here, please. Perhaps
he's a better running mate.

261
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:49,512
Him? And we tell people
he was the hero?

262
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,558
They all look alike anyway.

263
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,473
You Dutch all look the same too.

264
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,518
Yes, yes. In cleverness
and brilliance.

265
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,798
No, when on holiday in our country
and being intolerant.

266
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,351
You come over to get a tan
but you don't like brown people.

267
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,717
Hello, Mum.
- It's me, Hadj Mustafa.

268
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,314
Hello.
- We're proud of you, Joesoef.

269
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,278
When are you sending
some money?

270
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,517
I heard Internet banking
is very fast.

271
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,035
Don't make your mother wait.
- No, no.

272
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,589
You've made us all happy.
- Fine.

273
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,196
How's my son? Tell him
he can do what he wants.

274
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,070
As long as he doesn't come back.
- OK, I have to go. Bye.

275
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,595
Nice car, isn't it?

276
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,719
Real leather?
- Pig's leather.

277
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,115
What does a running mate do?
- Nothing at all.

278
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:10,431
Just smile a lot
and we do all the work.

279
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,751
One thing, Joes.
Never ask a voter what he wants.

280
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,798
What would you say
if I asked you what you wanted?

281
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,474
He'd say Mira.
- I'm asking him.

282
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:27,433
If you'd ask me I'd say: A Ferrari,
Versace, Gucci, Rolex, yo Dizzy?

283
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,636
Yo Dizzy?
- Yes.

284
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,839
See? Everyone wants something.
Don't give people a choice.

285
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,117
Exactly.
Everyone wants something.

286
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,314
Could you please stop
doing that?

287
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,233
Just don't ask people.

288
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,038
Never become concrete. Never.
It causes hell.

289
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,195
You are our sweetest
ray of sunshine.

290
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,158
Sweetest ray of sunshine...

291
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,997
Don't say anything about asylum
rights. Just avoid the subject.

292
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,995
I think the lady likes a bit of culture.
- I'd like something to drink.

293
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,832
What's all this dandruff?

294
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,595
It won't work that way.
We don't operate on just one policy.

295
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,398
We'll have to win first.

296
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,393
Of course we want to fill
Heesters' gaps.

297
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,190
The gaps she created.
But it takes drastic... Hey.

298
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,231
Drastic measures.

299
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,393
But once we've won we'll have to
see if we still want the same.

300
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:54,190
If I understand correctly you're
telling us you have no opinion.

301
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,549
You're not saying anything.
- You're not listening, silly.

302
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,157
Let me rephrase that. I think it's silly
to think on a small scale.

303
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,992
Are you listening?

304
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,630
Negative thinking is like
driving on the wrong side.

305
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,316
You lose touch with the advantages
of staying on the right side.

306
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,395
Next question. Your running mate,
Joesoef Ha, is very popular.

307
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,632
What will his role be?
- Joesoef Ha?

308
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:28,190
He's going to advise me
on human aspects.

309
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,635
He's a Moroccan,
a people's man.

310
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,039
What do you mean exactly?
- We'll be discussing everything.

311
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,236
Exactly?
- I'm going to enjoy it.

312
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,757
Know what? I'll ask him myself.
Because he's here. Joesoef Ha.

313
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,951
Hold on.
He isn't prepared.

314
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,596
This wasn't planned...
Welcome.

315
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,912
What's your role after the election?
- Good question. I...

316
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,029
May I? I'm sorry?
I'm asking Mr. Ha.

317
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,512
What about the traffic-jams?
- Traffic-jams? Yes.

318
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,037
Traffic-jams...

319
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,470
Congestion...

320
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,918
The flow of blood to your heart
stops. Shortness of breath.

321
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,959
Your head... There's pressure.

322
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,033
You feel you want to go home.
- What I mean...

323
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,196
I can say all sorts of things,
but it won't be of any help.

324
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,753
You can't save a goat
from drowning.

325
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,789
A cow from the well
and the sheep from the dyke.

326
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,678
Wind it up.

327
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,434
That's my uncle.
- Oh, great.

328
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:01,034
He hasn't got a girlfriend yet.

329
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,955
I don't know what you mean.
- Exactly. What would you do?

330
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,317
I'm a show host.
My opnion doesn't count.

331
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,910
No, no. My opinion doesn't count
in this issue. I'm not a candidate.

332
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,789
No one can solve the traffic-jam
problems on their own.

333
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,112
But we can together.
All of us together.

334
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,795
Together we can solve
all sorts of things.

335
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,672
You see?

336
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,470
Joesoef from Morocco?
He listens to us.

337
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:46,351
Joes is a great guy. He listens
to people. The others are liars.

338
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,556
He's so handsome.
- He's one of us.

339
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,110
He's not afraid to show
his vulnerable side.

340
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,829
Joes is our country.
It's our country too.

341
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,552
Vlonder is catching up. Running
mate Joesoef Ha is very popular.

342
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,915
His clear view on situations...

343
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,956
We've been talking a lot lately.
- You can say that again.

344
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,157
We want to...
May I?

345
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,199
We want you to become
a candidate for the presidency.

346
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,590
My cousin?
My cousin a president?

347
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,513
He's a candidate.
We're doubling our chances.

348
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,878
As there are three of us,
we'd better work together.

349
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,838
Divide and rule. You see?

350
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:52,597
So you can become a candidate
for the presidency of Holland.

351
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,514
It's an offer you can't
refuse.

352
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,592
Do you think he understands that?

353
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:05,231
When can my cousin start?
- What if he starts radicalizing?

354
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,315
What do you mean, caramelize?
You say such funny words.

355
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,835
Aart says...
- I said radicalize.

356
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,518
Why act so hostile towards him?
- I didn't say caramelize. Radicalize.

357
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,510
What if I don't want to?

358
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,277
There's no way back really. We're
almost as popular as Heesters.

359
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,353
If we don't do this...
- Our passports.

360
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,317
Exactly.
- For instance.

361
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,596
Do it for your mother.

362
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,593
That sounds beautiful.
- For his mother.

363
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,754
Pseudology.
- Pseudology.

364
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,435
Using imaginary experiences
as if they were real.

365
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,512
Sanguinic.
- Hothead.

366
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,517
I'm using plain language.

367
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:14,039
We can do it by sending people
back to where they belong.

368
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:19,320
Closing the borders.
Creating space and purity.

369
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:24,634
We have the means.
That's so important.

370
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,190
She's mad.
- In plain language.

371
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:31,796
What do the people think of this?

372
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,678
Rubbish.
- Rubbish?

373
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:38,709
It's quite an art to say nothing.
You'll never be under attack.

374
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,757
It's very clever, I must say.

375
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,199
You're not saying anything.
What do you say to that? Nothing?

376
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,794
I can hardly get a word in.

377
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,795
You're talking about interests.

378
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:00,991
You can only see what interests
there are if you're interested.

379
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,072
Interests, interesting.
It's the same.

380
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,632
Promises, promises.

381
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,917
You can't promise anything
if you don't believe in it.

382
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,719
You keep on promising things.

383
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,997
Do you believe in them?
I don't think so.

384
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,917
I can't promise you anything
but I believe in you.

385
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:28,471
I believe in you.
We're in this together.

386
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,952
You're going to do it. See?
Not just me on my own.

387
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,236
The guy's really good.
He has a feeling for languages.

388
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,391
Smile.
- Thank you very much.

389
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,992
It won't take long before we know
who our first president will be.

390
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,516
Most of the Dutch
seem to prefer Heesters.

391
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,832
But Joesoef's surprising
final sprint hasn't ended yet.

392
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,958
I've just received the latest figures.

393
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,712
We're going to win.

394
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,468
I could have got that far too.
- What?

395
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,313
I could have got that far too.

396
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,317
We're winning, aren't we?

397
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,590
We?
- Yes. Winning is winning.

398
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:49,676
See how much fun this is?
I prefer them younger though.

399
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,831
Hey, fuck head.

400
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,910
Ladies and gentlemen...

401
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,799
It's up and down.
They're still counting.

402
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,308
But they're telling me now...
Just checking. Can I say this?

403
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,916
The Dutch can say
they have a new president.

404
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,117
Their first president
is Joesoef Hasani.

405
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,678
Champion.

406
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,589
This was a preconceived plan.

407
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,911
You wanted to get rid of me
because I was sloppy and fat.

408
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,312
But it's only water retention.
Water retention. So what?

409
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,958
We won.
- Yes, OK.

410
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,032
Do you know where my car is?
Where's my car?

411
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,555
Ladies and gentlemen...

412
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,829
As your incumbent prime-minister
I give you our new...

413
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,393
president.

414
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,440
Mr. Joesoef Ha.

415
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,839
I, Joesoef Hasani...

416
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,152
will carry out the tasks of
the president of the Netherlands...

417
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,038
to the best of my abilities.

418
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,829
I will protect and defend
the constitutional law.

419
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,396
So help me Allah.
Praise and bless Him.

420
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,429
I, Hamid, will carry out my tasks
as his uncle to the best I can.

421
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,792
He's my cousin.

422
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,033
Mr. President, it's an honour
to be able to serve you.

423
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,709
There you are.
- It's against etiquette, sir.

424
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,636
Isn't this just great?

425
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,071
Are you allowed that
at home?

426
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,751
Don't ruin the furniture.

427
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:45,191
Stop it, guys.
- Get off.

428
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,397
I told you it wouldn't work.
- Sorry?

429
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:56,236
What a huge garden.
- There's room for a swimming pool.

430
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,551
We'll build a swimming pool.
No problem.

431
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,950
Swimming poodle?
- Swimmering.

432
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,150
We'll take this one, guys.

433
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,668
Have you got a driver's license?
- I can drive.

434
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,752
If I can ride a donkey,
I can drive a car.

435
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,553
Mummy? Hello.

436
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,598
My son. How are you?
- I'm very well.

437
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,116
My son.
President of the Netherlands.

438
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,840
Everyone's talking about you
over here.

439
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,794
Have you got plans for the country?
- Of course I have...

440
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,077
but I can't tell you by phone.
It's secret.

441
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,800
I bet it's like herding goats.
Remember?

442
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:58,159
If you want them to go to the right
or left, you just send them there.

443
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,437
And don't forget to give them water.

444
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,950
Yes, mum. If they need water,
I'll give it to them.

445
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,112
Listen, I have to go. I'm really busy.

446
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,111
Goodbye.
- Bye bye.

447
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,271
The president?
Yes, he's in a meeting.

448
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,194
What shall we do now?
- Do? Nothing.

449
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:32,397
Nothing? But he's the president.
He's the boss now.

450
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,680
Presidents don't govern, they make
compromises and amendments.

451
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,877
Stay away from it.
- It'll ruin your reputation.

452
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,388
You can use your incredible
talent to unite people and listen.

453
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,997
Exactly. So the two of us can
govern and support the country.

454
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,594
That's it.
- With them and for them.

455
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,591
OK, guys.
- Cheers.

456
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,957
KNOW YOURSELF

457
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,192
Dad?

458
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,392
Dead.

459
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:32,832
Ahoy president.
Come for a swim.

460
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,028
Who says 200 LCD-screens
are too many for the palace?

461
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,830
Which minister? Give me his
number. I need his permission?

462
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,954
Joesoef, where were you?
We've been looking for you.

463
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,759
I'm going to look for her.
I have her address.

464
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,390
Where? I don't see anything.
- Look, there.

465
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:01,034
What's wrong with you, friend?

466
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,310
You know she's no longer here.

467
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,311
I received a sign.

468
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:15,759
You stay and swim. Stay here.
I have to look for her. Now.

469
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,709
You're still in love with her,
aren't you?

470
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,713
You're the president now.
Do you realise that?

471
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,552
Take heart. Sit up.

472
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,992
You're Superman, Batman,
Spiderman, the Hulk.

473
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:34,718
You're Dirty Harry.

474
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:39,829
Of course your uncle will come with
you. If I don't, who will? Come on.

475
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,108
Come on, you guys.

476
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,717
I am Mila.

477
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,836
Joes, we've been everywhere.
Let's go.

478
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:24,876
After all, all women
are exactly the same.

479
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:30,036
It's all in the past. Let's go.

480
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,110
One more, OK?
Just one.

481
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,752
I thought I'd never see you again.
- I thought I'd never see you again.

482
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,152
Everyone told me you were dead.

483
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,075
I said no, I have her picture.
I looked at it every day.

484
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,869
But I'm here. I'm alive.

485
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,156
It's a miracle.

486
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,399
Who's that negro?
- Daddy.

487
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,189
Calm down. This is
the president of the Netherlands.

488
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,998
I don't care who he is.

489
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:09,234
Get those hearses off my ground.
And fast.

490
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,793
And go and dry the pots
for the preserved chicken livers.

491
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,350
What are you doing here?
- I've come to get you.

492
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,229
Holland was a failure for me.

493
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,393
So I went back home. OK?

494
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:23,871
Mila, come with me.

495
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,669
What can I do in Holland?
- You can do what you want.

496
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,354
I'm the president.

497
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,672
You think you can have
whatever you want now.

498
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,277
I'm not a sports car or
a flat-screen TV.

499
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,476
Flat-screen TV?

500
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,992
Just because I dance with a pole,
everyone thinks they own me...

501
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,628
and can fall in love with me
and have me.

502
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,631
In love?

503
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,518
Did I say that?

504
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:01,995
Mila, we can do something positive
for the country. You and me.

505
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,109
Mila, you're the fireworks in my
soul, the oasis in my water tank...

506
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,796
the drop of ice in my desert,
the stone in my cherry. I need you.

507
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,439
Honestly, Mila.
I want...

508
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,550
See that, Schwarzenegger?

509
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,438
And you're my...
little ray of sunshine.

510
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,594
Let go of the negro.
Get back to work.

511
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:51,514
The sugar beets and coal
need putting in the cellar.

512
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,595
And the wood and chicken livers.
- Stop it, Daddy.

513
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,311
Go ahead.

514
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,672
Gert Vlonder.

515
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,599
What brings you here?
- I need to talk to you.

516
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,230
It must be serious.
- We're no longer oppononts.

517
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:42,916
I need you. This desert prince
is done with cutting ribbons.

518
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:49,633
He wants to govern the country.
He will ruin it. You can be sure of it.

519
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,556
I'll go and get it for you.

520
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:01,508
What if he starts radicalizing?
- We'll all become Muslims.

521
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,318
Exactly.

522
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,552
I won't be allowed to drink wine.
- Nor gin.

523
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,917
I'll be walking around
in a black bag.

524
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,116
Precisely. No more short skirts.

525
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,432
So that's clear. I get rid of the boy
and I become the president.

526
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,468
And you can become first lady.

527
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:26,988
Excuse me? I become the
president and you... whatever.

528
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,832
What do you have in mind?
- Very simple. Bad publicity.

529
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,596
We focus on the woman.
Anything to make him look bad.

530
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,479
He looks bad enough as it is.

531
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,635
Very funny.

532
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,749
Good luck, sweet child.

533
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,434
I'll always think of you.

534
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,398
Kommolotien.
- Kommolotien.

535
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,997
Perhaps we should have invited
your father too.

536
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,278
He isn't my father.
He's my stepfather.

537
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,268
My parents were musicians.

538
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,630
They used to sing together
in political cafés.

539
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,150
Where are your parents now?

540
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:23,112
The old dictators
thought it necessary.

541
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,798
They sang songs
against dictatorship.

542
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,796
My father went away too.

543
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,709
He wanted to see the world.

544
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,118
I never thought about it.
- You live and learn.

545
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:57,272
I'm Aart Hausmacher. Pleased
to meet you. It's an honour.

546
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,551
Joes is one of a kind.

547
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,112
We're very likely.
- Alike.

548
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,792
Cheers.

549
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,152
Good.

550
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:31,279
If you've had enough of him,
feel free to call me.

551
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,192
Now, where were we?

552
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,989
Cousin, this is my new girlfriend.

553
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,115
That's what I said.

554
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,317
We'll get ourselves a drink.
See you later.

555
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,509
A is for Allah
that's what we call Joes

556
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,875
B is for Boyko
he likes pussy

557
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,474
C is for chicky
that's what Mila is

558
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,234
D is for dollar
without them it's hell

559
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,789
I is for immigrants
which we all are

560
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,475
J is for Joes
who has a small sausage

561
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,393
K is for Kravmil
who's always drunk

562
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,597
L is for love
which isn't for sale

563
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,435
Mr. President?

564
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:41,238
Mr. President.

565
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,272
The shit has hit the fan.

566
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:51,634
FIRST LADY
A POLE DANCER?

567
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,711
This isn't me. I was never naked.
It's an escort girl.

568
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,273
Whatever we do,
they'll try to make us look bad.

569
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,876
They'll fling mud at us
at any chance they get.

570
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,998
We have to put a stop
to this slander.

571
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,073
What about a charm offensive?

572
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,354
Since the president's future wife
was accused...

573
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,351
of working as a pole dancer...

574
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,830
the couple has started
a promotional campaign.

575
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:58,355
Is this the editor?
I have a great story for you.

576
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,196
I have a story for you.

577
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,032
Hold on.

578
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,956
Turn it off.

579
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,955
I'm on the phone.

580
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:23,553
The treasurer,
Mrs. Van Tongeren-Rostinga.

581
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:30,671
With her watchful eye over
the arts and crafts and diligence.

582
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:35,471
Mr. Van Gunteren-lttersum...

583
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,709
Put me through?
This is Immigrations? Why?

584
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,998
I want the financial department.
Oh, my Dutch is no good?

585
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,589
Water? Yes, I'm standing
near water.

586
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:05,479
What do you mean, go back to
my camels? Do you realise...

587
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:09,519
Next I want us to cut down
on public transport...

588
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:12,672
social security and welfare.

589
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,355
No money into culture
and film. It's all rubbish anyway.

590
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:20,433
Some extra wage cuts and that's it.
- I'm sorry, Gert.

591
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:24,832
All these things are the opposite
of what the president wants.

592
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,959
We have to rule the country.
- According to his principles.

593
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,350
That's what you say.
- Don't you?

594
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,594
I don't think it's sunk in. I'm the one
who determines the policy.

595
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,910
The unrest is increasing.

596
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,959
Trade unions say the president
isn't sticking to his promises.

597
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:48,319
Certainly after the huge wage cuts
and decrease in health care.

598
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,678
Joes, I'm going nuts.

599
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,631
What?
- Why am I here?

600
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:06,596
What do you mean?
- I'm not needed here.

601
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:12,073
I'm just supposed to look like
a doll and hang around. That's all.

602
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,470
No, Mila.
Of course you're needed.

603
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,949
You're a beautiful doll
but you're really needed.

604
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:22,908
What do you think, little man?

605
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,230
Joes, this is no good.

606
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,958
Look at them.

607
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,318
And over there.

608
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,679
You do nothing.

609
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,669
Sometimes you need to relax.
- Relax? That's all you do.

610
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:49,549
You smile, here, there, sit...
That's all.

611
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,919
You're a puppet.
- Don't talk to me like that.

612
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,193
You don't do much either.
- Is it my fault?

613
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,989
You're an ass.

614
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:11,273
What?

615
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,870
Joes, you're the president.

616
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,315
What are you doing
for the country?

617
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:26,359
We were going to change things.

618
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,150
We're not doing anything at all.

619
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:38,435
People need you for
a better country, for changes...

620
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,036
To change the bad people.

621
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,237
The bad people.

622
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:02,835
The president speaking.

623
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,598
This is no good.

624
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,910
A woman is like iron, metal.

625
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,038
Start welding while she's still hot.

626
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,992
Don't you understand that women
say things on the spur of the moment?

627
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:44,948
A woman is like the currents
in the ocean.

628
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:48,476
Sometimes she goes this way,
sometimes that way.

629
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:52,952
If you really want her to believe
in you, show her who you are...

630
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,475
and what you can do.

631
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:01,398
Bad news.

632
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,308
'Dissatisfaction about President.'
'President denies policy.'

633
01:05:09,360 --> 01:05:11,635
How's this possible?
- Vlonder.

634
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,439
He's betrayed us.
- Vlonder.

635
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,112
They're calling us liars.

636
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,919
We need
a press conference.

637
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:29,032
We have to try and undo
everything, if it's still possible.

638
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:33,033
Now.

639
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,113
One at a time, please.

640
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,956
Stick to your promises.
- Public transport is lousy.

641
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,590
There's no care for the elderly.
- One at a time.

642
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,716
Me.
- Mrs. Petit first.

643
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:55,273
People are opposed to
the diminished care of the elderly.

644
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,954
What do you hope to achieve by this?

645
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:04,034
If that's the case my co-workers
acted without my knowledge. I'm sorry.

646
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:08,637
In that case everyone will be
curious to know what's next.

647
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,438
I understand.

648
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,239
When we herd goats
in the desert...

649
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,359
and we send them to the left,
they tend to go to the right.

650
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:22,469
So it's the same. If goats go
the wrong way, don't let them go.

651
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:24,870
That's what I'll do:
Not let go.

652
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,233
Economy recovers,
thanks to president Hasani

653
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:01,437
That rotten Moroccan.
You blew it.

654
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,670
Your ideas aren't great either.

655
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:06,638
Yes, they are.
- Such as?

656
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,310
Mila, please call me back.

657
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,789
I'm sorry. I know I've been stupid.

658
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,513
I made a mental note.

659
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,836
Please call me.

660
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:34,916
Take good care of Mila.

661
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,948
Joes, I want to show you something.

662
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,031
We must find a TV.

663
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:45,115
No problem.
He was my friend too.

664
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:51,628
It appears Joesoef Ha
is carrying a false passport...

665
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,631
so he can't reside in our country.

666
01:09:53,800 --> 01:10:00,831
As I'm the vice-president I will take over
for the sake of the country...

667
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,117
and lead the country
into calmer waters.

668
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,990
The bastard.
- The assault?

669
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:12,152
Was it the fat guy
who tried to kill us?

670
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,078
A blonde girl.

671
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,720
Show us, show us.

672
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:43,198
We have no passports, no papers.

673
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:47,353
We can't go back.
- I know, but I promised them.

674
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:53,277
If that loser Vlonders becomes
president, they need my help.

675
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,916
We're going back to the palace
and stand up for our rights.

676
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:06,958
You're mad.
- I'm the president.

677
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,271
The people are behind us.
You drive.

678
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,191
There are guards.

679
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:47,277
Rest in peace.

680
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:16,349
What's this?
Have you gone crazy?

681
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:20,957
We want our passports back.
And my presidency.

682
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,236
This is madness.

683
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,873
Let's go outside.
To the swimming pool.

684
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:02,873
I've a fear of hights.
- Fear of what?

685
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:05,429
I'm not going through that window.

686
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,232
The water's lovely.
Jump, jump.

687
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,512
Together?

688
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,792
Jump, OK?
- Shall I?

689
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:36,428
One, two...

690
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,955
Wait. You have to jump.

691
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:07,832
You and your idiotic plans.
- What? You started it.

692
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,755
If you'd looked after the goats properly,
all this wouldn't have happened.

693
01:14:12,920 --> 01:14:14,911
Stop it.
- You shut up.

694
01:14:15,080 --> 01:14:17,992
Don't talk to her like that.
- I'll talk when I want to.

695
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:21,038
You asshole.
- You bastard.

696
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:24,476
Why is everyone being so nasty?

697
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:29,634
Yes, what's the use?
You're no good anyway.

698
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:35,079
What's he doing here?
- He's a chostage.

699
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:39,074
You mean a hostage.
- Yes, a hostage.

700
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,828
The president's frenzied departure
has caused a crisis in the country.

701
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:51,028
Former prime-minister Mrs. Heesters
will take over automatically.

702
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:56,877
Although slightly premature, she will
address the people in a live broadcast.

703
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,555
She can now call herself
Interim President.

704
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,633
What has the bitch done now?
I'm not having it.

705
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,917
I bet you knew all about this, Aart.
Come here, you...

706
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,510
Calm down.
- Disgusting. I think it's disgusting.

707
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:18,314
We must hurry.
She's going to address the people soon.

708
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,436
Hilversum.
- OK, President.

709
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,831
You're such a spineless goon.

710
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:44,792
Put the tape back on
and put him back.

711
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,430
He's heavy.
He's like an elephant.

712
01:15:58,240 --> 01:15:59,719
It's impossible, guys.

713
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,072
Of course it's possible.
I'm still the president.

714
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,751
Where are we going?

715
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:32,515
Where's the studio?
- How should I know?

716
01:16:36,360 --> 01:16:39,591
I have to go.
I have to pee. I just have to pee.

717
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,308
Fellow-countrymen,
I want to say something to you.

718
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,837
I understand everyone's confused
after all that's happened.

719
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:40,279
But I've really tried to listen to you.
Honestly.

720
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,432
I am your president.
I should not have to resign.

721
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,991
They say I'm not in the country.
But I'm here, aren't I?

722
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,628
I'm here. I'm here for you.

723
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,075
Stop filming.

724
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:58,268
Get rid of the press. Evacuate
the studio and remove this man.

725
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:03,719
This man is illegal.

726
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:08,914
There's no way he can make use of his
function as he's trying right now.

727
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,958
Is this legitimate what you're doing?

728
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:15,476
That's why I've decided that we...

729
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,911
Joesoef... Joesoef...

730
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:04,557
Behind the horizon
there's a different world.

731
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,870
There are many colours.

732
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,309
We only have one life, Joes.

733
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,917
You must grab it.
Understand?

734
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,833
That's why I must go.

735
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:25,318
Don't do what others tell you, Joes...

736
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,153
but follow your heart.

737
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:39,518
Follow your heart.

738
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,916
Grab them.

739
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,358
Dear people, our president
doesn't have legitimate documents.

740
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:57,117
I can't help it but you still need
a Dutch passport in the Netherlands.

741
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,670
Don't make a fuss.
I don't want to be president anymore.

742
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,035
What?
- What did you say?

743
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,718
I will resign,
but under a few conditions.

744
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,030
So we're doing all this for nothing?

745
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,591
What are they?

746
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:26,875
We have to have new elections
for a new parliament.

747
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:31,079
I hope someone will win
who deserves to...

748
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:37,918
and that my friend Aart Hausmacher
may be a worthy Prime Minister.

749
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,712
I've met someone I love.

750
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,439
She went away.

751
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,717
I let her go. I wasn't paying attention.

752
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,311
I thought I could win her back
by being a good president.

753
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,516
I wanted her to be proud of me.

754
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,275
But the more I tried,
the more power I was losing.

755
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,512
And you need that power.

756
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,468
Because without it,
without love, you're nothing.

757
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:21,428
That's why I'm quitting. I'm going to do
what I should have done ages ago.

758
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,068
Which is spending time with her.

759
01:21:25,440 --> 01:21:27,158
I'm choosing her.

760
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,715
Stop whimpering
and go to your girlfriend.

761
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:45,071
May I say something?

762
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,435
Someone once told me:

763
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:52,549
Never ask people what they want.
They all want something different.

764
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:57,157
For instance: What do you want?
- A baby.

765
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,039
What do you want?

766
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,716
I want to make documentaries
about Africa.

767
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:07,798
What do you want?

768
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,071
Big?

769
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,354
See?
Everyone has different wishes.

770
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:19,239
You can be a Muslim
who likes croquettes.

771
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,676
You can be a Catholic
and marry a Hindu.

772
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:28,198
You're all so polite to one another here.
But you're spoilt too.

773
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,874
In our village in Morocco
we had bikes too.

774
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,068
But if they broke down we didn't go
and buy a new one in the next village.

775
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:39,118
Or go to the cycle mender.
We did it ourselves.

776
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:43,990
We went to our neighbours.
Even if it was early in the morning.

777
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:49,473
What about breakfast, they'd say.
While some started to mend the bike...

778
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,392
others made breakfast.

779
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,869
You have to keep communicating.

780
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:57,316
My village is like a family.
All countries should be.

781
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,710
Your family never lets you down.

782
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:03,156
For instance: Do you have a neighbour
from Kazakhstan?

783
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:06,437
Why not go and see him right now?

784
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,114
All you people at home,
open your windows.

785
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:15,230
Whether they open horizontally
or vertically, open your windows...

786
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:18,597
and start shouting
through your open windows:

787
01:23:18,760 --> 01:23:20,955
Hello, neighbours.

788
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:24,112
Just do it. Say:
Hello, neighbours. How are you?

789
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,840
And wave as well.
Just do it.

790
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,877
Hello, neighbours.

791
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,077
Hello, neighbours.

792
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,356
See, it's working.

793
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:38,513
Everybody who's watching me,
go to your windows and call out:

794
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,195
Hello, neighbours.

795
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:45,636
All of you, shout it out.
Hello, neighbours.

796
01:23:56,160 --> 01:23:59,118
Now, all of you at once.

797
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,310
That's how the president
was no longer a president.

798
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,198
The country was OK again.

799
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:31,956
They had new elections, not for
a president but for several parties.

800
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:35,157
They had endless discussions again.

801
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,073
They had their parliamentary democracy
back.

802
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,751
Joes started his journey.
And that's about it.

803
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,913
People are always on the move.
Emigrating, immigrating.

804
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,433
It would be a shame to let
such a beautiful world pass by.
