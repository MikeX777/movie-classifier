2
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,660
I think
I made a mistake.

3
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:36,827
Why do you
have to finish it?

4
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:38,245
You answer me please.

5
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:39,997
Just answer me.

6
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:40,832
Why do you have to finish it?

7
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:43,335
You can't come to your...

8
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:44,210
To your...

9
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:47,756
Jess, I
love you most, okay?

10
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,724
Please, someone.

11
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:26,186
Anyone, if you know anything
about her disappearance.

12
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:16,236
What's up, minions?

13
00:03:16,278 --> 00:03:18,740
DropTheMike here at the
Pasadena suicide bridge.

14
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:20,450
How awesome is this?

15
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,377
In 1913, the bridge
was built and since then,

16
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,673
100 people have leapt
to their deaths,

17
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:36,841
the most famous of
which is Myrtle Ward.

18
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:39,552
Myrtle Ward is famous for
having tossed her infant

19
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:43,347
off this bridge and
jumping shortly thereafter

20
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:46,350
so that they could spend the
afterlife together forever.

21
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:47,310
Isn't that sweet?

22
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,896
In a remarkable twist
of fate, thick branches

23
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:52,022
slowed the infant's
fall to the ground

24
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,733
and it landed mostly unharmed.

25
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,528
Myrtle wasn't so lucky
though and people say

26
00:03:56,568 --> 00:03:58,947
that you can still hear
her ghost wandering

27
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:00,448
beneath the bridge at night,

28
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,826
searching for her newborn child.

29
00:04:04,326 --> 00:04:05,286
All right, guys.

30
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,579
That's it for this installation.

31
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,248
I am DropTheMike,

32
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:10,500
subscribe to my channel.

33
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:14,753
I post sick and twisted
new videos every other...

34
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,595
What's up, minions?

35
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,055
It's DropTheMike here.

36
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:26,390
Some of you sick bastards
have been asking me

37
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,058
for special behind
the scenes extras.

38
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,353
Well follow me this way,

39
00:04:30,394 --> 00:04:31,937
if you dare.

40
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,480
This is my little baby.

41
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,941
Little J Dahmer.

42
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,278
Hey, hey, do your impersonation
of a strangulation victim.

43
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:41,488
Mwah.

44
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:45,576
And right over here is my always
effervescent fiance, Jess.

45
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,579
Say hi to the multitudes, baby.

46
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,789
All right as you can see,
Jess is an incredibly talented

47
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:51,915
artist right over here.

48
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,878
She's also a nurse on the
west side of Los Angeles.

49
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:57,046
A truly noble career path
if I do say so myself,

50
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,131
unlike yours truly.

51
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:02,052
Hey, so my followers have
a few questions for you.

52
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,093
Wanna answer them?

53
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:03,927
Yes, you do.

54
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,763
Yes, you do.

55
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:05,596
Oh, come on, come on,

56
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:07,097
don't do this to me.

57
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:09,308
Loosecanon99 wants to know

58
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,020
do you approve of
what Mike does?

59
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,481
Ugh,

60
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,775
no.

61
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,942
I haven't seen one of
his films in a while.

62
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,072
They're just unsettling
for my taste, you know?

63
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:26,492
But he loves what he does and
it keeps him off drugs, so.

64
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:27,326
So she thinks.

65
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,161
Okay, get out of here.

66
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:28,994
I got work to do.

67
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:30,454
Ow!

68
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,538
Ladies and gentlemen and
everything in between,

69
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:32,956
this is my inner sanctum.

70
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,377
This is where my wicked
brew is concocted

71
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,795
and the witch stirring
the visual pot

72
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:40,339
is none other than my editor
and occasional cohort,

73
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:41,507
the amazing Nic.

74
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,387
Say hi to the minions, Nic.

75
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:48,013
She loves me.

76
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,974
After each shoot, the DP and
I unload all of our video

77
00:05:51,016 --> 00:05:53,478
and sound cards to her
and she has carte blanche

78
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,478
to edit them as she sees fit.

79
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,855
And of course, last but
not deceased,

80
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,401
is my DP, which is
Director of Photography

81
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,694
for your idiots out there,
and very best friend.

82
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:03,153
The one and only Christopher.

83
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,781
Hey, Chris, turn the
camera around and show them

84
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,490
your ugly mug, okay?

85
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:09,827
Gotcha, didn't I?

86
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
No, this is not Christopher.

87
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,831
This is Fred the Head.

88
00:06:13,872 --> 00:06:15,082
He's great, isn't he?

89
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:15,959
Okay, Chris, we
can show you now.

90
00:06:16,999 --> 00:12:33,874
We can introduce you.

91
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,420
Okay give me the camera, good.

92
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,670
Separated at birth?

93
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,672
I think so.

94
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,839
You're such a dick.

95
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:23,632
Stop!

96
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,634
Talk about good head,

97
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,509
right, friend?

98
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:26,343
Stop, Nic!

99
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,429
God, will you guys
get out of here?

100
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,430
Oh, Jesus Christ.

101
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm gonna cut...

102
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,896
What's up, minions?

103
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,191
Okay, really, all
joking aside, I just had

104
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,485
an incredible phone call
with the super popular

105
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:43,610
clothing store, Haute Gothic.

106
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,865
They just told me that if I
can get 50,000 subscribers

107
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,199
by the end of Halloween weekend,
they're gonna sponsor me

108
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:51,076
a whopping $250,000.

109
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,831
That is 250 grand, people!

110
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,040
It's incredible.

111
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,459
Okay, so this is
where you come in.

112
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,502
I need you to comment
below and tell me

113
00:06:59,543 --> 00:07:01,503
what horrifying locations
you think I should do

114
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:04,007
a super scary Halloween
edition vlog, okay?

115
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,632
It's gonna be sick.

116
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:10,555
If you don't do it, Fred
the Head will be so sad.

117
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,431
Love you guys and
I'll see you later.

118
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,058
DropTheMike out.

119
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,609
What's up, minions?

120
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,069
Bet you're wondering
what I'm doing

121
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,488
in this seemingly peaceful
middle class street.

122
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:28,655
Sweet costume, dude.

123
00:07:28,697 --> 00:07:30,532
Uh, excuse me,
I'm Michael Myers.

124
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,495
I may look like a troll
doll, but I'm Michael Myers.

125
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,913
Many people don't know
this, but real life

126
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:38,165
serial killer David
Olmos dumped one

127
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:41,252
of this many victims' dead
bodies in this street.

128
00:07:41,293 --> 00:07:43,837
It was in this exact spot
that the neighbors found

129
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,257
her dismembered body in a
trash can the next morning.

130
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,593
Oh my God, Chris.

131
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,760
Chris.

132
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,178
She's still here.

133
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,971
Oh, it was too soon.

134
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,598
She was so innocent, it's so...

135
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,518
oh, that feels real good.

136
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,603
Oh, this wig is real itchy.

137
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,730
Anyways, two weeks ago, I
asked you guys to tell me

138
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,608
where you thought
that I should shoot

139
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,735
my Halloween vlog coming up,
sponsored by Haute Gothic.

140
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,237
Shhh.

141
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:10,197
The response was overwhelming
I couldn't believe

142
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,576
how much you guys wanted to
see me at the winning location,

143
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,954
which is the Lenox Hotel.

144
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,790
Per your requests, I'm gonna
be spending the entirety

145
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,541
of Halloween weekend
there with my crew.

146
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,128
The hotel happens to be where
Night Crawler, David Olmos,

147
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:25,963
lived and is also where
a tourist, Meghan Kim,

148
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,757
famous for her elevator
video recently met

149
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,259
her untimely demise.

150
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,136
We're shooting the
entirety of the vlog there.

151
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,221
And we have an expert
here to tell us more

152
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:36,015
about this petrifying place.

153
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,975
That person is.

154
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:42,105
My friend and haunted hotel
historian, Wallace Fleischer,

155
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,525
author of the book "The
Many Curses of Hotel Lenox."

156
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,652
Please join me in
welcoming the one and only,

157
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,863
the singular sensation,
Wallace Fleischer.

158
00:08:50,904 --> 00:08:52,031
Good evening, sire.

159
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:53,198
Thank you very much.

160
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,534
I'm not gonna kiss your hand,
you're not wearing a ring.

161
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,327
But Wallace, thank you
very much for having us

162
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,038
into your home today,
we appreciate it.

163
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,331
You're more than
welcome, Mike.

164
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,542
Hi, Chris.

165
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,500
Hi, Wallace.

166
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,671
So why did you write
about Hotel Lenox?

167
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,798
I began to understand
why it was so frightening

168
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,677
after I learned more
about its sordid history.

169
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,307
The Hotel Lenox is
downtown LA near where

170
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:18,767
Skid Row area is.

171
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,851
They changed the name
of the hotel many times

172
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:24,188
over the years because of
its very bad reputation,

173
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,858
especially what happened
a few months ago

174
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,860
with the hotel, which
I'll go into in a moment.

175
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,863
It was built in 1927,

176
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,072
there were 123

177
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,870
people who were either
murdered or killed themselves

178
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,080
in this hotel.

179
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,126
Now, the infamous David Olmos.

180
00:09:45,168 --> 00:09:46,378
Ah, yes.

181
00:09:46,418 --> 00:09:47,879
- The Night Crawler.
- The Night Crawler.

182
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,633
He stayed on the
14th floor in 1985.

183
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,093
Managed to murder 14 people.

184
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:58,306
He lured people into his
room, mostly prostitutes,

185
00:09:59,014 --> 00:10:01,393
which then he would dismember.

186
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:04,395
But not before he had completely
stripped their bodies,

187
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:08,774
tortured them, and had sex
with their dead bodies.

188
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,903
The neighbors, they'd heard
this humming sound at night

189
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,699
of the electric hacksaw
but they didn't know

190
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,243
what it was for so no
one ever said anything.

191
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:19,119
Wow!

192
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,870
A devil worshiper.

193
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:22,831
How cliche.

194
00:10:24,289 --> 00:10:29,169
Yes, that's a
satanic symbol of Babylon.

195
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,338
Follow Satan, you will.

196
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,049
So all joking aside,

197
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,427
could you tell us what happened

198
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,138
to David Olmos?

199
00:10:38,178 --> 00:10:40,973
Well, he cut his
throat in jail.

200
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:44,686
Wow, I think this sets
the stage beautifully.

201
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,937
I wanna thank Wallace
Fleischer for enlightening us

202
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,188
on the hotel's history.

203
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,316
Thank you very much
for your time, Wallace.

204
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:53,360
And be sure to keep
track of us as we gear up

205
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,113
for our three nights
at the Hotel Lenox,

206
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,113
we'll be posting

207
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,072
- our vlogs beforehand...
- Wait.

208
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,451
You're not staying there?

209
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,452
You're not
gonna listen to a thing

210
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,870
Wallace has to say, are you?

211
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,123
About not staying
at the hotel?

212
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,081
Are you kidding me?

213
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,793
Dude, it's ooga booga nonsense.

214
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:10,795
You know, there's no
such thing as spirits,

215
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,129
and ghosts, and blah blah blah.

216
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,673
You do a
vlog about spirits,

217
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,924
and ghosts, and blah blah blah.

218
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,468
Yeah, I also
watch horror movies.

219
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:18,970
That doesn't mean that
I believe in everything

220
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,055
that I see in them.

221
00:11:21,096 --> 00:11:23,140
I don't know, man.

222
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,059
I don't think we
should do this one.

223
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,144
Seriously?

224
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:27,312
Are you kidding me?

225
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,980
Give me the camera.

226
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:29,855
God.

227
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:32,817
What a pussy.

228
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,069
Look at yourself.

229
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,071
I mean, we have been to
so many different places

230
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,447
where terrible
things have happened.

231
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,824
Are you seriously
gonna ditch the vlog

232
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,908
over one hotel?

233
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,243
This is different.

234
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,161
How?

235
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,707
The other places we shot
outside, we never went in them.

236
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,125
What?

237
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,044
Inside, outside, what
difference does that even make?

238
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,129
I'm look, sorry.

239
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:53,963
I'm sorry, okay?

240
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,215
No, this is great.

241
00:11:55,255 --> 00:11:57,257
This is exactly why
I keep you around

242
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,511
for this Catholic-y,
pope-y nonsense

243
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:02,514
that you were raised on.

244
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:03,931
It's a nice, new perspective.

245
00:12:03,972 --> 00:12:06,392
But seriously, okay,
you were brainwashed

246
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:09,062
by some pastor, or
priest, or whatever

247
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,022
who had dressed up in their
nice, little robe costume,

248
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,065
preaching these ideas
to you so that they...

249
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,733
It's not made up!

250
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,236
I've seen ghosts.

251
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,740
I've seen evil spirits.

252
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,081
Seriously, chill out, I...

253
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,499
I wanna know, okay?

254
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,292
Just talk to me, man.

255
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,879
I was 10 years old.

256
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:42,220
I looked in the bathroom
and there's this

257
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,763
kid standing in the doorway.

258
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:45,807
His right hand,

259
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,852
he's holding this tabby cat

260
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,938
from a noose.

261
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,571
He drops this cat and
it starts running at me

262
00:12:59,611 --> 00:13:00,904
and it's like, scratching

263
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,865
and clawing at my face.

264
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,119
I was blinded but I,

265
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,331
I finally reached
the light switch

266
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:15,253
and by the time I turned
it on, they were both gone.

267
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,048
I called my mom the next
day and I told her to come

268
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:21,009
pick me up and get
me out of there.

269
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,806
Wow, dude, that's terrible.

270
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:31,560
That's the most terrible
fucking story I've ever heard

271
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,978
in my entire life.

272
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,813
I mean, a fucking
tabby cat in a noose

273
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,025
ran at you and attacked
you in the face?

274
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,985
Are you kidding me?

275
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,110
I mean, come on.

276
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,363
Think about this, okay?

277
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,990
It is always when people
are falling asleep,

278
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,076
halfway between
awake and sleeping,

279
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,535
they are ramping into
REM cycle and their mind

280
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:49,953
plays tricks on them...

281
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:50,913
What about the
scratches on my face?

282
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:51,956
Dude, your own fingernails.

283
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,458
Come on, Einstein.

284
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,958
You know, it's nice to
know that the only two people

285
00:13:55,999 --> 00:13:56,627
I've ever told this
to, you and my mother,

286
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,879
don't believe me.

287
00:13:58,922 --> 00:13:59,964
Dude, seriously.

288
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,800
That cat and
that kid were real.

289
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,634
Yeah, okay.

290
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,635
Sure, whatever.

291
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,932
I'm not doing Hotel
Lenox, man, there's no way.

292
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,184
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not!

293
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,184
Yes,

294
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,645
you are, all right?

295
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,064
Tune in next week to find
out if pussy Christopher here

296
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,149
grew a pair of testicles.

297
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:19,984
Shut up, Michael!

298
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:25,322
Okay, guys.

299
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:27,866
So pussy Christopher threw a
wrench in the works last night.

300
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,662
Now, I could hire a new DP
for Halloween weekend but

301
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,038
he and I know each others'
work rhythms and we've been

302
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,499
working together
since high school.

303
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,375
So...

304
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,294
so, I'm gonna try
a different tactic.

305
00:14:40,672 --> 00:14:42,007
Danni, that you?

306
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:43,883
Mike?

307
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,509
The one and only.

308
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,469
What the hell
are you doing here?

309
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,012
Do you got a second?

310
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,514
Oh gentle, gentle, Jesus.

311
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,349
Oh God, that thing
does not work well, does it?

312
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,516
Yeah.

313
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,101
Okay, I gotcha,
I gotcha, I gotcha.

314
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:55,352
Wow, looking good.

315
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,478
So what are you
doing down there?

316
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,397
You know the sound makes
when you drive a car, that

317
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:00,482
Uh, sure.

318
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,942
I was recording it
for a friend's short.

319
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,028
- Okay, I see, yeah.
- Don't ask.

320
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,030
Hey, look, I need
you Halloween weekend.

321
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:06,947
Can you turn that off?

322
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:07,865
No, I'm a vlogger.

323
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,492
Look, I just need you
to do third camera,

324
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,119
some backup sound.

325
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,037
Okay, what's the hitch?

326
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:13,912
What are
you talking about?

327
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,165
There's always a
hitch with you, Mike.

328
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,959
Okay, it's in a hotel
that the unenlightened claims

329
00:15:18,999 --> 00:15:19,001
is mildly haunted.

330
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,336
And?

331
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,629
And I need
you to get Christopher

332
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:22,629
to do the shoot with us.

333
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:23,630
Oh.

334
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,466
Yeah, no, that's...

335
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:25,299
Look, look.

336
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,216
Christopher likes you.

337
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,969
Okay, he more than likes you.

338
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,553
Thank you for that.

339
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,722
So you wanna capitalize on our
friendship and his feelings.

340
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,639
That's just great.

341
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,060
Just three
days and three nights.

342
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,687
Okay, I'll give
you scale plus 200.

343
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,439
That means 200 a day.

344
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,648
Okay, send me the details.

345
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,566
Yes!

346
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,399
And a contract.

347
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:43,234
Of course, always.

348
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,485
Only the best for you.

349
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,653
That's why you're my favorite.

350
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:10,762
So I just got off the phone
with the Hotel Lenox's manager.

351
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,264
She said we absolutely
cannot shoot there

352
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,557
under any conditions.

353
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,434
The hotel's gotten
a lot of bad press

354
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,186
since the Meghan
Kim elevator video

355
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,270
and Meghan Kim's family
is now suing them.

356
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:23,316
So I don't know, I guess
I just gotta give up.

357
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,109
Just kidding, fuck it.

358
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,194
As you can see, we've decided
to shoot at the hotel anyways.

359
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,115
So we're packing all of
our gear into suitcases

360
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,115
to disguise ourselves
as tourists.

361
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,783
We're also gonna be wearing
hats and other things

362
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,661
so that people
can't recognize us.

363
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,371
And what's special
about this vlog is,

364
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,790
we're gonna have Nic
on set editing live.

365
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,418
How you feeling about that, Nic?

366
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,627
Oh you know,
absolute thrilled.

367
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,628
Yes, you are.

368
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:46,506
She's going to be
posting videos throughout

369
00:16:46,548 --> 00:16:47,673
Halloween night so
you've gotta make sure

370
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,010
that you see them before the
hotel yanks 'em, all right?

371
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,348
And we are so excited
to have Danni on board.

372
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,807
Yay!

373
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,850
Hey, Danni, do you really
think that there are

374
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:00,270
evil spirits waiting in
the hotel, ready to pounce?

375
00:17:00,311 --> 00:17:01,604
Pretty sure the only
thing waiting to pounce

376
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,563
is bed bugs, Mike.

377
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,480
That's disgusting.

378
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:06,026
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and

379
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,652
we're welcoming
back into the fold

380
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,111
the one and only Christ-opher.

381
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,030
The only reason I'm
doing this is because

382
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,073
I'm $500 shy on rent.

383
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,701
Yeah, uh-huh, sure.

384
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,662
So Chris, why don't
you tell our sycophants

385
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,831
about some of the amazing gear
that you've brought with us?

386
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,709
We've got a couple
of security cams here,

387
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,337
spy cam, set up with
a button, and hat cam.

388
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,338
Oh, that's sick.

389
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,590
Where's the lens?

390
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:31,176
The lens is the left
eye of the smiley face.

391
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,178
Oh, that's sick.

392
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,471
If that's not cool enough,
we got a drone packed up

393
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,305
and ready to go.

394
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,222
Oh, no way.

395
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:38,725
That's so millennial of us.

396
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,727
Hey, Chris, can I borrow
that for my next sex tape?

397
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:42,519
I heard that.

398
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,271
Everybody, will you
please just be careful?

399
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,484
I don't want any of you ending
up in the ER, all right?

400
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,692
Kiss her!

401
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,693
Shush!

402
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,987
All right, come on.

403
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:51,820
Oh hey, hey, one
more for camera.

404
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:52,864
One more for camera.

405
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,822
Come on, come on.

406
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,075
There it is.

407
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:55,950
Get.

408
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,163
That was a little taste
for those of you out there

409
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,539
who can't get any action,
which is most of you.

410
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,502
Anyways, we're headed
to downtown Los Angeles.

411
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,377
Ooh.

412
00:18:07,045 --> 00:18:09,464
This is your co-pilot, Michael.

413
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,717
We are now entering the first
layer of Dante's Inferno,

414
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,553
please make sure that your
seats are in their full upright

415
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,639
and missionary position.

416
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:18,890
Hey,

417
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:22,727
grab my phone charger
out of there, will you?

418
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:23,560
What the...

419
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,562
Yes!

420
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,397
Motherfu...

421
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,565
I spring loaded it.

422
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,608
Yeah,
tricked the trickster.

423
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:30,735
Well played, Slim Shady.

424
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,278
But just so you know,

425
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,572
payback's a bitch.

426
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:57,262
The nice part of downtown's
just two blocks away.

427
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:59,264
It's feast or famine down here.

428
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,267
Check this guy out.

429
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,144
Nic, give him $50 and
maybe he'll do a backflip.

430
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,519
Jesus!

431
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,271
Ow.

432
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,691
Does anybody know
why they put those gargoyles

433
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:11,275
on the side of
buildings like that?

434
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,153
It's to ward off evil.

435
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:16,447
Actually, they are there
to prevent the rainwater

436
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,950
from falling down
the masonary walls.

437
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,326
Wow, Nic.

438
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,538
Throwing out
knowledge sans Google.

439
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,624
I'm telling you,
it's to ward off evil.

440
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,336
I think I'm gonna go with
Nic on this one, buddy.

441
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,461
Sorry.

442
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,587
There she is.

443
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,299
Can you feel the
love, Christopher?

444
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,634
No, it
looks creepy already.

445
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:40,471
I don't see
any gargoyles up there.

446
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,932
Hmm, not cool.

447
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,309
Hey, do you
guys see that boy there?

448
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:50,939
Oh!
What the...

449
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,649
Okay.

450
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:53,859
Hey, dude.

451
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,028
I don't need my
windshield cleaned.

452
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:55,861
It's fine.

453
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,279
You have change?

454
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,364
I don't have
any change on me.

455
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,365
We don't have any money
in here, I'm sorry, dude.

456
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,616
A dollar's fine.

457
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,742
Dude, you
need to just leave.

458
00:20:01,785 --> 00:20:02,826
I don't have
anything, I'm sorry.

459
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,660
You don't have to be
an asshole about it.

460
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:04,495
Whoa.

461
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,372
You're the asshole, dude.

462
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,373
I hope you die!

463
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,586
Did that homeless dude
just tell me to die?

464
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,003
Alrighty, my minions.

465
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,840
From here on out,
we are rolling 24/7.

466
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,509
We take a dump, it
better be on camera.

467
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,510
Great.

468
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:20,969
My ass can end up as a meme.

469
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,388
Whoa!

470
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,348
What's up, dude?

471
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,267
Weird deja vu moment.

472
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,685
Glitch in the matrix?

473
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,561
Yeah.

474
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,875
All right, the same elevator
Meghan Kim was last seen in

475
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,752
before she disappeared.

476
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:54,754
Creepsville.

477
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:55,922
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

478
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,923
These are the buttons
she pushed, too.

479
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:00,592
Hey, why are we
going up to 14?

480
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,760
You'll see.

481
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,307
Here we are.

482
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,893
It's not as
horrible as I thought.

483
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,936
Only the finest for
my fine, fine crew.

484
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,355
Oh, please.

485
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,398
The receptionist
said some of the floors

486
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:15,442
are nicer than others.

487
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,442
The rest of them...

488
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:18,068
Rat-infested hell holes.

489
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,403
Yeah, pretty much.

490
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:20,237
For like low income locals

491
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,031
and backpackers
and such, anyways.

492
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:23,783
All right, so Nic.

493
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,785
You are in room 1426.

494
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,414
Guys,

495
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,750
give her peace.

496
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,958
She needs to edit.

497
00:21:33,999 --> 00:21:34,418
Break legs, guys.

498
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:35,295
Literally.

499
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,922
And us.

500
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,049
Guys, we're in room 1428.

501
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,596
Why is he so
excited about this?

502
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,388
This does not
bode well for us.

503
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:48,350
Well I told you guys
I had a surprise, right?

504
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,726
This is your present.

505
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,394
This is the room where,

506
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,315
where David Olmos lived when
he murdered those 14 people.

507
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,316
You're kidding?

508
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,274
Really?

509
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,442
Dude, there's no way
I'm staying in there.

510
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,693
Yes, you are.

511
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:02,072
No, I'm not staying in
David's death dungeon.

512
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:03,615
Dude, that was
like, 30 years ago.

513
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,450
Stop being such a pussy.

514
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:06,909
I resent that pussy comment.

515
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,411
Why is it guys always
say that when someone's

516
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,620
not being brave enough?

517
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:10,997
It's not a
question of being brave.

518
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,414
Yes, it is.

519
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,417
As in, they're
female-like, meaning

520
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:15,710
they're less than
they should be.

521
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,086
It's not a question
of bravery here,

522
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,129
it's a question of
being stupid or not.

523
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,382
Okay, look it.

524
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,965
It's a room, all right?

525
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,095
There is no scientific
data that evil spirits lurk

526
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,261
in physical spaces, all right?

527
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:29,474
It's what you bring into it
psychologically that matters

528
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,058
so let's go.

529
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,268
Thank you.

530
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,979
Okay, I want to retract my
previous demeaning statement

531
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,397
about the female gender.

532
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,566
Chris, you need to amp
up the pussy power.

533
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,567
Right.

534
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,901
Yeah!

535
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,111
Dude, come on.

536
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,364
Hello?

537
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,997
Nic, can
I stay with you?

538
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,500
I'll set my cot
up in the corner.

539
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,002
Come on.

540
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,004
Come on.

541
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,131
Come on, it's amazing.

542
00:23:01,172 --> 00:23:03,133
All right, I claim this bed.

543
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,843
You can sleep with
your boyfriend, Mike.

544
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:05,969
Mm, perfect.

545
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,680
We're gonna snuggle so much.

546
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:11,432
Hey Chris, can I get
like, an interview shot

547
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,100
of you with the
bathroom really quickly.

548
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:14,602
'Cause you're a piece of shit.

549
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,104
Ha ha.

550
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:18,397
Okay, Chris,
how does it feel to stand

551
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,066
in the bathroom where
David Olmos dismembered

552
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,900
all those bodies?

553
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,153
Awesome.

554
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,946
I can take a poop
in peace later.

555
00:23:25,989 --> 00:23:28,490
Thanks, that's all I wanted.

556
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:30,660
Hey, actually, will
you grab me a water

557
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,412
from the mini bar?

558
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:37,875
Amazing.

559
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,543
Jerk!

560
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:42,422
You got me with Fred the Head.

561
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:43,464
Wait, wait, wait.

562
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:44,716
Wait.

563
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,969
He's gonna be our
own little gargoyle.

564
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,471
He'll ward off the
evil spirits, you know?

565
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,557
Oh yeah, if anything,
he'll tow them

566
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,516
right to our room like the
Death Star's tractor beam.

567
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,976
You're
such a fucking nerd.

568
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,979
Okay, guys, we
gotta get geared up.

569
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,938
We're losing light so we
wanna get some more exteriors

570
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,773
before that happens.

571
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:01,982
All right?

572
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:02,817
Over and
out the door, guys.

573
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,526
What's up, minions.

574
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,738
DropTheMike here behind the
creepy deepy Hotel Lenox.

575
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,239
We are in one of its
many back alleys.

576
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,656
Watch out for the
street juice, Chris,

577
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:11,076
it's pretty disgusting.

578
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:13,161
Right here is the
dumpster where David Olmos

579
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:15,120
would dump his
dismembered bodies.

580
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,163
Sweet, baby!

581
00:24:17,582 --> 00:24:18,625
Oh!

582
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,668
Excuse me, miss.

583
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,671
Would you mind if I interview
you for my documentary?

584
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,213
Mind if I ask your name?

585
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,131
Hey, guys.

586
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:28,550
Check out our
neighborhood drug dealer.

587
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:29,635
Oh, shit.

588
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,638
Guys?

589
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,555
Guys.

590
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,431
Oh, okay.

591
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,264
What are you
fucking recording?

592
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,557
Get back here!

593
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:39,603
Hey who
was that, Danni?

594
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,771
One of your exes?

595
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:41,730
So funny, I thought
it was your pimp.

596
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,524
Not funny, guys.

597
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:44,358
Welcome back, kids.

598
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,611
Once again, we're
in the Hotel Lenox.

599
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,278
And right now, I'm
walking down the hallway

600
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,072
where serial killer David Olmos

601
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:53,076
would sneak to this
very fire escape.

602
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:54,827
Am I
following you on this?

603
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,161
Yeah, of course
you're following me.

604
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,248
Why are we friends
with this guy?

605
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,081
Are you coming?

606
00:24:59,124 --> 00:24:59,915
Yeah.

607
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,750
Come on.

608
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:04,169
It's here that David
Olmos would perform

609
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:07,089
his satanic rituals before
heading out into the city

610
00:25:07,132 --> 00:25:08,258
to find his next victim.

611
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,720
How unbelievably
awesome is that.

612
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,928
Whoa.

613
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:14,596
Mike, check out this poor guy.

614
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,682
Oh, somebody is not
having a good day.

615
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,976
Toto, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

616
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:20,269
Bad omen, dude.

617
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,146
Hey, did
you pack the drone?

618
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,273
It's in the pack.

619
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,775
All right, let's unload
the cards from tonight.

620
00:25:25,817 --> 00:25:28,611
Nic'll take care of it
then we can rig our room

621
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,654
with night cams and then
get a good night's sleep

622
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,031
and start fresh in the morning.

623
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,324
A good night's
sleep in this place.

624
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,242
Are you high?

625
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:36,119
Nut attack.

626
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

627
00:26:21,623 --> 00:26:25,125
So this, my friends,
is a 45nm blacklight

628
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,377
that I got for like $100 online.

629
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,631
It's gonna pick up any bad
energy that might be in the room.

630
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:32,384
Meghan Kim's coming for ya.

631
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,051
All right.

632
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:37,889
I think though there's
any blood in here either.

633
00:26:37,931 --> 00:26:40,725
What we need is one
of those ghostbuster lights.

634
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:42,602
Oh man, look at that
creepy little vent

635
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:43,435
above the sink.

636
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,230
I bet this is where
they could smell

637
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,648
Meghan Kim's body burning.

638
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,027
Maybe I should shove some
shish kabobs in there.

639
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,028
Oh wait,
hold on a second.

640
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,237
What?

641
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,699
Did you hear that?

642
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,753
Christopher,
I'm coming to get you.

643
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,088
I'm crawling up the vent.

644
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,298
Shut up, Mike!

645
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,257
Dude, there's
nothing in there.

646
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,091
Come on.

647
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:15,969
How's it going, Nicolai?

648
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,970
Buzz off.

649
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:17,803
I'm working.

650
00:27:17,846 --> 00:27:19,263
That's my girl.

651
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:22,392
You know this is gonna
be like trying to sleep

652
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,351
in a graveyard.

653
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,270
Would cuddling
make you feel bett...

654
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,271
Hey!

655
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,440
- Don't touch.
- Fuck, dude.

656
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,273
I thought you were
gonna punch me.

657
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,316
Save room or Jesus.

658
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:32,860
Danni.

659
00:27:32,902 --> 00:27:34,946
I think little Chrissy
Wissy needs a lullaby.

660
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:36,322
Know any?

661
00:27:36,364 --> 00:27:37,699
Pwease, Danni?

662
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,785
Yeah!

663
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,204
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

664
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:48,293
♪ Rock a bye baby
in the tree tops ♪

665
00:27:48,335 --> 00:27:52,087
♪ And down will come
baby cradle and all ♪

666
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,257
Down will come
baby, cradle and all?

667
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,466
That's supposed to comfort me?

668
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,260
Dude, children's
stories are fucked up.

669
00:27:58,303 --> 00:27:59,304
Wait, that
is really terrifying.

670
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:01,388
I never thought about that.

671
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:03,350
Hey, whatcha got there?

672
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:06,311
Anxiety.

673
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:10,148
Are you
still on those?

674
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,231
Yep.

675
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:16,028
I've actually got my
little ambies right here.

676
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:18,490
This shit fucks you up.

677
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,200
Man, you
guys are a mess.

678
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,201
Fuck you.

679
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,495
Uh, guys.

680
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:28,333
I know I joke around a lot and
shit but I just wanted to say

681
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,750
barricade!

682
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,505
This is why I
wanted my own bed!

683
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:34,963
Come to me, my children!

684
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,257
I'm gonna fart,
I'm gonna fart.

685
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,133
- Don't fart!
- I will squash you

686
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,134
with the pillow.

687
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:39,426
I shall squash you.

688
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:41,846
Oh, I farted so
bad right on Chris.

689
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:43,681
Did you set an alarm?

690
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,515
Yeah.

691
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:45,642
Okay.

692
00:28:45,683 --> 00:28:46,475
Night, guys.

693
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,812
Goodnight.

694
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:57,528
Mike, get your
hand off of my butt!

695
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,196
Did you guys hear that?

696
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,155
That's not funny.

697
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:01,865
No, seriously.

698
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,826
Oh fuck, Fred fell.

699
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,868
Oh no.

700
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:06,663
Hang on, I got it.

701
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:07,496
That's creepy.

702
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,125
How did you fall, dude?

703
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,110
We're heading down to the
basement where Meghan Kim's

704
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:22,447
dead body was found in
the back boiler room.

705
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,033
And if that's not sick enough,

706
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,995
we're gonna try out
the drone down there.

707
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:30,872
Whoa.

708
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:33,875
Weird deja vu moment again.

709
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,293
You guys didn't get that?

710
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,127
No.

711
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,880
Oh get this, get this.

712
00:30:38,922 --> 00:30:39,963
No trespassing.

713
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:47,054
Crap, oh seriously?

714
00:30:47,096 --> 00:30:48,889
Oh, dude we need bolt cutters.

715
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,141
Dude, you can't
get through that.

716
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,893
I can figure it out.

717
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:53,602
Here, take this and set up
the camera over there, okay?

718
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,855
You don't have super powers
by any chance, do you?

719
00:30:55,896 --> 00:30:57,564
I got pussy power.

720
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,653
You're not as funny
as you think you are.

721
00:31:02,695 --> 00:31:03,487
Whoa.

722
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:04,905
Oh, hey there we go.

723
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:05,990
I think that I can
fit it through.

724
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,117
You boys struggling
to make something fit?

725
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:08,951
Ha.

726
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,412
I love you, Danni.

727
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:11,663
Okay.

728
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,288
You got the picture up.

729
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,164
Yeah.

730
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:18,002
It's gonna be so cool.

731
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,257
Okay, here we go.

732
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,509
Ooh, that is creepy.

733
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,551
Look at that.

734
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:28,138
I think I found a new
dream home for me and Jess.

735
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,890
This
hallway on the left?

736
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:33,351
Wait, go the other way first.

737
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:36,312
Do you see those?

738
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,565
Oh, that's random.

739
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,650
Huh, it's a cheap
date for Christopher.

740
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,070
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

741
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:44,903
Check that out.

742
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,363
Is that a person?

743
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:52,369
Nah, it's just
another creepy mannequin.

744
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:55,539
Okay, go back to the hallway.

745
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,000
You're really good at this.

746
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,167
Your fingers are quite magic.

747
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,044
I know.

748
00:32:00,086 --> 00:32:01,337
Those stairs?

749
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:02,379
Mm-hmm.

750
00:32:02,422 --> 00:32:03,423
Can you go down them?

751
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:04,298
Descend.

752
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,134
Descend into the dark...

753
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,221
Whoa.

754
00:32:10,262 --> 00:32:11,680
Where is it?
What happened to the feed?

755
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:12,765
What happened?

756
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:13,599
Dude, what did you do?

757
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:14,642
Mike, will you stop?

758
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,101
We have to find this
thing, I have to return it.

759
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:16,935
Can I help you?

760
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,480
Oh, busted.

761
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:22,107
I know what you guys
are doing down here.

762
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:25,194
Listen, I'm a huge
fan of your vlog.

763
00:32:25,236 --> 00:32:26,988
You're DropTheMike
and shit, right?

764
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,030
Yeah, dude.

765
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:29,157
Nice to meet you.

766
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,240
Wow, thank you for watching.

767
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,700
Yeah, of course.

768
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:32,576
I love it but, you know,

769
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:35,579
I still can't let you
in there with all,

770
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:36,748
you know, all the
electrical boxes and shit.

771
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,249
What's your name, man?

772
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,125
- Tony.
- Tony, nice to meet you.

773
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:39,958
Mike.

774
00:32:40,999 --> 00:32:41,336
Do you wanna...

775
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:42,169
why don't you come down here
and say hi to my followers?

776
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,212
What's up, guys?

777
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,089
Tony, you like movies?

778
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:46,341
Yeah, who doesn't?

779
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:48,509
Could you ever see
yourself working security

780
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,220
on a big studio lot?

781
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,596
Holy shit, that'd be awesome.

782
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:52,721
Yeah?

783
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,099
Management, she has a
meeting like, tomorrow night.

784
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,477
I might be able to
snag you a key then.

785
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,144
You can just, I
don't know, like

786
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:01,230
stick the key in an envelope
and put it through my door.

787
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:02,106
Yeah, absolutely.

788
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,357
Amazing.

789
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,110
Hey, do you have any
like insider knowledge

790
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:08,113
about the Meghan Kim thing?

791
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,490
You guys know about The
Elevator Ritual, right?

792
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:13,158
No, I do not know about
The Elevator Ritual.

793
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:16,037
Look up The Elevator
Ritual online,

794
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:19,124
then rewatch the Meghan
Kim elevator footage.

795
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,084
It'll get you
closer to the truth.

796
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:24,295
Okay, so apparently, there
is a popular Korean game

797
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,504
called The Elevator Ritual.

798
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:26,631
What is that?

799
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,549
So first, you have to have
a hotel that is at least

800
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,300
10 floors, which lucky for us,

801
00:33:30,343 --> 00:33:31,594
Lenox has more than 10 floors.

802
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,721
Mmm, of course.

803
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:36,765
Then you enter the elevator
on the first floor alone.

804
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,144
You then go to the following
floors in this precise order.

805
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,104
You go to the fourth,
second, sixth,

806
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:42,813
second, 10th, and then fifth.

807
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:43,690
This is fascinating.

808
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,692
Okay, it gets more
interesting, okay?

809
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:48,653
When you reach the
fifth floor, a woman

810
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:49,528
is supposed to enter.

811
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,779
Ooh, a woman.

812
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:52,031
And then you have
mad, crazy sex.

813
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:53,324
No,

814
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:55,160
you're not supposed to look
at her or speak to her.

815
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,370
Then you press the
first floor button.

816
00:33:57,412 --> 00:33:59,456
If the elevator
descends to the lobby,

817
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,207
you exit quickly
without looking back.

818
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,293
But, if instead of
going to the lobby,

819
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,127
the elevator goes
to the 10th floor,

820
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,130
you exit and the
woman's going to ask,

821
00:34:07,172 --> 00:34:08,548
"Where are you going?"

822
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,800
You are not supposed to answer
her or even look at her.

823
00:34:10,842 --> 00:34:12,594
What happens next?

824
00:34:12,635 --> 00:34:14,137
Apparently, you enter

825
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,305
the other world.

826
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,057
And what is that
supposed to be?

827
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:19,059
I don't know but

828
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,228
check out Meghan Kim's video.

829
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,438
See that?

830
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,148
Wait, what
is she pressing?

831
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,858
Okay, so the buttons
she pressed were one,

832
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,278
five, 10, two, six, two, four.

833
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,529
That's not the order
you said, though.

834
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,490
No.

835
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,699
It is the order, just reversed.

836
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:39,371
My guess is that Meghan Kim
played The Elevator Ritual

837
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,872
the night before and the
night that she disappeared,

838
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,583
she was trying to undo it by
pressing the buttons backwards.

839
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,127
I'm gonna do it so you don't
need to get your panties

840
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:47,628
in a bunch, you don't
have to go with me

841
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,089
'cause it does say that you
have to do it alone, so.

842
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,216
I hope I come back, guys.

843
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,426
This is wrong, Mike.

844
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,595
Dude, relax.

845
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:56,805
Yeah, I'm with her.

846
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:57,639
All right, let's get ready.

847
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,722
Let's do it.

848
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:01,558
Okay, mighty minions,
it's just after midnight.

849
00:35:01,601 --> 00:35:03,394
I'm all rigged up for
The Elevator Ritual.

850
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,771
I got my fancy little
button cam, a handheld

851
00:35:05,813 --> 00:35:07,856
so we got multiple
angles for you guys,

852
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:10,109
and in the words of
cinematic thespian,

853
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,903
Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger,

854
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:14,447
I'll be back.

855
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,657
Don't wait up, kids.

856
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,451
Be careful.

857
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:22,288
Okay, minions.

858
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,331
We're about to embark
on The Elevator Ritual,

859
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:25,541
starting on the first floor.

860
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:28,128
Tony the security guard
totally hooked me up

861
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,129
and shut off the security
camera in the elevator

862
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,714
for 10 whole minutes.

863
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,174
Tell Jess I love her.

864
00:35:34,217 --> 00:35:36,177
Okay, so as the rules mandate,

865
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:39,389
we're going to the
fourth floor first.

866
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,893
Fourth floor.

867
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,144
Going down.

868
00:35:45,186 --> 00:35:46,896
That wasn't so bad.

869
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:49,148
Now we head down to two.

870
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,193
I feel like the
world's slowest yo-yo.

871
00:35:52,235 --> 00:35:54,278
Second floor.

872
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,155
Going up.

873
00:35:55,947 --> 00:35:57,657
Number six is next.

874
00:35:58,907 --> 00:36:01,661
Sixth floor.

875
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:02,661
Going down.

876
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,461
Man, this game is crazy.

877
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:20,221
Second floor.

878
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,307
Huh, this seems familiar.

879
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,934
Going up.

880
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:27,186
Whoa.

881
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:42,994
10th floor.

882
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,663
Okay, so some faulty wiring.

883
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,500
But so far, all is good.

884
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:50,418
All right, final floor.

885
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,838
Going down.

886
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,715
My heart's pounding
for some reason.

887
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,779
Fifth floor.

888
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:27,038
All right.

889
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:27,913
Debunked.

890
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,458
Let's head back down to one.

891
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:32,335
What?

892
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,927
Let's head on home.

893
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,849
Oh.

894
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:47,684
You lost, son?

895
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:48,559
No, no, I'm fine.

896
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:49,394
Thank you so much.

897
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:50,269
Okay.

898
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,528
Okay, guys.

899
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,739
Looks like the
Korean elevator game

900
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,574
is indeed a big hoax.

901
00:38:02,614 --> 00:38:05,409
I knew it from the get-go.

902
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:19,591
Where are you going?

903
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:50,413
Right there, right there.

904
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:52,998
What?

905
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:54,417
Is that the fifth floor?

906
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:55,376
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

907
00:38:55,418 --> 00:38:57,378
Okay, right there.

908
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,463
What?

909
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,465
What, that's Meghan Kim, dude.

910
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,966
You didn't say anything
to her, did you?

911
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:04,427
No, no, no, of course I
didn't say anything to her.

912
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,720
- What?
- I was terrified.

913
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,472
My heart has never
beat that fast before.

914
00:39:07,514 --> 00:39:08,640
It was crazy, I've
never been that scared.

915
00:39:08,681 --> 00:39:09,473
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

916
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:10,474
You hired a look-alike.

917
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,684
No, no, I swear.

918
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:13,103
I swear I did not hire
a look-alike, okay?

919
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:13,936
Dude, are you

920
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,063
- messing around?
- Was this you guys?

921
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:15,896
No, it wasn't us!

922
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:16,815
It wasn't you guys?

923
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:17,941
'Cause if it was, please fess up

924
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,692
'cause I will worship the
ground that you walk on.

925
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:21,485
Seriously, okay?

926
00:39:21,527 --> 00:39:22,528
Dude, this isn't a joke!

927
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,530
Are you kidding me?

928
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,364
Look at the video, that's her.

929
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:27,075
You know what this means?

930
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,410
It means we're gone.
That's her.

931
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:29,661
No, no, no.

932
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:30,704
Dude, this was one
of my fucking fans!

933
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:31,913
- No, Mike.
- No.

934
00:39:31,954 --> 00:39:33,831
One of my followers
dressed up as Meghan Kim

935
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:35,458
and came to the hotel
just to scare me.

936
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,001
- Oh, that's amazing.
- No, you're wrong!

937
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:37,961
I love you guys.

938
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:38,878
Ugh!

939
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,838
Dude, look at the picture.

940
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,130
That is her.

941
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,757
You're messing with
your life, Michael.

942
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,634
She doesn't look
like Meghan Kim, okay?

943
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:46,719
Look, we will go compare
it to the footage

944
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,179
from the actual elevator video.

945
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:49,179
She looks nothing
like Meghan Kim, okay?

946
00:39:49,222 --> 00:39:50,807
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

947
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:51,682
God, I'm sweating so much.

948
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:52,641
Okay, come on.

949
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:55,437
Come on, come on, come on.

950
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:56,688
Dude,
that's the same girl.

951
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,733
That is not the
same person at all.

952
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,152
I could
go either way, guys.

953
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,194
Come on, Danni.

954
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,948
Who's that?

955
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,490
Did you hear that?

956
00:40:09,576 --> 00:40:11,036
What's going on?

957
00:40:11,077 --> 00:40:12,037
Who's out there?

958
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:13,954
There's nobody out here.

959
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:15,205
Come here.

960
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:16,041
Mike,
they just knocked.

961
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:17,375
They couldn't have
hid that quick.

962
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,208
I don't see
anybody, dude, okay?

963
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:19,711
It's not like a...

964
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,422
Is anybody out here?

965
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:23,547
No,
there's nobody here.

966
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,423
Weird.

967
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:27,177
I don't know.

968
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:34,141
Who was it?

969
00:40:34,184 --> 00:40:36,603
They ran away again.

970
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:37,436
I don't know.

971
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,480
Nothing?

972
00:40:41,023 --> 00:40:41,940
What is this?

973
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:42,901
Another earthquake, Mike?

974
00:40:42,942 --> 00:40:44,152
Dude.

975
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:45,695
They couldn't
have hid that fast.

976
00:40:45,737 --> 00:40:46,905
It's probably
just Nic messing with us.

977
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:47,739
I can't believe
I'm locking in myself

978
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,074
in David Olmos's room.

979
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,908
They're really good
at this, it's amazing.

980
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:53,202
Guys, guys, guys, chill.

981
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,454
It's just,

982
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:56,498
it's my text messages, okay?

983
00:40:56,539 --> 00:40:58,792
It's Jess, she wants
to Skype with me.

984
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,585
Just, you guys
have a few minutes.

985
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:01,753
Just relax, I'm
sorry it scared you.

986
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,213
Just chill, okay?

987
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:16,100
Hey, babe.

988
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,726
How's everything going, hun?

989
00:41:17,768 --> 00:41:19,478
It's good.

990
00:41:19,521 --> 00:41:21,523
Going awesome, how are you?

991
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,107
Yeah, it's really
busy right now.

992
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,650
They asked me to work a double,

993
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:28,655
lots of injuries, bunch
of drunks and such,

994
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:31,950
just typical
Halloween Eve stuff.

995
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,242
I can imagine.

996
00:41:33,284 --> 00:41:37,414
Just careful around
those drunk idiots, okay?

997
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:38,248
I'll let you get back to work.

998
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,791
Wait.

999
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,126
What's up?

1000
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:44,211
I wanted to wait
until you got home

1001
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:46,547
for me to tell you this but

1002
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,132
the administration
asked the entire staff

1003
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:49,342
to take a blood test last week,

1004
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:53,762
just usual drug testing stuff,
but they said that they found

1005
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:56,181
something unusual in my blood.

1006
00:41:57,349 --> 00:41:58,684
Unusual?

1007
00:41:58,726 --> 00:42:02,021
Yeah, it's called
chorionic gonadotropin.

1008
00:42:02,063 --> 00:42:03,565
Jesus, what is that?

1009
00:42:03,606 --> 00:42:05,525
More accurately,
it's referred to

1010
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,068
as human chorionic gonadotropin.

1011
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:08,902
Well what is it?

1012
00:42:08,945 --> 00:42:09,738
Is it a disease?

1013
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:10,780
I mean...

1014
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:12,532
I'm pregnant, Michael.

1015
00:42:12,574 --> 00:42:14,075
You're pregnant?

1016
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,702
Did Chris put you up to this?

1017
00:42:16,744 --> 00:42:17,828
No.

1018
00:42:17,871 --> 00:42:19,039
I'm completely serious.

1019
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,581
I mean, they already
confirmed it.

1020
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:23,876
Babe, we're gonna have a baby.

1021
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:25,628
We're gonna have a baby.

1022
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:26,796
Oh, man.

1023
00:42:26,838 --> 00:42:28,131
How does that make you feel?

1024
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:29,715
Uh, my mind is

1025
00:42:31,592 --> 00:42:33,594
completely blown, but...

1026
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:37,014
This is fantastic news.

1027
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:37,890
I mean,

1028
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,853
I mean, God, it's
unexpected as shit, but...

1029
00:42:41,894 --> 00:42:43,188
Are we getting this right now?

1030
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,688
Yeah.

1031
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:47,901
Listen, I gotta
go back to work, but

1032
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:50,737
we'll celebrate
when you get home?

1033
00:42:50,778 --> 00:42:52,989
Yeah, no, we'll celebrate when

1034
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:54,990
we get home, absolutely.

1035
00:42:55,909 --> 00:42:56,785
Love you.

1036
00:42:58,661 --> 00:43:00,163
I love you more.

1037
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,082
Okay.

1038
00:43:02,123 --> 00:43:03,041
Okay.

1039
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:03,916
Yeah.

1040
00:43:08,295 --> 00:43:09,838
Say what?

1041
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,590
Oh my God!

1042
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:12,675
That's massive!

1043
00:43:14,302 --> 00:43:15,135
Oh my God.

1044
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,141
Okay.

1045
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,813
You heard it here first.

1046
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:31,110
Wat are you guys
talking about?

1047
00:43:31,152 --> 00:43:34,030
- Don't worry about it.
- Nothing.

1048
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:35,323
Oh, that's so...

1049
00:43:37,242 --> 00:43:39,661
Danni, are you getting that?

1050
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:40,619
The noise?

1051
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:41,954
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

1052
00:43:41,996 --> 00:43:43,748
What is that?

1053
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,083
I don't know, dude.

1054
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:46,668
Just chill out, please.

1055
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,003
The hotel's like 90
years old, come on.

1056
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:50,672
Trust me, my 90
year-old grandmother

1057
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:53,340
made a lot worse
noises than that.

1058
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:55,427
What is going on?

1059
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:56,594
Danni, did you pick that up?

1060
00:43:56,635 --> 00:43:57,429
Yeah.

1061
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,054
It sounds like it's Nic's room.

1062
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:01,932
Dude, can you go check on her?

1063
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:02,891
Dude, just...

1064
00:44:02,934 --> 00:44:04,102
Please just go over there.

1065
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,102
Yeah, camera?

1066
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:06,730
Always.

1067
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:13,028
Hey, Nic?

1068
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:16,322
Hey, do you have that
overnight footage ready yet?

1069
00:44:16,364 --> 00:44:18,867
I wanna see how it turned out.

1070
00:44:31,295 --> 00:44:32,129
Nic?

1071
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,135
Christopher!

1072
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:40,387
I have six new video
cards to download and cut.

1073
00:44:40,429 --> 00:44:42,014
I don't have time
for you to be playing

1074
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:43,807
your stupid junior
high school games.

1075
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,184
Now will you please

1076
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:46,227
just shut up

1077
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:49,313
and close the door?

1078
00:44:49,356 --> 00:44:50,273
Jesus, Nic.

1079
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:51,148
Your nose.

1080
00:44:53,735 --> 00:44:54,986
Shit, I'm fine.

1081
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:56,195
I am fine.

1082
00:44:56,237 --> 00:44:57,780
Now just give me
some freaking space!

1083
00:44:57,822 --> 00:45:00,200
Okay, jeez, jeez.

1084
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,374
Ugh, now what?

1085
00:45:10,793 --> 00:45:12,336
Hello?

1086
00:45:18,259 --> 00:45:19,719
You okay, dude?

1087
00:45:23,264 --> 00:45:24,432
Too much wine?

1088
00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:30,188
Mike!

1089
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:32,315
Mike, Mike, Mike!

1090
00:45:32,356 --> 00:45:33,315
Mike, Mike!

1091
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:34,442
Jesus, dude, what is it?

1092
00:45:34,483 --> 00:45:37,444
This guy at the
end of the hallway, his head!

1093
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:38,363
What about his head?

1094
00:45:38,405 --> 00:45:40,740
It bent
backwards all unnatural.

1095
00:45:40,782 --> 00:45:41,740
What?

1096
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:42,616
Yeah, yeah.

1097
00:45:42,659 --> 00:45:43,451
Just completely un-human.

1098
00:45:43,492 --> 00:45:44,284
Wait, where?

1099
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:45,120
There's nobody here, dude.

1100
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:46,788
Where did he go?

1101
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:47,706
He was right there.

1102
00:45:47,746 --> 00:45:50,500
You think he went
out the fire escape?

1103
00:45:50,541 --> 00:45:51,750
It's open.

1104
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:54,086
Are you sure you saw someone?

1105
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:55,797
Yes, I'm
sure I saw someone.

1106
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:57,047
There's nobody up here, okay?

1107
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,173
Wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1108
00:45:58,215 --> 00:45:59,384
What's that?

1109
00:45:59,425 --> 00:46:00,844
Oh, what?

1110
00:46:00,885 --> 00:46:02,554
What is that?

1111
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:03,679
It's right on top of...

1112
00:46:03,722 --> 00:46:04,514
Oh!

1113
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:06,307
A satanic symbol.

1114
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:08,393
Oh, it's just like the
one that David Olmos

1115
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:09,601
has on his hand.

1116
00:46:09,643 --> 00:46:10,894
Wait, isn't this
right where our room is, guys?

1117
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:12,021
Oh, man.

1118
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:14,774
But there's
not even room service

1119
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:15,817
in this hotel, is there?

1120
00:46:15,858 --> 00:46:16,692
No, not for decades.

1121
00:46:16,735 --> 00:46:17,527
Mike, don't touch it.

1122
00:46:17,568 --> 00:46:18,527
Don't touch it.

1123
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,571
It's warm.

1124
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:20,447
Mike.

1125
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:22,907
Oh!

1126
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:25,744
Oh, that is so gross.

1127
00:46:25,784 --> 00:46:26,577
Oh, that's disgusting.

1128
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:27,579
Oh my God, it smells.

1129
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:28,579
I can't.

1130
00:46:28,621 --> 00:46:29,414
There's something...

1131
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:30,248
What is that?

1132
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:31,416
I think it's a tongue?

1133
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:32,834
It's a tongue.

1134
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,085
Don't.

1135
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:35,961
Please don't touch it.

1136
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:36,920
I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna do it.

1137
00:46:36,963 --> 00:46:37,756
I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna do it.

1138
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:38,590
I can't.

1139
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,596
Guys, chill, it's not human.

1140
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:46,972
How do you know that?

1141
00:46:47,014 --> 00:46:48,849
Because it's
way too big, okay?

1142
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,309
They would have had
to gut Gene Simmons.

1143
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:53,145
Mike, I actually don't
feel comfortable with this.

1144
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:55,273
We should talk
to hotel management.

1145
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:56,398
Call the cops, man.

1146
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,150
No, they'll kick us out
and we'll lose the shoot.

1147
00:46:58,193 --> 00:46:59,444
Look, this isn't about

1148
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:01,945
ghastly spirits, they
don't exist, okay?

1149
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:05,282
I'm sorry that like, you're
concerned right now but...

1150
00:47:05,324 --> 00:47:08,285
Look, don't tell me that
I'm overreacting, okay?

1151
00:47:08,327 --> 00:47:09,496
- Dude, Christopher.
- Chris, Chris.

1152
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:10,954
And don't
tell me that I'm losing

1153
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:11,955
some type of control.

1154
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:13,375
Stop, stop.

1155
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,459
Watch your step, watch
your step, watch your step.

1156
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,086
All right, you've got to
admit it's pretty awesome

1157
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:17,711
that the vlog is
getting interactive.

1158
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:18,545
Interactive?

1159
00:47:18,588 --> 00:47:19,381
Yeah.

1160
00:47:19,422 --> 00:47:20,632
No, this is demonic.

1161
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:23,300
Dude, if dastardly
demons were real,

1162
00:47:23,342 --> 00:47:24,927
then nobody would be
staying in this hotel.

1163
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:26,471
That's what you
don't get, Mike.

1164
00:47:26,512 --> 00:47:27,931
It's not about them being real,

1165
00:47:27,972 --> 00:47:29,599
it's about you provoking them.

1166
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:30,642
Okay, you need to relax.

1167
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,185
Here.

1168
00:47:32,226 --> 00:47:33,478
Mama's little helper.

1169
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:35,438
It's way better than
that anxiety bullcrap

1170
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,648
you've been taking.

1171
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:37,648
You'll get better dreams, too.

1172
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,192
I would advise against that.

1173
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,985
Hey, not helpful.

1174
00:47:41,027 --> 00:47:42,153
There you go.

1175
00:47:42,195 --> 00:47:43,153
Thatta boy.

1176
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:46,074
Seriously, dude,
it's gonna help.

1177
00:47:46,115 --> 00:47:47,449
All right, guys.

1178
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:51,453
I mean, that's
hardcore but let's...

1179
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:53,664
Let's head downstairs
and we'll set a trap

1180
00:47:53,706 --> 00:47:55,165
for whoever's been
knocking on the door

1181
00:47:55,208 --> 00:47:56,418
in the morning, okay?

1182
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,210
It's probably the same
DropTheMike follower

1183
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:00,505
as whoever did
this, so, all right?

1184
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:03,382
Yes, can we go?

1185
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:04,259
Agreed.

1186
00:48:14,686 --> 00:48:17,271
Hey, Christopher said
your nose was bleeding.

1187
00:48:17,313 --> 00:48:18,398
Are you okay?

1188
00:48:22,027 --> 00:48:23,110
Are you okay?

1189
00:48:33,579 --> 00:48:34,413
Nic.

1190
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:57,061
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1191
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:58,563
Talk to me, what's wrong?

1192
00:48:58,605 --> 00:48:59,646
What's wrong?

1193
00:48:59,688 --> 00:49:00,565
Fuck.

1194
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:03,233
Oh God, you're recording
this, aren't you?

1195
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:04,234
No, no, no, no.

1196
00:49:04,277 --> 00:49:05,320
It's just a force of habit.

1197
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:06,488
You'll edit it out later, okay?

1198
00:49:06,528 --> 00:49:07,947
Okay, please edit it out.

1199
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,157
My God.

1200
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:10,575
Hey, hey, come on.

1201
00:49:10,617 --> 00:49:12,035
No, no, no, I just...

1202
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:13,286
Just seems like a

1203
00:49:14,161 --> 00:49:15,663
lot of

1204
00:49:15,704 --> 00:49:18,958
energies are boiling up
inside of me this weekend.

1205
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,585
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1206
00:49:20,626 --> 00:49:22,753
Hey listen, just
do me a favor.

1207
00:49:22,795 --> 00:49:25,172
I want you to get
some sleep tonight

1208
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:26,591
and stop editing
for a little bit.

1209
00:49:26,632 --> 00:49:27,966
You can worry about
it in the morning.

1210
00:49:28,009 --> 00:49:30,010
No, there's gonna
be too much to finish.

1211
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:32,262
No, no, no, there isn't, okay?

1212
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:34,098
Look, look, everybody knows
we're on a time crunch.

1213
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:35,974
You don't need to make
things as flawless

1214
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,018
as you normally do.

1215
00:49:37,059 --> 00:49:38,686
I'm sorry, I'm so embarrassed.

1216
00:49:38,728 --> 00:49:40,105
No, no, no, no.

1217
00:49:40,146 --> 00:49:42,981
Don't be sorry, don't be sorry.

1218
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,735
All right, you're gonna
get some sleep, right?

1219
00:49:46,777 --> 00:49:47,736
Okay.

1220
00:49:47,778 --> 00:49:48,612
All right.

1221
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,427
I need way more
subscribers, guys.

1222
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:11,301
Come on.

1223
00:50:12,429 --> 00:50:15,139
You've gotta help me out here.

1224
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:19,019
Okay.

1225
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,649
Danni, you awake?

1226
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,235
Are you sleeping?

1227
00:50:27,277 --> 00:50:29,112
Far from it.

1228
00:50:30,655 --> 00:50:34,451
You watch Chris's
footage of the headless guy?

1229
00:50:34,492 --> 00:50:35,618
Yeah.

1230
00:50:35,659 --> 00:50:38,328
That was freaky as hell.

1231
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,625
You want?

1232
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,048
Everybody's
doing it, right?

1233
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:49,923
Right on.

1234
00:52:01,161 --> 00:52:02,621
Hey, guys, so

1235
00:52:02,664 --> 00:52:05,875
we're waiting for my
super fan or whoever it is

1236
00:52:05,916 --> 00:52:08,210
that's been trolling us
and knocking on the door so

1237
00:52:08,253 --> 00:52:10,838
we're just doing a little
stakeout right now.

1238
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,258
It's been super interesting
so far so I thought I'd

1239
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:14,259
clue you guys in.

1240
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,135
Anyways.

1241
00:52:20,931 --> 00:52:22,641
Is that a good idea?

1242
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:26,146
They're just walking
away, it's fine.

1243
00:52:27,271 --> 00:52:28,273
Hey, Chris.

1244
00:52:28,313 --> 00:52:29,440
Want floor on your food.

1245
00:52:29,481 --> 00:52:30,442
No!

1246
00:52:30,483 --> 00:52:31,526
What is that?

1247
00:52:32,985 --> 00:52:33,777
Stop, man.

1248
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,196
You guys are like,
awkwardly close.

1249
00:52:35,237 --> 00:52:36,196
You know that, right?

1250
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:37,240
Eh.

1251
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:38,658
Wait.

1252
00:52:38,699 --> 00:52:42,244
I don't think I actually
know how you guys met.

1253
00:52:42,286 --> 00:52:44,204
Let's see, elementary school.

1254
00:52:44,246 --> 00:52:45,205
No.

1255
00:52:45,248 --> 00:52:46,331
No, it was...

1256
00:52:49,001 --> 00:52:52,212
We met at the
psychiatrist's office.

1257
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:54,506
Yep, we were in the...

1258
00:52:54,548 --> 00:52:55,717
No, you're messing with me.

1259
00:52:55,759 --> 00:52:56,717
No, yeah.

1260
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:57,969
We were in the waiting room.

1261
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:01,264
I knew you guys were
totally screwed up.

1262
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:02,432
All right, boys.

1263
00:53:03,266 --> 00:53:05,226
What were you in for?

1264
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,228
I don't know.

1265
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:08,646
Parent shit.

1266
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:10,481
I'll be right back.

1267
00:53:10,523 --> 00:53:11,983
Where you going?

1268
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:16,863
I'm gonna give my pee ration
at the urination station.

1269
00:53:18,864 --> 00:53:20,657
You know, for a guy who
really likes the sound

1270
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,284
of his own voice,
that was pretty weird.

1271
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:24,454
Well, get down to the
good stuff and he bolts.

1272
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,668
This would be like, a
really good time to tell me

1273
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,255
why you stopped calling
me over the summer.

1274
00:53:34,297 --> 00:53:35,423
Are you not gonna tell me?

1275
00:53:35,465 --> 00:53:36,257
No.

1276
00:53:36,298 --> 00:53:37,300
No?

1277
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:39,677
Tell me.

1278
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:40,804
Okay, okay.

1279
00:53:43,222 --> 00:53:46,393
The pain started to
outweigh the pleasure.

1280
00:53:46,434 --> 00:53:48,353
Mike, is that you?

1281
00:53:48,394 --> 00:53:49,813
What is
that supposed to mean?

1282
00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:50,771
Mike, I can't see you, buddy.

1283
00:53:50,813 --> 00:53:51,730
You gotta...

1284
00:53:51,773 --> 00:53:54,317
I can't see you, it's too dark.

1285
00:53:54,358 --> 00:53:55,485
I loved you.

1286
00:53:55,527 --> 00:54:00,240
Mike, man, I am so sorry
about everything that happened.

1287
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,784
Yo, have you been in
contact with Chris or Danni?

1288
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:04,828
And I knew

1289
00:54:08,748 --> 00:54:11,001
that you didn't
feel the same way.

1290
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,752
I don't know, I sound like
a Hallmark card right now.

1291
00:54:13,795 --> 00:54:15,338
Like a little.

1292
00:54:16,047 --> 00:54:17,257
Chris,

1293
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:22,303
you know that you've
always been like,

1294
00:54:22,344 --> 00:54:24,263
a brother to me, right?

1295
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:26,432
Mm-hmm.

1296
00:54:28,434 --> 00:54:30,353
I mean, when you
stopped calling me, it was

1297
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:32,355
kind of a void for me too.

1298
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:37,735
I don't know, it's a
two-way street, I guess.

1299
00:54:37,777 --> 00:54:38,820
Woo!

1300
00:54:40,070 --> 00:54:42,656
I just expelled a
foul demon out my ass.

1301
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:44,075
TMI, dude.

1302
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:45,827
So what were
you guys talking about?

1303
00:54:45,869 --> 00:54:47,077
Nothing, Mike.

1304
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,038
Okay, whatever dude.

1305
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:52,041
Hey, so I was thinking we
can finish up lunch soon.

1306
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,043
I don't think anybody's
gonna show up right now

1307
00:54:54,085 --> 00:54:55,295
so we might as well.

1308
00:54:55,336 --> 00:54:56,170
What the...

1309
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,884
I think I know that
kid from somewhere.

1310
00:55:03,762 --> 00:55:05,347
You know him?

1311
00:55:05,387 --> 00:55:06,472
Hey, kid!

1312
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:07,474
I'll be right back.

1313
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:08,599
Kid, wait up.

1314
00:55:08,641 --> 00:55:09,476
Mike,
where are you going?

1315
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:10,351
What do you mean you know him?

1316
00:55:10,393 --> 00:55:11,436
Mike?

1317
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,355
Mike!

1318
00:55:16,483 --> 00:55:18,318
I'm gonna go find him.

1319
00:55:19,485 --> 00:55:20,319
Mike?

1320
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:22,321
Mike!

1321
00:55:24,157 --> 00:55:26,326
Where'd he go?

1322
00:55:26,367 --> 00:55:27,284
Do you see him?

1323
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:28,119
He's gone.

1324
00:55:32,498 --> 00:55:34,375
Hey kid, wait.

1325
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:36,670
He's not here.

1326
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,545
Dude, I don't know.

1327
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:40,006
We should check on Nic.

1328
00:55:40,047 --> 00:55:41,465
No, no, no, no.

1329
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:43,759
Leave her alone, she
was upset earlier.

1330
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:44,803
Is that...

1331
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:47,429
Does that...

1332
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:49,474
What?

1333
00:55:49,516 --> 00:55:50,392
Chris?

1334
00:55:50,432 --> 00:55:51,434
Danni?

1335
00:55:51,476 --> 00:55:52,811
Chris?

1336
00:55:52,851 --> 00:55:54,895
Chris, turn on
your camera light.

1337
00:55:54,938 --> 00:55:56,106
Chris!

1338
00:55:57,856 --> 00:55:59,567
Danni, run!

1339
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:01,820
Danni, open the door!

1340
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:03,070
Do you have the key?

1341
00:56:03,112 --> 00:56:04,697
No, I
don't have a key.

1342
00:56:04,739 --> 00:56:05,782
Fuck, fuck.

1343
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:07,409
Danni, open the door.

1344
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:08,534
Okay, okay.

1345
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:11,371
- Wait, wait.
- Do you hear that?

1346
00:56:11,413 --> 00:56:12,414
Wait.

1347
00:56:17,835 --> 00:56:18,877
Hey, kid.

1348
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:19,753
Hey.

1349
00:56:20,713 --> 00:56:22,965
Where do I know you from?

1350
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,896
Hey.

1351
00:56:48,449 --> 00:56:50,076
Fold up the tripod.

1352
00:56:50,117 --> 00:56:51,744
Fold up the tripod.

1353
00:56:53,246 --> 00:56:54,456
Get behind me.

1354
00:56:54,496 --> 00:56:55,456
Get behind me.

1355
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:57,916
Whoa, oh my God.

1356
00:56:57,958 --> 00:56:59,210
- Oh my God.
- Mike?

1357
00:56:59,251 --> 00:57:00,128
What the hell are
you guys doing here?

1358
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:01,046
What are you doing here?

1359
00:57:01,086 --> 00:57:02,630
We thought you were
gone chasing that kid.

1360
00:57:02,672 --> 00:57:03,757
How did you...

1361
00:57:03,797 --> 00:57:04,757
Did you see Olmas?

1362
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:06,425
What are you talking about?

1363
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:07,301
There was a guy out
there who looked like him.

1364
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:09,929
I was just knocking
on room 440, okay?

1365
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:10,764
Stop messing with us, Mike!

1366
00:57:10,804 --> 00:57:11,931
We saw him out there!

1367
00:57:11,972 --> 00:57:12,931
Jesus, Chris!

1368
00:57:12,974 --> 00:57:14,601
I am not messing with you, okay?

1369
00:57:14,641 --> 00:57:16,018
I was knocking on room 440

1370
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:17,644
and you guys answered the door.

1371
00:57:17,686 --> 00:57:20,522
I don't know what's
happening, okay?

1372
00:57:20,565 --> 00:57:23,985
Check my footage if
you don't believe me.

1373
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:26,738
What happened?

1374
00:57:33,619 --> 00:57:35,454
What is this?

1375
00:57:35,496 --> 00:57:37,248
I don't know, dude,
leftover drone footage.

1376
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:38,123
No, it's not!

1377
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:39,250
I remember shooting
that drone footage...

1378
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:41,126
Chris, stop yelling at me!

1379
00:57:41,168 --> 00:57:43,754
Okay, boys, sit down!

1380
00:57:43,797 --> 00:57:46,590
Did you not just see that
guy outside with the hacksaw?

1381
00:57:46,632 --> 00:57:48,926
What guy with
the hacksaw, okay?

1382
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:49,885
We got it on video, listen...

1383
00:57:49,927 --> 00:57:50,929
I don't care, Danni.

1384
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,179
The hallway was empty.

1385
00:57:52,222 --> 00:57:54,599
I was just knocking on a
door on the fourth floor

1386
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:56,059
and I don't know what happened.

1387
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:57,268
What were you
doing at room 440?

1388
00:57:57,309 --> 00:57:59,144
I was chasing that kid, okay?

1389
00:57:59,186 --> 00:58:00,270
God.

1390
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:02,523
Mike, what's in your hand?

1391
00:58:02,565 --> 00:58:03,483
Oh my God, what?

1392
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:04,651
Oh my God.

1393
00:58:12,992 --> 00:58:13,952
Oh my God.

1394
00:58:13,992 --> 00:58:15,661
What is...
Oh my God.

1395
00:58:16,579 --> 00:58:18,748
Oh, that's disgusting.

1396
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:20,625
Can we
please call the police?

1397
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:21,625
Dude.

1398
00:58:21,668 --> 00:58:22,961
Dude, chill, okay?

1399
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:24,629
It's probably just...

1400
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:25,587
Give me a second.

1401
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,673
It's probably just from the...

1402
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:28,173
from the same animal

1403
00:58:28,215 --> 00:58:29,925
that the tongue and the
entrails came from, okay?

1404
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:32,594
Mike, what kind of kid
carries an eyeball around?

1405
00:58:32,637 --> 00:58:33,972
Go down and confront them.

1406
00:58:34,014 --> 00:58:35,640
I'm not going to confront
a bunch of maniacs.

1407
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:37,683
If we have both
cameras pointed on them,

1408
00:58:37,726 --> 00:58:38,893
they're not gonna do anything.

1409
00:58:38,934 --> 00:58:41,145
Uh, yes, they could
take our cameras,

1410
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:43,230
kill us, and then
God knows what.

1411
00:58:43,273 --> 00:58:44,106
Fine.

1412
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:46,276
I'll call Tony, okay?

1413
00:58:46,317 --> 00:58:48,652
And he can help us.

1414
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,697
God, this is disgusting.

1415
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,322
This is where he led you?

1416
00:58:52,364 --> 00:58:53,198
Yeah.

1417
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:00,581
Oh my.

1418
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,958
What do you want?

1419
00:59:03,001 --> 00:59:04,544
Sorry to
disturb you, ma'am.

1420
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:07,004
Is there a young boy
staying with you?

1421
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:07,963
No.

1422
00:59:08,005 --> 00:59:09,632
Are you making a movie?

1423
00:59:09,673 --> 00:59:11,092
I love movies.

1424
00:59:11,134 --> 00:59:12,635
No, we're making
a documentary.

1425
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,679
Has anything strange
happened in your room

1426
00:59:14,721 --> 00:59:15,972
since you two
started staying here?

1427
00:59:16,014 --> 00:59:17,682
No.

1428
00:59:17,724 --> 00:59:19,351
Should there have?

1429
00:59:19,391 --> 00:59:21,185
Sorry for
the inconvenience.

1430
00:59:21,226 --> 00:59:23,062
No problem.

1431
00:59:23,103 --> 00:59:25,314
Have a blessed day.

1432
00:59:25,356 --> 00:59:26,648
Joyce!

1433
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,275
Shut the darn door!

1434
00:59:30,362 --> 00:59:31,695
I don't know, man.

1435
00:59:31,737 --> 00:59:33,030
I swear the boy led me here.

1436
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:34,324
I don't...

1437
00:59:34,365 --> 00:59:35,617
Hey,
Tony, clean up the mess.

1438
00:59:35,657 --> 00:59:36,534
Coming.

1439
00:59:36,576 --> 00:59:37,369
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

1440
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:38,286
Do you have the basement key?

1441
00:59:38,327 --> 00:59:39,329
I'll get it to you tonight.

1442
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:40,579
Thank you.

1443
00:59:41,914 --> 00:59:43,208
I don't know, guys.

1444
00:59:43,248 --> 00:59:44,333
I don't know.

1445
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:45,835
Michael,

1446
00:59:45,876 --> 00:59:47,670
is everything okay?

1447
00:59:47,711 --> 00:59:49,172
Yeah, yeah,
Wallace, we're fine.

1448
00:59:49,213 --> 00:59:52,049
Listen, has anything bad
ever happened in room 440

1449
00:59:52,092 --> 00:59:53,218
in the Lenox?

1450
00:59:54,427 --> 00:59:55,804
Absolutely.

1451
00:59:55,844 --> 00:59:57,596
Kay, what was it?

1452
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:00,599
In the early
nineties, a detective

1453
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:02,768
was called in to
investigate a crime there.

1454
01:00:02,811 --> 01:00:05,855
He had a spotless 10 year record

1455
01:00:05,896 --> 01:00:07,940
and in the investigation,

1456
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:12,653
he was trying to find
out the reasoning behind

1457
01:00:12,695 --> 01:00:15,406
a French couple that was
bludgeoned to death in that room.

1458
01:00:15,447 --> 01:00:17,908
He decided to stay in the room,

1459
01:00:17,951 --> 01:00:20,744
hoping to lure back the killer,

1460
01:00:22,329 --> 01:00:24,833
but he left after three weeks
and returned to his home

1461
01:00:24,873 --> 01:00:27,251
in Culver City, where he
proceeded to put a knife

1462
01:00:27,293 --> 01:00:28,795
through his wife's
heart three times

1463
01:00:28,836 --> 01:00:31,088
while she was asleep and then

1464
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,798
gouged her eyes out.

1465
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:35,969
After that,

1466
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:37,262
he drove the kids...

1467
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:38,262
He had kids?

1468
01:00:38,304 --> 01:00:39,264
Yeah.

1469
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:40,639
He had two boys.

1470
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:41,765
How old were they?

1471
01:00:41,807 --> 01:00:43,643
Do you have a picture of them?

1472
01:00:43,684 --> 01:00:46,645
I do but it's in my book.

1473
01:00:46,688 --> 01:00:47,689
I'll go get it.

1474
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:52,735
I'm gonna use the bathroom
while he's looking for that.

1475
01:00:52,777 --> 01:00:55,822
Yeah, I'll
keep an eye on him.

1476
01:00:58,490 --> 01:00:59,701
Well.

1477
01:01:05,248 --> 01:01:06,249
Holy shit.

1478
01:01:07,708 --> 01:01:09,793
Do you know what
happened to them?

1479
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:12,796
What happened to the boys?

1480
01:01:12,838 --> 01:01:14,423
Well,

1481
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:16,884
he took them to the room, 440

1482
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,846
and proceeded to

1483
01:01:21,347 --> 01:01:23,849
put a knife through his
seven year-old's heart

1484
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:27,770
and gouge his eyes out,
just like his mother.

1485
01:01:27,811 --> 01:01:30,731
What happened to
the younger one?

1486
01:01:30,773 --> 01:01:32,817
He took off down the stairs,
down to the boiler room.

1487
01:01:32,858 --> 01:01:35,362
The father, the
detective chased him.

1488
01:01:35,402 --> 01:01:38,739
When he go to the boiler room,

1489
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:42,035
a maintenance man had
been working down there.

1490
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:44,704
And before the detective
could get his son,

1491
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:48,083
the maintenance man bashed
his head in and killed him

1492
01:01:48,123 --> 01:01:49,875
with a pipe wrench.

1493
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,795
Didn't you know this story?

1494
01:01:52,836 --> 01:01:53,838
It's a

1495
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,423
Hotel Lenox classic.

1496
01:01:57,884 --> 01:01:59,344
Thank you, Wallace.

1497
01:01:59,385 --> 01:02:00,219
Mike,

1498
01:02:01,221 --> 01:02:03,139
is everything all right?

1499
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:04,224
I gotta go.

1500
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,106
I need a minute.

1501
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:13,024
Mike, you okay?

1502
01:02:13,065 --> 01:02:14,149
Yeah, yeah.

1503
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:19,197
Stuff like that
shouldn't happen to kids.

1504
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,782
Just give me a sec.

1505
01:02:30,541 --> 01:02:32,085
Chris?

1506
01:02:33,545 --> 01:02:34,378
Chris?

1507
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,880
Whatever you do,
keep the lens up, okay?

1508
01:02:36,922 --> 01:02:39,133
Chris, open up!
Chris!

1509
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:41,052
Chris, Chris?

1510
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:42,052
- Christopher!
- Chris.

1511
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:43,053
Danni, the door's locked.

1512
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:44,389
Chris, open the door.

1513
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:45,432
Open the door, Chris.

1514
01:02:45,472 --> 01:02:46,891
Christopher, can you open it?

1515
01:02:46,932 --> 01:02:47,809
Open it, open it, open it.

1516
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:48,809
Chris?

1517
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:51,563
Are you okay?

1518
01:02:51,603 --> 01:02:53,063
Breathe, hey, hey, hey, breathe.

1519
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:54,065
Breathe, buddy.

1520
01:02:54,106 --> 01:02:54,898
Chris, Chris, look at me.

1521
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:55,817
Look me in the eye.

1522
01:02:55,858 --> 01:02:56,900
Chris, look me in the eye.

1523
01:02:56,943 --> 01:02:58,028
You are okay.

1524
01:02:58,068 --> 01:02:59,195
Chris, what
happened to your face?

1525
01:03:00,070 --> 01:03:01,322
It was the cat.

1526
01:03:01,364 --> 01:03:02,240
What do you...
Chris?

1527
01:03:02,282 --> 01:03:03,908
There's no cat in there.

1528
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:06,994
- Chris!
- No, come back.

1529
01:03:07,036 --> 01:03:07,870
Chris!

1530
01:03:08,996 --> 01:03:10,414
Chris, come back.

1531
01:03:12,083 --> 01:03:13,335
Dude,
where are you going?

1532
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:14,169
Please?

1533
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:15,420
I'm done.

1534
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:16,628
I'll give
you another $300...

1535
01:03:16,670 --> 01:03:17,463
This has nothing to
do with your money!

1536
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:18,715
Get your hand off me!

1537
01:03:18,757 --> 01:03:19,548
Chris, it's just one more day.

1538
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:21,425
Danni, I am done, no!

1539
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:22,634
Chris!

1540
01:03:22,677 --> 01:03:23,803
Danni, you've got to
help me keep him here, okay?

1541
01:03:23,844 --> 01:03:24,721
I'm trying.

1542
01:03:24,762 --> 01:03:26,806
Mike, can you put the
camera down please!

1543
01:03:26,847 --> 01:03:27,891
Shit.

1544
01:03:27,931 --> 01:03:28,891
Chris?

1545
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:30,976
Chris, please come back.

1546
01:03:31,018 --> 01:03:32,394
Come on, come on.

1547
01:03:36,148 --> 01:03:40,069
Christopher,
where are you going?

1548
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:41,403
I'm done, Danni.

1549
01:03:41,445 --> 01:03:42,947
I'm done.

1550
01:03:42,989 --> 01:03:43,947
I can't no more.

1551
01:03:43,989 --> 01:03:44,948
Chris, please.

1552
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:46,951
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

1553
01:03:46,992 --> 01:03:50,079
You can't bail on me, Chris.

1554
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:51,247
You can't on Mike either.

1555
01:03:51,289 --> 01:03:54,125
Do you know what
just happened up there?

1556
01:03:54,166 --> 01:03:56,460
I can not do this anymore.

1557
01:03:56,503 --> 01:03:57,461
Are you sure just didn't like

1558
01:03:57,503 --> 01:03:58,630
scratch yourself by accident?

1559
01:03:58,672 --> 01:04:00,548
Are you kidding me?

1560
01:04:00,590 --> 01:04:02,175
Are you kidding me?

1561
01:04:02,217 --> 01:04:03,009
Stop!

1562
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:04,259
Christopher!

1563
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:05,929
I was dragged in
there by something!

1564
01:04:05,969 --> 01:04:06,971
There is a reasonable
explanation for it.

1565
01:04:07,012 --> 01:04:08,056
Literally everything.

1566
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:09,056
- Reasonable?
- Yes!

1567
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,307
You're kidding me, Danni.

1568
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:11,558
No!

1569
01:04:11,601 --> 01:04:13,061
Maybe Mike, maybe he
gave you something,

1570
01:04:13,103 --> 01:04:14,854
maybe it was those
sleeping pills

1571
01:04:14,896 --> 01:04:15,939
and all that stuff
he keeps giving you.

1572
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,065
- Maybe it's a hallucinogen...
- This place is wrong,

1573
01:04:17,106 --> 01:04:18,565
this place is evil.

1574
01:04:18,608 --> 01:04:21,611
And if he's fucking around
with us, then he's evil, too.

1575
01:04:21,652 --> 01:04:23,362
I'm done with him!

1576
01:04:25,197 --> 01:04:26,907
Come with me.

1577
01:04:26,949 --> 01:04:27,826
I can't.

1578
01:04:27,867 --> 01:04:29,077
Come with me, I'm
leaving in one minute.

1579
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:30,662
I cannot stay here anymore.

1580
01:04:30,704 --> 01:04:33,331
I can't walk out on
my responsibilities.

1581
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,583
I can't just leave Mike and
Nic just hanging like that.

1582
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:36,458
Danni.

1583
01:04:37,376 --> 01:04:38,628
Something happened.

1584
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,547
Please come with me.

1585
01:04:42,715 --> 01:04:44,134
I can't, Chris.

1586
01:04:46,135 --> 01:04:47,137
Christopher.

1587
01:04:54,393 --> 01:04:57,563
Mike, are you serious right now?

1588
01:04:57,605 --> 01:04:59,565
Mike, I really don't feel
comfortable with this.

1589
01:04:59,606 --> 01:05:01,025
Danni, come on, please?

1590
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,527
No, Chris is out
there freaking out.

1591
01:05:02,568 --> 01:05:03,987
Like we should really...

1592
01:05:04,028 --> 01:05:04,945
we should pack our
stuff, we should go.

1593
01:05:04,987 --> 01:05:05,989
Danni, Danni please

1594
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,199
just stop for a second.

1595
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,576
We can't leave.

1596
01:05:09,617 --> 01:05:10,577
What was that?

1597
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,036
What just happened?

1598
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:13,954
I don't know, he had
a nervous breakdown.

1599
01:05:13,996 --> 01:05:16,665
I am just as freaked
out by it as you are!

1600
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:19,586
Then why can't
we just go, okay?

1601
01:05:19,626 --> 01:05:21,378
Did you see what
happened to Chris?

1602
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:23,005
We have to go, Mike.

1603
01:05:23,047 --> 01:05:24,381
Yes, I saw what
happened to him!

1604
01:05:24,423 --> 01:05:26,717
But we can't leave, Danni!

1605
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,552
I'm sorry.

1606
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:31,014
Jess is making the
bulk of our income.

1607
01:05:31,056 --> 01:05:34,934
I make very little money off
my ad revenues for the vlog.

1608
01:05:34,976 --> 01:05:37,936
And now we have a
baby on the way.

1609
01:05:37,978 --> 01:05:40,731
Do you know how
terrifying that is?

1610
01:05:40,773 --> 01:05:43,400
I need this sponsorship,
you don't understand.

1611
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:46,028
I need it because if I
can't provide for her,

1612
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:46,945
she's going to leave me.

1613
01:05:46,987 --> 01:05:49,239
Maybe not in a week,
maybe not in a month,

1614
01:05:49,282 --> 01:05:52,577
but eventually, she's going
to realize that I am useless.

1615
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:57,082
And then she's going to
leave and I cannot lose her.

1616
01:05:58,875 --> 01:05:59,708
I can't...

1617
01:06:03,253 --> 01:06:05,714
Mike, I really
wanna be here for you

1618
01:06:05,757 --> 01:06:07,675
as a friend right now, okay?

1619
01:06:07,717 --> 01:06:09,969
But I am not comfortable.

1620
01:06:11,596 --> 01:06:13,264
I know, I'm sorry.

1621
01:06:16,684 --> 01:06:17,518
Why?

1622
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:19,353
Why this?

1623
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,648
Why do we have to be here?

1624
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:27,319
I don't wanna talk about it.

1625
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:29,614
Mike.

1626
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:32,157
Mike, look at me.

1627
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:43,168
It's confusing, okay?

1628
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,044
I just...

1629
01:06:45,463 --> 01:06:49,134
Things that other people
find disgusting and

1630
01:06:49,842 --> 01:06:51,135
terrifying,

1631
01:06:53,221 --> 01:06:54,139
there's a disconnect.

1632
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:56,515
It doesn't affect me that way.

1633
01:06:57,516 --> 01:06:59,810
It feels good for me to
see those things, okay?

1634
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:01,604
And I know that sounds

1635
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:02,564
twisted but

1636
01:07:04,315 --> 01:07:05,733
that's just always how it's been

1637
01:07:05,775 --> 01:07:07,152
and even when my
parents adopted me,

1638
01:07:07,193 --> 01:07:08,278
they were terrified about it.

1639
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:10,112
You were adopted?

1640
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,742
Mike, I didn't even know that.

1641
01:07:16,661 --> 01:07:17,746
Apparently,

1642
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,791
when I was living
with my birth mom,

1643
01:07:21,833 --> 01:07:24,543
I saw something
really disturbing

1644
01:07:25,670 --> 01:07:28,088
and I don't know what it was.

1645
01:07:29,715 --> 01:07:33,177
I feel terrible
about it but look,

1646
01:07:33,219 --> 01:07:35,554
we are so close to finishing.

1647
01:07:35,597 --> 01:07:37,182
Okay, we just...

1648
01:07:37,222 --> 01:07:40,684
My followers just are expecting
us to go to the basement.

1649
01:07:40,726 --> 01:07:42,853
That's the only thing that
we need to shoot, that's it.

1650
01:07:42,896 --> 01:07:43,730
Okay?

1651
01:07:49,402 --> 01:07:50,235
Please?

1652
01:07:53,864 --> 01:07:55,074
Okay.

1653
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:57,744
Thank you so much.

1654
01:07:58,702 --> 01:07:59,579
Thank you.

1655
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:01,122
I'm sorry.

1656
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:02,374
Let's try to get
ahold of Chris.

1657
01:08:02,414 --> 01:08:03,248
Yeah.

1658
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:08,755
It's crazy to think
how many people just

1659
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,590
look across the street,
walk by everyday without

1660
01:08:10,632 --> 01:08:14,260
knowing all the shit
that went down here.

1661
01:08:16,261 --> 01:08:17,721
Yeah, it's freaky.

1662
01:08:20,307 --> 01:08:23,353
Hey, I'm really sorry
you got so scared.

1663
01:08:23,395 --> 01:08:25,188
What happened was not cool.

1664
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:26,897
It's okay, it's...

1665
01:08:26,939 --> 01:08:28,148
I mean,

1666
01:08:28,942 --> 01:08:32,153
there's a reason for
everything, right?

1667
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,407
We just gotta figure
out what it was.

1668
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:38,242
Oh, Jesus.

1669
01:08:38,283 --> 01:08:41,871
Looks like somebody's
a big fan of you.

1670
01:08:41,912 --> 01:08:43,747
Dude, get out of here!

1671
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:45,792
Dude, bye.

1672
01:08:49,962 --> 01:08:51,505
Wow, linger much.

1673
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:57,761
Christopher still
not texting you back?

1674
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:58,930
No.

1675
01:08:58,971 --> 01:09:00,264
Danni, camera.

1676
01:09:00,305 --> 01:09:02,141
Come on, come on, come on.

1677
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:04,936
Mike.

1678
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:09,190
Is that the old lady
from the room we went to?

1679
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:10,108
Oh my God.

1680
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:11,775
Her friend must have
jumped or something.

1681
01:09:11,818 --> 01:09:12,652
Oh my God.

1682
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:15,822
Why would she do this?

1683
01:09:17,198 --> 01:09:19,284
This is different, I...

1684
01:09:20,702 --> 01:09:22,704
Different how?

1685
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:27,834
It's not removed.

1686
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:29,210
It's not like it
is in a picture.

1687
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:33,381
I don't know, it's
just different, okay?

1688
01:09:35,341 --> 01:09:36,967
Mike,
Mike, we should go.

1689
01:09:37,010 --> 01:09:37,802
Why?

1690
01:09:37,844 --> 01:09:38,636
Just, come on.

1691
01:09:38,677 --> 01:09:40,305
Just walk.

1692
01:09:40,346 --> 01:09:42,849
Guys, get your
camera out of here.

1693
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,099
Don't look
back, don't look back,

1694
01:09:44,141 --> 01:09:44,934
don't look back.

1695
01:09:44,975 --> 01:09:46,518
Please.

1696
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,811
Who's following us?

1697
01:09:47,854 --> 01:09:51,524
I don't
know, I don't know.

1698
01:09:51,565 --> 01:09:53,400
I don't see anybody.

1699
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,528
Shit, shit.

1700
01:09:55,569 --> 01:09:56,820
Come on, come on, come on!

1701
01:10:01,242 --> 01:10:02,327
Come on, come on,
come on, Danni.

1702
01:10:10,001 --> 01:10:11,836
Who was that?

1703
01:10:11,877 --> 01:10:12,753
What are you doing?

1704
01:10:12,796 --> 01:10:15,298
Throwing him off.

1705
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,007
Mike, hurry.

1706
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:20,220
There's
the other elevator.

1707
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:24,682
Shit!

1708
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:27,560
Why are we running?

1709
01:10:27,601 --> 01:10:29,520
Because he's
clearly after us, Mike.

1710
01:10:29,561 --> 01:10:30,979
I think he
just wants to scare us.

1711
01:10:31,021 --> 01:10:32,023
Oh fine, if you
wanna hang back and chit chat,

1712
01:10:32,064 --> 01:10:34,317
just be my guest.

1713
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,527
Where are we?

1714
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:37,237
These are
the low income floors.

1715
01:10:37,278 --> 01:10:38,195
Which way do we go?

1716
01:10:38,238 --> 01:10:39,030
I don't know.

1717
01:10:39,072 --> 01:10:39,989
That way, that way.

1718
01:10:42,408 --> 01:10:44,536
They made me do this.

1719
01:10:47,454 --> 01:10:48,414
Wait, are you okay?

1720
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:49,416
I'm fine, I'm fine.

1721
01:10:49,457 --> 01:10:50,250
Keep going.

1722
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:51,292
Mike, come on!

1723
01:10:53,336 --> 01:10:54,295
How do we get out of here?

1724
01:10:54,337 --> 01:10:56,256
I don't know.

1725
01:10:58,048 --> 01:11:00,551
Danni, Danni, Danni, the door.

1726
01:11:01,677 --> 01:11:02,554
Did you see that?

1727
01:11:02,595 --> 01:11:03,387
See what?

1728
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:04,847
Mike, come on.

1729
01:11:04,889 --> 01:11:05,765
Okay.

1730
01:11:05,806 --> 01:11:08,393
Going down.

1731
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:09,978
Oh shit.

1732
01:11:15,315 --> 01:11:16,568
Where's the stairs?

1733
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:17,652
It's gotta be
somewhere around here.

1734
01:11:24,074 --> 01:11:26,036
Go, go, go, go, go.

1735
01:11:26,077 --> 01:11:27,619
Move, move!

1736
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:34,085
Mike, where's the key?

1737
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:35,337
I dropped the
key, I dropped the key.

1738
01:11:35,377 --> 01:11:36,420
Please go get it.

1739
01:11:38,797 --> 01:11:39,715
Thank you.

1740
01:11:39,757 --> 01:11:40,966
No, no, no, no.

1741
01:11:41,885 --> 01:11:43,595
Please, please.

1742
01:11:43,636 --> 01:11:44,888
Where's the key?

1743
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:46,431
Please.

1744
01:11:46,472 --> 01:11:47,431
Christopher!

1745
01:11:54,855 --> 01:11:57,399
Holy shit, was
that the guy from the alley?

1746
01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:58,443
The drug dealer?

1747
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:00,653
Oh, Chris.

1748
01:12:02,447 --> 01:12:04,615
I wanna go home please.

1749
01:12:06,408 --> 01:12:07,451
Chris,
thank you so much.

1750
01:12:07,493 --> 01:12:09,411
Hey, no one came back for you.

1751
01:12:09,453 --> 01:12:10,954
He ran down the fire escape.

1752
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:12,957
You guys okay?

1753
01:12:12,998 --> 01:12:15,793
No, far from it.

1754
01:12:15,835 --> 01:12:17,545
I'll walk you out.

1755
01:12:17,587 --> 01:12:18,505
You coming?

1756
01:12:21,341 --> 01:12:22,133
Mike, come with us.

1757
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:23,009
Please come...

1758
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,886
I can't, I can't.
Nic's here and the equipment.

1759
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:25,720
I can't leave.

1760
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:26,679
Guys, guys.

1761
01:12:31,016 --> 01:12:32,519
Fuck.

1762
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:34,062
God damnit.

1763
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,859
Nic?

1764
01:12:40,902 --> 01:12:42,654
Nic, Nic, oh my God.

1765
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:44,488
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1766
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:45,657
Nic, come on.

1767
01:12:48,451 --> 01:12:49,327
Nic, Nic, Nic, come on.

1768
01:12:49,368 --> 01:12:50,161
Come on, come on.

1769
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:51,287
Come on.

1770
01:12:51,328 --> 01:12:52,121
Oh my God, Nic.

1771
01:12:52,162 --> 01:12:53,163
What's wrong?

1772
01:12:53,206 --> 01:12:53,998
What's wrong?

1773
01:12:54,039 --> 01:12:55,125
Look at me please?

1774
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,376
Bad thoughts.

1775
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:03,841
Okay, okay.

1776
01:13:03,882 --> 01:13:04,675
Come here.

1777
01:13:04,717 --> 01:13:05,510
Come here.

1778
01:13:05,551 --> 01:13:06,385
No, no, no, no.

1779
01:13:11,181 --> 01:13:12,891
Ms. Eply?

1780
01:13:12,934 --> 01:13:14,394
It's about Nic.

1781
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:17,396
Jesus, what happened?

1782
01:13:18,981 --> 01:13:21,984
Hi, Mrs. Eply, thank
you so much for coming.

1783
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:23,485
I'm sorry, okay?

1784
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:24,487
I don't know what
happened to her.

1785
01:13:24,529 --> 01:13:26,031
Honey, honey, what's wrong?

1786
01:13:26,072 --> 01:13:27,574
Please talk to us.

1787
01:13:29,492 --> 01:13:30,284
Will you drive please?

1788
01:13:30,326 --> 01:13:31,953
I wanna sit in
the back with her.

1789
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:33,121
I'm so sorry.

1790
01:13:33,162 --> 01:13:35,539
I'm gonna be calling you!

1791
01:13:35,582 --> 01:13:38,418
Thanks for bringing her down.

1792
01:14:09,783 --> 01:14:10,700
Hi.

1793
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:11,576
Jess.

1794
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:15,538
Are you okay?

1795
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:17,582
Jess, why are you crying?

1796
01:14:17,623 --> 01:14:20,001
'Cause I had a dream.

1797
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:21,627
It was a bad dream.

1798
01:14:23,796 --> 01:14:26,048
I feel like you're in
danger and I need you

1799
01:14:26,091 --> 01:14:27,676
to come home, okay?

1800
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:29,802
Jess, I'm sorry.

1801
01:14:29,844 --> 01:14:30,804
I can't come home yet.

1802
01:14:30,845 --> 01:14:31,637
Okay?

1803
01:14:31,680 --> 01:14:32,847
I just...

1804
01:14:32,889 --> 01:14:33,931
There are things that
I have to do here.

1805
01:14:33,972 --> 01:14:35,766
What do you have to do?

1806
01:14:35,809 --> 01:14:38,269
I need you here with me.

1807
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,895
And I...

1808
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:40,855
I'm scared.

1809
01:14:42,106 --> 01:14:43,942
Jess, come on, okay?

1810
01:14:43,983 --> 01:14:45,193
Please.

1811
01:14:45,234 --> 01:14:46,152
You know we need the
money and I can't.

1812
01:14:46,194 --> 01:14:49,030
I can work overtime
until I can't anymore.

1813
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:51,533
I just need you to come home.

1814
01:14:51,573 --> 01:14:52,408
Stop!

1815
01:14:53,326 --> 01:14:56,496
Jess, you should never ever
have to work overtime again

1816
01:14:56,537 --> 01:14:59,832
and I can finish here, I just...

1817
01:14:59,873 --> 01:15:02,126
Mike, are you kidding?

1818
01:15:02,167 --> 01:15:05,963
This is dangerous and I
know that you know it too

1819
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:08,717
so can you just come home?

1820
01:15:08,757 --> 01:15:10,010
I don't know.

1821
01:15:10,969 --> 01:15:14,681
I think I made a mistake
and I have to finish.

1822
01:15:14,722 --> 01:15:18,309
Okay, and then I'll
be home for you, okay?

1823
01:15:18,350 --> 01:15:19,309
I swear.

1824
01:15:19,351 --> 01:15:21,604
But I can't leave yet.

1825
01:15:21,645 --> 01:15:23,063
Why?

1826
01:15:23,105 --> 01:15:24,273
Jess.

1827
01:15:24,314 --> 01:15:25,399
Come on.

1828
01:15:25,442 --> 01:15:26,234
Why do you have to finish it?

1829
01:15:26,275 --> 01:15:27,234
You answer me please.

1830
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:28,194
I can't...

1831
01:15:28,235 --> 01:15:29,820
Just answer me, why do
you have to finish it?

1832
01:15:29,863 --> 01:15:32,323
You can't come home to your...

1833
01:15:32,364 --> 01:15:34,617
To your baby, are you kidding?

1834
01:15:34,658 --> 01:15:36,536
Jess, I love you most, okay?

1835
01:15:36,578 --> 01:15:37,704
No, Mike.

1836
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,127
Okay, everybody.

1837
01:17:49,168 --> 01:17:50,795
Live feed time.

1838
01:17:50,837 --> 01:17:52,881
Making the final descent.

1839
01:17:54,966 --> 01:17:56,468
I hope you can
see the feed okay.

1840
01:17:56,509 --> 01:17:57,676
It's spotty.

1841
01:18:00,262 --> 01:18:03,432
Keep going, Mike, keep going.

1842
01:18:03,475 --> 01:18:05,769
Just 330 more subscribers.

1843
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:07,270
Just 330 more subscribers.

1844
01:18:11,899 --> 01:18:12,692
Wallace?

1845
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:13,526
Michael.

1846
01:18:13,568 --> 01:18:14,360
Oh God, Michael.

1847
01:18:14,402 --> 01:18:15,487
Where are you now?

1848
01:18:15,528 --> 01:18:18,365
I'm heading towards
the hotel basement, why?

1849
01:18:18,405 --> 01:18:20,699
I beg
you, please get out of there.

1850
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:23,119
I found out what happened
to the little boy

1851
01:18:23,161 --> 01:18:24,871
who escaped his
father, the detective.

1852
01:18:24,912 --> 01:18:27,748
He's the one
behind all this, isn't he?

1853
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:29,793
Behind scaring us
the last few nights.

1854
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,126
No!

1855
01:18:31,168 --> 01:18:31,961
No, Michael.

1856
01:18:32,002 --> 01:18:33,170
What?

1857
01:18:33,212 --> 01:18:34,421
The boy was you.

1858
01:18:34,463 --> 01:18:35,590
Wallace,
what did you say?

1859
01:18:35,631 --> 01:18:38,342
The little
was you.

1860
01:18:45,391 --> 01:18:48,478
Only 330
more subscribers.

1861
01:19:04,034 --> 01:19:06,787
All right, this looks familiar.

1862
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,844
Get in there.

1863
01:19:22,177 --> 01:19:23,012
Got it.

1864
01:19:29,853 --> 01:19:33,523
Part of me was hoping
that wouldn't work.

1865
01:19:52,458 --> 01:19:54,501
This does not smell good.

1866
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:03,385
Oh, there are the mannequins
that we saw on the drone.

1867
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:08,932
Okay.

1868
01:20:10,935 --> 01:20:13,188
Guess we're going this way.

1869
01:20:17,984 --> 01:20:19,486
What was that?

1870
01:20:19,527 --> 01:20:22,489
Oh, there's nothing
in there, okay.

1871
01:20:31,956 --> 01:20:32,832
Okay, okay.

1872
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:36,168
All right.

1873
01:20:47,971 --> 01:20:48,889
What the hell?

1874
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:51,266
Keep going, Mike.

1875
01:20:51,309 --> 01:20:54,186
Keep going, keep
going, keep going.

1876
01:20:55,229 --> 01:20:56,980
What is that?

1877
01:21:00,694 --> 01:21:04,114
Oh man, the smell is
way worse down here.

1878
01:21:06,615 --> 01:21:07,533
The boiler.

1879
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:11,203
Okay.

1880
01:21:13,664 --> 01:21:15,625
Here, kitty kitty.

1881
01:21:15,667 --> 01:21:17,377
Here, kitty kitty.

1882
01:21:18,293 --> 01:21:19,336
What?

1883
01:21:19,378 --> 01:21:20,963
No way.

1884
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:22,048
No way.

1885
01:21:23,048 --> 01:21:24,341
Is that our drone?

1886
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:27,345
What the hell?

1887
01:21:27,386 --> 01:21:29,389
Oh, it's right...

1888
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:32,016
It's right above the vent
where Meghan Kim was.

1889
01:21:34,728 --> 01:21:35,895
Who's there?

1890
01:21:36,979 --> 01:21:37,980
Who's there?

1891
01:21:46,948 --> 01:21:47,949
Hello?

1892
01:21:53,203 --> 01:21:54,956
Oh my God, oh God.

1893
01:21:54,997 --> 01:21:56,206
Oh God.

1894
01:21:58,376 --> 01:21:59,543
Who is that?

1895
01:22:01,421 --> 01:22:02,255
Hello?

1896
01:22:05,132 --> 01:22:08,470
Who turned that light on?
What was that?

1897
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:16,269
Who turned that light on?

1898
01:22:31,201 --> 01:22:35,622
If this is some sick prank,
you're doing a great job.

1899
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:41,127
What the fuck?

1900
01:22:45,547 --> 01:22:46,382
Hey!

1901
01:22:48,259 --> 01:22:49,386
I know somebody's here!

1902
01:22:49,426 --> 01:22:50,469
Who did this?

1903
01:23:01,980 --> 01:23:02,773
Shit.

1904
01:23:02,815 --> 01:23:04,108
Shit, shit.

1905
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:09,447
No way.

1906
01:23:09,488 --> 01:23:10,781
No way, no way, no way.

1907
01:23:13,409 --> 01:23:15,036
Who's watching me?

1908
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:18,122
Is that?

1909
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:22,168
Is that Tony's notebook?

1910
01:23:24,128 --> 01:23:26,131
Why is this page marked?

1911
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:30,176
Oh, what the fuck?

1912
01:23:30,217 --> 01:23:31,051
No way.

1913
01:23:31,094 --> 01:23:32,177
No, no, no, no.

1914
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:33,471
No way.

1915
01:23:33,512 --> 01:23:35,765
No, this can't be right.

1916
01:23:38,184 --> 01:23:39,019
Oh, God!

1917
01:23:40,353 --> 01:23:42,021
Who's there?

1918
01:23:42,063 --> 01:23:43,230
What the fuck?

1919
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,192
Who is that?

1920
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:54,033
Hey!

1921
01:23:55,159 --> 01:23:56,077
Who's there?

1922
01:23:56,118 --> 01:23:57,619
God damnit.

1923
01:23:57,662 --> 01:23:59,079
Oh, God.

1924
01:23:59,122 --> 01:24:01,082
Okay, okay, okay.

1925
01:24:01,123 --> 01:24:02,751
I'm not afraid of you!

1926
01:24:04,586 --> 01:24:05,753
Come out here!

1927
01:24:12,676 --> 01:24:13,594
Shit, shit.

1928
01:24:18,766 --> 01:24:19,600
Okay.

1929
01:24:37,702 --> 01:24:39,119
Oh God, oh God.

1930
01:24:53,051 --> 01:24:53,843
I'm sorry!

1931
01:24:53,885 --> 01:24:55,220
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1932
01:24:55,261 --> 01:24:57,222
Please leave me alone.

1933
01:25:06,271 --> 01:25:07,731
Get out of the way!

1934
01:25:07,774 --> 01:25:09,275
No
one's allowed in here.

1935
01:25:09,317 --> 01:25:10,150
Hey!

1936
01:25:51,484 --> 01:25:52,485
Hey, guys.

1937
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:54,820
Mike here.

1938
01:25:56,905 --> 01:25:59,908
I'm sorry about the late post.

1939
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:03,788
I know some of you have
been worried about me.

1940
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:10,628
I'm streaming this live so I
can answer your questions but

1941
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:14,673
before I get to that, I
wanted to show you this.

1942
01:26:16,967 --> 01:26:19,804
It seems I broke my hand.

1943
01:26:19,845 --> 01:26:21,180
In three places.

1944
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:27,896
The police were
questioning me for hours

1945
01:26:28,854 --> 01:26:29,688
about

1946
01:26:31,608 --> 01:26:33,943
the body in the boiler room.

1947
01:26:44,412 --> 01:26:46,831
I reached 50,000 subscribers,

1948
01:26:47,957 --> 01:26:49,959
which I really, really

1949
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:52,212
appreciate you guys for.

1950
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:59,510
I've been trying to reach Chris,

1951
01:26:59,551 --> 01:27:01,261
and Nic, and Danni

1952
01:27:02,764 --> 01:27:04,682
but they don't respond.

1953
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:08,395
I don't blame them.

1954
01:27:10,270 --> 01:27:12,606
I just, I hope they're okay.

1955
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:18,362
And I haven't talked
to Jess either, but

1956
01:27:18,404 --> 01:27:19,405
I just, I...

1957
01:27:23,283 --> 01:27:26,704
I just don't know what
to say to her and...

1958
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,793
I had a lot of time to think.

1959
01:27:33,670 --> 01:27:34,837
A lot of time.

1960
01:27:38,632 --> 01:27:40,551
And I think the best
decision right now

1961
01:27:40,592 --> 01:27:43,304
is to take a sabbatical
from the vlog.

1962
01:27:43,345 --> 01:27:44,805
I'm trying to

1963
01:27:44,847 --> 01:27:47,641
put this weekend behind me,

1964
01:27:47,684 --> 01:27:49,269
think about things.

1965
01:27:52,104 --> 01:27:52,938
I've

1966
01:27:57,569 --> 01:28:00,363
cut together some stuff from

1967
01:28:00,404 --> 01:28:02,032
our trip this weekend.

1968
01:28:06,536 --> 01:28:08,288
When I was in that basement,

1969
01:28:08,328 --> 01:28:09,371
I was

1970
01:28:10,414 --> 01:28:13,335
so alone and scared and I
just kept thinking about

1971
01:28:13,376 --> 01:28:17,838
how alone and scared
Meghan Kim must have been.

1972
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:19,507
I'm sorry, this footage is crap.

1973
01:28:19,548 --> 01:28:23,094
Nic would have done a much
better job editing it.

1974
01:28:23,136 --> 01:28:24,346
But I...

1975
01:28:26,389 --> 01:28:29,893
I decided to do a short
documentary like this

1976
01:28:29,934 --> 01:28:33,396
on the homeless
issue in downtown.

1977
01:28:33,438 --> 01:28:35,023
Just, I need to try

1978
01:28:36,065 --> 01:28:40,987
and put something positive out
into the world for a change.

1979
01:28:43,655 --> 01:28:44,698
I need to try

1980
01:28:46,408 --> 01:28:50,871
to come to terms with what I
know about my birth father.

1981
01:28:53,457 --> 01:28:56,835
Which means I might
lose the sponsorship.

1982
01:28:59,171 --> 01:29:01,006
But if I do, I mean,

1983
01:29:03,134 --> 01:29:03,967
so be it.

1984
01:29:07,846 --> 01:29:08,889
Come on, turn on.

1985
01:29:08,931 --> 01:29:10,349
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1986
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:15,146
Oh fuck, fuck.

1987
01:29:18,149 --> 01:29:19,150
Jess!

1988
01:29:19,192 --> 01:29:19,984
Jess, is that you?

1989
01:29:58,814 --> 01:30:00,399
Yo, bitches.

1990
01:30:00,442 --> 01:30:01,568
Terrible Tyler here.

1991
01:30:01,609 --> 01:30:04,112
And today, I am stoked to find

1992
01:30:05,238 --> 01:30:07,407
DropTheMike's actual crib,

1993
01:30:09,158 --> 01:30:11,994
where his fiance
was decapitated.

1994
01:30:12,037 --> 01:30:13,204
Sick!

1995
01:30:13,246 --> 01:30:16,791
And what's even sicker is that
DropTheMike totally bolted.

1996
01:30:16,832 --> 01:30:19,043
Cops can't find him anywhere.

1997
01:30:19,085 --> 01:30:20,127
How epic is that?

1998
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:23,465
Dude,
it says do not cross.

1999
01:30:23,506 --> 01:30:24,341
Dude.

2000
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:26,967
Not anymore.

2001
01:30:28,595 --> 01:30:30,555
Tune in tonight where
I try to find out

2002
01:30:30,596 --> 01:30:33,182
what happened to DropTheMic and

2003
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,479
I'll show you how I got
this awesome artifact.

2004
01:30:38,520 --> 01:30:40,230
Like, comment,

2005
01:30:40,273 --> 01:30:42,025
and subscribe to my
channel, bitches.

2006
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:44,778
I post new videos every Monday.

2007
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:45,653
Peace!

2008
