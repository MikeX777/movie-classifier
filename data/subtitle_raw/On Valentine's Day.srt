1
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,421
-Merry Christmas, Elizabeth.
-Merry Christmas, girls.

2
00:01:34,616 --> 00:01:35,747
Merry Christmas.

3
00:01:36,966 --> 00:01:40,143
This will never wear out on you,
Mr. Speak.

4
00:01:40,187 --> 00:01:43,233
Hi, Frankie.
Mims, I'll be right with you.

5
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:49,979
Merry Christmas, sir.

6
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:51,807
Thank you, Frankie.
Merry Christmas.

7
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,548
Hello, Frank.
Hello, honey.

8
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,115
Hello, honey.

9
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:01,077
I brought you some food
from the restaurant.

10
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,905
Oh, thank you, darling.

11
00:02:05,516 --> 00:02:07,779
All right, Mims.
Have a nice Christmas.

12
00:02:07,823 --> 00:02:10,347
A Merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Horace.

13
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,483
So, what do you think,
Mr. Speak?

14
00:02:37,809 --> 00:02:39,376
Come in.

15
00:02:41,857 --> 00:02:43,250
Hello, Mary.

16
00:02:43,293 --> 00:02:45,774
Hello, Bessie.

17
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:47,341
Merry Christmas.

18
00:02:47,384 --> 00:02:49,212
Merry Christmas to you.

19
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,953
I brought you a present

20
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:52,650
and I brought the baby
a present.

21
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:55,131
Oh, thank you.

22
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,656
There's a present for you, too,
under the Christmas tree.

23
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,442
Sit down and visit, Bessie.

24
00:03:02,399 --> 00:03:05,489
I'm so glad you came by.

25
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:07,099
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

26
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:10,233
I'm here all alone
in this big, old rooming house.

27
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:12,322
Horace is workin' late
at the tailorin' shop,

28
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:14,629
and then, he's workin' tonight
at Mr. Dixon's store

29
00:03:14,672 --> 00:03:16,065
to earn a little extra money,

30
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,546
so I'm all alone.

31
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:20,548
Well, you have a piece of candy,
Bessie.

32
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,637
I don't mind if I do.

33
00:03:23,812 --> 00:03:26,249
Hello, Mr. George.

34
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:27,685
Is Horace here?

35
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:30,384
No, sir.
He's still at the store.

36
00:03:30,427 --> 00:03:31,820
What time do you expect him?

37
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,735
Not for a while yet.

38
00:03:33,778 --> 00:03:35,258
You tell him
I was askin' for him.

39
00:03:35,302 --> 00:03:37,042
-Yes, sir.
-Merry Christmas.

40
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,044
Merry Christmas.

41
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,619
Mr. George Tyler's off again,
Mama says.

42
00:03:48,663 --> 00:03:49,968
Are you scared of him?

43
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:53,276
No. He looks harmless enough
to me, poor thing.

44
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,453
Mama says he's gonna kill
someone if they aren't careful.

45
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:59,021
She says he's rich
and kin to everybody in town,

46
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,501
and that's why everybody
looks the other way

47
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,198
no matter how he acts.

48
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,940
He's not kin to me.
Is he kin to you?

49
00:04:04,983 --> 00:04:09,205
No. He's kin to Horace,
but only by marriage.

50
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:12,295
This is the first Christmas

51
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,384
I've spent away
from Mama and Papa, Bessie.

52
00:04:14,428 --> 00:04:15,690
Is that so?

53
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,648
Yes.

54
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,737
Last Christmas was, I think,

55
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:22,305
the most unhappy one
I'll ever know.

56
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,265
At least, I hope I'll never know
one more unhappy.

57
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,354
Why was it so unhappy?

58
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,094
Well...

59
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:32,141
Papa, by then,

60
00:04:32,184 --> 00:04:35,318
was so determined
that I wasn't to marry,

61
00:04:35,362 --> 00:04:38,278
and was so unpleasant
and in such a bad temper

62
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:39,975
anytime Horace came
near the house.

63
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:42,412
I finally asked Horace
not to come anymore.

64
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:45,502
And that's when I started
slippin' around

65
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:47,852
and meetin' Horace
at the ice cream parlor

66
00:04:47,896 --> 00:04:50,246
and the picture show.

67
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,161
Of course, Mama always
found out about it

68
00:04:52,204 --> 00:04:54,119
every time I did
something like that,

69
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,948
since she has spies
all over this town.

70
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,473
Mrs. Cookenboo was her main spy,

71
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,693
but she had her lieutenants
all around.

72
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:07,350
They sent me to Galveston
in the summer to visit my aunts.

73
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:08,743
Mama and Papa kept hoping

74
00:05:08,786 --> 00:05:10,440
if they could get me away
long enough,

75
00:05:10,484 --> 00:05:13,356
I would meet someone else
and forget Horace.

76
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,054
And then, Allie Douglas
married Hector.

77
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,143
And she was almost
my closest friend.

78
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:20,668
Allie Douglas?
Is that Allie Dockery?

79
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:22,191
She was Allie Dockery.

80
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:24,411
She's Allie Douglas
now that she's married.

81
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:26,587
-I know her.
-Of course you do.

82
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,807
-Her papa's state senator.
-Yes.

83
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:35,030
So, Horace and I
decided to run away and marry.

84
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:39,077
The day before we were to elope,
Papa came early.

85
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:41,776
And he was all nervous
and excited.

86
00:05:41,819 --> 00:05:44,169
Well, I almost had
a heart failure.

87
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,084
But it wasn't about my elopin'.

88
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:49,000
He was upset because a sheriff
had come to him

89
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,872
about the hangin' of that man

90
00:05:50,915 --> 00:05:54,266
that robbed Mr. Azerley's
grocery store and killed him.

91
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:56,399
Do you think Allie Dockery
is pretty?

92
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:58,445
Yes, I do.

93
00:05:58,488 --> 00:05:59,924
Do you think she's beautiful?

94
00:05:59,968 --> 00:06:03,928
Yes, I do.
I think she's beautiful.

95
00:06:03,972 --> 00:06:07,279
Anyway, as much as I am
against public hangin',

96
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,759
I was glad, let me tell you,

97
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,718
that he had this on his mind
that night

98
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:12,763
and wouldn't be payin'
any attention to me.

99
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:13,764
Goodnight, Papa.

100
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:14,939
As the night grew nearer,

101
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:17,681
I began to get waves
of almost nausea,

102
00:06:17,725 --> 00:06:20,510
and I swear I had a fever.

103
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:22,294
I went to bed as soon
as I could,

104
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:24,558
but I couldn't sleep at all.

105
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,778
I began to think
of Clark Ferguson then.

106
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,172
She was the first friend I had
that died.

107
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:32,174
Do you remember Clarkie?

108
00:06:32,217 --> 00:06:33,697
-No.
-Sure you do.

109
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,307
No, ma'am.

110
00:06:35,351 --> 00:06:37,658
Well, I don't see how anybody
in this world that knew her

111
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,963
could forget her.

112
00:06:39,007 --> 00:06:40,574
But I never knew her.

113
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:42,967
Oh, you were bound to.
You've just forgotten is all.

114
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:47,319
Anyway, I heard
the courthouse clock strike 11,

115
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:51,585
and I began
to think of Clarkie then.

116
00:06:51,628 --> 00:06:54,414
So pretty and sweet,
dyin' at 16,

117
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:57,155
and here I was,

118
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,855
about to defy my parents
and run off and marry.

119
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:03,858
And I began to cry.

120
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:06,382
And I was sobbin' so...

121
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,255
...that I was afraid
I would wake my Mama and Papa

122
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:12,257
or my brother.

123
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,564
So, I got out of my bed
and I opened the window,

124
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:17,480
and I looked out at the night,
and I thought,

125
00:07:17,524 --> 00:07:19,526
"I'll never be lookin'
out this window again any more

126
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:21,005
after tonight.

127
00:07:22,137 --> 00:07:23,747
I'll never be in this house
anymore

128
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,836
until after I'm married."

129
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,795
What's your papa's name?

130
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,972
Vaughn. Henry Vaughn.

131
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:35,977
My mother's name is Mary.

132
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,587
Maybe that's why
you call me Mary.

133
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:41,417
You get my first name
mixed up with my mama's.

134
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,158
When do you open the presents
at your house?

135
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:44,638
In the mornin'.

136
00:07:44,681 --> 00:07:47,858
That's when we open them
at my mama's and papa's, too.

137
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:55,605
-It's a lovely supper, Charity.
-Thank you.

138
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,478
-Papa.
-Yes, sir?

139
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:00,784
May I-- may I borrow
the car tonight?

140
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:03,526
-What for?
-I wanna visit some friends.

141
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,310
-No.
-Papa, please.

142
00:08:05,354 --> 00:08:08,357
No, Brother, I want you home
on Christmas Eve.

143
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,012
Mama.

144
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:14,494
No, Brother.
You heard your papa.

145
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,585
We got a letter
from Laura and Dora.

146
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:21,457
And they seem well and happy.

147
00:08:22,937 --> 00:08:25,417
Did Clarkie Ferguson
have black hair?

148
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:27,071
-Yes.
-And curls?

149
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,334
-Yes.
-Then I knew her.

150
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,511
Of course you did.

151
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,515
Mr. George is back.

152
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,221
Mr. George?

153
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:50,181
Can you tell me
how to get to town? I've forgot.

154
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:53,881
Why yes, sir. You turn right.

155
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:01,149
Where is the train bridge?

156
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:04,413
Well, that's to your left.

157
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,983
That's where the town
used to be.

158
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:10,898
Yes, I've heard that.

159
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,639
Before your time and mine.

160
00:09:12,682 --> 00:09:14,162
Yes, sir.

161
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,649
I heard that you and Horace
eloped.

162
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,738
Yes, sir.

163
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:29,873
And your mama and papa
still haven't forgiven you?

164
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:30,613
No, sir.

165
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,921
I hear you slipped off
to Allie and Hector's house

166
00:09:33,964 --> 00:09:34,835
for the wedding.

167
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,663
Yes, sir.

168
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:39,927
And I heard the Methodist
preacher refused to marry you

169
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,886
out of friendship to Mr. Vaughn,
your father.

170
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,367
You and Horace then asked
the Baptist preacher

171
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,891
to marry you, and he agreed.

172
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:52,766
But first, before the ceremony,
he said he wouldn't perform it

173
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:54,942
unless you called your father

174
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,422
and told him
what you were about to do.

175
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,511
And you phoned him.

176
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,339
And he begged you not to do it.

177
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,603
He said you'd live to regret it.

178
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:09,043
Well, Papa,
I'm sorry you feel that way.

179
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,263
Goodbye.

180
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,746
You married on Valentine's Day.

181
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,008
Yes, sir.

182
00:10:18,052 --> 00:10:21,577
At 1:00 in the afternoon
on Valentine's Day.

183
00:10:23,144 --> 00:10:24,319
I turn to the right?

184
00:10:24,362 --> 00:10:26,103
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,279
How many blocks to town?

186
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:30,151
Two and a half.

187
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,951
Do, uh-- do you have the time,
kind sir?

188
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,561
Headin' toward 5:00, Bobby.

189
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,912
Hey, do you want
a drink of whiskey?

190
00:10:51,955 --> 00:10:53,348
I don't drink.

191
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,002
Uh, do you mind if I have one?

192
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:57,352
No.

193
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,570
Well, here's to your health.

194
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,977
Mr. George Tyler
is on the phone.

195
00:11:14,021 --> 00:11:15,849
He wants to know if you remember
the name of the man

196
00:11:15,892 --> 00:11:18,155
who killed Mr. Buck Davis.

197
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:20,636
Les Freeman-Constable.

198
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,378
He also wanted to know
if he was black or white.

199
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:26,729
I said he was white,
but he wanted me to ask you.

200
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:28,905
Well, tell him
I said he was white.

201
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:30,777
Yes, sir.

202
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,387
He also said for me to tell you

203
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:35,085
that he thought you were
the conscience of the whole town

204
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,739
as well as the county.

205
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:42,049
Well, tell him I think
he's very kind to think so.

I'm sorry to disturb you
at this time of the night,

212
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,165
but I'm lookin' for my mother.

213
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:14,864
Oh, Mr. Bobby, she's gone
to your brother's in Bay City.

214
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,518
Is it Christmas?

215
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:17,649
Christmas Eve.

216
00:12:17,693 --> 00:12:19,869
-Uh-huh. Christmas Eve?
-Yes.

217
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,525
What's the year, please?

218
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:24,961

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,052
-Are we at war?
-Yes.

He's drunk.

222
00:12:44,024 --> 00:12:45,808
Horace?

223
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,115
-Hmm?
-Are you goin' home?

224
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,726
Oh, yes. I sure am, Miss Ruth.

225
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,686
-I'll walk with you.
-Mmm, all right.

226
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,123
Are you busy?

227
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:58,603
All day and night people
were spendin' money

228
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:00,127
like it was goin' out of style.

229
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,302
I know.

230
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,611
-Hello, Cousin George.
-Hello, Horace.

231
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:11,834
-Merry Christmas, Cousin George.
-Merry Christmas.

232
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:14,968
Well, I am glad

233
00:13:15,011 --> 00:13:17,492
that I don't have to clerk
in a store every day.

234
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:18,885
-It's a godsend.
-Yeah.

235
00:13:18,928 --> 00:13:20,190
I don't know that I could
stand it much longer.

236
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:21,583
How do you stand it, Horace?

237
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,498
Oh, I don't mind it,
especially when we're busy.

238
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,065
When it's quiet
and there's no business,

239
00:13:25,108 --> 00:13:26,675
I don't care for it too much.

240
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:29,678
Well, my feet are killin' me
from standing all these hours.

241
00:13:29,721 --> 00:13:31,114
Don't your feet hurt you?

242
00:13:31,158 --> 00:13:32,899
No, not too much.

243
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:36,467
I'm gonna soak mine in hot water
before I go to bed tonight.

244
00:13:36,511 --> 00:13:40,123
Oh, um, did Elizabeth hear
from her mother and father?

245
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:42,082
No, not unless she heard
this evening.

246
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,824
Oh, I was so hopin'
that the spirit of Christmas

247
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:47,348
would embrace them
and they would forgive you both.

248
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,437
I saw Miss Vaughn uptown
this afternoon

249
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,222
and I almost took it upon myself
to tell her

250
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:54,311
that I thought
since it was Christmas,

251
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:57,271
surely she and Mr. Vaughn
could find it in their hearts

252
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:59,447
to forget and forgive
their daughter,

253
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,886
but then I remembered
that Miss Maddie Darling told me

254
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,933
that she had seen the Vaughns,
uh, just before Thanksgivin',

255
00:14:06,976 --> 00:14:08,325
and she said to them

256
00:14:08,369 --> 00:14:10,762
right on the steps
of the Methodist church,

257
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:13,026
"When are you gonna stop
this nonsense

258
00:14:13,069 --> 00:14:14,636
and forgive Elizabeth?"

259
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,247
And she said
that Mrs. Vaughn said,

260
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:20,598
"I thank you very much
to mind your own business."

261
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,122
Hm!

262
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:25,995
Don't you think they know
that Elizabeth is expectin'?

263
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:26,604
I don't know.

264
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,259
Well, surely they've heard
by now.

265
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:31,696
Someone must have told them,
don't you think?

266
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,133
I don't know.

267
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,525
Oh. All right.

268
00:14:36,049 --> 00:14:39,922
I'm certain that the birth
of the baby will reunite you.

269
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,837
Well, I hope so
for Elizabeth's sake.

270
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,186
She doesn't ever talk about it,

271
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,709
but I know she misses
her family.

272
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:46,233
Oh!

273
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:50,019
♪ Silent night

274
00:14:50,063 --> 00:14:53,588
♪ Holy night

-BOBBY: Mama?

277
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,422
Mama?

278
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:05,252
She's not here, Mr. Bobby.
She's in Bay City.

279
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,732
She's gone to your brother's
for Christmas.

280
00:15:07,776 --> 00:15:09,691
What a pret--
uh, pretty Christmas tree.

281
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,127
Could I-- could I come in
to see it?

282
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:12,433
Why certainly.

283
00:15:12,476 --> 00:15:13,825
I don-- uh, I don't believe

284
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,305
we have a Christmas tree
this year,

285
00:15:15,349 --> 00:15:17,003
'cause I've been
all over the house.

286
00:15:17,046 --> 00:15:18,395
I can't find it.

287
00:15:18,439 --> 00:15:19,875
I hope to get what I want
for Christmas,

288
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,355
but I know I won't.

289
00:15:21,398 --> 00:15:22,573
What do you want?

290
00:15:22,617 --> 00:15:24,184
I want some guinea pigs.

291
00:15:24,227 --> 00:15:26,490
Mama says I'm too old for them.

292
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:29,885
I was married
to the sweetest girl, you know.

293
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,540
She, uh-- she was
quite a bit taller than me.

294
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:35,412
She was a real treasure.

295
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:41,070
Uh, she--
she left me, though.

296
00:15:41,114 --> 00:15:45,335
She couldn't stand the climate
in this part of the country.

297
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,033
"It rains so much here,"
she said,

298
00:15:47,076 --> 00:15:50,471
"it's a wonder that you all
don't have webbed feet."

299
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:53,256
I came home one day
and she was gone.

300
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,041
And it-- you--
it was many years

301
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,956
before I could find out
where she went

302
00:15:56,999 --> 00:16:01,003
or I'd have gone after her,
try to get her back.

303
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:03,179
She broke my heart.

304
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,142
Mama says that's what I get

305
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:11,840
for marrying
somebody beneath myself.

306
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,974
She said it never works out.

307
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:21,719
Mama says bein' born common
is like a, uh--

308
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:22,982
like a curse,

309
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,375
'cause you can't do nothing
about it.

310
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,422
Well, common or not,
I said I loved her.

311
00:16:28,465 --> 00:16:30,119
I loved her so.

312
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,036
Where's Horace?

313
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,864
He's still workin', Mr. Bobby.

314
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:38,606
He's always runnin' somewhere.

315
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,303
Here, there, and everywhere.

316
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:45,047
"What's he work so hard for?"
Mama said.

317
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:47,354
"To get in the good graces
of Mr. Henry Vaughn,"

318
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:49,095
I told her.

319
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:50,792
Mr. Henry Vaughn,
his son drove by here

320
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,098
as I was, uh, leavin' home.

321
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:54,317
His son drinks, you know?
Drinks like a fish.

322
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:57,625
I said, "Does your daddy know
that you drink like that, boy?"

323
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,105
He said, "No."

324
00:16:59,148 --> 00:17:00,715
Said,
"He'd kill me if he knew it."

325
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,327
Brother Vaughn is her brother.

326
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:05,502
Whose?

327
00:17:05,546 --> 00:17:07,896
-Mary's.
-That's right.

328
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,289
And Mr. Henry Vaughn
is her father.

329
00:17:10,464 --> 00:17:11,682
And Mrs. Henry Vaughn
is her mother.

330
00:17:11,726 --> 00:17:12,944
Oh?

331
00:17:12,988 --> 00:17:15,469
They don't speak to her
because she eloped.

332
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:18,254
That's right.
I remember that now.

333
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:21,301
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas. Mm.

334
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:22,258
No, no.

335
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,348
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

336
00:17:25,392 --> 00:17:27,089
I have a little something here
for you, Elizabeth.

337
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:28,786
-Oh, why, thank you.
-There you go.

338
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,745
There's a present for you, too,
under the Christmas tree.

339
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:32,660
Oh, how nice!

340
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,576
Oh, how sweet.

341
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:37,752
Oh, why, Mr. Bobby,
what are you doin' here?

342
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,928
Why aren't you in Bay City
with your mama?

343
00:17:39,971 --> 00:17:41,756
We were reminiscing here
about the old times.

344
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,670
Oh.

345
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:45,107
Merry Christmas.

346
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:48,676
Oh, why thank you.
That's sweet.

347
00:17:48,719 --> 00:17:49,851
I think I'll just sit a minute.

348
00:17:49,894 --> 00:17:52,506
Uh, did Mr. George Tyler
ever find you?

349
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,465
He came by here twice
lookin' for you.

350
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:58,860
I passed him
on the way over here.

351
00:17:58,903 --> 00:18:00,862
And I said, "Merry Christmas,
Cousin George,"

352
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,995
and he said-- he said,
"Merry Christmas" to me.

353
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,432
He said nothin'
about comin' here.

354
00:18:05,475 --> 00:18:07,129
When they wouldn't take me
in the army,

355
00:18:07,173 --> 00:18:09,436
I went down and I tried
to join the volunteers,

356
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:11,438
but they wouldn't have me
either.

357
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,483
They said I'd never
stay sober long enough

358
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:15,050
to teach me anything.

359
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,138
"Hell, Bobby," they said,

360
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:17,400
"if we had to depend on you

361
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:20,795
to guard this town
from the Germans,

362
00:18:20,838 --> 00:18:21,709
we'd be in a bad way."

363
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,800
Horace, you think we're
gonna win this damn war?

364
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:31,588
Well, hello, Cousin George.
Why don't you come in?

365
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:35,897
No, I can't stay.
I'm on my way to church.

366
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,204
This isn't Sunday,
Cousin George.

367
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:39,118
What day is it?

368
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:42,338
It's Tuesday. Christmas Eve.

369
00:18:42,382 --> 00:18:43,774
Oh, yeah.

370
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:47,517
I forgot. I came here
to wish you Merry Christmas.

371
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:50,259
Well, thank you.
Merry Christmas to you, too.

372
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,527
You know, I bet Horace
has lived in more houses

373
00:18:57,571 --> 00:18:59,138
than any one of us.

374
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:01,923
Hey, Horace, how many, uh,
places have you stayed in?

375
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:05,274
Bobby, I couldn't begin
to tell you.

376
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:07,711
It would take me a night
to remember them all.

377
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:10,192
Mama used to worry
about you growin' up.

378
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:11,976
"What's to become of that boy?"
she said.

379
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,065
"He-- he lives like a orphan."

380
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:16,764
"Why, he's no orphan,"
I told her. "He's got a mama."

381
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:17,939
"She's-- where is she?

382
00:19:17,982 --> 00:19:20,681
Why isn't she here
taking care of me?"

383
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,248
Has he gone?

384
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,206
Hm? Yes.

385
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:25,381
Steve came and took him away.

386
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:29,559
Hey, Horace, how long has
your daddy been dead?

387
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:34,173
Well, let's see, uh, 16 years.

388
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:35,609
Ah. What, 16 years?

389
00:19:35,652 --> 00:19:37,437
Well, my Daddy's been dead
a lot longer than that.

390
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,742
I don't know how long,

391
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,701
but I was a baby, they'd say,
when he died.

392
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:45,053
Oh, you weren't a baby.
You were a grown man.

393
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:46,837
-I was?
-Yes indeed.

394
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:53,104
Miss Elizabeth, how old were you
when your father died?

395
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,846
He's not dead, Mr. Bobby.
He's still alive.

396
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,327
That's right, yeah. No, but he
don't speak to you.

397
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,937
No, he doesn't.

398
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:12,167
-Hey, Steve.
-Uh, Horace, can I--?

399
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:16,171
Um, uh, Papa sent me in here

400
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,434
to ask you over to the house
later on tonight.

401
00:20:18,478 --> 00:20:20,044
Well, he says he wants to have

402
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:24,048
a long and private talk
with you.

403
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:26,399
Uh, Steve, it's Christmas Eve.
I've been workin' all day.

404
00:20:26,442 --> 00:20:28,139
Yeah, I know. I told Papa that,

405
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:32,100
but he says to tell you
it's life or death.

406
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:41,370
All right, all right.
I'll be over in a little while.

407
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,459
Thank you very much.

408
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,119
What's goin' on?

409
00:20:51,162 --> 00:20:52,773
-We'll go up the street.
-No. Home's over--

410
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,557
-I don't wanna go home now.
-Papa--

411
00:20:54,601 --> 00:20:56,429
"And in the sixth month,
the Angel Gabriel

412
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:57,604
was sent from God

413
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,823
unto a city of Galilee
named Nazareth,

414
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,651
to a virgin espoused to a man

415
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:05,394
whose name was Joseph
of the house of David...

416
00:21:11,922 --> 00:21:13,402
...of the house of David,

417
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,622
and the virgin's name
was Mary.

418
00:21:15,665 --> 00:21:17,885
And the angel came in onto her,
and he said,

419
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:20,061
'Hail thou
that are highly favored.

420
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:22,411
Blessed art thou
among women.'"

421
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:26,763
Horace.

422
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,983
I called over to your house
just now to try to stop you,

423
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:30,637
but you were already gone.

424
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,205
Papa's fallen into a deep sleep
and we don't wanna wake him.

425
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,817
And he hasn't been
sleepin' much lately.

426
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,170
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, no, that's all right.

427
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:44,041
Well, Merry Christmas.

428
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,130
Oh, Merry Christmas.

429
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:18,005
Mmm!

430
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:22,662
How sweet.

431
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,466
Let me have two cards.

432
00:24:08,185 --> 00:24:10,797
Christmas gives us joy.

433
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:17,064

Uh, yes.

449
00:25:40,103 --> 00:25:41,452
Yes.

450
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,454
Yes, I'll call her.

451
00:25:46,022 --> 00:25:48,982
It's for you.
I think it's your mother.

452
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,810
Oh, heavens!

453
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:54,596
Hello?

454
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:57,425
Of course I do. It's Mama!

455
00:26:28,108 --> 00:26:30,458
Well, it was. It was Mama.

456
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,112
She said, "Do you know
who this is, Elizabeth?"

457
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:34,418
And of course I did,
and I said, "Mama."

458
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:36,899
And she said, um, "Yes."

459
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:39,206
And then, she said,
"Merry Christmas."

460
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:42,688
And I began to cry,
and she began to cry.

461
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,994
And then, she said, "May we
come over in a few minutes?

462
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,040
We have a few presents
we'd like to bring you."

463
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,738
And I said, "Yes,"
and that was it.

464
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:56,919
Oh, Horace. We have to get
presents to them some way.

465
00:26:56,963 --> 00:26:59,052
I'll just die if they come here
and we have nothing for them.

466
00:26:59,095 --> 00:27:00,314
Well, we can't do anything
about it now.

467
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:01,750
All the stores are closed.

468
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,317
Didn't you close up
for Mr. Dixon last night?

469
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,579
Yes.

470
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,885
Then you must have the keys
to his store.

471
00:27:05,928 --> 00:27:07,234
Oh, that's right.

472
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:09,279
Hurry down and--
and get something

473
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:10,629
for Mama, and Papa,
and Brother.

474
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,282
-What shall I get them?
-I don't know, Horace.

475
00:27:12,326 --> 00:27:14,067
I can't think, I'm too excited.

476
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,590
-Use your own judgement.
-Well, honey, I can't--

477
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,548
I-I don't know--
I don't know what to get them.

478
00:27:17,592 --> 00:27:19,159
I mean, your Papa doesn't smoke.

479
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:22,075
Uh, no. He likes Big Red
Bandanna handkerchiefs.

480
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,337
Get him some of those.

481
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,686
Get Mama some toilet water,

482
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,863
and get Brother some
linen handkerchiefs. Hurry.

483
00:27:48,275 --> 00:27:50,581
-Mary!
-Come in, Bessie.

484
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,409
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

485
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:54,716
-Mary, I got my guinea pigs!
-Oh!

486
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,023
Mama said she just said
I was too old for guinea pigs

487
00:27:57,066 --> 00:27:58,764
to throw me off the track.

488
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:01,505
I can't ask you to stay
because my mother just called

489
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,856
and-- and she and my father
are on the way over.

490
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:06,423
-Did you have a happy Christmas?
-Oh, yes.

491
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,774
My Mama didn't get a thing
she wanted for Christmas.

492
00:28:08,817 --> 00:28:10,340
She said that the housecoat
Papa bought her

493
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:11,777
was the ugliest thing
she ever saw

494
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,387
and she got so mad,
she threw it at him.

495
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,910
I bought her a pair of bloomers,

496
00:28:14,954 --> 00:28:17,173
and she said that four of her
could get inside of 'em,

497
00:28:17,217 --> 00:28:20,046
so I have to return 'em
for a smaller size.

498
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:21,264
Papa has a headache.

499
00:28:21,308 --> 00:28:23,005
He says he's never known
a happy Christmas,

500
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:25,312
and this year's no exception.

501
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:31,361
Thy-- thy-- thy kingdom come,
thy will be-- kingdom come.

502
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,582
Now I lay me down to sleep

503
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:39,848
and I pray the Lord my soul to--

504
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,224
-Elizabeth.
-Come in.

505
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,922
Elizabeth, is Horace here?

506
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:12,185
No, he's gone to get presents
for my family.

507
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:14,317
They just called to say
they were comin' over.

508
00:29:14,361 --> 00:29:16,319
Oh! Oh, how nice.

509
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:18,800
Oh, well, I wonder
if when Horace gets back,

510
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,062
he could look in on Mr. Bobby.

511
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:21,585
I think he's sick.

512
00:29:21,629 --> 00:29:24,153
Well, I wouldn't wonder.
He was very drunk last night.

513
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:25,851
He is moanin' so loudly,
and then, every now and then...

514
00:29:27,243 --> 00:29:29,115
-...he lets out a scream--
-Is Horace in here?

515
00:29:29,158 --> 00:29:32,074
No, Mr. George,
he's gone to the store.

516
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:33,380
Brought him
a little Christmas present.

517
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:34,816
Well, thank you.

518
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,863
Not much, you understand,
just a little remembrance.

519
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:39,212
-It's very thoughtful of you.
-Yes.

520
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:42,171
Oh! Hello, Cousin George.
Merry Christmas.

521
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,825
Merry Christmas to you, too.

522
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,872
Horace, your cousin George
brought you a Christmas present.

523
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,569
Well, that's, uh--

524
00:29:48,612 --> 00:29:51,615
that's very kind of you,
Cousin George. Thank you.

525
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:52,878
Why don't you come on in
and visit?

526
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,793
Oh, no, no, no, no. I can't.
Merry Christmas.

527
00:29:54,836 --> 00:30:00,015
-Well, Merry Christmas to you.
-Oh, Horace...

528
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:02,104
Did you know
that your Aunt Mary and I

529
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:03,802
were in love with each other?

530
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:08,328
If we had married,
you would call me Uncle George

531
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,459
instead of Cousin.

532
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:13,681
Well, no, sir.
I-I didn't know that.

533
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:21,297
I wonder if that's true
about your Aunt Mary.

534
00:30:21,341 --> 00:30:24,083
Well, I wouldn't know.

535
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:26,694
I'll open this later.
I think it's a handkerchief.

536
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,435
Well, it's the thought
that counts.

537
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:29,653
I got the presents
for your family.

538
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:30,916
Oh, good.

539
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:32,439
Now, Brother's handkerchiefs
are initialed.

540
00:30:32,482 --> 00:30:33,570
Oh, yes.

541
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,789
I got 'H' because Henry's
his name,

542
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,834
though everyone calls him
Brother.

543
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,357
Well, that's what
I would've done.

544
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,881
Um, Horace, you didn't hear
Mr. Bobby as you came in?

545
00:30:39,925 --> 00:30:40,839
No, ma'am.

546
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,318
Oh, I was just tellin' Elizabeth

547
00:30:42,362 --> 00:30:44,277
that he kept me awake
half the night with his moans.

548
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,757
Uh, would you come see
to Mr. Bobby? Please, Horace?

549
00:30:46,801 --> 00:30:48,411
I don't like to go in his room,
you know,

550
00:30:48,455 --> 00:30:51,023
because sometimes he sleeps
without his clothes on.

551
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:52,285
Uh-huh.

552
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:53,721
And take this trash
on your way out, Horace.

553
00:30:53,764 --> 00:30:54,940
-Oh!
-Okay.

554
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,295
Brother!

555
00:31:12,827 --> 00:31:14,437
Brother!

556
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:16,004
You better get down here
right away

557
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,440
if you want a ride with us.

558
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm comin', Papa!

559
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:27,798
Bobby?

560
00:31:38,984 --> 00:31:40,637
Bobby?

561
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:44,815
Bobby?

562
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:47,906
Bobby?

563
00:31:55,174 --> 00:31:56,958
Oh, how sad.

564
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,265
And on Christmas Day, too.

565
00:32:03,617 --> 00:32:04,923
Brother!

566
00:32:08,274 --> 00:32:10,624
Will you get in this Buick now?

567
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,757
If you wanna get along in life,

568
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,499
you'll have to learn
to be on time.

569
00:32:23,028 --> 00:32:25,465
Well, he's quiet now.

570
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:50,098
Elizabeth, look at this.

571
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:53,014
What is it?

572
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,451
It's ten one-hundred
dollar bills.

573
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,279
Mercy!

574
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,983
They're here!

575
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,829
Merry Christmas.

576
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,744
Merry Christmas, Mama.

577
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,184
-Merry Christmas, Papa.
-Oh, Lizzy.

578
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,361
Merry Christmas.

579
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,668
Merry Christmas, Brother.

580
00:33:38,712 --> 00:33:40,453
Merry Christmas, Sister.

581
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:43,543
Oh, my goodness.
Who are all those for?

582
00:33:43,586 --> 00:33:46,502
Well, they're not all for you
and your old man.

583
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:47,547
There's some presents here

584
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,940
for a future member
of the family.

585
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,247
Hello, Horace.
Merry Christmas.

586
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,119
Merry Christmas to you, too.

587
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,513
Merry Christmas, Mr. Vaughn.

588
00:33:57,557 --> 00:34:00,951
Well, uh, thank you.

589
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:03,519
Merry Christmas to you, too.

590
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,534
Our room is in here,
Mr. Vaughn.

591
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:19,970
Oh.

592
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,120
I'm so embarrassed.

593
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,428
I've never seen so many things
in all my life.

594
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,952
Uh, we just got simple things
for you.

595
00:34:44,995 --> 00:34:47,824
They're mostly things
for the baby.

596
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:51,350
I see you have a crib already.
How nice.

597
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:54,135
Yes, they had a sale last month,

598
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,268
so we decided to buy one then.

599
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,748
I'm glad
we didn't get one, then.

600
00:34:58,792 --> 00:35:00,707
-Do you have a buggy?
-No.

601
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,882
Then don't get one.

602
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:03,971
Your Papa and I
have one put aside.

603
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:05,755
Oh, Mama.

604
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,844
These are for the baby,

605
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:10,282
and this is for you.

606
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:11,587
Thank you.

607
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,372
-And this is for you.
-Oh, thank you, Brother.

608
00:35:30,911 --> 00:35:32,217
Oh!

609
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:36,438
Oh, how lovely!

610
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:38,092
Oh, my, my.

611
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,877
I thought you should have
something pretty to wear

612
00:35:40,921 --> 00:35:44,272
when you stay in bed
after you have the baby.

613
00:35:44,316 --> 00:35:46,318
What do you want,
a boy or a girl?

614
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:49,147
-Oh, I don't care, really.
-Huh.

615
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:54,935
Oh, this is very nice.
Thank you.

616
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:56,980
Oh, it smells nice. Yes.

617
00:36:00,941 --> 00:36:03,117
Oh, Elizabeth, look.

618
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,815
My, aren't they pretty?

619
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:07,600
Sure are. Thank you.

620
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:12,605
Well, they're my favorites.
Thank you.

621
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:14,433
You can never have too many.

622
00:36:14,476 --> 00:36:18,567
I hope the shirt fits.
Mr. Lewis said it would.

623
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:20,221
It's a 15 neck.

624
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:22,615
-Well, that's my size.
-And a 34 sleeve.

625
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:23,398
Well, it's perfect.

626
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:29,230
Oh, thanks. I can never have
too many of these either.

627
00:36:31,145 --> 00:36:33,974
It's got my initial on it.

628
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:43,636
How's college, Brother?

629
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:46,029
He doesn't apply himself.

630
00:36:46,073 --> 00:36:47,335
I would've thought
that he would've learned

631
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:48,684
at Allen Academy,

632
00:36:48,728 --> 00:36:50,599
that you have to study
if you wanna make grades.

633
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,341
But they're too lenient
at Allen Academy.

634
00:36:53,385 --> 00:36:54,777
A&M is not lenient.

635
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:56,562
If you don't study
and make your grades,

636
00:36:56,605 --> 00:36:57,911
you'll be kicked out.

637
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:01,567
There were so many rich boys
at Allen Academy.

638
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,743
There was a great deal
of gamblin' goin' on,

639
00:37:03,786 --> 00:37:05,353
and carousing.

640
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,704
I'm afraid Brother sometimes
gets the wrong idea of things.

641
00:37:08,748 --> 00:37:11,011
But his Papa let him know

642
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:13,709
he was not gonna be
like the Darst boys' father

643
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:16,712
and spend his life
gettin' him out of scrapes,

644
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:19,106
that if he makes his bed--

645
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:21,456
Why, Bessie!

646
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:26,331
In all this confusion,
I didn't see you standin' there!

647
00:37:26,374 --> 00:37:28,071
Merry Christmas.

648
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,812
Yes, ma'am. Merry Christmas.

649
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,859
I have to go home now.

650
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:35,165
All right, Bessie.

651
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:43,957
She's over her a lot.

652
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,133
She's been a lot of company
to Elizabeth.

653
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:52,139
Mr. George Tyler is off again,
they said.

654
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:53,445
They can't get him to eat,

655
00:37:53,488 --> 00:37:56,578
he accuses his wife
of poisonin' his food.

656
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:58,101
It's so sad for them all.

657
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:02,062
He went runnin' out
in the front yard late yesterday

658
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:03,585
with no clothes on.

659
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:06,022
-Naked?
-Naked.

660
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:08,198
A fine Christmas
they will have.

661
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:11,158
Oh, he's had these spells
many times before, you know.

662
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:14,161
They try to keep it quiet,
but of course they couldn't.

663
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:19,079
Well, he was just here.
He seemed all right to us.

664
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:20,907
He brought Horace
a Christmas present.

665
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:24,780
Did he? What did he bring you,
Horace?

666
00:38:25,955 --> 00:38:28,828
Ten one-hundred dollar bills.

667
00:38:28,871 --> 00:38:31,265
My goodness.

668
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:34,921
Wasn't that generous of him,
Mr. Vaughn?

669
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:36,270
Yes.

670
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,059
I attended the last public
hangin' in courthouse square.

671
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:44,887
They don't allow 'em there
anymore.

672
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,760
If they hang you now,
it's in the jail.

673
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:48,804
Yes, sir.

674
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,893
Merry Christmas, Mr. George.

675
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:54,767
-Merry Christmas, Sheriff.
-Merry Christmas.

676
00:38:57,073 --> 00:39:00,903
You remember the year
they freed the slaves in Texas?

677
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:02,383
Oh, no, sir.

678
00:39:03,906 --> 00:39:07,040
It was a long time ago, though.
I know that.

679
00:39:07,083 --> 00:39:08,346
Before I was born.

680
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:09,956
June 19!

681
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,396
That is the day that
you celebrate your emancipation.

682
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,963
I remember that.

683
00:39:17,006 --> 00:39:18,965
Yes, sir.

684
00:39:19,008 --> 00:39:21,010
That's the day all right.
It sure is.

685
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,883
Yeah.

686
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:26,494
Well.

687
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,456
Here's a Christmas present
for you.

688
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,328
Thank you, sir.

689
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:43,076
How is your mother, Horace?

690
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,168
Oh, she's, uh--
she's well, last I heard.

691
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:50,910
Horace's mother's
not much of a letter-writer.

692
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:54,000
No. I've never met
your stepfather.

693
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,349
Have you met him, Elizabeth?

694
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,481
Oh, yes.

695
00:39:56,524 --> 00:39:58,091
Uh, just after we were married,

696
00:39:58,134 --> 00:39:59,875
we went down on the train
to Houston

697
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:02,095
and spent the Sunday with them.

698
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:07,187
I had a fine Christmas.

699
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,450
I got $20 from Mama and Papa,

700
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,496
a set of military hairbrushes,

701
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:15,804
a wristwatch, cufflinks,
a pair of gloves.

702
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:17,197
Look what I got.

703
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,549
Oh, Mama, it's beautiful.

704
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,421
Cost a lot of money.

705
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,118
I'm sure it did.

706
00:40:25,161 --> 00:40:27,120
I know what it cost.

707
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,078
Well, how do you know? Huh?

708
00:40:29,122 --> 00:40:31,385
Saw the price tag
before you took it off.

709
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,170
Well, what did you get, Papa?

710
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,172
Nothing as handsome as this.

711
00:40:36,216 --> 00:40:37,260
Oh, I'm pleased.

712
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:39,785
An umbrella,
which I badly needed.

713
00:40:39,828 --> 00:40:43,223
Bedroom slippers, a nightshirt,
socks, and a tie.

714
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:45,573
What did your Mama
send you all?

715
00:40:46,792 --> 00:40:49,882
Well, their presents
haven't arrived yet.

716
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:53,451
You know the mails at Christmas.
Nothing is ever on time.

717
00:40:53,494 --> 00:40:57,629
I'm sure they're sitting
in the post office right now.

718
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:01,676
They know, of course,
about the baby?

719
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,373
Oh, yes. I wrote them.

720
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,332
I'm sure they're pleased.

721
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:07,421
Oh, I'm sure they are.

722
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,902
Um, they haven't written back
yet.

723
00:41:09,945 --> 00:41:13,688
Like I said, they're not
great letter-writers.

724
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:24,482
Oh, dear. Oh.

725
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:31,532
I remember my brother Billy

726
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:33,491
worrying so about you
on Christmas, Horace,

727
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:34,796
when you were a boy.

728
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,885
I was very close
to my brother Billy, you know?

729
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:39,453
Oh, yes, sir.
Elizabeth said you were.

730
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,194
He was very smart.

731
00:41:41,237 --> 00:41:43,588
It's tragic he died so young.

732
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:45,372
I always had hopes that Brother

733
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:48,157
would follow in his footsteps
and study law.

734
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:51,030
Papa, I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to disappoint you.

735
00:41:51,073 --> 00:41:53,815
I want to make a lot of money
just like you have.

736
00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:55,034
Did you know, Horace,

737
00:41:55,077 --> 00:41:57,515
that before Mr. Galbraith
shot Mr. Mason,

738
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:58,994
and his bank was so unsteady

739
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:00,692
because of all the money
they had loaned the farmers

740
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:01,823
during all those years

741
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:03,042
when they had
so many crop failures--

742
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,609
What's the point of your story,
Brother?

743
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:07,046
The point of my story, Papa,

744
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,091
is that the bank
would've gone under

745
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:11,659
with all the money owed it
they couldn't collect

746
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,575
if you hadn't taken
$50,000 of your own money

747
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,490
and given it to them to use.

748
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,580
You have to see how they act
when Papa walks in.

749
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:22,191
They just jump up and dance
when they see him.

750
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,457
I guess you both are plannin'
to go to Mr. Galbraith's trial?

751
00:42:27,501 --> 00:42:29,895
That's gonna be a good one.

752
00:42:29,938 --> 00:42:32,288
I bet $2
Mr. Galbraith will be convicted

753
00:42:32,332 --> 00:42:33,420
and sent to the pen.

754
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:35,248
-You bet?
-Sure I did.

755
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:38,425
Easiest $2 I ever made.
He's guilty.

756
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:40,296
He shot Mr. Galbraith
and killed him.

757
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,907
They're gonna send him
to the pen.

758
00:42:41,950 --> 00:42:44,562
I am not discussing his guilt,
I'm discussing your betting.

759
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:47,129
I thought you'd learned
your lesson at Allen Academy.

760
00:42:47,173 --> 00:42:48,348
I thought you'd given me
your word

761
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:49,654
when you were suspended
from there

762
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:51,569
never to gamble or wager again.

763
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:54,441
Please, Mr. Vaughn,
let's don't spoil our Christmas.

764
00:42:54,484 --> 00:42:56,312
Well, it's spoiled for me,
thank you.

765
00:42:56,356 --> 00:42:58,619
To think he's not learned
his lesson about gambling.

766
00:42:58,663 --> 00:43:02,884
I have, Papa. I won't ever
go near dice or cards.

767
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:04,843
I swore to you I wouldn't,
and I won't.

768
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:09,761
You can gamble without the use
of dice or cards, you know.

769
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:13,416
Well, my God,
I'm sorry I mentioned it.

770
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,723
I didn't mean a thing
in the world by it.

771
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:19,640
If I win,
I won't collect the bet.

772
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:24,689
We all know he's guilty.
He's going to the pen.

773
00:43:28,083 --> 00:43:31,173
Well, let's change the subject,
for goodness sake.

774
00:43:31,217 --> 00:43:32,697
It's Christmas Day.

775
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,047
Elizabeth!

776
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,529
Oh. I hate terribly
to bother you all, but, well--

777
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:41,488
Well, I'm sure that, uh,
Horace and Elizabeth

778
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:43,359
have told you
about poor Mr. Bobby.

779
00:43:43,403 --> 00:43:45,492
-No.
-No?

780
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,798
Oh, well.

781
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:49,104
He is D-R-U-N-K.

782
00:43:49,148 --> 00:43:50,671
Uh, did you call the doctor?

783
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:54,675
Yes, I did, but as you know,
he's so small and slight,

784
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:57,504
he feels he can't handle
Mr. Bobby by himself.

785
00:43:57,547 --> 00:44:00,072
So, he says he needs the help
of two strong men

786
00:44:00,115 --> 00:44:01,421
to help hold him down.

787
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:04,163
-I'll give you a hand, Horace.
-Oh, thank you.

788
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:05,425
Oh.

789
00:44:07,035 --> 00:44:10,256
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Bobby.

790
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:12,388
Hey, uh,
I'm lookin' for my mother.

791
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:14,521
-Yeah, she's in Bay City, Bobby.
-Oh.

792
00:44:14,564 --> 00:44:16,915
-Merry Christmas, Bobby.
-Uh--

793
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,484
-Is this Christmas?
-Yes it is, Bobby.

794
00:44:21,528 --> 00:44:23,965
-Oh. What's the year, please?
-It's 1917.

795
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:25,314
-Are we at war?
-Uh-huh.

796
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:27,839
Uh, Mr. Henry Vaughn, uh,
he wouldn't take me

797
00:44:27,882 --> 00:44:29,492
when I volunteered my services.

798
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:31,625
He said I wasn't good enough
to serve my country.

799
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,757
Uh, that's not true, Bobby.

800
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,149
You're certainly good enough,

801
00:44:34,193 --> 00:44:36,282
but you see, we have
certain physical standards.

802
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:38,719
-Who are you?
-Henry Vaughn.

803
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:39,851
That's right.

804
00:44:39,894 --> 00:44:41,722
And he did try to join
several times,

805
00:44:41,766 --> 00:44:43,550
and that's certainly
commendable.

806
00:44:43,593 --> 00:44:45,552
It makes you sick the way
some of them do anything

807
00:44:45,595 --> 00:44:47,075
to keep out of it.

808
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,121
Lonnie Bigelow shot his toe off
to keep out of the army.

809
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:50,775
We can't be sure of that,
Brother.

810
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,602
It might just have been
an accident.

811
00:44:52,646 --> 00:44:54,822
Wasn't no accident.
It was deliberate.

812
00:44:54,866 --> 00:44:56,345
Lonnie Bigelow told Steve Mason

813
00:44:56,389 --> 00:44:58,217
if shooting one big toe off
didn't keep him out,

814
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,262
he'd shoot the other one off.

815
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:02,003
Here you are, Bobby.

816
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:05,006
I've been lookin' all over
for you.

817
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:07,139
Who are you?

818
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:11,404
Why, I'm Dr. Goodhue, Bobby.
Now, you know who I am.

819
00:45:11,447 --> 00:45:12,797
What do you want with me?

820
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,756
I want to give you something
to quiet you,

821
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:18,716
make you feel better,
maybe even sleep a little.

822
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:20,152
You're not giving me anything.

823
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:22,458
You're not making a dope fiend
out of me.

824
00:45:22,502 --> 00:45:24,243
Uh, you made a dope fiend
out of Harry Newsome,

825
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,158
sticking him with needles,
but you ain't doin' it to me.

826
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:28,551
Now, Bobby, that's not true.
You know that's not true.

827
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:31,380
Harry Newsome says it's true.
He's a dope fiend.

828
00:45:31,424 --> 00:45:32,599
And he says
that you're responsible.

829
00:45:32,642 --> 00:45:33,774
Bobby, Bobby, you're drunk.

830
00:45:33,818 --> 00:45:34,862
You don't know
what you're saying.

831
00:45:34,906 --> 00:45:36,472
I know what I'm sayin'.

832
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,910
I was in the saloon the night
Raymond Happ came in,

833
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:40,781
and he walked over to Briggs,
the saloon keep.

834
00:45:40,825 --> 00:45:43,349
He says, "I told you
if you sold my daddy

835
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:45,351
another bottle of whiskey,
I'd kill you."

836
00:45:45,394 --> 00:45:46,831
And he, uh, uh--

837
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:49,007
He took out his gun,
and he killed him,

838
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:50,486
and they let him go free,

839
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,488
'cause they said Briggs
had made a drunkard of his daddy

840
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,099
by sellin' him whiskey.

841
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:57,798
And, uh, uh, they're gonna let
Mr. Galbraith go free, too,

842
00:45:57,842 --> 00:46:00,409
'cause I-I bet Brother Vaughn
$40 they would.

843
00:46:00,453 --> 00:46:02,107
-Bobby, Bobby--
-That's $40 final.

844
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:03,586
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Now, come with me now.

845
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:06,589
Oh, take your goddamn hands
off me.

846
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:21,648
You son of a bitch.

847
00:46:21,691 --> 00:46:23,258
Hey, Bobby.
There are ladies present.

848
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:24,694
Horace,
I'll need some help here.

849
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:28,437
-Come on, Bobby.
-No, let go of me, goddamn--

850
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:30,309
Oh!

851
00:46:30,352 --> 00:46:32,050
Bobby.

852
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,235
You drunken bastard.

853
00:46:43,278 --> 00:46:45,411
You're drunk as much as I am.

854
00:46:57,597 --> 00:46:59,555
Isn't it sad?

855
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,558
He's so gentlemanly, too,
when he's sober.

856
00:47:12,568 --> 00:47:16,398
I hope your brother
gets his eyes opened by this.

857
00:47:18,444 --> 00:47:20,576
Preachin' doesn't do
a bit of good, you know,

858
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:23,275
but, uh, sometimes

859
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:27,757
when they actually see
something like this happenin'...

860
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,505
No.

861
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:38,290
-Come on.
-No!

862
00:47:38,333 --> 00:47:40,074
-No!
-Come on, Bobby. Come on.

863
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:44,122
No, goddamn it!
Goddamn it.

864
00:47:44,165 --> 00:47:47,255
Elizabeth, I'm worried
about your brother.

865
00:47:48,953 --> 00:47:53,174
You heard what Mr. Bobby
said about him just now.

866
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:56,090
Well, he was drunk, Mama.

867
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:57,918
He didn't know
what he was sayin'.

868
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,966
They've just gotten him
on the bed.

869
00:48:02,009 --> 00:48:03,837
He fights like a wild man.

870
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,405
Your Papa is workin' so hard,
Elizabeth.

871
00:48:06,448 --> 00:48:09,756
Everyone calls on him
when they need something done.

872
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:11,410
When the bank reorganization
is done,

873
00:48:11,453 --> 00:48:14,500
I am gonna make him go with me
to Mineral Wells

874
00:48:14,543 --> 00:48:17,285
and we'll take the baths
for a week.

875
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:22,334
Please, don't ask Horace anymore
about presents from his family.

876
00:48:22,377 --> 00:48:25,380
You know, I don't think they've
ever exchanged gifts with him.

877
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:28,035
He's extremely sensitive
about it.

878
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,298
I know this year he thought
they would send something,

879
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:31,865
because he kept goin'
to the post office

880
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,649
and lookin' for something
from them.

881
00:48:33,693 --> 00:48:35,303
Did he send them anything?

882
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:36,348
Yes, he did.

883
00:48:36,391 --> 00:48:37,784
He acted like he might not,

884
00:48:37,827 --> 00:48:41,266
because, like he said,
they've never exchange gifts.

885
00:48:41,309 --> 00:48:43,790
And I thought
he wasn't goin' to.

886
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:47,272
So I went down and bought
a few things without tellin' him

887
00:48:47,315 --> 00:48:48,751
and sent them on.

888
00:48:48,795 --> 00:48:50,840
And then, he bought some things
and sent them on

889
00:48:50,884 --> 00:48:52,277
without sayin' anything to me.

890
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,279
And Miss Virgie
was in Houston last week

891
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:55,367
and she saw his mother,

892
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,846
and she said she was
very confused

893
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:59,110
because she'd gotten two boxes
of presents.

894
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:00,415
She told Miss Virgie

895
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:02,940
she was worried
about our bein' extravagant.

896
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:05,812
She said it put her
in a terrible position,

897
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:07,901
because, um, his stepfather

898
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,078
never sends anything
to his people at Christmas.

899
00:49:11,122 --> 00:49:12,862
And she doesn't like to ask him
for the money

900
00:49:12,906 --> 00:49:15,300
for her people at Christmastime.

901
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:18,825
I think he's a very strange man.

902
00:49:18,868 --> 00:49:20,218
The stepfather?

903
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:23,961
Yes. I don't think Horace
cares too much for him.

904
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:26,006
I'm sorry.

905
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:28,008
They never go near him,
you know?

906
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:29,575
And it hurts him.

907
00:49:29,618 --> 00:49:31,620
I tell him it shouldn't,
but it does.

908
00:49:31,664 --> 00:49:33,231
It would hurt me.

909
00:49:33,274 --> 00:49:35,015
Wouldn't it hurt you,
Mr. Vaughn?

910
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:38,279
I guess, but my God,
he should be used to it by now.

911
00:49:38,323 --> 00:49:40,760
He's never had a home.
Has he ever had a home?

912
00:49:40,803 --> 00:49:42,022
He has a home now.

913
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,416
Oh, this isn't a home.
It's a rented room.

914
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,461
I think it's very nice.

915
00:49:46,505 --> 00:49:48,681
Well, that may be,
but it's still a rented room.

916
00:49:48,724 --> 00:49:52,119
A home is something you own,
that belongs to you.

917
00:49:54,121 --> 00:49:58,604
He has the strength of ten men.
He wore me out.

918
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:01,433
-Did he give him a shot?
-Uh, yes, sir.

919
00:50:02,912 --> 00:50:05,611
-Hey. Where's Brother?
-Well, he's on his way down.

920
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,047
He was helpin' Miss Ruth find

921
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,049
where Mr. Bobby has
all his whiskey hidden.

922
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:10,529
She's afraid
that when the dope wears off,

923
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:11,573
he'll start to drink again,

924
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:13,619
unless they can find
the bottles.

925
00:50:13,662 --> 00:50:14,881
I'll get him for you.

926
00:50:14,924 --> 00:50:17,579
-Phone for you, Horace.
-Thank you, Brother.

927
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:20,887
Hello.

928
00:50:20,930 --> 00:50:21,888
Hello, Steve.

929
00:50:22,845 --> 00:50:25,370
-Is Bobby quiet?
-He's calmer.

930
00:50:25,413 --> 00:50:26,632
Now?

931
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,112
He wants Miss Ruth to sing
the song she sang

932
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:29,765
at the soldier's benefit.

933
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,376
Is she going to?

934
00:50:31,419 --> 00:50:32,725
I guess so.

935
00:50:32,768 --> 00:50:35,467
She says she'll do anything
to keep him quiet.

936
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,516
Mr. Bobby is wrong

937
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,868
when he says that I bet him
$40 about Mr. Galbraith.

938
00:50:45,912 --> 00:50:48,480
I never said anything about $40.

939
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,047
It was $2.

940
00:50:51,178 --> 00:50:52,527
I didn't wanna correct him,
though,

941
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,094
because drunk as he was,

942
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:57,228
I knew that it would probably
just start an argument.

943
00:50:57,271 --> 00:50:59,143
Goodbye.

944
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:02,015
Excuse me.

945
00:51:06,019 --> 00:51:08,674
Steve Tyler says he's, uh,
comin' over to talk to me.

946
00:51:08,717 --> 00:51:10,502
Why does he wanna talk to you?

947
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,548
I don't know.

948
00:51:23,384 --> 00:51:25,125
We'd better be getting
back home, Mary.

949
00:51:25,169 --> 00:51:27,258
It's almost time for our dinner.

950
00:51:28,215 --> 00:51:30,739

Bye!

963
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,889
I'm so glad we've all made up.

964
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,587
Yes.

965
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:40,287
That-- that was the nicest
Christmas present of all.

966
00:52:40,331 --> 00:52:41,767
Mm-hm.

967
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:53,300
I don't understand
my mother or my sister.

968
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,128
Would've thought
they would have sent

969
00:52:55,172 --> 00:53:00,264
some kind of present
to you at least, or the baby.

970
00:53:00,307 --> 00:53:02,744
I don't care about myself.

971
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:05,530
It doesn't matter to me.

972
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:08,141
Yeah, well,
I wish I could say that,

973
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,056
but it does matter to me.

974
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:20,371
I'm--

975
00:53:20,414 --> 00:53:22,111
I'm ashamed of myself,
Elizabeth,

976
00:53:22,155 --> 00:53:27,465
but I felt such envy just now.

977
00:53:27,508 --> 00:53:30,250
I looked at your father,
and I thought,

978
00:53:30,294 --> 00:53:32,470
I envy him, his success,

979
00:53:32,513 --> 00:53:34,950
his well-being, his affluence,

980
00:53:34,994 --> 00:53:39,564
and I envy his children
having a father like that.

981
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:41,870
Sending them to college.

982
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:47,049
I-I-I don't understand
your brother

983
00:53:47,093 --> 00:53:50,227
not taking advantage
of an education.

984
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,925
Sometimes I think
that if I'd had someone help me

985
00:53:52,968 --> 00:53:56,798
get through high school
and college,

986
00:53:56,842 --> 00:53:59,279
my whole life
would be different.

987
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:02,195
Well, I think you've done
very well.

988
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,850
I'm very proud of you.

989
00:54:04,893 --> 00:54:06,243
We've been married less
than a year

990
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:07,287
and you have money saved.

991
00:54:07,331 --> 00:54:08,810
Well, I-I'm not complaining.

992
00:54:08,854 --> 00:54:13,641
I know I've got a lot
to be grateful for, but...

993
00:54:13,685 --> 00:54:16,122
...who isn't doing well now
with the war on

994
00:54:16,165 --> 00:54:17,471
and the world needing
our cotton,

995
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:19,647
and cotton selling
for 40 cents a pound?

996
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:22,346
I mean, if you can't do well
now, when can you?

997
00:54:22,389 --> 00:54:25,653
Suppose the war isn't over
next year,

998
00:54:25,697 --> 00:54:26,785
or the next,

999
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:27,960
and all the unmarried men
are taken,

1000
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:29,440
and they need more men,

1001
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:31,224
and they start draftin'
those of us that have children.

1002
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,922
I worry how long the few dollars
I've been able to save

1003
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:36,142
will take care of you
and the baby.

1004
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,800
I mean, imagine being able
to walk into the bank

1005
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:43,323
like your father did, and say,

1006
00:54:43,367 --> 00:54:47,414
"Here's $50,000.
Use it to save your bank."

1007
00:54:50,896 --> 00:54:52,637
God help me, Elizabeth.

1008
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,596
God help me, I am jealous
of your father. Forgive me.

1009
00:54:59,687 --> 00:55:04,910
When I was nine years old, I...

1010
00:55:04,953 --> 00:55:07,304
...I had some chickens
that I raised as pets.

1011
00:55:07,347 --> 00:55:09,958
They were the--
the only pets I ever had.

1012
00:55:10,002 --> 00:55:11,308
And I loved them.

1013
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,048
They used to eat out of my hands
when I fed them

1014
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:15,355
and follow me
around the yard like--

1015
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:17,618
like dogs do their owners.

1016
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:19,359
Mama had a boarding house then,

1017
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:22,319
and on Christmas
of my ninth year,

1018
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:23,755
she had no money
to feed her boys,

1019
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:25,234
so without telling me,
she went out back

1020
00:55:25,278 --> 00:55:27,106
and killed the chickens

1021
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:29,369
for their Christmas dinner.

1022
00:55:33,808 --> 00:55:38,813
When I found out, I became ill.

1023
00:55:38,857 --> 00:55:40,728
Had a raging fever for a week.

1024
00:55:40,772 --> 00:55:45,298
Mama says the illness
was never diagnosed.

1025
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,953
When I see her now,

1026
00:55:47,996 --> 00:55:49,607
well, she's--

1027
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:52,044
she's all smiles and honey.

1028
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:54,960
She doesn't know the pain,
or the unhappiness,

1029
00:55:55,003 --> 00:55:56,440
or the bitterness
that she's caused me.

1030
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:57,745
Sometimes when I'm around her,

1031
00:55:57,789 --> 00:55:59,573
I have to get up
and walk out of the room

1032
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,358
to keep from tellin' her.

1033
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:07,581
I'm no orphan, but I think
of myself as an orphan,

1034
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:10,454
belonging to no one but you.

1035
00:56:10,497 --> 00:56:15,067
I intend to have everything
I didn't have before:

1036
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,069
a house of my own,

1037
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:20,333
some land, a yard.

1038
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,467
And in that yard,
I will have growing things:

1039
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:27,166
fig trees, and pear trees,
and peach trees.

1040
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:28,123
Some chickens.

1041
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:32,911
And I do believe I might now
have all these things

1042
00:56:32,954 --> 00:56:35,130
because you married me.

1043
00:56:35,174 --> 00:56:36,436
I said to myself--

1044
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,395
Before we were married,
I said to myself,

1045
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:39,874
"She will never marry you.

1046
00:56:39,918 --> 00:56:41,354
No matter how much
she loves you,

1047
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:42,486
her father will stop us.

1048
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,270
He's a powerful man.

1049
00:56:44,313 --> 00:56:47,404
And he will prevail
as he does in all ways."

1050
00:56:50,798 --> 00:56:52,887
But he didn't stop us.

1051
00:56:54,759 --> 00:56:56,630
You did marry me.

1052
00:56:58,676 --> 00:57:01,287
And I tell you,

1053
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:05,378
I have begun to know happiness
for the first time in my life.

1054
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:10,383
I adore you.

1055
00:57:11,471 --> 00:57:13,473
I worship you.

1056
00:57:13,517 --> 00:57:14,561
And...

1057
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,000
I thank you for marrying me.

1058
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:28,488
Horace?

1059
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,621
Yes, Steve?

1060
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:34,842
Was my father here earlier?

1061
00:57:34,886 --> 00:57:36,540
Yes, he was.

1062
00:57:36,583 --> 00:57:38,280
Did he, uh, give you a present?

1063
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:39,760
A Christmas present?

1064
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:40,935
Well, yes he did.

1065
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:42,328
Was it money?

1066
00:57:42,371 --> 00:57:44,983
-Yes.
-My God.

1067
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:46,898
Well, it seems
the day before yesterday,

1068
00:57:46,941 --> 00:57:51,816
he had taken out $15,000
in one-hundred dollar bills

1069
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:54,209
and had told the teller
it was for Christmas presents

1070
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:55,515
for his colored friends,

1071
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,343
and Daddy said
you were one of 'em.

1072
00:57:58,257 --> 00:57:59,563
And the tellers said,

1073
00:57:59,606 --> 00:58:01,129
"I didn't think Horace Robedaux
was colored,"

1074
00:58:01,173 --> 00:58:02,435
and he said that Daddy said,

1075
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,569
"Well, he's not,
but he's my cousin."

1076
00:58:05,612 --> 00:58:06,918
Teller said he thought,
of course,

1077
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:10,487
that he wasn't makin'
a great deal of sense.

1078
00:58:14,012 --> 00:58:16,493
Oh, thank you.

1079
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:19,844
You don't know
where else he went to?

1080
00:58:19,887 --> 00:58:22,020
No, I don't.

1081
00:58:24,588 --> 00:58:27,504
-Merry Christmas to you both.
-Merry Christmas to you.

1082
00:58:45,957 --> 00:58:49,438
♪ That made me love Mary

1083
00:58:49,482 --> 00:58:53,051
♪ The rose who...

1084
00:58:58,709 --> 00:59:00,319
-Good morning.
-Morning!

1085
00:59:00,362 --> 00:59:02,408
I-I'm takin' a walk uptown.
Do you need anything?

1086
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:04,628
-Not today, thank you.
-Oh.

1087
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:06,281
I hope I'll get a letter today

1088
00:59:06,325 --> 00:59:08,196
from Mrs. Pate or Mr. Bobby
from Galveston.

1089
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,069
I sure hope Mr. Bobby
sticks with that Keeley Cure.

1090
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:13,593
I haven't heard a word yet.
I hope they're all right.

1091
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:17,075
Well, no news is good news,
they say.

1092
00:59:17,118 --> 00:59:19,556
-Bye.
-Bye.

1093
00:59:24,212 --> 00:59:25,387
Good mornin', Henry.

1094
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,606
Oh, good mornin', Ned.

1095
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,912
You know where Horace is?

1096
00:59:27,955 --> 00:59:29,740
-No, I don't.
-I wonder if he's sick.

1097
00:59:29,783 --> 00:59:31,176
Oh, I don't believe so.

1098
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:33,700
I think Elizabeth
would've told us if he was sick.

1099
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:35,441
-You wanna buy something?
-No.

1100
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:37,443
Got a bill I wanna collect.

1101
00:59:38,444 --> 00:59:39,793
Is it a large bill?

1102
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:41,665
No, no.

1103
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:43,231
He always manages
to pay his bill on time,

1104
00:59:43,275 --> 00:59:44,885
regardless of what they are.

1105
00:59:44,929 --> 00:59:47,018
Well, I'm certainly pleased
to hear that.

1106
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:51,718
Is Mr. Horace not back yet?

1107
00:59:51,762 --> 00:59:53,328
Uh, no.

1108
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:54,982
Hm.

1109
00:59:55,026 --> 00:59:56,636
Come to get a suit for Easter?

1110
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,856
No, I'm just here
to collect a bill.

1111
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:00,597
Hm. Is that so?

1112
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,686
I come to spend some money
with him,

1113
01:00:02,729 --> 01:00:05,079
and you come to take
some money from him. Hm.

1114
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:18,136
-Good morning, Horace.
-Morning, Steve.

1115
01:00:18,179 --> 01:00:20,268
Papa's upstairs in his room.

1116
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:22,967
-Thank you.
-All right.

1117
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:33,586
Come in, son.

1118
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:36,458
How are you this morning?

1119
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,330
Pretty well, thank you.

1120
01:00:39,244 --> 01:00:40,419
Hasn't this rain been something?

1121
01:00:40,462 --> 01:00:41,507
Mm.

1122
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:43,683
Terrible for the cotton.

1123
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:44,989
What's it like today?

1124
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:47,513
Oh, it's, uh--
it's very pleasant.

1125
01:00:47,556 --> 01:00:51,256
May we have nice weather
for Easter for a change.

1126
01:00:51,299 --> 01:00:53,693
Easter Bunny gonna be nice
to you this year?

1127
01:00:54,694 --> 01:00:57,741
I sure-- I sure hope so.

1128
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:00,352
Son, I called you over

1129
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:05,400
'cause I want you to go
to your family for me,

1130
01:01:05,444 --> 01:01:07,446
and I want you
to ask their forgiveness.

1131
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:10,623
I've done 'em a grave injustice.

1132
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,930
How's that, Cousin George?

1133
01:01:12,973 --> 01:01:15,759
'Cause I was in love
with your Aunt Mary,

1134
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:17,195
and she was in love with me,

1135
01:01:17,238 --> 01:01:20,024
and I broke her heart.

1136
01:01:21,155 --> 01:01:22,896
How is your Aunt Mary?

1137
01:01:24,289 --> 01:01:29,511
Why, Cousin George,
Aunt Mary's dead.

1138
01:01:29,555 --> 01:01:32,123
Has been dead for 12 years.

1139
01:01:33,341 --> 01:01:35,126
I thought you knew that.

1140
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:38,782
Where is she buried?

1141
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:40,740
Out in West Texas.

1142
01:01:42,046 --> 01:01:43,482
Where in West Texas?

1143
01:01:45,092 --> 01:01:45,919
Bandero.

1144
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:51,403
I wanna go there right away.

1145
01:01:54,536 --> 01:01:55,755
Where's Steve?

1146
01:01:55,799 --> 01:01:57,365
Well, he's--
he's out in the gallery.

1147
01:01:57,409 --> 01:01:58,410
Will you go?

1148
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,196
Please.

1149
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:08,246
Won't you go out there,

1150
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:10,814
tell Steve to go to the bank
right away,

1151
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:13,991
get some money for my trip?

1152
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:32,357
Did you hear from Mr. Bobby?

1153
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,751
Oh, just his mother.

1154
01:02:34,794 --> 01:02:36,187
-She sent a card.
-Oh.

1155
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:40,539
Um, "Everything well here.
Hope all is well there.

1156
01:02:40,582 --> 01:02:42,323
Isabel Pate and son Bobby."

1157
01:02:42,367 --> 01:02:43,934
See?

1158
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:47,894
Oh, and it's a pretty picture
of the Galveston boardwalk.

1159
01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:49,200
Have you ever been to Galveston?

1160
01:02:49,243 --> 01:02:51,376
-Oh, yes. A number of times.
-Oh.

1161
01:02:51,419 --> 01:02:52,769
I have two aunts
that live there.

1162
01:02:52,812 --> 01:02:55,815
-My father's sisters.
-Yes, of course.

1163
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,338
I love Galveston.

1164
01:02:57,382 --> 01:03:00,689
Well, I've never been there.
I hope to go someday.

1165
01:03:00,733 --> 01:03:02,909
In the summer,
they have excursions

1166
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:04,911
that leave from here
at five in the mornin',

1167
01:03:04,955 --> 01:03:06,695
get you to Galveston at eight,

1168
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:09,394
and then, bring you back
at ten that very same evenin'.

1169
01:03:09,437 --> 01:03:10,830
My aunts live near the beach.

1170
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,484
They have a wonderful house.

1171
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:14,703
Did it last
through that 1900 storm?

1172
01:03:14,747 --> 01:03:15,879
-Yes, it did.
-Mm-hm.

1173
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:17,837
Well, then,
it'll last though anything.

1174
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,840
Was there anything worse
than that 1900 storm?

1175
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:23,451
Well, it must've been terrible,
but I really don't remember it.

1176
01:03:23,495 --> 01:03:25,236
Oh.

1177
01:03:25,279 --> 01:03:26,585
Oh!

1178
01:03:26,628 --> 01:03:29,501
I almost forgot,
I saw your father uptown,

1179
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:32,547
and he asked me
to give this to you.

1180
01:03:32,591 --> 01:03:34,680
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

1181
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:39,772
-Is that the time? Good Lord.
-I'm afraid so.

1182
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,470
I have not made my bed yet.

1183
01:03:42,514 --> 01:03:45,299
I'm glad I've had no callers.

1184
01:03:59,792 --> 01:04:01,533
Papa!

1185
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:04,841
Papa, where you goin'?

1186
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:11,848
Mr. George?

1187
01:04:13,066 --> 01:04:14,763
-Elizabeth.
-Yes, sir?

1188
01:04:14,807 --> 01:04:16,113
What you reading?

1189
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:17,766
Holland's Magazine.

1190
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:19,159
Interestin' stories?

1191
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:21,205
Well, I think so.
I'm not lookin' at the stories,

1192
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:24,556
I'm-- I'm lookin'
at the house plans.

1193
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:25,774
-Elizabeth?
-Yes?

1194
01:04:25,818 --> 01:04:27,254
I can't go uptown.

1195
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:29,213
Could you call Horace
and tell him to meet me here

1196
01:04:29,256 --> 01:04:30,431
in an hour or so?

1197
01:04:30,475 --> 01:04:31,780
All right.

1198
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:34,218
Holland's Magazine.

1199
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:35,654
Magazine of the South.

1200
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,658
-You subscribe?
-Yes, sir.

1201
01:04:39,701 --> 01:04:42,443
Horace gave me a subscription
for Christmas.

1202
01:04:42,487 --> 01:04:44,924
You recommend that I subscribe?

1203
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:46,926
I think you might enjoy it.

1204
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,755
I subscribe
to National Geographic.

1205
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:55,326
I always planned to travel,
but I've gone no place.

1206
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:58,807
You have a good recipe
for Dixie biscuits?

1207
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,766
Well, I think my mother has one.

1208
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:02,550
Would you ask her for it,
please?

1209
01:05:02,594 --> 01:05:15,389
I asked my wife...

1210
01:05:15,433 --> 01:05:16,216
Hey!

1211
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:23,049
...to fix some Dixie biscuits
for me this morning.

1212
01:05:23,093 --> 01:05:25,138
She said she didn't know how.
Can you believe that?

1213
01:05:27,401 --> 01:05:29,577
I come from a family of cooks,
you know.

1214
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:33,799
My mother was a great cook,
my grandmother even better.

1215
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:34,713
You a good cook?

1216
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:37,498
Well, I hope to be.

1217
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:39,457
Uh, we-- we don't have
a kitchen here.

1218
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,459
We take our meals out.

1219
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:44,679
I'm goin' down to the river
for a swim.

1220
01:05:44,723 --> 01:05:46,812
Will you join me?

1221
01:05:46,855 --> 01:05:48,292
No, thank you.

1222
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:49,989
Never go down there
without a gun.

1223
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:51,208
Alligators down there.

1224
01:05:52,209 --> 01:05:53,601
Poisonous snakes.

1225
01:05:53,645 --> 01:05:57,692
Coral snakes, moccasins,
cottonmouths.

1226
01:06:05,526 --> 01:06:06,963
Yes?

1227
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,704
He was just here
lookin' for you.

1228
01:06:14,883 --> 01:06:17,103
He's gone down to the river.

1229
01:07:07,501 --> 01:07:09,155
Mr. George Tyler's off again.

1230
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:10,678
I know. He was just here.

1231
01:07:16,119 --> 01:07:17,642
Whoo!

1232
01:07:45,235 --> 01:07:46,975
Ah!

1233
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:54,896
Ha.

1234
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:57,682
Ha.

1235
01:07:59,988 --> 01:08:02,730
Well, Mr. Galbraith walked away
a free man.

1236
01:08:02,774 --> 01:08:06,430
He's not free.
He got a suspended sentence.

1237
01:08:06,473 --> 01:08:09,259
Yes, ma'am,
but he didn't go to jail.

1238
01:08:09,302 --> 01:08:11,565
I wonder if Mr. Bobby
collected the $40

1239
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:13,089
from your brother.

1240
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:16,918
I don't know. Brother claims
the bet was only for two.

1241
01:08:33,065 --> 01:08:34,632
Ah!

1242
01:08:51,257 --> 01:08:52,780
Papa!

1243
01:08:55,218 --> 01:08:57,220
Papa!

1244
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:03,748
-I think I see him over there.
-Where?

1245
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,141
Back yonder.

1246
01:09:05,184 --> 01:09:07,186
Mr. George!

1247
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:08,448
We know you're there,
Mr. George.

1248
01:09:08,492 --> 01:09:10,929
Now, why don't you answer us?

1249
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:13,932
Papa, it's Steve.

1250
01:09:15,063 --> 01:09:16,587
Can you hear me?

1251
01:09:16,630 --> 01:09:18,066
Where's Horace Robedaux?

1252
01:09:18,110 --> 01:09:20,678
He's right here beside me.

1253
01:09:23,246 --> 01:09:26,118
We've come
to take you home now, Papa.

1254
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,340
Horace.

1255
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:32,994
Yes, sir.

1256
01:09:34,431 --> 01:09:36,955
I want you take me to Bandero.

1257
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:40,219
I wanna visit Mary's grave.

1258
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,875
Yes, sir.

1259
01:09:45,659 --> 01:09:48,314
Is there a train
from here to Bandero?

1260
01:09:48,358 --> 01:09:50,273
I guess so.

1261
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,928
Well, would you please find out?

1262
01:09:53,972 --> 01:09:56,583
-Yes, sir.
-You go on home now.

1263
01:09:56,627 --> 01:09:59,238
But tell him you're finding out
about the train.

1264
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:07,115
-Horace!
-Yes, sir.

1265
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:10,902
Did you find out
about the train to Bandero?

1266
01:10:10,945 --> 01:10:12,382
Not yet.

1267
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:18,736
Well, hurry and find out.

1268
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:20,433
Yes, sir.

1269
01:10:21,565 --> 01:10:23,088
Papa?

1270
01:10:24,698 --> 01:10:27,092
Papa, come on out now.

1271
01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:30,226
Did you hear what I said?

1272
01:10:31,705 --> 01:10:33,359
Papa?

1273
01:10:35,448 --> 01:10:38,321
Ruth Amos is learning
a new song.

1274
01:10:38,364 --> 01:10:40,714
Mama said she did so well
at the soldier's benefit,

1275
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:42,020
she's learning a new one

1276
01:10:42,063 --> 01:10:43,804
in case she's asked
to sing again.

1277
01:10:43,848 --> 01:10:45,589
Look here, Bessie.

1278
01:10:47,808 --> 01:10:49,375
Do you like this house?

1279
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:51,551
Yes, I do.

1280
01:10:51,595 --> 01:10:53,510
I got a note today from Papa

1281
01:10:53,553 --> 01:10:55,076
sayin' Mama wanted
to give me a house

1282
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,426
and to call him about it.

1283
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:57,165
And I did.

1284
01:10:58,602 --> 01:11:01,735
And he said she had in mind
a house costin' $4,000,

1285
01:11:01,779 --> 01:11:05,522
which is exactly
what this house costs.

1286
01:11:05,565 --> 01:11:08,002
Bessie, I'm a nervous wreck.

1287
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:13,312
I want a house so badly
to bring the baby to.

1288
01:11:13,356 --> 01:11:15,488
But I don't wanna cross Horace,

1289
01:11:16,881 --> 01:11:18,665
and I don't know
how Horace will feel

1290
01:11:18,709 --> 01:11:21,842
about takin' something like this
from Mama and Papa.

1291
01:11:25,933 --> 01:11:27,587
Did you find your cousin George?

1292
01:11:27,631 --> 01:11:29,110
Yes.

1293
01:11:29,154 --> 01:11:30,373
He's hiding in the woods.

1294
01:11:30,416 --> 01:11:32,897
He wants me to take him
to Bandero.

1295
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:35,813
I don't know how Cousin Sarah

1296
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:38,468
would take his visiting
Aunt Mary's grave.

1297
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,576
This is from Mama.

1298
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:04,015
All she does, poor thing,
is apologize

1299
01:12:04,058 --> 01:12:06,844
for not having gotten us
anything for Christmas.

1300
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:10,891
Well, this came early
this afternoon.

1301
01:12:19,291 --> 01:12:21,467
I called Papa.

1302
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:23,382
I told him you'd saved
almost enough money

1303
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:24,688
to buy us a house.

1304
01:12:24,731 --> 01:12:26,211
He said to tell
you could take that money

1305
01:12:26,254 --> 01:12:28,431
and use it to buy war bonds.

1306
01:12:29,954 --> 01:12:31,434
You think he believed
I had enough money saved

1307
01:12:31,477 --> 01:12:32,391
for a house?

1308
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:33,349
Why shouldn't he?

1309
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:37,614
Did you tell him
you'd accept his gift?

1310
01:12:37,657 --> 01:12:40,225
No. I thanked him,

1311
01:12:40,268 --> 01:12:43,533
but I said I would have
to talk it over with you first.

1312
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:45,535
He said to tell you
it was a gift from Mama

1313
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:46,797
and not from him.

1314
01:12:48,059 --> 01:12:49,800
If you take it, the deed will be
in your name.

1315
01:12:49,843 --> 01:12:51,410
I don't want anyone around here
insinuating

1316
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:52,759
that I married you for a house.

1317
01:12:52,803 --> 01:12:54,413
-Well, who would say that?
-Everyone.

1318
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:57,068
Well, I won't take it, honey,
if you don't want me to.

1319
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,417
Where is the house to be?

1320
01:12:59,940 --> 01:13:01,159
Right behind theirs.

1321
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:04,597
Well, I don't mind
you accepting it

1322
01:13:04,641 --> 01:13:06,556
if you make it clear
it is to be in your name

1323
01:13:06,599 --> 01:13:08,819
and no part of it
to belong to me.

1324
01:13:08,862 --> 01:13:10,386
But it will always be your home.

1325
01:13:10,429 --> 01:13:12,475
I hope you'll always be able
to think of it as your home.

1326
01:13:12,518 --> 01:13:13,606
Well, I'm sure I will.

1327
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:14,781
I just want everyone
to understand

1328
01:13:14,825 --> 01:13:16,217
who the gift was for.

1329
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:17,654
-They meant it for us both.
-No, I don't think so.

1330
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:19,046
It says very clearly here
in the note

1331
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:23,442
that, uh, your mother wishes
to give you a house.

1332
01:13:23,486 --> 01:13:25,662
Horace, please,
don't be sensitive.

1333
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:27,098
Our lives will be miserable
if you are.

1334
01:13:27,141 --> 01:13:28,795
Look, I'm not. Believe me.

1335
01:13:28,839 --> 01:13:30,971
If-- if it had been offered
to both of us,

1336
01:13:31,015 --> 01:13:32,973
I would insist it be
in your name.

1337
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:39,458
Horace.

1338
01:13:39,502 --> 01:13:41,504
Hello, Cousin George.

1339
01:13:43,331 --> 01:13:44,637
This your wife?

1340
01:13:44,681 --> 01:13:46,552
Well, yes, sir. You
know Elizabeth.

1341
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:48,511
Mr. Henry Vaughn's
oldest daughter.

1342
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:51,427
Did you find out
about the train to Bandero?

1343
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:54,430
Oh, yes, sir.
Uh, there's none.

1344
01:13:55,735 --> 01:13:57,171
None at all?

1345
01:13:57,215 --> 01:13:58,477
No, sir. Not from here.

1346
01:13:58,521 --> 01:14:00,000
-It's in the middle of nowhere.
-Man!

1347
01:14:01,959 --> 01:14:04,048
It's all right.

1348
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,532
Too tired to go anyway.

1349
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:12,535
About to fall over,
I'm so tired.

1350
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,885
Been walkin'
through the river bottoms.

1351
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:18,715
This your girl?

1352
01:14:19,890 --> 01:14:22,327
Oh, no, sir.
She lives down the street.

1353
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:24,198
Just a neighbor.

1354
01:14:24,242 --> 01:14:27,593
-Who she belong to?
-The Stillmans.

1355
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:36,254
This your house?

1356
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:38,082
Oh, no, sir.

1357
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,518
This is Mrs. Pate's house.

1358
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:40,954
Where is Mrs. Pate?
I'd like to say hello to her.

1359
01:14:40,998 --> 01:14:42,260
Well, she's not a home.

1360
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:45,219
She's, uh, over in Galveston
with Mr. Bobby.

1361
01:14:45,263 --> 01:14:49,006
He's, uh--
he's taking the Keeley Cure.

1362
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:50,964
Oh.

1363
01:14:51,008 --> 01:14:52,531
Was he drinking again?

1364
01:14:52,575 --> 01:14:54,185
Well, yes, sir.

1365
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:56,709
Ah, that's too bad.

1366
01:14:56,753 --> 01:14:58,581
Daddy drinks, son.

1367
01:14:58,624 --> 01:14:59,886
Yes, sir.

1368
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:02,585
-Killed him.
-Yes, sir.

1369
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,634
How's your mother?

1370
01:15:09,722 --> 01:15:10,854
She's well.

1371
01:15:12,029 --> 01:15:13,944
Father sent for me
just before he died.

1372
01:15:13,987 --> 01:15:15,467
-I ever tell you this?
-No, sir.

1373
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,816
Yeah.

1374
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,515
He said,
"George, I'm gonna die.

1375
01:15:22,953 --> 01:15:24,911
Promise me
you'll look after my children.

1376
01:15:24,955 --> 01:15:27,740
Promise me you'll never
let them go hungry."

1377
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:33,572
Well, didn't keep my promise.

1378
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:34,878
I'm sorry.

1379
01:15:34,921 --> 01:15:37,402
Didn't keep my promise
about a lot of things.

1380
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:44,670
You say Mary's dead.

1381
01:15:45,497 --> 01:15:46,846
Yes, sir.

1382
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:49,283
They won't let me die.

1383
01:15:49,327 --> 01:15:50,850
I wanna die.

1384
01:15:50,894 --> 01:15:53,026
They've been chasin' me
all through the river bottoms.

1385
01:15:53,070 --> 01:15:54,637
They give me no peace.

1386
01:15:56,464 --> 01:15:58,249
First they wanna kill me.

1387
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:00,251
My own wife tried to poison me.

1388
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:03,559
And then, when I wanna
take my own life,

1389
01:16:03,602 --> 01:16:05,517
they do all in their power
to stop me.

1390
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:11,218
I've had a difficult life
since I betrayed Mary.

1391
01:16:11,262 --> 01:16:13,090
I've had no happiness.

1392
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:18,443
I've been punished unmercifully
for what I done.

1393
01:16:20,097 --> 01:16:22,708
-You know the way to my home?
-Yes, sir.

1394
01:16:22,752 --> 01:16:24,667
Will you take me there?
I'm very confused.

1395
01:16:24,710 --> 01:16:27,495
-Tried to get there twice.
-Yes, sir.

1396
01:16:32,326 --> 01:16:34,894
How old was Mary when she died?

1397
01:16:34,938 --> 01:16:36,679
She was 40.

1398
01:16:38,942 --> 01:16:43,337
She had long, blonde hair
when I last saw her.

1399
01:16:43,381 --> 01:16:44,425
Did she when she died?

1400
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:47,124
I believe so.

1401
01:16:47,167 --> 01:16:49,735
I married her cousin
from Kentucky.

1402
01:16:49,779 --> 01:16:51,998
Now, what the hell's her name?

1403
01:16:52,042 --> 01:16:53,130
Sarah.

1404
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:56,133
Sarah, yeah. Sarah.

1405
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:06,839
Are you the son I had by Mary?

1406
01:17:09,102 --> 01:17:10,626
No, sir.

1407
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:14,238
Where's the son I had by Mary?

1408
01:17:16,196 --> 01:17:19,199
I don't believe you had one
by Mary, sir.

1409
01:17:19,243 --> 01:17:21,549
-I didn't?
-No, sir.

1410
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:24,552
-I have children.
-Oh, yes, sir. You've got four.

1411
01:17:26,554 --> 01:17:28,644
Mary ever have children?

1412
01:17:28,687 --> 01:17:30,515
No, she didn't.

1413
01:17:30,558 --> 01:17:32,604
Poor Mary,
dyin' without children.

1414
01:17:34,519 --> 01:17:36,434
They think I'm crazy, you know.

1415
01:17:36,477 --> 01:17:38,871
I do get terrible headaches.

1416
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:42,048
I can't think then.

1417
01:17:42,962 --> 01:17:45,225
But I wouldn't harm anybody.

1418
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:48,794
Once I tried to kill Sarah.

1419
01:17:50,143 --> 01:17:51,188
I didn't mean it.

1420
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:52,842
I don't know what I did.

1421
01:17:53,973 --> 01:17:55,627
Took a butcher knife
on Christmas Eve,

1422
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,324
chased her all around the house.

1423
01:17:57,368 --> 01:17:59,370
Yow!

1424
01:17:59,413 --> 01:18:02,590
I'm glad I didn't kill her.
I'd have been sorry if I had.

1425
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:09,162
I need help, but nobody here
can help me.

1426
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:14,167
Gonna go out there now.

1427
01:18:15,299 --> 01:18:17,780
And I want you to go with me,
son.

1428
01:18:20,521 --> 01:18:23,307
I want you to tell 'em for me
I need help.

1429
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:27,050
And if I can't get it,
I want them to kill me.

1430
01:18:27,093 --> 01:18:29,356
'Cause I don't wanna go on
like this.

1431
01:18:30,531 --> 01:18:31,576
You tell 'em that for me?

1432
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:35,362
Yes, sir. I will.

1433
01:18:36,624 --> 01:18:38,148
Let's go.

1434
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:44,545
Can you see them, Bessie?

1435
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,507
Yes, ma'am.
They're on the porch.

1436
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:52,249
Are they talkin' together?

1437
01:18:57,907 --> 01:18:59,386
Were you scared of him, Mary?

1438
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:02,694
I don't know.
It all happened so quickly.

1439
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:06,654
Was that Mr. George
I saw with Horace?

1440
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:08,526
Yes, sir.

1441
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:11,790
What is it, Lizzie?
You're trembling.

1442
01:19:11,834 --> 01:19:13,313
Is Horace in danger?

1443
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:15,881
No, sir. I don't think so.

1444
01:19:15,925 --> 01:19:17,187
Oh, Papa.

1445
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:19,885
Mr. George Tyler is so pitiful.

1446
01:19:19,929 --> 01:19:21,452
He doesn't even know
who his own wife is

1447
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:23,062
half the time.

1448
01:19:24,847 --> 01:19:27,110
You love your husband,
don't you?

1449
01:19:27,153 --> 01:19:29,155
Yes, I do.

1450
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,505
Mary, I'm goin' home.

1451
01:19:31,549 --> 01:19:34,378
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Bessie.

1452
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:39,731
I wonder
how he got past the sheriff

1453
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,777
and the others in the bottom
and got in here.

1454
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:45,041
He told Horace
he wanted to get back home.

1455
01:19:45,084 --> 01:19:49,175
All he wants to do is talk
about Horace's Aunt Mary.

1456
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:51,438
-Were they in love, Papa?
-Oh, God knows.

1457
01:19:51,482 --> 01:19:53,876
That must have been
30 years ago at least.

1458
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:57,488
Anyway, he's had four children
by poor Miss Sarah.

1459
01:19:57,531 --> 01:19:58,837
I expect she wanted to go

1460
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,491
running through
the river bottoms many a time.

1461
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:05,278
These the plans
for the new house?

1462
01:20:08,847 --> 01:20:12,372
I got your brother's mid-term
report card today from college.

1463
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:13,025
It's just terrible.

1464
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,160
I've never seen such grades.
What am I gonna do with him?

1465
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:22,469
You say you can get this built
for $4,000?

1466
01:20:22,513 --> 01:20:23,862
Yes, sir.

1467
01:20:23,906 --> 01:20:26,169
You mind if I take it with me
and study it some?

1468
01:20:26,212 --> 01:20:28,127
No, sir.

1469
01:20:28,171 --> 01:20:31,522
You have a chance
to speak to Horace?

1470
01:20:31,565 --> 01:20:33,829
Yes, sir. He says
it's all right with him

1471
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:35,700
as long as the house is--
is put in my name.

1472
01:20:37,136 --> 01:20:38,398
He doesn't want anyone here
thinking

1473
01:20:38,442 --> 01:20:40,618
he is taking help from you.

1474
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:43,055
I think he's awfully sensitive.

1475
01:20:46,363 --> 01:20:48,539
He still thinks
that you don't like him, Papa.

1476
01:20:48,582 --> 01:20:51,150
Oh, I like him all right,
Elizabeth. Give me time.

1477
01:20:51,194 --> 01:20:53,283
These things take time.

1478
01:20:55,676 --> 01:20:58,331
I sometimes think I should take
your brother out of college,

1479
01:20:58,375 --> 01:20:59,767
put him on one of the farms.

1480
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:01,639
Let him learn
how difficult it is

1481
01:21:01,682 --> 01:21:03,423
for an uneducated man
to earn a living.

1482
01:21:03,467 --> 01:21:05,643
I was determined
not to raise him

1483
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:06,992
as a rich man's son.

1484
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:09,168
But he has no ambition. None.

1485
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:11,301
And I hate to say this
about my own child,

1486
01:21:11,344 --> 01:21:13,433
but he's a terrible liar.

1487
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:14,913
You know that bet
with Bobby Pate

1488
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:17,524
that he says was for $2
and still swears it was?

1489
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:20,223
Well, Bobby was right.
It was for $40.

1490
01:21:20,266 --> 01:21:22,529
There were
four reliable witnesses

1491
01:21:22,573 --> 01:21:23,966
that heard him make that bet.

1492
01:21:24,009 --> 01:21:26,359
So, I sent Bobby a check
for $40 today.

1493
01:21:26,403 --> 01:21:28,013
Well, maybe that's a mistake.

1494
01:21:28,057 --> 01:21:29,928
Maybe if he had to pay back
that money himself--

1495
01:21:29,972 --> 01:21:32,583
Where's he gonna get $40
goin' to A&M College?

1496
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:34,019
No. I paid it.

1497
01:21:34,063 --> 01:21:35,847
And I'll see to it that he works
around the house,

1498
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,588
around the farm,
until I'm paid back.

1499
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,593
You know
I'm not a very sociable man.

1500
01:21:42,636 --> 01:21:44,464
It isn't just with Horace.

1501
01:21:44,508 --> 01:21:47,076
I don't have an easy time
talking with my own son.

1502
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:48,381
Yes, sir.

1503
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:52,342
You see, Horace's father died
when he was 12.

1504
01:21:52,385 --> 01:21:54,518
Well, I was 12
when my father died.

1505
01:21:54,561 --> 01:21:57,390
I went to work soon after.
I put myself through college.

1506
01:21:57,434 --> 01:21:58,957
I realize that, Papa.

1507
01:21:59,001 --> 01:22:02,656
I haven't stopped working
for a second, since I was 12.

1508
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,268
I resented Horace,
I resented him very much,

1509
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:06,356
coming into my home--

1510
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,711
But I'll get over it.

1511
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:16,409
Time heals all that.

1512
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:22,807
Oh, honey,
I'm so glad you're back.

1513
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,940
I was worryin'.

1514
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:26,419
Did he go on home?

1515
01:22:27,029 --> 01:22:28,160
I don't know.

1516
01:22:28,204 --> 01:22:29,814
I only walked halfway with him

1517
01:22:29,857 --> 01:22:32,077
when Steve and the sheriff
drove up.

1518
01:22:32,121 --> 01:22:34,775
And Steve got out of the car
and came over to us,

1519
01:22:34,819 --> 01:22:37,604
told Cousin George
he was gonna take him home.

1520
01:22:37,648 --> 01:22:39,258
I didn't think Cousin George
would go at first,

1521
01:22:39,302 --> 01:22:43,784
but finally, he did, and got
in the car and drove away.

1522
01:22:43,828 --> 01:22:46,396
I don't know
where they'll take him.

1523
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:47,963
Oh.

1524
01:22:48,006 --> 01:22:49,442
You know,
it all happened so quickly,

1525
01:22:49,486 --> 01:22:50,922
I forgot to tell Steve

1526
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:53,359
what Cousin George asked me to
about his needing help.

1527
01:22:53,403 --> 01:22:55,448
My God, you don't have to tell
anybody that.

1528
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:57,668
He's needed help for years.
Who could help him?

1529
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:02,803
I showed Papa the--
the plans for the house.

1530
01:23:02,847 --> 01:23:04,936
Uh, he's taking them home
with him to study them.

1531
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,633
By tomorrow or the next day,
I'll drive you out

1532
01:23:06,677 --> 01:23:10,246
and show you where your two lots
are to be and your new road.

1533
01:23:10,289 --> 01:23:13,466
I'll show you where I think
you should plant some trees.

1534
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:15,033
Lizzie.

1535
01:23:35,358 --> 01:23:36,707
Where you goin'?

1536
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:38,100
I'm going to get you something
for your headache.

1537
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:39,362
No, I'll get it myself.

1538
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:41,059
You rest now.
You've had a rough mornin'.

1539
01:23:41,103 --> 01:23:42,495
No, I'm goin' with you.

1540
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:44,367
Want to be sure
what you're givin' me.

1541
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:45,498
Might be trying to poison me.

1542
01:23:50,982 --> 01:23:54,203
You can do a great deal
on two lots.

1543
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:59,730
You can have all the trees
that you want.

1544
01:23:59,773 --> 01:24:01,993
And you can have chickens.

1545
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:12,830
I can feel the baby movin'.

1546
01:24:14,397 --> 01:24:16,051
Can you feel it?

1547
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:20,055
Oh. Yes.

1548
01:24:29,847 --> 01:24:32,067
When I was three years old,

1549
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:36,419
my baby sister Jenny died
with diphtheria.

1550
01:24:39,770 --> 01:24:42,512
Mama was pregnant then,

1551
01:24:42,555 --> 01:24:45,863
and they had her
in bed restin',

1552
01:24:45,906 --> 01:24:50,650
and Papa's sisters from Brazoria
came to stay with us.

1553
01:24:50,694 --> 01:24:53,479
And one of them took me
in her arms

1554
01:24:53,523 --> 01:24:55,046
and showed me Jenny
in her coffin,

1555
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:57,092
and I got hysterical.

1556
01:24:59,529 --> 01:25:01,835
I fought to get away,
and I raised such a commotion

1557
01:25:01,879 --> 01:25:03,663
Papa ran in,

1558
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:08,146
and his sister told him
he had an unnatural child...

1559
01:25:08,190 --> 01:25:10,540
...that refused to look
at her own dead sister.

1560
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:18,243
Mama doesn't even have
a picture of Jenny any longer

1561
01:25:18,287 --> 01:25:20,245
where you can see it.

1562
01:25:22,943 --> 01:25:26,077
It's hidden away at the bottom
of her cedar chest.

1563
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,740
Papa. Papa.

1564
01:25:38,307 --> 01:25:39,873
Papa.

1565
01:25:42,006 --> 01:25:42,876
Papa.

1566
01:25:46,619 --> 01:25:48,012
Papa?

1567
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:51,711
Papa!

1568
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:54,192
Papa!

1569
01:25:54,236 --> 01:25:55,628
Papa!

1570
01:25:55,672 --> 01:25:56,977
Papa?

1571
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:09,642
When I was five
and Laura was two,

1572
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:13,907
I told her I wanted to show her
where our dead sister was.

1573
01:26:13,951 --> 01:26:16,345
And Mr. Billy Lee,

1574
01:26:18,825 --> 01:26:20,871
a friend of Papa's,

1575
01:26:21,872 --> 01:26:24,918
saw us walkin' down the road,

1576
01:26:24,962 --> 01:26:27,094
and he asked
where we were goin'.

1577
01:26:28,574 --> 01:26:32,361
And I said,
"Lookin' for our dead sister."

1578
01:26:32,404 --> 01:26:35,233
And he said,
"You can't find her."

1579
01:26:35,277 --> 01:26:37,757
And I said, "Why not?"

1580
01:26:37,801 --> 01:26:41,718
And he said, "Because she's
not there, she's in heaven."

1581
01:26:41,761 --> 01:26:43,546
And I said, "No, she's not.

1582
01:26:43,589 --> 01:26:47,114
She's shut up in a box
and buried in a graveyard."

1583
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:50,248
And he took us both,
and he put us on his horse,

1584
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:53,773
and he took us
out to the graveyard,

1585
01:26:53,817 --> 01:26:57,560
and we found her little grave
with that lamb on it.

1586
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:05,045
He said, "She's not in there.
She's in heaven."

1587
01:27:05,089 --> 01:27:06,699
And I said,
"Who's in there, then?"

1588
01:27:06,743 --> 01:27:08,266
And he said, "No one."

1589
01:27:09,659 --> 01:27:13,053
"Well," I said,
"How did she get out of there?"

1590
01:27:13,097 --> 01:27:18,102
And he said,
"God took her home with Him."

1591
01:27:37,164 --> 01:27:39,906
Mary! Mary!

1592
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:42,039
What is it, Bessie?

1593
01:27:42,082 --> 01:27:43,649
Mr. George Tyler.

1594
01:27:43,693 --> 01:27:45,085
Mr. George Tyler
got away from them

1595
01:27:45,129 --> 01:27:46,435
when they were
takin' him out of the car.

1596
01:27:46,478 --> 01:27:48,219
He started runnin' back
towards the river,

1597
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,264
and then, he stopped.

1598
01:27:50,395 --> 01:27:52,745
-What? Did they catch him?
-No, sir.

1599
01:27:52,789 --> 01:27:54,704
He took out a knife
and stabbed himself

1600
01:27:54,747 --> 01:27:55,879
before they could get to him.

1601
01:27:55,922 --> 01:27:57,054
Oh, my God!

1602
01:27:57,097 --> 01:27:59,012
He was dead by the time
they got to him.

1603
01:27:59,056 --> 01:28:02,102
And I saw Mr. Bobby
down there, too. He's drunk.

1604
01:28:02,146 --> 01:28:04,409
Mama said that he slipped away
from his mother in Galveston

1605
01:28:04,453 --> 01:28:06,759
and got drunk
and came on back here.

1606
01:28:06,803 --> 01:28:10,720
Mrs. Pate's comin' home tonight
on the 11:00 train.

1607
01:28:10,763 --> 01:28:12,069
Well, I better get over,

1608
01:28:12,112 --> 01:28:13,592
see if I can be
of any help to Sarah.

1609
01:28:13,636 --> 01:28:15,246
Well, what about your supper?

1610
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:16,900
Well, I'll get something uptown.

1611
01:28:16,943 --> 01:28:19,163
You go on and have something
by yourself.

1612
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:27,780
Horace!

1613
01:28:27,824 --> 01:28:28,999
Come back!

1614
01:28:29,042 --> 01:28:30,957
Don't leave me!

1615
01:28:31,001 --> 01:28:32,698
-Did he hear you?
-No.

1616
01:28:32,742 --> 01:28:34,221
Do you want me
to go fetch him back?

1617
01:28:34,265 --> 01:28:35,048
No.

1618
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:39,966
I told Mama about Miss Mary
being buried in Bandero, Texas,

1619
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:42,969
and she said it was Junction
as near as she could remember.

1620
01:28:43,013 --> 01:28:46,321
She says it's just as desolate
out there.

1621
01:28:46,364 --> 01:28:48,148
Do you think they'll bury him
out there next to Miss Mary?

1622
01:28:48,192 --> 01:28:49,759
I doubt it.

1623
01:28:49,802 --> 01:28:50,977
Will they bury him here?

1624
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:52,675
I don't know.

1625
01:28:55,678 --> 01:28:58,158
Aren't you gonna go out
and get your supper?

1626
01:28:58,202 --> 01:29:01,988
No. Not tonight.
I'm not hungry now.

1627
01:29:03,468 --> 01:29:06,384
Are you mad at Horace
'cause he went off without you?

1628
01:29:06,428 --> 01:29:08,517
No.

1629
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:10,910
You're upset about something,
though, aren't you?

1630
01:29:10,954 --> 01:29:12,521
Yes.

1631
01:29:13,565 --> 01:29:14,697
Mr. George Tyler,

1632
01:29:14,740 --> 01:29:16,916
I can't believe
he was just here,

1633
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:17,743
and now...

1634
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:21,791
You'll be married a year
on Valentine's Day.

1635
01:29:21,834 --> 01:29:23,488
Are you glad
you married Horace?

1636
01:29:23,532 --> 01:29:24,707
Yes, I am.

1637
01:29:26,317 --> 01:29:28,885
Do you love him now as much
as when you first married him?

1638
01:29:28,928 --> 01:29:30,843
Yes, I do.

1639
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:32,932
Do you think in 25 years

1640
01:29:32,976 --> 01:29:35,108
you'll still love him
as much as you do now?

1641
01:29:35,152 --> 01:29:37,197
Yes.

1642
01:29:37,241 --> 01:29:39,112
Do you think he'll still
love you as much then?

1643
01:29:39,156 --> 01:29:41,376
Oh, I hope so.

1644
01:29:41,419 --> 01:29:43,987
-More?
-More.

1645
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:45,380
What about in 50 years?

1646
01:29:45,423 --> 01:29:47,425
Do you think you'll still
love each other then?

1647
01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:48,470
If you're still alive.

1648
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:51,255
You could both be dead
in 50 years.

1649
01:29:51,298 --> 01:29:54,345
How old will you be when you've
been married for 50 years?

1650
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:56,956
Seventy-four.

1651
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,828
And Horace?

1652
01:29:58,871 --> 01:30:01,047
Seventy-seven.

1653
01:30:01,091 --> 01:30:04,094
You'll have gray hair then
unless you dye it.

1654
01:30:04,137 --> 01:30:06,052
Yes.

1655
01:30:06,096 --> 01:30:09,273
And my baby will be 49.

1656
01:30:09,316 --> 01:30:11,580
And you'll have grandchildren.

1657
01:30:11,623 --> 01:30:14,147
And maybe even
great-grandchildren.

1658
01:30:16,933 --> 01:30:19,239
What's the matter?

1659
01:30:19,283 --> 01:30:22,155
I don't wanna get old, Bessie.

1660
01:30:24,027 --> 01:30:27,465
And I don't want Horace
to get old.

1661
01:30:27,509 --> 01:30:30,903
I want everything to stay
just as it is.

1662
01:30:32,252 --> 01:30:34,994
When I'm 74,
Mama and Papa will be dead,

1663
01:30:35,038 --> 01:30:36,300
unless they live to be 100,

1664
01:30:36,343 --> 01:30:39,129
and I don't want anybody I love
to die.

1665
01:30:39,172 --> 01:30:40,870
Not Horace...

1666
01:30:41,871 --> 01:30:44,917
Not Mama, not Papa.

1667
01:30:44,961 --> 01:30:46,528
Not my brother, not my sisters,

1668
01:30:46,571 --> 01:30:49,052
and not the baby
I'm gonna have.

1669
01:30:49,095 --> 01:30:50,488
What about me?

1670
01:30:50,532 --> 01:30:51,794
Do you want me to die?

1671
01:30:51,837 --> 01:30:53,491
Oh, no, I don't.

1672
01:30:53,535 --> 01:30:55,928
I don't want you ever to die.

1673
01:32:13,876 --> 01:32:17,009
I'm sorry, uh, ladies,
for not knockin'.

1674
01:32:17,053 --> 01:32:19,185
I forgot this room was rented.

1675
01:32:19,229 --> 01:32:21,361
This used to be the parlor.

1676
01:32:26,889 --> 01:32:31,415
I, uh-- I had a lovely time
in Galveston.

1677
01:32:31,458 --> 01:32:33,896
It was-- it was a little cool
for bathing,

1678
01:32:33,939 --> 01:32:37,029
but on sunny days,
we sat on the boardwalk

1679
01:32:37,073 --> 01:32:39,249
and enjoyed the sunshine.

1680
01:32:40,163 --> 01:32:42,078
My mother sends her regards.

1681
01:32:45,734 --> 01:32:47,431
-Oh, hello, Horace.
-Hello, Bobby.

1682
01:32:47,474 --> 01:32:49,607
Hey, did you hear
about Mr. George Tyler?

1683
01:32:49,651 --> 01:32:50,739
He took a knife

1684
01:32:50,782 --> 01:32:52,218
and he stabbed himself
in the heart.

1685
01:32:52,262 --> 01:32:53,872
You were kin to Mr. George,
weren't you?

1686
01:32:53,916 --> 01:32:55,134
Yes, by marriage.

1687
01:32:55,178 --> 01:32:56,919
Bessie, I-I passed your mother.

1688
01:32:56,962 --> 01:32:58,398
She said you were
to come on home.

1689
01:32:58,442 --> 01:33:00,139
Yes, sir.

1690
01:33:00,705 --> 01:33:02,315
I, uh--

1691
01:33:02,359 --> 01:33:06,624
I wanna show you good people
a check that I got today.

1692
01:33:06,668 --> 01:33:08,147
It's for $40.

1693
01:33:08,191 --> 01:33:11,063
It's from Mr. Henry Vaughn,
and it's in payment for--

1694
01:33:11,107 --> 01:33:13,631
We know all about that, Bobby.
We know all about that.

1695
01:33:18,070 --> 01:33:21,683
When Miss Ruth, uh,
sang at the soldier's benefit,

1696
01:33:21,726 --> 01:33:25,164
they announced her
as the Songbird of the South.

1697
01:33:28,385 --> 01:33:30,605
Did you go to Miss Sarah's?

1698
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:33,216
Yes. Steve said there wasn't
anything I could do.

1699
01:33:33,259 --> 01:33:36,262
He said they have had
Cousin Sarah under sedation

1700
01:33:36,306 --> 01:33:39,657
ever since Mr. George ran away.

1701
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:41,485
He said she wouldn't see
anybody.

1702
01:33:42,704 --> 01:33:46,316
Sheriff said Cousin George
wasn't quite dead

1703
01:33:46,359 --> 01:33:47,752
when he got to him.

1704
01:33:48,666 --> 01:33:50,755
He said he had asked for me.

1705
01:33:52,931 --> 01:33:56,369
He said he had promised my daddy
he'd look out for me.

1706
01:34:06,641 --> 01:34:09,078
-You heard about Mr. George?
-Yes.

1707
01:34:09,121 --> 01:34:11,080
It's just terrible, isn't it?

1708
01:34:11,123 --> 01:34:13,125
Yes, it is.

1709
01:34:13,169 --> 01:34:14,692
It's terrible.

1710
01:34:15,475 --> 01:34:17,826
It's terrible. Terrible.

1711
01:34:23,048 --> 01:34:24,093
I brought some books over

1712
01:34:24,136 --> 01:34:25,747
I thought you should have,
Horace.

1713
01:34:25,790 --> 01:34:30,665
Some volumes of Bulwer-Lytton
and Thackery, Wilkie Collins.

1714
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:32,014
They belonged to your father,
I believe.

1715
01:34:32,057 --> 01:34:34,538
He had his name written in 'em.

1716
01:34:34,581 --> 01:34:37,019
I got them years before
from Senator Dockery.

1717
01:34:39,282 --> 01:34:40,979
I said to my wife
the other night,

1718
01:34:41,023 --> 01:34:44,200
"I... I think Horace
should have them."

1719
01:34:45,636 --> 01:34:48,465
Oh, well, thank you, sir.

1720
01:34:57,561 --> 01:34:59,694
Elizabeth says you think
I don't like you.

1721
01:34:59,737 --> 01:35:02,305
Papa, I never said
he told me that.

1722
01:35:02,348 --> 01:35:04,699
I only said I felt
he felt that way.

1723
01:35:04,742 --> 01:35:06,483
Well, I do like you.

1724
01:35:06,526 --> 01:35:10,008
And I respect you, and--

1725
01:35:11,531 --> 01:35:12,837
Well, I hear you've been
over to the bank

1726
01:35:12,881 --> 01:35:14,534
about a loan
for opening a store.

1727
01:35:14,578 --> 01:35:17,494
Yes, sir, but, uh,
I won't need their help now.

1728
01:35:17,537 --> 01:35:19,670
I can use the money I have been
saving to buy a house.

1729
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:21,541
Well, I don't want you to spend
all the money you save.

1730
01:35:21,585 --> 01:35:23,674
Now, let me loan you the money
to help you get started,

1731
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,328
and you can take whatever
you have saved

1732
01:35:25,371 --> 01:35:26,633
and buy liberty bonds.

1733
01:35:26,677 --> 01:35:28,592
That way you'll be helping
your country, too.

1734
01:35:28,635 --> 01:35:30,159
I can let you have the money
for your business,

1735
01:35:30,202 --> 01:35:31,551
no interest at all,

1736
01:35:31,595 --> 01:35:33,118
and you can pay me back
whenever it's convenient.

1737
01:35:33,162 --> 01:35:34,250
Well, yes sir, thank you, sir.

1738
01:35:34,293 --> 01:35:35,468
I appreciate it,
but I can't accept it.

1739
01:35:35,512 --> 01:35:36,556
Well, I want to help.

1740
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:37,775
You've done enough for us
already.

1741
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:40,778
Thank you, sir,
but, uh, I can't let you.

1742
01:35:43,389 --> 01:35:45,870
-Well, if you change your mind.
-Thank you.

1743
01:35:50,527 --> 01:35:52,834
You know, I think
an unhappy marriage

1744
01:35:52,877 --> 01:35:54,487
is the worst thing in the world.

1745
01:35:54,531 --> 01:35:57,795
I'm happily married, thank God,
and I trust you will be.

1746
01:35:57,839 --> 01:35:59,188
Like I said to Mrs. Vaughn

1747
01:35:59,231 --> 01:36:02,365
when Elizabeth asked
about marrying you, I said--

1748
01:36:06,151 --> 01:36:09,720
Well, um, that's all water
over the dam, isn't it?

1749
01:36:09,764 --> 01:36:12,549
All water over the dam.

1750
01:36:13,942 --> 01:36:15,726
Everyone says to me,
"Poor Horace.

1751
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:17,728
Never had a father."

1752
01:36:17,772 --> 01:36:21,210
Well, like I told Elizabeth,
I never had a father either.

1753
01:36:22,864 --> 01:36:24,082
And now, I have no son.

1754
01:36:25,257 --> 01:36:26,563
I'll hate myself tomorrow
for saying this,

1755
01:36:26,606 --> 01:36:29,348
but God forgive me,
I have no son at all.

1756
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:31,698
He's a stranger to me.

1757
01:36:31,742 --> 01:36:33,918
I don't know which way to turn.

1758
01:36:43,493 --> 01:36:46,757
There's peace in this room
and contentment.

1759
01:36:46,801 --> 01:36:48,280
That's why I like to come here,
I think.

1760
01:36:49,891 --> 01:36:51,718
I said to Mrs. Vaughn
the other night,

1761
01:36:51,762 --> 01:36:54,721
"They don't have much,
but they're contented.

1762
01:36:54,765 --> 01:36:56,375
You feel that."

1763
01:36:57,942 --> 01:37:01,032
I hope you find contentment
in your new home.

1764
01:37:01,076 --> 01:37:02,860
I'd buy that for you if I could,

1765
01:37:02,904 --> 01:37:06,081
but things like that
can't be bought.

1766
01:37:10,215 --> 01:37:12,609
Uh, Miss Ruth's in her room,
cryin'.

1767
01:37:12,652 --> 01:37:15,655
And I asked her what was wrong,
she said her heart was broke.

1768
01:37:15,699 --> 01:37:17,092
Do you think
I should go see about it?

1769
01:37:17,135 --> 01:37:18,049
Oh, I don't know. I--

1770
01:37:18,093 --> 01:37:19,834
I explained to Miss Ruth, uh,

1771
01:37:19,877 --> 01:37:22,140
that I was still married
to a lovely girl

1772
01:37:22,184 --> 01:37:23,272
in the sight of God.

1773
01:37:23,315 --> 01:37:24,969
Elizabeth, I, uh--

1774
01:37:25,013 --> 01:37:28,538
Oh. Excuse me.
I didn't know you had guests.

1775
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:29,974
Come in, Miss Ruth.

1776
01:37:30,018 --> 01:37:31,497
I'm not staying long.

1777
01:37:31,541 --> 01:37:34,022
Mrs. Vaughn is coming in
on a Houston train.

1778
01:37:34,065 --> 01:37:36,154
-Oh, oh.
-Sit down.

1779
01:37:36,198 --> 01:37:40,158
Uh, it's, uh, too bad
about Mr. George, isn't it?

1780
01:37:40,202 --> 01:37:41,681
Oh, yes.

1781
01:37:43,379 --> 01:37:46,948
Oh, I just heard
about your new house.

1782
01:37:46,991 --> 01:37:50,255
Uh, did you hear about
their new house, Mr. Bobby?

1783
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:54,825
Uh, well,
they'll be leavin' us soon.

1784
01:37:54,869 --> 01:37:58,916
Well, we'll miss
Horace and Elizabeth,

1785
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,614
won't we, Mr. Bobby?

1786
01:38:01,658 --> 01:38:04,182
They had to elope
to get married, you know?

1787
01:38:04,226 --> 01:38:06,054
Uh, Elizabeth's
mother and father--

1788
01:38:06,097 --> 01:38:09,057
That's all in the past now,
Mr. Bobby.

1789
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:12,930
Everybody has forgiven
everybody now.

1790
01:38:12,974 --> 01:38:15,498
Papa is givin' us
this lovely new house.

1791
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:17,369
Oh, that's nice to hear.

1792
01:38:17,413 --> 01:38:20,938
I'm always happy
when things turn out well.

1793
01:38:20,982 --> 01:38:23,288
When did you all
forgive each other?

1794
01:38:23,332 --> 01:38:24,768
Last Christmas.

1795
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:27,031
Oh, in this very room.

1796
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:30,426
Uh, how long
have you been married?

1797
01:38:30,469 --> 01:38:33,385
It will be a year
Valentine's Day.

1798
01:38:33,429 --> 01:38:35,387
They're, uh--
they're a very happy couple.

1799
01:38:35,431 --> 01:38:38,260
Uh, you know, I-I remarked
to Mama the other day,

1800
01:38:38,303 --> 01:38:41,959
I said, uh, "I believe that's
one marriage that'll take."

1801
01:38:42,003 --> 01:38:45,180
I remember the day
Horace eloped.

1802
01:38:45,223 --> 01:38:47,269
It was Easter.
Easter Sunday.

1803
01:38:47,312 --> 01:38:50,489
No, no, Mr. Bobby.
It was Valentine's Day.

1804
01:38:50,533 --> 01:38:52,013
Ah.

1805
01:38:52,056 --> 01:38:56,060
Y'all have a family, uh, plot
reserved at the graveyard?

1806
01:38:56,104 --> 01:38:58,802
I told Mama the other night,
"We don't have a family plot.

1807
01:38:58,845 --> 01:39:00,108
We have to get one,

1808
01:39:00,151 --> 01:39:02,849
'cause I want us together
even in death."

1809
01:39:02,893 --> 01:39:06,418
Miss Ruth, uh, here's the house
we're giving the children.

1810
01:39:06,462 --> 01:39:07,463
We hope to have it ready

1811
01:39:07,506 --> 01:39:09,856
soon after
their new baby is born.

1812
01:39:11,380 --> 01:39:14,861
Mr. Billy Lee was by my office
this afternoon, Elizabeth.

1813
01:39:14,905 --> 01:39:17,516
He was remembering the time
he found you and Laura

1814
01:39:17,560 --> 01:39:20,519
lookin' for the graveyard
to see Jenny's grave.

1815
01:39:20,563 --> 01:39:22,347
This is gonna be lovely.

1816
01:39:23,696 --> 01:39:26,873
Hey. Mr. Billy Lee's oldest boy
was a sissy.

1817
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:28,658
He had a lovely singin' voice,
though.

1818
01:39:28,701 --> 01:39:30,921
It was very high. A tenor.

1819
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:33,968
Uh, he dresses up
in girls' clothes.

1820
01:39:34,011 --> 01:39:36,492
Mr. Billy says he whips
the devil out of him

1821
01:39:36,535 --> 01:39:37,928
every time
he catches him doin' it,

1822
01:39:37,972 --> 01:39:39,277
but he can't break him.

1823
01:39:42,193 --> 01:39:44,891
Jenny would've been 22
if she had lived.

1824
01:39:44,935 --> 01:39:48,330
Twenty-three.
Her birthday was last week.

1825
01:39:48,373 --> 01:39:49,940
Jenny was frail from the start.

1826
01:39:49,984 --> 01:39:53,117
You were always healthy,
Elizabeth.

1827
01:39:53,161 --> 01:39:57,774
Well, that's how it goes.
One lives and one dies.

1828
01:39:57,817 --> 01:40:02,344
That Valentine's Day,
uh, the whole town was excited.

1829
01:40:02,387 --> 01:40:04,041
Everyplace you went,
that's all they talked about

1830
01:40:04,085 --> 01:40:05,825
was Horace and Elizabeth
eloping.

1831
01:40:05,869 --> 01:40:08,611
It, uh-- it was romantic.

1832
01:40:08,654 --> 01:40:11,135
It was a warm and lovely day.
You remember?

1833
01:40:11,179 --> 01:40:14,051
No, Mr. Bobby.
It was cold and windy.

1834
01:40:14,095 --> 01:40:15,966
♪ Oh, promise me

1835
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:17,968
Was it a large wedding?

1836
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,361
No.

1837
01:40:19,404 --> 01:40:23,582
Just Allie, and Hector,
and the Baptist preacher--

1838
01:40:23,626 --> 01:40:26,063
And I was there.

1839
01:40:26,107 --> 01:40:29,284
I sang "Oh Promise Me"

1840
01:40:29,327 --> 01:40:32,374
as they walked across the room
to face the preacher.

1841
01:40:34,071 --> 01:40:39,163
Betty Norton carried a few roses
we had picked in Allie's yard.

1842
01:40:39,207 --> 01:40:41,557
I began to cry
in the middle of the ceremony,

1843
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,603
and I think Horace thought
I was sorry we were marryin'.

1844
01:40:44,647 --> 01:40:46,736
Why were you cryin'?

1845
01:40:46,779 --> 01:40:48,085
I don't know.

1846
01:40:52,394 --> 01:40:54,918
What kind of flowers
did you say the Norton girl

1847
01:40:54,961 --> 01:40:56,137
carried at your wedding?

1848
01:40:56,180 --> 01:40:57,660
Roses.

1849
01:40:57,703 --> 01:40:59,966
Your Mama planted
sweetheart roses last fall

1850
01:41:00,010 --> 01:41:02,099
next to Jenny's grave.

1851
01:41:02,143 --> 01:41:04,362
She planted a red rose
by Jenny's grave

1852
01:41:04,406 --> 01:41:06,669
and a pink one by Daisy's.

1853
01:41:14,590 --> 01:41:15,721
Have any of you heard

1854
01:41:15,765 --> 01:41:18,550
when Mr. George Tyler's funeral
will be?

1855
01:41:18,594 --> 01:41:20,683
I'm sure it won't be
for a few days.

1856
01:41:20,726 --> 01:41:22,380
He's got relatives
all over the state,

1857
01:41:22,424 --> 01:41:25,992
and, uh, they'll wanna be sure
to give them time to get here.

1858
01:41:26,036 --> 01:41:30,345
Mama saw Mr. Billy Lee
whip Edgar once.

1859
01:41:32,521 --> 01:41:35,915
She was over to Mr. Lee's
visitin' one day.

1860
01:41:35,959 --> 01:41:38,614
Mr. Billy came home and she--

1861
01:41:38,657 --> 01:41:40,485
she heard him say,

1862
01:41:40,529 --> 01:41:42,835
"Take that dress off."

1863
01:41:42,879 --> 01:41:44,881
And then, she said Edgar,

1864
01:41:44,924 --> 01:41:47,579
he ran across the front yard
in his sister's dress,

1865
01:41:47,623 --> 01:41:49,277
and Mr. Billy,
he ran after him.

1866
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:53,585
He, uh-- he caught him
halfway across the front yard,

1867
01:41:53,629 --> 01:41:58,460
and he, uh-
he had, uh, his buggy--

1868
01:41:58,503 --> 01:41:59,896
Whip.

1869
01:42:03,247 --> 01:42:04,857
He beat him.

1870
01:42:04,901 --> 01:42:06,511
She thought he'd kill him.

1871
01:42:07,469 --> 01:42:09,253
She said Mrs. Lee--

1872
01:42:09,297 --> 01:42:12,213
Mrs. Lee just sat there talkin'
like nothin' had happened.

1873
01:42:12,256 --> 01:42:16,260
You know, I think I am gonna
rent me a house of my own.
