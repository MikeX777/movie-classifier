00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:26,915
Do you have a washroom?

3
00:01:26,917 --> 00:01:28,206
Yes, check over there.

4
00:01:32,917 --> 00:01:35,667
Occupied.

5
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:43,206
How long?

6
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:45,625
Long.

7
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:00,792
Fuck.

8
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,458
Please continue.

9
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,248
Please continue.

10
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:14,708
There's blood in my stool.

11
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:29,375
Unbelievable.

12
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,125
Did you even hear what I just said?

13
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,708
I'm dying.

14
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,831
You'll be fine.

15
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,792
Why do you hate me?

16
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:06,458
So, me and you sitting
inside a restaurant.

17
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,583
Huge four men are trimming tree.

18
00:11:11,167 --> 00:11:12,873
Couple people around us.

19
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:15,542
All of a sudden hundred,

20
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,500
strange cameras,

21
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:24,125
horses, donkeys, straw,

22
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,998
manure around.

23
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,165
What the heck is going on?

24
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,790
Can I top up your coffee?

25
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:32,456
Yeah, sure.

26
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,542
Please.

27
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,081
Thank you.

28
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:40,875
Are you ready to order?

29
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:44,706
Yeah, scrambled eggs.

30
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:45,665
Toast with that?

31
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:46,956
Yeah, brown toast.

32
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,333
And for yourself?

33
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,373
I'm okay, thank you.

34
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,375
Okay, can I have this.

35
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,375
Here you go.

36
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,331
Hi everyone.

37
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,458
It's great to be here.

38
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,456
I'm single right now,

39
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:56,292
but I've actually been
texting with a guy recently

40
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,206
and he texted me the other day

41
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:01,583
that he's getting a new library card.

42
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:05,333
So things are getting
pretty hot and heavy.

43
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,208
Looking forward to that.

44
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:15,333
I have depression and in
addition to meds and working out

45
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:21,081
I also like to do self-help things

46
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:26,083
and I recently started listening
to an audio book version

47
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,623
of Eckhart Tolle's "The Power of Now".

48
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,625
Are there any Tolle heads out there?

49
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:37,750
Okay.

50
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:40,498
And I'm enjoying it,

51
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,125
but I'm having a bit of a hard
time grasping the concepts.

52
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,581
This wasn't helped by the fact that

53
00:13:46,583 --> 00:13:48,375
I was listening to it on shuffle,

54
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:52,458
for three hours.

55
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:59,123
I was going through a bit of
a rough patch the other day,

56
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,248
and I was talking to my mom about it

57
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,081
and she thought maybe it was
due to lack of vitamin D.

58
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:10,456
So she looked at me very
seriously in my eyes and said,

59
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:15,458
"Honey, every day you've
got to get that D."

60
00:14:18,417 --> 00:14:20,873
She was talking about vitamin D,

61
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,500
but I imagined it as in D as in dick.

62
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,125
So I've been trying.

63
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,458
It's been kind of hard.

64
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,831
Hello.

65
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:30,873
No one is available to take your call.

66
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:33,790
Please leave a message after the tone.

67
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:37,833
Hi mom, it's me.

68
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,956
I just got back from LA.

69
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,583
It was so fun.

70
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,708
I had the best time.

71
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:50,623
I don't know, I just feel
so at home when I'm there.

72
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:52,581
I don't know what it is.

73
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:57,123
Something about the air,
the sun and the surf.

74
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:57,958
I don't know.

75
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,873
I hope you're having a good trip.

76
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:06,040
I honestly don't even know
what time it is there,

77
00:16:06,042 --> 00:16:08,248
but I just got home.

78
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:13,290
I had a show it went
really, really awesome.

79
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:15,123
It was so cool.

80
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:20,125
There was a lot of people
there, which was so awesome.

81
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:26,667
I even tried that new bit
that I was telling you about.

82
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:33,208
I'm sorry.

83
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:37,456
I'm sorry, mom.

84
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,706
I'm doing okay, I'm just, it's hard.

85
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,748
I hope...

86
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,831
I'm good, I'm doing good.

87
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:44,875
Everything's okay.

88
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:47,498
Talk to you soon.

89
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,333
Bye.

90
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,706
Tyler come help me.

91
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:18,292
In a bit.

92
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,456
Now.

93
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,292
Nope.

94
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,875
Get away from me.

95
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:35,000
I'll do it all myself like I always do.

96
00:18:39,208 --> 00:18:40,917
I said I would do it,

97
00:18:44,792 --> 00:18:45,625
just later.

98
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:03,958
There.

99
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:14,998
Hi, Pizza Heaven.

100
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,373
How may I take your order?

101
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:18,625
Hi, I'd like to order
a pizza for delivery.

102
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,956
What's
your phone number?

103
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,831
Phone number is

104
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:27,625
204-218-0639

105
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:31,206
Okay,
what's your address?

106
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,415
Address is Jack...

107
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,583
14, Jack Hawthorne Bay.

108
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,081
Could you
spell that for me please?

109
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,831
So that's Jack is spelled Jack

110
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:45,706
and then Hawthorne is H as in hotel,

111
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:50,708
A as in alpha, w as in
whiskey, T as in tango,

112
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:57,208
H as in hotel, O as in
Oscar, R as in Romeo.

113
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,292
What's up man, 1475.

114
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:38,123
Card?

115
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:38,958
Yes sir.

116
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:43,375
Thanks man.

117
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,706
How's your day going?

118
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,998
Pretty good.

119
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,415
Just hanging in there, how about you?

120
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:55,917
Yeah, it's working out.

121
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:57,917
Two seconds.

122
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,375
Okay, all yours.

123
00:21:02,542 --> 00:21:03,498
Have a good one.

124
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,333
Nice day.

125
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,206
Babe.

126
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,623
Hey.

127
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:46,667
Look what I got.

128
00:22:49,708 --> 00:22:50,542
Nice.

129
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,415
Where'd you get it?

130
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,248
The store.

131
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,956
It's 20% off, aye.

132
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:00,792
Sweet.

133
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,248
Where do you think this should go?

134
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,998
No, not there.

135
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,040
No?

136
00:23:22,042 --> 00:23:23,998
No.

137
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,958
Above the bed?

138
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,000
That's better.

139
00:23:47,167 --> 00:23:49,000
This place is moldy.

140
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,790
You get a picture of me?

141
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:55,625
Yeah.

142
00:24:21,792 --> 00:24:22,833
Did he post it?

143
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,708
Yeah, it's good.

144
00:24:35,792 --> 00:24:37,625
I think this place has bed bugs.

145
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:45,667
My ex, Eric, do you remember him?

146
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:48,373
Yeah.

147
00:24:48,375 --> 00:24:49,790
When he was in high school,

148
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:53,373
his best friend got kicked
out of his parents' place,

149
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,373
and he had these two large suitcases

150
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:57,706
and they smelled really bad.

151
00:24:57,708 --> 00:25:01,123
And he brought them to Eric's
place when he moved in.

152
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:05,790
So then Eric and his parents
got bedbugs from this guy

153
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,542
that they were just trying to help.

154
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,417
Good, fuck that Eric guy.

155
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,042
Do you love me?

156
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,833
No.

157
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,542
Do you love me?

158
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,083
No.

159
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:18,750
That's harsh.

160
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,708
Will you come to my funeral when I die?

161
00:26:30,792 --> 00:26:31,625
Yeah.

162
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,042
Would you come if it was far away?

163
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:38,958
Like how far?

164
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:42,583
Far, you have to come by plane.

165
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:46,542
More coffee?

166
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:20,583
Something is very wrong with me.

167
00:28:29,542 --> 00:28:30,375
Shut up.

168
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,290
Shut up, fuck shut up.

169
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:39,790
You shut up.

170
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,458
Gigi, stop crying.

171
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,500
Oh my God, shut up.

172
00:28:49,625 --> 00:28:50,458
Shut up!

173
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,083
Gigi, stop crying.

174
00:28:57,042 --> 00:28:58,375
Gigi, stop crying.

175
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:01,125
Gigi, stop crying.

176
00:29:02,917 --> 00:29:06,042
Gigi, please stop crying.

177
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,915
Shut up!

178
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:18,750
Shut up!

179
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,917
Gigi, stop crying.

180
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,540
Hi, everybody.

181
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:58,206
It's really great to be here.

182
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,123
I'm doing well.

183
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:04,831
I'm almost 30 and I had to set my alarm

184
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:08,790
to wake up at 11:45 today.

185
00:31:08,792 --> 00:31:13,667
So I'm doing really good, things are okay.

186
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:23,248
I work as a server and I
was at work the other day,

187
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,915
and I went up to a table
to take their order

188
00:31:27,917 --> 00:31:32,917
and this man just put his
hand right in my face.

189
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,373
Although I didn't appreciate the gesture,

190
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:41,750
it did let me know that
he wasn't ready to order.

191
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,333
It also let me know that
I could go fuck myself,

192
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,292
which I did

193
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,458
just right afterwards.

194
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,415
Something else that I
did at work the other day

195
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:01,625
when I was serving,

196
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:04,165
I'm always kind of surprised

197
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:06,665
at the stuff that will
come out of my mouth,

198
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:09,750
and I just very confidently
went up to a table,

199
00:32:10,792 --> 00:32:12,706
I put my hands on my hips and I said,

200
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,625
"Are you guys ready to rock?"

201
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:20,292
That was my way of asking
if they were ready to order.

202
00:32:22,042 --> 00:32:22,917
And they were,

203
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,833
and then they ordered.

204
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,831
Yeah, you guys have been a blast.

205
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:31,665
I've had a blast.

206
00:32:31,667 --> 00:32:32,500
Thanks.

207
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:01,956
Hi, everyone.

208
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,581
It is so good to be here tonight.

209
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:09,206
Fuck, it's so great to be
here tonight.

210
00:34:09,208 --> 00:34:12,415
I recently read an article,

211
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:15,498
well I read the title of it,

212
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:20,500
and it said that your
thirties or your new twenties.

213
00:34:23,458 --> 00:34:28,208
So I've decided that I'm gonna
start taking guitar lessons.

214
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:34,750
My parents, they couldn't be more proud

215
00:34:36,958 --> 00:34:39,040
that their almost 30 year old daughter

216
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:42,750
is burning smoke on the water.

217
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,665
So I feel like I'm regressing back

218
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:51,125
to a boy in grade seven.

219
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:56,167
Maybe next I'll light a barn on fire.

220
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,250
Tyler, come here.

221
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,458
Look what I got you.

222
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:32,542
Great.

223
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,833
Can you try it on please?

224
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,373
Cool.

225
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:56,540
How do they fit?

226
00:37:56,542 --> 00:37:57,415
Yeah, they fit.

227
00:37:57,417 --> 00:37:58,250
Let me see.

228
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:06,790
Okay.

229
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:07,831
Great.

230
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,667
The shoes too, please.

231
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,206
Great.

232
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:41,042
Walk around.

233
00:38:51,125 --> 00:38:52,706
How do they fit?

234
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:53,540
Yeah, they're good.

235
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,581
Yeah, they're not too small?

236
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,165
Where's your toe?

237
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,248
- Right there.
- Is that your toe?

238
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,417
Lift up your big toe.

239
00:39:00,542 --> 00:39:01,456
Wiggle all your toes.

240
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,456
Do you have room?

241
00:39:02,458 --> 00:39:03,581
Yeah.

242
00:39:03,583 --> 00:39:05,040
Are your toes cramped?

243
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:05,873
No.

244
00:39:05,875 --> 00:39:06,706
They wide enough?

245
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:07,706
- Yeah.
- They're good.

246
00:39:07,708 --> 00:39:08,542
Yeah.

247
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:18,665
Do you have anything to say?

248
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:19,623
Thanks.

249
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,000
Flowers.

250
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,500
Who got you these?

251
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,583
I did.

252
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:06,458
I got you something too.

253
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:09,292
Sorry about last night.

254
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:14,167
There's no tag on them.

255
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:18,625
They're designer.

256
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:29,708
If you don't want 'em I'll take 'em back.

257
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:37,375

Okay, let's get you up.

273
00:46:37,583 --> 00:46:38,417
Good job.

274
00:46:44,375 --> 00:46:45,250
Let's keep going.

275
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,417
Eat your soup.

276
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,042
Just kidding.

277
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:24,750
One more.

278
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,917
Okay, let's get you sitting up.

279
00:49:45,792 --> 00:49:46,625
Good.

280
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,542
You have a nice place here.

281
00:50:06,917 --> 00:50:08,667
You should paint the ceilings gold.

282
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,958
That's what they do in France, you know.

283
00:50:13,208 --> 00:50:15,581
My family went to France once.

284
00:50:15,583 --> 00:50:16,833
It's beautiful there.

285
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:20,875
They didn't take me.

286
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,250
I can count to 10 in French.

287
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:49,542
You're not gonna eat?

288
00:51:52,708 --> 00:51:54,125
I'm not hungry.

289
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,000
I think I have tapeworm.

290
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:49,875
I'm keeping it.

291
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:56,583
Fuck, I knew it.

292
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:23,917
Hey, can I try?

293
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:27,125
Hey, can I try?

294
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:29,833
Can I try?

295
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:47,958
The fuck dude?

296
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:05,625
Go get it.

297
00:58:08,042 --> 00:58:08,873
The fuck you looking at?

298
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:10,125
Just go already, man.

299
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:22,708
My grandfather had
this business associate

300
00:59:24,458 --> 00:59:27,040
back in the day and he came into the shop.

301
00:59:27,042 --> 00:59:29,081
His name was Saul Cohen.

302
00:59:29,083 --> 00:59:31,792
He was from New York and he said,

303
00:59:33,042 --> 00:59:38,042
"Arnold, I brought you a
salami wrapped in tin foil.

304
00:59:38,292 --> 00:59:39,415
"It's from New York.

305
00:59:39,417 --> 00:59:42,165
"I brought this for you, it's a salami."

306
00:59:42,167 --> 00:59:45,375
And my dad's sitting
there and he's thinking,

307
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,331
who is this guy?

308
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:49,831
You put this in your luggage

309
00:59:49,833 --> 00:59:52,290
and you bring this all
the way from New York?

310
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:54,331
Salami wrapped in tin foil?

311
00:59:54,333 --> 00:59:56,000
We have salami in Winnipeg.

312
00:59:56,917 --> 00:59:59,290
And anyways, my grandfather

313
00:59:59,292 --> 01:00:02,167
he gets Saul to hook up my dad with a job.

314
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:05,831
And so they're in the warehouse,

315
01:00:05,833 --> 01:00:08,415
it's this warehouse filled
with a bunch of junk,

316
01:00:08,417 --> 01:00:11,748
absolute garbage,

317
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,748
but he's a businessman.

318
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,331
He could sell a water to a well,

319
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:16,540
he's that kind of guy.

320
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:21,248
And so he says, okay Yale,
this is how you do business.

321
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:22,831
And he picks up the phone,
they're in the factory,

322
01:00:22,833 --> 01:00:25,998
nobody's there, he says
they got a bunch of garbage.

323
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,873
And he's talking on the phone and he says,

324
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,623
"We got a bunch of shit here.

325
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,042
"You better come on down.

326
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:34,081
"Everything's on sale."

327
01:00:34,083 --> 01:00:35,248
And then he puts down the phone

328
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,290
and nobody's there in the warehouse,

329
01:00:37,292 --> 01:00:41,748
and he says, "No, it's already
sold, it's already sold."

330
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,748
And then he picks up the phone,

331
01:00:42,750 --> 01:00:45,458
you better hurry here 'cause
everything's going quick.

332
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,998
And then he hangs up the
phone and then he says,

333
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,248
"That's how you do business Yale."

334
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:57,248
And yeah, now he's a millionaire.

335
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:10,708
You think that plane's going to Las Vegas?

336
01:01:13,375 --> 01:01:14,375
I like Vegas.

337
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,125
I've never been.

338
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:21,375
They have the Eiffel Tower there,

339
01:01:24,333 --> 01:01:25,542
the Statue of Liberty,

340
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,500
but no World Trade Center.

341
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:37,792
Do you think that's 'cause of 9/11

342
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:50,500
Yeah.

343
01:02:01,917 --> 01:02:02,750
Hey.

344
01:02:06,167 --> 01:02:07,833
Can I talk to you for a minute?

345
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:21,750
I forgive you.

346
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,167
For what?

347
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,833
I found this.

348
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:37,042
What's that?

349
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,042
You think I don't
know what you're doing?

350
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:48,206
You're feeding me poison.

351
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,417
You're making me sick?

352
01:02:51,375 --> 01:02:53,792
So you and your boyfriend
can run off together?

353
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,125
You want me gone?

354
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,042
Bye.

355
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:57,458
Tree.

356
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,167
Tree.

357
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:04,667
Tree.

358
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:13,708
Okay, let's try something else.

359
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:20,583
Apple.

360
01:05:23,708 --> 01:05:24,542
Apple.

361
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:29,083
Apple.

362
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:39,917
Egg.

363
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:43,292
Egg.

364
01:05:45,792 --> 01:05:46,625
Egg.

365
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:50,292
Egg.

366
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:21,958
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

367
01:06:32,958 --> 01:06:33,792

01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:06,373

376
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,998

378
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:16,000
My buddy Mitch.

01:08:17,917 --> 01:08:20,333

were you and Mitch doing?

380
01:08:22,042 --> 01:08:23,208

01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,083

382
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:31,042
Gonna eat fish and get buff.

I recently read an article,

398
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:25,040
well I read the title of it,

399
01:10:25,042 --> 01:10:30,042
and it said that your
thirties or your new twenties.

400
01:10:33,125 --> 01:10:37,625
So I've decided that I'm gonna
start taking guitar lessons.

401
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:44,292
My parents, they couldn't be more proud

402
01:10:46,708 --> 01:10:48,623
that their almost 30 year old daughter

403
01:10:48,625 --> 01:10:52,333
is burning smoke on the water.

404
01:10:55,792 --> 01:11:00,292
So I feel like I'm regressing
back to a boy in grade seven.

405
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:05,583
