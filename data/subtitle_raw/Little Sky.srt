1
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,234
Goodbye, Roberto.

2
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,528
See you, Luisito.

3
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,538
Hit him!

4
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,626
He' ll knock him.

5
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,674
-Good hook.
-A southpaw.

6
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,718
Do you box?

7
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,470
Yes, sort of.

8
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,264
I was a
middleweight Walter Junior.

9
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,936
Another beer
and a glass for the boy.

10
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,355
Thanks.

11
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,523
I also was left-handed.

12
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,442
Let me see.

13
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,111
Come on.

14
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,785
Come on, shoot.

15
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,287
Thanks, pal.

16
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,414
Good, good...

17
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:34,084
I didn't cover you.

18
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,093
-I don't know you.
-l' m from Parana.

19
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,848
What brought you this way?

20
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,228
They told me...

21
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,605
...there is work here.

22
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,275
This place is dead.

23
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,487
I was fired from the factory
a few years ago.

24
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:11,162
I' m going back to work.

25
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,375
See you.

26
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,367
Still here?

27
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,579
I don't know anybody here.

28
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,415
You said you are from Parana.

29
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,501
I live near Parana
in the countryside.

30
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,383
I can offer you something
for a few weeks.

31
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,595
You' ll only get room and board.

32
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,018
-Do you have a family?
-Yes, but they live...

33
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,562
...across the river.

34
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,430
Okay?

35
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,482
Alright?

36
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,737
He' ll sleep in the barn
and he' ll help with the harvest.

37
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,698
-What was your name?
-Felix.

38
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:55,285
Hey, kiddo!

39
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,955
She's my wife.

40
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:50,757
You don't have to train today.
Have a drink.

41
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:54,844
Thanks.

42
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,061
The stew was good today.

43
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,866
Coming, Popeye.

44
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,374
Popeye!

45
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,752
You don't have to.

46
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,630
Mercedes!

47
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,449
Cut it out!

48
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,804
Listen, the highway is closed.

49
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,557
Many trucks stopped.

50
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,018
Next they' ll stop the train.

51
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,039
You have to carry a gun nowadays.

52
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,999
It's the only way.

53
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,427
One of these nights
l' ll take you to town.

54
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,347
Here's the vegetable garden.

55
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,974
You' ll have to pick them.

56
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,310
Little by little.

57
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:15,772
And there's the orchard.

58
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:20,151
The ingredients are important
for sauces and jams.

59
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:21,945
It's not a hard job.

60
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,240
My family always did it,
and lived well.

61
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:27,242
But things have changed.

62
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:30,078
I never liked this.

63
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:34,958
Bring all the fruit here.

64
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,044
She' ll tell you what to do.

65
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:40,964
She's in charge of this.

66
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,757
She likes it,...

67
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,011
...but with the baby
she can't do it alone.

68
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,976
Bye!

69
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,202
These are juicy.

70
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,582
And these are dry.

71
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:26,092
We just picked these...

72
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:27,927
...peaches.

73
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,352
When they are nice and yellow,
they are ready to pick.

74
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,568
This is Roberto's father.

75
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,988
Here we boil.

76
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,700
This is for the sauce.

77
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:33,910
Here we do the grinding.

78
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,662
The seasonings.

79
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:05,859
See?

80
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,028
These recipes,...

81
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,156
...with such neat handwriting,...

82
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,534
...were written
by my father-in-law.

83
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:19,664
These recipes are ancient.

84
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,586
They all wrote here.

85
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,589
His parents brought them
from abroad.

86
00:17:33,178 --> 00:17:35,013
" Preparation...

87
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,974
...for peach jam."

88
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:43,396
" Pick ripe peaches."

89
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:48,443
I learned this from the old man,
Roberto's father.

90
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,030
He learned from his mother.

91
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,949
It's written here: Granny.

92
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,703
You should've seen...

93
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:01,664
...how patient he was
in teaching me.

94
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:05,001
I' m not from here.

95
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,982
Here are the baskets.

96
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:34,322
Mercedes, come to bed!

97
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,575
Come here!

98
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:46,556
Here's what you asked me for.

99
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:48,725
Thanks.

100
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,999
So, is everything OK?
Come here, leave that.

101
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:17,462
Show me that.
Come on.

102
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:31,810
My boy, my Chango!

103
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:35,438
One day l' ll make a champ
out of you!

104
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,657
We' ll go in a minute.

105
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,523
Get out of here!

106
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,532
I told you a thousand times!

107
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:34,909
I don't want the dog
in the house!

108
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,791
Let's go, Felix.

109
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:23,541
Here.

110
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,293
Sleep boy.

111
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:12,590
Sleep boy... Sleep boy...
The sun...

112
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:16,094
Sleep boy.

113
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:20,515
The sun is no longer warming you.

114
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,226
Sleep boy.

115
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:27,397
The moon watches over
your sleep.

116
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:30,567
Sleep boy.

117
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,069
Tomorrow you' ll run...

118
00:27:33,194 --> 00:27:35,822
...in the fields.

119
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,992
Sleep boy.

120
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,425
Look at all these colours!

121
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,511
The red tomato...

122
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,513
This is nice.

123
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:08,058
This is orange.

124
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:11,186
Look at the orange, Chango.

125
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:12,812
Look.

126
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:16,983
Look.

127
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:19,444
How do you see things,
Changuito?

128
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:23,281
Yellow!

129
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:28,203
There's a bug
that can change colours.

130
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,288
My grandma showed it to me.

131
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,624
It turned blue, then red...

132
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,834
...and then yellow.

133
00:30:35,543 --> 00:30:37,337
Weird bug.

134
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:49,516
Goddammit! Don't fuck around
with me, bitch!

135
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,560
Things grow easily here.

136
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:35,478
Over there...

137
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,111
Anyway, we lost the house there.

138
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,530
I came over here...

139
00:31:46,197 --> 00:31:49,200
...and then they all left.

140
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,708
What about your mum and dad?

141
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,253
I don't know. I never met them.

142
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,258
Do you have any brothers?

143
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:06,843
No.

144
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:21,733
A girlfriend...

145
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,278
-Someone?
-No.

146
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:29,240
You' re alone?

147
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:31,493
I had a grandmother.

148
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,454
She died?

149
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:37,665
Yes.

150
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:40,377
It's getting cold.

151
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,785
Fuck this rain!

152
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:20,375
I had to run.

153
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,546
My work will get fucked up.

154
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:27,090
I' ll have to start over.

155
00:33:27,757 --> 00:33:30,176
And then I get paid shit.

156
00:33:32,554 --> 00:33:34,889
What am I going to do?

157
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,648
Good.

158
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,610
Better than the old man's.

159
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,529
No.

160
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,031
Yes, it is.

161
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:53,783
The old man
didn't see much at the end...

162
00:33:53,908 --> 00:33:56,411
...and used too much sugar.

163
00:33:56,619 --> 00:33:59,622
-No.
-Don't be stubborn.

164
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:03,209
I know my father's cooking.
Try it.

165
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,706
Tomorrow you' ll run...

166
00:36:46,873 --> 00:36:47,957
...in the fields.

167
00:36:48,124 --> 00:36:50,168
Sleep boy.

168
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,490
Let's sit down to eat.

169
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,647
Sleep boy.

170
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:56,609
The sun is no longer warming you.

171
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:59,738
Sleep boy.

172
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:03,408
The moon watches over
your sleep.

173
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,973
Come on,...

174
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,517
...show me some punches.

175
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:33,146
Come on, Felix.

176
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,231
Come on!

177
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:37,108
Shit, come on!

178
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,821
Hit!

179
00:38:58,296 --> 00:39:01,424
Look at me dancing like a fool...

180
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:25,407
Goodbye.

181
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:30,078
Felix, I brought you cigarettes.

182
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,330
Thanks.

183
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,171
Tomato! Peach!

184
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:30,347
Jam, lady!

185
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:44,778
Tomato, sir.

186
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:40,101
Here, that's it.

187
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,068
Listen, Chango.

188
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:50,195
This is very important.

189
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:57,577
Remember they day your mother
handed you over to me?

190
00:42:57,702 --> 00:43:00,080
When you grabbed my hand?

191
00:43:01,456 --> 00:43:04,751
I knew very well
what you meant by that.

192
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,045
I know you need me.

193
00:43:09,172 --> 00:43:11,216
But don't worry.

194
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:13,677
I won't leave you alone.

195
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:15,929
You' ll never be alone again.

196
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,348
Got it?

197
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:00,056
-Want some mate?
-No, thanks.

198
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:01,641
Have another one.

199
00:44:06,563 --> 00:44:07,856
Let's go home.

200
00:44:09,983 --> 00:44:12,068
It's still early.

201
00:44:48,146 --> 00:44:50,065
When I say something,
you listen!

202
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:52,442
Am I clear?

203
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:03,787
Where do you think you' re going?

204
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:06,998
You' ll do as I say!

205
00:45:44,494 --> 00:45:47,372
-How are you today?
-Fine.

206
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,416
Have some mate.

207
00:45:53,378 --> 00:45:55,296
Have a biscuit.

208
00:46:11,646 --> 00:46:13,273
It's good.

209
00:46:15,275 --> 00:46:17,235
Bring jam.

210
00:46:25,201 --> 00:46:27,203
Excuse me.

211
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:26,262
Is everything here?

212
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,113
Hand me that.

213
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:49,285
You take the bike.
I' ll go with this.

214
00:50:15,432 --> 00:50:16,558
Excuse me.

215
00:50:19,352 --> 00:50:21,938
-Can I heat up some water?
-Go ahead.

216
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,440
Thanks.

217
00:54:14,921 --> 00:54:16,297
Fucking dog!

218
00:54:16,464 --> 00:54:18,383
I told you, bitch!

219
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,832
You fucking bitch!

220
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:54,711
Who do you think you are?

221
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:50,809
She left.

222
00:55:52,352 --> 00:55:54,437
Mercedes left.

223
00:55:56,189 --> 00:55:58,608
I looked for her everywhere.

224
00:56:02,737 --> 00:56:04,364
I' ll find her.

225
00:56:05,657 --> 00:56:07,492
Leave me alone...

226
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:24,342
Nobody saw her leave town.

227
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:27,220
Not by bus,...

228
00:56:27,554 --> 00:56:29,472
...not by train,...

229
00:56:30,348 --> 00:56:31,641
...not even on foot.

230
00:56:58,501 --> 00:57:01,171
What' s up, Chango?

231
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:07,927
Goddammit!

232
00:58:21,584 --> 00:58:23,086
Are you OK, Roberto?

233
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:33,430
Easy!

234
00:58:34,764 --> 00:58:38,101
Easy, Roberto.

235
00:58:40,186 --> 00:58:42,397
Stop! Stop!

236
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:45,775
It's me, Felix! It's me!

237
00:59:18,391 --> 00:59:24,606
Stop crying, goddammit!

238
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:27,025
Stop crying!

239
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,819
I can't take it anymore!

240
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:32,280
Stop crying,
I just can't take it!

241
00:59:32,447 --> 00:59:34,449
Please, stop crying!

242
00:59:34,574 --> 00:59:36,576
Stop crying!

243
00:59:37,243 --> 00:59:39,245
I can't take it!

244
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:42,123
I couldn't sleep a wink last night.

245
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,668
I couldn't sleep at all.

246
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:48,672
I just can't take it anymore.

247
01:00:04,646 --> 01:00:08,233
Look at all these bubbles.

248
01:00:15,615 --> 01:00:18,326
Look how they float.

249
01:00:26,543 --> 01:00:29,087
-It's hot.
-Yes.

250
01:00:32,257 --> 01:00:34,718
The boy crapped again.

251
01:00:36,052 --> 01:00:38,596
All the time.

252
01:00:56,865 --> 01:00:58,867
Shall I get you cigarettes?

253
01:00:59,034 --> 01:01:00,910
Thanks.

254
01:06:04,464 --> 01:06:06,424
BLESSED ALL THE CHlLDREN

255
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:49,851
Hello. A ham sandwich.

256
01:11:50,018 --> 01:11:52,062
-White bread?
-Yes.

257
01:11:52,187 --> 01:11:54,439
-To eat here or to go?
-l' ll take it.

258
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:57,275
Two pesos.

259
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:03,948
Thanks.

260
01:12:35,855 --> 01:12:37,357
Good morning.

261
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:37,792
A beer.

262
01:13:38,543 --> 01:13:40,128
What's wrong with the baby?

263
01:13:40,253 --> 01:13:42,589
Why is he crying?

264
01:13:49,012 --> 01:13:50,930
What's up, pal?

265
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:56,102
Why are you crying?

266
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:57,604
Hello.

267
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:42,691
He is so cute.

268
01:14:44,526 --> 01:14:46,736
Let's show him to the baby.

269
01:14:46,903 --> 01:14:49,656
Hello.

270
01:14:55,161 --> 01:14:56,621
Do you like it?

271
01:15:02,502 --> 01:15:03,503
Thanks.

272
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:49,174
Freeze, right there.

273
01:15:49,299 --> 01:15:51,926
Give me what you have.

274
01:15:52,052 --> 01:15:54,512
Don't try to be smart.

275
01:15:54,679 --> 01:15:56,639
Hand over all you have!

276
01:15:57,390 --> 01:15:58,850
Is that all?

277
01:15:58,975 --> 01:16:01,019
Nothing else?

278
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,106
Don't be smart. Stay put.

279
01:17:01,329 --> 01:17:04,332
Come on, I don't have all day.

280
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:08,378
Move the bed away from the wall.

281
01:18:12,359 --> 01:18:14,319
Do you want some?

282
01:18:14,736 --> 01:18:16,237
It's free.

283
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:19,532
Finish it or give it to the kid.

284
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,454
OK, let's go.

285
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,999
-Bye, Cadillac!
-See you around.

286
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:32,420
Later.

287
01:18:52,774 --> 01:18:54,526
Sit down.

288
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:23,888
Do you know of any job?

289
01:19:32,188 --> 01:19:33,523
Is it yours?

290
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,358
Yes.

291
01:23:06,861 --> 01:23:08,113
A little change...

292
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:13,660
Some change...

293
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:43,690
Thanks.

294
01:23:53,241 --> 01:23:54,784
Hello.

295
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:00,874
Give me a croissant.

296
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:04,294
How are you?

297
01:24:29,444 --> 01:24:32,489
When you fight
you look as if you were dancing.

298
01:24:32,655 --> 01:24:34,908
-Get the hell out of here!
-Calm down.

299
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:37,577
How do you get
those puppets out?

300
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:40,538
Just put a coin in and see, idiot!

301
01:24:40,705 --> 01:24:43,875
I don't even have
enough for beer.

302
01:24:46,002 --> 01:24:49,422
-Selling something?
-No.

303
01:24:49,547 --> 01:24:51,966
What about that bag?

304
01:24:52,509 --> 01:24:55,345
I' m sleeping in the park.

305
01:24:56,638 --> 01:25:01,518
Sometimes, I do odd jobs.

306
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:04,813
Little jobs.

307
01:25:04,979 --> 01:25:06,356
Small stuff.

308
01:25:06,648 --> 01:25:10,276
It's easy. People get scared
and give you everything.

309
01:25:12,404 --> 01:25:14,280
If you' re interested,...

310
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:16,533
...you can come with me.

311
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,369
I mean, both of you.

312
01:25:23,790 --> 01:25:25,709
What do you say?

313
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:30,213
They call me Cadillac.

314
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:33,925
Cadillac.

315
01:25:35,385 --> 01:25:37,595
" Los Fabulosos Cadillacs".

316
01:25:39,514 --> 01:25:41,391
Don't you know the band?

317
01:25:41,516 --> 01:25:43,018
No.

318
01:25:49,065 --> 01:25:50,692
The cops don't fuck with us.

319
01:26:10,003 --> 01:26:11,588
Let's go.

320
01:26:52,462 --> 01:26:54,297
Come in.

321
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:58,218
Nati, I want you
to meet someone.

322
01:27:00,804 --> 01:27:03,765
Felix, Nati, my sister.

323
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,225
And him...

324
01:27:05,475 --> 01:27:07,727
His son, Chango.

325
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:09,688
He's so cute.

326
01:27:09,854 --> 01:27:11,314
Hello, baby.

327
01:27:29,666 --> 01:27:32,252
I' ll be back in a while.

328
01:27:50,895 --> 01:27:55,567
Look at this pretty doll.

329
01:27:56,234 --> 01:28:02,032
You' re not a girl
but it doesn't matter.

330
01:28:04,325 --> 01:28:06,369
Look.

331
01:28:14,586 --> 01:28:16,504
That's where you get off...

332
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:27,015
I' m making spaghetti,
do you want some?

333
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:29,476
I' m not hungry. Thanks.

334
01:28:29,601 --> 01:28:32,312
There's enough,
only Dany and I eat here.

335
01:28:32,479 --> 01:28:35,398
-Look, I got paid with this.
-Wow! Great!

336
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:37,609
For a job today.

337
01:28:37,859 --> 01:28:40,904
Apparently it's new,
but if it isn't... it's still good!

338
01:28:41,071 --> 01:28:43,365
This is what they paid you with?

339
01:28:43,490 --> 01:28:45,200
It's great!

340
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:27,909
-Do you want something?
-An ice cream.

341
01:29:28,743 --> 01:29:29,536
Let's go.

342
01:29:46,136 --> 01:29:49,639
We' re not going to Japan.
We' re doing a job right here.

343
01:30:22,756 --> 01:30:24,758
It sounds good.

344
01:30:24,966 --> 01:30:26,676
The stereo.

345
01:30:28,511 --> 01:30:31,097
I' ll give you your share later.

346
01:30:34,351 --> 01:30:36,811
They said to take bus 1 48.

347
01:30:45,195 --> 01:30:48,073
I didn't know this place.
It's crowded.

348
01:30:50,116 --> 01:30:51,910
Where are you from?

349
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:53,495
Parana.

350
01:30:55,622 --> 01:30:57,624
Your son was born there?

351
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:01,419
Yes, that's right.

352
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:12,055
Lady?

353
01:31:15,725 --> 01:31:20,980
-Juarez and Lambare is that way?
-No, that way.

354
01:31:21,147 --> 01:31:22,691
Thanks.

355
01:31:22,982 --> 01:31:25,276
We were going the wrong way.

356
01:31:25,402 --> 01:31:27,570
Lady, do you have the time?

357
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,408
-Twenty to ten.
-Thanks.

358
01:31:31,574 --> 01:31:33,118
We' re on time.

359
01:31:49,092 --> 01:31:52,554
You don't always get
a cool stereo like today.

360
01:31:52,679 --> 01:31:57,017
But every now and then
I get a good job.

361
01:31:57,976 --> 01:31:58,977
Here it is.

362
01:31:59,769 --> 01:32:02,272
Green... Renault.

363
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:10,655
Just follow me.

364
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,870
I don't care if it's
used or stolen.

365
01:32:17,454 --> 01:32:18,955
As long as it sounds good.

366
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:23,084
Once, we stole some speakers...

367
01:32:23,251 --> 01:32:25,545
...from a nightclub.

368
01:32:25,837 --> 01:32:27,339
Still got them.

369
01:32:51,863 --> 01:32:53,156
Let's go!

370
01:32:56,493 --> 01:32:57,494
You bastard!

371
01:32:59,954 --> 01:33:01,289
Stop!

372
01:33:01,456 --> 01:33:03,416
Let me go!

373
01:33:05,335 --> 01:33:10,006
-Stop!
-Bastard!

374
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:15,095
-Let me go!
-Come here!

375
01:33:15,637 --> 01:33:16,805
Come here!
