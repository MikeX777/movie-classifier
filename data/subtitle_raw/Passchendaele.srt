1
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,025
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

2
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,361
Oh, Jesus! Jesus!
Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!

3
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,113
Hey! Hey! Hey!

4
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,990
Keep your head down.
Look at me.

5
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:39,284
- You're going to be okay.
- Where's he from?

6
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,164
13th skirt.

7
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,542
I thought the "Black Watch"
were up around Hill 60 or somewhere.

8
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,879
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Must've lost his head.

9
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:53,882
Must've lost his head...

10
00:02:59,638 --> 00:03:02,182
- They in there, Sarge?
- They would seem to be.

11
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,352
Who the hell would put
a gun nest in a church?

12
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,604
Up round "Wipers" they put
one in a bar.

13
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,064
- Think about that.
- Alright, listen up.

14
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,442
Highway, you and Skinner,
you work your way up that side.

15
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,444
Peters, you come with me.

16
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,531
We cover. We lead.
Everybody ready?

17
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:21,994
Okay...

18
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:25,873
Let's go.

19
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,100
Skinner!
Drag him out of there!

20
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,227
Goddamnit!

21
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:49,146
Stay here.
Keep your head down.

22
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:52,357
No, please don't. No...

23
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,158
You're gonna be alright, Highway.

24
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,202
You're gonna be fine, Skinner.
Give me your dressing.

25
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,537
- It's okay.
- Ah, Sarge...

26
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:08,665
Stay down! Get your head down!

27
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:10,709
This is kind of funny, eh?

28
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:13,378
For God's sake, Skinner...

29
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,092
Momma... Momma...

30
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:31,021
You're gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

31
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,958
Leave your rifle.
Get in behind me.

32
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:58,715
- I'm going home.
- What are you doing?

33
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,008
- Halt!
- Get your hands up!

34
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,593
Wait! He isn't doing anything.

35
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,388
He's just clearing his pack.

36
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,348
No, no! Wait!

37
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,434
- Wait! Kamerad! Kamerad!
- I'm going home!

38
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,853
No!

39
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:12,539
Kamerad?

40
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,442
Let's go, double line!

41
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,402
Bombers over here,
gunners on the flanks!

42
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,033
Hey, we got a live one here!

43
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:53,205
- Where's Highway?
- He went that way.

44
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,272
Shh...

45
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,274
It's alright now.

46
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,693
You're alright now, Sergeant.

47
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:25,070
You're back home.

48
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,447
You're safe.

49
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,170
You know, they have these
birds of prey over there.

50
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:44,631
They call them kestrels.

51
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,926
And every time I look at you
it's like I've got one

52
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,137
banging around right in here.

53
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,224
You're a patient, Sergeant.
It's a common feeling.

54
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:56,226
Not to me it isn't.

55
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:59,229
I don't even know your first name.

56
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,607
I'm not allowed to tell you that.

57
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,442
I know.

58
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,944
You should go back to sleep.

59
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,988
I don't sleep.

60
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:10,824
Then how can you
have these nightmares?

61
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,161
I don't know.

62
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:16,330
Good night, Sergeant.

63
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,874
Good night, Kestrel.

64
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:36,076
What?

65
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:39,079
I think I should take this
opportunity to underscore

66
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,832
the elusive relationship
between desire and social order.

67
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:44,710
- You're crazy, aren't you?
- Crazy for you.

68
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,221
David?

69
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,266
- David?
- It's McKinnon.

70
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,226
Yeah, yeah...

71
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,604
Oh no...

72
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,230
No, David.

73
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,359
- It's okay.
- David?

74
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:12,029
- David?
- Just breathe.

75
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:14,406
You in yet?

76
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,617
David?

77
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,502
Are you okay?

78
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,047
Let's go.

79
00:10:57,783 --> 00:10:59,451
Hello there, Mr. Harper.

80
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:15,634
- Hello?
- We're in here.

81
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:23,642
- David?
- Mr. McKinnon.

82
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,103
Didn't show up for work
this morning. Third time this month.

83
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,939
Sarah here tells me
you had an attack...

84
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:31,191
of your asthma things.

85
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,027
That's the truth, sir. I did.

86
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,362
But now you're alright?

87
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:37,614
I went down to the river.
Sometimes the humidity helps.

88
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,241
Humidity.

89
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,910
Good one. That's good.

90
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,416
I don't know how
to put this, but this job,

91
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,085
I know it's just a local
newspaper and I know

92
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,754
it's not going to change
the outcome of the war or anything,

93
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,965
but it's a good job,
and your father...

94
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,969
Well, you both understand

95
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,971
that I'm doing this
for your father, don't you?

96
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,686
Well, I'll just see myself out.

97
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,108
I expect to see you
in the morning.

98
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,908
I can't keep lying for you.

99
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:24,745
- I'm not asking you to.
- Were you with Cassie?

100
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,955
What if I was?

101
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,293
Friends don't get friends
in trouble, David.

102
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,253
What would you know
about friends?

103
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,131
All you've got is me
and you don't even like me.

104
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:38,175
Why do you talk like that?

105
00:12:38,217 --> 00:12:41,678
If there's anyone that
doesn't like you, it's you, not me.

106
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,389
Is that supposed
to pass for insight?

107
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,686
By the way,
her dad hates me too.

108
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,922
- Good evening.
- Good evening, George.

109
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,428
Still no news?

110
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,516
Still "missing in action".
It's not easy, I can tell you that much.

111
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,021
But I'm the Mayor.
I can't be seen to falter.

112
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:35,232
And our son has
a good head on his shoulders

113
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,234
so we remain hopeful.

114
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,164
Are you crazy?

115
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm here to talk to your father.

116
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:57,087
Oh, hello. This is your friend.
David, isn't it?

117
00:13:57,129 --> 00:14:00,048
Yes, sir. I wonder if I could
have a word with you.

118
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,260
- By all means. Come on in.
- No, sir...

119
00:14:03,302 --> 00:14:06,054
- I don't want to intrude.
- Don't be silly. Come along.

120
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,938
Hello, everybody.

121
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,482
I'd like to introduce you
to David, uh...

122
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,109
Good Lord, I've forgotten
your last name.

123
00:14:19,151 --> 00:14:21,361
- It's Mann, sir.
- David Mann.

124
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,946
I'm very honored to meet you.

125
00:14:22,988 --> 00:14:24,990
It appears that young David

126
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,659
has conceived of a passion
for my daughter.

127
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,746
- Daddy, please!
- A passion, is it?

128
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:32,915
Well, then I'd be guessing
you'd still be a student.

129
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,416
And you'd be wide of the mark.

130
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,211
David here counts himself among
the ranks of the working men.

131
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:40,464
- I work for a newspaper.
- But he's not a scribe.

132
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,883
He sets type.
He's a typesetter.

133
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:47,346
But you must be 18 years old and
you're not in uniform. Why is that?

134
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,015
It's a medical thing, sir.
He's doing what he can.

135
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:52,142
Yes, well, he'll have
to do better than that

136
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:54,269
if he wants to earn
the respect of your father.

137
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:58,357
That's what I intend to do, sir,
and I'm open to suggestions.

138
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,193
For God's sake, son.
We're at war.

139
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:03,403
Use your imagination.

140
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,330
I'm sorry.

141
00:15:13,372 --> 00:15:15,999
I don't know, I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to say.

142
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,378
There's no formula here,
Sergeant. We're just talking.

143
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,633
You, uh, want to tell me
about your nightmares?

144
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,055
They consistently feature

145
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,974
the image of a Canadian
soldier and a cross.

146
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:34,351
Why is that, you imagine?

147
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:39,022
I don't sleep, so I don't really
know how to answer that.

148
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:42,526
In 1915, in retreat outside Ypres,

149
00:15:42,568 --> 00:15:45,028
German soldiers nailed
a Canadian N.C.O. to a barn door.

150
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:47,197
You were there,
were you not?

151
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,409
Yes sir, I did take part
in that retreat but...

152
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:54,538
if they had time to stop
and nail a guy to a door

153
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,791
they're even better than
I already know them to be.

154
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,211
- Are you saying it didn't happen?
- I'm saying artillery throws soldiers

155
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:03,380
into positions
you can't even imagine.

156
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:05,591
A man in a trench...

157
00:16:07,092 --> 00:16:09,428
he's gonna see
what he needs to see.

158
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:15,100
Michael, you are
a decorated soldier...

159
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,394
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

160
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:20,814
And I received that medal

161
00:16:20,856 --> 00:16:23,525
for sticking a 17-inch piece
of steel into a boy's forehead.

162
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,986
As soon as you were well
enough to walk, you went AWOL.

163
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,071
I went AWOL because
I received a medal

164
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:30,199
for sticking a piece of steel
into a boy's forehead!

165
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,408
This is insubordinate.

166
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,452
Understand your situation here,
Sergeant.

167
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:36,288
We are trying to determine
your status of discharge.

168
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,832
Your physical wounds have,
for the most part, healed.

169
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,628
Dr. Walker would like to give you
a clean bill of health, in which case

170
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,922
you'd be sent back
to the battlefield,

171
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:48,592
stand trial for desertion and
more than likely be executed.

172
00:16:48,634 --> 00:16:51,929
I'm going to end up back
there one way or another.

173
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,349
Michael,

174
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,309
I'm trying to save your life.

175
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:59,353
I know that.

176
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:02,064
And I appreciate it,
I do, but this...

177
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,364
Go on.

178
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:14,409
The house...
we grew up in...

179
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,121
it was at the bottom of this hill,

180
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,873
and every time
one of my brothers, uh...

181
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,418
- Died?
- Yeah.

182
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:30,008
The telegraph guy, he'd bring
the notification down the hill

183
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:32,261
and my mother never got
any other news.

184
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,641
After all, three of my younger
brothers - one, two, three and me -

185
00:17:37,683 --> 00:17:39,434
AWOL...

186
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,647
And they don't say
"Absent without leave".

187
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:47,985
They say "Missing in action,"
which to her meant I was dead.

188
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,657
So when that telegraph guy
came down the fourth time,

189
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,077
it broke her heart.

190
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,748
She... she died
of a broken heart.

191
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:11,300
Nurse Mann, please escort
the sergeant back to the ward.

192
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:25,647
Major Nigel Bernard,
Canadian Army Medical Corps,

193
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,318
re: patient T-331,
Sergeant Michael Dunne.

194
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,987
Physically the patient nears repair.

195
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,699
Diagnosis remains
however neurasthenia,

196
00:18:35,741 --> 00:18:38,076
Dr. Walker's dissent noted.

197
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:41,872
In light of his service record,
the recommendation

198
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,041
is that the soldier be
reassigned to the home front,

199
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,044
possibly in recruitment,
in support of our ongoing effort.

200
00:18:58,514 --> 00:19:00,516
I came to wish you luck.

201
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:04,061
It's not likely
I'll see you again, is it?

202
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,814
I don't want to leave.

203
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:09,816
No, that's...

204
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:13,195
That's not accurate.
I don't want to leave you.

205
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,822
I'm not what you think I am.

206
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:18,158
You don't know
what I think you are.

207
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,160
You talk in your sleep.

208
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,745
I don't sleep.
How can I talk?

209
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:24,665
You don't even
know my first name.

210
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:28,168
No, I don't. No.

211
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,088
And that's a hell of a thing, that is.

212
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,056
- Good-bye, Nurse Mann.
- Bye.

213
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:47,938
- It's Sarah.
- What?

214
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,940
Her name...

215
00:19:49,982 --> 00:19:51,942
is Sarah.

216
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,070
Thanks.

217
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,705
Rigor, Sergeant.
Rigor is our shibboleth.

218
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:07,541
No slight intended to
my immediate predecessor,

219
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,043
but the sails
on this ship are slack.

220
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,380
The home front is awash
in saboteurs and provocateurs.

221
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:16,717
Odd those words
sound French, what?

222
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,886
Allies and all.

223
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:22,055
Be that as it may, our immediate
concern is recruitment.

224
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,601
Minimum age 18. Infantry,
Service and Medical Corps:

225
00:20:25,642 --> 00:20:28,812
minimum height 5 foot 3 inches,
chest 33 and one half inches.

226
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:31,148
Gunners - Carmichael,
remove this.

227
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,192
Ah, yes sir!

228
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,989
Capital asset, Carmichael.

229
00:20:39,031 --> 00:20:41,658
Gunners: minimum height
5 foot 7 inches,

230
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,828
chest 34 and one half inches
give or take, you understand.

231
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,164
Preference given
to unmarried men.

232
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,583
The blind and the deaf
are to be avoided,

233
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,919
and asthmatics are
strictly "ne touche pas",

234
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,421
given the problems
associated with gas.

235
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:57,925
And on that note,
may I say, in confidence...

236
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,847
I have seen acts
of depravity, Dunne.

237
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:05,265
Kroonstad.

238
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,809
Human depravity.

239
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,647
But gas? Even the Boer
would not sink so low.

240
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,815
We use gas, sir.

241
00:21:13,857 --> 00:21:16,068
Of course we do.

242
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:19,863
Cut from the same cloth,
you and I.

243
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,076
A rarefying experience, combat.

244
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,661
Something Carmichael
will never encounter.

245
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,497
Blind as a bat,
feet like a fried egg.

246
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,499
- Isn't that right, Carmichael?
- More than right, sir.

247
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,752
You saw action
in South Africa, sir?

248
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,968
I've studied your dossier, Sergeant.

249
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:43,428
But you can rest easy.

250
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,347
I have my eye on you.

251
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,509
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

252
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:24,094
a Distinguished Conduct Medal
winner,

253
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:26,930
a proud member of Calgary's
own 10th Battalion,

254
00:22:26,972 --> 00:22:29,933
Second Brigade,
First Canadian Division.

255
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:32,019
Please rise
for Sergeant Michael Dunne!

256
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:41,987
- I thought he'd be bigger.
- In what sense?

257
00:22:42,029 --> 00:22:44,990
- In the sense that he'd be bigger.
- Please, please.

258
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:47,034
You're embarrassing
the good sergeant.

259
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:50,329
Would all of those women who are
present please resume your seats?

260
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,626
Thank you.

261
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:58,629
And all those men
too old to serve,

262
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,089
would you also
resume your seats?

263
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:07,596
And all the boys who are
not yet of age to serve,

264
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:09,431
would you take
your seats as well?

265
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:19,566
And now, I ask you
to look at the men

266
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,401
who stand amongst you...

267
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,242
and explain to Sergeant Dunne

268
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:32,538
why they are not doing
their part for their King,

269
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,833
their country and their God!

270
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:45,133
Kamerad.

271
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:56,061
Eyes wide open.

272
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,568
Next.

273
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,947
- Name?
- David Mann.

274
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,493
What's your marital status, David?

275
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,871
- Single.
- And you're of legal age?

276
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:16,498
- Look, I applied before.
- Yeah, I see that.

277
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,666
And according to this form,

278
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,293
you were rejected
because you have asthma.

279
00:24:19,334 --> 00:24:21,378
Do you now have medical
clearance on that asthma?

280
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,088
I wouldn't be here, would I?

281
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,925
And this isn't Germany.
I don't carry documents with me.

282
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:29,219
You're in uniform,
but you aren't at the front.

283
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,972
- You have anything to document that?
- As a matter of fact I do.

284
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,642
They diagnosed me as neurasthenic,
which means 'shell shock,'

285
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,145
which means
I'm mentally incompetent,

286
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:39,938
and this is the paper
that proves it.

287
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:43,192
Haven't you ever
heard of patriotism?

288
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,744
Do you have a relative who's a nurse?
A sister or something?

289
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,704
And you live out
on Stewart Avenue?

290
00:24:55,746 --> 00:24:56,747
Maybe.

291
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,584
Okay, as long
as I'm sitting at this desk,

292
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:02,503
you will not be going to this war.

293
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,588
Next.

294
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:11,053
Name.

295
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:23,732
How's that feel, war hero?

296
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,993
You only got one arm.

297
00:25:35,035 --> 00:25:38,121
Sad, ain't it?
How 'bout we get drunk?

298
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:43,085
Mikey, Mikey, Mikey!
Forget about the nurse!

299
00:25:43,126 --> 00:25:45,170
There's a gaggle of women,
all free and clear,

300
00:25:45,212 --> 00:25:47,506
ready to hike up their skirts.
You want to know why?

301
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,842
- 'Cause you give them money.
- No, because I let them know

302
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,177
they are in the presence
of a real-life war hero.

303
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,346
- When did you become a hero?
- When I lost my arm.

304
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,181
You lost your arm
in a lumber mill.

305
00:25:56,223 --> 00:25:59,226
The ladies don't know,
which is what I love about this war.

306
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,231
Joe. Got a postcard from Highway.

307
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,233
Seems like the Redskin's
back on his feet,

308
00:26:06,275 --> 00:26:09,570
and by the sounds of it, he's cutting
a swath right through London.

309
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,864
- That's what I hear.
Hey, John.

310
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,407
Michael Dunne.

311
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:15,784
Lord God, it's good to see you
in one piece.

312
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:19,621
- Oh, more or less.
- On the house, my friend. Your call.

313
00:26:19,663 --> 00:26:23,041
I'll have whatever you got
underneath the counter.

314
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:24,793
I'll be back in a second.

315
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,712
- Hey, Royster.
- To Dunne.

316
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,549
Well, well, well...

317
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,885
You two are so...

318
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:34,386
jesusly rhetorical.

319
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,847
This man who just left,

320
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,142
this man would not allow
me to serve - and why?

321
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:44,062
He's been over there. He's run Fritz
through with a bayonet.

322
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:45,939
Johnny, what's this kid
doing in here?

323
00:26:45,981 --> 00:26:48,275
- Time to go, son.
- Do I smell Kraut?

324
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:51,987
- You calling me a Kraut, boy?
- You calling me a boy, Kraut?

325
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,656
I'm just a one-armed man.

326
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,783
What are you trying
to do here, kid?

327
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,494
Mister,

328
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:01,163
I'm just trying
to save my soul...

329
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,464
Hey, leave the boy alone!

330
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:13,383
Let it go, Roy.

331
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:19,139
What, are you nuts?

332
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:21,975
He would have killed you.
You know that?

333
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,068
You come with me.

334
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:55,092
- Thank you for bringing him home.
- You don't have to thank me.

335
00:27:55,133 --> 00:27:57,928
It's, uh, a good excuse
to see you again.

336
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,598
- Well, thank you anyway.
- Okay.

337
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,521
Hey...

338
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:14,611
Do you think maybe I could
accompany you to a dance or...?

339
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:18,740
- I don't dance with soldiers.
- I could lose the uniform.

340
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:21,952
I don't dance
with naked soldiers.

341
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,121
I'm trying to flirt.

342
00:28:24,163 --> 00:28:27,958
- And I'm not making it easy, am I?
- No.

343
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,627
What if I asked
your father for permission?

344
00:28:32,212 --> 00:28:34,173
That would be difficult.

345
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:36,175
He doesn't like suitors?

346
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,927
No. My father's dead, Sergeant.

347
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:40,971
He was killed on Vimy Ridge.

348
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,768
Ah, Jesus.

349
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,812
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,983
I'm really sorry.

351
00:28:55,235 --> 00:28:59,781
Good night.

352
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,610
Ah Christ, that's harsh.

353
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:44,785
Lot of rum over there, I guess.

354
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:46,787
Yeah, but they water it down.

355
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:48,956
Plentiful though, no?

356
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,124
If there's a show on.

357
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,126
- Battle, you mean?
- Mm-hm.

358
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,255
Christ, that word's got a ring.

359
00:29:56,296 --> 00:29:58,632
It's like...

360
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:03,136
It must be like top of the world.

361
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:07,266
And all the shit
these Krauts get up to!

362
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,935
They crucified
one of our guys, for God's sake!

363
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,937
- That never happened.
- Still.

364
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:14,106
No, it's a good story.
It just never happened.

365
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:15,148
Still...

366
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,320
You know...

367
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,948
I follow it.

368
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,117
Lot of people,

369
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:27,953
they take it, leave it.

370
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,955
But me?

371
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:33,292
Every day come five o'clock
I got a paper in my hand,

372
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,460
nose right to the print.

373
00:30:35,502 --> 00:30:38,297
Every step you two take,
you and Highway,

374
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,299
I'm right there with it.

375
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,260
And it ain't just the liquor talking,

376
00:30:43,302 --> 00:30:44,720
but I am.

377
00:30:46,972 --> 00:30:48,432
You're what?

378
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,976
Okay, Mikey. I am.

379
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:52,436
Okay, you're what?

380
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,646
Proud.

381
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:57,232
I'm proud of you.

382
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,320
And I'll tell you something else:

383
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,490
if I didn't have this stump, I'd be
right between you and Highway

384
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:07,367
on the firing step,
right in the middle of it.

385
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,872
That'd be me.

386
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,359
I know you don't dance
with soldiers,

387
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,903
but do you think maybe
you could go ride with one?

388
00:32:39,084 --> 00:32:41,628
Did you carve this?

389
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:45,465
- No.
No, it was whiskey carved that.

390
00:32:45,507 --> 00:32:48,510
I ran a mining camp
up near Rocky Mountain House.

391
00:32:48,552 --> 00:32:52,055
The gold ran dry about the same
time the war started up, so...

392
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,559
I figured I'd go sign up and...

393
00:32:55,601 --> 00:32:57,811
go get killed.

394
00:32:57,853 --> 00:33:00,397
Can I ask you something,
Sergeant?

395
00:33:02,065 --> 00:33:03,734
Do you think
maybe you could call me,

396
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,652
uh, you could call me Michael?

397
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,822
Were you at Vimy Ridge?

398
00:33:10,365 --> 00:33:12,826
I did attend that fight, yeah.

399
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:15,662
What was it like?

400
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:22,085
It was cold.

401
00:33:27,966 --> 00:33:30,928
But we took that ridge
and we held it. Nobody else did that.

402
00:33:30,969 --> 00:33:33,931
The British couldn't do it;
the French couldn't do it.

403
00:33:33,972 --> 00:33:36,099
It was just us,
the Canadian Corps.

404
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,310
You should be proud
of your father.

405
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,190
I am.

406
00:33:43,232 --> 00:33:45,067
And it's not common,
by the way.

407
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,654
What isn't?

408
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,823
This feeling.

409
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:01,291
Would you do something for me?

410
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,503
I think I'd do just
about anything for you.

411
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,592
Tell me about this.
Paint me a picture of it.

412
00:34:10,634 --> 00:34:13,095
I'm not a painter.

413
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:15,806
I'm not all that particular.

414
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:17,307
Okay.

415
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:20,477
Um...

416
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:30,237
In this picture,
there is a river and, uh,

417
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:33,198
there's a horse,
and there's a man sitting that horse,

418
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,076
and together they ford that river.

419
00:34:37,578 --> 00:34:40,205
And all these things
are in the Foothills.

420
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,710
And the man rides to a place

421
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,254
he thought he knew
like the back of his hand.

422
00:34:47,296 --> 00:34:49,047
There's something
about this day that's different.

423
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,091
Why this day?

424
00:34:52,593 --> 00:34:54,928
There's a woman with him.

425
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,682
Is this woman frightened?

426
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:00,976
You'd have to ask her.

427
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:05,606
What about him?

428
00:35:05,647 --> 00:35:07,316
Well...

429
00:35:08,817 --> 00:35:10,819
see, that's the thing.

430
00:35:10,861 --> 00:35:15,908
He doesn't have a word for this,
for what he feels.

431
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,660
All day long he searches for it,

432
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:20,871
and it's not 'til he's sitting
next to the woman

433
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:23,665
and they're looking over a river
he can finally put a name to it.

434
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:25,167
You should stop.

435
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:34,259
In a heartbeat

436
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,345
I could fall so hard...

437
00:35:39,973 --> 00:35:42,309
but I'm - I'm not...

438
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:48,690
I'm broken... somewhere.

439
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,734
Quite broken.

440
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,823
So I'd start to think
you were stupid for loving me.

441
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:59,117
Then I'd begin to resent you
and eventually, I would hate you.

442
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:15,884
I should go.

443
00:36:15,926 --> 00:36:17,928
Really, I'd...

444
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:21,014
I really rather you didn't.

445
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:22,891
I know.

446
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:27,896
I'm, uh...

447
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:32,693
I'm just gonna sit here for a bit.

448
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:36,947
You can keep that horse.

449
00:36:53,672 --> 00:36:56,133
The soldier in
the modern battlefield

450
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:58,093
is beset with many challenges,

451
00:36:58,135 --> 00:37:00,095
most notably artillery.

452
00:37:00,137 --> 00:37:03,307
Tissue damage results
from shell fragments,

453
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:05,601
which are irregular in shape.

454
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:09,605
Wounds are therefore jagged
or, at best, unpredictable.

455
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,982
In the soft parts,

456
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:16,111
wounds show deep
and extensive attritions

457
00:37:16,153 --> 00:37:18,280
and are marked
by extensive effusion

458
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:20,157
of blood and/or serum.

459
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:23,827
Invariably, shell fragments
will introduce

460
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:25,871
foreign matter into the wound...

461
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,499
...making infection inevitable.

462
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,502
Your father wrote this. Jesus.

463
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,295
Pretty scary, eh?

464
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,172
Are you scared?

465
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:38,091
- No. Are you?
- No.

466
00:37:39,593 --> 00:37:42,054
Do you want to introduce
some foreign matter into me?

467
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,099
Why should we wait?

468
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:59,571
Contused wounds
are vast erosions,

469
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:02,157
large lesions

470
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:04,993
forming a cul-de-sac...

471
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:07,788
They are abrasions
with torn surfaces

472
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:10,958
and quivering
and herniated muscles.

473
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:13,502
They are doomed to suppuration

474
00:38:13,544 --> 00:38:16,255
and are threatened
by grave complications

475
00:38:16,296 --> 00:38:18,382
such as gangrene and tetanus.

476
00:38:18,423 --> 00:38:21,802
In summary, artillery shells

477
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:23,679
will splinter,

478
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,056
amputate, decapitate,
bisect...

479
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,810
quarter or otherwise
grossly mutilate

480
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:32,563
the human frame.
In the worst of cases,

481
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:35,315
a direct explosion
will obliterate the man.

482
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:39,444
The soldier will simply disappear.

483
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:41,780
Thank you.

484
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,210
Sergeant, you have anything
to add to this subject?

485
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:57,921
No. No, that's pretty
much what it does.

486
00:38:57,963 --> 00:38:59,798
So you would agree
that artillery represents

487
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,259
the greatest challenge
to an individual on the battlefield?

488
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,776
Sergeant, do you agree?

489
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:22,946
No, sir. I'm sorry, I don't.

490
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,531
Um...

491
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:29,161
The single greatest challenge
to an individual on the battlefield

492
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:32,706
is trying to keep
his matches dry.

493
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:40,255
"Keep your matches dry?"
One of the wittier phrases

494
00:39:40,297 --> 00:39:43,800
Dr. Walker singles out as
having turned his lecture into a farce.

495
00:39:43,842 --> 00:39:45,552
Sir, I didn't mean...

496
00:39:45,594 --> 00:39:47,095
- You have permission to speak?
- No, sir...

497
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:48,931
These are the drawings
of your machine?

498
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:49,973
They are.

499
00:39:50,015 --> 00:39:53,936
- You had a diagnosis, did you not?
- Yes, sir. Neurasthenia.

500
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,438
And I think, we both know
what "that" means.

501
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,941
Your draftsmanship
is impressive.

502
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:02,110
- You're holding them upside down.
- So I am.

503
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:07,115
I'm not saying that
you're a coward, Sergeant.

504
00:40:07,157 --> 00:40:10,702
I'm simply saying that I have been
keeping a very close eye on you,

505
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:12,454
and what I see disturbs me.

506
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:16,458
You'll notice I've left out
certain mechanical secrets

507
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,795
that can only be revealed upon
payment of one million dollars.

508
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,880
A lovely round figure.

509
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:25,425
And what exactly will this invention
of yours accomplish?

510
00:40:25,467 --> 00:40:28,762
It will bring the war
to an end in 48 hours.

511
00:40:28,804 --> 00:40:31,932
Delightful. And how exactly
will it achieve that?

512
00:40:31,974 --> 00:40:33,767
With this machine,

513
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:36,603
an individual
can circle the globe

514
00:40:36,645 --> 00:40:39,523
in exactly 15 minutes.

515
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:41,567
Sparkling.

516
00:40:41,608 --> 00:40:44,278
We'll be in touch.

517
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,197
Thank you. Thank you...

518
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:48,448
No, I thank you!

519
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,659
- Thank you very much.
- No! Thank you!

520
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:54,288
The very ground we are
standing on is shifting.

521
00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:56,498
Civilization hangs in the balance

522
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,375
so I offer a word of warning:

523
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:00,878
Do not plow a foreign field.

524
00:41:00,919 --> 00:41:04,298
Sir, I just don't see what
this has to do with dry matches.

525
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,258
For God's sake, man!

526
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,218
We are talking about
our nation's security,

527
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,180
which means we are talking about
a certain lady named Sarah Mann,

528
00:41:11,221 --> 00:41:13,473
on whose attendance,
I am reliably informed,

529
00:41:13,515 --> 00:41:14,808
you have been dancing.

530
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:17,561
More specifically,
we are talking about her father.

531
00:41:17,603 --> 00:41:20,063
Her father was a soldier
who fought on the same ridge I did.

532
00:41:20,105 --> 00:41:23,025
The only difference I'm aware of
is that he died and I didn't.

533
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:25,277
The only difference
you're aware of?

534
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,904
Carmichael!

535
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:32,034
"Martin Mann was born
in Ingolstadt, Bavaria.

536
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,995
"He returned
to his native land in 1915

537
00:41:35,037 --> 00:41:37,915
and was assigned to the Second
Bavarian Reserve Regiment."

538
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:41,376
He fought for the enemy.

539
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,712
The blood is tainted, Sergeant.

540
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,756
Ottawa mandates
that we must root out

541
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:48,425
the Hun in sheep's clothing,
and root him out we will.

542
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:50,010
Like a pig.

543
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,350
With regret our mandate
is uncompromising.

544
00:41:56,391 --> 00:41:57,935
You regret nothing.

545
00:41:57,976 --> 00:42:00,562
I don't expect a woman
to comprehend this,

546
00:42:00,604 --> 00:42:03,190
but our country
is rife with saboteurs.

547
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:06,401
When did nursing wounded soldiers
become a threat to the homeland?

548
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,570
If I'm so dangerous,
why don't you lock me up?

549
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:10,989
At the moment internment
is not under consideration.

550
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,326
- Listen to him!
Listen to the sound of his voice!

551
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:16,620
How long has he been living
in this country?

552
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:19,373
My duration of residency
is hardly the point.

553
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:22,543
I've lived here my entire life!
I'm a Canadian!

554
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:24,670
Technically, yes.
But here's the sticky wicket.

555
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:27,840
Whereas I was born under
the sun of the British Empire,

556
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,842
you, Miss Mann,

557
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,302
were born under
the cloud of Germany.

558
00:43:33,155 --> 00:43:34,656
We could move.

559
00:43:34,698 --> 00:43:38,160
Start over. Or I could try
to find another job.

560
00:43:38,202 --> 00:43:40,204
Doing what?

561
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:43,290
I don't know.
Cleaning maybe?

562
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:45,292
Cleaning...

563
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:47,461
This is our home.

564
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:50,214
These are our neighbors.

565
00:43:50,255 --> 00:43:53,175
You can't hate
a dead man, David.

566
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,221
And where is that writ,
oh sister of mine?

567
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:59,223
Don't talk like that.
You sound ridiculous.

568
00:43:59,264 --> 00:44:02,309
I don't hate our father.
He shames me.

569
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,269
There's a difference.

570
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,105
If I could kill him, I would.

571
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:10,567
He can only be killed once.

572
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:12,861
Well, I'm not
just going to sit here.

573
00:44:12,903 --> 00:44:15,447
- Where are you going?
- What does it matter?

574
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:57,197
- Sarah?
- I'm in here.

575
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:04,997
Where's your brother?

576
00:45:05,038 --> 00:45:07,958
- I don't know.
He may have gone to Cassie's.

577
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,085
Or maybe our mother's grave.

578
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:12,087
He does that quite often.

579
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:15,048
- I'll take that horse and go find him.
I don't think you should stay here.

580
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,259
I want you to go to my place.

581
00:45:19,303 --> 00:45:22,097
Why are you doing this?

582
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,433
'Cause I fought on the same ridge
your father died on.

583
00:45:24,474 --> 00:45:26,435
It might have been me
that killed him.

584
00:45:26,476 --> 00:45:29,146
I know it probably wasn't,
but it might have been.

585
00:45:32,232 --> 00:45:33,984
Use that door.

586
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:37,112
It's 213 Stephen Avenue.
I'll come find you.

587
00:45:37,237 --> 00:45:38,906
Thank you.

588
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,623
You mind
if I have a word with you?

589
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:55,839
My nose...

590
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,600
Schmidt!

591
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,268
Dead German!

592
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:14,650
Wutz! Dead German!

593
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:23,784
"Mutti...

594
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:26,078
Ich liebe dich."

595
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:28,121
Will you stop that now?

596
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:34,127
Ah, come on, kid.
Don't make me chase you.

597
00:46:36,255 --> 00:46:38,507
Goddamnit!

598
00:46:54,439 --> 00:46:56,567
Yah! Yah!

599
00:46:59,778 --> 00:47:02,698
Shit!

600
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:19,089
Idiot! The helI's wrong with you?!

601
00:47:19,131 --> 00:47:20,299
Why don't you just kill me?

602
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,593
I don't want to kill you,
just want to talk to you.

603
00:47:22,634 --> 00:47:25,429
- You should have signed me up!
- You want to go to war that badly?

604
00:47:28,182 --> 00:47:30,642
- Where do you think
I already am?

605
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:33,604
Jesus! Look around you!

606
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:36,106
Everything you can see,
everything you can imagine,

607
00:47:36,148 --> 00:47:38,192
the entire goddamned
universe is at war!

608
00:47:38,233 --> 00:47:40,110
And if that ever stopped,

609
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:42,362
oh boy, that would be
the end of history!

610
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:45,866
I don't know
what you're talking about.

611
00:47:45,908 --> 00:47:49,453
All I know is that you got
to draw a line somewhere.

612
00:47:49,495 --> 00:47:51,705
And I draw the line at my father.

613
00:47:51,747 --> 00:47:53,457
You think it's that simple?

614
00:47:53,499 --> 00:47:55,125
- You don't?
- No.

615
00:47:57,628 --> 00:47:59,630
No, I don't.

616
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,217
Lines are tricky...

617
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:05,719
There's so goddamned
many of them.

618
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:08,555
There's front line,
sap line, behind the line,

619
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:10,974
lines you don't even know about,
lines you can't see

620
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:12,976
'til you cross them...

621
00:48:13,018 --> 00:48:14,978
but once you do, you're not fit.

622
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,897
You understand?

623
00:48:16,939 --> 00:48:19,399
You're not fit for this world.

624
00:48:19,441 --> 00:48:22,319
You live over there.
You got men underneath you.

625
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,953
What the hell am I doing?

626
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:38,919
Christ didn't die for our sins.
He just laid down the template.

627
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:43,340
I don't understand you.

628
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:46,510
- If I have my way, you never will.
You're looking for romance, kid.

629
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:48,387
You're not going to find it
in a trench.

630
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,682
Get up.
I'm going to go find that horse.

631
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,115
Sergeant.

632
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,075
- Hi.
- Hi.

633
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,744
I found your brother,
and he's gonna stay

634
00:49:12,786 --> 00:49:15,789
with a friend of mine,
I'm just on the corner.

635
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:36,268
Uh, you can have the bed.

636
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,187
It hasn't been slept in.

637
00:49:45,319 --> 00:49:48,655
- This could get a little rocky.
You saw the morphine.

638
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:54,495
When I was 23,
I robbed a bank in Fort Macleod.

639
00:49:54,536 --> 00:49:57,873
- I don't do it every day.
- I don't rob banks every day.

640
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:02,461
After my father left, um,
I had trouble sleeping.

641
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:05,339
And there was this ready supply
at the hospital.

642
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:11,011
- I can't explain it.
- You don't have to.

643
00:52:26,563 --> 00:52:29,566
I've tried everything I can
to do my part but...

644
00:52:29,608 --> 00:52:31,068
But you were frustrated.

645
00:52:31,109 --> 00:52:34,238
No, I understand that.
And I commend you, son.

646
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:36,240
I commend your selflessness.

647
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:39,201
It would seem
my daughter has indeed

648
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:41,411
picked herself a fine young man.

649
00:52:45,374 --> 00:52:47,000
Present this letter
to the recruiting officer

650
00:52:47,042 --> 00:52:48,460
and your way should be clear.

651
00:52:48,502 --> 00:52:51,338
And with that, you have
my blessing on your union.

652
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:53,131
Oh, Daddy!

653
00:52:56,468 --> 00:52:59,388
It tore my father in half, this war.

654
00:52:59,429 --> 00:53:01,640
It just made our lives...

655
00:53:01,682 --> 00:53:04,351
impossible.

656
00:53:04,393 --> 00:53:07,896
So I forced him
to make a decision.

657
00:53:07,938 --> 00:53:10,190
It was them or us.

658
00:53:10,232 --> 00:53:13,110
I really didn't think
he'd leave or...

659
00:53:15,279 --> 00:53:17,781
that I was sending
him to be killed...

660
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:22,494
which seems to be
killing my brother...

661
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:28,750
All this. For what?

662
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:36,925
I killed a kid.

663
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:41,597
I killed a lot of men,
but I killed this one kid.

664
00:53:45,517 --> 00:53:47,269
He had these blue eyes.

665
00:53:50,647 --> 00:53:52,691
They were like water.

666
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:59,114
And I didn't have to kill him.
I wasn't scared or...

667
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:05,996
I just killed him.

668
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:19,676
I'm going to have
to answer for that.

669
00:54:21,178 --> 00:54:23,180
One way or another.

670
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,769
Congratulations, son!

671
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:30,687
You've proven yourself
a true patriot.

672
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:33,982
- Excuse me, sir.
But I can't imagine Sergeant Dunne

673
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:35,651
rejecting a candidate
without cause.

674
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,986
And this form identifies
the cause as asthma.

675
00:54:38,028 --> 00:54:40,239
- Do you have asthma, son?
- Not me, sir.

676
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,199
There you go. Fit as a fiddle.

677
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:43,659
- But sir...
- Shut up, Carmichael!

678
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,702
In your encounters
with Sergeant Dunne

679
00:54:45,744 --> 00:54:48,121
he bore no signs
of ill health, did he?

680
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:51,291
And yet he is not in the field.
Why is that, do you imagine?

681
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,210
He told me
he had neurasthenia.

682
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:59,967
The military is a curious
and beautiful beast.

683
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:02,928
Neurasthenia is our way
of saying that Sergeant Dunne

684
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,972
is a coward.

685
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:09,601
I've always thought that,

686
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:12,688
way down, somewhere,
it was all about sacrifice.

687
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:15,816
Why? I don't know.
And now there's you.

688
00:55:17,484 --> 00:55:19,862
If I asked you,
would you kiss me?

689
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,114
Ask me.

690
00:55:29,538 --> 00:55:31,707
There's only one rule:

691
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:36,086
don't die.

692
00:56:14,124 --> 00:56:16,210
- What are you doing?
- I'm going.

693
00:56:16,251 --> 00:56:17,586
Where?

694
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:21,965
- Where do you think?
- Oh God, David!

695
00:56:22,007 --> 00:56:25,135
Please don't.
No. No.

696
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,387
- I won't have this. You're a boy.
- I'm not a boy!

697
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:29,431
- You have asthma!
- I'm not a cripple!

698
00:56:29,473 --> 00:56:30,807
God, they can't let you...

699
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:32,976
David, talk to Sergeant Dunne.
He'll tell you not to go.

700
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:34,144
Really?

701
00:56:34,186 --> 00:56:36,021
He would explain to them,
they would let you out.

702
00:56:36,063 --> 00:56:37,773
What makes you think
they'd listen to him?

703
00:56:37,815 --> 00:56:41,193
You think he's some kind of hero?
Is he missing an arm?

704
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:43,237
A leg? Is he blind?

705
00:56:43,278 --> 00:56:45,948
Why isn't he still over there?

706
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:48,492
- I don't know.
- He's got neurasthenia!

707
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:51,119
You know what that means
in the army? The man's a coward.

708
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:53,288
- No. No, he's not!
- No, he's not?

709
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:55,791
Who do you think signed me up?

710
00:56:57,709 --> 00:56:59,837
He's the reason
I'm going to war.

711
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:11,765
Oh, my God...

712
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,357
Gentlemen, I'm honored
to have you in my home

713
00:57:20,399 --> 00:57:23,610
to observe this solemn
and hopeful occasion.

714
00:57:23,652 --> 00:57:27,281
- I turn it over to you, Major.
- Gentlemen...

715
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:29,366
The eastbound train carries
our valiant youth

716
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:31,160
on the long road to glory.

717
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,662
May God go with them.
To the boys.

718
00:57:33,704 --> 00:57:35,831
- To the boys!
- To the men.

719
00:57:35,873 --> 00:57:39,251
- To the men!
- Hear hear.

720
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:57,311
This is how you raise an army?

721
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,438
You rake the very bottom
and find the weak,

722
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,398
the young, the sick
and you send them?

723
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,734
My brother is just a boy!

724
00:58:03,775 --> 00:58:06,987
He's not well; he's not fit!
Why do you want him?

725
00:58:09,781 --> 00:58:11,909
Oh, you have nothing to say?

726
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,952
Nothing at all?

727
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:17,748
This isn't out of the blue,
Sergeant.

728
00:58:17,789 --> 00:58:20,125
I'm not out of the blue.

729
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,128
I'm right here, right now
and I'm asking you:

730
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:25,756
who will be there
to watch over my brother?

731
00:58:59,748 --> 00:59:03,168
You know you can take
anyone of them.

732
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,547
Artillery, gas, wire, rain,
rats, the fucking bayonet...

733
00:59:06,588 --> 00:59:10,384
Not one of these can you control.
The matches you can control.

734
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:14,221
You can have some effect upon them.
If you're in the middle of a barrage

735
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:16,306
and you think a smoke
might steady you up

736
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:18,684
and you reach for those
matches and they're wet...

737
00:59:20,185 --> 00:59:22,479
well sir,
your whole world buckles.

738
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,732
It feels like
it's coming apart at the seams.

739
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,319
And that's not farce.

740
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:31,989
That is not farce.

741
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:38,579
I need you to sign this.

742
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:50,549
McRea?

743
00:59:50,591 --> 00:59:52,593
It's my mother's maiden name.

744
00:59:55,137 --> 00:59:58,182
I'm going back and you're gonna
assign me to the Fighting 10th.

745
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:03,729
You're going to try
and protect that boy?

746
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:12,446
You really are neurasthenic,
aren't you?

747
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,909
Cut from the same cloth,
you and I.

748
01:00:19,828 --> 01:00:21,747
You know I'll track you down.

749
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,375
Be my guest.

750
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:35,821
Miss Mann?

751
01:01:35,863 --> 01:01:37,823
Come in.

752
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,327
Oh, hello, Cassie.

753
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:44,997
How could anyone do this?

754
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:47,833
I don't know.

755
01:01:47,875 --> 01:01:50,586
Why are you packing?

756
01:01:53,422 --> 01:01:56,341
I can't find a job,
so I can't afford the upkeep.

757
01:01:56,383 --> 01:01:59,636
- I could talk to my father.
I mean, you're almost family.

758
01:01:59,678 --> 01:02:02,347
How is that, do you imagine?

759
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:07,060
- You haven't heard from David?
- No.

760
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:09,062
I haven't heard from him either,

761
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,690
which is strange
considering we're engaged.

762
01:02:11,732 --> 01:02:14,776
- You're engaged?
- That's the whole reason he joined up.

763
01:02:14,818 --> 01:02:18,197
'Cause my father has his 'ways'
and David had to prove himself.

764
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:21,450
- Is that why Dunne signed him up?
- You mean that Sergeant?

765
01:02:21,492 --> 01:02:23,660
God, no.
He had nothing to do with it.

766
01:02:25,204 --> 01:02:27,164
I - I don't understand.

767
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:29,791
He wasn't going to sign David up
come hell or high water.

768
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:32,669
I had to get my father to write
this medical thing saying...

769
01:02:32,711 --> 01:02:34,505
- So it wasn't Sergeant Dunne?
- No.

770
01:02:34,546 --> 01:02:37,174
It was the other one.
The British one.

771
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:39,092
Oh, my God!

772
01:02:40,594 --> 01:02:43,764
I'm sorry, I... I don't...

773
01:02:43,805 --> 01:02:46,183
What have you done?

774
01:02:46,225 --> 01:02:48,185
What do you mean?

775
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,646
Your father doesn't want
David to come home.

776
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:54,525
He wants him to stay over there
with a white cross to mark his spot

777
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:58,111
- for the rest of time.
- What are you saying?

778
01:03:17,714 --> 01:03:21,677
"Dearest Sarah,
I'm not sure if you'll get this.

779
01:03:21,718 --> 01:03:24,304
I don't know if I'm only good
at painting these pictures,

780
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:27,850
but I am trying.
In this picture there is a river

781
01:03:27,891 --> 01:03:31,562
and there is a horse
and there is a man sitting that horse,

782
01:03:31,603 --> 01:03:34,231
and all these things
are in the Foothills...

783
01:03:35,732 --> 01:03:39,194
And when this man
closes his eyes

784
01:03:39,236 --> 01:03:42,030
he can see a woman kissing him

785
01:03:42,072 --> 01:03:44,241
as like as to smother him.

786
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:47,452
And this man knows
that kings may die

787
01:03:47,494 --> 01:03:51,123
and countries may crumble,
but if people look close enough,

788
01:03:51,165 --> 01:03:53,959
they just might,
as I have, Sarah,

789
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:58,005
they just might find
something to believe in.

790
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:02,551
I have to go now,
but before I do,

791
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:04,928
remember that rule:

792
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:07,055
don't die."

793
01:04:54,812 --> 01:04:56,355
Hia!

794
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:00,442
Go on.

795
01:05:00,484 --> 01:05:02,402
Hia! Hia!

796
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:16,875
- Let him go!
Let him go!

797
01:05:55,497 --> 01:05:56,999
Wait up!

798
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:05,799
Okay, sound off!

799
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:08,260
- What's in the bag, Lieutenant?
- In a minute. Sound off!

800
01:06:12,514 --> 01:06:13,891
Johnson.

801
01:06:13,932 --> 01:06:16,602
- Mann.
- McRea.

802
01:06:16,643 --> 01:06:19,980
Here we go!
A little gift from the C.O.

803
01:06:20,022 --> 01:06:22,441
A "Last Supper" kind of thing.

804
01:06:22,483 --> 01:06:24,359
Let's get yourselves
together, gentlemen!

805
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:26,778
Get that bird plucked.
I need to check in with H.Q.

806
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,114
Ah, what is this?

807
01:06:29,156 --> 01:06:32,493
Nice form. Had practice with that?

808
01:06:32,534 --> 01:06:34,745
Just around the house.

809
01:06:34,786 --> 01:06:37,664
You want me to give you
a hand with that?

810
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:41,627
For the last goddamned time:
I don't need your help.

811
01:06:45,714 --> 01:06:48,175
- Hey, MPs.
The RSM's with them.

812
01:06:48,217 --> 01:06:50,135
Form up!

813
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:57,643
McRea!

814
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:24,837
H.Q.

815
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:33,303
Private McRea, sir.

816
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:38,600
Last time I met you,
your name was Michael Dunne.

817
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,812
April 22nd, Kitchener's Wood.

818
01:07:41,854 --> 01:07:44,815
820 men went in;
174 came out.

819
01:07:44,857 --> 01:07:47,317
Lieutenant Hanson,
Second Field Artillery.

820
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:48,360
Immediate response.

821
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:50,904
We were getting mauled,
Major Bingham.

822
01:07:50,946 --> 01:07:52,781
Dunne here had a bullet
in his thigh.

823
01:07:52,823 --> 01:07:55,117
Crawled across a field of corpses
to get us support.

824
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:56,910
Should have been a V.C.

825
01:07:56,952 --> 01:07:59,329
Unacceptable.
I want a 'yes' within the hour.

826
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:04,710
- Mr. Watchman.
- Sir.

827
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:07,462
You mind having that conversation
with Lt. Maxwell?

828
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:09,965
- Outside, if you could?
- Yes, sir.

829
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:13,594
Major,
you want to step forward?

830
01:08:21,894 --> 01:08:24,188
Turns out you falsified
some records.

831
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:27,191
Somewhat aggressively,
according to Dobson-Hughes here.

832
01:08:27,232 --> 01:08:29,860
And he wants your head,
so... what do I do?

833
01:08:29,902 --> 01:08:32,696
- You have to turn him in, Col...
- I wasn't asking you, Major.

834
01:08:32,738 --> 01:08:34,656
What do I do with you,
Dunne?

835
01:08:34,698 --> 01:08:37,701
I suppose he's right, sir.

836
01:08:37,743 --> 01:08:40,454
Alright, then.
That's what I'll do.

837
01:08:40,496 --> 01:08:43,165
But I'm not going to turn you in
to the military police.

838
01:08:43,207 --> 01:08:45,167
I'm going to turn you
into a platoon leader.

839
01:08:45,209 --> 01:08:46,585
And you will hold your tongue,
Major.

840
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:49,588
Maxwell will come back
to H.Q. with us and Dunne.

841
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:52,758
You're going to take over
'Number 2' platoon.

842
01:08:55,427 --> 01:08:57,721
This party we call Passchendaele

843
01:08:57,763 --> 01:09:00,891
started three months ago,
but it's been raining ever since,

844
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:03,227
so the battlefield's
like a bowl of stew.

845
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:05,938
And the whole thing's stalled,
so the job of breaking out

846
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,315
falls to the only outfit in this entire
circus that seems capable

847
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:10,484
of getting anything done,
and that's us,

848
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,402
the Canadian Corps.

849
01:09:15,239 --> 01:09:18,033
You know they got a name for us?
The enemy?

850
01:09:18,075 --> 01:09:21,495
They call us "storm troopers".
Major Bingham?

851
01:09:22,996 --> 01:09:25,249
The assault has two thrusts.

852
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:27,125
On the right,
brigades from 2nd Division

853
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,752
will clear the village
of Passchendaele.

854
01:09:28,794 --> 01:09:30,796
On the left, the Little Black Devils

855
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:33,131
and the 7th Battalion,
with us in support,

856
01:09:33,173 --> 01:09:35,259
will attack along
the Mosselmarkt-Meetcheele Road.

857
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,470
This is the assault front;
this is our support line;

858
01:09:38,512 --> 01:09:41,723
and this is battalion headquarters.
And we have three objectives:

859
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:45,477
Venture Farm,
Vindictive Crossroads

860
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:48,856
and Hill 52.
That's where we stop and dig in.

861
01:09:48,897 --> 01:09:51,024
These are your battle orders.

862
01:09:52,526 --> 01:09:54,486
You got any questions?

863
01:09:54,528 --> 01:09:57,614
- No, sir.
- Well, I got one.

864
01:09:57,656 --> 01:10:01,243
You were free and clear
of this freak show.

865
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:02,744
Why'd you come back?

866
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:06,874
For love, sir.

867
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:12,337
- That's a sorry bastard reason.
Good luck, Dunne.

868
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:18,218
With respect, sir,

869
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:21,054
I feel compelled to lodge
a formal complaint!

870
01:10:21,096 --> 01:10:23,891
This is no time
for personal vendettas, Major.

871
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:26,268
In case you haven't noticed,
we're neck deep in hell

872
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,604
and Currie's projecting
16,000 casualties.

873
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:31,356
The General's never
wrong so I need soldiers.

874
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:34,067
Now I'm not sure
I count you as one.

875
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:37,446
But I'm going to keep you close.
It might improve your chances.

876
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:41,992
I bow to your superior
judgment, sir.

877
01:10:51,126 --> 01:10:53,712
Not sure
what I should say to the men.

878
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:57,216
- You know, sir, I didn't ask for this.
- I know.

879
01:10:57,257 --> 01:10:59,718
It's funny, though.
You come all this way...

880
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,012
You got a light?

881
01:11:02,054 --> 01:11:04,264
Aah!

882
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:08,519
We need a stretcher bearer here!

883
01:11:30,499 --> 01:11:33,794
- I need a doctor!
- We all need a doctor.

884
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:37,130
Here.
Put him down here, soldier.

885
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:03,407
Oh, my God.

886
01:12:08,287 --> 01:12:10,664
We have to take his jacket off.

887
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:16,753
What are you doing here?

888
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:20,674
- It's what I'm good at.
And where else was I going to go?

889
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:22,968
Anywhere but here, Sarah.
Jesus.

890
01:12:23,010 --> 01:12:25,804
I volunteered out of Regina.
Royster helped me.

891
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:27,347
How'd you get here?

892
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,476
It took me a month
to catch up to you.

893
01:12:30,517 --> 01:12:32,352
It's okay. You'll be fine.

894
01:12:32,394 --> 01:12:34,438
- How's David?
- Okay. He's with me.

895
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:37,649
- We're keeping our heads down.
- Oh God...

896
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:39,860
They're going to make you leave.

897
01:12:39,902 --> 01:12:42,863
My shift is over soon.

898
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:46,825
- Okay. Picadilly and King's Cross.
I'll meet you there.

899
01:12:46,867 --> 01:12:49,495
You can go now, soldier.

900
01:12:49,536 --> 01:12:53,499
Clear the truck!
We've got enough for everyone here!

901
01:13:00,964 --> 01:13:03,133
Make way! Coming through!

902
01:13:04,635 --> 01:13:06,887
- Fall in!
- Yes, sir!

903
01:13:49,847 --> 01:13:51,807
- Are you worried?
- Yeah.

904
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:54,184
- Don't be.
We're just a support company.

905
01:13:54,226 --> 01:13:56,145
We won't even see action.

906
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:59,022
What about David?

907
01:13:59,064 --> 01:14:02,109
If I could get you to him I would;
it's not safe past here.

908
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:04,403
But I promise you this:
I will bring your brother home.

909
01:14:04,444 --> 01:14:06,989
Look what I made you
come back to.

910
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,615
It wasn't you, Sarah.

911
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:10,951
I was going to end up back here
one way or another.

912
01:16:05,357 --> 01:16:08,485
All companies A through F,
battle muster, we're heading in!

913
01:16:08,527 --> 01:16:10,863
Men, fall in!

914
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,073
I have to go.

915
01:16:18,245 --> 01:16:20,455
Can you give this to David?

916
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:26,295
And remember the rule.

917
01:16:26,336 --> 01:16:29,006
You're gonna see me again.

918
01:18:13,485 --> 01:18:16,238
- All right, this is it.
- This is what?

919
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:19,032
- This is our trench.
Where?

920
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:22,744
- Right here.
- Here?

921
01:18:22,786 --> 01:18:24,913
- String out.
Tudor, Crader, let's go!

922
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,806
Oh!

923
01:18:50,689 --> 01:18:54,193
- Shit. You got any matches?
- I gave them all to you.

924
01:18:54,234 --> 01:18:56,737
- What?
- I gave them all to you.

925
01:18:56,778 --> 01:18:58,780
Yeah, but don't you have
like a reserve?

926
01:18:58,822 --> 01:19:01,241
Well, they're reserve matches.

927
01:19:01,283 --> 01:19:03,577
- Those will do.
- Okay.

928
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:06,788
Uh, they're wet too, though.

929
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:12,252
I just don't understand
you can say you don't like Sudbury

930
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:14,421
when you've never
even been there.

931
01:19:14,463 --> 01:19:17,966
I don't have to go there.
I'm a Skin. Skins just know.

932
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:20,886
Fuck you and the stolen horse
you rode in on.

933
01:19:45,828 --> 01:19:48,455
Oh! Goddamnit!

934
01:19:48,497 --> 01:19:51,083
Fuck!

935
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:55,295
- This is insane!
- Yeah.

936
01:19:55,337 --> 01:19:57,297
It's what you signed up for.

937
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,091
No. Sir.

938
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:01,093
Wrong.
I signed up to kill Germans.

939
01:20:01,135 --> 01:20:04,012
- No, you didn't.
You signed up to kill your father.

940
01:20:06,515 --> 01:20:10,644
Hey, I've been carrying this around
since Calgary.

941
01:20:10,686 --> 01:20:13,021
Your sister wanted me
to give it to you.

942
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:23,031
What the hell's wrong with me?

943
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:27,369
I haven't even written her.

944
01:20:30,122 --> 01:20:32,040
And my own sister?

945
01:20:32,082 --> 01:20:34,918
What if something happened to me?
How would I atone for that?

946
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,421
If that's what you're looking for,

947
01:20:37,462 --> 01:20:40,632
you've really come
to the wrong place.

948
01:20:40,674 --> 01:20:42,426
How can you say that?

949
01:20:42,468 --> 01:20:44,344
Come on, David.
Look around you.

950
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:47,306
You see any poets in this shit?
We're all in a slaughter yard

951
01:20:47,347 --> 01:20:49,683
and there isn't a single guy here
who knows why.

952
01:20:49,725 --> 01:20:53,479
No. No. You wouldn't be here
if you believed that.

953
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:57,399
I'm only here
because of your sister.

954
01:20:59,026 --> 01:21:01,361
Listen to me:

955
01:21:01,403 --> 01:21:04,364
forests burn
'cause they have to.

956
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,241
And oceans,
they go up and down

957
01:21:06,283 --> 01:21:09,536
'cause they have to-
I don't think we're that different.

958
01:21:09,578 --> 01:21:10,996
If you want to get through this,

959
01:21:11,038 --> 01:21:12,915
you gotta start seeing it
for what it is:

960
01:21:12,956 --> 01:21:15,918
it's something we do all the time
'cause we're good at it.

961
01:21:15,959 --> 01:21:18,795
And we're good at it
'cause we're used to it.

962
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:22,132
And we're used to it

963
01:21:22,174 --> 01:21:24,426
'cause we do it all the time.

964
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,392
You better hang on to something.

965
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:34,144
The guns are coming.

966
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:45,823
- Everyone synchronized?
Yes, sir.

967
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:47,991
Our assault starts... now.

968
01:21:50,369 --> 01:21:53,038
Fire!

969
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,915
- Fire!
- Fire!

970
01:21:54,957 --> 01:21:56,750
Fire!

971
01:22:05,676 --> 01:22:08,095
- Fire!
- Fire!

972
01:22:08,137 --> 01:22:11,223
Bore 800!

973
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:15,144
- Come on! Come on!
- Bore 800!

974
01:22:15,185 --> 01:22:16,979
Bore 800!

975
01:22:17,604 --> 01:22:19,815
- Fire!
- Fire!

976
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:26,864
Forward posts reporting: 7th
and Devils in No Man's Land, sir.

977
01:22:26,905 --> 01:22:29,199
Fifty yards, light resistance.

978
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:32,244
Get me Division Headquarters.

979
01:22:32,286 --> 01:22:34,872
I want to know if they've heard
anything further...

980
01:22:38,792 --> 01:22:41,712
- Make sure the lines are okay.
- Is everyone all right?

981
01:22:41,753 --> 01:22:44,047
Light?
Somebody bring me a light.

982
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:56,977
Calisse! Fucking mud, eh!

983
01:23:00,439 --> 01:23:03,275
- We got a real problem.
- No matches?

984
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:05,611
Oui.

985
01:23:05,652 --> 01:23:09,114
How does it look, you think?
Are we going in?

986
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:10,908
I don't know.
It's too early to tell.

987
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:12,743
Keep your head down, kid.

988
01:23:15,329 --> 01:23:17,289
Oh, shit. Fuck.

989
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,338
- Field dressing!
- Fire crew!

990
01:23:24,379 --> 01:23:26,340
- Mr. Watchman.
- Where's the fire crew!

991
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:29,343
- Stretcher!
- One second, sir.

992
01:23:29,384 --> 01:23:32,846
- Dobson-Hughes, you're acting 2lC.
Eyes here...

993
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:35,891
Eyes here!

994
01:23:41,063 --> 01:23:44,983
- Come here. It's all right.
It's all right. You're okay.

995
01:23:45,025 --> 01:23:48,862
- Objectives consolidated, both flanks.
Field of fire 200 yards.

996
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:50,906
Venture and Vindictive have fallen.

997
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:52,574
So far so good.

998
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:55,118
So far so good?

999
01:23:57,454 --> 01:23:59,414
So far so good, yeah?

1000
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:02,042
We'll get you out of here soon.

1001
01:24:07,923 --> 01:24:10,717
You're okay. Okay.

1002
01:24:12,219 --> 01:24:14,221
- You're alright?
- Yeah.

1003
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:15,514
Okay.

1004
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:26,567
Flare sighted, S.O.S.

1005
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:29,153
Devil's left flank
under counter-attack, sir.

1006
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:30,988
Get me 8th Battalion.

1007
01:24:32,197 --> 01:24:34,199
Line's down, sir.

1008
01:24:40,998 --> 01:24:43,750
- Something's wrong.
- What?

1009
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:48,714
- Second flare sighted.
Left flank, 8th.

1010
01:24:50,215 --> 01:24:52,718
3rd S.O.S. flare sighted,
left flank.

1011
01:24:52,759 --> 01:24:55,012
The 8th is taking a beating, sir.

1012
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:56,555
- Is your company ready?
- Yes, sir.

1013
01:24:56,597 --> 01:24:59,766
- All right, Major.
In you go. Give 'em hell.

1014
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:04,980
There's a runner
headed this way.

1015
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:08,233
- Shit.
All right, this is it, boys!

1016
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:11,945
We're going in!
Check your gear!

1017
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:16,366
You don't need this,

1018
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:19,286
and you don't need this,
and you don't need this coat.

1019
01:25:21,497 --> 01:25:23,415
Where are you going?

1020
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:27,377
Don't leave me.
Jesus, please, don't leave me.

1021
01:25:29,922 --> 01:25:31,882
It's okay.

1022
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,717
I'm right here.

1023
01:25:35,886 --> 01:25:39,765
The Devils are being hammered, sir.
There's a crack in the line.

1024
01:25:45,854 --> 01:25:47,773
Reload!

1025
01:25:47,815 --> 01:25:49,441
Goddamnit!

1026
01:25:49,483 --> 01:25:51,443
Where's the fucking relief?!

1027
01:25:57,115 --> 01:25:59,243
If you can get past the mud,

1028
01:25:59,284 --> 01:26:00,452
the country's quite beautiful, no?

1029
01:26:00,494 --> 01:26:02,955
Would you kindly shut up?

1030
01:26:02,996 --> 01:26:05,791
Hey, is that a hawk?

1031
01:26:05,833 --> 01:26:08,085
No, it's a kestrel.

1032
01:26:08,126 --> 01:26:10,629
- What the hell's a kestrel?
- It's a hawk.

1033
01:26:14,675 --> 01:26:17,177
We need some relief!

1034
01:26:17,636 --> 01:26:19,763
Aaah!

1035
01:26:25,519 --> 01:26:27,855
- They're coming!
- Here comes the relief!

1036
01:26:27,896 --> 01:26:29,982
It's here!

1037
01:26:30,023 --> 01:26:31,817
Relief's here!

1038
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:35,487
It's coming, boy!

1039
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:38,115
- It's coming!
- Company commander. Where is he?

1040
01:26:38,157 --> 01:26:40,409
- Dead. All dead.
Everyone with a stripe is down.

1041
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,743
Where the hell are you going?

1042
01:26:41,785 --> 01:26:44,913
I've had the shit kicked out of me
for 8 straight hours, sir!

1043
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:46,748
- You won't leave this position!
- Sorry.

1044
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,918
Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on!

1045
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,795
You can't leave us strung out here!

1046
01:26:51,837 --> 01:26:54,173
You're 800.
We're just a company. 60 guys.

1047
01:26:54,214 --> 01:26:56,300
You want me to stay,
you're gonna have to shoot me.

1048
01:26:56,341 --> 01:26:57,468
Beat it!

1049
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:04,850
Where are you going?

1050
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:08,103
- What the hell's going on?
- Don't leave!

1051
01:27:08,145 --> 01:27:10,272
Get back here!

1052
01:27:10,314 --> 01:27:12,232
- H.Q.
Little Black Devils pulling out.

1053
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:15,277
Situation critical.
Stress. Critical.

1054
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:36,715
The Alleymen are regrouping.

1055
01:27:36,757 --> 01:27:39,343
- I see them.
- They're gonna counterattack.

1056
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:41,720
- We don't have enough guys!
Fuck!

1057
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:54,858
We got what we got.

1058
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,736
Two to a crater!
Horne, Miles, to my right!

1059
01:27:57,778 --> 01:28:00,447
- Lewis gunners on the flanks!
- Let's move.

1060
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:02,324
- Go! Go!
- Two down there.

1061
01:28:06,703 --> 01:28:08,914
- Get her down. Get her down.
- Let's go!

1062
01:28:08,956 --> 01:28:10,874
- Nothing from 'A' Company?
- Still down, sir.

1063
01:28:10,916 --> 01:28:13,085
- Third Brigade is stalled.
Fusiliers are being routed.

1064
01:28:13,126 --> 01:28:14,503
Rout them all to hell.

1065
01:28:14,545 --> 01:28:17,381
- Black Devils have pulled out.
Our flank will be open, sir.

1066
01:28:17,422 --> 01:28:20,092
- And our whole fucking line
will collapse. Follow me.

1067
01:28:20,134 --> 01:28:22,094
- I want to talk to the Devils.
- Yes, sir.

1068
01:28:42,281 --> 01:28:44,408
Hey.

1069
01:28:45,993 --> 01:28:48,537
Enemy target marker!

1070
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:49,955
Hold it!

1071
01:28:49,997 --> 01:28:53,625
That's a second marker!

1072
01:28:53,667 --> 01:28:56,336
Hey.

1073
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:03,886
Thanks.

1074
01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:07,097
Bring on the hell.

1075
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:09,308
Here come the guns!

1076
01:29:27,618 --> 01:29:30,496
- What are you doing?
- My gun's stuck! Fuck!

1077
01:29:32,539 --> 01:29:33,999
Horne?

1078
01:29:34,041 --> 01:29:35,584
Christ!

1079
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,850
Steady! Hold it!

1080
01:29:51,892 --> 01:29:53,435
Hold it!

1081
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:03,111
Can't shoot me.

1082
01:30:07,491 --> 01:30:10,160
- Too fucking many of them!
- Hold it!

1083
01:30:10,202 --> 01:30:13,664
- They're awfully close, Sergeant.
- Steady!

1084
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:14,957
Mon tabernac!

1085
01:30:17,167 --> 01:30:20,170
Steady!

1086
01:30:20,212 --> 01:30:22,673
You fuck, fucking, fuckers...

1087
01:30:22,714 --> 01:30:24,299
Come on, come on...

1088
01:30:27,511 --> 01:30:30,180
Come on, come on...

1089
01:30:30,222 --> 01:30:32,391
NOW!

1090
01:31:03,464 --> 01:31:06,008
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1091
01:31:06,049 --> 01:31:09,428
They're fucking on top of us!

1092
01:31:12,055 --> 01:31:15,267
Hey, we're up! We're up!

1093
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:17,478
Allez, allez, allez!

1094
01:31:23,484 --> 01:31:25,777
I sent you a support company:
sixty men.

1095
01:31:25,819 --> 01:31:29,114
You pulled out a whole
fucking battalion? Jesus Christ!

1096
01:31:29,156 --> 01:31:32,618
- Sir. Sixty men?
It's impossible.

1097
01:31:32,659 --> 01:31:35,621
They'll be overrun. Then we'll be
overrun. We have to withdraw!

1098
01:31:35,662 --> 01:31:37,789
We don't withdraw
a fucking inch!

1099
01:31:37,831 --> 01:31:39,625
We don't give ground,
we don't lose an objective

1100
01:31:39,666 --> 01:31:41,168
and we don't give up
a single gun!

1101
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:44,546
But, Colonel, if the enemy
breaks through, we'll be in danger!

1102
01:31:49,802 --> 01:31:52,304
Lieutenant Hanson,
you're acting 2lC.

1103
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:54,473
Let's go.

1104
01:31:57,976 --> 01:32:00,479
Here we go.

1105
01:32:36,723 --> 01:32:38,934
Come on!

1106
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:26,899
Goddamnit!
The whole battalion!

1107
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:29,902
- When do you want this for, sir?
- NOW!

1108
01:33:29,943 --> 01:33:33,572
Every last one of them!
Get them in there now!

1109
01:33:33,614 --> 01:33:35,824
- All eyes here!
They're piling up out there.

1110
01:33:35,866 --> 01:33:39,161
So all personnel not immediately
engaged report outside for triage.

1111
01:33:59,598 --> 01:34:01,266
Shoot!

1112
01:34:02,476 --> 01:34:03,435
Goddamnit!

1113
01:34:08,148 --> 01:34:10,984
Shoot the goddamn rifle!

1114
01:34:21,495 --> 01:34:23,539
Form up!

1115
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,916
Form up! Let's move!

1116
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,044
- Hold the line!
Hold that line!

1117
01:34:34,675 --> 01:34:37,803
- They're turning.
Up and down the line.

1118
01:34:37,845 --> 01:34:39,638
- Yeah, they'll be back.
Load up.

1119
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,141
Reload! Reload!

1120
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:44,434
Reload!

1121
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:02,369
- Sound off! Miles?
- Dead.

1122
01:35:02,411 --> 01:35:04,329
- Cahill?
- Dead.

1123
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:06,456
- Horne?
- Really dead.

1124
01:35:06,498 --> 01:35:08,959
Mann?

1125
01:35:11,545 --> 01:35:14,173
David Mann?

1126
01:35:21,930 --> 01:35:24,475
David Mann?

1127
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:26,768
- Nein, nein.
- Deutsch?

1128
01:35:30,814 --> 01:35:32,441
Artillerie!

1129
01:35:44,495 --> 01:35:46,038
Jeez...

1130
01:35:59,802 --> 01:36:01,720
What are you doing, Mikey?

1131
01:36:07,392 --> 01:36:10,062
- Cover fire!
- Cover fire!

1132
01:40:26,777 --> 01:40:28,487
Come on. Come on.

1133
01:41:19,371 --> 01:41:21,999
Get your asses moving!

1134
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:26,211
- Set him down.
- Set him down.

1135
01:41:27,087 --> 01:41:29,006
You're okay.

1136
01:41:29,047 --> 01:41:32,134
- You made it. You're okay.
- Hey, they're forming up!

1137
01:41:32,176 --> 01:41:33,635
Give me some morphine.

1138
01:41:33,677 --> 01:41:35,471
- Can't get any fucking relief?
- Sarge, here.

1139
01:41:35,512 --> 01:41:38,182
- You need some water.
- Anybody got ammunition?

1140
01:41:38,223 --> 01:41:39,516
- I'm out.
- Spent.

1141
01:41:39,558 --> 01:41:40,851
Ah, here they come again!

1142
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:43,562
- We need some relief!
- Damn it!

1143
01:41:43,604 --> 01:41:45,731
- 8th Battalion! They're here!
- Here comes the relief!

1144
01:41:45,772 --> 01:41:48,775
The whole goddamn
battalion's here!

1145
01:41:48,817 --> 01:41:50,861
- Stretcher-bearers!
Both these men!

1146
01:42:13,550 --> 01:42:15,928
Battalion's in line, sir,
and the line is holding.

1147
01:42:15,969 --> 01:42:17,930
Objectives are secure.

1148
01:42:17,971 --> 01:42:20,516
Aid posts reporting
still more wounded en route,

1149
01:42:20,557 --> 01:42:22,851
so let's make room for 'em.

1150
01:42:22,893 --> 01:42:25,562
We did it, by the way.
We took Passchendaele.

1151
01:42:53,048 --> 01:42:55,384
Nurse, I need an assessment
over there.

1152
01:43:07,104 --> 01:43:08,814
He's okay.

1153
01:43:08,856 --> 01:43:10,816
David's okay.

1154
01:43:15,612 --> 01:43:17,614
Look at you.

1155
01:43:17,656 --> 01:43:19,575
Yeah, look at me,

1156
01:43:19,616 --> 01:43:22,619
all broken up like this.

1157
01:43:25,247 --> 01:43:28,292
I think maybe
you're forgetting the rule.

1158
01:43:28,333 --> 01:43:29,585
Mm-hm.

1159
01:43:30,836 --> 01:43:33,672
No, I'm just trying
to finish that picture.

1160
01:43:33,714 --> 01:43:37,050
But I don't think I'm all that good
at these pictures, so...

1161
01:43:38,552 --> 01:43:41,597
maybe, maybe this man
could just write to her?

1162
01:43:44,349 --> 01:43:46,310
And will he?

1163
01:43:46,351 --> 01:43:48,353
Yes, Sarah. He will.

1164
01:43:50,355 --> 01:43:52,357
He'll sit at this little table...

1165
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:55,861
And what he'll write is...

1166
01:43:57,362 --> 01:43:59,281
"In this picture, there is a river

1167
01:43:59,323 --> 01:44:02,201
and there is a horse

1168
01:44:02,242 --> 01:44:05,412
and there is a man
sitting that horse

1169
01:44:05,454 --> 01:44:08,791
and together
they ford that river."

1170
01:44:16,298 --> 01:44:19,092
And all these things
are in the Foothills.

1171
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:22,679
I think you're forgetting the rule.

1172
01:44:25,265 --> 01:44:27,684
No, I'm gonna cross that river.

1173
01:44:27,726 --> 01:44:29,812
Michael, don't...

1174
01:44:29,853 --> 01:44:32,231
'Cause I have you...

1175
01:44:38,445 --> 01:44:41,240
Mike...

1176
01:47:21,150 --> 01:47:24,236
After the guns are silent

1177
01:47:25,737 --> 01:47:29,241
After your wounds
have healed

1178
01:47:30,742 --> 01:47:34,746
After those crosses

1179
01:47:34,788 --> 01:47:38,250
Have been planted
in all those fields

1180
01:47:40,169 --> 01:47:44,506
After that long boat ride

1181
01:47:44,548 --> 01:47:48,510
All the way across the sea

1182
01:47:49,428 --> 01:47:53,098
And after this train

1183
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:55,601
Carries me

1184
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:02,649
I will love you

1185
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:08,405
After the war

1186
01:48:08,447 --> 01:48:10,365
Love you

1187
01:48:10,407 --> 01:48:12,326
For always

1188
01:48:13,827 --> 01:48:16,497
Forever more

1189
01:48:17,998 --> 01:48:21,502
I will love you

1190
01:48:23,837 --> 01:48:27,382
After the war

1191
01:48:27,424 --> 01:48:29,885
Forever

1192
01:48:29,927 --> 01:48:31,804
For always

1193
01:48:31,845 --> 01:48:34,014
And more

1194
01:48:42,439 --> 01:48:45,901
After your boots dry

1195
01:48:45,943 --> 01:48:47,778
And the tobacco's

1196
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:51,490
All but gone

1197
01:48:51,532 --> 01:48:55,869
Along with all those postcards

1198
01:48:55,911 --> 01:48:57,996
You've carried

1199
01:48:58,038 --> 01:49:00,999
Under your arm

1200
01:49:01,041 --> 01:49:05,379
After I remember

1201
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:09,466
All the words I couldn't say

1202
01:49:10,509 --> 01:49:14,346
And after this long night

1203
01:49:14,388 --> 01:49:16,974
Fades away

1204
01:49:19,601 --> 01:49:23,480
I will love you

1205
01:49:25,816 --> 01:49:28,944
After the war

1206
01:49:28,986 --> 01:49:31,655
I love you

1207
01:49:31,697 --> 01:49:34,658
For always

1208
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:37,244
Forever more

1209
01:49:39,121 --> 01:49:42,833
I will love you

1210
01:49:44,877 --> 01:49:48,380
After the war

1211
01:49:48,422 --> 01:49:50,340
Forever

1212
01:49:50,382 --> 01:49:52,968
For always

1213
01:49:53,010 --> 01:49:56,013
And more

1214
01:50:02,728 --> 01:50:06,523
After this blackbird

1215
01:50:06,565 --> 01:50:08,358
Lifts up

1216
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,903
From off your chest

1217
01:50:12,154 --> 01:50:15,824
And after your soul

1218
01:50:15,866 --> 01:50:20,871
Takes its final rest

1219
01:50:21,497 --> 01:50:25,334
My love, I forgive you

1220
01:50:26,835 --> 01:50:31,089
You never planned to die

1221
01:50:31,131 --> 01:50:35,385
And love,
I'll place two pennies

1222
01:50:35,427 --> 01:50:37,596
Over your eyes

1223
01:50:43,352 --> 01:50:46,814
I will love you

1224
01:50:48,982 --> 01:50:51,777
After the war

1225
01:50:51,819 --> 01:50:54,321
I love you

1226
01:50:54,363 --> 01:50:58,033
For always

1227
01:50:58,075 --> 01:51:00,536
Forever more

1228
01:51:02,204 --> 01:51:05,874
I will love you

1229
01:51:08,043 --> 01:51:11,380
After the war

1230
01:51:11,421 --> 01:51:13,882
Forever

1231
01:51:13,924 --> 01:51:16,635
For always

1232
01:51:16,677 --> 01:51:18,929
And more
