Part 1 and 2 Summary

3
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,358
On the night of
the air raid

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,168
Machiko met Haruki.

5
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:35,835
They promised to meet
each other six months hence

6
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,873
and said good-bye
on Sukiya Bridge.

7
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:42,920
Six months passed.

8
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,154
But Machiko did not come.

9
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:54,754
And a year...
18 months passed

10
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,258
and on a foggy fall night

11
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:02,502
they finally met at
Sukiya Bridge. However...

12
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:08,938
Machiko was engaged to
Katsunori Hamaguchi.

13
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:15,611
Machiko's marriage
was not a happy one.

14
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:35,634
On a rainy night,

15
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:40,767
Machiko left Katsunori
and returned to Sado.

16
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:50,480
But Machiko was pregnant
with Katsunori's child.

17
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:57,655
Senkaku Bay

18
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,789
I was going to
divorce Hamaguchi.

19
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,671
I vowed never to go back
to that house again.

20
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:10,675
That was my intention
when I left.

21
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,373
Machiko.

22
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:19,681
If you want to leave him
that much

23
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:24,645
I'll never let anyone
have you.

24
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,755
I came here to get you.

25
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,030
Haruki.

26
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,037
What am I to do?

27
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,012
I'm with child.

28
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:53,984
And then...

29
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:57,643
Haruki...

30
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:01,414
went to Hokkaido,

31
00:03:01,415 --> 00:03:05,124
and Machiko to Tokyo.

32
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:09,822
But what awaited Machiko

33
00:03:09,823 --> 00:03:12,235
was the animosity of
her mother-in-law.

34
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:15,297
Machiko, I heard
you had a miscarriage.

35
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:21,675
You must feel better...
in more ways than one.

36
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,742
Mother, that's so cruel.

37
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,048
Machiko, more determined
to divorce,

38
00:03:31,049 --> 00:03:33,388
left Katsunori again.

39
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,294
She headed for Hokkaido

40
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:43,294
But...

41
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,997
You want me to leave

42
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,069
because that woman
came from Tokyo.

43
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,575
I won't leave.

44
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,583
If I do, she'll take
Haruki from me.

45
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,916
If I can't have Haruki,
I'll die.

46
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:15,667
Yumi dies

47
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,696
Katsunori sues for
restoration of conjugal rights

48
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:23,003
Hokkaido in the snow.

49
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:29,168
Machiko and Haruki

50
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,083
parted in sadness
once again at Bihoro.

51
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,422
Haruki.

52
00:04:39,746 --> 00:04:41,692
We'll meet again?

53
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:47,757
I have a feeling I'll never
see you again.

54
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:52,060
Machiko.

55
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,297
Let's be strong.

56
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:58,831
Yes.

57
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:13,612
Take care.

58
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,557
You, too.

59
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,541

Tokyo Family Court

67
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:21,517
I have been asking for
a divorce for some time.

68
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:28,883
Since he wouldn't agree,
I went to Hokkaido.

69
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,557
My husband sued me.

70
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:39,462
And that's why I asked
the court for arbitration.

71
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,164
I see.

72
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,730
Judge, what do you think?

73
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,574
The husband wants
reconciliation,

74
00:07:46,575 --> 00:07:48,273
the wife wants a divorce.

75
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,202
These two matters

76
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,705
should be arbitrated
at the same time.

77
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,038
I agree.

78
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,215
I think that's best
for them both.

79
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,717
Mr. Hamaguchi?

80
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:04,127
I think you should just
rule on my claim.

81
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,225
There's no merit in
her divorce application.

82
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,623
She left her husband's house

83
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,125
and went to see another man.

84
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:15,800
An adulterous wife
should have no say.

85
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,739
I never did anything
improper.

86
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,405
- Oh, really?
- No.

87
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:23,736
You traveled to far away
Hokkaido.

88
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:25,546
Where's the proof you
didn't commit adultery?

89
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,018
It's a natural assumption.

90
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:32,048
Calm down.
Don't get so emotional.

91
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,455
He's right.

92
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,014
When you get emotional,

93
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:36,926
nothing can be settled
amicably.

94
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,952
The person that was
mentioned,

95
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:43,264
is he the Mr. Atomiya
that's in your petition?

96
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:44,131
Yes.

97
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:47,867
- And is he still in Hokkaido?
- Yes.

98
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:50,141
He should be in Tokyo
next month.

99
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:58,680
I initiated a defamation suit
in civil court against him.

100
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,879
If I can I'm considering
additional charges of

101
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,355
kidnapping, a criminal act.

102
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:08,787
No! Dear?
What are you doing?

103
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:11,251
I think he's responsible.

104
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:16,690
It seems you're very
adamant about this.

105
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,036
Yes, I am the victim.

106
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:21,964
I see.

107
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:27,232
I have some more questions
for your wife,

108
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,680
so will you wait outside?

109
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,456
In any case, isn't it true

110
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,914
that if you divorce
your husband,

111
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:19,658
you'll want to marry
Mr. Atomiya?

112
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,188
Yes.

113
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:24,869
But that's not
a legitimate reason.

114
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:30,129
You have no intention
of returning to your husband?

115
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,542
No.

116
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:36,108
But it seems your husband
still loves you.

117
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:40,475
But he won't trust me.

118
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,475
Didn't you do things to
lose his trust?

119
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:49,427
No. I tried really hard
to have him trust me.

120
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,690
You have no idea
how hard I tried.

121
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,925
But neither my husband or
mother-in-law was convinced.

122
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:59,625
But speaking generally,

123
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:03,631
there is no such thing
as an ideal family.

124
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:07,273
It may be hard for a while...

125
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,835
So you want me to
endure?

126
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,873
If you can.

127
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:16,886
But if you insist on divorcing,

128
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:23,685
we'll speak to your husband.
but it'll be difficult.

129
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:28,056
I agree. You must be prepared.
It will be difficult.

130
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,085
It's going to take
a long time...

131
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,280
Yes.

132
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:53,146
I don't care how long it takes.

133
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:56,920
But for him to sue Haruki...

134
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:02,764
He'll be worried
and humiliated.

135
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:09,104
Aunt? Why did I go
to Hokkaido?

136
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,231
I wish I hadn't gone.

137
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,803
What's done is done.

138
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,576
You can cry, Machiko.

139
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,146
If you're sad,
cry all you want.

140
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,658
You're just like
the tree over there.

141
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,050
But when spring comes,

142
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,964
that tree will grow
new leaves,

143
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,800
flowers will bloom.

144
00:12:38,858 --> 00:12:41,338
Understand?
So be strong.

145
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,712
Some people like
having Sado

146
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,715
in the middle of Tokyo
and that's why they come.

147
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,229
But it was my dream
to have my own restaurant.

148
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,889
It's small but it's mine,

149
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:16,932
so you can stay as long
as you need to win the trial.

150
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,676
Thank you so much.

151
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,445
Ma'am? A customer
wants to talk to you.

152
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:29,350
Isn't that funny? Ma'am
without a husband?

153
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,179
You both must be tired.

154
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,955
Don't wait for me.
Go to bed.

155
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:39,661
Just the thought of a trial
gives me a headache.

156
00:14:02,241 --> 00:14:05,911
According to the plaintiff,
Katsunori Hamaguchi,

157
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,583
the defendant,
Haruki Atomiya,

158
00:14:07,584 --> 00:14:10,288
compelled the plaintiff's
wife, Machiko Hamaguchi,

159
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,117
to go to Hokkaido,

160
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:13,791
had an adulterous
relationship,

161
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:16,321
and defamed the plaintiff.

162
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,461
How do you plead,
Defendant?

163
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:27,135
I declare that what is
in the complaint is groundless.

164
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,137
I will now ask the plaintiff.

165
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,606
While your wife was still
living with you

166
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:38,054
how far did the relationship
with the defendant go?

167
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,087
I don't know the details.

168
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:45,250
But even after
we were married,

169
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,891
the defendant was secretly
sending letters.

170
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:50,789
That's a lie.
There's no truth to...

171
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,758
Defendant, keep quiet.

172
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,466
The plaintiff is making
his statement.

173
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,432
When I became
his superior

174
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,601
in the PR department,

175
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,642
the defendant and Machiko
met at the kabuki theater.

176
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:10,175
Mr. Hamaguchi,
you got it all wrong.

177
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,621
You keep quiet.

178
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:15,247
The conversation
between them,

179
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,783
according to Machiko,

180
00:15:17,784 --> 00:15:20,352
was that they would
never meet again.

181
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:25,826
That means they were
indeed meeting.

182
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,961
Further proof is that
the defendant

183
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,264
summoned Machiko
to his lodgings

184
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,575
and met with her alone
in his room.

185
00:15:35,802 --> 00:15:37,509
Mr. Hamaguchi,

186
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:42,251
that's because you
forced me to resign.

187
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:47,012
The defendant should
keep quiet.

188
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:49,152
But I have to say this.

189
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:53,898
Machiko came to apologize to me

190
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,991
because I lost my job
because of her.

191
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,861
The plaintiff is making
a statement.

192
00:15:58,862 --> 00:16:00,427
- Keep quiet
- No, I won't.

193
00:16:00,428 --> 00:16:01,428
I can't remain silent.

194
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:05,099
Do you know why you're
being sued?

195
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,941
Have you no shame?

196
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,238
You're the one who
should be ashamed.

197
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:13,682
What?

198
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:18,412
I could prove my innocence
if this was about me.

199
00:16:18,413 --> 00:16:20,579
But when it concerns Machiko...

200
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:24,824
How dare you refer to
his wife in such a manner!

201
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,589
Shameless!

202
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:33,936
Judge. As you can see,
he is unrepentant.

203
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:38,603
He is brazen.
He is vile.

204
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,931
Stop this!

205
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,741
Please don't torture
Mr. Atomiya.

206
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,247
Please stop...
Please...

207
00:16:44,737 --> 00:16:45,738
Stop.

208
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:50,046
Stop!
Please stop.

209
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,392
Machiko.

210
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,758
Machiko.

211
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,997
What's the matter?

212
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,003
A bad dream?

213
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,805
Aunt.

214
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,232
- May I help you?
- I'm Hamaguchi.

215
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:44,936
I'm here to see
Mr. Nagahashi.

216
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:46,774
This way.

217
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,480
It's been a while.

218
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,813
Thank you for trying to
help before.

219
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,385
I'm sorry I couldn't be
of any help.

220
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:08,397
I've been transferred
to the Kumamoto office.

221
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,526
So I haven't done anything,

222
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:12,662
but I hear things have
escalated.

223
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,496
Please sit down.

224
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:24,538
I saw Hamaguchi
at the office yesterday.

225
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:32,284
I suppose his jealousy
is driving him to revenge.

226
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:39,354
But this eye for an eye attitude
will only hurt the both of you.

227
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:43,226
It won't do Hamaguchi
any good either.

228
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:48,697
So, I took it upon myself
to mediate

229
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:50,672
and spoke to Hamaguchi.

230
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,570
Will you put yourself
in my hands?

231
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,313
I want you to come
to Kyushu with me.

232
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,606
You can stay at my house.

233
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,553
Or you can work.

234
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:07,324
Will you put yourself
under my supervision

235
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:11,761
and not see Mr. Atomiya
for a while?

236
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:15,557
Hamaguchi says he will
withdraw his suit then.

237
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:18,794
And he'll more rationally
consider the future.

238
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,965
Perhaps this is not
a satisfactory arrangement.

239
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:27,472
But Hamaguchi is
being obstinate.

240
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:32,382
I urge you to do so
and wait for the right time.

241
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:36,351
Perhaps Hamaguchi
will change.

242
00:19:37,243 --> 00:19:39,951
Fighting it out in court

243
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,958
not lead to a solution
very easily.

244
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,184
Well, Machiko?
How about it?

245
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,723
Or do you want to keep
fighting in court?

246
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,963
I hear you're with your aunt.

247
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,040
Why don't you discuss it
with her?

248
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,123
Mr. Atomiya.
Machiko went to Kyushu,

249
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,923
without waiting for you
to come back.

250
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:26,725
She promised not to
see you for some time

251
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,967
in exchange for Hamaguchi
withdrawing the suit.

252
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:32,776
Machiko couldn't bear
the thought of

253
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,044
yon being dragged into court
because of her.

254
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,277
In any case, come back
to Tokyo soon.

255
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,549
Everyone's waiting.

256
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:50,724
I asked you to come here
to console you.

257
00:20:51,684 --> 00:20:57,134
But Hokkaido just caused you
more heartache.

258
00:20:57,957 --> 00:20:59,630
I'm really sorry.

259
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:05,699
No, it was me that caused
you all the trouble.

260
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:09,269
No problem.
Be well.

261
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:16,316
And come back to Hokkaido
with Machiko someday.

262
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,523
I'll be praying for that day.

263
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:04,760
Hokkaido just caused you
more heartache.

264
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:01,820
Kyushu

265
00:23:04,917 --> 00:23:09,388
Unzen

266
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,477
Mr. Nagahashi is waiting
in the lobby.

267
00:23:55,478 --> 00:23:58,141
Thank you.

268
00:24:13,886 --> 00:24:14,990
Hello.

269
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:18,398
Mr. Nagahashi wants
to talk to you.

270
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:20,002
Please make yourself
at home.

271
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:25,630
- How's it going?
- I'm fine, thank you.

272
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,874
We need to talk.
Shall we take a walk?

273
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,514
I'll speak to the manager.

274
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:50,163
I received a letter from
Hamaguchi yesterday.

275
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,731
He said he will
give you a divorce.

276
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:59,400
However,
there's a huge condition.

277
00:25:00,633 --> 00:25:05,903
He'll agree to it
only if you marry

278
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:08,043
any other man but
Haruki Atomiya.

279
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,226
Surprised?

280
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:28,799
It looks like Hamaguchi
is not rational concerning you.

281
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,799
He wasn't like that before.

282
00:25:33,332 --> 00:25:38,611
He was earnest...
perhaps too earnest.

283
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:43,841
So when he went off
the deep end,

284
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,254
he couldn't
come up again.

285
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,929
This is a conundrum.

286
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,623
What will you do?

287
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,298
There's nothing I can do.

288
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,662
Mrs. Hamaguchi.

289
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,299
You're the guest
in room 201.

290
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,824
Don't refer to me like that.

291
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,728
- My name is Soejima.
- I'm sorry.

292
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,867
I'm kidding.

293
00:26:38,297 --> 00:26:41,365
Isn't that man
you were talking to

294
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:43,004
the lieutenant governor
Mr. Nagahashi?

295
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,906
You know him?

296
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:50,878
I've met him on business
a couple of times.

297
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,255
What were you two
talking about?

298
00:26:55,681 --> 00:26:58,628
It looked serious.
Am I right?

299
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:06,799
I sense you are
very unhappy.

300
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:11,402
Oh, sorry.

301
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,811
I've been thinking that
for some time.

302
00:27:16,902 --> 00:27:19,382
And I've felt for you.

303
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,920
I'll go say hello
to Mr. Nagahashi.

304
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:32,350
Oh, Mrs. Hamaguchi?

305
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:36,322
I'd like to get to know you.

306
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,717
- Hiya!
- Are you leaving, Editor?

307
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,324
- What brings you here?
- I was passing by.

308
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:10,988
Is Mr. Atomiya here?

309
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,691
He has a guest.
How's business?

310
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,259
Good, thanks.

311
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,061
Please keep us in mind.

312
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,997
Thanks.
Atomiya will be jealous.

313
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:23,801
Don't joke.
Mr. Atomiya and I...

314
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,641
- You're not involved?
- No.

315
00:28:25,642 --> 00:28:27,344
Then I'll be by
to seduce you.

316
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,446
- You don't mind?
- Not at all. I'll be waiting.

317
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:33,150
And when I do, you'll
give me the cold shoulder.

318
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,649
Oops, I almost forgot.
A present for my wife.

319
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,425
- May I sit down?
- Please.

320
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,573
Katsunori Hamaguchi

321
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,778
It may be
unacceptable to you,

322
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,638
but it's the best I can do.

323
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,951
So think about it
and give me an answer.

324
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,484
Good-bye.

325
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:29,534
Thanks for waiting.

326
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,680
I thought divorce
was simple these days.

327
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,493
But there are extenuating
circumstances.

328
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:46,687
I see.

329
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:52,035
I hear your former wife
was beautiful.

330
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,830
I'm apprehensive.

331
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,210
What's happened?

332
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,747
A mixed-race child was
run over.

333
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,550
What a bother.

334
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,792
I see. He said the same
thing to Machiko.

335
00:30:27,225 --> 00:30:28,727
He's no gentleman.

336
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:33,569
Maybe you should just
marry me.

337
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,837
But that's not on.

338
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,379
Want to talk at my place?

339
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:46,483
Yes?
I'm Atomiya.

340
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:51,325
Oh, Asa.
What? Toshiki?

341
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,456
What?

342
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:57,329
The driver just left.

343
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,134
He didn't care because
the boy is mixed-race.

344
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,600
He said he'll send
money later,

345
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:04,130
like Toshiki wasn't human.

346
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:05,698
I see.

347
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,702
I feel so sorry for Kozue.

348
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,776
Mr. Kaseda.

349
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,173
How is he?

350
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,586
They just finished
operating.

351
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,470
Kozue.

352
00:31:35,627 --> 00:31:37,004
This is awful.

353
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,302
Be strong.

354
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,445
Doctor?
Will he live?

355
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,112
If he gets through tonight.

356
00:31:52,778 --> 00:31:54,945
We'll do all we can.

357
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,289
Thank you.

358
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,825
Doctor? Please.

359
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,238
I don't care if
he becomes disabled.

360
00:32:10,239 --> 00:32:15,177
Please safe his life.
Doctor, please.

361
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,672
Please be quiet.

362
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,375
Why are we so
unfortunate?

363
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,110
We're all good people.

364
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:32,714
Mr. Atomiya?

365
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,547
You can see Sukiya Bridge
from here.

366
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,559
I wonder how
Machiko's doing.

367
00:33:56,134 --> 00:34:04,280
Aya. I may be going
to Europe soon.

368
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,421
What?

369
00:34:07,813 --> 00:34:12,159
The magazine wants
to send me as a reporter.

370
00:34:13,485 --> 00:34:15,590
You're going to leave
Machiko like this?

371
00:34:30,835 --> 00:34:37,116
When the wind blows...

372
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:44,458
When the wind blows

373
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:52,489
memories may change...

374
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:59,931
Colored by the neon...

375
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:07,338
Some may cry

376
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:12,339
but Sukiya Bridge

377
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:23,116
never changes.

378
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:42,943
Isn't this awesome?

379
00:35:43,875 --> 00:35:45,877
This is Mt Unzen's
silver frost.

380
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:49,213
The fog on the
bare trees

381
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:51,194
freezes during the night.

382
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,529
Look, an ice forest,

383
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,364
and ice woods.

384
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,471
Ice branches...

385
00:36:11,069 --> 00:36:12,912
It's like a dream.

386
00:36:14,439 --> 00:36:17,010
Why is nature
so beautiful?

387
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:29,758
But, Mrs. Hamaguchi,

388
00:36:30,422 --> 00:36:32,559
the reason humans
see nature as beautiful

389
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,900
is because they are
unhappy.

390
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,634
Aren't you in the
throes of unhappiness?

391
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,737
Mrs. Hamaguchi,

392
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:48,772
the reason I came
to Unzen

393
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,117
is to ask you to marry me.

394
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,720
Mr. Nagahashi has
told me all about you.

395
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:01,991
That you're having
a difficult time,

396
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:04,690
with your divorce

397
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:08,500
and about this man
Atomiya.

398
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,570
Machiko.

399
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:20,838
Your husband Hamaguchi

400
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,981
says that if you marry
anyone but Atomiya

401
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:29,788
he will agree
to divorce you.

402
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,687
That set me thinking.

403
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:37,461
I have to make you happy.
That's what I thought.

404
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:42,199
That's because from
the first time I saw you,

405
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:46,040
I knew you were the woman
I was looking for.

406
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:49,076
Machiko.

407
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:53,080
Will you marry me?

408
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:00,551
Of course, it can be
on paper in the beginning,

409
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,359
to make Hamaguchi
agree to a divorce.

410
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:07,921
You can do whatever
you like after that.

411
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:12,429
You can go marry Atomiya

412
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,771
or enter into
a real marriage with me.

413
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:26,007
Well? Does that
interest you?

414
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:36,358
The ice branches...

415
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:57,212
Then that's your
final answer?

416
00:38:58,136 --> 00:38:59,308
Yes.

417
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:04,318
I see.
That's a problem.

418
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:08,916
What am I supposed to do?

419
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,318
I often think about this.

420
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:17,287
It all began because
I was sympathetic

421
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:18,790
to you and Machiko's plight.

422
00:39:19,958 --> 00:39:21,995
I took Machiko to
look for you

423
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:25,566
from Sado to Tokyo
and even to Toba.

424
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,405
But we couldn't find you.

425
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,307
And because of that,
Machiko married me.

426
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,254
But I didn't force her.

427
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,918
It was Machiko
who suggested it,

428
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,656
on the beach at Wagu.

429
00:39:52,924 --> 00:39:58,033
I was elated, so happy.
I couldn't believe it.

430
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,307
But you have to believe
your good fortune.

431
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,917
I told myself many times
that Machiko was mine.

432
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:16,089
And after a year, I was
confident of my happiness.

433
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,822
Then...

434
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:21,320
YOU appeared.

435
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:27,792
That was when
I was transferred to Tokyo.

436
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:31,601
What should I have done?

437
00:40:33,565 --> 00:40:36,978
You and Machiko may think
I'm a despicable man.

438
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,913
But you two don't know
how I've suffered.

439
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,616
You don't know how I suffer
from my love for Machiko.

440
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,581
I was so miserable
caught between

441
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:53,085
you and Machiko
and Machiko and Mother.

442
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:01,633
Mr. Atomiya.

443
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,394
If you and Machiko
get together,

444
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:07,899
it would be a slap in my
face and my suffering.

445
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,802
Don't you think so?

446
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,975
Sometimes humiliation

447
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,649
is worse than death
for a man.

448
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:25,959
Mr. Hamaguchi.

449
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:32,356
It's not that I don't
understand how you feel.

450
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,502
It was fate.

451
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:42,532
But wasn't it you,
your doing

452
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,980
that drove us to where
we are today?

453
00:41:47,438 --> 00:41:54,048
I tried to forget Machiko
numerous times.

454
00:41:54,846 --> 00:42:00,694
I have never forgotten that
Machiko was your wife.

455
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,100
I've always honored
that relationship.

456
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,464
You have to believe that.

457
00:42:11,796 --> 00:42:15,437
But it's different now.

458
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:21,543
I believe that
marrying Machiko

459
00:42:21,906 --> 00:42:26,582
is an obligation
to myself and Machiko.

460
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,265
I don't care what you think.

461
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:48,301
But Machiko is still my wife.

462
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:53,408
Legally and also
emotionally for me.

463
00:42:58,276 --> 00:42:59,846
Atomiya.

464
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:06,359
If I never divorce Machiko,
what will you do?

465
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,739
It can't be helped.

466
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:22,103
I'll wait forever
until you relent.

467
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:37,220
Read this.

468
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,488
It's from a man named
Soejima from Kyushu.

469
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:45,124
He says he wants
to marry Machiko.

470
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,412
What do you think
of the letter?

471
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:02,881
I'm not saying
I believe the letter.

472
00:44:05,576 --> 00:44:07,749
Do you know this man
Soejima?

473
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,014
No.

474
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:12,551
Are you telling the truth?

475
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:15,222
Why would I lie?

476
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:18,422
I see.

477
00:44:19,424 --> 00:44:25,500
I thought you and Machiko
were in on that letter.

478
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,702
But now that I've
spoken to you,

479
00:44:31,703 --> 00:44:33,307
I know that's not true.

480
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,587
Atomiya.

481
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,929
We both love Machiko
too much.

482
00:45:14,178 --> 00:45:16,988
Katsunori.
Yoshiko is here.

483
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:22,089
Come in.

484
00:45:23,688 --> 00:45:25,388
You have a guest.

485
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,096
No, it's all right.

486
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,502
I have to go back
to the office.

487
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:36,635
There's not much time
until I depart.

488
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:40,614
So I'll say good-bye.
Sorry to have bothered you.

489
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,666
- It's a great house.
- Not at all.

490
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,769
It must seem like a closet
compared to yours.

491
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:08,700
Katsunori and I
discussed this.

492
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:14,704
If by any chance
you marry Katsunori,

493
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:18,983
we'll have to build
an addition to the house.

494
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:23,547
That's all right.
This will suit us just fine.

495
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:25,255
Since there'll only be
two of us.

496
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,320
It'll be more convenient.

497
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,188
If I do marry,

498
00:46:31,189 --> 00:46:34,224
we'll have to build
a house for you,

499
00:46:34,225 --> 00:46:35,725
somewhere quiet.

500
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,637
No, I'm fine here.

501
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,641
You're staying?

502
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:44,513
I've lived here a long time.
I will stay here.

503
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:47,113
That's not right.

504
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,481
Then we should build
somewhere else.

505
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:55,515
Where should that be?

506
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:59,649
It can be small but
very modem.

507
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,290
I'd like
a western style house.

508
00:47:04,689 --> 00:47:06,066
What about you?

509
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,698
Don't you like modem?

510
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:11,538
No, I...

511
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:26,517
Yoshiko... if you marry,

512
00:47:27,612 --> 00:47:30,024
you'd prefer to live
just with your husband?

513
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,525
Of course.

514
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:37,893
Oh, is that wrong?

515
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,292
I thought if we got married,

516
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:44,705
we wouldn't be living
with you.

517
00:47:46,631 --> 00:47:50,909
Because if we have to
be mindful of each other

518
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:53,872
then we can't really
enjoy life.

519
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:57,980
Is that what the young
people think these days?

520
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,946
I don't know.

521
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:04,256
But that's my first
condition for marriage.

522
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,995
You really speak your mind.

523
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:14,826
Am I really in the way?

524
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:22,106
I've considered Katsunori
my reason for living.

525
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:28,177
To live apart from Katsunori...

526
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,586
Don't you agree, Katsunori?

527
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,553
If that happens, I...

528
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:46,762
Mother. It's no use
saying that now.

529
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,501
Yoshiko, why don't we
go out. Ginza?

530
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,758
Excuse me.

531
00:49:30,935 --> 00:49:33,939
Are all young people
like that?

532
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,348
I didn't know she was
like that.

533
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,789
Even though she's
the undersecretary's daughter,

534
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:43,452
she's not suitable.

535
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:49,864
If you marry her, what will
happen to me?

536
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:54,266
In this light, Machiko
would have been better.

537
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,036
Machiko never talked
to me like that.

538
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,970
Mother
You say that now?

539
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:12,642
If you feel that way,

540
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:16,284
why didn't you say so
when Machiko was here?

541
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:21,793
It's too late now.

542
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:30,802
Mother. I'm not going to
sacrifice myself for you again.

543
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:57,220
Are you going now?

544
00:50:57,221 --> 00:51:00,361
- Thank you.
- Come again.

545
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:16,012
When you've cleaned up,
you may go to bed.

546
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:34,468
It's too late now.

547
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:55,245
Mother, in the past
I have done my best

548
00:51:55,246 --> 00:51:58,420
to make this family
a happy one.

549
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:02,952
I've worried and made
great efforts

550
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,762
to find ways to please
you both.

551
00:52:04,763 --> 00:52:08,965
But you take everything
I do the wrong way.

552
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,463
You followed me today
in secret.

553
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:15,910
You don't trust me.

554
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:18,405
If you want me to trust you,

555
00:52:18,406 --> 00:52:20,712
why don't you become
a wife I can trust?

556
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:25,847
Dear? What do you
want me to do?

557
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:28,746
How can I satisfy you?

558
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:32,415
Please, tell me.

559
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:34,157
Don't be impertinent.

560
00:52:35,753 --> 00:52:37,755
Why don't you ask
yourself that?

561
00:52:38,756 --> 00:52:41,202
When I say apologize,
do as I say.

562
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,333
Mother has done
everything for me.

563
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:50,676
Unlike you, I'm
her only concern.

564
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:17,497
If he had died then,
I was going to die, too.

565
00:53:17,628 --> 00:53:21,701
That means you saved
two lives, Doctor.

566
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,811
But I was afraid of you.

567
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,706
You ordered me
to keep quiet.

568
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,512
Oh, that!

569
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:33,342
But your prayers
got through to him.

570
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:34,947
Right, Kid.

571
00:53:35,246 --> 00:53:37,226
When you're all better,
I'll take you to the zoo.

572
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:39,490
- Really?
- How nice.

573
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:42,594
I wish I'd been run
over by a car, too.

574
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,193
- I'll be going then.
- Thank you for coming.

575
00:53:46,194 --> 00:53:48,101
- Take care.
- Thank you.

576
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:55,075
He is a great doctor.

577
00:53:57,534 --> 00:53:59,235
Oh, Sister Aya.

578
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,937
Good morning.

579
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:02,839
Was that Doctor Nojima?

580
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,444
I'm so glad you're better.

581
00:54:04,508 --> 00:54:06,385
Where are you going
so early?

582
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,887
Atomiya left for Kyushu
so I saw him off.

583
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,415
Kyushu?

584
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:19,964
Arriving tomorrow morning.
Need to see you. Atomiya.

585
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:50,755
Mrs. Hamaguchi.

586
00:54:51,221 --> 00:54:53,394
The guest in 110
wants to see you.

587
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:56,534
Oh?
Who is it?

588
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,662
She just arrived.

589
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:01,402
She got ill and we
called a doctor.

590
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:03,573
Room 110?

591
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:38,869
Come in.

592
00:55:52,983 --> 00:55:54,963
She was asking for you.

593
00:55:55,619 --> 00:55:58,121
The trip was too much

594
00:55:58,122 --> 00:55:59,965
and she developed
pneumonia.

595
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,492
Her fever's high.

596
00:56:05,729 --> 00:56:07,709
Machiko.

597
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,740
Is that you, Machiko?

598
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:16,579
Mother.

599
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:22,286
Machiko.

600
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,455
Where's Katsunori?

601
00:56:29,687 --> 00:56:31,496
Please call him.

602
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:39,267
Please call his office.

603
00:56:39,696 --> 00:56:42,609
Mother.
You're in Kyushu.

604
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:45,142
You're in Unzen.

605
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:49,040
Oh, yes. I remember.

606
00:56:50,441 --> 00:56:53,581
Machiko. I...

607
00:56:54,211 --> 00:56:58,921
I came to see you.

608
00:57:01,051 --> 00:57:02,962
Katsunori is...

609
00:57:35,686 --> 00:57:37,859
Did you sleep?

610
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,136
Her breathing is easier.

611
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,468
- Her fever's down, too.
- That's good.

612
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:54,303
Why don't you get
some rest?

613
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,977
Thank you.

614
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:08,052
Yes?

615
00:58:08,552 --> 00:58:10,395
Mrs. Hamaguchi.

616
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,795
Mr. Atomiya is outside.

617
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,693
I'll be right back.

618
00:59:13,951 --> 00:59:16,898
Machiko.
It's been a long time.

619
00:59:19,623 --> 00:59:22,103
I have to go back
immediately.

620
00:59:23,827 --> 00:59:25,829
Can you come out
for a few minutes?

621
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:30,168
Yes. I'll tell them.

622
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:38,443
Mother Hamaguchi is here.

623
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,280
Why?

624
00:59:44,281 --> 00:59:45,658
I don't know.

625
00:59:47,651 --> 00:59:49,892
I'll ask someone
to cover for me.

626
01:00:07,804 --> 01:00:11,274
Before I left, I had to
see you again.

627
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:15,782
I wanted to see you, too.

628
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:24,323
Since we're so far apart,
I think of you all the time.

629
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:32,395
And it makes me so sad
sometimes and I get a fever.

630
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:35,377
These days,
I feel so forlorn.

631
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:44,809
When Aya told me
you were leaving

632
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,812
I wanted to go with you

633
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:56,264
to escape from the
pain I was feeling.

634
01:00:56,987 --> 01:00:58,898
I really considered it.

635
01:01:00,057 --> 01:01:03,368
But that's only
wishful thinking.

636
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,073
Machiko.

637
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:10,536
If it was possible,
I want that, too.

638
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,783
But like you,
it's just a wish.

639
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,751
I met Hamaguchi
the other day.

640
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:28,886
We had a long talk
for the first time

641
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:33,789
and I promised him
that I will wait

642
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,896
until he had a change
of heart.

643
01:01:40,397 --> 01:01:42,707
He's not entirely
a bad person.

644
01:01:43,634 --> 01:01:47,275
He can't escape from
the pain of loving you.

645
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:01,821
We're not the only ones
suffering.

646
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:05,057
Look, Machiko.

647
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:09,025
For us to be together
properly,

648
01:02:09,026 --> 01:02:10,972
there's no other way
for me

649
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:15,700
but to wait years
with you in my heart.

650
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:17,940
Even if I die
before that happens,

651
01:02:18,335 --> 01:02:20,281
I'm all right with that.

652
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:34,350
Haruki, because of me,

653
01:02:34,351 --> 01:02:36,262
you've made such
a sad decision.

654
01:02:38,855 --> 01:02:40,596
I am so blessed

655
01:02:42,425 --> 01:02:44,632
as long as you
have me in your heart.

656
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:52,103
But that you should suffer
for a long time because of me...

657
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58,211
Machiko.

658
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:02,846
If we hadn't met

659
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:05,320
perhaps we could have
been happy.

660
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:11,294
But love is not about
whether you're happy now.

661
01:03:12,189 --> 01:03:13,532
It transcends that.

662
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:16,692
No matter how
unhappy I am,

663
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:19,196
I will never stop loving you.

664
01:03:19,696 --> 01:03:20,902
Haruki!

665
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:26,437
Machiko.

666
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:30,515
I don't know when
we'll see each other again.

667
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:35,852
So can you come to
Shimabara to see me off?

668
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,022
Yes.

669
01:03:38,181 --> 01:03:41,355
I have to be back in
Tokyo by tomorrow.

670
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:43,494
I leave the day
after tomorrow.

671
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:45,966
Haruki.

672
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:51,897
Be safe and come home
as soon as you can.

673
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:56,334
You take care, too.

674
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,890
That must be Amakusa.

675
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:17,646
"My beloved."

676
01:05:17,647 --> 01:05:24,826
"Is so far away..."

677
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:30,526
"I call her name"

678
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:40,073
"and call..."

679
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:47,138
"But she does not answer..."

680
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:01,119
"The sadness of echoes..."

681
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:24,880
"We met and we parted"

682
01:06:24,881 --> 01:06:32,988
"the sadness of love"

683
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:39,895
"the sadness,
the happiness"

684
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:47,041
"and the pain..."

685
01:06:47,871 --> 01:06:55,244
"I shout them out..."

686
01:06:55,245 --> 01:07:02,751
"But she does not answer..."

687
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:07,752
"The misery of echoes..."

688
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:49,965
Thank you.
How is she?

689
01:07:49,966 --> 01:07:52,105
She's sleeping.

690
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,243
Oh, Machiko.

691
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,556
When did you get back?

692
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,918
I hear you had a visitor.

693
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:20,894
Yes. I'm sorry
I left you alone.

694
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:27,737
Mr. Atomiya came
from Tokyo.

695
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,272
Atomiya?

696
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:34,737
He's been transferred
to work abroad.

697
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:39,978
Is he here now?

698
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,589
No, he left.

699
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:48,987
He didn't stay?

700
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:54,162
No.

701
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:57,336
I see.

702
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:06,142
Machiko.

703
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:11,977
I hear you took care of me
during the night.

704
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:18,758
Why are you so kind to me?

705
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:25,958
I did awful things to you.

706
01:10:26,923 --> 01:10:29,091
- Why?
- Mother.

707
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:31,493
That's in the past.

708
01:10:31,494 --> 01:10:35,271
Please rest and
get better.

709
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,604
Thank you.

710
01:10:39,569 --> 01:10:42,137
Machiko. I...

711
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:48,817
I came to Unzen
to see you and apologize.

712
01:10:50,580 --> 01:11:00,365
I really should kneel
and beg forgiveness.

713
01:11:01,324 --> 01:11:03,361
But since I'm ill in bed...

714
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:06,439
Mother. That's not...

715
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:10,099
I'm sorry for everything.

716
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:19,083
I felt... I was losing
Katsunori to you.

717
01:11:19,976 --> 01:11:24,379
I was so sad and did
those things to you.

718
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:26,883
I really feel sorry.

719
01:11:28,685 --> 01:11:30,289
Forgive me.

720
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:33,989
Mother, it's not necessary.

721
01:11:33,990 --> 01:11:41,340
No. You tried so hard
to make everyone happy.

722
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:46,812
I forced you to leave.

723
01:11:47,971 --> 01:11:52,852
I wanted to split you
and Katsunori up.

724
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:57,784
I told Katsunori
and he was angry at me.

725
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:01,557
I really am sorry.

726
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:20,705
Machiko.

727
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,640
If at all possible,

728
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:27,809
I want you to come back
to us.

729
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:31,121
I came here to get you.

730
01:12:32,148 --> 01:12:34,355
Please come back.

731
01:12:36,052 --> 01:12:40,728
Please come back to the
Hamaguchi family with me.

732
01:12:43,226 --> 01:12:49,609
And this time, let's make
it a happy family.

733
01:12:51,501 --> 01:12:55,074
You must think
I'm thinking only of myself.

734
01:12:56,239 --> 01:13:00,051
I'm willing to change
my ways.

735
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:04,148
Please. Come back.

736
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:09,622
Or else, Katsunori
will marry someone else.

737
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,763
I'll tell you everything.

738
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:18,128
She's an undersecretary's
daughter.

739
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:21,831
But I don't like her.

740
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:26,045
If she comes,
what will happen to me?

741
01:13:26,536 --> 01:13:28,345
She'll force me out.

742
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:32,884
Please. You'll be
helping me.

743
01:13:33,643 --> 01:13:36,988
Take pity on me
and come back.

744
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:38,886
Please, Machiko.

745
01:13:40,483 --> 01:13:44,319
If only you'd come back...

746
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,665
Katsunori doesn't
care about her.

747
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:54,373
Even now, he has no
intention of divorcing you.

748
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:58,634
For Katsunori's sake,
no, for mine,

749
01:13:58,635 --> 01:14:02,048
please come back.
Please, Machiko.

750
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:07,209
It embarrasses me to
say this now,

751
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:10,054
but I can't help it.

752
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:14,726
Please, Machiko,
forgive me and come back.

753
01:14:16,185 --> 01:14:18,563
- Please.
- Mother.

754
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:25,695
Mother, I don't know
what to say.

755
01:14:26,429 --> 01:14:32,402
But forgive me.
I...

756
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:41,115
I can't go back.

757
01:14:42,578 --> 01:14:46,082
Machiko. Why not?

758
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:56,033
Are you in love
with Mr. Atomiya?

759
01:14:58,127 --> 01:15:03,805
Yes. I can't help
how I feel.

760
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:12,274
But you were married
to Katsunori

761
01:15:12,275 --> 01:15:14,346
feeling the way you feel.

762
01:15:14,644 --> 01:15:19,423
But I don't ever want to
make that mistake again.

763
01:15:19,649 --> 01:15:23,096
Because of that,
everyone became unhappy.

764
01:15:24,087 --> 01:15:27,625
I'm really sorry for
what I've done.

765
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:32,632
I see. I see.

766
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:37,000
I was a fool.

767
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:41,911
I did something
irreparable.

768
01:15:41,938 --> 01:15:45,140
Mother...
Mother...

769
01:15:45,141 --> 01:15:49,021
Please don't cry.

770
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:55,355
If you do, I don't know
what to do.

771
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:03,193
Machiko.
It's all right.

772
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:06,203
I won't ask you anymore.

773
01:16:06,529 --> 01:16:08,509
I was being selfish.

774
01:16:09,665 --> 01:16:16,412
I made you suffer
just by asking.

775
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:25,349
I'm happy just for
your kindness.

776
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:31,528
I'm glad I came.

777
01:16:33,856 --> 01:16:38,100
Because I got to
talk to you.

778
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,134
Mother.

779
01:16:40,696 --> 01:16:46,806
Why I couldn't come around
to how I feel now...

780
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:50,241
That's my only regret.

781
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:56,177
Mother.
Please rest quietly.

782
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,180
Or you'll get sick again.

783
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:00,926
Please, Mother?

784
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:02,961
I'm sorry.

785
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:08,195
You must be tired, too.

786
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:12,432
Go and rest tonight.

787
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,106
Manager!

788
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,568
I hear your mother
went to Kyushu?

789
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:24,967
She went to see
your ex-wife?

790
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,738
I wonder why she went?

791
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:34,374
It looks like she really hated
what I said to her.

792
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:41,750
Then your ex-wife
should come back.

793
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:55,562
You want that, too,
don't you?

794
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,768
No. I...

795
01:19:58,427 --> 01:20:01,772
You can tell me.

796
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:05,033
You were going
to marry me

797
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:08,413
out of despair and to
get back at your wife.

798
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:13,547
And because I'm the
undersecretary's daughter.

799
01:20:14,277 --> 01:20:16,587
Marrying me
will help your career.

800
01:20:20,249 --> 01:20:22,889
Despite your ulterior motive,
I feel attracted to you.

801
01:20:24,854 --> 01:20:29,462
It might be fun to battle
your memories of your wife.

802
01:20:29,992 --> 01:20:31,767
At least I won't be bored.

803
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:37,403
I don't feel love is necessary
for marriage.

804
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,805
Let's dance.

805
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:45,876
I love this kind of life.
Let's dance.

806
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,825
Come on.

807
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:03,431
Yoshiko.

808
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:10,775
I don't mean to be rude,
but I don't think it'll work.

809
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,633
Welcome home.

810
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,598
- Mother's back?
- Yes, a while ago.

811
01:21:53,109 --> 01:21:54,342
Mother.

812
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:58,379
Katsunori, I'm sorry

813
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,382
for leaving without
telling you.

814
01:22:04,987 --> 01:22:07,866
I went to see Machiko.

815
01:22:09,191 --> 01:22:12,866
I hoped she would
come back to us,

816
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:18,937
but I couldn't persuade her.
I'm sorry.

817
01:22:20,803 --> 01:22:25,013
She is a kind good woman.

818
01:22:26,342 --> 01:22:32,054
When I got sick there,
she took care of me.

819
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:43,527
How was Machiko?

820
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:48,403
She looked worn out.

821
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:52,475
I pity her.

822
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,749
Mother.

823
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:11,926
I'll live with you for the
foreseeable future.

824
01:23:15,391 --> 01:23:19,032
I told Yoshiko
we won't get married.

825
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:29,444
Oh, Katsunori.
But why?

826
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,446
Was it because of me?

827
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:39,083
You don't have to
think about me.

828
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:48,402
I'll move out, or do
whatever you want

829
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:51,268
and be a good mother.

830
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:54,305
No, it's not because of you.

831
01:23:56,632 --> 01:23:58,509
It's for my own
personal reasons.

832
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:07,619
I just want to lead
a peaceful life.

833
01:24:09,445 --> 01:24:13,518
Until Machiko's memory
fades from this house.

834
01:24:28,163 --> 01:24:31,065
It was raining
just like tonight,

835
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:32,943
when Machiko left
the first time.

836
01:25:00,863 --> 01:25:02,001
Machiko.

837
01:25:02,698 --> 01:25:04,439
Machiko.

838
01:25:09,838 --> 01:25:11,181
Machiko.

839
01:25:15,978 --> 01:25:17,013
Machiko.

840
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:18,916
Machiko.

841
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:41,512
She was never robust,

842
01:25:41,537 --> 01:25:43,608
but taking care of
a sick person

843
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:45,277
must have taken its toll.

844
01:25:47,843 --> 01:25:49,880
And she's now at
Mr. Nagahashi's?

845
01:25:50,379 --> 01:25:52,252
She's recuperating
at Aso Kogen Hotel

846
01:25:52,253 --> 01:25:54,352
through Mr. Nagahashi's
introduction.

847
01:25:55,918 --> 01:25:59,832
I see.
She's in Aso.

848
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:26,787
Machiko.

849
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:39,761
I heard you were ill.
Why didn't you contact me?

850
01:26:40,763 --> 01:26:43,004
I thought you were
running away from me.

851
01:26:44,099 --> 01:26:45,237
I'm sorry.

852
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:47,314
I saw Mr. Hamaguchi
in Tokyo.

853
01:26:48,504 --> 01:26:52,418
I want to talk to you about it.
Let's find a coffee shop.

854
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:10,157
Poor Hamaguchi.

855
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,001
He got caught
in his own trap.

856
01:27:12,995 --> 01:27:16,738
I thought he would be
more formidable,

857
01:27:16,798 --> 01:27:18,402
so he was
unexpectedly easy.

858
01:27:20,802 --> 01:27:22,336
Come to Tokyo with me,

859
01:27:22,337 --> 01:27:24,008
and we'll see
Hamaguchi together.

860
01:27:24,009 --> 01:27:26,179
He said he'll grant you
a divorce.

861
01:27:26,975 --> 01:27:30,252
Machiko.
You'll finally be free.

862
01:27:33,315 --> 01:27:35,158
What's the matter?

863
01:27:35,884 --> 01:27:38,831
I thought
you'd be overjoyed.

864
01:27:39,088 --> 01:27:40,658
Won't you thank me?

865
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:45,298
I appreciate your kindness.

866
01:27:46,161 --> 01:27:50,364
But I don't want a divorce
on false pretenses.

867
01:27:50,365 --> 01:27:52,311
Why not?

868
01:27:52,834 --> 01:27:55,405
Everything is negotiable.

869
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:59,378
Why aren't you more
proactive for your happiness?

870
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:06,925
I'm doing all I can
in my own way.

871
01:28:07,216 --> 01:28:12,131
But I don't want to go so far
as to trick Katsunori.

872
01:28:16,425 --> 01:28:20,561
However, isn't he ignoring
your civil rights

873
01:28:20,562 --> 01:28:23,397
by saying he won't divorce you

874
01:28:23,398 --> 01:28:25,605
unless you marry anyone
but Atomiya?

875
01:28:26,435 --> 01:28:28,741
So my strategy is the
correct one.

876
01:28:28,742 --> 01:28:30,717
There's nothing
to be ashamed of.

877
01:28:31,707 --> 01:28:38,750
And I'm not lying or
tricking him in the least.

878
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:45,057
That's because I've
asked you to marry me.

879
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:47,731
If you marry me,

880
01:28:47,756 --> 01:28:49,758
then we're not tricking
Hamaguchi.

881
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:54,996
Well? That's what I think.

882
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,806
Is that wrong, Machiko?

883
01:28:57,099 --> 01:28:58,666
Mr. Soejima.

884
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,113
Please let's not discuss
this anymore.

885
01:29:02,171 --> 01:29:06,007
I know you're being kind,

886
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:10,684
but please don't bother
about me anymore.

887
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:18,196
I vowed I'd never do
anything I regret again.

888
01:29:19,821 --> 01:29:24,292
Perhaps, I'm going to die...

889
01:29:27,796 --> 01:29:29,742
I have a feeling...

890
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:32,578
Don't say that, Machiko.

891
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:38,076
I feel so forlorn.

892
01:29:38,707 --> 01:29:41,842
So no matter what
Katsunori does,

893
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:44,847
since he was once
my husband,

894
01:29:45,847 --> 01:29:48,191
I can't bring myself
to deceive him.

895
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:55,058
I think Mr. Atomiya
would say the same.

896
01:30:00,529 --> 01:30:04,773
If I'm to die,
I want to die with a pure heart.

897
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:08,079
Even if I live...

898
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:15,620
So, Mr. Soejima,
I ask you to leave me alone.

899
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:20,815
You may think I'm foolish,

900
01:30:20,816 --> 01:30:24,923
but this is how
I've conducted myself.

901
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:29,133
And I will go on doing so.

902
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:32,265
I see.

903
01:30:34,296 --> 01:30:37,243
You are a beautiful person.

904
01:30:38,834 --> 01:30:41,576
You're beyond my reach.

905
01:30:43,305 --> 01:30:44,784
I'm sorry I butted in.

906
01:30:46,241 --> 01:30:48,517
I'll give you up
here and now.

907
01:30:50,212 --> 01:30:53,523
I won't show my face again.

908
01:30:55,751 --> 01:30:56,923
Machiko?

909
01:30:57,319 --> 01:31:02,462
This Atomiya. He's probably
thinking about you in Europe.

910
01:31:13,435 --> 01:31:16,382
Machiko,
take care of yourself.

911
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:21,842
No matter how distant
this sky is,

912
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:24,016
it is connected to
the sky in Europe.

913
01:31:26,248 --> 01:31:27,921
Bye.

914
01:31:40,295 --> 01:31:43,864
...enduring her sadness,
the Aso Volcano

915
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:46,903
hides red hot flames within.

916
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:50,140
Sitting beneath
the eternal blue skies,

917
01:31:50,141 --> 01:31:54,909
Mt. Aso, with a limitless
reservoir of fire,

918
01:31:54,910 --> 01:32:00,815
surrounded by an outer
crater rim of 82 miles,

919
01:32:00,816 --> 01:32:03,387
this large plain exists

920
01:32:03,418 --> 01:32:06,654
in a large depression
created by an eruption

921
01:32:06,655 --> 01:32:09,329
a long time ago.

922
01:32:13,228 --> 01:32:18,234
The Aso Mountain,
filled with sadness,

923
01:32:19,234 --> 01:32:24,081
conceals red hot flames
within...

924
01:33:22,197 --> 01:33:24,108
Kozue looks like
she's having fun.

925
01:33:26,601 --> 01:33:31,705
Sister Aya, Kozue's had
a hard life because of Toshi,

926
01:33:31,706 --> 01:33:34,084
but now she may find
happiness

927
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:36,146
because of Toshi.

928
01:33:37,312 --> 01:33:39,547
The other day I heard
Dr. Nojima

929
01:33:39,548 --> 01:33:41,084
talking to Uncle Kaseda.

930
01:33:41,583 --> 01:33:43,563
Just like I mended Toshi's
wounds, he said,

931
01:33:43,564 --> 01:33:47,159
if I could, I want to heal
Kozue's emotional wounds.

932
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:48,896
Did he?

933
01:33:51,326 --> 01:33:54,466
Dr. Nojima is very manly.

934
01:33:55,397 --> 01:33:57,343
I'd be glad if that happened.

935
01:34:08,343 --> 01:34:10,345
- Sister Yukie
- Yukie!

936
01:34:10,779 --> 01:34:12,213
I'm sorry we're late.

937
01:34:12,214 --> 01:34:13,716
Isn't Mr. Nishina with you?

938
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:17,284
He said he's had enough
of babysitting.

939
01:34:17,285 --> 01:34:18,491
So he stayed home.

940
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:20,660
Is he starling to be
a demanding husband?

941
01:34:21,656 --> 01:34:24,792
Now that Kayoko has
a mother,

942
01:34:24,793 --> 01:34:26,397
Mr. Nishina isn't worried
anymore.

943
01:34:26,398 --> 01:34:29,864
Kayoko, want to get on
that ride?

944
01:34:30,065 --> 01:34:31,476
Thank you.

945
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:36,680
Sit down.

946
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,787
How is Machiko?

947
01:34:46,014 --> 01:34:48,927
It sound pretty bad.

948
01:34:50,485 --> 01:34:54,023
And she can't stay in
Kyushu forever.

949
01:34:55,423 --> 01:34:57,300
She wants to go back
to Sado.

950
01:34:59,427 --> 01:35:03,204
But that Uncle is
so unreasonable.

951
01:35:04,399 --> 01:35:08,168
So I'm thinking of getting
her into a Tokyo hospital

952
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:12,311
and asked Dr. Nojima
for advice.

953
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:14,582
I see.

954
01:35:16,244 --> 01:35:18,554
I'd like to take care of her...

955
01:35:20,348 --> 01:35:21,554
in Haruki's place.

956
01:35:36,097 --> 01:35:38,771
Auntie? I have to look in
on my restaurant.

957
01:35:38,772 --> 01:35:40,177
Asa, you'll help?

958
01:35:41,069 --> 01:35:43,777
Thank you, Aya, for being
here every day.

959
01:35:43,778 --> 01:35:47,274
Since Yukie's here, too.
You get some rest.

960
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:51,052
Thank you.
What do you think, Aya...

961
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,956
Will Machiko be all right?

962
01:35:56,084 --> 01:36:00,621
She wasn't strong
physically and emotionally

963
01:36:00,622 --> 01:36:02,761
even when she was little.

964
01:36:03,024 --> 01:36:06,437
And these several years
have taken their toll.

965
01:36:14,435 --> 01:36:16,142
Poor girl.

966
01:36:19,107 --> 01:36:20,347
How do you feel?

967
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:23,921
Please get better soon.

968
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:32,291
Whenever I hear about you,
I feel so remorseful.

969
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:36,098
I've wanted to
apologize to you.

970
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:46,641
I'm the real reason
you're so unhappy.

971
01:36:47,035 --> 01:36:49,572
That's not so.

972
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:56,452
The dark shadow I cast
has fallen on you.

973
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:03,717
At that time, I had been
betrayed by the one I trusted

974
01:37:03,718 --> 01:37:06,631
and I couldn't trust
even my brother, Haruki.

975
01:37:08,489 --> 01:37:12,437
Machiko.
Please get well soon

976
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:15,468
and wait for Haruki
to return.

977
01:37:17,399 --> 01:37:24,009
I need you two
to be happy.

978
01:37:27,241 --> 01:37:32,623
I wonder how Haruki is?

979
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:37,657
He's probably
worried about you.

980
01:37:39,921 --> 01:37:41,662
I let him know.

981
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:02,689
Thank you.

982
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:04,014
Excuse me.

983
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:08,048
Machiko.

984
01:38:08,049 --> 01:38:10,393
Katsunori called.

985
01:38:11,553 --> 01:38:15,592
He said he wants to come
see you tonight.

986
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:18,767
He says he must see you.

987
01:38:19,661 --> 01:38:21,163
Shall I refuse?

988
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:25,571
- No...
- You'll see him?

989
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,160
I was shocked to hear
from Mr. Nagahashi

990
01:38:41,161 --> 01:38:43,527
that you were very ill.

991
01:38:44,452 --> 01:38:48,161
I know I don't have the
right to visit you.

992
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:51,737
Machiko.

993
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:56,366
I brought this today.

994
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,670
This is the divorce papers
you were waiting for.

995
01:39:03,872 --> 01:39:05,442
I've signed it.

996
01:39:10,979 --> 01:39:13,960
I'm sorry I made you suffer
for a long time.

997
01:39:17,318 --> 01:39:23,056
I learned two days ago
from Soejima's letter

998
01:39:23,057 --> 01:39:27,728
that you refused to trick
me into getting a divorce.

999
01:39:27,729 --> 01:39:29,299
I was really happy.

1000
01:39:31,866 --> 01:39:33,106
Machiko.

1001
01:39:34,336 --> 01:39:37,647
Please forgive me
for what I've done.

1002
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:41,611
That's not necessary.

1003
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:48,522
I was the one who did
inexcusable things.

1004
01:39:49,584 --> 01:39:52,360
But it couldn't be helped.

1005
01:39:53,989 --> 01:39:58,961
It was no one's fault.
No one could help it.

1006
01:40:06,634 --> 01:40:11,310
I couldn't control my feelings
when it came to you.

1007
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:15,120
I didn't want to let you go,
no matter what.

1008
01:40:17,144 --> 01:40:19,279
I'm really amazed that

1009
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:22,193
recently I've become
so rational about you.

1010
01:40:24,152 --> 01:40:26,029
Perhaps it was the time.

1011
01:40:27,655 --> 01:40:32,434
Or it was the purity of
you and Atomiya's love.

1012
01:40:34,062 --> 01:40:36,736
In any case, I'm sorry.

1013
01:40:41,436 --> 01:40:46,706
I've been able to go back
to the same feeling I had

1014
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:48,744
when I took you to
look for Atomiya.

1015
01:40:51,212 --> 01:40:54,557
If I love you, I should
wish for your happiness.

1016
01:40:56,351 --> 01:40:58,160
We've gone back
to square one.

1017
01:40:59,687 --> 01:41:03,290
We took a very hard
and torturous detour,

1018
01:41:03,291 --> 01:41:07,171
but please blame
human folly.

1019
01:41:08,829 --> 01:41:16,338
Dear? When you say that,
I don't know what to do.

1020
01:41:18,739 --> 01:41:22,050
But I'm really glad.

1021
01:41:23,678 --> 01:41:28,149
That the day has come
and you truly forgive me.

1022
01:41:29,383 --> 01:41:34,457
I can die anytime now
without regrets.

1023
01:41:35,323 --> 01:41:36,825
Don't say that, Machiko.

1024
01:41:36,826 --> 01:41:39,668
Be strong.
Your life has just begun.

1025
01:41:40,828 --> 01:41:44,799
Get well soon and wait
for Atomiya to return.

1026
01:41:46,334 --> 01:41:48,473
Yes. I will.

1027
01:41:51,473 --> 01:41:54,682
I hear you took good care
of Mother.

1028
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:56,854
She was very happy.

1029
01:41:57,345 --> 01:41:59,951
How is she?

1030
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:04,021
She's fine and asked me
to send her regards.

1031
01:42:05,253 --> 01:42:09,326
Mother. She's become
so kind.

1032
01:42:10,892 --> 01:42:12,530
We're all good people.

1033
01:42:13,194 --> 01:42:15,196
Why did that have to happen?

1034
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:18,539
Why?

1035
01:42:20,835 --> 01:42:24,510
I wonder why.

1036
01:42:40,455 --> 01:42:43,265
I'll give this to your aunt.

1037
01:42:44,558 --> 01:42:46,970
Machiko what's the matter?

1038
01:42:49,464 --> 01:42:53,066
Aunt. I'm sorry
this is so late,

1039
01:42:53,067 --> 01:42:54,774
but it's the divorce papers.

1040
01:42:55,470 --> 01:42:57,143
Divorce papers!

1041
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:02,579
- Machiko.
- Aunt.

1042
01:43:06,280 --> 01:43:10,490
Katsunori. Why didn't
you come sooner?

1043
01:43:11,953 --> 01:43:15,491
You made her ill with
all the suffering.

1044
01:43:16,157 --> 01:43:17,932
Please don't blame
Katsunori.

1045
01:43:18,893 --> 01:43:24,664
Dear? Please find
a good wife.

1046
01:43:24,665 --> 01:43:29,273
And please find happiness.

1047
01:43:30,004 --> 01:43:31,483
Please?

1048
01:43:31,539 --> 01:43:34,850
Perhaps we may never
meet again, Machiko.

1049
01:43:35,342 --> 01:43:37,219
Please get well soon.

1050
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:40,385
I'll be going then.

1051
01:43:46,921 --> 01:43:48,229
Aunt.

1052
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:49,494
It's time.

1053
01:43:51,192 --> 01:43:53,433
Machiko.
Machiko.

1054
01:43:56,764 --> 01:43:58,004
Machiko.

1055
01:44:01,636 --> 01:44:04,207
It took such a long time.

1056
01:44:05,606 --> 01:44:08,141
But once you get well,

1057
01:44:08,142 --> 01:44:11,316
all that's left is to wait
for Atomiya to return.

1058
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,920
You'll be happy very soon.

1059
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:19,226
So be strong, Machiko.

1060
01:44:23,624 --> 01:44:25,262
But, Aunt,

1061
01:44:26,227 --> 01:44:31,370
do you really think
I'll find happiness?

1062
01:44:32,033 --> 01:44:33,512
What are you saying?

1063
01:44:34,535 --> 01:44:38,071
Isn't that why you've suffered
for so long?

1064
01:44:38,072 --> 01:44:42,817
But maybe
that day will never come.

1065
01:44:43,744 --> 01:44:46,520
- I may just...
- Machiko.

1066
01:44:46,981 --> 01:44:49,461
You're so pessimistic.

1067
01:44:50,385 --> 01:44:53,559
That's why unhappiness
follows you.

1068
01:44:54,255 --> 01:45:00,137
So, be strong.
Be strong of will.

1069
01:45:01,462 --> 01:45:04,443
If you're discouraged
you can't get better.

1070
01:45:04,933 --> 01:45:06,469
You hear, Machiko?

1071
01:45:12,507 --> 01:45:14,748
I want to see Haruki
one more time.

1072
01:45:16,177 --> 01:45:18,953
It's only been three months
since he went away.

1073
01:45:19,747 --> 01:45:23,285
I wonder when he'll return.
Aunt?

1074
01:45:27,589 --> 01:45:31,036
Open the curtain.
I want to see the city.

1075
01:45:32,526 --> 01:45:36,633
I've been in bed ever since
I came back to Tokyo.

1076
01:45:38,365 --> 01:45:41,437
Please, Aunt.
Open the curtain.

1077
01:45:54,615 --> 01:45:56,720
The lights are beautiful.

1078
01:45:57,585 --> 01:45:59,565
Can you see Sukiya Bridge?

1079
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,827
Yes, I can.

1080
01:46:28,983 --> 01:46:31,652
What? You called me
for that?

1081
01:46:31,653 --> 01:46:33,428
I'm sorry.

1082
01:46:34,522 --> 01:46:38,325
Editor, can't you do
something?

1083
01:46:38,326 --> 01:46:40,670
I want them to see each
other one more time.

1084
01:46:40,671 --> 01:46:44,031
But Atomiya's not just
there for us,

1085
01:46:44,032 --> 01:46:46,137
he's a special reporter
for the newspaper.

1086
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:47,971
It won't be simple.

1087
01:46:48,636 --> 01:46:53,006
And he'll have to use his
own money to get here.

1088
01:46:53,007 --> 01:46:54,611
I know that.

1089
01:46:55,009 --> 01:47:00,313
Even if I have to sell
this shop, I'll...

1090
01:47:00,314 --> 01:47:02,182
Hey. That's magnanimous.

1091
01:47:02,183 --> 01:47:04,254
Please, get him home.

1092
01:47:05,052 --> 01:47:07,032
If something happens
to Machiko,

1093
01:47:07,033 --> 01:47:08,591
it would be too sad.

1094
01:47:12,059 --> 01:47:15,195
But why are you
so concerned

1095
01:47:15,196 --> 01:47:18,871
about Atomiya and
this girl?

1096
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:20,674
It's curious.

1097
01:47:22,069 --> 01:47:24,379
I bet it's you who wants
to see Atomiya.

1098
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:34,054
Editor.
Yes, I love Atomiya, too.

1099
01:47:35,315 --> 01:47:39,024
But the love they have
for each other is special.

1100
01:47:40,187 --> 01:47:42,827
I can never be like that.

1101
01:47:47,027 --> 01:47:51,476
Perhaps I'm asking them
to do what I can't.

1102
01:47:53,167 --> 01:47:57,274
It's sad when I think about it,
but I'm fine with it.

1103
01:47:58,272 --> 01:47:59,376
I see.

1104
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:02,775
Atomiya is a lucky man

1105
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:04,816
to have a woman like you
that much in love with him.

1106
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:08,815
When you called,

1107
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:10,454
I thought you were going
to say yes to me

1108
01:48:10,455 --> 01:48:12,761
so I even shaved.

1109
01:48:13,754 --> 01:48:15,290
You're joking.

1110
01:48:19,793 --> 01:48:22,795
The folks in Sado
sent this,

1111
01:48:22,796 --> 01:48:24,969
so please take it home
to your wife.

1112
01:48:25,900 --> 01:48:27,709
Oh, thank you.

1113
01:48:29,570 --> 01:48:33,108
You're a good woman.

1114
01:48:34,108 --> 01:48:36,486
If I wasn't married,
I'd be in love with you.

1115
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:38,218
Thank you.

1116
01:48:40,481 --> 01:48:42,825
I'll do what I can
about Atomiya.

1117
01:48:43,084 --> 01:48:45,719
- Please.
- Oh, well.

1118
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,631
I'll walk you out.

1119
01:48:47,955 --> 01:48:50,265
I want to give her
the good news.

1120
01:49:00,167 --> 01:49:02,306
Machiko!

1121
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:04,137
Aya.

1122
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:05,617
What's wrong, Auntie?

1123
01:49:07,174 --> 01:49:08,312
Machiko's missing.

1124
01:49:09,176 --> 01:49:11,486
Machiko?
Machiko.

1125
01:49:38,772 --> 01:49:40,683
Haruki.

1126
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:27,528
Machiko.

1127
01:50:33,227 --> 01:50:35,661
Machiko,
what are you doing?

1128
01:50:35,662 --> 01:50:37,539
You shouldn't be out here.

1129
01:50:38,198 --> 01:50:41,509
Aya, I'm sorry!

1130
01:50:43,204 --> 01:50:50,179
I wanted to come here
once again before I died.

1131
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:53,318
Machiko, Machiko.

1132
01:50:55,349 --> 01:50:56,692
Machiko.

1133
01:51:19,073 --> 01:51:21,019
Well?

1134
01:51:23,911 --> 01:51:27,256
Dr. Nojima,
is she dying?

1135
01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:30,627
It's hard to say.

1136
01:51:32,453 --> 01:51:35,127
But it's all about
her will to live.

1137
01:51:35,723 --> 01:51:38,135
How much she wants
to get well...

1138
01:51:39,293 --> 01:51:41,967
I'll ask the hospital director
to take special care.

1139
01:51:42,229 --> 01:51:43,708
Thank you.

1140
01:51:47,468 --> 01:51:51,746
Why did Atomiya have to
go so far away?

1141
01:52:13,661 --> 01:52:15,538
Aunt.

1142
01:52:16,964 --> 01:52:22,607
Haruki is waiting
at Sukiya Bridge.

1143
01:52:23,971 --> 01:52:27,282
I have to go.

1144
01:52:29,176 --> 01:52:32,123
Machiko,
try to be strong.

1145
01:53:27,868 --> 01:53:29,711
Haruki.

1146
01:53:31,138 --> 01:53:34,210
I'm getting married
tomorrow.

1147
01:53:41,148 --> 01:53:42,991
After we parted,

1148
01:53:43,384 --> 01:53:45,330
I couldn't see you
on either the six-month

1149
01:53:45,331 --> 01:53:47,128
or one-year anniversary.

1150
01:53:48,188 --> 01:53:50,600
And now that I'm finally
able to see you,

1151
01:53:50,601 --> 01:53:52,161
it's good-bye.

1152
01:53:53,393 --> 01:54:01,471
Haruki, I didn't
intend to see you again.

1153
01:54:02,369 --> 01:54:06,940
But before I got married,

1154
01:54:06,941 --> 01:54:11,243
I wanted to see this
bridge full of memories

1155
01:54:11,244 --> 01:54:12,917
one more time.

1156
01:54:13,814 --> 01:54:18,317
And if... if you were here,

1157
01:54:18,318 --> 01:54:22,596
I wanted to get
a glimpse of you.

1158
01:54:32,599 --> 01:54:37,548
Thank you.
I'm glad you came.

1159
01:54:40,273 --> 01:54:44,483
I hope you'll be
very happy.

1160
01:54:47,381 --> 01:54:52,455
Haruki, perhaps
you're already married?

1161
01:54:58,058 --> 01:55:02,006
Good-bye then.

1162
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:41,178
Haruki.

1163
01:56:01,054 --> 01:56:02,897
Machiko.

1164
01:57:00,046 --> 01:57:01,957
A phone call for you.

1165
01:57:11,792 --> 01:57:15,934
Hello?
Oh, Editor?

1166
01:57:16,964 --> 01:57:19,774
Is that true?

1167
01:57:20,634 --> 01:57:22,978
So he left yesterday.

1168
01:57:24,738 --> 01:57:25,738
I see.

1169
01:57:27,107 --> 01:57:28,643
Yes.

1170
01:57:29,343 --> 01:57:32,290
Yes.
Thank you.

1171
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:54,102
- Atomiya's coming home.
- He is?

1172
01:57:55,135 --> 01:57:56,512
Machiko?

1173
01:57:56,736 --> 01:57:59,478
Machiko.
Atomiya's coming home.

1174
01:58:03,377 --> 01:58:07,257
Machiko.
Atomiya's coming.

1175
01:58:14,087 --> 01:58:15,998
Machiko.

1176
01:58:21,395 --> 01:58:23,272
Haruki.

1177
01:58:37,911 --> 01:58:40,084
Machiko.
Be strong.

1178
01:58:40,547 --> 01:58:42,493
Atomiya will be here tonight.

1179
01:58:42,749 --> 01:58:43,750
Machiko.

1180
01:59:32,065 --> 01:59:34,272
Machiko.

1181
02:00:00,293 --> 02:00:02,569
Machiko.

1182
02:00:48,908 --> 02:00:51,477
- Atomiya.
- Aya.

1183
02:00:51,478 --> 02:00:53,754
- Welcome home.
- How's Machiko?

1184
02:00:54,414 --> 02:00:57,088
She's okay.
Go see her.

1185
02:00:57,117 --> 02:00:59,097
Please go to her.

1186
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:12,002
Atomiya.
Please praise her.

1187
02:01:13,733 --> 02:01:17,306
Machiko won her fight.

1188
02:01:17,971 --> 02:01:19,279
Machiko.

1189
02:01:28,014 --> 02:01:31,188
Let's leave them alone.

1190
02:01:42,695 --> 02:01:45,005
Haruki.

1191
02:01:48,935 --> 02:01:49,970
Machiko.

1192
02:01:52,505 --> 02:01:53,711
Welcome home.

1193
02:02:01,782 --> 02:02:03,284
Machiko.

1194
02:02:04,785 --> 02:02:07,019
Forgive me.

1195
02:02:07,020 --> 02:02:09,227
I didn't know
you were so ill.

1196
02:02:10,390 --> 02:02:13,058
I'm sorry I'm like this

1197
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:16,006
when you came
such a long way.

1198
02:02:16,630 --> 02:02:18,632
But I'm glad
you're alive.

1199
02:02:20,033 --> 02:02:22,877
If you had died,
what was I supposed to do?

1200
02:02:23,236 --> 02:02:28,515
Haruki, I won't die.

1201
02:02:30,277 --> 02:02:34,248
I'll be with you always.

1202
02:02:35,682 --> 02:02:36,956
Machiko.

1203
02:02:39,619 --> 02:02:43,897
This time I'll
never let you go.

1204
02:02:46,059 --> 02:02:49,563
What was all that
suffering about?

1205
02:02:52,765 --> 02:02:58,408
Machiko, rest in my arms.

1206
02:03:00,573 --> 02:03:04,109
And get healthy again

1207
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:05,783
so we can built
a happy life together.

1208
02:03:10,083 --> 02:03:16,789
I can't believe we're
here together.

1209
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:19,236
It seems like a dream.

1210
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:25,365
I'm so happy.

1211
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:39,620
Look the dawn is breaking.

1212
02:03:42,616 --> 02:03:46,154
Don't worry
and go to sleep.

1213
02:03:47,621 --> 02:03:49,623
Haruki.

1214
02:04:14,414 --> 02:04:19,921
Oblivion is to completely
forget...

1215
02:04:46,012 --> 02:04:51,928
THE END
