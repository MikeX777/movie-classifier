2
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,385
Excuse me.

3
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,565
Are you all right?

4
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:08,485
Am I beautiful?

5
00:01:26,529 --> 00:01:27,829
What?

6
00:01:33,477 --> 00:01:34,973
Morning, Claire.

7
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:37,391
Good morning.

8
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:39,263
Everything OK?

9
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,783
What?

10
00:01:40,785 --> 00:01:43,373
You're usually up by now.

11
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,845
Bad dream?

12
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:46,147
Yeah.

13
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,013
Her mouth was cut.

14
00:01:54,015 --> 00:01:55,570
On both sides.

15
00:01:57,455 --> 00:01:59,289
It was dark.

16
00:02:02,575 --> 00:02:04,873
I saw her.

17
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,699
I don't know.

18
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,375
Do you know anything?

19
00:02:09,245 --> 00:02:12,490
This woman, was she
wearing a red dress?

20
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:15,003
A dress?

21
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,973
Maybe.

22
00:02:17,975 --> 00:02:19,513
The slit-mouth woman.

23
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,143
Slit-mouth woman?

24
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:22,967
What's that?

25
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:24,883
It's an urban legend
from Japan that I've been

26
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:28,043
researching for my masters.

27
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:32,123
They say her dress
is red from blood.

28
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:33,353
Urban legend?

29
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:35,439
So it's not real?

30
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:36,933
Don't know.

31
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:42,433
There are various stories and
accounts of sights as well.

32
00:02:42,435 --> 00:02:44,573
This is what you
study in school?

33
00:02:44,575 --> 00:02:46,413
I mean, I don't know.

34
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:52,209
Well, I went to Japan to
research the urban legend.

35
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:54,492
Why are you having this dream?

36
00:02:54,494 --> 00:02:55,033
I don't know.

37
00:02:55,035 --> 00:02:56,483
You tell me.

38
00:02:56,485 --> 00:03:01,053
I mean, I hadn't even heard
of the slit-mouth woman.

39
00:03:03,825 --> 00:03:05,093
That's Monica.

40
00:03:05,095 --> 00:03:05,793
Thanks, Sarah.

41
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,095
Gotta go.

42
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:16,203
Hi.

43
00:03:16,205 --> 00:03:17,272
Good morning.

44
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:17,813
Good morning.

45
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:18,679
Let's go.

46
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,980
Yeah.

47
00:03:23,275 --> 00:03:26,713
Yeah, I had this really
weird dream last night.

48
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:27,313
Yeah?

49
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:30,435
I hear there's a rumor
going around about it.

50
00:03:30,437 --> 00:03:32,373
What?

51
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,053
Why haven't I heard about this?

52
00:03:34,055 --> 00:03:36,495
I've only heard of
it recently too.

53
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:39,863
Well, but you should
be careful, though.

54
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:40,853
Or what?

55
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,823
If you actually see
the slit-mouth woman,

56
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:43,873
they say you die.

57
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:44,373
Ugh.

58
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,573
Why would you say that?

59
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:48,518
Anyway, mine's only in my dream.

60
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,393
It's just a rumor.

61
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:52,158
There are ways for
not getting killed.

62
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,643
How?

63
00:03:53,645 --> 00:03:55,323
If you're asked if
she's beautiful,

64
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:57,513
you say she's average.

65
00:03:57,515 --> 00:03:58,315
That's it?

66
00:03:58,317 --> 00:03:59,553
Mhm.

67
00:03:59,555 --> 00:04:02,643
And apparently, the slit-mouth
woman has two other sisters.

68
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:03,453
Really?

69
00:04:03,455 --> 00:04:05,243
So there are three of them?

70
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,033
Mhm.

71
00:04:06,035 --> 00:04:07,663
Just like our family.

72
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:08,163
Wait.

73
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,246
What does this have to do
with not getting killed?

74
00:04:10,248 --> 00:04:11,973
I thought it was
just you and Sarah.

75
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,403
No, I have another elder sister.

76
00:04:14,405 --> 00:04:15,493
Really?

77
00:04:15,495 --> 00:04:18,332
That's more news to me
than the slit-mouth woman.

78
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:21,122
No, I don't know much about her.

79
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:23,523
My dad's first
wife was Japanese.

80
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:26,073
So you don't know anything
about your sister?

81
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:26,853
I mean, no.

82
00:04:26,855 --> 00:04:29,993
They put her up for adoption
for before I was even born.

83
00:04:29,995 --> 00:04:30,993
You never met her?

84
00:04:30,995 --> 00:04:33,207
I don't even know
what she looks like.

85
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:35,373
I mean, I've heard she had
taken her mother's blood,

86
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,375
but she looks more
Japanese than Sarah or me.

87
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:39,385
She was also raised in Japan.

88
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:43,333
What?

89
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:45,043
Claire.

90
00:04:45,045 --> 00:04:45,643
Claire!

91
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:46,153
Yeah, yeah.

92
00:04:46,155 --> 00:04:46,963
Sorry.

93
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:50,941
I thought I saw
something over there.

94
00:04:50,943 --> 00:04:54,021
It was nothing.

95
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,323
Monica?

96
00:04:58,015 --> 00:04:59,315
Monica?

97
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:11,291
Monica?

98
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,973
Monica?

99
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,275
Monica?

100
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:23,766
Monica?

101
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:29,754
Monica!

102
00:05:34,942 --> 00:05:37,239
Monica, where are you?

103
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,700
Monica!

104
00:06:05,381 --> 00:06:08,373
Monica.

105
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,868
Monica.

106
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,362
Monica.

107
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:14,664
Ugh!

108
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:22,369
Monica, why, why?

109
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,359
Monica?

110
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,661
Monica?

111
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:22,353
In our next story,
in Westwood, it

112
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:24,923
has been reported that the
gruesome crime took place

113
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:26,423
in less than a minute.

114
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,643
The weapon used has not
been found, however,

115
00:07:28,645 --> 00:07:32,753
the wounds on the victim suggest
it was a sickle-type object

116
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:33,983
that was used.

117
00:07:33,985 --> 00:07:35,843
There are no other casualties.

118
00:07:35,845 --> 00:07:37,028
LAPD...

119
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:45,363
Claire, maybe when things calm
down, tomorrow or the next day,

120
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:48,488
will you come with me someplace?

121
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:49,745
What?

122
00:07:49,747 --> 00:07:51,203
I think what happened
has something

123
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:55,333
to do with the dream you had,
about the slit-mouth woman.

124
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:57,683
I think my professor
may be able to help.

125
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,905
What are you talking about?

126
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:06,873
You know, we may be able to
find something out about Monica.

127
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:08,603
There's a chance.

128
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:11,703
This is what we research.

129
00:08:11,705 --> 00:08:14,525
Well, what your
research is insane.

130
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:51,203
I knew a time like
this would come.

131
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:54,923
I didn't expect it to
be so soon, though.

132
00:08:54,925 --> 00:08:56,343
I'm predicting the
Japanese people

133
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:58,193
who come to the
States are affecting

134
00:08:58,195 --> 00:09:01,013
the phenomenon in some way.

135
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:03,653
I'm sure Sarah has already
told you what you saw

136
00:09:03,655 --> 00:09:07,313
was a slit-mouth
woman, kuchisake-onna.

137
00:09:07,315 --> 00:09:10,673
Your friend was probably
killed by the slit-mouth woman,

138
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:16,993
but no one knows exactly what
or who she is, even in Japan.

139
00:09:16,995 --> 00:09:20,513
What do you mean, you knew
a time like this would come?

140
00:09:20,515 --> 00:09:22,253
Recently, we've
noticed an increase

141
00:09:22,255 --> 00:09:25,343
in Japanese urban legend rumors.

142
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:27,263
It was a matter of
time before something

143
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,693
like this manifested itself.

144
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,343
The professor's
original research

145
00:09:31,345 --> 00:09:32,753
was about how rumors spread.

146
00:09:32,755 --> 00:09:35,723
But with this new
Japanese influence,

147
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:38,783
we've widened our research.

148
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:41,163
I don't really care.

149
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:44,005
I just wanna know why
was Monica killed?

150
00:09:44,007 --> 00:09:45,743
Claire.

151
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:49,253
It's only recently the
killings have happened.

152
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,563
Something as gruesome
as your friend's death

153
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:53,143
never occurred before.

154
00:09:53,145 --> 00:09:55,793
It's only in the last few weeks.

155
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,493
It's not just the
slit-mouth woman.

156
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:01,943
There are other urban
legends, such as Kokkuri-san,

157
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:04,885
which has been known to
cause deaths as well.

158
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,811
Kokkuri-san, please come.

159
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:41,283
Kokkuri-san,
Kokkuri-san, please come.

160
00:10:41,285 --> 00:10:45,747
Kokkuri-san,
Kokkuri-san, please come.

161
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:49,219
Kokkuri-san,
Kokkuri-san, please come.

162
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:52,691
Kokkuri-san,
Kokkuri-san, please come.

163
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:56,965
Kokkuri-san,
Kokkuri-san, please come.

164
00:11:02,117 --> 00:11:03,909
That's him.

165
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,023
Kokkuri-san, is Yuri in love?

166
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,325
Hey!

167
00:11:21,025 --> 00:11:26,545
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san, will
I be together with this person?

168
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:10,013
What I'm about to
tell you is a story

169
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:14,653
of three women who worked at a
Maid Cafe called "Butterfly."

170
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:18,353
Kate is blonde, beautiful,
mysterious, a little cold

171
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:19,633
at times.

172
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:21,383
Mint, the manager,
always has to remind

173
00:12:21,385 --> 00:12:23,603
Kate of her customer skills.

174
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:25,583
Lisa Lisa is a great girl.

175
00:12:25,585 --> 00:12:27,853
Good service, always
cheerful to everyone.

176
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:32,303
She has many secret admirers
among the customers.

177
00:12:32,305 --> 00:12:35,113
But Yuri is by far the best.

178
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:38,525
I mean, she is the perfect
embodiment of what a maid is.

179
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:45,937
But her smile is gone forever.

180
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:52,563
She was stabbed to death
in front of Butterfly

181
00:12:52,565 --> 00:12:54,259
in her maid's outfit.

182
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:09,453
I heard the news three
days after it happened.

183
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,465
We were enjoying another
peaceful, regular day.

184
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,353
You say that, and
then she does...

185
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:23,183
No way she's gonna like
that response, man.

186
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,003
Yeah, she is.

187
00:13:24,005 --> 00:13:25,162
Watch, watch, watch.

188
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:25,703
There you go.

189
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:26,203
There.

190
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:26,868
See?

191
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,367
What?

192
00:13:27,369 --> 00:13:28,253
Yeah.

193
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:29,678
Oh, now you go to beach level?

194
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,593
Yeah, the beach level's coming.

195
00:13:31,595 --> 00:13:32,813
Hey, Nobby.

196
00:13:32,815 --> 00:13:34,093
Oh, wait, Nobby.

197
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:36,543
I was just getting to the
final stage with Yuri-chan.

198
00:13:36,545 --> 00:13:38,413
I was just telling
Rob how it's done.

199
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,935
You... you guys don't know?

200
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:44,433
Yuri's dead.

201
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,465
Seems like an unlikely ending!

202
00:13:47,645 --> 00:13:49,343
Not this Yuri!

203
00:13:49,345 --> 00:13:51,345
The Yuri from Butterfly.

204
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,590
Look, it's Yuri's ihai.

205
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:09,923
We should place incense, though.

206
00:14:09,925 --> 00:14:11,783
That's what you
do, though, right?

207
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:14,763
Yes, in front of the ihai.

208
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,713
Pray for the dead.

209
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:18,123
No, no, no, no, no, no.

210
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,297
I've had too many scary
encounters with Kate.

211
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:20,963
Are you kidding?

212
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,933
I can't just go in there.

213
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:26,228
She looks down on me!

214
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,003
I'm pretty sure she's a lesbian.

215
00:14:28,005 --> 00:14:29,213
And a sadist.

216
00:14:29,215 --> 00:14:30,203
She's an ultra-sadist.

217
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,383
I'll be having a conversation
with Yuri-chan, having

218
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:34,133
a pleasant time, and
then she'll come over

219
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:36,973
just to ruin everything, 'cause
she loves to see people suffer.

220
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:40,330
The giant bing!

221
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:48,029
Here for Yuri?

222
00:14:48,031 --> 00:14:49,331
Come in.

223
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,539
Kate, I just got a
call from the police.

224
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,048
It's Lisa Lisa now.

225
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,253
She's dead.

226
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:20,753
What?

227
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:22,663
Lisa Lisa?

228
00:15:22,665 --> 00:15:24,603
Is it connected to Yuri?

229
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:26,073
What's going on?

230
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:27,293
How should I know?

231
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,413
Well, they don't know
the cause of death yet.

232
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:32,089
It's an unusual death.

233
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:34,015
She may have been murdered.

234
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:06,209
Hey, wait.

235
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:08,614
Wait, wait.

236
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:09,197
You need help?

237
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,995
Where you going?

238
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,153
I know there's something between
Yuri's death and Lisa Lisa's

239
00:16:41,155 --> 00:16:42,615
death, right?

240
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,433
We all really liked Yuri.

241
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,383
Well, not just Yuri, but all
maids from Butterfly Cafe

242
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:49,783
are great.

243
00:16:49,785 --> 00:16:53,173
But... but if something
was going on,

244
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:55,883
if... if Yuri and Lisa Lisa
got involved into something,

245
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:57,633
I mean, I don't know.

246
00:16:57,635 --> 00:16:58,938
We... we just want to help.

247
00:16:58,940 --> 00:16:59,890
And you too.

248
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:01,723
What if something were
to happen to you too?

249
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:03,972
I know you're thinking that
Yuri and Lisa Lisa's death

250
00:17:03,974 --> 00:17:05,322
are connected in some way.

251
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,673
It may not be obvious, but I
have this really good skill

252
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:08,173
about me.

253
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,453
I can... I can solve things.

254
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,489
I mean, my game skills
allow me to... you know,

255
00:17:11,491 --> 00:17:14,415
the mysteries that I go
through with my girl games?

256
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:19,665
Shut the fuck up!

257
00:18:03,276 --> 00:18:06,268
Angie.

258
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,803
Kate.

259
00:18:08,805 --> 00:18:10,153
I don't know what to do.

260
00:18:10,155 --> 00:18:12,853
We were just hanging out and...
and smoking pot, you know?

261
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,503
And then I went to the bathroom.

262
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:17,543
I heard Lisa Lisa start to
yell, and she ran outside.

263
00:18:17,545 --> 00:18:19,513
And then I came back
and no one was there,

264
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:24,473
and she was in terrible shape.

265
00:18:24,475 --> 00:18:26,493
No...

266
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:30,023
Oi, can you show us again
what happened inside?

267
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:30,553
Yeah.

268
00:18:30,555 --> 00:18:32,853
Yeah, sure.

269
00:18:32,855 --> 00:18:34,553
Bye, Kate.

270
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:35,683
Angie!

271
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:39,493
You know, she said your
friend's name when she went out,

272
00:18:39,495 --> 00:18:41,195
your Japanese friend.

273
00:18:52,562 --> 00:18:53,945
You mean Yuri.

274
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:18,419
We went to this really
weird warehouse,

275
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:19,933
and she looked at it.

276
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:22,653
And, guys, I think
Kate's in trouble.

277
00:19:22,655 --> 00:19:24,873
So that's how it is?

278
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,923
Yuri-chan to Kate?

279
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:29,593
Yuri-chan and Lisa
Lisa are dead.

280
00:19:29,595 --> 00:19:31,753
And you just move on to Kate?

281
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,449
I didn't know you
could be so heartless!

282
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:34,573
What are you talking about?

283
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,583
I just wanna know
why Yuri was killed.

284
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:37,363
And?

285
00:19:37,365 --> 00:19:38,453
And what?

286
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:41,143
And you can't do
anything about it.

287
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:42,913
It's the cops' jobs now, OK?

288
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:43,973
Leave it to them.

289
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:45,163
It's a curse.

290
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,683
Yuri-chan was Japanese.

291
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:49,303
She could have put
a curse on someone

292
00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:52,043
with Kokkuri-san or something.

293
00:19:52,045 --> 00:19:53,043
Kokkuri-san?

294
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:56,023
Kokkuri-san is the Japanese
version of the Ouija board.

295
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:57,443
Yuri was into it.

296
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:59,123
Remember?

297
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,655
The three of them would
play at the cafe sometimes.

298
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,381
The one with that coin?

299
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:08,713
Yes.

300
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:11,531
But so what does
this Kokkuri-san have

301
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,843
to do with all this?

302
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:17,923
Japanese Ouija board summons
the spirit of the fox,

303
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,793
or spirits possess people, and...
and if you're disrespectful,

304
00:20:21,795 --> 00:20:23,923
misfortune will come.

305
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,281
Bullshit!

306
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:26,868
No, he's right.

307
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,993
I've been hearing a lot of
Japanese ghost incidents

308
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:30,533
happening here in the States.

309
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:31,603
Wait, wait.

310
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,583
So you're saying that Kate is
going to be the next victim?

311
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:37,163
I'd better call her.

312
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:39,535
Joe, you don't even
know her number.

313
00:20:59,161 --> 00:20:59,909
Hey, Manager Mint.

314
00:20:59,911 --> 00:21:00,423
Joe!

315
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,303
Manager Mint!

316
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:01,803
Relax!

317
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:02,563
He can't help it.

318
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,785
Kate's the only
thing on his mind.

319
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:13,303
Manager Mint, we need to get
in touch with Kate, like now.

320
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:15,003
It's you, isn't it?

321
00:21:15,005 --> 00:21:16,493
Following Kate around?

322
00:21:16,495 --> 00:21:18,696
Are you trying to take
Kate from me as well?

323
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:20,643
No, Manager Mint, please.

324
00:21:20,645 --> 00:21:23,363
We just want to help the case.

325
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:25,665
It might the curse
of Kokkuri-san.

326
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,529
Kokkuri-san?

327
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:29,023
Haven't you heard on the news?

328
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:31,985
The Japanese [INAUDIBLE]
being reported.

329
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,193
I think Lisa Lisa and Yuri's
incidents are connected.

330
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,123
Yes, we saw them do
Kokkuri-san here,

331
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,969
and we think it may
have triggered a curse.

332
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:40,973
And if that's the case,
then Kate is in danger.

333
00:21:40,975 --> 00:21:44,673
Yes, they once told me there's
a secret spot to do that.

334
00:21:44,675 --> 00:21:46,015
Secret spot?

335
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:50,293
So we wanna inform
Kate of the curse.

336
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:52,253
So can you give us her number?

337
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:56,473
Guys, I appreciate your
concern about Kate.

338
00:21:56,475 --> 00:22:00,753
But this is real,
not your anime world.

339
00:22:00,755 --> 00:22:04,173
Besides, the extent of your
relationship with my girls

340
00:22:04,175 --> 00:22:06,153
stays in the shop!

341
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:08,143
You can't see them privately.

342
00:22:08,145 --> 00:22:09,073
So get out.

343
00:22:09,075 --> 00:22:11,516
Go, go.

344
00:22:11,518 --> 00:22:12,817
Get out.

345
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:19,493
I think she's a sadistic
feminist lesbian as well.

346
00:22:19,495 --> 00:22:22,813
Ralph, it's OK.

347
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:25,184
I think I know
where the place is.

348
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:42,649
It's Kate's car.

349
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,103
Nobby.

350
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:12,453
Nobby.

351
00:23:12,455 --> 00:23:13,713
Nobby, I can't do this!

352
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:14,673
I'm going home.

353
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:16,527
Seriously, this is too much.

354
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:17,943
I'm not even talking
about ghosts.

355
00:23:17,945 --> 00:23:19,700
We could find some
whack job here.

356
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:20,783
Ralph, it's still daytime.

357
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:22,673
Nothing is going to happen.

358
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:24,953
I seriously can't go further.

359
00:23:24,955 --> 00:23:28,393
Hey, I'm gonna check
out what's out there.

360
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:29,353
OK.

361
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:30,633
We're gonna go over there.

362
00:23:30,635 --> 00:23:31,265
OK.

363
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:32,567
OK.

364
00:23:38,915 --> 00:23:41,133
If Joe and Kate
gets closer, that

365
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:45,453
means we get a chance
with the other maids.

366
00:23:45,455 --> 00:23:47,718
He acts as if those he's hero.

367
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,128
That's what's going through
your mind right now?

368
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,563
Well, we'll finally get
to live in the real world.

369
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,655
A satisfying offline existence.

370
00:25:09,876 --> 00:25:12,393
This ain't happening.

371
00:25:12,395 --> 00:25:14,169
This ain't happening.

372
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:14,858
It's a dream.

373
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,983
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph, relax.

374
00:25:15,985 --> 00:25:16,968
Just start breathing.

375
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:18,270
Come on.

376
00:25:20,014 --> 00:25:21,428
Hey, what are you
guys doing here?

377
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,773
Get out!

378
00:25:23,775 --> 00:25:24,398
What about you?

379
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,883
Don't worry about me.

380
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:26,738
Get out... now!

381
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,863
What are you talking about?

382
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:28,358
Everything's fine.

383
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,243
Ralph's just freaking out.

384
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,723
Kate!

385
00:25:41,725 --> 00:25:43,513
I know what's going on.

386
00:25:43,515 --> 00:25:46,043
It's the curse, the
curse of the Kokkuri-san!

387
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,355
You and Yuri and
Lisa-chan did something!

388
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,770
You crossed the line somewhere!

389
00:25:51,772 --> 00:25:53,766
Son of a bitch, Kate!

390
00:25:53,768 --> 00:25:55,762
You're the one who...

391
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,758
Yuri, stop it!

392
00:26:06,242 --> 00:26:06,740
Joe.

393
00:26:06,742 --> 00:26:08,736
Joe, we have to go.

394
00:26:08,738 --> 00:26:10,536
We have to go!

395
00:26:13,728 --> 00:26:14,724
We gotta go.

396
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:16,221
We gotta go.

397
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:18,520
Joe, Joe, come on!

398
00:26:22,211 --> 00:26:25,203
Come on!

399
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:43,828
What are you gonna do?

400
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,223
Turning Yuri back.

401
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:46,453
Turn her what?

402
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:46,973
You saw her.

403
00:26:46,975 --> 00:26:48,313
She's dead.

404
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,418
Yes, she is.

405
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,319
But... but she came back.

406
00:26:51,321 --> 00:26:53,263
What?

407
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:55,813
After she was killed,
I came here every night

408
00:26:55,815 --> 00:27:00,277
to talk to her,
through Kokkuri-san.

409
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:08,063
We talked about the good
times we had together.

410
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:12,915
Sure, it was through this board,
but I knew she was right there.

411
00:27:23,431 --> 00:27:26,385
It was the third night
after she was killed.

412
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:32,495
She told me she had been
cursed and killed by Lisa Lisa.

413
00:27:41,775 --> 00:27:49,483
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san,
Kokkuri-san, [INAUDIBLE]..

414
00:27:49,485 --> 00:27:51,883
Lisa Lisa?

415
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:54,449
Hi, Kate.

416
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:55,823
You didn't come
in to work today.

417
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:57,728
Are you all right?

418
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:58,725
Yeah.

419
00:27:58,727 --> 00:28:01,153
I... I just had...

420
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:03,455
Why are you doing
Kokkuri-san alone?

421
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,850
Kate!

422
00:28:11,285 --> 00:28:13,843
Lisa-chan.

423
00:28:13,845 --> 00:28:15,603
I knew it.

424
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:17,593
You are together.

425
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,543
That's right.

426
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:23,003
Kate, I...

427
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:25,081
What's up, Lisa-chan?

428
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:30,088
I hope you guys are happy.

429
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:33,649
I knew that she
liked me as well,

430
00:28:33,651 --> 00:28:37,869
but I just wanted the
three of us to be friends.

431
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,388
No one is allowed
ever near Kate!

432
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,895
You geeks, Lisa Lisa, no one!

433
00:28:47,897 --> 00:28:48,853
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

434
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:50,566
I... I don't like Kate.

435
00:28:50,568 --> 00:28:53,021
I like you!

436
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:01,368
I'm with Kate!

437
00:29:04,705 --> 00:29:08,453
We're going to rest Yuri's
spirit, using Kokkuri-san.

438
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,393
Then Yuri will...

439
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:18,025
I know, but... but she killed
Lisa Lisa and your friends.

440
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:23,353
She's not Yuri anymore, Joe.

441
00:29:23,355 --> 00:29:25,855
She's not who she was anymore!

442
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:30,655
She's not who she was!

443
00:29:30,657 --> 00:29:31,155
I'm sorry.

444
00:29:31,157 --> 00:29:32,073
Look, I"m sorry!

445
00:29:32,075 --> 00:29:33,773
No, no!

446
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:47,142
OK, OK, OK.

447
00:29:49,793 --> 00:29:51,579
Let's do this.

448
00:30:04,635 --> 00:30:09,360
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san,
please put Yuri to rest.

449
00:30:14,288 --> 00:30:15,588
Why?

450
00:30:33,545 --> 00:30:35,990
Kate, maybe... maybe
the Kokkuri-san

451
00:30:35,992 --> 00:30:38,125
isn't the reason Yuri came back.

452
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:44,233
What, then?

453
00:30:44,235 --> 00:30:45,793
I think it was you.

454
00:30:45,795 --> 00:30:46,573
You.

455
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,663
You brought... you
brought Yuri back.

456
00:30:48,665 --> 00:30:52,427
So I think you hold the answer.

457
00:30:52,429 --> 00:30:53,729
What?

458
00:30:55,923 --> 00:30:58,220
It wasn't Kokkuri-san?

459
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,132
Oh, Yuri.

460
00:31:44,825 --> 00:31:46,623
I'm so sorry.

461
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:53,805
You said you'll always love me.

462
00:31:53,807 --> 00:31:57,673
And that's why I'm here.

463
00:31:57,675 --> 00:32:05,307
I'm always, always, always
gonna be with you, Kate.

464
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:14,502
Kokkuri-san, Kokkuri-san, will
I be together with this person?

465
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:32,148
And that's why I need to
kill everyone around you!

466
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,648
Please.

467
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:35,071
Please, don't do this.

468
00:32:35,073 --> 00:32:39,849
It's OK You and I can
always be together.

469
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:21,197
Yuri, stop it!

470
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:40,045
Yuri, stop!

471
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:47,955
Maybe You brought Yuri back,
so you hold the answer.

472
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:54,313
Yuri, we can't be
together anymore!

473
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:56,436
I'm with Joe now.

474
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:01,506
You're lying.

475
00:34:01,508 --> 00:34:02,884
You're a lesbian.

476
00:34:02,886 --> 00:34:04,185
No, I'm not.

477
00:34:11,273 --> 00:34:14,229
No!

478
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:15,708
Kate!

479
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:19,710
Stop, stop!

480
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:22,204
Stop it, Kate.

481
00:34:22,206 --> 00:34:23,506
Kate!

482
00:34:27,696 --> 00:34:29,191
Kate.

483
00:34:29,193 --> 00:34:31,187
Stop!

484
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:34,180
Stop.

485
00:34:34,182 --> 00:34:35,482
Kate.

486
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,973
You said you'll always love me.

487
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,491
Monica?

488
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:09,793
Monica!

489
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:13,981
Monica!

490
00:36:13,983 --> 00:36:15,977
Monica!

491
00:36:15,979 --> 00:36:16,975
Monica.

492
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:21,965
Monica!

493
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:24,959
Monica?

494
00:36:42,665 --> 00:36:45,523
City police suspect that
the recent gruesome murders

495
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:47,533
in the Westwood area
have connections

496
00:36:47,535 --> 00:36:49,663
to Japanese urban legends.

497
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:52,333
The police are requesting the
assistance of Japanese experts

498
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,293
on the matter.

499
00:36:53,295 --> 00:36:55,693
And it is reported that
a team of researchers

500
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:57,873
are arriving next week.

501
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,463
Recently, there
has been an influx

502
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:02,073
of reports regarding a
Japanese urban legend,

503
00:37:02,075 --> 00:37:03,283
the slit-mouth woman.

504
00:37:03,285 --> 00:37:06,033
The reports range from
sightings of the woman in person

505
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:08,283
to appearances of her in dreams.

506
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:11,418
However, the...

507
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:28,953
Claire.

508
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,345
Claire, Claire!

509
00:37:30,347 --> 00:37:31,273
Claire!

510
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:33,593
Claire, Claire, Claire!

511
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:34,138
Claire!

512
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:37,065
Did you have a dream of
the slit-mouth woman again?

513
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:44,813
Sarah, Are you...

514
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:46,193
What?

515
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:49,533
What are you saying?

516
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:54,753
In the dream, I was
the slit-mouth woman.

517
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:57,003
What are you talking about?

518
00:37:57,005 --> 00:37:58,103
It was just a dream.

519
00:37:58,105 --> 00:37:59,843
Sarah, I was the
slit-mouth woman!

520
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,567
It's just a dream!

521
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:02,853
I was... please, help me!

522
00:38:02,855 --> 00:38:03,823
Claire, Claire.

523
00:38:03,825 --> 00:38:04,323
Sarah!

524
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:07,843
You said you had never heard
of the slit-mouth woman before.

525
00:38:07,845 --> 00:38:10,213
No.

526
00:38:10,215 --> 00:38:11,515
Maybe...

527
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:15,443
Maybe what?

528
00:38:15,445 --> 00:38:16,923
No.

529
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:19,225
I have to check
something out first.

530
00:38:41,549 --> 00:38:45,848
Remy, I'm gonna ask
you just one more time.

531
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,525
Where's the shipment?

532
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:52,993
There is no shipment!

533
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,174
Everything is to set you up.

534
00:38:55,176 --> 00:38:58,941
What, you think you're
gonna get away with this?

535
00:38:58,943 --> 00:39:01,639
Where the hell's the shipment?

536
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:03,878
I want an answer!

537
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,065
No!

538
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:10,969
No, Murdoch.

539
00:39:10,971 --> 00:39:12,853
I don't think I'm
gonna get away with it.

540
00:39:13,355 --> 00:39:15,313
What the hell are
you talking about?

541
00:39:16,785 --> 00:39:19,675
You're not the boss anymore!

542
00:39:24,235 --> 00:39:27,343
Nadal, what the hell do you
think you're Doing Nadal.

543
00:39:27,345 --> 00:39:29,515
Nadal, put the gun down, Nadal!

544
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,570
Ow.

545
00:40:12,615 --> 00:40:14,855
Your time was way over.

546
00:40:18,985 --> 00:40:25,708
Shit, that hurts.

547
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,208
Jesus.

548
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:27,633
Did you have to go so hard?

549
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:29,523
Couldn't you take it
a little easier on me?

550
00:40:29,525 --> 00:40:32,455
Well, to have the
boss believe it.

551
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:33,603
Hey!

552
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:35,485
Who's the fucking boss?

553
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,002
I'm sorry.

554
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:40,345
That's right.

555
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:46,114
I'm the fucking boss.

556
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:51,905
OK, we
got a plane to catch.

557
00:41:07,407 --> 00:41:10,338
Hey, who the fuck are you?

558
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:13,768
Hey, get out of here!

559
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:18,411
Sinners full of hatred.

560
00:41:21,097 --> 00:41:23,585
Feel the wrath of hell!

561
00:41:23,587 --> 00:41:25,575
Hate.

562
00:41:25,577 --> 00:41:26,877
Hate!

563
00:42:06,911 --> 00:42:08,211
Fuck!

564
00:42:12,889 --> 00:42:14,685
Who are you?

565
00:42:18,367 --> 00:42:21,351
What the heck?

566
00:42:21,353 --> 00:42:22,653
Fix it!

567
00:43:52,225 --> 00:43:53,243
Help.

568
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:54,567
Ugh.

569
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:55,893
No, no.

570
00:43:55,895 --> 00:43:57,693
Please, I need you to stop.

571
00:43:57,695 --> 00:44:00,793
Stop pulling away from me,
and you need to stop whining.

572
00:44:00,795 --> 00:44:02,223
No, no!

573
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:04,413
This is a really
important day, OK?

574
00:44:04,415 --> 00:44:06,003
I need you stop playing games.

575
00:44:06,005 --> 00:44:07,763
You know I need to go to work.

576
00:44:07,765 --> 00:44:09,303
I don't wanna go to school.

577
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:10,623
You have to go to school.

578
00:44:10,625 --> 00:44:11,893
I need you to!

579
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:13,118
You know what?

580
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,823
I... I just have... have
had enough of you!

581
00:44:16,825 --> 00:44:18,243
Ugh.

582
00:44:18,245 --> 00:44:19,545
Oh.

583
00:45:17,055 --> 00:45:17,728
Wait, wait.

584
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,426
I don't even know
how to thank you!

585
00:45:59,715 --> 00:47:23,443
Most

586
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,253
Help!

587
00:48:52,635 --> 00:48:53,893
Thank you.

588
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:55,804
Thank you.

589
00:48:57,495 --> 00:48:58,483
No, please.

590
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:00,603
Help, please.

591
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,533
Dead bodies are coming
alive again because of him.

592
00:49:03,535 --> 00:49:06,293
He's trying to rule the world
by using people's hatred.

593
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:13,257
Please, please!

594
00:49:13,259 --> 00:49:15,015
Please, help!

595
00:49:47,365 --> 00:49:50,795
Stay out of my way, monk.

596
00:50:01,685 --> 00:50:04,300
I'm gonna give you
the death you deserve!

597
00:50:50,595 --> 00:51:45,513
This

598
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:35,049
Monica?

599
00:53:37,693 --> 00:53:39,167
Monica?

600
00:53:39,169 --> 00:53:41,619
Monica?

601
00:53:41,621 --> 00:53:42,921
Why?

602
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:49,007
No, no, no!

603
00:53:49,009 --> 00:53:51,284
Claire.

604
00:53:51,286 --> 00:53:52,585
Claire.

605
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,504
Claire.

606
00:53:55,506 --> 00:53:56,490
Claire.

607
00:53:56,492 --> 00:53:57,969
Claire.

608
00:53:57,971 --> 00:53:59,448
Claire.

609
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,427
Stay away!

610
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:00,927
Claire.

611
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:01,420
Stay away!

612
00:54:01,422 --> 00:54:01,913
Claire.

613
00:54:01,915 --> 00:54:02,413
Get out!

614
00:54:02,415 --> 00:54:03,885
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

615
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:05,857
Claire.

616
00:54:05,859 --> 00:54:07,336
Stay away from me!

617
00:54:07,338 --> 00:54:08,322
Claire, hello?

618
00:54:08,324 --> 00:54:09,093
Get out!

619
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:09,801
Slit-mouth woman!

620
00:54:09,803 --> 00:54:10,342
Relax, relax.

621
00:54:10,344 --> 00:54:12,266
It's the slit-mouth woman!

622
00:54:12,268 --> 00:54:13,252
Claire!

623
00:54:13,254 --> 00:54:15,224
Get out!

624
00:54:15,226 --> 00:54:17,196
Please, please.

625
00:54:17,198 --> 00:54:18,668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Claire.

626
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,168
Get out!

627
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:19,661
Claire.

628
00:54:19,663 --> 00:54:20,154
Claire.

629
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:20,654
Claire.

630
00:54:20,656 --> 00:54:21,313
Claire.

631
00:54:21,315 --> 00:54:21,813
Stop!

632
00:54:21,815 --> 00:54:23,958
What are you saying?

633
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,863
Give me the knife.

634
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:26,569
Look at me.

635
00:54:26,571 --> 00:54:27,069
Look at me.

636
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,471
Look me in the eyes.

637
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:33,387
Can I have the knife?

638
00:54:33,389 --> 00:54:36,289
I'm going to take
the knife away.

639
00:54:36,291 --> 00:54:36,789
Help.

640
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:37,761
The slit-mouth woman.

641
00:54:37,763 --> 00:54:40,203
Yeah, OK.

642
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:41,283
Give me the knife.

643
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:43,163
Give me the knife.

644
00:54:43,165 --> 00:54:44,573
Claire, give me the knife!

645
00:54:44,575 --> 00:54:46,371
No.

646
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,355
Claire, please.

647
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:51,849
No, Claire.

648
00:54:51,851 --> 00:54:53,841
Claire!

649
00:54:53,843 --> 00:54:56,331
Claire!

650
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:58,323
Slit-mouth woman!

651
00:54:58,325 --> 00:55:01,311
Slit-mouth woman.

652
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:04,299
Slit-mouth woman.

653
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,595
Slit-mouth woman!

654
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,467
Sarah.

655
00:56:07,547 --> 00:56:09,703
You need some help?

656
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:11,932
Oh my Buddha!

657
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:14,213
You didn't remember me!

658
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:21,783
What's going on?

659
00:56:21,785 --> 00:56:24,223
This makes no sense to me.

660
00:56:24,225 --> 00:56:25,833
I'm Ken.

661
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:28,263
What's my Buddha's name?

662
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:30,693
Uh, your Buddha's name is Jack.

663
00:56:30,695 --> 00:56:31,923
What are you, Chinese?

664
00:56:31,925 --> 00:56:32,913
I'm Mongolian.

665
00:56:32,915 --> 00:56:34,003
Mongolian?

666
00:56:34,005 --> 00:56:36,065
I think you're the
first I've met.

667
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,683
Japanese joke!

668
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,483
I'm Japanese.

669
00:56:39,485 --> 00:56:41,870
You're funny.

670
00:56:41,872 --> 00:56:42,453
Uh, all right.

671
00:56:42,455 --> 00:56:43,177
Let's see.

672
00:56:43,179 --> 00:56:45,093
Now, it shouldn't be
that difficult, actually.

673
00:56:45,095 --> 00:56:48,113
Look, you just have to
tighten this guy up here.

674
00:56:48,115 --> 00:56:49,453
They're connected.

675
00:56:49,455 --> 00:56:51,213
Just go ahead and start it up.

676
00:56:51,215 --> 00:56:53,203
Try it now.

677
00:56:53,205 --> 00:56:55,563
You really are my Buddha?

678
00:56:55,565 --> 00:56:59,345
Just basic mechanical
work I've done before.

679
00:57:07,011 --> 00:57:07,513
You see?

680
00:57:07,515 --> 00:57:08,233
Yeah.

681
00:57:08,235 --> 00:57:10,858
Wow!

682
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,848
Thank you!

683
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:13,328
Whoa, whoa, geez.

684
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:13,828
Arigato.

685
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,813
Arigato.

686
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:17,033
Hey, you know what?

687
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:19,183
Please, I want to invite
you to dinner tonight.

688
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:19,923
That's all right.

689
00:57:19,925 --> 00:57:21,083
It's not a problem, man.

690
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:22,515
Don't worry.

691
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:24,423
I don't hit on you.

692
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:27,275
I have a sister.

693
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:31,463
So the three of us, yes?

694
00:57:31,465 --> 00:57:33,378
What, for like sushi?

695
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,463
No, Japanese food
is not just sushi.

696
00:57:36,465 --> 00:57:40,243
I'll prepare more
fun, more tasty.

697
00:57:40,245 --> 00:57:42,403
And my sister?

698
00:57:42,405 --> 00:57:45,822
Very beautiful.

699
00:57:45,824 --> 00:57:47,124
Come on.

700
00:57:49,315 --> 00:57:52,233
Beautiful sister, good food.

701
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,393
OK, you don't trust me?

702
00:57:53,395 --> 00:57:56,413
It's not that I don't trust you.

703
00:57:56,415 --> 00:57:57,013
Here.

704
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,966
This is my business card.

705
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:06,133
Oh, so you import Japanese...
exotic Japanese food?

706
00:58:06,135 --> 00:58:07,313
That's interesting.

707
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:08,033
Yes.

708
00:58:08,035 --> 00:58:08,873
That's why.

709
00:58:08,875 --> 00:58:12,059
Our food is very special.

710
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:13,481
Well.

711
00:58:13,483 --> 00:58:16,179
Um, can I have
your card, please?

712
00:58:19,382 --> 00:58:21,176
Yeah, sure.

713
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:24,847
Thank you.

714
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:27,833
Oh, graphic designer?

715
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:29,263
Ah, nice.

716
00:58:29,265 --> 00:58:29,883
OK.

717
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:30,383
Follow me.

718
00:58:30,385 --> 00:58:31,803
Follow me, follow me, huh?

719
00:58:31,805 --> 00:58:33,391
Follow me, OK?

720
00:58:35,455 --> 00:58:37,505
And I have a beautiful sister.

721
00:58:39,905 --> 00:58:41,563
Hey, Ken, Ken, Ken.

722
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:42,075
You gotta...

723
00:58:42,077 --> 00:58:43,575
Oh, thank you, thank
you, thank you!

724
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:44,200
It's all right.

725
00:58:44,202 --> 00:58:45,830
Just close this.

726
00:58:45,832 --> 00:58:47,333
So I'm gonna follow you.

727
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:48,563
Yes.

728
00:58:48,565 --> 00:58:49,415
All right.

729
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,181
Sounds good.

730
00:59:29,095 --> 00:59:31,435
Umeko, Umeko?

731
00:59:34,275 --> 00:59:36,573
Sorry, she's a little shy.

732
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,883
Shy like her brother, right?

733
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:40,133
What are you talking about?

734
00:59:40,135 --> 00:59:41,153
I'm not shy.

735
00:59:41,155 --> 00:59:43,163
No, I was just making a joke.

736
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:44,093
You know.

737
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:46,633
I don't get American joke.

738
00:59:46,635 --> 00:59:49,625
Well, it wasn't an
American joke, but...

739
00:59:52,685 --> 00:59:55,463
Umeko is a shy girl.

740
00:59:55,465 --> 00:59:58,233
She's still new to this country.

741
00:59:58,235 --> 01:00:00,103
She don't have a friend.

742
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:01,073
Mhm.

743
01:00:01,075 --> 01:00:05,183
So Jack, will you
be her first friend?

744
01:00:08,135 --> 01:00:08,913
Of course.

745
01:00:08,915 --> 01:00:10,273
Yeah, why not?

746
01:00:10,275 --> 01:00:12,533
Thank you.

747
01:00:12,535 --> 01:00:16,719
Umeko experience
such a bad thing.

748
01:00:16,721 --> 01:00:20,403
An awful thing in Japan.

749
01:00:20,405 --> 01:00:22,813
So I worry about her.

750
01:00:22,815 --> 01:00:25,529
So worried.

751
01:00:25,531 --> 01:00:30,073
Uh, can I ask you
what happened to her?

752
01:00:41,955 --> 01:00:44,455
She's going to be so pretty.

753
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:55,377
Ah, Umeko!

754
01:00:55,379 --> 01:01:00,293
Again you're so pretty tonight!

755
01:01:00,295 --> 01:01:02,220
Jack, thi sis Umeko.

756
01:01:02,222 --> 01:01:05,712
Umeko, this is Jack.

757
01:01:05,714 --> 01:01:06,212
Hi.

758
01:01:06,214 --> 01:01:07,209
How you doing?

759
01:01:07,211 --> 01:01:08,511
I'm Jack.

760
01:01:16,194 --> 01:01:16,953
OK.

761
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:17,453
Hi there.

762
01:01:17,455 --> 01:01:17,803
OK.

763
01:01:17,805 --> 01:01:18,303
Come on.

764
01:01:18,305 --> 01:01:18,960
Let's eat.

765
01:01:18,962 --> 01:01:19,668
Come on, come on.

766
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:20,969
Sit down.

767
01:01:34,045 --> 01:01:34,953
Jack, let's try this.

768
01:01:34,955 --> 01:01:35,453
No, no.

769
01:01:35,455 --> 01:01:35,953
It's fine.

770
01:01:35,955 --> 01:01:36,833
Thanks.

771
01:01:36,835 --> 01:01:37,733
It's... it's inago.

772
01:01:37,735 --> 01:01:38,232
Locust.

773
01:01:38,234 --> 01:01:38,803
Yeah, OK.

774
01:01:38,805 --> 01:01:40,043
I'm... I'm good with the rice.

775
01:01:40,045 --> 01:01:40,733
Thank you.

776
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,845
It's... it's good for you.

777
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:42,803
I'm good with the rice.

778
01:01:42,805 --> 01:01:45,015
That's why I import this.

779
01:01:49,025 --> 01:01:52,228
So Ken, your... your
English is pretty good.

780
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,401
Have you been in
the States long?

781
01:01:55,403 --> 01:01:56,733
Hm.

782
01:01:56,735 --> 01:01:59,673
Yes, 20 years.

783
01:01:59,675 --> 01:02:05,703
But Umeko, she just
arrived last month.

784
01:02:05,705 --> 01:02:10,749
Do you speak any English?

785
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:20,643
Umeko is a shy girl.

786
01:02:20,645 --> 01:02:23,553
She can't speak
English yet, so Jack, I

787
01:02:23,555 --> 01:02:26,553
hope you'll be her friend.

788
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:27,153
Yeah, no.

789
01:02:27,155 --> 01:02:29,957
We're... we're all friends now.

790
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:31,259
OK?

791
01:02:40,195 --> 01:02:43,354
Umeko had a traumatic
experience in Japan.

792
01:02:43,356 --> 01:02:43,853
Yeah.

793
01:02:43,855 --> 01:02:45,943
Yeah, you were saying
something about that.

794
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:48,204
Our parents died.

795
01:02:48,206 --> 01:02:48,703
I'm sorry.

796
01:02:48,705 --> 01:02:51,013
That's... that's really sad.

797
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:52,630
It's not a sad story!

798
01:02:52,632 --> 01:02:54,063
I'm angry!

799
01:02:54,065 --> 01:02:54,798
OK.

800
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:55,603
I'm sorry.

801
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,173
I didn't mean to, like,
dishonor or anything.

802
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:02,083
Do you know word
"karoshi" means?

803
01:03:02,085 --> 01:03:03,123
"Karoshi?"

804
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:05,013
It's a Japanese word!

805
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,363
It's like "harakiri?"

806
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,923
You know, the world is trying
to using these Japanese words.

807
01:03:08,925 --> 01:03:10,873
It's like typical
Japanese things.

808
01:03:10,875 --> 01:03:13,429
OK, what does it mean?

809
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:15,423
Death by overworking!

810
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:18,193
The company killed the workers!

811
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:18,953
OK.

812
01:03:18,955 --> 01:03:22,063
Um, so why doesn't anyone
just sue the company?

813
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:25,903
The organizational system
in Japan is not working.

814
01:03:25,905 --> 01:03:26,879
Worthless.

815
01:03:26,881 --> 01:03:28,363
They don't protect individual.

816
01:03:28,365 --> 01:03:30,618
They protect the company.

817
01:03:30,620 --> 01:03:35,783
Our father worked in the
same company for 40 years.

818
01:03:35,785 --> 01:03:36,453
40!

819
01:03:36,455 --> 01:03:36,953
Yeah.

820
01:03:36,955 --> 01:03:43,433
And he died from karoshi,
exploited like a slave.

821
01:03:43,435 --> 01:03:44,583
And what happened?

822
01:03:44,585 --> 01:03:48,453
Our mother, she
cannot deal with it.

823
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:53,073
She hang herself
in front of Umeko!

824
01:03:53,075 --> 01:04:01,047
And poor Umeko, she
was under her dead body

825
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:04,143
hanging for a month!

826
01:04:04,145 --> 01:04:09,526
She just have to
watch our mother rot!

827
01:04:16,685 --> 01:04:22,183
That's why I brought
her here to America.

828
01:04:22,185 --> 01:04:23,573
I cannot leave her there.

829
01:04:23,575 --> 01:04:24,579
Yeah, no.

830
01:04:24,581 --> 01:04:27,633
It must have been really
tough on you guys.

831
01:04:27,635 --> 01:04:29,653
But you know,
you're here now so,

832
01:04:29,655 --> 01:04:33,063
you guys have a...
a new life, right?

833
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:34,365
Yeah.

834
01:04:36,976 --> 01:04:37,473
Um.

835
01:04:37,475 --> 01:04:38,053
Oh!

836
01:04:38,055 --> 01:04:38,803
Yeah.

837
01:04:38,805 --> 01:04:40,834
I remember something.

838
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:45,463
Um, there's something wrong
with Umeko's room upstairs.

839
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:47,303
The light is not working well.

840
01:04:47,305 --> 01:04:47,953
Yeah.

841
01:04:47,955 --> 01:04:51,793
So, um, is it possible
for you to fix?

842
01:04:51,795 --> 01:04:54,763
Because, you know,
you're a mechanic, right?

843
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:57,613
Please, Jack?

844
01:04:57,615 --> 01:05:01,433
It would be nice to be
two of you, you know,

845
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:05,406
to get to know each other.

846
01:05:05,408 --> 01:05:06,708
Please?

847
01:05:12,385 --> 01:05:24,480
OK, just... It was a light?

848
01:05:39,515 --> 01:05:40,815
Hello?

849
01:05:54,865 --> 01:05:57,150
Hey, hey, wait a second!

850
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:01,803
Oh man.

851
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:02,878
I'm so happy for you.

852
01:06:06,769 --> 01:06:07,267
Ow!

853
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,259
What the?

854
01:06:09,261 --> 01:06:13,243
Umeko, Umeko, Umeko!

855
01:06:13,245 --> 01:06:15,233
What are you doing,
you crazy American?

856
01:06:15,235 --> 01:06:16,535
Umeko!

857
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:09,323
Who is it?

858
01:07:11,511 --> 01:07:13,307
Who is it?

859
01:07:39,445 --> 01:07:41,150
Hey, wake the fuck up.

860
01:07:41,152 --> 01:07:41,964
Hey.

861
01:07:41,966 --> 01:07:44,204
You wanna fucking
explain this to me?

862
01:07:44,206 --> 01:07:44,703
Wake up.

863
01:07:44,705 --> 01:07:45,994
You're running a prostitution...

864
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:47,833
What are you talking about?

865
01:07:47,835 --> 01:07:48,333
This!

866
01:07:48,335 --> 01:07:51,812
What the fuck?

867
01:07:51,814 --> 01:07:53,303
Where did you get this?

868
01:07:53,305 --> 01:07:55,303
Where did I get what?

869
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:58,093
First, you tell me where
you were fucking her!

870
01:07:58,095 --> 01:07:59,783
I wasn't, Angie!

871
01:07:59,785 --> 01:08:00,283
Hah!

872
01:08:00,285 --> 01:08:00,883
Wow.

873
01:08:00,885 --> 01:08:01,382
Great.

874
01:08:01,384 --> 01:08:04,571
So you just jizzed yourself from
her blowjob and then, you know,

875
01:08:04,573 --> 01:08:06,779
stood there with your limp
fucking dick in your hand?

876
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:09,073
It was like, "oh yeah, we'll
fuck again later," huh?

877
01:08:09,075 --> 01:08:09,643
No, no.

878
01:08:09,645 --> 01:08:12,497
It wasn't anything
like that, OK?

879
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:14,473
I'm the victim in this
whole fucking this!

880
01:08:14,475 --> 01:08:15,760
Angie, she fucking jumped me!

881
01:08:15,762 --> 01:08:16,843
Oh yeah, get the fuck out.

882
01:08:16,845 --> 01:08:18,683
No, listen to me!

883
01:08:18,685 --> 01:08:19,755
Get the fuck out!

884
01:08:19,757 --> 01:08:22,293
Please, fucking listen!

885
01:08:22,295 --> 01:08:23,153
Goddamn it.

886
01:08:23,155 --> 01:08:24,323
Get out, get out!

887
01:08:24,325 --> 01:08:26,042
Angie, Angie, chill!

888
01:08:26,044 --> 01:08:27,622
Goddamn it, chill!

889
01:08:27,624 --> 01:08:29,412
You don't know the
whole damn story!

890
01:08:29,414 --> 01:08:31,183
And besides, you don't
get to kick me out

891
01:08:31,185 --> 01:08:32,563
of our own fucking house!

892
01:08:32,565 --> 01:08:33,553
Fucking impotent whore.

893
01:08:33,555 --> 01:08:36,033
Get the fuck out!

894
01:08:36,035 --> 01:08:36,788
You know, fine.

895
01:08:36,790 --> 01:08:37,650
Fuck you, Angie!

896
01:08:37,652 --> 01:08:38,233
You know what?

897
01:08:38,235 --> 01:08:39,816
It's because of your
lazy-ass blowjobs

898
01:08:39,818 --> 01:08:42,693
that we're in this whole
fucking mess in the first place.

899
01:08:42,695 --> 01:08:44,730
Fuck off, bitch!

900
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:46,032
Fuck off!

901
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:54,042
Why are you here?

902
01:08:54,044 --> 01:08:55,523
Are you following
me or something?

903
01:08:55,525 --> 01:08:57,796
Is that it?

904
01:08:57,798 --> 01:08:58,295
Hey, hey.

905
01:08:58,297 --> 01:08:58,836
Listen to me.

906
01:08:58,838 --> 01:09:00,882
Listen to me!

907
01:09:00,884 --> 01:09:01,423
Listen to me.

908
01:09:01,425 --> 01:09:03,603
Where is your
freak of a brother?

909
01:09:03,605 --> 01:09:04,133
Where is he?

910
01:09:04,135 --> 01:09:06,303
Say something!

911
01:09:06,305 --> 01:09:07,423
Hello?

912
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:08,533
Tell me where he is!

913
01:09:08,535 --> 01:09:10,043
Where is your brother?

914
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:10,542
Whoa, whoa.

915
01:09:10,544 --> 01:09:11,553
Jack, what the fuck?

916
01:09:11,555 --> 01:09:12,355
Get off of her.

917
01:09:12,357 --> 01:09:13,563
What the fuck's your problem?

918
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:13,976
Calm down.

919
01:09:13,978 --> 01:09:14,517
Angie, Angie.

920
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:15,367
This is the girl.

921
01:09:15,369 --> 01:09:15,992
It's her fault.

922
01:09:15,994 --> 01:09:16,633
I don't give a fuck.

923
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:17,935
Ow!

924
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:22,658
Umeko!

925
01:09:31,095 --> 01:09:32,554
Oh my god.

926
01:09:34,405 --> 01:09:35,283
Jesus.

927
01:09:35,285 --> 01:09:37,283
I'm sorry.

928
01:09:37,285 --> 01:09:38,752
Did you really fuck her?

929
01:09:38,754 --> 01:09:40,195
No, Christ!

930
01:09:42,105 --> 01:09:44,923
Listen.

931
01:09:44,925 --> 01:09:48,155
Angie, I'm sorry.

932
01:09:50,959 --> 01:09:53,693
Look, I really think we
should just call the police

933
01:09:53,695 --> 01:09:55,153
on these people.

934
01:09:55,155 --> 01:09:56,163
Yeah, the police?

935
01:09:56,165 --> 01:09:57,123
She's a fucking minor.

936
01:09:57,125 --> 01:09:57,403
Yes.

937
01:09:57,405 --> 01:09:58,069
Do you get that?

938
01:09:58,071 --> 01:10:01,345
You're gonna be in huge trouble.

939
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:03,337
Fuck.

940
01:10:03,339 --> 01:10:06,863
You fucking white
trash son of a bitch!

941
01:10:06,865 --> 01:10:10,543
You hit my sweet
Umeko with a rock?

942
01:10:10,545 --> 01:10:12,973
What are you talking about?

943
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:15,153
Now you're trying
to beat me up, huh?

944
01:10:15,155 --> 01:10:16,733
Are you trying to rape me?

945
01:10:16,735 --> 01:10:17,233
Huh?

946
01:10:17,235 --> 01:10:17,733
Huh?

947
01:10:17,735 --> 01:10:20,245
As you raped my sister?

948
01:10:23,066 --> 01:10:24,513
Umeko really loves you.

949
01:10:24,515 --> 01:10:26,445
Umeko really loves you!

950
01:10:26,447 --> 01:10:27,411
Stop it, stop it.

951
01:10:27,413 --> 01:10:28,613
Get off of me!

952
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:29,845
This is the guy!

953
01:10:29,847 --> 01:10:30,345
Calm down.

954
01:10:30,347 --> 01:10:30,778
Baby, calm down.

955
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,278
Calm down.

956
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:32,233
Damn it, Angie.

957
01:10:32,235 --> 01:10:33,485
This is him!

958
01:10:33,487 --> 01:10:34,958
Calm the fuck down!

959
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:35,933
Goddamn it, Angie.

960
01:10:35,935 --> 01:10:36,433
Stop it.

961
01:10:36,435 --> 01:10:42,707
I'm gonna fucking curse
you, and I'm gonna kill you!

962
01:10:56,317 --> 01:10:57,617
Fuck.

963
01:11:34,135 --> 01:11:37,793
I still don't understand how
they knew where our place was.

964
01:11:37,795 --> 01:11:38,823
Well, it's easy.

965
01:11:38,825 --> 01:11:42,313
The guy gave me his business
card, and he asked for mine.

966
01:11:42,315 --> 01:11:44,273
I was just being polite.

967
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:46,363
So I gave him mine.

968
01:11:46,365 --> 01:11:46,863
Oh.

969
01:11:46,865 --> 01:11:48,983
We can't go to the
police, so we can just

970
01:11:48,985 --> 01:11:51,495
hope they won't
do anything else.

971
01:11:54,535 --> 01:11:57,803
I just wanna know
what they want.

972
01:11:57,805 --> 01:12:01,753
Angie, these people are sick!

973
01:12:01,755 --> 01:12:04,113
I think it's very simple.

974
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:07,843
That Umeko girl
has a crush on you.

975
01:12:07,845 --> 01:12:09,963
Well, it's creepy.

976
01:12:09,965 --> 01:12:13,365
Yeah, well, you seemed to be
enjoying yourself in the photo.

977
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:54,013
What?

978
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,513
Oh my god.

979
01:12:54,515 --> 01:12:56,781
Move, move, agh!

980
01:12:59,210 --> 01:12:59,707
Oh!

981
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:01,074
What's wrong?

982
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:01,573
Oh!

983
01:13:01,575 --> 01:13:03,733
Baby, oh my god.

984
01:13:03,735 --> 01:13:05,733
Calm down.

985
01:13:05,735 --> 01:13:07,233
What's wrong with you?

986
01:13:07,235 --> 01:13:08,711
Come here.

987
01:13:08,713 --> 01:13:10,178
Whoa.

988
01:13:10,180 --> 01:13:11,645
Jesus.

989
01:13:14,092 --> 01:13:15,557
Hey, stop.

990
01:13:15,559 --> 01:13:16,535
Stop it.

991
01:13:16,537 --> 01:13:18,980
Stop it!

992
01:13:18,982 --> 01:13:20,447
Angie, Angie, Angie!

993
01:13:20,449 --> 01:13:22,403
I don't know what's happening!

994
01:13:22,405 --> 01:13:26,333
Angie, Angie!

995
01:13:52,675 --> 01:13:54,705
What did the doctor say?

996
01:13:56,485 --> 01:14:01,063
No visible injuries,
no broken bones.

997
01:14:01,065 --> 01:14:04,873
He didn't see anything, so
he couldn't say anything.

998
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:09,353
He only gave him a prescription
to help calm him down.

999
01:14:09,355 --> 01:14:12,443
No physical injuries?

1000
01:14:12,445 --> 01:14:15,439
It really could be
a Japanese curse.

1001
01:14:15,441 --> 01:14:17,625
That guy's face looked insane.

1002
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,423
Kate, you're... you're
familiar with Japan.

1003
01:14:24,425 --> 01:14:28,353
Can you help us?

1004
01:14:28,355 --> 01:14:31,313
Well, there was this one guy.

1005
01:14:31,315 --> 01:14:33,473
His name is Furen.

1006
01:14:33,475 --> 01:14:35,938
He's an onmyouji.

1007
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:36,563
You're in luck.

1008
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:39,733
He's in town.

1009
01:14:39,735 --> 01:14:42,765
An onmyouji?

1010
01:14:42,767 --> 01:14:45,523
It's like a ghost hunter.

1011
01:14:45,525 --> 01:14:48,157
I'll bring him over tomorrow.

1012
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,951
Thanks, Kate.

1013
01:15:32,299 --> 01:15:33,599
Surprise.

1014
01:15:47,845 --> 01:15:49,145
Jack.

1015
01:17:02,425 --> 01:17:05,699
He says he needs to
use a stronger force.

1016
01:17:05,701 --> 01:17:11,937
But if he does, whoever
cast the curse will die.

1017
01:17:18,383 --> 01:17:19,683
Do it.

1018
01:17:56,605 --> 01:17:59,213
He's OK now.

1019
01:17:59,215 --> 01:18:00,831
Arigato.

1020
01:18:03,503 --> 01:18:05,295
Oh, Angie.

1021
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:08,767
Angie.

1022
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:08,465
Well, nothing's happened
since, so I think you're safe.

1023
01:19:12,003 --> 01:19:14,413
I just... I still
can't believe it.

1024
01:19:14,415 --> 01:19:17,213
You know, like, I
was actually cursed.

1025
01:19:17,215 --> 01:19:20,113
No, seriously, a made
in Japan curse, Angie!

1026
01:19:20,115 --> 01:19:22,303
Yeah, well.

1027
01:19:22,305 --> 01:19:25,208
Well, you know, we... we
gotta be careful, though.

1028
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:27,743
That Umeko girl still
may be out there.

1029
01:19:27,745 --> 01:19:32,275
And Ken, he's
probably still alive.

1030
01:19:34,181 --> 01:19:36,786
You know, I think this...
this might sound crazy,

1031
01:19:36,788 --> 01:19:37,483
but I think...

1032
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:39,285
I think we should check.

1033
01:19:41,353 --> 01:19:43,263
What?

1034
01:19:43,265 --> 01:19:44,223
Yeah.

1035
01:19:44,225 --> 01:19:45,425
Seriously?

1036
01:19:45,427 --> 01:19:48,145
Yeah, we should go
to their house, and...

1037
01:19:48,147 --> 01:19:49,853
and check and see if
they're still there.

1038
01:19:49,855 --> 01:19:51,363
We have to be sure.

1039
01:19:51,365 --> 01:19:55,313
I mean, you... you remember
where it is, right?

1040
01:19:55,315 --> 01:20:00,403
He gave me his...
his business card.

1041
01:20:00,405 --> 01:20:03,513
Yeah, he's in
Torrance or something.

1042
01:20:03,515 --> 01:20:04,838
Oh yeah.

1043
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:05,338
No.

1044
01:20:05,340 --> 01:20:09,183
No, this is right
near my cousin.

1045
01:20:09,185 --> 01:20:14,617
So we'll go tomorrow, huh?

1046
01:20:14,619 --> 01:20:15,555
Yeah?

1047
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:16,963
Yeah.

1048
01:20:16,965 --> 01:20:19,125
I guess so.

1049
01:20:19,127 --> 01:20:20,523
We'll go tomorrow?

1050
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:22,404
Yeah, OK.

1051
01:20:22,406 --> 01:20:23,705
OK.

1052
01:20:25,545 --> 01:20:26,927
OK.

1053
01:20:26,929 --> 01:20:29,867
We'll... we'll go
tomorrow, Angie.

1054
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:18,193
Whoa, two times in one night?

1055
01:21:18,195 --> 01:21:19,674
Seriously?

1056
01:21:19,676 --> 01:21:21,173
I thought we had a
big day tomorrow.

1057
01:21:21,175 --> 01:21:24,508
Oh man.

1058
01:21:33,915 --> 01:21:36,883
Jack?

1059
01:21:48,815 --> 01:21:51,195
What, you want me
to follow you now?

1060
01:21:53,084 --> 01:21:54,123
You stupid fucking bitch.

1061
01:21:54,125 --> 01:21:56,575
I know where to find you!

1062
01:22:13,775 --> 01:22:15,075
Fuck!

1063
01:23:11,226 --> 01:23:12,525
Jack.

1064
01:23:17,504 --> 01:23:18,804
Jack.

1065
01:23:25,275 --> 01:23:27,453
Jack, are you here?

1066
01:24:52,807 --> 01:24:56,645
Umeko, come out!

1067
01:25:01,333 --> 01:25:02,633
Umeko!

1068
01:25:32,955 --> 01:25:35,093
Oh my god.

1069
01:25:35,095 --> 01:25:37,376
Oh my god.

1070
01:25:37,378 --> 01:25:38,677
Jack.

1071
01:25:40,605 --> 01:25:41,905
Oh.

1072
01:26:05,571 --> 01:26:08,036
No, no.

1073
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:10,997
No.

1074
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,482
No!

1075
01:26:13,484 --> 01:26:14,973
No.

1076
01:26:14,975 --> 01:26:16,464
No.

1077
01:26:16,466 --> 01:26:17,458
No.

1078
01:26:17,460 --> 01:26:18,452
No!

1079
01:26:18,454 --> 01:26:19,943
No!

1080
01:26:19,945 --> 01:26:21,434
No!

1081
01:26:21,436 --> 01:26:22,925
No!

1082
01:26:22,927 --> 01:26:24,413
No!

1083
01:26:24,415 --> 01:26:25,715
No!

1084
01:27:27,611 --> 01:27:29,483
And they're saying that
everything is somehow

1085
01:27:29,485 --> 01:27:33,423
related to the slit-mouth
woman, but it's not true.

1086
01:27:33,425 --> 01:27:35,873
There are various other
Japanese urban legends

1087
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:38,680
that are involved
with the incidents.

1088
01:27:40,875 --> 01:27:43,123
Just the other day, there
was another slit-mouth woman

1089
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:46,863
incident, but the description
is different from the rumors.

1090
01:27:46,865 --> 01:27:49,773
I saw the news.

1091
01:27:49,775 --> 01:27:52,123
It said she was Japanese.

1092
01:27:52,125 --> 01:27:54,493
Yes.

1093
01:27:54,495 --> 01:27:57,583
The name hasn't made
public yet, but it's

1094
01:27:57,585 --> 01:28:00,893
different from what your sister
and other eyewitnesses saw.

1095
01:28:00,895 --> 01:28:02,893
What do you mean?

1096
01:28:02,895 --> 01:28:05,893
When the girl,
Monica, was killed,

1097
01:28:05,895 --> 01:28:08,375
there was no
slit-mouth woman there.

1098
01:28:15,143 --> 01:28:17,033
Professor, why do
you think Claire said

1099
01:28:17,035 --> 01:28:19,853
she saw the slit-mouth woman.

1100
01:28:19,855 --> 01:28:23,333
Rumors spread, even though
no one actually sees them.

1101
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:25,073
Do you think she's lying?

1102
01:28:25,075 --> 01:28:27,293
I don't think so.

1103
01:28:27,295 --> 01:28:31,763
Ghosts, urban legends are
born from people's minds.

1104
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:33,803
So she sees it.

1105
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:42,485
Sarah, you're thinking about
the slit-mouth woman too much.

1106
01:29:16,972 --> 01:29:18,955
Sarah?

1107
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:20,257
Sarah?

1108
01:29:24,921 --> 01:29:26,221
Sarah?

1109
01:29:30,885 --> 01:29:32,185
Sarah.

1110
01:29:35,855 --> 01:29:37,155
Sarah?

1111
01:29:39,831 --> 01:29:41,131
Sarah!

1112
01:29:44,304 --> 01:29:45,604
Sarah?

1113
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:11,260
Sarah.

1114
01:30:15,550 --> 01:30:16,850
Sarah!

1115
01:30:26,235 --> 01:30:30,883
Professor, what's going on?

1116
01:30:30,885 --> 01:30:32,583
Sarah.

1117
01:30:32,585 --> 01:30:36,353
Hi, I'm Detective
Evan from the LAPD.

1118
01:30:36,355 --> 01:30:37,678
You must be Sarah.

1119
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:38,893
What?

1120
01:30:38,895 --> 01:30:40,343
Sarah.

1121
01:30:40,345 --> 01:30:42,843
We have our information.

1122
01:30:42,845 --> 01:30:46,433
The slit-mouth woman
is in this house.

1123
01:30:46,435 --> 01:30:48,373
Professor?

1124
01:30:48,375 --> 01:30:51,185
He says he just saw
it inside this house.

1125
01:30:53,845 --> 01:30:58,123
The woman is a key
witness to Monica murder.

1126
01:30:58,125 --> 01:31:02,123
And you are under
suspicion of hiding her.

1127
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:03,453
We need to search the house.

1128
01:31:03,455 --> 01:31:03,953
What?

1129
01:31:03,955 --> 01:31:04,825
Wait!

1130
01:31:04,827 --> 01:31:06,003
Hey.

1131
01:31:06,005 --> 01:31:06,563
Wait.

1132
01:31:06,565 --> 01:31:10,813
Sarah, it's my conclusion
there was no slit-mouth woman.

1133
01:31:10,815 --> 01:31:12,140
Who killed Monica was...

1134
01:31:12,142 --> 01:31:13,442
Oh, shit!

1135
01:31:31,565 --> 01:31:32,713
Sarah.

1136
01:31:32,715 --> 01:31:36,713
Sarah, tell me what's going on.

1137
01:31:36,715 --> 01:31:37,963
Sarah?

1138
01:31:37,965 --> 01:31:40,153
Is this the girl you saw?

1139
01:31:40,155 --> 01:31:43,863
Yes, but she was just
in the other room.

1140
01:31:43,865 --> 01:31:46,418
Why is she here then?

1141
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:49,940
This smell.

1142
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:57,365
You said you taped
her on camera?

1143
01:32:19,745 --> 01:32:21,045
Mhm.

1144
01:32:24,691 --> 01:32:53,883
She was... What are you doing?

1145
01:32:53,885 --> 01:32:54,606
Impossible!

1146
01:32:54,608 --> 01:32:55,908
Huh?

1147
01:32:58,425 --> 01:33:00,993
What is going on?

1148
01:33:00,995 --> 01:33:05,163
We are filming her,
but she is not here.

1149
01:33:05,165 --> 01:33:07,357
What?

1150
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:08,179
What the...

1151
01:33:08,181 --> 01:33:09,647
What's going on?

1152
01:33:11,823 --> 01:33:14,301
A ghost?

1153
01:33:14,303 --> 01:33:16,095
She's coming?

1154
01:33:18,271 --> 01:33:20,253
Sarah?

1155
01:33:20,255 --> 01:33:22,047
Where are you, Sarah?

1156
01:33:38,603 --> 01:33:39,903
Sorry.

1157
01:33:41,605 --> 01:33:44,303
I'm sorry.

1158
01:33:44,305 --> 01:33:46,463
I'm sorry.

1159
01:33:46,465 --> 01:33:49,815
Sarah, your research was...

1160
01:33:56,485 --> 01:34:00,025
Sarah, did you kill
your sister, Claire?

1161
01:34:15,409 --> 01:34:17,203
I'm sorry, Claire.

1162
01:34:19,915 --> 01:34:21,495
Sarah, stop.

1163
01:34:21,497 --> 01:34:23,419
Sarah.

1164
01:34:23,421 --> 01:34:24,862
Sarah!

1165
01:34:24,864 --> 01:34:27,748
Stop, Sarah!

1166
01:34:27,750 --> 01:34:30,134
Sarah.

1167
01:34:30,136 --> 01:34:31,436
Sarah.

1168
01:34:33,595 --> 01:34:45,733
This is Detective Evan,
requesting [INAUDIBLE]

1169
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:48,228
Claire, Claire!

1170
01:34:48,230 --> 01:34:49,225
Get out!

1171
01:34:49,227 --> 01:34:49,725
Claire.

1172
01:34:49,727 --> 01:34:50,224
Claire.

1173
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,140
There is nobody there.

1174
01:34:51,142 --> 01:34:52,220
What are you saying?

1175
01:34:52,222 --> 01:34:53,218
Stop, stop!

1176
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:55,214
What are you saying?

1177
01:34:55,216 --> 01:34:58,707
Give me the knife.

1178
01:34:58,709 --> 01:35:00,204
She was having hallucinations.

1179
01:35:00,206 --> 01:35:01,265
Claire, Claire!

1180
01:35:01,267 --> 01:35:02,723
I should have
recognized it sooner.

1181
01:35:02,725 --> 01:35:04,025
Claire.

1182
01:35:07,138 --> 01:35:09,345
Claire, calm down!

1183
01:35:14,062 --> 01:35:17,703
You bitch, can you hear me?

1184
01:35:17,705 --> 01:35:21,935
I had to kill her to save her.

1185
01:35:25,284 --> 01:35:30,813
It's all my research's fault.
I should have never pursued

1186
01:35:30,815 --> 01:35:33,553
the slit-mouth woman this much.

1187
01:35:33,555 --> 01:35:36,503
It's what I feared.

1188
01:35:36,505 --> 01:35:42,223
I think I just wanted to see
her, the slit-mouth woman.

1189
01:35:42,225 --> 01:35:47,273
That's why I went to
Japan to investigate.

1190
01:35:47,275 --> 01:35:53,627
But once you're cursed
by the slit-mouth woman,

1191
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:55,435
there's no escaping it.

1192
01:36:05,245 --> 01:36:07,923
Claire, I'm sorry.

1193
01:36:13,075 --> 01:36:14,561
Sarah?

1194
01:36:15,555 --> 01:36:17,537
Sarah?

1195
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:20,017
Sarah?

1196
01:36:20,019 --> 01:36:22,993
Sarah?

1197
01:36:22,995 --> 01:36:24,973
Sarah?

1198
01:36:24,975 --> 01:36:26,275
Sarah?

1199
01:36:56,575 --> 01:36:59,043
If you actually see
the slit-mouth woman,

1200
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:00,033
they say you die.

1201
01:37:00,035 --> 01:37:00,533
Ugh.

1202
01:37:00,535 --> 01:37:02,498
Why would you say that?

1203
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:04,183
There are ways for
not getting killed.

1204
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:04,745
How?

1205
01:37:04,747 --> 01:37:06,203
If you're asked if
she's beautiful,

1206
01:37:06,205 --> 01:37:07,973
you say she's average.

1207
01:37:07,975 --> 01:37:08,843
That's it?

1208
01:37:08,845 --> 01:37:12,213
And apparently slit-mouth
woman has two other sisters.

1209
01:37:12,215 --> 01:37:13,993
Just like our family.

1210
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,903
I thought it was
just you and Sarah.

1211
01:37:15,905 --> 01:37:18,003
No, I have another elder sister.

1212
01:37:18,005 --> 01:37:18,963
Really?

1213
01:37:18,965 --> 01:37:20,578
My dad's first wife is Japanese.

1214
01:37:20,580 --> 01:37:23,143
So you don't know anything
about your sister?

1215
01:37:23,145 --> 01:37:23,883
I mean, no.

1216
01:37:23,885 --> 01:37:26,403
They put her up for adoption
before I was even born.

1217
01:37:26,405 --> 01:37:28,520
I don't even know
what she looks like.

1218
01:37:28,522 --> 01:37:30,728
I mean, I've heard she had
taken her mother's mother,

1219
01:37:30,730 --> 01:37:33,013
so looks more Japanese
than Sarah or me.

1220
01:37:33,015 --> 01:37:34,383
She was also raised in Japan.

1221
01:37:34,385 --> 01:37:36,998
She had a Japanese name.

1222
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,788
Umeko.

1223
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:42,123
What?

1224
01:37:42,125 --> 01:37:43,863
Claire?

1225
01:37:43,865 --> 01:37:44,443
Claire?

1226
01:37:44,445 --> 01:37:45,994
Yeah, yeah, sorry.

1227
01:37:45,996 --> 01:37:48,720
I thought I saw
something over there.

1228
01:37:50,815 --> 01:37:52,253
What?

1229
01:37:52,255 --> 01:37:53,555
Claire?

1230
01:37:56,451 --> 01:37:58,298
Claire.

1231
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:12,936
Claire!

1232
01:38:32,096 --> 01:38:34,589
Monica?

1233
01:38:34,591 --> 01:38:37,582
Monica?

1234
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:38,884
Monica?

1235
01:38:43,074 --> 01:38:45,567
Monica?

1236
01:38:45,569 --> 01:38:48,062
Ugh!

1237
01:39:11,018 --> 01:39:13,011
Why do you even...

1238
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:13,511
what?

1239
01:39:13,513 --> 01:39:15,008
See something?

1240
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:17,004
Um, nothing.

1241
01:39:17,006 --> 01:39:18,804
Do you see me?

1242
01:39:21,996 --> 01:39:24,988
Erika.

1243
01:39:24,990 --> 01:39:27,395
Am I beautiful?

1244
01:39:30,074 --> 01:39:31,868
Average.

1245
