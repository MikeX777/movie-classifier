2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:24,754
I'm Marie-Carmen.

3
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,399
I'm from Toledo,

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,591
Spain.

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,715
I'm Amparito,

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,359
from Salamanca.

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,715
I'm Marie-Isabel from Segovia.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,838
I like doing housework,

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,954
ironing...

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,233
I can clean silverware,

11
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,954
but I don't enjoy it.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,679
Sure I know how to work,

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,829
I adore kids.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,069
I love them!

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,196
Little kids, little girls,

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,271
little everythings...

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,478
I make great paella,

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,359
potato and mushroom tortillas.

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,710
And croquettes, salmondigas

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,677
and Spanish omelets, gazpacho...

21
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,076
French cuisine,

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,349
I don't like.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,710
The Women on the 6th Floor

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,759
Hello.

25
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,992
What's going on?

26
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,356
I'm in a rush, got work to do!

27
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,190
It's all stopped up.

28
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,391
Thanks.

29
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,069
Germaine, I said boiled eggs
take 3 and a half minutes!

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,355
Not 10, or 5, or 4...

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,478
Don't bore me with your egg!

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,153
What's it now?

33
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,874
It's Madame...

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,917
She wants to move Madame's room!
You realize?

35
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,232
My mother died 6 months ago,
the mourning's over.

36
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,991
Not for me.

37
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,438
For me, Madame's still here.

38
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,114
Madame Suzanne hated your mother.

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,271
She was very fond of her.

40
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,510
The day after she died she said...

41
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,749
Shall I tell you?

42
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,595
Please, don't.
Let me listen to the news.

43
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,594
Hi, Mrs Triboulet.

44
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,836
Mr Joubert, it can't go on.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,479
- What is it?
- The Spaniards!

46
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,835
They partied all night again!

47
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,589
They shouted and sang!

48
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,830
I didn't sleep a wink.

49
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,709
- Tell the building manager!
- I will, Mrs. Triboulet.

50
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,632
- Bye, Madame Triboulet.
- Bye, Mr Joubert.

51
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,510
Hi, Maria!

52
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,069
Auntie! At last!

53
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,034
Such a beauty!

54
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,593
Great to see you!

55
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,470
Look,

56
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,676
hand it to me... The brown one.

57
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,712
Your bag weighs a ton.

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,679
Auntie, this is Pilar.

59
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,068
- Hi.
- Delighted.

60
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,992
We traveled together.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,673
My pal
lost a fortune in Algerian oil.

62
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,717
You're mistaken, Mr Pelletier.

63
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,713
You have Aquitaine oil

64
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,235
and you're up 100,000 francs.

65
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,196
Old francs?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,275
No, 100,000 new francs.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,634
I've lost my glasses...

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,631
Mr Pelletier, be right with you.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,313
We'll go to my office.

70
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:05,790
The stock market baffles me.
How it moves...

71
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,713
My dad said: it's just a market.

72
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,996
But it sells stocks, not veggies.

73
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,955
Come along.

74
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,998
It's a fine house.

75
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,269
Where you off to?

76
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,915
Hi, Madame Triboulet...

77
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,277
My niece, Maria. Just got here.

78
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,078
The elevator's not for you!

79
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,231
Mrs Triboulet,
we have heavy bags.

80
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,392
Elevator's for the owners.
Use the backstairs.

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,788
OK.

82
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,116
Let's go, kid.

83
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,759
''Use the backstairs!''

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,353
We'll see about that!

85
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,194
These hatboxes take up all the room!

86
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,035
- They were for Madame's hats!
- She's in the graveyard!

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,798
You're just in time !

88
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,759
- What is it?
- Germaine !

89
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,911
She won't empty your mom's room.

90
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,438
Your mom bullied me,
I couldn't change

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,114
a curtain, or a napkin ring!

92
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,077
You repapered our bedroom.

93
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,795
Now it's my home!
Germaine must understand!

94
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,071
- I'll talk to her.
- Yes, do.

95
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,315
Germaine...

96
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,153
What's going on?

97
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,038
Such ingratitude!

98
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,592
To do that
to a mother who adored you.

99
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,036
She never liked anyone,
you know that.

100
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,033
Madame Suzanne's meanness
killed her!

101
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:04,950
You're insane!

102
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,599
She murdered her!

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,794
You hear her?

104
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,476
You don't mean that.

105
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,073
Yes, I do!

106
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,673
Then get out!

107
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,909
Really, Suzanne!

108
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,474
What's with you both?

109
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,278
You're paid to obey!

110
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,352
I do! I wasted my life
for thankless people.

111
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,191
Thankless...

112
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,398
You're a bad mother.

113
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,714
I raised your kids!

114
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,792
You sent them to boarding-school!

115
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,030
Don't overdo it, Germaine!

116
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,998
I slaved years for you Jouberts.

117
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,277
Madame dies, and you fire me!

118
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,158
No, I'll quit on you!

119
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,671
So long, folks!

120
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,076
Maybe it's too old,

121
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,719
I can't make it shine.

122
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,029
I know a trick.

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,758
Use toothpaste,

124
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,912
spread it well, and rub.

125
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,671
Toothpaste!

126
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,955
Yes.

127
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,389
I had no idea...

128
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,754
It's perfect.

129
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,799
Auntie! The Frenchwoman's crying.

130
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,999
Let's go see.

131
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,515
What's wrong with her?

132
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,311
What's going on?

133
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,313
They kicked me out! ''Scram!''

134
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,150
Don't be sad.

135
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,073
We forget bosses fast.
You'll find a new family.

136
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,158
I don't want one!

137
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,199
Back in Brittany...

138
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,873
I have no one there now!

139
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,712
Maids get hired and fired.

140
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,916
Try this,

141
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,875
it's Malaga wine, warms you up.

142
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,075
Who are you?

143
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,753
She's Maria, my niece.

144
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,194
I got here today.

145
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,395
And know French?

146
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,910
From the nun's school in Burgos.

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,275
We maids must get unionized.

148
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,954
We must unite against the bosses.

149
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,031
Don't listen, she's a Communist!

150
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,992
Your praying won't help us!

151
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,871
Shut up!

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,157
I won't. Religious nuts
like you prevent change.

153
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,715
So go to Russia!

154
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,915
Enough, you two!

155
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,719
Another shot? It's not bad...

156
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,398
To Spain!

157
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,555
Hi there! It's Germaine Le Bronnec.

158
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,598
I'm going home!

159
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,832
Be of good cheer!

160
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,431
Germaine Le Bronnec!

161
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,632
Darling, I've no shirts left.
They're all dirty!

162
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,438
How'll I go to the office?

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,592
Wear a sweater!

164
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,234
A sweater?

165
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,719
Jean-Louis is going crazy.
We're like castaways!

166
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,518
Still no news from Brittany.

167
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,672
Brittany maids are over.
They're out!

168
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,752
We have Spanish maids now.
Right, Colette?

169
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,230
My Dolores is a pearl.
You even forget she's Spanish.

170
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,554
She's so clean,

171
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,438
even works on Sundays.

172
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,795
No French maid gives up her Sunday!

173
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,872
Not a chance!

174
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,590
My Dolores insists
on one thing...

175
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,792
going to Mass...

176
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,833
at 6AM.

177
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,157
If that's all...

178
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,951
A Spanish maid, why not?

179
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,314
It's simple,

180
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,114
their HQ is nearby
at the Spanish church.

181
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,111
Go there and pick one.

182
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,359
Some speak no French,
others get by.

183
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,829
Many learnt French in convents.

184
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,035
If I were you,
I'd avoid city girls...

185
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,470
Hello, miss. I'm Mr Joubert,
Madame's husband.

186
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,029
My wife spoke of you, Maria,

187
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,556
fresh from Spain
and here on a try-out?

188
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,995
If you want to stay here,

189
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,550
I'm a stickler for one thing:

190
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,719
boiled eggs.

191
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,155
I'm fussy about that,
got it from my dad.

192
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,273
An egg that's too soft or too hard
ruins my day.

193
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,669
You understand?

194
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,078
I think
you don't get what I'm saying.

195
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,638
If the egg is perfect,
my day is made.

196
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,278
In Spain,
we have superstitions, too.

197
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,235
No, it's not a superstition.

198
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,551
It's more like...
How can I put it...

199
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,759
It's not a superstition.

200
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,114
Not at all!

201
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,274
3 and a half minutes.

202
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,549
Hello.

203
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,628
Got the Figaro?

204
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,758
In the kitchen closet,

205
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,070
we store tablecloths, napkins...

206
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,309
On top, the linen,

207
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,999
as it's delicate.

208
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,196
Undersheets aren't mattress covers!

209
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:31,397
This is the Limoges china...

210
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,599
Don't confuse the plain glasses,
with the Baccarats!

211
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,151
Answer the phone, write down
the caller's name and number.

212
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:40,991
Yes, Mrs Joubert.

213
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,593
Call me ''Madame''!

214
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,758
My husband is ''Sir''.
And the kids,

215
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,512
Master Bertrand and Master Olivier.

216
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,195
They'll be home in a few weeks.
Get cracking!

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,115
Let's sum up:

218
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,748
we've dealt with laundry
and other chores.

219
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,914
The ironing is urgent:
we're way behind.

220
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,310
I left you a full list, right?

221
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,595
Yes, Madame.

222
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,437
Easy on the bleach! Or it'll stink
like a hospital! Got that?

223
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,308
- Yes, Madame.
- Fine, Maria.

224
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,635
See you later, thanks!

225
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,070
Auntie!

226
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:20,990
Open up!

227
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,036
Help me! This house is a mess!

228
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,838
No, I've got too much work.

229
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,389
It's my first day, I can't goof.

230
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,278
OK, but let me enlist

231
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,748
some others... Dolores!

232
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,751
What?

233
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,480
Maria needs help!

234
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,154
Carmen!

235
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,709
Let's go down to Maria's floor,
she needs help.

236
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:44,996
- OK!
- Teresa!

237
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,878
- What?
- Come help Maria.

238
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,837
- Now?
- We're coming, don't worry.

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,592
You about through?

240
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,636
Cut out the noise!

241
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,796
Yes, Mrs Triboulet.

242
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,791
Thanks, everyone!

243
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,315
Go down the corridor.
Help me with the dishes.

244
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,391
Auntie, the laundry!

245
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,156
She was afraid
to come out of the locker

246
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,711
She was as nervous as she could be

247
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,117
She was afraid to come
out of the locker

248
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,280
She was afraid
that someone would see...

249
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,794
Two, three, four...

250
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,996
Tell the people what she wore!

251
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,197
It was an Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie,

252
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,272
Yellow polka dot bikini

253
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,512
That she wore
for the first time today

254
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,434
Good evening, Madame.

255
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,069
You're a whiz at housework!

256
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,954
You're hired.

257
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,555
Thanks, Madame.

258
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,711
Monsieur decides your salary.

259
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,994
I had an ex-haus-ting day!

260
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,392
Run me a bath, Maria?

261
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,913
Of course, Madame.

262
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,117
Any calls or visits?

263
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,315
No, Madame.

264
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,477
Who sent me those flowers?

265
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,791
- Hello, Maria.
- Hello, sir.

266
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,553
Madame wants to hire you.

267
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,518
All work deserves a salary...

268
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:00,118
Germaine got 250 francs...

269
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,759
400 francs!

270
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,317
400?

271
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,359
You're mad!

272
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,717
250 is generous
for someone without references.

273
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:10,717
400 francs.

274
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,872
You realize how much it is?

275
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,836
400 francs.

276
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,115
You're stubborn.

277
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,158
I'm known as a tough negotiator.

278
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,709
Go to the kitchen,
I'll think it over.

279
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,436
OK, Maria,

280
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,598
you'll get 400 francs.

281
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,950
Officially, I'll pay you 250.

282
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,151
The rest, not a word to Madame.

283
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,679
See,
where there's will there's a way.

284
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,718
- See you later, Maria.
- Yes.

285
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,515
Maria,

286
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,469
when I say that, answer
''See you later, sir.''

287
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,317
If you want.

288
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,711
No, it's not what I want,
it's what's done.

289
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,870
Very well.

290
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,519
See you later, sir.

291
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,797
''See you later, sir.''

292
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,072
You got 400 francs!

293
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,476
- 400.
- Just like that.

294
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,469
Hear that, Carmen?

295
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,108
Her boss is paying her 400 francs.

296
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,316
Pretty good! You're clever.

297
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,550
I asked,
and he said yes, that's all.

298
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,793
How long
has the red mullet been here?

299
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,349
- Came today!
- No, I don't like its eyes!

300
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,109
I'll have some sardines.

301
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,316
5 kilos of potatoes!

302
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,151
What?

303
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,315
Thanks.

304
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,193
No touching!

305
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,315
Sorry.

306
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,436
Potatoes!

307
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,675
My God, it's the big day!

308
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,989
I'm so excited!

309
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,558
Very honored.
My office manager, Mr Piquer.

310
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,315
We'll be handling
Madame de Brossolette's estate.

311
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,595
Delighted.

312
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,150
Please follow me to my office.

313
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,998
I feel I know you.
Hubert spoke often of you.

314
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,277
Hubert left us too soon...

315
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,110
Indeed.

316
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,238
We'll create a portfolio of stocks

317
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,435
and bonds.

318
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,079
What do you mean bonds?

319
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,356
I despise anything binding!

320
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,993
A bond's the reverse of a stock.
A stock is a fragment of...

321
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,993
A friend tripled her portfolio
in a year!

322
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,711
Stop! If you want to speculate,
you're in the wrong place.

323
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,754
That's short term: buy today,
sell tomorrow.

324
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,070
I'm interested in the long term.

325
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,713
Me, too. I like things that last.

326
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,793
The linen stays here.
I'll deal with the screen.

327
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,475
There.

328
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,516
We'll manage.

329
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,031
You're moving the Chinese screen?

330
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,634
- It's no use in an office.
- An office?

331
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,358
This will be one.

332
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,589
I've got an office.

333
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,273
It's for me, not you.

334
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,595
For you?

335
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,832
Yes, for my correspondence,
my thoughts.

336
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,555
I want to jot down all my ideas.

337
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,708
Help Maria take all this to the 6th,
I'm bushed!

338
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,950
Here's the key, won't take a minute.

339
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,793
Come with me, Maria.

340
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,192
It's been years
since I was up there.

341
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:47,193
I know this building well:
I was born here.

342
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,794
Like my parents and grandparents.

343
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,234
The brokerage firm

344
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,073
was founded
by my grandfather in 1912.

345
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,876
I'm like a farmer who's attached
to his village steeple.

346
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,794
My father went to England once.

347
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,315
The crossing made him seasick,

348
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,636
coming back, it was worse.

349
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,756
In my family, we never travel far.

350
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,471
Summers we're at our beach house.

351
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,308
Winters,

352
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,712
the kids go skiing in the Alps
with their mom,

353
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,075
I stay in Paris.

354
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,109
I've spent my whole life
in this building.

355
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,074
I left my village when I was 16.

356
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,350
To go off and study?

357
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,671
No,
to the city to work for a family.

358
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,236
Then to work in a factory in Burgos.

359
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,789
A factory?

360
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,076
A tobacco factory.

361
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,230
We worked 15 hours a day,
slept there in a dormitory,

362
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,675
with noisy machines
running all night.

363
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,749
Here at least,
I have a room to myself.

364
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,031
May I see your room?

365
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,829
No, it's untidy.

366
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,388
Please show it to me.

367
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,590
Where's the wash basin?

368
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,793
There is none!

369
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,478
How do you wash?

370
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,914
We fill a bowl with water

371
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,310
and take it to the room.

372
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,910
Cold water?

373
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,274
Why's he here?

374
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,634
To store some things.

375
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,916
Good evening.

376
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,469
Good evening, sir.

377
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,475
I'm Dolores, Dolores Carvaillal.

378
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,279
I work for Mrs Bergeret,
a friend of your wife's.

379
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,000
Sure! My wife plays bridge with her.

380
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,478
I'm Concepcion Garcia, Maria's aunt.

381
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,830
We're delighted with her.

382
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,433
Keep an eye on her!

383
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,036
Teresa Lopez, of the 5th floor.

384
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,952
Good evening, Miss.

385
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,473
Your name, dear Madame?

386
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,239
No.

387
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,591
I'm not your dear Madame.

388
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,758
You don't care about us.

389
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,799
You came to snoop around,
then return

390
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,033
to your fine apartment.

391
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,111
Don't listen to her!

392
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,669
Let me talk.
You accept it all, I don't!

393
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,674
Come, sir, I'll show you something.

394
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,473
I see.

395
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,719
We get used to it.

396
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:29,995
It's no big deal!

397
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,556
When I need to, I go below,

398
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,392
to the toilets in the yard.

399
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,437
Me, too. Even at night.

400
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,235
Well, I'm so glad we met.

401
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,628
I'm sorry.

402
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,508
Jean-Louis!

403
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,998
Evening, ma'am.

404
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,750
I came for your toilets.

405
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,273
Plugged up, I hear.

406
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,279
That's news to me.

407
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,394
A cesspool, your husband said.

408
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,313
Please come in.

409
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,192
Good evening, Mr Boulard.

410
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,590
Thanks for coming so fast.

411
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,954
What's with our toilets?

412
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,554
I'll explain. Please come with me.

413
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,235
Where to?

414
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,038
Don't worry, come along.

415
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,309
This way, Mr Boulard.

416
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,629
Hello, sir.

417
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,872
Don't dump things in 'em!

418
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,437
No, they're just for dumping shit!

419
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,834
I'm too busy for this!

420
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,276
I said on the phone,
I'd pay you double.

421
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,271
Do your job.

422
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,549
Go on.

423
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,999
Glory be to God!

424
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,109
Hello, Mr Joubert.

425
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,076
Hello, ladies.

426
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,912
He fixed our toilets.

427
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,435
Hello, Mr Joubert!

428
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,909
Hello. And have a good day!

429
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,199
I don't know why, I'm exhausted!

430
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,550
I run around all day.

431
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,670
Soon we're off on vacation!
But sometimes that's worse.

432
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,356
Dear Maria, I really appreciate you.

433
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,075
And you're amazingly clean.

434
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,070
Thanks, Madame.

435
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,629
My husband
says you can't wash up there.

436
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,915
We do, Madame.

437
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,629
You can shower
in the boys' bathroom.

438
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,956
Thanks, Madame.

439
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,269
You're welcome.

440
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,998
I say! Antoine de Montgolfier's
getting married!

441
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,675
What time is it?

442
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,558
10 AM, Madame.

443
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,758
I'm horribly late for my dressmaker.

444
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,915
Dear Maria,

445
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,117
do you have a fiance?
You can tell me.

446
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,470
I once did love a man...

447
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,269
And you never told him!

448
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,071
Men don't know what they want.

449
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,194
By the time they ask,
you're an old maid.

450
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,876
Monsieur didn't want marriage!

451
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,390
He hesitated, wasn't sure...

452
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,076
I was a country girl,

453
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,117
I held out and he married me!

454
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,397
Once you've got a man,
never let go of him.

455
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,831
If a man doesn't want me,

456
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,194
that's his loss.

457
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,309
Really...

458
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,229
The strike is over,

459
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,517
and the Dunkerque
plant's output is up 20% .

460
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,877
Time to buy Usinor Steel.

461
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,314
Usinor, yes.

462
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,392
Mr Piquer,
where do you go on holiday?

463
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,231
To Spain.

464
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,436
I thought so.

465
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,115
Where exactly?

466
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,628
The Costa Brava.

467
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,677
But what village?

468
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,636
- Palafrugell.
- Palafrugell...

469
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,597
You've mixed with Spaniards?

470
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,869
A bit, but we French stick together.

471
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:50,950
Of course.

472
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,549
Is Palafrugell on the coast?

473
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,637
It's inland,
the sea's in the distance.

474
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,114
It's gorgeous.

475
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,635
Little streets with fountains.

476
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,638
Chatillon goes to Deauville.

477
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,836
Bettina takes him to the Casino,

478
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,150
he loses it all at the tables.

479
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,959
Still, he bought her an apartment
in Cannes.

480
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:14,996
Who?

481
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,994
Bettina de Brossolette!

482
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,834
You don't know her?

483
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,674
Men are mad for her,

484
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,272
she's the new heartthrob.

485
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,669
I said there's no mail for you!

486
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,752
- 3 weeks, no news from my sister!
- Who cares?

487
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,071
If I ever find those letters
you're in trouble!

488
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,389
What's going on here?

489
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,596
She says I swipe her mail!

490
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,517
My sister just had a baby.

491
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,592
Mrs Triboulet doesn't give us
our letters,

492
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,314
so I don't know how is the baby!

493
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,917
My sister said
she'd write every week.

494
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,873
She swore it.

495
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,355
Know what she did
to Maxime de Montbrial?

496
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,158
She grabbed his Degas,

497
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,117
and dumped him overnight!

498
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,910
Thanks, Maria. Come, Dolores.

499
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,279
We'll call her.

500
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,437
Miss,
put me through to Spain, please.

501
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,273
Name of your village?

502
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,237
- Ponte Vedra.
- Ponte Vedra, yes.

503
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,358
56 27 12.

504
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,590
Thanks a lot. You can speak now.

505
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,748
Hi, Jose, it's Dolores.

506
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,151
How's my sister?

507
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,753
She had a girl.

508
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,514
A girl!

509
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,632
How is she doing?

510
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,156
How heavy?

511
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,038
4 kilos!

512
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,757
Big kiss, and tell her to write.

513
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,831
I'll send her a gift.

514
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,514
Tell her I love her. Bye!

515
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,155
Thanks, Mr Joubert.

516
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,515
Thanks so much.

517
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,832
You're a saint. I'm so happy!

518
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,752
Thanks, Mr Jean-Louis.

519
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,999
God bless you.

520
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,515
Hi, Carmen.

521
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,319
For urgent phone calls
you can come here.

522
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,151
A phone call?

523
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,197
Like, to your family.

524
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,080
My whole family is dead.

525
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,428
I'm so sorry.

526
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,036
Heard of the Spanish civil war?

527
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,508
Sure, who hasn't?

528
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,348
My father
and my mother were murdered.

529
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,672
Franco's men slit their throats
in front of me.

530
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,355
Then,

531
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,354
they dragged the bodies
through the streets.

532
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,594
That was the Spanish civil war.

533
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,550
Good night, sir.

534
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,755
Good night.

535
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,198
They live in tiny rooms,

536
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,277
no heating or running water.

537
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,271
It was their choice.

538
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,160
They're up at 6 AM, work all day,

539
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,790
get back at 11 PM,
dead-tired and don't complain,

540
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,553
they're happy.

541
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,036
You never worry about anybody,

542
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,237
suddenly
you care about Spanish maids!

543
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,358
They live above us,
and we know nothing about them.

544
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,514
You care for those Spanish women,

545
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,352
but not about what I did!

546
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,352
Is today Wednesday?

547
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,236
At 11AM you had your feet done,

548
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,479
then to the dressmaker's,
lunch with Marie-France,

549
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,756
at 4PM to Carette's to buy cakes,

550
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,469
then off to play bridge
with Colette and Nicole.

551
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,876
Bastard!

552
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,790
I'll tell your father!

553
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,188
Who are you?

554
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,711
I'm Maria. The new maid.

555
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,432
What's all this?

556
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,674
Where's Germaine?

557
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,035
You could say hello, kids!

558
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,959
Germaine left us.

559
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,630
Sure! I bet you fired her!

560
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,394
That's vile!

561
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,074
You exploited her for 20 years,
then kick her out.

562
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,310
First, we didn't ''exploit'' her,

563
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,550
and she decided to leave.

564
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,909
And who's that one?

565
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,192
''That one'' is Maria. She's Spanish.

566
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,835
No kidding?

567
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,069
You hired a Spaniard?

568
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,475
Absolutely.

569
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,191
And be nice to her!

570
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,350
For breakfast, we want pate, salami.

571
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,397
- And pancakes.
- Right, pancakes.

572
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,598
For our snack, champagne and cakes.

573
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,038
Iron the washing by tomorrow.
Got that?

574
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,633
She didn't.

575
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,230
Pour me milk, girl.

576
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,238
Pour it yourself!

577
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,279
I know about rich brats,
they don't scare me.

578
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,716
Don't call me girl, and say please.

579
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,479
Tomorrow's Sunday, we sleep late.

580
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,952
Sunday, I go to Mass.

581
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,234
You go to Mass?

582
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,071
In a way, Germaine was our Mom.

583
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,951
We'll even miss her lousy soups!

584
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,272
She never said goodbye!

585
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,199
Gone for good!

586
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,797
And I never saw her bare-assed!

587
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,994
Let us pray.

588
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,150
Now we'll pray in silence.

589
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,279
Buy The Daily Worker!

590
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,199
The paper that fights exploiters!

591
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,559
It's a disgrace for Spain
and all Spaniards!

592
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,795
I won't force you
to become a stockbroker.

593
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,518
I'd rather die!

594
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,148
Won't follow Dad?

595
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,557
My French teacher says
only manual labor is worthy.

596
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,394
Yet he doesn't work with his hands!

597
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,118
To him, you're profiteers

598
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,753
who milk the system.

599
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,469
Your dad's no profiteer!
Who's this French teacher?

600
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:06,675
I'll tell Father Basile!

601
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,115
He says De Gaulle's a degenerate,

602
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,032
who betrayed France,
lost Algeria...

603
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,428
Absolutely!

604
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,749
A dictator, a tyrant!

605
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,798
If De Gaulle's a tyrant,
what's Franco?

606
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,674
Screw Franco!

607
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,277
What about the 100,000 executed
during the Spanish civil war?

608
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,669
I can't follow you anymore.

609
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,396
The point is, Bertrand
must take over the business.

610
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,913
I'll be a gynecologist.

611
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,554
A gynecologist?

612
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,476
That's disgusting!

613
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,918
Sticking your head
between women's legs all day?

614
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,711
Buenos dias, Maria.

615
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,514
Buenos dias, senor.

616
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,999
You want to learn Spanish?

617
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,595
I like ham... Me gusta el jamon.

618
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,029
No...

619
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,236
''jamon''.

620
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,756
With a hard ''j''.

621
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,314
- Jamon.
- With a hard ''j''.

622
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,833
With a hard ''j''.

623
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,396
No...

624
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,757
La jota...

625
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,236
Comes from here.

626
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,958
Say with me...

627
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,711
Juego.

628
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,349
El juego.

629
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,794
El joven.

630
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,756
No.

631
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,757
El jardin...

632
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,069
El jueves.

633
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,470
El jamon!

634
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,356
El jamon.

635
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,075
Very good.

636
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,837
Very good, Mr Joubert.

637
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,751
Are you happy in this house?

638
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,116
You care, sir?

639
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:21,397
Sure. I must know if you're happy.

640
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:22,676
Then, yes.

641
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,478
The most important thing
between us is trust.

642
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,228
Germaine
stayed in this house 25 years,

643
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,958
she confided in me.

644
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,156
She was almost family.

645
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:34,951
Really?

646
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,273
Where she is now?

647
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,194
I don't know.

648
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,075
And you say she was family!

649
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,279
Afternoons, she hangs out with boys
in the street,

650
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,318
but tells her husband
she visited the poor.

651
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,876
Hi, Maria.

652
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,236
- Who were you talking about?
- The bosses.

653
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:08,236
My boss comes out of the bathroom
with his robe open,

654
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,509
I mean really open.

655
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,716
So anyone can see his privates!

656
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,158
He might jump on you!

657
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,599
Very interesting. Talk to you later.

658
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,189
Hello?

659
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,949
Mrs Joubert's out!

660
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,678
Can I take a message?

661
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,395
Who is this?

662
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,194
General De Gaulle?

663
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,075
Maria, it's not General De Gaulle.

664
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,118
Don't believe all you're told
on the phone.

665
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,349
You scared me!

666
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,192
What are you doing, Maria?

667
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,389
The silverware.

668
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,913
The silverware.

669
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,631
That's real fun.

670
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,189
What product do you use?

671
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:20,911
''Gleamo.''

672
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,639
''Gleamo''...

673
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,116
Any message?

674
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,797
Tell Madame I'll meet her at home.

675
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,791
See you later, Maria!

676
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,109
Goodbye, sir.

677
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,076
To be on time we must leave now.

678
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,038
The theater is close by.

679
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,879
How long is the play?

680
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,076
- Only 2 hours.
- Very long!

681
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,637
Is this Ionesco so funny?

682
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,028
A genius, they say.

683
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,359
Madame de Brossolette dropped by
the office unannounced.

684
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,590
I said
you weren't in to get rid of her.

685
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,671
Bettina de Brossolette?

686
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,795
In person!

687
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,316
A huge portfolio,
several million francs!

688
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,872
You never said
she gave you her portfolio.

689
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,156
I didn't think it'd interest you.

690
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,068
She's a man-eater,

691
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,037
fleeces married men, ruins them.

692
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,829
She leaves me cold.

693
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,831
What's Maria up to?

694
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,638
I'll go get her.

695
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,275
What's going on?
We're due at the theater.

696
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,908
Sorry, sir. Be right there.

697
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,118
What happened to you?

698
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,430
Her husband beats her,
takes her money.

699
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,318
Let's call the police.

700
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,516
No, not the police.

701
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,990
Don't do anything, sir.
You're kind! Thanks.

702
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,754
Tonight, I'll take her in my room.
We'll manage.

703
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,955
Don't go back to your husband, OK?

704
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:05,836
They need me!

705
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,759
Sorry, sir.

706
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,639
We're off to the theater.

707
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,274
Enjoy, sir.

708
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,793
You too, Maria.

709
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,919
...losses
have been made up by gains,

710
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,389
so in spite of the downturn,

711
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,074
we're showing a positive balance.

712
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,595
I'll let Mr Joubert conclude...

713
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,548
Mr Blamond, are you the owner
of some buildings

714
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,790
on rue Raynouard?

715
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,679
Yes, on the corner of rue Colignon.

716
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,237
Could you help a friend
with a big problem?

717
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,628
With pleasure!

718
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,837
I heard
of a vacant janitor's apartment.

719
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,070
My friend Pilar'd love to get it.

720
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,639
Your friend Pilar?

721
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,075
Yes, Pilar Gonzales.

722
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,273
She must leave our building:
her husband beats her.

723
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,750
She needs somewhere to go.

724
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,876
Concepcion says a janitor's place...

725
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,597
Concepcion is Maria's aunt.

726
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,629
They came by bus from Burgos...

727
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,391
You're rarely home so early.

728
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,318
Who's in the boys' bathroom?

729
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,550
Maria. I let her take a shower.

730
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,831
- You don't mind?
- No...

731
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,476
Not now.
I'm checking Tuesday's guest list.

732
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,437
What's on next Tuesday?

733
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,114
Really! We're giving a party!

734
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,670
I'm inviting your partners,
important customers...

735
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,035
See if anyone's missing.

736
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,959
What do you mean?

737
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,038
Listen, Jean-Louis.

738
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,270
What's got into you?

739
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,113
- Remember that hotel in Italy?
- Yes.

740
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,508
On Lake Como.

741
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,477
- The Vincenzo.
- Yes, the Vincenzo.

742
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,639
It was our honeymoon.

743
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,439
That never should've ended...

744
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,429
Come along!

745
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,598
- Morning, Maria.
- Morning, Madame.

746
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,115
My husband
is bedridden this morning.

747
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,159
Slept like a baby,
but woke up with an upset stomach.

748
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,715
You called a doctor?

749
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,678
No time, I have an appointment.

750
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:12,592
You're not staying with him?

751
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,548
I'm due at a charity sale.
I can't cancel, I'd look silly.

752
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:19,595
You pamper him, Maria.

753
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:22,235
- See you later.
- See you later, Madame.

754
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:25,795
Come in.

755
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,037
Morning, sir.

756
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,634
Morning, Maria.
I feel a bit queasy.

757
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,031
Madame and I
had oysters at a brasserie.

758
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,031
An oyster can be fatal.

759
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,076
Here.

760
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,513
You have no fever.

761
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,791
I know what you need.

762
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:04,474
You sick, Mr Jean-Louis?

763
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,793
A stomach ache?

764
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,838
His liver's swollen.

765
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,468
No, it's gas. Look!

766
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,631
It's his liver, he's yellow.

767
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,075
I tell you it's gas.

768
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,719
No, it's his liver.

769
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,235
My grandpa had gas.

770
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,277
Your grandpa was a drunk!

771
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,429
We'll cure you.

772
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,039
Maria, the cure!

773
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,716
- Open your mouth!
- No, you're kind.

774
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,194
Open your mouth.

775
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,589
Feeling better?

776
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,912
Yes. Much better.
The cure worked very well.

777
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,277
Get back into bed.

778
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,874
What are you doing?

779
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,275
Nothing.

780
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,429
You want to help me?

781
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,237
Of course!

782
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:38,278
- He's a gift from heaven.
- Maria hit the jackpot!

783
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,350
Look, Teresa!

784
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,317
Hey, Brigitte Bardot,

785
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,913
take down the trash!

786
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,713
Dyed your hair blonde

787
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,917
for your soldier boy?

788
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,832
Think he'll marry you?

789
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,792
With no wig she was cuter.

790
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:55,518
You're jealous!

791
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,829
Thanks.

792
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:07,795
Here,

793
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:10,275
it's for you.

794
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,554
How old is he?

795
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,117
- I don't know.
- I mean him.

796
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,154
Your son. How old is he?

797
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:39,597
Hasn't that been done?

798
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,753
Put the rug
in my mother-in-law's room.

799
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,430
Fine. Get going!

800
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,673
Answer the door.
Tell me who it is. I'm busy.

801
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,034
Who is it, Maria?

802
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,755
Come in.

803
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,750
Hello.

804
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,035
Thanks.

805
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,669
The flowers!

806
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,195
Get a vase... Thanks.

807
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,794
Wait, don't move, don't leave.

808
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:10,236
There.

809
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,118
Thanks a lot.

810
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:13,839
- Madame Joubert?
- Who are you?

811
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,798
Rodolphe sent me. I'm Gerard.

812
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,069
Rodolphe can't come?

813
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,313
Countess de Morlaix needs him.
He said to replace him here.

814
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,318
He could have warned me!

815
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,835
Don't worry, I know my job.

816
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,117
It's a disaster, I'm way behind.

817
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,478
Go to the pantry, take over.

818
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,388
Hi, I'm Gerard.

819
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,474
Your first names?

820
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,789
I'm Maria.

821
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,234
I'm Dolores.

822
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,198
Spanish? Good, I love Spain!

823
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,638
Wanna watch me bullfight?

824
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,713
Excuse me.

825
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:07,630
Goimard!

826
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,916
- How are you?
- Just fine.

827
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:10,876
My respects.

828
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,993
Champagne, Maria?

829
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,069
Whisky?

830
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,750
When did we meet?

831
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,512
A long time ago. Too long.

832
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,229
Met him again at the club,
15 years ago. Same guy!

833
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,555
Like you.

834
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:46,598
I made him my broker in a jiffy!

835
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,830
Best to get stung by a pal!

836
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,194
You're rough.

837
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,588
Know my friend Goimard?

838
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,557
Your boarding-school pal.

839
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,516
Absolutely.

840
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,633
How's Marie-Francoise?

841
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,158
Pleased with Maria?

842
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,072
Definitely, Nicole.

843
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,312
My maid's touchy,
everything miffs her!

844
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,632
Spaniards aren't touchy,
they're proud, that's different.

845
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,189
Proud, fearless...

846
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:19,509
Fearless?

847
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,558
What's fearless
about using a floor-mop?

848
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,156
Try it, Nicole!

849
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,151
Madame de Brossolette,
delighted...

850
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:41,108
Stop calling me Madame,
it's such a bore.

851
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,033
I'm nuts about Spain.

852
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,272
Chorizo, paella, taboule.

853
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,875
- Taboule isn't Spanish!
- What?

854
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,314
Taboule isn't Spanish!

855
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,198
- Taboule's not Spanish?
- No.

856
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,591
But Flamenco is!

857
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,996
Who's that talking to Jean-Louis?

858
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,594
Bettina de Brossolette.

859
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,555
That's her?

860
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,630
Sure is.

861
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,755
Here she is...

862
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,356
Madame de Brossolette,
Suzanne, my wife.

863
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,794
Delighted.

864
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,520
Jean-Louis
invests brilliantly for me.

865
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,558
He explained it all,
but now I've forgotten!

866
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,473
Stocks, bonds...

867
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,438
I'm like you,
I find it all very complex.

868
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,192
I trust him implicitly.

869
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,669
Whatever happens, he'll protect me.

870
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,432
Yes, he's very protective.

871
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,113
- Right?
- Very.

872
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,637
I live far, in the burbs.

873
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:46,755
And you?

874
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,798
In the building.

875
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,673
On the 6th with the others?

876
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,431
Yes.

877
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,919
What room number?

878
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,354
My room's...

879
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,238
number 4.

880
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,470
4! My lucky number!

881
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,750
Maria, cut it out.

882
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,356
Don't listen to her, 4 is my room.

883
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,548
Very cute,
gave me her girlfriend's room!

884
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,117
Aren't you bored?
Alone in your little bed?

885
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,508
You about through?

886
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:16,876
Just kidding.

887
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,349
You know all men need a mommy!

888
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,318
But I don't want to generalize,

889
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,357
I've only been married 3 times!

890
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,679
Excuse me.

891
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:31,036
Listen, Maria,

892
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,395
it's for your own good.

893
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,629
I mean no harm.

894
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,359
You're needed
in the drawing-room, Gerard.

895
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,274
Certainly, sir.

896
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,235
What do you think of steel today?

897
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,472
Usinor's going up. Time to buy?

898
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,960
- Where's that guy?
- Dumping the trash.

899
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,508
Madame wants you.

900
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:23,748
You can leave now.

901
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,555
I've cleaning to do.

902
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,759
Scram! You get it?

903
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,995
I got it.

904
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,314
She's off limits!

905
00:55:58,600 --> 00:55:59,476
Hello, sir.

906
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,233
You got here so late.

907
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,349
Madame said I could this morning.

908
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,919
The apartment's a mess.

909
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,719
Because of the party.

910
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,552
Don't mention the party!

911
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,199
My work wasn't good?

912
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:14,432
You know what I mean!

913
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,592
Think you'll get away with it,
because I...

914
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,514
I warn you, next time you're out!

915
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,509
What did I do?

916
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,875
What did you do?

917
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,549
You're lucky
Madame's so fond of you.

918
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,872
- Or else...
- In fact,

919
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,549
you're just a boss like the others.

920
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:41,996
Worse than they are!

921
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,516
Go away. Get out of my sight!

922
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,719
He's for Napoleon,

923
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,871
she's a royalist.

924
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:56,554
She's Protestant, he's Catholic...

925
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:59,479
He flaunted Bettina in your house!

926
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,954
For all Paris to see!

927
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,709
Suzanne, you don't deserve that!

928
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,429
Think so?

929
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:08,754
But Bettina's one of his customers.

930
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,112
He handles her portfolio.

931
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,913
He could've warned you!

932
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:16,390
The least he could do,
considering her reputation!

933
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,990
For Jean-Louis,
I'm still a country girl.

934
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,394
What he likes are...

935
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,349
dazzling Parisian beauties.

936
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:31,635
Don't say that,
you're so delightful.

937
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,269
Anyway...

938
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,676
Have you seen my cigarettes?

939
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,155
No.

940
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:35,552
I left them here.

941
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,838
Hello, Mr Jean-Louis.

942
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,275
- You OK?
- Fine.

943
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,476
We're partying at Pilar's place.

944
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,277
Really...

945
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,589
- Join us?
- Yes, do!

946
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,749
No, thanks.

947
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:58,918
Don't argue! Come along!

948
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,920
What fun, have a drink!

949
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,315
Mr Jean-Louis!

950
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,514
Thanks for this place.

951
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,155
It's so nice. Come in.

952
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,348
Mr Jean-Louis! You're a saint,

953
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,192
you'll go to heaven.

954
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,157
You're invited to our party!

955
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,675
I can't stay.
My wife is waiting for me.

956
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,398
She can come too!

957
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,949
Madame Joubert is so elegant.

958
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,153
Can I go, Madame?

959
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,872
Yes, Maria. Have a nice time.

960
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,314
Good night, Madame.

961
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:16,513
See you tonight,
Bettina

962
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:36,830
See, she even got giant gambas!

963
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,837
He got the place for Pilar.

964
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,712
It's a great place.

965
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,518
Just what I need.

966
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,318
Ask Mr Jean-Louis to help.

967
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:57,678
Encarnacion paid 1,000 francs
to the former janitor for hers.

968
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:58,950
1,000 francs!

969
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,792
But it had a shower.

970
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:05,276
In my house in Spain,
I'll have several tubs!

971
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,710
We've heard that before!

972
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:09,518
Does that house even exist ?

973
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:10,430
Stop it.

974
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,229
Here's proof.

975
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:15,035
Isn't it?

976
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,190
Look, Mr Jean-Louis.

977
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,993
It's my husband Fernando.

978
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,197
He's building me a marble bathroom

979
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:22,918
with golden faucets.

980
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,638
I saw them in a store here.

981
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,553
I don't trust tubs,
they're dangerous.

982
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,029
In what way?

983
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:34,473
Josephina
took a bath in her boss's tub,

984
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,596
and she got pregnant.

985
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,677
I'd say...

986
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,478
Josephina...

987
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,352
did more than take a bath!

988
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,952
When I get back to Spain

989
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,829
everybody will envy me for my house.

990
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,238
And we'll be bosses.

991
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:02,355
Sure...

992
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,193
I'll never go back to Spain.

993
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,997
While that murderer rules,
I'll stay here.

994
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,030
Franco won't last forever.

995
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,354
Maria,

996
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,270
one day you should make paella
at home.

997
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:22,708
If you wish, sir.

998
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:24,670
Paella for me.

999
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,113
Good evening!

1000
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,112
This is Mr Armand.

1001
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,395
Delighted.

1002
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,278
I'm honored, ladies!

1003
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,399
I own the beauty shop near here.

1004
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:40,199
The ritzy one, where the bosses go?

1005
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,349
That very one!

1006
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:44,956
Stop by,
I'll be delighted to do your hair,

1007
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,157
for half price!

1008
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:00,030
My head's spinning!

1009
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,157
Good night, Mr Jean-Louis.

1010
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:13,949
I was wrong.

1011
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:15,873
You're not just a boss.

1012
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,229
Not in bed?

1013
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,197
No, I waited up for you.

1014
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:32,556
- You had dinner?
- Yes, thanks.

1015
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,470
You could've warned me.

1016
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,914
I'm sorry,

1017
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,874
I thought of it,
but it went by so fast!

1018
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,395
Sure... Where were you?

1019
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,198
You won't believe it.

1020
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,110
Go ahead.

1021
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,397
You know Pilar,
who works for the Dubreuils,

1022
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,549
on rue Collignon.

1023
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,915
No... I don't know Pilar.

1024
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,070
Doesn't matter.

1025
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,158
I got her a place, a stall...

1026
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,272
A stall... at the opera?

1027
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,078
No, for a janitor.

1028
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:01,550
They celebrated it
with a little party.

1029
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,631
Can't you tell the truth?

1030
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:05,836
It's true! We ate a paella!

1031
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,752
Teresa sang a copla.

1032
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,717
Was Bettina there too?

1033
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,790
Bettina?

1034
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,554
Don't deny it, she was there too!

1035
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,838
You're so wrong!
What's with this Bettina?

1036
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,116
You went to that gallery opening?

1037
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,952
What opening?

1038
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,038
Where were you?

1039
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,639
I dined with the Spanish maids.

1040
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:28,876
Don't talk nonsense!

1041
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,355
Stop it!

1042
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,269
For weeks you've had a smug smile
on your face,

1043
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:35,634
you strut around!

1044
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,030
I know when something's going on!

1045
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,115
Were you with Bettina?

1046
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,077
Yes or no?

1047
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:46,790
Yes... I was with Bettina.

1048
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,279
The humiliation...

1049
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:58,153
Let's go to bed, I'm exhausted.

1050
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,232
No, we're not going to bed.

1051
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,312
You must leave this house.

1052
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:09,271
I never want to see you again,
get out!

1053
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,349
Go away!

1054
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,999
Hello, ladies.

1055
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:16,513
The hazards of existence force me
to leave our family home

1056
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,989
for what should be a short period.

1057
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:21,191
Fate is capricious,

1058
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,999
and the female character
unpredictable.

1059
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:28,312
I hope to be a discreet and quiet
neighbor. I wish you a good day.

1060
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:29,911
Sorry.

1061
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:32,789
Have a nice day.

1062
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,479
It's a nightmare.

1063
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:38,039
- You knew it.
- No way.

1064
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:50,879
Hi, Mrs Triboulet!

1065
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,589
Please bring up the mail
to the 6th floor, room 3.

1066
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,228
Slip it under the door.

1067
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,833
Good day, Mrs Triboulet!

1068
01:06:59,080 --> 01:06:59,956
Good day.

1069
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,710
Don't make my tea, I'm going out.

1070
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,189
Listen, Monsieur has left home.

1071
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,358
I don't know where he is,

1072
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:18,873
and I don't care!

1073
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,029
Take care of his linen.

1074
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,392
When the kids are back,
he can take them out.

1075
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:25,268
He's unwelcome here.

1076
01:07:25,640 --> 01:07:26,709
Very well, Madame.

1077
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,070
We don't distrust men enough.

1078
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,439
Never forget that.

1079
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,438
I have it, Genevieve.

1080
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:40,076
I have it.

1081
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:52,670
Well?

1082
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,273
Isn't this better?

1083
01:07:57,560 --> 01:07:58,879
Hi, Carmen.

1084
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,589
Evening.

1085
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,193
Hi, Concepcion.

1086
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:07,635
Evening.

1087
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,269
- How long'll he stay here?
- Don't ask me.

1088
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,589
What do you care?

1089
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,433
I don't like having a man up here.

1090
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:17,435
He won't sneak into your room!

1091
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:20,835
Don't be so sure!

1092
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,119
- Hi, Carmen.
- Mr Jean-Louis,

1093
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:09,749
you're the owner, do as you please.

1094
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,230
But we stay in our own corner.

1095
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:14,755
But this is my home.

1096
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,070
No, bosses belong with bosses.

1097
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,319
Don't mingle with the servants.

1098
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:22,948
Sorry, Carmen. I'm staying here.

1099
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,475
Why?

1100
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,876
It's my first room of my own.

1101
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,600
First came boarding school,
then the army,

1102
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,954
then marriage.

1103
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:32,599
I really feel free now.

1104
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,556
- The 20 I owed you.
- Thanks.

1105
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:47,955
Dolores,

1106
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:51,268
where's it from?

1107
01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,432
Savings I earned
with the sweat of my brow.

1108
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,749
And you keep it here?

1109
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:57,675
Yes.

1110
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:00,273
Concepcion,

1111
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,597
what do you do with your money?

1112
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,837
I send it to my husband
for the house.

1113
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,510
And the money you don't send?

1114
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:12,230
I keep it in a shoe-box.

1115
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:14,193
Invest it!

1116
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:17,113
- ''Invest it''?
- Well-invested, it earns more!

1117
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,838
What does that mean?

1118
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:22,396
In the stock market!
It's simple, I'll explain.

1119
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,120
Don't listen.
Capitalists are bandits.

1120
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,274
Let him explain.

1121
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,668
In the market

1122
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,356
there are stocks and bonds.
What are stocks?

1123
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,592
Like when you stock up

1124
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,279
on something?

1125
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,958
In the stock market, it's different.

1126
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,032
Let's say, all 5 of you want to buy
a restaurant.

1127
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,433
Where we serve paella?

1128
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:49,836
No paella! French cuisine!

1129
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,676
You'll need capital,
let's say a million francs.

1130
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:59,472
You don't have it,
so you issue 10,000 shares.

1131
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:02,950
It's the capital people invest
in your restaurant.

1132
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,198
Handle it well, Mr Piquer!

1133
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,908
Aquitaine Oil's up 2 and a half points.

1134
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,789
I don't trust Aquitaine Oil...

1135
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,391
Look, Usinor's up.

1136
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,118
That's the one I like.

1137
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,639
Hi, Mrs Triboulet.

1138
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,677
Thanks for the mail.

1139
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:01,519
Concepcion Ramirez.

1140
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,875
Dolores Carvaillal.

1141
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:07,355
Carmen...

1142
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,794
Hi, Mrs Triboulet!

1143
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,354
Any mail for me?

1144
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:14,116
Yes, sir.

1145
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:15,793
- Thanks a lot.
- Mr Joubert again.

1146
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,315
Yes, Mr Joubert.

1147
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,799
- There.
- That's all.

1148
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,592
Have a nice day!

1149
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,835
I'll take the peonies...

1150
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:36,591
Fine.

1151
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:39,638
and the roses.
In fact, a mixed bouquet.

1152
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,915
Very good.

1153
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:42,470
There.

1154
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,269
Hello, Mrs Triboulet!

1155
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,635
Hello, Senora Joubert.

1156
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,869
Why ''Senora''?

1157
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:50,475
It's because of Mr Joubert.

1158
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,075
What about him?

1159
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,355
You don't know?

1160
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,911
He's living up on the 6th,
with the Spaniards!

1161
01:12:57,080 --> 01:12:57,830
On the 6th?

1162
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,870
It's common knowledge!
It's gone on for 2 weeks!

1163
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,429
Have a nice day, Mrs Joubert.

1164
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,758
Spanish Without Tears

1165
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:46,590
Here, Mr Jean-Louis,

1166
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,037
it's holy water
from the Virgin of Lourdes.

1167
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:51,553
You were in Lourdes?

1168
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,597
I went in the grotto,

1169
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:57,150
where St Bernadette saw the Virgin.

1170
01:13:57,640 --> 01:14:01,599
I closed my eyes,
felt her hand on my head.

1171
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,195
And she whispered into my ear.

1172
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:06,274
What did she say?

1173
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,751
''In 10 years,
you'll have a baby boy.

1174
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,512
''He'll be called Javier.''

1175
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,275
You can't give birth at 60, Dolores!

1176
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,194
The Virgin Mary performs miracles.

1177
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,315
Maybe in the Middle Ages,
but not now.

1178
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:24,549
Listen.

1179
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:27,396
Teresa has something to tell you.

1180
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,438
The finest day of my life!
Mr Armand asked me.

1181
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:31,430
What did he ask you?

1182
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,155
To marry him! I'm getting married!

1183
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,354
A miracle!

1184
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:42,835
You'll move out?

1185
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,070
Anyway, I'm through being a maid!

1186
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:47,039
To work in the beauty shop?

1187
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,553
She'll do shampoos?

1188
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,756
No, handle the cash register!

1189
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:54,909
At first, I'll stay home
and wash the blouses,

1190
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,039
then I'll iron them,

1191
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,193
and in the morning I'll mop
the floor and tidy up.

1192
01:15:05,320 --> 01:15:06,878
I'll buy your wedding gown.

1193
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:10,518
Made of white silk and lace?

1194
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,795
Whatever you want!

1195
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:19,072
This one's the best!

1196
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,508
My dad said:
''They're for special occasions.''

1197
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:25,513
I almost opened one
the day he died.

1198
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:27,393
That's not nice.

1199
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,118
Just kidding.

1200
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,795
But Teresa's marriage is one.

1201
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,473
And now I know you all...

1202
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:39,478
You think you know me,
but you don't.

1203
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:41,909
I have a son.

1204
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,079
He's 8 years old.

1205
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,153
I never married.

1206
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,718
So now you can fire me:
I made a child in sin.

1207
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,873
Not at all.

1208
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,960
You have a child, that's wonderful!

1209
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:02,951
He was adopted by a family.

1210
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,034
My mom was so ashamed of me,
I had to abandon him.

1211
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,199
The father, was a man like you.
A big owner.

1212
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:16,077
I'm not a big owner.
I live on the 6th floor.

1213
01:16:17,200 --> 01:16:19,191
You'll always be an owner.

1214
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,155
Mr Jean-Louis, thanks!

1215
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,391
It's good stuff, it's Bordeaux.

1216
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,596
Sit down.

1217
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,560
Now we'll sing. You sing along.

1218
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,711
- I don't know how!
- Give it a try.

1219
01:18:01,080 --> 01:18:02,559
He's on the 6th floor!

1220
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,517
Living in an attic room?

1221
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,953
That's how it is,
my little chickies!

1222
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:12,952
Your father is infatuated
with those Spaniards.

1223
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,029
- It's outrageous!
- A scandal!

1224
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,593
He's unworthy!

1225
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,919
It's hilarious.
I never saw it coming

1226
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,957
and I threw him out!

1227
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:25,556
My darlings, your mother's an idiot!

1228
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:27,312
We'll talk to him at once.

1229
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:28,913
Remind him of his duty.

1230
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:30,798
And of honor.

1231
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,393
That's good of you, kids.

1232
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,075
Our house is almost finished...

1233
01:18:36,510 --> 01:18:38,100
but it's taking a long time.

1234
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:41,919
Who are they?

1235
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,235
Where's our dad's room?

1236
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,311
You're Mr Jean-Louis' kids?

1237
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,515
Exactly!

1238
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:56,792
Little blond Frenchies!

1239
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,110
I'll show you. Come along.

1240
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,158
What a nice surprise! Come in!

1241
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,515
Thanks, Concepcion.

1242
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:05,954
Have a nice day.

1243
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,588
So kids, you're visiting
my little palace.

1244
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:14,469
Some chorizo? A drop of Malaga?

1245
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:17,513
- Dad, we came to ask you...
- Solemnly.

1246
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,238
To come back down.

1247
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,075
- Why?
- Because.

1248
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:22,593
This can't go on.

1249
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,398
Dad, we're very worried.

1250
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:26,357
About your inheritance?

1251
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,714
Don't make jokes!

1252
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,108
It's no place for you.

1253
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,669
For the first time
I feel in my place.

1254
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,070
Here I discovered...

1255
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,315
a family.

1256
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,152
- A family?
- Yes.

1257
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,469
But they're servants.

1258
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,074
No, they're not. They're fine women.

1259
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:47,119
I hope you find
some like them to love.

1260
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:49,038
Go, sit down.

1261
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,589
Sit down.

1262
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,476
Things OK, ladies?

1263
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:07,755
Yes, thanks.

1264
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,559
Everything fine?

1265
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,314
Very well, thanks.

1266
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:19,835
Today's the day!

1267
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,116
Aren't you ready?

1268
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,032
Hurry! We'll miss the train!

1269
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,315
It's at 9AM.

1270
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:27,391
- Where's the train?
- St Lazare Station!

1271
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:28,675
I'm ready.

1272
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:31,957
- Not coming?
- No, I have a date with Mr Armand.

1273
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,112
Where are you all going?

1274
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:38,353
To Lisieux. Once a year,
we pray on St Teresa's grave.

1275
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:40,078
More and more prayers!

1276
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:42,033
St Teresa's day is holy.

1277
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,474
- How do you go?
- By train.

1278
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,517
I'll drive you.

1279
01:20:46,680 --> 01:20:49,353
- In a car?
- I'll drive you.

1280
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:51,232
He'll take us by car!

1281
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,079
Like great ladies!

1282
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,717
Ladies,
your carriage to Lisieux is ready!

1283
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,279
Wait for me!

1284
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,873
But you're not devout!

1285
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,598
I love the countryside.

1286
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,828
Don't argue. Come long, Madame.

1287
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,150
On the 6th floor?

1288
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,912
With the Spanish maids?

1289
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:20,154
How do you cope with it?

1290
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,799
It's an outrage!

1291
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,832
Don't let him off the hook.

1292
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:27,238
Get Attorney Simon for your divorce,
he's tough.

1293
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:29,277
He did the Montalemberts'.

1294
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:31,556
He'll make Jean-Louis pay up!

1295
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,312
Bleed him to death.

1296
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,036
But maybe Jean-Louis is right.

1297
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,838
He put some joy in his life.

1298
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,470
Those women up there are alive.

1299
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,189
Down here we're dead.

1300
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,235
We need a 6th floor, too.

1301
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,992
The boss says :
''Get the gato in the kitchen!''

1302
01:21:56,160 --> 01:22:00,119
I bring back the gato,
and she screams!

1303
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,790
Really?

1304
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,155
Instead of the cake,
you got the cat!

1305
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,476
''Gateau'' is cake in French,
everybody knows that.

1306
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:09,154
So you put the cat in the fridge!

1307
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,878
No! The gato, I ate it!

1308
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,592
You ate the cat?

1309
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:00,398
- Pilar.
- Sir!

1310
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,837
- You fell asleep?
- Yes.

1311
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:04,353
I'll help you.

1312
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,393
- Maria!
- Yes?

1313
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,193
Your son...

1314
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:19,153
I know where he is.

1315
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:21,798
You know where Miguel is?

1316
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,914
His new family put him in a school,

1317
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,958
San Salvador College in Santander.

1318
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,269
In Santander?

1319
01:23:32,160 --> 01:23:33,434
You've known long?

1320
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:34,757
A long time.

1321
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:38,438
And you didn't tell me?

1322
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,875
I swore it to your mother.

1323
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,678
Why did you tell me now?

1324
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:45,992
Mr Jean-Louis loves you.

1325
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:46,951
What do you care?

1326
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:49,591
What Don Pedro did wasn't enough?

1327
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:51,114
It's not the same.

1328
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:53,110
As you wish.

1329
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:55,598
But if you go to Santander

1330
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,913
you can meet your son.

1331
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,719
Thanks, Mr Jean-Louis
for a wonderful day.

1332
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:06,710
Nice of you.

1333
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,918
I'll see if Madame needs me.

1334
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,035
Of course.

1335
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,232
- Good night, Maria.
- Good night.

1336
01:24:44,760 --> 01:24:45,670
International, please.

1337
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:48,349
In Spain,

1338
01:24:49,320 --> 01:24:50,389
the city of Santander.

1339
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:01,189
Can I speak
to the pupil Miguel Sanchez?

1340
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,918
It's his mother!

1341
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,110
They're asleep! Sure, it's late.

1342
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,029
Maria, what's going on?

1343
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:17,039
Padre, I have to hang up.
I'll call tomorrow.

1344
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,795
Thanks.

1345
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:20,389
Thanks a lot.

1346
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,510
Life's hard in Spain...
more than here.

1347
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:26,557
But I'll be with Miguel.

1348
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:29,838
Why leave so soon?

1349
01:25:30,120 --> 01:25:31,155
You have time.

1350
01:25:31,320 --> 01:25:33,880
No. I waited too long.

1351
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,713
All these years
without seeing my son.

1352
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,998
Now I know where he is.

1353
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,798
I'll miss you, Maria.

1354
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,079
I'll miss you, too.

1355
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,430
Will Jean-Louis ever come down?

1356
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:03,470
Sir.

1357
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:06,598
I wanted to tell you that...

1358
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,035
Yes, Maria.

1359
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,553
I must tell you...

1360
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:17,317
Tell me what, Maria?

1361
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,555
It's a port called Saint-Jean-de-Luz

1362
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,239
on the Basque coast,

1363
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:03,159
on the border
between France and Spain.

1364
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,310
It's the perfect place for us to go.

1365
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,437
And Madame? And the kids?

1366
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,192
Who cares? I don't.

1367
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,429
You're being silly.

1368
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:13,237
Not at all.

1369
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:18,030
It's where King Louis XIV
married the Infanta of Spain.

1370
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:23,795
- I swear! It's a historical fact!
- You're not a king,

1371
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:25,877
and I'm no Infanta!

1372
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:28,156
What'll you do all day? Tell me?

1373
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:29,912
I'll learn a new job.

1374
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:33,197
Mason, cabinetmaker, dry goods.

1375
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:36,515
You?

1376
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,351
You're no handyman!

1377
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:44,070
I'll settle my business,
next week we leave.

1378
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:46,754
We'll see.

1379
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,876
Don't say: ''We'll see''!

1380
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,871
Say: ''I promise you''.

1381
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,951
Right, I promise you.

1382
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,274
But you must promise me something,
too.

1383
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,316
Go back home.

1384
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,673
No. Not that.

1385
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:02,952
You can go down again,

1386
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:05,197
since we're both leaving.

1387
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:47,358
- Please think it over.
- I already have.

1388
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,718
Mr Blamond will take over the firm.

1389
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:54,474
And your boys?
It's a father-to-son firm.

1390
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:58,428
They're too young,
and it's a poisoned gift.

1391
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,591
It's too late, I have to leave!

1392
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:01,715
Going on a trip?

1393
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:04,075
Yes, a trip. You're right!

1394
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:07,836
A trip
that may last quite a long time.

1395
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:26,869
For me?

1396
01:29:27,800 --> 01:29:29,028
Of course.

1397
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:33,675
You know,

1398
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,116
I've thought a lot...

1399
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,590
About me, about you, about us.

1400
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,113
I've thought too.

1401
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:45,151
It's funny,
I don't see life the same way now.

1402
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,469
Like me...

1403
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:48,551
I want to start from scratch.

1404
01:29:49,560 --> 01:29:50,515
A whole new life.

1405
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,032
That's what I was saying,
as I came over.

1406
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,634
- Really?
- Yes!

1407
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,272
What are you doing?

1408
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:03,948
I want to...

1409
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:05,439
Now?

1410
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,397
Not now.

1411
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,755
Yes... That's what it's all about.

1412
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:14,356
You're right.
I wanted to tell you...

1413
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:16,916
- Talk to me later.
- What's this?

1414
01:30:17,080 --> 01:30:18,433
Mi corazon.

1415
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:19,431
Mi amor.

1416
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:22,194
Really... Maria might walk in on us!

1417
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:23,395
Maria has left.

1418
01:30:24,880 --> 01:30:25,835
She left?

1419
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:27,991
- For Spain!
- What?

1420
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:28,751
She did!

1421
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,672
- Where is she?
- On the bus.

1422
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,112
She left for Spain.

1423
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:46,396
Where to exactly? What place?

1424
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:48,079
You have her address?

1425
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:50,838
Her parents' address.

1426
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:52,753
But she won't go there.

1427
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:54,751
Did she say anything for me?

1428
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:57,309
Did she leave a note?

1429
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:58,635
She said to forget her.

1430
01:31:00,040 --> 01:31:01,234
She won't be back.

1431
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,674
She said that?

1432
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:06,951
Carmen?

1433
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,515
Is she telling the truth?

1434
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:12,351
Yes.

1435
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:13,750
It's true.

1436
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:15,509
I'm so sorry, sir.

1437
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,310
So you knew she was leaving?

1438
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,319
And never told me?

1439
01:31:27,280 --> 01:31:29,316
I thought you were my friends.

1440
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:51,473
3 years later

1441
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:29,280
Please, the Calle de las Canteras?

1442
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,192
Straight ahead.

1443
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:47,433
The leak's not fixed! You're a bum!

1444
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,318
My mother was right!

1445
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:52,830
I don't believe it!

1446
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,519
Mr Jean-Louis!

1447
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:57,839
What are you doing in Spain?

1448
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:02,710
I was nearby and said I'll go hug
my old friend Concepcion!

1449
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:05,391
So handsome! My word!

1450
01:33:05,560 --> 01:33:07,232
So there it is, your house!

1451
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,994
Yes... I'll show you around.

1452
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:11,954
A lot isn't done...

1453
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,669
If my husband worked more
and played cards less,

1454
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,034
it'd be ready now!

1455
01:33:17,200 --> 01:33:18,872
You must be Fernando?

1456
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:20,155
Yes.

1457
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,880
Delighted, Mr Jean-Louis.
How are you?

1458
01:33:23,040 --> 01:33:24,553
Just fine.

1459
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,039
Don't bother with him.

1460
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,919
Get Pilar,
tell her Mr Jean-Louis is here.

1461
01:33:29,080 --> 01:33:29,990
Pilar?

1462
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:31,989
Yes.

1463
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,833
She lives nearby, left her husband.

1464
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:36,228
6 months ago.

1465
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:39,433
Hurry! Move your butt!

1466
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,113
Stingy bum!

1467
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,398
Drives me nuts...

1468
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:46,268
He's useless!

1469
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:47,759
When I was in Paris,

1470
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,033
he cheated on me with Encarnacion,
the neighbor.

1471
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,278
I should've kicked him out,
but I didn't.

1472
01:33:54,640 --> 01:33:55,709
So it goes.

1473
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,236
In Spain, you can't divorce.

1474
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:00,994
But you need him
to finish the house!

1475
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,075
Come, I'll show you around.

1476
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,476
Isn't it great?

1477
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:15,235
A tub for a movie star!

1478
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,753
Sure it is! Look!

1479
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,069
Golden faucets!

1480
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,392
I brought them from Paris!

1481
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,153
Just for me!

1482
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:26,279
When it's done,
I'll bathe for hours.

1483
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,355
You're here, Mr Jean-Louis!

1484
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,399
How are your sons?

1485
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:43,630
One is for France,

1486
01:34:43,800 --> 01:34:45,518
the other for revolution!

1487
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:53,598
I have tea every day,
like the bosses in Paris.

1488
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,309
And Madame Suzanne?

1489
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,189
We divorced.
In France, one can do that.

1490
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:03,079
And she met a successful artist.

1491
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:04,751
And Mrs. Triboulet?

1492
01:35:05,360 --> 01:35:09,069
Now she loves Spaniards,
but hates the Portuguese.

1493
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:11,078
Poor Portuguese!

1494
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,838
Concepcion, I came to find Maria.

1495
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,198
What do you want with her?

1496
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,588
To understand.

1497
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,271
She never said goodbye.

1498
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:29,274
3 years later, it's to say goodbye?

1499
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:31,556
I know, it's absurd.

1500
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:33,439
I still think of her.

1501
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,594
I expect nothing from her,

1502
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:38,076
but I want to see her.

1503
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,470
I'd like to help you,
if I knew where she is.

1504
01:35:44,280 --> 01:35:46,589
I heard she lived nearby.

1505
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:48,557
No! She left a long time ago.

1506
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,950
Got back her son, left for Galicia.

1507
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,193
Then, no more news.

1508
01:35:56,640 --> 01:35:57,959
Well, I'll be off.

1509
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,589
Good to see you.

1510
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,195
Stay for dinner?

1511
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:03,392
No, I'm rushed. Next time.

1512
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,834
Mr Jean-Louis!

1513
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,469
I know where Maria lives.

1514
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:18,956
It's not far, 20 kilometers,

1515
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,755
in a village called Escondido.

1516
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:23,679
Escondido.

1517
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:27,799
Concepcion doesn't understand love.

1518
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:31,997
- Thanks a lot.
- Good luck.

1519
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,790
I'm looking for
Maria Gonzales' house.

1520
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,115
Hey, Miguel!

1521
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:54,638
You're Miguel?

1522
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:56,910
Yes. You're French?

1523
01:36:57,080 --> 01:36:57,796
Yes.

1524
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,993
My mom worked in Paris.

1525
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:03,115
I know.

1526
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,353
Can you take me to Maria's house?

1527
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,309
- Hey, Maria.
- How's your daughter?

1528
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:24,830
Better.

1529
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:27,516
I'll stop by later.
