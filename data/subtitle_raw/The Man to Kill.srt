THE MAN TO KILL

00:00:46,919 --> 00:00:50,015
LEGEND OF TSAR
SHCEPAN THE LITTLE

3
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:53,724
a movie by
VELJKO BULAJIC

4
00:00:56,763 --> 00:01:02,942
screenplay writers:

5
00:01:03,612 --> 00:01:38,357
cast:

6
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:47,341
Directed by:

7
00:02:47,342 --> 00:02:52,432
Since long time ago Montenegrins have
been talking about a mysterious tsar...

8
00:02:52,433 --> 00:02:58,226
Shcepan the Little, who ruled over
Montenegro since 1767 to 1773.

9
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:03,639
Even today we do not know his real name
or where he came to Montenegro from.

10
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,490
His unusual personality and destiny
inspired the imagination of the people.

11
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:23,515
Woe!
Woe to us!

12
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,328
Elfa!

13
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:41,402
Elfa...

14
00:04:58,309 --> 00:05:02,360
He must have been right about all,
since everyone was against him.

15
00:05:02,415 --> 00:05:06,274
There hasn't been a more modest or
cheap tsar since the beginning of time.

16
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:10,569
No, really. He helped everyone.
And it eventually killed him.

17
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:17,172
Ah, Shcepan, Shcepan... My leader...
Our little tsar... Rest in peace.

18
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:24,211
SHCEPAN THE LITTLE (1768-1773)
The ruler and the lord of Montenegro

19
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:19,214
ST. PETERSBURG, 2/17/1766
THE COURT OF PETER THE THIRD

20
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,155
Bravo!

21
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:31,514
Monsieur...

22
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,444
<i>Our father in Heaven,
our Lord Christ...</i>

23
00:10:03,445 --> 00:10:07,909
<i>...bless our emperor
and our tsar... </i>

24
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:14,288
..our Katarina...

25
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:16,462
...in the name of the Father,

26
00:10:16,463 --> 00:10:24,361
and the Son,
and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

27
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:28,286
Tsarina Katarina the Second!

28
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,997
Long live the tsarina!

29
00:10:35,998 --> 00:10:39,539
Long live Her Majesty!

30
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,118
Long live!
Long live!

31
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:15,550
On the double!
On the double!

32
00:11:18,515 --> 00:11:21,696
Take your guns!
Move! Move!

33
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:26,739
Montenegrins!
Captain Tanovic!

34
00:11:28,213 --> 00:11:30,410
Where are you going?

35
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:33,758
Where are you going, captain?
-Tsar Peter the Third has been killed!

36
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,989
We are going to revenge
our protector.

37
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,382
Don't be silly. You are
in danger too, Tanovic.

38
00:11:39,383 --> 00:11:43,485
This is a coup. Tsar's friends
are going to lose lives, too.

39
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:46,393
Who knows what happened to the tsar.
Therefore flee to your Montenegro,

40
00:11:46,394 --> 00:11:48,854
if I'm correct, that's the name.
-Who are you?

41
00:11:50,069 --> 00:11:52,781
Whoever he is,
he is right, captain.

42
00:11:52,782 --> 00:11:54,963
Let us get out of here.

43
00:11:57,385 --> 00:11:59,743
Come on.
Follow me!

44
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:16,618
THE HELL,
THE SAME DAY

45
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:33,701
Get up!
Get up!

46
00:12:35,008 --> 00:12:36,858
We've got mail.

47
00:12:41,557 --> 00:12:43,320
Write down,
pal...

48
00:12:43,321 --> 00:12:49,248
Incoming record number:
7643...

49
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:53,860
Top Secret. To be delivered
to supreme satan personally.

50
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:59,273
7643...  -An urgent message
from the First Order Agent.

51
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:03,938
They have killed the tsar... oh...

52
00:13:05,282 --> 00:13:08,845
Peter the Third!
-Peter the Third...

53
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:14,550
How was he killed?
-There's no how.

54
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:18,151
It says: the tsarina and the
Church have killed him.

55
00:13:18,152 --> 00:13:21,554
I must deliver this message
myself.

56
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:25,673
And you better don't fall
asleep again! Understood?

57
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:27,403
Understood, boss.

58
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,072
Boss! Ask the downstairs to
send us more coal!

59
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:35,069
I renounce... my husband...

60
00:15:26,115 --> 00:15:29,869
What?  -An urgent message
for the supreme satan.

61
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:35,854
Go away!

62
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:08,909
An urgent message from the First Order
Agent, for His Excellency.

63
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,057
Your Excellency!

64
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:52,679
Your Excellency...
-Speak.

65
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,678
Extremely urgent message
for Your Excellency.

66
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,129
The First Order Agents asks
for your instructions.

67
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,941
Katarina killed Peter the Third and
seized the throne as Katarina the Second!

68
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:08,527
Summon the Council.

69
00:17:44,873 --> 00:17:47,665
Sudden murder of Peter
the Third...

70
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:51,109
can disturb the balance
on earth...

71
00:17:51,110 --> 00:17:54,873
which forces us to make
snap decisions.

72
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,627
For...

73
00:17:56,628 --> 00:18:00,537
with Katarina's help, the Church
will strengthen its position...

74
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:05,556
among the people. It is absolutely
necessary for us to interfere...

75
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:11,171
in these events and thus
force our enemies...

76
00:18:11,172 --> 00:18:17,663
to respect the share of influence:
a half to us, and a half to them.

77
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:21,135
Therefore I declare:

78
00:18:21,136 --> 00:18:25,232
there can be no peace between
us and the clergy.

79
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:29,533
I am going to pay them back
in kind.

80
00:18:30,644 --> 00:18:33,785
And now, gentlemen,
here is the plan:

81
00:18:33,786 --> 00:18:39,322
we will deal with one allegedly
insignificant zone...

82
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:42,410
and that is...

83
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,733
Montenegro.

84
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:55,763
Peter the Third helped it and
supported its independence...

85
00:18:55,764 --> 00:19:01,234
in war against the Ottoman Empire
and Venice.

86
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:05,770
That is why he was so
popular in Montenegro.

87
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:11,150
We will send to Montenegrins
one Agent of ours...

88
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:15,874
who resembles Peter the Third
as much as possible.

89
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:21,739
Such an agent will easily be accepted
in Montenegro as a tsar.

90
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,330
And when the world finds out that the
tsar Peter the Third is still alive...

91
00:19:28,331 --> 00:19:33,324
we will be able to bring him to
Russia as the tsar...

92
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:39,173
and in that way restore the
balance again.

93
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:44,485
In order to gain complete trust
of Montegrins in his mission...

94
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:49,043
he must fight against Turkey
even more fiercely...

95
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:53,063
and you are to provide him with all
the help necessary for his mission.

96
00:19:54,148 --> 00:19:57,740
All right, yes. Perfect.
It is good for Russia either.

97
00:19:57,741 --> 00:20:02,338
Bravo! Bravo!

98
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,742
But you Russians must not forget...

99
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:07,987
that Turkey has some old
unsettled issues with Montenegro.

100
00:20:08,746 --> 00:20:11,737
This is the opportunity for us.

101
00:20:12,604 --> 00:20:15,026
We plead to grasp it.

102
00:20:15,027 --> 00:20:20,372
What is good and what is bad for our
politics in the world, Kameleck...

103
00:20:20,373 --> 00:20:25,661
can only be decided by me!
Understood?

104
00:20:29,383 --> 00:20:33,445
That... that Montenegrin
captain Tanovic...

105
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:36,935
has come back to Montenegro from
St. Petersburg, hasn't he?

106
00:20:37,688 --> 00:20:41,162
He has. The First Order Agent
said so.

107
00:20:42,349 --> 00:20:47,083
Do we have any picture of that...
that Peter the Third?

108
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:51,200
Yes. Of course we do.
In the archive.

109
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:02,590
Alexander, Nikola, Stephen...

110
00:21:04,282 --> 00:21:11,714
Shcepan... Shcepan. This will be his
name. That's a Montenegrin name.

111
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:18,216
Ingenious!
Ingenious!

112
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:22,414
Ingenious!

113
00:21:35,748 --> 00:21:39,972
You know, when the leader
starts to accept flattering...

114
00:21:39,973 --> 00:21:43,906
he makes the first step
towards his own destruction.

115
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:46,747
Is that clear?

116
00:21:46,748 --> 00:21:48,794
Clear.

117
00:21:48,795 --> 00:21:51,586
Just like your
respectful slap.

118
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:06,672
Tell the First Order Agent to move
to Montenegro at once.

119
00:22:07,963 --> 00:22:10,271
Do your missions!

120
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,749
Merchants... Healers...

121
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:22,576
Whores... Lieutenant commanders...

122
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:26,585
Kid! Bring me the
Peter the Third's file!

123
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:30,117
Your Excellency, I beg your pardon.
The tsars are up there.

124
00:22:30,118 --> 00:22:33,438
In separate archive with their
doubles.

125
00:22:37,276 --> 00:22:41,088
Your Excellency, Peter the Third
and his doubles.

126
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:54,585
To send to Montenegro the agent who
only resembles Peter the Third...

127
00:22:54,586 --> 00:23:00,748
it is a great risk.  -Yes, a risk, but
happiness makes politics, my dear.

128
00:23:00,749 --> 00:23:05,971
Yes. Satan will help him,
but it won't be easy for him.

129
00:23:10,626 --> 00:23:13,133
Perfect.

130
00:23:13,134 --> 00:23:16,380
Why is the rule of the Church
in the world so unjust?

131
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:19,669
Who knows?
Come on, who knows?

132
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:22,556
You tell me.

133
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,988
In order to rule
men and countries,

134
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:28,332
the Church preaches that
the Judgment of God exists,

135
00:23:28,333 --> 00:23:31,491
as well as the resurrection of the dead,
the transfer of souls to heaven...

136
00:23:31,492 --> 00:23:35,353
Their goal is to usurp our part
of the rule over the people.

137
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:39,048
However, it's well-known,
the Satan is equal to God...

138
00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:41,526
and they are two equal
rulers of the world.

139
00:23:42,744 --> 00:23:44,891
Very well, sit down.

140
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:48,834
Who's gonna tell me how the
Church imposes its rule over the world,

141
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:51,062
and how we?

142
00:23:51,831 --> 00:23:54,018
You tell me.

143
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:58,137
The same as we do. It decieves,
it takes part in army coups,

144
00:23:58,138 --> 00:24:01,458
uses the military force, spies
and police.

145
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,717
Go! The class is over.
Go!

146
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,876
My goat!
How beautiful you are!

147
00:24:13,877 --> 00:24:17,167
You have a noble face...
You are beautiful like a tsar!

148
00:24:17,168 --> 00:24:18,168
And you shall be a tsar!

149
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:21,368
Me?
-Peter the Third!

150
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:25,109
What?
-Yes, my goat!

151
00:24:31,151 --> 00:24:33,718
Tsar! Tsar!

152
00:24:34,698 --> 00:24:37,910
Great is the power of satan.

153
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:42,982
Great is the power of satan.
He's coming! He shall win!

154
00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:50,839
He shall win!
Great is the power of satan.

155
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,249
You've never dreamt about this!
Such an important mission!

156
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:58,328
And only because you
have a face like that!

157
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:05,866
Not face like that! But the face of
Peter the Third! Full of self-confidence,

158
00:25:05,867 --> 00:25:09,000
aristocratic, noble!
Put on the clothes, come on!

159
00:25:09,001 --> 00:25:11,049
No. I won't go.
I don't feel like going.

160
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,380
Why don't they send me to England,
France or Venice?

161
00:25:14,381 --> 00:25:17,398
I won't go to that
tiny Montenegro!

162
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:20,572
But you will be there only a year,
my cursed!

163
00:25:20,573 --> 00:25:23,091
Think of your career a bit,
think of me!

164
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:26,263
When you come back,
you'll no longer be a teacher,

165
00:25:26,264 --> 00:25:28,591
but a high official!

166
00:25:28,592 --> 00:25:31,970
Finally, it is a perfect
opportunity to make me happy.

167
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:35,373
Really?
Is this your gratitude?

168
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:38,112
If I hadn't helped you, you would
have been burnt at stake as a witch!

169
00:25:38,113 --> 00:25:41,859
I, Farfa, saved you, even married
you, although you were a slut!

170
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,861
I didn't mean to offend you,
Farfa...

171
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:48,055
I've always been happy with you.
You are so good!

172
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:50,749
And you love me,
I know, Farfa...

173
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,069
Farfa...

174
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,171
I'm going. But...

175
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:00,793
To work!
Get up!

176
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:08,409
Come on, filthy priests! To work!
Get up!

177
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,168
Quickly, quickly,
come on!

178
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:19,365
For God's sake, don't!
-How dare you call God!

179
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:23,155
This is your god,
take him! There!

180
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,824
Pull it, God's filth!
Faster! Faster!

181
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,659
Pull it, black priests!
You're not on earth any more!

182
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,775
Pull!

183
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:50,106
I would be so happy if I were
sent to the sunny Mediterranean!

184
00:26:51,398 --> 00:26:54,650
To feel the sunshine again,
to hear singing...

185
00:26:55,693 --> 00:26:58,933
and debauchery...
Debauchery...

186
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:06,898
Good.

187
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:09,950
I envy you, Farfa.
Montenegro is lovely.

188
00:27:11,816 --> 00:27:15,970
Fresh lakes,
mountains, rivers...

189
00:27:17,192 --> 00:27:20,694
And the sea... Ah, the sea...
I really envy you.

190
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:26,805
Indeed, he hadn't been in any mission
for long, right? -Since the 4th century.

191
00:27:26,806 --> 00:27:30,697
Do you remember, Zephira, how beautiful
were the orgies in the time of Rome?

192
00:27:30,698 --> 00:27:33,668
I still don't feel like going.
A year is a long time.

193
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:35,439
Farfa! Enough!

194
00:27:36,403 --> 00:27:38,138
Enough!

195
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:47,767
Third Class Agent, Farfa...

196
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:54,166
Mission: one year in Montenegro, and
then to the throne of Russia.

197
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:58,196
Quite a delicate task!
Congratulations!

198
00:27:59,392 --> 00:28:01,069
Thank you.

199
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:04,961
So...

200
00:28:06,066 --> 00:28:08,496
Absinthe, klamath weed...

201
00:28:10,115 --> 00:28:12,710
Ergot...

202
00:28:14,032 --> 00:28:15,968
Mandrake...

203
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,434
Ament...

204
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:22,153
Costmary..

205
00:28:24,608 --> 00:28:28,012
Bring the flame thrower!

206
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:32,566
Why did they choose Montenegro?

207
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:35,117
A small country with
good strategic position...

208
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:38,219
credulous people which
have strong connections with Russia.

209
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,629
and always waging war
against someone.

210
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,125
Oh, really?

211
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:47,585
Flame thrower. Try it,
that's the rule. Blow.

212
00:28:49,772 --> 00:28:51,277
No! There!

213
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:53,615
You fool.

214
00:28:54,773 --> 00:28:56,356
Stronger!

215
00:28:57,317 --> 00:29:00,088
Justine!
-Don't be afraid, everything's fine.

216
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,856
Four black candles, and the arrow of
Amor which turns to a snake.

217
00:29:19,747 --> 00:29:22,702
Try it too, that's the rule.
-No, you don't need this.

218
00:29:22,703 --> 00:29:25,369
He'll find his way without it.

219
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:27,180
Good luck!

220
00:29:27,181 --> 00:29:29,596
Come on, lift it!
Pull!

221
00:29:29,597 --> 00:29:32,119
Push, the black priests!

222
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,583
Farfa...
-To work, get up!

223
00:29:39,054 --> 00:29:43,057
Pull, the filth of God! Come on,
faster, faster! Pull!

224
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:48,486
Good luck!

225
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:51,158
Be brave!

226
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,811
Push, you filthy scumbags!
Push!

227
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:36,224
Where are you coming from,
people?

228
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:39,484
From Jad. We barely
escaped from death.

229
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:08,282
Where are you coming from, good man?
-Me, 2 children and wife, from Metohija.

230
00:32:08,283 --> 00:32:10,878
Go.  -Thank you.
God bless you.

231
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,555
Thank you.
-Deacon, write down:

232
00:32:14,556 --> 00:32:17,144
Husband, his wife and
two children from Metohija.

233
00:32:23,367 --> 00:32:26,636
I am Stanko Palikarda,
and this is my daughter Elfa.

234
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:29,364
We are escaping from Greece.
From Morea.

235
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:33,550
Good bless.

236
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,268
Thank you.
-Father, bless her.

237
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:37,944
Elfa, God bless you.

238
00:32:40,276 --> 00:32:42,142
Move on, people.

239
00:32:42,143 --> 00:32:43,880
Next!

240
00:32:44,773 --> 00:32:46,941
Don't make crowd.
Move, move.

241
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,379
Is anyone going to Cetinje?

242
00:32:55,188 --> 00:32:57,656
Hey, you?
-Me?  -Yes, you.

243
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:00,034
Come here.

244
00:33:01,732 --> 00:33:03,810
Where are you going?
-To Montenegro.

245
00:33:04,874 --> 00:33:08,527
I'm sorry, I am coming from afar.
-Come on, you don't need to apologize.

246
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:12,395
What is your name?
-Farfa... I mean, Shcepan.

247
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:15,079
I gather herbs
and heal people.

248
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,068
Healer?  -Yes.
-Come over here.

249
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:22,075
Show me your herbs.

250
00:33:24,372 --> 00:33:28,155
Costmary...
Ament...

251
00:33:30,757 --> 00:33:33,216
Absinthe for the stomachache.
-I see.

252
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:37,606
Ergot.

253
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:40,640
And what is this for?

254
00:33:42,788 --> 00:33:46,620
For abortion.  -Do you know that
it is forbidden by Church?

255
00:33:47,612 --> 00:33:49,640
Are you a Christian?

256
00:33:49,641 --> 00:33:51,808
Say "Our Father".

257
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:53,148
Say.

258
00:33:53,149 --> 00:33:55,002
Say: "Our Father who are in heaven..."

259
00:33:55,003 --> 00:33:59,146
"Who are in heaven."

260
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:04,851
"Hallowed be thy name..."
-Hallowed be... Hallowed be thy...

261
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:07,493
Who are...

262
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:09,822
Guard!

263
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:16,344
He doesn't know "Our Father".
-I don't know it either, deacon.

264
00:34:17,261 --> 00:34:19,980
Listen.

265
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,650
Come with me.

266
00:34:29,537 --> 00:34:30,973
Climb.

267
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:34,045
Take off your pants.
-But why?

268
00:34:34,046 --> 00:34:36,865
Show me your manhood,
I want to see if you are a Turk.

269
00:34:51,474 --> 00:34:54,384
Put them on.
It's all right. He's not circumcised!

270
00:34:54,385 --> 00:34:56,131
He's a Christian.

271
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,846
Go!
Go away!

272
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:24,204
Go away.

273
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,797
Go away!

274
00:35:25,798 --> 00:35:28,669
I'm on a secret mission.
Go!

275
00:35:33,216 --> 00:35:36,690
All right, you honoured me.
Now go.

276
00:35:38,447 --> 00:35:40,433
Go away.
Go.

277
00:35:43,746 --> 00:35:46,063
This healer...

278
00:35:46,064 --> 00:35:48,963
I have a bad feeling about him.

279
00:35:48,964 --> 00:35:51,436
There, there.
Go now.

280
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,355
Brothers and friends, the death of tsar
Peter the Third, God rest his soul,

281
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:08,236
brought a great calamity upon
us. Turkey and Venice...

282
00:36:08,237 --> 00:36:11,123
won't spare us.
While Peter the Third was alive...

283
00:36:11,124 --> 00:36:13,985
and helped us, sent us weapons
and protected us,

284
00:36:13,986 --> 00:36:16,614
we could resist them.

285
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:18,960
It's rumoured that
he wasn't killed.

286
00:36:18,961 --> 00:36:21,602
It's rumoured that he
wanders around the world.

287
00:36:21,603 --> 00:36:26,665
If it could only be true, Markovic!
Montenegrins would be the happiest!

288
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:32,375
Our ruler and bishop
is good and honest,

289
00:36:32,376 --> 00:36:35,224
but he's old.
He barely speaks.

290
00:36:35,225 --> 00:36:39,110
Don't say that about our ruler
Sava Petrovic.

291
00:36:40,144 --> 00:36:42,351
After all, he's still alive.

292
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:47,030
I don't mock our old bishop. I only
wonder what will happen tomorrow

293
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:51,695
with Montenegro, if that slut Katarina
goes to bed of the Turkish sultan.

294
00:36:52,947 --> 00:36:55,697
Let the bishop offer the
treasure hidden in the monastery.

295
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,520
We must buy weapons and
ammunition in Kotor, at once.

296
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,900
He cannot rule like this.

297
00:37:02,901 --> 00:37:06,380
Does he think we can defend the
country with clubs and stones!?

298
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:16,722
Let me speak,
Your Excellency.

299
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:19,045
What's the matter?

300
00:37:20,486 --> 00:37:23,908
Captain Tanovic and his men
want to depose you!

301
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:27,439
And evil as they are,
they are going to kill you!

302
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:32,629
They will.
They will.

303
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,521
They will kill,
and depose me.

304
00:37:36,415 --> 00:37:39,034
They will,
sons of satan.

305
00:37:42,254 --> 00:37:45,936
For a single night they would spent
what we were collecting for years.

306
00:38:42,686 --> 00:38:45,085
Move away, women.
Come on.

307
00:38:45,814 --> 00:38:47,140
Move away.

308
00:38:57,532 --> 00:38:58,927
Chew.

309
00:38:58,928 --> 00:39:00,639
Chew.

310
00:39:02,457 --> 00:39:03,922
Good.

311
00:39:06,082 --> 00:39:08,640
Get better.
Get better!

312
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:12,369
Good.

313
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:15,241
That's it.

314
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:31,622
You've been healed.
You've been healed!

315
00:39:31,623 --> 00:39:34,259
Healed!
Yes, you are!

316
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,389
You've been healed.
Yes.

317
00:39:43,097 --> 00:39:45,035
Healed.

318
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:51,765
Thank you...
Thank you.

319
00:40:01,956 --> 00:40:06,471
Let me kiss your hand...
-This is my cousin from Morea.

320
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:10,185
He's been born mute. Mother takes him
from one saint to another.

321
00:40:10,186 --> 00:40:11,893
Nothing can help him.

322
00:40:11,894 --> 00:40:15,699
I beg you, help
little Phillip.

323
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:42,019
Say: Shce-pan.

324
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:46,249
Shcepan.

325
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:48,568
Shcepan.

326
00:40:54,719 --> 00:41:00,969
Shce...  -God Almighty!
-Shce...  -Shcepan!

327
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,353
Shce... pan...

328
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:10,057
Miracle! This is a miracle!
-Say...

329
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:16,330
Elfa!

330
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:20,268
Elfa.

331
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:23,137
El...fa...

332
00:41:25,547 --> 00:41:29,400
My dear son...
Thank you. Thank you.

333
00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:33,604
Thank you.

334
00:41:34,762 --> 00:41:36,777
Here.

335
00:41:41,613 --> 00:41:44,686
My son!

336
00:41:56,629 --> 00:41:59,890
I have never seen
anything like this before.

337
00:42:01,664 --> 00:42:04,212
He opened the child's mouth!

338
00:42:04,213 --> 00:42:07,807
The Lord my God...
Is that him?

339
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:11,056
Is that tsar Peter the Third?

340
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:17,005
Might be.

341
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:36,853
Stranger, who are you?  -I heal sick
people, and it doesn't matter who I am.

342
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:41,050
Who are you?  -Me? Bishop and
the ruler of Montenegro.

343
00:42:43,217 --> 00:42:46,939
You? Really?

344
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,882
Differently I imagined the bishop
and the ruler of this militant people.

345
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,451
I am disappointed.

346
00:42:56,918 --> 00:43:01,681
People without a ruler is like a flock
without a male goat, without a shepherd

347
00:43:04,075 --> 00:43:07,836
And you are indeed the
ruler of Montenegro?

348
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,787
I anathemize you, you scum!
Disappear, you filthy pagan!

349
00:43:13,788 --> 00:43:15,547
Disappear!

350
00:43:24,391 --> 00:43:28,504
Go away, the son of the devil!
Go away!

351
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:44,670
The Church always sees devil
where there isn't one!

352
00:43:44,671 --> 00:43:47,526
He said it well.
-Go away!

353
00:43:52,374 --> 00:43:55,042
Welcome.
-You are good, son, very good.

354
00:43:57,281 --> 00:44:00,653
He said it well.  -Welcome.
-Miracle worker!

355
00:44:38,224 --> 00:44:43,573
Sir! Sir, if you would deign to
accept my hospitality...

356
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:46,578
It would be a great
honour for me.

357
00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:49,896
Especially after such a long trip,
right?

358
00:44:50,676 --> 00:44:55,969
I owe you my respect.
Indeed, a person who...

359
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:01,249
you resemble... I am happy,
and I offer you my humble abode.

360
00:45:01,995 --> 00:45:04,757
Where is your house?
-Over there.

361
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:10,609
Great are the works of God, my lord,
my tsar!

362
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:15,727
I am captain Marko Tanovic.
Don't you remember me?

363
00:45:16,994 --> 00:45:23,495
My dear cap. Tanovic, obvioulsy I can
count on you as you can count on me.

364
00:45:23,496 --> 00:45:25,083
That's enough, my lord.

365
00:45:25,084 --> 00:45:28,958
Don't say anything else, my tsar. Your
presence here speaks for you.

366
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:33,434
I respect your incognito.
You've always helped Montenegro.

367
00:45:33,435 --> 00:45:38,358
I want to say that I know
why you are here.

368
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:40,454
Let us go to my home.

369
00:45:41,451 --> 00:45:43,498
This way.

370
00:45:43,499 --> 00:45:47,238
You came at the right moment.  -That's
why I took this long trip.

371
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:55,440
Prepare a room for our
guest, quickly!

372
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:51,208
Good evening.

373
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:53,919
What's the matter?
Why are you calling me?

374
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,177
Everything's fine.
Captain Tanovic believed.

375
00:47:59,151 --> 00:48:03,305
The mission has successfully started.
-Don't work only with capt. Tanovic.

376
00:48:03,306 --> 00:48:09,817
Turn to the people. You must now act
and think like a real politician, clear?

377
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:16,445
Learn this speech. Immediately start to
perform. This is extremely urgent.

378
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,517
Forgive me.

379
00:48:20,518 --> 00:48:24,461
I thought...
-You thought what?

380
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:29,713
Call me when you are in trouble. Be
independent. You act like a fool.

381
00:49:24,058 --> 00:49:27,335
I came to you because I see
many conflicts.

382
00:49:27,336 --> 00:49:31,762
I am neither afraid of
the smell of incense...

383
00:49:34,031 --> 00:49:39,519
Two quinces are not ripe yet.
I am following a great wisdom...

384
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,920
Do not try to uncover this
great secret of my identity.

385
00:49:47,213 --> 00:49:50,034
Fresh fish, people!

386
00:49:51,831 --> 00:49:56,066
I don't use incense.
This herb is for the eyes.

387
00:49:56,598 --> 00:50:00,130
I help when neither the Church
nor God can help.

388
00:50:00,131 --> 00:50:04,192
I don't pour out empty words.
Come closer, woman, take this.

389
00:50:05,209 --> 00:50:07,135
Take.

390
00:50:07,136 --> 00:50:10,505
This herb heals the
stomach cramps.

391
00:50:10,506 --> 00:50:14,783
This is for the headache
and the sicknesses of the mind.

392
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:20,102
And this herb is for girls with
thin blood, without passion!

393
00:50:21,194 --> 00:50:25,673
This is for the gout
and for the toothache.

394
00:50:27,185 --> 00:50:31,318
Come on, people, I give you health for
free. And don't look upwards, but at me

395
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:36,809
I can see far. I prophesy.
I am hope and salvation for...

396
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,381
You make fools of us! But we won't
allow to be outsmarted by that cheat!

397
00:50:41,225 --> 00:50:45,400
Even if you say that he is tsar Peter
the Third himself! Some believe you.

398
00:50:45,401 --> 00:50:48,777
You will believe too,
sooner than you think...

399
00:50:49,944 --> 00:50:52,652
Markovic.
-I know everything,

400
00:50:52,653 --> 00:50:56,845
but I don't know who bribed you
to cheat all these people.

401
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:58,682
What did you say?

402
00:50:58,683 --> 00:51:02,261
Take back your words, Markovic!
-I won't take them back, Tanovic.

403
00:51:02,262 --> 00:51:06,440
Come on, Markovic, old mate,
smash him! Smash him!

404
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:10,185
Smash him!
Come on!

405
00:51:21,858 --> 00:51:24,925
Smash him!
Smash the pagan!

406
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:31,299
Captain Tanovic,
sheathe your sword!

407
00:51:35,822 --> 00:51:39,455
What are you waiting for, friend?
Sheathe your sword!

408
00:51:39,456 --> 00:51:43,407
Our blood should be shed only against
the Turks, and Turks are many!

409
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,474
Come to peace.

410
00:51:48,475 --> 00:51:50,913
And respect each other.

411
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,984
You, deacon, should be punished for
making them shed their own blood!

412
00:52:06,985 --> 00:52:11,104
Lucifer, go away! May the
soil swallow you!

413
00:52:11,105 --> 00:52:13,843
May you burn in the
eternal fire of hell!

414
00:52:13,844 --> 00:52:18,270
Disappear, the son of the devil,
disappear!  -Go away!

415
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:21,024
Don't be a fool, deacon!
-Thief!  -Curse on you!

416
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:25,037
I am afraid neither of the smell of
their incense nor of their anathemas.

417
00:52:25,038 --> 00:52:28,658
But the churches are afraid
of people like me.

418
00:52:30,144 --> 00:52:34,177
I have come to you because
I see many conflicts among you.

419
00:52:35,097 --> 00:52:38,388
My eyes see many diseases
and poverty.

420
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,080
And the Church says
that God has made them.

421
00:52:41,081 --> 00:52:46,138
I follow a great wisdom, and I know
that there's no justice except people's

422
00:52:47,152 --> 00:52:50,222
Two quinces are not ripe yet,
but they will be soon.

423
00:52:50,223 --> 00:52:54,028
Do not try to uncover this
great secret of my identity.

424
00:52:54,029 --> 00:52:58,158
We know who you are! And we know
that you came because of us, our friend

425
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,031
Our dearest Majesty!
-Long live the tsar!

426
00:53:02,032 --> 00:53:07,384
Long live the tsar!!!

427
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:12,766
Long live tsar Peter the Third!

428
00:53:21,238 --> 00:53:24,760
Long live the tsar!

429
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:17,965
I came...
I was passing by...

430
00:54:19,452 --> 00:54:22,001
No... No! No!!!

431
00:54:23,587 --> 00:54:27,260
Your Majesty, for God's sake,
why are you forcing me?

432
00:54:28,027 --> 00:54:31,315
God, help me...
-Where I come from...

433
00:54:31,316 --> 00:54:35,857
man and woman, as soon as they meet,
they immediately start doing...

434
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:38,719
THE thing!
-No!

435
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:44,361
No! Your Majesty,
you cannot marry me.

436
00:54:45,144 --> 00:54:48,796
You are a tsar!  -Tsar can
do whatever he pleases.

437
00:54:48,797 --> 00:54:53,755
Can marry whomever he wants. Besides,
I am not married, I am free...

438
00:54:53,756 --> 00:54:57,869
I am free like a wild goat. I swear
I will marry you.

439
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:00,859
You have my word.

440
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:05,276
You swear by what?
-I don't know, you tell me.

441
00:55:06,051 --> 00:55:09,362
By love and by God.
-By love?

442
00:55:09,363 --> 00:55:13,148
Oh, yes, yes,
by love... And by God.

443
00:55:14,193 --> 00:55:17,885
By Almighty God.
Trust me, I shall marry you.

444
00:55:24,678 --> 00:55:28,148
Your Majesty!
You came to visit us.

445
00:55:28,149 --> 00:55:31,521
To visit me and my daughter.
What an honour!

446
00:55:33,216 --> 00:55:35,885
People say that you are the tsar
of Russia.

447
00:55:35,886 --> 00:55:40,294
They say you are noble,
that you can heal and console.

448
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,733
This people are lucky
to have you here.

449
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:47,005
Do sit, please.

450
00:55:47,006 --> 00:55:48,922
Do sit, please.

451
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:57,230
Your Majesty, never before have we
encountered greater horrors. -The hell.

452
00:55:57,231 --> 00:56:00,840
The hell is the paradise compared
to this hell on the earth.

453
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,858
With my own eyes I watched
my house in flame.

454
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:07,168
My wife and son were
thrown to the fire by Turks.

455
00:56:07,169 --> 00:56:10,868
I asked God why he was
punishing me.

456
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:15,783
I asked myself if I ever
did an evil thing to anyone.

457
00:56:15,784 --> 00:56:19,849
I didn't.
You tell me, good man...

458
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,754
will the end to this suffering
ever come?

459
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:26,921
They accepted us here
as we'd been their own.

460
00:56:26,922 --> 00:56:33,094
And I thank them. But what if the power
of hell interferes here as well one day?

461
00:56:33,095 --> 00:56:36,392
I don't care for myself.
I live for her.

462
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:41,240
For her happiness...
If it ever comes...

463
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:46,913
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I know, it's difficult for all of us.

464
00:56:48,052 --> 00:56:52,266
But I cannot
ease my pain...

465
00:57:13,771 --> 00:57:16,169
Cheers.
-Cheers.

466
00:57:16,170 --> 00:57:18,893
To you, tsar, sent to us
by the Almighty Himself.

467
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:22,978
To your health,
happiness and joy.

468
00:57:36,468 --> 00:57:40,028
You asked, my lord,
what are the people most afraid of.

469
00:57:40,029 --> 00:57:43,745
I swear, of everything. Of one
another, of great powers...

470
00:57:44,778 --> 00:57:47,859
of Venice and Turkey,

471
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:51,832
and our land is dry. We must
bow and toil.

472
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:55,565
And we, instead of a hoe,
always carry only guns!

473
00:57:55,566 --> 00:57:59,158
I must admit, captain, this wine
of yours is excellent!

474
00:57:59,159 --> 00:58:01,964
The wine is from Crnica,
and the bread from the hills.

475
00:58:01,965 --> 00:58:04,954
But it still doesn't suffice.

476
00:58:04,955 --> 00:58:06,981
That's why it is so good.

477
00:58:06,982 --> 00:58:10,226
You are low in number too,
a handful of people,

478
00:58:10,227 --> 00:58:13,783
but it is also good. You really
should, from time to time...

479
00:58:13,784 --> 00:58:17,427
be destroyed a little.

480
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:21,189
Don't say that, my lord.
-I was just making a joke.

481
00:58:23,048 --> 00:58:28,116
Just to make your manhood and
bravery more firm, as you say...

482
00:58:28,117 --> 00:58:32,946
and to be honest, I don't really
make a difference between these two.

483
00:58:32,947 --> 00:58:34,199
You don't?

484
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,177
Kuchi, those people who came with gifts
to accept you as the tsar...

485
00:58:39,178 --> 00:58:45,353
say this: bravery is when I defend
myself from other's evil doing.

486
00:58:45,354 --> 00:58:49,468
And manhood is when I defend
others from the evil in myself.

487
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:52,492
You mean: from my own evil doing?

488
00:58:53,611 --> 00:58:57,197
Well, my lord, yes...

489
00:59:03,435 --> 00:59:06,696
Praise the Lord, the Duke Dolgorukov
have just came from St. Petersburg!

490
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:10,711
He brought the cossacks with him.
This will be the end of Shcepan!

491
00:59:10,712 --> 00:59:13,753
The good-for-nothing is
finished! Finished!

492
00:59:13,754 --> 00:59:17,717
Thank you, Almighty!
-Oh God!

493
00:59:19,096 --> 00:59:21,403
Thank you.

494
00:59:26,902 --> 00:59:31,378
I am sorry to interrupt your dinner,
but I must tell you a piece of news...

495
00:59:31,379 --> 00:59:34,914
that will probably upset
you a little.  -Turks?

496
00:59:34,915 --> 00:59:37,233
No, not Turks.

497
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:42,309
Russians...

498
00:59:43,832 --> 00:59:46,883
Leaded by Duke Dolgorukov, the
tsarina's favorite himself!

499
00:59:48,654 --> 00:59:50,370
Have a nice meal!

500
00:59:56,421 --> 00:59:59,337
What should we do,
Your Majesty?

501
01:00:03,778 --> 01:00:05,976
I'll have an audience with him.

502
01:00:36,038 --> 01:00:38,104
Did you personally sent the pigeon?

503
01:00:38,105 --> 01:00:44,475
Yes, duke. People believe that
this scum is tsar Peter the Third.

504
01:00:45,246 --> 01:00:50,151
He came even to the monastery!
And the people is always the same...

505
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:53,824
They want an emperor,
even the false one.

506
01:00:54,012 --> 01:00:56,668
People wants and believe.

507
01:00:57,144 --> 01:01:01,089
Your highness, do something,
as you have a great power.

508
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:03,213
We want things to be as
they used to be.

509
01:01:03,731 --> 01:01:09,640
I'm powerless 'cause this stupid people
accepted him as a tsar. - Thank you.

510
01:01:16,436 --> 01:01:17,701
Follow me!

511
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:04,416
By God's grace,
we, Katarina the Second...

512
01:02:04,417 --> 01:02:07,975
the highest and most powerful
empress of Russia...

513
01:02:08,544 --> 01:02:11,224
by this empress's note we announce:

514
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:14,998
Survival of you Montenegrins
is up to you.

515
01:02:14,999 --> 01:02:19,082
While the doors of our grace
and good will are opened...

516
01:02:20,774 --> 01:02:24,283
we expect that you'll throw into
chains and expel...

517
01:02:24,622 --> 01:02:28,530
usurper, so called tsar Peter
the Third known as Shcepan.

518
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:35,842
Otherwise, we will be forced to
deprive you of our protection and grace.

519
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:43,526
If you don't obey, you will be only to
blame for ruining of Montenegrin people.

520
01:02:44,222 --> 01:02:49,994
The sword of Venice and Turkey is above
your heads. Our sword isn't. Yet.

521
01:02:52,532 --> 01:02:56,071
This is the decree from St. Petersburg,

522
01:02:56,072 --> 01:03:02,691
 by order of Her emperor
highness, tsarina Katarina the Second.

523
01:03:03,116 --> 01:03:06,566
Thank you, duke. Tsar
Shcepan will be glad to receive you.

524
01:03:07,466 --> 01:03:11,232
Before that you'll have to order your
soldiers to withdraw to the end of the hall.

525
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,851
Don't ask for blood.

526
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,771
Soldiers, step back.

527
01:03:27,754 --> 01:03:29,246
Step back!

528
01:03:50,998 --> 01:03:55,090
My dear, you really think
that I believe you are Peter the Third?

529
01:03:55,870 --> 01:04:00,158
Cowherd! Tramp! I'll stab
your stomach!

530
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:04,931
You tramp!
You're gonna set countries to war!

531
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:23,381
I'll burn you!

532
01:04:23,997 --> 01:04:27,966
I'll do anything you want. Anything!
-Here is what you are going to do...

533
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:34,811
Instead of the tsarina, you'll
sign that you accept me as a tsar.

534
01:04:35,922 --> 01:04:41,383
If you don't do that, you'll be dead.
Your bones will rotten here.  -I will!

535
01:04:42,015 --> 01:04:45,766
Tell them that you are dear
guest of mine tonight.  -Very well.

536
01:04:47,357 --> 01:04:50,572
And let them know that you
are leaving at dawn.

537
01:04:53,489 --> 01:05:00,349
Soldiers! Tonight we drink for tsar
Shcepan. At dawn we are leaving!

538
01:05:21,581 --> 01:05:27,408
Good evening!  -Welcome.
-Good evening.  -Do sit, please.

539
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:36,528
What is the matter, father?

540
01:05:48,687 --> 01:05:50,637
I've heard the agreement Shcepan
had with the duke.

541
01:05:50,997 --> 01:05:57,081
He will marry a Russian princess.
Higher interests of the country. As if!

542
01:05:57,994 --> 01:06:02,697
We must run from here! Run! And
devil will take him from here... Once.

543
01:06:03,096 --> 01:06:05,750
Bloody imposter!

544
01:06:23,831 --> 01:06:30,648
No! No! No!
Father, I won't live anymore!

545
01:06:32,044 --> 01:06:36,970
I know that you love him, but
the suicide is a great sin.

546
01:06:39,447 --> 01:06:40,715
Don't, Elfa...

547
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:47,590
Father, help us.
-There is someone higher than the tsar.

548
01:06:48,831 --> 01:06:55,220
And that is church. It would be honored
if she became its nun.

549
01:06:55,221 --> 01:06:57,536
A nun!

550
01:06:59,086 --> 01:07:02,591
Father, you let...
Please!

551
01:07:02,858 --> 01:07:04,489
Let it be...

552
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:18,143
In the name of bey of Rumelia, Mahmut-pasha,
and in name of sultan, son of the Sun...

553
01:07:18,677 --> 01:07:24,640
I'm telling you that if you don't give us Shcepan
that got you for senseless things 'till tomorrow,

554
01:07:24,934 --> 01:07:27,745
we will burn every
corner of Montenegro!

555
01:07:28,230 --> 01:07:33,396
And you, so called tsar that stir
the people up against mighty kingdoms,

556
01:07:33,645 --> 01:07:40,072
you will be stuck on spit as a ram. If that
doesn't happen, expect our army at dawn!

557
01:07:41,422 --> 01:07:46,245
This time there is no hope for you!
Don't expect help from no one!

558
01:07:47,238 --> 01:07:49,768
Everyone has left you.
Russians and Venice.

559
01:07:51,414 --> 01:07:55,313
There will be a lot of spits
in this wolves nest!

560
01:07:55,693 --> 01:08:00,144
Listen to me! There is no one here
willing to give him to you!

561
01:08:01,070 --> 01:08:06,077
We are waiting for you at down!
And tell to the bey of Rumelia...

562
01:08:06,549 --> 01:08:08,723
...that Shcepan still enjoys the
full confidence of our chiefs.

563
01:08:09,271 --> 01:08:13,556
Don't praise the day before the dawn,
or a sword before the end of the battle!

564
01:08:13,868 --> 01:08:15,917
Or that so called tsar
of yours!

565
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:21,788
Allah is my witness that the message
is delivered as it was sent!

566
01:08:36,361 --> 01:08:38,590
You really won't give me to them?

567
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:44,378
No, we won't.
Would you left us?

568
01:08:47,132 --> 01:08:48,578
We are brothers...

569
01:08:54,334 --> 01:08:57,970
Shcepan... Our tsar...

570
01:08:58,912 --> 01:09:01,500
We aren't murderers.

571
01:09:47,093 --> 01:09:52,185
Fen-olah-fen-olah...

572
01:09:56,491 --> 01:09:58,161
Hello, Farfa!

573
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:04,400
Hello, Farfa!

574
01:10:05,338 --> 01:10:07,724
Are you all right?
-Yes, I am. And you?

575
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,773
We mustn't waste a second!
Turks will come at down and then...

576
01:10:13,456 --> 01:10:17,154
Then nothing! Turks will attack and
burn Montenegro.

577
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,200
But you have enough time to come
back down there.  -Where to?

578
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:25,580
To my home?
No...

579
01:10:26,503 --> 01:10:28,933
Oh! You obviously
do not miss your wife.

580
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:34,224
If you want to send regards to anyone
before leaving, I'll wait in the road.

581
01:10:36,683 --> 01:10:42,647
But I can't leave just like that.
Not these people that love me so much.

582
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:49,037
Listen, Farfa, we changed the plan and
made a political turn.

583
01:10:50,036 --> 01:10:54,448
Our cause in Russia is now supported.
We don't need Peter the Third anymore.

584
01:10:56,411 --> 01:11:00,046
I advise you to leave right away.
Politics, you know...

585
01:11:02,276 --> 01:11:08,079
No!
I can't.

586
01:11:09,362 --> 01:11:12,164
Turks are coming tomorrow.
-Don't think about Montenegro.

587
01:11:12,718 --> 01:11:16,058
It won't be the first time for them
to be burned by Turks.

588
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,230
And the people?

589
01:11:19,130 --> 01:11:23,340
They didn't want to give me to Turks.
They are different than I thought.

590
01:11:23,978 --> 01:11:29,432
Farfa, don't get carried away by earthly
things. Be obedient and go down there.

591
01:11:31,078 --> 01:11:34,482
This time, I can't follow the orders.

592
01:11:35,316 --> 01:11:37,569
I am staying here.

593
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:42,171
Something happened in me.

594
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:48,637
Something... something...

595
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:58,837
Farfa, in confidence, if you don't do that
your powers will be taken away from you.

596
01:11:59,931 --> 01:12:04,386
You'll become ordinary, mortal man.

597
01:12:04,969 --> 01:12:11,148
You'll be punished as every outlaw!

598
01:12:12,462 --> 01:12:13,666
No!

599
01:12:44,672 --> 01:12:50,526
Olah... I want help.
I am asking for help!

600
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:52,976
Turks are coming!

601
01:13:41,186 --> 01:13:43,178
They took away my powers.

602
01:13:46,143 --> 01:13:49,749
I can do without them!
Captain Tanovic!

603
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:53,082
Sergeant! Captain!

604
01:16:48,506 --> 01:17:28,035
<i># Traditional song #<i></i>

605
01:17:54,716 --> 01:17:57,022
Hail tsar!

606
01:18:42,708 --> 01:18:46,989
Hail, my brothers!
You that chose me for your tsar!

607
01:18:48,712 --> 01:18:53,216
Many times I've been told
to go the other path!

608
01:18:54,220 --> 01:19:00,445
I didn't want that! I chose destiny of
an ordinary man and I'm happy for that!

609
01:19:01,914 --> 01:19:08,098
I'm small, smallest among you because we
are great only if we are able to be small.

610
01:19:09,374 --> 01:19:15,767
I have learn't that from the people.
And I'm covered with silk and jewels...

611
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:19,351
...and most of you don't have
even the basic things.

612
01:19:20,618 --> 01:19:23,775
Take this, Tanovic!
Where does this come from?

613
01:19:24,963 --> 01:19:26,480
Where from?

614
01:19:27,518 --> 01:19:30,603
This is from your suffering
and it belongs to you!

615
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:38,341
Hail the tsar!

616
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,330
Announce my decree.

617
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:21,839
We, the people of Montenegro, through
our servant, tsar Shcepan The Little...

618
01:20:22,269 --> 01:20:24,811
announce our free will.

619
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,339
Treasure of church and rich people is
going to be used for building schools...

620
01:20:29,435 --> 01:20:33,431
...roads and everything that
people need.

621
01:20:34,143 --> 01:20:37,349
Is that your will?
- YES, it is!

622
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,250
Come, come...

623
01:20:43,616 --> 01:20:47,896
For killing of our brothers and
spreading discord among people...

624
01:20:48,743 --> 01:20:53,677
we announce death penalty and
destroying of home. Is that your will?

625
01:21:03,551 --> 01:21:08,976
And now, we are telling to everyone!

626
01:21:10,243 --> 01:21:15,005
To mighty Ranier, duke of Venice,
to mighty Katarina,

627
01:21:15,348 --> 01:21:19,004
to sultan Ahmet, son of the Sun and
brother of the Moon,

628
01:21:20,633 --> 01:21:24,500
to wise Louis of France,
to honorable Joseph of Austria

629
01:21:24,829 --> 01:21:28,920
...not to extend their bloody hands
to small, poor Montenegro...

630
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:31,936
...because I, Shcepan The Little...

631
01:21:33,046 --> 01:21:37,375
am sending a message to forces of
heaven and forces of hell...

632
01:21:37,896 --> 01:21:43,410
that I'll be good with good ones,
and evil with others.

633
01:21:46,311 --> 01:21:52,280
Shcepan, our tsar, we are poor
and thirsty in these rocks.

634
01:21:52,891 --> 01:21:55,142
We and our cattle, too.

635
01:21:55,904 --> 01:22:01,137
You forgot about wells.
-Tanovic, write that down.

636
01:22:02,322 --> 01:22:04,977
We'll make a well in every village
before the winter.

637
01:22:06,082 --> 01:22:09,497
Thank you, our tsar,
and don't be mad at me.

638
01:22:16,076 --> 01:22:19,704
Long live our tsar!

639
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:33,847
Your highness...

640
01:23:34,797 --> 01:23:37,932
You have to sign orders about
vineyards and roads,

641
01:23:37,933 --> 01:23:40,927
and a letter to the Republic
of Dubrovnik.

642
01:23:46,986 --> 01:23:54,419
Elfa...
It's hard without her...

643
01:23:55,545 --> 01:23:57,573
But Elfa is a nun.
Forget about her.

644
01:23:58,382 --> 01:24:00,796
You are not an ordinary man.
You are a tsar.

645
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,903
Yes, Tanovic, a tsar, but also a man
who is in love.

646
01:24:06,135 --> 01:24:08,263
An ordinary man.

647
01:24:22,072 --> 01:24:23,422
Stop!

648
01:24:25,349 --> 01:24:26,892
What is it?

649
01:24:30,467 --> 01:24:34,357
What do you want?  -They are ready
to forgive you for your disobedience.

650
01:24:34,925 --> 01:24:38,026
But you must come back.
At once.

651
01:24:39,652 --> 01:24:43,501
They forgave me, you say?
They forgave me for what?

652
01:24:44,951 --> 01:24:49,748
For thinking with my own head? For
not wanting to serve to your intentions?

653
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:53,078
Is that what you say?
You are an outlaw.

654
01:24:53,079 --> 01:24:56,065
It looks like you started
to work somebody else.

655
01:24:56,531 --> 01:25:00,430
Yes. I work, but
I don't work for you any more.

656
01:25:00,966 --> 01:25:06,616
You created Gingis Khan, Nero, Atilla.
You are fed on slavery and hate.

657
01:25:07,710 --> 01:25:11,341
I want to live freely. It's over!
I don't want to have anything with you!

658
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:17,086
You will regret for this, Farfa.
You will!

659
01:25:17,810 --> 01:25:19,172
You'll pay for this, Farfa!

660
01:25:20,604 --> 01:25:25,029
I don't want to see
you in Montenegro ever again, you spy!

661
01:25:49,941 --> 01:25:51,673
Stop!

662
01:25:54,137 --> 01:25:55,781
I know where are you going to,

663
01:25:55,782 --> 01:26:00,319
 and we decided to make you
happy by blessing your love to Elfa.

664
01:26:00,934 --> 01:26:07,820
Who are you?  -Me?
I'm representing all churches.

665
01:26:08,988 --> 01:26:12,797
If you don't want to go along with hell,
bring the people that loves you to us.

666
01:26:13,548 --> 01:26:17,086
And you will be rewarded.
-No, I won't.

667
01:26:18,056 --> 01:26:21,779
I wouldn't be free there either.
-Don't blow in the wind, Shcepan.

668
01:26:22,485 --> 01:26:24,730
You fight with same strength
against hell and against church.

669
01:26:24,731 --> 01:26:27,182
You want something third.

670
01:26:28,255 --> 01:26:32,653
There isn't something like that. You have
to be with someone. Choose your side.

671
01:26:33,434 --> 01:26:36,069
It's a deal and
here are the gold coins.

672
01:26:38,002 --> 01:26:41,470
This is all yours.
-I'll rather stick to the gospel.

673
01:26:42,273 --> 01:26:46,185
Let it be God's what is God's
and Ceasar's what is Ceasar's.

674
01:26:53,126 --> 01:26:58,252
Farfa... Crazy Farfa!

675
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:25,060
We must brutally punish
that little outlaw!

676
01:27:26,531 --> 01:27:30,886
We must prevent him to disturb
order of things on earth.

677
01:27:32,099 --> 01:27:40,116
For that is the most dangerous and it
can be a bad example to other nations.

678
01:27:41,135 --> 01:27:47,471
Let that be done by Justine.
She has personal reasons for that.

679
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:51,911
Send that whore Zephira with her.

680
01:28:28,999 --> 01:28:31,657
Elfa!

681
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:36,906
Why did you run away
from our love?

682
01:28:36,907 --> 01:28:42,125
 I became a nun when I heard
about your wedding.

683
01:28:42,990 --> 01:28:45,618
Who said that nonsense?
I'll punish him!

684
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:49,880
 He'll pay for that with his own
head! He will be the first I hanged!

685
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:55,051
Don't say vengeful words
on a place like this!

686
01:28:57,849 --> 01:29:02,959
We better accept our destiny.
-Now? Now I make my destiny!

687
01:29:08,386 --> 01:29:12,033
Elfa, Elfa...

688
01:30:24,310 --> 01:30:29,856
Farfa! Farfa!

689
01:30:35,896 --> 01:30:38,240
Farfa!

690
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:45,726
Elfa, did you hear something?
-No.

691
01:31:29,746 --> 01:31:34,381
Heeeey!
Justine!

692
01:32:09,008 --> 01:32:13,177
Guard!  -Here I am!
-I drove two ladies from Venice.

693
01:32:13,178 --> 01:32:17,455
They bring gifts and regards to
His Highness, tsar Shcepan.

694
01:32:18,014 --> 01:32:20,123
Grand duke is sending them.

695
01:32:56,003 --> 01:32:58,288
What the world means to
me now...

696
01:32:58,289 --> 01:33:01,359
it is hard to understand, Elfa.

697
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:06,469
No-one asks me where I
came from, or of what origin I am.

698
01:33:08,287 --> 01:33:12,542
I know that all powers are against me
except people's.

699
01:33:12,543 --> 01:33:17,118
Because I'm saying what people say:

700
01:33:18,388 --> 01:33:22,718
There can never be too much
of love and freedom.

701
01:33:29,973 --> 01:33:32,608
Look at that scum, Zephira.

702
01:33:41,501 --> 01:33:44,713
What are you doing here?
Who has sent you?  -Good evening.

703
01:33:47,196 --> 01:33:49,795
Come here, deacon...  -I've heard that
you came from Venice...

704
01:33:49,796 --> 01:33:54,091
 and that you brought
gifts to that false tsar, that scum!

705
01:33:54,514 --> 01:33:59,543
The church never accepted him!
-This time we have the same interest.

706
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:06,474
He brings unrest. That Shcepan bothers
everyone!  -Yes, madam. He is Satan.

707
01:34:07,267 --> 01:34:11,090
Lucifer.  -If he were Lucifer
you would easily make a deal with him.

708
01:34:12,242 --> 01:34:15,522
Tell the prior to bring me Palikarda.
The rest is up to me.

709
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:19,168
Prior, bring Palikarda.

710
01:34:20,424 --> 01:34:23,201
Zephira will explain everything to you.

711
01:34:27,868 --> 01:34:32,295
I'm so glad...
I'll tell you everything...

712
01:35:02,154 --> 01:35:09,742
We must kill Shcepan,
we must kill Shcepan...

713
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:43,052
Madam, this is Stanko Palikarda.

714
01:35:45,899 --> 01:35:48,261
The deacon is in there.
Bring him.

715
01:35:49,004 --> 01:35:56,892
My intentions are good. My name
is Justine, I am a wife of Shcepan's.

716
01:35:57,145 --> 01:36:02,248
Wife?  -Yes, he tricked
you and your daughter.

717
01:36:03,461 --> 01:36:08,314
My daughter is in the monastery.
- Come. Come and see.

718
01:36:13,657 --> 01:36:15,867
Take a look.

719
01:36:52,010 --> 01:36:56,847
I'll kill him. I'll kill him...
- Kill him!

720
01:36:58,297 --> 01:37:01,543
Kill him. Revenge yourself,
my friend.

721
01:37:01,544 --> 01:37:04,994
We will share your
sin with you.

722
01:37:05,094 --> 01:37:06,864
I won't sin!
I don't want a sin on my soul!

723
01:37:07,502 --> 01:37:12,168
I don't want to sin against God.
I am servant of God, I won't sin!

724
01:37:13,029 --> 01:37:14,929
I am not a killer!
I won't sin! I won't sin!

725
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:19,010
Only God may take away
one's life! Only God!

726
01:38:59,787 --> 01:39:03,788
Father!
Father!

727
01:39:31,653 --> 01:39:38,293
Shcepan, the tsar!
Farfa...

728
01:40:36,986 --> 01:40:42,124
Subbed and translated by:
Crnnica and NinaNish

729
01:40:51,511 --> 01:40:54,467
THE END
