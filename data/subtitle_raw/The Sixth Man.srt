1
00:02:28,604 --> 00:02:30,648
Defense, help, help, help!

2
00:02:39,406 --> 00:02:42,535
Time-out. Somebody call time-out.

3
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:47,873
- Get over here! Come here. Come on!
- We're coming, we're coming.

4
00:02:47,998 --> 00:02:50,167
Antoine. Son, how many times
I gotta tell you

5
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:52,503
don't knock the ball into the parking lot?

6
00:02:52,628 --> 00:02:55,130
- Yes, Dad.
- Nice shot.

7
00:02:55,256 --> 00:02:58,050
All right, fellas, listen up.
This is what it is.

8
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:00,469
We're down by one point,
28 seconds to go.

9
00:03:00,594 --> 00:03:03,389
We gotta get the ball back.
Make 'em give it up, understand?

10
00:03:03,514 --> 00:03:05,057
- Yes.
- All right.

11
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:07,268
- I want Kenny to take the last shot.
- Let me!

12
00:03:07,393 --> 00:03:09,019
- This one's on Kenny.
- He'll miss it!

13
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:11,063
- Antoine!
- But the guy's all over me.

14
00:03:11,188 --> 00:03:14,525
- What if I can't get open for a shot?
- Henry, can you set a pick for him?

15
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,318
- That's all it takes.
- Henry's wack!

16
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:18,654
Antoine, get serious.

17
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:21,240
Henry's gonna set the pick,
you gonna take the shot,

18
00:03:21,365 --> 00:03:25,327
you gonna bring it up, all right?
Now give me some hands.

19
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,165
Hands! Last chance. Get real.

20
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:31,876
Win!

21
00:03:32,001 --> 00:03:34,170
Now let's get out there
and beat somebody!

22
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:37,798
You want me to shoot
to win the game? Me?

23
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:41,343
I want you to shoot to win.
You can do it, son.

24
00:03:43,846 --> 00:03:46,182
A and K, all the way!

25
00:03:46,307 --> 00:03:47,933
- Oh, Ma.
- Oh, man.

26
00:03:49,685 --> 00:03:52,229
OK, boys, let's play some ball!

27
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:57,109
Kenny!

28
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,361
Go, Kenny!

29
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:05,576
Go, go, go! Kenny, go! Shoot it!

30
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,331
What?

31
00:04:10,456 --> 00:04:11,707
All right, all right.

32
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,142
- I can't believe that.
- That's so not cool.

33
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:32,394
You played great, guys.

34
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:35,105
- Come on, bro, it's all right.
- Oh, man.

35
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:38,359
- Come on.
- Dang.

36
00:04:38,484 --> 00:04:41,987
- I should have made that.
- It's all right. It's all right.

37
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:45,407
Hold them heads up. It's all right.
It's all right. You're still my boys.

38
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:47,743
Come on, man.
Just give me the ball.

39
00:04:47,868 --> 00:04:48,869
All right.

40
00:04:48,994 --> 00:04:51,580
Can't you see I'm in the zone?
Just pass the ball.

41
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:53,415
All right.

42
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:58,921
- You missed a lay-up. So what?
- So what? So what?!

43
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:03,342
Man, we lost! We lost because of me!
Man, I don't get it.

44
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:07,680
I had 'em with the Antoine lookaway.
I had my tongue hanging out like Mike.

45
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:10,391
There's no way that shot doesn't drop.

46
00:05:10,516 --> 00:05:13,060
Unless that tongue's
got some aerodynamic properties,

47
00:05:13,185 --> 00:05:15,104
it's not gonna help you make a lay-up.

48
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:17,314
That's what I said,
aerodynamic properties.

49
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,440
Tell it to Mike.

50
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:21,235
Come on, James.
Those two need to come on inside,

51
00:05:21,318 --> 00:05:23,362
get their homework done and go to bed.

52
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:26,490
- Aw, Ma, just a couple more minutes?
- Come on… please!

53
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:29,869
- Don't "Aw, Ma" me.
- Give us a minute, sweetheart.

54
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:36,500
Look… if you play the game
with passion and dignity,

55
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,211
it'll take you anywhere you want to go.

56
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:43,257
Cut it out. Hook up.

57
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:54,518
All you boys gotta do is stick together.
You do that, anything can happen.

58
00:05:54,643 --> 00:05:57,897
Do you understand
what that means? Anything.

59
00:06:00,065 --> 00:06:02,151
All right. Go on inside.

60
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:05,196
- Aw, Dad.
- Go inside.

61
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:09,116
Get in the house before your mom
come out here and snatch you up.

62
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:11,535
Hey, hold up, little man.

63
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,754
You know, I think you would've
made that shot today.

64
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:26,008
You gotta have faith, Kenny.
It's in here, man. Right here.

65
00:06:27,051 --> 00:06:30,679
You just gotta trust it, all right?

66
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,808
- Go on inside.
- OK.

67
00:06:34,934 --> 00:06:38,646
- Take Murphy with you.
- All right. Come on, Murphy. Let's go.

68
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,649
If you help me do my homework,
I'll get you a biscuit.

69
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:06,465
And Kenny Tyler
serves up the alley-oop

70
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,926
and Antoine Tyler slams it home.

71
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:13,389
And that's the one-two punch. And the
Tyler brothers cannot be stopped.

72
00:07:15,057 --> 00:07:16,308
A no-look pass from Kenny Tyler

73
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:19,895
and a double-fisted "slam, bam,
thank you ma'am" from Antoine Tyler.

74
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,022
The Huskies are within one
of the Wildcats.

75
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:23,774
78-77, a ten-one run,

76
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:26,360
and Lute Olson's gonna call
a time-out here to regroup.

77
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:28,153
Bernie, what else
can we say about him?

78
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:30,614
A lot, Ernie. Let me tell you,
there's no question

79
00:07:30,739 --> 00:07:32,992
he's the reason
the Huskies are 19 and six.

80
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:36,871
Antoine Tyler just will
not allow this team to lose.

81
00:07:36,996 --> 00:07:39,790
Virtually overlooked in pre-season polls,
they have scraped

82
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:43,210
and clawed their way
into the top of Pac-10 standings.

83
00:07:43,335 --> 00:07:47,423
You did a little scraping and clawing
yourself last night there, Bernie.

84
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:51,468
Incidentally, if they win the Pac-10,
it'll be the first time since 1985.

85
00:07:51,594 --> 00:07:55,181
And that is a long, long,
long, long, long time to wait.

86
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:59,476
And here's Harry the Husky
to attempt his patented slam dunk.

87
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:03,731
Let's give him a big hand, folks.
And let's cross our fingers, too.

88
00:08:06,317 --> 00:08:09,778
Harry the Husky
on the run and the fly…

89
00:08:09,904 --> 00:08:12,990
Whoa! Split the crossbeams
on that one.

90
00:08:13,115 --> 00:08:16,535
Did we make it?

91
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:19,330
- Huskies!
- Yeah!

92
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:24,293
OK, we were 15 down at the half. We
fought like hell to get back in this thing,

93
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:28,589
so let's not run out of steam, all right?
We gotta force a turnover.

94
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:29,798
Malik?

95
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:34,220
Malik, what are tho… Are those shorts
or a pair of damn hip-huggers?

96
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,473
Yo, Coach, it's the '90s. It's a style thing.

97
00:08:37,598 --> 00:08:40,893
Here's my style thing.
I want you all over McCailiff, OK?

98
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,687
He goes to the crapper,
I want you standing ready to wipe him.

99
00:08:43,771 --> 00:08:45,064
- I got him. Let's go.
- Good.

100
00:08:45,189 --> 00:08:48,234
Zigi… Listen, you're
the last line of defense.

101
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:51,111
They get a breakaway,
I'll have you back in Siberia eating ice.

102
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:53,489
- It is Serbia, Coach.
- Whatever.

103
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:55,366
Listen, double-down on their guards.

104
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:58,160
I want them to think we're playing
with eight guys out there.

105
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:01,247
If they make a pass half-court,
they're gonna win the game.

106
00:09:01,372 --> 00:09:02,748
- Danny.
- Yeah, Coach?

107
00:09:02,873 --> 00:09:05,543
I know the game is getting intense,
but don't hit anybody.

108
00:09:05,668 --> 00:09:09,338
- Not unless they deserve it, Coach.
- Hey, hey, Coach? Put me in.

109
00:09:09,463 --> 00:09:14,134
Jimmy, sit down. Now, Kenny,
we need that ball. Go get it for us.

110
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,220
- You got it.
- Are you boys ready for this?

111
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:17,680
- Focus, baby.
- All right.

112
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:20,099
- Yeah!
- Cos it's up to you. Come on.

113
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:21,642
- Let's go!
- Dawgs up, baby!

114
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,352
- Come on.
- Let's go, baby!

115
00:09:23,477 --> 00:09:25,729
- Hey, Coach, is that a new coat?
- Yeah.

116
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:28,190
Still got the receipt?

117
00:09:28,315 --> 00:09:30,526
Antoine, no joking around.
You're my guy.

118
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:34,613
You're my guy, too, Coach. No jokes.
We got this one. Hey, Dawgs up!

119
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:38,617
Let's kick some ass!

120
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:43,831
Kenny Tyler with an alley-oop
and Antoine Tyler, 360 for the slam!

121
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:48,586
And the Huskies win!
The Huskies win it 79-78!

122
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:52,506
Somebody slammed the refrigerator
door and the butter's melting.

123
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:56,594
Antoine Tyler, he's a first-round
draft choice. Count on it.

124
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,679
We'll see you next week
at Pauley Pavilion

125
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:02,850
when the Huskies meet the Bruins
to clinch first place in the Pac-10.

126
00:10:02,975 --> 00:10:05,186
- Kenny! Antoine!
- Mom!

127
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:07,271
You got it. You know you got it.

128
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:14,486
Oh, gosh. Your father would have
been so proud of you both today.

129
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,572
- I wish he could've seen you play.
- So do we.

130
00:10:16,697 --> 00:10:18,365
But his spirit lives on in you.

131
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,533
- Hey, Ma?
- What?

132
00:10:19,658 --> 00:10:21,660
Dawgs up!

133
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:25,664
It's the cabbage patch!

134
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:49,063
Yo. You know what this game is about?
It's about looking good. It's a style thing.

135
00:10:49,188 --> 00:10:51,690
Do you know what I love about
this game? It's so physical.

136
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:53,526
You know, cos I love contact.

137
00:10:53,651 --> 00:10:54,860
You know how I see myself?

138
00:10:54,985 --> 00:10:57,905
I see myself as the African
ambassador of basketball.

139
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:00,241
Hello, ladies, I'm Zigi. Zigi Hrbacek.

140
00:11:00,366 --> 00:11:04,370
I'm from Serbia. I play for UDub.
I am seven feet tall.

141
00:11:04,495 --> 00:11:08,958
Today was an off night. I had 30 points,
I believe 15 assists, 12 rebounds.

142
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,211
- Stubbs, you never play.
- Oh, you probably had bad seats.

143
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,839
No, Stubbs, I go to every game.
This guy never plays.

144
00:11:20,803 --> 00:11:21,929
- Antoine!
- Yeah. OK.

145
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:24,431
That's my boy right there!

146
00:11:24,557 --> 00:11:26,433
Can I have a pitcher of beer, please?

147
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,894
- You got it, Kenny.
- Thank you.

148
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:33,649
- You go, RC!
- Yeah, that's good.

149
00:11:35,276 --> 00:11:39,154
20 dollars. 20 dollars.

150
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,657
Easy money. Easy cheese.

151
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:45,870
Here you go, blind boy.

152
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:50,708
Hey, man!

153
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,169
Who took us all the way to…

154
00:11:56,046 --> 00:11:57,715
And I…

155
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,301
Hey, hey! Get your nasty ass outta here!

156
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:02,928
Whoa! OK! OK!

157
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:14,773
- Where am I at?
- Come on. Shoot it!

158
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:18,777
What the…?

159
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:24,200
I am so… I am so sor…
I am - I am so sorry.

160
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:29,580
Sorry.

161
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,707
It's over there.

162
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:47,223
Can you believe that seven-foot Serbian
tried to pay me in traveller's cheques?

163
00:12:47,348 --> 00:12:50,434
Why are you taking that man's drachma
or whatever it's called?

164
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,896
- I need 'em, that's why. Come on.
- Lucky shot, man. Lucky shot.

165
00:12:54,021 --> 00:12:57,566
Danny, don't even try it.
I'll shoot 'em on you all day.

166
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:01,195
Hey, that was a hell of a shot, dog.
I bought you a drink.

167
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,366
"l bought you a drink."
Sit your drunk ass down.

168
00:13:05,491 --> 00:13:08,410
Hey, Cheryl. Hey, Cheryl.
What's happening, baby?

169
00:13:08,536 --> 00:13:10,329
- I was just gonna call you.
- Yeah?

170
00:13:10,454 --> 00:13:13,457
- Yeah.
- Dialing cramps your shooting hand?

171
00:13:13,582 --> 00:13:17,211
No. We just got this tournament coming
up, see. I'm trying to keep my edge.

172
00:13:17,336 --> 00:13:20,381
- You don't want me to lose my edge?
- Oh, no, Antoine.

173
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:24,718
I don't want you losing your edge, cos
I ain't gonna be around to help you find it.

174
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:26,846
- Come on, now. Hold on.
- Let me go.

175
00:13:26,971 --> 00:13:29,849
Come on, girl. What you mean?
You not gonna be around?

176
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:32,935
- No, I'm not gonna be around.
- You really not gonna be around?

177
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:36,230
No, I'm not gonna be around.

178
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,108
- Uh-huh.
- You know, a little something.

179
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,442
- A little something?
- Yeah.

180
00:13:40,568 --> 00:13:42,528
- You'll be around for me?
- Yeah.

181
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:45,239
Can I get some?

182
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,289
- That's my girl. I'm crazy about you.
- You better be.

183
00:13:53,414 --> 00:13:55,249
- Crazy about you, girl.
- Later, baby.

184
00:13:55,374 --> 00:13:59,170
- Crazy about you, girl!
- What are you doing, man?

185
00:13:59,295 --> 00:14:01,172
If you can't treat her right, cut her loose.

186
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:04,550
Stop it. Don't tell me nothing
about females. Stick to Nintendo.

187
00:14:04,675 --> 00:14:08,679
- Aw, come on. What are you saying?
- Your problem is you scared to play.

188
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,140
Look here. I wrote the book
on macking, baby.

189
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:12,683
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

190
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,643
- With these hands.
- Prove it to me then.

191
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:15,769
- What?
- Prove it.

192
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:19,190
Hell, I will bet you ten dollars.
You pick any broad in this club,

193
00:14:19,315 --> 00:14:21,150
I'll get that number tonight.

194
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,152
- OK, let me…
- You pick 'em out.

195
00:14:23,277 --> 00:14:27,990
Hey, hey, no midgets, no cockeyed
broads and no toothless chicks.

196
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:31,076
- Cute ones.
- Ooh, I found her.

197
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:33,329
- Where?
- At the bar. Cutie-pie.

198
00:14:33,454 --> 00:14:36,457
- Which one?
- 4 o'clock. Red bone.

199
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,879
- You gotta pick somebody else, kid.
- Yeah, that's your type.

200
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:47,343
No… I'm just saying… Hey, look,
I'm just trying to make this a fair bet.

201
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:51,263
Better yet, I'll go down and pull her,
she'll make us eggs in the morning.

202
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:54,433
You trying to play me.
I'm gonna show you a real mack, baby.

203
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,435
- You gonna show me?
- Call me Golden.

204
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,438
OK, all right. Go ahead, Golden.
I'm gonna sit up here and watch you

205
00:14:59,563 --> 00:15:02,650
with your mack-daddy crisscross ass.

206
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,070
- I bet a Long Island iced tea.
- I'm betting, too.

207
00:15:09,031 --> 00:15:13,994
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
My bad. Excuse me. Excuse me.

208
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:17,456
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

209
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:21,168
Excuse me.

210
00:15:33,973 --> 00:15:35,724
- Damn!
- Hey.

211
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,893
Hey!

212
00:15:38,018 --> 00:15:40,062
For a guy with 11 assists
and eight rebounds,

213
00:15:40,187 --> 00:15:43,274
you sure got a set of clumsy hands.

214
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,484
Well, sorry.

215
00:15:45,609 --> 00:15:48,028
- I take it you saw the game tonight.
- You look good.

216
00:15:48,153 --> 00:15:50,990
Thank you. I've been working out,
you know what I'm saying?

217
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:53,868
Your game. You look good.

218
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:59,123
Oh. Ow! Damn, that hurt.

219
00:15:59,248 --> 00:16:01,542
How you doing?
I'm the wounded Kenny Tyler.

220
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:07,214
I know. Bit of advice, Kenny Tyler.
You shouldn't make bets you can't win.

221
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:11,260
Wait. Hold up.
Wait. Hold on. What's your name?

222
00:16:11,385 --> 00:16:16,432
- RC St John.
- RC, I'm sorry about your purse!

223
00:16:16,557 --> 00:16:18,434
See that girl with the bloody nose?

224
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,145
Got kicked out of the game
for elbowing that girl?

225
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,022
- Hey…
- I like her. I like her. Ooh!

226
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:26,317
- We got an article by a RC St John.
- Never heard of him.

227
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,693
Who?

228
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:31,238
RC St John, RC St John… That's that
new reporter from the UDub Daily.

229
00:16:31,363 --> 00:16:33,616
Thomas told my boys,
said she's the bomb.

230
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:36,827
Yo, that's Red Bone.
The cutie I tried to talk to at the bar?

231
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,288
Yo, yo, yo, listen to this. Listen to this.

232
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:43,042
"And on a beautiful touch pass
from his brother Kenny,

233
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:47,379
Antoine Tyler sealed one of the
biggest upsets in college basketball."

234
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:50,591
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

235
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:52,635
"While Antoine is the…" Whoa, whoa.

236
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,305
- "..is the engine that runs this team…"
- Oh, she can write now.

237
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:00,851
"..it is his younger brother Kenny who
leaves his mark on virtually every play."

238
00:17:00,976 --> 00:17:03,646
That's a good one.

239
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:08,150
Mouth is all open, you all cockeyed.
"I'm Antoine Tyler, star of the team."

240
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:12,613
"I'm cross-eyed, so I wear glasses."

241
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:15,324
Hey, you want me to beat
you up in front of everybody?

242
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,495
- Damn, why you gotta go there?
- Cos I can, crybaby.

243
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,996
OK, ladies, come on!

244
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:23,916
Let's move it out! We got the
vans waiting. We got a big game.

245
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,125
We're moving. Let's go.

246
00:17:25,251 --> 00:17:28,170
Oh, yeah. I feel good tonight, boy.
It's gonna be a good one.

247
00:17:28,295 --> 00:17:29,588
I'm gonna put on a show tonight.

248
00:17:29,713 --> 00:17:31,382
- I got front-row seats.
- Be there!

249
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:33,551
Aw, come on now.
You know better, son.

250
00:17:33,676 --> 00:17:37,763
And that's 15 for UCLA's Seward,
but the Huskies still hold on

251
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:40,599
by a narrow margin
as we near the five-minute mark.

252
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:43,894
And this seems to be the year
for the Huskies as they topple

253
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,939
one powerhouse after another
en route to their first berth

254
00:17:47,064 --> 00:17:49,400
in the NCAA tournament since 1984.

255
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:53,320
O'Grady will bring it up. Lee guarding
him as they cross midcourt.

256
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:55,656
O'Grady on the dribble.
Goes low post Hrbacek.

257
00:17:55,781 --> 00:17:59,618
Hrbacek back out to O'Grady.
Behind-the-back dribble.

258
00:17:59,743 --> 00:18:02,788
He's gonna feed Kenny Tyler
on the cutter, back to Antoine from 15.

259
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:04,790
Buried it! 46 for Antoine.

260
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:09,587
15 assists for brother Kenny, as they
continue their quest for NCAA magic.

261
00:18:09,712 --> 00:18:13,007
And the Huskies lead by two.

262
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:18,846
As we close in on four minutes,
Lee will bring it up, guarded by O'Grady.

263
00:18:18,971 --> 00:18:20,973
Lee over to Rhem,
guarded by Antoine Tyler.

264
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:24,435
Gonna try to drive the lane,
goes up and rejected by Kenny Tyler.

265
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:27,229
They're gonna call a foul.
And that's number three on Kenny.

266
00:18:27,354 --> 00:18:28,522
That seemed clean to me.

267
00:18:28,647 --> 00:18:32,443
Next time down, run the fist out
and bring him hard across the middle.

268
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:33,736
- A and K.
- All the way.

269
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:36,030
- If you ain't open, who'll you pass it to?
- Who else?

270
00:18:36,155 --> 00:18:38,532
Just making sure you remember.
Don't you forget it.

271
00:18:38,657 --> 00:18:40,451
I can't. You keep pounding it in my head.

272
00:18:40,576 --> 00:18:43,913
Rhem at the line, a 67% foul shooter.
He's been cold tonight.

273
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:46,707
Just four points on the evening.

274
00:18:46,832 --> 00:18:48,834
That one, nothing
but the bottom of the net.

275
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,921
And he'll have another
to try to bring the Bruins even.

276
00:18:52,046 --> 00:18:53,339
Box out! Zigi, rebound!

277
00:18:53,464 --> 00:18:56,967
Rhem to try to tie things up. Young,
the rebound, trying to pass it out to…

278
00:18:57,092 --> 00:19:01,222
Picked off by O'Grady. O'Grady
to open Tyler, he starts a fast break.

279
00:19:01,347 --> 00:19:04,183
And he has brother Antoine
breaking for the basket.

280
00:19:04,308 --> 00:19:07,728
Kenny Tyler on the dish
to brother Antoine

281
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:12,191
as they've done so many times before.
And Antoine for a monster jam!

282
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:14,109
Yeah!

283
00:19:14,235 --> 00:19:17,613
He's a future NBA all-star in the making!

284
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,753
Yeah, baby!

285
00:19:34,922 --> 00:19:36,966
Ant?

286
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:43,472
- All right, back off.
- Watch it, Lik!

287
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:45,099
Ant? Ant, what happened, man?

288
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:47,977
Step back. I wanna check him out.
Please stand back.

289
00:19:48,102 --> 00:19:50,938
- Antoine? Antoine? Yo, you all right?
- It's OK, Kenny.

290
00:19:51,063 --> 00:19:53,274
Let's get the paramedics
and get him on a stretcher.

291
00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:54,650
I'm gonna come with you.

292
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:58,654
No, you stay. We still got the lead.
Finish these bums off, all right?

293
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:01,240
Step back, please.
Let's give him some room.

294
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:03,158
- Let's go!
- All right.

295
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:05,703
- You all right, man? You gonna be OK?
- I'm OK. I'm OK.

296
00:20:05,828 --> 00:20:07,872
Give us some room, please.

297
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,336
- Nichols, go along with him, OK?
- OK, Coach. I'll go with him.

298
00:20:15,337 --> 00:20:19,175
- It's OK. It's gonna be OK.
- I'm right here, kid. You all right?

299
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,220
- I'm all right. I'll be back.
- Ant?

300
00:20:23,345 --> 00:20:25,014
I'll be back, baby.

301
00:20:25,139 --> 00:20:28,392
- Respiration's 35 and shallow.
- You'll be all right.

302
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,895
Is he asthmatic?
Medications? Histories?

303
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:34,440
- No history.
- Let's get a BP on him.

304
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:37,234
- I'll be back.
- You'll be OK, Antoine.

305
00:20:37,318 --> 00:20:38,485
Stay strong.

306
00:20:38,611 --> 00:20:41,113
- He's gonna be all right, OK?
- All right.

307
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:47,912
- Move it! Move it!
- Let's move it!

308
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:51,373
- I can't find a pulse!
- What?

309
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:54,418
One, two, three, four…

310
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,643
You'll be all right, Antoine.

311
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:17,816
- What are you doing?
- Just trying to get his heart started.

312
00:21:18,817 --> 00:21:22,404
- Do something! Come on. Come on.
- Clear!

313
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:40,130
- Can't believe we lost this game!
- We suck. Pathetic.

314
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:43,008
Let's get the hell outta here.

315
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:45,177
Damn!

316
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:00,860
Kenny?

317
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:06,574
Hey, Coach, I'm about to visit Antoine
in the hospital. I gotta get his stuff.

318
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:10,703
- Kenny.
- What, Coach?

319
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:14,957
- We lost him, Kenny.
- What, Coach, for the season?

320
00:22:15,082 --> 00:22:17,334
I told that boy to stop dunking
like he was Jordan.

321
00:22:17,459 --> 00:22:21,714
- What? He dislocated his shoulder?
- Kenny…

322
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:24,300
What, Coach?

323
00:22:25,467 --> 00:22:30,514
Antoine died on the way
to the university hospital.

324
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,852
He what?

325
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:38,522
It was his heart. They don't know why.
I mean, it just…

326
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:43,402
Coach… He just said
he was coming right back.

327
00:22:43,527 --> 00:22:46,739
They tried everything, Kenny, but they…
It happened so fast that…

328
00:22:46,864 --> 00:22:51,327
Nah. Bullshit. Bullshit, he died.
I'm going to the hospital.

329
00:22:51,452 --> 00:22:52,620
- Kenny!
- Kenny, hold on.

330
00:22:52,745 --> 00:22:55,206
- Move. I gotta go. Get off me!
- Come on, man.

331
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:56,749
- Get off me!
- Hold on a second.

332
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,793
- Get off me, man! Luther, get off me!
- Hold up, man! Hold up!

333
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,004
Get off me, man.

334
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:04,465
Calm down, baby.
We'll get through this together.

335
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,635
I'm so sorry, Kenny. I'm so sorry.

336
00:23:09,178 --> 00:23:11,388
Oh, man.

337
00:23:51,345 --> 00:23:53,639
Tyler slowly up court, brings it up…

338
00:23:53,764 --> 00:23:56,767
Oh, and it's stolen away.
Cubby took it like candy from a baby.

339
00:23:56,892 --> 00:23:58,727
This doesn't look good for the Huskies.

340
00:23:58,853 --> 00:24:01,564
This is their three-game losing streak.
They need to snap that

341
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,315
and get on with the game.

342
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,485
Major scoops it out.
And Tyler will take a three…

343
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,987
- Oh, another brick.
- Damn!

344
00:24:08,112 --> 00:24:10,531
That's another disappointing
shocker, as the Huskies

345
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:14,034
just cannot win without their big star.

346
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:17,204
Kenny. Kenny. Just a few questions.

347
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:21,876
First your father has a heart attack
and then your brother…

348
00:24:51,405 --> 00:24:54,116
It wasn't supposed to be like this, kid.

349
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,370
First Pop.

350
00:25:00,122 --> 00:25:01,707
Now you.

351
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:06,086
Our whole life.
Before school, after school,

352
00:25:06,212 --> 00:25:09,131
at night when it was too dark to see…

353
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:12,843
all we wanted to do
was play basketball.

354
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,638
Win that championship, baby.

355
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:19,683
A and K, all…

356
00:25:29,068 --> 00:25:31,570
What am I supposed to do now, man?

357
00:25:34,073 --> 00:25:36,867
I can't do this alone, Antoine.

358
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:40,871
I need you, kid.

359
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,915
- Hi.
- Come on, man. No interviews.

360
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,418
- I'm not here to…
- I'm tired of talking to reporters.

361
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:29,753
- I'm not a reporter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

362
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,381
I mean, not right this minute.

363
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,633
What?

364
00:26:34,758 --> 00:26:38,179
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry
about what happened to your brother.

365
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:42,474
- I can't imagine.
- Thank you. But I'm fine, really.

366
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,896
To be honest with you, I'm really tired
of all the sympathy, you know?

367
00:26:47,021 --> 00:26:51,901
So this was a bad idea? OK, I got it.
I'll just leave. Forget it.

368
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:55,279
No, wait. Wait. RC, wait!

369
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:58,157
It's not you. I'm just not used
to all this attention.

370
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:00,826
I got all these people calling me,
asking me questions.

371
00:27:00,951 --> 00:27:04,872
ESPN, Time magazine…
Sticking all these cameras in my face.

372
00:27:04,997 --> 00:27:09,043
- All this just cos my brother dies?
- I know, it's been awful.

373
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:12,296
Umbrella?

374
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:17,801
- Thank you.
- If you just wanna talk, you know…

375
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,387
- Thank you very much.
- If you need someone to talk to…

376
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,724
Look, I ain't gonna thank you again.
All right. I'm joking.

377
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:25,643
- Come on!
- Watch your man, Zigi!

378
00:27:25,768 --> 00:27:29,021
Come on. All right. Watch the back pick!

379
00:27:29,146 --> 00:27:32,775
Kenny, set the offence!
Come on, you guys. Kenny, come on!

380
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,485
- Luther, move it.
- Dammit!

381
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,863
What is that? What is that?
Come on, Kenny.

382
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:39,740
I am!

383
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:42,826
Let's go. Come on, run the double fist.

384
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,914
Luther, I can't run that play if you can't
get open. Move it, Luther! Move it!

385
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,292
- Kenny!
- Hold it, hold it. Stop.

386
00:27:50,417 --> 00:27:53,087
Give me the ball.

387
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,634
Luther, my wife's got a plastic
Jesus on her dashboard

388
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,053
- moves better than you do.
- Luther!

389
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:04,223
Listen, boys. We don't win this
next game, it's sayonara season.

390
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:09,478
It's no NCAA. It's no nothing.
What do you say, Coach?

391
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:12,273
I say we go out there and win.

392
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:16,694
All right, feed on that enthusiasm.
Set the offence.

393
00:28:17,945 --> 00:28:19,822
Offence, come on, let's go.

394
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:24,201
Give 'em the ball.

395
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,162
- Come on!
- Here we go.

396
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,373
- Come on.
- Let's go, Dawgs.

397
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:31,292
- One to one.
- Come on, let's go.

398
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:34,962
- Kenny! Kenny!
- Big man for the three!

399
00:28:35,838 --> 00:28:39,884
Hold it, hold it. Hold it a second!
Zigi, what the hell are you thinking?

400
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,886
- Well…
- You never shoot the three.

401
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:45,264
You hear me?
You never shoot the three!

402
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,351
Everybody, I…

403
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,816
- Hit the showers.
- All right. Go hit the showers. Take it in.

404
00:28:55,941 --> 00:28:58,485
Malik, three-point line in America
longer than in Serbia.

405
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,947
Shut up, you seven-foot Tweety.

406
00:29:02,072 --> 00:29:06,118
Shit, man. Damn!

407
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,088
Coach?

408
00:29:18,881 --> 00:29:20,966
Hey, Coach?

409
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,552
Coach!

410
00:29:23,677 --> 00:29:25,971
The ball, it's gone!

411
00:29:26,096 --> 00:29:28,849
It disappeared! Coach!

412
00:29:53,499 --> 00:29:58,003
- Hm. How you doing?
- How you doing?

413
00:29:58,128 --> 00:30:00,047
- I'm fine. I'm chillin'.
- Really?

414
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:02,591
- Yeah.
- Cos I'm worried about you.

415
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,512
Coach, I'm a big boy.
You ain't gotta worry about me.

416
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,264
Well, I do.

417
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:11,976
You've been hit pretty hard lately.
I don't want to add to your problems.

418
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:16,981
But Coach Nichols thinks I should
start Jimmy at the point tomorrow.

419
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:20,359
I'd ignore him, but it's the first
original idea he's had in five seasons,

420
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:23,404
so I'm trying it on for size.

421
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:25,573
What do you think?

422
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:30,619
- You're the Coach, right?
- Yes, I am.

423
00:30:31,787 --> 00:30:33,747
Jimmy can't set the pick or go to his left.

424
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:38,711
I mean, he couldn't carry this team
with a forklift. Kenny, you're my guy now.

425
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,714
I gotta know you're ready
to step up to the plate.

426
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:45,801
Yesterday was the worst practice
I've seen from any team I've coached.

427
00:30:45,926 --> 00:30:48,429
And you didn't say a word.
Now why is that?

428
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:51,849
- Coach, I'm not Antoine, man.
- I know who I'm talking to.

429
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:55,019
I need you to take charge of this team.
Now I need a general.

430
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,897
- That's not my game.
- I'm asking you to make it your game.

431
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,650
- But if it's not my game, you can't…
- I'm…

432
00:31:04,486 --> 00:31:08,782
Kenny, you know,
it was four years ago today

433
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:13,412
that your brother signed a letter of intent
to play basketball at UDub.

434
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:16,707
I remember that day. I opened
a ten-year-old bottle of Scotch,

435
00:31:16,832 --> 00:31:19,251
I went home for lunch,
I took a run at the wife…

436
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:21,962
- I don't wanna hear that.
- That was a great day.

437
00:31:22,087 --> 00:31:24,465
And the next year, we signed you
and I knew I had a team

438
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,719
that could take Washington to the
Final Four for the first time since '63.

439
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:34,058
And I'm not willing to say goodbye
to that dream, Kenny. Are you?

440
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,608
I gotta go, Coach. I got a two o'clock.

441
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,987
Hey, Kenny.

442
00:31:47,112 --> 00:31:50,157
You don't have to play
without your brother, you know.

443
00:31:50,282 --> 00:31:53,619
You got him. Right here.

444
00:32:01,168 --> 00:32:06,423
At the second half, the Cal Bears
lead the hapless Huskies, 43-31.

445
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:10,261
But the big story tonight:
The continuing poor play of Kenny Tyler

446
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,346
with no points on no attempts.

447
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:18,352
- Hey, health food. All right.
- Mikulski, you're not eating?

448
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:21,438
No, I can't eat any more
when I watch these guys.

449
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,566
They make me sick.

450
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:27,278
I feel like I'm wasting away.

451
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:30,489
OK, guys. Now we're down 12,
but we don't stink.

452
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,491
Now, that's an improvement, all right?

453
00:32:32,616 --> 00:32:35,953
OK, move 'em around on offence.
Move the basketball, OK?

454
00:32:36,078 --> 00:32:38,289
- Come on. Dawgs up here.
- OK, hands in.

455
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,125
- One, two, three.
- Go.

456
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,795
- Hey, Kenny. Kenny!
- Yeah?

457
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,381
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

458
00:32:47,506 --> 00:32:50,176
OK, listen. If you get open,
take the damn shot.

459
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,344
- All right.
- OK.

460
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:57,933
And if you're not open,
who are you gonna pass it to?

461
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,605
Ten-foot fadeaway
and that'll drop off the rim.

462
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,899
Tyler comes up with a rebound.
He'll bring it up.

463
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,444
Let's see if Tyler will finally
take a shot this time downcourt.

464
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:13,532
- Tyler stops, calls the play.
- Anything can happen.

465
00:33:13,657 --> 00:33:15,993
Tyler turns and…
We got a pass!

466
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:17,453
Nice pass.

467
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:22,333
Outside the three-point arc to O'Grady.
O'Grady for three!

468
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,212
- And the Huskies…
- Great pass! Great pass!

469
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,588
What the heck?

470
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:29,673
Cal bring it back up.
Tyler tries to run him down.

471
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:35,012
He'll dish it off to Byron. Byron, easy
ten-footer. Got it. Nope, he didn't.

472
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:37,890
It's in and out. What a heartbreak.

473
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:40,351
Tyler with a rebound over to O'Grady.

474
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,102
What kind of shot was that?

475
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,188
O'Grady across the timeline,
he puts the move on Faby.

476
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:47,399
Serves up the no-look pass,
and Major with a slam!

477
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:53,155
And it's Dawgs up! Well, well, well.
The Huskies are back. They're on fire.

478
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,408
That's five unanswered points by the
Huskies. They're back in the game.

479
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:57,701
Fill me in, Bernie.

480
00:33:57,826 --> 00:34:01,413
Eight seconds left in the game.
Huskies 72, Bears 73. Bears up by one.

481
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,708
- That makes the Huskies down by one.
- They in-bound the ball.

482
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,503
Cal in-bounds the ball.
Eight seconds and counting.

483
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:11,257
The Huskies need a turnover or they
can kiss the post-season goodbye.

484
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,802
Jackson… on the pass, over to Stevens.

485
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,096
Stevens, top of the key with five, four…

486
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,056
Open, open!

487
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:22,142
- And whoa! Hello!
- All the way, baby.

488
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:26,397
That ball came outta there
like a greased pig.

489
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,107
On the move now. Ahead to Tyler.

490
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,984
- Malik!
- A chest pass for Major.

491
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:33,863
And that ball loops up
to the basket and goes in!

492
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:40,911
Nice shot there. You see that? I'm telling
ya, Dawgs up, baby. Dawgs up!

493
00:34:41,036 --> 00:34:43,998
75-73! The Huskies win!

494
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:48,711
Kenny Tyler with a knuckleball
three-pointer from half-court!

495
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,881
This is one for the highlight reels!

496
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,800
This is one to remember!

497
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:57,469
Here comes a bonus right now.
Kenny Tyler, folks.

498
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,596
Kenny Tyler, wow!

499
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,640
18 points, nine assists,
and a wild and wacky second half there.

500
00:35:01,765 --> 00:35:04,476
The easy two would've sealed
the game. You went for the three.

501
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,271
Were you trying to send
the basketball world a message?

502
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:13,194
Not really. I was dribbling down-court
and I saw Malik cut to… cut to the hair.

503
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,070
I mean, to the hole and…

504
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,489
- Kenny?
- Well…

505
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:18,741
Kenny?

506
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,285
I'll see you at the Barking Dog.

507
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,704
Did you see me elbow that guy?

508
00:35:45,809 --> 00:35:48,479
Nice game.

509
00:35:51,857 --> 00:35:53,901
Hello?

510
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:58,906
Hey, Kenny. I'm right here.

511
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:01,575
Do you hear me?

512
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,538
Hello?

513
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,084
Come on, y'all. Stop playin'.

514
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:14,255
- Anybody there?
- I've been here for 20 years.

515
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,464
Stop playin', y'all.

516
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:18,342
All of a sudden,
you don't know my voice?

517
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,720
That's cold.

518
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,891
I don't hear anything.

519
00:36:26,016 --> 00:36:29,520
I might be having a nervous breakdown,
but I'm gonna be all right.

520
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:34,567
Go home and I'm gonna get me some
sleep. I'll be back on top in the morning.

521
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:38,279
I see you're gonna need
a little more convincing.

522
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:41,217
Come on, Kenny. Buggin', man.
Buggin'. Come on now.

523
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:45,471
Relax and get your shit together, Kenny.
Get your shit together.

524
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:50,851
This is all a dream. That's all.

525
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,646
I got you. I got you.

526
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,689
Kenny! Kenny, it's me!

527
00:37:55,814 --> 00:37:57,733
- Back up.
- Kenny?

528
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:00,319
Back up. I will smoke you. Back up…

529
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:05,032
- Kenny. Kenny, it's me.
- I told you to back up off of me.

530
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,744
God, would you wake up?

531
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,372
- Come here.
- Get off me!

532
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,707
- Listen to me.
- Get off me!

533
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:18,128
It's just like Pop said:
If you and I stick together…

534
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:22,216
anything… anything…

535
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,930
Anything…

536
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,935
..can happen.

537
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,104
Lock 'em up.

538
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,904
Antoine? It's you?

539
00:38:44,029 --> 00:38:47,616
Yes, it's really me, boy. Come on.

540
00:38:47,741 --> 00:38:52,288
Come on, I told you I was coming back.
I told you I was coming back.

541
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:55,541
Man.

542
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,335
- I can't believe it, man.
- You better believe it.

543
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,547
Oh, sh… Whoa.

544
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:06,677
It's a little too freaky.
I'm… I'm gonna take a seat.

545
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,805
I'm just gonna get me a seat.

546
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,893
Oh, wow. This is amazing, kid.

547
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,813
I don't believe it, man. Yo, wait till
I tell Mom. She's gonna be so happy.

548
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,982
- Kenny…
- Halloween'll be the bomb this year.

549
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:23,319
That's not the way it works.
You are the only one that can see me.

550
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:27,823
- Why?
- Because you called me.

551
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:32,703
- You said you needed me.
- This will take a lot of getting used to.

552
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:36,665
Well, get used to it fast, baby.
We got a trophy to get. All right?

553
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,417
- A and K?
- All the way.

554
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,670
- NC…
- Two A, baby!

555
00:39:41,795 --> 00:39:43,339
Yeah!

556
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,133
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

557
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,762
- It's good to have my little brother back.
- It's good to have my big brother back.

558
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:55,309
Oh, man. My man, Antoine.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

559
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:59,063
Oh, kid. It's is so good to see you.

560
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,439
Tell me something I don't know.

561
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,608
Folks, as the Huskies
take the floor today,

562
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,444
they face Washington State
in a must-win situation.

563
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,530
- Right.
- To clinch third place in the Pac-10

564
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,950
and the wild-card berth
in the NCAA tourney.

565
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:14,703
Tonight is huge, it's big, it's humongous.
It's Marlon Brando, I'll tell ya.

566
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:17,039
It won't be easy, because
when the Cougars come here

567
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,834
- to the Dawg House, they come to play.
- Who doesn't, Ernie?

568
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,294
Unless the Huskies
have lady luck on their side,

569
00:40:22,419 --> 00:40:24,964
it's liable to be the end
of another long, disappointing season.

570
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,882
- Long, disappointing season.
- Sure is.

571
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,260
- Here we go. Let's huddle.
- All right. Let's go.

572
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,719
- Bring it in.
- Hustle up!

573
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,055
OK. OK, guys, here we go.

574
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,599
Now remember, we just
gotta play our game, OK?

575
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,434
Don't let them dictate the tempo.

576
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,604
All we gotta do is put the biscuit
in the basket, the noodles in the soup,

577
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,566
the cookies in the milk, the beef in the…

578
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:47,319
You said you wanted me to be
a little bit more verbal, Coach.

579
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,445
And when we get a lead…

580
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,824
Hey, Kenny. If we win this one,
we go to the tournament.

581
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,617
- You nervous, kid?
- Hell, no.

582
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,620
Kenny, you got a problem
with running the press?

583
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,665
Oh, no, Coach, I was just talk…

584
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,253
Kenny, look at this. Look at this. Huh?

585
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,300
Kenny, look, I'm all thumbs. Watch. Oh!

586
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,343
OK. Now I want…

587
00:41:11,468 --> 00:41:14,388
We're gonna win this
with defense and rebounds.

588
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,391
- Stop it.
- I want you to watch out for… Preston.

589
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,310
- Watch this.
- Stop it.

590
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,312
Hey, cutie-pie.

591
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,818
Oh, shit!

592
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,578
- Kenny, what are you doing?
- Huh?

593
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:42,416
I got something in my throat, Coach.
Excuse me.

594
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,923
Keep Preston off the boards.

595
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:51,050
Water.

596
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,186
Oh, I am so sorry.

597
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,648
Oh, I… Thank you.
I feel so much better now.

598
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,192
Let me help you with that.

599
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,528
Yeah, yeah. All right, great.

600
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,696
Somebody get him a towel.
That was funny.

601
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,448
What's the matter with you?

602
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,660
The start of the second half,
and the Washington Cougars, 37,

603
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:19,662
UDub Huskies, 34.

604
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,997
- A three-point differential.
- That's what it is.

605
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,167
LaSalle with the rebound
and over to Tyler.

606
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,586
- Tyler will bring it up.
- Hit Lik. Hit Lik.

607
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,756
Tyler shoots it ahead
to Major on the wing…

608
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:31,966
Bring it, baby.

609
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:36,804
Gonna work the baseline. He's forced
out of bounds. No, he's back in bounds.

610
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,016
And a slam! Wow!
Somebody check his feet for jet packs!

611
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:43,853
Peter Pan's in the house
and he's coming home for Christmas!

612
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,188
- Here he goes and he's up…
- Oh, yowza!

613
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,190
Oh! Did you see him fly?

614
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,651
I'm telling you,
the video camera does not lie!

615
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,779
- That was like Clyde Drexler.
- Dr J. Where you going on that?

616
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,905
Michael Jordan.

617
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,950
Major all over Preston.
Preston rolls inside.

618
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:03,581
Hrbacek steps up to try to take the
charge. Train wreck. That's a foul.

619
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:08,627
That's a… wait a minute.
No, a charge is called. Hello, Hrbacek!

620
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,673
The Serb takes the charge and comes
up standing like a seven-foot statue.

621
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,050
Preston outside for the three.
It looks good.

622
00:43:15,176 --> 00:43:16,927
No, it's out. Try to tip it in.

623
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:20,097
No, not again.
It looks like a popcorn popper up there.

624
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:23,851
- Too much English on that ball.
- It's got French, Spanish and Swahili.

625
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,854
- There's 15 seconds left to the game.
- The Huskies are up by one.

626
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:30,399
Washington has the ball. Huskies have
to keep the Cougars from scoring.

627
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,736
Tyler on Davidson now
as he brings it up.

628
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,614
Listen. Don't blow it.
That boy gonna go left.

629
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,199
Davidson fakes left, goes right

630
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:41,160
and leaves Tyler faked.
He drives in for an easy slam.

631
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:45,164
- I thought you said he was going left.
- He went to our left.

632
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,290
Hey, what? What?

633
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:49,543
And Coach Pederson's gonna
call a time-out to regroup.

634
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,463
- I thought you said he was going left.
- He mostly does.

635
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,674
- What you mean "mostly"?
- I'm a ghost, not a psychic, all right?

636
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:59,637
- Oh, shut up!
- Hey, hey, hey, you better watch it.

637
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,639
- Stop that.
- I'll call Ghostbusters on your ass.

638
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,057
You better call somebody.

639
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,435
- What is Kenny…?
- Huh?

640
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:11,023
Seven seconds to go. The Huskies' ball
as Coach Pederson draws up the play.

641
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:14,276
You're gonna take the ball out.
Zigi, you set the screen here for…

642
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:18,030
Go! Go!

643
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,699
Go!

644
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,744
Tyler'll step up
to make the in-bound pass.

645
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:26,247
Throw it in. I'll do the rest.
Alley-oop at the basket.

646
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,583
Tyler with the in-bound
to a breaking O'Grady.

647
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,919
Quick pass, LaSalle.

648
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,587
I got it, I got it, I got it.

649
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,215
LaSalle, behind-the-back snow cone.

650
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:41,095
Now with a one-hand
touch pass to Hrbacek.

651
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,933
Between the legs of Preston.

652
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,143
Major steps up,
lofts one over his shoulder.

653
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:52,523
Kenny Tyler for the alley-oop.
It's gonna be close! Tyler…

654
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:58,487
And he slams it home
as the clock runs out. What a win!

655
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:02,992
The Huskies win 71 to 70. Huskies win.

656
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,536
- What a game!
- Where are we going?

657
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,413
- To the big dance!
- To the big show!

658
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,332
The big show in the sky!

659
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,668
Thank you.

660
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,972
That was beautiful.

661
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:28,225
Kenny. Kenny.
Kenny, not your game, huh?

662
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,060
- Hey.
- Great finish.

663
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:33,105
Hey, thank you. You the man, Coach.
You the man, baby.

664
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,610
Yeah! English!

665
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:42,031
Come on, man. You scared me.
You can't be doing that.

666
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,742
Whoo! Tourney time, boy!

667
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,872
We finally did it, kid.
We finally did it. We did it.

668
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,891
We did it, kid. We did it.

669
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,779
I bet you all wondering
what I'm doing, huh?

670
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:26,617
- Personally, I'm curious.
- Well, um… Um…

671
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:34,124
- The floor's all yours, baby.
- I was just giving myself a hug. See?

672
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,919
Loving me. You know why?

673
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,338
It's because I think that, you know,

674
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:43,133
I feel really good about all that
we accomplished here today,

675
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:47,137
and I think we should take
a moment and reflect,

676
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:50,307
and then give ourselves a big hug.

677
00:46:50,432 --> 00:46:52,977
Yes, give yourself a hug.

678
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:55,437
Yes, give yourself a hug.

679
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:59,066
Wow. Doesn't that feel good? Zigi?

680
00:47:03,863 --> 00:47:06,031
- What's up with Kenny, man?
- He's just sad.

681
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,743
What do you mean, he's sad?
Sad… He is nuts.

682
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,580
We have to have a talk.
I'm not losing any tournament over him.

683
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:14,748
- Let's go.
- No, he's crazy, man.

684
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,869
- Hi.
- Hi.

685
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,455
Um, anybody sitting there?

686
00:47:55,873 --> 00:48:01,212
- No, just that invisible man there.
- Oh. OK.

687
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:07,343
Kenny? Sit down. He just went to class,
so you can sit now.

688
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:13,224
Come on, sit. Sit, sit, sit.

689
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:18,979
Damn invisible people
just keep popping up, you know.

690
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,527
So…

691
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:31,450
I was like, you know,
wondering if maybe…

692
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,578
me and you… you know…

693
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,081
- Like, me and you, right?
- Me and you…

694
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:41,001
Like, together? Be… Damn… Um…

695
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:44,755
If maybe, like, me and you could, like…

696
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,550
- Go out?
- Yeah?

697
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,261
Yeah, why not?

698
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,597
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

699
00:48:56,058 --> 00:49:00,145
You must be proud.
The team's been kicking ass.

700
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,148
Oh, yeah. We've been really
hot lately, you know.

701
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:06,360
No, you've been more than hot. It's been
weird. You know what I'm saying?

702
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,405
Shots dropping in, hitting nothing
but net from no-business angles,

703
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:11,949
guys skying with six-second hang-time…

704
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:16,287
Hey, well, you know, that's just
the great thing about the game.

705
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:19,832
It's like on any given night,
anything can happen.

706
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,043
Maybe.

707
00:49:25,045 --> 00:49:27,798
Damn, where you been, boy?
I've been trying to find you all day.

708
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,134
- Would you stop that?
- Stop what?

709
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:33,888
Stop… looking so good
with your bad self.

710
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,016
Hey, man. This water's freezing.
My nipples is getting hard.

711
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:40,019
Don't nobody wanna hear
about your perky nipples.

712
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:43,564
Kenny, have you thought
about seeing someone?

713
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:50,529
RC, trust me.
I'm seeing plenty right about now.

714
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:54,700
- Uh-huh.
- Would you… excuse me, please?

715
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,035
Kenny…

716
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,842
Do me a favor. Take some advice
from your dead big brother.

717
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:14,762
- What's that?
- Keep this girl at a distance, man.

718
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,180
- Why?
- Trust me.

719
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:19,850
Because right now, you're a hot story.
She's a reporter.

720
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:24,146
If she breaks this story, you are the new
nut on the cover of National Enquirer.

721
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,525
Hey, look, the girl ain't like that.
Hey, come on, baby. Relax.

722
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:32,738
Relate. Release, baby. All right?
Don't be jealous just cos your prospects

723
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,533
look like all the chicks
in the "Thriller" video.

724
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:37,910
- You think that's funny?
- Necrophiliac.

725
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,746
You remember how I used
to whoop your ass when we was kids?

726
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,083
- Don't mess with a dead man.
- What? I ain't scared of nobody. What?

727
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:47,586
What? What you saying, boy?
What? What? What?

728
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,631
Wha… OK.

729
00:50:55,094 --> 00:50:57,304
One, two, three…

730
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,434
Get off me! Get off me.
Don't make me hurt you.

731
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:09,066
Remember I used to put you
in the dofey?

732
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,902
- No. No, not the dofey!
- It's dofey time.

733
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,238
Get off me. Get off me.

734
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,327
- Not the chicken wing!
- Chicken wing?

735
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:21,912
No.

736
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:26,292
All right, you got me. OK. All right, OK.

737
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,256
All right, yeah.
How you like that, Space Ghost, huh?

738
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:34,967
Hey, hey! Hey!

739
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:41,056
I hate… you!

740
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:49,523
- All right!
- Get it up, boy.

741
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,108
You can't deal with me.

742
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,985
Come on, Mohammed Ugly.
Come on, baby.

743
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,417
Nipples!

744
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:20,554
- Kenny!
- Hey, guys. Ow. OK. Ow, ow, ow.

745
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,682
Me and the guys, we want to know…
What's up with you, man?

746
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:27,561
Nothing. I'm just loosening up.

747
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:29,772
Doing a little bit of kung chi.

748
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:32,399
- Kung chi?
- What the hell does kung chi mean?

749
00:52:32,525 --> 00:52:35,402
- Yeah, what the hell does it mean?
- Kung chi.

750
00:52:35,528 --> 00:52:37,947
- You know, kung chi, kung chi.
- Huh?

751
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:40,282
It's an ancient oriental art form
of loosening up.

752
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:42,368
All the sumo wrestlers do it.

753
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,663
See, that's how they fit their big ass
in them little diapers.

754
00:52:45,788 --> 00:52:51,794
But for real, guys, I'm fine. I'm fine.
See, fine? Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine.

755
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,462
You're buggin', man.

756
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,798
Either you talk to us
or we're gonna talk to Coach.

757
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:58,342
Coach don't say nothing
to you other than sit down.

758
00:52:58,467 --> 00:53:01,971
Would you shut up?
Listen, guys, wait, wait, listen.

759
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:05,808
It's Antoine.

760
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:11,188
Kenny… Big A is dead. He's gone.
You're gonna have to face it.

761
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:14,108
- Not necessarily.
- Don't do it.

762
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,902
He's back and he's right here, see?
Look at him, guys.

763
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:19,029
- He's back.
- You need some serious help.

764
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,073
- It's worse than I thought.
- You need help.

765
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:23,284
Come on, Antoine!
You gotta tell 'em, man.

766
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,870
I can't tell 'em.
This only works if I keep a low profile.

767
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:30,499
Negro, you invisible! How much more
of a low profile you gonna get?

768
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,793
- Who's he talking to?
- Let me slap him. Just once.

769
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,212
- No, come here.
- Let me slap him. He'll snap out of it.

770
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,423
Just grab him. Ready? Grab him.

771
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,134
- Come on, guys. Wait, wait, wait.
- Grab him tight!

772
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:43,345
Hey, man, I'm hungry. I'm going
to get some Chinese food. Bye-bye.

773
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:46,348
Ant, you gotta do something!
Please do something, man. Please!

774
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,809
- I can't hear you. I gotta go.
- You gotta show 'em!

775
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,688
You the only one that can see me.

776
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:56,442
Antoine, Antoine, please. I'll never ask
you for anything again in my life.

777
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:59,695
Please, Antoine. Just show 'em, man.
Show 'em I'm not crazy, please?

778
00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:02,239
All right. I'll do it.

779
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:07,328
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm gonna prove it to you.

780
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,831
- Danny Partridge.
- What?

781
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,666
Dunk it.

782
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,877
- Bite me.
- Just do it.

783
00:54:15,002 --> 00:54:18,881
Kenny, he cannot possibly do it.
He's just too small.

784
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:22,134
Man, who are you?
Seven foot and can't touch the rim.

785
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,637
- At least I'm seven foot.
- Antoine's gonna make him do it.

786
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,514
Oh, boy, here we go again.

787
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,142
Danny misses the dunk, we take you
to the coach and get you some help.

788
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,353
- OK. All right.
- This is stupid.

789
00:54:32,478 --> 00:54:34,021
- Go!
- Will you just do it?

790
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,191
- All right.
- Come on, let's go.

791
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:39,860
- Quit being scared. Just do it.
- Come on, white man, jump!

792
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:43,614
Do you know how stupid this is?
This is stupid. Man, look at me.

793
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,575
Do it.

794
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,411
- All right.
- Come on, Opie, dunk it.

795
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:54,625
Goddamn! Holy shit!

796
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,928
See? Now do you believe me?

797
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:10,307
Oh, he-he-he's just, um,
pumped for the tourney, that's all.

798
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,435
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, this guy…

799
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,479
Oh, tough crowd.

800
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:19,692
Well, um, I have-I have been
working out a lot lately.

801
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:26,365
Wait, hey, hey, hey, hey…

802
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,202
See? See, now you done pissed him off.

803
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,327
Oh, my God!

804
00:56:18,501 --> 00:56:20,753
- Oh, geez.
- I don't believe it.

805
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:21,921
I don't believe it.

806
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:26,342
- You better believe it, baby.
- Nice touch, baby.

807
00:56:27,927 --> 00:56:30,721
Welcome back.

808
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:35,392
Welcome to the San Francisco Bay Area

809
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:38,771
and the sights and sounds
of the NCAA West Regional.

810
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,856
From the Oakland Memorial Coliseum,

811
00:56:40,981 --> 00:56:42,733
it's the University
of Washington Huskies

812
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,944
against the Bulldogs of Fresno State.

813
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:48,072
First though, we got a chance
to watch Harry the Husky

814
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:50,950
as he'll perform his patented
slam-a-jam-a dunk.

815
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,285
Looks like he's carrying a load.

816
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:58,749
And the stat sheet says he is, um,
0 for 15 in the season so far.

817
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,918
Come on. Here we go.

818
00:57:01,043 --> 00:57:03,712
And here he is, all set.

819
00:57:03,796 --> 00:57:06,674
He's up.

820
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,760
- I hope that dog was wearing a cup.
- Yes, definitely.

821
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:15,391
Slight miscalculation.
Go, Dawgs. Huskies!

822
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,935
There's nothing like
the NCAA tournament.

823
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:20,187
It's the most special, unbelievable event.

824
00:57:20,312 --> 00:57:23,357
The pageantry, the excitement.
I think it'll be awesome, baby.

825
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:27,319
It wasn't too awesome for the Huskies
in their match-up with Fresno State.

826
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,738
Coaches Pederson
and Tarkanian are really ready.

827
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:32,616
But Tarkanian put the hurt on him
bigtime during the regular season.

828
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:35,911
Blew 'em out by 20 points.
It was an M & M'er, a mismatch.

829
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,206
They're loaded. They can shoot
the trifecta. They got diaper dandies.

830
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:42,084
They got prime-time players.
They're awesome.

831
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:46,297
Pederson better have his club ready
or it'll be Embarrassing City, baby.

832
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,634
So you really like musicals a lot, huh?

833
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:54,096
Oh, you know, when the
showboat appeared, it was magic.

834
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,599
- Hey, St John, how ya doing?
- Great.

835
00:57:57,433 --> 00:57:59,685
See you got all dressed up
for the tournament.

836
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:04,315
You like that? I like to look nice.
Hey, Gertz, why don't you take a stroll?

837
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,986
Get yourself a complimentary hot dog.
I'm gonna talk to our friend here, OK?

838
00:58:09,111 --> 00:58:11,197
- What for?
- I'm shy.

839
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:16,160
What do you care? Just go do it.
Today. While we're young.

840
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,793
- So.
- So…

841
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:27,087
You and Kenny are pretty close, huh?

842
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,966
- We've talked a few times.
- Yeah.

843
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,887
- But that doesn't mean that…
- No, no, no. Hey. Relax, relax.

844
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:38,307
I know you're both adults,
and what you guys do during recess

845
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,101
is no business of mine.

846
00:58:42,728 --> 00:58:46,649
Anyway, the thing is, there's
something going on with this team.

847
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:49,068
I have a feeling Kenny's
got something to do with it.

848
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,237
Hm. What are you
getting at, Mikulski?

849
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:55,616
What I'm getting at is something
you ain't got: a break.

850
00:58:56,325 --> 00:58:59,745
Now if there's a story here
and you drop the dime,

851
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:03,165
you know, it could be the cover
of Sporting News.

852
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:12,341
- What do I have to do?
- Whatever it takes to get the story.

853
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:15,511
Grab yourself a cold one
and hold on to the armrest, folks,

854
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:19,598
cos it's game time. So the Huskies
and the Bulldogs set to square off.

855
00:59:19,723 --> 00:59:22,893
And Hrbacek will tip off
against O'Neil of Fresno State.

856
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:26,522
O'Neil, you recall, earlier in the regular
season involved in an altercation

857
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:28,941
with Kenny Tyler that resulted
in Tyler's ejection.

858
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,069
Up, and controlled by Hrbacek
over to Tyler.

859
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,864
He'll bring it up, guarded by Seymor.

860
00:59:34,989 --> 00:59:39,201
- Hey, hey. Start it off right.
- Come on, get a life. Leave me alone.

861
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,454
- Let's go to Zigi for a three-pointer.
- Zigi can't shoot no three-pointer.

862
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,166
- Hey, just do what I say, Kenny.
- Zig.

863
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:49,920
Tyler, the dish to Hrbacek
way outside the three-point line.

864
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:52,506
He's 0 for 12 outside
the arc this season.

865
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,676
- Zigi, what the hell are you…?
- Do it, Zigi.

866
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:59,471
- Zigi for three… He got it!
- I can't believe it! Zigi goes downtown!

867
00:59:59,597 --> 01:00:00,973
Nice shot.

868
01:00:04,977 --> 01:00:08,105
This Serb is going long-distance.
Somebody call MCI.

869
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:09,815
I mean, he deserves a discount.

870
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:11,859
- You've been working with him?
- I, uh…

871
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,486
- Good work, Coach.
- Thanks.

872
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:17,364
Peabody brings it up,
guarded by O'Grady.

873
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:19,533
Tark will call the play.

874
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,161
Peabody over to Seymor.
Seymor, O'Neil.

875
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:26,540
And a drive and a slam over Zigi.
And the foul. And now tempers flare.

876
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,542
Malik, he better watch it. He'll get a T.

877
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,337
Tyler now steps in to try
to calm things down,

878
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:34,048
and there's no love lost
between those two.

879
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:37,176
Better be careful. Big brother ain't here
to protect your ass no more.

880
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,136
- What?
- Come on, bring it, little girl.

881
01:00:39,261 --> 01:00:40,638
- That's bullshit!
- Excuse me?

882
01:00:40,763 --> 01:00:42,181
I should head-butt you like Rodman.

883
01:00:42,306 --> 01:00:43,849
- What's that?
- All right, easy.

884
01:00:43,974 --> 01:00:46,352
O'Neil, known for his bad-boy ways.

885
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:48,812
A regular Dennis Rodman in the making,

886
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:52,608
but tonight he's more like Dennis
the Menace, out there looking for trouble.

887
01:00:52,733 --> 01:00:54,985
- Pour it in now, pour it in.
- Hey.

888
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:00,491
- Whoo! Ooh!
- Shoot!

889
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:05,120
Drops back like a quarterback and
he rifles a line drive off the backboard…

890
01:01:05,246 --> 01:01:10,417
Whoa. This ball is sailing,
sailing into the rafters.

891
01:01:10,543 --> 01:01:13,963
Somebody call 911.
This boy needs a doctor.

892
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:18,467
Oh, yeah. That happens
on this planet all the time.

893
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:21,345
What the hell are you doing?
Keep your head in the game.

894
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:24,223
O'Neil left to ponder whether
he should've been trying out…

895
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:27,685
- The ball… It went up…
- What?

896
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:32,398
Huskies by nine now,
as we wind down here in the first half.

897
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:36,151
Seymor brings it up, guarded by Major.

898
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:40,447
O'Neil pushes Tyler.
That looks like a foul.

899
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:43,367
And Seymor dishes
to O'Neil on the wing.

900
01:01:46,245 --> 01:01:49,456
You better leave my brother the hell
alone! And get your thumb outta my eye!

901
01:01:49,582 --> 01:01:52,168
And O'Neil turns it over on purpose.

902
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,086
This boy has flipped his lid.

903
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:58,090
Somebody call Bellevue
and see if there's a vacancy.

904
01:01:58,215 --> 01:01:59,216
Time-out.

905
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:03,637
So a major upset. 76-61. Dick, you
and I have seen a lot of strange games.

906
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:06,432
- This one was wild.
- I can't believe it. I mean, I'm stunned.

907
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:08,058
Tarkanian's gonna be shocked.

908
01:02:08,184 --> 01:02:12,521
Look at the stats, Brad.
36 by Kenny Tyler. He was super.

909
01:02:12,646 --> 01:02:17,109
I mean, he was a PTP'er. Pederson
is on cloud nine. Tarkanian's crying.

910
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:21,572
They wield some unbelievable
canine magic today, the Huskies.

911
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:22,990
- Whoo!
- All right.

912
01:02:23,115 --> 01:02:25,868
- That's it, baby. Give me some!
- Chill. Chill.

913
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,329
That's the way we do it, boy.
A and K all the way.

914
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:31,165
- You know it, baby.
- Why don't we celebrate? Get grub.

915
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:34,585
Or better yet, let's go to the cemetery,
see if I can get laid. I need some action.

916
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:39,507
You know what? That sounds great,
but I think I'm gonna be busy tonight, bro.

917
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:43,594
Oh, come on. Hey, Kenny, man.
Will you stop…?

918
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:09,703
- We'll play that basketball.
- Yeah!

919
01:03:16,502 --> 01:03:19,213
Oh, no, I couldn't. I couldn't. All right.

920
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:24,677
Go, Coach! Go, Coach!
Go, Coach! Go, Coach!

921
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:29,932
Nichols, get in here.

922
01:03:43,112 --> 01:03:46,532
- We're going to the tournament!
- Yeah!

923
01:03:46,657 --> 01:03:50,369
One time, right,
my mom was being thrifty,

924
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:53,372
and she went to Kmart
and bought us these cheap-ass shoes.

925
01:03:53,497 --> 01:03:56,458
- Stop.
- I couldn't tell the left from the right.

926
01:03:56,584 --> 01:04:01,255
They were like some
ambidextrous shoes. It was hilarious.

927
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:07,720
Oh, man. Oh, God. Antoine.
That's my man.

928
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,930
- So…
- So.

929
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:13,058
- We were talking about the game.
- Right.

930
01:04:13,184 --> 01:04:15,561
Have you been doing anything special?
Wearing lucky socks?

931
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:17,730
Carrying a rabbit's foot?

932
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:22,276
Taking anything?

933
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,995
What do you mean, taking anything?

934
01:04:34,413 --> 01:04:38,209
I've just never seen
a team play like this before, it's…

935
01:04:42,588 --> 01:04:45,174
So we gotta be on something?

936
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:49,261
No. I didn't mean for it
to pop out like that.

937
01:04:50,054 --> 01:04:51,388
There it is. That's her headline.

938
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:53,390
"Huskies Shooting Up",
"Dawgs on Dope".

939
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:55,559
- Shut up.
- You're the only one that can hear me.

940
01:04:55,684 --> 01:04:58,229
So hear me, Kenny. Kenny. Move.

941
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:05,319
- So what are you trying to say?
- I'm just, um…

942
01:05:08,489 --> 01:05:10,282
She babbling. She's stuttering.

943
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:13,869
- Why are we talking like this?
- She ain't giving you no ass.

944
01:05:13,994 --> 01:05:16,372
- No reason.
- Stop that corny smile.

945
01:05:16,497 --> 01:05:19,834
- It's just that you look so b…
- Stop that. Don't get corny.

946
01:05:19,959 --> 01:05:21,627
..beautiful from this angle.

947
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:25,130
Oh, you ain't gotta work that hard.
You ain't getting no ass.

948
01:05:25,256 --> 01:05:28,592
- Excuse me. Gotta go to the bathroom.
- There is no rhythm.

949
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:31,262
Look, we've been through a lot together,

950
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:34,098
and I love you more
than anything in this world,

951
01:05:34,223 --> 01:05:38,894
but you gotta stop popping up
all the time wanting to play.

952
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:42,815
I'm on a date.
I can't play with you right now.

953
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:48,779
Gosh. Why are you making it so hard?
People are starting to stare at me.

954
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:51,699
- You know something?
- Hey!

955
01:05:52,825 --> 01:05:55,244
I have the same problem.

956
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:58,622
Trust me. My problem's
a lot bigger than yours.

957
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,502
Yeah.

958
01:06:04,503 --> 01:06:07,715
Oh, no, wait, my man. I'm not talking
about… Not that kind of problem.

959
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,383
- That's not funny.
- You hurt him.

960
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:11,093
He thinks I'm talking to my piece.

961
01:06:11,218 --> 01:06:13,554
You was having a little conversation
with your piece.

962
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:16,807
- A little conversation piece.
- Conversation… OK.

963
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:19,852
When I'm locked up in Bellevue,
I'm blaming you, OK?

964
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,857
Great, the food is here.
I am starving.

965
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:28,152
Look, Kenny, I didn't mean
to accuse you of anything.

966
01:06:28,277 --> 01:06:30,946
Oh, girl, stop it. We cool.
Don't worry about it.

967
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,489
But there's been a lot of weird…

968
01:06:32,615 --> 01:06:37,036
Weird? Nah. I didn't notice anything
weird happening. You trippin'.

969
01:06:37,161 --> 01:06:39,205
It's not just for steak any more.

970
01:06:42,917 --> 01:06:46,212
Steak sauce. Mmm.

971
01:06:48,047 --> 01:06:52,927
- Steak sauce… Mmm, mmm, mmm.
- Yes. Yeah.

972
01:06:53,761 --> 01:06:56,263
I love me some steak sauce.

973
01:06:58,057 --> 01:07:00,726
On salmon?

974
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,688
Oh, yeah. It gives it that,
uh, nice, zesty, tangy flavor.

975
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:08,192
Oh, that's gonna be good. Enjoy.

976
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:16,951
- Mmm, mmm, mmm…
- Ooh. Gets you right back here, right?

977
01:07:17,076 --> 01:07:20,829
Gets you right back in the throat?

978
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:25,709
Need some water?
Need some water? Ooh.

979
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:31,298
Slow, slow, slow. Drink.

980
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,513
- Thirsty?
- Yeah.

981
01:07:37,638 --> 01:07:42,852
- Yes. Yes. Sexy.
- I'm sorry, I'm just so… so hungry.

982
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:49,900
Would you like some zesty salmon?
You sure?

983
01:07:53,612 --> 01:07:58,158
So, I had an interesting time tonight.

984
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:04,039
Well, I had a pretty
interesting time myself.

985
01:08:05,207 --> 01:08:07,251
That's me.

986
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:12,548
It's late.

987
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:24,643
No. No, no, no.

988
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:30,983
Put that thing back in your mouth.

989
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:37,114
Maybe, um, maybe we're
rushing things a little bit.

990
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:43,495
Yeah, maybe we're rushing things
a little bit. Maybe we are…

991
01:08:45,122 --> 01:08:46,874
- So embarrassing.
-…rushing things.

992
01:08:46,999 --> 01:08:49,418
Yeah.

993
01:08:50,169 --> 01:08:52,838
Now… take it easy.

994
01:09:00,346 --> 01:09:01,347
What was that?

995
01:09:01,472 --> 01:09:04,934
- It was stupid and embarrassing.
- I like to kiss on the move.

996
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:07,811
- Oh, really?
- It's freaky.

997
01:09:07,937 --> 01:09:10,773
Oh, OK. It takes some getting used to.

998
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:17,905
- OK, I think I better go.
- Oh, OK.

999
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:19,782
- Yeah. OK.
- All right.

1000
01:09:19,907 --> 01:09:22,618
All right. OK, yeah.

1001
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:24,703
- Bye.
- Bye.

1002
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,872
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

1003
01:09:26,997 --> 01:09:28,499
- Crybaby.
- Mind your business.

1004
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:31,043
- Mind your business.
- You have no right doing that.

1005
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,128
I don't wanna hear it.
I don't wanna hear it.

1006
01:09:33,254 --> 01:09:35,965
- Mind your business, man!
- You mind your business.

1007
01:09:36,090 --> 01:09:39,969
- Got no business telling me what to do.
- Kenny? Kenny, what's going on?

1008
01:09:40,094 --> 01:09:43,264
- Hey, Coach.
- Who are you talking to?

1009
01:09:43,389 --> 01:09:45,099
- Uh…
- Kenny.

1010
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:47,142
- He'll glue your ass to the bench.
- Shut up!

1011
01:09:47,268 --> 01:09:48,936
I'm your Coach.
Don't talk to me that way.

1012
01:09:49,061 --> 01:09:50,646
You shouldn't have called me back.

1013
01:09:50,771 --> 01:09:54,275
- Well, maybe I'm sorry I did.
- All right then. I accept your apology.

1014
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,026
- If you want me gone, I'm gone.
- Good.

1015
01:09:56,151 --> 01:09:58,988
Look. Look, Kenny, I'm not trying
to come down on you here.

1016
01:09:59,113 --> 01:10:01,532
- I'm just trying to help you here.
- Fuck it, I'm gone then!

1017
01:10:01,657 --> 01:10:03,492
- Good. Good.
- I'm gone!

1018
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:07,621
- Kenny?
- You gonna be sorry. You need me!

1019
01:10:07,746 --> 01:10:10,124
What you doing?
You ain't gonna catch shit in here!

1020
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,251
Stupid Frenchman. Get on my nerves.

1021
01:10:12,376 --> 01:10:16,463
Kenny? Just tell me
what's going on here.

1022
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:20,551
Trust me, Coach.
You wouldn't understand.

1023
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:29,643
Antoine?

1024
01:10:32,771 --> 01:10:35,441
Ant, I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

1025
01:10:37,568 --> 01:10:39,778
I didn't mean it, man.

1026
01:10:41,697 --> 01:10:43,741
You know that, right?

1027
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:52,791
I know you didn't mean it. Crybaby.

1028
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:05,971
Storm clouds continue
to brew from the Northwest.

1029
01:11:06,096 --> 01:11:08,557
What a story this has become
for the UW Huskies.

1030
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:11,810
Their little guy Danny O'Grady
elevates his game to a new level.

1031
01:11:11,936 --> 01:11:13,896
So does his team,
as Coach Pederson's squad

1032
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:16,815
upsets Dean Smith's
North Carolina Tar Heels,

1033
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:19,276
sends the Heels packing
back to Chapel Hill.

1034
01:11:19,401 --> 01:11:21,237
For the Huskies, it's on to the Sweet 16.

1035
01:11:21,362 --> 01:11:24,156
O'Grady brings it up
into the front court, and the dish…

1036
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:28,911
Zigi on the drive and the lay-in.
And Hrbacek's got 15.

1037
01:11:31,372 --> 01:11:33,541
Unbelievable!
A street brawl took place!

1038
01:11:33,666 --> 01:11:36,961
The Arkansas Razorbacks
cut themselves to shreds!

1039
01:11:37,086 --> 01:11:41,382
Three of their five starters were rejected
for fighting - with themselves!

1040
01:11:41,507 --> 01:11:42,883
How wacky can you get?

1041
01:11:43,008 --> 01:11:46,679
And their coach, Nolan Richardson,
he was sent to the showers, baby,

1042
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:50,266
allowing the UW Huskies
to march on to the great A.

1043
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:53,102
Husky hysteria's going wild.

1044
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:56,146
So the clock's stopped.
3:20 remaining in the ballgame.

1045
01:11:56,272 --> 01:11:59,692
70-63 the Huskies, Dick, and they're
clinging to that seven-point advantage.

1046
01:11:59,817 --> 01:12:01,318
Well, Tito gets a TO, baby.

1047
01:12:01,443 --> 01:12:03,904
Right now, it's Maalox-mashing
time for both coaches.

1048
01:12:04,029 --> 01:12:06,782
Tito's talking to his team, sayin'
"We gotta speed up the tempo."

1049
01:12:06,907 --> 01:12:09,243
Pederson says "We gotta
spread out and slow it down."

1050
01:12:09,368 --> 01:12:12,288
OK, now, Danny and Kenny,
you keep that ball on the perimeter, OK?

1051
01:12:12,413 --> 01:12:16,125
And, guys, use the clock. Use that clock,
all right? Come on, let's go.

1052
01:12:16,250 --> 01:12:18,502
Let's go. One, two, three…

1053
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,673
UDub Huskies' ball.

1054
01:12:22,798 --> 01:12:26,302
Let's look for Major now to be
the triggerman on the in-bound.

1055
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:28,596
Kirk will step up and force the press.

1056
01:12:28,721 --> 01:12:31,307
Wildcats in desperate
need of a turnover.

1057
01:12:31,432 --> 01:12:32,850
Major into O'Grady. And the little guy
will bring it up for the Dawgs.

1058
01:12:34,727 --> 01:12:38,397
And Marlowe covers him stride
for stride all the way up-court.

1059
01:12:38,522 --> 01:12:41,317
Four corners. Work the clock, guys.
Work it, work it!

1060
01:12:41,442 --> 01:12:45,738
O'Grady taking his time, working
that clock. Now crosscourt to Tyler.

1061
01:12:45,863 --> 01:12:48,240
- Throw an alley-oop to Luther.
- I can't. Coach said…

1062
01:12:48,365 --> 01:12:50,826
Coach, my ass. Just do what I said.
I'm running this team.

1063
01:12:50,951 --> 01:12:54,455
And look for Tyler now to try to run
a four-corner slow-down offence.

1064
01:12:54,580 --> 01:13:00,085
He looks inside, fakes and now
he'll toss an alley-oop to LaSalle.

1065
01:13:00,836 --> 01:13:03,964
But LaSalle steamrolls Kirk
in the process.

1066
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:09,678
And that is a foul. Charging call on Luther
LaSalle, Dick, and that's number five.

1067
01:13:09,803 --> 01:13:13,098
Wow. He's the big stork.
Goes to the sideline on a charge.

1068
01:13:13,224 --> 01:13:16,268
- Who they gonna put in?
- They'll have to go with Jimmy Stubbs.

1069
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:17,853
- Who?
- Jimmy Stubbs.

1070
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:20,898
- Jimmy who?
- Come on, move it, move it. Let's go!

1071
01:13:22,942 --> 01:13:25,444
- You call that using the clock?
- No, Coach, but…

1072
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:28,614
Four fouls, you let yourself get called
for a charge? Sit down!

1073
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:29,823
- Coach…
- Sit down!

1074
01:13:29,949 --> 01:13:31,033
- Sit down.
- Jimmy?

1075
01:13:31,158 --> 01:13:32,785
- Huh?
- You're going in.

1076
01:13:32,910 --> 01:13:33,911
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

1077
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:36,163
Thank you. You will not be disappointed.

1078
01:13:36,288 --> 01:13:39,750
Nichols, huh?
Always looking out for a brother.

1079
01:13:42,211 --> 01:13:43,629
Lu, I just wanna say I'm sorry…

1080
01:13:43,754 --> 01:13:47,883
Get off me! And tell your damn
brother to get off me, too!

1081
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:52,263
Whoo! Did you see that, boy?
Did you see me?

1082
01:13:52,388 --> 01:13:54,765
It was like old times.
Did you see how high I was, kid?

1083
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:57,643
Ant, I ain't in the mood, man.
Leave me alone, all right?

1084
01:13:57,768 --> 01:14:00,312
- What?
- You buggin'. You're going too far.

1085
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:06,110
I'm going to the Final Four, son.
I don't know where you going.

1086
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:11,615
Another Husky shocker.
90-71, a 19-point win over Kentucky.

1087
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:18,706
Excuse me. Kenny? Excuse me, baby.

1088
01:14:18,831 --> 01:14:22,668
Don't eat the cake till I get back. Kenny?

1089
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:25,838
Where you at, Murphy? Whoo!

1090
01:14:26,422 --> 01:14:30,217
- Nice shot.
- Hey. Hey, what's up, Ma?

1091
01:14:30,342 --> 01:14:33,637
Whoo… I remember when
you made that foul line.

1092
01:14:35,931 --> 01:14:38,184
I bought the paint.

1093
01:14:38,309 --> 01:14:42,188
You got sick of us drawing it
with your lipstick.

1094
01:14:42,313 --> 01:14:46,775
I, um… caught myself trying
to die a little with Antoine.

1095
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:51,155
- Oh, Mom.
- But… you wouldn't let me.

1096
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:56,535
I watch you out there…
alive and playing,

1097
01:14:56,660 --> 01:15:01,916
and, oh, God, it's…
almost like he's right there beside you.

1098
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:07,213
Honey, I don't know what's gonna
happen in New York and I don't care.

1099
01:15:07,338 --> 01:15:09,798
I just wanna say thank you, baby.

1100
01:15:10,758 --> 01:15:15,429
I just wish your daddy was here.
Ooh. He would be so proud of you.

1101
01:15:20,809 --> 01:15:22,937
- Who's your baby girl?
- You, Ma.

1102
01:15:23,062 --> 01:15:25,397
You better believe it.

1103
01:15:26,065 --> 01:15:27,858
Let's go inside. Uncle Jake's waiting.

1104
01:15:27,983 --> 01:15:29,610
- Oh, no, not Uncle Jake.
- Oh, yeah.

1105
01:15:29,735 --> 01:15:32,947
Ma, that man ain't got no teeth,
but always wants something to eat.

1106
01:15:33,781 --> 01:15:38,035
Look for Tyler now to try to run
a four-corner slow-down offence.

1107
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,371
He looks inside…

1108
01:15:42,748 --> 01:15:45,209
- Yeah?
- Never eat a pizza after a burrito. Man!

1109
01:15:45,334 --> 01:15:46,669
What do you want, Mikulski?

1110
01:15:46,794 --> 01:15:47,920
- Talk to him?
- Yeah.

1111
01:15:48,045 --> 01:15:51,507
- What did you find out?
- Look, there's nothing to find out.

1112
01:15:51,632 --> 01:15:54,301
Mikulski, I gotta get back to this,
so if you don't mind,

1113
01:15:54,426 --> 01:15:55,928
I'd like for you to just leave me…

1114
01:15:56,053 --> 01:16:00,057
- Hello? RC, are you there?
-…alone.

1115
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:03,102
I can't believe it. Listen to me…

1116
01:16:13,237 --> 01:16:16,365
LaSalle steamrolls Kirk in the process.

1117
01:16:23,873 --> 01:16:26,125
Luther, you didn't even…

1118
01:16:27,001 --> 01:16:29,795
You didn't even touch the ball.

1119
01:16:42,433 --> 01:16:44,560
Tell your…

1120
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:48,022
Tell your damn brother to get off me?

1121
01:17:03,913 --> 01:17:04,872
Yeah?

1122
01:17:06,373 --> 01:17:09,210
- Hey, what's up, Kenny?
- What's up, dog? What's poppin'?

1123
01:17:09,335 --> 01:17:13,214
Is it cool if we talk for a minute?
Is it cool I come in?

1124
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:14,798
Yeah, come on.

1125
01:17:14,924 --> 01:17:17,510
- Come on, y'all, damn!
- Stop pushing!

1126
01:17:17,635 --> 01:17:21,222
- When I said "we", I meant the team.
- Damn.

1127
01:17:21,347 --> 01:17:24,141
- Is he here? Is Antoine here?
- Yeah, he's in the shower.

1128
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:27,269
Dead people usually don't
take showers, Kenny.

1129
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:30,606
And how many dead people
do you know, Zigi?

1130
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:34,860
- Not too many.
- All right then.

1131
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:37,279
What's up?
What y'all wanna talk about?

1132
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:43,327
- Tell him. Come on.
- It's Antoine.

1133
01:17:43,452 --> 01:17:44,745
Yeah, what about him?

1134
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:49,625
We don't want to play with him
any more. I mean, it feels wrong.

1135
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:52,545
Yeah, just tell him to chill.
Maybe come sit on the bench with me.

1136
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:56,382
Look, personally, I'm averaging 18
points a game since he's come back,

1137
01:17:56,507 --> 01:17:58,551
so I really don't give a shit, all right?

1138
01:17:58,676 --> 01:18:03,931
Look, look, look, look, look. He's a ball
hog. He was when he was alive.

1139
01:18:04,056 --> 01:18:06,934
And no disrespect,
he's even worse as a dead man.

1140
01:18:10,771 --> 01:18:13,232
He didn't hear us, did he?

1141
01:18:22,908 --> 01:18:24,994
- I think it's him.
- Me, too.

1142
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:27,872
I still got that embalming fluid
in my ears. I can't get…

1143
01:18:27,997 --> 01:18:30,416
- Hi, Antoine.
- Calm down. Say it.

1144
01:18:30,541 --> 01:18:33,043
What's this? This looks like
some kind of lynch mob.

1145
01:18:33,169 --> 01:18:35,004
- Go ahead. Tell him.
- Huh?

1146
01:18:35,129 --> 01:18:36,714
- Just do it.
- You tell him, Luther.

1147
01:18:36,839 --> 01:18:39,008
Tell me what?
What are they talking about, Kenny?

1148
01:18:39,133 --> 01:18:41,969
I ain't telling him. You tell him, Jimmy.
It was your bright idea.

1149
01:18:42,094 --> 01:18:44,471
You're lying through
the space in your teeth.

1150
01:18:44,597 --> 01:18:49,059
- Talk to me, Kenny.
- They want you off the team, Ant.

1151
01:18:50,436 --> 01:18:53,772
Off the team? Me?
You want me off the team?!

1152
01:18:53,898 --> 01:18:59,028
Let me tell you something! You don't
tell me shit! You don't tell me shit!

1153
01:18:59,153 --> 01:19:01,572
- None of you!
- Antoine, chill!

1154
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:08,037
- Shut up!
- Uh-oh. I think we pissed him off.

1155
01:19:08,162 --> 01:19:12,082
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Look, it's nothing personal.

1156
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:15,544
- Nothing personal?!
- Don't throw that!

1157
01:19:15,669 --> 01:19:18,339
Nothing personal?! Nothing personal?!

1158
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:24,011
I raised all your games to another level!
Me! I did that!

1159
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:30,476
You on TV! You getting scouted!
Zigi, you might go lottery! I got that for you!

1160
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:34,647
And this is the thanks I get?
You make me sick.

1161
01:19:34,772 --> 01:19:39,860
Uh, Antoine, if they don't want you
to use them, use me. I can see it now.

1162
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:43,614
22 assists, 34 points, and ten boards.

1163
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:46,742
Together we can win tournament MVP.
Sounds good?

1164
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:49,203
- Man, shut up, Malik!
- I'm trying to go pro!

1165
01:19:49,328 --> 01:19:54,834
Kenny, I never wanted to die.
I had things I wanted to do. I had plans.

1166
01:19:54,959 --> 01:19:56,377
I know, man.

1167
01:19:56,502 --> 01:20:01,465
If you want me to go,
you just tell me and I'm gone.

1168
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:18,566
Jimmy, this is my brother, and, um…

1169
01:20:19,567 --> 01:20:22,820
..if he wants to stay, then he stays.

1170
01:20:22,945 --> 01:20:25,865
- OK, let's take it in.
- Let's go, Huskies.

1171
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:29,910
RC. RC. Hey.

1172
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:32,580
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

1173
01:20:32,705 --> 01:20:35,875
You wasn't at the banquet last night
nor at the conference this morning.

1174
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,877
- Where you at?
- Sorry, I've been busy.

1175
01:20:38,002 --> 01:20:39,336
Oh, you been writing?

1176
01:20:39,461 --> 01:20:42,590
Yes, writing, writing.
Uh, look, I have to go.

1177
01:20:42,715 --> 01:20:45,259
No, wait, RC, RC… I gotta talk to you.

1178
01:20:45,384 --> 01:20:48,345
It's really important, OK.
It's kinda difficult for me to say.

1179
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,347
- You don't have to, really.
- No, I need to.

1180
01:20:50,472 --> 01:20:53,517
Sometimes things happen
that are bigger than us.

1181
01:20:54,268 --> 01:20:56,979
Things that we really can't explain.

1182
01:20:57,104 --> 01:20:59,440
Things that make absolutely
no rational sense…

1183
01:20:59,565 --> 01:21:03,194
- Kenny, you don't… Really.
- I know this sounds crazy, believe me.

1184
01:21:03,319 --> 01:21:06,697
But… it's about Antoine.

1185
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,867
He's here.

1186
01:21:09,992 --> 01:21:12,119
Come on, Kenny.
Team meeting. Let's go.

1187
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:14,288
OK.

1188
01:21:14,413 --> 01:21:17,249
- Sweetie, you gotta believe me, OK?
- Kenny, come on!

1189
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:18,834
OK.

1190
01:21:19,543 --> 01:21:21,587
Coming, Coach.

1191
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:29,220
Oh, yeah, it's a great hotel.
It's got hot water between 7 and 7.30.

1192
01:21:29,345 --> 01:21:30,763
- Here she is. You looking for me?
- Yes, I wrote this piece that…

1193
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:35,768
RC, this is David Gallagher,
Sporting News.

1194
01:21:35,893 --> 01:21:38,854
- Ron Hammer, the Boston Globe.
- Nice meeting you, gentlemen.

1195
01:21:38,979 --> 01:21:40,648
I wanted to talk to you…

1196
01:21:40,773 --> 01:21:43,734
Gentlemen, keep an eye on this girl,
because she has the drive.

1197
01:21:43,859 --> 01:21:47,613
You know, I think she'd sell
her own mother for a good story.

1198
01:21:47,738 --> 01:21:51,242
So, what do you got for me?
Ready to win that Pulitzer? Hm?

1199
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:54,328
No. Not just yet anyway.

1200
01:21:54,453 --> 01:21:58,666
I got a little bit more work to do on it.
It was nice meeting you, gentlemen.

1201
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,253
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

1202
01:22:02,378 --> 01:22:06,590
Come on! Come on.

1203
01:22:06,715 --> 01:22:11,011
I don't know. It must be my personality.

1204
01:22:18,561 --> 01:22:20,604
There goes the story of the year.

1205
01:22:26,819 --> 01:22:30,614
Welcome to The Meadowlands,
home of the NCAA,

1206
01:22:30,739 --> 01:22:32,783
home of college basketball's
highest honor,

1207
01:22:32,908 --> 01:22:37,705
and home of all the pageantry
and excitement that is the Final Four.

1208
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:44,170
We kick off all the festivities
with UDub's Harry the Husky.

1209
01:22:44,295 --> 01:22:47,965
And Harry's gonna get set
for his patented slam dunk.

1210
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:51,218
And I say "get set" because
the stat sheet doesn't look good.

1211
01:22:51,343 --> 01:22:56,682
0 for 16 on the season for Harry.
So, folks, this could get a little bit ugly.

1212
01:22:56,765 --> 01:22:58,601
- Harry's ready.
- I'm going downtown.

1213
01:22:58,726 --> 01:23:01,562
And he calls his shot á la Babe Ruth.

1214
01:23:01,687 --> 01:23:03,814
Here we go.

1215
01:23:04,940 --> 01:23:06,901
Damn dog.

1216
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:11,989
Oh, he got it!

1217
01:23:12,990 --> 01:23:14,408
Did you guys see that?

1218
01:23:14,533 --> 01:23:18,078
Thank you. Thank you.

1219
01:23:20,414 --> 01:23:24,126
Billy, it's gonna be a long night for the
Huskies unless they can find someone

1220
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:27,671
to put those defensive handcuffs
on Georgetown's Jerrod Smith.

1221
01:23:27,796 --> 01:23:30,799
George, when you got a 6'5" point guard
that can go in the paint

1222
01:23:30,925 --> 01:23:34,094
and shoot the three, it's an impossible
match-up in the college level.

1223
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:37,223
I don't think the Huskies have
another upset in 'em tonight.

1224
01:23:37,348 --> 01:23:39,350
- Kenny Tyler.
- The infamous Jerrod Smith.

1225
01:23:39,475 --> 01:23:40,601
- What's up?
- How are you?

1226
01:23:40,726 --> 01:23:43,395
- All right. How you feelin', man?
- I'm good, man. Yeah.

1227
01:23:43,479 --> 01:23:45,689
I'm really sorry to hear
about your brother.

1228
01:23:45,814 --> 01:23:49,235
- Oh, thanks, man. I appreciate that.
- I wish he was here.

1229
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,237
Yeah. Me, too.

1230
01:23:51,362 --> 01:23:53,322
Get over there
and tell your team about me.

1231
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:56,033
Aw, come on, man,
you better tell your team about me.

1232
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:57,243
You better look up.

1233
01:23:57,368 --> 01:24:00,162
- I'm gonna get that ass, boy.
- We gonna get the ass.

1234
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:04,625
Smith brings it up, over to Douglas…

1235
01:24:04,750 --> 01:24:06,585
- Pass, pass.
- Back over to Smith.

1236
01:24:06,710 --> 01:24:08,796
- You take it, Jerrod!
- Get on him!

1237
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:12,007
Now Smith on the drive
at a 15-footer. Got it.

1238
01:24:12,132 --> 01:24:15,511
And that's 22 for Smith
here in the first half alone.

1239
01:24:15,636 --> 01:24:18,764
- Don't let Jerrod Smith do that.
- The Huskies just can't stop him.

1240
01:24:18,889 --> 01:24:22,643
That's 40-32 Hoyas,
as they roll on, led by Jerrod Smith.

1241
01:24:22,768 --> 01:24:24,728
Double-team Smith!
Double-team Smith!

1242
01:24:25,896 --> 01:24:28,732
Get the ball, Kenny! Get the ball!

1243
01:24:29,692 --> 01:24:31,610
- Oh, he's got the lane.
- Help out, Malik.

1244
01:24:33,612 --> 01:24:36,323
- Smith for two more…
- Damn!

1245
01:24:37,324 --> 01:24:38,659
They're scoring at will here.

1246
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,785
What are y'all doing?

1247
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:43,581
O'Grady now will try to guard him.
Nobody else has been able to.

1248
01:24:43,706 --> 01:24:47,084
Tyler in a double-team.
Jerrod passes inside Gruck

1249
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:50,754
and the no-look to Bergos
on the baseline. Easy deuce.

1250
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:55,009
They call a double-team on Jerrod
and he hurts 'em in other ways.

1251
01:24:56,802 --> 01:24:58,012
Jerrod on the dribble.

1252
01:24:58,137 --> 01:25:01,390
Time to play good D. Solid D, Kenny.
Watch him, going left.

1253
01:25:01,515 --> 01:25:04,226
Slam bam, thank you ma'am.
This guy is amazing.

1254
01:25:04,351 --> 01:25:06,478
You want me to handle it?
You want me to do it my way?

1255
01:25:06,604 --> 01:25:11,275
Cos I'll take care of him.
He ain't shit! Man.

1256
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:15,321
O'Grady now, across the timeline.
He runs into a Hoyas double-team.

1257
01:25:15,446 --> 01:25:17,114
Pass over to Tyler. Not a good one.

1258
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:20,618
Intercepted by Smith.
Smith on the break.

1259
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:33,088
- Smith is down and he's injured.
- What you doing, man?

1260
01:25:33,964 --> 01:25:36,759
Coach Thompson
and the trainers are called in.

1261
01:25:36,884 --> 01:25:40,054
And, man, you hate to see this kind
of injury in a game of this magnitude.

1262
01:25:40,179 --> 01:25:42,181
- My shoulder.
- Jerrod, what's wrong?

1263
01:25:42,306 --> 01:25:44,517
- My shoulder.
- Just be careful. Take your time.

1264
01:25:44,642 --> 01:25:46,101
Stay there. Stay there.

1265
01:25:47,603 --> 01:25:52,149
And the heavily favored Hoyas
lose to UDub 78-65.

1266
01:25:52,274 --> 01:25:56,779
And now, the Huskies
move on to the big show.

1267
01:26:11,669 --> 01:26:17,007
- Kenny?
- Hey. What's up, RC? How you doing?

1268
01:26:18,884 --> 01:26:20,302
How is he?

1269
01:26:20,427 --> 01:26:23,514
I don't know. He's been
in surgery for over an hour.

1270
01:26:23,639 --> 01:26:29,395
I know he got a broken collarbone.
Concussion, too. Yeah.

1271
01:26:30,604 --> 01:26:33,524
I hope he's all right. God.

1272
01:26:35,025 --> 01:26:37,862
Kenny, it's your brother, isn't it?

1273
01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:44,034
- Yeah.
- So tell him to stop.

1274
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:49,039
It's no use, RC. He ain't gonna
listen to me. He never listens to me.

1275
01:26:49,164 --> 01:26:51,667
He's the older brother.
He calls the shots.

1276
01:26:51,792 --> 01:26:57,339
Kenny, look at yourself. Antoine is dead
and he's still running your life.

1277
01:26:57,464 --> 01:27:01,051
You don't know what you're talking
about. First of all, you don't know us.

1278
01:27:01,177 --> 01:27:05,598
You just don't know what it's like trying
to live my life without my brother.

1279
01:27:16,942 --> 01:27:18,986
Stupid…

1280
01:27:20,404 --> 01:27:23,199
No, I don't know what it's like.

1281
01:27:25,492 --> 01:27:28,704
But neither will you until you let him go.

1282
01:27:38,464 --> 01:27:40,508
Antoine?

1283
01:27:51,435 --> 01:27:54,188
Yo, Antoine.

1284
01:27:54,897 --> 01:27:56,941
Antoine?

1285
01:27:58,484 --> 01:28:01,153
Antoine, I know you in here.

1286
01:28:01,237 --> 01:28:03,447
Yeah, I'm here.

1287
01:28:03,572 --> 01:28:05,908
You always did like being
first in the locker room.

1288
01:28:06,033 --> 01:28:09,495
Oh, that's only because
I was always so nervous, kid.

1289
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,413
- Word?
- Yeah, man.

1290
01:28:11,539 --> 01:28:15,543
I'd come into the locker room,
see all these jerseys hanging,

1291
01:28:16,585 --> 01:28:19,255
and I'd find the one with my name on it.

1292
01:28:20,130 --> 01:28:25,928
And I would just sit down, stare at it…
wondering if I could go out there,

1293
01:28:26,053 --> 01:28:29,348
Lace 'em one more time
and live up to the hype.

1294
01:28:31,183 --> 01:28:34,979
Damn. I didn't know you were scared.

1295
01:28:35,104 --> 01:28:39,859
Baby brother, I played scared
every game of my life.

1296
01:28:39,984 --> 01:28:43,404
Wondering how I would do,
what people would think.

1297
01:28:44,154 --> 01:28:47,032
But I tell you something,
I'm not scared no more. No, sir.

1298
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:49,660
This is one game I am going to enjoy.

1299
01:28:50,661 --> 01:28:52,705
Yeah, well, um…

1300
01:28:53,747 --> 01:28:56,625
You're gonna have to enjoy it
from the bench, Ant.

1301
01:28:58,502 --> 01:29:00,713
What are you saying?

1302
01:29:00,838 --> 01:29:03,924
Wait a minute, if this is about
Jerrod Smith, that was an accident.

1303
01:29:04,049 --> 01:29:06,719
You know me better than that.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

1304
01:29:06,802 --> 01:29:11,015
Antoine, look. You got us here.
No doubt about it, man.

1305
01:29:11,140 --> 01:29:13,309
Without you,
we'd be watching this on TV.

1306
01:29:13,434 --> 01:29:18,981
- Exactly.
- But, kid, this is cheating. It's wrong.

1307
01:29:20,107 --> 01:29:23,068
I'm sorry, Ant. You can't play, man.

1308
01:29:23,194 --> 01:29:27,239
- Oh, please. I'm playing, Kenny.
- You're gonna be playing alone.

1309
01:29:28,365 --> 01:29:32,161
Kenny, think about it.
NCAA title - one more game.

1310
01:29:32,286 --> 01:29:34,538
It's what we always dreamed about,
me and you.

1311
01:29:34,663 --> 01:29:37,750
Since we was kids, we've been partners.

1312
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:42,838
Antoine, we ain't never
been partners, man.

1313
01:29:43,547 --> 01:29:47,343
I've been your sidekick
for over 20 years, kid.

1314
01:29:47,468 --> 01:29:52,264
And I was happy to be that, but I can't
do it no more, Ant. I just can't do it.

1315
01:29:53,265 --> 01:29:55,476
Now if you step on
that court tonight, it's over.

1316
01:29:55,601 --> 01:29:59,563
What are you gonna do?
How you gonna stop me? Huh?

1317
01:30:08,572 --> 01:30:10,616
We'll walk.

1318
01:30:22,253 --> 01:30:25,756
- We'll just forfeit.
- You will lose without me.

1319
01:30:30,344 --> 01:30:32,388
Then we'll just lose.

1320
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:12,678
Welcome to the NCAA
National Championship.

1321
01:31:12,803 --> 01:31:16,098
Come on, get in here, guys. Get in.
Listen up now. Listen up. Come on.

1322
01:31:16,223 --> 01:31:20,978
You know, when I was a kid, I played in
the biggest basketball game of my life.

1323
01:31:21,103 --> 01:31:25,024
It was the Wilmington-Delaware
Youth League Championship.

1324
01:31:25,149 --> 01:31:27,902
And the winning prize
was a shiny gold medal.

1325
01:31:30,237 --> 01:31:34,116
Well, you know, we should've won
that game, but we didn't.

1326
01:31:34,241 --> 01:31:38,662
And I always felt that if I had
played just a little bit better…

1327
01:31:38,787 --> 01:31:42,708
You know, if I had really played
my guts out, that we would've won.

1328
01:31:42,833 --> 01:31:46,086
And I would've won that medal.

1329
01:31:46,212 --> 01:31:50,007
Well, now this is the… This is the
biggest game of your lives.

1330
01:31:50,966 --> 01:31:55,262
And it's just you guys, two orange
hoops, 94 feet of hardwood.

1331
01:31:56,472 --> 01:32:00,392
So go out there and play
the very best that you can,

1332
01:32:00,518 --> 01:32:02,645
and really play your guts out.

1333
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:07,107
And believe me, you will have no
regrets. And you will win your medal.

1334
01:32:07,233 --> 01:32:11,278
Just go out there and play the game
that you love. Come on!

1335
01:32:11,403 --> 01:32:13,239
Let's go! Let's go!

1336
01:32:16,534 --> 01:32:19,370
And the Huskies take the floor,
led by Kenny Tyler,

1337
01:32:19,495 --> 01:32:22,498
who's assumed leadership of this team
following the tragic loss

1338
01:32:22,623 --> 01:32:24,708
of his brother Antoine earlier this year.

1339
01:32:24,834 --> 01:32:27,044
The UMass Minutemen,
they're the favorites.

1340
01:32:27,169 --> 01:32:30,256
They come into the tournament
the number-one ranking

1341
01:32:30,381 --> 01:32:32,132
in all of college basketball.

1342
01:32:32,258 --> 01:32:35,970
Won't look for any upsets here.
Three future NBA stars on this club:

1343
01:32:36,095 --> 01:32:39,682
6'5" point guard, Rudy Olivera,
6'9" power forward, JJ Sampson,

1344
01:32:39,807 --> 01:32:41,809
and 6'10" forward, Mark Tucker.

1345
01:32:41,934 --> 01:32:45,271
I don't even think lady luck
can help the Huskies tonight.

1346
01:32:45,396 --> 01:32:47,606
Hrbacek and Sampson, the jump center.

1347
01:32:47,731 --> 01:32:50,776
And it's controlled by UMass,
over to Olivera.

1348
01:32:50,901 --> 01:32:53,946
You gotta push the ball, Olivera.
Push the ball.

1349
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:57,533
- Sampson, down low.
- Zigi, Zigi, stay on him!

1350
01:32:57,658 --> 01:33:01,912
In the paint, a finger roll
and the early lead goes to UMass.

1351
01:33:02,538 --> 01:33:05,583
Go down! Give me two, give me two!

1352
01:33:05,708 --> 01:33:07,418
Tyler to O'Grady.

1353
01:33:07,543 --> 01:33:09,753
Hustle up, Danny.
Move that ball. Come on.

1354
01:33:09,879 --> 01:33:14,175
Dish back to Tyler. Tyler, with a look
and a shot that's way off the mark.

1355
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,844
- Ooh.
- Goddamn.

1356
01:33:16,969 --> 01:33:19,930
Crosscourts it to Sampson,
out to Olivera.

1357
01:33:20,055 --> 01:33:21,640
Breakaway, easy deuce.

1358
01:33:21,765 --> 01:33:24,310
The Huskies are still having
trouble getting started.

1359
01:33:24,435 --> 01:33:28,772
We're midway through the half. UMass
leads 20 to eight. Back the other way.

1360
01:33:29,607 --> 01:33:33,360
The dish outside.
Moore, top of the key, he got it.

1361
01:33:33,485 --> 01:33:37,448
Nothing but the bottom of the net.
And the Huskies are down 14.

1362
01:33:38,699 --> 01:33:39,909
Get your hands off me!

1363
01:33:40,034 --> 01:33:44,663
Major has a look and sets,
and he'll take the three and he got it.

1364
01:33:44,788 --> 01:33:48,626
The Husky fans cheer their underdog
UDub squad for that three,

1365
01:33:48,751 --> 01:33:52,546
but it's hardly enough to send
the Minutemen packing.

1366
01:33:52,671 --> 01:33:55,591
Bounce pass down
to the baseline to Moore.

1367
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:59,553
To Tucker. Tucker tosses it to Olivera.
Downcourt back-door lob.

1368
01:33:59,678 --> 01:34:02,348
And Sampson finishes that one off.

1369
01:34:03,307 --> 01:34:05,809
UMass just too strong tonight
for the Huskies,

1370
01:34:05,935 --> 01:34:10,981
as they pull to a 14-point advantage
with five minutes to go in the half.

1371
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:16,195
Olivera proving his all-American
status in this half,

1372
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:19,532
and he'll finish it with… a score!

1373
01:34:19,657 --> 01:34:25,746
Well, UMass leads 42 to 22 at half-time,
Billy, and I guess the $64,000 question

1374
01:34:25,871 --> 01:34:29,166
right now is, has that magic
that brought the Huskies

1375
01:34:29,291 --> 01:34:33,045
into the Final Four
finally abandoned them?

1376
01:34:34,129 --> 01:34:39,468
- Oh, man, it's over!
- We suck. We suck!

1377
01:34:40,261 --> 01:34:42,972
- We are pathetic.
- How many points we down, man?

1378
01:34:43,097 --> 01:34:46,809
- We down 20 points!
- It feels worse than that.

1379
01:34:54,817 --> 01:34:57,528
Let's be honest. We never
expected them to get this far.

1380
01:34:57,653 --> 01:35:00,990
It's amazing where they are. Too much
talent down the other end of the floor.

1381
01:35:01,115 --> 01:35:02,533
They're outclassed tonight.

1382
01:35:03,868 --> 01:35:08,831
Fellas, fellas, the hole's been dug, man.
They're just gonna bury us.

1383
01:35:10,416 --> 01:35:15,087
Guys, we just can't do it without Antoine.

1384
01:35:17,423 --> 01:35:19,633
We don't have to, Zigi.

1385
01:35:19,758 --> 01:35:21,886
Man, what are you saying, Kenny?

1386
01:35:23,429 --> 01:35:28,350
I'm saying I wanna win this. I didn't
come this far to go home empty-handed.

1387
01:35:28,475 --> 01:35:30,519
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1388
01:35:30,644 --> 01:35:35,983
Malik, we are down 20 points, man.
20 points! Do you know why?

1389
01:35:36,066 --> 01:35:38,110
I know why! Cos we suck.

1390
01:35:38,235 --> 01:35:41,322
See, that's bull. We don't suck!
They suck!

1391
01:35:41,447 --> 01:35:44,783
It's bullshit, man!
We're playing with no soul!

1392
01:35:44,909 --> 01:35:48,662
Cos we played that first half
without Antoine. Face it.

1393
01:35:49,705 --> 01:35:52,750
There's only one way
we gonna get back in this game.

1394
01:35:54,585 --> 01:35:55,794
What you saying?

1395
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:59,381
I'm saying we go back out in that court,
Jimmy, and we take Antoine with us.

1396
01:35:59,507 --> 01:36:04,345
- No, no, no. We already agreed…
- Right here. Right here, Jimmy.

1397
01:36:05,429 --> 01:36:07,598
Right here.

1398
01:36:09,099 --> 01:36:11,602
Everything my brother was…

1399
01:36:14,563 --> 01:36:19,151
Everything he gave us… is all right there.

1400
01:36:23,113 --> 01:36:27,159
Right here. Right here.

1401
01:36:29,828 --> 01:36:33,040
We gotta go out there and we gotta
shoot with him, we gotta run with him,

1402
01:36:33,165 --> 01:36:36,627
we gotta play with him…
We have to win with him, Malik.

1403
01:36:54,019 --> 01:36:56,230
Are you all with me?

1404
01:36:57,731 --> 01:36:59,817
- We're with you. Let's go.
- We're with you.

1405
01:36:59,942 --> 01:37:02,611
Let's do this. Let's go all the way now!

1406
01:37:02,695 --> 01:37:05,739
- We're with you, Kenny.
- Malik? Jimmy?

1407
01:37:05,865 --> 01:37:10,494
- Let's go. Let's do this!
- Let's go out there and win this game.

1408
01:37:11,829 --> 01:37:13,998
Let's go, baby!

1409
01:37:14,665 --> 01:37:17,126
The Huskies have hit the floor running.

1410
01:37:17,251 --> 01:37:21,964
Start of the second half, they're on
a 10-0 run. And they are fired up.

1411
01:37:22,089 --> 01:37:24,466
Kenny Tyler, top of the key, for three!

1412
01:37:24,592 --> 01:37:27,720
Kenny Tyler is lighting it up
on both ends of the court now.

1413
01:37:27,845 --> 01:37:31,265
O'Grady looks for someone.
Gets it to Tyler on the wing.

1414
01:37:31,390 --> 01:37:34,727
Tyler drives to the paint,
the 15-footer. It's good.

1415
01:37:34,852 --> 01:37:37,646
Kenny Tyler has electrified this crowd.
They're on their feet.

1416
01:37:37,771 --> 01:37:40,274
Holy smokes, Billy.
Kenny Tyler's on fire.

1417
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:42,860
What an incredible performance
by this young man.

1418
01:37:42,985 --> 01:37:46,155
It really is, George. You love to see
big players come up in big games.

1419
01:37:46,280 --> 01:37:49,325
He's put this team on his back
and he's carrying them tonight.

1420
01:37:49,450 --> 01:37:54,830
Tyler fakes left, circles in,
drives, jumpshot up and it is good…

1421
01:37:54,955 --> 01:37:58,125
- They're doing it, Mikulski.
- Danny! Hit Lik. Hit Lik.

1422
01:37:58,250 --> 01:38:01,170
O'Grady, the lob. Major with a slam!

1423
01:38:01,295 --> 01:38:05,841
And, ladies and gentlemen,
we have a ballgame.

1424
01:38:05,966 --> 01:38:08,636
- Set up. I'm coming back now.
- That's it. That's it!

1425
01:38:08,761 --> 01:38:11,347
In. In, baby, right here!

1426
01:38:11,472 --> 01:38:12,723
Go, Kenny! Go, Kenny!

1427
01:38:12,848 --> 01:38:15,518
Major to O'Grady.
O'Grady back to Tyler.

1428
01:38:15,643 --> 01:38:18,729
Fakes left, goes right,
fadeaway. He got it.

1429
01:38:18,854 --> 01:38:21,190
- And the Huskies pull to within 11.
- Right here!

1430
01:38:21,315 --> 01:38:24,068
O'Grady now, over to Hrbacek.
Way out on the wing.

1431
01:38:24,193 --> 01:38:28,864
Sky-hook for three, and Zigi hit it
from downtown for the triple.

1432
01:38:28,989 --> 01:38:31,116
That's it, you American scum, that's it!

1433
01:38:31,242 --> 01:38:33,953
Motion, baby. Motion.

1434
01:38:34,078 --> 01:38:36,622
Olivera makes the lay-in
to hold the lead at five.

1435
01:38:36,747 --> 01:38:39,083
Two minutes. Two minutes
and we down five, baby.

1436
01:38:39,208 --> 01:38:41,252
Kenny Tyler cuts it down to three.

1437
01:38:41,377 --> 01:38:46,715
Major into Tyler. Tyler fakes,
high archer off the glass.

1438
01:38:46,799 --> 01:38:51,053
He got it. And the double
brings the Huskies to within two.

1439
01:38:52,304 --> 01:38:54,265
And a time-out called by the Huskies.

1440
01:38:54,390 --> 01:38:56,976
The Minutemen clinging
to a two-point advantage

1441
01:38:57,101 --> 01:38:59,270
with just 16 seconds left on the clock.

1442
01:38:59,395 --> 01:39:01,814
OK, guys, 16 seconds left
to a National Championship.

1443
01:39:01,939 --> 01:39:03,440
We gotta keep Tyler from beating us.

1444
01:39:03,566 --> 01:39:05,776
And then we run the three
with Kenny, OK?

1445
01:39:05,901 --> 01:39:07,528
Kenny, you make the shot, all right?

1446
01:39:07,653 --> 01:39:10,948
Let's take this one home, fellas. This
is it. This is what we came here for.

1447
01:39:11,073 --> 01:39:14,827
- OK, come on. Dawgs up, you guys!
- Dawgs up! Dawgs up!

1448
01:39:15,995 --> 01:39:17,162
Come on, Zigi!

1449
01:39:17,288 --> 01:39:18,455
UMass!

1450
01:39:18,581 --> 01:39:21,959
And who would've thought the Huskies
would even be in this position.

1451
01:39:22,084 --> 01:39:24,170
16 seconds on the clock.

1452
01:39:24,295 --> 01:39:28,174
A chance at being a giant killer
of the number-one team in the country.

1453
01:39:28,299 --> 01:39:31,886
The Huskies are lining up. The
Minutemen'll use man-to-man defense.

1454
01:39:32,011 --> 01:39:36,056
We have to assume Pederson's made
the call to Tyler for the game winner.

1455
01:39:36,182 --> 01:39:39,768
Moore is all over LaSalle.
He doesn't want a five-second call here.

1456
01:39:39,894 --> 01:39:43,898
Finally, the in-bound is stolen by Tucker.
And that is it.

1457
01:39:44,023 --> 01:39:46,400
If they can hold on to it,
the championship is theirs.

1458
01:39:46,525 --> 01:39:50,154
Nine seconds to go. All UMass
has to do is to occupy this ball.

1459
01:39:50,279 --> 01:39:53,324
The Huskies step up the D,
but time is running out.

1460
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:58,871
Somebody's gotta force a turnover
or a foul here or this one's in the books.

1461
01:39:58,996 --> 01:40:02,166
O'Grady on Tucker. We're down
to seven seconds and counting.

1462
01:40:02,291 --> 01:40:05,961
O'Grady on him like a pit bull,
trying to make something happen.

1463
01:40:06,086 --> 01:40:08,839
Five seconds left.
Someone needs a play here.

1464
01:40:10,007 --> 01:40:11,300
No turnovers. Don't turn!

1465
01:40:11,425 --> 01:40:14,303
Tucker trying to pass to Olivera
and Tyler gets a hand on it.

1466
01:40:14,428 --> 01:40:16,889
- Here comes Tyler again.
- Go! Go!

1467
01:40:18,265 --> 01:40:19,892
Come on!

1468
01:40:23,479 --> 01:40:26,440
Tyler again, he's got it. He goes up.

1469
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:35,533
I got it, Kenny!

1470
01:40:36,492 --> 01:40:38,827
Ant, no!

1471
01:40:40,579 --> 01:40:42,790
Let it go.

1472
01:40:56,679 --> 01:40:58,806
It's good!

1473
01:40:58,931 --> 01:41:01,100
Yeah!

1474
01:41:06,647 --> 01:41:08,732
Oh, my God!

1475
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:30,129
Yeah! All the way!
Number one! All the way!

1476
01:41:30,254 --> 01:41:33,257
- We did it, baby!
- No, you did it.

1477
01:41:38,345 --> 01:41:40,556
I gotta go see the coach.
I'll be right back, OK?

1478
01:41:40,681 --> 01:41:42,766
OK.

1479
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:44,977
- Hey, RC!
- Hey!

1480
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:53,068
Antoine. Wait!

1481
01:41:54,236 --> 01:41:55,738
Antoine!

1482
01:41:56,572 --> 01:41:58,616
Antoine!

1483
01:42:00,951 --> 01:42:03,537
Antoine, wait! Ant!

1484
01:42:04,371 --> 01:42:06,248
Antoine…

1485
01:42:09,919 --> 01:42:11,212
We did it, baby.

1486
01:42:11,337 --> 01:42:16,550
No, you did it,
like I never let you do it before.

1487
01:42:17,092 --> 01:42:19,595
And you looked good doing it, too.

1488
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,181
I had a good teacher.

1489
01:42:22,973 --> 01:42:25,017
Yeah.

1490
01:42:27,436 --> 01:42:31,357
They're calling me.
They want me to play on the team.

1491
01:42:31,482 --> 01:42:35,694
They said I might make the starting five
if I learn not to hog the ball.

1492
01:42:41,075 --> 01:42:44,245
- I love you. Come here, man.
- I love you.

1493
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:46,830
It's OK. I love you.

1494
01:42:47,873 --> 01:42:49,583
Bye, Antoine.

1495
01:42:49,708 --> 01:42:55,297
No, no, no. No goodbyes.
Cos I'll always be with you.

1496
01:42:55,422 --> 01:42:58,092
Hey, it's like Pop says.

1497
01:42:59,844 --> 01:43:02,096
If you and I stick together…

1498
01:43:06,183 --> 01:43:09,478
..anything can happen.

1499
01:43:09,603 --> 01:43:12,523
You gonna be all right, man.

1500
01:43:14,066 --> 01:43:17,403
But if you don't repeat next year,
I'll be back.

1501
01:43:29,707 --> 01:43:31,959
Here I come.

1502
01:43:35,838 --> 01:43:37,214
Yeah!

1503
01:43:38,757 --> 01:43:40,176
All right. All right!

1504
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:43,429
Yeah, baby! Huskies!
Number one, baby!

1505
01:43:45,723 --> 01:43:48,392
Yeah, Coach! Number one, baby!

1506
01:43:48,475 --> 01:43:52,980
Huskies! Whoo! Huskies, baby!

1507
01:43:53,105 --> 01:43:55,149
Huskies!

1508
01:43:56,025 --> 01:43:59,737
Whoo! Yeah, baby!

1509
01:44:08,954 --> 01:44:14,084
- That's our sixth man, isn't it?
- Yeah, Coach.

1510
01:44:16,086 --> 01:44:21,175
A and K… all the way, baby.

1511
01:44:21,300 --> 01:44:25,638
Yeah! Yeah!

1512
01:44:27,765 --> 01:44:30,351
Yeah, baby!

1513
01:44:30,476 --> 01:44:32,645
You the man, Coach!
