10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,129
Stop! Where are you going!

11
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,184
Wolf?

12
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,844
That's right, sir lieutenant.

13
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,031
What are you doing here?
Where are the others?

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,536
Vanadek has taken, is
regrouping to new positions.

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,551
What a regrouping, what
are you talking about, boy!

16
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,631
Do you hear? There's a general!

17
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,633
Get up, general's order!

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,444
Kholera, Vanadek told me...

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,456
Fuck Vanadek!

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,153
Come on, group! Run, follow me!

21
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,033
Get up! Get up!

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,710
Run! Germans!

23
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,143
General killed!

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,913
What? What you said?

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,025
General killed!

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,391
To stand! Stop!

27
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,668
Stop! And it's you, Dark One,

28
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,910
Headquarters in which direction?

29
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,936
Over there. Hurry up and you'll get it.

30
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,394
The general asked about you

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,785
Who?

32
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,305
General. He got a little,
Grinfeld takes care of him.

33
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,224
Colonel, what about the general?

34
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,747
Died. You should know
about it, damn it, or not?

35
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,707
Yes, but the sentry said...

36
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,287
Listen. The squad is in
danger of destruction.

37
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,084
Two squads scattered when they
learned about the death of the general,

38
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,776
Therefore one must pay attention
- you must say that the general

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,609
is injured, understand?

40
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,670
There is.

41
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,045
Here is the order to the departments.
General's order, okay?

42
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,309
I understand.

43
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,886
Let's try to retreat at night.

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,092
But we are surrounded!

45
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,576
It seems to the Germans that way,
because there is no way to go through

46
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,886
the swamp, and
everything else is cut off.

47
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,890
But we must try,
there is no other way,

48
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,856
So, in half an hour the Wolf will go,
you and Elka and people from

49
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,565
the patrol will follow the Wolf.

50
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,588
Just remember - not a word
about the general, okay?

51
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,670
I understand.

52
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,256
For what dashing are
you going to this Boldyn?

53
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,772
This is boor, boor and rude.

54
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,031
I don't understand. Which Boldyn?

55
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,471
I'm not going to any Boldyn.

56
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,016
That's exactly what I'm thinking...

57
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,964
What is the Polish intellectual
looking for in this barbarian?

58
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,308
You arrived on a
train full of thieves

59
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,385
only to get from
thieves to bandits?

60
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,250
Strange people.

61
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,656
When I actually...

62
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,671
So, are you going to trade?

63
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,690
Do you have any items
with you? Or money?

64
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,991
Lay out on the table.

65
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,044
Well, where's the money?

66
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,289
Now you see that
miracles do not happen.

67
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,688
You went to Boldyn because
you couldn't take it any more, no?

68
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,090
Do you know...

69
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,854
that this road to Boldyn is open?

70
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,232
He has not been sending any
of his own through Avissa lately.

71
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,129
Now do you understand
why I'm talking to you?

72
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,911
Not really.

73
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,472
Because you are gone.

74
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,976
Do you know for whom?

75
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,896
Not for me, not for the Gestapo.

76
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,708
Not even for the Millennium Reich,
which you don't believe in.

77
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,185
After all,
there is something above all this.

78
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,776
There is a certain
community of Europe,

79
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,553
which is threatened
by such Boldyn.

80
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,332
In this Europe there is
a place for your people.

81
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,690
But not necessarily.
Do you understand it?

82
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,816
It is impossible to
throw France out of

83
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,496
Europe, for example,
let alone Germany.

84
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,251
Each such attempt is
worth at least one world war.

85
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,474
But with Poland...
it's not so obvious.

86
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,313
So listen, sir Pakosh.

87
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,851
Now you know why I spend
so much time on you.

88
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,588
You were going to Boldyn - go.

89
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,492
We are giving you
a great life chance.

90
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,113
Wait here.

91
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,991
Think about what I told you.

92
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,271
About Europe, first of all.

93
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,490
Fedor!

94
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,856
Who are you?

95
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,212
I? I'm from Warsaw!

96
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,187
Yes, speculator,
come on, run away.

97
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,611
Fedor! Fedor!

98
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,890
Batsmag! Do you have Fedor?

99
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,694
No.

100
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,292
So you yawn! Come back, and
don't come back without Fedor!

101
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,049
I will!

102
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,456
And who are you? Speculator?

103
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,536
No, I'm with you.

104
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,576
To us, to us! Now everyone is with us!

105
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,616
Attention people! I give you
three minutes! And then we'll shoot!

106
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,053
Well! Run! Wherever you want, quickly!

107
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,816
He is not here!

108
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,776
Have you looked everywhere?

109
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,505
Nowhere to be found!

110
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,434
Damn it, Kholera!

111
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,550
What do we do now...

112
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,193
What did you forget here?

113
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,351
Yesterday, on the tracks, one was shot...

114
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,289
When?

115
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,310
As soon as arrived.

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,967
Swipe.

117
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,463
Somewhere here lay.

118
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,590
What did he look like?

119
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,511
Usually.

120
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,545
Usually!

121
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,063
Do you hear, Batsmega?
Fedor is ordinary, he says!

122
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,586
Boys, come to me!

123
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,232
Yes, sir!

124
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,111
Chechot, where is Fat?

125
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,971
Sent to the cemetery. Until he was seen

126
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,967
And with a machine gun?

127
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,945
Not any more.

128
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,184
As it was, after all!

129
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,588
Dragged away.

130
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,933
Batsmaga, Chechot, clear the station.

131
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,529
As ordered!

132
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,506
If so, you know.

133
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,130
And you follow me!

134
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,925
What do you have here?

135
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,149
Here, Kholera, clung.

136
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,383
Where did he not exist?

137
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,614
The devil knows,
he drove up from the other side.

138
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,673
Well, lads, we'll either cross the
river, or we'll all be run over here.

139
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,790
Maybe on a boat?

140
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,813
And where to look for it?

141
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,967
Now?

142
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,536
I think so:

143
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,656
let two crawl up with lemons
and a Molotov cocktail.

144
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,776
Do you think we'll screw up?

145
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,816
Let's fill up.

146
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,989
Well, take Botyan, and go!

147
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,150
Good.

148
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,846
Kholera. Everything is with them.

149
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,265
Everything is with us.
That's all, fuck your mother!

150
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,244
Who said? Karchokh?
Well, forward to the bridge!

151
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:08,929
One?

152
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,976
Who is a volunteer?

153
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,593
Karchoh, go ahead!

154
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,126
Who else is a volunteer?

155
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,576
Do you have a grenade?

156
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,256
No.

157
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,566
Kholera.

158
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,911
Listen, I'll crawl under the
bridge and come in from the rear.

159
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,447
You get on the road...

160
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,031
and get out of what you have there.

161
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,690
Comrade Colonel, Citizen
Speculator, on your orders.

162
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,053
I'm fine, thank you. You can go.

163
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,391
And you pass.

164
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,172
It's already dark...

165
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,210
Winter is coming... Sit down.

166
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,536
Pakosh Mechislav... Father in
captivity, teacher by profession...

167
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,176
Mother is also a teacher...

168
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,134
Well well...

169
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,351
Well... How did
you come to Avissa?

170
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,453
I could no longer stand it,
I could not look at them.

171
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,925
Should have done something

172
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,711
This is also possible in Warsaw.

173
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,553
You did not have contacts,
acquaintances?

174
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,914
No, I decided to go to
General Boldyn myself.

175
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,133
And why specifically
to General Boldyn?

176
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,351
Because he fights.

177
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,736
Not too willing.

178
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,183
Well, that means you were
going to see General Boldyn...

179
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,310
So what?

180
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,613
The Germans dropped us off the
train and herded us to the station...

181
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,685
No thank you.

182
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,456
Were you interrogated?

183
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,296
Yes.

184
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,754
And what did they want from you?

185
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,184
I have no idea.

186
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,049
Thought you were a speculator?

187
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,714
No where.

188
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,569
Maybe you have found something?
Some papers, newspapers...

189
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,685
There is nothing. Felt a little.

190
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,736
Listen, Speculator...

191
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,751
Haven't you seen...

192
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,390
such...

193
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:05,068
tall, humpbacked nose,
thick eyebrows, fused?

194
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,890
No, I didn't.

195
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,569
And during the interrogation...
they didn’t ask you about Fedor?

196
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,670
No.

197
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,334
What happened to that bridge?

198
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,014
Why did you rush without weapons?

199
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,351
What did you expect?

200
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,374
Comrade Wolf called out:
"Who is the volunteer?"

201
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,176
Well, I accept
you in my brigade.

202
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,508
You will be in the Wolf section.

203
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,725
Why colleague?

204
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,090
You rushed.

205
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,725
We actually talked...

206
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,687
Have you written everything?

207
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,211
Yes, Citizen Captain.

208
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,092
Allow me to go.

209
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,753
I'll go check the posts.

210
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,286
Sivek in the yard.

211
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,189
Well, speak up.

212
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,791
What, Comrade Captain?

213
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,571
Everything. Why did you go to Avissa?

214
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,484
I wanted to see General Boldyn.

215
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,131
What for?

216
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,631
I don't understand, Citizen Captain.

217
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,805
Don't understand?

218
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,766
What are you?

219
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,594
What education do you have?

220
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,344
Secondary school.

221
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,108
What about higher education?

222
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,976
Before the war, a year in law.

223
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,183
And in the occupation?

224
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,788
Few courses.

225
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,793
Were you in an organisation?

226
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,768
No.

227
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,631
So why to Boldyn?

228
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,489
All Warsaw is talking about him.

229
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,025
All?

230
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,388
Many say.

231
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,909
Do you know anyone from the party?

232
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,746
No.

233
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,727
Weird.

234
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,393
What's strange, Citizen Captain?

235
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,925
Do you want to say something else?

236
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,874
My conscience is clear.

237
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,809
And besides conscience,
what can you refer to?

238
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,304
Sivek!

239
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,893
Weapon.

240
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,412
Well!

241
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,452
Who sent you?

242
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,191
Captain Siebert.

243
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,566
Shut up!

244
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,736
And don't play dumb

245
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,933
Who sent you to spy on us?

246
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,771
Speak, bitch!

247
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,776
Speak or I'll crush
you like a dog!

248
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,643
Go away!

249
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,450
You still resist!

250
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,334
Hide this or...

251
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,128
But the fact that!..

252
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,806
And then I'll go to Boldyn.

253
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,096
I will go to you!

254
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,508
Who the hell is there!

255
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,753
You, Rybarchik, again For your own.

256
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,086
What do you need here?

257
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,372
Who gave you permission?

258
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,028
What should you have asked?

259
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,565
Did you even ask the captain?

260
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,587
What is there to ask,
the matter is clear - sent.

261
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,364
I would tell you it's clear...

262
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,092
Listen, Elka...

263
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,328
To whom Elka, and to
whom - citizen sergeant.

264
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,551
To the captain for
instructions, now.

265
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,486
I must speak at
once to the General!

266
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,090
They're here now,
don't interfere.

267
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,693
But I don't understand!

268
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,870
Then you will understand.

269
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,969
Do you think you
went to university?

270
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:26,963
Yes.

271
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,606
Comrade Captain, I was just
interrogating him, and Elka...

272
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,194
Sergeant Vinyarskaya.

273
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,591
And Sergeant Vinyarskaya says
that the captain told him to release him.

274
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,376
The lieutenant is lying, I did not
say that I said to release, I only asked

275
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,391
if I ordered to be interrogated.

276
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,864
Your business?

277
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,765
No, Comrade Captain?

278
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,292
I didn't tell him to
question him, Lieutenant.

279
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,510
You see.

280
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,989
I didn't tell him to release him.

281
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,793
What did you say,
Comrade Captain?

282
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,770
Carry him back.

283
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,443
Yes, sir!

284
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,245
You see, Comrade Colonel,
what conditions are created for us.

285
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,304
So...

286
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,523
What do you call yourself?
Speculator?

287
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,671
That's right, Comrade Colonel,

288
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,751
Why did you choose such
a name for yourself?

289
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,711
It's not me, the department gave me.

290
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,165
And if you could come up with something
yourself, which one would you choose?

291
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,064
Maybe reckoning?

292
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,153
We have half a dozen of them.

293
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,493
Revenge?

294
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,988
There are enough of those too.

295
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,086
Because in the department...

296
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,532
In the department it is so,
but here it is different.

297
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,064
Well.

298
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,283
What impressed you
the most here with us?

299
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,167
Darkness.

300
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,573
Darkness.

301
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,071
Dark? Dark type.

302
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,486
Mrachnyy?

303
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,065
Mrachnyy? Good.

304
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,306
From today you will be Mrachnyy.

305
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:18,309
Citizen sergeant, you need to give
him uniforms and some kind of weapon.

306
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,627
And hurry! To be
ready in an hour.

307
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,776
Attention!

308
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,393
Alignment to the left!

309
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,168
Citizen General, Colonel Protsnal reports:
the department is ready for your orders.

310
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,145
Thank you.

311
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,984
Command freely.

312
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,514
Attention! At ease!

313
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,488
Order number 64.

314
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,576
Carrying out a combat mission, the
department under the command of

315
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:57,686
Volk occupied the Avissa railway
station with a bold attack, damaged the
tracks and equipment of the station.

316
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,976
Released a large number of prisoners.
Up to 15 fascists died during the action.

317
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:10,691
A large number of weapons and
ammunition were captured. Our losses
are 2 dead. Eternal memory to them.

318
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,216
During the operation, a heroic deed
was performed by the volunteer Mrachnyy.

319
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,016
When the enemy's armoured car
cut off the department's retreat,

320
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,456
Mrachnyy, unarmed, rushed to
the armoured car and set it on fire,

321
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,552
Thanks to this, the department was
able to return without further losses.

322
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,167
For this heroic deed, I award the Volunteer
Mrachnyy the rank of second lieutenant.

323
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,686
Attention!

324
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,211
Signature: commander of the
detachment Boldyn, general,

325
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,387
political officer Krupitsky, colonel,

326
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,763
testified by the chief of staff.
Protsnal, L7 Lieutenant Colonel.

327
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,273
Lieutenant Mrachnyy, get out of the line.

328
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,608
Well lieutenant, thank you.

329
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,066
Come to me as an aide-de-camp, okay?

330
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,384
There is!

331
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,047
Citizen Colonel...

332
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,685
Okay, okay, sit down, don't make noise.

333
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,551
Have you ever done something like this?

334
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,973
Where?

335
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,805
Don't worry, you'll learn.

336
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,925
But what should I do?

337
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,791
First of all, don't make noise.

338
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,951
Adjutant - the right
hand of the commander.

339
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,671
Do you know where you got to?

340
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,191
Do you know which
person you will be adjutant?

341
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,703
What he says, what he comes up
with - remember everything in
order to repeat it in time.

342
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,232
Orders, assignments.

343
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,194
It is a great honour, but
also a great responsibility.

344
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,966
Understandably?

345
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:10,990
Yes sir!

346
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,911
Briefing the adjutant, Colonel?

347
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,514
Yes, in general...

348
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,631
Leave, I want to rest

349
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,804
I am already leaving.

350
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,890
Good night,

351
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,148
What is your name?

352
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,766
Mechislav.

353
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,754
So Metek.

354
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,548
Do you know why you are here?

355
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,431
What are you, mute?

356
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,031
And you know, it's
good, very good.

357
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,874
Here is just the place for the mute.
The less you talk, the better.

358
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,371
But now say something.

359
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,712
Why are you, new, inexperienced,
and Kholera knows where?

360
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:57,472
That's why it's not from someone old,
not from Protsnal, not from Siebert,
not from anyone, you understand?

361
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,785
Nothing, then you'll understand.

362
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,824
Elka!

363
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,870
Coming soon!

364
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,969
Do you know what is most
important to you right now?

365
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,591
Not papers and any
nonsense, but trust.

366
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,929
If you have trust, everything
else is nonsense; if you lose
it, nothing will help you.

367
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,413
Ah, Mrachnyy!

368
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,554
How are you?

369
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,504
How did you sleep?

370
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,290
Excellent, Comrade General!

371
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,785
Well, what do people say?

372
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,326
Everything is good.

373
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:37,966
Complain a little about the rain.

374
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,991
For the rain! Stupid.

375
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,146
When it rains, planes don't fly.

376
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,671
Metek! Come here.

377
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,647
What's this?

378
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,991
What happened here at night, huh?

379
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,794
I heard screams at night.

380
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,914
Wanted to get in...

381
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,569
What did he shout?

382
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,584
I don't know... Something like "thunder"...

383
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,550
You're probably wrong.

384
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,229
Let's not talk about this.

385
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,464
Listen Metek...

386
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,464
Whatever he does, it's our business,
his and mine, you understand?

387
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,431
Fix the hook, now.

388
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,684
And for the future...

389
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,326
Whatever happens here, don't
break down the doors, okay?

390
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,330
Well, what are you staring at?

391
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,647
Attention!

392
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,092
Citizen General, officers assembled.

393
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,213
Good.

394
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,071
What's next on the agenda today?

395
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,692
The international situation
will be reported by Colonel
Krupitsky, the rest as usual.

396
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,190
Sit down, lads.

397
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,393
Aty, Mrachnyy, keep minutes,
not conversations, only decisions.

398
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,491
Please, Comrade Krupitsky.

399
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,096
In recent months, the international
situation has changed drastically.

400
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:18,176
The German fascists, defeated
at Stalingrad, lost hope of victory.

401
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,736
Since then, their main goal has been
to drag out the course of the War in

402
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,173
the calculation of disagreements
in the anti-Hitler coalition.

403
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,016
Yes! OK then.

404
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,793
What exactly is going
on with us, for example?

405
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,616
On our territory, one can notice the
growing resistance to the invaders.

406
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,416
The partisan movement is expanding

407
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,176
So good.

408
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,191
Have questions?
No.

409
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,296
Well, as we heard, the situation is good.
The Hitler beast swayed,

410
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,256
which means that it is on its feet,
and it is our duty to release so much
blood from it so that it expires.

411
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,634
What, no?

412
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,372
So what's next? Let's go guys quickly.

413
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,336
In the last week,
intelligence reports

414
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,936
indicate a decrease
in traffic to the east.

415
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,936
At the same time, our scouts inform 0 the
appearance of Wehrmacht departments in the

416
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,656
vicinity of Avissa
and to the east of it,

417
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,353
as well as in the vicinity of Malkevichi,

418
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,470
Map.

419
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,376
Here are the Malkevichs.

420
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,496
Are the squads big?

421
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,488
Up to a platoon, 1-2 cars.

422
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,994
And west of Avissa?

423
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,463
What, Comrade General?

424
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,865
Is there less rail traffic too?

425
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,927
Smaller.

426
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,329
Listen, Talalei, this is a
message of paramount importance.

427
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,745
Put all the agents on the
railway traffic in Avissa.

428
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,591
Yes, sir.

429
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,826
Well? What? Will they
touch us before winter?

430
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,951
Siebert, what do you say?

431
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,663
I guess, that...

432
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,514
Former data...

433
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,296
Hmm.

434
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,264
Protsnal,

435
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,727
I don't think... Why would they
attack now. Winter will come,
the marshes will freeze...

436
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,349
Comrade Krupitsky.

437
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,991
I think so too, Comrade General.

438
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,204
What's the point right now?

439
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,973
Rains, swamps got wet
- no way to pass, no way.

440
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,123
Yes... And I say that they are preparing.

441
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,185
In winter?

442
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,009
Now.

443
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,071
Here.

444
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:14,293
Branches appeared in
three points. What the hell?

445
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:20,016
They are looking for apartments,
looking around, where they could

446
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,804
place a company,
or even battalions.

447
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,736
Well! Look at the map, damn it!

448
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,976
Here, from this side they cut us
off from Polissya, here, here...

449
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,656
What are you telling me,
how else will they feel it!

450
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,296
They want to overthrow us.

451
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,296
You are right, Citizen General!

452
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,687
That "you're right"! What do you suggest?

453
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,776
We need to get ready.

454
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,296
Demand to drop the cargo from the air.

455
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,016
Ammunition is bad.

456
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,223
Maybe mortars...

457
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,766
So what? Sitting like in a fortress?

458
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:48,769
Not...

459
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,372
If not, then what?

460
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:56,050
And if they press you so hard that
you can’t stand it, where will you go?

461
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,413
To the East.

462
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,032
And there the largest forces will be
concentrated so as not to let us through.

463
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,823
Krupitsky.

464
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,013
South.

465
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,790
Siebert, say something

466
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,606
To the West.

467
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,351
Aty, Mrachnyy?
Maybe you are a young Napoleon?

468
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,389
On North.

469
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,634
Well, what I said, some Napoleons.

470
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,111
Oscho, stop joking.

471
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,230
Not east, not west,
not north, not south.

472
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,584
I don't know myself.

473
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,292
Now we need to send
reconnaissance in all directions.

474
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,911
Every day 3-4 branches.

475
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,736
And, if possible, for provisions.

476
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:39,409
It's clear?

477
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,368
Yes sir.

478
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,616
What else?

479
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,129
Nothing.

480
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,253
Then go ahead, folks.

481
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,727
This is a catastrophe.
3-4 sections a day...

482
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,614
We torture people, and if something
starts, they won’t be able to move a foot,

483
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,056
So you think it's
out of the question

484
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,764
that we're being crushed now?

485
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,770
Of course. They do not
conduct aerial reconnaissance.

486
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,467
Two weeks ago they were still
spinning around Avissa, and now...

487
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,853
Silence.

488
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,047
After all, they will not climb blindly.

489
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,874
But it was raining.

490
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,072
Today? This kind of weather.

491
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,214
No... I think...

492
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,843
Well, shall we go to dinner?

493
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,633
An hour later, only four more.

494
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,972
Well, see you then, Colonel,
I'll take a walk.

495
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,908
See you. My regards.

496
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,004
Ah, Mrachnyy... What do they say?

497
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,774
Nothing, Comrade General.

498
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,327
Nothing? Even sheep bleat.

499
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,111
Is there anything from Protsnal?

500
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,271
What are the Germans, moving?

501
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,510
From where, Comrade General.
Everything is quiet.

502
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,385
What about the rest?

503
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,971
Everything is good.

504
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,886
So there are no Germans?

505
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,205
That's right, no.

506
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,591
And who yesterday came from the Starogo?

507
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,373
Pine. Report from Avissa.

508
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,464
Army?

509
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,687
Did not see.

510
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,292
Yeah didn't see it. If they had,
they might not have returned.

511
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,696
What people say
in the villages, in

512
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,696
the towns, damn it,
it's so hard to know

513
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,256
because people from the
village go to this Avissa,

514
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,647
See, why don't they say,
they have acquaintances there!

515
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,964
Colonel Protsnal will have to...

516
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,976
I instructed him to send 2-3
squads a day, but what is he!

517
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,753
Where are these offices, your mother!

518
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,176
What are you staring at!

519
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,191
Out, fuck you!

520
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,964
Don't worry, Mrachnyy, he has
those attacks. What are you for?

521
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,852
For you, Comrade Colonel. Because there
is no intelligence plan in the report.

522
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,711
And I, in fact, a plan.

523
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,366
I will report.

524
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,672
God knows, maybe
wait until he lets him in?

525
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,246
No, he's very worried,
I'll go and tell him.

526
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,867
Comrade General, Colonel
Protsnal with a developed plan.

527
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,413
With a plan?

528
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,868
Stop it! Stop it!

529
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,847
Oy baby!

530
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,187
No! No!

531
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,032
Quiet. What happened to you?

532
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,450
Say what it was about.

533
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,789
Protsnal that he did not
write in the report...

534
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,803
What are you telling me!
What happened before this?

535
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,591
What are you, offended?

536
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,591
I said that between us - our business.

537
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,628
He shouts "out", and what are you?

538
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,671
Such a knight.

539
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,790
OK.

540
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,634
Tomorrow, if he screams, leave,
as if nothing had happened, and
not a word, understand?

541
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,251
As if nothing had happened.

542
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,193
Stop! Password!

543
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,032
What are you shaking!

544
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,526
Eat smoking?

545
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,984
Cut short.

546
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,874
It doesn't matter.

547
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,049
No Germans, damn it.

548
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,404
Get pissed off again.

549
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,332
I don't know what to do any more.

550
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,526
Ha, listen to what Wolf writes:

551
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,611
"We are in Topolany. Quietly.
We requisitioned potatoes, three carts..."

552
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,889
After all, there must have been Germans.

553
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,793
Yes, nonsense.

554
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,231
Or maybe come up with something?

555
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,344
What to think?

556
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,107
Well, in the reports...

557
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,667
I don't understand what...

558
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,185
What is it? To hell?

559
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,693
Tes!

560
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,651
What happened, Dark One?

561
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,970
Comrade Lieutenant Colonel,
I ask the general.

562
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,905
Well, eagles, how are the Fritz?
Are they moving?

563
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,264
Yes, Citizen General.

564
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,426
Then order. Where?

565
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,567
Based on the testimony of the villagers,
they did not have time to write it down.

566
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:43,710
Well.

567
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,530
Moved around Avissa.

568
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,145
Again, three trains left for
the east, and no less arrived.

569
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,732
Talalei reported that
people saw new units.

570
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:54,953
Well, please. Who would have thought!

571
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,776
In the brigade of Stary, a German
truck was seen near the village

572
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,349
of Topolyany, which drove off
before they could open fire on it.

573
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,470
Mrachnyy!

574
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,590
I'm listening!

575
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,496
Or to the commanders, in
half an hour. my collection.

576
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,016
There is!

577
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:05,552
Wait.

578
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:09,194
And you, Protsnal, go to your
place and bring all the data.

579
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,225
Yes, sir!

580
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:14,871
Mrachnyy, well, didn't I say?

581
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,216
Wait, wait,
then everything will be revealed.

582
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,992
They didn't believe me, fools!

583
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,653
What do you think?

584
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,088
The boys say that we sit
quietly for too long, it's boring.

585
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,136
That's right, Mrachnyy,
we've been sitting too long!

586
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,730
Well, go ahead, organise.

587
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,673
Now it will start

588
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,610
The health of our general!

589
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,506
On the Germans! Lead us to the Germans!

590
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,489
The general quickly
revealed the Swabian plans!

591
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,671
Our general foresees everything!

592
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,385
Well, let's drink, lads!

593
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,732
Fly in.

594
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,585
Because the general foresees everything.

595
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,954
You see, Mrachnyy, what
excellent officers I have.

596
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,954
They already take my word for it.

597
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,431
And how was it over Yaselda, lads?

598
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,976
You, Mrachnyy, think that I was always
so great, that I was appointed, that

599
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,976
I graduated from
different schools,

600
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,256
climbed into the
bosses without Vaseline?

601
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,136
But no! I appointed myself!

602
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,753
What, no, lads?

603
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,250
He joined the detachment near Kobrin,
then there were not even twenty people.

604
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,136
At that time we did not really
know what to do, but there was

605
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,151
a first-class commander, Comrade
Vinetsky, of blessed memory...

606
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,324
Well, lads, for Vinetsky!
Mrachnyy, drink up.

607
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,203
Elka, ammunition!

608
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,770
Does Elka have ammunition, huh?
But not for everyone.

609
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,646
Fool.

610
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,848
If I wanted to, then I would have
coped with everyone, everyone.

611
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,853
Don't trust?

612
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,611
That's what I would do,
and that's all for him.

613
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,531
Are you afraid?

614
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:18,964
If I said that you pinched me, he would
have chopped you into cabbage here.

615
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,991
Elka, give me this vodka.

616
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,287
To whom is Elka,
and to whom is the general's wife.

617
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,607
Take three.

618
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,591
He was a good guy.
Politically savvy.

619
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,211
When we got him, things went smoothly.

620
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,592
We spun the rails because
we didn't have dynamite yet.

621
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,804
Suddenly, a train whistles on the bridge.
Terrible, like a house upside down.

622
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,572
Elka, what were you doing there, huh?

623
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,091
Go you!

624
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:10,536
Two wagons flew off the rails, the
rest of the wagons poured out, all with

625
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:14,016
rifles, machine guns,
even mortars.

626
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:15,485
Well we run

627
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,776
The Germans are behind
us, but we can’t really run,

628
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,791
legs sink to the knee.

629
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,571
There's a volley!

630
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,536
We fall into this swamp,
we lie, we lie...

631
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,296
I want to get up but I can't.

632
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,656
Vinetsky.

633
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,656
I can't move it with my hand.

634
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,034
Look, he has...

635
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,714
In a word, half the head seemed
to be chopped off with a cleaver.

636
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,753
I shout: "Boys, lads.
And the boys are already gone.

637
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,266
So what should I have done?
Carry a corpse on your shoulders?

638
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,234
Well, lads...
For the memory of Comrade Vinetsky,

639
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,834
without which there would
be no Boldyn in the world.

640
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,804
May his memory live on

641
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:27,249
I caught up with our brotherhood, and
they told me: "Postpone Comrade Vinetsky?"

642
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:30,407
And look at me like wolves.

643
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,729
And the worst of all is the Dark One.

644
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,776
"What are you staring at me
for," I say to him, and - for SHSH.

645
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,826
And he: "Dog under your tail P".
This is for me, you know!

646
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,616
Yes, you went! What should I have done!

647
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,074
Through the swamp, on the shoulders?

648
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,614
Where have you been, dog?

649
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,909
They dumped themselves, and I had to drag?

650
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,088
Well? Am I right guys?

651
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:55,288
Well!

652
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,591
I'm right? Why are you silent?

653
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:02,447
You were right, General, by God,
there is nothing to worry about.

654
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,176
We were stupid, and you, General...

655
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,626
See, preacher, that's when
your word would come in handy.

656
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,376
You must know, Mrachnyy, that
Protsnal was already great then, oh!

657
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,404
I'm not, I'm a simple
man and he is zero, brother!

658
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,833
He was already an intellectual then.

659
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,332
Leave him alone!

660
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,745
You listen, Mrachnyy, I'm telling you.

661
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,293
They know it by heart, they
don't want to listen to it any more.

662
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,816
So, I told him: "Close your mouth!"

663
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,673
"And anyway, why are you lying
here belly up? Get up and go ahead!"

664
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,524
And you should know that the
lads were exhausted, they did
not sleep the whole night.

665
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,031
And then one, the
other on me to push out.

666
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,431
But I, General, because I...

667
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,936
Well, yes, okay, I admit...

668
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,256
Protsnal stopped them, said:
"Boys, he's right"

669
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,988
Well, imagine, Mrachnyy, it helped.

670
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,256
We go through the swamps, we reach Yaselda.

671
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,023
Burnt house. The lads are lying
in the corners like herrings,
and are already snoring.

672
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,550
I look - Yaselda
is wide, spilled...

673
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,972
Finish. Sleep!

674
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,176
Babs are always like this, in a brazen way.

675
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,646
The guys sit quietly for themselves,
and the woman scandalises,

676
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,670
Elka, where!

677
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,552
Mrachnyy, what are you looking at,
the glasses are dry.

678
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,696
Well... I stand in front of
the hut, I want to cry,

679
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,936
I look - Protsnal, I'm going to him.

680
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,696
"Guy, we need to take that one,
otherwise the partisans over
Yaselda will be finished, period."

681
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:33,088
I wake one, he hums,
does not open his eyes.

682
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,536
Protsnal shouts: "Comrades!"

683
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,456
"In the interests of the working class and
the worldwide revolutionary movement..."

684
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:41,456
Well. very right, you know...

685
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,976
Even "under the banner of Marx,
Engels, Lenin and Stalin..."

686
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,136
The boys are sleeping! Kholera.
There is no other way out -
you need them with water.

687
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,913
Well, look what
happened, I find a bucket...

688
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,053
Get up, damn it!
Collection, and to the other side!

689
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:09,452
Don't listen!
He will break off to order!

690
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,373
Get up!

691
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,373
Don't get up!

692
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,648
Shut up! Are you getting up or not?

693
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,384
But the fact that?

694
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:22,349
Become!

695
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,685
Well lads...

696
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,246
Not a minute more. Shoot down
the rafts, and to the other side.

697
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,324
Who will delay...

698
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,745
What, Mrachnyy, do you think that's it?

699
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,326
Hell no.

700
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,033
There, behind Yaselda,
that's where the fear is.

701
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,007
But what?

702
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:04,272
I'm not afraid the Germans
will come, I'm afraid they won't.

703
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,529
Suddenly I hear - an aeroplane, and
on the other side about a hundred
guys are climbing the beams.

704
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,449
I say to the boys: "Well,
what would you look like now?"

705
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,168
And they say: "The right decision,
Comrade Commander."

706
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,404
Commander, you understand?

707
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,145
Well, talked you to death.
Bye! Need sleep.

708
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,823
Mrachnyy! Close.

709
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,231
All right, General, let's go!

710
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,206
Who is in Avissa?

711
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,612
As usual. Police, gendarmerie.

712
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,505
Army?

713
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,791
Comrade General, he examined
everything, there is no army.

714
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,592
Like this? And what did
Protsnal fill me with?

715
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:51,693
There is an army!

716
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,670
Where?

717
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,271
On the bridge. They built
bunkers on one side and the other.

718
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,390
Have you tried them?

719
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,431
God forbid, just observation

720
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,544
In a place?

721
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:05,087
Not in town, really. Maybe only
at the station, we didn’t get there.

722
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,874
Talalei, what's at the station?

723
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,468
Security, maybe a platoon.

724
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,930
So why did we bring so
many people? Protsnal?

725
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,376
The army doesn't come to sit still

726
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,028
Yesterday was, today they could transfer.

727
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,491
What do you suggest?

728
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:22,027
According to the plan, attack.

729
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,230
Bridge?

730
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:26,150
Maybe a bridge. But there is a crossing.

731
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:29,231
Good. Starogo!

732
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,885
You and your crew on the boats.

733
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,584
Zelenets will cover from
the side of the bridge.

734
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,551
Okhorovich's brigade remains on this side.

735
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,949
And will keep in touch with Zelenets.

736
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,111
Protsnal commands everything on this shore.

737
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,849
Wolf!

738
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:48,126
Listen, Comrade General!

739
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,591
You go to the station and take the station.

740
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,785
Meanwhile, the Starogo One will
clean up the place.

741
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,151
Ivanov!

742
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,190
I'm listening!

743
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,256
You go with the Wolf, as soon as you take
the station, lay mines, and - into the air.

744
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,250
Signalling and arrows too. It's clear?

745
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,111
Yes sir!

746
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,247
Order, follow.

747
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,709
March!

748
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,029
Weird. Talalei,
take me to some hut.

749
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:56,310
What kind of huts are
these, for the general himself!

750
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,311
Is there any tavern?
Something to eat?

751
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,032
There is.

752
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,150
Well, go ahead, brother.

753
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,789
Who's there?

754
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,909
Police! Kwiatkowski, open up.

755
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,092
Open up.

756
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,326
Sir Commandant?

757
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,471
Fool, it's the general himself.

758
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:23,689
Sir General!

759
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,214
So, Mr. Kwiatkowski,
what's going on here?

760
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:42,491
Thank you, sir General, everything is fine.

761
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,993
Somehow, a little...

762
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,191
What, under the Germans?

763
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,214
Hey you, Kwiatkowski,
we know everything about you.

764
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,367
Tell me which of the Germans are in Avissa?

765
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,336
Well, what are you, sir officer,
what again?

766
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,887
Who can say something about me?
I am clean as a tear.

767
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,531
With the Germans? Not for any money!

768
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,110
Good good. Is there some
kind of army, where is it?

769
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:11,330
In the town? No army!
At the train station, maybe?

770
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:12,345
On the bridge.

771
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:15,728
O! Of course,
there is some kind of watch...

772
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:21,416
Leave it, Talalei. Sir Kwiatkowski
is a wise man, and knows that it is

773
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,568
better to live in
harmony with us?

774
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,030
That's right, Sir General!

775
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,134
It is such an honour for me -
Sir General Boldyn himself!

776
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:34,728
Sit down, Sir Kwiatkowski.

777
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,145
Well, what about the army, the Germans?

778
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,591
No, sir general, I give you my word.

779
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:45,026
And were?

780
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,505
No, they weren't. No army.

781
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:50,830
And when...

782
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:57,776
A few days ago, we unloaded at the railway
station, and then drove through the city

783
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,394
in lorries in the
direction of Topolyan.

784
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,809
And who spun this to sir General!

785
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,831
Someone who will get away with it!

786
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,908
Well, your health,
Sir Kwiatkovsky!

787
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,966
Nonsense. The old one takes the policemen.

788
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:26,104
Quiet!

789
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,591
It must have been the Wolf
who reached the station.

790
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,487
Comrade General, mission accomplished,

791
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:44,425
Police?

792
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,174
Yes sir.

793
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,226
Losses?

794
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,003
No.

795
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,854
And the Germans?

796
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:50,553
Twelve were killed, two escaped.

797
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,854
Local?

798
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,405
One is wounded.

799
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:56,550
Not bad.

800
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,349
Hell, how do you teach
them to take the language?

801
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:00,546
Stock?

802
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,405
Flour, porridge.
The boys are loaded onto carts.

803
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,273
Order. Eat something.

804
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,468
Mrachnyy, pour it.

805
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,104
Ivanov.

806
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,413
Set the heat.

807
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,825
Probably got a warehouse with
ammunition, too strong an explosion.

808
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:43,884
Maybe there are Germans there? There
probably is, but my bold intelligence...

809
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,110
Mortars!

810
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,332
There must be something...

811
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,874
Mrachnyy, look what's going on there,
and if something happens, signal.

812
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,649
I will!

813
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,493
What's happening?

814
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:11,169
The Germans are falling!

815
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:11,786
What are the Germans?

816
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,773
Lots, a whole train!

817
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,512
Where is the wolf?

818
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,932
Kholera knows him! Gasuy!

819
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,809
Comrade General, we must go!
A whole train of Germans at the
station, they are attacking!

820
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,671
Comrade General,
the squad has been dispersed!

821
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,471
Well, Mr. Kwiatkowski...

822
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:27,772
So I won't drink tea. It's a pity.

823
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,088
Thanks for the meal.

824
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,812
Come visit us sometime and
have something to eat. Good?

825
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,185
Starogo man, block the street for a
quarter of an hour. And in which
case, retreat to the crossing, okay?

826
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,407
Krupitsky, take the squad
from the bridge, cover it.

827
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,254
I understand!

828
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,976
Talalei, and you, dear, go to the station,
this one could mess something up.

829
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,389
If it's serious, give me a rocket.
What is your?

830
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:06,288
Yellow.

831
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:07,111
Order. Forward.

832
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,648
Rule five hundred metres below!

833
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,548
Mrachnyy, run to the Starogo, let him
immediately return to us. Already!

834
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,047
What's with Wolf?

835
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:07,747
There is no it, cut off, probably!

836
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,616
Damn you! Maybe they will
come back, they have a whole night,

837
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,404
If they get to the shore,
they will already be found.

838
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:13,851
What about swimming across the river?

839
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:19,936
Ah, of course. You know what,
take five people and wait on the
shore with the boats. Wait, okay?

840
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:20,893
The Germans will raid.

841
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:23,549
Wait, he said, clear Kholera! Report!

842
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:24,289
There is!

843
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,292
Wash up. Eat something, don't worry

844
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,791
Son of a bitch.

845
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,191
Wolf and his twenty men are gone.

846
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:58,183
Wolf himself, Chechot, all old friends.

847
01:04:58,800 --> 01:04:59,744
Killed?

848
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,791
Kholera knows what's wrong with them.

849
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,964
Were there Germans?

850
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,332
That's right, they weren't!

851
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:09,536
When I found out about this,
I left two brigades on this side,

852
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,632
because what kind of Kholera was
it to drag them to the other side?

853
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,431
I went on my own, with the Starogo One.

854
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,051
And got ambushed?

855
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,047
Like chicks,

856
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,612
son of a bitch!

857
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:22,870
Talek?

858
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,143
Well no.

859
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,576
Who told me that the Germans are in Avissa?

860
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,750
No, Talyus is good too.

861
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:31,816
Protsnal believed that there
were Germans, but Talyus did not

862
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,286
say a word that it was a linden.

863
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,073
And so many people were killed

864
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,025
Kholera is clear,
I am this son of a bitch!

865
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,624
Here, have a drink.

866
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:10,852
You're right.

867
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:13,444
For the Wolf and for Chechot!

868
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:20,893
Mrachnyy.

869
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,231
You go to the officers, tell
them to come at three zero-zero.

870
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,951
Comrade General, Captain Siebert.

871
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,772
Sit down.

872
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:38,887
So so...

873
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,286
Mrachnyy!

874
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,645
Please. The colonel only
asks for Colonel Krupitsky.

875
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:21,029
Mrachnyy!

876
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:24,504
Invite Vanadek.

877
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:25,584
Yes, sir!

878
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:32,431
Major!

879
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,664
General asks.

880
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,444
Everything, Kholera, was dumped on me.

881
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,404
Didn't write the word.

882
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,049
Damn Protsnal got his revenge
on me, you son of a bitch.

883
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,951
I haven't spoken to Protsnal yet.

884
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:51,886
No?

885
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,931
Cannot be,

886
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:02,967
Colonel!

887
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:04,664
General asks.

888
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:23,391
So, Protsnal.

889
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,111
During the night,
the detachment suffered losses.

890
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:30,896
The Cape comrades analysed the
situation, and unanimously decided

891
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,150
that you are
responsible for this.

892
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,292
Well?

893
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:37,830
Do you want to say something?

894
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,253
Or maybe you do not
agree with this assessment?

895
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,012
Agree.

896
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,812
I'm happy.

897
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,252
Comrade Krupitsky will present
the details of the discussion.

898
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:57,216
For some time Lieutenant Colonel
Protsnal exaggerated various rumours

899
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,551
about the presence of the German
army on the periphery of our territory.

900
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:04,564
The command decided to
pre-empt the attack of the enemy...

901
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,631
Decided correctly?

902
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,052
True, if the information were correct.

903
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:10,064
Okay, let's move on.

904
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,336
Since tactical reconnaissance showed
the absence of an army in Avissa,

905
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,966
it was attacked by a small force.

906
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:24,504
Therefore, the appearance of
random transport caught by
surprise and led to losses.

907
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,784
What do you offer?

908
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,030
What about Protsnal?

909
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,689
He must be held accountable.

910
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:35,807
For example?

911
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,552
Cannot remain in the
position of chief of staff.

912
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:43,953
Agree.

913
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:46,568
Vanadek, write the order.

914
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:25,451
This is us for yesterday.

915
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:43,085
The same day after day.

916
01:10:43,960 --> 01:10:44,984
Okay, Elka.

917
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:49,653
When the war is over, I will take
you to Bialystok, and there I will
take you to the best restaurant.

918
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:52,336
And please, whatever you want -

919
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,656
steak so steak,
liver so liver, please.

920
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:56,387
Even baked chicken!

921
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:01,748
Well! You see, Mrachnyy,
what it's like with women!

922
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:04,267
Your lucky that you are not married.

923
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:05,833
But you've been married for three.

924
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,951
Okay, okay, what, you can't joke?

925
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:10,728
You picked a good time for jokes.

926
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,166
Elka!

927
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,783
Is your butt itchy?
Do you want to receive?

928
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,367
You have already received.
Now you distribute to yours.

929
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:24,856
Elka, you know
perfectly well that Protsnal

930
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,188
screwed up, just as
you know, as I do...

931
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,270
Both of you messed up.

932
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:28,384
Shut up!

933
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:31,070
What's there!

934
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,193
Comrade General,
there is something about Protsnal,

935
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:44,824
Had contacts.

936
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:45,768
With whom?

937
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,727
I've been to the Starogo One twice.

938
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:49,390
Complained.

939
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:50,749
For injustice?

940
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:51,830
Not only.

941
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:57,029
Inaction, errors in intelligence.
The Germans did not even think
about the offensive.

942
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:01,486
Cattle. Who reported to me?
And what's Starogo on it?

943
01:12:01,640 --> 01:12:02,311
Silent.

944
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:03,248
Silent!

945
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:05,456
Knows what will fly next!

946
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:06,652
What else?

947
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,776
Calm down, not stupid lad, he
sees what is happening here.

948
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:13,791
Aty, Mrachnyy, listen and learn.

949
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:14,944
What else?

950
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,513
Protsnal expressed the opinion...

951
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,294
Well!

952
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,550
06 command errors.

953
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:21,573
Shit.

954
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,567
Things to think about...

955
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:27,425
What?

956
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:28,334
Gain.

957
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,572
What the hell!

958
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,188
Commands.

959
01:12:33,240 --> 01:12:35,652
Are you talking to me now, Kholera?

960
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,136
Siebert, don't think that
you're so indispensable,

961
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,084
if anything, you yourself will
go to such and such a mother!

962
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,751
There is written evidence, General.

963
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:55,110
Well, Krupa, you will get Protsnal,

964
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,005
Krupitsky, Comrade General.

965
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:00,608
All right, Krupitsky.
As we say...

966
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,736
A fish is a cancer, Kandyba is a fool,
cancer is a fish, a fool is Kandyba,

967
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,616
one way or another,
Kandyba is a fool.

968
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:10,928
Yes, Krupa... Ugh, Krupitsky!

969
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,810
What, you don't believe me?

970
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,364
Nah, read it.

971
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,147
Well, now you see what kind of bird it is?

972
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,976
Conducts campaigning.

973
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,991
Undermines the authority of the command.

974
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,844
The question is,
what to do with this shit?

975
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,169
You're on political issues,
so come on boldly.

976
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,307
Am I right, Siebert?

977
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:38,865
Yes.

978
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,093
I thought it was a fool with ambition...

979
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,671
And this is a saboteur, clear Kholera!

980
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,053
In Avissa he led us to the Germans!

981
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,074
Killed my people

982
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:56,084
I ask you: is this a coincidence?

983
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,648
I know Protsnal less than you,
I met him only here.

984
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,424
However, we know that he was
sent by the party even before Vinetsky.

985
01:14:06,120 --> 01:14:07,485
Party, you say?

986
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,812
Do you know how many
provocations there were in the party?

987
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,571
I know that there were

988
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,136
But the one whom the party sends to
the forest, like this, immediately
write down as provocateurs...

989
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,605
No, Comrade General.

990
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:21,512
So, angel?

991
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,304
Well, not an angel.
But to immediately agent...

992
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,087
So.

993
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,485
Well...
We don't understand each other,
Commissar,

994
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,831
We don't have mutual understanding.

995
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,406
Well, Protsnal, remember, I said
that it is not good to be conceited?

996
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,546
But you still become conceited,
clear Kholera.

997
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,528
Offended by the command, right?

998
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,265
Speak now,
otherwise I'll cut it into flasks!

999
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,391
However, I've been talking

1000
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:38,025
Colonel Krupitsky, be kind enough
to conduct an inquiry yourself.

1001
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:46,987
Citizen Protsnal, it has come
to our attention that you carried
out agitation against the command.

1002
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:48,491
This is true?

1003
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:50,305
Not true.

1004
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,027
And if I present witnesses
to you, then what?

1005
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,110
General...

1006
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:59,467
Do you think the command is bad, because
you needlessly attacked Avissa, yes or no?

1007
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:01,144
No.

1008
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:03,612
That is...

1009
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:04,812
Yes or no?

1010
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,233
Did you say something similar?

1011
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,748
This is not entirely true.

1012
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:13,748
But did they say? For whom?

1013
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:17,510
Well.

1014
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,751
Remembered?

1015
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,647
With whom?

1016
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,464
With dog shit,

1017
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:29,187
Oh you brute!
You 
scoff, and people to death!

1018
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,005
You know what I'll tell you...
Your chatter is up to my ass.

1019
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,847
But I lost the best
division because of you.

1020
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,816
Starogo comrade Wolf, perhaps
already in the next world,

1021
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,127
I won't forgive you, you bastard!

1022
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,925
Groats! Protsnal the saboteur - on trial!

1023
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:53,831
Mrachnyy, write the order.

1024
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,814
For sabotage activities to
judge Protsnal by a military court.

1025
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:01,974
Consisting of: Colonel
Krupitsky - Chairman,

1026
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,411
Captain Siebert and Captain Ivanov - assessors,

1027
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:06,693
Everything.

1028
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:38,652
Go to hell! Fell asleep a little,
put on a show all night.

1029
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,266
I know...

1030
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:39,976
Damn, what do you know!

1031
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:40,785
Captain Siebert...

1032
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,166
Go away!

1033
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,129
When he wakes up, tell me
that I came. We start at 9:00.

1034
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:53,704
Alias?

1035
01:17:58,440 --> 01:17:59,384
Alias?

1036
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,111
Don't understand what you are being told?

1037
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,304
Protsnal,

1038
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,446
Date and place of birth?

1039
01:18:10,040 --> 01:18:13,647
24th November 1910, Pruzhany,

1040
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,330
Since what time in the woods?

1041
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:20,530
Sago,.

1042
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:25,427
Do you think it's so easy, one or
two, and a person to the next world?

1043
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:32,849
Listen, when I took over the
department after Vinetsky, the
whole staff was me and him.

1044
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:38,546
Once we sent Talalei
to the village for food.

1045
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,496
We are waiting for an hour,
another - it is not.

1046
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:45,856
Well, Protsnal to me: "It was
not necessary to send without
familiarisation with the weapon,"

1047
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:50,416
"the army is a serious matter",
"training", and training, training...

1048
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:54,856
And I don’t answer at all, because
which of me is a warrior, with a

1049
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,474
department without
a year a week...

1050
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:02,176
At school, too, I don’t remember
- five, maybe four departments...

1051
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,270
Quiet!

1052
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,594
No, nobody.

1053
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:07,376
It seemed.

1054
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:12,224
So we are sitting in the bushes,
waiting, but Talaleika is not there.

1055
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,016
Then Protsnal says to me:
"Maybe they were captured?"

1056
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,456
Oh, Kholera, so that's what you think!

1057
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:25,123
"Well, wake up people, Protsnal!"
Understood? "Protsnal", without
any "comrade" there.

1058
01:19:25,920 --> 01:19:29,136
So, we go to the village, we look -

1059
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,736
and windows, screams,
songs shine at the mill.

1060
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:38,346
Protsnal says: "So, it's probably the
Germans and the policemen celebrating."

1061
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:42,232
Oh, Kholera, I think.

1062
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,713
Maybe you're right, pig...

1063
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:57,307
What is happening there?

1064
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:03,024
Mother of God! Waiting
to see with my own eyes!

1065
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:04,207
Who's there?

1066
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:08,524
We are celebrating, Boldyn's messengers
have come, and we are celebrating!

1067
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,671
So those are from Boldyn, right?

1068
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:13,108
Over there!

1069
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:40,008
And here is our favourite commander!

1070
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,525
General Boldyn!

1071
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,129
People! Long live!

1072
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,267
Wait a minute!

1073
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,585
This is from the contact,
and this is from the general.

1074
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:58,790
Protsnal!

1075
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:02,005
Set up posts in the village,
and this one under arrest,

1076
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:03,093
Yes, sir!

1077
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:14,583
Well, people, thank you for the
hospitable welcome of my army.

1078
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,591
Because we are your army.

1079
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,031
We are here to protect you

1080
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:28,266
We ask the noble general,
not to disdain the peasant treat.

1081
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:37,444
One hundred years,
one hundred years let us live!

1082
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,911
General, order fulfilled!

1083
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:59,613
And this one addresses me as
"general", understand? "General".

1084
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,170
Well, now Protsnal is a saboteur.

1085
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,911
They will give him a tower,
how to give him a drink,

1086
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,445
Otherwise it cannot be.

1087
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:15,616
No, I know you're thinking:
"Don't be a fool, Boldyn"

1088
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:20,703
"to hell with all this court, return
Protsnal, and peace in the house," right?

1089
01:22:22,040 --> 01:22:25,487
But you see, if you give your word,
that word no longer depends on you.

1090
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,696
I didn't come up with this,
damn it, I'll change it.

1091
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,528
Quiet!

1092
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:31,045
General! General!

1093
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,554
What? What do you want?

1094
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:33,874
General Wolf!

1095
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:35,229
What is a wolf?

1096
01:22:35,360 --> 01:22:36,646
Came with a branch!

1097
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:42,068
Mrachnyy, quickly to Krupa! To
hell with this court, your mother!

1098
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,576
Okay, okay, guys, sit down!

1099
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,705
Come on, put on more!

1100
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,228
I report, comrade teneral. It
was more likely not to come.

1101
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,850
Oh. .  oh you horse!

1102
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,070
Well, sit down, sit
down, Wolf, wind up!

1103
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:15,056
When the Germans licked us in Avissa,
we went out of the bushes out of the city.

1104
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,976
To continue like this, there, I
thought, it would be empty. But
even there they were waiting for us.

1105
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,650
What was to be done?
We go to the woods.

1106
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,171
Eat, eat, it will get cold!

1107
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:27,416
They also tried to pass under Poplars, in
Kuryany, and each time they were ambushed.

1108
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:34,506
Then we went around to the north.
We slept during the day, and at
night - a throw of 20-30 km.

1109
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,366
It looks like, Comrade General, that
the Germans are trying to surround us,

1110
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,145
Intelligence let it down. The Germans
have gathered garrisons around us.

1111
01:23:44,720 --> 01:23:48,816
I don't know what kind of tasks
Talalei gives to these intelligence aces.

1112
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:50,945
From him such Sherlock Holmes,
as from me a bishop.

1113
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:54,828
What are the losses?

1114
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,407
Five killed. He left three
seriously wounded at the mill.

1115
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,086
Where is Krupitsky?

1116
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:08,808
There is an order to
stop the court session!

1117
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,412
Here are Topolyans,
here are tall Kuryans...

1118
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,507
Mrachnyy...

1119
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:38,413
It's hard for us right now...

1120
01:24:40,480 --> 01:24:42,767
I don't know what I should do.

1121
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:47,891
Maybe ask Comrade Vinetsky?

1122
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:51,924
What do you think?

1123
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,913
What am I saying, after all, comrade
Vinetsky has long been dead...

1124
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,431
I messed up.

1125
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:54,207
Comrade General, allow me to
report. The brigade is ready
to receive cargo from the air.

1126
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,112
Order, Starogo.

1127
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,465
Well, Comrade Krupa.

1128
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,751
Krupitsky, Comrade General.

1129
01:26:06,120 --> 01:26:07,776
All right, Krupitsky.

1130
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,689
What do you think they'll give us?

1131
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,172
We made an order: TNT, ammunition...

1132
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:15,647
And if they play a trick on us,
and you will be served first of all?

1133
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,030
What?

1134
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,925
If they send a whole
plane of political literature?

1135
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:23,608
They seem to be flying.

1136
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:30,176
Eh, if it had flown in from two
hundred planes, large ones,
they would have landed...

1137
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,328
And two hundred tanks.

1138
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:37,432
Once - and our Avissa, once - and our
Bialystok! And then - to Warsaw!

1139
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,426
That's right, General.

1140
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,591
Vanadek, why are you silent?

1141
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,616
That's right, Comrade General,

1142
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,153
If we had something...

1143
01:26:47,200 --> 01:26:51,376
If we don't have it, we'll get it.
Now prepare the plan for
Operation Avissa-Bialystok.

1144
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,073
Should be ready in three days.

1145
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:55,107
Yes, Comrade General.

1146
01:26:55,240 --> 01:26:56,184
Here!

1147
01:27:58,920 --> 01:28:03,448
Well, Mrachnyy, we'll show them some more!

1148
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,125
A couple of wedges,
a couple of cannons,
and how to get in!

1149
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,831
They will only stay in paradise.

1150
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:31,926
Kholera, as in the garbage,
no strength. Fill the watering can...

1151
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,443
Couldn't watch, Mrachnyy?

1152
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:40,090
Metek!

1153
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:45,351
Can't you see what's happening to him?

1154
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:48,591
Did you hear anything this night?

1155
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,254
Did not sleep?

1156
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,068
I thought he would kill, shoot.

1157
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,527
For what?

1158
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,085
The same as usual.

1159
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:02,696
And what do you mean,
I received an order - I carried out the

1160
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,028
order, the rest is nonsense.

1161
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:06,631
And no one gives him orders.

1162
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,016
If only they understood it.
He is a little alive, and you add.

1163
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,336
They will come, as if with a report,
they will report something to him,

1164
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,408
and then it starts...

1165
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:21,244
Ah, Kholera with you,
it seemed reasonable...

1166
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,911
What, they don't exist yet?

1167
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:29,831
It's still early, General,
only seven o'clock.

1168
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:34,130
So you don’t heat the oven,
what are you waiting for?

1169
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,070
The collected cargo is
distributed among the departments.

1170
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:52,271
Ammunition has been replenished.

1171
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,308
Ivanov blew up a train east of Avissa,

1172
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:59,012
Stary's brigade
made a sortie for food.

1173
01:29:59,800 --> 01:30:01,894
Five hundred measures
of flour were obtained.

1174
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,193
Yes, it's all good.

1175
01:30:06,240 --> 01:30:10,211
But I think we are making a big
mistake by sitting like badgers in a hole.

1176
01:30:12,200 --> 01:30:16,910
How far from us to Kovel?
250 km. Atam is already ours.

1177
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,136
So, if the Germans had been hit
hard here, they would have broken their

1178
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:20,889
defences and
forced them to retreat.

1179
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:24,232
Why are you looking at me like that?

1180
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,536
Do you think Boldyn has gone mad?

1181
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:27,971
Don't wait!

1182
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:28,928
Comrade General...

1183
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:31,256
I said that it is necessary to prepare a
plan for the Avissa-Bialystok operation.

1184
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,214
Spoke? Where is this plan?

1185
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:34,873
You spoke three days later.

1186
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:37,265
And it's already been five.
What, you can't count?

1187
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:40,569
How, Comrade General!
The order was yesterday!

1188
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:42,645
Immediately after dropping the load.

1189
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,144
What are you weaving?
When did you drop the load?

1190
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,106
Yesterday.

1191
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:04,667
In two days it will be done, general,

1192
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,287
OK then. Enough for today. Go work.

1193
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:10,751
I'm tired, I need to rest,

1194
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,834
Mrachnyy.

1195
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:28,513
How is it, they really dropped the
load yesterday? Or did you agree?

1196
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:35,249
General, you can ask anyone you want,
for example, Comrade Elka, or a sentry...

1197
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:39,765
What do you advise me, asshole!
To think that the commander is crazy?

1198
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,784
General, I'm just
here to remind you.

1199
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:49,567
The Comrade General gave the order, they
left, then there was still canned meat...

1200
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:51,007
Ah, yes.

1201
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:58,145
Of course you are right. Damn
you. Well, yes, I remember! We
drank alcohol from the cargo.

1202
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:03,932
Today I have heartburn, so yesterday
they drank, since today I have heartburn.

1203
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:10,787
You know?

1204
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:13,370
Fly for Vanadek,

1205
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,696
I gave him general instructions, but
now I've thought about it, and I want

1206
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:20,452
to give him
detailed instructions.

1207
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,274
You see...

1208
01:32:24,240 --> 01:32:27,028
Who will cover the operation from Warsaw?

1209
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,491
And there the Germans
will hold on tight, to be sure.

1210
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,176
Znzstoy, you can never speak

1211
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,191
badly about command,
even if it is wrong.

1212
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,852
War is war, not a
meeting for discussion.

1213
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:42,152
After all, this is an outstanding
military man, a real talent.

1214
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,574
Such a folk gem.

1215
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:49,730
Only if you believe too
much in your infallibility...

1216
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:53,071
Especially those strange statements...

1217
01:32:54,080 --> 01:32:55,753
So what to do, Comrade Colonel?

1218
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,874
Maybe to Greenfeld?

1219
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:00,534
Neither Greenfeld nor
anyone else are psychiatrists.

1220
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:05,483
Do you know what it can lead to?

1221
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,193
And now we can't remove it.

1222
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:15,456
So, Mrachnyy, now a
difficult task awaits you,

1223
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:20,691
We must do everything so that
Boldyn's authority remains inviolable,

1224
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:24,125
But what about Bialystok?

1225
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:26,972
Vanadek will report tomorrow what to do.

1226
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:27,968
Plan?

1227
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,332
Of course.

1228
01:33:29,640 --> 01:33:30,744
But this is madness!

1229
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,649
It's a long road from
planning to implementation.

1230
01:33:35,160 --> 01:33:38,209
We cannot now
openly submit to him.

1231
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:42,553
Okay, go already. Follow him, and
no stupidities. Not a single step.

1232
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:56,111
Where are you, Dark One?

1233
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:00,008
Nobody here. You are not, Elka is not.

1234
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:04,249
She's probably in the dispensary,
Greenfeld sent for her.

1235
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:06,990
That's good, let it work a little.

1236
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:09,667
She has a rotten life with me...

1237
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:13,031
Well, what are we going to do?

1238
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:16,043
Give orders, Citizen General.

1239
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:17,856
Command, command!

1240
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:21,327
I thought you would advise
me something, and you "order"

1241
01:34:23,160 --> 01:34:25,151
Maybe go to the departments?

1242
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,951
It's probably lunch now, Comrade General.

1243
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,024
It's good!

1244
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,148
Let's go and see what the
partisan brethren are fed!

1245
01:34:41,440 --> 01:34:42,589
Again this mess!

1246
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,493
Damn those frozen potatoes...

1247
01:34:46,600 --> 01:34:47,704
Give Dulevich, let him eat.

1248
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,831
What about bread?
Will they give me some bread?

1249
01:34:49,960 --> 01:34:52,406
Will give as soon as possible.

1250
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,491
Well, according to an old
acquaintance, pour me this gruel too.

1251
01:34:57,640 --> 01:34:58,710
I will!

1252
01:34:58,920 --> 01:35:00,547
Give someone a bowler hat

1253
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,889
I didn't come here for the parade.
Sit down, damn it!

1254
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:08,151
What, give me a bowler hat,
or so Nivore, Chive?

1255
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,049
Dip, lads!

1256
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:28,989
Yes, these are not flasks
at Leyzor in Bialystok...

1257
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,704
Were any of you there?

1258
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,228
I was Comrade General.

1259
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:33,867
So you know what's good.

1260
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,652
And this, of course, is not very good.

1261
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:38,305
Comrade General, call Dulevich here!

1262
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,149
Do you think flasks from
it would be better?

1263
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:44,951
Good, bad, but you need to eat.

1264
01:35:45,360 --> 01:35:46,691
Nothing to do about.

1265
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,668
You yourself know that there are
garrisons in all the villages around.

1266
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:52,231
You can't bring anything without a fight.

1267
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:56,253
This is the point, and
not that Dulevich is bad.

1268
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,431
Why are potatoes frozen?

1269
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,551
Because someone dug badly, not deep.

1270
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:05,474
Dulevich oversaw it, this is a fact, and
he will get it for it, I will follow it.

1271
01:36:06,440 --> 01:36:10,136
Do you know what he will get?
The same potato as yours!

1272
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:11,230
I'll follow!

1273
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,345
But even if it's not frozen,
that's not the point.

1274
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,111
It's about the blockade.

1275
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,845
And we have to break it!

1276
01:36:23,080 --> 01:36:24,286
Do you know what the Germans have?

1277
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:25,791
Drape!

1278
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:29,856
Lupk and Rovno are already free,
fights near Kovel.

1279
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:32,167
And how much is from us? Two
hundred and something kilometres.

1280
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:38,623
And if we hit them now,
what would happen to them?

1281
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:41,987
Sitting in the swamp...

1282
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:47,368
Lice gnaw at us, we eat a smelly slop.

1283
01:36:47,960 --> 01:36:49,769
We are cold and wet.

1284
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:56,536
But this is not for long. Get ready,
When the time comes, I will lead you.

1285
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,747
And not on some kind
of Avissa, Ana Bialystok!

1286
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,032
Let's hit the Fritz up to the tomatoes!

1287
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:09,776
If we are alive, we will have
real tankettes, guns, and who

1288
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,644
knows, maybe even Sweden!

1289
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,336
To the Fritz! To Bialystok!

1290
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,771
Long live Boldyn!

1291
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:29,788
Well, I have to go. Hold on. Soon we
will take a walk in Białystok restaurants!

1292
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:36,463
I give you my word, the priest in the
church could not have said it better!

1293
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,193
Heard, Mrachnyy, has already
made a preacher out of me!

1294
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,754
The general sees
through the soldier's soul!

1295
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:46,545
Immediately to them about real tanks, guns!

1296
01:37:48,760 --> 01:37:51,923
Aty what, tramp, do you think I lied?

1297
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:55,607
What do you think,
I deceived my own soldiers?

1298
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,365
If he said real, then real.

1299
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:03,696
If you don't believe me,
ask the Mrachnyy One.

1300
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:08,214
Mrachnyy! Tell the captain
where we'll get the tankettes from.

1301
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,511
They are being parachuted, Comrade Captain.

1302
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:15,753
Well, Ivanov, have you heard? Landing.

1303
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:20,576
In turn, comrades,
we must build an aerodrome.

1304
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:23,786
After all, tankettes on parachutes
will not be lowered.

1305
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,090
Do you think the clearing
behind the hills will do?

1306
01:38:30,720 --> 01:38:32,711
You just need to pack the snow

1307
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:37,592
Vanadek, start work
tomorrow, two weeks.

1308
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:44,056
You also need to apply to the
centre to send tanks, artillery,

1309
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:46,014
mortars, and air support.

1310
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:47,573
Any questions?

1311
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,588
No? Then you are free.

1312
01:38:56,040 --> 01:38:57,394
Siebert, stay.

1313
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,706
Have you seen these guys?

1314
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:09,205
Already sniffed.

1315
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:14,489
I give them an operational task, and they?
They don't even look at each other, tramps!

1316
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:17,325
They don't believe again.

1317
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:22,893
Or do it in two weeks, or never,
just watch the snow melt.

1318
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,311
And then you can't walk here.

1319
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:30,496
Mrachnyy, remind me at the meeting
that the aerodrome should be in a

1320
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,684
week, not two. clear?

1321
01:40:04,401 --> 01:40:08,668
Comrade General, allow me to
report. Team Zelenets during the
construction of the aerodrome.

1322
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:11,753
Is there an answer from the centre?

1323
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,285
No, Comrade General.

1324
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,510
Did you send a message?

1325
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:15,374
Yes sir.

1326
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,185
When?

1327
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,064
Three days ago.

1328
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:24,705
Why couldn't you yourself, you
brute, report that they were not
answering the front from there?

1329
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,024
Send a reminder.

1330
01:40:28,120 --> 01:40:29,110
I will.

1331
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:34,351
And you, Krupa,
when will you finish the aerodrome?

1332
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:36,530
By order, Comrade General.

1333
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:39,447
So, in six... in five days.

1334
01:40:40,241 --> 01:40:41,311
If only it were cold!

1335
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:45,144
If Krupa had no moustache,
he would be a girl!

1336
01:40:45,681 --> 01:40:46,933
Krupitsky, Comrade General.

1337
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:52,154
Good. In five days you will
report on the completion of the task.

1338
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:57,834
Only this rain, Comrade General...
Water from all the hills flows here.

1339
01:40:58,600 --> 01:41:03,094
We carry snow, we tamp it down,
and it all floats. And without tamping. .

1340
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,407
Just don't.

1341
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,086
Listen...

1342
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:12,147
Or maybe you don't like
that there will be an aerodrome?

1343
01:41:13,240 --> 01:41:16,608
What are you standing like an idol?

1344
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:18,544
Do you want it in the face?

1345
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,471
Five days to
complete and report!

1346
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:22,864
Yes, sir.

1347
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:28,911
What about you? Why are you laughing?

1348
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,605
But Comrade General...

1349
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:36,130
No, I can see in your eyes that
you're laughing. Glad it's raining, huh?

1350
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,247
No.

1351
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:40,273
Oh, you already sniffed with them ..

1352
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:41,065
General...

1353
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:42,264
Oh you...

1354
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:14,033
Is there an answer from the centre?

1355
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:15,607
About?

1356
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,150
These wedges.

1357
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:20,491
Boy, are you crazy too?
Didn't know it was contagious.

1358
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:24,269
Do you really think we
sent that radio message?

1359
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,954
From which it follows that we
have a commander who has gone?

1360
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,086
And that will be?

1361
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:31,532
Nothing will happen.

1362
01:42:32,241 --> 01:42:33,606
We'll let you know today.

1363
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:35,692
What won't they send?

1364
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:41,308
What will they send. What
will these damn tankettes send!

1365
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:45,733
Wouldn't it be possible to postpone it?
At least for two days?

1366
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,650
And then what?

1367
01:42:48,241 --> 01:42:50,232
Ready to do what the hell.

1368
01:42:50,801 --> 01:42:54,692
No, we'll pile up the answer today.
And one to calm him down.

1369
01:42:57,680 --> 01:43:03,733
Listen... Maybe change the cartridges in
his pistol to blanks? What do you think?

1370
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,331
Well, eagles! No rain today, huh?

1371
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,191
Yes, sir.

1372
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:16,831
That's good. Because in the rain,
my eagles are like wet chickens.

1373
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,270
Well, what is there?

1374
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:23,204
I report, Comrade General,
there is an answer.

1375
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:23,986
Well.

1376
01:43:25,361 --> 01:43:27,614
There is agreement, General.

1377
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:38,532
You didn't believe me, bastards!

1378
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,971
So here you go, read on!

1379
01:43:42,760 --> 01:43:45,256
"In response..." and so on...

1380
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:49,513
"We notify that we agree to
the operation you are planning."

1381
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,416
"In pursuance of the
foregoing, within ten days,"

1382
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:58,496
"as soon as flying weather sets in,
you'll get a regiment of light tanks,"

1383
01:43:58,520 --> 01:44:01,256
"as well as two batteries
of anti-tank rifles."

1384
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:04,068
Report on what, Krupa?

1385
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,827
aerodrome, Comrade General.

1386
01:44:06,961 --> 01:44:11,626
You see! Look, Kholera.
If you don't, I'll kill you!

1387
01:44:14,321 --> 01:44:17,109
And what are you like...
like taken out of a coffin?

1388
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,225
Don't you like that the general is right?

1389
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:33,564
I give my head that they
gossiped that this is crazy, huh?

1390
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:39,936
To you! Today is a good day
for me to mock the incredulous!

1391
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:41,030
Mrachnyy!

1392
01:44:42,161 --> 01:44:45,449
You alone are clean, and since
you are clean, run for a clean one!

1393
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,373
We need to clean this up.

1394
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:05,292
How much to take?

1395
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,333
What's the difference,
take as much as you want.

1396
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:10,686
Clean...

1397
01:46:12,081 --> 01:46:12,912
Mrachnyy!

1398
01:46:15,760 --> 01:46:17,467
Did you put on pants?

1399
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:19,428
No, that's good.

1400
01:46:19,761 --> 01:46:23,607
Run to Vanadek, let him send messengers to
the brigades for a report, and come here.

1401
01:46:23,720 --> 01:46:24,425
Yes, sir!

1402
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,852
Oh, here comes Comrade Major!

1403
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:28,688
Do you hear?

1404
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,464
I hear.

1405
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,752
Bombs are bullshit...

1406
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,668
Machine guns.

1407
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,151
Comrade General, the Germans
have launched an offensive.

1408
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,129
Where, when, by what means?

1409
01:46:41,360 --> 01:46:45,524
There are no wounded yet, but machine guns
are heard from the direction of the Starogo.

1410
01:46:45,640 --> 01:46:46,789
Did you send messengers?

1411
01:46:46,840 --> 01:46:47,784
Yes sir!

1412
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,993
Intelligence reported on the concentration?

1413
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,286
That's right, Comrade General,

1414
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:53,129
When?

1415
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:53,786
The day before yesterday.

1416
01:46:54,440 --> 01:46:56,431
So why didn't you tell me, you bastard!

1417
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:59,216
How is it, Comrade General! Immediately,
the day before yesterday at the meeting.

1418
01:46:59,240 --> 01:47:02,289
Comrade General personally told
Galalei to conduct reconnaissance.

1419
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:05,794
Bugger!

1420
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:19,073
Oh hero. So he ran, almost
got a blow, What's there again?

1421
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:23,671
From Colonel Starogo. Half an
hour ago, the Germans crossed
the swamp. Brigades attack.

1422
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:25,816
And you let them pass!

1423
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:27,831
Very smart. How many?

1424
01:47:27,921 --> 01:47:30,310
The colonel said,
about a regiment of infantry.

1425
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:34,106
What else did the Colonel say?
Perhaps he asked for reinforcements?

1426
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:39,256
OK. Run to the colonel and tell
him to hold on as long as possible

1427
01:47:39,280 --> 01:47:42,989
And if possible, let him push the
Germans back into the swamp. It's clear?

1428
01:47:43,240 --> 01:47:44,207
Understood!

1429
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:45,784
Don't count on reinforcements.

1430
01:47:45,880 --> 01:47:46,813
Understood!

1431
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:49,212
Kholera clear.

1432
01:47:52,120 --> 01:47:53,394
Overslept.

1433
01:47:54,680 --> 01:47:57,968
For several weeks it was warm, warmed up,
the swamp dried up, so they crossed over.

1434
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:01,656
They struck with two columns
on both sides of the lake.
Caught the old man by surprise.

1435
01:48:01,680 --> 01:48:02,954
Didn't hold back. There are those killed

1436
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,867
AT & forge in the direction of
the centre of the hills, that is, on us.

1437
01:48:06,160 --> 01:48:09,414
Fuck them. We'll see.
What about Okhorovich?

1438
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:10,664
He held his position.

1439
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:16,173
From Green.

1440
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:22,133
Zelenets is in order,
the Germans were delayed.

1441
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,373
Good.

1442
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:26,167
If only to hold out until the
night, they will not move at night.

1443
01:48:27,480 --> 01:48:31,792
Let the Starogo One gather whoever he
can and, together with Zelenets,
push them out into the swamp.

1444
01:48:32,120 --> 01:48:33,064
Report Green.

1445
01:48:33,240 --> 01:48:34,014
Yes, sir.

1446
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:40,268
Well, Elusya?

1447
01:48:41,521 --> 01:48:42,670
Are you afraid?

1448
01:48:43,240 --> 01:48:45,390
Never mind, let's break them down.

1449
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,793
The Fritz are no longer the same.

1450
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:53,706
Let's go to Bialystok,
I'll buy you a dress, Elyusya!

1451
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:57,144
Luckily the boys didn't run away.

1452
01:48:58,280 --> 01:48:59,247
Mrachnyy!

1453
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,889
I'll go and see what's happening
with the counter-attack.

1454
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:36,104
Attention!

1455
01:49:38,640 --> 01:49:42,452
What are you doing here, 2?
Are you causing a panic?

1456
01:49:43,360 --> 01:49:44,612
Do you want a bullet in the forehead?

1457
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:48,367
I report, Comrade General.
According to the instructions, we
eliminate the unnecessary archive.

1458
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:49,732
What instructions are you carrying!

1459
01:49:49,880 --> 01:49:52,986
Comrade General himself signed,
in case of an offensive,

1460
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:53,991
When?

1461
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:56,414
Another year ago. Here he is.

1462
01:49:58,520 --> 01:49:59,772
You only create panic

1463
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:02,103
Damn you.

1464
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,087
To stand!

1465
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,466
Squad leader, come to me!

1466
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,749
What are you? Are you running, dog?

1467
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,009
Comrade General, order.

1468
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:21,825
Whose?

1469
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:22,688
Colonel Starogo.

1470
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:24,467
What are you driving me! Where and why?

1471
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:28,771
There were shots, not far from
here. He told me to gather
people and comb the thickets.

1472
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,128
Like this, in a crowd, blindly?

1473
01:50:31,440 --> 01:50:32,987
I report sent a patrol.

1474
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:34,064
Guys, follow me!

1475
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:04,253
Why don't you attack?

1476
01:51:04,360 --> 01:51:05,111
Nothing.

1477
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:06,366
Ate from Zelenets?

1478
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:07,630
Stop plugging holes.

1479
01:51:07,880 --> 01:51:09,769
Oh you! I myself will
command, Come on PPSH.

1480
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:10,369
General...

1481
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:11,470
Hurry!

1482
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:13,570
Boys, get in position!

1483
01:51:24,640 --> 01:51:28,167
Boys, for a free Poland, Follow me!

1484
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:30,351
Hooray!

1485
01:52:29,960 --> 01:52:31,507
Mrachnyy!

1486
01:52:31,921 --> 01:52:33,969
Did you see how the Fritz received us?

1487
01:52:34,520 --> 01:52:37,576
We won't be able to hold out for long.
Run to Vanadek, let him gather whoever

1488
01:52:37,600 --> 01:52:40,353
he can and attack the Fritz from the
other side. Come on boy! Already!

1489
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:25,291
Long live Poland.

1490
01:55:55,480 --> 01:55:56,606
Get up.

1491
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:05,450
Raise the people, Mrachnyy.

1492
01:56:06,641 --> 01:56:07,949
Raise!

1493
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:09,271
I will.

1494
01:56:11,121 --> 01:56:13,795
Listen to my command. Get up!
