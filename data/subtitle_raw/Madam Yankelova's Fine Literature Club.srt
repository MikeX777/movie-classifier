MADAM YANKELOVA'S
FINE LITERATURE CLUB

2
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,740
Sophie, lift it up.

3
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,980
Lift it up ! Show some flesh, lift it !

4
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,660
Hello.

5
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,260
Whoa... No way.

6
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,380
- What happened ?
- Forget it, he was fat and old.

7
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,020
- Stop !
- What are you doing ? Are you crazy ?

8
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,500
- We need a ride.
- Get out of here you old hags.

9
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,420
These old hags, if you give them a
ride, will show you such a good time...

10
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,580
Milk will come out of your ears.

11
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,100
What's holding you back ? You should
come with us. There's a party.

12
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,060
There's music, there's good food,
there are young girls...

13
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,180
- Young girls ?
- Young girls.

14
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
Come on, hurry up.

15
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,300
You owe me one.

16
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,820
"The peddler stayed with the lady."

17
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,460
"Not in the old barn,"

18
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,180
"and not in the room for old things
that were no longer used."

19
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,380
"No, he stayed in the..."

20
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,980
Being late is unacceptable in our club.

21
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,070
Very handsome...

22
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,940
What's going on ?
You said young girls.

23
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,020
You like them young, huh ?

24
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,420
The ring doesn't stop you
from looking for young girls ?

25
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,620
- I think I'll have to pass.
- No, you don't...

26
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,260
Hannah, clean it up.

27
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,270
Get up !

28
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:52,620
Official members of the club
do not clean.

29
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,780
We have sanitation ladies for that.

30
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,020
If it wasn't for Hannah,
this man wouldn't have been here.

31
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,420
Sophie, stop talking nonsense !
I didn't help her at all.

32
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,380
After winning her 100th trophy
at the "Woman of the Week" competition,

33
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,020
Official club member Devorah
was accepted to the House of Lordesses.

34
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:27,300
The senior lordesses
warmly welcomed the new member.

35
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,900
This week, the House of Lordesses
members enjoyed a variety of activities

36
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:38,220
such as pedicures and manicures,
innovative facial treatments,

37
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,780
lounging by the pool

38
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:46,580
and listening to records
in the presence of Madame Yankelova.

39
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,860
Meanwhile, the women of the
Housekeeping and Sanitation Department

40
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,500
had a workshop led by
the head of department, Babushka,

41
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,660
on the perfect cleanliness
of toilets and sinks.

42
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,980
The winner of the club's
"Woman of the Week" competition,

43
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,740
who brought the worthiest man,
making this her 98th trophy

44
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,260
is official club member, Sophie.

45
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:33,220
Excuse me, her 99th trophy.

46
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,020
A picture from the days
when you were still young and pretty.

47
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,580
- Good night.
- Thank you.

48
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,180
- Good night.
- Thank you.

49
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
Thank you.

50
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,540
When is your friend coming ?

51
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,700
We need to start thinking
about our future, Sophie.

52
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,540
- It can't go on like this.
- What are you talking about ?

53
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,420
You will soon understand.

54
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,340
Once they'll put you in the Sanitation
with me, then you'll understand.

55
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,340
- You are not young anymore.
- Sanitation ?

56
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,500
One more trophy
and I'm in the House of Lordesses.

57
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,380
Just because you won today,
thanks to the man whom I persuaded,

58
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,860
doesn't mean you'll make it
next time.

59
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,660
It's been five years since
you last succeeded.

60
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,260
Don't you understand it
means nothing ?

61
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,060
Next time you'll bring an ugly man
again, and you're doomed.

62
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,420
Don't you understand this
thing is meaningless ?

63
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,980
It's just a piece of plastic.
That's what it is.

64
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,460
Look what you've done.
I'm leaving.

65
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,740
Are you coming ?

66
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,900
- Sophie...
- What ?

67
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,300
I'm sorry for breaking your trophy.

68
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Good night !

69
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,660
"Agnon Writings Researcher
Wins International Prize"

70
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,380
What is going on with you ?
You'll destroy your nail.

71
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,900
What do you want me to do ?

72
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,580
It's 6:45 p.m. and there is no one
here worth looking at.

73
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,340
Will you join me to search
behind the strip club ?

74
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,620
You've wasted a whole week
for nothing.

75
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:15,180
- Look, just what you need.
- I don't stand a chance with him.

76
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,380
- Hello !
- Hello !

77
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,740
- Need any help ?
- Yes.

78
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,980
I'm looking for "The Piano Teacher"
by Elfriede Jelinek.

79
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,620
Excellent book...
Sophie, that's just for you.

80
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,540
Come take him
to the prose shelf, please.

81
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,980
- Thank you, I'll find it on my own...
- Just a moment ! Where are you going ?

82
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,460
Come and meet, this is Sophie,
look at her skin...

83
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:43,140
Her skin is like Carrara marble, huh ?

84
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,100
I think I'll manage.

85
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Thanks.

86
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,740
Come on, Sophie,
go for it !

87
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,900
Run, what are you waiting for ? You
want to be stuck with this old man ?

88
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,460
Go on !

89
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,340
Excuse me ?

90
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
I thought to myself,

91
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,380
maybe you like...

92
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,860
Viennese literature. Modern.
If you asked for that book,

93
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
I wanted to invite you...

94
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,620
If you want to come with me to the
Fine Literature Club, we're reading...

95
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:31,860
- Tonight we're just reading...
- I can't make it tonight.

96
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,900
I'll continue searching.

97
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Hannah ?

98
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,220
Hannah ?

99
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,740
Hannah !

100
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,420
Hannah...

101
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:03,020
Hannah ?

102
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,820
"No more sanitation for me.
Take care of my Pedro."

103
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,260
- How old are you ?
- 23.

104
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,340
Do you like literature ?

105
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Is this your man for tonight ?

106
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,180
Hannah didn't help you this time.

107
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,020
HANNAH

108
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,300
- Where is she ?
- Where's who ?

109
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,620
Your friend, Hannah. Where is she ?

110
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

111
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:10,860
welcome to the Fine Literature Club,
established by Madame Yankelova.

112
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
It is time for dinner.

113
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,660
Cordial greetings to the official
members of the club

114
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,300
and their companions.

115
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,820
Cordial greetings to my deputy,
Lordess Razia.

116
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,020
And of course, cordial greetings
to the House of Lordesses,

117
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
the elite members of the club,

118
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,940
headed by Lordess Zipporah Bluma.

119
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:52,380
Today we shall read a special book,
which I greatly admire, but first,

120
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,980
I would like to thank our friends,

121
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,100
the Housekeeping
and Sanitation Department women,

122
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,780
headed by Ms. Babushka,

123
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,900
who always care for us,

124
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:12,700
and will continue to do
so throughout this evening.

125
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,220
Where's Hannah ?

126
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,300
Today we shall read a story
which I love very much.

127
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,540
A novella.
"The Lady and the Peddler,"

128
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:50,420
written by Nobel Prize Laureate,
Mr. Shmuel Agnon,

129
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,860
the greatest Hebrew novelist.

130
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,100
"A certain Jewish peddler was
traveling with his stock"

131
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:09,540
"from town to town
and village to village."

132
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:15,260
"One day he found himself in a wooded
region far from any settlement.

133
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,740
"He saw a lone house."

134
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:21,980
"He approached it, and standing before
the door, he called out his wares."

135
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,620
"A lady came outside
and spoke to him..."

136
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,420
"But whatever food she tried to eat
she would throw up,"

137
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,860
"for she had already forgotten the
science of eating ordinary human food,"

138
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,180
"as it was her practice"

139
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:43,140
"to eat the flesh of her husbands,
whom she slaughtered,"

140
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,780
"and to drink their blood,"

141
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,100
"just as she wanted to do
with the peddler."

142
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,460
7.14.

143
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,220
It's a waste of time,
no reason to measure him.

144
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,300
To the crows.

145
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,420
8.8.

146
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,300
9.34.

147
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:42,100
It seems that once again, as usual,
aside from a slight slip last week,

148
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,380
the trophy goes to Lola.

149
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,380
Babushka needs help
in the Sanitation Department.

150
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,820
Hannah disappeared.

151
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,260
Sophie to Sanitation.

152
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,980
When did you last see Hannah ?

153
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,820
- At the library.
- Was there a man ?

154
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,140
Love is a four-letter word,
two idiots and one broken heart.

155
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,740
But you never listen !

156
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,340
How long will it last ?
A week ? Two weeks ?

157
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,660
She is old and fat.

158
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,820
To betray your friends,
just like that ?

159
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,380
It's the last time you bring
such a man.

160
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,180
If you don't bring a man with a minimum
score of 8.8 to our next meeting,

161
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:53,140
you will be permanently assigned
to the Sanitation Department.

162
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,540
Hannah's position is now open...

163
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,060
I'm on my 99th trophy, one more
and I'm in the House of Lordesses.

164
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:02,060
So it's all up to you now.

165
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,900
Bring an 8.8, and you might win
your 100th trophy

166
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,220
and move to the House of Lordesses.
Bring an unworthy man

167
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,300
and you will be permanently assigned
to the Sanitation Deptartment. Got it ?

168
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,820
And Golda awaits you
at the hot dog stand,

169
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,860
today was Hannah's shift.

170
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
Pedro !

171
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,500
I was waiting for you.

172
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,780
Your shift ended ages ago,
where were you ?

173
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,380
Nowhere.

174
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,020
I'm just setting up the house,
come on in.

175
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,940
What is she doing here ?

176
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,540
We assumed Hannah
won't need her house anymore.

177
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,180
We didn't want to leave
you all alone.

178
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:07,900
With all the work at the library
and with the dog.

179
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:11,620
Good thing she took her
stinky pigeon.

180
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:20,780
From now on,
you do not take your eyes off her.

181
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,340
Do not leave her alone,
even for a second, is that clear ?

182
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
Where's Hannah ?

183
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Let go of her.

184
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,220
Don't worry. We'll find Hannah.

185
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,900
And Sophie,

186
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,980
Sophie...

187
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,180
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...

188
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,700
The clock is ticking.

189
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,100
One more week,

190
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:29,700
and it's welcome to the Housekeeping
and Sanitation Department.

191
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:53,620
What's the rush ?

192
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,500
Excuse me.

193
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,700
We make sure to lock
the trellis door as well.

194
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,820
Hi.

195
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,580
Can I help you ?

196
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:47,860
Yes, I'm looking for a book, I'm not
sure if you have such books here,

197
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,700
"I Was Colonel Schultz's
Private Bitch."

198
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,980
You're in the wrong place.
We don't have such books.

199
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,220
But I'm sure we can find something
else that will interest you.

200
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,580
It's time for the afternoon cleaning.

201
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,540
Can't you see I'm busy ?
You do it.

202
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,460
See this ? This isn't just decoration.
I'm the one in charge here.

203
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,620
Leave her alone !

204
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,820
Old witch.

205
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Hello !

206
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,060
I'm looking for...

207
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,460
Sophie.

208
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,540
That's me.

209
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,140
Hello !
I'm Lola, may I help you ?

210
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,580
Hello !

211
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,420
My name is Yosef.
Nice to meet you !

212
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,580
I'm writing an essay
about Agnon's short stories

213
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,620
and I heard you are
an expert in the field.

214
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,540
- I wouldn't say an expert...
- I'd be happy to help.

215
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,820
I've also read quite a bit of Agnon,
what is your favorite book ?

216
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:24,180
Can we sit and discuss it now ?

217
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,260
You claim here that in Agnon's work
there's a basis of folk tales,

218
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:43,020
but I don't understand
which stories you refer to.

219
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,260
- What ?
- Nothing...

220
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,300
This Thursday we have a meeting
of the Fine Literature Club,

221
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,580
this week we will be reading Agnon,

222
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,780
exactly for people like ourselves.

223
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,860
I found this between the shelves.

224
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,780
Didn't you say it's supposed to be at
the back ? What was it doing there ?

225
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,860
Waiting for you to clean.

226
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,300
Excuse me,
I apologize for this behavior.

227
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Oh, I'm sorry !

228
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,380
Forgive me...

229
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,820
Forgive me...

230
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,740
Let me clean this for you...

231
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,060
It's fine, I'm okay.

232
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:40,580
No, leave it, it will leave
a stain, it contains bleach.

233
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,500
No worries, there, it's over.

234
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,500
Regarding what you said before,

235
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,100
an evening at a literature club
sounds very nice.

236
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:29,140
Library Staff Residence
Men strictly forbidden

237
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,020
Hello !
Can you hear me ?

238
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,580
Any idea when the bus is coming ?

239
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,820
Hello ! Can you hear me ?

240
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,980
I'm drowning here. Can you at least
let me in the stairway ?

241
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,900
- Can you hear this madman ?
- So what ?

242
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,380
Maybe we should let him
in the stairway.

243
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,780
Sophie, as a senior member,

244
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,700
I'd even say very senior,

245
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,820
you know men are not allowed
in the residence.

246
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
Bleach.

247
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,660
What's this ?

248
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:59,260
That's a competition I used
to take part in...

249
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:02,380
Love is a four-letter word, two idiots
and one broken heart.

250
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,900
Last one was five years ago.
Why did you stop ?

251
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,980
Please don't touch this.
Thank you.

252
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,460
Can you fix that ?

253
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,580
Do you have something to eat ?

254
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,460
Are you okay ?

255
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:52,580
I'm really sorry about the power cut.

256
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,780
If you want,
I can come back with tools to fix it.

257
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,980
No, you can't come back here.
You're not allowed to be here.

258
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
Men are forbidden in the residence.

259
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:09,220
Who's that ?

260
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,100
A woman I used to know.

261
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:26,780
I think you can't go back outside now,
but you have to leave before dawn.

262
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,260
You can't be seen here.

263
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,980
9.75...

264
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:12,460
What are you doing ?

265
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:17,700
Do you have a plier ?
I'd like to fix the electricity.

266
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:21,500
- No, I don't have a plier.
- I'll have to come back with tools.

267
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,020
You shouldn't even be here.

268
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,780
- Will we meet in the library ?
- Just get out quickly.

269
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,340
My neighbor could be here any minute,
please leave.

270
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,460
I'll see you in the library in a bit.

271
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:42,140
"Spatial Text in Agnon's Writings"
by Kafri

272
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,140
- Your doorbell isn't working.
- The electricity went out.

273
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:55,580
Call the Repairs Dept.
so that I won't be late because of you.

274
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,420
Do you mind ?

275
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,900
Did you call the Repairs Dept. ?
I won't be late again because of you.

276
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,500
It's time for afternoon cleaning.
Are you coming ?

277
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,380
- What are you doing ?
- What ?

278
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,460
You're putting two cards
in the same book !

279
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:58,540
Did you call the Repairs Department ?
No excuses tomorrow.

280
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:19,500
- Repairs Department, good morning.
- Hello, speaking.

281
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,220
I would like to report a power cut
in staff residence A/538.

282
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:29,220
No problem, we can come this evening.
What time is good for you ?

283
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,860
Hello to you too...

284
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,740
How did you manage last night ?
It was cold outside.

285
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,940
What's up, sweetie ?

286
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,180
Can't you see I'm busy ?
Wait for me there.

287
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,380
I found an article I wrote about Agnon,
I think you will find it helpful.

288
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,540
I can also tell you some secrets
about Agnon.

289
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,300
I'm at the counter.

290
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,860
Wait a moment,
I wanted to ask you something.

291
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,940
Excuse me !

292
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,500
You can't enter the library with bags.

293
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,620
I'll put it in the locker.

294
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:22,180
Sophie.

295
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,340
Dinner.
Not tinned sweetcorn.

296
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,100
My back hurts.

297
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:21,260
Should I come over
with my tools now ?

298
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:28,140
In the article you gave me,
you wrote that...

299
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:31,260
"Agnon has an intertextual clash"

300
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:35,460
"between the text
and its infrastructure."

301
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,820
Where do you think this can be seen

302
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:42,060
in "And the Crooked Shall
Be Made Straight"

303
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,980
or in "The Lady and the Peddler" ?

304
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,580
Wait for me at the station,
until I give you a sign.

305
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,350
Hungry ?

306
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,420
- And wet.
- Come in, we have two hours.

307
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,460
Are you not eating with me ?

308
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,020
"What difference does it make to you
whether I eat or drink ?"

309
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,220
Agnon.

310
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,620
Yeah, sure.

311
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,420
"The Lady and the Peddler," correct ?

312
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,540
We will be reading it
at the club this week.

313
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:10,940
Your friend, Lola, also invited me
to come with her to the club,

314
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,660
but I told her I'm already going
with you.

315
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,420
You have to leave, I'm sorry.

316
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
Wait a moment.

317
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,780
"Meet me where we used
to watch the stars."

318
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:43,540
Another schnitzel ?

319
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,820
I'm really sorry, Sophie.

320
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,020
Haim wanted to make sure
nobody is following us.

321
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,140
- What ?
- You didn't even say goodbye.

322
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,830
I couldn't take it anymore.

323
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,980
I couldn't take it, clean for them,
serve them, I just couldn't.

324
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:00,500
And then Haim came.

325
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:04,300
There is a thing called love in the
world. And love is a wonderful thing.

326
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:10,420
Come with us.
Run away with us, Sophie.

327
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,340
You can find a man too.

328
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:17,060
A man who would love you,
hug you, give you a kiss.

329
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:21,860
Let's run away, Sophie.

330
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,980
Come with me, Sophie.

331
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,740
You can't run away from them.

332
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,980
Sophie, I called you here because
I want to ask something of you.

333
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:38,460
I need money. Not much.

334
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,380
I need money for plane tickets,
Haim wants us to get away.

335
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,700
Please, I have no one in this world,
except you.

336
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:47,620
I'm worried he'll start asking
what all these rings are.

337
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:47,020
Sophie !

338
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:50,910
Sophie !

339
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,660
Lola, go to the library,
I'll be right there.

340
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:55,940
Come on !
It's already eight, come out.

341
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,420
Leave a few minutes after I do
and shut the door.

342
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,300
- Come.
- Excuse me ?

343
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,580
I thought we always make
sure to lock the trellis.

344
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:10,660
Lola...

345
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,230
Hannah ?

346
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,060
- Hannah !
- There's no one here.

347
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,420
I can't sleep.

348
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:23,940
- Let's go.
- Why aren't you locking it ?

349
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:36,740
And the trellis ?

350
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:07,380
You were right.
She's not as innocent as she seems.

351
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,660
I found hundreds of pictures
of her with different men.

352
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:13,900
Every picture is signed:
"Fine Literature Club."

353
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,140
Can you run a check on this ?

354
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,380
Yosef ?

355
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,820
Why did you lock ?

356
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,700
Tell me, that literature club,
it's tomorrow, right ?

357
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,900
Did you touch this ?

358
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,580
No.

359
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,500
- I have to go back to the library.
- I'll join you.

360
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,580
No, don't come with me.

361
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,100
- Why ? I want to continue my research.
- I can't help you today.

362
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:06,180
So can I come here tonight ?

363
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:08,180
Last night...

364
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,260
I suddenly fell asleep.

365
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:15,260
I'm sorry, but men are not allowed
in the residence.

366
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:23,140
Sophie.

367
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,500
Meet me at the park at 10 p.m.

368
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:45,260
What is this ? How many husbands
have you buried, ma'am ?

369
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,180
Your secret weapon to fight wrinkles

370
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,540
- For everything, 5,000.
- Fine.

371
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:03,340
That's not for you.

372
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,900
- How much is it ?
- It's not for you...

373
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:09,540
It won't help you at this stage.

374
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,820
Okay.
Give me 200 and it's yours.

375
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:35,020
- Are you sure she didn't meet Hannah ?
- I'm sure. I was with her 24/7.

376
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,900
The money is for Hannah.

377
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:39,260
- They'll probably meet tonight.
- No, not tonight.

378
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,820
Tomorrow evening.
They have some kind of a club meeting.

379
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:45,300
Yosef, drop it. Go to the library
and don't take your eyes off her.

380
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:50,220
- Yeah, but listen...
- Focus on your mission, find Hannah !

381
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,300
Hannah !

382
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,100
Sophie !
I thought you wouldn't come.

383
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:05,180
Did you bring the money ?

384
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,700
- I have to go.
-Sophie, please, come with us tomorrow.

385
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:10,660
Come, run away with us.
Sophie, it's your last chance !

386
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:12,180
Go without me, okay ?

387
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:15,700
Tomorrow I'm getting my 100th trophy,
I know it.

388
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,540
Wait a moment.

389
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,500
This is my number in Paris,
at the Metropol Hotel.

390
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,180
If you have a change of heart,
I'll be waiting for you there.

391
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:30,260
- Goodbye.
- Sophie !

392
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:36,100
Take care of yourself.

393
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:44,300
Sixteen to one, sixteen to one,
get to location point 137.

394
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,340
Well done, Yosef.

395
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:03,100
- You caught a dangerous criminal.
- If only you knew what is going...

396
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,300
I am meeting at 10 p.m.
to find out about that club.

397
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:11,060
- Again with that club ?
- Razia, something is going on there.

398
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:14,540
I found a picture at her house
of someone who I think is missing...

399
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:16,350
Drop it.

400
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:21,780
Go home, Yosef. You caught Hannah,
you've done your part.

401
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:30,500
- Something is going on there.
- Be at the station tomorrow at 8 a.m.

402
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,580
I have a new case for you.

403
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,900
Efraimi...

404
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,100
Do you still have our class photo
from the police academy ?

405
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,300
- Yeah.
- Give it to me.

406
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,340
Who's this ? Him.

407
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,540
That's Schlesinger.
You don't remember him ?

408
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,420
- Where is he ? Have you seen him ?
- Has anyone seen him ?

409
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:36,060
He's missing, no one has seen him.

410
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:43,820
Missing

411
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:54,380
Yehoshua, bring me case 653/Schles.

412
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:02,340
I was working in the archives back
when your father was in the police.

413
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,460
I know, Yehoshua.

414
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:21,740
The file is empty.

415
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,620
That's really strange.
Let me check the listings.

416
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:30,820
That file of yours which disappeared

417
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,060
was signed out and retrieved
this morning by...

418
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,740
Commander Harrari.
You know anything about it ?

419
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,700
Razia ? Let me see.

420
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:46,140
Yehoshua, I need another
missing person's file.

421
01:01:47,260 --> 01:01:49,260
Please give me my father's file.

422
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,020
Sophie.

423
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,620
I'm sorry I'm late,
I've had a rough day.

424
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,700
Me too.

425
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,100
Let's go for a walk ?

426
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:45,140
Come on.

427
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,860
Wait a moment.

428
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,100
I'm sorry I was late.

429
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:34,980
"My lady lives all alone. Has she no
husband or friend and companion ?"

430
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,500
Agnon.

431
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,900
"And if I told you,
do you think you would understand ?"

432
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:58,820
I just recently read a funny
saying about love.

433
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:03,460
"Love is a four-letter word,
two idiots and one broken heart."

434
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:08,180
Funny, isn't it ?

435
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:14,660
I think whoever wrote it is a coward.
Scared of loving, scared of feeling.

436
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:20,100
Would you run away for true love ?

437
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:22,820
For true love ?

438
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:27,180
I'd run all the way to the moon.

439
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:59,980
And our outstanding "Woman of
the Week," with her 100th trophy,

440
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:05,140
which grants her eternal membership
of the House of Lordesses, is Sophie.

441
01:05:41,140 --> 01:05:43,140
Yosef.

442
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,420
I think you should leave.

443
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,620
And it's not a good idea for you
to come to the club with me today.

444
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:01,500
- But why, what happened ?
- It's just not a good idea.

445
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:37,660
I'll come to the library tonight,
and we'll go to the club together.

446
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:08,140
- May I ?
- The charge is per minute.

447
01:08:11,980 --> 01:08:13,260
Telegram Service, hello.

448
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:18,140
Hello, I would like to send a telegram.

449
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:21,060
to Paris, the Metropol Hotel.

450
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,900
"Dear Hannah..."

451
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:30,100
"Dear Hannah,
I'm finally doing it."

452
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:35,060
"I can't believe this is happening
to me, but it is."

453
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,140
"I found the man I love..."

454
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:42,220
Sorry, wait...

455
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:45,020
Please correct:

456
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:49,820
"I found a man, and we're in love..."

457
01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:53,740
"We're on our way to you."

458
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:55,860
"Sophie."

459
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,300
Yosef !

460
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:07,020
Hey, what are you doing here ?

461
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,460
- We can't go to the club.
- What do you mean ? We said we'll go.

462
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,260
We just can't go there.

463
01:09:13,620 --> 01:09:16,460
- We need to go away right now.
- Okay... okay.

464
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:22,020
- Give me a minute, I'll get my bag.
- No...

465
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,180
I wasn't considering going with her
even for a moment,

466
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:58,860
I wanted to test the limits
of your patience.

467
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,670
I get it.

468
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:03,940
And now, knowing you
have pretty good stamina,

469
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:10,580
I ask myself... if it's possible for me
to join you, to your literature club.

470
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:12,980
Of course.

471
01:10:13,340 --> 01:10:15,340
Of course.

472
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,420
- To the airport.
- Right away.

473
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:14,420
- Keep driving.
- Ma'am, are you crazy ?

474
01:11:55,660 --> 01:12:00,020
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are now welcome to dinner.

475
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:06,180
Today we will read a story
that I love very much.

476
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:12,180
"The Lady and the Peddler"
by Mr. Shmuel Agnon.

477
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,980
"A certain Jewish peddler..."

478
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:21,540
What's going on ?

479
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:33,420
Oh, Yosef,
I'm glad you could make it.

480
01:12:39,940 --> 01:12:41,980
Did you want to say something ?

481
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:47,220
With your permission, Madame Yankelova,
today we shall tell a different story.

482
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,540
A fairy tale, if you will.

483
01:12:49,660 --> 01:12:53,660
Once upon a time,
there was an aging librarian

484
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:56,500
who didn't believe in love.

485
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:01,300
One day, she met
a handsome man who seduced her

486
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,980
and made her believe
that true love really exists.

487
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:09,860
She was ready to sacrifice
all her friends for him.

488
01:13:09,940 --> 01:13:12,260
Friends who did everything for her.

489
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,100
And all for what ?

490
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:18,260
To find out that he's one
of my detectives.

491
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,940
The detective I sent to catch Hannah,

492
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:25,900
the same who thought
"love" would save her.

493
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:28,140
Who thought she could betray us.

494
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:38,180
Any last words ?

495
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:45,380
Love is a four-letter word,
two lovers and one whole heart.

496
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,460
Hang them.

497
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:49,860
Hannah !

498
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:04,500
And back to our story. Our librarian
was blinded by love's temptations.

499
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:10,100
She was ready to betray us, ready
to destroy everything we believe in.

500
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,540
Don't believe me ?

501
01:14:19,620 --> 01:14:22,340
Would you run away for true love ?

502
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:24,940
For true love ?

503
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,060
I would run all the way to the moon.

504
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,900
So forgive me this time,
my dear Lola,

505
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:40,500
but despite you being the one
who brought to the club,

506
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:45,020
I would like to announce the winner
of our "Woman of the Week" competition.

507
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:49,620
The woman who helped
us capture Hannah,

508
01:14:49,740 --> 01:14:53,820
the woman who got to come
to our club,

509
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:57,380
for the 100th time,

510
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,900
The "Woman of the Week" is...

511
01:15:02,020 --> 01:15:04,300
Sophie !

512
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,900
Now Sophie,

513
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:24,580
after learning first-hand, again,
that there is no love in this world,

514
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:28,020
you have one last chance
to be forgiven

515
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,740
and join the esteemed
House of Lordesses.

516
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:42,620
Sophie...

517
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,420
Sophie...

518
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,150
Listen to me...

519
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,980
- Any last words, Yosef ?
- Sophie...

520
01:15:55,940 --> 01:15:59,460
Sophie, I beg you, Sophie...

521
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:02,100
Take the picture out of my pocket.

522
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:06,700
Take the picture out
of my pocket, Sophie.

523
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:09,500
Take the picture out of my pocket.

524
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,140
Look at the picture.

525
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,220
That is my father.

526
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,660
He disappeared when I was a baby.

527
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:20,820
I'm sorry Sophie, I had to lie to you.

528
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:24,420
It was my only chance to get here today
and find out what happened to him.

529
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:27,980
Such pleasant memories.

530
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:31,780
Yes, Yosef, your father
was a very handsome man.

531
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:36,180
I think it was my 36th trophy.
Am I right, Madame Yankelova ?

532
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,540
- Another "love" story.
- Don't listen to her, Sophie.

533
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,140
Don't listen to her.

534
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,500
I didn't lie
when I said that I'd run...

535
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,580
All the way to the moon !

536
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,820
Journeys through space.

537
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:52,460
Around the world in 80 days.

538
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:57,100
Make a decision,
it's either you, or the "Don Juan."

539
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:01,340
Sophie...

540
01:17:23,980 --> 01:17:25,980
Let him go.

541
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,140
Release him.

542
01:17:32,700 --> 01:17:33,900
You...

543
01:17:33,980 --> 01:17:36,300
You will pay for this.

544
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:06,220
Come, follow me, I know...

545
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:12,460
Is there any chance
you can roll that barrel over ?

546
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:20,220
Go.

547
01:19:20,300 --> 01:19:22,300
Run !

548
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:53,980
