cast:

13
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,319
Blackbird! Warbler! Gee up!
For the love of God!

14
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,239
You are in a bad mood today.

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,799
What's wrong, Tóbiás?
Run out of horsepower?

16
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,239
They're low on petrol but
I'll soon fire them up!

17
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,759
Tell me when those fat
sausages start to move!

18
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,719
This sausage could kick you out
of that tin can.

19
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,759
- Hey, hey!
- Hey, hey!

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,479
I hope you can see, Father, that
we could sell those two horses.

21
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,399
Leave them alone.
Your great-great grandfather

22
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,239
couldn't have set up this firm
without them.

23
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,479
- Remember, mankind...
- I know!

24
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,679
...can thank horses for its culture.

25
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,679
If Hannibal took an army of men
on horseback to Moscow?

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,239
Papa, that wasn't Hannibal.

27
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,559
- Then who?
- Napoleon.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,039
- Who?
- Napoleon.

29
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,159
He didn't take a taxi either!

30
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,479
Take a look at that!

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,759
Poor animals!

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:23,239
Don't feel sorry for the horses!
It's theirjob.

33
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,079
Come in!

34
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,439
Good morning!

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,719
What's to report, Benedek?

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,639
There's a mistake in the
calculation for the poultry delivery.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,719
How many times have I said that
Terka sees to international work?

38
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,319
Yes, sorry,
but this is a local delivery...

39
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,239
Oh, local? Really?

40
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,719
- She does them too!
- Let me have a look at that!

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,839
Sorry, but I think
the first mistake is here.

42
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,839
I'm sorry

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,839
but the first mistake is that you
are in these dreadful clothes again.

44
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,799
Really.

45
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,999
And there is a discrepancy
of 100 pengõ here.

46
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,079
That really is too much!
You haven't even shaved!

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,239
True!

48
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,239
What do you want from this man?

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,799
- A manager really can't walk around
looking like this! - No!

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,959
Wear formal attire tomorrow.
Do you own any spurs?

51
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,039
- Indeed I do!
- Grand! Put them on!

52
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,719
Don't come in here again
without your spurs on!

53
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,039
Go and look for the original order!

54
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,719
Of course! May I?

55
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,839
I know that ring...

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,839
It's your mother...

57
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,439
Oh, mother!

58
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:49,439
Hello!
Hello, Mama!

59
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,159
Hello, Mama! What's that, Mama?
What about Terka? Yes...

60
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,399
Your mother wants to have
a word with you.

61
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,999
Hello!
What are you playing at, Terka?

62
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,799
Our dear friend Makáts has been
sitting here waiting for you

63
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,119
for half an hour.

64
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,239
Half an hour and two minutes,
madam, if you will allow me.

65
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,119
But I could sit for eternity
for Miss Terka.

66
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,999
Very good!

67
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,359
How nice...

68
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,399
But you promised to come home early!

69
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,399
Tell him that I am busy.

70
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,399
You could also tell him
to leave me alone.

71
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,839
Yes...

72
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,159
My daughter sends her warm regards.

73
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,359
It' my honour, madam...

74
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,999
You make me so happy.

75
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,159
And did Miss Terka say nothing else?

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,239
Oh, but she did.

77
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,159
She did?
And what did she say if I may ask?

78
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,319
No... I don't want you to blush,
Mr Makáts.

79
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:52,159
Oh, madam, I am flattered...

80
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,639
- My modesty forbids...
- When are you coming home?

81
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,239
- But you had plans to play tennis.
- I am far too busy, Mother.

82
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,719
Tell that Mr Makáts not to wait.

83
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,239
What do you mean he shouldn't wait?
He has to wait! Hello! Hello!

84
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,079
Oh, she's put the telephone down.

85
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,519
For the love of God, understand

86
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,719
that the rubbish business
depends on Makáts's uncle.

87
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,519
If we get it, you'll be
a very rich girl.

88
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
I don't believe
in this concession at all.

89
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,599
- I do!
- You play tennis with him then!

90
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,199
Tennis?
Is that a sport?

91
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,799
He can play me at cards,
if he dares! I'll thrash him!

92
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,639
How are you playing?
I opened with a quart

93
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,639
and I'll start with one hundred
and thirty!

94
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,959
You can't play with that!

95
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,199
A round, a round!

96
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,799
Jozsi! A round of drinks!

97
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,319
A round for Mr Schneider!

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,359
It isn't so easy to be a driver,
you know.

99
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
A driver depends on two things:

100
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,999
- his horse and his boss.
- True.

101
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,439
Well you can always get
on with a horse

102
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,679
because the beast has got a brain...

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,479
- But a boss like...
- Right you are...

104
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,879
There you go, Tóbiás.

105
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,239
You see? It's the sixth
beer that he's bought for me

106
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,039
when he knows that I don't like beer.

107
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,119
You really could invite us
over sometime.

108
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,639
He could but his wife
wouldn't let him!

109
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,119
We're not...
We're not posh enough.

110
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,279
My wife?
Am I afraid of my own wife?

111
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,679
I say what goes in my own house.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,919
It's seven o'clock.
We should be going!

113
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,239
What do you mean?
I still have a beer to drink.

114
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,399
I wouldn't.
It'll lead to trouble.

115
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,919
I want another beer!

116
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,319
Should I ignore the mistress's orders?

117
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,359
He can find himself another
job tomorrow because

118
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,239
I'm going to sack him.

119
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,239
All I am saying is that it
would be best to hurry.

120
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,799
Shut up because it looks like
I'm going to sack you in the morning.

121
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,159
- You're too late. He can't
hear you. - But I told him.

122
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,119
He can't complain because
I've told him now.

123
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,639
Right you are!
Don't you give in!

124
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:05,799
- Do I give in? Do I ever give in?
- You shouldn't.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,799
- But I'll have to be going!
- You're scared of your wife!

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,959
Mátyás, you're scared of your wife!

127
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,959
I want to go now and that's different.
If I want to go, I go.

128
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,679
But, Chairman,
another glass...

129
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,839
- Long live the chairman!
- Hear! Hear!

130
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,919
Song Slaughterers on deck!
Maestro!

131
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,879
One, two, three...

132
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,679
Oh, beer is a drink to sing about...

133
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,919
But not that wine should be
left out...

134
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,079
I don't want a butler.
I want a chambermaid!

135
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,799
Oh, heavens!
Who has a chambermaid nowadays?

136
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:17,959
- A respectable household has to have
a butler. - Yes, yes.

137
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,759
But...

138
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,159
This butler served
27 years for a count.

139
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,679
Really?

140
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,479
Good evening, sir!

141
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,079
Very well then!

142
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,479
Is the table laid?

143
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,119
- Not yet, sir!
- Not yet?

144
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,639
- Not laid at seven o'clock?
- But, sir, the mistress...

145
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,999
- And?
- He'll be there in half an hour.

146
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,079
- Good day to you.
- Good day!

147
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,559
Your servant, sir.

148
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,439
- Who was that old fiddler?
- He's the maid agent.

149
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,239
- Mama, you don't want
another maid. - I do.

150
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,439
- You can't have
enough maids. - Why not? Why not?

151
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,159
It only takes one
to get supper in time.

152
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,079
I need two!

153
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,719
- One is too many for me.
- Leave me alone!

154
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,839
Papa, I don't like the way that girl

155
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,679
takes so long
saying goodbye to Istvan Benedek.

156
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,399
Me neither. I'm starving
and she just stands there talking.

157
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,479
Thinking about your stomach?

158
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,919
What should I think about?
It's half past seven already!

159
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,759
He's still just a common driver,
who...

160
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,799
That driver is now a manager
and the company owes him a great deal.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,479
Madam, Miss Terka is here.

162
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,639
- At last! Where is she?
- She's gone to her room.

163
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,599
Julcsa, what is for supper?

164
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,239
Cold roast goose, sir.

165
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,439
Bring a couple of spring onions
with it...

166
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,159
and a couple of sprung ones too!

167
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,279
Onions with goose?!
But, sir!

168
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,839
What will the mistress say?!

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,479
I'll turn away when I talk to her.

170
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,919
Good day!

171
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,159
- Who are you visiting?
- I want to see Mr Schneider.

172
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,039
- Is he at home?
- Yes, he's at home.

173
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,399
- Announce me, if you will.
- What should I do?

174
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,679
Go in and all you have to say
is "Hyppolit"!

175
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,759
- What should I say?
- All you have to say is "Hyppolit".

176
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,359
I can say it if you insist!

177
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,119
Where's the supper?
And where's Terka?

178
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,479
- That girl is so unreliable.
- Let her be.

179
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,639
I've told you that I won't have
onions on the table!

180
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:18,319
No, I'll eat goose with violets
and anemones from now on.

181
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,199
Hippodrome!

182
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,799
- What?
- Hippodrome!

183
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,639
What's that?

184
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,959
There's a man outside who said
I should come in and say "Hippodrome"!

185
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,199
- But what's his name?
- I don't know.

186
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,799
- All he said was "Hippodrome".
- Do you mean Hyppolit?

187
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,519
You could say it like that
but there'd be no point.

188
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,479
Very well.
Tell him to come in.

189
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,959
Mama, who is Hyppolit?

190
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,199
I forgot to tell you
that I've employed a butler.

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,999
- A butler?
- Yes, I wanted it to be a surprise.

192
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,439
- It is!
- I hope you're not angry, Papa!

193
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,079
I'm not. Why should I be?

194
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,679
I'll kick him out so hard,
he'll fly!

195
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,839
You won't.

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,199
You'll put yourjacket on. You can't
greet him like this.

197
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,639
He served a count for 27 years.

198
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,239
He won't work here that long.

199
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,319
- But, Papa!
- Leave it to me.

200
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,639
Madam...

201
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,439
Sir!

202
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,519
- No... it's in my pocket.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,599
Thank you.

204
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,239
Please take a seat.

205
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,239
Thank you.

206
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,519
You say something too!

207
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,559
- So, you are going to be joining us?
- At your service!

208
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,359
Why did you leave the count?

209
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,599
There was a conflict of interest...

210
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,039
- Financial?
- Oh, no.

211
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,759
Money was never
an issue in the count's house.

212
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,159
You see.

213
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,639
Because one would never
ask for more than one is worth.

214
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,999
It isn't worth discussing.

215
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,039
Good.
Let's not talk about it.

216
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,679
He must be a real gentleman,
Julcsa.

217
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,079
I've got an eye for things like that.

218
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,559
If only we could travel to places
like this together.

219
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,079
Paris, Berlin, Rome...

220
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,439
Bruxelles...

221
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,919
...and Soroksar.

222
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,279
We can't travel the whole world.

223
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,239
If you'll excuse me, I would like
to note down your daily timetable.

224
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,639
When does the master wish
to take his bath?

225
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,359
Sunday...

226
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,559
and Monday.

227
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,559
- At what time?
- Eight o'clock.

228
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,799
And for the rest of the week?

229
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,279
A quarter to nine.

230
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,439
Do you prefer a hot or a cold bath?

231
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
A bit of this
and a bit of that.

232
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,399
Madam, when does your masseur
usually arrive?

233
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,239
- Who?
- The masseur.

234
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,439
You know,
he comes every day.

235
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,039
Oh, yes... him, ah, him, he comes.

236
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,759
- At nine.
- Nine at night.

237
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,719
Morning!

238
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,239
And in the morning!
If he promises to come, he comes.

239
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,399
Of course madam keeps
to a diet.

240
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,599
I beg your pardon?

241
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,159
- Weight control.
- Oh yes, of course.

242
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,999
I will monitor the diet.
I am strict.

243
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,119
The countess did the same.

244
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,679
She would eat lettuce and cucumber
for two weeks

245
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,799
and for breakfast nothing more

246
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,719
than a slice of toast
with no butter and an apple.

247
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,039
No butter and an apple...

248
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,839
I can reassure you, madam,
that I am merciless in such matters.

249
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,719
Quite right.
That's what she needs.

250
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,599
Tóbiás...

251
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,919
I think that the strange man
came today because of Terka.

252
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,959
- Don't be so silly, Julcsa.
- You'll see.

253
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,879
There'll be a wedding here
before too long.

254
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,399
- Yes... - We're not refined
enough for that, Julcsa.

255
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,799
And small changes in the house,
don't you agree?

256
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,159
We have complete faith in you,
Hyppolit,

257
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,839
as a few small things need changing.

258
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,759
Because the furniture,
you see...

259
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:05,919
We will replace the furniture.
Is Italian Renaissance suitable?

260
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,159
- Italian?
- Resonance?

261
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,639
Or Baroque?
It is a very popular style.

262
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,319
And we will need more staff!

263
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,319
So, as I said, discretion, discipline,
and courtesy.

264
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,559
White gloves?

265
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,959
Very good.

266
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,919
The mistress's diet
is to be strictly controlled.

267
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,079
- Crooked!
- What is?

268
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,119
Shave every day!

269
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,439
The master will soon be home.

270
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,279
Thank you!

271
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,479
Madam...

272
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,399
Thank you!

273
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,599
Does madam find everything
to her satisfaction?

274
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,399
Oh, I am simply delighted,
dear Hyppolit.

275
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,959
The house, the furniture...
the staff... everything is superb.

276
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,799
I trust the master will be happy
with the new fixtures and fittings.

277
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,239
Oh, he is sure to be delighted.

278
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,759
What do you want with my hat?

279
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,119
- Who are you?
- I'm the new second footman.

280
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,959
- What?
- Second footman.

281
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,759
And where are the coat hooks?

282
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,719
The cloakroom's in the basement.

283
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,719
Cloakroom?
Are we in a theatre or something?

284
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,239
Who are you looking for?

285
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,359
Tell me, sweetheart,
am I at the right address?

286
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,039
- This is the Schneider villa,
isn't it? - It is, sir.

287
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,559
Tóbiás, is that you?

288
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,799
- What's happened to you?
- Hippodrome.

289
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,919
Please hurry, Mátyás!
The souppé is served at nine.

290
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,399
- What will happen to what?
- The souppé is served.

291
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,159
And it is time you changed.

292
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,879
Get changed?
Why should I get changed?

293
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,919
What do you look like, Mama?
Are we going to a ball?

294
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,199
No but I got dressed
for the souppé.

295
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,599
And you have to put
your dinner suit on.

296
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,759
Me in a dinner suit?
Are you mad?

297
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,639
Ask Hyppolit.
The count dresses for dinner...

298
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,279
I'm not a count and I'm not
interested.

299
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,879
Mátyás, go and put
your dinner suit on!

300
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,639
Listen here, Mama!

301
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,439
You have thrown out my furniture

302
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,879
and I don't recognise my own home,
fine!

303
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,639
You call supper, souppé,
fine.

304
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,919
Now you call me Mátyás, fine.

305
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,159
But put a dinner suit on
to honour my own beef stew? Never!

306
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,119
Understand, Mama, never!

307
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,759
And I am going to kick
Hyppolit out!

308
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,999
But Hyppolit knows about etiquette.

309
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,959
Etiquette, etti... Oh!

310
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,039
There'll be no dinner suit tonight!

311
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,239
Hyppolit!
There'll be no dinner suit.

312
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,999
Sir.

313
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,919
Dear Terka,

314
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,439
don't do that!

315
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,039
Can't you see that I want
to talk to you?

316
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,639
No!

317
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,239
Thank you, sir, for loving me,

318
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,639
and foryour protecting me.

319
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,479
But don't send me flowers again, sir.

320
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,439
Thank you, sir, foryour kindness,

321
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,479
but it might not be time, as

322
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,079
my heart belongs to another.

323
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:57,159
But why should I keep up
this foolish pretence,

324
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,799
when we can say farewell
like two dearest friends?

325
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,639
Thank you, sir, for loving me,

326
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,519
and foryour protecting me.

327
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,639
But don't send me flowers again, sir.

328
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,119
A waltz says more than words can say.

329
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,679
It steals a lady's heart away.

330
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,879
A good Hawaii blues,

331
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,039
that makes me choose you today.

332
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:49,719
Rich music, wonder and delight,

333
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:54,159
a dance and a kiss
to complete the night.

334
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:01,639
It takes nothing more for it
all to be right.

335
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,039
She thanks me for loving her,

336
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,519
and for my protecting her.

337
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,719
But don't send me flowers again, sir.

338
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,919
She thanks me for my kindness,

339
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,519
though it might not be time, as

340
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:32,159
her heart belongs to another.

341
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:39,999
But why should I keep up
this foolish pretence,

342
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:48,679
when we can say farewell
like two dearest friends?

343
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,519
Thank you, sir, for loving me,

344
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,199
and you're your protecting me.

345
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:06,319
But don't send me flowers again,
sir.

346
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,119
- Tóbiás, there's trouble.
- What?

347
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,519
The mistress
has just told Mr Hyppolit

348
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,999
to throw Mr Benedek
out if he arrives.

349
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,119
That... Mr Benedek is here.

350
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,279
Who might I?

351
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,039
Mister Engineer, sir?

352
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,079
You must be confusing me
with someone.

353
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:51,559
I couldn't help recognise
the young count's best friend.

354
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,559
Please, not a word to anybody,
Hyppolit.

355
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,999
I hope I can count
on your discretion.

356
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,759
As you wish, sir.

357
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,399
No engineer,
only Istvan Benedek the driver,

358
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,839
or, if you like, manager.

359
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,719
A driver with a degree
on engineering?

360
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:11,919
The degree isn't important but
a good driver can always find work.

361
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,239
I understand, sir.

362
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,399
Miss Terka really is very pretty.

363
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,559
Dear Hyppolit, I think you go
to the cinema too often.

364
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,799
I'm sorry, Mister Engineer,

365
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,799
...Mister Manager.

366
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,839
The manager.

367
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,839
- Good day, Benedek.
- Miss.

368
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,519
- Are the files here?
- Yes, just as you asked.

369
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,359
- Let's go into the conservatory.
- Very well.

370
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,199
Hyppolit, tell Papa that

371
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,039
- Mr Makáts is waiting for him.
- Yes, miss.

372
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,319
Have you seen
the Kazilitzky furniture?

373
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,399
Yes, I have.

374
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,719
- After you. - We need
to calculate the number of trucks.

375
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,479
The dining furniture
will need an 8-metre truck.

376
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,919
It's all very cumbersome.
French Baroque and German Renaissance.

377
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,159
I'm sorry?

378
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,039
French Baroque and German Renaissance.

379
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,359
And the bedroom has a Louis XV,

380
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,799
beautiful, large bed.
For two.

381
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,559
It must be beautiful.

382
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,359
And there is a painting above the bed:
"Faun with Protesting Nymph".

383
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,319
And there's the collection
of Murano glass.

384
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,479
How do you know about such things
as Murano and Renaissance?

385
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,239
And why have you come to a business
meeting dressed as a marquis?

386
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,639
I apologise.
This is really a very plain suit.

387
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,239
Really? Please continue.

388
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,479
That's nothing!
Listen to this.

389
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,119
The teacher is explaining
something in the classroom

390
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,479
and sees Moricka's mouth
is wide open.

391
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,479
"Moricka, your mouth's open!"

392
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,639
"I know, sir, I left it open. "

393
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,759
Each better than the last.

394
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,479
Interesting.

395
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,199
That dress is so simple,
so sweet, and so feminine.

396
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,399
Nowwhere were we?

397
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,839
Yes.

398
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:27,039
So the Louis XV large, wide bed

399
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,119
and the collection
of Murano glass that...

400
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,799
That was enough for today.

401
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,599
- We will continue tomorrow morning.
- As you wish.

402
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,119
That's nothing. I've got another.

403
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,199
- Another?
- Yes.

404
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,359
A Jew is travelling on the train.

405
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,719
But they have beards this long.

406
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,479
No, he was clean-shaven.

407
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,319
You have missed a great deal.
Mr Makáts has been telling jokes.

408
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,239
I can imagine.

409
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,719
Dinner is served.

410
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,039
At last! The first intelligent
word this evening.

411
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,439
One, two, three, four.

412
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,679
One, two... three, four...

413
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,919
- Enough! We're finished!
- Thank God for that!

414
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,719
Nowwe'll pick up a little paper.

415
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,599
- Couldn't we have a short break?
- Heavens, no!

416
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,759
Madam has gained
a little weight this week.

417
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,679
Knees straight when we bend.

418
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,199
Hyppolit, do I have to?

419
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,559
- Well, the count does.
- Alright... I know, I know.

420
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,879
And it is madam's wish.

421
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,439
Very well.

422
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,839
One at a time, please.

423
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,839
Please finish while I am changing
but one at a time!

424
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,239
Mr Schneider, I'm here with the...

425
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,119
- Mr Schneider!
- Hippodrome.

426
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,359
This would be too much work
even for an ant.

427
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,079
Allow me.

428
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,159
What is that red stuff?

429
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,879
- Beetroot?
- Salmon.

430
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:59,079
- Good. And the red?
- That's salmon.

431
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,799
Interesting. Only a couple of months
ago it was beetroot.

432
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,839
- Thanks God, I'm finished!
- Congratulations.

433
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,079
I hope I've earned my breakfast.

434
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,039
Yes, but
just an apple and nothing else.

435
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,119
- Bon appetite, Father!
- Thank you.

436
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,839
Terka, what do you think
this red stuff is?

437
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,639
Salmon!

438
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,879
- How do you know?
- Well...

439
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,439
Children today...

440
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,479
I've asked Benedek here.

441
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,919
If I'm late,
make him comfortable.

442
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,039
- Alright.
- And offer him a little breakfast.

443
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,919
Salmon!

444
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,119
- Good morning, Mama!
- Good morning!

445
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,359
Mama, what do you think
that red stuff is?

446
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:55,279
- Salmon.
- Mama, you're going to laugh at me.

447
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,119
I always thought salmon was a fish.

448
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,799
- It is.
- Really?

449
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,759
Aren't you hungry?

450
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,559
No, I'm not hungry.

451
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,719
Eat something.

452
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,799
A little mouthful won't do any harm.

453
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,559
Your apple, madam.

454
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,559
Mátyás,
I think that'll be enough, my dear.

455
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,879
But, Mama, I've had my...

456
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,079
Very well,
I'll eat a few more bites.

457
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,279
- Mr Istvan Benedek is here.
- Tell him to come in!

458
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,759
No! I'll go out!

459
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,079
Mr Benedek!

460
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,399
- Good day, madam.
- Please take a seat.

461
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,039
Thank you.

462
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,439
Where is Miss Terka?
Terka? In the country.

463
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,959
In the country?

464
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,679
- She asked me here.
- Really?

465
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,759
She is with Mr Makáts, who...

466
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,599
And they are sure
to announce it soon that...

467
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,439
I see!

468
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,839
- So Miss Terka and Mr Makáts...
- Yes.

469
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:26,199
He'll soon be your boss!
He'll be joining the company.

470
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,639
Congratulations!

471
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,999
What is it, Mr Benedek,
do you have news?

472
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,399
Nothing new.

473
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,239
Only that I left the company today.

474
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,039
You sent that fine, young man away?

475
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,359
I can imagine what Terka will say.

476
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,119
Leave it to me.

477
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,599
- Give me that sandwich!
- Sandwich? You?

478
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,439
Not a crumb!

479
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:07,439
May I know your plans
for the evening?

480
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,919
We're having
paprika chicken, aren't we?

481
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,399
I mean do you intend to stay at home

482
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,679
or do you prefer
to appreciate the arts?

483
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,279
What? What?

484
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,999
Gentlemen of a certain age
are great supporters of the arts.

485
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,079
- The what?
- The arts.

486
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,479
Yes, they are...
They are that.

487
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,599
Might I have the lady's address
and name?

488
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,199
What lady?

489
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,359
I always arranged flowers
for the count

490
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,999
- and small tokens.
- Yes, very well. Yes.

491
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,879
The lady's name?

492
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,039
Erm... Erm...

493
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,599
Mimi?

494
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,199
- Erm... Mimi?
- Mimi.

495
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,279
Mimi.

496
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,799
A fiery redhead...

497
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,599
She was Baron Rappaport's girlfriend
last year.

498
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,599
- I trust I am well informed.
- Yes, yes. Better than me.

499
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,479
I know the lady.

500
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,079
- Her telephone number...
- What is it? What is it then?

501
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,199
435-15.

502
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,359
435... And?

503
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,319
- 15.
- Correct.

504
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,119
- I'll call her right now.
- No! God forbid, no!

505
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,919
This is a respectful house.

506
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,959
We don't call any women from here!

507
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,039
As you wish.

508
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,959
Unheard of!

509
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,439
Hello! 435-15.

510
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,279
What are you eating, Tóbiás?

511
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,199
- Madam.
- Stay as you are!

512
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,759
I brought it from the Rezeda Tavern.

513
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,519
- My stomach can't take
the French cuisine here. - Why?

514
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,359
- It's too light for me.
- For me too.

515
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,679
You see, madam,
that's what a goose leg looks like.

516
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,839
And they do wonderful roasted
potatoes!

517
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,359
I had a platter there...

518
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:15,359
- with bacon and all the trimmings.
- Tóbiás!

519
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,039
So will I see you?

520
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,519
This evening?

521
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,359
Where?

522
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,039
The Hummingbird Bar?

523
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,839
Again. The Hummingbird Bar. Yes.

524
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:34,039
But it would be better
to meet in the lounge...

525
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,239
Yes, Councillor...
Yes, Councillor. I'll be there!

526
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,479
What a charming scent!

527
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,679
- What is it?
- "L'heure bleue".

528
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,879
- What?
- L'heure bleue.

529
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,479
Yes.

530
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,599
Might I know your plans
for the evening?

531
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,479
- Do you intend to stay in or?
- No, I shall be going out.

532
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,839
- The theatre perhaps?
- Yes, the opera.

533
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,759
"Tosca" is playing.
The left proscenium box is the best.

534
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,599
- The count always took it.
- Really?

535
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:15,919
- Might I recommend it?
- Thank you kindly.

536
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,639
I don't understand.
Benedek was here?

537
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,759
- He was but he left.
- And when is he coming back?

538
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,519
I don't think
he's coming back at all.

539
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,519
What happened?!

540
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,399
I don't know.
I don't want to interfere...

541
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,519
Your mother spoke to him
and he left.

542
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,079
I think your mother
chased him away.

543
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,959
- And you let her?!
- Me?

544
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,959
Well, he left...

545
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,159
I took the liberty of reserving
a box at the opera

546
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:50,839
for yourself
and Mr Makáts this evening.

547
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,999
Thank you.

548
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,119
Take that watering can out of here.
I can't stand it!

549
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,239
Hyppolit! What happened to Mr Benedek?

550
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:04,399
I think that there was
a difference of opinion...

551
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,159
between the mistress
and the engineer.

552
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:10,959
- Engineer?
- I meant manager.

553
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:13,399
But you just said "engineer'.

554
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,879
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said that.

555
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,239
Really? You shouldn't have.

556
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:34,679
Mr Benedek,
a lady is here to see you.

557
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,799
- Me?
- Yes.

558
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,159
- Who?
- She didn't give her name.

559
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,599
Let her in.

560
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,319
- Miss Terka!
- Good evening, Mister Engineer, sir!

561
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,359
- Engineer? So you know.
- Yes but that's not why I'm here.

562
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,759
- I came to discuss business.
- Of course.

563
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:04,879
You resigned and we have accepted
your resignation.

564
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,599
Your pay is 348 pengõ 16 fillér
with all deductions.

565
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,119
Here's the receipt, sign it please.

566
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,319
- Of course.
- I have the cheque with me.

567
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,439
The only thing to finalise
is the poultry delivery.

568
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,239
Thank you.

569
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,839
You were right, there is
a mistake in the calculations.

570
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,519
I think the first one is here...

571
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:33,279
No, the first mistake is that
I forgot to congratulate you.

572
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,279
- Me? What for?
- Your engagement.

573
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:37,599
Who told you that?

574
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,199
- Bring me a platter with
all the trimmings. - Yes, madam.

575
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,719
- Goose liver pâté to start.
- Pâté.

576
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,119
Then sweet dumplings
with lots of cream.

577
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,839
Dumplings with cream.

578
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,199
Then cheese, fruit, cake with
more cream, and black coffee.

579
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,239
It would seem that a happy marriage

580
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,639
needs a good rubbish collection
concession.

581
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,879
You're right there.

582
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,799
I don't think I have anything
further to say.

583
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,759
Good bye.

584
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,479
- Terka?
- Do you want to say something?

585
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,359
Do you think I'll let you go
just like that?

586
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,919
I signed the receipt
but I didn't get the cheque.

587
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,919
There!

588
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,879
Cheerio, sweetheart, cheerio.

589
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,519
It's the end of the show,
and I have to go.

590
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,719
Oh, don't be so sad.
No, it's not that bad.

591
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,559
But I've got a new beau.

592
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,599
No need for sorrow.

593
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:26,079
I'll write a note though,
and post it to you tomorrow.

594
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,879
Cheerio, sweetheart, cheerio.

595
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,199
It's the end of the show,

596
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,639
and I have to go.

597
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:39,759
Love's not such a tragedy.
It's just how it had to be.

598
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,039
There'll be another girl soon, so

599
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,039
No need to make a big seen.
Don't think what could have been.

600
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,119
Our love made a beautiful tune, oh!

601
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,959
Cheerio, sweetheart, cheerio.

602
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,519
It's the end of the show,

603
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,439
and I have to go...

604
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,879
Good evening...

605
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,719
Mr Schneider!
You said you were going to the opera!

606
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,719
- Yes, somewhere with music.
- Yes.

607
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,599
- And you?
- Doctors order.

608
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,799
What are you doing here?

609
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,799
- It's important.
- Is it?

610
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,999
- I have to support the arts.
- Where is she?

611
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:49,039
- She'll be here in a minute.
- Ah, little Mimi?

612
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:52,559
I'll help you with the support
if you want.

613
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,839
- Hello, Mimi, hello.
- Good evening.

614
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,039
My dear, please allow me...

615
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,439
Waiter!
Quickly...

616
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,039
Here you are, madam.

617
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,719
- Dear Makáts.
- Yes.

618
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,239
You have to get me out of trouble
tomorrow.

619
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,119
Yes.

620
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,879
You know my wife is a little
difficult about such things.

621
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,919
I understand.
I'll organise everything.

622
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:33,199
I'll come over tomorrow morning

623
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:36,719
and there'll be no trouble
if I'm there.

624
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,519
I'm so drunk

625
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,039
that everyone looks like a monkey.
I swear.

626
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,799
Mimi! Makáts!

627
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,319
We'll meet here tomorrow at nine...

628
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:53,279
in the Hummingbrird...

629
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,359
Humm... Bumminghird Bar.

630
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,559
- Hummingbird.
- Good... Good.

631
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,079
Rendez-vous at nine!

632
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:06,479
Alright, sunshine.
A date is a date!

633
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,119
Oh...

634
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,439
Morning, Mama.

635
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,279
What's wrong with you?

636
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,719
- Are you ill?
- Very ill.

637
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,639
My head, my stomach.

638
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,039
It's that stupid diet.

639
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,039
- You think so?
- Definitely.

640
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,719
- I think so too.
- Yes.

641
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,279
I don't feel so good either.

642
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,039
- In fact, last night...
- Oh, the opera...

643
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,279
There... there... yes, there.

644
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:44,839
No, not there...

645
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,239
There or thereabouts.

646
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,159
I couldn't go.

647
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,679
- What? Didn't you go to the opera?
- You know.

648
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:57,159
I know alright but I just wanted
to hear from you.

649
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:00,239
- What did Makáts say?
- He was distraught.

650
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,639
Distraught.

651
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,239
It was bad to look at him.

652
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,239
I need to talk to him.

653
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,559
I need to make your apologies...

654
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,639
- Are you sure you weren't
at the opera? - Sure.

655
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,559
I'm saying that you weren't there.
It's a funny thing...

656
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:24,239
It is very unfortunate, madam,

657
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,039
that you weren't able
to enjoy the music last night.

658
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,199
It really wasn't fair
on the audience.

659
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,639
CITY OPERA HOUSE.

660
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,559
"Tosca" was cancelled last night
as Tita Buffo had a sore throat.

661
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,319
Tickets can be refunded or exchanged.

662
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,759
Unbelievable!

663
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,039
Julcsa!

664
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:56,159
Listen to me or you're fired.

665
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,479
If Mr Makáts comes, tell him:

666
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:03,439
Mr Makáts! Whatever happens,
you went to the opera last night.

667
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,119
Repeat after me!

668
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,639
Julcsa!

669
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,719
Listen to me or you're fired!

670
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,959
No that bit. Mr Makáts...

671
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,039
Mr Makáts...
Whatever happens...

672
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:18,039
you went to the opera last night.

673
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,319
Stay here and don't move
until he arrives.

674
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,879
- How did Tita Buffo sing?
- You've never heard anything like it.

675
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,079
I'm sure, but you heard it!

676
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,159
But of course!
It was glorious.

677
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,919
- Really?
- Yes. And especially when Tosca

678
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:43,879
attacked the other one with a dagger.
You know...

679
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,919
The one who was with...

680
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,319
She said,

681
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,439
"Cheerio, sweetheart, cheerio.

682
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:52,839
It's the end of the show,
and I have... "

683
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,759
- Then she stabbed him.
- Tosca?!

684
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,439
- The other one.
- With a sore throat?

685
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,119
Sore?

686
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,959
I wish I could sing
with her sore throat.

687
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,719
Really?

688
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,159
Good morning, Julcsa.

689
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,159
Mr Makáts...
whatever happens,

690
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,919
you went to the opera
last night or I'm fired.

691
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:27,839
What?

692
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,399
Mr Schneider said that Mr Makáts,

693
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,359
whatever happens,
went to the opera last night.

694
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,359
- Last night?
- The opera.

695
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,239
The opera. I understand.

696
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,439
I'm going to get
to the bottom of this.

697
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,999
Madam.

698
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,559
Madam,

699
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:50,639
- the opera was wonderful last night.
- Really?

700
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,799
I have heard a lot of opera
in my life but none like this.

701
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,719
- Really?
- Really.

702
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,239
The applause. Oh, the applause!

703
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,439
The reviews were wonderful.

704
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,079
That tenor has such a glorious voice!

705
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,399
He hit the top C with such...

706
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,079
And the low notes were beautiful too.

707
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,919
You're right, Mr Schneider!
The mad scene was sensational.

708
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:21,159
Yes, and when she collapsed...

709
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,879
Don't waste your time.

710
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,879
You didn't go to the opera!

711
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,359
- Madam, but I did.
- You did not.

712
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,279
Mr Makáts, we didn't go to the opera.

713
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,759
Mr Schneider, whatever happens,
I did go to the opera.

714
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,399
- Really?
- Really. - Here.

715
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,559
May I?

716
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,519
Good! Ha-ha.

717
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:56,159
The councillor says he accepts
our invitation.

718
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,239
You see! That's why I wasn't
at the opera last night!

719
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,239
Very good.

720
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:05,239
"I am delighted to accept your
kind invitation. Yours, Makáts"

721
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,639
We were happy to accept
the invitation

722
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:13,599
that brought us to the most prominent

723
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,399
exponent of international delirium.

724
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:18,119
Erm... delivery...

725
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:22,959
To the home of dear Mr Mátyás
Schneider and his charming wife.

726
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:24,799
Hear! Hear!

727
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,879
Transporting furniture, works of art,

728
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,959
meat and fish,

729
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,799
game and poultry,

730
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:39,559
- fruit and greens.
- Cabbage! Very good, ha-ha-ha!

731
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,799
Turkish coffee... Yes, coffee.
So, transporting coffee,

732
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,959
ice-cream and cheese.

733
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:55,039
He delivers a thousand and one
delicious delights

734
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:59,879
to feed the hungry
and he is aided in his efforts

735
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,079
- by his charming daughter.
- Hear! Hear!

736
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,439
Ladies and gentlemen!

737
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:12,479
What a wonderful
and varied life he leads.

738
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,319
I am delighted to be linked to this
excellent man and his family

739
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,999
in such close... family contact.

740
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,959
Yes, family contact.

741
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,479
Hear that? Contract!
The rubbish business is ours.

742
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:31,119
Mátyás Schneider, sir,
I propose a toast...

743
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:33,039
Very good! Ha, ha!

744
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:37,439
I lift my glass to salute
the charming Schneider family!

745
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,519
Hear! Hear!

746
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,839
What do you think of my uncle?
Isn't he a nice man?

747
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,199
Charming!

748
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,519
The Makáts men are all gentlemen.

749
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,119
Yes...
But you are so nice, Terka.

750
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,119
Much nicer than we are.

751
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,119
Really?

752
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,319
And ever since I fell in love
with you,

753
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,519
I have been all in a spin.

754
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:07,119
Sorry, gentlemen, but come
collecting at a later date.

755
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,039
Do you hear?!
What kind of collecting?

756
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,239
We only donate to charity
on Wednesdays...

757
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,319
Just who do you think we are?

758
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,679
I thought you came
from a charity of some sort...

759
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,839
Charity?

760
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:28,319
Beethoven, Beethoven,
did you hear that?

761
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,719
We are serious musicians!

762
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,639
Tell your employer we are here.

763
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,719
Have you tried to call
the Schneider villa?

764
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,639
Mr Schneider is having a party.

765
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,439
Mr Schneider is giving a party?

766
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:04,839
And he leaves me waiting here.
Just one minute!

767
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,439
Crooked.

768
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,239
Tóbiás! In baby clothes...

769
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,239
Don't laugh, Julcsa!

770
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,199
Look!

771
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,399
Oh, I look so ugly!

772
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,439
Hello, boys!
Why don't you come in?

773
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:45,199
I'm sorry, sir, but their dress...

774
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,239
They look so smart.
Especially this one.

775
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,479
We did our best.

776
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:55,239
It's my graduation suit.

777
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,079
- Are you taking the gentlemen
into the drawing room? - Of course!

778
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,359
But, no... of course not...

779
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:06,559
I know a much better place upstairs.
Come on...

780
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,479
Here we are.

781
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,439
It's lovely.

782
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,039
Beautiful.

783
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,679
- This is better...
- Make yourselves comfortable.

784
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,359
- I'll send up food and drink.
- Good.

785
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,639
I second that.

786
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,039
Boys!
Let's play a joke.

787
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,999
When the clock strikes one,

788
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,879
you all come down the stairs...

789
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,039
And the five of you sing
that quartet.

790
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:59,759
I'll pretend to be stupid...

791
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,119
And I'll say:

792
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,599
Stop that!
There's no engagement here.

793
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:09,599
- But don't stop...
- We'll sing the quartet.

794
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,039
Sing the quartet.

795
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,079
It'll be a good joke.

796
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,559
- I'll go down and send food up...
and drink. - Good... good...

797
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,879
Don't forget the wine!

798
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,799
- Beer too.
- Of course.

799
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:26,479
- Beer!
- And cigars!

800
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,239
Where have you been, Mátyás?
What do you say to the good news?

801
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,039
This kind gentleman has just asked
for Terka's hand on Makáts's behalf.

802
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,519
- I have already consented.
- Of course...

803
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,879
- And Terka?
- Oh, Terka? She'll happily say...

804
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,839
No, no, dear Makáts...

805
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:56,959
Dancing is one thing...
but getting married?

806
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,479
- Your boss?
- Mr Schneider is busy with guests.

807
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,239
You can say anything.

808
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,039
Will you call out
your employer or will I go in?

809
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,479
There is no way you can go in, miss!

810
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:09,359
- Then call him out!
- No.

811
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,319
- Then I'll go in.
- Please, no!

812
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,119
- Will you call him?!
- No!

813
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,759
It would be good, Papa, if you
announce the engagement right away.

814
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,239
Isn't that too soon?
The young couple...

815
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,159
No, not at all!

816
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,759
My apologies but duty calls.

817
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,239
Papa, you discuss the details
with this nice man.

818
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,239
Please!

819
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,399
- We are forming family contact...
- Yes, the contract is important.

820
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,679
- The rubbish collection...
- No problem.

821
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,479
So family contact with your puritan

822
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,639
- and highly moral household.
- True, true.

823
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,679
We think morals are important

824
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,239
- because good morals...
- Hello, sunshine!

825
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,039
- Who is this charming lady?
- I don't know her.

826
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:05,239
Hello, Makáts, darling!
How are we?

827
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,439
Good, very good...

828
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,159
It seems I do know her.

829
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,279
You know her?
She's a lady of the world.

830
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,519
- Yes. Half...
- What?

831
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:17,479
I sort of half know her.
Good. He-he-he!

832
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,319
- You're a fool. Sort of half.
- What?

833
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,679
- You here?
- You didn't come to the bar.

834
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,439
There's no bar here.
This is a family house.

835
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,239
Why didn't we meet here?

836
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,719
My wife would have been delighted...

837
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,839
- What do you want? - I want
to bring life to this sad scene.

838
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,319
We've got enough life.
We don't need yours.

839
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,679
- Come on, introduce me to the boys.
- What boys? I can't see any.

840
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,919
They're all boys at heart, sunshine.

841
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,679
Nice to see you.

842
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,199
- Leave! Leave!
- No!

843
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,839
- Go! Get out!
- I'm not!

844
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,159
- No?!
- Don't touch me or I'll scream!

845
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,959
Go or I'll eat you! Leave!
Do you want a scandal?

846
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,239
Bravo, bravo, wonderful!

847
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,199
It's no wonder that guests
are left waiting for the host

848
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,479
you naughty thing!

849
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:08,359
Matyi, introduce me to this gentleman!

850
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,039
- Councillor Makáts.
- Councillor darling.

851
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,799
I didn't know you had such
sweet friends.

852
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,479
I didn't know you had such
a sweet niece.

853
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,799
- Me neither.
- No?

854
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,199
Please make friends.

855
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:23,439
May I offer my arm?

856
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,239
I would be happy to introduce you
to the lady of the house.

857
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,399
Hyppolit! Hyppolit!

858
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,519
Sir?

859
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,919
Nowwhat?

860
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,919
There'll be a scandal, sir.

861
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,719
You say this so lightly?

862
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:49,119
I served the count for 27 years.

863
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:50,719
Tell me, Hyppolit...

864
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,519
What would the count do
at a time like this?

865
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:56,279
The count would do nothing!

866
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,319
And what happened to the woman?

867
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:03,919
The woman flew. His secretary
would normally organise it.

868
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:06,839
But I haven't got a secretary.

869
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,959
A friend or an employee
could organise it.

870
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:14,039
Employee!

871
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:17,559
Thank you, Hyppolit, thank you!

872
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,519
Madam, look at the dear niece
I have with me.

873
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,079
Delighted, I'm sure!
Take a seat if you please.

874
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,239
Why so formal, madam?

875
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:32,279
Oh, please forgive me...

876
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,079
I was confused
in all the commotion.

877
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,039
Do sit down.

878
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:41,079
- A delightful creature!
- Oh, yes.

879
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:42,239
Hello, Benedek?

880
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,119
Come quickly, for God's sake!

881
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,599
If my wife realises
who that woman is...

882
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,959
Yes. Come in a suit,
or a dinnerjacket, or a coat...

883
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,639
You can wear a swimming costume
for all I care but get here soon!

884
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:13,119
The mistress wants to see you now.

885
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,039
Tell me, Hyppolit...

886
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,119
Do you knowwhere my passport is?

887
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,639
Papa, do you see that woman?

888
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:27,919
Mama! I swear I have never met
her before in my life.

889
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:29,919
Then introduce yourself now!

890
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,039
- Why?
- Well, you are the host!

891
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:35,359
Yes, I am the host...
But look, Mama!

892
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,159
No "Mama"! Do you know she is
the councillors niece?

893
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:41,319
- Oh, heaven's!
- What's wrong?

894
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,519
Oh... you know...

895
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,799
I forget who is who
in such a big crowd.

896
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,919
Come and entertain the guests.

897
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,279
Oh, it'll be very entertaining.

898
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,239
Let's rehearse then.

899
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:02,279
- You first!
- After you!

900
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,159
Are you mad?
What's the whistle for?

901
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,439
So he knows where to start...

902
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,839
Dear fellow singer and friend!

903
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,519
No good!

904
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,839
- Dear friend and fellow singer!
- That's better.

905
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,279
At this festive hour,

906
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,719
surrounded by family and friends...

907
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,839
Stop it!
He'll only interrupt you!

908
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,279
And now for the joke.

909
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,559
That niece is sitting
very close to Makáts.

910
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,639
Must be a close relative.

911
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,239
- I don't like it!
- Me neither.

912
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:39,599
But I have organised another suitor.

913
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,079
- He'll get rid of Makáts.
- Who?

914
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,999
What's the problem, Hyppolit?

915
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,959
There appear to be a few
technical problems, sir.

916
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:55,239
- How do you mean?
- Mr Schneider is waiting for you.

917
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,079
- The driver was sacked yesterday.
- Sacked? But he's there!

918
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,399
- Were?
- There. In a suit.

919
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,159
- You're here?
- Welcome, Benedek!

920
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:08,319
It was good of you to come.

921
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:11,079
I have a pretty partner for you.

922
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:15,199
Come with me! We have to discuss
a delivery... I mean a removal.

923
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:20,079
- Mama, what is Benedek doing here?
- Papa invited him.

924
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,639
Papa? How come?

925
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,719
- The councillors niece is very
interested in him. - Really?

926
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,599
They are old friends.

927
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:36,719
If you do that,
you can have whatever you want.

928
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:38,919
I'll take you at your word.

929
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,559
Can I relax?

930
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,799
I'll dance with her
and see what I can do.

931
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,319
What a lovely couple!

932
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,879
Your cousin appears
to be enjoying herself.

933
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:44,439
My cousin? Where?

934
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:48,719
The young lady with the red hair,
dancing with Benedek.

935
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:54,239
She's my cousin?
Very good. Ha-ha!

936
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,239
I suppose Mr Schneider told you that.

937
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,599
Schneider can say what he likes
but I still do as I please.

938
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,639
- How do you like it here?
- Much more now.

939
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,159
Do you knowwhat?
Let's slip away quietly.

940
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,039
With you? Why? Where to?

941
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:16,039
Somewhere we can be alone.

942
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,639
Good!

943
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,119
I'll leave now

944
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:22,839
and wait for you in the car.

945
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:25,839
- Follow me!
- Right.

946
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,319
Makáts, bring me a drink.

947
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,639
Drink? My pleasure!

948
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,239
If you're not his niece then
who invited you?

949
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,919
No one invited me, I just came.

950
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,799
I know the host.

951
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,039
- Papa?
- Papa?

952
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,239
I met your father...

953
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:23,559
- at a concert.
- Interesting.

954
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:25,359
But I'm leaving.

955
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,599
A gentleman said
he'd take me home.

956
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,319
- Your dance partner?
- Yes. Pretty, isn't he?

957
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,159
He's taking me home.

958
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,919
Really?
Listen here...

959
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:17,719
Very good!

960
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,199
Very good! Oh yes, very good!

961
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,199
I'm going to marry you.

962
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,599
I'm only going to marry you.
Ha-ha.

963
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,799
- Only me?
- Only you.

964
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:53,119
- Good! Let's drink to that.
- Drink, sweetheart, drink!

965
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,039
You can drink, can't you?
Stop!

966
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:18,239
- This way, this way.
- Thank you, so kind.

967
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,199
Sir, if you will excuse me,
the room appears to be taken!

968
01:09:23,360 --> 01:09:24,159
What?

969
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,239
- I saw Mr Makáts go in.
- And then?

970
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,079
I am afraid he is not alone.

971
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,359
I see. The young couple.

972
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,079
- Let's not disturb them.
- I think we should.

973
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,839
I'm going to marry you.

974
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:39,279
- Only me?
- I'm going to marry you.

975
01:09:39,440 --> 01:09:42,599
Oh, the young couple.
How sweet they are.

976
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,639
Mr Schneider,

977
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,639
let me introduce my fiancé.

978
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,439
- Your name?
- Mimi!

979
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,999
Erm, erm... erm...
What about the contract?

980
01:09:52,160 --> 01:09:55,559
- I'm not the least bit interested.
- The nerve!

981
01:09:55,720 --> 01:09:58,079
Please leave our respectable house!

982
01:09:58,240 --> 01:10:00,919
Respectable house?!
Your husband invites me here

983
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:04,479
and your daughter runs offwith a
chauffeur before the engagement.

984
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:10,039
Nice little house, I have to say!
Don't get agitated! Cheerio!

985
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,919
Cheerio, sweetheart, cheerio.

986
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,519
I want to get married!
I want to get married!

987
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,119
Get off me, you fool.
Off to bed with you!

988
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,359
Good night, everybody!

989
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,879
Is this the house famed
for its moral standards?

990
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,879
I find myself
faced with a new situation.

991
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,759
I am outraged!

992
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:34,839
Madam! Sir!
Good evening to you both!

993
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,679
Who's to blame?

994
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,639
- Me?
- Quiet!

995
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,439
Do I have to wear a suit
to eat bread?

996
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:51,719
Quiet!

997
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,799
And who was to blame for the diet?

998
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,239
Quiet!

999
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,119
- Who landed me with that dancer?
- Me, perhaps?

1000
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:59,839
We're not talking about that.

1001
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,959
Who is to blame for your daughter
running offwith a chauffeur?

1002
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:05,039
Hyppolit is to blame for everything.

1003
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:07,039
- But, Papa!
- But I'll show him.

1004
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:09,879
- I'll show him who I am!
- Papa!

1005
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:21,479
Hyppolit!

1006
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:30,399
- Where are the guests?
- They left.

1007
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,919
- Why?
- Why?

1008
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,239
Hyppolit!

1009
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:36,959
- Where is Hyppolit?
- I can't find him.

1010
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,879
- Bring him here and I'll kill him!
- Then I'll find him.

1011
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,639
I would like a private word
with you, Mr Schneider!

1012
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:07,559
Yes.

1013
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,639
After the scandalous events
of this evening with the dancer,

1014
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:15,279
I am forced

1015
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,639
to take the consequences and resign.

1016
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:22,479
We have arrived, Miss Mimi.

1017
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,119
Shocked, aren't you?

1018
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:29,479
Terribly!
In fact, I'm stunned.

1019
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:32,199
You wanted to take
your girlfriend home.

1020
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,119
That's true.

1021
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:36,919
But now I've ruined your plans.

1022
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:38,759
If you like.

1023
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,959
Take me home at once!

1024
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:46,999
Here. 34 Elizabeth Street.
The Schneider villa.

1025
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,719
Please get out.

1026
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,599
I'm leaving.

1027
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,559
- I'll take the cases.
- The cases stay!

1028
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:57,959
That's bad!

1029
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,439
You're leaving now?
No, no, no.

1030
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,639
You're staying and working
out your notice.

1031
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:08,559
And every day you will have to
watch me eat my supper not in a suit

1032
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,279
but in my shirt sleeves. Like this!

1033
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:15,959
And I'll eat onions with my goose.

1034
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,519
With everything.

1035
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,679
I'll eat onions with onions.

1036
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:23,559
And I'll eat fish with a knife.
Two knives.

1037
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:28,199
My wife will eat as much as
she likes. She'll be this fat.

1038
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:31,559
And I'll grow my moustache back.
It'll be this big.

1039
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,159
What's going on?

1040
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,479
My dear friend
and musical companion!

1041
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,879
At this festive hour,

1042
01:13:52,080 --> 01:13:55,039
surrounded by friends and family...

1043
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:57,239
Forget that rubbish!

1044
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:01,839
Dear friends. On the engagement
of your dear daughter...

1045
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,079
What engagement?

1046
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:06,639
We know. We know. Just start!

1047
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,839
Watch out! Watch out!

1048
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,039
One, two...
Three cheers forthe happy pair...

1049
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,399
Stop!

1050
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:17,799
You're mistaken.
There's to be no engagement!

1051
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,119
What's going on here?

1052
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:26,359
Don't joke, sir.
Here are the happy couple.

1053
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:30,359
You can leave
because there is no engagement.

1054
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,039
Or am I wrong?

1055
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:35,119
You're even interfering in this?!

1056
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:38,639
I don't care if you go pop,
this is the happy couple.

1057
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:44,239
You see! Ready!

1058
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,919
One, two...
Three cheers forthe happy pair,

1059
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:51,399
like turtle doves in the air...

1060
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,959
The End
