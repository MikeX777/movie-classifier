<i>Right, left.</i>

00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,076
<i>Right, left.</i>

3
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,079
<i>Right, left. Eight more.</i>

<i>Six, left.</i>

00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,046
<i>Right, left.</i>

8
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,882
<i>Four, left.</i>

9
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,385
<i>Three, left. Keep going.</i>

10
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,303
<i>Two, left.</i>

11
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,556
<i>And last time, left.</i>

12
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:23,392
<i>Now sit up just a little more.</i>

13
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,352
<i>Hands behind your head.</i>

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,522
<i>Exhale and bring the right elbow
to the left knee.</i>

15
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,774
<i>Inhale. Straighten.</i>

16
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,902
<i>Exhale. Left elbow to right knee.</i>

17
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,238
<i>Inhale. Straighten.</i>

18
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,198
<i>Right, up.</i>

19
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,576
<i>Left, up.</i>

20
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,911
<i>Right, up.</i>

21
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,872
Never in the history of the world

22
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,374
has there been a boy
as slow as you are.

23
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,877
Now, come on, Brad, move your dead ass.
Let's go.

24
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,378
I don't feel like it.

25
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,632
- Go ahead without me.
- I'm not going without you.

26
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,676
Come on, let's go. Get your bike.

27
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,431
Brad, you're gonna be a terrific rider.

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,684
You just gotta wake up.
Get your bike, and let's go.

29
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,686
I just don't feel like it.
Not today.

30
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,605
You always say
you just don't feel like it.

31
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,689
Then when you get out there,
you have a terrific time.

32
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,691
Come on.

33
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,447
- Not always.
- Brad.

34
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,699
<i>Left, up.</i>

35
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,660
<i>Right, up. Left, up.</i>

36
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,495
<i>Right, up. Left.</i>

37
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,604
Hi, Bob.

38
00:03:57,862 --> 00:03:59,071
All right now?

39
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,906
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,116
- I just gotta wake up.
- You just gotta wake up.

41
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,621
- Think you'll be able to keep up?
- I might.

42
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,206
Sure, you will.

43
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,750
You wait and see,

44
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,920
you'll turn around a couple years,
I won't even be able to keep up with you.

45
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,672
You'll be blowing right by me.

46
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,633
But I'll still be able
to beat your brother.

47
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,479
<i>Nine, 10, 11, 12.</i>

48
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,359
<i>Nineteen, 20.</i>

49
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,369
We're gonna be going up that hill.

50
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,038
- Right?
- Right.

51
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,416
Charging up that hill.

52
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,043
Let's do it!

53
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,337
Come on, you're doing great.

54
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,465
Come on.

55
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:02,342
You can do it!

56
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,053
You can do it!

57
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,473
Come on.

58
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,185
You can do it.

59
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,271
Come on.

60
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,275
Come on, pump!

61
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,029
You can do it.

62
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,534
Come on.

63
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,290
Morning, Henry.

64
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,138
I'm gonna get started.
I'll see you back there.

65
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,478
Hi, Mr. Abhart.

66
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,484
<i>Mary Liz.</i>

67
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,155
Mary Elizabeth.

68
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,116
Speak to me.

69
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,119
Mom, I'm not hungry,
and I don't have the time to eat.

70
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,498
Breakfast, now.

71
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,045
What goes on here?

72
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,296
I'm coming, Mom.

73
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,839
Yes, I can see that.

74
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,259
Here. Here. Here.

75
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,928
I hate them.

76
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,296
Those are your favorite pants.

77
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,265
That's your sweater that your
grandmother sent you from Chicago.

78
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,518
What is all this?

79
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:36,061
Some stuff.

80
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,854
Some dirty stuff.

81
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,107
Scottie.

82
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,984
- Don't open that!
- Why not?

83
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,362
There's treasure in there.

84
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,155
Excuse me.

85
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,200
Listen, young man.
I'm gonna count to five.

86
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,952
- You better get dressed.
- No.

87
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,662
One. Two.

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,541
Three. Four. Five.

89
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,459
There's rehearsal today.

90
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,505
- Hi, Tom.
- What do you say, Lar?

91
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,799
Love the robe, Cynthia.

92
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,979
- Good ride?
- Not so good.

93
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,398
- Make the hill?
- Dad did.

94
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,733
Mary Liz, come on.

95
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,956
Scottie, stop fooling around.

96
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,584
What time is it?

97
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,087
That can't be right. I'm late.

98
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,923
Why didn't anybody call me?
Where's Daddy?

99
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,759
- You must eat something. Come on.
- Give me a break, Mother.

100
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,096
Scottie!

101
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,120
- Eighteen minutes flat, Mike.
- Is that good?

102
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,289
That's fantastic.

103
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,000
It's 30 seconds better
than my best time.

104
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,418
What do you say, Hiroshi?

105
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:27,130
Hiroshi, Tom can't go fishing now.
He has to go to work.

106
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,548
Some other time, pal?

107
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,050
- Okay.
- How about Sunday?

108
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,218
Yeah.

109
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,802
Catch a fish as big as your old man.

110
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,471
- This big?
- Bigger.

111
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,639
- Bigger.
- Bigger.

112
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,932
- This big!
- That's a minnow.

113
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,558
Tom. Tom.

114
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,104
It's all right, Mike. I don't mind.
Hell, he gets along great with my kids.

115
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,440
- I'll see you Sunday, Hiroshi?
- Yeah.

116
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:48,151
All right. See you later.
Take care, Mike.

117
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,947
- See you tomorrow.
- See you this morning.

118
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,581
- Come on, kids, you're gonna be late.
- Okay.

119
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,960
- Bye.
- Bye-bye. Have a good day.

120
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,838
- Bye, Daddy.
- Hey, don't I get a kiss?

121
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,216
Yes.

122
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,428
I made it in 18 minutes.

123
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,055
- Really?
- Yeah.

124
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,889
- Bye.
- Hey, we'll do it again in the morning.

125
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,767
- You'll do better.
- Yeah.

126
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,353
Come on, let's get going.

127
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,272
I made it in 18 minutes.

128
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,025
- You smell.
- I smell? That stinks.

129
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,361
- Thanks for telling me.
- Eighteen minutes.

130
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,989
Well, that's great. How about...
Where did you go?

131
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,118
Shower, shave and clean up.
Remember, I smell.

132
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:40,620
- How about a little help?
- No.

133
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,039
No time.
I'll do it tonight, leave it.

134
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,708
They come this morning.

135
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,919
Come on, sweetie pie, let's go.

136
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,465
Where's the toilet paper?
I couldn't find any.

137
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,800
Have you seen my keys?

138
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:56,011
I can't see anything.
Have you seen my wallet?

139
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,512
Where's Scottie?
Scott!

140
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,973
- Where's my breakfast?
- Try your other pants.

141
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,641
Right over here, on the table.

142
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,810
Boo! I'm a rat from Europe.

143
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:07,063
- A what from where?
- You are not a rat, Scottie.

144
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,732
I wanna be a rat.

145
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,859
- Looks like a rat to me.
- No, he's a child.

146
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,907
I don't know about that,
except for this banana.

147
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,781
Well, in the school play.
A child, a very important part.

148
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,158
I'd rather be the rat.

149
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,406
- Does that mean I can be a rat?
- Thanks a lot, pal.

150
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,330
- It's only a school play.
- Yes, one I happen to be the director of.

151
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,577
- An act of suicide, if I ever saw.
- What's suicide?

152
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,708
Tom!

153
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,169
- I didn't say anything.
- You certainly did.

154
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,379
Stop, you're making my ears hurt.

155
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,506
I gotta go.

156
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,092
- What about breakfast?
- Don't waste it.

157
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,927
Give us a kiss, rat.

158
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,555
Mommy.

159
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:45,226
My God, look at the size of that dandruff.
Here's a kiss.

160
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,896
Bye, rat.

161
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,857
Bye, madam director.

162
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,450
My wallet.

163
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,935
Tom?

164
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,147
Did you hear that?
Was that Scottie?

165
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,984
Go to sleep.

166
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,741
We have to talk.

167
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,160
Some other time.

168
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,454
There is no other time.

169
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,832
Go to sleep.

170
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,127
I'm serious.

171
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,505
So am I. Turn off the light.

172
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:58,508
This is the only time we have time.

173
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,974
What are we gonna get Brad
for his birthday?

174
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,810
He wants that computer game.

175
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,813
Get him a good bike. Lygie.

176
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,649
A solid Peugeot.

177
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,985
Get him out of toys
and into the real world.

178
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,863
- That's what he needs.
- That's what you think he needs.

179
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,074
Why are we talking about this?

180
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,748
Brad's birthday is two months away.
Why are we talking?

181
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,376
Go to sleep. Turn out the light.

182
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,758
Ronnie Peebler didn't register
for the draft.

183
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,634
He's been indicted.

184
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:46,431
I don't know what's gonna happen.

185
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,017
- Brad will be 18 in...
- Carol.

186
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,268
What?

187
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,522
In five years and two months.

188
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,400
Then wake me. Now?

189
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,903
- Go to sleep?
- Yes.

190
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,253
Now what are you doing?

191
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,130
Looking for my journal.

192
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:24,052
- Carol, it's the middle of the night.
- So what?

193
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,771
There isn't anything in that journal.

194
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,439
Well, I'm gonna start right now.

195
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,289
I've heard that before.

196
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,960
Sometimes you're such a...

197
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,673
I've heard that before.

198
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,012
Okay.

199
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,516
Talk to me.

200
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,896
I've heard that before.
I've tried that before.

201
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,197
What are you doing?
Get out of there.

202
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,033
- Get out of there.
- Get out of where?

203
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,285
Cut it out.

204
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,704
Give you something to write
in your journal.

205
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,832
Okay, you asked for it.

206
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,379
This is from...

207
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,090
And this is from...

208
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,596
Who did you say that was from?

209
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,400
It's time, honey.

210
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,986
No, I don't wanna do that.

211
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,322
Fellas, what's happening?

212
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,324
You can have the straw, too.

213
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,784
Come on, gang, let's move it.

214
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:15,663
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, darling.

215
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,206
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye.

216
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,751
Bye, Mom.

217
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,214
Let me out of here!

218
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,216
Let me out of here.

219
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,731
And they'll pop out from behind.

220
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,149
Like, they'll all pop out.

221
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,402
Now, let's get down to work.

222
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,113
Rats, over there.

223
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,616
Children, over here.

224
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,203
The mayor. Where's the mayor?

225
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,163
- Right here.
- Here's the mayor.

226
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,793
And the Pied Piper also.

227
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:06,798
Lisa, come beside me.
And the little crippled boy.

228
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,259
Come on, Scottie, yes.

229
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,011
Now, you'll do fine.

230
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:13,638
Here, darling, I'll take it.

231
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,810
Now, piano, please.

232
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:29,862
Thank you.

233
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,409
Now, I want you all
to listen to Mrs. Wetherly.

234
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,869
All right. Let's begin.

235
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,540
All the rats go over here.
Crouch down low.

236
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,042
Crouch down low for the beginning.

237
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,754
Townspeople, just push back.
Give Lisa some space.

238
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,424
That's right.
Remember how we did it before? Good.

239
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,094
Okay, Lisa?
Lisa, come on, darling.

240
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,889
- Do you know your opening lines?
- Yeah.

241
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,808
Now, remember that
there's gonna be people

242
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,376
way in the back of that room,
and they need to hear you, too.

243
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,438
So you wanna speak up a little more.
All right?

244
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:07,942
Welcome. We wanted to do this play

245
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,362
because we live in Hamlin, California.

246
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,990
So did this story happen
a long time ago,

247
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:17,493
in a town called Hamelin. Thank you.

248
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,787
Wonderful. Okay, Lisa goes off.

249
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,332
Now, all of you run to your town places.
The rats go into the mountain.

250
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,549
<i>While fishing for dinner,
a boy caught a big letter A.</i>

251
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:36,304
<i>He then caught a B, a C, D and E.</i>

252
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,139
<i>And an F, G, H, I, J...</i>

253
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,427
<i>Hi, dear, won't be home until late.
Don't wait dinner.</i>

254
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,018
<i>In fact, forget dinner. Sorry.</i>

255
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,941
- How's it now?
- Funny.

256
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,403
That's a big help.
What's that supposed to mean?

257
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:54,781
Mary Liz, will you turn that down?

258
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,240
Wrinkles.

259
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,493
What? I can't hear you.

260
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,995
Mary lizard,
would you shut that thing off?

261
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:02,997
No.

262
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:06,292
<i>Hi, dear. How's everybody?</i>

263
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,213
<i>Dad and I thought we might drop in
on you guys around Easter.</i>

264
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,798
<i>It's snowing in Chicago.</i>

265
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,591
- Yes.
<i>- Call us collect.</i>

266
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,469
- Yes, what?
- No more wrinkles.

267
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,224
Stupid antenna.

268
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,726
When are we gonna get cable
like everybody else?

269
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,230
<i>It's me again, honey.
Scratch that last stuff.</i>

270
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,650
<i>Gonna get out of here by 3:30,
and with luck, I'll be home by 5:00.</i>

271
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,318
Your dad will be home for dinner.

272
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,072
<i>Carol, Cynthia.</i>

273
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,367
<i>This costume for the play
is driving me crazy. Call me.</i>

274
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,786
<i>What's a alphabet?</i>

275
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,704
<i>You don't know what the alphabet is?</i>

276
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:46,082
<i>Yeah. A, B, C, D, E, F, G.</i>

277
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,626
<i>- Do you know what it's for?
- Yes.</i>

278
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,880
Better try again.

279
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,007
That's not the antenna, Mom.

280
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,345
Hands off, banana man.

281
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,274
<i>This is San Francisco.</i>

282
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,526
<i>We have lost our New York signal.</i>

283
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:19,615
<i>Radar sources confirm the explosion
of nuclear devices there, in New York,</i>

284
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,617
<i>and up and down the east coast.</i>

285
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:27,039
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is real.
This is...</i>

286
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,836
<i>We interrupt this program
at the request of the White House.</i>

287
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,963
<i>This is a national emergency.</i>

288
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,632
<i>This is an emergency
action notification.</i>

289
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,760
<i>I repeat, we interrupt this program
at the request of the White House.</i>

290
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,054
<i>Do not use your telephone.</i>

291
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:45,141
<i>Telephone lines should be
kept open for official use.</i>

292
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,143
<i>Important instructions will follow.</i>

293
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,061
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

294
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,522
- Hello? Tom?
<i>- ...the President of the United States.</i>

295
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,816
Hello?

296
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,651
- Mom!
- Mom!

297
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,653
- Get away from that window!
- Mommy?

298
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,031
Get down on the floor. Get down.

299
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,159
- Was that Dad?
- Is he in San Francisco?

300
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,785
- I'm scared.
- I don't know.

301
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,954
Put your heads down, cover your eyes.

302
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,539
Oh, my God. My God.

303
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,716
Mommy!

304
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,177
Mama!

305
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,262
- Kenny!
- Mommy!

306
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,724
Kenny!

307
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,189
- Carol.
- There's Phil and Cathy.

308
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,191
- They're safe.
- What happened?

309
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,526
I don't know. No one does yet.

310
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,404
- We just got home.
- We just got back. We're so lucky.

311
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,990
Thank God we're all here.

312
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,702
Kenny!

313
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,120
Have you seen Kenny?

314
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,289
- No.
- Where's Tom?

315
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,125
He'll be here any minute.

316
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,587
I'm sure he will be.

317
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,464
Mommy!

318
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,552
<i>Tom, we're at Henry Abhart's.</i>

319
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,179
<i>We're all okay.</i>

320
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,765
<i>Come. We'll wait.</i>

321
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,561
CQ, CQ, CQ.

322
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:16,941
This is W6DN,
Whiskey, Six, Delta, November calling.

323
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,362
Three generators.
He built it specially.

324
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,991
It's still working.

325
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,327
No, there's no damage here,
except all transistors are knocked out.

326
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:32,081
- Who else have you talked to, Hal?
- Rosemary, dear. You both all right?

327
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,251
Yeah, I been trying to raise them myself
without success.

328
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,586
He's raised Yuba City and Eureka,

329
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:41,632
and we got a place somewhere
near Omaha, Nebraska.

330
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,677
Maybe there's an electromagnetic
radiation effect there.

331
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,263
Well, you keep trying, Hal.

332
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,727
Well, folks.

333
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,940
So far I can't raise Seattle, Portland,

334
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,151
Sacramento or Southern California.

335
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,236
San Francisco is silent,

336
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,864
the entire Bay area.

337
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,867
Visalia and a chunk of Montana,

338
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:11,620
West Texas, north of us,
now, they're okay.

339
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,748
What about Chicago?

340
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:19,879
So far, I can't raise anything
east of Keokuk, Iowa.

341
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,799
A fellow in Twain Harte
thinks they hit Yosemite.

342
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,302
The sky is black with splinters,

343
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,888
and trees and rocks
coming down like rain.

344
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,475
Must have been a mistake.
There's nothing strategic there.

345
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,395
We keep waiting for word
from Washington,

346
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,647
or where they've evacuated to.

347
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,566
And it'll come.

348
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,445
We may be crippled,
but we're not cut off

349
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,905
and we're not dead.

350
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,532
If you want news,

351
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,453
if you want food and water,
and whatever we got, we can spare.

352
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,540
Rosemary and I, we'll be here.

353
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,877
Day or night, we'll be here.

354
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,603
Tom?

355
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,942
Mama.

356
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,777
Where's Daddy?

357
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,781
He'll be here, honey,
as soon as he can.

358
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,117
But I want Daddy.

359
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,078
Mary Liz, it's all right.
Come on in.

360
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,296
Brad?

361
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,756
I'm okay, Mom.

362
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,385
What are you doing?

363
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,346
Keeping watch?

364
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,266
Dad would.

365
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,674
<i>February 24th.</i>

366
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,927
<i>I'm so afraid.</i>

367
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:34,430
<i>Nothing seems real.</i>

368
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,016
<i>Everything looks the same.</i>

369
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,186
<i>Maybe if I write, it will help.</i>

370
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,031
<i>I ache to talk to my mother.</i>

371
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,201
<i>If I could only hear her voice.</i>

372
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,661
I hate breakfast.

373
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,705
Since when?

374
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,248
I can't know.

375
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,419
My dish has dirt on it.

376
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,087
So does mine.

377
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,173
Let me see.

378
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,967
Well, we'll wipe them off.

379
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,177
There are others.

380
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,470
Thanks.

381
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,935
Thank you, darling.

382
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,854
The milk tastes funny.

383
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,440
It's warm.

384
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,692
When's our refrigerator gonna work?

385
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,945
Doesn't radiation get into cows?

386
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,822
We'll use powdered milk.

387
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,909
Your dad has all that stuff
from your camping trips.

388
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,119
That stuff tastes funny, too.

389
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,539
Doesn't radiation get into water?

390
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,709
Well, it can.
Maybe it won't be so bad here.

391
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,586
But we'd better be careful.

392
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,755
What's "radation"?

393
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:53,884
Here, have a banana.

394
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,387
You never gave me one before.

395
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,430
I did now.

396
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,683
There may not be any more for a while.

397
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,729
- May I have the butter, Mary Liz?
- Yeah.

398
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,189
Would you see who that is, dear?

399
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:11,860
When's the television gonna work?
What are we gonna do today?

400
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,113
- No more questions, okay?
- Hi, Larry.

401
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,241
- Here, darling.
- Okay.

402
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,161
Hello, Larry.

403
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,205
Can I stay here until
my mother and father

404
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,124
get back from San Francisco?

405
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,210
Were you alone all night?

406
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,463
Are they with Dad, Mommy?

407
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,008
Maybe.

408
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,178
Of course, you can.

409
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,974
- Like some bread?
- Yes.

410
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,351
- Mary Liz?
- Yes, please.

411
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,691
- Brad?
- Okay.

412
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,695
If you... If you could just quiet down.

413
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,115
Just, could...
Could you, please, just be quiet?

414
00:26:58,283 --> 00:26:59,658
Just one moment,

415
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,994
and then we will tell you
exactly what we know.

416
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,329
All right, now, listen!

417
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,706
- Which isn't very much.
- Please listen!

418
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,999
Quiet!

419
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,293
All of you, listen.

420
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,629
When are you gonna do something?

421
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,797
We just don't have all the answers.

422
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,549
That's all there is to it.

423
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,134
But we are trying to find out.

424
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,053
Tell us anything you know.

425
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,305
Henry Abhart is talking
with other communities,

426
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,931
some even in Canada.

427
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,433
There may be answers outside.

428
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,602
You can't depend on that old man.

429
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,313
Who else knows how to run that radio?

430
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,201
I mean, he's gonna have
to have some relief.

431
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,317
We're hoping to get
our communications network

432
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,485
restored shortly.

433
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:37,196
That should give us a fair picture
of what's happening out there.

434
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,284
I'm not worried about what's
happening out there.

435
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,408
I'm worried about right here, Darryl.

436
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:45,287
I got a plate-glass window broken, $500.

437
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:49,291
My pharmacy's looted, $2,000, $3,000.

438
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,876
- I want my goods back now.
- We all know that the supermarket

439
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,129
was broken into last night, Darryl.

440
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,923
There has been some looting,

441
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,426
but right now the markets are under
guard and it's quiet out there.

442
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:03,138
Look, if there's any further trouble,
we'll invoke martial law.

443
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,765
Someone comes by my place, Darryl,

444
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:07,267
they try to do something,
I am gonna protect myself.

445
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,644
I don't care who it is!

446
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,412
You don't take the law
in your own hands!

447
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,648
Hey, calm down.
Don't create panic here.

448
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,942
This isn't getting us anywhere.

449
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,861
The reason why we've come here
today is to work together,

450
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,738
to make this community work.

451
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,950
We...

452
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,121
We called off school today.

453
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:32,376
The teachers
and the administration, we thought,

454
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,002
"What's the point?"

455
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:36,672
Now, that was wrong.

456
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,467
I remember after the president
was assassinated,

457
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:44,096
we bowed our heads, we mourned.

458
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,891
We went on.

459
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,156
Look, maybe... Maybe we should start
a community force.

460
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:05,284
- What, like the Red Cross?
- Yes, like the Red Cross.

461
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,619
To help those people who need it.

462
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,246
I don't think it's reasonable

463
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,582
to expect we're gonna
get help from the outside.

464
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,792
- We have civil defense.
- What civil defense?

465
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,963
Are you people crazy? You're talking
like this is an earthquake or a hurricane.

466
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,758
Well, it's not!
Bernie, you're a doctor.

467
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,884
Why don't you tell these good
people what they've got...

468
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,178
Got to look forward to here.

469
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,809
We don't know yet.

470
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:34,271
Well, we really have
no equipment available

471
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,733
for accurately measuring
radiation fallout.

472
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,321
If the rads dosage reaches

473
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:48,202
40 or 50 per hour,
and remains there long,

474
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,953
there will be illness.

475
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:54,708
And that can lead to dizziness,

476
00:29:56,044 --> 00:30:00,756
gastroenteritis, fever, vomiting,

477
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,969
skin sores, hair loss.

478
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,189
Doctor?

479
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,235
- Doctor?
- Bernie.

480
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,155
My baby wouldn't take
my milk this morning.

481
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,490
She threw it up.

482
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,160
Maybe that's nothing,

483
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,204
maybe she'll be fine in the morning,

484
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,873
but how do I know?

485
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,503
Is there something I can do?

486
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,886
The best sources we have

487
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:51,014
recommend using only bottled water

488
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,725
and eating canned food.

489
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,936
You make me laugh.

490
00:30:56,145 --> 00:31:00,816
Bombs, hundreds of bombs,
are leveling cities.

491
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:05,112
It's throwing debris miles into the sky.

492
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,040
And you're telling me
it's gonna have trouble

493
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,658
finding its way into my canned apricots.

494
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,373
Hey!

495
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,375
You don't understand.

496
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,378
Hey, you! You!
I want you out of that line.

497
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,213
There are other people waiting for gas.

498
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,215
You got some nerve cutting in front.

499
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,017
No. No, no, no.

500
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,561
No! Come on! Out! Out!

501
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,354
Come on! Come on, move!

502
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,233
No, no, no. No credit card.
No. No, no.

503
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,277
I don't have time for you, come on.

504
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,371
Good morning, missus.
Your husband get home last night?

505
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,707
He was on his way.

506
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,544
We thought we'd come by,
in case we hear from him.

507
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,673
- What are you charging?
- It's free to my regular customers.

508
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,676
Hiroshi!

509
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:15,057
I thought last night,
Hiroshi and I, we don't need much.

510
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,643
Food and roof.

511
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,020
Store some canned goods.

512
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:23,649
When the gas is gone,
we'll plant a garden.

513
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,776
Go fishing. Hey, Hiroshi.

514
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,277
- What?
- You wanna go fishing?

515
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,904
Go fishing? Yeah.

516
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,822
Can I go fishing, too?

517
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,575
How come the gun, Mike?

518
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,829
Just because I'm giving away gas,
I'm no fool.

519
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,581
You, too.

520
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,500
Ones that never been here,

521
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,878
ones that never had time for us,
for Hiroshi.

522
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,254
Hiroshi.

523
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,508
Well, I'll accept the gas, Mike,

524
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,802
but only if you and Hiroshi
come over for a meal.

525
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,095
I wanna repay you somehow.

526
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,767
The gas has been paid for,
missus, many times.

527
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,062
I just hope you get to have a use for it.

528
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:04,940
Hiroshi.

529
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,673
<i>February 25th.</i>

530
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,426
<i>I stopped sleeping.</i>

531
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,594
<i>Afraid to close my eyes.</i>

532
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:38,640
<i>I find myself staring at the children.</i>

533
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:46,440
<i>How did this happen?</i>

534
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,635
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

535
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,637
There's no saving places in line.

536
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,639
He's my son.

537
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,487
I don't care, I've been waiting for hours.

538
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,269
Well, so has he. More than four hours.

539
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,437
This is our place.

540
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,731
You got a lot of nerve.

541
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,036
Hi, Brad.

542
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,496
Hi.

543
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:07,479
<i>H-E-A-V-E-N.</i>

544
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,647
<i>You win.</i>

545
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,566
I saw that, Billdocker.

546
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:12,943
So what, Wetherly?

547
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,820
- Put them back.
- So what?

548
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,321
A couple of batteries.

549
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,450
What's your situation there?

550
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,704
- Hello, Brad.
- Hi, Mrs. Abhart.

551
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,039
- How's your family?
- Okay.

552
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,921
Well, I heard that, too.
You know what happened?

553
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:18,466
Nova Scotia heard the Russians
pulled a preemptive strike.

554
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:20,552
West Texas heard it was the Chinese.

555
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,806
South America heard it was
some radical liberation organization.

556
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,394
Glad to hear from you,
November, Six, Hotel, Lima.

557
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,896
Catch you soon again, Harvey.

558
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,317
Hi, laddie.

559
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,903
That was Santa Rosa,
they got it worse than we do.

560
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,113
Some actual blast damage.

561
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,157
Lot of concern about contamination.

562
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,366
Good spirit, though.

563
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,744
- Can I stay, Mr. Abhart?
- I'll tell you what.

564
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:51,249
You can run these down
to Dr. Jenson and that lady mayor.

565
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,919
They want these rad numbers.

566
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,630
Why? What they're gonna do with them,
I don't know.

567
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,506
- Have you got your bike?
- Yeah.

568
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,758
You rode up the hill?

569
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,470
I knew you would.

570
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:12,354
I keep hoping to reach
Mischa Usoff in the USSR.

571
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,189
Can I come back, Mr. Abhart?

572
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:18,193
I'll tell you what. You do that.

573
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,788
<i>Eleven days.</i>

574
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,750
<i>I wear your sweater.</i>

575
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,212
<i>It smells like you, my love.</i>

576
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,979
I thought we'd go on a picnic today.

577
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:55,814
Up by the trees.

578
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,316
See the one we planted
when you were born.

579
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,736
Mary Liz's, Scottie's.

580
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,949
Some people are leaving.

581
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,202
The Peeblers, the Hoffers, Dr. Jenson.

582
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,246
Think we should leave?

583
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:14,749
Talking about northern Canada.

584
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,084
Survival camps.

585
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,253
How are they gonna get there?

586
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,255
I don't know.

587
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,426
What do you think we should do?

588
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,265
Mr. Abhart, he lets me watch.

589
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:33,935
I run errands. I ride my bike.

590
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,064
Mary Liz has her piano lessons,

591
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,400
and Dad could still come.

592
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,569
Yes.

593
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,490
And this is our home.

594
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,793
Go on, you two run on ahead.

595
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,068
<i>Scottie's tree.</i>

596
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,073
<i>I can't write today.</i>

597
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,205
Dance, pipe and skip.

598
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:39,334
Dance fast into the mountains. Dance.

599
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,756
They're gone.

600
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:48,676
He's done it, by gadfry!
Come out, citizens.

601
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,136
Come out.

602
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,100
I'll accept thou promised
payment of 1,000 guilders,

603
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,812
for I have saved your town
from the plague of rats.

604
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,980
You play wonderful music.

605
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,359
But what rats? I see no rats.

606
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,905
I will pay you 1 guilder
out of the kindness of my heart.

607
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:13,118
Thou made a promise.
Thou now is forgetting.

608
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:17,455
You're not going to be
difficult, now, are you, piper?

609
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,124
Thou is gonna be sorry.

610
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,376
Next time I'll play a different tune.

611
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,379
Play away, I love music.

612
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:36,224
Lisa, who was supposed
to be our narrator, is sick.

613
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,059
Nancy is going to take her place.

614
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,939
From schoolrooms and playgrounds,

615
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,984
from kitchens and nurseries,

616
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,402
the children came.

617
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,822
And their parents could not stop them.

618
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,740
The music of the piper led them.

619
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:56,202
Wait! I want to see islands!

620
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:00,457
I want to be strong
and tall and powerful.

621
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,625
I want ice cream.

622
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,878
Piper! Piper! Piper!

623
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,060
Oh, my son. He's gone. He's dead.

624
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,979
What have we done?

625
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,612
Your children are not dead.

626
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,155
They will return.

627
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:35,867
They are just waiting
until the world deserves them.

628
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,515
Hi, Phil.

629
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,101
Phil?

630
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,604
Phil.

631
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,902
They said we should conserve wood.

632
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,824
We had a tiny box,
but it wasn't big enough.

633
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,829
We didn't have a bureau the right size,
so Henry gave this to me.

634
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:04,998
See?

635
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,459
It's got tongue and groove.

636
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,129
It's a real antique.

637
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,091
And she'll fit in.

638
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:17,051
She'll fit in here.

639
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,227
We thought we were so lucky.

640
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,523
It didn't seem like
there'd be any more bombs.

641
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:35,903
Then Suzie had to get sick.

642
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,992
Of course, I tried to tell Cathy
that we're young.

643
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,578
We could have another baby.

644
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,708
You were so helpful to Cathy, nursing.

645
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,464
Cathy was so proud
she had plenty of milk.

646
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,719
We gave her water, but we boiled it.

647
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,891
Tell Cathy...

648
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,728
Tell Cathy we love her.

649
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,825
<i>March 8th.</i>

650
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:26,412
<i>I write this to try and keep my sanity.</i>

651
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:28,581
<i>What's left.</i>

652
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,168
<i>What if the baby is the lucky one?</i>

653
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,630
I want it back.

654
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,550
- Give it to me.
- Mary Liz!

655
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,278
He can't have it and you can't have it!

656
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,221
- You can't do it!
- I'll do what I want!

657
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,306
- Not that!
- She's hungry.

658
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:46,599
I'm hungry, you're hungry,

659
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,393
- Scott's hungry!
- I don't care!

660
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,187
- We're feeding him, aren't we?
- I won't have fighting!

661
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,023
She was feeding a cat. A stray cat.

662
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,441
- Mary Liz.
- I don't care.

663
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,026
I've always wanted a cat.

664
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,736
We have to ration food.

665
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,363
I don't care!

666
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,991
And Larry is a part of our family now.

667
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,661
What's the matter anyway?
Why are we bothering?

668
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,205
Mary Liz, I won't have you talk like that.

669
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,375
I knew it. I knew you'd side with Brad.

670
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,878
You always side with Brad.
He's not so great.

671
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,773
- Mary Liz.
- Don't come in.

672
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,778
Don't come in.

673
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,991
Don't come near me.

674
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,329
Don't.

675
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,124
- Sweetie.
- I just wanna die.

676
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,088
Don't.

677
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,556
Don't you do it.

678
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,478
I want my daddy.

679
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,066
Don't!

680
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,611
I miss him, too.

681
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,617
Mommy.

682
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,751
Have you seen Scottie?

683
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,044
No.

684
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:29,178
Carol.

685
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,097
I think you'd better come with me.

686
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,849
What's the matter?

687
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,529
He said he was running away.

688
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,115
I tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't let me.

689
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,919
Hey, there, little man.

690
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,256
Where did you come from?

691
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,758
I don't know.

692
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,596
What are you doing?

693
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,225
- My treasure.
- Your bottom drawer?

694
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:18,853
There's not enough food
for them anymore.

695
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,065
I'm running away. I hate fighting.

696
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:26,360
You've been known to get
in a few yourself, stubborn man.

697
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,945
No more.

698
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,239
Where will you go?

699
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,412
Maybe I'll find Dad.

700
00:48:39,958 --> 00:48:43,544
If you did, what would you do?

701
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:45,963
I can't know.

702
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,633
You tell me.

703
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,304
Well, you could see
the mountains and rivers.

704
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:56,098
You could see the cities.

705
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,060
You could come back here.

706
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,812
Would I be scared there, too?

707
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,443
We're all scared a little now and then.

708
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,196
I don't like it.

709
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:12,198
I don't either.

710
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,242
- At all.
- I know.

711
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:17,745
Tell it to go away.

712
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,372
I can't.

713
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,856
Where are you going?

714
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,193
We can't stay here anymore.

715
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:52,863
We'll write to you.

716
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,740
There's nothing left for us here.

717
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:55,950
Ever since the baby...

718
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:58,703
- Our parents, we...
- We have to get away.

719
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,997
We'll find a safe place.

720
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,999
We won't stop until we do.

721
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,503
We'll come back,
just as soon as we can.

722
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,298
Good luck.

723
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:12,466
Bye, Carol.

724
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,302
Bye, Carol.

725
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:40,786
CQ, CQ, CQ.

726
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,831
This is Whiskey, Six, Delta,
November calling.

727
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:46,792
Henry Abhart here in Hamlin, California.

728
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:50,004
This is Hamlin calling
and carefully tuning.

729
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:53,090
Can you hear me? Looking for calls.

730
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,593
CQ, CQ, CQ.

731
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,806
Brad.

732
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,767
Yes, sir?

733
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,313
I told the police chief
you were talking to Greenland.

734
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,648
He says his radio will be
working again soon.

735
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,527
He always says that.

736
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,530
Do you want me to deliver
any other messages?

737
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,032
Well,

738
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,036
Rosemary's been walking
the neighborhood, doing things.

739
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,997
Going from house to house,
checking on people,

740
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,916
seeing if there's anything to do.

741
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,127
Right now she's not feeling
as good as she should.

742
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:34,840
And maybe for the next couple
of days, what you could do

743
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:38,803
would be to take your bike
and stand in for her.

744
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,472
I'll do it.

745
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,058
Brad.

746
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,393
Yes, sir.

747
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,270
There's one other thing.

748
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,190
I can't raise Santa Rosa.

749
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:07,832
<i>March 23rd.</i>

750
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:11,752
<i>Mary Liz is practicing a new piece.</i>

751
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:15,631
<i>Larry has stopped talking, and Brad...</i>

752
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,342
<i>Brad never rests.</i>

753
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,888
<i>At least 1,300 have died.</i>

754
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,189
The hospital is still open
for emergency services.

755
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:35,401
There's a minimal staff on duty
24 hours.

756
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,988
I noticed we lost our garbage
pickup this week.

757
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,740
Well, there won't be any more.
It can't be managed.

758
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,995
And one more thing.

759
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,872
Please.

760
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,290
Any burials.

761
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,252
I want you to do them carefully.

762
00:52:57,132 --> 00:52:58,966
Darryl, how about the police?

763
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:08,392
My men are on duty
and they'll remain there.

764
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,064
The manpower has been depleted.

765
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:18,777
The communications system
will be repaired.

766
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,951
Order will be maintained.

767
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:29,788
Darryl.

768
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:31,290
Please sit down.

769
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,960
Sit down. It's all right.

770
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,172
It's all right.

771
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,582
Remember that skunk in Yosemite?

772
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,084
Yes.

773
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,589
Grandma's house?

774
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,259
Yes.

775
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,468
The smell.

776
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,556
Remember the bathtub
with clawed feet?

777
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,481
The morning I walked in
on you and Dad?

778
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:41,986
Yes.

779
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:46,532
What's it like?

780
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,784
What's what like?

781
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,328
Making love.

782
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,373
Don't play mother with me.

783
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,710
That's what I am.

784
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,381
What's it like?

785
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:08,554
I was so ignorant as a girl.

786
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:12,641
Worried about it. So full of fantasy.

787
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:18,939
I thought some man would come along
and sweep me off my feet.

788
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,192
And your father,

789
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:26,405
he wasn't at all what I was looking for.

790
00:55:28,074 --> 00:55:30,326
Not the size or shape,

791
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:33,162
or what he did exactly,
I still don't know.

792
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:39,168
When you love someone,

793
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:43,047
you wanna be as close to them
as you can get.

794
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,093
You make love,

795
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,055
and you feel almost like the same body.

796
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,892
Like it was intended.

797
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,313
You have a space,
and that person fills it up.

798
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,234
We would fight.

799
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:06,195
We wouldn't listen to each other.

800
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:11,325
We'd miss thoughts.

801
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:18,290
We'd miss goodbyes.

802
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:21,502
But sometimes,

803
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,255
most times,

804
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,591
there was this feeling,

805
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,345
and I couldn't wait for him
to be here with me.

806
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,727
Everyone's always alone.

807
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:43,107
And yet there can be this gift.

808
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,860
This making of miracles.

809
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,613
You.

810
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:52,658
Not for me.

811
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,283
You're going in the water.

812
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,412
There we go.

813
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,205
That's a boy.

814
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:42,541
Okay.

815
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,545
Shit.

816
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:56,180
Just rest your head against
here, all right, darling?

817
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,514
That's a boy.

818
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,945
You all right, darling?

819
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,990
Sweetie?

820
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:29,963
There.

821
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,438
Larry, thank you.
There. There's your bear.

822
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,360
Okay.

823
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,781
All right, darling.

824
00:58:57,325 --> 00:59:00,285
Okay. That's my boy.

825
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:04,414
That's my big boy.

826
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:44,658
I still can't find it.

827
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,536
- Mom!
- I can't find it! I want that bear!

828
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,871
It's time, Mom.
Don't you think we should get it done?

829
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,039
No.

830
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:55,335
- I'm sorry I'm late. Let's begin.
- Not yet.

831
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:01,049
- God said...
- Forget God. No one is touching him.

832
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,760
No one is burying him
until I find his bear!

833
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,929
Do you hear me? You understand?

834
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,823
"Whosoever believeth in me

835
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:28,034
"shall never die."

836
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,971
<i>It's me again. Can you believe it?</i>

837
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:31,640
<i>Double scratch.</i>

838
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,100
<i>I'm gonna have to stay
in San Francisco after all.</i>

839
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,769
<i>All these false alarms.</i>

840
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,646
<i>I'll make it up to you, I promise.</i>

841
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:40,398
<i>Give the kids a kiss, and love to you.</i>

842
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:46,965
Well, what is it, young man?

843
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:49,259
Are you all right?

844
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:53,430
I'm perfectly well, thank you.

845
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,933
Just resting.

846
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:01,521
Next time, knock. Thank you.

847
01:05:02,189 --> 01:05:03,315
I did.

848
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,152
Where's Mary Elizabeth?

849
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,863
She's late for her lesson.

850
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,455
My grandchildren were the same way.

851
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:24,711
They loved to watch me.

852
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,719
- Here.
- No, thank you, I can do it myself.

853
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:46,483
Why were you late?

854
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:48,318
I wasn't.

855
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:52,155
Don't be again. Shall we begin?

856
01:05:52,323 --> 01:05:54,741
- You have been practicing?
- Yes.

857
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,620
Good. Now, let me show you

858
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:02,082
the width of the fingers

859
01:06:03,876 --> 01:06:06,461
and the strength of the chord

860
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,423
I want in that left hand.

861
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:37,951
<i>Sunday, I think.</i>

862
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,662
<i>Watching Brad,</i>

863
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,498
<i>the man he's become.</i>

864
01:06:45,459 --> 01:06:47,210
<i>The man he'll not live to be.</i>

865
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:56,928
<i>Larry left us today.</i>

866
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:00,724
<i>He just crawled into a ball and died.</i>

867
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:03,727
<i>His mother was my friend.</i>

868
01:07:20,953 --> 01:07:22,370
Hey, what are you doing?

869
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,748
That's our food, Billdocker!

870
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,502
Let go!

871
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:34,257
No! No, no!

872
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,889
Not my bike!

873
01:07:41,766 --> 01:07:42,849
No!

874
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,186
Damn.

875
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,614
Come on.

876
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:37,297
<i>Never in the history of the world</i>

877
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:39,632
<i>has there been a boy
as slow as you are.</i>

878
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:42,594
<i>Now, come on, Brad,
move your dead ass. Let's go.</i>

879
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,162
What are you doing in my chair?

880
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,374
- Henry!
- It's "Henry" now, is it?

881
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:55,917
Mr. Abhart.

882
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:04,300
What you do is call me what you want.

883
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,471
What you do is get me a new voice.

884
01:11:10,182 --> 01:11:11,641
How is it out there?

885
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:18,106
That's what I thought.
Same as in here, you know.

886
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,901
I keep losing things,
and I can't find them.

887
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:25,238
They go away and they don't come back.

888
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,199
So...

889
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:31,536
Come here.

890
01:11:34,373 --> 01:11:37,792
Well, I'm not giving up
on this old world yet.

891
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:41,004
So Rosemary's gone,

892
01:11:42,506 --> 01:11:44,132
but I'll be here.

893
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:54,142
CQ, CQ.

894
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:56,602
CQ.

895
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:58,813
<i>CQ.</i>

896
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:01,482
<i>CQ.</i>

897
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,908
<i>I don't know what day it is.</i>

898
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,453
<i>I've lost track.</i>

899
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:17,457
<i>Henry thinks some miracle
may save us yet.</i>

900
01:12:19,960 --> 01:12:21,294
<i>He's foolish.</i>

901
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,091
<i>The cemetery is full.</i>

902
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:31,012
<i>They're burning the bodies.</i>

903
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:38,496
<i>My first-born.</i>

904
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:41,207
<i>My daughter.</i>

905
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:03,896
Is that Mike?

906
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,407
Hiroshi?

907
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:18,161
Hiroshi!

908
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:23,708
Hiroshi?

909
01:14:24,668 --> 01:14:26,127
Hi, Brad.

910
01:14:29,506 --> 01:14:30,631
Hiroshi.

911
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:33,176
- How are you, Brad?
- Pretty good.

912
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:34,802
What are you doing, Brad?

913
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,679
I came to take you to my house.

914
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,181
- I go to your house?
- Yeah.

915
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:40,099
- Okay.
- We're gonna go for a ride.

916
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,934
Let's go on a ride.

917
01:14:42,102 --> 01:14:43,644
Wanna get the stuff in the bike?

918
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:46,606
- Nope...
- Yeah. Let's go.

919
01:14:46,773 --> 01:14:47,899
Okay.

920
01:14:56,116 --> 01:14:58,784
So, done much fishing?

921
01:15:00,454 --> 01:15:02,955
All right. Put this right in here.

922
01:15:04,124 --> 01:15:05,791
Hey, your fishing pole.

923
01:15:05,959 --> 01:15:07,210
My fishing pole? Okay.

924
01:15:07,377 --> 01:15:08,794
Wanna go fishing?

925
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:11,214
- Go fishing? Yeah.
- Okay.

926
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,633
- Fishing?
- Fishing.

927
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:18,387
I'm taking you home

928
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:21,349
because I don't think your dad's
gonna be coming back.

929
01:15:21,725 --> 01:15:23,100
Oh, my God.

930
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:27,188
- This is pretty good.
- Good.

931
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,149
You pedaling? All right!

932
01:15:30,317 --> 01:15:32,360
Here we go. This is good.

933
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,489
We got your fishing pole,
we'll go fishing.

934
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,574
We'll have a party with all this food.

935
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,452
Here we go.

936
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:45,414
You're doing the job. All right!

937
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:27,350
CQ, CQ, CQ.

938
01:17:30,145 --> 01:17:31,812
Delta, Six.

939
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:36,108
This is Whiskey, Delta,
November calling.

940
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:39,320
Henry Abhart for Hamlin, California.

941
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:44,367
This is Brad, Brad Wetherly
for Henry Abhart, Hamlin.

942
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:49,372
This is Hamlin looking for a call.

943
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:52,458
Looking for a call.

944
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,544
Hamlin, looking for a call.

945
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,625
Henry's dead.

946
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:08,552
Who did this? God damn you.

947
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:54,134
I'm ready.

948
01:22:57,722 --> 01:22:59,682
Battery still works.

949
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:23,914
Brad.

950
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,250
I know, Mom.

951
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:30,921
Brad, I...

952
01:23:31,589 --> 01:23:33,048
I can't do it.

953
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:03,829
We forgot presents.

954
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,132
Where did you find it?

955
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:26,435
What do we do now?

956
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:29,521
Make a wish.

957
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:31,648
What do we wish for, Mom?

958
01:24:34,527 --> 01:24:36,862
That we remember it all.

959
01:24:39,282 --> 01:24:41,408
The good and the awful.

960
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,497
The way we finally lived.

961
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:51,335
That we never gave up.

962
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:59,426
That we will last, to be here.

963
01:25:03,389 --> 01:25:05,182
To deserve the children.
