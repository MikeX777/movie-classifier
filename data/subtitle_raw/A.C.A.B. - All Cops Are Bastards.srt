1
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:58,006
Riot police, sons-of-bitches...

2
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,047
Riot police, sons-of-bitches!

3
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,849
You sleeping here or coming home?

4
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,799
- Whatcha got?
- Good shit.

5
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,087
- One gram, 10 euros.
- One.

6
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,370
Wait for me here.

7
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,761
Didn't you see me?

8
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,560
Hey, fuckin' Fascist,
can't fight alone?

9
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,530
Get in the car.

10
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,970
Get in the car!

11
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,279
You guys feeling tough?

12
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,807
Bring it on!

13
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,330
Listen, I'll tell you just once.

14
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,361
Never come here again pushing
this shit around families and kids.

15
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,441
- Carolina!
- Daddy!

16
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,122
Don't move.

17
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,766
What is it?

18
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,927
What the fuck are you sayin'?
Shut up.

19
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,043
How much did you fuckin' drink?

20
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,484
Let us through, it's our right.

21
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,644
It's our right to go to Rome!

22
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,489
Get back!

23
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,328
Close ranks!
You have to stay back.

24
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,051
Hey, cut the spittin'!

25
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,765
You piece of shit!

26
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,322
Open!

27
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,007
That's Carletto's seat.

28
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,080
And that's his twin's.

29
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,201
When Carletto gets here,
I'll get up.

30
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,759
Nice goin', rookie!
First day on the job,

31
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:09,448
- you cracked two workers' heads,
how do you feel? - Great.

32
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,239
- Hey, bro'.
- Hey, guys.

33
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,766
- Wanna hit?
- No, thanks.

34
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,209
What's up with him?

35
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,370
Hi, Mom.

36
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,679
Couldn't you get assigned
to another unit?

37
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,365
It pays best.

38
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,639
What the fuck's this?
What do they want?

39
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,119
To put us out on the street
like they promised.

40
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,728
But they forgot the other promise:
To give you your own place.

41
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,839
..At the port, heading for Rome,
they were stopped by the police.

42
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,399
The demonstrators
are asking for urgent measures...

43
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,803
- Your Unit is getting more popular
everyday. - Get off it, Maria.

44
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,130
Where's he going?

45
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:56,002
We said no going out for a month.

46
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,159
You try telling him.

47
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,799
He ended up at headquarters for
brawling, he can't do what he wants.

48
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,565
He doesn't listen to me.

49
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,919
Look, be around the house more,

50
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,082
maybe you can get it in his head.

51
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,688
Okay.
I'll go shower.

52
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,799
Stop, you'll wake the building.

53
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,559
- What's this mean?
- Didn't you get the letter?

54
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,479
- I want a separation.
- Miriam,

55
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,159
this is my house, hear me?
And Carolina's my daughter!

56
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,759
- If you love her, be more careful.
- What do you mean?

57
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,359
- That supermarket thing.
- That again?

58
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,279
Which adds to the crap
you've always given her and me.

59
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:03,279
Don't make me repeat it,
open this fucking door, let me in.

60
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,760
Open this door!

61
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,279
- Carolina!
- Say hi to Daddy.

62
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,409
- Daddy's little girl, hi.
- He's sleeping elsewhere...

63
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:10,010
I was in the south curve,
but I had better tickets.

64
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,999
At a certain point, I see an opening
between the barriers and I say:

65
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,319
"I'll go through there", but
as soon as I do a riot cop comes,

66
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,719
he grabs me, says I can't be there.

67
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,725
- He grabs you?
- Yes. He yanks my arm hard,

68
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,921
- almost broke it.
- And what did you do?

69
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,759
I try to explain I have a ticket

70
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,199
and that he's hurting me,

71
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,319
but he doesn't even let me finish,

72
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,439
first he yells to shut up,

73
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,807
then he hits me in the mouth
with his helmet,

74
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,407
and this is the result.

75
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,968
- Is the officer who hit you here?
- Yeah.

76
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,210
Could you point him out?

77
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,208
He's sitting there.

78
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,159
I remind the court the defendant
is not new to this,

79
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,359
he has more than five suits pending
for aggravated assault.

80
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,206
Maybe it's about time
you dampened your exuberance.

81
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,519
Mazinga, you not only suck,
you're deaf too!

82
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,839
- Didn't you hear me?
- Only one guy deaf here.

83
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,119
I might be deaf, but I see good.

84
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,999
- Then see about fuckin' off.
- Yes sir, Chief, sir!

85
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
You look like my Grampa
with that body! Look here.

86
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,159
- Know what makes us different?
- 300 grams of brain, Carletto.

87
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,959
Zone diet, a balance of carbs,
fats and protein,

88
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,566
40-30-30.

89
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,439
You trim down like a sonofabitch
and fat disappears.

90
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,759
That's where
your grams of brain went!

91
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,399
Laugh, Nero, but I'm in the Zone.

92
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,644
Good, then take my advice:
Stay there.

93
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,966
What's wrong,
you worried about the hearing?

94
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,370
I'm pissed off.

95
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,959
Me and Nero
are witnesses, you know.

96
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,559
Three cops against a poor
sports fan. Not enough of us.

97
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,767
Not many but the right ones.

98
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,484
What's going on, huh?
I have two kids!

99
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,602
Is this any way
to put people out on the street?

100
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,762
Hey, no answer? I'm not invisible!

101
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:40,001
- You have to leave here.
- I'm not budging.

102
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,246
See to this, I'm going upstairs.

103
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,249
You heard him? You have to leave.

104
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,959
- It's useless telling me.
- Sir, please!

105
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,885
You can plead to the Virgin Mary,
I'm staying in my home.

106
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,919
- It's not your home.
- Yes, it is,

107
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,759
all my things are here,
so it's mine.

108
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,731
- Get up!
- Let go of him!

109
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,364
Right now.

110
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,446
That stuff's mine.

111
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,607
What are you doing?
It's my stuff!

112
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,241
Since it's down on the ground now,
your home is down there.

113
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,370
Rookie!

114
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,602
I mean you, what's your name?

115
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,879
- You must have a name.
- Costantini Adriano.

116
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,199
You won't get the job done
by attacking people.

117
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,359
Does kicking people out
seem like a job?

118
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,479
City Hall is kicking them out,

119
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,563
it's our job to limit damages,
you almost did some!

120
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,759
If you attack one, a revolt
breaks out and 100 get hurt.

121
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,719
Destroy him psychologically,
that way you resolve the problem

122
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,479
and no one gets hurt. Just use this,
with this, you'll get results.

123
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,927
Nice words. Can I go?

124
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,323
- Am I dismissed, Sir?
- Go, go.

125
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,847
He doesn't want to learn,
let it go.

126
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,242
Can't.

127
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,640
- Your mother's house?
- It's still occupied.

128
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,243
You got a job?
You're not around any more.

129
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,241
Adriano Costantini, Mr. tough guy?

130
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,919
- Adriano Costantini, that's all.
- I say Mr. tough guy.

131
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,319
- And if I don't like it?
- Your problem.

132
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,211
- Who the fuck's this?
- Relax, Gabriele, it's okay.

133
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,082
- Sure?
- Sure.

134
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,886
- See you around.
- Bye.

135
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,608
Why are you here?

136
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,479
- What do you want?
- I'm here to do you a favor.

137
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:04,247
- Meaning? - You work on a team,
you have to fraternize.

138
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,399
- Fraternize.
- With the older ones.

139
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,803
Don't worry, you'll be back
before midnight... Cinderella.

140
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,405
This is Carletto.

141
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,847
Anything you wanna say to him?

142
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,162
You know where we're going?

143
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,851
Me and him
have nothing more to say.

144
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,929
- Open up.
- I thought I'd forgotten something.

145
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,926
- That'll teach you to be
a tough guy. - You bastards!

146
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,768
Open up!

147
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,999
- Have a beer.
- That gives you a pot belly.

148
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,079
- Drink it.
- You nuts?

149
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,163
Then I have to eat half a kilo
of broccoli and string beans.

150
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,639
I told you, 40-30-30.

151
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,120
- I hear you, drink the beer.
- No, you don't understand.

152
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,045
- I'm good like this.
- I see that. Yeah, really.

153
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,201
Why the silence?

154
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,723
Adriano-Costantini-that's-all,
do you hear me?

155
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,439
- Open it.
- Wait a minute.

156
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,126
- What if he's suffocating?
- He's acting.

157
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,447
Relax.

158
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,959
You call this fraternizing?

159
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,759
- We wanted to see how you think.
- Another sermon?

160
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,919
You're no street kid now,
you're a riot cop,

161
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,799
- you wear a uniform. - A riot cop
always obeys his commander.

162
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,279
They said that times
at the Academy.

163
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:58,399
You don't fucking get it,
he's not your commander,

164
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,279
he's your brother,
he teaches you to live.

165
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,759
You're wrong, I'm an only child.

166
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,331
Cut the crap, kid.

167
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,479
A riot cop's worthless alone.
He makes sense only in a team.

168
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,847
You're part of a team,
or you're nothing.

169
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,649
Now you're part of the team.

170
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,319
Good, I want you pissed off

171
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,325
for the stadium on Sunday.

172
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,646
We're counting on you.

173
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,609
Now who'll fuckin' drive?
Not me.

174
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,122
Riot police, sons-of-bitches...

175
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,643
Don't look down,
stare at them in their eyes.

176
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,089
It's nothing serious.

177
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,322
Hear me? It's nothing serious.

178
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,609
Get your hands off me!

179
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,368
On your feet.

180
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,959
Open your jacket.

181
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,610
Nothing.

182
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,450
Come on!

183
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,769
Your jacket.

184
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,490
Sit down.

185
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,770
- You, stand up.
- No.

186
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:12,087
You have a badge
and I have a ticket.

187
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,601
- Stand up.
- I said no.

188
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,810
Put the club down,
leave him alone!

189
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,881
You shit, you're hurting him!

190
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,799
What the fuck are you doing?

191
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,079
- He wanted to take my club.
- Piece of shit!

192
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,402
Shut up or it's my turn.
Wait outside.

193
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Shut up. Open your jacket,
take the scarf off and shut up.

194
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,719
Let me see you, do I know you?
Got a record?

195
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,485
- No record.
- Hand over your I.D.

196
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,759
Listen to me.

197
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:13,159
That guy took your club
and bashed you in the face.

198
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,243
In getting it back,
you exchanged a blow or two.

199
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,119
Nero and me will say
we couldn't get there in time,

200
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,479
end of story.

201
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,051
I have to say some bullshit?

202
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,842
Now it's not bullshit.

203
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,799
A draft can kill you

204
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,361
What the fuck do you want?
Sit down.

205
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,450
Shit.

206
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,519
You found out who gave me
this gift?

207
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,759
It wasn't the Neapolitans,
we didn't find a thing.

208
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,319
What's the difference?

209
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,599
He was knifed.

210
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,679
Good evening.

211
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,199
We managed to stitch up the
ligament, with the right therapy

212
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,839
you'll walk without a limp.

213
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,919
But can I go back to work?

214
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,999
I don't know yet,
it was a serious lesion,

215
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,879
- you'll need patience.
- Just what I don't have.

216
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:21,283
- Try to find some.
- Good bye.

217
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,285
Think about getting better,
not work.

218
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,649
She's right.

219
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,010
Think about getting better.

220
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,119
I'll find those guys,
it's a promise,

221
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,885
we'll take care of them together.

222
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,970
Bye, Mazinga.

223
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,731
Think I didn't hear your friend?

224
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,650
Giancarlo?

225
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,403
It's turned off.

226
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Hi, Elisa. Listen, make sure parents
park in the right areas, not...

227
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,279
- On the walkway, I know.
- Then do it, or cars can't move.

228
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:29,519
- This isn't a public school.
- Okay, Professor.

229
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,409
It's important.

230
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,009
- Professor of what?
- Who knows, what's the difference?

231
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,327
- You have a shitty job.
- Look who's talking.

232
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,847
What are you doing?
That's a mini-block of fats.

233
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,643
Open for the lady.

234
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,250
Forget it, on your salary
you couldn't even pay for her gas.

235
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,770
Know what tuition is
for this school?

236
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,882
What's the matter, does it piss you
off to be caged up in here?

237
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,766
Shouldn't it?
Is this what we wanted as kids?

238
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,959
I just wanted to see
the Roma Team.

239
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,169
Well, now you get in free
at the stadium.

240
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,925
- How's Mazinga?
- A bum deal.

241
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,279
Does your cousin still
hang around with hooligans?

242
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,046
- My cousin's a jerk.
- That's why I asked you.

243
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,370
Okay.

244
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:51,046
I'll see if he knows anything.

245
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,759
She's kicking me out
and thinks she's right?

246
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,639
Counselor, I'm not signing anything.
Nothing.

247
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,399
Just think,
those guys are colleagues too.

248
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,449
I wish they'd drop
by the Unit someday...

249
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,399
Costantini, what's the difference
between you and them?

250
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,121
- The leash?
- Stop playing tough guy.

251
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,123
Why are you a cop?

252
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,960
And why exactly a riot cop?

253
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,970
You don't even know that?

254
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,844
Turn your brain on,
so you can answer me.

255
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,039
Get your hands out of your pockets,
stand straight, if you can.

256
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,359
Put your beret on.

257
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,807
If you don't respect the uniform,
how can others?

258
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,763
So?
What's his cousin say?

259
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,759
It was Romans hiding as Neapolitans,

260
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,809
they're the ones who did this
to you.

261
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:29,642
Now I just have to find them.

262
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,561
And when you do?

263
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,889
What do you mean?

264
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,446
If you're worried about your leg,
it'll get back to normal.

265
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,519
How do you know that?
You're a fucking cop,

266
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,170
not a doctor.

267
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,319
Your leg hurts? I'm sorry.

268
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,210
But these things pass,

269
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,284
what doesn't is who we are.

270
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,009
Get better fast, damn you.

271
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,199
Joint custody of your daughter,

272
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,159
500 euros a month in alimony

273
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,370
and the house goes to your wife.
Any questions?

274
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,049
If there's nothing else,
you can sign.

275
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,839
- Please, don't send us away.
- Get up.

276
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,491
Don't send us away! Please!

277
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,240
- I'll do whatever you want.
- You have to get up.

278
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,486
- I'll do whatever you want!
- Knock it off.

279
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,371
Now you've pissed me off.

280
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,167
Tone it down.
Our problems stay at home.

281
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,799
Are you all right?
It was nothing.

282
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,882
Please, get up.

283
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,359
We're following the vote-count
of the second local elections ballot

284
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:24,999
in this long spring of elections

285
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,241
with some important differences...

286
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,959
Hello.

287
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,679
- I'm here to meet Enrico Mancini.
- He's in his office.

288
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,445
Adriano! Come here.

289
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,091
- How are you?
- Fine, you?

290
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,251
Sorry for the mess, the election
campaign's in full swing.

291
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,479
You disappeared.

292
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,563
The party still needs guys
like you.

293
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,163
I'm with the police now, riot unit.

294
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,967
Really? How come?

295
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,485
But it suits you,
you always had a mean punch!

296
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,607
Why did you want to see me?

297
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,719
The city wants to kick
my mother out,

298
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,639
they're throwing her out on the
street, she has nowhere to go.

299
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,291
I mean, she has a place,

300
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,319
they assigned her welfare housing,

301
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,159
but it's occupied by illegals.

302
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,839
When will our mayor
ever kick them out?

303
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,879
Pretty soon they'll be giving them
the right to vote.

304
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,439
That's why I called you, maybe...
You could give me a hand.

305
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,090
A hand?

306
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,239
You're not asking a favor,

307
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,119
you're demanding a right,

308
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:44,519
your mother's right
to her own home.

309
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,199
The wind's changing, people
are tired, they want security,

310
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,283
they want to take back
the motherland.

311
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,999
We'll win this time
and with the new mayor

312
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,082
you won't have to ask any favors.

313
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,161
I spoke to Santini,
head of personnel.

314
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,801
I don't even know
if I'll get my leg back, Maria!

315
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,799
Want to keep doing riot control?

316
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,479
I'm a riot cop, are you ashamed?
You're a cop yourself.

317
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,359
Right, you don't have to be
on the street

318
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,279
- to be a good cop.
- And where should I be,

319
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,239
- warming some chair in an office?
- I might be warming a chair,

320
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,639
- but at least I'm trying to raise
my son. - Meaning?

321
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,959
You don't even see he's not around.

322
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,399
That's new? He hasn't come once
since I got here.

323
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,006
For days now, he hasn't
even come by the house.

324
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,930
- What do you mean? Where does
he sleep? - I don't know.

325
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,288
HATED AND PROUD

326
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:20,687
STOP WITH IMMIGRANTS
ITALY FOR ITALIANS

327
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,524
Recreation's over,
we're going home.

328
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,281
Tomorrow you even go back
to school.

329
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,484
Take your hands off.

330
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:07,879
- Who the fuck are you?
- Who are you?

331
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,719
He's a riot cop.

332
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,759
- One that beats up guys at the
game? - I can beat you up here too.

333
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,808
Okay!

334
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,839
Get out, this is our house,
cops aren't welcome.

335
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,279
- Don't you like my face? - I don't
like servants, guys like you,

336
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,519
instead of defending Italians,
you fight kids at the stadium.

337
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,159
So you defend Italians?

338
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,239
A bunch of skinheads
screeching like monkeys?

339
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,239
No, I'm doing your job,

340
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:41,439
making sure this doesn't become
a mosque.

341
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,719
This is our house,
and if you're not Italian,

342
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,199
you'd better go back home.

343
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,682
You convinced me,
in fact, we're going home.

344
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,202
I'm staying here.

345
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,559
Hear that?

346
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,167
Now get out,
this is no place for you.

347
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:17,731
Servant!

348
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,359
- Yo, Cobra. - They still haven't
kicked you out of the country?

349
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,330
They don't make assholes
like me any more.

350
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,119
- And him? - Filling in for Mazinga
for a few days.

351
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,599
- Adriano, this is Mustafa.
- Pleasure.

352
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:46,525
He's kinda dark, but...
he's a brother too.

353
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,410
Know the rules?

354
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,239
Never say I'm a cop,
because moonlighting's illegal,

355
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,719
and if I see anything strange,
I tell Cobra.

356
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,326
No commotion.

357
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,047
Don't worry, he's a good kid.

358
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,444
I'll bring her back for dinner.

359
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,410
Be good.

360
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,130
- You're sure you wanted ice cream?
- Yes.

361
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:55,050
- Then why not eat it?
- I'm waiting for Mommy.

362
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,644
I think you're bored.

363
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,566
- You're bored, right?
- A little.

364
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,359
Carolina,
want to see where Daddy works?

365
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,010
Yes.

366
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,130
Want to?

367
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,330
You do?

368
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,479
Hey, friend!

369
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,439
- Give one cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

370
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,759
Then give money to buy
one cigarette.

371
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,799
Give some money,
some coins to buy one cigarette.

372
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,280
Give me some money?

373
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,041
Are you deaf?
Besides being a nigger?

374
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,883
Nigger, give me money
to buy cigarette.

375
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,007
Go home, no? A few coins!

376
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,926
Coins to buy cigarette.

377
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,162
Come on, nigger, some coins,
to buy cigarette and go away.

378
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,888
Thank you, nigger.

379
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,965
Cobra did this, Daddy's friend,
remember him?

380
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,562
He's good at drawing, isn't he?

381
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,044
When Daddy goes to work,
he dresses like that.

382
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,170
What is it? I can't now.

383
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,769
I have Carolina, how can I?

384
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,171
Okay, on my Wall...

385
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,368
Sicilian,

386
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,569
are you good with kids?
I'll leave her with you for an hour.

387
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:28,119
You got better eyesight,
does it say toilet here?

388
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,159
- Don't think so. - Then why's
this asshole pissing here?

389
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:36,245
- He's talking to you.
- What have you got here?

390
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,969
- If I pissed where your kid plays?
- What the fuck do you want?

391
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:48,609
- Come on, clean up the park.
- Me?

392
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,199
I said to clean the park.

393
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,851
Go on.

394
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,927
Clean up, then fuck off
to your own country.

395
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,724
You missed that.

396
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,959
There's a bottle cap,
don't you see it?

397
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,799
I'm back here tomorrow.

398
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,679
This park's gotta shine!

399
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,559
If you're here, I'll kick your ass,

400
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:20,239
never come back.

401
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,971
Do I pick this up myself?

402
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,924
Complaining?

403
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,199
They're buying tickets home.

404
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,519
Take back our motherland, fuck 'em!

405
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,199
You kick two out,
a hundred come back.

406
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,199
- Better two than nothing.
- Want to beat them all up?

407
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,089
Yeah, all of them.

408
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,959
When was this picture taken?

409
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:51,440
About when you started jerking off.

410
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,879
In Genoa, at the G8 summit in 2001
we're from the Seventh.

411
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,759
- Seventh what?
- Seventh Unit.

412
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,650
A team of 70 real men,

413
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,159
brothers who had just one ideal:
Clean the shit out of Italy.

414
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,679
- Italy. Not two drunks in a park
- That again?

415
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,399
Why, isn't it true?

416
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:13,959
If politicians hadn't screwed us

417
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,159
with that G8 Diaz school story,

418
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,128
this country would be
different now.

419
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,559
When a drunk Romanian
or a fucking hooligan insults you,

420
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,719
he's insulting the State
and you should arrest him.

421
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,239
Now what do they teach
in the course on public order?

422
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,279
- You have to be attacked
before you can intervene. - Get it?

423
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,679
They teach you to bow your head,
respect the shits.

424
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,359
- That's why I left.
- Why don't you tell the truth?

425
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,999
A rock broke your eardrum
at the Roma-Inter game,

426
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,999
and you cracked two heads
and attacked your superior.

427
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,731
You didn't leave,
they kicked you out.

428
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,566
Diet over?

429
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,564
What really happened
at the Diaz school?

430
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,882
The biggest fuck up of our lives

431
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,445
It was a massacre.

432
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,209
I'll be right there.

433
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,159
- Fuck!
- What is it?

434
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,367
I left: Carolina at the barracks.

435
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,525
What is it?
Still the G8 mess?

436
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,965
No.

437
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,799
I'm sorry you weren't there today.

438
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,690
But I don't give a damn, really.

439
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,168
I have other things to think about.

440
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,729
What do you want?

441
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,799
Ever thought about
giving it all up?

442
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,280
Give in? Never.

443
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,482
Tell me something,

444
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,362
how much fun was it today?

445
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,881
How much did you like
cleaning up the park?

446
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,161
- Lots.
- And so?

447
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,203
Would you give it up?

448
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,409
No.

449
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,481
Can I show you something?

450
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,999
That's it...

451
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,049
third floor, where the bike is.

452
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:42,128
Which one's your mother's?

453
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,807
Where the fuck's he from?

454
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:57,087
Want to ask him?

455
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,439
- Who is it?
- Is that you, Rami?

456
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,639
Yeah, who is it?

457
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,211
I was just wondering,

458
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:22,206
with this name, where are you from?

459
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,999
Who are you? What do you want?

460
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Be polite, don't answer
a question with a question,

461
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,845
that's how we do it here.
'Cause in your country?

462
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:38,207
He's talking to his wife,
Ramina's there too.

463
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,530
Put your wife on!
Damn you.

464
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,199
If you not stop, I call police.

465
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,601
Here's some bad news.

466
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,250
I am the police.

467
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,170
Where are you from?

468
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:07,802
- Where are you from?
- Tunisia.

469
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:13,239
- How long have you been in Italy?
- One year.

470
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:18,007
Do you work legally?
Have you got a work visa?

471
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,399
- What do you want from me?
- You don't work legally

472
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,849
and you have no visa,
so you can't stay here.

473
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,210
Right?

474
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,319
- Right?
- I not do anything wrong.

475
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:36,561
Can you stay in Italy or not?

476
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,730
No.

477
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,162
- Are you still there?
- I'm here.

478
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,964
Go back to bed, it's late.
My apologies to your wife.

479
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,324
Let's go,

480
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,486
your politician friend
will get him out, right?

481
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,762
Stealing from your own home?

482
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:16,759
Go ahead, this stuff's
worthless anyway, right?

483
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,119
Like your father.

484
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,039
You know what I do
day and night to give you a future?

485
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,039
At best I'm being hit
by rocks, spit, insults,

486
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:30,199
and at worst,
I can even get knifed!

487
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:35,200
Knock it off! You don't do
this work for me, you like it,

488
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,439
you like playing war,
beating people to death.

489
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:42,808
Want to beat me? Go ahead, beat me.

490
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,039
Take your rags and get out.

491
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,646
Fuck off, get out.

492
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:13,959
Mr. Sartoni says I broke
his two teeth for no reason,

493
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:17,599
he was doing nothing,
and someone seems to believe it.

494
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,444
Keep to the facts against you.

495
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,407
Think I like beating people up?

496
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:30,767
I enjoy it?

497
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,210
You're wrong.

498
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:38,439
Before deciding
who's innocent and who's guilty

499
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,604
you should at least ask yourself
what the riot unit does.

500
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,439
Every Sunday
we face people like Sartoni,

501
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,879
who, in the best of cases,
spit on you,

502
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,168
but when they're real pissed off,
they throw everything at you.

503
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,683
And a good riot cop
has to stand there, immobile,

504
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,761
protecting himself with his shield.

505
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:07,480
Then, when the fans get
even more pissed,

506
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,201
then and only then,

507
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:16,690
if the commanding officer authorizes
us, we can we defend ourselves.

508
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:26,319
At that point, you're in a battle,

509
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:30,519
all you can think of
is how to get home alive.

510
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:33,729
There's just one way to do that,
stay clear-headed.

511
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:37,559
But in those moments
your heart's pounding,

512
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,560
your adrenaline spikes,
you think your head will explode,

513
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,764
you hear nothing,

514
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,529
you only have your brothers
next to you.

515
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,164
Your brothers
are all you can count on.

516
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,923
That's what happens
at the stadium on Sundays.

517
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,999
An ugly black page
for soccer in Sicily.

518
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,006
It all happened
in the final minutes

519
01:02:57,040 --> 01:03:00,839
of the 40th derby,
Catania-Palermo.

520
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,559
Violent clashes broke out
outside the stadium,

521
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:09,959
clashes which caused
the death of a police officer.

522
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,199
Chief Commissioner Filipino Raciti
was hit in the face

523
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,079
by a homemade explosive,
he was taken to Garibaldi Hospital

524
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:21,319
and died there. Unfortunately,
news just in a moment ago,

525
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:25,399
it seems there's another officer
from police headquarters in Catania

526
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,839
who's suspended between life
and death at this moment...

527
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:35,085
A colleague is dead.
A brother.

528
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:40,359
It's useless crying,
it's time to be pissed off.

529
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,919
Tomorrow we all go
to the Ministry of the Interior,

530
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,999
to talk with the Minister,
to say we don't like dying

531
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,764
like dogs!

532
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,767
Let him go out on the streets
to be killed.

533
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,759
It's our right,
you'd better let us go inside.

534
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,759
Better if you go back to the
barracks and no one gets hurt.

535
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:11,159
If I order a charge, they'll be
scraping you off the floor.

536
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,479
Think you're the only ones pissed
off for the death of a colleague?

537
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:15,559
Let us talk to the Minister!

538
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,679
If things are better for everyone,
they are for you too.

539
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,639
We're the police,
it doesn't work that way.

540
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:23,039
We have to watch
our colleagues die on the streets?

541
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,247
Officer, mind your place.

542
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:27,882
What's the deal?

543
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,919
What's the deal?

544
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,641
Put a delegation together
and you can go talk to a supervisor.

545
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:43,683
Two of us are going up,
and they'd better listen!

546
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:54,528
A colleague died,
and no one gives a shit.

547
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,199
They look at you, nod,
make promises.

548
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,202
What did you expect?

549
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:05,607
Think a dead cop
could change things?

550
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,039
Know what I say?
I'm fed up with the Minister,

551
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,522
my son, this job

552
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:19,090
this fucking leg
that's not getting better.

553
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:26,125
The doctor said
I'll limp for the rest of my life.

554
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:30,409
- What are you saying?
- Just what I said.

555
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,239
- What is it?
- A court order,

556
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,242
suspending visitation rights
with your daughter.

557
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,279
But I signed separation papers
that say I can see her.

558
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,759
Before you abandoned her.

559
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,799
I left: her in police barracks,

560
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,201
the safest place in the world.

561
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,125
What can a father do
to get his rights?

562
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:59,039
My daughter's 8 years old
and has the right to have a father,

563
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:03,359
the law says so, and a father
has the right to see his daughter,

564
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:08,360
it's the law. Unless
he's a criminal, but I'm not,

565
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,879
I'm a cop, a servant of the State,

566
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,046
paid to defend everyone's rights.
But who defends mine?

567
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,239
As a father, I have no more rights

568
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,239
you've taken them all away,
like I'm a criminal.

569
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,119
Actually, worse,
because when people come here

570
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:30,799
wanting to attack you
for stealing from them,

571
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:34,999
that's when you want me down here,
saving your asses,

572
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,359
defending your rights and of the
damned people who voted for you!

573
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,250
But I can't see my daughter,

574
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:46,125
because I'm not a cop then,
I'm a criminal.

575
01:06:46,520 --> 01:06:49,479
But that can't be,

576
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,399
either I'm always good for you
or I never am.

577
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:58,645
So if I'm never good for you,
you can take this uniform back.

578
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,649
Get dressed and get out.

579
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,970
Kick me out.

580
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,844
Get your hands off me
or you'll ruin your pretty suit.

581
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,879
Yesterday evening,
just after 8 p.m.,

582
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,442
Giovanna Reggiani was attacked
as she walked along the path...

583
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:20,599
Giovanna Reggiani walked
this path every evening

584
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:25,399
and it's here she was tortured
and raped by a young Romanian

585
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:28,882
from a gypsy camp
about 100 meters away.

586
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,399
A gypsy camp located
in an area City Hall

587
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,839
had promised to clean up.

588
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:39,799
Councilor candidate
Enrico Mancini says

589
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,805
the city had already activated
evacuation procedures.

590
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,959
It's time to think seriously

591
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:00,406
about the Roman outskirts.

592
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,079
We're standing in front
of the Regina Coeli prison,

593
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:10,519
just arriving is the defense
attorney for Romulus Mailat

594
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,359
the 24-year-old Romanian...

595
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,571
You're a piece of shit,
you bastard! You gotta die.

596
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,799
Listen, we have to clear out

597
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,039
Reggiani's murderer's gypsy camp,
get ready.

598
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:32,168
No messes, Cobra.

599
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,439
You're defending them
instead of protecting us?

600
01:09:13,440 --> 01:09:16,079
You should kick them
out of this country.

601
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,839
Turn that way, you clowns!

602
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,571
Clowns? Step back.

603
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:34,119
You came to see the show?

604
01:09:34,120 --> 01:09:37,839
You forgot how to maintain order?

605
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,479
They're calling from everywhere,
anger's growing,

606
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,399
if you don't get these Romanians,
there'll be hell to pay.

607
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:46,159
- Who says?
- The ones who are pissed off.

608
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,759
The ones like you, me, them!

609
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,367
Don't yell, I can hear you.

610
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,359
These Romanians do
what the fuck they want,

611
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,439
we need to show them
this is our motherland.

612
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,331
- It's our home.
- Right!

613
01:10:10,360 --> 01:10:15,082
Ma'am, a euro,
a euro for a sandwich.

614
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,247
I didn't like your show
outside Parliament, not at all.

615
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,759
Article 48?
I'm not crazy.

616
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,719
A psych visit will decide that.

617
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,883
You're on suspension
for the time being.

618
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:12,526
You can go.

619
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,879
If you wanna dance,
I can help you too.

620
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,439
- Why are you here?
- Am I bothering you?

621
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:41,359
What the fuck's this guy looking at?
Did I spoil the party?

622
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,959
You say you're with our kid
but you're screwing him?

623
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,279
- What?
- Want to screw my wife, Cuba?

624
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:49,409
- You're wrong.
- I'm not wrong at all.

625
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,799
What are you doing? I work here,

626
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:54,559
want to get me fired?
Is it revenge?

627
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,239
Take it out on yourself,
not on me.

628
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:01,399
Look at you,
you like playing crazy.

629
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,799
It makes you feel important,
the master of the world!

630
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,879
What do you and your friends say?
"Take back the motherland".

631
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,119
But this isn't your home
and you're not crazy,

632
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:13,521
you're just a poor asshole.

633
01:12:30,280 --> 01:12:34,251
I really fucked up.
I really fucked up.

634
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:40,919
You earn 1,400 euros a month,
with overtime it's 1,800,

635
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:44,159
you do a few jobs off duty
and get to 2,000.

636
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,999
You go to Cuba, you're rich,

637
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:49,999
you meet a girl at a disco,
you tell her you're rich,

638
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,447
she loves you, you marry her,

639
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,639
but when you come back
you're still making 2,000 a month

640
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:59,199
and you each have nothing to say.

641
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:03,524
You go back to being a fucking cop
and a Cuban whore.

642
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:06,599
But he shouldn't have had a kid.

643
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:08,250
What do you want to do?

644
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,644
Nero's a brother,

645
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:14,479
brothers make mistakes,
but you don't abandon them.

646
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,768
- He hit his wife!
- You don't abandon brothers.

647
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,210
Ever.

648
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,603
- You've seen a doctor?
- What did you come for?

649
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:36,203
- To fix this thing.
- It can't be fixed any more.

650
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:41,279
Miriam,
Nero made a mistake, but...

651
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,959
the two of you have
to resolve this

652
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,645
just between you.

653
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,199
Talk to each other and
things go back like they were.

654
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:56,199
I say this for your good,
and especially for your daughter's.

655
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,759
Who are you to talk about
the good of my daughter?

656
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,599
You just don't want your friend
to go to jail for beating me.

657
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:05,319
He has to, his place is in jail.

658
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:10,531
Nero's already in trouble, if you
report him now, he'll lose his job!

659
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,123
Then who'll support your daughter?

660
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,607
You thought about that?

661
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:21,839
You're using my daughter
to save his ass,

662
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:25,606
you're a shit just like him,
get out.

663
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,568
What's there to look at?

664
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,400
Understand, Ma'am?
I'm sorry, this is all I can do.

665
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,639
For the moment,

666
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:57,201
the city assigns you a hotel room,
it's not much, but...

667
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,166
You can keep your charity.

668
01:15:05,680 --> 01:15:10,720
Put that stuff down.
Put that fucking stuff down!

669
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,490
Careful, I'll report you for verbal
abuse of a police officer.

670
01:15:34,160 --> 01:15:35,810
The judge.

671
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:47,009
According to article 530.2
of the Code of Criminal Procedure...

672
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:34,320
Acquitted!

673
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,839
My new address,

674
01:16:54,840 --> 01:16:57,559
you might need it
to come asking for my vote.

675
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,479
I'm sorry, I need time.

676
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:04,279
You need time? My mother's living
in a 35-square meter cellar

677
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:08,171
for 700 euros a month,
that's all we can afford.

678
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:12,119
There's not only your mother,
but lots of people,

679
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,359
it's a complex problem...

680
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,839
A right's a right,
nothing fucking 'complex' about it.

681
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,559
My mother has a right to that house,
but she can't move in

682
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,079
because the State's lost respect for
itself, for the rules, for rights,

683
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,687
because it's governed
by pieces of shit like you.

684
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,799
I see why you're a riot cop:
Because you're an idiot.

685
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,280
Only an idiot can be a riot cop.

686
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,642
Now call the cops, asshole.

687
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:54,279
- You're sure? - The ones
who knifed Mazinga are there,

688
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:57,519
- definitely.
- Why doesn't Special Ops go?

689
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:02,520
What's the problem? They're there
and we'll go get 'em, they're ours!

690
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,806
- Let's call Special Ops.
- Why? - Leave it to them.

691
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,759
We'll go get 'em,

692
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,603
and call our Special Ops afterward.

693
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:17,767
What do we do?

694
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:25,370
Let's go.

695
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,126
- We'll go get them.
- Fuck 'em.

696
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,925
If you don't want to come,
you can go home.

697
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,770
Knock it off.

698
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:19,883
Riot police, sons-of-bitches...

699
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,168
- Knock that off. - Don't like
the music or the lyrics?

700
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,690
Stop!

701
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,082
It was hidden in the bathroom.

702
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,530
It's full of blades.

703
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,484
And there's this too.

704
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:33,409
They're the ones who beat up
the Albanians at the supermarket.

705
01:22:40,760 --> 01:22:43,079
Take your son home,

706
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,199
tell him to forget everything,
forever.

707
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:48,279
I'll reset these guys' memories,

708
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:52,683
if they want to tell,
the bag goes to the judge.

709
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,199
- Call Special Ops
- Not today.

710
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:01,599
- Do it now.
- I said no, today's a tie.

711
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:04,843
Today's a tie? We're the police.

712
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,239
Or are these speeches
only for the others?

713
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,720
- That guy's the son of a brother.
- He's a shit.

714
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:14,119
Him and his friends knife
our brothers,

715
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,647
- or have you forgotten?
- Today it ends right here.

716
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,371
- Is that clear?
- No, it's not.

717
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,039
- It's not right.
- Want to call the cops? Go ahead.

718
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:28,202
But you have to do it.

719
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,679
I'm not getting a brother
in trouble,

720
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,162
not even when he smashes
some guy's face on a train.

721
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,919
Go home, take a shower,

722
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:53,003
and forget,
because nothing happened today.

723
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,447
Nothing happened.

724
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,850
What happened?

725
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,690
Nothing.

726
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,007
Will you tell me what happened?

727
01:24:56,720 --> 01:25:01,009
Nothing... nothing happened!

728
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,079
Hide this bag,
it's our life insurance.

729
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:15,239
- A shit life.
- Whatever you like,

730
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:17,686
but put this fuckin' bag away.

731
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,121
Go away or I'll call for help.

732
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:49,049
Last night I was about to smash
in Giancarlo's head, Mazinga's son.

733
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:52,207
I wanted to slaughter him,

734
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,799
because him and his friends
knifed his father.

735
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:57,879
His friends knifed his father

736
01:25:57,880 --> 01:26:00,008
and I wanted to kill his son.

737
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,848
What do you want from me?

738
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,606
Let me see Carolina again.

739
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,439
Please,

740
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,920
she's the only nice thing I have.

741
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,490
Please.

742
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:30,529
- Hello.
- Come in.

743
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:41,280
Why did you ask to see me?

744
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:51,090
What is it?

745
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:59,086
Aggravated assault?
Is this a joke?

746
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,719
What do you want him for?

747
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:05,599
He's accused of the attempted murder
of three Albanians.

748
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:07,807
And this is for you.

749
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:37,171
Five minutes, then leave,
only because you're a colleague.

750
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,210
Thank you.

751
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:51,479
Listen to me... When the judge
questions you, deny everything.

752
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,839
Clashes at the stadium,
beating up the Albanians,

753
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,959
you know nothing,
you didn't do anything.

754
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:02,960
Understand?
Are you listening?

755
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:04,999
Yeah, you want me to say
I wasn't there,

756
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:08,279
but I was and I want it known
I did the right thing.

757
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:10,599
- What?
- I did what had to be done!

758
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:13,439
These guys steal our jobs,
they rape and kill,

759
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:17,439
someone has to deal with it,
since you and your friends don't.

760
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:20,959
So you and your friends will?
What is it?

761
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:25,045
You're scared if I tell the truth,
that you'll be mixed up in it?

762
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,611
I'm already mixed up in it.

763
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,930
I've been mixed up in it
my whole life.

764
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:43,649
You're sixteen,

765
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:49,763
don't ruin yourself, Giancarlo,
don't ruin your life.

766
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:58,039
As long as you're under
investigation,

767
01:28:58,040 --> 01:29:00,088
this is the best thing

768
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,250
It's for your own good.

769
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,529
You're a rat.

770
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,123
You're hiding, huh?

771
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:42,771
Good for you.
You shouldn't be afraid,

772
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:47,689
no one wants to dirty their hands
with a guy like you.

773
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,961
Know why? Because you're worth
less than this piss.

774
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:15,079
- So, what are you worth?
- You have the nerve to talk?

775
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:18,479
Nero and Mazinga are screwed
because of you, they'll be suspended

776
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:22,559
and then discharged.
You're a traitor.

777
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:25,879
So, what are you, cops?

778
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:30,519
Riot cops,
who piss and spit on their uniforms,

779
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:34,199
every time you cover your ass
and your friends'.

780
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:38,079
No, you ain't shit now,
you're fucking nothing.

781
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:41,766
Next time I see you, I'll kill you.

782
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:47,886
I wanted an honest job,
and being a cop's an honest job.

783
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,291
That's why I'm in the police.

784
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:11,199
It was no accident,
the cop shot to kill, understand?

785
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:14,239
Everyone in Rome knew Gabriele,
he was a good kid,

786
01:32:14,240 --> 01:32:17,359
a brother, and the cops killed him.

787
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:21,319
Explain why, when Raciti died,
they suspended all the games

788
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:24,759
and instead, today the games are on.
Where's the justice?

789
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,359
There is none.

790
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:30,160
A 28 year-old guy
isn't worth a cop.

791
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:36,919
It's 4 p.m., welcome back
on the air. A Sunday to forget.

792
01:32:36,920 --> 01:32:41,159
A young man of 26, Gabriele Sandri,
was killed this morning

793
01:32:41,160 --> 01:32:44,359
at a rest stop
along the A1 highway, near Alvarez.

794
01:32:44,360 --> 01:32:46,599
The victim is a Lazio Team fan,

795
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:50,319
hit by the gunfire
of a police officer.

796
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,039
His name is Gabriele Sandri,
it was a tragic error,

797
01:32:54,040 --> 01:32:57,599
as announced this afternoon
by the Alvarez Chief of Police.

798
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,879
We'll go to the rest stop

799
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,201
with our correspondent...

800
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:10,004
Get ready, we're dancing tonight.

801
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:15,399
Carletto, what is it?

802
01:33:15,400 --> 01:33:18,359
They're organizing.
Roma fans, Lazio fans, skinheads,

803
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,319
all out to get you.

804
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,519
They're meeting at the stadium,

805
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,285
they want to kill a cop,
an eye for an eye.

806
01:33:26,520 --> 01:33:28,359
We're right here.

807
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:31,479
Fuck you, they want a corpse!

808
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:33,323
Bye.

809
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,599
- Everyone outside, we're leaving.
- The game's been canceled.

810
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:42,159
But not our assignment.
Come on, guys, move your asses.

811
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:46,519
Inspector, don't send just the guys
on duty, it's not enough.

812
01:33:46,520 --> 01:33:47,799
Want to send the army?

813
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,119
The shits are organizing,

814
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:53,359
there's thousands of 'em,
they're pissed off, we're too few.

815
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,199
- These are the orders.
- They're crap.

816
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:58,879
Get promoted,
then you can give the orders.

817
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,479
Then you don't understand,

818
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,087
the politicians want our blood,
they want another Raciti

819
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,682
to make people forget the screw-up
of one jerk in a uniform.

820
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,690
You'd prefer to be exempted
from duty?

821
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:15,721
Exempt my ass.

822
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:27,324
I have to pick up
my personal belongings.

823
01:39:20,280 --> 01:39:25,446
Now I feel safe, with a cripple
and a nut job covering my ass.

824
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,209
What was the name
of that school in Genoa?

825
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,247
I bet we pay for it tonight.

826
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,560
Here they come!
