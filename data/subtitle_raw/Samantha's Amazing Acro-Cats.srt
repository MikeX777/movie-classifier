Every day I wake up,
my back hurts.

What day does it all fall apart?

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,623
I don't know.

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,300
I think my worst fear
is getting old.

[plucky intro music]

21
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,300
[Samantha]
I knew I wanted to
be an animal trainer since
I was seven years old.

22
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,638
Any time you train an animal,
you achieve that moment

23
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,707
where they understand,
they get the trick.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,709
-It's called
the light bulb moment.
-[bell dings]

25
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:27,447
Where you see the little
light bulb go off in their eyes.

26
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,516
When the raccoon
finally understands

27
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,950
that you're supposed
to take the basketball

28
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,585
and put it through the hoop.

29
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:34,420
That's an amazing moment.

30
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,224
You feel like this, like a
little bit of an electric wave

31
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,492
between you and the animal,

32
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,861
so there's a sort of telepathy.

33
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:49,269
The first animal I trained
was a dog and then a ferret
and then a rat.

34
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:51,538
I'm Samantha and this is Julie.

35
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:53,907
We're from Samantha's
Amazing Animals,

36
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,577
also known as
Rat Company and Friends.

37
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,746
I became known as
the "Rat Lady of Chicago".

38
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:00,813
Whoo!

39
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,752
-Samantha!
-Hey, Pauly!

00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:07,854
[Pauly] What are you doing?
Oh God! Oh God!

00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:09,556
-[Samantha] Oh, my rat!
-Ah!

42
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,391
Do you have real rats, though?

43
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,493
We got a whole room
full of rats waiting for you.

44
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:17,363
Come on up.
Come on, he's really friendly.

45
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,032
I don't like rats, man.
I'm not into that whole thing.

46
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,967
I mean they're nice and stuff,
I think they're cool,

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,269
but you're The Rat Woman,
I'm The Weaz.

48
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,672
Weaz and rats aren't
a good combination.

49
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,975
It got me a lot of talk shows,
but it didn't go anywhere.

50
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:35,915
[Samantha]
About five years ago,
I decided that I really wasn't
happy doing what I was doing.

51
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:41,588
I had an exotic zoo, and I was
doing educational programs
for schools and libraries.

52
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,857
So I thought: "Well,
you know, let's go with cats."

53
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,393
[ding, ding]

54
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:48,528
Okay, Tuna.

55
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:50,697
Kitty, kitty! Come on.

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,398
Over here.

57
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:53,800
Over here.

58
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,001
Good job!

59
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:58,471
Roll. Roll.

60
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,040
[Samantha]
I guess I just got bored
with dogs over the years

61
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,777
and find it more rewarding
to work with an animal

62
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:08,648
that gives you a hard time.
Actually, it's a lot of work.

63
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,718
It gets harder each year,
more expensive each year,

64
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,420
but uhm, I want to do this
for the rest of my life.

65
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,056
And I plan on working
until the day I die.

66
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,692
There's no retirement
in the animal world.

67
00:04:25,965 --> 00:04:27,667

I'm one of those fortunate
people that actually

68
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,936
got to, you know be,

69
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:31,971
do what I wanted
to be when I grew up

70
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,507
although I'm not really
totally grown up yet.

71
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,576
Yeah, I don't think you can.
If I grow up totally,

72
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,711
then there's no way I can
live this kind of lifestyle.

73
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:41,014
It's not, well a grown up
does not

74
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,515
sleep on the side of the road

This is Lynsi.

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,742
I know a couple of you
are probably wondering:

97
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,110
"Do all those cats
live with her?"

98
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,179
Yes, yes all the cats
do live with me.

99
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,148
This is actually set up
in my living room.

100
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,717
And the band over there
is set up in my kitchen.

101
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,619
That is my kitchen table,
in fact.

102
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,157
I eat standing up or in my car

103
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,193
because not everything tastes
better with cat fur in it.

[Samantha] Living the dream.

105
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:30,149
[Lynsi]
I've been working
with Samantha for two years.

106
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,985
It's like Night
of the Living Dead.

107

Zombies! Back!

108
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,257
I think I had
like a career crisis

109
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,827
when I was like
getting close to 30?

110
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,230
But now like, everything
sort of come together.

111
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:46,732
He, he, okay.

112
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,101
What is it about Samantha,
though, that attracts people?

113
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,305
It's because she lives this life
that people think about

114
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:55,541
and, you know,
they're too afraid to do it.

115
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:00,780
If we could just stay
on the road, that's what
both of us like to do.

116
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,896
[gentle guitar music plucks]

117
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,298
[Samantha] All right,
now, the question is

118
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:24,103
which credit card is going
to work to fill up this beast?
That's a great question.

119
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:28,641
Pick a card, any card.
Let's try, this is
the one we want to use.

120
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,078
And this is probably
the one we'll have to use.

121
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,747
My costs are insane.

122
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,986
I have to make $3,000
a week to break even.

123
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:43,990
It's like I can see
the island of gold,

124
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,592
but the ice is cracking
beneath my feet [chuckles].

125
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,095
So I'm like: "Oh, am I
going to make it there

126
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:51,697
before the ice cracks
and I fall through?

127
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,666
Am I going to make it
to the island of gold?

128
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,843
[cabaret music]

129
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,612
I've done a lot
of production work,

130
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,014
and I need to focus
on the produ...

131
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,016
on like the production
end of things.

132
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:14,320
So, you know, I've got
all these videos and pictures,

133
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:17,623
and I've been trying, you know
I've been trying to get them to
post it so they can...

134
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:20,927
I mean basically, I need my
website totally revamped

135
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,796
so that it's promoting
more production work.

136
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,197
I mean, like we're--
we like live in a bubble.

137
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,899
we don't know what's going on.

138
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:35,074
[Samantha] Hi, Caesar, it's mom.
I told you I'd be home.

139
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:38,311
Short trip this time. Hi!

140
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,113
Doesn't really even feel
like I have a home,

141
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,982
it feels more like
I have a work,

142
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:46,185
and I just sleep on the couch
of my work every day.

143
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:50,423
Dakota! Pinky!

144
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,124
You're gonna miss band practice.

145
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:54,660
Can you do this standing up?

146
00:09:54,694 --> 00:10:00,099
-[drum beats]
-[Samantha] Good job.

147
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,368
I have three different cats
that play the keyboard.

148
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:05,171
Pinky's the only guitar player
that plays this guitar,

149
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,106
and she's always here
for band practice.

150
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,308
The one day that she wasn't,
it turned out she was sick.

151
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:12,011
I had to rush her to the vet
she had a fever of like a 104.

152
00:10:12,044 --> 00:10:15,281
Ah Caesar, no. Caesar,
I know what you're doing.

153
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,017
Don't call me an asshole
in front of the TV people.

154
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,887
Did you hear that? He said A...
He goes: "Ass, Ass."

155
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,824
You have to listen for it,
but he mutters under his breath.

156
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,130
[Samantha] I came from
Pleasantville.

157
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:34,867
My parents had
the perfect marriage,
like what you see on television.

158
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,936
They lived for the kids.

159
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,471
That's where
I lost my virginity,

160
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:41,040
in the backyard
right uh, by the cornfield.

161
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,111
So this is Lincoln
Elementary School.

162
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,946
That's where
the hell first started.

163
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:49,915
You know, I was bullied.

164
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:51,150
I mean I was not--

165
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:52,985
I did not get along at all here.

166
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,490
And I was really kind of
an ugly duckling too,

167
00:10:57,523 --> 00:11:00,059
so I was like
not accepted at all.

168
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:02,228
And guys would
ask me out as a joke.

169
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,964
Once I hit high school,
I was very boy-crazy.

170
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,434
I mean I, you know, if a guy
found out I had a crush on them,
they're like, "Ew!"

171
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,435
I was a cootie.

172
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,237
So it was not uh--

173
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,105
it was not a good time
for me at all.

174
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:18,177
[gentle melancholic music]

175
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,057
Dad?

176
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,091
Hey, dad.

177
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,366
[Warner] Samantha was born
in New Castle, Indiana.

178
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,269
Then we moved to Dallas,
Michigan,

179
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:48,340
where she did her grade school
up to the fifth grade.

180
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,844
And she was
extremely happy there.

181
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:57,183
When she got to Princeton,
it was very bad for her.

182
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,421
She was shy,
wasn't accepted too well.

183
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:04,990
She just didn't
have any friends.

184
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,028
She always had cats around.

185
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:12,498
As her life developed,

186
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,068
she found some
relationship with animals

187
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,838
that helped fill the void
of some of these girls

188
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:21,006
she would have liked
to be friends with.

189
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:27,279
She told me just the other day
that she, she cried herself
to sleep every night.

190
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:33,252
If it wasn't for her animals,
which she was always
involved in,

191
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:34,854
I don't know what we'd have.

192
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:46,398
We need that right person
to see our show

193
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,435
and to see that, you know,
the potential for money making.

194
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,840
We need sold out shows.

195
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:56,242
National publicity.

196
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,943
We need a proper agent.

197
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,347
Hi uh, are you
a cat lover at all?

198
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,515
Uhm, yeah.

199
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,083
Because we have a show tomorrow.

200
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,419
I don't know
if any of you who live
around here are cat lovers,

201
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:11,624
we have a show tomorrow
featuring trained amazing cats.

202
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:12,992
[store owner] Oh my!

203
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,197
Here, come on. Have a seat.

204
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:28,507
[Lynsi]
We are definitely learning
that we work for each other.

205
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,509
-Yeah, I know.
-Seems obvious, but--

206
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,145
But a lot of times
it hasn't been my fault.

207
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:34,480
Yeah.

208
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,383
We've had venues that have said:

209
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:40,119
"Okay, we're going to let you
book our theatre."

210
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,290
And then when we try to get
back to them to narrow down
the time and the day,

211
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:48,327
they don't call us back.
And then we finally trick them
into picking the phone up

212
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,629
by calling under
a different number.

213
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:54,233
And they pick up,
and then we find out
that they changed their minds

214
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,669
and decided our show
wasn't a fit for their venue.

215
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:58,671
Or they think it's a kids' show.

216
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:00,172
And it's really not.

217
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:06,312
I mean, kids can enjoy it,
but the humor is adult-oriented.

218
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,948
It's been happening
quite a bit lately. It's, its--

219
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,382
It kind of feels like dating.

220
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,186
Hey, Aaron.

221
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,654
Here, take some postcards.

222
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,289
Hand them to strangers.

223
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:20,025
I'll buy you liquor and food.

224
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,665
Hopefully this isn't going to be
a rags to shopping carts story,

225
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,402
[laughs] Hopefully it goes
the other way, rags to riches.

226
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,014
[typing]

227
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,594
[Samantha] I'm really anxious.

228
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,130
And I really
didn't do much makeup.

229
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:01,667
-I mean-- I can tell.
-You can tell?

230
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:04,036
I think you should put a
little sparkle eye stuff on.

231
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,537
What am I missing? My ears!

232
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,075
Should I do another shot,
do you think?

233
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,176
Yeah?

234
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,264
Tuna, the light!

235
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,403
[crowd laughs]

236
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,607
-It's the light right there.
-[crowd cheers]

237
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:45,344
[circus music]

238
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,234
-Tuna! Tuna!
-She's making a break for it.

239
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,436
Is she making a break for it?

240
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,038
Yeah. This way. Tuna!

241
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,174
[Samantha whistles] Tuna.

242
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,241
Really?

243
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,088
[audience laughs]

244
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,368
The show was terrible, really.
Buffy was a wreck.

245
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:45,771
What was the matter, Buffy?
What happened?

246
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,640
She didn't, she act like she's
never seen the stage before.

247
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:52,745
Pudge, who is usually
pretty bomb-proof...

248
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,316
I, Pudge what happened?

249
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:58,717
What happened?

250
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,719
[shakes cat food] Who else?

251
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,254
Who else disappointed me?

252
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,425
I'm gonna blame
Samantha's anxiety for it.

253
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,627
They do pick up on it.

254
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:17,603
[Samantha] Uh, well we know
one of the cats had
a little digestive issue.

255
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:19,671
And crapped in the carrier.

256
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,273
And it's pretty icky.

257
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:22,808
So I'm rinsing it out.

258
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:28,180
Good fertilizer, uhm--

259
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:33,285
It's not, it's one of
the less glamorous aspects
of this cat circus.

260
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:37,222
I'm like out here,
some days there aren't
any glamorous aspects

261
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:41,360
[laughing] to the cat circus.

262
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,696
[Lynsi] One of the neat things
about Samantha and one of
the frustrating things is

263
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,466
that she doesn't always think
things all the way through.

264
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,805
If she had sat down
and planned out this cat circus
from start to finish,

265
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,341
it would have probably
been so overwhelming
it would have never happened.

266
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,777
So it's almost like she had
to just throw herself into it

267
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:02,681
and see what happens,
and then it is really
difficult, but it's like:

268
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,517
"Well, I've already gone
this far. I'm just
gonna keep on going."

269
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,718
And she does.

270
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,156
I mean, she, she wants to do
what she wants to do
to be happy.

271
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,159
I mean, she really is like
putting it all out there

272
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:18,630
for this cat circus, you know.
It's like do or die. [chuckles]

273
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:23,836
[Samantha] They're always
gonna screw me over.
I just don't know which one,

274
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:29,208
which one is gonna fail me,
which one is gonna make me look
like an idiot. It's exhausting.

275
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:32,244
I had to put a lot of energy--
That's why I don't want to
talk to anybody after the show.

276
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:39,451
Keeping that energy up
and trying to keep the show
funny and flowing

277
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:42,387
while keeping the animals on cue

278
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,791
and have, you know, just that
whole thing mixed together.

279
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,860
It's what I was doing
in my living room

280
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,929
and now it's out of my living
room, in front of a crowd,

281
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,198
and I'm shy, terribly shy.

282
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,803
The killer of a cat show
is when you're like

283
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,672
a nervous wreck because then
the cats are like:
"Why are you nervous?

284
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:03,442
Now we're nervous. Now we're
gonna really fuck you over."

285
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,577
[Lynsi] Samantha gets a little
nervous. It's her show,

286
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:07,946
so the pressure is really
on her you know,

287
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,515
and I just try to help.

288
00:19:09,548 --> 00:19:10,716
[laughs]

289
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,584
-So I'll take...
-Okay, okay.

290
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:14,887
The chicken will go across,
then I'll take that off

291
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,923
leave the chicken there
put Dallas on the cart,
whistle him back,

292
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:19,725
and then you'll have
all the time to deal with that.

293
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:22,828
Okay, all right.
Okay, I'll try to remember that.

294
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,846
-Like here?
-[Aaron] Take a look
at something real quick, okay?

295
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:41,980
Okay.

296
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,924
[Samantha]
As I get older,
time just slips by.

297
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,761
So many times I thought
my ship was gonna come in.

298
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,966
My sleeping schedule
and my work habits,

299
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:05,671
and you know,
it's really surprising
that I'm not dead or in jail.

300
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,639
But now that I am alive.

301
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,975
God, I hope I can check out
by like 62 or something.

302
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,010
That would be--
seem like good, 62.

303
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:18,250
What am I gonna do? Wheel out
on stage? "Welcome to the show!"

304
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,722
I can buy myself
another ten years on stage

305
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:27,426
with uh, plastic surgery
and exercise.

306
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:31,663
You know as long
as I stay in good health
and keep myself in shape,

307
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:34,032
both mentally and physically,

308
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,868
then there's no reason why I
can't just continue to perform.

309
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,872
You know, I've been
chasing a dream

310
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:44,710
and never really--

311
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:48,313
Uh, there's so many things
I don't know.

312
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,514
I just have to work harder.

313
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,747
Things are looking good.

314
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,031
I know, I really
you know, part of me thinks:

315
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,668
"Am I just gonna be a one-hit
wonder?" Am I gonna be,
you know, another uh,

316
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:46,905
ah ha, you know
just that once, you know.

317
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:48,974
I'm just gonna end up, you know,

318
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:52,978
oh, you know, I'll be like:
"All a bunch of assholes."

319
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,980
You know?

320
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:57,449
[Samantha] I don't want to
end up like that.

321
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,585
It's just struggling
and frustrating because
I get setbacks, and--

322
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,023
So yeah, that's my,
that's my drama.

323
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,359
[Letterman theme tune]

324
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:13,565
Towels, gloves, shoes,
children's toys.

325
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:16,635
-One night, how many?
-Eleven. Eleven different
things.

326
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:21,106
Do you remember the first item?
To me, it was a piece of glove
that was on our bed.

327
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,177
-A little Latex glove, I thought
Jim left it on the bed.
-Right.

328
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,012
-[audience laughs]
-It wasn't me.

329
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:28,914
[laughs] Very little.

330
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,984
[Samantha] The cat had stole
some neighbor's bra went viral,

331
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,588
not the cat band with amazing
cats playing instruments.

332
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,957
And here we're back down
trying to find venues.

333
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,426
So I might not have a job
for like two months.

334
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,833
So, what about you?

335
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:52,871
-Oh yes the
perfect woman, right?
-Yeah, the perfect woman.

336
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,140
-She works for Ringling.
-Yeah.

337
00:22:57,909 --> 00:23:00,545
[circus music]

338
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:17,662
They make her look good.

339
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:25,036
[Samantha] I feel like they
don't have the same kind of
attitude about animals.

340
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:30,008
They aren't pets.
The problem with my cats
is that they're pets.

341
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:31,877
Tex!

342
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:37,549
Tex! Focus, focus!

343
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:40,051
[Samantha]
Why have an animal if it's
just going to be a possession?

344
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:43,021
Well you know, if there's
really any joy in that?

345
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:46,091
Feels like there should be
some sort of relationship there.

346
00:23:46,124 --> 00:23:49,261
If you're going
to have a relationship,
you have to spend quality time.

347
00:23:49,294 --> 00:23:52,964
It's an activity
that both animal
and human can do together.

348
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,671
[Samantha] I've got
a lot of cats.

349
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:01,239
I'm not gonna tell you how many.

350
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,209
But I will say that I am single.

351
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:06,545
[audience laughs and claps]

352
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:11,082
And I will probably
stay that way.

353
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:14,052
[crowd applauds]

354
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,591
If you're gonna do cats,
you really have to
immerse yourself

355
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,126
and just deal with
the "crazy cat lady" stigma.

356
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,795
It's like: "ooh, how many cats
do you have?"

357
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:26,231
I mean, it's like
I'm a leper or something.

358
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,167
It's like: "Seriously, people,
it's my job. It's what I do."

359
00:24:29,201 --> 00:24:32,704
Yes, I love what I do. I like
guys that have cat allergies

360
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,172
because then they can never
set foot in here

361
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,575
and then they never know,
they never see it.

362
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,610
Because that's like could be
the breaking point you know,

363
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,979
They see it, they're like
you know their eyes get--

364
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,881
It's killed the social life.

365
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:45,684
When I was a rat lady,
I got so much game.

366
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:49,921
All those cute little punk
rock boys, you know.
So it's now the cat--

367
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,790
And I keep trying: "No, it's not
cat lady, it's cat woman."

368
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,158
A little bit more,
you know, appeal.

369
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,738
[circus music]

370
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,644
[crowd applauds]

371
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,848
[whispering] Look at her,
look at the flirty stance.

372
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,784
[laughs]

373
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:21,786
We have to lower this.

374
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,189
-Top one first?
-Uh, all right, top one first.

375
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,168
[clattering]

376
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:46,311
I just have to, uh--
I'm gonna give that
pizza crust to the rats.

377
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,613
Or let her--
No, the chickens go--

378
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:49,948
Everything's gonna
go back there.

379
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,886
[clatter and cats meowing]

380
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,255
[Samantha] Pinky!
Can you make it down?

381
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,190
Hmm?

382
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,326
This is usually like
a deal breaker with guys.

383
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,129
When they see them all like
massed together like this,

384
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:07,132
it's like, "Ooh.
How many cats do you have?"

385
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:09,134
Wow, and then they count,
One, two--

386
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,875
I'm just kinda going with it
because he's all happy and giddy

387
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:21,880
so I'm like: "Okay. Well,
I'm kinda happy and giddy too."
I'm a romantic girl. I really--

388
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:25,317
People don't think I am,
but I really am
a super romantic girl.

389
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:28,053
And I love that
teenage love feeling.

390
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,221
I really, really
like Stewart a lot.

391
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:37,929
[calm guitar music]

392
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,219
Oh, and Aaron
texted me last night.

393
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:04,689
-What was with the late texting?
-I know because he was like,
sleeping question mark,

394
00:27:04,723 --> 00:27:08,693
and I was sleeping, so I was
just gonna leave it alone,
but something made me feel like

395
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,895
he just needed
to talk or something.

396
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:12,731
He's like: "Aw,
I was just missing you."

397
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,966
He's trying to find
a flight, like out on Saturday

398
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,036
and leave the next day
to surprise me.

399
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,304
It wasn't working out.

400
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,773
-Aw.
-I know. He's so sweet.

401
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,409
-Hm.
-He is.

402
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:26,811
-They're gonna find him dead.
-What?

403
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:30,148
They're gonna find him dead
because he misses you so much,

404
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,717
he's just, he's gonna
just die, you know.

405
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,687
And it'll be like, yeah,
cause of death missing Lynsi.

406
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,158
I view the guy as my reward.

407
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:42,861
You know, I work hard
all week or whatever

408
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:48,099
and then I get to spend time
with, you know, somebody that's
my... the guy of my life.

409
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,269
If he's here every day,
it no longer becomes a reward,

410
00:27:51,302 --> 00:27:53,204
it becomes a responsibility.

411
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:56,841
You know, I don't think married
means being miserable.

412
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:00,478
-You do. [scoffs]
-Yes, I do.

413
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,480
[laughs] Oh my God.

414
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,016
This relationship
is making me happy

415
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,352
and then if it goes
the other way where I'm less--

416
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:11,356
Where I'm more miserable
than happy, then I am dead.
That's just, you know--

417
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:14,459
You know, some people like
to work through these things
and talk about stuff.

418
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,929
Hm. That's interesting.

419
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,164
Good for them.

420
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,399
-[both laugh]
-Good for them.

421
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,973
[jolly piano music]

422
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:38,483
And now in just a moment we're
going to have the cat band play.

423
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,919
They're the only cat band
in the world. The Rock Cats.

424
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,023
Pinky on guitar.

425
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,791
Nuy on keyboards.

426
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:49,360
And Fiji on drums.

427
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,362
[drum beats]

428
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,843
I was planning
on bringing Stewart home

429
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:06,845
for Thanksgiving and Christmas
and stuff, you know.

430
00:29:07,946 --> 00:29:12,784
And, uh, I decided to break up
with him instead.

431
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:18,056
Figured if I could--
because I think my dad
would have liked him a lot.

432
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,392
So I thought, Oh, you know
I'll bring home a nice guy,
for a change.

433
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,895
I was just bored.

434
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,263
I was bored.

435
00:29:25,296 --> 00:29:26,998
We had nothing in common.

436
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,901
Yeah, I had to pull the plug.

437
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:35,473
I'm going to cook
my mother's famous stuffing.

438
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:40,211
[Warner] Her mother's in
a nursing home.

439
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:43,281
She got to see
her first show down here,

440
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,317
but she sat in
the Alzheimer's section, so...

441
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,520
She doesn't know her,

442
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:52,390
doesn't know Sam,
doesn't know me.

443
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:53,925
It's a hard thing.

444
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,428
So, essentially

445
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:03,434
her, her brother dead,

446
00:30:04,435 --> 00:30:06,204
her mother out of it,

447
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,339
Sam is all I got.

448
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:11,543
Other than this damn cat.

449
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:21,052
[Samantha] I asked the doctor
yesterday about my mom.

450
00:30:21,085 --> 00:30:25,523
And the doctor said that:
"Well, I'd be surprised if
she lived past the summer."

451
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:28,359
And then he's like,
"I wouldn't be surprised

452
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:31,396
if your dad went before you
mom." And I was like oh--

453
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:33,164
[ahem]
So that was kind of like--

454
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,966
I wasn't really
expecting to hear that.

455
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,370
So he could go at any time,
and I would be like loaded with
guilt because I don't

456
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:41,272
come home often enough.

457
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,275
I mean, and a lot of it
is my schedule

458
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,045
and there's a lot
of stuff to do.

459
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:50,315
I mean, I'm finding
the time to jet off to,

460
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:53,051
you know,
Key West for four days.

461
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:56,588
But I'm not finding the time
to come here like once a month.

462
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,123
So, I mean, I feel
kind of guilty about that but,

463
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,126
I just don't want to.

464
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,430
It's depressing.
It's like, it's , it's uhm--

465
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,235
That's where I feel like
I'm a horrible, selfish person.

466
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:35,093
Pinky loves me the best.

467
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:37,662
And I love her the best.

468
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:39,397
And, you know, we have this--

469
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,566
She slept on my pillow
every night,

470
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,669
and, you know,
she growls if I move her.

471
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:46,638
And those blue eyes.

472
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:48,039
[guitar twang]

473
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,645
[Samantha]
I have a lot of cats
to take care of.

474
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,381
And the medical bills,

475
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,183
and all, you know, their
medical bills as well as mine.

476
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,685
I'm really not prepared.

477
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,654
[typing]

478
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:16,301
[Samantha]
If I don't succeed,
that's not an option.

479
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:26,344
There's so many things I don't
know about, like how to do--

480
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:28,346
Because my parents
took care of so much.

481
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:34,619
I just have to work harder,
and I'm tired, to be honest.

482
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,554
I'm really tired.

483
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:39,457
I'm getting older.
My body's falling apart.

484
00:32:40,658 --> 00:32:43,127
I can't give up. Are you
kidding? If I give up,

485
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,563
if all those lives
that are depending on me

486
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:49,233
and the show
and my abil-- I mean,

487
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,636
the last thing
I can do is give up.

488
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:57,141
Just when my whole world
has like fallen apart

489
00:32:57,175 --> 00:32:59,177
and I think there's
no hope or something,

490
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,013
something swoops in
to save me at the last second.

491
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:04,749
Time will solve it.

492
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,751
At some point,
the answer will come

493
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:09,787
and, and I'll
move forward at that point.

494
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:19,097
[street party sounds]

495
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:29,841
Somebody just put a post
on my Facebook page

496
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,576
saying that we made The Soup,

497
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,212
and I didn't know
what The Soup was, so.

498
00:33:34,245 --> 00:33:36,581
But she knew,
so she was like: "Oh my God!"

499
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,851
-Comedy Central.
-Comedy Central. So--

500

00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,099
I cried every day
after Pinky died.

666
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,338
I put her to sleep and I could
barely hold it together.

667
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,175
She was my favorite cat.
I was her human.

668
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,977
Like she loved me the best.

669
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,182
All the other cats,
they don't love me the best.

670
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:30,801
-[animal-carer] She doesn't want
the babies to grow up out there.
-Yeah.

671
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:33,804
The guy said: "I can't
take care of these."

672
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:35,739
He said: "Someone
put them in my mailbox."

673
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:40,110
And I open the box and here's
these three little faces

674
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:42,312
like baby birds
looking up at me.

675
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:43,413
[Samantha] Aw.

676
00:49:44,781 --> 00:49:47,751
Thank goodness you
found them and it wasn't
too cold or anything.

677
00:49:47,784 --> 00:49:50,387
How could you put
a little animal in a box

678
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,522
and just hope someone
else deals with it?

679
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:54,024
[Samantha] I'll take them all.

680
00:49:55,225 --> 00:49:57,561
[Samantha] With cats, they don't
have the same kind of love

681
00:49:57,594 --> 00:50:00,263
as a human love.

682
00:50:00,297 --> 00:50:03,633
You know, there's nothing
more comforting than like,
just lying on the couch

683
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:09,206
watching TV and, you know, just
having a cat curled up here,

684
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,141
you know,
and a cat curled up here,

685
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:15,846
and then, you know,
just like Oz hugs you and,

686
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,648
you know, animals are healing.

687
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,851
They give you a reason
to get out of bed

688
00:50:20,884 --> 00:50:24,187
in, on a day that you might
not want to get out of bed.

689
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,825
They, they love you
unconditionally.

690
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:32,562
[Samantha]
They don't care if you're
wearing makeup or not, you know.

691
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:35,265
The love is genuine.

692
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:38,568
[gentle music]

693
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:46,643
It was a tough year, last year.
An awful year.

694
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,880
Because I missed
my parents a lot more
than I thought I would.

695
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,416
I no longer have that
like, validation that, like,

696
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,584
somebody that's proud,
is proud of me.

697
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:58,288
So that kind of uh, yeah
that affects me a lot more
than I thought.

698
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,627
I was at a crossroads of like
maybe I should just quit.

699
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,595
I had a crappy assistant.

700
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,532
I was just like miserable
on so many levels

701
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,168
that I was like,
why should I even bother?

702
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:18,442
I need a newer model of vehicle.
There was a hole in the floor
and the ceiling was caving in.

703
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,377
That's when we did
the Kickstarter.

704
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:25,215
[Samantha]
Hello! I'm Tuna from
Tuna and the Rock Cats.

705
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,652
[groovy music]]

706
00:51:32,823 --> 00:51:35,659
So the Kickstarter kind of
brought me back to life.

707
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,427
A lot of people mentioned it
on their blog,

708
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:40,764
and we have a PayPal button,
a donate button.

709
00:51:40,797 --> 00:51:42,766
Quite a few fans
actually donated.

710
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,669
Because we had all the support,
all this money that came in.

711
00:51:45,702 --> 00:51:48,305
We were able to buy
the Cat Bus, which is great!

712
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,841
Look I mean,
it's an amazing looking bus.

713
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,778
Fans of the cats,
fans from all over the country

714
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:57,714
really kind of kept me going
because they came together

715
00:51:57,747 --> 00:51:59,883
and came up with
this large sum of money.

716
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,685
Over $30,000.

717
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,324
Jax, Buggles, Tuna, and Dakota.

718
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,630
Ta-da! This is
the new Kitty City.

719
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,599
It's kind of
like a studio apartment.

720
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,802
We have this kitchen area here
where we have all the amenities.

721
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,772
We have a sink, stove,

722
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,275
uh oven,

723
00:52:26,343 --> 00:52:29,312
microwave, and a pretty
full size refrigerator.

724
00:52:30,247 --> 00:52:33,450
These are the condos.
The ones that don't get along
with the other cats,

725
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,585
don't want to live
with the commoners.

726
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,558
They really do have
the best digs in the house.

727
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,002
Welcome to the show!

728
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,271
[applause]

729
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,474
My name is Samantha.

730
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,844
And this is Christine.

731
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:01,912
Thank you.

732
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,282
Now, since April of 2009,

733
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:09,252
I've fostered and found homes
for 113 cats and kittens.

734
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,822
But the other reason
I put the show together

735
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,991
was to inspire people
to train their own cats

736
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:18,495
because you can train your cat
to do everything
you see our cats do.

737
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:21,898
[audience laughs]

738
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:28,905
It was amazing,
and you could tell that they
really cared about the cats.

739
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,541
-It was cat-tastic!
-It was cat-tastic.

740
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:33,877
People think cats can't
do that sort of stuff,

741
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,913
and it's just fun to, like,
actually see them perform stuff.

742
00:53:39,416 --> 00:53:45,021
[Samantha]
People are just now
starting to really see that
their-- that cats are capable.

743
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:47,991
The cat-cafes are
opening up everywhere.

744
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,459
You know, it's the right time.

745
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:52,262
Cats are a good
investment right now.

746
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:57,734
I can't imagine anything
stopping me, really.

747
00:53:57,767 --> 00:54:01,371
It's like a good time
to be a cat trainer.

748
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,307
No matter what terrible
thing has happened,

749
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,710
something good has
ended up coming out of it.

750
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,348
But I will say that I am single.

751
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,551
And I will probably
stay that way.

752
00:54:16,386 --> 00:54:17,754
[Christine] Welcome to the show!

753
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,592
[Samantha]
I have a million
goals in life, really.

754
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:24,527
There's so much
that I still want to do.

755
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,897
I mean, I'm not done yet.

756
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,935
Please welcome
Samantha and the Acrocats!

757
00:54:39,709 --> 00:54:42,846
[Stephen Colbert]
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment
you've all been waiting for--

758
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,914
the Acrocats.

759
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,637
Samantha Martin
and the amazing Acrocats!

760
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,082
[Samantha]
This show is about my life

761
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,618
and what my life
is with these cats

762
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,120
and what their personalities are
and where they came from

763
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,822
and my relationship with them.

764
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,992
I'm the only one
that can do the show.

765
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,527
No one else.

766
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,762
Because it's my story.

767
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,964
[theme music]
