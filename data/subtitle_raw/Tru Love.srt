Synch.   = B----k =

00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:54,199
No. N-n-n-no. I'm late.

3
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,600
I gotta fly.

4
00:01:55,601 --> 00:02:01,607
Don't go. Stay.

5
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,611
I can't.

6
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:06,614
I had a great time though Jenny.

7
00:02:06,615 --> 00:02:10,622
Jenny? It's Jaimie.

8
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:26,683
Mrs. Beacon?

9
00:03:26,684 --> 00:03:29,687
Um. Please. Call me Alice.

10

Yes. Of course.

13
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:39,700
Suzanne's mentioned you.

14
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:42,638
You're the lesbian.

15
00:03:42,705 --> 00:03:46,709
We're a bit of an endangered species.

16
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,714
Well that's a shame.

17
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:52,283
Suzanne had a. A meeting
she couldn't cancel. so.

18
00:03:52,284 --> 00:03:54,719
Yes of course. A meeting.

19
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,426
Well it was very kind of
you. Tru. To of let me in.

Um. I'm happy to help. Can
I take your bag? Upstairs?

21
00:04:02,497 --> 00:04:04,432
Well. You know. ?fyou wouldn't mind.

22
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,702
It's the top floor.

23
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:07,703
Suzanne's bedroom?

24
00:04:07,704 --> 00:04:09,705
She insists on keeping me
in the attic when I'm here.

25
00:04:09,706 --> 00:04:13,712
It's. Um. Further away.

26
00:04:34,538 --> 00:04:37,241
How did you and Suzanne meet?

27
00:04:37,242 --> 00:04:40,714
Through Gray. My best friend.

28
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:46,720
How well do you know her?

29
00:04:46,721 --> 00:04:49,724
Well. We met a few years ago.

30
00:04:49,725 --> 00:04:51,459
She's great.

31
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,562
We hit it om right away.

32
00:04:53,563 --> 00:04:57,268
Do you know if. ?f she's seeing anyone?

33
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:00,738
Not that I'm aware of.

34
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:03,242
Yeah. No. I dunno.

35
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:06,745
I'm sorry. No. I don't mean
to put you on the spot.

36
00:05:06,746 --> 00:05:09,750
The reason I'm asking is...

37
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,725
May I confide in you?

38
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,863
Sure.

39
00:05:22,466 --> 00:05:25,737
I do-I'm. I'm worried about her.

40
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:26,737
You know.

41
00:05:26,738 --> 00:05:28,740
She hasn't been home since her
father died in the Spring.

42
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,742
Right.

43
00:05:30,743 --> 00:05:33,746
And... And they were... they were close.

44
00:05:33,747 --> 00:05:36,751
She took it very hard.

45
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,685
Right.

46
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,756
And ya' know. I've tried calling but...

47
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:45,761
Well. She's always too busy
to talk to me. Of course.

48
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,497
She has been super busy lately.

49
00:05:47,498 --> 00:05:49,766
I mean l. I barely see her myself.

50
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:54,709
Yes but... Do you think she's alright?

51
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,775
I know. Yep. I know.

52
00:05:56,776 --> 00:05:58,778
Very last minute...

53
00:05:58,779 --> 00:05:59,846
Yes.

54
00:05:59,847 --> 00:06:03,784
I know.ju-Yep. I know. Just.

55
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:04,786
Call me right back. Okay?

56
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:06,788
Darling.

57
00:06:06,789 --> 00:06:10,793
Mother. I'm so sorry I'm late.
I was prepping.

58
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:11,361
Hey.

59
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:12,563
Hi. Thank you for helping.

60
00:06:12,564 --> 00:06:13,797
Tru. I'm sorry it was so last minute.

61
00:06:13,798 --> 00:06:14,798
No.

62
00:06:14,799 --> 00:06:17,936
What or whom are you prepping?

63
00:06:17,937 --> 00:06:18,838
Very passionate on the phone just now.

64
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,806
A new paramour perhaps?

65
00:06:20,807 --> 00:06:22,808
What? No!

66
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:23,810
Well! Can't be all work dear.

67
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,811
Mother.

68
00:06:24,812 --> 00:06:25,780
Well how am I supposed
to know if I don't ask?

69
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:26,781
You never tell me anything.

70
00:06:26,782 --> 00:06:27,782
And you wonder why.

71
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:28,783
Yes I do.

72
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:30,786
My daughter is very secretive.

73
00:06:30,787 --> 00:06:34,359
My mother is very intrusive.

74
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,493
Alright.

75
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:39,532
I am going to get changed for dinner.

76
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,501
Excuse me.

77
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:47,542
Well that's her.

78
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:47,808
Wow.

79
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:49,810
Yeah. Tell me about it.

80
00:06:49,811 --> 00:06:51,813
She called last minute
to say she was coming.

81
00:06:51,814 --> 00:06:53,983
Like I have time right now.

82
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:55,818
Yeah thank God you still
have that spare key.

83
00:06:55,819 --> 00:06:58,656
Yeah. It's no problem.

84
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:02,661
It's really great to see you again.

85
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:05,530
Are you umm. Are you still
at that. Cafe? On King St?

86
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:09,802
The. Umm... The Green Apple?

87
00:07:09,803 --> 00:07:10,803
The Blue Pear.

88
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:14,675
No I No I quit a couple
of months ago and...

89
00:07:14,676 --> 00:07:15,877
You go through jobs like you do women.

90
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,813
That is not true...

91
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,817
Myjobs last longer.

92
00:07:21,985 --> 00:07:24,821
Alright. We ready?

93
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:25,822
No! No.

94
00:07:25,823 --> 00:07:28,926
Just. Um. Give me a minute to. Change.

95
00:07:29,828 --> 00:07:31,830
Well.

96
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:33,833
?t was lovely to meet you.

97
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:36,836
Pleasure was all mine but this
can't be goodbye so soon.

98
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:37,905
Why don't you come to dinner with us?

99
00:07:37,906 --> 00:07:39,807
I insist.

100
00:07:39,808 --> 00:07:40,809
No. L. l. I don't want to intrude.

101
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,811
No you are not intruding.

102
00:07:42,812 --> 00:07:43,812
I would love to have you.

103
00:07:43,813 --> 00:07:46,817
Dammit.

104
00:07:46,817 --> 00:07:48,986
I am so sorry Mother there
has been an injunction.

105
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:49,820
I have to

106
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:51,790
Make partner. Yes I know.

107
00:07:51,791 --> 00:07:53,825
You are so like your father.

108
00:07:53,826 --> 00:07:55,661
Work. Work. Work.

109
00:07:55,662 --> 00:07:58,833
And it killed him in the end. Y'know?

110
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,903
Yes. Thank you for the reminder.

111
00:08:01,904 --> 00:08:03,839
Well.

112
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,973
Perhaps I could take you to dinner Tru?

113
00:08:04,974 --> 00:08:07,843
It's the least I could
do for rescuing me...

114
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:09,846
from a locked door.

115
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:12,850
I'd have to make a quick call.

116
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,552
Alright.

117
00:08:14,553 --> 00:08:15,820
If it's OK with you. That is?

118
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,823
Of course it's OK.

119
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:20,929
L. I will make this up to you. I promise.

120
00:08:21,829 --> 00:08:23,830
OK. And um.

121
00:08:23,832 --> 00:08:25,833
And we'll. Catch up?

122
00:08:25,834 --> 00:08:26,834
Yeah. I'd love that.

123
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:27,836
OK.

124
00:08:27,837 --> 00:08:29,938
Here you go. Omyou go.

125
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,917
My daughter's embarrassed by me.

126
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,588
I'm sure she isn't. Alice.

127
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,860
She is. She always has been but it's...

128
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,728
it's worse now that her fathers gone.

129
00:08:47,729 --> 00:08:50,882
He was the glue that
held us together and...

130
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,069
look. I'm sorry. There I go again.

131
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,872
It's fine. Alice.

132
00:08:55,873 --> 00:08:57,874
I understand.

133
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:58,875
Tru-licious.

134
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:01,879
Hey! What are you doing here?

135
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,881
I have a date.

136
00:09:02,882 --> 00:09:03,882
Another one?

137
00:09:03,883 --> 00:09:04,883
Hello!

138
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:06,018
I'm. Grahm.

139
00:09:06,019 --> 00:09:08,020
But my dearest friends call me Grae.

140
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:09,890
At least to my face.

141
00:09:09,891 --> 00:09:10,891
Lord knows what they
call me behind my back.

142
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:11,892
And you are?

143
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:13,894
I'm Alice.

144
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:14,896
Suzanne's mother.

145
00:09:14,897 --> 00:09:15,897
Impossible.

146
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:19,902
You're far to young and. My. Gorgeous.

147
00:09:19,903 --> 00:09:21,605
Suzanne must have mentioned me.

148
00:09:21,606 --> 00:09:22,906
Of course Gray.

149
00:09:22,907 --> 00:09:23,607
Enchanted.

150
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,910
Suzanne has exquisite taste in friends.

151
00:09:25,911 --> 00:09:28,915
Oooh! I like you Alice.

152
00:09:29,882 --> 00:09:30,882
Alright. I'm starving.

153
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:31,617
Gotta order something.

154
00:09:31,618 --> 00:09:33,887
What do you recommend?

155
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,890
Gray recommends the chicken.

156
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:37,891
Don't you. Gray?

157
00:09:37,892 --> 00:09:38,893
Do you?

158
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:42,631
L. Do. Delicious.

159
00:09:42,632 --> 00:09:44,900
Love knows no age or bounds.

160
00:09:44,901 --> 00:09:46,904
Does it. Alice?

161
00:09:46,904 --> 00:09:48,940
Y'know. I don't suppose that it does.

162
00:09:48,941 --> 00:09:51,075
There. You see. Alice agrees.

163
00:09:51,076 --> 00:09:52,911
Agrees with what?

164
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:53,912
Never you mind.

165
00:09:53,913 --> 00:09:56,917
My very handsome date has arrived.

166
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:57,818

Lovely to meet you ladies.

170
00:10:03,926 --> 00:10:07,078
If you enchanting creatures
would excuse us.

171
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,699
Have fun.

172
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,902
Would you like to get a table?

173
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,904
Sure. Yeah.

174
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:14,906
Jenna?

175
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,109
Can we get a table in the back please?

176
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:20,913
Can I askyou a direct question?

177
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:21,915
Fire away.

178
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:22,916
I don't want to be intrusive.

179
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:25,921
I don't mind.

180
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:30,928
Have you always known that you were...

181
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:34,264
A lesbian?

182
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,934
Yes.

183
00:10:36,935 --> 00:10:37,935
Well. No.

184
00:10:37,936 --> 00:10:42,275
I tried dating guys when I was younger.

185
00:10:42,276 --> 00:10:45,781
Wasn't my thing.

186
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:47,915
But don't you... don't you miss...

187
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,084
Men. Y'know...

188
00:10:50,085 --> 00:10:51,920
sex I mean.

189
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:55,794
That's a deeply penetrating question.

190
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:56,927
No.

191
00:10:56,928 --> 00:10:58,929
Sex with women...

192
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,934
is hot

193
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,936
Is it?

194
00:11:04,938 --> 00:11:07,106
My turn.

195
00:11:08,943 --> 00:11:10,944
OK.

196
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:12,947
Why did you get married. Alice?

197
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:14,950
Well.

198
00:11:14,951 --> 00:11:17,953
Y'know it was a dimerent time and

199
00:11:17,954 --> 00:11:22,094
I needed to escape my circumstances.

200
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,929
I mean it was either
that orjoin a nunnery.

201
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:27,934
You couldn't be a lesbian.

202
00:11:27,934 --> 00:11:30,938
You could if you joined a nunnery.

203
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,952
You enjoy life. Don't you?

204
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:43,954
I have my moments.

205
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:44,955
Hearts broke?

206
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:46,958
Oooooh.

207
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,328
More than once.

208
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:51,964
I'm very good at starting relationships.

209
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:54,033
It's the

210
00:11:54,034 --> 00:11:56,970
middle and end parts I tend to fuck up.

211
00:11:56,971 --> 00:11:58,171
Pardon my language.

212
00:11:58,172 --> 00:12:02,978
Pardon my "fucking" language.

213
00:12:02,979 --> 00:12:04,914
Case in point.

214
00:12:04,915 --> 00:12:07,350
Claire.

215
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:10,988
Ouch.

216
00:12:10,989 --> 00:12:12,991
It seems I have poor boundaries

217
00:12:12,992 --> 00:12:15,995
and I'm not equipped for
healthy relationships.

218
00:12:15,996 --> 00:12:16,996
At least that's what my

219
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:21,001
fabulously hot therapist tells me.

220
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:23,004
To lesbian love.

221
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:25,006
A blood sport.

222
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:29,012
Have you slept with a lot of lesbians?

223
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,848
Well. Most of the women
that I slept with are...

224
00:12:31,849 --> 00:12:34,985
in fact. Card carrying lesbians.

225
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,187
But not all.

226
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:40,862
Confused women like to sleep with me too.

227
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,997
Are you alright Alice?

228
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:44,998
Yes. I am.

229
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:45,999
I'm fine.

230
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,870
Lfyou'll just excuse me for one moment.

231
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:51,005
I'm going to visit the ladies.

232
00:12:51,006 --> 00:12:54,010
Excuse me.

233
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,963
Can I get you guys anything else?

234
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,163
No.l thinkwe're good. Angie.

235
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,999
Just the bill.

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,002
OK.

237
00:13:19,176 --> 00:13:21,011
The Pussy Whisperer?

238
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,013
What?

239
00:13:23,014 --> 00:13:25,016
She's a bit of a legend.

240
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:28,020
Do you prefer younger or older women?

241
00:13:28,021 --> 00:13:30,958
Both.

242
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:43,039
Hey!

243
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,373
Hi!

244
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:44,374
I'm sorry about that.

245
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,042
How did it go?

246
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:46,043
Good.

247
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,244
She's great.

248
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,014
So much fun.

249
00:13:49,015 --> 00:13:51,016
Well. That's mostly bravado.

250
00:13:51,017 --> 00:13:52,384
What do you mean?

251
00:13:52,385 --> 00:13:55,957
Underneath she's a bit of a mess.

252
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:58,025
Y'know since my dad died

253
00:13:58,026 --> 00:13:59,027
it's been rough.

254
00:13:59,028 --> 00:14:00,028
Right.

255
00:14:00,029 --> 00:14:05,004
Yeah. Of course. For both of you.

256
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:08,038
She must be lonely.

257
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,039
No. She's not lonely.

258
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,274
She has me.

259
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:12,043
Of course she does.

260
00:14:12,044 --> 00:14:13,044
Well look.

261
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:14,046
I was I was happy to help out.

262
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:16,048
It was really good of you
Tru. Thank you again.

263
00:14:16,049 --> 00:14:17,050
Yup.

264
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,417
We should hook up for comee soon.

265
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:20,053
Yeah. I would love that.

266
00:14:20,054 --> 00:14:21,055
Yeah?

267
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:22,990
Maybe in a week or so
when I'm done this case

268
00:14:22,991 --> 00:14:24,025
and you can give me more umm.

269
00:14:24,026 --> 00:14:26,027
101 tips on "How to Love
'em and Leave 'em_'"

270
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:28,029
I wrote the book.

271
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:28,430
I Yeah well

272
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,032
men are such bastards.

273
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,035
You're lucky you're a lesbian.

274
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,036
Right.

275
00:14:33,037 --> 00:14:36,008
'Cause women are so much easier.

276
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,042
Ok. I should go.

277
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,044
I'm seeing her tomorrow.

278
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,045
Who?

279
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,015
Alice.

280
00:14:42,016 --> 00:14:43,049
My Mother? Really? Why?

281
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,018
For a walk.

282
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,053
Don't feel obligated.

283
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:49,124
No I don't. L. Want to.

284
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,994
If that's OK with you? Is it?

285
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:53,062
Yeah. No. Yeah of course. That's OK.

286
00:14:53,063 --> 00:14:56,066
Alright. Well good. Get inside.

287
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,067
OK.

288
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:58,769
See yah.

289
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,076
She's...

290
00:15:04,077 --> 00:15:06,613
She's really lovely.

291
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,315
Nice.

292
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,087
I've been invited to go for
a walkwith her tomorrow.

293
00:15:13,088 --> 00:15:15,090
Do you mind?

294
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:18,094
Suzanne?

295
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:19,095
Sorry?

296
00:15:19,096 --> 00:15:20,096
Tomorrow afternoon?

297
00:15:20,097 --> 00:15:22,099
A date with Tru.

298
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,302
Do you mind. Terribly?

299
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:27,106
She seems lonely.

300
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,111
That's fine.

301
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:34,114
I'm... I'm super busy. Anyway.

302
00:15:34,115 --> 00:15:36,117
Um.

303
00:15:36,118 --> 00:15:39,088
?n fact. I'm a bit behind
and I have some work to do.

304
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,090
If you don't mind. Mother?

305
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,091
No. Of course.

306
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:45,096
Sweetheart of course not. Of course not.

307
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,106
Work. Work. Work. It always comes first.

308
00:15:53,107 --> 00:15:55,677
Goodnight.

309
00:16:07,124 --> 00:16:10,128
What a day I've had.

310
00:16:12,131 --> 00:16:15,101
You certainly have.

311
00:16:16,103 --> 00:16:19,107
Hanging out with the sophists.

312
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:24,114
Don't you feel like a dark horse?

313
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:27,117
The "pussy whisperer_'"

314
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:34,726
Why didn't you tell her the whole story?

315
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,728
Young.

316
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,730
Knocked up.

317
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:41,203
Shotgun wedding.

318
00:16:41,736 --> 00:16:44,739
The nunnery.

319
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:24,791
Claire.

320
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:29,364
Well you looked really peaceful just now.

321
00:17:29,796 --> 00:17:31,798
Did you sleep well?

322
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,535
'Cause. You know. I didn't.

323
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:36,371
I didn't really sleep well last night

324
00:17:36,372 --> 00:17:39,808
or all week for that matter.

325
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,809
I'm sorry.

326
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,812
Something came up last night.

327
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:44,748
Yeah.

328
00:17:44,749 --> 00:17:47,219
And something occurred to me last night.

329
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,221
That you've been playing me.

330
00:17:49,222 --> 00:17:49,821
Claire...

331
00:17:49,822 --> 00:17:50,822
No. Here's...

332
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:52,825
here's your key.

333
00:17:52,826 --> 00:17:55,829
I could've given it to you last
night but you bailed on me.

334
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,830
Again.

335
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:59,667
I sent you a text.

336
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:01,836
I had to go out with Suzanne's mother.

337
00:18:01,837 --> 00:18:03,305
Always an excuse.

338
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:04,807
She was alone and upset.

339
00:18:04,808 --> 00:18:05,808
What was I supposed to do?

340
00:18:05,809 --> 00:18:08,812
You were supposed to meet with me!

341
00:18:08,813 --> 00:18:10,815
I was alone and upset.

342
00:18:10,816 --> 00:18:14,820
I mean this isn't the first time. Tru.

343
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:17,824
We've been dating for months.

344
00:18:17,825 --> 00:18:18,825
We exchanged keys.

345
00:18:18,826 --> 00:18:20,828
We were falling in love.

346
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:21,829
Yeah I thought I was.

347
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:24,833
L. I don't know.

348
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,402
I'm just. I'm not...

349
00:18:26,403 --> 00:18:29,841
You're not what?

350
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:33,844
I'm not... ready...

351
00:18:33,845 --> 00:18:37,851
for a relationship.

352
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:41,755
Yeah.

353
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:43,824
And you never will be.

354
00:18:43,825 --> 00:18:45,827
And you know why?

355
00:18:45,828 --> 00:18:47,895
Because you don't give a damn

356
00:18:47,896 --> 00:18:50,833
about anyone or anything
other then yourself.

357
00:18:50,834 --> 00:18:54,838
You should really come
with a warning label. Tru.

358
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:55,839
Y'know and if...

359
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,842
if you didn't want to be with me.

360
00:18:57,843 --> 00:18:59,844
You could have at least had the courtesy

361
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:02,848
to say it to my face instead of
just hoping that I'd go away.

362
00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:05,853
Don't get up.

363
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,859
I can kick myself out the door.

364
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:24,843
Well it's just...

365
00:19:24,844 --> 00:19:27,848
it's beautiful.

366
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,856
You're very quiet today.

367
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:37,695
Am I?

368
00:19:37,861 --> 00:19:39,863
A little

369
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:42,867
mysterious.

370
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,805
No. I'm not.

371
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:48,707
What's on your mind?

372
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,879
There's nothing much to tell.

373
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:55,849
Tell me something. Anything.

374
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:58,854
I don't know much about you really.

375
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:02,858
Well. What do you wanna know?

376
00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:03,859
Where do you work.

377
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,862
Where do you live.

378
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:08,867
I live over there.

379
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:11,870
Across the water?

380
00:20:11,871 --> 00:20:13,672
Well...

381
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:16,610
how do you get there?

382
00:20:16,677 --> 00:20:21,752
That's all part of the
great mystery. Alice.

383
00:20:27,891 --> 00:20:28,891
God...

384
00:20:28,892 --> 00:20:31,629
now that is just sad.

385
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,898
Suzanne is very good at ordering in.

386
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,902
I seem to recall that.

387
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:39,640
_ww.

388
00:20:41,909 --> 00:20:44,912
I'm here to perform...

389
00:20:44,913 --> 00:20:46,914
a miracle.

390
00:20:47,917 --> 00:20:50,920
Where'd you learn to cook?

391
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:51,921
Paris.

392
00:20:51,922 --> 00:20:53,857
God. I love Paris.

393
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:54,691
Me too.

394
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:56,627
I'd love to go back.

395
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,931
You should go back.

396
00:20:58,931 --> 00:21:02,935
Y'know. I love French culture.

397
00:21:02,936 --> 00:21:06,942
They make art out of life.

398
00:21:08,844 --> 00:21:10,912
This is so good.

399
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:12,647
You should try my boef de le bolognesa

400
00:21:12,648 --> 00:21:14,917
with actual ingredients.

401
00:21:14,918 --> 00:21:15,685
Alright.

402
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:18,539
Then you will have to cook it for me.

403
00:21:18,923 --> 00:21:21,927
I will.

404
00:21:24,931 --> 00:21:25,964
Would you like to come to my place

405
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,934
tomorrow. Alice?

406
00:21:27,935 --> 00:21:30,938
In the afternoon ifyou're free?

407
00:21:30,939 --> 00:21:31,939
Yes.

408
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,074
Great.

409
00:21:33,075 --> 00:21:35,944
Um. I'll come by here at one to get you.

410
00:21:35,945 --> 00:21:37,780
K.

411
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:38,948
We have to take a fairy to get there.

412
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:41,117
So.

413
00:21:41,118 --> 00:21:44,655
They mystery's solved.

414
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:49,732
I'll teach you how to
make boef de la bolognesa.

415
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:52,933
And I'll teach you something.

416
00:21:52,934 --> 00:21:54,868
What?

417
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:57,940
It requires your body.

418
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:05,116
A la prochaine.

419
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,159
Dinner for two.

420
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,661
Very romantic.

421
00:22:15,662 --> 00:22:17,966
Very clandestine.

422
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:18,966
You know she's a lesbian.

423
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:20,935
Yes.

424
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:21,936
A young lesbian.

425
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:22,937
Yes.

426
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:24,039
And you are neither.

427
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,043
We did set a place for you

428
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:30,949
but you didn't call or show up.

429
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,951
Right.

430
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:34,953
I'm sorry.

431
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,955
I was working late. Again. And I forgot.

432
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:37,957
Tomorrow? K?

433
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:42,966
Let's have dinner tomorrow?

434
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:20,981
You ever think of me like that?

435
00:23:22,982 --> 00:23:25,985
Gave you everything you needed.

436
00:23:25,986 --> 00:23:29,992
It was never enough.

437
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:35,064
Be careful. Alice.

438
00:23:49,016 --> 00:23:50,016
Thank you for babysitting

439
00:23:50,017 --> 00:23:53,020
my mother that past couple days.

440
00:23:53,021 --> 00:23:54,955
Come on. No problem.

441
00:23:54,956 --> 00:23:56,757
I'm just so busy prepping
for this court case

442
00:23:56,758 --> 00:23:58,026
I'm not really around much.

443
00:23:58,027 --> 00:24:01,030
Well I've got a little
bit of time right now.

444
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:05,171
Well don't you always?

445
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:09,040
Wow... nice Suzanne.

446
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,808
Alright.

447
00:24:10,809 --> 00:24:11,009
Hi.

448
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,010
So. See you later.

449
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:14,013
OK

450
00:24:14,014 --> 00:24:14,781
See you around.

451
00:24:14,782 --> 00:24:17,017
Bye.

452
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:59,039
?t's gorgeous.

453
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:20,065
It's just lovely.

454
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:27,040
Just down here.

455
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,043
There aren't any cars.

456
00:25:29,044 --> 00:25:31,045
I know.

457
00:25:31,046 --> 00:25:34,017
Isn't it nice?

458
00:25:36,053 --> 00:25:39,157
This is where I live.

459
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:43,061
It's charming.

460
00:25:45,064 --> 00:25:47,066
It's incredible.

461
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:49,068
You know I never did climb it.

462
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:52,007
Well. You will.

463
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:55,077
I hope.

464
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:12,065
Is this you?

465
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:14,067
Yeah.

466
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:16,070
With your parents?

467
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:19,074
Yeah...

468
00:26:19,075 --> 00:26:21,076
Hmph.

469
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:24,080
Such kind faces.

470
00:26:24,081 --> 00:26:26,083
You can see how loved you are.

471
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,087
Where do they live?

472
00:26:33,092 --> 00:26:36,096
They don't.

473
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,040
Tru. I am so sorry.

474
00:26:43,105 --> 00:26:45,041
How?

475
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:49,045
They were trying to make
it home for my birthday.

476
00:26:49,046 --> 00:26:52,117
And they took a wrong turn.

477
00:26:54,486 --> 00:26:55,320
It's OK. Alice.

478
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:57,122
It was a long time ago.

479
00:26:57,123 --> 00:26:59,259
Nobody's fault.

480
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,130
I'm OK.

481
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:05,133
I just don't do birthday's...

482
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:08,137
or funerals.

483
00:27:09,139 --> 00:27:11,140
How old were you at the time?

484
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:13,143
Turning twelve.

485
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:15,111
So young.

486
00:27:15,112 --> 00:27:16,113
Yeah.

487
00:27:16,114 --> 00:27:19,116
Do you have brothers or sisters?

488
00:27:19,117 --> 00:27:21,119
No.

489
00:27:23,123 --> 00:27:25,124
So. Who raised you?

490
00:27:25,125 --> 00:27:27,127
My Aunt and Uncle.

491
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:30,130
Until I was fifteen.

492
00:27:30,131 --> 00:27:33,134
And what happened at fifteen?

493
00:27:33,135 --> 00:27:36,138
Well then l...

494
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:38,141
Do you really wanna talk about this?

495
00:27:38,142 --> 00:27:39,142
Because...

496
00:27:39,143 --> 00:27:40,143
you know.

497
00:27:40,144 --> 00:27:41,145
Shitjust happens.

498
00:27:41,146 --> 00:27:44,584
Yes I do.

499
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:48,154
I usually don't talk about it.

500
00:27:48,155 --> 00:27:49,155
Why?

501
00:27:49,156 --> 00:27:52,494
What happened at fifteen?

502
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:58,602
Umm

503
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:03,142
I got caught with a girl.

504
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:07,146
And so what did they do?

505
00:28:07,146 --> 00:28:09,147
Umm...

506
00:28:09,582 --> 00:28:14,320
they locked me in my room for weeks.

507
00:28:14,321 --> 00:28:17,158
I broke the window with my hand and...

508
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:20,296
I ran away.

509
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:26,169
Where to?

510
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,508
The streets. Shelters.

511
00:28:30,141 --> 00:28:33,146
A few nice people.

512
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:36,383
I survived.

513
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:40,322
You more than survived.

514
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:56,174
You ever smoked pot. Alice?

515
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:56,541
Once.

516
00:28:56,542 --> 00:29:01,180
A long time ago.

517
00:29:01,181 --> 00:29:04,184
It gets me in the mood.

518
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:07,156
For what?

519
00:29:07,689 --> 00:29:09,157
Cooking.

520
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:14,568
Cooking!

521
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,170
So...

522
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:22,576
So what is this?

523
00:29:24,177 --> 00:29:25,178
A double helix.

524
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:29,183
A snake shedding it's skin.

525
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:32,187
I was twenty-one.

526
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,193
Wine?

527
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:40,432
OK.

528
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:45,203
You sure that you should be

529
00:29:45,204 --> 00:29:48,609
using a knife in your condition?

530
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:53,417
I could do this in my sleep.

531
00:29:55,217 --> 00:29:58,220
Onions.

532
00:29:58,221 --> 00:30:03,226
I umm. I rub them in my eyes sometimes.

533
00:30:03,227 --> 00:30:06,231
Why?

534
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:07,232
They help me cry.

535
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:10,236
It's my therapy.

536
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:14,240
I umm...

537
00:30:14,241 --> 00:30:16,276
I wasn't allowed to cry after the funeral.

538
00:30:16,277 --> 00:30:19,647
They gave me a few days and then...

539
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,782
told me to "stop_'"

540
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:23,219
To give my sumering over to Jesus.

541
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,286
No.

542
00:30:24,287 --> 00:30:26,656
Yeah. And then...

543
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,727
and then I just forgot how.

544
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,231
Y'know people have always accuse me

545
00:30:32,232 --> 00:30:35,235
of not caring.

546
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,237
That is not true.

547
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:39,239
I care deeply...

548
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,243
about onions.

549
00:30:42,244 --> 00:30:43,245
Tru.

550
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:46,248
That's sad.

551
00:30:46,249 --> 00:30:52,728
That is so sad.

552
00:31:13,251 --> 00:31:13,850
Look.

553
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:14,851
Look.

554
00:31:14,852 --> 00:31:16,854
Look at that cloud.

555
00:31:16,855 --> 00:31:17,589
Where?

556
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,856
Look. Do you see it?

557
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:19,857
No.

558
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:20,859
It looks like a snake.

559
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,861
It looks just like your tattoo.

560
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:24,864
There. Right up there. Look.

561
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:27,336
There.

562
00:31:28,336 --> 00:31:29,870
Do you see it?

563
00:31:29,871 --> 00:31:32,408
No.

564
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:36,882
You're blind.

565
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,642
Wow! My God!

566
00:32:01,912 --> 00:32:02,913
So...

567
00:32:02,914 --> 00:32:05,718
Tru.

568
00:32:05,917 --> 00:32:08,922
Is that short for Trudy?

569
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:11,924
Fantastic.

570
00:32:11,925 --> 00:32:14,862
Thank you.

571
00:32:14,863 --> 00:32:17,666
Umm...

572
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:18,933
Gertrude.

573
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:20,936
No.

574
00:32:20,937 --> 00:32:23,941
Please don't tell anyone.

575
00:32:24,942 --> 00:32:25,942
Gertrude?

576
00:32:25,943 --> 00:32:28,948
Yeah. Thanks Mom and Dad.

577
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:35,656
Gertrude and Alice.

578
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:38,960
Paris.

579
00:32:50,942 --> 00:32:52,944
Just in case you think I've forgotten.

580
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:55,947
I'm going to teach you something.

581
00:32:55,948 --> 00:32:56,949
What?

582
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,951
The Tango.

583
00:32:58,952 --> 00:32:59,953
Here?

584
00:32:59,954 --> 00:33:00,954
Now?

585
00:33:00,955 --> 00:33:01,955
Here and now.

586
00:33:01,956 --> 00:33:02,956
OK?

587
00:33:02,957 --> 00:33:03,958
OK.

588
00:33:03,959 --> 00:33:05,693
OK. So you put your hand there

589
00:33:05,694 --> 00:33:07,963
and mine goes there.

590
00:33:07,964 --> 00:33:08,964
You turn your back

591
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:09,965
and you follow me. Ready?

592
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:10,967
And

593
00:33:10,968 --> 00:33:12,969
one, two,

594
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,972
. one. Two. Three. Four

595
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,974
step and turn. Step behind. Glide. Snap.

596
00:33:16,975 --> 00:33:18,977
And..

597
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:23,953
Tango Music

598
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,962
Goodnight Alice.

599
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,965
Goodnight Tru.

600
00:34:00,966 --> 00:34:03,968
And. I had a lovely evening.

601
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:04,535
So did l.

602
00:34:04,536 --> 00:34:05,971
Did you? Did you really?

603
00:34:05,972 --> 00:34:08,976
Yes.

604
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,980
You know I feel so

605
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:15,985
alive with you.

606
00:34:20,991 --> 00:34:23,994
Did you two have fun?

607
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:24,995
Yes. Yes we did.

608
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,998
We went to Tru's house on the island.

609
00:34:26,999 --> 00:34:30,002
And we dined. And we played outside.

610
00:34:30,003 --> 00:34:33,006
We watched clouds...

611
00:34:33,007 --> 00:34:34,974
and we danced.

612
00:34:34,975 --> 00:34:35,975
It's almost midnight.

613
00:34:35,976 --> 00:34:36,977
Kinda late.

614
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:38,979
I forgot about the time.

615
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,713
Obviously.

616
00:34:39,714 --> 00:34:39,981
You missed dinner.

617
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:41,983
We had plans.

618
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:42,984
We did?

619
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,987
I completely forgot.

620
00:34:44,988 --> 00:34:45,988
I'm so sorry. Darling.

621
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:48,993
Will you forgive me?

622
00:34:49,994 --> 00:34:51,996
Are you drunk?

623
00:34:51,997 --> 00:34:53,998
No!

624
00:34:53,999 --> 00:35:00,999
No... no. I am intoxicated with life.

625
00:35:01,008 --> 00:35:02,743
I should go.

626
00:35:02,744 --> 00:35:05,013
I'm sorry if I caused any trouble. Suzanne.

627
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,748
I didn't know you had dinner plans.

628
00:35:06,749 --> 00:35:08,952
Of course you didn't know.

629
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:10,019
You have your father's temperament.

630
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,020
Especially under stress

631
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:17,032
and it is not an attractive quality.

632
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:28,877
See you tomorrow?

633
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:33,048
If Suzanne doesn't mind.

634
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:36,087
Suzanne is not my mother.

635
00:35:39,057 --> 00:35:42,061
Tomorrow.

636
00:36:08,061 --> 00:36:10,229
Did you have to be so diMcult?

637
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:13,067
Playing outside?

638
00:36:13,068 --> 00:36:14,101
Really Mother?

639
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:17,072
And dancing?

640
00:36:17,073 --> 00:36:19,775
If I didn't know better I'd say
you were attracted to her.

641
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:23,079
If I didn't know better
I'd say you're jealous.

642
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,049
Ofwhat?

643
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,052
I'm not sure.

644
00:36:27,053 --> 00:36:29,054
You tell me.

645
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,081
Stubborn.

646
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,082
Sarcastic.

647
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,084
Impossible.

648
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:55,087
You taught her well.

649
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:57,090
That's right. Alice.

650
00:36:57,091 --> 00:36:59,093
It's all my fault.

651
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:04,065
I've never had anything that wasn't
mine. Anything that wasn't ruined.

652
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:05,066
Ruined?

653
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:09,073
You didn't need any of my help with that.

654
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:13,076
God. You were such a heartless bastard.

655
00:37:13,077 --> 00:37:16,814
I thought that's what you wanted.

656
00:37:16,815 --> 00:37:18,083
I could have saved you a lot of trouble

657
00:37:18,084 --> 00:37:19,251
if I'd just dumped you at the door.

658
00:37:19,252 --> 00:37:22,088
God forbid that Alice should have any fun.

659
00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:23,156
That would be too embarrassing.

660
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,093
God damn it Alice!

661
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:29,098
You don't know when to stop.

662
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:34,106
Now that wasn't necessary.

663
00:37:52,094 --> 00:37:53,195
Suzanne?

664
00:37:53,196 --> 00:37:55,097
You're home.

665
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,099
Yeah.

666
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
Um. Alice. ?s sick.

667
00:37:57,101 --> 00:38:01,074
I have to stay home and take care of her.

668
00:38:01,106 --> 00:38:02,840
Will she be alright?

669
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:04,109
Yup. Hopefully.

670
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,243
But she's too old to be playing outside.

671
00:38:05,244 --> 00:38:07,346
She caught a cold.

672
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:09,982
You're mad at me.

673
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:12,119
Is Alice really sick or

674
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,123
is there something else going on here?

675
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:16,124
I don't know what you mean.

676
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:17,125
My Mother is sick.

677
00:38:17,126 --> 00:38:18,127
I have to go.

678
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:21,864
Why are you being like this?

679
00:38:21,865 --> 00:38:23,133
Is it about the other thing

680
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,069
because I thought we talked about that.

681
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,137
OK. I can't talk right now I have to go.

682
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,138
OK.

683
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:30,142
I am leaving.

684
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:31,277
Please just tell her that I came

685
00:38:31,278 --> 00:38:35,083
because she's expecting me.

686
00:38:35,149 --> 00:38:37,185
Thanks.

687
00:40:10,037 --> 00:40:12,173
Mother?

688
00:40:12,174 --> 00:40:15,177
Hello dear.

689
00:40:15,178 --> 00:40:17,145
Did you go out?

690
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,182
No.

691
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:22,186
Are you going out?

692
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:25,189
I was expecting

693
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,193
I was expecting Tru. But...

694
00:40:28,194 --> 00:40:32,198
I didn't... she didn't show up. so.

695
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,203
Um.

696
00:40:35,203 --> 00:40:36,203
Well. We could go out.

697
00:40:36,204 --> 00:40:39,576
We could get dinner.

698
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:44,181
I think um...

699
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:52,190
I think maybe I'll just um...

700
00:40:52,191 --> 00:40:55,195
retire early.

701
00:41:00,268 --> 00:41:02,203
Goodnight darling.

702
00:41:02,204 --> 00:41:04,206
Goodnight.

703
00:41:42,255 --> 00:41:43,255
Hi.

704
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:46,259
My mother still isn't well.

705
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:49,263
I know. That's why I made her soup.

706
00:41:49,264 --> 00:41:51,467
What are you playing at?

707
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,268
I don't know what you mean.

708
00:41:53,269 --> 00:41:54,269
My mother is easily influenced.

709
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,240
She has been very fragile
since my dad died.

710
00:41:57,241 --> 00:41:58,241
Someone's fragile.

711
00:41:58,242 --> 00:42:00,244
I saw you kiss her!

712
00:42:00,245 --> 00:42:01,245
In my hallway!

713
00:42:01,246 --> 00:42:03,248
That's what this is about?

714
00:42:03,249 --> 00:42:05,250
She kissed me... for your information.

715
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:07,253
On the cheek.

716
00:42:07,254 --> 00:42:09,255
I know what you're like.

717
00:42:09,256 --> 00:42:10,257
What am I like?

718
00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:11,291
You know what will happen!

719
00:42:11,292 --> 00:42:13,261
No! I don't know!

720
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:15,196
She can't see you.

721
00:42:15,197 --> 00:42:18,269
Did she tell you that?

722
00:42:21,106 --> 00:42:24,275
Give her this. Please.

723
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:27,279
Mother fucker!

724
00:42:58,286 --> 00:43:03,292
DOORBELL

725
00:43:03,293 --> 00:43:08,301
KNOCKING

726
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:39,675
Mother?

727
00:43:45,312 --> 00:43:47,683
Mom?

728
00:44:05,305 --> 00:44:09,311
Where have you been? Mother?

729
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:17,820
I don't know... just...

730
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,322
walking.

731
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,326
I was worried about you.

732
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,328
Sorry.

733
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:28,335
I lost track of the time.

734
00:44:29,703 --> 00:44:33,543
OK. Well. You're here now.

735
00:44:33,842 --> 00:44:35,342
Um. L. Bought some dinner.

736
00:44:35,343 --> 00:44:38,347
You. Hungry?

737
00:44:43,354 --> 00:44:45,355
Good god girl. What'd you expect?

738
00:44:45,356 --> 00:44:49,360
I didn't expect anything from Alice.

739
00:44:49,361 --> 00:44:50,362
She's so...

740
00:44:50,363 --> 00:44:52,364
Old.

741
00:44:52,365 --> 00:44:55,368
No Gray. She's incredible.

742
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:58,574
Um. I was thinking about Dad's old desk.

743
00:45:00,909 --> 00:45:02,410
Would you still like it?

744
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,350
Yes.

745
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:07,350
Good.

746
00:45:07,351 --> 00:45:10,355
He'd be so pleased.

747
00:45:12,524 --> 00:45:16,528
Now. I haven't started
packing up his things yet.

748
00:45:16,529 --> 00:45:20,367
I know I should but...

749
00:45:20,368 --> 00:45:23,371
Well. Um. I was thinking that I could.

750
00:45:23,372 --> 00:45:24,806
Come home and help you.

751
00:45:24,807 --> 00:45:26,375
After this case is done.

752
00:45:26,376 --> 00:45:30,382
Well.

753
00:45:31,382 --> 00:45:34,385
That'd be nice.

754
00:45:34,386 --> 00:45:36,355
Where could it go?

755
00:45:36,356 --> 00:45:38,357
Well you could play house here.

756
00:45:38,358 --> 00:45:39,358
I Or better still

757
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:43,967
house husband in North Bay. Brrr

758
00:45:48,371 --> 00:45:52,375
Y'know. I don't understand...

759
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:53,976
why Tru hasn't come by.

760
00:45:53,977 --> 00:45:54,977
Tried to contact me.

761
00:45:54,978 --> 00:45:56,980
It just doesn't...

762
00:45:56,981 --> 00:45:58,549
It just doesn't make any sense.

763
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,985
Have you heard from her?

764
00:46:00,986 --> 00:46:02,988
Y'know. L. um.

765
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:07,994
I like Tru. But she is not that reliable.

766
00:46:07,995 --> 00:46:10,998
Really? And I found her quite the opposite.

767
00:46:10,999 --> 00:46:14,002
Well she has a reputation for it.

768
00:46:14,003 --> 00:46:15,003
For what?

769
00:46:15,004 --> 00:46:16,004
Tojust...

770
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:17,540
to vanish?

771
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,976
To disappear without saying a word?

772
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,746
Yeah.

773
00:46:21,747 --> 00:46:24,014
But um don't. Don't take it personally.

774
00:46:24,015 --> 00:46:29,025
I just come to accept it about her.

775
00:46:30,624 --> 00:46:34,027
She called me a "mother fucker_'"

776
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,029
Stop it!

777
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:37,031
Well. She does have a point.

778
00:46:37,032 --> 00:46:39,534
I am not doing anything.

779
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:41,471
Given your history with Suzanne.

780
00:46:41,472 --> 00:46:43,039
I'd say you're playing with fire

781
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,041
and you are going to get burned.

782
00:46:45,042 --> 00:46:47,044
Burned!

783
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:48,480
New shooters.

784
00:46:48,481 --> 00:46:50,048
On the house.

785
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:53,052
Trying new flavors.

786
00:46:53,053 --> 00:46:58,062
That's exactly what you need.

787
00:47:00,062 --> 00:47:03,064
You're such a fool.

788
00:47:03,065 --> 00:47:07,070
That's love's job. Honey...

789
00:47:07,071 --> 00:47:10,073
to make idiots of us.

790
00:47:10,074 --> 00:47:12,779
Richard.

791
00:47:13,078 --> 00:47:15,547
This what it was like for you?

792
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:19,085
Y'know I tried. I tried to love you.

793
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,555
I did.

794
00:47:21,556 --> 00:47:24,661
I know you did.

795
00:47:25,061 --> 00:47:28,064
I'm sorry.

796
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:36,811
I'm not very good at this.

797
00:47:45,086 --> 00:47:48,090
Alice!

798
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,092
Alice?

799
00:47:50,093 --> 00:47:51,093
Alice! Wait.

800
00:47:51,094 --> 00:47:53,864
Alice.

801
00:47:55,099 --> 00:47:57,101
Alice? What's wrong?

802
00:47:57,102 --> 00:47:59,103
What's wrong? Everything's wrong.

803
00:47:59,104 --> 00:48:03,075
I waited two days for you. Two. Days.

804
00:48:03,076 --> 00:48:04,810
How could you do that to me?

805
00:48:04,811 --> 00:48:08,082
I did show up. l...

806
00:48:12,088 --> 00:48:14,089
The Pussy Whisperer.

807
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:14,890
Alice?

808
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:16,626
He-he-hey. Wai-wait. Stop!

809
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:20,831
I feel so... stupid.

810
00:48:20,832 --> 00:48:24,102
I did come to see you. I tried!

811
00:48:24,103 --> 00:48:26,105
Look I'm freezing. Can we go inside?

812
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:28,107
You have company.

813
00:48:28,108 --> 00:48:29,175
That's nothing.

814
00:48:29,176 --> 00:48:32,112
I just didn't. Didn't want
to be alone last night.

815
00:48:32,113 --> 00:48:34,115
OK. Wait here a minute.

816
00:48:34,116 --> 00:48:35,950
I'm going to get a c-coat on

817
00:48:35,951 --> 00:48:39,089
and I'll be back so we can talk. OK?

818
00:48:40,091 --> 00:48:41,091
Yikes.

819
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:45,096
What's up with mom?

820
00:48:45,097 --> 00:48:49,103
Thanks for last night.

821
00:48:50,103 --> 00:48:53,106
If you rush. You can make the next fairy.

822
00:48:53,107 --> 00:48:54,108
I'm sorry.

823
00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:57,112
Alice!

824
00:48:57,112 --> 00:48:59,114
Alice. Wait.

825
00:48:59,115 --> 00:49:00,115
Wait, stop.

826
00:49:00,116 --> 00:49:02,118
Where are you going?

827
00:49:02,119 --> 00:49:04,120
Why didn't you come?

828
00:49:04,121 --> 00:49:06,123
I did come.

829
00:49:06,124 --> 00:49:07,124
I went to see you.

830
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:10,129
Suzanne told me you were sick.

831
00:49:10,129 --> 00:49:14,135
I wasn't sick.

832
00:49:15,101 --> 00:49:18,105
Did you get my note?

833
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:20,107
Why would she do that?

834
00:49:20,108 --> 00:49:21,709
I mean lie.

835
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:25,115
To me! And to you.

836
00:49:26,116 --> 00:49:29,118
Alice...

837
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,123
What?

838
00:49:33,124 --> 00:49:34,859
I thought that we had worked it out

839
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:37,129
but I guess she's still upset with me.

840
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,866
Upset. Upset about what?

841
00:49:40,867 --> 00:49:43,737
I think it would be better if she told you.

842
00:49:43,738 --> 00:49:47,141
Told me! What?!

843
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:50,278
Y'know I'm so damn tired
of being kept in the dark.

844
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,281
It's highly overrated.

845
00:49:52,282 --> 00:49:54,150
It's complicated.

846
00:49:54,151 --> 00:49:59,093
Yeah well. Why don't you
j ust uncom plicate it?

847
00:50:07,168 --> 00:50:09,170
Remember when I told you that

848
00:50:09,171 --> 00:50:12,173
"confused women like to sleep with me" too?

849
00:50:12,174 --> 00:50:14,176
Yes.

850
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:18,181
One time...

851
00:50:18,182 --> 00:50:20,184
One time?

852
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:24,189
When I stayed over at her place...

853
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:25,891
Suzanne and you?

854
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:29,162
We both had too much to drink... and...

855
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:32,933
You and Suzanne...

856
00:50:32,934 --> 00:50:36,171
We woke up in bed together...

857
00:50:36,172 --> 00:50:37,740
and...

858
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:39,175
that was...

859
00:50:39,176 --> 00:50:42,180
awkward.

860
00:50:45,184 --> 00:50:47,218
She couldn't talk about it and...

861
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:52,194
that was the last time I stayed with her.

862
00:50:53,194 --> 00:50:56,198
How long ago?

863
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,971
June.

864
00:51:01,204 --> 00:51:04,342
So shortly after Richard died.

865
00:51:05,176 --> 00:51:08,179
We bumped into each other awhile ago.

866
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,180
She said she missed me.

867
00:51:09,181 --> 00:51:12,184
Wanted to reconnect.

868
00:51:12,185 --> 00:51:16,189
She seemed really happy about that.

869
00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:18,192
We had comee. And talked.

870
00:51:18,193 --> 00:51:21,196
Not about that.

871
00:51:21,197 --> 00:51:25,203
I thought we were OK. But...

872
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:29,207
I'm sorry.

873
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,910
L...I'm...

874
00:51:32,911 --> 00:51:36,215
I don't know what to say.

875
00:51:36,216 --> 00:51:38,218
We can still be friends though.

876
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:40,153
Can't we. Alice?

877
00:51:40,154 --> 00:51:41,221
Friends? Yes. Of course.

878
00:51:41,222 --> 00:51:45,195
Friends. That's what we are.

879
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:48,196
Sorry I doubted you.

880
00:51:48,197 --> 00:51:52,203
I thought you were tired of me.

881
00:51:53,204 --> 00:51:56,207
I could never tire of you.

882
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:58,209
Really?

883
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:01,214
Really.

884
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:06,219
So was this our...

885
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,223
our first fight?

886
00:52:09,224 --> 00:52:14,232
Our first misunderstanding.

887
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,202
I stepped on it.

888
00:52:18,203 --> 00:52:21,206
The poor thing.

889
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:25,178
It? Or me?

890
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:27,214
Both.

891
00:52:31,219 --> 00:52:34,223
Darling.

892
00:52:34,223 --> 00:52:36,225
Hi Mother.

893
00:52:36,226 --> 00:52:37,393
Hi.

894
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:40,230
Tru's cooking up a storm.

895
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:41,231
Yeah. I see that.

896
00:52:41,232 --> 00:52:42,232
Cordon bleu.

897
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:43,234
Will you join us?

898
00:52:43,235 --> 00:52:44,302
L have so much work to do.

899
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:46,238
Y'know workwill always be here.

900
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:48,373
I however. Will not.

901
00:52:48,374 --> 00:52:50,243
Mother...

902
00:52:50,244 --> 00:52:52,245
Sojoin us.

903
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:53,247
Please.

904
00:52:53,248 --> 00:52:55,249
I insist.

905
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:57,252
If you insist.

906
00:52:57,253 --> 00:53:00,256
Now.

907
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:04,196
Won't this be fun.

908
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:08,266
Tru. This is...

909
00:53:08,267 --> 00:53:11,204
it's just delicious.

910
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,408
So it's all finally moving forward? Is it?

911
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:20,117
Yes. Finally.

912
00:53:21,283 --> 00:53:22,284
There we are.

913
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:26,289
There. That's better.

914
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:28,291
Well I'm glad.

915
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:31,295
This has been quite a trial for you.

916
00:53:31,296 --> 00:53:32,264
A trial?

917
00:53:32,265 --> 00:53:33,265
Yes.

918
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:36,269
Funny. Mother.

919
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,272
So are you. Are you seeing anyone?

920
00:53:39,273 --> 00:53:42,276
Wha-um... no.

921
00:53:42,277 --> 00:53:46,281
No secret lovers?

922
00:53:46,282 --> 00:53:47,283
Um more?

923
00:53:47,284 --> 00:53:49,285
Yeah Suzanne. Would you like...

924
00:53:49,286 --> 00:53:51,288
seconds?

925
00:53:51,289 --> 00:53:55,229
No.

926
00:54:07,342 --> 00:54:12,281
Well wasn't that lovely?

927
00:54:12,282 --> 00:54:18,288
She's so thoughtful and so kind.

928
00:54:18,289 --> 00:54:25,289
So you keep saying?

929
00:54:25,298 --> 00:54:28,301
Is um...

930
00:54:28,302 --> 00:54:33,140
ls there something that
you want to tell me?

931
00:54:33,141 --> 00:54:34,309
Nope.

932
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:40,317
Nothing? Nothing at all?

933
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,320
OK. I don't know what she said to you.

934
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,655
Suzanne come back here.

935
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:50,296
Come back here and sit down.

936
00:54:50,297 --> 00:54:53,535
Sit.

937
00:55:02,546 --> 00:55:06,319
I went to her place.

938
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:11,323
When she failed to show up
here for two days straight

939
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:15,328
without calling to cancel I
knew something was wrong.

940
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:17,331
I was worried.

941
00:55:17,332 --> 00:55:19,334
You saw that.

942
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:22,170
You knew that she'd been here twice.

943
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:27,310
Twice!

944
00:55:27,311 --> 00:55:28,311
She made me soup.

945
00:55:28,312 --> 00:55:31,315
She left a note.

946
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:33,317
So...

947
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:37,723
why would you lie to me?

948
00:55:37,724 --> 00:55:39,293
To protect you.

949
00:55:40,327 --> 00:55:41,495
To protect me?

950
00:55:41,496 --> 00:55:42,729
>From her.

951
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:45,200
>From Tru? And why would rhar be?

952
00:55:45,201 --> 00:55:46,201
Am I on trial here?

953
00:55:46,202 --> 00:55:47,335
Yes in fact you are.

954
00:55:47,336 --> 00:55:48,271
Well-

955
00:55:48,272 --> 00:55:49,338
Why!

956
00:55:49,339 --> 00:55:50,339
You were sick.

957
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:53,343
?s that the real reason?

958
00:55:53,344 --> 00:55:54,712
You were vulnerable.

959
00:55:54,713 --> 00:55:56,214
Is that the real reason?

960
00:55:56,215 --> 00:55:57,348
What are you suggesting?!

961
00:55:57,349 --> 00:55:59,351
I'm suggesting that there
might be another reason

962
00:55:59,352 --> 00:56:04,361
for your blatant display of insecurity.

963
00:56:05,494 --> 00:56:07,728
You slept together.

964
00:56:07,729 --> 00:56:09,364
Something transpired.

965
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:11,767
I have no idea what.

966
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:15,371
You have feelings.

967
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,774
Unresolved feelings.

968
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:22,380
Good or bad which is it?

969
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:24,383
WHICH IS IT?

970
00:56:24,384 --> 00:56:27,388
Mother.

971
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:33,397
Wow.

972
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:07,405
SOFT KNOCK ON THE DOOR

973
00:57:07,406 --> 00:57:10,409
Suzanne?

974
00:57:20,389 --> 00:57:23,393
Are you OK?

975
00:57:34,775 --> 00:57:39,349
I'm sorry I upset you.

976
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:46,422
I know we seem to be doing a lot of that

977
00:57:46,423 --> 00:57:48,625
to each other lately.

978
00:57:48,626 --> 00:57:53,400
Can we talk tomorrow?

979
00:57:54,766 --> 00:57:59,407
Of course. Yes of course. Tomorrow.

980
00:58:00,374 --> 00:58:02,508
Now that this is all. You know.

981
00:58:02,509 --> 00:58:06,483
Out in the open.

982
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,430
Goodnight darling.

983
00:58:19,431 --> 00:58:22,369
Goodnight.

984
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:48,434
Hi.

985
00:58:48,435 --> 00:58:50,570
Hi.

986
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:52,439
You told my mother we slept together.

987
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:53,808
We did sleep together.

988
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:54,809
Yes. I know that.

989
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,444
But why did you tell her?

990
00:58:56,445 --> 00:58:58,447
She wanted to know what was going on.

991
00:58:58,448 --> 00:58:59,448
It's none of her business.

992
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:01,818
Well you made it her
business by lying to her.

993
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:05,589
It's my privacy. My decision.

994
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:07,458
It's mine too.

995
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:08,460
I can see where this is going.

996
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,594
Where?

997
00:59:09,595 --> 00:59:10,529
You're trying to control this conversation

998
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,465
just like you do everything.

999
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,466
That's why you came here.

1000
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,467
No.

1001
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:15,836
I came here because I wanted to meet you

1002
00:59:15,837 --> 00:59:17,604
as far away from my mother as possible.

1003
00:59:17,605 --> 00:59:19,474
She is vulnerable just like I was.

1004
00:59:19,475 --> 00:59:22,845
You crawled into bed with me Suzanne.

1005
00:59:22,846 --> 00:59:27,487
Stay the fuck away from my mother.

1006
00:59:39,467 --> 00:59:41,469
DOORBELL

1007
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:42,470
Ye-?

1008
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:43,472
Tru?

1009
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:45,474
Why. I'm not quite made up.

1010
00:59:45,475 --> 00:59:47,477
I wasn't expecting you for hours.

1011
00:59:47,478 --> 00:59:48,478
I'm sorry.

1012
00:59:48,479 --> 00:59:50,046
No. No. No need.

1013
00:59:50,047 --> 00:59:50,647
I'm happy to see you.

1014
00:59:50,648 --> 00:59:51,548
Come on in.

1015
00:59:51,549 --> 00:59:54,486
You can relax. She's not here.

1016
00:59:54,487 --> 00:59:56,488
So. Why don't you have a seat

1017
00:59:56,489 --> 00:59:57,489
and I'll finish getting ready.

1018
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,492
I won't be a moment.

1019
00:59:59,493 --> 01:00:00,493
Alice. l...

1020
01:00:00,494 --> 01:00:04,064
I need to talk to you.

1021
01:00:04,065 --> 01:00:05,500
OK?

1022
01:00:05,501 --> 01:00:09,505
Sounds serious?

1023
01:00:09,506 --> 01:00:11,507
It's about Suzanne.

1024
01:00:11,508 --> 01:00:16,517
Well. What about her?

1025
01:00:25,493 --> 01:00:28,497
Mother.

1026
01:00:29,498 --> 01:00:32,501
Suzanne.

1027
01:00:32,502 --> 01:00:34,504
You alright? You look um...

1028
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:39,112
I look umm. What?

1029
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:44,085
What have you Been up to today?

1030
01:00:45,117 --> 01:00:50,127
I've had a very interesting day. So far.

1031
01:00:53,728 --> 01:00:57,869
I had a visitor.

1032
01:00:58,134 --> 01:01:01,137
How dare you banish her from seeing me.

1033
01:01:01,138 --> 01:01:03,139
Who do you thinkyou are?

1034
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,141
Your daughter.

1035
01:01:04,142 --> 01:01:05,142
Or have you forgotten?

1036
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:08,146
It is none of your business.

1037
01:01:08,147 --> 01:01:09,147
It is my business.

1038
01:01:09,148 --> 01:01:10,148
You are my mother.

1039
01:01:10,149 --> 01:01:11,150
Start acting like it.

1040
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:14,154
It is my life and I will
do as I damn well please.

1041
01:01:14,155 --> 01:01:19,160
And I'll do what's necessary.

1042
01:01:19,161 --> 01:01:23,165
Well maybe I should leave.

1043
01:01:23,166 --> 01:01:27,107
Maybe you should.

1044
01:01:40,122 --> 01:01:41,756
Why are you so stuck on seeing her?

1045
01:01:41,757 --> 01:01:42,624
I like her.

1046
01:01:42,625 --> 01:01:43,625
I like spending time with her

1047
01:01:43,626 --> 01:01:44,192
and that should be enough.

1048
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:45,694
Yeah. I know you do.

1049
01:01:45,695 --> 01:01:47,196
More than you like spending time with me.

1050
01:01:47,197 --> 01:01:50,200
You are being childish.

1051
01:01:50,201 --> 01:01:51,201
Why should you care?

1052
01:01:51,202 --> 01:01:52,202
You don't have any time for me.

1053
01:01:52,203 --> 01:01:54,606
You've never had any time for me.

1054
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:57,209
Who are you reallyjealous of?!

1055
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:58,611
I'm not gay.

1056
01:01:58,612 --> 01:02:00,213
?f that's what you're suggesting.

1057
01:02:00,214 --> 01:02:02,783
Me thinks the lady
doth protest too m uch.

1058
01:02:02,784 --> 01:02:04,785
It was once and nothing came of it.

1059
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:06,121
That does not make me gay.

1060
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:09,191
No. But it does make you frightened.

1061
01:02:09,192 --> 01:02:10,927
Y'know...

1062
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:13,196
maybe Tru's right.

1063
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:15,199
Maybe you are simply confused.

1064
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,200
Tru?

1065
01:02:16,201 --> 01:02:17,201
Tru. ?s that all you can talk about?

1066
01:02:17,202 --> 01:02:18,203
It's sick.

1067
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:19,204
You're obsessed.

1068
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:20,205
Leave me be.

1069
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:22,142
At your age it's pathetic.

1070
01:02:22,143 --> 01:02:22,775
Get out!

1071
01:02:22,776 --> 01:02:24,210
What about dad?

1072
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:29,219
Have you forgotten about him already?

1073
01:02:59,957 --> 01:03:03,227
Maybe Claire and Suzanne
are right about me.

1074
01:03:03,228 --> 01:03:06,231
About what?

1075
01:03:06,232 --> 01:03:08,234
I'm a hazard.

1076
01:03:08,235 --> 01:03:10,302
Should come with a warning label.

1077
01:03:10,303 --> 01:03:11,804
You should.

1078
01:03:11,805 --> 01:03:15,243
A big ass caution sign.

1079
01:03:15,244 --> 01:03:19,215
Seriously Gray.

1080
01:03:19,216 --> 01:03:23,221
You've known me longer than anybody else.

1081
01:03:23,221 --> 01:03:26,224
What is wrong with me?

1082
01:03:26,225 --> 01:03:28,226
Nothing but hurt.

1083
01:03:28,227 --> 01:03:31,096
Old hurt.

1084
01:03:31,097 --> 01:03:31,329
You're running. Baby girl.

1085
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:33,233
We both are.

1086
01:03:33,234 --> 01:03:37,204
Run. Run. Run.

1087
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:40,977
I'm tired of running.

1088
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:54,259
She's as much you as she is me. Alice.

1089
01:03:54,260 --> 01:03:59,232
Your beauty. Your temper. Your passion.

1090
01:03:59,233 --> 01:04:03,337
My bloody arrogance.

1091
01:04:03,338 --> 01:04:05,240
I'm sorry if l...

1092
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:09,246
put you in a box.

1093
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:12,248
Maybe I was afraid if I opened it.

1094
01:04:12,249 --> 01:04:15,252
Even a little.

1095
01:04:15,253 --> 01:04:19,259
You would leave me.

1096
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:31,274
Can I come in?

1097
01:04:32,275 --> 01:04:35,279
Yes.

1098
01:04:53,136 --> 01:04:57,309
I'm sorry I said those things.

1099
01:05:04,449 --> 01:05:08,320
I'm sorry too.

1100
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,290
I said some terrible things to you.

1101
01:05:10,291 --> 01:05:14,297
I didn't mean them.

1102
01:05:16,298 --> 01:05:17,299
Y'know it's true.

1103
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:20,169
You should be apologizing to me.

1104
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:24,310
You were very cruel to me.

1105
01:05:25,310 --> 01:05:29,314
Whatever went on between the two of you

1106
01:05:29,315 --> 01:05:31,149
Suzanne...

1107
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:33,319
or not,

1108
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:34,321
let it go.

1109
01:05:34,322 --> 01:05:38,327
It's over.

1110
01:05:38,327 --> 01:05:43,335
Wait until you're my age to
start torturing yourself.

1111
01:05:44,334 --> 01:05:46,036
Please. Sort.

1112
01:05:46,037 --> 01:05:47,304
Sort this thing out with her.

1113
01:05:47,305 --> 01:05:52,311
This mess. This confusion.

1114
01:05:52,312 --> 01:05:57,053
For your sake and for no other reason.

1115
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:02,325
I don't understand any of it.

1116
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,327
I know.

1117
01:06:05,328 --> 01:06:09,334
But maybe one day you will.

1118
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,343
Suzanne.

1119
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:21,349
If only you could see.

1120
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:27,054
Life slips away so quickly.

1121
01:06:27,055 --> 01:06:30,325
It's over in the blink of an eye.

1122
01:06:30,326 --> 01:06:32,328
And most people are too asleep

1123
01:06:32,329 --> 01:06:35,567
to even notice.

1124
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:07,407
Hey.

1125
01:07:07,408 --> 01:07:08,341
Sorry.

1126
01:07:08,342 --> 01:07:10,343
Um.

1127
01:07:10,344 --> 01:07:13,447
I mean...

1128
01:07:13,448 --> 01:07:17,221
I'm sorry.

1129
01:07:18,355 --> 01:07:20,356
Is that it?

1130
01:07:20,357 --> 01:07:23,361
No. Um.

1131
01:07:23,361 --> 01:07:25,363
You were right.

1132
01:07:25,364 --> 01:07:27,365
I was avoiding you.

1133
01:07:27,366 --> 01:07:29,368
I was...

1134
01:07:29,369 --> 01:07:31,370
waiting for you tojust...

1135
01:07:31,371 --> 01:07:34,374
90 aWay.

1136
01:07:34,375 --> 01:07:36,377
Because I'm a...

1137
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:39,381
I'm a coward.

1138
01:07:39,382 --> 01:07:40,382
I mean.

1139
01:07:40,383 --> 01:07:42,518
I fucked up Claire and I

1140
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:46,524
am fucked up.

1141
01:07:46,591 --> 01:07:51,131
Just want you to know that I know that now.

1142
01:07:51,397 --> 01:07:54,600
Good for you.

1143
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:58,405
Hey look. I don't expect
you to forgive me...

1144
01:07:58,406 --> 01:07:59,406
because I don't...

1145
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:02,410
forgive me.

1146
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,413
I just...

1147
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:05,414
I dunno...

1148
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:09,419
wanted to say I was sorry and

1149
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:11,421
I wanted to give you

1150
01:08:11,423 --> 01:08:15,262
the key to your house back.

1151
01:08:20,401 --> 01:08:22,403
Take care.

1152
01:08:22,404 --> 01:08:25,407
Ok?

1153
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:53,408
Hi.

1154
01:08:53,409 --> 01:08:54,410
Hi.

1155
01:08:54,411 --> 01:08:56,412
Come on in.

1156
01:08:56,413 --> 01:08:59,417
Thanks.

1157
01:09:00,418 --> 01:09:01,419
Hi.

1158
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:04,423
I made a cake.

1159
01:09:06,426 --> 01:09:08,427
My birthday.

1160
01:09:08,428 --> 01:09:09,429
Yeah.

1161
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:12,433
Tru.

1162
01:09:12,434 --> 01:09:14,568
Thank you darling.

1163
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:16,438
Would you like a drink?

1164
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:19,241
I'll put this in the kitchen. OK?

1165
01:09:19,242 --> 01:09:21,444
Wine if you have it.

1166
01:09:21,445 --> 01:09:23,781
Yes.

1167
01:09:28,421 --> 01:09:32,294
Um...

1168
01:09:33,427 --> 01:09:34,428
Um...

1169
01:09:34,429 --> 01:09:39,434
I like you Tru. I really do.

1170
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:41,437
But...

1171
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:44,508
But... um...

1172
01:09:44,608 --> 01:09:47,444
I'm just not sure that I'm...

1173
01:09:47,445 --> 01:09:48,446
9ay.

1174
01:09:48,447 --> 01:09:52,453
I don't know what I am.

1175
01:09:54,287 --> 01:09:56,456
I think that's why I um.

1176
01:09:56,457 --> 01:09:57,457
Freaked out on you.

1177
01:09:57,458 --> 01:09:59,693
I was feeling um.

1178
01:09:59,694 --> 01:10:03,431
A bit threatened and

1179
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:06,669
confused. I guess.

1180
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:10,676
It's OK to be confused.

1181
01:10:10,842 --> 01:10:14,445
I think my mother might be a bit

1182
01:10:14,446 --> 01:10:17,449
confused.

1183
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:21,454
Thank you for making her a cake.

1184
01:10:21,455 --> 01:10:23,323
No problem.

1185
01:10:23,324 --> 01:10:24,458
You're gonna stay for her

1186
01:10:24,459 --> 01:10:28,463
her last dinner?

1187
01:10:28,464 --> 01:10:32,468
I'd... love to.

1188
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:35,474
Good.

1189
01:10:38,477 --> 01:10:39,879
God!

1190
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:42,415
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1191
01:10:42,482 --> 01:10:45,485
I'm so sorry. It's such a mess.

1192
01:10:45,486 --> 01:10:47,487
Yes. I'm so clumsy lately. l...

1193
01:10:47,488 --> 01:10:48,556
it's. ?t's alright Alice.

1194
01:10:48,557 --> 01:10:49,891
It was just an accident.

1195
01:10:49,892 --> 01:10:52,494
No and y'know what?

1196
01:10:52,495 --> 01:10:54,496
Mother?

1197
01:10:54,497 --> 01:10:55,865
Tru is right.

1198
01:10:55,866 --> 01:10:59,503
And. ?n fact. Lets um. Let's toast to it.

1199
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:03,508
To messy accidents.

1200
01:11:03,509 --> 01:11:05,344
Who are you?

1201
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:10,420
And what have you done with my daughter?

1202
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:15,527
To messy accidents.

1203
01:11:16,492 --> 01:11:18,494
And now if you um...

1204
01:11:18,495 --> 01:11:20,430
lovely ladies will excuse me.

1205
01:11:20,431 --> 01:11:22,499
I have to go back to the oMce.

1206
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:23,500
Honey.

1207
01:11:23,501 --> 01:11:24,502
It's the final push

1208
01:11:24,503 --> 01:11:28,507
and exhausted as I am I must keep going.

1209
01:11:28,508 --> 01:11:30,944
Try not to be too late getting home. OK?

1210
01:11:30,945 --> 01:11:31,511
OK.

1211
01:11:31,512 --> 01:11:33,513
Happy birthday.

1212
01:11:33,514 --> 01:11:36,952
Thank you.

1213
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:43,526
Lets talk soon. OK?

1214
01:11:43,527 --> 01:11:47,531
Yeah. Let's.

1215
01:11:47,532 --> 01:11:49,534
Bye.

1216
01:11:49,535 --> 01:11:55,512
Well. All's well that ends well.

1217
01:11:57,512 --> 01:12:01,518
One last walk.

1218
01:12:06,724 --> 01:12:09,526
In my next life...

1219
01:12:09,527 --> 01:12:11,529
I will come back...

1220
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:13,531
as a great dancer like

1221
01:12:13,532 --> 01:12:15,600
lsadora Duncan and you will be...

1222
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:20,544
my lover.

1223
01:12:25,548 --> 01:12:28,886
Come on.

1224
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:34,525
Well. Goodbye. Alice.

1225
01:12:34,526 --> 01:12:36,461
What's this I see?

1226
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:40,533
Tears.

1227
01:12:40,534 --> 01:12:42,535
No onions.

1228
01:12:42,536 --> 01:12:45,540
No.

1229
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:49,611
Don't go yet.

1230
01:12:49,612 --> 01:12:51,713
I don't want to prolong this.

1231
01:12:51,714 --> 01:12:53,550
I'm not very good with "goodbyes_'"

1232
01:12:53,551 --> 01:12:55,552
Or birthdays.

1233
01:12:55,553 --> 01:12:57,555
Or funerals.

1234
01:12:57,556 --> 01:13:00,559
I'm not good with much. Am I?

1235
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:04,565
You good with a night cap?

1236
01:13:04,565 --> 01:13:07,533
You are a very bad influence on me.

1237
01:13:07,534 --> 01:13:11,708
Thank you. Come on.

1238
01:13:16,546 --> 01:13:17,546
Hey.

1239
01:13:17,547 --> 01:13:19,549
Hi.

1240
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:22,553
Let's toast.

1241
01:13:22,554 --> 01:13:24,555
To what?

1242
01:13:24,556 --> 01:13:26,792
To true love.

1243
01:13:26,793 --> 01:13:29,562
To true love.

1244
01:13:29,563 --> 01:13:34,571
Wherever it may be.

1245
01:15:24,243 --> 01:15:27,246
How could you just loose
yourself like that?

1246
01:15:27,247 --> 01:15:28,248
Lose myself.

1247
01:15:28,249 --> 01:15:31,251
Find myself.

1248
01:15:31,252 --> 01:15:34,255
It's all the same in the end.

1249
01:15:34,256 --> 01:15:37,259
It's wrong.

1250
01:15:37,260 --> 01:15:41,264
It's life.

1251
01:15:41,265 --> 01:15:45,269
I am not ready to accept
you and Tru together.

1252
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:49,276
I'm not sure I ever will be.

1253
01:15:50,277 --> 01:15:53,280
Darling.

1254
01:15:53,281 --> 01:16:00,281
I hope that you find someone
to love with all your heart.

1255
01:16:02,025 --> 01:16:04,294
And ifyour heart breaks.

1256
01:16:04,295 --> 01:16:09,103
I hope it breaks wide open.

1257
01:16:40,341 --> 01:16:41,341
Hi Alice.

1258
01:16:41,342 --> 01:16:43,344
It's me Tru.

1259
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:47,315
I miss you.

1260
01:16:47,316 --> 01:16:49,317
This is your "welcome home" message.

1261
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:53,358
So. Welcome home.

1262
01:16:53,891 --> 01:16:55,325
Standing where

1263
01:16:55,326 --> 01:16:56,326
We did the tango.

1264
01:16:56,327 --> 01:16:59,330
Thought I might twirl but um...

1265
01:16:59,331 --> 01:17:01,367
wouldn't be the same without you.

1266
01:17:01,368 --> 01:17:03,903
Anyway you're probably sleeping om

1267
01:17:03,904 --> 01:17:07,074
that long train ride so...

1268
01:17:07,075 --> 01:17:09,077
Message number three.

1269
01:17:09,078 --> 01:17:11,345
You must be busy or something.

1270
01:17:11,346 --> 01:17:14,350
Anyway.

1271
01:17:14,350 --> 01:17:15,351
I hate leaving messages.

1272
01:17:15,352 --> 01:17:17,120
Just call me when you can. OK?

1273
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:19,356
I will leave my ringer on so...

1274
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:22,327
Hi Alice. ?t's me Tru.

1275
01:17:22,328 --> 01:17:26,333
The lunatic stalker.

1276
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:28,334
Is everything OK?

1277
01:17:28,335 --> 01:17:31,204
I'm starting to get a
little worried down here.

1278
01:17:31,205 --> 01:17:33,341
May have to break down
and call Suzanne if I-

1279
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:36,345
Tru?

1280
01:17:37,347 --> 01:17:39,882
Suzanne?

1281
01:17:39,883 --> 01:17:40,350
What are you doing there?

1282
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:42,352
Is everything OK?

1283
01:17:42,353 --> 01:17:44,355
No. Not really.

1284
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:45,356
What is it?

1285
01:17:45,357 --> 01:17:48,294
What's happened?

1286
01:17:51,365 --> 01:17:53,199
my Mom...

1287
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:53,366
Alice?

1288
01:17:53,367 --> 01:17:54,368
What?

1289
01:17:54,369 --> 01:17:55,436
What's wrong?

1290
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:59,341
She um...

1291
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,343
she...

1292
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:04,347
She. She what?

1293
01:18:04,348 --> 01:18:07,451
Suzanne. What?

1294
01:18:07,452 --> 01:18:10,355
She's gone. Tru.

1295
01:18:10,356 --> 01:18:11,356
She's um...

1296
01:18:11,357 --> 01:18:15,363
gone. Died.

1297
01:18:16,364 --> 01:18:18,365
What.

1298
01:18:18,366 --> 01:18:21,369
No.

1299
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:22,203
That's not possible.

1300
01:18:22,204 --> 01:18:24,373
What?

1301
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:25,374
I just saw her.

1302
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,377
She was fine.

1303
01:18:27,378 --> 01:18:28,378
No. She wasn't.

1304
01:18:28,379 --> 01:18:30,381
She had an aneurysm.

1305
01:18:30,382 --> 01:18:31,382
It was sudden.

1306
01:18:31,383 --> 01:18:32,383
She died on the train.

1307
01:18:32,384 --> 01:18:36,190
She never even made it home.

1308
01:18:36,355 --> 01:18:38,157
She was so sick.

1309
01:18:38,158 --> 01:18:39,358
How did I not know that?

1310
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,359
Did you know. Tru?

1311
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:43,230
Did she say anything to you?

1312
01:18:43,231 --> 01:18:44,365
No.

1313
01:18:44,366 --> 01:18:46,367
I don't. I don't know what to do.

1314
01:18:46,368 --> 01:18:48,370
I um...

1315
01:18:48,371 --> 01:18:51,373
the The funeral is on Saturday.

1316
01:18:51,374 --> 01:18:53,243
Can you come. Tru?

1317
01:18:53,244 --> 01:18:58,988
Can you um. Can you come?

1318
01:19:07,395 --> 01:19:08,395
Tru wait!

1319
01:19:08,396 --> 01:19:12,402
Stop.

1320
01:19:19,410 --> 01:19:21,980
I'm glad you came.

1321
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:23,414
I was such a bitch to her in the end.

1322
01:19:23,415 --> 01:19:26,151
I feel really terrible about that.

1323
01:19:26,152 --> 01:19:27,420
You have to try and forgive yourself.

1324
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:30,356
She would want that.

1325
01:19:30,357 --> 01:19:35,434
Besides you were just being yourself.

1326
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:45,443
You should go.

1327
01:19:45,444 --> 01:19:47,012
Take care ofyourself. OK?

1328
01:19:47,013 --> 01:19:49,415
I mean that.

1329
01:19:49,416 --> 01:19:54,424
You too.

1330
01:20:02,432 --> 01:20:04,434

Hey Tru!

1339
01:20:29,433 --> 01:20:30,433
Hi Scott.

1340
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:31,435
Hey!

1341
01:20:31,436 --> 01:20:34,305
You look like you had a nice vacation.

1342
01:20:34,306 --> 01:20:36,241
Yah. Shoulda gone to the Arctic

1343
01:20:36,242 --> 01:20:38,443
then coming back to this
would have been easy.

1344
01:20:38,444 --> 01:20:41,314
So we found this letter in our mailbox

1345
01:20:41,315 --> 01:20:43,450
and Mary-Anne figured it must be yours.

1346
01:20:43,451 --> 01:20:44,451
Gertrude?

1347
01:20:44,452 --> 01:20:45,452
Don't tell anyone.

1348
01:20:45,453 --> 01:20:50,459
No no. Your secret is safe with me.

1349
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:54,467
Say hi to Mary-Anne for me.

1350
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:56,477
Dearest Tru.

1351
01:21:56,478 --> 01:21:58,480
You have stolen my heart.

1352
01:21:58,481 --> 01:22:01,451
Paris in the spring?

1353
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,539
Ready?

1354
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,479
Yeah.
