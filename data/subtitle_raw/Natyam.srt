1
00:01:26,925 --> 00:01:27,718
How much is this?

2
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,551
4:30.

3
00:01:28,718 --> 00:01:30,843
12:40... What about this?

4
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:32,384
6:35.

5
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,467
Its 7:30.

6
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:34,694
Mommy!

7
00:01:34,718 --> 00:01:36,819
You're struggling to solve
such simple problems!

8
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:38,485
The clock has just two hands,

9
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,735
The hour hand and the minute hand,
How are you getting them mixed up?

10
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,610
Go on, write it again.

11
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:42,426
Lakshmi...

12
00:01:42,634 --> 00:01:44,884
She's just a little girl!
She'll learn eventually...

13
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,342
You stay quiet and let me teach her, or do
you want to take up this responsibility?

14
00:01:48,426 --> 00:01:50,259
Hey! Look, she ran away...

15
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,843
Sitara! Wait... Sitara!

16
00:01:55,384 --> 00:01:58,718
You're my princess dear, wait up!

17
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:00,175
Wait!

18
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,384
I cant catch up to your speed... Wait!

19
00:02:04,134 --> 00:02:08,175
Ill teach you a lesson once I catch you,
just wait!

20
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:10,676
Sitara!...Sitara!

21
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,050
Sitara!

22
00:02:28,884 --> 00:02:33,134
My greetings to the media and respected
people who are here on this occasion.

23
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:37,134
I thank everyone for being a part of
the Inaugration of this Dance academy.

24
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:40,676
Sir,
why is this village called 'Naatyam'?

25
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:42,384
It means Dance, right?

26
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:44,551
Theres a huge story behind it.

27
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,467
In those days...

28
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:52,592
The Britishers took away our Historical
texts, Books, Sculptures related to Dance.

29
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,336
In the course, they even destroyed
all the scriptures, books, sculptures...

30
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,089
...and even temples.

31
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:06,033
They made sure the word 'Classical dance'
was wiped out from entire India.

32
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,967
Classical dance which existed since
thousands of years shouldn't be wiped out.

33
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:17,384
So the heads of the village orchestrated
a huge Yajna (RITUAL) in the temple.

34
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,175
Vedic Scholars and priests were
conducting the Homa (RITUAL)

35
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:25,050
While the Dance Scholars were
inscribing the Science of Dance.

36
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:30,217
The britishers who got wind of this,
came there, broke down the doors.

37
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,259
Shot everyone there and
threw them into the fire.

38
00:03:34,843 --> 00:03:36,925
Unable to bear the bloodshed,

39
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:43,134
The Goddess emerged as
a form of destruction.

40
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:46,884
She incinerated the
Britishers there whilst,

41
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:51,884
The rest cowered and closed the Temple
gates to prevent her from getting out.

42
00:03:54,092 --> 00:03:58,843
A British Commanding Officer Francis,
permanently sealed the temple gates.

43
00:03:59,467 --> 00:04:03,301
Even after India became independent
from the British rule,

44
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,092
We still couldn't learn dance.

45
00:04:05,592 --> 00:04:11,843
While all the artists were
grieved about the loss of dance...

46
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:12,759
One day...

47
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,167
They opened the gates of that temple only
to see that the goddess is still there.

48
00:04:16,217 --> 00:04:19,843
Her eyes filled with rage and anger.

49
00:04:20,509 --> 00:04:23,634
Upon performing the peace prayer,

50
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:27,801
She was calmed down and handed
the Historical Dance scriptures...

51
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:30,440
To educate the upcoming generations
in the Art of Dance...

52
00:04:30,528 --> 00:04:32,673
...then transformed herself into a statue.

53
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:38,175
Many artists from around the country came
to this village to learn the Art of Dance.

54
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:41,759
They then settled into this place, turned
this village into a stage for dancing,

55
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:45,467
...and that's how the village got its name,
'Natyam'.

56
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:49,925
From then on, we started praying to
the Goddess as 'The Goddess of Dance'.

57
00:04:50,884 --> 00:04:56,342
Due to her immense glory,
we named this Dance school after her.

58
00:04:57,134 --> 00:05:01,634
Till now this campus was
given to our Guru temporarily.

59
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,009
But him along with his wife,

60
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:10,050
Transformed this into a School
of Dance and earned many laurels.

61
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:11,801
Which is why,

62
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:19,055
I have decided to give this
campus permanently to him.

63
00:05:26,801 --> 00:05:30,175
Hey! You ran off from the ritual again,
haven't you?

64
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:35,592
Hey! Sitara...

65
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:37,134
My God! Its Mom!

66
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:42,339
From today onward, you will bear the
responsibility of the keys to this place.

67
00:05:48,634 --> 00:05:50,259
Guru! Have you come across our kid?

68
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:52,634
No, I haven't.

69
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:56,843
She is such a brat.
Dont know where she runs off to...

70
00:06:08,924 --> 00:06:15,923
This campus belongs to Mr. Francis. The one
who shut the gates of the temple that day,

71
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:20,134
What's surprising is that,
while leaving for England,

72
00:06:20,676 --> 00:06:23,260
He wrote a will assigning
this bungalow and the car...

73
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:26,698
...to be used only for
the welfare of Dance.

74
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:05,080
"Even if this life ends
as a sacrifice for my art."

75
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:13,718
"This love has shed blood
as devotion towards my art."

76
00:07:19,342 --> 00:07:20,801
- Its like this!
- OK!

77
00:07:27,634 --> 00:07:32,301
Shalini, We have to provide a new part.
Prepare the stage right now.

78
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,175
Now dance with alapadmalu.

79
00:08:30,884 --> 00:08:32,592
When will Shalini maam come?

80
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,009
When will she begin the dance?

81
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:36,718
Hey! Come here.

82
00:08:40,009 --> 00:08:41,092
What are you up to?

83
00:08:41,426 --> 00:08:42,509
Im writing a story.

84
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,551
Aren't we supposed to dance?

85
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,132
Both are one and the same!

86
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:48,217
How? Can you explain clearly?

87
00:08:48,384 --> 00:08:52,175
Just like we listen to stories, when
they come to life in front of our eyes,

88
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:53,551
...we call it as a Dance.

89
00:08:54,009 --> 00:08:57,426
Dancing means, to present a
story in the most beautiful form.

90
00:08:57,634 --> 00:08:59,676
Oh...
So they tell stories through dancing?

91
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,009
Yes, indeed.

92
00:09:01,092 --> 00:09:07,426
We can also change someones thoughts
and beliefs through dancing.

93
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:09,301
That's the power of Dance!

94
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,509
So, what story are you writing?

95
00:09:11,925 --> 00:09:13,050
'Kaadambari Katha' (STORY)?

96
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:15,509
What story is that? Will you tell me?

97
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:17,467
Yes. I will.

98
00:09:32,384 --> 00:09:34,592
Guru ji! The story is very nice.

99
00:09:34,634 --> 00:09:36,843
I liked it! I will also do it.

100
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,301
What are you doing?

101
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:46,801
I am Kaadambari.

102
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,259
You keep narrating the story,
I will dance to it.

103
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:51,801
[LAUGHING]

104
00:09:54,884 --> 00:09:57,426
Why are you laughing?
Come, teach me how to dance!

105
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:01,509
It doesn't work like that.
Kaadambari is an artist.

106
00:10:01,718 --> 00:10:05,509
To tell her story,
you need to learn the art of dancing.

107
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:06,884
Learn!

108
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:09,426
I will give you that story
for your debut performance.

109
00:10:09,621 --> 00:10:12,286
So you'd definitely give me that
story for my debut performance?

110
00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:14,554
- Promise?
- Promise.

111
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:19,426
Guru ji! Shalini maam has been
bitten by a snake near the well!

112
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:20,554
Huh?

113
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:34,884
This has happened because of that
'Kaadambari katha'.

114
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,142
Yes, true.
'Kadambari Katha' brings ill fate.

115
00:10:37,342 --> 00:10:39,575
It is said that whoever
performs it will get cursed!

116
00:10:42,213 --> 00:10:45,046
DANCE

117
00:10:57,551 --> 00:10:59,634
Can you call the next contestant please?

118
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,718
Rohith, from Barefoot Dance Company.

119
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:08,738
[RAP]

120
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,833
"Dreams glide in me"?

121
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:32,306
"Thoughts cloud my mind"?

122
00:11:32,506 --> 00:11:34,619
"Crossing all hurdles"?

123
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,906
"Let me touch the stars"?

124
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:39,259
"Life is a one way journey"?

125
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:41,796
"Theres no rewind button to it"?

126
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,161
"Future is a huge mess"?

127
00:11:44,361 --> 00:11:46,546
"Right now fly high with me"?

128
00:11:47,384 --> 00:11:50,092
"My heart flies so high"?

129
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,551
"Sprinkles and leaps to the sky,
as I fly"?

130
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,884
"It flies across the sky"?

131
00:11:59,217 --> 00:12:01,341
"Doesnt wanna stay still on ground"?

132
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:05,009
"It sprinkles and leaps to the sky,
as I fly"?

133
00:13:08,843 --> 00:13:11,175
The energy in your dance is very good.

134
00:13:11,718 --> 00:13:14,342
But, I couldn't see any concept behind it.

135
00:13:14,746 --> 00:13:20,718
Aggressively jumping around
doing gymnastics isnt dance.

136
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,284
Make sure you conceptualize well,
the next time around.

137
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:25,843
Will you accept the request...

138
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:30,009
If given a chance, we will try something.

139
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,843
OK... you will go.

140
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:33,884
OK Ma'am...

141
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:36,884
Madam! Excuse me, please.

142
00:13:37,426 --> 00:13:42,277
Madam, dance isnt just some
time-pass or hobby for me...

143
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:43,884
Im very passionate about dancing,

144
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,134
I feel like Im connected to my soul.

145
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:49,259
See, I can understand.

146
00:13:49,843 --> 00:13:53,342
But, If you want to represent India
all the way across, in America,

147
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:56,134
Your performance needs to be much better.

148
00:13:57,092 --> 00:13:58,426
Give me one chance madam!

149
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:01,384
Well somehow manage to
get a great concept.

150
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,259
Then,
is it possible to get a wild card entry?

151
00:14:06,634 --> 00:14:07,884
Right now, we don't have any.

152
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:12,301
But our group will sit
together and brainstorm...

153
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:16,134
If you want to do something new,
you'll have to learn something new.

154
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:18,551
Do one thing.

155
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:20,426
Theres a village called "Natyam"?

156
00:14:20,509 --> 00:14:24,050
The speciality of the village is that
everyone there are classical dancers.

157
00:14:24,843 --> 00:14:26,884
For them,
dancing is a form of conveying a story.

158
00:14:26,925 --> 00:14:28,342
Its an art of storytelling.

159
00:14:28,676 --> 00:14:29,676
Why don't you go there?

160
00:14:29,718 --> 00:14:31,342
You might find some inspiration there.

161
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:32,925
OK... OK...

162
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:34,301
Ill do it! I got it.

163
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,884
Ill come back to you
with an amazing concept.

164
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:39,634
You go there and show me a concept.

165
00:14:39,843 --> 00:14:42,832
Then Ill think about your wild card entry.

166
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:43,913
OK!

167
00:14:44,113 --> 00:14:45,488
Thank you maam.

168
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,342
Sir. Can you tell us about
the glory of this goddess?

169
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:03,259
Dance was thought to be extinct,
during the britishers rule.

170
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:08,718
The Historical Texts given by the goddess,
rejuvenated the art form.

171
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,509
Can you please show it to
the media people, priest.

172
00:15:14,884 --> 00:15:16,134
See this, here...

173
00:15:18,426 --> 00:15:24,342
The goddess preserved these texts under
her feet and transformed into a statue.

174
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,467
The eternal glory of this temple,

Shiva and Parvati astonishingly.

Shall we leave, Shastri ji?

228
00:22:27,175 --> 00:22:28,259
Get up!

229
00:22:28,717 --> 00:22:29,842
Hey! Dancer!

230
00:22:30,092 --> 00:22:31,842
You are Sitara, right?

231
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,324
You put on a hell of a show there...

232
00:22:33,467 --> 00:22:36,467
I'll speak with my brother and
fix your spot in the upcoming fair.

233
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:36,985
Who is he?

234
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:38,759
He's the brother of our MLA.

235
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,175
My name is Veerabhadra.

236
00:22:41,467 --> 00:22:43,842
I couldn't get into
studies at all as a kid...

237
00:22:44,175 --> 00:22:46,717
But, I'm still very popular in this town.

238
00:22:47,592 --> 00:22:48,133
Hey!

239
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:49,259
Yes, Brother.

240
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:51,467
Keep it.

241
00:22:51,926 --> 00:22:52,759
It's OK, keep it.

242
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:53,467
I'll take it...

243
00:22:53,509 --> 00:22:54,509
You just wait, there...

244
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,009
Take it!

245
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,175

246
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:00,092

247
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:02,968
Move...

00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,217
Hi Sitara!

249
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,467
You danced very well. It was superb!

250
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:07,842
I need to speak with you once.

251
00:23:07,866 --> 00:23:08,866
Hey...

252
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:10,676
You danced very well!

253
00:23:11,551 --> 00:23:13,133
Hey Sitara! I need to speak with you.

254
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:15,509
Hey, I need to talk with that girl.

255
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:16,425
Let's go...

256
00:23:16,676 --> 00:23:18,968
Go! Hey, Ganesha! Don't send them...

257
00:23:19,092 --> 00:23:19,551
Swami...

258
00:23:19,676 --> 00:23:21,300
Sir, You're right on time.

259
00:23:21,384 --> 00:23:23,984
Look after this for a couple of minutes,
I'll be back in a moment.

260
00:23:24,384 --> 00:23:25,676
Hey! You wait, you wait.

261
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:26,217
Thanks!

262
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,300
Wait... wait...

263
00:23:29,926 --> 00:23:31,133
Who's this girl?

264
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:40,968
How is it now?

265
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:41,717
Show it...

266
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:42,842
It's okay...

267
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:44,009
Is it painful?

268
00:23:44,217 --> 00:23:48,676
You danced instead of me at
such short notice, Thanks.

269
00:23:48,801 --> 00:23:50,717
It's I who should thank you!

270
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:51,342
Why?

271
00:23:51,425 --> 00:23:56,009
I was waiting for the right opportunity to
show Guruji that I was ready for my debut.

272
00:23:56,717 --> 00:24:00,092
Thanks to you, I was able to do that!

273
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Vaishnavi.

274
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,309
- How are you feeling now?
- It's much better.

275
00:24:06,968 --> 00:24:07,968
Sitara.

276
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:09,118
You performed very well...

277
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:10,634
Have I truly done well?

278
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:13,009
Yes. But, you haven't
learned that bit right?

279
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,259
How were you able to do it?

280
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:17,384
I used to observe while you and
Vaishnavi were practicing...

281
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:18,801
That's how I learnt it!

282
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,290
It takes years of practice to
get these postures right...

283
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:24,829
It's amazing that you learnt
them just through observation!

284
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:27,217
You're very special, Sitara!

285
00:24:28,603 --> 00:24:30,961
You'll be part of all our
performances from now onward.

286
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:32,217
Oh thank you!

287
00:24:32,425 --> 00:24:33,425
I'll take care of it...

288
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:35,712
I'll personally teach you
everything you need to know.

289
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
Hmm...

290
00:24:39,009 --> 00:24:41,926
Hari sir! You need to clear
this up with Guru ji...

291
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:47,133
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop!

292
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:48,853
- [SITARA SCREAMS]
- Stop! Don't shout!

293
00:24:49,842 --> 00:24:50,842
Hey! Listen!

294
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:53,509
Hey! Please, Please, Please...

295
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,092
OK... OK. Just listen to me once.

296
00:24:55,217 --> 00:24:56,300
My name is Rohit.

297
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:57,634
I came from Hyderabad.

298
00:24:57,884 --> 00:25:00,009
I saw classical dance for
the first time in my life.

299
00:25:00,217 --> 00:25:01,217
It's brilliant!

300
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:02,342
You did extremely good!

301
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,026
I felt awestruck by your performance!

302
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:06,342
I just coudn't take my eyes off you...

303
00:25:06,509 --> 00:25:07,509
Hey! Shut your mouth.

304
00:25:07,926 --> 00:25:10,401
How dare you peep in to gawk at
us while we're changing clothes!

305
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,634
Shame on you idiot!

306
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:12,801
Excuse me, Madam.

307
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:15,926
If I really were an Idiot,
I would've been behind the stand.

308
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:17,801
And not confronted you directly!

309
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:20,717
We have a lot to talk about.

310
00:25:21,009 --> 00:25:22,092
Where have you come from?

311
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,300
Where did you learn dancing?

312
00:25:23,467 --> 00:25:25,317
- I really need to know about your dance...
- Hey, stop it.

313
00:25:25,341 --> 00:25:26,226
Can you just shut up.

314
00:25:26,363 --> 00:25:27,923
If you really want to know about dance,

315
00:25:28,118 --> 00:25:30,389
go and talk to our guru ji
in the dance school.

316
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:31,698
Now, get out!

317
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:32,835
Just for two minutes...

318
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:34,926
Hey! I'll go...

319
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,217
Guru ji.

320
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:12,968
How long will you just sit here
and mourn Shalini?

321
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,133
Leave that.

322
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:18,384
I heard that yesterday's performance
went really well! Is it true?

323
00:26:18,717 --> 00:26:19,217
Yes...

324
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:22,300
It seems that Vaishnavi and
Hari put on a great show!

325
00:26:22,384 --> 00:26:24,092
But, Guru ji, it was me who danced!

326
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:28,217
I know, dear... I read it on the papers.

327
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,592
'The performance that lit up the sky'

328
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:37,217
Hari and Sitara's outstanding performance
garnering all the praise!'

329
00:26:38,092 --> 00:26:40,175
Does this mean I'm ready for my Debut?

330
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:44,342
Why not!
You look more than ready for it...

331
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,968
Of course! I've been dreaming about
my debut since I was a child...

332
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,133
I'll be wearing a white saree.

333
00:26:51,342 --> 00:26:52,968
The jewelry should also be white!

334
00:26:53,926 --> 00:26:56,217
I don't want flowers on the stage...

335
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:58,401
We'll decorate the stage
with diyas all over!

336
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:01,652
On the invitation,
we'll have the photo that we took!

337
00:27:01,676 --> 00:27:03,342
The one with you, me and shalini...

338
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,259
But, Guru ji...

339
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,968
I have already decided the bit
I'm going to perform.

340
00:27:09,425 --> 00:27:12,509
Wow! You have decided that as well!

341
00:27:12,884 --> 00:27:13,884
What is it?

342
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:15,342
Have you forgotten?

343
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,759
You promised me right here,
when I was a child.

344
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:19,175
'Kaadambari Katha'

345
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:26,009
No, Sitara.

346
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,300
Don't perform 'Kaadambari Katha'?

347
00:27:28,425 --> 00:27:29,509
What happened, Guru ji?

348
00:27:30,259 --> 00:27:32,717
You do like Kaadambari Katha' right?

349
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:34,450
Why are you asking me not to do it?

350
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:36,926
Sitara... That story is ominous to us.

351
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:39,300
Whoever does it,
gets cursed in one way or another...

352
00:27:39,884 --> 00:27:42,592
That is the reason Shalini lost her life!

353
00:27:43,926 --> 00:27:49,425
What's the connection between Shalini
dying and 'Kaadambari Katha'?

354
00:27:49,926 --> 00:27:51,818
Look here. I'm your Guru.

355
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,343
You must do as I say.

356
00:27:53,592 --> 00:27:54,634
That's how it is done.

357
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:57,509
But, the debut is mine.

358
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,009
Every dancer has the right
to choose the bit they want!

359
00:28:01,175 --> 00:28:02,842
Why don't I get that?

360
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:06,092
I will only do Kaadambari Katha' Guru ji!

361
00:28:07,968 --> 00:28:09,759
I don't believe in curses and such.

362
00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:19,217
What's up with these people dude?

363
00:28:24,217 --> 00:28:26,634
Man this place look amazing!

364
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:44,759
Hey!

365
00:28:53,842 --> 00:28:54,926
How's that girl doing?

366
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:56,050
How's he teaching...

367
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:57,092
Hi!

368
00:28:57,509 --> 00:28:58,509
Have you recognized me?

369
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:01,425
What? Don't tell me you forgot!

370
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,040
It was you right, who told me
to come to the dance school!

371
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:06,467
Gangadhar!

372
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:08,342
Tell me ma'am.

373
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:09,631
Ask this man what he needs.

374
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,009
What's with this girl?
Doesn't she know how to smile?

375
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:17,509
It's time for the
Grand Master to arrive...

376
00:29:17,592 --> 00:29:20,717
She's worried whether she would get
selected to perform her debut performance.

377
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,175
What's a debut performance?

378
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,300
How do I say it...

379
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:25,527
Yeah! It's similar to how you
get called up on stage...

380
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:26,860
...and receive a certificate
upon completing your studies.

381
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:27,551
Uh... A Convocation?

382
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:28,717
Yes. Kind of like that...

383
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:30,735
That is referred to as a Debut
Performance in our culture.

384
00:29:30,759 --> 00:29:32,425
Yeah, but why worry about it?

385
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,300
I'm sure she'll pass with flying colors.

386
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:36,009
No doubt!

387
00:29:41,717 --> 00:29:43,117
Your training starts from tomorrow,

388
00:29:43,801 --> 00:29:44,592
You can leave for the day.

389
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:45,676
Please sir!

390
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,592
Give us one opportunity sir!

391
00:29:47,842 --> 00:29:52,467
See, dance is something you learn
with discipline, which you lack.

392
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:54,467
Please leave.

393
00:29:56,009 --> 00:29:57,050
Greetings, Guru ji!

394
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:59,133
Greetings...

395
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,133
Please sit...

396
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:06,425
Father, these 10 specimen are
unable to learn how to dance...

397
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:09,717
They are of no use, beyond hindering
the reputation of our school.

398
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,929
Which is why I've decided
to send them back home.

399
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:15,259
Hmm... What else?

400
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,926
If you'd let us know who is up
for their Debut Performance,

401
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:19,425
we'll take care of the arrangements.

402
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:25,133
This time.

403
00:30:26,717 --> 00:30:27,717
Give it to Vaishnavi...

404
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Guru ji!

405
00:30:36,259 --> 00:30:38,133
You said it would be my turn this time?

406
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,384
Not now.

407
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:40,592
Maybe later.

408
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:43,062
Can you tell me
where I'm lagging, at least?

409
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,467
It doesn't make any sense...

410
00:30:47,217 --> 00:30:48,217
Sitara...

411
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,592
you're very impatient.

412
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:51,801
Great things take time to happen...

413
00:30:52,175 --> 00:30:54,092
You still have a lot to learn.

414
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:58,092
What? It was you who said
I learn everything perfectly!

415
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,842
Performing is just a part of it,

416
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:02,172
you should also be able to teach
people how to dance.

417
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:05,592
Can you teach them how to dance?

418
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:12,509
OK, guruji... I'll teach them
and prove myself.

419
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:15,717
Shiva Shivaaya...

420
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:17,801
Excuse me.

421
00:31:17,968 --> 00:31:18,551
Sitara!

422
00:31:18,634 --> 00:31:20,342
Sitara! You don't need to worry at all!

423
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:23,676
I'm telling you, you're the best
dancer among everyone here!

424
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,342
Look, I'm very frustrated.
Don't annoy me...

425
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:29,509
You're such a short-tempered person...

426
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,050
Hey!

427
00:31:30,175 --> 00:31:31,815
Why can't youtry being calm for a change?

428
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:33,318
First of all, why do I even
need to speak with you?

429
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:35,151
You're not my friend,
neither are you a relative of mine...

430
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:36,717
You're not even a student here...

431
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:39,551
Yes...
I came here to join the dance school.

432
00:31:39,676 --> 00:31:40,592
What? You.

433
00:31:40,676 --> 00:31:41,717
Uh... No him...

434
00:31:41,801 --> 00:31:43,133
Not me... this guy.

435
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:45,592
Yeah... him!

436
00:31:46,133 --> 00:31:48,801
Yes. Me. I want to join here, sitara.

437
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,860
You guys are so confused...

438
00:31:50,884 --> 00:31:52,604
Just leave this place
if you're not serious.

439
00:31:52,676 --> 00:31:53,485
It's not like that Sitara...

440
00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:54,133
What's happening here?

441
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:57,300
These people are bothering sitara,
in the name of the dance school.

442
00:31:57,676 --> 00:32:00,133
You have to approach me
to learn dance, not her.

443
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,551
Uh... you guys just assigned
her to teach a batch right!

444
00:32:03,884 --> 00:32:07,217
If we learn along with them,
it'll be easier for all of us.

445
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:08,693
It's not acceptable. Please leave.

446
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:10,676
Sir! What happened?

447
00:32:11,342 --> 00:32:13,942
You're thinking about the easier
way out even before getting in...

448
00:32:14,133 --> 00:32:15,733
You don't have the right to learn dance.

449
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:19,009
Sir, stop being so defensive about it.

450
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:20,592
It's just dance, right?

451
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:22,676
I'll try to learn whatever I can...

452
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:24,384
How much fee do you charge?

453
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,009
I'll pay you in advance!

454
00:32:26,425 --> 00:32:28,634
You ignorant fool! Get out!

455
00:32:29,968 --> 00:32:30,968

456
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:32,968
Calm down.

458
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:36,884
Namaste sir!

459
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:37,926
My name's Rohit.

460

I came from Hyderabad.

461
00:32:39,092 --> 00:32:41,801
I want to learn dance from you, sir.

462
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:43,801
OK, learn.

463
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:45,610
Dad, if we just let random people learn,

464
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:47,314
the value of this craft
will be diminished.

465
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:51,467
If they learn well, the value of
the art will increase tenfold,

466
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:55,259
But no matter what,
the art will never go to waste.

467
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:58,092
Sitara, tomorrow's an auspicious day...

468
00:32:58,425 --> 00:33:00,509

to perform the pooja.

469

Thank you sir.

470
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:06,926
Hey, Sitara.

471
00:33:07,092 --> 00:33:08,092
Can we at least talk now?

472
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:11,467
Gangadhar,
check what items we need for the pooja.

473
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:15,634
Go and get your own items tomorrow.

474
00:33:43,425 --> 00:33:45,092
I got all the items you asked for.

475
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:49,551

Oh, do you need more time?

It's true though... We have to
practice a single step for one week.

get it right to save my life...

00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:05,217
Guru ji! If you perform something new,
by all means do it,

529
00:36:05,425 --> 00:36:07,425
Or give the rest of us a chance!

530
00:36:07,551 --> 00:36:08,551
Will you do It?

531
00:36:08,801 --> 00:36:10,009
No need to ask him...

532
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:13,009
I've been seeing those dances since
my brother was a ward member!

533
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:16,384
He went on to become a
sarpanch and is now the MLA!

534
00:36:16,634 --> 00:36:18,860
States are being divided and
even the government is changing...

535
00:36:18,884 --> 00:36:22,133
But there's no change to be
found yet in his dance!

536
00:36:22,592 --> 00:36:24,175
There's truth to what he said...

537
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:25,985
Would you consider doing
something new this time?

538
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:27,009
I apologise.

539
00:36:27,425 --> 00:36:29,009
I can only do what im capable of...

540
00:36:29,676 --> 00:36:31,801
I don't mind if you don't like it...

541
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:33,527
Let them have it if they wish...

542
00:36:33,551 --> 00:36:34,551
Stop right there.

543
00:36:37,217 --> 00:36:38,842
Greetings sir!

544
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:40,551
Greetings sir!

545
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,467
Greetings sir!

546
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:47,926
Guru ji is mourning the death of his wife,

547
00:36:48,842 --> 00:36:51,009
Let him have this satisfaction at least.

548
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:55,092
Not just that, till he's alive...

549
00:36:56,592 --> 00:36:57,759
He'll be doing it!

550
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,342
This...

551
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:01,467
Is my decision!

552
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:23,384
Even this time, we'll be doing the
Main performance thiskrishnashtami...

553
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,801
The entire responsibility
of that is now yours.

554
00:37:25,968 --> 00:37:26,968
I'm on it, Dad.

555
00:37:30,759 --> 00:37:32,399
Your performance needs to be much better.

556
00:37:33,576 --> 00:37:36,057
You go there and show me a concept.

557
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:37,937
Then I'll think about
your wild card entry.

558
00:37:39,842 --> 00:37:40,551
Guru ji!

559
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:42,300
I need a small help...

560
00:37:42,384 --> 00:37:44,509
There's a competition
I have to win at all costs!

561
00:37:44,634 --> 00:37:47,759
So, if you give me a cassette
from your collection...

562
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:51,217
I'll transform it to a western style!

563
00:37:51,384 --> 00:37:52,551
It'll surely be a big hit!

564
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:53,933
Alright.

565
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:56,384
Dad what is this?
You allowed him to learn...

566
00:37:56,425 --> 00:37:57,509
not to alter it!

567
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:59,009
You're mistaking me!

568
00:37:59,384 --> 00:38:01,509
I won't spoil its essence.
Just give it a makeover.

569
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:03,109
Who the hell do you think you are?

570
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:05,333
How dare you disrespect our
culture and look down on us?

571
00:38:05,676 --> 00:38:06,676
What gives you the right?

572
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:09,425
Why are you obsessed with these rights?

573
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:10,860
Why do we need to have these rights?

574
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:12,717
You do need it! For everything...

575
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:15,342
You need to be well
accomplished or well learnt...

576
00:38:15,509 --> 00:38:17,009
To have the right to speak about it!

577
00:38:17,717 --> 00:38:19,557
Have you even attended
a single class properly?

578
00:38:19,634 --> 00:38:22,717
OK, so what? I have to learn
the classes properly... right?

579
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:25,175
Not just learning... Mastering it!

580
00:38:25,384 --> 00:38:26,592
Okay. I'll do it.

581
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:27,717
Will you give me then?

582
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:35,592
If you have what it takes,
you will obtain what you work for.

583
00:38:36,592 --> 00:38:37,592
Go...

584
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:38,842
OK, Guru ji...

585
00:38:41,759 --> 00:38:42,926
Let's give him a chance.

586
00:38:46,801 --> 00:38:47,801
Sitara...

587
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:50,968
Take a look at this
casette and divide it...

588
00:38:51,175 --> 00:38:52,175
OK

589
00:38:53,884 --> 00:38:54,884
Sitara...

590
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:58,192
I've been observing you since many days,
you look a little gloomy.

591
00:38:58,467 --> 00:38:59,867
Is it about your debut performance?

592
00:39:03,009 --> 00:39:05,384
Sitara, don't worry.
In the upcoming performance...

593
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,634
Of Radha Gopala,
I'll give you the lead role.

594
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:09,318
Make sure you mesmerize everyone!

595
00:39:09,342 --> 00:39:10,842
Dad will definitely change his mind.

596
00:39:11,384 --> 00:39:14,592
Thank you very much for
understanding my position!

597
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:18,259
I'll definitely work hard and
make you and guru ji proud!

598
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:22,759
One more thing... Sitara...

599
00:39:23,009 --> 00:39:25,509
Did I say something wrong about Rohit?

600
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,759
No. What you said was correct.

601
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:31,092
He lacks the discipline
and commitment to learn.

602
00:39:32,926 --> 00:39:34,509
At-least you understood me well.

603
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:39,300
Those cassette's shouldn't
fall in Rohit's hands...

604
00:39:40,092 --> 00:39:44,676
For that...
Can you not complete his training?

605
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,384
Sit like this...

606
00:39:49,009 --> 00:39:50,133
1... 2...

607
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,133
1... 2... 3...

608
00:39:56,926 --> 00:39:59,133
Hey! How many times do I have to tell you?

609
00:39:59,551 --> 00:40:00,751
What do you think of yourself?

610
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:04,467
What are you doing?

611
00:40:04,926 --> 00:40:05,968
What are you both doing?

612
00:40:06,592 --> 00:40:07,872
Hand me that stick over there...

613
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:11,009
Hey... 1... 2... 3...

614
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,175
Stand erect.
Lift your leg up, like this...

615
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:15,050
Hey!

616
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:19,300
You can't even get one step right!

617
00:40:22,717 --> 00:40:23,884
Hey... Hey...

618
00:40:24,425 --> 00:40:25,717
Stop! What is this?

619
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:27,009
You overgrown manchild!

620
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,439
This looks more like
you're sweeping roads!

621
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:30,759
Are you drunk?

622
00:40:30,884 --> 00:40:32,384
I've been seeing you from 4 days...

623
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:34,217
There's absolutely no improvement in you.

624
00:40:34,592 --> 00:40:36,425
Do it all over again!

625
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,167
Gangadhar!

626
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:43,666
Where is everyone?

627
00:40:44,292 --> 00:40:46,375
Over there... they're playing something.

628
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:52,541
Hey...

629
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:55,624
What's all this?

630
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:56,417
Do you have sense?

631
00:40:56,583 --> 00:40:58,143
Why aren't you ready for your exam yet?

632
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,042
Guru ji will arrive at any moment now!

633
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,875
Because of you, I might lose my chance!

634
00:41:02,292 --> 00:41:03,372
Do the Wall-Chair position.

635
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:05,250
Count to 50 without moving.

636
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:05,809
Sitara...

637
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:06,375
If you move, it goes up to a 100.

638
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,020
What's with these punishments, Sitara?

639
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:08,791
I don't need to explain it to you.

640
00:41:08,958 --> 00:41:10,798
Don't try to give me
suggestions in everything.

641
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,125
Where are your anklets?

642
00:41:15,791 --> 00:41:17,143
I was in a hurry and it slipped my mind.

643
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:18,624
How are you so careless, Rohit?

644
00:41:18,791 --> 00:41:19,916
I'm not able to understand.

645
00:41:20,292 --> 00:41:23,292
Why are you getting so worked up
over such a small thing, Sitara?

646
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,958
OK, give me your anklets.

647
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:26,250
Give me my anklets.

648
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:27,892
One should maintain their
own set of anklets.

649
00:41:27,916 --> 00:41:28,916
Are you serious?

650
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:31,022
Does each set sound different
or something?

651
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Shut up!

652
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:39,466
The sound of these anklets
is like a weapon...

653
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,111
You must always be armed with it.

654
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,503
Similarly each person
should have their own pair.

655
00:41:44,167 --> 00:41:45,624
You go and get your anklets first.

656
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:47,708
Go!

657
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,875
Greetings, Guru ji!

658
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,083
Please sit.

659
00:41:58,417 --> 00:41:59,583
Greetings, Guru ji!

660
00:42:00,042 --> 00:42:01,042
Begin...

661
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,624
Everyone sit in "Aramandi' position."

662
00:42:08,333 --> 00:42:10,541
1... 2... 3...4

663
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:12,375
Four of you, come forward!

664
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:18,750
Good.

665
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:21,125
1... 2... 3...4

666
00:42:21,459 --> 00:42:23,583
1... 2... 3...4

667
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,333
It's nice.

668
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:33,958
I'm very pleased.

669
00:42:34,167 --> 00:42:35,583
Everyone did a great job!

670
00:42:36,042 --> 00:42:37,042
You've learn't well.

671
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,500
Well done.

672
00:42:41,516 --> 00:42:45,433
If you perform in front of 10 people,
it stops there.

673
00:42:45,725 --> 00:42:50,141
But, if you prepare 10 performers,
the art reaches many more souls.

674
00:42:50,558 --> 00:42:51,767
You taught them very well!

675
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:54,433
Guru ji!

676
00:42:55,725 --> 00:42:57,725
I taught them as I promised.

677
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,975
Will you let me perform for
'Kaadambari Katha' now?

678
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:01,808
Sitara, please stop this.

679
00:43:02,391 --> 00:43:04,100
Don't halt your debut performance.

680
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:06,151
You're not performing for
'Kaadambari katha'.

681
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:10,767
Even if this life ends.

682
00:44:11,308 --> 00:44:15,183
As a sacrifice for my art.

683
00:44:15,808 --> 00:44:19,850
This love has shed blood.

684
00:44:21,808 --> 00:44:23,308
What are you up to, Sitara?

685
00:44:23,642 --> 00:44:26,122
I have already told you,
not to perform the 'Kaadambari Katha'!

686
00:44:35,808 --> 00:44:40,017
Even if this life ends.

687
00:44:41,433 --> 00:44:45,475
As a sacrifice for my art.

688
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:49,350
"This love has shed blood.."

689
00:44:49,933 --> 00:44:52,333
I'm insisting you not to do it.
Why are you being so adamant?

690
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:56,141
As a child, you had promised me
I'd get to do "Kaadambari katha'"

691
00:44:56,364 --> 00:44:57,801
as my debut performance.

692
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:00,266
Wasn't that why I had learn
dance in the first place?

693
00:45:00,975 --> 00:45:04,100
How can I just do some other story?

694
00:45:05,767 --> 00:45:07,087
You were a child when I told you.

695
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,224
But, now I don't even remember the story!

696
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:12,100
I lost the book too.

697
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,433
I remember it, Guru ji!

698
00:45:14,725 --> 00:45:17,308
I can visualize every
single bit of that story!

699
00:45:17,933 --> 00:45:18,933
I'll tell it.

700
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,850
You just provide the requirements.

701
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:22,642
Sitara!

702
00:45:22,892 --> 00:45:24,183
Listen to me.

703
00:45:25,017 --> 00:45:26,892
- Leave it.
- Leave it?

704
00:45:28,391 --> 00:45:32,933
You can't leave something
that's chosen you.

705
00:45:33,642 --> 00:45:34,767
Please think about it once.

706
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:37,180
How did you come across
the diary in the first place?

707
00:45:37,475 --> 00:45:38,767
Why did you tell me?

708
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,017
Why am I not able to forget it?

709
00:45:41,308 --> 00:45:44,767
There must be a reason behind this.
Think about it, Guru ji!

710
00:45:45,183 --> 00:45:50,224
Kaadambari wants her story
to be told through us!

711
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:11,850
Today, if we are dancing...
It is because of Kaadambari.

712
00:46:30,642 --> 00:46:33,933
Guru ji has arrived.
- The dance troupe is also here.

713
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,808
Greetings, Guru ji!

714
00:46:38,391 --> 00:46:39,391
Come inside.

715
00:46:40,224 --> 00:46:42,266
This is a very special programme.

716
00:46:42,391 --> 00:46:43,725
They conduct it every year!

717
00:46:43,892 --> 00:46:45,433
Who does all these arrangements?

718
00:46:53,059 --> 00:46:54,516
The arrangements are done right?

719
00:46:54,808 --> 00:46:57,183
That dancer girl is here, dude!

720
00:46:57,224 --> 00:46:57,933
Yeah, brother!

721
00:46:57,975 --> 00:46:59,391
Designs are so great.

722
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:00,475
Hey dancer!

723
00:47:01,017 --> 00:47:05,141
Dancer girl, O dancer girl...
Will you dance with me?

724
00:47:05,642 --> 00:47:11,100
You make me feel alive, I just
need to have you for myself!

725
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,892
Shall I?

726
00:47:15,725 --> 00:47:17,245
You look like a loaded gun when angry!

727
00:47:22,224 --> 00:47:23,224
Make it fast!

728
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,391
Sister, she's ready!

729
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:27,035
I hope hari is ready...

730
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:28,059
Sitara!

731
00:47:31,933 --> 00:47:33,266
Everything fine?

732
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,391
Yes... everything is ready...

733
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:37,242
Call them when they're ready.
It's getting late.

734
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:38,266
OK.

735
00:47:42,183 --> 00:47:43,183
Sitara.

736
00:47:43,516 --> 00:47:45,558
I was afraid to let you
do the kaadambari katha,

737
00:47:45,725 --> 00:47:48,683
Because I was afraid it might harm you!

738
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,308
But, we can't stop now...

739
00:47:54,558 --> 00:47:56,308
People deserve to know
the Kaadambari Katha.

740
00:47:57,266 --> 00:47:58,725
People need to know the truth!

741
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,808
I've decided we'll complete
the tale together.

742
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:06,475
After today's performance,
I'll announce your debut on stange!

743
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:10,350
Shubham.

744
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:11,725
Thank you very much!

745
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:13,847
Let's do her debut performance
on this stage as well!

746
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,767
Sitara... Make sure I get that contract!

747
00:48:18,767 --> 00:48:20,850
Sir! The photo with you
and her was amazing!

748
00:48:21,475 --> 00:48:23,808
Sir! The photo with you
and her was amazing!

749
00:48:24,516 --> 00:48:26,933
You're the talk of the
town right now, trust me!

750
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:27,892
Really! Thanks to the almighty...

751
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:30,350
They're telling the Kaadambari katha,
again?

752
00:48:34,224 --> 00:48:36,308
Kaadambari katha?

753
00:48:37,183 --> 00:48:40,391
It's been 20 years so,
they might've forgotten about it.

754
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,224
Veerabhadra...

755
00:48:42,892 --> 00:48:45,017
I don't know what you're going to do.

756
00:48:45,266 --> 00:48:48,892
This performance needs to be stopped
and Guru ji needs to suffer for it!

757
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,725
Leave all this aside...

758
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:55,850
Kill that Sitara.

759
00:49:02,516 --> 00:49:03,516
Come on.

760
00:49:07,767 --> 00:49:08,767
Yes!

761
00:49:09,059 --> 00:49:12,183
See that. You got what you wanted
because you listened to me.

762
00:49:13,975 --> 00:49:16,266
But, this is still not enough...
There's a lot more to do.

763
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:18,435
The debut performance
should be more than perfect,

764
00:49:18,558 --> 00:49:20,798
because it's not just about you...
It's about me as well.

765
00:49:21,683 --> 00:49:23,600
I'm responsible for you guys, after all.

766
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,850
OK. OK... carry on.

767
00:49:29,725 --> 00:49:30,725
You did good.

768
00:49:31,017 --> 00:49:32,391
Moving him away from the exam.

769
00:49:32,808 --> 00:49:34,767
He's like a leech among us...

770
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,600
Very dangerous.

771
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,850
Especially for you.

772
00:49:52,642 --> 00:49:53,642
Hey!

773
00:49:53,683 --> 00:49:55,808
Guru ji is about to announce
my debut performance!

774
00:49:57,892 --> 00:49:59,017
Congratulations, Sitara!

775
00:49:59,059 --> 00:50:01,059
Yes, he'll announce it
after this performance...

776
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:03,059
Yeah, give me a minute.

777
00:50:04,308 --> 00:50:05,975
I'm getting my chance!

778
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:07,975
Congratulations teacher.

779
00:50:09,558 --> 00:50:10,558
Take this.

780
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:14,391
Rohit.

781
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:17,850
Aren't you happy for me?

782
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,993
Trampling on my efforts
and succeeding alone...

783
00:50:22,017 --> 00:50:24,266
Isn't real success!

784
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:29,933
Hey!

785
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:33,183
How dare you talk to me like that?

786
00:50:33,683 --> 00:50:35,224
This is how I talk.

787
00:50:36,017 --> 00:50:37,141
What are you, my friend?

788
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:38,224
A relative?

789
00:50:38,308 --> 00:50:39,516
Or my dance teacher?

790
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:41,433
Sitara...

791
00:50:43,183 --> 00:50:45,017
You can't accept your own mistakes,

792
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:46,642
and you're blaming it one me?

793
00:50:46,975 --> 00:50:50,183
Lacking dedication and discipline
is your mistake, not mine.

794
00:50:50,808 --> 00:50:53,725
Coming to class on time is
different from having dedication.

795
00:50:54,558 --> 00:50:55,059
Listen...

796
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:57,534
How can I stay here the whole month,
without any dedication?

797
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,642
Hey, you've just been here a month!

798
00:50:59,892 --> 00:51:01,433
We've been here for years!

799
00:51:02,224 --> 00:51:04,600
Do you know why I got the opportunity?

800
00:51:05,391 --> 00:51:07,975
Because I followed the rules properly!

801
00:51:08,183 --> 00:51:09,183
Hey, girls!

802
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,826
Have I ever been late to the class?

803
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,850
No, sister!

804
00:51:14,558 --> 00:51:15,975
That's my discipline.

805
00:51:16,475 --> 00:51:19,642
I've followed the footsteps of guru ji,
without straying from the path!

806
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:21,642
That's my dedication.

807
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:25,308
I've practised each step
for about 50,000 times.

808
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:28,683
That's my hard work.

809
00:51:30,391 --> 00:51:33,433
Because I was able to walk on this path,
while obeying the rules.

810
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,391
Now, I feel satisfied!

811
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,040
Sister! Hari sir is about to arrive,
let's practice till then.

812
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:40,266
Come sister.

813
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:41,516
Hey!

814
00:51:42,017 --> 00:51:42,475
Hey!

815
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:43,683
OK.

816
00:51:43,933 --> 00:51:47,767
You do the dance you've practised...
I'll do what I do best.

817
00:51:48,433 --> 00:51:50,433
Let's see whose performance is better.

818
00:51:50,725 --> 00:51:52,850
No way am I dancing next to you.

819
00:51:53,059 --> 00:51:54,059
What? Oh, you're scared?

820
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:58,558
- Gangadhar!
- Sister!

821
00:51:59,725 --> 00:52:01,183
Take Natuuvangam.

822
00:52:05,059 --> 00:52:06,224
Let's begin.

823
00:52:14,808 --> 00:52:19,725
Brundhavanilo yamuna thatilo
Nandanandnudi nagumomunakai.

824
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:23,183
Kshama sundaruni sangatyamukai.

825
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,017
Alasina Kanulatho.

826
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:27,017
Solisina thanuvutho.

827
00:52:28,975 --> 00:52:31,767
Virhasokamuna Hrudayam munigi.

828
00:52:31,808 --> 00:52:33,767
Vechivunna I radhani chusi.

829
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,391
Vanakusumale Vagachina vela.

830
00:52:36,475 --> 00:52:38,850
Vennela nisilo kalichin vela.

831
00:52:38,892 --> 00:52:41,017
Kilakila guvvalu kalavarapadutu.

832
00:52:41,059 --> 00:52:43,725
Vishada cgayalu alimina vela.

833
00:53:34,933 --> 00:53:37,516
Won't you look at me Madhava?

834
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:40,975
Why are you indifferent?
Why aren't you responding?

835
00:53:41,308 --> 00:53:43,808
Won't you come nearer and nearer to me?

836
00:53:44,017 --> 00:53:47,183
Enough of your mischief... naughty Krishna

837
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,308
I will show you the wonders of
this village, will you come?

838
00:53:50,475 --> 00:53:53,350
I was the one who showcased this
entire universe in my mouth.

839
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,516
If I offer you my cute girlish
beauty, will you come?

840
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:59,725
Brindavan is filled with
beauties which can outdo you.

841
00:53:59,975 --> 00:54:02,558
It's enough, don't look down on me.

842
00:54:02,975 --> 00:54:05,558
I am the girl who associated willingly.

843
00:54:05,889 --> 00:54:08,767
Why all these antics of
yours in my company?

844
00:54:08,975 --> 00:54:12,059
You won't be able to reach
this magician, Madhava anymore.

845
00:54:12,266 --> 00:54:14,475
Won't you look at me Madhava?

846
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:17,725
Why are you indifferent?
Why aren't you responding?

847
00:54:18,059 --> 00:54:20,642
Won't you come nearer and nearer to me?

848
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:24,224
Enough of your mischief... naughty Krishna.

849
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:06,308
Come, come Krishna... Radha Krishna.

850
00:55:06,475 --> 00:55:09,475
The milk, butter and
everything is yours dear.

851
00:55:09,558 --> 00:55:15,059
Get away Radha... all these
cows are owned by me.

852
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:18,224
Gopala! Shall I rhythmically
dance with you?

853
00:55:18,391 --> 00:55:21,642
I make the heaven and earth dance to
my tunes, you and I needn't dance.

854
00:55:21,725 --> 00:55:24,725
Gopala! I will build a dazzling,
shimmery temple for you.

855
00:55:24,808 --> 00:55:27,892
I am the one who lifted Govardhana
hill, I don't need temples.

856
00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:29,975
Won't you look at me Madhava?

857
00:55:30,141 --> 00:55:33,017
Why are you indifferent?
Why aren't you responding?

858
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:36,224
Won't you come nearer and nearer to me?

859
00:55:36,308 --> 00:55:39,558
Enough of your mischief... naughty Krishna.

860
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:03,516
Enough is enough then, don't come
near me, you will be insulted.

861
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:09,975
It is because of you that
this girl's heart is wounded.

862
00:56:10,558 --> 00:56:13,350
Don't try to trap me your
naughty naughty acts of magic.

863
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,642
Don't push this innocent
Radha away from you.

864
00:56:16,683 --> 00:56:22,100
Enough is enough then, don't come
near me, you will be insulted.

865
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:28,725
The direction for me
is the banks of Yamuna.

866
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:31,850
Enough is enough then, don't come
near me, you will be insulted.

867
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:35,475
You will never have Radha heart of love.

868
00:56:53,183 --> 00:56:58,266
There is no Madhava without Radha.

869
00:57:01,975 --> 00:57:06,600
Can he stay without Radha.

870
00:57:10,855 --> 00:57:17,082
Radha is the symbol of selfless love.

871
00:57:21,052 --> 00:57:25,830
This Krishna is always...

872
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:30,279
...a slave of such love.

873
00:57:33,002 --> 00:57:38,457
This Krishna is always
a slave of such love.

874
00:57:40,942 --> 00:57:46,516
This Krishna is always
a slave of such love.

875
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:16,892
Oh my god...

876
00:58:17,683 --> 00:58:19,767
Wow!

877
00:58:20,725 --> 00:58:22,183
Absolutely amazing!

878
00:58:22,516 --> 00:58:24,350
I expected to see something new,

879
00:58:24,892 --> 00:58:27,892
But what I've seen here is pure!

880
00:58:28,141 --> 00:58:29,475
Hey, what are you doing here?

881
00:58:29,558 --> 00:58:31,017
It's not how you think it is, sir.

882
00:58:31,683 --> 00:58:33,350
We're practising for the dance program.

883
00:58:33,475 --> 00:58:34,516
What's happening here?

884
00:58:34,558 --> 00:58:36,059
Oh Lord!

885
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:38,683
This girl took the
opportunity when you left...

886
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:41,391
and kissed some other guy.

887
00:58:41,892 --> 00:58:43,892
You need to be more careful, am I right?

888
00:58:44,975 --> 00:58:48,391
Oh God! I never thought
I'd humiliate you all!

889
00:58:48,683 --> 00:58:50,017
Just leave it, priest...

890
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,767
Being upset won't change
things in any way.

891
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,280
You portrayed dance
in such a horrible way!

892
00:58:55,516 --> 00:58:59,100
More than you, I need to blame
your guru who taught you all this!

893
00:59:00,224 --> 00:59:02,933
Look! Guru ji has nothing to do
with this... leave him out of this!

894
00:59:04,433 --> 00:59:07,600
He didn't do it personally...
but made these people do it!

895
00:59:08,224 --> 00:59:10,017
Such a clever fox, he is!

896
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:12,849
What's all this?

897
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:13,855
What happened?

898
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:15,076
Shastri ji! Look what's happening here...

899
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,975
They're altering the
history and portraying.

900
00:59:18,017 --> 00:59:19,642
Lord krishna in a disrespectful manner!

901
00:59:19,975 --> 00:59:22,141
We won't tolerate any
insult upon our lord!

902
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:22,975
We'll kill them!

903
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,391
Yes...

904
00:59:24,767 --> 00:59:29,100
You dorn the attire of Radha, and
behave so shamelessly?

905
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:30,600
Are you even a lady?

906
00:59:31,892 --> 00:59:32,892
Stop... Stop.

907
00:59:33,475 --> 00:59:35,266
Let's not squabble amongst ourselves...

908
00:59:35,516 --> 00:59:38,600
It's better we halt this performance.

909
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:40,600
Sire... I've invested a lot on this event!

910
00:59:40,767 --> 00:59:43,767
If you halt the event...
I'll be in a huge loss...

911
00:59:43,808 --> 00:59:45,808
You're concerned about your
personal monetary gain,

912
00:59:46,141 --> 00:59:48,850
while I'm thinking about the
reputation of this village!

913
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:51,725
Hey! Stop all this...

914
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:53,224
Stop everything.

915
00:59:53,433 --> 00:59:54,600
Sir... Sir...

916
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,100
Guru ji!

917
00:59:56,183 --> 00:59:57,975
Please do something and make it happen!

918
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,850
Let's go and talk to Shastri ji once...

919
01:00:01,475 --> 01:00:03,266
Finally, you got what you wanted!

920
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:06,642
What are you ogling at!
Drag her out of there!

921
01:00:07,475 --> 01:00:08,558
Go... Go!

922
01:00:09,017 --> 01:00:10,350
Send the rest away! Fast!

923
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:11,683
Let us talk first.

924
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,600
Hey!

925
01:00:13,933 --> 01:00:16,975
If he denies, we'll leave respectfully.

926
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:19,100
Who the hell are you to come in between?

927
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:21,618
Hey! This matter concerns
the reputation of the village!

928
01:00:21,642 --> 01:00:24,059
You already heard the man,
why are you still here?

929
01:00:24,183 --> 01:00:25,183
Send them away!

930
01:00:25,266 --> 01:00:26,767
Remove all.

931
01:00:31,808 --> 01:00:36,059
I'll sort this out right away...
if you give me that kiss.

932
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:47,011
Saw that?

933
01:00:47,350 --> 01:00:48,502
Have you?

934
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:51,391
I just asked her,
what made you insult the village and...

935
01:00:51,558 --> 01:00:52,558
She hit me!

936
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:54,252
Such people...

937
01:00:54,746 --> 01:01:00,573
They need to be taught a proper lesson!

938
01:01:00,898 --> 01:01:02,308
Yes... Yes.

939
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:04,176
You are the reason for this.

940
01:01:07,391 --> 01:01:08,767
Please understand...

941
01:01:09,224 --> 01:01:10,558
Please listen to me!

942
01:01:16,683 --> 01:01:17,975
Wait... Please wait.

943
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:22,391
Hey!

944
01:01:23,433 --> 01:01:24,433
Hey!

945
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,100
Let's go Sitara!

946
01:01:45,642 --> 01:01:46,725
Come on.

947
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,100
Let's go.

948
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,475
Let's go.

949
01:02:11,183 --> 01:02:12,850
Stop right there!

950
01:02:31,808 --> 01:02:32,850
Shastri ji!

951
01:02:32,892 --> 01:02:33,683
You need to understand,
why I'm telling this.

952
01:02:33,808 --> 01:02:34,968
They have broken the stage...

953
01:02:41,433 --> 01:02:43,350
Hey! Catch those buggers!

954
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:51,933
Sitara, Come!

955
01:02:55,683 --> 01:02:56,808
Catch them over there.

956
01:02:58,850 --> 01:02:59,850
Sitara, let's go...

957
01:03:00,017 --> 01:03:01,017
take care.

958
01:03:05,892 --> 01:03:07,017
Sitara, come fast!

959
01:03:07,308 --> 01:03:08,908
Don't just stand there, they'll kill us!

960
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:10,933
Come fast!

961
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:21,975
Damn!

962
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:25,059
I'll take care of them the next
time they set foot on this land.

963
01:03:38,558 --> 01:03:39,558
See that.

964
01:03:40,308 --> 01:03:42,933
That's what happens when you
mess with people's beliefs...

965
01:03:45,433 --> 01:03:47,808
A man doesn't submit to god...

966
01:03:48,516 --> 01:03:50,808
but to the belief of god!

967
01:03:51,475 --> 01:03:55,100
And even god himself can't
take it away from them...

968
01:03:55,308 --> 01:03:56,850
let alone, your dance!

969
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:31,929
Rohit.

970
01:04:32,178 --> 01:04:33,054
Anu, please...

971
01:04:33,178 --> 01:04:34,571
You need to be the one comforting her...

972
01:04:34,595 --> 01:04:35,971
Which is why I brought her here.

973
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:43,845
Sitara.

974
01:04:44,345 --> 01:04:45,345
Don't worry.

975
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,960
Wear a fresh pair of clothes...

976
01:04:48,595 --> 01:04:49,595
Here... take these.

977
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:52,178
That room, over there.

978
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:57,929
Take a right here...

979
01:04:58,054 --> 01:04:59,096
Stop it here...

980
01:05:04,054 --> 01:05:06,929
If I take her back now,
I'm afraid someone would harm her.

981
01:05:07,971 --> 01:05:09,262
Uncle, have some tea.

982
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:11,971
- Aunty...
- Thank you, dear...

983
01:05:12,262 --> 01:05:13,303
What are you studying?

984
01:05:13,971 --> 01:05:16,262
I'm pursuing my MBA in the
same college as Rohit.

985
01:05:16,971 --> 01:05:21,762
See, if you had listened to us,
you would've been studying like them.

986
01:05:22,096 --> 01:05:23,595
It's not the end of the world, uncle!

987
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:24,845
She can study even now...

988
01:05:25,303 --> 01:05:28,804
We can't even take her to our village,
how will she do her MBA?

989
01:05:28,887 --> 01:05:31,762
It's not a problem aunty!
Actually, join her in our college!

990
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:34,303
However, the admission
are open in two weeks...

991
01:05:34,387 --> 01:05:36,428
Till then, she can stay with me.

992
01:05:37,887 --> 01:05:39,262
That's actually a good idea.

993
01:05:40,012 --> 01:05:44,012
Sitara, you've pursued
what you wanted till now...

994
01:05:44,428 --> 01:05:46,054
It's time you listen to us.

995
01:05:46,595 --> 01:05:48,096
Stay here and study MBA.

996
01:05:48,845 --> 01:05:52,220
We'll send you all your
certificates and clothes.

997
01:05:53,762 --> 01:05:54,762
OK?

998
01:05:59,845 --> 01:06:01,178
- Give it to her.
- OK, aunty.

999
01:06:01,262 --> 01:06:02,822
I'll call you as soon as I reach there.

1000
01:06:04,595 --> 01:06:05,929
Greetings, guru ji.

1001
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:07,804
Yes, greetings.

1002
01:06:07,845 --> 01:06:09,512
- How is Sitara?
- She's doing good.

1003
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:11,804
She's staying at a friend of Revanth's.

1004
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:13,303
Good for her...

1005
01:06:13,637 --> 01:06:15,237
It's better she stays there for a while.

1006
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:18,720
We can bring her back once
things get sorted out.

1007
01:06:19,137 --> 01:06:20,137
No, sir.

1008
01:06:20,303 --> 01:06:23,971
She agreed to pursue MBA
and let go of dance.

1009
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:25,679
Leaving dance?

1010
01:06:26,096 --> 01:06:27,387
How have you agreed to it?

1011
01:06:27,929 --> 01:06:30,637
She became a laughing stock because
of her passion towards dance.

1012
01:06:31,595 --> 01:06:32,595
Leave her now...

1013
01:06:33,054 --> 01:06:35,220
Sitara was born to dance!

1014
01:06:35,929 --> 01:06:38,929
She is too gifted to just let go of it...

1015
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:39,887
Let me talk to her once...

1016
01:06:39,971 --> 01:06:41,559
Please wait! Don't call her.

1017
01:06:41,929 --> 01:06:43,845
You have lost your wife
because of this haste...

1018
01:06:47,178 --> 01:06:48,283
Pardon me.

1019
01:06:49,012 --> 01:06:50,372
We can't change what's happened...

1020
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:53,470
We are trying to give her
the best life she can have.

1021
01:06:53,804 --> 01:06:56,929
Please don't call her
till she's done with her studies.

1022
01:07:00,762 --> 01:07:01,762
OK madam.

1023
01:07:31,845 --> 01:07:32,845
Sitara.

1024
01:07:33,595 --> 01:07:35,072
Instead of staying cooped up in this room,

1025
01:07:35,096 --> 01:07:36,376
come join us in the dance class.

1026
01:07:41,137 --> 01:07:41,762
Hey, Dinakar.

1027
01:07:41,845 --> 01:07:42,637
- Hi, bro.
- How are you?

1028
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,720
All good.

1029
01:07:43,804 --> 01:07:44,220
Hey.

1030
01:07:44,804 --> 01:07:46,470
OK, Anu.
You both carry on.

1031
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:47,762
I'll quickly change and come.

1032
01:07:49,595 --> 01:07:50,595
Come!

1033
01:07:51,512 --> 01:07:52,762
Dude, you'll fall!

1034
01:07:52,929 --> 01:07:53,679
Hey guys!

1035
01:07:53,845 --> 01:07:55,012
Hey! Hi!

1036
01:07:56,345 --> 01:07:58,220
So, she's Sitara.

1037
01:07:58,595 --> 01:08:02,595
Oh... Sitara!

1038
01:08:05,096 --> 01:08:06,470
By the way, nice hairstyle!

1039
01:08:06,637 --> 01:08:08,096
But, you just have one tuft.

1040
01:08:08,428 --> 01:08:10,845
While I've got 4 of them!

1041
01:08:11,303 --> 01:08:13,054
I'll cut them off, if you don't shut up.

1042
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:16,470
Anyway, she's also a dancer.

1043
01:08:16,554 --> 01:08:17,595
Like... Classical.

1044
01:08:17,637 --> 01:08:18,637
Superb!

1045
01:08:18,762 --> 01:08:20,096
Wow! A Classical Dancer!

1046
01:08:20,428 --> 01:08:21,929
I'm a classical dancer as well!

1047
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:25,428
Baby... Classical dance doesn't mean...

1048
01:08:28,512 --> 01:08:30,887
All of that!
It's very classy!

1049
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:35,554
Oh my God, you're dress is so nice!

1050
01:08:35,762 --> 01:08:38,178
You're earrings are so pretty, so long!

1051
01:08:38,428 --> 01:08:39,679
You look so traditional!

1052
01:08:39,845 --> 01:08:41,765
By the way, have you done
your debut performance?

1053
01:08:41,971 --> 01:08:42,637
No!

1054
01:08:42,971 --> 01:08:44,096
I don't know how to dance!

1055
01:08:49,845 --> 01:08:50,845
Sitara!

1056
01:08:56,554 --> 01:08:57,554
What happened back there?

1057
01:08:58,345 --> 01:09:01,470
Rohit, I'm not able to do this...

1058
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:02,929
I don't like it here...

1059
01:09:03,470 --> 01:09:04,637

01:23:31,142 --> 01:23:32,142
Be careful, hari sir.

1229
01:23:32,184 --> 01:23:34,975
You don't want to repeat the
mistake you made the last time.

1230
01:23:42,267 --> 01:23:43,517
What is she troubling you?

1231
01:23:44,642 --> 01:23:45,642
I'll talk, this time.

1232
01:23:46,684 --> 01:23:47,684
No, hari.

1233
01:23:48,058 --> 01:23:49,058
Don't be hasty.

1234
01:23:49,267 --> 01:23:50,850
She did no wrong willingly.

1235
01:23:51,184 --> 01:23:52,264
A mistake just... happened.

1236
01:23:53,017 --> 01:23:54,808
Sitara is like our own family.

1237
01:23:55,559 --> 01:23:57,225
She might also be regretting it...

1238
01:23:57,933 --> 01:23:58,933
It's not that dad.

1239
01:23:59,475 --> 01:24:00,475
Not on the phone...

1240
01:24:00,808 --> 01:24:03,350
Meet her in person and try to talk to her.

1241

[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

1242
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:15,001
Hello.

1243
01:24:15,202 --> 01:24:16,202
Hello. Sitara!

1244
01:24:16,257 --> 01:24:17,893
This is Anushree speaking.
I'm Sitara's roommate.

1245
01:24:17,917 --> 01:24:19,167
Can you pass the phone to her?

1246
01:24:19,311 --> 01:24:21,631
Actually she isn't here right now
and her phone is with me.

1247
01:24:21,834 --> 01:24:23,959
Oh, I just arrived here to meet Sitara.

1248
01:24:24,376 --> 01:24:28,292
OK, you do one thing.
I'll send you the address of a coffee shop.

1249
01:24:28,542 --> 01:24:29,459
You wait there, she'll be coming over.

1250
01:24:29,542 --> 01:24:30,042
OK...

1251
01:24:30,126 --> 01:24:30,542
is it OK...

1252
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:31,001
OK

1253
01:24:31,126 --> 01:24:32,376
You can meet her.

1254
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,292
OK bye.

1255
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:34,459
Sure.

1256
01:24:35,334 --> 01:24:36,750
Dude, how much longer?

1257
01:24:36,792 --> 01:24:38,750
Sitara and all will be here, anytime!

1258
01:24:38,834 --> 01:24:40,875
Why can't you people get
things done on time!

1259
01:24:40,917 --> 01:24:41,667
Make it quick.

1260
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:42,500
Stay on hold.

1261
01:24:42,875 --> 01:24:44,750
Hey, you're hari right?

1262
01:24:45,042 --> 01:24:46,167
Yeah, how do you know?

1263
01:24:46,334 --> 01:24:47,851
I was the one you spoke with on phone.

1264
01:24:47,875 --> 01:24:49,084
I sent you the address, right?

1265
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,448
Yeah, that part's fine,
but how do you know me by my name?

1266
01:24:52,251 --> 01:24:55,917
Come on yaar! Nobody from here
dresses up so traditionally!

1267
01:24:59,126 --> 01:25:00,251
OK, but where is Sitara?

1268
01:25:00,625 --> 01:25:02,126
You're right on time! Come.

1269
01:25:05,959 --> 01:25:06,959
Is the cake ready?

1270
01:25:07,251 --> 01:25:08,292
Please make it fast.

1271
01:25:08,583 --> 01:25:10,667
Guys, Guys, Guys.
They'll be here any minute!

1272
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:11,251
Give it here.

1273
01:25:11,292 --> 01:25:12,917
Everybody, stick to the plan!

1274
01:25:13,042 --> 01:25:14,959
No one should forget.

1275
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:18,750
They're here, now go! Hide somewhere.

1276
01:25:18,917 --> 01:25:19,959
Hari! Hide! Get down.

1277
01:25:20,042 --> 01:25:21,459
Quickly! Come come come.

1278
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:24,834
Shh! We're giving a surprise to Sitara!

1279
01:25:25,126 --> 01:25:25,750
She's coming.

1280
01:25:25,834 --> 01:25:26,750
Where are we going?

1281
01:25:26,834 --> 01:25:28,209
I'll tell you, wait.

1282
01:25:28,334 --> 01:25:29,334
You'll see for yourself.

1283
01:25:30,042 --> 01:25:32,209
Surprise!

1284
01:25:33,084 --> 01:25:34,251
Happy birthday!

1285
01:25:34,459 --> 01:25:36,334
Woohoo!

1286
01:25:37,001 --> 01:25:38,209
Happy birthday to you!

1287
01:25:38,251 --> 01:25:38,959
Thank you.

1288
01:25:39,001 --> 01:25:40,459
Happy birthday.

1289
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:45,126
Happy birthday to you, Sitara!

1290
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:46,583
Hari sir?

1291
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:48,917
How come, you're here?

1292
01:25:49,209 --> 01:25:50,709
It's your birthday, right?

1293
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:52,418
That's why he came!

1294
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:54,875
OK, guys. Come.

1295
01:25:55,157 --> 01:25:56,380
Let's have the cake. Come on.

1296
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:57,792
Come on. Come.

1297
01:25:59,376 --> 01:26:01,459
Woohoo.

1298
01:26:05,667 --> 01:26:07,959
Happy birthday to you!

1299
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:10,500
Happy birthday, Dear Sitara!

1300
01:26:10,709 --> 01:26:13,583
Happy birthday, Dear Sitara! Woohoo.

1301
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:19,209
Hair sir.

1302
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:22,792
Thank you so much for coming to visit.

1303
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:28,251
I had some work here... just wanted
to drop by and see how you're doing.

1304
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:31,792
Guys, I have some good news.

1305
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:34,376
The judge really liked the video we sent.

1306
01:26:34,667 --> 01:26:36,542
We're selected for the US Competition!

1307
01:26:36,667 --> 01:26:38,001
We're flying to New York!

1308
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:39,542
Woohoo!

1309
01:26:41,418 --> 01:26:42,418
Yes!

1310
01:26:43,084 --> 01:26:44,084
We did it!

1311
01:26:48,209 --> 01:26:49,209
We did it!

1312
01:26:50,042 --> 01:26:50,583
Guys!

1313
01:26:50,750 --> 01:26:53,084
Rohit, we must tell this to hari sir!

1314
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,709
Guru ji will be very pleased
to know about this!

1315
01:26:56,001 --> 01:26:58,459
Yeah. Our team got selected
for the US Dance competition.

1316
01:26:58,667 --> 01:26:59,875
We're flying to America!

1317
01:27:00,042 --> 01:27:00,834
Downtown!

1318
01:27:00,917 --> 01:27:02,583
Front page in the New York Magazine!

1319
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,834
We're gonna rock!

1320
01:27:04,084 --> 01:27:07,709
Do you know, we're taking your Kaadambari
Katha to the International level!

1321
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:09,209
Guess who did the choreography?

1322
01:27:09,292 --> 01:27:10,292
Sitara!

1323
01:27:10,917 --> 01:27:11,917
Is the date fixed?

1324
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:13,750
Yeah bro. 10th of the next month.

1325
01:27:14,251 --> 01:27:15,251
Cool bro.

1326
01:27:15,542 --> 01:27:16,084
Really?

1327
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,750
We don't have enough time!

1328
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:18,834
No problem, we'll rock!

1329
01:27:18,875 --> 01:27:20,542
Sitara, I'll be leaving.

1330
01:27:21,042 --> 01:27:22,042
I have some work.

1331
01:27:26,917 --> 01:27:28,750
Thank you very much for visiting,
Hari sir.

1332
01:27:28,875 --> 01:27:30,334
I'm feeling very happy.

1333
01:27:33,601 --> 01:27:39,959
I want to come back to our village
and apologize to Guru ji...

1334
01:27:40,434 --> 01:27:42,418
You need to help me...

1335
01:27:43,822 --> 01:27:45,917
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1336
01:27:49,917 --> 01:27:54,418
Nobody's liking my performances,
but Sitara's taking her dance to America.

1337
01:27:54,926 --> 01:27:56,401
According to the calendar,

1338
01:27:56,425 --> 01:27:58,592
the most auspicious date
to conduct the festival...

1339
01:27:58,842 --> 01:28:02,051
in our temple is, 10th and
16th of the next month.

1340
01:28:02,493 --> 01:28:06,092
Which date among them should we fix?

1341
01:28:06,926 --> 01:28:13,259
10th seems to be very less time to
prepare all the arrangements...

1342
01:28:13,509 --> 01:28:17,300
I guess,
we should go for 16th as the date.

1343
01:28:17,467 --> 01:28:18,717
Not 16th, let's do it on 10th!

1344
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:23,592
Let's conduct the festival
on the 10th of next month.

1345
01:28:23,884 --> 01:28:26,204
Because that was the day, the
temple gates were reopened...

1346
01:28:26,842 --> 01:28:28,383
and we got our sacred texts back!

1347
01:28:28,717 --> 01:28:31,842
Hopefully, we'll get our god's
blessings if we do it on that day.

1348
01:28:31,926 --> 01:28:32,618
Auspicious!

1349
01:28:32,818 --> 01:28:33,818
That's nice to hear.

1350
01:28:34,051 --> 01:28:35,383
So, it's settled then.

1351
01:28:35,592 --> 01:28:38,009
We'll also get the favour of gods!

1352
01:28:38,509 --> 01:28:39,589
OK, let's plan accordingly.

1353
01:28:39,717 --> 01:28:40,717
Shubham!

1354
01:28:42,592 --> 01:28:43,218
Yeah... that's fine...

1355
01:28:43,383 --> 01:28:43,842
Sitara!

1356
01:28:44,009 --> 01:28:45,009
Pack this.

1357
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:48,759
Hari sir!

1358
01:28:49,092 --> 01:28:51,717
Sitara... I've found a way
to get you back here.

1359
01:28:52,134 --> 01:28:53,801
- Really?
- Yes, Sitara.

1360
01:28:54,383 --> 01:28:58,009
You coming to our village, Guru ji
forgiving you... Everything will happen.

1361
01:28:58,134 --> 01:28:59,634
But how, hari sir?

1362
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:02,207
I'll be performing during this
year's temple festivities.

1363
01:29:02,675 --> 01:29:06,550
Instead of doing something I want,
I thought we'd do the 'Kadambari Katha'.

1364
01:29:07,383 --> 01:29:09,717
I'll safely escort you till the stage,
don't worry.

1365
01:29:10,176 --> 01:29:13,342
Once the performance begins,
nobody would stop us.

1366
01:29:13,634 --> 01:29:15,794
You can fascinate everyone
out there with your dance...

1367
01:29:16,176 --> 01:29:17,884
and prove them wrong about you.

1368
01:29:18,467 --> 01:29:19,592
I'll stand with you.

1369
01:29:20,717 --> 01:29:22,801
I'll make sure everyone forgives you.

1370
01:29:23,134 --> 01:29:26,176
I'm very excited upon
hearing this from you.

1371
01:29:26,592 --> 01:29:29,550
This day, is not too far from now, Sitara.

1372
01:29:30,884 --> 01:29:33,244
We're conducting our festivities,
on the 10th of next month.

1373
01:29:33,592 --> 01:29:35,218
10th?

1374
01:29:35,467 --> 01:29:36,467
Yes, what's wrong?

1375
01:29:36,509 --> 01:29:38,801
I'll be going to America
on that day sir...

1376
01:29:39,092 --> 01:29:40,652
This is your last chance at redemption,

1377
01:29:41,134 --> 01:29:43,383
we can't do much if you let it slip.

1378
01:29:45,926 --> 01:29:49,009
What? Are you lost for words
because of how grateful you are?

1379
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:51,342
Rohit stood by me when
everyone let me down...

1380
01:29:52,134 --> 01:29:55,884
I can't just leave him when he needs me.

1381
01:29:56,383 --> 01:29:57,801
Please forgive me.

1382
01:29:58,842 --> 01:30:00,550
You're so stubborn! Your wish.

1383
01:30:08,425 --> 01:30:09,759
Hey. What happened?

1384
01:30:11,009 --> 01:30:12,329
- Nothing.
- Everything all right?

1385
01:30:12,717 --> 01:30:13,717
Sure?

1386
01:30:15,218 --> 01:30:16,467
Hey, did you know this?

1387
01:30:16,634 --> 01:30:19,218
Sitara will be performing in the US.

1388
01:30:19,550 --> 01:30:21,218
Entirely choreographed by her!

1389
01:30:21,259 --> 01:30:22,259
Really great, right?

1390
01:30:22,383 --> 01:30:23,717
Performing in the US.

1391
01:30:23,842 --> 01:30:25,042
Entirely choreographed by her!

1392
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:32,592
Do I do it again?

1393
01:30:32,634 --> 01:30:34,235
You'll have to do it the
third time as well.

1394
01:30:34,259 --> 01:30:35,634
Third time as well?

1395
01:30:36,842 --> 01:30:37,842
OK

1396
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:42,592
What happened, hari sir?

1397
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:44,342
Nothing... you continue.

1398
01:30:47,759 --> 01:30:48,759
Guys, look here.

1399
01:30:49,176 --> 01:30:50,550
We got the passports.

1400
01:30:50,592 --> 01:30:52,383
Woohoo!

1401
01:31:09,383 --> 01:31:10,592
Today is the 10th.

1402
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,863
Sitara will be on her way to America.

1403
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:15,009
I have to dance in the temple festivities.

1404
01:31:15,259 --> 01:31:18,342
If something goes wrong and
the people dislike it...

1405
01:31:19,009 --> 01:31:21,259
It would've been nice
to have Sitara here...

1406
01:31:22,509 --> 01:31:23,592
I still have time.

1407
01:31:24,051 --> 01:31:25,801
I need to get her back!

1408
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,926
It's getting late, make it fast.

1409
01:31:31,905 --> 01:31:33,434
[MOBILE RINGING]

1410
01:31:34,342 --> 01:31:35,372
Catch these. Someone is calling me.

1411
01:31:35,396 --> 01:31:36,396
Careful.

1412
01:31:37,801 --> 01:31:40,300
Oh God! I still have to pack all these...

1413
01:31:40,717 --> 01:31:41,717
Hey, Sitara!

1414
01:31:42,634 --> 01:31:46,383
I should've been more patient, I'm sorry.

1415
01:31:47,592 --> 01:31:49,425
So, when are you leaving today?

1416
01:31:50,675 --> 01:31:51,926
3:00 a.m. early morning.

1417
01:31:52,634 --> 01:31:54,550
You were truly blessed!

1418
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:56,218
Our performance is at 7:00.

1419
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:59,443
If you leave as soon as the performance
is finished, you can make it on time.

1420
01:31:59,467 --> 01:32:01,110
I'll personally see
you off to the airport.

1421
01:32:01,134 --> 01:32:01,759
Really?

1422
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:05,842
I've been waiting since forever
for Guru ji's blessing!

1423
01:32:06,634 --> 01:32:08,092
I'll definitely come!

1424
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:09,731
OK.

1425
01:32:10,641 --> 01:32:11,814
[CHUCKLES] Rohit!

1426
01:32:11,939 --> 01:32:12,939
What?

1427
01:32:14,355 --> 01:32:17,063
I'm going to go back to
the village and perform!

1428
01:32:18,147 --> 01:32:19,147
OK...

1429
01:32:19,564 --> 01:32:22,439
That's... That's great. But how?

1430
01:32:22,606 --> 01:32:23,939
How did this miracle happen?

1431
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:26,189
- Guru ji?
- No, Hari sir.

1432
01:32:26,731 --> 01:32:27,731
Hari?

1433
01:32:27,779 --> 01:32:28,779
Yes.

1434
01:32:34,939 --> 01:32:36,579
The temple festivities happen every year!

1435
01:32:36,814 --> 01:32:39,189
He planned for us to do
a performance together!

1436
01:32:39,481 --> 01:32:40,772
He'll even send a video!

1437
01:32:40,939 --> 01:32:43,039
I Just have to go in,
do the performance and come back!

1438
01:32:43,063 --> 01:32:46,814
Rohit, the people there,
Guru ji, will accept me right?

1439
01:32:47,397 --> 01:32:50,606
What acceptance?
Have you forgotten what happened?

1440
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:51,898
Pack this.

1441
01:32:52,564 --> 01:32:53,939
Please understand.

1442
01:32:54,397 --> 01:32:56,939
I'll do the performance and come!
Please...

1443
01:32:57,814 --> 01:32:59,564
OK, when is this?

1444
01:32:59,898 --> 01:33:00,898
Tonight, 7 p.m.

1445
01:33:01,647 --> 01:33:02,647
What?

1446
01:33:02,939 --> 01:33:04,105
What? Today?

1447
01:33:04,564 --> 01:33:05,243
Yes...

1448
01:33:05,443 --> 01:33:06,689
Have you completely lost it?

1449
01:33:06,898 --> 01:33:09,230
How can you even think that
when we have a flight tonight?

1450
01:33:09,447 --> 01:33:10,447
Have you lost your mind?

1451
01:33:10,581 --> 01:33:12,566
Erasing Borders... New York. Contract?

1452
01:33:13,222 --> 01:33:14,431
Have I told you I won't come?

1453
01:33:14,847 --> 01:33:15,972
The program is at 7...

1454
01:33:16,598 --> 01:33:18,556
I'll come back on time
to catch the flight!

1455
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:23,014
Yeah, because the people there
will welcome you with open arms,

1456
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:27,722
and let you leave whenever you please!

1457
01:33:27,847 --> 01:33:29,615
Hell no. They'll kill you
right then and there.

1458
01:33:29,639 --> 01:33:30,805
Please, let me go!

1459
01:33:30,889 --> 01:33:31,514
Enough, Sitara!

1460
01:33:31,639 --> 01:33:32,639
Stop this now.

1461
01:33:33,155 --> 01:33:35,556
I'll not allow you to go back, that's it.

1462
01:33:50,972 --> 01:33:51,972
Sitara...

1463
01:33:52,722 --> 01:33:54,181
Do you really need to go?

1464
01:33:55,509 --> 01:33:56,889
How can you be so selfish?

1465
01:33:57,223 --> 01:34:00,553
Who is being selfish here?
I always think about the both of us.

1466
01:34:00,753 --> 01:34:02,633
But you're the one just
thinking about yourself.

1467
01:34:03,014 --> 01:34:04,222
I'll be on time, don't worry.

1468
01:34:08,504 --> 01:34:10,055
Guys, I don't know how...

1469
01:34:10,650 --> 01:34:12,805
At any circumstance,
we're going to the US.

1470
01:34:13,014 --> 01:34:14,389
- OK?
- OK...

1471
01:34:14,847 --> 01:34:17,222
Shreya. If Sitara isn't coming,
you'll be replacing her.

1472
01:34:17,514 --> 01:34:18,514
OK, I'll do it.

1473
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:20,347
OK, guys. Let's finish the packing.

1474
01:34:30,182 --> 01:34:30,901
Mom!

1475
01:34:31,075 --> 01:34:31,653
Yes, dear...

1476
01:34:31,853 --> 01:34:33,823
Have you finished all the
arrangements to go to America?

1477
01:34:33,847 --> 01:34:36,139
No, mom.
I'm coming to the village.

1478
01:34:36,306 --> 01:34:38,306
To perform at the temple festivities.

1479
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:40,222
What? Coming to the village?

1480
01:34:40,472 --> 01:34:42,805
These people will kill you on sight!

1481
01:34:43,306 --> 01:34:44,472
Nothing will happen, mom.

1482
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:46,763
Hari sir told me he'd
take care of everything.

1483
01:34:47,097 --> 01:34:48,639
Don't be crazy, Sitara!

1484
01:34:49,222 --> 01:34:50,847
I can't explain it to you, mum.

1485
01:34:51,763 --> 01:34:53,514
I'll talk to you later, bye.

1486
01:34:54,266 --> 01:34:55,266
Sitara!

1487
01:35:17,722 --> 01:35:18,763
Nobody saw you, right?

1488
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:21,889
Nobody did. But why did
you make me come here?

1489
01:35:23,055 --> 01:35:25,198
Everyone would be alert,
if you came right into the village.

1490
01:35:25,222 --> 01:35:27,181
Nothing will go wrong, right sir?

1491
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,532
Most importantly, I have to
reach the airport on time.

1492
01:35:29,556 --> 01:35:32,431
Sitara. I'll take care of it,
you don't have to worry.

1493
01:37:08,514 --> 01:37:10,055
Everyone, step outside for a moment.

1494
01:37:36,472 --> 01:37:37,472
Sitara.

1495
01:37:38,598 --> 01:37:41,264
See, I've kept my word.

1496
01:37:42,722 --> 01:37:44,181
Can anyone else do this?

1497
01:37:44,472 --> 01:37:46,181
I'll reach the airport on time, right?

1498
01:37:50,181 --> 01:37:53,639
Sitara... Concentrate on
the performance first.

1499
01:37:54,598 --> 01:37:54,930
OK.

1500
01:37:55,431 --> 01:37:56,598
Yes, OK.

1501
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:16,389
Greetings guruji.

1502
01:38:18,306 --> 01:38:19,556
Hari sir! Guru ji is here!

1503
01:38:25,055 --> 01:38:29,014
Sitara, get ready to change your life!

1504
01:38:29,181 --> 01:38:32,222
The people, Guru ji!
They'll immerse you in praise.

1505
01:38:35,097 --> 01:38:37,722
You always wanted to play
the role of a host, right?

1506
01:38:37,972 --> 01:38:38,972
Yes.

1507
01:38:39,306 --> 01:38:40,639
Will you play my host?

1508
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:43,639
Well, of course! If guru ji
will accept me, then surely!

1509
01:38:44,930 --> 01:38:48,139
Sitara. I don't think you
understand what I mean...

1510
01:38:49,014 --> 01:38:51,181
Will you be my host!

1511
01:38:52,556 --> 01:38:55,763
Not just my host, but my life-partner.

1512
01:38:58,472 --> 01:38:59,805
I want to marry you.

1513
01:39:00,431 --> 01:39:01,930
Hari sir, please forgive me.

1514
01:39:02,514 --> 01:39:04,264
I never thought of you like that.

1515
01:39:06,055 --> 01:39:08,598
Then who will be more suited? That Rohit?

1516
01:39:09,639 --> 01:39:12,559
I'm over her risking it all for you,
while you're thinking about that guy?

1517
01:39:12,805 --> 01:39:14,930
Isn't it because of him,
that all of this happened?

1518
01:39:15,181 --> 01:39:18,181
It's not his fault, sir.
Whatever he did, was for me.

1519
01:39:18,472 --> 01:39:19,472
What did he do?

1520
01:39:19,763 --> 01:39:21,240
He destroyed the only dream
you grew up to achieve.

1521
01:39:21,264 --> 01:39:22,264
He insulted guru ji!

1522
01:39:22,514 --> 01:39:23,674
Brought shame upon all of us!

1523
01:39:24,014 --> 01:39:27,222
Despite all that, I risked my
life to get you all the way here!

1524
01:39:29,055 --> 01:39:31,930
Tell me now! Me or him?

1525
01:39:46,306 --> 01:39:47,514
Forgive me.

1526
01:39:55,097 --> 01:39:56,264
Sitara! Wait a minute.

1527
01:39:59,139 --> 01:40:02,389
I lost myself there,
let's focus on the performance first.

1528
01:40:05,014 --> 01:40:07,763
The announcement is already
done, don't overthink it.

1529
01:40:09,639 --> 01:40:14,222
We enjoyed 'Natya Mayuri Kala Brundham's
amazing performance.

1530
01:40:14,389 --> 01:40:18,431
Up next, we have Vidyalaya Natya
Kala Brundham's performance.

1531
01:40:18,763 --> 01:40:25,222
Their performances are always
magical and captivating!

1532
01:40:25,556 --> 01:40:33,014
But, this year, Guru ji's son, Hari, is
on a quest to carry his father's legacy!

1533
01:40:33,097 --> 01:40:38,264
Let's see what they have
choreographed for us!

1534
01:40:38,763 --> 01:40:41,805
We hope this performance
will be beyond expectations!

1535
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:45,639
Let's welcome them on stage.

1536
01:40:46,722 --> 01:40:48,431
How dare you reject me...

1537
01:40:48,847 --> 01:40:51,222
I'll make sure you'll never set
foot in this village again.

1538
01:41:11,864 --> 01:41:13,036
Catch her now!

1539
01:41:34,067 --> 01:41:35,722
Sitara... what are you doing here?

1540
01:41:36,055 --> 01:41:37,472
Our performance is in due time...

1541
01:41:38,763 --> 01:41:40,222
See, everyone's waiting.

1542
01:41:41,081 --> 01:41:42,641
Please get down from the stage, Sitara.

1543
01:41:43,346 --> 01:41:46,181
Where can you go? Look at them,
waiting to gobble you up.

1544
01:41:47,426 --> 01:41:51,014
You won't even cross this village,
let alone reach the airport.

1545
01:41:51,639 --> 01:41:52,755
Sitara,

1546
01:41:53,633 --> 01:41:56,020
I'm telling you... Please go!

1547
01:41:57,969 --> 01:42:03,722
I won't leave this stage
untill Guru ji forgives me!

1548
01:42:09,635 --> 01:42:10,635
See that!

1549
01:42:11,625 --> 01:42:13,465
That's what I've been
trying to tell you all...

1550
01:42:13,728 --> 01:42:16,437
One dancer's mistake shouldn't hinder
the whole school's reputation...

1551
01:42:16,461 --> 01:42:19,990
Look at her now, she wants to perform
on behalf of our school and...

1552
01:42:20,111 --> 01:42:21,768
earn laurels!

1553
01:42:22,084 --> 01:42:24,097
Tell me! What should I do?

1554
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:26,347
Leave, Sitara!

1555
01:42:26,472 --> 01:42:27,472
Get down!

1556
01:42:28,847 --> 01:42:30,014
Sitara, get down.

1557
01:42:30,055 --> 01:42:31,264
These aren't good men.

1558
01:42:35,972 --> 01:42:38,306
You have infected this
village like a plague!

1559
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:40,399
Why have you come back?
To insult us further?

1560
01:42:58,722 --> 01:42:59,847
Leave!

1561
01:43:00,139 --> 01:43:01,139
Leave!

1562
01:43:01,347 --> 01:43:02,347
Leave!

1563
01:43:02,722 --> 01:43:03,722
Leave!

1564
01:43:04,097 --> 01:43:05,097
Leave!

1565
01:43:05,722 --> 01:43:06,722
Leave!

1566
01:43:15,598 --> 01:43:16,598
Leave!

1567
01:43:16,930 --> 01:43:17,930
Leave!

1568
01:43:18,181 --> 01:43:19,181
Leave!

1569
01:43:23,598 --> 01:43:27,930
Hey, it's OK. It's me, Rohit.

1570
01:43:28,431 --> 01:43:29,431
Rohit!

1571
01:43:29,473 --> 01:43:31,153
Nothing will happen to you...
I'm here now.

1572
01:43:35,055 --> 01:43:36,889
It's OK, Sitara.

1573
01:43:36,930 --> 01:43:37,930
Sorry.

1574
01:43:38,097 --> 01:43:39,097
I'm here, now.

1575
01:43:41,055 --> 01:43:42,639
Hey! Sitara...

1576
01:43:43,306 --> 01:43:44,472
- Sorry...
- It's OK!

1577
01:43:44,598 --> 01:43:46,318
You tried to warn me,
but I didn't listen...

1578
01:43:46,972 --> 01:43:47,972
It's OK...

1579
01:43:48,972 --> 01:43:50,556
Wipe your tears.

1580
01:43:51,181 --> 01:43:52,598
What is it you want?

1581
01:43:52,722 --> 01:43:54,639
You seek Guru ji's forgiveness, right?

1582
01:43:55,139 --> 01:43:57,556
OK. Sitara... Listen to me.

1583
01:43:57,847 --> 01:43:59,930
It's time to prove yourself.

1584
01:44:00,306 --> 01:44:00,722
OK?

1585
01:44:01,097 --> 01:44:05,306
To these people, this guy and everyone.

1586
01:44:05,972 --> 01:44:06,972
OK?

1587
01:44:07,389 --> 01:44:12,347
Perform the 'Kadambari Katha',
right here... right now!

1588
01:44:17,014 --> 01:44:17,805
Let's go Sitara!

1589
01:44:17,967 --> 01:44:18,711
Come on!

1590
01:44:18,911 --> 01:44:19,911
Let's go guys.

1591
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,275
Wait... Just listen to me.

1592
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,901
Through our dance, we'll be
showcasing the story of your village!

1593
01:44:28,984 --> 01:44:31,234
Are you thinking, what do
we know about your village?

1594
01:44:31,901 --> 01:44:33,581
There's one story,
which none of you knows.

1595
01:44:36,234 --> 01:44:37,317
This is 'Kadambari Katha'

1596
01:44:37,943 --> 01:44:40,317
This is the Tale of Kaadambari.
The story of dance itself.

1597
01:44:52,270 --> 01:44:57,108
Just like Blossoming smiles
tuning into Swaras.

1598
01:44:57,484 --> 01:45:01,651
Just the way steps are
rhythmically tuned to Tala.

1599
01:45:07,859 --> 01:45:10,317
Just like bouncing waves.

1600
01:45:10,567 --> 01:45:12,734
The rhythm of heart beat has risen.

1601
01:45:13,108 --> 01:45:18,651
Piece of heart beat has sprinkled.

1602
01:45:25,734 --> 01:45:27,234
Sitdown everybody.

1603
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:29,984
Sitdown.

1604
01:45:42,817 --> 01:45:45,901
Their strength is their
tradition and culture!

1605
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,400
Their art unites them.

1606
01:45:50,150 --> 01:45:55,150
We need to destroy their
art, to establish our rule!

1607
01:45:55,817 --> 01:45:59,150
Let's appoint Francis to crush them!

1608
01:46:00,609 --> 01:46:02,901
British Honk attention.

1609
01:46:08,609 --> 01:46:14,859
Are these villagers jobless? They
are always into singing and dancing.

1610
01:46:15,359 --> 01:46:18,234
This is a mistake.

1611
01:46:18,692 --> 01:46:20,108
Here after, dance is banned.

1612
01:46:20,484 --> 01:46:22,359
Go and tell them in a way they understand.

1613
01:46:29,484 --> 01:46:32,567
I'm great Francis.

1614
01:46:32,984 --> 01:46:36,025
I work for country

1615
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:39,317
I'll even sacrifice my life

1616
01:46:39,776 --> 01:46:42,984
I'll ravage the enemies.

1617
01:46:43,192 --> 01:46:46,526
There might be many countries
in this world.

1618
01:46:46,734 --> 01:46:49,526
But none of them can
compete with the Bristish.

1619
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:53,400
It's an empire where the sun never sets.

1620
01:46:53,567 --> 01:46:56,901
The entire world is under us.

1621
01:47:03,317 --> 01:47:04,817
Warning...

1622
01:47:05,609 --> 01:47:06,901
Warning...

1623
01:47:07,317 --> 01:47:10,275
Your tantrums will no
longer be entertained.

1624
01:47:10,692 --> 01:47:13,150
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1625
01:47:14,108 --> 01:47:16,651
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1626
01:47:17,526 --> 01:47:20,025
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1627
01:47:20,943 --> 01:47:22,251
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1628
01:47:22,275 --> 01:47:24,192
They burnt them all! How cruel!

1629
01:47:24,234 --> 01:47:26,776
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1630
01:47:28,098 --> 01:47:30,442
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1631
01:47:31,192 --> 01:47:33,734
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1632
01:47:34,692 --> 01:47:37,317
It's a crime to dance henceforth.

1633
01:47:42,275 --> 01:47:44,651
Shut down this temple forever.

1634
01:48:30,862 --> 01:48:31,862
So sad...

1635
01:48:37,255 --> 01:48:38,255
Yes.

1636
01:48:38,449 --> 01:48:39,969
Why shouldn't I become a path to them?

1637
01:48:40,776 --> 01:48:43,442
I shall restore dance, its past glory.

1638
01:48:44,067 --> 01:48:46,526
I will write the future of dance.

1639
01:49:07,859 --> 01:49:09,984
It was written by Kaadambari.

1640
01:49:10,025 --> 01:49:10,651
Yes...

1641
01:49:10,859 --> 01:49:12,275
It was written by Kaadambari.

1642
01:49:25,317 --> 01:49:28,150
Yes... It was written by Kaadambari.

1643
01:49:36,901 --> 01:49:39,484
We thaught it was written God
but it was wrriten by Kaadhambari.

1644
01:49:39,567 --> 01:49:40,567
Yes...

1645
01:50:03,984 --> 01:50:06,734
This dance starts.

1646
01:50:06,817 --> 01:50:09,442
It's an offering to god.

1647
01:50:09,526 --> 01:50:12,359
The match is set between pitch and Dance.

1648
01:50:12,442 --> 01:50:15,025
For ultimate art begins here.

1649
01:50:15,317 --> 01:50:17,943
The earth itself has become the stage.

1650
01:50:17,984 --> 01:50:20,901
The sculptures have come forward as guests.

1651
01:50:20,943 --> 01:50:23,734
Mixing tempo in every step.

1652
01:50:23,776 --> 01:50:26,400
Feet is moving now.

1653
01:50:26,567 --> 01:50:29,400
The nature is blushing standing here.

1654
01:50:29,484 --> 01:50:32,067
It's a joy uttered by rhythm

1655
01:51:00,192 --> 01:51:00,943
who are you?

1656
01:51:01,108 --> 01:51:02,442
My name is Kaadambari.

1657
01:51:02,943 --> 01:51:05,359
Don't you know that dance
is illegal and shameful!

1658
01:51:05,484 --> 01:51:07,901
Do you know how pure dance is?

1659
01:51:08,234 --> 01:51:10,776
How dare you go against the law?

1660
01:51:10,859 --> 01:51:14,651
How dare you destroy our culture?

1661
01:51:20,108 --> 01:51:26,442
When the feet are dancing.

1662
01:51:26,734 --> 01:51:29,776
Will this nature not get delighted?

1663
01:51:29,901 --> 01:51:32,901
When she is tuning into our moves.

1664
01:51:33,651 --> 01:51:39,150
Our great culture and
tradition are prayer worthy.

1665
01:51:39,442 --> 01:51:45,859
If you watch it with your
heart, it'll touch your hearts.

1666
01:51:55,234 --> 01:51:57,234
Yes! That's what dance means. Amazing!

1667
01:51:57,484 --> 01:51:58,484
Super...

1668
01:51:59,692 --> 01:52:05,400
Francis was surprised to watch
to kadambari's dance greatness.

1669
01:52:05,776 --> 01:52:07,456
He realized that it was unfair on his part

1670
01:52:07,484 --> 01:52:09,484
and his countrymen's part to destroy dance

1671
01:52:09,776 --> 01:52:11,901
stood along with Kadambari to support her.

1672
01:52:12,526 --> 01:52:15,526
In that process, Francis
became close to Kadambari

1673
01:52:15,567 --> 01:52:17,047
and eventually fell in love with her.

1674
01:52:40,984 --> 01:52:47,317
Come with me, I'll show you a new world.

1675
01:52:48,150 --> 01:52:54,901
Come with me, I'll make you
the queen of the world.

1676
01:52:55,776 --> 01:53:02,192
Let's fly through the sky,
and glimpse the holy heaven.

1677
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:09,359
Let's touch the summit of happiness,
and twirl around the world.

1678
01:53:09,984 --> 01:53:16,234
Come with me, as the world awaits us.

1679
01:53:16,943 --> 01:53:23,734
Leave this world and let's journey love.

1680
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:30,692
Come with me, I'll show you
the wonders of this world.

1681
01:53:31,192 --> 01:53:37,817
Let's explore vivid natures
of dance around the world

1682
01:53:38,317 --> 01:53:44,859
and feast your eyes over many more visuals.

1683
01:53:45,442 --> 01:53:48,859
Come with me, as the universe awaits us.

1684
01:53:49,067 --> 01:53:52,108
Come with me, as the universe awaits us.

1685
01:53:52,971 --> 01:53:59,282
Leave this world and let's journey love.

1686
01:54:26,459 --> 01:54:33,234
Come with me, as the universe awaits us

1687
01:54:33,882 --> 01:54:40,730
leave this world and let's journey love.

1688
01:54:45,567 --> 01:54:47,943
How can you tolerate such obscenity!

1689
01:54:48,817 --> 01:54:50,400
Do something! Stop this!

1690
01:54:50,567 --> 01:54:52,692
Since Kaadambari agreed
to his love proposal,

1691
01:54:52,984 --> 01:54:55,776
Francis wanted to marry her
and take her to England.

1692
01:54:56,108 --> 01:54:58,502
But, Kaadambari told she
wouldn't leave the temple

1693
01:54:58,526 --> 01:55:01,692
until she completes
writing the sacred texts

1694
01:55:02,268 --> 01:55:07,734
Francis respected her resolve and
asked to marry her in this temple.

1695
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:11,734
All of this is false!
Absolutely fabricated!

1696
01:55:14,067 --> 01:55:17,651
Veerabhadra. Go and help Hari.

1697
01:55:23,484 --> 01:55:29,025
Kaadambari arrived at the temple in hopes
of getting married starting a new life.

1698
01:55:29,484 --> 01:55:36,234
But, the Britishers came to know of this,
surrounded the temple to end her life.

1699
01:55:47,442 --> 01:55:48,442
Veerabhadra!

1700
01:55:57,192 --> 01:56:00,084
Guru ji! You're crossing your limits.

1701
01:56:00,108 --> 01:56:01,108
Stop it!

1702
01:56:04,692 --> 01:56:06,067
Enough of your deception.

1703
01:56:07,269 --> 01:56:10,067
You changed the story of
our village to suit your need.

1704
01:56:11,526 --> 01:56:13,484
Kaadambari sacrificed for us all!

1705
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:16,359
It's not just an act.

1706
01:56:17,234 --> 01:56:19,817
But an effort to bring out the truth!

1707
01:56:21,234 --> 01:56:22,442
See there!

1708
01:56:54,734 --> 01:56:55,734
Kaadambari! Come.

1709
01:56:55,817 --> 01:56:58,234
They came to know about us.
We need to leave at once!

1710
01:56:58,734 --> 01:56:59,734
Stop!

1711
01:56:59,901 --> 01:57:02,400
If we leave,
these texts will be destroyed.

1712
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,859
And I won't let that happen.

1713
01:57:06,150 --> 01:57:08,067
It's OK, we can write it in England.

1714
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:11,192
There is no assurance to my
Art in your country, Francis.

1715
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:15,984
But, here. They'll stay safe inside the
temple no matter how many years pass.

1716
01:57:16,692 --> 01:57:18,692
You life is worth more than those texts!

1717
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,960
My life will cease to have any
meaning if I fail to protect them.

1718
01:57:37,484 --> 01:57:39,442
Kaadambari, please try to understand me!

1719
01:57:39,757 --> 01:57:40,943
How can I protect you!

1720
01:57:41,195 --> 01:57:43,442
Francis, there's no one to
protect these texts, but me.

1721
01:58:10,651 --> 01:58:14,234
Francis. There's only one way out of this.

1722
01:58:16,617 --> 01:58:17,712
My death.

1723
01:58:18,025 --> 01:58:19,192
Kill me, Francis.

1724
01:58:19,657 --> 01:58:20,984
What are you saying, Kaadambari?

1725
01:58:21,287 --> 01:58:22,047
Yes.

1726
01:58:22,247 --> 01:58:24,192
If you kill me, you won't be suspected.

1727
01:58:24,776 --> 01:58:25,984
And they'll trust you.

1728
01:58:26,984 --> 01:58:31,651
Before they discover these texts,
distract them and close the temple gates!

1729
01:58:32,275 --> 01:58:34,984
Only then, can these texts
be protected till eternity.

1730
01:58:37,526 --> 01:58:43,484
I must sacrifice myself,
for the sake of dance.

1731
01:59:10,192 --> 01:59:14,275
Even if this life ends.

1732
01:59:14,692 --> 01:59:18,651
As a sacrifice for my art.

1733
01:59:19,108 --> 01:59:23,067
This love has shed blood.

1734
01:59:23,567 --> 01:59:27,692
As devotion towards my art.

1735
01:59:27,943 --> 01:59:31,984
At every corner of my heart

1736
01:59:32,359 --> 01:59:36,359
I've held you as my breath.

1737
01:59:36,956 --> 01:59:40,859
Even for greater good.

1738
01:59:41,317 --> 01:59:45,526
Love needs to collapse.

1739
01:59:45,734 --> 01:59:49,943
How can I burn my heart in this fire

1740
01:59:50,192 --> 01:59:54,317
and bury my hopes with it?

1741
01:59:54,651 --> 01:59:58,692
On the scars of my broken heart.

1742
01:59:59,067 --> 02:00:03,275
The chariot of hopes need to move on.

1743
02:00:40,914 --> 02:00:44,817
Give art a reason to live

1744
02:00:45,192 --> 02:00:49,359
and bless it like a Samaritan.

1745
02:00:49,635 --> 02:00:53,692
Let my wish turn into poison

1746
02:00:54,067 --> 02:00:58,400
and grant me demise.

1747
02:00:58,943 --> 02:01:02,609
I'm like a dove with a broken wing.

1748
02:01:02,984 --> 02:01:07,067
So how can I fly to my destination?

1749
02:01:07,484 --> 02:01:11,567
And now my shattered heart, in rebirth

1750
02:01:11,859 --> 02:01:16,442
I vow to dedicate it to you

1751
02:04:04,377 --> 02:04:05,620
[SHOT FIRED]

1752
02:04:29,275 --> 02:04:33,210
I sealed the gates of the temple,
to protect those scriptures

1753
02:04:33,234 --> 02:04:37,108
and give meaning to
Kaadambari's sacrifice.

1754
02:04:37,484 --> 02:04:41,043
I fabricated the story of
the Goddess for people

1755
02:04:41,067 --> 02:04:44,192
to be afraid to set
foot inside the temple.

1756
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:57,192
If I told the truth, there won't
be any safety for those texts.

1757
02:04:57,234 --> 02:05:00,484
But, if I never told the truth, people
won't come to know about her sacrifice!

1758
02:05:01,359 --> 02:05:05,150
Which is why, I'm writing this
diary before leaving to England.

1759
02:05:05,484 --> 02:05:12,359
In hopes that, one day, people are aware
of the unsung warrior that is, Kaadambari.

1760
02:05:21,275 --> 02:05:25,275
Till date, we believed that those
texts were written by a goddess.

1761
02:05:25,442 --> 02:05:26,482
But that is totally false!

1762
02:05:26,651 --> 02:05:28,067
It was written by Kaadambari.

1763
02:05:28,317 --> 02:05:29,859
This diary is the proof for it.

1764
02:05:30,150 --> 02:05:33,859
Everyone know it's the work of the
goddess, who are you to deny it?

1765
02:05:33,984 --> 02:05:35,984
Not a goddess, but Kaadambari!

1766
02:05:36,317 --> 02:05:39,651
The glory of this temple is that
story and what we all believe in!

1767
02:05:40,275 --> 02:05:42,359
It's not belief, but a superstition.

1768
02:05:42,567 --> 02:05:45,084
Stop it! We can't tolerate you,
smearing the name of our goddess.

1769
02:05:45,108 --> 02:05:46,710
Oh no! What if the goddess
is angered by this?

1770
02:05:46,734 --> 02:05:47,442
Trustee sir.

1771
02:05:47,609 --> 02:05:51,192
It is our responsibility
to bring forth the tale

1772
02:05:51,234 --> 02:05:54,734
of kaadambari like we did
with her sacred texts!

1773
02:06:02,567 --> 02:06:03,567
See that.

1774
02:06:03,692 --> 02:06:05,692
The number of devotees keep
increasing day-by-day.

1775
02:06:06,359 --> 02:06:10,234
They believe that these texts were
given by the goddess herself.

1776
02:06:11,234 --> 02:06:14,108
Let it be belief or superstition.

1777
02:06:15,984 --> 02:06:19,108
But, it draws a lot of
people towards this temple

1778
02:06:21,317 --> 02:06:23,108
and with more people, I get more profits.

1779
02:06:23,567 --> 02:06:25,251
But, if people come to know
that it wasn't a goddess,

1780
02:06:25,275 --> 02:06:27,943
But a mere human who
wrote these scriptures.

1781
02:06:28,234 --> 02:06:29,692
Who would visit this temple?

1782
02:06:29,984 --> 02:06:32,359
What will the goddess be reduced to?

1783
02:06:32,692 --> 02:06:35,901
And the money would stop pooling for me.

1784
02:06:36,275 --> 02:06:37,275
Therefore,

1785
02:06:39,943 --> 02:06:43,692
let this tale be left unspoken.

1786
02:06:46,609 --> 02:06:50,275
I will tell people the truth
and put an end to this!

1787
02:06:50,609 --> 02:06:58,192
Really? How do plan on convincing
everyone with just this book.

1788
02:06:58,275 --> 02:06:59,943
How will you prove it?

1789
02:07:00,192 --> 02:07:07,651
People like you need proofs and evidence,
but for me, my dance will do the talking!

1790
02:07:08,484 --> 02:07:11,067
My dance, is your downfall.

1791
02:07:18,567 --> 02:07:21,293
'You'll give me the "Kaadambari Katha
for my debut performance, right?'"

1792
02:07:21,317 --> 02:07:22,192
'Surely, I will.'

1793
02:07:22,317 --> 02:07:22,859
'Guru ji!'

1794
02:07:22,943 --> 02:07:25,183
'Shalini ma'am has been bitten
by a snake near the well!'

1795
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:38,150
How unfortunate!

1796
02:07:39,817 --> 02:07:44,275
People are believing that since your
wife disrespected the goddess herself,

1797
02:07:44,359 --> 02:07:47,400
she decided to punish her
in the form of a snake...

1798
02:07:49,817 --> 02:07:52,067
Do you believe in that?

1799
02:07:52,651 --> 02:07:54,692
Or maybe someone...

1800
02:07:57,400 --> 02:08:01,150
You wanted to bury the
superstition with your dance...

1801
02:08:02,067 --> 02:08:05,734
All you can do is bury your wife...

1802
02:08:43,567 --> 02:08:45,067
You performance was fabulous, dear.

1803
02:08:46,901 --> 02:08:49,734
You made us all teary eyed, wonderful!

1804
02:09:04,108 --> 02:09:07,734
You were my inspiration, right
from my childhood, Guru ji!

1805
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:14,234
I wanted to be your host
and orchestrate new

1806
02:09:14,275 --> 02:09:17,692
dances, after shalini
ma'am passed away.

1807
02:09:19,108 --> 02:09:23,692
But, all I did was smear your name...

1808
02:09:23,984 --> 02:09:25,359
Please forgive me!

1809
02:09:25,901 --> 02:09:29,359
Why are you apologizing?
Look at your success!

1810
02:09:35,859 --> 02:09:38,359
You brought out the truth,
with your dance!

1811
02:09:39,025 --> 02:09:40,359
What about my debut performance?

1812
02:09:42,234 --> 02:09:44,400
A Debut performance better than this?

1813
02:09:44,859 --> 02:09:47,651
You told the 'Kadambari Katha'
with your dance!

1814
02:09:47,943 --> 02:09:50,901
Perhaps even I wouldn't have
told it so magnificently!

1815
02:09:53,234 --> 02:09:54,943
Sitara, it's time to leave.

1816
02:09:56,359 --> 02:09:57,400
Have a safe journey.

1817
02:09:57,484 --> 02:09:58,484
OK sir...

1818
02:09:59,108 --> 02:10:00,108
Kaadambari!

1819
02:10:01,067 --> 02:10:02,067
Kaadambari!

1820
02:10:02,859 --> 02:10:03,859
Kaadambari!

1821
02:10:05,234 --> 02:10:06,234
Kaadambari!

1822
02:10:06,567 --> 02:10:08,067
Kaadambari!

1823
02:10:08,275 --> 02:10:09,359
Kaadambari!

1824
02:10:09,859 --> 02:10:10,859
Kaadambari!

1825
02:10:14,359 --> 02:10:17,442
Please forgive me for calling you names!

1826
02:10:19,234 --> 02:10:20,317
Kaadambari!

1827
02:10:21,108 --> 02:10:22,108
Kaadambari!

1828
02:10:23,484 --> 02:10:25,943
You portrayal of kaadambari is life-like!

1829
02:10:26,025 --> 02:10:30,317
What are you saying? She's
Kaadambari herself, re-incarnated!

1830
02:10:30,526 --> 02:10:31,275
Kaadambari!

1831
02:10:31,442 --> 02:10:32,442
Kaadambari!
