1
00:00:23,959 --> 00:00:26,459
The Wasteland

2
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,650
Lotfollah.

3
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,959
- Salaam, sir.
- Salaam.

4
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,359
Tell all the workers I need to see
them at my office after lunch.

5
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:52,459
Yes, sir.

6
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:56,239
Wives and children, too.
I have important business.

7
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:30,859
Shahu.

8
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,259
- Shahu.
- What?

9
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:38,259
No work after lunch.
Go to the office.

10
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:40,709
- The Boss wants to see you all.
- Okay.

11
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,759
He said everyone.
Even your brothers and sisters.

12
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,159
- I brought ice. Go get some.
- Okay.

13
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:52,659
Ebrahim.

14
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,909
No work after lunch.
Boss wants everyone at his office.

15
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,459
- I brought ice. Go get some.
- Okay.

16
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,359
- Mashebad.
- Yes.

17
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:06,359
Go to the office after lunch.
Boss wants to see everyone.

18
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,359
Very good.

19
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,059
Sarvar.

20
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,659
- Sarvar.
- Yes.

21
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,059
I brought ice.

22
00:05:23,859 --> 00:05:28,059
After lunch go to the office.
Boss wants to see everyone.

23
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:29,259
Okay.

24
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:29,859
Sit down.

25
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,559
Sit down.

26
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,559
You have all worked here for years,
and have witnessed how ...

27
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:51,109
I have struggled to keep our
brickworks from shutting down.

28
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:56,359
Lotfollah knows this
better than anyone.

29
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:02,409
He was born here 40 years ago
and has been working here since then.

30
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:11,659
There were 50 brickworks on this plain.
They shut down one by one.

31
00:07:16,559 --> 00:07:20,959
Only we are left and the Nayeb Kiln.

32
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:27,059
Building materials have changed.

33
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:31,859
Nobody uses bricks anymore.

34
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:36,759
Cement blocks have replaced bricks.

35
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,249
Fuel prices have gone up.

36
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,959
- Mashebad.
- Yes.

37
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:37,209
If you want to talk money,
go to Boss’s office now.

38
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:41,159
- Very good.
- Go now. He’ll leave for the city soon.

39
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,499
Salaam.

40
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,959
- May you be well.
- May you be strong.

41
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,559
- Go see him right now.
- Let me finish this wheelbarrow first.

42
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,459
Let me do it. Go

43
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:58,859
He might go on a trip and
be gone a long time. Go see him now.

44
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:23,409
Damn, I told Boss 100 times
to change these broken wheels.

45
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:24,659
Ebrahim.

46
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:27,959
Gohar.

47
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:45,959
Let’s go.

48
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,859
Now?  Ebrahim.

49
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:53,559
No, my dad will be right back.

50
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:59,261
He’s at the office. He needs time.
I told Lotfollah we’d go to his room.

51
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:02,729
Gohar, come with me.

52
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:05,529
Faster.

53
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:13,659
It’s noon. I’ll go make lunch.

54
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:18,259
Ebrahim,

55
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:23,659
tell your dad to get Mashebad...

56
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,959
to agree to give you Gohar.

57
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:34,759
My poor old dad isn’t against it.
Ask Mashebad why he ignores my dad.

58
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:44,159
He makes excuses.
He doesn’t want to give her away.

59
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:50,359
He wants his wages from Boss...
to send Gohar off to her sister’s.

60
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,759
He thinks she will waste away here.

61
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,259
Ebrahim has stayed here for Gohar.

62
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,259
Talk Mashebad into giving him Gohar.
He’ll take her to town.

63
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,959
Ebrahim is a clever man.
He did his military duty in the city.

64
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,859
Get Mashebad to accept.

65
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:11,559
What can I say?

66
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:14,459
Give me a brick.

67
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,859
I can’t help you now. I’m broke.

68
00:11:42,359 --> 00:11:44,859
Maybe I can help you next week.

69
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,459
Let’s see what happens in seven days.

70
00:11:50,859 --> 00:11:53,059
- Mashebad.
- Yes.

71
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:58,159
It’s better if Gohar stays here.
She helps you.

72
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:03,259
Don’t do this.
Wait a little longer.

73
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:09,059
Pay up your insurance.
My friend can help get a pension.

74
00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:12,359
Then take your family and go wherever.

75
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:16,159
For now, let her help with finances.

76
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,209
Sir, God first and then you.
Help us out a little.

77
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:28,309
Let me take Gohar away for a bit.
The boy will forget about her.

78
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:31,659
And if Gohar isn’t here,
Ebrahim will go away.

79
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,759
After Ebrahim leaves,
I’ll bring Gohar back to help us.

80
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,759
Fine. Get back to work.
We’ll see what happens next week.

81
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:48,059
I have many things to do.
It’s late. I need to go.

82
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:51,109
I know you’re going away.

83
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:53,959
Inshallah, you’ll be traveling.

84
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:56,259
No. Who said that?

85
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,559
- Lotfollah said so, sir.
- Lotfollah?

86
00:13:01,859 --> 00:13:05,859
Sir, you need to keep an eye on Lotfollah.

87
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:10,059
- Why? Did something happen?
- Well, he favors Sarvar.

88
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:15,759
On Thursdays, when you leave,
he takes Sarvar to the road to town.

89
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:20,459
He does Sarvar’s work to keep
up the number of bricks we make.

90
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:27,459
The workers are uneasy about this.
People think these two are scheming.

91
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:31,059
Who knows what Sarvar does?

92
00:13:31,209 --> 00:13:35,509
I don’t know how
every Thursday when you’re gone,

93
00:13:35,859 --> 00:13:41,159
she dresses up and goes to town.
She returns on Friday.

94
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,059
But what do I know, sir.
You need to know these things.

95
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:50,159
Very good. Now, go.
Tell Lotfollah to come see me.

96
00:13:50,359 --> 00:13:51,359
Yes, sir.

97
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,459
Did Boss give you money?

98
00:15:18,859 --> 00:15:20,359
He will,

99
00:15:21,559 --> 00:15:23,859
but he doesn’t have it now.

100
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:32,359
When has Boss ever had money for us?

101
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,259
Don’t be ungrateful.

102
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,959
God is great.

103
00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:45,459
We’ll work hard,
pay insurance, and I’ll retire.

104
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:48,959
Boss’s friend
will help me get a pension.

105
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:52,459
Then we’ll all go back to Mashhad.

106
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:07,359
Has any brick maker
ever retired?

107
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:08,409
No,

108
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:16,959
but Boss says there is a law.
You can retire after 60.

109
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:21,959
Boss has a friend
in the insurance company.

110
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:28,359
He will help us.

111
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:30,809
- Mashebad.
- Huh?

112
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:35,809
- How old are you?
- I’m over 60.

113
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,309
My National ID says I’m 50.

114
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:44,559
We applied for it very late.

115
00:18:03,959 --> 00:18:10,159
You have all worked here for years,
and have witnessed how ...

116
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:15,109
I have struggled to keep our
brickworks from shutting down.

117
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,559
Lotfollah knows what I’m saying
better than anyone else.

118
00:18:21,859 --> 00:18:27,359
He was born right here 40 years ago
and has been working here since then.

119
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:34,959
There were 50 brickworks on this plain.

120
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,959
They shut down one by one.

121
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:44,659
Only we are left and the Nayeb Kiln.

122
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:51,459
Building materials have changed.
Nobody uses bricks anymore.

123
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,759
Cement blocks have replaced bricks.

124
00:18:57,259 --> 00:19:03,659
Bricks don’t bring profit anymore.
They sell for less than they cost.

125
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:08,159
Fuel prices have gone up.

126
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:11,559
Butane and kerosine prices increase daily.

127
00:19:46,209 --> 00:19:48,409
Enough. Stop.

128
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:40,959
Where to Shahu?

129
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,359
I told you not to come here half-naked.

130
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:11,059
Hey, Shahu, I’m talking to you.

131
00:22:11,399 --> 00:22:16,099
Stop! Shahu!
Why are you naked?

132
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:17,959
Didn’t I tell you…

133
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,659
- Shut up!
- You jackass!

134
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,509
Didn’t I tell you
not to come here naked?

135
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:25,959
Move away!

136
00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:27,109
Lotfollah…

137
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,759
- Lotfollah…
- Shahu...

138
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:38,959
Get out of my way!

139
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,359
Shahu! Let him be! Shahu!

140
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:50,159
Ebrahim! Stop fighting!

141
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,059
Let me go!
Let’s see how full of shit he is!

142
00:22:57,359 --> 00:22:58,959
- Shahu.
- Get out of my way!

143
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,159
- Out!
- Stop! Shahu.

144
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:03,759
Out!  ... Out!

145
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:05,859
I want my shoe.

146
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,359
What are you doing here? Go!

147
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:15,459
Gohar! Get back to work!

148
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,659
Ouch.

149
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,459
Get up.

150
00:23:53,959 --> 00:23:55,359
Drink some water.

151
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,229
Let Shahu be, Ebrahim.

152
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:22,779
Stop messing with the kurds.

153
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:28,759
I told him not to come here naked.
He does it on purpose.

154
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:34,059
He's just being stubborn.
It’s too hot to work there in clothes.

155
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,859
You worked the kilns.
The bricks are hot.

156
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,459
Yes, it's very hot there,

157
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:49,959
but I never went
near the women naked.

158
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,059
I asked Boss to talk with Shahu.

159
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,959
- You talk to him.
- Let it go, Lotfollah

160
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,859
Boss will talk to him.

161
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,459
You keep saying that but
you haven’t once talked to Boss.

162
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:09,659
I didn’t need you to save me.
I’ll talk to Boss at the end of the month.

163
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:15,159
I’ll get my money and get away from
this hellhole. I’ll be free of all of you.

164
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,559
Why wait a month?
Go now.

165
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:22,659
If I were you,
I’d get my money now.

166
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,559
In a month Boss might be traveling.

167
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:29,659
You need to see him now.
He’s in his office.

168
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:33,159
Go.

169
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,859
- I need to finish here.
- I’ll take over, you go.

170
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,859
Lotfollah, tell Ebrahim to carry
bricks instead of fighting.

171
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:55,959
We're behind. I need
to seal the kiln with mud.

172
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:23,859
Keep your head down and get to work.
Don’t worry about others.

173
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:29,359
I'll tell Shahu to put his shirt
on when he goes near the women.

174
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:31,759
And you let him be.

175
00:26:33,459 --> 00:26:35,659
I hear you make fun of them.

176
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:41,159
You curse their Caliphate.
You swear using Omar’s name.

177
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:46,259
Ebrahim!
Omar is a Saint for them.

178
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:50,759
Now, get going.
I have nothing for you in the safe.

179
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:54,559
Let’s see how the month ends.

180
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:00,659
Sir, These are not my words.
Lotfollah made them up.

181
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:04,259
He always sides with the kurds.

182
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:07,859
He visits them at night,
and they get drunk together.

183
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:11,459
There are women
and children living here.

184
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:16,459
Really? They get drunk?
Lotfala and them?

185
00:27:18,759 --> 00:27:22,859
Very well. You should go.

186
00:27:23,959 --> 00:27:27,959
Forget about these things.
You keep to yourself.

187
00:27:29,459 --> 00:27:33,859
Winners
mind their own business.

188
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:41,159
Work hard for a while.
Save your money.

189
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,159
I’ll get Mashebad to give you Gohar,
and you two can go off together.

190
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,759
- Mashebad will never agree.
- He will.

191
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:01,359
If not, I’ll take you and Gohar to town,
and I’ll help you get married.

192
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,759
Without Mashebad’s permission?

193
00:28:05,659 --> 00:28:09,059
- Impossible.
- Nothing is impossible.

194
00:28:10,359 --> 00:28:15,959
I know people.
Everything in its own time.

195
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:20,959
Now it’s time for lunch.
Go, I have much work to do.

196
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:24,259
Sir, keep an eye on Lotfollah.

197
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:29,359
He sets the workers against each other.
He pays Sarvar special attention.

198
00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:33,059
He sends her to town on Thursdays.

199
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:38,559
He takes her place on Fridays,
to keep up the brick count.

200
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:44,259
He tells us Sarvar goes to see family.
My mother says he’s lying.

201
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:48,259
Sarvar has no family,
especially in town.

202
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,939
- Who knows?
- Very well, now go.

203
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:55,759
I told you to mind your own business.
Tell Lotfollah I want to see him.

204
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:18,859
(In Azeri) Did you talk to Boss?

205
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:20,059
Yes.

206
00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:22,659
What did he say?

207
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:26,559
He’ll talk to the kurds
and make them behave.

208
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,359
He said if they
don’t listen, he’ll fire them.

209
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,059
Woman, give me tea.

210
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,159
He won’t fire the kurds.

211
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,359
Take more bread. Eat your fill.

212
00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:48,559
I’ll have a tea, too.

213
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:52,659
Ebrahim, give me the sugar.

214
00:30:58,959 --> 00:31:04,459
Ebrahim, my son.
Keep away from the kurds.

215
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:16,659
Did Boss say anything about money?

216
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:18,109
He did.

217
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,559
What?

218
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,459
He said he’s broke;
to wait a little.

219
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:24,659
Oh, God!

220
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:28,659
How can Boss always be broke?

221
00:31:31,459 --> 00:31:36,059
Ma, tell dad
to get Mashebad to agree.

222
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:39,389
If he doesn’t do this,
Boss knows people in town.

223
00:31:39,459 --> 00:31:42,259
He’ll get us married
without permission.

224
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,159
I hope your words come true.

225
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:55,559
Ebrahim, my son.
Keep away from the kurds.

226
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:19,759
You have all worked here for years,

227
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:25,959
and have witnessed how I have struggled
to keep our brickworks from shutting down.

228
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:31,559
Lotfollah knows
what I say better than anyone.

229
00:32:32,959 --> 00:32:38,959
He was born right here 40 years ago
and has been working here since then.

230
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:47,259
There were 50 brickworks on this plain.

231
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,859
They shut down one by one.

232
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:58,759
Only we are left and the Nayeb Kiln.

233
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:06,259
Building materials have changed.
Nobody uses bricks anymore.

234
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:11,959
Cement blocks have replaced bricks.

235
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,559
Fuel prices have gone up.

236
00:33:18,959 --> 00:33:21,959
Butane and kerosine prices
increase daily.

237
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:31,059
Bricks don’t bring profit anymore.
They sell for less than they cost.

238
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:42,359
I have kept this place going.
I owe the bank money.

239
00:33:46,459 --> 00:33:50,963
The government promised to help me;
they didn’t.

240
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:02,459
Shahu, come here.

241
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:06,429
- Did you talk to Boss?
- Go talk to him right now.

242
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,759
He said he can’t right now.

243
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:12,259
He can't now?

244
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:18,259
He can’t?
So we stop working now!

245
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:20,259
We can’t keep working like this.

246
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:24,559
Don’t stop now. Load the truck first.
Then you go talk to Boss.

247
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,259
Lotfollah, it’s too hot for a dog
down here, but we're still working.

248
00:34:33,759 --> 00:34:37,659
Boss is up in his cooled office.
He doesn’t know about down here.

249
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:43,109
We can’t work for
wages from two years ago.

250
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:48,459
Brick prices have doubled.
And we are paid the same as two years ago.

251
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:52,659
We can’t go on working in this hell.

252
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,759
I know. I used to work there.

253
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:59,439
But you don’t have anyone.
You’re on your own.

254
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:02,459
I need to answer to the others.

255
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:07,359
Boss knows why we need money.
We can’t wait anymore.

256
00:35:08,259 --> 00:35:09,259
Shahu,

257
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:14,259
If I were you,
I’d go talk to Boss. I’d say I need money.

258
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:19,059
How can talking help?
He says he has nothing.

259
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,959
Go talk to him again.

260
00:35:23,859 --> 00:35:25,859
I will when it’s time.

261
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,459
It’s up to you.
Boss might go traveling soon.

262
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:35,759
Go to him now.

263
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:57,959
Get to work.

264
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,859
Let’s finish loading the truck.

265
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:07,159
Go stand by the truck.

266
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,259
Pass a brick.

267
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:24,659
I know it’s hot down there.
Especially in the summer.

268
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,759
If I get paid, I’ll buy a conveyor belt.
It will make things easier.

269
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,909
It’s not that bad with four people.

270
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:40,864
Until a few years ago
Lotfollah loaded the truck alone.

271
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:46,259
Bricks aren’t selling now.

272
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:52,459
Things will get better soon.
I’ll give you all a raise.

273
00:36:56,959 --> 00:37:01,159
I’m okay with it, sir,
but my sisters and brothers aren’t.

274
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:05,859
Our pay is not enough.
It's the same as two years ago.

275
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,159
You know our father is on Death Row.

276
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,359
We can’t pay off
his accusers with this money.

277
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:18,359
I know people for this, too.

278
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:22,009
I will get
the accusers to pardon your dad.

279
00:37:22,329 --> 00:37:25,729
Don’t worry,
I won’t let him be executed.

280
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:30,059
Everything in its own time.
Time will fix this.

281
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:34,259
Winners must be patient.

282
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:37,659
Get up and get to work.

283
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,059
Don’t worry.

284
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:50,659
- Shahu.
- Yes, sir.

285
00:37:52,509 --> 00:37:58,509
When you do things at night,
like drinking, keep it to yourself.

286
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:01,259
Sir, I never did such things.

287
00:38:01,459 --> 00:38:03,359
Don’t defend yourself.

288
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:07,259
I hear everything.

289
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:14,359
People can do as they wish,
as long as nobody finds out.

290
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:18,259
- Get it?
- Yes, sir.

291
00:38:19,259 --> 00:38:20,959
Get back to work. It’s noon.

292
00:38:21,059 --> 00:38:24,859
But Lotfollah
told you a bunch of stories.

293
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:28,759
He also does many things
that you don’t hear about.

294
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:31,759
He treats Sarvar special.

295
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,859
On Thursdays, he takes her to the road
and sends her to town.

296
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:42,259
He takes Sarvar’s place on Fridays
so we don’t fall behind schedule.

297
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:49,059
He tells us...
he sends Sarvar to see family.

298
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,159
But Sarvar has no family.
We all know it’s a lie.

299
00:38:55,259 --> 00:38:59,259
This divides the workers.
You know this better than me.

300
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:03,959
Go.
Tell Lotfollah I want to see him.

301
00:39:04,459 --> 00:39:05,459
Yes, sir.

302
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,959
(In curdish) What happened, Shahu?
What did Boss say?

303
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,659
Nothing.

304
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:21,859
He said he was broke and we had to wait.

305
00:40:22,959 --> 00:40:24,959
When has Boss ever had money?

306
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:30,359
Daddy will be dead by the time
we get our money. This is bad.

307
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:40,759
- Pour me a tea.
- Lunch?

308
00:40:40,959 --> 00:40:42,659
No, just tea.

309
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:54,459
Boss will stop the execution.

310
00:40:54,959 --> 00:40:58,659
His friends will get
a pardon from the accusers.

311
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:01,759
Give me the sugar.

312
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:08,259
We need to keep working as we have.

313
00:41:08,709 --> 00:41:13,509
It’s okay with me, but our brothers
won’t work for such little money.

314
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:19,159
You have all worked here for years,

315
00:42:19,459 --> 00:42:25,459
and have witnessed how I have struggled
to keep our brickworks from shutting down.

316
00:42:27,959 --> 00:42:30,459
Lotfollah knows
what I say better than anyone.

317
00:42:31,459 --> 00:42:36,459
He was born right here 40 years ago
and has been working here since then.

318
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:46,159
There were 50 brickworks on this plain.

319
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,809
They shut down one by one.

320
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:53,959
Only we are left and the Nayeb Kiln.

321
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:02,859
Building materials have changed.
Nobody uses bricks anymore.

322
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:08,159
Cement blocks have replaced bricks.

323
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,959
Fuel prices have gone up.

324
00:43:14,339 --> 00:43:19,039
Butane and kerosine prices increase daily.

325
00:43:20,459 --> 00:43:26,459
Bricks don’t bring profit anymore.
They sell for less than they cost.

326
00:43:30,759 --> 00:43:36,759
I have kept this place going.
I owe the bank money.

327
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,259
The government promised to help me,
They didn’t.

328
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,159
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

329
00:44:23,259 --> 00:44:24,759
Sarvar.

330
00:44:26,012 --> 00:44:29,300
- I filled this with ice for you.
- Thank you.

331
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:34,059
- Reza, give me a glass of water.
- Boss wants to see you.

332
00:44:34,859 --> 00:44:37,559
- Okay, I’ll go.
- He said to come now.

333
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,959
- What does he want?
- I don’t know.

334
00:44:41,249 --> 00:44:43,849
- I think he has something for you.
- What?

335
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,819
- He didn’t tell me.
- You could have brought it for me.

336
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,859
He didn’t give it to me.

337
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:56,059
I’ll go later.
The clay will dry up.

338
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:59,959
Boss is going to town.
Go now, I’ll do this.

339
00:45:46,259 --> 00:45:48,059
Lotfollah!

340
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:54,659
I sealed the kiln door.
Go up top and light the fire.

341
00:45:55,159 --> 00:45:56,859
Okay.

342
00:48:28,459 --> 00:48:30,459
Sir?

343
00:48:31,259 --> 00:48:34,259
Why shouldn’t I come
to you this weekend?

344
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:38,959
This weekend is no good.
My wife is returning to Iran.

345
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:43,159
I’ll tell you when she leaves.

346
00:48:44,859 --> 00:48:46,859
When will she leave, sir?

347
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:50,059
I don’t know.

348
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,659
For now, she’s homesick.

349
00:48:55,959 --> 00:48:59,159
Maybe she’ll stay
two months like last year.

350
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,359
Or she might get
fed up with me and leave.

351
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:08,759
I got some things for Reza.
Go get them from my car.

352
00:49:09,259 --> 00:49:10,959
Thank you very much.

353
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:15,959
Sir,

354
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:21,659
What will happen to Reza?

355
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:24,959
He should have gone
to school two years ago.

356
00:49:25,259 --> 00:49:27,259
Is his National ID card ready?

357
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:32,659
I have a friend in City Hall.

358
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,759
He’s following up.

359
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:41,159
But you know
these things take time.

360
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:45,659
Thank you, sir.
I’m worried it will be too late,

361
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:48,459
if he doesn’t start school this year.

362
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:53,459
Everything is done in its own time.

363
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,659
Now, get back to work.

364
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:00,359
Yes, sir.

365
00:50:43,259 --> 00:50:45,259
Reza,

366
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:50,219
Boss is getting your National ID.

367
00:50:50,359 --> 00:50:55,859
You’ll start school
this year, and learn to read.

368
00:50:58,959 --> 00:51:02,659
Mommy, did Lotfollah go to school?

369
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,059
No.

370
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:08,059
But he can read and write.

371
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:16,659
I know.

372
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:09,659
Mommy,
does Lotfollah have a National ID?

373
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:24,159
Put these away when you finish.

374
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:10,459
Sit down. Sit down.

375
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:21,359
You have all worked here for years,

376
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:32,059
and have witnessed how I have struggled
to keep our brickworks from shutting down.

377
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:40,159
Lotfollah knows
what I say better than anyone.

378
00:53:40,659 --> 00:53:45,659
He was born right here 40 years ago
and has been working here ever since.

379
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:54,959
There were 50 brickworks on this wasteland.
They shut down one by one.

380
00:53:58,459 --> 00:54:01,459
Only we are left and the Nayeb Kiln.

381
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:11,059
Building materials have changed.

382
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:14,259
Nobody uses bricks anymore.

383
00:54:14,959 --> 00:54:17,959
Cement blocks have replaced bricks.

384
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:28,459
Bricks don’t bring profit anymore.
They sell for less than they cost.

385
00:54:31,659 --> 00:54:35,459
To keep this place going,
I'm in debt to the bank.

386
00:54:39,059 --> 00:54:41,059
I can’t do this anymore.

387
00:54:44,959 --> 00:54:49,459
I’ve sold this place
to pay back the bank.

388
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:53,559
We shut down today.

389
00:54:54,959 --> 00:55:00,159
You have until the end of the week
to pack your things and go back home.

390
00:55:02,459 --> 00:55:06,459
About your salaries.

391
00:55:06,959 --> 00:55:11,959
Write down the hours
you’ve worked and give it to Lotfollah.

392
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:17,159
I might not be able to
pay all of you completely.

393
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,859
But I will pay everyone something.

394
00:55:21,759 --> 00:55:26,959
Later I’ll give the rest to Lotfollah.
He will tell you when he has it.

395
00:55:31,459 --> 00:55:35,859
Lotfollah is our go-between.
He has my address in town.

396
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:40,959
Tell him if you have any
problems and he will let me know.

397
00:55:42,959 --> 00:55:47,159
Now go and get ready to leave.

398
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:52,659
The new owners
will not keep the brick works.

399
00:55:55,259 --> 00:55:56,659
Now leave.

400
00:55:57,859 --> 00:55:59,259
Go with God.

401
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:13,859
Lotfollah.

402
00:59:07,259 --> 00:59:09,359
How many bricks are in the kiln?

403
00:59:09,559 --> 00:59:13,559
Three levels are still baking.
One is off.

404
00:59:14,059 --> 00:59:16,059
Should I shut down the rest?

405
00:59:16,259 --> 00:59:18,059
Let them bake.

406
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:21,959
I’ll send a truck tomorrow.

407
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:25,159
Tell the Kurds to load
the truck before they leave.

408
00:59:25,659 --> 00:59:26,759
Yes, sir.

409
00:59:27,959 --> 00:59:29,959
What will I do now, sir?

410
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,539
Go to town. Find a job.

411
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:38,959
Sir, I’ve been here since I was a child.
I have no place to go,

412
00:59:39,059 --> 00:59:42,959
or anyone to go to.
All I know is brick-making.

413
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:49,159
You are 40 now.
You’re no longer a child.

414
00:59:50,859 --> 00:59:52,859
You’ve been to town often.

415
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,659
You know how things work.
I’ll give you part of what I owe you.

416
00:59:58,059 --> 01:00:00,359
Go find a room in town.

417
01:00:03,959 --> 01:00:08,959
Find a woman like
yourself to come live with you.

418
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:11,559
You’ll find a job.

419
01:00:12,959 --> 01:00:17,259
Get the timesheets from the workers
and give them to me when I come tomorrow.

420
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:18,359
Yes, sir.

421
01:00:18,459 --> 01:00:20,959
When I get money.
I’ll settle our account.

422
01:00:23,059 --> 01:00:24,559
Now, get going.

423
01:00:25,609 --> 01:00:29,109
Sir, like me,
Sarvar has nowhere to go.

424
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:31,959
Lotfollah! Forget about Sarvar.

425
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,559
She’s no good for you.

426
01:00:35,759 --> 01:00:39,959
She might be attractive,
but she's starting to age.

427
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:44,159
She will need help soon.
She will become a burden.

428
01:00:45,259 --> 01:00:48,259
You’ll spend
all you make on doctors.

429
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,859
A wife must be
half her husband’s age,

430
01:00:53,759 --> 01:00:57,459
so she can help him
when he's older.

431
01:00:58,059 --> 01:01:01,259
She has nowhere to go.
What will she do?

432
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,159
She can take care of herself.

433
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:07,759
You just take care of yourself.

434
01:01:08,459 --> 01:01:11,359
Now, go. I have things to do.

435
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:12,859
Yes, sir.

436
01:04:38,479 --> 01:04:41,619
- Salaam.
- Salaam, Ebrahim.

437
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:44,639
Shahu.

438
01:04:45,809 --> 01:04:46,959
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

439
01:04:47,059 --> 01:04:49,059
- Did you write it?
- Yes, come in.

440
01:04:49,159 --> 01:04:51,259
Let me see.
How many months are you owed?

441
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:55,159
It’s eight months.
Give me the timesheet.

442
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:04,159
Tell Boss he promised
a raise after New Year’s.

443
01:05:06,659 --> 01:05:10,659
When will Boss pay us?
We’re packing and leaving tomorrow.

444
01:05:11,059 --> 01:05:13,259
We’re having dinner.
I’ll set you a place.

445
01:05:13,399 --> 01:05:14,899
Thank you.

446
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:18,859
Ebrahim, did you make your timesheet?

447
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:22,259
- Here it is.
- How many months are you owed?

448
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:23,459
Ten months.

449
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:29,659
Last year, when the Kurds refused,
my dad and I loaded the truck. Tell Boss.

450
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:31,459
Last year?

451
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:34,759
Okay.

452
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:44,159
Lotfollah, when is Boss going to pay us?
We’re going back to our village tomorrow.

453
01:05:44,859 --> 01:05:49,359
Lotfollah,
can me and Gohar go to your room?

454
01:05:49,659 --> 01:05:50,659
Go ahead.

455
01:05:50,859 --> 01:05:54,159
She’s in Sarvar’s room.
Tell her to come.

456
01:05:58,209 --> 01:05:59,909
Mashebad.

457
01:06:01,759 --> 01:06:03,459
- Mashebad.
- Yes.

458
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:06,559
- Bring me your time sheet.
- Okay.

459
01:06:16,759 --> 01:06:19,259
Here you are, Salaam.

460
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:24,559
- How much are you owed?
- Nine months and ten days.

461
01:06:25,159 --> 01:06:27,159
Gohar wrote it all.

462
01:06:28,259 --> 01:06:33,259
We're still owed from last year.
I told Boss, but he didn’t accept it.

463
01:06:33,429 --> 01:06:34,829
We don’t agree with that.

464
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:39,109
- Lotfala, when will Boss pay us?
- I don’t know.

465
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:42,859
We’re packing our things.
We’re going to Mashhad tomorrow.

466
01:06:42,959 --> 01:06:44,959
I don’t know, Mashebad.

467
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:53,359
Sarvar.

468
01:06:56,909 --> 01:06:58,209
Sarvar.

469
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:06,659
Didn't you write what you’re owed?

470
01:07:06,959 --> 01:07:08,959
- No.
- Why not?

471
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,259
Boss knows how much, I don’t.

472
01:07:13,159 --> 01:07:15,159
Gohar, come here.

473
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:22,059
- Salaam.
- Go to my room. Ebrahim wants you.

474
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:38,059
- Are you leaving tomorrow?
- I don’t know yet.

475
01:07:44,459 --> 01:07:49,159
- You’ll go to town, right?
- I don’t know, Lotfollah.

476
01:10:15,309 --> 01:10:19,309
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Huh?

477
01:10:20,059 --> 01:10:24,059
- Are we leaving tomorrow?
- I don’t know.

478
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,789
Mommy, is Lotfollah going away, too?

479
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:32,359
Go to sleep, Reza.

480
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:40,259
- Lotfala, let’s go.
- You go, I’ll catch up.

481
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:18,159
Run, Gohar, run!

482
01:12:25,059 --> 01:12:26,159
Hurry!

483
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:09,059
Lotfollah.

484
01:15:22,009 --> 01:15:23,709
- Salaam, sir.
- Salaam.

485
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:28,059
Why are the kurds waiting at the road?
They're supposed to load the truck.

486
01:15:28,059 --> 01:15:30,559
Send the truck, sir. I’ll load it.

487
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:35,359
- Who's left?
- Everyone is gone.

488
01:15:35,949 --> 01:15:39,949
They said I can hold the money,
and they’ll come and get it.

489
01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:41,659
Is everyone gone?
Nobody's here?

490
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:43,759
Sarvar is still here, sir.

491
01:15:44,259 --> 01:15:46,859
- Did you get their timesheets?
- Yes, sir.

492
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:48,659
Bring them to my office.

493
01:15:48,859 --> 01:15:53,359
Tell Sarvar to pack if
she wants a ride to town.

494
01:16:50,859 --> 01:16:52,259
Sarvar.

495
01:17:00,559 --> 01:17:04,659
Didn’t you pack?
Don’t you want to leave?

496
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:07,159
I don't know.

497
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:15,659
Boss is here. He wants you
to pack and be ready to go to town.

498
01:17:22,859 --> 01:17:25,659
Are you going to stay with Boss in town?

499
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:39,759
Lotfollah.

500
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:50,259
Boss took me as his
temporary wife years ago.

501
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:57,859
When I went to town
on weekends, I stayed with Boss.

502
01:18:00,559 --> 01:18:01,959
I know.

503
01:18:04,159 --> 01:18:06,159
I've known for a while.

504
01:18:07,859 --> 01:18:12,559
I thought you wouldn't
stay his temporary wife.

505
01:19:21,059 --> 01:19:24,559
- Here are the timesheets, sir.
- Give them to me.

506
01:19:27,259 --> 01:19:31,759
I got the money for this place.
I can settle everyone's wages.

507
01:19:33,959 --> 01:19:37,259
The new owners will be
here tomorrow to take over.

508
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:40,149
You be here, too.
We'll see what happens.

509
01:19:40,209 --> 01:19:41,209
Yes, sir.

510
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:46,159
They might need a night guard.

511
01:19:47,559 --> 01:19:51,059
If they do, stay with them.
They are good people.

512
01:19:51,259 --> 01:19:53,459
Yes, sir. I have nowhere else to go.

513
01:19:53,859 --> 01:19:56,109
Are the bricks ready?
Did you turn off the kiln?

514
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,159
They’ll bake until dusk.
I’ll shut off them then.

515
01:19:58,459 --> 01:20:00,659
Very good.
Take these to my car.

516
01:20:01,159 --> 01:20:02,459
Yes, sir.

517
01:20:08,759 --> 01:20:12,159
- Is Sarvar ready?
- I told her, sir.

518
01:21:49,859 --> 01:21:54,059
Here, lock up the rooms.
I don’t want any animals in them.

519
01:21:57,309 --> 01:22:00,509
I’ll be here before the new owners
tomorrow. Do you need anything?

520
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:02,009
No, sir.

521
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:09,409
I found Sarvar work at a friend’s house.

522
01:22:09,559 --> 01:22:11,559
She can work there for now.

523
01:22:15,559 --> 01:22:17,559
Now, go help them in.

524
01:22:32,659 --> 01:22:34,659
- Salaam.
- Salaam.

525
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:40,159
- Salaam, sir.
- Salaam.

526
01:22:44,559 --> 01:22:46,859
- Anything else?
- Nope.

527
01:22:47,259 --> 01:22:49,159
Good-bye, Lotfollah.
