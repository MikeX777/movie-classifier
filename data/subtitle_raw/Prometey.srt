<i>Katherina, I can see what's going on.</i>

13
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,670
<i>Pan*, I can see what's going on.</i>

14
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,010
<i>Here is my bride</i>

15
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,140
<i>You are our Pan</i>

16
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:12,120
<i>You declared us (your
people) free, but...</i>

17
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,620
<i>Katherina, when I have
finished my working duties</i>

18
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,870
<i>I'll cover the roof with reed</i>

19
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,630
<i>and mother will [unintelligible] it.</i>

20
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,400
<i>You would help me.</i>

21
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,350
<i>In the autumn we can move in.</i>

22
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,330
<i>Our house will be warm</i>

23
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,290
<i>We'll buy a horse from
the gypsies, graze it</i>

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,360
<i>Our child will graze it</i>

25
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,780
It didn't go as expected, the Pan sent
Ivas away as a conscript soldier.

26
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,740
Panichi*, steward, what will we do now?

27
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,110
My litte dove, "Moscow
doesn't listen to tears." *

28
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,790
<i>If only you Panichi knew</i>

29
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,480
<i>how the people are weeping!</i>

30
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,510
<i>Then you wouldn't do such things!</i>

31
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,800
<i>It's all in vain, mother,
the Pani are deaf</i>

32
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,580
<i>Even God has only ears made of tin.</i>

33
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,650
A travelling agent of the Rogozhsky
church-trade union, Piotr Zhukov.

34
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:47,640
Your Nobleness, the Rogozhsky
church-trade union...

35
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,960
is like a Makariev brotherhood.

36
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:54,170
For you, a landowner with
such a paradisical plumage...

37
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,956
it means the Kingdom of Heaven and the

38
00:05:56,957 --> 00:06:00,450
straightest way to the
Nizhegorodskaya province.

39
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,910
For my sales, the Ilyinskaya
province is enough.

40
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,380
Your nobleness, didn't God,

41
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,820
who was born in a crib,
in a simple sheep-fold,

42
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:22,110
stretch out his hand to
embrace the whole world?

43
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:28,720
We're fighting for the Caucasus,
stretching our hand as far as Persia,

44
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,790
closing the circle:

45
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,930
Caucasus, Persia, Astrakhan, Nizhny,
the Ukraine, and again the Caucasus.

46
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:47,530
Steamboats puff, trains rattle,
people turn over their roubles fast...

47
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:53,490
You, Piotr Zhukov, ought to
be not a traveller, but...

48
00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:00,770
I'm a traveller because I'm walking
on my own land with my own feet.

49
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,710
I'd like to be free in my business,
and have enough rights

50
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:13,830
to help our country's
industry with cloth, leather,

51
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:19,080
supply soldiers for example
with bread crust, bandages.

52
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:23,910
It'll be such a business,
such a business...

53
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,730
for you and for us.

54
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,680
I'm in love with this business.

55
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,090
H-mmm, yes.

56
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:46,670
This girl you have here, Your
nobleness, she's so good.

57
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:54,250
I'd take her and turn her into
a performing artist at the Nizhny fair.

58
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:02,110
What a girl, I'm in love with this girl!
Simply in love.

59
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:09,270
I'm leaving today. It's war.

60
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,560
I'll be in Moscow.

61
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,350
In Moscow...

62
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,460
Good luck in the war against
Shamil, Your nobleness.

63
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,350
See you in Moskow - we'll make a deal.

64
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:42,020
My kind regards to the brotherhood.

65
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,710
When passing through,
take a look at the crops.

66
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,580
<i>Be careful, Georgy Pavlovich,</i>

67
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,680
<i>this katsap* has "very round eyes."</i>

68
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,420
We are people of the
same Czar, Sidorenko.

69
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:10,510
It's good, Georgy Pavlovich,
to have a Czar in common,

70
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,070
But as to money, it's
better to have it separate.

71
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,260
Georgy Pavlovich, olives...

72
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,950
Bring some olives. Olives.

73
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,040
Olives?

74
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,360
Olives from the Caucasus. Olives.

75
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:51,420
Two deadly enemies, two powers:
The revolution and Russia.

76
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,900
What means life for one -
means death for the other...

77
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,080
Farewell, Sigismund!

78
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,630
Farewell, Gavrilov!

79
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,500
We shall meet yet.

80
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:14,250
Feklusha... Farewell, Feklusha!

81
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,480
I'm Maria.

82
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:22,760
Well, Maria. Farewell, Maria.

83
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,440
Gavriov - to the army.

84
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,460
Michailov - to the army.

85
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,460
And you - to Siberia.

86
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:58,220
"In the depths of the Siberian ores,
preserve your proud and noble patience."

87
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:39,341
"Your sorrowful toil
will not be lost, Nor

88
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:44,220
will be your lofty aspirations." [A.
Pushkin]

89
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, it's so hot.

90
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,990
Did you march all the
way in the uniforms?

91
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,490
<i>I'm not taking it off.</i>

92
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,140
<i>The old people say:
While I'm wearing it, it's mine.</i>

93
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,850
<i>Maybe later they will
give us better uniforms</i>

94
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,860
Sure.

95
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,050
A samovar to put on your head,
and bottles to cover your feet.

96
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,760
<i>The old people say:</i>

97
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:33,260
<i>It's better to remove the tree stump.</i>

98
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,230
<i>Such a grea man, but...</i>

99
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,910
<i>so maybe it will get easier for us?</i>

100
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,250
What do you mean?

101
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,360
<i>Better</i>

102
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,420
<i>a completely different person</i>

103
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,890
That's right.

104
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,220
One thing is a dog
without a collar, and...

105
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,730
- ...what's your name?
- Ivas.

106
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,700
And another thing is
a dog with a collar.

107
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,640
"The Rogozhsky church-trade union."

108
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,060
The war is coming to an end.

109
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,710
Somebody is getting rich.

110
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,650
Only it isn't you and me.

111
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:43,020
I certainly need money.

112
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,700
Buy my girl. A very good girl.

113
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:55,730
I'm an Old Believer.
We don't trade in people.

114
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:06,040
Your uncle is a general. He's in the
good graces of the Prince-Governor.

115
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:10,450
Your Nobleness,
if you get him to support us

116
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,920
we'd make such business together...

117
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,410
provide clothes for our army,
sell wares to the mountain dwellers,

118
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:25,350
buy goods from them,
plant cotton on their land,

119
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,340
build our own factory like in Tver,

120
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,530
all profits, all profits!

121
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,590
Very well. I can see
you're a businessman.

122
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,610
A factory is profitable.

123
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,830
Serve our fatherland. And
I'm giving you the girl.

124
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,050
She will love you.

125
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,480
I'm a liberal. My uncle
was a Decembrist.

126
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,720
The girl was freed long ago,

127
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:12,460
and now I offer her to
you for a wife, but...

128
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:17,340
in the Eastern custom: for a ransom.

129
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,510
My sincere thanks, Your Nobleness.

130
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:25,480
I shall love her so...

131
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:41,350
What a beauty, like a fruit-candy.

132
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,560
Oh, aunt.

133
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,610
Today we expect visitors!
And what visitors!

134
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,980
Ah, what people!

135
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,580
Oh, aunt.

136
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:32,150
Brother...

137
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:54,180
Nastasia, this is a newcomer.

138
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,310
What?

139
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,940
You will also be like my own sister.

140
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:24,100
I was frightened,
I thought it was the police.

141
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,240
No!

142
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:34,630
We have no license for the
institution, Piotr Ilyich.

143
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,770
Here is your license:

144
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,600
From the threshold - to the table,

145
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,470
lead them to the decanter,

146
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,580
make them sit down next to the pies.

147
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:56,160
Serve them as much drink and food
until everybody drops down in a stupor.

148
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,490

Observe the rules of the
business*, Nastasia.

164
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:01,360
You need to keep these people fat,
feed them properly.

165
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:08,620
A businessman gets rich by good
calculation, not by miserliness.

166
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,550
I'll do my best, Piotr Ilyich

167
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:15,890
Don't worry, we'll make an effort.

168
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:27,050
One cannot make any special business
with "Dunkas" and Khokhol girls. *

169
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:32,490
Now if we had a Persian
princess in our business...

170
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:40,170
Soon the road to Persia will be opened,
the war of the Caucasus will end.

171
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,820
There will be also new
goods: olives, rice...

172
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:55,270
Nastasia, olives! Rice, Nastasia!

173
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,420
What a merchandise - olives...

174
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:06,950
I'm thinking about the Persian princess.

175
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:14,110
How could Stenka Razin* throw
such a priceless girl into the river...

176
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:16,930
The Savage!

177
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,800
I'm making a low bow before the Boyar.

178
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,720
Let your "smerd" * kiss
your hand, Master.

179
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,830
Your feet, benefactor

180
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,220
You were a beloved and nice man,
when I first knew you.

181
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:15,300
Let me kiss your lips...
your nose... your navel

182
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,890
Dunka, don't be a fool!

183
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,700
Go to the devil!

184
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:28,030
The devil? But this is where
I've come to, from the devil!

185
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,790
You Herod! You Judas Iscariot!

186
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:39,510
For 30 pieces of silver you sold Jesus!

187
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,360
Antichrist!

188
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:43,110
Dunka, come to your senses!

189
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,450
I can't, I can't, I
can't stand it anymore!

190
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,280
I can't, I can't, I can't

191
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,580
What the hell is the
matter with you, Dunka?

192
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,290
Dunka!

193
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:01,140
Anathema! Here! Here!

194
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,690
Demon! Demon! Demon!

195
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,460
Dunka!

196
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:15,760
What a harmful girl. A
bad loss for the house.

197
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,690
You're a... good girl...

198
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:35,380
Here, take it, you'd better
hang yourself first.

199
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,250
This is a grave.

200
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,030
This is death.

201
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,070
What nonsense!

[Taras Shevchenko "Kavkaz"
(Caucasus) 1845] (transl. John Weir)

203
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,290
Mighty mountains, row on row,
blanketed with cloud,

204
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,990
Planted thick with human woe,
laved with human blood.

205
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,430
Chained to a rock, age after age,
Prometheus there bears

206
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,630
Eternal punishment - each day
his breast the eagle tears.

207
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,940
It rends the heart but cannot drain
the life-blood from his veins

208
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,660
Each day the heart revives again
and once again is gay.

209
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,440
The superstition of these people
may resist any enlightenment...

210
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,460
but they can't be insensible
to the benefits of improvement...

211
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,770
A host of soldiers on those
hills gave up their lives.

212
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:20,980
And as for blood!? All emperors could
drink their fill. (T.Shevchenko)

213
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,390
A riddle I cannot solve.

214
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,210
It pains my soul.

215
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:41,610
A great pity, that our plans
were not successful.

216
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,770
So much priceless blood wasted.

217
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:51,090
But through the overall
strength of the army...

218
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,900
Russia will always be stronger
than all her enemies.

219
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:05,270
Your Majesty, new army
equipment is necessary:

220
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,580
The new rifles can fire from 2000 steps.

221
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,420
Conic bullets which dig deep into
the body, making a deadly wound.

222
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,050
This is why the Chechen are
beating us, Your Majesty.

223

"The bullet is a fool,
the bayonet is a fine chap". Nikolai

224
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,230
We need to speak to the Princess.
We were sent here for this.

225
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:46,290
The Princess cannot see you.

226
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,150
Then inform her...

227
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,550
- in writing?
- No, verbally.

228
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,440
Never mind.

229
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,250
Over there, on the other
side of the river,

230
00:30:58,251 --> 00:31:00,590
many discontent people are gathering.

231
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:03,760
These are peaceful highlanders.

232
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:07,700
Horava* himself is going down the river.

233
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,180
10.000 highlanders, Mingrels,
Imeretins* are with him...

234
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,960
Why are they coming here,
those "peaceful highlanders"?

235
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,960
When they're here - they'll tell.

236
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,760
The princess will see you.

237
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:39,620
Just wipe your feet here,
and go to the upper gardens.

238
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:52,430
What do you want, my good men?

Each is forging his own fortune.

252

My good man,
we have the same God, the same Czar.

253
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,530
Englishmen - predators, would be very
pleased if there were quarrels among us

254
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:24,730
to get their claws and beaks
into our young body.

255
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,320
What do they want from us?

256
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,420
To them, this is a foreign land,
a foreign religious faith.

257
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,350
They just have the lust to destroy.

258
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,020
Shamil was bought by the English.

259
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:49,290
And now instead of good peaceful life...

260
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,370
English gunpowder burns out our eyes.

261
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,080
The English are ephemeral,
we are real.

262
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,150
We will bring you a good life.

263
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,820
Taking the trousers from
Christian soldiers?

264
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:58,950
It's for you, wounded brothers,
for lint and bandage.

265
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:56,350
They took off our trousers,
burned incense over us.

266
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,310
The funeral has been properly performed.

267
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,510
There will be a final judgment.

268
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,170
An angel will blow the silver trumpet.

269
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:16,830
Christian soldiers who gave their
life for Czar and fatherland

270
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,450
will be judged,

271
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,390
blank-arsed,
before the Highest Throne.

272
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,930
St. John the Warrior will
avert his eyes from such a host.

273
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:36,820
The Czar, who only sees us on parades,

274
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:41,900
will not raise his cup to such victors.

275
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:46,400
And the main thing is: how do I return
to my aul* without my trousers?

276
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,120
The dogs will snap at me

277
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,130
We are the Russian army.

278
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,530
We repelled the enemy.

279
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,780
Friendly forces were ahead, but...

280
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:45,090
We are serfs.

282
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:50,880
You'll be given some trousers now.

283
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:00,360
Let me hold your baby.

284
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,170
I won't drop him.

285
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:17,460
I could have had my own baby,
if it weren't for...

286
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,320
The serfs, Your Highness.

287
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,550
Yes, the serfs. I know.

288
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,690
The whole aul, Your Highness.

289
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,910
Yes, the whole aul, my good men.

290
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:07,330
Go!

291
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,790
Your Excellency, allow
me to take command.

292
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,620
You are so wonderful, so nice.

293
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,170
The Lord knows, Your Highness,
how devotedly I love you.

294
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,590
Why are those men coming here?

295
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,390
What a rotten people!

296
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,940
This shooting is no
good, Your Nobleness.

297
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,880
What are we shooting for?
To cripple the people?

298
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,490
Also, it frightens the live stock.

299
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,040
The cattle are nervous animals,
and their fright affects the milk.

300

War is not a market, Piotr Zhukov.

301
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,330
It's a fair, Your nobleness, a fair!

302
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,150
Buy and sell!

303
00:43:21,992 --> 00:43:26,500
How strange! Our regiment!

304
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:30,230
They're our men! Ours!

305
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,740
Ours indeed! They're shooting at us,
this means they are Russians.

306
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,010
Gavrilov, ours!

307
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:43,550
This is the 4th platoon!

308
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:48,870
Maybe I... should go...

309
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,270
Ours!

310
00:43:58,950 --> 00:44:02,480
Ours! Ours!

311
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:11,220
Ours!

312
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,830
Gavrilov, ours!

313
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,090
Surrender!

314
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,390
We'll show mercy on you.

315
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,980
Your nobles will do the same.

316
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:48,680
You're scumbags. Graveworms. Even worse!

317
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:54,670
Worms eat the dead, but
you're eating us alive.

318
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:58,230
Soldiers, muzhiks!

319
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,780
There was such man, Prometheus,

320
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:05,610
chained to a rock over the abyss,

321
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:11,050
a mighty eagle picking at his heart.

322
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,000
And our muzhik's heart

323
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:22,890
is picked at by a mean two-headed crow

324
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:27,860
who is plucked to last
feather in wars of conquest.

325
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,400
Strangle the bastard!

326
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,040
Fire!

327
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,470
Forward!

328
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:42,300
Follow the leader, don't fall out!

329
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:51,190
Neither fire nor water will help.

330
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,370
Riots in the villages, riots on the
Volga, riots in the factories.

331
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,670
The dawn of freedom is breaking.

332
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,570
Take him alive!

333
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,690
Forward!

334
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:07,660
Hurrah!

335
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,900
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

336
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:52,690
I order each soldier of the company
to hit him in the face.

337
00:46:55,390 --> 00:47:02,390
Hit him hard, so that he and
the others will understand...

338
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:09,150
that revolution in Russia is impossible.

339
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,320
Attention!

340
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:58,450
Company!

341
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,230
Fire!

342
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:02,220
A court-martial shall be prepared
for Private Gavrilov and the others.

343
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:07,390
Report the court's decision
to His Excellency.

344
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:13,430
Line up the captives!

345
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,090
Her Highness, Princess
Elena Konstantinovna

346
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:22,610

522
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:13,200
Prokofy.

523
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:20,050
Gregory. Piotr. Eudokim.

524
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:26,050
Sidorenko! Call Sidorenko!

525
01:20:35,350 --> 01:20:37,910
What do you want?

526
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:46,220
<i>Today is the first anniversary
after we defeated Private Gavrilov,</i>

527
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:54,340
<i>and got medals and crosses
for our victory over him.</i>

528
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,210
<i>That's why I'm here.</i>

529
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:16,780
<i>And they want to watch.</i>

530
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,410
You rats!

531
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:27,920
Dirty rats!

532
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:49,420
<i>I'm Sidorenko, pan Svichka's manager.</i>

533
01:21:50,630 --> 01:21:51,850
A riot!

534
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:59,570
A riot? In a village? This cannot be.

535
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:03,100
<i>What's going on... what's going on...</i>

536
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,160
<i>They sing forbidden songs,</i>

537
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:14,640
<i>that crazy soldier hit the Pan right in
his face, in front of all the others.</i>

538
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,300
A man don't consist of only a face.

539
01:22:19,490 --> 01:22:23,591
<i>His own Pan! And what a Pan he is!</i>

540

543
01:22:32,191 --> 01:22:35,570
I've come to build a
factory in your region.

544
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,020
We shall raise the people with capital.

545
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:44,910
Young and old will start
thinking about their own interests.

546
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:52,680
Get in, I'm going your way.

547
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:10,620
<i>Ivas, what's gonna happen next?</i>

548
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,560
<i>Next, we'll fight.</i>

549
01:23:14,860 --> 01:23:17,400
<i>If we can't overcome... in vain...</i>

550
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,450
<i>At least something...</i>

551
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:22,440
<i>The dawn of freedom is breaking.</i>

552
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:26,740
<i>Why sheepskin?</i>

553
01:23:26,930 --> 01:23:30,850
<i>There will be a winter,
and maybe not only one.</i>

554
01:23:39,060 --> 01:23:39,759
The end.
