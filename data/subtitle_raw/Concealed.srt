1
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:24,367
- Oi.

2
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,233
I'll be back in a month.

3
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,300
The usual thing, feed the fish.

4
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,267
Lots of love, Jodi.

5
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,133
- Not too shabby, huh?

6
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,900
- Okay, bye.

7
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,100
- Reckon she'll like these?

8
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,867
- Yeah, look how cute they are.

9
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:53,500
- I still
can't believe it.

10
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,800
- Do we have to have
this discussion again?

11
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,533
- I know, I know,
I've said it before.

12
00:03:56,533 --> 00:03:58,067
- Change-of-life baby.

13
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,167
Some woman have
children into their 50s.

14
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:00,967
- Yeah.

15
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,433
I'm just bloody
glad it wasn't us.

16
00:04:05,433 --> 00:04:07,067
- Yeah, you've said
that before too.

17
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Hey, what's this?

18
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:20,133
- Don't know.

19
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,200
Maybe the giraffe and
hippo are breeding.

20
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,133
- My wallet's not in here.

21
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,633
Did I give it to you?

22
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:32,900
- No.
- Sure?

23
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,833
Can you go and get the
ticket to the airline?

24
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,900
- Yeah, sure.
- In that little thing...

25
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,133
- Yeah, I know.

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,467
Drop the gun, dead
beat, or I'll blow

27
00:04:55,467 --> 00:04:57,933
your testicles to kingdom come.

28
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,633
Who says dead beat?

29
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,900
Sounds shit.

30
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,700
- I don't suppose
you've had another

31
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,433
look for my wallet?

32
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,767
- Oh.

33
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:07,067
No, I'm just learning
my lines, babe.

34
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,133
- Don't worry about it.

35
00:05:14,133 --> 00:05:14,967
Hello?

36
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,833
Yeah.

37
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,267
Yep.

38
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,433
Ah, that's awesome.

39
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,433
Bye.

40
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,167
- Who was it?

41
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:40,200
- Hello?

42
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,133
- Sis, it's me.

43
00:05:43,267 --> 00:05:44,500
Are you alone?

44
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,233
- Yeah, what's wrong?

45
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,433
- Sorry for disturbing you.

46
00:06:09,433 --> 00:06:11,033
Jodi left a second set of keys.

47
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:12,867
- Oh, thanks for that.

48
00:06:12,867 --> 00:06:15,167
- That's cute.

49
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,267
- Oh, did you hear that?

50
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,100
She thinks you're cute.

51
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,867
Think you'd better have him.

52
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:21,700
- Aww.

53
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,200
Sure?

54
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,467
What do you say?

55
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,733
- Thank you.

56
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:27,233
- Catch you later.

57
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,033
Sallie?

58
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:19,767
Sallie?

59
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:28,467
Hey, Bill.

60
00:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,600
You haven't seen
Sallie around, have ya?

61
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,433
- No, is everything all right?

62
00:07:32,433 --> 00:07:35,800
- Yeah, she's probably
just gone for a wander.

63
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,667
It's a little bit strange

64
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,600
but I'm sure it'll
be okay, Irene.

65
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,433
- Well, you've
got me worried now.

66
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:17,900
- Well, don't be.

67
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,733
Honestly, I'm sure she'll
wander in any second.

68
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,833
I'll call you as soon
as I know anything.

69
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,667
Bye-bye.

70
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,367
Look, the reason I'm calling is

71
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,567
I'm just wondering,
have you seen Sallie

72
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,100
at all or have
you spoken to her?

73
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,267
- No, I haven't.

74
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,100
- Hmm.

75
00:08:39,967 --> 00:08:41,000
- Is something wrong?

76
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,500
- Oh no, it's just,
she's just not about.

77
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,333
Well, if she shows up
can you give us a call?

78
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,867
Uh-huh.

79
00:09:00,867 --> 00:09:01,733
Thank you, Jacky.

80
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:14,100
If someone is admitted
under that name

81
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,467
can you please get them
to call me immediately?

82
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,333
Have you heard from her?

83
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,567
- No.

84
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:29,400
Have you?

85
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,600
Called the police?

86
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,433
- Yeah.

87
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,867
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

88
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,333
- Look, is there
something I can do?

89
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,733
I could, I could stay with you.

90
00:09:53,733 --> 00:09:56,067
- Look, the police
are on their way.

91
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:57,733
They'll probably
be here any minute.

92
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,933
- Has she disappeared before?
- No.

93
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,500
- Was she on medication?
- No.

94
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,633
Isn't the first 48 hours,
they're really crucial, yeah?

95
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:09,900
- They are, Mr.
Raven, but there are

96
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,333
some questions we
need to ask, okay?

97
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,200
- Of course.

98
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,900
- The two of you
getting along okay?

99
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,267
Any relationship troubles?
- No.

100
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:19,900
- Did she or
you have any money problems?

101
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,400
- No.

102
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,900
- Did she take her passport
or credit cards with her?

103
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:28,400
- Actually, her passport's
here but her wallet was stolen.

104
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,767
- Stolen?

105
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:30,967
- Yeah.

106
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:34,133
Somewhere between
the airport and here.

107
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,367
- Any reason that
you can think of

108
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,800
for her to leave so suddenly?

109
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
- No.

110
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,067
- Anything
at all you'd like to add?

111
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,300
- Yeah, it's strange.

112
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,833
I think we were followed.

113
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,333
- Where?

114
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:00,533
- In the park, on the way
back from the airport.

115
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,800
- Did you get a
look at the person?

116
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,667
- No, I didn't see him at all.

117
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:05,867
- Was there
anyone that might have

118
00:11:05,867 --> 00:11:07,633
had a grudge against
you or your girlfriend?

119
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,200
- We've been away six years.

120
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,033
No.

121
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:18,300
- The end of the world party?

122
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,233
- Yeah, it's like, even if
we invite everyone at once,

123
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:21,933
we just invite everyone.

124
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,500
Maybe, like--
- Uh, sorry.

125
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,833
Mitch, get rid of
the cigarette, mate.

126
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:27,067
And stick it where
the sun don't shine.

127
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:29,233
You boys have a good
holiday, stay out of trouble.

128
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,500
Look, I'll see you
guys next term.

129
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,867
And remember astrology
assignment's due first week back.

130
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:39,133
What's a constellation
and who named them.

131
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,533
- Yes, sir, we know.
- Yes, sir, we know.

132
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,600
- What's the ecliptic?

133
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:49,733
Did you have a fight?

134
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,567
You said someone followed you?

135
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,900
- Yeah, I think so.
- Any idea why?

136
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,900
Is there anything else you
can think of that might help?

137
00:12:04,667 --> 00:12:06,267
- No.

138
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,033
- Surely there has to be
something out of the ordinary.

139
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,667
- I don't have it.

140
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,000
- She swapped it.

141
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,967
- Who did you swap it with?
- Susie Faletti.

142
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,967
- These gentlemen need
to find the elephant.

143
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:18,900
There's not a school
friend of yours

144
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,600
that would know her address?

145
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,067
- Okay, I'll try.

146
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:24,267
- Good girl.

147
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:25,800
I'll text you the address.

148
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,700
You look like you
could do with a rest.

149
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,233
- What are we looking for?

150
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:36,167
- Anything.

151
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,000
Oi!

152
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:50,767
Fagan.

153
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,467
What's that say?

154
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,800
- The Signatures Club.

155
00:12:56,467 --> 00:12:57,467
Fagan.

156
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:58,933
You know him?

157
00:12:58,933 --> 00:12:59,700
- No.

158
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:30,300
- Yo.

159
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,633
You boys looking to play?

160
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:35,467
- Yeah.

161
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:38,333
Mate, we're actually looking
for Fagan, is he about?

162
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,200
- All right, I'll tell you what.

163
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,700
Take a seat.

164
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,633
It's $20 bucks to play,
$35 if you win your match

165
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,000
we take five for the house.

166
00:13:47,633 --> 00:13:48,933
- Check.

167
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,200
- You boys
looking to find Fagan?

168
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:00,900
- Yeah, is he around?

169
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,267
- Nah, Fagan ain't been
around here for ages.

170
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,267
- Can you help us out?

171
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:12,100
- Yeah.

172
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,333
Yeah, I'll see you boys at
that door after your game, huh.

173
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:18,500
- I'll take your horse
thingy, and the black square.

174
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,567
- Check.

175
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:31,033
- You're gone, mate.

176
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:32,300
He just moved your queen--

177
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,800
- Hey, we're here to
find Fagan, remember?

178
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,100
- Mate.

179
00:14:58,567 --> 00:14:59,833
- Have you seen her?

180
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,100
- No, no, what are, what
are you playing at, man?

181
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,667
You fucking with us?

182
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:04,633
No, I haven't seen her.

183
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:05,567
I can't help.

184
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,833
I fucking can't help, all right?

185
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,767
Oh fuck!

186
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,000
Wait, wait, wait.

187
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,533
You boys had a deal
with Fagan, yeah?

188
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,667
I know what you're
after, yeah, yeah.

189
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:15,500
Yeah, okay, you
better not be cops.

190
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,733
- Mate, we're not cops.

191
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:18,333
- Okay cool, just
wait one minute.

192
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:27,433
Yeah.

193
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,267
Woo!

194
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:29,367
There you go, boys.

195
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:32,133
$1,200, yeah?

196
00:15:32,133 --> 00:15:33,167
Includes ammo.

197
00:15:33,167 --> 00:15:34,067
You won't do better, let's go.

198
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,233
You got the cash, huh?

199
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,433
- Um.

200
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
No, I think we'll
find Fagan, mate.

201
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,233
- Hey, hey, mate, Fagan
ain't doing guns no more.

202
00:15:44,233 --> 00:15:45,467
She's going straight.

203
00:15:45,467 --> 00:15:46,300
Yeah, let's go, okay.

204
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,167
Are we on or what?

205
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,600
Huh?

206
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,833
Okay, okay, now what's up, boys?

207
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,667
Let's go.

208
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,467
Um, a grand, that's it.

209
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:55,567
- Look mate, I think, really,
I think we'll pass, okay?

210
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:56,800
- You'll pass?

211
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,000
Mate, mate this thing
will smash anything

212
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,033
within 100 meters.

213
00:15:59,033 --> 00:16:00,467
What's the problem, huh?

214
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,533
- No, we just need to think
about this, all right?

215
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:03,567
- You need to think about it?

216
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,000
What's your game, man?

217
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,367
Are you undercovers?

218
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,167
Just look at this guy, man.
- Hey, we're not.

219
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,000
Relax.

220
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
- Relax?

221
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,433
How about I just take it--
- Hey.

222
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:11,667
- Keep your gun, maybe
that's a fair deal.

223
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,900
- Of course I want
it, I want it, yeah.

224
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,933
Mate, you've got to understand.

225
00:16:13,933 --> 00:16:14,800
Chill, please.

226
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,133
Please?

227
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:18,500
- Chill it,

228
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,000
huh?

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,033
- Okay, I came here to find
Fagan, do you understand?

230
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:24,867
So you've got to throw
in Fagan's address.

231
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:26,733
$750 is all I got, though.

232
00:16:26,733 --> 00:16:27,567
Deal?

233
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:29,567
- Get rid of it.

234
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:32,767
Mate, hey.

235
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:34,900
- Yeah, okay.

236
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,433
Keep a look out, will you?

237
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,367
- I can't believe
we bought a gun.

238
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:52,867
- I know.

239
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:55,600
But if I hadn't, he might
have put a bullet in us.

240
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:57,800
Plus I got the address.

241
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,000
Did you see how
wired he was, man?

242
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,367
- Yes, it was a very
uncomfortable situation.

243
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,633
- Hello!

244
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,833
Can you keep a look out?

245
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:32,667
- For what?

246
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:33,867
- I'm about to break in.

247
00:17:35,233 --> 00:17:36,133
- Mate, no.

248
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:38,067
- Just keep a look out.

249
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,633
Just hang back, all right?

250
00:17:58,633 --> 00:17:59,433
Hello?

251
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:08,900
Is anybody here?

252
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,033
- Hurry up.

253
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:27,033
- Hang back.

254
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:02,367
- Sallie's?

255
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,267
Hey, hide.

256
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:07,100
Hide!

257
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,567
- Don't fuckin' move.

258
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:15,667
Get down.

259
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:16,600
Stay there.

260
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:20,033
Where is it?

261
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,333
Where is the address?
- On the table.

262
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,300
- Jodi, 88 Shephard
Street, this is it?

263
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,733
This is the address?
- Yeah, yeah.

264
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,400
- Did you have to do that?
- Let's just get out of here.

265
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,000
- Okay, okay, I'll
call the cops.

266
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,067
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

267
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,533
Let's just take a minute
to think about this.

268
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:14,867
- Mate, I'm leaving
right now, come on.

269
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:16,333
- Just wait.
- Mate, we've got to go.

270
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,067
Come on!
- Fagan?

271
00:20:18,067 --> 00:20:19,033
- Oh, shit!

272
00:20:19,033 --> 00:20:20,533
Oh, shit!

273
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,600
What the fuck?

274
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:28,300
- Fagan?

275
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:30,833
- Down, get down!

276
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:32,433
Get down!
- Hey, hey!

277
00:20:35,733 --> 00:20:37,800
Get down, down, down, down.

278
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,600
- Don't kill me, don't
kill me, please, please!

279
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,067
Take whatever you want,
keep the elephant.

280
00:20:41,067 --> 00:20:42,033
- I don't want the elephant.

281
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,333
I want my girlfriend.

282
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,567
- I don't know where she is.

283
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:46,533
- What are you doing here?

284
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,867
- Why did you kill Fagan?

285
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:48,667
- We didn't.

286
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,933
What are you going to
do, fry him to death?

287
00:20:51,933 --> 00:20:54,733
Right, now you're going to
tell us what's going on.

288
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:56,333
- I'm not telling you shit.

289
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,133
- Uh-huh.

290
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,767
- Come on boys, come on.

291
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:00,567
What are you going to do?

292
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:02,100
Don't kill me, please.

293
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,667
- You're going to tell
me where the fuck Sallie is.

294
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,100
- You either tell
us or tell the police, mate.

295
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,767
Because that's where
we're going now.

296
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,400
- No, I don't think so.

297
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,867
Because I'm sure they'd
love to hear how we met.

298
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
As I remember it, you
were standing over

299
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,333
Fagan Smallman's dead body
with a gun in your hand.

300
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,567
I reckon that'll interest them

301
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:24,367
more than your missing
girlfriend's purse.

302
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:25,600
Oh yeah, and if I
remember correctly

303
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,100
I saw you put a bullet in her.

304
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,733
No, no, no!

305
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:30,300
I'll talk to the cops!

306
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,867
Please, let me out!

307
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:35,500
- Do you think
he's okay in there?

308
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,933
- Let me out of here!

309
00:21:49,367 --> 00:21:51,300
- Max
Raven recalls Sallie

310
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,233
on the phone before
she disappeared.

311
00:21:53,233 --> 00:21:55,833
- Yeah, we talked
about catching up.

312
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,167
Her seeing Mum and Dad,

313
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,700
nothing that would
be of any help.

314
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,500
- You realize you were the
last person to talk to her

315
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,533
before she went missing?

316
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,233
- No, I hadn't.

317
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:06,500
- Did she
mention who she talked to

318
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,400
on the other call?

319
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,433
- No.

320
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:11,000
- You're positive?
- Yeah.

321
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:14,233
- Was there a reason
you called her?

322
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,467
- She's my sister.

323
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:17,633
She'd just got in,
I wanted to say hi.

324
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:20,267
I haven't seen
her for six years.

325
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:30,233
- What are we doing here?

326
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,967
- Ah, audition.

327
00:22:32,967 --> 00:22:34,500
Audition.

328
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:39,700
- Great.

329
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:42,767
Where do we go next,
drop him off at yoga?

330
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,500
You can let go of me.

331
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,633
I'm not going anywhere.

332
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,067
- Sure.

333
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,233
- Listen, I don't have a choice.

334
00:22:50,233 --> 00:22:52,033
I just want to get the elephant,

335
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:53,867
get my money, and
get out of here.

336
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,367
You help me do
that, it's all good.

337
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,600
- Hey, and what
about Sallie, huh?

338
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,667
- What about Fagan?

339
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
- So where are we driving to?
- His place.

340
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,233
- What?

341
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:13,067
Why?

342
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:14,367
There's nothing there.

343
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,167
Oh, shit!

344
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:29,700
- Shit.

345
00:23:30,667 --> 00:23:32,067
What do we do?

346
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:34,067
- I've got the address.

347
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,867
G'day, mate.

348
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:43,000
- What do you want?

349
00:23:44,867 --> 00:23:47,033
- I don't know how to
tell you this but, um,

350
00:23:47,033 --> 00:23:50,567
I believe your daughter
Susie has an elephant

351
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:54,767
which belongs to me, and
I really need it back.

352
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,133
- She traded that at school.

353
00:23:57,267 --> 00:23:59,067
- Look, I really
have to have it back.

354
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:00,500
- Sorry mate, there's no way

355
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,333
I'm going to break my
little angel's heart.

356
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:07,933
- What about for a--
- Susie?

357
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:09,733
- At least I've never
made a little kid cry.

358
00:24:09,733 --> 00:24:11,133
- You're a drug runner, right?

359
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:14,133
- Fuck you, arsehole.
- You're the arsehole.

360
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,033
- Hey, oh, Max.
- Hey!

361
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,733
You tell me right now.

362
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,533
Why did Fagan have
Sallie's purse, why?

363
00:24:18,533 --> 00:24:19,667
- Okay, okay!
- Why?

364
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,900
- Let go, let go.

365
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,133
I would have told you
anyway, like I fucking care.

366
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:26,967
- Good.

367
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:31,033
- It was the first time
I'd ever smuggled anything.

368
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:32,133
I didn't know what it was.

369
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:34,200
I didn't want to know.

370
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,367
When we landed in Sydney,
everything went wrong.

371
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,133
I started feeling real sick.

372
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,300
I didn't know if it
was me freaking out,

373
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,800
or the bloody airplane food.

374
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,733
I just didn't think I could
hold it together enough

375
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,433
to get through
customs, you know.

376
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,100
So I gave the purse to Fagan

377
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,600
so she could get the elephant.

378
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:51,633
I just couldn't do it.

379
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,367
- Pull over.

380
00:25:09,667 --> 00:25:10,933
- Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

381
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:11,867
Just leave it.

382
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:13,533
Don't open them.
- Hey, hey.

383
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:14,367
- Chill.

384
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,433
- Are
you bloody serious?

385
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:22,600
- All right, they're
mine, they're mine!

386
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,967
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey!

387
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:25,300
You can have them when
I get Sallie back.

388
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,500
- Mate, I have to
hand them over.

389
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,333
I'm not fucking
around, I need them!

390
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,167
- You can have them
back when we get Sallie.

391
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:32,967
I don't want the
diamonds, you understand?

392
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:34,533
- I don't think you understand.

393
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:46,900
- Do you know much
about diamonds?

394
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,167
- No, that's why I'm here.

395
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:51,433
- This is a rough diamond, and,

396
00:25:51,433 --> 00:25:53,233
you don't have a Kimberly
Process Certificate?

397
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,967
- Mate, I'm just
after some help.

398
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,133
If you can't point me
in the right direction,

399
00:25:58,133 --> 00:25:59,167
that's, that's cool.

400
00:25:59,167 --> 00:26:00,267
- No, no, that's fine.

401
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:03,167
Just hang on a second.

402
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:13,267
No, he doesn't know a
thing about diamonds.

403
00:26:19,733 --> 00:26:23,600
- Look, I really feel it's time
we got the police involved.

404
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,033
We got the diamonds.

405
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,900
Why not just give
them to the cops?

406
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,533
- No, hold on to these.

407
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:31,567
Keep them well hidden, okay?

408
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,600
Oi, oi.

409
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,533
You even think about
stealing those diamonds,

410
00:26:36,533 --> 00:26:38,267
I'll make it my life's
mission to find you

411
00:26:38,267 --> 00:26:39,100
and kill you.

412
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,467
You understand?

413
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,667
- Yeah, whatever.

414
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,167
- Max, I don't feel
good about this.

415
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,500
What's the plan, mate?

416
00:27:20,167 --> 00:27:21,467
- Well,
if anything comes up

417
00:27:21,467 --> 00:27:22,700
will you let us know?

418
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,267
- Yeah.
- No matter how small.

419
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:32,900
- Sorry, Max, the
front door was open.

420
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,867
- That's okay, mate.

421
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,800
- Any clues to what happened?

422
00:27:37,633 --> 00:27:39,267
- Yeah, look, I, um,

423
00:27:41,267 --> 00:27:44,533
I'm not coping so well with
Sallie's disappearance.

424
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,400
I got a bit upset.

425
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:54,900
- Do you mind if we--
- No, of course.

426
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:02,767
- You
ever heard of a woman

427
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:04,600
called Fagan Smallman?

428
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,433
- Doesn't ring any bells.

429
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:09,733
- She was found dead
recently in her apartment.

430
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:13,333
- Right, is that related
to Sallie's disappearance?

431
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:15,867
- She was a member of
a local chess club.

432
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:17,367
- Yeah, how does
that concern me?

433
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,200
- Apparently
you made a visit

434
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,167
to this chess club.

435
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,467
- So I had a game of chess.

436
00:28:23,467 --> 00:28:25,000
- Have you ever heard
of conflict diamonds?

437
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,200
- Yeah, sure.

438
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,800
- There have been a lot
of deaths over them.

439
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,433
Civil wars, Mr. Raven.

440
00:28:29,433 --> 00:28:30,667
- That's not something I
want to get involved in.

441
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,467
- Yeah, well I reckon
you are involved.

442
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,400
I think you're out
there playing detective.

443
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,733
- Mate, I've just come
back to this country

444
00:28:35,733 --> 00:28:36,833
for a couple auditions.

445
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,033
- Do you think we're idiots?

446
00:28:38,033 --> 00:28:39,600
- Of course I'm
looking for Sallie!

447
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,467
- Just calm down.

448
00:28:41,867 --> 00:28:44,167
- Do you understand,
is that okay?

449
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,500
- Is there anything
you want to tell us?

450
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:50,800
- No.

451
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,233
- That's it, then.

452
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:05,267
- I hope you know what
you're doing, Mr. Raven.

453
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,200
- It's okay, mate.

454
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:12,567
- I'm gonna have to go.

455
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,267
- The food's almost ready.
- Yeah I know.

456
00:30:14,267 --> 00:30:15,600
Look, it's to do with Sallie

457
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,700
I can't really talk about it.

458
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,533
- No?

459
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,333
It's okay.

460
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,233
- So, after, after D5
there's a knight exchange

461
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:24,833
and then black will have
to retreat, say, to E7.

462
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:27,200
And as the white
tries to exploit the,

463
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,133
the pole weakness
on the queen's side

464
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:30,567
black will counter play
on the king's side.

465
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:33,567
Too fast?

466
00:31:33,567 --> 00:31:34,800
- Yeah, just a little
mate, just a little.

467
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,433
- Sorry, I'm not good at this.

468
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:37,800
I'm not good at this teaching.

469
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,000
- Well, you're
passionate about it.

470
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,767
That's all you need
really, to be a teacher.

471
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,200
A good teacher.
- You teach?

472
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
- Ahh, yep, yep, science.

473
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,367
11 years.
- 11 years?

474
00:31:48,533 --> 00:31:50,700
- Yeah.
- That would do my head in.

475
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,033
- Actually, it is good to
have a bit of time off.

476
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:55,600
- You call this a holiday?

477
00:31:56,767 --> 00:31:58,300
- You ever tried
to explain the laws

478
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,367
of the universe to kids
with behavioral problems?

479
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:05,067
- Good at science and such
a shitty chess player,

480
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:06,500
how does that work?

481
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,700
- On the ground!

482
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,967
On the ground, both of you.

483
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:11,933
On the ground and
don't fuckin' move.

484
00:32:11,933 --> 00:32:13,133
Check the house, mate.

485
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:16,767
Now stay down and shut up!

486
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,267
- Hey!

487
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:21,367
Now drop the gun.

488
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:23,400
- Don't be stupid, mate.

489
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,900
- I've got the diamonds.

490
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,667
- Then just hand them over
and let's end this now.

491
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:27,667
- You think
I'd keep them here?

492
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:28,833
- What do you want?

493
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:31,767
- I want my girlfriend.

494
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:34,267
You bring her and I'll give
you your fucking diamonds.

495
00:32:34,267 --> 00:32:35,067
- Where?

496
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:40,267
- Hawthorne Canal,
under the West Link.

497
00:32:40,267 --> 00:32:41,067
Two hours.

498
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,467
- The diamonds.

499
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:08,500
- Where's Sallie?

500
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,433
- Where are the stones?

501
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:10,867
I'm not fucking around here.

502
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:12,133
- I just want to
see Sallie's okay.

503
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:14,100
- The diamonds are
all that concerns me.

504
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,033
- Okay, you've got your
diamonds, where's Sallie?

505
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:24,133
- Hey, hey, where's my money?

506
00:33:24,133 --> 00:33:25,233
I never got paid.

507
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:26,233
- Where's Sallie?
- Wait!

508
00:33:26,233 --> 00:33:27,600
- I just want--
- Wait a minute!

509
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,433
- Have you got her or what?

510
00:33:29,433 --> 00:33:30,267
Hey!

511
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,200
- Fuck!

512
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,000
- I can't believe
you didn't use it.

513
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,500
At least when they were
in the car driving off

514
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,600
you could've blown out
a window or something.

515
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,700
- Hey, hey mate, this
is all new to us, okay?

516
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,500
We don't normally go
around blowing out windows.

517
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,633
- He's right, I
should have used it.

518
00:33:53,633 --> 00:33:55,467
- Ah, I'm so fucked.

519
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:01,267
You boys have completely
fucked this up.

520
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,300
They have the diamonds, your
girlfriend, and my money.

521
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,133
And what do we have?

522
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:05,967
Nothing.

523
00:34:07,233 --> 00:34:08,467
- Shut up!

524
00:34:08,467 --> 00:34:09,700
- I'm not scared of you.

525
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,900
Especially after how
you just handled that.

526
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,133
I mean, if Sallie's found dead

527
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:16,033
you can blame yourself
after that balls-up.

528
00:34:16,033 --> 00:34:18,400
- Hey, hey, hey, leave
him Max, leave him.

529
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,033
- You're an idiot.
- Leave him!

530
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,567
Hey, we don't need this!

531
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,300
- You thought you could
handle these blokes?

532
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,400
What are you,
James fucking Bond?

533
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,900
You're a bloody actor,
probably a lousy one.

534
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:35,133
There are people I owe
money to, impatient people.

535
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,767
You gonna protect me from them?

536
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:43,300
Damn right.

537
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:49,533
I should be busting your
ass for fucking this up.

538
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,300
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

539
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,867
Jesus!

540
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:53,700
- I'm a dead man!

541
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:03,267
- Fucking stay there.

542
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,267
- What, that's it, not a word?

543
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:06,633
- What do you want
us to say, Perry?

544
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:07,467
Eh, eh?

545
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:12,167
- You want us to ask why
or how you're a dead man?

546
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:13,600
Because I can tell you at this
moment, I don't care, mate.

547
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
- Well, fuck you too.

548
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:17,300
And your mate.

549
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,533
- Hey, hey, hey,
where are you going?

550
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:22,633
- Let him go.

551
00:35:22,633 --> 00:35:23,467
- Perry!

552
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:28,967
Where you going?

553
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:37,767
We're behaving like
people I don't know

554
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:40,933
and I don't want to know.

555
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,900
Guns, mate.

556
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,033
Kidnap.

557
00:35:46,033 --> 00:35:46,867
Murder.

558
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,467
Conflict diamonds,
drug smuggling.

559
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:57,333
You know the most exciting
thing that happened to me

560
00:35:57,333 --> 00:35:58,900
before this was getting
my wisdom teeth out.

561
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,600
Mate, can we just stop
and have a real hard think

562
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,300
about what we're doing here?

563
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:12,500
- I'm sorry, man.

564
00:36:16,733 --> 00:36:18,667
I need a place to stay.

565
00:36:23,167 --> 00:36:26,700
What?

566
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,533
- I can't.

567
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:31,367
- Why not?

568
00:36:31,367 --> 00:36:32,200
- I just can't, Max.

569
00:37:02,367 --> 00:37:03,200
- Hey.

570
00:37:06,533 --> 00:37:08,133
Any news?

571
00:37:08,133 --> 00:37:08,967
- Not really.

572
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,467
- I'm worried, Max.

573
00:37:24,067 --> 00:37:25,833
- I'm gonna find her.

574
00:37:27,033 --> 00:37:29,767
If it's the last thing I
do, I'm gonna find her.

575
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:31,000
- Yeah, I know.

576
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:36,100
- Okay.

577
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:42,133
Listen, I need to
ask you something.

578
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,400
- Okay, what?

579
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,000
- I need a place to stay.

580
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,567
Hello?

581
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:03,400
- Hey, look.

582
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:05,833
I'm worried about Perry.

583
00:38:05,833 --> 00:38:07,533
I think he's gonna
get killed, mate.

584
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,833
- What's that got to do with us?

585
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:13,467
- Max, I don't want
blood on our hands, okay?

586
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:14,800
I'm calling the police now.

587
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,933
If there's anything
you need to do, right,

588
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:19,400
to protect yourself--

589
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,233
- You can't call
the police, okay?

590
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,200
We put a bullet.

591
00:38:26,167 --> 00:38:27,000
- What, Fagan?

592
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:29,700
Mate, she was already dead.

593
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,667
- Cops don't know that.

594
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,067
It ain't gonna make
any difference to them.

595
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,033
- What if Perry is
telling the truth, okay?

596
00:38:40,233 --> 00:38:42,167
Then these guys
are gonna kill him.

597
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:08,600
- Perry?

598
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,500
You in there, Perry?

599
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,333
- Hey, Perry!

600
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,167
Oi!

601
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:23,500
- You can wait here a minute.

602
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,333
- Oh.

603
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,200
- Jesus!

604
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,233
I'll get the cops.

605
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,000
- Oh, shit!

606
00:39:38,867 --> 00:39:41,033
Sh--
- Hey, don't touch anything.

607
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:54,000
- We're not action heroes, mate.

608
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,600
School teacher, actor, mate.

609
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,433
That's it.

610
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,300
- Fuck, let's go.

611
00:40:42,167 --> 00:40:45,333
- The police
haven't told us much.

612
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,233
- No, me neither.

613
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:50,567
- Well, it's nice to see
you after such a long time.

614
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:53,000
Manners, look, this is Max.

615
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,833
- Hi, Max.
- Hello, you must be Violet.

616
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,767
Sallie's told me
a lot about you.

617
00:40:57,767 --> 00:40:59,967
- So you
can't sleep, huh?

618
00:40:59,967 --> 00:41:02,200
Would you like me
to read you a story?

619
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,967
Okay, say goodnight.

620
00:41:03,967 --> 00:41:05,300
- Goodnight.

621
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,133
- 'Night.

622
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:21,700
Look, Joe, I, uh,
I want you to know

623
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,633
I'm doing everything I
can to find your daughter.

624
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,200
- Oh, thanks, Max.

625
00:41:31,367 --> 00:41:33,467
But I think we'll leave
it all to the police.

626
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,933
- Oh, hi, Sallie.

627
00:41:38,933 --> 00:41:40,533
It's Bill here,
Jodie's neighbor.

628
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:41,667
Umm, I've just got a me--

629
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,267
- Hi, Sal, it's Jacky.

630
00:41:45,267 --> 00:41:47,367
Um, I really need to
speak to you so I'll try--

631
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,567
- Hi,
Sal, it's Victoria.

632
00:41:49,567 --> 00:41:50,733
You guys have probably landed.

633
00:41:50,733 --> 00:41:51,833
I can't wait to see you.

634
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:52,800
Hope you had a good trip.

635
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,833
Give me a call, lots of love.

636
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,933
- She told you everything, yeah?

637
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:03,467
Was she involved in anything?

638
00:42:04,833 --> 00:42:07,200
Anything I didn't know about?

639
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,433
- What do you mean?

640
00:42:11,467 --> 00:42:12,667
- You just start to wonder

641
00:42:12,667 --> 00:42:13,967
whether you really
knew somebody.

642
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,033
- Of course you did.

643
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,267
- What about the
last phone call?

644
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:22,867
Was there anything that she
said out of the ordinary?

645
00:42:22,867 --> 00:42:25,267
Anything stuck in your mind?

646
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,767
- Well, she was still upset.

647
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:30,600
- Yeah.

648
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,867
- It must have been
hard on both of you.

649
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,533
She wanted to keep
the baby, Max.

650
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,533
I mean, she knew you didn't,

651
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:41,967
she understood that, but,

652
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:44,967
it was really tough for her.

653
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:50,000
And she said she wishes
she hadn't chosen a name.

654
00:42:54,133 --> 00:42:55,633
Anais?

655
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:56,433
- Yeah.

656
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,400
- You, you okay?

657
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:04,367
- Yep.

658
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,833
- Can I get you another?
- Yeah, maybe one more.

659
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:17,767
- Hey, Max.

660
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,700
I have to talk to you.

661
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,267
We need to meet up.

662
00:44:33,267 --> 00:44:36,900
- How long is it since
you've spoken to them?

663
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,567
- It's been a while.

664
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,300
- Even your little sister?

665
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:46,500
- Yeah.

666
00:44:57,933 --> 00:44:58,833
You know, I never thought
that you and Sallie

667
00:44:58,833 --> 00:44:59,867
would stay together.

668
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:03,667
- Well, we did.

669
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,200
Come on, I went all the way to
South Africa to be with her.

670
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,700
- Maybe she's left
you for someone else?

671
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,533
- No.

672
00:45:13,533 --> 00:45:14,667
I love your sister.

673
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,433
- It's a possibility, Max.

674
00:45:16,433 --> 00:45:18,133
- No, it's not.
- It is.

675
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,767
- Yeah, well look I don't
want to hear it anymore.

676
00:45:19,767 --> 00:45:21,267
I won't listen anymore.

677
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:29,167
- It's just a possibility.
- Later.

678
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,467
- Where are they?

679
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:32,667
Where are they?
- What?

680
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,167
- We're only talking
about diamonds.

681
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,500
- Where's Sallie?
- Sallie?

682
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,767
Who the fuck's Sallie?

683
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,167
- Violet?

684
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,033
Violet?

685
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:46,633
Violet?

686
00:46:48,433 --> 00:46:49,267
Violet?

687
00:46:49,267 --> 00:46:50,933
Oh, my god.

688
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,400
- Look, I don't have them.

689
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,867
if had 'em, I would
give them to you.

690
00:46:53,867 --> 00:46:55,267
All I want is Sallie, that's it.

691
00:46:55,267 --> 00:46:56,533
Nothing else.

692
00:46:56,533 --> 00:46:57,967
- What about
that mate of his?

693
00:46:57,967 --> 00:47:00,267
The one who had the
diamonds under the bridge.

694
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:01,900
- Hey, he wouldn't
take them, all right?

695
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,533
- Yeah, hey, what's his address?

696
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,033
What's his address?

697
00:47:06,033 --> 00:47:07,233
- All right, he's got a
fuckin' family, all right,

698
00:47:07,233 --> 00:47:09,567
he'd never do it.
- Ahh, he got a family.

699
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:11,400
And you want your girl back.

700
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,633
You want your girl back?

701
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:13,467
- Yeah.

702
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:22,533
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

703
00:47:40,933 --> 00:47:43,200
- Okay, now who has
the fuckin' diamonds?

704
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,033
Huh?

705
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:45,533
Come on.

706
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:47,500
I'm going to start putting
a hole into this fucker

707
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,267
until someone's dead.

708
00:48:10,733 --> 00:48:11,767
- Not peeping?

709
00:48:11,767 --> 00:48:12,667
Ready,

710
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,267
and pop!

711
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,367
Open.

712
00:48:17,367 --> 00:48:18,667
Do you love that?

713
00:48:18,667 --> 00:48:20,233
- Yeah.
- Okay, you can have that.

714
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:21,767
What are you gonna call her?

715
00:48:21,767 --> 00:48:22,633
- Isabella.

716
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:24,133
- Isabella, lovely.

717
00:48:24,133 --> 00:48:25,567
Now, look at this.

718
00:48:25,567 --> 00:48:26,967
Do you think that's pretty?

719
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:28,033
- Yeah.

720
00:48:37,733 --> 00:48:39,067
- It's this way.

721
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:43,900
- Fuckin' better be.

722
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,000
- Jacky, where are they?
- What?

723
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,200
- Where are they?

724
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,367
- I don't know what
you're on about.

725
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,300
- I stuck a bag of
diamonds in your toilet.

726
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,467
With packets of diamonds in 'em.

727
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:07,600
Now one of the
packets is missing.

728
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:09,200
I ain't fucking
around, where are they?

729
00:50:10,333 --> 00:50:11,333
Where are they?

730
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,100
- I sold them.
- What?

731
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,067
Sold them?

732
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:16,067
- Yeah, I did.
- You sold them?

733
00:50:16,067 --> 00:50:17,000
- Well, it's your fucking fault

734
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,267
for hiding them in my toilet.

735
00:50:18,267 --> 00:50:19,767
- My fucking fault?

736
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:22,167
- I've got this shitty crappy
life and I come across them.

737
00:50:22,167 --> 00:50:24,633
What the fuck did you
expect me to do with them?

738
00:50:24,633 --> 00:50:25,900
- You're insane.

739
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:27,000
You're insane!

740
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:27,900
- What are you involved in?

741
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:28,733
What?

742
00:50:28,733 --> 00:50:29,900
Fuck that, right?

743
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,167
Where's the money,
have you got the money?

744
00:50:31,167 --> 00:50:32,367
- I spent it.
- You spent it?

745
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:33,833
- Yeah on my
shitty, crappy life.

746
00:50:33,833 --> 00:50:35,100
- On your shitty, crappy life.

747
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,333
- To make it a bit better.

748
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:38,800
- Great.

749
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,000
That's fucking great.

750
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:42,833
- What were you
doing hiding diamonds here?

751
00:50:42,833 --> 00:50:45,067
- My place isn't safe.
- Well, I sold them.

752
00:50:45,067 --> 00:50:45,867
- Great.

753
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:47,833
Well, we need to get 'em back.

754
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:49,400
Where are they?

755
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,700
- Pawn shop.
- Pawn shop, right.

756
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,533
Get your things together.

757
00:50:51,533 --> 00:50:52,833
We're going there now.

758
00:50:52,833 --> 00:50:54,367
- I was just getting
my life back on track.

759
00:50:54,367 --> 00:50:55,367
And then you
started to came back

760
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:57,000
and started to fuck it up again.

761
00:50:57,867 --> 00:50:59,433
- Sallie and Richard's life

762
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:02,167
are in danger right
now, all right?

763
00:51:02,167 --> 00:51:03,500
So you're gonna get
your shit together

764
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,067
and we're leaving now.

765
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,600
Now!

766
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:15,167
- Max, please, stop.

767
00:51:15,167 --> 00:51:16,933
I can't, I can't do it.

768
00:51:16,933 --> 00:51:18,433
He's not gonna give them back.

769
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:19,667
What do you mean he's not
going to give them back?

770
00:51:19,667 --> 00:51:20,367
I'm going to put
a gun to his face.

771
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:21,200
- Oh, fuck!

772
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,500
This is...

773
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,333
I'm just gonna go, okay?

774
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,000
Please.

775
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,633
- Look, they're
conflict diamonds.

776
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:27,833
He has bought conflict diamonds.

777
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:28,967
He's not gonna call the cops.

778
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:30,067
- I can't, Max, okay?

779
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,567
Please.

780
00:51:31,567 --> 00:51:32,700
- Don't worry about Richard,
don't worry about your sister.

781
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:35,000
Give me your car keys.

782
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,833
Good on ya.

783
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:46,300
- Sweetie.

784
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,600
It's okay, darling.

785
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,300
It's okay, darling.

786
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,433
Oh, shhh!

787
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:54,133
Shhh, it's okay.

788
00:51:54,133 --> 00:51:56,067
Are you all right, darling?

789
00:51:56,067 --> 00:51:57,567
Ohh.

790
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,600
Shhh.

791
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,433
- Yes, Jacky.

792
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,967
- Don't you fucking move.

793
00:52:26,867 --> 00:52:27,667
- Max.

794
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:28,700
- Richard about?

795
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:33,867
- Um, yeah, you might
find him down there.

796
00:52:36,633 --> 00:52:38,900
- No, he's not in the car.

797
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,133
Is he not home?

798
00:52:40,133 --> 00:52:41,633
- He hasn't set foot
inside this house

799
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:43,233
for over three months, Max.

800
00:52:43,233 --> 00:52:44,700
- Really?

801
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,700
- There's a lot of
things Richard hasn't told you.

802
00:52:48,867 --> 00:52:50,167
- Mummy?

803
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:53,400
- Is Felix okay?

804
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,300
- He's fine.

805
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:56,500
- Okay, um.

806
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,600
Do you mind if I hang
about and wait for him?

807
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:01,933
- Sure.

808
00:53:01,933 --> 00:53:03,467
- Thank you.

809
00:53:03,467 --> 00:53:04,800
- And when you see him, tell
him to move his bloody car.

810
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,733
It's embarrassing.

811
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,867
- I want Sallie and Richard.

812
00:53:49,967 --> 00:53:52,400
I'm not fucking around!
- Neither are we!

813
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:54,667
- The diamonds, mate.

814
00:53:58,367 --> 00:53:59,200
- Hey!

815
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,900
Richard, Sallie, no tricks.

816
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,167
I want my girlfriend.

817
00:54:06,167 --> 00:54:07,933
- I told you so
many fucking times!

818
00:54:07,933 --> 00:54:09,600
We do not have her.

819
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,900
- Police!

820
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,267
Police, don't move!

821
00:54:20,433 --> 00:54:21,467
- Gun shots being fired.

822
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,333
Suspects heading
north on Sutton Ave.

823
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,767
- What do you want, mate?

824
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:16,867
- Look, I'm really
sorry I left you, mate.

825
00:55:19,167 --> 00:55:20,033
- Take some time.

826
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:26,033
- Are you okay?

827
00:55:26,033 --> 00:55:27,267
- I'll survive.

828
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:45,867
- You and Monica?

829
00:55:47,933 --> 00:55:48,767
- Divorced.

830
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:51,600
- You didn't want to tell me?

831
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,600
- You didn't ask.

832
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,967
- And what, you don't have
anywhere else to live?

833
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:02,467
- No, not really.

834
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:09,300
At least I get to see
Felix this way, eh?

835
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:18,000
- You really are
fucked up, aren't you?

836
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,433
- What?

837
00:56:20,433 --> 00:56:21,433
- I'm leaving.

838
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:22,500
- Yeah right, mate, okay.

839
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:24,167
Hey!
- I'm leaving.

840
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:25,500
- What the fuck's
wrong with your head?

841
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,500
- I don't know.

842
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,100
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

843
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,167
I should be pissed at you.

844
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:31,767
You put my life in danger.

845
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:34,133
- I know man, I'm fucked!

846
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:36,333
Sallie knew it, everyone
fucking knows it.

847
00:56:36,333 --> 00:56:38,133
- Don't, don't do
the Poor Max routine.

848
00:56:38,133 --> 00:56:39,400
- I'm not, mate, I'm not.

849
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,867
- Giving me shit, mate.
- I'm not.

850
00:56:42,067 --> 00:56:44,533
I'm just telling you to
get out of my life, man.

851
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:50,500
- You know, mate, I realize
what you're really good at.

852
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,733
Weak as piss,
mate, weak as piss.

853
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:29,533
- Is this yours?
- Yeah.

854
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,033
A friend gave it to me.

855
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:34,733
- This friend of yours,
is he in the photo?

856
00:57:34,733 --> 00:57:35,567
- That bloke.

857
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:39,700
- Good friends, are you?

858
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:40,733
- More acquaintances.

859
00:57:47,933 --> 00:57:48,767
Oi.

860
00:57:55,033 --> 00:57:56,200
- What'd you do to Fagan, man?

861
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,233
- Sorry?

862
00:57:57,233 --> 00:57:59,333
- Is there something you want?

863
00:57:59,333 --> 00:58:00,933
- Look, I've lost his details
and I desperately need

864
00:58:00,933 --> 00:58:02,067
to get in touch with him.

865
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:03,333
Can you help me?

866
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:05,567
- Well, why don't
you give me yours

867
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:08,033
and if I see him
I'll let him know.

868
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:10,567
- Look, I gave you
an address and a gun

869
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,067
and next thing I know she
got her brains blown out.

870
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:14,600
Don't take a super sleuth to
see a connection now, huh?

871
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,567
- You know, I really
wanted to surprise him.

872
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:21,300
- He really
doesn't like surprises.

873
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,967
- I didn't kill her.

874
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:25,167
- Look, what do you
want from us, man?

875
00:58:25,167 --> 00:58:26,700
Why are you pressin' us?

876
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,000
- The blokes who did kill
Fagan, I need to find 'em.

877
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:31,467
- Are you gonna give
me your details?

878
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:32,700
Because if you're not,

879
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,267
there's nothing more
I can do for you.

880
00:59:05,967 --> 00:59:07,633
- I thought I told
you to piss off.

881
00:59:07,633 --> 00:59:10,700
- Well, my
hearing's going, I reckon.

882
00:59:11,867 --> 00:59:13,067
- You want me to
say it out louder?

883
00:59:13,067 --> 00:59:14,533
- Mate, I've known
you since I was seven.

884
00:59:14,533 --> 00:59:17,400
You reckon you're going to
get rid of me that easily, eh?

885
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,233
- Ricky...

886
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:25,567
Go back to Monica.

887
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,633
- She doesn't want me.

888
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:30,767
- Neither do I.

889
00:59:36,933 --> 00:59:38,900
- I'm sorry I've been
such a shit to you.

890
00:59:48,733 --> 00:59:49,567
You okay?

891
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:53,700
- I don't know what to do.

892
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,033
- It'll be okay.

893
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,833
- Just go, okay?

894
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:21,967
I don't want you here, I
don't want you in my life.

895
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:41,133
Okay.

896
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,333
If anything happens
to you, not my fault.

897
01:01:26,233 --> 01:01:27,067
Hey!

898
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:32,100
- So that's how it's
going to be, is it?

899
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:34,833
- Just need to know
if you have my woman.

900
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:36,767
- What's with this chick?

901
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:37,733
You're a dumb fuck.

902
01:01:37,733 --> 01:01:39,167
I don't have your bitch.

903
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,467
- Calm down, calm down!

904
01:01:40,467 --> 01:01:42,600
Hey Max--
- Stay there.

905
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,867
You stay there.

906
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,400
- You don't know
what you're doing.

907
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,367
You're fuckin' in
over your head.

908
01:01:47,367 --> 01:01:48,867
So why don't you leave it

909
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:51,167
and piss off before you
get yourself killed?

910
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:52,433
- Don't come any closer.

911
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:53,667
You tell me what's
happened to Sallie.

912
01:01:53,667 --> 01:01:54,767
- You're weak as piss.

913
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:56,067
Give us the fucking gun, eh?

914
01:01:56,067 --> 01:01:56,833
- No!

915
01:01:56,833 --> 01:01:57,633
Fuck you!

916
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,767
- We gotta go.

917
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,400
This is bad, mate, really bad.

918
01:02:23,133 --> 01:02:26,567
All right, I'll get
the car, you stay here.

919
01:02:42,033 --> 01:02:43,867
Just help me.

920
01:02:43,867 --> 01:02:45,733
- I don't know if
this is a good idea.

921
01:02:45,733 --> 01:02:47,000
- Are you kidding, mate?

922
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,367
You were holding him
when he was shot.

923
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,200
Do you know how easy it
is to link him to us?

924
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,967
Not fucking around
mate, let's go!

925
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,867
- I don't
think anyone saw us.

926
01:03:21,867 --> 01:03:24,833
- Mate, have you
fucking watched TV?

927
01:03:24,833 --> 01:03:28,767
Shit, they're gonna trace
to us like fucking CSI.

928
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,667
- Let's just get this
fucking body out of the boot.

929
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,500
- Yeah.

930
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:56,400
- Oh!

931
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,100
I think you're gonna win.

932
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:00,967
Your go.

933
01:05:00,967 --> 01:05:02,467
- I want number six.

934
01:05:02,467 --> 01:05:03,667
- Number six.

935
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:06,033
Yes!

936
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:09,167
One, two, three,
you can jump four.

937
01:05:12,267 --> 01:05:13,633
- I wanna see Mummy.

938
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,267
- Aren't we having fun?

939
01:05:21,267 --> 01:05:23,100
- But I still miss Mummy.

940
01:05:26,567 --> 01:05:29,500
- Violet, listen to me, darling.

941
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,633
Please sweetie,
sweetheart, stop.

942
01:05:33,967 --> 01:05:35,033
I need you to listen.

943
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:38,967
Mummy's not your real mummy.

944
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:42,433
I am.

945
01:05:45,133 --> 01:05:47,367
Do you understand, sweetie?

946
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,433
I know it's confusing, darling.

947
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:52,533
Hey?

948
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,467
- I wanna go home.

949
01:06:01,367 --> 01:06:03,967
- Don't you want to
spend some more time with me?

950
01:06:56,333 --> 01:06:59,533
- You won't go on your own
because you know I'm right.

951
01:06:59,533 --> 01:07:02,133
- She gave her to me.
- You took her away.

952
01:07:03,433 --> 01:07:05,300
- She couldn't have
looked after her.

953
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,667
- She just wants to
start caring for her child.

954
01:07:16,667 --> 01:07:19,100
- Well, she didn't
care at the time.

955
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,800
- She didn't know
what she wanted.

956
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,033
We need to pull together.

957
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:31,067
- This family has
never been together.

958
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:45,700
- You know I'm leaving?

959
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,533
- Yeah.

960
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,533
- I can't stay.

961
01:07:52,533 --> 01:07:53,367
- Jacky,

962
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:55,967
what's happening?

963
01:07:56,967 --> 01:07:58,533
You're using again, huh?
- No.

964
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:01,433
Just a few times.

965
01:08:01,433 --> 01:08:03,067
It's been fucking tough, okay?

966
01:08:03,067 --> 01:08:03,900
- Yeah.

967
01:08:04,867 --> 01:08:05,700
It's been tough.

968
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,967
- Max, we could be together.

969
01:08:08,967 --> 01:08:10,567
- I'm going, Jacky.
- Wait.

970
01:08:11,467 --> 01:08:12,300
Max, please.

971
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,267
Look, please.

972
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:18,067
- I made my decision
back then, okay?

973
01:08:21,633 --> 01:08:23,333
- I'm leaving
tomorrow with Violet.

974
01:08:30,367 --> 01:08:31,667
- Is Violet your daughter?

975
01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:35,300
- No.

976
01:08:37,467 --> 01:08:38,300
She's ours.

977
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,667
- Hello?

978
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:28,400
- I'm keeping her.

979
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,767
- I'll call the police.

980
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:32,800
- Do it.

981
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:34,167
She's my child.

982
01:09:34,167 --> 01:09:35,700
- She's mine legally.

983
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,367
- You took
advantage of me.

984
01:09:37,367 --> 01:09:38,633
- Advantage?

985
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:40,533
You gave birth to her
on the bathroom floor.

986
01:09:40,533 --> 01:09:41,867
We've all lived
through your drugs.

987
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:43,500
I'm not allowing Violet
to go through it too.

988
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:44,967
- I have been clean for a year.

989
01:09:44,967 --> 01:09:46,600
I've got a job and a unit.

990
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,000
I'm ready to look after her.

991
01:09:49,433 --> 01:09:50,867
- Have you told her anything?

992
01:09:52,467 --> 01:09:53,300
- I will.

993
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,067
- Sallie is missing.

994
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:00,200
Why are you doing this now?

995
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,367
- Darling, stay away from that.

996
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,800
Sweetie, get away.

997
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:03,967
- Is she okay?

998
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:05,567
Let me speak to her.
- She's fine.

999
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:12,900
I need your signature
to get Violet a visa.

1000
01:10:12,900 --> 01:10:13,733
- What?

1001
01:10:15,400 --> 01:10:17,100
Never, I'll never sign it.

1002
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,200
- You will, or you'll
never see her again.

1003
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,200
- Jacky, please.

1004
01:10:22,767 --> 01:10:24,367
Please just bring her home.

1005
01:10:26,433 --> 01:10:27,267
- I just,

1006
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:30,033
I just want my daughter.

1007
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:33,267
- Well, I'm not
letting you take her.

1008
01:10:42,733 --> 01:10:44,300
- Sweetie, get away.

1009
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:55,733
- Hello.

1010
01:10:55,733 --> 01:10:56,967
Whoa!

1011
01:10:56,967 --> 01:10:59,033
What's going on?

1012
01:10:59,033 --> 01:11:00,667
Darling, are you okay?

1013
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,600
Can you wait outside?

1014
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,600
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1015
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,000
- Just wait there, okay?

1016
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,333
Jacky?

1017
01:11:28,733 --> 01:11:29,567
Jacky?

1018
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:40,100
Jacky?

1019
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:49,167
Jacky.

1020
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:55,367
Ohh.

1021
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:01,900
Oh, shit.

1022
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:27,500
- Max.

1023
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,333
Max!

1024
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,733
We need to talk.

1025
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,300
- We think we may
have found Sallie.

1026
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,900
- A body washed up at Bondi.

1027
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,800
We think it's her.

1028
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:09,267
- I didn't do enough.

1029
01:14:09,267 --> 01:14:10,800
- We did
everything we could, mate.

1030
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:12,567
- I could've done more.

1031
01:14:12,567 --> 01:14:15,633
- There was nothing else
we could have done, Max.

1032
01:14:19,233 --> 01:14:21,533
- I just,

1033
01:14:21,533 --> 01:14:22,533
I'm gonna...

1034
01:14:23,833 --> 01:14:26,900
I just really, really
wanna hurt him.

1035
01:14:48,133 --> 01:14:49,100
- I'm leaving now.

1036
01:14:50,333 --> 01:14:52,333
- What, where?
- Just help me.

1037
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:55,967
- Jacky, I'm kinda
busy right now.

1038
01:14:55,967 --> 01:14:57,567
- You have my car and you
are bringing it here now

1039
01:14:57,567 --> 01:14:59,467
to get me and your daughter.
- Jacky?

1040
01:15:01,933 --> 01:15:04,433
Jacky, we know you're in there!

1041
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,400
Jacky!

1042
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:39,733
Violet!
- Mummy!

1043
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:43,300
- Darling, please!

1044
01:15:44,167 --> 01:15:45,633
- Mummy!

1045
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,867
- Just go.

1046
01:17:25,133 --> 01:17:26,233
- Here we go.

1047
01:17:44,533 --> 01:17:46,300
- I've been followed.

1048
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:25,700
- Move.

1049
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,333
- Hey, it's all right.

1050
01:19:59,367 --> 01:20:00,900
Listen, are you okay?

1051
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:01,767
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1052
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:03,000
- Yes, yes.

1053
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
- Let's get the
fuck out of this.

1054
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,500
- Yes, yes.
- Let's go.

1055
01:20:41,333 --> 01:20:42,500
- Don't try and stop me.

1056
01:20:44,633 --> 01:20:46,600
- Jacky, what about Violet?

1057
01:20:54,633 --> 01:20:57,967
Does the name Anais
mean anything to you?

1058
01:21:06,567 --> 01:21:08,567
- I really want you
out of my life, Max.

1059
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,233
- Did you know Sallie
had an abortion?

1060
01:21:17,967 --> 01:21:19,900
Jacky, did Sallie
know Violet was ours?

1061
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,400
Did you tell her?

1062
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,900
Did you, Jacky?

1063
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:25,767
- It's me.

1064
01:21:25,767 --> 01:21:26,767
Are you alone?

1065
01:21:26,767 --> 01:21:29,267
- Yeah, what's wrong?

1066
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:37,067
- Come on, I need to know!

1067
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:54,933
- You know what?

1068
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:56,933
I think I'm gonna take
you home to Irene.

1069
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:00,167
- Can't we stay
a little longer please?

1070
01:26:00,167 --> 01:26:01,800
- That's a
good idea actually.

1071
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,600
We'll just stay a
little bit longer.
