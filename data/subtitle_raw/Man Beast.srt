1
00:00:00,691 --> 00:00:04,024
(gentle, ominous music)

2
00:00:08,082 --> 00:00:11,010
- [Narrator] The mysterious Himalayas,

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,393
spanning the entire distance
between India and Tibet,

4
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,230
somewhere up in this vast,
desolate section of our world

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,530
live a strange species

6
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,803
whose existence has baffled
science for centuries.

7
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,370
In recent years, many
anthropologists have pondered

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,513
the new reports of these creatures.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,113
The question is always the same,

10
00:00:39,323 --> 00:00:40,787
are they man or beast?

11
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:46,383
(dramatic, foreboding music)

12
00:02:07,509 --> 00:02:09,000
- There's no one here.

13
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,440
- Oh I just hope I can find a bed.

14
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,930
- I'd rather find Erickson.

15
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,133
I didn't see his outfit.

16
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,710
I have hope we're not late.

17
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,899
- If he's left, we'll have to follow him.

18
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:21,599
- Well that's easily said, Connie.

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,813
- We've come this far, we'll keep going.

20
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,451
- Speak English?

21
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,650
- Little.

22
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,970
- We're looking for Dr.
Erickson, is he here?

23
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,410
- Gone.

24
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,243
- [Trevor] When?

25
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:36,304
- [Man] Tomorrow.

26
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:38,010
- [Trevor] (chuckles) You mean yesterday.

27
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,850
Do you know where?

28
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:40,683
- Mountain.

29
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,170
- Hello.

30
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,630
What are you doing up here?

31
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,840
- I'm just too tired to go into it.

32
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,220
- I'm Trevor Hudson.

33
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,470
This is Connie Hayward.

34
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,920
- Steve Cameron.

35
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,940
Hayward?

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,040
I met a man named Hayward,
Dr. James Hayward here,

37
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,930
a few weeks back.

38
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,580
- My brother,

39
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,210
and the reason we're here.

40
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,860
- Oh he left 10 days ago to set up camp

41
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,280
for the Erickson expedition.

42
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,760
- And Professor Erickson?

43
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,473
- [Steve] Erickson left yesterday morning.

44
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,350
- Then we'll have to follow him.

45
00:03:10,763 --> 00:03:11,596
- You mean you don't know the purpose

46
00:03:11,596 --> 00:03:13,240
of Dr. Erickson's expedition?

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,300
- Only that he's been
preparing it for years.

48
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,260
- Well, his purpose is to capture

49
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,160
one of the abominable snowmen.

50
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,824
That's what the natives call the Yeti.

51
00:03:22,824 --> 00:03:24,120
They're a kind of people
covered with hair,

52
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,300
supposedly living above
the 21,000 foot level.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,384
- Covered with hair?

54
00:03:29,384 --> 00:03:32,087
- [Connie] What do you
mean, a kind of people?

55
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:34,687
- Nobody seems to know
whether they're man or beast.

56
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:37,390
Everyone thought they were a fable

57
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,590
until some famous explorers
found traces of them

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,790
just before World War I.

59
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,650
Since then, many people have
claimed to have seen them.

60
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,270
- Did you know about this?

61
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,810
- Well I knew Dr. Erickson
was hunting snowmen,

62
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,460
but I thought they were
fossil relics of the Ice Age.

63
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,790
Do you believe these stories?

64
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:58,260
- Well Erickson's a famous anthropologist.

65
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,710
- Are these Yetis dangerous?

66
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,150
- I've seen four expeditions
go up in search of the Yeti

67
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,290
and each has lost at least one man.

68
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,050
- Well that settles it, Connie,

69
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm not letting you endanger
your life by going any farther.

70
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,100
- You can't go beyond this point anyway,

71
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,590
you won't be able to get guides,
you'll never make it alone.

72
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,630
- Why can't we get guides?

73
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,550
- They won't go out on anything
connected with a Yeti hunt

74
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,930
unless a certain guide
named Varga leads them.

75
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,210
And Erickson's got him.

76
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,953
- Mr. Cameron, do you know
where Erickson's camp will be?

77
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,470
- I have a rough idea.

78
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,070
- [Connie] Would you lead us up?

79
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:36,120
- You know what you're asking?

80
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,260
- Mr. Cameron,

81
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,350
I'm willing to pay any
price for your assistance.

82
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:42,680
It's urgent that I get to my brother.

83
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,780
- We can get lost up there
and they'd never find us.

84
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,470
- I'll have to risk that.

85
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,840
- You're a very determined
person, Miss Hayward.

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,283
- Yes, Mr. Cameron, determined
to save my brother's life.

87
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:58,290
(gentle, ominous music)
- Well,

88
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,240
we'd have to leave right away

89
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,720
if we expect to catch Erickson
before he reaches deep snow.

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,553
- You'll go.

91
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:08,213
- I know you two would
never make it alone.

92
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:11,935
- Thank you, Mr. Cameron.

93
00:05:11,935 --> 00:05:13,435
I'm very grateful.

94
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:19,874
(dramatic, ominous music)
(wind hissing)

95
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,279
(rocks rumbling)
(dramatic music)

96
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:03,567
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

97
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:27,430
- We could make another couple
of miles before nightfall.

98
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,863
- Let's camp here and
push ourselves tomorrow.

99
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,933
- We'll never catch up
with Erickson sitting here.

100
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:38,500
- I can't go another
step. (labored breathing)

101
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,800
- This is Hayward's party,

102
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:42,663
she says stay, we stay.

103
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,723
- We'll go on.

104
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:49,130
- Connie, this is stupid,
you're killing yourself.

105
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,165
- We'll keep going.

106
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:53,365
(Trevor sighs)

107
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:58,365
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

108
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,530
- If we're lucky, we
may see them tomorrow.

109
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:29,270
- You've been saying that for two days.

110
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,980
- I wasn't saying it to hear myself talk.

111
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,950
I don't enjoy this pushing
any more than you do,

112
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,620
but it's our only hope
to overtake Erickson.

113
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,210
- Don't blame Steve, Hud,

114
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,610
I'm the one who's doing the pushing.

115
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,540
We'll stay with our
schedule, daylight to dusk.

116
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,130
You might as well take it gracefully.

117
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,900
- If this isn't the weirdest nonsense,

118
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,540
somebody thinks he saw
a Yeti 40 years ago,

119
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,830
this gives Erickson
the idea to capture one

120
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,190
and I find myself stuck up
in the wiles of the Himalayas

121
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,490
just because your brother happened to--

122
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,323
- Hud!

123
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,663
- I'm sorry,

124
00:10:03,221 --> 00:10:05,070
but you've got to admit,
it doesn't make much sense.

125
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,250
- What do you want us to do, turn back?

126
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:10,220
Look Hud, I didn't ask
you to come on this trip,

127
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,660
you volunteered.

128
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,493
If you wanna turn back, go ahead.

129
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:21,226
(Connie sighs)

130
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,480
- He may be getting a
touch of the altitude.

131
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,877
It affects some people.

132
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:28,177
- He has a touch of
feeling sorry for himself.

133
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,300
I guess you never really know people

134
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:35,110
unless you go through
something like this with them.

135
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,690
- He'll come around.

136
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,710
You better get some rest.

137
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,643
- Tired as I've been, I can't sleep.

138
00:10:42,813 --> 00:10:44,470
- (laughs) Guilty conscience?

139
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,773
- My brother, Jim,

140
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,910
ever since you mentioned these snowmen,

141
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,460
I've been all the more worried.

142
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,571
What's your theory about them?

143
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,750
- I don't have any.

144
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,730
All I know is what I've read
and heard from the natives.

145
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,490
- Has anyone ever had a good look at them?

146
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,680
- I talked to a man once
who was supposed to have

147
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,130
seen one through his glasses.

148
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,670
He claimed they walked upright like a man.

149
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,280
- How can anyone live in that cold?

150
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,160
- I can't answer that.

151
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,900
Nothing grows up there.

152
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,150
Too high for animal life.

153
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,110
Your guess is as good as anybody's.

154
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:26,940
- Dr. Erickson really
thinks he'll contact one?

155
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,792
- He certainly hopes to.

156
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,280
I had a long talk with him one night.

157
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,649
- Do you really think we'll
catch up with them tomorrow?

158
00:11:34,649 --> 00:11:37,240
- Oh I figure we picked up a day on them.

159
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:42,773
(wind hissing)
(dramatic, orchestral music)

160
00:11:42,773 --> 00:11:47,506
(Connie sighs)
(labored breathing)

161
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:52,506
(wind hissing)
(dramatic, orchestral music)

162
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,300
- Take another look.

163
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,350
- What good'll it do?

164
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,860
Even if you see them, we
can't hail them to stop.

165
00:12:01,729 --> 00:12:03,577
- We'd better find them soon

166
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,220
or we've made this trip
up here for nothing.

167
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,053
- Why?

168
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,033
- Because, all this snow,

169
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:13,320
moving six different directions.

170
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,310
- How could I have gotten
mixed up in this thing?

171
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,910
- Because you wanted to help me.

172
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,019
Or so you say.

173
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,198
(Trevor exhales)

174
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:26,790
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

175
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,030
- I got 'em.

176
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,140
- Where?

177
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,100
How far.

178
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,200
- Straight over there.

179
00:12:32,276 --> 00:12:37,276
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

180
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,620
- Is there any way to signal them?

181
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,177
- They may hear this.

182
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:46,335
(gun blasts)

183
00:12:46,335 --> 00:12:47,456
Did they hear it?

184
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:49,193
- They haven't turned.

185
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:51,361
(gun blasts)

186
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:56,361
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

187
00:12:56,961 --> 00:12:57,794
- Doctor,

188
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,960
I hear a gun shot.

189
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:01,793
Listen.

190
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:06,384
(distant gun blasts)

191
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:07,884
- That was a shot.

192
00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:10,220
Who can it be?

193
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,433
No one hunts this high.

194
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:17,376
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

195
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:24,126
- They're trying to find
us with glasses, look.

196
00:13:24,126 --> 00:13:29,126
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

197
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:32,070
- They're trying to signal us.

198
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:35,508
There's a woman.

199
00:13:35,508 --> 00:13:37,464
Now who can they be?

200
00:13:37,464 --> 00:13:42,464
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

201
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,963
Well, they certainly want us.

202
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,690
We'll wait for them.

203
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,533
- Are they far?

204
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,770
They're waiting.

205
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:52,603
- Thank God.

206
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,627
- Come on, let's move.

207
00:13:58,627 --> 00:14:03,627
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(wind hissing)

208
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,770
- Cameron, what are you doing up here?

209
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:07,980
- Miss Hayward.

210
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,813
- How do you do.
- How do you do, Doctor?

211
00:14:08,813 --> 00:14:09,830
- And Mr. Hudson, Doctor.

212
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,663
- How do you do?

213
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,390
- My pleasure, Doctor.

214
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,780
- Miss Hayward will do all the explaining.

215
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,613
- Hayward?

216
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:15,620
Are you related to Jim?

217
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,453
- My brother.

218
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:18,360
- You've come way up here to see him?

219
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,030
- I have to.

220
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:22,180
But I didn't quite plan it like this.

221
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,600
We expected to find you in Kalpa.

222
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,750
We missed you there,
missed you at the outpost

223
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,190
and here we are.

224
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,200
- Well we'll both see him soon,

225
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,180
we're not very far from camp.

226
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,830
Lucky we heard that shot.

227
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,600
We'll be in the snow in a few hours,

228
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,810
you never could have caught us.

229
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,310
Kheon, make coffee.

230
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:43,610
We might as well camp right here.

231
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,028
Here, let me help you with your things.

232
00:14:46,028 --> 00:14:47,163
- Thank you.

233
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:49,746
(wind hissing)

234
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:58,793
- So when I heard that
new tracks had treaded,

235
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,530
and there were fresh
rumors about the Yeti,

236
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:04,273
I decided to see for myself.

237
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,950
- You really believe it.

238
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,880
- It's hard not to when so many famous men

239
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,823
stake their reputations on the fact.

240
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,450
- Are they really covered with fur?

241
00:15:15,643 --> 00:15:18,120
- Not fur, hair.

242
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,620
Fur has no root, but hair does.

243
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,240
We've definitely established that the Yeti

244
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,607
are covered with a hair quite
similar to our own. (grunts)

245
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,623
Here's the general conception
of most scientists.

246
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:38,270
- [Connie] More beast than man.

247
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,583
- Maybe to your eyes,

248
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,543
but I believe it's human.

249
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,193
- You really wanna capture that?

250
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,700
- I think that I'd die happy

251
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,873
if I could study them.

252
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:57,583
They may be the missing link.

253
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,493
If they are,

254
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,773
we've solved 1,000
mysteries about you and me.

255
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,260
- I'd hate to tangle
with one on a dark night.

256
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,981
- Oh I don't think you have
to worry about that. (laughs)

257
00:16:10,981 --> 00:16:12,880
- I wish I hadn't seen that sketch.

258
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,400
I don't think I'll ever sleep again.

259
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,910
- Oh nonsense, they're
probably just simple people.

260
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,280
- People?

261
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,312
Just hope I don't dream tonight.

262
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:25,260
(doctor laughs)

263
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:28,541
- Well, I guess we'd all better turn in.

264
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:32,973
- Yes.
(doctor grunts)

265
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:37,973
(gentle, dramatic music)
(hissing wind)

266
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,323
- Stop here.

267
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,293
Tomorrow big climb.

268
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,837
- [Doctor] There is is, Yeti country.

269
00:17:11,837 --> 00:17:13,987
- As far as I'm concerned,
you can have it.

270
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,080
- If we're lucky and capture one,

271
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,670
this trip could make you famous.

272
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,957
- [Steve] You can have the
fame. I'll take some hot coffee.

273
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,613
- Magnificent country.

274
00:17:30,537 --> 00:17:32,937
It seems to fascinate you
as much as it does me.

275
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,980
- I'm not going up there.

276
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:38,890
- I didn't think I'd make that last hill.

277
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,730
It was easy for you.

278
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,720
A nice rest and--

279
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,553
- No.

280
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:45,417
It's not the climbing, it,

281
00:17:46,748 --> 00:17:47,581
it's the Yeti.

282
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:50,530
I have a feeling--

283
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,083
- Come on, Hudson, we need a drink.

284
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:59,229
(dramatic, orchestral music)

285
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,660
- I saw him, Steve,
there's something wrong.

286
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,620
I felt it all day.

287
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,720
- Nonsense, Connie, I can
understand Hud cracking, but--

288
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,170
- He's watching us right now.

289
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:29,419
(wind hissing)
(dramatic, orchestral music)

290
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:39,240
Did you see that?

291
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,057
He knows we're talking about him.

292
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,343
- I'll speak to Erickson
when I get a chance.

293
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,343
- Have you seen much of him before?

294
00:18:48,343 --> 00:18:49,720
- He's one of the guys
that works for Varga.

295
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,077
- What about this Varga?

296
00:18:51,077 --> 00:18:52,620
Can he be trusted?

297
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,567
- Everyone hires him.

298
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:55,470
- And something always happens,

299
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,820
someone always gets killed.

300
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,010
- I'll see what I can find out.

301
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,660
Not a word of this to the others.

302
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,130
I'll keep my eye on the
guy tomorrow as we go up.

303
00:19:08,586 --> 00:19:13,586
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

304
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,700
- The more I see of this
country, (labored breathing)

305
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,193
the more I'm convinced
the Yeti are a myth.

306
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:04,213
Look, what could live
in a place like that?

307
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,380
- That's part of the mystery.

308
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,230
- What about you?

309
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:09,900
Ever see a Yeti?

310
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,800
- No see.

311
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,200
- Ever meet anybody who did?

312
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,763
- See Yeti,

313
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:20,043
die.

314
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,453
- Let's move on.

315
00:21:26,427 --> 00:21:31,427
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

316
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,163
- I wonder where they made camp.

317
00:21:59,163 --> 00:22:00,193
I don't see it.

318
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,730
- Camp.

319
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,580
- They were supposed to set up tents.

320
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:08,720
Let's have a look.

321
00:22:10,111 --> 00:22:15,111
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

322
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:46,031
(dramatic, foreboding music)
(hissing wind)

323
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,393
- Nothing.

324
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,160
This didn't happen today.

325
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,830
How do you figure it, Doc?

326
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,040
- I'm baffled.

327
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,363
Everything's ripped apart.

328
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,526
- It'll be getting dark pretty soon.

329
00:23:19,526 --> 00:23:20,430
If we're going to be stuck,

330
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,810
we may as well be stuck comfortably.

331
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,968
Better give me a hand setting up camp.

332
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:28,356
- All right, get that. (grunts)

333
00:23:28,356 --> 00:23:33,356
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

334
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,260
- Well we're in good shape,

335
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,230
guides took off during the
night, left us up here.

336
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,063
- What?

337
00:23:45,063 --> 00:23:46,270
- They deserted.

338
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:48,700
Now we're iced laden up here
with no one to lead us back.

339
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,130
- Where's Steve?

340
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,930
- Oh he and Erickson went off this morning

341
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,530
to see if they could find
any sign of Jim and Varga.

342
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,833
This whole trip was a blunder.

343
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,920
- If you felt that way,
why did you come with me?

344
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,270
- Because I thought I could
talk some sense into you.

345
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,440
- Oh look, Hud, this trip has
proved we'll never get along.

346
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,569
It's been one continual argument
ever since we left home.

347
00:24:12,569 --> 00:24:15,152
(hissing wind)

348
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:36,008
(match clicks)

349
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,591
(hissing wind)

350
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:45,597
(men exhale)

351
00:24:45,597 --> 00:24:49,120
- Funny we don't see a
mark, tracks, something.

352
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,420
How do you figure it, Doc?

353
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,190
- I've been afraid to mention it.

354
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,465
- You believe the Yeti got Jim and Varga.

355
00:24:56,465 --> 00:24:57,880
- Is there any other explanation?

356
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,570
- I just can't believe it.

357
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,000
We'd better get back.

358
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,070
What do we tell Connie?

359
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:05,397
- Just keep the Yeti out
of it, no use worrying her.

360
00:25:12,998 --> 00:25:17,998
(hissing wind)
(dramatic, foreboding music)

361
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,588
- These are the worst (mumbles)

362
00:25:28,588 --> 00:25:29,508
- Varga!

363
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:31,780
- Doctor Erickson, it's good to see you.

364
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,780
Mr. Cameron, we meet again.

365
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,780
I'm glad you two appeared,

366
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,630
Miss Hayward and Mr. Hudson
have been quite concerned.

367
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:39,990
- Do you know where Jim is?

368
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,120
- He doesn't.

369
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,420
He's as puzzled as we are.

370
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,260
- Weren't you taking,

371
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,010
didn't you leave the camp together?

372
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:48,930
- He left alone.

373
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,230
There had been quite a snowfall that night

374
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,020
and I thought I might
find some fresh tracks.

375
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,230
When I returned that afternoon,

376
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,823
I found the camp as you had.

377
00:25:58,008 --> 00:26:00,090
I've been looking ever since.

378
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:01,850
- He must have left
tracks in the heavy snow.

379
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,000
- I tracked him around to the
east side of the west block,

380
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,210
but beyond that point, the wind
had obliterated everything.

381
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:10,420
- Mr. Varga hasn't given up hope.

382
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,680
He says there's a good chance

383
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,100
Jim might have holed up somewhere.

384
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,590
- He was anxious to leave,
too anxious I thought.

385
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:21,370
Maybe he stumbled onto
something and just kept going.

386
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:23,360
- Knowing we'd look for him.

387
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,720
- [Varga] As we surly will.

388
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,710
- May I have a word with you alone, Varga?

389
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,320
- If Miss Hayward will excuse me?

390
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,300
- Of course.

391
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,640
- We'll make a thorough
search for him in the morning.

392
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,373
God willing, we'll find him.

393
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:41,610
- Did you find anything, Steve?

394
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,130
- Nothing.

395
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,730
- Do you think there's any hope?

396
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,900
- Connie, I don't know.

397
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,630
- Well I'm not going to give up.

398
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,743
If Jim's out there, I'm going to find him,

399
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,033
dead or alive.

400
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:00,244
- Come in, come in Varga.

401
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,910
(grunts) Can I offer you a drink?

402
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,470
- Never touch a drop.

403
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,443
- Is that so?

404
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:08,820
I always thought you
climbers liked your nip.

405
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,720
- You can't mix mountains and whiskey.

406
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,063
- What about Jim, Varga?

407
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,290
- I wish I knew.

408
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,483
- Any ideas?

409
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,620
- You're referring, of
course, to the Yeti?

410
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,410
- How else can you explain
his complete disappearance?

411
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,150
- As I've told you down below,

412
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,630
I think I've made this trip up here

413
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:28,393
more times than any man alive.

414
00:27:29,407 --> 00:27:30,533
I have yet to see a Yeti or tracks.

415
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,970
- Then how do you explain these rumors?

416
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:34,440
- I don't even try.

417
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,440
Every new rumor means more expeditions

418
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,270
will make the trip up here.

419
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,180
Expeditions are my business.

420
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,013
- As you know,

421
00:27:41,013 --> 00:27:44,853
I've specialized in the evolution
of man for over 30 years.

422
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,960
- I've heard you quoted 1,000 times.

423
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,320
You deal in theory, I deal in fact.

424
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,430
- I can't believe that such men as DuBois,

425
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,010
Wagner, Hale, Bishop,
could be completely wrong.

426
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,083
One of them, yes, but four
distinguished scientists,

427
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,730
each at a different time, different place,

428
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:07,130
have seen the same evidence.

429
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,293
Well tomorrow I shall see for myself.

430
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,860
Any plans as to where we can start?

431
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,540
- I suggest that ridge
that runs north and south.

432
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,860
I've tried to take other
parties over there,

433
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,800
but they didn't like the climb.

434
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,623
- You lead, I'll follow.

435
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,270
Well, see you tomorrow then.

436
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,580
- [Varga] Goodnight, Doctor.

437
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,413
- Goodnight.

438
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:35,974
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

439
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,300
- Might be well for us to split up here.

440
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,150
The doctor and I will take this side,

441
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,670
you three follow that
ridge as far as you can.

442
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,200
You see anything, fire a shot.

443
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,163
We'll do the same.

444
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:38,840
Good luck Miss Hayward.

445
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,280
If you do fire a shot, Mr. Cameron,

446
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,440
make sure you're in the clear.

447
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
It could cause a slide.

448
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,033
Good luck.

449
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,470
- Something about that guy.

450
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,330
- I've been wanting to say
that ever since I met him.

451
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:57,628
- He's tried to be helpful,
what more could he do?

452
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:59,370
- I don't know, Connie, but--

453
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,360
- Come on, this isn't finding Jim.

454
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,193
Let's go.

455
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,420
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

456
00:31:22,015 --> 00:31:25,515
(ominous, dramatic music)

457
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:37,535
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

458
00:32:30,933 --> 00:32:33,384
(Connie sighs)

459
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:34,523
- We'd better get back.

460
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,873
Connie, I hate to quit,
but this seems hopeless.

461
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:44,110
- Steve, I told you it was
urgent that I find Jim,

462
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:47,450
but I didn't explain why.

463
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:51,210
He took some experimental
injection back in the states.

464
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:54,160
After he left, the doctor told me

465
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,010
that if he didn't return from
this high altitude at once,

466
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,843
he would die.

467
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,870
- Didn't he know that?

468
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:02,370
- No, it's a continuous experiment.

469
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,320
This altitude factor was revealed

470
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,130
only after Jim had already
left. (labored breathing)

471
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:08,963
- Connie,

472
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,760
Connie, we've got to go back

473
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,280
and organize a regular rescue party

474
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,580
or we'll never get to Jim.

475
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,964
- What's that supposed to mean?

476
00:33:15,964 --> 00:33:17,803
- It means that I don't trust Varga.

477
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,130
I know what you're thinking,

478
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,963
that I'm afraid,

479
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,063
maybe I am.

480
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,860
But you yourself says
that at least one person

481
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,110
has been lost in every
expedition he has led.

482
00:33:30,793 --> 00:33:33,290
And how do you account for
the two guides disappearing?

483
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:34,780
- I've wondered about that myself.

484
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,630
- You'll notice Varga
hasn't mentioned them.

485
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,630
- You're jumpy, Hud.

486
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,323
- All day I've had the feeling
someone was watching us,

487
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,743
trailing us.

488
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,440
- We'll take the same route back.

489
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,913
If somebody's watching
us, maybe we'll see them.

490
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,993
Come on.

491
00:33:56,607 --> 00:34:01,607
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

492
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:11,490
- From this spot, you can see every local,

493
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,920
where the Yeti are
supposed to have been seen.

494
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,583
That peak was where
DuBois first found tracks.

495
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,153
Over there,

496
00:34:20,153 --> 00:34:22,973
Wagner photographed what
he claims are Yeti tracks.

497
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:27,065
And right down there,

498
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,303
the spot where Bishop claims
he first saw a Yeti last year.

499
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,640
- Weren't you with Bishop?

500
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,463
- I led the trip, I wasn't
with him at the time.

501
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:42,230
- Bishop was a friend
of mine for 20 years.

502
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,520
I don't think he'd make such a statement

503
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,963
without some good reason.

504
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:50,600
By the way, how was he killed?

505
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,231
- We never knew.

506
00:34:52,231 --> 00:34:55,593
A few days later, he
disappeared, much as Jim has.

507
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,450
We searched for days.

508
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,593
- We lost a great man.

509
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,043
I lost a great friend.

510
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,653
Did you ever check his
discovery spot for tracks?

511
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:08,390
- We didn't have much chance,

512
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,700
there was four feet of snow that night.

513
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,510
- Can we pass that spot on the way?

514
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,671
- If we hurry.

515
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:16,780
I don't wanna keep the others waiting,

516
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,380
Miss Hayward is concerned enough as it is.

517
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,340
- I want you to know, Varga,

518
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,553
I appreciate your
concern for Miss Hayward.

519
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,880
- I envy Steve.

520
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,530
They'll make a fine couple.

521
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:30,823
- Steve?

522
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:31,873
I thought it was Hud.

523
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:36,205
- You're not as observant as I am, Doctor.

524
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:42,596
(gentle, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

525
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,960
- Take it easy, Connie,
here they come now.

526
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,923
- Doctor Erickson, did
you find any trace of Jim?

527
00:35:52,923 --> 00:35:54,460
- No I, (labored breathing)

528
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,329
I'm afraid we didn't, I'm sorry.

529
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,270
- Neither did we.

530
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,103
- Where's Hud?

531
00:35:58,103 --> 00:35:59,502
- Hud?

532
00:35:59,502 --> 00:36:00,840
- He was the first one to
climb back to join you.

533
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,940
- We didn't see him.

534
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,980
- Something must have happened.

535
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,590
We'd better get out of there
right away and look for him.

536
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:05,660
- I'll break out the flairs,

537
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,647
it might be dark before we find him.

538
00:36:11,637 --> 00:36:12,940
(Hud shouts)

539
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,670
- Dr. Erickson, Steve, there he is.

540
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:20,858
(Hud shouting)

541
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:26,750
Hud, are you all right?

542
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,780
- Yes Connie, I'm all right.

543
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,773
- What happened, Hud?

544
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,240
- I was climbing over an outcropping

545
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,787
on my way to join you, Doctor,

546
00:36:32,787 --> 00:36:34,340
and I saw some tracks in the snow.

547
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,463
- Tracks?

548
00:36:35,463 --> 00:36:36,510
- I followed them for quite a while

549
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,790
'til they led me to a
large fault in the glacier.

550
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,580
I decided not to go any further alone.

551
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,900
- This is what I've been searching for.

552
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,291
Can you lead us back there, Hud?

553
00:36:43,291 --> 00:36:44,124
- Now?

554
00:36:44,124 --> 00:36:44,957
- Yes.

555
00:36:44,957 --> 00:36:45,850
- It'll soon be dark.

556
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,360
- That's all right, we brought flairs.

557
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,260
Let's get started.

558
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,313
30 years I have waited for this.

559
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:59,267
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

560
00:39:02,846 --> 00:39:06,596
(dramatic, foreboding music)

561
00:39:09,443 --> 00:39:14,443
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

562
00:39:20,873 --> 00:39:24,837
- (screams) Look out!

563
00:39:24,837 --> 00:39:26,685
- Where Hud, where?

564
00:39:26,685 --> 00:39:31,434
- There! (screams)

565
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:36,434
(Connie screams)
(dramatic, orchestral music)

566
00:39:56,095 --> 00:39:57,010
(gun blasts)

567
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,760
(dramatic, foreboding music)

568
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,157
(Hud screaming)

569
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,787
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

570
00:40:25,787 --> 00:40:28,230
- Steve, we've gotta get out of here.

571
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,063
- Erickson won't leave,

572
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,370
he's so steamed up about his
discovery, he's floating.

573
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,840
- Then we'll go alone.

574
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,710
- We can't desert him.

575
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,257
- Varga will stay with him.

576
00:40:36,257 --> 00:40:38,749
- (sighs) That's what I'm afraid of.

577
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:39,661
You know,

578
00:40:39,661 --> 00:40:43,702
I'm beginning to think Hud was
right about a lot of things.

579
00:40:43,702 --> 00:40:44,619
- Poor Hud.

580
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:47,935
(Steve grunts)

581
00:40:47,935 --> 00:40:49,107
If we'd only listened to him.

582
00:40:50,301 --> 00:40:51,790
- This head.

583
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,990
- You're lucky to be
alive after last night.

584
00:40:56,062 --> 00:40:58,363
If I live to be 1,000,
I'll never forget it.

585
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:01,630
- (groans) I know what you mean.

586
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:04,600
I'm going over to see Doc,
talk to him about Varga.

587
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,100
- Is Varga there now?

588
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,750
- I don't know, but if he
is, I'll try to pin him down.

589
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,063
- Don't ever let him
think you suspect him.

590
00:41:11,063 --> 00:41:12,003
- Look Connie,

591
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,290
I'm only concerned about one thing,

592
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,230
getting us out of this place alive.

593
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:19,700
I'll be real cozy with Varga.

594
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,533
Come on.

595
00:41:21,792 --> 00:41:24,375
(hissing wind)

596
00:41:27,481 --> 00:41:29,443
- That's it, they wrote (mumbles)

597
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:30,720
- I've got to talk to you, Doc.

598
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,800
- Therefore, I threw--

599
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,502
- Doc, snap out of it.

600
00:41:34,502 --> 00:41:36,760
- (mutters) Leave me
alone, don't interrupt me.

601
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,340
- Listen Doc, what I've got
to tell you concerns that.

602
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,030
- Steve, don't interrupt me,

603
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:43,953
I'll be hours getting down
what I saw last night.

604
00:41:43,953 --> 00:41:44,786
(Doctor muttering)

605
00:41:44,786 --> 00:41:46,540
- You want to get that back to the states?

606
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,100
- Don't ask me such
questions, of course I do.

607
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,650
- Then put it down and listen to me,

608
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:52,550
and listen closely

609
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,793
or none of us will get out of here alive.

610
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:57,633
- What?

611
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:58,466
- Where's Varga?

612
00:41:58,466 --> 00:41:59,420
- Out there somewhere.

613
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,570
- Watch the flat, if
he comes, let me know.

614
00:42:04,198 --> 00:42:05,560
- What's the matter, Steve,

615
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,750
you act as if you've lost your mind.

616
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,513
- I almost lost my life last night.

617
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,320
I don't wanna go the way Hud did, and Jim.

618
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,070
- You've learned something about Jim?

619
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:17,940
- I learned our chances to
get out aren't worth a nickel.

620
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,130
- Varga says they'll never attack,

621
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,310
they're frightened of guns.

622
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,080
You saw the way they panicked.

623
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,690
- Doc, did you see where
that club came from?

624
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,613
- I didn't even know you were
hit 'til Varga picked you up.

625
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:35,060
- I know there were no
Yeti on that side of me,

626
00:42:35,937 --> 00:42:37,710
but Varga was.

627
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:39,210
- Varga?

628
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:40,593
Why he saved your life.

629
00:42:42,070 --> 00:42:43,690
- And for what reason, I haven't figured.

630
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:46,220
- You should thank God we have Varga,

631
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:49,460
he got us out of there at
the risk of his own life.

632
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,000
You should've seen the
way he intimidated 'em,

633
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,383
literally chased them.

634
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,938
- [Steve] Doc--

635
00:42:55,938 --> 00:42:57,105
- He's coming.

636
00:42:58,787 --> 00:42:59,777
- Not a word about this.

637
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,327
I'm going to play this
straight and you play along.

638
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,498
(dramatic music)

639
00:43:07,610 --> 00:43:10,130
- You're looking much better, Mr. Cameron.

640
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,210
- Doc tells me I owe you my life.

641
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,277
I don't know how much it's worth,

642
00:43:13,277 --> 00:43:14,980
but I'll try to get even some day.

643
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,120
- It was nothing.

644
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,550
I'm sure you would have done the same

645
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,673
if our positions had been reversed.

646
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,690
How are you Miss Hayward?

647
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,390
I trust no ill effects from
that harrowing experience.

648
00:43:30,289 --> 00:43:32,030
- I wouldn't like to go through it again.

649
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:34,000
- Well Doctor, it seems Miss Hayward

650
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,890
and Mr. Cameron don't
share our enthusiasm.

651
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:40,350
I suppose we'd better start
making plans for the trip back.

652
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:42,810
But before we go, would
you like to visit the cave?

653
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:44,940
- I'd like to spend a whole day there.

654
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,130
I have a dozen questions
I'd like answered.

655
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,430
- Whenever you're ready.

656
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,230
- Mind if I go, Varga?

657
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,030
- Of course not, the more the merrier.

658
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,960
- I'd like a day to get over this head.

659
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,270
It's the biggest hangover I ever had.

660
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,350
- Let's make it tomorrow then.

661
00:43:58,350 --> 00:43:59,880
- Tomorrow it is.

662
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:02,230
- Good, I can take a day
to finish up my notes.

663
00:44:03,184 --> 00:44:04,300
- (clears throat) I'll
be back in a moment.

664
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,250
I'm going to take another look outside.

665
00:44:08,695 --> 00:44:11,278
(wind hissing)

666
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,250
- Keep a look out.

667
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,210
Doc, listen to me--

668
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:20,320
- You're not beginning all over again.

669
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,950
- Doc, this man is a phony.

670
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,367
Who or what he is, I don't know,

671
00:44:25,367 --> 00:44:27,680
but he's playing us two
ways from the middle.

672
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,340
- How can you talk such nonsense?

673
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,340
What are you implying?

674
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:33,090
- Because he knew about that cave.

675
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:36,660
- Steve, I'm becoming a
little impatient with you.

676
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:38,780
Varga saved your life.

677
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,830
You should be grateful for that at least.

678
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,390
I want no more of your fanciful illusions.

679
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,573
Now if you don't mind,
I'll get back to my work.

680
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,810
- Okay Doc, have it your way.

681
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:00,860
Come on, Connie.

682
00:45:01,747 --> 00:45:04,330
(wind hissing)

683
00:45:07,536 --> 00:45:09,270
- Steve, what's the matter
with him? Why won't he listen?

684
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,103
- I'm beginning to think

685
00:45:10,103 --> 00:45:12,353
there's something wrong with
all of us for coming up here.

686
00:45:13,226 --> 00:45:14,670
- Are you really going back to that cave?

687
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,503
- You bet I am.

688
00:45:17,367 --> 00:45:18,750
But this time I'll go prepared.

689
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:19,863
- But what about me?

690
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:22,080
- Come along.

691
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,760
- Steve, I couldn't, I just
couldn't go in that cave again.

692
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,060
- I can't let Erickson go alone.

693
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,893
I'm beginning to think

694
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:31,330
Varga is trying to pick
us off one at a time.

695
00:45:31,330 --> 00:45:32,933
First there was Jim, then Hud.

696
00:45:33,836 --> 00:45:35,167
He figures he get Erickson alone,

697
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:36,173
then he'll come back for us.

698
00:45:38,310 --> 00:45:41,750
- Steve, let's get out of
here, let's go right now.

699
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,200
Please Steve, please, let's go.

700
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,623
- Honey, we'd never make it
down off that mountain alone.

701
00:45:47,856 --> 00:45:50,388
I don't know what Varga's up
to, but I'm going to find out.

702
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:52,443
- I can't stay here alone, I can't.

703
00:45:54,028 --> 00:45:55,595
- You're not going to
stay here in the tent,

704
00:45:55,595 --> 00:45:57,924
that would make it too easy for him.

705
00:45:57,924 --> 00:45:59,435
I think I can talk some
sense into Erickson

706
00:45:59,435 --> 00:46:00,785
when we're inside the cave.

707
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,490
Now, remember the last
place we stopped to rest

708
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,380
just before we got here?

709
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,213
That's where you're going

710
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:09,110
as soon as I pull out with Doc and Varga.

711
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:10,310
Stay there until I come.

712
00:46:11,388 --> 00:46:12,688
- But supposing you don't?

713
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,127
- I'll come back for you.

714
00:46:17,215 --> 00:46:19,884
Now, take all the food you can carry--

715
00:46:19,884 --> 00:46:21,116
- Steve,

716
00:46:21,116 --> 00:46:23,393
if he comes first, I'll jump.

717
00:46:25,095 --> 00:46:27,595
- You know, I think you would.

718
00:46:29,287 --> 00:46:31,098
(metal clinks)

719
00:46:31,098 --> 00:46:32,484
- Steve!

720
00:46:32,484 --> 00:46:34,120
Oh Steve!

721
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,953
- Coming Doc!

722
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,850
Try this, see if it's too heavy.

723
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:41,683
- I can handle it.

724
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:42,516
- All right, hide it.

725
00:46:42,516 --> 00:46:44,390
Soon as we're out of
sight, start back down.

726
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,026
Honey, don't lose it or we
don't eat all the way down.

727
00:46:47,026 --> 00:46:48,690
(Connie laughs)
I'll see the doctor.

728
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:52,423
- Oh good morning, Steve.

729
00:46:52,423 --> 00:46:55,040
- Morning, Varga, how are
things up in the hill?

730
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,770
- I kept watch all night,
not a sight of them.

731
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,820
- Eh, I guess we've seen the last of 'em.

732
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,410
Oh uh, Doc's been up all
night with his notes.

733
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,708
Maybe he'd like a rest before we start.

734
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:08,390
- Speak for yourself, Steve,
I'll be right with you.

735
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:10,270
- Is Miss Hayward coming with us?

736
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,260
- Oh she wanted to, but
I talked her out of it.

737
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,853
- I'm glad, she's had
enough trouble as it is.

738
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,903
By the way, I did find this.

739
00:47:22,258 --> 00:47:23,550
- Thanks.

740
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,039
I just hope I don't have to use it.

741
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,206
I'll be ready.

742
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:34,381
(gentle, dramatic music)
(hissing wind)

743
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,130
- I don't know how you do it, Varga,

744
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:17,570
these climbs never seem to bother you.

745
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:19,640
- I've spent most of my life climbing,

746
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,643
comes as naturally to me as
sitting at a desk does to you.

747
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:28,370
- Seems unreasonable to be
warm in temperature like this.

748
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:31,750
- I can remember really
being warm in Calcutta.

749
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:34,008
That heat was just too much for me.

750
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:37,000
- What does a Himalayan
guide do in Calcutta?

751
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,580
- Good question, my
father was stationed there

752
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,303
so I started my early schooling.

753
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,400
It didn't work out, so
he shipped me to Sweden

754
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,190
where the temperature
was more to my liking.

755
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,150
- Didn't the heat affect your father?

756
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,730
- Not as it did me.

757
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,450
Apparently I take after my mother,

758
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,213
she was a mountain
woman with Mongol blood.

759
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,260
I never knew her, she died at my birth.

760
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:00,080
- [Doctor] Are you married, Varga?

761
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,800
- Never had the time for it.

762
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,653
- Too bad.

763
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,990
Good blood strain like
yours should be perpetuated.

764
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:10,603
It makes for strong men and women too.

765
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:15,240
Well the right woman will come along.

766
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,460
- I'll name my first son Eric, Eric Varga.

767
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:20,880
Sounds good, doesn't it?

768
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,540
- I'll hold you to that promise.

769
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,563
Shall we move on?

770
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,040
- It was a light snow we had last night,

771
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,700
could move easily.

772
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,786
We'd better spread out just in case.

773
00:49:32,786 --> 00:49:35,140
(Doctor grunts)

774
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,140
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

775
00:50:07,289 --> 00:50:12,289
(dramatic, foreboding music)
(hissing wind)

776
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,587
(Steve exhales)

777
00:50:39,961 --> 00:50:44,961
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(rumbling rocks)

778
00:51:15,299 --> 00:51:18,397
- Come on, we've got to get to Steve.

779
00:51:18,397 --> 00:51:19,510
- He's no use to us, Doctor,

780
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:22,020
no man could live
underneath that avalanche.

781
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,410
- I'm going to take a look.

782
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:24,713
- You're coming with me!

783
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,740
- Varga, you'll do as I
ordered, this is my expedition.

784
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,220
- Was your expedition, Doctor,

785
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,900
you'll take orders from me now.

786
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,320
- Varga, you're forgetting your position.

787
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,340
- Don't ever talk to me like that again!

788
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,473
Don't even think it.

789
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,310
Start up that hill.

790
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,760
- You're mad, Varga.

791
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,740
- You'll soon see how mad.

792
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,447
Now start up that hill.

793
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:54,773
(dramatic, orchestral music)
(hissing wind)

794
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:12,333
My people will.

795
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:16,230
Most of them are not developed
intellectually, it's true.

796
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,743
They frighten at the sound of a shot,

797
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:21,770
but they'll get over that.

798
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:24,840
The only reason they wouldn't
kill one of you on sight

799
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,680
would be because I told them not to.

800
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,513
- You're mad.

801
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:35,107
- No Doctor, every move I've
made I've planned meticulously.

802
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,194
- I can make you the
most famous man alive.

803
00:52:40,194 --> 00:52:44,113
- (chuckles) Put me on
exhibition, no thank you, Doctor.

804
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,713
I have other plans for me and for you.

805
00:52:50,145 --> 00:52:52,345
- What possible plans
could you have for me?

806
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,003
- I plan to kill you.

807
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:58,780
- Kill me?

808
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,933
What good will that do?

809
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:02,653
- Kept this secret for centuries,

810
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,200
no man has ever seen us and lived.

811
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,163
No man will until we are ready.

812
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:11,610
Knowing what it would mean to you

813
00:53:11,610 --> 00:53:14,820
to find this out about us before you died.

814
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,670
I thought I'd give you this pleasure.

815
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:21,613
You see, we are quite human after all.

816
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:25,163
- Let me help you, Varga.

817
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,610
- I'm not ready for your kind of help.

818
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:31,920
- It's obvious to me what your plan is,

819
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,833
to breed out the Yeti strain,

820
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:36,590
but how can you do it without help?

821
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,200
- I, being the 5th generation,

822
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,130
you can see that it's not too difficult

823
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:45,850
to obtain the necessary females.

824
00:53:45,850 --> 00:53:48,260
- You kidnap women?

825
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,153
- There have been five this year.

826
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,677
Now, of course, there's--

827
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,200
- Connie!

828
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:58,613
- With her, I should be able
to hedgehop two generations.

829
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,983
Our offspring should be most interesting.

830
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:04,520
Don't you think so, Doctor?

831
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,790
Come come, Doctor,

832
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,363
a short while ago you were
recommending marriage for me.

833
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:17,390
Have you changed your mind so quickly?

834
00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:20,533
- I recommended marriage,
not what you have in mind.

835
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,913
I had great respect for you
a short time ago, Varga,

836
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:28,730
because I thought you were a man apart.

837
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,410
I was mistaken.

838
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:34,320
You're a devil, Varga, a devil incarnate.

839
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:37,530
- Doctor, you disappoint me.

840
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:42,530
I thought we could discuss this
dispassionately, clinically.

841
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,403
After all, it's your own field,

842
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,310
where man came from, where he's going.

843
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,600
I'd hoped to get some suggestions from you

844
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,043
on how we could develop
our intellectual side.

845
00:54:56,086 --> 00:54:57,332
You have nothing to offer?

846
00:54:57,332 --> 00:54:58,165
- No.

847
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:01,923
- Too bad.

848
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,223
We'll part sooner than I'd expected.

849
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:08,683
- You don't frighten me, Varga.

850
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,193
My life has been full.

851
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,633
- Well said, Doctor.

852
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:18,993
I do this with regret, for
I have enjoyed your visit.

853
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,263
We speak the same
language in many respects.

854
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,033
Goodbye Doctor.

855
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,023
Perhaps we'll meet again
in some other incarnation.

856
00:55:34,322 --> 00:55:38,352
(dramatic, percussion music)

857
00:55:38,352 --> 00:55:41,171
(gun blasts)

858
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:46,171
(wind hissing)
(dramatic, orchestral music)

859
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:17,690
Miss Hayward, Doctor Erickson
has been seriously hurt,

860
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:19,060
he wants to see you right away.

861
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:19,893
- Where's Steve?

862
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:21,100
- We were caught in a
slide, I saved the doctor,

863
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,030
but I'm afraid that--

864
00:56:22,030 --> 00:56:23,280
- No no, oh!

865
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,150
- Miss Hayward, you
don't have to be afraid,

866
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:26,493
I'm here to help you.

867
00:56:27,370 --> 00:56:28,989
- [Connie] Steve!

868
00:56:28,989 --> 00:56:32,155
Oh, Steve!

869
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:32,988
Steve!

870
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:36,366
Oh Steve!

871
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:43,614
(dramatic, foreboding music)

872
00:56:44,844 --> 00:56:47,440
(gun blasting)

873
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:51,190
(dramatic, foreboding music)

874
00:57:05,147 --> 00:57:10,147
(fists thumping)
(dramatic, foreboding music)

875
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,010
- Hurry, let's start down
while we have the chance.

876
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,320
- Steve, Varga killed
Jim and Doctor Erickson.

877
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,445
He told me when I wouldn't go with him.

878
00:57:42,445 --> 00:57:44,087
I think it's the madness
to the Yeti, I saw it.

879
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:46,687
- I know it all figures,
come on, we can talk later.

880
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:52,795
(dramatic, orchestral music)
