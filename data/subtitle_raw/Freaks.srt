1
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,454
Chloe! Hey!

2
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:21,831
What are you doing?

3
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,499
Someone could have seen you!

4
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,335
You've got to be a good
hider otherwise

5
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,212
the bad guys will find you.

6
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,505
Sorry, Dad.

7
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:43,185
I'm Eleanor Reed.
Age 7.

8
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:48,149
I live at 726 Monroe Street.

9
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,401
My birthday...

10
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:52,862
Mhm...

11
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:54,655
Is March 9th

12
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:56,407
10th.

13
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,284
March 10th.

14
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,744
Can I stir?

15
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,330
Yeah, but keep practicing.

16
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:08,044
That's my Mom, Nancy Reed.
Her birthday is August 10th.

17
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,715
Is she really going to love me?

18
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,593
That's why we're paying her.

19
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,929
That's my sister Harper.

20
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,722
Harper.

21
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,557
Her birthday's June 13th.

22
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,851
She snores.

23
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,687
Where'd you get that?

24
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:30,650
I thought we were
going with puppies.

25
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,568
It's true Dad.

26
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,320
She snores.

27
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,823
Good job, Chloe.

28
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,034
That is something a
sister would say.

29
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,410
Partners?

30
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,912
Partners.

31
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,935
What's the plan if
I don't come back?

32
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,895
I go to my closet.

33
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,605
Yeah?

34
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,815
And then what?

35
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:13,943
If I run out of food I
go across the street,

36
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:17,238
tell Steve and Nancy that I'm
Eleanor Reed and I give them

37
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,281
the whole shebang if
they take care of me.

38
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,376
Let's go over the old
classics, shall we? A.

39
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,420
A is for Apple.

40
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:36,590
Apple is a red fruit that
you eat and it is delicious.

41
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:37,842
You ever seen a green one?

42
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,552
- Yes.
- Okay, good.

43
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:40,928
What's B?

44
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,471
B is for baseball.

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,141
A game played between
two teams with 9 players

46
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,810
who run in circles around
a diamond-shaped field.

47
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:49,478
Chloe what's your
favourite sport?

48
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,522
I've never played a sport.

49
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:52,523
Bang!

50
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,024
You're dead.

51
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,109
That's not fair!

52
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,777
You never asked me that before.

53
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,030
If you don't know the answer to
something you just make it up.

54
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,073
You go...

55
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:01,949
huh?

56
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,825
I don't know!

57
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,410
I love all sports.

58
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,328
That's lying.

59
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:07,538
Yes.

60
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:10,040
You need to lie to be normal.

61
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,672
How much money do you
think is right there?

62
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:23,053
Well these are hundred dollar
bills so like a couple thousand?

63
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,847
More than that.

64
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,100
No, I'm not sure myself.

65
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,814
Okay I raise ten.

66
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,526
Can we have ice cream
after dinner?

67
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,196
You know we don't
have any ice cream.

68
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:43,991
When are you going?

69
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,202
Not for a while.

70
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,245
I was hitting the store
too much.

71
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,334
I can't wait until I'm normal.

72
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,128
Are you going to call
my ten or not?

73
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,259
You're bluffing.

74
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,261
Try me.

75
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,682
All in.

76
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,109
I missed the river.

77
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,194
You win.

78
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,071
You're getting good
under pressure.

79
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,239
Staying calm.

80
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,865
That's good.

81
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,299
Did Mom's eyes bleed too?

82
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,180
Are my eyes going
to bleed someday?

83
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,432
I hope not.

84
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:54,270
But if they do you're going
to let me know, right?

85
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,230
Right.

86
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,607
You're going to say, 'hey Dad
my eyes are bleeding,

87
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,775
what the heck?'

88
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,694
Yeah

89
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:06,699
Alright now collect your
million dollar jackpot

90
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,908
Alright

91
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,580
Make sure you get
the ones in the back.

92
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,414
I did!

93
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,875
Oh well, last time I checked...

94
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:22,047
Oof, there are knots
in your hair.

95
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,424
Ow!

96
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,508
Alright.

97
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,634
Time for breathing.

98
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,763
Alright.

99
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:35,895
Close your eyes,
nice deep breaths.

100
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,439
In.

101
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,690
Exhale.

102
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,901
In.

103
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,331
You're not normal!

104
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,294
It's not funny.

105
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,670
It's not funny, Chloe.

106
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,922
You need to practice this.

107
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,214
You looked funny.

108
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,259
You gotta practice this.

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,427
It's important.

110
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,638
And if I don't I'll
go to the mountain?

111
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,726
What are you talking about?

112
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,021
Nothing.

113
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,941
I never taught you
about the mountain

114
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,401
so you must have talked
to someone.

115
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,570
Did you go outside?

116
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,613
No

117
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,950
Did you go through Daddy's
junk mail?

118
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,711
Is that where you learned about
the mountain?

119
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,245
No.

120
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,914
Chloe, Chloe, Chloe.

121
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:40,167
This is not a game
right now okay?

122
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,336
You can never lie to me.

123
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,589
I'm not lying.

124
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,963
You're never mean to me, Mommy.

125
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:20,035
Go away ghost.
Go away ghost.

126
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,039
Go away.

127
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,333
Go away ghost.

128
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,226
You imagined it.

129
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,688
Ghosts aren't real.

130
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:52,401
Stay with me.
I'm scared.

131
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:01,785
Okay but I can't fall
asleep again.

132
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:05,247
Too much time goes by outside
when I'm asleep.

133
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:10,669
I can only protect you
when I'm awake.

134
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:42,344
Mr. Snowcone.

135
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,471
Whoa.

136
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,644
Harper. Bring me ice cream.

137
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,021
Please.

138
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,689
Bring me ice cream.

139
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,568
Please, please, please,
please, please.

140
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:45,198
Bring me ice cream.
Bring me ice cream.

141
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,702
Harper.

142
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:08,972
Hello?

143
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,850
Hi.

144
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,394
I brought you ice cream.

145
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,938
Is it chocolate?

146
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:18,982
Yes.

147
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,057
Hey!

148
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,685
What are you doing here?
Huh?

149
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,189
I brought Chloe some ice cream.

150
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,777
How do you know her name?
How do you know her name?

151
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,823
Huh? Huh?

152
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,492
Harper?

153
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,411
What are you doing here?

154
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:15,372
You know better than to knock
on strangers' doors.

155
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,583
I am sorry about that.

156
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,877
I don't know why she came
over here.

157
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,337
No, not at all. Not at all.

158
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,922
Alright. Bye-bye now.

159
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,717
Is this your daughter?

160
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,012
Oh we should go.

161
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,222
Gotta go.

162
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:33,932
Hi.

163
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,101
Hi I'm Nancy.

164
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,311
You're beautiful.

165
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,898
Oh my goodness
she's a sweetheart.

166
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,608
And she looks so normal.

167
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,986
Eleanor, go back inside.

168
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,365
Come on Eleanor, go back inside.

169
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,709
Harper called you Chloe.

170
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,253
Was that Nancy, for real?

171
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,755
How did she know your real name?

172
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:17,470
Have you been going outside?

173
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,025
No.

174
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,491
No, Dad! The closet
is too scary!

175
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,576
You know the punishment
for breaking the rules.

176
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:35,243
Time out.

177
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,411
I almost got ice cream.

178
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,913
You opened the door.

179
00:16:38,206 --> 00:16:39,748
You almost got us killed.

180
00:16:59,894 --> 00:17:02,187
Vroom, vroom. Vroom, vroom!

181
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,023
I'm an ice cream truck and
I give kids ice cream

182
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,650
all around the world.

183
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:10,529
Vroom, vroom.

184
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,238
Oh no!

185
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,447
There's a giant!

186
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,907
There's Harper.

187
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:15,742
She likes chocolate ice cream.

188
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,209
What are you doing
in my room, Chloe?

189
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,461
Shh you can't call me that.

190
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,421
I'm supposed to be Eleanor.

191
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,969
Will you play a game with
me before Dad wakes up?

192
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,013
You are so annoying.

193
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,642
Why do you always wake me up
in the middle of the night?

194
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:43,770
We can play at the park
like normal people.

195
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,691
You're allowed to play outside
with other kids?

196
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,735
Aren't you scared the bad guys
will want to kill you?

197
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,445
No.

198
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:54,239
Everybody does it.

199
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,240
It's fine.

200
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,620
It's not fair that you have
a Mom and I don't.

201
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,249
Will you pretend to be my Mom?

202
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,792
Ew.

203
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,252
Why are you so weird?

204
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,253
That's gross.

205
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,714
Come on.

206
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,007
No.

207
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:19,592
Be my Mom. Be my Mom.
Be my Mom.

208
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,725
Be my Mom. Be my Mom.

209
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:27,147
Okay fine. I'll be your Mom.

210
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:30,734
Say you love me.

211
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:33,236
I love you.

212
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:36,948
Mom.

213
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,283
I want to go outside.

214
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,909
Am I allowed?

215
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:41,953
Yes you can go outside.

216
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:43,538
Thanks Mom.

217
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,958
Now let's cuddle and sleep.

218
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,267
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

219
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,103
Mom said I could go outside.

220
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,396
Chloe.

221
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,649
She said I could go
to the ice cream truck.

222
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,984
Want to know what's
in an ice cream truck?

223
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,985
What?

224
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,612
Frozen kid bodies.

225
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:16,738
Not true.

226
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,824
They kill kids and then
they freeze them to eat later.

227
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,743
I want to go anyway.

228
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:25,580
You're not normal enough yet.

229
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,457
You'll die if you go outside.

230
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,209
It's not fair.

231
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,836
Harper gets to go to
the park and I don't.

232
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:37,550
If I get you ice cream will you
shut up about this?

233
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:39,344
Yes.

234
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:42,389
I'll get you a whole bucket

235
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,392
if you never open that
door ever again.

236
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,143
I promise.

237
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,437
Will you get it for me today?

238
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,485
Fine. I need new
supplies anyway.

239
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,528
Yay!

240
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,113
Thank you Daddy!

241
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:20,677
Hide!

242
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:21,845
They might have followed me.

243
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,225
Daddy are you okay?

244
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,893
It's okay.

245
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,562
Most of this is their blood.

246
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,563
Whose blood?

247
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,482
What happened?

248
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:43,158
Don't worry.

249
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,909
I'll be alright.

250
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,580
Just gotta be more careful.

251
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:52,584
I can't be leaving the house
for stupid, non-essential-

252
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,908
You forgot the ice cream.

253
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:30,413
What? Don't you realize
I almost just died?

254
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,373
I'm going to the grocery myself.

255
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,750
Chloe.

256
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,586
You see what happens
when we go outside?

257
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,012
When am I going to live
with Nancy?

258
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:52,143
Change of plan.

259
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,728
What?

260
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,021
Yeah.

261
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,025
We have to stay hidden.

262
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,486
Till when?

263
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,699
Till when?!

264
00:24:41,772 --> 00:24:43,481
Well lookie here!

265
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,985
What can I do for you,
young woman?

266
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,781
Are we safe?

267
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,700
Safe?

268
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,535
Safe from what?

269
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,704
The people who want to kill us.

270
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,790
Nobody's going to kill you
if I'm around.

271
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,419
Can I have ice cream?

272
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:05,670
Sure!

273
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,505
But what flavour, Chloe?

274
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:08,798
Chocolate.

275
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,717
Wow, a hundred bucks.

276
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,137
You can buy a shitload of
ice cream for a hundred bucks.

277
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:15,888
Is that a lot?

278
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,056
What do you mean is it a lot?

279
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,350
You could buy any flavour
you wanted with that.

280
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,101
Really?

281
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,310
Yeah.

282
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:24,188
Come around back.
Come inside.

283
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:26,357
Taste any flavour you want.

284
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,986
I'm not allowed.

285
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,155
Oh, come on.

286
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,073
Hey.

287
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:38,036
You never have to do what
your Dad tells you again.

288
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,584
Come on up.

289
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,461
Take a look around.

290
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,466
Are there frozen kid bodies
in there?

291
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,509
It's an ice cream truck.

292
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,094
Come on. I gotta go.

293
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,181
There's other kids that have
to have ice cream too, you know!

294
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:01,768
But I'd love to have a big
girl like you helping me out.

295
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,479
You could actually make
some of the ice cream.

296
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,355
Here.

297
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:08,566
Lookie here.

298
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,568
Are you going to the park?

299
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,363
That's exactly where I'm going!

300
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:15,782
So come on.

301
00:27:00,202 --> 00:27:02,286
Is that a bad guy or a good guy?

302
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,163
What do you think?

303
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,916
He bleeds like my Dad.

304
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:09,377
Well no, they just put that
on him.

305
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,086
That's like makeup.

306
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:13,214
That's just because they want to
scare the hell out of everybody.

307
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,176
You ever bleed from your eye
like that?

308
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,011
No.

309
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,765
You're not lying to me, are you?

310
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:26,936
That's too bad.

311
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,646
Woo!

312
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,939
Push me!

313
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,526
So Chloe, can you
do anything special?

314
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,527
Higher!

315
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,529
How about when you're scared?

316
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,615
Anything weird ever happen?

317
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,617
Even!

318
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,868
Higher!

319
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,995
I want to touch the sky.

320
00:28:25,996 --> 00:28:28,623
I want to touch outside
of the universe!

321
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,582
Okay real high!

322
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,460
Okay out of the universe
here you go!

323
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,795
Maybe you can fly!

324
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,005
Go higher!

325
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:37,882
Wait no! Stop pushing!

326
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:38,466
Higher!

327
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,176
Stop! That's too high!

328
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:40,801
Now jump!

329
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,761
I'm scared!

330
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:42,345
Jump!

331
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,179
Stop!

332
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,930
Jump!

333
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:45,139
Let me go!

334
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,390
Have some courage.

335
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,725
Come on Chloe.

336
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,768
Jump out of the swing!

337
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:49,769
I'm scared!

338
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,479
Come on, jump out!

339
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,772
Come on!

340
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,440
Show some courage!

341
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:55,900
I'm scared.

342
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,527
What do you mean
you're scared? It's okay.

343
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:01,530
Don't you under-
Come here. It's okay.

344
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:02,823
Ow!

345
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,741
What's the matter?

346
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,659
Does that hurt?

347
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,284
Yes!

348
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,369
Does it make you mad?

349
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,328
Yes!

350
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,039
Now what happens when
you really get mad?

351
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,668
I take deep breaths
to calm down.

352
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,966
Is there anything that you can
do that other people can't do?

353
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,219
Well I've never met
any other people.

354
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,722
Well, you know what's happening?

355
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:29,892
Your Dad is turning you
into a pussy.

356
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,310
You can't do that.

357
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,313
You gotta be strong
like your Mom was.

358
00:29:34,648 --> 00:29:35,690
You knew my Mom?

359
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:37,275
Everybody knew your Mom.

360
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,610
Your Mom was famous.

361
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,695
What's famous?

362
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:46,158
Famous means she had
special gifts just like you.

363
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:51,122
And everybody who knew her
was scared to death of her,

364
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:53,291
except the people who loved her.

365
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,168
And then she died?

366
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:02,300
You may not know this but
in a land far away from here

367
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,719
there is big evil dark mountain.

368
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,845
I've heard of the mountain.

369
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,389
Yeah, well your Mom and
I went to that mountain

370
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,767
together, and we tried to
destroy it, and just as we...

371
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,476
Hey.

372
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,853
What's going on here?

373
00:30:14,563 --> 00:30:15,771
Everything okay little girl?

374
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,066
It's okay bud.

375
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:21,360
Actually we're getting ready
to leave.

376
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:23,112
Come on.

377
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,405
I want to go home.

378
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,157
Do you know this man?

379
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:27,199
No.

380
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,659
She's my granddaughter.

381
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,328
Is this your grandpa?

382
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,329
No.

383
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:33,539
She jokes like that
all the time.

384
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,415
Shut up for a sec.

385
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,499
Let me see your eyes.

386
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,542
Why?

387
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,209
You know why.

388
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,461
Oh my God.

389
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:39,295
Who is that?

390
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:40,504
He's a bad man.

391
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:41,964
He's going to kill us.

392
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,674
Hey I'm not done talking to you.

393
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,467
Yeah.

394
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:45,885
No, it's cool bud.

395
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:47,428
You know the people that want
to kill us?

396
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,429
That's him.

397
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,513
That's him!

398
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,639
- Shut up!
- No!

399
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:51,432
Don't kill us!

400
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,516
I'm not going to hurt you,
sweetheart.

401
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,059
Just come here.

402
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,102
You don't need to point
the gun at us!

403
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:55,853
We're leaving.

404
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:56,854
Hey!

405
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:57,605
He killed your mother!

406
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,731
Step away from the girl!

407
00:30:58,732 --> 00:30:59,732
Make him go away.

408
00:30:59,733 --> 00:31:00,399
I said shut up.

409
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Get rid of him!

410
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:01,984
Now!

411
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,610
Go away!

412
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:03,694
Let me see your eyes, old man.

413
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,695
Go away!

414
00:31:04,738 --> 00:31:05,946
Look I said come here now, kid!

415
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,614
Go away!

416
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,908
Go away! Go away!
Go away! Go away!

417
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,432
You are a very special girl
and you and I

418
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,893
are going to do big things
together.

419
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,937
Now let's go home.

420
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Come on.

421
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,369
All officers on alert.

422
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,080
Abnormal child reported
at Peachtree Park.

423
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,331
ADF has been notified.

424
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,583
Repeat. All officers on alert.

425
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,754
You did good.

426
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,548
Very good.

427
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,341
Who is that?

428
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:15,182
That's your Mommy.
My daughter.

429
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,979
She looks like an angel.

430
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,189
Yeah she sure does.

431
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,899
Just like you.

432
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,863
I have a dream to get her back.

433
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:31,991
I'm going to get her back.

434
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,743
But she's dead.

435
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:41,208
Well, sometimes angels can come
back to Earth.

436
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,921
Can I have it?

437
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,090
No.

438
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:52,720
It's the only picture I have
of her and I'd like to keep it

439
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:54,722
so I can look at her every day.

440
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,398
Oh come on don't give me
those eyes.

441
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,358
Here, take it back.

442
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,651
It's a rental.

443
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:11,322
Just don't get boogers and all
that crap out of your nose

444
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,865
and stuff on it, okay?

445
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,325
Okay.

446
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,717
When am I going
to see you again?

447
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,719
When the time is right.

448
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,181
You see, your Dad
has to be asleep.

449
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,310
So I have a present for you.

450
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,525
When you hear the music
from my truck,

451
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:51,195
you put this in Dad's food
and he'll go out.

452
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,822
Like magic?

453
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,199
That's exactly right.

454
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,325
That's what it is.

455
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:57,743
It is magic.

456
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:58,744
Take it.

457
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,830
And you know what else?

458
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:07,086
You, madam, are not going
to have to hide much longer.

459
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,893
Chloe?

460
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,149
Chloe? Chloe!

461
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,609
Chloe!

462
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,862
There you are.

463
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,325
Did you hear me calling you?
Huh?

464
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:39,827
You scared me.

465
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,213
I'm sorry I didn't get you
any ice cream.

466
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,592
I'll go out and I'll get you
some tomorrow.

467
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,552
I don't care about ice cream.

468
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,556
Can I colour too?

469
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:04,727
No.

470
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,772
You're a liar.

471
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,818
What?

472
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,071
You lied about the bad people.

473
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,948
They won't hurt me.

474
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,619
What are you talking about?

475
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,495
I'm going to go live with Nancy.

476
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:24,997
Wait Chloe.

477
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,290
I want a Mom!

478
00:35:26,374 --> 00:35:27,499
You had a Mom.

479
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,295
You are not going
to be like her.

480
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,796
She died because
she broke the rules.

481
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,131
She didn't break the rules.

482
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,382
She was special.

483
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,508
And I'm special.

484
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:39,219
Don't say that again, okay?

485
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,805
I'm special. I'm special!

486
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,015
I'm special!

487
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:44,975
I'm special I can feel it!

488
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,560
You're not special!

489
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,021
Don't say that again okay?

490
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,106
I hate you.

491
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,318
You're not my Dad anymore.

492
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,112
Baby I'm sorry.

493
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,114
I'm just trying to protect you.

494
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,532
You're a liar.

495
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:01,909
I'm not lying to you.

496
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:02,951
I'm so sorry.

497
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,536
Get out of my room!

498
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,374
Get out!

499
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,003
Get out! Get out of my room!

500
00:36:16,466 --> 00:36:17,966
I hate you!

501
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,761
I wish I had a Mom.

502
00:36:32,065 --> 00:36:33,732
You're so beautiful.

503
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,199
Hello?

504
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,829
Ghost?

505
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,666
Who are you?

506
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,753
Chloe.

507
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,213
Chloe?

508
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:40,382
No.

509
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,426
What are they giving me?

510
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,724
You're really my Mom?

511
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,980
Chloe.

512
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,195
Chloe. Chloe.

513
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:05,783
No.

514
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,159
You're not real.

515
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,496
You sick assholes!

516
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,540
Get this kid out of here before
I rip her throat out!

517
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:15,250
I'll kill you all!

518
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:41,819
Dad?

519
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:19,106
And that's why you came
to town today,

520
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,983
because of reports of
a full-blooded minor.

521
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,025
Is that correct?

522
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,111
Yes, there was an interesting
report.

523
00:39:24,112 --> 00:39:27,656
As you know, Abnormal minors are
my particular area of interest.

524
00:39:27,657 --> 00:39:31,285
I can't help but notice you use
the term 'Abnormal'

525
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:34,079
as opposed to the more
widely-used 'Freaks' -

526
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,540
is that a political statement?

527
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,501
I believe it's important for
the ADF to try to normalize

528
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,920
relations with the
Abnormal community.

529
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,755
Abnormal community?

530
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:48,510
By definition, any Freaks who
are running loose are illegal.

531
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,970
Declaring a group
of people illegal

532
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,179
doesn't make them go away.

533
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,598
It makes them go underground.

534
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,933
They're forced to defend
themselves to survive.

535
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,104
Well to your point, the Amnesty
Act gave Freaks

536
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,107
an opportunity to peacefully
relocate to Madoc Mountain.

537
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:04,735
So, the ones who continue
to hide in our cities,

538
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:06,069
they're breaking the law,
are they not?

539
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,739
I believe in relocation
and termination.

540
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,575
Abnormals are dangerous and
we can't let them live free.

541
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,702
But I don't believe they are
born evil.

542
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,746
Everyone knows
their abilities increase

543
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,997
generation by generation.

544
00:40:16,998 --> 00:40:18,290
Their children are defined

545
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,918
as living weapons
of mass destruction.

546
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,962
Isn't culling them as children
the most humane approach?

547
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,504
But I just

548
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,548
I mean the last time Freak
children were loose,

549
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,424
we lost Dallas.

550
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,010
Just imagine if we could raise

551
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,929
an abnormal child ourselves.

552
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,223
Teach him or her how to be good.

553
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:35,933
With guidance,

554
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:41,480
a child like that would be a
powerful tool in our arsenal.

555
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,569
I can't wait to live
with you Harper.

556
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:50,113
And have a normal family.

557
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,699
We're really going
to be sisters.

558
00:40:53,326 --> 00:40:55,410
Your Mom is going to love me.

559
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:43,000
Harper?

560
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:45,627
What are you doing here?

561
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,505
This is my room.

562
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,840
No it's my room.

563
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,425
Who the hell let you in here?

564
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,719
I'm going to live with you now.

565
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:55,554
Who in the world is this?

566
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,764
She's a weirdo who lives across
the street.

567
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:59,349
I'm not a weirdo.

568
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,892
I know how to be normal.

569
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,270
Are you friends with a Freak?

570
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:04,604
She's not my friend.

571
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,856
I'm not a freak.

572
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:09,776
She's just messed up in the head
because she doesn't have a Mom.

573
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,490
She's such a freak.

574
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:20,871
Freak! Freak!

575
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:21,371
Freak!

576
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,456
I'm not a freak!

577
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,498
Freak! Freak!

578
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,958
And I do have a Mom!

579
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,251
And she's a ghost
and she's famous

580
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:27,919
and she lives in my closet!

581
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,421
Freak! Freak! Freak!

582
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,422
See!

583
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:46,438
Mommy don't be scared.
It's alright.

584
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,023
The girls aren't here anymore.

585
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,733
Go away. You're not real.

586
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:50,859
You're not real.

587
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,071
It's okay Mommy.

588
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,906
Don't be scared.

589
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:16,843
Oh my God.

590
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:19,346
I missed you.

591
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:22,682
You're alive.

592
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,353
I thought you were dead.

593
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,939
I'm not dead Mommy.

594
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,565
You are.

595
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,821
How long have I been gone?

596
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:37,906
It's only been a few months

597
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:41,535
and you were a baby
and now you're...

598
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,079
how did you get so big?

599
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:51,169
Chloe how did you get in here?

600
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,964
I opened the door.

601
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,933
Chloe where are you?

602
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,727
In my closet.

603
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,023
Is your Dad there?

604
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,733
Where is he?

605
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,277
He's sleeping.

606
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:16,695
He's always tired.

607
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,242
Why do you live in my closet?

608
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,415
I don't, Chloe.

609
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,919
I want to be with you
all the time.

610
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,720
Oh I wouldn't want you
to be here with me.

611
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,517
Because you're dead.

612
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,477
I'm ready for my new mom.

613
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,355
But Dad says I can't have her.

614
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,236
Your new mom?

615
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,946
Nancy.

616
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:02,991
She lives across the
street and she makes cookies.

617
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:14,377
You tell your Dad,

618
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:21,176
you tell your Dad that he should
move on, okay?

619
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,013
And baby I'm so sorry that

620
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,848
I can't be there with you.

621
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:32,854
But I'm not going
to be coming back, okay?

622
00:45:33,898 --> 00:45:35,857
And you should have a new mom.

623
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,152
You should have a new mom, okay?

624
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:43,782
We're coming for you soon bitch!

625
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,810
What are you doing down here?

626
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:12,978
I saw Mom.

627
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:15,313
She lives in my closet.

628
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,357
This is my alone time.

629
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,858
She said I should get a new mom.

630
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,235
She said you should move on.

631
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,112
Stop making stuff up.

632
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,240
I'm going to live with Nancy.

633
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:26,783
I can be normal.

634
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30,870
Stop! Chloe!

635
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,622
What's gotten into you?

636
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:41,673
I wish you would die.

637
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,399
Someday they will kill me.

638
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:08,074
You'll be on your own and
you'll regret saying that.

639
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,049
I'm sorry Daddy.

640
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,598
I made you special juice.

641
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,393
Thanks.

642
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:19,145
I'm sorry too.

643
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:22,273
Partners?

644
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,490
What's this?

645
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,870
Are you trying to poison me?

646
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,551
Chloe! Chloe!

647
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,263
Chloe!

648
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,727
What the hell is this?

649
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,688
Where the hell did you get this?

650
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,273
After everything
I've done for you?

651
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,023
Stop yelling!

652
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,192
- Go to sleep! Go to sleep!
- How could you do this to me Chloe?

653
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,527
What are you thinking?

654
00:49:07,528 --> 00:49:10,071
I'm the only person
keeping you alive, Chloe!

655
00:49:10,114 --> 00:49:11,698
- Go to sleep! Go to sleep!
- Why'd you do this?!

656
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,159
- Go to sleep! Go to sleep!
- Chloe! Why did you do this?

657
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,877
Whoa. Where are you going?

658
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,421
Oh my God.

659
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:15,762
Here. Whenever you feel you cry
you must wipe away that tear.

660
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,096
It's a dead giveaway.

661
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:19,641
Okay? What's that?

662
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,018
To get my new mom.

663
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,270
Your new mom?

664
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:27,398
What are you talking about,
your new mom?

665
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,650
Nancy Reed.

666
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,360
Oh come on.

667
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,654
I got a better idea than that.

668
00:50:32,655 --> 00:50:33,655
What?

669
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,907
Real mom.

670
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,075
Get in the truck.

671
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,744
Now!

672
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:57,595
It's getting close.

673
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,264
Should be here in a few minutes.

674
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,558
Now... showtime.

675
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,601
I don't want to be here.

676
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:08,856
When we go inside you
don't say anything.

677
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:10,275
Why?

678
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,943
Just don't open your mouth.

679
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,571
You're scaring me.

680
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:23,454
Did your Dad ever tell you
the story of the unicorns?

681
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:30,336
Well, in a forest very
nearby there was

682
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,339
a whole big family of unicorns.

683
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:39,053
Then one night a pack of
snarling wolves came

684
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:42,515
into the forest and grabbed
the Mommy unicorn

685
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,726
and took her away.

686
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:49,147
And the Daddy unicorn who had
a weapon right here

687
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:50,732
chose not to use it.

688
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,442
He wanted to hide.

689
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:55,486
He wanted to be a peaceful
unicorn.

690
00:51:56,363 --> 00:52:02,785
Well, the next night the wolves
came back

691
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,832
and they ate the Daddy unicorn.

692
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:10,627
Then what happened?

693
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:12,003
The baby?

694
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:14,047
She's left alone.

695
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,673
Doesn't know what to do.

696
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,011
She knows that she's supposed
to hide

697
00:52:20,012 --> 00:52:22,055
because that's what the Dad did.

698
00:52:23,015 --> 00:52:24,891
And so she thought if I do that

699
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:28,978
then I can live peacefully
in the forest.

700
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,482
But you know what happened?

701
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:39,030
There are no more
fucking unicorns.

702
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:44,494
Hiding is out.

703
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,724
That's her.

704
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:07,892
In the booth.

705
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:14,649
Excuse me, Agent Ray?

706
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:18,653
Uh, could I have a word
with you for a minute?

707
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,155
Sorry I don't have time
right now, Father.

708
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,657
I have something to tell you

709
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:26,619
and I need to tell it to you,
um, privately.

710
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,292
Watch the door.

711
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,087
May we?

712
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,088
Please.

713
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,219
My name is Father Tom Finnegan

714
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:47,056
and you and I share
a common dream.

715
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:48,766
What dream is that?

716
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,604
Well, this little soul here
needs your protection.

717
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:57,608
And we need you to take us
to Madoc Mountain.

718
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:06,200
Seven years ago a newborn was
laid on the steps of my church

719
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:10,997
with a note - a prayer -
to keep her safe.

720
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:17,462
I knew right then I might have
an Abnormal.

721
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,422
Why do you think that?

722
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,049
Well it was right
at the beginning

723
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,885
of the relocation riots.

724
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:24,802
You remember that.

725
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,305
They were rounding up
every Freak they could find.

726
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:32,769
I had suspicions but I raised
her all by myself.

727
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,354
Look at me.

728
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,450
Do you mind, Father?

729
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,160
Please.

730
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,046
You just admitted
to a federal crime.

731
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,548
I know what I did ma'am.

732
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,970
But I also know if I raised her
in the light of the Lord

733
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:13,726
and taught her to love that she
might never be a Freak at all.

734
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,269
I'm not a freak.

735
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,604
I'm normal.

736
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:22,610
Um, it's okay.
She's not going to hurt you.

737
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:23,861
You don't need to pretend.

738
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,363
I'm not pretending.

739
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,198
What's your name, sweetie?

740
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,991
I'm Eleanor Reed.

741
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,619
I'm seven and a half
and I like baseball.

742
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:33,412
My dad is Steven Reed.

743
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,122
He likes fishing but he's not
very good at it.

744
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:37,416
You can give it up.
You don't have to do it.

745
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:38,084
I just told ya.

746
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,294
I'm not gonna tell you two
or three times every time.

747
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,295
Her Dad?

748
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:45,550
She doesn't have any parents.
I raised her by myself.

749
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,134
I do so!

750
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,928
My mom is Nancy Reed.

751
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:50,096
Her birthday is August 10th.

752
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:51,222
Cut it out!

753
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:52,503
I'm going to have
to make a call.

754
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:56,060
But before you do,
there is one condition.

755
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,311
You have a condition.

756
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:02,275
Forgive me, but
I have to stay in her life.

757
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:05,403
So I can continue
to nurture her.

758
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:08,197
Therefore you gotta take
both of us to Madoc Mountain.

759
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,032
I'm not going anywhere with her.

760
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,450
I'm not a freak!

761
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:13,828
Hey! Come back here!

762
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,246
You scared her.

763
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,164
Not your fault.

764
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,294
Copy that. On our way.

765
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,631
Don't ever do that to me again.

766
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,300
Never wimp out on me.

767
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:28,426
Why are you doing this?

768
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:31,304
You have no idea how hard
it was for me to get

769
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:32,388
that bitch's schedule!

770
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,806
I'm not a freak!

771
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,308
I'm normal!

772
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,810
Oh no, no, it's cool.

773
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,020
I didn't hear anything.

774
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,271
Hey maybe you're a Freak,
maybe you're not a Freak.

775
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:41,063
I don't care.

776
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,148
That's not my business.

777
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,108
It's okay, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

778
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:46,235
What are you afraid of?

779
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,236
Nothing.

780
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:50,197
Um, could I borrow your pen?

781
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:53,367
Yes, of course.

782
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,368
Absolutely.

783
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,128
No! No!

784
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:10,593
His eye is bleeding!

785
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:11,594
- Fire!
- Stop!

786
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,138
That's not the guy!

787
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:18,225
Hold your fire!

788
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:21,938
We gotta disappear.

789
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,324
Goddamnit!

790
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:35,701
Shit!

791
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:37,662
Is that man going to be okay?

792
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:38,871
No he's dead!

793
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,999
That's what happens when they
find a special person like us.

794
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,667
You're dead!

795
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,668
Period.

796
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:47,129
You know they always fed us this
crap about Madoc Mountain

797
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,090
was gonna be a new home for us

798
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:51,425
and a place where we
could be independent.

799
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,594
It's a goddamn death trap.

800
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,054
Why did you want to live there?

801
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,847
We didn't want to live there.

802
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,726
We had to get inside it and
the only way to get inside was

803
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,229
to pretend we wanted
to go there.

804
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:07,400
I'll be goddamned if I'm gonna
let anybody including you

805
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:10,111
get in the way of me
saving my daughter.

806
00:58:10,821 --> 00:58:12,238
But she's dead.

807
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,490
I don't understand.

808
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,702
Well you don't really have
to understand.

809
00:58:17,703 --> 00:58:21,664
You're seven years old
for Christ's sake and you,

810
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:27,294
you have to allow me to teach
you to use your powers now!

811
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,587
I don't wanna!

812
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,215
I'm giving Nancy the whole
shebang to take care of me.

813
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,299
No you're not.

814
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,884
You're not giving
her that money.

815
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,803
We're going home
to my apartment.

816
00:58:36,972 --> 00:58:38,139
Take me home.

817
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:38,848
What?

818
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,643
Take me home!

819
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:49,894
TAKE ME HOME!

820
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:54,321
Get out of my goddamn head!

821
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:02,413
Take me back.

822
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:03,831
Now.

823
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:06,250
Alright I'll take you back.

824
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,669
Jesus Christ.

825
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:29,732
Goddamnit!

826
00:59:29,733 --> 00:59:31,567
Get out of the truck Chloe!

827
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:32,860
Stay there.

828
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,111
Don't you worry.

829
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,905
I'll take care of this.

830
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:39,700
Daddy!

831
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,951
Grandpa stabbed a guy!

832
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:42,495
And we also met a real bad guy!

833
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,096
- But she was a girl-
- Get in the house.

834
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:45,956
Looking good, Henry.

835
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,957
You're coming with me.

836
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,509
Chloe!

837
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:57,843
No Daddy!

838
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:58,803
I don't want to go back
to the house!

839
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,012
I looked everywhere for a week.

840
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:00,805
I want to go to Nancy's house!

841
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:02,098
I can't handle you anymore.

842
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,432
No Daddy let me go!

843
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,975
What do I have to do
to make you listen?

844
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:05,726
Let me go!

845
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:06,477
Let me down!

846
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:08,646
Let me go!

847
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,401
Chloe!

848
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:30,209
You're special too Daddy?

849
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,464
I tried so hard to protect you.

850
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:44,890
I created a time bubble around
our house to keep you safe.

851
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:50,146
It worked as long as I could
stay awake.

852
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:54,191
For the rest of the world it's
only been a couple of months

853
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,902
since they killed Mom
and we started hiding.

854
01:00:58,029 --> 01:01:03,993
But for us inside the
house you grew up years.

855
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,417
Everything is changing so fast.

856
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:16,755
I wish I could stop time
permanently

857
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:21,802
but I can't keep you in
the bubble forever.

858
01:01:26,308 --> 01:01:27,391
I'm ready.

859
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,547
What are you doing here?

860
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:00,257
Is everything okay?

861
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:02,509
This has to happen now Steve.

862
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,683
Um you know we're actually right
in the middle of dinner.

863
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:13,145
I brought dessert.

864
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,439
Okay.

865
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:17,650
Okay, yes.

866
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,859
Come on in. Come on in.

867
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:24,657
Honey we have guests.

868
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:29,995
Eleanor.

869
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,624
Mom why is she here?

870
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:36,126
I'm Eleanor Reed.

871
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:38,212
I'm seven and a half
and I like baseball.

872
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,214
Sweetie are you hungry?

873
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,548
Come on sit down.

874
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:42,633
I'll get you some food.

875
01:02:46,304 --> 01:02:48,013
Uh, okay.

876
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:49,932
Are you joining us too?

877
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:50,975
- No.
- No.

878
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,479
You were supposed to give us
more notice.

879
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,605
It's only been a month.

880
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,440
We haven't even told Harper yet.

881
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,651
After today you've never going
to see me again.

882
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:02,027
You'll get one of these
every month

883
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,988
as long as you don't call
the ADF.

884
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,531
Please take good care of her.

885
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:06,031
Okay.

886
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,241
I'm Eleanor.

887
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:11,453
My birthday is March 9th and
I live at 726 Monroe Street.

888
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:13,580
That's where we live.

889
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:16,959
Harper.

890
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:20,546
How would you feel if
Eleanor stayed with us

891
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,588
for a little while?

892
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:23,007
Her?

893
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:23,632
Yes!

894
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,634
No! No, she's weird.

895
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:29,388
Harper, sweetie.
Why are you being like this?

896
01:03:29,389 --> 01:03:33,267
I see her in my room at night.
She makes me do things.

897
01:03:33,685 --> 01:03:34,977
- What kind of things?
- That's impossible.

898
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:37,698
- What do you mean, Harper?
- She's never left the house until today.

899
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,732
She crashed my slumber party.

900
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:40,482
Okay?

901
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:41,442
She forces me to...

902
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,027
She's just a regular kid!

903
01:03:43,028 --> 01:03:43,986
She's a freak!

904
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:44,570
Okay.

905
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:45,404
Alright, you know what-

906
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:48,157
She makes me hug her
and kiss her at night.

907
01:03:48,158 --> 01:03:48,866
What?

908
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,659
Maybe we need some
more time to decide.

909
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,453
Okay Nancy, just-

910
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:53,203
Please.

911
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,079
I just think we need to-

912
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,456
We can't afford
to say no, Nancy.

913
01:03:55,457 --> 01:03:57,249
Yes we can afford. Yes we can.

914
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,667
That is our daughter-

915
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,086
I knew he was a freak
but not her.

916
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,004
Honey, honey, honey...

917
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,088
No! Don't tell me to.

918
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,483
- Don't say it.
- Can we calm down for one sec?

919
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:06,258
Just calm down for one second,
please!

920
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:13,557
Eleanor, you're fine, right?
Everything's alright.

921
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,601
You're my Dad, Steven.

922
01:04:15,602 --> 01:04:18,228
You like to fish but
you're not very good at it.

923
01:04:21,649 --> 01:04:22,649
Uh...

924
01:04:25,445 --> 01:04:27,237
Tell me you love me.

925
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,281
Uh...

926
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,826
Um...

927
01:04:34,371 --> 01:04:35,371
Sure.

928
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:37,915
Love you.

929
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,625
Do you love me Mom?

930
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,879
You know what, I'm - I'm sorry.

931
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,297
This is all a bit sudden.

932
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,256
I just need a little bit
more time.

933
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,217
I think it's time for you to go
and we'll discuss this later.

934
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:49,760
I just need a little bit
more time.

935
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:50,928
No our deal-

936
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:51,929
Tell me you love me.

937
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,555
Our deal was that she was
basically normal.

938
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,056
No!

939
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:54,973
We had a deal.

940
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:55,766
When you think about it-

941
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,768
Our deal was that she was
not a freak!

942
01:04:57,769 --> 01:04:58,519
Tell me you love me.

943
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,521
I think you should both go
so it doesn't get out of hand,

944
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:01,146
just, please.

945
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:02,523
Tell me you love me!

946
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:03,982
Nancy can we think about
this for one second?

947
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:05,692
Tell me you love me!

948
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:18,664
I love you. I love you.

949
01:05:22,794 --> 01:05:29,133
I love you. I love you.
I love you.

950
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:34,763
I love you sweetie. I love you.

951
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,557
You're my sweet little girl.

952
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,899
Let me go.

953
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:50,612
She got into my head.

954
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,573
Get out!

955
01:05:52,574 --> 01:05:54,174
- Get out of here!
- Just keep the money!

956
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,826
Get out or I'm calling 911!

957
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:56,994
Get out of here!

958
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,120
- Just keep the money.
- I'm sorry.

959
01:05:58,121 --> 01:05:59,121
It's okay.

960
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:00,914
I'm so sorry.

961
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:06,211
Sorry Daddy

962
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,880
What the hell is going on?

963
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,506
I don't want you to get mad.

964
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:10,799
When did this start?

965
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:12,968
You were supposed to tell me
when your eyes started bleeding.

966
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,052
What did she do now?

967
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,262
Shut up Alan!

968
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,973
What do you mean, shut up Alan?

969
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:19,433
No! Please!

970
01:06:19,434 --> 01:06:22,352
I can't trust you anymore to
follow the rules and stay safe.

971
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,396
You can't do that to people.

972
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,689
I promise I'll listen to you.

973
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,441
I won't go outside.

974
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:33,822
How long have you known?

975
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,324
What the hell do you think
you're gonna do?

976
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,825
Lock her up forever?

977
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,660
I'm keeping her safe from you.

978
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:40,329
Oh for Christ's sake.

979
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,331
In a shitbag like this?

980
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:46,335
You're not awake all the time
like you say you are.

981
01:06:46,336 --> 01:06:47,920
Don't start with your bullshit.

982
01:06:47,921 --> 01:06:52,466
She happens to be exactly what
we've been waiting for asshole!

983
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,594
It's okay. It's okay.

984
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:56,970
It's okay.

985
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,263
Shhh.

986
01:07:00,683 --> 01:07:01,683
It's okay.

987
01:07:04,229 --> 01:07:05,938
Up in the sky

988
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,149
birds sing a song

989
01:07:10,485 --> 01:07:15,572
between the clouds
they sing their love.

990
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:24,748
You'll always be
here with me, right?

991
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,379
Of course, sweetheart.

992
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,424
Even after they kill me.

993
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,135
I'll be right here.

994
01:07:37,637 --> 01:07:38,679
Right here.

995
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:40,597
Okay?

996
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:46,353
But you're already dead.

997
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,984
I'm not yet, honey.

998
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,194
Not yet.

999
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:06,540
Don't fucking touch me!

1000
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,416
Don't!

1001
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:09,751
Looks like you pissed off
somebody upstairs

1002
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:12,004
so finally you are going to pay.

1003
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:12,838
No!

1004
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:19,880
Chloe!

1005
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,013
Help!

1006
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:22,806
Help me Chloe!

1007
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,143
I said stay in the closet!

1008
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:27,644
They're taking Mom away!

1009
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,687
Your mom's dead!

1010
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:30,606
She's not dead, yet!

1011
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,233
Let me out! Let me out!

1012
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,526
You have to follow the rules!

1013
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:36,612
We have to save Mom!

1014
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:38,989
Please let me out!

1015
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,115
This is for your own good!

1016
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,241
I'm trying to keep you safe!

1017
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,242
Let me out!

1018
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:44,536
Daddy please!

1019
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,621
I'm sorry!

1020
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:46,747
Let me out! Let me out!

1021
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:47,748
Let me out!

1022
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,459
If you don't let me out
I'm going to kill you!

1023
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:05,349
Chloe?

1024
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,690
Chloe? Chloe!

1025
01:09:14,525 --> 01:09:16,318
Chloe! Stop!

1026
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,736
Chloe stop, stop, stop!

1027
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,363
No, no!

1028
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,958
I'm sorry love.

1029
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:33,335
I'm so sorry.

1030
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:34,920
I shouldn't have done that.

1031
01:09:35,588 --> 01:09:36,588
Are you okay?

1032
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:39,299
Say something.

1033
01:09:40,051 --> 01:09:42,260
Hey. Hey.

1034
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:59,027
She's coming back.

1035
01:10:04,117 --> 01:10:05,117
Hey.

1036
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,910
I'm sorry.

1037
01:10:07,286 --> 01:10:08,370
It's my fault.

1038
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,580
I was just scared.

1039
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:11,748
I shouldn't have done that
to you.

1040
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:12,958
Where's Mom?

1041
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,919
What did you see there?

1042
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,754
Don't start.

1043
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:19,214
What do you mean?

1044
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,299
If she had a vision of Mary
I gotta know it.

1045
01:10:21,968 --> 01:10:25,053
How could she have a vision
of Mary if Mary's dead?

1046
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:29,683
Alan?

1047
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:31,768
She's not dead yet.

1048
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,145
She's in the mountain.

1049
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,229
What?

1050
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:34,938
Look.

1051
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:39,109
When I found out that she
wasn't dead it was too late

1052
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,861
because you'd already taken
off with the kid.

1053
01:10:40,862 --> 01:10:42,154
Jesus Christ!

1054
01:10:42,155 --> 01:10:43,113
I thought she was dead.

1055
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:43,989
You left her there!

1056
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:47,033
No! I barely got out myself!

1057
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:47,826
And you know what-

1058
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:50,704
They're going to kill her.
She needs help.

1059
01:10:50,705 --> 01:10:51,705
Dad!

1060
01:10:53,249 --> 01:10:54,833
Yeah of course I blame you!

1061
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:57,043
You forced my wife to go
on a suicide mission!

1062
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,420
She's my daughter!

1063
01:10:58,838 --> 01:11:00,255
You left her there.

1064
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:03,216
It may have only been a few
months for you Alan

1065
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,927
but I've been in this house
for 7 fucking years!

1066
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:08,805
Well that's your problem!
You're fucking nuts!

1067
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,974
You can't go crazy on me.

1068
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,476
We need to be partners.

1069
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:14,019
Maybe we can get her out.

1070
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:17,063
I have tried again and again
and again while you're in here

1071
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:19,483
digging around and
taping up mail slots

1072
01:11:19,484 --> 01:11:20,817
or whatever the
hell you're doing.

1073
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:23,612
I'm not talking about one
of your ridiculous ideas.

1074
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:27,824
The only way you're going to get
in there is if they let you in.

1075
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:32,287
And the only way they will let
you in is with her.

1076
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,705
Oh, Chloe is going to have
nothing to do with this.

1077
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:35,165
No! Chloe is gonna do it!

1078
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:35,665
Dad!

1079
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,209
Are you insane?!

1080
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:38,293
- I'm not insane!
- Grandpa!

1081
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,962
I'm telling the truth! You've
never accepted the truth.

1082
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,839
There's only one way in there
and that's with her.

1083
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:43,840
Face it.

1084
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,093
She gets us in!
Which gets Mary out!

1085
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:47,719
Dad!

1086
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:48,720
What?

1087
01:11:50,181 --> 01:11:51,431
A wolf is here.

1088
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:56,645
And when we do we get
the reward?

1089
01:11:57,396 --> 01:11:59,064
When we verify their status.

1090
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,565
You'll be well taken care of.

1091
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:03,443
Okay, and you'll take them
to Madoc Mountain?

1092
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,530
I can't have them coming
back here.

1093
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:07,739
They'll know it was me.

1094
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:10,742
Madoc isn't set up to handle
Abnormal children.

1095
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:11,827
Too risky.

1096
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:14,830
Besides since Mary Louis
tried to blow the place up

1097
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:17,707
a few months ago they've
kept it mostly empty.

1098
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:21,711
And suspects only make it there
if they don't resist.

1099
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:23,588
And they usually resist.

1100
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,465
Good.

1101
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,885
That little Freak does things
to my daughter at night.

1102
01:12:31,389 --> 01:12:33,431
You can't hide this little girl
on your own anymore.

1103
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:34,349
I gotta help.

1104
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:35,642
Come on to my place.

1105
01:12:35,643 --> 01:12:37,477
I got it all figured out.

1106
01:12:37,812 --> 01:12:38,812
No.

1107
01:12:38,980 --> 01:12:41,439
Well then go out there and
take care of all of your shit!

1108
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,775
I don't kill anymore.

1109
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:47,070
Well I suggest that this might
be the perfect time

1110
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,030
to get over that phobia

1111
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:53,118
because if this man orders
a strike we're done.

1112
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:54,286
We're dust.

1113
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:55,787
You got that?

1114
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:00,292
Hello?

1115
01:13:01,878 --> 01:13:03,378
Sir is everything okay?

1116
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:12,721
Hello?

1117
01:13:29,363 --> 01:13:29,905
No!

1118
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,740
Chloe! No! No! No!

1119
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,916
No! No!

1120
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:42,500
She's a bleeder!

1121
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:43,585
Stop resisting!

1122
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:44,669
Open fire!

1123
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:54,512
Look what you've done.

1124
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:55,847
What I've done?

1125
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,474
Chloe saved us.

1126
01:13:57,892 --> 01:13:59,351
She saved us!

1127
01:13:59,810 --> 01:14:00,936
Come here honey.

1128
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:01,978
Get out!

1129
01:14:03,731 --> 01:14:04,439
No!

1130
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,315
Alan!

1131
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,107
Let me go!

1132
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,150
Let her go!

1133
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:08,318
Let me down!

1134
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:10,612
Where are you, you
invisible asshole?

1135
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,905
Let her go!

1136
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:13,406
Let me go!

1137
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,282
Let me down!

1138
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,284
Let me go!

1139
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,287
Chloe!

1140
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:23,625
If I ever see you again
I'll kill you,

1141
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,335
you piece of shit!

1142
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,769
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

1143
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:43,937
Mommy.

1144
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:53,071
Mommy?

1145
01:15:04,375 --> 01:15:05,667
Chloe?

1146
01:15:06,043 --> 01:15:07,127
Is that you?

1147
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,128
Mommy?

1148
01:15:08,963 --> 01:15:10,130
Where are you?

1149
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:26,271
Are they killing you now Mommy?

1150
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:30,775
Mary.

1151
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:35,196
Henry?

1152
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,074
I'm so scared.

1153
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,054
Device is armed.

1154
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:01,765
Ready to begin procedure
immediately.

1155
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:07,145
Go ahead.

1156
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:08,605
Do it.

1157
01:16:13,611 --> 01:16:15,737
I didn't - I didn't know
you were alive.

1158
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:18,031
I never would have left.

1159
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:20,283
I'm so sorry.

1160
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:20,867
No.

1161
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:21,701
It's all my fault.

1162
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:24,704
Don't do that.

1163
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,291
Just promise me you won't
let them touch Chloe.

1164
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:31,419
Promise me you won't let
them get away with this!

1165
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:33,880
Oh my God.

1166
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:36,800
Chloe.

1167
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:40,345
I love you, okay?

1168
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:41,805
Mommy loves you so much.

1169
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:43,640
Don't forget that.

1170
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:45,725
Mommy loves you so much, okay?

1171
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:47,685
Chloe?

1172
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,979
I love you, okay?

1173
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:54,639
- Mommy loves you so much.
- What are you doing with that?

1174
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:55,819
Hey!

1175
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:58,279
Goddamnit you can't
do this to her!

1176
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,155
Chloe!

1177
01:16:59,156 --> 01:16:59,864
We need your help!

1178
01:16:59,865 --> 01:17:01,366
Get away from her!
Get away from her!

1179
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:02,575
Damnit!

1180
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:03,993
Don't do it!!!

1181
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:06,663
No, no, no...

1182
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,377
Is something wrong?

1183
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:15,505
What are you doing?

1184
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:19,384
No, no, no!

1185
01:17:19,426 --> 01:17:20,426
Stop it!

1186
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,887
No! No!

1187
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,374
I love you too, Mommy.

1188
01:17:54,628 --> 01:17:55,628
Chloe?

1189
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:58,464
Oh my god.

1190
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:06,806
Shit!

1191
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,201
Shit.

1192
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:30,914
Now, no, no, you gotta
hold still for a minute.

1193
01:18:31,165 --> 01:18:32,248
Just like that.

1194
01:18:42,593 --> 01:18:44,135
Doesn't hurt, does it?

1195
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:50,850
We need to leave.

1196
01:18:51,268 --> 01:18:52,352
Now.

1197
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:54,229
You froze everyone.

1198
01:18:55,272 --> 01:18:56,397
I'm already too drained.

1199
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:58,233
I can't hold this for long,
okay?

1200
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,734
Then bring it back to normal.

1201
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:00,944
Then they'll get in!

1202
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,489
She wants to start a prison
break from the inside.

1203
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:08,034
But she can't do it if everyone
is frozen!

1204
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:10,161
We need to get out of here.

1205
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:11,955
I don't want to hide anymore.

1206
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:13,122
Chloe.

1207
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:14,207
Listen to me.

1208
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,167
The bad people are outside.

1209
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:18,253
If anything happens
to the agent out there,

1210
01:19:18,254 --> 01:19:21,256
we are never getting out
of here alive.

1211
01:19:23,259 --> 01:19:24,550
I can save Mom.

1212
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:26,344
It's our last chance.

1213
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:31,516
Talk to the lady outside.

1214
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,101
Just pretend you're normal.

1215
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:34,936
What?

1216
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:37,522
Like you taught me.

1217
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:53,246
I hate to be the one
to break it to you

1218
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:55,164
but you really look like shit

1219
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:56,958
Thanks.

1220
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:00,628
Here. Hydrogen peroxide.

1221
01:20:02,172 --> 01:20:03,756
It'll clear your eyes.

1222
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,342
You know something else?

1223
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,554
I got your back.

1224
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:17,145
And I've got a blue shirt
that matches your eyes.

1225
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,146
Wow.

1226
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:20,064
My eyes are green Alan.

1227
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:21,190
They are?

1228
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,191
But thanks.

1229
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:31,534
Hi.

1230
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:32,452
Is everything okay?

1231
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:33,328
Sorry to bother you.

1232
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:34,787
I'm Special Agent Cecilia Ray.

1233
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:35,788
ADF.

1234
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,457
ADF?

1235
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:38,541
There are freaks around?

1236
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:40,376
They're under our control.

1237
01:20:40,794 --> 01:20:42,045
Can I ask you some questions?

1238
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,213
I was just leaving actually.

1239
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:46,299
I have an appointment downtown.

1240
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,342
It's important.

1241
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:48,718
Can I come inside?

1242
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:55,350
Any weapons in the house?

1243
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:56,434
No.

1244
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:57,769
None that I know of.

1245
01:20:57,853 --> 01:21:00,271
Squatters have been in
and out so I don't know

1246
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,606
what they get up to.

1247
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:04,525
Take your glasses off.

1248
01:21:13,911 --> 01:21:14,911
So you don't live here?

1249
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:15,661
Huh?

1250
01:21:15,662 --> 01:21:16,954
Oh, no.

1251
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,082
I'm just the owner.

1252
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:21,626
You know I bought it with six
other condemned shitholes.

1253
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,420
I get in there and I tear them
down and I build them up.

1254
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:26,798
If you're in the market
let me know.

1255
01:21:27,091 --> 01:21:29,258
I found all this stuff here
this morning

1256
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,594
and I came to check it out.

1257
01:21:31,595 --> 01:21:34,138
Looks like there could have
been a child here.

1258
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,433
You don't think they were
Freaks do you?

1259
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,018
Could be.

1260
01:21:39,686 --> 01:21:42,126
Abnormals are known to hide in
abandoned properties like this.

1261
01:21:43,315 --> 01:21:45,441
Disgusting animals.

1262
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:47,068
Are you a father?

1263
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,611
Yeah.

1264
01:21:48,821 --> 01:21:50,071
Yes I am.

1265
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,531
Boy or girl?

1266
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:52,824
Boy.

1267
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:55,827
If you knew he'd be killed on
site wouldn't you do anything

1268
01:21:55,828 --> 01:21:57,578
you could to keep him safe?

1269
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:00,498
Yeah.

1270
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:02,208
I guess I would.

1271
01:22:06,088 --> 01:22:07,422
I'd love to meet him.

1272
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:10,091
Little devil's in summer camp.

1273
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:15,888
Chloe.

1274
01:22:16,181 --> 01:22:17,640
What do we do now Mom?

1275
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,308
I need to get outside.

1276
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:21,644
I can't defend myself
until I get outside.

1277
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:22,520
Can you help?

1278
01:22:22,521 --> 01:22:24,814
Yes Mommy but we have
to be quiet

1279
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,441
because the bad people
are here too.

1280
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,318
Okay but Chloe, listen to me,
there's not enough room for me

1281
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:31,195
to use my powers
underground here

1282
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:33,156
so we have to get out
before they sound the alarm

1283
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:35,741
because if it goes off I will
never be able to escape.

1284
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:36,826
You understand?

1285
01:22:37,286 --> 01:22:37,994
Yes.

1286
01:22:38,245 --> 01:22:39,287
Okay, come on.

1287
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,086
So uh...

1288
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,755
what happened across the street?

1289
01:22:49,756 --> 01:22:51,007
The Reed family.

1290
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,134
Turns out they were Abnormals.

1291
01:22:53,218 --> 01:22:55,303
Oh Jesus.

1292
01:22:55,929 --> 01:22:57,763
There goes my sale price.

1293
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,225
I never, you know,
thought this neighbourhood

1294
01:23:01,226 --> 01:23:02,643
would have Freaks in it.

1295
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,062
Makes sense though I guess.

1296
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:06,189
How so?

1297
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,941
Eh well you know, when I was
checking out this street

1298
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:09,942
I saw them.

1299
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:11,319
They were strange, you know.

1300
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,862
Accusing their neighbours
of stuff,

1301
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:15,865
lying all the time, random
piles of money around the house.

1302
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,452
And you didn't report them?

1303
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,205
I didn't think they were Freaks.

1304
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:24,373
Just thought they were assholes

1305
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:27,460
but I guess you
really can't tell.

1306
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,588
They look just like us, right?

1307
01:23:33,050 --> 01:23:35,092
Anyways I really need to get
to this appointment so...

1308
01:23:35,093 --> 01:23:35,843
Sit.

1309
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:36,844
Down.

1310
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:38,262
What?

1311
01:23:54,821 --> 01:23:55,821
I know who you are.

1312
01:23:56,073 --> 01:23:57,073
Excuse me?

1313
01:23:57,157 --> 01:23:58,324
This house according
to city records

1314
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:00,493
was foreclosed six months ago.

1315
01:24:00,577 --> 01:24:02,286
Western Trust Bank owns it.

1316
01:24:02,287 --> 01:24:03,746
Yeah, no, I'm actually
a developer;

1317
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:04,455
I work with the bank.

1318
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,456
Henry.

1319
01:24:05,832 --> 01:24:07,959
That's not the name of
the bank that owns it.

1320
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,337
And I can still smell
the peroxide on your face.

1321
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,051
Henry.

1322
01:24:18,679 --> 01:24:20,388
You are Henry Louis right?

1323
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:24,934
Your wife is Mary
and I'm pretty sure

1324
01:24:24,935 --> 01:24:28,187
your daughter is upstairs.

1325
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:46,706
Look.

1326
01:24:46,832 --> 01:24:49,166
It seems to me at this point
you have two options.

1327
01:24:49,418 --> 01:24:50,084
One.

1328
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,295
You can try to kill me at which
point my colleagues

1329
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:55,756
will hellfire the house
and we will all die.

1330
01:24:55,757 --> 01:24:58,509
There's a Reaper 10,000 feet
above us right now.

1331
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,637
Option two, and the reason
I came in here alone,

1332
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:05,099
was to convince you that
you can help Eleanor.

1333
01:25:06,602 --> 01:25:07,560
Or Chloe.

1334
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:08,936
Whatever her name is.

1335
01:25:21,116 --> 01:25:22,325
I'm listening.

1336
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:33,419
Hey Rob.

1337
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:34,670
Did you see the game?

1338
01:25:34,671 --> 01:25:35,713
Dodgers are in, man.

1339
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:37,340
Playoffs this year.

1340
01:25:40,177 --> 01:25:42,762
Baseball is my favourite sport.

1341
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:46,098
Yeah.

1342
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,142
Yeah, me too, Rob.

1343
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:56,859
I'm a parent too.

1344
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,820
I know you want the best
for Chloe.

1345
01:26:01,114 --> 01:26:03,407
If half of what your neighbours
say is true about her,

1346
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,284
she's remarkable.

1347
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:07,870
And very valuable to us.

1348
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:09,413
Valuable?

1349
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,332
Valuable as a weapon.

1350
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,626
No, no, no, no.

1351
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,337
As a symbol.

1352
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:20,966
With us she'd be safe and
with the right training

1353
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:23,761
she could even do some good
in the world.

1354
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:26,138
Wouldn't you want that?

1355
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:31,018
Will I ever get to see
her again?

1356
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:41,779
I want to be honest with you so
that you know you can trust me.

1357
01:26:43,657 --> 01:26:44,907
You will be killed.

1358
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,576
You will sacrifice
your life for hers.

1359
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:52,498
But I mean, you've already
been doing that, haven't you?

1360
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:58,212
I never wanted the world
to turn her into a Freak.

1361
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:01,716
She's just a girl.

1362
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:06,637
I know exactly what you mean.

1363
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:17,189
And you?

1364
01:27:18,442 --> 01:27:20,651
Won't you put the gun down
and do what's best

1365
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:21,986
for your granddaughter?

1366
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:31,162
A hellfire missile takes 60
seconds from launch to strike.

1367
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:35,624
And he and I both know
that in that 60 seconds

1368
01:27:35,625 --> 01:27:38,711
we can do a goddamn
bunch of damage.

1369
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:40,963
Alan.

1370
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:42,423
Calm down.

1371
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:46,802
We need more time to think.

1372
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:52,266
Dr. Daulby didn't radio
in after procedure.

1373
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,143
Can you go to the
execution chamber

1374
01:27:54,144 --> 01:27:55,394
and see if he's in there?

1375
01:27:55,645 --> 01:27:57,188
Copy that. On my way.

1376
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:00,441
Mommy?

1377
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:02,860
They're gonna find out.

1378
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:07,740
Chloe?

1379
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:09,992
No!

1380
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:11,619
Chloe!

1381
01:28:14,331 --> 01:28:15,998
Oh shit!

1382
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,714
Nobody move.

1383
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,720
You're not gonna shoot me.

1384
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:52,789
Hold the hellfire.
I'm coming out with the girl.

1385
01:29:01,211 --> 01:29:03,212
No, Chloe! No! No! Chloe!

1386
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:06,090
No! Come on!
Oh my God.

1387
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:10,135
You're freeing her.
Such a waste.

1388
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:35,828
Oh, no.

1389
01:29:35,829 --> 01:29:36,495
Chloe. No, no.

1390
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,372
Don't do this.

1391
01:29:38,832 --> 01:29:40,624
Don't you dare!

1392
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:46,463
Don't you want a normal life?

1393
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:54,930
Grandpa!

1394
01:29:58,768 --> 01:30:00,811
I'm fine.

1395
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:03,731
Just go to your Mom.

1396
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:22,374
Let's go get it done.

1397
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,357
Agent Ray.

1398
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,484
Agent Ray, come in!

1399
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,195
Agent Ray. We heard gunfire.

1400
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:52,613
Agent Ray, do you copy?

1401
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,448
Let's try to slow them down.

1402
01:30:57,077 --> 01:30:58,827
I have your agent hostage.

1403
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,205
Move away from the house.

1404
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,295
Keep going.

1405
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:47,876
Okay sir.

1406
01:31:48,003 --> 01:31:49,670
Let's just try to calm down.

1407
01:31:49,671 --> 01:31:52,423
I just want to talk
to Agent Ray alright.

1408
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,135
You better get away
from my house

1409
01:31:56,136 --> 01:32:01,056
or I'm going to melt all your
brains with my Freak powers!

1410
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,850
Okay no problem sir.

1411
01:32:02,851 --> 01:32:04,810
We're moving back.

1412
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,312
I just want to make sure
my friend's okay.

1413
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:32,880
Dad!

1414
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:35,549
I can't help Mom
when she's frozen!

1415
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,217
Just a second honey!

1416
01:33:30,522 --> 01:33:31,939
Launch hellfire!

1417
01:33:59,801 --> 01:34:01,468
Stay back! Stay back!

1418
01:34:01,469 --> 01:34:02,386
Let's go! Let's go!

1419
01:34:02,387 --> 01:34:04,054
Move it! Move it! Move it!

1420
01:34:33,668 --> 01:34:35,252
Chloe, can you hear me?

1421
01:34:35,628 --> 01:34:36,879
I need you!

1422
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:38,630
Chloe! I need you!

1423
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,924
Chloe, get up! I need
to get outside!

1424
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,051
Chloe please get up,
you can do this.

1425
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:44,469
You can do it Chloe.

1426
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:46,096
Chloe can you hear me?

1427
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:46,847
Open the door!

1428
01:34:46,848 --> 01:34:48,682
They're going to kill me!

1429
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:51,059
I need you!

1430
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,154
You know where to find me mommy?

1431
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:45,864
Yeah, I can feel you.

1432
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:01,273
Daddy?

1433
01:37:01,566 --> 01:37:02,566
Dad?

1434
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:04,526
Daddy?

1435
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:06,111
Wake up!

1436
01:37:06,195 --> 01:37:07,195
Dad!

1437
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:08,697
Can you hear me?

1438
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:15,906
Hey.

1439
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,667
I'm so proud of you.

1440
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,838
I love you so much!

1441
01:37:25,923 --> 01:37:28,759
And I am so sorry.

1442
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,388
You are special.

1443
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:44,733
Partners?

1444
01:37:48,571 --> 01:37:49,696
Partners.

1445
01:38:02,919 --> 01:38:04,086
No!

1446
01:38:06,923 --> 01:38:08,882
Please come back.

1447
01:38:12,637 --> 01:38:13,929
Come back.

1448
01:38:20,228 --> 01:38:21,228
No.

1449
01:38:23,439 --> 01:38:24,731
Come back.

1450
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:28,568
Please come back.

1451
01:38:29,362 --> 01:38:30,445
Wake up.

1452
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:34,908
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

1453
01:38:39,247 --> 01:38:41,915
Come back, come back, come back.

1454
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:15,866
Oh shit!

1455
01:39:46,522 --> 01:39:47,272
Mom?

1456
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:49,441
Chloe!

1457
01:40:09,545 --> 01:40:10,921
Are you okay?

1458
01:40:14,884 --> 01:40:16,259
Listen to me.

1459
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:20,263
I will protect you
from now on, okay?

1460
01:40:20,598 --> 01:40:22,432
And we'll find a new place
to hide.

1461
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:23,725
No.

1462
01:40:24,894 --> 01:40:26,853
I don't want to hide anymore.

1463
01:40:27,605 --> 01:40:29,648
I'm sorry baby, but we have to.

1464
01:40:29,941 --> 01:40:30,565
We have to.

1465
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,776
We can live wherever we want.
