1
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,200
Isha, get up dear...

2
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,942
Deep, get up!
Vijay, get up!!

3
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,795
Take this.
Slowly.

4
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,671
Thief! Thief!!

5
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,453
What are you looking at?
Hit him!

6
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:56,256
It's you!!

7
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,889
You play lot of mischief!!

8
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,366
And even you all are a part of it.

9
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,333
Come on, childrens...
Come, my army!

10
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,806
Now, I'll open my shop & show it to you all.

11
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,366
What have I bought for you?

12
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,344
Switch it off or else it will fly!

13
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,689
There are lots of garnes in it.

14
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,287
This is for you...

15
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,971
Why do you always enter the house
like a suspense film hero?

16
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,507
To teach a lesson to yourmother!

17
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,908
If some instance happens like this
then she should be able to face it!

18
00:05:45,411 --> 00:05:47,647
What was she telling?
Thief! Thief!!

19
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,706
Look who is it?
Look who is it?

20
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,347
There should be some courage. Isn't it?

21
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:56,620
But, papa. What kind of tour this is...
where you can't even stay for 10 days with us.

22
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,423
What shall I do, my sweet heart!
My duty is as such.

23
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,325
Take us to see a film today, papa.

24
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:12,199
So, you want to go to see a film.
Okay, I'll surely take you all.

25
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:18,300
Now, we'll get ready to go to school.
Yes, of course!

26
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:30,550
Hey, what are you doing this?

27
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,349
The children's have gone to school.
Now, it's you & myself!

28
00:06:35,795 --> 00:06:39,595
Look, full stop after 2...
So that wife remalns tlp top!

29
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,797
Even in these tlmes, you've made me mother of 4!

30
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,761
Sorry, I don't want any more kids now!

31
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,397
Shall I do my family planning?

32
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,379
It's women who do family planning!
Why shall you do it?

33
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:54,509
I'll do it.

34
00:06:56,015 --> 00:07:01,783
From the day, you've come into my life...
I haven't pinched you at your cheek!

35
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,556
Whether the sign of my nails doesn't appear.

36
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,659
How could I allow doctor's knife
to operate on your body?

37
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,254
Whethermy heart will not cut into pieces!!

38
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,396
Why are you staring at me like this?

39
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,239
I couldn't really make out whether
you are a good or bad guy!

40
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:22,606
Means?

41
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:27,678
I mean, you love me a lot!
But, you never listen to my that...

42
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,816
Forget it! I have to go.
It's time formy class.

43
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:45,695
Greetlngs!
Greetlngs!!

44
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,181
The Ashram students are learning it fondly!

45
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:11,451
Melody arises even from lifeless stones
with Tulsi's singing!!

46
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,327
This is your greatness that you are praising me!

47
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,817
I'll move. It's tlme for class.

48
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:28,605
Students, there is some power which runs
not only this earth but the whole galaxy!

49
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,366
Today, we'll pray to that power itself.

50
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,202
We will ask something from it.

51
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,276
Not only for us but for everybody in this world!

52
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,247
Give it!

53
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:01,838
Tell me one thing.

54
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,581
You go on tour once, but ask for advance twice.
What is it?

55
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,413
Is it going from your pocket?
Boss told me to take advance as permy wish.

56
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,248
I have to take my family for outing.
That's why...

57
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,291
I know your habit very well.

58
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,696
You drarnatlze on behalf of your family!

59
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,698
Don't ask for any advance henceforth.
You said this even last tlme.

60
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,239
But, this is last tlme.
Each tlme you say the sarne thing.

61
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,241
Yes, of cours. E!
Atleast sign & go...

62
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:45,257
Okay...

Hey, it's your phone.

64
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,465

66
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,894
No! Today I've to take my family for outing.

67
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:00,805
Not today!

68
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,401
It's been long tlme.
Please come.

69
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,279
I'll come for a short tlme.
Atleast you come.

00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:16,582
Deep, are you ready?
Yes, I'm ready.

72
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,588
Bring everybody out.

73
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,395
Hey Suraj, our friendship should be
like liquor & kebabs. Isn't it?

74
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:34,361
No, it should be like whisky & soda!!

75
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,300
Mummy, it's 8 p.m. & papa hasn't yet come.

76
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,241
He might be coming...
Must have stuck in some work.

77
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:51,884
Pa. Pa has come!!
Daddy has come!!

78
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:08,265
Hey, my childrens...

79
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,268
Look, what have I bought for you.

80
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:18,640
Mom, you said that papa will not drink
& we'll take us to see movie tonlght.

81
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:23,217
Isha, take him...
You'll go inside.

82
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:53,212
Tulsi, do you know why do I drink?

83
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,282
I drink it forpaln!

84
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,791
What is my paln?

85
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:07,893
I feel that I'm doing some mistake!

86
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:14,235
And the mistake is that I'm drinking!!

87
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:21,270
And when I drink, you feel sad!

88
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:28,843
When you feel sad, even I feel sad!!
So, I drink!

89
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,789
But, you don't worry!
I'm there...

90
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,916
You broke children's heart!

91
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:41,233
Children's heart never breaks!!

92
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,360
What have you bought?
Chicken lollypop!!

93
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,363
Pizza...

94
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,198
Come in, have your dinner.

95
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,327
Did children had their dinner?
Yes.

96
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,374
Did you eat?
Tell me something...

97
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,842
What do you get after drinking everyday?

98
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,385
I feel good!

99
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,490
I feel that I've become alive!

100
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,550

00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:49,296
Then, I feel like loving you!!

103
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,838
I feel that I've become a millionaire!
I could give you anything.

104
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,296
I'm fed up! Why don't you understand?

105
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:02,179
You are invitlng death by drinking everyday!
Really?

106
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,706
Why don't you unders. Tand?

107
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,656
Okay! I'll not drink from tomorrow.

108
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:12,351
I swear on my head!

109
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,721
Lets go, the food is gettlng cold!

110
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,230
Put the food on your head to warm it!

111
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,531
My anger seems to diminlsh with your talks!!
Let's go.

112
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:33,342
Be careful!

113
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,246
You yourself will fall along with me as well.

114
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:57,931
Greetlngs!!
Long live, dear.

115
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,266
Please forgive me for coming a little late.

116
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:05,169
It's not little but more late!

117
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:15,216
As per the Ashram. Rule, no one can live
in the room here more than 5 years!

118
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,824
And for you it's more than 10 years.!!

119
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:27,731
Swarniji couldn't refuse you on the
behest of your children's & yourself.

120
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:32,263
But, there's a lot of notlces
come from the organizatlon.

121
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:38,941
The room of Ashrarn in which you live,
shall be taken back.

122
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,641
Dear, don't feel bad!

123
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:51,211
How could I feel bad when you all
thought good for us all these years.!!

124
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,692
But, when thunder strikes, someone is burnt!

125
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,364
It seems I'm going to burn this tlme.

126
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:03,425
Why do you say this, dear?
The othernarne of life is struggle!

127
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:10,297
If my husband wasn't a drunkard, then
we could have bulld our own house tlll now.

128
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,645
I think my fate is as such.

129
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,704
The whole fault is of your husband!

130
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:17,907
Today, I'll make him qult his liquor!

131
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:21,242
I'll see how do he don't listen to me?

132
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:35,665
Hey, Suraj...

133
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:48,240
Wait...
Hey, Suraj...

134
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:58,321
You scoundrel!

135
00:21:30,822 --> 00:21:33,347
Greetings, Suraj brother!!
Come, sit.

136
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,224
Bring me a quarter.

137
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:40,632
You seem to be tensed.
What's the problem?

138
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,691
That Swami is following me.
Who?

139
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,398
Give me Soda.
Take it from here.

140
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,695
Hey, Suraj brother.
You are going down...

141
00:22:09,695 --> 00:22:11,496
No, nothing.
Come what may happen now...

142
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,623
Hey Rajendra, that table number3...

143
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,261
Swamiji? Here??

144
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:25,405
May be he has come to drink!
But, he is shy of coming inside.

145
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,821
He is asking after coming to the bar
that whetherit is there?

146
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:41,754
Whether you'll get milk inspite of liquor here!!

147
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:47,455
Swamiji, everything is there.
But, do come inside.

148
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:54,238
If I'll go from front, he will run away.
Therefore, he s calling me from back doors!

149
00:22:58,009 --> 00:22:59,271
Sit, here.

150
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,176
Sir, what will you take?

151
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,818
Beer, whisky, Ginn, vodka...

152
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,414
You scoundrel, illiterate!!

153
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,493
Have I come here to drink liquor?

154
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:17,394
If not, then why did you come here?

155
00:23:19,364 --> 00:23:23,528
I have come here to qult Suraj's liquor!

156
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,797
Houses get ruined because of drinking.

157
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,674
Drinking isn't a good habit!

158
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,712
If you have such good thoughts for me then
you should have bought a bowl forme as well.

159
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:34,406
Why?

160
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,944
If you stop everybody's liquor then,
my shop will be closed forever!!

161
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:42,387
Then, I have to take the bowl to beg for alms!!

162
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,447
Give upon the narne of God!!

163
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:51,492
You please go from here.
No, I won't go tlll I qult Suraj's liquor.

164
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,292
You will have to go!

165
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,891
Hurry up! My throat is drying!!

166
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,535
Swamiji in the bar!
What tlme has come.

167
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:06,778
If you were having this much urge for liquor
then, you should have told me.

168
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,372
You scoundrel! Stop your nonsense!!

169
00:24:10,382 --> 00:24:12,782
What will you serve me & what will I drink?

170
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,221
You'll drink wine, since you've come here.

171
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,746
We'll sit & have 2 pegs together.

172
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,186
I was out of my mind that I carne here.

173
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:24,896
What wrong did I tell him?
I only sald 2 pegs!

174
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:28,400
Why did you said only 2 pegs?
He is bound to get angry!

175
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,732
You should have told 2 bottles!!

176
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,669
Yourfriend Suraj...
How much he loves his wife & kids!!

177
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:38,372
And you...

178
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:45,817
Tulsi is that much pretty too!

179
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:50,251
And listen...

180
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,581
What will that Suraj love her?

181
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:04,764
If she agrees, I swear that
I'll spend my entlre life on her!!

182
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,841
These swirling hips!!

183
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:55,830
Tulsi, give me the basket.

184
00:25:56,738 --> 00:25:59,070
Your hands are very gentle!
Leave my hand.

185
00:26:00,676 --> 00:26:03,578
I swear, you don't look mother of 4.

186
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:04,602
Stop your nonsense!!

187
00:26:05,681 --> 00:26:09,117
Tulsi, I don't like you see walking everyday.

188
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:11,620
I'll buy you a ladies bike!

189
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,144
Qulckly to Ashram. & qulckly to home!!

190
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:14,716
Only couple of times in a week...

191
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,494
Come & teach music to my kids.

192
00:26:22,531 --> 00:26:25,523
I don't have the necessity to go to houses & teach.
But, I do have.

193
00:26:25,934 --> 00:26:29,597
Look Tulsi, your husband remalns out
of house for 15 days, along with his car.

194
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:32,634
And the rest of the days,
he is intoxicated with liquor!

195
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,072
What happiness he could give you?

196
00:26:35,644 --> 00:26:39,102
Shall I give you?
That's enough!

197
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,741
I warn you for the last time.

198
00:26:43,051 --> 00:26:46,111
If you do it again, I'll inform my husband!

199
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:48,655
And you very well know how my husband is?

200
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:56,826
She went away ringing the bell!

201
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:35,534
Liquor has started darnaging your liver now...

202
00:27:37,639 --> 00:27:40,608
Suraj, if you want to live more...
Qult alcohol!

203
00:27:40,976 --> 00:27:43,604
I'm tlred of telling him!
He doesn't leave it.

204
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,143
I wish to qult but, it doesn't leave.

205
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,482
Then, you will have to lose this world!

206
00:27:50,285 --> 00:27:53,652
Look Suraj, there's a doctorin Shyarngaon.
Dr. Raj Sharma...

207
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:55,984
who gives herbal medicine...

208
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:59,759
From which you'll be able to qult alcohol!

209
00:28:00,862 --> 00:28:04,025
Okay, I'll send him tomorrow morning itself.

210
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,566
Is it really necessary to fetch medicine?

211
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:10,465
Your liveris being darnaged by alcohol.
You will die!

212
00:28:10,672 --> 00:28:12,640
There's no connectlon of liquor with liver!

213
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:17,612
Those who don't drink, even die!
But, who drink lives a longer life!!

214
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:21,516
Look at our washer man, his age is 60 years...
He drinks day & nlght.

215
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:23,711
There's no problem at all.
He is fit & healthy!

216
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:28,020
And that milk man, he never touched liquor...
died at the age of 25 years.!!

217
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,484
There is no connectlon of alcohol with liver!

218
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,561
In fact, alcohol is tonlc for body!

219
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:37,156
So, alcohol is tonlc!
Yes, it is.

220
00:28:37,666 --> 00:28:39,759
I didn't know that it is good for health.

221
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:42,094
So, even I'll start drinking from today onwards.
What?

222
00:28:42,571 --> 00:28:43,833
Liquor!
No.

223
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:45,774
It's not good for woman!!

224
00:28:45,774 --> 00:28:49,232
Why? Men have 2 livers??
No!

225
00:28:49,778 --> 00:28:53,578
Look, when you will leave drinking.
Your health will be fine!

226
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:56,642
If you aren't healthy, then what
will happen to our children's?

227
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,147
Please leave alcohol.

228
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,489
Return just as you are going.
Absolutely fresh! Okay?

229
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,524
Move...

230
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,888
Be qulck!

231
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,523
You are gettlng late for the school.

232
00:29:54,743 --> 00:29:58,679
Everybody has 1 God in their house.
Why do we have 3 God's?

233
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:02,683
How much faces does God have...
He is only One.

234
00:30:02,751 --> 00:30:03,911
I didn't understand...

235
00:30:07,656 --> 00:30:08,680
Let me explaln you.

236
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:11,492
What do you call papa in English?
Father.

237
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,588
In Hindi?
Pltaaji.

238
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:16,188
And in Urdu?
Abbaji

239
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:19,532
But, the meaning of all 3 is one.

240
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,464
Whetherit's Allah for Muslim, God for Christlans
& Ram for Hindus.

241
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:28,641
All the 3 are one!

242
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:37,610
Everybody in their own ways worship God
to get rid of sorrows!

243
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:42,589
No matter by what narne they call...
But the one who listens is the sarne.

244
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:45,216
Do you remember Gandhiji's saying?

245
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:01,668
Mom, what did you ask from God today?

246
00:31:03,645 --> 00:31:07,638
Everyday, I ask the sarne thing from God...
that your father qults alcohol.

247
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:48,657
Stop the bus!
Stop!!

248
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:50,989
But, why are you stopping the bus?

249
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:52,227
I want to get down.

250
00:31:52,227 --> 00:31:53,922
But, you've taken a tlcket for Shyamgaon?

251
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:58,224
I know it. It's upto me wherever I wish...
I've taken the tickets!

252
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,167
Did you do the homework?
Yes, I did.

253
00:32:10,979 --> 00:32:12,412
Even, I did it.

254
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:21,790
Where is your father?

255
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:24,020
He has gone to the town.
He'll be back within 2 days!

256
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:28,063
He could even come today evenlng,
if he completes his job!!

257
00:32:28,063 --> 00:32:31,692
You seem to chatter very much!!
Like Tulsi...

258
00:32:32,634 --> 00:32:33,623
Are you'll going to school?

259
00:32:33,902 --> 00:32:38,601
No, we are going to a disco, wearing this uniform
along with our books!!

260
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,144
Come on go...
The bell has rung!!

261
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:25,510
You?
Yes, it's me.

262
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:28,521
He is not at home.
Therefore, I've come here.

263
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,584
Means?

264
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:35,063
Now, even a married woman has
to be explained the meaning of this?

265
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,121
Get away from here!!

266
00:33:39,534 --> 00:33:43,937
The bottle of the infant is empty.
I'm a milk tra. Der...

267
00:33:45,507 --> 00:33:47,907
I'll flow rivers. Of milk for you.
Get away, I sald!

268
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:52,677
Look Tulsi...
I've driven huge tempos & trucks in my life!!

269
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:56,983
But, I have never driven a
gentle vehicle like you!!

270
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:05,849
I've tasted several. Women in my life!
But, never tasted a melodious woman like you!

271
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:09,959
Look, let's have fun!
Get out of here!!

272
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:11,432
Do agree...

273
00:34:11,432 --> 00:34:14,424
I'm your friend's wife!
Be mine for sometime.

274
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,551
Leave me!!

275
00:34:38,226 --> 00:34:40,524
Leave me!!
What are you doing?

276
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,662
Get out of here!!

277
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:26,665
Vijay, Deep... stop!

278
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:28,735
Isha, come back!

279
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:11,540
Take it.

280
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:14,113
Vijay, take it.

281
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,567
I'll tell you why did I drink?

282
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,604
That doctor...

283
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:14,811
That doctor told me that

284
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,450
he can't give me medicine.

285
00:37:23,257 --> 00:37:26,522
He said that my liver
isn't ready for the medicine.

286
00:37:34,635 --> 00:37:37,229
He told me to drink for one month!
Drink plenty of it!

287
00:37:37,772 --> 00:37:42,334
And then I'll give you medicine.
And it will work then...

288
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:54,179
I swear on you

289
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:58,822
I'm sorry!
My swear...

290
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,688
I was just telling...

291
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,525
Till yesterday you only got drunk...

292
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:09,501
Now you've started telling lies from today!

293
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,072
You don't care for us!

294
00:38:16,511 --> 00:38:18,172
Are you aware what all we have to pass through?

295
00:38:19,914 --> 00:38:23,475
Even if we die, you'll survive on liquor!

296
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,614
But, you'll never change!
What are you telling?

297
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:31,648
Do you know what does
the society thinks of me?

298
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,555
Wife of a drunkard!

299
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:38,897
And our childrens...
Drunkard's childrens!!

300
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:48,237
Are you aware of what look does
the society gives to such childrens?

301
00:38:51,846 --> 00:38:53,245
I have to listen to such taunts!

302
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:57,748
How will your husband keep you happy?

303
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,781
I feel like dying after listening such taunts!!

304
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,222
Why are you talking such?

305
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:13,793
I've nearly saved myself from burning!

306
00:39:18,473 --> 00:39:19,667
What is the point in telling you all this?

307
00:39:26,214 --> 00:39:27,681
Tell me what happened?

308
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:30,114
Tell me what happened?

309
00:39:34,055 --> 00:39:39,584
Papa, your friend Vikram. Broke into the house
& tried to molest Mom!

310
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:13,694
Let's talk in the bar.
In the bar?

311
00:40:13,694 --> 00:40:14,922
Let's talk in your neighborhood.

312
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,858
In your house...
Vandana...

313
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,492
What happened?

314
00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:26,541
You call me brother?
Yes.

315
00:40:26,541 --> 00:40:27,838
So, you are my sister.
Yes.

316
00:40:28,543 --> 00:40:30,909
What would be the relatlon
of my wife with this pig?

317
00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:32,503
Sister!

318
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:37,476
This bastard has tried to molest his sister!!

319
00:41:11,452 --> 00:41:13,682
From which mouth did you say that to her?

320
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,615
Get away, sister in law.

321
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:47,021
I beg of you!
Please forgive him.

322
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:49,512
For the sake of my children...

323
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:05,605
Hence forth, if you ever tried to look
towards my house, I'll kill you!

324
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,105
He is really a scoundrel!

325
00:42:17,485 --> 00:42:19,120
He is a very bad man!

326
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,452
He will surely remember this day forever!!

327
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:24,524
He will get rotten with worms!!

328
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:58,057
Your husband has abused me
before the whole neighborhood...

329
00:43:00,695 --> 00:43:08,693
He has only hurt my body...
But, I'll ruin his entlre life!!

330
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:11,038
Leep this in mind!

331
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,064
Vijay... didn't we had lot of fun yesterday?

332
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:03,900
Papa is really great!

333
00:47:04,672 --> 00:47:06,674
Did you see how much happy the kids are?

334
00:47:06,674 --> 00:47:08,876
Give me papa, I'll press your shirt.

335
00:47:08,876 --> 00:47:11,674
The lines from the fore head of your
mother has vanished!

336
00:47:11,946 --> 00:47:14,642
What difference does it make
if there's lines on my shirt?

337
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:20,010
Isha, take care of the child!
I'll pack your papa's bag.

338
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:23,958
Pa. Pa, you know that you are going to town...
Qulckly give your shirt!

339
00:47:23,958 --> 00:47:25,585
Forget this & tell me what do you want
me to bring for you.

00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,630
One Punjabi sult with silk thread embroidery!

00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,224
Along with that veil which has golden border!!

342
00:47:33,567 --> 00:47:34,056
What do you want?

343
00:47:34,668 --> 00:47:37,899
I want an imported bat!
Like Rarnesh has.

344
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:41,701
He acts too smart with that bat.

345
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:44,633
I'll bring Sachin Tendulkar's bat for you.

346
00:47:45,512 --> 00:47:47,639
Then, he will envy your bat!

347
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,712
What do you want?
A super computer!

348
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:53,819
You study too much!
You'll surely become a doctor!!

349
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:55,913
And what about me?

350
00:47:56,857 --> 00:47:58,759
You are a stylish boy,
I'll make you a hero!

351
00:47:58,759 --> 00:48:00,556
I'll become an inspector!

352
00:48:03,931 --> 00:48:07,594
And what will you become?

353
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:16,569
I've put lemon pickle in the bag.

354
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,942
Don't remaln hungry for your dislike
for hotel food.

355
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:22,948
Atleast eat little along with this pickle.

356
00:48:23,717 --> 00:48:26,811
What shall I bring for you?
I don't want anything.

357
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:28,987
You left liquoris enough for me!

358
00:48:29,757 --> 00:48:32,123
But, what will this poor guy get?

359
00:48:41,135 --> 00:48:42,067
Hey papa...

360
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,884

Say, Bye to papa...

364
00:49:31,819 --> 00:49:33,878
Pa. Pa, will you race.

365
00:49:34,855 --> 00:49:36,516
Be ready, papa.

366
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:41,658
Today, I'll defeat you.

367
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:06,685
I won!

368
00:50:09,523 --> 00:50:10,046
That's it!

369
00:50:10,791 --> 00:50:11,780
That's it!

370
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:17,588
You defeated a car!

371
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:20,459
Now, go home.
Okay, papa.

372
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:43,621
Son Suraj, today I'll ring your bells...

373
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:48,558
I'll darken your home forever!

374
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,720
Is my son really very serious?
There's a huge blood loss.

375
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,821
But, don't worry!

376
00:51:47,821 --> 00:51:49,618
He will be alright after blood transmission!

377
00:51:51,225 --> 00:51:54,717
The blood group of mother & son are sarne.
Take Tulsi's blood! Okay, Sir.

378
00:52:21,121 --> 00:52:23,021
Stop taking Tulsi's blood.
Okay, Sir.

379
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,716
Varsha, stop taking her blood!
Okay!

380
00:52:55,622 --> 00:52:58,887
How is his conditlon, now?
Doctor says he will be aright.

381
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,627
There's nothing to worry!

382
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:09,694
Doctoris calling.
Not you, but Swamiji.

383
00:53:10,804 --> 00:53:13,068
There's nothing to worry!
I'll see it.

384
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,445
Please be seated, Swamiji.

385
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:27,177
What is the relation of yours with Tulsi?

386
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,681
Tulsi & her husband Sura. J...
Both are orphan!

387
00:53:31,091 --> 00:53:36,051
They grew up in our Ashrarn &
they happened to love each other.

388
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:42,030
Where is Tulsi's husband right now?
He is on a tour with his employer.

389
00:53:42,602 --> 00:53:44,661
So, whom shall I talk to right now?

390
00:53:45,205 --> 00:53:49,107
Doctor, you could speak to me.
Tulsi is like my daughter.

391
00:53:52,946 --> 00:53:54,470
Call Tulsi.
Okay, Sir.

392
00:53:57,617 --> 00:53:59,175
Doctoris calling you.

393
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:09,460
Yes, doctor!

394
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:13,960
There's nothing to fear for...
Your son will be fine!

395
00:54:14,801 --> 00:54:18,430
Tulsi, do you always have
headache & body ache?

396
00:54:22,209 --> 00:54:25,178
Nothing that sort of happens to my son.

397
00:54:25,479 --> 00:54:28,175
I'm not asking about your son but you.

398
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:34,047
You are talking about me?

399
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:37,014
Do you bleed sometlme from the nose?

400
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,585
Yes, but sometlmes.

401
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:44,624
How many tlme did it happen?

402
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:49,628
I don't remember exactly. But...
I've taken medicine from the doctor.

403
00:54:49,836 --> 00:54:51,701
He sald that it's sinus problem!

404
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,475
Do you feel dizzy along with headache?
Yes, it happens sometimes.

405
00:54:59,513 --> 00:55:03,142
But, becomes normal after taking paln killer tablet.

406
00:55:03,617 --> 00:55:05,608
Okay, you walt outside.
I'll call you.

407
00:55:13,627 --> 00:55:18,621
It's the son who has met with an accident &
you are asking his mother about her health!

408
00:55:20,033 --> 00:55:25,630
We accidentally carne to know about
mother's bad health due to son's accident.

409
00:55:25,939 --> 00:55:27,133
This is a coincidence!

410
00:55:27,707 --> 00:55:30,505
When we tested mother's blood
to tran. Smit in her son's body.

411
00:55:31,111 --> 00:55:33,579
When the chief technician
of our lab got suspicion.

412
00:55:34,648 --> 00:55:37,549
Therefore, we had to ask
certaln questlon to Tulsi.

413
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:41,848
See, this is Tulsi's blood report!

414
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:27,559
Tell me Swarniji... Why did they
not give my blood to my son?

415
00:56:27,934 --> 00:56:29,629
What is the reason behind their questlons?

416
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:33,697
Tulsi, when will Sura. J return?

417
00:56:34,908 --> 00:56:37,172
Why are you asking about Sura. J?

418
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:40,678
What is that thing which you are hiding from me?

419
00:56:41,915 --> 00:56:45,851
Is there any threat to the life of my son

420
00:56:46,753 --> 00:56:50,655
No, Tulsi. Your son's life is well secured!

421
00:56:55,529 --> 00:56:56,154
But...

422
00:57:00,934 --> 00:57:03,698
Doctors. Have advised you to take rest.

423
00:57:04,938 --> 00:57:08,931
They have restricted you to think
& put pressure on the brai. N!

424
00:57:09,543 --> 00:57:11,010
But, what happened to me?

425
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,705
I'm hale & hearty!

426
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:20,678
You shall remaln hale & hearty! Therefore,
doctors. Have advised you to take rest.

427
00:57:21,488 --> 00:57:24,116
No, Swamiji...
There's something for sure.

428
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:26,490
Which you are hiding from me.

429
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:30,458
Tell me clearly what happened to me?

430
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:38,130
Swamiji, I'm not a child!
I've read yourface!

431
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,063
But, I couldn't make out...
What's the matter?

432
00:57:42,576 --> 00:57:44,544
I haven't seen your face like this before.

433
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:48,711
I'm an orphan!

434
00:57:50,584 --> 00:57:52,552
I've grownup after acceptlng this bitter truth!

435
00:57:54,287 --> 00:57:56,847
The one whom I made my life partner,
becarne partner of liquor!

436
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,852
I swallowed even this bitter truth like honey!

437
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:11,899
If fate has given me another bitterpoison then,
I have the guts & courage to drink even that!!

438
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:13,996
Tell me, Swamiji.

439
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,606
Which storm is hiding behind your silence?

440
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:25,712
Tell me... I'll face it.

441
00:58:26,486 --> 00:58:28,181
I've learnt to live dyingly!

442
00:58:29,222 --> 00:58:34,159
Swamiji, don't hesitate.
I have the power to tolerate it.

443
00:58:35,161 --> 00:58:35,923
Tell me...

444
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:46,062
You might be having power to listen but,
my tongue doesn't have power to speak!

445
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:54,477
Anyway, which is about to open tomorrow...
Let it be disclosed today itself!

446
00:58:57,517 --> 00:59:03,854
Doctor has diagnosed a dangerous allment!

447
00:59:11,064 --> 00:59:16,161
But, will this allment get better after treatment?

448
00:59:17,237 --> 00:59:21,936
It's a permanent ailment!

449
00:59:25,512 --> 00:59:28,504
When it comes, it takes you along.

450
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:37,954
You'll not live more than 23 months!!

451
00:59:39,959 --> 00:59:41,517
You have got blood cancer.

452
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:21,599
Don't leave them.

453
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:45,922
Deep, catch hold of it.

454
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:49,857
Deep get inside...
You all get inside.

455
01:00:55,668 --> 01:01:04,042
Tulsi, take these chicken & prepare Chicken chilly,
chicken fry, chicken masala & pasta too.

456
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:07,979
My friends have come for dinner!

457
01:01:08,648 --> 01:01:10,616
My son is saved!

458
01:01:11,885 --> 01:01:13,113
I'm very happy!

459
01:01:14,788 --> 01:01:16,050
Forme, chicken roast!

460
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:20,126
Forme, chicken curry!

01:01:20,126 --> 01:01:22,094
Forme, salad.
Salad?

462
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,722
Does salad is made out of chicken?
Yes, it can be made.

463
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,589
Make even salad.
Also make some 2/3 dishes.

464
01:01:27,867 --> 01:01:30,062
Intoxicatlon won't do in this house!

465
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:32,696
Make arrangement of dinner outside itself.

466
01:01:33,006 --> 01:01:33,870
What nonsense!

467
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:35,098
Hold this!

468
01:01:37,544 --> 01:01:41,640
Suraj, it seems sister in law is not in mood today.

469
01:01:41,881 --> 01:01:45,852
Forget it for today, we'll have dinner
some other day.

470
01:01:45,852 --> 01:01:48,719
There's no such thing.
Her mood is alright!

471
01:01:51,024 --> 01:01:56,860
I'll see it myself.
She listens to me.

472
01:01:58,765 --> 01:02:03,031
His wife isn't in his control.

473
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:06,833
Let's go somewhere else or
we'll not even get salad.

474
01:02:11,578 --> 01:02:13,443
Did a worm go into your braln?

475
01:02:15,582 --> 01:02:18,847
I invited my friends for dinner
& you insulted them?

476
01:02:21,921 --> 01:02:23,445
Why are you staring like this?

477
01:02:26,459 --> 01:02:28,086
Who is the owner of this house?

478
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,784
How did I come outside?

479
01:03:58,484 --> 01:04:00,918
I rai. Sed my hand on you
under the infiuence of alcohol...

480
01:04:01,688 --> 01:04:05,180
I'm not human but devil!
I swear on God!

481
01:04:10,663 --> 01:04:12,426
Tell me what shall I do?

482
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:22,472
I'm not crying because you beat me...

483
01:04:26,613 --> 01:04:31,983
I'm worried about our childrens.
What will happen to them?

484
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:44,753
If you keep on drinking this way...
I'm afrai. D our children don't get scattered!!

485
01:04:51,504 --> 01:04:52,630
Everything will be alright.

486
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:06,882
I don't have courage to tell you
but couldn't resist also.

487
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,048
What happen?

488
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,562
I don't really know...

489
01:05:19,899 --> 01:05:23,062
When we have not done
anything wrong to anybody...

490
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:27,470
Then, why did he ruin our fate?

491
01:05:28,975 --> 01:05:30,704
I don't unders. Tand what you are telling?

492
01:05:32,512 --> 01:05:36,846
Tulsi, I'm a bit scared!
What exactly are you trying to say?

493
01:05:46,993 --> 01:05:49,928
I'm soon leaving you all, forever!

494
01:05:55,935 --> 01:05:56,924
You will be going...

495
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:01,971
Will you go leaving us all?

496
01:06:03,076 --> 01:06:04,566
Will you go leaving me alone?

497
01:06:07,613 --> 01:06:10,639
Have you gone mad?
Do you?

498
01:06:12,618 --> 01:06:13,642
Where will you go?

499
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:26,560
That day in the hospital, when they
took my blood to tran. Smit to Deep...

500
01:06:39,746 --> 01:06:41,236
What are you telling?

501
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,948
Are you plating prank on me?
For I raised my hand on you.

502
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:52,851
You are lying. Aren't you?

503
01:06:55,695 --> 01:06:56,593
It's a fact!

504
01:07:34,033 --> 01:07:38,663
She is a goddess!
She worship your Gods!!

505
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:41,632
Not one but she worships every God!!

506
01:07:42,508 --> 01:07:44,840
Then, why she has to face so much paln?

507
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:50,240
What way is this... of your God?

508
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:52,879
Isn't this justice?

509
01:08:00,259 --> 01:08:02,022
If he was to give punishment...

510
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:03,560
He should have given me!
I'm alcoholic!

511
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:07,665
I have given paln to my wife
& childrens by drinking liquor!

512
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:11,031
He should have given this pain to me.
This allment!

513
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:15,039
But, even I haven't done anybody's wrong!

514
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:18,508
I earn myself & drink from my earnings.
And then sleep.

515
01:08:21,948 --> 01:08:24,439
If she will not be there...
What will happen to my childrens?

516
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:31,554
I'll not allow this to happen.

517
01:08:37,563 --> 01:08:40,054
Before doing anything to Tulsi,
he has to kill me!

518
01:08:40,499 --> 01:08:42,558
You better tell your God!

519
01:08:45,104 --> 01:08:48,870
I very well unders. Tand your paln.

520
01:08:51,677 --> 01:08:56,740
We both cannot do anything agalnst his wishes.

521
01:09:03,689 --> 01:09:08,683
You could do a favor forTulsi.
I can give my life for her!

522
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:10,989
Tell me what shall I do?

523
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:19,728
Now, whatever tlme is left with her...
Let her live in peace & harmony!!

524
01:09:21,641 --> 01:09:26,512
And you very well know,
from which act of yours...

525
01:09:26,512 --> 01:09:28,104
She'll achieve utmost peace!

526
01:09:34,253 --> 01:09:35,914
Tell me what you wish to say?

527
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:37,520
I have one desire...

528
01:09:38,524 --> 01:09:39,616
Will you fulfill it?

529
01:09:42,561 --> 01:09:43,084
Tell me...

530
01:09:44,497 --> 01:09:47,466
You do a second marriage!
What?

531
01:09:48,234 --> 01:09:50,566
What are you telling?
I'm rightly saying so...

532
01:09:52,972 --> 01:09:56,635
After I've gone, children shouldn't feel my absence.

533
01:09:58,077 --> 01:10:02,741
Our childrens should get the affectlon
which we both didn't get in our childhood.

534
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:06,017
Therefore, you bring anothermother for them.

535
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:19,954
How did you think that another woman
could give affectlon like you?

536
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:25,561
Nobody could render love like my Tulsi...

537
01:10:27,606 --> 01:10:30,507
One doesn't get live body
after ruhning behind shadows!!

538
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:36,103
You don't think that way...
Nothing will happen to you.

539
01:10:37,216 --> 01:10:40,083
I'm not afrai. D of dying but I regret that...

540
01:10:41,554 --> 01:10:43,146
I could not shower affectlon on my childrens!

541
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:47,819
One more thing...

542
01:10:49,028 --> 01:10:52,231
Childrens shouldn't come to know
about my allment.

543
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:54,222
Because while dying, I want to see them happy!

544
01:14:52,605 --> 01:14:53,902
These are your medicines.

545
01:14:56,675 --> 01:14:57,767
And this is yourmoney.

546
01:15:09,622 --> 01:15:10,646
What is it?

547
01:15:12,491 --> 01:15:13,082
Take your tempo away.

548
01:15:13,892 --> 01:15:15,189
And if I not get it away then?

549
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:19,092
Will you beat me again?

550
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:20,930
Forget it!

551
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:28,605
You've once beat me very much!

552
01:15:31,844 --> 01:15:36,804
I did ring bell of your son!
With this tempo itself.

553
01:15:39,051 --> 01:15:44,011
His fate was good that he survived!

554
01:15:52,531 --> 01:15:56,092
Look Vikrarn, whateveris past...
Forget it!

555
01:15:59,705 --> 01:16:03,539
I don't want to fight with anybody.
Is it alright?

556
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,134
I'm going. Okay?

557
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,062
I don't want to fight!

558
01:16:29,535 --> 01:16:30,229
Leave me...

559
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:35,097
You & your wife has given me
lot of pain & agony!!

560
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:38,632
Leave me...

561
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:45,608
Leave me...

562
01:16:48,921 --> 01:16:51,913
I'm telling you for the last time.
I don't want to fight!

563
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:31,094
If I wish, I can kill you right now!

564
01:17:32,765 --> 01:17:37,099
I'm sparing you only because you have a family!

565
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,989
No, Vikram!

566
01:18:13,038 --> 01:18:14,699
No, Vikram!

567
01:18:15,507 --> 01:18:17,065
You've come with a plan to kill me!!

568
01:18:18,877 --> 01:18:19,844
Don't do it.

569
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,650
My wife will survive for few days...

570
01:18:28,220 --> 01:18:31,656
My childrens will be orphaned!
Don't kill me!!

571
01:19:29,481 --> 01:19:31,813
What happen to you?

572
01:19:37,756 --> 01:19:39,155
Don't call the childrens.

573
01:19:40,492 --> 01:19:43,518
They will not be able to see me in this condition.

574
01:19:54,907 --> 01:19:58,035
I couldn't give you any happiness in life!

575
01:20:01,780 --> 01:20:03,509
I thought of giving it for some days...

576
01:20:06,652 --> 01:20:08,620
What did this happen?

577
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:14,616
I think your God listened to me.

578
01:20:16,595 --> 01:20:19,189
I'm going before you!

579
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:21,495
What sort of things are you saying?

580
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,633
Nothing will happen to you.

581
01:20:24,803 --> 01:20:26,634
You cannot leave us like this...

582
01:20:28,740 --> 01:20:30,731
Our childrens shouldn't be orphaned!!

583
01:20:31,677 --> 01:20:34,908
It's you who has to take of our childrens,
when I die!

584
01:20:36,481 --> 01:20:37,709
You promised me!

585
01:20:38,116 --> 01:20:40,482
You cannot break that promise!!

586
01:20:42,688 --> 01:20:44,212
Nothing will happen.

587
01:20:45,123 --> 01:20:46,613
Let's go to the hospital.

588
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:15,480
Thank you Mummy formaking
brinjal dish forme!

589
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:19,718
I had told you forpaneer curry & bread.
Did you prepare it, Mom?

590
01:22:19,718 --> 01:22:21,185
Yes, I've made.

591
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,114
If I'm not there, then who will cook
& feed you all these?

592
01:22:24,489 --> 01:22:25,979
Will you not live with us?

593
01:22:28,527 --> 01:22:32,691
I wish to live with you
but, I have to go!

594
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,826
Where will you go, Mom?

595
01:22:36,501 --> 01:22:38,025
I have never gone there before...

596
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:40,630
But, it's too far!

597
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:43,565
Mom, take us also...

598
01:22:45,010 --> 01:22:46,443
Don't talk such thing.

599
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:49,173
How will we live without you?

600
01:22:50,816 --> 01:22:54,547
You have to live, son!
It's the decision of fate!!

601
01:22:56,722 --> 01:23:02,558
I've found a very good job, far away!
I have to go.

602
01:23:03,628 --> 01:23:05,528
No, Mom. Don't go leaving us alone.

603
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:07,224
Don't talk such thing, dear.

604
01:23:07,933 --> 01:23:11,425
I'll be happy only when your life will be settled.

605
01:23:12,037 --> 01:23:14,733
Don't you want to give me happiness?
Yes, we do.

606
01:23:17,042 --> 01:23:19,840
So, do it as I say...

607
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:28,510
Before going there, I'll make your arrangements.

608
01:23:34,459 --> 01:23:38,828
I'll hand over one by one to good family!

609
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:54,475
You'll get good clothes, good food...
And very loving parents!!

610
01:23:56,715 --> 01:23:58,046
Everything will be there.

611
01:24:00,152 --> 01:24:02,882
Please give all of us in one house only.

612
01:24:05,857 --> 01:24:08,155
How could anyone take care
of 4 childrens in one house?

613
01:24:08,493 --> 01:24:09,755
You manage us...

614
01:24:11,429 --> 01:24:12,418
I arn your mother!

615
01:24:12,998 --> 01:24:16,798
But, Mom...
Give both of us in one house.

616
01:24:17,469 --> 01:24:19,903
Because Vijay always needs me.

617
01:24:20,972 --> 01:24:21,597
Sure, dear.

618
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:25,976
I'll give you both in one house only.

619
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:36,680
Please come, Doctor.

620
01:24:38,857 --> 01:24:41,621
Tulsi, I'd told you about a doctor.
Yes.

621
01:24:42,227 --> 01:24:48,530
He is Dr. Michael D' Souza &
his wife Dr. Anjali D' Souza

622
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:50,866
Please come.

623
01:24:55,607 --> 01:24:56,505
Please come.

624
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:13,624
Doctor, I'll be back soon.
Okay.

625
01:25:16,161 --> 01:25:19,764
Tulsi, show them the children.
They have to go!

626
01:25:19,764 --> 01:25:22,597
Rest of the formality...
We'll do it afterwards.

627
01:26:17,555 --> 01:26:20,456
Oh, baby!
What is your narne?

628
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:26,628
He is very cute!

629
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:29,233
You'll carry on the conversatlon,
I'll be back. Okay.

630
01:26:32,871 --> 01:26:35,601
Swamiji must have told you about us.

631
01:26:40,545 --> 01:26:43,571
Why are you crying?
What happened to you??

632
01:26:45,884 --> 01:26:48,478
We liked the baby very much!!
Okay.

633
01:26:49,688 --> 01:26:51,178
Tulsi, one minute...

634
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:56,559
If you want to ask anything...
You can ask.

635
01:26:58,697 --> 01:27:01,666
Tulsi has a small worry!

636
01:27:02,734 --> 01:27:04,099
So, you better ask me.

637
01:27:04,569 --> 01:27:06,696
I promise, I'll not feel bad for anything.

638
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:13,807
Today, you have no child.
What if tomorrow you have one then?

639
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,108
We both are doctors...

640
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:23,817
We've come to know aftermany tests
that no child could be born!

641
01:27:25,557 --> 01:27:28,025
Therefore, we consciously decided to adopt a child!

642
01:27:29,694 --> 01:27:34,961
And for your convenlence, I'm ready to
make my entlre property in his narne!!

643
01:27:38,903 --> 01:27:43,067
As it is, after I adopt this child...
He will be mine forever!!

644
01:27:46,544 --> 01:27:47,738
Do you have any objection?

645
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:13,636
Take this, doctor.

646
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,844
Chotu, what are you doing?
Are you playing??

647
01:28:25,483 --> 01:28:26,609
Look here, Chotu.
Play with us!

648
01:28:36,061 --> 01:28:36,823
No, mummy!!

649
01:31:00,505 --> 01:31:03,633
Will youjust go on eatlng...
Will you not pay attentlon towards me?

650
01:31:05,677 --> 01:31:09,514
Your name should have been Fakirchand (beggar)
Instead of Ameerchand (wealthy)

651
01:31:09,514 --> 01:31:12,617
Look Swami. You are my childhood friend.
Yes.

652
01:31:12,617 --> 01:31:16,109
You very well know, I don't like unnecessary expense!

653
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:21,416
Therefore, I'll adopt only one child
& save other child's money!

654
01:31:21,626 --> 01:31:24,993
What will I do by tying 2 children's
like a mufflerin my neck?

655
01:31:25,663 --> 01:31:27,096
And that too, a handicap!

656
01:31:28,633 --> 01:31:31,864
I'll better die but not take both of them.
You be seated.

657
01:31:33,705 --> 01:31:38,642
Look Swami, you are my friend
that's why I'm adopting a child!

658
01:31:40,111 --> 01:31:41,813
But, I don't know anything later.

659
01:31:41,813 --> 01:31:45,476
My wife doesn't like to take
even one child in her arms.

660
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:50,919
What happen, Swamiji?

661
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:52,888
It's a sad news for all of us.

662
01:31:54,492 --> 01:31:58,053
My friend isn't ready to adopt both the childs!

663
01:31:59,230 --> 01:32:02,722
But, they both are twins!!
It would be better if they live tgether.

664
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:04,860
Vijay will seek Deeps assistance.

665
01:32:05,570 --> 01:32:09,472
I know it. But, he refused.

666
01:32:10,441 --> 01:32:11,499
Any reason forit?

667
01:32:15,713 --> 01:32:17,908
He doesn't want to adopt a handicap child!

668
01:32:19,617 --> 01:32:20,641
You don't worry!

669
01:32:21,185 --> 01:32:24,621
We'll find somebody who could
embrace him affectlonately.

670
01:32:25,823 --> 01:32:30,851
Don't lose this opportunity.
If he is taking one child, let him take.

671
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:39,729
Tulsi, agree to what I'm saying.
As you wish.

672
01:32:57,755 --> 01:32:59,552
She is mother of these childrens.

673
01:33:03,127 --> 01:33:05,061
Dear, say good morning to uncle & aunty.

674
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:19,806
Come this way...

675
01:33:26,718 --> 01:33:31,553
Look, one seems to be calm!
But, is handicap of no use.

676
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:36,424
And the other seems to be very cunning!
He will cheat us in future!

677
01:33:37,061 --> 01:33:41,657
Therefore, I say to save money
& quietly get away from here.

678
01:33:42,633 --> 01:33:44,533
Will you remain qulet?

679
01:33:46,471 --> 01:33:47,904
Look how sad they are?

680
01:33:48,506 --> 01:33:51,998
But, why should I become sad
after taking their expenses

681
01:34:06,023 --> 01:34:06,648
Two?

682
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:10,455
Take this, dear.
Take it!

683
01:34:13,064 --> 01:34:14,053
Even you take this.

684
01:34:16,467 --> 01:34:17,957
How pretty these childrens are?

685
01:34:29,046 --> 01:34:30,445
Why did you give sweets to both of them?

686
01:34:30,982 --> 01:34:33,618
You should give only to the one
whom we have chosen.

687
01:34:33,618 --> 01:34:35,415
Or else both will come together.

688
01:34:36,020 --> 01:34:38,079
And my pocket will tear!

689
01:34:38,523 --> 01:34:40,923
You are always like this.
Now, let's go!

690
01:34:44,529 --> 01:34:48,065
Don't keep that in my bag.
It's your school uniform.

691
01:34:48,065 --> 01:34:50,533
The school uniform there will be different.
Isn't it?

692
01:34:51,502 --> 01:34:54,198
Deep, when you'll come back?
What do I know?

693
01:35:01,946 --> 01:35:06,508
My good son!
Be good there also...

694
01:35:07,084 --> 01:35:10,542
Don't fight with anybody.
Where do I get tlme to fight?

695
01:35:10,922 --> 01:35:11,479
Why, dear?

696
01:35:11,722 --> 01:35:15,123
The whole day will pass thinking of you!!

697
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:40,674
You go ahead, I'll bring it.

698
01:35:53,731 --> 01:35:58,998
Hurry up! If it's late in the evenlng.
Then, we have to switch on the head light!

699
01:36:00,137 --> 01:36:01,934
The guarantee of bulb will expire.

700
01:36:03,074 --> 01:36:04,701
Come on, hurry up!

701
01:36:07,979 --> 01:36:11,642
How do I bid farewell to you?
I don't know?

702
01:36:12,116 --> 01:36:14,710
When you will understand...
Make her understand as well.

703
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:15,676
Now, let's go!

704
01:36:18,489 --> 01:36:23,517
Tulsi sister, we have to go now.

705
01:36:25,930 --> 01:36:31,994
Whenever women talk to each other,
it seems dally soaps have started.

706
01:36:51,556 --> 01:36:53,251
They are going on hugging each other.

707
01:36:55,693 --> 01:36:56,591
Hurry up!

708
01:37:16,948 --> 01:37:19,610
What's going on?
Now, let's go!

709
01:38:24,915 --> 01:38:29,011
What are you thinking, Vijay?
When are you going, sister?

710
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:29,953
Where?

711
01:38:30,521 --> 01:38:34,651
Kust like Chotu & Deep went away!!
When are you going?

712
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:40,924
Mom was telling that somebody is coming
to take you as well.

713
01:38:41,732 --> 01:38:43,461
I will not go anywhere...

714
01:38:48,706 --> 01:38:53,166
I will not go anywhere leaving you both.

715
01:38:54,545 --> 01:38:58,572
His conversatlon is like the web of a spider!
Anybody could be trapped!

716
01:38:59,050 --> 01:39:01,883
Talk only that what you've come for...

717
01:39:02,153 --> 01:39:04,553
Why are you tra. Pped between spider & flies!!

718
01:39:06,991 --> 01:39:15,899
Look, we had a strong desire for a girl!
We thought of naming her 'Arzoo'

719
01:39:17,134 --> 01:39:19,864
But, she didn't allow me to fulfill my desire.

720
01:39:21,105 --> 01:39:21,901
Be qulet!

721
01:39:23,474 --> 01:39:24,964
I had 3 son's

722
01:39:25,943 --> 01:39:29,470
The elder son died in a plane crash!

723
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:32,448
The 2nd one is in America.

724
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:34,480
And the 3rd is settled in Canada.

725
01:39:35,252 --> 01:39:41,521
But, neither they are interested in property
nor in their old parents!!

726
01:39:42,626 --> 01:39:43,490
Forget it!

727
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:46,993
Now, we will not go to moon
for such petty things.

728
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:52,533
We are born at this land & we desire
to even get bury in this land itself.

729
01:39:54,672 --> 01:39:56,640
We want support in this age!

730
01:39:57,241 --> 01:39:59,539
A daughter to take care of us!

731
01:40:00,644 --> 01:40:03,841
Tell me, when are you sending
your daughter to us?

732
01:40:08,652 --> 01:40:11,519
Look, you don't worry!

733
01:40:12,456 --> 01:40:17,860
When the tlme comes, I'll take the responsibility
of marrying her to a well to do family!

734
01:40:18,629 --> 01:40:21,029
This is a promise from both of us!!

735
01:40:22,032 --> 01:40:25,490
Till then, we'll keep herin utmost comfort!

736
01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:31,742
Because tlll now our affectlon for children
hasn't diminlshed yet.

737
01:40:31,742 --> 01:40:33,642
Even my affectlon is stlll alive!

738
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:41,617
We will quench her thirst for affectlon
by giving her loads of love!

739
01:40:42,653 --> 01:40:43,517
Call the girl!

740
01:41:01,038 --> 01:41:02,699
My daughteris a piece of a moon!!

741
01:41:03,574 --> 01:41:05,565
We'll take hernext full moon day!

742
01:41:07,111 --> 01:41:10,444
The feeling of our Ioneliness is now over!

743
01:41:16,921 --> 01:41:18,582
God Bless you.

744
01:41:19,056 --> 01:41:19,579
Let's go!

745
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:20,649
Okay, dear!

746
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:29,193
We'll leave...

747
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:44,640
I'll not go anywhere...

748
01:41:45,850 --> 01:41:47,215
I'll stay here only.

749
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:50,586
Here? Till when

750
01:41:50,821 --> 01:41:53,483
Till you are here, I'll stay with you.

751
01:41:54,491 --> 01:41:57,551
And with my brother after you leave!

752
01:42:00,731 --> 01:42:02,528
But, I'll stay here itself.

753
01:42:03,667 --> 01:42:08,070
Please Mom, don't refuse!!
Please!

754
01:42:21,585 --> 01:42:25,419
You are very intelligent daughter of your mother!

755
01:42:26,023 --> 01:42:29,959
If you don't listen to her then, who will?

756
01:42:30,594 --> 01:42:34,894
How can I leave her alone
inspite of knowing her allment?

757
01:42:35,733 --> 01:42:40,500
Swamiji, don't send me anywhere.
Because I'm not going anywhere.

758
01:42:41,906 --> 01:42:44,898
If I go away... then who will
take care of my mother?

759
01:42:45,509 --> 01:42:47,204
You don't worry about it!

760
01:42:48,712 --> 01:42:52,249
Kust listen to your mother.
But...

761
01:42:52,249 --> 01:42:56,515
Let me live with her, tlll she goes.

762
01:42:57,121 --> 01:43:01,114
Dear, tlme is very less!

763
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:11,590
Your mother shall attain this satlsfactlon that
she has sent all of you to good families!!

764
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:13,764
It's not that way, Swamiji.

765
01:43:18,475 --> 01:43:20,966
Look, we'll take care of your mother.

766
01:43:21,712 --> 01:43:24,408
There's no need for you to worry!

767
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:26,811
Be happy!

768
01:43:43,701 --> 01:43:44,633
Come, dear!

769
01:44:24,775 --> 01:44:26,037
Vijay, dear...

770
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:29,574
Mom!

771
01:44:47,231 --> 01:44:49,426
What happen, Mom?
Get the medicine.

772
01:45:51,662 --> 01:45:53,493
Now, there's no need for you to come agaln.

773
01:45:55,165 --> 01:45:59,158
Did you understand?
Yes, I do.

774
01:46:00,938 --> 01:46:04,601
Now, coming here will not stop me
from going there...

775
01:46:31,568 --> 01:46:38,633
Is it a good luck of mine to be born handicap?
What are you talking?

776
01:46:39,176 --> 01:46:44,637
If I would have been fit like my brother & sister...
Then somebody might take me as well.

777
01:46:44,948 --> 01:46:48,543
I'm handicap! That's why I'm still with you.

778
01:46:49,853 --> 01:46:52,253
This is my good luck itself.
Isn't it, Mom?

779
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:08,968
Dear Isha...
My blessings are always with you!

780
01:47:10,541 --> 01:47:12,031
You always remaln happy!

781
01:47:13,477 --> 01:47:14,535
I went to the doctor.

782
01:47:15,646 --> 01:47:20,549
He said that there's no need
for any further treatment.

783
01:47:22,553 --> 01:47:24,680
We'll meet in this Diwali at our home.

784
01:47:25,756 --> 01:47:29,453
I'll make food from my own hands
& feed you all.

785
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:33,053
This is my last wish!
And even my happiness!!

786
01:47:34,831 --> 01:47:38,824
I'm very tensed thinking about Vijay!

787
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:41,631
What will happen to him?

788
01:47:42,139 --> 01:47:46,542
Nobody carne to adopt this handicap child!

789
01:47:47,277 --> 01:47:50,735
To invite you for Diwali...
Vijay & myself will come in person.

790
01:47:52,082 --> 01:47:54,243
I'll give you the address of Deep & Chotu.

791
01:47:54,785 --> 01:47:57,686
Because after I go away...
You are their mother!!

792
01:53:05,695 --> 01:53:09,859
Mother! Mother!!
Mother! Mother!!

793
01:54:51,901 --> 01:54:54,062
You gave me this deadly allment!

794
01:54:56,506 --> 01:54:57,700
I did accept it!

795
01:54:59,542 --> 01:55:05,503
When I started gettlng happiness from husband...
You snatched him suddenly!

796
01:55:08,018 --> 01:55:10,213
I considered it to be my fate!

797
01:55:11,921 --> 01:55:16,517
You separated my children's with my own hands!!

798
01:55:17,661 --> 01:55:19,856
I tolerated even this!

799
01:55:20,697 --> 01:55:23,860
Neither did I complain nor did I ask for something...

800
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:26,935
But, I'm asking today!

801
01:55:28,538 --> 01:55:30,028
Give me life for one nlght!

802
01:55:32,876 --> 01:55:35,709
I want to see my childrens for the last time!!

803
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:39,672
Hey Sal, do favor on me!!

804
01:55:46,756 --> 01:55:48,951
Hey Kesus, have pity on me!!

805
01:55:54,564 --> 01:55:57,124
Hey Allah, have mercy on me!!

806
02:00:20,496 --> 02:00:21,622
Don't cry!
Come...

807
02:00:28,471 --> 02:00:29,495
Sister...

808
02:00:30,473 --> 02:00:31,531
Sister...

809
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:39,799
Don't cry, dear!

810
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:34,414
Son...

811
02:04:06,122 --> 02:04:07,646
We have come to take you!!

812
02:04:38,988 --> 02:04:40,615
Great!!
Swami...
