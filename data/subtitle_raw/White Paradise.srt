1
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:46,808
FRANCE

2
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:49,234
Police!
Everybody on the floor!

3
00:02:53,701 --> 00:02:55,835
All to stay
in their places.

4
00:03:15,744 --> 00:03:17,744
These are the cops.

5
00:03:22,742 --> 00:03:24,742
Stop!

6
00:04:40,992 --> 00:04:47,092
CELEBRATE

7
00:05:29,966 --> 00:05:32,883
Take as needed
painkillers.

8
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:35,433
And a cold compress,
if you're in a lot of pain.

9
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,225
You need to keep track
and your weight.

10
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,416
Important.

11
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:47,517
That's it.
I'll see you on Monday, right?

12
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,250
Is everything okay?

13
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,317
I would like
to extend my sick leave.

14
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,958
We have already extended it
last month, Samuel.

15
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,125
It is all up to you.

16
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,125
Okay, we'll see
next week.

17
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:10,083
Is it possible or not?
- We did a good job.

18
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,375
The important thing is not to
strain too much, right?

19
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,592
Play.
- Let's go, Leah.

20
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,708
Is everything okay?
- Is she well?

21
00:06:46,858 --> 00:06:49,375
Yes, we were painting.
Right, Leah?

22
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:53,408
Come on, Leah, let's go.
- Wait for me to draw.

23
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,316
You will draw it at home.
Let's go.

24
00:06:58,958 --> 00:07:03,208
Leah?
Let's go, I said.

25
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:06,775
Leah, your father is waiting for you.
Come on, let's go.

26
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,458
See you soon.

27
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,250
Merci.
- Have a nice day.

28
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,750
Merci.

29
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,125
Bon Appetit.

30
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,041
Was it nice at the pool?

31
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,791
Yeah.

32
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:11,125
I told you not to come in
in my room.

33
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,791
Why did you come in again?

34
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,591
Don't touch my stuff.

35
00:08:18,908 --> 00:08:21,416
I told you not to touch them.
Don't touch them.

36
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:33,166
This is not yours.

37
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:36,375
But it's not yours either.

38
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,291
Cedric, can you open up?

39
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:19,175
Hi.
- Hi.

40
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,666
Say hello to Uncle Cedric?
- Hello, Uncle.

41
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,833
Hi, honey.

42
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,750
Inside it is complete chaos.

43
00:09:28,416 --> 00:09:30,416
Go to your cousins.

44
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,333
Did something happen?

45
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,458
Can I leave it with you
for the weekend?

46
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,833
What's going on?

47
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,708
I will go to the hut.

48
00:09:44,833 --> 00:09:47,375
Wait, I'll come with you.
- No.

49
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,041
No, everything is fine.

50
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:53,392
Not a good idea
to go there alone.

51
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:56,166
I need it.

52
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:01,433
You... you can't
wait just a little?

53
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:04,708
Now I have time.
- On Monday you're at work.

54
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,166
I'm on sick leave.
- What are you talking about, Samuel...

55
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,283
Can you watch it or not?

56
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,250
Did he talk to her?

57
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,875
I'm just asking you
whether you can or not.

58
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,875
Okay.

59
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,208
Merci.

60
00:10:36,375 --> 00:10:38,375
Can you give her that?

61
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,100
Will you call
when you arrive?

62
00:12:11,425 --> 00:12:12,933
Gendarmerie, good day.

63
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,750
Ladies and gentlemen,
check the documents.

64
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:25,000
Monsieur, may I see
your papers?

65
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,333
Hey, where did you go?

66
00:12:41,708 --> 00:12:43,708
Where are you travelling to?

67
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,375
For Italy.
- Boss?

68
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:53,541
Welcome.
I'm coming.

69
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,708
Give me your hand!

70
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,583
Samuel, what a surprise.

71
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,750
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

72
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,168
Hello, Stefano.
- Victor and Justine, my friends.

73
00:14:11,471 --> 00:14:14,291
They are French like you.
- Hello.

74
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:21,208
Is that your dog?
- Yes, it's mine. German Shepherd.

75
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,550
We hunt together.

76
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:26,676
My dad and I do hunting trips,
you know?

77
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,866
No, I didn't.

78
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:33,375
With all this going on...
business is going badly.

79
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:35,975
He wants to leave,
but I'm staying.

80
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,125
On the other hand...

81
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:41,833
this is our home.
- Yes.

82
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,583
Come a little closer.

83
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,800
My father asked me
to tell you that...

84
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:54,891
very sorry about your wife.
- It's all right, merci.

85
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,791
Give my regards to your father from me.

86
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,958
Of course.
- Goodbye.

87
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:24,125
I was cold.

88
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,125
France?

89
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:46,791
No, there is Italy.
France is not there.

90
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:52,750
Do you know the mountains?

91
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:57,208
Will you show me?

92
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:06,000
I have 300.
300, I can't give you more.

93
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,791
I don't need money.
I don't want trouble.

94
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,208
How much?

95
00:26:13,041 --> 00:26:16,241
You came to the mountain alone
in jeans and sneakers?

96
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:28,125
Wait.

97
00:26:29,833 --> 00:26:31,833
Wait.

98
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,333
Get it.

99
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:49,125
Get them.

100
00:26:57,458 --> 00:26:59,458
I'll show you.

101
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:01,458
Where are you going?

102
00:28:02,541 --> 00:28:04,541
To the border.

103
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,708
Yes, and then?

104
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:12,750
Brianson.
- You're all going to Brianson.

105
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,583
Was that the police?

106
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,583
Why don't you answer me?

107
00:29:29,833 --> 00:29:33,541
After the forest
you're gonna go on by yourself, okay?

108
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:21,083
Hi.
- Good day.

109
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Is everything okay?

110
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,250
Yeah, what about you?

111
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,725
Are you walking?

112
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:31,942
I walk, yes.
- There are a lot of refugees in the area.

113
00:31:32,241 --> 00:31:35,041
The Franco-Italian
border.

114
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,416
Will you come down and look around?

115
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:57,125
Where are you going?

116
00:31:57,666 --> 00:32:00,100
Back home...
but I'm going around from here.

117
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:03,666
Do you still live here?
I thought you left already.

118
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:06,125
What do you care?

119
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,500
I'm curious.

120
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:15,333
Where is she?
- Please?

121
00:32:15,587 --> 00:32:20,125
Your girlfriend, where is she?
- Why are you smiling?

122
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:23,871
Did you not understand what I asked you?
- I'm walking, okay.

123
00:32:24,021 --> 00:32:27,975
And you're out of breath.
- Now I understand why you came back.

124
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:30,392
Do you think,
that you'll help her?

125
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Hey, I'm talking to you.

126
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:38,183
What will the cops say?
- Don't you have another job?

127
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:40,933
Do you know how many years they give
to traffickers?

128
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,217
We have filmed everything.

129
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,958
Enough.
- No, you will stay here.

130
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:50,325
You probably don't understand
what's going on.

131
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:55,250
This is our home, Samuel.
Do you know how many there are?

132
00:32:55,416 --> 00:32:57,483
Are you going to translate them all?

133
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,250
Stefano told me everything.

134
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:14,375
About the unfortunate case.

135
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You drove...

136
00:33:19,208 --> 00:33:22,142
You replaced it very quickly.

137
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,875
There is nothing.
It's not there.

138
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:38,708
She crossed.
- It's probably around here somewhere.

139
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:41,409
Have a nice walk, Samuel.

140
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,791
Who were these people?

141
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:57,958
We will go through the high.

142
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,250
You should not stay here.

143
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:05,208
Have you ever done that?
- They can come back, come on.

144
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,583
I used to do it before
every summer and I know.

145
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,417
If they come back they will take you away,
do you understand?

146
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:15,259
You should not stay here,
come on.

147
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,333
If we climb higher
we won't meet anyone.

148
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,375
Come on!

149
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:32,916
Anyone?

150
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,750
No!

151
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:24,458
Don't.

152
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:27,333
Don't.

153
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:31,166
No.

154
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,458
Listen to me, listen to me.

155
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:37,250
Listen to me.

156
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:39,458
Listen...

157
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,708
Trust me.

158
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,000
Easy, easy.

159
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,166
Relax.

160
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:39,750
My name is Chehre.

161
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:44,791
Samuel.

162
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Where did you learn French?

163
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,625
From my husband.

164
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,125
Ali.

165
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:08,083
He was...
translator in Kabul.

166
00:48:10,458 --> 00:48:14,291
We worked with the French military,
until they left.

167
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:20,333
In Greece we were separated.

168
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Why did you leave?

169
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:32,708
Because of the Taliban.

170
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:35,625
To them we are traitors.

171
00:48:42,791 --> 00:48:45,125
They attacked our school,

172
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:47,291
but we managed to escape.

173
00:48:49,875 --> 00:48:51,875
I am a teacher.

174
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,791
Do you have a family?

175
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,250
I have a daughter.
Her name is Lea.

176
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:22,125
Why are you doing this for me?

177
00:49:23,791 --> 00:49:25,791
You walk with me.

178
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:29,625
Because you need help.

179
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:30,558
Hi, I am.

180
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:33,583
I'm a little worried
about you, frankly.

181
00:50:34,416 --> 00:50:36,416
Lea is fine.

182
00:50:36,751 --> 00:50:40,266
You should know, Samuel,
that she needs you.

183
00:50:40,416 --> 00:50:43,416
Come here, Lea.
Do you want to say something to Daddy?

184
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,666
No, I don't.
Felix, wait!

185
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:50,266
Lea wanted to say hello,
but...

186
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:58,883
The main thing is to call me,
when you get a chance...

187
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:30,875
Search!

188
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:33,375
Stefano?
- Fuck him!

189
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:42,000
Search!
- Why didn't he tell us he was translating them?

190
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,750
These things are theirs, aren't they?

191
00:51:52,166 --> 00:51:54,166
Right?
- Yeah, I do.

192
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,875
Come on, Lee.
- Last touch.

193
00:52:20,708 --> 00:52:23,250
One, two... three.

194
00:52:27,958 --> 00:52:29,958
Stefano!

195
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:45,541
Oh my, what beauty.

196
00:52:47,791 --> 00:52:50,325
Burn this garbage.

197
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,500
Victor, this way.

198
00:52:53,166 --> 00:52:55,166
Come and see.

199
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,291
Let's go inside.

200
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,125
Justin.

201
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:25,250
Wait, damn it!
It's a trap.

202
00:54:32,833 --> 00:54:34,833
Samuel!

203
00:55:09,458 --> 00:55:11,458
Samuel!

204
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,750
Sorry.

205
00:55:57,708 --> 00:55:59,708
Sorry.

206
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:06,750
Forgive me.

207
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:28,083
When with Ali
we got lost in Greece...

208
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,250
I looked everywhere for it.

209
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
In all camps.

210
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:37,666
I kept looking for it
for a long time.

211
01:02:38,416 --> 01:02:40,416
Then...

212
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:42,625
then I left.

213
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:04,958
These are the keys
of our house.

214
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:08,583
So she is always with me.

215
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:25,125
And if he's not in Brianson
what will you do?

216
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:30,125
I will continue.

217
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:36,625
And you?

218
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:28,791
Chehre?

219
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:32,166
Chehre?

220
01:06:48,333 --> 01:06:50,333
Chehre?

221
01:06:52,708 --> 01:06:54,708
They are here.

222
01:07:22,166 --> 01:07:24,166
Come here.

223
01:07:49,125 --> 01:07:52,958
Come here, son of a bitch!
Where are you going, trash?

224
01:08:50,333 --> 01:08:52,333
I'm going this way.

225
01:08:53,284 --> 01:08:55,284
I go upstairs.

226
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:31,833
Victor?

227
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Victor?

228
01:09:40,791 --> 01:09:43,083
Oh, motherfucker!
Victor!

229
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:46,983
This asshole...
look what he did.

230
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:50,891
Where are you going, they are down there.
They're down there, I told you!

231
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:58,375
Samuel!

232
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:48,000
Stefano!

233
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:50,291
Damn,
tell me where they are.

234
01:12:06,083 --> 01:12:08,083
Victor, damn it!

235
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,958
Victor, he's slipping away.

236
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:29,208
Stop!

237
01:12:31,833 --> 01:12:33,958
Stop, I said!

238
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:44,500
Turn around!

239
01:12:50,416 --> 01:12:52,416
Turn around!

240
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,442
What the hell,
did, huh?

241
01:13:03,375 --> 01:13:05,375
What did you do?

242
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,250
There you are!

243
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:15,375
Will you tell me?

244
01:13:15,634 --> 01:13:18,208
Did you translate it?
Did you, eh?

245
01:13:19,416 --> 01:13:21,416
What's that, huh?

246
01:13:22,083 --> 01:13:24,083
Is it from my dog?

247
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:28,375
Who did it?
Did she kill him, huh?

248
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:37,000
Where is she?

249
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:39,416
Where is she?

250
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,166
Where the hell is she?

251
01:13:43,458 --> 01:13:45,458
Where's your bitch?

252
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,791
Get out!

253
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Where is she?

254
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,125
Where the hell is she?

255
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:07,625
She's gone.

256
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:12,916
She's gone.

257
01:14:26,833 --> 01:14:29,625
Justine, stop!
Don't shoot!

258
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:33,500
It doesn't.
Don't shoot.

259
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:35,666
Listen to me.

260
01:14:35,916 --> 01:14:38,458
It doesn't.
Listen...

261
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:42,025
We will not go to jail
for a Frenchman, are we?

262
01:14:42,291 --> 01:14:46,416
Let's disappear.
Leave it.

263
01:14:48,916 --> 01:14:50,916
Leave it.

264
01:14:55,916 --> 01:14:59,000
Now you will die alone here,
son of a bitch.

265
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:46,500
Samuel?

266
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:49,250
Samuel?

267
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:54,875
Samuel!

268
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:00,458
Samuel!

269
01:17:02,833 --> 01:17:04,833
Please.

270
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Please...

271
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:23,750
Help!

272
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
Stop!

273
01:18:01,291 --> 01:18:03,666
Do you hear me, Monsieur?
Do you hear me?

274
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:07,041
Are his eyes open?
- No.

275
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:11,083
Stay with us, Monsieur.
Stay with us.

276
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:17,375
Merci.

277
01:18:24,541 --> 01:18:27,041
Follow
not to close his eyes.

278
01:18:29,916 --> 01:18:32,500
You are not the first,
that I take.

279
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:52,750
What the hell are they doing here?
Fuck him!

280
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:56,250
We must pass.
- We can't.

281
01:18:56,916 --> 01:19:00,666
Do you have any documents in your possession?
Do you have documents?

282
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:30,141
Good evening.
- Start the engine.

283
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:32,291
Good evening, madam.

284
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:40,491
We need to get him
to the emergency room.

285
01:19:48,266 --> 01:19:51,733
What happened to you?
- There was an accident while walking.

286
01:19:52,024 --> 01:19:54,166
Monsieur, can you hear me?

287
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:56,416
What happened?

288
01:19:57,375 --> 01:20:00,041
He fell.
- We must pass.

289
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:02,475
Already lost a lot of blood.

290
01:20:02,625 --> 01:20:04,825
Can I see
your documents?

291
01:20:43,458 --> 01:20:45,458
Do you know where
to take him?

292
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,916
Hurry up.
- Thank you very much.

293
01:22:55,291 --> 01:22:58,825
When was the last time you ate?
- Last night.

294
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:02,041
Then you can
have something to eat.

295
01:23:02,708 --> 01:23:05,041
Your condition is stable.

296
01:23:05,208 --> 01:23:08,766
You've lost a little sensitivity,
but it'll come back.

297
01:23:10,125 --> 01:23:13,225
Can you put
your feet on the stool?

298
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,375
Merci.

299
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Ah, did you wake up?

300
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:24,458
Are you better?
How do you feel?

301
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,916
How is your hand?
Is it better?

302
01:23:30,041 --> 01:23:32,666
I'll give you a crutch.

303
01:23:34,416 --> 01:23:36,416
Welcome.

304
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:41,125
Where am I?
- At Gregoire's.

305
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,583
Near Brianson.

306
01:23:44,333 --> 01:23:46,708
We accept refugees.

307
01:24:28,083 --> 01:24:30,083
Samuel?

308
01:24:31,958 --> 01:24:33,958
I am Gregoire.

309
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:39,525
How are you?
Did you see the nurse?

310
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:43,250
There was a woman with me.

311
01:24:43,833 --> 01:24:45,833
Chehre, yeah.

312
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:53,252
I know you wanted
to say goodbye to you,

313
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:55,750
but we managed to get her
on the train.

314
01:24:55,916 --> 01:24:58,008
This morning set off
with a group

315
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:00,358
and now you must
be in Paris.

316
01:25:05,791 --> 01:25:08,858
We took advantage
of the opportunity...

317
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:21,541
Was she okay?
- Yes.

318
01:25:22,333 --> 01:25:24,333
And left.

319
01:25:25,416 --> 01:25:27,416
It was better than you.

320
01:25:33,791 --> 01:25:35,791
Will you stay for lunch
with us?

321
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:36,166
Yes, I'm fine.

322
01:26:36,666 --> 01:26:38,666
Excuse me for...

323
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,884
Can you come
to pick me up?

324
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,125
I will come.
Send me the address.

325
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:49,825
I will try to come
as quickly as possible.

326
01:26:52,083 --> 01:26:54,083
And Leah?

327
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:58,791
Is she there?
- Yes, I give it to you.

328
01:27:06,375 --> 01:27:08,375
Hello?

329
01:27:15,875 --> 01:27:17,875
Hey, Dad?

330
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:23,083
Hi, honey.

331
01:27:23,541 --> 01:27:25,541
How are you?

332
01:27:26,416 --> 01:27:28,416
When are you coming back?

333
01:27:30,875 --> 01:27:34,916
Your uncle will come and get me
and we'll sleep in tonight.

334
01:27:35,791 --> 01:27:37,791
They were gone a long time.

335
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,750
I know, yeah.

336
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:45,166
Are you okay?

337
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:48,166
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

338
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:51,666
I think about my mom a lot.

339
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:06,791
I miss her too, but
she'll always be with us... always.

340
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:09,641
Something happened yesterday
very funny.

341
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:13,583
With Leon and Felix we set off
for a walk

342
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:18,833
and we pushed all the buttons
on the elevator, and it got stuck.

343
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,125
The neighbor smoked like a fish.

344
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:25,958
Uncle Cedric scolded us.

345
01:28:30,791 --> 01:28:33,125
I'm glad you'll be back.

346
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:36,583
I love you.

347
01:28:37,375 --> 01:28:39,375
And I love you.
