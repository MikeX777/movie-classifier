1
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:14,560
(soft instrumental music)

2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,470
A musician's music

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:20,330
is only what it is, music.

4
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,040
Some is sad.

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,183
Some is happy.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,660
Some is fast.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,843
Some is slow.

8
00:00:32,603 --> 00:00:36,020
(avant-garde jazz music)

9
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,730
If you think of jazz as,

10
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:29,193
let me begin with way back.

11
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,940
You have one guy on a porch,

12
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,930
singing the blues, he's by himself.

13
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,520
So the blues chorus can be 12 bars.

14
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,780
It can be 13, it could be 14 and a half.

15
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,020
It could be nine.

16
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,980
It's whatever he's doing,

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,163
but add a bass player.

18
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,533
Now you have to have an agreement between the two of you.

19
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:54,740
And this becomes more and more obviously necessary

20
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,270
as you add other musicians,

21
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,640
and suddenly you have a big band,

22
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,540
and everything is scored and composed.

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,500
What the avant-garde began to do,

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,660
is to go back the other way and say,

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,400
you know, we have really mastered this music.

26
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,850
We understand how to talk to each other.

27
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,150
Now let's take away some of those agreements,

28
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,850
and see, can we still talk to each other?

29
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:20,793
Can we really improvise freely?

30
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,180
They're not saying that we don't like the past.

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,850
They're not saying that we're better than the past.

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,103
They're saying that this is another way to hear music.

33
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,193
(crowd cheering)

34
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:36,771
This is what I would love to have in my music, presence.

35
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:46,970
You know, as long as I can live, I mean,

36
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,280
I don't care about nothing I played yesterday,

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,820
if I can go home right now and write some music,

38
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,690
that is a presence, you know.

39
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:57,260
That's why they have machines, you know?

40
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,780
So you can, if you want the past,

41
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,820
there's a machine that's got the past,

42
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:04,080
right there, you know,

43
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,680
and which I think is very good, you know?

44
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,760
So therefore that means we as human beings

45
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,860
can be in the present.

46
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,963
Every movement in jazz reflects its time.

47
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,040
And one of the ironies of jazz in the 20th century,

48
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,950
because it moved so quickly

49
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,450
is that you were brought up in one era,

50
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,660
but you played something else.

51
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
You were brought up listening, loving swing,

52
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,920
a listening to Duke Ellington,

53
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,610
but you ended up playing Charlie Parker's music.

54
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,743
One, two, three, four.

55
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:39,183
Bebop, you see, wow.

56
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,363
Bebop had an urgency.

57
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:46,550
It had a kind of arrogance.

58
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:47,530
There was no way you could get by,

59
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,770
by being a narrow player and just play ensemble, you know.

60
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,680
If you were in a bebop band you were a soloist.

61
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,790
See, the swing bands on the records,

62
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,190
you don't have these lengthy solos.

63
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,143
With the boppers, you got a chance to hear Charlie Parker.

64
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,360
I saw him when I was just a kid.

65
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,643
That was 1949,

66
00:05:19,792 --> 00:05:21,590
but I never will forget it.

67
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,130
And I was amazed at how this human being, one man,

68
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:30,320
can stand up there looking like a saint and an angel,

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,800
in a white suit, playing all this beautiful music, man.

70
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,143
It changed my whole life.

71
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,813
Charlie Parker looked like Buddha.

72
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,110
Charlie Parker, who recently died,

73
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,023
laughing at a juggler on TV,

74
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,993
after weeks of strain and sickness,

75
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,830
was called a perfect musician.

76
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,933
Charlie Parker, pray for me.

77
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,103
Pray for me and everybody.

78
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,550
Charlie, did you realize at that time,

79
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,423
what effect you were going to have on jazz?

80
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,410
Well, I mean,

81
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,740
ever since I've ever heard music,

82
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,126
I thought it should be very clean, very precise.

83
00:06:18,126 --> 00:06:20,390
I mean, of course it could stand much improvement.

84
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,900
Most likely in another 25 or maybe 50 years,

85
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,650
some youngster will come along and take the style

86
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,750
and really do something with it, you know?

87
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,100
Just imagine what it'd be like

88
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,380
to be in New York in 1959

89
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,410
in the wake of the death of Charlie Parker,

90
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,810
who's still alive then in everybody's heads,

91
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,180
as Miles Davis doing what he's doing,

92
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,690
you come to town and say, well,

93
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:48,103
now all of that's really wonderful, but what about this?

94
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,200
Ornette was creating notes

95
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,913
that had not previously existed.

96
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,417
Ornette comes in,

97
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,317
the first thing he does is breaks a standing rule in jazz.

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,730
People don't want to give Ornette Coleman credit for this,

99
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,540
but I don't have any problems with it.

100
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,320
I'm sure there may have been some people historically,

101
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,440
who at one point said, well,

102
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,590
maybe you could improvise without following any chords,

103
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:28,920
but in my mind Ornette Coleman is the first guy

104
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,053
to make it work.

105
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,700
Many people would have been discouraged,

106
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,690
'cause he got a lot of the abuse from musicians around town

107
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,460
who really didn't get where he was coming from.

108
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,264
There's one occasion where he was playing with some guys,

109
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:54,500
and while he had his eyes closed playing,

110
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,090
they all got up and walked off the stage.

111
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,360
One musician after the other left the stage.

112
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,260
Ornette was left alone.

113
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,970
Then the waiter came up and said, Mister Coleman,

114
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,930
somebody wants to talk to you.

115
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,510
He walked out the door and they took his saxophone,

116
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,850
threw it down the mountain.

117
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,963
It was on a hill,

118
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,480
and beat him up.

119
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,840
His lung collapsed.

120
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,020
He had to go to the hospital.

121
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:26,120
That's when I started trying to not worry

122
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,080
about whether what I was doing had any value,

123
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,053
or whether it was good or bad, but to do it.

124
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,920
Whatever Ornette was doing, it worked.

125
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,053
I was converted.

126
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,540
You know, just conversion,

127
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,760
instant conversion,

128
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,120
and instant adoration.

129
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,360
It was like a religion.

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,830
I can't imagine how to describe it,

131
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,973
how to compare it to anything.

132
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,160
The thing that Ornette Coleman was doing with pitch,

133
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,280
that a lot of people just weren't getting,

134
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,380
the people who were saying he was out of tune,

135
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,750
is that he was playing quarter-tone pitches,

136
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,860
by which he meant that he's playing the notes

137
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,853
in between the two adjacent keys on the piano.

138
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,220
If you play the exact ratio of quarter notes,

139
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,353
then you're in tune.

140
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,273
You're in tune.

141
00:09:35,273 --> 00:09:37,430
You're not in tune with the rest of the planet,

142
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,080
but you're in tune with yourself.

143
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,370
In my classes at one college

144
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,570
where I teach the history of jazz,

145
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,780
when I play that some people say,

146
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,783
just gives me a migraine headache.

147
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,890
Well, I don't know what to say to you,

148
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:58,050
but I would agree, it's not easy to listen to,

149
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,370
but that's not what you think about

150
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,203
when you're writing music.

151
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:03,183
Is it gonna be easy to listen to, you know?

152
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,123
To be perfected,

153
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:13,500
and acknowledged without ever having to

154
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,423
sell out, what they call sell out,

155
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:21,729
I'm for that all the way.

156
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:33,021
(scat singing)

157
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:46,148
(dissonant piano music)

158
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:55,053
It seems to me what music is, is everything that you do.

159
00:10:57,142 --> 00:10:59,863
Straight from the heart.

160
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,973
So.

161
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,580
So to read or dance, you know,

162
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,580
to converse is all a part of the making of music.

163
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,670
Cecil and Ornette come from

164
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,613
very different parts of the musical map.

165
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:01,130
You had Ornette who comes out of the southwestern style,

166
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,730
where he has a really raw jagged approach

167
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,790
to the tempered scale that's made a lot of people

168
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,013
compare him to blues and rhythm and blues.

169
00:12:11,416 --> 00:12:14,916
(avant-garde piano music)

170
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,790
Cecil Taylor obviously listened to Ellington.

171
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,053
He knew Bud Powell.

172
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,310
He studied formally.

173
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,030
He studied at the New England Conservatory.

174
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,750
He had an education, not only in Europe,

175
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,800
but he grew up listening to a lot of pop.

176
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,350
So he listened to all of that stuff growing up,

177
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,753
but he had his own approach.

178
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,303
A lot of people misunderstand him.

179
00:13:18,593 --> 00:13:22,463
He's kind of microscopic in his improvisations.

180
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,360
But in a certain way, because it's so dense,

181
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,573
it reminds me of mountains,

182
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,620
oceans, all these kinds of elements,

183
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,523
not human elements.

184
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:50,773
(avant-garde piano)

185
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,390
The point is you have to understand this music

186
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,290
in terms of the traditional jazz that you've heard before.

187
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,017
Next question please.

188
00:14:23,256 --> 00:14:25,710
Now, when we talk about jazz,

189
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,940
we use these terrible semantic terms

190
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,790
that sort of create battle lines.

191
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:33,760
For example, bop is a meaningless word, bebop.

192
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,616
It has to do with the sound of a drum lick.

193
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,530
It's a shorthand for communication.

194
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,890
So that if I say to you bebop,

195
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,220
you immediately think Charlie Parker,

196
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,680
Dizzy Gillespie, Bud Powell.

197
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,370
If I say avant-garde, you think Cecil Taylor,

198
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,620
Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Albert Ayler.

199
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,050
Swing, Benny Goodman, Count Basie.

200
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,280
Although, you know, the truth is,

201
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:54,230
and the farther we get away in time for any movement,

202
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,490
you see how there is a real logic in how

203
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,630
all of these musics really do have an interactive,

204
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,770
not just progression,

205
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,574
but just sort of feed on each other.

206
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:05,991
(gun firing)

207
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,810
A gun.

208
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,800
Mingus initially made a very interesting remark

209
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,633
about Ornette.

210
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,820
He said that Ornette is like,

211
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,770
he's playing in his own world

212
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,140
and it doesn't relate to anybody else's world.

213
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,513
This is the bass.

214
00:15:21,923 --> 00:15:22,756
Mingus Mingus.

215
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,880
But eventually Mingus's music itself

216
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,903
became more consciously avant-garde.

217
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,133
Charlie Mingus was always ahead of the game.

218
00:15:42,283 --> 00:15:45,560
I mean, he played during the period with Bird,

219
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,840
but there was not that much of a big divide

220
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,733
between what we were doing and what he was doing.

221
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,430
One must remember that he came from

222
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,353
the same neighborhood as Eric.

223
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:11,280
I came from a more oriented bebop style,

224
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,650
so when I saw Eric Dolphy for the first time,

225
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,100
I couldn't stand Eric Dolphy because that felt like

226
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,850
he couldn't even play the saxophone

227
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,820
And then the second time I seen Eric Dolphy,

228
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,650
he turned out to be my most favorite musician of all times.

229
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:45,116
So then I embraced that kind of music,

230
00:16:45,116 --> 00:16:47,373
the freeform, avant-garde jazz.

231
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,070
One of the things that makes the avant-garde different

232
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,670
from every other school of jazz,

233
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,650
certainly that proceeded it, and I think that's followed it,

234
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:02,640
is that the major figures

235
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,040
all come from very discreet backgrounds.

236
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,070
I mean, these are artists spread

237
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:11,130
all over the United States geographically.

238
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,020
So first off, tell me where you're from.

239
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,030
Well, I'm from New Orleans.

240
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,560
Oh, it's a place called Texas,

241
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,670
okay, Fort Worth, Texas.

242
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:20,830
Yeah, that's where I'm from.

243
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,760
And here's the great Ornette Coleman.

244
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,830
We used to play in the auditorium at our high school.

245
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,760
I think I met Ornette Coleman in Texas.

246
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,240
Then I moved to Los Angeles.

247
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,520
As fate or whatever would have it,

248
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,390
I'm on the street car one day,

249
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,100
and there was Ornette Coleman.

250
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,210
And in the months that followed,

251
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,140
I played around town with him.

252
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,443
There were places to go to jam sessions all over LA, then.

253
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,480
When Ornette Coleman started to make

254
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,830
his move around Los Angeles,

255
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,680
going to the jam sessions to sit in,

256
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,390
he was up against a real brick wall, but he hung in there.

257
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,590
You can see and finally got some people surrounded him,

258
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,780
you know, who were sympathetic,

259
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,473
empathetic to what he was doing.

260
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,450
When Ornette came to town,

261
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,060
he ran into Don Cherry.

262
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,690
They didn't know each other.

263
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:13,150
And Don Cherry was ready.

264
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:18,070
And then Charlie was also completely willing and able

265
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,480
and joined his band.

266
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,873
And Ornette now could write for another person.

267
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,240
You ran into people around town

268
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,160
any time you went out to play.

269
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,420
I used to go to jam sessions with Eric Dolphy,

270
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,520
and here's a guy who was a really great player,

271
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,690
and no disrespect to Eric in saying what I'm saying.

272
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,300
A lot of people seemed to think that Eric

273
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,990
was one of the figures around Los Angeles

274
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,990
who was playing some sort of free jazz.

275
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,260
That's not true.

276
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,460
He was not going around town

277
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,050
doing anything like Ornette Coleman was doing.

278
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,580
And Eric was really good, man.

279
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:56,510
But I see him as just a very sophisticated bebopper then.

280
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,580
Now when he came to New York,

281
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,473
things began to go another direction.

282
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,470
But once Eric came to New York,

283
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:07,730
I think what was happening in New York, in that period now,

284
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,030
late 50s, early 60s,

285
00:19:11,136 --> 00:19:12,060
a lot of people were flirting

286
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,014
with going, in quotes, now outside.

287
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:18,014
(avant-garde music)

288
00:19:24,432 --> 00:19:26,410
What brought you to New York?

289
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,243
The music.

290
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,693
brought you to New York?

291
00:19:31,693 --> 00:19:32,943
Prince Lasha.

292
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:38,583
What a character. (laughing)

293
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,550
Yeah, he's my man.

294
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,180
Yeah, I'm looking for some questions.

295
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,460
Do you have any?

296
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,570
What's that?
You have any questions?

297
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:49,120
I need to ask, you have any questions?

298
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,250
Ask me?
Questions?

299
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,550
Yeah, I got plenty of answers, man, come on.

300
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,130
The way we came to New York,

301
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:57,260
back in '60-

302
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,210
'63.

303
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:00,357
Yeah, '63, sure was man.

304
00:20:00,357 --> 00:20:01,940
How could I ever forget that? Thanks, Don.

305
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,990
Let me tell you that story.

306
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,853
Okay, make sure your mics are on.

307
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,090
Yeah, here's what happened, man.

308
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,870
My worthy constituent, my orangutan, Sir (indistinct).

309
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,120
We were at a music store,

310
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,063
and he was listening to this music.

311
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:17,790
I said, who is that?

312
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,203
He said, Eric Dolphy.

313
00:20:19,203 --> 00:20:20,760
I said, Eric who?

314
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,980
He said, Eric Dolphy.

315
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:24,514
I said damn, where is he?

316
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,740
He said, he's in New York.

317
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,490
I said, is he gonna be ready to leave in two weeks?

318
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,500
He said, what?

319
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,150
I say, I'm leaving for New York,

320
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,140
because my worthy constituent Ornette Coleman

321
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,200
was the God of freedom.

322
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,070
And here is Eric Dolphy right?

323
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,393
I want to see this mother, you know what I mean?

324
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,782
So at this time I already had a record out

325
00:20:43,782 --> 00:20:46,010
with Prince Lasha called, The Cry,

326
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,373
and it was making waves in the world.

327
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,890
I'm gonna get read to the meat of the story.

328
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:57,440
I repaired a Chrysler, I had an eight-cylinder Chrysler.

329
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,013
Sure did, man, we drove across the US.

330
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,940
And I remember very vividly,

331
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,613
that we were on the freeway,

332
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:11,283
what we thought was a freeway at that time.

333
00:21:11,283 --> 00:21:14,020
4:00 a.m. in the morning, man.

334
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,430
So I was really tired.

335
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,126
Gorilla was tired.

336
00:21:17,126 --> 00:21:19,983
So I give it to my orangutan to drive at night, you know?

337
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:22,720
And so at a certain moment,

338
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,560
I hear all these sirens and lights and everything,

339
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,420
and they pull us over, and said, you know,

340
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,280
you're driving on the wrong side of the highway.

341
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,710
This cat was a smooth talker.

342
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,310
I observed that right off, man.

343
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,140
This cat was a smooth con artist.

344
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,730
We had no idea it was two lanes, you know.

345
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,763
We was used to two going and two coming.

346
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,193
So they tell us go.

347
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:46,271
Free at last.

348
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:47,271
Very good.

349
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,673
So that's part of the story.

350
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,353
Want to hear the rest of the story?

351
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,410
Okay, ask me any questions.

352
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,290
I can answer anything.

353
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,540
Did you call Dolphy

354
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,373
while you were on the road?

355
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:02,644
Look, I'm surprised you asked me that question.

356
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:03,477
When I called Eric Dolphy,

357
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:06,710
what do I hear on the record player, but The Cry!

358
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,570
He said, man, I'm listening to you now.

359
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,320
I said, yeah, I can hear it.

360
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,343
I don't believe it.

361
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,220
Then all the cats that play great music

362
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,920
and great stars and recording artists

363
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,943
came over to the loft to play with the Prince and I.

364
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,133
And it was great, man.

365
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,630
We had an ally in the back of our pad,

366
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,793
and one evening I heard-

367
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,390
I look out the window because we could see

368
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,700
right from the kitchen table window,

369
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,490
and look out in the back and see who's there.

370
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:57,883
And it's Prince Lasha.

371
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:01,703
I got up from the table and went outside,

372
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,640
and he had another guy with him

373
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,050
that I didn't recognize right away.

374
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,243
And after millisecond, I did.

375
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,363
John Coltrane,

376
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,233
the high and mighty one.

377
00:23:42,571 --> 00:23:45,071
I moved to New York in 1960,

378
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,383
which was a wonderful period in this city.

379
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,310
There was so much creativity,

380
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,333
and so many artists, musicians.

381
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:59,393
I call it like one of the golden periods.

382
00:24:00,986 --> 00:24:03,403
(jazz music)

383
00:24:13,562 --> 00:24:14,903
There was an immediacy in the air, man.

384
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:17,203
It was like a short fuse and a long explosion.

385
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,000
I was into now, doing it now.

386
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,850
Whatever it was, I had to do it, now.

387
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,890
Coltrane would come to town when I was in Philly,

388
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,580
and we had a place in Philly called Music City.

389
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,450
So I went down there,

390
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,370
I got myself good and fucked up on some wine and shit.

391
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:48,140
I felt like I could do anything at that point.

392
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,660
And I asked him to let me sit in, but he wasn't having it.

393
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,967
And I was bugging him a lot, you know?

394
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,330
And so he told me, he said, well look man,

395
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,300
what you really need to do, Rashied,

396
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,520
you just need to go to New York,

397
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,990
because there's a lot of guys in New York,

398
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,910
playing this kind of music that you're interested in.

399
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,090
I mean, just like John said it, man, I was,

400
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,200
they was waiting for me here.

401
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,460
I mean, first I have to say that almost every week,

402
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,723
literally, almost every week for a couple of years,

403
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:17,363
there was somebody new in town.

404
00:25:18,578 --> 00:25:21,995
(avant-garde jazz music)

405
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,310
And it took a while before the movement, in a sense,

406
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,483
gave them a legitimacy that they didn't have individually.

407
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,700
One of the big moments

408
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:46,789
that sort of began the idea that there's a movement here.

409
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:49,150
This is bullshit, man.

410
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,450
That these young musicians,

411
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,310
all thinking in a similar way,

412
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,970
was when Ornette Coleman made a record

413
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,033
in 1960 called, Free Jazz.

414
00:25:58,074 --> 00:26:01,574
(avant-garde jazz music)

415
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,883
Because that was the name.

416
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,419
(avant-garde jazz music)

417
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,330
I was in college when he did Free Jazz,

418
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,430
and he sent for me to make that recording.

419
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,740
It was just before the end of the semester,

420
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,620
which meant I would just fail the course,

421
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,043
and I decided to not go.

422
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,580
And so he sent me a ticket, as I remember,

423
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,050
and I sent it back.

424
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,600
And people say to me all the time, man,

425
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
you should have made that famous record.

426
00:26:52,037 --> 00:26:55,537
(avant-garde jazz music)

427
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,243
That's a historic recording.

428
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,823
A lot of people had a lot of trouble with that.

429
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,923
That's a record.

430
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:33,560
Now you see that Ornette Coleman's earlier recordings,

431
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,840
you can still hear a thread of Charlie Parker

432
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,490
making its way through those early tunes, but free jazz man.

433
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,500
That apron string or,

434
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,030
or whatever, umbilical cord to bebop

435
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,010
certainly disappears on that, man.

436
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,593
That's all Ornette Coleman.

437
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,890
I knew there was a new era

438
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,260
on the scene of jazz music in America.

439
00:28:06,072 --> 00:28:08,655
(wind blowing)

440
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:25,841
(avant-garde jazz music)

441
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,450
(gasping)

442
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,430
Most people are used to only having

443
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,400
one melody going at a time,

444
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,400
and cannot cope with polyrhythms and polytonality.

445
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,670
But we were looking for that

446
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,453
freedom to play in any kind of tempo,

447
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:25,240
and each individual could play in his own tempo

448
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,380
and create melodies that were independent

449
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,743
in a way from what the other players were playing.

450
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,970
You had to break something down

451
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,783
to be able to create something new.

452
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:51,100
I said that improvisation is thought

453
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,020
informed by a passion and

454
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,140
conditioned by knowledge.

455
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,090
Don't mention it.

456
00:30:11,807 --> 00:30:15,620
And of course, Cecil Taylor made a great impact,

457
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,700
both positive and for the people that liked it,

458
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,823
and negative for the people that hated that type of music.

459
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,060
We were talking about how difficult the music was

460
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,000
for a lot of people.

461
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,250
And Cecil said,

462
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,873
the musician prepares, the audience should prepare to.

463
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:38,070
You know you have to prepare to understand literature,

464
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,200
to understand painting.

465
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,190
Why is music different?

466
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,930
It just scared the hell out of people,

467
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,820
because everybody who grew up thinking jazz is this.

468
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,010
You always know where the beat is.

469
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,730
Even if you don't know anything about harmony,

470
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:53,300
your brain tells you that the harmony will resolve.

471
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,820
All of those things are suddenly taken away.

472
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,850
And it was terrifying for people.

473
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:00,233
A lot of people just, what the hell is this?

474
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,813
This isn't even music.

475
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,080
With the avant-garde,

476
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,880
the critics thought it was

477
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,300
just a lot of untalented musicians

478
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,183
squawking on their instruments.

479
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:17,250
Downbeat said that this was poisoning

480
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,163
the minds of young musicians.

481
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,300
A lot of older musicians felt that way.

482
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,480
One time, man, I sat in with Max Roach's band,

483
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,763
and he had Clifford Jordan in the band.

484
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,210
Everybody was playing, and Jordan took a solo,

485
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:34,390
and Freddie took a solo,

486
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,070
and everybody was taking a solo,

487
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,420
and then I reached to hit the cymbal,

488
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,480
and looked and Clifford had took my cymbal away.

489
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,872
So I go, like I say, man, why you do that?

490
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,850
You see, man, I got tired of listen to that shit.

491
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:47,360
What kind of fucking shit is that?

492
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,640
How dare you, motherfucker,

493
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,650
come in here and sit in on Max Roach's drums?

494
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,150
Ah man, it was that kind of a thing I used to get.

495
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,260
But eventually Max Roach, in his later years,

496
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,570
who was, you know, the bebop drummer,

497
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,500
the most magisterial of drummers to come out of 1940s,

498
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,287
made duet albums with Cecil Taylor.

499
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:08,983
And he couldn't go further out than that.

500
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,180
But at the time the old guard felt

501
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,200
that they had the right to just dismiss

502
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,070
the avant-garde as charlatans, frauds.

503
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:19,400
For me, as far as I could see,

504
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,670
there wasn't much mingling between the,

505
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:26,643
between the established players and avant-garde players.

506
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,270
Miles at first was very critical.

507
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,420
He just had nothing good to say about them.

508
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,307
There was a notorious essay in Downbeat about Eric Dolphy.

509
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,520
A friend of mine opened a club in Berlin in '64,

510
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,040
and wanted us to play there as an opening,

511
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,830
and he said, could you like bring somebody, name person.

512
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:01,133
And I said, well Eric might want to play.

513
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,943
We were told to open the club in Berlin.

514
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,410
And I said, hey Eric,

515
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:12,940
And he had the Downbeat on his lap.

516
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,373
And he looked very sad, and he said,

517
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:20,590
I don't know why Miles put me down like that.

518
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,663
I really like him.

519
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:26,163
(avant-garde jazz music)

520
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:40,960
We brought him to this hotel in Berlin.

521
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,110
He ordered ice cream and juice

522
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,980
and Coca Cola and stuff like that.

523
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,080
That was his dinner.

524
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:51,913
And it turned out later that he was like a heavy diabetic,

525
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,109
He had no clue.

526
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:57,940
He had no clue that he had it.

527
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:01,500
He played the first song with us.

528
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,150
Then he said, excuse me,

529
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,210
I have to go into the dressing room,

530
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,520
and he didn't come out anymore.

531
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,570
And then I said to Karl, after another few songs,

532
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:17,500
we have to look where Eric is, and the door opened.

533
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,280
And Eric cried out,

534
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,010
on the floor

535
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,840
and he said, help me.

536
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,593
And we immediately brought him to the hospital.

537
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:32,210
And the doctor told us

538
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,170
that they had never seen so much sugar in anybody's blood.

539
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,193
Like it was just way beyond saving him.

540
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,044
And then we called his mother.

541
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,496
Did he tend to realize that how great he was?

542
00:34:55,496 --> 00:34:56,571
No.

543
00:34:56,571 --> 00:34:58,251
(muffled speaking)

544
00:34:58,251 --> 00:35:00,680
He was always real honest.

545
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,763
He wouldn't say anything.

546
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:07,180
We never realized either

547
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,797
how well thought of he was,

548
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:15,528
until he died.

549
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,660
Man, the cat was really a genius.

550
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,750
Here was a genius, right.

551
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,410
He was like something never I've ever heard, you know?

552
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,870
I ain't gonna get into Dolphy now,

553
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,933
he's beyond words with me,

554
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,953
not only as a supreme musician,

555
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,470
but a human being as which is rare in our day.

556
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,220
And especially in the music business,

557
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,393
where the slogan is dog eat dog.

558
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,680
In New York, it's a certain energy and creativity

559
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,853
that is really kind of hard to explain,

560
00:35:56,515 --> 00:35:58,740
but maybe it's because of, you know,

561
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,900
I, myself, man, I don't believe in,

562
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,510
I don't think of competition in music.

563
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,920
You know, I don't think of something being better or worse,

564
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,963
it's just different.

565
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:13,280
And I think that kind of thing brings a certain ego

566
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,120
that is keeping a lot of development

567
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,970
of musicians coming together.

568
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:20,170
You know, because everyone wants to feel

569
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,720
that they're doing something different

570
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,987
than everyone else is doing.

571
00:36:22,987 --> 00:36:25,810
And all the innovators that I've known in my life,

572
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,920
they all were playing their music

573
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,730
and trying to develop in music.

574
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,530
It wasn't to try to be an innovator.

575
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,800
And meeting Ornette Coleman,

576
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,530
coming out of the bebop period,

577
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,430
was like a whole study, which I could see,

578
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,543
like even now, I'm still like a disciple of his in music.

579
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,510
Don Cherry was smitten by Ornette.

580
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,330
They played like identical twins,

581
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,120
and that music was created

582
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,620
to the point where you think of Ornette and Don

583
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:03,100
being always together, but they weren't.

584
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,700
And Don was his own

585
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,110
absolutely inventive, unique musician,

586
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:15,110
who played maybe more perfectly than anyone I'd ever heard.

587
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,980
He never lived to the point where anyone got used to him,

588
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,090
and said, oh, you know, Don doing that,

589
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,170
no one ever got used to him.

590
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,900
And I never certainly got used to him.

591
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:31,900
I was in awe of him till the day he was gone and still am.

592
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,850
But he was beautiful.

593
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,000
He came up to our house

594
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,623
for two weeks to do cold turkey,

595
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:11,427
and he came, but he was already so out of it.

596
00:38:17,859 --> 00:38:19,410
He was beautiful.

597
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:23,720
Intelligent, and he was fantastic,

598
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,870
with a real level of musicianship

599
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,213
and human being like Ornette.

600
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,970
And then he told me then,

601
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,743
going to New York is my downfall.

602
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,040
New York, see like I've been in New York at times

603
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,947
when it was very hard and no place to sleep, no food, no-

604
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,480
I mean, even then, I mean,

605
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,130
you feel that New York has some kind of a conscience.

606
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,823
I mean, you go into paying all these dudes.

607
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,980
Karl, me, and Don, play the concert.

608
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,640
And then afterwards he came up and said, Ingrid,

609
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,620
can you lend me some money for a taxi?

610
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,200
And I said, Don, didn't you get paid?

611
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,780
He said, no, they don't pay me

612
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,170
because it didn't bring enough audience.

613
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,680
In New York at that time,

614
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,020
there was a level at which black players

615
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,940
were not gonna get what white players were playing

616
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,833
in the same club.

617
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:23,250
What it amounted to was Ornette decided at one point

618
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,700
that the clubs weren't paying him at what they should.

619
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,207
The club that happened to be the focus of that

620
00:39:27,207 --> 00:39:28,780
was the Five Spot.

621
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,880
We had played there,

622
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,710
and the place was packed every night.

623
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,030
And Ornette had decided that he wasn't gonna work

624
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,920
unless they paid his price.

625
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,270
There's no magic here.

626
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,220
You've got a wife and a couple of kids.

627
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:45,140
Ornette was fighting for musicians being paid better.

628
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,170
It was not for him alone, it was for everybody.

629
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,730
When I retreated in America,

630
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,490
because I was mad about

631
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,410
and heard about how my relationship was.

632
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,890
I was reading a paper where I was selling like 3000 records

633
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:00,650
and I'd be evicted the next month, you see?

634
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,090
Then it doesn't make any sense for me

635
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,403
to be what I thought I was,

636
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:06,703
that they had made me what I thought I wasn't, you know?

637
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,370
So I just said, okay, you know, I mean,

638
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,110
I grew up without being,

639
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,610
I grew up hungry so I can be hungry now, you know.

640
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,474
It's not gonna be any different, you know.

641
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:22,910
That was the shock of my life,

642
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,990
as a European,

643
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,460
finding that respectlessness

644
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,550
to these fantastic jazz musicians.

645
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:35,050
For me, it's the true art form of US.

646
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:38,090
Jazz could have happened, happened nowhere else.

647
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:40,160
No respect.

648
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,053
So I said to Karl, I'm going back to Europe.

649
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,470
We went both to Ornette.

650
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:48,690
Ornette was really very insistent.

651
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,590
He said, you gotta stay, you gotta stay, you gotta stay.

652
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:57,510
It was devastating to see how the musicians were living,

653
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,420
and what was going on and how the music was being treated.

654
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,890
When you see the bands coming to Europe,

655
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,120
and you go to the concerts,

656
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,120
and see that glamorous flashy performances they make,

657
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,010
you get an idea in your mind about it.

658
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:16,563
Oh my they're stars.

659
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:20,110
But then when I came to the States,

660
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,977
and I saw how some of the musicians were living,

661
00:41:21,977 --> 00:41:24,520
and I said, there's something wrong here.

662
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,040
The situation is still the same

663
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,060
for African-American musicians,

664
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,830
or have things gotten better?

665
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,370
Well, I don't see how they can get better

666
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,280
for black musicians

667
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,400
until they get better for black people.

668
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,840
We can't protect our culture

669
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,390
until we can actually alter economic and social institutions

670
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:42,333
to reflect better our needs and our desires, I think.

671
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,373
The music of the 60's,

672
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,740
it was like the music of the 40's,

673
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,320
except the guys from the 40's,

674
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,770
they were doing it from a diff,

675
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,730
they were doing it from the night club,

676
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:55,690
and that was their thing.

677
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,043
We weren't allowed in the nightclub.

678
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:03,330
In fact, that was the reason

679
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,803
I formed the Jazz Composers Guild.

680
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,450
It, started with me being invited

681
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:15,540
to Bill Dixon's workshop orchestra.

682
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,280
And there I met Rudd.

683
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,940
It was a very diverse group of personalities,

684
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,960
and was very colorful, I think almost too colorful.

685
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,750
See, I don't have these Bourgeoisie concepts

686
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,630
about time and space and death and taxes

687
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,560
and insurance companies.

688
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,143
It's all a bore, but okay, we'll talk about that.

689
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,520
So, okay.

690
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:40,340
Bill, Bill Dixon, and Cecil

691
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,590
had a great idea.

692
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:44,850
Why don't artists take this whole thing off the market

693
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,600
and put it in our own hands, have our own recording spaces.

694
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,920
And try to get support going

695
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,490
for grants, commissions,

696
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,270
and just through a strength in numbers, you know,

697
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:59,740
getting foundations to recognize what was happening.

698
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:02,160
The intention was to further the music

699
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,260
and to better the opportunities for the people involved.

700
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:08,000
We started to do concerts there,

701
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,237
and of course it started with the Cellar Cafe,

702
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:12,523
the October Revolution at the Cellar Cafe.

703
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:26,978
(avant-garde jazz music)

704
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,920
October revolution.

705
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,820
I didn't know anything about that actually.

706
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:41,130
At the time, once we started rehearsing, I said,

707
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:43,230
what are we rehearsing for?

708
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,450
And they were explaining to me

709
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:48,570
that there's a bunch of venues in New York in October,

710
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,843
we're gonna just bombard the city with new music.

711
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:56,540
It was about, there is no environment for this music,

712
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,180
so let's create one.

713
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,320
They made a real difference

714
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,700
in the music that we were playing.

715
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:04,420
In fact, they made a lot of people aware

716
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,240
of what we were doing.

717
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,073
They really did.

718
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,270
The October Revolution is all part of a sense

719
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,250
of creating a movement,

720
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,390
of creating some kind of guild of musicians

721
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,750
for those who are basically alienated

722
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,443
by the mainstream jazz world.

723
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:23,223
Dixon and Taylor saw the long-term objective here.

724
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,103
Together we stand, divided we fall.

725
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,820
But some of the guys didn't get it.

726
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,560
And I think that was the demise of the Guild.

727
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:34,770
It lasted about six months, but the guys were too hungry.

728
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:35,770
I'm not gonna mention names,

729
00:44:35,770 --> 00:44:38,580
but a couple of guys signed a contract here, or did this.

730
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,180
Undermined the whole principle.

731
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,510
You've got to put teeth into it.

732
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:42,720
If you're gonna go on strike,

733
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,450
you can't go back and sign with the man.

734
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,510
But also another thing was the fact

735
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:51,090
that the personalities involved,

736
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:56,090
it was really hard to get everybody to conform as a unit.

737
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,650
Bill, can we bring back

738
00:44:57,650 --> 00:44:59,800
the community spirit to the music?

739
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,200
No, absolutely not.

740
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,250
Because you know why?

741
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,020
Young musicians don't want to go through that.

742
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,180
They all want to be famous.

743
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,860
But I mean, if I had to have money

744
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:12,833
and behaved the way these cats, no way, keep it.

745
00:45:22,117 --> 00:45:25,510
I had no place to live when I arrived in the city.

746
00:45:25,510 --> 00:45:28,500
And so I stayed,

747
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,000
I stayed overnight in Grand Central Station on a bench

748
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,810
and met a lot of homeless people.

749
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:38,900
And we would go and live in a different place every night.

750
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:42,263
And some of us were mentally ill.

751
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:47,190
A lot of us would wake up screaming, but that was okay.

752
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,260
I totally accepted it.

753
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,340
I thought this was life in New York City.

754
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,660
And it was fine.

755
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:54,550
I mean, everybody was okay in my book.

756
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:55,710
I just wanted to be there.

757
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:57,110
Everything was fine,

758
00:45:57,110 --> 00:46:01,200
whatever I had to eat, wherever I had to sleep,

759
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,813
whatever I heard was perfect.

760
00:46:16,104 --> 00:46:18,333
But the most interesting years of all

761
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:21,370
were the early 60's, that was it.

762
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:24,140
That's when the best music got created.

763
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,380
Everyone knew what they were doing.

764
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,490
They were at the height of their powers.

765
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,520
There was an individual,

766
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,270
there was individuality then,

767
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:36,440
and there were better feelings too, among musicians.

768
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,800
You didn't have, I mean,

769
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,517
there wasn't a competitive spirit in a certain kind of way.

770
00:46:40,517 --> 00:46:44,180
And we were all friends, all went to parties together,

771
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,480
had open house.

772
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,503
You know, it was different.

773
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,280
There was a great spiritual underground,

774
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,320
people knew, you know, what was happening then.

775
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,500
Everybody knew what was happening.

776
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,420
So the real main gigs in town, there weren't that many,

777
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,619
where we could play, like Slug's,

778
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:05,750
a few places like that.

779
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:07,700
Everybody knew and turned up.

780
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,030
It was support, you know.

781
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:11,800
We all knew each other, we all played with each other.

782
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,130
There was a period when I lived on 3rd Street,

783
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:18,890
between 1st and 2nd, and Sun Ra lived on the block.

784
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:20,080
I lived on the block.

785
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,120
Dave Burrell lived on the block.

786
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,620
Kind of hard to remember the sequences

787
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,130
of all this stuff, because-

788
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:28,460
Norris Jones.

789
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,470
Noah Howard lived across the street.

790
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:32,540
Rick Colbeck lived down the street,

791
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,210
Pharaoh Sanders lived around the corner.

792
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,840
Dave Burrell was living right across the street,

793
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:39,890
he and Bobby Kapp.

794
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:43,310
And so this was Marion Brown's apartment.

795
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:45,510
Marion sorta lived at Archie's.

796
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:50,013
You had all these musicians in a concentrated area.

797
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:56,023
Marion Brown, Dave Burrell, myself, Bobby Kapp.

798
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,200
That was a good group.

799
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,000
We were always over at each other's houses,

800
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,153
just messing around.

801
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:15,640
And Marion Brown could just carry on

802
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,733
a musical conversation for hours.

803
00:48:20,091 --> 00:48:22,420
I found out he can be an intellectual,

804
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,173
and be a jazz musician too.

805
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,500
We had this conversations a lot,

806
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:29,663
about what is the pianist's role?

807
00:48:30,809 --> 00:48:34,309
(avant-garde jazz music)

808
00:48:40,426 --> 00:48:43,970
In my head, I was doing whatever I felt like doing,

809
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:46,003
whenever I felt like doing it.

810
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,213
Marion Brown, he was on my first quintet record.

811
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:17,740
Marion had this really, you know, lyrical thing.

812
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:20,080
He could float over everything.

813
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,823
He was an introspective guy.

814
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,560
When I first came to New York,

815
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:30,830
I didn't even know Marion Brown was a musician,

816
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,890
because he didn't have a horn, he wasn't playing.

817
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,290
He was just hanging out.

818
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,870
He was just hanging out and hanging out,

819
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:37,680
just hanging out with everybody.

820
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,110
And I never seen him with a horn.

821
00:49:39,110 --> 00:49:40,290
I didn't even know what he was.

822
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,040
I just thought he just liked music.

823
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,490
And then we was up in Archie's playing,

824
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:47,400
just me and Archie.

825
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,060
And then Marion comes up there and he say, man,

826
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,073
I bought myself an alto saxophone.

827
00:49:52,550 --> 00:49:54,023
And I looked at him, you know, like,

828
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:56,947
but I didn't know his history.

829
00:49:56,947 --> 00:49:58,050
He had been a player before.

830
00:49:58,050 --> 00:49:59,440
I didn't know that.

831
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,770
He turned out to be a hell of a musician,

832
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,000
but I thought he had just started playing.

833
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,280
So I kinda was like, kinda cool with him, you know?

834
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,580
'Cause I didn't come to New York to play with amateurs.

835
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:12,123
I came to New York to play with professional players.

836
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,730
One time I was playing with Albert,

837
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,310
and we were playing and

838
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:28,850
somebody came over to the drum set, saying man, you know,

839
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:30,950
Coltrane just walked in.

840
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:31,970
I went, yeah, where where?

841
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,647
I was trying to find out where he was,

842
00:50:33,647 --> 00:50:35,223
and Albert started playing.

843
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:38,870
I'm sure John wasn't trying to intimidate nobody,

844
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,010
but the room was full.

845
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:41,000
A lot of people was in the room.

846
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,833
He couldn't get in a place.

847
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:44,190
So he got a chair and he brought it out

848
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:47,303
in the middle of the aisle so he could see.

849
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,503
And man, I saw John.

850
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,339
Man, he said, man, that you see that?

851
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:55,172
I say, what?

852
00:50:55,172 --> 00:50:56,270
You say Coltrane was out there, man.

853
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,090
He say, why did he come to my gig, man?

854
00:50:58,090 --> 00:50:59,480
I say, man, he's just checking you out.

855
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,360
He say, man, why did he come to my gig?

856
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,230
He pulled the chair all way up

857
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,890
in the middle of the aisle and shit,

858
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:06,110
and say, man, I could hardly even play.

859
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,117
I said, look, man, I don't know why he did that.

860
00:51:09,117 --> 00:51:10,000
And he say, man,

861
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,470
he looked like he was looking right down

862
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,720
the bell of my horn, man.

863
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:16,910
Well, anytime John would show anyplace,

864
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,657
Trane would show anyplace (indistinct).

865
00:51:20,505 --> 00:51:21,460
Trane is in the house man.

866
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:24,030
Chief, we'd call him Chief, Chief is in the house.

867
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,410
It was really cool, man,

868
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:27,900
'cause that shows you the kind of cat Coltrane was,

869
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:28,733
you know what I mean?

870
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:30,720
He was always looking for something different,

871
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,330
looking for something different to do.

872
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:34,761
I mean, he wasn't never satisfied

873
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:36,730
with just doing what he was doing.

874
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:38,840
If you followed John Coltrane,

875
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,960
every record took you to a place

876
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,500
that was way far from the last one.

877
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:47,390
You really were able to follow from

878
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:48,840
the guy who came up playing

879
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,590
in second rate R and B bands in Philadelphia

880
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:55,323
to the pinnacle of jazz as Miles's sideman.

881
00:51:58,468 --> 00:52:03,273
To Giant Steps, to Love Supreme, which everybody loved.

882
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,660
Huge success, to Ascension,

883
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,870
which scared off the entire audience

884
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,320
that had bought Love Supreme.

885
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:23,950
Coltrane troubled the old guard,

886
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,480
and the old guard critics the most.

887
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,470
Because if you didn't dig Ornette,

888
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,540
if you didn't dig Cecil,

889
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,340
you could just say that guy doesn't know what he's doing.

890
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,190
You couldn't say that about Coltrane.

891
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,330
You couldn't say Coltrane can't play,

892
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:39,103
because Coltrane was already a superstar in jazz.

893
00:52:40,707 --> 00:52:43,800
For the avant-garde, it was liberating.

894
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,460
It just changed everything.

895
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,850
This was the baddest band in jazz.

896
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,410
The John Coltrane Quartet.

897
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:51,243
That was it.

898
00:52:51,243 --> 00:52:53,190
I mean, you know, Miles Davis was before that,

899
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,350
but John had the banner then,

900
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:59,170
and he was the baddest thing that ever walked.

901
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:03,290
John Coltrane was the father of the scene,

902
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:05,100
the father of all of us.

903
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,410
And he was our spiritual leader,

904
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,973
but he was a tangible person

905
00:53:11,973 --> 00:53:15,230
that you could actually befriend.

906
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,890
Coltrane was the Parker of our era.

907
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:22,160
It's hard not to want to play

908
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,140
what he played.

909
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,120
Even now I mean,

910
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,563
I listen him and just incredible,

911
00:53:28,259 --> 00:53:30,300
he always gives me something new.

912
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,100
Archie Shepp was working at this department store

913
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,430
during the day and he didn't want to do that kind of stuff.

914
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:39,620
And actually John lifted him out of that gloomy shit.

915
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,470
John gave him the shot, put him on a couple of records,

916
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:44,770
took him on tour a couple of times

917
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:46,293
and got him started, you know?

918
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:57,750
Bob Thiele, being a producer at Impulse at the time,

919
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,010
had said that if he would listen to John Coltrane,

920
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,370
he would be recording everybody.

921
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,750
John was doing that for everybody.

922
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,150
He did the same with Albert.

923
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,920
He used to pay people's rent and their shit.

924
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,070
If they couldn't pay rent, they would call John

925
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:15,110
and he would send them money.

926
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:17,820
I mean, this is the kind of guy he was.

927
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,163
So I didn't even have a clue he was sick.

928
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,163
And then I found out

929
00:54:22,163 --> 00:54:24,023
that he had this history of liver cancer.

930
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,353
But I never noticed that until the last gig we played.

931
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,820
And for the first time ever,

932
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:34,373
I seen John sit down and play, and he never sat down.

933
00:54:35,796 --> 00:54:37,996
And three months later, after that, he died.

934
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:41,760
While John was alive,

935
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:43,710
everybody was trying to play this music.

936
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,450
Everybody was playing avant-garde, the music was there.

937
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,990
And you talking about gigs being scarce,

938
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,593
man, we wasn't working hardly nowhere at that point.

939
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:55,500
It was in a bad time when John left the music,

940
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:59,520
because the biggest name in jazz was gone,

941
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,643
and that whole thing went with him.

942
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,393
It killed it.

943
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:07,538
(mournful jazz music)

944
00:55:14,982 --> 00:55:18,149
(audience applauding)

945
00:55:23,479 --> 00:55:26,729
(jazz saxophone music)

946
00:55:49,410 --> 00:55:51,130
When Albert came, in Cleveland,

947
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:53,630
Albert Ayler came from Cleveland, everybody knew him,

948
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,750
the minute, we were all somehow begged, borrowed, stole,

949
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:57,720
and got up to the top floor of Philharmonic Hall

950
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,367
when he came out,

951
00:55:59,367 --> 00:56:00,870
and we heard him in the dressing room

952
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:01,850
before he came on stage,

953
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:05,160
Cecil was already started playing with this group,

954
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,700
and we heard Albert in the dressing room,

955
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,023
and that towering sound.

956
00:56:21,202 --> 00:56:22,073
He was a saxophone player, man,

957
00:56:22,073 --> 00:56:24,230
that we all are thinking

958
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,540
we just broke the sound barrier, wow.

959
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:29,763
Here's a guy that's gonna take us to another planet.

960
00:56:31,832 --> 00:56:33,182
Is that what we want to do?

961
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,550
A lot of people you see would talk about

962
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:37,810
what they heard Albert Ayler do,

963
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:39,810
but they weren't willing to participate.

964
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,970
Nobody got successful, hardly at that time.

965
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:56,273
Albert, as great as he was, died with practically nothing.

966
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,013
The East River.

967
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,610
I mean, every time when you were around Albert,

968
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:13,993
you always felt that you were around a spirit.

969
00:57:23,556 --> 00:57:24,903
Not everybody gets the message,

970
00:57:24,903 --> 00:57:28,723
or wanted to, other believers.

971
00:57:32,037 --> 00:57:35,010
The ever seeing eye is always watching us,

972
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,910
that we must be well aware of this,

973
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:39,503
because it's getting late now.

974
00:58:02,635 --> 00:58:05,100
And there's a very talented man, you see,

975
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:09,940
daring, but convinced about what he was doing, you know.

976
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:13,147
If you're not convinced, boy, they'll destroy you.

977
00:58:13,147 --> 00:58:16,503
You have to really be pretty well sure of what you're doing.

978
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34,460
None of us are alike.

979
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,943
None of us are alike.

980
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:46,020
We have many examples of individual pursuits

981
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:48,473
that enlightened all of us,

982
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,693
either with the light,

983
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,953
or with the darkness.

984
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,050
I started to think in terms

985
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:04,363
of what I'd like to do as an individual.

986
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:10,703
I encountered some spirits who happen to feel the same way.

987
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,590
And from there as the AACM, we proceeded.

988
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:19,380
The AACM stands for

989
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,980
the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.

990
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:28,460
And our mission from the very beginning in Chicago,

991
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:33,460
was to create and perform unrecorded new music.

992
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:40,373
And it was headed by none other than Muhal Richard Abrams.

993
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,340
We did have a rule.

994
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,403
One rule within the AACM.

995
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,073
You had to do your own music,

996
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,530
no other music except yours.

997
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:58,740
The Association

998
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:00,220
for the Advancement of Creative Musicians,

999
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:05,220
was a group of spiritualists who were trying to search

1000
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,573
for what is the meaning of music?

1001
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:11,130
Nobody had any money.

1002
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:16,130
We all come from poverty and no one would give an inch

1003
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:19,180
with respect to their aesthetics and their music.

1004
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,510
The problem was

1005
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,440
to produce a community from a group of people

1006
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:30,580
who really had very diverse ideas about sound.

1007
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:31,910
What brought them together,

1008
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,190
what brought them together was a shared sense

1009
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:36,850
that they should be responsible for each other.

1010
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,240
I come from a family who believed in unions,

1011
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:44,240
strong unions, and I looked at the AACM as like a union.

1012
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:47,230
Yeah, when I saw the AACM in Chicago,

1013
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,660
and the fact that they were organized in a very formal way

1014
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:54,060
and presenting themselves on a weekly, monthly basis,

1015
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,850
and having meetings and memberships and all of that.

1016
01:00:56,850 --> 01:01:00,660
And I came back to Saint Louis and got our guys together

1017
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,140
who were having our informal jam sessions and said,

1018
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,293
why don't we become a branch of the AACM in Saint Louis?

1019
01:01:15,491 --> 01:01:17,280
And someone said, no, wait a minute.

1020
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:21,750
Let's do our own thing here in Saint Louis.

1021
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:24,670
And so we started the Black Artists Group.

1022
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:29,670
So now outside of Chicago and Saint Louis,

1023
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,580
nobody really still weren't familiar

1024
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,640
with what we were doing.

1025
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:34,630
And I have to say,

1026
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:38,300
maybe Europe got more familiar and acquainted

1027
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:41,473
with this music before the US.

1028
01:01:55,950 --> 01:02:00,793
The Art Ensemble was invited to Paris, France,

1029
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:04,823
but it wasn't The Art Ensemble until we got there.

1030
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,930
And when we got there, then we had to give a name.

1031
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,843
And that was the name we gave, Art Ensemble of Chicago.

1032
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:28,310
So the whole scene from Chicago went to Paris

1033
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:30,740
and they fell over the whole city.

1034
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:33,220
There wasn't a theater, there wasn't a room

1035
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,570
where you could play, where they wouldn't play.

1036
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:39,440
I left for Paris.

1037
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,540
I had a one-way ticket, I had $50 in my pocket.

1038
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:45,650
I took a taxi cab then to Montparnasse,

1039
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:47,290
which took something like $30.

1040
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:49,140
So I had $20 left.

1041
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,423
My motto was, play or die.

1042
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:57,143
Paris had been invaded by the Midwest and the Northeast.

1043
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,233
Everybody was there and it was like paradise.

1044
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,340
And every night the audience would have

1045
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,780
everybody that you could think of.

1046
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,163
Cecil Taylor was there,

1047
01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:15,280
and Ornette Coleman was there.

1048
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,650
This film was made during two days in Paris,

1049
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,290
spent with Ornette Coleman.

1050
01:03:20,695 --> 01:03:22,573
Ornette Coleman helped us quite a bit.

1051
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,220
Ornette Coleman came to our concerts,

1052
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:28,930
and it was my first opportunity to meet the great man.

1053
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:31,290
And he asked us to play the first half

1054
01:03:31,290 --> 01:03:33,290
on a concert that he was doing in Paris.

1055
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,670
All sold out.

1056
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:37,440
Thousands of people there.

1057
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,180
Well, Braxton, Jenkins, and Smith and McCall opened for him.

1058
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,103
He was a big champion of all of us.

1059
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:48,990
It was a symbolic gesture to endorse us.

1060
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:50,440
And after the concert,

1061
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,670
he invited me to live with him in New York,

1062
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,520
because I had never been to New York.

1063
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:57,870
When I was living in Europe.

1064
01:03:57,870 --> 01:04:02,100
And a lot of the expatriate musicians who lived there

1065
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:03,650
told me the same thing.

1066
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,980
They felt like they were giving out a lot,

1067
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,180
but they couldn't feel anything coming back.

1068
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,720
A lot of musicians who live in Europe

1069
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,730
always feel like they have to be recharged,

1070
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,163
and the recharging happens when you come home.

1071
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:21,240
After Coltrane's death,

1072
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,510
so many jazz musicians moved to Europe.

1073
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:29,490
In the early 1970s, they started coming back.

1074
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:32,450
A lot of players from Chicago and Saint Louis

1075
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:35,190
moved to New York from Paris.

1076
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,420
New York was the center of the world,

1077
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:39,780
especially the music world.

1078
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,110
We wanted to be a part of that.

1079
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:46,250
They had gone over to Europe and made a really big splash.

1080
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,310
The Art Ensemble, and Braxton as well.

1081
01:04:50,310 --> 01:04:52,110
Then they came back.

1082
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:56,320
But now the guys have a name.

1083
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:58,103
They are established.

1084
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:04,150
Then Columbia University

1085
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:06,593
invited us to do a whole series of concerts.

1086
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,512
Three days of all AACM music.

1087
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:13,043
Muhal was elated.

1088
01:05:14,587 --> 01:05:17,630
And Muhal is doing concerts everywhere.

1089
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:20,653
Muhal Richard Abrams did a concert in a church one day,

1090
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,410
in a downtown club the next,

1091
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,770
in an art gallery,

1092
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,420
always doing something different.

1093
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:31,303
The movement from the Midwest stimulated the whole scene.

1094
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:37,100
This whole experience with Muhal and the AACM,

1095
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:39,690
all of that set me up

1096
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:43,010
for what was to come.

1097
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:44,423
And what was to come?

1098
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:47,639
Sam Rivers.

1099
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:50,889
(tribal drums beating)

1100
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:58,900
Rolling?
Nobody hired Sam.

1101
01:05:58,900 --> 01:06:00,370
Rolling.

1102
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:02,353
Nobody would hire us in clubs.

1103
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:07,700
Sam always had musicians that would gravitate to him.

1104
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,800
He had an open space,

1105
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,670
and so he opened up a loft.

1106
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,080
Suddenly musicians started taking control,

1107
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,650
and they started turning their apartments,

1108
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:21,090
in areas that nobody wanted to live in,

1109
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,900
into lofts, musical spaces.

1110
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:26,329
Sam Rivers had Studio Rivbea.

1111
01:06:26,329 --> 01:06:27,410
I happened to run into this woman on day,

1112
01:06:27,410 --> 01:06:29,530
when I was just talking about, I need a place.

1113
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:30,363
I need a place to do this.

1114
01:06:30,363 --> 01:06:33,320
She said okay, I just bought this building.

1115
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,760
And I'll rent you out the first floor.

1116
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,060
And years later, I found out

1117
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:38,870
that it was Robert De Niro's mother.

1118
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:40,037
I didn't know it at that time.

1119
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:41,970
She never mentioned it at all.

1120
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:43,709
Robert Mapplethorpe was on the fourth floor.

1121
01:06:43,709 --> 01:06:44,903
We were good friends.

1122
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,773
He was a good friend of mine, Miro, yeah.

1123
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:50,840
He gave me one painting.

1124
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,736
I don't know if it was stolen.

1125
01:06:52,736 --> 01:06:54,630
I never did find out where it is.

1126
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:57,147
So whoever's got my Miro painting out there.

1127
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,480
It's on there, Samuel Rivers, 1969, boom.

1128
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:07,890
Sam had a lot of connections.

1129
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:09,500
He was a little older than we were.

1130
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,980
And he had done the Blue Note recordings.

1131
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:15,180
He had worked with Cecil Taylor.

1132
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,156
He had created a whole new music scene.

1133
01:07:18,156 --> 01:07:18,989
Miles Davis.

1134
01:07:18,989 --> 01:07:20,680
Miles Davis.

1135
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,300
I played with Charlie Parker, too.

1136
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:25,810
So musicians gravitated

1137
01:07:25,810 --> 01:07:27,257
to Studio Rivbea.

1138
01:07:29,604 --> 01:07:32,750
Studio Rivbea was a family run affair.

1139
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:37,140
The publicity was run by Bea Rivers, Sam's wife.

1140
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:41,390
The people at the door collecting the money was Sam's kids.

1141
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:46,390
Sam presented anyone whose music he felt was presentable.

1142
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:49,523
And you got paid for the gig.

1143
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:53,350
The only thing he said to me ever

1144
01:07:53,350 --> 01:07:55,580
in all the years we played together.

1145
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:56,923
Keep the energy up.

1146
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,833
That was it.

1147
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:02,090
The loft scene, once that got started,

1148
01:08:02,090 --> 01:08:04,270
it took off no matter where it was.

1149
01:08:04,270 --> 01:08:07,350
At Ladies' Fort, Joe Lee Wilson's place,

1150
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:09,400
down on Bond Street.

1151
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,240
Studio Wish, where Warren Smith had his place.

1152
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,290
The loft that I had

1153
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,540
was kind of centrally located on 21st street.

1154
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,750
Max Roach was using it as a rehearsal spot.

1155
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:24,370
And when people heard him playing with this group,

1156
01:08:24,370 --> 01:08:27,080
they would walk over the rooftops and down the fire escape

1157
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:28,703
and climb in the back window.

1158
01:08:30,594 --> 01:08:32,290
And my partner, Anton Reed said,

1159
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,823
we ought to make this into a presentation.

1160
01:08:48,086 --> 01:08:50,920
It was Max Roach's idea with all those percussionists,

1161
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:54,970
form a group like Boom Boom, was all percussion.

1162
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:58,893
So we began rehearsing every week with that for a year.

1163
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:05,000
The fact that we were rehearsing all the time

1164
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,890
and attracting audiences to the rehearsals,

1165
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:13,890
kind of made the spontaneous theatrical presentation,

1166
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:16,380
just explode where, you know,

1167
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:18,537
that's how the whole loft scene developed.

1168
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,060
What made it work, people's tastes had changed.

1169
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:31,163
They wanted a more informal kind of setting.

1170
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:35,860
People would open up their home

1171
01:09:36,770 --> 01:09:41,060
because this wasn't like traditional jazz.

1172
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,563
This was art music.

1173
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,740
That was the heyday of the avant-garde,

1174
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:50,793
was the loft jazz scene.

1175
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,943
Real estate in Manhattan changed all of that.

1176
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:01,640
So these lofts were flourishing and I don't think anybody

1177
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,233
was paying more than a hundred dollars a month.

1178
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:08,380
I had a friend who was a real estate lawyer.

1179
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:11,380
He said, you artists come in,

1180
01:10:11,380 --> 01:10:14,480
and you civilize a place with your talent, you know,

1181
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:18,530
whether it be visual arts or theater arts

1182
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:20,380
or musical arts or whatever.

1183
01:10:20,380 --> 01:10:24,670
And the whole area becomes unaffordable to those who

1184
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:26,443
brought this activity about.

1185
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,963
That's what killed the loft jazz scene.

1186
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:40,010
New York was a mystery,

1187
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:42,236
a mystery.

1188
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:46,020
I started to play this kind of music,

1189
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,933
in a different way, obviously.

1190
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:52,880
For me, it's a mystery what I did,

1191
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:54,993
because sometimes I don't think I do it.

1192
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,933
For me, music is everything.

1193
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,460
I don't have barriers.

1194
01:11:11,698 --> 01:11:13,430
It's simple.

1195
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:18,430
I consider myself an international musician

1196
01:11:18,890 --> 01:11:21,493
who plays music.

1197
01:11:23,335 --> 01:11:26,835
(ethereal chimes ringing)

1198
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:35,740
I got influenced by broadcast, East Germany,

1199
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:38,213
at an an age of 11 or 12 years.

1200
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:44,960
And I remember the quality depended always on the weather.

1201
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,223
This was first time I was listening, audibly.

1202
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,413
It was a positive shock for me.

1203
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:03,543
Jazz, you know, during the Nazi time was forbidden.

1204
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:07,500
The stupid Nazis, as Adolf Hitler,

1205
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:09,443
there was no jazz music.

1206
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:13,230
And the Americans, when they had won the war,

1207
01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:17,860
the first Americans I saw were the black GIs.

1208
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:20,217
And so I had my first jam with a black GI,

1209
01:12:20,217 --> 01:12:22,310
when I was eight years old.

1210
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:24,050
They changed my life.

1211
01:12:24,050 --> 01:12:26,620
They come to Europe, they freed me from the Nazis,

1212
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:29,220
have given me this incredible music.

1213
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,630
The situation in Germany, you know,

1214
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:35,640
was so down and people also need

1215
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:40,580
to have a new feeling of life.

1216
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:43,104
We found jazz music.

1217
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:44,760
I mean, if you think about the jazz musicians,

1218
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,890
with the exception of Django Reinhardt, of course,

1219
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:48,250
and a couple of others

1220
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,260
who came along in the 30's and 40's,

1221
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:52,560
they were mostly playing imitation

1222
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,540
of the American players who had toured there.

1223
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:58,520
The avant-garde didn't give you that option.

1224
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,880
And suddenly you could be a European player,

1225
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,980
not a European player, imitating an American player,

1226
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,310
but using your own culture.

1227
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:07,150
Where do you come from?

1228
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:08,453
What is your folk music?

1229
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:13,020
Europeans, we're not obliged you see to play blues.

1230
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,580
And what that means is now,

1231
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:16,150
we can get up here and improvise.

1232
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,400
It doesn't have to swing,

1233
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:19,910
but it is an improvised music

1234
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:22,540
that obviously has roots in jazz,

1235
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:24,380
but we don't have to jump through a certain hoop

1236
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:26,430
so somebody can say, is this jazz or not?

1237
01:13:31,090 --> 01:13:35,130
The Germans were happy with the title of free jazz.

1238
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,770
That was the only period

1239
01:13:36,770 --> 01:13:41,140
the word free jazz had little meaning.

1240
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:43,600
I hated it afterwards.

1241
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,933
But at that time it was like we needed that.

1242
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,253
England was more radical.

1243
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,073
They called it free improvisation.

1244
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,560
The German guys used to call English jazz

1245
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,720
washing machine music,

1246
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,320
playing around, around, around, around in circles.

1247
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:04,720
The Dutch was the most, let's say eclectic.

1248
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,420
We in Holland, we were the treaters or traitors.

1249
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:08,700
We were the motherfuckers.

1250
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:10,223
We still played the blues.

1251
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:14,110
No way England was playing the blues.

1252
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,430
The Dutch seemed to have been more inclusive.

1253
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:18,370
They seem to have been able to take

1254
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,860
from whatever experience they've had.

1255
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:24,230
The English school operated more from a subtractive base

1256
01:14:24,230 --> 01:14:27,410
where we excluded various elements.

1257
01:14:27,410 --> 01:14:31,410
I mean the Dutch thing also includes humorous elements.

1258
01:14:31,410 --> 01:14:32,813
I am a complete fraud.

1259
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:36,333
My piano playing is poor.

1260
01:14:37,630 --> 01:14:41,183
Well, that's all true, but I don't care anymore.

1261
01:14:45,290 --> 01:14:46,220
Good answer.

1262
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,320
In Holland, we were just in between,

1263
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:51,090
I think it has to do with living in a little country.

1264
01:14:51,090 --> 01:14:53,080
Misha Mengelberg and Han had invited me

1265
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:54,330
to do things in Holland.

1266
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:58,120
And they'd asked me about who else is playing in England.

1267
01:14:58,120 --> 01:14:59,443
Who else is interesting?

1268
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,670
So the exchange between the European countries

1269
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:07,330
was always fun, and competition is good,

1270
01:15:07,330 --> 01:15:09,383
and you have to fight on stage.

1271
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,570
That's what I learned from my English colleague,

1272
01:15:12,570 --> 01:15:14,413
or Dutch colleagues,

1273
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,933
be onstage and do your thing.

1274
01:15:42,172 --> 01:15:43,180
The first time I brought someone,

1275
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:44,690
I couldn't believe, you know,

1276
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:48,620
that's a very loud saxophone.

1277
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,893
Yeah, it was a bit special, yeah.

1278
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,210
Han Bennink, a force of nature.

1279
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:57,500
Mister Han Bennink, very famous Dutch drummer.

1280
01:15:57,500 --> 01:16:01,613
Yes, I mean, he is, as everybody knows,

1281
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,533
quite a case.

1282
01:16:03,533 --> 01:16:06,190
People ho see me playing sometimes,

1283
01:16:06,190 --> 01:16:09,500
they think I'm a sort of wild maniac,

1284
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:13,110
but I make only little tiny little lovely things.

1285
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:15,660
The reason we gravitated towards one another

1286
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:18,613
was more to do with the shared attitudes.

1287
01:16:19,570 --> 01:16:21,240
That was more important

1288
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,083
than any sense of national identity, I think.

1289
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:29,043
It's much more about those strong individuals.

1290
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:43,787
Please say hello to Sun Ra.

1291
01:16:43,787 --> 01:16:44,620
This really is special.

1292
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:45,830
(audience applauding and cheering)

1293
01:16:45,830 --> 01:16:49,343
Now who are some of your early influences.

1294
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,963
Well, the planets, the Creator,

1295
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:59,713
mythical gods and real ones, people, flowers,

1296
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,980
everything in nature, my inspiration.

1297
01:17:03,980 --> 01:17:05,260
Musicians get their inspiration

1298
01:17:05,260 --> 01:17:07,710
really from environmental things.

1299
01:17:07,710 --> 01:17:10,250
And all musicians are inspiration to me,

1300
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,240
no matter what style they're playing.

1301
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:14,093
By all means, let's do it.

1302
01:17:14,093 --> 01:17:15,453
Thank you.

1303
01:17:15,453 --> 01:17:19,786
(audience applauding and cheering)

1304
01:17:23,253 --> 01:17:25,060
At that period of time,

1305
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:29,213
there was not a possibility to play in an orchestra.

1306
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:32,330
Sun Ra's orchestra was the only orchestra

1307
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:33,350
you could get into,

1308
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:36,960
and I was very interested in just the whole concept

1309
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:40,427
of playing in a big band and orchestra, you know,

1310
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:41,580
and he was wonderful,

1311
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:44,763
because he wrote a lot of his own music.

1312
01:17:47,660 --> 01:17:48,760
I had an opportunity

1313
01:17:50,990 --> 01:17:52,170
to work with Sun Ra.

1314
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:53,510
I smile because of the fact

1315
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,943
that it was such an incredible experience.

1316
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:00,853
Sun Ra said to me, oh, here.

1317
01:18:03,637 --> 01:18:05,083
He gives me my space suit.

1318
01:18:07,329 --> 01:18:08,890
I wasn't hip to this.

1319
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,983
But he finally convinced me.

1320
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,190
I did not fully understand at that particular time

1321
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:22,883
Sun Ra's philosophy, but I learnt later to understand it.

1322
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:37,450
I liked Sun Ra's band.

1323
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,740
I liked everything that was going on

1324
01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:40,910
musically with the band,

1325
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:43,830
but I didn't like the cult part of the band.

1326
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:47,450
The musicians were great, great players,

1327
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:50,920
but they wouldn't play with nobody else, but Sun Ra.

1328
01:18:50,920 --> 01:18:54,810
Well, he was the first one to really introduce me

1329
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:57,330
in the high forms of music, you know,

1330
01:18:57,330 --> 01:18:59,240
past what you may would say

1331
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:02,050
what Bird and Monk and the fellows were doing.

1332
01:19:02,050 --> 01:19:04,580
I didn't think anybody was ahead of them

1333
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:06,960
until I met Sun Ra, you know.

1334
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,690
See music is a universal language,

1335
01:19:09,690 --> 01:19:11,693
and it represents the people of Earth.

1336
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,140
One day, it will happen

1337
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:17,570
that a voice from another dimension

1338
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:18,743
will speak to Earth.

1339
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:22,740
You might as well practice and be prepared for it.

1340
01:19:22,740 --> 01:19:25,100
Sun Ra was famous for having

1341
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:26,820
raw and rigorous practice sessions.

1342
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,897
Right, we had long sessions.

1343
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,513
Every night, every day,

1344
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:35,310
rehearsal.

1345
01:19:35,310 --> 01:19:39,030
Sun Ra is a perfect example of somebody

1346
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:40,570
who really comes out of left field.

1347
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:41,940
I mean, you can make jokes that he, yeah,

1348
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,500
he comes from another planet, but he, you know,

1349
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,250
he comes from doo-wop for heaven sake.

1350
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,990
He comes from swing.

1351
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:51,180
One point, he played piano with Fletcher Henderson's band.

1352
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,330
He really went back in history,

1353
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:55,580
and he's one of the first guys to use synthesizer,

1354
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:56,830
and electric instruments.

1355
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:01,070
The thing that has made jazz

1356
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:03,260
such an enthralling experience

1357
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,670
for over a hundred years worldwide,

1358
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,913
is that it has never sat still.

1359
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:11,860
My story is not part of history

1360
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:16,450
because history repeats itself.

1361
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:18,363
But my story is endless.

1362
01:20:19,380 --> 01:20:21,740
It never repeats itself.

1363
01:20:21,740 --> 01:20:22,573
Why should it?

1364
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:30,340
As a creative artist, you have some choices.

1365
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,980
You get to be a point where people

1366
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:33,430
are looking to you for music.

1367
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,100
You can go forward,

1368
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,553
if you have any ideas.

1369
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:41,823
If you don't have any ideas, then you go back.

1370
01:20:53,330 --> 01:20:54,860
The forms are very simple here.

1371
01:20:54,860 --> 01:20:58,140
We're talking about 12 bar blues or 32 bars,

1372
01:20:58,140 --> 01:20:59,760
I got rhythm or something.

1373
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,020
To rehash that over and over again,

1374
01:21:02,020 --> 01:21:03,430
it makes me want to regurgitate.

1375
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:04,613
You can't use it, man.

1376
01:21:04,613 --> 01:21:07,840
It's like going back, digging up the dead, man.

1377
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,430
You know, I mean, what validity does it have

1378
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:13,660
with us today, man, from that period?

1379
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,790
It's been done so many times, so well,

1380
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:17,460
that we don't all have to do the same thing

1381
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:18,293
over and over again, you know,

1382
01:21:18,293 --> 01:21:19,853
it's like reinventing the wheel.

1383
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:32,130
It's really almost lost.

1384
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:35,650
I mean, unless it's the musicians themselves,

1385
01:21:35,650 --> 01:21:38,473
some who are aware of that era, nobody else is.

1386
01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:42,630
It's part of the very conservative attitude

1387
01:21:42,630 --> 01:21:45,390
towards new art and new expression,

1388
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:46,990
and new ways of expressing yourself.

1389
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:50,990
If somebody wants to keep forms of expression,

1390
01:21:50,990 --> 01:21:53,420
so tied up, it's unhealthy.

1391
01:21:53,420 --> 01:21:56,750
And it's not for the betterment of the society.

1392
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:00,010
And then you have messengers,

1393
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:01,710
your creative people,

1394
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:04,813
that define the language in a different way.

1395
01:22:06,263 --> 01:22:08,560
It's all about creativity.

1396
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,220
And the history of the greatest players

1397
01:22:11,220 --> 01:22:13,923
has always been about taking the music forward,

1398
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:17,440
fighting between this camp and that camp.

1399
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,910
It doesn't make sense.

1400
01:22:18,910 --> 01:22:20,170
It's all one music.

1401
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:21,533
We're all in this.

1402
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:25,730
We need to be stronger than ever with the music.

1403
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:27,890
Because I think it's a good time now man.

1404
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:30,610
What's happening with the politics is going on.

1405
01:22:30,610 --> 01:22:31,620
What's happening with the country?

1406
01:22:31,620 --> 01:22:33,032
How screwed up the country is,

1407
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,380
the administration that we have.

1408
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,950
For a long time, I thought that,

1409
01:22:39,950 --> 01:22:41,680
very naive I suppose on my part,

1410
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:44,050
that something as vital as jazz music

1411
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,203
would sort of take care of itself.

1412
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:50,800
Somebody has to sort of help jazz stay in focus.

1413
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,133
I don't know who that is.

1414
01:22:53,550 --> 01:22:55,360
A guy like Ornette Coleman doesn't come along

1415
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,080
every five years, or Charlie Parker,

1416
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:59,343
or John Coltrane.

1417
01:23:01,450 --> 01:23:02,650
Maybe the next guy

1418
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:07,030
is about 10 now, right?

1419
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,000
Runny nose kid,

1420
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,710
out playing basketball on the blacktop now.

1421
01:23:10,710 --> 01:23:12,260
That'll be our next big Jazzer.

1422
01:23:22,674 --> 01:23:25,841
(ethereal jazz music)

1423
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:58,273
(crowd murmuring)

1424
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,730
When you hear music after it's over,

1425
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:11,570
it's gone in the air.

1426
01:27:11,570 --> 01:27:13,543
You can never capture it again.
