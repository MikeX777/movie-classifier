1
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,570
Watch out!

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,100
No

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,479
Oh my God, oh my God

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,280
It's nothing

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,430
Yes, it's something

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,230
It holds

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,040
Stop it

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,590
Stop it or I leave

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,440
Stop it, please

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,199
There's a tier below, don't be afraid

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,230
Please

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,410
That's the point

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,640
If I die?

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,840
Sorry?

15
00:00:37,841 --> 00:00:38,399
If I die?

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,842
Then I die after you

17
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:42,999
That's the point, I don't want to die,
so don't die, come

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,460
Come!

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,350
Come!

20
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,620
Come fetch me

21
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,199
You managed to go there, you manage
to come back - No that's not true

22
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,830
Coming

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
Please, come back, please, I beg of you

24
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,731
Look, I never kneeled

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,959
There, I'm out of my home

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,350
so come home

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,850
At last I get you back

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,190
You don't have to be afraid

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,710
Yes I have to

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,400
For this semester's end:

31
00:01:53,435 --> 00:01:56,965
Virginity in Maghreb

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,600
Premarital sexuality
Modern life and respect of the traditions

33
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:11,960
Possible topics for my video reportage

34
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:12,961
Virginity in Maghreb
Difficulty to be a man

35
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:13,962
Premarital sexuality
Modern life and respect of the traditions

36
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,000
And now, our reportage on the forms

37
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,000
of homosexual unions

38
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:20,000
continues with an exclusive
interview of Abdellah Taïa

39
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:21,391
writer born in Rabat

40
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:25,199
who just published his first book.

41
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,400
Abdellah Taïa, do you think
a form of civil union

42
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:30,000
could be legalised in Maghreb by Muhammad VI

43
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,400
or President Ben Ali?

44
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,151
Civil union...

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, it's not my...

46
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,129
I don't know what I ought to answer...

47
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,119
and what I would like...

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
but I don't think this will happen

49
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:42,771
someday in Morocco

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,720
but...

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,060
we do have better

52
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,290
rather we had better

53
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,690
It was marriage between nmen

54
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,960
in the oasis of Siwa

55
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,280
which is in Egypt

56
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,999
just near the libyan border

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,120
there was, till the middle of XX century

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
weddings between men

59
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:07,400
More exactly, it was a specific social class

60
00:03:07,401 --> 00:03:08,720
which was called "Eggallah"

61
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,400
they were workers

62
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:12,000
for the wealthy in Siwa

63
00:03:12,001 --> 00:03:16,199
and, as they couldn't wed
before they were 40

64
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,400
they had the opportunity

65
00:03:17,401 --> 00:03:19,201
to marry youths

66
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,399
15, 16, 18, something like that

67
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,999
so they proposed to the family

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,400
they gave a dowry

69
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,591
they a wedding was celebrated

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,399
As there was a lot of palm trees

71
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,799
they devote themselves to some practice

72
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:39,399
They let their sensuality,
their male sensitivity, express itself

73
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,550
dancing an singing

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,399
You have to know that, at night,

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,720
the best way to have fun is to dance.

76
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,350
Oh yes, I saw a clip, in Algeria

77
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,440
What's her name, Britters...

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,401
Britney Spears

79
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:02,502
Yes, her

80
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,599
she was dancing with a mini skirt

81
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,200
it's censored, down there

82
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:08,201
They cut it?

83
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:08,602
Yeah

84
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:09,943
I swear

85
00:04:10,204 --> 00:04:11,399
It's a religious country

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,320
I don't think so

87
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
You go in the bushes

88
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,799
You find Muslim Sisters

89
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,399
and that's what they are doing

90
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,980
Nowadays, for them

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,860
twiddling in the bushes

92
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,451
or someplace

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,279
it's normal

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,840
it's normal, yes

95
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,000
And above all, don't touch...

96
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,301
vagina, or...

97
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,159
So that's hanky-panky

98
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,399
No it isn't, far from it

99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,950
it's a form of homosexuality

100
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,540
yes, from behind

101
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,949
the boy gets his own pleasure

102
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,980
the girl make do

103
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,380
it's a pity

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,790
If you think those people...

105
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,199
they are constrained to do it

106
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,390
so you got many frustrated people

107
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:24,280
Ethnic an gay tea dance
Every Sunday - Black, White, and Coloured

108
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,199
Why are they late?

109
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,660
Yeah?

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,200
Can I speak to you for a moment?

111
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:36,121
Yeah, go on

112
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:37,592
It's just to ask you...

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
I'm doing something about...

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,920
I've problems finding guys who'll...

115
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,210
join my reportage

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
What kind of reportage?

117
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,721
It's...

118
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,400
It's a sociology topic
for my school, I have...

119
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:55,031
to interview gays from...

120
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:59,049
Why are you asking me? I'm not gay!

121
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,449
No, no insult intended

122
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,799
No, you come to me...

123
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
but it's not because I'm there
on a Sunday that...

124
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:06,999
No, I don't want to have
anything to do with your trick

125
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
No, it's no trick...

126
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,791
No, that' all

127
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,030
Hey... wait!

128
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,611
No, I can't, I told you

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,110
To submit your ad, please wait...

130
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,010
Hello

131
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,399
I call for your ad in the papers

132
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:43,199
I'm much interested,
and I'm OK to be screened

133
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
for an interview

134
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,199
You are?

135
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,200
Karim

136
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,370
Hi

137
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,050
I wasn't sure

138
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,799
I almost knocked at the other door

139
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,430
Oh yes?

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,020
Make yourself confortable, take a chair

141
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,999
It looks like good equipment

142
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,240
That's my parent's,
for holidays, and everything

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,079
So you're Tunisian

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
You did watch some practices...

145
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:30,341
homosexual practices down there

146
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,919
What differences have you noticed with here?

147
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,999
What can I say?

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,999
Don't you want us to speak more of myself,
my personal experience?

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,920
Yeah, go on

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,199
Actually, I'm a performer

151
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,999
I work mainly with my body

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,719
Artworks take place on my body

153
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,199
Explain

154
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,810
You see, I get naked

155
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,199
and I ask a man to make a drawing
with henna on my skin

156
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,990
on the spot he wants

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,399
Afterward, I ask him to take pictures of me

158
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:01,199
So, I become a living sculpture for the man
who let his mark on my body

159
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,230
a living sculpture, existing till
the henna disappears

160
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,399
But... what's the connection
with you homosexuality?

161
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:09,800
In fact

162
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,199
it's often Maghrebin people

163
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,890
as yourself

164
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,190
with whom I make love

165
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,999
I want my lovers to make an artwork with me

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,910
and it can be heterosexual people, too

167
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,980
You know what?

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,919
I've never filmed my performance

169
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,799
Would you like me to become your artwork?

170
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,840
So I'll strip

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,719
I'll bring my syringe

172
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,680
and you'll make a drawing on me

173
00:09:33,681 --> 00:09:35,279
Don't worry, it'll be quick

174
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,350
Would you open the door, please?

175
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,799
You'll do your artwork without me

176
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,360
Listen, I'm...

177
00:09:41,361 --> 00:09:42,741
That's not the topic.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,040
Stop laughing

179
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,399
Do you think there is...

180
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,600
a homosexual algerian identity?

181
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:01,599
I don't know, I'm sorry

182
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,599
I don't know well since

183
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,200
it's been a while since I went in Algeria.

184
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,999
due to the problems.

185
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,799
Last time I went,

186
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
I was 17 or 18

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,270
From my innocent view, I saw homosexuality

188
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,560
without knowing what it is really.

189
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,999
The thing is, people flirted with me

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,799
I thought it was only a contact

191
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,730
a contact between algerians

192
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,519
I know arab contacts are very strong

193
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,839
one holds hands

194
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,870
have some kisses

195
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,820
I think in Maghreb,

196
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,320
a great lot of people are homosexual

197
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,470
But some do it because they like it

198
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,960
others do it short term,

199
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,700
during boyhood

200
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,599
and then, they marry

201
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,399
Was it a burden for you,
when you were young?

202
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,900
I knew it quite lately

203
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,010
lately?

204
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,060
three years ago

205
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,199
and during these three years,
I spend two with somebody

206
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,599
I'm quite faithful, so I stayed with
this person, without questionning

207
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,599
I fell in love with him.

208
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,510
It's over for a year, so now

209
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,820
I enjoy parisian nights

210
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,390
you understand?

211
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,799
Which country do you like most?

212
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,799
Certainly Egypt

213
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,020
Join the club

214
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,999
But you don't know it

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,280
Egypt? No.

216
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,190
No, but sensitivity and...

217
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,599
I don't know, but the way
guys sing down there

218
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,799
It's sensitive, it's romantic

219
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,599
Perhaps romantic isn't appropriate word,
but it's sensitive, they aren't afraid to...

220
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,910
they don't fear to express themselves

221
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,510
That's... it a way I appreciate

222
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,730
Oriental music...
it's a sensitive music generally

223
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,590
Very sensitive

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,199
And I feel, I'm sure you dance quite well

225
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,390
What makes you say that?

226
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,260
I don't know

227
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,430
We've got time

228
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,799
You could dance for me

229
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,599
you owe me that much

230
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,350
Sure

231
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,430
You could do...

232
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,399
You could show me

233
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,020
how well you dance

234
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,020
I do dance, but...

235
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,490
only for myself

236
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,370
Well Ok

237
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,240
I hope you'll be able to help me because...

238
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,599
till now, the testimonies I got weren't

239
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,999
very deep or interesting

240
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
Actually, I don't know
if I can suggest something

241
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,199
really interesting...

242
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,639
What I'll do is...

243
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,839
I'll present you...

244
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,640
a few member's addresses

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,199
Say you come from me, it's important

246
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,599
Are they all gay?

247
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,940
Yes, all of them, without exception

248
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,799
as are most members of our association

249
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,430
aside a few heteros

250
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,199
who joined us, funny

251
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,279
Those I selected are serious

252
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,720
no problem

253
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,399
They are willing to be filmed openly

254
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,599
as we agreed on the phone.

255
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,930
Otherwise, I've an interesting contact

256
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,690
an association called ADRIS

257
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,740
who fights for clandestine gays

258
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,799
At the moment, they see to a maghrebin

259
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,940
an algerian who flew his country

260
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,800
who's refugee in France, for the moment.

261
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:33,801
My name's Mohamed

262
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:36,312
I'm gay, I'm algerian

263
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,399
I was born in Algiers, I'm 27

264
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,000
Homosexuality is a highbrow term in Algeria

265
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:43,199
people can't understand

266
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,399
what it means

267
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,599
When you are told "homosexual"

268
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,999
especially people who didn't go to school

269
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
they can't understand

270
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,399
people only say

271
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,599
gay,, for them, it's not...

272
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
beware, it's an insult

273
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:56,999
when you say, it's somebody

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,799
well,, it means, it's somebody

275
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,879
who's "in his ass"

276
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,999
who gets fucked

277
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,140
but it's not for someone

278
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,599
who fucks, because the one who fucks...

279
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,999
...is a macho, a true man

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,799
despite he fucks, he's still seen as a man

281
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,199
I would say, he's accepted

282
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,940
despite he's wicked

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,399
he's still respected

284
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,199
that is, his authority is respected

285
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,199
he pass

286
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,810
so society won't reject him

287
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,399
or won't be ostracised

288
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,799
they may wipe it away

289
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,399
but somebody who gets fucked

290
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,780
he got...

291
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,199
not only he gets fucked, but

292
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,800
he gets... all the bad jobs to do.

293
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:39,601
so it's important

294
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,599
It's passive homosexuality,
I insist, passive...

295
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,000
homosexuality who's condemned.

296
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:06,970
How are you?

297
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,950
7 floors!

298
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,060
Sorry

299
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,820
Do you like me fat,
ou do you want me to slim?

300
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,000
Thanks

301
00:16:24,601 --> 00:16:25,999
Take a smoke, if you like

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,799
Oh, I got some, for once

303
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,199
But they come from America

304
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,401
so they are "deesgusting"

305
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:32,142
Yes, as at home

306
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,599
See, "deesgusting"

307
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,480
"deesgusting"

308
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,199
How are you going?

309
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,980
Well, I was viewing my film

310
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,510
Hey, I've something for you

311
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,480
Look, your double

312
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,010
It'll look good with your pic, yonder

313
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,420
Michelangeli

314
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,050
Good, my gazelle

315
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,799
As soon as I saw the colors, they seemed...

316
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,510
Funny, the expression is the same

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,200
You could believe you did it on purpose

318
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,591
the same position

319
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:22,999
I think the drawer made it on purpose

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
He copied me

321
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,961
He copied your facial expression

322
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,810
It's nice, isn't it?

323
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,460
Actually, it makes an axis

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,999
symmetry
- Like a couple that...

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,150
I cheated on you

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,799
There you go! I knew,
going and coming from Algeria...

327
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,999
But she's no algerian

328
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,180
No, we knew her like you before

329
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,750
For the green card, right

330
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,600
But I had her put a veil, otherwise...

331
00:17:57,601 --> 00:18:00,841
True, with a face like that,
it has to be the green card

332
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:03,852
Well, I saw this pic, it's beautiful

333
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,570
Hi, Karim, I'm in transit in Mykonos
I just visited the island of Delos

334
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:48,430
I wish you could film me here. I like being
in front of cameras, especially yours. Farid.

335
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,410
Hi, Farid, Karim speaking

336
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,650
I want to thank you for the pics

337
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,630
They're lovely. If you want to
see them, just call me back.

338
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm busy just now

339
00:19:13,001 --> 00:19:15,201
I changed at the airport

340
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,970
so you can come right now, if you like

341
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,765
I see you ran

342
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,600
Back from your journey?

343
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,601
Yeah, I arrived just now

344
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,600
How come you're sweating so much?

345
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:28,965
It's quite hot outside

346
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,600
Yes, but that much, though...

347
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,200
What?

348
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,000
That much?

349
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
You're from the countryside, no?

350
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
It's so high, you have to
deserve climbing to you

351
00:19:37,601 --> 00:19:38,601
Wanna have a shower,
before I show you the pics?

352
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
Just a fresh T-shirt, so...

353
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
Ah shit, I suggest a shower,
you ask for a T-shirt

354
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:52,201
Either one, you don't mind?

355
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,200
Yeah, never mind

356
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Is it OK?

357
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,001
Yeah, fine

358
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Want something to drink?

359
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,400
Whatever, as long as I drink

360
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:09,801
OK

361
00:20:10,202 --> 00:20:12,000
Since you ran, water will be fine

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Where are you changing?

363
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Wow, what a man!

364
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:38,400
Don't get excited, please

365
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:42,800
Karim

366
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,400
Tequila, or...

367
00:20:49,441 --> 00:20:49,841
Yeah

368
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,602
Tequila

369
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,003
Alcohol is bad.

370
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,400
I like bad things

371
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,000
I stop, you must be thirsty

372
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,000
Alcohol is bad, but you seem to have a lot

373
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
I entertain a lot

374
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,400
You know how to entertain

375
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
I have to, people must feel at ease

376
00:21:11,401 --> 00:21:12,001
Thanks

377
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,000
You fell alright by me?

378
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,600
Health

379
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,800
Stop it

380
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,000
Are you uneasy?

381
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,000
Well, I don't know

382
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Don't be afraid, I won't jump on you

383
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,400
So are you showing me these pics?

384
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
I look well, don't I?

385
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Yes, you look good on video

386
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,600
Thanks

387
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,200
You too, you look good

388
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,600
Yes, but I don't get filmed.

389
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Your turn will come

390
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,600
Inch'Allah, as one say.

391
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,400
Inch'Allah

392
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes, I hear you

393
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,600
Ciao

394
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
- Bye
- Bye

395
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,565
See you

396
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Call me as soon...

397
00:22:29,601 --> 00:22:30,601
- Call me whenever you like
- Fine

398
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,400
Karim, for the interview,
I wish to go to the Calanques

399
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:03,001
at a naturist spot. Don't be afraid,
nothing's going to happen to you

400
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
No trap

401
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
but I wish to go there, I like the place.

402
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,000
You introduce yourself ahead of my camera

403
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,000
It will perhaps be showed to students

404
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
things like that

405
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Doesn't it bother you?

406
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,200
Of course it does

407
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:20,601
But I think I'm above that

408
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:22,200
regarding my ho...

409
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,000
my sexuality, plainly

410
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:25,600
I'm above that

411
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
Yes, I had problems, like

412
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,200
identity problems regarding

413
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
my culture and...

414
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,200
my origins, therefore my sexuality too

415
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,400
but it's going on

416
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,600
So long as I assume, myself,
it's going fairly well with others

417
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,400
It would be more difficult
telling my mother I eat pork

418
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:45,401
than I am gay

419
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:46,402
- Oh yeah?
- Yes

420
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
- Does your mother know?
- Yes, she does

421
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,400
Did she take it well?

422
00:23:49,601 --> 00:23:50,401
No!

423
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
But she knows

424
00:23:52,601 --> 00:23:53,401
- She knows
- Yes

425
00:23:53,402 --> 00:23:55,400
Karim, I warn you, I'm going to strip

426
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:56,601
I hope it won't upset you

427
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,400
Why don't you strip?

428
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Because I'm modest.

429
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,400
Do you want help spreading
lotion on your back

430
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you stay there?

431
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:15,401
Yes

432
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,600
I go strolling

433
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
I can't hear you, who's that?

434
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,400
Hello

435
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,800
OK, I hear better, now

436
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,000
OK, now I know who it is

437
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:43,000
bacause I couldn't hear you,
it went "trbbshhh"

438
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,000
Where are you?

439
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
What did you say?

440
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,400
WHere are you?

441
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,165
It's up to you

442
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
call me when you come back in Paris

443
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,400
or we arrange a appointment just now

444
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,400
if you like, eh, only if you want to see me

445
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,600
I ask you, if you like,
if you have something to do

446
00:27:21,801 --> 00:27:25,000
perhaps you don't feel like it, you'd like to
stay... I don't know, that's why I ask you

447
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,200
OK, fine, you call me back

448
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,000
So, is you book going fine?

449
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,001
I don't know

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,600
Of course, hanging around backrooms...

451
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,400
- I've no means to know, and moreover...
- Why?

452
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,000
Because I've to ask the publisher,
ask the bookshops, and...

453
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,400
On the other side, there's been
no review, nothing

454
00:28:01,801 --> 00:28:02,401
Silence

455
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,365
That's good, but...

456
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,200
But people who know you, who've read
the book, how do they see you?

457
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
As a freak, as before

458
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
Even you say quite often I'm a freak

459
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,000
Stop thanks

460
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,800
- Go on, help yourself.
- Thanks, I'm not hungry

461
00:28:21,801 --> 00:28:24,000
I actually came to see you

462
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:25,001
not to eat.

463
00:28:25,002 --> 00:28:26,002
That's soja

464
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,203
Did you ear me?

465
00:28:27,204 --> 00:28:28,204
Go on, eat!

466
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,400
Do you assume your homosexuality,
compared with before?

467
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,401
No, I don't

468
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:34,402
- Still not.
- No

469
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,600
It hurts me

470
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,200
Every time I ejaculate, I cry

471
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,800
and do you wash afterward, as before?

472
00:28:44,001 --> 00:28:44,801
No, I don't do it anymore

473
00:28:45,002 --> 00:28:46,400
You know, I'm making a reportage...

474
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,000
on homosexuality, right now

475
00:28:49,001 --> 00:28:50,001
Would you like to...

476
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,800
participate.

477
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Do you make movies, now?

478
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I begin to.

479
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,600
You've done everything

480
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,800
At 15, you were in politics

481
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,800
What's the them of your film?

482
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Homosexuality in Maghreb

483
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,000
For me, what's important is...

484
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,800
to drop these questions right now

485
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,800
I mean in my life

486
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
and everybody's life.

487
00:29:13,401 --> 00:29:15,400
There're two questions I don't ask myself

488
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:16,600
but I understand people who...

489
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
ask themselves when they are 20...

490
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
20, 25 years old

491
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
That's homosexuality and origins.

492
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Homosexuality and origins,
it a final question

493
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
Yourself, how do you stand
towards sexuality?

494
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,800
Sexuality?

495
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
I stand... as an heterosexual

496
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,560
But that's a bit strange

497
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,800
you make a movie on that
when you stand as an hetero

498
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:52,400
Sociology is studying society

499
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,400
Yes, but one chooses a subjet

500
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,600
chooses a subject in relation
with one's interests

501
00:29:56,601 --> 00:29:57,601
in relation with...

502
00:29:57,602 --> 00:30:00,800
do you feel personally concerned,
in this work...

503
00:30:01,001 --> 00:30:01,801
in this task?

504
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,800
That's a theme that hasn't been covered yet

505
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:05,800
You mean your film...

506
00:30:06,001 --> 00:30:08,200
you apply sociologic methods

507
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,800
to a documentary?

508
00:30:11,801 --> 00:30:14,400
I don't apply anything. I light up a light.

509
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,400
Light keeps eroticism out, tight?

510
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,700
Does it suits you...

511
00:30:22,735 --> 00:30:23,800
this interview?

512
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,000
Yes, it's fine with me

513
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,000
because it's important

514
00:30:29,001 --> 00:30:31,200
I know another guy who's working

515
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,200
on that subject, too

516
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,000
on Homosexuality in Maghreb

517
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,000
I think it's his film's title

518
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,001
Homosexuality in Maghreb

519
00:30:38,202 --> 00:30:40,600
Funny, I saw you at the same time

520
00:30:40,601 --> 00:30:43,000
I thought you worked together

521
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:44,001
but you don't know him at all.

522
00:30:44,602 --> 00:30:45,400
What's his name?

523
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,400
Farid?

524
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, speaking

525
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,600
Yes, I'm fine

526
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,360
What do I mean, could you come, just now?

527
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,400
What's that?

528
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,600
You know quite well, it's my number

529
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,200
Do you know who gave it to me?

530
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:01,401
Oh yes, I've got an idea

531
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,600
You've got an idea

532
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:03,201
Yeah

533
00:31:03,602 --> 00:31:04,800
And what were you doing with him?

534
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:05,801
It's a friend

535
00:31:06,002 --> 00:31:06,802
It's a friend whom you filmed

536
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:07,803
So what?

537
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
So what, you're doing a film about
homosexuality in Maghreb, he told me

538
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
Oh, there, cool down, that's it

539
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,960
You don't offer me a drink,
where's hospitality?

540
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,600
Well, I go to see someone,
you go before me, you... tell me!

541
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Think some.

542
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Think what?

543
00:31:24,001 --> 00:31:25,600
You interviewed him the day before me

544
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,565
But, Karim

545
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,165
No, you tell me

546
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,765
if you're doing a movie

547
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,300
You thought the idea is good

548
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:32,800
You wish to do it in my stead

549
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,200
Do you mean what you say?

550
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,800
No I don't mean it, I'm playing Shakespeare

551
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:39,800
But I did it only for you

552
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,400
that's it

553
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That's for you

554
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,800
- Is it your interview?
- Yes

555
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,400
But why did you do it?

556
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,401
For you

557
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,400
Why, to help me doing it?

558
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,800
May I have a drink, now?

559
00:32:02,801 --> 00:32:03,801
I don't want it

560
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,802
What do you have?

561
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,800
Tea

562
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I'll heat up some water

563
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:11,561
But next time, warn me, I don't like...

564
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:13,400
I didn't want to disturb you,
I meant to surprise you

565
00:32:13,401 --> 00:32:15,400
It's my first present. There will be more.

566
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:17,201
But it peeves me.
I've difficulties to find people

567
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:18,400
so if you take them as I find them...

568
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:19,601
Well, don't speak of it anymore

569
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
Your posters are fine

570
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
Ah, Farid el Atrache

571
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm called Farid after him

572
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,000
Good music, good dance

573
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,000
What question did you ask him?

574
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,001
You'll see

575
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:34,800
In the new town of Marrakesh

576
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
near the great post office

577
00:32:36,035 --> 00:32:37,400
where boys, at night,

578
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
dress as women

579
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,800
get feminine forenames

580
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,400
and wait there for a boy

581
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
wishing to... fuck them

582
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
It's why they are...

583
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Thanks

584
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,600
You're welcome

585
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,000
No, I mean

586
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,800
A bit aggressive, no?

587
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,565
Unbelievable

588
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,000
- I didn't know you that way
- You're not angry?

589
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:01,600
No, frankly, no

590
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,600
Thanks

591
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
As an apology

592
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,600
Hey, I did my best!

593
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,400
I know, I'm patient

594
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,200
Why aren't you in your film?

595
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,200
Because it has no interest,
I'm not a homo...

596
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,400
I don't want to be filmed
just because I'm a beur

597
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,400
Stop it

598
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
But it's so small

599
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:39,001
You want to try?

600
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,800
Karim

601
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Honestly, did you ever sleep
with another man?

602
00:33:43,401 --> 00:33:44,401
No!

603
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,000
Siam and you are going well together

604
00:33:50,001 --> 00:33:52,000
I mean, sexually, for example?

605
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:52,801
Very well, yes

606
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:54,002
Will you marry together?

607
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
- Do we wish to marry?
- Yes

608
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:57,801
We're speaking of it but...

609
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,000
I'm quite far from a decision

610
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,600
After marriage, for instance

611
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,600
...if you marry
- Yes

612
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,800
you realised that, all in all,
it doesn't suits you, and...

613
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,200
you fake love

614
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,400
what will you do?

615
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,600
Everything my poor heart wants to say

616
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
You are now my master

617
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,000
not knowing what to do with you

618
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,000
if I had bad intentions

619
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,200
because I'm good and kind, as God made me

620
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,200
I dvise love and innocent laughing

621
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,000
But this has no incidence on your life

622
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,800
because it's too locked up, so God made it.

623
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,200
I'll cover you with tender love

624
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,200
I will hurt you only with cuddles

625
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
if you were warmer and more relaxed

626
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,800
if you were less cold and distant

627
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
we could enjoy good moments

628
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
that will stay in our memories.

629
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,400
Hi Karim

630
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:24,000
I write to you from Amsterdam, where I went
to visit my friend, the photographer

631
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,600
I took the oportunity to search

632
00:35:27,635 --> 00:35:30,000
for a possible gay mosque

633
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,800
I tried to call arab groups,
who could be interested.

634
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,800
I called several times, to no avail.

635
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,000
So I went to the Gay Documentation Center

636
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,600
there, I found documents which
could be of interest for you

637
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
I made copies for you

638
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,000
Eventually, I got in touch with one of the
gay group, called Yussef Foundation

639
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,400
That's what they said:

640
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,400
I don't want to establish a gay mosque,
the turkish group had that idea

641
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,200
They wished to benefit from a turkish imam

642
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,800
who came to Netherland,
and get back to his country

643
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,000
The aim of Yussef Foundation isn't radical,
we just try to change mentalities

644
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,200
inside muslim communities, and to create
a research group within Islam

645
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,200
to study an acceptance pattern of homosexuality,
so that Imams learn to confront the idea

646
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,600
We don't seek revolution, only evolution

647
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
That's it, I'll try to find a camera
to shoot both groups.

648
00:36:24,635 --> 00:36:26,600
without any guarantee. See you. Mustapha

649
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,000
I hav to go to a photographer.
Do you want to come with me?

650
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:32,800
What kind of photos?

651
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,200
Photos for a casting

652
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,400
I've a lot of addresses.
Moreover, they are looking for...

653
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
young english-speaking arabs
for a feature length

654
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,400
and since you speak english, so...

655
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,200
But I don't want to become an actor.

656
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,800
Why, are you afraid of your body?

657
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,600
I've to shoot closer

658
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,400
like that

659
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,800
yes, very good, don't move

660
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,200
yes, super

661
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,000
you know, the difficulty for the photographer
is to resist being carried away, by himself...

662
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,800
or by his model

663
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,900
He has to resist the desire to shoot

664
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,867
until the craving is so irresitible

665
00:37:13,902 --> 00:37:15,800
he can't do otherwise but shoot

666
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Yes, very good

667
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Yeah

668
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,800
Don't move away

669
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,400
Yeah. I manage quite well
with men, doing nothing

670
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,600
Yes, there, there, don't move

671
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,400
Good! Oh well

672
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,800
Yes, super, super, super, don't move away

673
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,800
Beautiful!

674
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,800
Wow

675
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
7 o'clock Place Clichy, did you say?

676
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,600
Half past 7 at La Chapelle, OK

677
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,800
OK?

678
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,200
Is it OK?

679
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,800
It's always happening to me

680
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
As soon as somebody is,
even slightly, disturbed

681
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,600
God send him to me. Psychologist on duty

682
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,000
You have the lawyer for the poors,
and I am psychologist on duty

683
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,800
I've something to fulfil

684
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,400
which will certainly go
through music and dance

685
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,400
but I can't explain... the relation with...

686
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,000
if it'll continue, I don't know

687
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,800
I've enough with guys who
don't know what they want,

688
00:38:35,835 --> 00:38:37,000
where they are.

689
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,200
I have to consult a real psychologist

690
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,800
Hi, it's Farid

691
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,800
Listen, I just land

692
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,400
and I'm fine

693
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,000
could we see each other?

694
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,400
I've something to...

695
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,000
- You're OK?
- Jet lag.

696
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,400
Did you film anybody, meantime

697
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,800
What are you reading, Jean Genet?

698
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,000
Yes, Jean Genet's life

699
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,000
Listen, I'm quite tired

700
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,800
I can understand

701
00:39:06,835 --> 00:39:07,565
I'm tired

702
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,200
strip your jacket, why don't you...

703
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I don't dare, I'm so shy

704
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
You, shy?

705
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,565
Isn't Siam here?

706
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,800
No, she's out for a stroll

707
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Damn, it's a book

708
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,000
"Do you love me?"

709
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
"When I saw this sweet young man

710
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
"He was laughing out

711
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,400
"We were both

712
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
"alone with God

713
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
"However, he put his hand in mine

714
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,800
"and talked a lot

715
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,200
"then he asked me 'Do you love me?'

716
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,400
"Yes, beyond love"

717
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,000
Wow

718
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,200
Arabs are so good

719
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,600
"For you this book
of persian poems

720
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:53,165
"As for my dedication

721
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,765
"Jean Genet will do it in my stead

722
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
"Farid, who cares for you"
- Why a camera here?

723
00:39:56,835 --> 00:39:58,000
Did you interview somebody?

724
00:39:58,035 --> 00:39:59,800
No, I put it there...

725
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,000
to shoot me dancing.

726
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,600
Could you show me some?

727
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
May I take a shower?

728
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,200
I go lying down there

729
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,600
Make yourself at home, you didn't forget!

730
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
But I feel at home here.

731
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I don't mind, do as you please.

732
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Do you keep your promises?

733
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:41,965
What?

734
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
Do you usually keep your promises?

735
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,800
Sure. What about?

736
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,800
Massage, for instance.

737
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,800
Massage?

738
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,000
You told me you would massage me.

739
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:53,600
Did I?

740
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,600
I didn't speak of massage.

741
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,600
That's my spare keys,
come whenever you like.

742
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,000
These two dainty little hands!

743
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:25,800
Oh there you go

744
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:26,517
It's cute

745
00:42:26,552 --> 00:42:27,200
Ah back off

746
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:27,800
Stop it

747
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,000
Ah! "Mouk"

748
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,000
"Mouk"!

749
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,400
You wanna play

750
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,200
Stop fooling aroud

751
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:35,800
Stop it

752
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,800
If you do it again, I overthrow that

753
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,200
Stop it

754
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,000
You bastard!

755
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,400
OK, let's stop together

756
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,600
I did that when I was 10, are you mad?

757
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,400
I blessed you, you won't be gay anymore

758
00:43:06,435 --> 00:43:07,200
I'll cruise you

759
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,000
You got an rendezvous... love?

760
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,200
Yes. Are you jealous, do you want to go with me
Do you want to see how it is between gays?

761
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,000
- Between men?
- Yes

762
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,400
I'd like to see that, yes

763
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,600
Ah but you have to pay for it. Be laid down.

764
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,000
Are you top or bottom?

765
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,400
- I will top or bottom you!
- Oh I begin to learn

766
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,200
Where did you learn these words? Honestly?

767
00:43:27,235 --> 00:43:28,400
Top bottom?

768
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Do you loiter in the Marais, now?

769
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,600
No, I don't

770
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
That makes them believe
it's a cruising trick

771
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,600
But you've got a way to kindle people

772
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:40,400
I mean, when you look...

773
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,600
you kindle

774
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,000
- Me?
- You know quite well

775
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
You're kindling yourselves,
as soon as you see me, you ogle

776
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:47,800
Star!

777
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,000
Who do you take you for?

778
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,200
You loiter gay places, you look like a gay

779
00:43:55,235 --> 00:43:56,800
you ogle like a gay

780
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,965
and you're dressed as a gay

781
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,600
I'm sorry, I'm not dressed as a gay

782
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,800
You're a faggot... a fag-got

783
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,800
And the faggot sneers at you

784
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,200
Yes you do!

785
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,000
- Are you bottoming, tonight
- Of course...

786
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,400
I'm fed up toping

787
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,800
Oh yes, with Siam

788
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,200
Yes, you must be loose,
now, it doesn't appeal to me

789
00:44:17,235 --> 00:44:18,200
I'm no bottom

790
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,600
You're not a bottom?

791
00:44:19,635 --> 00:44:20,200
No

792
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,000
you'd like me to be, he, bitch

793
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,400
You'd like me to be a bottom

794
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,200
You're a kindler

795
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,600
Shit, that's for me

796
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
Hurry up, your lovers're there

797
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,600
Top!

798
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:36,800
Do you have gel?

799
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,600
- Gel?
- Do you have any gel?

800
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:41,800
I put some in my hair,
what are you thinking about?

801
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Seriously, ask him if I may come

802
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Oh he's hot, you're
a lucky man to have Farid

803
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,160
he's so hot

804
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:49,200
Don't listen to him

805
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,000
He's plain silly

806
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,400
I'm not silly, I love sex

807
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,800
At the end you open your ass with...

808
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,800
Are you stuck? It's not entirely inside?

809
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,200
It's too big. That's why. Piss off.

810
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
You're a loose hole, that's it

811
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,000
Yes, he only speaks sex. He's crazy

812
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And he claims he's not gay

813
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,400
Stop it with your little shitty taboos

814
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,800
What's the meaning of all that

815
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,700
Of course you get butt-fucked

816
00:45:25,735 --> 00:45:27,400
its looses up, it dilates

817
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:30,000
- So, we meet at your place, boulevard
Voltaire - Can you turn around, please?

818
00:45:30,035 --> 00:45:31,400
I wanna light up my cigarette

819
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,000
He's jealous. He's jealous, that's why, it's because
he's in love with me, that's why he's like that

820
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Give me a cigarette, Siam

821
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:58,800
Give me one, go on

822
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,600
Hey, what's your problem?

823
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,400
You wanna say something, what's that
how come you throw me that pack

824
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
can't you give it normally,
as normal people do

825
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:11,800
I have to say I exist

826
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,965
You have to talk, there is something
you have to say, speak up!

827
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,200
You don't do motions like that, if you want
to play such motions, I'll show you how I play

828
00:46:17,235 --> 00:46:18,600
you're gonna regret what you've just done

829
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,600
I'll show you who's the gentle sex

830
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,000
I can't believe it, you ask for a cigarette,
she becomes crazy

831
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,200
WHat's the problem, where's your problem
you haven't spoken for days

832
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,200
Speak up, let's start
the discussion, speak up!

833
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
I have problems, too,
I have things going in my head

834
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,000
Don't do it again, never!

835
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,800
Never again. Next time you have something
to say, just speak up

836
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,400
I can't stand moods like that

837
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,200
What will you write down?

838
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,000
What will you write down? Your mood?

839
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:55,200
What you want to tell me?
Tell it to me, now, in front of me

840
00:46:55,235 --> 00:46:57,600
so you'll see my reactions, live

841
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,400
Now, if it's your way to talk,
write your letter and get lost

842
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,600
Don't talk with me. Damn, women!

843
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,000
You want us to stay like that for years.

844
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,000
Karim

845
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm going

846
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,400
I discovered, in one of your books

847
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:57,600
the charming dedication that the boy

848
00:47:57,635 --> 00:47:59,600
called Farid, wrote to you

849
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,800
I you love him, go with him

850
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,800
I can't live with a man who doesn't love me

851
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,400
who loves somebody else

852
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,200
Of late, you didn't touch me anymore

853
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,000
you didn't want me to touch you

854
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,000
I need love

855
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,600
I can't live without tenderness

856
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,800
If you think you love me, come back

857
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,600
I don't say we won't meet again

858
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,400
I need time to think

859
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,800
Bye for now

860
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,000
Siam

861
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,800
Yes, sure you can come

862
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,400
Siam went back to Algeria

863
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,165
We live like rats, here

864
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,000
It's hard, within this society which
doesn't understand anything

865
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,765
It's really risky, nowadays

866
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,200
to be discovered as a homosexual

867
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:12,600
and arrested by the state

868
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,600
You can be raped, beaten al night long

869
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,600
you can even die, without your family
knowing anything about you

870
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
A whore lived in the neighborhood, once

871
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,800
she got... killed

872
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,200
She got... slayed

873
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:26,600
Hey, Karim

874
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,400
Karim

875
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:34,800
So tell me about your problems

876
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Well, I stop the film-making

877
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,400
I don't know, the subject isn't innocent

878
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,000
perhaps I choose it unconsciously to...

879
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:51,800
I don't know, to expose my desire for men

880
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,400
Don't you have a girlfirend?

881
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,600
It's over

882
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:56,000
You didn't tell me that

883
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,600
No, because it's over,
and it's between she and me

884
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,000
Anyway, I'm unable to live with somebody

885
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:02,800
We'll never marry, so?

886
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,800
Do you want to travel with me, see the sun

887
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,400
show you homosexual practices in Maghreb

888
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,000
I will be your guide.

889
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,600
Day after tomorrow

890
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,400
As you see, there's two of them

891
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,000
for both of us

892
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:35,565
What do you plan to do there?

893
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,600
Assert if you are truly gay, or not.

894
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,400
No, why did you want to bring me there

895
00:50:40,435 --> 00:50:42,000
since you didn't know I took this decision

896
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,200
I wished to be a longer time with you

897
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,000
I, alone

898
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
at least a week

899
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,400
to see if we are made for each other

900
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,400
You only have to say yes

901
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,000
Yes to what? The journey, or you and me?

902
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,200
The journey, first

903
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,200
us, later.

904
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
No, I left Siam, I'm not oing with a man

905
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,365
I don't know where I stand.
- Karim

906
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,600
what you just said is quite contradictory

907
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,800
anyway, you're gay

908
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,800
Look at me, please

909
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,200
Stop that

910
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,200
What are you doing? Stop it.

911
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:20,800
You don't know what you miss.

912
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,800
I don't know, I don't want anymore

913
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,800
Finish your project, first

914
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:27,400
I feel like filming

915
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,400
Be a man, now, OK?

916
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,000
Eh Karim

917
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,000
OK?

918
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:07,800
How do I do?

919
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,200
I'm sorry, we got a double room,
but I've to smoke

920
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,700
- Oh no, no
- I smoke

921
00:52:11,735 --> 00:52:12,765
You go smoking outside

922
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,400
- No, I smoke
- You're not smoking in the room

923
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,800
That's not your home

924
00:52:15,801 --> 00:52:16,400
Go smoking there

925
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,802
No, I smoke

926
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:18,803
Go smoking in the hammam

927
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
I can't smoke where it stinks

928
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,000
It doesn't stink, it smells

929
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,000
No, smoke outside

930
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,000
Where are you smoking?

931
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Fine, I go outside

932
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,200
I'm outside, but...

933
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,800
Do you fuck?

934
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,800
- What?
- Do you fuck?

935
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,200
Do I fuck?

936
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,080
Yes, it happens, sometimes

937
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,600
Would you like a shower?

938
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,200
As they say in the traveller's guide

939
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
what you shouldn't do is

940
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,400
assuming young people walking in the street hand
in hand, or rather finger in hand, are gay

941
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,200
it's a sign of friendship, and not homosexuality.

942
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,200
Wow, top camera

943
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,200
I know

944
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,200
It's ten times better than mine

945
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:38,400
I know too

946
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:42,800
Smile to the camera

947
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:45,600
How are you?

948
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,800
Like that?

949
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Go on, pose

950
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,200
You can also shoot stills with that?

951
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,000
Wow, what a item

952
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,200
Am I the item

953
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,800
Oh yes, excuse me

954
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:08,600
Are you shooting?

955
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,000
Yeah

956
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,800
First day of filming. It's very hot,
we just arrived in Marrakesh

957
00:54:16,835 --> 00:54:19,000
the town, where, it is said,

958
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,800
homosexuality is quite tolerated

959
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:26,000
Marrakesh is the Moroccan Marais

960
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,000
Yep

961
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,800
It's the "Funkish" district

962
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
There's surely a lot of
gay young Maghrebin here

963
00:54:37,235 --> 00:54:38,200
but I don't know where they hide

964
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,600
Seems gay bars exist, like in the Marais

965
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,000
but here, no bar claims to be openly gay

966
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,400
and anyway, no native
will let himself filmed

967
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,800
Well, that's Marrakesh

968
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,200
the great square I show you before

969
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,600
lot of cruising

970
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,000
Tourists?

971
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
yes, tourists.

972
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,000
Prostitution, then?

973
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:12,600
Yeah

974
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,200
I took a few notes

975
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,200
I'll read them to you

976
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,600
Sexuality can't come true

977
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,400
only in the rightful frame of marriage

978
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:24,000
with the almost exclusive
goal of reproduction

979
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,800
Islam rejects any whim during
sex, refuses passing unions

980
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,600
and condemn free union

981
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,600
However, age of marriage comes late

982
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:35,600
so, for lack of performing heterosexual sex

983
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,600
whereas he's in full possession
of his sexual organs

984
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,800
the young finds in homosexuality

985
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,800
a feasible outlet to hetero sex.

986
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,000
So homosexuality is quite
practiced before marriage

987
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,200
and operates like a substitution sexuality

988
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,600
So it's a normal evolution
of young maghrebin sexual life

989
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,200
You know, I've read that, so...

990
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,200
I'm not aware

991
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
now you've seen it

992
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:05,801
but the gesture is...

993
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,400
And all these people, all these boys,
what are they here for?

994
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,600
Amongst these people, almost 80% have
already had a relation with a same sex person

995
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,800
Look, as people pass by, they ogle

996
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,600
- Whether they wear a jellabah or not...
- That's normal

997
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,000
Why is it normal

998
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,200
I've been cruised quite a lot,
since we are here

999
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,800
The guy in the shop, where we were

1000
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,200
he told me you're an algerian, i said yes

1001
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,000
he told me I can see it, because
it's beautiful people, all that

1002
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,000
After that, he asks me which hotel I
stay in, and if he may come tonight

1003
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,000
Did you give him the name of our hotel?

1004
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:57,600
Yes, but he didn't know it, and
I didn't took the trouble to explain

1005
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,200
I told him if I wished to see
him again, I'd come back

1006
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,200
Why did you give him
the name of the hotel

1007
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:08,000
whilst you know he was cruising you,
he told you you were cute

1008
00:57:08,035 --> 00:57:11,200
Because when you are in it,
first you are surprised

1009
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,600
as long as he hasn't done a true approach

1010
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,200
a positive and honest approach

1011
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,765
he said he wanted to come

1012
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,400
- Somebody tells me algerians like you are cute
- Listen, you have the habit, I don't

1013
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,600
I didn't know he...

1014
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:28,000
- if I become jealous... - He says...
he just said which hotel are you in

1015
00:57:28,035 --> 00:57:29,000
then he told me...

1016
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
- Don't forget I speak arab, he wondered if...
- So at that moment, you were being cruised

1017
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:40,200
Some guys made me understand they were
at my service in every sense of the word

1018
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
and I know it doesn't cause any problem
I know they are quite...

1019
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,400
they are quite warmhearted, quite close

1020
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,400
Karim

1021
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,000
After Wermeer

1022
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:39,400
the male "Venus of Milo"

1023
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,200
How's my garb?

1024
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:42,600
What?

1025
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Too long?

1026
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,200
Too long

1027
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
Do you know Siwa

1028
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:12,600
Yep

1029
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,400
There has been men's weddings till the 40s

1030
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,565
and you know, an anthropologist said

1031
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,000
there, at the beginning of the century,
homosexuality was thriving

1032
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,200
every man had sodomy

1033
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,000
they spoke of it openly

1034
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,000
and bosses had harems with boys

1035
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,800
in Siwa oasis

1036
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,200
Egypt was quite open, at that time, no?

1037
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,800
What are you ogling like that?

1038
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,800
Not much to ogle here.

1039
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:53,000
There's me

1040
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:01,200
Karim, you're a startled virgin, who waits
the wedding to be deflowered. Farid

1041
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:16,800
Farid, if you write instead of talking, I can do
as much: don't be so much of a bully with me

1042
01:00:16,835 --> 01:00:20,000
If you want me, learn to be more delicate

1043
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,400
Is it OK?

1044
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,600
Wait, I pushed some button

1045
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:34,400
Give it to me

1046
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:35,600
Why?

1047
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I will do the film

1048
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,800
- What's that?
- I will act as the guide

1049
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Why, are you aware now?

1050
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,000
We won't use many cameras

1051
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,565
That's mine

1052
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,800
Wait, don't be afraid

1053
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,800
Farid, do you want me to be your guide?

1054
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,000
Are you really a student in psychology?

1055
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:53,400
Yeah?

1056
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,400
Oh well. I've never checked.

1057
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:00,000
I didn't check if you were a real steward

1058
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,800
I've never said...

1059
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,400
I've never told you to trust me

1060
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,400
Go on. Be the guide.

1061
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:09,600
I'm your guide?

1062
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,800
Amongst places which allow
closeness of same sex people

1063
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:13,800
there's also the

1064
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,200
the coranic school is where the child has
his first contact with sacred texts

1065
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,400
the sexual dimension takes its place

1066
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:22,165
it's often with his body's favors

1067
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,000
that the boy bypass
his master's aggressivity

1068
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,600
When the master doesn't pay attention

1069
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,600
the oldest schoolboys take charge of
the initiation of the youngest

1070
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:31,600
indulging in sodomy with them

1071
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,800
People overlooked homosexual
practices in these places.

1072
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,200
Some even say the master's sperm

1073
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:41,000
includes a measure of intelligence
and divine blessing

1074
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,200
A Middle Atlas proverb says:

1075
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,800
"He who wants to learn,
should go under the master"

1076
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,400
You should sign up your texts, Farid

1077
01:01:51,435 --> 01:01:52,200
Don't play with that

1078
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,200
How I love you!

1079
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,200
Put you hand away

1080
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,400
Farid is upset, and doesn't want
to be filmed anymore

1081
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,600
Don't look and you won't hear anymore

1082
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,765
The road to love

1083
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:17,565
You don't want to take, o my heart
the road that leads to love

1084
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,400
Everything is ready for you now,
but you don't want to do anything.

1085
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,200
Say yes to me

1086
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Take a responsability
at least once in your life

1087
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,040
Farid, won't you stop your acting?

1088
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,400
Karim

1089
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,600
Say yes or no to me

1090
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,800
Say yes or no to me

1091
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,200
Hey! It's yes or no. Now!

1092
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,400
I've other things to do,
I'm not at your disposal

1093
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,400
Lovers or nothing

1094
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,000
Lovers or nothing, that's it

1095
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,400
I don't want to make the movie anymore

1096
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,800
I don't know where all that story leads

1097
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:53,200
I don't know where all that story leads, and I ask
myself questions without finding any answers

1098
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,200
He told me I want to go
to Jean Genet's grave

1099
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:36,235
before going away

1100
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,960
To say the truth, I didn't expect that

1101
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,400
but I was happy to go there

1102
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,600
"For you this book of persian poems
As for my dedication, Jean Genet will do it in my stead

1103
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,000
When I was a child, God was mostly a picture

1104
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,600
When I was a child, God was mostly a picture

1105
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,800
God didn't count in my kid's little life

1106
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:13,400
At 15, I was seriously ill

1107
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:18,000
every day, in hospital, a nurse
brought me a candy, saying

1108
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,800
That's the sick boy next room
who sends it to you

1109
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,400
I went better, and after a fortnight,
I wished to see

1110
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,800
and thank the boy who sent me
a candy every day

1111
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I saw a 16-17 years old guy,
who was so good looking

1112
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,400
everything that existed before
didn't count anymore

1113
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,600
God didn't exist, he was God

1114
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,800
From that guy, a lot of copies were made,
who became all the lovers I had until a decade

1115
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
but no faded copies, on the contrary copies
sometimes cuter than the original

1116
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,800
So God, it's in Greece I knew Him best

1117
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:51,200
Greece, and arab countries

1118
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,800
Buy a postcard, it's easier

1119
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Romantic pics for a dime, do you
want me running on the shore?

1120
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:47,400
Come along

1121
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:49,600
There is an excerpt on a city in Algeria

1122
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:52,800
where weddings between men took place

1123
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:55,200
as in Siwa

1124
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,200
Listen

1125
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:59,800
Practices we call aberrant

1126
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,200
are normal in other societies

1127
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:05,400
especially homosexuality which often enjoys
unanimous apporbation from the group

1128
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,800
as in the case of Beni Brahim, in Ouargla,
which dispense men's weddings

1129
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,800
before the ordinary marriage.

1130
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:27,200
Karim, you talked again of men's weddings

1131
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:31,000
So, meet me in an hour at Foucauld's square

1132
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,000
Tomorrow mornig, we take the plane back

1133
01:06:43,001 --> 01:06:46,400
If you don't move until
then, it'll be too late.

1134
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,400
What is it?

1135
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,600
Well,

1136
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,800
you'll have to give it to me, now.

1137
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
