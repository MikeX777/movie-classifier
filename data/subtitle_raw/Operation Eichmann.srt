Into enemy territory,
where food supplies

complete harmony

if you don't mind...

The Arithmetic
is quite elementary.

80
00:04:55,396 --> 00:04:58,566
Within our area
of protection in Europe today

81
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,402
There are over
six million Jews.

82
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,071
The food they now consume
will feed our army

83
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,340
And the workers
in our factories.

84
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:08,409
It is our task
to bring that food

To those who require it
in the shortest passage of time.

86

87

At once?

88

But it is impossible.

89
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:20,454
We couldn't even handle so much
beef in slaughter houses.

90
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,122
It's a problem of transportation

Not only here in Germany

92
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,360
But in Romania, in Hungary

'In-in Poland, in Russia.'

line up hundreds at a time.

of the ammunition.

It'll take years..
The war would be over...

Gentlemen, gentlemen, I did not
summon you here to advise me.

100

was put into my hands.

of man power, Colonel.

we are eliminating

a shortage of labor.

ten, twenty times that number.

a year?

[Sobbing]

192
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,861
It was a day..

193
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:15,295
To remember.

194
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,742
Aren't they perfect, Adolf?
Aren't they just perfect?

195
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,879
(Hoss)
Now, don't be so modest.

[All laugh]

00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,048

A beautiful bloom
of the third Reich.

199
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,252
You know, Tessa,
in your charming home

200
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,088
Time passes much too swiftly.

201
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,891
Oh, thank you, Adolf.

202
00:13:43,957 --> 00:13:46,359
- A little more, Colonel?
- Yes, thank you.

203
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,895
Tessa, please.

204
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,662
Ah, Lisa.

205
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:54,734
You know, Colonel.
There is a new program.

206
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,204
One element
which is genius.

207
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,940
- Shear genius.
- Yes, what is that?

208
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,042
It is humane.

209
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:05,545
Yes, the victim anticipates
nothing. On the contrary...

210
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,247
No no no.

211
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,550
I mean, that I'm talking
about the humanity..

212
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,886
To our man, the SS.

213
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,755

'To eliminate not only man,
but women and children.'

215
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,095
Eventually, it might
affect their morale.

216
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:24,831
- Yes.
- But this way, it is unseen.

217
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:28,635
What you do not see,
you do not know.

I admire cleanliness.

221
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,748
- It's perhaps a whim of mine.
- Oh, it's a virtue, Adolf.

222
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,150
Thank you.

Ah, Felsner.
Yes, put him on.

229
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,226
And see if you can get through
to my wife again.

230
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:31,564
Good morning, Felsner.

231
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:36,503
I have studied your report
very carefully.

232
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,172
A most unpleasant surprise,
Felsner

233
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,142
That you're production is down
over 15% for the month.

234
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:47,314
Felsner, you have
a quota to fill.

235
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,749
This is no time to relax.

236
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,253
Perhaps in Berlin there is
relaxation, Herr Colonel.

237
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,555
Here at Dachau,
we have no theaters

238

No actresses
for cultural activities.

'Do you wish me to repeat,
Herr Colonel?'

Here at Dachau
there is no relaxation.

242
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:09,002
The reports indicate
that over 15% did not reach

243
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,338
The destination
that we have assigned them.

244
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,906

They are to select laborers
from the prisoners of war

251
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:30,790
Not from the Jews.

252
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,426

for the last three days.

No, no. You cannot come
to Berlin.

263

We have air raids every day

264
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:15,402
And the bomb shelters are not
adequate, except for officials.

you at my earliest opportunity.

to hear of victory.

string of victories.

her first pearl

aren't you?

For me there are
only two goals.

Victory..

280
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,334
And love.

281
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:27,039
To achieve victory, you bring
food to our soldiers, Ja?

282
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:31,010
To keep love alive
you must nourish it also.

283
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,746
But not with jewels, Anna.
That would be corrupt.

284
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:37,884
Oh, Adolf.
How could it be?

285
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,719
Look at all these women
with their

286
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,389
Beautiful diamonds
and emeralds.

287
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,091

they got them?

Heaven?

289
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,661
That is illegal.

00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,198
How could it be?

291
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53,533
Adolf, the previous owners
of these jewels

292
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,204
Are no longer interested
in legality.

293
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,207
Anna,
let me tell you something.

294
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,176
Today when you take one penny..

295
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:04,744
You take it from
the Fuhrer.

296
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:06,579
You take it the Third Reich.

00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:11,284
Yes, Lieutenant?

without fruits is like

A bag with a big hole
in the bottom.

302
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:27,634
Hmm.

303
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,736
I better forget
what you just said.

304
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:34,707
How can I level acquisitions
at such youth, such beauty.

305
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,676

Herr Reichsführer, it is about
the Ministry of Labor

Arbitrarily taking
prisoners for workers.

311
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,608
I said,
I anticipate you, Adolf.

312
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,944
But, we have
another problem.

313
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:15,147
We've just received some news.

314
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,016
It is so bad that Herr Goebbels

315
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,519
Has not yet figured out
how to release it.

316
00:20:19,586 --> 00:20:22,121
We've just had a word that our
armies before Stalingrad

317
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:23,656
Has been routed.

318
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:25,758
That is impossible!

319
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,959
Decimated.

320
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,529

322
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,903
We've lost over a half a million
men with their equipment.

323
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,207
It could mean,
that we'll lose the war.

324
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:42,642
No!

325
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,377
I said, "it could".

326
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,446
Then, Reichsführer,
we must fight a defensive war

327
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:48,281
From now until victory.

328
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:51,651
We shall put the enemy on his
knees on our own soil.

329
00:20:51,718 --> 00:20:54,621
Or he will bring us
to our knees.

330
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:58,458
Since either is possible,
we must change immediately

331
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:03,330
Our policy for the final
solution of the Jewish problem.

332
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,832
You mean, discontinue?

333
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:07,900
On the contrary.

334
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,470
But it is imperative
that every trace

335
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,171
Of our activities is removed

336
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:15,207
Not one shred of evidence
must be found.

337
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,977
Herr Reichsführer we could ask
the Ministry of Agriculture

338
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:20,547
To plant thousands of trees
above the graves.

[Scoffs]

340
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:25,952
Skeletons can be exhumed,
they can be evidence.

341
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:30,222
But not ashes.

342
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,063
Ovens, crematorium.

343
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,271
All traces removed against
the remote possibility..

344
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,074
Of defeat.

345
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,879
We must still device some method
for concealing the mass graves.

346
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:58,551
All graves will be opened, and
the remains will be cremated.

347
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:01,253
Good. Even brilliant, Eichmann.

348
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,458
Construction must
start immediately.

349
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,960

corpses, Herr Eichmann

'Where will we get a labor force
of such magnitude?'

351
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:17,036
Naturally, the work will be done
by the new arrivals.

352
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,071
Precisely, Herr Reichsführer

353
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,973
Oh.

354

Goebbels, oven 3 has been out
of commission for three days.

365

Yes, yes, but the train on which
replacement parts were shipped

366
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:00,780

Why the machinery breaks down
so frequently?

370
00:23:07,754 --> 00:23:11,758
It's over used. All the camps
have been instructed

371
00:23:11,824 --> 00:23:16,195
Not to run the ovens
more than 16 hours a day.

of ten thousand a day.

working 24 hours a day, not 16.

Now don't tell me again
that it cannot be done.

is this corruption that

has been caught?

escape. These are the facts.

Never, Herr Colonel.

Since Captain Galfas has already
besmirched it by his actions

393

I suggest that you retrieve it
before it is further smeared.

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,785
'It's me Anna.'

539
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,500

540
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,168
They said
you were dead.

541
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:30,241
No, you've gotta
get out of here.

542
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,512
I don't care where you go,
but you can't stay here.

543
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:36,582
I've had enough trouble. They'll
kill me if they find you here.

544
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:38,116
They won't find me.

545
00:38:38,183 --> 00:38:40,452
Nobody can escape them.
I'm taking no any chances.

546
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:43,889
Are you so stupid? Can't you
see that I have escaped?

547
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,691
What you were followed?

548
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,993
No, no. You can't stay here.

549
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:55,033
If I tell you that I have
a fortune hidden away.

550
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,736
Enough to take you out of this
filth and rubble

551

Where you can live
in style and luxury

553
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:06,211
Will you still tell me
go away? Hmm?

554
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,080
You really have money?

555
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:11,282
Jewelry?

556
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,418
Gold?

557
00:39:12,484 --> 00:39:14,285
Enough for a long time.

558
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,154
For both of us.

559
00:39:16,221 --> 00:39:18,089
Well.

560
00:39:18,156 --> 00:39:20,626
Thank God you got smart
before it was too late.

561
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,728
I have stolen nothing.

562
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,231
I've taken what is necessary
for the cause, not for myself.

563
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,599
Any self-respecting man

564
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:29,501
Could do no worse
under the circumstances.

565
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:30,936
I am not ashamed.

566
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:33,905
Ashamed?

567
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,408
Adolf, it's wonderful.

568
00:39:36,475 --> 00:39:39,177
I love you for it.

569
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:41,312
Uh, you must be hungry.

570
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,319
There is no water.
No soap.

571
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,322
It is impossible for a person
to get clean anymore, Adolf.

572
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,258
It's terrible these days.

573
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:56,194
The people we know, our friends,
they're all being caught.

574
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,498
Ah! Far from everyone, Anna. You
have no idea how many've escaped

575
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,700
And they are right back
here in Germany

576
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,035
Working for the cause.
They'll help us.

577
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:05,704
- You think so?
- I know so.

578
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:08,507
Who knows better than I.
Who they are, where they are

579
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,108
And what they've done.

580
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:12,143
They'll be happy
to help me with passports

581
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,680
With important work,
in any country I choose.

582
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,982
I am a power, Anna.

583
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,718
How did you escape?

584
00:40:19,785 --> 00:40:22,387
When you match intelligence
against stupidity

585
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,356
There is no contest.

586
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,527
I am not Adolf Eichmann.

587
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:30,128
My name is Hans Schmidt.

588
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:33,131
Private first class,
15th Infantry Division.

589
00:40:33,198 --> 00:40:35,667
I have his papers,
his identification.

590
00:40:35,734 --> 00:40:38,870
I'm in his uniform,
these rags and tatters.

591
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,739
Along with my
disillusioned comrades.

592

'We surrendered to these
stupid Americans.'

593
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,344
Comrade! Comrade! We wish only
peace, we meant no harm.

594
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:49,515
We are about common soldiers
forced by our superior officers

595
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,150
At gun point to fight.
We mean only peace, peace..

Oh, my SS number, 888653.

598
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,327
It's gone.
I cut it out with a knife.

599
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:06,031
I escaped from the American
prison camp at Leighton's Park.

600
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,734
Now, Han Schmidt, not
Adolf Eichmann is missing.

601
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,570
Adolf Eichmann is dead.
Everyone knows that.

602
00:41:11,637 --> 00:41:13,905
His body was found
in his uniform

603
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,907
With all his identifications.

604
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,677
Yes, that is what
I read in the papers.

605
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:21,613
But why did Han Schmidt exchange
papers and uniform with you?

606
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,448
How could he object?

607
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:26,918
I found him lying dead in a
ditch for at least a week.

608
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:28,453
Hans was a true patriot.

609

This is slop for pigs.

611
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,927
We had better
in the American prison camp.

612
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,063
They will pay
for their cruelty to us.

613
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:41,366
Someday, there will be justice.

614
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,935
There is justice already, Adolf.

615
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,404
If you have money.

616
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,907
Not only justice, but..

617

Fresh bread,
sausage, even wine.

618
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,187
Nothing, but the very best.

Oh, Adolf,
life will be good again.

622
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,802
We will have food,
real food.

623

Real food, Anna.

(David narrating)
The land was rocky and arid.

625

Water was scarce,
the heat intense.

626
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,085
But for the first time in
2000 years, we had a homeland.

627
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:36,021
Israel.

628
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:39,958
From the Holocaust of Europe,
we'd come as decimated people.

629
00:42:40,025 --> 00:42:42,093
Old and young,
sick and wounded.

632
00:42:46,431 --> 00:42:49,601
In a few short years,
we left behind forever

633
00:42:49,668 --> 00:42:53,171
Despair and hopelessness
that had been our heritage.

634
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56,775
A new concept of life
had grown in Israel

635

With it's promise of peace
and freedom and dignity.

The wounds of childhood
would not heal.

639
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,326
For more than ten years,
we had been searching

640
00:43:15,393 --> 00:43:18,864
For Eichmann in every
part of the world.

641
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,966
We were a group
of volunteers

our self to this search.

643
00:43:23,902 --> 00:43:26,371

00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,534
I must leave here at once.

714
00:48:56,601 --> 00:48:58,503
That isn't
possible, Colonel.

715
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:00,138
The Middle East
must become our

716
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:02,507
Center of operations.
That is clear.

717
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:05,510
'Now, how many months do these
idiots require for study?'

718
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:08,513
Colonel, they are
our leaders today.

719
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,681
No! Not so, Kessner.

720
00:49:10,748 --> 00:49:12,717
They are lucky.
They weren't force to flee.

721
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:14,419
There's only one leader, today

722
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,721
Wherever I may be forced
to set up headquarters.

723
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,991
'Now, listen to me.
I want a passport, credentials'

724
00:49:20,058 --> 00:49:22,893
And official business
connections arranged, at once.

725
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,063
Tell them
that is an order.

726
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,066
Adolf.

727
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,068
Must we go
to the Middle East?

728
00:49:30,135 --> 00:49:32,270
Perhaps, you prefer hell.

[Knocking on the door]

730
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,448
- I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

731
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,787
Get it.

732
00:49:53,524 --> 00:49:55,093
Hello, Sara.

Uri.

734
00:49:56,527 --> 00:49:58,596
What are you doing
here at this time?

735
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:01,299
David, something
has come up.

736
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:03,301
Finally. At least,
I think so.

737
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,804
Here. This just
came from Spain.

738

[Intense music]

739
00:50:22,053 --> 00:50:24,589
That's him.

740
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:25,890
I know him.

741
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:28,226
Are you sure?

742
00:50:28,293 --> 00:50:31,996
I can see him at Auschwitz.
Can hear his voice.

743
00:50:34,332 --> 00:50:37,535
I'll never forget
the moment when my mother was..

744
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:40,805
Millions..

745
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:44,542
Millions of mothers, David.

746
00:50:47,312 --> 00:50:49,214
Where is he?

747
00:50:50,548 --> 00:50:53,318
- In Madrid.
- Madrid?

748
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:55,320
A letter that came
with this photo.

749
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,356
A man who calls himself
Lopez, a refugee.

750
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:02,293
He wants to know
if we know who this man is

751
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,029
And he writes if we can
positively identify him

752
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:07,031
As a Nazi war criminal

753
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:10,168
He will be very happy
to have him assassinated.

754
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,203
How soon do you
want me to leave?

755
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,672
As soon as possible.
Jacob is going with you.

756
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:16,441
- Good.
- David.

757
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:20,411
Sara, I've been living
for this moment.

758
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:24,882
Sara.

759
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:28,719
This is a moment
of happiness.

760
00:51:28,786 --> 00:51:31,088
Not one for fear.

761
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:34,024
Goodnight.

[Dramatic music]

763
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,903
I'm not a frightened
wife, David.

764
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,972
I've served with
our army for two years.

765
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,308
- I've learned to conquer fear.
- Sara.

766
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:53,978
I know you, Sara.

767
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,046
I love what I know.

768
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,823
You knew this day
would have to come for me.

769
00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:08,159
Ten years ago, yes.

770
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:10,261
When we still lived
with that nightmare.

771
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:14,565
We have just begun
to live again, David.

772
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:17,568
We are building a new nation.
We are Israelis, now.

773
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,670
Your energy belongs
to the future.

774
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:21,672
Don't give it
to revenge and death.

775
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:23,674
I must go, Sara.

776
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,876
You can't repay murder
with more murder.

777
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:27,912
But we must
have justice.

778
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,247
Justice.

779
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,018
That's for humans, David.

780
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,788
This is beyond anything
any human ever knew.

The man has killed
six million people, David.

782

Men, women, children.

783
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:44,562
What justice is there
for a man like that?

784
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:48,065
What punishment
fit such a crime?

785
00:52:48,132 --> 00:52:50,100
What will you do?
Have six million trials?

786
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,938
Six million executions?
Our ancient laws have changed.

'We don't want
an eye for an eye.'

let's thank God we are alive.

that night in Germany

with their own body.

who covered me.

into his own body

were meant for me.

to give me life.

I saw his face.

The language
he spoke was foreign

he was trying to say

804

so desperately to tell me

Nothing, that I know of.

to urge the greatest caution.

for you in the Middle East.

It's an important island
on the Persian Gulf.

for the day after tomorrow.'

tickets tomorrow afternoon.

for that plane.

- That is excellent.
- Of course.

To get him out of your harbor
on one of your fishing boats.

848

From there we will be able to
transfer him into our boat.

should take exactly one week.

to kill him.

is too great a penalty?'

We need him alive.
We are not assassins.

868
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:55,606
But we can't
let him get away.

869
00:57:55,673 --> 00:57:58,709
If we must have a trial,
we'll give it to him here.

870

Jacob, we are not assassins.

871

and he is guilty.

There is nothing
you can do.

873

Be assured.
We are judges of high quality.

874
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:09,353
Let us go.

875
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,623
We must wait for Juanito.
Then, we will go.

876
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,362
No, David.
I'm glad.

877

His day has come at last.

878
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:23,601
It is straight, amigo.

00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:25,636
Come, let's drink
to ourselves.

880
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:33,611
May we prove to be
as efficient executioners

881
00:58:33,678 --> 00:58:35,713
As we are honorable judges.

882
00:58:38,382 --> 00:58:40,785
What is keeping her?
Two hours.

883
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,721
She should have
been back before now.

884
00:58:43,788 --> 00:58:46,123
It is not two hours, Eichmann.

885
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:48,726
It is not yet
an hour and a half.

886
00:58:48,793 --> 00:58:50,995
Even if they follow me
to the airport tomorrow.

887
00:58:51,061 --> 00:58:53,130
They'll think that
I'm picking up my tickets.

888
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:55,900
I'll be on that plane
before they know it.

889
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:57,902
They'll never know
where I got off.

890
00:58:57,968 --> 00:58:59,904
Oh, never, never,
you'll be absolutely safe.

891
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:01,906
I'm not interested
in safety.

892
00:59:01,972 --> 00:59:05,242
It's important that I live only
to do the work for our party.

893
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,477
Oh, that is exactly
what I meant, Eichmann.

894
00:59:09,513 --> 00:59:12,349
Now, if that foolish
woman would only hurry.

895
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:16,320
- You are stupid, Juanito.
- Why?

896
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,957
- We do not want the woman.
- But we had to have her.

897
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:22,459
We needed these keys
to get into his house.

898
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:25,529
I could not take them
from her and then let her go.

899
00:59:25,596 --> 00:59:28,165
And now, can you let her go?

900
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:34,104
Will you be her judge
and executioner, too?

901
00:59:40,044 --> 00:59:41,779
Let us go.

902
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:44,281
He would begin to suspect
when she doesn't come home.

903
00:59:49,086 --> 00:59:50,788
Jacob?

904
00:59:50,855 --> 00:59:53,991
David, there
is no other way.

905
00:59:54,058 --> 00:59:56,627
It has taken us more
than ten years.

906
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:59,129
- To fail.
- Fail?

907
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:03,901
Jacob, if we kill him,
we failed.

908
01:00:03,968 --> 01:00:07,705
You will.
Not I.

[Phone ringing]

911
01:00:23,253 --> 01:00:25,189
Yes.
Anna?

912
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:27,658
Adolf, they have
my keys to the house.

913
01:00:27,725 --> 01:00:29,660
Get the police.
Protect yourself.

914
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,896
They would be
there any minute.

915
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:39,436
Why did you do this?

916
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:41,605
Never mind that.

917
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:44,141
Get out of here, quickly,
before they come back.

918
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,913
Quickly!

919
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,915
[Dramatic music]

920
01:01:01,025 --> 01:01:04,795
All those years
of searching.

921
01:01:04,862 --> 01:01:09,199
Months of planning, raising
money from friends, all gone.

922
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:12,536
Because of him,
a betrayer.

923
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:15,906
We were under orders
not to kill.

924
01:01:15,973 --> 01:01:19,309
We were not under orders
to help him escape.

925
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:22,046
'We were not under orders
to be informants.'

926
01:01:22,112 --> 01:01:24,281
To notify him,
so he'd call the police.

927
01:01:24,348 --> 01:01:26,550
Jacob, we're
not murderers.

928
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:29,887
Sara, David did not
have to kill him.

929
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:34,058
There were others of us who did
not share his delicate feelings.

930
01:01:34,124 --> 01:01:37,394
He had no moral right to prevent
others from doing what is right.

931
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:41,265
Alright. Suppose,
we had killed him.

932
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:45,102
The newspaper here would have
carried an item this big.

933
01:01:45,169 --> 01:01:48,405
This big. Announcing the
mysterious murder

934
01:01:48,472 --> 01:01:50,407
Of an unknown foreigner.

935
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,843
Not Adolf Eichmann.

936
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:56,246
An unknown foreigner
named Krauss. Krauss.

937
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:58,348
What would
we've accomplished?

938
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:02,787
We could let the world know
he was really Eichmann.

939
01:02:02,853 --> 01:02:06,290
And would they have
necessarily believed us?

940
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:10,761
I say, that if we kill this man
without due process of law

941
01:02:10,828 --> 01:02:13,297
The world will brand
us as murderers.

942
01:02:13,363 --> 01:02:17,701
We will bring him to trial.
Never worry.

943
01:02:17,768 --> 01:02:22,306
We'll never get him.
We've chased him to Kuwait.

944
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:25,275
He plans to make
the Middle East

945
01:02:25,342 --> 01:02:28,145
The center of
a new empire of murder.

946
01:02:28,212 --> 01:02:30,915
With Israel,
the first victim.

947
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:36,153
By letting him live,
you are his accomplice

948
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:38,455
In future murders.
You.

949
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:44,862
- We'll run him out.
- You'll run him out?

950
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:47,431
Out of a country
you can't even get into?

951

[Instrumental music]

952
01:02:54,404 --> 01:02:56,373
In the two years
that followed

953
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,043
Contributions came
from all over the world.

954
01:02:59,109 --> 01:03:03,213
Only vast sums of money could
move Eichmann out of Kuwait.

955
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,782
Now, we had it.
We were ready.

956
01:03:07,384 --> 01:03:08,785
[Instrumental music]

957
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:14,091
It was decided that
Jacob and I would go.

958
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:16,426
Our differences
were long forgotten.

959
01:03:18,495 --> 01:03:20,730
Patient and painstaking work
had gone into our preparations

960
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,766
For this moment.
And we believed we'd found

961
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:26,036
An answer
in Eichmann's early history.

962
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:28,839
We were going to bring it
back. Now. To haunt him.

963
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:34,278
Our passports were good.
But we didn't have much time.

964
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:37,281
The ship would only be
in port 48 hours.

965
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,133
No, no, there is no need
to be apprehensive.

966
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,904
Your shipment of cars has left
Germany over a month ago.

967
01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:02,706
Yes, I can assure you.
My gratitude will be expressed

968
01:04:02,772 --> 01:04:05,109
In a most
substantial fashion.

969
01:04:05,175 --> 01:04:06,510
Thank you.

970
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:11,048
Hakim Benahmed
is here to see you.

971
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:14,051
- The police?
- He said it was urgent.

972
01:04:14,118 --> 01:04:15,752
- Urgent?
- Hmm.

973
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:17,854
Show him in.
Show him in.

974
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,731
Ah, my dear Hakim Benahmed.
What an unexpected pleasure.

975
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,733
Won't you join me
in some coffee?

976
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,568
- No, thank you.
- Sit down, won't you?

977
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,570
No, thank you.

978
01:04:33,637 --> 01:04:36,640
Well, now, let's see. You were
here last, about a month ago.

979
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,176
I didn't expect to see you
again for another week.

980
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:43,280
Herr Brunner, I'm here
to protect your life.

981
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:45,249
If necessary,
with my own.

982
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,118
My life?

983
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:50,354
You're in great jeopardy,
Herr Brunner.

984
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,361
I don't understand.

985
01:04:57,427 --> 01:05:00,264
An official in my department
has received evidence

986
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,033
That you are
an agent of Israel.

987
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,834
'A Jew.'

988
01:05:08,272 --> 01:05:12,176
I? That's preposterous.
Such information could...

989
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,778
It's not information,
but evidence.

990
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,981
Nonsense.
That's outrageous.

991
01:05:17,047 --> 01:05:20,150
Your dossier indicates
you speak Yiddish and Hebrew.

992
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:23,687
You lived in that, uh,
obscene country.

993
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,956
Yes, yes, yes.
But that was years ago.

994
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:27,992
It was then, Palestine.

995
01:05:28,058 --> 01:05:30,794
I was a German agent for the
National Socialist Government.

996
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,729
I know that..

997
01:05:34,198 --> 01:05:36,066
Herr Eichmann.

998
01:05:41,438 --> 01:05:43,873
That is why I wish,
to save your life.

999
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:47,744
The report
branded you as a Jew.

1000
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:51,048
It's already known
by many people.

1001
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:55,652
Too many.

1002
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:57,287
As a Jew..

1003
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:01,658

assassinated in 24 hours.'

the largest German industries.

1005
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:07,864
They will defend
their representatives, here.

1006
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:09,933
- Get in touch with them!
- I have.

1007
01:06:11,568 --> 01:06:14,604
I've cabled to ask
if they knew you were a Jew.

1008
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:20,077
They have not replied.

1009
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:24,281
I'll have a passport and get you
away safely in 24 hours.

1010
01:06:29,019 --> 01:06:31,255
You are thinking, perhaps,
if you revealed yourself

1011
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,956
To be Eichmann..

1012
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:37,094
'...you would not
remain alive very long.'

1013
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,465
There would be
a high price on your head.

1014
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:45,069
My people,
well... to my regret

1015
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:47,571
We have many
impoverished people..

1016
01:06:47,637 --> 01:06:52,109
To whom money
is greater value than life.

1017
01:06:52,176 --> 01:06:55,612
That is when
the lives are not their own.

1018
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,083
But be at peace, Eichmann.

1019
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:01,885
I will protect you
as if your life were my own.

1020
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:05,355
Until, you're
on the plane.

1021
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:10,794
[Dramatic music]

1022
01:07:21,371 --> 01:07:23,973
At last, we had given him
the taste of terror.

1023
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,676
That cold sweat
of his own fear.

1024
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:30,013
Eichmann was on his way
to South America.

1025
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,548
Buenos Aires.

1026
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,853
From now on there wouldn't be a
moment for him without fear.

1027
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,922
Our plan was to keep him
within reach

1028
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,924
Until, we were ready
to take him.

1029
01:08:10,454 --> 01:08:12,389
You received my cable.

1030
01:08:12,456 --> 01:08:16,226
That's good.
What has happened to you?

1031
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:22,499
What has not happened?

1032
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:25,835
I did not think I would
ever be glad to see you again.

1033
01:08:25,902 --> 01:08:28,805
But I am.

1034
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:30,774
Come, Anna.

1035
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:47,123
You live here?

1036
01:08:48,258 --> 01:08:50,227
You do not
have to stay.

1037
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:52,229
That's not
what I meant.

1038
01:08:52,296 --> 01:08:55,199
In your letters, you never
said anything about why you came

1039
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:57,201
To South America
in the first place.

1040
01:08:57,267 --> 01:08:59,403
They would not let me
back into Germany.

1041
01:09:01,405 --> 01:09:05,175
But I have a job,
I get by.

1042
01:09:05,242 --> 01:09:10,280
Once I am settled, we'll move
into a more befitting place.

1043
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:12,516
But first, I must telephone
Senor Santez.

1044
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,951
He's in charge here
of everything.

1045
01:09:15,018 --> 01:09:19,022
You don't have to, Adolf.
He's on his way here to see you.

1046
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,059
How could that be?

1047
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:27,231
As you said, "He's in charge
of everything here."

1048
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:30,467
I told him
you were coming.

1049
01:09:30,534 --> 01:09:32,269
You know him?

[Knocking on the door]

1051
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:37,974
You know him also.

[Knocking on the door]

1053
01:09:40,477 --> 01:09:43,347
Adolf, be careful.

1054
01:09:44,648 --> 01:09:47,217
They're angry with you.

[Eichman laughing]

1056
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:56,726
Kessner.

1057
01:09:58,662 --> 01:10:00,630
When Anna told me
that you were coming

1058
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,867
I cabled immediately
to Europe for instructions.

1059
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:08,472
You've made a mess
of things, Adolf.

1060
01:10:08,538 --> 01:10:10,173
You better explain.

1061
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:12,576
You let the Jews,
run you out of Kuwait.

1062
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,311
(Eichmann)
'That is not true.'

1063
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:17,247
There was an attempt
on my life and I was caught.

1064
01:10:17,314 --> 01:10:19,583
You were caught...
by fear!

1065
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:21,585
No. There's been
a tragic mix up

1066
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:23,520
And I shall write
an explanation.

1067
01:10:23,587 --> 01:10:25,121
By all means.

1068
01:10:25,188 --> 01:10:27,257
Give me your communication
and I shall forward...

1069
01:10:27,324 --> 01:10:29,393
No, no, no.

1070
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:36,633
Your fear has forced
headquarters to change

1071
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:42,238
Their address. So... now
we understand each other.

1072
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,643
They have instructed me
to get a job for you.

1073
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,880
Inconspicuous, modest.
Out of public sight.

1074
01:10:50,947 --> 01:10:54,784
'You're to refrain from all
organizational activities.'

1075
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:57,621
As long as you obey orders,
you will be safe.

1076
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:07,297
You will hear from me
about the job through Anna.

1077
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:19,809
Little Kessner here
in Argentina giving me orders!

1078
01:11:19,876 --> 01:11:23,380
I must find out
the new address of headquarters.

1079
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:26,182
Why, Adolf?

1080
01:11:26,249 --> 01:11:27,784
Why?

1081
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:34,824
Can't you forget the past
and all the glory?

1082
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:38,261
You could stop running.
We could live.

1083
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:40,830
They would give you a job.
Nobody would know you.

1084
01:11:40,897 --> 01:11:43,099
No!

1085
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:46,936
I will never tolerate that.
I am the leader of the movement.

1086
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:49,573
The movement?

1087
01:11:49,639 --> 01:11:52,709
Adolf, the movement
is in other hands.

1088
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:55,845
- Your day is over.
- Never.

1089
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:59,816
They will learn that Eichmann
cannot be disposed off easily.

1090
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:03,920
I don't
want you caught.

1091
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:07,591
You're afraid
to have me here?

1092
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,960
[Dramatic music]

1093
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:19,803
Adolf, for so long
I have been afraid.

1094
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,039
I'm tired now.

1095
01:12:25,308 --> 01:12:27,811
I want to know
which is worse.

1096
01:12:28,978 --> 01:12:32,281
Fear or loneliness.

1097
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:53,336
What's the job?

1098
01:12:53,403 --> 01:12:57,674
The last few months have been
busy with personal matters.

1099
01:12:57,741 --> 01:12:59,909
The menial job does not
bother me anymore.

1100
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:02,579
There was an interesting item
in the newspaper.

1101
01:13:02,646 --> 01:13:05,415
- So?
- This anniversary here.

1102
01:13:05,482 --> 01:13:08,752
This would be an International
Industrial Agricultural fair.

1103
01:13:08,818 --> 01:13:11,655
Delegation from Israel
is coming.

1104
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:14,691
And Kessner is worried
that there may be agents

1105
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:16,025
Among the delegation, hmm?

1106
01:13:16,092 --> 01:13:18,828
Kessner is worried
about many things.

1107
01:13:18,895 --> 01:13:21,565
He also would like to see you.
Come on over.

1108
01:13:24,668 --> 01:13:29,473
You're letting vanity and false
pride lead you into trouble.

1109
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:34,143
I am grateful for the concern
you show about my welfare.

1110
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:38,347
Serious charges
have been made against you.

1111
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:42,051
In the factory,
at social gatherings

1112
01:13:42,118 --> 01:13:45,689
You're talking
carelessly, dangerously.

1113
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:48,658
You give me
the address of headquarters.

1114
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:51,495
I want to communicate
with them directly.

1115
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:54,731
Despite my instructions
and then my warnings

1116
01:13:54,798 --> 01:13:59,569
You have written to Von Mayers
in Egypt, to Kretel and Mario.

1117
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:01,905
'Your letters have been
turned over to headquarters.'

1118
01:14:01,971 --> 01:14:04,674
'Many people are demanding
that the strictest measures'

1119
01:14:04,741 --> 01:14:06,676
'Be taken against you.'

1120
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:10,413
I will stop when you give me
the new address of headquarters.

1121
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,683
You're endangering
the entire organization.

1122
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:17,420
Not I.
It is you.

1123
01:14:17,487 --> 01:14:19,623
You cannot take away
my proper position.

1124
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:25,529
You've heard of this delegation
of Jews arriving here?

1125
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:28,097
There would be
agents amongst them.

1126
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:30,433
They will get you, Eichmann.

1127
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:33,603
Hitler and Himmler
entrusted me

1128
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,272
Only me, with the final solution
of the Jewish problem.

1129
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:38,908
Ah, only you.

1130
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,711
After Himmler
and Bormann, I came next.

1131
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:46,282
I am now the new leader above
everyone else at headquarters.

1132
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:50,419
You, sitting there in my seat,
behind my desk.

1133
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,958
You cannot gag me
with threats of strict measures.

1134
01:14:55,024 --> 01:14:58,127
(Eichman over recorder)
'Wherever I am, there
are the brains, the power.'

1135
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:00,229
'Only I can rebuild
the organization.'

1136
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:02,899
'Our National
Socialist power.'

1137
01:15:02,966 --> 01:15:06,636
'Now, you tell them, if I go
down, it will not be alone.'

1138
01:15:06,703 --> 01:15:09,806
"'All of you here and those
in Egypt, in the United States"

1139
01:15:09,873 --> 01:15:11,908
'And those
who had it easy so long'

1140
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:13,910
'Secure and well protected.'

1141
01:15:13,977 --> 01:15:17,213
'If I go, I will take
them all down with me.'

1142
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:22,886
Gentlemen, I think,
it's clear what must be done.

1143
01:15:31,828 --> 01:15:33,062
Anna.

1144
01:15:34,798 --> 01:15:37,567
Anna, they're here.

1145
01:15:37,634 --> 01:15:39,636
The Israel delegation, by plane.
They're after me.

1146
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:41,638
Adolf, they're
not after you.

1147
01:15:41,705 --> 01:15:43,640
Now, will try
to get some rest?

1148
01:15:43,707 --> 01:15:46,943
We're safe. We're safe.
Kessner will deliver my message.

1149
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,312
I still have power. Power.

1150
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,014
What message?

1151
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,349
What are you talking about?
Blackmail?

1152
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,652
That's the only language
they understand.

1153
01:15:55,719 --> 01:15:58,855
They're degenerate.
They're corrupt.

1154
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,625
But I'll fix them.
They'll never find me.

1155
01:16:01,691 --> 01:16:04,761
They'll never find..

1156
01:16:04,828 --> 01:16:07,496
'I'm not afraid of them.
I'll fix them.'

1157
01:16:10,199 --> 01:16:12,101
[Dramatic music]

1158
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:11,094
[Door opening]

1159
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,241
[Music continues]

1160
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:51,968
[Softly]
Adolf.

1161
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:37,013
Adolf!

1162
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:45,354
The Star of David.
What did you expect?

1163
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,326
We'll dump him
on the steps of the synagogue.

1164
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:58,101
Klaus!

1165
01:19:04,774 --> 01:19:08,644
Little Kessner is trying
to make the world believe

1166
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:11,080
That the Jews
killed me, hmm.

1167
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:15,618
[Doorbell ringing]

1168
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:23,893
Klaus?

1169
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,301
[Intense music]

1170
01:19:45,414 --> 01:19:47,250
The routine never varies.

1171
01:19:47,316 --> 01:19:51,020
He takes the bus here
every morning to the factory.

1172
01:19:51,087 --> 01:19:56,525
Here, and every night after
work, he returns back here.

1173
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:58,527
What does he do
with his nights?

1174
01:19:58,594 --> 01:20:00,596
He stays in the house.
Never goes out.

1175
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:03,599
From the empty bottles
we find in his trash can

1176
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:06,169
He probably,
drinks himself to sleep.

1177
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:08,204
We'll have no trouble
picking him up.

1178
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:09,338
Good.

1179
01:20:09,405 --> 01:20:11,307
[Phone ringing]

1180
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:19,082
Yes?
Speaking.

1181
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:22,986
I see.

1182
01:20:24,087 --> 01:20:26,022
Alright, stick with him.

1183
01:20:26,089 --> 01:20:29,025
We'll get word to you.

1184
01:20:29,092 --> 01:20:31,460
Well, he didn't go
to the factory today.

1185
01:20:31,527 --> 01:20:34,030
They've traced him to
the house of a German here

1186
01:20:34,097 --> 01:20:36,866
Who goes by
the name of Santos.

1187
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:39,535
Oh, what are we
waiting for?

1188
01:20:43,272 --> 01:20:45,208
I've sent your
message to Europe.

1189
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:47,676
They apologized for their
underestimation of you.

1190
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:50,413
And I too,
of course.

1191
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:54,150
After all, little Kessner
is only a messenger boy.

1192
01:20:54,217 --> 01:20:57,053
I think, you'll be pleased
with their decision.

1193
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:59,055
They've decided
to appoint you

1194
01:20:59,122 --> 01:21:01,824
General Co-coordinator
of all North American affairs.

1195
01:21:01,891 --> 01:21:04,827
Your headquarters
will be in Mexico City.

1196
01:21:04,894 --> 01:21:06,930
Here's your ticket
and your new passport.

1197
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:09,999
You'll leave at once.

1198
01:21:10,066 --> 01:21:12,768
- I will need some money.
- Everything has been arranged.

1199
01:21:12,835 --> 01:21:15,905
You will be met at
the plane by Señor Valdez.

1200
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:17,907
Is that all?

1201
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:20,709
- Good luck.
- Oh, Kessner.

1202
01:21:22,345 --> 01:21:25,181
It's too bad
about Klaus.

1203
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:27,183
'I'm sure that
you'll miss him.'

1204
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,919
Don't underestimate
the enemy.

1205
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:32,421
You're right.

1206
01:21:32,488 --> 01:21:35,458
In order to avoid
underestimating the enemy

1207
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:37,860
One must know him.

1208
01:21:37,927 --> 01:21:39,862
It shall
never happen again.

1209
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:42,898
That's comforting.

1210
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,435
After you're settled,
arrangements will be made

1211
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:48,204
For Anna to join you.

1212
01:21:48,271 --> 01:21:50,206
Oh, such kindness.

1213
01:21:50,273 --> 01:21:52,775
I'm sure
you will enjoy Mexico City.

1214
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,944
Good luck.

1215
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:02,118
Hans.

1216
01:22:08,391 --> 01:22:10,893
Follow him.

1217
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:13,963
His ticket is for Flight-321

1218
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:16,865
Leaving for Mexico City,
tonight at 7:10.

1219
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:19,468
He's no fool.
He may suspect.

1220
01:22:19,535 --> 01:22:21,504
If he does not
get on that plane

1221
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:24,340
We will be forced
to eliminate him here.

1222
01:22:24,407 --> 01:22:27,643
Anyway, do not let him
out of your sight.

1223
01:22:30,213 --> 01:22:34,183
They think, I am an imbecile
who can be fooled like a child.

1224
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,219
But why to Mexico City?

1225
01:22:36,285 --> 01:22:39,488
Not Mexico City, Anna.
Hell.

1226
01:22:39,555 --> 01:22:42,558
Their method, tricking a victim
to his unsuspecting doom.

1227
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,160
[Laughing]

1228
01:22:44,227 --> 01:22:47,730
They forget, it is I,
who invented such methods.

1229
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,898
So, what is their plan?

1230
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:54,870
I'm to be met by one,
Señor Valdez at the airport.

1231
01:22:54,937 --> 01:22:58,441
He's to drive me away.
Drive me where?

1232
01:22:58,507 --> 01:23:04,013
Mexico is one of our graveyards.
A graveyard without a headstone.

1233
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,215
And then, where will you go?

1234
01:23:06,282 --> 01:23:08,784
To Europe.
I have no other choice.

1235
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:11,887
I must tell them what Kessner
is trying to do to me.

1236
01:23:11,954 --> 01:23:15,124
- To all the others.
- But, Adolf.

1237
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,195
You'll hear from me

1238
01:23:19,262 --> 01:23:21,997
When I'm back in power,
where I belong.

1239

[Speaking Spanish]

1242
01:24:19,355 --> 01:24:21,257
Pleasant journey.

1243
01:24:23,259 --> 01:24:24,627
Cancel this flight, please.

1244
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,662
Instead, I must go
to Europe. Immediately.

1245
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,431
Spain or Portugal.

1246
01:24:28,497 --> 01:24:30,999
Do you have anything leaving
before 7 o'clock this evening?

1247
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,036
- I'll see what I can do, sir.
- Thank you.

1248
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:39,542
Can I have a reservation
for this afternoon to Madrid?

1249
01:24:43,045 --> 01:24:46,449
Yeah.
Yes, thank you.

1250
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:48,451
Yes, I have space for one.

1251
01:24:48,517 --> 01:24:51,019
Flight 6,
5:30 this afternoon, to Madrid.

1252
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,588
I'll take it.

1253
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:59,662
Uh, sir, your flight
to Mexico City is tourist class.

1254
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:02,465
'The one to Madrid
is first class.'

1255
01:25:02,531 --> 01:25:05,401
Oh, that's alright.
How much is the difference?

1256
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:08,404
Uh, 23,406 Pesos.

1257
01:25:09,372 --> 01:25:11,874
Twenty three thousand..

1258
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:15,311
Oh, oh, I'm afraid, I..

1259
01:25:15,378 --> 01:25:17,746
Here take this
and reserve the seat.

1260
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:20,349
I will be back
with the balance in an hour.

1261
01:25:20,416 --> 01:25:24,052
Uh, yes, sir.
May I have your name, please?

1262
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,522
My, my name..

1263
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:29,725
Uh, it must be on
the ticket to Mexico, here.

1264
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:31,760
Here's my name.

1265
01:25:36,265 --> 01:25:39,968
Oh, yes, of course.
Señor Wittnauer. I'm sorry.

1266
01:25:41,437 --> 01:25:43,339
I will be back
in one hour.

1267
01:25:48,076 --> 01:25:53,749

[Phone ringing]

1270
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:19,808
- Who is it?
- Anna, I need 15,000 Pesos.

1271
01:26:19,875 --> 01:26:22,211
Bring them to me
at the airport, right away.

1272
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:26,181
You didn't kiss me goodbye.

1273
01:26:28,050 --> 01:26:32,187
Come back
and I give you everything.

1274
01:26:33,622 --> 01:26:37,760
Anna?
Alright, Anna, I'll come.

1275
01:26:37,826 --> 01:26:39,895
I'll get there,
right away.

- Who's that?
- I don't know.

[Music continues]

1281
01:29:20,022 --> 01:29:21,957
You're making a mistake.

1282
01:29:22,024 --> 01:29:24,427
You must take orders from me,
not Kessner.

1283
01:29:24,493 --> 01:29:27,596
Look, if you kill me,
you're betraying your own cause.

1284
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:30,566
You're not Kessner's.
You're my men!

1285
01:29:30,633 --> 01:29:33,469
Once we were
almost yours.

1286
01:29:37,205 --> 01:29:38,907
Almost!

1287
01:29:41,744 --> 01:29:44,780
My name is Adolf Eichmann.
I regret nothing.

1288
01:29:44,847 --> 01:29:47,149
I do not repent.
Kill me!

1289
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:51,086
No. That's too easy,
too quick.

1290
01:29:51,153 --> 01:29:53,789
You're gonna
stand trial, Eichmann.

1291
01:29:53,856 --> 01:29:56,625
People are gonna see you.
They're gonna study you.

1292
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:58,160
They're gonna learn,
how one man

1293
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:01,296
Can become responsible
for the torture and murder

1294
01:30:01,363 --> 01:30:04,266
Of six million
human beings.

1295
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:06,435
Six million!

1296
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:12,775
The world will learn,
and they'll remember.
