1
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:39,096
Hero

2
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:46,477
"A person who has accomplished
an extraordinary deed..."

3
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:53,508
"...and exhibits qualities like honor
and valor."

4
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,086
"Tupac Amaru:"

5
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:07,559
"Fought the Spaniards who were treating
the Indians like slaves in the mines..."

6
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,528
"...and they were dying of asthma."

7
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:14,906
"Then they caught him and tortured him."

8
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:19,670
"They tied his arms and legs
to four horses."

9
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:24,376
"They scared the horses so they
would pull his arms and legs."

10
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:26,918
Like a Barbie doll.

11
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:32,820
"But Tupac Amaru was so strong
that he wouldn't come apart."

12
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:37,429
"And so they had to come with
a machete and chop his head off."

13
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:40,326
Did it hurt when you died?

14
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:43,127
My chest always hurts during gym class.

15
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,565
"Jose Olaya:"

16
00:01:46,906 --> 00:01:51,639
"He was a poor fisherman,
but he was a very good swimmer."

17
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:55,544
"He had to swim through the night
to deliver all the secret letters..."

18
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,650
"...but he was betrayed."

19
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:03,117
"And right before he was caught,
he ate the letters and refused to talk."

20
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,948
"They pulled out his fingernails,
one by one..."

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:11,621
"They cut his throat, then he was
shot by a firing squad."

22
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,033
I'm going to be a hero... like you.

23
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,404
"Miguel Grau:"

24
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,470
"He won a couple of battles
against Chile..."

25
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:27,069
"...but his boat was so tiny that it
was surrounded and bombed..."

26
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,638
"...at the Battle of Angamos."

27
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:36,287
"The only thing that remains is his
boot, which can be seen at the museum."

28
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:40,955
"We celebrate the Battle of Angamos
on October 8th..."

29
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,727
That means that we don't have
to go to school.

30
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:53,097
Why is it a holiday
if we always lose the battles?

31
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,067
I don't know...

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,171
...but we won the War of Independence.

33
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,977
Have you realized that in most of the
parks and plazas of our city...

34
00:03:00,413 --> 00:03:03,143
...there are statues of military heroes
on horseback?

35
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,444
Yes...

36
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:10,113
And did you know that when the horse'
two front legs are in the air...

37
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:14,023
...it means that the soldier
died in the battlefield?

38
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:20,588
Guess what it means if the horse'
two front legs are on the ground.

39
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,359
He didn't die in the battle.

40
00:03:22,468 --> 00:03:23,127
Correct.

41
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,000
But if he didn't die in the battle,
he can't be a hero.

42
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:28,267
You're wrong, Cayetana.

43
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:34,936
And what happens if the horse has one
leg on the ground and one in the air

44
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:40,951
It means that the hero was wounded
in the battle... but survived.

45
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,782
And what happened to the horses?

46
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,558
Girls... bomb threat.
Time to evacuate.

47
00:03:49,095 --> 00:03:52,587
Not again... Quickly, girls.

48
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:06,438
Hey, that' my lunchbox.
What am I going to eat now?

49
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,310
I have a banana if you want.

50
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,351
Doesn't she know another song?

51
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,667
Sit down, de los Heros.

52
00:04:32,338 --> 00:04:37,139
Listen, girls. I think that I'm going
to be really good at sports...

53
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,604
...because I heard Lupe tell Alicia
that I had athlete' foot...

54
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,740
...so one day, I'll be a champion.

55
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:47,285
What about your asthma?

56
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:50,522
And when you get married, who will
take you to the altar...

57
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,420
...your father or step-father?

58
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,719
I'll go alone.

59
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,587
Did you hear about Martita' dad?

60
00:04:55,995 --> 00:04:59,658
Last week they went abroad,
because her dad was a narc.

61
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,131
Abroad?

62
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,235
- What' a narc?
- I don't know.

63
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:05,827
Are you on the right or the left?

64
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,972
Your mom is coming back tomorrow, right?

65
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,951
Her hair must be so long!

66
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:25,682
Did you know that if you stare at
someone for 5 minutes without blinking...

67
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,384
...they go crazy?

68
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:32,791
I've missed her so much.
I haven't seen her in so long.

69
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,793
Cayetana de los Heros...

70
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,764
Bye, Jimena. I have to go.

71
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:42,135
Bye.

72
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,778
Excuse me... Here I am, Ms. Cayetana.

73
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:59,516
If you keep carrying that bag,
you'll become a hunchback.

74
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,434
You crashed.

75
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:15,598
Yes, Ms. Cayetana. I crashed.

76
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,023
Any change, Miss?

77
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,420
No

78
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:43,329
lt' for food... nothing to eat.

79
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:47,428
No, I don't have anything.
I threw everything in the toilet.

80
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,768
But I have these pills...

81
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,310
They're for asthma but when I take
them my hunger goes away.

82
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,907
Please, Ms. Cayetana.
Roll up the window and lock the door.

83
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,817
This neighborhood is dangerous.

84
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,322
My country makes me sad.

85
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,602
The only thing people care about...

86
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,599
...is soccer.

87
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,937
What difference does it make,
if we never win?

88
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:31,082
Final score: Peru 6, Brazil 0.

89
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,878
It must be a mistake.

90
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,894
Why aren't you eating anything,
Cayetana?

91
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,994
Ok. Get some rest.

92
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:45,722
"I would die 1000 deaths before
betraying my comrades or my country."

93
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,906
Your mother won't even recognize you.

94
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:10,807
Have you taken your pills?

95
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:14,612
No, I forgot. Can I have some
lemonade so I can take them?

96
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:17,415
No lemonade. Just drink some water.

97
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,320
Besides, there' no lemons.

98
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:24,788
Let' go outside, they'll
be here any minute.

99
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:27,022
Perfect.

100
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,731
No lemons, huh?

101
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,649
Are you sick?

102
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,325
What' that thing on your beak?

103
00:09:57,663 --> 00:10:00,393
Don't worry, I'll save you.

104
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,071
I'll make you better.

105
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,984
Cayetana, they've arrived!

106
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,018
You're not getting out?

107
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,852
She won't want to see me.

108
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,929
Don't worry, Ines.

109
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,464
I told you to take your pills.

110
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,463
Damn pills...

111
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:43,639
Mrs. Ines, how good to see you.
You look so pretty.

112
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,711
How are things, Lupe?
Good.

113
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,541
Can I have a glass of water?
Yes, of course.

114
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,951
Welcome back, ma'am.

115
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:58,955
Go and say hi to your mom.

116
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,559
Cayetana?

117
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,333
And how was your trip, ma'am?

118
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:15,337
Good.

119
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:19,335
You must be tired after
such a long trip.

120
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:22,711
Classes ended yesterday and I went
straight to the airport.

121
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,840
I barely slept on the airplane.

122
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,316
Where is Cayetana?

123
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:49,803
Sometimes I had nightmares,
thinking that I had forgotten your face.

124
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:52,476
Don't be silly, it hasn't been that long.

125
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,478
What happens when you have to go back?

126
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,604
I don't want to think about that.

127
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:59,811
Maybe we can put Cayetana in a suitcase.

128
00:12:01,654 --> 00:12:07,388
If I am reflected in her eyes,
she only has eyes for me.

129
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,391
Cayetana...

130
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,060
...here' a present for you.

131
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,407
This is also for you.

132
00:12:24,443 --> 00:12:26,638
You don't have this one do you?

133
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,904
Yes, I already have it.

134
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,747
Well... you can pretend
they're twin sisters.

135
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,660
Ohh... how pretty!

136
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,990
For my dolls?

137
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,992
No, it' even better than that.

138
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,434
You're going to have a baby brother.

139
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,062
Congratulations, ma'am.

140
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:55,470
When are you due?

141
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,940
May 2nd.

142
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:00,335
A little brother, Cayetana.

143
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,610
You're so lucky!

144
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:05,044
Why such a sad face?

145
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,911
Aren't you happy about the news?

146
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:13,419
Cayetana...

147
00:13:41,954 --> 00:13:45,822
I'll never do anything for her again.

148
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,394
I'll never sing with her again.

149
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,389
May 2nd... May 2nd.

150
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,561
They want a new baby.

151
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,568
Why?

152
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,575
What happens to the old one?

153
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,074
Lt' no good because it has asthma?

154
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,406
A new one is born...

155
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,911
...and the other is thrown away?

156
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,857
May 2nd...

157
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,425
That day...

158
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,587
...is the day I am going to die.

159
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,063
"Mother..."

160
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,809
"Those wrinkles were formed..."

161
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,105
"Death to traitors..."

162
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,942
"Maoist triumph..."

163
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:30,354
You're so quiet today, Ms. Cayetana.

164
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:34,459
I have something to tell you.

165
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:39,796
My eyesight is getting worse
and I'll probably have to stop working.

166
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:42,425
I've thought about it a lot and...

167
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:45,899
...I want to be a master cobbler.

168
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:49,668
Do you know what that is?

169
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,673
Yes, the one who fixes shoes.

170
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:56,304
No, the master cobbler
is the one who fixes...

171
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:58,575
...and prolongs the life of the shoes.

172
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:02,983
In other countries, when something
gets old it' thrown out.

173
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,883
Yes, I know.

174
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,685
When my brother is born,
they won't be able to throw me out...

175
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,296
...because I'll already be dead.

176
00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:18,200
No... think of it,
you'll be the older sister.

177
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:22,406
Look Miss... where you see the
key stand.

178
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,701
That' where I want to have my shop.

179
00:17:24,843 --> 00:17:28,279
It will be a gold mine, right Miss?

180
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:30,715
If I count to three...

181
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,681
...my father will come.

182
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:36,512
One... two... three.

183
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:11,785
If I fall, I would die like a hero.

184
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,905
What is this?

185
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,536
A pumpkin.

186
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,377
Ramon Solari.

187
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:45,813
Why do you always come in 3rd place?

188
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,790
Cayetana de los Heros.
Why don't you say hi to your mom?

189
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:54,691
Well... 3rd isn't so bad.
At least they give you a trophy.

190
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,768
4th place... they give you nothing.

191
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:04,365
When are we going to have a telephone?

192
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,674
Soon...

193
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:10,742
We don't have a line yet...
but look, we have a phone.

194
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,015
Someone will forget about me
if I don't call.

195
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:21,053
Ok guys, this is it... exactly like this.

196
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,787
Let' go, get to work.

197
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:27,793
- Got it?
- Yes, yes.

198
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,367
We're building a swimming pool,
just like this one.

199
00:19:30,536 --> 00:19:32,299
It' going to take time and energy.

200
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:34,096
Esweeeming puuul?

201
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:37,535
Very good, my friend.

202
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,574
I know some words in English.

203
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,370
Oh, that' good...

204
00:19:42,614 --> 00:19:45,344
A swimming pool is like
an upside down house.

205
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,315
Can I borrow the ladder?

206
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,783
Lt' very important.

207
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:54,848
Sure, Miss... go ahead.

208
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,361
So how does it feel to know
that you're pregnant?

209
00:19:59,665 --> 00:20:01,792
It all happened very quickly...

210
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,868
...kind of a surprise.

211
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,131
And how did Ramon react?

212
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,363
He was pretty relaxed about it.

213
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:19,850
Cayetana, leave them alone.

214
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,350
You don't even know them.

215
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,316
Of course I know them.

216
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,021
They're my neighbors.

217
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:30,995
Maybe you can make that
wall higher.

218
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,923
How do you know you're pregnant?

219
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,098
What if it' a tumor?

220
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:56,051
I... didn't even come into the kitchen.

221
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,485
That canary has died from sadness.

222
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,251
It couldn't take being alone.

223
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,424
Can animals die from sadness?

224
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,662
Yes, of course.

225
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,424
And people?

226
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:12,966
Yes, I think so.

227
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:22,873
Mothers and fathers who get divorced...

228
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:24,949
...will not go to Heaven.

229
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:30,444
Raise your hands
if your parents are divorced.

230
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:42,024
Ok. If they were good, perhaps...

231
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:46,503
But if they get remarried... Hell.

232
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:50,133
Or some kind of long purgatory...

233
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,530
Mom...

234
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,476
I have bad news...

235
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,808
...you're going to Hell.

236
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,517
Mom...

237
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:47,023
Don't be sad but...

238
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,732
...you're going to Hell.

239
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:00,510
Mom...

240
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,737
...you're not going to Heaven...

241
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,349
...you're going to Hell.

242
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,859
Cayetana... what are you doing?

243
00:23:15,994 --> 00:23:17,052
Nothing.

244
00:23:17,262 --> 00:23:18,695
You've thrown out your food again.

245
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,890
No, I didn't throw away anything.
Hang on...

246
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,506
Are you going to tell my mom?

247
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:36,409
No, I won't tell her. But what was it?

248
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,947
Soup. You open it and it stinks.
Want some?

249
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:39,812
No.

250
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:44,085
Cayetana... I have some extra bread.
Do you want it?

251
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:46,051
Ok.

252
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,390
Are you cutting class?

253
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,052
Yes, Religion.

254
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:53,661
Listen, Jimena...

255
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:59,698
The religion teacher says that divorced
people who remarry won't go to Heaven.

256
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:02,129
Do you think they go to Hell?

257
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,969
No, Cayetana!

258
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,037
Those things don't exist.

259
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,873
You're so dramatic...

260
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,013
I can't tell my mom.

261
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:16,577
But if she gets divorced again...
maybe she'll be saved.

262
00:24:17,022 --> 00:24:19,684
And you... are you cutting class?

263
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:22,758
I had to go to the nurse' office.
I almost fainted.

264
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,996
You almost fainted for real?

265
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:29,024
Oh well... I pretend to faint so that
they carry me like a princess.

266
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:30,598
I faint for real.

267
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,034
Sometimes for real, but
usually you fake it, right?

268
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:38,668
You usually fake it, right?

269
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,606
Yes, almost always.

270
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:45,915
Do you want to play?

271
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:51,219
Let' do "terrorist."

272
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,085
Ok.

273
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:57,989
"Terror-terror-terrorists..."

274
00:24:58,296 --> 00:25:00,059
Less cement, more sand...

275
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:02,923
I'm getting nowhere.

276
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,062
I don't know, the soil is terrible.

277
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:07,928
So, gentlemen...

278
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,369
How is the project coming along?

279
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:16,909
Miss, we have work to do.

280
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,550
Cayetana, we're going to Mass.

281
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,622
I can't, I have asthma.

282
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,731
So you're staying with us this Sunday?

283
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:39,462
No. I'm spending the day with my father.

284
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:44,004
The only way to call your father is if
you come with me and call from town...

285
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:47,709
...which means that you're coming to
Mass, whether you like it or not.

286
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:58,052
I hate waking up early.

287
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,424
I hate going to Mass.

288
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,953
I hate you.

289
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:11,491
<i>Several electrical towers were knocked</i>
down, causing a blackout...

290
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:16,366
<i>Under cover of darkness, the</i>
terrorists attacked private property...

291
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:20,099
<i>... burned shops and harassed vendors.</i>

292
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:21,903
You're not going to Mass?

293
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,372
You're not going to Mass?

294
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:31,852
The thing is at Mass there' a guy
who looks just like Dracula.

295
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:36,357
During the peace-be-with-you part,
he always tries to hug me.

296
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:40,692
There' also these fat women
with sweaty hands.

297
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:45,798
I'm leaving in 30 seconds.

298
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,701
Cain told his brother Abel...

299
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,571
Let' go into the field...

300
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,837
And when they were in the field...

301
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,351
Cain attacked Abel...

302
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,653
...and killed him.

303
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:07,816
God asked Cain...

304
00:27:08,326 --> 00:27:10,351
"What have you done?"

305
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:13,723
"Your brother' blood is crying out."

306
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,932
"From now on you will be cursed."

307
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:26,601
"You'll live far from this fertile land, which
is coated with your brother' blood..."

308
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,837
"...blood that stains your hands."

309
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:38,721
We must have compassion for our
brothers who have lost their way.

310
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,864
I have to go.

311
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:54,401
Mass is ending and there must be
a line for the telephone.

312
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,371
Cayetana, you're not going anywhere.

313
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,843
Please rise.

314
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:03,870
May peace be with you...

315
00:28:03,948 --> 00:28:05,813
And with you...

316
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,481
Let us hug in peace.

317
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:26,063
Dad?

318
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,169
Are you sleeping?

319
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,402
So at what time, then?

320
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,383
At 1:30?

321
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,074
So late?

322
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:48,381
Ok, fine. At 1:30.

323
00:28:49,094 --> 00:28:51,392
But at 1:30, ok?

324
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,392
Bye.

325
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:01,937
May I have 1/2 kilo of rice...

326
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:03,504
...1/2 kilo of sugar...

327
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,801
...and 25 candles, please.

328
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,968
Make that 50 candles.

329
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:32,596
Grey, grey, grey, grey, grey, grey...

330
00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:02,490
Cayetana, come inside.
The sun is too strong.

331
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,962
No.

332
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,360
Lunch is ready, let' go!

333
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:08,972
I'm going to eat with my dad.

334
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:12,066
Cayetana, please come in.

335
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,744
Don't get me in trouble with your mom.

336
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,043
You know your mom doesn't like it when
you're out here. It' too dangerous.

337
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,913
Alicia. Leave it to me.

338
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:24,380
Go serve lunch, please.

339
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:25,987
Yes, ma'am.

340
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,820
Cayetana, what are you doing?

341
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:35,465
Nothing, waiting for the ice cream man.

342
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:42,467
What kind of ice cream man will come
here? We're two hours away from the city.

343
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:44,875
He' not going to come.

344
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,607
Didn't he forget you last Sunday?

345
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,073
Didn't he say he was coming at 1?

346
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:54,748
No. Now that I think about it,
he said he was coming at 2 or 2:30.

347
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,854
No, he said he was coming at 1.

348
00:30:58,556 --> 00:31:01,024
Perhaps there was a lot of traffic.

349
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,891
Yes, of course.

350
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,989
Since there are so many cars...

351
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,498
Cayetana, you've been
waiting for two hours.

352
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,001
Why don't we eat lunch?

353
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,998
No, I'm not hungry.
Besides I want to eat with my dad.

354
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:19,043
I don't understand why you're
so obsessed with your dad.

355
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,877
He doesn't even behave like one.

356
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,075
Do you know who pays for school?

357
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:26,748
No.

358
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:28,441
Do you know who pays for your doctors?

359
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:29,551
No.

360
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:33,953
Well, just so you know, Ramon pays
for everything, not your father.

361
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:38,362
Look a grey car!

362
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,124
Don't forget to take your pills at 5!

363
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,362
Hey kiddo what' up?

364
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:58,980
Hi

365
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,115
Just this once, get in the backseat ok?

366
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,943
If you want, I'll get in the back...

367
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,051
No, don't worry about it...

368
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:10,060
Ok, Cayetana. Let' go, get in.

369
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,762
Hey kiddo, how have you been?

370
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,839
Wow, you've gotten so tall...

371
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:25,105
This is Andrea.

372
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,504
Hi, Cayetana. You're so pretty...

373
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,903
Hi.

374
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:31,373
Look...

375
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,414
...this is Cayetana' first tooth.

376
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,385
- What a lovely tooth...
- Why didn't you come last Sunday?

377
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,955
Because you didn't call.

378
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,050
But there' still no telephone.

379
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:45,055
Oh come on, just give me a hug.

380
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,994
Where' Maria?

381
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,071
No, Maria and I broke up.

382
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,009
What about Pilar?

383
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:05,948
What are you getting at, kiddo?

384
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:10,577
Oh, nothing. But why do I have
to learn all these names...

385
00:33:10,855 --> 00:33:12,686
...if you're never going
to see them again...

386
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,949
...and I'm never going
to see them again.

387
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:18,020
Well, someone' in a bad mood...

388
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:22,528
...so let' turn on the radio and go.

389
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,702
Here we go, here we go...

390
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,600
Grab your tickets, grab your tickets...

391
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,866
Let' go, the guinea pig is getting dizzy...

392
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,532
...round and round, getting dizzy...

393
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,673
Let' see who wins... Here we go!

394
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:47,757
Dad... mom never lets me eat this.
She says it causes cancer.

395
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:50,954
Relax... Your mom is so uptight.

396
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:54,596
Don't worry, you're with me...
We won't say anything to your mom.

397
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:02,663
You want to bet?

398
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,768
No

399
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,663
Pardon me

400
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,579
Do you want to get out?

401
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:48,678
Look if one of you climbs on the other...

402
00:34:48,953 --> 00:34:51,751
...you'll be able to get over the wall.

403
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,893
I'll save you.

404
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:10,736
Run

405
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,770
Run

406
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,739
You're going to die.

407
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,682
Tomorrow you'll wake up in a kettle.

408
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,790
We're leaving in 15 minutes.

409
00:35:44,575 --> 00:35:46,600
Hi, Grandma Carmela.

410
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,301
What are you doing?

411
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,839
Waiting for death to come get me.

412
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,012
Death is coming?

413
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:03,723
What are you reading?

414
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,694
Cayetana!

415
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,354
Death!

416
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:10,398
Here' your milk, Cayetana...

417
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:15,363
The one you like so much... warm milk.

418
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:18,971
Cayetana!

419
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:26,783
Here I am. Don't step on that.

420
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,286
Take your milk, little girl.

421
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,787
You don't like it?

422
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:43,830
Cayetana, let' go.

423
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:48,600
Bye, Herminia. My time is up.

424
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:50,874
Bye, Grandma Carmela.

425
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:01,009
What' that fire?

426
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:03,853
I don't know.
They must be burning trash.

427
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,352
I've seen that symbol before.

428
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,725
It' the hammer and sickle.

429
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:12,727
Are the terrorists coming to kill us?

430
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:14,891
What are you talking about kiddo?

431
00:37:14,999 --> 00:37:16,557
Are you ready for me to win again?

432
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:20,760
I'm winning 4-1... and I know this song!

433
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,405
"Lt' my life..."

434
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:27,067
"What can I do... she chose me..."

435
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,740
"lt' my life...

436
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,108
"lt' not Hell...

437
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,615
"lt' not Paradise either..."

438
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,943
Dad, are you going to pick me
up next Sunday?

439
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,743
Kiddo...

440
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:04,480
I have to take a trip...

441
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,576
...I just remembered.

442
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,750
But I'll be back soon ok?

443
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,785
And since I'll be back
before Christmas...

444
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,049
...maybe we can go to Disneyland...

445
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:18,619
...and I'll buy you the doll you need...
the one with red hair.

446
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:22,424
No, I have that one already.
I need the one in the wheelchair.

447
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,960
Ok.

448
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,667
Give me a hug.

449
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:35,776
I'll fight until I fire my last bullet.

450
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:40,950
And we lost right when
he fired his last bullet.

451
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,720
Where' Isaac?

452
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,953
He' at the doctor, he'll
pick you up after school.

453
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:08,977
Isaac is acting strange.

454
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:11,008
Don't worry, he' fine.

455
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,714
He' old but he' strong.

456
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,546
It' really late.

457
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:23,626
If the traffic lights worked like they do in
any other city, this wouldn't be happening.

458
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:24,760
Sorry, I'm turning here...

459
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:25,693
It' one way!

460
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:27,024
There are fewer cars!

461
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,496
Besides, don't you have assembly
first thing in the morning?

462
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,531
Yes...

463
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,364
So they're going to sing the whole
national anthem. We have time...

464
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:35,996
Shut up, jerk!

465
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:43,012
Are you ok?

466
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,144
Yes.

467
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:52,521
I help addicts. And you?

468
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,948
I run them over.

469
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,757
- Castro...
- Present.

470
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,799
- Cisneros...
- Present.

471
00:40:02,967 --> 00:40:04,832
De los Heros...

472
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,605
Cayetana, pass me one of my pills.

473
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,837
They're in the glove compartment.

474
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,549
Va-li-um...

475
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,922
They're for anxiety.

476
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:38,094
Cayetana... give me your hand. I think I felt it kick.
Can you feel it?

477
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,100
I don't feel anything...

478
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,205
...has it died?

479
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,078
Are you ok?

480
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:51,114
Yes

481
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:54,312
47 minutes late.

482
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,080
A new record. Run, run!

483
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,426
Cayetana de los Heros...

484
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,616
"Oppressed..."

485
00:41:31,455 --> 00:41:34,481
"Chains..."

486
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:38,321
"Condemned..."

487
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:40,860
"Servitude..."

488
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:45,394
While Bolivar was liberating
Ecuador from the North...

489
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,663
...San Martin was liberating Argentina
and Chile from the South.

490
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:55,401
The problem arises when they both want
to declare the independence of Peru.

491
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:59,309
That' where we get the famous
phrase from Bolivar to San Martin:

492
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:03,849
"Two suns cannot shine in one sky."

493
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:09,652
"Two suns cannot shine in one sky."

494
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:15,893
So, Miss Cayetana. How was your day?

495
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:21,500
Look, Isaac. Today my dog was put to sleep
because it was vomiting green blood.

496
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:24,505
And I have asthma, a
migraine and anxiety.

497
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,133
So don't talk to me.

498
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,782
Today there another bomb threat.

499
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,722
We missed math class.

500
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,796
That' great, huh?

501
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,065
Do you want a piece of gum?

502
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,605
No, thank you.

503
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:19,362
If you insist...

504
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:33,470
Oh dear god...

505
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:36,805
Why me, dear god?

506
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:41,510
Don't get out, Miss.

507
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:12,906
Does it hurt to die?

508
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:16,051
Of course it does, Miss.

509
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,612
Ma-ssa-cre.

510
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:55,952
Med-io-cre.

511
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,658
Ramon is mediocre.

512
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:04,391
Yesterday there was a
massacre in Ayacucho.

513
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:07,393
Cayetana, are you done?

514
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,469
Not yet...

515
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:13,343
Come help me in the kitchen
when you're done.

516
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,070
It' for the baby...

517
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:54,975
Money for the baby...

518
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,466
There you go...

519
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:28,884
Do you want to practice the song
we're playing tonight?

520
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,752
Ok.

521
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:35,424
Lift your guitar up.

522
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:02,109
How does it go?

523
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:12,689
You have to stir the batter,
so that there are no lumps.

524
00:47:12,796 --> 00:47:14,923
You see?

525
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,563
Lupe, can you make me a
lemonade please?

526
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,967
One for me, too.

527
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,005
Dont' be scared.

528
00:47:29,146 --> 00:47:31,080
They're fireworks.

529
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:35,474
Alicia... lt' time to prepare the
bread with valium for the dogs.

530
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:36,848
Yes, ma'am.

531
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,421
Those pills again?

532
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,958
You know how nervous they get
in these situations.

533
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,473
Puppy! Dog! Don't eat that!

534
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:03,103
So, Miss. Where are you spending
Christmas Eve?

535
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,111
At my aunt' house.

536
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:10,578
Ready guys?

537
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:12,016
All done.

538
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:16,784
Well, it' not here.

539
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,694
What the hell am I going
to pay the workers with?

540
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,889
Lupe can you come here please?

541
00:48:23,033 --> 00:48:25,695
Did you look in your study?

542
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,928
Do you know anything about the
money that was in this drawer?

543
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,561
No, sir.

544
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,610
Lupe, call Alicia.

545
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:49,757
Cayetana, you took the money
that was in my room.

546
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,519
No.

547
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:05,336
Alicia...

548
00:49:05,475 --> 00:49:07,443
It must have been you.

549
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,703
You're the only one who
cleans the rooms.

550
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,946
No ma'am. I swear it wasn't me.

551
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:15,951
Alicia, I'm losing patience.

552
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:19,954
If the money doesn't appear in 15
minutes, we're going to the police station.

553
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,619
Ma'am...

554
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:25,590
If you want you can check in my room.

555
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:27,354
I have nothing to hide.

556
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,055
Go get your things.

557
00:49:29,399 --> 00:49:32,027
I want you out of here right now.

558
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,802
Please, bear with me...

559
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:42,844
I'll pay you first thing Monday morning.

560
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,379
But you said today.

561
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,812
I have plans tonight...

562
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:50,509
Merry Christmas, guys.

563
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,096
Lupe!

564
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,765
Can you give me a hand, please?

565
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,728
What are you doing here?

566
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,816
It was you, wasn't it?

567
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:04,320
You're in trouble, little girl.

568
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:07,992
You're in trouble.

569
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,734
 <i>Your daughter is a thief.</i>

570
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:13,367
<i>What will happen 10 years from now?</i><i>

571
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,061
<i>That's enough, Ramon.</i>

572
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:17,739
Tonight is Christmas Eve.

573
00:51:18,341 --> 00:51:21,105
And no one can be punished
on Christmas Eve.

574
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:23,269
<i>Cayetana isn't a delinquent.</i>
She's only 8 years old.

575
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:45,959
What should we do?

576
00:51:46,136 --> 00:51:48,536
Don't worry, Ines...

577
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,500
They'll see...

578
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,833
They'll be sorry...

579
00:52:56,907 --> 00:52:59,705
This would be the perfect place...

580
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:03,811
...to entrench and defend ourselves.

581
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:12,048
The Heroes!

582
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,845
Olaya!

583
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,389
Gentlemen...

584
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:17,354
...but the idea isn't to hide.

585
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,792
I'm not moving until I
fire my last shot.

586
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,096
Does it hurt to die?

587
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:27,428
It only hurts in the beginning.

588
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:32,375
What do you have to do
to become a hero?

589
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,375
We're under attack! The Royalists
have discovered us!

590
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,847
Lt' not the Royalists,
it' the terrorists.

591
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:03,930
Oh, Uncle Ramon. Buy something else.

592
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,991
You've finally arrived!

593
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:07,997
What a cute baby!

594
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,130
He looks like you.

595
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,901
No, he looks like his father.

596
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,977
Let' keep singing...

597
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,950
I don't know what else to do with her.

598
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:03,788
That girl has been alone
for a long time.

599
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:08,292
Why don't you leave her with me
for a few months?

600
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:13,491
We're going to the beach tomorrow.
It will be good for Cayetana.

601
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,449
Kill it!

602
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,575
No.

603
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,780
Then open the window and let it go.

604
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:33,820
No.

605
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:40,054
"Flies live for 24 hours."

606
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,054
Cayetana...

607
00:56:42,298 --> 00:56:43,765
Mathematics...

608
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,561
They always place bombs at that time.

609
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:51,095
Also, my dad bought me
a scientific calculator.

610
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,339
Listen, Jimena... why don't we...

611
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,613
...count the number of tombstones
on the highway?

612
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,512
Or why don't we count
red beetle Volkswagens?

613
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,549
Pretty boring...

614
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:08,649
...unless you have to hold your breath
until you see one.

615
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:11,219
That' a wonderful rule!

616
00:57:11,394 --> 00:57:14,727
We'd turn purple from asphyxia!

617
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:19,361
Look at all the dead animals...

618
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:23,435
Why is the sky always white in Lima?

619
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,801
The sky in Lima is always
covered by a white veil.

620
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,101
It always looks like
it' going to rain...

621
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,108
...but it never rains.

622
00:57:34,484 --> 00:57:36,384
Is it blood?

623
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:37,781
Yes.

624
00:57:38,054 --> 00:57:42,548
Well... it' fake blood. My father
couldn't buy the real thing.

625
00:57:47,397 --> 00:57:50,423
One never knows when there
will be a tragedy.

626
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,863
With the Barbies?

627
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:33,636
Let' go!

628
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:15,508
Fly away. But now you're lost...

629
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,746
...and you'll never see
your family again.

630
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,134
Listen, Jimena...

631
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:43,942
...pretend that you're in a canoe and a
volcano has just erupted.

632
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:47,043
So, the water is getting hot...

633
00:59:47,283 --> 00:59:50,684
...and in the canoe it' you,
your father and your mother...

634
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,788
...and you have to kick someone out.

635
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,381
Who would you kick out?

636
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,058
My father because he' a good swimmer.

637
00:59:58,294 --> 01:00:01,286
No... when you kick someone out...

638
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,431
...the piranhas wake up.

639
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,359
Who would you kick out?

640
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:07,898
My mom.

641
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:10,767
But she' going to float with
such a big belly.

642
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:13,908
Then my dad...

643
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:18,104
...even though I think he went to
live in Disneyland.

644
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:31,754
Every year I come and say
I'll climb the sand mountain...

645
01:00:31,894 --> 01:00:33,418
...but I can't.

646
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,425
We have to try.

647
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:51,904
If we get to the top, we'll be heroes...

648
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,548
Or athletes.

649
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,513
Don't be silly, Cayetana...

650
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:58,516
...l'm sure there' just
an old fisherman' hut.

651
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:00,916
Old fisherman' hut?

652
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:03,291
Let' find out.

653
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,355
Jimena! Cayetana!

654
01:01:10,466 --> 01:01:12,058
Come down immediately!

655
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,859
You know that you can't
exert so much energy.

656
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:39,520
Finland...

657
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,887
Finland...

658
01:01:43,499 --> 01:01:46,332
Massacre...

659
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,968
Massacre...

660
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:10,358
Did you hear about the
massacre in Finland?

661
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,024
Finland...

662
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:15,022
Sweetie, it' not in the newspaper.

663
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,424
Where did you hear that?

664
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,933
Oh... nowhere.

665
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:32,473
Hello.

666
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,416
When I die...

667
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:38,043
When I die... l'll come visit you.

668
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:42,053
When I die... l'll visit you every day.

669
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,382
Every day?

670
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,286
What? Does it scare you?

671
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,528
How about...

672
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:52,066
...once a week.

673
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,369
How about every birthday?

674
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,437
No, I've got it... every time you say...

675
01:02:57,707 --> 01:02:59,971
..."Resurrection."

676
01:03:17,493 --> 01:03:19,290
You're don't bleed?

677
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:21,396
So you're a vampire!

678
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,123
Lt' because your stick isn't sharp.

679
01:03:23,232 --> 01:03:24,460
Look at mine.

680
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:26,999
Ouch...

681
01:03:35,011 --> 01:03:39,971
Cayetana! Jimena! Dinner time!

682
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:41,974
Let' go.

683
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:50,482
Guess who came to visit.

684
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,322
What do they do?

685
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,217
They kill everyone.

686
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:29,489
I think they've killed almost
all the policemen.

687
01:04:30,032 --> 01:04:37,666
Jimena... pretend the terrorists tell you that you
can use the letter "J" 100 more times...

688
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,365
...and then they kill you.

689
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:40,975
What would you do?

690
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,778
Because your name starts with "J."

691
01:04:48,084 --> 01:04:50,416
Cayetana?

692
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:10,430
The beach is full, there' no room.

693
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:11,937
It' because it' Sunday.

694
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,837
They look like ants.

695
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,413
Let' hope that the captain
sees the towel.

696
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,712
Why does he need to see the towel?

697
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:27,615
It means that he has to
prepare the boat.

698
01:05:27,790 --> 01:05:29,553
We're going on the boat!

699
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:32,526
The sharks are going to eat us.

700
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,958
Everyone stay together.

701
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,605
Be careful

702
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,605
Come here, Cayetana

703
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,055
Help me, Panchano.

704
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:06,657
Excuse me, kids...

705
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,853
And how is the glass business?

706
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:44,693
I can't complain. With all the bombs...
business is booming.

707
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:49,428
Business in the provinces has tripled...
now we're making bulletproof windows.

708
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:51,664
A neighbor has a candle factory...

709
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,866
...with all the blackouts, his
business is exploding.

710
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:58,345
Either you pay them off, or you
get rich because of their attacks.

711
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:00,774
They've threatened Ramon several times.

712
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:02,006
What is "paying off?"

713
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:03,775
And when is the baby due?

714
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,645
Soon...

715
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,755
It' kicking and moving a lot.

716
01:07:07,923 --> 01:07:10,585
- What is "paying off?"
- The birth is scheduled for May 2nd.

717
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,990
On a holiday?

718
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:15,890
Cayetana, you must be happy that
you're going to have a little brother.

719
01:07:16,732 --> 01:07:19,496
But you'll have a little brother
who will take care of you.

720
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:24,695
How is he going to take care
of me, if I'll always be older?

721
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,040
Pardon me.

722
01:07:30,146 --> 01:07:32,637
Be careful Cayetana.

723
01:07:58,808 --> 01:08:00,469
It' great in here, right?

724
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,804
Yes, no one can bother us.

725
01:08:03,746 --> 01:08:05,611
Are you ok?

726
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,881
Are you scared?

727
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:17,689
Sometimes... when I don't feel well.

728
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:20,688
What scares you?

729
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,730
That it' going to hurt?

730
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:29,697
Listen, Jimena...

731
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,769
Do you want me to tell you a secret?

732
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,940
What is it?

733
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:38,442
When the baby is born...

734
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:41,612
I'm going to die.

735
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,808
You're so silly Cayetana!

736
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:46,687
Those things don't happen.

737
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:48,456
You'll see that you'll love him...

738
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:50,286
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la.

739
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:52,792
...and you won't feel so alone.

740
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,926
You too, Jimena?

741
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,094
You want that baby too.

742
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,804
Cayetana, wait for me.

743
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,873
I'm walking slowly...

744
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,751
Jimena?

745
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:19,080
Are you ok?

746
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,822
Cayetana!

747
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:25,452
Cayetana I'm leaving today...
Come say goodbye.

748
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,623
Say goodbye from me, ok?

749
01:09:42,811 --> 01:09:44,608
Machete...

750
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,507
Machete...

751
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:49,307
Disease...

752
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,345
Disease...

753
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:56,018
- Do you have the car keys? -
Yes, right here.

754
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,848
I'm going to get the elevator.

755
01:09:58,093 --> 01:09:59,560
Can you get up, Jimena?

756
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,327
Yes.

757
01:10:02,264 --> 01:10:04,824
We'll be back soon.

758
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:14,408
Intensive Care?

759
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,846
Ok Mrs. Amalia.

760
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:25,684
Ok. Goodbye Mrs. Amalia.

761
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:32,325
Jimena is still at the hospital.

762
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,924
They still have to run some tests.

763
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:21,602
You are not going to take Jimena.

764
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,980
You can take me if you want...

765
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,646
Better yet, my Grandma Carmela...

766
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:31,445
...who is waiting for death
to come for her.

767
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,988
Do dead people float?

768
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,494
Only for a while...

769
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:49,989
Afterwards, the sharks eat them.

770
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,038
I can't see anything...

771
01:12:57,473 --> 01:12:59,873
In the Nanay River...

772
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:02,000
In the jungle...

773
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:04,545
The water is so muddy...

774
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:08,572
That as time passes,
fish are born blind.

775
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:28,365
No, thank you.

776
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,130
If I reach the top...

777
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:02,029
Jimena will be fine.

778
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,066
If I don't make it...

779
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,134
You take Grandma Carmela.

780
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,926
Mr...

781
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,395
Are you the guardian of Heaven?

782
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,501
Are you a member?

783
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,767
Do you have ID?

784
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:17,602
You have to attack now,
they can't see you.

785
01:15:18,013 --> 01:15:20,004
But we can't see them either.

786
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:21,377
We have to wait.

787
01:15:21,817 --> 01:15:23,978
I have to keep going. Let' go...

788
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:42,168
I don't have a stick.

789
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:47,808
You always forget your things...

790
01:15:49,978 --> 01:15:54,039
I always get the stick that' not sharp.

791
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,388
Your time is up!

792
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:13,696
Blood.

793
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:15,634
You're bleeding?

794
01:16:15,771 --> 01:16:17,739
So you are not a vampire?

795
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:19,498
You're a hero.

796
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:21,676
I will always take care of you.

797
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:24,712
I will always look after you.

798
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,979
Is there anyone home?

799
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:40,913
Cayetana...

800
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:43,917
Here, in the study.

801
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:56,735
The swines took everything, Cayetana.

802
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,504
They took your trophies.

803
01:18:02,377 --> 01:18:06,746
But you still have your paintings...

804
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:11,785
Yes...

805
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,756
Why do you think they left them?

806
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:20,886
I'm sure they had no more room
in their bags.

807
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:22,627
Don't worry...

808
01:18:22,831 --> 01:18:25,356
They'll come back for them another day.

809
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,134
Did you say hi to your mother?

810
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:33,865
No, where is she?

811
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:35,809
Locked in her room.

812
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:37,378
Why is she locked in?

813
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,355
Do you want to bring this too, ma'am?

814
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:50,423
What am I going to do with this child?

815
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:54,828
I never learn.

816
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:59,128
What am I going to do with this baby...

817
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,495
...if I can barely take care of myself...

818
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:05,939
Everything will be ok, you'll see...

819
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,990
Someone left them at the door...

820
01:19:33,135 --> 01:19:34,432
...some of them are dead.

821
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:36,971
Poor little guys...

822
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:39,897
I'll save you, little kittens.

823
01:20:18,013 --> 01:20:23,417
Close my eyes... close my eyes...
open my eyes... open my eyes...

824
01:20:27,522 --> 01:20:29,547
What' going on?

825
01:20:29,691 --> 01:20:31,556
They just want you to be afraid of them.

826
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:33,690
Are you afraid of them?

827
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:36,023
Yes.

828
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:41,526
But it' important to pray.
So that this doesn't get worse.

829
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:52,539
And why do you pray so much
if you're going to Hell anyway?

830
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,545
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

831
01:20:58,019 --> 01:21:00,749
When you are in a dark room...

832
01:21:00,889 --> 01:21:02,948
...and you can't see anything...

833
01:21:03,291 --> 01:21:05,418
Do you open or close your eyes?

834
01:21:05,527 --> 01:21:06,551
What?

835
01:21:06,661 --> 01:21:09,061
In a river with muddy water...

836
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:13,562
...fish are born blind because they
don't use their eye muscles.

837
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:15,292
Who told you that story?

838
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,027
Panchano Zapata.

839
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,699
Well I think that...

840
01:21:21,843 --> 01:21:23,936
...we need to open our eyes...

841
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,673
...because there is always
something to see.

842
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,518
Are you going to leave again?

843
01:21:33,488 --> 01:21:35,479
I don't know...

844
01:21:37,058 --> 01:21:38,548
I think it' Isaac.

845
01:21:38,627 --> 01:21:41,926
Cayetana, don't play with the candles.

846
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:52,266
No, we still don't know where it was...

847
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:54,500
It felt like it was near.

848
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:58,034
Do you guys have electricity?

849
01:21:58,847 --> 01:22:01,509
Tell me... how is Jimena doing?

850
01:22:01,716 --> 01:22:03,513
Does she recognize you?

851
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:07,954
Yes, tomorrow.

852
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,750
I'll talk to you later.

853
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,052
Ramon might be trying to call.

854
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,553
Ok. Take care.

855
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,967
When will I be able to visit Jimena?

856
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:24,801
Not yet, Cayetana.

857
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:25,965
Jimena is very sick.

858
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:27,698
She is in Intensive Care.

859
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:29,002
Ma'am.

860
01:22:29,144 --> 01:22:31,578
The attacks were close by, in Nana.

861
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:35,907
Hello?

862
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:37,313
Ramon!

863
01:22:37,519 --> 01:22:39,419
Are you coming soon?

864
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:42,886
Why don't you stay there.
I'll see you tomorrow.

865
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,069
Your brother' birth was complicated.

866
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:38,403
He has a disease. He is deformed.

867
01:23:38,747 --> 01:23:40,374
Do you want to see him?

868
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:42,445
No, thank you.

869
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:45,142
There is only one way to save him.

870
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:48,321
A blood relative like you...

871
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,425
...must donate their heart,
lungs and eyes.

872
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:53,390
Your parents have agreed.

873
01:23:53,561 --> 01:23:56,257
They have already signed the papers.
- No, Doctor.

874
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:59,558
Besides, I'm adopted.

875
01:23:59,834 --> 01:24:02,098
My organs won't work.

876
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,905
Cayetana...

877
01:24:12,013 --> 01:24:16,074
Your brother is about to be born...
stay here with Lupe ok?

878
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:19,252
You'll come and see us tomorrow.

879
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:03,030
Hello?

880
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:05,027
Hi, Grandpa...

881
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,961
May I speak with Jimena?

882
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,534
Cayetana!

883
01:25:08,670 --> 01:25:11,935
The nurses just finished bathing her
and are putting her to bed.

884
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,801
How are you doing?

885
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:14,872
Fine...

886
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,805
Where is abroad?

887
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:20,311
Lt' a huge country, why?

888
01:25:20,448 --> 01:25:23,281
Some of my friends
moved there forever...

889
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,252
...because their parents were narcs.

890
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:27,945
Narcs?

891
01:25:28,089 --> 01:25:31,718
Hello Cayetana? Lt' Grandma.

892
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,087
Ramon called...

893
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:36,026
The baby is going to be born tonight.

894
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,765
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning, ok?

895
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:52,807
Two suns...

896
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,845
...cannot shine...

897
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:56,914
...in one sky.

898
01:26:02,357 --> 01:26:03,790
Ouch!

899
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,327
I died...

900
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:41,311
No... not yet.

901
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:35,998
If I am alive...

902
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:40,373
...it means that the baby is...

903
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:43,879
...dead.

904
01:28:51,526 --> 01:28:54,586
The baby is cute...

905
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:58,458
A little purple...

906
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:04,495
He got wrapped in the umbilical cord,
but he' fine now.

907
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,477
Do you like the design of his room?

908
01:29:12,046 --> 01:29:15,038
Do you like it?

909
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:24,389
You can't act like nothing is happening...

910
01:29:39,574 --> 01:29:44,034
The time has come.

911
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:59,449
You are so ugly.

912
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:04,928
You know what?

913
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:07,761
I don't love you.

914
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:10,564
And I'll never love you.

915
01:30:13,508 --> 01:30:16,705
Are you scared of vampires?

916
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,481
I am a vampire.

917
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:27,053
Look.

918
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:30,552
I brought you a tarantula...

919
01:30:33,828 --> 01:30:36,695
I am not invisible...

920
01:30:39,333 --> 01:30:41,699
I am not invisible...

921
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:49,502
Well... did you see him?

922
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,769
Yes, we've met.

923
01:30:51,879 --> 01:30:53,107
No, that' not him.

924
01:30:53,314 --> 01:30:55,111
He' in another room.

925
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:57,476
What would you name him?

926
01:30:57,618 --> 01:30:59,347
Who is that?

927
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,679
Come on, let' go.

928
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:04,756
Hello...

929
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,021
Hi, Amalia.

930
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:11,658
Sit down...

931
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,323
Have you seen Ines?

932
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:16,437
No, she is in a very bad mood.
She doesn't want visitors.

933
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,628
She is breast feeding.

934
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:21,636
What did the doctors say
about Jimena, is there any news?

935
01:31:21,776 --> 01:31:24,836
No, nothing. Only that it is serious.

936
01:31:25,012 --> 01:31:26,274
Hi!

937
01:31:26,414 --> 01:31:28,075
Hello!

938
01:31:29,116 --> 01:31:30,276
Flowers?

939
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:31,612
For Ines...

940
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:43,860
Hello?

941
01:31:44,031 --> 01:31:46,727
Hello Francisco. It' Cayetana.

942
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:50,037
Hey kiddo!
How was your vacation?

943
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:54,568
They were ok. But they were in the summer.

944
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:57,335
You went to Disneyland, right?

945
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,069
No...

946
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:00,909
Things got complicated at work...

947
01:32:00,982 --> 01:32:02,313
I have a question...

948
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,042
Is Grandma Carmela breathing?

949
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:06,743
What?

950
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:08,583
I need to know...

951
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:11,317
...if Grandma Carmela is dead...

952
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,426
No... Why?

953
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:15,687
And why are you calling me Francisco?

954
01:32:15,930 --> 01:32:19,661
<i>Please insert coins to continue...</i>

955
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:24,533
What year are we in?

956
01:32:30,177 --> 01:32:33,146
Who is the current president?

957
01:32:34,849 --> 01:32:36,441
Ok...

958
01:32:36,617 --> 01:32:41,054
I want you to touch the tip of
your nose with your left hand.

959
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:51,064
Don't worry. I'll be back, ok?

960
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:01,332
Jimena!

961
01:33:03,044 --> 01:33:04,944
How are you?

962
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:09,045
I'm fine too.

963
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:14,314
You know, I climbed to the
top of the sand mountain...

964
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:16,689
And guess what I found?

965
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:18,458
Just what you said!

966
01:33:18,626 --> 01:33:21,618
An old fisherman in a small hut!

967
01:33:23,130 --> 01:33:25,462
Lupe found some kittens...

968
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:27,795
...but I've already given them some milk.

969
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,342
What else?

970
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:42,113
My mom said you have a disease that
goes away with time...

971
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:45,684
Look at my new inhaler!

972
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:49,723
I don't have to take
those big pills anymore.

973
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:52,517
And I can breathe easily.

974
01:33:57,398 --> 01:33:59,025
My brother was born...

975
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,734
...and look, I'm still alive.

976
01:34:02,803 --> 01:34:04,794
Brother...

977
01:34:37,004 --> 01:34:40,462
Jimena...

978
01:34:41,075 --> 01:34:44,841
You are my favorite person
in the world.

979
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:48,439
You have to get better quickly, ok?

980
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:54,013
I'll be right back.

981
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:11,465
Poor Tupac Amaru...

982
01:36:11,665 --> 01:36:13,963
They've quartered him...

983
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:16,629
We're running low on ammunition.

984
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:19,899
Quiet, please...
we don't want to be caught.

985
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:22,108
I must protect these letters.

986
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:26,037
I have to find a way out.

987
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:30,944
How can we defeat an enemy
that is five times bigger than us?

988
01:36:31,318 --> 01:36:33,946
You don't know what happened, do you?

989
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:52,063
Is this supposed to be me?

990
01:36:53,007 --> 01:36:54,474
We lost...

991
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,701
We have experience in battles...

992
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:58,310
...in losing them all.

993
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:03,649
What are we going to do now?

994
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:07,810
If you want you can stay in my house...
I have a pool.

995
01:37:08,222 --> 01:37:10,452
Let' go gentlemen.

996
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:13,024
It' time to face our destiny.

997
01:37:13,294 --> 01:37:14,556
Are you coming with us?

998
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,391
No, I can't.

999
01:37:16,630 --> 01:37:19,463
I have to meet my brother.

1000
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,430
There is no time to lose.

1001
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:24,570
It' time to attack.

1002
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:28,970
From one defeat to the other...
Victory will be ours.

1003
01:37:31,045 --> 01:37:34,742
No, don't go yet...

1004
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:37,474
I can't. I have to go with them.

1005
01:37:39,019 --> 01:37:42,318
Yes, I know, but... where are the letters?

1006
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,048
No...

1007
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:46,559
...I ate them.

1008
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:49,694
Yes, I know you ate them. But...

1009
01:37:49,930 --> 01:37:52,728
Did you read them before eating them?

1010
01:37:53,100 --> 01:37:54,761
What did they say?

1011
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:56,766
That it was time to attack?

1012
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:58,802
Retreat?

1013
01:37:59,073 --> 01:38:00,563
Surrender?

1014
01:38:00,741 --> 01:38:03,335
Or were they so wet that
you couldn't understand anything?

1015
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:06,012
No, no... It' not that.

1016
01:38:06,347 --> 01:38:08,406
So what is it?

1017
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:20,521
I don't know how to read.

1018
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:07,573
Two suns cannot shine in one sky...

1019
01:39:49,516 --> 01:39:51,882
Breathe baby...

1020
01:39:52,987 --> 01:39:55,956
Breathe baby, breathe.

1021
01:40:01,662 --> 01:40:04,062
Come on, breathe...

1022
01:40:15,876 --> 01:40:17,935
You can't be in here!

1023
01:40:18,112 --> 01:40:20,046
Go on...

1024
01:40:41,769 --> 01:40:44,329
It' a sedative...

1025
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:49,599
You'll feel better with this.

1026
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:52,041
Get some rest...

1027
01:40:56,784 --> 01:40:58,809
Cayetana...

1028
01:41:00,654 --> 01:41:03,316
What' that smell outside?

1029
01:41:03,791 --> 01:41:05,588
Are there flowers?

1030
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:07,859
Yes, a lot...

1031
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:12,264
But I'll throw them in the trash,
just the way you would.

1032
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:15,531
Thank you.

1033
01:41:15,803 --> 01:41:18,033
You know how much I hate those things.

1034
01:41:28,649 --> 01:41:30,446
Have you seen him?

1035
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,719
Yes...

1036
01:41:33,287 --> 01:41:34,447
Come here...

1037
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:36,350
Cayetana, come closer.

1038
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:45,387
Come closer... sit down.

1039
01:41:57,444 --> 01:42:00,072
Look at this cut on your finger...

1040
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:20,330
And your kittens?

1041
01:42:21,168 --> 01:42:22,760
They are ok...

1042
01:42:25,873 --> 01:42:29,775
What can we do
to make you smile more often?

1043
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:17,085
Cayetana...

1044
01:43:17,691 --> 01:43:19,454
Cayetana...

1045
01:43:19,927 --> 01:43:21,986
Cayetana...

1046
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:34,967
Isaac...

1047
01:44:39,306 --> 01:44:41,740
Are you Miss Cayetana?

1048
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:45,739
I am Justino...
Your new driver and bodyguard.

1049
01:44:48,515 --> 01:44:50,346
Why is everything so dark?

1050
01:44:50,617 --> 01:44:53,950
They're the new tinted windows
that Mr. Ramon had installed.

1051
01:44:54,254 --> 01:44:58,088
They are bullet-proof, bomb-proof
and kidnapping-proof...

1052
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,858
They look like mirrors
from the outside...

1053
01:45:01,128 --> 01:45:02,993
...they can't see you.

1054
01:45:03,463 --> 01:45:05,693
They can't see me?

1055
01:45:10,504 --> 01:45:12,438
Where is Isaac?

1056
01:45:13,507 --> 01:45:15,099
Is he still sick?

1057
01:45:15,709 --> 01:45:17,370
I think...

1058
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:19,775
...the old man died.

1059
01:45:20,881 --> 01:45:22,974
Poor old man...

1060
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:30,818
Don't cry Cayetana...

1061
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:34,687
You hate Isaac...

1062
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:37,591
Don't cry Cayetana...

1063
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:43,886
I am not invisble!

1064
01:46:45,699 --> 01:46:49,260
I am not invisble!
