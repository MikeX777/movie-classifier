00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,638
- [Narrator] You are about
 to witness the Super Awesome

2
00:00:05,671 --> 00:00:07,607
Story of Mark and Gary.

3
00:00:08,874 --> 00:00:12,578
From the very beginning,
they had big dreams.

4
00:00:12,611 --> 00:00:15,648
But they didn't just build
  extraordinarily large

5
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:17,116
Lego castles, no.

6
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:22,055
As teenagers, they discovered
 a love for the arts.

7
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:24,724
It was a passion that
 fueled them both.

8
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:28,327
Plus, they also got to
have sweet sword fights.

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,864
Time passed and they
  grew older, but they were

10
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:35,535
still inseparable, and
  Mark's grandma was always

11
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:37,303
there to support.

12
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:40,205
They continued to push
  the boundaries of theater.

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,608
Their Hamlet with a Down
syndrome Chinese boy

14
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,812
as Ophelia earned them
 national recognition.

15
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:49,482
But, they weren't the
only ones making waves.

16
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:52,652
An ex lawyer, Fairfax
  Ward, was quickly becoming

17
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,655
the new face of edgy
 political theater.

18
00:00:55,688 --> 00:00:59,292
Mark and Gary thought
 he was a total dick.

19
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:01,894
They both loved dogs,
 too, and would make

20
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:04,497
a bit of money in their
 down time with a dog walking

21
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,032
business.

22
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,935
They used this quiet time to
 come up with their next hit,

23
00:01:08,968 --> 00:01:12,372
and boy did they come
 up with a next hit.

24
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:16,008
Gilded Lilies was
  totally awesome.

25
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,978
A gay love story they
 wrote and directed.

26
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,848
It was a hit with
 audiences around the world.

27
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:26,352
They were being courted
by producers and
studios everywhere.

28
00:01:26,385 --> 00:01:29,922
This success allowed them
 to create work with meaning

29
00:01:29,955 --> 00:01:32,459
and drink super sweet whiskey.

30
00:01:33,826 --> 00:01:37,095
But they held down their
 jobs at lifelong friend Deb's

31
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:38,598
comic book shop.

32
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,634
They got to play with
  toys whenever they wanted,

33
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:43,803
which was pretty sweet.

34
00:01:43,836 --> 00:01:47,373
Sometimes, greatness is
thrust upon the least

35
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,342
likely of people.

36
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,546
In a world that demands change,
equality, and celebration,

37
00:01:54,513 --> 00:01:56,916
leaders are required.

38
00:01:56,949 --> 00:02:00,853
Mark and Gary had no idea
  what lay around the corner

39
00:02:00,886 --> 00:02:02,121
for them.

40
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:04,056
Over to you, boys.

41
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:07,827
- Who are you to stand here
 on stolen soil and tell us

42
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,929
that we can't come here?

43
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,497
Racist.

44
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,032
War.

45
00:02:13,065 --> 00:02:16,136
It is also bad, we
  have Frankenstein.

46
00:02:17,169 --> 00:02:18,238
But I am you.

47
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:25,912
- Listen, Dostoevsky
  tomorrow night, directing.

48
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,146
So listen.

49
00:02:27,179 --> 00:02:28,681
I'm only getting 17 cats
into that dilapidated

50
00:02:28,714 --> 00:02:31,083
converted jail, I want
 you two to be there.

51
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,318
What do you say?
  - Great, love to.

52
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,586
- Cheers, yeah,
  yeah, yeah, yeah.

53
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:35,454
Deals with the rejection
of utopian socialism.

54
00:02:35,487 --> 00:02:36,956
What were you guys saying?

55
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,158
- Refugees struggling--
  - Love your African's abs.

56
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,693
That shit's smart.

57
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:52,705
Yeah, yeah.

58
00:02:55,774 --> 00:02:58,544
Can't get enough of that shit.

59
00:02:58,577 --> 00:03:00,780
Tomorrow night, that
 shit will be on tap.

60
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:01,648
Yo.

61
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,420
- Hey, guys.
 - Hey, hey.

62
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,156
- Oh, guys, that was
 just, I don't know.

63
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:11,691
Wow.

64
00:03:11,724 --> 00:03:12,959
- Thanks, Deb.
 - Thanks, Deb.

65
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,094
- Alan fucking brung it.
- Yeah, it was awesome.

66
00:03:15,127 --> 00:03:16,229
- Great.

67
00:03:16,262 --> 00:03:19,432
What are you looking at?
- Racism is bad.

68
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,900
- [Both] It is.

69
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:22,234
- Nothing better than
  two white boys telling me

70
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,736
how hard it is to be black.

71
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,004
- Oh, dude, that's not--
  - Just yanking your wang.

72
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:26,505
It was shit, though.

73
00:03:26,538 --> 00:03:29,976
- Thanks, appreciate it, man.
 - I'm white.

74
00:03:34,313 --> 00:03:35,113
- All right here we go.

75
00:03:35,147 --> 00:03:36,548
Here we go, mate.

76
00:03:41,887 --> 00:03:42,722
- Wanker.

77
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:48,728
Oh, man.

78
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:53,199
Every Rocky movie after
 the original was critically

79
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:55,067
panned and yet the
  franchise has grossed over

80
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,569
a billion dollars.
  - OK, firstly,

81
00:03:56,602 --> 00:03:58,504
we'll be lucky to make a
 hundred bucks with our play,

82
00:03:58,537 --> 00:04:01,340
secondly, Rocky is
 a dumb action movie.

83
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:03,009
- It's not a dumb action movie.

84
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:05,077
It's one of the most beautiful
 love stories ever told.

85
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,446
- No, no, PS I Love
 You is a love story.

86
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,949
Rocky is not a love story,
  it's an action movie.

87
00:04:09,982 --> 00:04:11,350
- Are you retarded?
 - No.

88
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:13,219
Rocky is a movie about
 a retarded boxer.

89
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,821
Adrian, Adrian.
 - It's a metaphor for life.

90
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:17,256
- Yeah, but it's the
 only metaphor you

91
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:18,690
use for anything ever.
 - Yeah, there's

92
00:04:18,724 --> 00:04:19,991
a reason for that.
 - Whatever, let's just agree

93
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:21,726
to disagree.
 - Fine.

94
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,728
- Hey guys.

95
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:23,729
- Hey, Deb.
- Looking good.

96
00:04:23,762 --> 00:04:25,298
- Thanks.

97
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,365
- What's up, fellas?

98
00:04:26,398 --> 00:04:27,566
Disturbance in the force?

99
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:29,468
- The review, she
 gave it one out of 10.

100
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,870
- She's lame.

101
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,505
She's a middle school
 coordinator of Lameville High.

102
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,374
Hey, I was watching some
 Robert Kiyosaki on YouTube,

103
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:37,376
and he said something
about first one through

104
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,811
the wall gets a bit bloodied.

105
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:40,680
- Didn't he just go bankrupt?

106
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,316
- Keep fighting the good fight.

107
00:04:46,652 --> 00:04:48,154
- I've had worse reviews.
  - Often times,

108
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:50,289
the first one through the
  wall gets a bit bloodied.

109
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:52,224
- You guys suck.

110
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,926
- Whatever, sugars.

111
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:55,294
- Hey, bring it, OK?

112
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:56,962
Paying audience, bring it.

113
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,632
(hip hop music)

114
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,377
- Hi.
 - Hey, glad you could make it.

115
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,511
- Are you kidding?

116
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:15,046
We fucking love Dostoevsky.

117
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,317
(dramatic music)

118
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,453
- Let's go in.
 - Let's go.

119
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:25,091
(rock music)

120
00:05:30,028 --> 00:05:32,031
- Is that Jack Simpson?
- Fuck yeah.

121
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,999
- Do you want to meet him?
  - Serious?

122
00:05:34,032 --> 00:05:36,234
- Yeah, yeah, no worries.
  - Hey, Jack.

123
00:05:36,268 --> 00:05:37,635
Jack, hey.

124
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:38,938
It's Mark.

125
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,639
- Hey, Gary.

126
00:05:40,672 --> 00:05:41,874
Gaza.

127
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:43,241
Gilded Lilies.
 - Yeah, right.

128
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:44,777
How are you doing guys?
- Good.

129
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,379
- Been a while, yeah?
 - Not that long.

130
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:48,147
Just we know each other.
- Yeah, hey, look,

131
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,715
this is Violet and Paige.

132
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:53,919
- Can I just say I loved
you in Legal Murder?

133
00:05:53,952 --> 00:05:56,822
- Sorry, and West Side Story.

134
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:59,425
You like, such masculinity and--

135
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,593
- Thanks, ladies.

136
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:02,294
You guys catch Gilded Lilies?

137
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,797
These guys were absolutely
  incredible in that.

138
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,699
I mean, seriously, honest work.

139
00:06:06,732 --> 00:06:08,000
And that kiss, guys.

140
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,369
It totally broke me, yeah?

141
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:12,171
You doing a film
 version or something?

142
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:13,672
- Yeah, we've written it.
 - Some producers optioned it.

143
00:06:13,705 --> 00:06:16,207
- Yes, it's in the works,
  but what are you up to?

144
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:18,344
You must be filming and like
 doing all sorts of cool--

145
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:21,214
(melodic honking)

146
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,888
- Jack fucking Simpson.

147
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,156
(laughing)

148
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,590
- Fairfax fucking Ward.

149
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:33,692
- Jack Simpson in the flesh,
 as I live and breathe.

150
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,761
The jewel in our artistic world.

151
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:38,697
(laughing)

152
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,832
Oh, man.

153
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:41,534
Look at you.
- Hey, Fairfax.

154
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,935
- Hey, Mack, Guy.

155
00:06:42,968 --> 00:06:44,270
- It's Mark.
 - Gary.

156
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:47,506
- My God, come here,
 come here, come here.

157
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:48,741
Oh, man.

158
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:49,708
- Didn't I tell you I'd come?

159
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:52,178
(chattering)

160
00:06:54,813 --> 00:06:55,848
- You look beautiful, man.

161
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:57,215
Thank you, thank you.

162
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,452
- Since that nightmare.
- Don't even talk about,

163
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,786
I can't even laugh about that.

164
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,154
I can't even laugh about that.

165
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:04,890
- Worst show ever.
 - That shit you showed

166
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,525
last time might
 have won that prize.

167
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:08,394
- Oh, sorry, we don't
  make undies for a living.

168
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,429
- Carl and Shay have an
 underwear line specifically

169
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,198
for the contemporary gay.

170
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,099
- Soft men's wear.
 - Expanding into the lesbian

171
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:15,234
market next spring.

172
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:17,170
- I'll keep an eye out.

173
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:20,940
- No tweeting at the table.

174
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,441
- Fuck off you fat
 fucking orange face.

175
00:07:22,474 --> 00:07:23,709
- You know I hate that shit.

176
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,144
- Twitter's for nerds.
 - No, it's hands down

177
00:07:25,177 --> 00:07:27,746
the best social media platform,
it is an all access pass.

178
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,114
Anything's possible.

179
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,582
- Jay's like God
  in Twittersphere.

180
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,051
He's got a million followers.

181
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,752
- One point one million, fat.
 - Why are you so popular?

182
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,288
- I am an entrepreneur.

183
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,123
- Fuck off, you
  make undies, man.

184
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:39,992
- Fuck off, you walk dogs.
  - You walk dogs?

185
00:07:40,025 --> 00:07:41,527
- No.
- When he's not

186
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,628
selling comics.

187
00:07:42,661 --> 00:07:44,497
- You sell comics.

188
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,299
- Better than undies, right?
 - Those undies got us a two

189
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,169
bedroom apartment in
 the heart of the city.

190
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:51,971
Meanwhile, you two drag
 your dicks along the ground,

191
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,305
don't do nothing.

192
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,540
- Really, I've got so many--
 - Stay.

193
00:07:54,573 --> 00:07:56,407
- I need to learn some
 lines for tomorrow.

194
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:59,979
- I'll call you, I'll call
 you, I'll call you tomorrow.

195
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:01,581
- So, I'll text ya.

196
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,216
- You know that's like the
  hottest, they're the most

197
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,619
beautiful women.
 - Those fucking girls.

198
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,753
They were so hot.
 - Was that supposed

199
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:10,522
to be Al Pacino?
  - It is Al Pacino,

200
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,892
mother fucker.
- No, it's about hu-ah.

201
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,093
She got a great ass.

202
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,828
- She got a great personality.

203
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:18,497
- She got a great dress on.

204
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,700
- She got a great recipe
for a muesli bar slice.

205
00:08:21,733 --> 00:08:25,104
- She got a great set of
  shoes that are orthopedic

206
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,906
and don't give her back pain.

207
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:28,707
- Let's go play Twister.
- I'm hungry.

208
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,642
- [Shay] Man, you've already had

209
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,576
like four fucking Pad Thais.

210
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:31,810
- Well, I'm a big boy, aren't I?

211
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,212
- Fuck yeah you are.
 - It's not fucking

212
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,947
porn Twister.

213
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,449
(beeping)

214
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:38,317
Game off.

215
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:42,588
- What an angel.

216
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,823
Listen to her message.
 - Who?

217
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:46,025
- My niece.

218
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,360
- Meh.
  - What do you mean, &quot;Meh&quot;?

219
00:08:48,393 --> 00:08:50,296
- I mean, &quot;Meh,&quot; kids, whatevs.

220
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,497
What, it's not like it's yours.

221
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,165
- It's my niece, bro.

222
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:55,367
- OK, rolling.

223
00:08:57,669 --> 00:08:59,138
- Hello, Muffy.

224
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,173
You look even more beautiful
 than the real Snow White.

225
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:03,776
- And she is hot.
  - Happy birthday, sweetie.

226
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,343
Wish I was there.

227
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:08,646
Now here's my friends to
 say something very special.

228
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,949
(coughing)

229
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:12,785
- Muffy.

230
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:14,887
Hi, I'm Gary, you're little.

231
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,823
Don't forget, you can't
  be in your princess shoes

232
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,858
after midnight,
 it's time to change.

233
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,828
- It's not Cinderella.
 - We're all the same.

234
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:25,931
Cinderella, Snow
 White, Darth Vader.

235
00:09:25,964 --> 00:09:28,300
Oh, and don't eat
  too much sugar.

236
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,735
It's the baddest.

237
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,005
- Hey, Fluffy.

238
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:36,775
I think it's really sad that
 Snow White ate the red apple

239
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,811
and went to sleep for so long.

240
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:41,013
It makes me really sad.

241
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:43,983
I really think we should
do something about it.

242
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,185
I hope your life isn't
 doomed like hers.

243
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,254
- She's two, you fucking morons.

244
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:53,125
- All right, I didn't know you
 were like into kids and shit.

245
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,660
- I love her, have some respect.

246
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,495
- [Gary] Well, if you love
  'em so much, get your own.

247
00:09:56,528 --> 00:09:57,763
- Maybe we will.

248
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:58,597
(coughing)

249
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,465
- What?

250
00:09:59,498 --> 00:10:00,433
Like adopt?

251
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,369
Do you guys want to get married?

252
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:04,837
- Well, it's not that easy.
 - Especially with your dad.

253
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,872
Fucking conservative coconut.

254
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:09,608
You fat fucking islander.

255
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,977
- Actually, that's
  not a bad idea.

256
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,212
- What?

257
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,180
- Like, a couple of,
 like a play, you know?

258
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:17,483
Like a musical, there's
like a couple of guys

259
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:21,587
that want to get
married, but they can't.

260
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,122
- Yeah, fuck yeah.

261
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:26,425
Like anti marriage shit.

262
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:30,429
Equality stigma.
- Family full of haters.

263
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:33,866
- Fucking chuck in a Chinese
 kid that's fucking adopted.

264
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,703
- You know, just crack open
 what it's like for you gays,

265
00:10:37,736 --> 00:10:39,004
you guys.
- They could have AIDs,

266
00:10:39,037 --> 00:10:42,675
one of 'em.
 - Or it could be like Glee.

267
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,043
- What, a musical?

268
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,377
- Fuck yeah.
 - Fuck yeah.

269
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,079
- Fuck yeah, mm hmm.

270
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:50,249
- That's actually
 not a bad idea, boys.

271
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,751
Except for the AIDs part.
  - It's current.

272
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,218
- Nah, musicals are expensive.

273
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:56,155
- Fuck that, when
  I get my docko--

274
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,289
- Here we go.

275
00:10:58,156 --> 00:10:59,590
- No, no, no, OK.

276
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,226
I raised--
- 75,000 through

277
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,661
crowd sourcing, we know.

278
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,128
- Listen, morons.

279
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:06,198
Most of the gay community
  still remember you two

280
00:11:06,231 --> 00:11:07,633
from the Gilded Lilies.

281
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,934
You have an in.

282
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:14,473
There's money to be made
in something like this.

283
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:20,779
- [Woman] I love you,
but I can't be with you.

284
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:22,247
You're my brother.

285
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,882
- [Narrator] Next week
 on Days of Our Lives,

286
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:26,752
Neville McBebee guest stars.

287
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:30,021
(chattering, laughing)

288
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,360
- Man, Neville McBebee.
- The Bebe.

289
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,129
- [Gary] Grandma.

290
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:38,931
- Gary and I got a beard on
 Ebay for this Darth Vader

291
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,133
suit, and it's like a
  full replica from on set.

292
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:43,001
- Yeah, it's like
  directly from the movies.

293
00:11:43,034 --> 00:11:44,670
- Helmet, chest plate.
 - You wouldn't know.

294
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,938
It's like you're in the movie.

295
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,306
- It's an original replica.

296
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:49,108
Because we've had an idea.
  - Yeah, right.

297
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,209
So, it's this one man
 show with Darth Vader,

298
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,712
kind of post the Death
  Star exploding, him having

299
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:55,247
to reconnect.
- A story of redemption.

300
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,382
- Find his wife again.
 - It's beautiful.

301
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,916
It's beautiful.

302
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,419
There's some really honest
  moments with Darth Vader

303
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:01,987
just confessing about all
  the bad shit he's done.

304
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,990
- My life is ruined.
- I didn't have a daddy

305
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,625
and that's why I
was mean to you.

306
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:08,761
- I found a business card
  on the Emperor's desk

307
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,063
for a psychiatrist,
 I should go see him.

308
00:12:11,096 --> 00:12:12,698
- Anyway, basically,
 what we need is--

309
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,467
- OK, how much?
- $50.

310
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:19,704
- Done.

311
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,240
- Cool, hey, cool.

312
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:23,175
- Thank you.

313
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,377
Thank you.

314
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,112
- This looks lovely.

315
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:29,081
- That cream's awesome.

316
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:31,717
Mm.
 - Thank you.

317
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,352
I read your review.

318
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:39,224
You're not getting
  any younger, boys.

319
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:40,358
Neither am I.

320
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,501
(hip hop music)

321
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:54,106
(groaning)

322
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,309
- Fuck.

323
00:12:57,342 --> 00:12:59,745
(laughing)

324
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,981
- Hey, hey.
- Sup, dickhead?

325
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,516
- I've been looking for
you boys everywhere.

326
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,552
- Well, why?
- What the fuck is that?

327
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,786
- It's a dog.
 - Shar Pei.

328
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:08,687
- Bear coat.

329
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,521
(barking)

330
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:10,756
- Honey I'm Homeless.

331
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,757
- What, did you and
 Carl have a fight?

332
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,991
- What?

333
00:13:13,024 --> 00:13:14,159
No, I didn't have
  a fucking fight.

334
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:15,294
Just shut up.

335
00:13:17,062 --> 00:13:17,897
Watch it.

336
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:21,266
- Hi, I'm Gary.
- I'm Mark.

337
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,802
- [Narrator] Are you tired
  of being told your love

338
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:25,871
is inferior?
  - I think it's really sad.

339
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:27,606
- It's the baddest.

340
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,842
- [Narrator] How does it
 feel when someone questions

341
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,244
your ability to
  raise your child?

342
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:33,111
- Watch it.

343
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:34,379
- Watching.

344
00:13:34,412 --> 00:13:36,415
- [Narrator] Love
  has no boundaries.

345
00:13:36,448 --> 00:13:39,483
How can we be so progressive
 as a global society,

346
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:43,021
but still apply these
  ancient, desert prejudices

347
00:13:43,054 --> 00:13:45,924
to our lives?
 - We're all the same.

348
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:48,126
- [Narrator] What will
  our children say about us,

349
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,928
when they look back
 at us this time?

350
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:52,231
- I really think we should
  do something about it.

351
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,132
- [Narrator] Well you can.

352
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,601
Honey, I'm Homeless.

353
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,103
A new stage musical, dealing
 with marriage equality

354
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,606
through hilarious and
  heartbreaking relationship

355
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,176
of two men just
 living a true life.

356
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,613
It's time to stand up,
donate your small change

357
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,048
for a big change.

358
00:14:10,415 --> 00:14:11,550
- Don't forget.

359
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,587
- [Narrator] Together,
 we will rise.

360
00:14:16,554 --> 00:14:19,124
- OK, so, long story
  short, did a bag of coke,

361
00:14:19,157 --> 00:14:21,159
whipped this up last
  night, got it online about

362
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:23,829
nine hours ago, get
 it up on Twitter.

363
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,796
You boys went viral.

364
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,699
Ellen DeGeneres retweeted us.

365
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:28,967
Oh, and there's more.

366
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,769
You boys make 250K.

367
00:14:30,802 --> 00:14:31,937
- K what?

368
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,438
- Dollars.
  - $250?

369
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,008
- Thousand.
  - I don't get it.

370
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:36,976
- $250,000.

371
00:14:39,177 --> 00:14:42,114
Gays everywhere went hard
  and wet simultaneously

372
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,316
and have given you cash money.

373
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:45,484
- No.
 - Bullshit.

374
00:14:45,517 --> 00:14:46,718
- Fact.

375
00:14:46,751 --> 00:14:48,185
- Shay, we've never
 written a musical.

376
00:14:48,219 --> 00:14:49,421
- Let alone a gay one.

377
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,989
- Fact, every musical is gay.

378
00:14:52,023 --> 00:14:55,227
Fact, you two wrote Gilded
 Lilies, the gayest play ever.

379
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,029
- But Shay, that's
  totally fucking different.

380
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,130
- Shut up.

381
00:14:58,163 --> 00:14:59,698
OK, this is amazing.

382
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:01,066
You two are brilliant.

383
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:03,235
Do you guys want to walk
dogs and polish He-Man

384
00:15:03,268 --> 00:15:04,403
until you're 70?

385
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:05,271
OK.

386
00:15:08,206 --> 00:15:09,041
Shh.

387
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:14,046
This could change your lives.

388
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:17,215
Fact.

389
00:15:17,248 --> 00:15:18,851
Shit just got real.

390
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,589
- [Both] Fuck yeah.

391
00:15:25,657 --> 00:15:28,327
(hip hop music)

392
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,611
- See ya later.
- Let's go.

393
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,563
- [Narrator] Appears to
 have made history when their

394
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,465
gay marriage musical,
 Honey I'm Homeless,

395
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,866
received over $250,000--

396
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,901
- We've got to do some research.

397
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:12,204
(gargling)

398
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:15,841
- ET phone home.

399
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,610
- Mine sounds better.
 - I think it does.

400
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:19,979
- ET phone home.

401
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:22,681
- ET phone home.

402
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,217
- It sounds shit, mine
  sounds way better, listen.

403
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:27,185
ET phone home.

404
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:30,055
- You just said it like a kid
 doing a bad ET impression.

405
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,790
(laughing)

406
00:16:31,823 --> 00:16:33,091
It does.

407
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:33,959
Let's go.

408
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,333
Oh, Philadelphia.
  - Nice.

409
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,305
Short Bus?
 - Yeah, yeah, sweet.

410
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,741
Oh, yeah, Top Gun.
 - No, it's not gay.

411
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,777
- Dude, that volleyball
scene, oiled up bodies,

412
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,744
it's like life partner
 with a poodle gay.

413
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:55,447
- That's more about
 the style of the '80s.

414
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,748
- [Gary] I really don't
think so, little buddy.

415
00:16:56,781 --> 00:16:57,983
That's pretty damn gay.

416
00:16:58,016 --> 00:16:58,516
- Fine, I'm getting
 Lord of the Rings.

417
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,284
- What?

418
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,519
That's not gay.

419
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,319
- [Mark] Samwise and
 Frodo were boning,

420
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:02,587
all the way to Mordor.

421
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,056
- Dude, they were
  destroying a ring.

422
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:05,490
- Metaphor, they were
  throwing their homosexual

423
00:17:05,522 --> 00:17:06,757
desires into a hole.
  - That's the dumbest thing

424
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,992
I've ever heard, man.

425
00:17:08,026 --> 00:17:09,061
- I read it online.
 - Yeah, whatever.

426
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:09,995
- It was a forum.

427
00:17:10,028 --> 00:17:12,931
It's called Lord of the Ring.

428
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:15,567
(gentle music)

429
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:21,373
(phone ringing)

430
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:25,043
- Yo, what's up, man, hey.
  - Sup?

431
00:17:25,076 --> 00:17:26,245
How's writing?

432
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,617
- Slow.
 - There's no pressure.

433
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,086
You've got heaps of time.

434
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,822
- Yeah, it's just like, it's
 not our world, you know?

435
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:40,058
We don't know anything
 about it, dude.

436
00:17:40,091 --> 00:17:42,526
- All right, get hot, put
  something in your hair,

437
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,331
I'm coming over, we're
 gonna find some inspiration.

438
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:49,034
(hip hop music)

439
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,265
OK, Mark, Stonewall.

440
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:22,533
Gary, Tool Shed.

441
00:18:22,567 --> 00:18:23,435
Come on out.

442
00:18:23,468 --> 00:18:25,471
- Enjoy your date night.

443
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:31,743
Meet you back here in an hour?
 - Yeah.

444
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,149
(muffled music)

445
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:54,700
- Ax?
- Yeah.

446
00:18:57,268 --> 00:18:59,271
- I used to watch you play.
 - Really?

447
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,306
- I'm your biggest fan.
- Cheers, man.

448
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:03,707
That was another life.
 - Yeah.

449
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:06,178
Can I grab you a beer?
 - Yeah.

450
00:19:07,512 --> 00:19:10,215
(dubstep music)

451
00:19:10,248 --> 00:19:11,850
- Honey I'm Homeless.
 - Yeah.

452
00:19:11,883 --> 00:19:14,452
- Oh, that video
 made me cry so hard.

453
00:19:14,485 --> 00:19:15,986
I donated a 50.

454
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,756
So, you get your
  ass in here, boy.

455
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:18,956
You give or take?

456
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,559
You're not on campus
 anymore, baby.

457
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:21,459
- I didn't think I was.

458
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:23,094
No, no, I'm gonna.

459
00:19:23,127 --> 00:19:24,729
- So, what was Cement like?

460
00:19:24,762 --> 00:19:26,831
- Hands down the best car owner.

461
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:29,468
- What about GT?
- He's a prick.

462
00:19:31,569 --> 00:19:33,238
I saw that video, by the way.

463
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:36,707
- All right, what did you think?

464
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:38,610
- I think you're
  playing with fire.

465
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,145
- How do you mean?

466
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:43,315
- Mate, marriage is forever.

467
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,149
You'd be hard pressed
  pinning down any of mates

468
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:49,054
for two minutes, let
 alone a lifetime.

469
00:19:49,087 --> 00:19:50,855
- OK, really, I've got to go.

470
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:52,890
- So young.
 - I'm 30.

471
00:19:52,924 --> 00:19:55,327
- You wouldn't tell.
 - I really should go, mate.

472
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,360
- Come on, babe.

473
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,029
The party hasn't even started.

474
00:19:58,062 --> 00:19:59,798
Have a whiff of this.

475
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:02,766
Oh, fuck.

476
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,036
- How's your night?

477
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:07,906
I met Joey Gibbs.
  - I met a rapist.

478
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,878
Give us a double
  cheese, will you?

479
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:16,548
- Fuck, man, you did
 have a shit night.

480
00:20:16,581 --> 00:20:18,382
- Whatever, man, just make it.

481
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,918
- Moment on the lip,
 lifetime on the hips.

482
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:22,487
- Meh.
 - Meh?

483
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,822
- Meh.

484
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,523
Hey, do you know
 anyone from New York?

485
00:20:25,556 --> 00:20:27,792
- Billy Grabowski.
 - No, he's in Mambo, isn't he?

486
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,127
- Oh, yeah.

487
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,062
Don't know.

488
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:34,866
- Hello.
 - Mark, Gary.

489
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,635
- Yeah, this is Gary,
 sorry, who's this?

490
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,503
- Charlie Overton, I'm
the head of programming

491
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:39,971
for the New York Festival.

492
00:20:40,004 --> 00:20:42,240
I saw your video
  on NBC last night.

493
00:20:42,273 --> 00:20:44,141
- Oh, wow, Charlie,
it's great to meet you.

494
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,144
Hey, Mark.
  - What?

495
00:20:46,177 --> 00:20:49,046
- It's got Charlie
 Overton on the phone.

496
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,814
He's from the New York Festival.

497
00:20:50,848 --> 00:20:52,584
It's on a video call.

498
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:55,053
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

499
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:56,321
- Hi, I'm Mark.

500
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:58,857
Bad reception in here,
so we'll just take it--

501
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,558
- So, I can't hear you,
what are you saying?

502
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:03,727
Oh, just lost picture
 on you there, Charlie.

503
00:21:03,761 --> 00:21:04,763
- [Mark] Sorry about that, mate.

504
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,231
Just fiddling with the modem.

505
00:21:06,264 --> 00:21:10,635
Have you got that, is
  that all plugged in there?

506
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:11,503
- [Both] Hi.

507
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:12,737
- OK.

508
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,172
So, the whole town's
 talking about you.

509
00:21:14,205 --> 00:21:15,674
It's quite the achievement,
 that much cash in that

510
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:17,642
little time.
 - Took us by surprise.

511
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:18,810
- I'll bet.

512
00:21:18,843 --> 00:21:20,145
So, where's it all at?

513
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:22,247
- Well, we're just workshopping
the script, really.

514
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,281
- Got a cast?

515
00:21:23,314 --> 00:21:25,417
- Yeah, pretty much.
 - Who?

516
00:21:27,285 --> 00:21:29,721
- Jack Simpson's probably
 gonna play the lead, actually.

517
00:21:29,754 --> 00:21:31,121
- Great actor.
 - He is.

518
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:33,425
We're still casting
 the romantic lead.

519
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,260
- Well, if it's half as
good as Gilded Lilies,

520
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:36,695
you ought to have a
 hit on your hands.

521
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,563
- What, did you see it?
- Yeah, Mardi Gras 06.

522
00:21:38,596 --> 00:21:40,632
Broke my heart.

523
00:21:40,665 --> 00:21:42,701
- Wow, that's great.
 - So, listen.

524
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:44,168
My opening night
 show's fallen through.

525
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:45,804
Predator the Musical.

526
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:46,671
- Cool.

527
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:47,772
Was Arnie in it?
- No.

528
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:49,174
- Carl Weathers?
- No.

529
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:50,642
- [Both] Neville McBebee?

530
00:21:50,675 --> 00:21:52,143
- How the fuck do
  you know McBebee?

531
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:53,912
That guy was like an
 extra in that film.

532
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,413
- Yeah, but he's only
like one of the greatest

533
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:56,947
character actors ever.
 - Awesome.

534
00:21:56,981 --> 00:21:58,383
- Agreed, he's underrated.

535
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,851
- Do you know him?
  - I met him at his

536
00:21:59,884 --> 00:22:00,685
pizzeria once.

537
00:22:00,718 --> 00:22:01,553
He's a great guy.

538
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,787
Let's cut the crap.

539
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,723
I need a replacement and
from what I've heard,

540
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:06,925
Honey I'm Homeless
 would be a great fit.

541
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,260
- What was that, what
 did you say Charlie?

542
00:22:09,293 --> 00:22:11,262
- What I'm saying is,
if you guys want to open

543
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:13,998
the New York Festival,
 we'd have you.

544
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:17,569
- Oh, yeah, it's just, it's
 not quite finished yet.

545
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:18,703
That's the thing.
- It's OK, I understand

546
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:21,406
the process, so what do you say?

547
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,977
- I don't know what to say.
 - Great, I'll take that

548
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:27,846
as a yes.

549
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,782
OK, lots to do, guys.

550
00:22:30,815 --> 00:22:32,350
Opening night's in six weeks.
 - Six weeks?

551
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:33,918
Sorry, like from today?
- Yeah.

552
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:36,788
And by the way,
  don't let me down.

553
00:22:39,657 --> 00:22:41,726
- Hey, weren't you guys
meant to be writing?

554
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:43,228
- Yeah.
 - We're warming up.

555
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,262
- Take this.

556
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,232
Director's fee.

557
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,267
What?

558
00:22:50,601 --> 00:22:51,436
What?

559
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,539
- You know Charlie Overton.
 - The producer?

560
00:22:54,572 --> 00:22:56,573
- Yeah, he called us last
 night and we kind of agreed

561
00:22:56,607 --> 00:22:58,810
that the musical we
 haven't written should open

562
00:22:58,843 --> 00:23:00,678
the New York Festival.
 - In six weeks.

563
00:23:00,711 --> 00:23:02,180
In New York.

564
00:23:02,213 --> 00:23:03,782
And we kind of implied that
 Jack Simpson was attached.

565
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:05,250
- Which he isn't.

566
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:10,488
- Buy a TV.
 - New Air Jordan's.

567
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:12,023
- Made by Asian toddlers, man.

568
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,825
- Everything we buy is
made by Asian toddlers.

569
00:23:13,858 --> 00:23:15,527
- They're your kids.
  - I'm not having any kids.

570
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,128
- Oh, bullshit, what if
Beck Bernstein asked you

571
00:23:17,161 --> 00:23:18,563
to make babies?
  - Don't talk about

572
00:23:18,596 --> 00:23:19,798
her, please.
  - What, are you gonna cry?

573
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:20,965
- Fuck off, you
  gave Tiff herpes.

574
00:23:20,998 --> 00:23:22,100
- That's true.
 - You gonna tell her

575
00:23:22,133 --> 00:23:23,368
about that?
 - Are you gonna tell

576
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:24,536
Beck Bernstein you love her?
 - Fuck off.

577
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,837
- You're meeting Jack at midday.

578
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,604
- What, where?
 - In his shed.

579
00:23:27,638 --> 00:23:30,108
Now, I'm gonna book a rehearsal
venue, you start tomorrow.

580
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:31,176
- But we don't have
 a script, Shay.

581
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,410
- Figure it out.

582
00:23:32,443 --> 00:23:33,645
- What the fuck are we
 meant to say to him?

583
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:34,546
- I don't know, you're
creatives, be creative.

584
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,347
Get Jack Simpson.

585
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,882
And in the name of
  (foreign language spoken),

586
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:40,085
put some fucking pants on.

587
00:23:41,352 --> 00:23:42,187
- Far out.

588
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:46,525
(guitar music)

589
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:49,661
(throat clearing)

590
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,330
- Good day fellas.
  - Hey, good day.

591
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:53,298
Cool shed.

592
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:54,899
What are you doing?

593
00:23:54,932 --> 00:23:56,768
- Just rebuilding a carbie.

594
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,602
Bike.
- Sweet.

595
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:00,205
- You guys ride?

596
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:01,706
- No.
  - I have.

597
00:24:01,739 --> 00:24:03,074
- When?
  - The 10.

598
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,711
- Hey, take a seat.
 - Thanks, man.

599
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,522
- So, why me?
- For the play?

600
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:18,756
Musical.

601
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:21,658
- Well, you know,
 you're Jack Simpson.

602
00:24:21,692 --> 00:24:22,527
- I am.

603
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:26,231
- So, have you seen our video?
 - Yep.

604
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,265
- Is it something
 that interests you?

605
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,301
- Yep.
 - Why?

606
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,271
- Spent my life being this.
 - What, like an awesome,

607
00:24:33,304 --> 00:24:35,707
buff action dude.
 - Yeah, who's got like

608
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,911
the coolest shed in the world
 and fixes carbies and stuff.

609
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,615
So, like, what does marriage
 equality mean to you?

610
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,551
- Oh, love is a beautiful
  thing, full stop, I guess.

611
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:49,020
- Do you have a babe?

612
00:24:49,053 --> 00:24:50,588
- More importantly, what
does marriage equality

613
00:24:50,621 --> 00:24:52,057
mean to you guys?

614
00:24:54,358 --> 00:24:56,661
- My grandma, she
  was from Egypt.

615
00:24:56,694 --> 00:24:59,163
She came here on a boat,
took her three months.

616
00:24:59,196 --> 00:25:00,365
- Yep.
- You know what

617
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:01,765
her welcome was?

618
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,868
Local milk baron
  spat in her face.

619
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:06,170
- Yep.
- She didn't spit back.

620
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:07,504
She hugged the prick.

621
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,474
- She says I'm
  not gonna let him.

622
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,342
- She always said, &quot;Be who
 you are, say what you feel,

623
00:25:11,375 --> 00:25:13,711
&quot;because those who
  mind don't matter,

624
00:25:13,744 --> 00:25:16,047
&quot;and those who
 matter don't mind.&quot;

625
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,484
- I think you'll find
 that was Dr. Seuss.

626
00:25:22,253 --> 00:25:24,621
- Anyway, there's a
lot of people out there

627
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:27,492
that don't matter, right,
 but they've still got a say.

628
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,726
They're our brothers.
 - And sisters.

629
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,695
Our fathers.
 - Politicians, our policemen.

630
00:25:30,728 --> 00:25:33,298
- Our waiters, our teachers.
 - Our milkshake makers.

631
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,266
Our horse riders.
 - All those people.

632
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,101
We want to change 'em.
- Yeah, we want to crack

633
00:25:38,135 --> 00:25:40,104
their skulls with a show tune.

634
00:25:40,137 --> 00:25:42,407
- Dazzling, dancing,
 all different style.

635
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,409
- A really professional wig.
 - A love story that would

636
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,612
melt the ice queen of Greenland.

637
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:49,681
- No, Iceland, wouldn't it?
 - Greenland's colder.

638
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,514
- No, is it?

639
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,716
I don't think it is.

640
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:52,884
- Well, actually, I saw
Wrecking Man in both

641
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:54,418
countries and
 Greenland is colder.

642
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:56,321
- Fuck, I love Wrecking Man,
 it's like our favorite film.

643
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,722
- So cool.
 - You know that scene?

644
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:00,625
Give me back my daughter
or I will wreck you.

645
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:04,663
- How can you wreck me
  if you can't even see me?

646
00:26:05,963 --> 00:26:07,132
- [Both] Acid.

647
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:09,834
(screaming)

648
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:11,970
- I can't--
 - Karate chop.

649
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:16,307
Have fun in hell, Wrecking Man.

650
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,477
- I'll get you, evil nemesis.
 - Finished?

651
00:26:20,511 --> 00:26:21,913
- Yeah.

652
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:23,715
- But seriously, like,
 straight up, Jack.

653
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,183
You're amazing.

654
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,450
- The show is made for you.

655
00:26:26,484 --> 00:26:28,086
- Plus, we already told
New York you'd be in it.

656
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:29,954
- You what?
 - It was an accident.

657
00:26:29,987 --> 00:26:30,822
Sort of.

658
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:37,361
- So, when do we start?
- Nine AM tomorrow.

659
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:41,032
- I'm in, dudes.

660
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,169
- So, what, do you want
  to start with some games?

661
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:47,905
- No, we can't play
games with Jack Simpson.

662
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:50,174
We've got to talk concept,
  character, motor bikes.

663
00:26:50,207 --> 00:26:51,376
- OK, so what?

664
00:26:52,576 --> 00:26:54,345
It's a couple, they
 want to get married.

665
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:56,313
They can't, they've got
an adopted Chinese kid

666
00:26:56,347 --> 00:26:58,917
called, I don't know, Zen Jwan.

667
00:27:00,184 --> 00:27:01,485
What are their names?

668
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,023
- Jack can be Oscar, the
other guy can be Harvey.

669
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:06,557
- Hey, Shay, who's
  playing Harvey?

670
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,992
- Kip Young.

671
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,528
He just wrapped on
 a huge vampire film.

672
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:12,629
He is about to pop.
 - Can he sing?

673
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:14,032
- Who cares, hot.

674
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,433
- But he's in his mid 20's.

675
00:27:15,466 --> 00:27:16,668
They're supposed to be a couple.

676
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:18,536
- I'm not a fucking
 casting director.

677
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:19,671
Alan, dancer.

678
00:27:21,105 --> 00:27:22,840
- Not every show you do
  is important, but this one

679
00:27:22,873 --> 00:27:24,175
really is.
 - Yeah, it's an issue

680
00:27:24,208 --> 00:27:25,877
that's really close to a
lot of people's hearts,

681
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,845
so we got to treat it with
  the respect it deserves.

682
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:29,580
- But we'll also have a little
 bit of fun along the way.

683
00:27:29,613 --> 00:27:31,015
- Yeah, oh yeah.

684
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,718
So, just a little
  insight into our process,

685
00:27:33,751 --> 00:27:34,753
how we work.

686
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,895
- This is not a dictatorship.
 - Yeah, because when you see

687
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:48,032
Alec Baldwin, you see the
 true ugliness of human nature.

688
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:49,600
(laughing)

689
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:51,803
- Team America.
- Yeah.

690
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,337
Now, look, all ideas are valid.

691
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,040
OK, we want this to be something
we can all be proud of.

692
00:27:56,073 --> 00:27:58,142
- Got you.
  - So, let's start

693
00:27:58,175 --> 00:28:00,011
with a few exercises.
 - Exercises?

694
00:28:00,044 --> 00:28:01,479
- Yeah, exercises.

695
00:28:01,512 --> 00:28:03,848
So, let's start with a real
 simple one, it's called

696
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:06,451
&quot;One thing you do and
 don't know about me.&quot;

697
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,952
Mark will start.

698
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:09,687
You just gotta be open and
  honest, that's the key.

699
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,557
- So, one thing you do know
 about me is I'm a director.

700
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,125
- I thought Greg
  was the director.

701
00:28:14,158 --> 00:28:16,394
- It's Gary, and
 we're both directing.

702
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:17,562
- That's weird.

703
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,131
- One thing you don't
 know about me is

704
00:28:20,164 --> 00:28:21,833
I never knew my family.

705
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,735
My grandma raised me.

706
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,370
- OK, I'll jump in.

707
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,639
Good day, my name is Jack.

708
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,641
Guess you all know that.

709
00:28:30,674 --> 00:28:32,844
One thing you do know about
 me is that I built my own

710
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,044
pop up bungle.

711
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:39,117
And OK, something you
 don't know about me.

712
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,487
Well, I recently lost
my best mate to cancer.

713
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,354
Fuck.

714
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,560
I just really miss
  his little meow.

715
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:51,763
- That's really sad, Jack.

716
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,399
I don't know what I'd do
without my little pug.

717
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,268
Dennis.

718
00:28:58,669 --> 00:29:02,206

He shot himself in

doing a play about them?

- Jesus, Harvey.

840
00:35:23,353 --> 00:35:24,855

Baby, get in my oven and
season it with spunk.

851
00:36:17,975 --> 00:36:20,778
- This is fucking
  bullshit, mate.

852
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,781
- They're just, they're a
highly sexualized couple, Jack.

853
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:26,283
- This is like a 12 year old's
 view of like gay intimacy.

854
00:36:26,316 --> 00:36:27,685
These two blokes are having
 a blow, and what, they

00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,754
start fucking finger
 fucking each other?

856
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:32,223
Have I missed the point?

857

you can say outrageous
 things, you can say anything.

859
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,296
- Oh, really, say
outrageous things like,

860
00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:41,398
&quot;Park your submarine
 in my dry dock and

861
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:42,633

862
00:36:42,666 --> 00:36:44,401
- That one is meant to be funny.

863
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:45,869
- It's not funny.

864
00:36:45,902 --> 00:36:46,737
Fix it.

- Get in my oven.

868
00:36:56,413 --> 00:36:57,982
Was trying to fix it.

869
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,151
This is not what husbands
  do, we're not husbands.

870
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:02,953
I think the beget stuff
might be a bit much.

871
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:03,854
- No, it's funny.

872
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,356
- To a prepubescent.

873
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,291
Could we have a flat white
  and a cappuccino please?

874
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:08,525
- Comrades.

875
00:37:08,558 --> 00:37:12,396
Shay tells me you guys
are kicking major goals.

876
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,368
That's cool.

877
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,969
- Yeah, no, it's
 going really great.

878
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,004
How are you, mate?

879
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,205
- A little CD with the ST.

880
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,942
- Sorry?
- Huh?

881
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:26,110
- What?
- What?

882
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:28,012
- What did you say?
 - Sorry, man.

883
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:30,581
Little current development
  with the state theater.

884
00:37:30,614 --> 00:37:32,316
- All right, cool.
  - No, man.

885
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:33,550
Too many hoops.

886
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:34,518
I've got bad knees,
 you know what I mean?

887
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:35,753
I'm stuck.

888
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:37,221
- Yeah, well, you know,
you just got to juice

889
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:38,689
when the fruit's
  ready for juicing.

890
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:39,923
- I love that.

891
00:37:39,956 --> 00:37:41,191
No one wants to
  eat a hard banana.

892
00:37:41,224 --> 00:37:42,993
- Well, some do.

893
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,095
- Coffee's up.
 - Cheers.

894
00:37:45,128 --> 00:37:46,563
- Guys, I envy you.

895
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:48,532
You march on the beat
 of your own drum.

896
00:37:48,565 --> 00:37:50,835
(drumming)

897
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:58,142
- Thanks.
  - Thanks.

898
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,343
- See you later.
 - No, man, seriously.

899
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,078
You guys, you don't get it yet.

900
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:02,645
You don't.

901
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:04,615
The envy, it's green.

902
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,017
It's like the Emerald City.

903
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,386
Minus the flying
 monkeys, obviously.

904
00:38:09,419 --> 00:38:13,022
Gilded Lilies reached
 into my heart.

905
00:38:13,056 --> 00:38:16,293
You broke it, you mended
it, in 92 minutes.

906
00:38:16,326 --> 00:38:18,929
Of delicious storytelling.

907
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:21,498
If it wasn't for you guys,

908
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:25,369
I'd still be pushing
pencils in a legal firm.

909
00:38:25,402 --> 00:38:26,837
You believe that?

910
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:29,674
You believe it?

911
00:38:30,607 --> 00:38:33,009
- I can, I mean, yeah, I can.

912
00:38:38,315 --> 00:38:40,417
(foreign language spoken)

913
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,452
Thanks, man.

914
00:38:45,055 --> 00:38:45,890
- Ah, man.

915
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:47,925
- Weird, right?

916
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:49,660
- The guy we thought was
basically the biggest

917
00:38:49,693 --> 00:38:51,395
cheese dick in the
 entire universe just

918
00:38:51,428 --> 00:38:53,596
professed his love for us.
  - Weird.

919
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,499
- What's all that about?
- It's kind of cool,

920
00:38:55,532 --> 00:38:56,734
when you think about it, though.

921
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:58,234
- Mm.

922
00:38:58,268 --> 00:38:59,636
He pushes the boundaries.
  - He's got a sweet hat.

923
00:38:59,669 --> 00:39:01,004
- Speaks Arabic.

924
00:39:01,037 --> 00:39:02,939
- Maybe we are on
  the right track.

925
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:05,976
- Gentlemen, we're
  on in three, two.

926
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:10,814
Welcome back to KSL853.

927
00:39:10,847 --> 00:39:13,117
You are with the Kim
  Divine Show, listening to

928
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:17,721
Kim Divine talking to Mark
  Zeegrab and Gary Eastwood,

929
00:39:17,754 --> 00:39:19,823
creators of the new
  musical set to open at the

930
00:39:19,856 --> 00:39:22,326
New York Festival next month.

931
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,627
Honey I'm Homeless.

932
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,362
Gentlemen, welcome and
 I'm quoting from your

933
00:39:25,395 --> 00:39:28,699
press release here, a
 politically charged,

934
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:31,335
entertaining romp that
 charts the struggles

935
00:39:31,368 --> 00:39:35,806
of a homosexual couple
desperate to be married.

936
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,808
Entertaining romp.
 - Yeah, it's full of

937
00:39:37,841 --> 00:39:40,043
great songs and dance numbers.

938
00:39:40,076 --> 00:39:41,812
- To raise your money,
 you're using what's becoming

939
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:44,180
quite a popular
 tool, crowd funding.

940
00:39:44,214 --> 00:39:45,382
Why that route?

941
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:46,917
- Well, it empowers
 the individual.

942
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,551
These people are--
 - These people Mark is

943
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,588
referring to, they're the
  gays, they're the lesbians

944
00:39:51,621 --> 00:39:54,458
that are wishing to
  redefine one of society's

945
00:39:54,491 --> 00:39:56,727
strongest traditions.
 - I don't think we can

946
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,195
say that marriage
  is traditional.

947
00:39:58,228 --> 00:39:59,630
It's been evolving forever.

948
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:02,132
- If it hadn't interracial
  couples wouldn't be

949
00:40:02,165 --> 00:40:03,567
allowed to wed.

950
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,102
You know, you'd have
  parents selling their kids

951
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:06,670
to the highest bidders and
  princes would be marrying

952
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,205
six year olds, so I think it's--

953
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:11,707
- Oh, hear the chimes of
 the default leftist stance.

954
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:14,812
Why wouldn't you get your
  money from a real source?

955
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,346
I don't know, a producer.

956
00:40:16,379 --> 00:40:18,949
- Well, look, with that
comes a lot of red tape

957
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:20,350
and restrictions--
  - So, ultimately,

958
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:23,620
no legitimate organization
  would touch it.

959
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:25,923
With minority issues like
  this, isn't it better

960
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,792
for our politicians in
parliament to be debating this,

961
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:32,997
rather than literally making
 a song and dance about it?

962
00:40:34,164 --> 00:40:36,033
- Well, firstly, it's
hardly a minority issue.

963
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:38,202
- Many of my listeners
 would beg to differ.

964
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,871
- I bet they would.
 - No one has the right

965
00:40:40,904 --> 00:40:42,206
to redefine marriage.
 - Tell that

966
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,774
to Henry the Eighth.
 - Gary.

967
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:45,241
Are you gay?
 - No.

968
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:48,412
- Mark, you?
 - No.

969
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,847
- So, I've got to ask.

970
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:53,951
What makes you the flag
bearers for the tyrannized gays

971
00:40:53,984 --> 00:40:55,285
of the world?
  - We've got a lot

972
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:56,753
of gay friends.

973
00:40:56,786 --> 00:40:59,957
I played a gay man in a show.
 - You played a gay man.

974
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,194
Gary, I see here on your
CV that you played an

975
00:41:04,227 --> 00:41:06,964
ambulance officer on a soap.

976
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,565
Tell me.

977
00:41:08,598 --> 00:41:12,569
If I was in a car
 crash tomorrow, could
 you save my life?

978
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:14,136
- I have done my first
 aid certificate, so--

979
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,240
- I think the point is,
 you're not a registered ambo.

980
00:41:16,273 --> 00:41:18,242
You were playing a part, yes?

981
00:41:18,275 --> 00:41:20,043
It was a fantasy.

982
00:41:20,076 --> 00:41:21,512
I ask you again.

983
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:24,281
What makes you
  two the authority?

984
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:28,952
See, here's the thing, boys.

985
00:41:28,985 --> 00:41:32,956
I grew up with the Sound
 of Music, the Wizard of Oz.

986
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:33,991
That's entertainment.

987
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,392
Honey, I'm Homeless.

988
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,761
I'm sorry, but this
sounds like two lefties

989
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:41,163
cashing in on a hot
 political issue.

990
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:42,432
You want to know what I think?

991
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:45,302
Let them commit, let
them even live together.

992
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,904
But marriage is sacred.

993
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:50,274
Man and woman, full stop,
  no argument from me.

994
00:41:50,307 --> 00:41:52,709
After the break, it's
 traffic with Vince Larocki.

995
00:41:52,742 --> 00:41:53,577
We're out.

996
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,319
- That guy was a fucking cock.
 - It's bullshit.

997
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:03,420
He's a philistine.

998
00:42:03,453 --> 00:42:04,588
- Well, you guys
handled it well.

999
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:05,956
You're never gonna
change people like that.

1000
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:07,224
- Isn't that the whole point?
 - I suffer all kinds

1001
00:42:07,257 --> 00:42:08,725
of shit because I'm black.
  - And gay.

1002
00:42:08,758 --> 00:42:10,327
- Yeah.

1003
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,795
But I don't care.

1004
00:42:11,828 --> 00:42:13,030
It's the people on the
  fence who need to change.

1005
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,464
That's who you need to get.

1006
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:17,301
Eventually, openness
  will outnumber prejudice.

1007
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,935
That's why you do the show.

1008
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,037
- Oh, Buddha.

1009
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,907
PS, media launch next week.

1010
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:25,842
- Hopefully we can teach
Kip to sing by then.

1011
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:27,811
- Yeah, thanks for that
amazing piece of casting, Shay.

1012
00:42:27,844 --> 00:42:29,580
- Why don't you get
 him to speak it?

1013
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:30,948
Works for Leonard Cohen.

1014
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:32,516
- Kip Cohen, yeah, cool.

1015
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:33,951
- How's the show?

1016
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:36,753
Is it ready?
  - There's a couple of song

1017
00:42:36,786 --> 00:42:40,057
writing issues, but
 we'll be all right.

1018
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,561

Fucking doing it, man.

1086
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:46,977
We're having a fucking
 Broadway musical.

1098
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,404

1099
00:46:14,437 --> 00:46:15,939

1101
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:21,311
Here you go, guys.

1102
00:46:22,478 --> 00:46:24,347
- Jesus.
  - Actually butchered these

1103
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,883
myself at my farm.
  - Oh, cool.

1104
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,186
Do you hunt a lot?
  - Yeah, fair bit.

1105
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:31,788
- How many guns you got?
- Just the one.

1106
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:33,356
- How do you hunt a quail?

1107
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:35,258
- Use a trap, mate.
  - You ever killed a lion?

1108
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:36,860
- So, where's your farm?

1109
00:46:36,893 --> 00:46:38,729
- 100 miles northwest.

1110
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:41,932
- Get there a lot?
  - Nah, not as much

1111
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,600
as I used to.

1112
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:46,035
Did you ever see a fucking
  lion in the bush, dude?

1113
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,504
(laughing)

1114
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:49,606
- Well, I wouldn't know,
 I've never been to the bush.

1115
00:46:49,639 --> 00:46:51,909
(laughing)

1116
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:56,613
- Hey, who's that?
- That handsome bastard

1117
00:46:56,646 --> 00:46:58,148
up there is Billy.

1118
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,922
Actually, Billy and I
 bought this place together.

1119
00:47:05,955 --> 00:47:07,424
Yeah.

1120
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:11,361
Bought the farm together,
  too, but he passed away.

1121
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:15,365
Listen, boys.

1122
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:21,772
I've been doing this
 shit all my life.

1123
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,740
Billy was my,

1124
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:30,080
and I kept it hidden, for what?

1125
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:31,281
For my career.

1126
00:47:32,882 --> 00:47:34,217
Pretty shameful, huh?

1127
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,987
So, when I saw
  your little video,

1128
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:40,123
I decided that I had to do it.

1129
00:47:40,156 --> 00:47:43,660
I guess it's the closest
I'll ever come to

1130
00:47:45,561 --> 00:47:46,830
well, you know.

1131
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:52,369
- Did Billy like hunting?

1132
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:55,939
- He fucking loved it, mate.

1133
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:58,242
(laughing)

1134
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,356
- Full on, man.
- Big time.

1135
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,025
- I had goosebumps.
 - I nearly cried.

1136
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,092
- Really?

1137
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,527
Me, too.

1138
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:18,795
- Wrecking Man's gay.

1139
00:48:18,828 --> 00:48:20,497
- Still a total badass, though.

1140
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:21,431
- Uber bad.

1141
00:48:23,299 --> 00:48:25,201
Hey, we should write
 a song about that.

1142
00:48:25,234 --> 00:48:27,069
- What, about Jack and Billy?

1143
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:30,106
That would be sweet, we
 could call it Billy's Song.

00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:51,194
Alone in the ring.

1150
00:48:51,227 --> 00:48:52,662
Doubt.

1151
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:55,332
I didn't have you watch Rocky
 as a kid because you loved

1152
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:56,799
the fights.

1153
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,836
Rocky made the most
 of every opportunity.

1154
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:03,006
You couldn't have a
 better role model.

1155
00:49:04,307 --> 00:49:08,312
Unless someone like you
cares a whole awful lot,

1156
00:49:09,312 --> 00:49:11,647
nothing is gonna get better.

1157
00:49:13,016 --> 00:49:13,850
It's not.

1158
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:24,327

 wrote you a new song.

- Thanks, mate.

00:51:03,025 --> 00:51:05,361
and watered my cactus
 instead of coming out

1188
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:07,096

I may enjoy an Oscar
  Wilde quote, but at least

1196
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,581
I'm not fishing for votes.

1197
00:51:24,614 --> 00:51:27,283
How could you sit on
 this for four weeks?

1198
00:51:27,316 --> 00:51:28,417
- I was trying to fix it.

1199
00:51:28,451 --> 00:51:29,752

- Victor Fringe, I
fucked the camera, cut.

 - You've got some

action man guns.
- Yeah, right.

1275
00:56:47,069 --> 00:56:50,072

00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,326
- Suck a dick.

1286
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:12,795
Just finished a workshop
with Fairfax Ward.

1287
00:57:12,828 --> 00:57:14,297
- Who?
- Oh, you know.

1288
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:16,165
The hottest director ever.
  - Oh, that's debatable.

1289
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:17,033
- Patrol.

1290
00:57:17,933 --> 00:57:20,136

I will wreck you.

1294
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:30,613
- Dude, your fly's undone.
  - Easy access.

1295
00:57:34,783 --> 00:57:38,254

 anyone want anything?

1297
00:57:43,025 --> 00:57:46,162
- So, rehearsals with
 Fairfax are amazing.

1298
00:57:46,195 --> 00:57:47,763
- I bet.
- Take me out to dinner

1299
00:57:47,796 --> 00:57:51,301
tomorrow night.
 - Is the Chad gonna tag on?

1300
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:58,307
Whatever gets you ahead, babe.
 - I fucking hate you.

1301
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,676
- Just feel like a
 fucking phony, man.

1302
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:01,977
I can't sing.

1303
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,647
My fucking fringe is insured.

1304
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:07,450
I just want to
  work in a Hobbyco.

1305
00:58:09,184 --> 00:58:11,087

1306
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,121
There we go.

1307
00:58:13,188 --> 00:58:15,091

 - Hey.

Jack.

1309
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:18,828
- Still burning?
  - Yeah, mate, OK.

1310
00:58:19,762 --> 00:58:22,398
I'll just grab you a water.

1311
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:23,833
- What's happening?

1312
00:58:23,866 --> 00:58:24,967
- Oh, Shay, sup?

1313
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,335
Come meet us, man.

1314
00:58:26,368 --> 00:58:27,670
We're at Life Car.

1315
00:58:27,703 --> 00:58:29,805

00:58:56,865 --> 00:58:58,167
- You suck.
 - Give me a minute.

1319
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:00,035
I'll get it up, I promise.

1320

- So, when is he gonna wake up?

1351
01:00:46,008 --> 01:00:48,678
- When his brain stops swelling.

1352
01:00:50,979 --> 01:00:53,281
He was buying tickets
 for our anniversary.

1353
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:55,284

caught up and he shook my hand,

1358
01:01:04,626 --> 01:01:07,430

  - Shay.

1359
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,533
You know we leave
 in two days, right?

1360
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,537

 he will, man.

1372
01:01:55,377 --> 01:01:57,580

I don't know, like, what
do you want me to say?

1374

Oh.

1375
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:06,989
Well, yeah, by the way,
 our show sucks, apparently.

1376
01:02:07,022 --> 01:02:09,491
Yep, it's like, what's this,
 an episode of South Park

1377
01:02:09,525 --> 01:02:10,960

  is a good tweet, this one.

1381
01:02:15,697 --> 01:02:19,435
Worst casting of the
 decade, pairing a tween idol

1382
01:02:19,468 --> 01:02:22,238
and aging action star
as star crossed lovers.

1383
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:23,206

1384
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,209
Fuck.
  - What are you doing, man?

1385
01:02:27,242 --> 01:02:28,744
- Man, no one else is out
 there trying to do anything

1386
01:02:28,777 --> 01:02:30,646
about marriage equality.
- Yeah, well, maybe

1387
01:02:30,679 --> 01:02:31,547
they're right.

1388
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,249
- Well, they're not.

1389
01:02:36,852 --> 01:02:39,788
- Oh, no fucking way.
 - Tweet that shit to the man.

1390
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:42,124
Aging action star and
 tween idol dry fuck

1391
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:44,927
in an alley, hashtag
 marriage equality.

1392
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:47,730
- All right, tween
  idol, action star,

1393
01:02:47,763 --> 01:02:49,531
dry fuck in alley, attach image.

1394
01:02:49,565 --> 01:02:50,766
- Don't.
- I'm not actually gonna

1395
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:52,001
do it, dick, I'm
 just having a joke.

1396
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:53,435
- It's not funny.
  - Fuck off.

1397
01:02:53,468 --> 01:02:54,970
- Neither are you,
  according to the reviews.

1398
01:02:55,003 --> 01:02:56,972
- I didn't read the tweet
 that said Gary isn't funny,

1399
01:02:57,005 --> 01:02:58,207
but Mark's hilarious.

1400
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,274
Do you want to read that
one to me, dickface?

1401
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:00,276
- You're a fucking dickhead.

1402
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:01,243
- You're soft.
 - No, I'm not.

1403
01:03:01,276 --> 01:03:02,578
- You are, call Beck Bernstein.

1404
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:03,645
- Tell Tiff you gave her warts.

1405
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,780
- No.
  - You're a fucking

1406
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:05,981
loser, dude.
 - Yeah, well, you're

1407
01:03:06,014 --> 01:03:08,083
a fucking grandma dick
 faced shit fucker.

1408
01:03:08,116 --> 01:03:09,585
- Yeah, well, at least
 I got a fucking family

1409
01:03:09,618 --> 01:03:10,653
that like me.

1410
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:12,421
(grunting)

1411
01:03:12,454 --> 01:03:14,891
Fuck, Gary, you fucking cock.

1412
01:03:17,659 --> 01:03:19,895
- What?
 - How do you delete a Tweet?

1413
01:03:19,928 --> 01:03:20,830
- Oh, fuck.

1414
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,205
- Did you do it?
  - Yeah, it's fine.

1415
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,071
- Fuck.

1416
01:03:31,106 --> 01:03:33,342
(laughing)

1417
01:03:34,943 --> 01:03:35,778
- Far out.

1418
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,614
Hey, look, I'm

1419
01:03:41,383 --> 01:03:42,216
sorry.

1420
01:03:43,685 --> 01:03:45,387
You're too soft to
call Beth Bernstein and

1421
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:49,725
you fuck your grandma.
 - I'm sorry you spread warts.

1422
01:03:49,758 --> 01:03:51,828
And your family hates ya.

1423
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:57,800
Fuck man, I hope Carl's OK.

1424
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,837
- Me, too, man, me, too.

1425
01:04:08,210 --> 01:04:09,712
- Hey.
 - Hey, Jack.

1426
01:04:11,513 --> 01:04:13,348
- Fucking assholes.

1427
01:04:13,382 --> 01:04:15,117
How could you?

1428
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:17,386
One point one million followers.

1429
01:04:17,419 --> 01:04:18,953
- Fuck, the tweet.

1430
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:20,890
No, no, no, we deleted it, Jack.

1431
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,991
- Too late, dickhead.
 - It was an accident.

1432
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,293
- I'm so sorry.

1433
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:31,033
- We're done.

1434
01:04:32,868 --> 01:04:33,769
- Kip's out.

1435
01:04:33,802 --> 01:04:35,304
Suck Two has been optioned.

1436
01:04:35,337 --> 01:04:36,572
- Oh, whatever.

1437
01:04:37,806 --> 01:04:39,275
- I'm leaving the show.

1438
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:41,377
You hurt Jack's feelings.

1439
01:04:53,488 --> 01:04:54,656
- Two for one.

1440
01:04:58,293 --> 01:04:59,996
- [Gary] Thanks, Deb.

1441
01:05:01,930 --> 01:05:03,198
- There's not enough pepperoni.

1442
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,035
- Yeah, or cheese.
  - Try this one.

1443
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,436
- No, I don't like chicken.

1444
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:10,005
- Too much chili.
  - Guys, these are gourmet.

1445
01:05:10,038 --> 01:05:11,674
- Well, it all turns to shit.

1446
01:05:11,707 --> 01:05:14,810
- OK, correct me if I'm
wrong, but I am sensing

1447
01:05:14,843 --> 01:05:17,446
some bad vibes.
- What, no.

1448
01:05:17,479 --> 01:05:19,147
I'm just not hungry.
 - No, it's not about

1449
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:21,116
you hunger, it's
  about your energy.

1450
01:05:21,149 --> 01:05:22,518
- What?

1451
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:24,520
- Just listening.
 - I'm not in the mood, Deb.

1452
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,821
- What's happened with the show?

1453
01:05:26,855 --> 01:05:28,624
I'm sensing a disturbance.

1454
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,392
- Jack left the show today.

1455
01:05:30,425 --> 01:05:31,694
- Something else.

1456
01:05:31,727 --> 01:05:33,328
Very bad vibes.

1457
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,764
A friend.
 - Carl's in hospital.

1458
01:05:35,797 --> 01:05:37,433
- He'll be OK.

1459
01:05:37,466 --> 01:05:39,668
Something deeper.

1460
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,536
Darker.

1461
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,404
Doubt.

1462
01:05:45,607 --> 01:05:47,609
- We had an opportunity
and we screwed it.

1463
01:05:47,642 --> 01:05:51,180
- Been in free fall ever
since the Gilded Lilies.

1464
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:52,681
- I quote.

1465
01:05:52,714 --> 01:05:54,750
A tender, honest love
story the likes of which

1466
01:05:54,783 --> 01:05:56,051
no one has ever seen.

1467
01:05:56,084 --> 01:05:58,620
I defy anyone with a
 pulse not to relate.

1468
01:05:58,653 --> 01:06:00,122
Five stars, the Herald.

1469
01:06:00,155 --> 01:06:01,690
Tenth of a fifth, 2006.

1470
01:06:01,723 --> 01:06:04,894
- It was a fluke.
 - It was our Top Gun.

1471
01:06:06,795 --> 01:06:09,498
See, we never meant for
Gilded Lilies to be gay.

1472
01:06:09,531 --> 01:06:13,067
The first draft, it was
about these two guys

1473
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:15,070
from the bush who were
 gonna come to the city

1474
01:06:15,103 --> 01:06:16,739
for a crack at
 professional footie.

1475
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:18,474
- Late in rehearsal, some
  hotshot producer came in

1476
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:21,110
and watched a run and he
 said it was one of the most

1477
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:23,612
beautiful gay love
stories he'd ever seen,

1478
01:06:23,645 --> 01:06:26,148
but he wanted to know why
  the two guys didn't kiss.

1479
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:28,283
- Yeah, yeah, we made some
  shit up about how, like,

1480
01:06:28,316 --> 01:06:31,153
it would be more understated
 this way, it's more honest.

1481
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:34,056
- But he was like adamant
  that the audience deserved

1482
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:35,691
a kiss.
 - So, we put one in.

1483
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:38,761
- And we'd written the seminal
 gay play of our generation.

1484
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:41,296
- So?
 - So, we're phonies.

1485
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:42,965
- To yourselves, maybe,
but not to the thousands

1486
01:06:42,998 --> 01:06:45,367
that flocked to see it.

1487
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,803
Not to beefcakes that
  were crying on my shoulder

1488
01:06:47,836 --> 01:06:50,906
when Shane and Wane
 finally passed.

1489
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:52,408
- Yeah, well, if they
 read the first draft,

1490
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,109
the would have seen
 that Shane and Wane

1491
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:55,577
raped a chick on their
 first night in Sydney.

1492
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,445
- Oh.

1493
01:06:57,412 --> 01:06:59,481
Well, they didn't.

1494
01:06:59,514 --> 01:07:01,150
Do you know why
  that story worked?

1495
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,719
Because it came from the heart.

1496
01:07:03,752 --> 01:07:04,587
OK.

1497
01:07:07,722 --> 01:07:09,625
You guys are in a cryosleep.

1498
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,261
You need to wake
 up, eat a space bar,

1499
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,395
urinate, put your
 space suit on, type in

1500
01:07:14,429 --> 01:07:16,632
your coordinates,
  and trust your AI

1501
01:07:16,665 --> 01:07:19,235
to get you to your destination.

1502
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,605
So, by AI I mean heart,
and by destination,

1503
01:07:23,638 --> 01:07:25,040
I mean script.

1504
01:07:25,073 --> 01:07:27,009
You know how to fly.

1505
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:28,110
I've seen it.

1506
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,779
Oh, midnight cosplay.

1507
01:07:31,813 --> 01:07:32,882
Ninja vanish.

1508

1509
01:08:12,053 --> 01:08:14,223

- What the fuck is this?

1529
01:09:50,151 --> 01:09:51,720
The show you were
  supposed to write,

1530
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:53,455
the show I programmed,
 is not the show

1531
01:09:53,488 --> 01:09:54,957
that you've written.

1532
01:09:54,990 --> 01:09:56,791
You've cast yourselves as
 the lead, you got bad press.

1533
01:09:56,825 --> 01:09:58,961
People are asking
 for their money back.

1534
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,495
And at what point were
  you planning on telling me

1535
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:03,565
you lost Jack fucking Simpson?

1536
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:05,634
- Just, it didn't work out, man.

1537
01:10:05,667 --> 01:10:06,802
- That's an understatement.

1538
01:10:06,835 --> 01:10:08,303
- We think this
 one's really special.

1539
01:10:08,336 --> 01:10:09,805
- Billy and Me?
- Yeah, yeah.

1540
01:10:09,838 --> 01:10:11,039
Did you read it?

1541
01:10:11,072 --> 01:10:12,007
- Despite the fact I
 want to punch you both

1542
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,909
in the balls, it's not half bad.

1543
01:10:13,942 --> 01:10:15,577
- It uses the same set--
- Costume design.

1544
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:17,913
- I will not program a show
 with two unknown actors

1545
01:10:17,946 --> 01:10:20,148
from Australia without a star.

1546
01:10:20,181 --> 01:10:22,317
If you don't find me a
star by six PM tonight,

1547
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:23,852
I'm pulling the fucking thing.

1548
01:10:23,885 --> 01:10:26,388
And if I pull the fucking
  show, you're picking up

1549
01:10:26,421 --> 01:10:28,357
the fucking check.
  - OK.

1550
01:10:30,825 --> 01:10:32,027
- [Man] Get your star maps here.

1551
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:33,829
Lifestyles of the
  rich and famous.

1552
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,030
Star maps.

1553
01:10:35,063 --> 01:10:38,300
- Dude, star maps, like
celebrity addresses.

1554
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:40,335
- Give me your phone,
  give me your phone, quick.

1555
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:42,604
- Hey, Google that shit.

1556
01:10:42,637 --> 01:10:46,174
Like New York celebrity
something, addresses.

1557
01:10:46,207 --> 01:10:48,143
Is there like a--
  - Ricky Gervais,

1558
01:10:48,176 --> 01:10:51,280
Neil Patrick Harris, Donald
 Trump, all within one mile.

1559
01:10:51,313 --> 01:10:53,482
- Wait, but Donald
Trump, dude, he's like a

1560
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:55,050
billionaire businessman guy.

1561
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,485
- No, I get a really
 good vibe from him.

1562
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:57,786
- He's not doing our
play, he's not an actor.

1563
01:10:57,819 --> 01:10:59,054
- Neither is anyone
 else, at the moment,

1564
01:10:59,087 --> 01:11:01,323
so let's just keep
 our options open, OK?

1565
01:11:01,356 --> 01:11:02,190
- OK.

1566
01:11:02,223 --> 01:11:04,727
(beat boxing)

1567
01:11:06,294 --> 01:11:08,530
- Mr. Gervais, thanks
so much for meeting us.

1568
01:11:08,563 --> 01:11:10,932
We've got this great play,
  you'd be excellent in it.

1569
01:11:10,965 --> 01:11:12,401
It's a small commitment,
you literally open

1570
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:13,802
and close the show.

1571
01:11:13,835 --> 01:11:17,773
It's five nights,
  $50,000, what do you say?

1572
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,840
- Are you having a laugh?
  - Fuck, dude,

1573
01:11:19,874 --> 01:11:21,143
he's not actually
  gonna say that.

1574
01:11:21,176 --> 01:11:22,544
- He might.
  - Well, he's not going to.

1575
01:11:22,577 --> 01:11:23,412
- Mm.

1576
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,148
- Thanks, Gary,
 that's really helpful.

1577
01:11:27,182 --> 01:11:28,150
- Well, I'm just
saying he might.

1578
01:11:28,183 --> 01:11:29,351
- Well, he's not
going to, is he?

1579
01:11:29,384 --> 01:11:30,485
- Every possible
 scenario, isn't it?

1580
01:11:30,518 --> 01:11:32,120
Hey, just after Ricky Gervais.

1581
01:11:32,153 --> 01:11:34,456
(laughing)
  - OK.

1582
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:36,023
♪ Start spreading the news

1583
01:11:36,057 --> 01:11:38,727
♪ We're here today

1584
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,462
- Hi, Pauly Shore there, please.

1585
01:11:40,495 --> 01:11:41,630
- Not here.
 - OK.

1586
01:11:41,663 --> 01:11:42,998
(beat boxing)

1587
01:11:43,031 --> 01:11:45,500
- Hi, my name's Mark, I
was hoping Keanu Reeves

1588
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:47,069
was there please?
 - Yeah, who the fuck is this?

1589
01:11:47,102 --> 01:11:48,269
- Oh, we've written
 him a script.

1590
01:11:48,303 --> 01:11:50,539
- Why, what for?
- We're from Australia.

1591
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,140
Sorry, this is Gary, hi, yeah.

1592
01:11:52,173 --> 01:11:53,675
Yes, Keanu, from the Matrix.

1593
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:54,843
- [Man] I don't know
 who the fuck you are,

1594
01:11:54,876 --> 01:11:56,111
but you ain't seeing Keanu.

1595
01:11:56,144 --> 01:11:57,379
- You don't have to be
 aggressive about it.

1596
01:11:57,412 --> 01:11:59,047
- [Man] Yeah, well, I
do, it's fucking Keanu.

1597
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:01,583
- Yeah, angry American.
- I'm from America.

1598
01:12:01,616 --> 01:12:04,019
Mr. Sandman bring me a dream.

1599
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,092
- Oh, yeah, just after Denzel.
 - Denzel who?

1600
01:12:10,125 --> 01:12:11,026
- Washington.

1601
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:12,661
Hey, just after Alec Baldwin.

1602
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:14,496
- Hi, we're after Ian Ziering.

1603
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:16,231
Hi, is Mr. T there please?
  - Why don't you

1604
01:12:16,264 --> 01:12:18,166
fuck off, sucker?
  - OK.

1605
01:12:18,199 --> 01:12:20,702
(beat boxing)

1606
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:22,904
- No, we've come this far, man.

1607
01:12:22,937 --> 01:12:24,506
- No, fuck it, man.

1608
01:12:24,539 --> 01:12:26,875
Fuck New York, fuck our
 play, fuck marriage equality,

1609
01:12:26,908 --> 01:12:28,377
fuck Rocky.

1610
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,379
I just want to eat take
  out, move to the suburbs,

1611
01:12:30,412 --> 01:12:31,780
get fat.

1612
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:34,816
I'm gonna get so
  fucking fat, man.

1613
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:36,752
Gonna buy some track suit pants.

1614
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:38,653
Gonna work in a call
 center, watch porn

1615
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:40,922
while my bogard
 wife sucks my dick.

1616
01:12:40,955 --> 01:12:42,624
I don't give a fuck.

1617
01:12:44,559 --> 01:12:45,994
It's fucked, man.

1618
01:12:48,897 --> 01:12:49,965
- [Man] Lily.

1619
01:12:53,368 --> 01:12:54,203
- Hi.

1620
01:12:55,136 --> 01:12:56,638
We're Mark and Gary.

1621
01:12:56,671 --> 01:12:59,040
In 2007, someone in your
  office took out an option

1622
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:00,942
on the screen
adaptation of the play,

1623
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:02,411
the Gilded Lilies.
 - Yeah, now we're over here,

1624
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:04,613
we're opening the New York
  Festival with arguably

1625
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:06,882
the most important play ever.

1626
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:08,784
- Now, there's still
 one role to be cast,

1627
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:12,821
the age range is 18
 to 85, ethnicity all.

1628
01:13:12,854 --> 01:13:15,624
$50,000 for five days work.

1629
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:16,825
You do the math.

1630
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:19,961
- Yeah, we got like
 46 minutes, so.

1631
01:13:19,994 --> 01:13:21,263
Shall we dance?

1632
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,103
(jazzy music)

1633
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:05,907
- Well, cheers.

1634
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,746
- Here's to failure.

1635
01:14:13,915 --> 01:14:15,584
- [Man] Have some chili, I
  want a little chili there.

1636
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:16,651
- No.

1637
01:14:16,684 --> 01:14:17,919
- [Man] I want just a handful.

1638
01:14:17,952 --> 01:14:19,421
- We're trying to toast, mate.

1639
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:21,121
- [Man] I thought you were
  supposed to be friendly.

1640
01:14:21,155 --> 01:14:23,657
- Fuck.
  - Thanks, thanks.

1641
01:14:23,691 --> 01:14:25,360
(phone ringing)

1642
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:27,563
Oh, yeah, this is McBebee.

1643
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:32,034
Where?

1644
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:34,169
Are you nuts or what?

1645
01:14:34,202 --> 01:14:35,370
You know what?

1646
01:14:35,403 --> 01:14:37,005
Do me a favor, send
 it to my agent.

1647
01:14:37,038 --> 01:14:38,205
I mean, that's great.

1648
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,175
Send it to my agent, all right?

1649
01:14:41,209 --> 01:14:42,611
I said send it to my agent.

1650
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:45,247
Don't you speak
 English, you moron?

1651
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:46,114
OK, bye.

1652
01:14:47,582 --> 01:14:49,818
- Sorry, are you
Neville McBebee?

1653
01:14:49,851 --> 01:14:50,986
- Yeah, that's me.

1654
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:53,321
(laughing)

1655
01:14:53,354 --> 01:14:54,690
What's so funny?

1656
01:14:56,558 --> 01:14:58,260
Is there something
 wrong with you guys?

1657
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,529
- I'm Mark.
  - Yeah, I'm Gary.

1658
01:15:00,562 --> 01:15:01,963
- I'm McBebee, but
  I don't get it.

1659
01:15:01,996 --> 01:15:04,199
- We're probably like
 your biggest fans.

1660
01:15:04,232 --> 01:15:06,167
- Yeah, we've seen like
everything you've done.

1661
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:09,037
- Your work in Who's the
Boss, that was amazing.

1662
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:10,505
It made me cry.
 - You want to know something?

1663
01:15:10,538 --> 01:15:14,276
Tony Danza was the most
 incredible guy to work for.

1664
01:15:14,309 --> 01:15:15,443
- Yeah, I bet he was.

1665
01:15:15,476 --> 01:15:16,911
- That was fabulous.

1666
01:15:16,945 --> 01:15:19,714
- Hey, like, this is total
  long shot, but are you

1667
01:15:19,747 --> 01:15:21,416
free next week?

1668
01:15:21,449 --> 01:15:23,951
Are you free?
  - I might be, why?

1669
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:25,320
What have you got
  up your sleeve?

1670
01:15:25,353 --> 01:15:27,556
- Well, we're writers,
 we're from Australia.

1671
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,357
- We've got a new play
 that's opening the

1672
01:15:29,390 --> 01:15:31,960
New York Festival, we've
got about four minutes

1673
01:15:31,993 --> 01:15:33,828
to find a lead actor
 or else we're gonna be

1674
01:15:33,861 --> 01:15:35,530
shipped back to Australia.
  - With the bill for

1675
01:15:35,563 --> 01:15:38,767
the festival's losses.
 - OK, and what do you

1676
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:39,834
want me to do, then?

1677
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:41,002
- Have a read.

1678
01:15:41,035 --> 01:15:42,103
Do you want to
 look at the script?

1679
01:15:42,136 --> 01:15:43,104
- Say what?
 - Can you have a look

1680
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:43,905
at the script?
 - Yeah, sure,

1681
01:15:43,938 --> 01:15:45,373
let me look at it.

1682
01:15:45,406 --> 01:15:46,608
- Yeah, but like you only
  have to do the opening

1683
01:15:46,641 --> 01:15:48,076
and closing monologue.
 - But it's not like

1684
01:15:48,109 --> 01:15:49,311
an audition or anything, I
 mean, you're Neville McBebee,

1685
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:50,679
your work in Cheers and
Family Ties is just--

1686
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:52,113
- I cried in that,
  too, by the way.

1687
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:54,416
- When Virtue left you
 in Days of Our Lives.

1688
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:56,951
- Yeah, what do you
 want me to read?

1689
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,987
- Page 96.
  - OK.

1690
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,257
You want to give me a
little synopsis on this?

1691
01:16:02,290 --> 01:16:04,926
- So, like, your boyfriend's
 been hit by a car,

1692
01:16:04,959 --> 01:16:07,295
he's in hospital, he's
 probably gonna die,

1693
01:16:07,328 --> 01:16:09,264
the family won't
let you see him,

1694
01:16:09,297 --> 01:16:11,665
and the speech there,
 it's to the father.

1695
01:16:11,699 --> 01:16:13,067
So just from.

1696
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:13,936
- OK.

1697
01:16:15,336 --> 01:16:17,472
He might not last the
  night, and you guys got me

1698
01:16:17,505 --> 01:16:19,207
waiting outside like a dog.

1699
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,242
I get it, you guys
 don't want me here.

1700
01:16:21,275 --> 01:16:23,478
But he's the most important
 person in my life.

1701
01:16:23,511 --> 01:16:25,513
I felt that the
  moment I met him.

1702
01:16:25,546 --> 01:16:27,482
When the Tigers won,
 I thought he was gonna

1703
01:16:27,515 --> 01:16:28,984
punch me in the face.

1704
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,919
But instead he looked at
  me with the most beautiful

1705
01:16:30,952 --> 01:16:33,488
softness in his eyes,
 offered me a beer,

1706
01:16:33,521 --> 01:16:35,056
and shook my hand.

1707
01:16:35,089 --> 01:16:37,092
Neither one of us
  choose to be this,

1708
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,960
but we did choose each other.

1709
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:40,295
You can't keep me away.

1710
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:42,497
I have to see him, please.

1711
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:45,500
- That was mind blowing.

1712
01:16:45,533 --> 01:16:46,935
That was amazing.

1713
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:50,205
- So, when do you
  want to start now?

1714
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,640
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1715
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:54,608
You know what, I can't
 rehearse because I got

1716
01:16:54,642 --> 01:16:57,212
a guest role on Big Bang Theory.

1717
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:59,014
- That's OK, that was awesome.

1718
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:00,848
- You know what,
 we'll make it work.

1719
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:02,718
- Can I just ask, why?

1720
01:17:04,452 --> 01:17:07,355
- Why, because when I
 was a kid, just like

1721
01:17:07,388 --> 01:17:11,425
you guys, I come from
  Queens, I had a big dream,

1722
01:17:11,459 --> 01:17:14,062
and you guys remind me of that.

1723
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:18,867
Plus I'll get some props
playing a fruitcake.

1724
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:22,571
(dramatic music)

1725
01:17:27,175 --> 01:17:28,943
- Friend requested
  Beth Bernstein.

1726
01:17:28,976 --> 01:17:30,178
- Oh yeah?

1727
01:17:30,211 --> 01:17:31,446
Did she accept?
  - She has six kids
