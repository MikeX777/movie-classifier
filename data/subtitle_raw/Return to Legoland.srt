1
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:19,459
Back to those days

2
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,959
Tomuś! 5-10-15!

3
00:02:40,626 --> 00:02:41,876
Hello.

4
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:43,375
Hello.

5
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,042
Teeth!

6
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:52,209
Tomek...

7
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:54,542
Hang on a minute…

8
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:57,834
Don’t „Hang on a minute” me here.
I’ve said brush Your teeth.

9
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:05,292
You watch.
It’ll all be rotten.

10
00:03:24,834 --> 00:03:25,918
Toilet seat!

11
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:30,876
Load the washing machine.

12
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:32,250
Later.

13
00:03:32,334 --> 00:03:33,894
There is no later. Now, please.

14
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:37,250
You don’t have any clean
underwear for tomorrow.

15
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,334
Flush the toilet!

16
00:04:15,876 --> 00:04:18,310
You know, when we go to America,

17
00:04:18,334 --> 00:04:20,709
you’ll have to learn English anyway.

18
00:04:20,834 --> 00:04:22,250
Have you done your homework?

19
00:04:22,459 --> 00:04:23,518
I’ve been assigned no homework.

20
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:24,519
Are you sure?

21
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,918
I’m sure.

22
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,709
Chicken broth?
You know I don’t like it.

23
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,792
Moskit’s cousin went to the US
and he said kids learn languages fast…

24
00:04:39,876 --> 00:04:41,167
What did he say?

25
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,250
…but adults don’t.

26
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:43,000
What?

27
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,459
What did he say?

28
00:04:44,626 --> 00:04:46,918
Kids can learn languages quickly.

29
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,125
And you’re an adult.

30
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:52,209
So, if You don’t know English,

31
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,417
Americans won’t treat You seriously.

32
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,459
You won’t find any good job.

33
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,626
Me and dad are not going to support You.

34
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:01,727
Oh, really?
Smarty, let’s pretend I support You now.

35
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:04,167
And You’ll support me later.

36
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,250
Yeah, sure.

37
00:05:06,626 --> 00:05:07,626
What is it?

38
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,042
A carbonite defroster.

39
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:13,709
I’ll be able to defrost... the captain.

40
00:05:14,417 --> 00:05:15,897
There was one in Jabba’s palace, too.

41
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:17,709
I love you.

42
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:21,167
- My little boy.
- Leave me alone.

43
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,375
Hey, You haven’t
brushed Your teeth yet fibber, have You.

44
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,626
- I have.
- No, You haven’t.

45
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:26,667
I have.

46
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,245
You’ve heard me brushing it.

47
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,417
Put Your new trainers on.

48
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,209
These are cooler.

49
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:43,518
What was the reason I’ve bought new one?

50
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:45,209
I don’t know, it was your idea.

51
00:05:45,292 --> 00:05:46,292
Don’t rip Your trousers.

52
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:47,626
And you stop smoking.

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,542
Are you going out?

54
00:05:57,626 --> 00:06:00,042
Mum told me to study, but…

55
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,245
she is in the church anyway.

56
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:11,459
Open the door, Militia!

57
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,542
Be quiet. Mum is sleeping.

58
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,542
Besides You say "Police".

59
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,459
Pussy! Pussy! Pussy!

60
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:23,751
Pussy, pussy!

61
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,542
I’ll get you, you dick!

62
00:06:31,209 --> 00:06:33,417
So where do we go, Tomek?

63
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:41,209
The USA is about to finish the race.

64
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,375
You're a frog.

65
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:50,167
Hey You there!
Get down the tree now!

66
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,042
Shitheads! Now!

67
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,250
Come on! Follow him.

68
00:06:54,667 --> 00:06:56,626
Get that Polonez! Get him!

69
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,542
Come on! Go!

70
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,209
Geez, you’re so lame.

71
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:02,542
You’re lame, Moskit. Jesus...

72
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:23,351
...two, three!

73
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,542
There it goes.

74
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,334
Mom!

75
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,834
Look at this. Mom bought it today.

76
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:30,000
Mom!

77
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:30,792
Is that LEGO?

78
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:31,918
Yes. The newest set.

79
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,209
Toss me some sandwiches!

80
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,125
I go for the plane.

81
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:36,542
It’s the latest. Flip it over.

82
00:07:36,584 --> 00:07:38,626
The pirate ship you’ve always wanted.

83
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,834
And a racetrack!

84
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,083
And a car park.

85
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,334
Dibs on that!

86
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:44,751
Catch!

87
00:07:47,209 --> 00:07:48,959
You asked me how I feel here.

88
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:53,209
What can I tell you, I work 10,
sometimes 12 hours a day.

89
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,626
This city never sleeps.

90
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,834
It’s completely different.

91
00:07:58,876 --> 00:08:00,167
You’ll like it, you’ll see.

92
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:03,792
Everything’s huge. There are limos...

93
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,959
I can’t describe it using words.

94
00:08:07,709 --> 00:08:09,727
I work in a huge skyscraper.

95
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:11,711
I take an elevator to get
to 45th floor every day.

96
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,042
Can you imagine? 45th.

97
00:08:14,834 --> 00:08:16,154
That’s where my radio station is.

98
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,250
It’s cool.

99
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,209
Maybe it’s not the biggest
radio station around, but…

100
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,417
work is keeping me sane.

101
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:25,626
I miss you, Beetle.

102
00:08:27,042 --> 00:08:30,167
When I look at the sun, I say to myself:

103
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:33,351
It’s amazing the same
sun shines on my Beetle,

104
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,417
who is asleep now.

105
00:08:35,751 --> 00:08:38,459
Do you still want that LEGO ship?

106
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,542
If so, tell me which one specifically,
I’ll buy it for you.

107
00:08:41,626 --> 00:08:46,042
You know that Malinowski
always keeps his word.

108
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,626
- Repeat.
- Malinowski always keeps his word.

109
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:51,375
Very good.

110
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:53,584
Time for your bath.

111
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,042
Come on now.

112
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,500
It’s just a matter of time.

113
00:08:59,876 --> 00:09:01,375
I love you, Beetle.

114
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,500
I love you too.

115
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:11,751
Listen. That ship is very important.
Write down the model.

116
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,250
6285.

117
00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,334
I repeat: 6285.

118
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,125
6285.

119
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:21,209
No!

120
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,000
Have You heard his voice crackling.
He has a mutation.

121
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:25,268
You are mutation on Your own.
Give it back.

122
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:26,959
I want to record something for dad.

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,334
- May I ask for something, too?
- Like what?

124
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:30,626
I’d like to have perfume.

125
00:09:30,709 --> 00:09:32,459
- Ooh, perfume.
- Why can’t I?

126
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:34,250
What? Sure...

127
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:37,626
What have you done it for?

128
00:09:42,918 --> 00:09:44,042
Well, that’s something new.

129
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,375
According to Malicka,
the capital of Poland is Kluczbork.

130
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,167
Warsaw is the capital.

131
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,226
What are You waiting for, then?

132
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,042
Find it on the map, child.
For Christ’s sake!

133
00:09:55,584 --> 00:09:57,167
That big red one!

134
00:09:57,417 --> 00:10:00,042
I see you, and I hear you.

135
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:05,876
As usual, Malicka. Dumb as a rock.

136
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,101
Luckily, vocational school
is just round the corner.

137
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:10,167
along with teenage pregnancy too.

138
00:10:10,751 --> 00:10:11,876
Sit down. F.

139
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:16,542
Come in, please.

140
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:20,834
Sit down, sit down.

141
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:23,792
I’d like...

142
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,417
I’d like you to welcome

143
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,334
your new friend.

144
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,626
She was transferred here
and she’ll need your guidance.

145
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,125
Your support.

146
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:35,959
Your friendship.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,250
Come in, come in...

148
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,751
Our new acquisition!

149
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:46,167
- Good bye!
- Good bye!

150
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,500
Do you know her?

151
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,459
New girl, you’ll sit with Malicka.

152
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,083
Her name is Marta.

153
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,560
She moved here
from the Kosmonautów estate,

154
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:02,685
their school was overcrowded,

155
00:11:02,709 --> 00:11:03,959
or something.

156
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,626
Her father is a lawyer.

157
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,751
Or something.

158
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,751
And has a Mercedes.

159
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:11,876
A Mercedes?

160
00:11:13,334 --> 00:11:14,792
Her dad has one.

161
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:16,959
Does she have a boyfriend?

162
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:18,584
She doesn’t.

163
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:21,876
I mean... she did, but not anymore.

164
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,959
They had an argue, or something,

165
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,683
He wasn’t a good match
for her apprently.

166
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,876
Because he listened to metal...
or something.

167
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:32,042
And she has a VCR.

168
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:33,334
A VCR?

169
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,834
You’re a VCR, Moskit.

170
00:11:35,834 --> 00:11:37,751
She wants to trade tapes.

171
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:40,500
What tapes?

172
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:42,167
Video tapes.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Video...

174
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,250
So forget about it, Słabiak.

175
00:11:46,709 --> 00:11:50,500
Without a VCR you don’t stand a chance.

176
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:53,834
Hey, Malicka,

177
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:55,959
let me touch your boob.

178
00:11:56,334 --> 00:11:57,334
Why?

179
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,894
Have you got boner?

180
00:11:59,918 --> 00:12:00,918
No!

181
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:05,500
What are you laughing at?

182
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:07,542
Firstly,

183
00:12:07,918 --> 00:12:09,751
dating a girl is about

184
00:12:09,876 --> 00:12:11,250
just... understanding her.

185
00:12:11,751 --> 00:12:13,250
She must feel understood.

186
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,500
She must feel loved, right?

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Secondly,

188
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:18,751
she must know that you care.

189
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,626
And... you can’t say anything dumb,
or you’ll ruin everything.

190
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,918
Thirdly, Malicka said
you don’t stand a chance.

191
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,459
Thirdly, Malicka is dumb

192
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:30,042
and doesn’t even know where Warsaw is.

193
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,292
What can she know about women?

194
00:12:32,417 --> 00:12:34,250
Much less a new girl in our class?

195
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:37,083
I don’t need a stupid VCR to date her.

196
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,959
As long as I get a rental card.

197
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,042
I’ll rent a cool film,
one she likes, and...

198
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:45,367
We’ll swap videotapes with each other
and not only that.

199
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:50,709
Hold on, not only that?

200
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:51,876
What do You mean?

201
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,125
Don’t tell me, Malina, you don’t know
what dating a girl is all about.

202
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,083
Please, enlighten me.

203
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,334
Dating a girl means that
You can eat her face eventually.

204
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:01,626
You know...

205
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:04,167
Ew...

206
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:05,209
Why, ew?

207
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:07,500
You know nothing about
picking girls up.

208
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:09,751
Oh yeah? Watch this then.

209
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,334
Hey, Natalia!

210
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,417
What?

211
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,042
You have shit in your hair!

212
00:13:16,584 --> 00:13:17,584
No, I don’t.

213
00:13:17,792 --> 00:13:19,918
The other hair! If you have any!

214
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:20,751
Get lost.

215
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,042
Piss off, Słabiak.

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,626
See? They both talked to me!

217
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,542
Hey, Malina.
What do you think about it?

218
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:29,728
About what?

219
00:13:29,752 --> 00:13:30,976
About new girl.

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,250
Oh, about new one?

221
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:33,918
She’s interesting.

222
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:35,686
Pretty.

223
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,167
Very pretty, really.

224
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,375
She has a cool style.

225
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:42,500
Different than anyone else at school.

226
00:13:43,292 --> 00:13:44,918
She’s very interesting.

227
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:48,459
I haven’t asked if You like her,
but if I have a shot.

228
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:51,083
Nobody else has a chance.

229
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,334
Frankfurters!

230
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,626
Handsome devils.

231
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,292
Mom, please.

232
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,959
I can’t help it.
You have handsome friends.

233
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,626
Not on the cards.

234
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:11,626
Alright, boys.

235
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,417
If you need anything,
I’ll be in my room.

236
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,167
Thank you, Miss Ewa. As always!

237
00:14:18,876 --> 00:14:21,250
I would give anything for mother
like Yours Moskit.

238
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:22,459
Shmoskit!

239
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,542
Come on. Jeez.

240
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:28,500
Besides, if I don’t score with
the new girl, I’ll just do your mom.

241
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,209
Go suck a lemon!

242
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:41,125
Who’s that guy?

243
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,250
I don’t know.

244
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,589
You don’t know?
Have You talked with each other?

245
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,042
I honestly don’t know.

246
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,626
Bugger off, Słabiak.

247
00:14:47,834 --> 00:14:51,250
If you want to know more,
go ask my mom.

248
00:14:53,918 --> 00:14:54,959
Have you heard that?

249
00:14:56,918 --> 00:14:57,918
Game’s over!

250
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,083
But they’ve just started.

251
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:01,000
We’re leaving.

252
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,709
Come on, Daniel.

253
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,292
Can’t even eat a wiener in peace...

254
00:15:08,918 --> 00:15:10,709
How many times
have you watched Star Wars.

255
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,334
I don’t know, 10?

256
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
15? 50?

257
00:15:13,834 --> 00:15:14,542
Oh God.

258
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:15,667
Something like that.

259
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,667
That’s a lot.

260
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,959
What are you laughing at?

261
00:15:19,542 --> 00:15:20,751
He laughs at everything.

262
00:15:21,626 --> 00:15:22,751
That’s true. Hey, Malina!

263
00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:25,918
Isn’t that your dad? By that gate?

264
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:27,751
Beetle!

265
00:15:29,709 --> 00:15:30,751
Come on, Beetle.

266
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:31,918
Go!

267
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,250
Go to daddy.

268
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:39,918
Dad?

269
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,584
Well hello!

270
00:15:45,751 --> 00:15:47,167
- Hi.
- Hi!

271
00:15:47,334 --> 00:15:50,542
What did you do with my little son?

272
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,209
God, You’ve grown up.

273
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,876
Will you help me with that?

274
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:58,959
Sure.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,792
I’ll take that. Careful.

276
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,209
What are you doing here?

277
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,250
What do you mean? I came back.

278
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,209
Are You back home?

279
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:15,667
What are these suitcases?

280
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:18,167
Come here and look something.

281
00:16:29,334 --> 00:16:30,959
- Alek.
- Hello.

282
00:16:38,626 --> 00:16:40,542
I’ll make something to drink.

283
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,500
I need to wash my hands.

284
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,709
May I wash my hands?

285
00:16:45,834 --> 00:16:47,959
Yes, I’ll get you a towel.

286
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,751
Pass it to Your dad.

287
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:02,375
Here You go.

288
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,250
Why haven’t You told
us You are coming back?

289
00:17:06,334 --> 00:17:11,250
To avoid the waiting, the nerves.
Surprises are the best.

290
00:17:13,918 --> 00:17:18,209
Actually, I was scared
no one would be happy I was coming.

291
00:17:19,584 --> 00:17:21,667
But we were supposed to visit you, right?

292
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:22,876
Gosh, you’ve grown.

293
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:25,834
I thought...

294
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,125
I really miss you a lot.

295
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:33,167
I love you so much,
I couldn’t take one more day apart.

296
00:17:33,876 --> 00:17:35,125
You look great.

297
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:39,042
So we’re not going to New York?

298
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,584
Beetle! New York’s come to you!
Look!

299
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,209
Look at this.

300
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:49,334
What’s in here?

301
00:17:50,751 --> 00:17:51,751
Look inside.

302
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,209
Pull that thing.

303
00:17:54,334 --> 00:17:55,417
It’s stuck.

304
00:17:55,626 --> 00:17:57,334
What do you mean stuck?
Let me try.

305
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,417
What’s inside?

306
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:02,083
Here!

307
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:03,709
Look.

308
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:06,167
Records. Nirvana.

309
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:08,584
Look, a laser disc.

310
00:18:10,334 --> 00:18:11,959
Oh sugar, it is…

311
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,667
Alright. There’s something for mom, too.

312
00:18:16,792 --> 00:18:17,876
Wait a moment...

313
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,459
Here you go.

314
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:30,709
You are crazy.

315
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:31,751
Yes.

316
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:36,542
Well?

317
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:39,042
Put it on.

318
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,417
It’s beautiful.

319
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,250
You have to put it on. Go on.

320
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,250
Try it on.

321
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:46,125
Look, diecast models here.

322
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,751
The most recent Matchbox cars.

323
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:52,751
Shoes. I had to eyeball it,
I don’t know if they fit You.

324
00:18:52,876 --> 00:18:53,876
Don’t get them dirty.

325
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,584
I’m sure they’ll fit!

326
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,250
This is for me.

327
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,876
“Girl” means girl?

328
00:19:04,959 --> 00:19:06,042
Yes.

329
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:07,375
This is for mom.

330
00:19:09,042 --> 00:19:10,042
And this?

331
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:13,834
Is it for Beetle?

332
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,542
No, no. Leave that.

333
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,417
Right, listen...

334
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:25,852
Look, I’ve thought about Lego set…

335
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:28,292
And I’ll just buy it for you here, ok?

336
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,417
I just don’t know which
You are up for.

337
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,792
Will You buy me that set?

338
00:19:31,876 --> 00:19:32,876
Sure.

339
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,375
Mum, have you heard that?
Dad’s gonna buy me Lego I want.

340
00:19:37,334 --> 00:19:39,375
Wow! Dad. Look at that.

341
00:19:41,834 --> 00:19:42,834
Well?

342
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,626
Man, You are so beautiful.

343
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:53,876
Beetle, you have the most beautiful mom
in the world. Do you get it?

344
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,876
It must have been terribly expensive.
You shouldn’t have.

345
00:19:56,918 --> 00:19:58,876
It was Wanda’s idea.

346
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
You can put it on for special events,
nights out.

347
00:20:05,751 --> 00:20:07,167
Do you remember this?

348
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:08,292
I do...

349
00:20:13,334 --> 00:20:14,834
I came back.

350
00:20:17,209 --> 00:20:18,667
You came back.

351
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:22,876
I couldn’t be without you anymore.

352
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:49,667
Hi...

353
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,626
You’re not sleeping?

354
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:59,375
I had to make myself sure it’s not a dream,
that he is really back.

355
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,709
I can’t believe it either.

356
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:08,500
So, what do we do?

357
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,584
We don’t have to learn English.

358
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:17,375
What do we do with dad?

359
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,417
You know...

360
00:21:20,042 --> 00:21:22,959
Nothing. Everything will be fine.
Just don’t think about it.

361
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:26,918
I feel sorry we’re not going to the USA.

362
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:27,959
Son...

363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,709
You feel sorry when you are like
a bull in a china shop.

364
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:34,626
Besides, not everything in America
is as cool as it seems to be.

365
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,167
How is it possible?

366
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:37,907
Everyone says it’s really cool.

367
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:38,959
Nah.

368
00:21:39,334 --> 00:21:41,459
Food, for instance,
You would hate it.

369
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:44,167
Bread tastes like a rubber.

370
00:21:44,709 --> 00:21:46,584
They don’t know what "cream" is actually.

371
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:48,292
Quark? Forget it!

372
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:50,959
And mayonnaise?

373
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:53,042
Their mayo has no taste.

374
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:56,292
People come off as nice, right?
They’ll ask “how are you?”and stuff,

375
00:21:56,334 --> 00:21:58,792
but actually no one cares.

376
00:21:58,834 --> 00:22:01,083
Money and connections
are the most important.

377
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:02,834
Let’s leave it here.

378
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:08,042
Is it working?

379
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,042
No, it’s broken.

380
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,375
But it’s not broken.

381
00:22:12,584 --> 00:22:14,500
Is Your bike OK?

382
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,459
No. It’s all messed up.

383
00:22:16,584 --> 00:22:17,584
Let me look at it.

384
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:20,876
Oh, there it is.

385
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,584
Gotcha, pinhole.

386
00:22:25,667 --> 00:22:27,751
Alright, we put patch on it now.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,626
Except it’s locked,
and I don’t remember the lock combination.

388
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:31,834
063.

389
00:22:33,459 --> 00:22:35,292
Hand the towel over to me.

390
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:40,667
Alright.

391
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:43,459
Spin them wheels, Beetle.

392
00:22:43,584 --> 00:22:44,667
Great. Thanks.

393
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:50,375
Everything Ok?

394
00:22:50,417 --> 00:22:52,375
Just don’t get too sweaty, right?

395
00:22:53,918 --> 00:22:56,209
Rajmund! Have You heard Me?

396
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,876
Yes, not too sweaty!

397
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,334
Hello Eve.

398
00:22:59,876 --> 00:23:01,584
Oh, hello Alek.

399
00:23:02,459 --> 00:23:04,125
So You’ve decided to come back?

400
00:23:04,792 --> 00:23:06,417
I wouldn’t.

401
00:23:06,626 --> 00:23:08,226
Well, I wanted to stay,

402
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,000
but I missed you.

403
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:14,167
Alek, You haven’t grown up yet, have You?

404
00:23:14,209 --> 00:23:16,792
Sometimes it’s good to be childish, Eve.

405
00:23:16,918 --> 00:23:17,918
Alek…

406
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,792
It’s good you’re back,
Boredom’s just begun around here.

407
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,792
- Hello.
- Hello.

408
00:23:41,918 --> 00:23:42,918
Hello.

409
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,500
How can I help you?

410
00:23:44,959 --> 00:23:45,976
Which one is it?

411
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,811
This one.

412
00:23:46,835 --> 00:23:49,209
Could we look at the ship?

413
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,417
The red one?

414
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,000
Yes.

415
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:52,375
Here you go.

416
00:23:54,292 --> 00:23:56,167
Well, This is the moment.

417
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,375
See?

418
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:02,125
When Malinowski promises something...

419
00:24:02,292 --> 00:24:04,834
- He always keeps his word.
- That’s right.

420
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:09,125
Gosh, so many blocks.
Wait till the guys see this,

421
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,209
their potatoes
will turn green with envy.

422
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,542
What is it, Beetle?

423
00:24:16,042 --> 00:24:17,042
What’s up?

424
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,584
Come on. You can tell me.

425
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:22,709
See, I’d like...

426
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,626
I’d like that VCR.

427
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:29,250
What about the ship?

428
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:34,083
I’d rather have the VCR.

429
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:37,959
Can you show us the VCR?

430
00:24:48,959 --> 00:24:50,292
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

431
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:52,667
Long time no see.
Back to your neighborhood.

432
00:24:52,834 --> 00:24:55,167
We’re going to rent some video tapes.

433
00:24:55,334 --> 00:24:56,751
I bought my son a VCR.

434
00:24:56,834 --> 00:24:57,918
Very good.

435
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,083
I bought mine a computer.
Children are the future.

436
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,667
Let Your son to come over one day.

437
00:25:03,834 --> 00:25:06,292
Miłosz will gladly show him
his computer.

438
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,292
Right, Miłosz?

439
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,375
Yes, dad.

440
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,292
Come over to play a computer game.

441
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:12,125
Well, there you are, then.

442
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:13,409
Great. Thank you so much. Bye.

443
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,459
Good bye.

444
00:25:16,834 --> 00:25:18,334
A friend from school?

445
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:21,709
The best student in our class.

446
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:24,459
But he’s never talked to me before.

447
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,000
See? Didn’t I say
everything would change?

448
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,083
Hi.

449
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:29,292
Oh, mommy. Hi.

450
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:31,292
Come with us.

451
00:25:32,083 --> 00:25:33,000
Is that the LEGO?

452
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:34,083
LEGO, hah.

453
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:35,834
It’s a VCR.

454
00:25:36,125 --> 00:25:37,125
A VCR?

455
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,417
Alek!

456
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:48,959
You know, I don’t usually let kids
rent videos on their own.

457
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:50,792
Something is stolen, right?

458
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,918
And it’s out of my pocket.

459
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,959
But I’ll make an exception for you.

460
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,667
Thank you so much.

461
00:25:58,751 --> 00:26:00,792
Mr. Aleksander Malinowski, right?

462
00:26:00,876 --> 00:26:01,876
Yes.

463
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,375
I tell you something…

464
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:06,918
I liked listening to you on the radio.

465
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,918
But You are not ‘on the air’ lately.

466
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,250
Oh, my husband was in America.

467
00:26:11,459 --> 00:26:12,834
USA!

468
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:14,792
Oh, sweet emigration.

469
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,310
You have to be there to understand.

470
00:26:16,334 --> 00:26:17,334
Have You been there?

471
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:18,709
See this?

472
00:26:18,918 --> 00:26:19,935
Where do You think I have it all from?

473
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:22,375
Why are You taking five tapes at a clip?

474
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:24,542
You know what?

475
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:30,375
Kids these days will rent
even ten at a time.

476
00:26:32,209 --> 00:26:33,667
It’s a good business.

477
00:26:34,083 --> 00:26:35,626
I know what I’m talking about.

478
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:40,918
Are You going to set some business up?

479
00:26:42,709 --> 00:26:47,209
Money might be here now,
but what about tomorrow?

480
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,667
Clean.

481
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:54,792
See?

482
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,709
Return it in the same condition.

483
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Right.

484
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:04,334
Alright. Rewind.

485
00:27:04,417 --> 00:27:07,792
Romek said there’s a fine if You don’t.

486
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,542
Give it here.

487
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,000
So, one more? Before bed? Alright.

488
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:16,167
What’s in there?

489
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:17,709
Can we talk?

490
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:19,292
- Can we talk?
- Sure.

491
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:22,667
Oh! “Terminator” is good.

492
00:27:23,459 --> 00:27:24,792
What about “Commando”?

493
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:25,584
What?

494
00:27:25,667 --> 00:27:28,500
- We have “Commando”.
- Ok. pop it on.

495
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:39,334
What about work?
What are you going to do?

496
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:43,000
Bags.

497
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:44,876
Bags?

498
00:27:45,042 --> 00:27:47,292
Yeah, today with Beetle

499
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:49,876
we saw this woman at the store.

500
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,918
She had a sports bag.

501
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,542
- Right?
- Right.

502
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Very pretty.

503
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:58,292
The bag, he means.

504
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:00,959
A sports bag. Colorful.

505
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:04,375
That’s my idea, I’m going to sell them.

506
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,792
You want to sell them?

507
00:28:05,959 --> 00:28:08,292
Well, not personally,
I’ll just order them.

508
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:10,792
We’ll buy them in bulk, right?

509
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:12,542
In America.

510
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:16,751
Konrad will bring them from New York,
we’ll find someone to sell them here.

511
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:18,375
Colorful!

512
00:28:20,626 --> 00:28:21,918
I don’t know...

513
00:28:22,751 --> 00:28:24,584
What about radio?

514
00:28:27,042 --> 00:28:31,167
Whenever I have an idea,
you’re the first one to criticize.

515
00:28:32,167 --> 00:28:35,334
As soon as I say something,
you’re against it.

516
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:37,209
Alek...

517
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:40,000
I just really like listening to you.

518
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,083
You know what?

519
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,768
You know nothing,
but you pry into my business.

520
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:43,792
Always the same way.

521
00:28:43,918 --> 00:28:47,167
Just once, for fuck’s sake,
You could listen to me.

522
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:50,584
Listen what I have to say.
What I think, what my ideas are.

523
00:28:51,959 --> 00:28:52,959
Radio!

524
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,626
Radio, shmadio.

525
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
May I?

526
00:29:02,459 --> 00:29:03,459
Yes.

527
00:29:05,334 --> 00:29:07,101
Is that your castle?

528
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,125
Yeah.

529
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:09,834
I’ve just modified it a bit.

530
00:29:10,167 --> 00:29:12,542
because I thought that...

531
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:16,918
when you were in the US,
working at the radio,

532
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:18,500
this was your boss,

533
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,918
He used an elevator to get to the top floor

534
00:29:23,959 --> 00:29:26,626
and can go in here,

535
00:29:26,876 --> 00:29:29,334
you’re sitting here, with a microphone.

536
00:29:29,876 --> 00:29:32,375
An aerial is here
and everyone can hear You.

537
00:29:32,542 --> 00:29:34,709
Look at You. So smart You are.

538
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:39,000
Is it a set You got from aunt Wanda?

539
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:40,083
Yes.

540
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:42,959
I can build anything with it.

541
00:29:45,959 --> 00:29:49,667
Don’t you regret
not getting that ship you wanted?

542
00:29:49,876 --> 00:29:51,125
Well, a little bit.

543
00:29:51,209 --> 00:29:53,709
But the VCR is great, too.

544
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,626
Tell me, when I was away
did mom go out with someone?

545
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,542
Hung out with someone?

546
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,626
Someone?

547
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:03,209
I don’t know, did you have any guests,
or something?

548
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:04,334
No.

549
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:05,834
Just, you know,

550
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:07,959
auntie, granny.

551
00:30:09,334 --> 00:30:11,375
Mum’s friend.

552
00:30:11,459 --> 00:30:13,042
Lady with three kids.

553
00:30:13,417 --> 00:30:14,959
- From theatre.
- Elwira?

554
00:30:15,042 --> 00:30:16,042
Yes, Elwira.

555
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,125
Mirek.

556
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,000
Uncle Mirek?

557
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,751
No. Mirek.

558
00:30:24,209 --> 00:30:25,500
Mom’s friend.

559
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,834
They had coffee here once.

560
00:30:31,209 --> 00:30:33,292
I don’t like it when you yell at mom.

561
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,834
Beetle, that wasn’t yelling. Come on.

562
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,518
I only had to express myself,

563
00:30:40,542 --> 00:30:42,584
you know dissatisfaction.

564
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:45,751
Don’t worry about mom, she’s...

565
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,626
Women have their, you know, issues.

566
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,918
Their moods.

567
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:56,918
You’ll find out yourself,
can guarantee You.

568
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,834
How did you meet mom, anyway?

569
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,959
She was still at university.

570
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,417
I went to see her performance.

571
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:09,083
It was love at first sight.

572
00:31:09,292 --> 00:31:11,125
And... yeah.

573
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,334
What did you do to get her?

574
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,083
You don’t “get” women, Beetle.

575
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,709
You have to charm them.

576
00:31:20,584 --> 00:31:22,751
Like a knight in shining armor.

577
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:27,417
I went to her wardrobe.

578
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,375
I didn’t have a plan, right?

579
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:32,042
I chatted her up.

580
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:34,834
She turned around, and I said:

581
00:31:36,083 --> 00:31:39,542
“Would you like to go to
the Easter Islands with me?”

582
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:43,375
- But where is that?
- Far away, Beetle.

583
00:31:43,417 --> 00:31:45,834
As far away as you can imagine.

584
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:47,334
And that was it?

585
00:31:47,417 --> 00:31:48,417
What did you expect?

586
00:31:48,626 --> 00:31:49,792
I was improvising.

587
00:31:54,167 --> 00:31:57,667
Would you like to go to
the Easter Islands with me?

588
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,834
You’re weird.

589
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:02,709
I’m not weird. I’m spontaneous.

590
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,459
Like, when?

591
00:32:05,083 --> 00:32:07,000
After classes.

592
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:10,792
Silence!

593
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:15,959
Please, go ahead.

594
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,334
Attention. Cheese!

595
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:20,042
One, two, three.

596
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,751
One more.

597
00:32:25,876 --> 00:32:26,876
Thank you.

598
00:32:27,918 --> 00:32:29,667
I like to come up here.

599
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:32,292
You can make Your mind up here.

600
00:32:32,459 --> 00:32:33,459
To be on You own.

601
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:36,250
To stone.

602
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:39,500
For example.

603
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,792
I haven’t knew the river is so close
to the school.

604
00:32:42,876 --> 00:32:44,375
Well, You know now.

605
00:32:44,709 --> 00:32:47,500
Try. It’s good fun.

606
00:32:51,042 --> 00:32:52,751
Cool...

607
00:33:10,876 --> 00:33:13,292
Have You ever been up there?

608
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:15,626
You’re entertaining.

609
00:33:15,792 --> 00:33:17,250
Do you like music?

610
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,459
Yes! A lot.

611
00:33:18,626 --> 00:33:20,417
My dad is a radio host.

612
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,626
He knows music from around the world.

613
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,792
For example...

614
00:33:23,834 --> 00:33:27,209
Red Hot Chili Peppers. Faith No More.

615
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:29,375
Public Enemy.

616
00:33:30,584 --> 00:33:31,584
Do you know them?

617
00:33:31,626 --> 00:33:32,626
Beastie Boys?

618
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:34,751
Never heard of them.

619
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:37,250
Then what do you like?

620
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:38,334
New Kids?

621
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:40,417
Don’t insult me.

622
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,250
New Kids are for kids!

623
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,334
There’s only one real band. Wanna hear?

624
00:33:44,459 --> 00:33:45,459
Sure!

625
00:33:45,584 --> 00:33:46,584
Oops. Jesus.

626
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,500
Oh, they’re on a cable.

627
00:33:58,709 --> 00:33:59,709
Cool.

628
00:34:00,292 --> 00:34:01,834
Electronic.

629
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,918
Where are they from?

630
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,375
England.

631
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:09,626
Depeche Mode. It’s French.

632
00:34:10,334 --> 00:34:14,250
And “Violator” is their latest album.
It’s amazing!

633
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:19,083
Is that why your clothes are so cool?

634
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:23,542
Hey, you!

635
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:25,167
Run.

636
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,876
Hi.

637
00:34:31,792 --> 00:34:33,042
Just relax.

638
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:35,292
Everything’s fine.

639
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:39,417
There was this gentleman here today.

640
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:41,500
Alek, tell him!

641
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,083
What?

642
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:46,042
I’m going back to radio, big whoop.

643
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:50,083
Dad is going to be the head editor.
The whole country will be listening!

644
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,000
That’s great.

645
00:34:52,792 --> 00:34:55,709
Could you play a song… just for me one day?
On the radio?

646
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:56,959
What?

647
00:34:57,375 --> 00:35:00,792
What do you think, we can just play
kid songs on the radio?

648
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:02,500
Why not?

649
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:04,209
I will, I will.

650
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:07,250
Maybe I’ll play you one, too...

651
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:10,584
What are you going to play me?

652
00:35:13,417 --> 00:35:15,334
Stevie Wonder.

653
00:35:16,042 --> 00:35:18,417
“I Just Called to Say I Love You”.

654
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,250
Tomek, go to your room.

655
00:35:20,459 --> 00:35:23,209
Geez, you’re gross.

656
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,351
Oh no.

657
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,560
Quiet.

658
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:38,667
I’ll check if he’s asleep.

659
00:36:03,959 --> 00:36:06,042
You look beautiful.

660
00:36:31,709 --> 00:36:34,500
I saw one with boobs like these once.

661
00:36:34,584 --> 00:36:35,584
Who?

662
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:37,292
Polish language teacher.

663
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:40,918
Yeah, she has huge ones.

664
00:36:41,042 --> 00:36:43,083
But she can’t speak German.

665
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:48,083
You don’t know what she does
after school.

666
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,876
Neither do I.

667
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,000
Maybe let’s leave it as it is.

668
00:36:58,459 --> 00:36:59,918
Hide it!

669
00:37:04,417 --> 00:37:05,709
How could you do this to me?!

670
00:37:05,792 --> 00:37:09,584
I called dibs on her!
Long before you, you understand?

671
00:37:09,876 --> 00:37:11,500
I called dibs on her, she was mine!

672
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:12,500
But...

673
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:14,709
what are you talking about?
We’ve just talked.

674
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,959
Yes You did like hell!
The whole school is saying you’re dating!

675
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,876
You get everything! That LEGO set,
new awesome shoes, the clothes, the VCR!

676
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,626
And what do I have?
Nothing!

677
00:37:26,834 --> 00:37:29,042
All I wanted was to be with her!

678
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:31,876
Come on, Moskit, let’s go.

679
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,375
We watched the new porn from Minias.
It’s awesome.

680
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:40,042
We were waiting for something to happen
to jerk off...

681
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,709
But nothing’s happened.

682
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:44,042
Maybe you have to wait longer
for an erection.

683
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:45,709
Here, I don’t need it anymore.

684
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:50,876
Bye, Tomek.

685
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:51,959
Bye...

686
00:37:52,709 --> 00:37:59,083
For he’s a jolly good fellow,

687
00:37:59,167 --> 00:38:02,167
for he’s a jolly good fellow,

688
00:38:02,626 --> 00:38:08,834
for Alek’s a jolly good fellow,

689
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:14,959
which nobody can deny!

690
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,167
Thank you, sit down.

691
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,000
Smile!

692
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,500
Well, You make out.

693
00:38:20,918 --> 00:38:23,209
We got it from the head of the station.

694
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,584
Try it if you like.

695
00:38:24,626 --> 00:38:25,876
No, thank you.

696
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,375
I’ll gladly try, if I may, uncle.

697
00:38:29,459 --> 00:38:30,083
Sure.

698
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:31,976
I’ve never had bourbon.

699
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,167
What does it taste like?

700
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:35,000
I’ve had it once, but...

701
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,083
Meh, like tea with a kick.

702
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:40,083
I prefer our vodka.

703
00:38:40,417 --> 00:38:41,937
What did you say the radio was called?

704
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,185
Heart Radio.

705
00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:45,250
My friend got a license.

706
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,626
So we’re broadcasting nationally.

707
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:50,417
New music.

708
00:38:50,792 --> 00:38:52,351
You won’t hear that on Radio 3.

709
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,792
This democracy thing is opening
the floodgates.

710
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,292
I’ll remember. Heart Radio.

711
00:38:58,417 --> 00:39:01,000
New stores, a new radio, new everything.

712
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:04,542
Poles are gullible,
they’ll even believe in God.

713
00:39:04,792 --> 00:39:05,876
Danka!

714
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,083
What?

715
00:39:07,167 --> 00:39:10,083
Must be a pity,
in Your opinion, things’ve changed, right?

716
00:39:10,167 --> 00:39:13,918
No more mutual admiration society,
no more party-sponsored getaways.

717
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:16,292
You know, it sucks.

718
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:21,334
At least I don’t hear that I owe my life

719
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:23,667
to Jesus and Wałęsa.

720
00:39:24,584 --> 00:39:26,542
Yeah, because Jaruzelski was so great.

721
00:39:27,042 --> 00:39:28,876
Especially during martial law.

722
00:39:30,626 --> 00:39:32,542
At least he knew what he was doing.

723
00:39:33,542 --> 00:39:34,626
You don’t.

724
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,059
Dad is going to sell bags as well.

725
00:39:39,083 --> 00:39:40,059
What?

726
00:39:40,083 --> 00:39:41,083
Bags?

727
00:39:41,209 --> 00:39:42,209
Son.

728
00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:44,876
Nothing surprises me.

729
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:48,626
Can You imagine,
Jaruś’s just opened pizza shop.

730
00:39:49,542 --> 00:39:52,042
He’s spent all his life on the couch,

731
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:53,918
hasn’t done a thing, right,

732
00:39:54,584 --> 00:39:57,918
and now he’ll serve pies up for a riff-raff.

733
00:39:58,083 --> 00:39:59,918
Really? Congratulations.

734
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh give me a break.

735
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,667
He is Tech University graduate.

736
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:07,209
Watch out,
or he’ll get rich and move out...

737
00:40:07,292 --> 00:40:08,459
Uncle...

738
00:40:10,334 --> 00:40:12,000
Come on, let him eat in peace.

739
00:40:12,751 --> 00:40:16,709
Careful, Jarek, it’s always been this way.
First it was mom and dad,

740
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:18,626
then Włodek, then the party,

741
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,226
and now you’re going to be supportive
for the rest of your life.

742
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:24,125
Unless she surprises us all
and finds a job.

743
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:27,042
How about you surprise me
with something, eh?

744
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:30,500
Big radio host.

745
00:40:30,584 --> 00:40:33,083
You think I don’t know
what had happened at Wanda’s?

746
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:36,375
Stop it, Danka.
It’s your brother’s birthday, leave him alone.

747
00:40:36,792 --> 00:40:37,542
Do you?

748
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:40,959
Me? I don’t want to spoil your party.

749
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,709
You don’t know shit.

750
00:40:43,751 --> 00:40:44,751
Uncle...

751
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:49,959
Stop it, Danka.
It’s your brother’s birthday, leave him alone.

752
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:53,876
It’s good that he came back home.

753
00:40:54,334 --> 00:40:56,292
Let’s drink to that.

754
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:58,876
I don't drink a toast to him
being drunk all the time.

755
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,125
Danka!

756
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:02,334
What do You think, darling?

757
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,834
How many times police were after you?

758
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:08,250
Wanda always had to bail you out.

759
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:11,876
Alek was sober! Tell her!

760
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,792
Stop it...

761
00:41:13,876 --> 00:41:15,083
He was jobless.

762
00:41:15,918 --> 00:41:18,334
Wanda barely managed to get him
a cleaning gig.

763
00:41:19,292 --> 00:41:20,876
But no, he’s Mr. Radio.

764
00:41:20,918 --> 00:41:21,918
Alek!

765
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:23,059
He was on booze constantly.

766
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,083
He fell by the wayside.

767
00:41:24,292 --> 00:41:26,042
He got fired.

768
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:28,918
Can you stop? Are you done?

769
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,250
- Dad, stay!
- Alek, please.

770
00:41:34,334 --> 00:41:35,375
Leave me!

771
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:36,918
He battered the shop down!

772
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:38,709
He was deported after!

773
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:42,125
- Well, Alek? Am I wrong?
- Fuck off!

774
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
Dad...

775
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:47,542
My apology for an incident.

776
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,083
But you could have told me.

777
00:41:52,334 --> 00:41:54,042
He pisses me off.

778
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,375
I really don’t know why
you’re still with him...

779
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,834
You’re such a smart, pretty woman.

780
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:02,125
He’s a very good father.

781
00:42:02,209 --> 00:42:03,626
Bah, I know better ones.

782
00:42:03,709 --> 00:42:05,334
Hey, are You a friend Spy-ris?

783
00:42:05,417 --> 00:42:07,584
Why are you eavesdropping on grown-ups?

784
00:42:13,709 --> 00:42:14,792
He’s drinking.

785
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,417
Stop it.

786
00:42:31,751 --> 00:42:33,876
It’s just Mrs. Janeczka.

787
00:42:35,918 --> 00:42:37,876
Why did auntie do that to us?

788
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:39,626
It’s not auntie’s fault.

789
00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:44,709
Dad got angry and went to the radio.
I wouldn’t worry about it.

790
00:43:18,250 --> 00:43:19,250
What?

791
00:43:20,042 --> 00:43:21,125
Breathe.

792
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,083
Breathe!

793
00:43:26,292 --> 00:43:27,500
Happy?

794
00:44:10,459 --> 00:44:11,667
What are you looking for?

795
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:13,459
Do we have any Anticol left?

796
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:16,626
I threw it out, it was expired.

797
00:44:18,459 --> 00:44:19,834
We’ll manage.

798
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,542
It’s not the first time.

799
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:24,083
1252 days.

800
00:44:24,751 --> 00:44:25,500
What?

801
00:44:25,709 --> 00:44:27,834
1252 days.

802
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:31,959
That’s how long dad was sober,
not counting USA. If what auntie said is true.

803
00:44:32,209 --> 00:44:33,584
God, you counted?

804
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:36,209
He can’t go anywhere.

805
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:41,959
I’ll lock you in here, and then we’ll get
the Anticol together. Like we used to.

806
00:44:44,751 --> 00:44:45,959
Daddy, were you drinking?

807
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:50,292
Were you?

808
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,709
What are you talking about?

809
00:44:53,083 --> 00:44:55,417
Absolutely not. Come on.

810
00:44:56,709 --> 00:44:58,334
I’m going to school now.

811
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,334
When I come back...

812
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:03,709
you’ll be lying here, ok?

813
00:45:04,918 --> 00:45:06,792
Don’t be silly, Tomuś.

814
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,751
Helunia...

815
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:11,834
Yes?

816
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,709
Darling, I have work today.
I’ll have to leave.

817
00:45:15,876 --> 00:45:17,756
Tomek, he really does have to go
to the station.

818
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:18,500
No.

819
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:19,792
Dad, you can’t.

820
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,000
You can’t go to the radio.

821
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:23,792
Alek...

822
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,167
Maybe You should listen to him, right?

823
00:45:26,292 --> 00:45:28,792
He’s right, stay home.
It’s not too late.

824
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:34,417
There is a school party next three weeks.

825
00:45:34,918 --> 00:45:38,976
I’m saying this now, because I know
you your attitude towards activities,

826
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,083
and someone needs to organize it.

827
00:45:41,209 --> 00:45:42,292
Malinowski...

828
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:44,834
What I’ve just said?

829
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:47,584
Malinowski!

830
00:45:48,209 --> 00:45:50,626
That you want to organize it?

831
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:54,042
We have a birth of a comedian here.

832
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:58,626
Does anyone have ideas for decorations?

833
00:45:58,792 --> 00:45:59,918
I do!

834
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,209
I have balloons and confetti.

835
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,000
And Purzycki has a party light!

836
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,584
Miss, she’s lying!

837
00:46:21,375 --> 00:46:22,375
Hi.

838
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:26,375
Sorry, Beetle.

839
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,626
How’s school? How’s class?

840
00:46:29,542 --> 00:46:31,709
It’s good that you’re here.

841
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:12,125
Alright...

842
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:14,500
How about “Police Academy” now?

843
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:16,709
No, son. It’s time to go.

844
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,292
But where? You can’t go.

845
00:47:18,709 --> 00:47:20,584
Where?
I have a show on air, I have to go.

846
00:47:20,834 --> 00:47:22,667
You can’t, call in sick.

847
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:25,125
Besides, mom locked us in.

848
00:47:25,709 --> 00:47:26,709
You’re kidding.

849
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:27,792
Where are the keys?

850
00:47:27,834 --> 00:47:29,375
You think I’ve forgotten?

851
00:47:29,542 --> 00:47:31,125
You must take the Anticol.

852
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:34,125
Call Uszpański and just make an appointment.

853
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:35,375
Do it for me.

854
00:47:35,459 --> 00:47:36,459
What?

855
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,918
Make an appointment with Uszpański.

856
00:47:39,292 --> 00:47:40,351
What are you talking about?

857
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:41,709
About disulfiram implant!

858
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:43,918
You wanted me to work in a radio.

859
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:45,042
Yes?!

860
00:47:45,125 --> 00:47:47,751
And now I’m supposed to miss my show?

861
00:47:47,876 --> 00:47:51,125
Want me to get fired? Ruin everything?

862
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,417
Mom! Dad doesn’t want the implant.

863
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:53,918
Alek...

864
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,626
Implant doesn’t work.

865
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,209
- Just do it.
- You know it works.

866
00:47:57,334 --> 00:48:00,209
It’s all a bunch of lies.

867
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:00,834
Alek...

868
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:04,292
They can’t make something
that kills people.

869
00:48:04,459 --> 00:48:06,209
You just feel ill, puke, and stuff.

870
00:48:06,334 --> 00:48:08,292
But it’s not like you die.

871
00:48:08,417 --> 00:48:11,768
You can take an implant yourselves
and shove it up your asses!

872
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:12,959
But...

873
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:21,209
It’s hard to pick just one song
for my son,

874
00:48:21,667 --> 00:48:24,292
so I thought about my own father.

875
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:26,500
And I thought

876
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:30,727
what song could he have played me
to teach me about adult life?

877
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:34,334
What lies inside us?

878
00:48:34,459 --> 00:48:37,000
I think he’s had a beer.

879
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:45,500
Hello, Mrs. Słabiak.

880
00:48:45,584 --> 00:48:47,626
Is Daniel home? Can he go out?

881
00:48:47,751 --> 00:48:50,918
Daniel doesn’t want to
play with you anymore.

882
00:48:59,959 --> 00:49:02,626
Hello. Is Moskit home?

883
00:49:03,834 --> 00:49:05,834
Who is Moskit?

884
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:08,918
Your son, Rajmund.

885
00:49:16,584 --> 00:49:19,042
I don’t think our estate
holds much promise.

886
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:21,042
It’s dangerous.

887
00:49:21,167 --> 00:49:22,918
I’d rather learn programming.

888
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:26,500
You should too. Less outdoors,
more focus on your passion.

889
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:28,375
But I like being outside.

890
00:49:32,375 --> 00:49:34,667
How long does it take?

891
00:49:36,167 --> 00:49:37,417
About twenty revs.

892
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:40,584
If you want, you can check out
the LEGO collection.

893
00:49:45,709 --> 00:49:46,709
Are you mad?

894
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:47,976
It’s my dad’s!

895
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,209
It’s locked.

896
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:51,792
Sometimes, when I behave, he opens it.

897
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:53,751
But I’m scared to play with it anyway.

898
00:49:53,918 --> 00:49:56,334
If anything breaks, it’d be my fault.

899
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,792
Okay...

900
00:50:01,417 --> 00:50:03,209
Don’t touch it, or it won’t load!

901
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,167
It’s a very sensitive device.

902
00:50:05,375 --> 00:50:09,042
Sometimes it doesn’t load
even if I don’t touch anything.

903
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:10,751
Alright...

904
00:50:18,959 --> 00:50:20,250
Does it work?

905
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:23,542
Wait... I’ll check.

906
00:50:30,834 --> 00:50:33,542
So, can I go first?

907
00:50:33,626 --> 00:50:35,506
You’re probably bored with
it playing every day.

908
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:38,334
I’ll show you how to play,
then it’ll be your turn, ok?

909
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:39,626
Ok.

910
00:50:58,459 --> 00:50:59,918
Down it pours!

911
00:51:00,876 --> 00:51:02,500
Aim for the head!

912
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:07,000
It’s just a pisshead.

913
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,292
No.

914
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,083
- Come on, open!
- No!

915
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:30,709
Aluś...

916
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:32,626
You’re home.

917
00:51:33,584 --> 00:51:34,584
Alek!

918
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:42,709
Our sincerest apologies, madam.

919
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:45,584
Do you want us to take him
to the bedroom?

920
00:51:45,709 --> 00:51:48,792
No. Leave him here, on the floor.

921
00:51:52,584 --> 00:51:54,083
- We’re sorry.
- Goodnight.

922
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:56,792
We’re very sorry, goodnight.

923
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:16,834
Thank you.

924
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:53,393
I saw it on my way home.

925
00:52:53,417 --> 00:52:54,626
I’ll show you.

926
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,751
It seemed strange to me
that he went inside,

927
00:52:57,876 --> 00:53:00,459
so I decided to get You

928
00:53:00,626 --> 00:53:03,000
but there was no one home.

929
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:05,334
I didn’t want to be mean.

930
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:08,959
Just thought
You should know where he was.

931
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:10,268
Help me.

932
00:53:10,292 --> 00:53:11,292
How?

933
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:20,751
He’s too heavy.

934
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,959
At least take his wallet.

935
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:31,042
I thought he’d never drink again.

936
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:38,334
Don’t tell anyone, okay?

937
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:39,167
Tomek,

938
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:41,959
everyone knows anyway.

939
00:54:17,334 --> 00:54:18,334
Mom...

940
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:19,834
Yes?

941
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:28,542
Dad just peed himself.

942
00:54:32,626 --> 00:54:34,125
It’s time.

943
00:55:12,751 --> 00:55:14,709
May I sleep in your room tonight?

944
00:55:15,042 --> 00:55:16,042
Mhm.

945
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:20,042
I’ll take the futon,
you take the wall unit.

946
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:21,834
Alright.

947
00:55:25,042 --> 00:55:25,709
Need help?

948
00:55:25,792 --> 00:55:27,459
Yes, pull out the stand.

949
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:43,709
So, what now?

950
00:55:46,542 --> 00:55:49,959
Difficult to say,
we haven’t done it for ages.

951
00:55:54,876 --> 00:55:57,292
You were still little.

952
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,667
I was 10.

953
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:01,500
I remember everything.

954
00:56:03,125 --> 00:56:05,918
How long will this money last for?

955
00:56:07,542 --> 00:56:10,167
I’m still working at the theatre,
we’ll manage, but...

956
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,167
We should say good bye
to the radio though.

957
00:56:15,125 --> 00:56:17,626
I don’t know how much money dad has.

958
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:21,167
I think he sank all into those bags.

959
00:56:22,918 --> 00:56:25,042
We have to set
treatment facility up over here.

960
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,709
Treatment facility?

961
00:56:26,834 --> 00:56:29,959
Yes. And that takes money.

962
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:55,918
Ten bottles of vodka,
four cartons of cigarettes.

963
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,459
I’ll double bag it, so it holds.

964
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:13,876
Hello.

965
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,500
Hello.

966
00:57:19,667 --> 00:57:21,959
Someone pissed in the elevator again.

967
00:57:22,083 --> 00:57:23,792
ylt’s unbearable.

968
00:57:25,709 --> 00:57:27,518
It’s Holenderowa’s dog.

969
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:29,584
He always pisses here.

970
00:57:31,334 --> 00:57:33,751
And how’s your daddy?

971
00:57:54,918 --> 00:57:57,584
Mrs. Słabiak saw me.

972
00:57:57,876 --> 00:57:59,435
Don’t worry about it.

973
00:57:59,459 --> 00:58:00,626
No?

974
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:03,876
Those bags’ve just arrived.

975
00:58:04,584 --> 00:58:07,334
Take his keys, lock all the doors.

976
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,375
And we’ll ration alcohol to him.

977
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:10,709
How?

978
00:58:10,959 --> 00:58:14,959
He gets a bottle, drinks it, goes to sleep,
and then another one waits.

979
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:18,125
At least he’ll be home
and won’t get hurt.

980
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,000
We were better off without him.

981
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:32,101
Every boy should have a father.

982
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:33,792
One day you’ll understand.

983
00:58:33,959 --> 00:58:37,918
Daniel and Moskit
don’t have one and they're fine.

984
00:58:38,375 --> 00:58:42,667
But dad is sick.
You have to treat this as an illness.

985
00:58:43,125 --> 00:58:46,000
He just as well might have had
a heart attack or a stroke.

986
00:58:46,417 --> 00:58:50,417
Sick people don’t pee themselves,
and they’re nice.

987
00:58:51,042 --> 00:58:54,125
They do, and they’re not.
You’d be surprised.

988
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,125
Turn off the light.

989
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,042
And be quiet.

990
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,500
Helena!

991
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,125
Go.

992
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:24,584
No.

993
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,918
Helena!

994
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:41,626
Tomek! Tomek! Tomek!

995
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:45,083
Tomek! Tomek! Tomek! Tomek!

996
00:59:45,209 --> 00:59:46,792
Tomek!

997
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,751
Go.

998
01:00:07,834 --> 01:00:09,500
Yes, daddy?

999
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,417
I was calling you, where were you?

1000
01:00:12,584 --> 01:00:13,792
I didn’t hear.

1001
01:00:13,876 --> 01:00:18,209
“I didn’t hear, I didn’t hear.”

1002
01:00:18,709 --> 01:00:20,250
“I didn’t hear.”

1003
01:00:20,584 --> 01:00:23,292
What even is that voice?

1004
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:30,000
When I go “Tomek, Tomek, TOMEK!”,

1005
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:34,334
then you’re supposed to come, got it?

1006
01:00:35,751 --> 01:00:37,751
Now help me up.

1007
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,584
Alright, but be quiet.

1008
01:00:41,667 --> 01:00:43,626
See? Slowly, slowly.

1009
01:00:44,918 --> 01:00:47,918
Jesus. This floor is fucking slippery.

1010
01:00:53,042 --> 01:00:54,042
Alright.

1011
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:55,709
Come, let’s walk over here.

1012
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:02,209
Dad...

1013
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,459
Give me your hand.

1014
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:11,834
For fuck’s sake!

1015
01:01:12,542 --> 01:01:13,918
What is this?!

1016
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:21,959
You know what? Let’s just crawl.

1017
01:01:22,209 --> 01:01:23,209
Slowly.

1018
01:01:23,459 --> 01:01:26,334
It’s too fucking slippery
to get up here.

1019
01:01:27,042 --> 01:01:29,250
See? We’ll just get up here.

1020
01:01:29,667 --> 01:01:30,667
There.

1021
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:32,667
Alright.

1022
01:01:34,626 --> 01:01:36,209
That fucking thing...

1023
01:01:36,751 --> 01:01:39,334
Easy does it. Come on.

1024
01:01:44,959 --> 01:01:46,000
Here.

1025
01:01:54,626 --> 01:01:55,792
Tomek...

1026
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,959
Yes, daddy?

1027
01:02:02,209 --> 01:02:03,667
Turn off the light.

1028
01:02:13,417 --> 01:02:15,459
Come here, come to me. Come.

1029
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,209
Your mom...

1030
01:02:26,834 --> 01:02:29,792
She’s a beautiful woman,
you know that, right?

1031
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,959
The most beautiful woman in the world.

1032
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,667
Exactly.

1033
01:02:35,834 --> 01:02:38,959
The most beautiful.

1034
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:43,876
Listen...

1035
01:02:44,083 --> 01:02:46,417
When I was...

1036
01:02:46,876 --> 01:02:50,042
When I was abroad,

1037
01:02:52,626 --> 01:02:55,042
there was this guy

1038
01:02:55,209 --> 01:02:58,751
hanging around here, Mirek.

1039
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:03,125
It’s important. You’re a big boy now.

1040
01:03:03,334 --> 01:03:05,292
Did you ever see him around the house?

1041
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:07,918
There was no one here.

1042
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,626
Don’t lie to me.

1043
01:03:09,918 --> 01:03:11,083
I’m not lying.

1044
01:03:11,209 --> 01:03:12,292
“I’m not lying.”

1045
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,709
“I’m not lying, I’m not lying.”

1046
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,918
Peep, peep, what is that fucking voice?

1047
01:03:19,751 --> 01:03:21,626
Are you a man or a woman?

1048
01:03:21,876 --> 01:03:24,959
“I’m not lying, I’m not lying.”

1049
01:03:25,167 --> 01:03:26,292
I’m not lying.

1050
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:27,459
There!

1051
01:03:27,918 --> 01:03:29,626
That’s better.

1052
01:03:33,334 --> 01:03:34,626
Is she here?

1053
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,167
Who?

1054
01:03:47,459 --> 01:03:48,876
That mop.

1055
01:03:49,042 --> 01:03:50,709
The puppet.

1056
01:03:51,667 --> 01:03:54,375
Your mother. Is she here?

1057
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:58,876
That’s good, because...

1058
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:01,751
soon all the...

1059
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:04,125
puppets,

1060
01:04:04,834 --> 01:04:06,042
and...

1061
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:07,834
the puppeteers and...

1062
01:04:08,083 --> 01:04:09,310
whores

1063
01:04:09,334 --> 01:04:11,334
from the puppet theatre...

1064
01:04:11,834 --> 01:04:12,918
They have to pass away.

1065
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,417
It’s important.

1066
01:04:16,918 --> 01:04:19,375
The whores have to pass away.

1067
01:04:22,542 --> 01:04:24,626
Repeat after me.

1068
01:04:27,792 --> 01:04:28,876
Reapeat it.

1069
01:04:30,083 --> 01:04:32,542
- The whores have to pass away.
- Right.

1070
01:05:03,709 --> 01:05:05,626
Kulewska, I see you.

1071
01:05:23,876 --> 01:05:24,876
Tomek...

1072
01:05:25,042 --> 01:05:26,167
Write it down.

1073
01:05:27,626 --> 01:05:29,292
internal:

1074
01:05:34,542 --> 01:05:36,083
fallopian tubes,

1075
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,918
ovaries,

1076
01:05:44,125 --> 01:05:45,834
uterus,

1077
01:05:49,626 --> 01:05:51,542
vagina.

1078
01:05:52,751 --> 01:05:55,500
Tarnowski! Come here, son.

1079
01:05:55,709 --> 01:05:58,417
I didn’t expect that from you.

1080
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:05,560
You come from an intelligent family,

1081
01:06:05,584 --> 01:06:07,042
you’re bright,

1082
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:09,459
but something...

1083
01:06:09,626 --> 01:06:12,167
something’s going on here, Malinowski.

1084
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,626
Nothing’s going on, miss.

1085
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:16,459
You can tell me.

1086
01:06:16,542 --> 01:06:18,584
I’m watching you.

1087
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:22,042
That’s my job - to see and hear things.

1088
01:06:22,209 --> 01:06:23,751
Math:

1089
01:06:23,876 --> 01:06:24,876
F.

1090
01:06:25,834 --> 01:06:26,834
Physics:

1091
01:06:26,876 --> 01:06:27,918
F.

1092
01:06:27,959 --> 01:06:29,250
Biology:

1093
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:30,751
Two F’s.

1094
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,459
Oh, another F here.

1095
01:06:34,209 --> 01:06:36,976
You don’t pay attention.
You are sleeping during classes.

1096
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,751
Why did you sleep last time?

1097
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,334
You really want to know?

1098
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:45,918
I don’t want to.

1099
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:48,417
I have to know it, Malinowski.

1100
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:54,125
Why do you hate Malicka so much?

1101
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:55,959
What has she done?

1102
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:58,334
That’s a private matter

1103
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,083
between me and Malicka.

1104
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,292
And what you’re asking me
is my private matter!

1105
01:07:04,334 --> 01:07:05,435
I’ll tell you, and then what?

1106
01:07:05,459 --> 01:07:06,542
Are you going to help me?

1107
01:07:06,667 --> 01:07:09,417
No! You’ll keep giving me F’s.

1108
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,709
I’d never tell you anything.

1109
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:14,792
You’re the worst teacher I’ve ever known.

1110
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:18,959
You should quit this job and leave.

1111
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:20,500
Leave?

1112
01:07:20,709 --> 01:07:22,167
Why should I?

1113
01:07:22,834 --> 01:07:24,834
Because whores have to pass away.

1114
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:34,626
Here you go.

1115
01:07:39,167 --> 01:07:41,542
Is that how this Dave Gahan looks like?

1116
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:43,083
I don’t know.

1117
01:07:43,417 --> 01:07:44,751
I think so.

1118
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:48,542
You’re quite a man now.

1119
01:07:50,792 --> 01:07:51,394
No!

1120
01:07:51,418 --> 01:07:52,876
- My little boy!
- Stop it!

1121
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,667
- Such a little boy!
- Stop it!

1122
01:07:55,834 --> 01:07:57,042
Mom...

1123
01:08:27,751 --> 01:08:28,751
Hi...

1124
01:08:30,334 --> 01:08:31,602
You look beautiful.

1125
01:08:31,626 --> 01:08:32,792
Thanks.

1126
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:38,000
May I dance with You?

1127
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,709
Let’s get out of here.

1128
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,292
What has happened here?

1129
01:09:51,334 --> 01:09:54,834
People from the radio came.
He stopped showing up.

1130
01:09:55,292 --> 01:09:57,459
They fired him?

1131
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,626
They saw him in this condition.

1132
01:10:01,209 --> 01:10:03,209
Did they fire him?

1133
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,959
I think so.

1134
01:10:05,125 --> 01:10:07,834
Thankfully I still have a job.

1135
01:10:31,292 --> 01:10:35,500
He got mad at them and broke the window.

1136
01:10:47,751 --> 01:10:51,918
I tried to calm him down, but he said...

1137
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:57,876
He called me a puppet and would kill me.

1138
01:10:59,083 --> 01:11:02,959
I can’t take this anymore.
I really can’t.

1139
01:11:05,334 --> 01:11:09,042
I should take you far away.

1140
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:13,834
I’m a bad mother. I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.

1141
01:11:13,918 --> 01:11:16,185
You’re not a bad mother.

1142
01:11:16,209 --> 01:11:19,584
You’re the best mom in the world.

1143
01:11:20,626 --> 01:11:22,042
We’ll manage.

1144
01:11:22,334 --> 01:11:22,876
Give me!

1145
01:11:23,042 --> 01:11:24,042
Give me!

1146
01:11:24,417 --> 01:11:25,626
I know you have it.

1147
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,918
I don’t!!!

1148
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,709
We’re out until the end of the month,
you must go to grandma.

1149
01:11:46,876 --> 01:11:48,918
I’m not going anywhere.

1150
01:11:50,125 --> 01:11:53,459
I don’t have any more,
do you understand?

1151
01:11:55,709 --> 01:12:01,584
I wanted to borrow from Mrs. Janeczka,
but she said dad... already did.

1152
01:12:03,709 --> 01:12:06,709
They know at the theatre, too.
I’m so ashamed.

1153
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:10,542
I’m ashamed to ask anyone.

1154
01:12:19,876 --> 01:12:21,792
This is for you.

1155
01:12:22,042 --> 01:12:23,019
But...

1156
01:12:23,043 --> 01:12:25,709
What do you mean?
They’re great bags.

1157
01:12:25,834 --> 01:12:27,918
I have more, so if...

1158
01:12:28,417 --> 01:12:30,185
anyone would like to buy one...

1159
01:12:30,209 --> 01:12:31,250
cheap...

1160
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:32,834
How cheap?

1161
01:12:33,751 --> 01:12:35,626
You decide.

1162
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:39,709
Okay, thanks.

1163
01:12:48,292 --> 01:12:49,685
I must talk to you in private!

1164
01:12:49,709 --> 01:12:50,709
We are in private.

1165
01:12:50,834 --> 01:12:51,667
There is an issue.

1166
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:54,334
This is what you say
when there’s an issue.

1167
01:12:55,209 --> 01:12:58,250
They were like this when I came.

1168
01:12:58,626 --> 01:13:02,626
When her geezer comes back,
he’ll go ballistic.

1169
01:13:02,959 --> 01:13:05,459
You have to take him.
I’m not kidding. ASAP!

1170
01:13:05,542 --> 01:13:08,125
For their both sake.

1171
01:13:09,167 --> 01:13:10,792
Can you lend me your skateboard?

1172
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:11,918
Yes.

1173
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,542
Hello, Mr. Pussy.

1174
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:30,667
Finally got you, you punk.

1175
01:13:31,918 --> 01:13:34,334
I’m sorry, I didn’t mean...

1176
01:13:34,834 --> 01:13:36,500
Is this your father?

1177
01:13:38,626 --> 01:13:41,042
You live on the 8th floor, right?

1178
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:43,000
What’s this?

1179
01:13:44,292 --> 01:13:46,334
Dad doesn’t want
to burn the house down.

1180
01:13:46,417 --> 01:13:48,292
So he smokes over his chest.

1181
01:13:48,959 --> 01:13:50,334
Ah.

1182
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:56,125
How can you run your place this way?

1183
01:13:56,918 --> 01:13:58,876
Where’s your mother in all this?

1184
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,876
She says this is the best solution.

1185
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:03,709
So she’s no better.

1186
01:14:03,876 --> 01:14:05,125
And you are?

1187
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:06,584
A KGB spy.

1188
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:08,792
So you’re well-informed.

1189
01:14:11,292 --> 01:14:13,876
Do you know what they say about you?

1190
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:16,417
Pisshead son.

1191
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:18,459
They’re not saying that.

1192
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:19,709
Are You sure?

1193
01:14:21,876 --> 01:14:24,393
Remember, you don’t owe anyone anything.

1194
01:14:24,417 --> 01:14:25,584
Got it?

1195
01:14:30,417 --> 01:14:32,459
My father hit the booze too.

1196
01:14:32,959 --> 01:14:34,709
Even worse than yours.

1197
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:35,792
All the time.

1198
01:14:35,876 --> 01:14:37,834
My dad doesn’t drink all the time.

1199
01:14:38,125 --> 01:14:39,667
Only sometimes.

1200
01:14:39,876 --> 01:14:42,626
Then he stops and he’s normal again.

1201
01:14:42,792 --> 01:14:44,959
How can you even call this thing
a father?

1202
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:46,626
Look at this.

1203
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:49,626
All what was
good is burned away by alcohol.

1204
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,918
Do you have trash bags?

1205
01:15:02,292 --> 01:15:06,334
These bottles
must be worth something at least.

1206
01:15:07,292 --> 01:15:08,292
Oh!

1207
01:15:08,584 --> 01:15:10,459
This is yours, right?

1208
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:17,250
The man in that room
isn’t your father anymore.

1209
01:15:17,459 --> 01:15:20,375
He doesn’t even know you exist.

1210
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:26,083
Your father doesn’t love you,
do you get it yet?

1211
01:15:26,417 --> 01:15:29,209
What, you thought he’d stop drinking?

1212
01:15:29,417 --> 01:15:31,250
He’s lost. It’s over.

1213
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:35,584
Sooner You understand,
easier your life will be.

1214
01:15:36,542 --> 01:15:40,250
I’m sorry son,
I’m afraid there’s nothing You can do.

1215
01:15:51,417 --> 01:15:53,918
I’m recording now.
I’m recording.

1216
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:56,792
Hi, Beetle!

1217
01:15:57,167 --> 01:15:58,334
Look!

1218
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:02,918
Everything’s so big here in America.
Even cars.

1219
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:06,709
I hope you visit me soon.
With mommy.

1220
01:16:07,125 --> 01:16:08,918
You’ll see with Your own eyes.

1221
01:16:10,709 --> 01:16:11,918
I’ve finished recording.

1222
01:16:13,417 --> 01:16:14,918
This is our elevator.

1223
01:16:15,167 --> 01:16:17,500
We call it “Windows”.

1224
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:21,083
And it will take us to the 45th floor.

1225
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:23,792
Fucking bith has just arrived.

1226
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:28,209
Stinks of shit here.

1227
01:16:30,751 --> 01:16:31,751
Move away dude.

1228
01:16:31,876 --> 01:16:33,584
Aluś, show me the mop!

1229
01:16:34,042 --> 01:16:35,334
Get the fuck out of here.

1230
01:16:35,709 --> 01:16:36,125
Move.

1231
01:16:36,334 --> 01:16:37,626
Come on, show me...

1232
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:39,918
“Return to Nowhere”.

1233
01:16:42,167 --> 01:16:43,709
“Return to Nowhere”.

1234
01:16:46,626 --> 01:16:50,876
I go back through the smoldering embers
of the past

1235
01:16:51,834 --> 01:16:58,125
Memories benightedly jutted out

1236
01:17:00,042 --> 01:17:02,751
Stripped of the silk

1237
01:17:03,417 --> 01:17:08,918
Through the flames of time,
the stumps of those years...

1238
01:17:11,167 --> 01:17:13,709
What are You heading for?

1239
01:17:13,918 --> 01:17:14,959
What are you doing?

1240
01:17:15,250 --> 01:17:16,059
Leave it alone!

1241
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:16,500
Tomek...

1242
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
No! Leave it alone!

1243
01:17:18,042 --> 01:17:20,584
I must take it to the repair shop.

1244
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:21,709
The what...? No!

1245
01:17:22,334 --> 01:17:23,334
Leave it alone.

1246
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:24,792
Leave it alone!

1247
01:17:24,834 --> 01:17:26,334
- It’s working!
- Tomek!

1248
01:17:26,459 --> 01:17:28,459
- No, the head needs cleaning.
- Leave it, dad!

1249
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:29,626
Dad, leave it...

1250
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:32,500
Tomuś, I’m asking nicely!

1251
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:33,751
Give it back!

1252
01:17:34,626 --> 01:17:38,542
You’re a liar!
There was NO radio!

1253
01:17:44,626 --> 01:17:48,292
What do you mean Juskowiak?
I’m talking about Dejna!

1254
01:17:48,417 --> 01:17:49,834
Oh, Tomuś!

1255
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:52,250
Beetle!

1256
01:18:00,834 --> 01:18:02,626
Clean.

1257
01:18:11,500 --> 01:18:12,602
Give that back!

1258
01:18:12,626 --> 01:18:13,667
You little twerp!

1259
01:18:13,751 --> 01:18:14,644
Leave him alone!

1260
01:18:14,668 --> 01:18:16,393
- Leave him alone!
- This is none of your business!

1261
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:18,351
He has stolen my VCR!

1262
01:18:18,375 --> 01:18:20,209
Lies.

1263
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:25,918
Tomuś...

1264
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,083
Beetle!

1265
01:18:34,292 --> 01:18:35,643
Quipster.

1266
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:39,709
Could you help me out neighbor?
Just a couple of zlotys.

1267
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:41,685
Go away.

1268
01:18:41,709 --> 01:18:43,209
Pardon me then.

1269
01:18:52,125 --> 01:18:52,792
Hello.

1270
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:54,792
Hello, Szafarowicz.

1271
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:04,667
We need more red bags for tomorrow.
Have You got any?

1272
01:19:04,792 --> 01:19:05,918
- Yeah.
- Great.

1273
01:19:07,209 --> 01:19:08,417
Here.

1274
01:19:16,876 --> 01:19:21,626
Tomek, thanks a milion.
It’s a pleasure doing business with You.

1275
01:19:23,918 --> 01:19:26,209
When will I be able to come
to your place?

1276
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:28,626
Soon, I promise.

1277
01:19:29,626 --> 01:19:32,417
You said you’ll play something
on the piano. You promised.

1278
01:19:32,626 --> 01:19:35,125
I’m going to keep that promise.

1279
01:19:46,959 --> 01:19:49,876
What are you doing here, mom?

1280
01:19:52,959 --> 01:19:55,959
Tanning, relaxing.

1281
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,167
Tomorrow is the first day
of summer break.

1282
01:20:01,751 --> 01:20:04,083
Are you happy?

1283
01:20:12,626 --> 01:20:15,834
For the bags.
That is your lot.

1284
01:20:15,959 --> 01:20:18,000
That’s a lot of money.

1285
01:20:21,626 --> 01:20:24,500
You’ll be able to go to grandma’s.
You’ll get a rest.

1286
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:26,918
What about you?

1287
01:20:27,167 --> 01:20:32,042
Mrs. Janeczka is going on holiday,
she asked me to look after her dog.

1288
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:35,417
I’ll join you when she gets back.

1289
01:20:36,042 --> 01:20:37,542
And dad?

1290
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:41,167
Hard to say.

1291
01:20:41,792 --> 01:20:45,083
Maybe he’ll get better by then,
and we’ll come together?

1292
01:20:46,751 --> 01:20:49,792
There is a chance to help him yet?

1293
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:52,709
There is. Always is.

1294
01:20:53,209 --> 01:20:58,209
But what good would that do?
If he wants to drink, he won’t stop.

1295
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:02,667
What about Mrs. Ala?

1296
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:05,876
Intravenous therapy lady.

1297
01:21:06,209 --> 01:21:08,876
I’ll talk to her tomorrow.

1298
01:21:09,626 --> 01:21:12,834
But talk to him today.

1299
01:21:18,292 --> 01:21:19,810
Could you do it?

1300
01:21:19,834 --> 01:21:20,918
Please.

1301
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:22,209
No.

1302
01:21:22,292 --> 01:21:24,417
You do it.

1303
01:21:25,375 --> 01:21:26,292
Alright.

1304
01:21:26,334 --> 01:21:28,125
I’ll talk to him when he wakes up.

1305
01:21:28,167 --> 01:21:29,834
Now go to sleep.

1306
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:36,250
Goodnight.

1307
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:37,459
Goodnight.

1308
01:21:43,209 --> 01:21:44,334
You whore!

1309
01:21:44,375 --> 01:21:46,459
- You’re dead!
- Get out of here!

1310
01:21:47,542 --> 01:21:49,667
Fucking village actress!

1311
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,209
No!

1312
01:21:55,459 --> 01:21:57,459
Look what you did to me!

1313
01:21:57,667 --> 01:21:59,250
You fucking slut!

1314
01:21:59,334 --> 01:22:00,667
You’re done! You’re dead!

1315
01:22:00,918 --> 01:22:01,959
Leave her alone!

1316
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Help!

1317
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Help!

1318
01:22:06,167 --> 01:22:07,167
Open up!

1319
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,876
- Help!
- Mom, get back!

1320
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,334
God almighty!

1321
01:22:14,459 --> 01:22:17,125
If I were you,
I’d be ashamed to have a child!

1322
01:22:17,209 --> 01:22:19,042
What the hell are you doing?!

1323
01:22:19,125 --> 01:22:20,102
You should call the cops!

1324
01:22:20,126 --> 01:22:21,167
Take yours home!

1325
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:22,894
- Don’t look! Call the cops!
- Mom, are you crazy?

1326
01:22:22,918 --> 01:22:24,709
Go back home!

1327
01:22:29,709 --> 01:22:30,834
Go to my room.

1328
01:22:30,876 --> 01:22:32,250
He’s going to kill me.

1329
01:22:32,792 --> 01:22:34,417
Go to my room.

1330
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:35,500
I’ll talk to him.

1331
01:22:35,626 --> 01:22:37,042
And put something on, please.

1332
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:39,167
You’ll really talk to him?

1333
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:41,459
You’re bleeding! Are you hurt?

1334
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:42,792
It’s nothing.

1335
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:45,459
But talk to him, alright?

1336
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:48,459
Please, honey. Talk to him.

1337
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:28,334
What’s this?!

1338
01:23:28,792 --> 01:23:30,334
What’s this?

1339
01:23:32,626 --> 01:23:34,584
Leave me alone.

1340
01:23:38,626 --> 01:23:40,417
Fuck...

1341
01:23:42,959 --> 01:23:44,792
Where is that mop?

1342
01:23:44,918 --> 01:23:46,167
Leave her alone.

1343
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:47,626
Where’s that puppet?

1344
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Fuck...

1345
01:24:00,918 --> 01:24:02,792
Tomek, where the knives are?

1346
01:24:03,209 --> 01:24:04,918
There are no knives.

1347
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:07,459
Dad. It’s the middle of the night.

1348
01:24:09,459 --> 01:24:11,667
I have to go to school tomorrow.

1349
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:14,459
Mom has a show.

1350
01:24:14,667 --> 01:24:17,125
There won’t be any show, son.

1351
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,876
Curtain comes down.
Fucking over.

1352
01:24:22,709 --> 01:24:23,876
Fucking...

1353
01:24:23,918 --> 01:24:25,626
village actress.

1354
01:24:32,083 --> 01:24:34,375
I’ll wring her out like a mop.

1355
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:37,876
Today is the mop’s last performance!

1356
01:24:37,959 --> 01:24:39,792
Dad, be quiet, please.

1357
01:24:39,959 --> 01:24:41,626
You’re still young, you know?

1358
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:43,709
You don’t get it yet.

1359
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:44,792
Look.

1360
01:24:44,876 --> 01:24:46,250
See that?

1361
01:24:46,876 --> 01:24:49,375
We’ll be better off without her.

1362
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:53,125
Whores have to pass away.
You watch.

1363
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,876
Don’t say that.

1364
01:25:00,083 --> 01:25:01,751
And stop talking like a woman!

1365
01:25:01,876 --> 01:25:04,959
Dad, please, quiet down.

1366
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:14,083
Did that Mirek come here?

1367
01:25:14,292 --> 01:25:16,417
There was no Mirek.

1368
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:17,584
Don’t you get it?

1369
01:25:17,834 --> 01:25:20,500
We were waiting for you alone.

1370
01:25:20,709 --> 01:25:22,792
Just believe me.

1371
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:24,500
Tomek!

1372
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:27,584
Tomek...

1373
01:25:30,334 --> 01:25:31,792
Go to the mop

1374
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:36,042
and tell her I’m coming to strangle her.

1375
01:25:36,834 --> 01:25:38,584
And then you know what I’ll do?

1376
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:40,876
I’ll climb to that overhead cupboard,

1377
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:43,542
find some rope and hang myself.

1378
01:25:44,375 --> 01:25:45,375
Dad...

1379
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:50,334
Don’t worry, Tomuś.
You I won’t hurt. You I love.

1380
01:25:50,792 --> 01:25:52,542
Don’t be scared.

1381
01:26:00,125 --> 01:26:01,626
Here...

1382
01:26:05,292 --> 01:26:08,918
Have a drink. It will make you stronger.

1383
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:18,000
You’re innocent, you know?

1384
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:21,792
Go to the mop, tell her I’m coming.

1385
01:26:21,959 --> 01:26:25,667
Whores have got to go. Tell her that.

1386
01:26:39,834 --> 01:26:41,626
Is he coming?

1387
01:26:45,959 --> 01:26:47,918
Well?

1388
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:52,584
He said you must go.

1389
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:55,334
Go where?

1390
01:26:55,375 --> 01:26:56,751
Where am I supposed to go?

1391
01:26:56,876 --> 01:26:59,417
Get ready, Helenka!

1392
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:02,000
You little village girl!

1393
01:27:03,959 --> 01:27:05,792
Let’s call the police.

1394
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,542
No, no, no.

1395
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:10,876
Hide me here.

1396
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,959
Here, quickly.

1397
01:27:13,876 --> 01:27:14,876
Hide me.

1398
01:27:15,042 --> 01:27:16,042
I can’t do it.

1399
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:17,626
You can!

1400
01:27:17,792 --> 01:27:19,584
Lift this up.

1401
01:27:22,125 --> 01:27:23,876
You can do it!

1402
01:27:35,125 --> 01:27:36,209
I can’t...

1403
01:27:36,292 --> 01:27:38,584
You can. Push harder!

1404
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:49,500
Harder.

1405
01:28:06,751 --> 01:28:08,584
Ready?!

1406
01:28:10,375 --> 01:28:11,500
Go to bed.

1407
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:13,167
What?

1408
01:28:26,626 --> 01:28:28,083
Where is she?

1409
01:28:28,125 --> 01:28:30,125
She has left.

1410
01:28:30,459 --> 01:28:31,792
Where has she gone?

1411
01:28:31,918 --> 01:28:33,709
I don’t know, she’s just left.

1412
01:28:33,876 --> 01:28:34,918
Get up!

1413
01:28:35,042 --> 01:28:36,375
I know where she is.

1414
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:37,584
Stop it...

1415
01:28:37,667 --> 01:28:40,000
Get up! I know where she is!

1416
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,792
Lift it up.

1417
01:28:50,334 --> 01:28:52,500
She’s not here.
She’s left.

1418
01:28:56,209 --> 01:28:57,584
Are You kidding me?

1419
01:29:07,417 --> 01:29:09,626
The mop is gone!

1420
01:29:09,751 --> 01:29:11,209
But...

1421
01:29:13,959 --> 01:29:15,792
Has he gone?

1422
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:54,417
Have some sleep.

1423
01:30:09,751 --> 01:30:11,417
Mom...

1424
01:30:12,292 --> 01:30:14,417
Yes, honey?

1425
01:30:14,751 --> 01:30:16,626
I love you.

1426
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:37,792
I love you too.

1427
01:30:42,792 --> 01:30:45,417
You’re so big and brave now.

1428
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:51,584
This will end, I promise.

1429
01:30:52,751 --> 01:30:55,792
I’ll clean everything up tomorrow.

1430
01:30:55,959 --> 01:30:59,042
I’ll iron your shirt.

1431
01:31:00,751 --> 01:31:02,626
It’ll be like before, you’ll see.

1432
01:31:02,667 --> 01:31:04,000
Are you sure?

1433
01:31:04,167 --> 01:31:05,709
Yes. I promise.

1434
01:31:10,918 --> 01:31:15,417
Our school, our school

1435
01:31:15,542 --> 01:31:20,000
Absolutely the best and cherished

1436
01:31:20,334 --> 01:31:24,459
Filled with joy and knowledge

1437
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:28,876
Our glorious common cause

1438
01:31:33,918 --> 01:31:35,542
Why?

1439
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:43,083
You didn’t even look at me at assembly.

1440
01:31:43,209 --> 01:31:44,375
I checked.

1441
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:47,959
You promised to play me something.

1442
01:31:48,125 --> 01:31:49,542
I will.

1443
01:31:52,751 --> 01:31:53,918
Tomek?

1444
01:31:54,667 --> 01:31:55,561
Hi.

1445
01:31:55,585 --> 01:31:57,250
This is Marta.

1446
01:31:57,417 --> 01:31:58,334
Hello, ma’am.

1447
01:31:58,417 --> 01:32:01,500
Hello. I’ve heard a lot about you.
Nice to meet you.

1448
01:32:01,918 --> 01:32:05,792
I’ll be right back,
I need to check something.

1449
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:10,417
You probably have
a report with a distinction, right?

1450
01:32:19,918 --> 01:32:21,292
And? Is everything ok?

1451
01:32:21,542 --> 01:32:22,542
Yes.

1452
01:32:22,709 --> 01:32:24,209
Come in.

1453
01:32:25,542 --> 01:32:26,792
She’s beautiful.

1454
01:32:28,250 --> 01:32:32,792
The door to the living room
stays closed. My dad’s sick, so...

1455
01:32:33,083 --> 01:32:35,500
I came to see you, not your dad.

1456
01:32:35,626 --> 01:32:36,876
Alright. So…

1457
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:39,876
I’m just saying...

1458
01:32:39,959 --> 01:32:41,417
I love summer.

1459
01:32:41,792 --> 01:32:45,584
In two days, we’re going to Italy
on holidays.

1460
01:32:45,792 --> 01:32:47,042
Abroad?

1461
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:48,626
Yes. How about you?

1462
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,834
I don’t know.

1463
01:32:51,042 --> 01:32:53,584
Probably going to grandma’s,
or something.

1464
01:32:53,834 --> 01:32:56,042
You have two apartments?

1465
01:32:56,167 --> 01:32:57,417
No...

1466
01:32:57,584 --> 01:33:01,709
Mom is looking after
a neighbor’s apartment.

1467
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:06,000
Oh...

1468
01:33:06,292 --> 01:33:08,042
The glass is missing.

1469
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:11,417
The wind broke it.

1470
01:33:12,876 --> 01:33:15,334
I’ll bring you a beautiful scarf
from Italy.

1471
01:33:15,584 --> 01:33:17,417
It’ll look great here.

1472
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:18,959
Thanks.

1473
01:33:23,626 --> 01:33:25,959
Is that you when you were little?

1474
01:33:26,125 --> 01:33:27,250
Yes.

1475
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:34,167
You collect crystal dishes?

1476
01:33:34,375 --> 01:33:36,292
You could say that...

1477
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:42,125
Who’s this?

1478
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,500
A friend.

1479
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,834
I don’t hang my friends’ photos
on my wall.

1480
01:33:52,667 --> 01:33:54,751
You have so many LEGO blocks.

1481
01:33:54,959 --> 01:33:58,459
Yeah. They relax me.

1482
01:33:58,667 --> 01:34:01,584
You can build...

1483
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,083
all sorts of things.

1484
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,268
I relax with Depeche Mode.

1485
01:34:08,292 --> 01:34:09,292
Sit down.

1486
01:34:11,459 --> 01:34:15,000
Everyone has their own thing, right?

1487
01:34:15,042 --> 01:34:16,042
Yeah...

1488
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:21,584
Have you ever kissed anyone?

1489
01:34:21,709 --> 01:34:23,792
Of course I have.

1490
01:34:51,417 --> 01:34:52,834
What was that?

1491
01:34:53,542 --> 01:34:55,542
Don’t be scared, it’s...

1492
01:34:55,626 --> 01:34:58,417
I told you, my dad is sick.

1493
01:35:37,417 --> 01:35:41,042
You play it so well...

1494
01:35:43,959 --> 01:35:47,959
And then you can add some more,

1495
01:35:48,125 --> 01:35:51,667
but faster, like...

1496
01:35:54,292 --> 01:35:56,751
I see a little girl.

1497
01:35:57,167 --> 01:35:58,542
Dad...

1498
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:01,167
This is Marta.

1499
01:36:02,209 --> 01:36:03,459
Marta...

1500
01:36:03,709 --> 01:36:04,918
This is my dad.

1501
01:36:05,042 --> 01:36:06,959
- I'm Alek.
- Hello.

1502
01:36:07,959 --> 01:36:09,626
Very pretty.

1503
01:36:11,209 --> 01:36:13,500
Close the door.

1504
01:36:14,876 --> 01:36:16,125
I apologize for him.

1505
01:36:16,334 --> 01:36:18,417
- He’s sick.
- I have to go.

1506
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,417
Come here.

1507
01:37:00,959 --> 01:37:03,876
Remember not to say anything to grandma.

1508
01:37:05,042 --> 01:37:06,834
What if she asks?

1509
01:37:07,375 --> 01:37:09,876
Then tell her he doesn’t drink anymore.

1510
01:37:10,083 --> 01:37:13,417
By the time you come back,
everything will be fine.

1511
01:37:15,751 --> 01:37:17,918
Where is my Walkman?

1512
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:20,226
I think it’s in my room.

1513
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:21,417
I’ll go.

1514
01:37:23,042 --> 01:37:24,042
Tomek...

1515
01:37:33,876 --> 01:37:35,125
Dad...

1516
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:43,709
Dad, what are you doing here?

1517
01:38:46,542 --> 01:38:48,542
Come back home.

1518
01:39:00,083 --> 01:39:02,476
I just wanted to tell you that...

1519
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,226
I’m leaving.

1520
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,876
Tomorrow.

1521
01:39:10,167 --> 01:39:11,667
What about school?

1522
01:39:13,709 --> 01:39:15,375
It’s the summer break.

1523
01:39:15,626 --> 01:39:17,167
Oh, summer.

1524
01:39:21,751 --> 01:39:23,250
Come home.

1525
01:39:23,918 --> 01:39:28,167
We’ll call Mrs. Ala with the IV drip.

1526
01:39:41,334 --> 01:39:43,310
“You’ll stop drinking.”

1527
01:39:43,334 --> 01:39:45,810
“Stop drinking,”
that’s all you ever say.

1528
01:39:45,834 --> 01:39:47,768
“Stop drinking

1529
01:39:47,792 --> 01:39:50,375
and things will be alright.”

1530
01:39:52,918 --> 01:39:54,918
For you, maybe.

1531
01:39:56,209 --> 01:39:59,834
Maybe things will be alright for You.

1532
01:40:00,083 --> 01:40:03,125
But not for me.

1533
01:40:05,459 --> 01:40:07,375
Beetle, I always...

1534
01:40:10,584 --> 01:40:13,959
really feel like I want to drink.

1535
01:40:18,876 --> 01:40:23,542
And I crave more and more
when I don’t drink.

1536
01:40:34,042 --> 01:40:35,375
Do it.

1537
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:38,584
What?

1538
01:40:41,959 --> 01:40:43,292
Do it.

1539
01:40:43,876 --> 01:40:47,500
It’ll be our secret.

1540
01:40:51,083 --> 01:40:51,895
Yeah?

1541
01:40:51,919 --> 01:40:53,083
Really?

1542
01:40:54,876 --> 01:40:56,959
No one will know?

1543
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,250
No one.

1544
01:41:01,042 --> 01:41:03,626
You promise?

1545
01:41:07,459 --> 01:41:09,834
I promise.

1546
01:41:12,751 --> 01:41:17,667
Malinowski always keeps his word.

1547
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,959
I was worried.

1548
01:41:49,667 --> 01:41:52,334
Did you talk to him?

1549
01:41:54,167 --> 01:41:57,000
Is he drunk? Where is he?

1550
01:42:00,626 --> 01:42:03,167
Dad has stopped drinking.

1551
01:42:11,918 --> 01:42:14,834
What are You heading for? Heaven?

1552
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:18,417
It’s gone.

1553
01:42:19,542 --> 01:42:24,500
It has died in flames,
along with my childhood.

1554
01:42:32,125 --> 01:42:37,083
To the memory of my father. Beetle.
Aleksander Aksinowicz (1951 - 2017)

In Poland, nearly one million children live in families with alcohol problems.

1556
01:43:32,417 --> 01:43:37,101
Help for addicts and their family members should be sought in addiction treatment centers.
You can find a list of them at www.parpa.pl
