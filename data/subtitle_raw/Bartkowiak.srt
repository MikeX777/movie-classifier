00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,440
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,079
Now!

3
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,039
Good! Good, Tomek!

4
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,799
Go, go, go, go!

5
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,840
And… yeah, keep your hands up.

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,040
Hands up! Yeah.

7
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,439
-Left!
-Hit him!

8
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
-That's it, Tomek!
-Good!

9
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,480
Breathe! That's it!

10
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,640
Listen. Drink? He's getting weaker.

11
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:39,799
Left, left, right, yeah?
And keep the hands up.

12
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:42,159
Tomek. You're better than him. Better!

13
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,200
Okay. Come on, come on. Come on!

14
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:45,920
Go for it, Tomek, go for it!

15
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Bro, you got him. He's done.

16
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,480
Come on!

17
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,879
That's it!

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,599
Tomek! Hands up!

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Left! Tomek, left!

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
Tomek!

21
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,080
Keep your guard up! Tomek!

22
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,039
Tomek! Hands up… Tomek!

23
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,919
Hands up!

24
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,960
Paweł! Stop the fight! Paweł!

25
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,520
Keep your guard up!

26
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,000
Stop it! Stop the fight!

27
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,439
ZAKOPANE, SIX MONTHS LATER

28
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,519
Boss, some guy is causing a ruckus
at the entrance.

29
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,399
Can I treat him to some pepper spray?
Just wanted to ask.

30
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay…

31
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,240
Come on, man, don't you get it? Steppy D!

32
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,079
Steppy D is here! Steppy D! Ya get it?

33
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,240
Steppy D!

34
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,240
Boss!

35
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,360
I never wait in line, jerk-off.

36
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,040
Welcome to Opium. Good evening.

37
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,560
Steppy D.

38
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,360
I hope you have a great time.

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,079
Yeah, so do I.

40
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,879
Jackal, be so kind as to escort
Mr. Steppy D to the VIP section.

41
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,000
That's more like it!
Girls, we're coming in!

42
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:18,800
See, get it? You all stay outside,
we're coming in!

43
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,279
Oh, yeah, one, two, three!

44
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:24,360
Thanks, homie, very good!
That's what I'm talking about!

45
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,279
Please, feel welcome.

46
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,519
It's not wopium, it's Opium!
And we're inside this Opium.

47
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,800
Ah! Like in opium for the masses?

48
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,279
We got trouble in the VIP section.

49
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,560
What's up?

50
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,079
Come, take a look for yourself.

51
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Leave me alone!

52
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,879
What? What's up?

53
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:42,160
Okay, okay, okay.
Two bottles for us, okay?

54
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,800
And come back, doll.

55
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,920
Hey, what's your name?

56
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,279
So are you gonna sit with us?

57
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:49,720
What name do you like?

58
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,199
Don't you get it?

59
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,240
Hey, take it easy!

60
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,319
Hey, buddy!

61
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,319
Buddy!

62
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,319
Jesus! We have our own security, okay?

63
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,600
Listen, move the party to a hotel.

64
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
You're such a limp dick!

65
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:04,600
Come on, dough!

66
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,839
Buy yourself a new personality!
And fuck off.

67
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,399
What are you doing?

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,079
-Chojecki!
-Chojecki! Fuck them up!

69
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,720
Take him away.

70
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,439
What the hell?

71
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,079
Easy. We were just leaving!

72
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,839
Steppy? Steppy?

73
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,519
We're not coming back!
We won't come back here!

74
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:24,319
Hey, guys, take it easy, let's talk,
we can work this out. Come on! Boss!

75
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,319
Hey, listen! This club sucks!
There's no point going in!

76
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,519
Don't wait in the line!
Don't wait in the line!

77
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
It's shit!

78
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,519
We're gonna meet again!
We're gonna meet again! That's it!

79
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,399
Come on, Steppy! Come on!
This is shit, not a club!

80
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:43,600
Steppy, Steppy?

81
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Wake up. You can go back to sleep later.

82
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,120
I heard you roughed up
a celebrity last night.

83
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
What's going on?

84
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,879
You leaving already?

85
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,879
Thanks.

86
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,039
I've got something for you.

87
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,200
Must burn a lot of fuel, right?

88
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,799
Yeah, but it runs well.

89
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,840
Ah… runs well…
At least something runs well.

90
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,600
Coach had one, right?

91
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,919
No. What are you babbling about?
The coach had an old Polonez.

92
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,240
Come on, he had this one.

93
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,639
No way, he had an old Polonez!

94
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,519
I'm pulling your leg!
Of course he had an old Polonez!

95
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,679
For me, it was like a Mustang.

96
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,000
Did he lose a lot?

97
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,639
Coach? On your fight?

98
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,200
More than he had.

99
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,399
He bet with the wrong people.

100
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,399
They came to get what's theirs
and burned down his gym.

101
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
They say he's holed up getting loaded.

102
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,799
Bro, I don't believe you were doped.

103
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,399
The tests showed I was.

104
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,879
Fuck the tests!

105
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,039
What did you come for?

106
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,080
Like really come for.

107
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,159
I said I've got something for you.

108
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,919
In 1974,
Muhammad Ali beat Foreman in them.

109
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,519
You don't say? Beautiful.

110
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,159
But they were made in 1982.

111
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,960
Yeah, but only we know that.

112
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,120
What are you up to?

113
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,200
Come with me.

114
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,639
So not just chitchat about old times.

115
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,759
Come with me. What's keeping you here?

116
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,679
You know, the wolves
will be in a pack together again.

117
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,519
We'll split everything 50-50.
You'll train the bouncers.

118
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,679
Thanks, bro, but no.

119
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:23,720
Why not?

120
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:25,919
'Cause I still got a lot to learn.

121
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Wait.

122
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:30,000
Yeah?

123
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,240
Okay, set it up.

124
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,039
Yes, at 2 p.m.

125
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,480
When I say I'll be there at two,
I'll be there at two.

126
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:38,399
See ya.

127
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,679
What's up?

128
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,759
Club stuff. If you come with me,
you'll find out.

129
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,600
I know nothing
about working in a club. Thanks.

130
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,039
Keep them. And keep training that fist.

131
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,200
I love you, brother.

132
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:00,000
I love you, too, asshole.

133
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,679
Are you coming for All Saints' Day?

134
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,480
Always.

135
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,679
Hi, Mom.

136
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,600
What-- Mom, what happened?

137
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,720
Yes, Auntie.

138
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,559
Thank you. See you on Thursday.

139
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,639
Almost everyone knows.

140
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,159
Mom, do you know
where I can find Dominika?

141
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,600
CITY HALL

142
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,799
Hey, babe.

143
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,320
Such a nice girl walking alone?

144
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,840
Sorry, but you ain't my type.

145
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,039
I'm just giving back the bag.
Please don't hurt me.

146
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,480
Any finder's fee?

147
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,639
Apparently, you're it.

148
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,519
I saw the video.

149
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,240
Don't wait in the line!

150
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,639
It's shit!

151
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,600
Everyone has their five minutes of fame.

152
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,080
More like 26 seconds.

153
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
Why haven't you called all this time?

154
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,559
You must have gotten my messages.

155
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,519
I… I don't have a good answer for that.

156
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,279
Well, how about a bad one?

157
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,759
You found me for a reason, right?

158
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,639
He's hitting back.

159
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:04,120
No way. It's over.

160
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,279
And one…

161
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,200
And…

162
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,480
Man, how did he do that?
Did you see that?!

163
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,960
You beast… Beast!

164
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:24,039
You're getting wasted again?

165
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,919
At least I didn't run away
with my tail between my legs.

166
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,840
Wiktor's dead.

167
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,639
Car accident.

168
00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,200
Pull yourself together.
The funeral is on Thursday.

169
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,680
Just make sure you come sober.

170
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,240
Or don't come at all.

171
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,119
When we were kids,
our parents had a lot to deal with.

172
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,119
Most of all, you and me.

173
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:41,079
And our adventures.

174
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:48,640
Always together.

175
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,319
We could always rely on each other.

176
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:01,400
Maybe I relied on you a little more.

177
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,200
I remember when
I walked onto thin ice on a lake…

178
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,160
like an idiot. You hit me on the neck.

179
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
When I stole comic books
from the old man's shop.

180
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,720
When I drank too much
for the first time. When…

181
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
I could talk for hours.

182
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,720
And now you're with our dad, bro.

183
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,759
I love you, brother.

184
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,599
Hi.

185
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,160
-Elegant.
-Elegant and sober.

186
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,799
Did you have to? Even today?

187
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,559
My little daughter…

188
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,079
Thanks for dropping by,
but you should be going now.

189
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,599
Bartkowiak.
You fit in here really well now.

190
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,440
You ran away.

191
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,160
Did you have to get juiced up
before the fight?

192
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:49,920
So even you buy that?

193
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,200
Even if I had, you shouldn't have
bet your life on one stupid fight.

194
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,839
Watch it, sonny boy.
I ain't too old to kick your ass!

195
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,519
So what are you waiting for?

196
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:17,079
You ain't getting any younger.

197
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:31,000
Tomek! You don't know shit!

198
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:06,039
I lost everything.

199
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,640
Go back to fucking Zakopane!

200
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,799
Ever heard of Sparta?

201
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,000
They had a leader - Lycurgus.

202
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:43,759
To stop corruption and greed,
he ordered the minting of pelanors -

203
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,039
coins made of normal iron,
not precious stone,

204
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,200
like, I don't know, gold or silver.

205
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,720
Pelanors were big and heavy,
but they had no value.

206
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,599
So, you see…

207
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,680
…stealing and hiding a large amount
of pelanors was practically impossible.

208
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:11,400
Blyat'!
I told you the putter is good for nothing.

209
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:32,119
If euros were so heavy, perhaps
you wouldn't have been tempted, Vadim.

210
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,480
Now you're going to build for me.

211
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:56,799
Thank you.

212
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,559
And what about the club?

213
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,240
I'll stay here, take care
of the formalities. And then…

214
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:11,640
You could keep it.

215
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:14,240
Wiktor…

216
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,480
His dream…

217
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,920
He told me not long ago

218
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,440
that all this
should belong to the two of you.

219
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:25,079
Which means now it's yours.

220
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,480
I'll stay here until I sell the club
and then go back home.

221
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,599
I'm sorry, Mom.

222
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:43,519
But remember this is your home.

223
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,519
This is the Woźny Tower,

224
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,039
a project that will soon become

225
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,559
the fastest growing
office center in town.

226
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,119
This venture is going to revive
and invigorate the old district,

227
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,359
which will also give it a new spirit,

228
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,160
new energy and
completely new opportunities.

229
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:18,039
Simply great. It's pure poetry to my ears.

230
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:22,200
And now a few words
from the president of Sanstal,

231
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:26,119
the man who's going to create
our city's second center.

232
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,519
Floor is yours.

233
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:32,240
Gentlemen, the old district

234
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,680
is going to lead our city
on its way to modernity.

235
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,920
We're going to build a conference center--

236
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,519
The area zoning plan has so far protected

237
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:49,240
the district and its monuments
from such developments.

238
00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:57,160
Thank you, Dominika, for mentioning that.

239
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,519
Obviously, we cannot turn our backs
on the past and tradition

240
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,000
when we are making
a step towards the future.

241
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,319
It is necessary to unite them somehow.

242
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,759
Personally, I believe that Woźny Tower

243
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,039
is going to be a perfect example

244
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,480
of how great the connection of the old

245
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,599
with the new can be,
how well it can blend.

246
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,200
Go through the back door! Quick! Quick!

247
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,000
Good morning.

248
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:39,880
Can I get some beef brains, please?

249
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,880
But we don't want to sell this shop.

250
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,279
You understand.

251
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,759
Yeah.

252
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:51,759
Why don't we negotiate?

253
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:53,319
Come here!

254
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Leave him alone!

255
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,119
Get over here. Get over here!

256
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,599
So? Will you get me my beef brains?

257
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,880
Sign it!

258
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,279
Don't get it stained!

259
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:54,880
Yes, hello?

260
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,799
Good morning.
I'd like to talk about the club Ring.

261
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,839
Good morning, but I'm not looking
for any real estate agents.

262
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,279
Dear sir, we would like
to make you an attractive offer.

263
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,319
How much?

264
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,759
We could agree to two million.

265
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,119
But have you even seen it?
It needs a complete overhaul.

266
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,599
Sign the contract on Thursday?

267
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:28,920
Good.

268
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,839
Then… come by the club, please.

269
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,480
Let's say, at 11 a.m.?

270
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,920
Great, so we're meeting on Thursday.

271
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,559
See you then.

272
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:46,319
SOLD

273
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:54,160
SOLD

274
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,519
CARPENTER

275
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,839
Can I help you?

276
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,480
No. No need. Really.

277
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:04,519
No problem.

278
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,160
You're selling it?

279
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,440
What happened?

280
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,839
Ah…

281
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,720
That's none of your business!
It's our problem.

282
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,839
Have a good day.

283
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:41,880
Sign here, please.

284
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,319
Thank you.

285
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:56,039
I thought the buyer
would like to see it first.

286
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,720
So you're from Sanstal?

287
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,440
You are the ones buying my club?

288
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,400
No.

289
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,480
We only provide purchasing services

290
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,359
on behalf of Fieldstar Group Limited.

291
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,119
We are the representative
and general contractor

292
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,319
of construction projects for this client.

293
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:04,799
Anything wrong?

294
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:09,640
What are you doing?

295
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,720
The offer is off the table.

296
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:18,559
Wait a second.
Why don't you think about it calmly?

297
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,079
We're talking about two million here.

298
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:02,440
SURE. TOMORROW.

299
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,599
OKAY, WILL DO.

300
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
ON MY WAY.

301
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,279
BE THERE IN 15.

302
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:11,359
CLIENT

303
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,039
If Kołodziejczyk doesn't close in a week,
we'll need to take care of it. Him, too.

304
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:40,039
Your friend doesn't want to sell.

305
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:52,119
Dialogue, Repeć.

306
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,440
Talk to him first.

307
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:08,960
Then we might move on to other measures.

308
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,480
I'm going to keep Wiktor's club.

309
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
What happened now?

310
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,839
I've got to find out why
they want to buy everything around here.

311
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:38,519
-What?
-They want to put office blocks there.

312
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,200
Well, they won't put them there for now.

313
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Tomek?

314
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,920
You were the one trying to convince me.

315
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,319
But this is not about the club.

316
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,880
I don't know some of you well yet,

317
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,360
but I hope that's going to change soon.

318
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,599
This is Dominika.

319
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,760
She's going to help me
manage the place for a while.

320
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,440
If there are any questions
for me or Dominika, feel free to ask.

321
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,239
Something funny?

322
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,519
Today, I'm just going to be watching,
so, please, just work as usual.

323
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:39,079
Okay. We're opening in 45 minutes,
so let's get to work.

324
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,760
So what do you think?

325
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,039
Great! Plenty of customers.

326
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,519
We gotta talk.

327
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:16,760
So talk.

328
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,559
It's your last day working here.

329
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,039
And yours, too.

330
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,519
Don't be such a prude.
You want in on the action?

331
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,440
Scram.

332
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,679
I need to find new employees.

333
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,360
I'm going to call Zakopane.

334
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,440
I know the right person.

335
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,679
Maybe give him a chance?

336
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,000
Come on.

337
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,239
Start, please.

338
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,719
Need a ride?

339
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
Actually, why have we never…

340
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,400
Your father would have killed me.

341
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,559
That was the only thing stopping you?

342
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,320
Such a tough guy, but afraid of my father.

343
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,840
Of the coach.

344
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,480
Well trained in the martial arts.

345
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,920
I have an invitation from my boss
to the theater tomorrow.

346
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,199
Why theater all of a sudden?

347
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:50,199
It's a cover to meet with people
he does business with.

348
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,239
Pick me up at six.

349
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
Okay.

350
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,639
Who's that guy?

351
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,719
It's my boss.

352
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,159
And the guy who wants to buy the club.

353
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,440
And the one with the phone?

354
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,360
No idea.

355
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,199
Irek has a lot of, let's say,
business contacts.

356
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,519
I'll be right back.

357
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,159
I hope you understand
the gravity of the situation.

358
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,880
I'm not supposed to be here.

359
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,840
Do you think I'm enjoying myself?

360
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,960
We're having some complications.
Minor ones.

361
00:40:41,719 --> 00:40:42,960
Have I ever let you down?

362
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:45,000
No, you haven't.

363
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:51,199
That's why we're talking.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be.

364
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,119
Appreciate that.

365
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,639
I do.

366
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,719
Seven days left.

367
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:07,039
In seven days, all that
must formally belong to Fieldstar.

368
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,719
Or some pretty important people
will be pissed off.

369
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
And we don't want
them to be pissed off, do we?

370
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:18,159
We'll cover it up in the media
with protests.

371
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:21,199
You will have plenty of free rein
to take action.

372
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,840
-Everything will be ready in time.
-Well, I hope so.

373
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,559
'Cause what you're doing
is more important than it seems.

374
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,880
As I said,
everything will be ready in time.

375
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,280
I have a splendid loge for us.
And a bottle of good wine.

376
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,840
You know, it's forbidden here.
But not for us.

377
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:07,039
And after the show,
I'm taking you out to a reception.

378
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,039
This famous actress is going to be there,

379
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:11,719
only I just forgot her name.

380
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,039
Irek. Please meet Tomek.

381
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,079
Hi.

382
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,679
Hard to believe I failed to notice you.

383
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,079
Ireneusz Parzych. My boss.

384
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,159
Well, then…

385
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,559
Yeah, my friends are waiting for me.

386
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:36,599
So… I should just say
I hope you have a great time.

387
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:37,920
Thank you.

388
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,159
Hi, gentlemen.

389
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,519
Bruised, as usual?

390
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,039
You know me.

391
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:55,960
Boss!

392
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:57,039
Hi!

393
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,960
And this is Dominika.
Jackal and Highlander.

394
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,559
Thanks for agreeing to help.

395
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,320
Are we expecting trouble?

396
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,559
It's more like we might be the trouble.
So keep an eye on everything here.

397
00:43:14,639 --> 00:43:18,280
We're planning to install CCTV
and record audio after hours.

398
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,079
Questions?

399
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,519
Great, follow me.
I'll show you around.

400
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:56,719
Oh! Tommy!

401
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,840
What do you want?

402
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,639
Just taking a look.
I heard the place is cool.

403
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,440
Wanted to see how you're getting on.

404
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,840
I heard about your brother.
My condolences.

405
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,760
And you know what,
I also came to give you advice.

406
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:29,440
Tell me,
why the fuck do you need this place?

407
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:32,920
Haven't you had enough problems?

408
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,360
Yeah!

409
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,920
Time to go.

410
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,119
Tear this place apart.

411
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:55,039
Hey!

412
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,239
My beer! Bartender!

413
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,039
I want a free drink!
Somebody spilled mine!

414
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,199
Hey, pal! Try not to ruin your evening.

415
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,280
It's up to you how it's going to end.

416
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,559
Escort them out.

417
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:09,000
All right, buddy, you're done.

418
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:11,400
Get your hands off me!

419
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,239
What?

420
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:25,840
Gentlemen, it's not worth it.

421
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,079
I understand
you came to fuck up the club.

422
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,039
It's not worth it.

423
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:39,159
Hey, dude, he's crazy. Let's bail.

424
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,199
Perhaps we could consider that
to be a job interview?

425
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,599
I know nothing about working in a club.

426
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,960
That's exactly what I said to Wiktor
the last time I talked to him.

427
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:18,840
I want you to help me find out
if my brother was murdered.

428
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,360
The whole thing stinks, doesn't it?

429
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,119
You can count on me.

430
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,679
Two more of the same.

431
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:05,920
I know that smile.

432
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:09,840
What are you up to?

433
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,760
Follow me!

434
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:16,000
Should I be happy or worried?

435
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,400
Come on! Hi, gentlemen!
Gonna be cool tonight.

436
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,760
It's gonna be good, huh?

437
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,920
Hard times are coming. You might need it.

438
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:24,840
That's it! What's up?

439
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,000
Sorry.

440
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:29,000
Surprise.

441
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:31,519
Like a… surprise, surprise.

442
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:33,320
Welcome to the Ring.

443
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,079
So, what do you say we end this beef?

444
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:37,639
Respect, homie! Respect!

445
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,199
So you work in this shithole?
You had it better in Zakopane.

446
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,480
It's my club.

447
00:47:47,559 --> 00:47:50,239
Seriously? Awesome!

448
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,400
All the world, all the world, a problem

449
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,159
All the time, all the time, a problem

450
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:03,320
In my head, in my head, I have a problem

451
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,000
In my heart, the heat that lets me live
No problem

452
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,679
Hey! You! Bartkowiak!

453
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:20,119
Sorry about last time.
I got a little carried away.

454
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:24,559
You know, that's the job.
You did what you had to do.

455
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,159
Okay. Let's forget about it.
Anyway, gotta move forward, yeah?

456
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:41,039
So?

457
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,760
Thanks.

458
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,880
And listen…

459
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:47,559
if you need someone to work here,
let me know.

460
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:49,960
What, Steppy doesn't pay enough?

461
00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:52,960
No, it isn't that.
I'd like to learn a couple of things.

462
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:54,880
Besides, sometimes the boss says things

463
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,440
that make people around here
wanna kick his ass.

464
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,880
Yeah? Like who?

465
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,960
Like me.

466
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:13,760
Good job.

467
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,920
Thanks. Can you stand this?

468
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,920
All the time, all the time, a problem

469
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,119
In my head, in my head, I have a problem

470
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,360
In my heart, the heat that lets me live
No problem

471
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,920
I just wanted to say there was no brawl,

472
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,239
and all that was a marketing stunt
promoting his newest album, Rebel.

473
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,360
In fact, we're very good friends.

474
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,679
Yeah, and Steppy D
is the craziest guy I've ever met!

475
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:49,599
Bang!

476
00:49:53,239 --> 00:49:54,119
Chojecki!

477
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,480
The land your club is on
is going to be worth a fortune soon.

478
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:06,920
Like everything around it.

479
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,880
Wiktor had problems with the club.

480
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,960
He didn't want to tell me about it, but…

481
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,239
but I know
Repeć was trying to intimidate him.

482
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:34,119
They failed,
so it ended with an execution.

483
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:37,840
No other option.

484
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,920
Do you think the police are involved?

485
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,039
Somebody pays them to look the other way.

486
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:50,840
A few companies and shops
in the area are closing.

487
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,119
Those left
are clearly afraid of something.

488
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:55,679
Nobody does anything.

489
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,119
So where do we start?

490
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,440
Sanstal.

491
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,119
Their truck killed Wiktor.

492
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,760
The club wasn't even up for sale
when they tried to buy it.

493
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:15,400
Sanstal.

494
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,960
Sanstal applied
for the construction permit!

495
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,199
They're constructing the Woźny Tower.

496
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,199
I'll try to find out more at work.

497
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,519
WOŹNY TOWER
PARK REVITALIZATION

498
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:50,000
ACCESS DENIED

499
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,840
POLICE STATION

500
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,400
WOZNY TOWER
PRESENTATION CORRECTED

501
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,400
THE CHANGE OF THE DESIGNATED USE OF LAND

502
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
OTHER FILES

503
00:52:37,039 --> 00:52:38,400
I've been looking for you.

504
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:43,159
I never said thank you
for the invitation to the theater.

505
00:52:45,239 --> 00:52:46,239
Yeah?

506
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:49,760
I liked it a lot.

507
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,039
Perhaps one day
we can see a show together.

508
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,719
You stepped a bit out of line
during the presentation.

509
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:13,079
Maybe I was wrong. I can admit my mistakes
and change my mind.

510
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,559
Very good.

511
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:19,280
You intrigue me.

512
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,559
I'm going sailing over the weekend.
Maybe you'd like to join me?

513
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:30,920
Of course, there's no hidden agenda.

514
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,440
I'll think about it.

515
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,719
See you around.

516
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:29,559
I'm here. What happened?

517
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,280
We'll have to put out a few flames
before a fire breaks out.

518
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:34,719
What fire?

519
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,360
They started sniffing around.

520
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
Who?

521
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,800
Bartkowiak and that drunken coach of his.

522
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,000
There's also a problem
with buying out the club.

523
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:53,639
And the fucking clock is ticking.

524
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:56,800
Well, yeah. A must is a must.

525
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:02,840
Can I help you with that somehow?

526
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:22,440
Just send your assistant
on a business trip.

527
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,960
To the lake. Just the way you like it.

528
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,559
Dominika?

529
00:55:30,039 --> 00:55:32,239
I assure you that is not necessary.

530
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:43,119
Irek, now you're telling me
what is necessary and what isn't?

531
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:49,320
I assure you, she's not a problem.

532
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,480
I talked to her,
she admitted she made a mistake.

533
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:57,079
She's pragmatic.

534
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:03,400
Dominika is pragmatic. I vouch for her.

535
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:12,599
You vouch for her?

536
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:17,920
Yes, I vouch for her.

537
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,119
Hey! Put it down!

538
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:35,599
Put it down!

539
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,079
You, too!

540
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:41,480
What's your name, kid?

541
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:43,480
Olaf.

542
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:44,639
Olaf?

543
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:47,039
Take a hike, Olaf.

544
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,440
Tomek.

545
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,320
I was following this guy Ireneusz a bit,

546
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,480
and his friends are peculiar.

547
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,920
I saw Scar, I saw Kołodziejczyk.

548
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,800
And who is Kołodziejczyk?

549
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:45,679
Thanks.

550
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,840
I've learned a lot.
Strange guy, dangerous.

551
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,000
I was stupid.
I lost a lot betting with his boys.

552
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:54,639
They say…

553
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,960
I know…

554
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:11,639
he's a hit man for the special forces.

555
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,760
Bartender! Where's our bottle?

556
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:19,840
Hey! Hey!

557
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,159
You want me to come and help you?

558
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,840
Relax, take it easy.

559
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:27,519
What were you talking about?

560
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,320
Stay calm!

561
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:40,800
We don't want any trouble.

562
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,559
How can we help you?

563
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:47,719
All our life…

564
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:53,000
Tommy?

565
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,760
We don't want any trouble.

566
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,280
You killed Wiktor.

567
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,119
Fuck off, leave it alone!

568
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:10,840
Ooh, I'm being nice, and you're so angry.

569
01:00:11,559 --> 01:00:13,960
So when are we signing the contract?

570
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:17,559
Tell me, what's the point
in repeating your brother's mistakes?

571
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:21,360
Isn't it better to get along?
Live in harmony?

572
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,000
Tommy, so what do you say?

573
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:35,480
I did some digging.

574
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:39,280
More than 40,000 companies
are registered in this building.

575
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,960
Forty thousand?

576
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,880
I talked to Repeć.

577
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,960
It's him…

578
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:58,880
…with Kołodziejczyk.

579
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:08,960
Go on.

580
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,079
Cayman House.
The Cayman Islands live off that.

581
01:01:19,239 --> 01:01:24,280
And where are the employees?
Offices? There are none.

582
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:28,599
They are all companies registered abroad
serving as a front.

583
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,760
Fieldstar Group Limited, too.

584
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,039
Your boss gave them the permit.

585
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,760
The president of Sanstal,

586
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:41,119
he's also one of Kołodziejczyk's men.
We saw them in the theater that night.

587
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,320
Kołodziejczyk's father got rich
when the system collapsed.

588
01:01:47,639 --> 01:01:51,840
Many people disappeared back then -
politicians, business people, military.

589
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:54,559
People say it was him.

590
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,320
And now the son has taken over -
the methods, the contacts…

591
01:01:59,639 --> 01:02:00,960
the job.

592
01:02:03,239 --> 01:02:04,920
He's untouchable.

593
01:02:06,159 --> 01:02:08,719
He knows too much, and he's too valuable.

594
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:14,199
Tomek, isn't that why
the police turn their heads the other way?

595
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,039
They have orders from the top.

596
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:18,440
Get out of here! Get out of here now!

597
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,840
Guys, it's not worth it.

598
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,559
C'mon, not worth it!

599
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:25,320
I understand
someone told you to come here

600
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,920
and fuck the place up,
but it's not worth it!

601
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,320
Hey.

602
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:25,960
Dad!

603
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:28,719
Daddy…

604
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:37,320
Baby, what a day to stop drinking, huh?

605
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:42,519
Dad!

606
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Jeez. Call an ambulance!

607
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,960
They're on their way.

608
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,400
Was Mr. Paweł Sozoniuk
provoking the guests?

609
01:05:09,719 --> 01:05:10,639
What?!

610
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:13,159
Did you see what happened?

611
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:16,360
It's pretty clear what happened!

612
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,480
They fled. Soon they'll be too far away.

613
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,800
Stay calm, please.
We need to establish the facts first.

614
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:25,440
And alcohol causes aggression.

615
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,880
I'm sorry, miss, but we need to wait
for the reports of the victims.

616
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:32,760
Victims?! What victims?!
My father is the victim!

617
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:34,559
They ran into the club and--

618
01:05:34,639 --> 01:05:35,880
Ah, yes. About the club.

619
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,480
We received claims
concerning some irregularities,

620
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,679
and we need to take a closer look, so…

621
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:43,079
someone is going to be in touch with you.

622
01:05:46,119 --> 01:05:47,119
Motherfuckers!

623
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:50,480
They want to set us up.

624
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,400
We're all alone.

625
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:06,719
Did Bartkowiak get the message?

626
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:14,920
Uncle, we should've wasted him
just like his brother.

627
01:06:16,119 --> 01:06:19,000
They're covering everything up,
as promised.

628
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,599
His brother wasn't that famous.

629
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,239
If we don't get it done in a week,
I'm gonna have problems.

630
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,079
And if I'm in trouble,
everyone's in fucking trouble.

631
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,320
Now you can go visit
that little bitch of his…

632
01:06:47,719 --> 01:06:49,719
just like you wanted.

633
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,159
PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH!
PROTESTERS ARE HEADING TO THE CAPITAL CITY

634
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:46,880
Highlander and Jackal are dead.

635
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:07,400
Mom's not answering.

636
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:10,639
I'm scared.
Let's not get deeper into this, please.

637
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,159
Let's just let it go.

638
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:15,760
But I can't.

639
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:28,279
I'm with you.

640
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,800
Check on your mom. I'll lock up the club
and we'll think about what to do next.

641
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:19,399
Why do you choose annoying boyfriends?

642
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,399
Easy, baby. It's nothing personal.

643
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,439
But this is going to be personal!

644
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:42,199
Dominika!

645
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,720
Don't shit yourself!
You think I need help taking you down?

646
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,840
Just like I didn't in the second round.

647
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,920
But my uncle wanted to be sure.

648
01:11:02,319 --> 01:11:03,880
Say hi to your brother.

649
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:07,840
When he was dying, he squealed like a pig!

650
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,239
Did you take care of the girl?

651
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,000
No. No, he didn't.

652
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,520
What now?

653
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:26,840
Rafał Kołodziejczyk.

654
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,039
Do you have a plan?

655
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:40,239
Your boss. Kołodziejczyk trusts him.

656
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:45,560
I'll convince him to help us.

657
01:12:58,359 --> 01:13:03,600
Oh, no, no, no. This is not a good time
and not a good place.

658
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,600
We know about you and Kołodziejczyk.

659
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:12,199
Everything's fucked up.

660
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,920
Get out of this town.
And never come back.

661
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,159
Bring him here. This is your chance!

662
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:29,039
Chance? Fuck. Chance!

663
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:34,039
Kołodziejczyk owns politicians
and the police.

664
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:36,199
He does whatever he wants.

665
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:41,640
If you think you can stand in his way,
you are fucking wrong.

666
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,560
Call! And get him down here.

667
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:52,079
Fuck, kids, I wanna help you.

668
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:56,000
That's why I told you
to get the fuck out of here!

669
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:58,720
Call him!
Tell him the permit has been revoked.

670
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:20,119
We have a visitor. Mi casa es su casa.

671
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:28,720
Come!

672
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:30,560
Come!

673
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:05,880
I'm sorry.

674
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:11,119
Going somewhere?

675
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:24,039
I'm not surprised.

676
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,199
Young piece of ass messed with your head.

677
01:15:33,399 --> 01:15:35,720
Everybody makes mistakes sometimes.

678
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:20,239
Say no again.

679
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,920
You killed Konrad. You killed my family.

680
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,520
And you're wasting my precious time.

681
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,760
Am I in time for the party?

682
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:16,880
This is all they had.

683
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:41,279
I didn't mean to get you involved.
Or Dominika.

684
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:50,640
Give me the fucker's address
and leave town.

685
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,279
Paweł, we may not come back.

686
01:18:55,359 --> 01:19:01,199
Are you nuts? She's my daughter.

687
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:09,720
We're coming with you.

688
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:12,640
All of us.

689
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:21,239
I know one hotshot
who really wants to help.

690
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:38,640
I wanted to learn something, but
I'm going straight into a master class.

691
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,560
To bring out the natural beauty
of a shrub,

692
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:52,279
you need to trim the pieces
limiting its development.

693
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:02,680
The cut has to be decisive,
but also very precise.

694
01:20:11,079 --> 01:20:17,319
Oh, yes, much better.
Otherwise it would grow like a weed.

695
01:20:18,359 --> 01:20:21,680
A good gardener
does not allow weeds in his garden.

696
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,800
It's a shame how few people
appreciate the art of gardening.

697
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:49,920
There's so much strength and power in it.

698
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:52,880
What does a gardener do?

699
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,359
My father used to say it's correcting
the unfinished work of God,

700
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,439
hence taking his place.

701
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,159
He was right.

702
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,640
Fuck you.

703
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:17,319
Beautiful, but poisonous.

704
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:44,439
Datura.
It smells and looks best at night.

705
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:52,760
Some can cause hallucinations.

706
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:57,119
And some can kill.

707
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,079
The miserable species of man
is like a weed!

708
01:23:19,079 --> 01:23:21,359
A shapeless pulp which does not create,

709
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,039
only devours and then dies,
turning into manure.

710
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:09,079
This is the greatest art -
to die beautifully. With dignity.

711
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:12,960
Can you do that?

712
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,119
No, you are not a samurai.

713
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:29,119
You are manure. A base for me
to build something beautiful!

THREE MONTHS LATER

715
01:26:10,239 --> 01:26:15,600
Left, right, head, good!
Left, right, head, great!

716
01:26:15,680 --> 01:26:18,920
Oh, yes, head, head, head, head!

717
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,960
And left, right, head, good!

718
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:25,840
Wojtek, go to the changing room.

719
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,399
With gloves like those,
winter is no threat.

01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,520
Ali beat Foreman in them.

721
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:38,760
Yeah. I gave them to Wiktor.

722
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,039
Only we know that.

723
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:49,680
Acquitted?

724
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:57,520
Perhaps you'd like to coach the boys, huh?

725
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,039
Hey, sweetie!

726
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:03,840
Hi!

727
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,920
You'll have to work hard to convince me.

728
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,119
Very hard.
