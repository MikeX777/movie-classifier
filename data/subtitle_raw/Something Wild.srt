1
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,234
- This takes place up in heaven.
- That's not my neighbourhood.

2
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,955
Oh, yeah. There's a pool hall up there.
That's your main place.

3
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,799
Excuse me. Excuse me,
can I get my check?

4
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,071
Hey, Charlie, check for
the gentleman in the front.

5
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,994
- Enjoy it? Here's the check.
- Thank you, Dottie.

6
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,715
Hey, whaddaya say, Frenchy!
How are you, my friend?

7
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,678
Hey, you! Hey! Hey!

8
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,031
- Hey, you didn't pay for your lunch.
- What?

9
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,755
- You didn't pay your bill, big boy.
- Oh, sure I paid. Didn't I?

10
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,030
The check's in your pocket.

11
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,872
Oh.

12
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,756
You're right.
OK, let me take care of that right now.

13
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,872
I'm sorry. I don't know
how this happened. It's just I...

14
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,755
It's just... I got a lot of things on my mind,
business things, and I simply forgot.

15
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,189
You deliberately walked out
without paying.

16
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,439
I did not. Here, come on. Just take
the money and keep the change and...

17
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,710
Fine. Maybe you'd like to tell a cop.

18
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,195
No! No, no... don't... no, don't.

19
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,513
Let me guess.
Sometimes you don't pay for your lunch.

20
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,395
Or maybe you steal the occasional
candy bar, or newspaper.

21
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,036
You're a closet rebel.

22
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,952
Oh, that's my telepager.
I gotta call the office.

23
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,399
Which way are you goin'?
I'll give you a ride.

24
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,037
Well, don't you... don't you
have to go back to work?

25
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,392
I don't work there.

26
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,714
W- wait, wait, wait. What's all this
business about the, uh... check?

27
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,036
Are you coming?

28
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,558
Uh, well, I, uh... all right.
It's just I gotta go by the bank. And then...

29
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,479
- Thank you.
- Wanna die young?

30
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,035
I gotta go by the bank,
then down to the office.

31
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,196
- I'll drop you off.
- It's downtown.

32
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,276
It's on my way.

33
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,758
Ready or not, babe?

34
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,269
You think that was pretty funny,
don't you? The way you...

35
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,349
The way you had me goin' back there.

36
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,276
- It was all right. I'm Lulu.
- Charles. Pleased to meet you.

37
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,756
Whoa!

38
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,714
- Ooh, yikes!
- Whoo! That was...

39
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,035
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Where are we goin'?

40
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,912
- I know a short cut.
- Oh, good.

41
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,395
Oh, crap.

42
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,476
- Let me see.
- Oh. It's the...

43
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,598
Hey, that's... Uh, wait.
This is the Holland Tunnel. This is wrong.

44
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,359
- Are you listening to me? Go back.
- Charlie...

45
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,232
What are you doing?

46
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,352
You're crazy.
You really know that? Oh, God!

47
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,278
I gotta go to work.
I got meetings, a million calls...

48
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,995
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, relax, Charlie. Come on.

49
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,429
Take the afternoon off.

50
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,994
You deserve it. Really.

51
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,750
I can't just take the afternoon off.
What, are you n... nuts?

52
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,159
All right, look, you turn around when we
get out of the tunnel. Let's just go back.

53
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,236
- This isn't funny.
- Want a drink?

54
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,711
No, don't! God, don't drink!
Please, this is dangerous.

55
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,796
Don't do that. God, don't.

56
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,956
Look, if you don't turn around
and take me back,

57
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,038
you're gonna make me do something
that I don't wanna do.

58
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,556
I can hardly wait, Charlie.

59
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,509
- Nice ring you got there, Charlie.
- Thank you.

60
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,029
You been married a long time?

61
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,515
Just tell me where we're going, all right?

62
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,633
- How many kids do you have, Charlie?
- That's not your concern.

63
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,955
Come on! Let's see the pictures.

64
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,799
What makes you think
I got pictures of my kids?

65
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,673
- Are you afraid of me, Charlie?
- I'm not afraid of you.

66
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,360
- Let me see 'em.
- All right, if you want to.

67
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,672
- Right there.
- Mm.

68
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,189
Very nice, Charlie. I'm impressed.

69
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,436
Thank you.

70
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,716
"Charles Driggs. Regional Manager. "

71
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,595
They just made me vice president.
I start Monday, as a matter of fact.

72
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,676
Oh, yeah? Vice president?

73
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,995
Oh, well. Here's to you, Mr Vice President.

74
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,873
- Want some?
- No, no.

75
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,836
Come on, Charlie.
Come on! It's OK.

76
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,311
- No, thank you very much.
- Be a sport, Charlie.

77
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,113
All right, what the heck. Give me it.

78
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,553
- I wanna get another bottle.
- OK, I'm gonna phone my secretary.

79
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,752
Hi. I need four pints
of some Scotch, please.

80
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,834
Hey, babe, you work here or what?

81
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,916
- Four?
- Yeah.

82
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,675
Why, of course.

83
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,156
Hi, pooch.

84
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,639
Two.

85
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,671
Stocks acquired before one January '84

86
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:49,920
should not be subject to anti-straddle
rules, however long they may be held.

87
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,715
I hope none of the above causes
any undue concern. Charles S Driggs.

88
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,156
Thank you very much.

89
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,196
Oh...

90
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,630
Is that Glenlivet up there?

91
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,436
- It is Glenlivet, isn't it?
- Mm-hm.

92
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,951
I gotta have a bottle. I'm sorry to make
you get up there, but it's my favourite.

93
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,036
- Of course.
- Thank you.

94
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,357
The reason that I like Scotch so much
is because my family's Scottish.

95
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,993
My mother's mother was an O'Connor.

96
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,429
Oh, really? How bloody interesting.

97
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,516
That makes me, like, a quarter Scottish.

98
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,395
My father's mother, she was a Hawthorne.

99
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,596
I've just about got it.

100
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,920
Little Willy was conceived on our trip
to Scotland a number of years ago...

101
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,874
Oh, crap. See if you can get me out
of that five o'clock squash with Graves.

102
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,353
Tell him... Lynn?

103
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,630
That was the office, for Christ's...

104
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,516
Coming?

105
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,919
There's a tax act in the works that
would authorise regulations to be written

106
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,715
amplifying what is meant
by "substantial reduction".

107
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,796
What?

108
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,750
Charlie, what do you do for fun
besides steal candy bars? Huh?

109
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,792
You were right. I'm a rebel.

110
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,552
I am! I just channelled my rebellion into
the mainstream. I'll give you an example.

111
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,478
In '81, I went long-term munis.

112
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,194
Everybody said
"Driggs, you're crazy, don't do it. "

113
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,515
- Munis?
- Municipal bonds. Tax-free.

114
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,200
Hell, I was locking in close to 15%.

115
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,188
I may look straight,
but deep down, I got what it takes.

116
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,476
- Do you?
- Whoa!

117
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,155
- What's this?
- Getting a room.

118
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,475
Something wrong, Charlie?

119
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,310
Maybe it's not such a good idea,
getting a room.

120
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,558
- Don't you have someplace we could go?
- How about your place?

121
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,229
I can just see the neighbours
watching you get out of the car.

122
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,835
You have money?

123
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,638
I mean, for the room.
The rest is free.

124
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,431
Well, uh...

125
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,312
Let me check.

126
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,111
I only got these credit cards -
which are company plastic.

127
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,472
Our accountant would wonder what I was
doing in a motel on a Friday afternoon.

128
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,797
- Use the cash.
- No, I can't use that.

129
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,230
- Why?
- That's money for the Christmas Club.

130
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,558
Are we not gonna get a room

131
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,470
because you're saving for Christmas
presents? In the middle of June?

132
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,234
It's not bad. I've stayed in worse.
Not much of a view, though.

133
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,109
I want you to know that I've, uh...
never done anything like this before.

134
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,117
Don't worry, Charlie. I have.

135
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,914
I wanna leave the T-shirt on, OK?

136
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,953
- Why's that?
- I don't know. I don't feel comfortable yet.

137
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,196
Oh, gosh.

138
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,590
- How do you feel now, Charlie?
- Good.

139
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,312
Want some?

140
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,510
Yeah. Thank you.

141
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,714
Can I help you find anything?

142
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,671
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

143
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,556
Ch-Ch-Charlie.

144
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,836
You game?

145
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,476
You're a funny girl.

146
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,238
Ow!

147
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,273
Agh! Yeah...

148
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,757
Oh, God! That's... That's a new T-shirt!

149
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,557
Oh, Jesus...

150
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,639
Charlie, you must not
be getting enough at home.

151
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,990
- Mm, you look good enough to eat.
- Oh, thank you.

152
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,593
Oh, God...

153
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,517
What are you doing?

154
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,716
Making a call...

155
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,949
Yeah, operator. 2127-247-270.

156
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,954
No! Don't!

157
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,036
God! Oh, God!

158
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,112
Charles Driggs' office.

159
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,880
- Is Charlie there, please?
- No!

160
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,911
He's not? It's 3.30. Shouldn't he be back
from lunch by now?

161
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,712
- Oh, please don't!
- Shh!

162
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,638
Who is this, please?
I can take a message for Mr Driggs.

163
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,792
No, this is a matter
of considerable urgency.

164
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,679
Please connect me to his superior.

165
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,916
Good afternoon, Richard Graves' office.

166
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,439
Yes, Mr Richard Graves, please.
Mr Charles Driggs is calling.

167
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,711
Yes?

168
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,713
Richard, Charles Driggs here.
Yeah, listen...

169
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:21,072
Yeah, no, just calling to let you know
that I won't be back this afternoon.

170
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,316
You won't be back? Is something wrong?

171
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,592
No, no problem. I'm just stuck in outside
meetings. You know how that goes.

172
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,950
I'd hoped we'd be able to huddle today.

173
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,116
Oh, sorry about that.

174
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,278
Well, no, I was just gonna
throw that to Dillman.

175
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,599
Yeah.

176
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,438
Yeah, I'm writing this down.

177
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,790
Oh, Charlie. Oh, Charlie...

178
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,196
How about I have copies on your desk
first thing Monday?

179
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,550
Wouldn't that... Yeah, all right, sure.

180
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,954
Goodbye.

181
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,434
Oooh!

182
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,439
Charlie, you're a really good liar
when you wanna be.

183
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,516
Oh, jeez! Don't stop, please.

184
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,315
Both her arms were covered with rings
and jewellery...

185
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,910
Accoutrements of black, Satanistic...
Please, I'm on TV.

186
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,316
- And you say she was armed?
- Definitely armed.

187
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,000
It looked like a 9 millimetre or a. 38 to me.

188
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,996
Oh, God, what time is it?

189
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,270
Time to get the hell outta Dodge.

190
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,359
- If you wanna take a shower, hurry.
- Why? We leave now, we hit traffic.

191
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,675
I'm not going back.
You have to take a bus.

192
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,315
- Why, where are you going?
- Pennsylvania, back to where I grew up.

193
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,398
Oh, really?
It's hard to imagine you growing up.

194
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,554
What, you think I was born like this?

195
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,915
Yeah, I'm writing this down!

196
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,235
"He should be back. It's 3.30!"

197
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,636
Hi, honey. I know it's short notice,
but I've been called away on business.

198
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,194
I've got a meeting tonight in Philadelphia.
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

199
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,915
So, I should be home tomorrow evening.
For sure.

200
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,994
Or maybe tomorrow morning.
Could be even later tonight.

201
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,715
Depending on, you know... Depending.

202
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,956
So, love you too, and goodbye.

203
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,388
Sure you know what you're doing?

204
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,114
No. But what the hell, you know?

205
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,316
Mom & Dad's. Dad speaking.

206
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:47,595
...Mickey Lolich pitching to a Babe Ruth
with Tony Lazzeri on second base...

207
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,359
Thanks, Rose.
... whether you put Mickey Stanley...

208
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,074
What? What's so funny?

209
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,270
- You.
- What? What'd I do?

210
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,630
Calling the waitress by her name.

211
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,910
That's what name tags are for.

212
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,349
- There you go.
- Thanks, Rose.

213
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,990
Just makes things a little friendlier,
a little more personal. I like that.

214
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,509
- Yeah. Charlie Driggs.
- Yeah.

215
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,956
What do we got?

216
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,834
Oh, my gosh. I don't believe this.

217
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,599
I have got $4 left from the Christmas Club
money. I don't be...

218
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,234
I'll get it, Charlie. You got the room.

219
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,633
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

220
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,716
I'll be right back.

221
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:40,034
I like you, Charlie.
You're a really nice guy.

222
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,316
Maybe a little too nice.

223
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,155
No, I'm sorry, we don't have a thing
available until after 7.15.

224
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,838
Yeah, that's OK.

225
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,237
- Goodnight, Rose.
- The young woman said you'd get this.

226
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,874
- She didn't pay for this?
- No, sir.

227
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,316
Lulu?

228
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,714
She said the gentleman
would pay for dinner.

229
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,634
You...

230
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,716
The gentleman would...

231
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
This is absolutely unbelievable. Uh...

232
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,554
Well, that's no problem, Rose.
I'll take care of that lickety-split.

233
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,038
Sorry. The, uh, credit cards.
How about that?

234
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,435
We don't accept any credit cards.

235
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,073
Uh...

236
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,670
Any credit cards.

237
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,877
Problem, Dad?

238
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,276
Possible cash-flow problem.

239
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,552
No, there's no problem at all.
I don't think that there...

240
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,797
...there's anything to worry about.
Come on, fellas.

241
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,913
I mean, do I look like a guy who'd run out
on a check? I mean, come on!

242
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,077
You guys!

243
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,475
Come on, Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

244
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,119
Yeah! Yee-hah!

245
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,834
What are you doing?!
I could've been killed!

246
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,315
You know you don't like
paying those things.

247
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,591
I still got the old wheels, don't I?
Did you see me?

248
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,109
You're pretty quick for an old guy.

249
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,953
The guy didn't get the license number,
did he?

250
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,798
Oh, Charlie.

251
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,951
- Where, Charlie? Here?
- 30 feet, 20 feet...

252
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,799
- We're almost... You missed it.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

253
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,353
Careful, careful!

254
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,994
Fine, all right. Just park it. Fine.

255
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,953
Park it. Lock it. Let's go.
Just leave it here.

256
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,799
- Charlie, where are you?
- Ow. I'm all right.

257
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,876
You all right?

258
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,679
- Save the burgers.
- The hamburgers. Charlie!

259
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,712
Where'd you go?
Watch out, there's a small cliff...

260
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,310
- I'll fix you up.
- Anything. It's killin' me.

261
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,317
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

262
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,312
Hey, listen, you knock one over the fence
for your old man, all right? OK.

263
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,396
Tell Scott I love him.

264
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,916
OK. Great. Good. Bye.

265
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,230
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

266
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,756
Take half of it now, half of it later
and you'll feel a lot better. There ya go.

267
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,236
Remember, it's better to be a live dog
than a dead lion.

268
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,874
I've felt the same way before.

269
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,195
- Good luck to you.
- Yeah, thank you.

270
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,556
Lulu?

271
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,436
Lulu?

272
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,120
- Oh. I'm sorry.
- What? Come here.

273
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:12,152
- What's that?
- Uh... well, it's, you know...

274
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,273
It took a while, but the whisky
caught up with me, I guess.

275
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,916
How can you drink that stuff?

276
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,153
I have to. My head's killing me.
I haven't had hard liquor in years.

277
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,831
Hair of the dog that bit you, babe.

278
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,550
God, no, no! Jesus, don't drink that!
No. I'm serious.

279
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,434
- You drank enough of it last night.
- Last night was last night.

280
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,437
- Here. Have some of this.
- No.

281
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,278
No, don't tell me no, please.

282
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,313
- This is better for you. It's tried and true.
- I don't want any of it.

283
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,351
- Do you have a hangover?
- Yes.

284
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,996
Then this is the stuff you drink
for a hangover. Come on. Drink it, please.

285
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,036
- No.
- Please.

286
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,876
- No.
- Please!

287
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,956
- No!
- Drink it!

288
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,036
Thank you.

289
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,831
Shit!

290
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,396
The guy at the restaurant
must have got the license number.

291
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,875
- Is this your car, pal?
- Huh?

292
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,673
I've been admiring your bike.

293
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,950
You interested in motorcycles?

294
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,517
No, I just like big things between my legs.

295
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,596
Thank you, officer.

296
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,596
Damn, I left my suitcase in the car.

297
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,392
I cannot afford to get mixed up
in things like this! I got responsibilities!

298
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,592
Don't worry about the car.
It's gonna be fine.

299
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,599
Oh, well, I am worried.
Let's just don't blow what we have here.

300
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,309
What are we... We gotta get that car back!

301
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,396
Just back off, Charlie!

302
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,991
If you don't wanna hang around, go back
to your barbecues and your brunches.

303
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,953
We don't have to get the car back.
We can buy a new one.

304
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,111
520, 540,

305
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,708
560, 580, 600.

306
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,150
OK. Now, I need to see
some valid identification

307
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,635
and something showing
you have insurance.

308
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,355
- Can you take my word for it?
- No, I'm sorry. I'm afraid not.

309
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,756
OK.

310
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:26,276
- How about Mr Franklin's?
- Now we're talking.

311
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,312
Come on, Charlie, talk to me.
What's on your mind?

312
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:50,470
You wanna know where I got the money
for the car, right?

313
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,553
I wanna know where you got that car,
that you can just leave it like that.

314
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,148
Then I wanna know
where you got the money.

315
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,677
D- I-V-O-R-C-E

316
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,231
Equal distribution of assets.
It's a popular tune.

317
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,476
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

318
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,036
Don't be sorry. I'm not sorry.

319
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,311
Charlie, don't worry about that car.
It was still registered in his name.

320
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,352
You got to stop worrying so much.

321
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,359
- Hi! You guys want a ride?
- Thank you, thank you.

322
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,436
Hop in.

323
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,433
- Here, let me...
- Welcome aboard.

324
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,436
Thanks for the ride.

325
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,276
Bye, Lulu.

326
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,271
- Thank you!
- Pleasure to meet you.

327
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,236
Thank you, ladies.

328
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,792
Ladies, we need something
for the gentleman here.

329
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,956
Follow me.

330
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,756
Oh, Charlie!

331
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,796
- It's you.
- Forget it.

332
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,672
No. No. I will not buy this.

333
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,473
- Look at this.
- Absolutely, with all certainty, no.

334
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,479
- It brings out the blue in those eyes.
- Yes, but still...

335
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,955
- Ladies, what do you think?
- No.

336
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,911
Very nice.

337
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,549
Oh, God!

338
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,353
If you were my mother
and I presented him as my husband,

339
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,550
- What would you think?
- Very nice.

340
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,514
But I'd get rid of those handcuffs,
if I were you.

341
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,756
- Charlie!
- Oh!

342
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,516
Don't look so surprised.

343
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,276
Get in the car.

344
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,517
- Where are we?
- Come here, Charlie.

345
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,036
- What are you doing?
- I'm setting you free.

346
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,709
- Maybe I don't wanna be free.
- Maybe you're not.

347
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,114
Come on.

348
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,357
Hello!

349
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,998
- Don't call me Lulu. Call me Audrey.
- Audrey?

350
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,998
- Audrey! What a surprise!
- Hi, Mama.

351
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,314
Mom, I want you to meet
my husband Charlie.

352
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,238
- Oh. Well, hello, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you, Mrs, uh...

353
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,078
Just call me Peaches.

354
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,395
- That's her real name.
- Peaches...

355
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,190
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

356
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,869
Charlie, exactly how did y'all decide
to come down here?

357
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,674
Audrey just said "let's go visit
my mother", so here we are.

358
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,231
Audrey is very impulsive.
It's one of the things I like about her.

359
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,511
And, dear, exactly when
did y'all get married?

360
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,155
In September.
We're still newlyweds really.

361
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,353
You'll have to visit us.
We have an extra room.

362
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,914
It's gonna be the baby's room some day.

363
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,271
Charlie fixed it up.
He's really good with his hands.

364
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,229
He wants a big family, but I think
just a boy and a girl would be nice.

365
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,477
- Don't you, honey?
- Whatever you want, honey.

366
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,673
See, Mama? He's just the kind of man
you always said I should marry.

367
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,073
Mama, we're gonna lie down for a bit
cos we've been driving all day.

368
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,078
- Why'd you tell her we were married?
- I wanted to make her happy.

369
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,954
- She doesn't know you were married?
- No. She didn't like him anyway.

370
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,753
Next time, let me know your plans.
I almost lost it.

371
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,032
That was part of the surprise. I wanted
to see if you could think on your feet.

372
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,957
How'd I do?

373
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,232
Like I said, you're a pretty good liar
when you wanna be, Charlie.

374
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,436
Audrey Hankel.

375
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,276
The guy was, like, taking all the way. So
I'm running in like an idiot, and I slide in.

376
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,518
Everybody's so surprised.
The catcher is holding the ball.

377
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,518
I slide home, I steal home,
we win the game.

378
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,479
Oh, God, it was great!

379
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,797
Well, I'm glad it was
such a good game for you.

380
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,039
- This is good food too.
- Well, I expect you to eat it all up then.

381
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,912
You've got a real wife somewhere,
don't you, Charlie?

382
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,430
Uh, well,
that's a little complicated, Peaches.

383
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,711
- Do you love my daughter?
- I just met her recently.

384
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,796
It's kinda hard to...

385
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,870
You take care then.
She's got some strange notions about life.

386
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,797
Yep. I know.

387
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,719
Oh, my gosh!

388
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,952
I had this dress in high school.
Mama saves everything.

389
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:27,469
- Don't you, Mama?
- Of course I do.

390
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,510
We packed a suitcase and I left it sitting
right by the door. I'm glad I had this dress.

391
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:37,475
But poor Charlie's gotta wear what he's
got on the whole weekend. Poor baby.

392
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,797
Goodbye, Mama.

393
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,276
We'll try and get down more often.
Charlie's job keeps him so busy.

394
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,517
Oh, I understand, dear.
Just come when you can.

395
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,151
- Give her a kiss.
- Goodbye, Peaches.

396
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,397
Come on. She's my mama, Charlie.
Give her a kiss.

397
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,394
- Bye, Charlie.
- Thank you for the meal. It was...

398
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,238
- Bye, Max
- Heads up, Max.

399
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,875
- I hope things work out for you, Charlie.
- Good luck to you too!

400
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,195
It was wonderful meeting you, Peaches.

401
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,276
Here, let me...

402
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,356
Come on! Let's go.

403
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,399
- You wanna tell me where we're going?
- No.

404
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,356
- So long!
- Bye.

405
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,357
I love you, Mama.

406
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,710
- Jesus, what's this?
- Get ready, Charlie.

407
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,595
My high school reunion.
God, I'm so nervous.

408
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,676
Are you kidding me?

409
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,077
Wait, wait, wait!
Who am I supposed to be?

410
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,156
- Oh!
- OK.

411
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,555
Am I supposed to sign in here?

412
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,189
- Audrey Hankel?
- Yeah.

413
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,277
Remember me? Donna Penski?

414
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,830
- Yeah, sure, Donna. How are you?
- Fine.

415
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,349
Audrey! James. James Williams.

416
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,033
James! Hi!

417
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,720
How you doin'?
This is my husband Charlie.

418
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,388
- Hello, James.
- Pleased to meet you, Charlie.

419
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,318
We have a booklet
with the names and addresses

420
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,908
of all the people
who weren't able to make it tonight.

421
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,359
Oh, really?

422
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,391
Audrey! Smile, please.

423
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,078
Thank you.

424
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,239
- I bet you've got kids, don't you?
- Mm-hm. Two, a boy and a girl.

425
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,715
Oh, that's nice. What are their names?

426
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,356
Their names?

427
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,075
- Scott and Leslie.
- Scott and Leslie.

428
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,076
Whooo!

429
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,556
I want a big Badger yell.

430
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,796
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo!

431
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,397
That guy's in my office!

432
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,193
I've always been an introverted, shy guy.

433
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,712
Charles Driggs!

434
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,594
Ah! God! No!
Uh, uh, uh... Just let me do the talking.

435
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,836
- Larry!
- What the hell are you doing here?

436
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,872
I thought you never got out of the office!

437
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,595
You remember my wife Peggy?
You met Charles at the Christmas party.

438
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,951
Congrats on that promotion.
You really deserve it.

439
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,993
- I knew you'd go right to the top.
- Thanks. That's nice of you to say.

440
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,759
I bet you say that to all the new VPs.

441
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:28,553
Uh, this is Audrey.
We've known each other for...

442
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,749
We're lovers.

443
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,111
Only in the sense
that all human beings are... lovers.

444
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,276
Audrey Driggs?

445
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,119
I had to take his name for the baby's sake.

446
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,312
- You're having his child?
- I think it's his child.

447
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,110
Larry works in accounting,
down the hall from me, right?

448
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,755
Is this the guy who would've wondered
why you were using company plastic

449
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,792
yesterday afternoon
in that motel in New Jersey?

450
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,958
Hell, Charles, we could've covered that.
Just let me know next time.

451
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,716
See?

452
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,393
This is my wife Peggy.

453
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,308
We went to school together, Larry.
Remember? It's our reunion.

454
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,396
- Hello, Audrey.
- Hi.

455
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,312
Reunions are fun, aren't they?

456
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,237
Come on, Larry.

457
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,316
Will you excuse us?

458
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,589
Driggs, I didn't think you had it in you.

459
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,916
Oh-ho...

460
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,555
- Thank you.
- Charlie!

461
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,195
- Charlie, relax.
- Relax?

462
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:37,318
What were you doing over there?
That guy works in my office.

463
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,639
If he opens his mouth about any of this,
and, believe me, he will, I'm ruined.

464
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,796
Charlie, you are vice president.

465
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:50,558
Did you see the look on that guy's face?
He thinks you're a hero.

466
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,916
Charlie, what's wrong?

467
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,272
I'll tell you what's wrong. Company
plastic. Valid company credit cards.

468
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,153
They were in my wallet.
It was in my jacket. It's gone.

469
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,034
My MCI number, my access card
to get me into my own building!

470
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,711
I mean, God knows who's got them!
My Christmas Club voucher... Oh, crap!

471
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,679
- If I don't get it back, you know what?
- What?

472
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,916
I'm fucked!

473
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,036
Charlie, I got it.

474
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,076
I got your wallet.

475
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,032
You got my wallet?

476
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,357
It fell out of your jacket and I picked it up.

477
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,116
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

478
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,955
It's in the glove compartment.

479
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,516
Lulu, look. Uh...

480
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,952
God, you're a great girl. You got
a few problems, but you're a great girl.

481
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:04,153
And you're loaded with potential.
But you're too much for me.

482
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,714
I can't handle this.

483
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:11,630
Let me get my wallet and I'll catch a bus
and go back to my boring, very safe life.

484
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,552
While I've still got one.

485
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,878
Charlie, I'm sorry. I didn't think
it was that important. I'm sorry.

486
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,870
You believe me, don't you?

487
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,956
Yeah, yeah, course I do.

488
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,078
Tomorrow you're gonna wake up,
you're still gonna be Charlie Driggs.

489
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,748
And this'll all be over and done with.

490
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,314
So why don't we enjoy it while we can.

491
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
And then tomorrow, no more Lulu.

492
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,796
Unless you really wanna go.

493
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,676
Then go.

494
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,838
The Feelies! The Feelies!
Come on! Thank you!

495
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,040
You want something... from the bar?

496
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,355
I sure would love a soda.

497
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:23,591
I'm gonna get some air.
I'll be outside, over there.

498
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,516
OK?

499
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,711
If I could just... Is it possible...?

500
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,831
Got a light?

501
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,077
Uh... Well, let me... No, I don't think so.

502
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,078
I'm Irene. I don't believe in name tags.

503
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,953
Oh. Right. Charlie. L, uh...

504
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,188
never had many concrete convictions
about them one way or another.

505
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:06,357
- You're Audrey's husband, aren't you?
- Uh... Yeah.

506
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,438
Yeah? You don't sound too convinced.

507
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:13,314
I can hardly believe it myself.
We haven't known each other long.

508
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,513
- You don't exactly seem her type.
- Yeah, well, what can I tell you?

509
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,634
Hi, Audrey.
Check out Charlie at the end of the bar.

510
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,716
Dated, married, church wedding,
you know... And, uh...

511
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,199
I had no idea
Charles had such a way with the ladies.

512
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,673
Neither did he.

513
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,268
- I work in the city.
- Doing what?

514
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,589
You seem overly interested
in Audrey and me.

515
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,676
We're old friends.

516
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,596
Can I get a soda? Can I get a soda?

517
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,708
Charlie?
I get up to New York once in a while.

518
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,876
- What?
- I get up to New York once in a while.

519
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:57,796
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

520
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,797
- Like to have a drink with me?
- What?

521
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,956
Wanna have a drink in New York?

522
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:06,039
Yeah. No! No. I'm married.
I got... I'm a married man.

523
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,399
Listen...

524
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,478
Enjoy the reunion, all right?
Nice meeting you.

525
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,356
Oh, God!

526
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,556
Hi, baby. Surprise!

527
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,558
Hi, Charlie.

528
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,875
- Let's go.
- Why? What's wrong?

529
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,956
Let's just go.

530
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,320
Charles, hey. Are you
gonna be around tomorrow?

531
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,000
Uh... we kind of wanna
get an early start back.

532
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:22,031
- How about brunch?
- Uh, how about brunch?

533
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:26,358
- Hi there!
- Hi. Charles Driggs. Audrey's husband.

534
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:30,075
Well, Charlie, pleased to meet you.
I'm Ray. This is Irene.

535
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,673
Yeah, we've met.

536
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:34,633
- Hi. I'm Larry Dillman.
- Hi. I'm Ray. This is Irene.

537
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:37,957
Irene, hi. This is Chloe
and my wife Peggy. Ray and Irene.

538
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:38,717
Hi.

539
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,638
Well, we know old Peg. Don't we, Peg?

540
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,353
Hi, Ray.

541
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,117
- Charles and I work together in New York.
- Really? Ain't that somethin'?

542
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,630
- Slavin' away over the old...
- Here he comes now!

543
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:54,274
Haven't seen you in a while, Audrey.

544
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,029
- Seems like only yesterday, Ray.
- How time changes things.

545
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,470
- Oh, too true.
- That's what life's all about, huh?

546
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,194
Speaking of changing things,
we have to go.

547
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:07,232
- See you all in ten years.
- OK.

548
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,510
- Take care, Charlie.
- Nice to meet you.

549
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:13,553
- Listen, shall we... OK, let's do it.
- Bye, Peg. Bye, Larry.

550
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,194
Boy, there's a guy who landed on his feet.

551
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,435
How's that?

552
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,758
Nine months ago, his wife takes the kids
and runs off with the family dentist.

553
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,599
It's the best thing
that ever happened to him.

554
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,676
Yeah, I believe that.

555
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,914
- Damn it!
- Don't flood it.

556
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,274
Hi, you all!

557
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,712
- How'd you get out here so fast?
- Always keep 'em guessing, Charlie.

558
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,070
I thought we could have a drink together.

559
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,919
The party's over here.
We still got time for a quick one.

560
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,235
Thanks, but no thanks, Ray.

561
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,316
Oh, come on!

562
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,836
It'll be fun.

563
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,034
- You don't mind, do you, Charlie?
- No, it's OK with me. Honey?

564
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,990
Whaddaya say, Audrey? One drink?

565
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,275
You don't want me to tell Charlie
how you spent your free periods, do ya?

566
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,232
- Come on! One drink!
- OK, one drink.

567
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,113
All right! I'll drive, Charlie!

568
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,475
Hey, Charlie, how do you like this baby?

569
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,477
- Oh, God, it's a beauty, Ray.
- Yeah.

570
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:32,388
- They don't make 'em like this any more.
- Boy, this baby travels.

571
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,958
- What do you drive?
- L, uh... a Ford station wagon.

572
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:38,036
A station wagon? Oh!

573
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,756
Hey, guys! How ya doin', huh?

574
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,156
- Larry, baby!
- We're going for pizza. Wanna come?

575
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,350
- Uh... pizza?
- I don't want no pizza.

576
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,278
No, no, we can't. We've made other plans.

577
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:02,076
Sure. Anyway, see you Monday morning,
Mr Vice President, huh?

578
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,516
OK! See ya!

579
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,836
He'll get in trouble with those guys.

580
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:18,993
- So you're a vice president, huh?
- Yep. Just got promoted.

581
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:23,038
Well, we're gonna have to make this
a night to remember.

582
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,833
Hoo!

583
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:41,914
Irene, why don't you and Charlie
get us some six packs?

584
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,917
- Yeah, come on, Irene.
- Ray!

585
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,510
Where are your manners?
It's your town. Why don't you go?

586
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,559
I'll go.

587
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:51,999
Let him go.

588
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,519
I'll go.

589
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,951
- Irene, why don't you go with her?
- I'll go with her.

590
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,956
Ooooh-eee!

591
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,476
Look at that Audrey.

592
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,149
She is a work of art, huh?

593
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,316
Oh, yeah.

594
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,672
- You're a lucky man, Charlie.
- Oh, don't I know it!

595
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,758
- How long have you been married?
- What is it now? A year ago, September.

596
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,996
- Still newlyweds, really.
- Yeah?

597
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,272
- You know...
- That's wonderful. It really is.

598
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,359
- Where you living these days?
- We got a nice place out in Long Island.

599
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,358
- Yeah? Where?
- Stony Brook.

600
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,997
- I'm fixing a room up for the kids...
- You got kids?

601
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,669
- Well, we intend to have them.
- Yeah? That's great.

602
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,156
- Audrey was a little wild in high school.
- Oh, well, yes, I can believe that!

603
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,589
But I knew
she'd get herself together one day.

604
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,711
Oh... Thank you, Ray.

605
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,429
Irene, how long has he been in town?

606
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:00,790
- I don't know.
- When did he get out?

607
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,194
I don't know!

608
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,959
- Come on, Irene!
- I swear to God, I don't know.

609
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,231
I was just as surprised as you were
when he showed up.

610
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,316
Oh, God.

611
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:13,194
I wonder what they're talking about.

612
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,515
Now there's a question.

613
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,111
- I shouldn't be asking you this...
- No, no, no. Anything.

614
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,309
Yeah?

615
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,238
Audrey was the hottest thing in school.

616
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,070
And I was wondering,
what is she really like?

617
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,196
What a gal, Ray. I mean, what a gal!

618
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,392
She is... She's impulsive and...
her imagination...

619
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,398
No, no, no! I mean in bed.

620
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:45,157
Oh!

621
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:47,236
What am I doing?

622
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:51,429
Oh, God! Uh... well, she's, uh...

623
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,356
Come on, Charlie, you gotta admit she
looks like she could fuck you right in half.

624
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,713
- I mean, just fuck you to pieces.
- Ray, there's no call for that kind of talk.

625
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,276
You're right.

626
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,636
You're right.

627
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,072
I understand.

628
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,316
Sorry, Charlie.

629
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,112
No...

630
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,196
Sorry, Charlie.

631
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,477
Come on...

632
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,231
We friends?

633
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,316
Sure. Oh, yeah.

634
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,711
OK.

635
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,912
I'm gonna go get me some smokes.
I'll be right back.

636
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:39,470
You're a good guy, Charlie.
I don't care what they say.

637
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,155
Irene, Charlie's lonely out there.

638
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,359
Why don't you give us
a coupla minutes alone?

639
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,716
Go on! Go keep him company.

640
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:59,559
- I got nothing to say to you, Ray.
- Come here!

641
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,874
I was hoping you'd show up tonight.

642
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,592
- When'd you get out?
- I've been lookin' for you.

643
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,917
How did you get out, Ray?

644
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,998
- Who's this Charlie guy?
- He's nobody. I just met him.

645
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:19,671
Oh, yeah? He's out there braggin'
about what a great piece of ass you are.

646
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,711
Bullshit, Ray. You're sick.

647
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,229
He's too nice
to say something like that.

648
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:25,395
Audrey!

649
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,109
I missed you so goddamn much!

650
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,559
- Every sweet little part of you.
- Don't...

651
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,949
You should've never quit me, baby.

652
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,197
I tried to explain to you
in the last letter I wrote you.

653
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:44,393
Write me?! Fuck, Audrey! I'm up
for a nickel and all you can do is write?!

654
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,715
I don't wanna talk about it, Ray.

655
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:51,516
I said I'd have one drink with you.
But it's over. Remember that, OK?

656
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,397
Are you saying
that you don't love me any more?

657
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:03,836
Is that what you're saying?

658
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,118
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, right.

659
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,719
Hey, Charlie's got a beer.
Where's my beer?

660
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,356
- Right here.
- Aah... Damn! I forgot to get cigarettes.

661
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,869
Can you get me some cigarettes,
please? Please?

662
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,070
Sure. There ya go.

663
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,070
Thanks, Irene. You're all right.

664
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,359
- Hurry up, Irene.
- Oh, yeah.

665
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,871
Charlie, watch this.

666
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,468
Ray, wait! Ray!

667
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,909
- What are you doin', Ray?
- What's it look like?

668
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,474
- Irene!
- Wait, there's Irene!

669
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,716
She's a big girl. She'll be OK.

670
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:59,960
Besides, this is your night to celebrate.
I thought I'd make it just the three of us.

671
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,310
Come on, hop up in front. Come on!

672
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,512
- Yeah, well, all right, Ray.
- Come on. There ya go.

673
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,791
- Come on, Audrey.
- No.

674
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,956
Well, looks like it's you and me, pal.

675
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,275
What are we stoppin' for now?

676
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:33,108
Still gotta get my smokes, remember?

677
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:36,596
Come on, Charlie.
I wanna show you something.

678
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:41,191
Oh, boy.
I'm gonna grab some more beverages.

679
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,071
- You want anything?
- Stay here with me.

680
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,590
Audrey, I'll leave the radio on.
You don't think she'd leave us, do you?

681
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:49,950
No. You wouldn't do that, would you?

682
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:53,709
- Come on. I wanna show you something.
- Great.

683
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,636
Take it easy.

684
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:01,915
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

685
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,510
- Ever been on TV?
- No, Ray. I've never been on television.

686
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,358
- Here's your chance.
- Why? What?

687
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,189
- You're new vice president, huh?
- I am the new VP. Don't you forget it.

688
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,436
All right. Well, make a speech.

689
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,876
Oh, look at that!

690
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,236
- You're on, slick.
- Yeah.

691
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,393
Uh...

692
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,437
Hello! Hey! Hey!

693
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:23,788
- Hello.
- How are you?

694
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,388
- What can I do for you?
- Let me have a pack of Marlboros.

695
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,795
Marlboros. Will that be all?

696
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,629
...to Larry Dillman,
a man whose discretion

697
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:36,309
is exceeded only
by his bad taste in suits.

698
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:38,437
Thank you. Thank you very much.

699
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,391
Thank you. Sit down!

700
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,715
Please, sit down.

701
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,633
I don't think we got Marlboros.

702
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,550
...thanks to my wonderful wife Audrey,
who has stood by me through...

703
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,557
Wow!

704
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,557
Hey!

705
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,990
Jesus Christ! Ray, what are you...? Oh!

706
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,838
You OK?

707
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,996
Bastard, Ray!

708
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,276
Are you all right, Charlie?

709
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,674
Get up! Get up!

710
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,112
Ray, goddamn you!

711
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,196
Just shut up, Audrey!

712
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:55,512
I'm gonna tell you something, Charlie.

713
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,154
When I used to do this for a living,

714
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,431
I used to pull a job at some liquor store,

715
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,836
run around the corner,
pull off the ski mask I was wearing,

716
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:09,954
put on a different coat and walk
right back into the place I just robbed.

717
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,631
Man, it was wild! They'd be so flipped out,
they wouldn't know their own mothers.

718
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,038
I'd be standing there when they described
what happened and who robbed 'em.

719
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:23,995
Half the time, they thought
it was some spook that did it.

720
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:26,634
They'll see your face
on the videotape, pal.

721
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:29,069
It just might be you they get.

722
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,596
Come on! Come on, move it!

723
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:19,077
OK, boys and girls. Let's play
a little game of true confessions.

724
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,795
- Get away from him. Just get away.
- Just checking his nose.

725
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:28,152
Now I know you two
can't really be married.

726
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,952
I haven't seen you in a while,

727
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,231
but they woulda sent me papers
if you were divorcing me.

728
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:38,598
So why don't you two lovebirds
just tell me what the fuck is goin' on?

729
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,318
Tell me, goddammit!

730
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,273
- Knock it off in there!
- You knock it the fuck off!

731
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:48,597
Stop it, Ray! Cut it out! Ray, stop it!

732
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,196
I'll tell you, all right?

733
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:56,712
He's just a guy. I picked him up
on the street in New York.

734
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:03,637
We pretended to be married for Mama,
and it just carried over to the reunion.

735
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,116
The guy's got a real wife
and two real children.

736
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,073
- It's just a joke that got outta hand.
- Bullshit!

737
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,952
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit!

738
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,198
- Shut up in there!
- You shut the fuck up, goddammit!

739
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,356
Ray...

740
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:42,074
I met him yesterday.
There's nothing going on.

741
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,270
Nothing. OK?

742
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:48,029
Look at you.
You look like a goddamn TV show.

743
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,311
Just like he does.

744
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:59,908
I may not be educated,
like Charlie-boy there,

745
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,996
but I am not stupid.

746
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,196
She's telling you the truth, Ray.

747
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,476
Is she?

748
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,355
Is she telling me the truth, Charlie?

749
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:11,995
Yes.

750
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,873
Yeah? Here...

751
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,680
Ray, you're making a big deal
out of nothing!

752
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,588
- I'm sorry I lied to you, Charlie!
- You're still lying!

753
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:23,553
I know for a fact
that your friend isn't married.

754
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,071
- His wife left him because of you.
- What? What?!

755
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,792
Are you out of your mind?!

756
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:31,718
I only met him yesterday!

757
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,957
How many times
do you want me to say it?

758
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,236
Tell me, Charlie,

759
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,038
when did your wife leave you?

760
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:50,278
I can't imagine where you heard that, Ray.
That's absolutely ridiculous.

761
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,595
- Tell me, Charlie.
- It's not true.

762
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:56,315
I have a wife. I have a family. I have...

763
01:04:56,720 --> 01:04:58,551
Forget it.

764
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,830
- Charlie...
- Ow! Last September.

765
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,876
Last September?

766
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,395
You're a really good liar, Charlie.

767
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,036
Oooo-eee!

768
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:20,035
Charlie, this is Audrey.
Audrey, this is Charlie.

769
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,316
Who's shittin' who here?

770
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,876
Unbelievable!

771
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,349
Let me ask you a question.

772
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,631
- Did you ever box?
- No.

773
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,196
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

774
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:46,276
- You sure?
- Yeah.

775
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:50,392
- Here. Have a shot.
- No. Thank you.

776
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,756
Audrey?

777
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,955
I used to spar around a lot in the joint.

778
01:06:02,080 --> 01:06:05,629
It was just me
and a bunch of the brothers.

779
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,479
They all thought I was crazy.

780
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:13,116
By the time I got out of there though,
they all had respect for me, Charlie.

781
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,436
Got my nose broke three times
in three years, but... what the hell?

782
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:22,236
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya.

783
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,479
No, it won't kill you, Ray,
but violence never solved anything.

784
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:30,513
What goes around, comes around.
You're gonna learn that some day.

785
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,074
Ray, would you just get him outta here?

786
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:37,034
Shit, baby, he's gonna have the cops here
before we get around the block.

787
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,472
Why? What is he gonna say?
Nobody forced him to come along.

788
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,478
If he opens his mouth,
he can take his house in the suburbs,

789
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,398
and his lawn and his station wagon,

790
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:50,637
and his normal life,
and flush it right down the toilet.

791
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:55,038
Unless, of course,
you were lying about that too, Charlie?

792
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,355
No, I'm not lying about that.

793
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,233
Do you understand the situation?

794
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,278
Yeah.

795
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:20,750
I'm sure you two
will be very happy together.

796
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,836
Get the fuck out.

797
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:44,759
Old habits die hard, huh, baby?

798
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:48,276
Charlie!

799
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,948
- Fill her up?
- Yeah, fill her up.

800
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,394
Fill her up?

801
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,988
Uh, yeah. You take credit cards... Nelson?

802
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:32,194
- Yeah, Charlie. All major brands.
- How'd you know my name?

803
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,397
- Your tag.
- Oh!

804
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,476
Yeah, yeah.

805
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:39,436
Thank you.

806
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,355
- All right, Charlie, that's $13.50.
- Thanks, Nelson. Put it on there.

807
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,552
And put a soda on there too.
And a road map.

808
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,910
Hey, anything you want, Charlie.

809
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,190
Excuse me, Joy.

810
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,670
- Hey, that shirt. What happened?
- What?

811
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:14,271
- Your shirt?
- Oh. I'm, uh... prone to nosebleeds, so...

812
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,913
- Yeah, let's put a shirt on.
- Put a shirt on.

813
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:22,157
OK? And how about a hat?

814
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,350
You got it. Right here for you.

815
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:28,758
- And, uh... do you have any trousers?
- No trousers. How about some shorts?

816
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,793
- Shorts? Yeah! Let's go with some shorts.
- You're about a large, right?

817
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,878
Large. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good.

818
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,036
OK. How about some socks?

819
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,435
Socks? Yeah, put some socks on the...

820
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:44,358
- There you go.
- Sounds good.

821
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,588
- Fix me up, Nelson.
- Hey, Charlie? Attempt to be cool.

822
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,512
- Hey, you some kind of spy, Charlie?
- Shh, Nelson!

823
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,676
OK...

824
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:19,119
- Sunglasses. I need sunglasses.
- Nah, keep 'em. You're beautiful.

825
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,316
OK, all right.

826
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:26,472
- There you are.
- OK.

827
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,275
You oughta really see somebody
about that nose.

828
01:11:31,400 --> 01:11:34,039
A broken nose ain't gonna kill ya, Nelson.

829
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,628
OK, there's that, there's this...
OK, thank you.

830
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,637
- Hey.
- All right, Nelson.

831
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,436
Hello. How are you?

832
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:47,796
Hi.

833
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,632
- Can I help you?
- How much are these babies?

834
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,512
$49.95.

835
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,596
- Credit cards OK?
- Sure.

836
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,117
Ring 'em up.

837
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,390
Will there be anything else?

838
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,076
Yeah.

839
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,153
Yeah. One of these shirts.

840
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:42,038
"I have recently completed managerial
training for the LB Discount Shoe stores. "

841
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,357
"It looks like I'll soon
be living in Fairfield, Iowa,

842
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:48,119
where a new franchise has just opened. "
Oh, boy!

843
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:51,915
"Accompanying me will be my wife Joyce
and three small fries,

844
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:56,750
Billy, 5, Tina, 3, and the newest addition,
little Eric Junior, 11 months. "

845
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,836
What a dumb shit!

846
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:01,156
- What?
- I'm gonna change.

847
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:04,198
Yeah, I wanna see
how that new suit looks on you.

848
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,073
- Hey, Audrey!
- Yeah?

849
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:30,998
- I wanna see how that suit looks on you.
- Wait!

850
01:15:31,720 --> 01:15:34,553
- We going swimming or aren't we?
- Just wait a minute.

851
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,591
Hey, Audrey, what's goin' on?

852
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,676
- Don't come in.
- You all right?

853
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:43,748
Hey!

854
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:47,354
Audrey!

855
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,152
Come here!

856
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:51,236
What are you doing?

857
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,949
- It's over this way.
- Stop it! Stop it, Ray!

858
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:58,514
Come on, I'll show you. Come on!

859
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:01,834
No, no...

860
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:04,952
You wanted to swim?
You wanna swim, swim!

861
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,836
Asshole!

862
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,234
They look like a terrible couple.

863
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,518
- We're closed.
- All I need is two minutes.

864
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:33,232
We're open tomorrow at seven.

865
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:36,272
I already know what I want.
Come on. Please?

866
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,998
Mister? Do you need any help?

867
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:44,750
- No, I'm fine, thanks.
- OK.

868
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,596
You like it around here?

869
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:57,159
It's OK.

870
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:59,396
Don't you get kinda bored?

871
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,676
Yeah, sometimes.

872
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:05,196
Sometimes?

873
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,998
Sometimes what?

874
01:17:08,120 --> 01:17:11,351
Sometimes it's boring,
or sometimes there's something to do?

875
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,357
Sometimes it's boring.

876
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,315
- What's your name?
- Tracy.

877
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,836
Tracy, I'm Ray.

878
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,716
- Hi.
- Hi.

879
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,356
OK. Fine. Here we go.

880
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:21,155
I'll have a JD burger and some fries.
And some extra pickles.

881
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,510
And a beer and a coke.

882
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,553
- You got it.
- Thanks.

883
01:18:45,480 --> 01:18:47,596
Hey, fella, you using the telephone?

884
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:49,676
No, go ahead.

885
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,874
Sit down and relax
and we'll get you some coffee.

886
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,560
Darlene? Coffee, please, for George.

887
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:38,556
- How about dessert?
- Let me have the Rustler's Rhapsody.

888
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:42,116
- Rustler's Rhapsody.
- Just a coffee for me, Darlene.

889
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,596
- In a flash.
- You don't mind, do you, Ray?

890
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,757
You're outta your mind.
You don't know what you're doin'.

891
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:50,677
Charlie!

892
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,912
You are one dumb son of a bitch!

893
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,714
I'm almost starting to like you, Charlie.

894
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:00,796
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Darlene.

895
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:03,276
I want Lulu.

896
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,757
Is that your name this week? Lulu?

897
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,349
Yes.

898
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:12,951
You know, Charlie,
she's not gonna be too happy

899
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:16,231
driving around in a station wagon
the rest of her life.

900
01:20:16,360 --> 01:20:18,316
You better think about that.

901
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:22,869
You better ask yourself
if you really want her.

902
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,678
I really want her.

903
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:28,630
Awww.

904
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,591
Great.

905
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,639
Charlie, you gotta fight
for a woman like this.

906
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:41,156
I don't have to fight you. We'll waltz outta
here, and there's not a thing you can do.

907
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,798
Grrr!

908
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:49,271
Oh, Charlie. You are somethin'.
You are somethin'!

909
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:52,390
Take a look over there.

910
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,397
Go ahead.

911
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,315
- Evening, officer.
- How's it goin'?

912
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:10,990
Ray, you're a convicted felon
in possession of a concealed weapon.

913
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:15,113
You robbed a grocery store,
assaulted that poor kid with a gun.

914
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,231
You left Pennsylvania, which is gonna
come as a surprise to your parole officer.

915
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:24,592
And I'd be willing to wager
that Cadillac of yours is hot.

916
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:26,916
Charlie...

917
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,718
Now it's you with something to lose.

918
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,592
Fuck you.

919
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,635
- He's got you, Ray.
- Fuck you too, Lulu.

920
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,393
Evening, officers.

921
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,080
- How ya doin'?
- Oh, pretty good, thank you.

922
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,236
Hand over the car keys.

923
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:01,040
Come on, hand over the car keys.

924
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,230
At JD's-where else?

925
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:17,116
- Let's go.
- You're gonna regret this.

926
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,390
- Well, life's full of regrets.
- No.

927
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,754
You are really gonna regret this.

928
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:26,352
- Now your wallet.
- Charlie, come on!

929
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,151
You think you're pretty smart,
don't you, Charlie?

930
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,477
Pretty smart.

931
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:42,474
But look, Ray, just to show you
there's no hard feelings,

932
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,111
this one's on me.

933
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:54,474
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

934
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,439
The gentleman said
you'd take care of this.

935
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:18,071
That son of a bitch.

936
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:30,794
Yow!

937
01:23:30,920 --> 01:23:32,319
God, that was great!

938
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:36,399
Oh, man, that'll teach him
to fool with Charlie Driggs, I'll tell you.

939
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:59,517
OK, liar. Get out!

940
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:03,717
- What, you jokin'?
- You saved me, I saved you. Now get out!

941
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:07,071
- I'm not getting out of the car.
- Get out of the fucking car!

942
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:10,192
- I'm in the middle of Virginia!
- Charlie, go!

943
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,231
- No! I'm not...
- Goddammit! Get out!

944
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:16,353
- It's the middle of the night!
- Get out of the fucking car, Charlie!

945
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,515
OK...

946
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,596
What are you...?

947
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:22,478
Aw...

948
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:39,198
You're... Sometimes I don't know
whether you're kiddin' around or not.

949
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:43,232
Goddamn you, Charlie!
I saw your wedding ring!

950
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,749
Shit, I saw the family pictures!

951
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:49,270
I get involved with a married man
who's not even married?!

952
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:52,153
I was married
when those pictures were taken.

953
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:54,709
Very funny.

954
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,276
I wear the ring because
I hate to admit that my family fell apart.

955
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:03,914
I told you I was married to protect myself.

956
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,873
And then I was afraid that if I told you,
you'd take off.

957
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,991
You're right, asshole. I would've.

958
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:13,113
- You were lying a blue streak to me too.
- Exactly.

959
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,471
Oh, thank you, Lord!

960
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,309
Come in, come in.
Come, come, come! Come around!

961
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,874
Come in! Come in! Come in! Come in!

962
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,638
OK...

963
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:56,957
I'll be back in a couple of days, OK?
You gonna be here?

964
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,514
Did your sister really run off
with a Bible salesman?

965
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:02,791
I swear to God. The religious types
are the worst kind.

966
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:05,593
- I'll be back, OK? You'll be here?
- Mm-hm.

967
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,714
OK, I better get going, all right?

968
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,150
- Go on, go on. Go home!
- See ya.

969
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,236
Hurry up. Go on.

970
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:11,869
...can't do anything but fail.

971
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,312
Did you see the SOS
Jesus COD'd to you?

972
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,838
Are you saved?

973
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,916
Are you good?

974
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,156
Are you OK?

975
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:27,716
It's late.

976
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:30,116
Time to go.

977
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:34,916
Thanks, Reverend Jim. It's 5 o'clock
right now, a. m., Baltimore time.

978
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:36,996
We're comin' at you live.

979
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,309
It's so strange.

980
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,834
- Did you say something?
- I just don't wanna go to my apartment.

981
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,996
Shit...

982
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:05,677
Well...

983
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:07,950
you can stay at my place.

984
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,798
For tonight.

985
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,552
There's not much in the way of furniture,
but there's plenty of room.

986
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:17,196
OK, thanks.

987
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,476
Audrey Hankel.

988
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,478
Yeah, uh... Stony Brook.

989
01:28:51,640 --> 01:28:53,710
Charles Driggs.

990
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:56,400
Yeah, with a D. D-R, yeah.

991
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,795
Lemme have the address on that.

992
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:02,435
1427 Maple. 1427 Maple. Thanks.

993
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:54,876
- Where's the bathroom?
- Down the hall, to the left.

994
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:38,956
Charlie...

995
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:45,954
Yeah?

996
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:50,915
What are you gonna do now you've seen
how the other half lives?

997
01:30:51,040 --> 01:30:52,996
The other half?

998
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,076
The other half of you.

999
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,432
Hiya, Charlie.

1000
01:31:31,680 --> 01:31:32,635
Ray!

1001
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,596
Get up!

1002
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,919
Let's see what you're made of now,
Charlie!

1003
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:51,676
Charlie?

1004
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,156
Charlie?

1005
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,272
Ray, stop it! You'll kill him!

1006
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,356
I'm just warming up!

1007
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,236
Get out of the way!

1008
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,518
Ow!

1009
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:09,110
I'm glad to see you finally
made it to the suburbs, bitch!

1010
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,392
Come here!

1011
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:19,276
I don't care...

1012
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:24,149
what she tells you, I know my wife.

1013
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:28,389
And you white-bread VIP types
just don't do it for her.

1014
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:32,669
- You all right there, Charlie?
- Charlie, I'm gonna get help!

1015
01:32:36,840 --> 01:32:38,512
Charlie!

1016
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:41,873
Didn't I tell you to stay?
Haven't you hurt me enough?

1017
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,673
Look what you're doing to me!
Get in here!

1018
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:47,870
Why are you doing this to me? Shut up!

1019
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:54,959
Come on in here, Charlie!
Come on into your bedroom, Charlie!

1020
01:32:57,640 --> 01:32:59,471
Lulu!

1021
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:02,955
Stop it, Ray! Stop it!

1022
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,758
Charlie, are you OK?

1023
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,718
Charlie!

1024
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:15,070
- I hate you!
- I hate you too!

1025
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,196
- Lulu!
- Charlie!

1026
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,074
Charlie, come here! I got somethin' for ya!

1027
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:26,590
Why can't you just give me a chance?
Why?! Why?!

1028
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:32,955
Stop it! Stop it!

1029
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,550
No, no...

1030
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:18,913
Oh... Oh, God!

1031
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:28,989
Ray!

1032
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,076
No! No!

1033
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:34,316
No!

1034
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:41,431
I hate you so much! Stop it!

1035
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:43,349
Charlie!

1036
01:34:43,480 --> 01:34:44,595
No, Ray!

1037
01:35:05,640 --> 01:35:07,915
Shit, Charlie.

1038
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:21,796
I understand that the break-in
occurred an hour ago.

1039
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,876
- Yeah.
- Keys.

1040
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,756
He smashed a window to gain entrance

1041
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:31,271
and you were forcibly led into the house,
Mr Driggs, through the back.

1042
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,790
I understand that he manacled you
at that time.

1043
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,070
Mr Driggs, did you know him?

1044
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:39,596
Did you know the guy?

1045
01:36:43,240 --> 01:36:45,435
He was my husband.

1046
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:47,437
Your husband?

1047
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:49,391
Ray Sinclair.

1048
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,670
And what is your name?

1049
01:36:51,800 --> 01:36:53,358
Audrey.

1050
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:56,194
Audrey, you wanna
come with me, please?

1051
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:02,638
Wait.

1052
01:37:03,080 --> 01:37:05,799
You're not...
You're not taking her away because...

1053
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:10,198
It's all right. It's OK, Mr Driggs.
We just need to get more information.

1054
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,556
Charles?

1055
01:38:04,880 --> 01:38:06,598
Larry!

1056
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,551
Hi.

1057
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:13,796
Listen, uh...

1058
01:38:14,920 --> 01:38:17,150
We're all real sorry about your leaving.

1059
01:38:17,280 --> 01:38:18,793
Oh, that's nice.

1060
01:38:18,920 --> 01:38:21,115
There's no way to get you
to change your mind?

1061
01:38:21,240 --> 01:38:23,913
No. Nope, I don't think so, no.

1062
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:28,269
- Is there anything I can do?
- No. Everything's been taken care of.

1063
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,356
Everything's fine.

1064
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:32,672
Well...

1065
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:35,399
Hey!

1066
01:38:42,120 --> 01:38:44,588
How do you figure
a guy like Ray Sinclair?

1067
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:58,757
Well...

1068
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:00,996
Stay in touch. Promise?

1069
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,759
Promise.

1070
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:07,878
Hey, Larry.

1071
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,673
It's better to be a live dog
than a dead lion.

1072
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:14,440
It's been good working with you, Charlie.

1073
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,236
Who is it?

1074
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,958
I'm looking for the woman in 3F.
Lulu is her name, or Audrey.

1075
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,672
I'm in 3F. You must want
the girl that moved out.

1076
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:08,439
Uh... did you talk to her?
I mean, did she say...

1077
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:12,155
Did she say where she was goin',
or a forwarding address or anything?

1078
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,589
No. I moved in, it was empty.

1079
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,676
OK, thanks.

1080
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,110
- Hey!
- Yeah?

1081
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:24,153
- Do you know what her rent was?
- Her rent?

1082
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:28,910
Yeah. This building is rent-stabilised,
but I think the landlord is screwing me.

1083
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:32,875
Yeah, well, it wouldn't surprise me.

1084
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,193
The MP would grab 'em
and confiscate 'em,

1085
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,118
and I'd take 'em back
and I'd sell 'em again.

1086
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:25,474
- Here's your check, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

1087
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,869
Hey! You didn't pay for your food.
Where you think you're goin'?

1088
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:00,475
- Come on, mister. I haven't got all day.
- What?

1089
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:04,912
- You didn't pay for your food.
- Sure I paid, Dottie. I put $5 on the table.

1090
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,598
Do you think I'm stupid?

1091
01:42:06,720 --> 01:42:11,111
Look, it's a mistake. It was a $3.15 bill,
I left $5 on the table. That's a healthy tip.

1092
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:15,950
- Do you expect to eat and not pay?
- All right. It's not that big a deal to me.

1093
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:35,149
- Keep the, uh... keep the change.
- Sure.

1094
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,835
You never said goodbye.

1095
01:42:52,440 --> 01:42:54,715
I never wanted to say goodbye.

1096
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,716
Want a ride?

1097
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,231
Sure, Audrey.

1098
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,112
Why not?
