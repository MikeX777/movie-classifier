1
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,132
We were in Brazil.

2
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:02,636
The night before,
Luciano sang for 200,000 people.

3
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,893
It was an amazing concert in Buenos Aires.

4
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:10,311
The next morning,
we went up the Amazon, into the jungle.

5
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,188
Thankfully, I had my video camera.

6
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,820
There was this theater
in the middle of nowhere,

7
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:19,869
and, uh, I realized this was a pilgrimage.

8
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:23,249
And Luciano said,

9
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,293
"I want to sing on this stage
where Caruso sang 100 years ago."

10
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,298
You know, we had nothing organized.

11
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:39,340
We arrive in front of the theater,
and it was completely locked up.

12
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,514
Nobody was there.

13
00:01:41,685 --> 00:01:44,143
We found somebody, uh, to open it.

14
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:50,232
And somebody came out
and said, uh, "Who is he?"

15
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:54,191
And he said, "I am Luciano Pavarotti."

16
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:53,394
Luciano never had a plan in his mind

17
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,066
and was not somebody
that planned things, you know?

18
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,520
Things just happened.

19
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,368
One day, we receive a video camera.

20
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:09,073
So, I was always there with this camera,
and we shoot everything.

21
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,955
He really trust people.

22
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,959
He always thought
that everybody had a good part, you know?

23
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,584
He was so full of joy
and so happy all the time.

24
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,059
Luciano was completely conscious
of the fact

25
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,353
that he received a great gift from God.

26
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,439
Not just in opera,
but everything else in life.

27
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,902
It gave him purpose.

28
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,364
But it was also a burden.

29
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,872
I always wanted to understand
the reason why.

30
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,448
Our profession
is a very, very particular one.

31
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,652
You don't become well-known in a day.

32
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,828
In this growing, you don't realize
what is going to happen to you.

33
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,956
You don't know who you are, really.

34
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,881
I was born during the war,
so, I am carrying that.

35
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,841
Always.

36
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:34,141
But I was a very lucky boy,

37
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,766
because I was raised
in the most beautiful place.

38
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,399
My father was a baker and a tenor.

39
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,862
I was very lucky
to have my father singing in the church.

40
00:06:56,374 --> 00:07:02,496
Even for a little boy, by imitation,
you always do what your father is doing,

41
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:04,376
so he was my teacher.

42
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,626
It was a fantastic tenor voice.

43
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,927
Phenomenal. Better than mine.
And nobody believed, but he was like that.

44
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:22,065
I was singing with my father
and 50 more male voice.

45
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,232
We went to this place in Wales
to make a competition.

46
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,402
1955, you won first prize in Wales.

47
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,496
Yes.

48
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,574
That was one of the most important
and unforgettable day of my life.

49
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:44,462
And sharing it with all my friends
and with my father.

50
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:53,054
And that time,
I was a teacher for elementary school.

51
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:55,631
My father, he says, "Listen.

52
00:07:56,267 --> 00:08:00,477
Now you study, you go to the city,
and you become professor."

53
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:04,102
Because my father
did not succeed as a tenor.

54
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,560
He knows how difficult it is,
even with a beautiful voice.

55
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,949
And I say,
"Okay, if you say so, I will do that."

56
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,324
My mother says, "No, I think,

57
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:22,330
when I hear my son sing,
I have something in my heart."

58
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,253
Oh, I say, "Mama, you say that
because you are my mother. Come on."

59
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,045
She says, "No, no, no, no.

60
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,840
No, because I don't say that
when I hear your father."

61
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:38,554
She make me do exactly what I want,
and I think for what I was born to do.

62
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,848
So, in 1955, I begin to study,

63
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:48,981
and six year after,
I made my debut in 1961.

64
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,703
So, how did you get
your first part in an opera?

65
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:05,409
I won a competition,

66
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,541
and the prize of the competition
was to sing on the stage

67
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,715
with an orchestra with a conductor
with, uh, the entire performance.

68
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:18,298
And my debut was the 29th of April, 1961,
and I was playing Rodolfo in <i>Bohème.</i>

69
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,711
In <i>La bohème,</i> yeah.

70
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:21,759
It was not a sensational night,

71
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:25,142
but I think everybody was very pleased,
especially my mother.

72
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,529
The 29th of April, 1961,

73
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:10,209
a young elementary school teacher
went on the stage, and he become a tenor.

74
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,166
And I fall in love.

75
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:25,926
We did live together a couple of months.
Really like bohemians.

76
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,602
I remember that we have the room,
one in front of the other,

77
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,395
and the bathroom was there for everybody.

78
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,523
It's love. It's passion.
It's very beautiful. It's casual.

79
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:44,702
It's everything poetic and romantic
and positive in life.

80
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:48,451
And desperate,
because there is... that is there.

81
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,397
London is an incredible city,

82
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:21,606
and Covent Garden is my first
important international theater.

83
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,777
I sang there in 1963 with great success.

84
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,748
Covent Garden was making
ten performance of <i>Bohème.</i>

85
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,994
Performances with Mr. Di Stefano,

86
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,501
who is one of the greatest tenor
of all time.

87
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:41,505
And then, when he is arriving,
he was very sick,

88
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:46,259
and he's canceling the performance,
and I am singing in his place.

89
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,928
And the news was incredible,

90
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,977
because young tenor
will substitute Di Stefano.

91
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:53,929
The work is Di Stefano,

92
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,270
but doesn't matter
because the young tenor was me.

93
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,197
Finally, I am reaching that point

94
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:07,322
in which you are able
to deal with the stage.

95
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:12,081
It's still difficult, but you made it.
So I made it.

96
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,670
It was very early in my career.

97
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,220
I was going to make my debut
in Vienna in '67.

98
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:30,095
And I had been reading
about this new superstar

99
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,394
that was singing
with JJoan Sutherland in a tour.

100
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,559
Going to Australia with Joan,

101
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:40,108
first of all, I learned to be
a very serious professional singer.

102
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:45,152
And from her, particularly,
I learned to breathe,

103
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,530
which is the most simple thing
but the most difficult.

104
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,737
What did you learn? How could you tell
what was going on inside?

105
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:55,791
Well, while singing a duet,
I tried to touch her to see

106
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,665
how she was doing, and...

107
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:01,714
What did you feel?
Could you feel the air?

108
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,586
- I saw the muscle of the diaphragm.
- Yeah.

109
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:09,214
And she use... and how firm the muscle was
before she attack any kind of note.

110
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,675
More than everything,
I think the technique is perfect.

111
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,386
I think it's probably
the most incredible technique

112
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,346
of all the time, I would like to say.

113
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:48,753
I think Luciano has
one of the most ideal voice

114
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:52,681
ever born on this Earth,
at least for a tenor.

115
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,140
Luciano's voice
always went right to my heart.

116
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:03,066
It was just one of the clearest,
most pure, most emotional,

117
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,691
passionate, beautiful... everything.

118
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:09,444
It's just heaven on earth, truly.

119
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,615
It's very important
to make people understand

120
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:22,169
that a soprano and a baritone,
they are the most natural voices.

121
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,339
Men, they are naturally baritones.

122
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:29,715
But to become a tenor,
that's another thing. It's more unnatural.

123
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,647
If you want
to become Luciano Pavarotti,

124
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,606
you must have the high C.

125
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:54,159
That's the most important thing.

126
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:57,784
You can have a beautiful,
nice life of the tenor,

127
00:15:57,874 --> 00:16:01,788
but if you don't have a high C,
no big tenor.

128
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,670
When I was listening to Luciano, you know,

129
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:08,123
he was just opening his mouth,
and here it goes.

130
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,584
Everything... Everything was easy.

131
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:29,896
When he was singing
<i>La fille du régiment,</i>

132
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,106
that was the opera that made him famous.

133
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,697
His famous, you know,
nine high C's in <i>La fille du régiment,</i>

134
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,578
<i>La fille du régiment,</i> uh,
that's, you know, opera history.

135
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,683
I felt like I could see his voice.

136
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:04,059
It was super clear, like a photograph.

137
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:08,893
You can count molecules practically.
It's so clear.

138
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:13,322
A tenor singing a high C
makes your ears vibrate.

139
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:17,656
There's such tension of sound.
My ears would ring.

140
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:41,221
We all dreamed to be
the most important in the operatic world.

141
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:44,804
Luciano was the one and only. Yes.

142
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,233
Luciano was singing
in all the theaters,

143
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,689
Covent Garden, Vienna,
La Scala and Metropolitan,

144
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,111
and many other theaters
all around the world.

145
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,823
All his recordings
became quite legendary.

146
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,532
He was labeled by Decca
as the King of the High C's.

147
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,826
The jump of the horse who can jump...

148
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,630
It's not difficult
if he reach the obstacle

149
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,793
at the right moment, in the right balance.

150
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,094
And it's the same singing the top.

151
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,969
Top is not difficult if you arrive there
prepared to make the top.

152
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,620
Can you be absolutely sure that you'll...

153
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,204
If you've prepared properly,
can you be sure you'll hit the note?

154
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:31,643
No. That is the beauty of my profession.

155
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:38,073
I always say that, uh,
"voice" in Spanish is feminine.

156
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:43,200
It's <i>la voz</i>. Also, in Italian, <i>la voce.</i>
In French, <i>la voix.</i>

157
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:48,375
So, I believe that to live with a voice,

158
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:52,626
she's like a very, very jealous
and demanding woman.

159
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,383
I know I cannot do anything without her,

160
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,910
without the voice.

161
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,676
You live with it, and you have to realize,

162
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,507
and everything affects it.

163
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:08,062
Good news, bad news,
something then it is emotional,

164
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,019
physically, we react.

165
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,687
This muscle...

166
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:16,612
you never know if they respond
to you immediately.

167
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,781
She's the prima donna of my body.

168
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,242
One day's better than another one.

169
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,041
Like in any relationship,
you have to know the person very well

170
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:34,000
in order to really treat
somebody that you love so much

171
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,456
in the best way.

172
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,632
So, that's the voice, you know.
She's a lady.

173
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:14,396
The opera is love, hate, death.

174
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,732
It is very important.

175
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,233
With a little makeup,
you can become another person.

176
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,448
The opera is something fake

177
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,572
that, little by little
on the stage, it become true.

178
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,555
I understand you carry,

179
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,572
of all things,
in your pocket, a bent nail.

180
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,452
A bent nail, yes.

181
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,627
It's a superstition,
and all the artists, I think, have one.

182
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:03,706
Like in English, says, "touch wood,"

183
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:06,291
in Italy, we say, "touch iron."

184
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,923
And we have a bent nail with iron.

185
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:11,046
It's double good luck.

186
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,926
Are you a devout Catholic?

187
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:18,520
I think so, very deeply.
But let's say, then, even being Catholic,

188
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,973
I am still superstitious, just in case.

189
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,715
I think there's no question

190
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,947
Luciano was, at heart, a simple person.

191
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,865
He called himself a peasant.

192
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,739
I think one of the reasons
that the role of Nemorino

193
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:38,119
in <i>L'elisir d'amore</i> was such a natural fit
is that he was a bit of a bumpkin.

194
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,413
He had
thousands of fans around the world.

195
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:26,304
People were queuing around the block
for tickets. They'd kill for them.

196
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,930
Somebody from the record company

197
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,742
said to Luciano,
"Well, you... You're such a nice guy...

198
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:05,870
what you need is a real bastard
to work for you."

199
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,788
That's how we started.

200
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,443
Herbert Breslin had a reputation

201
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,303
as being one of the most hated people
in the opera business.

202
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,761
I had never heard anything good about
Herbert Breslin before I worked for him.

203
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,808
What happened
with Luciano Pavarotti and myself

204
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,564
was a unity of purpose.

205
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,855
He wanted it, and I wanted it.

206
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:39,491
Because, as his reputation was being made,
my reputation was being made.

207
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:47,188
Herbert would also tell you
that he generated

208
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,877
a number of the sort of popularizing ideas
that helped make Luciano what he became.

209
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,876
He'd never done a concert before.

210
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,212
He'd never done a recital before.

211
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,674
I opened up the gates of music to him.

212
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:08,189
My manager sent me out
to Liberty, Missouri

213
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,733
by myself to make a recital.

214
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,284
In opera, you've got the benefit
of a costume and makeup,

215
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,658
and you become another character
during those three hours,

216
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,364
whereas in a recital, you're yourself.

217
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,339
It's only his voice.

218
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,429
You're totally exposed.

219
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,104
You're almost naked because, you know,
you can't hide behind anything.

220
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,850
Luciano said, "Oh, my God,
what am I going to do with my hands?"

221
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,981
His manager said to him,

222
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:55,937
"Take that handkerchief
that's in your pocket

223
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,192
and hold it in your hands."

224
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:09,834
My manager said,
"If you don't like it, don't do it."

225
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,504
And I say, "I don't like. I adore it."

226
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:26,802
We started doing recitals
in rural America.

227
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,729
Places that don't have opera houses.

228
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:41,070
It's a certain way
to give back what God gave to me.

229
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,868
It's not to make myself popular.

230
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,367
It's to make
the world of the opera popular.

231
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,244
He liked to go
to the buffets in the hotels,

232
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,795
and we would each fill up
two or three times

233
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:57,295
and pig out on American food.

234
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,797
Mac and cheese and very non-Italian stuff.

235
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:06,303
What I was able to provide him
was the dynamic of making a star.

236
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,228
<i>Welcome to an historic event:</i>

237
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,556
<i>the first live telecast of an opera</i>

238
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:15,187
<i>from the new Metropolitan Opera House
in Lincoln Center.</i>

239
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:18,816
<i>Tonight's opera is</i> La bohème,
<i>"The Bohemians."</i>

240
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:24,450
Luciano made his debut
at the Met, November of '68,

241
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,326
and it became his artistic home.

242
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,829
So, I think I had
a very close relationship with him

243
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,251
for about 20 years.

244
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,793
I don't think they've ever seen you...
most of them... on television like this.

245
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:40,842
Well, television like that,
I think it was never made.

246
00:28:40,928 --> 00:28:42,197
It is the first time, is it not?

247
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,448
- Is it not the first time?
- Yes.

248
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:46,215
- And, uh...
- Have you done television opera in Europe?

249
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:48,095
- Not live. Uh...
- Okay.

250
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,471
- In studio, yes.
- Uh-huh.

251
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,803
But live, it is the first time.

252
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:53,889
- It is a new experience for me.
- Uh-huh.

253
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:58,022
And, uh, don't ask me if I am happy,
because I am never happy, and, uh...

254
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,214
I'll ask you if you're happy.

255
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,298
- Are you happy?
- I am not.

256
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:01,549
- You're not happy?
- Never. Never happy.

257
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,759
- Never happy? All right.
- Never happy.

258
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:04,866
I always think I can do better than I do.

259
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:07,319
He was a nervous wreck
before every performance.

260
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,074
He would always say, "I go to die."

261
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,531
We go to die.

262
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,746
And he would always
end up living after the performance.

263
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:25,845
You could see the public
was absolutely taking to this man.

264
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:31,259
Because of his smile,
because of his artistry,

265
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:34,016
and because of his personality.

266
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,647
They couldn't get enough of him.

267
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,019
Good morning from Chicago,

268
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,148
where I am pleased to introduce
to a very excited audience,

269
00:29:41,238 --> 00:29:42,649
Luciano Pavarotti.

270
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,234
Luciano, you know, loved pasta.

271
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:51,446
He'd come to our apartment for dinner,
and he'd want to cook.

272
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:53,949
Garlic, sliced.

273
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,454
- All that?
- Yes.

274
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,957
Going to be fantastic.

275
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,583
Olive oil.

276
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,209
Red pepper.

277
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,589
You're serious now?

278
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,362
- I am very serious.
- All right, all right.

279
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:05,547
You will cry later, probably.

280
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,253
When you taste.

281
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,967
When he was in New York, he would
always cook this spicy spaghetti for me.

282
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,926
- He didn't like Indian food too much.
- Mmm.

283
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:17,514
Mr. Pavarotti, on the road,
do you like to have a hotel room with a...

284
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,143
What?

285
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,498
...with a kitchen?
Isn't that right? You...

286
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:26,360
It's pretty common, I think,
for big international stars

287
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,986
to try to take their home with them,

288
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,783
because you're just always
in a hotel room.

289
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:08,357
Not being home, not being with his family,
he led a lonely life.

290
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,198
And that's why, I think,
he had the big entourage all the time.

291
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,200
And the after-performances,
all the people going to dinner.

292
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,623
- Can we agree, sir, that it is fattening?
- Hmm.

293
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,770
No doubt about that.

294
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,335
One day, he says,
"Now, this is how you lose weight.

295
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:26,090
First, we have chicken,
beans and mashed potatoes.

296
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:30,216
And after that, we then have
four scoops of vanilla ice cream."

297
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,759
And he eats quickly his three scoops,

298
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,888
and he pushes the plate away,
leaving a scoop.

299
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:40,555
He said, "Now, that's the diet.
You don't eat the last scoop.

300
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,644
I guarantee you, you'll lose weight."

301
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,941
That was his diet.

302
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:46,982
He absolutely hated being alone.

303
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,564
For somebody who was so big and famous,

304
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:52,492
he was extremely vulnerable
in so many ways.

305
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,285
He had a lot of nerves,

306
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:58,536
and I think the audience
could connect with that.

307
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,285
What am I? Am I successful,
or am I just famous?

308
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,086
That, I don't know. I don't care.

309
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:08,374
I know that people
recognize me on the street. Very good.

310
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,961
But I have three daughters and one wife,

311
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,547
and when I am at home,
I know exactly who I am.

312
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,801
Nothing. Exactly zero.

313
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:20,724
But I am happy.

314
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:25,604
<i>Even successful nothings
carry the American Express Card.</i>

315
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,480
The American Express commercial
paid $10,000, which is chicken feed.

316
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,782
But it didn't matter.
It was all over the place.

317
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:33,949
And do you know me?

318
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,028
Well, if you didn't know me,
you'd know him pretty soon.

319
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:39,576
Would you welcome, please,
Luciano Pavarotti?

320
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,077
<i>Luciano Pavarotti.</i>

321
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:43,785
- <i>Luciano Pavarotti.
- Luciano Pavarotti.</i>

322
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,927
Welcome...

323
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,924
to this afternoon's special class

324
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:57,970
with Mr. Pavarotti and the students
of the Juilliard Voice Department.

325
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,266
Luciano Pavarotti.

326
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:05,390
Before I met Luciano,
I had no idea who he was.

327
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,020
I should be embarrassed to say that.

328
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,397
I was already
in my second year at Juilliard.

329
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,855
He was doing a master class.

330
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,736
Master class.

331
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,948
The word by itself already scare me.

332
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,656
I am very, very nervous.

333
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,917
It's a daunting experience,

334
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,872
but Luciano was very good
at putting people at ease.

335
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,923
And especially in front of an audience.

336
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:02,906
He was already a maestro
listening to younger singers

337
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:07,209
and, you know, knowing the repertoire
and knowing the vocal difficulties

338
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:11,088
and being able to say something
to make it better.

339
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,461
Wow. Beautiful voice.

340
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:19,469
I think, for your voice, you should
take the tempo just a little quick.

341
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,140
<i>Un poco più veloce.</i>

342
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,515
Doesn't matter what the piano play,
what the orchestra play,

343
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,561
with the right tempo, for everybody.

344
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:28,689
Can you try the beginning, please?

345
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:33,728
I always knew I wanted to sing
from the time I was young,

346
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:37,907
and I had studied Italian
and lived in France when I was little,

347
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:39,404
so I had several languages.

348
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:43,745
Luciano, he needed somebody
to answer his phones

349
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,949
and somebody to answer his fan mail.

350
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:50,252
He said, "If you help me out,
I will work with your voice."

351
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,173
He loved teaching.
That's what maestro is. He's a teacher.

352
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,421
He had great teachers as a young person,

353
00:34:56,511 --> 00:35:00,721
and he was very, very technically educated
as a tenor student.

354
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,516
When I was a kid,
I gave up everything.

355
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,724
I begin to go to bed early every night.

356
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:09,772
I try with all my power,
studying the singing,

357
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,350
and become a more serious student.

358
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,234
I'd have two teachers.

359
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:17,029
One was a tenor,
and he give me vocal ways.

360
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,404
And the second one
is a very, very famous teacher,

361
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:24,237
and he was more about the phrasing,
the music.

362
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:29,121
Technique was everything to him.
Technique and language meant so much.

363
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:36,132
When studying our profession,
Italian opera is the base for opera.

364
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,097
First, we have the words.

365
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:51,056
The composer, he has the words,
and then he put the notes.

366
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,984
The composers, they are based
on the meaning of the word.

367
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,780
It's the most important
to understand how to...

368
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:03,360
to share that emotion
from that particular word with the public.

369
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:21,966
Composers like Mozart, Verdi, Donizetti,
they use the language.

370
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,261
So, if you pronounce it well,
you get the rhythm immediately,

371
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,183
'cause the rhythm is in the music, too.

372
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,448
It's about breathing.
Controlling your diaphragm.

373
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:46,995
Taking your air in,
and you're the one that decides

374
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,290
where your air goes, how it goes out,
how long your phrase is.

375
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,743
As Luciano used to say...

376
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,373
You measure your breath.

377
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:09,391
It's how you coordinate
everything with feelings.

378
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:14,268
With expression, you know?
With temperament. With joy.

379
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:19,902
The public, they don't know
what are you doing, but they feel it.

380
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,091
- Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

381
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,003
If you just have, singing,

382
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:50,049
a quarter of the beauty voice
you have speaking, my dear,

383
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,623
you would be yourself a great singer.

384
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,678
- Oh, thank you very much.
- I'm sure.

385
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,875
- Beautiful voice.
- You sly dog, you.

386
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,562
You go right to the ladies, you see?
Right to the ladies.

387
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,988
I saw you before.

388
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:11,033
Luciano was mischievous.
He had... How would I say? <i>Monello.</i>

389
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,738
That would be the word I would use.

390
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:16,576
It's an Italian word for,
you know, like a schoolboy sense of humor.

391
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:21,004
He would take delight in the little
funny things, you know? The stupid things.

392
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,380
Mr. Pavarotti, speaking on behalf
of all the ladies in the audience,

393
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,259
we should like you to know
that we love large men,

394
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,887
and particularly...

395
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,644
Especially large men with large voices.

396
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,321
Do you think
that your huggable extra inches

397
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:49,241
helps to produce that beautiful resonance?

398
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,534
I think so.

399
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,173
When I was born in this building,

400
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:15,510
it was already six year
that a boy was not born.

401
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,355
So I was the first boy after six years

402
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:24,230
born in a house with 15 family,
100 people.

403
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:29,737
My mother embraced me,
and with all the women of this house,

404
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:31,613
I was the Lucianino.

405
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,160
Everybody was looking for me.

406
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:40,327
I was very much spoiled, loved,
but even... kept smart.

407
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:46,173
I think Luciano loved women.
And he also trusted them.

408
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:51,671
He was brought up by women.
He had aunties, his mum.

409
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,933
And, of course, with Adua,
he had three daughters.

410
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:01,181
And then Alice and Nicoletta.
He definitely had an affinity for women.

411
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,059
And I think, the bossier we were,
the more he argued with us,

412
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,315
but the more he trusted us
as well, I think.

413
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:13,868
I was accompanying him
on all his tours all over the place.

414
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,036
I remember he had 28 suitcases.

415
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,659
You know, Luciano never packed
a suitcase in his life.

416
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:22,543
He was very demanding.

417
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,838
God forbid his handkerchiefs
weren't where they were supposed to be.

418
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,711
You know, I mean,
it was difficult at times.

419
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,802
I had to take care of his schedule,
who he was supposed to meet,

420
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,053
when his rehearsals were,
and I was singing with him.

421
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,852
The relationship was so all-encompassing

422
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:44,649
because I was the friend,
the student, the secretary.

423
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:48,311
He was my mentor,
my teacher, my... my love.

424
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:55,026
I never thought that I would end up
in a relationship with Luciano.

425
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:59,493
But it was hard to see
where to draw a line.

426
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,751
I remember a recital, and I was backstage,

427
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,251
you know, holding his water
and his hot tea or whatever,

428
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,902
and all of a sudden, it's like, you know,

429
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:13,761
he dragged me out on the stage
to sing <i>La bohème,</i> the duet.

430
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,874
Luciano always said
there are no great teachers

431
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,417
or no great students.

432
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,540
It's the meeting of the two, together.

433
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,546
One of the execs in my office

434
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,834
came to me and showed me an article

435
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,504
that the maestro
had just sold out Madison Square Garden.

436
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,129
And I thought,
"Hmm. That looks interesting."

437
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:39,256
Most of my life at that point
was based around rock and roll concerts.

438
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,929
I had just booked six nights
at Earls Court for Bruce Springsteen

439
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:47,263
and paid the deposit.

440
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:49,773
And then I got a phone call

441
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:51,942
from Bruce's manager to say

442
00:42:52,028 --> 00:42:54,896
that Bruce doesn't want to do
an arena in London.

443
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,448
So I was stuck.
I was in for half a million pounds.

444
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,821
So I set about everybody in my office

445
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:03,495
looking for an alternative
to put into Earls Court.

446
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,789
And then this chap came into my office

447
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:09,334
and showed me this article,
and I just said, "Get him."

448
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,705
Herbert Breslin.

449
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:19,007
So we tracked down
Herbert Breslin, who was his manager,

450
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:21,555
who refused point-blank to speak to me.

451
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:29,810
And he said, "Why on earth would I
want to talk to a rock and roll promoter?"

452
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:32,482
And he kind of emphasized
the "rock" and the "roll."

453
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:37,359
And I said, "I don't know, really.
I produce concerts. I'm quite good at it."

454
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,155
I kept faxing over offers,

455
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:51,461
till the point where the offer was so good
that he finally picked the phone up

456
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:53,538
and he said, "Can we meet?"

457
00:43:56,259 --> 00:44:00,720
So I arranged a lunch in my office.
We sat down, we started talking,

458
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:05,641
and I realized very early on
that Breslin was a diva.

459
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,137
Was a real diva.

460
00:44:07,854 --> 00:44:10,312
But Pavarotti was different.

461
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:17,069
The first concert that we put on together,
I took my parents backstage,

462
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,646
and they were so excited to meet him.

463
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,356
And he literally chucked everybody
out of the dressing room.

464
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,370
My mother came out just streaming tears.

465
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:29,656
And I thought, "Oh, my God,
what's happened?"

466
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:36,209
He had sat my mum and dad down,
and sang an aria to them.

467
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:49,305
They told me what happened.
I was quite taken aback, to be honest.

468
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:56,693
He had this knack above any other person
I'd ever met in my life

469
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,690
of making people feel he was their friend,

470
00:45:00,615 --> 00:45:02,356
that they were special.

471
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:28,827
What time is it, please?

472
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:14,196
It was a miracle, no doubt.

473
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,582
From that day, just say, "My dear,

474
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,376
the life is the most important
thing you have.

475
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,374
Let's start again."

476
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,638
About that time, I worked for PolyGram,

477
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,566
which was one of the biggest
record companies in the world.

478
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,813
And we bought Decca Records.

479
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:47,779
And Pavarotti
was one of their biggest assets.

480
00:47:51,327 --> 00:47:53,239
Almost immediately, we found out

481
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,491
that Pavarotti had been recording
for someone else

482
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,949
while he was under a huge contract
exclusively to Decca.

483
00:47:59,043 --> 00:48:01,410
And I was told to go and tell him off.

484
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:07,420
I was a nothing little pip-squeak
in the company,

485
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,844
and it was also my first meeting
with the maestro.

486
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,492
So I went to his room at the Savoy
and knocked on the door,

487
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,849
and he said, "Oh, come in. Sit down."

488
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,642
It was obviously quite intimidating.

489
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,055
So I said,
"Maestro, I've come to tell you off."

490
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,436
And he said, "What, what?
Why? What, what?"

491
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,611
I said, "Well, have you been recording
for someone else?"

492
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:32,066
And he said, "Yes, yes, my wife's company.
I make wonderful records for them."

493
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,151
I said,
"Well, look, you're not allowed to."

494
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,157
He said,
"What do you mean, 'not allowed to?'"

495
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:39,911
I said,
"Because you are under exclusive contract,

496
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,493
and you are only, only allowed to record

497
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,267
for the Decca record company,
no one else."

498
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,292
"So, this is the meaning of 'exclusive'?"

499
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:53,879
I said, "Yes, that is exclusive.
Yes, you cannot do it. You must not."

500
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,803
"Ah," he said. "Life is too short."

501
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,260
So I went back to the office,

502
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,062
and they were all desperate to know
what the maestro had said.

503
00:49:03,149 --> 00:49:05,766
"What did he say?" I said,
"Well, he said, 'Life's too short.'"

504
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,813
"What did you say?" I said,

505
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,343
"Well, I couldn't think of anything to say
'cause he's right."

506
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:14,654
So, we went
and we bought his wife's company

507
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:15,950
for a modest amount of money,

508
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,278
and he was happy, his wife was happy,
everyone was happy.

509
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,582
It was a life lesson.

510
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,956
Those people that infect you

511
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:29,414
with understanding the difference
between a business life

512
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,591
and a human life are rare.

513
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,372
During the '80s, he started working

514
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:54,315
with a Hungarian promoter, Tibor Rudas,
and things just got bigger.

515
00:49:57,745 --> 00:50:02,911
I was the vice president of
the first casino opened in Atlantic City.

516
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,367
I built a theater for them, and I used

517
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:10,172
practically every contemporary artist
known in the United States.

518
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,793
Sinatra. Diana Ross. Anybody.

519
00:50:16,805 --> 00:50:20,094
It was funny because
the manager was actually Herbert Breslin,

520
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,891
and Herbert wouldn't let you do anything.

521
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,435
And then Tibor Rudas
took him out into the arenas,

522
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,434
and he wanted him to do everything.

523
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:41,111
Tibor made a career with Luciano,
taking him into stadiums,

524
00:50:41,205 --> 00:50:42,867
various capitals of the world.

525
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:55,042
Suddenly, in between my relationship
which was just beginning with Breslin,

526
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,718
I get a phone call from Tibor Rudas.

527
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:01,139
He said, "Anything you do from here on in,
you work for me, got it?"

528
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,387
I said, "Okay."

529
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,937
Once Tibor got in the picture,
the whole financial picture changed.

530
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:20,033
That was certainly an important point
in the development of Luciano's career.

531
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:21,655
He was branching out.

532
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,447
Everything became more geared
towards mass appeal.

533
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:31,253
It's important to remember
that there's a huge tradition

534
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:35,173
of opera stars
as huge popular entertainers.

535
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:38,093
The opera stars of their day
were the movie stars of today.

536
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,044
There's an exact link.

537
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,847
And so Pavarotti
is picking up on a tradition

538
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,425
that's very much embodied
by Enrico Caruso, say,

539
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:49,229
who was the first and one of
the greatest recording stars of all time.

540
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:08,453
Caruso was this unbelievably,
globally popular tenor

541
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,660
who would attract
hundreds of thousands of people

542
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,916
wherever he went,
just to catch a glimpse of him,

543
00:52:14,006 --> 00:52:15,838
forget about seeing him perform.

544
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,505
Pavarotti was the kind of
Caruso of his age.

545
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,424
And finally this evening, opera in China.

546
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:30,308
The great Italian tenor, Pavarotti.
ABC's Jim Laurie is in Beijing.

547
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,649
The Western Opera Company
had never been to China.

548
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:37,819
Enter the imposing figure
of Luciano Pavarotti

549
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,862
in his first tour of China.

550
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,531
Three weeks in which
to embrace the Chinese.

551
00:52:43,035 --> 00:52:46,824
I am very happy to be here.
For all of us, it is completely new.

552
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:51,375
And I hope especially that the public
is going to enjoy it.

553
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:54,624
Mao Zedong had departed from the scene

554
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,626
not much before we went to China.

555
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:03,053
And Luciano took the full opera company,
a press crew and everybody.

556
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:07,633
The Chinese did not have
a classical music tradition.

557
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,846
It was totally foreign to their culture.

558
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:28,996
I was a little kid,
and here comes this wonderful Italian guy,

559
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:32,370
pretty big guy,
but with the most beautiful smile.

560
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:34,200
I would say, uh, Pavarotti,

561
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,379
when he smiles
with this white handkerchief,

562
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:39,922
the whole world opens for him.

563
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,884
Pavarotti, before his visit,

564
00:53:47,975 --> 00:53:50,467
we know who he is, but...

565
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,804
we don't know so much about opera.

566
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,899
He certainly gave the Chinese audience

567
00:53:57,985 --> 00:54:02,275
their first inspiration
on how to understand opera.

568
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,652
Huh?

569
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,533
In 1986, in China, I had just turned 30.

570
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:59,461
Luciano was still married,

571
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:03,506
and I knew that I had to make a break
from my relationship with Luciano.

572
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:07,335
So I did make a break.

573
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,433
It was a painful moment for me.
It was a painful moment for him.

574
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:20,690
I did not speak to Luciano for years
after I went my own way.

575
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,320
At that time, the late 1980s,

576
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:30,741
Pavarotti is the single most recognizable
operatic figure of the last 50 years.

577
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:36,114
But, over the course
of the next few years,

578
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,326
Luciano wasn't focused
on the opera anymore.

579
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,272
From my perspective,
it was a picture of somebody

580
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,458
who was a little bewildered, I think.

581
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,211
And had a big monkey on his back,

582
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,588
in terms of a big career
and a lot of responsibilities

583
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:51,171
and not a lot of clarity
about where he was going with it.

584
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,805
Everything was really very difficult,

585
00:55:56,270 --> 00:56:00,765
but I still have to go on the stage
to act for the night for the public.

586
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:06,228
I am putting the white makeup
of the clown on the face.

587
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:12,030
I watch myself in the mirror,
and I say, "It is the life.

588
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:15,070
You have to go out.

589
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:20,664
You have to laugh,
even if you have the death in your heart.

590
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:24,041
You have to try to enjoy
the people like every night."

591
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:40,447
How can you stay in front of an audience

592
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,283
and say something
if you don't believe in it?

593
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:49,919
There is no bluff in this profession.
This is not a poker game.

594
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,624
It is a chess game.

595
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,961
And if you lose,
you don't have any excuse.

596
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:16,196
José was a very young tenor,
and the doctors say that he has leukemia.

597
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,911
And he was one year out of the stage.

598
00:58:21,248 --> 00:58:24,116
<i>José Carreras,
one of the world's most popular singers,</i>

599
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:27,919
<i>spent ten months undergoing
intensive treatment in Barcelona</i>

600
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,962
<i>and in a specialist clinic in Seattle.</i>

601
00:58:30,841 --> 00:58:34,551
Luciano called me
in my hospital in Seattle.

602
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,219
"Teacher..." He always
called me always "teacher."

603
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:40,639
"Teacher, how are you doing?
Get well soon.

604
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,467
I don't have competition otherwise."

605
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:48,564
After that, I had the idea,
maybe we could do a concert

606
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,734
that, uh, puts me back onstage.

607
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:01,069
In those days, the three of us
used to live in the same building

608
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:05,703
in Central Park South,
and we had a common friend.

609
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,827
He came to Luciano and me and said,

610
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,663
"What would you feel of doing
a concert with JJosé?"

611
00:59:12,424 --> 00:59:16,464
The idea was that, since all three tenors
really love football

612
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:19,261
and the World Cup
was going on at the same time,

613
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:23,466
to get them there at the eve
of the finals, they will all agree.

614
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,349
<i>July in Rome is the scene
of an historic concert.</i>

615
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:30,523
<i>Three of the world's greatest tenors
on the same stage for the first time:</i>

616
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,976
<i>Luciano Pavarotti, Plácido Domingo</i>

617
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,312
<i>and the recently critically ill
José Carreras.</i>

618
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,067
I feel... It's almost...
The feeling is that, eh?

619
00:59:41,161 --> 00:59:42,161
Yeah.

620
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,579
I thought they will have arguments
who will sing which aria.

621
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:47,406
There's so much repertoire.

622
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,039
So we all rehearsed it on the spot.

623
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:02,426
One of us suggested,
"Why don't you do this one and I do that?"

624
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:05,054
And there was no... no... no argument ever.

625
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:14,938
So, we divide some of the numbers.

626
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:18,521
So, to pick, you know,
between the saddest and so and so.

627
01:00:51,982 --> 01:00:54,645
I think a good way
to know a person

628
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,566
is sharing the stage with him.

629
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:59,942
You know what kind of determination,
you know what kind of fears

630
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:03,365
he's bringing to every performance.

631
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:34,222
Uh, the moment of being on the stage,

632
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,103
there was the competition.

633
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:39,186
It was okay, like,
"Anything you do, I can do better."

634
01:02:07,891 --> 01:02:11,760
That feeling was
in the spirit of the moment, you know?

635
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:15,722
"Boy, what a phrase you did.
Now let me do this one."

636
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:38,786
It was fantastic in the artistic side,

637
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,339
but in the personal side,
believe me, it was even better.

638
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:21,246
We were going to leave Luciano
to sing "Nessun dorma"

639
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,331
because it was his signature aria.

640
01:03:24,968 --> 01:03:28,052
But, uh, we end the program,

641
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,427
and we don't have more music,
and we don't know what to do,

642
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:37,228
and I say to Luciano, "Why we don't do
the 'Nessun dorma' the three together?"

643
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,272
And we did this version,

644
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,226
which is something
that was, uh, very special.

645
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:50,312
It's kind of hard
to overstate what an impact that had.

646
01:05:50,405 --> 01:05:52,317
It was like a tidal wave.

647
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:04,325
The Three Tenors transformed three guys
into the biggest band in the world.

648
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,860
All of a sudden, classical departments

649
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:13,046
were the hottest departments
in the record business.

650
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,768
Rudas took on the Three Tenors,
you know, worldwide.

651
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,345
Also, things catapulted after that.

652
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,978
By this point,
Breslin was already sidelined.

653
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:34,779
Rudas was the Svengali behind all of it.

654
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:40,487
Pavarotti became the global rock star.

655
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,163
Cut above anybody else.

656
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:52,836
There were a number of times
when he was difficult.

657
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,134
He had his moments, kicking and screaming,

658
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,031
"I don't want to perform,"
and all the rest of it.

659
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,493
Please, please, please, please, please.

660
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:02,161
Just make my part.

661
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:03,185
Okay.

662
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:20,485
We'd had a very infamous
kind of hurricane in London,

663
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,570
where a lot of trees were blown down.

664
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:25,748
I went to see the Royal Parks Authority

665
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:29,543
and said, "We would love to do
a concert with Pavarotti."

666
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:33,293
And I suggested
that we raise a sum of money

667
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,797
towards planting trees to replace
the trees that have been knocked down,

668
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:38,405
which, of course, went down brilliantly.

669
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:39,429
They loved it.

670
01:07:39,514 --> 01:07:42,348
Luciano Pavarotti,
seen here planting a tree

671
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:45,141
for the Prince of Wales'
Royal Parks Tree Appeal.

672
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:48,183
This evening,
the Prince and Princess Diana

673
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:51,766
will join an estimated 250,000 people

674
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:56,229
to celebrate the 30th anniversary
of Pavarotti's professional debut.

675
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:59,941
A lot of the Royal Family came.
Most of the cabinet came.

676
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,367
So it was a pretty star-studded event.

677
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:08,616
The day of the concert,
I open the window, and it's raining.

678
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:12,829
And I say to my agent, "Let's go home,"
because nobody's going to come.

679
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:20,260
It was like somebody was throwing
buckets of water just down from the sky,

680
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,928
and it just never stopped.

681
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:24,493
Well, we are in England,

682
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,850
so, of course,
it was umbrellas everywhere.

683
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:33,391
The maestro got to the second aria.

684
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:36,318
People were holding up their umbrellas.
People behind couldn't see.

685
01:08:36,404 --> 01:08:39,397
They were shouting,
and there was this noise going on.

686
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:44,702
I literally rushed onstage,
grabbed the microphone, and I just said...

687
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:57,582
And the first person to jump up
was Princess Diana,

688
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:00,167
who had a guy behind
standing with an umbrella.

689
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,572
She said, "Take the umbrella down."

690
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,714
And there was this ripple effect
all the way back through the audience.

691
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,434
Everybody put their umbrellas down,
and the concert carried on.

692
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:12,225
The next aria...

693
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:15,979
the next aria is from the same opera
that I have sung now, <i>Manon.</i>

694
01:09:17,153 --> 01:09:22,148
The title of the aria
is "Donna non vidi mai."

695
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:25,951
This mean, "I have never seen
a woman like that."

696
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,745
And with your permission,

697
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,536
I would like to dedicate to Lady Diana.

698
01:10:19,799 --> 01:10:23,042
It was something magical,
that connection between the two of them.

699
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,586
Like it was out of a fairy tale.

700
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,534
I brought Princess Diana backstage.

701
01:10:57,879 --> 01:11:01,043
They were kind of giggling,
the pair of them. It was really funny.

702
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,547
The Royal Family, they may attend events,

703
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,798
but they don't normally
come to dinners afterwards.

704
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:11,716
But I invited Princess Diana
to come along,

705
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,472
and much to everybody's amazement,
she said yes.

706
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:24,103
At dinner, the maestro
sat next to Princess Diana,

707
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:25,654
and they just hit it off famously.

708
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,532
They became really, really good friends,

709
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,785
and they both had
a wicked sense of humor as well.

710
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:38,395
They agreed to do things together,

711
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:41,503
and subsequently, we did another concert
for the Red Cross.

712
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,862
All of a sudden,
it was less about him as a singer

713
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:49,003
and more about charity.

714
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:55,801
His focus changed.
He was always generous,

715
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:59,730
but he became completely obsessed
by what he could do for others.

716
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,507
He wouldn't just put money into a charity.

717
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:09,774
He wanted to know that it was building
a school or a health center.

718
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:12,909
Always around children in the communities.

719
01:12:14,163 --> 01:12:16,325
That goodness resonated out of him.

720
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,750
And it's almost like,

721
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:21,794
"I've reached a stage in my career
where this is what I'm able to do now."

722
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:29,760
The tears of Luciano Pavarotti.
An emotion never felt onstage before.

723
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,088
But the place where he performed
without a script,

724
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:36,016
libretto or his big tenor voice
today is an unusual stage:

725
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,344
the center for bone marrow transplant
at Pesaro.

726
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:43,057
Pavarotti is surrounded by
many children from all over the world,

727
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:45,563
and here they've ended
a long journey towards hope.

728
01:12:45,653 --> 01:12:47,653
Here they've managed to defeat
a rare blood disease

729
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,235
with a transplant
that has made the center of Pesaro

730
01:12:50,324 --> 01:12:51,906
one of the most qualified in the world.

731
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,701
Pavarotti's visit coincides
with the delivery

732
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,495
of a check for $300,000 to the foundation.

733
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:02,159
This is the first act of a project
that will be followed by a charity concert

734
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,586
given for Pavarotti International
in Modena.

735
01:13:06,632 --> 01:13:10,251
One afternoon, I get a phone call
from Rudas, and he said,

736
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:14,008
"So, Pavarotti's gonna have
all you rock people playing with him

737
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:16,761
in his farm in Modena,
and you're going to pay for it."

738
01:13:16,851 --> 01:13:19,468
Plunk. Hello?

739
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,724
Rudas called back and said,
"He wants to do a concert.

740
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:29,437
Not my idea. It's your world.
You deal with it. You pay for it."

741
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:31,522
I said, "What are you talking about?"

742
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:38,446
We make a charity
with pop singer in Modena.

743
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:42,203
I always found myself
very happy to do this thing.

744
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,878
He took ownership
of this one charity concert every year.

745
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:04,471
He would turn up on the day,
not quite sure who was gonna be there.

746
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,169
And I think
they sometimes didn't know

747
01:14:07,193 --> 01:14:10,357
who was flying in the night before,
were there any rehearsals.

748
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:12,487
And it would never start on time.

749
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,273
But it always had
something magic about it.

750
01:14:16,202 --> 01:14:18,239
For me, it was very difficult

751
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:22,824
'cause I can't say pop
and opera singer in the same time.

752
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:24,408
No. Never.

753
01:14:48,734 --> 01:14:52,273
Luciano wasn't focused
on the opera anymore at that point,

754
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:54,049
and there were critics around
who were shocked,

755
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,156
and the opera world was kind of left cold.

756
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,451
I received some criticism
from people then.

757
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:02,245
Probably they don't understand,

758
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:06,120
or probably they want to put
a dagger in my body.

759
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:10,045
And, uh, I'm telling you
with all my power, I don't care.

760
01:15:11,716 --> 01:15:14,584
Pavarotti & Friends concerts
every year became,

761
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,669
you know, far more important in his life.

762
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:20,135
And after the first time,
Nicoletta came on the scene.

763
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,730
The first day we met
actually was here,

764
01:15:28,816 --> 01:15:30,102
practically where we are now.

765
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:36,314
I was very young. I was, like, 23,
and I was studying natural science.

766
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,450
And, uh, like most of the students,
during summertime,

767
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,279
I was always looking
for little jobs around, you know,

768
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,988
to try to pay for school.

769
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,355
Nicoletta worked at the horse show,

770
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,541
and she knew nothing about opera.

771
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,278
I don't think
she particularly liked opera,

772
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:59,466
but the chemistry between them was magical
right from the beginning.

773
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:03,785
Luciano, since the beginning,

774
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:07,723
told me that the previous relation
was finished, since long time.

775
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,684
So I never felt guilty, you know?

776
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,643
I never felt it to be
the reason of something.

777
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:20,031
At the beginning, we told everybody
that I was the assistant.

778
01:16:20,618 --> 01:16:22,780
But, um, that was not true.

779
01:16:23,662 --> 01:16:28,782
It's not easy to say I have a relation
with a man 34 years older.

780
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,876
The attack was strong.

781
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,214
But Luciano was my great defender,
you know?

782
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:39,043
He was always protecting me.

783
01:16:41,138 --> 01:16:43,846
Not much after we were together,

784
01:16:43,933 --> 01:16:46,767
I found out to be sick
of multiple sclerosis.

785
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:54,767
And that was, uh,
a very difficult moment for us.

786
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:56,861
I realized, I said,

787
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:59,689
"You know, I don't think
I can be with you anymore."

788
01:17:02,284 --> 01:17:05,072
And he was incredible,
because he said something

789
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,620
that really brought me tears even now.

790
01:17:07,706 --> 01:17:08,742
He said, "You know...

791
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:13,327
until now, I loved you,
but from now on, I adore you."

792
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,553
"We will be together,
and we will fight the sickness."

793
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:31,470
And I think this is what love does,
you know... makes you feel better.

794
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:37,582
He said, "You know,
you have to watch your sickness now,

795
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,207
like an opportunity.

796
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,631
Not like something bad
that happened to you."

797
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:45,377
And I think he got his vision of life
when he was very young.

798
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:49,301
After the war, when he was 12 years old,

799
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,429
he had a form of tetanus
from playing outside.

800
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:54,514
And he almost died.

801
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,358
I was in coma for two weeks.

802
01:19:00,444 --> 01:19:04,108
And I always hear the people
that they come to visit me,

803
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:06,030
and they say, "Well, the priest arrived."

804
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,657
It was the reason
that I am an optimistic person.

805
01:19:12,289 --> 01:19:15,453
Because, when you come out
from something like that,

806
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:18,455
you are definitely a survivor.

807
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:27,295
Somebody would just say
to himself in this dramatic moment,

808
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:31,177
if I just say,
"I'm going to make it. I will enjoy life.

809
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:36,262
I will enjoy the sun, the sky,
the tree, everything."

810
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:41,441
Luciano said,
"Now, when you see a sunset,

811
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,814
you really feel the sunset inside of you."

812
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,112
And he was right,

813
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:53,991
because even the perception
of the important things in life change.

814
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,161
You stop making drama for little things,
you know?

815
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,709
Because, you know that the real drama
is something else.

816
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,914
You understand that you need to feel it
and to live it, you know?

817
01:20:13,559 --> 01:20:15,642
Nicoletta is an extremely bright person,

818
01:20:15,728 --> 01:20:17,469
and she just got on with it.

819
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:20,977
And she became very, very instrumental
in Pavarotti & Friends.

820
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:26,152
After the second concert,

821
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:29,151
Luciano invited a lot of musicians
from the pop world.

822
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,117
But I want to make it bigger, you know?

823
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:36,537
So I started from the band
I like most in my life.

824
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:49,627
Luciano started to call my home in Dublin.

825
01:20:51,472 --> 01:20:53,680
<i>Hello? I'm Mr. Pavarotti.</i>

826
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:56,891
You have Luciano Pavarotti,

827
01:20:56,977 --> 01:20:59,720
the greatest singer on Earth,
maybe who ever existed,

828
01:20:59,813 --> 01:21:03,102
calling you at home
to try and get us to write a song.

829
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:06,355
We called Bono for ages.

830
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:11,031
He became friend of the housekeeper
of Bono because she was Italian.

831
01:21:12,534 --> 01:21:15,151
Our housekeeper, Theresa,
he just got to know her.

832
01:21:16,455 --> 01:21:18,287
He'd ring and say, "Is God at home?"

833
01:21:18,916 --> 01:21:21,329
The technique was one of humility,

834
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:24,745
which is, of course,
a very mischievous trick.

835
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:31,001
He had turned our housekeeper
into his consigliere.

836
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:34,887
Because, at breakfast, dinner and tea,
she was like,

837
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,680
"Have you got that song done for him?"

838
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:39,976
Bono said, "I... I don't have a song.
I have no idea."

839
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:43,555
And Luciano said, "God will inspire you."

840
01:21:46,777 --> 01:21:48,689
I remember it was Easter coming up,

841
01:21:48,779 --> 01:21:52,147
and he said,
"Ah, God will sing him something."

842
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,990
And I woke up with the melody.

843
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:58,490
I mean, it really did happen like that.

844
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:02,825
My father put a love of opera in me,
for sure,

845
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:07,754
so I just imagined it was my father, Bob,

846
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:10,082
singing in the shower.

847
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:15,174
And then Edge came in,
his father being a tenor also.

848
01:22:15,889 --> 01:22:18,256
And he said, "Yeah,
but he'll want a higher note to hit."

849
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:22,390
After we wrote the song
and recorded the song,

850
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,439
we thought it would be the end of this,
you know, just to give him the song.

851
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:28,976
Oh, no, just the start.

852
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:33,905
He then started to petition
our housekeeper, Theresa,

853
01:22:33,991 --> 01:22:37,029
"We need them in Modena.
They now have to play the song."

854
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,236
And I explained,
we definitely couldn't play Modena.

855
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:41,729
The band couldn't do it.
We were in the studio at the moment.

856
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,825
And before I could say no,

857
01:22:44,918 --> 01:22:47,285
he said, "Well, look,
I'm on my way to the studio."

858
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:52,340
And I said, "No, we're in Dublin."
He says, "I am in Dublin."

859
01:22:58,682 --> 01:23:00,264
So, there's a knock at the door.

860
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:04,936
He arrives with a fucking... camera crew

861
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:09,145
to say, "Now you can tell the people
that you're coming."

862
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:13,028
How could you say no to that?
You couldn't. He knew that.

863
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,655
Welcome to Dublin.

864
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:17,903
- Thank you.
- And this is Brian.

865
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:19,053
- Brian Eno.
- Hello, Brian.

866
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,263
- Hi. We met.
<i>- Ciao.</i>

867
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,199
We met already.

868
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:25,453
Is it true that,
uh, this song about Sarajevo?

869
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:33,215
Uh, it's true that, uh, the maestro here
has been haunting me and, uh...

870
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,758
...he has, like a spirit,

871
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:40,430
uh, been in this building,
uh, long before he arrived here in person.

872
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:45,181
And, uh, we made a piece
called "Miss Sarajevo."

873
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:49,935
We hope to perf...
We will perform this song in Modena on...

874
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:52,225
- What is the date?
- The 12th of September.

875
01:23:55,739 --> 01:24:00,609
Luciano is
one of the great emotional arm wrestlers.

876
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,490
And he will break your fucking arm.

877
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:07,199
And so we ended up in Modena, of course.

878

887
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:06,724
I remembered myself
when we were bombed here in the last war.

888
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:15,684
The gun machine.

889
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:18,394
The war, the sound of all the night long.

890
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:22,899
To see hanged people.

891
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:24,512
- You saw that?
- Oh, yes.

892
01:25:24,536 --> 01:25:27,654
I don't want to say every day, but almost.

893
01:25:28,498 --> 01:25:31,161
It was quite something for a kid.

895
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:42,799

<i>♪ E non so più pregare... ♪</i>

900
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:14,960
He was crushed by injustice,
and the war deeply offended him.

901
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:21,925
He just had this sense in him
that he better use this other currency

902
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,124
and try to do something with it.

903
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:31,768
He wanted to go to Bosnia
to help the children,

904
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:35,559
to give them a hope for the future,

905
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:38,062
because Luciano was one of those children.

906
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,858
<i>♪ Is there a time... ♪</i>

907
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:42,062
We tried to make something,

908
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:46,069
a kind of music conservatory
where the kid go there to sing.

909
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:47,616
It was the most important thing.

910
01:26:48,078 --> 01:26:51,412
This is for Bosnia.
It's for the kid of Bosnia.

911
01:26:58,588 --> 01:26:59,588
<i>Grazie.</i>

912
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:14,803
Bono! Bono! Bono! Bono!
Bono! Bono! Bono!

913
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:23,353
We went to Barbados
every year, you know, for one month.

914
01:27:23,447 --> 01:27:24,779
That was our rest.

915
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:29,408
That moment was really a bad moment

916
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,532
because, at that point,
the relationship became public.

917
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:42,421
In every Italian opera,
there's the <i>scena madre.</i>

918
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:46,501
That's the dramatic scene where the hero
comes face-to-face with potential tragedy.

919
01:27:47,095 --> 01:27:50,429
These days in Modena, almost everyone
has something to say

920
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,929
about Pavarotti's <i>scena madre</i>
and how it will play itself out.

921
01:27:54,019 --> 01:27:56,352
It's disgusting.

922
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:59,681
At the age of 60,
he shouldn't do such things.

923
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,357
Well, he was the most famous Catholic

924
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:05,152
in the most Catholic of all countries.

925
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,400
Divorce at that time was unthinkable.

926
01:28:08,033 --> 01:28:11,492
So they would devote
quite a lot of the paper to it.

927
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:15,455
In Italy, this story played out for years.

928
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,685
These days,

929
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,075
there are no real marriages.

930
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:21,081
Men have four or five wives.

931
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:22,412
There is no respect.

932
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,839
So, at the beginning, I spent,
unfortunately, my life trying to show

933
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,170
that it wasn't like that.

934
01:28:30,263 --> 01:28:34,132
I should've said, "You are wasting time."
They will still think like that.

935
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,825
And while Mrs. Pavarotti is in seclusion,

936
01:28:56,915 --> 01:29:01,455
her lawyer says all the family hopes
is that Luciano tires of it all.

937
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,819
It was bad because,
uh, I was suffering myself.

938
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:15,570
But my wife suffered more.

939
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:22,118
But they understand that I fell in love.

940
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:28,295
He caught it in the neck
for Pavarotti the pop star.

941
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:32,466
And now falling in love...
...he caught it in the neck again.

942
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:35,010
But he was owning up to his humanity.

943
01:30:35,889 --> 01:30:40,600
The grandiosity of the voice
completely disguised

944
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,473
the fact that he could be
extremely humble.

945
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:45,979
And that was a shock to me.

946
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,941
And we ended up becoming great friends.

947
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:54,147
And then she got pregnant.
I thought, "Wow."

948
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,535
The incredible thing,
that they were twins.

949
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:02,785
So we were so happy, you know?
We had double the happiness.

950
01:31:05,001 --> 01:31:07,709
We had a very complicated, uh, pregnancy.

951
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:11,039
There was, um,
kind of a tumor called molar.

952
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:15,376
The doctor said, um, in America,
said that I should give up.

953
01:31:17,347 --> 01:31:19,134
No way.

954
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:22,763
So I found a doctor in Italy, said,
"You know, there are just five, um,

955
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:24,434
cases like that in the world,

956
01:31:24,521 --> 01:31:27,229
and they were all... ended badly."

957
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:30,524
So I said,
"I want to try anyway," you know?

958
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:33,318
Eventually, they had twins,

959
01:31:33,989 --> 01:31:36,231
obviously, and unfortunately,
what happened...

960
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,986
Riccardo was lost. He was stillborn.

961
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,705
We lost my son.

962
01:31:45,583 --> 01:31:47,040
Very sad day.

963
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:51,579
But we have Alice, so still a blessing.

964
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:57,677
All the love that we should have
for both of them is on her.

965
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:02,264
Obviously, it was incredibly difficult
at first. And she was tiny.

966
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:13,984
Right from the start of her life,
you know, she was hanging on.

967
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:15,070
She was strong.

968
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:51,226
I remember his wedding.

969
01:32:51,316 --> 01:32:55,185
These people from the Emilia region,
they know how to enjoy life.

970
01:32:55,862 --> 01:32:59,355
The Vatican forbade him
from marrying Nicoletta in a church,

971
01:32:59,449 --> 01:33:02,066
so, of course, they got married
in the opera house.

972
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:04,743
And Alice became his angel.

973
01:33:14,297 --> 01:33:15,959
- Ah!
- Ah.

974
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:20,923
I was filming every little detail.

975
01:33:21,012 --> 01:33:22,878
Because she was such a joy for us,

976
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:25,885
you know, and that we wait
for Alice for such a long time.

977
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:41,356
Some month before we had Alice,

978
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:44,487
Luciano became grandfather
for the first time.

979
01:33:45,912 --> 01:33:49,030
For him, it was very important
to have the family together.

980
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:09,179
Everything that happened
could not be an ending, you know?

981
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:11,893
We had to start living again.

982
01:34:39,299 --> 01:34:42,133
I learned to love people.

983
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,961
But you cannot, you know, say "learned,"
because you are born

984
01:34:45,054 --> 01:34:46,866
- with this kind of thing inside you.
- Right.

985
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:50,429
But I keep going on
trusting blindly everybody,

986
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,288
- and, uh, most...
- So, even today?

987
01:34:52,312 --> 01:34:54,165
- Even today. Why?
- You're a trusting person?

988
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,109
- Are you joking? I will...
- Well...

989
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,671
I will...
I will not exist if I don't trust people.

990
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:12,572
I remember getting
a call from Nicoletta,

991
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:15,078
and I went over to see Pavarotti,
and he said,

992
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:18,286
"I want to do 40 concerts or thereabouts
around the world.

993
01:35:18,630 --> 01:35:22,465
Not in a rush.
And I want to open a school.

994
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:25,713
And go back to the opera house."

995
01:35:27,430 --> 01:35:30,013
He said, "You've been with me
for a long time,

996
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,715
and you never let me down.

997
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,675
And you're not gonna
let me down now, are you?"

998
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:36,558
And I said, "No. It's gonna be fantastic."

999
01:35:41,402 --> 01:35:45,897
Pavarotti, at his best,
he was just a gorgeous, glorious singer.

1000
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:49,825
He rode on that for a long time,
past his heyday and past his best,

1001
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:52,073
into roles that weren't so great for him.

1002
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:56,074
You know, the voice, it was interesting,
but, you know, it just...

1003
01:35:56,167 --> 01:35:58,250
his voice doesn't ping like it used to.

1004
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,953
He made each of his high C's.
He was straining a bit.

1005
01:36:01,464 --> 01:36:02,750
He was trying very hard,

1006
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:06,208
but it didn't come out the way he and I
would have liked it to come out.

1007
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:10,963
I remember somebody saying to me,
"Oh, no, I saw him in the great days.

1008
01:36:11,057 --> 01:36:12,548
It was a whole different thing."

1009
01:36:13,059 --> 01:36:16,143
I just think,
"You don't know anything, do you?

1010
01:36:16,229 --> 01:36:17,789
You don't know anything about singing."

1011
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:24,735
The reason why he is great
is because he has lived those songs,

1012
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:29,191
and you can hear them
in every crack of his voice.

1013
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:34,491
You have to break your heart again
and again and again to sing those songs.

1014
01:36:35,206 --> 01:36:38,620
It really pisses me off
when people miss that.

1015
01:36:40,003 --> 01:36:43,872
Because these are well-known songs.
What can you bring to them?

1016
01:36:44,841 --> 01:36:48,209
The only thing you can bring to them
is your entire life.

1017
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:52,676
A life that's been lived,
the mistakes you've made,

1018
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:53,972
the hopes, the desires...

1019
01:36:54,058 --> 01:36:59,929
that's... all that stuff
comes crashing into the performance.

1020
01:37:29,302 --> 01:37:32,261
I was conducting <i>Tosca,</i>

1021
01:37:32,347 --> 01:37:36,887
and I will never forget
Luciano singing as the noble character.

1022
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:45,895
At the end of the opera,

1023
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,478
Cavaradossi,
he knows then he's going to die.

1024
01:38:57,849 --> 01:39:03,186
Bravo!

1025
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:24,827
Bravo!

1026
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:44,639
Opera star Luciano Pavarotti
is in the hospital.

1027
01:39:45,354 --> 01:39:48,768
Last year, doctors discovered
he had pancreatic cancer.

1028
01:39:48,858 --> 01:39:51,475
He underwent surgery for it in New York.

1029
01:39:51,569 --> 01:39:54,061
His spokesman says
Pavarotti was taken to the hospital

1030
01:39:54,155 --> 01:39:56,488
in his hometown in Italy two days ago

1031
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:58,861
but isn't saying anything
about his condition.

1032
01:39:58,951 --> 01:40:00,533
Pavarotti is 71.

1033
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:08,826
We didn't know,
but he was already sick.

1034
01:40:09,879 --> 01:40:13,668
And I kept crying,
and he was trying really to...

1035
01:40:13,758 --> 01:40:16,045
to tell me that everything will be okay.

1036
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:22,382
Because his frame of mind was like that...
believing... believing in life.

1037
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:09,186
Giuliana called me
and said her father was in the hospital.

1038
01:41:09,272 --> 01:41:11,685
And then I got on a plane,
and I went to see him.

1039
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:17,608
The thing that really saddened me
about Luciano was he felt cheated.

1040
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,738
He was madder than hell.

1041
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:23,324
He'd just married Nicoletta,

1042
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:26,495
and he was leaving her
and their daughter alone.

1043
01:41:30,042 --> 01:41:32,500
Our daughter was very young.
Was four and half.

1044
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:36,797
And I always ask him,
"Why don't you write something to Alice?"

1045
01:41:37,675 --> 01:41:41,965
And he said, "No,
because if I write something,

1046
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,614
then she will stay with this for her...

1047
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:46,803
all her life, and she will not
be able to speak to me.

1048
01:41:47,143 --> 01:41:50,352
It's not right. She has to be free.
Completely free, you know?

1049
01:41:50,438 --> 01:41:52,976
I don't want to impose anything, you know?
She must be free."
