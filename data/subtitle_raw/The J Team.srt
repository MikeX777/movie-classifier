1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:08,042
Wha!

2
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:30,150
Hey! What up, roomies?

3
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,592
- Ooh, new high tops?

4
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:39,927
You know it.

5
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,029
Love, it looks like you
got here by unicorn.

6
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:44,131
- I did!

7
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,165
Jojo, you can't be late.

8
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,501
You're the team
captain, and FYI,

9
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:49,970
Nina just volunteered
to lead warm-up for you.

10
00:02:50,037 --> 00:02:51,272
So nice of her!

11
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,941
See, I told you! Nina loves me!

12
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:57,778
Hey, it's Jojo!

13
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,980
Hey, so kind of you to join us.

14
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,982
- Hey, kid.
- Sorry I'm late.

15
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,784
Were you dancing with
the mailman again?

16
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:06,787
- What? Me, and mailman?
- No, I don't...

17
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,022
Maybe.

18
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,925
- Are you all warmed up?
- I'm always warmed up.

19
00:03:11,992 --> 00:03:16,530
- All right, they're all yours.
- Five, six, seven, eight!

20
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:48,829
All right, that's was great.

21
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,398
Are you all warmed up?

22
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,967
- Yeah!
- Okay, there's something

23
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,003
I would like to talk
with you girls about.

24
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,014
Ooh! Are we picking out
new competition costumes?

25
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,673
Because I feel like this year,

26
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,184
we've gotta go head-to-toe
flippy sequins.

27
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,986
You know, the ones where
you flip them one way

28
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,354
and they're a happy face
and then you flip them back

29
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:05,379
and they're something else?

30
00:04:05,446 --> 00:04:06,847
No, this isn't about costumes.

31
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:08,425
Then, are we learning our
new competition routine?

32
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,117
- Oh!
- No, this is not about

33
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,353
- a new routine.
- Hold on a second!

34
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,888
Are we finally getting
that new vending machine.

35
00:04:14,955 --> 00:04:17,224
Please tell me there's
Sour Patch Kids.

36
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,060
This isn't about
a vending machine.

37
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,063
This is about my future
here at the studio.

38
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,135
After 30 years of teaching
dance, it's time for me

39
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:30,804
to turn the studio
over to new management.

40
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:33,374
Val, no, you can't leave.

41
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:36,076
You're not just our
coach, you're our mentor.

42
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,845
- A second mother.
- You taught us

43
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:40,314
about expressing ourself
through movement.

44
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:43,250
- And living in the moment.
- And freestyle Fridays.

45
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:45,819
Look, girls, I don't
want to view this

46
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,288
as something to be sad about.

47
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:52,092
I want you to look at this
as an exciting change.

48
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,666
I put a lot of thought into
who should take over the studio

49
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,634
and I found someone.

50
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,171
Someone who is just as
passionate about dance

51
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,807
and developing young,
creative spirits.

52
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:08,976
I know you'll be in good hands.

53
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,545
Girls, I'd like you to meet

54
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:15,383
your new dance
instructor, Poppy.

55
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,728
- Do you hear that?
- Yeah.

56
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,498
It's like she has
her own theme song.

57
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:37,638
- Not now, Mom.
- I'm changing lives.

58
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:41,509
It's Coach Poppy, and
thanks for the intro,

59
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,944
- but I got it from here.
- But I thought we discussed

60
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,513
- that I was gonna...
- Yeah, yeah,

61
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,090
I'm totally going to foster
their young, creative spirits

62
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:48,592
and move their delicate
minds and all that jazz.

63
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:50,360
- But the gradual transition...
- Transition you out,

64
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,795
though, first, Where
I was going to stay

65
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:52,720
for a while and make
sure the girls are okay.

66
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:54,054
Build, build as a team.

67
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,365
I just have one more
thing I want to say...

68
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,490
- Thanks so much!
- We don't validate anymore.

69
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,292
Sorry. Bye, bye. Whew! There.

70
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,594
That's better.

71
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,730
Now where was I? Yes?

72
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,265
- Bonding and team building.
- Right.

73
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,436
Speaking of which, would you
like to be my special helper.

74
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,071
- Okay.
- Okay.

75
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,541
Here. Take this and
build me a latte.

76
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,577
Four shots, five Splendas,
no foam, it's annoying.

77
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:18,111
This is a dollar.

78
00:06:18,178 --> 00:06:20,213
Then feel free to get
yourself an ice water.

79
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,716
Okay, go on. Go. Go, go.

80
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:29,089
Aw, cheer up ladies.
This is going to be fun.

81
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:33,326
So, so fun, as long
as follow my rules.

82
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,698
Number one, if you're
not five minutes early,

83
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:40,367
then you are late and if you
are late, you are locked out.

84
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,838
Can you hear my heart beating?

85
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:46,282
- It's cool, we got it.
- We got it.

86
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:50,277
- Here's the deal.
- I am here to build the A Team,

87
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:53,413
but right now, you guys
are just the Okay Team.

88
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:56,416
So starting today, every
class will now include

89
00:06:56,484 --> 00:06:59,052
boot camp-style
conditioning.

90
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,988
Aw, we're all disappointed.

91
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,223
Aw, I'm sorry. I
don't make the rules.

92
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,192
Oh, wait, hold on.

93
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,394
Yes I do!

94
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,829
Back up and form three lines.

95
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:12,666
Let's go! Burpees till it burns.

96
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,635
Lunge for days.

97
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:16,203
Push-ups till you throw up.

98
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,372
- Breathe. I am strong.
- I can do hard things.

99
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,675
And finally, every
dancer must wear

100
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,511
the same uniform in gray.

101
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:25,546
Not gray.

102
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,081
Did I just say that out loud?

103
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:32,185
- And you are?
- I'm Jojo.

104
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,622
I've been taking dance here
since I was, like, mm, five.

105
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:37,958
Aw, cute! And does Jojo,
who's been taking dance here

106
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:41,161
since she was, like, five,
have a problem with gray?

107
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,463
No! I mean...

108
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,733
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

109
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:48,936
- It's just so gray.
- Oh, yeah.

110
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,604
Could we possibly
like juj it up.

111
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,005
- Juj.
- Yeah!

112
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,609
We could add some color,
maybe even some sparkles.

113
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:57,678
- Sparkle?
- Yeah!

114
00:07:57,745 --> 00:07:59,322
- You know what?
- That is a great idea.

115
00:07:59,346 --> 00:08:02,516
You know, let me think
about that for a second.

116
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:05,352
Nope! Moving on!

117
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:09,022
Oh, before I forget.

118
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,058
No high tops, no ponytails,

119
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:13,026
and absolutely positively

120
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:15,963
no bows.

121
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:26,367
- Did you just say no...
- Bows.

122
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,076
Knees up! Let's go!

123
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:31,945
That is not... what is
this? Get those knees up!

124
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,814
Knees, knees,
knees! I said knees!

125
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:45,392
- Hey!
- Hey, guys!

126
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:55,535
- You okay, Jojo?
- Me? Oh, sure. I'm great.

127
00:08:55,603 --> 00:08:56,870
Yeah.

128
00:08:56,937 --> 00:08:58,872
This is a tough
transition for all of us,

129
00:08:58,939 --> 00:09:01,842
but we know it's been
extra hard on you.

130
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,977
What? No, I'm good. I'm good!

131
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,379
Plain gray, it's
actually my favorite.

132
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,915
Uh, you know,

133
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:13,486
it's like we're twirling,
leaping, cinder blocks!

134
00:09:14,788 --> 00:09:16,023
Enough about me!

135
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,464
Someone's about
to have a birthday

136
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,793
and we have some major
planning we've got to do.

137
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,971
Oh, you guys don't have
to go to a ton of trouble.

138
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,230
Are you kidding me?

139
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,532
It's your sweet sixteen,
of course we do!

140
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,000
We've got to do it up big!

141
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,670
Yeah, like a Velcro wall
or a mechanical bull.

142
00:09:29,737 --> 00:09:31,171
Ooh! Yeah!

143
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,473
Well, I did see this
one guy on Instagram

144
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,710
who can make a life-size
cotton candy sculpture of you.

145
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,445
- Done!
- Absolutely.

146
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,681
Jojo, please don't break
the dress code again.

147
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,516
My quads are still burning
from all the extra squats

148
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,885
we had to do last practice,

149
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:47,020
when you forgot to
take out your bow.

150
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,189
Oh, I'm so sorry
about that, Nina.

151
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,258
It won't happen
again, I promise.

152
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,528
Hey, guys, ready to go in?

153
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,230
Jojo, your bow.

154
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:03,603
Val gave me this bow.

155
00:10:05,472 --> 00:10:07,150
Told me she hoped that
I would always dance

156
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:08,876
to the beat of my own drum.

157
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:15,749
I don't know if I
can do it, guys.

158
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:20,788
Looking the same as everyone
just doesn't feel right.

159
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:23,824
I know this is hard, Jojo,
but you know the rules.

160
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:27,060
If she catches you with a bow
again, you're off the team.

161
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,940
Hear me out.

162
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:43,010
What if...

163
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,645
What if she doesn't see it?

164
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:53,386
The doors will be closing
in five, four, three...

165
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:54,898
- We're here, we're here!
- Ready to boogie!

166
00:10:54,922 --> 00:10:59,292
Two!

167
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:02,362
Delightful. Gather around.

168
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:05,766
Now, as you may know, our
first opportunity to compete

169
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:09,636
will be at the upcoming Main
Street Dance Competition.

170
00:11:09,703 --> 00:11:12,539
Small potatoes, but we
are going for two reasons:

171
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,343
One, to scope out
the competition.

172
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:20,147
And two, to practice
crushing them.

173
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:23,216
That way, we'll be ready
for the real competition.

174
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:24,551
The real competition?

175
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,987
The First Position Competition,

176
00:11:27,054 --> 00:11:29,456
the only competition
that matters.

177
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:37,831
Ooh, I look good.

178
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,533
Look at me.

179
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,835
Anyway, I digress.

180
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,037
First things first,
to the mirror! Voila!

181
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,174
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go!

182
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,911
Now, when you look in the
mirror, what do you see?

183
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:55,548
Cement? Storm clouds.

184
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,117
Statue of me.

185
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,786
- Gigi.
- Jojo.

186
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,354
Okay. When I ask a question,

187
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,956
I don't actually want an answer.

188
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,457
You don't?

189
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:07,160
No, I want you to wait an
appropriate amount of time,

190
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,229
till you feel just the
right amount of awkward,

191
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:11,531
and then I will
answer it for you.

192
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,532
Do you understand?

193
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,167
- But I was just...
- No!

194
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,136
Again, that is a question

195
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:18,505
I don't actually
want an answer for.

196
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,041
- Okay, but I was just being...
- Moving on!

197
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,576
Ciao!

198
00:12:23,643 --> 00:12:27,547
All right, who here can tell
me why we practice so hard?

199
00:12:27,614 --> 00:12:31,084
Oh, that's actually a question
I do want an answer to.

200
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,786
To express what's inside of us?

201
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:33,854
Nope.

202
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,655
So we can bond as a team?

203
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:37,090
Not even close.

204
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,634
To squash the dreams
of our competitors.

205
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:40,727
Ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding!

206
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,830
Yes! I smell a winner!

207
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:43,931
Go ahead, Tina!

208
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:46,766
- It's Nina.
- Back up! Listen!

209
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,402
Now, it's time for me to
make you all into winners.

210
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,572
All right? Back up! Spread out!

211
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,007
Two lines! Let's go!

212
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,679
No!

213
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:28,175
Come on! Come on, ladies!

214
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,721
- That is not low.
- You call that low?

215
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:35,015
Low, low, low,
low!

216
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,764
Stop! Everybody freeze.

217
00:14:24,831 --> 00:14:29,236
Freeze, freeze, freeze. What
is going on around here?

218
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,739
And by here, I mean here.

219
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,141
What?

220
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,677
Jojo, your personality is
poking me in my eyeball.

221
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,980
You're sticking out
and pulling focus.

222
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,415
You know what you are?
You're a pop-a-color.

223
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:44,584
- Yeah!
- No, that is not a compliment.

224
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:48,155
Stop popping! There's
no popping. Pop it off!

225
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:52,092
Miss Thing, you
have to blend in.

226
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,296
You... you want me to... ha.

227
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,865
- Yeah, get it out.
- You can do it.

228
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:02,002
- Both: Blend.
- In.

229
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,071
- Um, Coach Poppy?
- You are?

230
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:09,309
- Afraid. Oh, I mean, hi.
- I'm Ruby D and she's Ruby M,

231
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,244
but most people just
call us the Rubies.

232
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:12,980
Apparently, it was
a very popular name

233
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:14,181
the year we were born.

234
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,949
There's also two
Olivias, four Sophias,

235
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,117
and a growing number of Avas...

236
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,461
I'm sorry, are
you still talking?

237
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,752
I stopped listening.

238
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,389
The glare from your
glasses is distracting.

239
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,655
- Okay.
- Okay.

240
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,258
I think what Ruby
is trying to say

241
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:29,529
is that Jojo is a great dancer,
maybe the strongest we have.

242
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,498
If you find yourself
drawn to watching Jojo,

243
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:34,267
- doesn't that just mean...
- No! No, no, no, no, no!

244
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:37,270
I don't want to see
individual faces.

245
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:39,906
I don't want to
see none of this,

246
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,009
or this...

247
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:44,111
Or this.

248
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:46,113
None of it.

249
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:48,615
I just want one glorious,

250
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:51,318
homogenized blob of
perfect technique

251
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,586
and if the Rubies can't
get with the program,

252
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,589
then, well, maybe the Rubies
can start a Jojo fan club

253
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,992
with all the free time
you have on your hands

254
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,760
when you're off my team.

255
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,065
- I'll do it.
- What?

256
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,433
- What?
- I'll do it.

257
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,800
I'll try harder to blend in.

258
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,070
- Terrific. Moving on.
- I love this place.

259
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,571
And she's still talking.

260
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:15,775
It's my second home,
and you guys, you guys

261
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,744
are all like my sisters.

262
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,614
Most weeks, I spend more time
here than I do at my own house

263
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,584
and when I'm here, I feel
like I'm at my favorite place

264
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,887
and I'm with my favorite people.

265
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:31,291
So I'll do it. I
can blend, watch!

266
00:16:33,126 --> 00:16:35,328
See, look at me.

267
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:39,332
I'm a dancing robot.
I feel nothing.

268
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43,803
Totally dead inside.

269
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:52,845
That good, eh?

270
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,914
- What is that?
- What? What is what?

271
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:57,484
That glittering
monstrosity on your head.

272
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,222
- Oh, this!
- This is a new product

273
00:17:02,289 --> 00:17:03,723
to fluff my bun, actually.

274
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,326
- It's called a bun fluffer.
- That's not a bun fluffer.

275
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,027
That's a bow.

276
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,730
A big, happy, glittering bow,

277
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,699
and I do not like glitter, Jojo.

278
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,302
Who doesn't like glitter?

279
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,404
Look, Poppy, if
you want to be part

280
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,005
of Mr. Melody's Glitter Girls,

281
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,283
then I'm going to
need you to sparkle.

282
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:21,541
Give me sparkle!

283
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:27,947
Sparkle! Sparkle!

284
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,783
Ugh, stop.

285
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,987
Halt! Poppy, cease and desist!

286
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,856
I need some expression!

287
00:17:36,923 --> 00:17:42,923
Give me this and this, and this!

288
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,265
Show her how it's done, girls.

289
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,669
- See, see, see!
- Look at your little sister!

290
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:52,405
If Rosie can sparkle,
why can't you?

291
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:56,909
Yes, Rosie, yes!
Give me Madonna!

292
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,878
Paula Abdul!

293
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:03,350
And Miss Jackson, 'cause
you're in control!

294
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,084
And I'm never going to stop.

295
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,988
Uh, uh, uh, excuse me, madam,

296
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:11,858
but there is no crying in
Mr. Melody's Glitter Girls.

297
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,427
But I saw you crying
in the parking lot.

298
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,397
Out!

299
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:19,666
You are hereby banished
from the Glitter Girls.

300
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:28,275
And FYI, Poppy, you will never
success if you can't sparkle.

301
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,944
What do you think is
happening right now?

302
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:35,148
Maybe she's having a flashback.

303
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,251
I am, I'm almost done.

304
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:41,421
Okay, I'm done. Where was I?

305
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,789
Ooh, I know!

306
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:46,025
And I do not like glitter, Jojo!

307
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:49,529
Right. And I do not
like glitter, Jojo!

308
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:52,031
And you are like human glitter,

309
00:18:52,098 --> 00:18:54,801
and I just don't think you're
the right fit for this team.

310
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,337
- What? No, no, no!
- I will do anything.

311
00:18:57,404 --> 00:18:58,971
- Anything?
- Anything!

312
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:01,708
Okay, well, if you want
to stay on this team,

313
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:05,978
then I suggest that you
find your sparkle switch

314
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,480
and turn it off.

315
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,118
Okay.

316
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:50,089
- Moving on.
- Form two lines, eyes on me.

317
00:19:57,397 --> 00:19:59,399
Okay. We've got my bags.

318
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:01,434
Desi! Hey!

319
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:04,103
Jojo! Hi!

320
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,472
Aw, how are you?

321
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:08,675
- I'm good.
- Girl, should I call 9-1-1?

322
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,777
Because someone's
stolen your sparkle.

323
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:13,280
I didn't even recognize
you without your bow.

324
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:17,750
- Yeah. Me neither.
- New coach, new rules.

325
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:20,587
You, though...
you look fabulous!

326
00:20:20,653 --> 00:20:22,355
I know, right?

327
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,733
The only good part about moving
away from my mom's new job

328
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:26,693
is that I could start
fresh at a new school,

329
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,263
new dance studio and
just be who I really am,

330
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,199
and this, is who I really am.

331
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,668
Aw, I love it!

332
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,971
You seem so happy, and
that makes me really happy.

333
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,673
So your new studio,
are they good.

334
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,709
- Oh, it'll do.
- But I miss you guys.

335
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,277
It's just not the same.

336
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:47,580
Trust me, literally
nothing is the same.

337
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:09,001
- These are some warm-up suits.
- What does P-PAC stand for?

338
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,703
Poppy's Performing Arts Center.

339
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,574
Jojo, be like Beyonce
and get in formation.

340
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,209
- Oh, these are so heavy.

341
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,678
- See you, Desi.
- Bye.

342
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,947
And there's so many.

343
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:25,151
Excuse me, guys.
Don't mind me! Sorry.

344
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,254
And now, formerly known
as Dance Mentions.

345
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,023
From Poppy's
Performing Art Center,

346
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:07,226
please welcome the P-PAC!

347
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,844
Wow, so precise and in sync!

348
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,081
So graceful, and yet,
I'm intimidating by them.

349
00:23:02,148 --> 00:23:03,550
Almost scared.

350
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,452
That's exactly what
I was going for.

351
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:15,695
What in human combination?

352
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,330
Jojo, knock it off!

353
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,172
Jojo, knock it off!

354
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,418
Then that lift at the beginning,

355
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:41,554
that was like the best
time we ever did it! I...

356
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:43,656
Hey, Desi! Congrats!

357
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,291
Oh my gosh, your
team was amazing.

358
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,994
- Stop, you're too kind.
- Tell me more.

359
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,362
- And you guys are fantastic.

360
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:51,531
I loved your solo.

361
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,066
Yeah. Nice solo, Jojo.

362
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:55,978
Apparently a fourth place
trophy is too embarrassing

363
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:57,369
to even bring home.

364
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,981
- Don't even sweat it.
- This competition is just

365
00:23:59,005 --> 00:24:00,940
a warm-up to the first
position competition.

366
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,074
I'll see you there, right?

367
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,844
- Of course you will...
- Jojo!

368
00:24:04,911 --> 00:24:06,445
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

369
00:24:06,513 --> 00:24:09,081
- Congratulations?
- How about you're welcome,

370
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,917
'cause you basically
gave 'em first place!

371
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,418
I mean, look at her.

372
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,196
What am I supposed to do...
Take this little thing.

373
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,222
Everybody else was
giving fierce blue steel

374
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,058
while you were out there
looking like human jazz hands

375
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,392
with a glitter manicure

376
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,564
and you know I do not
like glitter, Jojo!

377
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:27,133
I'm sorry, guys.

378
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:30,169
Listen, I tried to turn off my
sparkle switch, I really did.

379
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:31,904
Then it was like
the beat kicked in

380
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,606
and I just felt it in my bones.

381
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,118
It was like, my brain knew that
I wasn't supposed to sparkle,

382
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:37,910
but nothing told
my feet or my face.

383
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,211
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,789
You know what, this
isn't working out.

385
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,214
We're breaking up with you.

386
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:46,085
- What? We are?
- No, we're not. We're not.

387
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:51,057
- Then I am!
- It's not you, Jojo, it's me.

388
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,725
- What?
- No, who we are kidding.

389
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,494
It's totally you.
P-PAC your bags.

390
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:59,031
Oh, and FYI, you will never
success if you don't learn

391
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,433
how to turn off your sparkle.

392
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,969
- I...
- No, no.

393
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:05,838
- Please just...
- Zip it!

394
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08,808
Moving on!

395
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,410
Guys.

396
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,653
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

397
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,688
You know, I've
gone to that studio

398
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:58,124
almost every day
that I can remember

399
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,328
and without it, I
don't know where to go.

400
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,997
Oh, sweetheart.

401
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,133
You know she tricked me.

402
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:09,902
Told me she wanted to
cultivate a competitive spirit

403
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:12,404
in our youth and
foster creativity.

404
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,673
- Yeah.
- Uh-uh.

405
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,107
Then she changed the locks

406
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:17,710
and didn't even invite
me to the competition.

407
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:20,046
That's why you weren't there!

408
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:23,149
Oh, and she also changed
the name of the studio.

409
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,851
- She didn't.
- She did.

410
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,386
To Poppy's Performing
Art Center.

411
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,521
P-PAC for short.

412
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,290
- P-PAC?
- P-PAC.

413
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:34,560
Oh, I'd like to P-PAC
her right in the face.

414
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:37,463
- Oh, wow.

415
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:41,634
I am so sorry, Jojo. I
feel like this is my fault.

416
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:44,203
It's not your fault, and I
don't want you to be sorry.

417
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,305
Coach Poppy is who
should be sorry.

418
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:49,976
Hey! We had a feeling this
is where you would be.

419
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:53,813
Are you okay, Jojo?

420
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,049
Okay, girls, come with me.

421
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,651
I want to show you something.

422
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,763
Even though it seems
everybody else is doing things

423
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:03,990
one way doesn't mean it's
the right way for you.

424
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:07,326
You don't need that studio
to do what you love.

425
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:10,362
If you really want to perform,

426
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:12,832
you'll find a way
to do it anywhere.

427
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:17,169
Wow! Look at this place!

428
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,171
What is all this stuff?

429
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,608
Odds and ends, just things
I've collected from decades

430
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:26,078
of putting on dance
recitals and shows.

431
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:29,281
- Are there mirrors in here?
- Oh, lots of 'em.

432
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,350
Do you guys see what I see?

433
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:35,254
Three, possibly four,
different kinds of spiders.

434
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:39,125
No. Potential.

435
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,571
Guys! I have an idea!

436
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:08,607
- Ooh, breakfast for dinner.
- Close!

437
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,209
Why don't we start our own team?

438
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,111
Uh, like a dodgeball team?

439
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,246
No, no, no, like a dance team.

440
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:15,681
Jojo and the Rubies.

441
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:17,449
We're already sound
like a rock band,

442
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,818
and there's still so much
time. We can make up a routine

443
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:22,521
and register for the First
Position Competition.

444
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:25,691
- I don't know, Jojo.
- It's a fun idea.

445
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:28,794
So fun, but the thing is,

446
00:30:28,861 --> 00:30:31,163
Poppy says we're going to
win Nationals this year

447
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,966
and I've never won anything.

448
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,801
Not even "Solitaire."

449
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,270
Yeah. Part of me totally
wants to quit the team

450
00:30:38,337 --> 00:30:40,873
and joins yours, but
the other part of me

451
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,885
knows my folks will kill me
because they already paid

452
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,377
for my competition costumes,

453
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,946
and since I'm both
a people pleaser

454
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:49,248
and a chronic rule
follower, I'm not quite sure

455
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:51,517
which particular part
to pick presently.

456
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,458
- It's all right, guys.
- It was just an idea.

457
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:54,786
- JoJo.
- No, really.

458
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,956
If you guys want to stay
in the P-PAC, I get it.

459
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,224
It's totally okay.

460
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,892
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

461
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,037
We're still going to hang
out on my birthday, right?

462
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,730
Are you kidding? We better be.

463
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,540
- Again.
- Five, six, seven, eight.

464
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,675
And one, two, three, four.

465
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:19,845
Lines, lines, seven,
eight, two, two.

466
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:21,113
What are you doing?

467
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:23,015
Five, six, you're looking janky.

468
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:26,118
Stop. Oh, y'all look a hot mess.

469
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:28,187
Y'all got my choreo
looking basic.

470
00:31:28,254 --> 00:31:31,190
Take five and go get
better. Just... would you?

471
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,359
Hey, remember this?

472
00:31:36,462 --> 00:31:39,331
Hey. What is that?

473
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:41,133
- What? What was what?
- Who? What? Where?

474
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,269
Knock-knock. Who's there?

475
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,836
What's that move? Do it again.

476
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,173
What move? This move?

477
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,509
- Oh, I like it.
- We're putting it in.

478
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:53,179
Let's go!

479
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:57,349
You're all right, Bobo?

480
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:00,052
I know, we haven't been
to a park in a while,

481
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,956
but suddenly I have a lot
of free times on my hands,

482
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,767
so you better get ready
because it looks like

483
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:09,161
we're gonna be doing
this a lot more often.

484
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:16,202
Hold on. You stay here.
I'll be right back.

485
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:35,274
Looks like I'm gonna
need more hot chocolate.

486
00:34:35,341 --> 00:34:37,176
You wanna win?

487
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:43,243
Well, winning costs, and right
here is where you start paying.

488
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:51,523
Uh, yeah, so I knew
you would agree, girl.

489
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,668
Yeah, so I'm going to just
talk to you later, okay?

490
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:56,762
Bye-bye. Beep.

491
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:58,930
That was a really great
practice today, coach,

492
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:01,099
- really great.
- Spit it out, Phoebe.

493
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,435
- Ruby.
- Right.

494
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:05,147
I was just wondering
if we can end practice

495
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:08,240
on time next Saturday, I'm
having a few friends over.

496
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:09,908
How nice. What's the occasion?

497
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:12,043
Oh, it's nothing, my birthday.

498
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,645
Oh, fun!

499
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,814
So we can end practice on time?

500
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:20,319
- Of course not.
- We will stop when we're done.

501
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:22,421
- Oh.
- Also, what should I bring?

502
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,557
- Excuse me?
- To the party.

503
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:28,294
Oh, it's not a party,
more of a get-together.

504
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,695
Oh, even better.

505
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:32,631
It will be a bonding
experience for all of us.

506
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,800
- All of us?
- Yup, the whole team.

507
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:38,204
See you at 6:00, and no glitter.

508
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:43,975
- Hey, what's this?
- A dance team?

509
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,844
But we're not dancers.

510
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,779
Technically, I saw you dance.

511
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:52,618
You're just not a technical
dancer technically yet.

512
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:54,453
- Huh?
- I'll show you.

513
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,198
Pepper, remember when
you were playing football

514
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:58,624
and you... you faked
right, you ran to the left.

515
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,368
You did a little twist-twist,
and then you spun,

516
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:02,003
and then you spiked the
ball after the touchdown?

517
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:03,362
- Yeah.
- Let me see that.

518
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:07,933
Okay.

519
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,335
Hey!

520
00:36:09,401 --> 00:36:10,902
All right, all right.

521
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:16,275
Jess, let me hear a
little... something.

522
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:24,416
Seven, eight.

523
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:26,385
Hey!

524
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:29,020
See, now that was a dance.

525
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:32,824
Sunnie, let me see
your best soccer move.

526
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:34,091
Okay.

527
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:41,800
Hey! That was incredible.

528
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,102
- Jess.
- I've got it.

529
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,246
Hey!

530
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,447
I did that?

531
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,416
- You did that.
- Should we all try?

532
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:58,683
All: Yeah.

533
00:37:01,253 --> 00:37:07,253
Five, six, seven, eight.

534
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,429
- Whoo!
- Hey!

535
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:11,806
I wanna show you guys
this little dance

536
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,198
that I've been working on.

537
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:14,966
This is called the JoJo Jam.

538
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,167
Here you go.

539
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:20,506
You go back, forward,
pump, pump, kick,

540
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,841
kick, a twist, twist, slide.

541
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:25,243
Hey!

542
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:27,846
You see, dance is all
about expressing yourself.

543
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,748
Everyone has a little
sparkle in them.

544
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,583
You've just got to let it out.

545
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,752
Jess, let's hear a
little funky beat.

546
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,424
Hey!

547
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:43,629
- Hey, let's go.
- Hey!

548
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,537
- Hey, wait.
- Why are we doing this again?

549
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:52,871
Yeah, what gives?

550
00:37:52,938 --> 00:37:55,541
Why do you want us to be
part of your dance team?

551
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,744
Well, my coach kicked
me off the team.

552
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,522
She said that I needed
to find my sparkle switch

553
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:02,414
and turn it off.

554
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,050
And I tried. I really did.

555
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,454
But what can I say? I'm sparkly.

556
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,359
So now I'm all on my own.

557
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,694
No you're not I'm in.

558
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:17,796
My first season, I
missed a penalty kick

559
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:20,766
that could have won my
team the championship game.

560
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,810
When I cried on the field,
my coach called me "Weepy"

561
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:23,969
for the rest of the year.

562
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:25,537
In third grade, Max Cohen said

563
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:27,148
I couldn't play football
with him at lunch

564
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,774
because he said I
played like a girl.

565
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:32,411
So I practiced every day
since to prove him right.

566
00:38:32,478 --> 00:38:33,679
I'm in too.

567
00:38:33,745 --> 00:38:34,846
My step-mom told me cheerleading

568
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,314
isn't a real sport,

569
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:38,025
so she wouldn't let me
try out for the team,

570
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,851
so now I make up
cheers around the house

571
00:38:39,918 --> 00:38:41,228
encouraging her
to cook something

572
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,955
that actually tastes
good. I'm in too.

573
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:45,700
You know, it sounds
like we've all been told

574
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:47,258
that we don't fit in before.

575
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,696
On my last team, we
all had to be the same.

576
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,731
What if on this team

577
00:38:52,798 --> 00:38:55,534
we celebrated
everyone being unique?

578
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:57,736
- Yeah.

579
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:25,684
Guys! Oh, yeah!

580
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:27,352
Who are all those people?

581
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:30,155
Looks like she found
some new friends.

582
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:32,199
Are you still going to tell
her we're using her moves?

583
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:33,432
Are you still gonna tell her

584
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:35,326
that she's uninvited
to your birthday?

585
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,432
You guys, we can
totally do this.

586
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,801
Do what, exactly?

587
00:41:42,868 --> 00:41:45,103
Register for the First
Position Competition.

588
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,206
If you finish top three,
you qualify for nationals.

589
00:41:48,273 --> 00:41:49,808
This year they're
in Springfield,

590
00:41:49,875 --> 00:41:51,810
which is just a
couple hours away.

591
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,187
Do you really think
we have a shot?

592
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:56,047
Judging by what I just
saw, I know we do.

593
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,183
- Oh, my gosh!

594
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:01,553
If I tell JoJo I gave away
her moves, she could ask me

595
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,189
to tell Coach Poppy that
she can't have them.

596
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,757
I'm sure that
would go over well.

597
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,425
And if you tell JoJo
that Coach Poppy

598
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:10,929
is coming to your birthday,
she'll be nice and come anyway.

599
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,832
But Coach Poppy said no glitter,

600
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,501
and we both know
what that means.

601
00:42:16,568 --> 00:42:18,169
So what do we do?

602
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:20,038
Hey, good practice, everybody.

603
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,807
I'll see you tomorrow.

604
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,208
Good day, good day, good day.

605
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,644
That was awesome. We did it.

606
00:42:25,711 --> 00:42:28,279
- Yeah. Hey, girls.
- Hi.

607
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:29,648
My Rubies!

608
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,917
Man, it's good to see you
guys. Come on, come on.

609
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,885
You gotta come in.
Check this out.

610
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:41,359
- Wow, it looks great in here.
- Thanks.

611
00:42:41,426 --> 00:42:45,163
It's so weird not seeing
you every day. We miss you.

612
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,333
I know. I miss you guys too,
but hey, at least we're gonna

613
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,401
see each other at the
First Position Competition.

614
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:52,270
- Awesome.
- You're gonna come watch?

615
00:42:52,337 --> 00:42:56,207
Close. I'm actually
competing with my new team.

616
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,576
- Cool.
- So cool.

617
00:42:58,644 --> 00:43:00,011
Wow, so that's your new team.

618
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,828
I thought those were
just some new friends.

619
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,082
Well, I mean, they're that too.

620
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:06,885
- Bonus.
- Yay for new friends.

621
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,452
You guys, you're
going to love 'em.

622
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:11,422
Oh, actually, hold
on one second.

623
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:14,693
Sunnie, she forgot her
ball, which is so Sunnie.

624
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,561
I'll be right back.

625
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:21,532
"Which is so Sunnie."

626
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,070
Oh, my gosh. I just
made fun of her.

627
00:43:25,136 --> 00:43:28,039
Why did I do that? I
don't make fun of people.

628
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,677
I'm a nice person,
or maybe I'm not.

629
00:43:31,743 --> 00:43:33,044
Maybe I'm a terrible person

630
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:34,746
that doesn't want
JoJo to replace us.

631
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:38,049
- All right. Take a breath.
- It's perfectly normal for us

632
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,919
to feel jealous about
her making new friends.

633
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:44,155
- She looks so happy.
- I don't want to tell her

634
00:43:44,222 --> 00:43:47,458
she can't come to my birthday
and bum her out again.

635
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:49,895
I can't believe JoJo
has got a new team.

636
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:52,798
And she's competing against us.

637
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,232
Do we tell Coach Poppy?

638
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:57,468
I don't want to
bum her out either.

639
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,143
There she is.

640
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,121
Ladies and gentlemen, the
girl who kicked so high

641
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,347
in fifth grade she gave
herself a concussion.

642
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,751
The only Jo who's so extra
she needed an extra Jo.

643
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:15,821
JoJo the Baroness
of Bows is back.

644
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:17,522
Desi, you are too much,

645
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,992
which by the way happens
to be the perfect amount.

646
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,593
Someone looks like
herself again.

647
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,860
What do you mean, my bow?

648
00:44:23,895 --> 00:44:25,897
No, no, it's more
like your smile.

649
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,398
This old thing?

650
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:29,167
I'm glad to see
you're back to being

651
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:31,378
the rainbow glitter sparkle
dream queen that you are.

652
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,772
I mean, you're not wrong.

653
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,674
So where are the Rubies
and the rest of the team?

654
00:44:36,742 --> 00:44:38,309
I've got my own team now.

655
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:42,080
Remember, ladies, second
place is just first losers.

656
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:45,917
First loser.  Loser.

657
00:44:45,984 --> 00:44:47,685
Don't worry about her, guys.

658
00:44:47,753 --> 00:44:48,953
What are you doing here?

659
00:44:48,987 --> 00:44:51,823
I'm competing with my new team.

660
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:53,391
Didn't you guys tell her?

661
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,730
It must have
slipped their minds.

662
00:45:01,166 --> 00:45:03,201
Hey, Nina, long time no see.

663
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,238
You guys look great, by the way.

664
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,055
- It's good to see you, JoJo.
- You look...

665
00:45:09,107 --> 00:45:12,978
Like, I don't know what
team you belong to.

666
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,345
You guys don't even match.

667
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:16,281
That's because we're all unique.

668
00:45:16,347 --> 00:45:19,584
Cute. So, JoJo, are you sad

669
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,386
that you're not with
the A-Team anymore?

670
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,823
No 'cause now she's
on the J Team.

671
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,090
That's right.

672
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,762
- I think your mom is calling.
- No, that's not my mama.

673
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:32,430
Mama, mama.

674
00:45:32,497 --> 00:45:34,465
Oh, you don't know
my mother's ringtone.

675
00:45:34,532 --> 00:45:36,701
- Yeah, I do.
- Tell her I say, "Hi."

676
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:38,003
- Ooh!

677
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,670
Mama, what?

678
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:07,999
Whoo-hoo! Go, J Team, go!

679
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:21,746
That's our move.

680
00:46:21,813 --> 00:46:24,649
That human sequin
stole my choreography.

681
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:38,696
Hey!

682
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,969
And now give it
up for The P-PAC!

683
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:46,204
- All right, ladies.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

684
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,606
I want those lines. Hustle.

685
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:50,608
JoJo, I have to
tell you something.

686
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:52,110
Reba, will you please?

687
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:55,780
- It's Ruby.
- Join the crew. Thank you.

688
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:26,811
Did I just see
what I think I saw?

689
00:47:26,878 --> 00:47:29,547
Yeah, they just
did the JoJo Jam.

690
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,219
Are they pulling out jump ropes?

691
00:47:34,285 --> 00:47:36,054
Is that even legal?

692
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,874
Our third place winner,

693
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:59,911
who will be continuing on
to nationals, is Troop TNT.

694
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:06,017
- We're going to nationals.
- Thank you. Thank you.

695
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,218
Guys, don't stress, all right?

696
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:08,586
We danced our hearts out.

697
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:10,989
We don't need some
gimmick like jump ropes.

698
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,558
Second place, also headed
to the national level of

699
00:48:13,624 --> 00:48:16,427
the First Position
Competition, goes to.

700
00:48:16,494 --> 00:48:20,465
The J Team!

701
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,101
Thank you so much!

702
00:48:23,168 --> 00:48:27,472
And the regional winner of the
All-American First Position.

703
00:48:27,538 --> 00:48:31,242
Dance Competition
goes to The P-PAC!

704
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:36,714
- Whoo, yes! That's mine!
- Give it to me! Oh, I won.

705
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:39,517
- Congratulations.

706
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,953
Don't think I didn't notice
you trying to steal my moves.

707
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,588
Nice try, but it didn't work.

708
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:47,292
- Your moves?
- I'm so good.

709
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,527
- This is perfect.
- Right.

710
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,196
Good luck at nationals.

711
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,331
Only losers need luck, honey.

712
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,566
Moving on!

713
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:00,471
- JoJo, I can explain.
- I'm so sorry.

714
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:03,708
- Winners never apologize.
- Moving on!

715
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,576
Girl, when I say,
"Moving on," move it on.

716
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:09,347
Come on now, child, we
move on when we win.

717
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:11,849
- Guys, we did it!

718
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:26,597
JoJo, this was all my fault.

719
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:27,732
I know.

720
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,135
And I take full responsibility.

721
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,769
You should.

722
00:49:31,836 --> 00:49:35,006
And I'm pretty sure your
neighbor is calling 911 on us.

723
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:37,808
Can we come in please?

724
00:49:40,211 --> 00:49:42,947
Did you get the fruit
shaped like flowers I sent?

725
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:44,449
I did. Thank you.

726
00:49:44,515 --> 00:49:46,584
And the flowers
shaped like fruit?

727
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,718
Mm-hmm.

728
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:49,254
Are you just going to ghost us?

729
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,189
- I've been busy.
- It's nothing personal.

730
00:49:51,256 --> 00:49:54,292
I don't know if you saw any
of the TikToks I tagged you in

731
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:57,395
or the embroidered
pillow I had sent over.

732
00:49:57,462 --> 00:49:59,379
You really can find
anything on the Internet.

733
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,268
Like the pillow says,

734
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,603
"I didn't offer
your moves to Poppy.

735
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:08,073
"She saw me doing them and
then put it in the routine

736
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,707
because she loved it,"

737
00:50:09,774 --> 00:50:12,843
partly because it's
great choreography

738
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,314
and partly because I'm
such a skilled dancer.

739
00:50:19,717 --> 00:50:23,488
I mean, do you know how
it felt to see my moves

740
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:26,257
in the hands of the coach
that kicked me off the team?

741
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:28,293
We are terrible,
terrible people.

742
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,529
I know I should have told her
that she couldn't have them,

743
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:35,700
but she scares me, and
for a split second,

744
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:38,336
it felt like she
almost liked me.

745
00:50:38,403 --> 00:50:40,071
I get it.

746
00:50:40,138 --> 00:50:42,907
I threw away my first bow to
try and get her to like me.

747
00:50:44,342 --> 00:50:45,710
Guys, we can't let Coach Poppy

748
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:48,779
or anyone come between us, okay?

749
00:50:48,846 --> 00:50:51,082
- Okay.
- It's a deal.

750
00:50:51,149 --> 00:50:52,650
I miss you guys.

751
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:56,020
I'm so excited to party at
your birthday on Saturday.

752
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,989
Actually, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

753
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,958
What?

754
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:03,928
What is it? We're still
hanging out, right?

755
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:06,297
Our practice schedule
is so crazy right now,

756
00:51:06,364 --> 00:51:10,000
I just think we should
postpone until after nationals.

757
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:12,803
What? No way. No.

758
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:14,448
All of us are under
so much pressure.

759
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:16,541
It's just not the right
time for my birthday.

760
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,152
- Not the right time?
- Are you kidding?

761
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:21,112
It's your sweet 16. We've
got to do something.

762
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:22,613
It's not a big deal.

763
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,251
Seriously, we'll party
after the competition.

764
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:33,858
Okay, I'm going
to get a picture.

765
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,327
- Yes.
- That was awesome.

766
00:51:36,394 --> 00:51:38,028
The lights, the
crowd, the energy.

767
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,564
Yeah.

768
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,875
You think that was awesome,
just wait until nationals.

769
00:51:41,899 --> 00:51:44,169
Who knew second place
could feel this good?

770
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,670
Hey, we made top three.

771
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:48,105
We get to move on.
That's all that matters.

772
00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:49,574
I'll tell you what matters.

773
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,518
That Poppy person needs
to be put in her place.

774
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:53,209
- Yeah, I second that.
- She is not cool.

775
00:51:53,244 --> 00:51:56,080
Agreed. Part of me wants
to win at nationals

776
00:51:56,147 --> 00:51:58,216
just to see her face.

777
00:51:58,283 --> 00:51:59,984
I think we can do it.

778
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:01,486
Look, you all did well,

779
00:52:01,552 --> 00:52:03,564
but if you really want a
chance to win at nationals...

780
00:52:03,588 --> 00:52:05,156
And squash Poppy's dreams.

781
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:06,357
That too.

782
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:08,593
Then we'll do whatever it takes.

783
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:10,828
Okay. Well, here's the thing,

784
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:12,930
it's not enough to do your best.

785
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,966
You really need to push
yourselves further.

786
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:18,569
You can't just dance
with your body.

787
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,638
You've got to dance
with your soul.

788
00:52:20,705 --> 00:52:23,908
- Wait, did we learn that move?
- It's not a move.

789
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,010
It's a feeling.

790
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,354
Do you ever have that
feeling in your gut

791
00:52:27,378 --> 00:52:29,547
when you wanted something so bad

792
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:31,158
and everyone told you
you can't have it?

793
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:32,626
I think she means like
when you're in overtime

794
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:34,051
in the finals

795
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:35,962
and you see the other team
starting to celebrate,

796
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,931
so you decide to school them
with a penalty kick that lands

797
00:52:37,955 --> 00:52:40,758
with the sweet sound of you
ruining that pizza party

798
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,403
they thought they were
about to just have.

799
00:52:42,427 --> 00:52:45,863
Oh, why didn't
you just say that?

800
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,832
- Are you guys ready for this?
- Yeah.

801
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:50,435
'Cause we're about to
go to the next level.

802
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,237
J Team on three.

803
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,504
One, two, three.

804
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:55,139
All: J Team!

805
00:52:56,707 --> 00:52:59,109
Hey, thanks for coming
on such short notice.

806
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:01,379
I'm a big fan of your work.

807
00:53:01,446 --> 00:53:03,381
Whoa, it's like
looking in a mirror.

808
00:53:03,448 --> 00:53:05,316
This thing is oddly realistic.

809
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,328
You're very talented.
Hold up, I've gotta go get

810
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:12,056
the birthday girl to see this.

811
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,763
Sounds like someone's home.

812
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,638
Surprise! Happy sweet 16.

813
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,442
You're having a party.

814
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,911
More of a get-together.

815
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,249
Without me.

816
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:42,520
- I thought everybody was here.
- Is that the pizza guy? Oh.

817
00:53:42,587 --> 00:53:45,556
Yeah.

818
00:53:45,623 --> 00:53:48,125
It's just the pizza guy.

819
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:49,260
JoJo, wait.

820
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,128
Happy birthday.

821
00:53:57,335 --> 00:54:00,438
How you doing?

822
00:54:00,505 --> 00:54:03,207
- Okay.
- Really?

823
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:05,233
It seems like you've got
the weight of the world

824
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,546
on your shoulders.

825
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:11,649
Kind of feels like
somebody put my heart

826
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:14,452
in a blender and hit puree.

827
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:17,555
Ouch.

828
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:20,591
I think I lost my best friends.

829
00:54:20,658 --> 00:54:23,761
One of them stole my moves, and

830
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:31,302
the other, she had
a party without me.

831
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,571
I'm so sorry.

832
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:36,507
I thought I knew them so well.

833
00:54:36,574 --> 00:54:37,775
I know that Ruby D.

834
00:54:37,842 --> 00:54:40,845
Isn't capable of
staying up past 10,

835
00:54:40,911 --> 00:54:44,382
and I know that she has an
irrational fear of frogs.

836
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,885
- Frogs?
- Right. And Ruby M.,

837
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:51,422
I know that she has a secret
crush on her neighbor,

838
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,892
and I also could tell you
exactly how she orders pizza,

839
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:57,628
pepperoni, pineapple, no cheese.

840
00:54:57,695 --> 00:55:00,798
- No cheese?
- Exactly.

841
00:55:00,865 --> 00:55:05,603
So how is it that I know
so much about these girls,

842
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:09,407
but I never could have predicted

843
00:55:09,474 --> 00:55:12,276
they would do this to me?

844
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:16,947
Oh, come here. Oh.

845
00:55:17,014 --> 00:55:20,451
How they betrayed
me feels awful,

846
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:23,521
and it makes me not want to
be friends with them anymore,

847
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:29,588
but then I think about not
having them in my life, and...

848
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,930
And that feels worse.

849
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:41,238
You know, sometimes
friends outgrow each other,

850
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:43,941
and that's okay,

851
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:48,479
but try to understand
what was in their hearts

852
00:55:48,546 --> 00:55:50,448
and at least
consider forgiveness

853
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:53,451
before you walk away.

854
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:56,721
People make mistakes.

855
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,222
It was all just so much easier

856
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:02,292
when we were at the old
studio and you were our coach.

857
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,861
Now with my own team, I...

858
00:56:03,928 --> 00:56:08,633
I'm just afraid I'm going
to let everyone down.

859
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:12,937
- No way.
- You are a born leader, JoJo.

860
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,739
- Am I?
- Yes.

861
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:16,807
I just keep thinking
about nationals,

862
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,676
and I keep feeling
all this pressure.

863
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:21,779
Pressure to come up
with something different

864
00:56:21,846 --> 00:56:23,256
to set us apart
from everyone else.

865
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,383
You know, Coach Poppy,
she busted out jump ropes,

866
00:56:26,451 --> 00:56:29,820
and that really seemed
to wow the judges.

867
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:33,323
Yeah, well, she's
a doozy, all right.

868
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,192
I just feel like
we need something,

869
00:56:35,259 --> 00:56:38,929
something different to show
them how special we really are.

870
00:56:40,998 --> 00:56:43,200
I want you to close your eyes.

871
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:48,539
Go on.

872
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:50,875
Now I want you to envision

873
00:56:50,941 --> 00:56:53,410
what your ultimate dream
performance would be.

874
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:58,516
My ultimate dream performance.

875
00:56:58,583 --> 00:57:00,951
My ultimate dream performance.

876
00:57:04,622 --> 00:57:06,924
Singing.

877
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:09,760
It's always been my dream.

878
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:12,129
In my ultimate
dream performance,

879
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,532
it would be dancing and singing.

880
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,867
In front of a huge audience?

881
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:19,537
- How did you know?

882
00:57:19,604 --> 00:57:22,306
I was a kid just like you.

883
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:26,043
Too bad it's only a
dance competition.

884
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,479
Is it?

885
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:31,181
I mean, just because everybody
is doing things one way

886
00:57:31,248 --> 00:57:33,851
doesn't mean it's the
right way for you.

887
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:37,822
But what if they disqualify me

888
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,658
for doing things differently?

889
00:57:40,725 --> 00:57:44,762
Well, at least you gave
them your dream performance.

890
00:57:51,435 --> 00:57:54,539
Guys, I got a big
idea for nationals,

891
00:57:54,605 --> 00:57:56,774
but no risk, no reward.

892
00:57:56,841 --> 00:57:58,943
Are y'all with me? All: Yeah.

893
00:57:59,009 --> 00:58:01,045
Heck yeah! J Team on three!

894
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:03,781
One, two, three! All: J Team!

895
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,553
Five, six, seven, eight.

896
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:17,061
Awesome day, everybody.
J Team, whoo!

897
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:18,863
You guys are looking great.

898
00:58:18,929 --> 00:58:20,330
Thank you.

899
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:03,040
- JoJo!
- Whoa! Y'all scared me.

900
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:06,476
Sorry. We didn't want
to go in because...

901
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:12,282
- What are you guys doing here?
- Need some more moves?

902
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:14,349
Or are you here to uninvite
me to something else?

903
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:20,524
Sorry, I thought that was going
to feel better than it did.

904
00:59:25,195 --> 00:59:27,331
I feel awful about what
I did on my birthday.

905
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,833
I know.

906
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:33,671
I got your texts
and snaps, DMs, PMs

907
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:35,539
218 to be exact.

908
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:37,541
Coach Poppy invited
herself to my party,

909
00:59:37,608 --> 00:59:39,576
and I was too scared
to uninvite her

910
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:43,814
so instead I uninvited you.

911
00:59:43,881 --> 00:59:46,383
It's all right, Ruby.

912
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:47,718
It is?

913
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:50,020
Yeah. Friends outgrow
each other all the time.

914
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,488
No, JoJo, please.

915
00:59:51,555 --> 00:59:53,691
We were supposed to
be friends forever,

916
00:59:53,758 --> 00:59:54,725
apart or together.

917
00:59:54,792 --> 00:59:56,694
We are.

918
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:59,630
We were.

919
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:01,207
- Practicing your JoJo Jam?
- Oh, come on.

920
01:00:01,231 --> 01:00:02,943
I've been practicing
all week.

921
01:00:02,967 --> 01:00:06,036
- You're right.
- We messed up bad,

922
01:00:08,773 --> 01:00:10,207
and I'll understand

923
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:12,509
if you never want to be
friends with us again.

924
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,645
Good, great, terrific.

925
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:22,319
Where did you get that?

926
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:24,488
We took it out of the
trash and saved it.

927
01:00:24,554 --> 01:00:28,158
The three of us are a
team. We always have been,

928
01:00:28,225 --> 01:00:30,695
and we need to be on
the same team again.

929
01:00:30,761 --> 01:00:33,731
We want you to come back.

930
01:00:33,798 --> 01:00:35,833
Am I missing something here?

931
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,868
It's Coach Poppy
who calls the shots.

932
01:00:37,935 --> 01:00:40,004
She wants you back
on the team, too.

933
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,472
She said she made
a huge mistake.

934
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,842
Coach Poppy wants
me back on the team?

935
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:46,911
We all do. The whole team.

936
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:50,414
Even Nina said the team's not
the same without your sparkle.

937
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,682
We'll do anything

938
01:00:51,749 --> 01:00:54,084
if you'll just come back
and dance with us again.

939
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:55,361
Come on. Let's get out of here.

940
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,189
- Wait.
- Maybe it's not what we think.

941
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,835
My team does need a lot of work.

942
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:13,037
Let's go.

943
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,740
But I made a commitment to them.

944
01:01:15,806 --> 01:01:17,207
And Coach Poppy was right.

945
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:19,844
I do not belong in the P-PAC.

946
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:23,347
I'm me, and I like
bows and sparkles

947
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,850
and being exactly who I am.

948
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,317
And letting my team know

949
01:01:27,384 --> 01:01:30,054
that they should be exactly
who they want to be.

950
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:33,566
Do you think there's a way
we can still be friends?

951
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:39,590
Maybe, but I'm
still sad, and hurt.

952
01:01:39,964 --> 01:01:41,164
But we can try.

953
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,532
We'll take it.

954
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:46,070
And we promise we'll never
betray your trust again.

955
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:06,791
- Oh. Well, did...
- Did you get her back?

956
01:02:06,857 --> 01:02:09,693
Um. No.

957
01:02:11,261 --> 01:02:14,364
She said she doesn't want to
come back and be on the team.

958
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:19,403
-  Good.

959
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,238
Good?

960
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:24,074
- Well, yeah. Oh, come on.
- You didn't actually think

961
01:02:24,141 --> 01:02:25,876
she was going to leave
her team, did you?

962
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:32,482
Oh, cute! You did.

963
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:35,219
Well, then why did you
ask us to go get her back?

964
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,163
Because I wanted to poke
a few holes in that pesky

965
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:38,923
self-confidence
of hers. You know.

966
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,767
Make her wonder whether
she made the right choice,

967
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:43,127
and hopefully drive a wedge
between her and her team

968
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:45,162
as a bonus.

969
01:02:45,229 --> 01:02:46,763
We can't risk her winning.

970
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:50,835
You sent us to sabotage
our friend's team?

971
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:53,503
You used us.

972
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:56,807
Well, duh!

973
01:02:56,874 --> 01:03:01,178
I told you we were going
to win the nationals.

974
01:03:01,245 --> 01:03:03,647
And we will.

975
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:08,218
Hey, guys. What's the deal?

976
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,786
Nationals are just
a few days away.

977
01:03:09,854 --> 01:03:11,288
What do you care?

978
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:13,266
Don't you have another team
to go practice with now?

979
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,658
What are you talking about?

980
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,328
Your old team, who
doesn't need so much work.

981
01:03:18,395 --> 01:03:19,930
We know you're
going back to them.

982
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:22,166
We saw you with them at
Val's house this morning.

983
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:23,968
- Who? The Ruby's?
- Yeah.

984
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:25,469
The girls who stole your moves.

985
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:27,237
And didn't invite
you to their party.

986
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:28,873
Look. I know they messed up,

987
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:31,241
but they're my friends, too.

988
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,777
- People make mistakes.
- Yeah, we know.

989
01:03:33,844 --> 01:03:36,646
Just like the mistake we made
wasting our time on the J-Team.

990
01:03:36,713 --> 01:03:38,258
- No, no, no.
- Just hear me out, please.

991
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:41,018
- Go ahead.
- Go running off to your friends.

992
01:03:41,085 --> 01:03:42,486
Don't worry about us.

993
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:45,322
- Yeah.
- We'll make it easy for you.

994
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:46,891
We quit the J-Team.

995
01:03:46,957 --> 01:03:49,459
Jess. Pepper. Sunnie.

996
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:53,197
Guys, just hear me out. Wait.

997
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:06,510
- No thanks.
- I'm not in the mood.

998
01:04:09,613 --> 01:04:12,049
Any of the J-Team
answer your calls?

999
01:04:12,116 --> 01:04:15,519
Not yet, but I'll keep trying.

1000
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:19,890
- How did I get here?
- I have no team to perform with,

1001
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:23,193
but even worse, I let
all of my friends down.

1002
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,896
- JoJo.
- I never meant to hurt anyone.

1003
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:27,231
I know that.

1004
01:04:27,297 --> 01:04:30,867
All I ever wanted
to do is perform.

1005
01:04:30,935 --> 01:04:36,935
But, now I feel like the
universe is telling me not to.

1006
01:04:37,341 --> 01:04:41,778
Do I just listen
and give it all up?

1007
01:04:41,845 --> 01:04:46,783
Do you remember that day
I gave you your first bow.

1008
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:49,619
You were so upset you couldn't
nail your triple pirouette

1009
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:53,090
you wanted to quit.

1010
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:55,059
But once you had
that bow in your hair

1011
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:57,527
and the music started,

1012
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,696
there was no stopping you.

1013
01:04:59,763 --> 01:05:01,565
I think I practiced
all day and night

1014
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:03,767
until I wore a hole
in my kitchen floor.

1015
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,604
I remember. Nothing's changed.

1016
01:05:07,671 --> 01:05:10,840
If you really want to perform,

1017
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:13,743
nothing will stop you.

1018
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,402
From all of the noise.

1019
01:06:45,469 --> 01:06:46,936
Might fall.

1020
01:08:02,512 --> 01:08:05,014
Ha. Well, well, well.

1021
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,350
Look what we have here.

1022
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:09,119
It's JoJo, everybody.
What does she have on?

1023
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:10,520
Hey, guys.

1024
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,997
You know, I was
really bummed to hear

1025
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:15,192
that you didn't want to
come back and join us.

1026
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:17,227
Where's the rest of the J-Team.

1027
01:08:17,294 --> 01:08:20,197
Oh. It's just me that'll
be competing today.

1028
01:08:20,264 --> 01:08:22,899
The rest of my team quit.

1029
01:08:22,966 --> 01:08:26,170
- Oh.
- I'm really sorry to hear that.

1030
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:27,737
Thanks.

1031
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:30,574
It's okay, though, because
I'm still going to perform.

1032
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,908
I love performing.

1033
01:08:31,975 --> 01:08:34,043
My favorite thing, ever.
Nothing can stop me.

1034
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,880
- Cute. Good luck with that.
- Moving on!

1035
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:48,425
And now, the P-PAC!

1036
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,833
- We're about to start.
- Where are the Rubies?

1037
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,569
I don't know. I've looked
for them everywhere.

1038
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,614
What are you doing here?
You should be on the stage.

1039
01:09:01,638 --> 01:09:03,773
- Go back out there, Sheena.
- It's Nina!

1040
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:08,077
- Sheena be working my nerves.
- I swear I ain't gonna let her.

1041
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:08,805
- Ha ha!
- The Ruby's parts

1042
01:10:08,872 --> 01:10:10,250
- are coming up.
- I know. Hold this.

1043
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:11,541
Turn around.

1044
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:13,085
I've got to put this
on me for one second.

1045
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:14,454
You know what? You're going
to have to cover for them.

1046
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:15,345
- But I don't know their parts.
- Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:10:15,412 --> 01:10:16,846
The show must go on, Trina.

1048
01:10:16,913 --> 01:10:18,114
- Nina!
- Who cares.

1049
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:20,650
My part isn't over!

1050
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,757
- Yeah, Honey!
- That is my girl...

1051
01:10:27,824 --> 01:10:29,259
Get me down! Get me down!

1052
01:10:29,326 --> 01:10:31,595
Ahh! What's your name?
What's your name? Help me!

1053
01:10:31,661 --> 01:10:35,799
Help me! Oh!
Ooh! Ooh!

1054
01:10:35,865 --> 01:10:38,134
That was unexpected.

1055
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:41,237
I always knew she had a
little sparkle on the inside.

1056
01:10:46,443 --> 01:10:49,212
Well, you're next, kid.

1057
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:52,582
Val. I don't know if I
can do it. Not alone.

1058
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:54,150
Yes, you can.

1059
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:55,926
But it's a team
competition, and we're...

1060
01:10:55,985 --> 01:10:58,855
Listen. None of that matters.

1061
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,990
Winning isn't the goal anymore.

1062
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:04,761
And now, please
welcome The J-Team.

1063
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:07,130
- You remember that ultimate

1064
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,299
performance you imagined?

1065
01:11:09,366 --> 01:11:13,537
Your only goal now is to
go out there and do it.

1066
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,205
Just live your dream.

1067
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:20,744
Just live my dream.

1068
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:26,810
We love you J-Team!

1069
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:08,738
What made you guys
change your mind?

1070
01:15:08,805 --> 01:15:10,373
The Rubies told us everything.

1071
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,417
We should have listened to
you when you tried to explain.

1072
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:14,654
We just assumed you'd want
to go back to your old team,

1073
01:15:14,678 --> 01:15:17,480
because you'd have a
better chance at winning.

1074
01:15:17,547 --> 01:15:19,115
Are you kidding me?

1075
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:22,518
Whatever the result of this
competition, I already won.

1076
01:15:22,586 --> 01:15:24,453
- Pardon me. Make way.
- Coming through.

1077
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:26,656
Hi. I need to
speak to a manager.

1078
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:28,668
How very dare of you to put
the rest of us to shame.

1079
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:29,993
Why do we even bother.

1080
01:15:30,059 --> 01:15:32,528
- Aw, stop it Desi.
- Your team was amazing.

1081
01:15:32,596 --> 01:15:34,598
What I want to know is
how you did that one move.

1082
01:15:34,664 --> 01:15:37,166
The one where you're
like "bam, oomf, cappa."

1083
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,369
- That's the JoJo Jam.
- Of course it is.

1084
01:15:40,436 --> 01:15:42,171
I demand you teach
it to me ASAP.

1085
01:15:42,238 --> 01:15:44,908
- Anything for you, my friend.
- I knew her first, girls.

1086
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:51,781
- Here you go, Jess.
- Woah!

1087
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:55,384
- Yeah!

1088
01:15:57,954 --> 01:16:00,289
And Pepper, this bow is for you,

1089
01:16:00,356 --> 01:16:03,727
'cause it's spicy,
just like you are.

1090
01:16:03,793 --> 01:16:07,096
- Oh, yeah.

1091
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:08,965
Each one of these
bows is unique.

1092
01:16:09,032 --> 01:16:10,834
Just like all of you.

1093
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,770
It represents how
we're all different,

1094
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:16,740
but we're all on the same team.

1095
01:16:16,806 --> 01:16:20,476
- Congrats, J-Team.
- Yeah, you guys were awesome.

1096
01:16:20,543 --> 01:16:22,979
Did Poppy kick you off the team?

1097
01:16:23,046 --> 01:16:24,648
She tried to, but we quit first.

1098
01:16:24,714 --> 01:16:25,949
Mm-hmm.

1099
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:28,151
Well, technically
she kicked us off

1100
01:16:28,217 --> 01:16:30,654
while we were quitting, but
that's besides the point.

1101
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:31,955
- It was mutual.

1102
01:16:32,021 --> 01:16:34,390
JoJo. We wanted ask...

1103
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:36,125
And it's cool if
you want to say no,

1104
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:38,862
we'll totally understand.

1105
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:40,997
Can we be on the J-Team?

1106
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:47,403
Well, since we are on our way

1107
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,538
to the First
Position Competition.

1108
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:54,477
World Championships.

1109
01:16:54,543 --> 01:16:58,447
I think we could use a
few extra J-Team ladies.

1110
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:03,386
- All right, you guys.
- We've got a lot of work to do.

1111
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:05,254
So we should get
started right away.

1112
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:06,656
Are you guys warmed up.

1113
01:17:06,723 --> 01:17:07,991
All: Yes.

1114
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:10,393
Good, 'cause it's time to party!

1115
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:43,512
- J-Team! J-Team! J-Team!
