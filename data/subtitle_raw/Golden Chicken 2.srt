1
00:00:35,168 --> 00:00:38,934
Hong Kong, 2003

2
00:00:44,477 --> 00:00:51,144
Hong Kong, 2046

3
00:00:51,317 --> 00:00:52,409
You found him yet?

4
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,382
No... the Peak is a huge place

5
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:59,183
He sounded quite unstable
over the phone

6
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,723
Careful with what you say to him

7
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,661
Also... don't ever tell him who you are

8
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:09,926
I know, I know... you talk
too much as a 90-year-old

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,228
Tung Chee Hwa Memorial?

10
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,469
Probably a dead end street

11
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:40,394
We have to invest
in the Hong Kong Dollars!

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,836
Just sell all US Dollars and buy HKD...

13
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:53,072
Delete one year...

14
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,906
Delete two years...

15
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,711
Might as well delete them all!

16
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,249
Nah, one year is good enough

17
00:02:09,162 --> 00:02:11,687
But I've only known Lucy for two months

18
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,928
Hey! My pills...

19
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,561
What are you doing with my pills,
old lady?

20
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:26,437
Pardon me! I'm supposed to look 35!
I spent millions on plastic surgery

21
00:02:26,613 --> 00:02:28,843
Which part of me looks like an old lady?

22
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,843
Which part of you doesn't?

23
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,317
You sound like one, you walk like one

24
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,921
And you smell like one

25
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,350
Gimme a break, I'm over 80 years old

26
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:44,156
I knew it! Why looking 35 anyway?

27
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,423
You can't fool anyone

28
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,132
So easy to rip off an old granny

29
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,667
Just give me back my pills

30
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,067
Don't take these pills

31
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,937
It will wipe out your memory

32
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,611
That is exactly what I want to do

33
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,906
My girlfriend dumped me

34
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,346
I've been dumped more times
than I can count

35
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,022
You've been dumped too?

36
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:20,159
It's no big deal young man

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,602
Looking back on all my years, even the
saddest one offers sweet memories

38
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:33,206
Let me tell you about the year 2003

39
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,539
2003?

40
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,777
That's the toughest year for
Hong Kong people to swallow

41
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:59,263
This chicken looks like you

42
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:01,431
How much is it?

43
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:03,339
It's got a huge breast!

44
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,818
Go to hell!

45
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,787
This is a temple for god's sake!
What' you think you're doing?

46
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,023
It was an accident...

47
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,429
What's going on?

48
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,301
Wow, fat boy, you really scored

49
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,565
But it slipped!
No kidding.

50
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,298
How about a New Year cash pocket?

51
00:04:36,476 --> 00:04:38,000
Just one pocket?!

52
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,145
She deserves more!
Her cup size is 34C!

53
00:04:40,813 --> 00:04:44,271
Bad number.
,
out... another bad number. out
,

54
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,946
Good number. in!
,

55
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:49,848
All the best numbers are here

56
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,322
Remember...
Don't worry, there won't be any mix up

57
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,724
Excuse me... coming through...
pardon me...

58
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,101
Hey, mister, got a light?

59
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:04,860
Sure

60
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,266
Thank you!

61
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,442
What's going on?

62
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:21,042
Please give Kum a lucky number
and a happy new year

63
00:05:24,057 --> 00:05:25,354
Better be a lucky one!

64
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,257
Number 4... bad luck!

65
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,255
Here we go again... come on,
lucky number...

66
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:38,333
Number 10, good enough! Thank you!

67
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,034
Kum...
What number did you get?

68
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,766
The best number of course

69
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:46,342
Excellent!

70
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,448
I'm gonna be rich n' famous!

71
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:51,514
Someone is taking pictures there

72
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:52,743
Is it a movie star?

73
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:56,752
I know him!
Who's he?

74
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:59,288
The new Secretary for Home Affairs
Dr Patrick Ho

75
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:03,660
His wife was once a famous star

76
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,165
Dr. Ho too become famous having
made history that day

77
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,808
Like all former Secretaries. Ho came to
draw the number of luck for Hong Kong

78
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,035
But since I took all
good numbers reserved

79
00:06:19,278 --> 00:06:22,714
for him. he scored the lowest of the low!

80
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,316
We... we all try our best for Hong Kong...

81
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,583
I win!

82
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:33,320
You're winning too much! Get up
before everyone starts to hate you

83
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:35,619
Hurry, hurry...

84
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:40,196
C'mon...

85
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,665
Fanny...
Yes

86
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,598
Bring in all the gifts from the outside

87
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,863
Son of a bitch!

88
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,904
Watch you mouth

89
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,411
My in-law doesn't know
that I was an escort

90
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:53,876
Try to act like a lady

91
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:57,014
Fresh chick on the farm!

92
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:01,449
Congratulations! I'm so happy!

93
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:08,024
Here, $500 a pop... nope,
$1000 a pop! This is the last pop!

94
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:14,429
It feels like the good old days
working in the night club

95
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:19,264
But we're wearing the real jewels
tonight and no more dildos

96
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:20,461
Snack?

97
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,837
How about Karaoke?
Okedoke. Karoke!

98
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,010
But it's late!

99
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:27,772
Darn. it's because of this new hairdo.
it took me hours to set

100
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,141
I could have popped 3 customers
and made a bundle

101
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,543
Quite a dress you get there

102
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:37,245
You notice?! It's some Italian designer
called Ferfanla something

103
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,584
You dressed well too back then
stealing all my limelight

104
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:44,058
How come you breasts
get so big and soft?

105
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,663
Perhaps you want some noodles?

106
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:47,730
No thanks, I'm full

107
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:51,563
BB Lin.
what happened to your Big Breasts?!

108
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:52,795
Go away!

109
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:57,802
How come these breasts
... is one sided?

110
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,338
My mother-in-law!

111
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,476
Congratulations, ma'am!

112
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:06,175
Honest to god, this one breast
you still got is in mint condition!

113
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:07,409
Enough!

114
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,914
Let's play mahjong!

115
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:14,716
I haven't played in a long time

116
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:16,385
How about $120 for a game?

117
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,224
Why is everybody going to
the toilet all of a sudden?

118
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,990
Or am I waging too little?

119
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,265
Gimme a bowl of crab meat noodle

120
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,763
But the banquet is starting, ma'am

121
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,068
But I want noodles! I am hungry now!

122
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,050
Kum

123
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,051
They're serving shark's fin! Come eat

124
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,629
Nah...

125
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,463
You crapping or what?

126
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,670
Cut the crap and grow up, girl

127
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,206
You are like a sister to me

128
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,548
You too shall get married
and settle down one day

129
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:33,705
It's the best number in this temple!

130
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,672
It says you're getting married this year

131
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,210
That's crazy! With whom?

132
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,940
Just find someone! Or you'll be cursed

133
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,846
But you've just say I got the best number!

134
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:48,915
It's a curse

135
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,784
You sure
you're any making sense here?!

136
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:55,118
Reading fortune sticks is a
very complicated science

137
00:09:55,294 --> 00:09:57,319
I am Mr. Wong, not Mr. Wrong

138
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,396
If it didn't come true. come
kick my ass next year!

139
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:11,499
So I shall get married this year?

140
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,610
To be an eligible potential bride...

141
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,044
... I shall become someone proper

142
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:23,621
Starting with getting myself a proper job

143
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,590
Kum, stocking up condoms?

144
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,289
Kum, I saw your new pornsite!

145
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:38,525
Kum, great costume! Let's do more
role-play at your place later tonight

146
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:41,501
Forget to tell you, this is
buy-one-get-one-free

147
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,003
I'm only here to buy Pomlemon drink

148
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,437
It's on the other aisle. Kum!

149
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:46,644
A bit further...

150
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,647
I thought I was a low-key prostitute

151
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,684
Turns out. I was red hot

152
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,555
Subject to popular demand, I returned
to my improper trade

153
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:09,866
Kum.

154
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:12,861
Mr. Chow!

155
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:17,169
You've scared me... what are
you doing here so late?

156
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,241
It's Chinese Valentine's day today

157
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:23,405
Since we are both lonesome singles,
I've come to cook you a good meal

158
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:26,574
Let's have some
good family fun together

159
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,045
Let me help you

160
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:31,280
No need, just go take off your clothes!
I'll fetch you when I'm done

161
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:40,159
Kum, you're like my soul mate,
but fate keeps us apart

162
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,435
That's quite a presumption...
Afraid to be stuck with me?

163
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:49,239
No. but I don't want to be
a burden to you

164
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,275
Those who sail together have
acquainted for a hundred years

165
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:54,970
Those who sleep together have
acquainted for a thousand

166
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:59,173
What we've been through in bed
practically makes us husband and wife

167
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:02,016
Let's drink to that

168
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,087
You're so strange today

169
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:09,227
You served me dinner
and read me poetry

170
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,453
What's up with you?

171
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:18,800
A loving man in a loveless world
...how can love be endured?

172
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,500
Endure what?

173
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,635
Oh... my stomach is feeling funny...

174
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,142
Mr. Chow, you done?... Hurry!

175
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,109
Wait!

176
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,647
Did you wash your hands before
you cook or what?... Quick!

177
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,416
Use this first, I just took
a dump and it stinks inside!

178
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,020
You must be kidding!

179
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,618
Why don't you turn on the ventilator?

180
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,793
I'll crap in the kitchen,
don't you come in!

181
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,458
Kum!

182
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,800
You've scared me twice tonight!

183
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,871
Let's do something kinky tonight
Like what?

184
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,404
It's a new SM mask

185
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,205
Put it on... you look better already

186
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,539
I feel like an astronaut

187
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,649
It's so much fun
Already too much, Mr. Chow

188
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,613
I can't hear you

189
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,309
Let's take turn wearing it

190
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,751
Wait for me in bed with your eyes shut

191
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,647
You're really strange tonight

192
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:39,775
Still not done yet?
Almost!

193
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,513
You're panting hard and coughing too!
Perhaps we should stop

194
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:45,680
Don't talk, keep going!

195
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,285
Let's have a break, or someone will die...

196
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,093
Let's take a break

197
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,629
What's that smell?

198
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,026
So smoky...

199
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:00,565
What have you done?

200
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,666
You're out of your mind!

201
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,575
Why are you burning coal in my house?

202
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:14,275
What's wrong with you?

203
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,448
Mr. Chow, are you trying to kill yourself?

204
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,089
Why?

205
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:24,753
I just want to have fun before I die

206
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,055
You want me to die with you?

207
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:28,665
No, you won't

208
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,598
With the mask on, you would be okay

209
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,070
You're so silly... there's nothing
that can't be resolved

210
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:44,380
Business at my diner
is hitting rock bottom

211
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,518
I owe people tons of money

212
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:52,249
Only death can rid me of my troubles

213
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:58,352
I have some savings, I can lend you a bit

214
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,464
Really? No wonder...

215
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:05,126
It's always dark
before the sun comes up

216
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:09,900
Kum, you're one in a million

217
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,978
I promise to you, I'll never let you down

218
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:20,346
I'll make you a business partner
you will become a boss

219
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,388
A boss?

220
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:33,595
No one would hire me anyway.
this way, I can hire myself

221
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,427
Yes! I'll help you!

222
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,500
You are so kind!

223
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,700
Are you getting your second wind?

224
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,075
Just to return your favor!

225
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,571
Let's strike while it's still hot

226
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:53,044
Kum

227
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,810
Mr. Chow.

228
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,354
I'm dying...

229
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,455
Is it good?

230
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:20,077
New Suicide Venue:
Charcoal Grilling at One-Chick-Brothel

231
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,475
I finally become the boss
of Chow's Diner

232
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,445
Unfortunately, the first customer
I served was SARS

233
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,546
How dare you shaving
your legs in the public!

234
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:36,320
But the latest research says that
body hair carries the most germs!

235
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,788
Armpit too?!
You becoming a woman or what?

236
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,796
Rather be a living woman
than a dead man

237
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:51,142
Got to wash hands for 15 seconds...

238
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,242
1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10...

239
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,724
I'm so very clean!

240
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:08,724
Not a strand of hair left
I'm snow white clean!!

241
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,554
I'm silky n' smooth n' creamy like lard

242
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:14,961
I could have made
the best of custard tart

243
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,292
So you became a boss, that's cool

244
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:25,273
Not really...when SARS attacked,
every thing went into a coma

245
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,841
Many people died too

246
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:31,838
People died?

247
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,642
Yes! SARS was a real killer.

248
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:39,188
How can people die from SARS? I too
have caught it several times this year

249
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,688
One pill usually takes care of it

250
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,858
I was talking about 40 odd years ago!

251
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,826
Next thing you' gonna say is
cancer killed too

252
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:48,522
Of course cancer killed!

253
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,135
Back then...

254
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,300
Everybody went crazy

255
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,476
Hong Kong is under the attack of SARS

256
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:07,652
12 more people died of SARS today

257
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,685
5 had no complications
with any other diseases

258
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,414
31 more cases are confirmed
with SARS infection today

259
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,425
Antibody to the virus is still not found
in any human subjects

260
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:20,189
One Cathay Pacific flight attendant
was confirmed with SARS infection

261
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,196
The death toll continues to rise steadily

262
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:24,801
With the addition of 6 new
deaths reported yesterday...

263
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,336
The overall fatality rate is reaching 6%

264
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,971
I've got customer!

265
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,416
Don't close the shop till I get back

266
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:42,551
4 minutes and 48...4 minutes and 49...

267
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,190
4 minutes and 50...4 minutes and 51...

268
00:18:46,391 --> 00:18:47,255
Coming...

269
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,551
No rush, take it easy

270
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,723
You... aren't you...

271
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,925
I work part-time in the diner downstairs

272
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,196
Sorry to keep you waiting

273
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:02,969
Don't you remember me?

274
00:19:05,077 --> 00:19:06,806
Sure, you're one of my regulars!

275
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,072
Scrub your shoes on the sterilizing
mat before you come in

276
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,208
Better be safe than sorry

277
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,049
This way please... and your name?

278
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,618
I am Chan

279
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:17,751
Nice place
Can I take your temperature?

280
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:19,385
You don't mind, do you?

281
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:20,582
Let me take yours too...

282
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,193
I have my own...

283
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:24,620
Your thermometer is nice

284
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:26,931
D.I.Y.?
Sure

285
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,167
37.3 degrees Celsius

286
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,405
I win, 97 degrees, Fahrenheit

287
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,533
We are both fine then!
Let's take a shower

288
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,075
With germs everywhere, I'd better
shampoo your hair too

289
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:46,649
Take off your glasses

290
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,843
Be careful with my eyes
Of course.

291
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:56,628
In the meantime. can we start
Sure

292
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,823
Please scrub my back
Okay

293
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,695
Are you comfy?
Very...

294
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,599
Do you want a head massage?
Yes... and no!

295
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:09,036
I can't see clearly with you wearing this

296
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:10,605
What do you want to see?

297
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,405
Which hand of yours is holding
the scrub? Right hand

298
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:19,016
How about using your left and hold
the faucet with your right?

299
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,784
What are you doing?

300
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,290
How come you don't have any hair?
I've shaved it off

301
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,722
Fatty's chicken is shedding quills

302
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:38,162
Fatso's dog is barking for a meal

303
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:41,300
Fatty explodes all the way

304
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:44,241
She calls the police
and makes Fatso pay

305
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:47,707
My...you're quite a bathroom singer!

306
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:50,507
I sing in public toilets too
got quite a reputation for that!

307
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:51,706
Really? Keep singing!

308
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,579
Fatty's chicken is shedding quills

309
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,846
Fatso's dog is barking for a meal

310
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,719
Fatty explodes all the way

311
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:03,892
She calls the police
and makes Fatso pay

312
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,889
Don't just watch me, bathe me

313
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:10,497
Let me scrub you down there then

314
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,037
Can you use the side with sponge?

315
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,964
Feel better now?
Much better

316
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,842
Come here
What are we doing the Saran wrap?

317
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:24,846
Who knows
if sweats won't transmit SARS? TRUE

318
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,813
It's much safer this way right?
Right

319
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,713
You can even lose weight
Quite right

320
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,047
Let's switch side
Why?

321
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,746
Why don't you stand there and
I'll wrap myself towards you

322
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,061
With the Saran wrap
and the anti-SARS soup

323
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:40,856
we're all set to have safe sex

324
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:46,927
Soup?... I haven't had soup in
a long time, my dear wife

325
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,466
So you are into husband and wife?

326
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:59,709
Why not wrap it down there too, honey?
Be Careful

327
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,814
Don't break it though

328
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,815
Enough?

329
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,321
No, you need a lot of
wrapping down there

330
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,483
It's too tight!
I'll loosen it up...

331
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:11,456
Better?

332
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,976
How come...

333
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:32,374
... I don't see any hair here?

334
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,412
How come you are hairless?

335
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,663
What's wrong?

336
00:22:47,432 --> 00:22:50,993
I am really tired... can I rest for a while?

337
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:53,261
But I'm ready for...

338
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:58,932
That was quick!

339
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:08,615
The SARS outbreak at the Amoy
Garden Complex is escalating

340
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,278
185 residents have been infected so far

341
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:12,718
The Health Department quarantined
Amoy's contaminated

342
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,882
Block E at 6am today...

343
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,594
...imposing a 10 days segregation
to all Block E residents

344
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:22,598
All access to the building is denied
Mother...

345
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,969
Amoy is quarantined!
How can I go home?!

346
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:29,498
Home?
I live in Amoy Garden Block E!

347
00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:34,912
Amoy Block E?!!!
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

348
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,219
What're you doing in my bathroom?!!!

349
00:23:42,621 --> 00:23:43,485
Gotta look for hair

350
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:47,557
Don't ruin my bathroom! Come out!

351
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,185
C'mon out!!

352
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:54,727
What happened to your hair?

353
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,599
Let's make a deal, I'll take you
as a regular after you're cured

354
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,365
If I can't see it, perhaps I can taste it!

355
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,639
Where can I find hair?!

356
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:17,779
Don't crap in my toilet or you'll
pass me your SARS virus

357
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,820
Don't give me any SARS crap!

358
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:24,789
C'mon out!!

359
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,959
This isn't body hair!

360
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,464
Help! Someone's crapping!

361
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:36,435
Help!

362
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:40,737
I need some time to think about
how to rescue my mum!

363
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:45,713
How about $500 a day for room
and board without sex!

364
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,650
Let me stay, I know you're very kind...

365
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,946
I slept with him already

366
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,852
If he is indeed a carrier. it wouldn't
help even if I threw him out now

367
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,921
Above all, he's paying more than
what the diner can earn...

368
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,288
Deal!

369
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,701
Black bean ribs on rice to go, please

370
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,741
You want the soup of the day as well?

371
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,243
We have anti-SARS
pig lungs soup today

372
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,346
I'll have iced tea

373
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,978
Black bean ribs on rice...

374
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:25,112
... and iced tea to go!

375
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,523
That's the doctor who took
care of granny last year!

376
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,995
You recognize him with the mask on?

377
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:37,668
It's him!
His hospital is now a SARS ward!

378
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,027
Let's go!

379
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,002
Keep the change

380
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:52,146
Sorry, I'll wait outside

381
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:02,425
Bloody, now I have to sterilize
the whole place all over again

382
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,835
I'm sorry to have troubled you

383
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,597
No, not at all

384
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,766
Doc, do you live nearby?
How come I've never seen you?

385
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,271
Well, I can't return home these days and
I've rented a place around here to crash

386
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,143
I saw you guys on TV

387
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:30,651
You guys don't go home for
fear of infecting your family

388
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,159
There's no one left inside.
come eat inside

389
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,996
Come...
I'd rather not trouble your staff

390
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,962
Come...

391
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:45,732
You chicken shit!
I don't want to die...

392
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,638
I believe that the disease can
only be transmitted by droplets

393
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:50,604
Thank you

394
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:53,073
I'll have soup ready for you tomorrow too

395
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:57,738
Cold drinks kind of weaken your lungs

396
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,552
If you're making soup with pig's lungs,
make sure it's clean and fully cooked

397
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,188
How about cleaning it
with diluted bleach...

398
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:06,889
Bye

399
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,187
Bye

400
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:15,162
He has some pretty eyes...
wonder if he has buck teeth

401
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,597
Get me pig's lungs tomorrow!

402
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,331
What's this pain all over?

403
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:25,736
Am I infected?

404
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,807
Perhaps some Vitamin C
can suppress it

405
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,648
Gimme your wallet!

406
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:41,755
Gimme money!

407
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:44,561
Nah... Let's try Bruce Lee

408
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:05,775
One. two. three...

409
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,996
We're living
in different ends of the world

410
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,632
You live your own life, and I live mine

411
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,140
If we ever get to run into each
other on the street one day

412
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:41,176
We might nod to one another...

413
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:44,945
...and then, fall speechless

414
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:50,350
Because I might no longer know you

415
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:54,465
All I have in my mind is that...

416
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:58,299
...I miss you

417
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:10,270
Who made me fall in love so deeply...

418
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:16,852
...made me as gentle as clear water...

419
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:23,254
...offered me tranquility...

420
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:29,865
...freed me from my constrains...

421
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:35,971
...reminded me of my innocent dreams

422
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:43,279
...redeemed my heart and soul...

423
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:53,788
...and let me fall asleep in peace

424
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,989
What are you doing?

425
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:36,356
Why did you rub my armpit with brandy?!

426
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:40,163
Brandy can boost your hair growth

427
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:41,928
Let's wait n' see

428
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:45,033
You, pervert!

429
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,103
I'm dying here, and you're
putting a nail to my coffin?!

430
00:30:51,716 --> 00:30:56,119
Gimme a break! Go find
yourself a hairy chick!

431
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,480
You're sick?

432
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,820
I am dying!

433
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,818
I could be having SARS...

434
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:08,054
Don't die, honey...

435
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:10,860
Don't leave me!

436
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:16,697
I have an idea!

437
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,808
Wait for me. I will be back soon!

438
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,478
Get in!
Keep quiet!

439
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,310
Kum!... you keep quiet!

440
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:27,975
What is it?
Kum...

441
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,084
What are you doing?

442
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:32,587
I've brought you Hong Kong's
best SARS doctor. Dr Man Ko!

443
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:36,055
Why cover his head with a plastic bag?

444
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,889
Not just one! Here's another one!

445
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,131
Take it off!

446
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,893
And one more
from the convenient store!

447
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,034
Let me take it off

448
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:50,065
You're not the Dr Ko I saw on TV!
Dr Ko ain't handsome!

449
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,641
I'm Dr Ko. W. Man: not Ko. F. Man

450
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:55,409
But it says Ko, F. Man
on your clinic door!

451
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,241
It says Ko, W. Man!

452
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,543
F. for Forever Man, W for Water Man!

453
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,243
What 'you doing?...
Pardon me. excuse me

454
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,948
Hurry up and let him go,
you troublemaker!

455
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,658
What...Wait...!

456
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:11,660
Can't you see she is very sick?
You're a doctor! Go help her!

457
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:12,557
No...

458
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,891
Get into the room...Go diagnose her!

459
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:19,234
Excellent! Lots of ear wax...

460
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:25,172
Good girl...

461
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,106
Okay...

462
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:30,678
Lots of eye crust...

463
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:33,082
Okay... good girl...

464
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,287
Lots of snort too...

465
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:48,558
Turn over

466
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:53,535
Hold still, let me feel the stomach

467
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,432
Got any diarrhea?

468
00:32:55,606 --> 00:32:56,129
No...

469
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,000
Constipation?

470
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:57,732
No

471
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,342
Of course not!
Smelt your own stool?

472
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:02,012
Smelt others?

473
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:03,703
You're nuts! I've never!

474
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,041
Tasted your own stool?

475
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:06,181
Hell, no!

476
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,514
Tasted the others?

477
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,812
You think I'm crazy? Of course I didn't!!!

478
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:12,887
Hold... good girl!

479
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:13,955
Hold her

480
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,820
I'm going to take her temperature

481
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,354
Wow!! Pretty Girl! Yeah!!

482
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:21,759
Why do you have to stick it there?

483
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:27,863
Why are you blowing into my ass?!

484
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,338
I have to blow your hair out of my way

485
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,308
But she is hairless

486
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:37,073
Is this a prank or what?!
Are you two are in this together?!

487
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,478
Are you really a doctor?!
Of course I am

488
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,618
Where did you go to school?
Hong Kong University!

489
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,556
I have a PHD degree!
I am a veterinarian!

490
00:33:45,823 --> 00:33:46,812
You mean vegetarian?

491
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:49,425
Veterinarian, not vegetarian!!

492
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,721
What is that?
Animal Doctor, stupid!

493
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,263
Who's stupid?!

494
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,168
Yet. I'm still a doctor
I can identify a common cold

495
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,496
She didn't cough
throughout the examination

496
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:04,971
It isn't SARS, just a cold

497
00:34:05,276 --> 00:34:06,106
By the way...

498
00:34:07,011 --> 00:34:13,246
Your gun looks exactly like a dummy,
but your love for your wife is so very real

499
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:14,476
Good!

500
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:15,611
You're fine then!

501
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,889
Happy Diner!

502
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,526
Pork chop on rice and the soup
of the day to go please

503
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,430
Doctor Mask?

504
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,961
I'll wait outside
Oke-doke!

505
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:38,935
Pork chop on rice!

506
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,271
Extra slice of pork chop and
an extra large bowl of soup!

507
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,013
Please sit...

508
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:56,022
Here's the soup... I cleaned
the pig lungs very well

509
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,856
I cooked it with bleach!

510
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,798
Just kidding... but it's extremely cooked

511
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,593
Come have a seat

512
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,497
Thanks
Have some soup.

513
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,768
You guys must be exhausted?

514
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,733
It's been very tense for
all of us at the hospital

515
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,674
It's like we are going to snap anytime

516
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,978
I used to be a masseuse

517
00:35:19,317 --> 00:35:20,909
Let me give you a back rub

518
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:22,074
It will loosen you up

519
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,345
No need...

520
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,156
Boss! Pork chop on rice

521
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:30,954
So fast? You sure it's cooked?

522
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,424
Is it hot enough?

523
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:33,621
It's micro-waved

524
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,992
I'll give you a massage next time then

525
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:43,133
My wife... used to give me
massages once in a while

526
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,704
But you don't see her lately

527
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,378
You've got to release your stress

528
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:55,478
A good meal will do just that

529
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:57,685
Okay

530
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,983
I forgot to pay you last time

531
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,750
How much?
No need

532
00:36:01,926 --> 00:36:03,291
My treat

533
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,462
My compliment to the ground
zero medical workers

534
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,430
Finish the soup first

535
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,433
Since then, he dropped
by almost every night

536
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,635
I did the talking most of the time

537
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,501
And he just listened

538
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,768
I thought we got to know
each other really well

539
00:36:20,044 --> 00:36:22,911
But I'm not sure if the feeling is mutual

540
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:56,209
Ouch?! That hurts!

541
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,547
What are you doing?

542
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,678
How come your hair still hasn't grown?

543
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,911
Pervert! You've almost torn off my skin!

544
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,484
That's impossible

545
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,058
Let me see

546
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,057
You bloody pervert!!!

547
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:14,491
Honey...

548
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,463
Let go! I don't want to go down with you!

549
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:21,863
Don't go! I'll find work!
Please don't leave me!

550
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:24,370
I have done this before I married you

551
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,736
If I can do it, what do you care?

552
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,843
Just wait a little, we will be okay soon

553
00:37:29,013 --> 00:37:31,607
I doubt if the loan sharks will wait for you

554
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,147
Let go!
Don't go!

555
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,978
Don't...

556
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,312
Don't what?

557
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,919
Don't be a prostitute!

558
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:40,319
But I do that for a living

559
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,991
No husbands would want
their wife to prostitute

560
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,128
I can't lose you, please...

561
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:49,532
Did your wife become a prostitute?

562
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,227
Honey!

563
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,669
We've gone through
so much to be together

564
00:37:57,842 --> 00:37:59,833
Don't you give up now!

565
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,339
Honey...

566
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,423
Her hair?

567
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,767
Honey

568
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:38,643
Why did you leave me with
only a single strand of hair?

569
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:43,877
Your wife left you

570
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,047
She became a prostitute

571
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,326
And left you a single hair

572
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,161
What am I saying?!

573
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:58,501
I can't lose you, honey...

574
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,772
He's such a sad soul

575
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,238
I really wanted to help

576
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,874
While I was off-air...

577
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,206
A friend and I talked over
the issue of Vitamin C

578
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,008
We've come up with an idea
that when classes resume...

579
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:16,585
We can sponsor a bottle of
Vitamin-C to each student

580
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:19,585
The Health authority thinks that...

581
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,122
During the epidemic,
Radio Cheng inspired movements like

582
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,693
A mask for a citizen

583
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,420
An orange for a senior

584
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,328
& A bottle (of Vitamin C) for a kid

585
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:35,164
He also inspired me on how
to help Chan find his wife

586
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,965
I too started a movement called
A strand of hair for a bowl of soup

587
00:39:43,614 --> 00:39:46,174
I placed an ad on the Escort Chicks'
Website asking my peers to show up

588
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,250
With a strand of her body hair
in her hand...

589
00:39:48,419 --> 00:39:50,979
... any woman would be entitled
to a free bowl of soup

590
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:54,784
I could have never guessed that
so many sisters turned up...

591
00:39:54,992 --> 00:40:00,055
...under the scrutiny of public
eyes just for a bowl of soup

592
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,366
Obviously, it was a really
difficult time for everyone

593
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,372
Hey grandpa, you're a man!
It says a hair for a soup!

594
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,634
I have hair

595
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:15,143
Sorry, female only, tell your wife to come

596
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,108
I don't have a wife

597
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:17,671
Granny, why are you here?

598
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:18,576
To trade some soup

599
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,877
But granny, you've got to be in
the sex trade to join this queue

600
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,520
Go home, granny,
your hair is no good here

601
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:28,522
It's been taken so long...
Anyone working there?!

602
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,792
I came here soon as I get up
this morning and I still am in the queue

603
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,521
How much longer do I have to wait?

604
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,995
The soup smells good and it
makes my stomach grind...

605
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,272
Do you know her at all?

606
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:52,039
It's you!

607
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:54,210
She was here this morning for the soup!

608
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,384
Nutcase!

609
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:56,447
Excuse us

610
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,919
Thank you, any more soup tomorrow?

611
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:04,219
No more!...We've given out
more than 500 servings

612
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:08,892
Lucky I thickened the soup with
corn flour or we won't last

613
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,304
Sorry, we are done here

614
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,337
I'm not here for the soup

615
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,038
I am the person you're looking for

616
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,419
We found her! C'mon in!
Hey, is she the one?

617
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,852
Get up, she could be your wife!

618
00:41:33,023 --> 00:41:34,047
You know him?

619
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:35,487
Don't you?

620
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,092
Get up...

621
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:38,823
Do you know him?

622
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,691
Thank you for all you've done

623
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:47,833
I was only trying my luck
... but here you are!

624
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:56,310
How come you always go missing?

625
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:59,609
He does? Not you?

626
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:05,581
He has looked for me many times

627
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,651
But he can't recognize me

628
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,020
Every time, I send him back
to the psychiatric hospital

629
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,891
And soon, he manages to escape again

630
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:21,598
We've been doing this over and
over again for a few years already

631
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:49,188
Missy, keep stroking my hair.
it feels good

632
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:10,119
You can keep these biscuits

633
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,318
Don't mess around, okay?

634
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:13,456
Okay

635
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:17,892
Missy, keep stoking my hair.
it feels good

636
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,766
Perhaps you should trade your
handbag for my biscuits

637
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,437
You can't chew on your handbag

638
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,145
Forever!

639
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,248
Over there...Hello!

640
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:47,953
Forever Man.
,
I am back! I've got biscuits!

641
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:51,185
F. Man is for Forever Man.
W. Man is for Water Man

642
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:52,260
I graduated from HKU...

643
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:55,728
You are mocking Forever Man!
Where did he go?

644
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:58,663
F. Man is for Forever Man.
W. Man is for Water Man

645
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:02,269
Where are you hiding him? Say it!

646
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:04,063
I have a PHD degree
Spit it out!

647
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:05,241
I am a veterinarian

648
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,242
Thank you

649
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:25,726
The Department of Health
announced today...

650
00:44:25,963 --> 00:44:29,421
2 private hospital workers
are diagnosed with SARS

651
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,261
The number of infected medical
workers continues to rise everyday

652
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:36,530
Over 300 cases
have been reported so far

653
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:41,110
The sudden influx of patients is costing
enormous pressure on the medical staff

654
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:44,276
Its administration is seeking relief
from hiring temporary staff

655
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:45,311
... The first case of death
to public hospital medical staff......

656
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:49,679
...who contracted the disease
at work occurred today...

657
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:01,522
Doctor Mask?

658
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:02,964
Are you closed?

659
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:05,431
No, not at all...let me cook for you

660
00:45:05,569 --> 00:45:08,697
Gimme a few minutes...
what would you like?

661
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:10,134
I'm not hungry

662
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:14,574
I just want to release the stress

663
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:25,453
Your muscles are so tight

664
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:30,658
You sure are all stressed out...
Been staying up all night?

665
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,826
You should find some time
to see your family

666
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:40,000
Like those medics reported on TV...

667
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:44,004
They stood by the windows to
wave at their family downstairs

668
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,141
You should try that

669
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,450
Want me to press harder?

670
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,084
You okay?

671
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:05,994
What happened?

672
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,303
Zero infection

673
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,375
The Health Department announced
no newfound infection today

674
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:58,310
The accumulative total of the
infected remains at 1755

675
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,714
Hong Kong finally triumphs after 3 months
of struggling against the epidemic

676
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,852
WHO officially announced
the removal of

677
00:47:03,053 --> 00:47:06,955
Hong Kong from the list
of infected areas

678
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,164
Just when the SARS epidemic
is dying down

679
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,493
Another infected doctor at the ICU

680
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:21,899
passed away after being admitted
a week ago

681
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,665
Adding one more lament to Hong Kong...

682
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,037
The funeral of Doctor M.K.Chau
took place at the

683
00:47:29,246 --> 00:47:32,409
Hong Kong Funeral Home today

684
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:37,552
Nearly a thousand people
attended the ceremony...

685
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,351
The July 1st Demonstration
started at around 3pm

686
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,056
Demonstrators were led by several
elected democratic representatives

687
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:23,461
Giant slogans against the legislation of
the Code 23 were seen everywhere

688
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,640
Chief Executive accepted Security Secretary
Regina Yip's resignation today

689
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:35,502
Financial Secretary Antony Leung resigns
Effects immediately

690
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:40,206
What happened to
Hong Kong afterwards?

691
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,315
Now you see why
we should keep our memory?

692
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:48,748
But you know what
Hongkongers are gifted at?

693
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,323
They're gifted at forgetting

694
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:56,226
You don't need those pills, stupid

695
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:03,370
Back then after the SARS epidemic,
they invited some soccer players over

696
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:19,116
The 11 soccer players deserted
Hong Kong right after the match

697
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:22,781
But then we got 1.1 billions
of comrades hopping over

698
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,533
I can tell fortune too

699
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:35,638
I can see that you're going to
meet the love of your life

700
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,740
Her prediction is usually very accurate

701
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:39,704
Take my sister for example...

702
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,504
You've accounted all the way to October

703
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,341
What about the marriage prediction
from the temple?

704
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,415
Did it deliver or not?

705
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,311
It did

706
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:52,219
Right on the October first
the National Day

707
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,884
But then, I'd rather it didn't

708
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,892
Coming...

709
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,762
Hi, boss!

710
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:06,931
Cousin!

711
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:08,293
Cousin?

712
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:13,134
A cousin...how sappy!

713
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,179
The two of us were destined
to be nemeses

714
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:19,940
Cousin!

715
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,682
Cousin!

716
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:24,811
You've grown pretty

717
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:27,252
What brings you here all of a sudden?

718
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:29,189
I've just arrived from the mainland

719
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,326
Can I stay here for one night? No sex

720
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,789
No way!

721
00:50:35,399 --> 00:50:36,593
We're family...

722
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,601
Since when?

723
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,761
You've never acted like one
unless you need help!

724
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,334
Look, it's raining outside

725
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,033
Let me in and talk later

726
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,380
You must go when the rain stops

727
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,416
Nice place you've got here, cousin

728
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,883
Have you eaten yet?

729
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:05,324
Yes I have
I had some veggie dumplings

730
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:08,826
I can tell by the cabbage
stuck between your teeth

731
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,230
You should have told me early on!

732
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:15,463
It still there?

733
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:18,065
I've been looking for you for some time

734
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,370
Lucky me,
I spotted your webpage on the net

735
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:23,037
I came all the way just to see you

736
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:27,543
Why bother? You can get a room
in a motel or a hooker down the street

737
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,982
It's been 10 years already, cousin
... don't sulk anymore

738
00:51:32,489 --> 00:51:36,391
See my hand, I'm divorced

739
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:38,828
Come on

740
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,388
Should I congratulate you then?

741
00:51:42,732 --> 00:51:46,725
To tell the truth, I've been quite
happy since the divorce

742
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:50,400
So why are you here?

743
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,205
I have a business proposition

744
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:56,045
What kind of business?

745
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:01,345
Then I'd have to go all the way
back to 1980

746
00:52:01,518 --> 00:52:05,716
Granny, stop teasing me! 1980?

747
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:09,188
Don't think you can finish by evening...
perhaps I should go take a leak now

748
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:14,089
I'm afraid I might not remember
what to say when you return

749
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:17,256
But I really need to pee...
Just speak faster then

750
00:52:17,701 --> 00:52:20,261
That would take at least 45 minutes

751
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,472
Year 1980

752
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:27,441
Someone get the door!

753
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,740
Is it Quincy?
Yes it is!

754
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,343
C'mon in!

755
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,846
Come meet your Uncle

756
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:33,880
Uncle

757
00:52:34,351 --> 00:52:35,511
So here you are

758
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,013
Go put your stuff in Kum's room

759
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:40,750
Go on, it's just down there
behind the curtains

760
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,482
Don't touch my cards

761
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:46,325
Don't bother me, I'm studying!

762
00:52:48,198 --> 00:52:49,358
Anyone?

763
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,091
I am changing! Don't come in!

764
00:52:54,137 --> 00:52:55,001
Cousin

765
00:52:55,872 --> 00:52:57,305
Told you not to come in!

766
00:52:57,908 --> 00:53:00,342
Kum, I'm your cousin Quincy!

767
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,502
You see, we have two Mahjong games
and eight players talking out there

768
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,647
It's noisy as hell

769
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,817
Then I spot you through the curtain
and see you doing nothing

770
00:53:07,984 --> 00:53:09,383
So I come in for refuge

771
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:13,378
What are you doing?

772
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:18,484
Uncle told me that
I can use the upper bunk

773
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,829
Don't tell me you're living here!

774
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:24,427
I know, I might cause you inconvenience

775
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,728
But hey, blood is thicker than water

776
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,234
I depend on you to sacrifice just a little

777
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:31,306
Enough...
you talk as much as my teacher!

778
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:34,667
Cousin, you're quite an observer

779
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:38,439
I've earned exactly an education degree
and I was an honored student

780
00:53:38,949 --> 00:53:40,109
What a coincident!

781
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:42,148
I earn a living after classes and
I have the honor in school as...

782
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:43,717
Beauty

783
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:45,412
Beauty?

784
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:48,649
I don't think you really
know what Beauty means

785
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:52,251
I'll explain to you later

786
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:57,594
Your perfume stinks like shit today!

787
00:53:57,767 --> 00:53:58,756
You stink more!

788
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,597
Wanna order, jailbaits?

789
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,428
Bug off, ninja turtle!

790
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:05,740
Yo, let's get out of here!

791
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,969
But the fish-balls here are yummy!

792
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:12,439
Four orders of fish-balls
with long thick noodles

793
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,047
Long and thick, huh?
That will suit you just fine

794
00:54:15,518 --> 00:54:16,348
Asshole!

795
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:18,214
I was meant to pay you a compliment!

796
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:21,585
Hey! Four bowls of fish ball noodles!

797
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:22,849
I'm going to take a leak

798
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,595
Everyone says fish-balls
makes good money

799
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:29,128
Bull

800
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,027
Perhaps I should try
starting my own shop!

801
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:32,132
Cousin!

802
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:33,332
Cousin!

803
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,503
Cousin, you work here?

804
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,197
I am following your suit
joining the fish-ball trade

805
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,806
But this is a fish-ball stall.
not a Fish-Ball Parlor!

806
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:42,979
Is there a difference?

807
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:44,409
Are you done yet?

808
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,479
Take this...

809
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:48,116
Cousin, how about getting
me a job at your parlor?

810
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,842
They only hire young girls!

811
00:54:51,488 --> 00:54:54,082
Are you saying sexual discrimination
still exists in Hong Kong?!

812
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:55,656
You won't understand

813
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:57,418
Move over!

814
00:54:57,894 --> 00:54:59,521
Hey, watch where you're going!

815
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,393
You four-eyed chick

816
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,464
Your skirt's too short
to cover the acnes on your thighs -

817
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,190
you've scored an SD or what?

818
00:55:04,401 --> 00:55:06,028
It's you who score, Cyst-head!

819
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,067
I shouldn't have been polite with you

820
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:09,933
Four-eyed-big-boobs-ugly-bitch!

821
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,204
I think the both of you
owe her an apology!

822
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,806
I don't think so!

823
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,341
Then you think wrong!

824
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,179
And that reveals your lack of education...

825
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:18,746
... your lack of cultivation
lack of manners.

826
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,176
Lack of knowledge, lack of discipline...

827
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,816
Lack of parenting, lack of a home...

828
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:27,120
Hang in there

829
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,389
You're pretty tough

830
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:38,595
To a real man like me.
this is very minor pain

831
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:40,998
What doesn't kill me would
only make me stronger

832
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,803
You're such a cool guy

833
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:49,510
But don't stand up for me again
when I get bullied next time

834
00:55:49,746 --> 00:55:50,735
Those boys are brutal

835
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:56,011
No way! Blood is thicker than water

836
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,813
Love is...
Enough...

837
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:05,617
However.
if you're feeling a wee bit guilty

838
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,626
There's this one thing you can do...

839
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,466
Do what?

840
00:56:14,604 --> 00:56:15,593
Just guess

841
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:38,358
You are such a money-grubber!

842
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:41,821
Not exactly

843
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,558
I just want to start a business
of my own someday

844
00:56:52,976 --> 00:56:54,466
A chicken farm for you?

845
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,137
I passed by the market a few days ago

846
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:01,674
I notice that eggs are dirt cheap but
chickens are darn expensive

847
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,279
So I thought, what if I hatch
the chicks out of the eggs?

848
00:57:04,821 --> 00:57:09,952
I can raise them and make
a big profit selling them!

849
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,320
You are a genius!

850
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,563
All you need is this -
<Raising Chicken for Beginners>

851
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,095
Knowledge is fortune...
I'm a new immigrant,

852
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:18,357
but I don't need to be a hick my whole life

853
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,332
Career is the most important thing
for men

854
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,204
Depend on no one but your self!
That's where respect comes from

855
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:28,310
Cousin, I know you will make it!

856
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,807
Quincy works hard n' Quincy eats tart!

857
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:33,639
Cool! Do it again!

858
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:36,245
Quincy works hard n' Quincy eats tart!

859
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:37,646
How come I can't follow?

860
00:57:37,854 --> 00:57:39,344
I'll do it slow. follow me

861
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:43,253
Quincy-works-hard
and Quincy eats tart!

862
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:44,120
Again!

863
00:57:44,327 --> 00:57:51,699
Quincy works hard n' Quincy eats tart!

864
00:57:56,272 --> 00:58:00,470
Get out of bed!

865
00:58:00,677 --> 00:58:01,803
Let me sleep a bit more

866
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:06,642
No way! You have the college
entrance exam today!

867
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:10,978
Let me sleep... I'll fail it anyway

868
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:16,284
There is this saying,
You can only succeed if you try

869
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,324
You haven't even tired. how do
you know you're going to fail?

870
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,360
And without failures to learn from.
how can you ever succeed?

871
00:58:20,897 --> 00:58:21,659
What are you doing?

872
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,162
Helping you change!

873
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,630
Get me my glasses first

874
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,066
Here, take it

875
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:29,499
That's quick!

876
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:30,502
Get up!

877
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:31,696
I'm still very sleepy

878
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:32,637
Let's go!

879
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,809
I want to pee...

880
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,035
The toilet is that way, go!

881
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,577
Hurry up! It's almost time!

882
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,080
It's almost time! Run faster!

883
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:51,255
What's up, cousin?

884
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,251
I twisted my ankle

885
00:58:54,097 --> 00:58:56,224
Let's go home n' fix my foot...

886
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:57,366
No way!

887
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,434
Persist and you'll win!

888
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:00,694
I will carry you!

889
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:01,502
But I'm heavy

890
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,229
Come on!

891
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:14,976
What is it. cousin?

892
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,355
I hurt my back...

893
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,648
What are we going to do?

894
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:23,485
Don't worry about me!
Go take your exam!

895
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:25,490
I don't think I can make it...

896
00:59:25,662 --> 00:59:26,720
Okay...
Quick!

897
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,454
Just for you, I'll try to get
at least one point

898
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,720
Hurry!

899
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,830
Bye, cousin!

900
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,038
You didn't twisted your ankle, you liar!
See ya!

901
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,470
Keep going!

902
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,347
I did it!

903
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,522
What?

904
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,260
Cousin...

905
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,532
Cousin...

906
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:07,795
Cousin!

907
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,062
Did you watch the Phoenix?

908
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:14,267
Yep! Chow Yun-Fat
and Dodo Cheng are in it

909
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:16,274
They kissed for an entire minute!

910
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,812
They were drooling all the way!

911
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,539
Darn right! So much saliva!

912
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:21,684
Let's try it ourselves

913
01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:22,409
Okay...

914
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:24,109
One. two. three!

915
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,805
Wash your hands for dinner

916
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:22,473
And remember to rinse your mouth too

917
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,546
Stop watching, dinner is ready

918
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:47,660
Cousin

919
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:49,937
You can't sleep?

920
01:01:50,406 --> 01:01:51,703
What about you?

921
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,977
Why did my dad ask to speak
to you in private just now?

922
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,576
Uncle asked me to move out

923
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:03,511
It was only just one kiss!!
He doesn't need to do that

924
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:07,415
Nah... Uncle said I'd need to
pay rent if I continue to stay

925
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:09,649
Why is he being such an ass?

926
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,985
Don't worry, I'll help you pay

927
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:18,962
That's not necessary, I've been
planning to move out anyways

928
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:20,864
Why? Where are you moving to?

929
01:02:21,003 --> 01:02:24,803
This guy from my village gets me
a job in an electronic shop

930
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:26,805
I will stay at the attic with him

931
01:02:27,677 --> 01:02:29,201
You move. I move

932
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,410
I'll move to Tsim Sha Tsui
to be closer to my work

933
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,946
You've got a new job?

934
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:36,418
I've just turned legal at 18... getting old

935
01:02:36,953 --> 01:02:41,117
But now I can work full-time as a
nightclub hostess to make more money!

936
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:44,487
More money? Congratulation!
Thanks

937
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,626
Well then. remember to visit
me when your are free

938
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:51,767
Of course I will

939
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,026
Don't forget

940
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:54,134
Take care of yourself

941
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:56,134
You take care too
You take care

942
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,466
Take care
You take care

943
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,950
Take me to the Christmas Buffet...
Take me there by your Mercedes...

944
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:16,057
No more room!
But I'm so skinny

945
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:17,284
There's no room left, just go away!

946
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,618
I can sit on your lap

947
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:21,058
I can manage
Just go...

948
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:23,864
But I drank 2 bottles of
brandy as you told me to

949
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:25,157
Here is $200 for a buffet on your own

950
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:27,598
I even performed Kung-Fu
Just leave us alone

951
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,169
Kum, there's really no more seat

952
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,139
Go away! No seat for you
Bye!

953
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:36,973
But you've promised to take me if l
drank 2 bottles of brandy, you liars!

954
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:42,181
It's Christmas eve...and where
am I supposed to go now?

955
01:03:46,589 --> 01:03:52,994
Bastards, I really want to
go to a Christmas Buffet!

956
01:03:53,462 --> 01:03:56,226
I even entertained you
with Drunken-Fist!

957
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:57,729
You don't like it?...Impossible!

958
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,696
Let me show you again!

959
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,046
What the hell?

960
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:19,253
Cousin, this way!

961
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,354
Up here!

962
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:22,814
Cousin!

963
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:24,993
Come up!

964
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:27,927
Go up? How?

965
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:31,431
Watch me fly like Superman!

966
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:36,234
I'll leave as soon as I'm
done with the cleanup

967
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:38,373
Don't stay too late, okay?
Of course

968
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:46,077
Are you still drinking? Stop it, I can't
carry you if you are wasted

969
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,875
Then I will jump down

970
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:52,253
Stop talking silly!

971
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:54,116
Lighten up, it's Christmas eve!

972
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,724
See that? The lights are beautiful!

973
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:02,562
So what? I still don't get
to the Christmas Buffet

974
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,130
And I'm starving...

975
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:07,234
Forget about the buffet

976
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:12,338
I'll let you in on some good news
I earned my first bucket of gold!

977
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,373
Really?
Yes!

978
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:18,806
A friend and I sold some electronics
in China a while ago

979
01:05:18,981 --> 01:05:20,972
We made 80 grand!

980
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,015
Yeah? I make that in a month

981
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,082
I know you are good at what you do

982
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:31,726
And your job pays well!
I would do it too I could

983
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,694
But there're times when
I really want to quit

984
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:37,797
Why quit when the money is so good?

985
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,401
Make as much as you can
when you're young

986
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:47,474
You talk just like Madam A
so very old school

987
01:05:48,177 --> 01:05:51,271
People with insight all talk alike,
take Chairman Deng for example

988
01:05:51,981 --> 01:05:53,573
He had this saying:

989
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,879
It doesn't matter if you're a black
chicken or a white chicken

990
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,286
Make good money
and you're the good chicken

991
01:05:59,388 --> 01:06:04,382
I make good money, but I wasn't invited
to the Christmas Buffet... that's sad!

992
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,994
Stop whining about the Christmas Buffet

993
01:06:07,163 --> 01:06:10,326
Come here. take a look... see how
pretty it is across the harbor?

994
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:15,636
Look at all the skyscrapers,
all the big houses on the Peak

995
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,066
Hong Kong has everything!

996
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:22,035
How can a rich. successful
person not be happy here?

997
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:26,414
No...not me, I just want to
go back to be a teenager

998
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:30,073
I can go to school and also
work as a Fish-Ball Girl! That's fab!

999
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:34,046
Everyone shall always seek
to excel herself

1000
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:36,054
How much can you make as
a Fish-Ball Girl after school?

1001
01:06:36,258 --> 01:06:40,194
A club hostess makes a hell lot more!
That's true!

1002
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,624
Come, press this button

1003
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,561
Which one?
This one!

1004
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:46,894
I can't see it
Here!

1005
01:06:55,611 --> 01:07:01,072
It's so beautiful! Amazing!

1006
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,084
This project took me a fortnight to finish

1007
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,352
Think of it as my Christmas gift to you

1008
01:07:07,790 --> 01:07:11,749
But I didn't get you anything, cousin...

1009
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,193
Well... it's your thought
of giving that counts

1010
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:29,333
<Cousin, seeing this watch
is like seeing me - Kum>

1011
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:35,672
I'm pregnant

1012
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,244
What?!

1013
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:40,912
You idiot! I shouldn't be stepping
on your back if you're pregnant

1014
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:44,716
I was hoping you'd save me
the cost of an abortion

1015
01:08:44,887 --> 01:08:47,014
Get yourself together!
Who's the father?

1016
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:48,155
How would I know?

1017
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:52,886
Cousin! Cousin...

1018
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:56,321
Cousin! Here to see me?

1019
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:57,864
Is your shop going down?

1020
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:02,303
I'm just planning to cash in everything
here and start something big in China

1021
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:06,941
You leaving?
Yes. the sooner the better

1022
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,940
The Mainland is opening up now
and it has

1023
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:11,545
one billion potential customers there

1024
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:16,615
If you earn a dollar from each of them
you'll be set for life!

1025
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:20,617
Are you ever coming back here?

1026
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:24,054
Sure. if there's business to do

1027
01:09:25,728 --> 01:09:30,290
Hey mister, everything here
is in mint condition

1028
01:09:30,466 --> 01:09:32,263
Check it out, I'll give you a discount

1029
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,694
This Rolex is not bad. is it real?

1030
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,466
It sure is, I can offer you a good price
Let me have a look

1031
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,607
But I just gave it to you last month!

1032
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:45,007
See?! She can prove that
it's real since she bought it

1033
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,747
You two must be in this together

1034
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,142
Just make me an offer!

1035
01:09:52,821 --> 01:09:56,484
Cousin. don't be so sentimental

1036
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:59,127
It's only a watch, we can
always get another one

1037
01:09:59,628 --> 01:10:00,686
Are you okay?

1038
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:08,565
Cousin, are you okay?
... What's going on?

1039
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,370
Cousin, are you alright?

1040
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,875
This watch has sentimental value.
how can you sell it just like this?

1041
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,611
If you like this watch that much,
I can sell it back to you

1042
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:24,317
Fine!

1043
01:10:27,656 --> 01:10:30,181
Cousin, don't get mad

1044
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:35,596
All successful entrepreneurs cut
themselves off from their family

1045
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:41,159
People with big goals will not
be hindered by small things

1046
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,568
Don't you agree?

1047
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,868
What if you need money badly
in the future

1048
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:54,015
will you sell your wife and kids too?

1049
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:00,480
I won't sell my wife... but I might
consider selling the kid

1050
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:02,988
Even if you sell one, you can
always have another one

1051
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,154
Gotta get back to work

1052
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:12,596
Mister, everything must go,
all in mint condition!

1053
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:17,067
Have a look mister...

1054
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:26,881
Cousin... Kum!

1055
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:53,303
If you want a kid that much,
I can give you one

1056
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,268
Sounds good

1057
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:07,379
Genuine watches imported from Japan

1058
01:12:07,923 --> 01:12:10,483
Come check them out!
Cousin!

1059
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,118
Kum!

1060
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:19,828
My business partner was conspiring with
the local officials against me all along

1061
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:22,660
I was smart to leave before
they came after me

1062
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:25,405
Or else...I am in Jail by now

1063
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,239
Now that you've lost everything, you'll
have to start from scratches again

1064
01:12:29,578 --> 01:12:34,572
It's alright, I'm single
and I have no burden

1065
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:38,653
I would be in real trouble if
I do have wife and kids

1066
01:12:39,388 --> 01:12:41,481
Maybe your wife is willing to strive
against the hardship with you

1067
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,121
I don't want to drag others down with me

1068
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:49,864
And how come you're so careless?

1069
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,159
You won't be able to work for months!

1070
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:54,635
Do you know who the father is?

1071
01:12:58,173 --> 01:13:00,164
Just take it as
an immaculate Conception

1072
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:06,212
You've got to find yourself a rich
guy and hold him responsible

1073
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:10,815
Actually, I've found this American
Chinese named Richard

1074
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:12,215
He has his own business

1075
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:13,880
Is he loaded?

1076
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:17,986
That's great

1077
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:20,522
You can move over to the States
after the child is born

1078
01:13:21,697 --> 01:13:26,191
I'm not going with him:, he shall
take the kid, but I'm staying

1079
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:28,662
You sure you want to?

1080
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,833
It's up to you, the kid is yours anyway

1081
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:35,509
It's getting late... Check please!

1082
01:13:35,677 --> 01:13:38,805
Let me take care of the bill
Again?

1083
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:45,679
Wow, your purse is always full of
bills, just like a magic bag!

1084
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,754
My purse carries only small fortunes

1085
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,824
Your big fortune is up there!

1086
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,660
How much is it?
65.8

1087
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:58,698
Got change for this?
Sure

1088
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,830
Cousin. next time it's on me

1089
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,198
Cousin
Yeah?

1090
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:07,770
Gimme your hand

1091
01:14:10,379 --> 01:14:11,676
Come touch the baby

1092
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:19,880
I wish you'd become
a strong and smart kid

1093
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,715
And be nice to your mum, okay?

1094
01:14:25,127 --> 01:14:26,719
Say bye-bye

1095
01:14:27,930 --> 01:14:32,390
Bye-bye now, be good

1096
01:14:35,504 --> 01:14:38,234
Get some rest, you look tired

1097
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:39,407
Bye

1098
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:46,410
It's unfortunate today that you're poor

1099
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:55,147
But some day
your pocket will become full

1100
01:14:55,557 --> 01:14:59,550
Sooner or later, you'll have
more than you can lose

1101
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:19,144
Hey Boss!

1102
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,474
Happy New Year!

1103
01:15:20,682 --> 01:15:22,650
Happy New Year, boss!

1104
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:24,376
Sorry to keep you waiting, boss

1105
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:27,987
Here are our finest girls
the best snake handlers

1106
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,919
Got just the right snake for her to fiddle!

1107
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:36,630
I'll pick you up at the hotel lobby
tomorrow morning at 9

1108
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:38,830
Okay?
Okay

1109
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:41,697
See you tomorrow
Bye

1110
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:51,177
Cousin

1111
01:15:51,346 --> 01:15:52,438
Kum!

1112
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,306
Come stay out of the rain

1113
01:15:54,516 --> 01:15:56,780
Aren't you staying in the same
hotel as your friends?

1114
01:15:57,252 --> 01:16:00,517
They're staying at the Regent
I can't afford that

1115
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:05,583
When I gave you a massage just now,
I noticed you've put on quite some weight

1116
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,552
And you've become quite a masseuse

1117
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:13,423
You're looking good in a suit
You're looking great too

1118
01:16:14,603 --> 01:16:17,572
Found your 2nd bucket of gold yet?

1119
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:24,036
Fortune comes and goes...
I'm still the same old me

1120
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,340
But you guys are just talking about
your real-estate in Shanghai

1121
01:16:27,549 --> 01:16:29,141
You must be doing well

1122
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:32,818
I'm only the middle man
who earns commission

1123
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:35,784
Which hotel are you staying at?

1124
01:16:36,725 --> 01:16:38,215
Let's go to your place

1125
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:40,792
You sure no one will get jealous?

1126
01:16:41,229 --> 01:16:44,323
You spotted this right?
I got married last year

1127
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:50,635
Congratulations

1128
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:58,838
You see, everyone needs a bit of
connection doing business in China

1129
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:04,109
My wife's family is in the military which
gives me a lot of leeway in China

1130
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:05,616
I'll ride a taxi home myself

1131
01:17:05,821 --> 01:17:08,756
I thought we've agreed
to go to your place

1132
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:11,221
It's a rare coincidence, let's catch up

1133
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:15,295
I can stay to keep you company

1134
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,690
Who needs your company?

1135
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,298
I can save up on lodging as well

1136
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,569
No kidding?!
Free sex and accommodation?

1137
01:17:24,673 --> 01:17:26,800
C'mon, we are family

1138
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,601
Which makes ripping me
off an easy task?

1139
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,582
It's been over ten years...

1140
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,918
Quincy, you really haven't change a bit

1141
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:42,217
Cousin!

1142
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:50,564
No sex, only a nightcap... just for tonight...

1143
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,099
Cousin

1144
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:05,004
Cousin?

1145
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:08,110
Why are you here?

1146
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:11,285
I, Quincy Fung, has been doing just
one thing throughout my life

1147
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,384
That is. business

1148
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,119
I have a business proposition

1149
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:22,695
The only thing you've been doing is
to screw me over again and again!

1150
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:28,932
Don't be so bitter, lying and cheating is
in my nature I practically con everyone

1151
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:34,466
My dear cousin
all you need is to close this

1152
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,270
deal and you'll never have to work again

1153
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:42,410
Let's get married

1154
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:45,887
Okay

1155
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:47,581
I'm for real

1156
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,588
Didn't I said okay?

1157
01:18:49,991 --> 01:18:51,856
I'd need you I.D. number

1158
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:55,755
A169458(2)

1159
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:59,625
Good! And we'll register online
first thing tomorrow morning

1160
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:02,165
Shall I act excited?
Fine

1161
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:06,600
Gonna take a shower now.
see you in a bit

1162
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:23,215
Cousin

1163
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:27,417
Cousin

1164
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:35,132
Are you still in the bathroom?

1165
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:45,505
Think it's that easy to get married, silly?

1166
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:55,046
Go get ready for the customers!

1167
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:57,651
Singh?

1168
01:19:57,826 --> 01:19:59,555
Kum, are you really closing
down your brothel?

1169
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:02,426
I'm getting married, I quit?

1170
01:20:02,597 --> 01:20:04,792
So is it true or not?

1171
01:20:09,337 --> 01:20:10,804
Morning, Mr. and Mrs. Chan

1172
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:14,339
Kum. at last...
Congratulations, Boss!

1173
01:20:14,543 --> 01:20:17,535
You're so fortunate to be able to
get married at such an old age

1174
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:20,476
I hope you're not closing down
this diner as well, are you?

1175
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:21,944
What are you talking about?

1176
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:25,575
Kum, since you're quitting, why don't
you pass on your cliental to me

1177
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,288
Who told you I'm quitting?

1178
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,651
Your husband Quincy Fung!

1179
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:34,629
You're up?

1180
01:20:37,098 --> 01:20:40,192
Are you nuts? Starting this
gossip about a marriage?

1181
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:43,735
What do you mean by gossip?!
It is an announcement!

1182
01:20:43,905 --> 01:20:45,497
Didn't you give me your word last night?

1183
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:47,037
We consummated the marriage,
remember?

1184
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:50,773
Are you really for real?

1185
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,571
Of course. I'm for real!

1186
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,360
Kum!

1187
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:18,237
Why did you ask me to come up here?

1188
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,131
To freeze my ass?

1189
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:24,874
Remember this rooftop?

1190
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,542
No, I don't

1191
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:29,474
I do

1192
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:37,784
I also remember that you like fried crab,
roast duck, stinky tofu, fish balls...

1193
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:41,588
It's not like you to blow a fortune, cousin

1194
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:47,196
We are cousins...
I mean husband and wife

1195
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:51,864
Tonight the two of us
should wine and dine

1196
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:58,812
Be honest, Quincy
why did you come back?

1197
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,379
I'll leave now if you don't spit it out

1198
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,217
Marry me

1199
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:15,854
Nothing can be this perfect

1200
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:19,033
Yes, it can! Marry me

1201
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:21,762
What are you screwing me for this time?

1202
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,928
When did I ever screw you
over in the past 20 years?

1203
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,972
Pardon me!!!
I've never!

1204
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,507
You screwed me
over every time you're back

1205
01:22:29,911 --> 01:22:31,742
Gimme a break
Kum!

1206
01:22:32,480 --> 01:22:34,277
Just bear with me one last time, please

1207
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:38,676
Okay?

1208
01:22:44,092 --> 01:22:46,822
I left home at 19 and came
to live with your family

1209
01:22:48,363 --> 01:22:50,331
I made my 1st bucket of gold
on this rooftop

1210
01:22:51,766 --> 01:22:53,233
I've gone through numerous businesses

1211
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:56,570
Pirating, smuggling, you name it

1212
01:22:57,072 --> 01:22:59,438
I've made fortunes. I've hit rock bottoms

1213
01:23:01,309 --> 01:23:04,642
For business.
I was married and divorced

1214
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:11,949
During my prime, I was busy dining out
with all kinds of Chinese officials...

1215
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:14,889
When Chairmen Deng passed away

1216
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:17,991
I even got to attend his funeral
in the People's Hall

1217
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:26,299
In my darkest time, I spent 66 days
in the Qin Zheng Prison

1218
01:23:29,971 --> 01:23:34,374
Life is just a dream

1219
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:38,971
It's better off not to be sober

1220
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,143
Just marry me

1221
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:55,023
I promise, you'll have no more worries

1222
01:23:57,932 --> 01:24:02,869
What do you say?.. So it's a deal

1223
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:08,735
Done! Come on out!
...Thanks for coming

1224
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:10,377
Cousin.
Hong Kong is so convenient now

1225
01:24:10,545 --> 01:24:13,036
Marriage License officers even
make house call these days

1226
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:16,409
Can I borrow a pen...Where do I sign?

1227
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:17,846
Mr. Quincy Fung, Ms. Kum Yu

1228
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,884
According to the
Marriage Law of Hong Kong

1229
01:24:20,055 --> 01:24:21,989
marriage is an act of
voluntary Matrimony

1230
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,614
In the absence of a religious ceremony...

1231
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:30,425
... signing before me and other witnesses
will still bear you as man and wife

1232
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:46,376
What are you doing?
What the...?

1233
01:24:47,282 --> 01:24:49,079
Are you okay?
What's taking you so long?

1234
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:52,949
I'm thinking of a wedding banquet

1235
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,388
You don't want one?

1236
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:00,751
No... let's just talk about it tomorrow

1237
01:25:01,196 --> 01:25:03,562
Hurry up, I'm waiting...
Let's do it one more time!

1238
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:12,567
Right, 888021

1239
01:25:13,408 --> 01:25:16,502
Transfer confirmed?... Okay, thanks

1240
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:20,373
Why don't you sleep more?

1241
01:25:27,889 --> 01:25:30,289
It really doesn't matter whether
we throw a banquet or not

1242
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,855
There's something I want to tell you

1243
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:38,592
19 years ago...

1244
01:25:38,766 --> 01:25:42,862
Kum. let's talk that over later.
come sign this for me

1245
01:25:47,942 --> 01:25:50,934
What's this... in English?
Can't understand any of it

1246
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,774
Just sign it, I'm giving you some money

1247
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,882
You're acting weird, what is this?

1248
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,383
Just make sure you sign it the exact
same way you do on a cheque

1249
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:09,489
There... we are now officially divorced

1250
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:12,956
It's a marriage, not a divorce...
You've slept too much or what?

1251
01:26:14,969 --> 01:26:19,133
It's a divorce now that you've
just signed the paper

1252
01:26:21,075 --> 01:26:22,372
What is this?

1253
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:25,513
Divorce paper

1254
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:28,775
Why are we getting a divorce?

1255
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:30,917
What's this all about, Quincy?!

1256
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:33,918
What's going on?

1257
01:26:34,088 --> 01:26:35,077
I'll tell you later

1258
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:36,587
Tell what?

1259
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:38,386
That's quick

1260
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,255
It's for me...

1261
01:26:40,962 --> 01:26:45,592
Remember, we are already divorced
They shouldn't be able to bother you

1262
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:46,893
Who're they?

1263
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,002
Coming...
Who's that?

1264
01:26:51,339 --> 01:26:53,398
Mr. Quincy Fung?
This is he

1265
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:55,133
We're from
the White Collar Crime Bureau

1266
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:58,335
Please come with us in regards
to a case of commercial fraud

1267
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,740
Okay, just let me pack a little

1268
01:27:01,182 --> 01:27:04,276
What's going on, Quincy?
It's okay, they're mistaken

1269
01:27:04,452 --> 01:27:05,976
What fraud?
And this lady is...

1270
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:09,116
My ex-wife I'm here just to visit her

1271
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:10,689
What's happening Quincy?

1272
01:27:11,893 --> 01:27:12,757
It's done

1273
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:16,221
All settled, completely settled.

1274
01:27:16,531 --> 01:27:17,589
Go

1275
01:27:17,832 --> 01:27:19,663
I'll go with you

1276
01:27:19,801 --> 01:27:22,964
No... wait here
and prepare dinner for me

1277
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:24,769
Go

1278
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,705
Go back in. it's fine

1279
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:37,845
You sure you wanna sell all your gold?

1280
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:41,552
I want to get a good lawyer for cousin

1281
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:47,589
I've never seen you so depressed before

1282
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:51,959
Why don't you just pawn
your gold to me instead?

1283
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:55,695
No, thanks

1284
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,968
I want you to give Ms. Kum
a good price okay?

1285
01:28:02,243 --> 01:28:03,210
Okay

1286
01:28:10,551 --> 01:28:13,145
The prediction you've got in
the temple is darn accurate

1287
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,749
You really did get married once

1288
01:28:16,858 --> 01:28:20,191
Accurate my foot! The legal fee is
dragging me down to bankruptcy

1289
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:22,721
How much do you have in your account?

1290
01:28:23,531 --> 01:28:28,366
After cashing out...should be $3.80

1291
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,765
Stay cool,
money goes then money comes

1292
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,031
Request being processed

1293
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:34,138
Please wait...

1294
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:35,774
Balance HK$9,754,623.85

1295
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:42,275
1.2.3.4.5.6.7

1296
01:28:43,051 --> 01:28:46,248
How come you have
a seven-digit account?

1297
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:51,415
What the... you're rich!... You have
9 millions in your account!!!

1298
01:28:52,727 --> 01:28:53,659
What's going on?

1299
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:59,559
Okay

1300
01:29:17,785 --> 01:29:18,774
Kum!

1301
01:29:18,953 --> 01:29:20,250
Cousin!
Over here!

1302
01:29:22,590 --> 01:29:25,320
Sorry,
I... Gimme a couple of minutes okay?

1303
01:29:25,493 --> 01:29:26,425
No

1304
01:29:26,627 --> 01:29:29,095
Just couple of minutes okay?

1305
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,189
Hurry up
Thanks

1306
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:34,867
Who are these people?

1307
01:29:35,136 --> 01:29:36,933
Hong Kong cops and Mainland cops

1308
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:40,568
I have to leave for a while

1309
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:41,800
Where are you going?

1310
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:46,943
Don't worry, I've been cooperative,
they will let me back soon

1311
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,343
Have you got the money?

1312
01:29:51,386 --> 01:29:52,683
The 9 million...

1313
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:58,388
Lower your voice, keep it a secret

1314
01:29:58,559 --> 01:29:59,890
And keep it tight

1315
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:03,397
Did you steal the money?
Why did you do that?

1316
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,594
I deserve that money!

1317
01:30:09,036 --> 01:30:10,970
But I know I won't get off easily

1318
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:16,341
Why did you ask me to marry you?
So you can hide your money?

1319
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:21,040
That's one reason

1320
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,719
And the other?

1321
01:30:30,191 --> 01:30:31,590
The other?

1322
01:30:41,636 --> 01:30:43,627
Because...You're my only family

1323
01:30:58,352 --> 01:31:00,320
I'm not your only family

1324
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:03,623
You also have a son

1325
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:25,303
Remember the time
when I was pregnant...

1326
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,675
I was carrying your child

1327
01:31:55,543 --> 01:32:03,575
You always said that I lied to you...
But you are the biggest liar of all

1328
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,190
Let's go

1329
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:14,758
Cousin...

1330
01:32:17,131 --> 01:32:19,827
Listen, find our son!

1331
01:32:20,001 --> 01:32:21,059
He can keep you company
when I'm not around

1332
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,169
Cousin...

1333
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:27,539
Take this with you, just in case

1334
01:32:27,708 --> 01:32:29,073
You still have the Rolex?!

1335
01:32:29,343 --> 01:32:30,435
What's wrong with you guys?!!

1336
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:34,041
Sorry, just a second...

1337
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:37,382
Keep it and give it to our son as gift

1338
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:38,710
Cousin!

1339
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:40,854
Remember to look for our son!

1340
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:42,720
Tell him I love him!

1341
01:32:48,496 --> 01:32:50,225
I love you!

1342
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,730
Have you met your son afterwards?

1343
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:36,234
Yeah. I have...

1344
01:33:40,815 --> 01:33:45,377
... but not in 2003. let's not talk about it

1345
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:50,051
You see, having memory is a good thing

1346
01:33:51,392 --> 01:33:53,883
Otherwise
I wouldn't have that much to tell

1347
01:33:54,729 --> 01:34:00,429
I've overcome all the bad times.
how much worse can yours be?

1348
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,860
You know how to appreciate because
you've suffered

1349
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:09,368
Hong Kong history's just the same

1350
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:14,642
Fireworks started

1351
01:34:15,549 --> 01:34:16,982
Why are they having fireworks?

1352
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,515
Besides being dumped
you're also dumb

1353
01:34:23,824 --> 01:34:27,555
Today is the 50th anniversary
of Hong Kong's Handover

1354
01:34:28,029 --> 01:34:29,428
Oh yeah!

1355
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:12,932
I met my son later on

1356
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:14,396
Really?

1357
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:17,337
But I didn't tell him who I am

1358
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:20,205
He has his own life to live

1359
01:36:20,674 --> 01:36:25,202
But I ask someone...
to give him the watch

1360
01:36:28,349 --> 01:36:32,149
Are you cold, granny? Put on my scarf

1361
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:33,350
Thanks...

1362
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:34,613
You're welcome

1363
01:36:34,989 --> 01:36:36,388
It's windy here

1364
01:36:43,864 --> 01:36:45,889
My grandson should be grown by now

1365
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,167
You have a grandson too?

1366
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:51,100
I've decided get Lucy back

1367
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:52,904
Good

1368
01:36:53,073 --> 01:36:55,337
It doesn't matter how bad
she's gonna treat me

1369
01:36:55,509 --> 01:36:57,136
It's worth a memory, right?

1370
01:36:57,878 --> 01:37:01,177
Actually, before we broke up, we planned
to go to the premier of 2046 tonight

1371
01:37:01,348 --> 01:37:03,009
That movie is finally showing

1372
01:37:03,184 --> 01:37:05,675
It wasn't easy for the director
to finish the film

1373
01:37:09,290 --> 01:37:11,053
I think I remember now

1374
01:37:11,659 --> 01:37:16,119
Wonder if old folks like Tony Leung and
Faye Wong are attending the premiere?

1375
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,661
Can you get me their autographs?

1376
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:18,662
Okay

1377
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:23,535
By the way, granny, we've spent
the whole day together...

1378
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:25,261
... but I don't even know your name

1379
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:33,806
My last name is Ma, first name is...

1380
01:37:33,981 --> 01:37:35,005
Grand

1381
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:37,678
Grand Ma

1382
01:37:45,860 --> 01:37:47,885
What's wrong, Grand Ma?

1383
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,457
What did you say?

1384
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:51,756
What are you doing, Grand Ma?

1385
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:58,399
I'm really in a hurry, Grand Ma

1386
01:38:00,641 --> 01:38:03,667
I've really got to go,
please keep the scarf

1387
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:05,202
Bye, Grand Ma

1388
01:38:08,816 --> 01:38:09,612
Bye!

1389
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:13,409
Bye, Grand Ma!

1390
01:38:15,489 --> 01:38:17,616
How can there be such a coincidence?

1391
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:19,349
How can he happen to ask for my name...

1392
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,494
... and I happened to get
him to call me Grand-ma

1393
01:38:21,729 --> 01:38:26,189
If anyone knows about what happened,
they'd probably start calling me a genius!

1394
01:38:30,604 --> 01:38:32,629
And I've got the scarf too...

1395
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:36,571
Dear Hong Kong citizens

1396
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:38,404
Chief Executive Lau!

1397
01:38:39,046 --> 01:38:42,311
I know you are all ready to celebrate...

1398
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:46,942
...the 50th anniversary of the
Handover of Hong Kong

1399
01:38:47,121 --> 01:38:48,520
The success of Hong Kong
is not a miracle...

1400
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:50,919
... nor is it the result of my
personal achievement

1401
01:38:51,091 --> 01:38:53,992
It is the collective effort of
all Hong Kong people

1402
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:58,563
Because the kind. the honest. and the
down-to-earth are God permitted

1403
01:38:58,899 --> 01:39:04,633
The kind and the honest are
god-permitted How can anyone deny...

1404
01:39:04,838 --> 01:39:09,298
I still know your songs... wonder when
you will release an album again...

1405
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:17,783
Last night, US President Tom Cruise
called me to discuss...

1406
01:39:18,018 --> 01:39:22,045
... the re-establishment of the bond...

1407
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:26,123
... between Hong Kong Dollars
and US Dollars

1408
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:28,295
I've decided a new exchange rate...

1409
01:39:28,696 --> 01:39:32,462
... that is. 1HKD to 7.8USD

1410
01:39:33,133 --> 01:39:34,828
No wonder I love you forever

1411
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:37,128
You're a singer, but you've also
made yourself a governor

1412
01:39:37,338 --> 01:39:38,566
You are superb!

1413
01:39:39,039 --> 01:39:41,269
Also, the annual yield
of Mongkok Oil Field

1414
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:44,068
has become the 3rd highest in the world

1415
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:47,338
Unemployment rate has remained
zero for 5 years in a row

1416
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:51,349
There is unlimited wealth in our treasury

1417
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:55,545
That means, in the next 20 years,
everyone is exempted from taxation

1418
01:39:57,624 --> 01:40:01,424
No kidding? It's so touching!

1419
01:40:02,129 --> 01:40:04,120
Thank you! Andy!

1420
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:07,529
Above all, everyone is also
entitled to free education...

1421
01:40:07,701 --> 01:40:11,137
...housing, medical & elderly
benefits throughout your life

1422
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:16,470
In short, as long as you are a citizen
of Hong Kong, you are set for life

1423
01:40:18,145 --> 01:40:20,238
It's unbelievable

1424
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,775
I've been your Chief Executive for
8 consecutive terms already

1425
01:40:25,953 --> 01:40:29,480
I really, really, really, really... hope...

1426
01:40:29,623 --> 01:40:33,855
...that all citizens can elect the right
successor to my job for the next term

1427
01:40:34,161 --> 01:40:36,026
But before that...

1428
01:40:36,697 --> 01:40:39,165
... I want to present a present
for all of you

1429
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:42,367
Please close your eyes

1430
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:50,935
When you open your eyes again...

1431
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:55,038
You'll be able to see the Hong Kong
that is best remembered by you

1432
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:26,905
Live today,
it is where tomorrow's memory begins
