1
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:11,745
(bright music)

2
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,562
- [Michelle] Ironically,

3
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:29,797
they're not as big as
people think they are.

4
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:30,864
- [Man] Your boobs?

5
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:31,532
- [Michelle] Yeah.

6
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,366
- [Man] They're pretty big.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,767
- They're big-ish, but they're
not.

8
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:36,737
When I'm on the show, I do this.

9
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,507
So people get the real effect,
but really they're not.

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,441
That's what the joy is,

11
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:43,344
pushing them up, and making them
cartoony.

12
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,013
It's all about the cartoon
effect.

13
00:00:49,917 --> 00:00:51,619
- Well, a big trend in queens
these days

14
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:53,421
are those latex boobs.

15
00:00:53,454 --> 00:00:56,490
- Uh, I don't like the way they
look, those aren't breasts.

16
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:57,658
These are breasts.

17
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,826
- Oh, girl.

18
00:00:58,859 --> 00:00:59,660
- [Michelle] These are breasts.

19
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,095
- You don't have to tell me
twice.

20
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:03,797
(upbeat music)

21
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,003
- The reason I showcase my
breasts so much in my career

22
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,106
is because I love them.

23
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,743
As a teenager, my
breasts were nonexistent.

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,112
I was literally ribs, nipple.

25
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,115
I had a specific boyfriend

26
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:23,551
who used to play the bongos on
my chest,

27
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,553
and he did it in jest,

28
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,888
but I think somehow that stuck
with me.

29
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,825
And so my best friend and
I sent away for this cream

30
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,594
to make our chests grow

31
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:35,396
that we got from the back of a
magazine.

32
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:39,099
None of it worked, and
instead of embracing it,

33
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:42,870
it was always in the front of my
mind.

34
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:47,575
Weird that I couldn't have
security, but I just didn't.

35
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,680
I got my first set of
implants when I was 21.

36
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:56,617
I never felt complete
without them, so I did it.

37
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,786
I did it three times over.

38
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:02,790
So I got what I wanted, and
I had them for 16 years,

39
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:06,126
and all along, they were
making me sicker and sicker,

40
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,027
I believe.

41
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,964
I was sick for actual years.

42
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,833
Doctors kept saying it was in my
head.

43
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,202
Every single one says, you're
fine.

44
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:17,838
And then finally in 2018, I was
online,

45
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,209
and I saw that there
were tens of thousands.

46
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:22,510
I'm not even exaggerating.

47
00:02:22,543 --> 00:02:24,077
Tens of thousands of women out
there

48
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,481
with the exact same symptoms
that I had.

49
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:30,451
- Leg swelling, pain in the
joints.

50
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,953
- [Woman] I couldn't even
walk up a flight of stairs.

51
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,756
- [Woman] Chronic yeast
infections, sinus infections.

52
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,826
- [Woman] Brain fog, migraines.

53
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,662
- I got to a point where I
couldn't get out of bed anymore.

54
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,232
I was in that much pain.

55
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:46,967
- [Michelle] I started Googling
curing autoimmune disease,

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,605
and then the term breast
implant illness was on there.

57
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:58,612
And then I found the Facebook
group.

58
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,648
- [Reporter] Right now there's
an online group of women

59
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,115
who think their health issues

60
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:05,986
can be linked back to their
implants.

61
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:06,954
- [Michelle] And on there,

62
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:09,557
women that had explanted
right then and there

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,892
were telling me everything
changed.

64
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,994
They felt so much better.

65
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,866
- I woke up from that
surgery explant, and feeling,

66
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:20,568
taking that first full breath.

67
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,803
And you explant ladies know
what I'm talking about.

68
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,037
I took my first full breath,

69
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:28,776
and I no longer felt like I was
burning alive on the inside.

70
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:29,943
- [Michelle] I knew this was it.

71
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:31,111
I bought it from the beginning.

72
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,947
I was never skeptical, it was
it.

73
00:03:35,082 --> 00:03:40,053
So once I figured it out,
I wanted to tell everyone.

74
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:40,954
- I have implants.

75
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,557
I got my implants about two
years ago.

76
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,959
So when Michelle called to tell
me about,

77
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:48,296
she thinks she has breast
implant illness

78
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,564
I was really annoyed.

79
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:54,067
I had no idea there was even
risk.

80
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,804
A part of me wants to go back
to my surgeon, and be like,

81
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:59,973
why would you not say something?

82
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,208
But he'll probably deny it.

83
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,843
They don't even admit it

84
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:05,178
because they'll lose patients,
and they'll lose money.

85
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,881
(bright music)

86
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,784
- [Reporter] The FDA and medical
community

87
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:14,855
do not recognize breast implant
illness as a real condition.

88
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,890
- There have been many
large-scale scientific studies

89
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,991
that don't appear to show

90
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:20,628
that breast implant illness even
exists.

91
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:25,666
- Breast implant illness is
more of a psychosomatic ailment.

92
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:31,204
It's almost a fad.

93
00:04:31,238 --> 00:04:34,107
You know, it's totally
socially contagious.

94
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,744
The breast implant illness,
social media groups,

95
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:41,248
they're turning their patients
against their doctors.

96
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:46,286
They are way out of their lane,
and are doing a lot of harm.

97
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,062
- I just can't say that
this is a toxic biomaterial.

98
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,197
Does that look unsafe?

99
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,099
It looks absolutely safe to me.

100
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:02,803
It just enhances the
breast just that much.

101
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:16,249
- I've actually had 16 great
years with these boobs.

102
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:17,217
Are you gonna miss these?

103
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,085
They fed you.

104
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,653
- No.

105
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:20,888
- [Michelle] Really?

106
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:25,258
- No, I honestly got scared
that your career was gonna end

107
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:27,661
after you got your boobs
removed, I'm not even kidding.

108
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:28,662
- When I told you that
I was thinking about it?

109
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30,230
- [Lillie] Yeah, like,
I actually felt like,

110
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,432
no one was gonna like you
anymore.

111
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:32,633
- When did I tell you, like,
about two years ago, right?

112
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,834
- [Lillie] Yeah.

113
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,102
- I was talking, this is how
long ago I started thinking,

114
00:05:35,135 --> 00:05:37,871
I want to get them out because
I think there's a connection.

115
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,973
- I remember vividly telling
you, like, crying telling you,

116
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:40,974
I didn't want you to get them
out

117
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,042
'cause, like, you weren't
gonna have as job.

118
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:44,745
- No, you weren't crying,
how it went was this.

119
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,947
Well, there goes your career.

120
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,648
- Okay.

121
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,682
- [Michelle] That's how it went.

122
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,383
- [David] Wow.

123
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,317
- [Michelle] You really think?

124
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:50,884
- That's like your entire brand
is, like,

125
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:51,885
based off that, like.

126
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,389
- Yeah, but do you think
that I am just my boobs?

127
00:05:55,423 --> 00:05:57,024
- I never said that, I just said
you're-

128
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:57,691
- [Michelle] No, I'm asking you.

129
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,892
- No, I don't think you are,

130
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:00,127
but your, like, entire brand
is, like, about your boobs.

131
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,164
- Yeah, true, but my entire
brand is based off my talent.

132
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,199
- And your boobs, right?

133
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,770
- [David] That's like a
microphone drop.

134
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:10,438
- Thank you.

135
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:11,304
- [David] Thanks.

136
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:12,372
- Here's my question.

137
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:15,308
How do you know some of
your symptoms aren't just?

138
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,109
- I don't know.

139
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,411
- [Lillie] Like, created
mentally?

140
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:18,646
- [Michelle] I don't know.

141
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,949
- I just think it's important
not to jump to conclusions,

142
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:22,916
or you know what I mean?

143
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,319
There just has to be
significant amounts of.

144
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:28,756
- If you're sick enough, you
can jump to a conclusion,

145
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,691
and I'm sick of being sick.

146
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,225
And there's hundreds of
thousands of women out there

147
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,226
that are sick of being sick.

148
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,395
And the thing is, every
time I go to a doctor,

149
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:38,899
you're normal, your test
is normal, it's anxiety.

150
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,167
- What happens when you bring up
the idea

151
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,735
that you think it's the
implants?

152
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,803
- Dr. Allen said,

153
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,938
they tell us in medical
school that they're safe.

154
00:06:44,972 --> 00:06:46,006
- [Lillie] Do you regret getting
them?

155
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,942
- No, because I had a lot
of good years with them.

156
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:49,810
- Right.

157
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,778
- I don't regret it.

158
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,314
I just resent that I
wasn't told the truth.

159
00:06:55,783 --> 00:07:00,053
And the truth is these
can make you very sick.

160
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:01,321
- I don't know.

161
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:04,825
I think she's just, Lola says
she's faking it for attention.

162
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,726
- Lola?

163
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,030
Do you think I'd go through
surgery to fake for attention?

164
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:11,331
You think I need attention?

165
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,165
- A little.

166
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,302
- No, I think I don't, I get
enough.

167
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:17,738
Yeah, I get enough, plenty.

168
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:22,375
Not from you, but from everybody
else.

169
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,146
- Of course, I question it,
but I've always been supportive

170
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:28,348
'cause these illnesses
have been stretched over,

171
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,784
like, now decades, I think.

172
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:35,088
To have brain fog, Epstein-Barr
syndrome, sleep issues,

173
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,925
headaches, heart palpitations,
and stuff like that.

174
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,393
There was a lot of
symptoms, a lot of symptoms.

175
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:43,497
So I want her healthy
that's all that matters.

176
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:47,400
I don't care anymore, I
just want her healthy.

177
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,538
- [Michelle] I know it seems
crazy

178
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:52,439
that people are battling over
whether implants are safe

179
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,475
decades after they were
brought onto the market,

180
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,344
but it all started to make sense
for me

181
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,913
when I looked up the history of
implants,

182
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:03,283
and found out how this whole
thing began.

183
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,054
- [Interviewer] So how
did you guys find out

184
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,223
what your dad was famous for?

185
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,191
- [David] Kind of an interesting
story.

186
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,794
- Your fourth grade
story was a good story.

187
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:16,830
- So I was in fourth or fifth
grade,

188
00:08:17,965 --> 00:08:20,400
came home to dinner one night,

189
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:23,971
and the topic came up that
dad was gonna be on TV.

190
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,540
I was like, how cool is that,
right?

191
00:08:26,574 --> 00:08:29,509
And so I go to school the
next day, and tell my teacher.

192
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:33,213
Hey, my dad's gonna be
on TV, can we watch?

193
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:36,917
And she's like, "Well,
sure, that's great."

194
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,954
And so this opening shot
is the medical reporter

195
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:45,559
standing in front of, I think,
the OR doors, or something,

196
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:46,560
I vaguely remember,

197
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:50,363
and she's holding
silicone breast implants.

198
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,100
And the teacher was like,

199
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:57,404
"We're gonna turn it off
and let's go to recess."

200
00:08:57,437 --> 00:09:01,074
That was kind of my first
realization that that item was,

201
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,844
you know, his baby that he
created.

202
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:09,850
- He started in Canada.

203
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,552
He was a Canadian citizen,

204
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:15,455
and migrated here after medical
school

205
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:18,458
because he wanted to be a
capitalist.

206
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,228
He didn't feel like he had
that opportunity in Canada

207
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:24,031
because of the medical system
they had.

208
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:26,600
And that's what it's all about.

209
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:31,839
* Only in America can
a guy from anywhere *

210
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:37,310
* Go to sleep a pauper and
wake up a millionaire *

211
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:43,050
* Only in America can
a kid without a cent *

212
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:47,855
- Gerow and Cronin told me
they wanted to do something

213
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:52,325
that would be as big as
the artificial heart.

214
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,966
- Well, what we have done is
to replace the human heart

215
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,902
not only anatomically, but
functionally.

216
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:05,472
- As big as the NASA space
exploration.

217
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:09,509
- [Reporter] We have lift
off, we have lift off.

218
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:13,613
- They wanted to be
world-famous.

219
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,218
Gerow was a friend of mine,

220
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:22,990
and he had a bigger ego than
I do, this is saying a lot.

221
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,694
So in '62, Gerow is making
rounds

222
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:28,195
at one of the county hospitals

223
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,131
where he also did his charity
work.

224
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,001
All of us did charity
work, believe it or not.

225
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:37,337
And he made rounds and
he felt this IV bag.

226
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,606
- It just happened to be the
same day

227
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,376
they stopped putting
liquids in glass bottles,

228
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,080
and had begun to put
them into plastic bags.

229
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,515
So he's walking down the hall

230
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:51,418
with this bag of warm blood,
soft.

231
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:59,126
- It feels like a breast.

232
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,494
That's where the whole idea came
from.

233
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,596
- Now, at the same time,

234
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,233
there was a company called Dow
Corning,

235
00:11:06,266 --> 00:11:08,401
and they have a new product.

236
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:12,439
It's a material that can
be made into solid liquid,

237
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,743
or gel, or anything in between.

238
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:18,445
- [Narrator] This is Dow
Corning in Midland, Michigan,

239
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:22,315
the world's first and
largest silicone plant.

240
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,518
Silicones are a remarkable
recent development.

241
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:29,456
A great step forward in
the science of chemistry.

242
00:11:29,489 --> 00:11:34,261
Say, Dr. Miller, what kind
of silicone mixture is that?

243
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:35,996
- This, just hold on.

244
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:40,100
This is just a little
polydimethylsiloxane.

245
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:44,637
- [Narrator] Complex compounds
for making life simpler.

246
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:47,274
- Silicone was invented
around World War II,

247
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,377
and it became this really wonder
material.

248
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,244
Initially, it was used

249
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,081
for things like lubricating jet
engines.

250
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:56,616
After World War II,
manufacturers of silicone

251
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,452
started looking at more civilian
markets.

252
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:02,355
- So Cronin goes back to his
office and calls Dow Corning.

253
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:04,524
This is Dr. Thomas Cronin in
Houston.

254
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,226
And would you think about
making a breast implant

255
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,361
out of your new material?

256
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:09,296
The answer was yes.

257
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,765
- It was that simple.

258
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:15,435
- This was like the
Wright brothers airplane.

259
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,138
(bright music)

260
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:24,077
We weren't the first to
try to augment the breast

261
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,578
with an implant,

262
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,448
but every single case
of it before that time

263
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:31,418
had a lot of body reaction, all
negative.

264
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,186
- We saw some really odd
materials,

265
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,056
things that were at hand.

266
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,560
Things like woodchips, glass
balls, even kinds of yarn.

267
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:46,133
- [Dr. Patten] And then at the
end of World War II in Japan,

268
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:50,437
the Japanese ladies wanted
to have bigger breasts

269
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,606
so that they could marry
American GIs.

270
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,477
- There were barrels of
silicone on the harbor

271
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,414
in Yokohama Harbor during
the American occupation.

272
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,583
And barrels of it started
disappearing

273
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,220
because Japanese prostitutes
were actually injecting

274
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:10,858
some of the silicone
right into their breasts.

275
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,759
- And it was a gigantic disaster

276
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:18,098
because silicone caused
tremendous inflammatory changes,

277
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,334
and an activation of the immune
system,

278
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:25,672
such that the tissues were
destroyed.

279
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:35,448
Direct injection of silicone
was outlawed right away.

280
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,151
- So one of these new silicone
bags

281
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:40,120
could be the much better
solution,

282
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,390
or perhaps the next implant
revolution.

283
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,625
- Dow Corning, they sent us

284
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:49,362
a little tester about that big,

285
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:54,201
and we put it underneath
the skin of a dog.

286
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,572
Esmeralda was the dog,
and the dog survived,

287
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,843
and everything went well
so that was our research.

288
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:06,880
And with that we told them, yes,

289
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:10,717
we're ready to put an
implant into a patient.

290
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:19,159
(telephone ringing)

291
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:23,196
- Hello.

292
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,632
I'll tell you.

293
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:29,436
I'm being interviewed
right now, so I can't talk.

294
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:32,172
- [Woman] What are you
being interviewed for?

295
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,741
- Well, you know about my
breast?

296
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,843
- [Woman] Oh, okay.

297
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,946
- You forgot that?

298
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:39,846
Okay.

299
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:41,781
- [Woman] Bye.

300
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:42,682
- Bye-bye.

301
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,254
What did you ask me?

302
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,360
So my implants were put in long
about '62.

303
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,897
I guess the world would
be surprised to see

304
00:14:57,931 --> 00:15:00,533
here I am 88, and still going.

305
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:07,240
How it started because I'd
gotten some tattoos on my
breast.

306
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,610
I didn't stop at one,
I went one, two, three.

307
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,780
I regretted it 'cause my dad
preached,

308
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,549
never mark your body.

309
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,220
Well, having them a year or so,

310
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,656
I was just desperate to get them
off.

311
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,627
And that's how I come to
get to meet Dr. Gerow.

312
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,298
He was such a nice man.

313
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:33,600
He was handsome and tall.

314
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:37,837
See, I'd never seen any
professional person before.

315
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:43,310
I just had a crush on him,
secret one.

316
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:47,847
Dr. Gerow asked me,

317
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,451
would I like to have my breasts
implanted?

318
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:55,755
And I said, well, I don't know.

319
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,291
I said, but I'd rather have my
ears fixed

320
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,761
'cause I used to be called
big ears, and big foot

321
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,964
through the getting my breast
fixed.

322
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,433
Then they said, well,

323
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,602
they'd fix that too, and then I
did it

324
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,773
(quirky music)

325
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,856
I just felt real proud about it.

326
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:34,561
After I got out of the
hospital, and the first time I'd

327
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:40,800
been out on the street in
downtown Houston

328
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,639
I got a lot of cat-calls.

329
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:57,650
And I'd always thought
I was the ugly dumpling,

330
00:16:57,684 --> 00:17:00,787
but getting the breasts implant,

331
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,357
and beginning with the
doctors, and everything,

332
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:07,627
I'd just come out of all that,

333
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,431
and realized that I was
good as anybody else.

334
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,513
- No, okay, so you're
gonna have them removed.

335
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:30,583
Now what happens to
your emotional identity

336
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:31,918
once they're gone?

337
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,020
- The reason I got them
was for my self-confidence.

338
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,056
I needed them because of
male-dominated society telling
me,

339
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,859
and boyfriends that I wasn't
as attractive with no tits.

340
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,829
I always had a great ass,
but I never had tits.

341
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,797
- Right, because if you look at
the first

342
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,534
Seduction album cover,
you don't have them in.

343
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,401
Is that correct?

344
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:49,269
- No, I had nothing in.

345
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,937
- Yeah, because that's the album
cover

346
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,039
you are flat as a board.

347
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,408
- [Michelle] Flat as a board.

348
00:17:55,442 --> 00:17:56,609
Right after high school,

349
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:58,978
I was in a girl group called
Seduction,

350
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,482
and we had a huge song called
"Two To Make It Right."

351
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:04,851
So that album cover
followed me everywhere.

352
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,586
And I absolutely hated it

353
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,855
because it reinforced
all of my insecurities

354
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:11,691
every single time I looked at
it.

355
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,527
- And how soon after that
picture was taken, did you,

356
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:17,564
how many hours after that
picture was taken did you?

357
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,665
- Minutes.

358
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,635
Booked the next flight home
to Dr. Rosenberg, yeah.

359
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,871
So I did that really early on,

360
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:28,975
and it was my own identity,
thinking I wasn't worthy.

361
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,711
I'm not anti-plastic surgery.

362
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,447
If you love plastic surgery,
I love plastic surgery,

363
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:37,650
but it doesn't work right for
everybody.

364
00:18:37,684 --> 00:18:41,921
And for me, I think my implants
are causing my ill health.

365
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,923
When I got my first
set of breast implants,

366
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,793
I was told that breast
implants were 100% safe,

367
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,961
and that there were no dangers
at all,

368
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:49,962
but as it turns out,

369
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,965
that's what women have
been told since day one.

370
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:55,935
(reflective music)

371
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,480
- I met Dr. Gerow when
my girlfriend called me,

372
00:19:07,514 --> 00:19:10,683
and had an appointment
with him for liposuction.

373
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:15,655
And I was just going to be in
the room just to be a friend.

374
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:21,228
He was examining her sutures,

375
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:24,531
and her sutures were loosely
stitched

376
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:29,035
between the buttocks and her
thigh.

377
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,474
He surprisingly raised that area
up

378
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:39,078
where you can actually
look inside the cavity,

379
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,481
which took me by surprise.

380
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,652
It was like looking into
a chocolate Easter bunny.

381
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,055
When he raised her buttocks
up, he looked at me,

382
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:51,824
and went wah-ha-ha-ha, you know.

383
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,463
I really liked Dr. Gerow.

384
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:00,933
When we were about finished
with her appointment,

385
00:20:00,967 --> 00:20:03,770
her doctor appointment,
he looked at me and said,

386
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:06,473
I was wearing a violet sweater.

387
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:13,246
He said, "You don't look so
perfect in your sweater."

388
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,014
And I said, "Well, what
do you mean by that?"

389
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,983
And he explained that he was the
inventor

390
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,886
of the breast implant, and then
he said,

391
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,122
"Why don't you come see me
sometime?"

392
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:26,092
I was taking modeling classes,

393
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,828
and acting classes at the time.

394
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,829
And so I thought,

395
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:32,064
well, gee, I might
venture into this and see,

396
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:35,167
you know, it seemed so easy.

397
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:38,237
And I went to visit him on an
appointment.

398
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,740
I had a list of questions.

399
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,976
Are breast implants
decompressible?

400
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,846
Because I was taking scuba
classes.

401
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:50,983
And are they okay if you're
flying in an airplane?

402
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:55,187
I wanted to know the
integrity of an implant.

403
00:20:55,221 --> 00:20:57,256
And he said, "No, they're fine."

404
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:00,192
He really believed in his
product.

405
00:21:00,226 --> 00:21:04,564
So, therefore, I elected
to have the surgery done.

406
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,136
I mean, I was happy from the
beginning.

407
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,804
And then I realized

408
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,674
that something is wrong with
this implant.

409
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,577
It's flat, it doesn't match the
other one.

410
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,078
It lost its volume.

411
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:22,014
I went back to see him saying,

412
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,984
I think something is
wrong with this implant.

413
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,285
He said, "You have a rupture."

414
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,320
Now what do we do?

415
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:29,255
He said, "Well, I'm gonna
have to replace it."

416
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,423
I just said, "Okay, fine,"

417
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,859
but he said, "I'm gonna have
to replace both of them."

418
00:21:32,892 --> 00:21:34,961
So he increased the size.

419
00:21:40,867 --> 00:21:44,303
And I had a size C instead of a
B.

420
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:47,273
I didn't understand why he
wanted to make me larger.

421
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,941
- He liked big breasts.

422
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:52,244
And I think this was a personal
failing.

423
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,984
So he would have a patient on
the table,

424
00:21:58,017 --> 00:21:59,752
and install implants

425
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,257
that really looked like
this woman was stacked.

426
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,129
Nope, not good enough, take it
all down.

427
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,666
And another two hours
put in a bigger one, so,

428
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,202
it was never enough for him.

429
00:22:16,235 --> 00:22:17,870
- So I went home,

430
00:22:17,904 --> 00:22:20,740
but then later I had
another rupture again.

431
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,676
So he said, "Well, you're gonna
have to replace it again."

432
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,212
And then gradually I was getting
tired.

433
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:27,780
I was fatigued.

434
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,149
I started getting body aches.

435
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:35,187
Then I started breaking
out in skin rashes.

436
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:41,227
Gosh, my hair started
falling out in clumps.

437
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,195
I went back to see him, he said,

438
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:45,131
"Go see Dr. Bernard Patten.

439
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,899
He is a neurologist.

440
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:49,736
He's with Baylor College of
Medicine."

441
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,739
- Gerow found a number of people

442
00:22:52,772 --> 00:22:55,875
that he had done implants on

443
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:58,678
developing neurological
problems,

444
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,414
weakness, fatigue,
trouble seeing, thinking,

445
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:02,982
reading, writing, remembering,

446
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,051
chewing, swallowing,
talking, climbing stairs,

447
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,286
getting out of a chair, off the
toilet,

448
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,055
anything you can think of

449
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:13,192
that seemed to refer
to the nervous system,

450
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,327
Gerow would send the patient to
me.

451
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:20,232
So I began to see a group of
referred patients from Gerow,

452
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,071
and they all had implants 'cause
he was the implant doctor.

453
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:27,306
This was the implant mecca.

454
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:33,045
I began connecting the dots,
and seeing the obvious,

455
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:36,015
is that the implant

456
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:38,951
was somehow stimulating the
immune system

457
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:41,053
to make the patient sick.

458
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:43,656
- I'm not a doctor,

459
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,025
but it doesn't take a rocket
scientist now to go back,

460
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,160
and realize it was too soon

461
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:51,130
for Dr. Gerow's product
to be on the market.

462
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,065
These were making people sick
and ill,

463
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,068
and I need to do something about
it.

464
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,343
- Doctors told me,

465
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,280
you guys are really doing
women a disservice by,

466
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,350
because this isn't real and
made me feel really guilty.

467
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,384
- [Woman] I think we all look.

468
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,385
- [Woman] We all look normal.

469
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:14,220
- [Woman] 'Cause doctors
don't take us seriously.

470
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,489
- [Woman] It's an invisible
illness.

471
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:17,456
- I overheard a really
good friend of mine.

472
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:19,425
I heard her talking
quietly to someone else.

473
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,292
She's a nurse also.

474
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,495
Well, I think sometimes these
women

475
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:25,264
just want to attribute
their symptoms to something.

476
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,499
I don't really think that.

477
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,433
I mean, she didn't know I was
listening, but I heard her,

478
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,136
and it really hurt me 'cause she
has them,

479
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:31,203
and she has no issues,

480
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:33,139
but just because you don't
know something exists

481
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:34,373
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

482
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,975
- [Michelle] Did you confront
her?

483
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,545
- No, I didn't want to do
it in a room full of people.

484
00:24:38,578 --> 00:24:39,478
- [Michelle] She's also your
friend.

485
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:40,212
- [Woman] Right.

486
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,949
- Who here has explanted
already?

487
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:46,819
- I've gone to several
plastic surgeons asking,

488
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:51,023
and I've had two male
plastic surgeons tell me

489
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:52,158
you're not gonna be happy

490
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,225
with the way you look if you do
this.

491
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:54,961
- Yeah, that's the line
that they give everybody.

492
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:55,662
- [Woman] That's insane.

493
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:56,663
- And female doctors do it too.

494
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:58,464
- How do you know what
I'm gonna be happy with?

495
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,465
How dare you tell me.

496
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,166
- [Woman] At this point
it's not about looks.

497
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:00,867
- No, we're way past that point,

498
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,834
we're way past that point, yeah.

499
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,936
- [Michelle] It's not about
looks anymore.

500
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,237
- Part of the reason I was
seeking out

501
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:07,039
female plastic surgeons

502
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:09,108
was because I thought
they would understand.

503
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,342
- [Michelle] Oh, they have a
bunch of crazy ones out there.

504
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,443
I'm gonna use the word crazy.

505
00:25:11,477 --> 00:25:12,645
- They don't, they don't.

506
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:16,348
After I told her and I'm crying
and telling her all this,

507
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:18,017
all these things that I'm going
through,

508
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,185
and I'm tired of it.

509
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:20,853
And I'm so happy I'm gonna get
this out,

510
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:24,356
and I'm so happy she's
gonna do it, she says,

511
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,027
"So I guess you won't consider
putting another implant in?"

512
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:28,728
- [Michelle] Oh my God.

513
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:30,496
- [Woman] Having beautiful tits

514
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,331
are pretty pointless
if you're stuck in bed.

515
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,199
- Yeah.

516
00:25:33,232 --> 00:25:33,900
- I like that.

517
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:34,533
- [Michelle] That's a good line.

518
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:35,234
- [Woman] Not having sex.

519
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,468
- True because you're too tired.

520
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:40,106
- You're not parenting, you're
not doing, you're existing.

521
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,474
- [Woman] I haven't had sex this
year.

522
00:25:42,508 --> 00:25:44,977
- Oh, I'm not even gonna say
how long it's been for me.

523
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,079
I'll embarrass my husband.

524
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,115
- [Woman] Please don't record
that.

525
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,852
- [Michelle] They're troopers,
the ones that have stuck.

526
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,420
- [Woman] He needs some male
support,

527
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,322
another husband who's gone
through this.

528
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:58,357
- It's not easy on them, it
isn't.

529
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,092
- No, it's been rough for us.

530
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,260
- Of course.

531
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:05,364
- We got married three years
ago, and just the decline,

532
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,467
so I'm not the person that he
married.

533
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,870
When you go to a doctor,

534
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,005
and they want to give you
another pill,

535
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,442
they want basically just to
brush you off.

536
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,278
It's very isolating,

537
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:22,849
and it makes you feel like you
are crazy.

538
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,021
Sorry.

539
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,502
I just want if I can help one
person

540
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:48,440
to know that you're not
alone and you're not crazy.

541
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:50,176
And that this is something
that is happening

542
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:53,946
to hundreds and thousands
and maybe millions of women.

543
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,115
- It's wild that history is
repeating itself, though,

544
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,917
because so many women went
through this

545
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,220
in the '80s and '90s, and
now it's all happening again.

546
00:27:01,253 --> 00:27:02,588
And it's like, everyone has
amnesia,

547
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,456
but it's just wild that
there's these doctors

548
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,192
that aren't remembering what's
happened.

549
00:27:06,225 --> 00:27:09,395
And you'd think that they
would have been taught.

550
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:13,365
- I believe, in my opinion,
the first to get them out,

551
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,334
to have them explanted.

552
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,937
It was early '80s.

553
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,239
Dr. Patten said,

554
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:25,077
"You show the signs of silicone
exposure in your body."

555
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,614
He let me know that
there is a correlation,

556
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,483
and I really felt the need in my
mind

557
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:33,252
to really get these out.

558
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,987
That's when I went
through the Yellow Pages,

559
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:36,956
and searched for a surgeon

560
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:39,992
to get them out as soon as
possible.

561
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:45,164
I went to the appointment,
and I said, "I had a rupture."

562
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:47,299
And I said, "Get these out."

563
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,336
And I said, "When you take
them out, I'd like to have them

564
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,439
because I wanted to sue the
manufacturer

565
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:56,675
because they're making
faulty breast implants."

566
00:27:56,709 --> 00:28:00,079
You have to have data in
order to prove your case.

567
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,114
I wanted to know why I got sick.

568
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,416
Find out what was happening to
me.

569
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,185
Did this happen to another
woman?

570
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:08,254
But I never got my implants
back.

571
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:11,490
I don't know whatever happened
to them.

572
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,129
After the surgery, I
went to him, and said,

573
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:18,530
"I thought you were
gonna give to those to me

574
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:20,099
after the surgery."

575
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:24,236
And he said, "Well, it's
for your protection."

576
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,773
He said, "Let's get your sutures
out."

577
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,341
He avoided, and then he laughed
when he took out the suture,

578
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:32,044
he goes, "Well, have you
adjusted to your new shape?"

579
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:35,381
I was disfigured, and he
laughed.

580
00:28:35,414 --> 00:28:39,618
Like I did not think
that that was very nice

581
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:42,388
for a surgeon to laugh at a
woman,

582
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:46,458
and treat her that way in
that fashion, you know?

583
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,097
I don't want to cry 'cause
this has been a long time.

584
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:53,099
I have to get over it,

585
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:56,402
but, you know, it was, you know,
it was.

586
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:04,010
So I wanted to pursue a
products liability case.

587
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:09,415
I called different attorneys,
and I was laughed at.

588
00:29:09,448 --> 00:29:11,350
People said, "Oh, that's
ridiculous.

589
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:14,486
There's no such thing as
ruptured breast implants."

590
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,188
No one believed me.

591
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:19,425
- [Doctor] You see those areas?

592
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,093
- [Woman] Yes.

593
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,429
- Those areas show
microcalcifications.

594
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:26,065
I'd like to schedule a biopsy.

595
00:29:27,834 --> 00:29:29,568
- What if it's cancer?

596
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,471
- If anybody had told me in 1983

597
00:29:32,504 --> 00:29:35,141
that a diagnosis of breast
cancer

598
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,209
would give me a 30 year career,

599
00:29:37,243 --> 00:29:42,314
I would have been blown away,
but that's what happened.

600
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:45,284
(reflective music)

601
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,289
I was 43, I was diagnosed
with breast cancer,

602
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:52,324
had bilateral mastectomies,

603
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:55,361
and my first set of breast
implants.

604
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,129
- Mom.

605
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,565
- They ruptured.

606
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:00,532
- [Woman] This can't be normal.

607
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,734
- Actually, it does happen.

608
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,603
- Set number two, same thing
happens.

609
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,571
- Now what?

610
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,341
- Surgery again.

611
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,642
- Set number three, I'm starting
to think

612
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:13,145
that this is really not a very
good thing,

613
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,546
but what am I gonna do?

614
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,115
- Perhaps we shouldn't put new
ones in.

615
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:18,784
- I don't want to spend the
rest of my life looking,

616
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,087
and feeling like a freak.

617
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,826
- [Man] You're not gonna
look like a freak not to me.

618
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,696
- Set number four I said I am
done.

619
00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,298
And if it had happened to me,

620
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:34,533
then it had to have
happened to other women too.

621
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:37,369
So I started to look around to
find out

622
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:39,338
what the situation was.

623
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,775
- How can the FDA approve a
product with such serious risks?

624
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,477
- We haven't.

625
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:46,578
- Excuse me.

626
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,180
- When I found out that
they had never been approved

627
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:51,417
by the FDA I almost had a heart
attack.

628
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,386
(reflective music)

629
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:06,232
- The kinds of studies that
one should engage oneself,

630
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,333
we didn't do.

631
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:12,638
Nobody even thought about
a series of studies.

632
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,408
You have a new implant you
put it in, and it works.

633
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:19,378
And the patient is happy, and
then let's put in another one.

634
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:23,749
- So they were considered
an experimental device,

635
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,652
but when I went to buy them,
oh, these are fabulous.

636
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:30,389
People have been using them
since the '60s, oh, my my.

637
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,859
So everything was to make
me, put me on the defensive,

638
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:36,895
but don't put me on the
offensive
'cause when you do that,

639
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,400
you have lost your battle,
and that's what happened.

640
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,771
I did not find any other
information

641
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:47,706
about women having problems,

642
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,609
so I decided to write the
article.

643
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:56,248
Once that article
appeared, my world changed.

644
00:31:56,282 --> 00:31:57,683
I started getting letters from
women

645
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,718
who had read the article,

646
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,653
and they told me their
experiences.

647
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:04,523
They were much more horrendous
than mine.

648
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:08,660
And we decided to have an
information clearinghouse

649
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:13,599
because you couldn't get it
directly from the doctor.

650
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:17,769
And I put everybody's name
on a three by five card.

651
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:20,672
Write it down on a card,
put it in the little box.

652
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:21,907
It was endless.

653
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,779
We probably had somewhere
between 15,000 and 20,000 names.

654
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:30,749
And after that, the Connie
Chung show contacted me.

655
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:33,252
The lid blew off of my life.

656
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,956
- Most of us know little
about breast implants.

657
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,158
We've seen the ads.

658
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,360
We've heard the rumors about
which celebrities have them,

659
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:42,361
and which don't,

660
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,830
but we don't know anything
about the dangers.

661
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,366
- Connie Chung said,
"Would you allow a picture

662
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:50,869
of your failed implant to be
shown?"

663
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,405
And I said, "Yes, I would."

664
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:55,007
- [Connie] Sybil Goldrich
gave up on implants

665
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:59,478
after five operations left her
breasts mangled and infected.

666
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,013
She allowed us to use this photo

667
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:04,316
as a graphic example of her
ordeal.

668
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:07,286
- My daughters were so angry at
me.

669
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:11,290
They just thought I was putting
too much out in the open.

670
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:12,991
It's one thing for me to speak
about it,

671
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:16,928
but it's another thing to see
something.

672
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:20,699
And what I let them see
was pretty horrific.

673
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:22,934
- [Connie] Today she's demanding

674
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:26,305
that doctors warn women of
all the dangers they may face.

675
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:27,739
- Nobody has done the kind of
studies

676
00:33:27,773 --> 00:33:31,477
that are required for
this kind of product.

677
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,812
Just as I say that it's my
belief

678
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,315
that the implants are harmful,

679
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:39,851
the drug companies, and the
manufacturers

680
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,821
don't have any proof that it's
not.

681
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,458
Why should we be in
this catch-22 situation,

682
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,494
30 years after the fact?

683
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,832
- Every single woman went
to see her plastic surgeon

684
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,966
the next day,

685
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,937
and the doctors started calling
it Connie Chung disease.

686
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,740
- You know, this was in my
estimation,

687
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,343
frank yellow journalism.

688
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:05,277
It was just so dogmatic

689
00:34:05,311 --> 00:34:07,346
in terms of breast implants are
not safe.

690
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:10,616
And so then FDA Chairman,
Kessler,

691
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,418
had all of these hearings.

692
00:34:12,451 --> 00:34:14,653
- The implants hardened,
migrated,

693
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,022
generated one infection after
the other.

694
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:20,392
- I would give anything to be
restored

695
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,961
to the condition I was

696
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,864
before I had my breast implant
surgery.

697
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,568
- 25 years of study and
experience
have shown these devices

698
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,704
to be as safe as most things in
life.

699
00:34:32,738 --> 00:34:35,674
(reflective music)

700
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:43,415
- A journalist got hold
of these documents,

701
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,486
hundreds of pages of internal
documents.

702
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,787
He contacted me.

703
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:54,593
The documents were very
quotable, and very shocking.

704
00:34:56,195 --> 00:35:00,699
I ended up showing it
to the FDA commissioner.

705
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,735
- Dow knew that their product

706
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,838
stimulated the immune system in
1975.

707
00:35:08,207 --> 00:35:12,844
The FDA subpoenaed the company
documents that say that.

708
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:16,715
- In addition to that,

709
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:20,085
the documents had a lot of
internal memos

710
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,789
from salesmen at Dow Corning.

711
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,657
They were saying things like

712
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,427
I'm telling the plastic surgeons

713
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,196
that there are clinical trials

714
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,898
with my fingers crossed behind
my back,

715
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:33,932
or the implants

716
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:40,706
when I put them on the
doctor's desk to see them,

717
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:42,474
they're greasy.

718
00:35:42,508 --> 00:35:44,743
They're leaving a grease mark on
the desk.

719
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,545
And that makes a very bad
impression

720
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,947
'cause it looks like it's
leaking.

721
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,884
And then, of course, there's
the higher up at the company

722
00:35:52,918 --> 00:35:56,622
saying just keep washing your
implants,

723
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:59,858
so that they don't leave a
grease mark.

724
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:06,565
There was clear dishonesty
in many different directions.

725
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,072
- I am asking that physicians
cease using

726
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,475
silicone gel implants.

727
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:21,547
As physicians, our first
obligation is to do no harm.

728
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,883
(dramatic music)

729
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:28,186
- I'm angry, and frustrated, and
scared.

730
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:30,789
- They tell you it's in your
head.

731
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,058
You begin to think you're crazy.

732
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,726
It's very real.

733
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,127
- Walk in my shoes.

734
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,229
You want a study?

735
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:38,129
Study me.

736
00:36:39,298 --> 00:36:41,833
(indistinct)

737
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:45,136
- We have recalls for seat
belts.

738
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,805
We have recalls for cigarettes.

739
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:49,641
Where's our recall for
this defective product?

740
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,142
You should be ashamed of
yourself.

741
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:53,579
(applause)

742
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,552
- All these women were coming,

743
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:04,022
and wanting their breasts
taken out, and this,

744
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,892
and all these bad things
happening.

745
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,794
And for me, it didn't,

746
00:37:10,028 --> 00:37:13,765
and they've just been
a good thing, lasting,

747
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:20,272
but I don't know, so many
women were claiming this,

748
00:37:20,306 --> 00:37:21,873
and claiming that.

749
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:25,644
And I don't know whether
it was true or not.

750
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,782
- There was a bonanza medically.

751
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:32,318
And then the interesting thing
was

752
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,553
there was a bonanza legally

753
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:39,024
because a lot of these implants
turned out to be toxic.

754
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:42,661
- [Narrator] In the Old West
justice was hard to find.

755
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,663
Today when you've been hurt on
the job,

756
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,798
you need a lawyer ready to
handle

757
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,635
the challenges of a new
frontier.

758
00:37:50,336 --> 00:37:53,071
- Houston has a very high
concentration

759
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,240
of personal injury lawyers.

760
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,743
It was for many years a
blue-collar town,

761
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,845
and it was close to the port,

762
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:03,615
so you had all of these
blue-collar injuries.

763
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,183
- [Narrator] Working long
hours in the oilfield

764
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,852
is dangerous, hard work,

765
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:09,355
and it's a challenge just to
make it home safely everyday.

766
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:11,857
- The guys who are the most
successful plaintiff's lawyers

767
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,928
in the country, if not the
world, they're like sharks.

768
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:19,130
- [Narrator] When you have
an accident, or a job injury,

769
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,098
dial Law-1000.

770
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,869
- They're always trawling
for new business.

771
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,837
- If you've been hurt in any
accident,

772
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,073
you can talk to an attorney
who can settle most cases

773
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,875
without going to court.

774
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,743
- I think when someone heard,

775
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:34,346
hey, a couple of women are
getting sick with these things.

776
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,116
I'm sure someone like John
O'Quinn immediately thought,

777
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,619
oh, well, let's investigate.

778
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,362
- Make no mistake, we are
engaged in a holy war.

779
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:54,700
We're gonna win this fight.

780
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,768
We're gonna win it because we're
right.

781
00:38:56,802 --> 00:38:58,637
And we're gonna win it

782
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:02,007
because like no case I've ever
worked on,

783
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,876
this is the champion of all of
them.

784
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,112
(applause)

785
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:16,254
- You know, it was all money.

786
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,024
And in Houston, especially, at
that time,

787
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,826
that's what was valued.

788
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:23,729
So if the plastic surgeon
is getting wealthy,

789
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:26,264
and John O'Quinn was getting
wealthy,

790
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,299
it was like, hey, it works for
everybody.

791
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,235
And if there are these women
getting sick in the middle,

792
00:39:30,268 --> 00:39:32,137
well, somebody, you know, you
get help at the front end.

793
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,706
You get help at the back end.

794
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:43,682
- Okay, let me try that.

795
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,085
Hey guys, I'm posting this
to give you some news.

796
00:39:47,118 --> 00:39:51,222
This is the last time you're
going to see me with these.

797
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:52,758
I know they're a national
treasure,

798
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:55,894
but I believe for the past 20
years,

799
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,296
these breast implants
have been making me sick.

800
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,065
And I'm documenting this
journey,

801
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:01,433
and I'm sharing it with you,

802
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:03,702
so stay tuned for all the
details.

803
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:07,806
I love you, and I'll see
you on the lighter side.

804
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,407
Okay.

805
00:40:13,144 --> 00:40:14,079
Here we go.

806
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:21,820
My God, it's like I'm
nervous, I never get nervous.

807
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,996
Hey guys, I'm posting this
to give you some news.

808
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,166
This is the last time you're
going to see me with these.

809
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,735
I know they're a national
treasure,

810
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,404
but I believe for the past 20
years

811
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,139
these breast implants have been
making me-

812
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,174
- I follow Michelle Visage on
Instagram.

813
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,376
I felt that I really had to make
a comment

814
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,946
talking about my experiences.

815
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,220
I was fresh out of college.

816
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,957
And my first new job was
in a med corporation.

817
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,960
And they're a breast implant
manufacturer.

818
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,230
They hired me right away, and
we were doing experiments.

819
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,832
This was right kind of in the
middle

820
00:41:06,865 --> 00:41:08,433
of when Dow Chemical was being
sued.

821
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,968
There was a lot of lawsuits
going on

822
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,137
regarding breast implants.

823
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,108
- [Reporter] Once silicone
implants

824
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:19,377
were taken off the
market, saline implants,

825
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,213
which are basically silicone
bags filled with saltwater

826
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:24,983
were marketed as the new safe
alternative,

827
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:28,153
but even as the manufacturers
were making this claim,

828
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,088
no one had done the studies

829
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,825
to confirm whether or
not it was even true.

830
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:36,494
- People were saying, implants
are saline now they're safe,

831
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:39,230
but we were still worried about
the shell,

832
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:42,200
which was still made of
silicone.

833
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:45,436
To make the shells you have
this there's, like, a bar.

834
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,106
And then there's, like,
the shape of the implant.

835
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,508
And it gets dipped into
the liquid silicone,

836
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,277
and then it's cured.

837
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:57,115
And then you seal them up,
and you fill it with saline.

838
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,884
So we knew that there's still
silicone.

839
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:00,285
We're still putting silicone in
the body.

840
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:01,219
Even though the gel was gone,

841
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:04,122
there's still silicone in the
implants.

842
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:08,293
So we needed to test for
the safety of the shells.

843
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,064
I did these experiments where
I would take the implants,

844
00:42:13,098 --> 00:42:16,835
and set them on these silicone
disks.

845
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,969
It was, like, these round disks.

846
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:20,105
And you put the implant on top
of it.

847
00:42:20,138 --> 00:42:23,174
And what happens is because
there's silicone on silicone

848
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:27,045
if there's any leakage,
the silicone from the shell

849
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:29,915
will get absorbed into this
silicone disk.

850
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:32,618
And so everyday, twice a
day, I'd weigh these disks.

851
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,853
And if it starts getting more
weight

852
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,489
then you know that it's
leaching from the implants

853
00:42:38,523 --> 00:42:41,893
out into the body, potentially.

854
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:46,131
I weighed it for at least
six to eight months,

855
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:48,499
twice a day, five days a week.

856
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:51,002
And the weight would definitely
go up.

857
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:53,138
It's not saline that's coming
in.

858
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:54,472
It actually was silicone

859
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:57,609
because saline wouldn't
be absorbed into the disk.

860
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:59,177
It would just roll right off,

861
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,113
and could really start to even
see,

862
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:05,150
like, a glisten on the disk.

863
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:08,519
I mean, it was actually more
significant than we'd expected.

864
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:11,890
And I reported all my results.

865
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,025
And when reporting all
this data I'm thinking,

866
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:16,895
oh, so we're gonna, like,
change how this goes.

867
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:18,930
And it was really exciting.

868
00:43:18,964 --> 00:43:23,902
And just time goes by and
nothing, nothing changes.

869
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,671
You'd think that there
would be some kind of action

870
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:27,906
that would happen with the
company that they'd say,

871
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:32,944
okay, well, let's maybe pull
this off the market for now,

872
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,313
but nothing ever happened.

873
00:43:39,718 --> 00:43:42,220
I remember I took a tour of the
factory,

874
00:43:42,253 --> 00:43:45,156
which ran 24 hours a
day, seven days a week,

875
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,457
365 days a year.

876
00:43:47,425 --> 00:43:49,895
And it dumbfounded me to see

877
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:53,699
how many they were cranking
out they were still just,

878
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:56,467
they had just these machines
that were dipping those things,

879
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,670
dipping, dipping, dipping,
all day, all night.

880
00:43:58,704 --> 00:43:59,604
There was so much money.

881
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,406
There was so much money they
were making

882
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:03,174
with these implants,

883
00:44:04,075 --> 00:44:05,043
but we never did anything.

884
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:08,313
We never fixed anything,
never fixed anything.

885
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:11,249
The final tipping point for me,

886
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:15,286
there was a woman that
had an explant surgery.

887
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,990
She had to have her implants
removed.

888
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:21,626
They brought it back to the
office

889
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:25,363
so that we could look
at ways to improve it.

890
00:44:27,465 --> 00:44:29,467
I looked at that and I thought
of her.

891
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,670
I'd never thought of her
before, the her, you know?

892
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:36,274
Where these were going,
who was wearing them.

893
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:39,310
After a while, it started to
feel funny just working there

894
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:42,981
because they were
controlling the information.

895
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:47,085
They were controlling
what women could know.

896
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:50,221
I felt like I was a part
of something sinister.

897
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,257
I made my exit from the
breast implant industry,

898
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:54,159
and never looked back.

899
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:56,962
- [Michelle] Okay.

900
00:44:56,995 --> 00:45:00,165
Packing my bag to go
down to Newport Beach.

901
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:04,469
Of course, I have to have
a candle because you know.

902
00:45:04,502 --> 00:45:09,040
Water bottles, and then
sweat pants, button-up stuff,

903
00:45:10,241 --> 00:45:11,509
all these things,

904
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,211
and, guys, look, no
nails 'cause the surgery.

905
00:45:13,244 --> 00:45:16,081
Ew, whose hands are these?

906
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:19,117
I'm so natural I could puke.

907
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,186
I'm shopping for bras.

908
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:25,156
I think I got the right
size right here, right?

909
00:45:26,191 --> 00:45:28,726
Think I'm in the right section.

910
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,096
Here we go, that'll be me.

911
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:41,339
So my surgery is in two and a
half hours.

912
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:44,175
- [Lillie] I'm proud of you.

913
00:45:44,209 --> 00:45:48,113
- Well, a prayer at noon would
be lovely.

914
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,414
- [Lillie] Okay.

915
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:53,651
- [Michelle] My atheist child.

916
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:58,023
- [David] Lillie, say
something nice to your mama.

917
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:01,392
- [Lillie] I love you,
and it's gonna be great.

918
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,694
- [Michelle] I love you too.

919
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,165
- [Lillie] Where the fuck are
your nails?

920
00:46:07,198 --> 00:46:09,400
(laughing)

921
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,138
- [Michelle] When silicone
implants were banned,

922
00:46:13,171 --> 00:46:16,641
I was working at a strip club
in Queens called Goldfingers.

923
00:46:16,674 --> 00:46:18,509
I hosted the hot oil wrestling
show

924
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:21,212
because my breasts were too
small to get a job as a dancer.

925
00:46:21,246 --> 00:46:25,450
My little kind of large B
cups weren't gonna do it.

926
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,386
The girls that made the money,

927
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:30,588
they were called featured
dancers, right?

928
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,425
They were huge, and they
were still getting implants.

929
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,527
Many of them were actually
going all the way to Houston

930
00:46:36,561 --> 00:46:38,429
to get them because Houston

931
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,565
not only was the most
affordable place to get them,

932
00:46:40,598 --> 00:46:42,800
they also went the biggest.

933
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:49,841
- After the FDA moratorium,

934
00:46:49,875 --> 00:46:51,877
there was definitely a chill on
implants.

935
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:54,212
I mean, you literally couldn't
get silicone implants.

936
00:46:54,245 --> 00:46:56,114
You could only get saline
implants.

937
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:57,582
So during the moratorium,

938
00:46:57,615 --> 00:47:00,518
some of the largest
customers of breast implants

939
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:02,888
were women in the burlesque
industry,

940
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:04,589
and the cabaret industry.

941
00:47:04,622 --> 00:47:07,425
Houston was ground zero for
that.

942
00:47:14,365 --> 00:47:18,904
- The demand in the market
for topless dance clubs,

943
00:47:18,937 --> 00:47:22,473
obviously, for breasts is
higher because, you know,

944
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:25,776
to put a slang phrase, it's a
titty bar.

945
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,750
- One of the marketing tactics
was that I would go out to,

946
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:36,922
there's probably not a
gentlemen's
club in Harris, Brazoria,

947
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:42,160
or Galveston County that I
have not personally frequented.

948
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:46,531
I used to always say
that I was out, you know,

949
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,669
selling boobs for Dr. Johnson.

950
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,870
He would always say,

951
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:57,675
"You're gonna go strum us up
some business this weekend."

952
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:00,912
I would actually go
into the dressing rooms.

953
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:03,348
And I had a way with the girls.

954
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,650
I would talk to them about a way

955
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:08,553
that we could make you
feel better about yourself,

956
00:48:08,586 --> 00:48:13,424
improve your income, your
health, what's good for you.

957
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,627
- It was like, well, okay, you
have the silicone implants,

958
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,730
but we have now these saline
implants,

959
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:22,267
which are healthier,
and look more natural.

960
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:26,604
So I think, again, it's all
about the money, ultimately.

961
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,273
- I gave 500 business cards out

962
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,708
probably in just a few months.

963
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:34,312
He started Grand Teton Days.

964
00:48:34,345 --> 00:48:37,548
It was a discounted
rate if you booked then.

965
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:41,752
Our day on a Teton Day was
just go, go, go, go, go.

966
00:48:43,321 --> 00:48:44,289
The ladies would come in,

967
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,291
and we'd have a whole
waiting room out there,

968
00:48:46,324 --> 00:48:49,594
and, golly, sometimes I'd
tell them, I'd say let's say,

969
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:50,795
be knocking on the door, let's
go.

970
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:51,796
- Come on, let's go because.
- Let's go.

971
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:56,434
- I knew Gerald quite
well, and I like Gerald,

972
00:48:56,467 --> 00:49:01,339
although, he was even more
eccentric than was Frank Gerow.

973
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,011
- Every surgical day, radio on,

974
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:07,778
it have to be the country music.

975
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,647
- Oh yeah, uh-hmm.

976
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,581
- Willie Nelson.

977
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:11,882
- [Darlene] Yes, indeed.

978
00:49:11,916 --> 00:49:13,851
- [Nurse] Linda, come on back,
Linda.

979
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:18,856
* If you've got the money
honey I've got the time *

980
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,058
We'll go honky tonkin'

981
00:49:20,091 --> 00:49:22,960
- Get one on the table, get
them under, get them going.

982
00:49:22,994 --> 00:49:24,129
Move them to recovery.

983
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:27,765
She's recovering while we're
getting another one going.

984
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,500
- There was a conveyor belt of
women

985
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:32,870
just coming through these
operation rooms.

986
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,505
- He would line up 20 patients,

987
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,608
and do 20 breast augmentations
all day.

988
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,511
- It's like boobs everywhere,
you know what I mean?

989
00:49:40,545 --> 00:49:44,049
And this crazy doctor
in this Hawaiian shirt,

990
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:46,917
white cowboy boots, are
you for real right now?

991
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:51,956
* If you've got the money
honey I've got the time *

992
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:58,463
- He had a swimming pool,
it was like a breast.

993
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,830
It was a breast.

994
00:49:59,864 --> 00:50:01,699
- And the nipple was the hot
tub.

995
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:02,600
- Yeah.

996
00:50:07,405 --> 00:50:08,639
- Anna Nicole, she got
a lot of recognition,

997
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:13,411
and women got more comfortable
talking about breast implants

998
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,880
because of her publicity.

999
00:50:15,913 --> 00:50:17,582
- Her career started right over
here

1000
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:20,618
at a club called Rick's Cabaret.

1001
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:21,952
- It was sort of a combination

1002
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:23,954
of an old-fashioned titty bar,

1003
00:50:23,988 --> 00:50:27,792
and, like, an upper-class
British men's club.

1004
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,530
So you could have your
cigars and your brandy,

1005
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,965
and an 18-year-old SMU student

1006
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,703
working her way through college.

1007
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:39,637
- [Reporter] Strip clubs,

1008
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,639
once found only on the seedy
side of town

1009
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:44,709
have today become business
centers.

1010
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:48,045
- Rick's was the first
publicly traded cabaret company

1011
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:49,180
in the world.

1012
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:51,949
It was American Express's
largest corporate account.

1013
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,919
It really popularized large
breasts

1014
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,489
for this mainstream market.

1015
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:00,525
And in fact, from Rick's
Cabaret,

1016
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:04,061
you had this idea of large
breasts migrating to Hollywood.

1017
00:51:04,095 --> 00:51:06,997
And from there the rest of the
world.

1018
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:10,535
- Okay, I was straight as a
board when I was growing up.

1019
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:14,572
I was flat-chested,
nothing compared to this.

1020
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:18,809
- [Regis] There isn't much
compared to that, ha-ha.

1021
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:23,114
- Anna Nicole, anytime she
would be in the spotlight,

1022
00:51:23,148 --> 00:51:26,517
it made a lot of young
girls feel comfortable

1023
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:27,952
about talking about breast
implants,

1024
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:30,054
and to actually get
out there and get them.

1025
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,021
- [Woman] Thank you.

1026
00:51:31,055 --> 00:51:32,457
- [Woman] Can I have
your tits by any chance?

1027
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:33,858
- [Man] No, no tits allowed.

1028
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:36,661
- I'll give you my doctor's
name.

1029
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:39,130
(upbeat music)

1030
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:49,039
- Dr. Johnson, a lot of ladies
came to him

1031
00:51:49,073 --> 00:51:52,510
to be very, very, very large
sized.

1032
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:56,013
And he's like, "What
can we do to do that?"

1033
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,653
The largest implant that
you can buy is a euro sell,

1034
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,955
it's overseas and from France.

1035
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,425
And I believe that one goes only
up to,

1036
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,161
like, three or 4,000 cc's,
but don't quote me on that,

1037
00:52:10,195 --> 00:52:12,863
but once you get to a certain
point with the big implants,

1038
00:52:12,897 --> 00:52:17,702
it voids the manufacturer
warranty for the implants.

1039
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:19,870
What you're looking at here is

1040
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:22,473
you're looking at polypropylene
string.

1041
00:52:22,507 --> 00:52:26,211
Now he put this string in
some of the largest ladies

1042
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:28,112
that we have ever done.

1043
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,449
The polypropylene string is just
that.

1044
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:36,086
It was just like a big wad of
string, just wad of string.

1045
00:52:41,192 --> 00:52:44,529
I mean, he had an FDA experiment
approval, a patent on that,

1046
00:52:44,562 --> 00:52:46,964
and they had to sign a release.

1047
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:47,998
- [Alma] So they have to sign.

1048
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:49,934
- He would make a pocket,

1049
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:53,170
usually a little under
the inframammary crease,

1050
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:55,072
and put the string in.

1051
00:52:56,241 --> 00:52:57,174
What would happen is

1052
00:52:57,208 --> 00:53:01,011
the string is a foreign
body to the breast,

1053
00:53:01,045 --> 00:53:03,948
so the breasts would start to
react to this foreign body,

1054
00:53:03,981 --> 00:53:06,717
and have, like, almost
an allergic reaction,

1055
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,486
or some type of reaction.

1056
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,821
So it caused the serum
to just build and build,

1057
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:12,623
and build and build and build.

1058
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:14,259
What happened is we had to teach
patients

1059
00:53:14,292 --> 00:53:18,863
to take an 18 gauge
needle, and a 60cc syringe,

1060
00:53:18,896 --> 00:53:19,797
embed it on the breast,

1061
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:23,668
and actually withdraw some of
the serum.

1062
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:27,972
So if I didn't, like,
reduce with the syringe,

1063
00:53:28,005 --> 00:53:29,039
and the needle,

1064
00:53:29,073 --> 00:53:32,943
they would just get huge,
huge, huge, huge, huge.

1065
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,147
Dr. Johnson, he's thinking,
okay, at some point

1066
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:38,616
the body would stop,

1067
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:42,620
and it would accommodate
this string implant,

1068
00:53:42,653 --> 00:53:45,523
and would stop making the
serum that didn't happen.

1069
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:47,157
The breast tissue itself
would be compromised,

1070
00:53:47,191 --> 00:53:48,793
and the polypropylene

1071
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:51,228
would start rubbing the
side of the breast wall.

1072
00:53:51,262 --> 00:53:54,999
And it could actually start
to evacuate out of the body.

1073
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:58,035
He got more aggressive
with encouraging the ladies

1074
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,305
to go ahead and get these out.

1075
00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:02,172
- I'm a ticking time bomb

1076
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:05,209
because anything could happen to
me.

1077
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:10,047
I was basically a victim of an
experiment.

1078
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,817
I have one option, a mastectomy.

1079
00:54:15,686 --> 00:54:17,588
- If PPP would have worked,

1080
00:54:17,622 --> 00:54:20,157
wow, what an amazing thing
that would have been.

1081
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,926
If it would have worked.

1082
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:22,960
- [Alma] If.

1083
00:54:24,929 --> 00:54:27,598
(quirky music)

1084
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:46,116
- With your implants being
older,

1085
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,754
it wouldn't surprise me if at
least one of them is ruptured.

1086
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:50,955
- Right.

1087
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,990
- So you have your implants
surrounded by the scar sac.

1088
00:54:53,023 --> 00:54:55,726
The whole thing comes out in
one piece without any tear

1089
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,662
in case there's a rupture,

1090
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:59,263
because if you make a tear,

1091
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:02,099
now some of that free
silicone gel will come out.

1092
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,702
- [Michelle] For how long
have you only been explanting?

1093
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,103
- [Dr. Chun] Probably about two
years.

1094
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,672
- 'Cause you were doing
other stuff up until then,

1095
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:08,373
and then it became.

1096
00:55:08,406 --> 00:55:09,206
- [Dr. Chun] Exactly.

1097
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:09,874
- The primary.

1098
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,009
- Yeah, 'cause the thing is

1099
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,879
the more I would do this type of
surgery

1100
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:16,714
as that volume went up,

1101
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:19,750
and you start consistently
getting that same feedback.

1102
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:21,686
Oh, my God, my life has changed.

1103
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:26,090
I'm no longer bedridden
unable to do anything.

1104
00:55:26,123 --> 00:55:28,993
Now I'm out there my old self
again.

1105
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,361
There have been some patients

1106
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:33,263
where they're just a
completely different person.

1107
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,365
- Right.

1108
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,165
- [Dr. Chun] And that's
their old self coming back.

1109
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:36,266
- Why do some doctors not
believe

1110
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:40,304
that breast implant illness
is real do you think?

1111
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:42,840
- Well, I mean, I think the
biggest thing is, you know,

1112
00:55:42,873 --> 00:55:46,944
as doctors we're trained
to be like scientists,

1113
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:52,016
so we're supposed to use data
to formulate our opinions.

1114
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:55,352
Then everyone points to
the core clinical studies

1115
00:55:55,386 --> 00:55:56,220
that were done.

1116
00:55:56,253 --> 00:55:59,857
And what we were told all these
years

1117
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,794
was that studies have shown
referring to those two studies,

1118
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:05,430
that there is no connection

1119
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:08,365
between the implants and these
symptoms.

1120
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:12,302
So that's the story that gets
told over and over and over.

1121
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:13,838
And so everyone's mindset is,

1122
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:16,273
okay, well, you can't
be sick from implants

1123
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:18,876
because I've been told
that the study showed

1124
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,377
that does not happen.

1125
00:56:20,411 --> 00:56:23,213
(dramatic music)

1126
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:28,953
- In "Medicine Tonight"

1127
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:32,156
in 1992 the FDA banned
silicone gel breast implants

1128
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:34,258
for all, but a limited number of
women,

1129
00:56:34,291 --> 00:56:36,694
not because of known risks,

1130
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:38,763
but because of possible risks.

1131
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,832
Now four years later, many
are asking, was it real,

1132
00:56:41,866 --> 00:56:44,068
or was it a silicone scare?

1133
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:48,172
- [Reporter] Recent
studies say there's no link

1134
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:50,941
between silicone gel implants
and disease,

1135
00:56:50,975 --> 00:56:53,343
studies at the Mayo Clinic and
Harvard,

1136
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:56,313
published in the prestigious
"New England Journal."

1137
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:58,949
Some believe it's time
to take a second look.

1138
00:56:58,983 --> 00:57:02,386
- I look at it as the hoax of
the century.

1139
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:09,393
- What happened was Dow
Corning had to do something.

1140
00:57:09,426 --> 00:57:12,362
They were gonna lose a lot of
money.

1141
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,032
Number one, they had the
most popular breast implants

1142
00:57:15,065 --> 00:57:16,467
on the market.

1143
00:57:16,501 --> 00:57:19,970
Number two, they make
pretty much all the silicone

1144
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:21,806
sold in this country.

1145
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,809
Number three, they were sued,

1146
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:29,213
and it was their desire to
not have to pay $3 billion.

1147
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:35,953
So Dow Corning took some money
from its marketing budget,

1148
00:57:35,986 --> 00:57:37,287
not its research budget,

1149
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:39,289
but from its marketing budget,

1150
00:57:39,323 --> 00:57:43,861
and started hiring academic
researchers to do studies

1151
00:57:44,895 --> 00:57:48,766
that would show that
their implants were safe.

1152
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:53,771
- [Reporter] Some believed the
Harvard,

1153
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,240
and Mayo Clinic studies
are seriously flawed,

1154
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,474
concerned that the research,

1155
00:57:57,508 --> 00:57:59,476
and some of the researchers
themselves

1156
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,979
were funded by breast implant
makers,

1157
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:05,482
that the studies didn't follow
enough women for long enough.

1158
00:58:05,516 --> 00:58:09,053
And that they focused on the
wrong thing.

1159
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:15,125
- You have the ability to take
a little bit of information,

1160
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:19,530
and pretend that it
answers all your questions.

1161
00:58:19,564 --> 00:58:24,068
When it, number one, can't
possibly answer those questions.

1162
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:26,971
And number two, was never
designed to answer the questions

1163
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:30,307
because the people paying for
the studies

1164
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,178
made sure that the questions
were asked in a way

1165
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:37,314
that would make their product
look good.

1166
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,515
- At the end of the day,

1167
00:58:38,549 --> 00:58:41,318
they did those studies to
sell silicone implants again.

1168
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:45,055
I mean, I think we can never
discount individual experiences

1169
00:58:45,089 --> 00:58:48,358
because here what we have
are a group of healthy women,

1170
00:58:48,392 --> 00:58:50,460
they get their breast implants
put in,

1171
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,362
and all of a sudden they don't
feel well.

1172
00:58:52,396 --> 00:58:53,397
- Right.

1173
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:54,498
- And then they get
their implants taken out,

1174
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,465
and they feel better.

1175
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:56,400
- [Michelle] Right.

1176
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:58,569
- So I don't think you can
discount that.

1177
00:58:58,603 --> 00:59:01,338
Is it as good as a large control
study?

1178
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:06,143
No, but certainly I think that
should raise flags and say,

1179
00:59:06,176 --> 00:59:09,580
hey, something's definitely
going on here.

1180
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:19,189
- At some point, what was
happening is the plastic
surgeons

1181
00:59:19,223 --> 00:59:22,459
were saying there are
now dozens of studies

1182
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,995
showing how safe breast implants
are.

1183
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:27,865
And a lot of those dozens
of studies were published

1184
00:59:27,898 --> 00:59:32,236
by the same researchers funded
by the implant manufacturers,

1185
00:59:32,269 --> 00:59:36,006
and their summary was there's no
evidence.

1186
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,843
(dramatic music)

1187
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,449
- The multiple randomized
prospective studies

1188
00:59:45,482 --> 00:59:48,118
that have been performed
show no demonstrable link

1189
00:59:48,152 --> 00:59:49,887
between silicone gel breast
implants,

1190
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,089
and health or safety concerns
for women.

1191
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:54,291
- The scientific studies
have failed to demonstrate

1192
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,294
that women with these devices
have greater health risk

1193
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:59,063
than women without implants.

1194
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,330
- There are treatment options
available,

1195
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,467
which foster the safety,
efficacy, and patient
satisfaction

1196
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,502
of silicone breast implants,
thank you.

1197
01:00:05,535 --> 01:00:07,371
- There is major medical news
tonight

1198
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,674
about silicone breast implants.

1199
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:13,010
Late today, the FDA approved
them for use

1200
01:00:13,043 --> 01:00:15,479
lifting a ban that has been in
effect

1201
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:17,447
for more than a decade.

1202
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:21,451
- The Food and Drug
Administration Advisory panel

1203
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:23,053
voted seven to two,

1204
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:24,154
to recommend approving the sale

1205
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:25,656
of silicone gel breast implants

1206
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,558
by the Mentor Company of
Santa Barbara, California.

1207
01:00:28,592 --> 01:00:31,495
Stock price ballooned 40
points after the approval.

1208
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:33,931
(laughter)

1209
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:36,066
We'll be right back.

1210
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,236
(cheers and applause)

1211
01:00:44,675 --> 01:00:48,345
- I definitely feel my
heart beating faster.

1212
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,546
Is that normal?

1213
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:54,418
- [Nurse] It is, just a little
bit of nerves and anxiety.

1214
01:00:57,688 --> 01:00:59,556
- [Michelle] My whole life is
about to change completely.

1215
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:02,659
I'm scared, I'm nervous, I'm
petrified.

1216
01:01:02,693 --> 01:01:04,061
- [Nurse] All done.

1217
01:01:04,094 --> 01:01:05,362
- All right, so I'm gonna go
ahead,

1218
01:01:05,395 --> 01:01:06,530
and put some markings on you.

1219
01:01:06,563 --> 01:01:07,397
You feel okay?

1220
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:08,232
- I do.

1221
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:11,736
- [Dr. Chun] Swing your legs
around.

1222
01:01:11,769 --> 01:01:13,370
- [Michelle] If this doesn't
work

1223
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,739
it's back to the drawing board,

1224
01:01:14,772 --> 01:01:17,641
but I know so much that I'm
right.

1225
01:01:19,543 --> 01:01:24,081
I know that I'm gonna feel
so much better after this.

1226
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,722
- Piece of cake, get those guys
out.

1227
01:01:31,756 --> 01:01:34,291
(soft music)

1228
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:47,571
- She's sound asleep, all right.

1229
01:01:52,777 --> 01:01:56,613
So the surgery consists of
removing their implants,

1230
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,050
but also the surrounding scar
tissue,

1231
01:02:00,084 --> 01:02:02,052
otherwise known as a capsule.

1232
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:04,021
They don't want any foreign
material,

1233
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:09,059
foreign body left behind, so
they want everything taken out.

1234
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,672
The reason why there is
so few plastic surgeons

1235
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:26,343
performing the procedure, as
I think it should be done,

1236
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:30,280
remove the entire capsule
is because of this belief

1237
01:02:30,314 --> 01:02:34,251
that implants do not
cause any health problems.

1238
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:39,389
So I've just now freed
up the entire implant.

1239
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:43,293
Her implant is inside the sac.

1240
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:44,494
I think it's intact.

1241
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:48,098
I can't quite tell because
obviously we haven't opened it.

1242
01:02:48,132 --> 01:02:50,634
You know, women seeing
things on social media

1243
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:52,102
are finally realizing,

1244
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:55,572
hey, everyone else has the same
problem.

1245
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,174
And a lot of them are getting
better.

1246
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,476
So I'm gonna look into that.

1247
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,347
Since the early '90s,

1248
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,449
that's when Connie Chung broke
that story,

1249
01:03:05,482 --> 01:03:08,318
and actually when the floodgate
opened.

1250
01:03:08,352 --> 01:03:09,453
- [Reporter] But decades later,

1251
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:11,655
social media provides a place

1252
01:03:11,688 --> 01:03:15,425
for a new generation of
women to commiserate.

1253
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:16,760
- It's been, like, absolutely
horrific,

1254
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,395
like, the amount of pain,

1255
01:03:18,428 --> 01:03:21,498
and, like, suffering that
I've had to go through.

1256
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,500
- [Reporter] There are
thousands of women who do find

1257
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,135
that they have these types of
symptoms,

1258
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:27,504
but there have been many
large-scale scientific studies

1259
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:28,772
that don't appear to show

1260
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,409
that breast implant illness even
exists.

1261
01:03:32,442 --> 01:03:36,380
- It's being ridiculed,
denied, talked down to.

1262
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,616
I'm afraid to ask for help.

1263
01:03:40,851 --> 01:03:42,619
- [Reporter] Within the medical
community,

1264
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:46,523
little to no credibility is
given to possible connections

1265
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:49,093
between illness and implants.

1266
01:03:49,894 --> 01:03:53,663
- Spoiler alert, it was
my freaking implants.

1267
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,402
- So we'll leave that on the
back table.

1268
01:03:58,435 --> 01:04:00,670
So we just have to get
all the bleeding stopped,

1269
01:04:00,704 --> 01:04:01,738
and we'll be done.

1270
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:05,442
After their surgery, I
can't explain exactly why,

1271
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:07,144
but they seem to get better.

1272
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:10,780
What I like to see happen
is this whole issue

1273
01:04:12,917 --> 01:04:16,686
becomes more of a
recognized medical issue,

1274
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,724
not imagined symptoms by
a bunch of crazy women

1275
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:24,895
'cause that's how this is
portrayed at this point.

1276
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,234
- [David] My wife's awake, hold
on.

1277
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:32,602
Wow, she powered out of that.

1278
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,674
Honey.

1279
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,542
- Uh-hum.

1280
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:39,409
- [David] Hi.

1281
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:40,277
- Hi.

1282
01:04:40,310 --> 01:04:41,678
- [David] How are you?

1283
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:42,913
- How'd it go?

1284
01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:45,615
- It went great, how are you
feeling?

1285
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,583
- Oh, tired.

1286
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,218
- [David] Tired, you
want to keep sleeping?

1287
01:04:48,252 --> 01:04:49,486
- Keep sleeping.

1288
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:51,455
- [David] Okay, I'm right here,
okay?

1289
01:04:51,488 --> 01:04:52,322
- Yeah.

1290
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:54,624
- [David] Okay, love you.

1291
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:56,193
- [Michelle] How are the
capsules?

1292
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:59,396
- [David] Capsules, I'm
gonna check it out now, okay?

1293
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:00,230
All right?

1294
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:01,966
Do you want to see it later,
yeah?

1295
01:05:01,999 --> 01:05:04,568
Okay, I'm gonna go check it out
now, okay?

1296
01:05:04,601 --> 01:05:05,435
All right.

1297
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,271
- At the end of every procedure
I do,

1298
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:09,506
I always examine the
capsule and the implants,

1299
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:12,509
so that I can determine if
there are any abnormalities.

1300
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:15,512
So at the end of the day,
you know what we see here,

1301
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:20,317
I think, it's interesting,
but it's not diagnostic.

1302
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:21,952
They all came out in one piece,
you know,

1303
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:23,853
there's nothing leaking out.

1304
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:24,788
- [David] Can I ask,

1305
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:25,322
do you have a prediction
on either of them?

1306
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:26,356
Do you think either?

1307
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:27,857
- [Dr. Chun] I don't
think this one's gonna be.

1308
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:29,459
This one, maybe, maybe not.

1309
01:05:29,493 --> 01:05:32,696
This one, I don't think
it's ruptured the left one.

1310
01:05:32,729 --> 01:05:33,797
So I'll take a look.

1311
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,465
- [David] Yeah.

1312
01:05:35,499 --> 01:05:36,800
- [Dr. Chun] Now you
always want to make sure

1313
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:39,903
that you don't cut the implant
yourself.

1314
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,738
So this one's intact.

1315
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,973
- [David] Okay.

1316
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:46,410
- [Dr. Chun] So this one looks
like,

1317
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:48,712
this one's intact as well.

1318
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:49,513
- [David] Two intact ones.

1319
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:52,716
- Uh-hmm, so they're both
intact,

1320
01:05:52,749 --> 01:05:55,285
but, again, whether you see
things or not,

1321
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,921
doesn't correlate with whether
you have symptoms or not.

1322
01:05:57,954 --> 01:06:00,290
Because, again, I think the
problem is

1323
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,959
it's a reaction to the silicone
materials,

1324
01:06:02,993 --> 01:06:04,528
whether it's broken or not,

1325
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:07,797
saline, silicone doesn't
really seem to matter

1326
01:06:07,831 --> 01:06:10,934
because it's the shell
that's got silicone.

1327
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:11,801
- [David] Thank you so much.

1328
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:12,969
- You're welcome.

1329
01:06:13,003 --> 01:06:16,673
They'll process it and then
we'll give it back to her.

1330
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:17,674
- Two days from now?

1331
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:18,608
- When she comes back,
yeah, when she comes in.

1332
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:19,909
- [David] Great.

1333
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:24,614
It's what, two days after the
surgery?

1334
01:06:24,648 --> 01:06:25,515
- Yeah.

1335
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:30,520
It feels really weird,
they're just so little.

1336
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:34,624
Oh my God, little, usually,
I'd be out to here.

1337
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:35,292
- [David] Yeah.

1338
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:37,761
- I'm totally flat-chested.

1339
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:41,331
They're gonna be like
pancakes, I can tell.

1340
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:44,301
So get some syrup, and some
butter.

1341
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:46,970
- Hi, how are you?

1342
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:48,838
- Dr. Chun, I'm so little.

1343
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:50,374
- Huh?
- I'm so little.

1344
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,342
- That's what Mother
Nature intended you to be.

1345
01:06:52,376 --> 01:06:53,009
- Yes, that is what
Mother Nature intended.

1346
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:53,877
- That's you.

1347
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:54,944
- You are right.

1348
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:58,315
- All right, so how do
you feel more importantly?

1349
01:06:58,348 --> 01:07:00,917
- Pain-wise, what, a two, maybe.

1350
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:01,851
- [Dr. Chun] That's great.

1351
01:07:01,885 --> 01:07:02,552
- There's really no pain.

1352
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:03,687
- [Dr. Chun] No, that's good.

1353
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,955
- Soreness, it feels like
when I got my implants in.

1354
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:08,458
- Sure, so all the bad things,

1355
01:07:08,492 --> 01:07:11,027
all the worst things happen
in that first 48 hours.

1356
01:07:11,061 --> 01:07:12,262
- [Michelle] Right.

1357
01:07:12,296 --> 01:07:14,564
- So going forward, things are
gonna start getting better.

1358
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:15,732
- [Michelle] Good.

1359
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,367
- Even if you do nothing,
things are gonna get better.

1360
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:18,602
So the worst is behind you
already.

1361
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:19,603
- [Michelle] Okay.

1362
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:20,137
- Each day it's gonna
get a little bit better,

1363
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:20,837
a little bit better.

1364
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:24,474
- From your mouth to God's ears.

1365
01:07:24,508 --> 01:07:25,875
I just can't believe how little
I am,

1366
01:07:25,909 --> 01:07:27,944
like, really, really little.

1367
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,113
- Does it surprise you, are you?

1368
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:32,416
- My belly is bigger than my
boobs got to work on that.

1369
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:34,884
- [David] Are you not upset
that they're so small?

1370
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:35,585
Then you're cool.

1371
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:37,721
- No, I am not, I am so happy.

1372
01:07:37,754 --> 01:07:40,124
I'm able to detox and regain my
health.

1373
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:43,793
- There you go, I love
you, no matter what.

1374
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:44,894
- I love you.

1375
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:47,431
Day 10.

1376
01:07:47,464 --> 01:07:48,698
- [David] Day 10, really?

1377
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:49,566
- [Michelle] Day 10.

1378
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:50,567
- [David] Generally, how do you
feel?

1379
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:52,736
- Yesterday morning was
a rough morning for me,

1380
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:57,073
and I feel, like, weak and
I could possibly pass out.

1381
01:07:57,107 --> 01:07:58,007
I've never passed out,

1382
01:07:58,041 --> 01:08:00,510
but I think that's what it feels
like, so.

1383
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:03,613
This feels great healing
beautifully.

1384
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:08,084
This is not quite there,
still lightheaded.

1385
01:08:09,853 --> 01:08:13,523
Didn't expect it to last this
long, but my body needs time.

1386
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:17,594
Blood flow is brand new
after 30 years, I guess.

1387
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:21,030
It's got to find its way back to
my brain.

1388
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:26,069
Three months after, some
things have improved,

1389
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:27,771
but not everything.

1390
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:34,110
I'm definitely not one who
woke up and was healed.

1391
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:38,882
So we are going to get my
toxicology reports of my hair,

1392
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,518
skin, nails, blood.

1393
01:08:44,654 --> 01:08:46,756
This will show what, if
anything,

1394
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:50,927
has been leached into my
body from these implants.

1395
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,063
I do expect to find something
because I know I'm not crazy.

1396
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:56,132
I know the way that I feel.

1397
01:08:56,166 --> 01:09:00,170
So there's something going
on from these things.

1398
01:09:06,543 --> 01:09:07,577
Okay, here we go.

1399
01:09:07,611 --> 01:09:10,947
Oh, I'm not gonna be able
to read these things.

1400
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,848
Let's see.

1401
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:19,523
Unknown chemicals and toxins.

1402
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,626
What they found in my pee.

1403
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,895
Dioctyl phthalate, the
plasticizer,

1404
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:29,799
and organosilicones
detected in trace amounts.

1405
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,236
I mean, organosilicone sounds
like

1406
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:34,137
it has to do with the implants.

1407
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,506
It's obviously from these.

1408
01:09:45,882 --> 01:09:48,218
(soft music)

1409
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:57,026
I'm Michelle.

1410
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:57,727
- [Dr. Patten] Welcome.

1411
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:58,595
- [Michelle] Nice to meet you.

1412
01:09:58,628 --> 01:10:00,830
Have a look, tell me what you
think.

1413
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:03,533
There are hair, urine and skin.

1414
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:12,809
- The silicones leak from the
implant,

1415
01:10:12,842 --> 01:10:16,179
and they do travel in your body,
so,

1416
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:21,050
and it looks like it migrated
all over you, it's all over.

1417
01:10:21,084 --> 01:10:23,152
So you're a typical case.

1418
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,523
A low molecular weight silicone,

1419
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,157
which is what they detected.

1420
01:10:28,191 --> 01:10:29,158
- [Michelle] Right.

1421
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:32,762
- Dimethylsiloxane is
the immune stimulant.

1422
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:34,731
Do you know what kind of implant
you had?

1423
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:35,565
- [Michelle] Mentor.

1424
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:36,266
- Yeah.

1425
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,935
- Mentor smooth silicone gel.

1426
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:41,137
- And the capsule did it have?

1427
01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:42,872
- Full en bloc.
- Yeah.

1428
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:46,242
- And things are slowly getting
better.

1429
01:10:46,276 --> 01:10:51,581
- The usual patient that has
complete removal does recover

1430
01:10:51,615 --> 01:10:52,982
about two years later.

1431
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:55,218
- I was gonna say in time,
in time, Dr. Patten, yeah.

1432
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,119
- [Dr. Patten] It takes about
two years.

1433
01:10:56,152 --> 01:10:57,186
- Yes.

1434
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,324
- So your body is actually
mobilizing the silicone.

1435
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:01,491
- What does that mean
mobilizing the silicone?

1436
01:11:01,525 --> 01:11:05,194
- Excreted in the urine, or
in the stool, in the bile.

1437
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:05,995
- [Michelle] Yes.

1438
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:07,864
- And if there's no more coming
in

1439
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:10,266
chances are you're going to
recover.

1440
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,236
Believe it or not, the company's
knew,

1441
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:15,171
the silicone migrating.

1442
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,607
- So then, Dr. Patten,
why do they keep saying

1443
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:20,043
the data says there's no harm?

1444
01:11:21,177 --> 01:11:23,112
- This is the whole
thing, it's a cover up.

1445
01:11:23,146 --> 01:11:24,280
Don't you get it?

1446
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:26,082
Okay, it fools the people.

1447
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,318
It's like President Grant's

1448
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:35,825
physician wrote a paper that
Grant's cancer of the mouth

1449
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:39,996
was due to smoking too
many cigars, that was 1870.

1450
01:11:41,698 --> 01:11:43,199
The medical literature since
that time

1451
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:46,035
is full of smoking causes lung
cancer.

1452
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:46,903
- Tobacco, yeah.

1453
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,673
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease.

1454
01:11:49,706 --> 01:11:52,075
And some tobacco companies
fought it like crazy.

1455
01:11:52,108 --> 01:11:54,110
They made it look like
it was controversial

1456
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,380
that the evidence wasn't good
enough,

1457
01:11:56,413 --> 01:11:58,715
or that there was a
reasonable group of scientists

1458
01:11:58,748 --> 01:12:00,684
who thought differently, et
cetera.

1459
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:04,320
There are economic forces at
work here.

1460
01:12:04,354 --> 01:12:05,489
- That's true.

1461
01:12:05,522 --> 01:12:08,057
- Billions of dollars are at
stake in plastic surgeons.

1462
01:12:08,091 --> 01:12:08,992
- [Michelle] Billions, yes.

1463
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:10,193
- Billions, we're talking about
billions.

1464
01:12:10,226 --> 01:12:14,831
- Yes, 0.1% of doctors are
willing to know what you know,

1465
01:12:14,864 --> 01:12:16,199
and are willing to talk about it
I'm sure.

1466
01:12:16,232 --> 01:12:18,334
- I agree with you, I agree with
you.

1467
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:22,706
After accumulating 2,000
sick women with implants,

1468
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:25,875
they have to be convinced by the
evidence.

1469
01:12:25,909 --> 01:12:29,413
This is what Shakespeare
calls ocular proof.

1470
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:30,914
I see it myself.

1471
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:33,650
So I don't care what people say

1472
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:35,719
because they haven't seen the
cases.

1473
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:36,753
They don't know it.

1474
01:12:36,786 --> 01:12:37,721
- [Michelle] Right.

1475
01:12:37,754 --> 01:12:38,988
- They don't even know what
they're doing.

1476
01:12:39,022 --> 01:12:41,190
They are ignorant.

1477
01:12:41,224 --> 01:12:43,760
(soft music)

1478
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:50,700
- [Reporter] A report just
released from MD Anderson

1479
01:12:50,734 --> 01:12:51,768
this morning,

1480
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:52,802
researchers looked at the
largest group of women

1481
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:55,138
with breast implants
that's ever been studied.

1482
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:57,173
- Now they found there's a
higher risk of rare diseases

1483
01:12:57,206 --> 01:13:00,944
among these women than in
those without implants.

1484
01:13:00,977 --> 01:13:03,179
- The alarming news about breast
implants,

1485
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,347
we've found evidence,

1486
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,349
they could be linked to a deadly
cancer.

1487
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,017
- [Reporter] A cancer of the
immune system

1488
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:10,987
linked to breast implants called
ALCL.

1489
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:13,690
The FDA told NBC News
it will meet next year

1490
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,926
to discuss concerns about their
safety.

1491
01:13:21,965 --> 01:13:26,002
- I got PIP breast
implants in Dallas in 1998.

1492
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:28,705
I developed chronic fatigue,
and auto-immune disease.

1493
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:32,208
Other symptoms were swollen
lymph nodes, recurrent fever,

1494
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:34,343
brain fog, and more.

1495
01:13:34,377 --> 01:13:37,413
- My memory became so concerning
to me.

1496
01:13:37,447 --> 01:13:39,949
I asked specifically to
start undergoing testing

1497
01:13:39,983 --> 01:13:41,384
for Alzheimer's.

1498
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:43,219
- I started then having flu-like
symptoms

1499
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:44,488
that I could not relieve.

1500
01:13:44,521 --> 01:13:47,190
This health crisis affects all
of us,

1501
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,859
and has been going on for
decades.

1502
01:13:49,893 --> 01:13:51,961
- It's a vicious circle, you
know.

1503
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:55,064
You can even compare it to rape
cases.

1504
01:13:55,098 --> 01:13:58,935
Fundamentally women aren't
believed.

1505
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:00,003
- I'm a little emotional

1506
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:03,940
because I still have
implants, and I'm very sick.

1507
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:06,843
- I was prepared to say
goodbye to my family

1508
01:14:06,876 --> 01:14:08,812
because I didn't think

1509
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:11,047
that I was gonna make
it through all of this.

1510
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:14,083
- At some point we have to
stop and listen to women,

1511
01:14:14,117 --> 01:14:16,920
and look at them and say, I
believe you.

1512
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:19,155
I believe that you're in pain.

1513
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:22,759
And I want to do something to
help that.

1514
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,127
- We must have better informed
consent,

1515
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,462
so the patients can determine
the risk are low enough

1516
01:14:26,496 --> 01:14:27,463
to implant or not.

1517
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,966
- Respectfully, I employ
you to require surgeons

1518
01:14:29,999 --> 01:14:31,901
to provide informed consent.

1519
01:14:31,935 --> 01:14:34,137
- Everyone deserves to have
a choice, I agree with that,

1520
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:38,041
but we deserve to have an
informed choice.

1521
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:39,475
- You have the power to make
that happen.

1522
01:14:39,509 --> 01:14:42,078
Please do what is right.

1523
01:14:42,111 --> 01:14:43,446
Thank you for allowing to speak.

1524
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:45,882
(applause)

1525
01:14:51,521 --> 01:14:54,290
- This morning, the FDA's
call for a new warning

1526
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,326
for the most popular cosmetic
procedure in the world.

1527
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,263
We are talking about breast
implants.

1528
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:02,899
- The FDA is proposing all
breast implants

1529
01:15:02,932 --> 01:15:05,434
contain a black box warning.

1530
01:15:05,468 --> 01:15:08,204
That label is the strictest
warning attached to a product,

1531
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:11,307
meaning it comes with hazards,
including loss of life.

1532
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,377
- However, those warnings would
only be seen by the surgeon,

1533
01:15:14,410 --> 01:15:17,180
not the patient because
unlike medications,

1534
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:21,484
patients don't see
implant boxes, or labels.

1535
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:23,419
- [Terri] Dr. Potter says
her hope is that the FDA

1536
01:15:23,452 --> 01:15:26,422
will do more to make sure
patients are informed.

1537
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,793
For the KV Defenders, I'm Terri
Gruca.

1538
01:15:39,335 --> 01:15:41,838
(soft music)

1539
01:15:50,113 --> 01:15:51,347
- [Michelle] For 15 plus years,

1540
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:53,617
I was told by every doctor that
I saw

1541
01:15:53,650 --> 01:15:56,586
that implants were 100% safe.

1542
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,187
So now I'm sitting here
wondering

1543
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:00,624
is this new mandate by the FDA
enough

1544
01:16:00,657 --> 01:16:04,928
to change the doctor's
minds about implant safety?

1545
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:07,296
(soft music)

1546
01:16:22,245 --> 01:16:24,347
- [Dr. Rose] At these recent FDA
hearings,

1547
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:27,383
the newest thing, from what I
understand,

1548
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,620
is to put a black box
label on the implant.

1549
01:16:30,654 --> 01:16:32,956
- Well, that's why I'm here.

1550
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:36,893
The black box warning would
you warn your patients?

1551
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,394
- Breast implant illness does
exist.

1552
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:42,431
- Well, that in of itself is
validated.

1553
01:16:42,465 --> 01:16:46,636
- It exists, but I have
experience with maybe

1554
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:49,272
six or 7,000 implant patients,

1555
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:54,944
and out of all these
thousands of patients of mine,

1556
01:16:54,978 --> 01:16:58,514
I can only think of
three, or four, or five,

1557
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:05,889
that have had what we would
call connective tissue disease.

1558
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:10,559
And so I see so many patients
that are doing so well,

1559
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:12,962
years and years and years and
years later.

1560
01:17:12,996 --> 01:17:14,030
- Yeah, it won't affect
everybody for sure.

1561
01:17:14,063 --> 01:17:16,565
- So does that mean you
just take all the implants

1562
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:17,801
off the shelves,

1563
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:19,568
and all these 10 million women
that are implanted worldwide

1564
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:21,570
what happens then, you know?

1565
01:17:21,604 --> 01:17:22,571
- [Michelle] Well, true,

1566
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:25,241
but you take the
responsibility off of yourself.

1567
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:26,075
- Right, right.

1568
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,043
- [Michelle] With full
disclosure.

1569
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:29,078
- And if you follow
that black box warning,

1570
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,614
and you had said to me,
Michelle, you're 33.

1571
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:33,182
These got to come out because,

1572
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:35,218
no, at 33 I wouldn't have done.

1573
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,953
I'm telling you Dr. Rose, I know
me.

1574
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,554
- Michelle, you're
hanging out in the clubs.

1575
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:39,555
You're a young, beautiful girl.

1576
01:17:39,588 --> 01:17:41,090
- No, at 33 I was not,
I was a professional.

1577
01:17:41,124 --> 01:17:43,426
I was working, and I had two
kids.

1578
01:17:43,459 --> 01:17:45,228
I was not hanging out
anywhere, darlin' trust me.

1579
01:17:45,261 --> 01:17:48,131
- These girls, the young
patients,

1580
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,266
it's beauty, beauty,
beauty, beauty, beauty.

1581
01:17:50,299 --> 01:17:51,500
- And I understand.

1582
01:17:51,534 --> 01:17:55,038
I'm in the vainest, vainest
industry there is, Hollywood.

1583
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:56,973
I am telling you I get it,

1584
01:17:57,006 --> 01:17:59,075
but I also am telling
you because I care more,

1585
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,610
you cannot money cannot buy you
health.

1586
01:18:01,644 --> 01:18:02,779
- Absolutely.

1587
01:18:02,812 --> 01:18:06,149
- So if somebody, if you Dr.
Rose, who I respect said,

1588
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:10,486
Michelle, there's a small
percentage that there is a
chance

1589
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,989
that you can get a neurological,
or autoimmune disorder.

1590
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,558
And then you said, there's
a black box warning on this.

1591
01:18:15,591 --> 01:18:17,293
I would go, uh.

1592
01:18:17,326 --> 01:18:19,495
- But it's very difficult.

1593
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,430
I think it's a very difficult
situation

1594
01:18:21,464 --> 01:18:25,568
because you just can't say
exactly what percentage

1595
01:18:25,601 --> 01:18:28,271
could have an adverse reaction.

1596
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:30,306
- All I want is transparency
for the women out there

1597
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:32,408
who are getting implanted
'cause I'm telling you,

1598
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:35,211
I know me because I've
struggled for so long,

1599
01:18:35,244 --> 01:18:38,147
have to advocate for myself
'cause nobody else will.

1600
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:39,715
So at least I'm armed
with the information.

1601
01:18:39,749 --> 01:18:41,350
And then if something
happens, I get to go,

1602
01:18:41,384 --> 01:18:44,720
well, he told me this could
happen, I didn't listen.

1603
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:47,090
- Michelle, you're not the first
patient

1604
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:48,657
that I've had this discussion
with.

1605
01:18:48,691 --> 01:18:49,826
- [Michelle] I bet.

1606
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:54,463
- And I wish I could get my
arms more well around it,

1607
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:55,664
you know?

1608
01:18:55,698 --> 01:19:00,269
I just wish I could understand
the whole process better.

1609
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:01,637
- I don't want to be in this
position.

1610
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,505
I don't want to be sick.

1611
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:03,472
- [Dr. Rose] Right.

1612
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:06,810
- It's not a made up
thing because it's real.

1613
01:19:06,843 --> 01:19:09,212
My blood, and my urine,
and my hair, and my skin

1614
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:11,480
will show you that it's real.

1615
01:19:11,514 --> 01:19:15,384
It's not made up, but,
and you acknowledge that,

1616
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:18,087
but the point is, I guess, to
wrap it up

1617
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:22,158
the black box warning
will you tell the people?

1618
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:23,692
- Sure, of course.

1619
01:19:23,726 --> 01:19:26,429
I mean, when patients come in,

1620
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:29,065
so, typically, what you say is

1621
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,468
you'll talk about these 1%
things,

1622
01:19:32,501 --> 01:19:36,605
and then probably if they
would broach the subject

1623
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:40,276
a little bit, I'm happy
to talk to these patients.

1624
01:19:40,309 --> 01:19:42,145
Look, you've got to understand,
Michelle,

1625
01:19:42,178 --> 01:19:45,214
I'm not trying to at all
minimize breast implant illness.

1626
01:19:45,248 --> 01:19:46,082
I'm really not.

1627
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:47,016
- Good.

1628
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:47,984
- I think it's dreadful, it's
horrible.

1629
01:19:48,017 --> 01:19:50,253
I mean, what's particularly
dreadful to me

1630
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:54,423
is did I harm a patient
knowingly, or unknowingly?

1631
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,827
You know, I mean, it's
a little frightening.

1632
01:19:57,861 --> 01:19:58,661
- Right.

1633
01:19:58,694 --> 01:20:01,564
- But still, I mean, I don't
think

1634
01:20:01,597 --> 01:20:03,499
even though there's small little
risks,

1635
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:06,235
I continue to be a very ardent,

1636
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:10,139
and vocal supporter of
this biomedical device.

1637
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:19,448
They are beautiful little
objects, aren't they?

1638
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,885
Maybe it's not like looking at,
you know,

1639
01:20:21,918 --> 01:20:25,521
whales in the ocean, but it
is quite beautiful to me.

1640
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,656
I think these implants
are really, really safe.

1641
01:20:27,690 --> 01:20:29,325
I feel dreadful.

1642
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:31,760
This implant in my hands does
not rupture.

1643
01:20:31,794 --> 01:20:33,629
I would feel dreadful to think,

1644
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:37,666
and I've got a letter
from Mentor Corporation,

1645
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:41,804
ruptures reported in my
practice, 0% rupture rate.

1646
01:20:41,837 --> 01:20:43,172
And you could cut this,

1647
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:44,773
and you would see this is a gel.

1648
01:20:44,807 --> 01:20:49,512
It's a very viscous, it's
a very viscous biomaterial.

1649
01:20:49,545 --> 01:20:51,514
It is a beautiful implant

1650
01:20:51,547 --> 01:20:55,751
in 99 plus, plus, plus percent
of patients

1651
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:59,655
it's a very safe biomaterial
in my estimation.

1652
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,494
- I think most plastic surgeons
are proud of their work,

1653
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:10,533
and they don't want to believe
that these breast implants

1654
01:21:10,900 --> 01:21:13,669
that they've been putting
in all these women

1655
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,439
are causing serious health
problems.

1656
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:19,675
And I think plastic
surgeons like anybody else,

1657
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,778
we all want to believe that
the work we do is worthwhile,

1658
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:25,448
and we don't want to believe
that we've been doing something

1659
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:27,283
that's harmed people.

1660

My name is Michelle Visage,

and these are what's left of my
tits.

(cheers)

1666
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:01,884
Full stop.

1667
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:05,888
I've recently gotten my
breast implants out, right?

1668
01:22:07,556 --> 01:22:09,892
Along the line I found
out something about myself

1669
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:11,294
that I didn't expect to.

1670
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:12,828
When I got them, I was 21 years
old,

1671
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,431
and my record company was run by
men.

1672
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:16,699
I was signed by men.

1673
01:22:16,732 --> 01:22:17,933
My production company was men,

1674
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:20,803
and they all told me all along,
you know, you're really hot,

1675
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:23,539
but you'd be sexier with boobs,
right?

1676
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:26,342
What I realized when I was
healing was that all those years

1677
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,611
of I thought that I was
doing it for myself,

1678
01:22:28,644 --> 01:22:29,812
and anybody that listens to the
podcast,

1679
01:22:29,845 --> 01:22:32,881
you've heard me argue with
Ru, say, no, I did it for me.

1680
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:35,451
And I partially did it
for me, and by the way,

1681
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:37,753
I'm not anti-plastic surgery.

1682
01:22:37,786 --> 01:22:40,589
No, if you want it get it,
but know what you're doing,

1683
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,358
and know who you're doing it
for.

1684
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:44,660
And at the end of the
day, I am 50 years old,

1685
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:48,264
and I love my small tits for
the first time in my life.

1686
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,400
(cheers and applause)

1687
01:22:51,434 --> 01:22:53,669
And I ain't doing it for
anybody apart from myself.

1688
01:22:53,702 --> 01:22:55,571
So when you look in the mirror
today,

1689
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:57,306
today right now is all we have.

1690
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,508
We don't have tomorrow,
it's not guaranteed.

1691
01:22:59,542 --> 01:23:00,909
So love yourself for who you
are.

1692
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:04,280
You are beautiful and perfect
just as you are today.

1693
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,315
(cheers and applause)

1694
01:23:06,349 --> 01:23:07,850
It's the truth.

* Broken land, broken hands

1698
01:23:42,051 --> 01:23:47,022
* Digging my way to the other
side *

1699
01:23:48,391 --> 01:23:53,396
* But the dirt and dust

1700
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:59,468
* Slide back into the hole

1701
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:04,907
* So I'll swallow that earth

1702
01:24:06,475 --> 01:24:11,480
* Until I'm burst full

1703
01:24:12,115 --> 01:24:15,017
* Found wanting

1704
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:20,055
* Oh dead on, oh love

1705
01:24:20,823 --> 01:24:25,828
* Your little world hid
fast base in shadow *

1706
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:37,673
* Your little world
tastes of sweet and sour *

1707
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:47,516
* One foot at a time girl,
one foot at a time girl *

1708
01:24:47,816 --> 01:24:52,788
* One foot at a time
girl, one foot at a time *

1709
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:58,727
* One foot at a time
girl, one foot at a time *

1710
01:25:18,581 --> 01:25:21,049
(bright music)
