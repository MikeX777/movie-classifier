Master wants you to go to Sixth Lady's room

00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:10,999
What for?

5
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:12,798
I don't know

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,832
Sure, we will go right away

7
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:16,107
Yes

8
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,077
Could Hsi-men found out what we were planning

9
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,312
Don't think too much of it

10
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:28,252
Hurry up

11
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,518
Remember what I said

12
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,354
Tell Wu-Song no to come back

13
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:34,492
Ten I shall leave

14
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,428
Sister, we must be careful

15
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:43,499
I will be careful

16
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:51,639
Master. Master

17
00:01:56,316 --> 00:01:57,647
You are all here

18
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,117
I feel really happy today

19
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,487
So I would like to chat with you all

20
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,219
I, Hsi-men Ching

21
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,657
These three words mean "bad boy”

22
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:15,862
Because except good things I can not do

23
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,792
I have done all the bad stuffs

24
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,470
Such as rape

25
00:02:22,342 --> 00:02:24,106
Murder

26
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,770
Anything that benefits me

27
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:29,844
I will do it

28
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,241
Some people don't like me

29
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,077
They curse behind my back

30
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,848
Said I did too much bad

31
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,252
And I won't get a son

32
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,594
I was afraid in the beginning

33
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:48,866
But now

34
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,104
I don't have to any more

35
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:58,110
Because Vase is pregnant

36
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,978
Vase started for you guys

37
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,188
You should work more harder

38
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:14,151
Who can give me a healthy son

39
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:16,458
I will give her one thousand dollars

40
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:21,223
And she will get a portion of my property

41
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,536
But, if nothing happens at all

42
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,766
Don't blame me for not being fair

43
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:37,875
Moon Lady, Vase has to eat more from now on

44
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,647
Make her healthy

45
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,779
Give birth to a healthy baby for me

46
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:13,518

Hsi-men Ching

64
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,152
It's you master Kao

00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,515
Long time no see, how's going?

00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,217
Not bad

67
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,263
It's just I miss you so much I could not sleep

68
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:36,033
Master Kao

69
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:39,130
It was a misunderstanding that day

70
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:41,768
People who didn't mean it is not guilty

71
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,239
Hope master Kao would forgive me

72
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:47,445
Don't worry

73
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,739
I won't kill you

74
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,682
I just want justice

75
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,854
Master, is something going to happen?

76
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:01,387
Nothing will happen

77
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:04,424
You guys go first, go

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,195
No need to hurry

79
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,898
Let her stay and watch

80
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,137
Maids can go if they want

81
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:19,844
You go, go...

82
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,379
Don't worry, nothing will happen

83
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:28,082
Young master Kao

84
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,617
I will admit what I have done

85
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,986
I will take the blame myself

86
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,657
You have to take the blame no matter what

87
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:43,765
Master Kao

88
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:47,331
Please don't say it in front of my wives

89
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,902
Can't they go first

90
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:58,478
Please, master Kao

91
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:01,912
I can't hear suddenly

92
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,547
Can you speak louder

93
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:08,686
Please

94
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:13,655
Good, let them go

95
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:16,462
Master

96
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,604
Wait for me outside

97
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,431
Nothing will happen, hurry, go

98
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,203
<i>Go</i>

103
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:37,189
You can say anything now

104
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,554
I was wrong, master Kao

105
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,064
You are so kind

106
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,565
Don't mind my mistakes

107
00:07:49,168 --> 00:07:51,569
I didn't know who you were then

108
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,105
Please forgive me

109
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:00,745
Hsi-men Ching

110
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,112
I thought you are a man

111
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:04,515
You too are scared of death

112
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,353
Of course I do

113
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,947
Only stupid people don't

114
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,187
Master Kao, let me go

115
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:18,093
I can give you women or money

116
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:20,396
I am very rich

117
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,402
And have five beautiful wives

118
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:27,336
I can share them with you

119
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,533
To repay your kindness

120
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:31,933
Hsi-men Ching, you are wrong

121
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:36,844
I came to this place

122
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,878
Not for your money

123
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:40,441
About women

124
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,445
I don't have a shortage of them either

125
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,248
I just want revenge

126
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:46,923
I don't want nothing except for this

127
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:49,159
Master Kao

128
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,061
If only you let me live

129
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,334
You can do anything to me

130
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,897
I don't like to bully others

131
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,838
But I don't like others to bully me

132
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,106
I get then I repay

133
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:10,712
Of course...You mean

134
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,416
If I didn't remember wrong

135
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:16,220
Someone wants me to drink yellow soup

136
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:16,849
Who?

137
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:20,923
It's me

138
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:23,692
What about now

139
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,561
I'll drink, but where?

140
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:30,332
Master Kao

141
00:09:31,103 --> 00:09:31,365
What do you say

142
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:36,637
Hurry

143
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:46,783
Hsi-men brother

144
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:47,849
I am sorry

145
00:09:48,454 --> 00:09:50,388
I can only pee on shoe

146
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:52,914
I have to tell everyone to pee

147
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:53,651
Come on...

148
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,858
Come...more...

149
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,048
Thanks for not killing me

150
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:23,580
Let's go

151
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,163
Are you OK, master

152
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,172
I'm alright

153
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,736
Take me bake

154
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:48,309
Be careful

155
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,561
Don't tell anyone about today

156
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:04,322
Vase knows

157
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,723
I won't let you go easy if you say it

158
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:08,360
Yes

159
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:12,530
Be careful

160
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,074
Do I look like I've been bully at?

161
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,077
No

162
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:26,144
But you walk strange

163
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,848
Strange my ass

164
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,147
Don't say anything when we go in

165
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:31,984
Yes

166
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,161
Hey, open up

167
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:37,688
coming...

168
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:42,327
Master

169
00:11:42,768 --> 00:11:44,463
You are so slow

170
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,235
Master, you are back

171
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:49,504
Of course

172
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:52,805
Yin said you were taken away by those bad guy

173
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,040
I was worried for you

174
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,212
What's there to worry about

175
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,152
Who dares do anything to me in this county

176
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:01,748
Then it OK

177
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:05,116
Because Yin said they are not from this county

178
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,285
And they are big-time

179
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:08,585
It's just a little misunderstanding

180
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:12,526
They were so polite to me
after they know who I am

181
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,391
Master, I will let kitchen
prepare something to eat for you

182
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:16,925
Eat what, I don't want to eat

183
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,098
Go get me a doctor

184
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,637
Eat...all you know is eat

185
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:21,503
Doctor

186
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,357
Master

187
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,589
Your pulse is not regular

188
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:42,720
You have kidney sickness

189
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:44,596
But nothing serious

190
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:47,595
You will get better after a few days rest

191
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,135
But, Lord

192
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:54,996
Don't get too close with women these days

193
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,444
I heard that saying for years

194
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:04,171
Every doctor says the same thing

195
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,983
It's like those women
has done something bad to you

196
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,389
I don't want you to tell me how to stay fit

197
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,185
I just ate something
wrong and felt like puking

198
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:19,787
Just get me some stomach medicine

199
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,562
Right

200
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,527
I smell something weird from your breath

201
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,831
Master, what did you eat wrong

202
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,266
Don't ask too much

203
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,534
What I ate is none of your business

204
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:32,938
Yes...

205
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,107
Did you want to know who
I slept with last night also?

206
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:36,907
Damn you...

207
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:38,750
Lord...

208
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:43,713
Look, listen, ask and touch are
the four important things for doctors

209
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,126
If I don't ask,
it might affect your health

210
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,161
OK, OK...you can go...

211
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:51,855
Yes

212
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:55,660
Come in

213
00:13:59,738 --> 00:13:59,931
Master

214
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,138
What?

215
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,775
Chin was caught and
sent back by the court

216
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,745
This little bastard

217
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:11,742
He can't run away from me

218
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:13,983
Where is Picture of Grace

219
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:15,920
Don't know, we just caught Chin

220
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:17,781
It's OK

221
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,821
Once we have Chin

222
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:23,893
We will get her soon

223
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:49,550
Speak

224
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:51,283
Speak

225
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,155
Where is Picture of Grace

226
00:14:58,931 --> 00:14:59,261
Chin

227
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,692
I treated you nice

228
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,497
If you tell the truth, I will let you go

229
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,038
Why take the blame

230
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:09,704
I---

231
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:12,845
I shall speak, but I have a request

232
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:15,646
What?

233
00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:17,973
I want to see the Fifth Lady

234
00:15:18,517 --> 00:15:21,452
If I don't see her,
I won't say anything

235
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:22,916
Sure

236
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,755
Fifth Lady,
master wants you to go to the lobby

237
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:30,994
What happened now?

238
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,329
Chin was caught

239
00:15:32,831 --> 00:15:33,559
Master wants to see you

240
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:37,896
OK, tell master

241
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,132
I will be there shortly

242
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,770
Yes, Fifth Lady

243
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:08,560
Who?

244
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:09,793
It's Plum Blossom

245
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,635
Fifth Lady,
why are you holding a pair of scissors

246
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:18,634
Chin was caught

247
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,771
He must can stand the beat

248
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,079
He probably told everything

249
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:25,312
This idiot, I told him to run far and away

250
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,486
How could he got caught

251
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:29,013
Plum Blossom

252
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:35,994
Thank god
I send Chen Ching-chi go rescue uncle

253
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,023
I have fulfill my only wish

254
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,401
If 1 die, I could die peacefully

255
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,269
Fifth Lady, just do it step by step

256
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:47,299
I think chin

257
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,907
Probably won't tell anything

258
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:05,350
Master

259
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,899
Chin, now that fifth Lady is here

260
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,359
Tell the truth

261
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:28,411
Stupid servant

262
00:17:28,914 --> 00:17:32,942
Where is Picture of Grace

263
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,116
Fifth Lady...
 am sorry to you

264
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:38,178
I did something I shouldn't do to you

265
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,491
It ruined your reputation

266
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,121
Chin is wrong, please forgive me

267
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:45,261
Quit the nonsense

268
00:17:46,298 --> 00:17:46,491
Speak

269
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,825
Where is that bitch

270
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,664
I killed her

271
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:53,798
Body

272
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,133
Is in the old well back in the garden

273
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,207
What, you killed Picture of Grace?

274
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,809
Yes, I killed her

275
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,779
I hate her,
because she wants to frame Fifth Lady

276
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:08,587
Because she ruined everything of mine

277
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,754
I hate her...

278
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:53,458
Men

279
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,430
Master

280
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:58,599
Feed his body to the dogs

281
00:18:59,071 --> 00:18:59,333
Yes

282
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,074
Come in

283
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:13,244
Fifth Lady

284
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,887
What made you so happy

285
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,422
Did you know Hsi-men Ching is in bad luck

286
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:19,583
Is that so

287
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,254
I never heard any one mention it

288
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:23,322
Of course no one dares say it

289
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:25,227
He was forced to eat shit

290
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,763
Who dares made him eat shit

291
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,096
This is called one
mountain is higher than another

292
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,062
He did something to Minister kao's son

293
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:34,970
This you master is so special

294
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:36,970
He didn't hit him and swear at him

295
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,806
He just forced him to eat a pile of shit

296
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,277
No wonder
he kept eating stomach medicine these days

297
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:46,351
Everyone knows this in Chin-he County

298
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,777
Jung even mad a song about it

299
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,451
Fate will decide everything

300
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,627
I think good luck is giving Hsi-men up

301
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:57,823
Bye the way, sister

302
00:19:58,463 --> 00:20:00,522
I've great news for you

303
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:01,694
What is it?

304
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:02,427
Do you know

305
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:04,528
Tomorrow is Emperor's
mother's seventieth birthday

306
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,365
Emperor will set everything free

307
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,069
Your uncle might be free,
you will see each other

308
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,237
really, great

309
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:17,340
But...

310
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:21,082
What,
you don't want uncle to be free?

311
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,285
It's good that he is free

312
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,183
But I don't want him back

313
00:20:26,825 --> 00:20:27,485
Why?

314
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,755
Think about it

315
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,529
What can he do after he is back

316
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,994
Ask him to take me away?

317
00:20:37,836 --> 00:20:40,328
Why not?
Unless he doesn't love you

318
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:42,969
No

319
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,142
You won't understand

320
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:48,146
He is a real man

321
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,748
So he won't do anything
that would make people laugh at him

322
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,982
If he is a real man

323
00:20:55,687 --> 00:20:57,177
He should know how to pay back

324
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,053
Rescue you from here

325
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,356
Besides, this is about you two

326
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,926
What's people got to say about it?

327
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:07,321
I know

328
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,399
This is impossible

329
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,799
And I don't wish him to do this

330
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,970
I can't do this, I can't

331
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,808
It's better he never comes back

332
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,011
OK, don't cry

333
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:01,678
Wu-Song, someone is looking for you

334
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,254
Sir, go get something to drink

335
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:09,087
Hurry

336
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,493
OK...

337
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,322
Brother Wu

338
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,699
You are...

339
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:17,827
Brother Wu

340
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,338
These are shoe Fifth Lady made for you

341
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,337
And these cakes

342
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,902
Does
she has anything to say to me

343
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,171
She...

344
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,446
She... she is dead

345
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:33,114
Dead?

346
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:35,512
What did you say?

347
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:37,487
She is dead

348
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:39,117
How did she die?

349
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,554
Brother Wu, let me go first

350
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,385
Let me tell you everything

351
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:44,526
Speak, are you lying to me

352
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,861
She won't die this easy

353
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:46,593
Speak

354
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:47,730
Hurry up

355
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,926
Let me tell you the truth, Brother Wu

356
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,671
She is not dead

357
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,739
But she wants me to tell you she is

358
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,869
She doesn't want you to go back

359
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,810
She doesn't want me to go back

360
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:06,976
What has happened to her?

361
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:09,546
After you committed murder

362
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:10,783
Caught by the court

363
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:12,715
She wants to rescue you

364
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,885
So she sold herself
to Hsi-men Ching for two hundred dollars

365
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:20,127
Now
she is the Fifth Lady of Hsi-men

366
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:22,792
You understand now

367
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,531
Why
she doesn't want you back

368
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:28,030
Brother Wu

369
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,740
Although I don't know your past

370
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,035
But I know

371
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,173
Fifth Lady treats you truly

372
00:23:36,815 --> 00:23:37,873
Although Hsi-men loves her

373
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,580
But I stayed there for a long period of time

374
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,621
I've never seen her laugh

375
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,457
She loves no one but you

376
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,360
Sister-in-law

377
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,029
Brother Wu

378
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:03,970
Don't run brother Wu

379
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,340
Don't run

380
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:14,779
Freeze

381
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:15,946
After him

382
00:24:49,187 --> 00:24:49,449
Uncle

383
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:53,685
Sister-in-law

384
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,691
What are you thinking

385
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,493
You are back uncle

386
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:00,498
Have you met Chen Ching-chi

387
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:02,833
You tell me

388
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,961
Why marry Hsi-men Ching

389
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:05,765
Why...

390
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:06,867
Why...

391
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,242
I...I want to rescue you

392
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,408
If I don't bribe the court,
you will get killed

393
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,307
I rather die

394
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,910
Then you marry that bastard

395
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,448
You should know it

396
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:22,449
Sister-in-law

397
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,163
Golden Lotus

398
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:17,891
What's wrong

399
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,136
It's a dream

400
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:22,571
I just dream a dream

401
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,369
You were killed in it

402
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,478
It really scared me

403
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,244
You cry so sadly

404
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:32,379
In fact

405
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,382
You do love me a little

406
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,619
Master you should know

407
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:40,716
If you are not here

408
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,760
My life will be a living hell,
of course I am sad

409
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,791
Golden Lotus, don't worry

410
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:51,569
I am still in good health

411
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:53,729
Not that easy to die

412
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,673
Infect, if something do happen to me

413
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,505
I've taken care of everything for you

414
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,212
If you are real to me

415
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:05,916
I won't let you suffer

416
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,322
I have no one here in Ching-he County

417
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:13,515
Who can I depend on but you

418
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:15,615
How can't I be real to you

419
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:19,727
It's great you think this way

420
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,598
We haven't done it for a long time

421
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,595
I'll tell Plum Blossom do some cooking

422
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:29,238
We should drink Happily today

423
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,807
By the way,
what was that you gave me last time

424
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:36,407
taste sweet, not bad

425
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,982
Master,
isn't your health not great these days

426
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,483
A little

427
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,520
But it's OK

428
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:50,290
I haven't had fun for a long time

429
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:52,388
I am almost sick

430
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:54,888
I almost forgot

431
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,267
I have something good for you

432
00:28:59,003 --> 00:28:59,936
What is it?

433
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:01,801
See

434
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,974
Master,
where did you get these

435
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,407
It from a relative of Ying

436
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,787
He got it from Japan

437
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,348
He said just do it according to the picture

438
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,582
You will feel so great

439
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:24,394
I don't...

440
00:29:27,532 --> 00:29:29,022
Master, the wine is warm now

441
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:32,662
Plum Blossom, let's drink it together

442
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:38,133
Here, have some too, Plum Blossom

443
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:38,668
Sure

444
00:29:43,848 --> 00:29:45,646
Golden Lotus, you too

445
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,248
I drink one

446
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,021
Master, don't drink too much

447
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,201
You are like a tiger every time you drink

448
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,434
Then we will suffer from you

449
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:07,963
Cheers

450
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:11,505
Master

451
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,876
I am a tiger now

452
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:28,123
Master

453
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,592
Don't run, come

454
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:37,359
Don't run...

455
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,666
Master...

456
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:39,467
Master...

457
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,075
Don't run...

458
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:50,943
Come...

459
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:03,625
Master...

460
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,132
Master! Are you alright?

461
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,882
Master, you are not in great health these days

462
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:13,921
rest more, don't play too much

463
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:17,190
I know myself

464
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,622
You don't have to tell me

465
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:22,726
Come in

466
00:33:26,204 --> 00:33:28,468
Master, First Lady, doctor is here

467
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,243
Lord Hsi-men

468
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:37,607
Madam

469
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:40,244
What, it's not doctor Chen

470
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,411
Doctor Chen went back to his home town

471
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,754
This female doctor is from Lo-yang city

472
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:45,915
She is famous

473
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,118
This is the first time
I heard about a female doctor

474
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,421
Mrs. Hsi-men

475
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,325
I learned my medication from my ancestors

476
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:56,728
In my family

477
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:58,832
I am the only daughter

478
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,228
But the name of Lo-yang Wong family

479
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:03,869
Won't fade away because I am a girl

480
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,101
No matter what

481
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,106
A male doctor is better

482
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,705
Since you think this way

483
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,576
Then I won't do anything

484
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,246
Please get another doctor

485
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:15,883
Don't go

486
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,750
I didn't say you can't do it

487
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,284
How about this

488
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,186
Show me what you've got

489
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,056
If you are for real

490
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:29,325
I won't treat you unfairly

491
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:33,632
Good

492
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,098
That me take a look at you

493
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,910
Please take your clothes off

494
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,542
Your pulse is strong

495
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,903
But it is not smooth

496
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:51,444
It seems like

497
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,947
You had stomach problems

498
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:57,250
You hurt your stomach

499
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:00,351
You might bleed

500
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,519
Not bad, you have something

501
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,595
Doctor, is that a big problem

502
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,901
If it's just stomach problems

503
00:36:11,302 --> 00:36:12,360
It's not a big deal

504
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,039
Just adjust your eating behavior

505
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,075
Then you should be OK

506
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,609
Doctor,
does he has any other problems

507
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,106
Problems

508
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,379
He has every other men's problem

509
00:36:27,051 --> 00:36:27,779
To be honest

510
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,682
He drinks and has too much women

511
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,153
He has to change it

512
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,489
I can't change it

513
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:42,497
If you want me to change

514
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,761
I rather die

515
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:46,834
Maybe it's not that serious

516
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,668
If you know how to take care of yourself

517
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:53,074
This problem of yours won't harm you

518
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,345
This is great

519
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:56,878
Moon Lady

520
00:36:57,748 --> 00:36:58,977
Go get some money

521
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:00,975
Thank this doctor well

522
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:02,215
Yes

523
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:09,057
Lord Hsi-men

524
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:10,255
Let me get you some medicine

525
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:35,913
Doctor

526
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,786
The treatment of my problem

527
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,485
Can you teach me

528
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:46,659
Lord, you really want to learn

529
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,257
If you teach me yourself

530
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,030
I don't care how expensive it is

531
00:37:55,906 --> 00:37:57,840
We'll talk about it some other day

532
00:37:59,143 --> 00:37:59,609
OK

533
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,971
It's a deal

534
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,385
Doctor

535
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:15,253
Mrs. Hsi-men

536
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,019
Cook this medicine

537
00:38:18,696 --> 00:38:19,356
Take it three days in a row

538
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,564
Don’t eat too much fried foods

539
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:24,597
This is for you

540
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:25,328
Thank you

541
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:27,633
Come

542
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,664
Lord Hsi-men, Mrs. Hsi-men

543
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:30,667
Good bye

544
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:31,634
Take this

545
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,989
This is a real doctor

546
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,455
You have a new target

547
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:53,253
I've played many women

548
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,525
But I've never touched a female doctor

549
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:01,402
Coming

550
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:11,508
Brother

551
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:12,411
I am back

552
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,314
Hui-lan, did you see Hsi-men Ching

553
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:20,816
Yes, I did

554
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,419
Is he doubting you

555
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,665
I did everything the way you taught me

556
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,399
Not just he didn’t doubt me

557
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,267
He said I am a good doctor

558
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,340
He will fall into our trap

559
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:42,208
Hsi-men is a really ruthless guy

560
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:43,739
He will do anything

561
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,914
I don't think you should take this risk

562
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:48,280
Brother

563
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,453
Other then this

564
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:54,216
You tell me
how can we deal with this guy

565
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,049
Do we have to give up

566
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,258
If he found out you are not for real

567
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:06,836
The cruel way
he treats women is very famous

568
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:11,371
Beside,
you have to lose your chastity for me

569
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,467
Does it worth it?

570
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:17,143
Your face, brother

571
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:20,215
Was burnt by that guy

572
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,486
He ruined your life

573
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,650
No matter how much I sacrifice

574
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,621
I want him to pay back

575
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:34,731
Hui-lan, I... I am worried

576
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,990
Brother, don't say it any more

577
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:40,133
I have made my mind

578
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:44,607
Have you got everything I need

579
00:40:46,844 --> 00:40:48,334
This is a scab of the death sore

580
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,079
It's from a dead body

581
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:53,072
make it into powder

582
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:56,445
Leave it on Hsi-men's wound

583
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,885
If it contacts blood

584
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,989
Hsi-men will get the sore in three days

585
00:41:05,362 --> 00:41:06,193
But you have to be careful

586
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:08,025
Don't touch it yourself

587
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,700
There are no cure for it

588
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:15,070
Hsi-men Ching

589
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,877
I want you to suffer

590
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:29,869
Who is it?

591
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:31,035
It me, Chen Ching-chi

592
00:43:40,517 --> 00:43:42,246
Chin-chi, you are back

593
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:42,946
Fifth Lady

594
00:43:49,893 --> 00:43:50,826
Have you met my uncle

595
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:51,523
Yes

596
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,788
How was he

597
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:57,033
He looks health

598
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,802
But he looks a little stupid

599
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:02,028
Like a idiot

600
00:44:02,606 --> 00:44:05,200
All he know is eat the cakes
you made him

601
00:44:05,843 --> 00:44:07,242
Like he has starved for a long time

602
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:13,711
But,
I thought I saw tears in his eyes

603
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:16,948
Chin-chi

604
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:19,656
Did you tell him what I want to say

605
00:44:20,624 --> 00:44:21,557
I told everything

606
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,418
I even said it twice

607
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,328
Told me not to come back

608
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:31,363
Good, he should never come back

609
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,831
Never

610
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:35,334
Fifth Lady

611
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:37,864
Don't be sad

612
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:40,838
He is a clumsy guy

613
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:44,710
He doesn't understand your heart

614
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,912
Don't be sad, because

615
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:51,718
Chen Ching-chi

616
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,458
Fifth Lady, this is not our first time

617
00:44:56,393 --> 00:44:57,758
Don't pretend

618
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:00,827
This is the only time and the last time

619
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:02,696
I won't promise you another

620
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,133
Fifth Lady...

621
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:06,396
I go every where for you

622
00:45:07,438 --> 00:45:08,428
You have to thank me

623
00:45:09,506 --> 00:45:10,473
No, no matter what you say

624
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:13,139
Fifth Lady, pity me

625
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:14,440
I think ill of you

626
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,445
Let me go...

627
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:20,879
Chen Chin-chi, let go of me

628
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:23,348
Move

629
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:24,950
Chen Ching-chi

630
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,983
Golden Lotus

631
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:34,963
Chen Ching-chi

632
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,097
Don't forget I rescue you ones

633
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:37,693
Come

634
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:38,430
OK

635
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,433
Chen Ching-chi

636
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:42,600
You are crazy

637
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,335
Don't pull me.
Let her go, Chen Ching-chi

638
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:49,507
Chen Ching-chi, what are you doing

639
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,180
Father-in-law, I...

640
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,381
Master, he is harassing me...

641
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,816
If it's not for Fifth Lady...

642
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:05,227
Bastard, loser, get out of here

643
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:06,156
Yes

644
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:15,632
Master, her is like a maniac

645
00:46:19,843 --> 00:46:22,972
Men gets crazy when they need women

646
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,705
Haven't you see those dogs on heat?

647
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,685
If female dogs don't let them,
they get crazy

648
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,288
Master, I am so scared

649
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:33,420
You're still talking

650
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:39,026
That loser is pretty pitiful actually

651
00:46:39,897 --> 00:46:42,525
I say you should satisfy him, Plum Blossom

652
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:47,836
No, I am yours, how can I do that?

653
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:50,940
You are loyal to me

654
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:53,302
By the way

655
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:56,669
I need you guys to do me a favor

656
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,377
Master, why are you so polite

657
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:01,244
It's this

658
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,420
My health has a little problem

659
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,050
I need a total treatment

660
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,087
But it's inconvenient at First Lady's place

661
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:13,093
So I want to come here

662
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,395
You can do anything at home

663
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,299
What's so in convenient?

664
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,569
You liked that doctor

665
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,741
So you want to do it here

666
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:29,971
You are quick

667
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,317
You all understand me?

668
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:37,879
Master, don't worry, we know what to do

669
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:38,715
Plum Blossom

670
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,156
Bring her here tomorrow then

671
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,027
You have to act well

672
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,423
I shall leave now

673
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:52,166
And have a good sleep

674
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,837
So I can handle that doctor tomorrow

675
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:06,345
Plum Blossom

676
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,519
How can we help Hsi-men do this?

677
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,419
You over did it

678
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:13,352
Fifth Lady, don't angry

679
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:18,289
I am not helping Hsi-men actually

680
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:20,463
What?

681
00:48:21,498 --> 00:48:22,522
Just what and see

682
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:28,795
He will get his deserved fate

683
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:41,513
Hsi-men

684
00:48:43,153 --> 00:48:44,450
See how I am going treat you

685
00:48:53,530 --> 00:48:53,792
Brother

686
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:59,293
Hui-lan, you have
to be careful not to touch that stuff

687
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:00,201
Understand

688
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,466
Don't worry, I remember

689
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:11,439
I'm leaving, brother

690
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:12,144
OK

691
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:16,509
Don't come out

692
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,167
Lord Hsi-men's house is big

693
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:42,470
So what?

694
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,580
It only makes people feel lonely

695
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,511
Lord Hsi-men. you aren't joking

696
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:50,516
You have four or five wives, you sill lonely?

697
00:49:52,189 --> 00:49:53,486
It's not this

698
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:55,491
There are enough people

699
00:49:56,426 --> 00:50:00,954
But we don’t have someone like you

700
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,693
It's too bad

701
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:05,030
You are joking again, lord Hsi-men

702
00:50:06,803 --> 00:50:07,099
Please

703
00:50:17,981 --> 00:50:18,209
Come

704
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:21,208
this is fifth Lady's room

705
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,877
It's so neat

706
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,048
Where is Fifth Lady

707
00:50:28,091 --> 00:50:30,116
She went to the temple

708
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,521
I thought she wants me to take a look too

709
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,967
That was an excuse

710
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:40,897
I wanted you to come

711
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:44,934
I want to teach me the special treatment

712
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:47,309
You liar

713
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:54,617
You said to learn the treatment,
you need a quiet and clean place

714
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:58,054
Isn't this place quiet and clean

715
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,322
This place is good enough

716
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:06,891
but it the person who
needs it the most, can you do it

717
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:08,157
I can

718
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,030
No problem

719
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:14,302
This treatment is a kind of inner strength

720
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:18,474
we have to be naked with no other thoughts

721
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,343
Can you do it?

722
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:24,941
I look like a playboy,
but actually I am a nice guy

723
00:51:25,715 --> 00:51:29,618
I won't have any other thoughts towards you

724
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:31,410
Good

725
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:34,653
I will teach you the treatment here

726
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,490
Thanks

727
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:40,224
Let's take our clothes off

728
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,028
Remember, no other thoughts

729
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,636
Of course, I understand

730
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:29,504
You...don't, lord

731
00:52:29,946 --> 00:52:32,540
Doctor, I am in trouble, help me

732
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:33,580
No...

733
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,824
Lord, you are great

734
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,725
You almost killed me

735
00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,563
I never knew you are so wild

736
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,204
See

737
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:15,640
It looks like I tattooed my back

738
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:27,153
It's bleeding, how?

739
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:29,654
Turn over

740
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,022
I have some medicine

741
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,925
Let me put some on you

742
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:36,962
No need, it's just a scratch

743
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,125
This medicine is very helpful

744
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:42,568
There will be no scars

745
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:51,841
Don you feel better now?

746
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,346
Better

747
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,281
But it's itchy

748
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,048
I scratched you too

749
00:56:03,626 --> 00:56:05,355
Here, let me put some on you

750
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,691
No...No need...Don't move

751
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:08,591
No...

752
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,584
Hui-lan, you are back

753
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:38,426
Some thing wrong?

754
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:42,896
My scratch...

755
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,461
Some powder got on it...

756
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:50,703
How come you are so careless

757
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:53,365
I told you before

758
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,072
This kind of death sore

759
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:58,106
Is very poisonous

760
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,146
It won't let you die

761
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,877
But it will make you suffer your whole life

762
00:57:05,054 --> 00:57:05,714
Stop it

763
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:10,389
So what

764
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:14,262
If 1 die with Hsi-men Ching

765
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:19,161
Brother

766
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:22,668
Is there a cure

767
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,275
Rub your whole body with grapefruit leaves

768
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,172
If nothing happens in three days,
you will be alright

769
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:35,745
Whole body

770
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,041
Lord, I dream a dream

771
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,110
I dream about a little boy
in red ran into my stomach

772
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,082
It scared me

773
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:45,585
I am thinking

774
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:47,315
The baby

775
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,251
Will look like Buddha's servant

776
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,225
Looks like this baby will be special

777
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:57,631
Lord

778
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,540
Are you listening to me, it's almost noon

779
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:05,933
I don't feel well

780
00:59:09,145 --> 00:59:11,637
There are so many mosquitoes

781
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,439
So itch

782
00:59:16,519 --> 00:59:17,748
Lord, what happened to your face?

783
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,147
What about it?

784
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:25,187
I hate it

785
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,587
Tell Hui-lan to come here

786
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:29,625
See what's wrong with me

787
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:36,465
Master

788
00:59:37,574 --> 00:59:37,904
Doctor Chen is here

789
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:38,804
Lord Hsi-men

790
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:44,045
I told you to get Hui-lan, you didn't hear me?

791
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,405
Master, she is not home

792
00:59:46,716 --> 00:59:47,945
No one knows where she is

793
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:49,108
Female doctor

794
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,116
We have a female doctor is this county?

795
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:52,016
Yes

796
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,020
From Lo-yang

797
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:55,386
You never heard?

798
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:57,054
No

799
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:58,719
don't care about her now

800
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:00,362
Look at me first

801
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:03,794
What are this things on my face?

802
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:04,927
It's so itchy

803
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:08,560
Please have a seat

804
01:00:09,005 --> 01:00:09,233
Thank you

805
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:21,777
Lord Hsi-men

806
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,342
Have you been to any place lately

807
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:25,847
No

808
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:28,757
Strange

809
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:33,693
It looks like smallpox, but it isn't

810
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:36,788
In the past few years

811
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,794
Smallpox has never appear in this county

812
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,629
What, I got smallpox?

813
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:44,968
This...
 am not sure

814
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,105
But it could be

815
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:48,505
Damn you

816
01:00:50,279 --> 01:00:51,405
You didn't say anything yet

817
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:54,939
Is it a big deal, doctor?

818
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:57,819
Madam, to tell you the truth

819
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,583
If this is smallpox,
you might just become pockmarked face

820
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:05,555
But I haven't seen anything like this

821
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:10,194
Let me go home and check, and come back late

822
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,434
You are saying this
disease is worse then smallpox?

823
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:17,398
It might be what my teacher told me before...

824
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:17,965
Bastard

825
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,711
Don't think I will give
you more money by scaring me

826
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:24,572
Get lost...

827
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,277
I don't want to see you ever

828
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:27,042
Yes

829
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:29,447
Get em Hui-lan

830
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:32,988
Didn’t Yin just said she is not here

831
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:34,885
She can't go far

832
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:36,281
Go find her

833
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,258
If you can't find her, I will kill you

834
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:38,921
Yes

835
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,295
Why this?

836
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:46,263
Bastard

837
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,933
Is this ghost that did this?

838
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:03,181
Brother

839
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:07,381
Hui-lan

840
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:08,218
Brother

841
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:10,120
Hui-lan. Brother

842
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:10,586
Hui-lan...what happened

843
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:12,520
Brother

844
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:15,898
It looks like I've got the death sore

845
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,267
I told you don't deal with Hsi-men

846
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,706
He is a living monster

847
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:27,971
I don't regret it

848
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:30,971
Even if I die with him

849
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:35,415
I won't regret

850
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:36,946
Hui-lan

851
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:41,319
I heard Hsi-men is looking for you

852
01:02:42,792 --> 01:02:44,191
Before he found out everything

853
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,286
Leave This place

854
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:49,760
If he found out, we will die

855
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:50,925
No

856
01:02:52,034 --> 01:02:54,366
I got this disease

857
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:57,863
I have nothing to be afraid of

858
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:00,471
Hui-lan

859
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:03,707
This is not a deadly disease

860
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,414
I will find a cure

861
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,578
Leave with me

862
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:13,678
Brother, don’t lie anymore

863
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:17,858
This is a deadly disease

864
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:21,925
When you are sick, you feel itchy everywhere

865
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:23,632
Itch till the bone

866
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,392
Death is a better treatment

867
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:31,136
Or I won't use it on Hsi-men

868
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:32,167
Hui-lan

869
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,005
A worthful death is
better than a worthless life

870
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,874
Leave will have a better chance of surviving

871
01:03:38,381 --> 01:03:39,542
Let's leave

872
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:43,548
OK

873
01:03:46,622 --> 01:03:49,284
Can you leave me for a moment

874
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,291
I want to change

875
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:54,152
No I still look good

876
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:58,352
But I will be ugly in two days

877
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:19,741
Hui-lan

878
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:21,910
Hui-lan

879
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:28,649
Hui-lan

880
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:30,219
Hui-lan

881
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:31,453
Hui-lan

882
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,055
Hui-lan

883
01:05:40,736 --> 01:05:40,895
Hui-lan

884
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:42,300
Hui-lan

885
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:47,269
Hsi-men Ching

886
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:51,539
Master

887
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:53,211
Bad news

888
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:55,807
What?

889
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:56,810
We found Hui-lan

890
01:05:57,253 --> 01:05:57,879
But she is dead

891
01:05:58,454 --> 01:05:58,716
Dead?

892
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:00,554
How?

893
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:01,421
Suicide

894
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:03,488
And died in Jung's house

895
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:05,686
People said she is Jung's sister

896
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:08,793
Even if she is Jung's sister

897
01:06:09,432 --> 01:06:10,297
She doesn't have to commit suicide

898
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,062
Unless...

899
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,894
Master, doctor Chen is here

900
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:17,931
Lord Hsi-men

901
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,974
I found it

902
01:06:22,378 --> 01:06:22,571
Found it?

903
01:06:23,379 --> 01:06:25,245
The disease

904
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:26,281
So?

905
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:28,575
This is called Death Sore

906
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,348
This is a rare disease

907
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,047
Deadly

908
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:34,790
No, it's not

909
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:36,484
But it's worse then death

910
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,985
It makes you itchy everywhere

911
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:43,355
Even inside you

912
01:06:43,899 --> 01:06:47,426
People who can't stand it scratch
themselves till blood comes out

913
01:06:47,970 --> 01:06:48,198
Sometimes get crazy

914
01:06:49,438 --> 01:06:50,599
Any cure?

915
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:53,638
No

916
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:58,106
People who got it, eight out of ten dies

917
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:00,845
Why do you tell me this?

918
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,578
Let's do some studying

919
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,945
Study my ass, you are joking me

920
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:12,351
The did this to me

921
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:13,790
Jung

922
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:16,591
When I got you, I will chop you into pieces

923
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:17,495
Man

924
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:18,393
Master

925
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:19,729
Tell this to everyone

926
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,465
Who every catches Jung
gets one thousand dollars reward

927
01:07:23,406 --> 01:07:25,773
That blind man can't go far

928
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:27,436
Yes, master

929
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:40,512
Jung

930
01:07:41,323 --> 01:07:41,482
Fifth Lady...

931
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,226
Why are you here

932
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:51,531
Do you know Hsi-men Ching is looking for you?

933
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:52,630
Yes

934
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,260
This is why I hide here

935
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,563
They will never know

936
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,266
I hide at Hsi-men's home

937
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,205
What are your plans

938
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:06,916
We'll see

939
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:10,549
When they don't want me that bad,
I will get away

940
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,013
Fifth Lady

941
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,785
Can you find a hideout for me?

942
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:16,825
Let me see...

943
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:18,991
Fifth Lady, don't worry

944
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:21,125
I won't get you in trouble

945
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:25,197
I know you hate Hsi-men too

946
01:08:25,668 --> 01:08:27,898
We are on the same team

947
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:31,367
Fifth Lady, pity me

948
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:32,965
Spare my life

949
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:38,940
OK, Jung, come with me

950
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:41,810
Come

951
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,729
Please hide in this well

952
01:08:58,567 --> 01:09:00,092
I will give you something to eat everyday

953
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:03,237
When everything is OK, you can come out

954
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:09,141
Fifth Lady, thank you, you will get good luck

955
01:09:24,927 --> 01:09:25,655
So itchy

956
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:26,321
Lord

957
01:09:26,862 --> 01:09:27,328
Itchy

958
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:28,863
Lord, hold it in

959
01:09:29,365 --> 01:09:29,627
Give it to me

960
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,031
Let me suck on it more. No, lord

961
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:32,560
You suck on it seven times today

962
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:34,364
Doctor said you cant suck on it too much

963
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:35,937
Or you will harm yourself

964
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:39,406
Shut up, give it to me, hurry

965
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:34,589
Wine

966
01:10:42,571 --> 01:10:42,730
Good...

967
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:48,239
You are the hero Wu-Song

968
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,174
Never let go of any good wine

969
01:10:51,547 --> 01:10:52,605
Brother, Mrs.Sun

970
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,747
I received the letter from Liang-San

971
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:59,448
We heard you were in trouble
but you got away with it

972
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,790
We prepared some wine when we got the news

973
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:05,821
Thank you

974
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,663
what do you want to do from now on, brother

975
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,659
I am going to Ching-he County

976
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,035
Brother Wu

977
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:22,235
You have no relative there, why go back?

978
01:11:22,911 --> 01:11:24,345
Come to Laing San with me

979
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,507
Everyone at Liang San misses you

980
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:49,597
Master

981
01:11:54,443 --> 01:11:55,774
Congratulations, master

982
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:58,239
Sixth Lady gave birth

983
01:11:58,747 --> 01:11:58,872
Really?

984
01:11:59,515 --> 01:11:59,640
Really

985
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:00,607
A boy or a girl

986
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:01,575
Master, it's a boy

987
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:07,714
Excellent

988
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:09,650
Excellent

989
01:12:17,433 --> 01:12:19,925
Vase, where is my son

990
01:12:21,937 --> 01:12:23,427
Where is my son. Here, my lord

991
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:26,101
It looks exactly like you

992
01:12:32,548 --> 01:12:33,174
So cute

993
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,442
Don't touch him, lord

994
01:12:40,556 --> 01:12:42,820
You are sick, lord

995
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:46,421
OK, I won't touch him

996
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,088
I can look at him, right

997
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,158
Leave some distance

998
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:55,067
OK

999
01:12:57,306 --> 01:12:59,570
He looks like me

1000
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:02,205
Of course

1001
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:03,837
If he doesn't look like you, who else

1002
01:13:04,813 --> 01:13:04,972
Yea

1003
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:10,151
I won't be afraid of nothing since I have him

1004
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:12,913
I could die peacefully

1005
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:18,185
He is a boy

1006
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:23,156
Who dares say Hsi-men family
will get bad fate from now on

1007
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:27,663
Who dares say I won't have a son

1008
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:33,671
Lord, he doesn't have a name yet

1009
01:13:37,646 --> 01:13:38,977
I came up with lots of names

1010
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,380
Non of it fits

1011
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:43,948
But this is no problem

1012
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,418
When he is one month old

1013
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:49,324
I will invite all the smart people here

1014
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:51,954
Everyone

1015
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:56,298
Let them pick a nice name for my son

1016
01:13:58,700 --> 01:13:58,962
Congratulations

1017
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:01,763
Thanks

1018
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:17,113
First Lady, look at it

1019
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:19,819
Look how cocky Vase is

1020
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,979
She though she is the First Lady

1021
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:26,689
It's OK, let her be happy for one night

1022
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:27,022
Right

1023
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:29,224
We can fix her some other chance

1024
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,266
Hsi-men Ching won't live long

1025
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:43,870
See how cocky she can be

1026
01:14:44,613 --> 01:14:45,580
Forget about it, Plum Blossom

1027
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:48,473
We are all unfortunate people, why blame him

1028
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,045
You forgot everything

1029
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:51,647
You forgot it

1030
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,418
She treated you so bad these days

1031
01:14:59,461 --> 01:14:59,689
Master Hsi-men

1032
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,262
The whole Ching-he County is happy

1033
01:15:05,801 --> 01:15:06,461
Why?

1034
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:08,862
It's easy

1035
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:13,173
We haven't had a honored
person for a long time

1036
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:14,741
According to my calculation

1037
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,011
Your son was born at a perfect time

1038
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:21,772
This county will be famous

1039
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:25,250
Our hopes are on your son

1040
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:27,751
Really?

1041
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:28,456
Of course

1042
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:30,548
Master Hsi-men

1043
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:33,227
Though I haven't met your son yet

1044
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:34,691
But I bet

1045
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:40,767
He must be really handsome

1046
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:44,663
You are joking,
you haven't even seen the kid yet

1047
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,469
Just look at his daddy and mommy

1048
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:54,649
Handsome parents have handsome kids

1049
01:15:55,417 --> 01:15:55,645
Right

1050
01:15:57,886 --> 01:15:58,284
By the way

1051
01:15:58,754 --> 01:16:00,620
Where is your son?

1052
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:04,484
He is drinking milk,
when he is full, he will come out

1053
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:05,555
Right

1054
01:16:06,295 --> 01:16:09,731
Please have some tea inside

1055
01:16:10,065 --> 01:16:11,260
I have some other guests. Sure...go ahead

1056
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:12,228
Please...

1057
01:16:13,702 --> 01:16:14,032
Go in first

1058
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:15,499
Inside...

1059
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:16,764
Please go inside

1060
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,202
Master, and Sixth Lady

1061
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:20,036
Bad news

1062
01:16:20,776 --> 01:16:20,935
What?

1063
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:23,634
When the nurse wants to feed young master

1064
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:25,970
A man took young master away

1065
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:27,677
Where did they go

1066
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,316
In the garden

1067
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:31,078
Son of a bitch

1068
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:33,979
Man

1069
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,155
come with me

1070
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,858
Move it

1071
01:16:53,008 --> 01:16:53,270
Don't rush

1072
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:56,340
Slow down

1073
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,144
I won't run

1074
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,176
I was waiting

1075
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:02,181
Jung

1076
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:03,211
It's me

1077
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:04,819
Hsi-men Ching

1078
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:07,422
I am here to congratulate you

1079
01:17:10,058 --> 01:17:11,389
Men, arrest him

1080
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:12,021
Yes

1081
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:12,987
Who dares to come forward

1082
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,592
I will throw the kid down, back off

1083
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:19,861
Jung

1084
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:21,498
Don't do it

1085
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,435
We can talk

1086
01:17:25,774 --> 01:17:28,072
Jung, I did something bad to you

1087
01:17:28,377 --> 01:17:30,846
But this kid knows nothing

1088
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,607
Don't kill him

1089
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:35,941
Vase, you are right

1090
01:17:36,785 --> 01:17:38,310
Your kid did nothing wrong

1091
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:40,816
But what did Wu-Da do wrong?

1092
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:43,351
What did I do wrong?

1093
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:44,754
Besides

1094
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:48,458
People who die because of Hsi-men

1095
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:49,697
What did they do wrong?

1096
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,860
They don't even know why they die

1097
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:53,627
Jung

1098
01:17:54,269 --> 01:17:55,259
It's us adult's fault

1099
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,197
You want to revenge, revenge on us

1100
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,508
Give the kid back, please

1101
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,005
Jung

1102
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:02,706
If you let the kid go

1103
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:04,144
I won't do anything to you

1104
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,443
I will give you money to open a new store

1105
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:13,147
Hsi-men Ching

1106
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:16,947
I am not a three years old kid

1107
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:23,363
I came here today

1108
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,565
Never thought of going out alive

1109
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:32,036
I want to see you get your fate

1110
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:34,406
I don't care if I die

1111
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:36,912
Jung, please

1112
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,112
Don't revenge on my kid

1113
01:18:39,715 --> 01:18:41,410
You can hit me

1114
01:18:43,952 --> 01:18:45,078
You can kill me

1115
01:18:46,421 --> 01:18:49,152
But don't harm my kid, please

1116
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:49,684
No need to kneel down

1117
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:52,525
I am not here for you

1118
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:54,829
Lord, you kneel down too

1119
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:56,726
Lord

1120
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:07,204
Jung

1121
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,211
No all the family member
is kneeling right in front of you

1122
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:12,971
Please let go of him

1123
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:13,845
Hsi-men Ching

1124
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:18,583
I won't let you go this easy

1125
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,288
Unless I get my revenge

1126
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:25,125
Or I won't give you back your kid

1127
01:19:26,728 --> 01:19:26,990
Good

1128
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,258
What do you want me to do

1129
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,293
No I want to tell everyone

1130
01:19:33,835 --> 01:19:35,325
What you have done in the past years

1131
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,671
If you lie

1132
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,371
I will throw the kid down

1133
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:44,645
Don't. don't, don't...

1134
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:46,706
Then tell him to speak

1135
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:49,746
Lord, speak, hurry

1136
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:50,414
OK, I speak

1137
01:19:52,420 --> 01:19:53,216
Listen

1138
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,583
I

1139
01:19:56,191 --> 01:19:56,987
Have a bad temper

1140
01:19:58,426 --> 01:19:59,393
I swear everyone

1141
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:01,955
I hit everyone

1142
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:05,298
Sometimes I see beautiful women

1143
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:07,158
I will look at her

1144
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:07,999
Hsi-men Chine

1145
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:10,668
I think you don't want your son to live

1146
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:12,337
Don't...

1147
01:20:14,509 --> 01:20:15,601
I want to start from small stuffs

1148
01:20:17,012 --> 01:20:18,275
But you are so impatient

1149
01:20:19,447 --> 01:20:20,539
Then I will start from the big events

1150
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:24,408
I took Wong’s land

1151
01:20:26,121 --> 01:20:27,316
Burnt his house

1152
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,986
I raped Ho's wife

1153
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:35,290
And I said she seduced me

1154
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:36,263
She...

1155
01:20:37,365 --> 01:20:39,163
She killed herself

1156
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:42,564
I bribed the government

1157
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:45,139
Import wine

1158
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:47,570
Sell fake medicine

1159
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,372
I killed a lot...

1160
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:54,382
Let me ask you, Hsi-men

1161
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:57,651
Did you killed Hua

1162
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:01,912
Yes...

1163
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:05,221
Say it

1164
01:21:07,162 --> 01:21:07,458
Yes

1165
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:09,488
Wu-Da

1166
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:12,361
Did you poisoned him?

1167
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:18,237
You wants his wife

1168
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,433
So you poisoned him

1169
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,066
And lied

1170
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:25,643
Let Wu-Song take the blame

1171
01:21:26,982 --> 01:21:27,778
Hsi-men Ching

1172
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:30,416
Don't think no one can do anything to you

1173
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:32,945
You better die early

1174
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:37,052
So when Wu-Song Comes back,
you won't die in his hands

1175
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:40,625
Enough

1176
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:43,325
Jung, I had enough of you

1177
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,024
Stop or I won't be polite to you

1178
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:48,162
Good, let's see what you can do

1179
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:51,238
You dare, I will kill you

1180
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:55,808
Son...

1181
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:06,209
Son...

1182
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:08,385
Son...

1183
01:22:17,565 --> 01:22:18,327
Hsi-men Ching

1184
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,226
No that you don't have a son

1185
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:26,673
I just want to see you get your desired fate

1186
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:28,437
I see it now

1187
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,342
I can die

1188
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:48,289
Jung

1189
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:54,598
You bastard

1190
01:22:56,137 --> 01:22:57,104
Give back my son

1191
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:06,270
Give back my son, you bastard

1192
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:08,705
Son...

1193
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:19,590
Give back my son, give if back

1194
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:25,165
Bastard, give back my son

1195
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:42,780
Lord

1196
01:23:43,718 --> 01:23:44,378
Bastard

1197
01:23:46,755 --> 01:23:47,085
Give back my son

1198
01:23:47,989 --> 01:23:48,353
Lord

1199
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:49,285
Lord...Sixth Lady

1200
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:50,555
Lord...Sixth Lady

1201
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:03,370
Hsi-men Ching, give back my life

1202
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:39,768
Give back my life

1203
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,576
His-men Ching

1204
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:58,053
Give back my life...

1205
01:25:14,542 --> 01:25:15,532
Give back my life...

1206
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:22,307
Give back my life...

1207
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:28,254
Give back my life...

1208
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,226
Lord, you are dreaming, take some medicine

1209
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:34,655
I won't drink it

1210
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:36,695
There must be poison in it

1211
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:37,997
You want to drug me

1212
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,128
Lord, who dares to drug you

1213
01:25:41,703 --> 01:25:44,035
When I was sleeping, I heard you said

1214
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,002
I heard someone wants to kill me

1215
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:47,433
And eat me

1216
01:25:47,876 --> 01:25:49,435
Master, Mistress, here come Second Uncle

1217
01:25:49,844 --> 01:25:50,777
Let him in. Get lost

1218
01:25:53,748 --> 01:25:54,146
Lord

1219
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:55,643
Why is he here this moment

1220
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:56,780
He comes here this time

1221
01:25:57,252 --> 01:25:58,515
He want to eat me too

1222
01:25:59,154 --> 01:26:00,519
Lord, stop the nonsense

1223
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:02,350
He is here to see you

1224
01:26:03,258 --> 01:26:04,384
You people aren't this good

1225
01:26:05,426 --> 01:26:06,518
I am not stupid

1226
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,123
I rather feed myself to the dogs then you

1227
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:09,959
Lord

1228
01:26:12,433 --> 01:26:13,525
Brother-in-law, where are you

1229
01:26:17,438 --> 01:26:19,736
What's wrong with he, sister

1230
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,201
He...he is crazy

1231
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:25,274
Sister

1232
01:26:25,813 --> 01:26:26,905
You are his first wife

1233
01:26:27,282 --> 01:26:29,273
This is your house from now on

1234
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:31,943
But be careful of betrayal

1235
01:26:32,554 --> 01:26:33,578
Because when he dies

1236
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:37,314
People would want his property

1237
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:40,290
So I want you do give me some ideas

1238
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,456
Sister, you are right

1239
01:26:44,098 --> 01:26:47,295
Don't worry, I know what to do
