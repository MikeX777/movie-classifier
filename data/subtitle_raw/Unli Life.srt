00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,118
I see. Can I get an autograph?

541
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,828
Idol! Can I get an autograph?

542
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,040
That's what happened to me?

543
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,334
[stutters] But Sir Saro,

544
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,086
what you were saying is true.

545
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,963
I have been to different eras!

546
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,548
But how did I get back here?

547
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:49,676
You restarted.

548
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,220
Restart? How? Like a video game?

549
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,471
Exactly!

550
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,807
When you die,

551
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,976
you will go to a different era.

552
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,729
If you couldn't complete your mission,
you will come back to the bar.

553
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,940
What? Why did you just tell me now?

554
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:07,527
I was supposed to tell you,
but you already drank the Wishkey.

555
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,655
But why do I need to go
to different times?

556
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:14,450
Why can't I just go back to the time
when Victoria and I broke up?

557
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,831
Because now that you started this,

558
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:27,880
only the Wishkey knows
where it's power will take you.

559
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,092
What? So it means I have to go
to a lot of different eras?

560
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,177
Now you know!

561
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,054
Oh, come on!

563
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,851
-Sir Saro!
-Huh?

564
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,394
Why does Joey Marquez have a bottle?

565
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,104
-Where?
-There!

566
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,440
I already broke that one!

-Bela?

572
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,678
Why are you here? Where's Dad?

573
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,221
Who's Bela?

574
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:21,100
I am not Bela. I am Gregoria.

575
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,811
And you. Who are you?

576
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,481
I am… Hua Ze Lei.

577
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:30,318
-Hua Ze Lei?
-What-che-lei-lei. What-che-lei.

578
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,946
I can't understand you.

579
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,074
Fix it.

580
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,701
How are you?

581
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,453
Victoria!

582
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,998
-I am not Victoria.
-I am Maria.

583
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,626
Excuse me.

584
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,712
Maria.

585
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,884
You need to know something about me,
why I am here.

586
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,555
What do you want?

587
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,226
It's because I'm not from here.

588
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:07,438
I came from a different time,
and I have a mission.

589
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,608
Because of you, Victoria. I mean, Maria.

590
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,151
You're not from here?

591
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,195
-Are you a spy?
-No!

592
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,949
No, in fact, I love our country.

593
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,493
Um… um…

594
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,579
I am here because you need to love me.

595
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,334
If you're not a spy,

596
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,546
then you're probably crazy.

597
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,340
Yes. I am crazy about you.

598
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,092
Really, now.

599
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,429
If you're telling the truth
and you are not a spy,

600
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,849
prove it in our attack later.

601
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,519

Um…

604
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,443

-Don’t you know him?
-No.

608
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,959
He is the Supremo.

609
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:12,879
Supremo?

610
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,591
Why does Richard Gutierrez
look different in person.

611
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,844
Don’t you know the Supremo?

612
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,179
I said I don't.

613
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:24,473
Supremo is Andres Bonifacio.

614
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,351
Andres Bonifacio!

Later, our attack is set

623
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:07,516
to ambush the civil guards
who will cross Balintawak.

624
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:16,442
We will meet there
the group of Berting, from Hagonoy.

625
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,153

01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,397
You slept in the middle of my stories.

1082
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:57,940
There’s still so much beer.

1083
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,860
-[glass clinking]
-What did you say?

1084
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:02,612
We are best friends?

1085
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:04,614
Yes, we are best friends.

1086
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,117
You forgot because you drank too much.

1087
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,785
Wait, I'll order more.

1088
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,247
Excuse me.

1089
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:20,546
[sighs]

1090
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:24,300
Sorry about that, bestie.

1091
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,219
Maybe I was just drunk.

1092
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,680
-Cheers!
-[man] Cheers!

1093
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:31,933
You're so amazing!

1094
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:33,976
What is that?

1095
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,979
-I mean, the singer, amazing.
-[clapping]

1096
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,023
You're right.

1097
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,026
Hey!

1098
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,570
-Hypebeast.
-Hypebeast?

1099
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:47,156
What do you mean?

1100
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,449
What I mean is,

1101
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,493
hype, peace, man!

1102
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,661
[laughing]

1103
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:54,497
I knew I would find you there.

1104
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,625
I know you so well.

1105
01:03:58,543 --> 01:03:59,961
What is bothering you?

1106
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:01,546
Me?

1107
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,967
That’s all right.

1108
01:04:06,926 --> 01:04:07,969
I’m on your side.

1109
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:12,598
Because, if not for you,
I wouldn't get a girlfriend.

1110
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:17,436
You have a girlfriend?

1111
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,146
[coughing]

1112
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,983
Dude, what have you been drinking?

1113
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:24,026
Yes, I have.

1114
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:26,487
Come on. Let's go inside.

1115
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,614
Why did you bring him here?

1116
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,075
[in English] Sorry.

1117
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,286
He got so drunk. That's why I brought him.

1118
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:36,622
You should have let him
crawl home by himself.

1119
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,125
I can't do that to him, sweetheart.

1120
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:40,877
[retching]

1121
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:42,837
You’re sweethearts?

1122
01:04:45,464 --> 01:04:49,635
Dude, go inside and have some coffee
so you can sober up.

1123
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:50,678
But…

1124
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,264
Careful, you drank too much.

1125
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:54,849
[sighs]

1126
01:04:56,392 --> 01:04:58,978
[light music playing]

1127
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,449
Do you want some water?

1128
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,077
-Yes.
-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1129
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,937
Uh… Victoria, can we talk?

1130
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:43,272
Who’s Victoria?

1131
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:46,108
Vicky! Water!

1132
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,655
Victoria, the girl from the bar.
She looks just like you.

1133
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:52,740
Vicky.

1134
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,992
What have I done to you?

1135
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:57,078
You don't know, Ben?

1136
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,873
If I knew, I wouldn't be asking you now.

1137
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,085
You know what? If you don't know,
then don't bother asking.

1138
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,169
Know what?

1139
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:08,631
The thing you said that you don't know!
[sigh]

1140
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:11,300
[Benedict] Why don't you just tell me
what you know,

1141
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,427
so that I will know it also?

1142
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:14,887
Right?

1143
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,226
I don't care if you don’t know
what I know.

1144
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:23,562
But Vicky…

1145
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:33,990
I put salt, didn’t I?

1146
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,534
Yes, I like my coffee salty.

1147
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:40,955
Tastes like the sea!

1148
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:44,792
[man] Dude, I have a favor
to ask from you.

1149
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,752
[man] You're my best friend, right?

1150
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,004
What is it?

1151
01:06:49,213 --> 01:06:52,133
-[man] Help me take Vicky away.
-[clacking]

1152
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,970
What? You're eloping with Vicky?

1153
01:06:56,804 --> 01:06:57,805
Yes!

1154
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:02,268
Dude, you know that her parents
disapprove of me.

1155
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,272
[sighs] And we planned this
a long time ago.

1156
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,608
But I cannot do it alone.

1157
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,445
That's why I need your help.

1158
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,406
[sighs] But…

1159
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:17,992
Dude, not that way.

1160
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,494
Eloping is a different matter.

1161
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:22,747
Dude.

1162
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,458
Are you going to bail on me now?

1163
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,419
You even agreed on the previous favor
I asked of you.

1164
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,337
What previous favor?

1165
01:07:30,421 --> 01:07:31,672
To date Vicky.

1166
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,424
[man] When you broke up with her.

1167
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:36,469
-I said that?
-Yes.

1168
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,221
You told me you don't like her anymore.

1169
01:07:39,305 --> 01:07:42,391
And remember, you owe me a lot as well.

1170
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,479
[ball clacking]

1171
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,773
I'm very sorry, friends.

1172
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:55,946
-[tense music playing]
-Did you who shoot this?

1173
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,282
[man] We've been trying to do that
for three hours,

1174
01:07:58,365 --> 01:08:01,243
and you just shoot it that easily?
And from the other table?

1175
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,330
But Pacquito, he is good.

1176
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:07,583
Stop it, Rez!

1177
01:08:11,462 --> 01:08:14,340
Do you want me to crush this
in front of you? Huh?

1178
01:08:16,634 --> 01:08:18,511
Bomber. Do it.

1179
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,933
[grunting]

1180
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:24,975
Let me do it.

1181
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:27,937
[squeaking]

1182
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:30,481
It's Bata! It's Bata!

1183
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:31,690
Bata?

1184
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,027
-[crowd cheering]
-[Benedict] Right. It's really Bata.

1185
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,237
Who’s Bata?

1186
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:38,572
Ben, I'll go ahead. I need to see Vicky.

1187
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,283
-All right!
-[man] Bata!

1188
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:42,952
[Benedict] He has a mustache?

1189
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,078
Bata?

1190
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:59,969
[panting]

1191
01:09:00,928 --> 01:09:02,721
Vicky! Vicky!

1192
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,849
-[girl]What is that!
-Oh my!

1193
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,017
Grandma, is Vicky around?

1194
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,437
Kristina!

1195
01:09:11,021 --> 01:09:13,440
Why are you wearing my clothes again?

1196
01:09:13,524 --> 01:09:15,317
I just tried it on. What’s wrong?

1197
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:18,737
It looks good on me anyway.
You don't want to lend me your clothes.

1198
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,948
I will just wash them or buy you new ones!

1199
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,450
Vicky, can we talk?

1200
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:26,245
What for? We are done!

1201
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:30,541
-Bert is here. Get out!
-You need to hear me out.

1202
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:32,710
-[Benedict] Please hear me out.
-Go out!

1203
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,003
Get out of here!

1204
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:38,007
Ouch! I want to explain everything to you.

1205
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:42,303
Please forget about
whatever I did wrong before.

1206
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:45,890
Which one?
Neglecting me as your girlfriend?

1207
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,474
[rattling]

1208
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:48,726
[grunts]

1209
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:51,187
I can never do that to you.

1210
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:53,856
I mean, Vicky!

1211
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,859
See, you're still thinking
about the girl in the bar.

1212
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,278
You did it when we were still together.

1213
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:03,073
You don't have time for me
or for our relationship.

1214
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:06,869
You only care about yourself.
So please get out of here.

1215
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:08,037

1216
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,872
[grunting]

1217
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:11,707
But Vicky,

1218
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:13,584
please forgive me.

1219
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:15,502
Let me explain.

1220
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,005
Everything is clear to me.

1221
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:21,091
Because of what you did, I met Bert.

1222
01:10:21,175 --> 01:10:25,095
He showed me how to love and be loved.

1223
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,515

-[gasping]
-[woman] Hey! What are you doing there?

1227
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,369
[screaming]

1228
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,662
Ouch!

1229
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,373
Are you okay?

1230
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:55,918
[gasping]

1231
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,711
-Mom?
-[gasps]

1232
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,839
I'm not your mom.
I don't have a husband and kids.

1233
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:03,050
[grunting]

1234
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,594
You're overreacting.
You won’t die jumping from there.

1235
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,096
That’s too low!

1236
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:10,599
You should be thankful
that I have not put away my laundry.

1237
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:15,145
-[flicking lighter]
-[Benedict grunting]

1238
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:17,856
Hey! Don't jump.

1239
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:21,068
I'm not jumping. I'm just stretching.

1240
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:22,945
My body aches because of my fall.

1241
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:26,991
You know what?
You really have a big problem.

1242
01:11:27,074 --> 01:11:28,200
Bigger than you think.

1243
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:32,371
It's because the person I love
went with someone else.

1244
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,915
But why?

1245
01:11:35,624 --> 01:11:40,379
I don't know. I've done everything
I could, but it still happened.

1246
01:11:41,005 --> 01:11:42,298
Are you sure?

1247
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,882
You know how she feels?

1248
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:46,260
We women,
what we expect from the person we love

1249
01:11:46,343 --> 01:11:48,595
is that they know how we feel
even without talking.

1250
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:49,972
That they understand us.

1251
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:51,181
Wait up.

1252
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,226
I'm the one who has a problem.
Why are you upset?

1253
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:57,980
You remind me of my love. Dominador.

1254
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,607
Why? What happened between you and Dad?

1255
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,484
I mean with the person you love.

1256
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,904
My parents don't want him for me.

1257
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:07,906
They want me to work abroad.

1258
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:09,783
How will I be born?

1259
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:14,413
When you love someone,
shouldn't you fight for him?

1260
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:18,334
You still have time.
Do everything you can.

1261
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:23,088
It’s a beautiful thing you said.

1262
01:12:27,926 --> 01:12:30,012
Wait. What are you doing?

1263
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,265
It’s your fault. I remembered
my Dominador,

1264
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,100
and what you said was so beautiful.

1265
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,436
You know what? You're right.

1266
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:41,273
I still have time. I'll tell Mama and Papa
that I love Dominador very much.

1267
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,734
And I will do everything
for us not to separate.

1268
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:46,862
What you said was nice.

1269
01:12:47,446 --> 01:12:50,324
That's what I'm going to do with Vicky.
I still have time.

1270
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:51,909
You're amazing, Mom!

1271
01:12:51,992 --> 01:12:54,078
I'm not your mom!

1272
01:12:54,161 --> 01:12:55,788
Virginia is my name.

1273
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,457
Virginia, I am Benedict.

1274
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,876
Benedict.

1275
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:02,461
Thank you.

1276
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,257

Where is Bert?

1278
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:29,863
Vicky, forget about Bert.

1279
01:13:30,531 --> 01:13:32,241
Vicky, I still love you.

1280
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:34,827
Come with me and I’ll give you everything.

1281
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:39,206
-I'll do everything you want.
-I thought you already understood me?

1282
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,542
Vicky,

1283
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,586
give me a second chance.

1284
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,713
Like what John Lloyd once said,

1285
01:13:48,006 --> 01:13:50,843
"Give me one more chance
to show you how much I love you."

1286
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,429
Vicky, I can't live without you,
no matter when.

1287
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,098
Who is John Lloyd?

1288
01:13:57,724 --> 01:13:59,852
John Lloyd, the poet.

1289
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,813
Ben! I don't love you anymore.

1290
01:14:02,896 --> 01:14:06,191

No, thanks.

I said I don't want to eat!

If only I knew that

1326
01:16:47,686 --> 01:16:49,646
I would see Mom
for the last time at the airport,

1327

I wish I didn't let her go.

01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:04,354
My love.

1435
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:06,606
Mom…

1436
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:10,860
[heart beating heavily]

1437
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:23,873
Mom?

1438
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:32,882
[crying]

1439
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,304
Why wasn't I able to stop my Mom's death?

1440
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:41,933
Benedict.

1441
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:44,811
In this journey,

1442
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:47,188
it's a different story

1443
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,441
when it comes to…

1444
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,902
life and death.

1445
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,948
The only thing permanent is…

1446
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:01,411
the birth and death of a person.

1447
01:24:01,995 --> 01:24:03,663
What's the use of that Wishkey

1448
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,623
if it can't change my fate?

1449
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:07,625
[sighs]

1450
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:10,170
The purpose of the Wishkey

1451
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,548
is not to change what happened in the past

1452
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,761
but rather for you to realize and change

1453
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,890
what you should do in the present.

1454
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:25,226
But how do you know about this?

1455
01:24:25,977 --> 01:24:26,936
Who are you?

1456
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,939
Like you, I also made a mistake.

1457
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:33,068
I also wanted to go back.

1458
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,655
I abused it
because of my selfish intentions.

1459
01:24:38,573 --> 01:24:41,743
This is my punishment.

1460
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,079
Listen to those who failed,

1461
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:47,749
those who have been hurt many times,

1462
01:24:48,458 --> 01:24:49,459
so I can teach

1463
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,463
the right things from my experience.

1464
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:00,845
Last shot?

1465
01:25:09,395 --> 01:25:10,563
-Cheers?
-Table.

1466
01:25:17,612 --> 01:25:19,697

1467

[sighs]

1468
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:32,210
[Victoria] Babe, it is not my birthday.

1469
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,880
It is also not our anniversary.

1470
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:37,799
What's this for?

1471
01:25:38,508 --> 01:25:40,718
I know there's something
you want to tell me.

1472
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:43,012
But,

1473
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:45,348
is it okay if I go first?

1474
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:48,309
You know what I want to tell you?

1475
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:49,811
You want

1476
01:25:51,146 --> 01:25:52,856
to break up with me, right?

1477
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:55,358
[sighs deeply]

1478
01:25:56,776 --> 01:25:58,778
Wait, babe, they’ll sing.

1479
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:01,823
[guitar playing]

1480
01:26:05,201 --> 01:26:07,328
Our relationship is getting toxic.

1481
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:10,874
You want me to obey you always.

1482
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,961
-This restaurant--
-Because

1483
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,297
you're allergic to seafood.

1484
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:19,507
You know what, babe?

1485
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,093
You're right.

1486
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,679
No matter what your decision is,

1487
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:27,891
I will understand.

1488
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:33,521
Because I'm not the old Benedict
that will control your life.

1489
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,360
I will give you freedom.

1490
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:44,991
Freedom to decide for yourself
and for your family.

1491
01:26:47,577 --> 01:26:48,536
No matter

1492
01:26:50,663 --> 01:26:52,498
how many years will pass by…

1493
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:58,838
my love for you will never change.

1494
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:02,508
I'm sorry, Benedict.

1495
01:27:06,429 --> 01:27:07,388
[sighs]

1496
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:11,559
[in English] It's okay. I understand.

1497
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:26,824

[man] Hey, stop it, bro…

1501
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:09,200
[man] Listen to me.

1502
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:12,036
[man] Our friends left us already.

1503
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,372
Hey, bro…

-[thunder rumbling]

1505

1506
01:28:25,133 --> 01:28:26,676
[man] We can go home now.

1507

[thunder rumbling]

1508
01:28:30,972 --> 01:28:32,515
[man] Ouch!

We haven't been paid yet.

They finally meet.

You're late.

Sorry, we came from work, then--

Wait.

1539
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,618
Did we have plans for tonight?

1540

Ah, it's just that…

1541
01:31:02,081 --> 01:31:03,791
I always think of you.

1542
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,878
And I always listen to your podcasts.

1543
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,048
The reason why I'm here…

1544
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,925
How do I say this?

1545
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:15,553
Ben, I want to tell you that…

1546
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,305
Uh…

1547
01:31:18,514 --> 01:31:22,143
[in Victoria's voice] I'm giving you
a second chance for us to be okay.

1548

How did you do that?

1549
01:31:25,813 --> 01:31:27,440
Is that what you want?

1550
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,568
Well, it's up to you.

1551
01:31:31,068 --> 01:31:34,030
But if you don't want to,
then I'll just leave.

1552

There's no problem if you want us to talk

1553
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:38,910
and fix things.

1554
01:31:39,911 --> 01:31:42,496
See? It's meant to be.

1555
01:31:43,289 --> 01:31:45,750
Look, it’s Valentine’s Day.

1556

Valentine’s Day?

Babe, it's not yet Valentine's Day.

1558
01:31:51,464 --> 01:31:52,381
From what I know,

1559
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:55,968
it's National Heart Attack
Awareness Day today.

1560
01:31:57,970 --> 01:32:00,097
[mascot] Let us take care of our hearts.

Is that him?

01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,714
Wait.

1575
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,550

Hey, love.

01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:51,983
Wait. I'm confused.

1583
01:32:52,775 --> 01:32:54,485
-He's your boss.
-Yes.

1584
01:32:54,568 --> 01:32:56,487
But he wanted you
to go to Singapore, right?

1585
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:57,863
He was tearing us apart.

1586
01:32:57,947 --> 01:32:58,781
What?

1587
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,410
Stella is Humberto's girlfriend.

1588
01:33:02,493 --> 01:33:03,577
Not me.

1589
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,914
[Humberto] Dude, you're lucky
to have her as girlfriend.

1590
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:08,165
She loves you so much.

1591
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:12,044
-She even refused the offer for Singapore.
-That's why I got promoted.

1592
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:13,796
I'll fly to Singapore next week.

-Is it true, babe? You're not leaving?
-Yes…

Yes. That's what I was talking about.

-We will be together.
-Yes!

Direk! Direk?

Why are you here?

1604
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,754
I'm so sick of being handsome.

I wanna go back to my old self.
