1
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:09,607
He's not going to take you.

2
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,397
Who?

3
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,476
No one.

4
00:05:16,718 --> 00:05:18,581
No one's going to
take you from me.

5
00:05:55,729 --> 00:05:58,421
Who is it that's coming
to take me, Mum?

6
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,229
Who is it that's coming
to take me, Mum?

7
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,025
Surrender yourself to God.

8
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:40,268
Before we proceed to completion
of this execution...

9
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:43,979
...I, as representative
for the County Council...

10
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:45,994
...shall read the sentence.

11
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:55,283
Through the defendant's voluntary
and credible confessions...

12
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,281
...it has been concluded:

13
00:06:57,656 --> 00:07:01,547
Partly that Anna Mansdotter
has committed fornication...

14
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,689
...with her son Per Nilsson...

15
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,330
...even after he had entered
into marriage...

16
00:07:07,448 --> 00:07:09,283
...with Hanna Johansdotter.

17
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:16,224
Partly that the defendant decided
to take Hanna Johansdotter's life...

18
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:18,648
...and on the night of
the 28th of March...

19
00:07:18,968 --> 00:07:20,812
...1889...

20
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:23,478
...brought that decision...

21
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,359
...to its fruition.

22
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:32,366
What's up with the girl?

23
00:07:33,476 --> 00:07:35,039
Give her something to eat.

24
00:07:55,563 --> 00:07:57,359
There's a light on
at Per Nilsson's.

25
00:07:58,172 --> 00:07:59,538
They're up late.

26
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:02,995
The in-laws are visiting.

27
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:06,388
They're staying a few days.

28
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,023
But the light's on
in the farm-hand's room.

29
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:10,328
Really?

30
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:14,476
Yes, you're right.

31
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:18,741
Isn't that Anna Mansdotter?

32
00:08:18,913 --> 00:08:20,054
Looks like her.

33
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,871
She's probably going to get to
Vittskovle early for market day.

34
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,085
I call the meeting to order...
Quiet please!

35
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:43,179
There seemed nothing untoward
when I called on the Nilssons.

36
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:48,273
But then I thought it odd they'd left
without locking up.

37
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,345
It was strangely quiet.

38
00:08:53,212 --> 00:08:54,689
I called out to Hanna.

39
00:08:55,188 --> 00:08:56,196
Hanna!

40
00:09:08,446 --> 00:09:09,306
Hanna!

41
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,946
The cellar hatch was open.

42
00:09:25,563 --> 00:09:28,946
Per Nilsson came to see us
at 7 in the morning.

43
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:31,124
He had an arrangement
with my husband Ola.

44
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:33,802
Ola was to help him
with a saw-log.

45
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,525
He was acting so strangely.

46
00:09:36,744 --> 00:09:40,068
Hi Per! You seem very happy.

47
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:43,416
- Aren't I allowed to be?
- Of course you are!

48
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:47,447
Ola will be back soon.
He's out in the paddock.

49
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:50,408
Would you like a coffee
while you're waiting?

50
00:09:51,954 --> 00:09:53,713
It's such a lovely morning.

51
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:56,314
Really lovely.

52
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,697
Have Hanna's parents arrived yet?

53
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:00,281
Hanna's parents?

54
00:10:00,377 --> 00:10:01,088
Yes...

55
00:10:01,431 --> 00:10:03,494
She said they were due
any day now.

56
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:06,198
Goodness, I haven't given you sugar.

57
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:08,502
Good heavens!

58
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,799
No, they haven't come yet.

59
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:14,111
They wouldn't get here
before dinnertime.

60
00:10:15,017 --> 00:10:16,143
So this is the time...

61
00:10:16,478 --> 00:10:18,533
"The time"...
What do you mean?

62
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:24,635
Then he was back
to his usual self.

63
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,484
- Ola!
- Hi, Per.

64
00:11:00,771 --> 00:11:02,109
Erik Olsson!

65
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,781
A couple of hours later,
I went back to Per Nilsson's.

66
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:13,430
He was home.

67
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:15,656
I asked after Hanna.

68
00:11:16,188 --> 00:11:18,039
He said she'd gone
to see a neighbour.

69
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:21,070
Something didn't feel right.

70
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,371
I said I'd come in
and take a look.

71
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,305
Hanna!

72
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:38,453
Why is the the hatch open?

73
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:43,188
What's happened?

74
00:11:44,953 --> 00:11:45,906
She's not moving.

75
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:49,453
She couldn't be dead,
could she?

76
00:11:57,805 --> 00:11:58,938
She's dead.

77
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:01,641
She's killed herself.

78
00:12:09,852 --> 00:12:11,398
Good heavens!

79
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:04,891
What's that?

80
00:13:12,312 --> 00:13:14,342
The mark on her throat...

81
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,086
...like from a noose.

82
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,469
Do you think she's taken
her own life?

83
00:13:21,071 --> 00:13:22,594
Taken her own life?

84
00:13:23,984 --> 00:13:25,422
She couldn't have.

85
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:27,859
Why would she do that?

86
00:13:30,812 --> 00:13:32,500
This is a serious matter.

87
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,680
It's not up to us...

88
00:13:35,516 --> 00:13:37,037
We need to speak
with the pastor.

89
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,234
The pastor?

90
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:39,672
We don't want anything
to do with him.

91
00:13:40,055 --> 00:13:40,961
"We"?

92
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:42,344
We who?

93
00:13:44,695 --> 00:13:46,633
We... here in this house.

94
00:13:47,031 --> 00:13:48,672
You mean you
and your mother?

95
00:13:49,297 --> 00:13:50,875
You're not churchgoers...

96
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,344
True.

97
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:55,123
But this is about Hanna,
and her rights before God.

98
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:57,805
If she was driven
to take her own life...

99
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,531
...or if someone else
has taken it.

100
00:14:06,438 --> 00:14:08,016
Who would that be?

101
00:14:33,479 --> 00:14:35,266
We've sent word
to your mother.

102
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,039
Mother?

103
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,883
She wouldn't be up
to taking the long way.

104
00:14:42,359 --> 00:14:43,875
It's 15 km to grandma's.

105
00:14:43,979 --> 00:14:47,320
Johanna saw her leaving
around 5 this morning.

106
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,697
Saw her?

107
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:54,531
- Mother?
- Anna Mansdotter, yes.

108
00:14:55,977 --> 00:14:57,398
She saw it was mother?

109
00:14:58,516 --> 00:15:02,102
She didn't see her face clearly,
but she was pretty sure.

110
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,080
She shouldn't talk about
things she doesn't know!

111
00:15:58,148 --> 00:15:59,469
She's coming now.

112
00:16:37,979 --> 00:16:39,422
So how did this happen?

113
00:16:43,354 --> 00:16:46,213
- Lost your tongues?
- No one knows what happened.

114
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:48,400
Was no one here
when it happened?

115
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:50,385
Nope.

116
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,018
That was odd.

117
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,768
There's usually lots of people
running around here.

118
00:17:16,497 --> 00:17:18,044
Are you quite sure
shes really dead?

119
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:18,903
Quite.

120
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,161
Have you nothing to do?

121
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:28,810
We have to respect
when someone's died.

122
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,692
You believe that?

123
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:33,466
A bunch of ignorant peasants.

124
00:17:35,312 --> 00:17:38,638
To be sure she's not buried alive,
she should be bled.

125
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:41,411
That will be up to the pastor.

126
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:44,021
Pastor?!

127
00:17:44,123 --> 00:17:45,419
That's right.

128
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:49,255
The men are writing a letter
to the pastor.

129
00:17:50,979 --> 00:17:52,052
What about?

130
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,802
What letter?
What's the point of that?

131
00:17:58,938 --> 00:18:00,763
Don't you want to
see the corpse?

132
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:16,151
Per...

133
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,614
Don't you want to see
your wife?

134
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:21,624
No... I can't.

135
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:28,544
Your mother's a hard woman.

136
00:18:28,935 --> 00:18:31,271
You think so?
You don't know her!

137
00:19:22,544 --> 00:19:23,591
Listen, lad...

138
00:19:23,716 --> 00:19:25,364
It's best you stay apart
from your mother...

139
00:19:25,818 --> 00:19:27,208
...until this matter
is cleared up

140
00:19:27,372 --> 00:19:29,669
No... I need
to discuss it with her.

141
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:31,865
Things have to be done right.

142
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:33,771
We'll take her home
to your grandmother's.

143
00:19:34,357 --> 00:19:35,388
- Come on.
- No!

144
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,411
You've no right to separate
my mother and I!

145
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,079
I have to talk with her.

146
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:43,279
Come with us.
It'd be for the best.

147
00:19:43,575 --> 00:19:45,395
You need to stay away
from your mother.

148
00:19:45,608 --> 00:19:47,363
She has sat down
with the devil himself...

149
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:50,208
...and had something to do with this
as you well know.

150
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:13,864
You'll pay dearly for this!

151
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,044
We'll see who'll be paying!

152
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:18,325
Let me go!

153
00:20:26,604 --> 00:20:28,481
Jesus, I hope they lock her up.

154
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:30,271
Shall we see her again?

155
00:20:30,724 --> 00:20:33,482
She'll be locked up
so long as we stick together.

156
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:35,536
We know what she's going for.

157
00:20:36,688 --> 00:20:39,224
But whatever's going to happen
with poor Per?

158
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:41,435
Can't be any worse for him.

159
00:20:44,188 --> 00:20:46,247
Such a kind, modest boy.

160
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:33,645
Why can't I be with my mother?

161
00:21:34,591 --> 00:21:36,481
I must go to her.

162
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:40,380
I have to be with her.

163
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:42,536
From the depths...

164
00:21:42,981 --> 00:21:44,294
to the heights...

165
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,069
there rules an invisible hand

166
00:21:48,122 --> 00:21:50,974
And eyes that never close...

167
00:21:51,364 --> 00:21:53,849
...watch over every little thing.

168
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:58,786
Beat your chest and tremble...

169
00:21:59,669 --> 00:22:02,716
You are stirred
by the Avenger's gaze.

170
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:07,388
You that witness shall not die...

171
00:22:07,849 --> 00:22:10,185
...as it followed you
where e'er you went.

172
00:22:11,521 --> 00:22:14,985
Can this thing also be hidden...

173
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:19,166
...culprit for a baffled world.

174
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:20,841
God help me!

175
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:23,903
Help me, God!

176
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,419
I've killed her!

177
00:22:28,067 --> 00:22:29,786
I've killed her!

178
00:22:48,927 --> 00:22:51,458
Do you admit to
taking your wife's life...

179
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,349
...of your own volition?

180
00:22:53,662 --> 00:22:54,622
Yes.

181
00:22:54,729 --> 00:22:58,560
Has anyone else put the idea
of murder in your head.

182
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,856
No.

183
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:08,067
But your wife would have
been in bed

184
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,614
How could you dress the body
on your own?

185
00:23:11,482 --> 00:23:12,583
It wasn't hard.

186
00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:18,153
When I pulled on one of the sleeves,
Satan was there to pull on the other.

187
00:23:21,438 --> 00:23:23,849
How did you get the body
into the cellar, alone?

188
00:23:24,334 --> 00:23:25,708
Satan helped me.

189
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,474
We'll ignore that.

190
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:31,064
You've made admissions in the presence 
of Hanna's father and Johan Olsson.

191
00:23:31,605 --> 00:23:33,344
First you choked your wife...

192
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:36,779
Then you hit her in
head with a mangle roller.

193
00:23:37,255 --> 00:23:38,759
Is that correct?

194
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,800
Yes.

195
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,964
Your mother said
that you hit her a log.

196
00:23:44,527 --> 00:23:47,691
I should know...
I hit her with a mangle roller.

197
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:49,956
- Why did your mother say that?
- She didn't.

198
00:23:50,324 --> 00:23:51,925
They lie
to get her locked up.

199
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,324
They've always 
been against her.

200
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,519
They've no respect for her.

201
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:56,605
How can that be?

202
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:59,066
They can't stand her,
because she's not like them.

203
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:07,699
I call this meeting to order.
Quiet please.

204
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:13,597
Why did you kill your wife?

205
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:15,909
What was the motive?

206
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:19,659
I felt repugnance for her.

207
00:24:20,769 --> 00:24:22,027
For what reason?

208
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:26,792
I can't really say.

209
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,167
Was there something...

210
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,113
...wrong with her?

211
00:24:35,812 --> 00:24:36,847
No...

212
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,120
Not wrong, exactly.

213
00:24:39,683 --> 00:24:42,988
Something must have been wrong,
to give you a motive.

214
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:50,800
She wasn't happy
at the farm.

215
00:24:51,355 --> 00:24:52,839
She just wanted to move.

216
00:24:53,777 --> 00:24:55,292
And she couldn't
stand my mother.

217
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,886
Nothing wrong to give
reason for her murder!

218
00:25:01,397 --> 00:25:03,394
There was the dowry question.

219
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:05,840
She didn't bring as much
as had been promised.

220
00:25:07,521 --> 00:25:10,613
Do you think your motives
sound convincing?

221
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:14,363
I don't know...
I thought so then.

222
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,972
Bring in Anna Mansdotter.

223
00:25:57,784 --> 00:26:00,964
How was the relationship between you
and your daughter-in-law?

224
00:26:06,021 --> 00:26:09,620
Witnesses say she was always
crying in your presence.

225
00:26:10,854 --> 00:26:11,627
Yes.

226
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,073
Why was that?

227
00:26:16,136 --> 00:26:17,940
She could never explain why.

228
00:26:19,143 --> 00:26:21,393
Because you treated her badly?

229
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:23,636
 I never did that.

230
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,136
There was no reason.

231
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:29,339
She was nice to me.

232
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:32,971
Sometimes...

233
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:35,995
...she gave me food
behind my son's back.

234
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:38,503
Behind his back?

235
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:39,971
Yes.

236
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,003
Per refused to give me food.

237
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:47,370
What reasons did Per have
for killing his wife?

238
00:26:51,604 --> 00:26:53,628
Per is bad with money.

239
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:57,118
When my husband died...

240
00:26:57,643 --> 00:26:59,331
...there was 1,600 kronor
in the bank.

241
00:27:00,562 --> 00:27:02,378
After a few years,
only debts.

242
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:07,200
If Hanna's father had helped Per
as he promised...

243
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:09,464
...I'm sure the murder
would never have happened.

244
00:27:13,479 --> 00:27:16,175
So you didn't influence your son
to commit the murder?

245
00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:18,370
No.

246
00:27:19,146 --> 00:27:21,378
Weren't you there
on the night of the murder?

247
00:27:21,954 --> 00:27:22,800
No.

248
00:27:23,521 --> 00:27:30,393
4 witnesses saw you the same morning
going from Per's to your mother's.

249
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:34,065
They're lying.

250
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:38,675
They'll keep on lying
until I'm locked up.

251
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:40,768
You'll see!

252
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:44,909
You say I've committed murder!

253
00:27:45,753 --> 00:27:47,112
What about me?

254
00:27:47,604 --> 00:27:49,253
The whole mob of you
want ME dead!

255
00:27:58,063 --> 00:28:01,120
The dead woman was properly dressed...

256
00:28:01,503 --> 00:28:03,527
...all nice and neatly

257
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:08,104
That is... nice and neat and properly.

258
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:14,339
Are you saying that a man on his own
couldn't do it that well?

259
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:17,487
Well I certainly couldn't.

260
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:22,104
Particularly the suspenders...

261
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:25,277
I noticed how well
they were tied.

262
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:27,863
Men can't do that.

263
00:28:28,328 --> 00:28:31,557
Are you still denying
that you assisted your son?

264
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:35,784
Yes.

265
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:40,745
Why did you make the mysterious visit
the day before the murder.

266
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:47,448
On the morning you went
from your mother's to Per's farm...

267
00:28:48,073 --> 00:28:50,535
Paid a visit... didn't you?

268
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:54,885
No.

269
00:28:55,346 --> 00:28:57,128
Think carefully.

270
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:07,386
Yes... perhaps...

271
00:29:09,636 --> 00:29:12,217
I looked in on the Grave-Karnas.

272
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:15,753
Grave-Karna... that witch!

273
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:20,214
She's been seeing her
for years.

274
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:22,721
What did you and Grave-Karna
talk about?

275
00:29:24,081 --> 00:29:24,940
What?

276
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:30,018
About trying to fix things
between Per and Hanna.

277
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:31,745
Weren't things good
between Per and Hanna?

278
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:34,104
- No.
- Why?

279
00:29:35,284 --> 00:29:36,487
How would I know?

280
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:40,245
Did she say
she could help them?

281
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,034
She said...

282
00:29:45,065 --> 00:29:46,354
...that they should
be patient.

283
00:29:46,938 --> 00:29:49,620
Did Per know that
you visited that... woman?

284
00:29:54,456 --> 00:29:56,159
You don't like
talking about that?

285
00:30:00,854 --> 00:30:05,477
Per Nilsson, do you know that woman...
Grave-Karna?

286
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:10,081
Yes, I've heard about her.

287
00:30:10,438 --> 00:30:14,636
Have you heard that your mother visited her
the day before the night of murder?

288
00:30:17,596 --> 00:30:19,581
No, I didn't know about that.

289
00:30:20,886 --> 00:30:23,925
That's remarkable.
It was for your sake she went.

290
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:28,440
For my sake?

291
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,277
Exactly!

292
00:30:31,354 --> 00:30:34,518
To help make things up
between you and your wife.

293
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,596
Did my mother say that?

294
00:30:41,768 --> 00:30:42,636
Yes.

295
00:30:48,651 --> 00:30:50,245
Then it must be so.

296
00:30:52,354 --> 00:30:54,839
But she's never said anything
to you about it?

297
00:30:59,729 --> 00:31:01,604
Could you see Grave-Karna
for me...

298
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:04,941
Tell her I didn't say anything
that could hurt her.

299
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:09,870
Tell her she's not to take revenge.

300
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:24,917
What was it she wanted?

301
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,026
She was worried...

302
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:34,815
...about the daughter-in-law,
who was troublesome.

303
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,198
What did you tell her?

304
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:43,057
I said that...

305
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:47,159
...Hanna was a nice girl...

306
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:49,441
..and she should
just be patient...

307
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:52,151
...and things would
sort themselves out.

308
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:54,198
That was good advice.

309
00:31:56,737 --> 00:31:58,995
I usually give good advice!

310
00:31:59,444 --> 00:32:00,940
Was Anna satisfied
with that?

311
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,456
As far as I know.

312
00:32:03,034 --> 00:32:05,534
You didn't promise
to help her?

313
00:32:07,276 --> 00:32:08,628
In what way?

314
00:32:11,714 --> 00:32:14,620
In fixing things up
between Hanna and Per, of course.

315
00:32:15,188 --> 00:32:17,362
I never make promises.

316
00:32:18,495 --> 00:32:20,151
Just give "good advice".

317
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,831
He can always call in
to see me.

318
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:34,651
I can't take
any more of this.

319
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:37,152
Now the truth will come out.

320
00:32:38,021 --> 00:32:42,792
Hanna herself went to Grave-Karna,
begging for help.

321
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:44,698
Help with what?

322
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:45,897
With Per of course!

323
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:47,995
Coz he didn't treat her
like a wife.

324
00:32:48,503 --> 00:32:50,081
What's meant by that?

325
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:03,112
Your worship would surely know
what a man does with his wife?

326
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:08,292
You've been married
and had children.

327
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:14,988
Well, Per Nilsson...

328
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:18,589
Had you had sexual intercourse
with your wife?

329
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:24,667
Do you not wish
to answer that?

330
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:27,916
No, I hadn't.

331
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:29,784
Why not?

332
00:33:30,718 --> 00:33:33,041
Well, I shall tell you!
It's something not spoken about.

333
00:33:33,253 --> 00:33:34,815
Everyone in the district knows.

334
00:33:35,406 --> 00:33:37,050
It was that Per
and his mother have...

335
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,784
The two of them...

336
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:43,604
They have...

337
00:33:44,347 --> 00:33:45,307
Yes?

338
00:33:48,563 --> 00:33:51,236
Anna was jealous of Hanna.

339
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:52,815
That's the honest truth.

340
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:55,253
She couldn't stand Per
sharing a bed with his wife.

341
00:33:56,628 --> 00:34:00,206
Did you dissuade Per from being 
intimate with his wife?

342
00:34:00,878 --> 00:34:01,643
No.

343
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:04,409
You were aware that it was
not a proper marriage?

344
00:34:05,225 --> 00:34:06,166
Yes.

345
00:34:06,469 --> 00:34:08,003
Did you not think it strange?

346
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:09,721
No.

347
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:13,307
Did you share your bed with your son,
before his marriage?

348
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:15,175
No.

349
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:17,526
Did you two fornicate?

350
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,104
No.

351
00:34:27,354 --> 00:34:30,050
Did you promise not to
get close to Hanna?

352
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:31,206
No.

353
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:34,143
So explain why you didn't?

354
00:34:34,925 --> 00:34:37,534
It is natural behavior
between spouse.

355
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:40,034
Well?!

356
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,831
I was in love with someone else.

357
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:48,237
Yes... well, who were you
in love with?

358
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,120
Do I have to say?

359
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:56,917
Of course.  Otherwise,
we can't believe you.

360
00:35:00,938 --> 00:35:02,018
It was...

361
00:35:02,425 --> 00:35:04,417
Anna Jonsson in Yngsjo.

362
00:35:04,815 --> 00:35:06,024
No...

363
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:09,675
I never noticed that Per
was in love with me.

364
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:13,925
He certainly never said anything.

365
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:16,370
Maybe he was too shy.

366
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,940
No... I don't know.

367
00:35:20,558 --> 00:35:21,565
No...

368
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,706
I really don't think he was
at all interested in me.

369
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:27,917
A girl can sense those things.

370
00:35:29,737 --> 00:35:32,198
No, Per Nilsson...

371
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:35,792
Anna Jonsson was unaware
of your feelings for her.

372
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,112
But you committed a murder
on account of her?

373
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,620
Yes.

374
00:35:42,271 --> 00:35:46,659
She's got the devil on her side.

375
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:51,815
The old judge was an idiot
who let himself be fooled.

376
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:56,084
But the new one is clamping down
on everyone.

377
00:35:57,401 --> 00:35:59,362
Describe how you killed your wife!

378
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:03,534
It was 3 or 4 o'clock
in the morning.

379
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:08,151
Speak up!

380
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,169
I leaned over her...

381
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:14,488
...and grabbed her
by the throat.

382
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,417
- Did she resist?
- No.

383
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:18,691
You have said that
she begged for her life.

384
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:19,913
She did.

385
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:21,409
So she must have resisted.

386
00:36:21,511 --> 00:36:22,393
No, she didn't.

387
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,878
How is that possible?

388
00:36:26,261 --> 00:36:28,081
- I was on top of her...
- Speak up!

389
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,526
I was on top of her...

390
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:34,081
She couldn't move.

391
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,714
What did you do
when she'd stopped breathing?

392
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:44,582
I hit her with the mangle roller.

393
00:36:44,901 --> 00:36:48,073
You must have got blood on the clothes
when you dressed her.

394
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,788
I hit her after I'd dressed her.

395
00:36:51,979 --> 00:36:56,354
According to the medical report,
she was hit right after being strangled.

396
00:36:58,169 --> 00:36:59,729
I don't understand that.

397
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,917
What about the stockings?

398
00:37:03,182 --> 00:37:05,346
Did you pull them on
first or last?

399
00:37:07,938 --> 00:37:09,198
I don't remember.

400
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,237
How did you secure
the suspender belt?

401
00:37:14,706 --> 00:37:16,096
I don't remember.

402
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:21,550
Will someone give me
a suspender belt?

403
00:37:33,771 --> 00:37:35,784
Show me how you tie
a suspender belt.

404
00:37:54,396 --> 00:37:56,456
You must know
some other way.

405
00:38:08,646 --> 00:38:10,307
Another way!

406
00:38:16,229 --> 00:38:17,792
Don't you know
any other way?

407
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:26,714
Well?

408
00:38:39,995 --> 00:38:41,909
Bring in Anna Mansdotter!

409
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:18,393
That's just the way
it was tied.

410
00:39:28,854 --> 00:39:31,636
Were you present
at the murder scene?

411
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:33,323
No.

412
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:44,737
But 3 witnesses saw you
at the farm.

413
00:39:46,103 --> 00:39:47,378
- They're lying.
- All of them?

414
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:50,526
Yes, they're all lying.

415
00:39:51,104 --> 00:39:53,104
So it's only Per
who tells the truth?

416
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:57,026
Yes.

417
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,628
Empty the room!

418
00:40:09,271 --> 00:40:11,964
Now they'll be poking in the dung-heap.

419
00:40:12,846 --> 00:40:15,136
Probably best
not to have to listen.

420
00:40:16,438 --> 00:40:18,881
Is it true that before
your son's marriage...

421
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:21,292
...you used to sleep
in the same bed as him.

422
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,198
No, it's not true.

423
00:40:29,308 --> 00:40:30,651
Bring the witness

424
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:34,143
I was a maid with Anna's husband.
He died.

425
00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:37,675
When he died, Anna and Per
slept in the same bed.

426
00:40:37,807 --> 00:40:40,440
She was afraid to sleep alone.

427
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:47,331
Anna and Per were living
with our sister for a time...

428
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,979
...and they always slept
in the same bed a night.

429
00:40:51,562 --> 00:40:54,375
One early morning
when I came to Per farm...

430
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,542
...they were asleep
in bed together.

431
00:40:56,938 --> 00:40:59,143
Anna said that she was afraid
of the dark.

432
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:04,018
Well, Anna Mansdotter...

433
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,261
What do you say to
these witnesses?

434
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:07,815
They're lying.

435
00:41:13,354 --> 00:41:15,932
Have you never shared a bed
with your son?

436
00:41:19,307 --> 00:41:21,120
Only when he was younger.

437
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,947
Did you fornicate?

438
00:41:24,658 --> 00:41:25,721
No, never.

439
00:41:31,143 --> 00:41:33,127
Were you jealous of her?

440
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:35,197
Why did you want her
out of the way?

441
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:37,721
I didn't want Hanna
out of the way.

442
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:42,111
Why did you share a bed
with your son?

443
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,557
We have the right to sleep
wherever we wish in our own house!

444
00:41:46,688 --> 00:41:48,643
But you knew it was improper?

445
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,526
It doesn't bother me
what people think of me.

446
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,667
Tell me truthfully...

447
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:58,596
Why did you never touch your wife?

448
00:41:59,221 --> 00:42:00,955
Had you promised
your mother?

449
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,401
No, I was in love
with someone else.

450
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:07,111
No one believes that.
We need another explanation.

451
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:12,729
- Hanna wasn't interested.
- And why was that?

452
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:21,463
According to witnesses she was most
unhappy that you didn't behave normally.

453
00:42:22,896 --> 00:42:25,744
Did your mother not have
anything to do with that?

454
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:26,908
No.

455
00:42:29,229 --> 00:42:31,135
But you and your mother
used to share a bed.

456
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:33,901
That's a fact...

457
00:42:34,197 --> 00:42:36,799
Your mother has admitted
that it has happened.

458
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:40,416
- Mother said that?
- Yes!

459
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:46,096
Why would she?

460
00:42:47,252 --> 00:42:51,471
Witness have seen you in the same bed,
a short time before your marriage.

461
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:52,838
It's not true!

462
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:54,971
Did you fornicate?

463
00:42:56,268 --> 00:42:57,190
No.

464
00:42:57,812 --> 00:42:59,588
What happened
after the murder?

465
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:01,197
After?

466
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:02,291
Exactly!

467
00:43:02,388 --> 00:43:03,986
When the corpse
had been dressed...

468
00:43:04,171 --> 00:43:06,947
and dumped in the cellar,
and the house tidied...

469
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:08,799
Was that coffee time?

470
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:11,479
No, we didn't have coffee.

471
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:12,666
We? We who?

472
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:14,781
- I didn't say we.
- What did you say?

473
00:43:15,377 --> 00:43:17,072
It's not what I meant, anyway.

474
00:43:23,021 --> 00:43:24,666
Take Per Nilsson out!

475
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:27,658
I have to protest.

476
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:28,830
Protest?

477
00:43:28,978 --> 00:43:31,837
Now that you have her
in custody.

478
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:34,103
They could be contradicting 
each other's statements.

479
00:43:34,376 --> 00:43:35,852
With suspect evidence.

480
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,795
She denies it, and there's
no evidence that's conclusive.

481
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:42,533
You're surely not thinking
of acquitting her?

482
00:43:43,506 --> 00:43:44,869
I have no choice.

483
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:47,636
The people are going to protest.

484
00:43:48,615 --> 00:43:50,853
They're not going to like it.

485
00:43:51,665 --> 00:43:52,889
I know.

486
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:56,110
She'll lose her head,
if I'm any judge.

487
00:44:26,729 --> 00:44:27,665
What's wrong?

488
00:44:28,536 --> 00:44:29,946
Why are you standing there?

489
00:44:31,771 --> 00:44:32,979
You're crying!

490
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:34,910
What's up?

491
00:44:37,562 --> 00:44:40,187
I was thinking of Anna
being beheaded.

492
00:44:41,927 --> 00:44:43,213
It was our fault.

493
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:47,272
Maybe she's innocent.

494
00:44:48,006 --> 00:44:50,160
You swore that she was guilty.

495
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,119
But no one saw it.

496
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:56,912
Don't forget that.

497
00:44:57,271 --> 00:44:58,763
Nobody saw it!

498
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:03,249
So you get a reduced penalty,
if you confess?

499
00:45:03,502 --> 00:45:05,949
Yes, that often happens.

500
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:10,039
Maybe you weren't involved
in the actual murder...

501
00:45:10,904 --> 00:45:13,668
...but only helped
to hide the evidence.

502
00:45:14,479 --> 00:45:16,176
- Yes.
- Good.

503
00:45:17,563 --> 00:45:21,778
Then I'll help you to present
your confession in the right way.

504
00:45:22,996 --> 00:45:24,664
Per must attest to it.

505
00:45:26,205 --> 00:45:29,257
It would be enough for ONE head to fall,
wouldn't you say?

506
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:35,108
The trial continued on Saturday
of Per Nilsson from Yngsjo
and his mother Anna Mansdotter.

507
00:45:35,254 --> 00:45:37,264
There was no new evidence,
but it was moving to hear
the murderer's grandmother...

508
00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:39,683
...the near 80-year old Anna Tufvedsdotter
who hobbled up to the judge and said that
she fell asleep about 10 on that night...

509
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:41,534
and that her daughter was
in the process of making...

510
00:45:46,312 --> 00:45:49,011
Who is it that's coming
to take me, Mummy?

511
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:55,795
My poor child.

512
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,346
What is it I'm doing?

513
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:03,275
What am I doing
to hurt you?

514
00:46:16,604 --> 00:46:18,668
Here is your confession...

515
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:22,728
...where you admit that you
were present at the murder...

516
00:46:23,896 --> 00:46:27,654
...that you did nothing
to stop the murder happening...

517
00:46:28,701 --> 00:46:30,865
...and that you helped
to conceal the evidence.

518
00:46:32,771 --> 00:46:34,604
Do you confirm to your confession?

519
00:46:37,868 --> 00:46:38,760
No.

520
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,161
Am I to understand that
you're retracting your confession?

521
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,278
Are you maintaining your innocence?

522
00:46:53,778 --> 00:46:54,638
No.

523
00:46:57,563 --> 00:46:59,049
It was I who did it.

524
00:46:59,131 --> 00:47:00,455
I alone.

525
00:47:02,397 --> 00:47:04,068
Per wasn't even
in the room.

526
00:47:05,912 --> 00:47:08,635
So you're admitting
that you alone were guilty.

527
00:47:09,316 --> 00:47:10,241
Yes.

528
00:47:12,368 --> 00:47:14,431
I was the one who killed Hanna.

529
00:47:17,396 --> 00:47:19,233
Because I loved my son.

530
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:22,919
So it was out of jealousy?

531
00:47:24,312 --> 00:47:27,316
You indulged in illicit love
with your son?

532
00:47:29,402 --> 00:47:30,741
Answer my question.

533
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:34,042
You indulged in illicit love
with your son?

534
00:47:35,312 --> 00:47:36,240
Yes.

535
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:41,167
Did you continue to fornicate with him
after his marriage?

536
00:47:45,798 --> 00:47:47,798
Did you get him to promise...

537
00:47:48,087 --> 00:47:50,593
...not to have intimate relations
with his wife?

538
00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:52,229
Yes.

539
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:57,065
How did the murder happen ?

540
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:03,490
I sneaked into Hanna that night...

541
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:06,635
...while Per was out
in the stables.

542
00:48:09,688 --> 00:48:11,028
So I strangled her.

543
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,330
When Per came back in
she was dead.

544
00:48:15,575 --> 00:48:16,794
That's not true!

545
00:48:17,018 --> 00:48:18,929
My mother's only trying
to save me.

546
00:48:19,716 --> 00:48:21,314
Allow me to point out...

547
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:23,565
As your mother has confessed...

548
00:48:23,997 --> 00:48:27,428
...you can no longer save her
from punishment.

549
00:48:28,994 --> 00:48:30,615
What has she said?

550
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:32,720
I have to know
what she said!

551
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:33,834
Why?

552
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:36,436
You know very well
what took place.

553
00:48:38,303 --> 00:48:40,184
I don't remember everything.

554
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,444
You have to tell me truthfully
exactly what happened.

555
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:45,823
You say one thing,
and Per another.

556
00:48:46,128 --> 00:48:48,978
Trying to protect each other
won't work.

557
00:48:50,764 --> 00:48:52,209
No, I think so.

558
00:48:53,068 --> 00:48:54,889
It doesn't matter what we say.

559
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:58,703
Per insists it was he who hit Hanna
with the mangle-roller.

560
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,724
How could he do that
if he wasn't present?

561
00:49:01,868 --> 00:49:04,450
He was in the room,
and helped out.

562
00:49:04,961 --> 00:49:07,175
The other day you said
he was out in the stables.

563
00:49:08,997 --> 00:49:10,232
I misunderstood the question.

564
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:13,583
So in fact the two of you
were involved in the murder?

565
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:15,801
Yes.

566
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,443
How did the murder happen?

567
00:49:20,021 --> 00:49:23,280
Per hit her with the mangle-roller,
and then we strangled her.

568
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:25,426
Both of you?

569
00:49:28,004 --> 00:49:29,007
No...

570
00:49:31,271 --> 00:49:33,610
Per held her,
while I strangled her.

571
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:42,117
Why did she need to be held
when she'd been knocked senseless?

572
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:47,345
He just stood to one side
and watched

573
00:49:50,384 --> 00:49:54,008
Did per take part at any stage
of the actual murder?

574
00:49:57,078 --> 00:49:58,735
He wasn't all that innocent.

575
00:50:03,938 --> 00:50:05,929
But it was you
who drove him to it...

576
00:50:06,405 --> 00:50:07,503
Right?

577
00:50:07,792 --> 00:50:09,263
Through jealousy!

578
00:50:10,604 --> 00:50:13,247
How old was he the first time
you pressed him into fornication?

579
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,082
I don't remember.

580
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:20,664
Was it before the death
of your husband?

581
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:23,898
No.

582
00:50:28,896 --> 00:50:30,186
I don't believe you.

583
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:33,730
How long had you been fornicating,
before your husband died?

584
00:50:36,771 --> 00:50:38,313
Several years.

585
00:50:39,562 --> 00:50:40,923
How many years?

586
00:50:43,548 --> 00:50:44,813
I don't remember.

587
00:50:45,396 --> 00:50:47,986
How long were you fornicating
before your father's death?

588
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,017
We didn't.

589
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:50,877
- You didn't fornicate.
- No.

590
00:50:52,396 --> 00:50:54,284
Your mother stated
that you did.

591
00:50:55,727 --> 00:50:58,853
My mother said that?
I don't believe it.

592
00:51:00,854 --> 00:51:03,047
Do you think we lie in court?

593
00:51:04,906 --> 00:51:05,786
No, but...

594
00:51:07,474 --> 00:51:09,189
She can't have said that.

595
00:51:09,368 --> 00:51:12,926
Your bother has confessed
that the two of you fornicated.

596
00:51:13,145 --> 00:51:15,118
Do you deny her assertion?

597
00:51:22,063 --> 00:51:23,093
No.

598
00:51:25,646 --> 00:51:27,632
How old were you
when you started?

599
00:51:28,288 --> 00:51:29,518
I don't know.

600
00:51:30,506 --> 00:51:33,289
Did your mother make you promise
not to tough your wife?

601
00:51:33,896 --> 00:51:34,797
No.

602
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:44,022
Your mother has stated that she got
such a promise from you.

603
00:51:46,765 --> 00:51:47,737
Well, then...

604
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:50,617
Yes, she did.

605
00:51:53,214 --> 00:51:55,005
This is getting ridiculous.

606
00:51:56,595 --> 00:51:58,611
The mother comes up with
incessant contradictions...

607
00:51:58,681 --> 00:52:01,635
... and the son says anything
that comes into his head.

608
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,633
We're not making progress.

609
00:52:05,316 --> 00:52:07,215
It's not all that complicated.

610
00:52:08,281 --> 00:52:10,497
The mother is possessed by jealousy.

611
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:13,271
And he is a slave to her will.

612
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,318
That's the basic explanation.

613
00:52:16,271 --> 00:52:19,322
Yes, that's possible...
you could be right

614
00:52:22,755 --> 00:52:25,122
But it may also be
that you're wrong.

615
00:52:35,854 --> 00:52:36,733
Food.

616
00:52:41,313 --> 00:52:43,665
Just have to wait
for a new verdict...

617
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:46,681
We'll see what happens
this time.

618
00:52:47,149 --> 00:52:49,352
At least it should be
the final one.

619
00:53:32,771 --> 00:53:33,907
Are you happy?

620
00:53:34,969 --> 00:53:36,673
Yes, aren't you?

621
00:53:38,251 --> 00:53:39,255
Yes...

622
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:41,761
So long as it works out.

623
00:53:42,128 --> 00:53:43,358
Of course it will.

624
00:53:44,202 --> 00:53:46,413
But only if we're in agreement.

625
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:50,950
And we might finally put a stop
to all the evil gossip.

626
00:53:53,103 --> 00:53:54,574
I'll see you when you come home.

627
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,965
Are you leaving already?

628
00:53:56,028 --> 00:53:57,520
I have to get home tonight.

629
00:53:58,116 --> 00:53:59,323
But it's dark.

630
00:54:00,188 --> 00:54:03,932
You're so afraid
of being alone in the dark!

631
00:54:04,563 --> 00:54:06,377
It's something I'll just
have to get used to.

632
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:09,931
You have your wife
to hold onto, now.

633
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,187
Well, Per...

634
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,609
You're looking pleased.

635
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:51,804
Yes... music, food, lots of people...
That's the life!

636
00:55:51,867 --> 00:55:54,578
I wasn't thinking of that.
I was thinking about Hanna.

637
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:56,656
You got yourself a good girl.

638
00:55:56,852 --> 00:55:58,218
I agree with you there.

639
00:55:58,484 --> 00:56:01,202
I can't say I like her
leaving home.

640
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:04,627
Hanna and I are very close, you know.

641
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,895
I do trust that
you'll look after her.

642
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:10,843
I assure you I'll look after
your daughter.

643
00:56:11,624 --> 00:56:14,249
Don't dance too much
with the other girls.

644
00:56:15,187 --> 00:56:18,437
Hanna can get angry if someone
plays with what's hers.

645
00:56:19,188 --> 00:56:21,508
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

646
00:56:48,146 --> 00:56:49,124
Are you there?

647
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:50,156
Yes.

648
00:56:52,021 --> 00:56:53,148
You're so quiet.

649
00:56:54,671 --> 00:56:56,835
You were talking and laughing
all evening.

650
00:56:57,765 --> 00:56:58,444
Yes.

651
00:57:01,688 --> 00:57:03,405
Aren't you getting undressed?

652
00:57:05,015 --> 00:57:06,241
There's no hurry.

653
00:57:07,938 --> 00:57:09,569
Yes, we've plenty of time now.

654
00:57:23,104 --> 00:57:24,624
You're so serious...

655
00:57:25,616 --> 00:57:27,241
I hardly recognise you.

656
00:57:35,063 --> 00:57:37,054
You do think that
we'll be happy, don't you?

657
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:41,476
Don't you think so?

658
00:57:45,466 --> 00:57:46,898
You're going to be nice.

659
00:57:47,763 --> 00:57:48,929
Do you understand?

660
00:57:52,034 --> 00:57:53,187
Of course!

661
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:05,077
Your hair feels so stiff...

662
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:07,874
Almost like horsehair.

663
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:12,257
Don't you like it?

664
00:58:13,882 --> 00:58:15,163
It's so unusual.

665
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:21,983
You'll get used to it.

666
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:25,523
Things will be better
when we get home.

667
00:58:30,022 --> 00:58:31,842
I wish we could stay here.

668
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,702
Stay here?

669
00:58:36,886 --> 00:58:38,093
Not go home?

670
00:58:41,188 --> 00:58:42,671
What do you mean
by that?

671
00:58:43,491 --> 00:58:46,429
Nothing. It slipped out.
I didn't mean anything by it.

672
00:58:49,171 --> 00:58:50,898
But I'm the lady
of the house, now.

673
00:58:50,923 --> 00:58:52,164
Your mother has to
understand that.

674
00:58:52,836 --> 00:58:54,312
Do you want to create difficulties
with my mother?

675
00:58:54,521 --> 00:58:56,976
I don't want to be difficult,
but I know my rights.

676
00:58:58,046 --> 00:59:00,483
Father has promised
to buy her out from the farm.

677
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:05,827
What is it?

678
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,874
Aren't you going to bed?

679
00:59:10,743 --> 00:59:12,405
In a while.
You go though.

680
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,265
You have your wife
to hold onto, now.

681
01:00:12,797 --> 01:00:14,267
Go and wait inside.

682
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:17,187
No, I'd rather wait for you.

683
01:01:05,104 --> 01:01:07,515
Look... Mother has
set the table for us.

684
01:01:08,226 --> 01:01:09,687
Doing it herself...

685
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:13,359
As if I'm supposed to feel
like a visitor in my own house.

686
01:01:19,148 --> 01:01:20,624
The house is not yours yet.

687
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:34,663
I hope the food is good enough to eat
even though it's me who set the table.

688
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:40,608
Aren't you going to eat, too?

689
01:02:33,271 --> 01:02:35,915
You can't make it so obvious
you'd hate Hanna running the house.

690
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:38,767
You think I should accept
being pushed aside in my own house?

691
01:02:42,243 --> 01:02:44,657
Should I be kept
in the stables instead?

692
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:46,829
No... no...!

693
01:02:47,259 --> 01:02:49,290
We don't have to rush things.

694
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:55,439
Do you know what I think?

695
01:02:56,611 --> 01:02:58,228
There won't be any  money.

696
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:03,243
She'll push me out of here.

697
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:07,025
She'll take everything...

698
01:03:08,146 --> 01:03:10,658
You... the farm...
without paying anything.

699
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,337
You think she's that cunning?

700
01:03:19,604 --> 01:03:22,720
I'm starting to believe that
your marriage was in vain.

701
01:03:56,479 --> 01:03:57,822
I've missed you.

702
01:04:01,673 --> 01:04:03,267
I've missed you so much.

703
01:04:10,938 --> 01:04:12,548
Your hair is so soft.

704
01:07:19,604 --> 01:07:21,579
I can't stand looking at her
any more.

705
01:07:22,017 --> 01:07:24,165
She bursts into tears
whenever she sees me.

706
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,165
That crying is so tedious.

707
01:07:49,556 --> 01:07:51,400
So you think things
are fine as they are?

708
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:52,548
No...

709
01:07:54,048 --> 01:07:55,868
But you must give me
a little time.

710
01:07:57,604 --> 01:08:00,462
It seems as if it were best
that I left the farm for good.

711
01:08:03,587 --> 01:08:05,103
I can't see myself staying.

712
01:08:06,048 --> 01:08:07,548
You don't need me.

713
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:09,868
You have your wife now.

714
01:08:10,353 --> 01:08:12,025
What is it you're saying?

715
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:14,758
You know I can't live without you.

716
01:08:15,353 --> 01:08:16,650
I don't know
what to believe.

717
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:18,884
For God's sake,
what do you mean?

718
01:08:18,939 --> 01:08:22,947
We had agreed that we'd make sure
we got our dowry money for Hanna.

719
01:08:23,877 --> 01:08:26,009
But you haven't done
a thing about it.

720
01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:28,869
I can't go asking him for money

721
01:08:28,894 --> 01:08:30,885
when I haven't done
the right thing by Hanna.

722
01:08:31,142 --> 01:08:32,650
What does that matter?

723
01:08:33,312 --> 01:08:35,509
I simply can't face him.

724
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:44,767
Do something with her then.

725
01:08:45,769 --> 01:08:47,087
I just can't do it.

726
01:08:48,854 --> 01:08:50,728
I can't stand her.

727
01:08:54,562 --> 01:08:57,486
Sometimes I sit up half the night
so I don't need to be near her.

728
01:09:25,062 --> 01:09:26,087
Hanna?

729
01:09:29,486 --> 01:09:31,478
Would you do something for me?

730
01:09:35,146 --> 01:09:36,775
We need peace in this house.

731
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:38,962
I can't put up with this
any longer.

732
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:43,558
Nor I.

733
01:09:43,949 --> 01:09:46,278
Things can never work out
between you and me...

734
01:09:46,303 --> 01:09:48,277
so long as your mother
is in the house.

735
01:09:53,688 --> 01:09:56,910
Everyone around here says
she's a hard and nasty woman.

736
01:09:58,646 --> 01:10:00,566
She has no business being here.

737
01:10:01,941 --> 01:10:03,964
You and I are the ones
who belong together.

738
01:11:17,816 --> 01:11:20,902
You think you can go on
getting away with it, don't you!

739
01:11:21,808 --> 01:11:26,323
You get me my money,
and I'll get out of your life.

740
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:28,136
I should be able
to get the money.

741
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:29,347
- Mother!
- Be quiet!!

742
01:11:31,011 --> 01:11:33,566
You don't understand the game
she and her father are playing.

743
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:37,034
Do you really imagine...

744
01:11:38,097 --> 01:11:39,590
...that you can be
a surrogate for me?

745
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:43,964
That you can take my place
in my own home, with my own son?

746
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,636
Well then?!

747
01:11:46,308 --> 01:11:47,394
Answer me!

748
01:11:49,464 --> 01:11:50,597
Don't you have a tongue?!

749
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,737
I only want my rights.

750
01:11:52,879 --> 01:11:54,112
Your rights?

751
01:11:54,558 --> 01:11:55,777
What rights?!

752
01:11:57,229 --> 01:11:59,651
You can't even give my son
what he needs in bed.

753
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:02,628
What can you give him?
Nothing!

754
01:12:02,971 --> 01:12:04,441
Nothing but tears
and sniveling!

755
01:12:06,730 --> 01:12:07,972
You could give him money!

756
01:12:08,137 --> 01:12:09,175
But he doesn't get it...

757
01:12:10,144 --> 01:12:11,425
...as that gives you power.

758
01:12:12,604 --> 01:12:14,667
You think you'll drive me
out of the house...

759
01:12:15,051 --> 01:12:17,073
..and drive him to death afterwards!

760
01:12:17,793 --> 01:12:19,519
You'll drive him to death!

761
01:12:20,566 --> 01:12:22,683
You want to drive him
out of his mind!

762
01:12:23,588 --> 01:12:27,066
Get out!
Get out of our sight!!

763
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:22,672
I couldn't help it.

764
01:13:26,117 --> 01:13:27,797
I have to protect us.

765
01:13:33,812 --> 01:13:35,055
It's my fault.

766
01:13:39,104 --> 01:13:40,836
If only I could.

767
01:13:42,484 --> 01:13:43,805
If I could...

768
01:13:46,646 --> 01:13:48,227
It's not your fault.

769
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:52,797
I can't even try.

770
01:14:08,329 --> 01:14:09,641
Where were you?

771
01:14:11,344 --> 01:14:14,063
Do you think your mother has a right
 to treat me the way she does?

772
01:14:24,104 --> 01:14:25,594
Are you going to sleep
on the sofa?

773
01:14:28,578 --> 01:14:30,578
Why can't you answer me?

774
01:14:37,604 --> 01:14:38,766
Per...

775
01:14:40,979 --> 01:14:42,992
You have to talk to me.

776
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,117
I'm so lonely here.

777
01:14:50,094 --> 01:14:51,758
I don't have anyone.

778
01:15:14,313 --> 01:15:15,656
It's so wrong.

779
01:15:17,188 --> 01:15:19,305
He doesn't have me
as his wife.

780
01:15:20,273 --> 01:15:21,922
Don't you get together at night?

781
01:15:29,226 --> 01:15:30,953
No... there'll be reasons for that.

782
01:15:31,687 --> 01:15:33,180
What do you mean?

783
01:15:33,604 --> 01:15:35,367
There's nothing wrong with you.

784
01:15:36,741 --> 01:15:38,374
But you've come a cropper here.

785
01:15:40,062 --> 01:15:43,078
You've come a cropper,
falling into that family.

786
01:15:44,586 --> 01:15:46,640
They're created in their own way,
they are.

787
01:15:47,984 --> 01:15:49,257
I don't understand.

788
01:15:49,492 --> 01:15:50,757
It's just as well.

789
01:15:52,812 --> 01:15:55,718
Bring me a pillowslip
that Per has slept on.

790
01:15:56,414 --> 01:15:57,648
A pillowslip?

791
01:15:58,625 --> 01:16:00,046
Yes, a pillowslip.

792
01:16:01,703 --> 01:16:04,445
But he must have SLEPT on it.
Understand?

793
01:16:05,289 --> 01:16:06,117
No.

794
01:16:08,718 --> 01:16:10,038
Bring it as quickly as you can.

795
01:16:10,187 --> 01:16:12,304
We'll see if we can change
who Per's in love with.

796
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:14,242
I'll be back this afternoon.

797
01:16:16,562 --> 01:16:17,773
Wait in the bedroom.

798
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:25,497
Come in.

799
01:16:38,184 --> 01:16:39,364
You have to help me.

800
01:16:41,223 --> 01:16:44,380
It can't go on...
It has to be stopped.

801
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:49,520
You shouldn't drag anyone
into your mess.

802
01:16:49,997 --> 01:16:51,794
I told you that

803
01:16:52,653 --> 01:16:54,215
We had to...
You know that.

804
01:16:57,438 --> 01:16:59,356
Now he doesn't want
to sleep with her?

805
01:17:04,653 --> 01:17:06,098
He can't stand her.

806
01:17:08,981 --> 01:17:10,731
It's time to think about it now.

807
01:17:12,271 --> 01:17:13,895
What's the point
of giving you advice?

808
01:17:14,453 --> 01:17:15,637
You never follow it.

809
01:17:16,262 --> 01:17:17,755
Never have.

810
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:20,176
If you're not going to accept
what I say...

811
01:17:20,824 --> 01:17:22,098
...find out for yourself.

812
01:17:23,396 --> 01:17:24,958
I'll do whatever you say...

813
01:17:25,731 --> 01:17:27,239
...so long as we get rid of her.

814
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,098
You have to be patient.

815
01:17:32,231 --> 01:17:33,723
Leave them in peace...

816
01:17:34,395 --> 01:17:35,864
...and move home
to your mother's.

817
01:17:37,438 --> 01:17:40,833
I'll try and come up
with a solution.

818
01:17:41,012 --> 01:17:43,106
- We can't wait!
- No, of course.

819
01:17:44,271 --> 01:17:47,333
Do as you please...
you always have.

820
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,075
But remember...

821
01:17:52,028 --> 01:17:53,950
If I'm not on your side...

822
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:56,036
...I'm against you.

823
01:17:57,021 --> 01:17:59,739
And you and I have
some old garbage...

824
01:18:00,653 --> 01:18:03,160
...that you wouldn't want
people to smell.

825
01:18:03,354 --> 01:18:04,196
Shut up!

826
01:18:04,622 --> 01:18:06,489
Just reminding you...

827
01:18:07,255 --> 01:18:08,661
...in case you'd forgotten.

828
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:14,997
We need to know
where we stand with each other.

829
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:19,965
For God's sake
come up with something.

830
01:18:21,104 --> 01:18:21,950
God?

831
01:18:23,614 --> 01:18:25,442
What would YOU know
about God?

832
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,411
Do you follow His way?

833
01:18:30,312 --> 01:18:32,715
I don't care which way I follow.

834
01:18:35,969 --> 01:18:37,569
I'm well aware of that!

835
01:18:41,312 --> 01:18:44,340
But other ways also
demand obedience.

836
01:18:44,544 --> 01:18:45,913
Don't forget that.

837
01:19:03,062 --> 01:19:04,179
Who was that?

838
01:19:08,771 --> 01:19:09,796
Anna.

839
01:19:11,979 --> 01:19:13,421
Good God!

840
01:19:28,021 --> 01:19:29,929
You needn't be frightened.

841
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:32,757
Bring me the pillowslip.

842
01:19:33,671 --> 01:19:35,858
Then you'll sleep on it
every single night...

843
01:19:36,437 --> 01:19:37,875
...until it takes effect.

844
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:40,452
I knew it...

845
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:43,897
She wants to harm me.

846
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:15,366
Per!

847
01:20:22,512 --> 01:20:23,522
Per...

848
01:20:25,521 --> 01:20:27,968
I just can't cope, 
until your mother's moved out.

849
01:20:31,236 --> 01:20:33,882
I was thinking about what we
talked about the other day...

850
01:20:34,189 --> 01:20:35,725
About that house for your mother.

851
01:20:35,858 --> 01:20:38,140
I could write to my father.

852
01:20:45,562 --> 01:20:47,921
I can't stand it any longer, Per.

853
01:21:12,288 --> 01:21:13,761
He kissed me!

854
01:21:14,374 --> 01:21:15,945
Today he kissed me!

855
01:21:19,429 --> 01:21:21,929
Only on my cheek...
But at least he did!

856
01:21:22,702 --> 01:21:24,210
How did it come about?

857
01:21:25,858 --> 01:21:29,007
I found out he owed a lot of money 
to Wahlstrom's store...

858
01:21:29,226 --> 01:21:30,647
400 kronor!

859
01:21:31,062 --> 01:21:33,792
I told him I could get the money 
to pay the debt.

860
01:21:34,718 --> 01:21:35,851
So then...

861
01:21:36,897 --> 01:21:38,476
Then he kissed me!

862
01:21:40,257 --> 01:21:41,905
So that's all it was.

863
01:21:45,521 --> 01:21:47,077
At least he gave you a kiss.

864
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:48,983
Yes...

865
01:21:49,358 --> 01:21:51,968
Not what you would call 
a real kiss...

866
01:21:53,124 --> 01:21:54,413
But still...!

867
01:22:30,396 --> 01:22:31,452
Can't bear the sight of me?

868
01:22:32,484 --> 01:22:34,749
It's just I didn't know...

869
01:22:34,851 --> 01:22:36,444
You thought you were rid of me?

870
01:22:38,646 --> 01:22:40,515
You thought you could separate us.

871
01:22:41,937 --> 01:22:43,882
But nothing can separate 
Per and I.

872
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:45,272
Nothing!

873
01:22:45,897 --> 01:22:47,569
Least of all the likes of you!

874
01:22:57,979 --> 01:22:58,999
Mother...

875
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:05,390
I shouldn't have come...

876
01:23:06,757 --> 01:23:08,772
But I had such a longing 
to see you.

877
01:23:10,396 --> 01:23:12,194
It's hard being away 
from here.

878
01:23:13,796 --> 01:23:14,999
Awfully hard

879
01:23:15,271 --> 01:23:16,921
You have to come back, Mother.

880
01:23:17,663 --> 01:23:18,835
I'm so unhappy.

881
01:23:22,562 --> 01:23:24,390
We have to be patient.

882
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:52,827
I can't go there alone 
any longer.

883
01:23:54,749 --> 01:23:56,835
But it's awful having to reveal 
how things stand.

884
01:23:56,976 --> 01:23:59,233
You were quite right to confide.

885
01:24:00,788 --> 01:24:02,179
You just never know.

886
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:04,699
The worst thing
that could happen

887
01:24:04,724 --> 01:24:06,898
would be to let Per build
for his mother on the farm.

888
01:24:07,406 --> 01:24:09,233
But he's so anxious to do it.

889
01:24:10,179 --> 01:24:11,694
He made it quite clear...

890
01:24:11,827 --> 01:24:14,679
...that it was the only way things 
could be made good between us.

891
01:24:15,007 --> 01:24:16,147
I could ask my father.

892
01:24:16,188 --> 01:24:18,452
I say it's the worst
that could happen!

893
01:24:18,866 --> 01:24:20,218
Because Per... he...

894
01:24:24,327 --> 01:24:25,491
What about Per?

895
01:24:30,188 --> 01:24:31,991
Per only has love
for his mother.

896
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:36,108
That type of loving that 
he should have for you!

897
01:24:41,062 --> 01:24:41,929
No...

898
01:24:44,515 --> 01:24:47,085
No... that can't be true.

899
01:24:47,593 --> 01:24:52,468
Get Per to move from here as far away 
as possible, so his mother can't see you.

900
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:57,147
It's the only way you'll ever 
get a proper marriage.

901
01:25:00,146 --> 01:25:01,866
I'll write to my father.

902
01:25:02,789 --> 01:25:05,022
I'll have to beg him 
to help me.

903
01:25:05,604 --> 01:25:09,304
No... there won't be any money 
for building.

904
01:25:11,521 --> 01:25:13,976
Your mother and Hanna 
can never get on together...

905
01:25:15,233 --> 01:25:17,780
...and you are to stay 
with your wife.

906
01:25:21,938 --> 01:25:25,858
There are two properties for sale 
in the Albo district.

907
01:25:27,396 --> 01:25:29,702
If you'd like to sell
here and move there...

908
01:25:30,608 --> 01:25:32,757
...I could help you with money.

909
01:25:34,062 --> 01:25:37,265
But if you reject that proposal...

910
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:42,843
...I'd have to reconsider the situation.

911
01:26:02,354 --> 01:26:03,921
I'm trapped now, Mother.

912
01:26:06,132 --> 01:26:08,257
I can't even pay the interest 
on the 25th.

913
01:26:10,229 --> 01:26:12,640
I'll have to sell, 
move where they say.

914
01:26:15,054 --> 01:26:16,915
What shall I do with Hanna?

915
01:26:17,413 --> 01:26:20,382
She's telling people we don't live 
as man and wife.

916
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:23,569
There's one way.

917
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:25,210
What way?

918
01:26:27,546 --> 01:26:29,007
To get Hanna on our side.

919
01:26:29,562 --> 01:26:31,124
How can that work?

920
01:26:32,718 --> 01:26:34,296
Just leave it to me.

921
01:26:35,241 --> 01:26:36,319
It's easily done.

922
01:26:38,354 --> 01:26:39,678
If she were to die...

923
01:26:42,350 --> 01:26:43,663
What are you saying?!

924
01:26:44,460 --> 01:26:45,842
If she died...

925
01:26:47,421 --> 01:26:49,639
It would be the happiest day 
of my life.

926
01:26:52,312 --> 01:26:54,671
I sometimes feel 
I want to strike her down.

927
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:57,967
It'd be the first time 
in my life, if I hit her.

928
01:27:01,188 --> 01:27:03,421
She hangs over me 
like a bad conscience.

929
01:27:52,229 --> 01:27:56,817
I was wondering if you'd like 
to come and visit my mother.

930
01:27:57,786 --> 01:27:59,536
Get to see how we live.

931
01:28:00,854 --> 01:28:02,442
Maybe on Sunday.

932
01:28:08,396 --> 01:28:10,364
I was going to cook eel.

933
01:28:12,715 --> 01:28:14,012
I know you like it.

934
01:28:18,021 --> 01:28:19,096
What do you say?

935
01:28:19,932 --> 01:28:21,174
I don't know.

936
01:28:28,438 --> 01:28:30,048
It's just that I was thinking...

937
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,682
You've never met Mother.

938
01:28:34,396 --> 01:28:35,557
I don't know...

939
01:28:37,938 --> 01:28:39,283
I don't think...

940
01:28:41,896 --> 01:28:43,861
Do not be so terrified...

941
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,541
I don't want to hurt you.

942
01:28:55,979 --> 01:28:57,768
I can't stay there any longer.

943
01:28:59,938 --> 01:29:01,330
I don't dare.

944
01:29:03,026 --> 01:29:04,314
I'm disappointed.

945
01:29:05,744 --> 01:29:09,783
I never expected my daughter 
to run away from her husband.

946
01:29:10,229 --> 01:29:12,579
Father, can't you understand 
that I'm afraid!

947
01:29:15,549 --> 01:29:17,736
I don't dare go to sleep at night.

948
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,893
She makes me want to scream.

949
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:23,377
I don't want to hear
about such things.

950
01:29:25,438 --> 01:29:28,080
Who can I turn to,
if even you won't listen to me?

951
01:29:30,049 --> 01:29:31,564
That's not the point.

952
01:29:32,182 --> 01:29:34,596
A woman is to stay 
with her husband.

953
01:29:35,342 --> 01:29:36,393
That's the law.

954
01:29:37,158 --> 01:29:39,002
What am I to do?!

955
01:29:39,826 --> 01:29:41,846
My husband's not human!

956
01:29:45,938 --> 01:29:48,572
You go back home 
to him now, my child.

957
01:29:49,525 --> 01:29:51,533
I've promised that 
there'll be a move.

958
01:29:52,049 --> 01:29:54,822
I'll keep that promise.
That I shall.

959
01:29:56,236 --> 01:30:00,174
You'll get away from that woman,
and live in peace with your husband.

960
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:06,002
But until that happens, 
you simply must stick it out.

961
01:30:07,385 --> 01:30:09,260
I'll try, Father.

962
01:30:10,854 --> 01:30:12,466
No tears, now!

963
01:30:13,502 --> 01:30:15,486
You're the one 
with the upper hand...

964
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:17,393
Don't forget that.

965
01:30:17,783 --> 01:30:19,104
No, Father.

966
01:30:37,854 --> 01:30:38,611
Where is she?

967
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:39,986
At the Hansson's.

968
01:30:42,073 --> 01:30:43,697
She's there all the time lately.

969
01:30:47,229 --> 01:30:48,299
Tomorrow...

970
01:30:53,354 --> 01:30:55,877
Tomorrow I have to go and look 
at that Albo property.

971
01:30:57,479 --> 01:30:58,705
What are you thinking?

972
01:30:59,174 --> 01:31:01,010
I'm going to be 
in debt to him forever.

973
01:31:02,518 --> 01:31:03,846
There's got to be 
a way around it.

974
01:31:05,619 --> 01:31:08,322
Grave-Karna... She can help you.
Go see Grave-Karna.

975
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,854
That's no good.

976
01:31:11,408 --> 01:31:15,369
Then everyone in the district thinks 
I need to see her, to sleep with my wife.

977
01:31:18,049 --> 01:31:19,541
I just want to live here 
with you.

978
01:31:19,635 --> 01:31:20,744
It can't happen.

979
01:31:21,362 --> 01:31:22,635
Don't you understand?!

980
01:31:23,484 --> 01:31:24,885
We have no choice.

981
01:31:31,646 --> 01:31:32,466
Per...

982
01:31:33,649 --> 01:31:34,791
...dearest...

983
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:36,885
Let me be!

984
01:31:37,322 --> 01:31:38,611
Don't nag me...

985
01:31:39,236 --> 01:31:40,299
Get away.

986
01:31:41,938 --> 01:31:43,072
Get away!

987
01:32:08,893 --> 01:32:09,854
Mother...

988
01:32:18,564 --> 01:32:20,549
When shall I get 
to live with you again?

989
01:32:25,688 --> 01:32:28,346
When can we be together 
like before?

990
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:31,924
Just keep calm.

991
01:32:32,674 --> 01:32:34,549
Laugh and be happy.

992
01:32:38,312 --> 01:32:40,604
It'll never be the same again.

993
01:32:42,432 --> 01:32:45,049
Yes it will, darling boy of mine.

994
01:32:46,271 --> 01:32:47,822
It'll be the same again.

995
01:32:49,713 --> 01:32:51,580
We must be patient.

996
01:32:54,063 --> 01:32:57,275
If we're both not to be destroyed,
listen to what I say.

997
01:33:00,188 --> 01:33:02,229
You have to be patient.

998
01:33:07,563 --> 01:33:08,689
Do you promise?

999
01:33:09,174 --> 01:33:10,408
Yes, I promise.

1000
01:33:13,002 --> 01:33:14,252
If I could trust you...

1001
01:33:14,416 --> 01:33:16,213
Of course you can trust me.

1002
01:33:22,146 --> 01:33:23,338
Come on Mother...

1003
01:33:26,775 --> 01:33:28,174
Forget everything.

1004
01:33:28,416 --> 01:33:29,947
I want us joined together.

1005
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:31,924
Come on now!

1006
01:33:34,521 --> 01:33:35,334
What about Hanna?

1007
01:33:35,682 --> 01:33:37,674
She won't be back 
for hours.

1008
01:33:38,307 --> 01:33:39,385
Come on!

1009
01:34:44,812 --> 01:34:46,171
Where have you been?

1010
01:34:51,249 --> 01:34:53,491
It's too late to be running around 
at night.

1011
01:34:54,335 --> 01:34:56,272
What have you been out 
gossiping about?

1012
01:34:57,694 --> 01:34:59,514
Only about what is true.

1013
01:34:59,936 --> 01:35:01,053
True about what?

1014
01:35:02,093 --> 01:35:03,694
You'd be the best judge of that.

1015
01:35:09,521 --> 01:35:10,772
Where have you been?

1016
01:35:12,835 --> 01:35:14,850
At Ola Svensson's 
if you must know.

1017
01:35:15,104 --> 01:35:16,749
What did you talk about there?

1018
01:35:19,979 --> 01:35:21,725
About the saw-logs 
of course...

1019
01:35:21,928 --> 01:35:23,757
....that Ola will be helping you with 
in the morning.

1020
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:25,116
And...?

1021
01:35:26,133 --> 01:35:27,452
What else did you say?

1022
01:35:29,077 --> 01:35:31,100
- None of your business.
- What more did you say?

1023
01:35:31,576 --> 01:35:32,960
Nothing!
Let go of me!

1024
01:35:33,015 --> 01:35:34,288
You watch out!

1025
01:35:35,022 --> 01:35:37,289
Running around gossiping 
can be dangerous!

1026
01:35:37,905 --> 01:35:39,585
I'm not afraid of you!

1027
01:35:41,148 --> 01:35:42,428
I was told.

1028
01:35:43,390 --> 01:35:45,390
Now I know enough 
for sure.

1029
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:48,553
Mother and father are coming tomorrow,
and soon we'll be far from here.

1030
01:35:48,729 --> 01:35:50,296
And if I don't move?

1031
01:35:50,413 --> 01:35:52,046
What else can you do?

1032
01:35:54,188 --> 01:35:57,382
I can tell Father about you 
and your mother.

1033
01:36:01,202 --> 01:36:03,428
He can have you both locked up!

1034
01:36:03,687 --> 01:36:05,194
Tomorrow's too late.

1035
01:36:07,186 --> 01:36:09,132
I can answer for myself...

1036
01:36:09,788 --> 01:36:11,014
...but not for Per.

1037
01:36:11,874 --> 01:36:13,483
He's unable to resist 
any longer.

1038
01:36:13,976 --> 01:36:15,561
He can break at any moment.

1039
01:36:16,710 --> 01:36:18,139
Tell him to come here.

1040
01:36:19,397 --> 01:36:21,749
I can't help someone 
who doesn't want to be helped.

1041
01:36:27,479 --> 01:36:30,155
You two don't want to be helped.

1042
01:36:32,475 --> 01:36:34,585
You just want things 
your own way.

1043
01:37:03,938 --> 01:37:05,639
I have to trust you.

1044
01:37:13,188 --> 01:37:14,421
Where are you going?

1045
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:18,632
Where are you going?

1046
01:37:19,354 --> 01:37:21,155
To see to the cattle.

1047
01:37:23,521 --> 01:37:24,460
Per...

1048
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:27,819
Don't go!

1049
01:37:31,812 --> 01:37:33,178
I don't want to be alone.

1050
01:37:33,491 --> 01:37:34,296
Why's that?

1051
01:37:36,303 --> 01:37:37,326
Your mother's here.

1052
01:37:38,327 --> 01:37:40,319
- She's here to kill me.
- Stop that!

1053
01:37:40,843 --> 01:37:42,163
I don't want to have to 
listen to that!

1054
01:37:42,240 --> 01:37:45,490
I know... I don't want 
that you two do it together!

1055
01:38:10,104 --> 01:38:11,257
Mother?

1056
01:38:17,396 --> 01:38:19,358
What are you doing here 
in the middle of the night?

1057
01:38:19,895 --> 01:38:20,928
I had a foreboding.

1058
01:38:22,225 --> 01:38:23,202
I was afraid...

1059
01:38:24,562 --> 01:38:26,264
Afraid of what you might do.

1060
01:38:27,335 --> 01:38:28,585
I've done nothing.

1061
01:38:29,843 --> 01:38:31,319
I saw Grave-Karna....

1062
01:38:32,671 --> 01:38:35,030
I couldn't think what to do.

1063
01:38:35,952 --> 01:38:38,671
All she could say 
was to be patient.

1064
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:40,097
I'm not doing anything.

1065
01:38:40,522 --> 01:38:41,585
I don't trust you.

1066
01:38:42,054 --> 01:38:43,600
I'm not doing what you said.

1067
01:38:49,604 --> 01:38:50,928
I'll stay here tonight.

1068
01:38:51,585 --> 01:38:52,663
As you wish.

1069
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:27,424
Per...

1070
01:39:29,146 --> 01:39:31,393
Why is it so hard 
for you to like me?

1071
01:39:34,146 --> 01:39:35,768
Why wouldn't I do as
well as your mother?

1072
01:39:35,877 --> 01:39:37,057
Aren't I prettier?

1073
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:41,400
As soon as we get away from here,
everything will be good, you'll see.

1074
01:39:41,846 --> 01:39:43,846
You'll soon forget her completely.

1075
01:39:45,771 --> 01:39:47,182
Let me be yours tonight.

1076
01:39:47,479 --> 01:39:48,729
I can't stand this any longer!

1077
01:39:48,807 --> 01:39:50,455
You say nothing 
and turn your back on me.

1078
01:39:50,565 --> 01:39:52,314
After all, I'm your wife!

1079
01:39:53,979 --> 01:39:55,174
Look at me .

1080
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:56,744
Look at me.

1081
01:39:56,986 --> 01:39:58,596
Come into me.

1082
01:39:58,737 --> 01:40:00,283
Come into me!

1083
01:40:00,643 --> 01:40:02,359
Do it, and I'll say nothing 
to Father.

1084
01:40:16,221 --> 01:40:18,416
Make her quiet before she wakes 
the whole neighbourhood.

1085
01:40:20,771 --> 01:40:22,080
Be quiet!

1086
01:41:07,729 --> 01:41:08,916
Is she dead?

1087
01:41:10,064 --> 01:41:11,150
I don't know.

1088
01:41:23,229 --> 01:41:24,551
She's breathing.

1089
01:41:27,127 --> 01:41:29,189
Tomorrow, everyone will know.

1090
01:42:20,455 --> 01:42:22,400
Now she won't tell anyone anything.

1091
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,627
You can relax.

1092
01:42:28,312 --> 01:42:29,800
She's alive.

1093
01:42:30,666 --> 01:42:32,502
Jesus, what'll we do?

1094
01:42:32,619 --> 01:42:33,549
Calm down.

1095
01:42:45,104 --> 01:42:46,533
No she's still.

1096
01:42:51,521 --> 01:42:53,111
We'll go to prison.

1097
01:42:56,729 --> 01:42:58,455
Not if you listen to me.

1098
01:42:59,549 --> 01:43:00,939
Do as I say.

1099
01:43:02,049 --> 01:43:03,189
Alright...

1100
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,658
I'll do exactly what you say.

1101
01:43:08,771 --> 01:43:11,025
I'll never go against you.

1102
01:43:18,021 --> 01:43:19,369
It's amazing...

1103
01:43:22,252 --> 01:43:23,682
I'm almost happy.

1104
01:43:27,146 --> 01:43:28,916
Now it's just you 
and me again.

1105
01:43:45,562 --> 01:43:48,104
The sentence for each one...

1106
01:43:49,072 --> 01:43:50,790
Anna Mansdotter is sentenced...

1107
01:43:50,938 --> 01:43:53,471
...for incest, to life with hard labour...

1108
01:43:53,719 --> 01:43:56,064
...and for murder, to be put to death.

1109
01:43:56,963 --> 01:44:01,947
Per Nilsson, for incest, 
4 years hard labour...

1110
01:44:02,174 --> 01:44:05,877
..and for murder,
to be put to death.

1111
01:44:09,229 --> 01:44:11,963
I bring some relief to your suffering, 
my child.

1112
01:44:12,948 --> 01:44:14,948
A veritable message from God...

1113
01:44:15,432 --> 01:44:18,332
A wonderful piece of news.

1114
01:44:20,596 --> 01:44:22,596
A light to your darkness.

1115
01:44:23,112 --> 01:44:24,439
It's about your son.

1116
01:44:25,104 --> 01:44:27,134
He has won his appeal.

1117
01:44:27,447 --> 01:44:29,385
He's avoided the death sentence.

1118
01:44:34,354 --> 01:44:35,314
Him?

1119
01:44:37,807 --> 01:44:39,080
Only him?!

1120
01:44:41,205 --> 01:44:42,044
Yes.

1121
01:44:43,312 --> 01:44:47,627
The village folk felt convinced 
of his innocence.

1122
01:44:53,938 --> 01:44:57,338
They know Per for his
open, friendly nature...

1123
01:44:57,486 --> 01:45:01,182
...and no one could believe
that he could have been involved.

1124
01:45:03,146 --> 01:45:04,400
The village folk...

1125
01:45:08,229 --> 01:45:11,643
The village folk sentence and acquit.

1126
01:45:14,021 --> 01:45:15,572
The village folk...

1127
01:45:17,813 --> 01:45:19,682
That's divine justice for you.

1128
01:45:22,549 --> 01:45:25,033
The village's favour, 
or the village's hate.

1129
01:45:27,229 --> 01:45:29,354
Is that what decides 
between life and death?

1130
01:45:31,729 --> 01:45:33,049
Is that justice?

1131
01:45:35,752 --> 01:45:36,807
Answer that for me.

1132
01:45:37,447 --> 01:45:40,346
Aren't you glad your son's life
has been spared?

1133
01:45:40,768 --> 01:45:42,077
No!

1134
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:50,697
They could have spared him 
before we got this far.

1135
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,479
But it was me.

1136
01:45:55,643 --> 01:45:58,057
I was the only one 
who gave him that love...

1137
01:46:00,025 --> 01:46:01,782
That love that he needed.

1138
01:46:02,807 --> 01:46:04,697
Not the one that 
others decided on.

1139
01:46:07,479 --> 01:46:09,682
I was the one 
who protected him...

1140
01:46:11,853 --> 01:46:13,080
...against God...

1141
01:46:13,821 --> 01:46:15,721
...who took my other children
 from me...

1142
01:46:17,688 --> 01:46:22,197
...who for all her crimes 
shall lose her life...

1143
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:28,275
...having forfeited for all time,
all rights as a citizen.

1144
01:46:41,521 --> 01:46:43,286
The time has come, my child.

1145
01:48:47,521 --> 01:48:49,066
Push her head down.

1146
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:46,858
It was a bit crooked...
not my fault.

1147
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:48,616
She lifted her head
at the last moment.

1148
01:49:49,366 --> 01:49:50,578
You saw that didn't you, Pastor?

1149
01:49:52,479 --> 01:49:53,749
She repented.

1150
01:49:55,155 --> 01:49:56,546
So she wept.

1151
01:49:58,061 --> 01:50:00,202
I'm sure she repented.

1152
01:51:29,256 --> 01:51:32,593
