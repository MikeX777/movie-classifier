1
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,807
(dramatic orchestral music)

2
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:29,612
(tense orchestral music)

3
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:23,726
(dramatic orchestral music)

4
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,810
(audience cheering)

5
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,816
- Bravo, bravo.

6
00:04:41,822 --> 00:04:43,574
- Splendid, as always.

7
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:47,244
I could watch you dance forever.

8
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,708
Don't, stay with me.

9
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,647
Why go back to Russia?

10
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:01,842
- Do you know what they
do to family of defectors?

11
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,832
- I love you, Svetlana.

12
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:16,857
Please stay.

13
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,195
Together we could revolutionize dance.

14
00:05:23,572 --> 00:05:27,511
- You're a great American choreographer,

15
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,387
and I love you.

16
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,455
I cannot stay in America.

17
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,434
I go home tomorrow.

18
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,458
- No.

19
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:50,014
- Tony.

20
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:00,109
(tire squealing)

21
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,581
- Svetlana.

22
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,565
- Ladies?

23
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:23,048
Ladies, your attention please.

24
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,486
Mister Wagner?

25
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,510
- Thank you.

26
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,032
I'd like to welcome you
to Madame Gordenko's

27
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,617
academy of dance.

28
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:35,078
This is the first time the
authorities have allowed girls

29
00:06:35,102 --> 00:06:38,039
from outside the Soviet Union to attend.

30
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:41,835
I have been trying to
accomplish this for many years.

31
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,422
Therefore, I shall expect quite a lot.

32
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,740
(screaming)

33
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,913
As I was saying,

34
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,726
I'm not promising that Madame

35
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,397
can turn you into Anna
Pavlovas or Margo Fontaines,

36
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:04,649
at least not over night.

37
00:07:04,673 --> 00:07:07,319
As is the tradition of this academy,

38
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,472
one of you will audition for
the Petersburg Ballet Rus.

39
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,644
Which one will it be?

40
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,945
- Ladies, to your rooms please.

41
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,262
- That photographer from
the magazine is back again.

42
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:37,307
I thought I instructed
you to get rid of him.

43
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,291
- I'll ask him to leave.

44
00:07:49,134 --> 00:07:52,906
- As for our heat inspector,
I know him, I know him.

45
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,076
You must be Anthony Wagner, am I right?

46
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,370
I'm James Anderson.

47
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,145
You did get my cable?

48
00:08:01,021 --> 00:08:02,874
- I'm very sorry, Mister uh?

49
00:08:02,898 --> 00:08:03,793
- Anderson.

50
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,085
What's the matter with this country?

51
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,361
- Yes, won't you sit please?

52
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,658
I'm afraid I have no idea
what you're talking about.

53
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,679
- Jessica come down here would you?

54
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,931
- I'm really quite sorry Mister Anderson,

55
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:21,476
but our enrollment has been
filled for some time now,

56
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,770
and it's by invitation only.

57
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:28,650
As you can well imagine,
we have to be quite sure...

58
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,011
(eerie orchestral music)

59
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,089
- I love you Anthony.

60
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,740
- Then stay with me.

61
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,231
- Look Mister Wagner, I'm a man who's used

62
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:10,233
to getting what he wants,

63
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:13,611
and what I want is for Jessica
to attend your academy,

64
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:15,113
study under your Madame,

65
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,907
and to dance at the
Petersburg Ballet Company.

66
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:20,535
- I guess I have to
apologize for my father.

67
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,621
He thinks he can buy anything he wants to,

68
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,750
and I'm not about to go to
your Russian ballet school.

69
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:31,212
I don't want to be a prancing
old-fashioned prima ballerina.

70
00:09:31,236 --> 00:09:33,923
I loved ballet when I was a kid.

71
00:09:33,947 --> 00:09:37,052
Now I'm gonna dance the way I want to,

72
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,702
and it's not ballet.

73
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,349
- Svetlana.

74
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:03,453
Svetlana!

75
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,147
(dramatic orchestral music)

76
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,671
Svetlana.

77
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,481
- My daughter'll do as
I wish, Mister Wagner.

78
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,640
- I think maybe we are roommates.

79
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:06,999
- Yeah, I guess.

80
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,310
Where are you from?

81
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:10,937
- Paris.

82
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,272
You?

83
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,857
- Everywhere,

84
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,881
nowhere.

85
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,806
Guess this one's mine.

86
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,415
God, I have no idea what I'm doing here.

87
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,041
- How can you say that?

88
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:35,086
Do you know how many girls
would love to study with Madame?

89
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,840
She's famous, all over the continent.

90
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,885
We are honored to be the first outsiders...

91
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,829
- Don't tell me you're
one of Madame's groupies?

92
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,837
(somber orchestral music)

93
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,899
(girl screaming)

94
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:58,133
- What's going on up there?

95
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,639
(girl screaming)

96
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,583
What happened?

97
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,752
What is going on here?

98
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,776
Oh my God.

99
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,051
- No, it was a joke.

100
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,929
I was just kidding, look.

101
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:26,953
It's fake.

102
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,516
- Now, get up, get to your rooms.

103
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,726
Move it ladies, move it.

104
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,879
Now remember, we have to
get ready early tomorrow.

105
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,002
- I do hope, we are rid

106
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:19,172
of this journalist, pest Anthony.

107
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:26,680
- [Anthony] I instructed
Olga to get rid of him.

108
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,174
(whispering)

109
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,075
Don't scold me, Madame.

110
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,037
I have my reasons.

111
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,915
Her father was most persuasive.

112
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,508
Now, look at this photograph,

113
00:14:05,218 --> 00:14:09,348
and tell me what you think
of Miss Jessica Anderson.

114
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:16,956
- Ah, it is remarkable.

115
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,607
But, can she dance?

116
00:14:21,276 --> 00:14:24,488
- Why it's as if I had a second chance.

117
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:32,138
- Why do you think it would
have been any different,

118
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:34,790
if you had a second chance, hmm?

119
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,631
(giggling)

120
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:53,159
(knocking on door)

121
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,161
- Madame, may I come in?

122
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:55,996
- [Madame] Yah.

123
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,063
- [Anthony] Come in Olga.

124
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,660
(giggling)

125
00:15:17,874 --> 00:15:19,477
- Was that your famous Madame?

126
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,397
- Of course, didn't you
know they were lovers?

127
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,815
- Oh God, with that face?

128
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,775
- Oh no, not now.

129
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,904
Long ago, he was a great
American choreographer,

130
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:31,823
and most handsome.

131
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:35,243
Many years ago, Madame, she
was dancing in New York,

132
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,495
and she defected to America.

133
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,163
She returned to Russia years later,

134
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:41,290
after a terrible accident.

135
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:45,670
Some say he is to blame,
for keeping Madame.

136
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,612
Can I tell you a secret?

137
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,677
Some say they are still lovers.

138
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,995
- Oh God, with Olga to help.

139
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,522
(ominous orchestral music)

140
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,174
(heart beating)

141
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:54,554
(alarm clock ringing)

142
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:07,710
- Oh come on, we must go, we
get a good place at the bar.

143
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,338
- Ladies, pay attention please.

144
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,362
Let's begin.

145
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,159
E, one, two, three, four.

146
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,705
One, two, three, four.

147
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:25,102
- I haven't done this in four years.

148
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:27,003
- I did this yesterday.

149
00:17:29,422 --> 00:17:32,026
- Now, change position.

150
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,843
One, two, three, four.

151
00:17:36,137 --> 00:17:37,907
One, two.
- She's KGB.

152
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,700
- Three, four.

153
00:17:39,724 --> 00:17:41,744
Drop the hands softer.

154
00:17:41,768 --> 00:17:43,412
Three, four.

155
00:17:43,436 --> 00:17:45,230
One, two, three, four.

156
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,860
One, two, three, four.

157
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,965
All together, all together.

158
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,824
One, two, three, four.

159
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:16,261
- So, which of you wants
to be great dancer?

160
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,144
You, huh?

161
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,821
Now, I realize that some of you

162
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,802
prefer the rock and roll to the ballet.

163
00:18:39,826 --> 00:18:42,287
But not here, not in my class.

164
00:18:43,788 --> 00:18:45,099
No more.

165
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:47,626
- What the hell are you doing?

166
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,677
- The Petersburg Ballet Rus,

167
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:02,766
will be to accepting one of
my students for further study.

168
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,163
This provides fantastic opportunity,

169
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:11,834
to establish one's reputation
in the world of dance.

170
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:16,029
Now, who is willing to pay
the price for greatness?

171
00:19:18,698 --> 00:19:21,159
(piano music)

172
00:20:02,575 --> 00:20:04,494
Tres bien, mademoiselle.

173
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,580
Next.

174
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,543
- Me? I don't think so.

175
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:22,387
(piano music)

176
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,283
- Arch, arch.

177
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:49,914
Again, please.

178
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,844
I would like to see those
steps again, Miss Anderson.

179
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,393
Very well, next?

180
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:18,669
- Jessica, you're in over
your shit with Madame.

181
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:19,962
- You mean deep shit.

182
00:21:19,986 --> 00:21:21,464
- That too.

183
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,048
You must show respect for her.

184
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:25,468
She's a great teacher.

185
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,720
- That may be, but she
doesn't have to be rude.

186
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,763
- Rude?

187
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:31,098
It was you who was rude.

188
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,684
Jessica, you can be a wonderful dancer.

189
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:35,352
I will help you.

190
00:21:35,376 --> 00:21:38,439
- Thanks, but I don't think so.

191
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,523
What is it about this place?

192
00:21:39,547 --> 00:21:42,276
Doesn't it ever get dark around here?

193
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,405
- No, not this time of year,
because we are so far north.

194
00:21:46,429 --> 00:21:48,699
It's called white nights.

195
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:51,518
The sun sets for maybe 30 minutes.

196
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,895
- What's that?

197
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:58,942
(ominous orchestral music)

198
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,154
Hello?

199
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,658
Anybody here?

200
00:22:12,121 --> 00:22:14,725
- May I help you Miss Anderson?

201
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,103
- Oh, am I not supposed to be here?

202
00:22:18,127 --> 00:22:20,606
- No no, that's quite all right.

203
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,942
You looking for something?

204
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:25,110
- No, I was just curious I guess.

205
00:22:25,134 --> 00:22:26,695
- Ah, well, you know what

206
00:22:26,719 --> 00:22:29,681
curiosity did to the cat, don't you?

207
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,411
- Jessica, are you all right?

208
00:22:34,435 --> 00:22:36,372
- Yeah, I'm fine.

209
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,457
- I don't usually allow visitors,

210
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:41,609
but would you two like to step inside?

211
00:22:43,194 --> 00:22:46,966
I think I have some juice you might enjoy.

212
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:51,887
And perhaps you will indulge
me if I have a little vodka?

213
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:52,912
Here we are.

214
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:59,562
I heard about your little
problem with Madame today.

215
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,314
- Jessica is a wonderful dancer.

216
00:23:02,338 --> 00:23:05,800
- All the great ballerinas were brunettes,

217
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,678
like Claudine here.

218
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:14,017
Have you ever considered
changing your hairstyle?

219
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:16,811
Or perhaps the color?

220
00:23:19,522 --> 00:23:22,126
- I told you I don't want to
be a ballerina, all right?

221
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,693
Claudine, let's go.

222
00:23:38,374 --> 00:23:41,020
- [Claudine] Come on,
we've got to do this.

223
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:45,858
- I know, but I told you this
ballet stuff suffocates me.

224
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,800
And Claudine, Claudine,

225
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:53,198
no matter what, I'm not
changing my hair color.

226
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:56,702
- I agree, but I'm not
letting my new American friend

227
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,187
be humiliated by Madame again.

228
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:05,169
(Olga speaking in foreign language)

229
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,404
- Nyet Olga, English, we must to speak.

230
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,425
English our students from west

231
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,178
are attending our academy, understood?

232
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:18,974
- Yes, of course, but the
academy will never be the same

233
00:24:18,998 --> 00:24:20,458
this new students.

234
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,481
- Nonsense, students from the west

235
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:28,817
could only enhance the
reputation of my academy,

236
00:24:28,841 --> 00:24:30,301
so I have learned.

237
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,890
- Other side, okay?

238
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:39,769
Up and up and.

239
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:45,918
Your shoulder, your arms,
here, yes that's it,

240
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,878
that's it, like that.

241
00:24:47,902 --> 00:24:49,696
More, that's it, okay?

242
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,515
I think you're hiding out, yes, okay?

243
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,976
- You go ahead, I need
to work at this thing.

244
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,185
- I could stay and help you.

245
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,019
- No.

246
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:04,854
- Are you sure?

247
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,838
- It's my thing, thanks.

248
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,275
- I'll be in the spa.

249
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:11,111
- That sounds great.

250
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:13,070
I'll meet you in a bit.

251
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,094
- Okay.

252
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:48,254
(rock music)

253
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:02,560
71 got a feeling that
something's starting

254
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:07,106
(eerie music)

255
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,014
77 And feel the heat on me

256
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,850
7 Gonna get my body moving

257
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,061
7 And set it free

258
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:30,064
7 I'm gonna turn it out

259
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:33,484
3 Gonna take that hammer down in my soul

260
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,637
3 And take my chances and lose control

261
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,320
(rock music)

262
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:06,833
(tense orchestral music)

263
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,047
(rock music)

264
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,562
(rock music)

265
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:23,284
(heart beating)

266
00:28:26,495 --> 00:28:28,331
- Jessica, is that you?

267
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,169
(rock music)

268
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:44,138
(heart beating)

269
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,932
Who's there?

270
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,207
Come on guys, it's not funny.

271
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,816
(heart beating)

272
00:28:58,277 --> 00:29:01,030
Angela, is this one of your jokes?

273
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:08,805
Look, if someone's there,
say something, please.

274
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:11,207
(rock music)

275
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,088
(heart beating)

276
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,596
(screaming)

277
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,996
Why are you doing this?

278
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:45,277
- Claudine?

279
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,635
Are you in here?

280
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,012
Claudine?

281
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:52,932
Claudine?

282
00:30:58,105 --> 00:30:59,105
Claudine?

283
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,361
Claudine, are you in here?

284
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
Claudine?

285
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,456
- Hello?

286
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,669
How's the water?

287
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,090
- Hi, what are you doing here?

288
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:26,132
- Warm, huh?

289
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:30,072
Do you want to get wet with me?

290
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,740
- Who are you?

291
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,408
Where's Claudine?

292
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:34,493
- Who's Claudine?

293
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,852
- Do you work here, or what?

294
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:39,397
- She like bubbles?

295
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,627
- You didn't answer my question.

296
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,922
- So, you don't want to get wet with me?

297
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,946
That's cool.

298
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,678
- Hey you, wait up.

299
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,180
- What?

300
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,372
More questions?

301
00:31:58,582 --> 00:32:02,562
All right, Alexander Dugrov,
Moscow Ballet Magazine.

302
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,606
- Am I supposed to be impressed?

303
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,233
- I hope not.

304
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:09,569
- So, what do you do for
fun in this mausoleum?

305
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:12,823
- Isn't it against regulations?

306
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,473
- Whose regulations?

307
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,476
Wait I'll change.

308
00:32:25,734 --> 00:32:28,863
(motorcycle starting)

309
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:50,735
(alarm clock ringing)

310
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:55,198
- Claudine, I met this
great guy last night.

311
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,534
I'll tell you about it later.

312
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:58,411
And thanks to you,

313
00:32:58,435 --> 00:33:01,896
I'm gonna show that Madame a thing or two.

314
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,443
She wouldn't have left.

315
00:33:09,695 --> 00:33:10,905
- Look at this.

316
00:33:14,783 --> 00:33:16,595
Three different fly times to Paris.

317
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,806
- It doesn't make any sense,
okay, she loved it here.

318
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,642
Look, she would never leave
without the music box.

319
00:33:22,666 --> 00:33:24,519
- What is that?

320
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:25,770
That's yours.

321
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:27,939
It is on your dresser, isn't it?

322
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:30,049
- It belongs to Claudine.

323
00:33:30,966 --> 00:33:34,261
- Well, then she must have forgotten it.

324
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,615
- She wouldn't ever.

325
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,742
- She's gone home, Miss Anderson,

326
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:41,477
and that's all there is about it.

327
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:47,042
Her parents will have to be informed.

328
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:51,213
And by the way, your class
begins in 20 minutes.

329
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,715
You'd better get dressed young lady,

330
00:33:53,739 --> 00:33:55,241
and don't be late.

331
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,962
(piano music)

332
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:20,599
You're late, come here.

333
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,119
Listen, I was right.

334
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:25,664
You don't know your friend
as well as you thought.

335
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,083
Her parents informed us
about some boy from Paris,

336
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,626
who got in some trouble with the police,

337
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,127
and I guess she wanted to be with him

338
00:34:31,151 --> 00:34:33,129
more than she wanted to be here.

339
00:34:33,153 --> 00:34:34,965
- Claudine never mentioned a boy...

340
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,031
- She's gone.

341
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,718
Now, get warmed up.

342
00:34:38,742 --> 00:34:41,245
Madame will be here any moment.

343
00:34:43,747 --> 00:34:46,166
(piano music)

344
00:35:09,189 --> 00:35:12,568
- You're not working hard enough Jessica.

345
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,519
You're still too much thinking.

346
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,522
I think that your steps,

347
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:55,253
it is like looking at great portraits,

348
00:35:55,277 --> 00:35:57,088
and knowing it is forgery.

349
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:59,615
You must to hide the mechanics.

350
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,136
Hmm?

351
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Yeah?

352
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,793
(giggling)

353
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,689
(hands clapping)

354
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:17,609
- Girls, we've got still work to do.

355
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,009
Get to your bars.

356
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:24,765
(piano music)

357
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,936
- Notice how Angela's work

358
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,838
has an apparently seamless quality.

359
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,860
Olga, ask Miss Anderson to come forward.

360
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:03,721
- Miss Anderson, come here please.

361
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:11,603
- I would like for you to
perform the variation again.

362
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,273
This time, together.

363
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,669
- Madame, I don't think
that's really fair.

364
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,088
I mean, I don't know the
variation of the music.

365
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:21,947
- Fair, Miss Anderson?

366
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,093
Dance.

367
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,578
(piano music)

368
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,816
Bravo, Angela, exquisite.

369
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:19,022
I told you the American girl had talent.

370
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:22,817
- Yes, of course, Madame,
you were right as always.

371
00:38:22,841 --> 00:38:26,529
Tell Mister Wagner to
come here immediately.

372
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:29,199
- Ah, I believe he's
not available right now.

373
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,350
- Just, to bring him here.

374
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,519
- Of course.

375
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:36,290
- Do you understand?

376
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,940
- Yes, I understand.

377
00:38:44,571 --> 00:38:47,533
(music box playing)

378
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:58,585
(romantic orchestral music)

379
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,670
- Hello?

380
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:51,364
- You scared me.

381
00:39:51,388 --> 00:39:53,324
- Are you okay?

382
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:54,975
- Yes, yes I'm okay.

383
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,955
- [Jessica] Where'd you get the music?

384
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,542
- I don't know, something I picked up.

385
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,669
It's just good to dance to.

386
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,255
- Claudine uses that music.

387
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:08,381
- Who is Claudine?

388
00:40:08,405 --> 00:40:10,967
- My friend from Paris.

389
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,452
They say she left the academy.

390
00:40:28,842 --> 00:40:30,010
- You want one?

391
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:32,011
- No thanks.

392
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:37,035
- We all have our little vices.

393
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,913
I would be lost without my little friends.

394
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,873
They help me dance,

395
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,275
they give me that extra edge that I need.

396
00:40:47,152 --> 00:40:49,905
(classical music)

397
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,454
- Do you know that
Claudine's not here anymore?

398
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:23,105
- Olga mentioned it,

399
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:26,793
something about a boyfriend back in Paris?

400
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,753
- It's pure bullshit.

401
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:31,464
She would never leave without
saying something to me.

402
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:34,217
- What are you saying Jessica?

403
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,511
- Something's happened to her.

404
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,096
I just know it.

405
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,681
- I don't understand.

406
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:40,890
What happened?

407
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:43,834
- I don't know, just something bad.

408
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,315
- Well, I think your
imagination's run away a bit,

409
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,216
but I'll tell you what,

410
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,803
I'll look into it if you wish.

411
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,788
I understand you were
quite good in class today.

412
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,581
- All right, I guess,

413
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:08,543
until that bitch of a Madame
of yours got on my case.

414
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,671
I mean how am I supposed to
dance if I don't know the steps?

415
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,738
- Good point.

416
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:15,842
Maybe I could help.

417
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:18,803
We Yanks should stick together, hmm?

418
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,454
- Would you help me?

419
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:27,586
(dramatic orchestral music)

420
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:31,566
- Are you all right?

421
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,966
- Yeah, I'm fine.

422
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,779
- Look, if you really want to impress

423
00:42:36,803 --> 00:42:38,614
the Petersburg judges,

424
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:41,909
you must dance in a style they understand.

425
00:42:41,933 --> 00:42:43,619
What you're doing is nice,

426
00:42:43,643 --> 00:42:46,563
but you need to be more traditional,

427
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,834
more of what they expect to see.

428
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,919
- I know, I'm not trying
to impress the Petersburg,

429
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:55,131
I just want to get through class.

430
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,549
- Svetlana.

431
00:42:56,573 --> 00:42:57,573
- What?

432
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,663
- Nothing, I was just thinking of Madame.

433
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,685
Well, we should be getting back to work.

434
00:43:07,709 --> 00:43:11,481
You have a lot of competition
from a lady from London.

435
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,940
- I know.

436
00:43:12,964 --> 00:43:13,964
- And.

437
00:43:19,137 --> 00:43:21,240
- One, two, three, four.

438
00:43:21,264 --> 00:43:23,534
One, two, three, four.

439
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:25,787
One, two, three, four.

440
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,081
One, two, three, four.

441
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,333
One, two, three, four.

442
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:32,627
One, two, three, four.

443
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:34,962
One, two, three, four.

444
00:43:34,986 --> 00:43:36,780
One, two, three, four.

445
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:45,664
- You must to be the
condition of Olympic athlete,

446
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,000
to be good dancer.

447
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,065
Now, Olga just told me you've
worked very hard this week.

448
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,591
Therefore, a special privilege.

449
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,862
The Saint Petersburg Ballet Rus

450
00:43:59,886 --> 00:44:03,241
has been kind enough to allow
us the use of their stage

451
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:05,225
for our lesson tomorrow.

452
00:44:06,351 --> 00:44:09,980
And use of their male
dancers, to assist us.

453
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,151
- Men.

454
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,657
(bright orchestral music)

455
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,960
(stage murmuring)

456
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,117
- What are you doing?

457
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:29,702
You may wait in the wings.

458
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:32,246
- I was just wondering if it was a sock,

459
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,730
or if it was real.

460
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:37,651
- It's disgusting, it's disgusting.

461
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:42,506
I'm not going to stand here
and to watch you hoodlums

462
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,283
defile the ballet with your filth.

463
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:52,707
(eerie music)

464
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,873
- Who's there?

465
00:46:45,343 --> 00:46:47,071
Come on you guys.

466
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,116
(heart beating)

467
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,599
You can't fool me.

468
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:56,914
It's Angela, remember?

469
00:46:56,938 --> 00:46:59,566
(heart beating)

470
00:47:34,642 --> 00:47:38,021
(tense orchestral music)

471
00:48:48,466 --> 00:48:50,945
- We must return to the academy.

472
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,154
Come girls.

473
00:48:52,178 --> 00:48:53,888
- I'll go get Angela.

474
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:02,062
Angela?

475
00:49:05,066 --> 00:49:08,027
Angela, Madame says it's time to go.

476
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,076
Angela, are you kidding around?

477
00:49:17,787 --> 00:49:18,787
Angela?

478
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,924
Angela, is that you?

479
00:49:31,217 --> 00:49:32,217
Angela?

480
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,891
Angela, stop clowning around.

481
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,374
- What are you doing here?

482
00:49:45,398 --> 00:49:46,750
- Madame says it's time to go,

483
00:49:46,774 --> 00:49:48,294
I was looking for Angela.

484
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,378
Have you seen her?

485
00:49:49,402 --> 00:49:50,653
- No, I haven't.

486
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:55,801
I suppose she just left,
like your friend from Paris.

487
00:49:55,825 --> 00:49:58,179
You know sometimes I'm wondering,

488
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:01,498
is everything a sick joke for you girls.

489
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,504
- Where's Angela?

490
00:50:19,724 --> 00:50:20,494
- Jessica?

491
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:21,869
Psst, Jessica.

492
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,454
- What are you doing up there?

493
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:24,580
- Looking for you.

494
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,873
What are you doing here?

495
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:27,333
- I'm looking for Angela.

496
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,251
- We've gotta talk.

497
00:50:29,275 --> 00:50:30,961
Do you really think it's
some sort of coverup here?

498
00:50:30,985 --> 00:50:31,796
- Yes, I sure do.

499
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,297
They're just trying to
keep the school open.

500
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:35,716
Angela and Claudine
wouldn't just take off.

501
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:38,427
- Well maybe they did take
off, each with a boyfriend.

502
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:39,262
- Are you kidding?

503
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,346
This place is like a convent.

504
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,829
You're really hot.

505
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,266
- What about you?

506
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:45,643
Are you seeing anyone?

507
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,876
- No such luck.

508
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,688
- It's strange.

509
00:50:49,712 --> 00:50:51,297
- Someone's coming.

510
00:51:26,332 --> 00:51:29,752
- You shouldn't be out alone at this hour.

511
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,565
- I wasn't alone.

512
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,693
- I just wanted to make
certain you were safe.

513
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:39,738
How well do you know this magazine fellow?

514
00:51:39,762 --> 00:51:40,888
- Well enough.

515
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:44,618
- Great dancers need their rest,

516
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:47,312
if we are to revolutionize dance.

517
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:52,084
- I don't know about
revolutionizing anything.

518
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:56,279
I just want to get through
class tomorrow with Madame.

519
00:51:58,072 --> 00:52:00,241
It's a nice thought though.

520
00:52:01,492 --> 00:52:02,492
Good night.

521
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:17,133
- The authorities say, they
have no more information.

522
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,739
But, I cannot help but
to worry that something

523
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,973
has happened to our Angela.

524
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:28,978
Therefore, I must to be
considering canceling this session.

525
00:52:30,521 --> 00:52:33,792
- Angela wouldn't want us
to do that, I know her.

526
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:37,987
She's probably having a good
laugh about all this right now.

527
00:52:39,238 --> 00:52:41,467
She does love ballet,

528
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:44,178
and I am certain that
whatever she's doing,

529
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:46,347
she'll be back soon.

530
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:49,666
She wouldn't want us to change anything.

531
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:56,482
- Do you girls agree with Ingrid?

532
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,506
Yeah?

533
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,112
And so do 1.

534
00:53:02,136 --> 00:53:03,697
Our Angela will return.

535
00:53:03,721 --> 00:53:07,266
She's making a practical
joking on us, hmm?

536
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,497
Now, on to more pleasant thoughts then.

537
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,689
Today's lesson.

538
00:53:15,858 --> 00:53:18,319
(piano music)

539
00:53:37,046 --> 00:53:39,924
(class applauding)

540
00:53:43,052 --> 00:53:44,595
Very good, Natasha.

541
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:49,726
Because of strain, and concern for Angela,

542
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,604
I'm granting you second privilege.

543
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,585
Olga will chaperone you
to the city this night.

544
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:01,070
(disco music)

545
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,894
- Come on, let's get up here.

546
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:16,918
Come on.

547
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:21,841
<i>7 More than I should, we're
runnin' in my neighborhood</i>

548
00:54:24,343 --> 00:54:26,488
3 There's something back there new

549
00:54:26,512 --> 00:54:29,658
7 To take my mind off of you

550
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:32,685
7 Baby what did I do

551
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,233
- [Jessica] Come on.

552
00:54:43,237 --> 00:54:44,405
- Not a chance.

553
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:52,246
- Come on, get up here.

554
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,683
Come on.

555
00:54:54,707 --> 00:54:55,707
- No, no.

556
00:54:58,544 --> 00:54:59,544
- Come on.

557
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,510
- Tom, come on.

558
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,085
/7 Talkin' about things I
shouldn't be thinking of

559
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:25,238
7 Losing my reasoning

560
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:28,425
<i>7 I still think of you</i>

561
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:31,762
<i>I Because no one else will do</i>

562
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:34,497
7 Say I'm a fool

563
00:55:38,584 --> 00:55:39,895
- Look, Jessica,

564
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,731
Madame wouldn't approve of
you dancing with this man.

565
00:55:42,755 --> 00:55:45,651
- I dance with whoever I want.

566
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,552
- Look, watch me dance.

567
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:10,741
7 Baby I've got something for you

568
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,147
- How are you?

569
00:56:24,171 --> 00:56:25,171
- Just fine.

570
00:56:31,804 --> 00:56:35,117
- Ivan must leave for the
last train at the Metro.

571
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,910
- Oh, that's too bad.

572
00:56:36,934 --> 00:56:38,453
I really liked the way
you danced out there,

573
00:56:38,477 --> 00:56:39,812
especially that.

574
00:56:42,189 --> 00:56:43,900
- I'm gonna walk him.

575
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:51,216
And, cover for me with the gustapo, shhh.

576
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:55,012
I'll be back before Olga knows I'm gone.

577
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,036
Bye.

578
00:57:08,215 --> 00:57:10,027
- You're a pretty good dancer out there.

579
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:10,862
- Thanks.

580
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,572
- Sasha, the news and not the girl.

581
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,596
- Sorry.

582
00:57:15,806 --> 00:57:18,577
- You want something to do Alex?

583
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,788
- Okay, well, I have to leave right now.

584
00:57:21,812 --> 00:57:24,625
When's Olga taking you
back to the academy?

585
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,126
- I don't know, I'm not sure.

586
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,211
I don't know where she went, she's gone.

587
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:31,822
- Okay, I'll be back
as soon as I can, okay?

588
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,849
- This will make you feel better.

589
00:58:00,142 --> 00:58:01,745
- You don't need this, Ingrid.

590
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,769
Nobody does.

591
00:58:03,604 --> 00:58:07,441
You're a great dancer,
you, not the pills, you.

592
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:11,129
- You sound exactly like my parents.

593
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:13,256
- I'm your friend, Ingrid.

594
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,575
- These little friends, gives me energy.

595
00:58:21,872 --> 00:58:22,872
Let's dance.

596
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,960
- That was fun.

597
00:59:01,328 --> 00:59:02,705
See you tomorrow.

598
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:09,045
- Telephone me tomorrow.

599
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,007
Bye.

600
00:59:45,706 --> 00:59:48,000
(screaming)

601
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,427
(screaming)

602
01:00:09,396 --> 01:00:12,584
- So what happened to
your magazine friend?

603
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:15,545
Did he find somebody he likes better?

604
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:19,615
- Yeah, maybe he did, he's
been gone a long time.

605
01:00:20,574 --> 01:00:23,637
- Well girls, we're going home.

606
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,806
What's happened to Natasha?

607
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:27,099
I don't see her here.

608
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,519
- Natasha met a guy she
likes, she's walking him home.

609
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,586
- Madame will be furious.

610
01:01:22,511 --> 01:01:26,140
(dramatic orchestral music)

611
01:01:38,652 --> 01:01:40,839
- What are you doing here? Be quiet.

612
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,424
- I'm coming up.

613
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,633
- Are you crazy?

614
01:01:43,657 --> 01:01:45,034
- Yes, about you.

615
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:54,585
- Be careful.

616
01:02:00,424 --> 01:02:03,802
(tense orchestral music)

617
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:14,581
- [Madame] Anthony, have we
heard anything about Natasha?

618
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,066
- No, the police know nothing.

619
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:25,241
Girls have the west have no discipline.

620
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:35,376
Maybe it was unwise, letting
them come to the academy.

621
01:02:41,006 --> 01:02:42,006
Svetlana.

622
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,988
- Sorry.

623
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:50,408
Sorry I couldn't, sorry
I couldn't make it to the

624
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:51,868
club before you left,

625
01:02:51,892 --> 01:02:54,812
I had some business to take care of.

626
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,792
- Sure it wasn't some other girl?

627
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,816
- Girl, me?

628
01:03:00,901 --> 01:03:02,504
No.

629
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:03,946
- Okay, two rules.

630
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,616
One, you can't spend the night.

631
01:03:08,575 --> 01:03:12,579
And two, we're gonna have
to be quiet about this.

632
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:22,339
(eerie orchestral music)

633
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:52,328
- Jessica?
- Shhhh.

634
01:04:30,115 --> 01:04:33,243
(alarm clock ringing)

635
01:04:40,417 --> 01:04:41,478
- I'm gonna take a quick shower,

636
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,396
and then change before class begins, okay?

637
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,420
- All right.

638
01:05:18,163 --> 01:05:19,557
- We have to make this a quickie.

639
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:20,600
Go get the condom.

640
01:05:20,624 --> 01:05:21,624
- We ready.

641
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:37,242
- Jessica, I'm so sorry about last night.

642
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,934
I was so out of line.

643
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:44,481
I just wanted to tell you
that, may the best dancer win.

644
01:05:46,358 --> 01:05:47,358
- Thanks.

645
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:57,387
- So, what happened to
your boyfriend last night?

646
01:05:57,411 --> 01:06:00,723
- Oh, I think he had a good time.

647
01:06:00,747 --> 01:06:02,291
- [Anthony] Ladies?

648
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:06,170
- Girls, please, gather together.

649
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:11,734
- I have some very bad news.

650
01:06:11,758 --> 01:06:14,529
There was a terrible accident last night.

651
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:18,182
I'm sorry to report
that your friend Natasha

652
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:21,643
has been tragically killed.

653
01:06:25,397 --> 01:06:28,168
- What a minute, Angela
and Claudine are missing,

654
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:30,170
and now poor Natasha's dead?

655
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:33,339
- Obviously there will be no lesson today,

656
01:06:33,363 --> 01:06:35,365
Madame is far too upset.

657
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,888
I shall give your condolences
to Natasha's family.

658
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:43,248
Let's um, let's leave this to the police.

659
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:57,280
- Jessica, there's something
I'd like you to know.

660
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,557
About the pills, no more, no more drugs.

661
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,104
I threw them all away.

662
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:07,980
- Good girl.

663
01:07:12,986 --> 01:07:17,157
- Madame, Jessica will
audition for the Petersburg.

664
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,536
Isn't that wonderful news?

665
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:23,890
- Madame does not wish to discuss

666
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,100
your young American friend.

667
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:30,188
And besides, you're becoming
too fond of this American.

668
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:33,149
She's not the best dancer we have.

669
01:07:33,173 --> 01:07:36,760
This girl from Germany
is every bit as good.

670
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,782
- You may leave Olga.

671
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:43,868
Madame and I will discuss this in private.

672
01:07:43,892 --> 01:07:44,977
- As you wish.

673
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:15,090
(romantic orchestral music)

674
01:08:27,144 --> 01:08:29,730
(heart beating)

675
01:08:47,372 --> 01:08:49,958
(heart beating)

676
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:15,859
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be up here.

677
01:09:21,531 --> 01:09:23,426
What's wrong?

678
01:09:23,450 --> 01:09:26,078
(heart beating)

679
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,149
Why are you doing this?

680
01:09:38,173 --> 01:09:40,676
- Ingrid, did you really think

681
01:09:41,551 --> 01:09:44,429
you dance with the Petersburg, hmm?

682
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,098
Did you?

683
01:09:55,273 --> 01:09:57,484
(crashing)

684
01:10:04,449 --> 01:10:08,078
(dramatic orchestral music)

685
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:29,617
- Ingrid?

686
01:10:29,641 --> 01:10:31,935
(screaming)

687
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,105
Ingrid!

688
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:44,215
- Are you telling people it was suicide?

689
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:45,675
- There will be an official announcement.

690
01:10:45,699 --> 01:10:47,093
- Ingrid was my friend,
I'm not waiting for you

691
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:48,952
to concoct some story.

692
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:51,098
- Jessica, please.

693
01:10:51,122 --> 01:10:52,640
- She didn't write this.

694
01:10:52,664 --> 01:10:55,601
- We found it in her room, her
body was full of narcotics.

695
01:10:55,625 --> 01:10:56,894
- Uh uh, she stopped using.

696
01:10:56,918 --> 01:10:59,212
She didn't, she promised me.

697
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:27,091
- So, how many more
students have withdrawn?

698
01:11:27,115 --> 01:11:29,469
- I don't know, about 20.

699
01:11:29,493 --> 01:11:31,012
- And Jessica?

700
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,287
Is she staying?

701
01:11:35,248 --> 01:11:38,543
- Is the American girl all you think of?

702
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:44,942
- And just what does that mean?

703
01:11:44,966 --> 01:11:47,487
- Two girls missing, two girls dead.

704
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,655
All we care about is Jessica.

705
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:51,616
- Yes, that's right.

706
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,452
We must have someone represent the academy

707
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,745
at the Petersburg audition.

708
01:11:55,769 --> 01:11:57,705
Why not Jessica?

709
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:58,729
Hmm?

710
01:12:00,982 --> 01:12:02,752
- Wait a minute,

711
01:12:02,776 --> 01:12:06,798
Jessica is the best dancer
left at the academy.

712
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:10,676
And it looks like as if it was planned.

713
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,512
- Now what does that mean,

714
01:12:12,536 --> 01:12:15,014
that I planned to have
those poor girls killed,

715
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:17,725
that I arranged to have Jessica
get into the Petersburg?

716
01:12:17,749 --> 01:12:21,103
- No no no no no no, of
course not, of course not.

717
01:12:21,127 --> 01:12:23,815
I've been with you and Madame, you know,

718
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:27,217
and helped you with Madame much too long,

719
01:12:28,885 --> 01:12:31,531
to even consider such a thing.

720
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:32,931
No of course not.

721
01:12:34,057 --> 01:12:35,618
I was only meaning that Jessica

722
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:38,186
is the best dancer we have now.

723
01:12:40,146 --> 01:12:41,146
Right?

724
01:12:42,315 --> 01:12:43,315
That's all.

725
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:45,986
- Yes she is.

726
01:12:48,363 --> 01:12:49,656
She is the best.

727
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:52,741
Have

728
01:12:54,744 --> 01:12:57,581
Madame prepare herself, would you?

729
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:00,208
I must speak to her.

730
01:13:01,626 --> 01:13:04,754
- Yes, of course my dear, as you wish.

731
01:13:15,390 --> 01:13:16,390
- Alex?

732
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:23,105
Alex?

733
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:27,319
(tense orchestral music)

734
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,244
- Mister Dugrov?

735
01:14:19,579 --> 01:14:22,767
Do you really think you
can get away with this?

736
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,768
- What are you talking about?

737
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,019
Get away with what?

738
01:14:25,043 --> 01:14:27,605
- We'll just see what
the police have to say.

739
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:28,398
- What police?

740
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,942
Look, look I was just trying
to see what's going on.

741
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:32,133
- I understand.

742
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,529
What is this?

743
01:14:35,553 --> 01:14:36,680
- What's what?

744
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:46,690
- Relax, it's just play knife.

745
01:14:48,358 --> 01:14:49,877
You see?

746
01:14:49,901 --> 01:14:51,545
- You're crazy.

747
01:14:51,569 --> 01:14:53,965
- Yes I am, probably.

748
01:14:53,989 --> 01:14:55,758
It doesn't matter.

749
01:14:55,782 --> 01:14:59,387
I don't understand,
this belongs to Angela.

750
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:01,097
- [Alex] So?

751
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,373
- So, what is going on here?

752
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,085
- That's a good question.

753
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:13,425
Where are you going?

754
01:15:15,218 --> 01:15:16,511
What's in there?

755
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:20,098
- [Olga] Mister Wagner's things.

756
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:22,827
- Come on, we don't have all night.

757
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,769
- [Olga] I'm doing this.

758
01:15:27,147 --> 01:15:29,774
(door creaking)

759
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,406
- What's this?

760
01:15:41,494 --> 01:15:43,204
- Claudine's luggage.

761
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:56,050
Oh my God.

762
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,752
(door closing)

763
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:03,637
- Jessica.

764
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:05,120
- Olga, oh my God.

765
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,432
You killed them.

766
01:17:08,456 --> 01:17:09,309
- No.

767
01:17:09,333 --> 01:17:11,060
- You killed Angela,

768
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,144
Claudine.

769
01:17:12,168 --> 01:17:13,896
- No no, no Jessica.

770
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:14,939
- Alex, why?

771
01:17:14,963 --> 01:17:16,982
- You don't understand
what you're talking about.

772
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:17,859
- You're crazy.

773
01:17:17,883 --> 01:17:21,386
- No, it wasn't me
Jessica please, no wait.

774
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:27,225
Please Jessica, you don't
understand, I didn't do it.

775
01:17:46,786 --> 01:17:50,498
There's so much Jessica
you don't understand.

776
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,255
- My God, what's happened?

777
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,389
This can't be.

778
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:09,517
- I love you.

779
01:18:15,231 --> 01:18:16,774
Our secret is safe.

780
01:18:42,383 --> 01:18:45,279
- Of course it's your decision Jessica.

781
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,781
The academy's officially closed.

782
01:18:47,805 --> 01:18:49,992
The rest of the girls will
be gone by this afternoon.

783
01:18:50,016 --> 01:18:52,852
I understand if you wish to leave.

784
01:18:54,187 --> 01:18:56,123
- I want to go to Alex's funeral.

785
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:59,043
- I'm sorry, that's impossible.

786
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:03,255
His remains have been sent
to his family in Moscow,

787
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:04,989
the service is there.

788
01:19:07,825 --> 01:19:10,662
Jessica, listen to me for a moment.

789
01:19:11,704 --> 01:19:15,250
You must try to put
all of this behind you.

790
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:19,730
It's such a shame, you worked so hard,

791
01:19:19,754 --> 01:19:22,233
but I truly believe you could be accepted

792
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,984
by the Petersburg.

793
01:19:24,008 --> 01:19:26,111
- I want to stick with Madame.

794
01:19:26,135 --> 01:19:28,447
- Well I'm afraid all this business

795
01:19:28,471 --> 01:19:29,865
has been too much for her.

796
01:19:29,889 --> 01:19:34,245
She's confined to her
bed, and will see no one.

797
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:38,398
- I just can't believe how
crazy that Olga must have been.

798
01:19:39,565 --> 01:19:41,627
- Yes, tortured people in this world

799
01:19:41,651 --> 01:19:44,487
do things we may never understand.

800
01:19:46,155 --> 01:19:48,509
We should be discussing you Jessica.

801
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:51,178
Don't you think Alexander
would want you to

802
01:19:51,202 --> 01:19:54,098
take advantage of this opportunity?

803
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,975
- I suppose so.

804
01:19:55,999 --> 01:19:57,810
- It's up to you,

805
01:19:57,834 --> 01:20:01,921
but whatever you decide,
please, please let me help.

806
01:20:05,675 --> 01:20:07,302
I could prepare you,

807
01:20:09,178 --> 01:20:11,824
I could help you to
become prima ballerina,

808
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,410
off the Petersburg Ballet Rus,

809
01:20:14,434 --> 01:20:17,478
and Madame, Madame would be so proud.

810
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:22,733
- Okay.

811
01:20:25,903 --> 01:20:29,490
(ominous orchestral music)

812
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:47,175
- She's wonderful, she's fantastic,

813
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,552
just like you.

814
01:20:51,929 --> 01:20:53,473
Just like you were.

815
01:21:15,244 --> 01:21:16,704
You must trust us.

816
01:21:18,831 --> 01:21:22,377
We know what the
Petersburg is looking for.

817
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:33,364
- When do I get to see Madame?

818
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:34,573
How's she doing?

819
01:21:34,597 --> 01:21:36,408
- Oh, much much better.

820
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:39,435
I tell her your progress every night.

821
01:21:59,872 --> 01:22:01,874
Tomorrow, the Petersburg.

822
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,814
- You've been great Anthony.

823
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:08,607
When can I see Madame?

824
01:22:08,631 --> 01:22:11,926
I want to see her, please can I see her?

825
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,699
- Very well, I'll tell you what,

826
01:22:17,723 --> 01:22:20,411
you shower and get a bite to eat,

827
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:24,605
and I'll tell Madame you'll
be up at say, eight o'clock?

828
01:22:26,357 --> 01:22:29,735
And don't excite her too much, all right?

829
01:22:30,862 --> 01:22:31,798
- I won't, I just want to see her

830
01:22:31,822 --> 01:22:34,031
before tomorrow's audition.

831
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:43,767
Madame?

832
01:22:43,791 --> 01:22:45,018
It's Jessica.

833
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:46,169
May I come in?

834
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:50,422
Madame?

835
01:22:52,216 --> 01:22:53,111
Madame?

836
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:54,135
It's Jessica.

837
01:22:57,013 --> 01:23:00,975
Did Anthony tell you I'd
be coming this evening?

838
01:23:03,227 --> 01:23:04,854
How are you feeling?

839
01:23:06,522 --> 01:23:08,774
Tomorrow's the big audition.

840
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:15,632
I hope to make you proud of me.

841
01:23:15,656 --> 01:23:16,656
- Anthony,

842
01:23:18,075 --> 01:23:19,075
everything,

843
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:24,289
everything,

844
01:23:26,083 --> 01:23:27,083
Anthony,

845
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:30,629
Svetlana.

846
01:23:31,756 --> 01:23:32,756
- What?

847
01:23:33,925 --> 01:23:34,926
- Two of us.

848
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:37,761
Two of us.

849
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,140
Two of us.

850
01:23:43,559 --> 01:23:44,559
Two of us.

851
01:23:48,981 --> 01:23:49,981
- Anthony.

852
01:23:50,691 --> 01:23:51,691
Anthony?

853
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:56,673
Anthony?

854
01:23:56,697 --> 01:24:00,010
There's something wrong with Madame.

855
01:24:00,034 --> 01:24:01,034
Anthony?

856
01:24:08,543 --> 01:24:09,543
Anthony?

857
01:24:12,755 --> 01:24:13,755
Anthony?

858
01:24:19,053 --> 01:24:20,053
Anthony?

859
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:31,625
- [Madame] You will not
give that girl everything.

860
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:32,649
- Anthony?

861
01:24:35,611 --> 01:24:37,905
Madame, sorry to bother you.

862
01:24:42,493 --> 01:24:44,870
Do you know where Anthony is?

863
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:53,295
Madame?

864
01:24:59,093 --> 01:25:00,970
- You won't replace me.

865
01:25:30,082 --> 01:25:31,082
Please,

866
01:25:32,793 --> 01:25:33,793
Svetlana,

867
01:25:35,671 --> 01:25:37,548
don't make me use this.

868
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:02,239
You see, together,

869
01:26:04,867 --> 01:26:07,203
we could revolutionize dance.

870
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,708
It's not too late, my beautiful swan.

871
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:15,937
I thought I lost you,

872
01:26:15,961 --> 01:26:16,961
so long ago.

873
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:22,885
But you came back.

874
01:26:25,179 --> 01:26:26,722
I brought you back,

875
01:26:27,848 --> 01:26:28,974
as part of me.

876
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:35,940
It wasn't my fault.

877
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:39,211
No, it was an accident.

878
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:42,363
Oh yes yes yes yes yes I know, I know.

879
01:26:44,448 --> 01:26:45,574
You blamed me.

880
01:26:49,662 --> 01:26:51,014
You went away.

881
01:26:51,038 --> 01:26:52,038
No, no, no.

882
01:27:00,631 --> 01:27:01,631
And now,

883
01:27:02,758 --> 01:27:04,903
come back to me,

884
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:05,928
in the flesh.

885
01:27:07,138 --> 01:27:08,138
Forgive me,

886
01:27:09,932 --> 01:27:11,183
to dance for me.

887
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:14,645
But you will dance, yes.

888
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:18,983
You'll dance in the Petersburg Ballet Rus,

889
01:27:21,152 --> 01:27:24,196
because there's no one left to dance.

890
01:27:26,949 --> 01:27:29,952
You'll dance for me, my choregraphy,

891
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:34,957
together, we will revolutionize dance.

892
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:46,844
The world will only remember your glory,

893
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:50,222
not your pain.

894
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:12,452
- A dream.

895
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:15,122
A nightmare.

896
01:28:39,605 --> 01:28:41,774
To Svetlana, my beautiful,

897
01:28:43,651 --> 01:28:45,528
forever yours, Anthony.

898
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:50,365
No.

899
01:28:52,117 --> 01:28:55,037
(knocking on door)

900
01:28:56,372 --> 01:28:59,893
- Good morning, you have
one hour to get dressed,

901
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:03,420
and get ready for the Petersburg audition.

902
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,800
Svetlana?

903
01:29:11,053 --> 01:29:13,532
- You can't make me do this, Anthony.

904
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:14,807
I won't do this.

905
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:21,397
- Now now, we mustn't
disappoint Madame, must we?

906
01:29:22,815 --> 01:29:26,986
You're the only one left
to dance for the academy.

907
01:29:28,195 --> 01:29:29,488
Oh, what's this?

908
01:29:35,244 --> 01:29:37,663
I see you received my flowers.

909
01:29:44,879 --> 01:29:47,256
Don't disappoint me Svetlana.

910
01:29:52,052 --> 01:29:54,406
I can use this if I have to.

911
01:29:54,430 --> 01:29:57,641
- No, you won't have to use it Anthony.

912
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:01,645
Will Madame be coming to the audition?

913
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:08,944
- My dear Svetlana, you
don't understand do you?

914
01:30:11,113 --> 01:30:12,990
Madame wants to be you,

915
01:30:14,658 --> 01:30:16,035
and if she comes,

916
01:30:17,286 --> 01:30:18,621
she'll kill you.

917
01:30:30,507 --> 01:30:33,969
(gentle orchestral music)

918
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:38,200
(tense orchestral music)

919
01:31:49,878 --> 01:31:51,505
- I am not Svetlana.

920
01:32:10,607 --> 01:32:12,651
- Oh, stay away from her.

921
01:32:15,237 --> 01:32:16,864
Don't come near her.

922
01:32:18,907 --> 01:32:20,534
It's better for you.

923
01:32:24,621 --> 01:32:26,874
Stay away from my Svetlana.

924
01:32:34,923 --> 01:32:35,734
- Brava.

925
01:32:35,758 --> 01:32:36,758
- Grazzi.

926
01:32:58,322 --> 01:33:02,010
- You haven't got it, little bitch.

927
01:33:02,034 --> 01:33:04,453
You could never to replace me.

928
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:07,747
No, no.

929
01:33:11,043 --> 01:33:12,043
No.

930
01:33:16,298 --> 01:33:17,298
Svetlana.

931
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:21,928
I love you.

932
01:33:23,305 --> 01:33:26,975
(dramatic orchestral music)

933
01:33:46,495 --> 01:33:47,955
Svetlana, my love.

934
01:33:51,166 --> 01:33:52,543
You danced again.

935
01:33:56,004 --> 01:33:57,464
You danced for me.

936
01:34:21,738 --> 01:34:24,283
(bell ringing)

937
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:31,582
(dramatic orchestral music)
