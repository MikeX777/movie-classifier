1
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:50,341
- John Coltrane, he could
get in his spaceship

2
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:54,222
and it could take him
anywhere he wanted to go.

3
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,564
- Just to say the name John Coltrane,

4
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,909
it makes me shake, tremble.

5
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,528
It's like talking' about
Beethoven, Shakespeare.

6
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,702
You're talking' about an artistic genius

7
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,541
and a spiritual giant.

8
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,090
- Trane had a sound that was heavenly,

9
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:27,546
it was like, oh my God.

10
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,889
- Coltrane's strength of character

11
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,557
is in his journey through music.

12
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:40,559
He sacrificed.

13
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,357
And he had the insight
and the consciousness

14
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:47,278
to touch that thing that's
inside of all of us.

15
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,465
- Right now, we're gonna take you down

16
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,514
to a favorite little spot of ours

17
00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:16,978
here in New York, Cafe Bohemia.

18
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,268
Down there at the present time

19
00:02:18,269 --> 00:02:20,890
is a young man whose name is Miles Davis.

20
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:22,609
I'm sure you know who he is,

21
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,898
he's a real cool

22
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,272
stylist, Miles Davis is.

23
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:35,154
- 1957, John Coltrane is part of one

24
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,616
of the ground-breaking groups of the day,

25
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,618
the Miles Davis Quintet.

26
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:43,579
Miles Davis is looked
upon as the harbinger

27
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,957
of everything new.

28
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:48,135
He is on the cutting edge.

29
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,294
Everyone is looking at him

30
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:53,094
for the promise of what is to come.

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:01,097
- Are you really asking
me a question like that?

32
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,975
How good was that band?

33
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,734
- Well, I think it was probably one

34
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:11,734
of the greatest jazz bands
that was ever formed.

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,361
- Everybody in the band
had their own voice

36
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:19,583
and John was really, really
special in that regard,

37
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,832
in that you could hear that
he was going somewhere,

38
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:26,708
and I think that Miles heard
that he was going somewhere.

39
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:37,675
- Being with Miles Davis
was huge for Coltrane,

40
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:38,723
absolutely huge.

41
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:41,429
It catapulted him from being somebody

42
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:44,684
that only really serious
record collectors knew about

43
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:47,687
to being somebody that everybody knew.

44
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,689
- John Coltrane's experiences

45
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,692
in Miles Davis' Quintet was sort of

46
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:57,697
like going up to the high
diving board every night;

47
00:03:57,698 --> 00:04:00,165
allowing himself to be scared,

48
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,700
allowing himself to not know

49
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,703
exactly what was gonna be ahead of him.

50
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,706
- It's of a high, high caliber to be able

51
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:12,337
to play on the level which is exceptional.

52
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:14,839
You've got to be touched by

53
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:20,015
the supreme whatever to be
able to play like Miles played

54
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,104
and like Coltrane played.

55
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,647
- At this time, Coltrane
is a relative newlywed.

56
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,776
With the entire Miles
Davis Band as best men,

57
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,405
Coltrane marries Naima Austin,

58
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,248
a woman he'd met in Philadelphia.

59
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,747
Naima has a child, Antonia.

60
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:49,297
- This is a man who gets
his first experience

61
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,087
as fatherhood with me,

62
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,628
and I was a handful, little bit.

63
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,757
I was a handful.

64
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,763
I was remembering one time,

65
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:07,014
John had this gig, it was a bad night,

66
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,813
snowy, he did the gig.

67
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,904
I needed some shoes.

68
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,440
He walked back from that gig home

69
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,026
so he wouldn't spend any of the money

70
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,746
so that I could get
the shoes the next day.

71
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,498
You know, you make that sacrifice,

72
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,917
you work all night and then you walk home

73
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:32,540
so that I can get a pair of shoes?

74
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,758
That's father.

75
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,968
- John Coltrane is working consistently

76
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:42,007
to support the wife
and daughter he adores.

77
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,012
Life is good, but there's a problem.

78
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,078
- We are playing in nightclubs

79
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,825
where the pimps and hustlers are around

80
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:09,244
and you go for the hype,

81
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:12,580
that hey man, you take some of this

82
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:15,916
and you'll feel up and
good, you'll feel good.

83
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,046
And you go for it and then you're stuck.

84
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,636
- Hard drugs is an addiction.

85
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:31,858
Charlie Parker, the great
prophet before Coltrane,

86
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,857
Charlie Parker, he was on drugs.

87
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,529
He wanted to get off,
he didn't quite make it.

88
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,865
- There was the misguided notion

89
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:46,866
that artistic ability was
enhanced with hard drugs.

90
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,910
Charlie Parker is the example.

91
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,166
- You're gonna turn from
somebody that can't play

92
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,961
to a Charlie Parker by doing this?

93
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,259
It doesn't happen, it's a myth.

94
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,884
Geez, and some of my friends, I mean,

95
00:07:01,885 --> 00:07:04,429
they died following that trail.

96
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,893
- Before Coltrane was really aware of it,

97
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:13,893
he was using the needle and he
was really heavily addicted.

98
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:15,563
He had become a heroin addict,

99
00:07:15,564 --> 00:07:17,311
and it's not generally known that he

100
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,735
was also drinking to excess.

101
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,150
The funny thing about him though

102
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:22,900
is that everybody loved him.

103
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,903
I'd spoke to over 250
people when I did my book

104
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:27,201
and I couldn't find anybody that said

105
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,993
oh, when he was drunk, he was a terror.

106
00:07:28,994 --> 00:07:31,492
They all said oh, I didn't
even know when he was drunk

107
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:33,661
because he was always so sweet.

108
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:37,883
He was that kind of a person,
but he was unreliable.

109
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,130
Miles Davis famously wrote
in his autobiography,

110
00:07:42,131 --> 00:07:43,924
he would come to the gig in clothes

111
00:07:43,925 --> 00:07:45,845
that looked like he'd slept in them.

112
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:49,936
So this was not making a great
impression on Miles Davis.

113
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,471
- John Coltrane's fired.

114
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,691
He's never been higher in his career,

115
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:57,903
and so the drop down is long and hard,

116
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,565
and he realizes that he can
go the way of Charlie Parker,

117
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:05,159
and just continue on a
self-destructive path

118
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:08,952
or really, is he gonna find
a way of dedicating himself

119
00:08:08,953 --> 00:08:11,325
to a clean spiritual existence

120
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,996
that brings together everything
that has inspired him

121
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,456
from the time he was a child.

122
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,417
And so here's John Coltrane

123
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,967
at a pivotal point of his life.

124
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,427
He's gotta make a decision.

125
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,579
- I was born in a small town called Hamlet

126
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,790
in North Carolina in 1926.

127
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,875
My family moved from there

128
00:08:53,876 --> 00:08:56,910
when I was a few months old to High Point.

129
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,504
I was an only child.

130
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:00,247
I was brought up Methodist.

131
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,208
It wasn't too strict, but it was there.

132
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,006
In my early years when I was
going to church every Sunday,

133
00:09:06,007 --> 00:09:08,928
I was under the influence
of my grandfather.

134
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:12,097
He was the dominating cat in the family.

135
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:15,142
Both of my grandfathers were ministers.

136
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:19,234
I grew up in that and I
guess I just accepted it.

137
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,608
- To understand John Coltrane's beginnings

138
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:26,027
is to understand that he
comes from the American south

139
00:09:26,028 --> 00:09:28,447
and the racial realities
that he grew up with,

140
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:31,037
the idea that the black church

141
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:35,333
was the primary force that
held his family together

142
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,701
and also it was the source point

143
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,501
for his first musical experiences,

144
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,959
and the fact that music and
the spirituality were there

145
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,043
as one at the very beginning

146
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,342
is to really get at the DNA

147
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:52,305
of what John Coltrane's all about.

148
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:21,250
- The Jim Crow South was
basically a reference

149
00:10:21,251 --> 00:10:22,668
to what the south was like

150
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,874
after the Civil War, after reconstruction,

151
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,970
where segregation had been reimposed.

152
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,716
It was a place ready-made for the blues,

153
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:35,968
ready-made for jazz, ready-made for people

154
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,098
using their pain to catapult their art.

155
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,521
- The Jim Crow South
where Coltrane grew up

156
00:10:45,522 --> 00:10:48,945
proceeded from slavery, and under slavery

157
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,610
it was against the law
for us to read or write.

158
00:10:51,611 --> 00:10:54,533
How will our humanity be expressed?

159
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,780
Creatively, courageously.

160
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,078
It was against the law for black people

161
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,701
to worship God without white supervision.

162
00:11:00,702 --> 00:11:01,498
So what do you do?

163
00:11:01,499 --> 00:11:03,496
You steal away at night.

164
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,673
Near the creek.

165
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,419
Hold hands in the rain
shower and lift your voice.

166
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,795
Lift your voice.

167
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:16,017
Vocals create community,
camaraderie and so forth.

168
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:24,141
Black music was the black response

169
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:27,144
to being terrorized and traumatized.

170
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:31,148
We gonna <i>share</i> and spread
<i>some</i> soothing sweetness

171
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:34,151
against the backdrop
of a dark catastrophe.

172
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,699
That's black music.

173
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,803
- John grew up in an extended family.

174
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,804
He was living in the same house
with his mother and father,

175
00:11:56,805 --> 00:11:58,767
his grandfather and grandmother,

176
00:11:58,768 --> 00:12:01,183
and aunt and uncle and cousin.

177
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,890
And then, within a period of two years

178
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:07,485
his father died, his uncle died,

179
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:11,190
his grandfather died, and eventually

180
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,821
so did his grandmother.

181
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,825
It was a devastating few
years for the family.

182
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:21,325
- He's only 12 years old.

183
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,964
Can you imagine what that
does for any human being?

184
00:12:28,206 --> 00:12:30,004
How you gonna respond?

185
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,211
- And the one thing that happens

186
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:37,011
just at that point in
John Coltrane's life is

187
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:39,216
that he started to take up music.

188
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:41,218
He's gone from playing clarinet

189
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,812
to alto saxophone.

190
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,228
And it's almost like he
hangs on to the music

191
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:47,601
like a life preserver.

192
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:50,604
He finds, in music, a way of dealing

193
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,447
with these harsh, harsh realities

194
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:57,785
that are suddenly thrust
upon the Coltrane family.

195
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,866
- Their standard of living

196
00:12:59,867 --> 00:13:02,489
was all of a sudden totally changed.

197
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,241
All the men are gone,

198
00:13:04,242 --> 00:13:06,910
and Coltrane's mother just had to leave

199
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:09,130
and go north to find work.

200
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,309
- When I finished high school

201
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,851
I moved to be with my
mother in Philadelphia.

202
00:13:24,852 --> 00:13:26,063
This was 1943.

203
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,267
I worked for a year in a signal depot.

204
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,191
We had a war, you know.

205
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,272
Then I decided to study music again.

206
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,946
My mother made many sacrifices

207
00:13:36,947 --> 00:13:38,942
to enable me to study music.

208
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,195
And I was able to take <i>lessons</i>

209
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:43,164
from a private saxophone instructor.

210
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,287
- I was 16.

211
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,294
I'd been playing saxophone for two years.

212
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:55,042
When one of the kids
came home from school,

213
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:58,297
he said, "There's a new guy
that moved into the projects,

214
00:13:58,298 --> 00:14:02,301
"and he plays alto, and he
sounds just like Johnny Hodges."

215
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:04,598
I said, "Really?

216
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,639
"Do you think you can bring
him by the house tomorrow?"

217
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,436
He said, "I think so."

218
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,400
About four o'clock the doorbell rang

219
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:15,145
and there was this country
bumpkin' looking' guy

220
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,023
standing on the street.

221
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,363
And he stood in the
doorway with this horn,

222
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:20,906
just stood there.

223
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:22,908
I didn't know what to say.

224
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,326
The only thing I could think to say

225
00:14:24,327 --> 00:14:27,324
was, "Play something."

226
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:30,329
And that's what he was waiting for.

227
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,044
Now, John and I became very close

228
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:37,209
and he joined our little coterie there.

229
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,336
He was quiet.

230
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,504
I had to talk all the time.

231
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:44,726
He never talked until he put
that saxophone is his mouth.

232
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:47,469
Ya.

233
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:09,459
- June 5, 1945, first time
Coltrane sees Charlie Parker.

234
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,419
Blows his mind.

235
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,174
What kind of person is he?

236
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,918
This brother got so
much creativity in him.

237
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,387
Willing to cut against the grain,

238
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:23,046
courageous to the core.

239
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,048
You can just see Coltrane,

240
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,967
just, his mind was blown.

241
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:30,188
- John and I was screaming, screaming.

242
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,523
It's no wonder we didn't
fall over the balcony.

243
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:36,643
We had never heard anything
like that in our life.

244
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:38,362
We'd never heard double-time.

245
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:41,741
It's impossible.

246
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,085
- The first time I heard Charlie Parker,

247
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:55,620
I knew that was the thing for me.

248
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,415
Charlie Parker did all the
things I would like to do

249
00:15:58,416 --> 00:15:59,416
and more.

250
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,885
He really had a genius.

251
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,076
- Coltrane was in the Navy in 1945 to '46

252
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,455
and stationed at Pearl Harbor.

253
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,172
- The very first John Coltrane recordings

254
00:16:42,173 --> 00:16:44,044
quote, unquote come from 1946

255
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,465
when he's a part of a Navy band

256
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,591
and they do this recording in Hawaii

257
00:16:47,592 --> 00:16:49,513
and they're playing big Bird tunes.

258
00:16:49,514 --> 00:16:53,480
And you can hear this
very young John Coltrane

259
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,900
playing and imitating the style
of Charlie Parker, his hero.

260
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,785
- When you hear that recording
from when he's in the Navy,

261
00:17:14,786 --> 00:17:16,498
he doesn't play that well.

262
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:19,623
It's not possible to even
believe it's Coltrane.

263
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:22,501
- Some people blossom very early.

264
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,502
For Coltrane, that was not the case.

265
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,505
I don't think you could listen to that

266
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,929
and say, "Great things ahead."

267
00:17:31,342 --> 00:17:34,094
- And just that he could
go from that way of playing

268
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,597
to what he became, man,

269
00:17:35,598 --> 00:17:39,226
that's all you need to know about him.

270
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:57,786
- After a year in the Navy,

271
00:17:57,787 --> 00:18:01,164
I came back to Philadelphia
and then went on the road.

272
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:03,334
I accepted work with all kinds of groups,

273
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:05,881
even if I didn't agree
with their musical tenets

274
00:18:05,882 --> 00:18:09,963
because I could learn something
while I was making a living.

275
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,549
They were, in comparison to baseball,

276
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,552
like the minor leagues.

277
00:18:18,973 --> 00:18:23,194
I then went with Dizzy
Gillespie from 1949 to 1951.

278
00:18:23,978 --> 00:18:27,564
I wanted to find my own
way but I wasn't ready.

279
00:18:27,565 --> 00:18:30,284
There was so much to learn yet.

280
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,324
- For John Coltrane to be playing

281
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,789
with someone of Dizzy's stature had to be

282
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:39,001
like waking up to all of
your Christmases at one time.

283
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,578
- Dizzy was wonderful.

284
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,872
In every way you can imagine.

285
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:46,583
His sense of humor was incredible.

286
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:48,507
That's how he got the name Dizzy.

287
00:18:48,508 --> 00:18:50,095
But he was a genius.

288
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:52,674
- So Dizz was hearing something

289
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:55,634
in Coltrane's playing as being promising,

290
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:58,605
as being filled with possibilities,

291
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,937
and that this guy needed nurturing.

292
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,604
- When we finally got with Dizzy's band,

293
00:19:05,605 --> 00:19:08,772
John would be practicing in the hotels.

294
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,608
And invariably, somebody would holler,

295
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,361
"Hey, tell that guy to stop all that noise

296
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:16,581
"up there with that horn!"

297
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,288
And Trane would stop practicing

298
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,629
and just finger the horn for an hour;

299
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:26,791
just practice fingering'.

300
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,459
I never seen anybody do that.

301
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,129
- He was such a, just
like compulsive practicer.

302
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,595
He just wanted to practice all the time.

303
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:36,805
I looked up to him so much,

304
00:19:36,806 --> 00:19:38,635
I was like okay, that's what I have to do.

305
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,476
When you start doing' that

306
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,313
you kinda get a connection
with the instrument.

307
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:42,764
I understand why he did that

308
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:44,516
because there's a deeper
connection you get

309
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,188
when you spend that much time with it.

310
00:19:46,189 --> 00:19:49,155
It starts to kinda feel like
an extension of yourself.

311
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,361
- He always had that horn
and he played all day long.

312
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,660
And when he went to work,
during the intermission

313
00:19:58,661 --> 00:20:01,658
he was in the men's room playing his horn.

314
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:04,503
I mean, this is spartan practice.

315
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:06,585
You know, not everybody was into that.

316
00:20:06,586 --> 00:20:08,082
I wasn't into that.

317
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,671
But it was like he was
trying to best himself.

318
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,731
- Dizzy had a very strict
rule about drug use

319
00:20:24,732 --> 00:20:26,943
and that December of 1950,

320
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,694
he caught Coltrane and
Jimmy Heath shooting up.

321
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,860
- We were getting high
down in the basement.

322
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,697
And Dizzy came down at
intermission and he caught us,

323
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,075
and he fired us.

324
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,994
But Trane begged his way back in

325
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,417
and I, I didn't.

326
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:49,914
- Coltrane begged.

327
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,332
"No, please, I won't do it again.

328
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,127
"Let me stay.

329
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,218
"I really love playing with you,"

330
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,586
so forth and so on.

331
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,759
And it worked, Dizzy let him stay.

332
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,723
But it only lasted a few more months.

333
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:01,015
By April of '51, Coltrane was out again.

334
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,520
- I stayed in obscurity for a long time

335
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:11,111
because I was happy to play
what was expected of me

336
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,731
without trying to add anything.

337
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,194
All this time musically,

338
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,739
I was progressing very
little in the way I wanted.

339
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,740
I had not reached the point

340
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,826
when I could take active steps by myself.

341
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,751
In fact, I don't think
I reached that point

342
00:21:29,752 --> 00:21:32,125
until after I got with Miles.

343
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,009
It was Miles who made me wanna be

344
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,924
a much better musician.

345
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,762
In 1955 I joined Miles on a regular basis

346
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:43,770
and worked with him
till the middle of 1957.

347
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,429
Why he picked me, I don't know.

348
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,773
Maybe he saw something in my playing

349
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,767
that he hoped would grow.

350
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:52,771
I had this desire, which
I think we all have,

351
00:21:52,772 --> 00:21:54,864
to be as original as I could be,

352
00:21:54,865 --> 00:21:58,024
but there was so many musical conclusions

353
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,700
I hadn't arrived at
that I felt inadequate.

354
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,169
- In the spring of 1957,

355
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,138
Miles Davis hit a breaking point

356
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:22,632
with John Coltrane in his group.

357
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,972
John Coltrane's drug habit

358
00:22:23,973 --> 00:22:25,811
is getting in the way of the music.

359
00:22:25,812 --> 00:22:29,603
For Miles, there's no
way getting past that.

360
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,685
- Getting fired by Miles

361
00:22:30,686 --> 00:22:32,060
was really the shock of his life

362
00:22:32,061 --> 00:22:35,812
and there was no other gig
like a Miles Davis gig.

363
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:39,315
That was the top of the field, number one.

364
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:43,236
And number two is that he was
kinda counting on this gig

365
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,080
for his security and stability,

366
00:22:45,081 --> 00:22:48,997
and building a home, and
having a married life.

367
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:53,377
- John Coltrane was by no
means the only great musician

368
00:22:53,378 --> 00:22:55,170
who had drug problems.

369
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,510
Killed Charlie Parker at an early age

370
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:59,845
and many other were afflicted.

371
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,008
When he looked into the abyss,

372
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,350
he decided that he
couldn't stay where he was.

373
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:11,975
He was either gonna go down and die

374
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,901
or go up and become even greater.

375
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,864
- He quit what they call cold-turkey,

376
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:29,866
which means he didn't go to an institution

377
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,332
and he didn't have any
kind of medical support.

378
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,046
During the days he would just stay home

379
00:23:34,047 --> 00:23:35,881
and keep the doors closed.

380
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,895
- Only one time did it ever
become difficult for me

381
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:51,429
and that was when he was withdrawing.

382
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,103
And I could hear him.

383
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,185
I could see mommy taking'
him to the bathroom

384
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:00,156
because he was always regurgitating.

385
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,942
He was doing the cold-turkey.

386
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,193
One night it was really, really bad

387
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,538
and I became really afraid.

388
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:10,531
And I remember praying, saying to myself,

389
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:12,000
"Please, God, don't

390
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,710
"don't take my father."

391
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,940
And each night he seemed to

392
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,569
not be as sick.

393
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,042
- And we thank God, you know, that He

394
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:57,922
allowed John Coltrane to get past,

395
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,883
you know, the gates of hell.

396
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,962
- He just decided to do it.

397
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:07,965
And by strength of will

398
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,434
and faith, he did.

399
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,277
- So he cleaned up.

400
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:22,317
And when he cleaned up,

401
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,608
things began to unfold.

402
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:47,008
- During the year 1957

403
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:49,922
I experienced, by the grace of God,

404
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,842
a spiritual awakening which was to lead me

405
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:56,222
to a richer, fuller, more productive life.

406
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,140
At that time, in gratitude,

407
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:02,977
I humbly asked to be given
the means and privilege

408
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,652
to make others happy through music.

409
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,168
- John Coltrane returns to New York

410
00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:20,203
after he gets himself clean,

411
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:23,414
and he's very much like
a man on a mission.

412
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:27,215
- After going cold-turkey
and not using drugs,

413
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,754
his energy level went up a notch.

414
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:31,052
He smiled more.

415
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,050
You know, that gorilla off your back.

416
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:36,850
Ya, I think he was really happy.

417
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:41,316
- When I stopped drinking
and all that other stuff,

418
00:26:41,317 --> 00:26:44,060
it helped me in all kinds of ways.

419
00:26:44,061 --> 00:26:47,605
I was able to play better
right then, you know?

420
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,701
I could play better and think better.

421
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:51,734
Everything.

422
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,822
- Very significantly,
that's also the time period

423
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,118
that he started playing

424
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,289
with Thelonious Monk on an informal basis,

425
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,629
and then joined his band in July of '57.

426
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,665
- If you say Thelonious
Monk's name to any musician,

427
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,505
I'd say to Miles, "Thelonious Monk,"

428
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:08,844
he'd say, "Oh, Monk Monk Monk."

429
00:27:08,845 --> 00:27:12,088
Dizzy, "Oh, whoa, whoa,
whoa, Monk Monk Monk."

430
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:14,260
First, his musicianship was supreme;

431
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:16,598
just his knowledge, his ability to play,

432
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,344
his harmonic sophistication,

433
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,471
the structures of his songs,

434
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:23,141
and it's Coltrane learning from Monk.

435
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:24,644
Trane would come in the morning

436
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:26,737
and they would just practice all day.

437
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:29,607
- You spending' time in Monk's house

438
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,858
and he's going through,

439
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:34,453
that level of genius taking time

440
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,119
to help nurture your genius.

441
00:27:41,118 --> 00:27:43,291
- After working with Thelonious Monk,

442
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:45,915
Coltrane is fully on his feet.

443
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,633
- He's got the confidence now.

444
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,127
And it is in 1957

445
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,140
that he records his
first album as a leader.

446
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,382
- The cover says Coltrane.

447
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,555
You know, it's like once you're known

448
00:27:57,556 --> 00:28:00,136
just by your last name, you
know you're already getting big.

449
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:01,309
And then it said up in the corner,

450
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,683
it said the NEW, in capital letters,

451
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,355
tenor saxophone star.

452
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,149
And the other thing is
that he had an opportunity

453
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:10,819
to do some of his own original music.

454
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,746
- His music just sounded different.

455
00:28:23,747 --> 00:28:25,917
It was like there was new blood in it;

456
00:28:25,918 --> 00:28:29,918
his playing, there was
new blood in his playing.

457
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,175
There was a certain kind
of almost recklessness.

458
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:47,105
He's pushing forward,

459
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,521
such that he may not even know

460
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,190
what he's pushing forward to.

461
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,552
- After my late teens,

462
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:21,217
I questioned a lot of what
I had found in religion,

463
00:29:21,218 --> 00:29:23,219
but I never did anything about it.

464
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,019
I was too busy doing other things.

465
00:29:26,223 --> 00:29:27,812
Recently I started looking into

466
00:29:27,813 --> 00:29:29,185
what people were thinking

467
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:31,482
when I saw there were so many religions

468
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:35,233
and kind of opposed somewhat
to the next and so forth.

469
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,614
It screwed up my head.

470
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,321
I just couldn't believe
that one guy could be right,

471
00:29:40,322 --> 00:29:44,541
because if he's right, somebody
else has gotta be wrong.

472
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:48,420
- The three of us, we didn't
go to church every Sunday.

473
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:52,167
But I knew that my
parents believed in God.

474
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,344
They had a strong belief in God.

475
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,255
We had bibles.

476
00:29:58,547 --> 00:29:59,839
We had the Koran.

477
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,061
My father was looking at
different eastern religion;

478
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,474
Buddhism, Shinto.

479
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,389
- He never set out specifically to say

480
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,516
I'm a Christian or I'm a Muslim

481
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:12,893
or I'm a Hindu or a Buddhist.

482
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,271
I think he studied all of these religions

483
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:18,276
and understood that there is
something higher than that.

484
00:30:18,277 --> 00:30:20,276
There's something that all these religions

485
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,279
are basically saying that's universal.

486
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,624
- I like to describe
it as a little picture,

487
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:29,040
which is our world, and the big picture.

488
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,255
John was about the big picture.

489
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,167
John was very celestial.

490
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,803
Celestial meant spiritual.

491
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,296
He had a deep understanding,

492
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,719
a deep feeling for

493
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,053
higher worlds than this world.

494
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,684
- Coltrane was definitely someone

495
00:30:48,685 --> 00:30:52,308
who was inspired by the
concept of the infinite,

496
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:55,904
and imagining how science
and music and math

497
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:59,108
all worked together, and
that there was some kind

498
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,484
of universal truth.

499
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,324
And so for Coltrane to be inspired

500
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:06,950
by Albert Einstein, who is a deep thinker,

501
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:11,162
not just about space
travel and time and energy,

502
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,413
but the biggest of the big questions.

503
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,414
Why are we here?

504
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,380
What are we supposed to be doing?

505
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,970
And where are we supposed
to take ourselves?

506
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:23,340
Coltrane was absolutely on that same road.

507
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:48,749
- At the end of 1957, Coltrane
came back into Miles' band.

508
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,370
The difference though, the
second stint with Miles,

509
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:56,340
is that now Coltrane kinda
had a sense of who he was.

510
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,883
One of the reasons that being with Miles

511
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,136
was so productive for Coltrane

512
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:12,390
is that Miles gave him tons of space.

513
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:14,390
Miles let him solo at length

514
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:17,861
and he really didn't try to edit Coltrane.

515
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,405
He didn't say, you know,
when you're playing with me

516
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:23,571
you gotta play shorter solos than I do.

517
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,530
Almost invariably, Coltrane
played longer solos.

518
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:27,992
There is a famous story

519
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:30,457
about Miles making a joke to Coltrane

520
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:33,159
in saying why do you play so long

521
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,039
and Coltrane saying well, I
can't find a good place to stop.

522
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,164
And Miles saying well,

523
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,463
you could just take the
horn out of your mouth.

524
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:48,340
- Miles is a strange guy.

525
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,594
He doesn't talk a lot and
he rarely discusses music.

526
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,267
You always have the impression
that he's in a bad mood

527
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:55,561
and that he's not interested in

528
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:58,517
or affected by what
other people are doing.

529
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,441
It's very hard in a situation like that

530
00:33:00,442 --> 00:33:03,189
to know exactly what you should do.

531
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,111
And maybe it's because of that

532
00:33:05,112 --> 00:33:07,611
that I just started to do what I wanted.

533
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,548
- Here we go.

534
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:53,182
- Wait.
- Okay.

535
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:56,766
- Trane and I'll play one,

536
00:34:57,262 --> 00:34:59,264
you know, together, out.

537
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:00,556
You know what I mean?

538
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,397
Can you hear me?

539
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:02,398
- Ya.

540
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,277
- Let's go.

541
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:12,901
- Oh, Kind of Blue was one

542
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,279
of the greatest records ever made.

543
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,573
It's just got a great feel.

544
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:20,623
You can never grow tired of that album.

545
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,205
And it crosses all boundaries.

546
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:26,040
People who don't understand jazz get it.

547
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,084
- Kind of Blue is so key to understanding

548
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:32,589
where John Coltrane would go in the 1960s.

549
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,591
That really is sort of the fuse

550
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:38,391
to the Coltrane explosion later.

551
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,596
It's very interesting.

552
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,722
You've got the first session

553
00:35:41,723 --> 00:35:44,308
from Kind of Blue in early '59.

554
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,310
A little while later,
about a month and a half,

555
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,395
you've got the second session.

556
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:51,616
In between, John Coltrane's
doing Giant Steps.

557
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,627
- It was unprecedented.

558
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,423
It was something that forced all of us

559
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:10,673
to call into question
what we had been hearing

560
00:36:11,211 --> 00:36:13,634
as that which was innovative.

561
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,638
- Every tune on Giant Steps
was composed by Coltrane.

562
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:23,265
So, that album was huge for him

563
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,641
because it showed something

564
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,643
that I don't think people yet knew,

565
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,771
which is that he was
as brilliant a composer

566
00:36:30,772 --> 00:36:32,774
as we was a saxophonist.

567
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,668
- Writing has always been
a secondary thing for me,

568
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,503
but I find that lately

569
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,580
I'm spending more and more time at it.

570
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,675
I'm trying to tune myself,

571
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,168
to look to myself and to nature

572
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,254
and to other sounds in music,

573
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,678
and interpret things I feel there.

574
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:03,100
- So Miles' band was a great environment

575
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:06,646
for Coltrane to grow, and he grew so much

576
00:37:07,434 --> 00:37:09,687
that he grew too big for the band.

577
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,029
I mean, he grew out of it.

578
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,647
He couldn't exist in it anymore.

579
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,026
- He was actually saying to me

580
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,488
he was going to leave Miles Davis,

581
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:19,703
"I'm gonna leave Miles

582
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:22,996
"because what I'm playing with that group

583
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:26,002
"sounds incorrect, sounds wrong."

584
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:28,922
It's like he took off a suit of clothes

585
00:37:28,923 --> 00:37:31,837
that he doesn't wanna wear anymore.

586
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:34,460
- And from the time we
started out in my living room,

587
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,054
we knew nothing that was going to happen.

588
00:37:36,055 --> 00:37:38,013
It just happened when it happened.

589
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:42,134
But when it did happen, I
said it should've happened

590
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,052
because he was really ready.

591
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,929
He had his stuff together there.

592
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,728
Yes, this should be.

593
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:56,732
- John Coltrane is one
of my favorite creators

594
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,906
because he was very soulful,

595
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,448
and stories being told through his music

596
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,711
without even words;
stories through experience.

597
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:10,370
We know somebody went up and down

598
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,664
and then came back up again.

599
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,759
We celebrate them and we relate to them

600
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,753
because we all have our ups and downs.

601
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,051
- You know, some people play jazz,

602
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:21,095
some people play reggae,
some people play blues.

603
00:38:21,096 --> 00:38:22,387
He played life.

604
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,822
- You can't describe music with words.

605
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,524
We can say oh, ya, this guy was doing

606
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,868
a lot of technical stuff.

607
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:25,831
Wow, when we analyze it,
and wow, look at this.

608
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,825
Look at these changes and these harmonics.

609
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:33,831
But it's not about that,
it's about hearing it.

610
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:48,061
- His sound, you know,
it makes people cry.

611
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:50,387
Like oh, damn, what is this tears?

612
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,184
Why am I crying?

613
00:39:51,185 --> 00:39:52,602
What's going on?

614
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:56,858
Your body's doing something
that your mind don't want to do.

615
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,788
- His sound is stunning.

616
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:20,878
It ranges through the
different emotions people have

617
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,339
in a way that very few people can do.

618
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,342
And as I said, he did it

619
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,604
partly from his own inner spirit,

620
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:34,848
but he also was intellectually brilliant,

621
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,443
that is he wrote brilliant music

622
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,365
and he could take a standard
and play it in a way

623
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,496
that made you think you were
hearing it for the first time.

624
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,337
- Within a year of leaving
Miles Davis for good,

625
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,842
John Coltrane has an incredible radio hit

626
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:12,805
with his tune that is
from The Sound of Music.

627
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,414
- So here's this Broadway melody,

628
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:41,003
oh, and he just transforms
it into this gorgeous thing.

629
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,729
- My Favorite Things was a record

630
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,982
that I actually played for my friends

631
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:07,109
because I felt like they would like it.

632
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,822
The reason that music touches everybody

633
00:42:08,823 --> 00:42:10,989
is that was Coltrane's intention.

634
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:13,947
And he put a lot of everybody's
music in that music.

635
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,291
You know, in that soprano saxophone,

636
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,001
that kind of nasal sound is really popular

637
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,410
all over the world.

638
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:20,250
Coltrane had worked on
that his entire life.

639
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:21,997
How can I bring people together

640
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,418
and how can I bring these cultures

641
00:42:23,419 --> 00:42:26,043
and how can I bring this music together.

642
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:27,887
And what allowed him to bring it together

643
00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:29,973
was a spiritual consciousness.

644
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,334
- He is creating this new approach,

645
00:43:07,335 --> 00:43:09,836
this new sound that many people

646
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,214
would not even expect to hear from jazz,

647
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,674
an Eastern sound if you will,

648
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,885
a much more spiritual sound.

649
00:43:16,886 --> 00:43:21,062
It is so fresh and yet wonderfully
popular at the same time.

650
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,066
- I've got to keep experimenting.

651
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:28,438
I feel that I'm just beginning.

652
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,775
I have a part of what I'm
looking for in my grasp,

653
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,777
but not all.

654
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,117
I like Eastern music.

655
00:43:35,118 --> 00:43:38,743
Africa, Spain or Scotland, India or China.

656
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,081
It's that universal side of music

657
00:43:41,082 --> 00:43:43,500
which interests and draws me.

658
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:46,086
And that's where I wanna go.

659
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,298
- For Coltrane, I think
there was a pattern

660
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:51,508
of doing something that is unexpected

661
00:43:51,509 --> 00:43:53,093
when you look at what came before it.

662
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:56,718
So he would do something that
would sort of trip himself up

663
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,094
so he could figure out what to do next.

664
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,096
And that sense of struggle

665
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:05,273
and thinking through the
next problem propelled him

666
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,103
and made him keep getting better

667
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:12,107
and stronger and more
interesting and challenging.

668
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:14,202
- He was never satisfied.

669
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:15,986
Insatiable.

670
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:18,827
If he got from here to there,

671
00:44:18,828 --> 00:44:20,118
he wanted to go there.

672
00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:22,537
And if he got there, he
wanted to go over there.

673
00:44:22,538 --> 00:44:24,119
- There's an intensity that

674
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,463
I've never heard anything like it,

675
00:44:25,464 --> 00:44:27,080
before him or after him.

676
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,255
I always liken it to looking at the sun.

677
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,386
Hearing John Coltrane, it's like

678
00:44:32,387 --> 00:44:35,131
the brightest light you can hear.

679
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,133
- I mean, his tone is so unique.

680
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:39,477
I mean, it's so striking.

681
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:43,018
I mean, no one had that tone on the horn.

682
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:47,064
During that time it became the standard.

683
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:59,654
- It's not the car, it's the driver.

684
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,874
So his sound, it sounds like it's coming

685
00:45:01,875 --> 00:45:04,075
from some deep part of himself.

686
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,621
Even though you hear
him on different horns,

687
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,712
you hear him on different mouth pieces,

688
00:45:06,713 --> 00:45:08,625
you can see him playing different setups.

689
00:45:08,626 --> 00:45:10,000
Still, it doesn't matter.

690
00:45:10,001 --> 00:45:11,958
It's coming from that soul.

691
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,633
- His grandfather was a preacher.

692
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:16,347
And I can hear that,

693
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:21,343
they said there's a
wailing, sometimes wailing.

694
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:24,063
I can hear Trane's appreciation

695
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,184
for what his grandfather's mission was.

696
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:57,087
- The evolution of John Coltrane's bands,

697
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,217
till he develops what we now
call the classic quartet,

698
00:46:00,218 --> 00:46:03,186
is typical Coltrane experimentation.

699
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,887
It's him trying out new ideas,

700
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,890
new players, new things.

701
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,945
- He went through a lot of
tryouts with different people,

702
00:46:13,396 --> 00:46:17,242
and finally he got the
group that he wanted.

703
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:21,238
And he was able to fly
like he wanted to do.

704
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,273
- I'm very lucky.

705
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:00,567
I work with very fine musicians.

706
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,113
They are very inventive.

707
00:47:02,114 --> 00:47:04,580
I don't have to tell anybody what to do.

708
00:47:04,581 --> 00:47:07,699
We have a great confidence in one another,

709
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,247
that's essential.

710
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:11,003
They're with me in always wanting

711
00:47:11,004 --> 00:47:13,288
the band to move into new areas.

712
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:16,293
We don't believe in standing still.

713
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,222
- And just to have Elvin,
the level of intelligence,

714
00:47:23,223 --> 00:47:24,305
<i>the seriousness that he was on,</i>

715
00:47:24,306 --> 00:47:25,425
and Jimmy the type of heart he had,

716
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,305
and McCoy who was young, was a kid.

717
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,013
They are originals.

718
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,311
They sent music in another direction,

719
00:47:31,312 --> 00:47:34,686
gave us another way to perceive
the universe through music.

720
00:47:34,687 --> 00:47:38,315
People who heard them, their
lives were transformed.

721
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:49,705
- When I was 17 I was a jazz buff.

722
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,162
I was well aware of rock 'n roll,

723
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:57,542
but I considered jazz the higher art form.

724
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,341
I had heard that Coltrane was coming

725
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,424
to Shelly's Manne-Hole in Hollywood.

726
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:08,891
Saw them, oh, I don't
know, five or six times.

727
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,054
Unbelievable.

728
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,651
I didn't know that Coltrane
would be such an icon,

729
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:19,230
but I sensed that I was witnessing magic.

730
00:48:20,356 --> 00:48:23,280
It would be just like Coltrane
would be saying something

731
00:48:23,281 --> 00:48:24,993
on his tenor or soprano,

732
00:48:26,362 --> 00:48:29,656
Elvin would answer

733
00:48:29,657 --> 00:48:32,456
and then it would get all intertwined.

734
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,329
It was free, ooh.

735
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,208
I mean, they still would come back

736
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:38,670
to the tune and the chord changes,

737
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:41,385
but they'd go out on the
edge as far as they could.

738
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:42,879
They were inspiring.

739
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,221
The bathroom at Shelly's Manne-Hole

740
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:57,058
was behind the stage,
next to the dressing room.

741
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,394
I went to the bathroom a lot.

742
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,647
And I didn't really have to go,

743
00:49:00,648 --> 00:49:02,774
but I was near my heroes.

744
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:06,651
One time I came out of the bathroom door

745
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:10,373
and Coltrane was just
standing there looking at me.

746
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:16,128
And I shunned eye contact and
then he went to the stage.

747
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,676
He had this quiet
spirituality about himself.

748
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,795
Everybody kinda parted like the Red Sea.

749
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,016
And then right behind him was Elvin Jones.

750
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:38,567
Elvin Jones gave me my
hands, which he did.

751
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:42,109
I copied all his style.

752
00:49:43,606 --> 00:49:45,565
And then I found my own.

753
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:49,196
I think it gave me the courage to maybe...

754
00:49:49,445 --> 00:49:50,947
A drummer's job is to keep the beat,

755
00:49:50,948 --> 00:49:53,448
but then, if you can be expressive,

756
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,747
have a conversation with the singer

757
00:49:55,748 --> 00:49:58,462
or the soloist, you can push 'em.

758
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,583
And I witnessed that
with Elvin and Coltrane,

759
00:50:01,584 --> 00:50:05,587
and I pushed Jim Morrison
because of those guys.

760
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,464
The greatest quartet
in the history of jazz.

761
00:50:09,465 --> 00:50:10,466
Miraculous.

762
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,635
- We were like brothers.

763
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,388
And we were there for a reason,

764
00:50:15,389 --> 00:50:18,391
which was to create beautiful music.

765
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,475
You know, I use the word beautiful

766
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:24,354
because I couldn't think of a better word.

767
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:25,355
But,

768
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,192
we were committed.

769
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,423
We thought that what we were doing,

770
00:50:46,424 --> 00:50:49,003
the gift came from the Almighty.

771
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:50,722
Not that we were walking around,
I'm this, I'm that...

772
00:50:50,723 --> 00:50:53,007
you know, I'm this, I'm that.

773
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,601
It's not ego at all.

774
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:57,345
It's what you were put here for,

775
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,815
what's your reason for being here.

776
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,034
- Birmingham is a symbol

777
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,380
of hard-core resistance to integration.

778
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,755
It is probably the most
thoroughly segregated city

779
00:52:08,756 --> 00:52:11,628
in the United States, and the injustices

780
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:15,850
inflicted upon Negroes are
the notorious realities.

781
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,729
- Growing up in the south, of course,

782
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:30,823
I know he wanted things to be better.

783
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,485
But he didn't talk about it.

784
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,951
I think he put that in his music.

785
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:24,075
- Coltrane did talk politics in his music.

786
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,670
It was only a few months after

787
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,664
that horrible bombing of a church,

788
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:32,669
and he wrote a piece called Alabama.

789
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:37,765
- And it shows the creativity
and depth of Coltrane.

790
00:53:38,424 --> 00:53:41,678
A beautiful elegy screaming with pain,

791
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,679
under-girded by love.

792
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,810
I mean, it was just, it's
a masterful piece really.

793
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,905
- These children,

794
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,987
unoffending innocent and beautiful,

795
00:53:57,276 --> 00:54:00,486
were the victims of
one of the most vicious

796
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:04,708
and tragic crimes ever
perpetrated against humanity.

797
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:14,551
- Coltrane himself told McCoy
Tyner, his piano player,

798
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,922
that he developed the
melody out of the speech

799
00:54:17,923 --> 00:54:20,131
that Martin Luther King gave.

800
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:22,425
- And today, as I stand over

801
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:26,226
the remains of these
beautiful, darling girls,

802
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:29,692
I paraphrase the words of Shakespeare.

803
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,736
Goodnight sweet princesses.

804
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:36,695
Goodnight those who symbolize a new day.

805
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,324
May the flight of angels take thee

806
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,873
to thy eternal rest.

807
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:50,671
- Martin Luther King Jr. John
Coltrane go hand-in-hand.

808
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,255
Hand-in-hand.

809
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,085
Why?

810
00:54:53,086 --> 00:54:54,749
Because they're love warriors.

811
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,546
They represent the best,
not just of black people,

812
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:57,339
not just for America.

813
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,840
They represent the best
of the human spirit.

814
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,179
- That song has a soul

815
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,136
that lets you know that

816
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,974
it was a lot of pain going on there,

817
00:55:10,057 --> 00:55:12,151
but it's something that's

818
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,779
inspirational about that song.

819
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,154
When you hear Alabama, you
feel all that struggle,

820
00:55:19,155 --> 00:55:22,777
from those times, the times
of the civil rights days,

821
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,247
but you all feel the progress.

822
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,250
- John Coltrane was ahead of his time.

823
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:31,786
I don't think that his
music is a thermometer.

824
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,334
It's a thermostat.

825
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,799
See, a thermometer just
reflects the climate.

826
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,544
A thermostat shapes the climate.

827
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:42,799
So when you hear Alabama,
it's not just his deep love

828
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,674
of the precious four girls

829
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,053
who were killed by
cowardly white supremacists

830
00:55:47,054 --> 00:55:49,470
in 16th Street Baptist Church.

831
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,098
It's not just a re-figuration musically

832
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:55,069
of certain speech patterns
of Martin Luther King Jr.

833
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:59,281
He's looking at black people
all the way down the road.

834
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:07,827
He's already telling us
you gonna need courage,

835
00:56:07,828 --> 00:56:10,542
vision, and most importantly love

836
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,578
at the center of it.

837
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:19,676
- As black people, we've been
through a lot in this country,

838
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,303
and we stay hopeful.

839
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,631
And that's what I feel in Alabama,

840
00:56:23,632 --> 00:56:27,851
is the pain we went through
but the hope that we have.

841
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,805
- It was at night when all of the sudden

842
00:57:08,806 --> 00:57:12,680
the voices got louder
and louder and louder and

843
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,641
I'm like, uh oh, oh dear.

844
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,893
What is going on?

845
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,375
- It's hard to know
specifically what was happening

846
00:57:34,376 --> 00:57:38,120
in John Coltrane's personal
life in the early '60s,

847
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,919
but certainly there's indications

848
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,091
that he was not that happy
with his marriage to Naima.

849
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:48,181
- They didn't know I was sitting

850
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:51,101
around the bend of the stairway,

851
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:53,933
but I could hear everything.

852
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:57,399
Neither one of my parents were arguers.

853
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,940
So when that argument erupted,

854
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,689
I knew something was
really, really, really bad.

855
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,690
And

856
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:09,445
that was the day he left.

857
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:14,907
But he came back and he talked to me.

858
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:18,786
He said there were things
going on I can't explain.

859
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,460
I love you very much.

860
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,208
You're my daughter.

861
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,968
I'll always take care of you.

862
00:58:25,961 --> 00:58:27,338
And that was it.

863
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:55,161
- My mother, Alice McLeod at the time,

864
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:58,246
was playing with a
vibraphonist named Terry Gibbs

865
00:58:58,247 --> 00:58:59,994
and they were doing a double bill

866
00:58:59,995 --> 00:59:02,121
with John Coltrane's Quartet

867
00:59:02,122 --> 00:59:06,000
at the original Birdland on
52nd Street in New York City.

868
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:09,420
- They noticed each other
and it was a little bit

869
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:12,095
like, you know, there's a young lady here,

870
00:59:12,096 --> 00:59:14,092
and oh, she's a pianist.

871
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:18,512
John definitely stuck
around to hear a little bit

872
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,107
of her playing and admired that.

873
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:27,447
- Something in the sound of
his tenor caught her ear.

874
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,781
At one point, in between
the breaks of the band,

875
00:59:31,782 --> 00:59:34,445
my father started to follow my mother

876
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,040
around the club with his horn.

877
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:41,035
So he was serenading her through the club,

878
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:42,879
and I guess at that point they began

879
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,249
to sit and have conversations.

880
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,335
- They spoke.

881
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:52,556
They had a lot of things
in common when they spoke.

882
00:59:52,881 --> 00:59:55,633
- I just remember my mother saying

883
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:59,229
that he's just a very
kind, gracious person,

884
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:04,647
very decent man, and they
hit it off very well.

885
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:19,541
- She was interested in the harp

886
01:00:19,542 --> 01:00:22,753
and he bought her a concert size harp.

887
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:24,787
Beautiful.

888
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,248
It's painted in gold, you know,

889
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,798
like an orchestra would have.

890
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,879
I think that's true love

891
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,178
when someone buys you a harp.

892
01:00:42,931 --> 01:00:44,557
They're both gentle people,

893
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,653
I think perfectly paired by the universe.

894
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,869
- John Coltrane used
to leave little notes,

895
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:59,113
little poems, expressing
his love for Alice

896
01:00:59,114 --> 01:01:00,411
around the home.

897
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:02,286
He would leave for the gig.

898
01:01:02,287 --> 01:01:04,285
You know, she would come back to the house

899
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:07,037
and she would find these little messages.

900
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,130
And I don't think the romance

901
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:11,468
ever left John and Alice's relationship.

902
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,138
- He was married before,
and for whatever reasons

903
01:01:22,139 --> 01:01:25,186
did not have any children with Naima.

904
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,145
Clearly, when he met my mom,

905
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:31,900
they didn't waste much time.

906
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:37,152
In a very short span three sons were born.

907
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:42,283
He was an only child and his father

908
01:01:42,284 --> 01:01:44,501
was an only child as well.

909
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,370
So I think maybe it was something

910
01:01:46,371 --> 01:01:50,169
that he wanted to do in his
lifetime, to father children,

911
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,169
and I think it made him extremely happy.

912
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:49,515
- John Coltrane has set aside some time

913
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:53,737
and he secludes himself
above the garage in his house

914
01:02:53,979 --> 01:02:56,107
at Dix Hills, Long Island

915
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:59,823
to put together what he sees as a suite.

916
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,241
He doesn't know how it's gonna go.

917
01:03:02,242 --> 01:03:05,457
He has some loose melodies, some ideas.

918
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,825
Mrs. Coltrane tells the story

919
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,295
about him coming down
and grabbing little bits

920
01:03:10,296 --> 01:03:12,255
of food now and again,

921
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,841
and then disappearing for a whole day.

922
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:17,293
This is just after John Jr. is born.

923
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,254
So she's got her four year old daughter

924
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:23,429
and an infant and a disappeared husband.

925
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,265
- And she said he was upstairs.

926
01:03:26,266 --> 01:03:29,013
This was like two weeks he was up there.

927
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:31,813
And she always related these stories to us

928
01:03:31,814 --> 01:03:35,028
in a happy way, that what he was doing

929
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:39,275
was significant and important
and she understood that;

930
01:03:39,276 --> 01:03:41,608
as if he was on a mission and she

931
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,611
was there to support it.

932
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:48,284
- A few days later he
comes down the stairs,

933
01:03:48,285 --> 01:03:49,956
and as Mrs. Coltrane put it,

934
01:03:49,957 --> 01:03:54,163
"it was like Moses coming
down from the mountain."

935
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:57,338
And for once, the guy who really thought

936
01:03:57,375 --> 01:04:00,466
and rethought about music,
seemed very satisfied

937
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:02,806
with where he was with this project,

938
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:05,299
and his words to Mrs. Coltrane were,

939
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,222
"it's the first time I
have everything ready.

940
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,471
"I've completed the project on paper.

941
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:13,897
"I know exactly what I'm
gonna do in the studio."

942
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,345
- All praise to God.

943
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:45,804
This album is a humble offering to Him,

944
01:04:46,174 --> 01:04:48,768
an attempt to say thank you God,

945
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:53,806
through our work, even as
we do through our hearts,

946
01:04:53,807 --> 01:04:55,480
and with our tongues.

947
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:58,900
May He help and strengthen all men

948
01:04:59,521 --> 01:05:01,364
in every good endeavor.

949
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:06,328
- It's the individual expression of a

950
01:05:08,822 --> 01:05:12,658
musical titan who wants
to give a certain message

951
01:05:12,659 --> 01:05:16,880
to the world, in light of
his own relationship to God.

952
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:41,647
- A Love Supreme is something

953
01:05:41,648 --> 01:05:44,857
I think every great musician aspires to,

954
01:05:44,858 --> 01:05:47,276
which is finding that one moment

955
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,867
or that one song or that one recording,

956
01:05:49,868 --> 01:05:52,491
that one album which
really kind of encapsulates

957
01:05:52,492 --> 01:05:56,040
everything that they are,
what their message is.

958
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:11,434
- The thing about A Love Supreme,

959
01:06:11,435 --> 01:06:13,969
all of Trane's mysticism is in it.

960
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,438
The totality of his consciousness

961
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:18,932
expresses itself most
fully on that record.

962
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,854
I don't even think he knew why.

963
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:22,523
Sometimes in the life of artists

964
01:06:22,524 --> 01:06:24,568
or people who search
and practice and study

965
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:26,904
and work on stuff, they find things

966
01:06:26,905 --> 01:06:28,447
and it's in there.

967
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:30,453
And it was in there.

968
01:06:41,664 --> 01:06:45,794
- The second piece on there
is the one that touches me.

969
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:05,364
That's the one that
touches me, that melody.

970
01:07:06,314 --> 01:07:07,816
- Where does it take you?

971
01:07:07,817 --> 01:07:09,650
- It takes me to heaven,

972
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:12,530
where I wanna be when I leave here.

973
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:17,667
That's it, isn't it?

974
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,225
- And the audacity that someone

975
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:47,447
would absolutely speak to the
heavens using a jazz group,

976
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:53,286
it speaks to the singularity
of John Coltrane's vision.

977
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:54,620
- I think I played that album

978
01:07:54,621 --> 01:07:58,156
more than I play any
other album in my life.

979
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,118
When somebody's music is that uplifting,

980
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,712
there's something angelic about it,

981
01:08:02,713 --> 01:08:06,331
just something that just
touches you in your spirit

982
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,005
where you're like I know this

983
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:10,504
is coming from another place.

984
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,552
- I just thought oh my god,

985
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,850
you know, this guy,

986
01:08:16,968 --> 01:08:17,968
his mind,

987
01:08:19,387 --> 01:08:20,980
and his heart is so,

988
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:27,566
they're in a place that
everybody ought to reach for.

989
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,747
- May we never forget

990
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:44,536
that in the sunshine of our lives,

991
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,586
through the storm and after the rain,

992
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,584
it is all with God.

993
01:08:50,585 --> 01:08:52,587
In all ways and forever.

994
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:55,882
All praise to God.

995
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:18,278
- It was '67 and I was
with a friend of mine

996
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,075
who was a conga player.

997
01:09:19,076 --> 01:09:20,242
He'd just came into the band.

998
01:09:20,243 --> 01:09:22,866
His name was Marcus
The Magnificent Malone.

999
01:09:22,867 --> 01:09:24,287
He took me to his house,

1000
01:09:24,288 --> 01:09:26,834
he says here man, and
he put a joint in there,

1001
01:09:26,835 --> 01:09:29,915
and he put John Coltrane,
he put it on, loud.

1002
01:09:29,916 --> 01:09:31,213
A Love Supreme.

1003
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,883
* A love supreme a love supreme

1004
01:09:41,928 --> 01:09:44,647
I remember it, that it was like,

1005
01:09:47,392 --> 01:09:51,613
like a vortex of a whole new
* A love supreme

1006
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:55,649
* A love supreme experience.

1007
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,651
Different than Jimi Hendrix,

1008
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,403
different than Otis Redding,

1009
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:02,453
different than BB King or
Tito Puente or Olatunji.

1010
01:10:02,454 --> 01:10:03,825
It was a vortex of

1011
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,663
possibilities.

1012
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,812
I play A Love Supreme a lot.

1013
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:31,271
And I play it in every hotel that I go to.

1014
01:10:31,272 --> 01:10:33,692
As soon as I walk in, I
put on a little sound,

1015
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:35,406
put out some incense,

1016
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:39,365
and I have no doubt
that that room is clean

1017
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:43,073
from negative, harmful spirits.

1018
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,959
That's why he is so important

1019
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,703
because it doesn't matter what religion

1020
01:10:49,704 --> 01:10:52,082
or what ideology you believe,

1021
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,542
his sound is the sound of light

1022
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,341
and the sound of love.

1023
01:10:57,712 --> 01:11:00,886
And I'm happy to tell you
that I'm very grateful

1024
01:11:00,887 --> 01:11:03,761
that my eyes, my heart, and my ears

1025
01:11:04,719 --> 01:11:07,848
will always be open to John Coltrane.

1026
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,482
- John was a genius.

1027
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,450
Beethoven survives.

1028
01:11:19,734 --> 01:11:20,860
Bach survives.

1029
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,195
I don't think we should be afraid

1030
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:26,200
to put John on their level at least.

1031
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:30,166
Anything John plays, anything John writes

1032
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:31,912
is beyond,

1033
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,381
unquestionably beyond.

1034
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:40,426
- Coltrane gave another dimension

1035
01:11:40,427 --> 01:11:43,641
to American music in the 20th century.

1036
01:11:43,758 --> 01:11:45,178
His music was deeply rooted

1037
01:11:45,179 --> 01:11:46,760
in the Afro-American experience

1038
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:47,978
and in the American experience,

1039
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:50,644
and with Coltrane, because of his studies

1040
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:53,767
and his seriousness, the human experience.

1041
01:11:53,768 --> 01:11:57,771
- This music is connected
to an awful lot of stuff,

1042
01:11:57,772 --> 01:11:59,356
and it's connected to the past,

1043
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:00,324
and it's connected to the future,

1044
01:12:00,325 --> 01:12:02,776
and it's connected to you, you know,

1045
01:12:02,777 --> 01:12:04,620
almost whoever you are

1046
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,697
because of its humanity.

1047
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:18,634
- I, myself, don't
recognize the word jazz.

1048
01:12:18,635 --> 01:12:21,086
I mean, we're sold under this name,

1049
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:23,886
but to me, the word doesn't exist.

1050
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:27,806
I just feel that I play John Coltrane.

1051
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:37,310
I think the main thing a
musician would like to do

1052
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,232
is give a picture to the listener

1053
01:12:39,233 --> 01:12:41,824
of the many wonderful things he knows of

1054
01:12:41,825 --> 01:12:43,989
and senses in the universe.

1055
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:46,361
That's what music is to me.

1056
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:48,238
It's just another way of saying

1057
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,825
this is a big, beautiful
universe we live in

1058
01:12:51,826 --> 01:12:53,828
that's been given to us,

1059
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:57,795
and here's an example
of just how magnificent

1060
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,917
and encompassing it is.

1061
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:06,057
- John Coltrane, he was outward bound

1062
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,176
the way he was playing.

1063
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:12,309
He could get in his
spaceship, metaphorically,

1064
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:16,433
and it could take him
anywhere he wanted to go.

1065
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,232
That's the way he was.

1066
01:13:20,271 --> 01:13:22,272
- One of the most incredible chapters

1067
01:13:22,273 --> 01:13:24,867
in John Coltrane's life is 1965,

1068
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:28,037
'cause he has achieved a level of success

1069
01:13:28,038 --> 01:13:30,322
that includes Grammy nominations;

1070
01:13:30,323 --> 01:13:33,247
he's been inducted into
the downbeat Hall of Fame,

1071
01:13:33,248 --> 01:13:36,870
one of the very first
living jazz musicians

1072
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:38,919
to be afforded that honor;

1073
01:13:39,123 --> 01:13:43,344
he has an outstanding best-selling
album in A Love Supreme.

1074
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:47,427
There is an awareness that is starting

1075
01:13:47,428 --> 01:13:50,848
to creep into all levels of music fandom

1076
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,189
and he starts to dismantle that

1077
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:59,225
because he is now gonna
try new musical ideas.

1078
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:01,227
Musical ideas that are not popular,

1079
01:14:01,228 --> 01:14:04,573
musical ideas that challenge most ears,

1080
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:07,025
musical ideas that, in effect,

1081
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:10,030
will take apart his classic quartet.

1082
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:13,958
By the end of 1965 he
will lose Elvin Jones

1083
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:17,035
and McCoy Tyner because of this new path

1084
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:18,620
that he is going along.

1085
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:21,919
And he will replace them
with a very young drummer

1086
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,294
named Rashied Ali from Philadelphia,

1087
01:14:24,295 --> 01:14:27,587
and his wife, Alice Coltrane, on piano.

1088
01:14:27,588 --> 01:14:29,010
And he'll expand the band

1089
01:14:29,011 --> 01:14:32,550
and bring in a second
horn with Pharaoh Sanders.

1090
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:36,179
- Here's the thing, John
Coltrane went from bebop

1091
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:39,184
to Miles Davis Quintet, modern cool,

1092
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:42,361
to his own quartet.

1093
01:14:42,853 --> 01:14:45,151
He went the whole transition.

1094
01:14:45,272 --> 01:14:46,773
So he could play standards.

1095
01:14:46,774 --> 01:14:50,360
He had the right to go out
as far as he wanted.

1096
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:54,582
- John Coltrane's sound
rearranges molecular structure.

1097
01:14:54,949 --> 01:14:56,747
People are like what.

1098
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:18,098
- Some said that he's taking
jazz in the wrong direction

1099
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,684
which is of course a lie.

1100
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,773
He's taking it forward.

1101
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:25,937
And the reason you're not aware of it,

1102
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,987
because you've never heard it before.

1103
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,988
- Coltrane was definitely
one of the scientists

1104
01:15:32,989 --> 01:15:35,365
of the saxophone, someone who was pushing

1105
01:15:35,366 --> 01:15:36,990
the instrument to its limit.

1106
01:15:36,991 --> 01:15:38,959
Kinda of what Jimi Hendrix would later do

1107
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,749
with the electric guitar.

1108
01:15:45,958 --> 01:15:47,879
- I don't care what the critics say.

1109
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:49,002
If you like it, you like it.

1110
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:50,505
If you don't, you don't.

1111
01:15:55,009 --> 01:15:57,558
He may have been reaching
for something else

1112
01:15:57,559 --> 01:16:00,898
spiritually, that they don't understand.

1113
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:06,019
- He was brave enough and had the courage

1114
01:16:06,020 --> 01:16:08,022
to never doubt himself.

1115
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,032
What was more of a concern for him

1116
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:14,154
was he has to be as authentic
as he could possibly be.

1117
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:22,128
- Would you want him to tiptoe
to where he's trying to get?

1118
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:24,455
You know, John Coltrane,

1119
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:28,175
you know, he's mean.

1120
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,404
- Ya, I do understand it.

1121
01:16:58,405 --> 01:16:59,572
I'm open to it.

1122
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:00,415
I try to embrace it.

1123
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:02,075
I try to follow it.

1124
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,077
I just proceed on the premise

1125
01:17:04,078 --> 01:17:07,082
that I'm not prepared to fully grasp

1126
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:10,917
all the creativity that's taking place.

1127
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:14,047
If it's Coltrane, I already
have a certain trust,

1128
01:17:14,048 --> 01:17:15,967
but it's not the kind of music

1129
01:17:15,968 --> 01:17:18,093
I would just sit there and
listen to all the time.

1130
01:17:18,094 --> 01:17:20,260
I got to really, gotta zero in

1131
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,105
and I still don't fully
grasp what's going on.

1132
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,899
- Coltrane thought it was
cleansing and uplifting,

1133
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:36,117
but that's not what people heard.

1134
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,783
What they heard was shrieking.

1135
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,202
- Later when I saw him play,

1136
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:50,424
I would say half the audience
left before it was over.

1137
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:53,924
They just didn't know.

1138
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:58,173
They were witnessing
something ahead of its time,

1139
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:00,550
something spiritual but cathartic,

1140
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,680
and tumultuous, and I just ate it up.

1141
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,150
He could go to Mars, I'm with him.

1142
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:17,156
- I have no fear about my
music being too way out.

1143
01:18:17,157 --> 01:18:19,152
My goals remain the same

1144
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:22,363
and that is to uplift
people as much as I can,

1145
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,789
to inspire them to realize more and more

1146
01:18:26,785 --> 01:18:30,790
of their capacities for
living meaningful lives,

1147
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:34,928
because there certainly
is meaning to life.

1148
01:19:33,227 --> 01:19:34,774
- I was a first year student

1149
01:19:34,775 --> 01:19:37,730
in junior high school when it happened.

1150
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:41,736
The explosion took place
at precisely 11:02 a.m.

1151
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,030
50 meters up in the air.

1152
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,116
I saw the flash and gazed

1153
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:51,327
at the center of that overpowering light.

1154
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:54,958
And at that time, a powerful force hit me,

1155
01:19:56,208 --> 01:20:00,258
lifting my body up and
flinging it across the room.

1156
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,761
The earth was shaking.

1157
01:20:03,257 --> 01:20:05,134
The heat was intense.

1158
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,854
Much of Nagasaki vanished.

1159
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:13,730
Perhaps as many as 75,000
people died instantly

1160
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:17,897
and another 75,000 were wounded

1161
01:20:18,856 --> 01:20:21,450
and exposed to massive radiation

1162
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,194
and an uncertain future.

1163
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:39,043
- I dislike war, period.

1164
01:20:39,293 --> 01:20:41,796
So therefore, as far as I'm concerned,

1165
01:20:41,797 --> 01:20:43,092
it should stop.

1166
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,235
- It was July 14, 1966

1167
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,567
when I went to pick up John Coltrane

1168
01:21:04,568 --> 01:21:07,695
and his musicians at the train station.

1169
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:10,495
Everyone came out except Coltrane.

1170
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,454
I looked all over for him
and found him in a car

1171
01:21:14,455 --> 01:21:17,798
of the express train playing the flute.

1172
01:21:18,332 --> 01:21:19,959
I was so surprised.

1173
01:21:20,334 --> 01:21:23,304
Then, he looked at me and grinned.

1174
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:26,339
I asked him a question.

1175
01:21:26,340 --> 01:21:29,092
"Why were you playing the flute?"

1176
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,720
He said that he was searching

1177
01:21:30,721 --> 01:21:32,938
for the sound of Nagasaki.

1178
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,268
I was extremely moved by this.

1179
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:42,063
I asked him if he wanted
to go straight to his hotel

1180
01:21:42,064 --> 01:21:43,361
and he said no.

1181
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:48,704
He said he wanted to go to
the atomic bomb hypo-center.

1182
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:52,204
For me, that place is sacred.

1183
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:55,377
It's the same as a grave site.

1184
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:11,556
He took a wreath of flowers

1185
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:14,846
and put it down in front of the pillar.

1186
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:17,726
And then he stood up and he prayed.

1187
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:21,521
He was praying and looking up at the sky.

1188
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:25,237
He just kept staring up above the pillar

1189
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:28,278
for a considerable amount of time.

1190
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,738
I asked him why and he replied

1191
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,707
that he was imagining the sounds,

1192
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,665
the plane, the bomb, the suffering

1193
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:38,912
of the Japanese people.

1194
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:41,586
I think that Coltrane has studied

1195
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:44,959
about all of these things,
and for that reason,

1196
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:49,181
he chose to come to Nagasaki
on his Japanese tour.

1197
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:05,438
- My name is Yasuhiro
Fujioka, but known as Fuji

1198
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:09,660
because of very long and
difficult name for foreigners.

1199
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:13,705
So, everybody calls me
Fuji, like Mt. Fuji.

1200
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,720
I'm a journalist, a lecturer,

1201
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:30,714
a businessman, and chef.

1202
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:35,473
I'm also the author of four
books on John Coltrane.

1203
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:39,807
I admit it, I am obsessed
by John Coltrane.

1204
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:43,476
I am the number one collector

1205
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:46,230
of memorabilia of John Coltrane.

1206
01:23:47,481 --> 01:23:49,148
I was in high school

1207
01:23:49,149 --> 01:23:52,494
when I heard John Coltrane on the radio.

1208
01:23:53,195 --> 01:23:55,197
This music blew my mind.

1209
01:24:01,078 --> 01:24:03,627
The next day I rushed to the record shop,

1210
01:24:03,628 --> 01:24:05,841
the smallest in the world.

1211
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:09,168
More than 40 years later I still go there.

1212
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:12,890
That day I buy my first
John Coltrane record.

1213
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,561
This is the album.

1214
01:24:18,554 --> 01:24:20,977
This is John Coltrane's Ole.

1215
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:27,520
So within maybe five, six, seven years

1216
01:24:27,521 --> 01:24:31,492
I became a complete
collector of John Coltrane.

1217
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:38,536
Then I decide to travel
all over the world.

1218
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:43,629
So now, almost four months a
year or five months a year,

1219
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:47,337
I'm abroad, still chasing Trane.

1220
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:49,709
Ooh!

1221
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:52,211
Wow!

1222
01:24:53,547 --> 01:24:56,050
I have a special passion for photographs,

1223
01:24:56,051 --> 01:24:59,178
posters, books, and tapes and vinyls,

1224
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:03,306
anything John Coltrane
that catches my eye.

1225
01:25:03,307 --> 01:25:05,435
My collection is so large

1226
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:09,312
that I had to build John
Coltrane house in Osaka

1227
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,565
to store it all.

1228
01:25:13,317 --> 01:25:17,072
I want to listen to the music
of John Coltrane every day.

1229
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:19,947
Every day and every evening, every night.

1230
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,074
Every moment.

1231
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:24,874
Surrounding Coltrane music and surrounding

1232
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:28,170
by the photographs and the memorabilia.

1233
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,632
Makes me happy.

1234
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:38,174
When John Coltrane came to Japan

1235
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:42,011
it was not an easy flight
from America in those days.

1236
01:25:42,012 --> 01:25:44,606
And his schedule was so tight,

1237
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:48,861
16 shows in 17 days in
cities all over the country.

1238
01:25:50,354 --> 01:25:53,564
He was giving his life
to the people of Japan,

1239
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,567
spending so much energy.

1240
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:58,654
That was his last tour.

1241
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:23,145
- Coltrane's concert in
Nagasaki was something special.

1242
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:26,639
I was the announcer that night.

1243
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:29,644
The second song was Peace On Earth.

1244
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:34,653
He must have wanted to
perform that here in Nagasaki.

1245
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:39,661
The whole concert hall was
totally caught up in Coltrane.

1246
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,952
It was an amazing atmosphere.

1247
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:47,660
- Why John Coltrane is so special for me

1248
01:26:47,661 --> 01:26:51,586
is he came to Japan, he
played Peace On Earth.

1249
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,127
At that time we were still so struggling

1250
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:58,130
from the atomic bombing,

1251
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:00,256
and many people are still struggling,

1252
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:03,682
and Coltrane was so kind to play for us.

1253
01:27:13,687 --> 01:27:16,941
Coltrane composed the song Peace On Earth

1254
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:21,195
almost as requiem for
victim of the atomic bomb,

1255
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:24,615
as well as his wish to stop all war.

1256
01:27:30,996 --> 01:27:32,418
That made me so,

1257
01:27:33,957 --> 01:27:35,959
I don't know how to say,

1258
01:27:38,587 --> 01:27:39,587
more,

1259
01:27:40,714 --> 01:27:42,882
I can't say enough.

1260
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:44,305
I have no words.

1261
01:27:57,647 --> 01:27:59,991
His passion was peace and love

1262
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,157
for the universe.

1263
01:28:41,274 --> 01:28:45,495
- You know, the last time I
talked to John on the phone,

1264
01:28:47,781 --> 01:28:49,249
his voice sounded,

1265
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:53,411
it sounded...

1266
01:29:12,806 --> 01:29:15,850
- There were indications
by the end of 1966

1267
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:19,812
and into '67 that Coltrane
wasn't doing well.

1268
01:29:19,813 --> 01:29:21,897
His side men later would report

1269
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:25,484
that he was holding his
side like he was in pain.

1270
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:29,740
And sure enough, he was later
diagnosed with liver cancer.

1271
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:34,451
- At first when Coltrane died,

1272
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:36,620
I think it was just shock.

1273
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,419
I mean, he was only 40

1274
01:29:38,540 --> 01:29:41,840
and he hadn't been ill for a long time.

1275
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:52,604
- My mother did speak of
John's death in this way,

1276
01:29:52,605 --> 01:29:55,520
which it was, this just floored me,

1277
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,851
she said,

1278
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:00,862
"it was beautiful.

1279
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,862
"It was warm and the
breath went out of him.

1280
01:30:04,863 --> 01:30:06,986
"He was not in any pain."

1281
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:10,863
She said at the very, this
is the moment of transition,

1282
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:12,948
she used the word beautiful.

1283
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:15,873
That's how she revealed it to me.

1284
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:26,086
- All the things flashed through my mind

1285
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:28,306
that we had done together.

1286
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:30,972
And I went into my apartment,

1287
01:30:30,973 --> 01:30:33,311
I shut the door, and cried.

1288
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:38,891
Boy...

1289
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:42,069
It was rough.

1290
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:45,606
Phew.

1291
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:48,819
That really got me.

1292
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:53,574
And you can see it's getting me now.

1293
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:55,074
I'm sorry.

1294
01:31:19,933 --> 01:31:21,934
- I was at the funeral.

1295
01:31:21,935 --> 01:31:24,939
They wanted me to be a pallbearer,

1296
01:31:25,647 --> 01:31:27,945
but man, I could not do it.

1297
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:29,530
I looked at him

1298
01:31:31,027 --> 01:31:32,244
in the casket,

1299
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:37,956
and the way he was embalmed and all that.

1300
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:42,297
Only thing I recognized was his hands.

1301
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:53,966
He had fingers that went kinda strange,

1302
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:55,512
'cause I been looking' at his hands,

1303
01:31:55,513 --> 01:31:57,386
we'd been practicing together,

1304
01:31:57,387 --> 01:32:01,517
and that's the only thing
that reminded me of Trane.

1305
01:32:03,143 --> 01:32:04,861
So that wasn't him.

1306
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:07,982
He had passed on to the next place.

1307
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:10,992
His spirit was gone.

1308
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:21,586
- John was my best friend.

1309
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:25,628
It wasn't like 99% of other people.

1310
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:29,757
He existed in the real world.

1311
01:32:29,919 --> 01:32:32,463
I mean, he had a family, he had kids,

1312
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:34,882
but that's not where he was at.

1313
01:32:34,883 --> 01:32:36,635
He was not in the real world.

1314
01:32:36,636 --> 01:32:38,557
He was someplace else.

1315
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:40,646
So he's cool.

1316
01:32:42,515 --> 01:32:43,515
He's cool.

1317
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:45,314
He was cool when he was here

1318
01:32:45,315 --> 01:32:47,144
and he's cool in the big picture.

1319
01:32:47,145 --> 01:32:48,145
He's cool.

1320
01:32:59,324 --> 01:33:03,454
- Since Trane passed away,
his music has transcended,

1321
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:06,840
and it's more and more known, people...

1322
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:10,044
That type of artistic
achievement stays around.

1323
01:33:10,045 --> 01:33:13,420
It's mythic because of
the sacrifice involved,

1324
01:33:13,421 --> 01:33:15,640
and it will remain mythic.

1325
01:33:16,049 --> 01:33:18,846
- If you go to any kind of
comprehensive retrospective

1326
01:33:18,847 --> 01:33:21,683
of Picasso's art, it's
breathtaking what he did,

1327
01:33:21,684 --> 01:33:24,102
how he went from being a
very good traditional painter

1328
01:33:24,103 --> 01:33:26,391
to the Blue period, his abstract,

1329
01:33:26,392 --> 01:33:28,268
and then his cubist work.

1330
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:30,984
If you think about what John Coltrane did,

1331
01:33:30,985 --> 01:33:34,450
moving through his various
phases of musical creativity,

1332
01:33:34,451 --> 01:33:37,319
he basically did everything Picasso did

1333
01:33:37,320 --> 01:33:39,743
in about 50 years less time.

1334
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:41,742
And I just think that

1335
01:33:41,743 --> 01:33:43,709
if you've got any kind of love for music

1336
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:45,795
and regard for the craft,

1337
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:47,748
you hear three or four notes and say

1338
01:33:47,749 --> 01:33:51,092
this man owns his horn, owns his music,

1339
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:57,094
and at least when he's playing,
is the master of his soul.

1340
01:33:58,424 --> 01:34:01,093
- His spirit is still very much alive

1341
01:34:01,094 --> 01:34:04,012
and he's saying, "I'm gonna use music

1342
01:34:04,013 --> 01:34:07,187
"to try to convince you to grasp in time

1343
01:34:07,642 --> 01:34:10,644
"a love supreme so you that don't remain

1344
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,773
"just a prisoner of time.

1345
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,107
"You will be a maker, a creator

1346
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,826
"of a better world."

1347
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:19,113
That is a Coltrane version

1348
01:34:19,529 --> 01:34:21,782
of what he learned in Sunday school,

1349
01:34:21,783 --> 01:34:23,829
was he was taught that the kingdom of God

1350
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:26,743
is within you and everywhere you go,

1351
01:34:26,744 --> 01:34:29,997
you oughta leave a little heaven behind.

1352
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,467
And he left some heaven behind.

1353
01:34:35,128 --> 01:34:38,964
- To be a musician is really something.

1354
01:34:38,965 --> 01:34:40,967
It goes very, very deep.

1355
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:47,148
My music is the spiritual
expression of what I am,

1356
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,314
my faith, my knowledge, my being.

1357
01:34:51,978 --> 01:34:54,149
I know that there are bad forces.

1358
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:55,820
I know that there are forces out here

1359
01:34:55,821 --> 01:34:58,066
that bring suffering to others

1360
01:34:58,067 --> 01:35:00,069
and misery to the world,

1361
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:03,155
but I wanna be the opposite force.

1362
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:07,161
I want to be the force
which is truly for good.
