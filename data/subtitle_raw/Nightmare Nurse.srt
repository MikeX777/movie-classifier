1
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:35,620
Come on, people!

2
00:00:35,644 --> 00:00:37,665
The clock is ticking!

3
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:41,887
So Brooke, this is our
Friday night special?

4
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:43,579
I thought a little
prosciutto would compliment

5
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,271
the shrimp and the
sun-dried tomatoes.

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,384
Hm...

7
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:51,790
Black olive tapenade.

8
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,988
That's a bold move
on a dish like this.

9
00:00:56,012 --> 00:00:57,753
It was just a taste.

10
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,691
It's too busy. You hate it.

11
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:06,781
I hate that you've made
something more interesting

12
00:01:06,805 --> 00:01:09,523
than anything we've had on the
specials in the last four months.

13
00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:10,940
You're my new sous chef.

14
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:15,814
It's a creme brulee,
not a French...

15
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:24,538
Oh, you got my text.

16
00:01:24,562 --> 00:01:25,887
Thank you for the heads up.

17
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,150
Is that for me?

18
00:01:27,174 --> 00:01:29,326
Connie, what would Larry say?

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,892
If that was from Buttery Bakery,

20
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:32,546
he'd thank you with
his mouth full.

21
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,679
She's at the bar.

22
00:01:34,703 --> 00:01:37,029
She's gonna love it.

23
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:39,186
- Go get 'er, tiger.
- Thanks, Connie.

24
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:46,169
New Zealand...

25
00:01:46,193 --> 00:01:47,672
Looks like you have a fan club.

26
00:01:49,065 --> 00:01:50,347
Congrats, baby.

27
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,175
Lance! Hey.

28
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,828
Oh, my god. How did you know?

29
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,265
- Connie.
- Yeah...

30
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,440
well don't party too hard.

31
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:57,789
You have a big night tomorrow.

32
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,182
I'm looking forward to it.

33
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,227
- Thanks, Chef.
- Yeah, don't thank me yet.

34
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:03,166
My right hand is the
one I usually burn.

35
00:02:04,428 --> 00:02:06,145
Bye, Marco.

36
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,452
Oh, flowers!

37
00:02:08,476 --> 00:02:10,976
But it's not even our
two year anniversary.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,088
It has been one week since
you moved in, though.

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,200
Mm.

40
00:02:13,224 --> 00:02:15,589
And a salted caramel cake?

41
00:02:15,613 --> 00:02:17,113
That's my favorite.

42
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,724
Not bad, Mr. Boston.

43
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:22,248
I am really proud of you.

44
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:23,404
Thanks, baby.

45
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,689
All right, a beer for me,
and a shot of tequila

46
00:02:28,713 --> 00:02:30,169
for the sexy top chef.

47
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,692
What are you doing?

48
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:32,824
Celebrating your promotion.

49
00:02:32,848 --> 00:02:34,347
Come on.

50
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,958
Well in that case, make
it two shots of tequila.

51
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:38,438
Okay.

52
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,528
What? Now that you're here,
I'm not driving home.

53
00:02:41,552 --> 00:02:44,531
To your promotion
and to one week

54
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:45,915
of living together
without a fight.

55
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:51,258
Let's enjoy it while it lasts.

56
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:56,761
- And your second celebration shot.
- Oh, I'll grab it.

57
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,156
This one's to allhe amazing
food you're gonna cook for me.

58
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,268
Okay.

59
00:03:04,488 --> 00:03:06,771
I can't believe I
almost forgot my cake.

60
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,164
Your cake?

61
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,508
You're not gonna
share it with me?

62
00:03:11,103 --> 00:03:13,143
Okay, I thought we agreed
when we moved in together,

63
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:14,387
everything would be 50/50.

64
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,571
Uh, except for when you bring
home salted caramel cake.

65
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:17,782
Then it's a 70/30 split.

66
00:03:17,806 --> 00:03:19,827
Oh, okay. I see how it is.

67
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,394
Not cool.

68
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,767
Very cool!

69
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:28,208
♪ Some people want to have
their cake and eat it too ♪

70
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:34,059
♪ And after I take my bite
I give the rest to you ♪

71
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:35,626
How's the paper coming along?

72
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,802
Still got a ways to go.

73
00:03:37,826 --> 00:03:39,282
But good news is, it
looks like we're getting

74
00:03:39,306 --> 00:03:40,626
another grant from
the university,

75
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,806
so I'll have more time.

76
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,590
- How much?
- I don't know.

77
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:45,288
$20,000 I think.

78
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,506
Nice.

79
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,595
That should buy you some time.

80
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:50,339
Yeah, but as much as I
enjoy the sabbatical,

81
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,772
I miss the students.

82
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,596
It'll be nice when I can
get back to teaching.

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,950
Or you know, we could just...

84
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:59,040
get married now and
start having kids?

85
00:03:59,064 --> 00:04:00,912
Um...

86
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:02,914
I just got promoted.

87
00:04:02,938 --> 00:04:05,395
Are you gonna be a
stay-at-home dad?

88
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,484
- I could learn to lactate.
- All right.

89
00:04:07,508 --> 00:04:09,074
Here.

90
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:13,165
Lance!

91
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:40,114
Lance! Lance!

92
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:43,030
- Take it easy, Ms. Harmon.
- Lance is going to be okay.

93
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:45,206
You're in the hospital,
but everything is okay.

94
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,947
Where is he? I wanna see him.

95
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,122
And you will.

96
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,666
He's recovering from
surgery right now.

97
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,256
Surgery? What happened to him?

98
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,476
You were both in an accident.

99
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,261
You suffered a laceration to
your ribs, and your friend...

100
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,132
- Lance. His name is Lance.
- Okay.

101
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,134
Lance fractured his femur.

102
00:07:00,158 --> 00:07:01,788
What? What happened to us?

103
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,703
You were in a car accident.

104
00:07:03,727 --> 00:07:04,927
He was pinned behind the wheel

105
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,605
when the EMTs arrived
on the scene.

106
00:07:09,124 --> 00:07:11,189
Wh...

107
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:12,799
What about... What
about the man?

108
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,063
What about the man in the road?

109
00:07:14,087 --> 00:07:15,672
I'm sorry?

110
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:18,675
The two of you were
brought in alone.

111
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,265
There was nobody with you.

112
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,332
Okay.

113
00:07:24,356 --> 00:07:26,968
I'm gonna send the
doctor in to see you...

114
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:30,077
and then we'll see
what we can do

115
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:33,429
about taking you to
see Lance, okay?

116
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,802
Here we go.

117
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,303
Thank you, Barb...

118
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:39,720
Barbara.

119
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,679
Thank you, Barbara.

120
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:46,727
You can call be Barb.

121
00:08:00,131 --> 00:08:02,090
- He's right in there.
- Thank you.

122
00:08:08,139 --> 00:08:10,161
- Hey.
- Hi.

123
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,684
I've been waiting for you.

124
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,188
How are you feeling?

125
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:17,037
Like crap.

126
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:18,976
But the drugs have helped.

127
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,478
How are you feeling?

128
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,088
I'm fine.

129
00:08:24,112 --> 00:08:25,916
I'm just glad you're okay.

130
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,396
I'm so sorry, baby.

131
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,224
Don't be sorry.

132
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,531
- I didn't see him until the last second...
- Lance...

133
00:08:32,555 --> 00:08:34,272
it was an accident.

134
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:35,819
He jumped out into the road.

135
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:41,876
Sorry to bother you guys, but there's
a Detective Thames here to see you.

136
00:08:44,175 --> 00:08:45,892
Okay. Send him in.

137
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,396
- Right this way.
- Thanks. Thank you.

138
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:50,593
Hi. Pardon the interruption.

139
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,595
I just need a minute to collect

140
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,119
an official statement regarding
the accident, all right?

141
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,536
Of course.

142
00:08:58,102 --> 00:08:59,782
Do we know what happened
to the man we hit?

143
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,068
Yeah, is he gonna be okay?

144
00:09:04,456 --> 00:09:05,651
You know, I...

145
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,285
I'm sorry.

146
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:12,397
But you'll be glad to know
that your blood alcohol test

147
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,312
came back below the legal limit.

148
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,856
So as of right now, I am only here
to get an official statement.

149
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,123
All right?

150
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:29,327
Bottom line, Brooke,
is you guys need to be

151
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:31,068
incredibly thankful
that you survived.

152
00:09:31,092 --> 00:09:33,200
I know.

153
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:34,854
Just can't believe he died.

154
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,682
It wasn't your fault.

155
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,839
That guy jumped out
in front of your car.

156
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:44,081
I guarantee you
they will find out

157
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,126
he was hopped up on something.

158
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,867
He could have
killed both of you.

159
00:09:47,891 --> 00:09:49,956
I texted you Gwen's number.

160
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,479
Besides being
Marco's girlfriend,

161
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,143
she is the best attorney
on the West Side.

162
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:54,265
Oh, my god.

163
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:56,136
I haven't even spoken to Marco.

164
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,573
No worries.

165
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,139
He just wants you to heal up

166
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:01,098
and come back when you're ready.

167
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:02,962
Sorry to interrupt. I
need to change your pack.

168
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:06,103
Hey Connie, let
me call you back.

169
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:07,234
Thanks again.

170
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:08,303
Okay. Bye.

171
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:20,881
Are you okay?

172
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,294
Yeah.

173
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:24,600
Sorry.

174
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,167
I'm just having one
of those days.

175
00:10:27,191 --> 00:10:29,387
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Lost a patient.

176
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:32,303
She's had a heart disease
for a long time,

177
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:33,696
but she finally died last night.

178
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,880
She was one of our favorites.

179
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:36,350
I'm so sorry.

180
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:38,048
Well, it goes with
the territory.

181
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:39,752
You'd think I'd be used
to it, but I'm not.

182
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:42,966
In happier news...

183
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,271
I heard that you and Lance are
gonna be released tomorrow.

184
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,688
Yeah.

185
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,997
I'm so happy that Lance is okay.

186
00:10:54,741 --> 00:10:57,807
It's important to know that
your loved ones are safe.

187
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,113
Hey, um...

188
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,941
I was informed that
Lance would need

189
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,726
an in-home nurse for
a couple of weeks.

190
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,110
I was wondering if
that's something

191
00:11:05,134 --> 00:11:06,772
they give you leave to do?

192
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,122
Unfortunately no, but
we do have a database

193
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:11,951
of referrals from the different
insurance companies.

194
00:11:11,975 --> 00:11:13,692
We can help you set that up.

195
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:16,347
Okay. Thank you.

196
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,243
- Drink some water.
- Okay.

197
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:22,507
Feel better.

198
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,363
Brooke! Hey!

199
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:34,067
I'm glad I caught you
guys before you left.

200
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:36,367
So look, we found you
a pre-approved nurse

201
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:39,022
under your insurance provider for
up to six weeks of in-home care.

202
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,545
She can do physical
therapy, too.

203
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:42,025
Great! Thank you.

204
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:43,548
Definitely. You guys take care.

205
00:11:43,572 --> 00:11:44,941
- You, too.
- Yeah. Thanks, Paul.

206
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,682
All right...

207
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,466
Ready to get out of here?

208
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,840
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.

209
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:08,466
- Okay...
- Okay...

210
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,712
Oh, god. Okay.

211
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,911
All right.

212
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,196
Thank God for oxy.

213
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,308
Are you okay?

214
00:12:25,483 --> 00:12:26,528
Yeah.

215
00:12:28,008 --> 00:12:29,488
Are you sure you don't
want me to hang

216
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:31,378
around for just a
couple of more days?

217
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:33,424
We can postpone
this nurse thing.

218
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:34,841
No, babe. I'll be fine.

219
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,626
Stop worrying so much.

220
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:42,128
You need to get back to
your big new promotion.

221
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,521
I know.

222
00:12:43,545 --> 00:12:45,436
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

223
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,916
Oh, I know.

224
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,048
But I'll have this new nurse.

225
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,833
I'll be fine.

226
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:53,705
She's coming by for an
interview in the morning.

227
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,533
She sounded really
nice on the phone.

228
00:12:55,557 --> 00:12:57,753
Wonderful.

229
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,406
Is there anything you
need from school?

230
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,990
I can pick it up for
you in the morning.

231
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,061
No, I think I'm okay.

232
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:03,541
I got everything I
need on my laptop.

233
00:13:03,565 --> 00:13:05,891
I called the school this
morning and told them

234
00:13:05,915 --> 00:13:08,024
I'd keep working from home.

235
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:09,808
They're having me
rebuild the site.

236
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,375
- Mm!
- Yeah.

237
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:13,439
Well, you're the best cyber
builder in the business.

238
00:13:13,463 --> 00:13:14,725
That's me.

239
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,817
If I didn't have this
stupid leg thing,

240
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,080
I'd rebuild your site right now.

241
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:22,647
What does that even mean?

242
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:24,257
I have no idea.

243
00:13:24,281 --> 00:13:25,781
- Mm.
- Come here.

244
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,805
Okay.

245
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,482
Okay. Careful.

246
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:32,506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

247
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:36,728
Oh, this feels so good.

248
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:40,578
It's good to be home.

249
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:42,212
It's good to be home.

250
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,705
All right...

251
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,728
I'm sure it won't be as
good as the hospital food,

252
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,035
but just give it a shot.

253
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:04,732
Oh, babe. Thank you.

254
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,865
- It looks amazing.
- Mm-hmm.

255
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:10,347
Look listen, when I heal up,
let's go take a trip somewhere.

256
00:14:10,371 --> 00:14:12,218
That little inn
in Santa Barbara?

257
00:14:12,242 --> 00:14:14,177
Oh, yes.

258
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,700
The one where we
lock ourselves in

259
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,920
all weekend like
hibernating cubs?

260
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:20,052
Oh.

261
00:14:20,076 --> 00:14:23,447
And that would be your
prospective nurse.

262
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,255
I'll get it.

263
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:31,281
Hi. I'm Chloe.

264
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:34,458
Hi, Chloe. I'm Brooke.

265
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:36,808
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

266
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,505
Why don't you come on in?

267
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:39,704
Okay.

268
00:14:51,934 --> 00:14:53,607
- Oh, very smooth.
- Oh, my.

269
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:56,088
Uh... paper towels in there?

270
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:58,743
- I got it.
- Oh please, it's my job.

271
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,266
Oh, god.

272
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,834
I didn't know Maxim
Magazine staffed nurses.

273
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,599
Not laughing.

274
00:15:09,256 --> 00:15:10,537
- There.
- Thanks.

275
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,191
Yeah. You might wanna...

276
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:13,932
I'll grab that.

277
00:15:13,956 --> 00:15:16,437
Thanks, but I'm not
a complete invalid.

278
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:19,546
You must be Lance.

279
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,876
It's nice to meet you, Chloe.

280
00:15:22,138 --> 00:15:24,421
How's the leg feeling today?

281
00:15:24,445 --> 00:15:29,382
Sore and stiff but...
better than yesterday.

282
00:15:29,406 --> 00:15:31,036
That's normal.

283
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,473
Your report said you suffered
a nasty femoral fracture.

284
00:15:33,497 --> 00:15:35,562
Yeah. It wasn't pretty.

285
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,458
Why don't you have
a seat, Chloe?

286
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,786
Can I get you anything to drink?

287
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,223
Uh... no. I'm good. Thanks.

288
00:15:44,247 --> 00:15:46,573
So how long have you
been doing this for?

289
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:50,969
Oh, practically my whole life. Um...
my parents worked a lot,

290
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:53,015
- so I looked after my sick grandmother...
- Ow!

291
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,359
From the time that I was eight.

292
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,758
Um... I realized then

293
00:15:57,782 --> 00:15:59,282
that this was what
I wanted to be.

294
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:02,546
I went to nursing school
right out of high school

295
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:05,288
and 23 patients
later, here I am!

296
00:16:05,312 --> 00:16:07,183
Oh, sorry.

297
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,032
Of course.

298
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,337
What?

299
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:13,687
Renee and Alejandro
called in sick.

300
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:16,168
I wasn't supposed to go
back until tomorrow.

301
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:18,272
Uh, I've got nothing planned
for the rest of the day.

302
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,346
I'd be happy to
look after Lance.

303
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,210
- You could think of it as a trial run.
- Oh...

304
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,308
- Really?
- Go.

305
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:27,266
I'll be fine, babe.

306
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,900
Go do your sous chef thing.

307
00:16:31,381 --> 00:16:32,880
Are you sure you don't mind?

308
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:34,099
Of course not.

309
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,448
Okay.

310
00:16:35,472 --> 00:16:38,277
Well in that case then, um...

311
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,181
let's go in the kitchen
and I'll run you through

312
00:16:40,205 --> 00:16:42,045
- his meds and his allergies and stuff.
- Okay.

313
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:54,990
Come on, people working!

314
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,080
Well, it seems like I don't need
to find a replacement after all.

315
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,168
As if you could.

316
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:01,170
Brooke, I need you to dazzle me

317
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,781
with an appetizer for
tonight's special, okay?

318
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,478
It's nice to have you back.

319
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,089
I'm glad you're okay.

320
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,134
Work for me!

321
00:17:09,158 --> 00:17:11,136
He did miss you, you know.

322
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,791
Yeah, I can tell.

323
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,184
So how's Lance doing?

324
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:16,707
Better.

325
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:18,883
We got him all set up in
the den, a little ramp...

326
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:20,145
He's good to go.

327
00:17:20,169 --> 00:17:22,626
And how's the nurse
search comin'?

328
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,570
Actually, we have someone
watching him right now.

329
00:17:24,594 --> 00:17:26,456
Uh, she seems very competent.

330
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,414
And very stunning.

331
00:17:28,438 --> 00:17:30,112
Uh-oh.

332
00:17:30,136 --> 00:17:32,679
No. I totally trust Lance.

333
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,986
Just like he totally trusts me.

334
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,230
Okay.

335
00:17:38,405 --> 00:17:41,103
It's just... men are men.

336
00:17:42,846 --> 00:17:45,127
That's probably the most brilliant
thing you've ever said.

337
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:47,390
I mean, it's in their
genetic make up.

338
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,720
They can't help themselves.

339
00:17:51,374 --> 00:17:53,396
Lance can.

340
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,137
Well, the good news
is he's got you,

341
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,964
so why would he want
anyone else, right?

342
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,033
Right.

343
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:07,801
Hey.

344
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,673
Hey, babe.

345
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,196
How are you feeling?

346
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,025
Actually, it's the most
comfortable I've felt yet.

347
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:15,659
Oh, that's great.

348
00:18:18,227 --> 00:18:20,379
Oh, sorry.

349
00:18:20,403 --> 00:18:21,380
Hi, Brooke!

350
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,774
Hey, Chloe.

351
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:25,471
Did you do laundry, too?

352
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:26,951
Yeah. You know, there were just

353
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,095
a few loads in there, so I
figured I'd just, you know.

354
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,825
Are you kidding me?
Thank you so much.

355
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:34,176
Should I take 'em upstairs?

356
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,787
No. Put it down. I'll
take care of it.

357
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:38,180
Are you sure?

358
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,790
It's not a problem.

359
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,974
Chloe, you weren't even
supposed to come to work today.

360
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:42,975
I think you've done enough.

361
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:44,664
Okay.

362
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,492
So can you come back
tomorrow at 9:00?

363
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:49,278
Absolutely. Thank you.

364
00:18:49,302 --> 00:18:50,975
Happy to have you.

365
00:18:50,999 --> 00:18:52,542
Happy to be had.

366
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:54,239
And Lance is in good hands.

367
00:18:54,263 --> 00:18:55,656
I can see that.

368
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,678
So I brought home some dinner.

369
00:18:58,702 --> 00:18:59,984
Why don't you stay and join us?

370
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:03,161
Oh... Oh, gosh. No. That...
I... Thank you.

371
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:05,105
That's very kind of you,
but you guys should have

372
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:07,410
your time together and I need
to get back to my boyfriend.

373
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:08,775
It's my night to make dinner.

374
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,359
Oh. Well in that case, you'll have
to take some of this with you.

375
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:13,345
Save yourself the trouble.

376
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,739
Oh, wow. Thank you.

377
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:18,307
That... that is so sweet of you.
Thank you.

378
00:19:18,331 --> 00:19:19,525
All right.

379
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:21,223
Well, goodnight.

380
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,311
Goodnight, Lance!

381
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,399
Goodnight, Chloe.

382
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,685
- Bye.
- Bye!

383
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,166
Bye!

384
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:34,061
Right?

385
00:19:34,085 --> 00:19:36,000
That was better than I thought.

386
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,243
- I missed you.
- I missed you.

387
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,833
Get some of this.

388
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,895
We agreed no boots on the couch.

389
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,751
And you agreed you wouldn't see

390
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,840
anymore male patients
after the last one.

391
00:20:13,864 --> 00:20:16,800
Well, sometimes I
don't get a choice.

392
00:20:16,824 --> 00:20:18,565
Someone's gotta pay the
bills around here.

393
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:23,981
Was he good-looking?

394
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:25,461
Yep.

395
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:27,226
And so is his wife.

396
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,032
Seriously?

397
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:33,275
James, get off.

398
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:37,299
James, I said get off of me!
James!

399
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:39,823
James! James, get off!

400
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:41,477
James get...

401
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:42,589
Ah!

402
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,133
You'll need to
finish that by noon.

403
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:52,311
Diuresis.

404
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:55,377
Excuse me?

405
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,379
When a person is supplying
the shift of blood

406
00:21:57,403 --> 00:22:00,295
from the legs into the thorax,
it increases atrial stress,

407
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,123
stimulating the release of
ANP, which initiates diuresis,

408
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:04,560
leading to significant
water loss.

409
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:07,171
- Okay, you lost me at "When."
- Ha.

410
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,738
Sorry.

411
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:11,002
Sometimes I get a little carried
away with the tech talk.

412
00:22:11,026 --> 00:22:12,481
Um...

413
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:14,744
The bottom line is, because
you're on bed rest,

414
00:22:14,768 --> 00:22:16,572
there's an increase
of urine output

415
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,530
and less blood volume,
which means...

416
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:20,706
dehydration.

417
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,037
Drink up, my friend.

418
00:22:25,126 --> 00:22:27,955
Okay so, I made up
a little schedule.

419
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:31,978
We want to make sure the
only atrophy happens

420
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,241
on the bum leg and not
th rest of your body

421
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:37,157
and you should know that I combine
traditional nursing practices

422
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:39,334
with eastern
Nepalese philosophy,

423
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,074
which is not only
proven effective,

424
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:44,077
but has proven a
speedier recovery.

425
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:47,167
- Well, I'm all for a speedier recovery.
- I thought so.

426
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:49,344
All right. Let's get
started, shall we?

427
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,129
Kay, left hand out, please.

428
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:53,739
Keep the hand open.

429
00:22:53,763 --> 00:22:55,306
Okay.

430
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,700
So there's five major
pressure points on the hand

431
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:00,901
and the arm that serve as a
breaker box to the body.

432
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:06,535
Oh, I feel that in my low neck.

433
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,277
Good. Now you should feel
this one in your left side.

434
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:11,888
Oh, my god.

435
00:23:11,912 --> 00:23:14,194
Okay...

436
00:23:14,218 --> 00:23:16,980
And there's this one that
not only relieves pressure,

437
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:19,330
but it stimulates muscle
activity in your lower legs.

438
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:21,724
That's incredible.

439
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:23,750
Oh, I totally feel that.

440
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,667
Okay. And here's the last one.

441
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:55,119
You don't want to
overstimulate your body

442
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,624
on our first go around,
so just drink that water.

443
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,298
It was just weird.

444
00:24:14,322 --> 00:24:15,908
It's like a slap in the face.

445
00:24:15,932 --> 00:24:18,694
Literally the entire box
of pasta in the trash.

446
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,696
Well come on, maybe she's vegan

447
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,524
or lactose intolerant
and she didn't want

448
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,288
to come across
rude or flatulent.

449
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:27,093
Yeah, I guess you're right.

450
00:24:27,117 --> 00:24:28,399
I could be overreacting.

451
00:24:28,423 --> 00:24:30,488
You? No...

452
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,359
What? I don't overreact.

453
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,690
I don't overreact!

454
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:37,539
What?

455
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:38,651
I don't.

456
00:24:51,577 --> 00:24:52,902
Okay.

457
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,773
Hey Lance, I just got
a text from Brooke.

458
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:57,428
She said that she's
working late tonight.

459
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,039
What do you think you're doing?

460
00:25:00,063 --> 00:25:02,172
My bladder is about 30
seconds from imploding.

461
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,174
Okay. We'll get you
to the bathroom...

462
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,958
together and carefully.

463
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,090
There you go.

464
00:25:07,114 --> 00:25:08,394
All right, all right, all right.

465
00:25:08,418 --> 00:25:10,572
We're going, we're going.

466
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,676
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.
- There we go.

467
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,488
Okay.

468
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,969
So you a fan of
Thai food or what?

469
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:19,232
- I love Thai food.
- Yeah?

470
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,176
I never get to have it
'cause Brooke's not a fan.

471
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,627
- Oh.
- Are we getting Thai food?

472
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:24,890
- Yeah. Absolutely. We're gonna order it.
- Awesome.

473
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:26,457
Must be your lucky night.

474
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,178
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay, we got it.

475
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:31,767
- Okay.
- Okay. Hold on.

476
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:33,638
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm going as fast as I can.

477
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,205
- I know, I know, I know.
- All right.

478
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:36,598
Okay. I think I
got it from here.

479
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,990
- Oh!
- Okay.

480
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,601
All right, let's
do this together.

481
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,993
- Nice and easy...
- All right.

482
00:25:41,017 --> 00:25:42,560
Okay.

483
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:45,084
Slowly, slowly.
Just slowly there.

484
00:25:45,108 --> 00:25:46,303
All right.

485
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,763
- Okay.
- Okay. Go ahead.

486
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:55,051
Lance, this is what
I do for a living.

487
00:25:55,075 --> 00:25:56,635
Go ahead. It's all
very technical to me.

488
00:26:17,097 --> 00:26:18,272
Okay.

489
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,797
There you go.

490
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:27,586
Fire away.

491
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:30,763
Stage fright.

492
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:35,855
I'll plug my ears.

493
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:58,593
Yeah, my family are
crazy about basketball.

494
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,977
When I was a kid, my dad had
season tickets to the Clippers.

495
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,892
And it didn't matter if
they were down by 20

496
00:27:02,916 --> 00:27:05,425
in the last five minutes,
we had to stay to the end.

497
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,297
Um, my uncle had
season tickets, too.

498
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:08,559
- No.
- Yeah.

499
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,780
We were there every
game to the bitter end.

500
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,477
Oh, so that was you
seated across from us.

501
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:14,633
Yeah, that was us!

502
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:17,960
Ooh.

503
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,614
Are you okay?

504
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,572
Yeah. I just started
to feel light-headed.

505
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,052
Okay.

506
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:24,730
Let's get you moving
around a bit.

507
00:27:26,557 --> 00:27:27,733
Ooh.

508
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:38,415
Better?

509
00:27:38,439 --> 00:27:40,049
Yeah.

510
00:27:41,964 --> 00:27:43,226
Yeah. A lot.

511
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:45,575
Thanks, Chloe.

512
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,731
I really, really appreciate it.

513
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:51,384
It's my job.

514
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:52,845
A very admirable one at that.

515
00:27:54,368 --> 00:27:55,737
Unlike mine.

516
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,347
What do you do?

517
00:27:57,371 --> 00:27:58,740
I'm a web designer.

518
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,959
That's a great job!

519
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,961
Come on, everybody
needs a website.

520
00:28:02,985 --> 00:28:04,354
Yeah.

521
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:05,938
Oh, you know what?
This could be Brooke.

522
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,513
Brooke?

523
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:12,907
No.

524
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,191
You okay?

525
00:28:15,215 --> 00:28:17,454
Yeah.

526
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:19,045
That wasn't too convincing.

527
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,765
Relationship issues.

528
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:26,313
Mm. Those are fun.

529
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:28,924
Yeah...

530
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,603
Just tell me they stop
once you get married.

531
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,323
I wouldn't know.

532
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,129
Brooke and I aren't married.

533
00:28:40,153 --> 00:28:42,305
- Get outta here.
- Yeah.

534
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,915
Well, not yet at least.

535
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:46,483
I asked her a year ago, but...

536
00:28:46,507 --> 00:28:48,067
she has this theory
that we need to wait

537
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:49,616
until the three year mark.

538
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,792
Really?

539
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,271
Yeah.

540
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:54,602
At first I was bitter
about it, but...

541
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,085
You know, after a while, I
started to understand it.

542
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:03,698
Now, this texting guy.

543
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:05,873
Is he the one for you?

544
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:10,792
I don't know.

545
00:29:14,143 --> 00:29:15,686
Sorry, I just...

546
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:18,321
I always envisioned the guy
that I ended up with...

547
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,368
treating me like a princess.

548
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,477
And this one, not so much.

549
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:26,765
Then dump him.

550
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:29,874
Seriously.

551
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,658
Why shouldn't you be
treated like a princess?

552
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:35,556
You deserve that, don't you?

553
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,039
Why settle?

554
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,855
I appreciate you staying
a little longer.

555
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,682
Oh, come on. It's my pleasure.

556
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,946
You know, Lance is one of
the more civilized patients

557
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,774
I've had in a long time.

558
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,776
Here. I packed you a
little something.

559
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,844
Oh...

560
00:30:04,454 --> 00:30:06,041
Uh, we ordered in
Thai food tonight.

561
00:30:06,065 --> 00:30:07,825
- I'm full.
- Great!

562
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,654
I'm so relieved he finally has
someone to enjoy Thai with.

563
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:12,395
Cool.

564
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,659
Just for future knowledge, are
you allergic to any foods?

565
00:30:14,683 --> 00:30:15,528
No.

566
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,921
Okay. So you're not vegan

567
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:19,010
or you don't have an
allergy to pasta?

568
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:20,707
No, I love pasta.

569
00:30:20,731 --> 00:30:22,884
Which by the way, thank
you again for last night.

570
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:24,363
The pasta was delicious.

571
00:30:24,387 --> 00:30:26,931
Sure. My pleasure.

572
00:30:26,955 --> 00:30:28,846
Okay. Well, you
have a good night.

573
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,263
Bye, Lance.

574
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,290
I don't know what to say, love.

575
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:41,467
Maybe she has an
aversion to Italian food

576
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:43,165
and she didn't want to tell you.

577
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:44,862
Why wouldn't she
want to tell me?

578
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,733
Who knows?

579
00:30:46,757 --> 00:30:48,605
Maybe because you're a sous chef

580
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:50,433
at an authentic
Italian restaurant

581
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:52,783
and she didn't want
to offend you.

582
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,219
It's just odd.

583
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:56,047
It's like she wanted me
to see it, you know...

584
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,204
putting it in our trash can.

585
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:04,863
Nice.

586
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,900
There's my lady.

587
00:31:44,293 --> 00:31:45,792
I'm going to bed.

588
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:47,838
Hey, hey, hey.

589
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,318
Hey!

590
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:51,494
Is that how you treat
the man you're with?

591
00:31:51,518 --> 00:31:53,235
How 'bout a proper hello?

592
00:31:53,259 --> 00:31:55,454
Just get off me, okay?

593
00:31:55,478 --> 00:31:56,891
What?

594
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,440
Baby, I'm just trying
to spread the love.

595
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,126
- Hey.
- Hi.

596
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,736
- Thanks for coming,
- Oh, of course.

597
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,327
Come on in.

598
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,134
His name was Darren Wells.

599
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:24,788
Mid 40s. He drove
a delivery truck.

600
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,355
He was off that night.

601
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:28,923
The toxicology lab reported
that he had a very high

602
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,387
amount of alcohol
in his bloodstream.

603
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:32,404
Apparently he was a
recovering addict

604
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:34,276
who had taken to heavy drinking.

605
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,887
I spoke with a DA, who
is a personal friend,

606
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:39,107
and I think that this is
just one of those cases

607
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,022
that tends to go away.

608
00:32:41,046 --> 00:32:44,242
But... I mean, that poor man.

609
00:32:44,266 --> 00:32:46,984
We just feel so bad
about what happened.

610
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,943
Did he have a family?

611
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,336
Well, since both of his
parents are deceased,

612
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,818
I really don't foresee a lawsuit
or anything of that nature.

613
00:32:54,842 --> 00:32:56,733
Well, was he married
or did he have kids?

614
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,561
Nope. Just a brother
in Wisconsin.

615
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:00,563
But I believe that
if a suit was filed,

616
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:03,107
we would have already heard about
it from the county courthouse.

617
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:04,436
I don't know.

618
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,090
I feel like we should at least

619
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,788
reach out to his brother
and send our condolences.

620
00:33:08,812 --> 00:33:10,573
That is very sweet
of you, Brooke,

621
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:12,270
but I don't recommend it.

622
00:33:12,294 --> 00:33:14,664
In these cases, it's
best to just lay low

623
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:17,101
and let him grieve his loss
because the bottom line is,

624
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:18,929
the two of you were
victims in the situation

625
00:33:18,953 --> 00:33:20,781
just as much as he was.

626
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,642
This is top five for sure.

627
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,905
- For reals?
- For reals.

628
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:41,929
Yes! Because I'm going to feature it at
the restaurant fundraiser on Friday.

629
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,085
Well seriously, hon,
it's phenomenal.

630
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,043
I'm already thinking
about seconds.

631
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,045
Well somebody sure has
his appetite back.

632
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:49,916
I know.

633
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:52,963
I'm feeling more like myself
these past couple of days.

634
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:54,791
I guess Chloe's doing
something right.

635
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:56,010
Seriously, hon.

636
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,114
She knows what she's doing.

637
00:33:57,138 --> 00:33:58,708
She uses this traditional.

638
00:33:58,732 --> 00:34:02,103
Nepalese medical philosophy
with these pressure points

639
00:34:02,127 --> 00:34:04,670
and herbal medicine...

640
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,846
- The pain has been cut in half.
- Oh, my god.

641
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,197
That's great, sweetie.

642
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,938
And here I am being so selfish

643
00:34:11,962 --> 00:34:14,985
and complaining about her when
she's helping you get healthy.

644
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,639
I'm awful.

645
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:18,099
Yes, you are.

646
00:34:19,361 --> 00:34:20,884
Seconds, please.

647
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:26,910
- All right.
- More... more...

648
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,196
- Okay.
- Uh-huh. There we go.

649
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:52,501
Oh!

650
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:54,165
So sorry I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

651
00:34:54,189 --> 00:34:56,157
No, no. I'm just a big baby.

652
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,767
No.

653
00:34:57,791 --> 00:34:59,160
You look pretty.

654
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,553
Thanks.

655
00:35:01,577 --> 00:35:03,947
They were just giving
away free makeup samples

656
00:35:03,971 --> 00:35:06,297
at Bloomingdale's, so
I thought, "Why not?"

657
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:08,865
I love makeup samples.

658
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:11,737
Yeah. I wish they were giving away
free samples of your perfume.

659
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:13,261
I love that.

660
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,305
Oh, thank you.

661
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,959
It's Lance's favorite.

662
00:35:15,983 --> 00:35:17,917
It's called Forbidden Romance.

663
00:35:17,941 --> 00:35:20,141
It's actually one of the more
affordable ones out there.

664
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,576
Uh, Chloe, I just wanted to
say how much I appreciate

665
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,491
everything that you're
doing for Lance.

666
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:29,103
It's my pleasure.

667
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,017
Not to mention, my job, which...

668
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:32,321
I should get back to our patient

669
00:35:32,345 --> 00:35:34,151
'cause Lord knows he's
gonna need help again

670
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:35,568
aiming for that toilet.

671
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:10,013
Okay.

672
00:36:10,037 --> 00:36:13,040
Your meal of
champions is served.

673
00:36:14,694 --> 00:36:15,845
Ta-da!

674
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:17,238
A very colorful display.

675
00:36:17,262 --> 00:36:19,065
It's no Brooke, but I'm shooting

676
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:20,719
to be better than the hospital.

677
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,765
You're really reaching
for that gold standard.

678
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,420
All right, let's
get you situated.

679
00:36:25,444 --> 00:36:27,770
I recognize that fragrance.

680
00:36:27,794 --> 00:36:29,467
Do you like it?

681
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,686
It's a favorite of Brooke's.

682
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,166
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

683
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,645
Hm.

684
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,995
So it's pins and
needles in my leg.

685
00:36:36,019 --> 00:36:37,040
Okay. Lower or upper?

686
00:36:37,064 --> 00:36:38,239
Lower.

687
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,375
Okay...

688
00:36:49,381 --> 00:36:51,141
Um... I'm good.

689
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,317
You... you nailed it.
I feel great.

690
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:55,061
- Okay.
- Could you pass me my iPad, please?

691
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,626
Not before you eat your soup.

692
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,690
Oh, it's okay. I'm not really
that hungry right now.

693
00:36:59,714 --> 00:37:01,543
You've got to stick to
the program, Mister.

694
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:03,525
And I slaved in the
kitchen all day!

695
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:06,156
All right.

696
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,225
Yes, ma'am.

697
00:37:11,011 --> 00:37:12,597
So?

698
00:37:12,621 --> 00:37:14,295
It's delicious.

699
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,277
Simple, yet so robust.

700
00:37:18,845 --> 00:37:19,889
Oh.

701
00:37:21,195 --> 00:37:22,477
Okay, let's...

702
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,174
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

703
00:37:24,198 --> 00:37:25,523
Here...

704
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:26,707
Yeah, let's just take it off.

705
00:37:26,731 --> 00:37:27,906
Okay.

706
00:37:33,642 --> 00:37:34,793
Um...

707
00:37:34,817 --> 00:37:36,230
I'm gonna get you a clean shirt.

708
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,255
- Okay.
- Yeah.

709
00:37:59,755 --> 00:38:03,455
I picked the blue one 'cause I
like this color best on you.

710
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,153
All right...

711
00:38:07,546 --> 00:38:08,764
Arms up.

712
00:38:11,071 --> 00:38:12,246
Perfect.

713
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:15,902
Oh, you got somethin'.

714
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,276
Uh yeah, you know what?

715
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,911
It's... it's not budging.

716
00:38:27,914 --> 00:38:28,915
Got it.

717
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:32,658
Ah!

718
00:38:38,446 --> 00:38:40,381
That prick from the
Times is here!

719
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:42,078
Hasn't reviewed me
in over twyears!

720
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:43,582
- Harrison Duben?
- No. The other one.

721
00:38:43,606 --> 00:38:45,951
- Sherridan Tishman?
- No. The other one.

722
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,692
The only other one
is Gena Slutzky.

723
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,346
That prick.

724
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,521
She almost ruined my career.

725
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:52,218
Okay.

726
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:55,483
I need something...
magic from you tonight.

727
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:56,484
Can I count on you?

728
00:38:56,508 --> 00:38:58,007
Of course.

729
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,400
That's my girl.

730
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,924
Whose got table 49?

731
00:39:01,948 --> 00:39:03,428
I need his plated in five!

732
00:39:20,053 --> 00:39:22,248
- Hey.
- Hi.

733
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:23,815
Is Brooke here?

734
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,406
She had to work late again.

735
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:31,194
Does it bother you that your
relationship is so one-sided?

736
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:33,806
It's not one-sided.

737
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,114
I think you deserve better.

738
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:45,557
Like, a wise and incredibly handsome
man wouldn't simply settle.

739
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:50,146
I took your advice, by the way.

740
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,930
I dumped James.

741
00:39:51,954 --> 00:39:54,585
He was gone first
thing in the morning.

742
00:39:54,609 --> 00:39:56,959
Yeah well, I'm not settling.

743
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,833
Brooke is everything
I ever wanted.

744
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:04,750
I'm a very lucky man.

745
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:08,860
Really?

746
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:10,277
Yes.

747
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,736
She turned down your
marriage proposal.

748
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,718
She's never around
when you need her.

749
00:40:19,373 --> 00:40:21,419
Actions speak louder than words.

750
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,358
Chloe, enough!

751
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:30,186
What? Stop.

752
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:32,971
Okay, you need to get
your things and leave!

753
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:34,997
Lance, I'm sorry. I didn't...

754
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:37,759
I mean...

755
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:39,674
I was getting mixed messages.

756
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:41,351
Excuse me?

757
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:45,549
Okay, it was my fault.
Completely my fault.

758
00:40:45,573 --> 00:40:47,227
I crossed lines. I don't...

759
00:40:48,663 --> 00:40:52,406
Just kind of... am going
through a lot right now.

760
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,304
Don't fire me.

761
00:41:01,328 --> 00:41:03,175
Please.

762
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:05,027
Chloe, this is all
just so bizarre.

763
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:09,094
I mean, I don't see any way
that we can keep you on.

764
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:11,096
I screwed up, okay?

765
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,489
I screwed up.

766
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:15,187
It is not gonna happen again.
I promise you.

767
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:17,668
All right, I'm gonna be completely
professional from now on.

768
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,085
Okay?

769
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,325
Please.

770
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:24,177
Lance, please.

771
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:29,332
All right, let's just call it
a day and sleep on it, okay?

772
00:41:29,356 --> 00:41:30,705
Okay.

773
00:41:32,185 --> 00:41:33,945
Um...

774
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:35,686
I'm just gonna finish
the laundry...

775
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,122
No. No need. It's fine.

776
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:40,648
Just go home and get some rest.

777
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:42,737
- Are... are you okay by yourself?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

778
00:41:42,761 --> 00:41:44,441
I'm just exhausted and
going back to sleep.

779
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,072
I'm just gonna let
myself out then.

780
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,642
Thank you...

781
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,079
Lance.

782
00:41:59,168 --> 00:42:00,343
Sure.

783
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,780
Okay.

784
00:42:33,681 --> 00:42:35,441
Whoa.

785
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,574
Somebody's a little jumpy.

786
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:39,426
Sweetheart.

787
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:42,536
Thank God it's you.

788
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,562
Who else would it be?

789
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,063
Just had a nightmare.

790
00:42:48,087 --> 00:42:49,630
You know, people
coming after me.

791
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:51,893
Oh, poor baby.

792
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:53,919
Do you want me to
make it better?

793
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:08,997
I missed you.

794
00:43:09,021 --> 00:43:10,457
I missed you, too.

795
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,610
How was work?

796
00:43:13,634 --> 00:43:16,874
Stressful and amazing
all at the same time.

797
00:43:16,898 --> 00:43:18,683
We had the Times reviewer there.

798
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:21,662
Anyway, I'll tell
you all about it,

799
00:43:21,686 --> 00:43:23,601
but first, I must shower.

800
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:27,126
How was everything here today?

801
00:43:28,954 --> 00:43:30,322
Great.

802
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:33,064
You know, just...
same old, same old.

803
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:34,631
Great.

804
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:35,961
Be back in a flash.

805
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:36,998
Geeze!

806
00:44:37,022 --> 00:44:38,173
I didn't hear you come in.

807
00:44:38,197 --> 00:44:40,329
You shouldn't be moving
around without me.

808
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,442
Actually, I feel good.

809
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:48,749
Good enough that I can wheel
this thing on my own.

810
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:51,969
Well, I am your nurse and
you need to do as I advise.

811
00:44:51,993 --> 00:44:56,408
And right now, I advise you
to get back onto the couch.

812
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:58,106
Okay.

813
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:00,262
All right. Carefully...

814
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:08,357
Great.

815
00:45:10,751 --> 00:45:12,773
So I'm gonna go
back in the kitchen

816
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:14,426
and make you your first meal.

817
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,650
Not to mention, you are way
overdue for your medication.

818
00:45:38,997 --> 00:45:40,957
If you need anything else,
I'll be in the kitchen.

819
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:45,090
Hey, Chloe?

820
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,678
Look...

821
00:45:48,702 --> 00:45:50,767
I want you to know
that I'm sorry...

822
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,488
if I was at all a
bit harsh with you.

823
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:56,754
I appreciate
everything you said.

824
00:45:59,321 --> 00:46:01,560
And I'm more than
willing to keep you on.

825
00:46:01,584 --> 00:46:03,195
Can I go into the kitchen now?

826
00:46:04,892 --> 00:46:06,522
Uh...

827
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:07,915
okay.

828
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:08,983
Sure.

829
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,322
Ugh. Typical Monday.
Eight reservations.

830
00:46:24,346 --> 00:46:25,976
Hey, Marco's not here tonight.

831
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,022
Why don't you go home and
make dinner for your man?

832
00:46:28,046 --> 00:46:30,111
- Really?
- Yeah. I can cover around here.

833
00:46:30,135 --> 00:46:31,852
All right.

834
00:46:31,876 --> 00:46:32,964
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

835
00:46:49,894 --> 00:46:51,156
Honey?

836
00:46:52,722 --> 00:46:53,723
Lance?

837
00:46:56,726 --> 00:46:58,095
Lance?

838
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,947
Lance!

839
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:03,057
Lance, wake up!

840
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:04,058
Wake up!

841
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:05,015
Chloe!

842
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,562
Call 911!

843
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:10,412
Baby? Baby?

844
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:11,436
God.

845
00:47:21,621 --> 00:47:24,295
And you have no idea how
long he was like that for?

846
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,906
I mean, what were you doing?

847
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,733
I was just doing laundry.

848
00:47:27,757 --> 00:47:29,561
I was in the other room. I'm...

849
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:31,781
I know this is my fault.

850
00:47:31,805 --> 00:47:34,547
It's just that I have no idea
what could have happened to him.

851
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,963
Bad reactions to drugs
happen all the time,

852
00:47:39,987 --> 00:47:41,660
so maybe the oxy
was just too much

853
00:47:41,684 --> 00:47:43,097
with his slight arrhythmia.

854
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:44,707
Ms. Harmon?

855
00:47:44,731 --> 00:47:46,491
I'm sorry, we're just gonna have Ms.
Harmon

856
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:48,450
come back right now.
You can follow me.

857
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:51,583
I'm his nurse, so I should be fine
to go in and I'd like to see him.

858
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:53,368
I understand, but I
have doctors' orders.

859
00:47:53,392 --> 00:47:54,717
No one else is gonna
be let in tonight.

860
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:56,545
You should really go
home and get some rest.

861
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:58,025
We'll take good care of him.
Come on.

862
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:59,877
Could you call or
text me, please?

863
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:10,080
Do you have any
idea what happened?

864
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,517
How much oxycodone he took
in the last 24 hours?

865
00:48:12,541 --> 00:48:14,693
I don't know. The
amount he always takes.

866
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:16,043
The amount he was prescribed.

867
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:17,740
The tox report says otherwise.

868
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:20,045
A normal dose couldn't have
caused what happened to Lance.

869
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,310
Wait a second.

870
00:48:22,334 --> 00:48:24,834
Are you telling me that
Lance was poisoned?

871
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:26,705
What I'm telling you is
that he's very lucky

872
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:28,577
you showed up when you did.

873
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:32,537
Look, the average person takes between
12 and 20 breaths per minute.

874
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:33,841
When they wheeled Lance in here,

875
00:48:33,865 --> 00:48:36,019
his BPM was well below ten.

876
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:37,934
He was on his way
to cardiac arrest.

877
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,850
What I'd like to know is where his
nurse was during all of this.

878
00:48:40,874 --> 00:48:43,984
She was doing laundry
in the other room.

879
00:48:44,008 --> 00:48:46,725
Are you sure this
wasn't an accident?

880
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:48,684
I just don't see how.

881
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:51,034
Oh, my god.

882
00:48:51,058 --> 00:48:54,342
Listen, his doctor will be in
to speak with you shortly.

883
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:55,933
You can go in.

884
00:49:04,028 --> 00:49:05,309
Lance?

885
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:08,510
Hey. Hey, babe.

886
00:49:14,386 --> 00:49:16,127
This is like my second home.

887
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:20,150
How are you feeling?

888
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,959
Loopy.

889
00:49:23,482 --> 00:49:24,874
What happened?

890
00:49:26,485 --> 00:49:29,029
You OD'd on your drugs.

891
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,726
What?

892
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,120
Did Chloe give you any extra?

893
00:49:33,144 --> 00:49:35,035
Or did you take any extra?

894
00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:36,993
No.

895
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:38,017
No.

896
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,674
Well, do you remember anything?

897
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:45,436
Not much.

898
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,134
Just...

899
00:49:47,158 --> 00:49:49,005
I was trying to get some
work done on the couch

900
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:52,443
and then I started to
feel groggy, and...

901
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,880
I turned on the TV and then...

902
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:56,819
and then I wake up here.

903
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:00,190
Is it still Monday?

904
00:50:00,214 --> 00:50:01,607
It's Tuesday.

905
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,393
Listen...

906
00:50:06,742 --> 00:50:08,851
Barb thinks that Chloe did it.

907
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:10,616
What?

908
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:16,380
I... is that what
the doctor said?

909
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:17,971
That I was
purposefully poisoned?

910
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:21,279
It looks that way. Yeah.

911
00:50:27,111 --> 00:50:28,329
Brooke...

912
00:50:30,853 --> 00:50:33,006
I haven't been totally
honest with you.

913
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,747
Things haven't been going
as smoothly with Chloe

914
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:36,771
as I lead you to believe.

915
00:50:39,732 --> 00:50:42,711
She made a pass at me.
She tried to kiss me

916
00:50:42,735 --> 00:50:44,800
and I... I pushed her
away and I sent her home.

917
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:46,410
Why didn't you tell me?

918
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:48,151
Because I felt bad.

919
00:50:48,175 --> 00:50:52,764
She seemed like she was about
to fall off the deep end and...

920
00:50:52,788 --> 00:50:55,289
And I knew that if I told you,
you would freak out about it.

921
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:57,726
That's not the kind of thing
you keep from me, Lance.

922
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,336
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

923
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,622
I made a mistake.

924
00:51:03,277 --> 00:51:06,117
But you know, we just, we were just
talking about her guy problem and...

925
00:51:07,281 --> 00:51:09,562
I told her that she could do
better and she must have been

926
00:51:09,586 --> 00:51:12,175
crazy enough to think
that I meant myself.

927
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:14,699
You're not supposed to
be her friend, Lance.

928
00:51:14,723 --> 00:51:16,788
She's your nurse.

929
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:18,412
You can't even pee
without help from her.

930
00:51:18,436 --> 00:51:20,183
I mean, what were you thinking?

931
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:22,055
You probably weren't thinking.

932
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,493
You were probably just playing
your cutesy, handsome, charming,

933
00:51:25,517 --> 00:51:27,408
absent-minded
professor as usual.

934
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:28,887
Brooke, that's not fair.

935
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:31,064
I didn't want to cause
more problems in the event

936
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,936
that it was just some silly,
conjured, isolated incident.

937
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,025
Yeah. A silly, isolated incident

938
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:38,593
incident that almost got
you killed... again.

939
00:51:38,617 --> 00:51:39,724
Brooke!

940
00:51:39,748 --> 00:51:41,030
Where are you going?

941
00:51:41,054 --> 00:51:42,403
To call the cops.

942
00:51:46,059 --> 00:51:49,367
Detective Thames, we need you to
come to the hospital right away.

943
00:51:51,543 --> 00:51:53,303
Well, how are we doing, Mr.
Boston?

944
00:51:53,327 --> 00:51:55,088
Okay, I guess.

945
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,655
I've seen better days.

946
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,223
So listen, your girlfriend
told me that you overdosed

947
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:01,920
on this medication
you've been on

948
00:52:01,944 --> 00:52:04,227
and that made me very concerned
about this nurse of yours.

949
00:52:04,251 --> 00:52:06,011
Chloe Spade?

950
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:08,753
I don't know if either
of you know this,

951
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:10,842
but Ms. Spade is
manic depressive.

952
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,802
Well, we knew she was on
medication, so we kind of figured.

953
00:52:13,826 --> 00:52:15,586
Yeah. Well, this
isn't the first time

954
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,250
she's had issues with
one of her patients.

955
00:52:17,274 --> 00:52:18,850
Oh, so she tried to
kill someone else?

956
00:52:18,874 --> 00:52:20,354
No, no. But...

957
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:25,074
Well, this previous patient
a few years back, um,

958
00:52:25,098 --> 00:52:27,163
he was a successful
actor in Brentwood,

959
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:29,339
injured himself on set,
couldn't walk, and...

960
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:32,105
they became involved.

961
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:35,867
When Ms. Spade found out
that he was married,

962
00:52:35,891 --> 00:52:38,329
his wife was in Canada working
on another film, um...

963
00:52:40,287 --> 00:52:41,830
she went crazy.

964
00:52:41,854 --> 00:52:45,268
Uh... destroyed the house,
left the guy helpless

965
00:52:45,292 --> 00:52:47,468
and immobile without
food or a phone.

966
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:51,361
- But she didn't try to murder him?
- Well, technically.

967
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:53,537
But it's negligence
all the same.

968
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:55,601
I mean, it was just virtue
of the fact that they guy

969
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:58,586
decided to drop the charges she
hooked on with another contractor.

970
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:00,762
But you know, given her history,

971
00:53:00,786 --> 00:53:03,504
her dad's abuse, her illness,

972
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:06,463
the drug cocktails
she's taken...

973
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:07,943
it's bad.

974
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,858
Well, how is she even
able to nurse still?

975
00:53:09,882 --> 00:53:12,382
I... I don't know.
We're working on that.

976
00:53:12,406 --> 00:53:14,887
Okay, and how can we be sure
that she wanted to kill me?

977
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,083
I mean, she's a nurse, right?

978
00:53:18,107 --> 00:53:19,955
She knows what it takes
to kill somebody,

979
00:53:19,979 --> 00:53:21,913
so if she wanted me
dead, I'd be dead.

980
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:24,089
So...

981
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:26,788
maybe she wanted to be heard?

982
00:53:26,812 --> 00:53:28,790
Or... maybe she was just pissed?

983
00:53:28,814 --> 00:53:31,271
It doesn't change
what she did, Lance.

984
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:32,881
I mean, you could have died!

985
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:35,231
She shouldn't be anyone's
nurse if she's crazy!

986
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:38,582
You're right... but I'm not sure

987
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:41,281
I want to press charges either.

988
00:53:41,305 --> 00:53:44,022
I mean... Chloe needs
to be in a hospital,

989
00:53:44,046 --> 00:53:45,415
not in some jail cell.

990
00:53:45,439 --> 00:53:47,635
Look, the doctor would
probably suggest rehab,

991
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:49,680
but I doubt very much that Ms.
Spade would admit to anything.

992
00:53:49,704 --> 00:53:51,291
And in the way that she
administered your drugs,

993
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:53,031
the doctor wasn't even
sure of her intent.

994
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:55,033
So it's time for you
to get another nurse.

995
00:53:55,057 --> 00:53:56,777
In the meantime, I'm
going to look into this

996
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:58,841
a little bit further, and
if you hear anything else,

997
00:53:58,865 --> 00:54:00,300
you guys call me right away.

998
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:03,172
- And get out of this bed.
- Thanks, Detective.

999
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:04,596
- Thank you.
- All right. Take care.

1000
00:54:15,817 --> 00:54:17,317
Oh, Brooke!

1001
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:18,907
How is he? How's Lance?

1002
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:25,194
You don't have to worry.

1003
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:26,717
We decided not to press charges.

1004
00:54:26,741 --> 00:54:28,197
Press charges?

1005
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:29,503
For what?

1006
00:54:29,527 --> 00:54:31,093
Don't make this
harder than it is.

1007
00:54:32,791 --> 00:54:34,334
The oxy.

1008
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:36,534
We know you tried to OD him.

1009
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:40,035
No! What?

1010
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:41,979
I gave him the same amount
I've always given him.

1011
00:54:42,003 --> 00:54:43,283
The amount that he's prescribed.

1012
00:54:43,307 --> 00:54:44,801
It's in his report, Chloe.

1013
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:47,956
Brooke, I didn't do this.

1014
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,025
Is this like that
actor in Brentwood?

1015
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:53,115
Oh, my...

1016
00:54:55,379 --> 00:54:59,272
That... I was not
in my right mind.

1017
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,969
Are you ever in your right mind?

1018
00:55:00,993 --> 00:55:02,953
Or are you just utterly and
completely delusional?

1019
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:06,496
Our attorney has
called your contractor

1020
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,080
and let them know that
we will no longer

1021
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:09,282
be needing your services.

1022
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,370
You're fired.

1023
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:12,459
No. No, no. Don't do this.

1024
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:14,591
No, no. I... I didn't
do anything wrong.

1025
00:55:14,615 --> 00:55:16,550
Between making passes
at my boyfriend

1026
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:18,094
and then almost killing
him with drugs,

1027
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:19,422
I disagree.

1028
00:55:19,446 --> 00:55:22,797
This... this can't
be happening again.

1029
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:28,605
Chloe look, I should hate you

1030
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:30,781
for what you did, but I don't.

1031
00:55:30,805 --> 00:55:33,567
I know you haven't
had an easy life,

1032
00:55:33,591 --> 00:55:35,786
but you need to seek
professional help.

1033
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:38,485
The staff here is
willing to help you.

1034
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:41,401
No. I am not going
to rehab again.

1035
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,489
Fine.

1036
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:45,318
But you're not fit to nurse.

1037
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:47,581
Okay.

1038
00:55:47,605 --> 00:55:51,193
Let me just... let me
just go see Lance, okay?

1039
00:55:51,217 --> 00:55:52,657
Let me just tell him goodbye.
Please?

1040
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:54,030
Absolutely not.

1041
00:55:57,223 --> 00:55:58,442
Fine.

1042
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:09,385
You know, if you guys were
so perfect for each other,

1043
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:11,019
why haven't you married him yet?

1044
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,956
It's people like you, Brooke,

1045
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,479
who have the world
handed to them

1046
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:18,829
on a silver platter,
taking every single thing

1047
00:56:18,853 --> 00:56:21,595
for granted, who
deserve nothing.

1048
00:56:30,038 --> 00:56:32,669
This is Lance. Leave a
message at the [beep]

1049
00:56:32,693 --> 00:56:34,541
Lance, hi. It's Chloe.

1050
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:37,326
Listen, um, can you just call me
as soon as you get this, please?

1051
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:39,510
You have to know I would never
do anything to hurt you.

1052
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,139
I love you, okay?

1053
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:49,841
I know you're with Brooke, but please,
I just need you to call me, okay?

1054
00:57:21,002 --> 00:57:22,351
What do you want?

1055
00:57:24,353 --> 00:57:26,225
Chloe, I know it's you.

1056
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:46,221
Wow, she really wants
to talk to you.

1057
00:57:46,245 --> 00:57:47,918
I guess you guys really bonded.

1058
00:57:47,942 --> 00:57:50,443
What, between the Thai food and
her helping you urinate...

1059
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,748
Come on, Brooke.

1060
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:52,923
You know nothing happened.

1061
00:57:52,947 --> 00:57:54,035
Do I?

1062
00:57:56,037 --> 00:57:58,276
I thought we trusted each other.

1063
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,780
So did I.

1064
00:58:02,174 --> 00:58:03,630
Now where are you going?

1065
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:05,153
If we're gonna get stuck
here another night,

1066
00:58:05,177 --> 00:58:06,850
then I need to go home
and take a shower

1067
00:58:06,874 --> 00:58:08,074
and get us some fresh clothes.

1068
00:58:08,098 --> 00:58:09,549
Brooke!

1069
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,488
Don't leave like this.

1070
00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:16,991
Get some rest.

1071
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:18,190
I'll be back later.

1072
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:08,711
Chloe!

1073
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:10,191
You better get out of here!

1074
01:00:10,215 --> 01:00:11,782
I'm two seconds from
calling the police!

1075
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,611
Do you know if she
was admitted yet?

1076
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,091
Excuse me, I have a
delivery for Lance Boston.

1077
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:42,440
Do you know which room he's in?

1078
01:00:42,464 --> 01:00:44,007
Thanks. You can
just leave it here.

1079
01:00:44,031 --> 01:00:46,096
We'll make sure he gets it.

1080
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:48,760
Oh. I promised the courier that I
would deliver it to him directly.

1081
01:00:48,784 --> 01:00:50,090
What floor do you work on?

1082
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:53,060
First floor check-in.

1083
01:00:53,084 --> 01:00:54,884
I didn't know we had any
new hires down there.

1084
01:00:54,908 --> 01:00:56,127
What's your name, Miss?

1085
01:00:59,351 --> 01:01:01,658
Just make sure Lance
Boston gets these, please.

1086
01:01:07,446 --> 01:01:09,206
I want to throw up.

1087
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:11,295
I'm so sorry.

1088
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:12,775
It's not your fault, Barb.

1089
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,124
The hospital needs to figure out

1090
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:15,668
a better system to
screen these people.

1091
01:01:15,692 --> 01:01:17,475
I agree.

1092
01:01:17,499 --> 01:01:21,001
Listen, I have a bunch of
vacation days stockpiled.

1093
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:22,567
I'll take care of Lance.

1094
01:01:22,591 --> 01:01:24,047
Oh, that's so sweet.

1095
01:01:24,071 --> 01:01:25,875
But we couldn't ask
you to do that, Barb.

1096
01:01:25,899 --> 01:01:27,268
I'm not asking.

1097
01:01:27,292 --> 01:01:29,009
I'm telling.

1098
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:30,687
Can't argue with that, babe.

1099
01:01:39,957 --> 01:01:41,369
Thanks a lot.

1100
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:43,588
All right, you ready
to get out of here

1101
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:45,808
once and for all?

1102
01:01:45,832 --> 01:01:48,752
Aw, but I was finally getting used to
the bedspring prodding my sphincter.

1103
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:49,682
Hi!

1104
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,866
Getting out on good behavior?

1105
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,685
Yeah.

1106
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,109
The doctor says he thinks he'd
be better off resting at home.

1107
01:01:55,133 --> 01:01:57,907
I'm just a little bit concerned
about Chloe making an appearance.

1108
01:01:57,931 --> 01:02:00,910
Well, the good news is besides
filing the restraining order,

1109
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:03,054
I also put in a call in to
her staffing administration

1110
01:02:03,078 --> 01:02:05,360
to make sure that she does
not do this to anyone again.

1111
01:02:05,384 --> 01:02:06,699
Amen.

1112
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,443
You did change the locks
in your house, yes?

1113
01:02:08,467 --> 01:02:09,832
- Of course.
- Good.

1114
01:02:09,856 --> 01:02:12,096
Now, I don't want you guys to
worry about anything, okay?

1115
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,445
But just do not
encourage her behavior.

1116
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:16,360
Don't answer her phone
calls, her text messages,

1117
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:17,448
her e-mails... Nothing.

1118
01:02:17,472 --> 01:02:19,886
And she's gonna go away, okay?

1119
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:22,870
All right, I have another client here
to see, but you guys take care, okay?

1120
01:02:22,894 --> 01:02:25,026
You, too. Thanks, Gwen.

1121
01:02:30,268 --> 01:02:32,072
No. Monday is a no-go.

1122
01:02:32,096 --> 01:02:33,726
No. I have lunch with
Brilstein at noon,

1123
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,249
and then I'm going dress
shopping with my sister after.

1124
01:02:35,273 --> 01:02:36,903
I'm not gonna cancel
on her again.

1125
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:37,991
Okay.

1126
01:02:38,015 --> 01:02:39,688
Okay. Yes.

1127
01:02:39,712 --> 01:02:41,232
I have a hot date
tonight with a bottle

1128
01:02:41,256 --> 01:02:42,952
of chardonnay in
my bed, goodnight.

1129
01:02:42,976 --> 01:02:44,562
You can't take my
job away from me.

1130
01:02:44,586 --> 01:02:46,782
Nursing is the
only thing I love.

1131
01:02:46,806 --> 01:02:48,784
Oh, well then you shouldn't
be so awful at it.

1132
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,046
I'm calling the police.

1133
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,158
What are you doing?

1134
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:13,113
Hello?

1135
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:14,679
Brooke, it's Connie.

1136
01:03:14,703 --> 01:03:16,507
Gwen's been attacked.
She's in the hospital.

1137
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:17,857
What?

1138
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,902
It's serious. She's
not waking up.

1139
01:03:19,926 --> 01:03:21,798
- Brooke, she's not waking up!
- Babe... babe.

1140
01:03:23,147 --> 01:03:24,496
Oh, my god.

1141
01:03:30,937 --> 01:03:32,852
You don't think it could've
been Chloe, do you?

1142
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,270
I don't know.

1143
01:03:40,294 --> 01:03:42,427
I mean, would Chloe
even know who Gwen is?

1144
01:03:44,168 --> 01:03:45,362
They never met.

1145
01:03:45,386 --> 01:03:46,973
I don't know.

1146
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:49,366
It just seems like a
weird coincidence.

1147
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,411
Yeah.

1148
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:53,414
Now she's in coma.

1149
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:54,958
I was thinking about
going to visit her

1150
01:03:54,982 --> 01:03:57,022
in the hospital after the
fundraiser tomorrow night.

1151
01:03:57,046 --> 01:03:58,331
You should.

1152
01:04:02,751 --> 01:04:04,642
I'm sorry.

1153
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:06,190
For what?

1154
01:04:07,713 --> 01:04:09,647
I haven't been the
best girlfriend.

1155
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:11,954
Brooke...

1156
01:04:11,978 --> 01:04:13,545
I'm always putting myself first.

1157
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:17,486
If there's anything good that's
come out of all of this,

1158
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:19,510
it's that I realize I could
never live without you.

1159
01:04:19,534 --> 01:04:20,528
Babe...

1160
01:04:20,552 --> 01:04:22,293
if anyone should apologize,
it should be me.

1161
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:25,644
I should've told you.

1162
01:04:27,646 --> 01:04:28,797
I don't know why I didn't.

1163
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:29,821
I just...

1164
01:04:31,824 --> 01:04:33,086
I'm sorry.

1165
01:04:41,312 --> 01:04:42,942
I'm sorry I said
I wanted to wait

1166
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:44,489
when you asked me to marry you.

1167
01:04:45,969 --> 01:04:47,947
I wanted to.

1168
01:04:47,971 --> 01:04:50,079
I guess I just thought that...

1169
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:52,192
we could wait until we
had more money or...

1170
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,954
more time.

1171
01:04:54,978 --> 01:04:57,086
I know.

1172
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:59,417
But we don't always
get more time, do we?

1173
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:03,136
I love you.

1174
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,683
I love you, too.

1175
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,212
All right. Eat up.

1176
01:05:21,047 --> 01:05:23,808
And I can't get in to see
him sooner than that, huh?

1177
01:05:23,832 --> 01:05:26,159
Because...

1178
01:05:26,183 --> 01:05:28,335
something is wrong
with my pills and...

1179
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:29,858
they're not working.

1180
01:05:29,882 --> 01:05:31,884
I need something
stronger, you know?

1181
01:05:33,668 --> 01:05:35,429
Next Monday.

1182
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:37,020
Okay. Great. Thanks.

1183
01:05:55,386 --> 01:05:57,930
Boy do I have a treat for you.

1184
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,888
Cookies?

1185
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:03,109
Rumor has it you
have a sweet tooth.

1186
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:05,154
Ms. Harmon tipped me off.

1187
01:06:05,178 --> 01:06:07,026
You know, she's not
much of a baker.

1188
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,766
She's much more into the savory,

1189
01:06:08,790 --> 01:06:11,315
which is probably good for me,
'cause if she was, I'd be fat.

1190
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:16,905
This was my mother's recipe.

1191
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:19,038
Even after she got
sick with Alzheimer's,

1192
01:06:19,062 --> 01:06:20,822
she didn't miss a
beat in the kitchen.

1193
01:06:20,846 --> 01:06:23,246
I think she believed that good
cooking was the best medicine.

1194
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:26,421
Well, it must have
been hard, though.

1195
01:06:27,896 --> 01:06:29,570
Yeah.

1196
01:06:29,594 --> 01:06:31,528
You know what they say...

1197
01:06:31,552 --> 01:06:34,575
If it doesn't kill you,
it makes you stronger.

1198
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:37,795
I think it's what made
me the nurse I am today.

1199
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:40,059
A damn good one, from
what I can tell.

1200
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,148
Thank you for that.

1201
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:44,063
And speaking of which,
how's the new patient?

1202
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,239
Is Gwen gonna be okay?

1203
01:06:46,263 --> 01:06:48,284
I heard she was
doing really well.

1204
01:06:48,308 --> 01:06:50,373
She's expected to
make a full recovery.

1205
01:06:50,397 --> 01:06:51,722
That is great.

1206
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:53,313
Yeah. She got lucky.

1207
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,640
You expecting company?

1208
01:06:56,664 --> 01:06:58,947
No.

1209
01:06:58,971 --> 01:07:00,557
Well, let's see who it is.

1210
01:07:00,581 --> 01:07:01,930
Coming!

1211
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:05,127
What are you doing here?

1212
01:07:05,151 --> 01:07:07,216
I came to see Lance.

1213
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:09,088
You're not welcome here, Ms.
Spade.

1214
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:10,504
- Lance!
- Hold on.

1215
01:07:12,506 --> 01:07:13,507
Lance.

1216
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,225
I've been so worried about you.

1217
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:17,849
I don't know what
happened the other day,

1218
01:07:17,873 --> 01:07:20,577
but I swear to you, I
didn't poison you.

1219
01:07:20,601 --> 01:07:23,711
Look Chloe, the police
are looking for you.

1220
01:07:23,735 --> 01:07:25,800
You need to check yourself in

1221
01:07:25,824 --> 01:07:27,628
and get yourself some
real help now, okay?

1222
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:29,543
I'm here to help you.

1223
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:32,372
I want to work for you again.
Please.

1224
01:07:32,396 --> 01:07:34,833
I think he's made himself
perfectly clear.

1225
01:07:36,487 --> 01:07:38,334
I'm supposed to be his nurse!

1226
01:07:38,358 --> 01:07:39,881
Not anymore you're not.

1227
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:26,339
And she didn't say
anything else?

1228
01:08:26,363 --> 01:08:27,775
No.

1229
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:29,639
She didn't try to force
herself in or anything.

1230
01:08:29,663 --> 01:08:31,474
She just left.

1231
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:33,737
This is just getting
so out of hand.

1232
01:08:33,761 --> 01:08:36,000
What did the detective say?

1233
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:38,090
Just that they're still
looking for her.

1234
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,961
Well, that's reassuring.

1235
01:08:39,985 --> 01:08:43,380
Brooke, baby... relax.

1236
01:08:44,772 --> 01:08:46,470
The police are
taking care of it.

1237
01:08:48,776 --> 01:08:50,667
Trust me...

1238
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:52,780
everything's gonna be fine.

1239
01:09:05,793 --> 01:09:08,120
Chloe Spade! This is
Detective Thames!

1240
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,424
Can you open up
the door, please?

1241
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:14,952
We have a warrant to
search the premises!

1242
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:17,041
I'm gonna need you to
open the door, ma'am!

1243
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:18,589
Ms. Spade!

1244
01:09:52,144 --> 01:09:53,189
Hello?

1245
01:09:54,384 --> 01:09:55,384
Hey, Barb.

1246
01:09:55,408 --> 01:09:57,038
Listen...

1247
01:09:57,062 --> 01:10:00,172
I'm not supposed to
share this with anyone,

1248
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,435
but I think you should know.

1249
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:05,288
Last night, Ms. Spade was
admitted to the hospital.

1250
01:10:06,463 --> 01:10:08,267
Seriously? What for?

1251
01:10:08,291 --> 01:10:09,920
Apparently she tried
to commit suicide.

1252
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:11,487
The cops found her.

1253
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:13,968
She took a lethal dose of
oxy, which I can only imagine

1254
01:10:13,992 --> 01:10:15,883
came from Lance's prescription.

1255
01:10:15,907 --> 01:10:18,842
Uh... Chloe tried to
kill herself last night.

1256
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:20,235
- She's in the hospital.
- What?

1257
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:21,628
How is she doing?

1258
01:10:21,652 --> 01:10:23,238
Well, she's stable.

1259
01:10:23,262 --> 01:10:26,198
The bigger question is whether
the doctor admits her

1260
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,721
to a psychiatric
hospital or not.

1261
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:29,288
My guess is that
he probably will,

1262
01:10:29,312 --> 01:10:30,811
but she's got at
least 24 hours here.

1263
01:10:30,835 --> 01:10:32,116
I thought you should know.

1264
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:34,510
Okay. Please keep us updated.

1265
01:10:34,534 --> 01:10:35,753
You bet.

1266
01:10:38,059 --> 01:10:40,299
This is insane.

1267
01:10:40,323 --> 01:10:42,281
Chloe tried to kill herself?

1268
01:10:45,197 --> 01:10:47,610
I think she must have felt
some serious guilt...

1269
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:49,419
after what she'd done to us.

1270
01:10:51,327 --> 01:10:53,007
Maybe it all just finally
caught up to her.

1271
01:10:53,031 --> 01:10:54,250
Yeah. Maybe.

1272
01:10:55,468 --> 01:10:56,924
I'm just glad they found her.

1273
01:10:56,948 --> 01:10:58,508
I hope she gets committed
somewhere soon

1274
01:10:58,532 --> 01:11:00,014
so she can't get near us again.

1275
01:11:00,038 --> 01:11:01,711
Yeah.

1276
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:03,824
Yeah. Me, too.

1277
01:11:17,011 --> 01:11:18,250
Hey.

1278
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,164
How's it goin'?

1279
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:22,036
Chloe's in the hospital.

1280
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,343
She tried to kill
herself last night.

1281
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:25,779
They're gonna hold her.

1282
01:11:25,803 --> 01:11:27,643
Hopefully they'll finally
commit her this time.

1283
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,435
Well, that's exactly
what she needs.

1284
01:11:29,459 --> 01:11:32,612
Yeah. I'm just glad that I can
leave Lance at home and not worry.

1285
01:11:32,636 --> 01:11:34,788
Nice to finally have
your life back, right?

1286
01:11:34,812 --> 01:11:35,943
Oh, yeah.

1287
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:45,929
Paul?

1288
01:11:45,953 --> 01:11:47,670
Hey, Barb.

1289
01:11:47,694 --> 01:11:50,891
Dr. Floyd just got the order to
prep Chloe Spade for transport.

1290
01:11:50,915 --> 01:11:53,633
- Wait. That's tonight?
- Apparently so.

1291
01:11:53,657 --> 01:11:55,659
All right. I'll get on it.

1292
01:12:05,712 --> 01:12:07,777
And how are we feeling, dear?

1293
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:09,388
We're alone.

1294
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:11,477
You can drop the
holier-than-thou act.

1295
01:12:11,501 --> 01:12:13,348
Well, fine.

1296
01:12:13,372 --> 01:12:15,394
Since we're sharing
our true feelings,

1297
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:18,353
I have to tell you, I'm a bit
disappointed in you, Chloe...

1298
01:12:18,377 --> 01:12:21,859
Trying to check out of the
job I paid you to do.

1299
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:28,929
But then I realized,
it's partially my fault,

1300
01:12:28,953 --> 01:12:31,801
what, with the placebo
pills and all.

1301
01:12:31,825 --> 01:12:34,369
Placebo?

1302
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:36,917
The ones I replaced your
anti-depressants with.

1303
01:12:38,789 --> 01:12:40,810
You gave me placebos?

1304
01:12:40,834 --> 01:12:43,552
Well, I had to tip
the scales somehow.

1305
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:45,097
God.

1306
01:12:45,109 --> 01:12:46,642
Your sex appeal wasn't
doing it on its own.

1307
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,904
That's why I was so messed up.

1308
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:49,602
You bitch!

1309
01:12:49,626 --> 01:12:51,821
Such language.

1310
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:53,910
We were only supposed
to mess with them.

1311
01:12:53,934 --> 01:12:55,695
I could go to jail for
attempted murder!

1312
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,523
You could go to jail for murder.

1313
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:58,785
What?

1314
01:12:58,809 --> 01:13:00,656
Don't worry.

1315
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,659
I'm gonna make absolutely
sure you don't go to jail.

1316
01:13:03,683 --> 01:13:06,183
Don't do me any
favors, all right?

1317
01:13:06,207 --> 01:13:07,687
I made up my mind.
When the cops come,

1318
01:13:07,711 --> 01:13:08,601
I'm telling them everything.

1319
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,623
No, no, no.

1320
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:13,103
Just let me do my job.

1321
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:14,931
And what does that mean?

1322
01:13:14,955 --> 01:13:17,456
I'm the best nurse
in this hospital.

1323
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:19,893
Just let me make it all better.

1324
01:13:19,917 --> 01:13:21,503
Just like I always do.

1325
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:22,939
I want nothing to do with this.

1326
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:24,114
Do you understand? I'm out.

1327
01:13:24,138 --> 01:13:25,551
Oh, I know.

1328
01:13:25,575 --> 01:13:27,379
Last night when they
brought you in here,

1329
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,990
I realized that you gave
me the perfect opportunity

1330
01:13:30,014 --> 01:13:34,061
to clean this whole thing
up nice and neat...

1331
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:38,302
just like I did with James.

1332
01:13:38,326 --> 01:13:39,632
James?

1333
01:13:41,068 --> 01:13:42,698
What did you to to J...

1334
01:13:42,722 --> 01:13:44,071
What the...

1335
01:14:37,298 --> 01:14:39,344
Now the big guy
comes up to bat...

1336
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:52,638
I really am sorry
about this, Chloe,

1337
01:14:52,662 --> 01:14:54,944
but I've seen so
many girls like you.

1338
01:14:54,968 --> 01:14:58,450
Trust me, you weren't
gonna get any better.

1339
01:15:15,206 --> 01:15:16,947
The first pitch...

1340
01:15:27,218 --> 01:15:28,543
Surprise!

1341
01:15:28,567 --> 01:15:30,414
Barb! Hey.

1342
01:15:30,438 --> 01:15:32,025
Is everything okay?

1343
01:15:32,049 --> 01:15:34,157
I just wanted to
check in on you.

1344
01:15:34,181 --> 01:15:35,541
I'll just put these
in the kitchen.

1345
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:37,698
Oh! Well, that's very...
sweet of you.

1346
01:15:42,059 --> 01:15:44,472
It is so sweet how he
likes to rub my feet

1347
01:15:44,496 --> 01:15:47,823
at the end of the day,
but they're so sweaty.

1348
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:51,305
I've been in these freaking
shoes for 12 hours.

1349
01:15:51,329 --> 01:15:52,480
- Marry him.
- Yeah.

1350
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:53,766
Hold on.

1351
01:15:57,335 --> 01:15:59,356
- This is Brooke Harmon.
- Hi, Brooke.

1352
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:01,402
This is Eric, Darren
Wells's brother?

1353
01:16:01,426 --> 01:16:03,622
- Well hello.
- I'm sorry to call you like this,

1354
01:16:03,646 --> 01:16:05,624
but I really need to warn you.

1355
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:08,844
Your nurse Barbara... she
isn't who she says she is.

1356
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:10,174
Wait. What did you say?

1357
01:16:19,009 --> 01:16:20,706
Cookies were delicious.

1358
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:24,904
I really appreciate you
stopping by, Barb.

1359
01:16:24,928 --> 01:16:28,148
I am just all of a
sudden exhausted.

1360
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:32,370
I think I'm just gonna crash.

1361
01:16:34,328 --> 01:16:38,482
That's because I put something
extra special in these cookies.

1362
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:40,702
Excuse me?

1363
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:43,749
You didn't think you were gonna
get away with it, did you?

1364
01:16:43,773 --> 01:16:45,751
What?

1365
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:47,840
Killing him.

1366
01:16:47,864 --> 01:16:49,842
Darren.

1367
01:16:49,866 --> 01:16:51,060
What are you talking about?

1368
01:16:51,084 --> 01:16:53,454
The man you ran over.

1369
01:16:53,478 --> 01:16:57,066
Left in the street bloody.

1370
01:16:57,090 --> 01:16:58,459
That was my fiancée...

1371
01:16:58,483 --> 01:17:00,616
Darren Wells.

1372
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:13,213
Barb...

1373
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:16,956
whatever pain we've caused
you, we've already paid for it

1374
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:19,591
tenfold with everything Chloe
put us through already.

1375
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,704
Chloe works for me.

1376
01:17:25,728 --> 01:17:28,315
I paid her to take care of you.

1377
01:17:28,339 --> 01:17:31,579
You paid Chloe to
try to kill me?

1378
01:17:31,603 --> 01:17:33,102
Nah.

1379
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:34,756
No, no.

1380
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:37,391
She's much too much
of a coward for that.

1381
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,719
I paid her to ruin your life

1382
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:42,396
like you ruined mine.

1383
01:17:43,789 --> 01:17:45,356
I'm the one that made you OD.

1384
01:17:46,705 --> 01:17:48,620
I'm the one that
wants to kill you.

1385
01:17:49,795 --> 01:17:52,165
And this time...

1386
01:17:52,189 --> 01:17:53,906
I'm not gonna fail.

1387
01:17:53,930 --> 01:17:55,472
Barb...

1388
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:57,934
Go to your happy place, Lance.

1389
01:17:59,805 --> 01:18:02,199
That would be right
here with me, bitch.

1390
01:18:09,032 --> 01:18:11,140
I can't feel anything.

1391
01:18:11,164 --> 01:18:12,751
Now where were we?

1392
01:18:12,775 --> 01:18:14,578
What did you do to me?

1393
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:17,538
- You don't have to do this!
- Back away from him, Barb!

1394
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:19,042
Honey, you got to be kidding me.

1395
01:18:20,565 --> 01:18:22,151
Okay...

1396
01:18:22,175 --> 01:18:24,153
Take it easy, Chloe.

1397
01:18:24,177 --> 01:18:27,113
If you help me out, I
can give you double.

1398
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:28,636
I'm not interested.

1399
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:30,638
You sure?

1400
01:18:30,662 --> 01:18:34,274
You could do a whole
lot with $5,000.

1401
01:18:36,102 --> 01:18:37,253
No!

1402
01:18:37,277 --> 01:18:39,715
Barb! Get off, Barb!

1403
01:18:45,329 --> 01:18:47,350
Barb, stop it!

1404
01:18:47,374 --> 01:18:49,265
Barb! Barb, please!

1405
01:18:49,289 --> 01:18:50,943
No!

1406
01:19:12,704 --> 01:19:15,030
- Oh...
- Honey.

1407
01:19:15,054 --> 01:19:16,447
Is she dead?

1408
01:19:17,970 --> 01:19:19,319
How did you know?

1409
01:19:20,843 --> 01:19:23,082
- I sent a card to Darren Wells's brother.
- What?

1410
01:19:23,106 --> 01:19:27,695
He called me and he said that Darren
was engaged to a nurse named Barb.

1411
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:29,436
Oh.

1412
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,244
I'm so glad you're okay.

1413
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:36,965
My hero.

1414
01:19:36,989 --> 01:19:39,751
Babe, it's over.

1415
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,796
- It's over.
- It's over.

1416
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,972
What about Chloe?

1417
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:45,345
Let's get her some help.

1418
01:19:55,878 --> 01:19:59,553
The first drink
I've had in ages.

1419
01:19:59,577 --> 01:20:01,033
So good.

1420
01:20:01,057 --> 01:20:02,382
Cheers.

1421
01:20:02,406 --> 01:20:03,470
Cheers!

1422
01:20:03,494 --> 01:20:06,236
Oh! And I got you...

1423
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:08,780
Mm!

1424
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,520
Salted caramel cake?

1425
01:20:10,544 --> 01:20:12,198
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

1426
01:20:15,636 --> 01:20:17,813
Thought it was about
time that I asked again.

1427
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:23,906
Might be a little hard for me to get
down on one knee at the moment, but...

1428
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:29,801
Well, I was actually
thinking that

1429
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,585
since I said no the first time,

1430
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:33,698
I should be the one to ask you.

1431
01:20:38,442 --> 01:20:40,139
Lance...

1432
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,361
will you marry me?

1433
01:20:49,105 --> 01:20:50,715
It's about damn time.

1434
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:00,005
- So is that a yes?
- Yes! That is a yes.

1435
01:21:00,029 --> 01:21:01,615
Okay. Good.

1436
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:04,052
- Does it fit?
- Let's see.

1437
01:21:04,076 --> 01:21:05,948
Let's put in on. Ah!
