00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:10,680
This film is dedicated to the
mothers, to those whose sons
have fallen on the sad plains

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,840
of Flanders, there where the countless
wooden crosses are planted...
the crosses of the Yser.

Roles: the old mother - the women
the old father - the eldest son
the youngest son - the girl

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,480
In a small town in
the north of France.

8
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,000
"So, mama, will all
be ready in time?"

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,000
"Don't worry, all will be ready."

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,880
"I'm not worried,
I just want to know."

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,760
"Is there anything
else to do, Mrs.?"

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:38,160
"Almost nothing, Brigitte, only
the flowers need to be placed."

13
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,000
"Now that everything is ready,
I will call them."

14
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,480
"Suzette!"

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,320
"Come all in, the table is ready."

16
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,400
"Papa!" "Mama!"

17
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,880
"Uncle John!"

18
00:06:48,520 --> 00:07:00,040
"My dear children. It's for mama
and me a great happiness, today,

19
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,000
to find our children
back around us."

20
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:24,840
"My dear Peter, my dear Lucy,
it's five years ago today
that you were united."

21
00:07:51,640 --> 00:08:08,320
"I hope it'll be granted to
me to attend this anniversary
many more times...

22
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:17,760
We harbour the best wishes
for your joint happiness...

23
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:27,040
And no less for our
dear little Suzette."

24
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,040
"It's the alarm bell!"

25
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,680
"Mobilisation!"

26
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,920
Army and Navy - Order
for general mobilisation.

27
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,840
Army and Navy - Order
for general mobilisation.

28
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:27,040
"Finally we will be able to
show them, that we are French."

29
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:58,440
The whole of France prepared
to defend itself with truly
admirable enthusiasm and unity.

30
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:12,440
A waving flag, a vibrating
Marseillaise and our love
then knows only the fatherland.

31
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:09,440
"Poor little ones, for them war
is but a flag swashing in the wind,
and the blaring of the clarions...

32
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:33,480
...but for me, who'se seen
1870, war is the disruption
of the entire life,

33
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:43,320
the destruction of cities,
children with hunger
and mothers who cry."

34
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:14,160
On all the roads of France
the soldiers go to the border.

35
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:54,040
"Come on, old man, a glass of wine.
To sing well you must drink well."

36
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,840
"I thank you, I'm not
thirsty right now.

37
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:21,000
"How, you're not thirsty?
But you've just yelled
to burst the throat."

38
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:18,680
And during that time, to replace
the men duty had called...

39
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:38,160
the franciscan sisters gather the
grain harvest to ensure the bread
that the land will need tomorrow.

40
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:07,560
Their delicate hands, unsuited
to that kind of work, with a
soic endurance wield

41
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,400
the heavy scythe of the mowers.

42
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,040
Under the grape fire.

43
00:23:51,360 --> 00:24:05,960
After two months of excessive
fatigue, two months of nights
without rest and fights without end...

44
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,760
the soldiers, missing everything,
hold on to the Yser in despair.

45
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:34,600
In the basement of a ruined house,
a few men have been placed, on outpost.

46
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:19,280
"Did you notice that "William"
is sending them to us
like pidgeons, this morning?

47
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:43,280
"Let's use that moment of
calming to relieve the
comrades down by the water."

48
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,960
"No, thanks, I'm too tired."

49
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:41,840
"Talk of bombardment! Eleven
dead, some sixty wounded
and that without an attack."

50
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:55,880
"I've seen near the white farm a shell
explode close to one of our men...

51
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:11,120
...Sadly I couldn't come to his
aid and I don't know who it is.

52
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:13,880
"My dear brother, I assure
you that I made it okay."

53
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:42,280
"That big Firmin, who was only a few
steps away from me, has had his belly cut
open this morning by a piece of shell"

54
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:06,120
"That brave Lambert too, was
killed close to the white farm."

55
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,120
"Dear god! How terrible is the war!"

56
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:16,720
"Rest a bit, my good man,
I... I'm going to write."

57
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,040
Hotel In bed they sleep.

58
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,960
"Outpost number five here."

59
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,960
"Understood! In half an hour."

60
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,240
"Bouchard!"

61
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:32,120
"You're the only one who hasn't
been on guard; so it's up to
you to take the mission."

62
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:44,880
"That's how I think about it
too, besides look at the boys,
they're all exhausted."

63
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:16,600
"On the other bank stands
the house of the ferryman."

64
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,880
"it's about exploding it."

65
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:49,320
"In the basement near an old suitcase
is a mine that we laid there when we
were still on the other side of the water."

66
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:15,520
"In half an hour it'll be dark
enough and old Achilles will
be there with his little boat..."

67
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:25,600
"...with the help of which
you can cross the Yser."

68
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:41,680
"Understood! In half an hour the
house of the ferryman will blow!"

69
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:08,440
"You see down there that cart,
you must pass it on the left."

70
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:36,120
"Corporal, I have still 15 minutes;
I'm going to finish the letter
I was writing to my wife."

71
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:44,800
"My poor John, why did
you go in my place?"

72
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,280
"That our little Suzette
would not lose her father."

73
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:20,320
"We must return down there
immediately. An effort, Jean,
I'll help you... Courage..."

74
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:09,960
On the plains of Flanders, under
the rattle of the machine guns,
and the booming of the canons...

75
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:09,440
The marine artillery of admiral
Ronarc'h have come to reinforce
the handful of Belgians...

76
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,800
...who cling desperately
to their native ground.

77
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,400
"Bayonets on the rifles!"

78
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,520
"Mother."

79
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,000
In a hospital at St. Georges.

80
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:04,440
"I'd like to write."

81
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:18,320
"Don't think about it! You forget,
that the major has perscribed
the biggest possible rest."

82
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:26,720
"You're unwise, you
will worsen the fever."

83
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,120
"I beg you, a few words."

84
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:05,000
"So be it, but no more
than two minutes."

85
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:26,720
"Poor chap... It would be a
miracle if he pulled through."

86
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,840
"Down there."

87
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:29,240
"Madam, here are two letters,
that were just delivered."

88
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,880
"Lucy, this one is for you."

89
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:56,140
...so that Jean and I are
since five days in an outpost
at the banks of the Yser.

90
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:10,520
Even though now and then we have
to face terrible bombardments,
it's going as well as it can.

91
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:31,080
At the moment that I write you, Jean
is here with me and charges me to
tell you that he embraces you all.

92
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:35,080
My dear parents, I write
to you from St. Georges where
I was brought two days ago 

93
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:35,080
because of an injury.
Do not worry yourself:
The nurse assures me

94
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:48,780
this morning that I'll be recovered
in a fortnight. Hope to see you soon

95
00:50:48,780 --> 00:51:02,440
and embrace little Suzette for me.
Your affectionate son Jean.

96
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:12,280
"My poor little one."

97
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:30,160
"Why worry yourself mama, if he
writes, that it isn't serious."

98
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:42,440
"I've got a premonition that he
isn't telling the whole truth."

99
00:51:57,120 --> 00:52:06,800
"Papa, he suffers! Our little
one calls for his mother perhaps."

100
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:15,320
"I beg you, papa, I want to see
him; I want to see my Jean again."

101
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:32,160
"Say, papa, Saint Georges is
not so far, let us go there!"

102
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:14,600
For hours and hours the poor mother,
exhausted from fatigue, found
in the love for her son...

103
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:21,400
...the power to continue
the bitter Calvary road.

104
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:59,080
"I am very tired papa, but that
is nothing, I am so happy, for
soon I will be near to him."

105
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:41,520
"Courage, mama, we
will soon be there!"

106
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:48,240
"Could you allow us on your cart,
we're going to Saint Georges."

107
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:57,720
"That is not possible, madamette,
and besides, it's forbidden!"

108
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:22,360
"I'm an old mother who goes to
see her son in the hospital...
Don't you have a mother as well?"

109
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:44,440
"I don't go until Saint Georges,
but climb on anyway, that will
save you a few kilometers anyway."

110
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:41,080
"How glad he will be,
our little one, to see us."

111
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,520
Having arrived near Saint Georges...

112
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:22,360
"Follow this road, it's straight ahead."

113
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:51,160
"Poor mother who won't
see her son again!"

114
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:19,720
A dreadful premonition
oppressed both poor seniors...

115
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:28,800
...and they continued their way
without daring to communicate
each other their thoughts.

116
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:17,080
"I would lile to see my son, sir."

117
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:31,720
"But there are a lot of sons here,
madam. What is your name?"

118
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
"Bouchard."

119
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:05,120
"Here is a mother who would like
to see her son, soldier Bouchard."

120
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:18,800
"Will you follow me,
I will bring you to him."

121
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,800
"So... he lives, doesn't he?"

122
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:41,680
"Why yes, madam, he lives...
although his injury is serious."

123
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,160
"Pierre!"

124
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:26,360
"So it's you, my Pierre?"

125
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:45,080
"But... then... your brother
Jean... where is he?

126
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:59,360
"Jean died of his injuries two
days ago and is being buried now,
mother, but he was a hero.

127
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:10,080
"How cruel is the war.
Thus thousands of victims from
families have fallen and for what."
