-She’s back at it again with me.
-Have you seen that childbirth movie?

3
00:00:22,997 --> 00:00:25,395
-No, no.
-The one they show to pregnant women.

4
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:29,332
They’re shooting a second
<i>The Birth Reborn</i>…

5
00:00:29,714 --> 00:00:32,083
The first one,
they shot it in several places.

6
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,956
And this one they’re shooting here, now.

7
00:00:35,718 --> 00:00:40,787
She’s here, Mom. She’s so beautiful.
She looks just like Juca.

8
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:43,667
Full black hair.

9
00:00:44,185 --> 00:00:49,086
Big cheeks. Folds of fat.
She’s delicious.

<i>What’s up?</i>

<i>He’s biting me.</i>

33
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:34,196
He’s biting me.

You wanna see Mommy?

THE BIRTH REBORN 2

36
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,463
Keep going. Keep going.

37
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:09,445
Come on, Mom! No use
trying to come down, Mom!

38
00:04:10,101 --> 00:04:12,182
Lift that butt back up.

39
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,332
Push! Don’t you come down!

40
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,113
Keep going! Keep going, Mommy!

41
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:19,232
Put your strength down here!
Keep pushing, keep pushing!

42
00:04:22,498 --> 00:04:24,927
No! Don’t say “haa, haa”.
Keep your mouth shut!

43
00:04:25,256 --> 00:04:27,147
You gotta hold your breath, don’t breathe!

44
00:04:31,882 --> 00:04:35,168
Keep pushing, Mommy!
Come on, don’t stop pushing!

45
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:38,480
Come on, come on, come on.

46
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:39,929
It’s stuck.

47
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:44,093
Come on, come on.
It’s getting out!

48
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:52,083
Don’t stop!
Don’t open your mouth!

49
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,782
No, Mommy! Help me here, Mommy!

50
00:04:55,234 --> 00:04:57,607
Come on, come on.
Keep going, keep going.

51
00:04:57,692 --> 00:04:58,695
Almost there.

52
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:02,961
Keep going, keep going.

53
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:04,797
Push, keep pushing!

54
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:07,944
No, he’s pulling at me.
I can’t do this.

55
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,685
He’s trying to help you.

56
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:12,022
Stop it, woman!

57
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,622
You’re holding the baby
inside you, look!

58
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:19,051
She’s pulling it back in.
Come on, Mommy. It’s here, look.

59
00:05:19,136 --> 00:05:21,514
It’s coming, it’s coming now!
It’s coming!

60
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:25,584
Push, push! Don’t stop!

61
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:27,997
You gotta push!
It’s almost getting out, come on!

62
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:32,218
There!

63
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:35,825
No! Don’t you touch it!

64
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:37,842
She contaminated everything.

65
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:39,886
Keep that hand down.

66
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:45,023
I’m sorry.

67
00:05:45,108 --> 00:05:47,320
You don’t get it, do you?
Look at this!

68
00:05:47,405 --> 00:05:50,448
-You can hold it. Hold it.
-Dammit!

69
00:05:51,827 --> 00:05:54,916
It’s all contaminated.
When it gets infected…

70
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:56,438
How could I know?

71
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:57,861
Keep that hand down.

72
00:06:00,112 --> 00:06:02,641
-Mommy, I’m gonna put this here.
-I didn’t know.

73
00:06:02,726 --> 00:06:05,584
Congratulations, sweetie!
You did great, beautiful!

74
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,688
Exactly! I was just giving
you some advice, I wasn’t…

75
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:13,300
Okay, Mommy? It’s okay, everything’s
under control, okay? Calm down.

76
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,435
It’s just a precaution, because when
you touch it, you contaminate it.

77
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,324
-But I didn’t know!
-I wasn’t yelling at you, woman!

78
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,906
Look at me here,
let’s go up a little.

79
00:06:19,991 --> 00:06:24,164
Relax, sweetie! Relax! Relax!

80
00:06:25,904 --> 00:06:28,413
Relax, everything went okay.
It was great!

81
00:06:28,498 --> 00:06:29,513
He’s okay,
everything’s okay, darling! Okay?

82
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,327
-I was just giving you advice.
-Calm down, he’s right over there.

83
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:35,031
He’s crying there, very calm.

84
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:46,093
15 MONTHS LATER

85
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,557
<i>We’re doing a Brazilian documentary</i>

86
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:56,081
<i>about delivery and childbirth.</i>
<i>Whom might I talk to about it?</i>

87
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,262
<i>According to the doctors, let’s say,</i>

88
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:05,796
<i>I was already 42 weeks pregnant.</i>
<i>The baby was going to die.</i>

89
00:07:06,046 --> 00:07:09,946
<i>The doctor said, “Let’s make a C-section.”</i>
<i>I hesitated, but, well,</i>

90
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,851
<i>42 weeks and a half.</i>

91
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:17,263
<i>I went to the hospital, my water broke.</i>

92
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:22,201
I was left practically
from midnight to 4:30 AM

93
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,797
completely alone in a room

94
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,218
with oxytocin dripping into my veins.

95
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:31,406
It was like a insecurity, fear actually.

96
00:07:31,905 --> 00:07:34,287
“May I get up?
Am I not allowed to?

97
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:36,738
I need to go to the bathroom.”

98
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:39,821
<i>I think I wasn’t even allowed</i>
<i>to drink or eat anything.</i>

99
00:07:39,906 --> 00:07:42,259
<i>They’re prepping you for the C-section.</i>

100
00:07:43,709 --> 00:07:49,255
Not one soul came to tell me,
“Look, this is what’s happening.

101
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,918
We’re gonna do this and this.
We’re gonna wait until such time.” Nobody.

102
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:58,436
<i>Actually, I only found out</i>
<i>what oxytocin was much later.</i>

103
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:02,311
I didn’t even know what it was
they were pumping into my blood.

104
00:08:02,835 --> 00:08:04,010
I know the law.

105
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,316
<i>My husband didn’t know where I was.</i>

106
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,910
You know why you can’t?
The hospital director won’t let you.

107
00:08:10,994 --> 00:08:12,230
Wanna know why?
I’m gonna explain.

108
00:08:12,321 --> 00:08:14,691
Here in this hospital,
like in any other hospital,

109
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:17,750
there isn’t a structure
for every single patient…

110
00:08:17,835 --> 00:08:19,369
-The law…
-Let me finish!

111
00:08:19,535 --> 00:08:22,480
For every little patient
in their cubicle, nice and cozy.

112
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,526
All those women, all of them,

113
00:08:25,726 --> 00:08:29,454
are breastfeeding, naked. That’s why.
Just out of respect for them.

114
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,572
You wanna get in?
A cop comes here at 3 AM.

115
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,823
-We’re just doing our jobs…
-This law was passed back in 2005.

116
00:08:35,077 --> 00:08:40,962
You… We don’t have,
we don’t have…

117
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:46,153
“Hospitals, maternity wards
and the like are bound by law

118
00:08:46,322 --> 00:08:49,497
to allow the presence of an escort
indicated by the pregnant woman

119
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:52,035
to assist her during labor,

120
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,199
during delivery and after,
for a period of up to ten days.

121
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,218
This applies to all hospitals in Brazil,
be them private or public.”

122
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:07,420
<i>I arrived at the hospital</i>
<i>with a nine centimeters dilation.</i>

123
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:11,139
All of a sudden, a guy came in
pushing a gurney, and he said,

124
00:09:11,498 --> 00:09:14,931
“Hey, why are you still dressed?
We gotta get you to surgery.

125
00:09:15,016 --> 00:09:16,215
Go strip, now!”

126
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:23,789
The people responsible for
the medical staff, the doctor on duty,

127
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,226
could he come and speak with us?

128
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,700
With PR?

129
00:09:32,777 --> 00:09:36,741
I had a very unnatural
“natural” birth, actually.

130
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,167
Oxytocin and all.

131
00:09:40,986 --> 00:09:44,312
One, two and… Push! Come on!

132
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:47,098
I was 18 years old,
and I didn’t have any say in it.

133
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:49,692
How do you do? My name is Anne…

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,948
Throughout my whole
pregnancy I’d been told,

135
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:54,386
“Either you do a C-section
or you’re gonna die.

136
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,749
You gotta do a C-section
or you’re gonna die.

137
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:58,999
You gotta do a C-section
or you’re gonna die.”

138
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:03,257
And I grew up in a family where
doctors are always right.

139
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,784
So I was gonna die. If I didn’t do
the C-section, I was gonna die.

140
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,260
I suffered a lot, because…
“I’m gonna have a baby

141
00:10:09,345 --> 00:10:10,910
and I won’t get to know my baby,
because I’m gonna die.”

142
00:10:11,018 --> 00:10:14,643
Do you want to put a rag under here?
Otherwise it'll make such a mess.

143
00:10:16,302 --> 00:10:18,380
Through your nose!

144
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,624
They kept doing touch exams all the time.

145
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,647
They wouldn’t let me have a sip of water.

146
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:32,298
They wouldn’t let me eat.
I felt like a caged animal.

147
00:10:40,311 --> 00:10:43,178
“Doctor, must I lie down?
I feel okay, I wanna sit.

148
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:46,120
I’m not comfortable lying down,
I’m not okay.”

149
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:50,113
“Sit down, then. Sit down because
we’re gonna give you anesthesia.”

150
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,675
“You chose to deliver this way.
Now live with it.”

151
00:10:58,383 --> 00:11:03,629
Small talk in the delivery room,
people giggling.

152
00:11:03,714 --> 00:11:06,994
<i>They’re recording.</i>
<i>Keep it quiet or it’s not gonna look nice.</i>

153
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,715
<i>We can cut it out in the editing room.</i>

154
00:11:16,204 --> 00:11:17,630
“This is your waiver.”
“This is your waiver.”

155
00:11:17,714 --> 00:11:19,714
<i>And Pedro, my husband,</i>
<i>read it and said, “Here says</i>

156
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,670
<i>that I won’t hold the doctor</i>
<i>responsible for anything! Is that it?</i>

157
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,706
If I don’t sign this,
you won’t let me in?”

158
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:30,985
And the girl said, “We won’t.”
So I signed everything.

159
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:33,061
I just signed a bunch of stuff,
a huge wad of forms.

160
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,506
It was crazy. And people kept
signing all that paperwork.

161
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:38,604
So many suitcases,
getting to the hospital was an ordeal.

162
00:11:39,256 --> 00:11:42,200
Check-in ended at 6:30 PM.
It looked like a hotel.

163
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:45,540
I was there from… I don’t know,
6:30, the time I checked in,

164
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,916
till 10:30 PM waiting for
that C-section thing,

165
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:53,384
and that late at night, inside surgery,

166
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:58,465
the AC was freezing cold,
and I was naked, with my belly…

167
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,530
waiting… all alone!

168
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:14,296
You see a movement in health in
the opposite direction, you know?

169
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:19,151
Towards afflicting or putting in danger

170
00:12:20,182 --> 00:12:22,107
women’s health, children’s health,

171
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,244
by the doctors, you know?

172
00:12:25,183 --> 00:12:29,137
For ethical reasons,
it’s very complicated.

173
00:12:29,222 --> 00:12:35,670
I’m a doctor, so that’s
a huge conflict for me.

174
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,726
<i>We have an ancestral memory of</i>
<i>what violence is in this country.</i>

175
00:12:38,811 --> 00:12:42,627
<i>We’ve had 500 years building</i>
<i>violence, racist,</i>

176
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:46,495
sexist, classist violence.
And now, obstetric violence.

177
00:12:46,609 --> 00:12:50,241
Verbal abuse, especially
of a sexual nature.

178
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,539
“You didn’t scream that loud
when you were doing it.

179
00:12:53,624 --> 00:12:55,573
Why are you screaming now?”

180
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:58,513
Humiliation, shame, degradation.

181
00:12:58,713 --> 00:13:01,292
They’re gonna slice her vagina,
they’re gonna sit on her stomach.

182
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:04,296
Performing routine episiotomy on all women

183
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:07,381
or an episiotomy just
to speed up the process.

184
00:13:07,466 --> 00:13:10,810
Many times, these women are cut up
without even being told about it.

185
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,789
Many times, without anesthesia.
They scream then, saying,

186
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:17,529
“I don’t wanna be cut!” And the
doctor cuts them up anyway.

187
00:13:17,859 --> 00:13:22,580
Incontinence, she won’t be able to
have a pleasurable sex life anymore.

188
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:26,388
It’s a woman’s right, guaranteed by law.

189
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,615
They want to crouch,

190
00:13:28,952 --> 00:13:32,623
but they’re forced to lie
down, they’re held down, even.

191
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,078
“Cruelty and torture like
a concentration camp”

192
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:39,252
was a description repeated
by dozens of women

193
00:13:39,337 --> 00:13:41,259
who didn’t know each other
from all over the country.

194
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:44,619
<i>It’s impossible to understand that</i>
<i>a doctor would lie to their patient</i>

195
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:48,011
<i>about the effective medication</i>
<i>to perform a C-section on a woman.</i>

196
00:13:48,142 --> 00:13:52,587
<i>Both the C-section and the</i>
<i>episiotomy are surgical procedures.</i>

197
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:55,405
According to the Criminal Code,
which is already very old,

198
00:13:55,644 --> 00:13:58,950
the Medical Ethics Code
and the Civil Law Code,

199
00:13:59,251 --> 00:14:01,500
a surgical procedure cannot be performed

200
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:03,166
against the will of the patient,

201
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:07,244
unless there really is an
imminent risk of death for them.

202
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:12,147
Verified imminent risk of death and
authorization from the next of kin.

203
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:15,995
Every person has a right
to life, to safety,

204
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:21,988
to non-violence, to health. In 2014,
the World Health Organization

205
00:14:22,073 --> 00:14:26,216
released an official note taking
the same position on the subject,

206
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:31,424
that abuse, mistreatment or omission
of adequate health treatment

207
00:14:31,534 --> 00:14:33,371
constitute a human rights violation.

208
00:14:33,535 --> 00:14:37,606
It is the patient’s right to decide
what they approve or disapprove.

209
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:39,446
So that’s an informed choice.

210
00:14:39,531 --> 00:14:43,743
The Medical Ethics Code
determines expressly

211
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:46,202
that it is a doctor’s duty to hear
out their patients, to give them

212
00:14:46,297 --> 00:14:49,848
adequate information based
on scientific evidence.

213
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:52,329
It is the doctor’s duty
to keep their knowledge up to date.

214
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:57,203
<i>Some hospitals, in order to circumvent</i>
<i>the obstetric violence issue,</i>

215
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,957
are now issuing a “delivery plan”
to pregnant women,

216
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:05,185
a document where women say what they
will accept and what they won’t.

217
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:09,377
But it is a pre-issued adhesion term.
It’s not a valid document

218
00:15:09,657 --> 00:15:14,068
because the choice wasn’t free, clear
and informed, as the law determines.

219
00:15:14,337 --> 00:15:16,906
Enough violent deliveries
to sell C-sections.

220
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,233
-Is it over?
-Yeah.

221
00:16:41,347 --> 00:16:43,528
-It lasted long, didn’t it?
-One minute ten.

222
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:48,203
I’m already eight centimeters dilated.
I am.

223
00:16:48,812 --> 00:16:54,173
Three at six, then another one at 6:30.

224
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:00,652
This is a marathon, isn’t it, folks?

225
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,042
There’s still a lot of cervix to dilate,

226
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:05,909
but her head is very low.
You’re doing fine.

227
00:17:06,381 --> 00:17:10,172
You found your balance, understand?

228
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:13,801
-And the açaí.
-The açaí gave you energy for sure.

229
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:19,311
I had an accident when
I was seven years old

230
00:17:20,196 --> 00:17:22,453
and they had to amputate my legs.

231
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:26,958
And they made me think
I really was in no condition

232
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:28,898
to have a normal delivery.

233
00:17:29,294 --> 00:17:32,469
My whole life I had
to break barriers, always,

234
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,855
while someone said, “Ah, you can’t”,
or “you’re not capable of doing that”.

235
00:17:37,883 --> 00:17:40,009
The first doctor I went to,

236
00:17:40,094 --> 00:17:42,482
he kinda stared at me

237
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:45,358
as if he was about to ask,
“How did you do that?

238
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:47,043
How did you get pregnant?”

239
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,410
I left and didn’t come back again.
So I went through a lot of doctors.

240
00:17:50,495 --> 00:17:52,907
I even had to hear that
my pelvis wasn’t opening,

241
00:17:52,992 --> 00:17:54,908
that my body was too small.

242
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:58,247
Having a baby was something they saw like:

243
00:17:58,332 --> 00:18:00,565
“Poor thing, she’s gonna suffer.”

244
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,776
My pregnancy was very peaceful,

245
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:05,219
the only thing I had was stomach sickness,

246
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,765
and they insisted that mine
was a high-risk pregnancy.

247
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,803
And I was like,
“High risk to whom?” Right?

248
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:12,416
Because I’m fine, my baby is fine.

249
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:27,211
Like, I used to get sick a lot,

250
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,639
to the point of having to inject

251
00:18:30,724 --> 00:18:33,220
a very strong drug called Zofran.

252
00:18:33,305 --> 00:18:35,810
So Rodrigo had to give me the shots.

253
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:38,146
I couldn’t even go to the drugstore,
because one day I went there

254
00:18:38,346 --> 00:18:40,737
and I fainted in the drugstore.
So my pregnancy, in the beginning,

255
00:18:40,822 --> 00:18:43,666
was very messed up because
of all the sickness.

256
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:46,735
And when I went to have
my ultrasound, he was like,

257
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,725
“How are you?”
“I’m feeling awful.”

258
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:51,000
“But why do you feel like that?”
“Because I feel sick all the time,

259
00:18:51,085 --> 00:18:53,286
just looking at your face
makes me wanna throw up.”

260
00:18:53,486 --> 00:18:56,619
I was in such a foul mood
because I couldn’t do anything,

261
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:59,872
I was always feeling sick, about
to throw up. I couldn’t eat,

262
00:18:59,957 --> 00:19:01,645
I couldn’t brush my
teeth, nothing, you know?

263
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,836
So he said, “Well, if
you’re feeling so sick,

264
00:19:05,921 --> 00:19:08,362
I suppose there could be even
more than one in there.” And I…

265
00:19:09,762 --> 00:19:11,677
Those two hearts beating like that.

266
00:19:11,762 --> 00:19:13,210
He said, “Look, there’s two here.”

267
00:19:14,117 --> 00:19:16,132
And I was like, “No, not two.”
“No, they’re really two babies.”

268
00:19:16,217 --> 00:19:18,694
Rodrigo was weeping, lying on
the couch, and I was like,

269
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:21,226
“No, that’s not possible.”
“It is, too. Look at the screen.”

270
00:19:21,311 --> 00:19:23,135
Then I looked and I went, “Damn.

271
00:19:23,285 --> 00:19:28,474
Will I manage to hold these
two little guys inside me,

272
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,996
to deliver and raise
these two little guys?”

273
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:34,105
So the first thing
I felt was a lot of fear.

274
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:37,584
But right away you begin to feel

275
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:39,973
very happy, doubly happy.

276
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:44,934
LACK OF DILATION

277
00:19:45,148 --> 00:19:48,037
BODY BUILDERS OR ATHLETES

278
00:19:48,236 --> 00:19:51,380
BABY “TOO SMALL”

00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:54,069

SEDENTARISM - CLOTS IN THE

NEAR-SIGHTEDNESS

289
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:26,981
BABY SWALLOWING AMNIOTIC FLUID

290
00:20:27,181 --> 00:20:31,353
HEAVY URBAN TRAFFIC

291
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:37,850
The amniotic fluid, at the very least,

292
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:41,559
by the pregnancy’s third trimester
is basically the baby’s urine.

293
00:20:41,644 --> 00:20:43,644
The baby has to swallow it in order
to form the digestive tract,

294
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:45,939
the respiratory system,
the baby has to breathe the fluid.

295
00:20:46,133 --> 00:20:50,978
When you have an elective
C-section at 37 weeks,

296
00:20:51,229 --> 00:20:53,127
what the couple is told

297
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,289
is that the baby was swallowing fluid,

298
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:57,501
so it’s got liquid in its lungs.

299
00:20:57,662 --> 00:21:00,204
Going through labor squeezes the lungs

300
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:02,818
and reduces the amount of liquid
when the baby is born.

301
00:21:02,903 --> 00:21:05,396
The baby’s feet were
stuck between the ribs,

302
00:21:05,596 --> 00:21:07,897
so it couldn’t be a vaginal birth.

303
00:21:08,445 --> 00:21:11,346
So there’s no uterus or
amniotic sac either, right?

304
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:13,531
Yeah, the baby’s all loose in there.

305
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:17,095
Hanging on the mother’s
ribs for dear life.

306
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,995
A friend of mine was also pregnant.

307
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:21,868
She took a lot of vitamins and
had an ultrasound every month.

308
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,598
“My doctor didn’t prescribe me that.
No, she didn’t prescribe this exam.”

309
00:21:24,727 --> 00:21:27,022
“Don’t you think your doctor is
way too negligent with you?”

310
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,513
I think the retinal detachment
was one of the most…

311
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,284
“You’re 8/20 nearsighted.

312
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,108
If you make any physical effort,
your eyes are gonna pop out.”

313
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:40,336
He suckled, he was held,
all the procedures

314
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:42,773
we consider adequate for the baby.

315
00:21:42,967 --> 00:21:46,025
“Shouldn’t we wait? Because I
had to wait for my other kid.

316
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:47,870
Aren’t you gonna give him a bath?

317
00:21:47,964 --> 00:21:50,583
You’ll leave him dirty? Are you
gonna put his clothes on like that?”

318
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,965
When the mother went to her room,
we quickly went to the nursery

319
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:56,958
to weigh the baby, measure
him and put his clothes on.

320
00:21:57,075 --> 00:22:00,548
The lady was very nervous and
she asked to talk to me.

321
00:22:00,788 --> 00:22:03,305
“No, I won’t put him in the incubator,
me and the mother agreed on that,

322
00:22:03,499 --> 00:22:05,573
it’s what’s best for the baby,
he’s already been held and breastfed.”

323
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:09,003
“But what about the incubator picture?”
“No, no incubator picture.”

324
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:11,112
People have this culture…

325
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:25,233
Carmem and Tom were born
during the 39th week.

326
00:22:25,318 --> 00:22:29,396
This was all I heard: “A twin
pregnancy is a high-risk pregnancy.”

327
00:22:29,568 --> 00:22:34,481
She was cephalic and he was breech,
60 hours since my water broke:

328
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:37,770
“Heartbeats are fine,
both babies are fine,

329
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:40,320
 you’re fine, we’ll monitor it.”

330
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:45,945
Are you having contractions?

331
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:49,311
One thing I really wanted
to feel was this expulsion.

332
00:22:49,496 --> 00:22:52,829
The passage through the canal,
the crowning.

333
00:22:59,436 --> 00:23:01,673
He came straight into my arms,
it was beautiful,

334
00:23:01,885 --> 00:23:04,521
Rodrigo cut the umbilical cord

335
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,839
and he was like this,
right behind me the whole time.

336
00:23:06,924 --> 00:23:08,975
His presence, his comfort,

337
00:23:09,092 --> 00:23:11,764
so loving, so beautiful, like this.

338
00:23:13,329 --> 00:23:15,845
Held the gauze.

339
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:25,612
Breathe. Great. Beautiful.

340
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,813
It’s… it’s…

341
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:33,018
Everything’s okay,
everything’s okay.

342
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,939
Your place is here.

343
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:40,388
I wanna go to the hospital.

344
00:23:40,593 --> 00:23:42,792
This is what we’ll do:

345
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,627
breathe deep and keep calm.

346
00:23:45,813 --> 00:23:48,204
You eat something and then
we go to the maternity ward.

347
00:23:48,848 --> 00:23:49,900
Okay?

348
00:23:50,409 --> 00:23:52,790
Gently, there’s no hurry.

349
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,102
Okay? We’re right here,
we’ll do it in your time.

350
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:03,762
That’s it!

351
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,918
The sac!

352
00:24:12,088 --> 00:24:14,531
Beautiful!

353
00:24:26,957 --> 00:24:29,395
That’s it, let her come!
She’s beautiful!

354
00:24:32,716 --> 00:24:34,685
Beautiful!

355
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,071
It’s my baby!

356
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,120
My love!

357
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:45,747
My little baby!

358
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:22,155
There’s a tribe where they say that
any baby who is born inside the sac

359
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,070
grows up to be very lucky in life.

360
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:27,382
Blessed.

361
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,736
<i>Sofia Feldman Hospital begins by meeting</i>

362
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:39,932
<i>the demands and needs of expecting women.</i>

363
00:25:40,102 --> 00:25:42,678
<i>It’s a counter-hegemonic model,</i>
<i>so to speak.</i>

364
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:45,328
<i>An assistance geared more</i>
<i>towards the community.</i>

365
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:50,254
<i>Good practices based on evidence,</i>

366
00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:52,324
<i>which is the way to build knowledge.</i>

367
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:54,878
<i>Innovative initiatives</i>

368
00:25:55,123 --> 00:25:58,178
<i>that end up becoming public policies.</i>

369
00:25:59,428 --> 00:26:02,359
We’ve always allowed
patients to bring escorts,

370
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:04,342
way before it was passed into law.

371
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,807
The first child ever
to be born in this hospital,

372
00:26:06,922 --> 00:26:10,969
the whole family was here.
That was more than 30 years ago.

373
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,765
It’s about human rights, so,

374
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:16,724
how can a woman go through
a moment like that alone?

375
00:26:54,302 --> 00:26:55,751
If she wants to have the baby
at home, we go to her home.

376
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:57,880
If she’d rather deliver at the hospital,
we assist her in there.

377
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:00,363
If she wants to go to a birth house,
we assist her there.

378
00:27:00,448 --> 00:27:02,505
It has to be a low-risk pregnancy,

379
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,496
without complications,
be them high blood pressure or diabetes.

380
00:27:05,816 --> 00:27:07,574
We bring all the necessary materials.

381
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:09,877
The same care we’d give her in a hospital,

382
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,849
we follow the same evidence.

383
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:30,250
She lives 30 minutes away from
the hospital, from Sofia Hospital.

384
00:27:30,335 --> 00:27:32,741
If she needs to be transferred,
that’s where she’ll go.

385
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,418
In one of the hospital’s ambulances.

386
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:55,522
I had all the support a person needs

387
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:57,604
in order to do the antenatal.

388
00:27:57,873 --> 00:28:01,778
And I gave birth crouching, right?
Which really makes it easy.

389
00:28:02,322 --> 00:28:05,267
Alice Jennifer has jaundice,

390
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:07,466
so she’s in treatment now.

391
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:09,783
We’re not talking
only about biological health,

392
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,332
a broader vision of health,
with vinculation,

393
00:28:13,421 --> 00:28:15,688
with gentleness, with love,
with affection,

394
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:18,657
that’s another condition
for this baby to develop

395
00:28:18,742 --> 00:28:20,728
and be a healthy adult as well.

396
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:12,924
And then I went through
all that again, you know?

397
00:29:13,926 --> 00:29:15,648
There was another one.

398
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:18,639
After all that,
there was still another one.

399
00:29:46,929 --> 00:29:48,904
<i>Let’s just talk about soccer.</i>

400
00:29:49,774 --> 00:29:53,359
<i>Ah, no. Not about</i>
<i>Corinthians. For God’s sake.</i>

401
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:55,882
<i>-What team do you support?</i>
<i>-I’m a Corinthians fan.</i>

402
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,775
<i>I was informed that the</i>
<i>doctors were gonna say…</i>

403
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,795
<i>The “normal” delivery,</i>
<i>abnormal, actually…</i>

404
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:03,432
<i>I didn’t even know what it was</i>
<i>they were pumping into my blood.</i>

405
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:07,281
<i>You gotta do a C-section</i>
<i>or you’re gonna die.</i>

406
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:09,368
<i>You gotta do a C-section</i>
<i>or you’re gonna die.</i>

407
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:13,578
<i>I know what the law says, son!</i>

408
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:16,219
<i>The hospital won’t allow it.</i>

409
00:30:16,304 --> 00:30:17,836
Are you gonna go against the law?

410
00:30:18,378 --> 00:30:20,078
Are you gonna go against the law?

411
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,428
Officer, she’s trying
to go against the law.

412
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:25,185
So the law won’t be obeyed, then.

413
00:30:25,422 --> 00:30:27,189
Yeah, yeah, Jorge.
Director, no one…

414
00:30:27,274 --> 00:30:30,397
Okay, son.
I won’t go against any laws.

415
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,478
He can’t get in, can he? Okay.

416
00:30:32,621 --> 00:30:34,617
Is he going in and he’ll be there
with all the other patients?

417
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,681
The director won’t allow it
just because of that.

418
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:39,441
Because all the other patients
are in that same place,

419
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:42,445
all of them naked, all…
that’s disrespecting the other patients.

420
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:43,546
Unfortunately.

421
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:46,922
She was born without labor,
at 38 weeks,

422
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:51,473
from an undesired,
coerced elective C-section… here.

423
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,986
Blue in the face from crying.
But away from my baby.

424
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:56,891
It’s very, very upsetting!

425
00:30:57,476 --> 00:30:59,023
Monitored visit, right?

426
00:30:59,386 --> 00:31:02,011
May I know how it’s gonna be monitored?
As a mother?

427
00:31:08,959 --> 00:31:12,544
Customer service.
So what’s the number?

428
00:31:19,136 --> 00:31:20,310
Okay.

429
00:31:22,329 --> 00:31:24,018
“You’re not dilated enough.”

430
00:31:24,264 --> 00:31:26,137
They didn’t give me time to dilate.

431
00:31:26,228 --> 00:31:28,484
I didn’t have any contact at all with her.

432
00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:31,525
I only got to see Luiza
12 hours after she was born.

433
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:42,623
Nine years later, I got pregnant.

434
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,695
“I want a natural birth.”

435
00:31:45,355 --> 00:31:46,430
“You can’t have it.”

436
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:49,709
-“Why not?”
-“You already had a C-section

437
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:51,870
and you’re too old.”

438
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:55,161
“Old?” I was 31.

439
00:31:58,337 --> 00:32:01,040
<i>Look at Luiza.</i>
<i>She’s making faces, look.</i>

440
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,479
<i>Can I schedule this visit with you?</i>

441
00:32:05,564 --> 00:32:10,589
Because then, when I get clearance,
I’m gonna have that ready.

442
00:32:18,565 --> 00:32:21,077
-You have kids, right?
-Yeah, a girl and a boy.

443
00:32:21,162 --> 00:32:25,286
They were C-sections, so it was scheduled.

444
00:32:25,597 --> 00:32:29,582
Did she go into labor? Or was
it a scheduled C-section?

445
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,474
-Was it scheduled?
-It was scheduled.

446
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,723
Were they breastfed, the babies?
In the delivery room?

447
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:37,122
No. No.

448
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:39,838
The child only comes to the room
when the mother is also in the room.

449
00:32:39,923 --> 00:32:41,965
Those who come to visit also ask,

450
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,756
“Where? Where is she? Where?”

451
00:32:43,841 --> 00:32:47,362
Was he put in that fish tank,
that nursery? Your babies?

452
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:49,591
-They did.
-Mine too.

453
00:32:49,862 --> 00:32:51,267
With a little camera on top of him.

454
00:32:51,352 --> 00:32:53,399
And you could look at him
through the camera, right?

455
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:55,643
-From the room.
-From the room, right?

456
00:32:55,728 --> 00:32:58,148
Yeah, there was a normal TV set in there.

457
00:32:58,233 --> 00:33:01,318
-Did you watch the surgery?
-No, I tried not to look at it.

458
00:33:01,403 --> 00:33:05,123
I saw the baby coming out.
But I didn’t look at my wife,

459
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:10,209
because of the cut. I kept holding
her hand and she squeezed mine.

460
00:33:11,108 --> 00:33:13,937
Then, when they brought the baby,
she couldn’t hold him either

461
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:16,175
-because she was strapped, I think.
-She couldn’t.

462
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:21,823
They broke my water.
Then he actually gets on top of me,

463
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:25,337
he steps on a stool or a ladder,
I mean, he put the palm of his hand

464
00:33:25,427 --> 00:33:29,122
and pressed down with all his weight
on my belly. It was brutal.

465
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,466
They performed an episiotomy
on me without my knowledge.

466
00:33:32,617 --> 00:33:36,769
Without information or consent.
They cut me up.

467
00:33:38,926 --> 00:33:41,585
Yes, I’d like to take pictures
and record it.

468
00:33:43,735 --> 00:33:46,777
And let me ask you another thing,

469
00:33:47,088 --> 00:33:49,359
would it be possible for me
to sit and talk to a doctor,

470
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:53,713
to someone in charge of the staff?
About the procedures that are done

471
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:56,597
in the maternity ward when a baby is born.

472
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:02,259
A woman doctor came to see me,
there was another touch exam,

473
00:34:02,926 --> 00:34:04,792
then she broke my water,

474
00:34:05,115 --> 00:34:10,458
they did an awful episiotomy
which still hurts today.

475
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:16,081
I feel pain from my episiotomy,
physical pain.

476
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,216
With my legs up, like this…

477
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,725
and he applied the Kristeller maneuver.

478
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:33,516
It was ultraviolent.
There was no need for that.

479
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,632
The baby was coming out already.

480
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,123
<i>What’s the director’s name?</i>
<i>Could I talk to him?</i>

481
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:43,518
<i>In order to talk to the director,</i>
<i>you have to schedule a meeting.</i>

482
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:48,511
I was four centimeters dilated already,

483
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:51,712
so I was doing fine.
And I went into C-section.

484
00:34:51,797 --> 00:34:53,686
He said, “we can’t wait anymore,

485
00:34:53,947 --> 00:34:55,491
we can’t wait for a natural birth,

486
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:58,358
because you might die
if you had a natural birth.

487
00:35:00,568 --> 00:35:03,165
<i>I’m calling customer service</i>
<i>because I want to find out</i>

488
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,660
<i>whether I can make a monitored tour</i>
<i>of the maternity ward, taking pictures.</i>

489
00:35:07,745 --> 00:35:11,911
<i>The line is busy, please try again later.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

490
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:16,179
I remember very vividly the doctor saying,
“Gee, I slit his butt.”

491
00:35:16,663 --> 00:35:19,022
Because when he cut me,
he also cut my baby up.

492
00:35:19,676 --> 00:35:21,163
He’s still got a scar.

493
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:24,074
He’s got a cut in his butt,
it’s gone up a little.

494
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:26,899
But it wasn’t a little cut. It was a cut.

495
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:59,063
The Belém, Pará Convention,
an international treaty

496
00:35:59,148 --> 00:36:03,165
signed and ratified by Brazil,
deliberates that any conduct

497
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,213
which causes physical, psychological,
sexual or moral harm to a woman

498
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:13,213
is gender violence.
Besides being negligence.

499
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:16,681
It’s more than malpractice.
It’s more than negligence.

500
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:20,866
Who are the people who get access
to that kind of information, right?

501
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:23,619
Are they getting access
to that in the community?

502
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:29,018
Obstetric violence is violence
against women in the sexual sphere.

503
00:36:29,346 --> 00:36:30,954
Very akin to rape.

504
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,577
The reports that come to us tell that
under obstetric violence, women feel

505
00:36:36,709 --> 00:36:40,837
the same way a sexually raped woman,

506
00:36:40,922 --> 00:36:42,548
a woman who was raped, feels.

507
00:36:44,852 --> 00:36:47,305
No one has rights on anyone else’s body.

508
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,592
Even at childbirth, even babies.

509
00:36:50,766 --> 00:36:52,613
Who wants to be a victim
of sexual violence?

510
00:36:52,698 --> 00:36:55,151
Would you want to acknowledge
your torturer?

511
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:57,007
Would you want to say that the doctor,

512
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:59,801
the one who was there at
the moment of your delivery,

513
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,326
the most special day in your life

514
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:05,321
because there’s also all this
romantization of motherhood

515
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:08,658
was someone who committed violence
against you and against your baby?

516
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:12,883
It’s about the struggle for valuing
childhood, for respecting children.

517
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:16,847
“Why do you wanna keep talking
about that, about black women?

518
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:19,305
We’re all equal, we want the same things.”

519
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,995
No. Sometimes, what a white woman wants

520
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,634
is different from what a black woman
or what a native Brazilian woman

521
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,352
or a woman in a wheelchair
want, for instance.

522
00:37:28,437 --> 00:37:30,663
She’ll struggle for accessibility issues

523
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:36,083
which I, as a woman who can
walk, don’t even notice,

524
00:37:36,237 --> 00:37:38,011
because I have all this access.

525
00:37:38,262 --> 00:37:40,092
So my struggle is different from hers,

526
00:37:40,177 --> 00:37:42,285
but I have to take her
struggle into consideration.

527
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,893
Collectively,
I cannot depend on information.

528
00:37:45,527 --> 00:37:48,419
Collectively, what’s going to save us
are public policies.

529
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:51,706
And mass invasions by
women at those places

530
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:55,567
where public policies are issued,
which today are dominated by men.

531
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:42,625
I was already 39 weeks pregnant
and they wouldn’t get out.

532
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:45,038
My belly was bulging out my back already.

533
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:46,658
It expanded to the sides, my belly.

534
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:50,959
Then one day a little liquid came out.

535
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,311
So he said, “Let’s go to the hospital,

536
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,758
because I think we
shouldn’t wait anymore.”

537
00:38:55,718 --> 00:38:59,242
Rodrigo, if he could,
he’d get pregnant for me.

538
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:02,596
He mounted a camera on his
head, on a baseball cap,

539
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:04,635
he got it all set up to record the birth,

540
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,659
so we have the whole
process filmed FPV by him.

541
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:11,377
And it was so moving, it was really great.

542
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:21,392
I was in labor for eight hours,

543
00:39:21,563 --> 00:39:24,749
I began to feel a lot of
pain with the contractions.

544
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:28,666
There’s something I would do
differently if I got pregnant again,

545
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:32,144
which is the anesthesia.
I couldn’t feel my legs.

546
00:39:32,268 --> 00:39:34,511
That was very frustrating,
because I really wanted to…

547
00:39:34,596 --> 00:39:37,582
I mean, I practice yoga,
breathing techniques, I work out,

548
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:41,424
I’m such an athlete, I bench-press,
I’m always in the gym,

549
00:39:41,578 --> 00:39:43,870
and I think I could have pitched in more

550
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:47,025
when it was time to push
for the expulsion, you know?

551
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:49,329
And I couldn’t do it because
I couldn’t feel my legs,

552
00:39:49,414 --> 00:39:51,463
and I found that out when I
wanted to go to the bathroom.

553
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:53,681
“Can I go pee?”
“I think you won’t be able to.”

554
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,411
Then when I tried to get up
I was like, “Damn.”

555
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:05,439
My twins were born ten minutes apart.

556
00:40:12,448 --> 00:40:17,190
I didn’t have the pleasure of
breastfeeding them like in the soaps,

557
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:20,453
which look like they stay
there for hours, swap tits,

558
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:23,737
then you look at them a bit more.
It’s always very quick,

559
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:25,570
because you’re breastfeeding one
and the other is already crying,

560
00:40:25,655 --> 00:40:30,631
it’s like they’re always sensing
each other, following each other.

561
00:40:30,716 --> 00:40:32,438
So I’m nursing one baby and
the other one is there waiting,

562
00:40:32,523 --> 00:40:36,107
he’s waiting in line, holding his horses.
That was when it sunk in,

563
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:39,457
how hard it is to raise twins,
it’s really like running a marathon.

564
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:48,546
I had children during my
internship as an obstetrician.

565
00:40:48,631 --> 00:40:50,760
I went early to the hospital,

566
00:40:50,845 --> 00:40:53,894
got all the usual shtick
about interventions,

567
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:57,492
and I saw myself having a C-section.
It was a shock. Very frustrating,

568
00:40:57,606 --> 00:41:00,059
I couldn’t understand what
it was that went wrong,

569
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:02,604
but now I know that it
was completely necessary.

570
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:05,511
And that didn’t result in what I wanted,

571
00:41:05,595 --> 00:41:07,728
because I had a second
baby through a C-section.

572
00:41:08,297 --> 00:41:12,377
She was breech, I tried an external
cephalic version before the C-section.

573
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:15,369
Artificially, from outside the womb,

574
00:41:15,454 --> 00:41:19,096
we turn the baby upside down.
Every four moms we try that,

575
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:21,853
usually we manage
to turn one baby that way.

576
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,765
If we give her medication

577
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,570
to suppress womb contractions,

578
00:41:25,671 --> 00:41:30,094
we’re able to turn one more of
these four babies, that is, 50%.

579
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:32,688
And if we resource to anesthesia,
an anesthetic that is similar

580
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:35,735
to the one used in C-sections, we can
turn the third baby. So, in general,

581
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,768
out of every four attempts of cephalic
version, we manage to do three.

582
00:41:38,853 --> 00:41:42,595
She was turned into cephalic, but then,
next day, she was sitting again.

583
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:45,188
A scientific paper was just out,

584
00:41:45,354 --> 00:41:47,175
saying that it had to be a C-section.

585
00:41:57,397 --> 00:42:01,063
Let it go slowly. Let go.

586
00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:04,085
When I got my third pregnancy,
my daughter,

587
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:06,501
I went in search of scientific evidence.

588
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:09,205
It was a wonderful experience,

589
00:44:09,598 --> 00:44:12,923
every contraction,
every minute was worth it.

590
00:44:28,051 --> 00:44:30,129
I can’t believe I did it.

591
00:44:33,544 --> 00:44:38,153
Hi, sweetie. Evelyn…

592
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:41,579
Evelyn…

593
00:44:44,416 --> 00:44:45,860
We did it.

594
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:52,256
What an adventure you had today, girl.

595
00:44:52,388 --> 00:44:54,984
See, love? Didn’t I tell you it
was a good idea to pack a bag?

596
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:08,453
<i>The English National System</i>
<i>is a value for English society,</i>

597
00:45:08,538 --> 00:45:11,755
<i>so we want to turn Brazilian</i>
<i>public health care into a value,</i>

598
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:16,391
<i>an unquestionable asset</i>
<i>for the Brazilian population.</i>

599
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:48,217
Going against
the flow of Brazilian history,

600
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:51,274
we’re managing to reduce
C-sections in Belo Horizonte.

601
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,035
Death of the mother, death of infants

602
00:45:54,271 --> 00:45:56,329
from birth-related causes.

603
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:20,880
-It’s a girl!
-It’s a girl!

604
00:46:23,458 --> 00:46:25,380
Oh, my God!

605
00:46:26,976 --> 00:46:31,869
There are places in the world where
they even give money to women

606
00:46:32,144 --> 00:46:34,170
to have their babies at home.

607
00:46:36,922 --> 00:46:40,588
<i>That free childbirth at home may</i>
<i>become a public health policy.</i>

608
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,452
It is the woman’s right to choose
where she wants to have her baby,

609
00:46:43,752 --> 00:46:45,982
if adequate conditions are provided.

610
00:46:53,566 --> 00:46:58,869
It’s not someone in a white lab coat,
all sterile and cold,

611
00:46:58,954 --> 00:47:03,733
but a friend who pushes the piano
to make room for the inflatable pool,

612
00:47:03,846 --> 00:47:07,660
to get you a chair quickly,
to back you up, to warm up the water.

613
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:19,574
When Ayomide was born, it was…

614
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,666
it was unique.

615
00:47:37,992 --> 00:47:39,863
Men don’t cry.

616
00:47:41,341 --> 00:47:43,971
They say men don’t cry. But…

617
00:47:56,984 --> 00:47:59,837
I can’t compare
that with any other moment.

618
00:48:41,216 --> 00:48:44,038
-The afterbirth.
-Look at the circle here.

619
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,878
-What a beautiful afterbirth, folks.
-Beautiful. Very special.

620
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,206
-Look at this ring!
-So beautiful.

621
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:56,575
-And my baby is getting her milk.
-Beautiful!

622
00:49:05,634 --> 00:49:06,907
There, like that.

623
00:49:11,793 --> 00:49:15,186
-It feels great like that.
-Great, huh?

624
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:22,675
-You guys think I’ll manage?
-Of course, you will!

625
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:26,494
-You are managing already.
-You think?

626
00:49:27,276 --> 00:49:29,003
-Of course!
-I’m beginning to get afraid.

627
00:49:29,686 --> 00:49:31,490
It’s okay. You’ll overcome your fear.

628
00:49:31,575 --> 00:49:32,640
Fear of what?

629
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:36,092
Of not being able to take it anymore.

630
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,618
If you ever feel you can’t take
it anymore, then we’ll talk.

631
00:49:41,257 --> 00:49:44,453
We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.

632
00:49:44,538 --> 00:49:47,021
I usually say I don’t make deliveries.

633
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:49,976
You make the delivery.
The woman makes it.

634
00:49:57,818 --> 00:50:00,837
The more we see science advancing,

635
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:03,357
the more we tend to do nothing.

636
00:50:03,453 --> 00:50:05,752
Those who do real obstetrics

637
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:10,851
in its truest sense, practice “obstare”,
“being at someone’s side”.

638
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:19,283
The births that give me
the most satisfaction are those

639
00:50:19,368 --> 00:50:23,025
where I sit on my hands and do nothing,
I just observe.

640
00:50:23,363 --> 00:50:26,126
You don’t need so much technology

641
00:50:26,211 --> 00:50:27,777
in order to give quality care.

642
00:50:27,915 --> 00:50:31,677
It’s counter-intuitive, because
we used to do things the right way,

643
00:50:31,877 --> 00:50:33,840
then we began doing it all wrong, and now

644
00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:36,697
we have to prove, through science,

645
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:39,318
that what we used to do
before was the right way.

646
00:50:49,789 --> 00:50:51,648
Let her hold her.

647
00:51:00,837 --> 00:51:04,056
-Oh, baby.
-Look at Mommy, sweetie.

648
00:51:05,049 --> 00:51:06,549
I love you. Too much even.

649
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:16,585
-My baby.
-You can hold him.

650
00:51:16,997 --> 00:51:18,944
My beautiful baby!

651
00:51:20,713 --> 00:51:23,929
-I can’t believe this.
-He’s here.

652
00:51:26,896 --> 00:51:30,372
-He’s okay.
-He’s okay.

653
00:51:35,227 --> 00:51:39,457
We did it. Me and you.

654
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:43,228
With a lot of special guests.

655
00:51:45,532 --> 00:51:46,674
Look at his face.

656
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:49,228
Look how beautiful you’ll grow up to be.

657
00:51:49,313 --> 00:51:52,441
-You’re gonna be very pretty.
-You’ll be beautiful!

658
00:51:55,248 --> 00:51:57,041
-Gee, bless you!
-He loves his dad.

659
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,870
Are you gonna learn
how to change his diapers?

660
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,455
-I think I’m gonna have to.
-“I think I’m gonna have to”!

661
00:52:53,446 --> 00:52:56,814
NARROW PELVIS BEFORE LABOR

662
00:52:56,899 --> 00:53:01,253

UMBILICAL CORD STRANGULATION
-AND I WAS BORN AT HOME

673
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:37,043
PATIENT “DOES NOT HELP
WITH NATURAL BIRTH”

674
00:53:37,128 --> 00:53:40,062
OUT OF ROOM IN THE MATERNITY WARD

675
00:53:44,673 --> 00:53:46,581
All over the world, what do we see?

676
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:50,938
An attempt not to go over 42 weeks.

677
00:53:51,151 --> 00:53:56,703
Because after 42 weeks, your chances
of having natural birth are reduced.

678
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,538
Here in Brazil, it’s 40.
Forty weeks, you do a touch exam,

679
00:54:01,162 --> 00:54:05,162
“Gee, the baby’s too high,
the cervix is closed, it won’t fit.

680
00:54:05,462 --> 00:54:07,485
It won’t fit anyway,
why would you wanna wait?”

681
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:11,963
It’s a euphemism to take
the edge off of the word “surgery”.

682
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,114
Birth, the woman gave birth.
“Shall we schedule your delivery?”

683
00:54:15,429 --> 00:54:17,468
You don’t schedule a delivery,
You schedule surgery.

684
00:54:17,553 --> 00:54:19,514
However, I won’t tell
that woman in my office

685
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,917
that we’re scheduling her surgery.

686
00:54:22,515 --> 00:54:26,024
But the crux of the matter is what’s
being sold to that woman: safety.

687
00:54:26,765 --> 00:54:28,427
Natural birth must become again an option

688
00:54:28,512 --> 00:54:31,535
for Brazilian women.
It’s not an option anymore.

689
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:35,089
Humanized C-section was a
controversy in some courses,

690
00:54:35,174 --> 00:54:37,630
and such humanization is based especially

691
00:54:37,853 --> 00:54:40,354
in putting the woman in the central role.
You go to a C-section

692
00:54:40,439 --> 00:54:43,212
and women often lose their central roles.

693
00:54:43,297 --> 00:54:45,675
When you say “humanized C-section”,

694
00:54:45,861 --> 00:54:48,157
you reinforce the birth industry we have.

695
00:54:48,242 --> 00:54:52,815
In my C-section, they dimmed the lights,
there was music, skin contact.

696
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:54,924
I’d say it’s a respectful C-section.

697
00:54:55,009 --> 00:54:58,498
Humanization means much
more than something nice,

698
00:54:58,583 --> 00:55:02,842
with scented oils, music playing
and dimmed lights. First of all,

699
00:55:02,927 --> 00:55:05,908
humanization means working with
current scientific evidence.

700
00:55:06,599 --> 00:55:09,975
I only found a doctor in my 30th week.

701
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:12,501
And he joked about it, he said to me,

702
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:17,618
“Whales give birth and they have no legs.
So it’s gonna be easy for you.”

703
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:21,631
They said, “In ten minutes, tops,
the second baby will come.”

704
00:55:22,162 --> 00:55:24,047
Okay, then. Tom, come on.

705
00:55:28,072 --> 00:55:30,099
It took way longer than that.

706
00:55:32,114 --> 00:55:34,251
At one point,
I was begging for a C-section.

707
00:55:34,336 --> 00:55:37,191
“For God’s sake!
I can’t take this anymore!”

708
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:07,122
<i>“You chose to deliver this way.</i>

709
00:57:07,207 --> 00:57:08,588
<i>Now live with it.”</i>

710
00:57:08,673 --> 00:57:10,589
<i>Touch exams all the time.</i>

711
00:57:10,674 --> 00:57:13,776
<i>“Sit down, then. Sit down, because</i>
<i>we’re gonna give you anesthesia.”</i>

712
00:57:13,861 --> 00:57:16,370
<i>They wouldn’t let me have a sip of water.</i>

713
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,987
<i>Must I lie down? I feel</i>
<i>okay, I wanna sit.</i>

714
00:57:20,112 --> 00:57:22,718
<i>So I was gonna die. If I didn’t do</i>
<i>the C-section, I was gonna die.</i>

715
00:57:22,803 --> 00:57:24,680
<i>…with oxytocin dripping into my veins.</i>

716
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:29,487
In training hospitals,
we heard a statement from a woman

717
00:57:29,572 --> 00:57:33,137
who told us that eight different
people performed touch exams on her.

718
00:57:33,337 --> 00:57:38,668
And in that same delivery,
she suffered two episiotomies

719
00:57:38,921 --> 00:57:42,075
to practice episiotomy and suture.

720
00:57:42,237 --> 00:57:45,440
Let us build intolerance
to obstetric violence.

721
00:57:45,643 --> 00:57:48,688
It is marked on women’s bodies,

722
00:57:48,818 --> 00:57:53,594
on babies’ bodies, on the soul of
all these people involved at birth.

723
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:09,000
-I have to schedule a meeting, right?
<i>-You have to talk to his secretary.</i>

724
00:58:09,275 --> 00:58:11,890
It’s even funny,
because they’re already like, “But why?

725
00:58:12,084 --> 00:58:14,961
Why do you wanna record it?
Why do you wanna record it?”

726
00:58:15,102 --> 00:58:20,955
Concerning schedules,
that’s more of a technology thing,

727
00:58:22,451 --> 00:58:25,473
it has to do with the advances
of medicine in that field.

728
00:58:26,249 --> 00:58:30,197
We have a lot of data in Brazil
about iatrogenic prematurity,

729
00:58:30,282 --> 00:58:33,325
as they call it,
which is forced prematurity.

730
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:39,569
<i>People even think that medication</i>

731
00:58:39,737 --> 00:58:42,843
<i>and medicalization are the same thing,</i>
<i>and they’re not.</i>

732
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,317
<i>Medications exist to help us.</i>

733
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:48,239
<i>Medicalization is a social construct</i>

734
00:58:48,406 --> 00:58:53,454
<i>that makes us see natural things</i>
<i>from a medical perspective.</i>

735
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:59,093
<i>That began specifically,</i>
<i>in childbirth management,</i>

736
00:58:59,352 --> 00:59:05,219
in the 16th century, when midwives,
godmothers and healers

737
00:59:05,428 --> 00:59:09,513
were removed from the birth scene
and replaced by men,

738
00:59:09,598 --> 00:59:13,148
who were considered
the recipients of scientific knowledge.

739
00:59:13,338 --> 00:59:20,023
It was an appropriation by men
of science with technique and technology.

740
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:22,444
During the Fifties, a movement began

741
00:59:22,782 --> 00:59:26,440
against cruelty on pregnant women
in the USA

742
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:28,685
and Europe, especially in England,

743
00:59:28,910 --> 00:59:31,118
where women gave birth
while they were unconscious,

744
00:59:31,553 --> 00:59:35,222
physically restrained. They didn’t
have any recollection of the delivery

745
00:59:35,327 --> 00:59:38,247
because of the amount
of memory-impairing drugs.

746
00:59:38,350 --> 00:59:42,259
They came back from it with bruises
on their wrists and ankles.

747
00:59:42,517 --> 00:59:44,973
Many times, they had scars
from falling off the bed,

748
00:59:45,058 --> 00:59:47,485
because the medication induced
psychomotor agitation

749
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:51,116
and they fell off the bed, so they
had to be strapped down to deliver.

750
00:59:56,577 --> 00:59:58,930
They showed me Pedro and took him away.

751
00:59:59,255 --> 01:00:01,336
There wasn’t any skin contact.

752
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:04,874
“If you don’t tie your tubes
along with the C-section

753
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:07,153
and you get pregnant again,
you’re gonna die.”

754
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:19,437
They performed another C-section
because I was gonna die

755
01:00:20,488 --> 01:00:22,179
and they tied my tubes.

756
01:00:28,227 --> 01:00:31,873
And then my baby daughter was born,
I wanted to hold her.

757
01:00:32,147 --> 01:00:34,463
“No, no, no. You can’t…
put down that arm!”

758
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:38,133
Because I was full of oxytocin and
I didn’t know what that was either.

759
01:00:39,205 --> 01:00:41,169
The marketing department’s number.

760
01:00:42,018 --> 01:00:45,340
They ripped off the afterbirth,
they simply pulled it off.

761
01:00:45,486 --> 01:00:46,969
That hurt a lot as well.

762
01:00:50,955 --> 01:00:54,165
In the Sixties, with the Hippie
movement and the feminist movement,

763
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,408
there was strong contestation
of authorities in general,

764
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,530
including medical authorities.

765
01:00:59,905 --> 01:01:03,169
Childbirth is a moment of
empowerment for the woman,

766
01:01:03,254 --> 01:01:06,447
it’s the moment where she takes
control over her own body,

767
01:01:06,752 --> 01:01:08,709
where she has an active attitude.

768
01:01:08,794 --> 01:01:10,501
My mom was already in the room.
I looked at my mother

769
01:01:10,586 --> 01:01:12,307
and I told her,
“Mom, they cut me up.”

770
01:01:21,455 --> 01:01:23,246
And then my mom said to me,

771
01:01:26,188 --> 01:01:28,053
“No, girl. That’s normal.”

772
01:01:29,083 --> 01:01:33,465
I said,
“It’s not normal. I’m in pain.”

773
01:01:34,979 --> 01:01:36,757
And then, when Mom
took me to the bathroom,

774
01:01:36,842 --> 01:01:41,758
she said, “Look, don’t be scared.
It’s gonna hurt.

775
01:01:43,202 --> 01:01:45,411
Don’t be shocked when you touch it.”

776
01:01:48,098 --> 01:01:51,412
I just kept looking at her
and saying, “Why?

777
01:01:53,614 --> 01:01:57,191
Why did they do this?”
And she couldn’t answer me either.

778
01:01:58,371 --> 01:02:01,498
Feminism is, maybe, the hardcore,
the great inspiration

779
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,947
for this criticism
and for debating obstetric violence.

780
01:02:04,032 --> 01:02:08,256
This knowledge
of medical obstetric gynecology

781
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:11,230
and of medicine in general is,
to a great extent,

782
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,861
a misogynous one, which stems
from the idea that women are even

783
01:02:13,946 --> 01:02:15,649
incapable of being doctors.

784
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:19,625
There’s a whole biological explanation
of women being irrational creatures,

785
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,540
incapable of having any
objective scientific thinking.

786
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:26,726
This is why they need to be
protected by men, by institutions.

787
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:33,061
Feminism is the struggle for
a woman’s right to decide

788
01:02:33,146 --> 01:02:35,889
about herself, about her own life,
about her own body.

789
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:40,167
For more protagonism,
for a voice, for space,

790
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:44,356
for equity, which is different
from equality, isn’t it?

791
01:02:44,505 --> 01:02:48,938
It’s not about being equal to men,
but about having the same rights as men.

792
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:51,884
Deserving respect
is intrinsic to human beings.

793
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:53,389
No one should have to earn respect.

794
01:02:53,597 --> 01:02:55,480
That’s a very common mistake,
people thinking

795
01:02:55,565 --> 01:02:57,449
that feminism is
the opposite of male sexism.

796
01:02:57,543 --> 01:03:00,332
It’s an institutionalized model

797
01:03:00,582 --> 01:03:02,689
which is deeply seated
in patriarchal logic

798
01:03:02,818 --> 01:03:05,735
power and domination over women’s bodies.

799
01:03:05,894 --> 01:03:08,890
The medical discourse is impregnated,
most of all,

800
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:12,376
with fear of the feminine,
fear of childbirth.

801
01:03:16,556 --> 01:03:18,557
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

802
01:03:18,932 --> 01:03:24,181
There’s this fantasy that after
such a giant phallus, the baby,

803
01:03:24,265 --> 01:03:28,868
goes through the vagina, the phallus
of the partner will get lost in there.

804
01:03:29,037 --> 01:03:31,877
So the woman ceases to be a sex object

805
01:03:31,962 --> 01:03:34,662
to be a worn-out,
used, loose person,

806
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:37,413
and that has no basis on the
best of scientific evidence.

807
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:40,250
Spontaneous childbirth can actually,
according to some,

808
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:45,528
propitiate a better-toned
vagina than before,

809
01:03:45,813 --> 01:03:49,450
but in the professionals’ view,
the fact of having a vaginal birth

810
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:53,963
is a threat,
because the woman wouldn’t be able

811
01:03:54,048 --> 01:03:56,232
to satisfy her partner sexually anymore.

812
01:03:57,551 --> 01:04:01,928
Jokes… doctors comment that
they’re gonna close it up more.

813
01:04:02,013 --> 01:04:03,708
With João’s pregnancy,
that was when I found out

814
01:04:03,793 --> 01:04:07,184
that after Juliana’s episiotomy
I received one extra stitch,

815
01:04:07,269 --> 01:04:09,173
the so called “husband’s stitch”.

816
01:04:13,537 --> 01:04:17,341
We mustn’t ruin this amusement park here.

817
01:04:21,559 --> 01:04:24,717
Let’s make the smallest cut possible.

818
01:04:26,104 --> 01:04:31,123
It’ll just squeeze through. Tightly.

819
01:04:37,013 --> 01:04:39,066
Congratulations to you guys.

820
01:04:40,135 --> 01:04:43,452
In order to change the world,
we must first

821
01:04:43,537 --> 01:04:45,669
rescue women’s self-reliance,

822
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:49,162
because women themselves are the
ones who will change childbirth.

823
01:04:51,028 --> 01:04:54,774
I think this is that
thing you talked about.

824
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,205
Oh, love!

825
01:05:06,966 --> 01:05:08,696
Oh, love!

826
01:05:12,753 --> 01:05:14,810
It’s strong!

827
01:05:16,857 --> 01:05:19,453
Beli! Beli!

828
01:05:54,603 --> 01:05:57,736
<i>What’s nice about having staff you trust</i>

829
01:05:57,946 --> 01:06:02,530
<i>is that there’s no frustration</i>
<i>afterward for having a C-section.</i>

830
01:06:02,615 --> 01:06:06,444
<i>Because I know it was necessary.</i>

831
01:06:06,757 --> 01:06:10,880
-Can I try another one, then?
-You can, I told you that.

832
01:06:11,023 --> 01:06:14,672
-Not right away, you know?
-I told you could try again.

833
01:06:15,062 --> 01:06:17,362
-Another natural birth?
-Another natural birth.

834
01:07:30,498 --> 01:07:34,219
We stay about four hours after
the delivery to follow through,

835
01:07:34,304 --> 01:07:36,765
to make sure that the mother-child bond
has been established,

836
01:07:36,850 --> 01:07:39,663
that the baby has been breastfed.
We leave only when everything’s okay.

837
01:07:39,753 --> 01:07:43,080
We’re available on the phone.
If she needs any member of the staff

838
01:07:43,171 --> 01:07:46,684
to go back to her home, it’s all there.
She can make lunch,

839
01:07:46,898 --> 01:07:51,036
she can go up, take a bath
and go about her business

840
01:07:51,121 --> 01:07:53,081
and enjoy the company of her baby.

841
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,530
Public health can work.
It’s still a young public health system

842
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,416
and everyone depends on it.

843
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:04,540
Anyone who goes out to have
dinner at an expensive restaurant

844
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:06,908
is depending on public health,
because sanitary inspections

845
01:08:06,993 --> 01:08:09,849
at that restaurant are done
by Sanitary Vigilance,

846
01:08:09,934 --> 01:08:12,206
which is an organ integrated into
the unified public health system.

847
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:14,167
People forget that sometimes.

848
01:08:14,602 --> 01:08:19,080
It covers, of course, 200 million people
and helps directly in all the phases,

849
01:08:19,165 --> 01:08:22,428
from disease prevention,
promotion and recovery of health,

850
01:08:22,513 --> 01:08:24,462
including procedures of top complexity

851
01:08:24,546 --> 01:08:26,486
for 150 million people.

852
01:08:26,732 --> 01:08:29,014
It’s the largest public
health system in the world!

853
01:08:29,232 --> 01:08:32,053
Not even China’s is bigger.
China has 1.3 billion people,

854
01:08:32,138 --> 01:08:33,716
but it has no public health system

855
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:35,712
covering 150 million people.

856
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,544
Full of diapers in there.

857
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:48,233
This little girl made me get to
moments I’d never thought of before.

858
01:08:57,470 --> 01:09:00,585
My deepest fear in childbirth
was that it’d be a C-section.

859
01:09:00,687 --> 01:09:01,841
Then she turned.

860
01:09:03,953 --> 01:09:06,131
I started having two-minute contractions.

861
01:09:07,493 --> 01:09:09,359
“No time to do the version anymore.

862
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:13,982
Breech she is, and we’ll have
to make the delivery that way.”

863
01:09:14,707 --> 01:09:16,468
That moment was very intense, right?

864
01:09:16,776 --> 01:09:20,395
Two hours. For those who were there,
it felt practically like one week.

865
01:09:20,669 --> 01:09:24,683
And when she was born, of course
that was very intense for me,

866
01:09:24,768 --> 01:09:27,033
and I began to see that things
didn’t look like they were

867
01:09:27,124 --> 01:09:30,067
the way we had planned,
and I became even more afraid.

868
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:41,176
Mariana!

869
01:09:45,564 --> 01:09:46,819
She’s beautiful!

870
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:06,388
Look who’s here!

871
01:10:21,889 --> 01:10:25,014
Help me. Why is it like that?

872
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:27,292
Because she was like that for a long time,
but the swelling will go away.

873
01:10:27,377 --> 01:10:29,388
-That’s the hump.
-Does it go away?

874
01:10:29,473 --> 01:10:32,497
It does.
It’ll be back to normal.

875
01:10:32,582 --> 01:10:35,295
I drove home peacefully,
feeling great.

876
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,444
Next day, I was taking care of my baby.
I gave her a bath.

877
01:10:38,711 --> 01:10:40,719
<i>Even when I’m not here anymore,</i>

878
01:10:40,857 --> 01:10:43,284
<i>a little bit of me somehow will still be,</i>

879
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:45,104
<i>it’s my Part II.</i>

880
01:10:48,285 --> 01:10:50,164
-Can I take a picture here?
-Of course.

881
01:10:50,249 --> 01:10:52,102
Can I take a picture here?

882
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:01,605
Show me where it is.
I’m coming, okay?

883
01:11:03,312 --> 01:11:05,574
Now she’ll go to the nursery.

884
01:11:06,837 --> 01:11:08,797
Are we going to shoot here? Her exit.

885
01:11:08,882 --> 01:11:10,084
She’s going away.

886
01:11:11,562 --> 01:11:13,897
We can’t follow them anymore, right?
We can’t.

887
01:11:14,349 --> 01:11:16,677
-Are you going out?
-I’ll go there. It’s better, right?

888
01:11:16,762 --> 01:11:18,083
She needs to change.

889
01:11:21,388 --> 01:11:22,562
This is Aunt Fátima.

890
01:11:23,122 --> 01:11:27,541
Bye, Luiza! What now?

891
01:11:27,626 --> 01:11:30,097
Now she goes to the nursery.
In about three hours,

892
01:11:30,182 --> 01:11:31,903
she should be back in the room again.

893
01:11:31,988 --> 01:11:33,360
-Who?
-The baby.

894
01:11:35,777 --> 01:11:38,796
Four years later, what I still
can’t wrap my head around

895
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:41,539
is that they fooled me
into tying my tubes.

896
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:45,460
Just because I had three children,
is it over? Can I not have any more?

897
01:11:45,589 --> 01:11:47,998
One of the most frequent
kinds of complaint we get

898
01:11:48,083 --> 01:11:50,182
is about oxytocin abuse

899
01:11:50,312 --> 01:11:52,826
to make women go through labor quickly,

900
01:11:52,911 --> 01:11:56,029
freeing up hospital beds, even though
doctors, hospitals, won’t confirm it.

901
01:11:56,114 --> 01:11:59,757
25% of all women experience some
kind of childbirth violence,

902
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:02,592
and many aren’t even aware that
they were subjected to it.

903
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,015
I wanted that to end quickly.

904
01:12:05,433 --> 01:12:10,728
That was my childbirth.
That was my baby daughter, you know?

905
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:12,917
One out of every four women,

906
01:12:13,002 --> 01:12:15,324
according to a study by the
Perseu Abramo Foundation,

907
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,258
experience natural birth.

908
01:12:18,726 --> 01:12:21,246
Now, what’s the percentage
of Brazilian women

909
01:12:21,331 --> 01:12:22,824
who are having natural childbirth?

910
01:12:22,925 --> 01:12:27,808
It’s a minority.
That means this number is much higher,

911
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:30,515
because it doesn’t take into
account the number of women

912
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,374
who have C-sections and are
victims of obstetric violence.

913
01:12:34,998 --> 01:12:38,943
Fiocruz’s research
Being Born in Brazil proves

914
01:12:39,065 --> 01:12:42,786
the kind of obstetric violence
that every type of woman suffers.

915
01:12:42,871 --> 01:12:46,434
So, affluent women
suffer the obstetric violence

916
01:12:46,519 --> 01:12:48,385
of having unnecessary C-sections,

917
01:12:48,543 --> 01:12:50,943
but they get a nice room service.

918
01:12:51,028 --> 01:12:54,821
Some people think that having
hotel service at a hospital is good care.

919
01:12:54,932 --> 01:12:57,598
I don’t think women should be
forced to have natural deliveries.

920
01:12:57,752 --> 01:13:01,958
I fight for the right
of women to be well informed

921
01:13:02,048 --> 01:13:04,638
and choose their elective C-sections.
That’s not my problem.

922
01:13:04,723 --> 01:13:07,905
My problem is those who want
a natural delivery and can’t get it.

923
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,976
Vulnerable, I think that’s the word.

924
01:13:11,381 --> 01:13:13,285
They simply strapped me down

925
01:13:14,150 --> 01:13:17,159
and I insisted that I
wanted a natural delivery.

926
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,199
After they stitched me up,

927
01:13:22,284 --> 01:13:26,452
after all the C-section procedures,
they let me loose and showed me

928
01:13:26,537 --> 01:13:31,575
my daughter like this,
10, 15 centimeters away from me.

929
01:13:38,019 --> 01:13:39,049
Don’t finish.

930
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,246
We have to tell two kinds
of violence apart,

931
01:13:44,331 --> 01:13:47,391
a somewhat more subtle violence,
which Marilena Chauí

932
01:13:47,476 --> 01:13:49,293
calls “perfect violence”,

933
01:13:49,511 --> 01:13:52,895
which many people will
not see as violence,

934
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:57,131
because it’s so well-constructed,
so normalized,

935
01:13:57,289 --> 01:14:01,636
that it’s wearing “protection”
or “care” make-up.

936
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:04,789
“Look, I’ll just do a little cut,
just a little snip.”

937
01:14:05,058 --> 01:14:09,273
The vast majority of obstetric
violence is perfect violence.

938
01:14:09,606 --> 01:14:12,558
The first delivery
was very traumatic for me.

939
01:14:12,643 --> 01:14:15,129
I became a statistic for
unnecessary C-section.

940
01:14:15,246 --> 01:14:18,577
I got pregnant with my second
daughter and I knew right then

941
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,828
that I wanted a different birth.

942
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:22,552
Nothing better than Sofia, right?

943
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:39,412
We perform 1,000 births
a month on average,

944
01:14:39,777 --> 01:14:44,640
and the C-section rate is about 25%.

945
01:14:44,833 --> 01:14:47,200
Everyone, the board
of directors, all workers

946
01:14:47,284 --> 01:14:49,932
know the public health system’s
principles by heart.

947
01:14:50,938 --> 01:14:52,749
If all hospitals in this country

948
01:14:52,834 --> 01:14:55,280
could know such principles,
we could say that every hospital

949
01:14:55,365 --> 01:14:57,406
in the public health system works,
despite all the hardships they face.

950
01:14:57,491 --> 01:15:00,181
Many people say,
“But that’s a structural issue,

951
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:02,594
what can I do?
I’m overcrowded as it is.

952
01:15:02,746 --> 01:15:05,630
I lack resources.” Actually,

953
01:15:05,715 --> 01:15:07,657
that’s the least important thing
where humanization is concerned.

954
01:15:07,742 --> 01:15:11,270
The most important thing is changing
every staff member internally.

955
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:13,409
Who wants a C-section?
The C-section is to blame,

956
01:15:13,494 --> 01:15:15,467
because it gets chosen.
Because pregnant women

957
01:15:15,574 --> 01:15:17,534
who want a C-section, they choose it,

958
01:15:17,619 --> 01:15:19,290
they ask for it, they can’t face the pain,

959
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:20,901
they think they won’t be able to.

960
01:15:21,437 --> 01:15:26,040
It’s the OBGYN’s job to activate their
in-ear Babelfish, and when she says,

961
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:28,388
“I want a C-section”, they
should hear, “I want help”.

962
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:33,325
We’ve got auriculotherapy, ventouse,

963
01:15:33,410 --> 01:15:37,667
acupuncture, homeopathy, floral
and aromatherapy techniques.

964
01:15:37,752 --> 01:15:40,501
The basis, the common core is
traditional Chinese medicine.

965
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:43,581
It’s a new regard for health care.

966
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:48,882
Peaceful mom, peaceful
baby, peaceful delivery.

967
01:15:49,094 --> 01:15:50,883
It’s about loving what you do.

968
01:15:50,973 --> 01:15:54,918
Sometimes a woman is there,
suffering, because she’s alone.

969
01:15:55,057 --> 01:15:58,471
If you go and hold her hand,
look her in the eyes,

970
01:15:59,303 --> 01:16:02,851
that’s enough. Just that’ll
do a world of difference.

971
01:16:06,754 --> 01:16:08,767
And the public health system
is an option for that,

972
01:16:08,852 --> 01:16:13,225
so you have staff who are there,
and if they’re properly trained,

973
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:16,914
it won’t make much difference
if you get staff A, B or C.

974
01:16:18,041 --> 01:16:21,319
Two fillings. Delicious!

975
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:25,078
-Wow, she’s devouring it!
-I am not!

976
01:16:25,516 --> 01:16:27,266
Put it in your mouth!
Put it in your mouth!

977
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:42,902
It’s gonna be all right.
Everything fine so far?

978
01:16:43,123 --> 01:16:47,744
-It’s just anxiety.
-But you get that, you can’t help it.

979
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:50,502
-Anxiety to see his little face.
-How many months are you?

980
01:16:50,629 --> 01:16:54,315
-I’m in the 34th week.
-Almost seven months.

981
01:16:55,235 --> 01:16:58,425
I won’t hold it together.
I’m gonna scream.

982
01:16:59,031 --> 01:17:00,887
<i>How are we gonna renounce to that?</i>

983
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:03,814
<i>What are we gonna renounce to</i>
<i>in the public health system?</i>

984
01:17:04,095 --> 01:17:06,316
To defend women’s rights?

985
01:17:06,552 --> 01:17:08,878
To proper treatment during childbirth?

986
01:17:09,576 --> 01:17:14,783
To the right of children to be
born with decent treatment?

987
01:17:14,874 --> 01:17:19,477
<i>We have a natural birth center,</i>
<i>100% public health system,</i>

988
01:17:19,746 --> 01:17:23,376
<i>São Sebastião Birth House,</i>
<i>in the Federal District.</i>

989
01:17:23,461 --> 01:17:26,990
It’s a small space,
as cozy as possible.

990
01:17:27,091 --> 01:17:31,848
We have a whole structure to allow
women to have their babies safely.

991
01:17:32,029 --> 01:17:34,763
We want this public health system to work,

992
01:17:34,931 --> 01:17:37,897
that it can happen to all women.

993
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:44,361
I’m explaining to this gentleman
since the time he got here,

994
01:17:44,475 --> 01:17:47,977
and his wife’s had her baby,
actually, she’s lying in there

995
01:17:48,062 --> 01:17:50,283
calmly, beautifully fulfilling
her role as a mother,

996
01:17:50,445 --> 01:17:53,221
and you are pestering me
ever since you got here.

997
01:17:53,306 --> 01:17:56,490
You wanna go in?
You may go in.

998
01:17:56,575 --> 01:18:02,776
To me, it’s indifferent if you
watch the delivery or not.

999
01:18:02,861 --> 01:18:07,574
It’s the law.
Okay, then, here, take your nice law,

1000
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:10,847
fold it and tuck it somewhere.
Do you want to go in?

1001
01:18:16,797 --> 01:18:19,871
I was begging for anesthesia,

1002
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:23,922
they gave me at the end, and I
didn’t feel my daughter being born.

1003
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:29,088
They tore her from me, they took her away,

1004
01:18:31,784 --> 01:18:37,783
I think I was separated
from her for three hours.

1005
01:18:38,566 --> 01:18:42,563
Black women suffer much
worse verbal insults,

1006
01:18:42,648 --> 01:18:46,995
Kristeller maneuvers,
unnecessary touch exams.

1007
01:18:47,132 --> 01:18:50,086
Black women are those who
get the least anesthetics,

1008
01:18:50,444 --> 01:18:54,012
they get the least information, and
when they go to a public hospital,

1009
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:57,016
they’re gonna hear:
“Oh, you have large hips.”

1010
01:18:57,137 --> 01:19:00,744
“You’re a good breeder.”
“You can stand the pain better.”

1011
01:19:01,964 --> 01:19:04,613
Come on, kid!

1012
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,350
Thank God, everything’s fine.

1013
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:11,946
Stop the drip.
Stop the drip.

1014
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:15,457
Beautiful!

1015
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:18,675
Rest, Mom, rest.

1016
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:22,458
Crying nicely!

1017
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:27,304
Naming helps us to remove

1018
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:29,602
the invisibility cloak that
covers this phenomenon.

1019
01:19:29,713 --> 01:19:35,295
<i>Research shows: Native Brazilian</i>
<i>women suffer less interventions,</i>

1020
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:39,979
<i>they get less food, because there’s</i>
<i>this idea that she’s an animal</i>

1021
01:19:40,064 --> 01:19:42,615
<i>and she knows how to have her</i>
<i>baby crouching. So, if she needs</i>

1022
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,197
<i>an emergency C-section,</i>
<i>she won’t have access to it.</i>

1023
01:19:46,324 --> 01:19:49,883
These are women whose cultural
values aren’t being respected.

1024
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:53,325
These multi-ethnical strata in Brazil,

1025
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:56,235
they’re being completely neglected.

1026
01:20:30,065 --> 01:20:32,749
We’re not lunatics or mystics,

1027
01:20:32,912 --> 01:20:35,985
it’s the scientists who agree
with all that, actually.

1028
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:37,982
Belo Horizonte’s Perinatal Committee

1029
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,783
works with all sorts of partners.

1030
01:20:39,894 --> 01:20:43,156
We gather everyone together,
including the private sector,

1031
01:20:43,241 --> 01:20:47,412
Sanitary Vigilance,
law councils, health councils,

1032
01:20:47,517 --> 01:20:51,143
women’s representatives, Bem Nascer.

1033
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:56,696
<i>A broad invitation and a regular,</i>
<i>representative, diverse agenda</i>

1034
01:20:57,142 --> 01:21:01,025
<i>to build a new differential,</i>
<i>a new paradigm.</i>

1035
01:21:01,433 --> 01:21:03,764
<i>And Sofia helps a lot with that.</i>

1036
01:21:03,861 --> 01:21:07,376
One of the main safeguards
Brazilians have today

1037
01:21:07,884 --> 01:21:09,514
of their citizenship
is the public health system.

1038
01:21:09,599 --> 01:21:11,345
This is why we have to
struggle with all our strength

1039
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:13,175
to avoid its elimination.

1040
01:21:13,672 --> 01:21:15,959
I think the Brazilian
people still have no idea

1041
01:21:16,044 --> 01:21:18,121
of what living without a
public health system is.

1042
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,083
Three unnecessary C-sections.

1043
01:21:25,168 --> 01:21:28,238
It’s my body.
I was cut up three times

1044
01:21:28,393 --> 01:21:31,634
and I didn’t want to.
Three times.

1045
01:21:38,243 --> 01:21:40,350
<i>I have a documentary crew here…</i>

1046
01:21:49,073 --> 01:21:52,516
-Make him be okay!
-He's great!

1047
01:21:52,601 --> 01:21:53,678
My love!

1048
01:21:55,273 --> 01:21:56,449
My love!

1049
01:21:58,415 --> 01:22:00,288
Love of my life!

1050
01:22:26,543 --> 01:22:30,168
The term appeared in Brazil,
“humanization”.

1051
01:22:30,253 --> 01:22:34,778
There was much resistance because
of that name, “humanized”.

1052
01:22:35,008 --> 01:22:37,994
The doctors who didn’t understand
this kind of care would say,

1053
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:41,423
“But I am human, I treat women,

1054
01:22:41,508 --> 01:22:44,368
I don’t treat cows and bitches.”

1055
01:22:44,453 --> 01:22:47,292
I prefer the term “humanist assistance”,

1056
01:22:47,477 --> 01:22:50,613
which covers all areas,
not only obstetric assistance.

1057
01:22:51,094 --> 01:22:53,198
Health assistance in general.

1058
01:22:56,016 --> 01:23:01,023
<i>Ben, you came at a good time to see</i>

1059
01:23:02,414 --> 01:23:04,847
<i>The world spinning fast</i>

1060
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:09,810
<i>And life running too far</i>

1061
01:23:13,817 --> 01:23:18,529
<i>Ben, I heard that you wanted to talk</i>

1062
01:23:20,055 --> 01:23:23,711
<i>Your mom told me you’re something else</i>

1063
01:23:24,638 --> 01:23:27,961
<i>And looking at your pictures, I miss you</i>

1064
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:36,364
<i>Ben, one day you’ll grow up</i>

1065
01:23:37,782 --> 01:23:40,644
<i>You’ll get tired of toys and playing</i>

1066
01:23:42,179 --> 01:23:45,751
<i>You’ll come back with</i>
<i>sadness under your arm</i>

1067
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:50,814
<i>Because teeth decay</i>

1068
01:23:50,953 --> 01:23:54,905
<i>And legs grow too long</i>

1069
01:23:56,443 --> 01:23:58,497
<i>Ghosts fly</i>

1070
01:23:58,637 --> 01:24:02,053
<i>After the light dissolves</i>

1071
01:24:03,702 --> 01:24:06,237
<i>But that’s no mystery</i>

1072
01:24:07,883 --> 01:24:10,429
<i>No need to cry</i>

1073
01:24:13,577 --> 01:24:18,615
<i>Ben, never stop listening</i>
<i>to the records I gave you</i>

1074
01:24:19,747 --> 01:24:22,752
<i>Never miss a nice day at the beach</i>

1075
01:24:23,985 --> 01:24:28,170
<i>Don’t forget to come visit me, you rascal</i>

1076
01:24:30,575 --> 01:24:35,122
<i>Ben, don’t listen to what they’ll say</i>

1077
01:24:36,759 --> 01:24:39,677
<i>And don’t hear too many advice</i>

1078
01:24:40,977 --> 01:24:44,429
<i>Not even this nonsense I’m telling you now</i>

1079
01:24:47,336 --> 01:24:49,075
<i>That teeth decay</i>

1080
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:52,858
<i>And legs grow too long</i>

1081
01:24:55,778 --> 01:24:57,656
<i>Ghosts fly</i>

1082
01:24:57,856 --> 01:25:01,241
<i>After the light dissolves</i>

1083
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:06,051
<i>People scream</i>

1084
01:25:06,136 --> 01:25:09,328
<i>People talk too much</i>

1085
01:25:10,914 --> 01:25:13,508
<i>But that’s no mystery</i>

1086
01:25:15,129 --> 01:25:17,954
<i>No need to cry</i>

1087
01:25:20,929 --> 01:25:22,755
<i>Life is good</i>

1088
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:26,422
<i>When you play too much</i>

1089
01:25:29,345 --> 01:25:31,139
<i>When you sing</i>

1090
01:25:31,444 --> 01:25:35,105
<i>And you don’t look back</i>

1091
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,954
<i>Just don’t forget</i>

1092
01:25:40,453 --> 01:25:44,973
<i>That I’m your buddy and I know more</i>

1093
01:26:08,325 --> 01:26:10,869
This pain is impossible to explain.

1094
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:14,568
No matter how much you study,
you read, it’s no use,

1095
01:26:14,653 --> 01:26:18,077
you have to live it
to know what it’s like, see?

1096
01:26:25,483 --> 01:26:28,301
I thought I was so though,
a Marathon runner.

1097
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:51,561
He’s born!

1098
01:26:51,646 --> 01:26:56,356
My love! My love, beautiful!

1099
01:26:58,471 --> 01:27:01,823
You’re drowning, love?
Please don’t drown.
