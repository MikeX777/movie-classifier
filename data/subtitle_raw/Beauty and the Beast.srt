[NARRATOR READING]

2
00:02:15,004 --> 00:02:17,441
I remember this place.

3
00:02:17,485 --> 00:02:21,097
Eduardo and I came
riding here the day
before I left for home.

4
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:25,797
Three months ago.
It seems like
countless ages.

5
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:29,584
I hope you realize
you're a very fortunate
young lady.

6
00:02:29,627 --> 00:02:31,890
Usually a marriage between
families such as ours

7
00:02:31,934 --> 00:02:35,851
is hardly more than
a matter of convenience,
not an affair of the heart.

8
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,854
You don't know
how grateful I am that
you gave me the opportunity

9
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,509
to know him completely
before we were
formally betrothed.

10
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,426
You might pretend
to show just
a little sorrow

11
00:02:45,469 --> 00:02:49,908
at the thought of leaving
your father to enter
into a new land, a new life.

12
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:55,523
I'm sorry to be so selfish,
but all I can
think of is Eduardo.

13
00:02:55,566 --> 00:02:58,265
And in just a little while,
I'll see him again.

14
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,485
Silvio.

15
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,530
Yes, Your Excellency?

16
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,706
Tell him to stir up
the horses, man.

17
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:07,709
At this rate, we won't
reach Castle Alleta
until after dark.

18
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:09,276
Yes, My Lord.

19
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:11,408
Stir them up.[SHOUTS]

20
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:19,808
NARRATOR:  For generations 
the Castle Alleta had stood 
as a symbol of authority

21
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:25,248
in the land where the young 
Duke Eduardo had recently 
come to the throne.

22
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:28,860
But now, Eduardo's subjects 
were beginning 
to become uneasy,

23
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:32,821
for there were things 
happening in the castle which 
they could not understand.

24
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:40,220
Their Highnesses
Prince Bruno
and Princess Sybil.

25
00:03:45,486 --> 00:03:49,490
I'm sure, Eduardo,
if your uncle deigns
to pay us a visit,

26
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,406
he either brings bad news,
or hopes to find it here.

27
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:06,768
I trust that you are well,
dear nephew.

28
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:09,336
Why this air
of solicitude?

29
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:14,341
Well, there are rumors that
Your Grace might not be
enjoying the best of health.

30
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:17,605
I hope you're not disappointed
to find the rumors unfounded.

31
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:21,391
Your Grace, you do
us an injustice.

32
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,741
Then illness is not the reason
why Your Grace cancelled

33
00:04:23,785 --> 00:04:25,265
the Fiesta of the
Throne of Alleta?

34
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:31,271
His Grace has cancelled it
on the grounds of economy.

35
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:34,796
I doubt His Grace's people
will be happy with
such an explanation.

36
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,798
It is I who must answer
to the people.

37
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,106
You will not reconsider?

38
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,109
Uh, the people certainly
will not object
to the expense.

39
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:45,981
EDUARDO: No.

40
00:04:48,636 --> 00:04:51,508
Well, it is on your head
and not on mine.

41
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:54,294
Then this is the first time
you have expressed
satisfaction at not being

42
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,295
in my place.

43
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,950
Then, with Your Grace's
permission,

44
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:01,605
we will relieve you
of our very unwelcome
presence here.

45
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,955
You have it.Your Grace.

46
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:12,747
You were right,
they came here hoping
to find bad news.

47
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,534
Perhaps Grimaldi's
report was wrong.
Eduardo seemed all right.

48
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:20,450
Not to me. He's hiding
something. I could see
it in his eyes.

49
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,757
I'll send him back here,
let him sniff around
again.

50
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,542
We'll need more than rumors
to hold over His Grace's
head.

51
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,030
NARRATOR:  The suspicions 
of Prince Bruno were not 
without foundation,

52
00:05:35,073 --> 00:05:38,860
for Alleta was 
ruled by Eduardo, 
only by day.

53
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:41,950
When the sun would 
sink beyond the 
distant horizon,

54
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:47,521
Eduardo compelled everyone, 
except his Chancellor Orsini, 
to leave the castle.

55
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:12,415
As night shadows began 
to engulf the land,

56
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,070
Eduardo and Orsini 
began their lonely vigil.

57
00:06:21,511 --> 00:06:26,429
Eduardo's subjects could not 
be told that the young duke 
was living two lives,

58
00:06:26,473 --> 00:06:31,695
and that by day 
he had to hide the torment 
that gripped his soul.

59
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:36,308
For no one could know of 
the evil curse that overtook 
him when darkness fell,

60
00:06:36,352 --> 00:06:39,224
a curse that only 
he and Orsini must face.

61
00:06:42,445 --> 00:06:46,623
Eduardo, you are
inflicting added suffering
upon yourself.

62
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,191
You would be
safe enough locked
within your own door.

63
00:06:49,234 --> 00:06:55,284
No, Orsini. How do I know
what might come over
me when it is upon me?

64
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:09,907
Perhaps I should
have you chain me
to the wall.

65
00:07:09,951 --> 00:07:11,561
You've never been violent.

66
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,174
I guess I should be
grateful for that blessing.

67
00:07:22,224 --> 00:07:29,100
Orsini, what if I should
become a thing,
a thing of pure evil?

68
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,320
ORSINI: I dare not
even think of it.

69
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:38,458
To know that I have
to subject you to this every
night, it is enough.

70
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:46,466
The sun...
It's gone.

71
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:56,040
I can feel it coming.

72
00:07:58,129 --> 00:07:59,827
I want to fight it.

73
00:08:02,743 --> 00:08:06,007
How do you
defeat an enemy
you can't see?

74
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:09,549
Strange, you'd think
the place deserted,
and it isn't that late.

75
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:20,821
I didn't notice a guard
at the gates.
Did you, Silvio?

76
00:09:20,864 --> 00:09:22,605
There was none,
My Lord.

77
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,652
In fact, there doesn't
seem to be a soul
about the whole place.

78
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:28,306
Well, wake them up.
Let them know we're here.

79
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,786
Yes, My Lord.

80
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:39,753
This is not exactly
the warm welcome
I pictured in my mind.

81
00:09:40,318 --> 00:09:42,407
Nor I.

82
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,410
Of course, Eduardo
had no reason to
expect us so soon.

83
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:54,594
NARRATOR:  On the shoulders 
of Orsini had fallen the sad 
and difficult task

84
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:59,511
of keeping Eduardo's secret 
from the world, no matter 
what excuses he had to give,

85
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:02,297
or what falsehoods 
he had to conceal.

86
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,136
Someone is coming,
My Lord.

87
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:26,495
If you have business
with His Grace, return
after sunrise in the morning.

88
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:29,759
You're talking to
His Excellency,
the Count of Sardi.

89
00:10:31,413 --> 00:10:35,635
Count Roderick?Yes, Orsini. Count Roderick.
And the Lady Althea.

90
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:38,812
Good heavens, man, are you
going to keep us standing out
here the rest of the night?

91
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,988
A thousand pardons,
My Lord.

92
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,213
If our arrival is an
inconvenience, perhaps we
should seek shelter elsewhere?

93
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,954
Forgive me,
Your Excellency.

94
00:10:50,998 --> 00:10:54,479
Come. Silvio,
bring in the luggage.Yes, My Lord.

95
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:57,265
It's good to see you again,
Baron Orsini.

96
00:10:57,308 --> 00:11:02,052
And you, My Lady.
And more beautiful
than ever.

97
00:11:02,096 --> 00:11:06,535
You will forgive me
if I seem a trifle startled
at your arrival tonight.

98
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:10,495
Is it a state of crisis
that we arrived a few days
earlier than planned?

99
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,761
No. When did Your
Excellency leave Sardi?

100
00:11:15,457 --> 00:11:17,633
A week ago.

101
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:22,551
Then the courier from
His Grace did not reach you?

102
00:11:22,594 --> 00:11:25,902
With a personal message
from Duke Eduardo?

103
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:28,165
Concerning what?

104
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:33,127
My Lord, I would not
presume to discuss
His Grace's personal affairs.

105
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,998
Spoken like a true diplomat.

106
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:38,349
Well, we are here,
Orsini, take us to Eduardo.

107
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:41,918
He can tell us the
import of his message.

108
00:11:41,962 --> 00:11:46,880
I'm sure he will see you
and the Lady Althea the
first thing in the morning.

109
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,969
We won't see him tonight?

110
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:50,579
I'm afraid not.

111
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,322
His Grace is indisposed.

112
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,064
Ill?

113
00:11:57,107 --> 00:12:01,285
Oh, probably one too many
farewell bachelor dinners,
eh, Orsini?

114
00:12:01,329 --> 00:12:03,635
Huh? Well,
I'm ready
for bed myself.

115
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,289
Come along with the luggage.

116
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,554
If your servants will just
leave the luggage here,

117
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:12,775
I will see that it is
delivered to your rooms.

118
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,822
Oh, very well.
That'll be all, Silvio.

119
00:12:15,865 --> 00:12:17,737
See to
the horses, huh?Yes, My Lord.

120
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:48,376
Please stay closely,
My Lord.

121
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,639
Because of the darkness.

122
00:12:57,428 --> 00:13:01,824
Well, I must say our meal
was more refreshing than
our reception here tonight.

123
00:13:03,652 --> 00:13:07,787
You know, this
is the first time I've ever
had my food served

124
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,528
by the chancellor
of a duchy.

125
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:14,881
I'm sure Eduardo will
have a perfectly reasonable
explanation.

126
00:13:14,924 --> 00:13:20,669
The entire place in darkness.
No servants about.

127
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:27,894
Locked doors,
no guard at the gates.

128
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,508
Eduardo's explanation
will have to be
more than reasonable.

129
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:38,208
Father, when you asked
why Eduardo didn't meet
us this evening,

130
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:43,126
it was you who
offered an excuse,
not Orsini.

131
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:46,782
Well, now. Bride-grooms-to-be
do have their farewell
bachelor dinners, you know.

132
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:52,135
Everything always
looks worse when
you're tired.

133
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:57,314
I'm sure Eduardo will have
your perfectly reasonable
explanation in the morning.

134
00:13:57,358 --> 00:14:00,578
Good night, my dear.
Sleep well.

135
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:02,798
Good night.

136
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:18,118
[LATCH RATTLING]

137
00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:10,561
NARRATOR:  In the morning, 
when the sun warmed 
the countryside once again,

138
00:15:10,605 --> 00:15:13,434
and the nightmares 
of darkness were gone,

139
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:17,568
the young duke returned 
to his duties as 
ruler of the land.

140
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:24,619
And then, my neighbor, this
jackass, let his cow stray
into my vegetable patch.

141
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:28,405
Each of my wonderful
vegetables has been raised
by the sweat of my brow,

142
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:33,323
And that... That stupid fool
of a cow ate a whole row
of my very best carrots.

143
00:15:35,456 --> 00:15:41,592
Therefore, I claim
the right to hold his cow
in payment for damages.

144
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:44,769
And how many of this man's
fine carrots did your cow eat?

145
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:49,600
It couldn't be many,
Your Grace. She has such
a delicate appetite.

146
00:15:49,644 --> 00:15:53,082
Well, then, it is my
judgment that you
return to Benito his cow.

147
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:55,780
BENITO: Thank you, Your Grace.
Thank you.

148
00:15:55,824 --> 00:15:59,871
But you must give to Pasquale
his damages, all the milk
your cow produces today,

149
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:02,700
because it was made
from his carrots.

150
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:03,963
PASQUALE: Thank you,
Your Grace.

151
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:07,488
You have my leave to go.

152
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:26,202
You seem to have lost
your uneasiness of last
night very quickly.

153
00:16:26,246 --> 00:16:28,639
It seems so silly now that
I should have been disturbed.

154
00:16:28,683 --> 00:16:31,816
Sometimes that imagination of
yours is a little too vivid.

155
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,515
You weren't so easy
in your own mind.Oh.

156
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,568
Eduardo!I see you, and I forget
all the words I rehearsed

157
00:16:44,612 --> 00:16:47,484
to welcome you home.

158
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:51,140
Perhaps you might remember
with a little prompting.

159
00:16:51,184 --> 00:16:54,361
They were meant to be
spoken in the special garden.

160
00:16:54,404 --> 00:16:56,798
I seem to remember
such a garden.

161
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:01,977
Do you mind,

listening to stories
about hobgoblins.

327
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:50,403
I don't believe
in things supernatural.

328
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:54,450
You would, if you'd
been at that castle for
the past three months.

329
00:32:54,494 --> 00:32:57,627
I tell you again,
what all of us know,

330
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,673
there is evil inside it.

331
00:33:11,337 --> 00:33:14,122
So I spent a ducat
of Your Highness' money

332
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:17,778
on a few liters of wine
at the inn frequented
by the castle servants.

333
00:33:17,821 --> 00:33:20,476
An investment
in loosened tongues.

334
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,654
Well spent, I hope.
At times you're a little
free with my money.

335
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:26,395
Go on, go on,
Grimaldi.

336
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:29,268
Well, I trust that
what I learned was worth
more than a ducat.

337
00:33:29,311 --> 00:33:31,357
Come to the point,
man.

338
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,882
What do the servants think
takes place inside the castle
during the dark hours?

339
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:38,538
One of them, a laundress,
dared to whisper that
she believes His Grace

340
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:44,761
has allied himself
with Satan and celebrates
the Black Mass.

341
00:33:44,805 --> 00:33:48,722
With that holier-than-thou
Orsini acting as his
altar boy?

342
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:50,289
It's ridiculous.

343
00:33:50,332 --> 00:33:53,161
It may not be as ridiculous
as you think, Your Highness.

344
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:56,773
A hostler, with quarters
close to the castle,
fled to the inn last night

345
00:33:56,817 --> 00:34:01,213
with a story of having
heard a woman's screams
from inside the castle.

346
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:03,824
Horrible shrieks
he called them,

347
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,870
and he was frightened
out of his wits.

348
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:08,742
But if you are
to be believed,

349
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:13,051
the only woman who could
be in the castle is the...
The Lady Althea.

350
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:16,097
Exactly so.

351
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,795
And why should
she scream horribly?

352
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:24,975
Now, what I've heard
may be no more than
old wives' tales,

353
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:27,195
but this I can assure
Your Highnesses,

354
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,155
the servants are in
a state of nerves
and dread.

355
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:32,331
And ready
to believe anything.

356
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:36,422
Grimaldi, could you
arrange it for me to

357
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,381
get into the castle
secretly at night?

358
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:42,689
I seem to have anticipated
Your Highness' thoughts.

359
00:34:44,517 --> 00:34:47,476
The key to the courtyard
entrance to the wine cellar.

360
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,090
I, uh, borrowed it from
His Grace's wine steward
while we were singing,

361
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:54,396
locked in brotherly embrace.[CHUCKLES]

362
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,182
But he will miss it.
He'll report it lost.

363
00:34:57,225 --> 00:35:00,924
Your Highness'
have a tendency
to underestimate me.

364
00:35:00,968 --> 00:35:04,711
This is a duplicate
I contrived in the early
hours of this morning.

365
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:07,192
The wine steward's key
will be found on the floor

366
00:35:07,235 --> 00:35:09,107
of the inn where
he will think
he dropped it.

367
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,804
Good man.

368
00:35:10,847 --> 00:35:13,111
Your Highness flatters
my small talents.

369
00:35:14,286 --> 00:35:16,114
Tonight, Your Highness?

370
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,245
Tonight.

371
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:26,167
You know now why I sent
a courier to Your Excellency,
with a contrived excuse,

372
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,735
in the hope of
delaying your coming.

373
00:35:30,215 --> 00:35:33,218
But when you arrived,
I... I lacked the courage

374
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:34,828
to tell you of this horror.

375
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,136
I should never have
permitted you to enter,

376
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:39,354
no matter what the cost.

377
00:35:42,357 --> 00:35:45,360
It's better that
I know the truth.

378
00:35:45,404 --> 00:35:49,538
You say you're aware
of the nature of this
monstrous thing?

379
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:51,323
It is written
in the record
of judgments

380
00:35:51,366 --> 00:35:55,544
pronounced
by Duke Francisco
while he reigned.

381
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:59,200
I need not recall
to you the character
of Eduardo's father.

382
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:04,031
He was not
a bad man in the
true sense of the word.

383
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:07,513
But he was harsh,
imperious, exacting.

384
00:36:07,556 --> 00:36:10,080
He believed in his
divine right to rule,

385
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:12,692
and that all living things
in this domain,

386
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,955
together with
the product of their labor,

387
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:17,827
even their thoughts,
belonged to him.

388
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:20,221
Far different
from Eduardo's
way of thinking,

389
00:36:22,397 --> 00:36:24,573
perhaps because I had
some small part

390
00:36:24,617 --> 00:36:27,315
in forming Eduardo's
more liberal concepts
from his earliest years.

391
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,621
Orsini, please.

392
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,362
The explanation.

393
00:36:31,232 --> 00:36:33,147
[SIGHS]

394
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,323
It was reported
to the Duke

395
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:38,326
that the alchemist-sorcerer
Scarlotti

396
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,678
had discovered a way
of transmuting base metals
into pure gold.

397
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,855
The Duke ordered
the man brought
before him and demanded

398
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,857
that he reveal the secret.

399
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,903
Scarlotti refused,

400
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:53,515
saying that the knowledge
was not meant for the
enrichment of any one man,

401
00:36:54,516 --> 00:36:57,171
but belonged to all men.

402
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,740
The Duke, in a rage,
threatened Scarlotti
with the rack,

403
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,308
to torture
the secret from him.

404
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:06,354
Scarlotti had
no fear of torture.

405
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:08,835
And, in the end,
the Duke commanded that he be

406
00:37:09,575 --> 00:37:11,098
entombed alive

407
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:13,448
for his defiance.

408
00:37:16,408 --> 00:37:18,801
I can still see
his burning eyes,

409
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,372
hear his voice as
he spoke to the Duke
before he was taken away.

410
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:30,857
"Because power and greed
have made a beast
of the Duke of Alleta,

411
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,251
"I lay a curse
upon his house.

412
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:38,473
"For he who shall
follow you upon this throne,

413
00:37:38,517 --> 00:37:41,955
"shall prowl by night

the shape of a beast."

414
00:37:50,093 --> 00:37:51,747
And he was
entombed alive?

415
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:55,098
Yes,

416
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:58,450
and because I protested,
secretly from me.

417
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:01,322
Probably in some remote
dungeon within these walls.

418
00:38:02,845 --> 00:38:05,108
He was never
seen alive again.

419
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,763
And the masons
who walled him in were
sent out of the country.

420
00:38:09,461 --> 00:38:12,507
The secret of his end
died with Duke Francisco.

421
00:38:14,335 --> 00:38:16,294
I will not believe
there's nothing you can do,

422
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:17,817
that there's no answer.

423
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,471
Nor will I.

424
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:21,124
For having seen him,
I cannot think

425
00:38:21,168 --> 00:38:25,259
of the sorcerer
as a completely evil man.

426
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,957
He may have relented
and in his tomb

427
00:38:28,001 --> 00:38:30,482
left some clue as to
the removal of the curse.

428
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:34,834
But we've not been
able to find a trace of it.

429
00:38:44,017 --> 00:38:45,410
Go back to Sardi.

430

Even with the whole
world between us?

433
00:38:57,857 --> 00:39:00,033

for you to forget me?

to know whether
you would recover,

00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:29,639
What you thought
you saw came from
the bottom of a glass.

496
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:32,773
On the contrary, my dear.

497
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,775
If my memory
serves me right,

498
00:45:34,819 --> 00:45:37,038
it came from the
very imaginative art
of a man I once knew...

499
00:45:37,082 --> 00:45:38,431
Scarlotti.

500
00:45:39,084 --> 00:45:40,259
And his black art.

501
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:42,609
You talk in riddles.

502
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:47,962
You've heard the
old wives' tale concerning
Scarlotti, the sorcerer?

503
00:45:48,006 --> 00:45:50,399
Of course.
Ever since I was a child.

504
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:54,273
I'm beginning to think
the tale possesses more
truth than fiction.

505
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:59,582
You actually believe
the curse Scarlotti put
on the Duke Francisco?

506
00:45:59,626 --> 00:46:02,760
"He who shall follow
after you upon this throne

507
00:46:03,673 --> 00:46:06,285
"shall prowl by night

508
00:46:07,634 --> 00:46:09,418
"in the manner and in
the shape of a beast."

509
00:46:09,462 --> 00:46:12,073
He looked exactly that,
a beast.

510
00:46:12,117 --> 00:46:15,250
And when did these
mysterious nighttime closings
of the castle begin?

511
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:18,036
Immediately after
the coronation of
Duke Eduardo.

512
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,951
Almost to the day.

513
00:46:21,604 --> 00:46:23,258
Well, perhaps your
more enlightened mind

514
00:46:23,302 --> 00:46:25,739
can think of some
other explanation for
what has been happening,

515
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,654
for what we have seen.

516
00:46:28,176 --> 00:46:29,612
No.

517
00:46:29,656 --> 00:46:31,527
To think that from his tomb,

518
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:33,442
Scarlotti has
given me the weapon
that I have needed

519
00:46:33,486 --> 00:46:35,314
to rid myself of Eduardo.

520
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:37,707
Hail,
Duke of Alleta!

521
00:46:37,751 --> 00:46:40,058
Oh, you can't.
The curse might fall upon you.

522
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:42,495
Listen to Scarlotti's
words again.

523
00:46:42,538 --> 00:46:45,237
"He who shall
follow after you
upon this throne."

524
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,630
Eduardo followed
after Francisco, not I.

525
00:46:47,674 --> 00:46:50,329
The curse was
meant for him.
None other.

526
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,946

Prince Bruno
and the Princess Sybil.

527
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:09,522

Your Excellency.

528
00:47:09,565 --> 00:47:11,872
My Lady Althea.

529
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:14,527
Perhaps Your Grace
misunderstood my message?

530
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:16,703
I requested
a private audience.

531
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:18,879
I have no secrets
from my fiancee,

532
00:47:18,923 --> 00:47:21,273
from her father,
nor from the Baron Orsini.

533
00:47:21,316 --> 00:47:25,886
I am a little surprised
to find the Lady Althea
still here.

534
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,888
I see no reason why
she should absent herself

535
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:30,064
a few days
before her wedding.

536
00:47:30,108 --> 00:47:32,458
I thought perhaps
the wedding might be canceled.

537
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:35,026
For the same reason
Your Grace canceled
the carnival.

538
00:47:35,069 --> 00:47:37,985
For which I am
now sure he had
a very good reason.

539
00:47:38,551 --> 00:47:40,074
You're wrong.

540
00:47:40,118 --> 00:47:42,511
My wedding to the Grace
will not be canceled,

541
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:45,210
nor postponed
for any reason.

542
00:47:46,907 --> 00:47:49,301
It would make a very
interesting union, indeed.

543
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,607
An unholy alliance.

544
00:47:51,651 --> 00:47:53,305
Ah, now do not pretend
offense, nephew.

545

Or that you are
unaware of my meaning.

546
00:47:55,089 --> 00:47:57,744
And what do you mean?

547
00:47:57,787 --> 00:47:59,877
Since I am the next in line,
I'm here to demand

548
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,705
His Grace's immediate
abdication in my favor.

549
00:48:02,749 --> 00:48:04,925
Or I will expose
his secret to the world.

550
00:48:04,969 --> 00:48:09,016
Why this castle is shrouded
in darkness and mystery
from sunset to sunrise.

551
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:11,497
Why His Grace has never
dared to show himself
during those hours

552
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:12,933
since the day
of his coronation.

553
00:48:12,977 --> 00:48:15,109
I will make public
what I know.

554
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:17,982
That the curse of Scarlotti
has fallen upon the son
of Duke Francisco

555
00:48:18,025 --> 00:48:19,984
and that a creature
out of the foul
depths of hell

556
00:48:20,027 --> 00:48:21,942
has succeeded to the throne.

557
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:23,770
You have no proof.

558
00:48:23,813 --> 00:48:26,686
You are the proof, Eduardo.
The living proof.

559
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:28,644
Do you dare put it
to the test?

560
00:48:28,688 --> 00:48:32,518
And if I needed more proof,
I see it written on her face.

561
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:35,390
And what do you see written
on my face, Your Highness?

562
00:48:35,434 --> 00:48:38,480
Except the desire to drive
the point of this sword
through your heart.

563
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:42,049
Why, I only wish to do
Your Excellency and the
Lady Althea a kindness.

564
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:43,833
And you, too, nephew.

565

By permitting you to
step aside quietly,

566
00:48:45,618 --> 00:48:48,055
without being driven out
by your own people.

567
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:50,057
As his trusted counselor,
Orsini, you should urge him

568
00:48:50,101 --> 00:48:52,451
to submit to something
that both of you
must've known

569
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,018
to be inevitable
from the beginning.

570
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:56,411
I do not know how
you arrived at the truth,

571
00:48:56,455 --> 00:48:59,501
but you will never
exploit it through me.

572
00:48:59,545 --> 00:49:02,417
You're fools, all of you,
to lend him false hope.

573
00:49:02,461 --> 00:49:04,724
When I come again,
it will not be in private.

574
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,032
And you will be glad
to flee this castle
like a slinking beast.

another curse upon my head

in violence!

to find Scarlotti's tomb 
began again.

unexplored regions

deep within the foundations 
of the castle,

583
00:49:44,851 --> 00:49:48,637
Eduardo and Orsini 
followed every possible clue,

00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,726
hoping to find evidence 
of the chamber

585
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:53,381
that had been sealed 
many years before.

586
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:00,040

there was faint hope.

beyond the wall,

I wanted to tear
the stones away
with my bare hands.

It must be Scarlotti.

but Scarlotti.

did leave them as a riddle

No, Highness.

01:09:33,386 --> 01:09:35,519
ALL: Yeah!

842
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:38,043
Then gather wood
to feed the flame.

843

[ALL CHEERING]

844
01:09:56,627 --> 01:09:58,411
MAN: The flame.ALL: Yeah.

845
01:09:59,107 --> 01:10:01,588
ALL: Burn! Burn!

846
01:10:13,252 --> 01:10:14,471
Let it be done.

847
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:19,563
Althea, go back.

848
01:10:19,606 --> 01:10:21,347
If she wants to
die with him,
let her.

849
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:23,567
The mark of the beast
is on her, too.

850
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:25,003
Put them both
in the torches.

851
01:10:27,701 --> 01:10:28,702
Wait!

852
01:10:31,749 --> 01:10:33,229
At least
listen to me.

853
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:38,843
If you believe
in his lies,

854
01:10:38,886 --> 01:10:41,715
you do murder for him.

855
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:44,892
But the evil
you should fear
is in his heart,

856
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:47,243
not in this man
he seeks to destroy.

857
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:52,770
What he told you
of the spell cast
over him was truth.

858
01:10:52,813 --> 01:10:55,120
He does not
deserve your hate,

859
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:57,253
but your prayers,
your compassion

860
01:10:57,296 --> 01:11:00,560
and your love
for all he has
suffered innocently.

861
01:11:00,604 --> 01:11:02,388
Love!

862
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:04,260
She asks us to love

863
01:11:04,869 --> 01:11:05,913
that.

[ALL LAUGHING]

865
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:13,878
Yes, love that,

866
01:11:13,921 --> 01:11:17,185
for an ugly face can
mask the goodness
hidden in one's soul.

867
01:11:20,972 --> 01:11:23,583
I know now
the meaning of the words

868
01:11:23,627 --> 01:11:26,238
I saw written
on the walls of
the sorcerer's tomb.

869
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:31,461
"Till out of love
with soul, fear free,

"a woman's hand
shall hold the key."

871
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:38,903
Scarlotti knew that...

872
01:11:38,946 --> 01:11:40,252
That unless
it's strong enough

873
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,819
to triumph over all else,

874
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:45,257
over fear, over pride,

875
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,041
even over death,

876
01:11:48,652 --> 01:11:51,394
love, even marriage,
are only empty words.

877
01:11:55,659 --> 01:11:57,182
If you burn him,

878
01:11:58,749 --> 01:12:00,664
then burn me with him.

879
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:04,363
Or I shall not live.

880
01:13:27,925 --> 01:13:29,274
Eduardo.

881
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:32,408
I feel it.

882
01:13:33,191 --> 01:13:34,584
Within me.

883
01:13:36,107 --> 01:13:37,108
That I am free.

884
01:13:44,724 --> 01:13:46,204
Deliverance.

885
01:13:46,247 --> 01:13:48,859
It is still night,
but the beast is gone.

886
01:13:52,776 --> 01:13:54,517
There is no escape
for you, Bruno.

887
01:13:55,822 --> 01:13:58,434
Here and now,
I banish you
from Alleta forever,

888
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:01,306
and Grimaldi with you.

889
01:14:13,013 --> 01:14:16,364
Yes, look at me.

890
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,194
See that I am Eduardo.

891
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:22,458
A man of flesh and blood.

892
01:14:22,501 --> 01:14:24,503
A man who has been
made whole again

893
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:26,331
through the love
of a woman.

894
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:29,334
This woman,

895
01:14:30,857 --> 01:14:32,250
who shall sit
by my side

896
01:14:32,293 --> 01:14:35,471
for as long
as I live and
rule over you,

897
01:14:35,514 --> 01:14:38,996
who will help me to be
worthy of your love,

898
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:42,347
and to govern with
justice and mercy
and understanding.

899
01:14:44,088 --> 01:14:45,481
Go in peace.

01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,486

night has ended.
