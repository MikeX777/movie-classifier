Crack an egg,
combine with sausage

with the genuine hospitality
of the place.

335
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:24,204
You're not my doctor.
Lily Perkins is my doctor.

336
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,106
This pie is for her.
It's her favorite.

337
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,475
Mermaid Marshmallow.

338
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:30,745
I am sorry to say
she's not seeing any patients.

339
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:32,880
She is semi-retired now.

340
00:18:32,981 --> 00:18:35,016
What?

341
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,952
Long story. Making it short.

342
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:39,654
I'm the junior doctor on staff.

343
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:41,756
I am from Connecticut.

344
00:18:41,856 --> 00:18:44,058
I just moved here two weeks ago.

345
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:46,226
-Are you bored yet?
-Yes. No.

346
00:18:46,326 --> 00:18:47,427
I'm so sorry. Anyway,
if you're not comfortable

347
00:18:47,528 --> 00:18:51,465
having me as your doctor...

348
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,368
that's fine.

349
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,203
My feelings will not be hurt.

350
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:59,206
You can just go

351
00:18:59,306 --> 00:19:00,908
and you can get yourself another
gynecologist in the area.

352
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:05,445
But Dr. Perkins delivered me.

353
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:09,316
She's been my doctor forever.
I really like and trust her.

354
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:16,189
Maybe you can really like
and trust me, too?

355
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,661
It doesn't happen that fast,

356
00:19:19,761 --> 00:19:21,062
but I'll try.

357
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,665
Okay. Okay, that's good.

358
00:19:23,765 --> 00:19:29,436
I'm your doctor.

359
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,674
-It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Bunterson.
-Hunterson.

360
00:19:32,774 --> 00:19:37,477
Hunterson.

361
00:19:37,578 --> 00:19:40,380
So what seems to be the problem?

362
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,684
-Well, I seem to be pregnant.
-Well, hey, that's good.

363
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:44,217
It's great. It's good for you.
Congratulations.

364
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:46,754
Thanks, but I don't want
this baby.

365
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:50,424
Okay. I can refer you
to a doctor who performs--

366
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,225
No, no, no. I'm keeping it.

367
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:54,595
Not that I judge that.

368
00:19:54,696 --> 00:19:57,832
I'm just telling you
I'm not so happy about it

369
00:19:57,932 --> 00:20:01,703
like everybody else might be,
so maybe you could be sensitive

370
00:20:01,803 --> 00:20:05,405
and not congratulate me
and make a big deal every time
you see me.

371
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:09,242
I'm having the baby,
that's that.

372
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:14,682
It's not a party, though.

373
00:20:14,782 --> 00:20:17,284
Not a party.

374
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,753
-[knock on door]
-Yes?

375
00:20:18,853 --> 00:20:20,454
Excuse me, Doctor.

376
00:20:20,555 --> 00:20:22,557
Mrs. Flannigan
wants to talk to you

377
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:24,759
about doulas before she leaves.

378
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,528
-Doulas?
-Mm-hmm.

379
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:30,297
Yeah, I have no idea
what that is.

380
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,399
No, come on. I'm only joking.

381
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:33,768
Of course I know what that is.

382
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:37,270
-Mm-hmm.
-[mouths]

383
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,908
And here are Mrs. Hunterson's
blood test results.

384
00:20:41,008 --> 00:20:47,014
Well...

385
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:51,018
un-congratulations.
You're definitely having a baby.

386
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,056
Well, un-thank you.

387
00:20:55,156 --> 00:20:58,425
Do you have any concerns?

388
00:20:58,526 --> 00:21:00,862
You know, do's and don'ts?

389
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:05,066
Exercise or sex?

390
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:09,103
Don't really do much of either.

391
00:21:09,203 --> 00:21:14,142
Okay. Here's your prescription
for your pre-natal vitamins.

392
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:16,544
Nurse Norma is just gonna
give you a list of the good
and the bad foods.

393
00:21:16,644 --> 00:21:18,179
That's just like caffeine
and alcohol and et cetera.

394
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,115
It's very nice--

395
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:26,988
[applause]

396
00:21:28,656 --> 00:21:31,559
it's very nice
meeting you, Jenna.

397
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:33,261
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna see you again,
you know,

398
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,830
in three weeks.

399
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,799
-I do have one question.
-Yeah. Yeah, shoot.

400
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:41,169
How pregnant am I?

401
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:45,773
Very.

402
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:47,642
I mean, there's really
only one degree of pregnancy,
so to speak.

403
00:21:47,742 --> 00:21:51,112
No, no. [laughs]

404
00:21:51,212 --> 00:21:56,416
I mean how far along? [laughs]

405
00:21:56,517 --> 00:21:59,620
You're eight weeks,
Give or take.

406
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,556
Okay, so I don't start showing
for a while, right?

407
00:22:01,656 --> 00:22:04,158
-Right.
-Good, then I have
a little time.

408
00:22:04,258 --> 00:22:06,727
Although it is quite
beautiful, you know,

409
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:12,533

-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

410
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:14,367
-Dr. Pomatter?
-Yeah?

411
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,304
I'm gonna give you this pie.

412
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,840
Oh, that looks
absolutely delicious.

413
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,474
I am off sugar

414
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:24,745
It actually causes
leptin resistance,

415
00:22:24,846 --> 00:22:27,315
chromium deficiency,
decreased longevity.

416
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:30,218
My mama used to say
you can live to be 100

417
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:33,955
if you give up all
the things that make you
want to live to be 100.

418
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:36,456
Well the longer
you're away from sugar
the less you crave it.

419
00:22:36,557 --> 00:22:37,925
I haven't had a piece of pie
in years.

420
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:44,232
Really?

421
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:49,003
Life's hard enough.

-[music ends]
-Listen, Cal,

426
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:51,299
we had ketchups out there
yesterday half-empty

427
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:53,567
and we all know,
the fuller the condiments,

428
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:56,704
the fuller the experience.

429
00:23:56,804 --> 00:23:59,807
I am so sorry. I'll make sure
it never happens again.

430
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:04,145
Thank you, Dawn.
I'll sleep tonight.

431
00:24:04,245 --> 00:24:05,780
-You're late.
-I'm sorry.

432
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,082
The bus driver was half asleep.

433
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:10,685
Why doesn't your damn husband
buy you a car already?

434
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:14,088
Because he doesn't want me
going nowhere.

435
00:24:14,188 --> 00:24:18,926
And you!

436
00:24:19,026 --> 00:24:21,494
Late again!

437
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:23,331
You're inches away
from being fired, lady.

438
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:26,067
Okay, then fire me.

439
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:30,104
Okay I will.

440
00:24:30,204 --> 00:24:33,407
Okay, then do!

443
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,424
So how was the doc?

444
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:53,160
Ugh, fine. It was fine.

445
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,429
New doctor. A man.

446
00:24:55,529 --> 00:24:58,165
A man? Wow. He single?

447
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:59,900
Maybe he'd be good for Dawn.

448
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:03,671
What? Oh... [snort laughs]
No, no, no.

449
00:25:03,771 --> 00:25:05,773
I think he had a ring on.

450
00:25:05,873 --> 00:25:07,742
Nice guy.

451
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:10,878
Nervous. From Connecticut.

452
00:25:10,978 --> 00:25:13,147
Connecticut? What the hell
is he doing here?

453
00:25:13,247 --> 00:25:15,549
-I have no idea.
-Girl, park it for a minute.

454
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:17,318
We bought you something.

455
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:20,221
-Not you.
-Oh.

456
00:25:20,321 --> 00:25:23,024
-A present.
-That is so sweet.

457
00:25:23,124 --> 00:25:25,593
You shouldn't have.

00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:27,361
<i>What a Mama You're Gonna Be.</i>

459
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:29,230
I researched
all the best baby books

460
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,132
and this one was so sweet.

461
00:25:31,232 --> 00:25:33,768
Look here.

462
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:38,272
there's a place to write
your first letter to your baby.

463
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:41,475
"Dear baby"

464
00:25:41,575 --> 00:25:44,712
That's really great.

465
00:25:44,812 --> 00:25:48,482
Now we know you didn't
initially have a strong...

466
00:25:48,582 --> 00:25:50,751
happiness about this pregnancy,

467
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,887
but she is coming anyway.

468
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,855
Oh, well, we don't know
it's a she.

469
00:25:54,955 --> 00:25:59,160
I mean, it could be an alien.

470
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,295
Now you're not getting
any more affectionate toward
this little baby?

471
00:26:01,395 --> 00:26:04,031
-Not at all?
-Not everyone wants
to be a mama, Dawn.

472
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,933
That doesn't make me
a bad person.

473
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:07,902
Can I interest the book club
in some coffee

474
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:11,372
and a slice
of Sit On Your Ass pie?

475
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:14,275
Oh, that's a good one, Cal.

476
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:17,344
And you know, I love
what you've done with your hair.

477
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:20,648
Tell me, how'd you get it
to come out your nostrils
like that?

-Opening up!
-Mm-hmm.

479
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,119
So did you tell Earl yet?

480
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,588
It didn't come up.

481
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,723
Hey, Dawn, did you finish
writing your profile yet?

482
00:26:29,824 --> 00:26:30,758
We're not done talking
about you.

483
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:32,793
I think we are. Dawn?

484
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:36,697
Um, I'm still writing it.

485
00:26:36,797 --> 00:26:39,366
You have been writing it
for weeks.

486
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,735
Well, there's just not enough
space to complete a compelling,

yet thorough, honest,
description of myself.

00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:46,740

run what you got by us?

1024
00:57:58,679 --> 00:57:59,780
I'm gonna go talk to Dawn
for a minute,

1025
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,982
see if she won't
tell you herself.

1026
00:58:01,082 --> 00:58:03,017
That would be wonderful.

1027
00:58:03,117 --> 00:58:09,757
-I thought you'd like that.
-I do. I do.

1028
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,727
Dawn!

1029
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:14,762
There is a man at table five

1030
00:58:14,862 --> 00:58:16,496
on a mission with your name
on it.

1031
00:58:16,597 --> 00:58:20,034
His name is Ogie.

1032
00:58:20,134 --> 00:58:23,371
Short for Oklahoma.

1033
00:58:23,471 --> 00:58:25,806
He's OKCwithaBullet!

1034
00:58:25,906 --> 00:58:33,047
Ahh!

1035
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:36,417
He's an amateur magician,

1036
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:39,587
does competitive clog dancing

1037
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:42,923
and only eats white food
on Wednesdays.

1038
00:58:43,024 --> 00:58:45,626
-He told me we were soulmates.
-Girl!

1039
00:58:45,726 --> 00:58:48,295
I made the mistake
of telling him I work here.

1040
00:58:48,396 --> 00:58:52,066
Oh, I don't know, Dawn.
I think it sounds like
he's got potential.

1041
00:58:52,166 --> 00:58:54,135
He took me through
the entire medical

1042
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:58,472
and psychiatric history
of his whole family.

1043
00:58:58,572 --> 00:59:01,776
Oh, he's laying it
all on the table.

1044
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,477
I just wanted
a quiet first date.

1045
00:59:03,577 --> 00:59:05,813
Stimulating conversation.

1046
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:08,115
First man who ever shows
any interest in me

1047
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:11,218
and he turns out to be
a mad, clogging elf.

that magic love pie
was too good.

1050
00:59:18,592 --> 00:59:20,494
I should never
have brought it with me.

1051
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:22,163
I don't think
it was the pie, Dawn.

1052
00:59:22,263 --> 00:59:24,533

00:59:24,632 --> 00:59:26,767
-Come with me.
-I would, but I gotta go pee.

1054
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:31,372

the elf's order?

1055

this up a little bit.
-Becky, no!

01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:04,605
Hello, good morning. Hello.
I told you I didn't want

1061
01:00:04,705 --> 01:00:07,842
to see you again.
May I take your order?

1062
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,611
I'll have an egg white omelet

1063
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:13,848

and a side of mayonnaise.

1064
01:00:13,948 --> 01:00:19,053
I have very exquisite taste.

1065
01:00:19,153 --> 01:00:21,021
What kind of toast with that?
White or wheat?

1066
01:00:21,122 --> 01:00:23,891
Why am I even asking?
It's Wednesday!

1067
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:26,494
You see? We already know
each other so intimately.

1069

You're NewDawnRising.

1071
01:00:31,899 --> 01:00:34,235
Easily misunderstood,

1072
01:00:34,335 --> 01:00:37,671
but I see your true beauty.

1073
01:00:37,771 --> 01:00:39,840
Normally I wouldn't do this.

1074
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,409
Actually, I've never done this.

1075
01:00:42,511 --> 01:00:43,844
But that five minutes,

1076
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:48,716
it felt like a whole 15

1077
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:50,684
and I am certain we're meant
to be together.

1078
01:00:50,784 --> 01:00:52,753
I don't even know you.

1079

And I love my mother.

1083

What else do you need
to know about me?

1084

1085
01:01:13,174 --> 01:01:15,476
I'll have a slice

1086
01:01:15,577 --> 01:01:17,579

1087
01:01:17,678 --> 01:01:19,213
With or without whipped cream?

1088
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:23,083
You choose.
I trust you implicitly.

1089
01:01:23,184 --> 01:01:25,252
But if you do choose
to have whipped cream,

1090
01:01:25,352 --> 01:01:27,922
I would love it on the side,
not touching the pie.

1091
01:01:28,022 --> 01:01:29,624
I hate it when it
touches the pie.

1092
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:32,026
No, it soggies the crust.

1093
01:01:32,126 --> 01:01:33,861
Yeah, and you can't control
the whipped cream...

-Hi. Is Dr. Pomatter there?

1195
01:07:10,197 --> 01:07:12,065

I'm his patient.

-Hey.

1197
01:07:15,637 --> 01:07:18,606
Hi, Dr. Pomatter.
Listen, I'm sure it's nothing,

1198
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:21,910
but you said to call with
any questions or concerns.

1199
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:25,713
This morning, um,
I'm bleeding a little bit.

1200
01:07:25,813 --> 01:07:27,782
No. No. It's very very light.

1201
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:30,317
Come in to see you?

1202
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:34,221
Tomorrow morning?
You're open at 7:00 AM?

1203
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:36,123
Excuse me,
but I've got a short stack

Hey, listen, Doc,
while I've got you on the line,
between you and me,

1209
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:53,140
I have a bit of a gas issue.

1210
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:55,944
Yeah, I tried that.
Made it worse.

1211
01:07:56,044 --> 01:08:02,482

Um, so, you know,
we spoke on the phone

1221
01:08:31,211 --> 01:08:33,313
and you said that
the bleeding was very mild?

1222
01:08:33,413 --> 01:08:35,415
-Yes.
-Has that stopped?

1223

Well, aren't you
going to examine me?

No. No.

1228
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:51,799
No need.

1229

-Yeah.

Then am I okay?
I mean, there's nothing's
wrong with me?

is a perfectly

in early pregnancy.

-Questions or concerns.
-Any and all.

Wait, wait, wait.
Why did you have me come
all the way here

1249
01:09:57,999 --> 01:10:00,835
if spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom
in early pregnancy?

1250
01:10:00,935 --> 01:10:04,337
I had to get up early
and take a bus and walk
five blocks

1251
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:06,206
just to hear that spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom?

1252

I have no response to that.

9:00? You came in here
two hours early

1256
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:21,022
to tell me that spotting
is a perfectly normal symptom
in early pregnancy?

1257
01:10:21,122 --> 01:10:23,290
It seems that way, yes.

-Bye, Jenna.

I think you're strange.

to be my doctor anymore.

-No, Jenna, no. I'm sorry.

I'm so sorry.
I will not do it anymore.

Look, whatever it is that I do,

1265
01:10:40,608 --> 01:10:41,909
you should not be uncomfortable
during this time.

1356
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:37,938
Well, he's got such
nice strong hands.

1357
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:39,840
All right, I wasn't looking
for it, it was an accident.

1358
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:42,376
An affair is not an accident.

1359
01:15:42,476 --> 01:15:45,679
Dropping a tray is an accident.

1360
01:15:45,780 --> 01:15:48,115
Cal didn't just trip
into your va-jay-jay.

1361
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:53,788
What?

1362
01:16:22,183 --> 01:16:26,587
[applause]

1363
01:16:26,687 --> 01:16:29,490
Look, I'm just having me
a little adventure

1364
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:32,159
after years and years
of lots of nothing.

1365
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:34,395
It was getting so quiet down
there you could hear an echo.

1366
01:16:34,495 --> 01:16:37,131
What about your husband?

1367
01:16:37,231 --> 01:16:39,633
My husband wears Pampers,
curses constantly,

1368
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:41,570
and sleeps in a separate room.

1369
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:43,137
Well, why don't you
just leave him, Becky?

1370
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:45,906
Because I love him.
I wouldn't leave him

1371
01:16:46,006 --> 01:16:47,641
just 'cause I have to change
his diaper three times a day.

1372
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:49,578
What kind of person
would do that?

1373
01:16:49,677 --> 01:16:51,546
Well, what kind of person
has an affair with Cal

1374
01:16:51,645 --> 01:16:53,314
who's married to Ethel?

1375
01:16:53,414 --> 01:16:55,749
Well, Cal thinks she's gay.

1376
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:58,185
Look, they ain't slept
together in 15 years.

1377
01:16:58,285 --> 01:17:00,988
Most married couples haven't
slept together in 15 years.

1378
01:17:01,088 --> 01:17:07,394
But we know Ethel
and she's not...

1379
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:12,466
-She could be.
-Mm-hmm.

1380
01:17:12,567 --> 01:17:15,436
But if he thinks she's gay,
why don't they just divorce?

1381
01:17:15,537 --> 01:17:17,838
Because he loves her.
What kind of man

1382
01:17:17,938 --> 01:17:20,941
would leave his wife
just 'cause she's gay?

1383
01:17:21,041 --> 01:17:23,644
-She--
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1384
01:17:23,744 --> 01:17:27,114
Now you're supposed to be
my friend, not Ethel's.

1385
01:17:27,214 --> 01:17:30,684
And I didn't say nothing
about your early morning
visit to the doc

1386
01:17:30,784 --> 01:17:33,854
when you came back
with your dress on inside out

1387
01:17:33,954 --> 01:17:38,459
'cause you were too busy
putting the pap back in smear.

1388
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:40,629
Okay, that was one time

1389
01:17:40,728 --> 01:17:43,030
and I was not in my right mind.

1390
01:17:43,130 --> 01:17:47,301
-I put the lid on it.
-Of course you did.

1391
01:17:47,401 --> 01:17:48,869
What's that supposed to mean.

1392
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:50,971
Just go back
to your pantry, Jenna.

1393
01:17:51,071 --> 01:17:56,143
Bake yourself another
Bury The Bullshit pie.

1394
01:17:56,243 --> 01:17:58,379
Well, you got me
all figured out, don't you?

1395
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:00,814
You got everything
all figured out.

I almost called you
just to apologize.

it's never gonna happen again.

And how's the charming husband?

1520
01:25:56,591 --> 01:25:58,826
-Charming as ever.
-Right.

1521
01:25:58,926 --> 01:26:03,230
And the lipstick smudger?

1522
01:26:03,330 --> 01:26:05,499
-What?
-Oh, you know,

1523
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:09,169
the dog on the side? The affair.

1524
01:26:09,269 --> 01:26:11,471
Okay, I'm--

1525
01:26:11,572 --> 01:26:14,241
I'm not having
an "affair" affair.

1526
01:26:14,341 --> 01:26:16,811
-It's just a--
-An affair.

1527
01:26:16,911 --> 01:26:19,580
Your lipstick's all smudged

1528
01:26:19,681 --> 01:26:23,183
like someone gave you
a good one.

1529
01:26:23,283 --> 01:26:25,553
When you're done wiping away
your indiscretions,

1530
01:26:25,653 --> 01:26:27,689
-you wanna hear your horoscope?
-No.

1531
01:26:27,789 --> 01:26:32,794
"Aquarius. Even if you have
a miserable snake husband,

1532
01:26:32,894 --> 01:26:36,396
you probably shouldn't
be having no affair,

1533
01:26:36,496 --> 01:26:38,566
'cause it's beneath you

1534
01:26:38,666 --> 01:26:41,169
and could make you seem
like a common...

1535
01:26:41,268 --> 01:26:43,604
hussy.

1536
01:26:43,705 --> 01:26:46,339
Not to mention the pain
you could cause

1537
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,577
to other people."

1538
01:26:49,677 --> 01:26:52,279
This afternoon
I will have the Singing
Tuney Fish Casserole,

1539
01:26:52,379 --> 01:26:54,782
no pickle on the plate.

1540
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:58,753
Well-done Frenchie fries.
On their own plate.

1541
01:26:58,853 --> 01:27:03,423
And Jenna's
Devil's Food Oasis pie.

1542
01:27:03,524 --> 01:27:06,728
That's the one you should bake
for that contest

1543
01:27:06,828 --> 01:27:09,197
so you can win that money

1544
01:27:09,296 --> 01:27:11,833
and leave your husband
fair and square

1545
01:27:11,933 --> 01:27:17,739
and smudge your lipstick
with whomever the hell you want.

1546
01:27:17,839 --> 01:27:20,675
Joe you really think that pie
is good enough to win?

1547
01:27:20,775 --> 01:27:25,113
Oh, that pie
is a thing of beauty.

1548
01:27:25,213 --> 01:27:29,249
How each flavor
opens itself, one by one,

1549
01:27:29,349 --> 01:27:31,485
-like a chapter in a book.
-[bell rings]

1550
01:27:31,586 --> 01:27:34,622
First you get flooded
with chocolate,

1551
01:27:34,722 --> 01:27:38,291
dark and bittersweet
like an old flame.

1552
01:27:38,391 --> 01:27:41,596
And then strawberry,

1553
01:27:41,696 --> 01:27:45,800
the way strawberry
was always supposed to taste

1554
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:50,238
but never knew how.

1555
01:27:50,337 --> 01:27:53,473
In fact, you know what?
Forget all the other stuff
I ordered.

1556
01:27:53,574 --> 01:27:57,979
Just bring me the damn pie.
What are you waiting for?

1557
01:27:58,079 --> 01:28:01,249
I don't believe for one second

1558
01:28:01,348 --> 01:28:04,519
that you're as mean as you play.

1559
01:28:04,619 --> 01:28:07,121
You tip me better than anyone.

1560
01:28:07,221 --> 01:28:10,057
If you're noticing I'm having
a hard time walking today,

1561
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:11,626
Keep it between us.

1562
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:14,128
[laughs]

1563
01:28:14,228 --> 01:28:15,428
This is really heating up.

1564
01:28:15,530 --> 01:28:17,799
He is so passionate.

1565
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:19,366
You wouldn't know
it to look at him,

1566
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:23,171
but he is a sexual dynamo.

1567
01:28:23,271 --> 01:28:25,840
No, you wouldn't know it.

1568
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:29,844
Well, he's amorous
yet clean and well organized.

1569
01:28:29,944 --> 01:28:32,479
And when he recites
his spontaneous poetry,

1570
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:34,916
well... [snort laughs]

1571
01:28:35,016 --> 01:28:36,349
I'm multi-orgasmic.

1572
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:40,254
I had no idea!

1573
01:28:40,353 --> 01:28:42,322
No, I didn't either
and believe me

1574
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:44,225
it's something I did not need
to know.

1575
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:46,761
Order up.

1576
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:49,730
Perhaps you could take
some pointers, Cal.

1577
01:28:49,831 --> 01:28:51,933
Perhaps you
could take this slice

1578
01:28:52,033 --> 01:28:56,537
of Twisted Kentucky Pecan
pie to table five.

1579
01:28:56,637 --> 01:29:00,274
I didn't realize
it was hot and ready.

1580
01:29:00,373 --> 01:29:05,112
Girl, it's been hot all morning.

1581
01:29:05,213 --> 01:29:10,818
[intense guitar riff]

1582
01:29:10,918 --> 01:29:13,221
Hey, buddy.

1583
01:29:13,321 --> 01:29:15,523
I'm waiting on Dawn.

1584
01:29:15,623 --> 01:29:17,859
She's meeting my mother tonight.

1585
01:29:17,959 --> 01:29:21,696
I'm taking them to Stanton
Grove for the steak dinner.

1586
01:29:21,796 --> 01:29:24,098
It's getting serious.
Real, real serious.

1587
01:29:24,198 --> 01:29:26,100
Come on man, you got this.

1588
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,735
-Ooh.
-Hey.

1589
01:29:27,835 --> 01:29:29,670
Breathe.

1590
01:29:29,770 --> 01:29:31,706
[inhales]

1591
01:29:31,806 --> 01:29:33,074
Dawn Pinkett!

1592
01:29:33,174 --> 01:29:35,276
Ogie?

1593
01:29:35,375 --> 01:29:37,245
Every day I think of you,

1594
01:29:37,345 --> 01:29:40,748
I think yes.

1595
01:29:40,848 --> 01:29:42,884
Oh, he's making me a poem
right here.

1596
01:29:42,984 --> 01:29:47,588
We hold these truths
to be self-evident.

1597
01:29:47,688 --> 01:29:51,391
Yes. I am more
than he who audits.

1598
01:29:51,491 --> 01:29:54,729
I am poetry and sex

1599
01:29:54,829 --> 01:29:56,097
and I'm living a dream. Love.

1600
01:29:56,197 --> 01:30:00,001
Yes. Uh...

1601
01:30:00,101 --> 01:30:02,270
uh-huh. Yes.

1602
01:30:02,370 --> 01:30:04,471
Oh, my God.

1603
01:30:04,572 --> 01:30:07,008
Will you bus my tables
so I can...

1604
01:30:07,108 --> 01:30:11,379
[both] Yes!

1605
01:30:11,478 --> 01:30:15,049
Oh, thank you. You know, Jenna,
I must admit

1606
01:30:15,149 --> 01:30:19,787
I don't really feel
I understood the Declaration
of Independence until now.

1607
01:30:19,887 --> 01:30:23,124
Life, liberty...

1608
01:30:23,224 --> 01:30:26,327
And the Pursuit
of Happiness pie.

1609
01:30:26,426 --> 01:30:28,996
<i>♪ Sugar ♪</i>

1610
01:30:29,096 --> 01:30:31,732
<i>♪ Sugar, butter, flour ♪</i>

1611
01:30:31,832 --> 01:30:34,368
Meld warm
Golden Delicious apples

1612
01:30:34,467 --> 01:30:38,506
with free flowing brown sugar.

1613
01:30:38,606 --> 01:30:41,976
Mix with cinnamon and allspice.

1614
01:30:42,076 --> 01:30:46,213
Fold in cocoa chiffon...

1615
01:30:46,314 --> 01:30:49,850
until they merge
together perfectly.

1616
01:30:49,951 --> 01:30:52,286
Top with peaks of everlasting
Chantilly cream.

1617
01:30:52,386 --> 01:30:54,454
-Missus...
-Hunterson?

1618
01:30:54,555 --> 01:30:55,856
And dust gently
with powdered sugar.

1619
01:30:55,957 --> 01:30:57,625
Mrs. Hunterson?

1620
01:30:57,725 --> 01:30:59,026
And garnish with rose petals.

1621
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:01,762
Mrs. Hunterson!

1622
01:31:01,862 --> 01:31:04,598
Doctor Pomatter and his wife

1623
01:31:04,699 --> 01:31:09,403
had to fly back east
for a funeral this morning.

1624
01:31:09,502 --> 01:31:12,073
Oh, he flew back east
with his wife?

1625
01:31:12,173 --> 01:31:14,875
Yes.

1626
01:31:14,976 --> 01:31:17,678
So guess who's gonna examine
your cha-cha today?

1627
01:31:17,778 --> 01:31:19,380
Me.

1628
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:25,219
[laughs]

1629
01:31:25,319 --> 01:31:31,258
I'm just kidding.

1630
01:31:32,526 --> 01:31:34,628
You look like shit, girl.

1631
01:31:34,729 --> 01:31:37,198
You feeling okay?

1632
01:31:37,298 --> 01:31:41,335
Yeah. I'm fine. I'm just--
you know, the baby.

1633
01:31:41,435 --> 01:31:44,038
Of course.

1634
01:31:44,138 --> 01:31:47,541
How's it working out
with Doctor Pomatter?

1635
01:31:47,641 --> 01:31:50,277
Oh, he's very professional.

1636
01:31:50,378 --> 01:31:52,680
Isn't he?

1637
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:58,252
Such a lovely bedside manner.

1638
01:31:58,352 --> 01:32:01,822
Is that pie for me?

1639
01:32:01,922 --> 01:32:05,259
-I guess.
-Looks so yummy.

1640
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:09,497
What kind is it?

1641
01:32:09,597 --> 01:32:15,202
The Pursuit of Happiness pie.

1642
01:32:15,302 --> 01:32:21,609
We could all use
a slice of that.

1643
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,249
Ah.

1644
01:32:28,349 --> 01:32:33,621
Heartbeat strong and steady.

1645
01:32:33,721 --> 01:32:37,324
Here, take a listen.

1646
01:32:37,425 --> 01:32:43,631
[heart beating]

1647
01:32:58,145 --> 01:33:00,481
Dear baby...

1648
01:33:00,581 --> 01:33:06,020
[soft piano music]

1649
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:12,293
Let me begin
by saying I'm sorry.

1650
01:33:12,393 --> 01:33:14,628
Don't take it personally, baby,

1651
01:33:14,728 --> 01:33:16,764
if I don't seem like
all the other mamas

1652
01:33:16,864 --> 01:33:22,236
jumping all over
themselves with joy.

1653
01:33:22,336 --> 01:33:27,542
I wish I could feel excitement
that you're with me now.

1654
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:33,147
Or faith
that I'd be a good mama.

1655
01:33:33,247 --> 01:33:35,216
Even if my life is a mess.

1656
01:33:35,316 --> 01:33:38,219
And the world, as I see it,

1657
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:44,526
isn't so pretty
like they'd have you believe
in that baby book.

1658
01:33:45,126 --> 01:33:50,798
I frankly don't know what
I've got to give you, baby.

1659
01:33:50,898 --> 01:33:52,534
What if I don't win that contest

1660
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:55,703
and don't have no money

1661
01:33:55,803 --> 01:33:59,640
and I can't leave Earl?

1662
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:05,514
What the hell am I gonna
do with you then?

1663
01:34:05,614 --> 01:34:08,916
Some days I think I should
just give you

1664
01:34:09,016 --> 01:34:14,556
to a nice family who could
give you what I can't.

1665
01:34:14,655 --> 01:34:20,227
I wish I could just run away.

1666
01:34:21,395 --> 01:34:25,299
What kind of mama is that?

1667
01:34:25,399 --> 01:34:28,035
[Jim] Jenna.

1668
01:34:28,135 --> 01:34:30,639
What are you doing here?
You can't just come here.

1669
01:34:30,738 --> 01:34:34,175
I had to see you.
It's been weeks.

1670
01:34:34,275 --> 01:34:36,645
I can't take this
not knowing how you are.

1671
01:34:36,744 --> 01:34:39,313
-Dr. Pomatter,
we have to end this.
-Why?

1672
01:34:39,413 --> 01:34:41,650
Because I've been thinking a lot

1673
01:34:41,749 --> 01:34:44,051
while you were away
with your wife

1674
01:34:44,151 --> 01:34:47,321
and I can't live with myself.

1675
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:49,056
But, Jenna, I'm not gonna
have a conversation about
how crazy this is,

1676
01:34:49,156 --> 01:34:51,492
about how bad my judgment is,

1677
01:34:51,593 --> 01:34:52,760
about how sorry I am.
I'd be lying.

1678
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:55,362
Don't say anything else.

1679
01:34:55,462 --> 01:35:02,169
Don't talk me out of it.
Just go.

1680
01:35:09,843 --> 01:35:17,652
I don't know how to do this.

1681
01:35:18,018 --> 01:35:23,991
I haven't felt
anything like this.

1682
01:35:24,191 --> 01:35:32,366
I haven't felt
in a very long time.

1683
01:35:32,466 --> 01:35:38,138
Neither have I.

1684
01:35:38,305 --> 01:35:43,877
So what now?

1685
01:35:43,978 --> 01:35:48,550
Maybe you can teach me
how to make a pie.

1686
01:35:48,650 --> 01:35:52,753
-Seriously?
-Yeah, seriously.

1687
01:35:52,853 --> 01:35:54,522
Okay. Sure, I could do that.

1688
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:55,657
Okay, I brought you something.

1689
01:35:55,756 --> 01:35:57,726
It's a--

1690
01:35:57,825 --> 01:36:00,629
it's a present.

1691
01:36:00,729 --> 01:36:02,196
-For me?

01:46:28,823 --> 01:46:33,493
Let me feel a little
philanthropopical now.

1864
01:46:33,594 --> 01:46:34,896
I don't want you to worry
about nothing

1865
01:46:34,996 --> 01:46:38,299
but baking yourself
a better life.

1866
01:46:38,398 --> 01:46:40,301
All right now?

1867
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,004
When you win that contest,

1868
01:46:43,104 --> 01:46:44,939
you think you're gonna
get one of them big

1869
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:47,675
giant checks that are
the size of a door?

1870
01:46:47,775 --> 01:46:49,277
Always wondered
how you cash one of those.

1871
01:46:49,377 --> 01:46:51,345
[laughs]

1872
01:46:51,444 --> 01:46:52,914
Maybe we should have an affair.

1873
01:46:53,014 --> 01:46:54,916
Uh-uh. No ma'am.

1874
01:46:55,016 --> 01:46:56,684
This ain't no affair.

1875
01:46:56,784 --> 01:46:59,120
I'm in this for life, okay?

1876
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:03,624
[clapping]

1877
01:47:03,724 --> 01:47:07,962
Okay, scoot. Vamoose. Skadoodle.

1878
01:47:08,062 --> 01:47:10,364
This reminds me

1879
01:47:10,497 --> 01:47:13,334
of my third wedding

1880
01:47:13,433 --> 01:47:17,204
to Sara Cherie Caputo.

1881
01:47:17,305 --> 01:47:20,675
Now she was a screamer.

1882
01:47:20,775 --> 01:47:24,645
-Joe!
-I was just trying to point
out her good qualities.

1883
01:47:24,745 --> 01:47:28,783
Oh, man, she was nasty.

1884
01:47:28,883 --> 01:47:31,552
I'm gonna invent
a special pie for you

1885
01:47:31,652 --> 01:47:35,423
called Old Joe's Horny Past pie.

1886
01:47:35,523 --> 01:47:37,558
You should enter
that one in that contest.

1887
01:47:37,658 --> 01:47:39,660
Wake those old biddies up.

1888
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:42,096
Maybe I'll just bake it for you.

1889
01:47:42,196 --> 01:47:44,699
That'd have to wait.

1890
01:47:44,799 --> 01:47:46,499
My doctor says
I shouldn't be eating

1891
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:48,501
all this sweet stuff.

1892
01:47:48,602 --> 01:47:52,273
My liver's acting up.

1893
01:47:52,373 --> 01:47:55,376
I got to have a piece
of it removed.

1894
01:47:55,475 --> 01:47:57,678
-Oh, Joe.
-Yeah.

1895
01:47:57,778 --> 01:48:00,281
Last time I was in the hospital

1896
01:48:00,381 --> 01:48:02,516
the nurse strapped me to a bed,

1897
01:48:02,616 --> 01:48:06,587
pulled down my pants
and shot me in the ass.

1898
01:48:06,687 --> 01:48:09,457
Not too shabby.

1899
01:48:09,557 --> 01:48:11,158
Not too shabby.

1900
01:48:11,258 --> 01:48:13,327
So you better promise me

1901
01:48:13,427 --> 01:48:16,097
that you will bake to win.

1902
01:48:16,197 --> 01:48:18,866
[soft music]

1903
01:48:18,966 --> 01:48:22,436
Whoa, whoa, pie-lady.
You're shaking.

1904
01:48:22,536 --> 01:48:24,205
I don't know
what I'm more scared of,

1905
01:48:24,305 --> 01:48:27,508
losing or winning.

1906
01:48:27,608 --> 01:48:29,210
I don't know, Joe.
Maybe I should just make peace

1907
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:31,245
with happy enough
like my mama did.

1908
01:48:31,345 --> 01:48:35,583
Maybe it's too late for me.

Excuse me, I'm just--
I'm gonna borrow my wife.

1940
01:51:07,569 --> 01:51:09,503
Say your goodbyes,
we're going home.

1941
01:51:09,604 --> 01:51:11,672
-Who invited you?
-Have another piece of pie,
old man!

1942
01:51:11,772 --> 01:51:12,641
-Come on!
-Please don't.
You'll make it worse.

1943
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:16,143
Let's go.

1944
01:51:16,243 --> 01:51:17,978
Jenna! Please stay.

1945
01:51:18,078 --> 01:51:20,447
I am so sorry. Bye sweetheart.

1946
01:51:20,549 --> 01:51:22,049
-Don't leave!
-I love you.

1947
01:51:22,149 --> 01:51:23,684

[music ends]

1950
01:51:47,241 --> 01:51:50,579
You must think
I'm really stupid.

1951
01:51:50,679 --> 01:51:57,017
-No.
-No?

1952
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,854
[sniffles]

1953
01:52:00,955 --> 01:52:05,292
Unzip that cushion.

1954
01:52:05,392 --> 01:52:10,998
-I don't want--
-Do it!

1955
01:52:18,038 --> 01:52:20,774
What is that, Jenna? Hmm?

1956
01:52:20,874 --> 01:52:22,476
What is that?

1957
01:52:22,577 --> 01:52:23,645
It's money.

1958
01:52:23,744 --> 01:52:27,014
That's money?

1959
01:52:27,114 --> 01:52:30,284
Hidden all over the house?

1960
01:52:30,384 --> 01:52:32,886
In the drawers,

1961
01:52:32,987 --> 01:52:37,024
in the cabinets,
in the fucking sofa!

1962
01:52:37,124 --> 01:52:40,729
-It's money hidden
all over my house.
-I'm sorry.

1963
01:52:40,828 --> 01:52:44,465
After everything
that I have done for you,

1964
01:52:44,566 --> 01:52:47,034
you go and hide money from me?

1965
01:52:47,134 --> 01:52:49,803
I was the only one
that was there for you

1966
01:52:49,903 --> 01:52:52,741
after your mama died

1967
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:58,979
and your daddy was piss drunk
every night.

1968
01:52:59,079 --> 01:53:00,848
You forget about that?!

1969
01:53:00,948 --> 01:53:03,450
Do I need this?

1970
01:53:03,551 --> 01:53:06,053
Do I need this right now?

1971
01:53:06,153 --> 01:53:11,559
Earl, oh, my God, stop!
You love that guitar!

1972
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:15,664
You...

1973
01:53:15,764 --> 01:53:19,466
are the only thing
that I've ever loved.

1974
01:53:19,567 --> 01:53:23,404
You are the only person
that has ever belonged to me.

1975
01:53:23,504 --> 01:53:26,240
You're my wife.

1976
01:53:26,340 --> 01:53:28,710
[chuckles]

1977
01:53:28,809 --> 01:53:31,613
You are my whole life.

1978
01:53:31,713 --> 01:53:37,451
And you having
a secret from me...

1979
01:53:37,552 --> 01:53:43,290
it just tears me apart.

1980
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:53,867
Why are you hiding money

1981
01:53:53,967 --> 01:53:59,473
all over the house?

1982
01:53:59,574 --> 01:54:04,011
-I want to go--
-No, no, just tell me you
were gonna surprise me.

1983
01:54:04,111 --> 01:54:07,448
-No, Earl.
-Tell me you were gonna
buy me a present.

1984
01:54:07,549 --> 01:54:10,752
Because if I ever thought
that you weren't happy
being my wife,

1985
01:54:10,851 --> 01:54:13,688
that you were deceiving me,

1986
01:54:13,788 --> 01:54:16,825
I would want to kill myself.

1987
01:54:16,924 --> 01:54:20,361
[sobbing] I would want to die.

1988
01:54:20,461 --> 01:54:24,398
Baby, please hold me.

1989
01:54:24,498 --> 01:54:30,605
[sobbing]

1990
01:54:32,741 --> 01:54:38,011
The truth is, Earl--

1991
01:54:38,112 --> 01:54:42,449
the truth is...

1992
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:46,920
I was saving that money...

1993
01:54:47,020 --> 01:54:52,527
for the baby.

1994
01:54:52,627 --> 01:54:55,396
To buy some nice things.

1995
01:54:55,496 --> 01:55:00,802
A crib and toys.

1996
01:55:00,901 --> 01:55:04,505
It was all for the baby.

1997
01:55:04,606 --> 01:55:07,842
It was for the baby?

1998
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:15,048
Yes, Earl. For a crib.

1999
01:55:23,290 --> 01:55:25,459
I don't know why you have
to make it

2000
01:55:25,560 --> 01:55:32,366
so hard, Jenna.

2001
01:55:35,002 --> 01:55:42,209
I just want us to be happy.

2002
01:55:59,393 --> 01:56:05,399
[soft music]

2003
01:56:36,598 --> 01:56:42,604
Dear baby,

2004
01:56:44,706 --> 01:56:51,579
if you ever want to
know the story of how we bought
your crib, I'll tell you.

2005
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:53,480
Your crib was bought
with the money

2006
01:56:53,581 --> 01:57:00,722
I was gonna use to buy us
a new life.

2007
01:57:00,822 --> 01:57:08,128

Hi, is everyone decent?

2206
02:09:53,662 --> 02:09:55,996
-Ogie, come here. Come here.
-Okay.

2207
02:09:56,096 --> 02:09:59,701
Jenna, Ogie and I
want you to know

2208
02:09:59,833 --> 02:10:02,002
that you can stay with us
for a while until you get
back on your feet.

2209
02:10:02,102 --> 02:10:04,972
You could stay with us,

2210
02:10:05,072 --> 02:10:07,642
but I think
Phil's convulsions might
frighten the baby.

2211
02:10:07,742 --> 02:10:10,978
Look, Ogie. Isn't she beautiful?

2212
02:10:11,078 --> 02:10:15,883
There are no words...

2213
02:10:15,983 --> 02:10:17,752
but I'm double-parked
so I got to run.

2214
02:10:17,851 --> 02:10:20,254
I got to go. I love you.
I love you.

2215
02:10:20,354 --> 02:10:21,723
Love you, new baby.
Got to go. I love you.
I love you.

2216
02:10:21,822 --> 02:10:27,629
I love you. I love you.

02:10:27,729 --> 02:10:30,230
Dawn, don't we have
some business

2218
02:10:30,331 --> 02:10:32,199

2219
02:10:32,299 --> 02:10:34,669
-No.
-Dawn.

2220
02:10:34,769 --> 02:10:40,374

2223
02:10:49,416 --> 02:10:53,053
You ever seen a baby
this beautiful before?

2224
02:10:53,153 --> 02:10:57,024
Out of the 762
that I have delivered,

2225
02:10:57,124 --> 02:11:01,696
between us, she is definitely
the most beautiful.

2226
02:11:01,796 --> 02:11:03,565
Nurse Norma,
can you get Mrs. Hunterson

2227
02:11:03,665 --> 02:11:09,604
her complimentary burp cloths?

2228
02:11:10,805 --> 02:11:12,473

this shit flies,

2229
02:11:12,574 --> 02:11:16,544

2231
02:11:19,814 --> 02:11:23,685
I know what you're thinking.

2232
02:11:23,785 --> 02:11:26,186
Yeah. no I don't. That's a lie.

2234

I'm thinking...

2236
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:42,136
I could never thank you enough

2237
02:11:42,236 --> 02:11:47,809
for everything
you've done for me.

2238
02:11:47,908 --> 02:11:50,043
And I'm thinking
your wife's around.

2239
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:53,848
And you shouldn't kiss me.

2240
02:11:53,947 --> 02:11:56,818
The way she looks at you.

2241
02:11:56,917 --> 02:12:03,190
So much trust.

2242
02:12:04,759 --> 02:12:06,927
We could have
a big drama that gets
drawn out here

2243
02:12:07,027 --> 02:12:11,999
for a couple years
and makes everyone miserable,

2244
02:12:12,099 --> 02:12:16,704
or we could end it right here.

2245
02:12:16,805 --> 02:12:22,677
No body count.

2246
02:12:27,080 --> 02:12:32,453

2247
