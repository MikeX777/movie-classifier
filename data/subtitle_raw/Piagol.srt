Chul-soo.

18
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:53,798
Form the ranks,

19
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:17,055
2 deaths, 1 injured, 1 lost Carbine.

20
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,897
What? A carbine?

21
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:36,783
Did you bring the carbine
from the dead?

22
00:06:36,853 --> 00:06:37,820
Yes, sir.

23
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:50,924
Who's the one that lost it?

24
00:06:56,506 --> 00:06:57,495
Step forward.

25
00:07:21,931 --> 00:07:26,459
Are you prepared to be shot dead?

26
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:05,670
Captain, I climbed onto the wall
of the police office.

27
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:11,207
I got shot on my arm, and lost it.

28
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:16,580
I got converging fires at that time.

29
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,449
So I couldn't climb over
the wall and lost it,

30
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:28,521
captain...

31
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:17,272
You gave them your carbine
instead of taking their ammunition?

32
00:09:19,482 --> 00:09:24,419
Comrades, we failed this time
due to wrong information.

33
00:09:25,822 --> 00:09:34,491
There left only our revenge
on the Namsanli villagers, got that?

34
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,163
Start!

35
00:10:19,942 --> 00:10:22,001
Ah, it's far away.

36
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:23,744
What?

37
00:10:24,347 --> 00:10:25,939
Our fates to be chased like this.

38
00:10:26,015 --> 00:10:27,983
It is far away to have good days...

39
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:54,804
Never having a situation to live
in a steady place anywhere.

40
00:10:57,447 --> 00:11:01,645
The supply fight is a trouble
these days, too.

41
00:11:01,717 --> 00:11:05,517
Chinese troops aren't coming,
our soldiers are decreasing,

42
00:11:06,689 --> 00:11:08,520
so the liberation day is far away.

43
00:11:08,591 --> 00:11:11,185
Now I can't even trust
what the officials say.

44
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,420
Shish...

45
00:11:15,465 --> 00:11:18,366
how dare you say that?

46
00:11:32,748 --> 00:11:36,377
Just between you and me,

47
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:42,387
Armistice has already been concluded.
Who would come?

48
00:12:10,052 --> 00:12:12,748
Comrade Soju,
captain is calling you.

49
00:12:13,756 --> 00:12:14,916
Go to see him.

50
00:13:00,803 --> 00:13:03,499
Soju, what's so funny?

51
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:07,439
I'm busy.
I'm going to see the captain.

52
00:13:29,832 --> 00:13:32,300
Our republic intends to abandon us?

53
00:13:33,736 --> 00:13:35,067
Why do you say that again?

54
00:13:35,805 --> 00:13:38,774
They seem to cut the line
after the truce.

55
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:40,935
Probably.

56
00:13:43,512 --> 00:13:45,912
Was Soviet Union hurry
to conclude the truce?

57
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:49,608
Why do you keep saying that?

58
00:13:50,386 --> 00:13:52,911
It could be harsh to the leaders' ears.

59
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,850
Who live in Namsanli?

60
00:13:59,362 --> 00:14:01,455
My mother and uncle.

61
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,462
I see.

62
00:14:04,634 --> 00:14:08,900
It's Soju again. Barely 2 measures
of barley rice and women's clothes...

63
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:13,772
Soju didn't complete her duty
and she's only proud of her skill.

64
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:17,345
Ae-ran is much better than her.

65
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:19,278
I'm different in my background..

66
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:22,283
Right, you are from North Union Party.

67
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:26,685
There you are.

68
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,257
Come in.
Captain is waiting for you.

69
00:14:52,481 --> 00:14:54,711
You care for the laundry and diary.

70
00:15:13,703 --> 00:15:15,170
Chul-soo must be deaf.

71
00:15:25,214 --> 00:15:29,810
Huh! The laundry smells much like Soju.

72
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,222
Comrade

73
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:39,186
be careful with your words.

74
00:15:39,261 --> 00:15:41,126
Why? You don't like it?

75
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,670
Soju must be busy with

76
00:15:53,743 --> 00:15:57,008
doing laundry and
being warned by captain.

77
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:58,876
She must be overworking.

78
00:16:07,823 --> 00:16:10,087
You don't need to be bothered by Soju?

79
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:35,312
Huh, you neglect your duty, Soju, and
you still don't throw out the female temper.

80
00:16:35,384 --> 00:16:36,976
Thus, you have weak spirit
for our communist party.

81
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,088
I see. I'll never do that again.

82
00:16:55,337 --> 00:16:58,864
For us, a grain of rice is
more precious than this.

83
00:17:35,578 --> 00:17:36,545
Comrade, Soju.

84
00:17:37,646 --> 00:17:38,374
Let go,

85
00:17:42,017 --> 00:17:42,745
let go.

86
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,820
Anyways, our captain is the best!

87
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:53,787
Did you see it yesterday, didn't you?

88
00:17:54,363 --> 00:17:59,357
Once captain doesn't like, it's over.

89
00:18:00,002 --> 00:18:06,032
Not to mention it, do you recall
the purge in Baemsa village last fall?

90
00:18:07,243 --> 00:18:10,542
Ah, you mean the reactionary
who tried to surrender himself to us?

91
00:18:10,613 --> 00:18:14,811
Yes. Captain said the guts
of the reactionary were plain,

92
00:18:14,884 --> 00:18:20,186
and that cut and chewed them
with his shitty face.

93
00:18:20,256 --> 00:18:21,814
It's disgusting.

94
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,860
That's warning from his conduct.

95
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:28,955
You learned it in class.

96
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:39,471
Captain,

97
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:46,709
Captain!

98
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,142
What is it?

99
00:18:48,217 --> 00:18:49,309
A messenger came.

100
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,848
Then, you go and talk with him.

101
00:21:01,617 --> 00:21:02,481
Code!

102
00:21:09,825 --> 00:21:10,450
Cloud!

103
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,456
Half Moon.

104
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:36,881
Captain,
Comrade Seo is coming.

105
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:38,010
Chief Captain Seo?

106
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,920
Let them, hurry...

107
00:21:52,134 --> 00:21:54,762
I didn't expect you come suddenly.

108
00:21:55,637 --> 00:21:56,763
You are working hard.

109
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,866
I came here to praise our
brave comrades to encourage.

110
00:22:02,644 --> 00:22:04,339
It's the honor of Agari troop.

111
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,486
Attention!

112
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:32,899
Today, it is my honor

113
00:22:33,942 --> 00:22:37,378
to have this time with you partisans.

114
00:22:38,614 --> 00:22:44,382
You... for our nation, the Soviet Union,

115
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:54,351
during our revolution, with strong spirit...

116
00:22:55,364 --> 00:23:00,097
fought ruthlessly, and it was
our partisans' brilliant results in war

117
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:03,635
that you've completed the attack
of the enemy territory

118
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:09,176
and demolished the bridge
on the fight of May Day.

119
00:23:12,247 --> 00:23:18,379
Today I confer this decoration on Agari

120
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:24,619
always fighting bravely
and praise his service.

121
00:23:33,869 --> 00:23:37,168
Service medal.
Captain of Agari unit, Chu Bong-hyuk.

122
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:41,767
This person is granted this medal
for showing the heroic spirit

123
00:23:41,843 --> 00:23:45,677
in partisan fighting
during National Liberation War.

124
00:23:45,747 --> 00:23:48,079
November 10th, 1953,

125
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,780
North Leader Dept.
of National Provincial Party,
Partisan Headquarters,
Commander Cho, Byung-ha

126
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:08,659
This decoration is given only
with certificate under revolution,

127
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:13,698
but you will see the honor and privilege

128
00:24:14,276 --> 00:24:17,336
will always shine on his chest.

129
00:24:26,355 --> 00:24:27,845
We decide to

130
00:24:27,923 --> 00:24:30,858
grant a pig to other soldiers.

131
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:51,941
Attention.

132
00:25:20,676 --> 00:25:23,509
Comrade Oh Soju, step forward.

133
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:38,954
And, I give an order to Oh Soju

134
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:44,556
to call back to main office,
according to the agreement
at the last military committee.

135
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:46,016
Ae-ran, don't forget to watch
all the staffs at the village.

136
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:52,595
Our Great Leader Kim ll-sung suggested

137
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,700
we stage a purge against reactionaries
before destroy the enemies.

138
00:26:56,438 --> 00:27:02,138
The reactionaries like defaulters,
sneakers and romanticists

139
00:27:02,677 --> 00:27:05,305
in troop should be cleaned up.

140
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:11,949
Line up!

141
00:27:55,797 --> 00:28:02,259
Comrades, we should develop
our fight today.

142
00:28:03,305 --> 00:28:06,365
We should reserve as much as we can

143
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:10,169
we could recall
the serious hunger from last winter,

144
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:14,171
so our departure of today's fight
is Namsanli village.

145
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:17,116
Namsanli village,
a nursery of the reactionary

146
00:28:24,092 --> 00:28:26,151
Namsanli village,
a nursery of the reactionary.

147
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:33,290
We will punish the entire reactionary
and fight for our supply.

148
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:39,700
Though some of us are
from Namsanli,

149
00:28:41,176 --> 00:28:46,773
we should risk our necks for this great
and imminent revolutionary struggle.

150
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:51,114
We should show our
strong spirit for the Party,

151
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:53,620
execrating the reactionary
parents, brothers like enemies.

152
00:28:55,023 --> 00:28:59,255
Complete each of your duty.

153
00:29:00,262 --> 00:29:02,253
Then go!

154
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:50,872
What's wrong?

155
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:52,243
I fell down.

156
00:29:52,314 --> 00:29:53,542
Bastard.

157
00:32:45,253 --> 00:32:46,015
How did it go?

158
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:47,612
Nothing.

159
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:27,113
Mother,

160
00:39:28,856 --> 00:39:29,515
Mother,

161
00:39:41,636 --> 00:39:42,330
Mother,

162
00:39:50,545 --> 00:39:51,477
Mother.

163
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:24,839
Yeah, who is it?

164
00:40:25,646 --> 00:40:26,738
It's me, mom.

165
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:33,643
You! You shot your mom?

166
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:35,721
No... mom.

167
00:40:59,247 --> 00:41:00,339
Mom..

168
00:41:04,118 --> 00:41:06,780
You.. you...

169
00:41:53,801 --> 00:41:54,859
Who shot the old lady?

170
00:41:54,935 --> 00:41:56,562
I did.

171
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:58,264
You didn't know whose house it was?

172
00:42:01,375 --> 00:42:05,004
No, I didn't. I just killed a reactionary.

173
00:42:07,381 --> 00:42:10,612
People would become serious,
after killing that old lady.

174
00:42:11,752 --> 00:42:12,684
It's weird.

175
00:42:13,921 --> 00:42:18,051
Isn't it right we praise his decision
for cleaning up the reactionary?

176
00:43:26,827 --> 00:43:29,022
Comrades, good job.

177
00:43:29,764 --> 00:43:32,631
We should clean up
the reactionary sooner.

178
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:35,294
Ae-ran, take him forward.

179
00:44:02,696 --> 00:44:06,598
You should do this tonight.

180
00:44:09,703 --> 00:44:11,728
Execute the reactionary

181
00:44:12,406 --> 00:44:16,740
in People and Party's name in haste.

182
00:44:27,988 --> 00:44:29,353
I'll execute you reactionaries

183
00:44:29,423 --> 00:44:32,324
with honor of our party.

184
00:44:34,094 --> 00:44:36,892
Step forward, you serious
reactionary headman.

185
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,679
Your Namsanli village is
a hangout of the reactionary.

186
00:45:02,456 --> 00:45:05,289
We have the evidence from
this undercover man in the village,

187
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,793
you aren't supportive
for our partisan's task,

188
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:12,526
which we fight for
people's victory in edge.

189
00:45:13,133 --> 00:45:17,001
We punish you reactionaries
in People and Party's name

190
00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:23,265
for your interruption the day before.

191
00:45:23,944 --> 00:45:24,842
That's right.

192
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:30,748
We'll punish a foe of our brave
comrades who died that night.

193
00:45:30,818 --> 00:45:31,807
Agree!

194
00:45:37,324 --> 00:45:42,762
These sons of bitches informed them
of our mobilization.

195
00:46:01,048 --> 00:46:05,348
You could survive if you help us.

196
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,521
Now you know the guilt of
this bad reactionary.

197
00:46:15,229 --> 00:46:17,220
If you're not guilty and reactionary,

198
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:21,461
you should kill them
with your own hands

199
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:25,904
to prove your faith to out party.

200
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:36,782
Would you survive killing him
with this spear?

201
00:46:37,384 --> 00:46:38,783
Would you die with this gun?

202
00:46:38,852 --> 00:46:40,615
Choose your way.

203
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:44,749
Well...

204
00:46:44,825 --> 00:46:46,622
What do you hesitate for?

205
00:46:47,428 --> 00:46:50,192
If you don't kill him quickly,
I'll shoot you first.

206
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:34,932
Hey!

207
00:47:37,311 --> 00:47:41,407
All right! Kill me! Kill me.

208
00:47:42,683 --> 00:47:45,880
You red bastards! Cruel sons of bitches.

209
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:49,916
Is that communism
that kills the innocent?

210
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:52,550
Kill me, you bastards.

211
00:47:55,929 --> 00:48:02,061
I'll inform your sins
to the world after death.

212
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:05,504
You, reds!

213
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:09,933
What are you doing? Hurry!

214
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,387
You're brave.

215
00:49:03,664 --> 00:49:06,690
This strengthens your spirits
like iron.

216
00:49:06,767 --> 00:49:11,670
Your future task is to report
all the detailed information

217
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:16,399
of village for our party.

218
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:20,478
Your duty should be continued
and passionate.

219
00:49:21,315 --> 00:49:22,407
Otherwise,

220
00:49:22,483 --> 00:49:26,317
we'll disclose to the villagers
that you killed the headman.

221
00:49:28,856 --> 00:49:33,384
Understand?
Now go back to your home.

222
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:39,699
When you go back to the village,
inform that you escaped after captured.

223
00:49:43,904 --> 00:49:46,236
If you betray us, you'll be dead.

224
00:49:55,415 --> 00:49:57,042
Ae-ran, good job.

225
00:49:57,718 --> 00:50:00,744
You have steely strong spirit
for the party.

226
00:50:00,821 --> 00:50:04,484
Now, we expanded our cell
to Namsanli.

227
00:50:07,628 --> 00:50:09,823
it will soon become democratic
without the reactionary.

228
00:50:10,998 --> 00:50:12,693
Let's move.

229
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:15,602
Follow without breaking up your ranks.

230
00:50:44,932 --> 00:50:45,990
Were you well acquainted
with the headman?

231
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:47,090
He's my uncle in my mother side.

232
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,795
What? Is he your uncle?

233
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:53,837
You shouldn't say that in front.

234
00:50:53,907 --> 00:50:57,138
Why did you lag behind?
Don't break up your ranks.

235
00:51:04,518 --> 00:51:06,782
It's inevitable
because he was reactionary.

236
00:51:27,274 --> 00:51:31,335
Captain, he's not my uncle.

237
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:32,810
I've already disowned him.

238
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,142
ldeologies are different.

239
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:38,207
The headman's not related to me.

240
00:51:38,285 --> 00:51:42,619
Son of bitch,
what's this frantic all about?

241
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:47,558
I am a real partisan.
Please forgive me this time, Captain.

242
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:54,666
You just said you sympathized
with the reactionary,

243
00:51:54,735 --> 00:51:56,896
and what're you trying to do?

244
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,904
I did it for old memories.

245
00:51:58,972 --> 00:52:02,100
My uncle paid my tuition.

246
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,939
But he's nothing to me now.

247
00:52:05,012 --> 00:52:06,445
Obviously, he's an enemy.

248
00:52:06,513 --> 00:52:09,277
Captain, please watch
my deeds afterwards.

249
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:12,841
I'll complete all the tasks upon my life.

250
00:52:13,654 --> 00:52:17,090
Son of bitch, your last moment
is such shabby.

251
00:52:17,758 --> 00:52:18,850
Once you're decided to be eliminated,

252
00:52:18,926 --> 00:52:22,259
die quietly with no one to care.

253
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,985
If we keep this kind of
guy with reactionary spirits,

254
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:57,627
we will end up in a disaster.

255
00:52:57,698 --> 00:53:00,963
It's a precaution for him surrendering.

256
00:53:01,668 --> 00:53:03,863
He said he disowned his uncle,

257
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:06,738
but he can't disconnect his blood.

258
00:53:07,908 --> 00:53:09,239
He seemed to be disturbed ideologically

259
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:12,278
before killing the headman.

260
00:53:13,914 --> 00:53:17,350
What? Why didn't you point that
at the critical meeting?

261
00:53:18,752 --> 00:53:21,949
I didn't have a chance to speak...

262
00:53:23,523 --> 00:53:27,118
You were mostly close to ll-dong.

263
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:29,929
So were you negligent in your duty
for solemn party's judgement

264
00:53:29,997 --> 00:53:33,592
with your cheap friendship?

265
00:53:34,801 --> 00:53:37,634
No, no sir. Absolutely not.

266
00:53:38,572 --> 00:53:40,972
Then, you didn't trust the Party's resolution?

267
00:53:47,014 --> 00:53:50,108
I swear. It wasn't on purpose at all.

268
00:53:50,183 --> 00:53:54,279
I'm not good at speaking by nature.

269
00:53:56,456 --> 00:54:01,450
You are old, so you don't tell a lie.

270
00:54:01,528 --> 00:54:03,621
Yes, sir.

271
00:54:06,233 --> 00:54:11,398
Comrade, Ae-ran. Give him a special
lecture for this old fool comrade, huh!

272
00:54:12,672 --> 00:54:13,331
Yes, I will.

273
00:54:22,816 --> 00:54:23,475
Comrades!

274
00:54:28,855 --> 00:54:32,916
I told you that
we keep fighting intensely

275
00:54:33,527 --> 00:54:37,224
even though the truce was made and
our republic can't send reinforcements.

276
00:54:38,165 --> 00:54:43,102
As our staffs are decreasing,

277
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:45,161
don't forget that our direction

278
00:54:45,772 --> 00:54:49,003
for our nation Soviet Union
is staging a purge,

279
00:54:49,076 --> 00:54:53,809
breaking through the enemy's offense,
destroying rear bases,

280
00:54:54,347 --> 00:54:59,842
and perturbing the people
with our strong military spirit.

281
00:55:03,156 --> 00:55:08,560
I want you to arm yourself
with your iron-like ideology.

282
00:56:50,864 --> 00:56:51,831
What are you watching?

283
00:56:52,866 --> 00:56:57,496
Clouds.
Floating continuously and slowly.

284
00:56:58,171 --> 00:56:59,468
They go anywhere, don't they?

285
00:57:00,307 --> 00:57:02,571
We don't need to care for the clouds.

286
00:57:03,343 --> 00:57:06,676
Anyways, Comrade Ae-ran,

287
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:10,406
guess what I'm thinking of now?

288
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:14,884
Do you have a moment to think?

289
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:19,416
What're you talking about?

290
00:57:21,528 --> 00:57:22,358
Well,

291
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:27,059
about how to outlive with lasting life

292
00:57:27,634 --> 00:57:29,795
and without being attacked.

293
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:34,106
And about how to eat beef ribs

294
00:57:34,174 --> 00:57:39,441
after a great supply fight.

295
00:57:42,349 --> 00:57:44,874
No

296
00:57:45,452 --> 00:57:51,186
that's not what I'm thinking of.

297
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:54,883
I think of you.

298
00:57:55,462 --> 00:57:56,292
Me?

299
00:57:58,265 --> 00:58:03,498
About how to keep my nose
to the grindstone?

300
00:58:04,337 --> 00:58:08,034
Uh? No, that's not it.

301
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:14,480
Ae-ran, you know what...

302
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:19,207
Of course you do.

303
00:58:22,289 --> 00:58:25,656
Why did you punish the young couple

304
00:58:26,359 --> 00:58:28,589
in Nogodan, Captain?

305
00:58:28,662 --> 00:58:33,895
That's because of their love affair.

306
00:58:35,068 --> 00:58:39,596
You put their affairs onto Party's judgment,

307
00:58:39,673 --> 00:58:41,800
but you are fine with that?

308
00:58:47,147 --> 00:58:51,516
That's why there's a secret.
My work is absolute secret.

309
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:57,783
You should know the secret relationship
can't be conflicted with Party's rules.

310
00:58:58,825 --> 00:59:03,194
Is that so? Huh!
I don't understand.

311
00:59:04,531 --> 00:59:07,625
I can absolutely obey the order
from the party.

312
00:59:08,735 --> 00:59:11,670
Ae-ran! Ae-ran is my secretary.

313
00:59:12,806 --> 00:59:15,400
Of course you should
be connected with captain.

314
00:59:15,475 --> 00:59:16,942
Why are you doing this?
Let go...

315
00:59:22,716 --> 00:59:23,808
I can't.

316
00:59:23,883 --> 00:59:26,545
I, a partisan only work for the Party.

317
00:59:27,787 --> 00:59:33,817
Hey Ae-ran... what a bitch!

318
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:55,870
You seem like a poet in a fairyland.

319
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:01,847
What?

320
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:05,322
You don't need to be mad.

321
01:00:12,932 --> 01:00:14,900
What're you thinking?

322
01:00:17,337 --> 01:00:22,604
You're just looking at the mountain.
You must miss someone.

323
01:00:25,278 --> 01:00:26,711
You must miss a woman!

324
01:00:32,018 --> 01:00:35,215
What's that for?
You don't need to hide your nature.

325
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:51,467
It's dangerous a partisan has a thought.

326
01:00:51,538 --> 01:00:55,497
That would be a fatigue of an intelligent.

327
01:00:57,010 --> 01:01:00,104
What?
What did you just say?

328
01:01:06,319 --> 01:01:09,015
Chul-soo, are you upset?

329
01:01:09,689 --> 01:01:11,816
I didn't mean that seriously.

330
01:01:11,891 --> 01:01:12,789
Stop it.

331
01:01:14,027 --> 01:01:17,724
I became a partisan cursing my social class

332
01:01:17,797 --> 01:01:19,526
and working hard for the party for 3 years.

333
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:25,762
Forgive me.
I raked up unpleasant old stories.

334
01:01:28,374 --> 01:01:30,205
By the way,
what were you thinking?

335
01:01:32,078 --> 01:01:34,137
Is it a secret you can't tell?

336
01:01:48,127 --> 01:01:49,822
It must be a secret.

337
01:02:09,782 --> 01:02:13,240
Don't... why are you
so cautious of me?

338
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:22,594
Ah, how free those clouds are!

339
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:57,960
Comrade

340
01:03:01,868 --> 01:03:03,199
you were lucky today.

341
01:03:04,137 --> 01:03:06,628
You should be careful with your words.

342
01:03:07,574 --> 01:03:10,168
I was close to ll-dong,
and scared to get an attention for that.

343
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:13,007
Many go out for Wool
and come home shorn.

344
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:20,417
I didn't know that.
I'm still shuddering

345
01:03:20,486 --> 01:03:21,783
let's not talk about it.

346
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:25,855
Ah, Comrade Chul-soo also...

347
01:03:25,925 --> 01:03:27,722
Huh? Why?

348
01:03:28,561 --> 01:03:31,359
No, well he might be...

349
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:50,549
Did he do something with Ae-ran?

350
01:03:50,617 --> 01:03:53,017
We'll see how Captain treats him.

351
01:06:52,365 --> 01:06:55,493
Comrade, Soju,
what're you doing here?

352
01:07:01,507 --> 01:07:04,943
It's terrible!
The enemy starts to attack.

353
01:07:05,545 --> 01:07:09,413
Chief Captain has already died...

354
01:07:11,984 --> 01:07:17,445
What? The main office
has been defeated?

355
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:22,952
Yes, Piagol is now destroyed.

356
01:07:38,578 --> 01:07:43,345
Piagol is now over.

357
01:08:11,644 --> 01:08:18,345
Comrade Soju, let's go to the base.
You should report to Captain.

358
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:37,885
Captain, comrade Soju has...died.

359
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:41,422
What?
What happened to Soju?

360
01:14:42,568 --> 01:14:48,529
Yes, yes...beside the stream down
there...who...did...some

361
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:50,675
Speak straightly.

362
01:14:51,777 --> 01:14:53,210
She's d...ead.

363
01:15:17,002 --> 01:15:21,666
How did you find Soju was dead?

364
01:15:28,414 --> 01:15:31,406
I was doing laundry and
woman's underwear was drifted.

365
01:15:32,818 --> 01:15:33,910
Underwear?

366
01:15:34,586 --> 01:15:40,286
Yes, yes, this is...

367
01:15:42,094 --> 01:15:45,962
Did you see Soju coming, did you?

368
01:15:46,632 --> 01:15:49,931
No... not at all.

369
01:16:05,417 --> 01:16:07,044
It's strange.

370
01:16:10,122 --> 01:16:12,784
A dead body couldn'tjust come here.

371
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:15,256
Yes.

372
01:16:26,805 --> 01:16:29,774
Let's go find the truth.

373
01:17:10,682 --> 01:17:13,549
Who would've done this to Soju?

374
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:20,683
How should I know?

375
01:17:25,264 --> 01:17:29,633
She's shot and walked here...
that was terrible.

376
01:17:33,272 --> 01:17:35,240
Dal-suk should know it.

377
01:17:37,743 --> 01:17:40,211
Do you really think so?

378
01:17:41,313 --> 01:17:46,410
There's no evidence,
but it's Dal-suk who found Soju first.

379
01:17:50,522 --> 01:17:51,614
I don't think so...

380
01:17:52,291 --> 01:17:53,019
What?

381
01:18:05,437 --> 01:18:06,267
Then?

382
01:18:15,047 --> 01:18:15,979
Comrade!

383
01:18:20,619 --> 01:18:24,919
I can keep your secret.

384
01:18:46,578 --> 01:18:49,638
Huhu... that's why I like you...

385
01:18:58,090 --> 01:19:00,752
You're choking me!

386
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:49,463
Let go!

387
01:21:15,894 --> 01:21:16,826
You'll regret this.

388
01:21:35,147 --> 01:21:36,580
Comrade, what is it?

389
01:21:49,695 --> 01:21:53,358
Dal-suk cut his throat.

390
01:21:54,166 --> 01:21:57,829
Dal-suk did?

391
01:22:06,645 --> 01:22:09,375
Right, it's him who killed Soju.

392
01:22:09,448 --> 01:22:10,107
Yes.

393
01:22:10,182 --> 01:22:13,640
Man-soo! Leave it here
and hurry to get him...

394
01:22:17,189 --> 01:22:17,848
Yes, sir.

395
01:23:55,153 --> 01:23:57,280
What're you doing here alone?

396
01:23:57,355 --> 01:24:00,153
Yoo-chul told me to come with you.

397
01:24:03,895 --> 01:24:04,691
Let's hurry.

398
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:10,459
Yoo-chul? Why?

399
01:24:20,045 --> 01:24:24,880
A pheasant...

400
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:32,083
right, he's got a pheasant...
he's baking it now alone.

401
01:24:34,826 --> 01:24:35,724
Is that so?

402
01:24:57,148 --> 01:24:59,514
How did he catch it?
Did he shoot?

403
01:24:59,584 --> 01:25:01,484
He knocked it with a gun stock.

404
01:25:05,523 --> 01:25:06,387
With a gun stock?

405
01:25:10,996 --> 01:25:12,361
Like this...

406
01:25:32,350 --> 01:25:33,078
Captain,

407
01:25:36,021 --> 01:25:38,683
well... Dal-suk tried to rebel

408
01:25:39,324 --> 01:25:40,484
even against me, his friend

409
01:25:42,527 --> 01:25:44,825
What did he do?
Why isn't he coming?

410
01:25:45,530 --> 01:25:49,261
ln fact, I told him to come to Captain,

411
01:25:49,334 --> 01:25:53,600
but suddenly he tried to
shoot me on the chest.

412
01:25:54,306 --> 01:26:00,211
So I tried to beat him
but I curved and put it forth.

413
01:26:01,046 --> 01:26:05,915
Forgive me. He was a nice buddy.

414
01:26:11,423 --> 01:26:14,187
All right! He was mad to death.

415
01:26:14,926 --> 01:26:17,520
Otherwise,
he could've been dead by me.

416
01:26:18,029 --> 01:26:20,623
Man-soo, you took the trouble.

417
01:26:36,047 --> 01:26:42,111
It's a pity our number's decreasing
but he was a reactionary.

418
01:26:43,588 --> 01:26:44,577
You are right, sir.

419
01:27:30,168 --> 01:27:32,932
Today's destination is Osanli village?

420
01:27:37,942 --> 01:27:38,806
Well.

421
01:27:44,449 --> 01:27:50,149
Namsanli and Osanli, we always go to 'li'.

422
01:27:51,856 --> 01:27:54,916
There's no other way for people
to live and die in mountains

423
01:27:54,993 --> 01:27:58,190
and they'll go to hell.

424
01:27:59,397 --> 01:28:00,364
To hell?

425
01:28:01,366 --> 01:28:04,858
Why, of course!
Do you think they're going to the heaven?

426
01:28:06,237 --> 01:28:08,137
Have you seen hell?

427
01:28:09,441 --> 01:28:15,107
The foresight you mentioned
before just came into being to me.

428
01:28:16,314 --> 01:28:20,011
To see the light from the dark.

429
01:28:33,098 --> 01:28:34,565
Comrade Chul-soo,

430
01:28:41,739 --> 01:28:43,969
I don't want to go on
supply fight today.

431
01:28:44,742 --> 01:28:48,200
Please tell Captain for me.

432
01:28:48,279 --> 01:28:49,940
I am not well.

433
01:28:55,553 --> 01:28:56,542
I don't know.

434
01:28:58,289 --> 01:29:02,623
You'd rather tell Captain instead of me.

435
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:05,353
You're his secretary.

436
01:29:07,932 --> 01:29:09,729
Secretary?

437
01:29:14,806 --> 01:29:17,673
Do you think I am connected
with Captain for that?

438
01:29:31,289 --> 01:29:35,191
Why are you so cautious of me?

439
01:29:37,228 --> 01:29:39,128
You're always cold to me,

440
01:29:40,965 --> 01:29:44,366
but does it prove your innocence?

441
01:29:47,138 --> 01:29:48,833
I don't know what you're saying.

442
01:29:50,975 --> 01:29:52,840
Blaming my deeds?

443
01:29:54,212 --> 01:30:00,208
You're afraid of me.
You don't need to hate me.

444
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,915
What do you mean I hate you?

445
01:30:15,233 --> 01:30:23,868
I've already lost my humanity.

446
01:30:24,709 --> 01:30:27,974
Not to speak of me now

447
01:30:57,942 --> 01:31:00,911
Dong-cho, Dong-cho...

448
01:31:00,979 --> 01:31:01,741
Yes, sir.

449
01:31:03,281 --> 01:31:04,179
Why don't they come?

450
01:31:06,251 --> 01:31:10,449
Yes. Ae-ran went to the waterfall
with Chul-soo a while ago.

451
01:31:11,222 --> 01:31:12,120
Call them now!

452
01:31:22,166 --> 01:31:25,158
I'm concerned about you.

453
01:31:25,803 --> 01:31:29,500
Your lonely face weighs on my mind.

454
01:31:31,409 --> 01:31:33,172
I don't want sympathy of woman.

455
01:31:34,479 --> 01:31:36,447
Anyhow, I resent myself,

456
01:31:36,514 --> 01:31:39,449
and your words worsen my situation.

457
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:45,081
Comrades, Captain's calling you.

458
01:40:14,565 --> 01:40:18,228
Would you not go down to the village, comrade?

459
01:40:27,812 --> 01:40:29,439
I know it well.

460
01:40:31,982 --> 01:40:35,315
They'll save your life upon surrendering.

461
01:40:38,889 --> 01:40:40,618
I didn't know you would say that.

462
01:40:44,962 --> 01:40:46,759
I'm a human being,

463
01:40:53,904 --> 01:40:54,768
Ae-ran,

464
01:41:09,019 --> 01:41:10,350
thank you.

465
01:41:19,029 --> 01:41:22,726
Ae-ran, have you ever
thought of our destiny?

466
01:41:36,213 --> 01:41:40,445
ln this harsh mountain,
in this valley like hell,

467
01:41:41,085 --> 01:41:46,614
cursing this situation,
is it only me who is dying in here?

468
01:41:47,825 --> 01:41:50,885
Ae-ran, so are you?

469
01:42:00,504 --> 01:42:05,305
I'm sick and tired with this life in the mountains.

470
01:42:06,844 --> 01:42:10,473
Let's get out of this hell.

471
01:42:12,783 --> 01:42:18,050
I'm an old and sinned girl,

472
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:23,656
and there's no hometown,
even if I leave this mountain.

473
01:42:25,863 --> 01:42:30,630
I'd be dead after being chased,
escaping from Piagol.

474
01:42:44,615 --> 01:42:48,676
But, there's one thing...

475
01:42:55,025 --> 01:42:56,890
it's nothing,

476
01:42:58,329 --> 01:43:09,706
but my life of youth still cuts to the heart.

477
01:45:57,341 --> 01:45:59,172
<i>The certificate of Service Medal.</i>

478
01:48:12,776 --> 01:48:14,607
<i>The end</i>
