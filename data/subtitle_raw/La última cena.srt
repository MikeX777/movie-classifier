1
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,240
Right, Maria… Toni, over there, okay.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,920
- Over there.
- And… keep still.

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,520
Frame.

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,960
We'll wait five seconds in black.

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,520
Action.

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,520
THE ARRIVAL

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,840
Hey there! Hi, how are you?

8
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,720
- Fine.
- How's it going?

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,080
- Fine, and you?
- Great.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,000
Hi!

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,160
- Hi, darling. It's good to see you, honey!
- Hey, Alejandro, you're looking good.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,240
I haven't seen you in ages. How's things?
Every time I come, it's like…

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,400
- It's the tops.
- Long time no see.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,920
- Well, a couple of months.
- Where shall I leave this?

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,640
- I'll take it into the other room.
- Two months, since the last dinner party?

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,760
- The dinner we had…
- Hey, that Gallardo bag!

17
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,920
- I'll keep hold of it.
- The one we had here.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,680
- I don't trust your husband.
- Has it really been two months?

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,920
- Yeah, it's been two months.
- Here, take this.

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,120
- Hey, fantastic, thanks.
- Thanks.

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,320
- Do you fancy a drink? Wine?
- The nancy boy...

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,240
- Here take this.
- The nancy boy brought a bottle of marc.

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,400
What have you brought?

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,856
- You jackass.
- What have you brought?

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,000
- Me?
- You've brought something, right?

26
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,120
- Don't play around, you know.
- Hang on, come here.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,800
- Come here.
- Right.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,400
- So, how are you?
- Fine.

29
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,720
- Fine?
- What about you? It's been ages.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,120
He's… Tell them.

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,120
- What's happened?
- He's pulled.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,080
- What?
- He has a rod this big.

33
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,000
- No.
- What?

34
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,280
- A huge dick this big.
- Not yet.

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,280
- It's not true. Not yet. I wish I had…
- Where did you meet him?

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,360
- He's turned romantic now, you know?
- Well…

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,600
Through an app.

38
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,840
- What's it called?
- Well, one...

39
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,120
- Grindr.
- No, I mean…

40
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,000
- the guy with the big dick.
- Alberto. What difference does it make?

41
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,720
- What nonsense. You're so silly.
- Why?

42
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,360
- What's the big deal?
- Leave him alone.

43
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,560
- Alright, it's cool.
- Watch it.

44
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,720
Lorena's coming with her new boyfriend.

45
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,360
- Did you know about him or not?
- Yes.

46
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,600
And...

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,640
- Don't be a bitch, babe.
- Why, what's up?

48
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,480
No, it's fine.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,960
He's an older guy, a meteorologist.
What a picture!

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,440
- Seriously?
- How old is he?

51
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,840
- No idea.
- Really old?

52
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,840
- I think he's in his fifties.
- How old though?

53
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,440
Dude, the usual, Lorena's type,
Lorena likes older guys.

54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,760
- You're such a nag.
- She's always with older guys.

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,920
The last guy she was with…
I think he was retired.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
- Retired? This guy?
- No, the guy she was with before.

57
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,360
- Seriously?
- Lorena always goes for older guys.

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,560
Where's my mobile?

59
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,800
- I can't make Lorena out.
- Really?

60
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,120
No, I just can't… Well…

61
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I can't make her out.

62
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,200
Is that my mobile?

63
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,200
You must come to my new restaurant.

64
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,080
Let's do a selfie.

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,640
- Where is it?
- In Chueca.

66
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,880
- What's it called?
- El Intruso, it's fabulous.

67
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,760
- Tell me about the menu.
- No, no way,

68
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,120
- come and try it.
- Honey.

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,000
No, hang on, I'm blurred.

70
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,400
- Another.
- Your husband is an asshole.

71
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,120
- Hey, why?
- He's an asshole.

72
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,040
Shut up.

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,320
- No, I'm joking.
- Look at the camera, it's for Instagram.

74
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll go, Maria.

75
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,280
- I've no idea.
- Hi!

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,000
What's up, dudes?

77
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,360
- Look at you!
- You're looking good.

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,760
How you doing?

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,480
- How you doing, bro?
- I'm good.

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,400
Hi!

81
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,440
- Hey, dude!
- Hi, gorgeous.

82
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,040
- How are you?
- Good, and you?

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
- Hi.
- What's up?

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,280
- How you doing?
- Great.

85
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,640
I didn't bring anything in the end.

86
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,160
- Hi there.
- Nothing at all?

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,240
You're looking good.

88
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,120
- Here, give me your coat.
- Yeah, sure.

89
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,160
Didn't you bring your guitar, Carlos?

90
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,000
No, but Toni's got one.

91
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,000
- We've got one.
- Cool.

92
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,120
- How's things?
- Good.

93
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
- Can you get me a drink?
- Sure, what do you fancy?

94
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,320
You got beer?

95
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,040
- Beer? Sure.
- Yes, please.

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,120
How you doing?

97
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,840
- Fine.
- Are you doing gigs and stuff?

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,560
We're putting a new record together
and things are going a bit slow.

99
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,640
We've both got different jobs
because we can't live off music.

100
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,200
We must go to a Jevi gig.

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
- We really must go to a Jevi gig.
- No way.

102
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,959
- With a J.
- You're great.

103
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,279
We're not heavies, you know.

104
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,680
I know, it's just the name "Jevi's,"
but it's really cool.

105
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,880
It's a great group.

106
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,120
- What's up?
- Nothing, it just makes me laugh.

107
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,000
- The thing about Jevi with a J.
- And with an I.

108
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,960
It's like Levi's, but Jevi's.

109
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,040
No, I mean, I've heard some of your stuff
and it sounds a bit like…

110
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,160
a bit like country, right?

111
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,480
I mean, a bit more
and you'll be playing folk music!

112
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,480
Well, you have to add
a bit of humor to music.

113
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,040
It's about having fun.

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,560
If we don't have much time to do it

115
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,840
and we don't make any money from it,

116
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,400
- at least we have some fun.
- I love the lyrics.

117
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,200
- They're funny.
- They're great.

118
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,920
- I don't smoke anymore.
- Good on you.

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,376
- I need to give it up.
- What's that?

120
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,800
It's vaping.

121
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Since when?

122
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,560
Do you fancy it now with a glass of wine?

123
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,760
Do you fancy a beer or something? Carlos?

124
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,280
Sorry? I've got one.

125
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,680
- Can you get me another, hon?
- Sure.

126
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,560
Have you got a glass?

127
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,480
- Whose is this wine? Yours, Maria?
- I've got a glass.

128
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,600
It's mine. Drink it.

129
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I swear, I can't cope with Carlos.

130
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,000
Why not? You get on well with him.

131
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,360
Maria, you know we hooked up, right?

132
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,400
What? You never told me.
I can't believe it.

133
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,120
You didn't know we hooked up?

134
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,320
Well, you told me
you stayed up late and so on,

135
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,280
but you never mentioned hooking up.
I mean, you shagged?

136
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,160
- Yes, Maria, we've shagged several times.
- I don't believe it.

137
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,280
- Several times.
- You what?

138
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
I get really…

139
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,080
What are you on about?

140
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,920
- What have I touched?
- I don't think Toni knows.

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,480
Don't say a word to Toni.

142
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,080
- Not one word.
- Okay.

143
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,960
- No, honestly.
- He shags around, honey.

144
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,520
- No, but… I shag around too.
- Sure.

145
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,000
I know your husband, he's a big mouth.

146
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,920
Gym was my favorite subject, you know.

147
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,400
Is it politically incorrect to say "gym"
in the field of sports science?

148
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,800
Or do you have to say
"physical education"?

149
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,120
Yes, it's politically incorrect.

150
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,720
I mean, you should say
"physical education."

151
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,520
I mean, the name is
"physical education," not "gym."

152
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,720
But you can say "gym," you know.
My pupils say, "Let's go to gym."

153
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,840
- Maria, I've been out and about all day.
- I was dying to see you.

154
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,120
- It's so good to see you.
- I'm sorry.

155
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
- Hell, it's been such a long time.
- I've got something for you.

156
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,320
- Sorry?
- I've got something you might like.

157
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,360
- What is it?
- I'll show it to you in a minute.

158
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,400
Someone's here.

159
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,960
Who's coming?

160
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,760
Lore?

161
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,480
- Hey, Maria!
- Hey!

162
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,600
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

163
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,320
- I couldn't wait to see you.
- Me too, darling.

164
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
- How are you?
- Good. Come in.

165
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetie.

166
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,480
- How are you?
- Fine, and you?

167
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,920
- I'm good, and you?
- Good.

168
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,080
It's lovely and warm in here.

169
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,960
- I guess it's cold out.
- A bit. I've brought some wine.

170
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,400
- Hey, how nice!
- A bottle of wine and a loaf of bread.

171
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,160
A loaf of bread? Great.

172
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,160
- Toni.
- Carles.

173
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,120
- How are you?
- Fine.

174
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,600
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

175
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,840
- How you doing?
- Good.

176
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,720
- Lore says it's cold outside.
- I can't remember…

177
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,120
- Toni.
- Right, Toni.

178
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,520
Carles, sorry, I haven't introduced you.

179
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,400
- Hello, I'm Carlos. Easy to remember.
- Carles.

180
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,760
Right, this is Toni, Alex and Marta.

181
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,080
- How you doing?
- Good.

182
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,480
Give me your coat.

183
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,800
- Sure.
- I'll hang it up.

184
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,560
- I'm fine, and you?
- Fine.

185
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,040
You're all looking good.

186
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,400
- How's things?
- Your coat.

187
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,640
Yeah, sure.

188
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
I'll keep my bag with me,
it's got my ciggies…

189
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,640
- You must take a look, I've got...
- Well…

190
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
- Seriously, it hurts.
- Carles, have a seat.

191
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,720
- What about your bag?
- I'll leave it over here, for my ciggies.

192
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,760
- You're Alex, right?
- Yes. Alex.

193
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Well then…

194
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,200
- My word!
- I know.

195
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,280
Well, don't think about it now, relax.
Does it hurt?

196
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,360
- Yeah, it's really sore.
- Don't worry.

197
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,600
Leave it for now,
but you must come and see me.

198
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,640
Give me a call, get an appointment
and I'll see to you.

199
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,080
Sure, I want you to give me
a full checkup and cleaning.

200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
I'll do the whole lot.

201
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,920
- Don't worry.
- Are you a dentist?

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,520
No, I'm a patient.

203
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,679
A patient! Right.

204
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,200
How's it going with this guy?

205
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,640
He's unbelievable.
You saw the bag he brought, right?

206
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,440
- So what? It's only natural.
- I was a bit embarrassed.

207
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,159
- Whatever for?
- Well, I saw him,

208
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,520
he turned up with a plastic bag,
with a loaf of bread.

209
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,120
He brought a loaf of bread, I swear.

210
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,520
- It looks delicious, babe.
- It's really nice.

211
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,280
The plastic bag though, hon.
I was a bit embarrassed, Maria.

212
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,520
- I didn't know where to hide.
- What? Nonsense. Don't be silly.

213
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,160
- It's a super loaf though.
- Good heavens!

214
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
- He's so cute.
- Delightful. Ideal.

215
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,440
He's really cute.

216
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,400
Carles, thanks for the loaf.

217
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,440
It's a Galician-style loaf of bread,
from the local baker's.

218
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,240
They make good ones and I thought,
well, it might seem a bit…

219
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,400
I love it.

220
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,640
- …tacky, but still…
- Not at all.

221
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
- Are you from Valencia?
- Yes.

222
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,200
So am I.

223
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,120
- Both from Valencia.
- Whereabouts?

224
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,840
- I'm from Moncada.
- Moncada?

225
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,920
- A town near Valencia. You heard of it?
- Moncada, sure.

226
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,440
- Where are you from?
- Gandia.

227
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
- Gandia? Cool.
- Yes.

228
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,520
But then I went to Alcira
and then I moved to Valencia.

229
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,160
- Right.
- There's a lot of vice in Moncada, right?

230
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
- Vice?
- Miami… Moncada. Moncada Vice.

231
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,240
Sorry.

232
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,480
- No, carry on.
- I'm sorry.

233
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,360
- Carry on.
- Sorry, it was a joke.

234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,160
- The thing is...
- No, it sounded like…

235
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,080
No, with the People's Party,
there's a lot of corruption, so they say.

236
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,000
- You're right.
- That's what you meant.

237
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
- Right, Carles?
- Loads.

238
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Hang on,
do we have to talk about this now?

239
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
About what?

240
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,720
- About what?
- Have you read the news today?

241
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,520
- What the…
- Well…

242
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,760
- It makes me laugh.
- I'll tell you about it.

243
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,440
I'll tell you about it.

244
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,160
Can we smoke? Shall we smoke?
Yeah? Are we allowed?

245
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,280
Right then…

246
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,640
There's no problem because I'm innocent.

247
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,760
- Innocent?
- Innocent of what?

248
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,800
Look, news came out today
stating accusations against me.

249
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,680
- What?
- Accusations have been brought against me.

250
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,880
I face an accusation of embezzlement,
corrupt practice,

251
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:39,400
several invoices have come to light
which are under my name,

252
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,880
but it's…
Look, it's an architect who wants my job.

253
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,160
- Okay?
- An architect...

254
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,720
- He's after my job.
- Toni works...

255
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,480
I work as an architect
at city hall in Parla.

256
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,000
Anyway, it was in the press today

257
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:55,480
that I face accusations
of embezzlement and corrupt practice.

258
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,200
But I'm innocent. Everything's alright.
The invoices are fake.

259
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,840
It's just a matter of…

260
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,800
It's a hate campaign against me.

261
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,520
- Have others been accused, or just you?
- It's an individual.

262
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,680
It's an architect who's after my job.

263
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,680
- But you...
- It's not related to any…

264
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,960
It's none of my business.

265
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:16,440
Some building work we did on the roof
for a bullring. Don't laugh, Marta.

266
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,360
Don't laugh, it's the roof for a bullring.

267
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,680
Hang on a minute,
how come you knew about it?

268
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,720
- I read about it.
- Where? Where has it been...

269
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,640
It was in El País today.

270
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,280
But I'm not worried, honestly.
It's all untrue. Everything's fine.

271
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,080
Nothing will come of it.

272
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,440
What could happen to you?

273
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,720
- What could happen?
- Toni, explain it properly.

274
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,640
You know what it's all about.

275
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,520
Well, the thing is,
we did some construction work,

276
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,200
the roofing on the bullring in Parla.

277
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,400
It was three years ago.
Anyway, there were extra costs,

278
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,400
and they have used
those extra costs to say

279
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,800
that I had issued invoices to the company
that had been awarded the building work.

280
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,440
Well, it's the typical thing,
it's a really common case. I mean…

281
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,200
- Yeah, really common.
- You bet.

282
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,440
Especially in Valencia.

283
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,160
I think the water you drink in Valencia
must have some chemical component

284
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,400
that makes you all fucking corrupt.

285
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,880
Marta, honey,
your jokes are getting on my nerves, okay?

286
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,600
It's an accusation, I mean…

287
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,480
- there's no problem.
- I'm not so sure.

288
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,120
For something like that
to be in the press…

289
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,840
- Maria.
- No, honestly, I'm not worried.

290
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,360
- Forgive me.
- It's okay, honey.

291
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,600
- You know what I'm like.
- I just want us all to support him today.

292
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,240
It's alright, honestly, I'm not worried
and that's what really matters.

293
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,920
Don't worry, everything's fine.

294
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,960
- If you're fine about it…
- I'm fine, I'm cool.

295
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,840
- Did you read it this morning?
- Is that why you're smoking?

296
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,040
- I guess so. Among other things.
- Can someone open this bottle? I can't.

297
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,240
- I don't know where the corkscrews are.
- I'll do it.

298
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,040
- I can do it.
- It's okay, he'll do it.

299
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,320
Toni, nothing like this
has ever happened to you.

300
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,680
No, never. It's all a bit crazy.

301
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,120
I mean, the invoices,
it's all a bit bizarre.

302
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,880
The post will be up for grabs next year
and it's a much sought-after post.

303
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,120
Of course.

304
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,200
- But…
- Toni has his studio downstairs.

305
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:11,040
I know what projects he's working on
and he's never mentioned

306
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,760
any kitchen whatsoever,
Toni doesn't do kitchens.

307
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
- I did this one.
- And it's beautiful.

308
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,600
We're talking about prison sentences.
Go to hell, you know?

309
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,320
I'm as left-wing as you can get.

310
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,520
You're left-wing,
but your parents aren't much.

311
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,400
- So what, honey?
- Toni's parents aren't left-wing either.

312
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,080
What does that have to do with it?

313
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,920
- It's me, Toni.
- Sorry, Carles,

314
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,680
this is the first time you've met us.

315
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,040
- All this gets me kind of…
- Tell us about yourself.

316
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,880
Yeah, come on,
tell us about yourself, Carles.

317
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,720
- What do you do?
- Now he'll say he's a politician.

318
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,160
- "An architect at city hall in Parla."
- I'm…

319
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,760
I'm going to get your job.

320
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,360
- No, seriously.
- What do you do, Carles?

321
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
Well,

322
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,760
- I'm...
- Apart from looking after our friend.

323
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,400
- You okay, Carles?
- Yes.

324
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,200
- Don't hassle him.
- Meteorologist.

325
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,200
Meteorologist?

326
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,000
Meteorologist?

327
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,160
- Sorry.
- Marta finds everything funny.

328
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,680
- I find everything funny.
- Yeah, I realized that.

329
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,280
Well, at least you know…

330
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,400
- Everything's going well, I think.
- Everything is fine. How are you?

331
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,760
- Well, I was a bit worried...
- No, I'm fine. Maria, everything's fine.

332
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,840
- I know, but… who knows?
- I wanted this to come about like this.

333
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,800
To specialize,
you have to study atmospheric science,

334
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,120
- which is an extra year.
- Which university?

335
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,200
- Madrid.
- Sorry?

336
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,200
In Madrid.
You can only study in Madrid or Barcelona.

337
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,280
That branch.

338
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,520
But anyway,
it's a degree course like any other,

339
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,240
- but it depends on physics, that's all.
- No, I'm sure.

340
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,600
- I've never met a meteorologist.
- Everyone thinks it's those people on TV.

341
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,880
- The weatherman.
- Weren't you…

342
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,920
No, I worked in television
for a year and I quit.

343
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,280
- Were you on the news?
- Yes.

344
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,320
Regional TV.

345
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,960
- Canal Nou.
- For a year.

346
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,880
But I got fed up and left.
Before they closed down.

347
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,000
A bit of music? No, Maria isn't keen.

348
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,600
- There won't be a raid here tonight, huh?
- I hope not.

349
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,040
If you have anything to hide, hide it now.

350
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,600
I'd love it if there was a raid. You bet.

351
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,360
- Me too.
- Why? For a bit of action?

352
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,280
- Of course! They suddenly barge in...
- Hey, listen,

353
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,800
I'm falling for your guy, he's great.

354
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:34,400
- He wants a raid.
- Me too. I love raids. I love the cops.

355
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,520
- They can sit down for dinner, no worries.
- Great, sure.

356
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,240
Sure, and they can search.

357
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,680
Well, they won't find much here.

358
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,600
They'll find Birro.

359
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,960
- What?
- I was looking forward to having a drink.

360
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Birro!

361
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,400
You okay? Birro, come here. Birro.

362
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,680
I've brought some weed. From our club.

363
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,240
- I haven't smoked in ages.
- Come on, a bit today.

364
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I need it, after the day I've had today,
it's been a really tough day.

365
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,760
- How many followers have you got?
- About 130,000. Don't you follow me?

366
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,040
- I can't remember how many you've got.
- Behind Carlos. Here.

367
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Instagrammer?

368
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,200
- Yes.
- She's at it all the time,

369
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,360
- taking videos and photos all the time.
- I catch you looking gorgeous, dammit.

370
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,880
You do, sweetie, but sometimes it's like,
"Maria, leave it out…"

371
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,800
She does it well.

372
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,480
- She doesn't do it tacky…
- No, not at all, I love it.

373
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,760
It might be a good idea
not to post too many things tonight.

374
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,640
The day he gets an accusation
brought against him, he's seen partying,

375
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
tell me about it.

376
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,920
Yeah, exactly.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,920
I've known this would happen
for two weeks now.

378
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,680
The news came out today,
but I knew about this two weeks ago.

379
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,240
The news about Greta came as a shock.
Today is a fucking day for mourning.

380
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,600
Haven't you read about it?

381
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,280
- I have.
- No, read the news.

382
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,400
Lorena, Greta Thunberg has been murdered.

383
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,319
- She was murdered...
- Search it.

384
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,416
- Has no one read it?
- I haven't read the news today,

385
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,920
I haven't heard a damn thing.

386
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,560
I know nothing at all.

387
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,680
I came through the door and found out
that Toni has accusations against him.

388
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,920
I haven't read anything,

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,440
with the shit day I've had.
What are you on about?

390
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,800
- Did you know about Greta Thunberg?
- Of course.

391
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,560
I don't believe it.

392
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,920
- I swear.
- On Twitter, worldwide.

393
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,440
No way, it's unbelievable, honestly.

394
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,400
- It's her parents' fault.
- Exactly, I'd kill her parents.

395
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,160
- What are you on about?
- I'd kill her fucking parents.

396
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,000
Not her parents, it's a social problem,
if she's been killed.

397
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,760
What do you mean, her parents?
Her parents?

398
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,720
- Do you consider her incompetent?
- If I had a child,

399
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,680
which I don't and I never will,

400
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
- thanks to the universe...
- Hey, listen,

401
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,440
- this girl...
- She's 16, you know.

402
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,920
- She isn't a kid.
- She started out really young.

403
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,880
- She started when she was 14, Marta.
- She didn't do the same things.

404
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,720
If my kid tells me she's going to fight
for the universe on Fridays,

405
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
- I'd thrash her and tell her to study.
- Marta, babe,

406
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,560
what are you on about?
A girl that has stood up every Friday

407
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,640
and dared to say things
that grown-ups haven't dared to say.

408
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:07,440
- Can I say it here with my friends or not?
- She's right.

409
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,480
- Of course you can.
- Come on, man.

410
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,920
THE DINNER

411
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,560
- It's really hot now.
- It's giving off a lot of heat.

412
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,840
- Can someone tell me how it works?
- I can't, it's new.

413
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,560
- Marta, you.
- How it works? Sure.

414
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,840
Please, tell us.

415
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,840
You put the cheese in these things, okay?

416
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,240
In these things.
The cheese melts, like a sauce.

417
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:34,080
You can put the accompaniments, the eggs,
potatoes, et cetera, on your plate.

418
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,240
And everything that can be cooked,
the leeks, tomatoes and so on,

419
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,680
goes on there.

420
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:43,040
- The quail eggs are so cute!
- The eggs on here?

421
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,560
It's really strong, don't mix it much,
put it over this side.

422
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,600
Otherwise it gets too strong.

423
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,240
- I'll make it up.
- Pass me the oil.

424
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,280
- I think we can add a splash here, right?
- Yeah.

425
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,840
The potato is great, it forms a coating.
I'd eat a lot of potato if I were you.

426
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,680
- Delicious.
- Aren't you having any?

427
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,240
Carles, aren't you going to eat?

428
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,960
- This is wonderful.
- I'm not really hungry.

429
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
Let me try.

430
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,560
Do you mind taking your mobile and this
off the table? It's just that…

431
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,560
- you know, I don't like it.
- No, please. A photo before we start!

432
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
- Maria, don't post anything.
- Why not?

433
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,040
I'd rather you didn't post anything today.

434
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,400
- That won't be the police, will it?
- No, man.

435
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,880
- I hope not.
- Why would it be the police?

436
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
- Maria.
- Amparo.

437
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,080
- What's up, honey?
- Let me come in.

438
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,880
- Sure.
- Sorry, I know you've got guests.

439
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,000
No worries.

440
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,600
- I need to tell you something.
- What's up?

441
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,360
I've brought you a cake.

442
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,120
- Please forgive me, I'm sorry.
- Hi, Amparo.

443
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,240
- Hello.
- How are you?

444
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,560
Hello, Antonio.

445
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,720
She calls me Antonio.

446
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,800
- Are you alright?
- I'm not too good.

447
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,960
- Really?
- This is a tiramisu I've made.

448
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,080
Delicious! Why though?

449
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,000
- It's for you.
- There was no need, but thank you, dear.

450
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,200
- Come out onto the terrace with me.
- Listen, this is Amparo.

451
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,400
I've brought a dessert,
I'm on a diet and I can't eat it.

452
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,840
- What dessert is it?
- Tiramisu.

453
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,400
- Did you know we had guests to dinner?
- We met at the supermarket this morning,

454
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,520
but I make this dessert
every year on the same day.

455
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,680
I have to,
but I can't eat it, I'm on a diet.

456
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,080
Thank you very much.

457
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,840
- Can we have a chat on the terrace?
- Sure.

458
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,360
- Carry on.
- Don't chat on the terrace.

459
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
Chat over there,
you'll freeze to death, it's cold out.

460
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,640
I'll tell you later.
I don't want to interrupt.

461
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,560
What's up?

462
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,320
- I can't go home, I have no electricity.
- It's gone off?

463
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,480
Shall I go over to your house
and check it out?

464
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,000
No, it's best to leave it
as it is right now.

465
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,240
That's why I wanted you to go outside
to see something, but never mind, later.

466
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,000
Amparo, stay a while.

467
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,120
Well, I could do
with something to drink actually.

468
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,360
- A drink?
- Man, you bet.

469
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:06,160
- Are you staying for dinner then, Amparo?
- No, good heavens, how embarrassing.

470
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
We're embarrassing?

471
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,520
It's the electricity.
I have no electricity right now.

472
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,920
But if you pour me some wine,
I'll have a drink.

473
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,240
How sweet.

474
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,400
This is like the accused,
his wife, the neighbor…

475
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,760
The accused, the neighbor,
his wife and other things, right?

476
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,280
- It was a film.
- An X-rated one.

477
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,200
- No.
- It sounds like an X-rated one.

478
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,320
- It's one of those films...
- Amparo.

479
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,160
- The accused…
- Sit here if you like.

480
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,120
- Toni, open this bottle, I'm hopeless.
- Sure.

481
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,200
Are you alright there?

482
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,080
- Do you live in a cottage too?
- I came as I was.

483
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:44,320
- You look lovely.
- I was about to say the same thing.

484
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
It's a bit of a special day for me.

485
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,160
Well, you look fabulous
considering you've come as you were.

486
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,120
Absolutely.

487
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,160
- White wine, Amparo?
- Yes, please.

488
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,160
Get another plate for Amparo, please.

489
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,360
- No, I'm not going to eat.
- Just a bit.

490
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,640
No, I'm on a diet.

491
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,160
- I'll get you a small plate.
- Are you on a diet, Amparo?

492
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,800
The quails eggs, for fuck's sake. Dammit.

493
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,440
Well, have you got any stain remover?
Toni.

494
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,000
- It's alright.
- What's the matter, Lorena, honey?

495
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,520
- It's alright!
- Don't hassle her.

496
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
- You're overacting a bit.
- Okay, it's alright.

497
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,720
- It's no problem, I've stained my dress.
- Okay, alright.

498
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,920
- Lorena has things to sort out.
- You're stressed out.

499
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,880
- Amparo…
- I saw you the minute I walked in.

500
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,920
- No way.
- You noticed it, right?

501
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,800
Yes, get it off your chest.

502
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,360
Seriously, Amparo's right,
I agree, get it off your chest.

503
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,400
- No.
- This is freaking me out.

504
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,280
- You have a special energy too.
- Energy, right?

505
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,200
Yes.

506
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,000
- I'll tell you what I've got at home.
- What have you got?

507
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,440
- I'm really intrigued.
- I've got people.

508
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,880
- Your husband?
- No, other people, from other worlds.

509
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,080
- Hey, I think we should drink a toast…
- And close the shutters.

510
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,720
- …to Amparo, because she's here.
- Thank you.

511
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,760
- To Lorena.
- To Lorena.

512
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,400
- Yeah, to Lorena, come on.
- To Carles.

513
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,800
- Cheer up, Lorena.
- To Alex, 'cause he's shagged.

514
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,720
No, not yet.

515
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,000
- Have you shagged?
- Yes.

516
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,880
No!

517
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,880
How romantic.

518
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
- No, I don't like you hassling me.
- Alex, cool it.

519
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,280
That's enough.

520
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,680
- Okay, cool it.
- Things are getting a bit intense tonight,

521
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,920
- let's all calm down a bit.
- Shall we go do some lines?

522
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,200
- Please...
- That's enough.

523
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
Sorry, it was a joke.

524
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,800
Well, Amparo, it wasn't a joke.
It wasn't, Marta.

525
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,360
We get together for dinner once a month.
Everything's fine.

526
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,600
Don't worry about me, Antonio, I...

527
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,640
- Amparo always calls me Antonio.
- Well, if you like, I can...

528
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,480
No, I love it.
My mum used to call me Antonio.

529
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,600
I sometimes hear people talking about you
and they call you Antonio.

530
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,560
Yeah.

531
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,720
Do you know what kids do these days
when something like this happens?

532
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,680
They go, "Boom!"

533
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,400
Kids these days go, "Boom!"
Yes, seriously.

534
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,520
- Like they're dropping a bomb.
- Well.

535
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:18,840
I'll tell you a joke.
One woman says to her friend,

536
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,960
"Honey..." Maria, for example.

537
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,200
"Maria, after 25 years of marriage,
would you marry your husband again?"

538
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,640
And she replies…

539
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,160
"Yes. Screw him."

540
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,120
That's a good one!

541
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
- Yeah.
- I like it.

542
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,560
- Screw him.
- Screw him.

543
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,280
- Yeah, screw him. Sure.
- Sure.

544
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,680
- Screw him.
- It's for heterosexuals with husbands.

545
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,080
Sorry, you're a widow.

546
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,800
- But I love that joke.
- Excuse me, I'm a widow…

547
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,520
- Exactly.
- …but I'm about to be reborn.

548
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,160
- Really?
- Yes.

549
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,640
- What do you mean, "about to be reborn"?
- Well, I'm on Tinder.

550
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,480
- Don't laugh.
- And he's on Grindr.

551
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,760
- My daughter got me on it.
- You're on Tinder?

552
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,760
- Boom!
- Boom!

553
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,080
Amparo is on Tinder.

554
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,000
What's wrong with being on Tinder?
There's nothing wrong with that.

555
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,040
Did you meet your boyfriend on Tinder?

556
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,000
- No, but…
- Tell us about it, Amparo.

557
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,920
Well, I'm getting the hang of it.

558
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,520
- I don't need Tinder.
- Have you had a date yet?

559
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,640
- I've had a few dates.
- How did it go?

560
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,840
I didn't go.

561
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,120
- I don't dare, but I'm working on it.
- You must go, you've nothing to lose.

562
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,840
It's a message
from my husband via another…

563
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,480
- another person.
- Really?

564
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,520
He says I must live again.
Before I die, I must live another life.

565
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,960
You need to have sex, Amparo.

566
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:51,440
- You need to have lots of sex.
- Yes, sorry, that's what Tinder is for.

567
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,880
- Yes, I know.
- Well, and to meet people, right?

568
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,360
- Marta, are you on Tinder?
- No, I'm not, I don't need it, my love.

569
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,400
- She has restaurants.
- It's the figure, you know?

570
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,400
After what happened to that girl
from Valencia who was butchered…

571
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,520
- I'll have one last one.
- Who?

572
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,360
That girl from Valencia
who was butchered after dating some guy.

573
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
What was that?

574
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,960
The girl from Valencia, in Carcaixent or...

575
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,640
Does everything happen in Valencia
these days, or what? I mean…

576
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,720
It would be good for Carles to talk.

577
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,360
- Carles, could you say something?
- Marta, you're being a bit nasty.

578
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
- Me?
- You're being a bit nasty.

579
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,960
- I think maybe…
- No, not at all.

580
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,520
- Yes, she suddenly…
- I don't know, I mean…

581
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
We're here chatting...

582
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,400
- No, honestly...
- You needn't have a go at everyone.

583
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,400
- I'm not having a go at everyone.
- You are.

584
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,080
- She's like that sometimes.
- Exactly, you know what I'm like.

585
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,920
That's the way I am, I speak my mind,

586
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,360
- I've no filter. Okay.
- Yeah, we know you, but…

587
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,160
- Is this switched off, Toni?
- Good grief.

588
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,280
Are you going to the bathroom?

589
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,760
- Yes.
- Let her go, it might do her good.

590
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,520
- It will do her good.
- I need a pee.

591
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,960
- Can I go with you?
- No.

592
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,120
- Amparo, are you a lesbian?
- I've a finger in every pie.

593
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,840
- Alex is Marta's friend.
- Alright.

594
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,960
- Everyone's friend, right?
- Of course.

595
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,000
Everyone's friend, of course.

596
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Your gaze pierces my eyes like a sword

597
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,840
It pierces my eyes like a sword

598
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,520
Love is so sweet.

599
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,680
Cheers, to love.

600
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,480
- Here's to love.
- Have you been married long?

601
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,160
- Married?
- Married?

602
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,160
- Aren't you married?
- No.

603
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Sorry.

604
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,160
How old-fashioned, right?

605
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,920
- No, it's all the rage now.
- We're married.

606
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,040
- Right.
- They are, we aren't.

607
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,880
- We're…
- How long have you been together?

608
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,960
A couple of fillings.

609
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,640
A couple of fillings, absolutely.

610
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,440
How did you meet?

611
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,120
At the dentist's surgery?
How did it come about?

612
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,040
At the dentist's surgery,
the goddamn surgery.

613
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,920
The goddamn surgery.
You don't know what happened to me today.

614
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,480
- What happened?
- I mean, well…

615
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,520
I've had a shit day, it started out shit.

616
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,760
A shit day. I woke up,
I saw five calls from Leonor.

617
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,160
- I had to start at eight...
- Leonor is your…

618
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,600
She's my fucking boss.

619
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,200
She's my fucking boss.
I mean, I had loads of missed calls.

620
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:36,640
I woke up and I couldn't find my fucking
knickers, I couldn't find anything.

621
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,600
I got there, I go to the office…

622
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,880
You know, the taxi cost me 20 euros,
fucking 20 euros.

623
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,440
I get to the surgery and I give
some fucking guy root canal treatment.

624
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,840
And the son of a bitch says…

625
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,880
that I've stolen
one of his gold tooth crowns.

626
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,320
- You what?
- I swear.

627
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,320
I stole a fucking gold crown
from his fucking tooth. I mean...

628
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,320
- There and then?
- Why would I want a fucking gold crown?

629
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,520
- Seriously, why would I want one?
- Hey, Lorena, the thing is,

630
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,520
has Leonor said anything to you about it?

631
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,240
Of course she has.
The guy literally ran out,

632
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,800
shouting like a madman, telling Leonor…

633
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,520
He may have been Jewish with a trauma.

634
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,800
- While you were doing his treatment?
- Exactly, because suddenly

635
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,200
he goes kind of groggy.
I'm doing the root canal treatment,

636
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,000
and when I finish, he says he had
a gold crown on one of his teeth

637
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,640
and I'd taken it off.
I didn't see any gold crown.

638
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,040
- Toni.
- I felt like

639
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,520
sticking that ultrasonic scaler
up his ass.

640
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,760
She could've killed him. Just like Greta.

641
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,240
- What do you mean?
- Would you have killed Greta too?

642
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,560
- Greta?
- Greta Thunberg.

643
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,520
A girl called Greta
came to my house today.

644
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,880
No, Greta Thunberg.

645
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,800
It may have been her spirit.

646
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,240
- No, I mean...
- In person?

647
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,120
I don't know, I was thinking about Greta…

648
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,880
- Did she knock on the door?
- No.

649
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,600
What the hell…

650
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,440
You have struggled a lot
and you have climbed mountains

651
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,360
with walking sticks.

652
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,520
I see you have climbed with sticks, but
one day you'll come down without sticks.

653
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,560
Hang on a minute, please.

654
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,880
No, she's right.
Life is different for you, it's easier.

655
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,400
- You're right.
- She's my neighbor.

656
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,800
You're all a bit preppy.

657
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,400
- Preppy?
- You've had it all given to you.

658
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,160
What about you?
How many restaurants have you got?

659
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,040
- Hey, sorry.
- She's worked hard for them.

660
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,240
Yeah, great.

661
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,200
- Hang on a minute.
- What is preppy?

662
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,160
- You've got restaurants?
- I've got five restaurants.

663
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,360
Yes, my family had
two restaurants in Valencia

664
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,400
and when I took over the company,
I opened five restaurants in Madrid.

665
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,240
- Good heavens, a businesswoman!
- When were you poor?

666
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,000
Well, poor… My family had
a restaurant their whole life.

667
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,840
- Restaurants make a lot of money.
- You've never been poor in your life.

668
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,520
- What?
- You've never been fucking poor.

669
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
Even though you worked in a bar.

670
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,400
I've been a hard worker and my family
have been workers all their life.

671
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,520
My family have a restaurant,

672
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,440
and my mother got up at five o'clock
every fucking morning

673
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,080
to go to the market to buy food,
to buy the supplies,

674
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:19,080
to then cook. And I studied a degree
and I took over the family restaurant...

675
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,600
- That doesn't mean you're poor.
- What are you so wound up about?

676
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,920
- Exactly, what are you so wound up about?
- Take out what you've got and share it.

677
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,080
Take out what you've got and share it.

678
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,720
I'll share it out if I feel like it.
What do I have to share?

679
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,880
A bit of wine?

680
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,960
I don't think
it's such a strange question.

681
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,680
Alex, everything's alright.

682
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,960
- No, but she said my…
- Are you a homosexual?

683
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,720
Well, I'll get up and get it.
If you tell me where it is, I'll get it.

684
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,920
Carles, I don't know, but it wouldn't be
a bad idea to look for it.

685
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,680
- No.
- Give me a kiss.

686
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,240
I suddenly imagined
a group of meteorologists

687
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,160
where they all greeted one another
slapping hands.

688
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,520
- It makes me laugh.
- It makes you laugh because I do it.

689
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,880
I'm no kid.
If you did it, it wouldn't make you laugh.

690
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:12,280
Everything about meteorologists
makes me laugh.

691
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,960
Sorry, I got kind of nervous.

692
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,600
The thing is…

693
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,120
Sorry.

694
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,440
Lorena, you're not well, honey.
Lorena, do you want a line?

695
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,400
- I do. I want a line.
- Don't you want a line?

696
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,840
- Sorry.
- What has just happened, please?

697
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,600
- Hang on a minute.
- No, never mind.

698
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,760
- Have you brought your Satisfyer?
- I could do with one.

699
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,080
Maria.

700
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,120
Amparo, you were the one who was shocked
when she said it.

701
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,840
Friends, I have never got stoned.

702
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,520
- Hang on.
- Alright, that's a lie.

703
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,080
I got stoned a long time ago...

704
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,840
- What did you do?
- Lots of things.

705
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,280
- Lots of things?
- But I haven't got stoned in years,

706
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,320
and what I feel like right now…
I want to get stoned, drink a lot...

707
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,040
- No.
- Honestly, I do. I feel like it.

708
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,120
You're crying, laughing,
you're unstable right now.

709
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,920
- Carlos, honestly.
- I feel fucking great.

710
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,760
- I feel like doing a line.
- I don't recommend drugs to friends

711
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,520
- who are suddenly...
- Leave me alone, man.

712
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,160
- For God's sake.
- I'll let you, you're old enough.

713
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,160
Of course she is.

714
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,960
- What would you know?
- That's not what I'm saying.

715
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,640
- Lorena!
- It's not a good time to take drugs.

716
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,040
- Hey!
- Good heavens, what's that?

717
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,320
- An eight ball.
- For feeling good.

718
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,960
- This is XTC.
- What do you mean?

719
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,240
- It's XTC.
- We said cocaine, not XTC.

720
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,000
- See, it isn't a preppy house.
- Maria, not XTC.

721
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,800
There wouldn't be XTC in a preppy house.

722
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
- Come with me, honey.
- Have you never tried XTC?

723
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,960
- Are you alright, Carles?
- Goddamn drugs.

724
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,600
Tonight, I want…

725
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,200
- All we need now…
- I want

726
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,560
- to enjoy it.
- …ls for the cops to come, after you.

727
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,800
I want to enjoy it!

728
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,520
Come on, honey, come with me.

729
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,840
Come on, come with me.

730
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,920
- Hey!
- Water, or what?

731
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,640
Water. Great!

732
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,440
- Come with me, honey.
- Has she had some of this before?

733
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,120
- She's not well.
- Are you alright?

734
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,760
- I'm fabulous.
- You're a bit pissed.

735
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,920
- No, I'm great.
- You'll be great in a minute.

736
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,040
She's my friend
and she's acting a bit strange.

737
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,480
She's your friend?
You must look after her then.

738
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,440
- She's your friend, right?
- Yes. It's precaution.

739
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,480
Asshole, shut it, man.
Looking after your friend.

740
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,320
Carles, cool it, yeah? Cool it.

741
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,600
- A bit of water for Lorena.
- Hell, the guest.

742
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,440
Excuse me, if I don't look after her…

743
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,480
If I don't look after her,
leave her alone.

744
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,880
He's groped all the women in this room.

745
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,679
Maybe you've had a bit too much to drink.
It's no big deal.

746
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,560
- Well, let's drink a toast.
- Sure.

747
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,440
- Let's drink a toast, everything's fine.
- To Carles' bread.

748
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,960
To Lorena. She's a great woman
with a great personality.

749
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,800
- I'll drink to that.
- She's fucking wonderful.

750
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,159
- Please.
- And that's that.

751
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,840
- Listen…
- She earns her money, she works hard.

752
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,680
She can do whatever she wants,
with whoever she wants,

753
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,240
however she wants.
What do you do?

754
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,720
Well, I don't cry and laugh non-stop
in the space of ten minutes.

755
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,680
You earn your money and do your stuff
and pay your taxes so we can all...

756
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,760
I don't understand this paternalism.

757
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,440
You're having a go at her
and I don't know what you do yet.

758
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,600
I'm having a go at her?

759
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,480
- She says you're a musician.
- That's enough, Carles.

760
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,680
I mean, are you self-sufficient?

761
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,400
Yes, I think you're mistaking advice
for concern for a friend.

762
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,840
And in a way you feel attacked

763
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,400
and I don't know why,
you're the new guy here.

764
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,120
- That's enough.
- You're the new guy.

765
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,440
I've known this woman
for much longer than you.

766
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,360
And?

767
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,280
Although I don't screw her,
I take an interest in her.

768
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,360
- I like her and I love her.
- So do I.

769
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Well…

770
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,600
- Sorry.
- Lorena.

771
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,800
Love her the way she is.

772
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,960
- The way she is.
- Okay. Your hand, please.

773
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,760
- I love her the way she is.
- Your hand.

774
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,200
Alright? And if she wants to…

775
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,280
- get stoned or hallucinate, she can.
- Yeah, sure.

776
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,480
What does it matter?

777
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,120
- Let's drink another toast.
- Yes.

778
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,720
- Everything's fine, okay?
- Go on then.

779
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,080
Peace, please.

780
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,120
- I didn't know which side to cover.
- It's alright.

781
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,240
- Go for it!
- You bet!

782
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,360
Go to the bathroom.

783
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,080
- Go to the bathroom.
- Honey, I'm a bit nervous.

784
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,240
What's wrong?

785
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,080
Your guy is a bit…
He's had a bit of a clash with Carlos.

786
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,200
- Really?
- Everything's fine, but…

787
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,120
Toni!

788
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,240
Alex, what's wrong?

789
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,120
- I have to do a story for 1,000 bucks.
- What?

790
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:00,680
Yeah, I need to get stuff,
the brief is basically, "impossible look."

791
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,960
- What do you have to do, get dressed up?
- Yes!

792
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,640
- Now?
- What the hell shall I put on?

793
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,680
- The brief is "impossible look"?
- Impossible look!

794
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,520
Impossible look.

795
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,320
- I get paid 1,000 bucks.
- You what?

796
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,840
- Seriously?
- Wear this, Maria.

797
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:16,360
- Look at this.
- Toni!

798
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,720
- Maria is crazy, like this all day.
- Maria, honey. Wear...

799
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,440
If I don't do it at 11 on the dot,
I don't get paid.

800
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,640
Maria, this one.

801
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,680
- This one, definitely.
- This one.

802
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,040
- Gosh.
- Wait.

803
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,360
Not over the top, dammit.

804
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,960
- Who cares?
- Put it on over the top.

805
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:35,720
- No, Lorena, it's an impossible look.
- Alright, impossible look.

806
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,040
- The other way round.
- Fuck Toni, I'm doing it for you.

807
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,200
- Whose is this?
- Impossible look.

808
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,200
Who the hell sent me this?

809
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,640
- I'm not a size two!
- No, leave it.

810
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,400
- It's an impossible look.
- She's getting worked up.

811
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,160
- Where's Toni?
- The skirt.

812
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,840
- What's up?
- It's 11 p.m.

813
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,640
- I told you to remind me at 11 p.m.
- What for?

814
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,120
For the goddamn stories,
I get paid 1,000 bucks.

815
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,880
Right, we're almost ready.

816
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,880
- Don't tag me in that story.
- Get out of the way, please.

817
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,040
No, don't wear that.

818
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,840
- I need a bit of meditation.
- Let's undo this.

819
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,640
- We'll leave it undone...
- Take a deep breath.

820
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,040
This is impossible.

821
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,120
No, it isn't impossible.
It's possible, trust me.

822
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,120
Do you remember
the last dinner we had together?

823
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,960
I'll go get the eyeshadows.
Amparo, lend me your kimono.

824
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,240
Well, on my way home…

825
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,480
Wait, Maria, honey.

826
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,320
- …I ran over a dog.
- You ran over a dog?

827
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,880
- I ran over a dog.
- You what?

828
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
- I ran over a dog.
- You ran over a dog?

829
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,760
On my way home from here.
When I left here.

830
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,280
I ran over it by accident.
It suddenly appeared…

831
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,160
Don't worry about it.
It's alright. Did it die?

832
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,120
I killed it. Yes, and I left.

833
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,120
- But a dog…
- I can't handle it.

834
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,240
- It was an accident.
- I'd been drinking.

835
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,520
- But a dog…
- A fucking dog!

836
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,520
- A shit dog.
- What about the car?

837
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,000
And you drove off?

838
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,880
Do you prefer video or photo?

839
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,960
- I don't run away.
- Action!

840
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,440
I don't do those things.

841
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,480
Hello, friends from Mexico,
I'm having dinner with my friends…

842
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,360
- Alex, it's just a dog.
- I know.

843
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,240
It's a shit dog. It's a fucking dog, Alex.

844
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,720
…with this brand of vegan make-up.

845
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,320
It hasn't been tested on animals,
which is why I recommend it.

846
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,400
Did you know about the dog, Marta?

847
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,520
Alright…

848
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,320
Is this an impossible look?
This make-up is definitely impossible.

849
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,680
Food products.

850
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,800
Trust it.

851
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,000
- That was awful.
- No, you look fabulous.

852
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,200
You look fabulous, you look great.

853
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,280
You know, in no time people will start

854
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,320
wearing sequin suits
and checkered scarves.

855
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,200
I swear, I sometimes think
I'm playing a role and it's like, what?

856
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,040
Where did this come from?

857
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,560
Maria.
Maria, don't tag me, dammit, I told you.

858
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
You won't be on it.

859
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,000
I don't want to be on it,
today isn't a good day for this, okay?

860
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:09,760
Today isn't a good day
to do this in front of me.

861
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,000
I get paid 1,000 bucks, Toni.

862
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,360
He needs help.

863
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,760
I feel like dancing right now.
Do you remember Woman Against Woman?

864
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,480
What's up, babe?

865
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:31,080
I made that tiramisu because my husband
and I… It's our anniversary today.

866
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,760
It would've been our 30th anniversary.

867
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,720
I'm just saying, if you want to do
a story, don't do it in front of me.

868
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,040
- Stay away and...
- I swear, you're an asshole.

869
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,800
- Why don't we play some music?
- Do you need anything, sweetie?

870
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,680
He's got bipolar disorder.

871
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,440
I don't mean to stick my nose in,
but I can sense these things.

872
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,120
- Carlos, honestly.
- I can sense them.

873
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,240
Hell, that's the way it is.
I mean, I don't know…

874
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,120
We had an argument
and Toni had to intervene.

875
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,120
Don't start to think I'm making this up.
Everyone saw it.

876
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
There was a very awkward silence.

877
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160
Hi.

878
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,040
- Hey, this feels really good.
- Yeah?

879
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,520
Things aren't as important as they seem.

880
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,040
Shall we go to your place?
You can tell me what you've got there.

881
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,760
Go outside
and sort out what you need to sort out.

882
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,720
Is it turned off?

883
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,480
- Not bad. Quite good.
- Thanks for doing something tonight.

884
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
How you doing?

885
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,880
Everything alright, Carlos?
Are you alright?

886
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,680
Thanks, you're so kind.
You're great helpers.

887
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,560
- In the end I stayed, Maria, thank you.
- Great, Amparo.

888
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,360
- If it's what you fancied, that's great.
- To be honest…

889
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,280
I sometimes see you from my house.

890
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,560
Except for when they pull
my shutters down.

891
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,840
But I sometimes see you and I envy you.

892
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,880
- Why?
- Because you love one another.

893
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:05,920
- We love each other? Do you think so?
- I think so, right?

894
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,440
You have a great future ahead,
you make a good couple.

895
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,920
Thanks, Amparo.

896
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,200
I see when the light comes on
and when it goes off at night.

897
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,040
And it reminds me of things.

898
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,320
Not like me. Every time I turn on
the light, they pull the shutters down.

899
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,080
Where's the garbage?

900
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:37,920
The garbage, Maria?

901
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,520
The garbage is over there, Toni.

902
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,680
Like it wasn't your fucking house.

903
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,680
- It often happens.
- Sorry?

904
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,000
- It's normal, it often happens.
- Normal…

905
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:56,000
- What do you mean?
- No, what happened in there…

906
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,440
Hey, let's go inside,
we have to help out, come on.

907
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,240
- Come inside, please.
- We're going to eat Amparo's dessert.

908
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,440
- Just a minute ago.
- Do you know what a déjà vu is?

909
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,440
Absolutely, guys,
I've just had an amazing déjà vu.

910
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,360
I had a déjà vu outside.

911
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,360
- Everything alright?
- Yes, why?

912
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,480
- You both seemed a bit strange earlier.
- Why?

913
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,040
- You both seemed a bit strange earlier.
- Strange? Who?

914
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,760
- You and Toni.
- Nah.

915
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,080
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- I don't know.

916
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,320
Time for tiramisu.

917
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,040
When are the cops coming?

918
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,360
- The cops aren't coming.
- Christ!

919
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,000
- The cops aren't going to come today.
- Why not?

920
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,280
No, there's no need.

921
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:37,800
- Why not?
- So, did you make this, Amparo?

922
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,000
- Yes, I made it.
- Delicious.

923
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,640
- I make it, but I don't eat it.
- Why not?

924
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,120
- I've made it every year for 30 years.
- Why don't you eat it?

925
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,000
Because I don't want to.

926
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,320
You either have a cake or you eat it.
I'd rather have it than eat it.

927
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,520
You can't have both.

928
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,800
- But I want you to eat it.
- Why should we trust you

929
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,080
- if you don't eat it?
- I'm going to eat it right now.

930
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,640
I'm a bit apprehensive
about eating this cake.

931
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,680
- Everything is sorted.
- Okay.

932
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,280
- Sit and eat.
- Let's serve.

933
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,760
I'll cut it. Okay, perfect.

934
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,360
It's salty. It's disgusting.

935
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,760
- Amparo, can you do me a favor?
- Yes.

936
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,960
It tastes awful, honestly, Amparo.

937
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,960
- It tastes like shit. It's salty.
- Marta.

938
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,000
If the tiramisu doesn't taste nice,
it wasn't me.

939
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,040
Yeah, sure, someone went to your house
and made the tiramisu.

940
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,200
Do you want to come to my house?

941
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,640
- Do you want to come to my house?
- Give it a rest, Amparo.

942
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,040
Maybe you're the one
who shouldn't have come here tonight.

943
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,840
Look out of the window.
Have you seen what's out there?

944
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,840
- Go and have a look.
- The house with wood?

945
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,480
- The house with the shutters down.
- And the wood up top?

946
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,480
The shutters are always down.
I can't open them.

947
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,160
I've lots of people at home who don't
want me to open them, just pull them down.

948
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,280
- Sorry.
- Lots of real people?

949
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,720
Lots of people who walk along the ceiling.

950
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,600
- Greta has been to her house.
- Excuse me, I'm leaving.

951
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
- Amparo.
- No.

952
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,880
- Amparo, no, what are you on about?
- No, Amparo, you're fun.

953
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,040
If it's salty…

954
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,440
- It's just salty, that's all.
- You think I'm mad...

955
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
- Amparo.
- It's alright, it doesn't matter.

956
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,920
It's the thought that counts,
you made us the cake.

957
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,840
Sure.

958
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,840
But maybe you should open the shutters,
to let some light in.

959
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,560
- You're spilling all the wine.
- No, I'm pouring you some.

960
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:26,120
No, she's leaving now. Amparo's leaving.

961
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,200
- She isn't leaving.
- She'll go when she wants.

962
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:34,360
- You keep directing people's behavior.
- I've stirred up a bit of trouble.

963
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,560
- You're all the same.
- Stop a minute. Can we cool it?

964
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:39,200
Can we talk about something else?

965
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,600
Why don't you just let people
do what they want?

966
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,560
- Can you stop a minute, please?
- Are you the justice of the peace?

967
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,920
I don't give a damn.

968
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
It doesn't look as though
you don't give a damn.

969
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,720
I don't give a damn,
but you're forever giving orders

970
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,560
on how people should behave.

971
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,320
- No, excuse me, you said before...
- Can we play a game?

972
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,640
- Yes, a game.
- You said to let people do what they want.

973
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,400
Well, she wanted to go home.
I'm just respecting her wishes.

974
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,720
A game!

975
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,200
Amparo. Develop this.

976
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,840
Develop this.

977
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,840
What was that game?

978
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,320
Each person has to…

979
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,440
say…

980
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,640
I don't know, I can't think of it.
What the person on their right is lacking.

981
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,160
What do you think
the person on your right is lacking.

982
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,720
- Seriously?
- I like this game.

983
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,560
- I like it too.
- We all do.

984
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,600
- It's clear to me. What else?
- Yes, Amparo, you start.

985
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,760
- Yes.
- Compassion.

986
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,640
- I'll accept that.
- You lack compassion?

987
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,080
- Yes.
- Where's the wine?

988
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,200
I lack compassion.

989
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,960
Carles.

990
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,560
- Carles about me?
- Yes.

991
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,600
Toni lacks a little bit of…

992
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,360
arrogance.

993
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,440
- I lack arrogance?
- He lacks?

994
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,920
Yes, to accept...

995
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,800
- He lacks honesty.
- To accept, without any problem,

996
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,680
that he's corrupt.

997
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,040
It's no big deal.

998
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,480
- Carles.
- Arrogance isn't a bad thing.

999
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,800
- Pass me the white wine.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

1000
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,720
Maria. Maria lacks…

1001
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,000
- She's your host too.
- Maria lacks…

1002
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,200
- hope.
- Hope? Me?

1003
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,200
- You lack hope.
- Right, hope.

1004
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,000
- It's a game, right?
- It's a game.

1005
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,000
- It's a game.
- Yeah.

1006
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,720
It's a game, but…

1007
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,040
It's a bit intense.

1008
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,800
Marta lacks humility.

1009
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,480
Alright.

1010
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:47,760
- Marta, your turn.
- Maria…

1011
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,720
- Maria lacks…
- Lorena.

1012
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,040
- You have to say what Lorena lacks.
- On your right.

1013
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,040
- You can't take revenge.
- What does Maria lack?

1014
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,040
- She has to say what I lack.
- She wants revenge.

1015
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:04,120
Lorena lacks… balls.

1016
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:13,240
Balls? I lack balls?
I'll never have balls.

1017
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,080
- Because I've got ovaries.
- Okay, alright, ovaries.

1018
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,480
- Ovaries.
- Lorena lacks ovaries.

1019
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:20,640
- Exactly. I agree with that.
- Alex.

1020
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,880
- What does Alex lack?
- Alex lacks…

1021
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,480
Alex lacks affection on all sides.

1022
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,200
- I think the same.
- You're right.

1023
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,720
It isn't your turn.

1024
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,440
- I think the same.
- It isn't your turn though.

1025
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
It's hot in here.

1026
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,040
Carlos lacks a big dick.

1027
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,080
- Maybe.
- I think so.

1028
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,200
- I think so too.
- Carles.

1029
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:44,280
Right?

1030
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,640
Maybe. It's quite possible.
I never say no to anything.

1031
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,000
Right, you need to cry
what you keep hidden away deep down.

1032
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,800
Thank you.

1033
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,320
It's alright, it's what I see,
but I could be wrong.

1034
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,760
Come on, Amparo, let's eat your cake
because you've made it with your pussy.

1035
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,400
Come on,
let's drink a toast to the tiramisu.

1036
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,680
Even though it's awful,
we'll drink a toast.

1037
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,640
- To this tirami...
- It's fucking disgusting this tiramisu.

1038
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:22,040
- It's awful, but it doesn't matter.
- Fucking shit.

1039
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,000
Why do you think I'm not eating it?

1040
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,960
It's fucking shit.
Who made this cake with you?

1041
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,600
A little boy.

1042
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Get away.

1043
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,280
- No, seriously.
- Let's not talk about it.

1044
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,200
No, I want to know who made it.

1045
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,120
I mean, you came here,
you suddenly turned up.

1046
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,960
- We don't know why…
- Got a light?

1047
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,240
- …but you turned up.
- Lorena,

1048
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,120
- because she's our neighbor.
- No, she turned up.

1049
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,960
She came here, she knew you had guests
for dinner and she turned up

1050
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,960
because she damn well wanted to come…

1051
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,160
- No, her electricity went off.
- No, that's what she says.

1052
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,800
We've got fucking electricity,
but she hasn't, fine. She turned up...

1053
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:00,760
I often have power cuts
because strange things happen in my house.

1054
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:05,040
I came, and you're right,
I came because I envied you all,

1055
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,920
because I'm on my own and I feel like
being with people. That's the truth.

1056
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,200
What was that song
by Silvio Rodríguez, remember?

1057
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,960
It goes, "I saw light in the windows."

1058
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,080
- "I saw light in the windows... "
- It's alright.

1059
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,200
- Everything's alright.
- You sure?

1060
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,640
- Shall we patch things up?
- What era are you guys from?

1061
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,680
Forget it, let's kiss and make up.

1062
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,560
Everything's alright, okay.

1063
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,480
I was suddenly dreaming

1064
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:32,440
This is disgusting. Have you tried it?
Have you tried this shit?

1065
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,160
- It doesn't taste that bad.
- Seriously, it doesn't taste bad?

1066
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,920
- Maria, it tastes awful.
- What matters

1067
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,680
is what you feel
when you taste that awful tiramisu.

1068
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,280
- A load of shit.
- It's inedible.

1069
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,560
- It's bitter.
- So do you eat it or not?

1070
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,720
- No, I don't.
- You've learnt something then.

1071
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,040
When something is bitter and tastes awful,
don't eat it, you bastard.

1072
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:53,920
- Sorry, it's just...
- Your neighbor is full of surprises.

1073
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,360
No, sing it.

1074
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,800
- Please don't trouble yourself…
- There's a cute Instagrammer,

1075
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,520
an architect from Andalusia,
I can't remember his name.

1076
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,800
- Instagrammer.
- Instagram.

1077
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,800
- He's getting a bit friendly with Amparo.
- I know.

1078
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,520
That's enough, we all want to sing a bit.

1079
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,400
We could all sing for a while, right?

1080
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,440
- Yeah, sure.
- Right then.

1081
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:24,200
- Do it so we can all sing.
- Lorena, if you want to sing,

1082
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,520
- go into the lounge.
- Let's all sing.

1083
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,200
- This song.
- Let's go to the lounge.

1084
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,480
Carles, I'm sorry.

1085
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:36,320
- Wait, I'll grab my beer.
- You don't know what you're missing.

1086
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,440
I can imagine. A lot, I'm sure.

1087
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,400
Come on, come and sing with us.

1088
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,680
- Let's sing together.
- I'm leaving

1089
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,880
I didn't come to upset you
Let alone offend you

1090
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,480
- I saw light in the windows
- What is it?

1091
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,120
I saw voices singing

1092
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:00,320
And involuntarily I was touching

1093
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,760
THE PARTY

1094
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,640
Lore, what do you want, hon?

1095
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,800
I want a shot,
but I want to drink a toast.

1096
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,680
- Let's drink a toast, please.
- Yes, a toast.

1097
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,840
- Okay, then I'll fetch some glasses.
- We should always raise a glass.

1098
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,920
- To what?
- To life.

1099
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,600
Drink up or you won't fuck.

1100
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,360
So, bottoms up, down the hatch, cheers.

1101
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,040
- I'm not one for drinking shots.
- What do you usually drink?

1102
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,720
- To Greta, they've finally got rid of her.
- Fuck.

1103
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,880
I've got her at my house.

1104
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:04,440
To Greta, to all the girls in the world,
they're worth their weight in gold.

1105
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,880
How does the saying go?
Dead dogs don't bite.

1106
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,400
I know…

1107
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,520
It's a bit… Carles.

1108
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,960
I mean,
I don't wish to renew hostilities,

1109
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,720
but what you just did was in bad taste.

1110
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,680
It doesn't matter, Carlos.
It's just a simple comment.

1111
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:25,160
- No, it's a comment in bad taste.
- It doesn't matter.

1112
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,520
We're happy in front of the fire,
drinking toasts.

1113
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:31,520
We've had a fucking good dinner
that our friends have done for us.

1114
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,440
- I'm not arguing about that.
- Okay?

1115
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,000
Life!

1116
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,720
- Life is full of surprises.
- Carles, it's alright.

1117
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,160
I just don't want you
to make those comments.

1118
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:45,480
They annoy me, that's all.
So I'm asking you not to, please.

1119
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,320
- Lots of things annoy you.
- That's enough.

1120
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,480
Yes, but I say things politely, don't I?

1121
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,480
Maria, can I have some water?

1122
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,880
- Water, right away.
- My mouth is really dry.

1123
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,600
Water, rum, gin,

1124
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,320
- whisky…
- That too. Everything is good tonight.

1125
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:11,760
Honestly, I swear, the son of a bitch,
saying I stole his fucking gold crown!

1126
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,640
- To hell with him.
- The son of a bitch, you know.

1127
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,840
- Maybe I did.
- Toni!

1128
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,160
- Maybe I did steal it.
- You nicked it?

1129
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,000
Amparo,
go fetch some lemons, I've none left.

1130
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,480
On the lemon tree outside.

1131
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,920
Take out the little wisdom I've got,
take it out.

1132
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,240
The little wisdom we've got, take it out.

1133
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:36,600
Carlos, it's 12,000 euros.
That's all it is, it's alright.

1134
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,640
It's nothing serious.

1135
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,840
It isn't really serious.
I mean, it's serious, but not too serious.

1136
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,960
- It's alright.
- Toni, look...

1137
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,320
I needed that cash.

1138
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,240
I needed it.

1139
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,600
- Look, Carles, look how cute.
- No, keep it away.

1140
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,280
- What's the matter?
- Stop it.

1141
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,800
It's so cute.

1142
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,880
It's all public money, everything.
Money is an invention.

1143
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:04,040
Why did you say all that stuff
when we got here?

1144
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,840
- About…
- Well…

1145
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,280
Because I have to defend myself
and defend my image.

1146
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,560
What's the matter?

1147
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,920
What's the matter, darling?

1148
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:14,800
What's up?

1149
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,560
Carles, what's the matter? It's a dog.
It's gorgeous. Birrito is really cute.

1150
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,000
Carles, what's the matter?

1151
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,240
- Yes.
- Pay it back then.

1152
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:36,200
- If it's only 12,000 euros.
- It isn't that easy, mate.

1153
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,920
I wish it was.
It's not just a case of paying it back.

1154
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,080
It's not the money.
I mean, I've been caught out.

1155
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,480
The problem now is defending myself,

1156
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,400
so no one will believe
I took 12,000 euros.

1157
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,920
You stole it.

1158
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,240
- I'm so glad you're here.
- I'll tell you something…

1159
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,800
Your husband is a good man.

1160
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:00,680
I know.

1161
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,600
I'll be right there.

1162
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,440
Darling, please. Seriously.

1163
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:13,400
Maria!

1164
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:16,480
I'll get a gin and tonic for Carlos.

1165
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,160
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

1166
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,760
- You're okay?
- I'm really happy.

1167
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,040
- Happy?
- I had a some XTC.

1168
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,640
- Everything is going well.
- Really well.

1169
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,160
Be quiet!

1170
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,240
Please, don't say no, man.

1171
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,440
Birrito, sweetie, Birrito.

1172
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,760
Maria, Toni, call Birrito.

1173
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,160
Maria, can you take
the dog outside, please?

1174
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:42,800
I think you should take it
for a walk for a while.

1175
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,360
- What?
- What's up with his balls?

1176
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,680
Nothing, it's just… nothing.

1177
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,320
What are they saying, Birrito?

1178
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,120
Guys.

1179
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,320
What's going on?

1180
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,080
Come here, come up onto the podium.

1181
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,840
- You'll see Paris.
- Get up and you'll see Paris.

1182
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,480
- Paris!
- Look, Carles.

1183
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,880
If you like, come to my house tonight.

1184
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,680
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1185
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,520
- Fine by me.
- What for?

1186
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,600
- To help me.
- There are lots of people there.

1187
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,720
There might be a big party.

1188
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:24,160
Carles.

1189
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,920
- Please, don't embarrass me like this.
- Look at this.

1190
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,640
- What?
- Go on, say it.

1191
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,640
- It doesn't matter.
- No,

1192
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,600
but maybe I…
Look, I just let myself go a little bit.

1193
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,160
I improvise…

1194
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,800
- I'm serious, Carlos.
- We've…

1195
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,560
- Are you joking?
- No.

1196
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,280
Are you on Tinder?

1197
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,960
Tinder.

1198
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,680
Well,
aren't you going to put any music on?

1199
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:04,000
Come over here, Carles.
Let's tell him about it.

1200
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:10,080
- He's had a bit of trouble with a dog.
- A dog?

1201
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,320
Yeah.

1202
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,200
When a dog comes near me,
my balls start to get swollen, literally.

1203
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,800
- To hell with dogs.
- It's no joke, his balls get swollen.

1204
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,520
Your balls get swollen?

1205
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,200
- You bet.
- Why have a dog?

1206
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,280
I've tried
all kinds of medication for allergies.

1207
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,080
Where's Birro?

1208
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,320
- Leave Birro.
- Birro!

1209
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,520
- Stop it.
- Birro!

1210
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,200
Leave Birro,
my boyfriend gets itchy balls.

1211
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:39,320
- What?
- Carles gets itchy balls.

1212
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,400
What does he say?

1213
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,480
Have you seen a doctor for advice?

1214
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,720
I've taken all the medication
for all the fucking allergies that exist

1215
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,400
and none of them do anything.

1216
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,480
They said they'll give me
a psychological test

1217
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,080
to see if it's a psychological problem.

1218
00:58:55,240 --> 00:59:01,360
I can't understand how the hell
you screw an 80-year-old meteorologist.

1219
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,120
Some parents

1220
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:08,800
don't even give it to their children.
What do you like, Amparo?

1221
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:12,240
Play a song on the guitar.
Play something.

1222
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,320
Play something.

1223
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,640
Carlos, please.

1224
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,040
Gosh, Maria, this has got me really high.

1225
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,440
- I swear.
- It's the XTC.

1226
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,640
I've no idea. I don't know what it is.

1227
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,520
Bravo!

1228
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:54,800
I've never tried other things.

1229
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,320
And I don't know if I'm willing or not
to let something happen,

1230
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,400
but if one day it were to happen,
if I were to have something with someone,

1231
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:07,920
it could well be with you. Possibly.

1232
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,160
If it happens now?

1233
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,320
It can't happen now. Not now.

1234
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,120
It can't happen now.

1235
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:23,080
It can't happen now.
It won't happen now.

1236
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,080
Not now, it can't happen now.

1237
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:26,400
With people, yes.

1238
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:29,080
I have a kind of…

1239
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,360
No, I said leave Lorena alone.

1240
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:35,200
Somewhere else.
Most of all somewhere else.

1241
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:40,440
Christ.

1242
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:43,400
I shouldn't have got stoned today.

1243
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,720
- Why not?
- I shouldn't.

1244
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,360
Are you crying again?

1245
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:50,000
- What do you mean, you like Carlos?
- I like Carlos?

1246
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,480
- Kind of…
- I really like him.

1247
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,040
Like, really?

1248
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,480
He's cute.

1249
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:01,880
- I'd screw him.
- You and all the girls.

1250
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:04,480
- Goddamn Carlos.
- I'm with a fucking man

1251
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,680
with itchy balls.

1252
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,160
- It's terrible.
- Get that shit out of your head, Lorena.

1253
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,200
What are you worried about?

1254
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,800
- Carles...
- You can play the ukulele.

1255
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:16,880
Play the ukulele.

1256
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,800
Yeah.

1257
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:20,320
- Did you take XTC?
- Just a bit.

1258
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:26,280
Hey, we need some rum, gin,

1259
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,920
- gin and tonics...
- What's this?

1260
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,400
Pass me that gin and tonic
and I'll be on my way.

1261
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,600
No, that's water.

1262
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,880
- The ukulele.
- If that's what you can do, do it.

1263
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:36,960
Alright.

1264
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,400
- Carlos.
- What's wrong?

1265
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,560
Nothing.

1266
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,960
I'm sorry.

1267
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,960
There's nothing wrong, honey.
There's nothing wrong.

1268
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,640
- Have you got a light?
- Yes.

1269
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,920
Listen…

1270
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,920
I mean,

1271
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,120
is it this guy? To rule things out.
Is it because of this guy?

1272
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,760
No. I don't know.

1273
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:31,040
- Lorena, who is this guy?
- I don't know.

1274
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:33,000
- He's got itchy balls.
- A client?

1275
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,600
- It's the dog.
- He talks to me this close.

1276
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,160
He touches me. He touches everyone.

1277
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,960
- You're in it too, Amparo.
- I'm not needed.

1278
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,880
Your girlfriend was crying.

1279
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,200
Your girlfriend was crying.

1280
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,200
Amparo, take a look at this lad,
he looks pretty bad.

1281
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:52,280
- What's wrong?
- What's up?

1282
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,840
- Are you alright, honey?
- Thanks for the lad.

1283
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,840
You're all… Have you taken drugs?

1284
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,240
That's enough. My wife's over there.
My wife.

1285
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,920
My wife is over there, Alex.

1286
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,840
Are you alright? Do you want to puke?
Are you alright, Carles?

1287
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:13,200
Hey, the meteorologist is on a low.

1288
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,280
The son of a bitch
that accused me of stealing a crown...

1289
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,520
- Lore, honey, Carles isn't well.
- Are his balls itchy?

1290
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:22,280
His balls are itchy
'cause he's allergic to the dog.

1291
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,880
- Tell him to fuck off.
- What's he allergic to?

1292
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,120
He's fainting, hon,
something's wrong with him.

1293
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,520
- Carlos, help me, please.
- He brought the bread

1294
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:32,040
and the wine in a plastic bag.

1295
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,840
Shall we call an ambulance?

1296
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,120
- I don't know, he doesn't feel well.
- Are your balls itchy, Carles?

1297
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,080
- You've got itchy balls.
- Wait a minute,

1298
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,760
- stand up.
- Poor thing.

1299
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:44,560
The guy has got itchy balls.

1300
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,720
No, he's in a bad way,
wait a minute, please.

1301
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:49,640
Hold on!

1302
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,520
- Hey!
- Please!

1303
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,480
Take it easy.

1304
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,360
Please, this man is...

1305
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,440
- Calm down, okay.
- Okay, take it easy.

1306
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:01,360
- Open the door.
- Yes, open the door, get some fresh air.

1307
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,360
- Please.
- Alejandro!

1308
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,880
Maria,
get the dog out of here this minute!

1309
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:09,320
- Get the dog out of the house, now.
- Birro.

1310
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,480
Hello, Carles.

1311
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:12,680
Scratch his balls.

1312
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,760
Alex! Shut the fuck up!

1313
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,520
- Are you off your head?
- Where are you?

1314
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:20,240
- Carles, honey.
- Carles!

1315
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,520
- Carles!
- Don't hassle him.

1316
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,840
- He's an asshole.
- Lorena, has this happened before?

1317
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,800
I don't know, it's the first time.

1318
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,880
All I know is that the dog was causing
some kind of a reaction.

1319
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,600
- Has he fainted because of the dog?
- I don't know.

1320
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,080
I don't know him that well.
I've only been seeing him two months.

1321
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:43,240
This guy is a fucking shit guy,
he's been touching our butts all night.

1322
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,000
I'm telling you.
Seriously, he's fainted, he can't hear me.

1323
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,880
This is no time for this.

1324
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,440
Now you know,
he's been touching our butts.

1325
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,760
He's been touching our goddamn butts.

1326
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:56,320
This is no time for this nonsense,
goddammit.

1327
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,040
- Marta, not now.
- Carlos...

1328
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:00,720
- Not now.
- Don't push me aside like that.

1329
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:05,160
- What an asshole.
- Marta, I'm sorry, okay? Look at him.

1330
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,600
His eyes are closing.
Call the emergency services.

1331
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:10,760
Shall I call? Okay, I'll call.

1332
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,480
Carles, come on. Wake up!

1333
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,120
Son of a bitch. Come on!

1334
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:18,320
Wake up, you son of a bitch.

1335
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,040
- Did he touch your ass?
- Everything.

1336
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,080
- Carles.
- Get a cloth.

1337
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:25,000
- Carles, darling.
- Okay, he's coming round.

1338
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,840
Carles, darling,
don't you remember anything?

1339
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,320
- You're in a bit of a...
- Alex!

1340
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,720
Alex, that's enough!

1341
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,480
Christ!

1342
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:36,080
Carles, you're at a friends' dinner party.
Friends who…

1343
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:40,480
- are with you and everything's fine.
- But they're not really your friends.

1344
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,560
- You kind of came…
- Wrongfully.

1345
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,880
- Lift him up.
- Let's see how you are.

1346
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,440
Carlos, how come you can't cope?
You love this.

1347
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,680
Talk to me and tell me
you don't need an ambulance.

1348
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:56,400
They're two of a kind.
Looking at them both now…

1349
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,680
- Carles.
- Let's sit him up.

1350
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,200
- You need to rest, right?
- Let's sit him up.

1351
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:06,280
- He can't.
- Come on, Carles.

1352
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:08,160
Be careful.

1353
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:11,400
- There we go.
- It's alright.

1354
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,240
Right.

1355
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,360
- That's enough, Carlos.
- Carles, honey.

1356
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,480
- What's his name?
- Carles.

1357
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:20,120
- What else?
- The guitar!

1358
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,440
It was a gift from me
and it cost a fortune, dammit!

1359
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:23,800
Just a second. That's it.

1360
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,080
- You'll come with me to my house, okay?
- Do you want a line, Carles?

1361
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,840
Do you want to come with Greta,
to my house?

1362
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,120
With Greta?

1363
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,320
People die

1364
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,560
- because they don't have all this.
- Of course.

1365
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,160
- Youth, love, affection...
- This is being alive, right?

1366
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,040
This experiment was filmed live
amongst friends

1367
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,160
and with no budget on 7 December 2019.

1368
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,040
The cast had a short description
of their character.

1369
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,479
All the acting was improvised.
Without a script.

1370
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:37,960
Three months later, a global pandemic
forced all Spanish citizens

1371
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:40,439
to remain confined to their homes
under a state of alarm.

1372
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,600
- It was all a lie.
- A lie?

1373
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,880
It was a lie. This is water.

1374
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,479
The son of a bitch gave me a fright.
I thought he was really dying.

1375
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,880
Look at Amparo.

1376
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:34,200
You're all fucking great!

1377
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,600
You're fucking great!
