00:00:00,678 --> 00:00:04,240
The Year 1971 Africa
Democratic Republic of Guinea

2
00:00:04,678 --> 00:00:09,687
In the aftermath of November 22, 1970, the President,
Ahmed Sekou Toure, said the Guinean people have

3
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:14,770
finally triumphed over imperialism, courageously
repelling the Portuguese mercenaries paid by

4
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:19,883
opponents of the regime... An important
wave of arrests will follow throughout 1971.

5
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:46,702
My dear friend, do you still remember Guinea?

6
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:52,296
Jacques, I often think of you, your sister,

7
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:57,875
your parents, older brother Diallo.
May Allah bless you all.

8
00:00:59,056 --> 00:01:05,265
Nothing that belongs to this forest,
will ever be foreign to you.

9
00:01:05,539 --> 00:01:10,016
Since our separation I pray
every day to find you,

10
00:01:10,174 --> 00:01:13,924
in order to understand what happened here.

11
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,470
<i>"Somewhere Towards Conakry"</i>

12
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:26,202
I was twelve. I had left the Koran school...

13
00:02:26,265 --> 00:02:29,170
...for the high school at Dézié.

14
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:32,688
I was going to meet you at last.

15
00:02:33,077 --> 00:02:34,877
- Hey!
- Who is it? Fuck.

16
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,300
Hey!

17
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,849
Perhaps a spy for the Chicken gang.

18
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:42,506
Shit, he'll look through the
look and he'll tell everything.

19
00:02:43,032 --> 00:02:45,222
Lift it up. We'll talk with him.

20
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:49,702
- Yeah, let's tie him up. We'll tie my
pretty bomba around his neck. - Oh no!

21
00:02:49,762 --> 00:02:53,534
He shouldn't see the hut.
There is no.... It's too dangerous.

22
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:56,303
- I know that guy.
- Hey!

23
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,934
- Well then, what did I say?
- Okay, I go down to talk with him.

24
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:01,845
Watch out, eh?

25
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:20,963
- Are you the leader?
- Who are you? What are you doing on our turf?

26
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:25,737
But I came to congratulate you with the hut.
You know I live here in Green Boal.

27
00:03:25,762 --> 00:03:27,024
And by the way, I saw it.

28
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:30,834
You saw what? You never saw the hut,
else you better watch it, you hear?

29
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:36,388
Hey, Madiou! Let your mother
grind cassava! Go guard your herd!

30
00:03:36,407 --> 00:03:39,205
<i>(Local dialect)</i>

31
00:03:39,725 --> 00:03:44,034
Is that understood? If we find you
on our turf, I'll box your ears!

32
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,629
Madiou, what did he say?

33
00:03:50,654 --> 00:03:56,659
I warned him that tomorrow I'm going to
Kimbou in the same class. He's too smug.

34
00:04:18,306 --> 00:04:19,877
Down with imperialism.

35
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:21,306
The traitor. At the stake!

36
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,798
Down with the fifth column!

37
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,291
Long live President Ahmed Sekou Toure!

38
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:26,877
Down with imperialism.

39
00:04:26,893 --> 00:04:28,353
The traitor. At the stake!

40
00:04:59,722 --> 00:05:02,754
I present you the new boy: Madiou Léhouma.

41
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,840
Sit down children.

42
00:05:05,516 --> 00:05:07,972
Now we'll find you a seat. Over there.

43
00:05:09,563 --> 00:05:11,400
This is your desk.

44
00:05:21,214 --> 00:05:24,595
"He's a Chicken spy."

45
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:39,331
- Hey, that's yours?
- What do you think?

46
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:41,203
But did you make it yourself?

47
00:05:41,228 --> 00:05:44,954
Of course! I have others,
but this one is the best.

48
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,380
For how much you sell it to me?

49
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:49,987
If you give me 10 comics, it's yours.

50
00:05:50,012 --> 00:05:53,837
How much you said , ten?
Five is already a lot, you know.

51
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,437
- No, ten.
- Anyway, I don't have ten.

52
00:05:59,078 --> 00:06:01,477
If you want, I teach you how to make them.

53
00:06:10,944 --> 00:06:13,293
"A lease" becomes "leases".

54
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:19,603
- "A coral" becomes "coral".
- Yes, go to your place!

55
00:06:19,627 --> 00:06:22,320
Jacques Séverac. Get up!

56
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,442
Can you recite other special cases?

57
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:33,505
Have you learned your lesson, Jacques?

58
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:37,282
"Window".

59
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:40,132
- "Window" becomes "Windows".
- Yes.

60
00:06:40,663 --> 00:06:42,501
"Stained Glass".

61
00:06:42,615 --> 00:06:45,091
- "Stained Glass" becomes "Stained Glasses".
- Continue!

62
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:48,325
You see, when you want to, you
can learn your lessons. Go on!

63
00:06:48,388 --> 00:06:51,881
- And "Work" becomes "Works".
- Good.

64
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,754
One more to go.

65
00:06:56,025 --> 00:06:57,728
Madiou.

66
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:05,280
- "Leaf" which becomes "Leaves".
- All right.

67
00:07:05,984 --> 00:07:08,763
Take your arithmetic exercise
book, we'll make an exercise.

68
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,310
Well done grumpy.

69
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:23,840
Hey, I agree about the car, I'd like to learn.

70
00:07:23,873 --> 00:07:27,501
I've no time, I have to learn my lessons.

71
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:54,057
- Mayaté!
- Visiting your aunt, Madiou?

72
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:19,126
You're curious, Madiou.But only
you will know my secrets one day.

73
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,892
But Mayaté, I sorted out the oil.

74
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:30,516
Come here my child.

75
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:37,193
You should thank your uncle for letting
you go to the factory school.

76
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:44,759
- Are you pleased, Madiou?
- Oh yes, Mayaté.

77
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:59,536
- Hello, uncle.
- Well Madiou.

78
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,425
- How are you? Learning good things over there?
- Yes.

79
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:07,588
Hey Madiou, since you're going to the white school,
you never visit me. I always find you here.

80
00:09:07,837 --> 00:09:09,872
Huh, what did I do to you, Madiou?

Magalie, it's done. Where are you going?

86
00:09:54,913 --> 00:09:58,183
Magalie, you shouldn't hang out in the bush.

87
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:33,337
Come on, guys!

88
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:06,524
- Look!
- The old men have entrusted me this field.

89
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,956
The thugs will set it on
fire and it's your fault!

90

We must make them leave! We must make them leave!

- I know: we'll go see Yamou.
- Let's go!

The Guinean Democratic Party told imperialism:

99
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:03,113
Your dreams, you'll swallow them.
It is me who shall bury you.

100
00:13:03,295 --> 00:13:06,967
Therefore to denounce the enemies of the people,

101
00:13:07,324 --> 00:13:10,057
the attitude of corrupt party officials,

102
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:16,251
and lackeys of imperialism, is effectively
fighting against imperialism.

103

- Long live the revolution!
- LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!

104

- Didn't you hear what I just said?

This day is a holiday for the
revolution. No one has to work.

Ah well. But it's always holidays with you guys.

110

- But who'll cultivate my field and feed my family?
- The party has decided, comrade.

The party feeds its people.

112

- The party isn't the father of my children. Nor you.
- You know who I am?

113
00:14:00,323 --> 00:14:05,022
I'm the representative of the
government. The party here is me!

The party of your mother, yes! Who are you?

Me and all the old men here, we saw you being born.

there. And now you want to decide for us?

enough for the colonists, eh?

- Mayaté.

I'm afraid that you don't see me enough.

One day you'll leave school for another.

00:22:05,809 --> 00:22:09,911
Now we all take off our clothes, wash hands,

169
00:22:09,987 --> 00:22:14,467
feet, head, and visit one by
one the spirit of the hut,

170
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,351
to ask him for protection.

171
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,825
- Naked?
- Yes, naked like this.

172
00:22:18,975 --> 00:22:23,101
- All the same, eh.
- Go guys. Like he said, do it. Get naked!

173
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:26,800
- Hey guys, I can go down, there's nobody.
- No, you keep watch.

174
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:35,116
Hey Ismael, are you afraid we'll see
that you got no hair on your butt?

175
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:40,914
You know, Jacques, it's not right,
it's forbidden to practice witchcraft.

176
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,583
So are you afraid? You rather
leave the hut to Chicken?

177
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:46,982
But if there is a sorcerer, he could be
sent by Chicken to destroy the hut.

178
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:48,363
Yes, but it's true.

179
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:52,384
This is counter revolutionary, the president
himself said so. I won't go along.

180
00:22:52,602 --> 00:22:56,060
What are you talking, you're not even from Guinea.

181
00:22:56,141 --> 00:22:58,006
I'm not from Guinea?

182
00:22:58,061 --> 00:23:01,776
I'm not from Guinea? And my grandfather
is not from Guinea either?

183
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:04,164
<i>(Local dialect)</i>

184
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:07,109
Come back! If you leave
the hut, you're finished.

185
00:23:07,223 --> 00:23:11,419
- You're a traitor!
- Yes he's right, they're conspiring with Chicken.

186
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:12,625
Yeah!

187
00:24:01,133 --> 00:24:03,883
Hey, you lead me?

188
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:23,168
- That's it, you made your wish?
- Yes, that's it, I did.

189
00:24:23,307 --> 00:24:26,327
Above all, don't open your eyes.

190
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,798
Now you can open your eyes. You know
I heard everything you told the spirit?

191
00:24:46,017 --> 00:24:49,442
- Why? I have not spoken aloud.
- It's like that in my family.

192
00:24:49,674 --> 00:24:52,843
So you really think I risk nothing more?

193
00:24:58,736 --> 00:25:02,056
- The spirits will protect you.
- Even when I grow up?

194
00:25:02,174 --> 00:25:07,783
Now they'll follow you until death.
And when you have a serious problem,

195
00:25:08,057 --> 00:25:12,549
you must come see the spirit
here in the sacred cabin.

196
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:18,100
Only you can come. You alone know the secret.

197
00:25:20,797 --> 00:25:24,748
Tell me Madiou, why is there
food in front of the altar?

198
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:29,197
The spirits eat. They are very greedy.

199
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:34,161
When you bring cookies, they'll eat them.

200
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:46,208
So, how much you paid for your badges?

201
00:25:46,413 --> 00:25:51,242
I gave him an American cigarette.
They also gave me a little red book.

202
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:54,553
- It is tiny.
- Don't they have bigger hands?

203
00:26:02,987 --> 00:26:05,521
Hey guys, I still can't see them.

204
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:09,276
- Hey! There's Magalie.
- Hey Magalie!

205
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,836
- Do you know where your brother is?
- Can I come up?

206
00:26:11,876 --> 00:26:13,455
No! We said no women here.

207
00:26:13,535 --> 00:26:17,047
- But that's not the same.
- He's right: no women here. Let her speak from below!

208
00:26:17,066 --> 00:26:19,944
I agree with Lom. Let her come
up as long as she doesn't talk.

209
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:23,351
- Bunch of savages. It's Jacques' sister.
- Savage yourself!

210
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:27,794
Ah, this is your hut, it's really big.

211
00:26:27,843 --> 00:26:30,675
- Well, you saw it. Now tell us where Jacques is.
- Give her a minute!

212
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,651
You mean she's taking us for a ride.
She doesn't even know where he is.

213
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:37,011
- He said...
- You tell us or I'll toss you in space.

214
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:41,543
- Can't you see you scare her, big dummy!
- So Magalie, what did your brother say?

215
00:26:41,614 --> 00:26:44,735
Hey guys, they're coming! I see Chicken!

216
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:10,546
Look, the leaf men!

217
00:27:10,578 --> 00:27:12,974
- They live like that?
- They are farmers.

218
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:17,035
They'll dance in the woods and
around the village, to bring rain.

219
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:20,517
But nobody should see them.
Especially not the children.

220
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:24,730
- If they catch you, you knock there.
- Madiou (local dialect)

221
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:54,228
- Jacques, you have to go home.
- You not coming home with me tonight?

222
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:59,652
- I thought you lived with your uncle.
- I have to leave for a few days.

223
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:02,069
Where to?

224
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,002
It's like a journey. I have to be circumcised.

225
00:28:06,081 --> 00:28:09,208
- They'll cut your bangala?
- Yes.

226
00:28:09,633 --> 00:28:15,423
- Why? What did you do? Is this to punish you?
- No, for me it's a great honor.

227
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:23,875
I'll be a great muslim. I'll be able to
pray, alone, and make all men pray.

228
00:28:36,335 --> 00:28:39,929
- See you tomorrow?
- No, not tomorrow.

229
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,487
Hey, Cat? Where are you going?

230
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:00,451

... all of a sudden the wind picked
up, the trees got uprooted,

233
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:14,038
Bushes flew away and Chicken's gang dashed off like rabbits.

234
00:29:14,138 --> 00:29:16,856
They were scared stiff.

235
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:21,316
I myself don't believe it,
but then he's fierce, right?

236
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:25,822
Jacques, you know me, I fear nothing, but then...

237
00:29:25,822 --> 00:29:29,126
Go, go, go home!

238
00:29:43,889 --> 00:29:48,411
What you got on your shirt?
Serge, answer me! Serge!

239
00:29:50,234 --> 00:29:53,227
Take that shirt off!

240
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:59,755
Take off that shirt! Never, do you hear me,
should you wear such things.

241
00:29:59,976 --> 00:30:03,383

Who gave that to you? Who
gave it to you, tell me! Who?

245
00:30:16,432 --> 00:30:22,090
It was a very nice man. He gave them
to us... What have I done wrong?

246
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:27,209
They start as in Romania, with
badges, slogans, communist filth.

247

- Why you refuse to understand? Why? Look at me!
- I've done nothing wrong.

Mom.

250

- Mayaté.
- If you are brave, men will know who you are.

251
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,760
So you should pass the first test.

252
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:04,661
- Are the others afraid as well, Mayaté?
- Yes.

253
00:31:06,053 --> 00:31:11,490
Nothing can happen to you that you can't handle.

254
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:25,213
Since September 28, 1958,

255
00:33:25,994 --> 00:33:32,086
as one man, the Guinean will
understand Africa's voice,

256
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:38,843
thus proving to the whole world,
no people can... our people,

257
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,184
that all the people are capable,

258
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:47,148
that all people can exercise
their sovereign right to life.

259
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,643
Go, grab that one, grab it!
Catch it! Come on, catch it!

260

Go ahead, grab the others! Go!

261
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:17,670
Come on, catch that one!

262
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:25,107
You, go home now! Thief! Get the fuck out of here!

263
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:28,435
Fuck off!

264
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:34,947
I recognized you. I know where you live. Thieves!

265
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:43,096
Jacques! Come here!

266
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:46,901
- I won't repeat it, Jacques come here!
- No, Daddy, no!

267
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:58,083
Anyway you're never here, so it's easy to judge.

268
00:34:58,571 --> 00:35:01,166
You want to jump in the sandpit, I won't
stop you, especially when it's 40 degrees.

269
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:03,660
Maybe if you talked to him more
often, he would do less bullshit.

270
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:05,737
Of course, that's easy, of course.

271
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:08,920
You expect me to be everywhere,
he does this, he does that.

272
00:35:08,945 --> 00:35:12,484
Don't you think that if you got more
involved, he would do a bit better?

273
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:16,347
So after barter, it's theft and politics.
With all the crap we're dealing with now.

274
00:35:16,372 --> 00:35:20,352
But I won't tie my son to a chair! If he won't
listen to me, what do you want me to do?

275
00:35:20,423 --> 00:35:26,148
Look, it's decided. Any way, it's boarding school.
If there's something I can't stand, it's lying.

276
00:35:41,568 --> 00:35:46,462
We have to conform to what is said in the meetings.
Aren't you a soldier of the people as well?

277
00:35:48,155 --> 00:35:53,530
Stealing a chicken from a prominent
party representative. How dare you?

278
00:35:54,623 --> 00:35:58,469
You know what they do to thieves?
They cut off their evil arm.

279
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:03,591
- But uncle, it's to make a sacrifice.
- Fetishism is forbidden! You know that very well.

280
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:07,585
How do you dare, after your initiation?

281
00:36:09,808 --> 00:36:14,345
If only I knew this before, I would
never have let the old men initiate you.

282
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:19,900
You know what the party said, right? Soon
you won't go to the school of the whites.

283
00:36:20,115 --> 00:36:24,329
Besides, you don't need to go
to school to be respected.

284
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:28,666
You're a good pioneer and
you'll be a better militiaman.

285
00:36:29,205 --> 00:36:32,669
And finally, you won't play
with this white boy no more.

286
00:36:32,709 --> 00:36:34,192
The white boy is my friend.

287
00:36:34,217 --> 00:36:38,501
The white boy is not your friend! You
dishonor your people. Shame on you!

00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:44,070
Will you stop harassing this child?

<i>(He's reading the Koran)</i>

291

My uncle has spoken bad because
he's upset about the guard.

292
00:37:14,134 --> 00:37:19,811
- I should never have done that after my initiation.
- You know Madiou, we could run and hide.

293
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:26,005
Otherwise they'll lock me in a boarding school.
I don't want to live with them.

294
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:37,623
Jacques, you have to think. If we don't
know where we're going, we may get lost.

295
00:37:37,781 --> 00:37:40,115
We must go back to where we came from.

296
00:37:40,185 --> 00:37:43,932
Then Magalie will join us. I promised her.

In regard to the party I took a big risk.

reports all I do to the party.

friend to the sacred cabin. Why didn't you tell me?

night everything is lit in green, yellow, blue, red.

Yes, but we're also rich. We
have a lot of mineral resources.

Yes of course, but it's different.

Oh, thank you, that's nice.

355
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,957
I have to ask for a holiday, sir.

356
00:47:17,132 --> 00:47:19,663
Tell me, Diallo, what's your
problem? Why are you afraid?

357
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:24,322
The scheme with the Portuguese.
They're looking for the Guinean traitors.

358
00:47:25,582 --> 00:47:29,878
And I am Fulani, ma'am.
They say I am a conspirator.

359
00:47:30,344 --> 00:47:33,360
- That I miss too many Friday meetings.
- Who is it, Diallo, tell us.

360
00:47:33,419 --> 00:47:38,798
Oh, the people of the local revolutionary committee.
Those blokes of BPN came to investigate.

361
00:47:39,002 --> 00:47:44,428
They say I am a former French military
in the service of imperialism.

362
00:47:46,118 --> 00:47:50,807
- So tomorrow they want to interrogate me.
- You did nothing, you don't have to worry.

363
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:56,325
- Baccari was arrested, Madame.
- They arrested Baccari? - Yes.

364
00:47:56,685 --> 00:47:58,573
- Then you must leave at dawn.
- With Jacob.

365
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,708
- You know where to go?
- Yes I know.

366
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:02,093
- You think your brother can replace you?

367
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:05,570
Abel? Yes, he'll be there tomorrow.

368
00:48:06,238 --> 00:48:08,537
- You keep us informed. Okay?
- Okay.

372
00:48:19,491 --> 00:48:23,177
- Diallo, when will you come back?
- Soon.

373
00:48:30,081 --> 00:48:31,804
Comrades!

374
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:36,433
Given the perilous situation in the country,

375
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:39,757
the Politburo dispatched last month,

376
00:48:39,862 --> 00:48:42,925
in each administrative region, a delegation...

377
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:47,206
...to make direct contact with the comrades activists...

378
00:48:47,297 --> 00:48:49,920
...to conduct investigations.

379
00:48:50,244 --> 00:48:54,203
Comrade Keita will give a report
of these investigations.

380
00:48:56,742 --> 00:49:02,438
Comrades, know that a man who once...

381
00:49:02,502 --> 00:49:06,575
was a friend of the people,
he can later become the enemy.

382
00:49:07,094 --> 00:49:12,172
The counter-revolutionary loves
the people like the goat likes grass.

383
00:49:13,098 --> 00:49:17,720
So we found, thanks to the patriotism of a militant,

384
00:49:18,466 --> 00:49:22,480
3 accomplices concealed inside the revolution.

385
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:26,456
Individuals suspected and summoned,

386
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:29,490
to be accountable to the people of Guinea are:

387
00:49:29,577 --> 00:49:32,907
Boubakar Bari, baker,

388
00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:36,850
Lamin Kaba, trader,

389
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:41,256
And Amadou Diallo, servant chef.

390
00:49:41,503 --> 00:49:44,211
Ready for the revolution.

391
00:49:45,783 --> 00:49:50,227
Militants Comrades! The people
of Guinea threw a net.

392
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:53,204
No reactionary will escape.

393
00:49:53,264 --> 00:49:56,242
In the meantime, I have great news for you:

394
00:49:56,687 --> 00:50:01,065
The federal office will set up in each federation,

395
00:50:01,272 --> 00:50:04,539
a local regional school. So,

396
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:08,523
The bravest young boys, in initiation trials,

397
00:50:08,637 --> 00:50:11,581
will be taken automatically to the regional school,

398
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,140
in order to complete their ideological training.

399
00:50:15,383 --> 00:50:19,490
- Long live the revolution!
- LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION!

400
00:50:19,529 --> 00:50:23,562

Dad, why are you taking us by car this morning?

402
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:29,223
There are many people in town because of
manifestations. I don't want you to be late.

403
00:50:46,505 --> 00:50:48,965
- Hey, where are you going?
- I told you to close the window.

404

- Will you shut up, Jacques!

405
00:50:57,696 --> 00:50:59,793
Go! Hurry up!

406
00:51:04,217 --> 00:51:06,637
Come! They're all over the place. Come quickly!

407
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:11,729

Madiou! I have to congratulate you
for your courage, for your self control.

413
00:53:09,859 --> 00:53:13,784
You've shown yourself worthy of the
revolution by marching past the traitors.

414
00:53:14,067 --> 00:53:19,523
We must support the revolution at all costs.
And you are an example for others.

415
00:53:20,612 --> 00:53:25,570
Of course your father, my dear brother,
wanted you to frequent the factory school.

416
00:53:25,806 --> 00:53:29,346
After all these years of study, he
thought you could become in your turn,

417
00:53:29,437 --> 00:53:34,527
a brilliant Guinean intellectual.
But you see where all this has led, eh?

418
00:53:35,647 --> 00:53:39,783
The poor man didn't yet know
that imperialism was not dead.

419
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,715
If he was alive today, he would tell you:

420
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:48,344
"You must continue your ideological training among
the pioneers and you have to leave the Quimbo school"

421
00:53:52,156 --> 00:53:56,208
Sorry uncle, but I really
want to go to the factory school.

422
00:53:56,435 --> 00:53:59,666
- I want to learn.
- What?!

423
00:53:59,854 --> 00:54:03,985
Madiou, if I understand correctly, you
want to disobey your father? Is that it?

424
00:54:06,905 --> 00:54:10,965
Oh my uncle, you must forgive me.

425
00:54:12,828 --> 00:54:15,944
Go, I forgive you.

426
00:54:18,594 --> 00:54:22,826
- My father knows all about those who were hanged.
- I'll beat Madiou up myself.

427
00:54:23,066 --> 00:54:25,532
It was him who marched past Diallo.

428
00:54:25,753 --> 00:54:28,559
If they did that to my servant,
I swear I'd kill him.

429
00:54:28,584 --> 00:54:31,485
I won't contain myself and they'll
have to hold me, otherwise...

430
00:54:31,712 --> 00:54:35,119
- You should learn how to contain yourself, my boy.
- Eh, sir!

00:54:35,211 --> 00:54:38,612
- Excuse me.
- Come on, everyone go to class!

You know, Mr. Séverac, the Guinean
revolution is not an illusion.

477
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:43,076
It's the essence of our people.

478

Until Nov. 22, imperialism believed
it would kill the Guinean Revolution...

inactive in the funding of 22 November.

481

Thanks to their servants still present on
Guinean soil, they thought to eliminate us.

But no! We killed imperialism and
showed, in face of the world,

483

that the Guinean Revolution triumphed in the end.

484

You are listed as a reserve in

485
01:00:17,672 --> 01:00:21,232
So you have 15 days to leave the country and go home.

01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:57,045
Is this what you wanted to show me?

491
01:01:02,036 --> 01:01:05,612
Now you understand why we're here?

492
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:11,288
You see, if you'd ask me, "What is Africa?"

493
01:01:12,693 --> 01:01:15,325
I would show you that.

494
01:01:16,313 --> 01:01:19,520
And it's so immense, you
could never put it on a photo.

495
01:01:21,189 --> 01:01:25,391
Then there is all the noise,
the colors, the smells.

496
01:01:27,698 --> 01:01:29,881
You give me the camera?

497
01:01:35,416 --> 01:01:38,726
- No, Daddy, no!
- Come on Jacques! Give me a smile, Jacques!

498
01:01:40,187 --> 01:01:43,713
- Jacquo!
- No!

499
01:01:51,139 --> 01:01:56,674
Dad, I don't want to go to boarding
school. I want to stay here.

500
01:01:58,253 --> 01:02:00,508
You know, we'll surely return to France.

501
01:02:00,556 --> 01:02:03,882
No, Dad, that's not true! You're lying Dad!

502
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:09,583
- My home is here. We can't leave! I'll never leave!
- Jacques.

503
01:02:09,624 --> 01:02:12,794
- No!
- Jacques, son! - No!

504
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,649
- No!
- Stop it!

505
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:20,193
You can't behave like a child
anymore. You'll be 12 soon.

506
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:24,208
You know there are serious things going
on here, that it's difficult at the moment?

507
01:02:24,459 --> 01:02:26,801
So it's better to go back to France.

508
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:29,818
And your buddies, the Goberts,
the Pétrojacs, they're going too.

509
01:02:29,866 --> 01:02:31,112
And Madiou!

510
01:02:58,006 --> 01:03:01,170
- Will you at least eat well?
- Yes.

511
01:03:01,954 --> 01:03:04,656
You can't blame him who feeds you.

512
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:08,890
Your uncle has made many sacrifices
for you since his brother's death.

513
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:16,868
But men are like the birds. They can't stay
on the branch, they need the whole sky.

514
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:20,548
But Mayaté...

515
01:03:20,674 --> 01:03:23,971
Leave! Go meet your friend!

516
01:03:24,311 --> 01:03:28,465
If your friend is good, he will forgive you.

517
01:03:43,394 --> 01:03:46,202
Dad, can I go now?

518
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:51,233
Go son! Try to be here at six o'clock!

519
01:04:08,726 --> 01:04:12,653
- Hi grumpy.
- So what have you got to say now?

520
01:04:13,959 --> 01:04:16,991
Jacques, we'll always be friends.

521
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:20,945
You must forgive me for Diallo. I didn't know.

522
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:25,451
I was forced to march past.
We could do nothing for Diallo.

523
01:04:25,659 --> 01:04:30,418
It was the decision of the party. And
then my uncle forbade me to see you.

524
01:04:30,695 --> 01:04:35,651
Sorry Jacques. I was obliged to talk
bad about him in front of my cousins .

525
01:04:38,488 --> 01:04:40,786
So you do everything your uncle says?

526
01:04:41,373 --> 01:04:43,695
If he tells you to jump in a well?

527
01:04:44,231 --> 01:04:48,731
But no. My uncle is good to me.
He wouldn't think of hurting me.

528
01:04:48,914 --> 01:04:53,283
- Diallo was good as well. He did nothing wrong.
- Hey Jacques, where're you going? Wait for me!

529
01:04:53,382 --> 01:04:58,023
- I go to "Concouré".
- It's forbidden! The militia keeps watch over there.

530
01:04:58,082 --> 01:05:01,206
Are you afraid of them? I'm going.

531
01:05:01,308 --> 01:05:05,031
But you know, Jacques, the
militiamen are bad right now.

532
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:30,267
Dad!

533
01:06:38,343 --> 01:06:42,391
Madiou, there's the militia. Madiou, wake up!

534
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:54,760
Awake, Madiou. The militia is there.

535
01:08:22,504 --> 01:08:25,663
Give me back Madiou. I beg you.

536
01:08:25,876 --> 01:08:28,325
I should have remembered he can't swim.

537
01:08:28,757 --> 01:08:33,170
I know you can. If only you return him to me.

538
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:37,734
Please. bring him back.

539
01:09:14,688 --> 01:09:16,702
Jacques!

540
01:09:19,847 --> 01:09:21,911
Jacques!

541
01:09:24,978 --> 01:09:26,425
I'm here.

542
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:32,374
It's been an hour since we
called you. You'll get a hiding.

543
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:34,951
I don't want him to touch me.

544
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:38,581
He won't do anything to you. Come Jacques.

545
01:09:39,271 --> 01:09:44,731
- I'll go hide. I'll never get back.
- You're not leaving?

546
01:10:07,395 --> 01:10:10,297
Come on Magalie, come to the table! There's pie.

547
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,415
Hurry up!

548
01:10:32,753 --> 01:10:35,043
Madiou?

549
01:10:36,046 --> 01:10:38,567
Madiou?

550
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,168
Madiou! My friend.

551
01:11:04,249 --> 01:11:07,396
I waited for you.

552
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,523
You know I wanted to play on the sacred river.

553
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:15,752
And there I met a great white spirit.
This spirit is a good one, brave.

554
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:20,516
I saw him fight against evil spirits. And he won.

555
01:11:23,125 --> 01:11:27,824
Is it true what you thought just now?
You will really come someday?

556
01:11:28,246 --> 01:11:32,263
When I grow up I'll come back
for you. We'll both stay.

557
01:11:40,315 --> 01:11:45,453
Come on, gather! Militiamen, service men,
it's the hour of the meeting. Be quick!

558
01:11:46,021 --> 01:11:47,546
Quick!

559
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:09,590
What are you looking at? Give me that!

560
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:21,063
Magalie be nice, bring it back to Mrs. Korsky!

561
01:12:21,142 --> 01:12:23,602
Tell her I'll come see her tomorrow, eh?

562
01:12:30,053 --> 01:12:33,945
Next time we'll persuade you, Ms. Korsky.

563
01:12:40,842 --> 01:12:42,542
Give me that!

565
01:13:05,292 --> 01:13:09,021
The young must remain vigilant,

566
01:13:09,232 --> 01:13:12,653
strengthen their ideological
and political education.

567
01:13:12,713 --> 01:13:16,095
They must observe the behavior
of activists, executives,

568
01:13:16,197 --> 01:13:22,774
because the conspirators are not only
among the corrupt unconscious elements.

569
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:25,661
Do not hesitate.

570
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:31,506
The hesitation of a youth would amount to
the reduction of the revolutionary potential.

571
01:13:33,138 --> 01:13:36,828
You must fight everywhere, denounce if necessary,

572
01:13:36,888 --> 01:13:39,922
such local committee, such federal office.

573
01:13:40,123 --> 01:13:43,297
The future is you!

574
01:13:43,554 --> 01:13:46,466
Never forget!

575
01:14:30,536 --> 01:14:33,101
Jacques!

576
01:14:43,139 --> 01:14:44,901
Jacques!
