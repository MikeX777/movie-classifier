1
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,088
Your wife,

2
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,083
your daughter,

3
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,610
your son.

4
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,608
Behind you, your parents.
The emotional circle's closed.

5
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,481
What are you feeling now?

6
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,125
I feel vile. Guilty.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,241
I want to get out of here.

8
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,569
Ms Jarczyk?

9
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,930
I'm happy, when he's unhappy.

10
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,689
Kaim?

11
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,887
My sisters beside me.
Why did she want tn die?

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,244
You committed suicide.

13
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,204
Why?

14
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,400
I wanted to unburden my father.

15
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,890
What do you want to do now?

16
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,889
I'd like to hug him.

17
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,771
Go ahead!

18
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,121
No,

19
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,364
it's impossible,
I don't want to hear this.

20
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,921
Back ever there, please.

21
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,930
Your wife?

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,042
I don't love him.

23
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,886
I want him out of here.

24
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,845
But I haven't... there's nothing...

25
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,484
And your son?

26
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,888
My heart hurts.

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,565
I'd like mother tn stop hating father.

28
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,568
It's your fault
my daughter died.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,890
And now my son's sick.

30
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,845
Leave me alone! All of you!

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,044
It's not my fault!

32
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,483
I don't even feel hatred.

33
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,729
Just contempt...

34
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,887
We'll finish up
tomorrow morning.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,531
It's too bad we broke oh?

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,725
Please go to your rooms.

37
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,328
Don't talk to each other,
please.

38
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,568
And no television.

39
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,845
We'll meet for breakfast
at 8.00 tomorrow.

40
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,846
He's still not here.
And it's already 8.15.

41
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll go see what's up with him.

42
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,525
Mr Telak left us yesterday.

43
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,367
Please, don't take it personally.

44
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,404
What now? Is that it?

45
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,809
Patients tend to react forcefully
after such intensive therapy.

46
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,930
What about us?

47
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,726
No, come on, that's lust wrong!

48
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,242
But I can't force anyone!

49
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,526
The therapy's voluntary,

50
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,369
I barely persuaded him
to do it anyway.

51
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,486
Isn't it weird? The whole
family starts with an a.

52
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,121
Agata, Agnieszka and Antoni.

53
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,567
You'd rather we all began
with a b?

54
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,808
Bronislaw for me
and brigitte for you.

55
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,607
- Bonaventura for me...
- That's a man's name.

56
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,201
Nope, it ends in an a,
ergo, a woman's!

57
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,767
I wouldn't want to start
with a b.

58
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,122
Not to mention grandpa Andrzej.

59
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,166
I saw one bacteria
that was lust so like you...

60
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,327
Give me a break!

61
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,763
Mummy, he's suffocating!
He'll die!

62
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,041
Oh, Jesus!

63
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,603
30 degrees in the shade...

64
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,728
And they didn't even
crack open a window for him.

65
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,727
- We need to call the police.
- There's no time for that!

66
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,249
Agnieszka! Stand back!

67
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,005
Careful...

68
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,204
- All right... here, boy, here!
- I've got some water.

69
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,724
Gut it?

70
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,922
There you are.

71
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,329
What's going on here?

72
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,722
Some imbecile shut
their dog in a car in this heat.

73
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,365
And you've gone one better!

74
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,562
- What was I supposed to do?
- The dog was suffocating!

75
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,570
You've destroyed the car.
Your id, please.

76
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,807
Here you are. Excuse me.

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,401
- Hello? Yes, what?
- They were all tight shut and...

78
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,847
Ok, fine, I'll be there asap.
If I must"...

79
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,202
I'll be happy tn cover the cost,

80
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,721
but as you can see, I'm a prosecutor
and that very same day,

81
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,730
I'll have the owner in court for
ill-treating an animal. Ok?

82
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,810
- Where are you going asap?
- I have to go to work...

83
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,126
But it's Sunday!

84
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,721
- I do know it's not Tuesday!
- I was meant to go into the lab...

85
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,968
So, work at home!
I'll be back soon.

86
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,566
- Who's in charge here?
- Lieutenant Smolar.

87
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,208
That's not Slawek Smolar,
by any chance?

88
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,363
I don't know! Smolar.

89
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,641
Thank you, you can go.

90
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,722
"Only mountains never meet..."

91
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,082
You became a prosecutor?

92
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,244
Well, we had to meet
sooner or later.

93
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,762
Later would have been
fine by me.

94
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,767
Sure...

95
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,601
Fingerprints?

96
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,723
None on the instrument itself.

97
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,409
And what's that in his eye?

98
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,806
A skewer.

99
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,488
There was a set in the dining room.

100
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,930
He died around midnight.

101
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,124
There was nobody in this wing.
It's closed oh' from the hotel.

102
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,210
Theoretically, it'd be possible
to break in, but why bother?

103
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,602
So we have four suspects.

104
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,447
A psychologist and
the people in therapy.

105
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,808
On the face of it,
there's no motive.

106
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,490
On the face of it?

107
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,209
Yeah. I mean someone had to
drive that skewer into his eye.

108
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,085
You don't do something like that
without a reason.

109
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,360
The widow's arrived, lieutenant.

110
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,767
Please accept my condolences.

111
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,325
How did it happen?

112
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,128
In all probability,
assault and robbery.

113
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,766
An accidental death.
He must have run into the burglar.

114
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,009
He received a fatal blow to
the head from a sharp instrument.

115
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,804
He died at once.
The doctor says...

116
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,002
He wouldn't even have felt
any pain.

117
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,923
May I see him?

118
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,801
That might not be the best idea...

119
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,764
I want tn say my farewells.

120
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,606
Evidence is still being collected.

121
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,770
Besides,
it's not a pleasant sight.

122
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,604
As you wish.

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,968
- May I go now?
- Of course.

124
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,004
But we'll have to talk.
Would you come and see me, please?

125
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,202
How about tomorrow?
Around noon?

126
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,965
And the body?

127
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,170
There'll have to be an autopsy.

128
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,569
But the funeral home will be able
to collect him on Thursday.

129
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,485
Here's the number
to a support center...

130
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,409
For the families of crime victims.

131
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,007
It might help.

132
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,248
- Will they bring back my husband?
- Knwnacki, drive Mrs. Telak...

133
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,649
No, thank you.
I've got the spare keys.

134
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,328
Odd... as if she really
hasn't taken it in.

135
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,966
My wife wouldn't take it in either.

136
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,128
She was laughing even
at the divorce hearing.

137
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,368
So why did you marry her?

138
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,208
For her sense of humor.

139
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,564
And you... did you get married?

140
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,568
- Hi! Got anything for me?
- Nothing for the jackals.

141
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,250
No politicians
and no celebrities involved.

142
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,568
You're not nice.
And in front of the ladies, too.

143
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,888
- Prosecutor zieleniecka...
- Szacka.

144
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,048
- Are you new in town, ma'am?
- I am.

145
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,570
Tip me oh' when you get anything.

146
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,409
Szacka?

147
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,409
Get on with interviewing
the witnesses, ok?

148
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,887
- Want to arrest someone?
- Right now, I don't have cause, do I?

149
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,448
Put them through the wringer.
Find the killer, I'll lock him up.

150
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,411
They can't like you much
at the prosecutor's office.

151
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,921
Not if they land you with
a case like this.

152
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,007
Is this going to take long,
lieutenant?

153
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,965
It's rather inconvenient.
We've already been here 3 hours.

154
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,960
I understand your irritation.
If it's any consolation,

155
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,243
you're still in a better situation
than the deceased.

156
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,166
Bad joke.

157
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,402
It's not a joke,
it's the truth, doctor.

158
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,001
I have to question you.
And then we'll decide what next.

159
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,363
What next? You're not going
to arrest us, are you?

160
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,040
Now that, I'm afraid,
I can't promise.

161
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,563
You're not going to believe
who I met today.

162
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,165
Who?

163
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,284
It doesn't mailer_.

164
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,451
Who?

165
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,006
I love this. First of all
you want to tell me something,

166
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,524
then you decide you don't want
to talk about it.

167
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,360
It'd be better
if you didn't start at all.

168
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,369
Who did you meet?

169
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,211
I think I'll put Agnieszka
down for ice-skating.

170
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,727
She's got such inborn grace...

171
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,603
Agata, are you finally going
to tell me who you met today?

172
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,566
You don't tell me everything,
ehher.

173
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,444
And you're surprised?

174
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,651
You're a prosecutor, after all...

175
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,045
Watch.

176
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,725
Belt.

177
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,528
How about my shoelaces, too?

178
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,846
Shoes.

179
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,446
And what've I got there?
A kalashnikov?

180
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,768
I don't know. We'll see.

181
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,689
- Can't you hurry it up?
- I'm sure we can.

182
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,964
Yes? Hello?

183
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,401
Ifs Igor.

184
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,251
- Go on.
- I have some bad news, sir.

185
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,363
- Hen/yk's dead.
- What happened to him?

186
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,131
I'm afraid it was
an unfortunate accident.

187
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,809
Come to the airport.

188
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,010
- We're going back.
- What?

189
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,565
Grab all that, honey, grab it.

190
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,770
- Just what are you doing, sir?
- Can't you see? I'm through.

191
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,968
If this is how you treat
passengers,

192
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,162
nubudy'll bother tn fly at all!

193
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,207
The weather's breaking,
mr chairman.

194
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,243
I just don't get it.
Why've we come back...

195
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,841
Take it easy, babe.
Go with the driver.

196
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,768
Maybe it's a good thing
you turned us back.

197
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,042
A week with her and
I'd probably have gone crazy.

198
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,241
Tell me what happened.

199
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,169
Henryk was murdered...

200
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,806
Nn Saturday night.
At przegurzaly castle.

201
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,761
- What the fuck was he doing there?
- Group therapy.

202
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,440
One of the others in the
group could have killed him,

203
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,961
or someone who knew he was
going to be there.

204
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,242
Or a burglar,
like the police are claiming.

205
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,601
Bullshit, not burglars.

206
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,565
They always say when they want
to get the press oh their backs.

207
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,442
What should we do?

208
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,608
The initial procedure's already
been set in motion.

209
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,121
- That'll do for now.
- Are you sure, sir?

210
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,051
The person who killed him
won't get far.

211
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,890
Who's running the investigation?

212
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,006
Smolar at police hq and Szacka
at the d_a_ 's oh'ice_.

213
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,209
Smolar___.

214
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,962
- And who's this Szacka?
- New. No experience.

215
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,647
That shouldn't be a problem then.

216
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,806
Well?

217
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,241
Nothing.

218
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,842
Nothing?

219
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:14,331
- Nothing's also something.
- What am I supposed to make of that?

220
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,405
Nobody saw anything,
nobody knows anything,

221
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,965
nobody has any suspicions.

222
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,044
The whole group had been
in therapy for a week.

223
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,765
Before that,
they didn't know each other.

224
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,162
They say that Telak
was deeply depressed...

225
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,570
And they're so convincing I almost
believe he committed suicide.

226
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,690
And your impression?

227
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,368
Nice. Nice.

228
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,968
Nobody was unnaturally
composed. Or agitated.

229
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,726
None of them gave anything
away about themselves.

230
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,605
Henryk Telak was the first
of the group to be the subject...

231
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,609
Of the family
constellation method.

232
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,171
And what's that?

233
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,165
Look it up on the Internet.
Hellinger's method is lust a way...

234
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,328
Of bullshihing people out
of their money.

235
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,960
Interview everyone
who was around.

236
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,730
Someone might have
seen something.

237
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,968
The windows and the door
are barred.

238
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,481
The Porter could have dozed oh?

239
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,801
I really can't lock
all four of them up.

240
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,850
Prohibit them from leaving
the fold.

241
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,122
- Pardon?
- Take their passports.

242
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,601
These days, one travels
on one's id, you know?

243
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,804
In your opinion, what kind of man
was henryk Telak?

244
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,331
Well,

245
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,771
very unhappy.

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,004
Anyone who goes into psychotherapy
is kinda' nuts,

247
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,407
but he'd had exceptionally
bad luck.

248
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,604
You know,
his daughter committed suicide.

249
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,167
And six months after her funeral,

250
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,569
he found out about his son's illness.
A congenital defect.

251
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,043
You found the body, right?

252
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,402
It was before nine.

253
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,081
I ran oh' the terrace
into the dining room...

254
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,363
I found the body there,

255
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,251
with that skewer in its eye.

256
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,887
That's it. I started screaming.

257
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,248
Who arrived first?

258
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,888
Ms jarczyk_ then dr rudzki...

259
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,520
And finally, Kaim.

260
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,206
The doctor yelled that nobody
should touch anything...

261
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,811
Until police arrives...

262
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,810
And to get out because we were
trampling on the evidence.

263
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,082
Which one of your group
could have murdered Telak?

264
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,169
I don't know. I have no idea.

265
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,806
I see.

266
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,570
But if you had to take a guess,
name one person, ___

267
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,161
- then who would it be?
- Kaim, perhaps.

268
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,086
He played the role
of lvlrtelak's son in the session.

269
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,727
You could see that his father
had wronged him badly. So...

270
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,522
I thought perhaps it was he...
Out of revenge on his father...

271
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,371
That he'd had no love,
well, and generally...

272
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,331
Yes, I felt hatred toward him.

273
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,969
And did you kill him?

274
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,368
- No.
- And did you want to?

275
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,762
No. Honest to God, no.

276
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,487
And what do you think?
Who killed him?

277
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,243
How would I know that?
The papers said it was a burglar.

278
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,568
An adult guy's supposed to kill...

279
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,246
Some other guy...

280
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,928
Because during a session...

281
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,363
He pretended
to be his unloved son, right?

282
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,170
I don't know.

283
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,567
I did say that I don't know.

284
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,684
I was taking part in a constellation
for the first time...

285
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,764
And it's an experience
close to losing consciousness.

286
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,729
The longerl stood there,

287
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,969
the worse I felt and the less
like myself.

288
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,284
Ok, so now you're looking at me
as if I've lost the plot,

289
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,561
but I'll finish anyway.

290
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,164
I wasn't pretending
to be his son.

291
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,169
I was clearly becoming him.

292
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,362
And please don't ask me
how that's possible.

293
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,286
Which one of your group
murdered Telak?

294
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,049
Nobody, of course.

295
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,525
You surely can't be thinking
that one of us is a murderer?

296
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,007
You'll vouch for people
you've only lust met?

297
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,844
Well, no...

298
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,521
But, I mean, they're normal people,

299
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,564
I've heard their life stories.
It must've been some thug.

300
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,491
Since they're normal, how come
they're having psychotherapy?

301
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,603
No, that's not fair.

302
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,565
All of us have problems
of some kind,

303
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,366
but not everyone can cope
with them on their own.

304
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,368
- Hania?
- Why?

305
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,001
The daughter commihed
suicide at the age of filleen___

306
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,564
I'll bet my life he molested her
when she was a kid.

307
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,606
Hania sensed that and
she could have killed him.

308
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,366
Like, in some kind of sleepwalking
state, for example.

309
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:05,161
No, it's not right to
throw accusations around.

310
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,929
It also came out
during the therapy that...

311
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,611
Lvlrtelak's wife hated him...

312
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,725
And ivis Jarczyk played that hatred
so evocativelym

313
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,930
I don't know myself.

314
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,170
And what did you feel
when you saw mr Telak's body?

315
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,801
First of all I was terrified.
And when I calmed down,

316
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,445
I felt a sense of relief.

317
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,611
I've never met anyone
as wretched as him.

318
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,168
So I thought that perhaps somebody
had done him a kindness.

319
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,610
There couldn't be any world
where he'd be worse oh'___

320
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,564
than he was here...

321
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,647
Lvly apologies.
But in my current state...

322
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,571
I couldn't make it tn your office.

323
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,768
At least
I didn't miss the view.

324
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,007
Impressive, isn't it? You should come
and visit me once it's dark.

325
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,084
Let's begin, otherwise I really
will be here till nighh'all_.

326
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,649
Seme coffee er tea?

327
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,491
A glass of water will be fine,
thank you.

328
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,207
When did you meet mr Telak?

329
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,962
I was organizing an international
psychotherapists' conference.

330
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,568
Looking for a printer for the
publication of the papers,

331
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,843
I came across his company,
polgrafex_.

332
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,844
He was intrigued by the contents
of the publication.

333
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,084
I told him that
I try to help people...

334
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,368
For whom life's lost its meaning.

335
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,968
That was when he told me
about his daughter's suicide,

336
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,010
his troubled relationship
with his wife ____

337
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,565
I asked if perhaps he'd like
to meet with me.

338
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,685
He wasn't sure, but a week later,
he phoned.

339
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,887
We met once a week.

340
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,528
Then I decided to use
systemic family constellations.

341
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,331
And they are___?

342
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:39,408
Bert hellinger's family
constellation method.

343
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,288
Other patients embody the subjects
family members.

344
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,366
We build a model
of the emotional relationships...

345
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,967
To discover hidden dependencies.

346
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,806
But why do you limit it
lust to the family?

347
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,721
Aren't emotional relationships
between people who aren't related...

348
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,410
Often the most powerful?

349
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,728
We're concerned
with the archetypal love...

350
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,604
Which is not
of our own choosing.

351
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,128
Love for our children,
our parents and our grandparents...

352
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,609
Is thrust upon us
by the law of nature.

353
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,121
If you'd like to read up on it...

354
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,407
During therapy, did Telak
tell you that he had enemies?

355
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,169
Telak was a broken man, withdrawn,
closed in on himself.

356
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,004
I don't think anyone in his circle
paid him any attention.

357
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,367
Please set up
your immediate family.

358
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,967
Barbara will be your wife.

359
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,446
Yes.

360
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,407
Kaim will be your son.

361
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,208
And hania, your daughter.

362
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,166
But I...
My daughters dead.

363
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,010
Put her in place, please.

364
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,966
We 'll place
your dead parents here.

365
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,926
Your primary family.

366
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,251
So, this is how it looks,
henryk.

367
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,130
You can see your family.
What are you feeling?

368
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,803
I feel vile.

369
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,004
- Gui/ly.
- Breathe, please, breathe deeph/.

370
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,123
Sit down.

371
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,164
But what kind of theater's this?

372
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,370
Do they receive a script
beforehand?

373
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:35,363
No, and whats more, they know
almost nothing about henryk.

374
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,841
They don't know that he ran away
from home as a teenager,

375
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,401
orthat his parents died tragically.

376
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,488
Did you see
what's happening there?

377
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,923
Try and draw some conclusions
from the way he placed them.

378
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,964
Telak is lonely.
His wife isn't standing beside him,

379
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,764
his children aren't looking at him.

380
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,083
Think about what the children say.

381
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,729
They want to be together.

382
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,924
And they want to go to their grandparents.
What does that mean?

383
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,409
They want to die. But why?

384
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,166
Out of love for their father.

385
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,768
He failed to give due reverence
to his parents before their death.

386
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,282
He disturbed the systemic balance.

387
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,770
That means that someone must
take atonement upon themselves...

388
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,284
And it's most often a child,
who enters as new into the system.

389
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,890
The child takes on the burden
of restoring the equilibrium,

390
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,846
takes on the guilt, anxiety and anger.

391
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,127
Watch what happens, please.

392
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,607
The son.

393
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,122
My heart hurts.
I'd like things to be better for Dad.

394
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,368
For mother to stop hating him.

395
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,131
It's your fault my daughter died.

396
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,011
And now my son's sick.

397
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,929
Leave me alone!
All of you!

398
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,362
It's not my fault!

399
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,806
I don't__.

400
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,409
Come on, how's it possible
for Kaim's heart to be huding?

401
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,563
I mean, how can he feel
physical pain?

402
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,643
The morphogenic field theory...

403
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,804
Is used to explain hellinger's
therapy.

404
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,209
According to the theory, what
we are doesn't only depend on genes,

405
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,846
but also on an electromagnetic field.

406
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,205
Hellinger maintains that our spirit
resonates with everything...

407
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,801
That happens within the given
family and is connected...

408
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,368
Not only with the living,
but also with the dead.

409
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,968
While the constellation
is being put in place,

410
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,401
a stranger can enter
that resonance.

411
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,965
And you believe this?

412
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,850
Belief is meaningless,
as far as I'm concerned.

413
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,963
What's important is whether
it's eh'ective or not.

414
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,965
I myself have witnessed how family
secrets of which the patient...

415
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,561
Had no idea at all have emerged
during the constellation.

416
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,727
Interesting.

417
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,127
It could provide a new
investigation method.

418
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,560
Establishing the guilty...

419
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,569
Party on the basis
of family constellations.

420
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,240
- A sense of humor, too...
- I'm not joking.

421
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,609
If you'd tell me more about
the other patients' case history,

422
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,690
it could prove immensely helpful
to the investigation.

423
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,571
I can't reveal my patients
secrets...

424
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,761
Very well then. Please give me
all your recordings.

425
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,691
There's bound to be a clue
in there somewhere.

426
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,571
I rather fear that they,
too, are a professional secret.

427
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,364
May I remind you of the law?

428
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,961
And may I remind you that a murder
has been committed and that I,

429
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,764
as a prosecutor,
am investigating the case?

430
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,362
- I thought it was a police matter.
- You thought wrong.

431
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,043
Now, sir, you're one of the
chief suspects.

432
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,651
I could write out
an arrest warrant...

433
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,205
Right here and now
and call the police.

434
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,765
And then write
out search warrant...

435
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,610
And take all the recordings
for myself.

436
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,280
Would you prefer
to deal with it that way?

437
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,609
[ - You're ]Oking_
- by no means. So?

438
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,409
As you please.

439
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,964
Thank you very much.

440
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,445
Is this your first
criminal investigation?

441
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,841
It is.

442
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,923
- And what did you work on in tarnow?
- Economic frauds.

443
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,201
They have economic frauds
in tarnow?

444
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,688
No. Which is why they
closed down the department.

445
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,843
Sit down, please.

446
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,408
The investigation will be
tedious and laborious.

447
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,365
That's probably why I was
assigned to it.

448
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:25,769
Don't be too hasty
to pronounce judgment.

449
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,971
It's a fundamental sin
for a prosecutor.

450
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,204
I read it your file that your
maiden name's zieleniecka.

451
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,286
- Is Professor zielenieeki any relation?
- My father.

452
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,290
Daddy.

453
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,162
Thanks to him we have
our modern criminal law.

454
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,165
The police made a note...

455
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,522
That Telak's wallet
was found among his things.

456
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,087
Take a look at that wallet.

457
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,370
A wallet can speak volumes
about its owner.

458
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,324
His wallet. Of course.

459
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,131
Hello? Yup, he's here.

460
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,242
Oh, it's you. Hi.

461
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,368
Things? Sure. Personal.

462
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,366
Toothbrush, razor,
that kind of stuff. Pajamas.

463
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,289
Sure, there was a wallet.

464
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,287
Nothing interesting.

465
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,691
Look, I'm telling you,
nothing interesting.

466
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,968
Ok, I'll send it over.

467
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,288
New lady friend, huh?

468
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,208
The prosecutor, idiot.
Supervising the investigation.

469
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,442
Prosecutor? Which one?

470
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,361
- Not that sperm whale gaiewska?
- She's new. You don't know her.

471
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,204
New? Pretty?

472
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,562
Depends en your taste.

473
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,846
A new prosecutor and you're going
"oh, it's you"?

474
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,811
Keep your fucking nose out of it.
Curiosity killed the cat.

475
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,002
Whadd'ya want?
We're investigators, right?

476
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,407
She's a friend.
We studied law together.

477
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,051
Jablonski?

478
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,006
Sling Telak's wallet in an envelope...

479
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,401
And take it over
tn the d_a_ 's office.

480
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,525
- Prosecutor... Szacka, it seems...
- Tell him to call me.

481
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,007
And wolniak wants to talk to you,
so call him.

482
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,009
He's fallen in love, I reckon!

483
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,801
Look. Where's the city police?

484
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,482
They'll be copulating here in
broad daylight before long.

485
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,848
Do they have
any interests at all?

486
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,880
Dope, fucking and computer games.

487
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,608
How's this country supposed
to develop?

488
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,968
Who's going to pay our pensions?

489
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,686
You're not intending to live
on a pension, mr chairman?

490
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,248
Me, nu.

491
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,326
Unfortunately, I have to work.

492
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,211
But all those people
in Poland who fucking

493
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,562
sweated for decades
for a few cents,

494
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:04,842
they're going to be kept
by that lot?

495
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,048
What a generation.

496
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,961
They did a survey recently
in primary schools.

497
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,202
Fihy-five percent of them
didn't know...

498
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,448
What the warsaw uprising was.
Can you imagine that?

499
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,847
No. But young people have
always been like that.

500
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,644
They don't read books.

501
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,646
They watch the school reading
list on DVD. On fast forward.

502
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,568
In 2009,67% of poles hadn't read
so much as one book a year.

503
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,091
When I was in high school,

504
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,362
you fucking discussed books
during breaks.

505
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,006
Kafka, salinger, gombrowicz
and James Joyce.

506
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,965
“Ulysses“_a sensation
when they published it here.

507
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,680
Sold like hot cakes.

508
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,286
And is this the price we have
to pay for democracy?

509
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,801
The complete dumbing down
of the nation.

510
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,764
Well? Does it look as if the
henryk matter will be all right?

511
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,724
It looks like it'll be all right.

512
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,049
The prosecutor's drawing up
the investigation schedule...

513
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,765
And then we'll know more.

514
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,651
- When will we get it?
- This evening.

515
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,368
Yes?

516
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,207
Listen, I've remembered...

517
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,971
Hat he had some lottery tickets
in his wallet.

518
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,401
Could you check and see,
in case he won something?

519
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,806
The widow would find it handy.

520
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,364
Couldn't this have waited
till the morning, lieutenant?

521
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,166
I have no means of checking
at this precise moment.

522
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,850
Good night.

523
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,001
Come and loin us. Dorota says
she's not angry with you.

524
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,168
So what's her problem and
how come it's with me?

525
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,405
Seems you left her in a club.
Alone. In the middle nf the night.

526
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,761
What the fuck? Alone in a club,

527
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,968
when there were at least
a hundred of her friends there?

528
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,725
Come and tell her yourself.

529
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,803
I'm going home.
I'm not in the mood.

530
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,450
I'm sorry I phoned during
the night,

531
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,449
but I'd had a couple of drinks and...

532
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,968
No problem.
I can't talk now. Yes?

533
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,561
- The police just sent this over.
- Thank you.

534
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,607
Seven, eight, nine, seventeen,

535
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,087
twelve, twenty-two.

536
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,930
I checked. He didn't win anything
with the numbers he picked.

537
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,449
You're asking me what's going on?

538
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,881
You had the idea
that if he'd won the lottery,

539
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,367
his wife would gain by his death.

540
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,722
I just told you,
he didn't win a thing.

541
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,082
Was it you,
who told us to check whether...

542
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,362
The deceased stabbed himseli
in the eye?

543
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,444
Yes. We have to be certain.

544
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,967
No bruising, cuts, stab wounds,
signs of struggle...

545
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,004
Or bullet wounds
ascertained on the limbs ortorso.

546
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,645
The left eye is missing,

547
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,047
multiple fractures
tn the left orbital bone.

548
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,767
Perhaps you'd like us to chop
oh' his member,

549
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,327
put it in formaline and leave it
on your desk for you, ma'am?

550
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,171
I imagine you're aware
that the law contains a clause...

551
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,044
Regarding the profanation
of remains.

552
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,926
I'll be waiting for the
full autopsy details.

553
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,288
How do you all get to be
such boring pen-pushers?

554
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,211
You gut a special school
fur that?

555
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,007
Your client vomited before
his death.

556
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,761
- Get toxicology tests done.
- Sure.

557
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,961
Even though the cause
of death seems obvious.

558
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,606
Lesion to the brain brought about
by a sharp instrument.

559
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,961
It was a fairly strong blow,

560
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,003
though not
sufficient tn Pierce the skull.

561
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,725
Could a woman
have delivered the blow?

562
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,968
Easily. The orbital bone is thin,

563
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,128
doesn't take much force
to Pierce it.

564
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,560
And could he have done
it himself?

565
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,728
It'd be the first time someone
killed himself...

566
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,887
Like that as far as I know.

567
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,969
But I can't rule it out
one hundred percent.

568
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,561
You read the interview records?

569
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,770
- Zilch_ nothing to go oh.
- And have you been to his ohices?

570
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,402
An inspector went. Conducted
routine questioning. Another zero.

571
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,924
He vomited before he died.

572
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,930
He was on medication.
Trankiloxil_ sedatives_.

573
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,566
There were two sets
of prints on the bottle.

574
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,683
Telak's and Barbara Jarczyk's_.

575
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,685
Excuse me.

576
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,451
- Hi, what's up?
- Can you pick Agnieszka up?

577
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,244
I'm caught up in something
at the lab.

578
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,489
But I tuck the car in fur service.

579
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,371
Hey, are you on the old square?
I can hear the bugle_.

580
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,202
Just passing by. Ok, listen,
I'll pick her up. I can't talk now.

581
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,403
I have to pick my daughter
up from school.

582
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,570
- I'll run you there.
- If I go now, I can still make it.

583
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,205
It's no problem.

584
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,209
I've called Jarczyk
back for further questioning.

585
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,243
Her fingerprints en that bottle
need explaining.

586
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,523
And we have to interview
Telak's wife and the son.

587
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,241
Have a look at the video
of the therapy.

588
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,807
You believe that stuff?
Give me a break...

589
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,809
The hellinger method was
banned in Germany...

590
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,004
- Alter a girl in leipzig killed herself.
- It could be the same here,

591
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,204
if it turns out that Telak stabbed
himself in the eye with that skewer.

592
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,765
Remember when kashpirovsky
was doing...

593
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,371
His psychic healing thing
on television?

594
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,005
This grandma in poznan...

595
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,124
Was watching the program.
She was alone in the apartment,

596
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,891
five locks on the door,
all locked, windows tight shut.

597
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,526
The program finished and...

598
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,487
It turns out her gold watch
was gone.

599
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,446
Hi!

600
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,765
That's not daddy.

601
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,681
I'm slawek_ your Mom's driver.

602
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,931
Daddy said he couldn't make it.
I had tn come from the office...

603
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,124
But daddy promised we'd gn
fur cream puffs after school.

604
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,926
No problem.
We'll go for cream puh's_.

605
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,884
Well, ok then, I guess.

606
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,530
Thanks.
You didn't have to do that.

607
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,361
You've got a great daughter.

608
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,850
Thanks.

609
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,169
For your mercy is boundless.

610
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,761
Give us always to remember
that our life is but short..

611
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,849
And the hour of our death
hidden from us.

612
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,361
May the holy spirit
guide us through this world...

613
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,971
In sanctity and righteousness,

614
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,527
that we may serve you
in the community of your church,

615
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,200
steadfast in faith,
and with the full solace of hope...

616
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,167
That we may come at last in joy
tn your kingdom.

617
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,523
Through Jesus Christ our lord,
amen.

618
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,526
Let's get out of here.
Wolniak's taking photos.

619
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,690
Maybe we could head out
of town for a while?

620
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,764
It's Saturday.

621
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,167
I know this great new bar
out in lanckoroni_.

622
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:33,610
For Saturday downtime, I have a family.
And friends, if need be.

623
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:37,125
We'll stick tn a working
relationship.

624
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,691
Please accept
my sincere condolences.

625
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,601
You have no respect for the dead.

626
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,768
Have some self-respect,
at least.

627
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,407
- Take it easy. I'm police.
- Such are the police today.

628
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,090
- Gimme the card.
- Back off...

629
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,930
Gimme the card.

630
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,127
My husband was depressed.
I knew he was in treatment,

631
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,687
but he never shared
the details with me.

632
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,805
I never met dr rudzki or any
of the patients, either.

633
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,083
Why did your daughter
commit suicide?

634
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,964
Do I have to talk about that?

635
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:33,051
This interview concerns
a homicide.

636
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:40,644
Why does a fiiieen-year-old decide
to swallow a bottle of pills?

637
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,407
Even God wouldn't be able
to answerthat question.

638
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,007
We thought it was a heart attack.

639
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,688
But we found a letter.

640
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,205
"Lvly Darling parents, don't be upset
I love you all,

641
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,927
and you, daddy, most of all."

642
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,209
'You, daddy'
was in capital letters.

643
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,201
How did your husband take it?

644
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,248
He as good as died.
Ended up in hospital.

645
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,049
Did he feel guilty?

646
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,408
I know I'm being questioned
in a homicide case,

647
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,250
but could you possibly curb
the number...

648
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,529
Of foolish questions, lieutenant?
Of course he felt guilty.

649
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,166
I felt guilty, too.
I feel guilty all the time.

650
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,050
Did you blame your husband
for your daughter's death?

651
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,521
- I don't understand the question.
- It's a simple one.

652
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,168
In her letter, she wrote that
she especially loved her father.

653
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,721
Maybe their relations
were closer?

654
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,965
What the fuck are you insinuating,
lieutenant?

655
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,443
What have you concocted in that...

656
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,849
Fucking twisted policeman's
head of yours?

657
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,726
Answer the question, please.

658
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,129
She loved her father more than
anyone else in the family.

659
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,043
When she killed herself,
the greater part of henryk died.

660
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:39,482
The murderer didn't so much kill
him as deliverthe final blow.

661
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,564
Good morning.

662
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,331
I'm sorry, but we're not taking
new orders at the moment.

663
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:07,566
I'm a prosecutor.
I'm investigating mr Telak's case.

664
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,165
Yeah, right.

665
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,569
It's landed on my plate
and I only started here six months ago.

666
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,521
The police have already been.

667
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,326
I told them I don't know who could
have killed lvlrtelak_.

668
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,887
- He was such a quiet man.
- And yet...

669
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:26,090
I'd like to see your recent orders.
Did he leave any private notes?

670
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,368
No, no.
Mr Telak never made notes.

671
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,360
- He recorded everything en his mp3.
- Ah. And where is it, this ivip3?

672
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,921
Not here.
He always kept it with him.

673
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,610
What did it look like?

674
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,202
Kind of small and black,
with a silver control disk.

675
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,811
Thank you very much.

676
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,960
The police already searched here.

677
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,851
They took all
the gentleman's things.

678
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,168
- He had a recorder.
- Say what?

679
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,362
Like a tiny tape recorder.

680
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:19,969
There wereh't no tape recorder here.
I'd have noticed.

681
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,646
The police would've found it.

682
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,600
Sure, but he must have had
it with him.

683
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,768
Maybe it's in a diiferent room?

684
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,369
Like, I don't know what
a tape recorder looks like?

685
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,523
The cleaner found a hearing aid...

686
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,768
When she was cleaning
under the bed,

687
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,247
but that had to be the previous
occupant's_.

688
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,362
Where is it?

689
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,451
Actually, I was meant to phone
the gentleman from the police,

690
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,688
only I mislaid___

691
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,648
- the phone number.
- Excuse me.

692
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,845
May 23rd_
p00/grafex meeting with...

693
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,765
Printers' inks wholesaler;
Poffarb_

694
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,847
Saturday June 4th,
time: 11 pm.

695
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,200
I have to check.
Am I dreaming this?

696
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,602
Daddy. Daddy.

697
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,847
Is that you, princess?

698
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,004
Daddy.

699
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,606
What's that? More of the therapy?
Whose voice is that?

700
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,485
No. It was recorded at night,
in his room.

701
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,929
Listen to the final recording.

702
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,565
Sunday, June 5th,
time: Five after midnight.

703
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,928
To my wife, jadwiga.

704
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,563
I apologize for talking to you
like this

705
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,121
/t'd be easier to write a letter

706
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,169
I've nothing left to /ive for.

707
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,246
You don? Love me.
Maybe even hate me.

708
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,529
I found out today...

709
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,725
That I'm to blame for kasia's death
and bartek's illness.

710
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,927
Don't worry about money.

711
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,164
Igor runs a trust fund for me.

712
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,961
You're authorized to use
the account.

713
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,123
They've also got my policy.

714
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:19,770
We have a kind of mutual
insurance society.

715
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,561
The money'// he/p
with bartek's operation...

716
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,082
If the chance comes up
for a transplant abroad.

717
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:30,326
Bye, Darling.

718
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,802
I always loved you more
than you thought.

719
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,161
I don't believe it was suicide.
Can you picture it?

720
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:44,762
A guy records a letter of farewell,
then swallows some tablets,

721
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,486
but gives up on the idea a moment
later and vomits his guts up.

722
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,241
Gets dressed, packs, leaves.
But then changes his mind again,

723
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,329
and sticks a skewer in his eye.

724
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,760
Have forensics run a phonoscopic
analysis.

725
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,685
We need to know who was pretending
to be his daughter.

726
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,451
And I'll find out who Igor is.

727
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,811
- And the investigation's version?
- As I predicted, boss.

728
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,367
Henryk was murdered
by one of the patients...

729
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,282
Under the influence of emotions
related to the therapy.

730
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,606
People kill because they're drunk,

731
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,407
or for money, or under orders,
or out of political necessity.

732
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,165
And the prosecutor?

733
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:29,761
Routine blah, blah, blah.
I wouldn't worry about it.

734
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,923
- Why?
- Why?

735
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,164
They're questioning the family,
the patients, his customers.

736
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,169
I don't think that poses
any dangerto us.

737
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,488
We'll keep ourfinger
on the pulse.

738
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,242
All right. You can go.

739
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,767
Do you know what a
phonoscopic analysis is?

740
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,530
Kind of like fingerprints?
Right? Something with the voice?

741
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:58,804
Telak had a habit of
recording everything.

742
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,647
He recorded something crucial
to the investigation.

743
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,964
I wouldn't want to hear it.

744
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:10,364
It seemed to him that
he was hallucinating_.

745
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,250
He recorded it.

746
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,482
A conversation between Telak
and his dead daughter.

747
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:22,526
We sent the material for analysis.
The results are unequivocal.

748
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,765
The person who stood
outside Telak's door...

749
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,566
Pretending to be his daughter
was you.

750
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,562
Is this some kind of a joke?

751
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,440
No. It's impossible.
I don't believe it.

752
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:39,206
This isn't a matter
of what you believe.

753
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,370
You stand outside Telak's door
pretending to be his daughter,

754
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,210
pleading with him to come to you.

755
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,728
Telak's driven to such despair
that he records a suicide leiler___

756
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,366
and then swallows
a boitleful of sedatives.

757
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,567
The facts suggest...

758
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,001
That since you failed to induce
him to commit suicide,

759
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,282
you decided to kill him yourself.

760
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,370
If you do nothing to clear this up,

761
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,369
you'll be leaving here to be
detained.

762
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:03,365
This is some kind of bad dream.
It can't be true,

763
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,284
no, it lust can't be.

764
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,882
Daddy. Daddy.

765
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,562
Is that you, princess?

766
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,009
/miss you, daddy.

767
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,646
/miss you too, princess.

768
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,249
I have to go now.

769
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,846
Well?

770
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,490
I'm listening.

771
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,842
It's my voice...

772
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:40,364
But they're not my words.

773
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,411
I just remember that...
That evening...

774
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,962
I brushed my teeth with my finger...

775
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,527
Because I'd forgotten
my toothbrush.

776
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:52,042
And then I went to bed.

777
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,604
I mean, I'm not a somnambulist
I don't walk in my sleep.

778
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,849
I don't know
how to explain this.

779
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,850
This is an arrest warrant

780
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,646
I shan't sign it yet.
But you are the chief suspect.

781
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,002
Please don't leave the city
and don't talk to anyone.

782
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,565
The slightest shadow of suspicion...

783
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,330
That you're hampering
the investigation...

784
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,285
And you'll be detained
that very same day.

785
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,803
Yes. I understand.

786
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,160
I won't hamper anything.

787
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,163
I'm as anxious as anyone fur this
tn be cleared up.

788
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,888
You can go now.

789
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,728
Give her a guardian angel.

790
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,445
Just a moment.

791
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:50,367
You can go in.
The prosecutor's waiting.

792
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,521
They won't let you out
without this.

793
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,803
Sit down, please.

794
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,122
I have two questions.

795
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,562
Do you use sedatives?

796
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,649
I don't understand.
Yes, I use them.

797
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:14,810
But doesn't everyone over the age
of fihy these days?

798
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,001
Often?

799
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,170
Rarely, now.
I took some yesterday, though.

800
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:24,569
But there was a time when I had
to take a pill every night.

801
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,371
Which is one of the reasons
I ended up with dr rudzki_.

802
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,331
- What do you take?
- Trankiloxil_

803
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,485
it's a French medication.

804
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,049
- Do you know why I'm asking?
- No.

805
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,291
An empty trankilnxil bottle
was found in mr Telak's Mum.

806
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,847
The pathologist has ascertained
that mr telak___

807
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,769
took a large dose shortly
before his death.

808
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,770
Yourfingerprints are on that bottle.

809
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,804
Dear God.

810
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,531
Now I remember.

811
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,050
But surely you don't think
thatl could have...

812
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:05,244
Well, I have to confess that
such a thought did enter my head.

813
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,608
Dear God,
how can one take it all in?

814
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,604
The therapy, that corpse,

815
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,041
the police and everything,
this interview...

816
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:15,881
What was it you forgot
to tell us?

817
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,968
On Saturday, after supper,

818
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,891
I ran into lvlrtelak in the corridor.

819
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,891
He said he was very tense
and asked if...

820
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,048
I had anything
that would help him sleep.

821
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,520
So, well,

822
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,845
- I gave him that bottle.
- How many pills were there?

823
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,164
- Over half. There are thirty to a bottle.
- And you weren't afraid that,

824
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,328
in the state he was in,
he'd take the lot?

825
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,443
It would never have entered
my head.

826
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,965
“So I thought that perhaps
someone had done him a kindness.

827
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,123
Well, because
there couldn't be any world...

828
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,641
"Where he'd be worse 011
than he was here."

829
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,569
Those are your words.
Tell me,

830
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,206
"did you give mr Telak
more tablets than he needed-"

831
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:58,368
in order tn transport him
tn a better world?

832
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,131
- What you're saying is despicable.
- Really?

833
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,966
In any case, why did you
conceal the maher of the tablets...

834
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,730
When you were being
questioned before?

835
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,843
It would have stuck
in my memory...

836
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,163
- Are you through?
- Yes, in point of fact.

837
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,761
You are the chief suspect.
I shan't arrest you today,

838
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,367
but please don't leave the city
and don't talk to anyone.

839
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:18,164
The slightest shadow of suspicion...

840
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,169
That you're hampering
the investigation...

841
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:22,089
And I'll lock you
up without hesitating.

842
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,567
I understand and I won't
hamperthe investigation.

843
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,211
Well,

844
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,564
we've put the cat
among the pigeons.

845
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,286
Now for some discreet
surveillance.

846
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,451
And bug their mobiles.

847
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,810
It's done.

848
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,609
What're you thinking about?

849
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,325
About you.

850
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,209
- Something's happened?
- No.

851
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,287
So? What, specifically?

852
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:31,246
That it'd be good
if you won the lottery.

853
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,564
I'd have to play it.

854
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,691
Come up with a system,
invest some money.

855
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,761
My deceased... he played.

856
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,607
He had the coupons in his wallet.
The same numbers every week.

857
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,565
- And he didn't win.
- No.

858
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,082
That's how people bet.

859
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,802
The date of their wedding
ortheir kid's birthday.

860
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,642
Utterly moronic.

861
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,606
Why would a machine pick out
the exact date of someone's wedding.

862
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,523
7,8,9,17,19.
It can't be a birthday...

863
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:12,323
- Goto sleep.
- Adds up to 82.8 and 2 is 10.

864
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,484
1 plus zero is 1.
It's meaningless...

865
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,890
Hello?

866
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,042
Hi, Agata.

867
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,641
I'm sure those numbers
stand for a date. I can sense it!

868
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,205
I checked all the dates on file...

869
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,164
And only one matches up
with some of the numbers.

870
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,010
The date on his daughters
suicide leiler_.

871
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,362
Only, I don't know, could a guy
be crazy enough to choose...

872
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,564
The date of his own child's suicide
as lucky numbers for the lottery?

873
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,762
I never ran an investigation
with a woman before.

874
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,007
I'll have to get used to it.

875
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,282
It opens up a whole
new bunch of possibilities.
