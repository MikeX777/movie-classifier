1
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:16,820
( music playing )

2
00:04:14,304 --> 00:04:16,306
( dogs barking )

3
00:04:21,278 --> 00:04:23,280
( woman screams on TV )

4
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,390
( both laugh )

5
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:37,127
THAT MARLIN, MAN,
HE IS ONE BAD FISH.

6
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:40,030
( laughter )

7
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:43,333
Priest:
BOYS,

8
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,270
THE HOUR
IS DRAWING NEAR.

9
00:04:46,303 --> 00:04:47,905
DON'T YOU THINK
WE COULD BE MAKING

10
00:04:47,938 --> 00:04:50,808
A LITTLE BIT BETTER
USE OF THIS TIME?

11
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:53,977
WELL, FILL ME IN
ON THE PROTOCOL, PADRE.

12
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:56,346
HOW EXACTLY
DO WE DO THAT?

13
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,948
WELL, YOU MIGHT
CONTEMPLATE

14
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,950
THE NATURE
OF YOUR CRIMES.

15
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,953
REPENT OF YOUR SINS.

16
00:05:02,986 --> 00:05:05,889
- YOU HEAR THAT, L.H.?
- YEAH.

17
00:05:05,923 --> 00:05:09,226
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
THINKING ABOUT ALL THE BAD,
BAD THINGS WE'VE DONE.

18
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:10,928
- OH.
-( screaming on TV continues )

19
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,832
( both laugh )

20
00:05:19,103 --> 00:05:21,338
YOU KNOW WHAT, FATHER?

21
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:23,307
YOU'RE RIGHT.

22
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,375
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA.

23
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,777
HEY, HEY, HEY, LOOK!
IT'S US!

24
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,180
Christy Carruthers:
The executioner's song
is playing tonight

25
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:32,416
for the bloodthirsty
Burne Brothers.

26
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,386
The eyes of the nation
are on Metro City as these
sadistic siblings

27
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,923
await side-by-side seats
in the electric chair.

28
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:42,326
"Mad Dog"
and "Little Henry" Burne

29
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,294
were the first criminals
to be convicted

30
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:47,998
under the city's controversial
anti-firearms amendment

31
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:51,969
for their part in
the Metro City Mall robbery
two years ago,

32
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,838
which ended in the massacre
of six bystanders

33
00:05:54,872 --> 00:05:57,975
and three
Metro police officers.

34
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:00,144
Ironically,
the brothers' fates

35
00:06:00,177 --> 00:06:03,514
now rest in the hands
of the very person who
led the crusade

36
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:06,016
to abolish all weapons
within the Metro City limits,

37
00:06:06,049 --> 00:06:07,851
Mayor Eleanor Grimbaum.

38
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:11,188
Early today,
by order of the governor,

39
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:14,358
Grimbaum was given penal
jurisdiction in the matter.

40
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,993
Only a phone call
from her

41
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,295
can save
the condemned men now.

42
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,532
( TV clicks off )

43
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,609
( dials )

44
00:06:35,946 --> 00:06:38,448
MR. LEE,
IT'S MAYOR GRIMBAUM.

45
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:39,950
IT'S NOT TOO LATE, IS IT?

46
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,419
OH, THANK GOD.

47
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:44,922
MM, GOOD. GOOD.

48
00:06:44,955 --> 00:06:47,991
UH, ADD A SESAME CHICKEN

49
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:49,893
AND A PORK RICE TO THAT,
WOULD YOU?

50
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:53,931
- MM. FRIED.
- ( chuckles )

51
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,069
-
( flashbulbs clicking ) 
-
( hushed whispering )

52
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:13,450
( metallic squeaks )

53
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,887
( yells )

54
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:29,566
( chatter )

55
00:07:31,401 --> 00:07:33,403
( gate creaks )

56
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:43,580
ONE QUESTION--

57
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:45,582
HOW SHALL I SERVE YOU?

58
00:07:45,616 --> 00:07:48,151
COME AGAIN, WARDEN?

59
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,656
AFTER YOU'RE COOKED.

60
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:56,960
SHALL I SERVE YOU
WITH POTATOES OR STUFFING?

61
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,733
WELL, DON'T GO PREHEATIN'
YOUR OVEN JUST YET.

62
00:08:02,766 --> 00:08:05,002
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE
OF DINNER PLANS.

63
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,703
( yells )

64
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,244
( screaming )

65
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:21,985
( yells, laughs )

66
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:28,692
DAVID COPPERFIELD
DOESN'T HAVE SHIT ON ME.

67
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:31,628
SOME LAST-MINUTE SUBSTITUTIONS
IN THE CAST TONIGHT, FOLKS.

68
00:08:34,031 --> 00:08:36,333
ROLL IT, HENRY.

69
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,368
( screaming )

70
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:05,228
SORRY, NO REFUNDS.

71
00:09:08,632 --> 00:09:10,634
( screams )

72
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:23,580
- MOVE IT!
- I WANNA SEE THOSE
  FUCKERS DANCE AROUND AGAIN.

73
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,182
COME ON, DROP IT,
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

74
00:09:25,215 --> 00:09:27,617
- ONE MORE TIME.
- NO!

75
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,130
-
( sirens blaring ) 
-
( music playing ) 

76
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,434
( motorcycles revving )

77
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:12,562
( chatting, laughing )

78
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:14,798
- ( gang cheers greetings )
- MAD DOG!

79
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:17,067
HEY! MAD DOG!

80
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,615
WHOO!

81
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:38,088
IT'S SHOWTIME.

82
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,151
WHAT A SORRY BUNCH

83
00:11:09,553 --> 00:11:10,821
OF DRUG ADDICTS,

84
00:11:12,222 --> 00:11:16,226
- DEGENERATES, AND WHORES.
- Man:
YEAH.

85
00:11:19,463 --> 00:11:22,332
- DAMN, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK!
- ( gang cheers )

86
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:27,838
I WANT TO THANK SKIN
HERE FOR--

87
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,909
WELL, FOR RUNNING THINGS
FOR ME WHILE I'VE BEEN
ON VACATION.

88
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:38,215
- HE'S DONE A DAMN GOOD JOB.
- ( applause )

89
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:45,255
NOW, SKIN ASSURES ME THAT--
WELL, NOW THAT I'M BACK,

90
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:49,459
THE TRANSITION
OF POWER,

91
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:53,497
WELL, WILL BE
A SMOOTH ONE.

92
00:11:56,766 --> 00:11:57,934
-
( crowd cheers) 
- ( gags )

93
00:11:59,002 --> 00:12:01,905
LATER, SKINS.
( laughs )

94
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:04,274
( gang cheers, laughs )

95
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:11,581
NOW, IF YOU
WANT TO ROB ME

96
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:13,817
AND STEAL FROM ME,

97
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,520
GOD BLESS YOU.

98
00:12:16,553 --> 00:12:19,456
JUST, UH, WELL,

99
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,691
- JUST DON'T GET CAUGHT.
- ( crowd laughs )

100
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,896
ALL RIGHT.

101
00:12:27,464 --> 00:12:29,633
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR CELEBRATION.

102
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,805
MY BROTHER IS DEAD.

103
00:12:39,276 --> 00:12:42,279
AND HIS BLOOD
IS ON THE HANDS

104
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,014
OF THAT
FUCKING WOMAN

105
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,550
WHO PUT US
IN THAT HOLE

106
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,019
AND TRIED
TO SHUT US DOWN.

107
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:51,855
WELL,

108
00:12:51,888 --> 00:12:53,790
TONIGHT...

109
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:56,726
WE'RE GOING TO RIP THE TITS
OFF THAT FUCKING BITCH

110
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,762
- AT CITY HALL!
- ( gang cheers )

111
00:13:01,364 --> 00:13:03,366
( music playing )

112
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:05,869
Man:
GET RID OF HER.

113
00:13:19,749 --> 00:13:22,919
-( dispatch chatter ) 
- You're new.

114
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,861
You know what?

115
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:37,634
I'M GONNA ENJOY
BREAKING YOU IN.

116
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:41,705
( gang laughs )

117
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,707
( dispatch chatter )

118
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,924
THAT SON OF A BITCH LANDED
RIGHT IN OUR LAPS!

119
00:14:02,826 --> 00:14:04,327
You know,
you better warn the mayor

120
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:06,396
because they're
coming after her tonight.

121
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,431
( pipe clanging )

122
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,901
I'M TELLING YOU

123
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,804
if I can isolate Mad Dog,
I'm taking him out.

124
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,808
NO, DON'T
DO ANYTHING STUPID.

125
00:14:18,842 --> 00:14:21,845
( sighs )

126
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:23,813
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU LIKE THE LEATHER
FOR THE WEDDING

127
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,849
or you into
the traditional white?

128
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:27,984
ALYSSA, NOW DON'T
DO ANYTHING CRAZY.

129
00:14:28,018 --> 00:14:29,753
- JUST WAIT,
  WAIT FOR BACKUP.
- I got to go.

130
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:34,891
ALYSSA, WAIT FOR BACK--
SHE NEVER WAITS.

131
00:14:36,026 --> 00:14:38,128
IT'S ABOUT
FREAKIN' TIME.

132
00:14:38,161 --> 00:14:41,598
WHAT WAS YOU DOIN'?
CHECKIN' FOR WORMS?

133
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,366
DON'T MAKE ME
HURT YOU, BOXER.

134
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,936
OH, YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
WHEN BALLERINAS GROW
BALLS, RIGHT?

135
00:14:48,605 --> 00:14:50,106
WHEN BALLERINAS
GROW BALLS.

136
00:14:51,574 --> 00:14:53,943
( sirens blaring )

137
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,979
( music playing )

138
00:15:01,685 --> 00:15:03,153
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
CUT TO THE CHASE.

139
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:04,888
PRESS IS TRYING
TO CRUCIFY ME.

140
00:15:04,921 --> 00:15:07,157
HOW DID THEY GET
SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE?

141
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,426
HOW DID THEY GET
FIREARMS PAST THE SCANNERS?

142
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:10,760
ANSWER ME THAT, HIGGINS.

143
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:13,129
UH, WE DON'T KNOW YET,
YOUR HONOR.

144
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:15,598
WELL, I'VE GOT
SCANNERS EVERYWHERE.

145
00:15:15,632 --> 00:15:17,534
I'VE EVEN GOT ONE
AT MY GYNECOLOGIST'S OFFICE,

146
00:15:17,567 --> 00:15:19,602
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.

147
00:15:19,636 --> 00:15:22,138
HOW DID THEY GET PAST
THE ONES IN METRO PEN?

148
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,841
WE BELIEVE IT WAS
A PLASTIC WEAPON, MA'AM.

149
00:15:24,874 --> 00:15:26,576
OR A RESIN COMPOUND.

150
00:15:27,777 --> 00:15:29,713
FROM THE REMAINING TRACES
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO--

151
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,414
Grimbaum:
YEAH, YEAH, WHATEVER.

152
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,416
WHAT ARE WE DOING
TO FIND MAD DOG?

153
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,653
WELL, WE'VE GOT
A G6 MO-TECH UNIT
ON THE SCENE AT THE PRISON.

154
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:38,188
UH, THEY'RE SEEING
WHAT THEY CAN DIG UP

155
00:15:38,221 --> 00:15:40,790
AND, UH, WE'VE ALERTED
THE U.C.s IN THE FIELD.

156
00:15:40,824 --> 00:15:42,992
WHAT THE HELL
ARE "U.C.s"?

157
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:45,095
UNDERCOVER OPERATIVES.

158
00:15:45,128 --> 00:15:48,865
WOULD YOU CUT
THE MATT HELM SHIT, CHIEF?

159
00:15:48,898 --> 00:15:51,501
YOU-- HONEY,

160
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:55,038
I AM DOING A
PRESS CONFERENCE,
NOT "OTHELLO."

161
00:15:55,071 --> 00:15:56,773
WOULD YOU BLEND THIS?!

162
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:03,179
NOW LOOK, BOYS,
MARK MY WORDS,

163
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,548
IF I GO
DOWN ON THIS,

164
00:16:05,582 --> 00:16:07,784
I SHALL DO
SO WITH MY NAILS

165
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:10,887
FIRMLY IMPLANTED
INTO YOUR BALLS.

166
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,956
HAVE YOU GOT THAT?!

167
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:18,895
THIS IS
AN ELECTION YEAR.

168
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:21,965
MY APPROVAL RATING'S
AT 33%. OW!

169
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,836
AND THAT WAS BEFORE
MAD DOG ESCAPED.

170
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,639
Man:
31%.

171
00:16:33,109 --> 00:16:35,845
I HAVE NO TIME
FOR KISS-ASSES, PROFESSOR.

172
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:37,814
HOW CAN
I HELP YOU?

173
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,217
PERHAPS WE SHOULD DISCUSS
HOW I CAN HELP YOU.

174
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,586
Higgins:
AND WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

175
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:44,988
LAZARUS.

176
00:16:46,689 --> 00:16:48,892
OH, THE PROM
IS OVER, JACK.

177
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:51,728
STOP ASKING ME
TO DANCE.

178
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:54,931
EVEN IF I TOTALLY APPROVE
THE LAZARUS PROJECT,
WHICH I DON'T,

179
00:16:54,964 --> 00:16:57,233
THERE'S NO MONEY
IN THE BUDGET TO SUPPORT IT.

180
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,969
- SHE'S RIGHT.
- I SUGGEST YOU FIND IT.

181
00:17:01,905 --> 00:17:03,706
OR ELSE?

182
00:17:05,575 --> 00:17:07,777
OR ELSE THE VOTERS
WILL LOOK AT YOU
AS THE WOMAN

183
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:09,846
WHO GAVE METRO CITY
BACK TO THE CRIMINALS.

184
00:17:09,879 --> 00:17:12,849
THAT'S HARDLY FAIR.

185
00:17:12,882 --> 00:17:14,784
AT THE TIME,
WE ALL REACTED FAVORABLY

186
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:15,952
TO THE CIVIL
UNREST AMENDMENT.

187
00:17:15,985 --> 00:17:17,687
IF OTHER MEASURES
WERE TAKEN

188
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,656
IN CONJUNCTION WITH
THE ABOLISHMENT OF GUNS.

189
00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:21,724
LAZARUS WAS
ONE OF THOSE MEASURES.

190
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:24,527
YOU HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD
ON THIS, IT'S A MATTER
OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

191
00:17:24,561 --> 00:17:26,529
( phone ringing )

192
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,566
YES?

193
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,835
YES. THE MAYOR?

194
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,243
IS THIS A RELIABLE SOURCE?

195
00:17:41,845 --> 00:17:44,013
STRANGE TIME
TO BE WASHING WINDOWS.

196
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,688
- ( yells )
-
( music playing )

197
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,602
( screams )

198
00:18:15,612 --> 00:18:17,146
( screams )

199
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:26,656
( groans )

200
00:18:32,228 --> 00:18:34,831
PROFESSOR CROWLEY,
PLEASE PUT YOUR GUN
ON THE TABLE

201
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:36,666
AND PUT YOUR
HANDS BEHIND
YOUR BACK.

202
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:38,801
YOU'RE IN VIOLATION
OF THE CIVIL UNREST
AMENDMENT.

203
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:40,770
BLOW IT OUT
YOUR ASS, HIGGINS!

204
00:18:40,803 --> 00:18:43,840
I'M GREEN-LIGHTING
LAZARUS AS OF NOW.

205
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:48,011
OTHER THAN A CHECK,
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

206
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,946
A CANDIDATE.

207
00:18:54,918 --> 00:18:56,853
( music playing )

208
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:00,256
( crowd cheering )

209
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,361
( phone ringing )

210
00:19:09,265 --> 00:19:10,800
HELLO?

211
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,039
IT'S OUR FRIEND.

212
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,979
YEAH?

213
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:35,058
YEAH,
I'M LISTENING.

214
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,883
BAD NEWS
FROM CITY HALL?

215
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,125
SHE'S ALIVE.

216
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,796
WHAT HAPPENED?

217
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,334
- THERE'S A RAT ON BOARD.
- Man:
A RAT?

218
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:20,770
- FLUSH IT OUT.
- ( gang chatters )

219
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:28,811
Man:
IT'S NOT ME.
ARE YOU A RAT?

220
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,262
WHAT?

221
00:20:47,964 --> 00:20:50,800
YOU WERE INSIDE
A LONG TIME AND I
WAS JUST THINKING--

222
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,835
YEAH, WELL, I GOT
A LOT ON MY MIND.

223
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,839
GO DOWN ON ME.
MAKE IT QUICK.

224
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:04,280
WELL, CAN'T WE GO
SOMEWHERE A LITTLE
MORE PRIVATE?

225
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:15,892
DON'T. JEEZ!

226
00:21:32,008 --> 00:21:33,142
( groans )

227
00:21:33,176 --> 00:21:35,545
ARGH!

228
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:38,881
SHE NEVER WAITS,
SHE NEVER WAITS.

229
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:40,416
THIS IS U.C. 159 TO DISPATCH.

230
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:42,852
WE GOT TROUBLE. 

231
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,990
YOU KNOW WHAT?

232
00:21:48,024 --> 00:21:50,026
YOU GOT NICE EYES.

233
00:22:03,272 --> 00:22:05,308
( screaming )

234
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:15,284
- SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

235
00:22:22,125 --> 00:22:23,192
AUDIO?

236
00:22:29,999 --> 00:22:31,501
HM-MM?

237
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:33,035
( screams )

238
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:39,242
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE RANGE IS ON SOMETHING
THIS SMALL, HUH?

239
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:41,310
CAN'T BE TOO FAR.

240
00:22:41,344 --> 00:22:43,513
CHECK IT OUT.

241
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:44,547

242
00:22:46,983 --> 00:22:49,152

246
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,033
Man:
SOMEBODY WOKE UP
ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE BED.
( laughter )

247
00:23:09,272 --> 00:23:11,440
ENOUGH!
TAKE A SEAT, PIG!

248
00:23:13,943 --> 00:23:14,911
I SMELL BACON.

249
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,979

WELL, THIS IS
MY MOST PRIZED POSSESSION.

- Man #2: EVERYONE OUT.

350
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,776
Nurse:
GET THESE GUYS
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

351
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:02,444
- Man #2:
GOOD? LET'S GET
HER OUT. 
- Man:
GOT IT.

352
00:31:02,478 --> 00:31:03,779
Man #2:
MOVE. LET'S GO.

353
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,417
ROLL ON, ROLL ON.
LET'S GO.

354
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,826
Crowley:
IT'S BEEN 72 HOURS SINCE
THE FUNERAL OF ALYSSA LLOYD.

355
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,595
THE FIRST PHASE
OF THE PROCESS

356
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,797
HAS MET WITH
CONSIDERABLE SUCCESS.

357
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,734
ALL LIFE SIGNS
APPEAR FUNCTIONAL.

358
00:31:25,768 --> 00:31:27,770
THE REST IS UP TO HER. 

359
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,125
GOOD MORNING, MISS LLOYD.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

360
00:31:54,563 --> 00:31:55,998
WHERE AM I?

361
00:31:56,031 --> 00:31:57,833
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU ARE?

362
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:03,872
- AM I DEAD?
- YOU WERE.

363
00:32:03,906 --> 00:32:05,107
MY CONDOLENCES.

364
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:08,811
BREAKFAST?

365
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,082
WHERE'S MY PARTNER?

366
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:15,818
SERGEANT DUPRE
IS AT CITY GENERAL.

367
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:17,653
HE'S VEGETATIVE.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

368
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:24,760
WHO ARE YOU?

369
00:32:24,793 --> 00:32:26,762
I'M PROFESSOR
JACK CROWLEY.

370
00:32:26,795 --> 00:32:28,630
I'M IN CHARGE
OF THE LAZARUS PROJECT.

371
00:32:28,664 --> 00:32:30,432
YEAH? WHAT THE HELL'S THAT?

372
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:32,735
AT THE MOMENT, YOU.

373
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:35,571
LOOK, COULD YOU
BE MORE SPECIFIC?

374
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:39,808
( gasps )

375
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,879
LOOK AT YOUR HAND.

376
00:32:53,822 --> 00:32:55,958
IN THIS NEW AGE
OF BIO-MOLECULAR
MECHANICS,

377
00:32:57,826 --> 00:32:59,962
THIS IS GOD.

378
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,233
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?

379
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:07,669
REPLACED YOUR BLOOD
WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL
PLASMIC SERUM

380
00:33:07,703 --> 00:33:09,838
OF ENGINEERED PROTEINS.

381
00:33:09,872 --> 00:33:12,775
THINK OF THEM
AS MICROSCOPIC MACHINES

382
00:33:12,808 --> 00:33:14,676
THAT WORK IN CONJUNCTION
WITH YOUR BRAIN

383
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:18,647
TO STIMULATE
LIFE FUNCTIONS
IN DEAD TISSUE.

384
00:33:22,551 --> 00:33:24,186
DEAD TISSUE?

385
00:33:24,219 --> 00:33:25,854
SO, WHAT, YOU'RE
DR. FRANKENSTEIN?

386
00:33:25,888 --> 00:33:27,823
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MAKE ME?

387
00:33:27,856 --> 00:33:30,058
I'M A SCIENTIST,
NOT A PHILOSOPHER.

388
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:32,928
I'VE BEEN COMMISSIONED
TO CREATE A SOLIDER
OF JUSTICE.

389
00:33:32,961 --> 00:33:34,930
SOMEONE TO WAGE WAR
ON THE CRIMINALS
OF THE CITY

390
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:37,733
WITH ABSURDLY
EXTREME PREJUDICE.

391
00:33:40,702 --> 00:33:42,538
NO. SORRY TO INFORM YOU,
PROFESSOR,

392
00:33:42,571 --> 00:33:44,873
BUT I RETIRED,
OKAY?

393
00:33:44,907 --> 00:33:47,609
I THINK THAT
THAT OPTION COMES
RIGHT ALONG WITH DEATH.

394
00:33:49,912 --> 00:33:52,815
NOT ACCORDING
TO RIDER

395
00:33:52,848 --> 00:33:55,851
48c OF YOUR
CONTRACT.

396
00:33:57,186 --> 00:33:59,888
WHAT? THAT'S, LIKE,
AN ORGAN DONATION ADDENDUM.

397
00:33:59,922 --> 00:34:01,723
YES, EXACTLY.

398
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:03,725
IN THE EVENT OF
AN ON-THE-JOB FATALITY,

399
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:04,827
YOUR BODY
BELONGS TO THE CITY.

400
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,094
IS THAT
YOUR SIGNATURE?

401
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:16,738
( music playing )

402
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:42,965
WHY? HERE TO CONFESS
FOR A LIFETIME
OF SINNING?

403
00:34:44,266 --> 00:34:47,736
I DON'T THINK
I'M QUITE READY
TO MEET THE MAKER YET.

404
00:34:48,971 --> 00:34:52,007
DESPITE YOUR SURPRISE
ATTACK ON CITY HALL.

405
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,209
I MEAN,
YOU ALMOST DID ME IN.

406
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:57,579
- YOU MEAN YOU DIDN'T
  GET THE NEWSLETTER?
- ( scoffs )

407
00:34:57,613 --> 00:35:00,616
VERY FUNNY, ASSHOLE.

408
00:35:00,649 --> 00:35:02,684
PLEASE, HIGGS.
THE LANGUAGE.

409
00:35:02,718 --> 00:35:04,887
THIS
IS 
THE HOUSE OF GOD.

410
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:08,056
LOOK, PAL.

411
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,027
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME
YOUR ASS WOULD BE
FRIED WONTON.

412
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,696
-
YOU OWE ME. 
- LITTLE ADAM
  DOESN'T OWE YOU.

413
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:15,831
HE'S DEAD.

414
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:18,100
GOD REST HIS SOUL.

415
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,702
I'M SORRY.

416
00:35:20,736 --> 00:35:22,571
BUT THAT WASN'T
MY FAULT.

417
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:25,741
I WANT MORE.

418
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:28,043
I WANT A FULL
PARTNERSHIP.

419
00:35:31,046 --> 00:35:32,714
A FULL PARTNERSHIP?

420
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,984
WELL, WELL, WELL.

421
00:35:36,018 --> 00:35:38,153
LET ME BRING IN
MY BUSINESS NEGOTIATOR.

422
00:35:43,926 --> 00:35:45,661
( dog growls )

423
00:35:50,332 --> 00:35:51,900
NEGOTIATE.

424
00:35:53,335 --> 00:35:56,838
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU--
WHAT IS THIS, HUH? HUH?

425
00:35:56,872 --> 00:35:59,141
WELL, HIGGS.
HE'S WAITIN' TO HEAR
YOUR PITCH.

426
00:36:01,243 --> 00:36:04,246
OKAY. I-- I GOT--
ACCESS TO GUNS.

427
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:07,049
CONFISCATED GUNS.
I GOT THOUSANDS OF GUNS.

428
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,850
YOU KNOW WHAT, HIGGS?
I'D PICK UP THE PACE.

429
00:36:08,884 --> 00:36:11,420
I THINK MY NEGOTIATOR'S
GETTING A LITTLE HUNGRY.

430
00:36:11,453 --> 00:36:12,821
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN. LISTEN.

431
00:36:12,854 --> 00:36:15,657
WE'LL ARM ALL
THE CRIMINALS, ALL RIGHT?

432
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:18,226
AND THERE
WILL BE TOTAL CHAOS.

433
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,929
GRIMBAUM WILL BE DEAD
IN THE NEXT ELECTION,
I PROMISE.

434
00:36:20,963 --> 00:36:23,298
OH, I THINK SHE'LL BE DEAD
WAY BEFORE THAT.

435
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:25,400
WE GET A NEW MAYOR.
THAT'S IT. WE GET
A NEW MAYOR.

436
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:28,870
HE REPEALS THE C.U.A.

437
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:31,807
I TALK TO SOME PEOPLE,
WE GOT BACKING.
A NEW MAYOR!

438
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,774
HUH?

439
00:36:32,808 --> 00:36:34,076
YOUR NEW
BUSINESS PARTNER.

440
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:37,179
ME?! HUH?

441
00:36:37,212 --> 00:36:40,916
DOWN. DOWN,
SWEETHEART. DOWN!

442
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:43,785
DON'T WANT TO BITE
OUR NEW PARTNER.

443
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:45,887
WHO NEEDS ANOTHER MAYOR
WITHOUT BALLS, HUH?

444
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,198
PULL IT BACK.

445
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:07,676
( music playing )

446
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:12,948
Crowley:
PROGRESS REPORT.

447
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,451
SUBJECT'S STRENGTH
INCREASES EVERY SESSION--

448
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:19,087
UP 52% SINCE MONDAY.

449
00:37:31,967 --> 00:37:34,770
SPEED AND EYE-HAND COORDINATION
HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED.

450
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,982
-
THE SUBJECT GOES THROUGH
SPARRING PARTNERS... 
- ( groans )

451
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,817
...LIKE HUMAN DOMINOES.

452
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,520
SHE'S BECOME
A FIERCE PREDATOR.

453
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:53,922
ITHE QUESTION IS,
WILL SHE BE ENOUGH TO SATISFY 

454
00:37:53,955 --> 00:37:55,490
THE MAYOR'S WAR ON CRIME?

455
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:04,433
I UNDERSTAND, MAYOR.

456
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:06,835
YES, I KNOW WHAT'S
GOING ON OUT THERE.

457
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,237
IT WOULDN'T BE WISE
TO RUSH THE PROCESS. THERE--

458
00:38:12,074 --> 00:38:13,308
YES.

459
00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:16,545
SINCE YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,

460
00:38:16,578 --> 00:38:19,381
YES, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

461
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,892
( music playing )

462
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:51,880
TENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
WILL COMPROMISE THE SOLUTION.

463
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:56,585
A BOOSTER TO THE JUGULAR
WILL TEMPORARILY REVERSE
THE PROCESS.

464
00:38:56,618 --> 00:38:58,386
FOR HOW LONG?

465
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,089
RESULTS VARY DEPENDING
ON THE STRESS LEVEL
OF THE SUBJECT.

466
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:04,459
YOU KNOW,
YOUR SUBJECT HAS A NAME.

467
00:39:04,493 --> 00:39:07,596
CLEAR YOUR MIND.
ELIMINATE THE PAST.

468
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:10,198
STRONG EMOTIONS
WILL COMPROMISE
THE SOLUTION.

469
00:39:10,232 --> 00:39:13,368
AND I'LL ACCEPT
NO COMPROMISES.

470
00:39:19,374 --> 00:39:21,176
( gasps )

471
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:28,150
Crowley:
CONCUSSION GRENADES,
30-METER RANGE.

472
00:39:28,183 --> 00:39:31,987
TELESCOPING STAFF
WITH TITANIUM CARBIDE
ROTATING BLADES.

473
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,388
IT WILL CUT THROUGH
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.

474
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,859
A HIGHLY COMPACT
ASSAULT WEAPON.

475
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:39,628
THE SIGNATURE GRIP
IS BASED

476
00:39:39,661 --> 00:39:41,329
ON THE SPECIFIC HEAT PATTERN
FROM YOUR HAND.

477
00:39:41,363 --> 00:39:42,964
ANYBODY ELSE
WHO TRIES TO USE IT

478
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:45,934
IS IN FOR
A BIG SURPRISE.

479
00:39:45,967 --> 00:39:48,236
INTEGRAL LASER MOUNT,
400 YARDS.

480
00:39:49,404 --> 00:39:51,206
YEAH, WELL,
DON'T EXPECT PERFECTION

481
00:39:51,239 --> 00:39:53,108
ON THE FIRST
TIME OUT.

482
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:57,012
I WAS TRAINED
IN CLOSE-RANGE TASERS.

483
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:58,446
I EXPECT NOTHING
FROM THE OLD YOU.

484
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,215
I DEMAND PERFECTION
FROM WHAT YOU'VE BECOME.

485
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,892
( music playing )

486
00:40:10,926 --> 00:40:12,627
LET'S MOVE
THE TARGET BACK.

487
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:15,964
THE PROCESS HAS MUCH
IN COMMON WITH DIALYSIS.

488
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:17,632
A SERIES OF NEEDLES
PENETRATE MAJOR ARTERIES.

489
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,001
BLOOD IS FLUSHED FROM
HER BODY AND REPLACED DAILY

490
00:40:20,035 --> 00:40:21,937
WITH A SYNTHETIC SOLUTION
OF NANO MACHINES.

491
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:25,407
THIS SOLUTION RAPIDLY
REGENERATES DAMAGED CELLS

492
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,944
OR, WHEN SUFFUSED
WITH UNFILTERED BLOOD,
RAPIDLY DESTROYS THEM.

493
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:30,612
I'M IMPRESSED, JACK.

494
00:40:30,645 --> 00:40:33,048
IT'S GOT MEDIA SAVVY.

495
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,583
I THINK SHE'S
GOT THIS KIND OF

496
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:38,019
JOAN OF ARC THING.
SHE'S REALLY--

497
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:39,354
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?
- ( moaning )

498
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:44,159
UH, I THINK IT
MUST BE SOME SORT OF--

499
00:40:46,494 --> 00:40:49,998
NEUROCOGNITIVE RESIDUE.

500
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,300
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

501

( piano playing )

505
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:04,072
NO, I'M NOT GETTING BACK
IN THAT THING.

506
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,507
YOU HAVE TO.

507
00:42:08,143 --> 00:42:10,412
WHAT, BECAUSE
OF MY CONTRACT?

508
00:42:11,479 --> 00:42:13,014
SUE ME.

509
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:18,053
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME
TRYING TO SQUEEZE MONEY
OUT OF A CORPSE.

510
00:42:18,086 --> 00:42:19,654
MISS LLOYD,

511
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:23,425
THE NANO CELLS
HAVE A FINITE LIFE SPAN.

512
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:25,560
WITHOUT A DAILY
TRANSFUSION IN THE CHAIR,

513
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:29,064
MASSIVE ORGANIC DEGENERATION
WILL TAKE PLACE.
YOU'LL ROT.

514
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:32,534
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S MY CHOICE TO MAKE.

515
00:42:34,235 --> 00:42:37,405
YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE? YES.
YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE.

516
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:40,442
A CHOICE SERGEANT DUPRE
UNFORTUNATELY CAN NO LONGER
MAKE FOR HIMSELF,

517
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:43,078
THANKS TO MAD DOG
AND HIS COMPANIONS.

518
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:49,517

519
00:42:49,551 --> 00:42:51,419
CAN I EXPECT
YOUR COOPERATION?

520
00:42:59,194 --> 00:43:01,129
( machine beeping )

521
00:43:20,582 --> 00:43:22,584
( piano playing )

522
00:43:51,813 --> 00:43:54,149
-Subject Alyssa Lloyd.

Deceased.

527
00:44:13,501 --> 00:44:15,236
Deceased.

528
00:44:27,816 --> 00:44:30,118
( keypad beeping )

529
00:44:33,822 --> 00:44:35,824
YOU WALKED OUT ON
AN EXPLOSIVES TRAINING
THIS AFTERNOON.

530
00:44:35,857 --> 00:44:37,392
I'D LIKE
AN EXPLANATION.

531
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:45,467
I WONDER IF ANYBODY
PUT WHITE ROSES
ON MY GRAVE.

532
00:44:48,736 --> 00:44:50,705
I LOVE WHITE ROSES.

533
00:44:55,877 --> 00:44:57,745
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

534
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,548
IS THAT IN YOUR FILE?

535
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:15,663
DAN LOVED MY LIPS.

536
00:45:19,534 --> 00:45:20,835
I WONDER
IF HE WOULD NOW.

537
00:45:30,678 --> 00:45:33,948
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE
TO KISS SOMETHING
THAT'S DEAD?

538
00:45:39,754 --> 00:45:41,756
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

539
00:45:41,789 --> 00:45:44,225
YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE UP
YOUR TRAINING TOMORROW.

540
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,798
( crying )

541
00:45:54,035 --> 00:45:56,237
( clanging )

542
00:46:11,386 --> 00:46:13,388
( gasping )

543
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:19,594

544
00:46:29,771 --> 00:46:31,773
( groans )

545
00:46:56,965 --> 00:46:58,967
( keypad beeping )

546
00:47:19,821 --> 00:47:21,823
( machine beeping )

547
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:50,685
IT'S OKAY, BABY.

548
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:53,054
THIS IS ALL OVER
FOR BOTH OF US.

549
00:48:01,696 --> 00:48:04,532
( flatlining )

550
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:36,064
- Lloyd's voice:
WE HAVE YOU COLD! 
- Mad Dog's voice:
SAVE IT!

551
00:48:36,097 --> 00:48:38,166
Dupre's voice:
ALYSSA, WAIT FOR BACKUP!

552
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:41,002
Mad Dog's voice:
I'M GONNA ENJOY
BREAKING YOU IN.

553
00:48:41,035 --> 00:48:42,704
Lloyd's voice:
GO FUCK YOURSELF!

554
00:48:42,737 --> 00:48:43,705
Crowley's voice:
I CAN OFFER YOU
A SECOND CHANCE. 

555
00:48:43,738 --> 00:48:46,641
DO YOU WANT THAT CHANCE?

556
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,643
DO YOU WANT IT?!

557
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:52,013
Mad Dog's voice:
WHAT A SORRY BUNCH
OF DRUG ADDICTS,

558
00:48:52,046 --> 00:48:54,615
DEGENERATES, AND WHORES.

559
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:56,551
Crowley's voice:
SERGEANT DUPRE IS
AT CITY GENERAL.

560
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:58,686
HE'S VEGETATIVE.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

561
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:01,556
- Mad Dog's voice:
IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK! 
-
( gang cheers )

562
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:02,857
Crowley's voice:
WITHOUT A DAILY TRANSFUSION
IN THE CHAIR,

563
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:06,461
MASSIVE ORGANIC DEGENERATION
WILL TAKE PLACE. YOU WILL ROT.

564
00:49:06,494 --> 00:49:08,863
Mad Dog's voice: 
IF GOD IS LISTENING TO YOU,

565
00:49:08,896 --> 00:49:12,166
WELL, THEN, CLICK.

566
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,803
IF HE'S LISTENING
TO YOUR FRIEND OVER HERE...

567
00:49:15,837 --> 00:49:18,039
- BAM!
- ( Lloyd screams )

568
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:20,908
Lloyd's voice: 
IF I CAN ISOLATE MAD DOG,

569
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:22,944
I'M TAKING HIM OUT.
TAKING HIM OUT.

570
00:49:25,246 --> 00:49:27,815
WHO WAS WATCHING
THE MONITOR WHEN
SHE WALKED OUT OF HERE?!

571
00:49:27,849 --> 00:49:31,052
AS A PRECAUTION FOR THIS,
WE HAD HEAT SENSORS,
WE HAD ALARMS.

572
00:49:31,085 --> 00:49:33,020
- YOU WERE CAUGHT
  COMPLETELY UNPREPARED.
-( door opens )

573
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,693
HELP ME.

574
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:41,095
- NO.
- ( gasping )

575
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:47,135
I'M DYING!
HELP ME!

576
00:49:47,168 --> 00:49:50,071
WHY? YOU HAVE
NO ONE TO LIVE FOR.
WHAT'S THE USE?

577
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,842
MAD DOG.

578
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:02,583
I WANT MAD DOG!

579
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:05,086
IN YOUR CURRENT STATE,
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT IT,
MISS LLOYD.

580
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,992
PUT ME IN
THAT CHAIR NOW!

581
00:50:13,294 --> 00:50:15,863
YOU NEED ME.

582
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:20,835
- GO.

583
00:50:28,176 --> 00:50:30,011
Crowley:
HOOK HER UP!

584
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,806
YOUR SUIT AND BODY ARMOR
HAVE BEEN REINFORCED

585
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:00,808
WITH BULLETPROOF
AND FIREPROOF KEVLAR.

586
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,726
THE BUILT-IN TRANSMITTER
INSIDE YOUR MASK

587
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:22,296
ALLOWS FOR TWO-WAY
COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR CUSTOMIZED CYCLE,

588
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,066
WHICH HAS AN 11.2-SECOND
RESPONSE PER QUARTER MILE.

589
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:31,873
IT TOO IS BULLETPROOF,
NATURALLY, WITH AN ONLINE
COMPUTER BUILT INTO THE DASH.

590
00:51:31,906 --> 00:51:34,742
IT'S BEEN CALIBRATED TO FIT
YOUR BODY MASS WITHIN A
THREE-POUND VARIABLE.

591
00:51:34,775 --> 00:51:36,611
SO WATCH YOUR WEIGHT.

592
00:51:36,644 --> 00:51:40,147
THERE'S BEEN A SERIES
OF HIJACKINGS AT METRO HARBOR.

593
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:42,850
WORD IS MAD DOG'S STOCKPILING
MERCHANDISE FOR CASH.

594
00:51:42,884 --> 00:51:44,652
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

595
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:47,221
USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE
IS AT YOUR DISCRETION.

596
00:51:49,824 --> 00:51:52,093
Boxer:
I SAID SHUT UP!

597
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,961
HURRY UP!

598
00:51:53,995 --> 00:51:57,231
SHUT UP!
HURRY UP!

599
00:51:57,265 --> 00:52:00,601
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?
A UNION JOB?

600
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,873
DON'T SAY A WORD.

601
00:52:05,907 --> 00:52:08,843
DON'T EVEN
CRY OUT IN PAIN.

602
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:10,811
- ( groans )
- ( laughing )

603
00:52:10,845 --> 00:52:13,848
( motorcycle revving )

604
00:52:13,881 --> 00:52:15,816
I BET YOU AIN'T
NEVER SEEN ONE OF THESE

605
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,785
IN A LONG TIME, HUH?

606
00:52:17,818 --> 00:52:20,688
I BET YOU WISH
YOU HAD ONE OF THESE

607
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,157
INSTEAD OF THAT
SORRY-ASS CATTLE PROD.

608
00:52:24,692 --> 00:52:26,227
( laughing )

609
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:31,399
THAT'S COMING OUT
OF YOUR ASSES!

610
00:52:31,432 --> 00:52:34,068
NOW PICK IT UP,
YOU UGLY FUCKS!

611
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:37,104
OR I'LL PUT SOME
REAL LEAD IN YOUR ASSES!
( laughs )

612
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,274
( music playing )

613
00:52:40,308 --> 00:52:42,910
WHAT?
( screams )

614
00:52:44,979 --> 00:52:46,147
HOLY SHIT!

615
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:53,955
( groans )

616
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,210
( groans )

617
00:53:20,247 --> 00:53:21,983
( blades whirring )

618
00:53:22,016 --> 00:53:23,951
WHAT THE FUCK?

619
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,061
FUCK!

620
00:53:53,047 --> 00:53:54,949
YES!

621
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:57,251
THIS MUST BE MY LUCKY DAY!

622
00:53:58,219 --> 00:53:59,920
( beeping )

623
00:54:17,271 --> 00:54:18,773
Computer voice:
Excess body mass.

625
00:54:21,976 --> 00:54:24,879

626

Boxer:
WHAT THE FUCK?
WHO'S DENIED?

627
00:54:26,914 --> 00:54:28,315
( brakes screech )

628
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:31,419
WHOA! SHIT!
DAMN! SHIT!

629
00:54:35,322 --> 00:54:36,991
WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOXER?

630
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,860
NEVER SEEN A BALLERINA
WITH BALLS BEFORE?

631
00:54:45,099 --> 00:54:47,201
OH, NOW,
WAIT A MINUTE.

632
00:54:48,335 --> 00:54:51,105
IT CAN'T BE YOU
'CAUSE YOU WAS DEAD.

633
00:54:51,138 --> 00:54:53,007
WHO WAS DEAD?

634
00:54:54,475 --> 00:54:56,977
OH, LORDSY,
LORDSY NOW, LADY.

635
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:00,815
YOU WOULDN'T KILL
A BOXER, WOULD YA?

636
00:55:02,917 --> 00:55:04,952
IN A HEARTBEAT.

637
00:55:08,456 --> 00:55:10,458
( music playing )

638
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,957
CONGRATULATIONS.

639
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:46,427
YOUR APPROVAL RATINGS
HAVE RISEN CONSIDERABLY.

640
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:49,964
I SIMPLY RESPONDED
TO THE VOTERS' NEEDS.

641
00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:53,934
DEMOLITIONIST IS
THE PEOPLE'S WEAPON.

642
00:55:53,968 --> 00:55:55,803
WELL PUT,
YOUR HONOR.

643
00:55:56,871 --> 00:55:58,606
ARE YOU READY
FOR YOUR PRESS DENIAL?

644
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:01,308
OH, CHRIST.
BRING 'EM IN.

645
00:56:03,377 --> 00:56:05,880
Reporter:
HERE WE GO.
LET'S SET UP ON THIS SIDE.

646
00:56:07,348 --> 00:56:09,517
Reporter #2:
MADAM MAYOR, CAN I HAVE
THE FIRST QUESTION?

647
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,818
Reporter:
A CLEARER SHOT HERE.

648
00:56:10,851 --> 00:56:14,955
MADAM MAYOR,
SINCE THE APPEARANCE
OF THIS MYSTERIOUS PHANTOM

649
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:17,358
IN METRO CITY, CRIME HAS
BEEN ON A STEADY DECLINE.

650
00:56:17,391 --> 00:56:20,261
COINCIDENTALLY,
YOUR APPROVAL RATING
HAS SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF.

651
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:23,330
- CARE TO COMMENT?
- OH, I'VE NEVER
  GIVEN TOO MUCH

652
00:56:23,364 --> 00:56:25,533
CREDENCE TO THE POLLS,
MISS CARRUTHERS.

653
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:28,969
ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT
MY CURRENT POSITION IS
RATHER FLATTERING.

654
00:56:29,003 --> 00:56:30,404
( laughing )

655
00:56:30,437 --> 00:56:33,274
CRIME IS DOWN.
GUN RUNNING IS AT
A TWO-YEAR LOW,

656
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,277
AS I PREDICTED
AND PROMISED. SO THERE.

657
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:40,247
NOW YOU GOT SOME GOOD NEWS
TO REPORT, MISS CARRUTHERS.
FOR A CHANGE.

658
00:56:40,281 --> 00:56:43,150
I'LL SANDWICH IT IN
BETWEEN MY COVERAGE
ON THE MAYORAL RACE

659
00:56:43,184 --> 00:56:45,486
AND THE QUESTION
THAT'S ON ALL OUR MINDS,
YOUR HONOR.

660
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:46,887
WHICH IS?

661
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:49,623
WHO IS SHE?
SHE'S NOT REGULAR POLICE.

662
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,659
WHO IS
THE DEMOLITIONIST?

663
00:56:51,692 --> 00:56:54,028
THAT'S AN
INTRIGUING QUESTION.

664
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:55,896
AND THE ANSWER,

665
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:58,566
AS FAR AS THE GOOD PEOPLE
OF METRO CITY ARE CONCERNED,

666
00:56:58,599 --> 00:57:00,901
IS THAT
IT'S COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT.

667
00:57:00,935 --> 00:57:04,171
GOT TO EXCUSE ME,
I'VE GOT A CITY TO RUN.

668
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:05,606
Reporter:
MADAM MAYOR,
ONE MORE QUESTION.

669
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,642
SO THE QUESTION REMAINS.

670
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:10,911
WHO IS THE WOMAN
BEHIND THE MASK

671
00:57:10,945 --> 00:57:13,047
OF METRO CITY'S
CRIME-FIGHTING PHANTOM?

672
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,382
WHO IS THE DEMOLITIONIST?

673
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:18,352
VIEWERS ARE ENCOURAGED
TO DIAL IN THEIR
SUGGESTIONS AT

674
00:57:18,385 --> 00:57:21,889
1-900-555-DEMO.

675
00:57:22,957 --> 00:57:24,925
AM I, LIKE, REALLY SHINY?

676
00:57:35,002 --> 00:57:38,205
( sighs, urinating )

677
00:57:41,642 --> 00:57:43,244
( door closes )

678
00:57:52,753 --> 00:57:54,588
YOU CALL THAT A DICK?

679
00:57:54,622 --> 00:57:56,323
IT LOOKS LIKE ONE,
ONLY SMALLER.

680
00:57:56,357 --> 00:57:58,659
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

681
00:57:58,692 --> 00:58:00,694
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

682
00:58:03,497 --> 00:58:05,332
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

683
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:10,738
WHO OR WHAT

684
00:58:10,771 --> 00:58:12,606
IS THAT PSYCHO BITCH
IN THE OUTFIT?

685
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,042
SHE'S BEEN KNOCKING OFF
MY BOYS LEFT AND RIGHT.

686
00:58:15,676 --> 00:58:17,511
WHAT?
THE DEMOLITIONIST?

687
00:58:17,544 --> 00:58:20,014
IT'S A GODDAMN
PUBLICITY STUNT.

688
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:22,182
GRIMBAUM'S TICKET
TO RE-ELECTION.

689
00:58:22,216 --> 00:58:25,419
WELL, SHE'S ONE
GODDAMN DETERMINED
PUBLICITY STUNT.

690
00:58:25,452 --> 00:58:28,022
PULL THE PLUG ON HER,
YOU HEAR ME?

691
00:58:28,055 --> 00:58:30,357
NOW! NOW!

692
00:58:32,226 --> 00:58:34,028
SORRY.

693
00:58:34,061 --> 00:58:36,430
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE THE MUSCLE.

694
00:58:36,463 --> 00:58:40,000
NOW IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT,
I'LL TAKE MY BUSINESS
TO SOMEBODY WHO CAN.

695
00:58:40,034 --> 00:58:43,237
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T HAVE
AN EXCLUSIVITY CLAUSE,
YOU KNOW.

696
00:58:44,538 --> 00:58:45,673
YEAH, WE DO.

697
00:58:49,176 --> 00:58:50,511
HERE IT IS.

698
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:56,283
YOU SCREW ME, HIGGS,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

699
00:58:57,651 --> 00:58:59,553
AND THIS WILL BE
THE LAST TIME

700
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,221
YOU PISS STANDING UP,
GOT IT?

701
00:59:01,255 --> 00:59:02,656
YEAH.

702
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:04,692
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

703
00:59:04,725 --> 00:59:07,695
NOW YOU GET ME
THOSE FUCKING GUNS...

704
00:59:09,363 --> 00:59:11,432
AND I'LL TAKE
CARE OF IT. OKAY?

705
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,467
( zipper zips )

706
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,036
GIVE ME
THE FUCKIN' MONEY

707
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:18,072
AND YOU'LL GET
THE FUCKIN' GUNS.

708
00:59:28,682 --> 00:59:31,051
LEAVE ME ALONE.
STOP.

709
00:59:31,085 --> 00:59:32,720
LET GO OF ME.
STOP.

710
00:59:32,753 --> 00:59:34,655
LET GO OF ME.

711
00:59:34,688 --> 00:59:36,190
STOP, STOP!

712
00:59:36,223 --> 00:59:38,459
HELP! HELP!

713
00:59:38,492 --> 00:59:40,527
LET GO OF ME!

714
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:44,198
LEAVE ME ALONE! NO! LET GO!

715
00:59:44,231 --> 00:59:46,700
( crying, screaming )

716
00:59:55,743 --> 00:59:58,312
( groans )

717
01:00:18,565 --> 01:00:20,567
( sirens blaring )

718
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:28,742
Lloyd's voice:
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

719
01:00:28,776 --> 01:00:30,310
YOU LIKE THE LEATHER
FOR THE WEDDING,

720
01:00:30,344 --> 01:00:31,779
OR YOU INTO
THE TRADITIONAL WHITE?

721
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:38,852
( alarm sounding )

722
01:00:41,922 --> 01:00:44,124
( music playing )

723
01:00:55,302 --> 01:00:57,171
( door opens )

724
01:01:10,451 --> 01:01:12,186
WHAT'S ALL THIS?

725
01:01:12,219 --> 01:01:14,288
I THOUGHT
WE'D CELEBRATE.

726
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,697
I GUESS YOUR
CREATION IS THE REAL
TALK OF THE TOWN, HUH?

727
01:01:31,638 --> 01:01:33,407
WHAT IS IT?
NON-ALCOHOLIC?

728
01:01:35,676 --> 01:01:37,711
YOU KNOW ALCOHOL
DOESN'T MIX WELL WITH BLOOD.

729
01:01:55,829 --> 01:01:57,764
WHAT? THESE ROSES
AREN'T EVEN REAL?

730
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:02,503
SO IT NEVER DIES.

731
01:02:14,848 --> 01:02:16,517
OPEN IT.
IT'S FOR YOU.

732
01:02:27,895 --> 01:02:29,329
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

733
01:02:30,631 --> 01:02:33,567
RARE.
SYMBOL OF OSIRIS.

734
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:36,904
OSIRIS?

735
01:02:38,572 --> 01:02:40,440
EGYPTIAN GOD
OF THE DEAD.

736
01:02:50,784 --> 01:02:54,655
CONTROL YOUR EMOTIONS
OR YOU'LL COMPROMISE
THE SOLUTION.

737
01:02:55,656 --> 01:02:58,792
I CAN'T CONTROL
MY EMOTIONS!

738
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:00,827
I DON'T WANT
TO CONTROL THEM!

739
01:03:00,861 --> 01:03:02,796
GOD, DON'T YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT THE DAY

740
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:06,833
THAT I'M ABLE TO
CONTROL HOW I FEEL,
THEN I'M REALLY DEAD?!

741
01:03:07,935 --> 01:03:10,370
KIND OF LIKE
HOW YOU ARE NOW!

742
01:03:23,383 --> 01:03:25,686
EGYPTIANS WORSHIP
THE DEAD.

743
01:03:36,096 --> 01:03:37,965
P.A.:
Ho, ho, ho.

744
01:03:37,998 --> 01:03:40,367
A Christmas reminder
to all of our customers.

745
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:43,537
It's never too early
to start thinking about
the holidays.

746
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:46,073
With that in mind,
Metro City Bank is offering

747
01:03:46,106 --> 01:03:48,475
a one-time Christmas bonus.

748
01:03:48,508 --> 01:03:50,611
Customers opening
a holiday account

749
01:03:50,644 --> 01:03:52,980
on Friday will
receive a toaster.

750
01:03:53,013 --> 01:03:55,749
- MOM.
- STOP IT.

751
01:03:55,782 --> 01:03:57,951
...bagels and all your
holiday toasting needs.

752
01:03:57,985 --> 01:04:01,922
Just our way of saying
thank you for using
Metro City Bank.

753
01:04:03,056 --> 01:04:05,058
( music playing )

754
01:04:06,893 --> 01:04:08,862
- ( gunshots ) 
- ( crowd screaming )

755
01:04:12,566 --> 01:04:15,669
WHO DO I SPEAK TO
ABOUT MAKING A LARGE
CASH WITHDRAWAL?

756
01:04:15,702 --> 01:04:17,070
I HOPE IT'S
NOT THIS MAN.

757
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,316
( tires screeching )

758
01:04:35,489 --> 01:04:38,492
Computer voice:
211 in progress--
Metro City Bank.

759
01:04:38,525 --> 01:04:40,027
( beeping )

760
01:04:57,544 --> 01:05:01,415
Higgins:
STAY DOWN. DO NOT
GO IN UNTIL I GIVE THE ORDER.

761
01:05:01,448 --> 01:05:04,051
- DO YOU COPY?
-
( dispatch chatter )

762
01:05:15,796 --> 01:05:17,431
WE WON'T NEED YOUR
HELP ON THIS ONE.

763
01:05:17,464 --> 01:05:19,399
WE'VE GOT THE SITUATION
UNDER CONTROL.

764
01:05:19,433 --> 01:05:22,469
UNDER CONTROL?
A BANK FULL OF HOSTAGES?

765
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:24,504
THERE ARE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN IN THERE.

766
01:05:24,538 --> 01:05:27,741
AND I WON'T
ALLOW A BLOOD-BATH,
NOT ON MY WATCH.

767
01:05:27,774 --> 01:05:29,643
WE'RE NEGOTIATING
WITH THEM.

768
01:05:29,676 --> 01:05:31,878
YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE
WITH ANIMALS.

769
01:05:31,912 --> 01:05:33,780
I'M ORDERING
YOU TO STAND DOWN.

770
01:05:33,814 --> 01:05:36,016
YEAH, WELL,
I DON'T TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU.

771
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:39,786
FINE.
DO IT YOUR WAY.

772
01:05:41,488 --> 01:05:43,957
- HOW MANY ARE IN THERE?
- FIVE, MAYBE SIX...

773
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:46,760
INCLUDING MAD DOG.

774
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:51,064
YEAH.

775
01:05:52,566 --> 01:05:54,468
COME ON! MOVE IT!

776
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:55,936
PUT THE MONEY
IN THE BAG!

777
01:05:55,969 --> 01:05:59,639
COME ON! PUT SOME COINAGE
IN THERE, TOO, ALL RIGHT?

778
01:05:59,673 --> 01:06:01,875
I GOT TO DO
SOME LAUNDRY.

779
01:06:01,908 --> 01:06:04,478
- OH, SHIT! 
-
( motorcycle engine roars )

780
01:06:39,813 --> 01:06:41,014
WE'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

781
01:06:41,047 --> 01:06:43,216
I DON'T THINK SO.

782
01:06:50,590 --> 01:06:52,125
YOU'RE KILLING HER.

783
01:06:58,532 --> 01:07:00,500
HERE. HERE,
TURN AROUND, HONEY.

784
01:07:00,534 --> 01:07:03,937
IT'S OKAY.
THE BIG BAD
BITCH IN BLACK

785
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:07,974
DOESN'T WANT
TO HURT US,
DOES SHE?

786
01:07:16,082 --> 01:07:18,084
( beeping )

787
01:07:41,007 --> 01:07:42,943
( beeping )

788
01:07:56,857 --> 01:07:57,991
( screams )

789
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:08,902
( explosion )

790
01:08:10,871 --> 01:08:13,039
Higgins:
YOU'RE SURE SHE'S OKAY?

791
01:08:13,073 --> 01:08:16,977
BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE
A DOCTOR LOOK AT HER
IF YOU'D LIKE. ALL RIGHT?

792
01:08:20,881 --> 01:08:22,949
( sirens blaring )

793
01:08:28,955 --> 01:08:31,658
-DAWSON, GET A MEDIC ON THIS. 
-( radio chatter )

794
01:08:33,927 --> 01:08:35,929
-
( door opens, closes ) 
- ( whistling )

795
01:08:58,251 --> 01:09:00,620
GOOD WORK, PROFESSOR.

796
01:09:03,957 --> 01:09:05,959
CREATED QUITE A MONSTER.

797
01:09:05,992 --> 01:09:07,160
YOU'RE OVER-REACTING.

798
01:09:07,193 --> 01:09:09,930
NO. I LEFT
A LITTLE GIRL TO DIE

799
01:09:09,963 --> 01:09:12,299
BECAUSE I WANTED
MAD DOG.

800
01:09:12,332 --> 01:09:14,801
OKAY, I MEAN,
I DIDN'T EVEN THINK
TWICE ABOUT IT.

801
01:09:14,834 --> 01:09:17,237
YOU KNOW, I JUST DID
WHAT I WAS CREATED TO DO.

802
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:27,247
I MEAN, I DON'T--
I DON'T EVEN THINK OR FEEL

803
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,884
LIKE A HUMAN BEING
AT ALL ANYMORE.

804
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:34,287
I'M JUST-- I'M JUST, LIKE,
SOME WEIRD KILLING MACHINE.

805
01:09:36,723 --> 01:09:38,258
AND YOU BLAME ME?

806
01:09:41,728 --> 01:09:43,930
MISS LLOYD,

807
01:09:43,964 --> 01:09:46,099
YOUR PASSION FOR VENGEANCE
HAS SHAPED WHAT YOU'VE BECOME

808
01:09:46,132 --> 01:09:48,735
MUCH MORE THAN
LAZARUS EVER DID.

809
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:51,438
AND WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

810
01:09:51,471 --> 01:09:54,441
YOU OBVIOUSLY
HARBOR EMOTIONS

811
01:09:54,474 --> 01:09:56,176
FROM YOUR
PREVIOUS LIFE.

812
01:09:56,209 --> 01:09:58,979
FROM THAT NIGHT MAD DOG
HAD YOUR LOVER KILLED.

813
01:09:59,012 --> 01:10:01,281
MY CONTRIBUTION
TO YOUR PSYCHE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT

814
01:10:01,314 --> 01:10:03,350
OR THAT UNFORTUNATE
BUSINESS WITH THE CHILD.

815
01:10:03,383 --> 01:10:05,952
THE CHOICES YOU MAKE ABOUT
WHO YOU ARE NOW ARE YOURS.

816
01:10:05,986 --> 01:10:08,054
AND YOURS ALONE.

817
01:10:16,963 --> 01:10:18,932
EXCELLENT CHOICE.

818
01:10:25,939 --> 01:10:27,941
( music playing )

819
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:32,278
( door opens, closes )

820
01:10:41,921 --> 01:10:44,958
Higgins:
I AM HOLDING.
I HAVE BEEN HOLDING.

821
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:50,263
HIGGINS!

822
01:10:50,296 --> 01:10:53,066
WELL, HOW LONG DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO WAIT?

823
01:10:53,099 --> 01:10:56,903
YEAH, GET ME
CHRISTY CARRUTHERS, PLEASE.

824
01:10:56,936 --> 01:11:00,940
I HAVE SOMETHING
SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.

825
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:07,047
Has The Demolitionist,
Metro City's guardian angel

826
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:08,448
lost her wings?

827
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:11,818
Inside source has obtained
exclusive, shocking footage

828
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,320
that proved
the crime buster's heart

829
01:11:14,354 --> 01:11:17,857
may be as black
as her wardrobe.

830
01:11:17,891 --> 01:11:20,927
Luckily, Metro Police were
able to extract the grenades

831
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,530
from the crying child
and detonate them safely.

832
01:11:23,563 --> 01:11:26,266
An inside source
at the mayor's office re--

833
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:29,903
HOW UNFORTUNATE.

834
01:11:29,936 --> 01:11:32,505
THAT SHOT WILL MAKE
THE COVER OF EVERY PAPER
IN THE STATE.

835
01:11:32,539 --> 01:11:35,542
CONGRATULATIONS,
JACK.

836
01:11:35,575 --> 01:11:37,844
WHAT DO WE GET
FOR AN ENCORE?

837
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:40,513
I'M SURE IT WAS A BIT
OF A POLITICAL SETBACK.

838
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:46,019
YOU CALL LEAVING
AN INNOCENT CHILD
TO DIE A SETBACK?

839
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:48,922
REGISTERED VOTERS
HATE THAT CRAP!

840
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,826
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

841
01:11:52,859 --> 01:11:54,461
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

842
01:11:54,494 --> 01:11:56,863
I'M CUTTIN'
MY LOSSES RIGHT HERE.

843
01:11:56,896 --> 01:12:00,100
SHE'S OFF THE STREETS.
I'VE GIVEN ORDERS
TO SEE TO IT.

844
01:12:00,133 --> 01:12:03,870
IT'S A MATTER OF,
HOW DID YOU SAY IT?
SELF-PRESERVATION.

845
01:12:05,138 --> 01:12:08,141
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- NAW, STOP BLEEDING, JACK.

846
01:12:08,174 --> 01:12:09,476
LAZARUS IS FINISHED.

847
01:12:09,509 --> 01:12:11,811
IL FAIT ACCOMPLI.

848
01:12:11,845 --> 01:12:15,115
ALYSSA LLOYD SAVED YOUR LIFE
AND YOUR CAREER, MAYOR.

849
01:12:15,148 --> 01:12:17,817
YOU PULL THE PLUG ON LAZARUS,
IT'S JUST LIKE MURDERING HER.

850
01:12:17,851 --> 01:12:21,788
NO, IT ISN'T, JACK.
SHE'S ALREADY DEAD.

851
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:30,897
( music playing )

852
01:12:35,902 --> 01:12:37,003
Officers need assistance.

853
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:39,906
Parking structure,
corner of Roosevelt and Fifth.

854
01:12:42,642 --> 01:12:44,344
( tires screeching )

855
01:13:03,997 --> 01:13:05,298
GREAT RESPONSE TIME.

856
01:13:05,331 --> 01:13:08,268
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT
EATING DONUTS SOMEWHERE?

857
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:10,170
SHOULDN'T YOU
BE DEAD?

858
01:13:14,007 --> 01:13:15,975
