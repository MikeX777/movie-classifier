1
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,890
You Mo's daughter?

2
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,725
Yeah.

3
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
Okay. Well, I'm the housekeeper.
I'm here to pick you up.

4
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,647
What happened to 9 o'clock?

5
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,016
So, anyway, as I said, I'm Joel.

6
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,811
I'm your mom's housekeeper.

7
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,611
So, we'll probably be seeing a lot of
each other.

8
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:43,121
You excited to be moving back in with her?

9
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,665
She hasn't seen you in a while.

10
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,209
What's it been? Three or four years?

11
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,795
She's excited to see you.

12
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,049
Yeah...

13
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,472
It'll be a nice change-up from the two of
us.

14
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,641
It's just usually us.

15
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,728
I help her get the mail. Cook, clean...

16
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,896
feed the cat.

17
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,066
Sometimes we do fun stuff , like , go to
a movie or something.

18
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,110
Just to change it all up.

19
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,948
But, yeah, three people will be nice in
that apartment.

20
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:28,249
I'll bet you'll love the view. It's on
the twelfth floor, at the very top.

21
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,795
You can see for miles from that window.
All the way out to the parks.

22
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:37,425
You know, they say, when Mo gets on the
elevator, and she pushes the twelfth
floor button,

23
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:43,806
they say, "Oh, she's going to the
penthouse. Mo's going up to the
penthouse!"

24
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,855
So, what does "A" stand for, anyway?

25
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,692
Abigail?

26
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,111
Annabel?

27
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,657
Alice?

28
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,326
Not Alice.

29
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,455
Anna! Anna's a nice name.

30
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:11,542
Yeah, Mo wouldn't give you a bad name.

31
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,254
Do you ever shut up?

32
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,885
Okay.

33
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:35,024
I'll just say one more thing, okay?

34
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,069
She is thrilled to see you.

35
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,825
She's glad you're coming home.

36
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,493
I don't see how,

37
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,789
because you seem like the perfect doting
child.

38
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,583
Why should she need me?!

39
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,983
Well, here we are.

40
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,153
Home sweet home.

41
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:36,210
Well, it is for some of us, at least.

42
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,383
Need any help?

43
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:24,967
No.

44
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,886
Alright...

45
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:28,846
Do you know the way?

46
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,139
Yes!

47
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,810
Oh, that's good. She knows the way.

48
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,309
Almost beat you up here, huh?

49
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,688
It's not locked. You can go on in.

50
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,189
Here you go.

51
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,944
We're back, Mo.

52
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,946
Oh, great!

53
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,990
Well, hi, A.

54
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,120
How was your trip over?

55
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,456
It was fine.

56
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,333
That's good.

57
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,296
You got everything moved over?

58
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,631
Mmhm.

59
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,592
Well... That's good.

60
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,345
I'm sorry to interrupt. I'm just going to
get the rest of the boxes.

61
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,388
Okay. Great, Joel.

62
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,641
Wow!

63
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,851
All that red hair.

64
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,023
How long have you had it?

65
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,733
Awhile.

66
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,068
You must like it.

67
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:54,695
I do.

68
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:03,621
I'm going to have to get used to that,
but I'm sure I can manage.

69
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,003
You know, Joel's a great cook.

70
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:14,298
He could whip us up something for supper
tonight.

71
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,342
What would you like?

72
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,678
He also talks a lot.

73
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:23,224
Well, so do I. And you used to.

74
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,856
We just want to make you feel welcomed.

75
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,157
Why don't you...

76
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:44,578
take you're coat off? Make yourself feel
at home?

77
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,955
Good morning, A.

78
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,418
Do you like your food?

79
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,676
Joel's a really good cook.

80
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,764
I like it.

81
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:13,892
A?

82
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,562
It's fine.

83
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:24,986
You know,

84
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,948
We really haven't had a chance to talk
much

85
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,283
since you've been back.

86
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,829
I have nothing to talk about.

87
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:42,754
We've not seen each other for three years,
and you don't think there's anything to
talk about?

88
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,846
Do you think you'll like living here?

89
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,768
Wouldn't it be nice if we could,

90
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,521
you know, talk to each other?

91
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:07,320
I don't want to just sit here and stare
at each other night after night.

92
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:11,450
I just want to be left alone!
Some peace and quiet.

93
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,373
Well... That's not going to happen.

94
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,423
Do you feel like you're stuck?

95
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,383
What do you think?!

96
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,803
It doesn't have to be like that.

97
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,184
You can go places.

98
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:41,646
I'm sure Joel would take you somewhere.

99
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,692
You have friends?

100
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,489
They're welcome. They can come over and
take you places.

101
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:57,329
I can't just go out and have fun, like
other people my age!

102
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,622
Why not?

103
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,000
You should know.

104
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:05,295
I have help.

105
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,589
I can go places.

106
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:12,219
Sure beats sitting home alone all the
time.

107
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,722
Yeah, and what have you done with your
life?

108
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,183
I had you.

109
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,393
Well, thanks a fucking lot!

110
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,151
I want us to be close again. We used to.

111
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,322
My mom and I, we were close.

112
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:38,703
I want that for A and I, to be close
again.

113
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:44,000
This is going to be so hard.

114
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:48,797
Joel, do you think I'm doing the right
thing by having her come here?

115
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,006
I do.

116
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,466
I hope so.

117
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:56,555
I mean, I've always believed family helps
family.

118
00:25:57,013 --> 00:26:05,230
Not just throw them out in the street, or
send them to a shelter amongst strangers.

119
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:13,446
We're family, we should be together,
but...

120
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:28,837
She comes over here, after she agreed to
move in with me, and she don't even want
to talk to me!

121
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,883
And when we do, we just have this huge
blow-up, and...

122
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:55,697
Hey.

123
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,244
All unpacked? Settled in?

124
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,331
Yeah.

125
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:09,002
Want me to take those for you?

126
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,463
Sure.

127
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,055
Got a lot of stuff. Lot of boxes.

128
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,479
Hey.

129
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,398
What's in those?

130
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:33,777
Hmm.

131
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:39,908
You know I've worked around them all
the time, and I have no idea.

132
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,786
Probably storage, or something.

133
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:47,040
You're free to look. It's your room, now.

134
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,036
And, good morning, everyone.

135
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,413
Sorry I'm a little late today.

136
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,792
Just had to have my coffee, you know how
that is.

137
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,378
How's everyone doing today?

138
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:47,465
Oh, you're looking a tiny bit droopy.

139
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,593
We might have to give you a little bit of
a cut.

140
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,887
But, it won't hurt. Don't worry about it.

141
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,640
I'll be very, very gentle.

142
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,434
It's so good to see everyone.

143
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,647
And, how are we doing with
our new friend, the fern?

144
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,692
Everyone say, "Hi, Fern!"

145
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:12,991
We've never had such a large plant before
but it's very, very nice to have you.

146
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:21,249
Of course, we're sorry about Mrs. Milton,
and that you couldn't be in her apartment
anymore, but she had to move...

147
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,673
Beach music! Our favorite! Come on!

148
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,341
Okay. Here we go!

149
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,637
That's good music.

150
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,849
Oh, it's wonderful music! Reminds me
of the Carolinas.

151
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,727
The Carolinas, huh? Reminds me of Koko
Head.

152
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,020
Oh, I know.

153
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,896
Okay, here we go!

154
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,278
I always want to hug you when we dance.

155
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,446
Well... good!

156
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:53,448
That is good!

157
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:57,702
Alright, ready for a little twirl here...?

158
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,287
Wow.

159
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:07,295
What do we have? It's impossible to walk
by this book without taking a look. I
can't believe it.

160
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:12,383
There's Ike. There's Patton. What are
they talking about?

161
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:19,307
Oh yeah! "The Race for Tunisia"!

162
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:25,438
"Command and Corps in Tunisia: Patton".

163
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:31,903
Who knew I'd be a history buff?
Who knew I would be so
interested in World War II?

164
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,781
But, then... shoot!

165
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:40,411
I got a grandfather who had shrapnel in
his leg from World War I,

166
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:46,375
and my dad flew B-17s over Germany as a
belly-gunner.

167
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,212
A belly-gunner...

168
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,005
Who the hell even reads the newspaper
anymore?

169
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,006
Who ever reads this?!

170
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:55,301
It's your bill! I'm tired of paying your
bills!

171
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,427
What bill?

172
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,099
It's not mine.

173
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,308
It is yours.

174
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:04,352
How could that possibly be mine?

175
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,896
It's from now! I just now got it in the
mail!

176
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,022
What about this?

177
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:09,857
This is all you, too!

178
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,653
That's not me! That's you! That's not me
at all! They're all your bills.

179
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,779
No.

180
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,448
I'd don't use that stuff!

181
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,952
Why do we have to have this conversation
every day? I don't understand!

182
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,329
Because every day you're ringing up bills!

183
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,248
No I'm not. Please.

184
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,417
Hey! Don't you...

185
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,567
What are you doing?

186
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,527
I was just checking it out.

187
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,196
Put it back!

188
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,326
Sorry.

189
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:30,456
Just because you're my Mom's housekeeper
doesn't mean that you can go through my
things!

190
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,458
Won't happen again.

191
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,502
I bet you don't even know what that is.

192
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,879
I bet you ten bucks that I do.

193
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,636
Alright, you're on! What is it?

194
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,597
It's you owing me ten bucks,

195
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,435
because that is a shotgun shell reloader.

196
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,492
How do you know what that is?

197
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,287
Because my grandfather used to own one.

198
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:14,542
You see, during the 1930s, during the
Great Depression.

199
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:20,047
They used to reload their own spent
shotgun shells with their own material
to save money.

200
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,426
So, they didn't have to go buy new ones
at the store.

201
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,178
Sound about right?

202
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,475
Just know not to go through my stuff.

203
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,644
I'll ask next time,

204
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:40,735
but from now on, maybe you can stop
acting like I'm as dumb as I look? Hmm?

205
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,321
You certainly are rude.

206
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,489
How was your day?

207
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,248
It was alright.

208
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,458
What did you do?

209
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:21,877
Not much.

210
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,712
You went out.

211
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,882
You must have done something?

212
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,182
I was just doing a little bit of...

213
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,476
bird watching.

214
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,438
Oh! That's exciting.

215
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,525
What kind of birds did you see?

216
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:47,486
Well...

217
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:55,244
I saw a Bald Eagle perched on a building.

218
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,999
That's neat! Don't see too many of them.

219
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,959
What else?

220
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:07,798
I saw a mother Robin tending her nest.

221
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,179
That's neat. I like Robins.

222
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,772
I saw a couple Sparrows kind of dancing
around each other.

223
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,276
Oh, that would have been fun to have seen!

224
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:35,868
But then, there were some really, really
aggressive Crows.

225
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,622
Yeah, Crows can be like like that, I
guess.

226
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:44,376
I really don't know too much about birds,
but

227
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,961
they're fun to watch.

228
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,214
So, where are we going first?

229
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,341
We're going to the bank.

230
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,384
"To the bank", and then what happens...?

231
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:30,506
Do we go to a show? Do we...

232
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,759
Uh! Help me, here. Help me, here!

233
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,434
Okay, give me your arm.

234
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,815
Sorry.

235
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,498
Well, come on!

236
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,298
Hi, there.

237
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,052
What the hell are you doing here?

238
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:42,596
I work here.

239
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,935
What have you been up to?

240
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,561
Nothing.

241
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,731
Just bird watching.

242
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:56,068
Not a lot of birds out, yet.

243
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,487
You would be surprised.

244
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,910
You would be surprised to know that when
I was taking the trash out a little
earlier,

245
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,789
I looked through one of the windows,
and I saw you down there in the park.

246
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:14,545
Your binoculars were faced towards the
building.

247
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,217
You want to tell me what's up with that?

248
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,013
Fine, you caught me.

249
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,225
I was doing some people watching.

250
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,979
You're spying on the residents.

251
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,316
I really wouldn't call it spying. It's
just more curiosity.

252
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,528
It's a breach of privacy.

253
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,489
Oh, as if they would even know.

254
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,367
What if you get caught?

255
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:46,952
So what?

256
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,330
There would be a lot of trouble.

257
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:55,627
I hate to break it to you, but I'm going
to have to do the five-year-old thing,
and tell on you.

258
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:08,557
You're going to tell on me?

259
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,728
To who? My mom? What's that going to do?

260
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:16,190
Yeah, I'll tell your mom, for a start.

261
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,694
And then, I'm going to tell the building
management, because they'll get a kick
out of it.

262
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:26,450
Fine! What do you want?

263
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,078
Oh, wait. You're going to bribe me now,
is that it?

264
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,290
Bribe me, so you can keep playing this
sick little game?

265
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,292
Call it what you want.

266
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,137
Okay. I've got something.

267
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,182
You can start being nice to Mo.

268
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,311
I mean, she's your mom, for Christ's sake!

269
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,773
And, she saved your ass by letting you
live here,

270
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,484
so I think the least you could do is open
up.

271
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,320
Fine. I'll try.

272
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:06,657
You promise?

273
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,992
I promise I'll try.

274
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,580
Deal?

275
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,126
Deal.

276
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:28,812
Hi.

277
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,021
Hey.

278
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,067
What are you doing?

279
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,236
The floor's uneven.

280
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,363
Have you ever realized that?

281
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,573
Really?

282
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,741
Hmm.

283
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:46,621
Yeah, I was having trouble with my
wheelchair, and I decided to try marbles.

284
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,584
I guess I never would have realized that.

285
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,253
Anyway, I wanted to bring this by.

286
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,463
I thought maybe you'd be interested.

287
00:52:55,589 --> 00:53:00,135
My roommates, they can't stand it anymore.
They think it's...

288
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,430
cursed, or something. It gives them the
creeps.

289
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:08,226
It's a lucky cat statue.

290
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:12,105
The Japanese call it Ma... uh...

291
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,398
Maneki-necko.

292
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:14,524
That's it.

293
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:17,861
Interested in giving it a good home?

294
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:22,782
Sure. I'll take it.

295
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,918
So, still doing any... "bird watching".

296
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:34,586
I am.

297
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,758
Thinking about doing some night watching,
as well.

298
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,304
Okay. Spy at your own peril.

299
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,513
I will.

300
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:48,016
Oh, and....

301
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:56,316
I didn't know if you knew this or not,
but there's a community balcony you're
free to use. All the floors have them.

302
00:53:56,608 --> 00:54:02,280
Might give you a good view, and you
wouldn't have to go into the park at
night.

303
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,201
Okay. Cool.

304
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,036
Thanks.

305
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,120
Sure.

306
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:34,896
Well, you're still here. That's a
surprise.

307
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:41,027
Never been anyone that was still here.

308
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,449
They're here, and then they're not here.

309
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,495
Why would I expect anything different
from you?

310
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:57,544
I shower you. Talk to you. Feed you.

311
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:01,339
And...

312
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,554
what do I get? Nothing. Nothing!

313
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:18,481
You're just... you're only plants.

314
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:25,447
Not just... you're not just plants.

315
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:32,162
You're the only thing that's stayed.
And listened.

316
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,708
You've been a part of me.

317
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:45,467
Everything, everyone goes... away.

318
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,478
Wait a minute! What are you doing?

319
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,979
I don't like your attitude.

320
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,606
Well, tough!

321
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,484
What is the matter with you?

322
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,695
I don't know what's the matter with me!

323
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,991
Alright. I'll try dancing again.

324
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,205
Ow!

325
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,248
You stepped on my foot!

326
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:20,877
I didn't step on your foot! You put your
foot over here, where mine was.

327
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,379
What? That's ridiculous!

328
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,173
I was doing my dance step, and you
screwed it up!

329
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:25,840
Me?

330
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:26,800
Yeah. You!

331
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,426
You're impossible.

332
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,096
Wait a minute! What about supper?!

333
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,806
Never mind supper. Fix your own!

334
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,349
I'll starve!

335
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,357
Remember?

336
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:49,322
You told me about that. I couldn't figure
out what you meant by The Battle of the
Bulge.

337
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:52,158
I later read about it.

338
00:56:53,827 --> 00:57:03,336
Patton, and Montgomery, and Omar Bradley
headed up by a guy from Abilene.

339
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,381
My god.

340
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:25,692
If only I could see the two of you today.
That would be so beautiful.

341
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:29,446
You lived a good life. You were strong.

342
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,908
Lived in a one room house.

343
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:39,706
Twenty-by-twenty. Des Moines, Iowa.

344
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:42,792
All these guys.

345
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:47,547
All this "attack, attack" and "fall back" and...

346
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:55,472
Didn't have to be this way!

347
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,827
I'm done!

348
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,374
That was good.

349
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,085
Thank you.

350
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,220
Time to do the dishes.

351
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,513
Yeah, right.

352
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,272
Time for bed.

353
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:48,358
Come on. I've got you.

354
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:59,744
Hey, old woman. I love you. Thanks for
taking care of me.

355
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,788
Awe, you're a good boy.

356
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,417
Time to go to bed.

357
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,785
Do you know which apartment the EMTs
went to?

358
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:51,874
Yeah. B904. Ninth floor.

359
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:57,714
Isn't that the one with the old lady and
her son, or whoever it is that lives with
her?

360
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,840
Ed?

361
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,633
You know his name?

362
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:06,723
Yes, I know his name. We uh...
I've worked with him a couple times. Okay?

363
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:10,226
Why is it so important to you?

364
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:13,146
Did they say how she died?

365
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:19,193
Yes. They said natural causes. They think
she stopped breathing during the night
sometime,

366
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:22,280
and they found her in bed.

367
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:27,160
I don't think it was natural causes.

368
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:28,619
Oh, really?

369
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,288
Think she was murdered?

370
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:36,419
Yeah, I kind of... do think think she was
murdered.

371
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,047
And, what brings you to that conclusion?

372
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,675
I saw something weird last night. Okay?

373
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:48,973
You saw something weird during that
illegal activity that you call "bird
watching".

374
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,100
That's convincing.

375
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:57,482
I know what I saw, and she suddenly turns
up dead the next day.

376
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,484
A little weird, don't you think?

377
01:02:59,776 --> 01:03:02,028
I think you're making it up.

378
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:19,462
Alright. You've got to stop doing that!

379
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:21,714
Alright, listen. I saw....

380
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:28,513
a lamp fall over. I saw a shadow, or a
silhouette, or...

381
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:30,181
it looked like it was-

382
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:33,476
Okay, look. You think you saw something.

383
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:37,563
Okay, you think you saw a lamp get
knocked over.

384
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:40,358
But, I think you're making it all up.

385
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:44,028
You're making it all up because you're
bored out of your little head.

386
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,575
You've been bored since you got here, so
it makes since to me that you're just
trying to cause a little fuss

387
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,036
for your own entertainment.

388
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,873
So I think you should drop it.

389
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:04,382
I know what I saw, and I know I'm not
lying!

390
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,010
What did you do today?

391
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,596
Not much.

392
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,892
Didn't go bird watching?

393
01:04:16,143 --> 01:04:17,645
Eh, not so much anymore.

394
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:19,188
Why not?

395
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:23,442
There's only so much I can take of
aggressive Crows.

396
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:24,777
Oh.

397
01:04:26,654 --> 01:04:31,284
Because I thought you were enjoying those
dancing Sparrows and that...

398
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:32,910
mother Robin?

399
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:53,097
So...

400
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,226
I know I haven't always been very

401
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,186
appreciative

402
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:03,024
of all that you've done for me.

403
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:07,278
I just want to let you know that I'm
going to try to do better.

404
01:05:07,528 --> 01:05:11,866
I appreciate that. That's good to hear.

405
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:19,081
I know this hasn't been easy for you.

406
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:28,591
I'm sure it's hard, you know, after
living on your own, then having to move
back in with me.

407
01:05:30,718 --> 01:05:35,139
I guess I got so used to being on my own
that...

408
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:42,605
I thought my world was going to crash
and I took everything out on you.

409
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:53,741
I can understand that. I know there's
been times I've been upset at a situation
and have taken it out on others.

410
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:56,410
Doesn't make it right,

411
01:05:58,371 --> 01:05:59,330
but...

412
01:06:02,291 --> 01:06:04,043
I can understand it.

413
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:15,513
I'm just glad that you're willing to want
to have a relationship again.

414
01:06:16,055 --> 01:06:18,516
I'm willing to try harder, too.

415
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:26,607
And, I would very much like for us to...
have a relationship.

416
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:33,447
Find some interests, and be able to do
things together.

417
01:06:34,865 --> 01:06:39,662
That would be fun. Have my daughter back.

418
01:10:34,438 --> 01:10:35,439
Hey, where are you off too?

419
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,565
Ninth floor.

420
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,528
No you're not. No you're not. Get back
here.

421
01:10:41,862 --> 01:10:43,364
Come on! I got to go!

422
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,537
I know what you're up to, and you're not
going down there.

423
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:53,082
You don't know anything, for sure.

424
01:10:53,332 --> 01:10:54,333
And neither do you.

425
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:58,671
That's why you shouldn't go down there
snooping around like this.

426
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:04,426
It's not like I'm going to go up to his
door, and say, "Hi! Are you a murderer?"

427
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,179
That's what it sounds like you're doing.

428
01:11:07,304 --> 01:11:11,475
No. I'm just going to knock on his door
and

429
01:11:12,309 --> 01:11:17,022
chat with him a little bit. Maybe look
around when he's not looking.

430
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:24,154
I just don't think that's a very good
idea.

431
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,867
I'm sure you think a lot of things aren't
a good idea.

432
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:33,998
Well, yeah. I'm the only one who thinks
around here. Wait a second! Wait!

433
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:40,963
Okay. Okay, I think maybe I know where
this is going. Maybe... maybe.

434
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:42,631
Look.

435
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:48,762
If you're trying to do this to prove a
point to me, you don't have to do that,
okay?

436
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:52,099
It has nothing to do with proving a point
to you.

437
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:55,311
I just want justice for the old lady.

438
01:12:00,190 --> 01:12:04,361
Do you think anyone should actually, you
know,

439
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:09,825
have to go through that. And just think,
"Oh, well, she just died in her sleep." ?

440
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:14,830
Would you want justice if it was your
relative?

441
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:24,631
Yes. If you put it that way, yes. And, if
that's what actually happened, yes.

442
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:34,892
And, okay, maybe you actually... I'll
take a leap here. Maybe you actually saw
something, and

443
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:39,563
on that note I'm sorry about the other
day.

444
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,481
Really?

445
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:46,945
Yes. Sincerely, I'm sorry. I... Look,

446
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:50,741
I blew up on you because...

447
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:56,955
It probably sounds stupid, but I've been
working in places like this for a while,
now.

448
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:04,588
And, you get to know older people. You
respect them a lot,

449
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:11,553
and a lot of them are just really
helpless, and you don't like the idea of
people killing them.

450
01:13:12,096 --> 01:13:20,771
It just... it got to me, because I
thought you were making it up. It got to
me. So, I'm sorry.

451
01:13:20,896 --> 01:13:26,318
This is why I need to do something. So
she can have some justice.

452
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:38,288
Okay. Alright, look. If you're so
determined to see this done, then...

453
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,582
then I'll go down there.

454
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,545
So how are you going to get in there?

455
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:53,595
It's not like I can just knock on the
front door and say, "Hi, Ed! Long time,
no see." You know?

456
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:58,225
And then snoop around as he fixes me a
cup of tea. It's not going to work like
that.

457
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:02,062
Yeah, he doesn't really seem like the
friendly type.

458
01:14:02,938 --> 01:14:03,939
No.

459
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:11,488
We're going to have to get in there when
he's not home.

460
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:13,991
You mean, like, break in?

461
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:17,119
Sort of.

462
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,038
You know when I said I worked
with him that one time?

463
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,039
Mmhm.

464
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,126
Well, I was helping him move a bunch of
stuff into storage.

465
01:14:24,418 --> 01:14:26,587
Took a whole freaking month. So, anyway,

466
01:14:26,795 --> 01:14:33,093
I ended up keeping this, because the
whole thing ended on a sour note, and
he never asked for it back.

467
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:38,056
So, I guess you don't need to break in.
You can just walk in through the front
door.

468
01:14:38,223 --> 01:14:39,224
Mmhm.

469
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:45,564
But, when? I mean, he's always there.

470
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,573
I think I have an idea.

471
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,336
I think that's right.

472
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,255
Okay, it's ringing.

473
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,424
No, no, no! You do it.

474
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:14,051
What?! Why?!

475
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:19,306
I don't sound professional over the
phone. I sound like a little girl.

476
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,392
Do it! Do it, do it, do it!
Alright, alright.

477
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:27,481
Yes, good afternoon, Sir. I am with
Denver and Strasbourg.

478
01:15:28,649 --> 01:15:33,445
Yes, the uh, insurance company downtown,
that’s correct.

479
01:15:34,738 --> 01:15:41,245
And I have a policy here that is worth
$50,000

480
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:44,915
in the event of such a death that we
heard occurred in your residence.

481
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:49,378
Oh, it was taken out about 5 years ago,
yes.

482
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,798
That’s right, $50,000.

483
01:15:55,050 --> 01:16:00,264
Well, you see, it has to be, and I’m
sorry, this is rather inconvenient for
you,

484
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:02,975
it has to be claimed today.

485
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:11,942
Yes, it expires in a week, but, you know,
there’s a lot of paperwork to get through.
We have to get the ball rolling.

486
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:19,658
Again, I’m sorry it’s such an
inconvenience, but it is a...

487
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,201
lot of money.

488
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:24,580
Yes.

489
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:30,377
Okay, well, we appreciate your business,
and we look forward to seeing you.

490
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:33,088
Mmhm, buh-bye.

491
01:16:34,798 --> 01:16:35,799
Did he buy it?

492
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:38,051
Yeah, he says he's on his way.

493
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:40,929
Good.

494
01:17:16,673 --> 01:17:20,385
Okay. looks like he's falling for it.

495
01:17:29,936 --> 01:17:33,774
Alright. You need to get down there and
find something.

496
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,277
Something? Like what?

497
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:42,866
Anything that could be used as evidence?
Something that looks out of place?

498
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:46,495
Alright. Easy enough, I guess.

499
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:55,629
How long do you think we should wait? You
know, to make sure he's out of the
building?

500
01:17:56,046 --> 01:18:01,218
I'd say let's give him a bit. About...
ten minutes.

501
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:07,432
Alright. We'll wait it out for ten
minutes, then.

502
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:18,318
Oh, yeah, make sure you have your
walky-talky on at all times.

503
01:18:21,488 --> 01:18:24,116
Keep the volume low, though. We don't
want to attract attention.

504
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,242
Right.

505
01:18:28,412 --> 01:18:30,122
You're my look-out, so

506
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:35,961
you let me know ASAP if anything fishy
goes down so I can get out of there.

507
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:39,131
And don't you dare get caught.

508
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:44,469
And don't get caught. Right.

509
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:10,949
This is nuts!

510
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:42,647
Any of this junk could be evidence. Any
of it could not be evidence!

511
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:21,705
God!

512
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,644
Hey, Joel, come in.

513
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,358
Joel, do you copy?

514
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,667
For some reason he's back early. Come on,
pick up!

515
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:05,994
I'll be damned.

516
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:09,831
Dude, come on!

517
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:22,487
Joel, do you copy?

518
01:27:26,532 --> 01:27:29,535
Oh, come on! He's on his way up there!

519
01:27:38,503 --> 01:27:40,421
Joel, you need to get out of there!

520
01:27:41,339 --> 01:27:44,384
He is coming up there right now! You need
to get out of there!

521
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:54,811
A?

522
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:02,151
A, you're not coming in very clear.
Can you repeat that? Over?

523
01:28:04,487 --> 01:28:05,488
Oh, shit.

524
01:28:06,197 --> 01:28:08,324
Joel! You need to get out of there!

525
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:11,077
He is coming there right now! Do you
copy?!

526
01:28:11,494 --> 01:28:13,288
A, do you copy? Over?

527
01:28:19,502 --> 01:28:20,503
Oh, shit.

528
01:30:41,018 --> 01:30:43,104
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

529
01:30:51,237 --> 01:30:54,031
Close the door! Close the goddamned door!

530
01:30:57,368 --> 01:31:01,789
Damnit, Joel! I thought he caught you.

531
01:31:02,331 --> 01:31:04,250
No. He didn't catch me.

532
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,252
I didn't even see him.

533
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:08,588
He didn't see me.

534
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:14,719
That makes one of us.

535
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:19,140
What do you mean?

536
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:25,062
He saw me on the balcony.

537
01:31:31,235 --> 01:31:32,236
Alright.

538
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:37,950
Well, I have some good news.

539
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:43,706
You just might be right.

540
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:47,043
Shit.

541
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,794
Yeah.

542
01:31:57,553 --> 01:31:59,472
I don't see another way around it.

543
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:01,891
We're going to have to split up again.

544
01:32:02,308 --> 01:32:03,601
You're right.

545
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:09,815
Alright, you take the stairs, I'll take
the elevator.

546
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:13,611
That way if he catches one of us,

547
01:32:13,736 --> 01:32:16,280
then at least the other can go get help.

548
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,991
Okay.

549
01:32:21,911 --> 01:32:25,831
We cannot lead him back to the twelfth
floor apartment.

550
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:29,377
No. That's got to be our number one
priority.

551
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:36,467
Okay. There's no time to waste.

552
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:40,638
I'll head towards the stairs. You take
the next elevator up, alright?

553
01:32:40,846 --> 01:32:44,225
Alright. Good luck.

554
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,561
You, too.

555
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:09,875
Whew.

556
01:38:01,917 --> 01:38:02,918
Joel?

557
01:39:10,194 --> 01:39:16,784
B. 1. 2. 1. 1.

558
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:50,192
I tried to lead him away, but he knows
where I live.

559
01:39:57,366 --> 01:39:58,367
Well,

560
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,288
I guess we have to go to the police.

561
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:08,919
But, I don't know what we'd tell them.

562
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:15,509
I mean, we show that to them, the first
thing they're going to say is, "It's a
piece of junk."

563
01:40:15,718 --> 01:40:19,304
You know? They're not going to put that
to a killing.

564
01:40:21,223 --> 01:40:25,686
Second, they're going to ask me where I
got it.

565
01:40:26,937 --> 01:40:32,484
I can't tell them I broke into his
apartment and took it. I'm going to have
to say something like,

566
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:36,071
I dug it out of his garbage.

567
01:40:41,535 --> 01:40:46,999
We have to do something, though. We can't
just let a murderer go free.

568
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:49,543
Yeah.

569
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:54,923
And if he is, in fact, a murderer,

570
01:40:55,424 --> 01:41:02,890
I don't like the thought of him running
around knowing where you live, where Mo
lives.

571
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:05,267
He could hurt you guys.

572
01:41:06,602 --> 01:41:08,187
Yeah, I know.

573
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:13,192
We have to figure something out.

574
01:41:17,154 --> 01:41:18,155
I mean...

575
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,327
there's nothing to figure out.

576
01:41:24,495 --> 01:41:27,289
We have to take our chances with the cops.

577
01:41:31,043 --> 01:41:32,920
I'll go there right now.

578
01:41:33,587 --> 01:41:37,007
I'll see if there's anyone at the station
who will take me seriously.

579
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:39,426
You stay here.

580
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:43,180
Keep the door locked. Keep an eye on Mo.

581
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:32,229
Hello?

582
01:42:37,943 --> 01:42:38,944
Yes.

583
01:42:57,004 --> 01:43:00,048
How did you get my number?

584
01:43:30,954 --> 01:43:32,789
Fine, I’ll meet you.

585
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:23,418
Mom!

586
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,171
Mom?!

587
01:51:23,468 --> 01:51:25,053
Look what I found.

588
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:26,680
Color!

589
01:51:27,555 --> 01:51:30,934
Not that I don't love green. It's my very
favorite color.

590
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:33,353
But, I just happened across these,

591
01:51:33,603 --> 01:51:37,774
and I thought we'd just add a little bit
of zing.

592
01:51:38,024 --> 01:51:40,443
There's nothing wrong with zing, is there?

593
01:51:40,610 --> 01:51:43,988
I mean, you're all acclimated as a new
friend, and now we have

594
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:48,410
some more new friends, I'm glad we waited
, though, until you felt more comfortable
, but

595
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:53,331
here's just a few more friends, and we
know how we love friends.

596
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:56,626
Alright, here we go!

597
01:51:57,377 --> 01:51:58,378
Whoo!

598
01:51:59,421 --> 01:52:00,839
Oh, I love it!

599
01:52:07,011 --> 01:52:08,012
We haven't lost it, Babe!

600
01:52:08,179 --> 01:52:13,476
These young people think they can dance.
Pssh. They can't dance.

601
01:52:15,603 --> 01:52:16,604
Whoo!

602
01:52:23,987 --> 01:52:25,905
Oh, this is so fun!

603
01:52:32,454 --> 01:52:34,789
We knew it was going to happen. Yeah.

604
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:39,377
Well, Mom, it's a beautiful day.

605
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:42,213
We're going to enjoy this. We're going to
celebrate.

606
01:52:42,380 --> 01:52:45,258
We're going to celebrate your life, Dad.

607
01:52:45,383 --> 01:52:48,178
Just like that! Okay?

608
01:52:53,892 --> 01:53:00,106
I was just telling Mom the other day,
when you came home from the service you
built...
