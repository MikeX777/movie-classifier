00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:39,301
(helicopter engine roaring)
(siren blaring)

5
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,360
- You sound real crazy right now.

6
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,179
- $100,000 does not sound crazy to me.

7
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:50,104
- If we get 10 girls working,

8
00:00:50,104 --> 00:00:52,050
we can make a million
and get out the game.

9
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,658
- We ain't even finished High School yet.

10
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:56,446
- Fuck High School, we
won't need High School

11
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:58,164
once we make this paper.

12
00:00:58,164 --> 00:00:59,310
- I ain't no hoe.

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,454
- You don't have to do it for the more.

14
00:01:01,454 --> 00:01:03,937
Look, once we recruit some
bitches, they all work for us.

15
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:05,662
We got a real plan girl.

16
00:01:05,662 --> 00:01:07,410
- My plan is to graduate High School,

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,067
and then go to college.

18
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,524
- Okay, wait, just take the vow,

19
00:01:11,524 --> 00:01:13,089
I'll get you out of it later.

20
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:14,303
- What vow?
- The vow

21
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:16,899
holding what at least
tell him you took it.

22
00:01:16,899 --> 00:01:19,983
- I'm not motherfucking
hallway for no fight.

23
00:01:19,983 --> 00:01:21,983
(intense dramatic music)

24
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:23,935
- You gonna take the vow and hold it.

25
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:25,975
Give me everything is
in your fucking purse.

26
00:01:25,975 --> 00:01:27,069
- I ain't got no money.

27
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:27,902
- Yes you do bitch.

28
00:01:27,902 --> 00:01:29,393
- You said you gonna buy your prom dress,

29
00:01:29,393 --> 00:01:31,431
you got some fucking money.

30
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:33,172
- Not for you.
- Nigga.

31
00:01:33,172 --> 00:01:35,479
(dramatic music)

32
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,903
- Get that bitch.

33
00:01:36,903 --> 00:01:38,365
- Got him Matgod.

34
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:43,099
- Cassius, help, Cassius, help (screams)

35
00:01:43,099 --> 00:01:45,730
- Get him Matgod.
(screams)

36
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,314
- Get her Matgod.

37
00:01:47,314 --> 00:01:49,269
- Help.
- Bitch, call me Matgod,

38
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:51,488
don't call that call Matgod.

39
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,559
- You say Matgod bitch.
- Get that Matgod.

40
00:01:53,559 --> 00:01:54,392
- Yeah.
(scream)

41
00:01:54,392 --> 00:01:55,225
- This is my dick

42
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:56,447
all up in here, bitch.
- Yeah.

43
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:58,944
(screams)
- Fuck.

44
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:01,038
(groans)
- Cassius.

45
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,288
(gun shot)

46
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:16,424

00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:05,125
(upbeat piano music)

00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:08,906
(heart beats)
(clock ticking)

52
00:03:08,906 --> 00:03:10,081
- [Pastor] Oh got to church.

53
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,087
If you are gonna be a participant.

54
00:03:12,087 --> 00:03:13,266
- [Congregation] Okay, yeah.

55
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:16,961
- [Pastor] And the
redemptive movement of God.

56
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:18,195
- [Congregation] Yeah.

57
00:03:18,195 --> 00:03:20,581
- [Pastor] you've got to be prepared

58
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:22,044
to handle a life of tragedy.

59
00:03:22,044 --> 00:03:24,627
- [Congregation] Oh yeah, amen!

60
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:30,120
- [Pastor] Nobody including
Jesus, can participate

61
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,460
in the redemptive movement of God

62
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,834
without experiencing tragedy.

63
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:34,928
- [Congregation] All right, amen.

64
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:35,800
- [Pastor] Can I get on with it?

65
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,633
- [Congregation] All right.

66
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,872
- [Pastor] And when you
have experienced tragedy,

67
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:44,205
only then can God use you to participate

68
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:47,530
in the redemptive
movement of somebody else.

69
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,054
- [Congregation] All right.

70
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,424
- [Pastor] So you can say I'm set.

71
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,257
(clock ticking)
- [Congregation] All right.

72
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:54,410
- [Pastor] Well there you see.
- [Congregation] Yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,338
- [Pastor] Have I got a witness?

74
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:56,807
- [Congregation] Oh yeah.

75
00:03:56,807 --> 00:03:59,234
- [Pastor] I don't care what you say,

76
00:03:59,234 --> 00:04:02,817
death is tragic.
- [Congregation] Yes, yeah.

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,919
- [Pastor] Death is tragedy.
- [Congregation] Yeah.

78
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,063
- [Pastor] But I know God has a way

79
00:04:09,063 --> 00:04:10,808
of bringing triumph out of tragedy.

80
00:04:10,808 --> 00:04:11,641
- [Congregation] Yeah.

81
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:13,688
- [Pastor] But he's got to have tragedy

82
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:14,760
to bring triumph out of.

83
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,718
- [Congregation] Yeah, triumph.

84
00:04:16,718 --> 00:04:18,179
- [Pastor] Is still tragedy.

85
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,367
- [Congregation] Yeah.
(door banging)

86
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,342
- [Pastor] Are you listening?
(doorbell rings)

87
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:21,428
- [Congregation] Yeah.
(doorbell rings)

88
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:26,428
- [Pastor] Now listen, God
(door knocks) has never greatly

89
00:04:28,211 --> 00:04:32,544
used anybody, who has not
experienced great tragedy.

90
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,814
- [Congregation] Yeah, yeah.
(doorbell rings)

91
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:39,754
(door knocking)
- Come in.

92
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:42,058
(clock ticking)
(audience chattering)

93
00:04:42,058 --> 00:04:43,678
- Don't you think it's a little dangerous

94
00:04:43,678 --> 00:04:47,062
to keep your door unlocked
in this neighborhood?

95
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:49,563
Hi, I'm Ms Tayback from the
Internal Revenue Service.

96
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,602
We've sent you several certified letters

97
00:04:51,602 --> 00:04:55,352
but they've all come
back returned to sender.

98
00:04:57,404 --> 00:04:59,868
(laughs)

99
00:04:59,868 --> 00:05:03,291
- Oh sweet I have the
IRS coming to my house,

100
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,778
when they usually come to my bank account.

101
00:05:05,778 --> 00:05:08,836
- Well, I am trying to handle
my case a little differently.

102
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:10,631
I think this may just be a simple mistake.

103
00:05:10,631 --> 00:05:13,200
According to our records,
you have been claiming

104
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,030
your daughter as a dependent
since she was born.

105
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,826
That would make her 34 at this time.

106
00:05:19,826 --> 00:05:21,762
But we have information
that she passed away.

107
00:05:21,762 --> 00:05:24,475
- She did not pass away, her destiny

108
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,815
was denied by a murderer.

109
00:05:26,815 --> 00:05:28,485
- I'm sorry for your
loss, I truly am sorry.

110
00:05:28,485 --> 00:05:30,494
- You know you don't
have to be sorry, okay?

111
00:05:30,494 --> 00:05:32,239
There's enough sorry people in this world.

112
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,822
What do you want me to be, huh?

113
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:38,310
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

114
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,076
What are you here for?

115
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,147
You need what?
- You owe the government

116
00:05:41,147 --> 00:05:44,814
$63,000 and we will put
a lien on your house

117
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:48,968
and sell it in order to pay your debt.

118
00:05:48,968 --> 00:05:51,511
- I am 65 years old and retired.

119
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:53,553
What am I supposed to do?

120
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,357
What am I supposed to do?

121
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:57,988
- I am just reading from
the letter here, ma'am.

122
00:05:57,988 --> 00:05:59,811
- Wait, does that letter say miss ma'am

123
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:02,998
don't even ma'am me, Ms. Tayback.

124
00:06:02,998 --> 00:06:04,199
What the fuck does that letter say?

125
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,279
Does that letter say
that I bought my house

126
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:08,529
40 years ago, 40 years ago.

127
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:12,846
Working for my government,
at the Post Office.

128
00:06:12,846 --> 00:06:14,032
- But you didn't-
- What, no.

129
00:06:14,032 --> 00:06:15,566
- You didn't let me finish.
(sighs)

130
00:06:15,566 --> 00:06:18,048
- I think there is a
program, that can help you

131
00:06:18,048 --> 00:06:20,196
if I can just find the paperwork

132
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:21,652
for it and have you fill it out.

133
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:24,201
- I'm not filling out
shit, do you hear me?

134
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,485
You think I'm some kind of fool
that I'm gonna let you come

135
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:28,421
into my house and take my house.

136
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,703
And then you say I willingly did it, no.

137
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:35,297
The only way I'm gonna leave this house,

138
00:06:35,297 --> 00:06:37,047
is inside a pine box.

139
00:06:37,989 --> 00:06:39,063
- Let me help you.
- Oh, no, no,

140
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:40,371
shut the fuck up.
- Please, let me help you.

141
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:41,839
I can help you fill out these papers

142
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,283
so that we can start the process.

143
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:46,056
- You know what, my baby
was a rightful deduction,

144
00:06:46,056 --> 00:06:47,755
a rightful deduction.

145
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,679
That was taking away from me, oh, shit.

146
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:54,245
And I paid my taxes that was
supposed to go to the police,

147
00:06:54,245 --> 00:06:56,153
to find the person who killed my daughter.

148
00:06:56,153 --> 00:07:01,153
But no, instead they're laying
off the police in Oakland.

149
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,696
They laid him off, are those Tax Dollars?

150
00:07:06,672 --> 00:07:11,672
Fuck, I mean, the Tax Dollars,
are they going to a resources

151
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:16,148
to find the killer of my daughter?

152
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:20,520
- I don't, I'm just a Tax
Collector, Mrs. Sparks.

153
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,770
Look, Mrs. Sparks, I don't know very much

154
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,488
about your particular case
but, I'm here because I care.

155
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:30,396
I'm here to help, to help people like you,

156
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:31,935
to find a way out of a mess.

157
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:36,286
And maybe if you can't
pay, we can help you.

158
00:07:36,286 --> 00:07:41,286
Please just, (paper rustling)
just fill out these forms.

159
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,746

354
00:22:14,518 --> 00:22:17,353
- I see the news every
day in my head, all right?

355
00:22:17,353 --> 00:22:19,020
You know what I see?

356
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:25,558
I see me in jail for the rest of my life

357
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:26,788

358
00:22:26,788 --> 00:22:28,461
- That's right, you didn't do it, okay?

359
00:22:28,461 --> 00:22:30,674
When they start running DNA and whatnot

360

363
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,260
Your shit ain't even in the system.

364
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,446

we saw somebody get killed

365
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,931
and didn't say anything about it.

366

00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:57,037
he's gonna be snitching on us.

369

370
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,421

371
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:07,171

375
00:23:16,639 --> 00:23:18,741

00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:15,794
out by her boyfriend.

692
00:37:15,794 --> 00:37:18,411
And I was a little busy that weekend.

693
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:22,849
We had a white officer
shoot an unarmed black man.

694
00:37:22,849 --> 00:37:25,902
And people were about to
riot so I spent all my time

695
00:37:25,902 --> 00:37:27,903
on crowd control.

696
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:32,397
We didn't have DNA so we had
to depend on concerned citizens

697
00:37:32,397 --> 00:37:35,492
in our part of town snitches don't exist.

698
00:37:35,492 --> 00:37:38,404
- So that's what took the
officers off the Sparks murder?

699
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:40,400
- Emphasis of the Sparks
murders not the issue.

700
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,561
You know, nobody gives a
damn when a kid gets murdered

701
00:37:43,561 --> 00:37:45,434
a black one at that.

702
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:48,806
Man we did everything we could
there was a riot going on.

703
00:37:48,806 --> 00:37:52,771
Thousand people showed
up to protest this slime

704
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,828
that just robbed a bank that
gotten shot by a white officer.

705
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:59,133
But nobody cared about these kids, nobody.

706
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:03,139
It was a funniest thing ever
saw the next month I retired.

707
00:38:03,139 --> 00:38:07,107
Now I do this, I work with
some kids that I can say.

708
00:38:07,107 --> 00:38:09,139
So if you gentlemen can excuse me,

709
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:11,880
I got a rehearsal in progress.

710
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:16,631
All right, you guys, let's
take it over from the top.

711
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:19,795
And Hoby pull up your pants.

712
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:21,246
- Ma'am thank you for your time.

713
00:38:21,246 --> 00:38:23,277
But the whole reason we're
here is we just came across

714
00:38:23,277 --> 00:38:25,480
some new information on
Archie Andrews when your prime

715
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,791
suspects back then and
we just had to follow up.

716
00:38:29,791 --> 00:38:33,291
- Wait, I always thought Archie was dirty,

717
00:38:34,657 --> 00:38:37,074
but we never had anything on.

718
00:38:38,076 --> 00:38:40,672
The thing you really need to
know is that if he committed

719
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:43,029
the crime, he did it as a juvenile.

720
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,361
And so we'll be prosecuted as a juvenile

721
00:38:45,361 --> 00:38:49,694
and nothing much is ever
gonna happen to him, sorry.

722
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:55,854
Okay kids, let's take it from the top.

723
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:10,946
- Come in.
- Hi, Mrs. Sparks,

724
00:39:10,946 --> 00:39:12,372
we spoke on the phone under tech.

725
00:39:12,372 --> 00:39:16,039
- Davenport yes, I'm
so excited to meet you.

726
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,985
(laughs) Have a sit.
- Thank you.

727
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,413
I want to be with you face to face

728
00:39:23,413 --> 00:39:25,812
and find out from you
what you might remember

729
00:39:25,812 --> 00:39:27,312
and maybe wanna share.

730
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:29,307
I have to tell you, I'm
only on this part time.

731
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:31,083
So the results you get
might not be as fast

732
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,409
as you would like but
we will find the person

733
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:36,076
who did this.
- Persons, persons.

734
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,070
There was more than one.

735
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,926
That's what they had to
shoot her she was strong

736
00:39:40,926 --> 00:39:43,567
she could fight, she was not pushover.

737
00:39:43,567 --> 00:39:45,271
- There was quite a bit of blood evidence.

738
00:39:45,271 --> 00:39:46,104
- Yeah well.
- But only

739
00:39:46,104 --> 00:39:47,581
from one male and her.

740
00:39:47,581 --> 00:39:48,539
- Mm.
- Now however,

741
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:51,298
there was DNA evidence on a crack pipe.

742
00:39:51,298 --> 00:39:52,131
- Mm.
- And fingerprints

743
00:39:52,131 --> 00:39:53,714
from two other individuals.

744
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:57,036
I was reading some reports
and I saw similar notations

745
00:39:57,036 --> 00:39:59,020
that you had a hunch that her girlfriend

746
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,405
Mercedes Riviera had information.

747
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:02,806
- Mm, Mercedes do that have her?

748
00:40:02,806 --> 00:40:04,411
Well, let me just tell you this.

749
00:40:04,411 --> 00:40:06,395
My daughter was very honest with me.

750
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:07,622
She said she was not hanging

751
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,872
out with that Jezebel Mercedes anymore.

752
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:14,820
My daughter's graduating she was accepted

753
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,246
to San Jose State University.

754
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:19,500
She was majoring in communications.

755
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,583
That girl was jealous of her, mm.

756
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:27,000
And that boyfriend of hers,
someone the pimp his name

757
00:40:27,855 --> 00:40:28,911
was called what?

758
00:40:28,911 --> 00:40:30,794
(laughs)
Matgod,

759
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:32,283
kind of a fool was that?

760
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:33,200
- Mm.
- Huh?

761
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,356
Matgod.

804

- It could be a week.
- I don't Smoke.

805
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:12,855
Take a look around if you want.

806
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,850

807
00:42:18,637 --> 00:42:22,220

- Nice to meet you.
(tense music)

834
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:33,153
- That's what I'm talking about.

835
00:44:33,153 --> 00:44:35,457
That's what you need to
get out of this school.

836
00:44:35,457 --> 00:44:39,874

838
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,231
and watch cable TV and lift away.

839
00:44:48,231 --> 00:44:51,053
I don't want him to rot
in jail, I want him dead.

840
00:44:51,053 --> 00:44:53,791
I want his family dead,
I want his parents dead.

00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,142
I want anything and anyone
that has to do with him dead.

842
00:44:57,142 --> 00:44:59,467
- You know what this is
your own fucking fault.

843
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,290
This is your fault.
- How is it my fault?

844
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,874

846
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:06,727
I shouldn't have paid for

00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:09,761
or the second one.
- Well I didn't ask you to.

848
00:45:09,761 --> 00:45:10,794
- No, you know what?

849
00:45:10,794 --> 00:45:15,544
But I want you to be another
fucking statistic out there.

850
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:17,588

851
00:45:17,588 --> 00:45:19,962

852
00:45:19,962 --> 00:45:23,962

00:45:27,801 --> 00:45:30,209
What are you doing back there anyway, huh?

855
00:45:30,209 --> 00:45:32,472
Smoking, fucking, drinking.

856
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:34,743
You want to do that shit did you?

857
00:45:34,743 --> 00:45:39,410
You wanted it, look at you

862
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:11,523
The Cold Case cop he told

863
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:14,690
me that he could find Erica's killers.

864
00:46:16,437 --> 00:46:20,770
- Oh (clears throat) that's great.

865
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:22,568
- Did he it's like, a coast coming

866
00:46:22,568 --> 00:46:24,342
back to haunt those bastards.

867
00:46:24,342 --> 00:46:26,487
- Unless you think there's
more than one person.

868
00:46:26,487 --> 00:46:31,487
They have blood from one,
but fingerprints from three.

869
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:33,966
(siren blarring)
This Cold Case

870
00:46:33,966 --> 00:46:35,764
cop is for real.

871
00:46:35,764 --> 00:46:38,910
If they just wouldn't confessed,
maybe we could have helped

872
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,660
them but they didn't.

873
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:45,393
They made us confine them
and for that they must pay

874
00:46:45,393 --> 00:46:48,165
the ultimate price.
(sighs)

875
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:51,432
- Well sounds like he
knows what he's doing.

876
00:46:51,432 --> 00:46:54,311
(upbeat music)

877
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,297
- Charlie has some depression.

878
00:46:56,297 --> 00:46:58,880
(upbeat music)

879
00:47:01,932 --> 00:47:04,562
That's why you are depressed
and she does that's why.

880
00:47:04,562 --> 00:47:07,528

1008
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:19,507

1014
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:33,379
But Lord lifted me.

1015
00:53:33,379 --> 00:53:35,782
- [Pastor] Lord stood me up on my feet.

1016
00:53:35,782 --> 00:53:36,718

00:53:36,718 --> 00:53:39,405

1018
00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:41,822

- Lord I just want

1019
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:48,055
to just God, God damn rest with
her, I just want really her.

1020
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:52,518
Just don't know what happened.

1021
00:53:52,518 --> 00:53:55,843
- When the doctor came in, he
told me that she had been shot

1022
00:53:55,843 --> 00:53:59,676
that he had to be the
mirror, mirror bad news.

1023
00:54:13,171 --> 00:54:16,101
And I knew she wasn't gonna make it.

1024
00:54:16,101 --> 00:54:17,165
That she wasn't gonna make it,

1025
00:54:17,165 --> 00:54:19,501
that she's been shot in the head.

1026
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:22,636
And it was small caliber good.

1027
00:54:22,636 --> 00:54:25,691
The bullet hit going through her brain.

1028
00:54:25,691 --> 00:54:29,024
And then launched on the side over here.

1029
00:54:30,439 --> 00:54:34,427
And I asked them when they're
gonna try to remove the bullet

1030
00:54:34,427 --> 00:54:38,844
and he said no that your
brain had been was expanding

1031
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:44,238
in, they had her put her on life support.

1032
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:49,227
And we would see they would do some tests

1033
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:54,621
and find out how she
could do in the morning.

1034
00:54:56,849 --> 00:55:01,849
So we, I stayed that night
and I was able to go and see

1035
00:55:02,148 --> 00:55:05,898
her but it was cut, like
she was just asleep.

1036
00:55:07,782 --> 00:55:10,865
(upbeat tense music)

1037
00:55:41,448 --> 00:55:42,849

♪ No one ♪

1039
00:55:43,931 --> 00:55:48,183
- Yes, I carry a gun and I keep it loaded.

1040
00:55:48,183 --> 00:55:50,926
And I put little crosses on the bullets,

1041
00:55:50,926 --> 00:55:55,893
and I sprinkle holy water on
them to find the basturds,

1042
00:55:55,893 --> 00:55:58,075
I'm gonna shut that roll up his ass

1043
00:55:58,075 --> 00:56:01,577
and I'll send them home right to Jesus.

1044
00:56:01,577 --> 00:56:06,577
The Holy Spirit is the feminine
side of the Trinity, right?

1045
00:56:07,193 --> 00:56:10,110
- That is an interpretation.
- Okay.

1046
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,903
So the thing that came down on the force

1047
00:56:15,803 --> 00:56:17,886
was a woman, right?
- Yes,

1048
00:56:19,131 --> 00:56:20,393
it was a feminine spirit.

1049
00:56:20,393 --> 00:56:22,152
But what does that have
to do with you carrying

1050
00:56:22,152 --> 00:56:24,528
a gun for the last 20 years?

1051
00:56:24,528 --> 00:56:28,778
- I am rendering help to
the Lord, I am his helper.

1052
00:56:29,738 --> 00:56:33,363
There are more than 300
murders in this city alone.

1053
00:56:33,363 --> 00:56:38,196
And more than half of them are
juvenile, kids, black boys.

1054
00:56:39,297 --> 00:56:40,963
I'm here to help God.

1055
00:56:40,963 --> 00:56:44,122
- You just can't go
around murdering people.

1056
00:56:44,122 --> 00:56:48,431
- James I don't hear you
complaining, I'm kidding.

- Mr. Dassault, Mr. Dassault.

1066
00:58:25,266 --> 00:58:27,849
- [Radio] At one goal off 3:40.

1067
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,760
- Got your coffee.

1068
00:58:32,888 --> 00:58:35,417
- It's three o'clock
in the fucking morning.

1069
00:58:35,417 --> 00:58:37,320
Does it always take this long.

1070
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,355
- I'm sorry, sir, we've been
on the other side interviewing

1071
00:58:39,355 --> 00:58:41,969
witnesses we're moving as fast as we can.

1072
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:45,158
- I didn't even see these guys.

1073
00:58:45,158 --> 00:58:49,158
(sighs)
- That girl is critical.

1074
00:58:50,595 --> 00:58:52,776
She's been in surgery
for the last eight hours.

1075
00:58:52,776 --> 00:58:55,848
The bullet is three
centimeters from her heart.

1076
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:58,546
The boys brains been without
oxygen for over an hour.

1077
00:58:58,546 --> 00:59:01,171
So in reality, even if he makes it,

1078
00:59:01,171 --> 00:59:03,588
he'd probably be a vegetable.

1079
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:09,179
Do you see the shoes?

1080
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:15,778
- I didn't see the faces I was
going the opposite direction?

1081
00:59:15,778 --> 00:59:17,996
I didn't see their faces.

1082
00:59:17,996 --> 00:59:21,134
- I understand you're a Sculptor?

1083
00:59:21,134 --> 00:59:23,551
- Yes.
- So you're pretty good

1084
00:59:24,419 --> 00:59:28,413
at facial details.
- Imaginary creations

1085
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:30,496
not real people.
- Really?

1086
00:59:33,095 --> 00:59:36,012
Your work is primarily facial plus.

1087
00:59:40,652 --> 00:59:42,327
- Where did you find my work?

1088
00:59:42,327 --> 00:59:45,028
- Where else the internet,

1089
00:59:45,028 --> 00:59:47,064

1090
00:59:47,064 --> 00:59:49,849
Schomburg Museum Harlan,
the African American Museum

1091
00:59:49,849 --> 00:59:51,614
Los Angeles had a whole wing dedicated

1092
00:59:51,614 --> 00:59:53,531
to you a few years ago.

1093
00:59:56,213 --> 00:59:59,546
- Expressionistic abstract facial busts.

1094
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:05,726
I create those faces,
they're not real people.

1095
01:00:05,726 --> 01:00:07,996
(gun shots)

1096
01:00:07,996 --> 01:00:09,472
- No, fuck all that shit.

1097
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:12,248
My question is, what
are you doing teaching

1098
01:00:12,248 --> 01:00:14,870
in High School in the hood?

1099
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:18,197
I mean you should be some big
time college professor, right?

1100
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:23,085
- I teach here at Tyumen
because I graduated from Tyumen.

1101
01:00:23,085 --> 01:00:24,319
I wanna help out my community.

1102
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,237
- You wanna help out your community?

1103
01:00:26,237 --> 01:00:30,320
Help me, now you sure you
don't see the shooters?

1104
01:00:40,134 --> 01:00:42,884
- Those two look familiar.
- Yeah.

1105
01:00:45,999 --> 01:00:48,806
- Damn it what's he done in here?

1106
01:00:48,806 --> 01:00:49,806
- Who?
- Him.

1107
01:00:50,792 --> 01:00:54,441
- That's King dirt, he
runs three street gangs,

1108
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:59,024
drugs, teen prostitution, if
it's dirty, he's doing it.

1109
01:01:02,661 --> 01:01:03,744
You know him?

1110
01:01:05,266 --> 01:01:08,068
- Moved in High School together.

1111
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:10,745
- Yeah, well, he's a bad guy.

1112
01:01:10,745 --> 01:01:11,745
Lots of dirty money and dirty business

1113
01:01:11,745 --> 01:01:14,076
when it comes to that dude.

1114
01:01:14,076 --> 01:01:15,835
- Why isn't he in jail?

1115
01:01:15,835 --> 01:01:19,750
- We would love to lock him
up, we can touch him right now.

1116
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,205
The FBI has a whole other
investigation going on.

1117
01:01:22,205 --> 01:01:25,097
And the FEDs, told the local
so we'd have to wait until

1118
01:01:25,097 --> 01:01:29,670
we hear word back or they're
getting on a bigger charge.

1119
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:31,822
- A bigger charge like what?

1120
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:35,494
- I don't have that information, why?

1121
01:01:35,494 --> 01:01:37,852
- I'm just curious.

1122
01:01:37,852 --> 01:01:42,019
- Here's my card, if you
hear any noise, you call.

1123
01:01:49,276 --> 01:01:52,670
- [Announcer] Amy, she was
screaming for help unfortunately,

1124
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,590
she was mature enough and smart enough

1125
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:56,564
to know what was happening
to her and she was--

1126
01:01:56,564 --> 01:01:59,717
- I was waiting for you (laughs).

1127
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:02,418
- I made lunch--
- Oh Mrs. Sparks

1128
01:02:02,418 --> 01:02:05,835
I really don't have time for lunch today.

1129
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:09,023
But I could really use a home cooked meal

1130
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:10,773
you just made my day.

1131
01:02:14,005 --> 01:02:17,111
- [News Anchor] By special
forces reported today.

1132
01:02:17,111 --> 01:02:19,725
- Cassius my God, damn ass.

1133
01:02:19,725 --> 01:02:21,498
- [Woman] Found the information charges--

1134
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:24,108
- Those are fonny motherfuckers.

1135
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:26,383
- That's an important
case, it's civil right.

1136
01:02:26,383 --> 01:02:29,213
- Good about the civil rights
of the black boys killed

1137
01:02:29,213 --> 01:02:31,155
by who knows how many other black boys

1138
01:02:31,155 --> 01:02:32,519
in Oakland last night?

1139
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:35,352
How come nobody's
marching down the streets,

1140
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:38,104
calling to find the murders
of these children, huh?

1141
01:02:38,104 --> 01:02:40,121
I'll tell you why, because the murderers

1142
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:42,264
are their children, mm.

1143
01:02:42,264 --> 01:02:46,916
That man is an easy target,
fight a real fight, bitch,

1144
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:48,828
fight a real fight.

1145
01:02:48,828 --> 01:02:51,099
- Nobody wants to be called a snitch.

1146
01:02:51,099 --> 01:02:54,930
- Nobody wants their lives
to be denied by some animal

1147
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:57,943
who lives in this society
who doesn't belong

1148
01:02:57,943 --> 01:02:59,860
with the rest of us?

1149
01:02:59,860 --> 01:03:02,110
He calls him a snitch, huh?

1150
01:03:03,175 --> 01:03:07,050
One I call them a hero, what's
wrong with being a hero?

1151
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:11,174
I am a mother who is suffering,

1152
01:03:11,174 --> 01:03:16,091

chance I get oh Jesus help me.

1155
01:03:30,982 --> 01:03:34,060

I told you to text I

01:03:36,219 --> 01:03:38,025
- Why you have me come up here?

1158
01:03:38,025 --> 01:03:41,662
I told you I'm not doing

1159
01:03:41,662 --> 01:03:43,849

Are you okay?
- Such a pretty view.
