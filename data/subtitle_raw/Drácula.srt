That's right. Nosferatu the vampire.

But, Professor Van Helsing,
that theory is implausible.

227
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:27,149
Medical science nowadays does not accept
the existence of such a creature.

228
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,610

00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:34,436
Where?

366
00:47:40,484 --> 00:47:41,485
Eva.

367
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:44,071
No, Father. Please!

368
00:47:52,496 --> 00:47:54,331
What do you have on your neck?

369
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,291
Please, Father.

370
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:51,388
How long have you
had those marks on your neck?

371
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,265
Marks?

372
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:58,645
Since the day after that dream.

373
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,772
MAID: Count Dracula is here.

374
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:16,872
It's a pleasure to see you again, Doctor.

375
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:19,875
I was sure you were back.

376
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:27,382
Miss Seward.

377
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:32,762
SEWARD: Excuse me, Count Dracula.
This is Professor Van Helsing.

378
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:38,935
DRACULA: Van Helsing,
the distinguished man of science

379
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:42,981
whose fame is known
even in the mountains of Transylvania.

380
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:47,360
VAN HELSING: Doctor,
I beg you to excuse me,

381
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:51,615
but your daughter
had better go to her room immediately.

382
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:55,994
Aren't you feeling well?

383
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:59,247
I hope it's nothing serious.

384
00:49:59,331 --> 00:50:02,667
I had a terrible dream a few nights ago

385
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:05,962
and I haven't been able
to get it out of my mind.

386
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:14,763
Could it be you've taken
my stories too seriously?

387
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:16,348
Stories?

388
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:24,481
I made a humble effort
to entertain your fiancée

389
00:50:24,564 --> 00:50:27,692
by telling her a few of the legends,

390
00:50:27,776 --> 00:50:31,279
somewhat gloomy ones,
about my distant motherland.

391
00:50:31,363 --> 00:50:36,826
Daughter,
I'm sure Count Dracula will excuse you.

392
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,496
You must go your room

393
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:42,165
as Professor Van Helsing
has advised you to do.

394
00:50:42,249 --> 00:50:47,003
But, Father, I tell you I'm feeling fine now.

395
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:56,137
You'd better do as your father says.

396
00:50:57,556 --> 00:50:58,932
Very well, then.

397
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:07,399
SEWARD: Good night,
my dear daughter.

398
00:51:16,575 --> 00:51:18,493
I must go, Doctor.

399
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,209
Professor Van Helsing,

400
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:30,589
I hope I shall
have the pleasure of seeing you again.

401
00:51:34,634 --> 00:51:36,261
EVA: Good night.

402
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:39,014
Good night, Juan.

403
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:41,808
DRACULA: Mr. Harker.

404
00:51:53,403 --> 00:51:56,990
DRACULA: I shall come by later
to enquire how you're feeling.

405
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,827
Thank you.

406
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:02,579
Good night, Miss Seward.

407
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,372
EVA: Good night.

408
00:52:45,747 --> 00:52:50,627
I'm very sorry that my visit was so untimely.

409
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:52,003
SEWARD: Not at all.

410
00:52:52,128 --> 00:52:53,463
VAN HELSING: On the contrary,

411
00:52:53,546 --> 00:52:56,549
it may turn out to be of great importance.

412
00:52:56,633 --> 00:53:01,638
Moreover, before you leave,
you could be helpful to us.

413
00:53:01,721 --> 00:53:06,184
It will be a pleasure to do whatever I can.

414
00:53:14,401 --> 00:53:18,405
Just a moment ago,
I discovered an amazing phenomenon.

415
00:53:18,488 --> 00:53:23,702
Something so incredible
that I do not trust my own eyes

416
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:27,414
and I'd like you to help me prove it.

417
00:53:31,418 --> 00:53:33,128
Look.

418
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:08,288
Dr. Seward, please accept my apologies.

419
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:11,249
I couldn't help it.

420
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:26,848
Considering that you have not yet lived

421
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:29,976
even one entire lifetime,

422
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:33,396
you are a wise man, Professor.

423
00:54:50,830 --> 00:54:53,541
Did you see the expression on his face?

424
00:54:53,625 --> 00:54:56,544
He looked like an enraged beast.

425
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:04,344
Dracula is our vampire.

426
00:55:04,427 --> 00:55:05,929
Vampire?

427
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:08,139
For God's sake, Professor!

428
00:55:08,223 --> 00:55:11,976
Vampires cast no reflection in a mirror.

429
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,355
That is why Dracula shattered that mirror.

430
00:55:15,438 --> 00:55:19,609
Look, Professor,
this makes no sense whatsoever.

431
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:23,738
Dracula is the monster
who killed Lucía Weston.

432
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:27,283
The same one who left
those marks on Miss Eva's neck.

433
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,285
Him?

434
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:32,288
Well, please understand
that I mean no offense

435
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:37,377
but that's more like something
one of the patients here might say.

436
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:42,465
Yes! And that's exactly
what physicians in this country

437
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,676
and the police will think.

438
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,387
What gives vampires their power

439
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,849
is the fact that people
refuse to believe in them.

440
00:56:23,756 --> 00:56:26,885
But, Professor,
according to your own theory,

441
00:56:26,968 --> 00:56:31,264
the vampire must
return to his grave before dawn.

442
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:34,309
He must return to his native land,

443
00:56:34,392 --> 00:56:36,477
which is where he was buried.

444
00:56:36,561 --> 00:56:41,441
Now, Count Dracula's
native land is Transylvania.

445
00:56:41,524 --> 00:56:44,903
Then he must have
brought some of his native soil with him.

446
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:49,073
Perhaps in boxes big enough
to serve as his bed.

447
00:56:49,524 --> 00:56:50,791
<i>(MANIACAL LAUGHTER)</i>

448
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,634
SEWARD: Come on, come on.

449
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,180
Come on.

450
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,060
Renfield, what were you doing out there?

451
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:23,441
Come on. Come with me.

452
00:57:31,324 --> 00:57:35,954
Renfield, did you hear what we were saying?

453
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,336
Pay attention to what he's telling you.

454
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:46,631
That is your only salvation.

455
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:53,179
And the same is true for her.

456
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:05,233
Save me! Save my soul!

457
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:09,570
Save me! Save me!

458
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,743
I am weak. You are strong.

459
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:19,914
I am crazy. You are sane.

460
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:26,838
I shall save you.

461
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:30,550
But you must tell us everything you know.

462
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,343
Everything.

463
00:58:35,344 --> 00:58:36,344
(LAUGHS)

464
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:41,144
Fool! Fool!

465
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:45,273
And I thought you were a wise man.

466
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:51,612
What do I stand to gain
by telling you everything?

467
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:57,744
That physician keeps me
locked up here all day.

468
00:58:57,827 --> 00:59:02,749
And when I behave nicely,
he gives me a bit of sugar

469
00:59:02,832 --> 00:59:05,126
so that I can catch flies.

470
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:10,715
But if I serve the Master...

471
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:17,430
An intelligent madman would rather serve

472
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:20,224
the one who can grant him life.

473
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:24,645
Him? Who are you talking about?

474
00:59:27,315 --> 00:59:32,070
Why mention names
among friends, Professor?

475
00:59:32,153 --> 00:59:34,906
What ties do you have with Dracula?

476
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,827
Dracula?

477
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:45,416
I've never even heard that name before.

478
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,502
You're lying!

479
00:59:49,504 --> 00:59:52,423
Crazy people, Professor,

480
00:59:52,507 --> 00:59:55,718
do not have the ability to distinguish

481
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:58,930
between what is true and false.

482
00:59:59,013 --> 01:00:03,351
For that reason, I take no offense.

483
01:00:13,528 --> 01:00:17,281
I begged you to let me out

484
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,700
but you wouldn't do it.

485
01:00:19,784 --> 01:00:23,996
Now it's too late. It has already happened.

486
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:25,790
What has happened?

487
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:32,380
I dare not say it. I dare not.

488
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:35,383
I would die in torment if I tried.

489
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:37,760
And you shall die in torment

490
01:00:37,885 --> 01:00:41,389
if you let innocent blood stain your soul.

491
01:00:41,472 --> 01:00:42,765
No!

492
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:50,064
God will not condemn
the soul of a poor madman.

493
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:53,985
He knows very well that the power of evil

494
01:00:54,068 --> 01:00:58,739
is too great for those of us with weak minds

495
01:00:58,823 --> 01:01:01,909
to resist.

496
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:08,082
Then, Renfield, trust me.

497
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:12,253
Tell me what I want to know.

498
01:01:13,421 --> 01:01:15,214
What do you want to know?

that has deranged your mind.

We must confront it.

No. What do you need?

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,086
"a little after nightfall.

545
01:05:23,212 --> 01:05:27,007
"The testimony given by two girls,

546
01:05:31,846 --> 01:05:38,018
"both confirm it's a beautiful lady
dressed in white

547
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:42,982
"whose modus operandi is to offer

01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:46,360
"candy to her victim.

01:05:46,444 --> 01:05:50,865
"She then lures the victim
to a deserted corner

550
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:55,035
"where she delicately bites
the victim's neck."

551
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:11,010
What would she know
about the lady in white?

552
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,928
Why would she know anything about it?

553
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:14,930
She shouldn't have read that.

554
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,974
For God's sake, Mr. Harker!

555
01:06:20,144 --> 01:06:24,398
When did you see
Lucía again after she was buried?

556
01:06:26,609 --> 01:06:29,612
Once when I was on the terrace.

557
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:33,449
She came out of the shadows.

558
01:06:35,493 --> 01:06:38,245
She came towards me.

559
01:06:38,329 --> 01:06:41,457
She stopped and stared at me.

560
01:06:41,582 --> 01:06:43,626
I began to speak to her.

561
01:06:45,586 --> 01:06:47,338
And then

562
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:51,634
I remembered

563
01:06:53,511 --> 01:06:55,429
that she was dead.

564
01:07:01,852 --> 01:07:07,274
Her face took on a horrible expression

565
01:07:09,401 --> 01:07:11,862
like that of a hungry beast.

566
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:15,366
Like a wolf.

567
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:19,787
She turned

568
01:07:20,955 --> 01:07:25,000
and disappeared into the fog again.

569
01:07:28,003 --> 01:07:33,133
So the lady dressed in white was...

570
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:38,722
Lucía.

571
01:07:47,231 --> 01:07:51,610
Miss, I promise you that from this day on,

572
01:07:51,694 --> 01:07:53,404
Lucía will rest in peace.

573
01:07:53,487 --> 01:07:57,616
Her soul will be forever freed

574
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,994
of that awful appetite.

575
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:04,373
Since you can save
Lucía's soul after her death,

576
01:08:04,498 --> 01:08:07,710
promise me you'll save mine too.

577
01:08:07,835 --> 01:08:11,755
You're not going to die, my love.
You will go on living.

578
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:15,467
No, Juan, you mustn't touch me.

579
01:08:15,551 --> 01:08:18,554
And you mustn't kiss me ever again.

580
01:08:19,555 --> 01:08:21,682
What are you saying?

581
01:08:21,765 --> 01:08:25,269
Professor, explain it to him.

582
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:26,979
Tell him.

583
01:08:27,062 --> 01:08:28,772
I can't.

584
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:44,038
Eva.

585
01:08:49,543 --> 01:08:53,505
Juan, it's over between us.

586
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:56,884
Our love, our wedding plans.

587
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,933
Please, Juan, don't look at me like that.

588
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:08,020
I love you.

589
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:10,397
I love you more than life itself.

590
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:15,527
But this terrible thing...

591
01:09:15,611 --> 01:09:18,614
He wants it to be this way

592
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:22,409
and I must obey.

593
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:33,379
HARKER: You know what you're doing?

594
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,756
You're driving her crazy.

595
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:43,972
Mr. Harker, you should be worried
about what's out there.

596
01:09:45,182 --> 01:09:49,353
The last rays of the sun are gone.

597
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:52,981
Night hovers over us again.

598
01:10:07,830 --> 01:10:12,793
We've put wolfsbane in this room
and in your bedroom

599
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:16,547
to free you from Dracula,
in case he comes back.

600
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:18,632
She'll be free of him, all right,

601
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:22,594
because either she returns with me
to London or I call the police.

602
01:10:22,678 --> 01:10:26,140
VAN HELSING: Seward, my friend,
I must be in charge here

603
01:10:26,223 --> 01:10:28,892
or whatever I do will be useless.

604
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:49,538
Miss Eva must keep
this branch of wolfsbane in her bed.

605
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:53,000
Be careful that
she doesn't drop it while she sleeps.

606
01:10:59,047 --> 01:11:03,218
Under no circumstances must those
windows be opened during the night.

607
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:06,054
I understand, Professor.

608
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:10,851
Come, my daughter.

(WINGS FLAPPING)

610
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,494
Yes, Master.

611
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:28,804
You've come back, Master.

612
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:37,354
Are you angry with me?

613
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:49,658
No, Master!

614
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:51,577
Please!

615
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:54,329
Not her!

616
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:56,874
Never again!

617
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:00,544
No, Master!

618
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:03,380
No! Not her!

619
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:06,174
No!

620
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:09,803
No! No!

621
01:13:10,012 --> 01:13:11,555
No! No!

622
01:13:16,727 --> 01:13:18,186
Please!

623
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:21,523
No, Master, please!

(RENFIELD HYPERVENTILATING)

625
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:30,908
Mr. Harker,

626
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:35,787
though I have devoted my life to
the study of the strangest things,

627
01:13:35,871 --> 01:13:41,293
little known facts that the world
is perhaps better off not knowing,

628
01:13:41,376 --> 01:13:46,340
a world content to busy itself
instead with mundane affairs.

629
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:50,427
Dracula's name is associated with a legend

630
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:54,556
still told among his fellow countrymen.

631
01:13:54,640 --> 01:14:00,062
The legend tells of an ancient family
that disappeared over five centuries ago

632
01:14:00,145 --> 01:14:03,649
and was said to be made up of vampires.

633
01:14:03,732 --> 01:14:06,860
Since I discovered, by chance,

634
01:14:06,944 --> 01:14:10,030
that Dracula cast no reflection in the mirror

635
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:11,782
and that in addition,

636
01:14:11,865 --> 01:14:15,327
that three large boxes
had been sent to Carfax Abbey,

637
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:16,745
and since I also knew that

638
01:14:16,828 --> 01:14:20,332
a vampire must sleep during the day
in his native earth,

639
01:14:20,415 --> 01:14:25,379
I quickly realized
that Dracula had to be the person

640
01:14:25,462 --> 01:14:27,631
whom Renfield calls "Master."

641
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:34,513
One of the undead who has been able
to prolong his life beyond its natural limits

642
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:39,393
by feeding on the blood
of other living creatures.

643
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:44,523
The only way we can save Eva

644
01:14:44,606 --> 01:14:49,987
is by finding the place
where the living corpse of the vampire rests

645
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:54,157
and driving a stake through its heart.

646
01:15:21,852 --> 01:15:27,607
What a strange conversation
for men who are not crazy!

647
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:31,862
Renfield, you will force me
to put you in a straitjacket.

648
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:38,368
I'm afraid that would be
of no use at this point.

649
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:10,609
What? What's that, Doctor?

650
01:16:10,692 --> 01:16:12,569
Again?

651
01:16:12,652 --> 01:16:14,738
I'm on my way, sir.

652
01:16:14,821 --> 01:16:16,698
Right away, Doctor.

653
01:16:19,951 --> 01:16:23,580
The doctor's favorite lunatic is at large again.

654
01:16:30,670 --> 01:16:35,092
Well, I'll be!
That madman must be Hercules himself.

655
01:16:35,175 --> 01:16:38,678
- What's he done now?
- Come and see for yourself.

DRACULA: From now on

657
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:58,990
any mental suggestion you receive from me

658
01:16:59,074 --> 01:17:01,618
must be carried out.

659
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:07,165
Whenever I want you to do something,

660
01:17:07,249 --> 01:17:09,334
it must be done.

661
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:12,629
It must be done.

662
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,340
When you come out of this state,

663
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:18,844
you will remember nothing
of what I am telling you now.

664
01:17:18,927 --> 01:17:21,054
Do you understand?

665
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:23,348
I understand.

666
01:17:23,431 --> 01:17:26,893
I have already told you what you must do.

667
01:17:26,977 --> 01:17:28,353
Now,

668
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:30,981
obey.

669
01:18:25,911 --> 01:18:29,956
Renfield, you know where those boxes are.

670
01:18:30,040 --> 01:18:33,293
Tell us and we shall protect you.

671
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:36,963
But I no longer need your protection.

672
01:18:37,047 --> 01:18:41,051
The Master is not angry with me.

673
01:18:41,134 --> 01:18:43,553
On the contrary, he's pleased.

674
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:46,765
He came to my window

675
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:51,603
in the moonlight and promised me things.

676
01:18:51,686 --> 01:18:55,857
Not to say them, but to do them.

677
01:18:55,941 --> 01:18:58,193
- VAN HELSING: Do them?
- Yes!

678
01:18:58,276 --> 01:19:01,696
To make them happen.

679
01:19:01,780 --> 01:19:06,368
A red mist spread over the lawn

680
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:09,663
and came towards me like a raging fire.

681
01:19:09,746 --> 01:19:13,124
Then the Master parted the mist

682
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:17,379
and revealed before my eyes
thousands of rats,

683
01:19:17,462 --> 01:19:22,217
their eyes inflamed like his own, but smaller.

684
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:26,471
He raised his hand and they all stopped.

685
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,723
I felt he was telling me,

686
01:19:29,557 --> 01:19:33,895
"Rats! Rats! Rats!

687
01:19:33,979 --> 01:19:37,315
"Thousands, millions of rats!

688
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:39,359
"And in each one of them,

"Yes! And many more!

01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:56,960
"For countless generations!

694
01:19:57,043 --> 01:19:59,337
"But you must obey."

695
01:19:59,421 --> 01:20:01,589
VAN HELSING: What did he want you to do?

696
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:04,092
What has already been done.

697
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:08,972
Dracula is in this house!

698
01:20:09,055 --> 01:20:11,891
Where else did you expect him to be?

699
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:15,395
He won't be able to cause any harm.

01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,564

This man is going to drive me crazy.

703
01:20:24,946 --> 01:20:30,952
He broke through those iron bars
as if they were toothpicks.

704
01:20:31,036 --> 01:20:32,912
Come with me, Martín.

705
01:20:32,996 --> 01:20:37,208
Let me show you somewhere
he'll never escape from.

01:20:37,292 --> 01:20:38,626
Let's go.

707
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:44,257
You may be right,
but I still say what St. Thomas said.

<i>DRACULA: Van Helsing.</i>

709
01:21:03,026 --> 01:21:07,113
Now that you've learned what you've learned,

01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:11,868
it would be wise to return to your country.

01:21:13,912 --> 01:21:20,543
I intend to stay and protect those

You're too late.

01:21:38,395 --> 01:21:41,106

Should you escape, Dracula,

01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:01,126
Of course I'm all right.

720

I've never felt better in my whole life.

721
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:28,403
Tell me, why are you staring at me like that?
