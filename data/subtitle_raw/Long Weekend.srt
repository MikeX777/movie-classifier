00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,854
<i>Hey, Mr. Waters, this is Jeremy
over in Dr. Andrews' office.</i>

3
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:48,315
<i>Just calling to confirm
your follow-up appointment</i>

4
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:49,524
<i>tomorrow at 2.</i>

5
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:52,360
<i>Call if you have questions.
We'll see you then.</i>

6
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,573
<i>Bart, it's Dr. Andrews.</i>

7
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,575
<i>We missed you
at your appointment yesterday,</i>

8
00:00:58,658 --> 00:01:01,286
{\an8}<i>so calling to check in.</i>

9
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:05,165
{\an8}<i>It's important we maintain contact
with patients for a few months</i>

10
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:06,666
<i>after they're under our care.</i>

11
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,086
<i>So let's get
another appointment in the books.</i>

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,256
<i>Just wanted to make sure
we avoid any backsliding.</i>

13
00:01:17,052 --> 00:01:19,095
<i>Hey, B, it's Whit.</i>

14
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:22,015
<i>I got a call
from a psychiatrist's office yesterday.</i>

15
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:25,560
<i>I guess I must still be listed
as your emergency contact.</i>

16
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:27,979
<i>You should probably change that
at some point.</i>

17
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:31,441
<i>Anyhow, they wanted you to call
to set up an appointment soon.</i>

18
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,485
<i>It's none of my business now,</i>

19
00:01:33,568 --> 00:01:36,363
<i>but I just wanna make sure
you're taking care of yourself.</i>

20
00:01:36,446 --> 00:01:40,033
<i>So call them, Bart, please.</i>

21
00:01:40,116 --> 00:01:41,826
<i>Okay? I'm thinking about you.</i>

22
00:01:44,788 --> 00:01:46,748
<i>Bart, it's Dr. Andrews again.</i>

23
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:49,668
<i>It's really pertinent
that you continue to...</i>

24
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,597
Okay. Well, I wish you hadn't done that.

25
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:05,976
But that doesn't make any sense. Yeah.

26
00:02:06,768 --> 00:02:08,936
- 409.
- Sorry, I dozed off there.

27
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,314
Okay. This is an old building,

28
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:14,818
so, you know, you have to be sensitive
about the plumbing.

29
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:16,570
- Can I?
- Help yourself.

30
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,989
Okay, well, you know, the rule of thumb

31
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,242
is that if it's bigger than a goldfish,
you don't flush it.

32
00:02:22,325 --> 00:02:23,952
No. Okay.

33
00:02:24,035 --> 00:02:26,872
No, I'll send a plumber over later.
Yeah. Bye.

34
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:30,458
That bitch tried
to flush a gerbil down the toilet.

35
00:02:30,542 --> 00:02:33,211
- Who does that?
- Are we allowed to have gerbils here?

36
00:02:33,295 --> 00:02:37,382
- Not anymore. Fuck.
- You're having a good day, aren't you?

37
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,552
You're lucky you have booze.
Thanks for the shot.

38
00:02:40,635 --> 00:02:43,096
- Yeah.
- We're showing this place in 20 minutes.

39
00:02:43,179 --> 00:02:45,348
- Is that okay?
- Yeah. I'm gonna get out of here.

40
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:48,435
- Bart, don't leave me.
- I wish I could stay,

41
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:51,271
but unless you get them
to lower the rent by...

42
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:53,648
like, all of it, I gotta go.

43
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:56,568
- What am I gonna do without you?
- You're gonna be fine.

44
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:57,861
Yeah, yeah.

45
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:00,780
So you'll be out
by the beginning of next month?

46
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:01,781
Yes, ma'am.

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,534
I'll miss you.

48
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,621
Oh, 206. I hate my fucking job.

49
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:09,372
Eddie, what?

50
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:11,458
I'm not doing that.

51
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:15,128
Because I cannot control when 306 has sex.

52
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:17,672
I can't tell someone
they have to fuck on their couch

53
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:19,841
because their mattress is too loud.

54
00:03:29,768 --> 00:03:31,478
Shit.

55
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,357
Come on in, man.
I'd offer to help, but my hands are full.

56
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,399
Also, I don't want to.

57
00:03:37,526 --> 00:03:40,403
- That all your shit?
- Not all of it but there's not much left.

58
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:43,490
Right on. We got plenty of space.
Teddy, don't do that.

59
00:03:43,573 --> 00:03:45,784
I'm not Teddy. I'm Naked Guy.

60
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:47,744
Well, Naked Guy, don't do that.

61
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:48,912
Jeez. Rachel!

62
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:52,040
- Rach!
- Jesus! I'm going to the bathroom.

63
00:03:52,123 --> 00:03:54,543
Eve needs you, and Naked Guy's
fucking up the chair again.

64
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:58,338
- I just want two seconds of peace.
- Oh, my God. I'm just a dad.

65
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,382
Let's get you situated. Come on.

66
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,552
Naked Guy!

67
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:05,929
Are you sure me staying here
isn't too much?

68
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,098
Fuck, no, man.
You need to get out of that place.

69
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:12,018
Besides, it'll be fun having you around.
Like old times, you know?

70
00:04:12,102 --> 00:04:14,229
Rachel? Rachel!

71
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,648
You could stay here
as long as you want. Seriously.

72
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,650
- Kids love you.
- Hey, I got her.

73
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:22,278
Listen, Teddy has left
something very upsetting

74
00:04:22,362 --> 00:04:24,614
next to the toilet on the floor,
if you could...

75
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:27,242
Hi, Bart. Welcome.
Happy to have you here.

76
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,702
Don't use the bathroom.

77
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:32,122
- Are you on your way?
- Yeah.

78
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,373
Okay. Bye.

79
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:35,584
I should be getting this job.

80
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:38,378
- I'll be out of your hair soon.
- Dude, shut up. All right?

81
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:41,631
You can stay here forever.
I mean that. Okay?

82
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:01,276
So, yeah, man.

83
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,778
I read through your samples,

84
00:05:03,862 --> 00:05:08,074
and I'm no literary critic or anything,
but they seem really good to me.

85
00:05:08,158 --> 00:05:09,743
- Thank you.
- For real, dude.

86
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:13,788
I love this one
about the guy whose fiancée left him

87
00:05:13,872 --> 00:05:15,498
and he has a nervous breakdown.

88
00:05:15,582 --> 00:05:18,084
I mean, that's... It feels so real.

89
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,088
- Well, it should.
- I thought <i>Marley & Me</i> was sad, but...

90
00:05:22,172 --> 00:05:24,090
Hey, you ever see <i>Marley & Me?</i>

91
00:05:25,467 --> 00:05:27,010
- I have not.
- You should.

92
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,055
I love dog movies.
But spoiler, the pup dies.

93
00:05:32,682 --> 00:05:35,101
I kind of feel
like you're too good for this job.

94
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:38,396
Well, thanks for saying that,
but, you know...

95
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,567
To be honest, stories like that
don't really help keep the lights on.

96
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:46,488
Well, you won't write anything
super creative for our catalogs,

97
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:50,283
- but I bet you'll have fun with it.
- Writing's writing to me, honestly.

98
00:05:50,367 --> 00:05:54,496
- So I am happy to tackle anything.
- Okay. It's pretty straightforward.

99
00:05:54,579 --> 00:05:56,373
We give you a product and research data,

100
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:59,167
and you write up something
that sounds exciting to our clients.

101
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:03,755
Like this fella.
This is a new catheter. You can hold it.

102
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:07,050
It's smaller and more malleable.
You barely even know it's there.

103
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,803
Well, you know it's there
because it's a huge tube

104
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,429
that's going up your penis.

105
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:13,598
Smaller and more malleable
does seem advantageous

106
00:06:13,682 --> 00:06:15,392
- in the world of penis tubes.
- See?

107
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,853
That already sounds better.

108
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,896
Well, we'll let you know.

109
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,107
And, hey, I always tell new friends,

110
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,568
I'm really into game nights,
if you ever host one.

111
00:07:11,156 --> 00:07:12,157
Hey. One, please.

112
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:30,759
<i>Bart, Dr. Andrews again.
Still haven't heard from you.</i>

113
00:07:30,842 --> 00:07:34,471
<i>I would really encourage you
to set an appointment soon.</i>

114
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,264
<i>It's really not a big thing.</i>

115
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,183
<i>It's just to assess how you're feeling</i>

116
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,810
<i>and make sure
the new dosage is working for you.</i>

117
00:07:40,894 --> 00:07:43,605
<i>So just call my office
and we will be here.</i>

118
00:08:21,977 --> 00:08:24,646
<i>And it was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.</i>

119
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,317
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

120
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:33,071
- Buddy.
- Hey, buddy.

121
00:08:34,489 --> 00:08:35,824
The movie's over.

122
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,954
The movie's over.

123
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,207
Oh, shit.

124
00:08:47,252 --> 00:08:48,086
Thanks.

125
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,264
Hey! Hey, bud.

126
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:04,102
- Your jacket.
- Oh, shit. Thanks.

127
00:09:04,186 --> 00:09:06,897
Yeah. You left it on your seat.

128
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,736
- I was drinking a little bit in there.
- Yeah, I saw that.

129
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:16,698
I'm batting a thousand here, aren't I?

130
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:19,659
It's okay. It seems like a pretty fun way
to spend an afternoon.

131
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:22,704
Yeah. I've had worse.
Thanks. Thanks again.

132
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,625
Hey.

133
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,337
Do you know where I could
maybe grab one of those around here?

134
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:33,548
- Oh, you mean go get a drink?
- Yeah.

135
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:36,051
There's two bars pretty close.

136
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,887
One is kind of a dive.

137
00:09:39,638 --> 00:09:41,264
The other is a little fancier.

138
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:45,060
It's one of those craft cocktail,
mixology-type places.

139
00:09:45,143 --> 00:09:46,520
Okay, cool. Let's go.

140
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,272
- I'm sorry. You want me to go?
- Yeah.

141
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:53,109
I don't really know the area.
I've just been wandering around by myself.

142
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:55,570
Honestly, I'm getting a little bored.

143
00:09:55,654 --> 00:09:59,032
You seem like you're
a relatively harmless human.

144
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,368
You don't murder people, do you?

145
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:03,578
No. Murder-free thus far.

146
00:10:03,662 --> 00:10:04,663
Cool.

147
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:07,874
So long as you keep that streak alive,

148
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,795
I think you should come
have a drink with me.

149
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:14,798
- Really?
- Really.

150
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:15,882
Come on.

151
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:19,761
All right. Fuck it. Let's drink, then.

152
00:10:19,844 --> 00:10:20,929
Lead the way.

153
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:22,597
Okay.

154
00:10:25,433 --> 00:10:28,436
- Hey, I'm Vienna.
- Hi. I'm Bart.

155
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,646
Nice to meet you.

156
00:10:30,939 --> 00:10:32,899
- Wait. Really?
- Yeah. It's a really good movie.

157
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:36,152
So it's one of your favorite films
and you've seen it over a hundred times

158
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,654
and you can't articulate why.

159
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,990
It's just a really good movie.

160
00:10:41,533 --> 00:10:42,367
I guess...

161
00:10:43,535 --> 00:10:46,872
I'm kind of an emotional person, I guess.

162
00:10:47,622 --> 00:10:48,748
Okay.

163
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:52,627
And a few years ago,
I happened to catch <i>Being There</i> on TV,

164
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:54,629
and I don't know why, but...

165
00:10:55,672 --> 00:11:00,051
Somehow, watching it on my couch that day,
something just clicked for me.

166
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:04,848
Life is gonna be sad and stressful
and tragic and devastating,

167
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,933
and that's just unavoidable, you know?

168
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:10,896
But that movie is like a reminder
that it's all a state of mind.

169
00:11:10,979 --> 00:11:14,900
We could make all that shit
as big or as little as we want.

170
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,237
I'm not saying
the movie cured me or anything,

171
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:23,033
but in that moment
it did make me feel a little better.

172
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:25,202
Well, that's something.

173
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:28,997
Did it do that today?

174
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:32,959
- Not really.
- Why not?

175
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:34,711
I don't know. Just didn't.

176
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,004
Doing okay, folks?

177
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:38,924
- Yes. We're good. Thanks.
- Yeah.

178
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:41,176
So, what brings you to town?

179
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,639
Like, where are you from
and what do you do

180
00:11:45,722 --> 00:11:46,723
and why are you here?

181
00:11:49,184 --> 00:11:52,604
Let's get out of here. Yeah?

182
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:54,356
Yeah?

183
00:11:54,439 --> 00:11:56,441
- Yeah.
- Take me to that dive bar.

184
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:57,901
Really?

185
00:11:57,984 --> 00:12:00,362
- Yeah. This is too fancy.
- All right, let's go.

186
00:12:00,445 --> 00:12:02,280
- I got the check.
- I can get it.

187
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,410
- Just...
- Jesus Christ.

188
00:12:07,494 --> 00:12:10,247
Are you going to the strip club later,
or did you just rob a bank?

189
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,083
No, no. I just have problems
with my bank card,

190
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,210
so I brought cash for my trip.

191
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:18,213
- Is 60 good?
- Sixty? That's way too much.

192
00:12:18,296 --> 00:12:21,049
It'll be like half that. Nice tip. Here.

193
00:12:21,883 --> 00:12:23,385
Okay. Cool.

194
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:26,513
L.A. prices,
I just thought it would be more.

195
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:28,723
Take me to this dive.

196
00:12:28,807 --> 00:12:30,100
- All right.
- Oh, wait.

197
00:12:31,393 --> 00:12:34,980
So is this funky bar of yours,
are they strict about carding?

198
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:37,315
'Cause I forgot my ID at home.

199
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:41,361
Well, you look way over 21,
so I think you'll be fine.

200
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:43,196
Cool, trying to be charming.

201
00:12:44,781 --> 00:12:46,950
You're a cute girl.

202
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,994
- You'll be fine.
- You think I'm cute?

203
00:12:49,828 --> 00:12:52,539
Well, yeah.
I mean, you look great for 50.

204
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,502
Oh, my God. Look at those!

205
00:12:58,211 --> 00:12:59,254
Sparklers?

206
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,048
Yeah, sparklers.

207
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:06,094
I didn't know they made those anymore.

208
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:08,763
You're kind of easily impressed,
aren't you?

209
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:11,975
I... I've just never done
a sparkler before.

210
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:13,977
I'm sorry, what?

211
00:13:14,686 --> 00:13:16,688
- Yep.
- You've never played with a sparkler?

212
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:17,606
Nope.

213
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:21,151
- Did you have a childhood?
- Yes, I did.

214
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:24,487
I just didn't play with sparklers,
I guess.

215
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:26,990
Okay, hold on.

216
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:29,367
- What? Okay.
- One second.

217
00:13:32,454 --> 00:13:37,834
Could I...? Could I buy two sparklers
from you for one whole dollar?

218
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:40,587
- Okay.
- All right. Thanks!

219
00:13:44,382 --> 00:13:46,092
What?

220
00:13:46,176 --> 00:13:48,970
- How'd you do that?
- I gave him a dollar.

221
00:13:49,054 --> 00:13:52,057
- To a kid, that's like a million bucks.
- You didn't have to do that.

222
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:53,725
I did have to do that

223
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:56,811
because you've never played
with a sparkler and that's just weird.

224
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:58,688
I don't wanna hang out with a weirdo.

225
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:02,484
- So I did it for selfish reasons, really.
- Okay.

226
00:14:03,151 --> 00:14:06,404
- Okay, fine.
- Okay. All right. Here goes...

227
00:14:07,072 --> 00:14:09,324
- What little crooks.
- This is really anticlimactic!

228
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:12,035
- Kind of hurts your hand.
- You gotta run with it.

229
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,454
- Run. Yeah.
- No, I'm not running alone!

230
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,332
This is not some solo show, bro.

231
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,876
You've gotta run with me. Come on!

232
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:45,610
If you want mediocrity in impressions

233
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:47,529
or just in life in general,

234
00:14:48,113 --> 00:14:49,865
- you've come to the right guy.
- Pacino.

235
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,078
Funny. Funny guy.

236
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:57,998
So scary. Jimmy Stewart.

237
00:14:58,957 --> 00:15:00,041
Jimmy Stewart.

238
00:15:00,876 --> 00:15:03,795
I don't have your money, Mr. Potter.

239
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:05,922
I don't know where your money is.

240
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:09,259
- These are legitimately good.
- Hold on one second.

241
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,761
Wait. What are you doing?

242
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:15,307
- The dive only takes cash.
- Yeah, but I've got cash.

243
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,518
I know you have cash.
You have like all of the cash.

244
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:22,731
But I can't let you buy drinks all night.
I gotta pull my weight a little bit.

245
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:24,900
And now I've got your passcode.

246
00:15:24,983 --> 00:15:27,235
Hey, ho.

247
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:29,154
Hey, ho.

248
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:33,158
Is that what you do?
It's how you got all that cash?

249
00:15:33,241 --> 00:15:36,995
You just sidle up
to handsome dudes and charm them

250
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:40,040
till they let their guard down at an ATM?

251
00:15:40,123 --> 00:15:43,501
And now I'm going to take you
for everything you're worth.

252
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:46,880
Well, you done picked
the wrong mark, buddy.

253
00:15:46,963 --> 00:15:48,465
Because I got...

254
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,469
324 bucks in there.

255
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,471
- Feel free to rob me blind.
- Oh, my God.

256
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,514
- You're not kidding.
- I'm not kidding.

257
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:58,600
- I'm gonna do it.
- Take it. Really.

258
00:15:58,683 --> 00:16:00,644
It won't matter. It really won't.

259
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:04,689
- Ma'am, would you like my bank passcode?
- Did you just call me "ma'am"?

260
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,610
Yes, I did. That's my bad. Apologies.

261
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:10,695
- So sorry. He's drunk.
- Have a nice night.

262
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:11,655
Cute dog.

263
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,203
So it was like a hopeful look at humanity?

264
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:19,829
- How novel.
- Oh, yeah.

265
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:22,207
It was a novel idea for a novel.

266
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,502
Not novel enough
for anyone to publish it...

267
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,547
- Yeah, well, they're dummies.
- Yeah, maybe not.

268
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,967
And how'd you come up
with this novel idea?

269
00:16:34,469 --> 00:16:36,179
I don't know. I think...

270
00:16:36,888 --> 00:16:39,558
actually, mostly 'cause my mom died.

271
00:16:40,892 --> 00:16:42,435
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

272
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,815
- I'm pretty sure it wasn't your fault.
- Yeah, well, you don't know me.

273
00:16:47,524 --> 00:16:49,484
You don't know what I'm capable of.

274
00:16:49,568 --> 00:16:52,195
Are you the one wandering around,
giving everyone cancer?

275
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,447
Yes. That's me.

276
00:16:54,531 --> 00:16:56,449
- That's you?
- I am Cancer Girl.

277
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,912
Crazy. You're a real bad person.

278
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,252
So how long ago did she pass?

279
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:11,256
Like a year ago.

280
00:17:17,512 --> 00:17:19,639
As soon as the doctor told her
that she had...

281
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,475
a year or so to live...

282
00:17:23,517 --> 00:17:26,730
she became almost instantly happier.

283
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,858
- What?
- Yeah.

284
00:17:30,859 --> 00:17:32,485
Wait, how is that possible?

285
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:37,657
I think it's like, as soon as she realized
that she had this limited amount of time,

286
00:17:37,741 --> 00:17:39,242
she just kind of relaxed.

287
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,995
And all the things
that she was worried about in her life...

288
00:17:42,078 --> 00:17:45,290
Like, what was she gonna do
about retirement?

289
00:17:45,373 --> 00:17:50,128
Would she have to sell her house?
Was her relationship going anywhere?

290
00:17:50,212 --> 00:17:55,175
All that stuff just didn't matter anymore.
It was kind of suddenly inconsequential.

291
00:17:56,259 --> 00:18:00,680
The only thing that mattered was
just her happiness in that moment

292
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:02,432
and what was right in front of her.

293
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,936
And just, like, being alive
while she could, you know?

294
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:10,190
Anyway, that's where the...

295
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,652
That's where the idea
for the novel first came from.

296
00:18:19,741 --> 00:18:22,202
- Do you wanna do shots?
- Yeah.

297
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,832
- How about that one?
- Oh, F yeah.

298
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:31,962
I'd totally dance to that shit.
What is that? H-1-4.

299
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:33,421
What?

300
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,549
- Nothing.
- What?

301
00:18:35,632 --> 00:18:38,385
Nothing. I'm just like, are you real?

302
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:40,470
Or are you like one of those...

303
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:44,391
What do you call them?
Manic Pixie Dream Girls.

304
00:18:44,474 --> 00:18:46,810
What, you think I'm here to save you?

305
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,105
I'm just saying, beautiful strangers
don't usually just walk up to me

306
00:18:50,188 --> 00:18:51,815
and ask me to go out for drinks

307
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:54,484
- and have a great time.
- I don't know anyone in town.

308
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,071
So, you know, I'd be happy
to find another tour guide.

309
00:18:58,154 --> 00:19:02,158
I'm sure any one of these barflies
would love to show me around.

310
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,786
Hey, Slim, do you like Peter Sellers?

311
00:19:05,662 --> 00:19:07,873
We're okay. No, listen. I'm...

312
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,042
Don't get me wrong, okay?
I'm glad you did.

313
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:13,628
Good! 'Cause that theory's dumb.

314
00:19:14,963 --> 00:19:16,756
All right, all right, all right.

315
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,551
Also, I could have ulterior motives.

316
00:19:20,719 --> 00:19:24,347
- I could totally be using you right now.
- Really? For what?

317
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:28,476
Quarters, motherfucker. Hand them over.

318
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:32,731
It's all I got.

319
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,112
Okay, 2-1-2...

320
00:19:40,697 --> 00:19:43,450
My fiancée left me
after I had some emotional problems,

321
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,535
and now I'm broke
and have to take a crap job

322
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,372
and move into my best friend's garage,
and my life is in total shambles.

323
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

324
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:56,796
That's why I went to the movie today.

325
00:19:59,841 --> 00:20:00,759
Well, then...

326
00:20:03,345 --> 00:20:05,972
I, for one, am really glad you did.

327
00:20:07,057 --> 00:20:07,933
Me too.

328
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:10,810
Oh, shit.

329
00:20:12,562 --> 00:20:14,189
- Okay.
- What's our motivation?

330
00:20:14,272 --> 00:20:15,857
Frowny faces or, like, sexy...?

331
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:18,777
I think we're winging it. Here it comes.

332
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,696
- That's too fast.
- They're coming really fast.

333
00:20:24,741 --> 00:20:25,867
What do we do?

334
00:20:35,168 --> 00:20:37,629
Do it. I won't judge.

335
00:20:37,712 --> 00:20:39,965
- Come on. Let it loose.
- This is your thing, not mine.

336
00:20:40,048 --> 00:20:42,634
I know, but I let myself loose,

337
00:20:42,717 --> 00:20:46,638
naked, vulnerable for you, so please,
just give it to me once, real fast.

338
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,598
You talking to me?

339
00:20:50,392 --> 00:20:51,852
Are you talking to me?

340
00:20:53,311 --> 00:20:55,981
That is really bad.

341
00:20:56,064 --> 00:20:59,860
- That is... It's like...
- I told you it's bad.

342
00:20:59,943 --> 00:21:04,072
It's like you're De Niro
but as a slow Saint Bernard.

343
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:09,494
It's like you're the taxi driver
who had a stroke...

344
00:21:10,787 --> 00:21:14,291
- That's mean.
- ...and got in too many car accidents.

345
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:16,585
Okay, I will have you know,

346
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,171
I am very good at animal impressions.

347
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,340
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

348
00:21:22,424 --> 00:21:23,466
Lion. Go.

349
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,720
I wish I could, but this is me.

350
00:21:29,431 --> 00:21:30,265
Jesus.

351
00:21:32,142 --> 00:21:32,976
Okay.

352
00:21:35,061 --> 00:21:36,938
How do I do this? Do I take your number?

353
00:21:37,022 --> 00:21:39,316
- Is that proper etiquette?
- Yeah. Sounds about right.

354
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:41,318
It's just, I don't have a phone.

355
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:43,820
Seriously?

356
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:45,405
Seriously.

357
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:49,659
Okay. What's going on here?

358
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:54,039
So you're not from around here,
you don't have an ID,

359
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:57,042
you're balling around
with huge stacks of cash,

360
00:21:57,125 --> 00:21:58,501
and you don't have a phone?

361
00:21:58,585 --> 00:22:01,338
I mean, are you a hit man or something?

362
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,966
- Oh, no. You found out.
- Seriously. What's...?

363
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,929
- Oh, shit. Do it quickly.
- No, I just broke my phone.

364
00:22:10,347 --> 00:22:11,973
You have to give me your number.

365
00:22:14,851 --> 00:22:15,685
Deal.

366
00:22:20,899 --> 00:22:24,402
- Who are those slobs?
- I don't know. Who are those weirdos?

367
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,284
Cool.

368
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:33,745
I'll call you sometime.

369
00:22:33,828 --> 00:22:35,038
Yeah, please do.

370
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,209
- Bye.
- Bye.

371
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:50,095
- Good night.
- Okay, good night.

372
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:05,861
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You have to kiss her.

373
00:23:05,944 --> 00:23:07,988
In this situation, you have to kiss her.

374
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:10,031
How many fucking chances
do you get like that?

375
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,083
<i>Hi. Just a quick question.
Is now too soon?</i>

376
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:03,585
Good night, buddy.

377
00:24:06,254 --> 00:24:07,130
Night.

378
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:13,803
I met a girl.

379
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:16,306
I just watched
my son piss in his own mouth.

380
00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:18,767
You wanna come in?

381
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,143
- Sure.
- Cool.

382
00:24:20,227 --> 00:24:25,607
Yeah, man, she's pretty and funny
and smart and just awesome,

383
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:28,485
and I'm gonna see her again tonight.

384
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:30,278
Hell, yeah, man.
That's fucking awesome.

385
00:24:30,362 --> 00:24:31,655
Yeah, it is. It is.

386
00:24:32,489 --> 00:24:34,991
- She's a little weird, I guess.
- Weird how?

387
00:24:35,075 --> 00:24:39,788
Well, like, she was walking around
with this huge wad of cash all night.

388
00:24:39,871 --> 00:24:42,415
So is she rich?
That's not weird. That's tight.

389
00:24:42,499 --> 00:24:44,501
She also doesn't have a cell phone.

390
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:48,713
- She doesn't have a cell phone?
- Yeah, no phone.

391
00:24:48,797 --> 00:24:50,549
Okay, that is fucking weird.

392
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:53,134
- Is it?
- That is truly bizarre.

393
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:55,262
- Everyone has a cell phone.
- Not everyone.

394
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:57,681
- Who doesn't have a phone?
- I don't know.

395
00:24:58,181 --> 00:25:00,600
Members of the Mennonite community
don't have cell phones.

396
00:25:00,684 --> 00:25:02,727
- People in the Mennonite community?
- Yeah.

397
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:06,690
So she's walking around in a bonnet,
riding on a horse and buggy?

398
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:09,901
Is that what you're telling me?
She's not a fucking Mennonite. It's weird.

399
00:25:09,985 --> 00:25:11,778
- Even Teddy has a cell phone.
- Seriously?

400
00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:12,863
Yeah.

401
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:15,740
Yeah, but I guess I'm wondering,
should I be worried?

402
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:19,369
I don't know, man.
That's a little out of my jurisdiction.

403
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:21,288
Baby! Rachel!

404
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,541
Oh, my God.
Eve is sleeping, you dum-dum.

405
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:27,586
- Dum-dum, doo-doo head.
- Yeah. Good one, Teddy.

406
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:30,213
You go sit over there.
We're gonna make lunch.

407
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:31,423
Babe, we have a question.

408
00:25:31,506 --> 00:25:35,635
- Is it weird that the girl Bart met...
- Bart met a girl?

409
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,387
- I did.
- That is so awesome.

410
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:40,223
But is it weird
that she doesn't have a phone?

411
00:25:40,932 --> 00:25:43,351
- Doesn't have a cellular phone?
- Right.

412
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:45,979
Is she a fake hipster
who plays the ukulele

413
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,023
and wears a trash bag around like a dress?

414
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:50,233
- I'm too tired for that.
- No, she's not like that.

415
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:52,527
- She's a really normal, cool girl.
- Okay. Good.

416
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:54,237
Who just happens to not have a phone.

417
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,406
- Okay, it's still very weird.
- It's rubbing me.

418
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:57,657
It's rubbing me wrong.

419
00:25:57,741 --> 00:26:00,827
Everyone I know has a cell phone.
My grandma has a cell phone. She's deaf.

420
00:26:00,911 --> 00:26:03,163
"Should I be worried?"
is what I'm wondering.

421
00:26:03,246 --> 00:26:07,584
She's really pretty and really fun,
and I just want something good.

422
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:10,086
What's her deal?
Where is she from? What does she do?

423
00:26:11,296 --> 00:26:13,006
Not sure.

424
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:15,050
And I'm not sure.

425
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:17,385
So you have a very special connection.

426
00:26:17,469 --> 00:26:20,972
We had a connection. We did.
We didn't really talk about that stuff.

427
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,059
You didn't get into it because...?
Were you staring at her boobs

428
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:27,229
or whatever you guys do
when you think you're making a connection?

429
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:30,565
- What's wrong with staring at boobs?
- A lot. She's not an object.

430
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,067
This is a woman he's...

431
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,861
- He doesn't know where she's from.
- Fine. You're right.

432
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:37,572
Honestly, I'm just so glad
you're moving on

433
00:26:37,656 --> 00:26:41,076
because I really liked Whit,
but that was unhealthy.

434
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,036
- Amen. Damn right.
- Unhealthy.

435
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,247
- I'm just happy to see you smiling again.
- Yeah.

436
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:47,666
But mostly, I'm happy you got laid.

437
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:51,753
You got laid? Oh, this is fantastic.
I'm so happy for you.

438
00:26:51,836 --> 00:26:54,339
Hey, Teddy. Uncle Bart got laid.

439
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,884
<i>Uncle Bart got laid</i>

440
00:26:57,968 --> 00:26:59,970
<i>Uncle Bart got laid</i>

441
00:27:02,138 --> 00:27:04,266
<i>Uncle Bart got
Got laid</i>

442
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,121
<i>Hey, B, I'm sorry that I keep calling.</i>

443
00:27:26,204 --> 00:27:28,540
<i>I'm really trying
to give you space, I swear.</i>

444
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:30,417
<i>But I got another message
from your doctor.</i>

445
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,544
<i>I was starting to worry a little,</i>

446
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:35,422
<i>so, you know, give them or me a call.</i>

447
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:36,715
<i>Okay? I just...</i>

448
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,098
- Hi.
- Hi.

449
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:49,102
- You look great.
- Thank you. So do you.

450
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:50,187
Oh, thank you.

451
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,856
I was totally fishing
for that compliment, so...

452
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:55,609
I bet. There's always something with you.

453
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,445
- Hi.
- Hi.

454
00:28:00,822 --> 00:28:03,158
- Shall we?
- Yeah, let's.

455
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:09,998
You're not a Mennonite, are you?

456
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:11,541
What?

457
00:28:12,083 --> 00:28:12,918
Nothing.

458
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:30,310
It's pretty incredible.

459
00:28:32,354 --> 00:28:33,188
I'll say.

460
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:43,823
<i>What's Beethoven's favorite fruit?</i>

461
00:28:43,907 --> 00:28:46,243
I don't know.
What is Beethoven's favorite fruit?

462
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:50,622
<i>Ba-na-na-na
Ba-na-na-na</i>

463
00:28:52,457 --> 00:28:54,543
Oh, my God.
That is way too big of a laugh.

464
00:28:54,626 --> 00:28:57,712
- That is a stupid, old dad joke.
- It's really funny.

465
00:28:57,796 --> 00:28:59,256
You love the dad jokes.

466
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:04,469
I can't believe you've never heard that.
That's an old standby.

467
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,972
Well, it just slipped through the cracks.

468
00:29:09,724 --> 00:29:13,311
So tell me stuff. I feel like
I didn't really get the scoop last time.

469
00:29:13,395 --> 00:29:16,481
What do you do?
Where are you from? Why are you here?

470
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:17,399
Okay.

471
00:29:19,025 --> 00:29:19,860
Oh, man.

472
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:22,487
I work for this government agency,

473
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:26,408
and I am from up north.

474
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:30,036
Cool, cool. That's all super vague.

475
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,455
It's just really freaking boring.

476
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:35,876
Continue.

477
00:29:37,627 --> 00:29:41,298
I came to town to...
I don't know why I came to town.

478
00:29:41,381 --> 00:29:43,884
I came to town to, I guess, escape.

479
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:45,594
Escape what?

480
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:47,929
Everything.

481
00:29:48,597 --> 00:29:51,892
Work. Life. My mom.

482
00:29:52,475 --> 00:29:55,687
I take it you and your mom have
a stellar relationship?

483
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,022
Actually, we do.

484
00:29:57,814 --> 00:29:59,316
Yeah. She's just sick.

485
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:04,279
- Shit. Sorry.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

486
00:30:05,238 --> 00:30:06,781
It's my fault. Remember?

487
00:30:07,449 --> 00:30:11,494
- Cancer Girl.
- Fuck. Cancer Girl strikes again.

488
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:12,954
Yeah.

489
00:30:13,788 --> 00:30:15,207
Is it...? Is it bad?

490
00:30:15,957 --> 00:30:16,958
It's not good.

491
00:30:17,918 --> 00:30:19,961
But it's mostly just exhausting.

492
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:25,342
So I thought getting away
for a little bit might be good.

493
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:30,055
Look at us having so much in common,
with our cancer moms.

494
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:31,348
I know, right?

495
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,351
Yeah.

496
00:30:34,434 --> 00:30:39,481
I remember my mom talking about
what L.A. was like before I was born.

497
00:30:40,815 --> 00:30:43,485
And how she loved it so much.

498
00:30:43,568 --> 00:30:47,656
How it seemed so romantic
and full of opportunity.

499
00:30:48,406 --> 00:30:51,409
So... I just wanted to see it.

500
00:30:53,036 --> 00:30:54,496
It is awfully pretty.

501
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,874
Yeah.

502
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,669
And so different now.

503
00:31:03,255 --> 00:31:04,339
Different from what?

504
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:10,679
Just from like...
how I envisioned it, I guess.

505
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:15,851
- I got it.
- No, I got it.

506
00:31:15,934 --> 00:31:16,768
No, it's fine.

507
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,150
- Okay, what's going on here?
- I'm paying.

508
00:31:24,234 --> 00:31:26,444
But that's gotta be like $10,000.

509
00:31:26,528 --> 00:31:29,906
- I didn't wanna leave it in the hotel.
- Why do you even have it?

510
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:33,493
I'm sorry. You're vague with your answers,
you don't have a phone...

511
00:31:33,577 --> 00:31:35,203
I don't wanna beat a dead horse here,

512
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:37,622
but I'm legit
getting a little bit freaked out.

513
00:31:37,706 --> 00:31:39,833
- What's going on?
- It's complicated.

514
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:41,835
You have to do better than that.

515
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:46,047
I'm having a great time with you,
but I'm just getting back on my feet.

516
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:48,383
I can't handle any crazy shit.

517
00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:51,553
- Okay. Let's talk about it.
- I'm serious. I'll leave.

518
00:31:51,636 --> 00:31:53,430
I just don't wanna talk about it here.

519
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:55,974
Okay.

520
00:31:57,267 --> 00:31:58,393
Okay.

521
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,533
- I love hummingbirds.
- Yeah. They're great.

522
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:17,662
We're back in my apartment now,
away from the crowds of people, so...

523
00:32:19,331 --> 00:32:20,165
shoot.

524
00:32:26,796 --> 00:32:27,631
Well...

525
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:35,805
Oh, my God. Am I about to wake up
in a tub full of ice without a kidney?

526
00:32:35,889 --> 00:32:38,516
No. It's nothing like that.

527
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:39,976
It's just...

528
00:32:44,523 --> 00:32:46,858
Buddy, come on.
The suspense is killing me here.

529
00:32:46,942 --> 00:32:50,111
- Just tell me what's going on.
- It's just that...

530
00:32:50,195 --> 00:32:51,988
Just tell me. You're married.

531
00:32:52,072 --> 00:32:54,366
- No.
- You're on the run from the law.

532
00:32:54,449 --> 00:32:56,660
- No.
- You killed a man in Texas.

533
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:59,996
No, it's not...
It's not like that. It's that...

534
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,373
Just tell me what the deal is.

535
00:33:01,456 --> 00:33:04,459
- I mean, I'm here for you.
- I'm trying to tell you.

536
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:06,962
I'm from the future. I'm from the future!

537
00:33:12,384 --> 00:33:14,302
Okay. That makes total sense.

538
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:17,556
I am from...

539
00:33:22,644 --> 00:33:24,229
Oh, my God. You're crazy.

540
00:33:28,358 --> 00:33:29,693
Fuck, man.

541
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,821
Why couldn't you just have taken a kidney?

542
00:33:32,904 --> 00:33:36,616
I know it sounds crazy,
but I'm being serious.

543
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,161
Cool, cool, cool.
So you're like from the year 4000?

544
00:33:40,245 --> 00:33:42,330
- No, that's ridiculous.
- Agreed.

545
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:45,250
- I'm from 2052.
- Okay, time to go.

546
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,544
- I work for a division of the NSA.
- Good for you.

547
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:50,171
- That's a cool job.
- It is nice, actually.

548
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:52,257
I have dental and vision,
and that's something

549
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,634
because our health-care system
is really fucked.

550
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:56,678
Yeah. So is ours. Time to go now.

551
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:58,889
Would you please listen to me? Just...

552
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:02,851
Would you... hear me out?

553
00:34:04,686 --> 00:34:05,645
Please.

554
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,316
Fine.

555
00:34:12,527 --> 00:34:13,612
Okay.

556
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:20,035
No one really knows about our branch.
It's kind of a secret division.

557
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:25,332
We're a research lab supposedly studying
the transference of matter,

558
00:34:25,415 --> 00:34:28,500
but what we really do is
the study of space and time.

559
00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:33,589
A while ago, they figured out
how to actually transcend time.

560
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:37,219
So, since then,
we've been making changes to the past

561
00:34:37,302 --> 00:34:40,096
to slightly alter our present
for the better.

562
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,265
- Or that's the goal, at least.
- So what?

563
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:45,393
You go back and... kill Hitler,
that kind of thing?

564
00:34:45,477 --> 00:34:48,313
No, you can't do big things like that.
It's more like...

565
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:51,107
- <i>Back to the Future.</i>
- Oh, really?

566
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:53,151
You know the movie <i>Back to the Future?</i>

567
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:56,488
Yeah, it's a classic.
You know <i>Casablanca,</i> don't you?

568
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:59,366
- That makes sense but still...
- Look.

569
00:34:59,449 --> 00:35:02,035
You can't go back
and prohibit your parents from going

570
00:35:02,118 --> 00:35:06,248
to the Enchantment Under the Sea dance
or you might actually just disappear.

571
00:35:06,331 --> 00:35:10,210
But if you make small,
almost imperceptible shifts,

572
00:35:10,293 --> 00:35:13,672
you can change
your present slightly for the better.

573
00:35:13,755 --> 00:35:15,090
Okay, like what?

574
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:18,426
Like the fact that anyone gives even
a bit of a shit about climate change?

575
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:21,429
- That is us.
- So, what are you here to do?

576
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:24,391
Am I super important
in the future or something?

577
00:35:24,474 --> 00:35:26,393
Oh, my God. Someone's got an inflated ego.

578
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:28,770
Believe me, I don't.
That's a thing from <i>Bill and Ted's.</i>

579
00:35:28,854 --> 00:35:31,773
- Who are Bill and Ted?
- Oh, so that's not a classic?

580
00:35:31,857 --> 00:35:34,359
Look, I am not even here for that.

581
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:39,322
I'm not technically even supposed
to be allowed to jump, but...

582
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:46,872
My mom is really...

583
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:52,168
She really is sick.

584
00:35:55,297 --> 00:35:58,592
And she's broke,
and I don't have the money to help her.

585
00:36:01,553 --> 00:36:03,096
So the idea was to...

586
00:36:04,723 --> 00:36:08,727
buy a few stocks,
put them in a safety-deposit box,

587
00:36:09,352 --> 00:36:13,315
and they'd be worth enough
to help her when I get back.

588
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:17,360
And I didn't tell anybody about this,
and it was supposed to be quick,

589
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:21,656
and I didn't expect to meet someone,
and then I did, and you're...

590
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:25,493
great.

591
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,999
And now I don't know what to do.

592
00:36:36,671 --> 00:36:37,923
Oh, my God.

593
00:36:40,175 --> 00:36:41,259
This is just...

594
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,513
This is... Fuck.

595
00:36:46,389 --> 00:36:49,684
I... I'm sorry. Do you want me to go?

596
00:36:50,477 --> 00:36:51,436
Yes.

597
00:36:53,522 --> 00:36:54,481
No.

598
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:59,986
I don't know. This is just...
It's a lot, you know?

599
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:00,946
Yeah.

600
00:37:24,594 --> 00:37:29,516
This is from one of my favorite bands,
and they're called Long Weekend.

601
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,602
And the song came out
when I was in college

602
00:37:32,686 --> 00:37:35,647
and I just always sort of loved it.

603
00:37:37,357 --> 00:37:38,233
So...

604
00:37:43,905 --> 00:37:47,075
<i>Stars in flight</i>

605
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:51,538
<i>Forever tonight</i>

606
00:37:52,372 --> 00:37:54,040
<i>Forever tonight</i>

607
00:37:56,877 --> 00:37:59,796
<i>Shine so bright</i>

608
00:38:01,047 --> 00:38:03,967
<i>Forever tonight</i>

609
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:06,511
<i>Forever tonight</i>

610
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:12,392
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

611
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:16,229
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

612
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:18,607
<i>That nothing lasts forever</i>

613
00:38:19,983 --> 00:38:22,986
<i>Nothing lasts forever</i>

614
00:38:23,612 --> 00:38:27,324
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

615
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:30,952
<i>Tell me how you know
How you know, how you know</i>

616
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:33,330
<i>That it's too late</i>

617
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:41,129
<i>Because my heart won't wait forever</i>

618
00:38:43,173 --> 00:38:48,094
<i>Constellations above me</i>

619
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,139
<i>Where did you go?</i>

620
00:38:52,515 --> 00:38:55,644
<i>Where did you go?</i>

621
00:38:57,395 --> 00:39:02,609
<i>Hold on if you still love me</i>

622
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:05,779
<i>How will I know?</i>

623
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:09,866
<i>How will I know?</i>

624
00:39:10,575 --> 00:39:13,078
<i>So tell me how you know
How you...</i>

625
00:39:37,352 --> 00:39:38,728
Hello.

626
00:39:40,897 --> 00:39:41,731
Hey.

627
00:39:57,163 --> 00:39:59,332
So listen...

628
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:04,170
I really like you...

629
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:11,177
but I can only stay here
for a little bit before I have to...

630
00:40:12,429 --> 00:40:13,471
get back.

631
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:18,727
So can we just...

632
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:21,188
maybe enjoy this?

633
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:24,649
- Just enjoy this?
- Yeah.

634
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:29,738
Okay.

635
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,323
Great.

636
00:40:36,912 --> 00:40:39,414
So now that we got that out of the way...

637
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:44,085
I need your help with something first.

638
00:40:46,296 --> 00:40:49,424
- So why this place?
- 'Cause it's not going anywhere.

639
00:40:50,133 --> 00:40:53,053
- Just the one safety-deposit box?
- That's right.

640
00:40:53,136 --> 00:40:55,555
- Yes, please.
- And will it be in your name?

641
00:40:55,639 --> 00:41:00,185
In my name, but I'd like to make sure
that she has access to the box as well.

642
00:41:00,268 --> 00:41:03,146
- Of course. I'll just need your license.
- Sure.

643
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:11,821
Okay. Now if you could
just fill this out right here.

644
00:41:26,836 --> 00:41:28,630
All right. And this is yours.

645
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:31,466
I'll leave you to it.

646
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:33,885
Thank you so much.

647
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:40,892
Well?

648
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:42,310
Right.

649
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:52,696
Hyundai?

650
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:54,990
Really?

651
00:41:55,073 --> 00:41:56,074
Oh, yeah.

652
00:42:01,538 --> 00:42:02,372
So...

653
00:42:04,165 --> 00:42:05,333
you did have...

654
00:42:06,418 --> 00:42:08,128
ulterior motives here.

655
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:14,968
Kind of. Yes, it's true.
I had to find somebody with an ID.

656
00:42:15,051 --> 00:42:18,346
Okay, so I'm just somebody
with an ID to you?

657
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:21,391
No, of course not.
I could have found anyone.

658
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,520
There's a reason I came to you.

659
00:42:25,604 --> 00:42:27,397
I was drunk and sleepy?

660
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:31,693
Exactly. You were a very easy target.

661
00:42:34,112 --> 00:42:36,072
But, really, why me?

662
00:42:36,156 --> 00:42:37,616
Oh, buddy.

663
00:42:38,491 --> 00:42:39,492
There are...

664
00:42:40,452 --> 00:42:42,454
a lot of reasons, okay?

665
00:42:44,247 --> 00:42:48,376
But just know
that I was drawn to you and I still am.

666
00:42:53,798 --> 00:42:55,425
Okay. I can live with that.

667
00:42:55,508 --> 00:42:56,760
- Okay?
- Yeah.

668
00:42:57,552 --> 00:42:59,387
- Okay.
- So what now?

669
00:43:00,764 --> 00:43:01,806
Well, we could...

670
00:43:02,474 --> 00:43:03,308
Sex?

671
00:43:04,226 --> 00:43:05,143
Okay.

672
00:43:09,689 --> 00:43:11,191
Oh, my God.

673
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:14,027
<i>Okay.</i>

674
00:43:15,695 --> 00:43:18,532
I would like to see... a bear.

675
00:43:27,499 --> 00:43:29,918
This bear is a terrible kisser.

676
00:43:30,752 --> 00:43:34,172
Keep going.
Keep your eyes closed. Eyes closed.

677
00:43:34,256 --> 00:43:35,465
And stop.

678
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,009
Now come to me.

679
00:43:39,594 --> 00:43:40,804
I know you're close.

680
00:43:40,887 --> 00:43:42,931
- A snake.
- A snake.

681
00:43:43,014 --> 00:43:46,017
- How do I do a snake?
- That's kind of a you problem.

682
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:47,644
That's how it is, huh?

683
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:53,984
- That's not a snake.
- That's for sure a snake.

684
00:43:54,067 --> 00:43:55,610
- Push, push, push.
- I am.

685
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:56,695
Hard. Hard.

686
00:43:56,778 --> 00:43:59,239
Three, two... Okay, step out.

687
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:00,866
Just let your arms go.

688
00:44:04,452 --> 00:44:06,538
Don't you have door frames in the future?

689
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:09,624
Yeah, but this is gonna blow
their fucking minds.

690
00:44:09,708 --> 00:44:12,002
And stop.

691
00:44:12,085 --> 00:44:12,961
Oh, shit.

692
00:44:13,837 --> 00:44:15,088
What's that thing?

693
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:18,383
This is a rattlesnake, and it is its tail.

694
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:27,809
I can see.

695
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:34,399
Oh, God! Jesus.

696
00:44:50,582 --> 00:44:52,792
So how long do you have?

697
00:44:56,838 --> 00:44:58,089
Just a little bit.

698
00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:00,425
Not long enough.

699
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:09,726
It's just, you know,
it gets tricky if you stay too long.

700
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:12,062
Right.

701
00:45:15,815 --> 00:45:17,943
The fucking future?

702
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:19,319
Yeah, 2052.

703
00:45:19,402 --> 00:45:22,197
- We have time travel in 2052?
- Not all of us.

704
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,408
She works for a secret branch
of the NSA or something.

705
00:45:25,492 --> 00:45:27,869
That "or something"
is that this chick is crazy.

706
00:45:27,953 --> 00:45:30,580
I thought so too, but then she...

707
00:45:31,957 --> 00:45:35,377
- She kind of convinced me.
- How? How?

708
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,420
She sang this song from her favorite band.

709
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:39,214
And?

710
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:41,800
And it was a song
I had never heard before.

711
00:45:42,801 --> 00:45:46,513
That's it? She didn't even try the whole
"Future Biff convincing Past Biff

712
00:45:46,596 --> 00:45:48,682
he was real by telling him
the outcome of a game"?

713
00:45:48,765 --> 00:45:51,852
No, I thought she would,
but it was mostly just a song.

714
00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:53,687
Do you understand how easy it is
to come up with a song?

715
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:57,482
- It's that not easy.
- It is so easy. I will do it right now.

716
00:45:57,566 --> 00:45:59,901
<i>I got my flip-flop
I got my tip-top</i>

717
00:45:59,985 --> 00:46:02,737
<i>I got my...
Summer love</i>

718
00:46:03,363 --> 00:46:05,907
Now I'm from the fucking future.
Worship me.

719
00:46:06,491 --> 00:46:09,828
- It was better than that.
- That was pretty good, right?

720
00:46:09,911 --> 00:46:13,123
- Wasn't bad.
- Dude, come on. Flip-flops, summer love?

721
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:15,166
That was off the top of my dome.

722
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:17,377
- I know. I understand.
- It was catchy.

723
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,337
Like "I might have missed
my calling" catchy.

724
00:46:19,421 --> 00:46:21,131
It was more than just a song, all right?

725
00:46:21,214 --> 00:46:25,468
She was also just really specific
and really normal and really sane.

726
00:46:25,552 --> 00:46:28,513
And I can't explain why,

727
00:46:28,597 --> 00:46:30,974
but I really do believe her.

728
00:46:32,017 --> 00:46:32,934
I mean...

729
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:35,937
it could be true.

730
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:40,609
Dude, no one is happier than me
that you're getting your beak wet, okay?

731
00:46:40,692 --> 00:46:44,279
- I am thrilled. With all that Whit stuff...
- Don't bring that up.

732
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:47,407
After all the Whit stuff
and the treatment...

733
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,659
- It's not that. I'm fine.
- ...and all of that...

734
00:46:49,743 --> 00:46:51,620
I know you are.
I'm just saying that maybe

735
00:46:51,703 --> 00:46:53,997
this isn't the right thing
for you to get involved in.

736
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:59,544
Maybe you need something
a little more stable, you know?

737
00:47:01,296 --> 00:47:02,130
Timmy Emerson.

738
00:47:03,006 --> 00:47:05,550
Normal response. What about him?

739
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:07,427
- Do you remember him?
- Yes, I remember him.

740
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,638
He was a cancer kid from school.
Who cares?

741
00:47:09,721 --> 00:47:12,390
In fourth grade, he was diagnosed
with stage 4 leukemia.

742
00:47:12,474 --> 00:47:15,810
I know. His Make-A-Wish was
to go to a live taping of <i>Full House.</i>

743
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:17,103
I was super jealous of that.

744
00:47:17,187 --> 00:47:20,440
That fall, the doctors told his parents
treatments weren't working.

745
00:47:20,524 --> 00:47:23,735
He wouldn't live past Christmas.
Christmas came. Timmy was still here.

746
00:47:23,818 --> 00:47:26,905
And then it was spring.
Timmy was still around. He seemed fine.

747
00:47:26,988 --> 00:47:29,699
And then his parents took him
for a checkup

748
00:47:29,783 --> 00:47:32,118
and the cancer was just gone, you know?

749
00:47:32,202 --> 00:47:34,996
- I mean, that's fucking crazy.
- Yeah.

750
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:37,707
If that's a thing
that happened in the world,

751
00:47:37,791 --> 00:47:39,751
then why can't she be from the future?

752
00:47:40,377 --> 00:47:43,838
Because those are
two completely different things.

753
00:47:43,922 --> 00:47:48,426
But it's not though. It's inexplicable,
but it still happened, you know?

754
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:51,429
It's a crazy fucking thing,
and it still happened.

755
00:47:51,513 --> 00:47:54,307
I mean, it's possible, is all I'm saying.

756
00:47:55,767 --> 00:47:56,601
Yeah.

757
00:47:57,978 --> 00:48:00,397
- You know, it happened.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

758
00:48:02,023 --> 00:48:03,817
Okay, buddy. Look.

759
00:48:06,027 --> 00:48:07,028
I get it.

760
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:09,030
I do.

761
00:48:09,573 --> 00:48:12,534
I know it's hard to recognize

762
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:15,370
when someone you care about is sick.

763
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:18,748
- I saw it with you.
- Oh, my God. This isn't that.

764
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:21,918
I know, this is different. I get it. Okay?

765
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:26,089
But it seems like something's going on
with this girl, right?

766
00:48:26,172 --> 00:48:28,592
And I know it's scary
when you see someone

767
00:48:28,675 --> 00:48:30,844
that you know really well start
to come unglued.

768
00:48:30,927 --> 00:48:33,430
She isn't me, okay?
This is very different.

769
00:48:33,513 --> 00:48:36,975
Yes. Can you just sit down?

770
00:48:37,058 --> 00:48:38,518
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

771
00:48:38,602 --> 00:48:40,145
- Don't treat me like that.
- I'm...

772
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:42,772
I just don't wanna see you
take steps backwards.

773
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:45,734
- I don't want your fucking help, Doug.
- Barty.

774
00:48:46,943 --> 00:48:47,777
Bart...

775
00:48:56,077 --> 00:48:57,829
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Okay.

776
00:48:57,913 --> 00:49:00,332
Just keep in mind
I haven't done this in a while.

777
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,043
- Understood. No judgment.
- Okay.

778
00:49:03,126 --> 00:49:04,169
- Ready?
- Yep.

779
00:49:05,795 --> 00:49:06,630
Hit it.

780
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,066
Okay.

781
00:50:10,527 --> 00:50:11,403
That's it.

782
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:14,573
- Bravo!
- Thank you.

783
00:50:14,656 --> 00:50:17,075
- Encore!
- Okay. No.

784
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:20,245
That was really something.

785
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:22,247
Okay, it is your turn.

786
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,749
No, I can't compete with that.

787
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,919
- I was never in a dance recital.
- Well, too bad.

788
00:50:28,003 --> 00:50:30,672
You're gonna have to figure out
something to show me.

789
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:35,260
Yeah, this way.

790
00:50:39,681 --> 00:50:42,893
Okay, so when I was having my problems,

791
00:50:42,976 --> 00:50:46,438
my doctor said it would be good
to have a physical outlet of some kind,

792
00:50:46,521 --> 00:50:48,064
so I started doing this.

793
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:50,192
Is this an exercise class or something?

794
00:50:50,275 --> 00:50:52,068
- No.
- What is it?

795
00:50:52,736 --> 00:50:53,570
You'll see.

796
00:51:00,368 --> 00:51:01,244
What?

797
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:06,917
It's dancing in the dark.

798
00:51:07,918 --> 00:51:11,421
Don't think about anything.
Just dance and sweat and...

799
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:13,298
go crazy.

800
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,595
<i>If you're really from the future,
you'll have to give me some specifics.</i>

801
00:52:00,679 --> 00:52:03,682
<i>Like... are we all doomed?</i>

802
00:52:03,765 --> 00:52:06,476
<i>Does George Martin
ever finish those books?</i>

803
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:09,771
<i>Do the Pirates win the World Series? Ever?</i>

804
00:52:11,022 --> 00:52:14,776
<i>I don't know offhand.
I'm not a sports almanac.</i>

805
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:17,112
<i>Then I don't know
if I believe you. How about that?</i>

806
00:52:17,195 --> 00:52:19,656
<i>Oh, really? Seriously?</i>

807
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:22,742
<i>Yeah, you tell me you've unlocked
the secrets of time travel,</i>

808
00:52:22,826 --> 00:52:25,704
<i>but all I have to go off
is a song you sang me</i>

809
00:52:25,787 --> 00:52:27,998
<i>and your wildly charming disposition.</i>

810
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:32,627
<i>Look, it isn't a good idea for me
to get into specifics.</i>

811
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:35,005
<i>But I can tell you</i>

812
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:39,217
<i>that someone as pale as you
is definitely the minority now.</i>

813
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:43,805
<i>Otherwise, I don't know.
I guess it's not that different.</i>

814
00:52:43,889 --> 00:52:46,182
<i>It's hotter and drier in some places.</i>

815
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,353
<i>Colder and wetter in others.
There are more extremes.</i>

816
00:52:52,856 --> 00:52:55,233
<i>There's still conflict and wars,</i>

817
00:52:55,317 --> 00:52:58,111
<i>and most think it's worse
than it's ever been,</i>

818
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,906
<i>but I'm not sure it's so different.</i>

819
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:06,411
<i>'Cause at the end of the day,
people still want the same things.</i>

820
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:10,790
<i>Still wanna have good jobs,
go on vacation, see the world,</i>

821
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:14,920
<i>get drunk, get married, get a dog,</i>

822
00:53:15,003 --> 00:53:17,339
<i>buy a house, have some kids.</i>

823
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:21,551
<i>We all still wanna feel valued and happy</i>

824
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:26,473
<i>but are confused when we get
all the things we want but still don't.</i>

825
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:31,228
<i>I guess we're all still messy
and flawed and confused</i>

826
00:53:31,311 --> 00:53:33,730
<i>but just trying to do the best we can.</i>

827
00:53:34,439 --> 00:53:37,108
<i>Just trying to find love.</i>

828
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:44,616
Does that make sense?

829
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:47,410
I think so.

830
00:53:51,331 --> 00:53:55,961
You're not gonna give me a little hint
about the Pirates in the World Series?

831
00:53:56,044 --> 00:53:58,421
Oh, my God, give it up.

832
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:00,257
That'd be too much.

833
00:54:01,091 --> 00:54:04,553
But I will tell you about this one time
when I was a little girl,

834
00:54:05,637 --> 00:54:07,889
maybe 6 or something,

835
00:54:07,973 --> 00:54:10,267
there was this huge meteor shower.

836
00:54:11,142 --> 00:54:15,313
And it was the biggest one in over
like a thousand years or something,

837
00:54:15,397 --> 00:54:18,024
and my dad really wanted
to watch it with me.

838
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:22,487
So we drove out
to a desert like this one...

839
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,909
because he loved the desert
when he was alive.

840
00:54:33,081 --> 00:54:34,875
I guess he's alive right now.

841
00:54:42,924 --> 00:54:45,635
So we packed up these snacks...

842
00:54:47,429 --> 00:54:48,930
and hot chocolate,

843
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:53,768
and we drove to the desert
and sat on a hill like this one.

844
00:54:55,645 --> 00:54:59,774
And the showers weren't supposed
to start till the middle of the night.

845
00:55:01,276 --> 00:55:05,363
So I felt super cool 'cause I got
to stay up late and drink hot cocoa.

846
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:11,995
But then, eventually, I fell asleep
on his shoulder and he woke me up.

847
00:55:13,121 --> 00:55:17,083
He nudged me a little
and he said, "Hey, sweet pea, look up."

848
00:55:18,877 --> 00:55:20,420
And above us was...

849
00:55:22,422 --> 00:55:24,633
just a brilliant sight.

850
00:55:25,425 --> 00:55:30,180
Thousands of meteors
streaking through the sky,

851
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:35,268
white and purple, blues, green...

852
00:55:36,603 --> 00:55:40,148
It was like the sky had just exploded

853
00:55:40,232 --> 00:55:44,027
into this amazing celestial dance.

854
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:52,452
And it was just the most beautiful sight
I've ever seen.

855
00:55:56,915 --> 00:55:58,708
Can you imagine such a thing?

856
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:03,964
I can.

857
00:56:09,761 --> 00:56:12,138
So don't miss it. Okay?

858
00:56:15,517 --> 00:56:16,434
Okay.

859
00:56:58,894 --> 00:56:59,769
Hello?

860
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:27,756
Vienna?

861
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:42,812
There you are.

862
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,576
Hey. Buddy.

863
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:04,251
You okay?

864
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:09,923
Yeah. Morning.

865
00:58:10,632 --> 00:58:11,550
Morning.

866
00:58:13,426 --> 00:58:15,220
- Hi.
- Hi.

867
00:58:16,596 --> 00:58:17,806
Yeah, I'm good.

868
00:58:18,682 --> 00:58:21,268
Do you wanna hit the road?

869
00:58:21,351 --> 00:58:22,686
Maybe get some coffee?

870
00:58:24,187 --> 00:58:25,230
Yeah, sure.

871
00:58:26,648 --> 00:58:27,732
Okay.

872
00:58:52,257 --> 00:58:53,300
Home sweet home.

873
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:55,468
Yeah.

874
00:59:10,942 --> 00:59:11,818
Hey.

875
00:59:13,945 --> 00:59:14,863
You okay?

876
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:18,658
Yeah.

877
00:59:19,284 --> 00:59:20,160
I'm just...

878
00:59:21,244 --> 00:59:22,662
real tired.

879
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:38,595
Cannonball!

880
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:42,307
- Oh, Jesus.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Did I wake you?

881
00:59:43,058 --> 00:59:44,309
You might have.

882
00:59:45,018 --> 00:59:47,646
Good. Because we've got things
we have to do.

883
00:59:47,729 --> 00:59:49,439
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

884
00:59:49,523 --> 00:59:53,735
I made us a picnic and everything.
So let's go. Come on. Out, out, out.

885
00:59:53,818 --> 00:59:56,321
- Up, up, up. Go, go, go.
- Five minutes.

886
00:59:56,404 --> 00:59:57,447
Okay.

887
00:59:57,531 --> 01:00:01,785
Well, then I guess
I could always go for some... butthole.

888
01:00:01,868 --> 01:00:02,911
No!

889
01:00:02,994 --> 01:00:05,747
- I want that butt!
- Okay, okay, I'm up, I'm up.

890
01:00:06,873 --> 01:00:08,792
- A mouse.
- Oh, where?

891
01:00:08,875 --> 01:00:13,088
Yeah, you see the two ears
and then its little nose right there?

892
01:00:21,429 --> 01:00:23,932
You know, I'm okay, right?

893
01:00:26,518 --> 01:00:27,394
Okay.

894
01:00:28,395 --> 01:00:30,063
Like I'm not crazy.

895
01:00:30,856 --> 01:00:33,024
Unstable. You know, it's just...

896
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,152
It's just a thing that happens
when you travel.

897
01:00:37,571 --> 01:00:40,574
If you're out
of your own time for too long,

898
01:00:40,657 --> 01:00:46,121
your brain chemistry kind of shifts,
and then you can start feeling...

899
01:00:47,956 --> 01:00:49,082
untethered.

900
01:00:50,709 --> 01:00:52,711
That's why I can't stay long.

901
01:01:01,344 --> 01:01:02,929
Last fall, I...

902
01:01:04,347 --> 01:01:06,850
I became really anxious about...

903
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:10,061
everything.

904
01:01:10,812 --> 01:01:12,772
Like life in general, I guess.

905
01:01:13,523 --> 01:01:15,066
I mean, my mom died,

906
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:20,322
and things with Whit,
my ex, weren't great.

907
01:01:20,405 --> 01:01:24,826
And I wasn't getting any work,
and I, like, stopped sleeping,

908
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:28,288
and I stopped going out,
and I stopped, like,

909
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:30,457
wanting to do anything.

910
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:35,295
And at some point, I kind of lost touch
with what was real and what wasn't.

911
01:01:37,923 --> 01:01:38,840
You know?

912
01:01:41,843 --> 01:01:42,802
Yeah, I do.

913
01:01:45,889 --> 01:01:48,934
So that's when Doug stepped in
and made me get help.

914
01:01:49,893 --> 01:01:52,103
And at first I was so pissed at him.

915
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:57,567
But looking back, I really...

916
01:01:59,277 --> 01:02:00,862
I really needed it.

917
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:07,077
Just being a person is hard, huh?

918
01:02:20,590 --> 01:02:21,841
Hold on. Slow down.

919
01:02:32,185 --> 01:02:33,144
Yeah.

920
01:02:34,312 --> 01:02:35,730
That's good. What does that mean?

921
01:02:35,814 --> 01:02:38,817
It means, "I'm very sorry,
but I don't speak Italian very well."

922
01:02:39,484 --> 01:02:40,402
That's useful.

923
01:02:40,944 --> 01:02:42,946
- How do you know so much Italian?
- Oh, my God.

924
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:45,991
People got really into Italian
after Venice.

925
01:02:46,074 --> 01:02:47,492
What happened in Venice?

926
01:02:48,368 --> 01:02:49,953
What do you think happened in Venice?

927
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:53,957
What else you got?

928
01:03:02,382 --> 01:03:03,758
Translation?

929
01:03:03,842 --> 01:03:08,847
"I am a bad conversationalist
but a superb lover."

930
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:12,017
- Yeah.
- Use that one a lot, do you?

931
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,477
- You know, just some basics.
- Right.

932
01:03:15,312 --> 01:03:16,563
Does this need more salt?

933
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:24,154
Okay.

934
01:03:24,821 --> 01:03:28,033
- We just need more wine and we're good.
- It's in the other room. I'll get it.

935
01:03:28,909 --> 01:03:30,076
What is the phrase again?

936
01:03:42,672 --> 01:03:46,927
Vienna, help me. I'm stuck
in a loop with the <i>conversatore.</i>

937
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:49,262
We need to start with some basic phrases.

938
01:03:49,346 --> 01:03:53,516
Like, "Where's the bathroom?"
and "I'm lost" and "Thank you."

939
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,144
'Cause I'm kind of shitting
the bed on this.

940
01:03:58,313 --> 01:03:59,314
Hey, hey.

941
01:04:01,525 --> 01:04:02,943
Buddy, what's going on?

942
01:04:05,862 --> 01:04:06,780
I'm sorry.

943
01:04:07,364 --> 01:04:08,782
Hey, hey, hey.

944
01:04:08,865 --> 01:04:12,160
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'm sorry. I can't...

945
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:18,416
- I got you.
- I can't stop.

946
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:20,460
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

947
01:04:21,836 --> 01:04:25,340
- Take deep breaths.
- I've just stayed too long.

948
01:04:27,592 --> 01:04:30,053
I don't wanna go.

949
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:32,722
- It's okay. We'll figure it out.
- Okay.

950
01:04:32,806 --> 01:04:36,017
Take deep breaths. It's okay. I got you.

951
01:04:36,101 --> 01:04:38,353
I just don't know what to do

952
01:04:38,436 --> 01:04:41,606
because I love you.

953
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:45,318
I love you too.

954
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:49,823
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna figure it out. All right?

955
01:04:51,783 --> 01:04:54,160
It's okay. It's okay.

956
01:04:55,245 --> 01:04:56,997
You're okay. Okay.

957
01:04:59,708 --> 01:05:02,085
Hey. It's all right.

958
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:35,368
- <i>Hey, you all right?</i>
- Hey. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just...

959
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:42,792
I'm sorry for being a dick, man.
I'm really sorry.

960
01:05:42,876 --> 01:05:44,211
<i>Barty, it's okay, man.</i>

961
01:05:44,836 --> 01:05:47,088
I just... I don't know...

962
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:51,635
I don't know what to do, Doug.

963
01:05:53,929 --> 01:05:55,388
Just tell me what to do.

964
01:05:56,890 --> 01:06:00,310
<i>I don't know, man.
I mean, if you really like this girl...</i>

965
01:06:00,393 --> 01:06:02,604
I do. I do so much.

966
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:03,647
<i>Well, then...</i>

967
01:06:04,439 --> 01:06:05,315
<i>help her.</i>

968
01:06:06,983 --> 01:06:08,318
<i>You know better than anyone.</i>

969
01:06:08,401 --> 01:06:11,238
<i>Sometimes we've gotta step in
and help the people we love.</i>

970
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:19,037
Yeah, you're right.

971
01:06:20,705 --> 01:06:21,706
Good advice.

972
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:26,211
Thanks, Doug.

973
01:06:27,629 --> 01:06:30,757
<i>I'm here, man.
Just call if you need anything, okay?</i>

974
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:35,971
Will do. You're the best.

975
01:07:29,941 --> 01:07:32,652
Perfect. Thanks for fitting us in.

976
01:07:35,697 --> 01:07:37,115
Yeah, that's correct.

977
01:07:43,663 --> 01:07:46,124
- Morning.
- Morning.

978
01:07:53,590 --> 01:07:55,091
I have something for us to do.

979
01:07:58,011 --> 01:07:58,845
Okay.

980
01:08:08,271 --> 01:08:10,982
It's such a pretty day, isn't it?

981
01:08:13,276 --> 01:08:15,445
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's really pretty.

982
01:08:43,138 --> 01:08:44,932
You don't believe me, do you?

983
01:08:49,062 --> 01:08:53,984
I don't know.
I want to and I'm trying to...

984
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:57,445
but I don't know if I can.

985
01:09:01,615 --> 01:09:03,034
Either way, I...

986
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:06,620
I don't wanna lose you.

987
01:09:10,834 --> 01:09:13,794
And the people inside, they can help.

988
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:17,090
They helped me last fall when I...

989
01:09:19,383 --> 01:09:20,677
came untethered.

990
01:09:34,065 --> 01:09:37,235
<i>Dr. Wallace, dial 118, please.</i>

991
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:40,238
<i>Dr. Wallace, please dial 1-1-8.</i>

992
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:49,581
Just talk to the doctor and then we can
go get some food or something.

993
01:09:50,749 --> 01:09:51,958
Yeah, of course.

994
01:09:53,376 --> 01:09:55,879
It's no big deal.
He just refers you to someone else.

995
01:09:55,962 --> 01:09:59,591
You just sort of tell him what's going on
and then he makes an assessment,

996
01:09:59,674 --> 01:10:01,593
and then that's it.

997
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:03,678
Low pressure.

998
01:10:04,638 --> 01:10:06,264
Nice. I like low pressure.

999
01:10:09,559 --> 01:10:10,894
I'll be here the whole time.

1000
01:10:12,646 --> 01:10:13,855
We're ready for you.

1001
01:10:18,610 --> 01:10:19,486
Okay.

1002
01:10:23,073 --> 01:10:25,367
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

1003
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,494
Yeah.

1004
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:37,963
Hey, you.

1005
01:10:38,046 --> 01:10:39,297
I love you.

1006
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:42,592
And that's real, okay?

1007
01:10:43,176 --> 01:10:45,971
So you just remember that.

1008
01:10:47,514 --> 01:10:50,100
That this will always be real.

1009
01:10:51,434 --> 01:10:52,644
Okay, buddy?

1010
01:10:53,603 --> 01:10:54,771
Okay, buddy.

1011
01:10:57,399 --> 01:10:58,567
I love you too.

1012
01:11:26,261 --> 01:11:27,429
Sir, are you okay?

1013
01:11:30,181 --> 01:11:31,057
Sir!

1014
01:11:53,288 --> 01:11:55,332
Nurse, he's awake.
Can we have someone in here?

1015
01:11:56,208 --> 01:11:57,042
Thank you.

1016
01:11:58,543 --> 01:11:59,628
Hey, pal.

1017
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,634
All right. Welcome back. How you feeling?

1018
01:12:06,218 --> 01:12:08,595
You've been in and out for a while now.

1019
01:12:08,678 --> 01:12:10,096
I've got a bad headache.

1020
01:12:12,015 --> 01:12:13,391
Yeah, that makes sense.

1021
01:12:13,475 --> 01:12:16,436
If you push that button,
you can get a little hit of morphine.

1022
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,689
I asked for one too,
but they were like, "Nah."

1023
01:12:20,732 --> 01:12:22,067
What's going on, Doug?

1024
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:24,945
What is going on?
A lot is actually going on.

1025
01:12:25,028 --> 01:12:28,406
I mean, the doctors will explain this
way better than me,

1026
01:12:28,490 --> 01:12:29,658
way bigger words,

1027
01:12:29,741 --> 01:12:34,371
but you had a tumor sitting
on your brain, pal.

1028
01:12:35,664 --> 01:12:37,832
They said that you're incredibly lucky

1029
01:12:37,916 --> 01:12:40,085
that you were at the hospital
when it ruptured

1030
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:41,461
or you wouldn't have made it.

1031
01:12:44,089 --> 01:12:47,217
But they... They got it?

1032
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,553
- Yeah, they operated on you.
- They got it out?

1033
01:12:49,636 --> 01:12:51,930
Got it all out. Scooped it out.

1034
01:12:52,013 --> 01:12:54,349
They said you'll be good as new
in a couple of days.

1035
01:12:54,432 --> 01:12:56,017
Well, that's good.

1036
01:12:58,353 --> 01:13:01,481
Yeah, it's really good, man.
It's really good.

1037
01:13:02,190 --> 01:13:04,150
- Yeah.
- Jesus.

1038
01:13:04,234 --> 01:13:05,443
Yeah, it's a lot.

1039
01:13:10,115 --> 01:13:11,616
Where's Vienna?

1040
01:13:15,871 --> 01:13:17,455
Okay. So...

1041
01:13:18,957 --> 01:13:23,128
So oftentimes when someone has a tumor

1042
01:13:23,211 --> 01:13:25,589
pressed against their brain
like you did,

1043
01:13:26,756 --> 01:13:30,594
apparently, it can affect the way
that they process information.

1044
01:13:30,677 --> 01:13:33,597
Right. But where is she?

1045
01:13:36,641 --> 01:13:38,560
Bart, can we wait
for the doctor to get here?

1046
01:13:38,643 --> 01:13:40,437
No, just tell me where she is.

1047
01:13:41,104 --> 01:13:44,774
- I'd rather the doctor explain.
- Where is she? Just tell me.

1048
01:13:48,612 --> 01:13:50,447
She's not real, Bart.

1049
01:13:52,532 --> 01:13:54,284
I tried to track her down.

1050
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,287
I couldn't find anything.

1051
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:00,582
None of her stuff is
at your apartment or at the hotel.

1052
01:14:00,665 --> 01:14:03,835
Yeah. Yes, it is.
What are you talking about?

1053
01:14:03,919 --> 01:14:07,797
I know it sounds impossible,
but the doctor said that this can happen.

1054
01:14:07,881 --> 01:14:08,882
This isn't funny.

1055
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,134
Give me my phone.

1056
01:14:11,885 --> 01:14:14,679
- I already checked that. It's not...
- Give me my phone, Doug.

1057
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,778
What the fuck?

1058
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,865
You erased my pictures?

1059
01:14:34,616 --> 01:14:37,285
I didn't erase them.
They were never there.

1060
01:14:37,369 --> 01:14:39,037
- You're lying.
- Bart.

1061
01:14:39,788 --> 01:14:41,456
Why are you doing this, man?

1062
01:14:41,540 --> 01:14:43,542
- I'm not lying.
- What the fuck?

1063
01:14:46,294 --> 01:14:47,379
Bart.

1064
01:14:49,714 --> 01:14:50,674
Come here.

1065
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:53,552
Come on, man.

1066
01:15:06,064 --> 01:15:09,150
It's okay.
I'm just happy you're here, man.

1067
01:15:18,076 --> 01:15:19,411
Cannonball!

1068
01:15:19,494 --> 01:15:22,289
Oh, you got me in the marbles,
Cannonball Guy.

1069
01:15:22,372 --> 01:15:24,708
- And now you must pay.
- It tickles!

1070
01:15:24,791 --> 01:15:27,419
- Daddy, he's tickling me.
- I gotcha!

1071
01:15:27,502 --> 01:15:30,297
- That tickles!
- All right, Booger Monster.

1072
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:33,341
Let's give your uncle Bart some space
so he can get settled in.

1073
01:15:33,425 --> 01:15:35,093
Bye, Booger Monster.

1074
01:15:35,176 --> 01:15:36,052
All right.

1075
01:16:06,666 --> 01:16:08,001
I think it looks cool.

1076
01:16:09,794 --> 01:16:11,004
Could be worse.

1077
01:16:12,797 --> 01:16:17,052
- Up close it looks kind of gross.
- Yeah. It's pretty fucking disgusting.

1078
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:21,348
- Thanks for getting my stuff.
- No problem.

1079
01:16:21,932 --> 01:16:25,101
You might wanna go back and double-check
to make sure I got everything.

1080
01:16:25,185 --> 01:16:28,730
'Cause I had Eve with me,
so who knows what I left behind?

1081
01:16:28,813 --> 01:16:30,649
- Will do.
- Yeah.

1082
01:16:33,777 --> 01:16:35,403
You gonna be okay in here?

1083
01:16:35,487 --> 01:16:38,323
Oh, yeah. I'll be super cozy.

1084
01:16:38,406 --> 01:16:41,785
Yeah, but are you gonna be, like, okay?

1085
01:16:45,664 --> 01:16:48,333
Did I ever tell you about the time
I went down to Cancún?

1086
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,585
- Like, years ago with Whit?
- Yeah.

1087
01:16:50,669 --> 01:16:53,380
On the plane, I was sitting
next to this older Black guy

1088
01:16:53,463 --> 01:16:55,966
wearing a head-to-toe cowboy outfit.

1089
01:16:56,049 --> 01:16:58,134
- I don't believe this.
- It's true.

1090
01:16:58,885 --> 01:17:01,513
We get to talking,
and he tells me he's from Maryland.

1091
01:17:01,596 --> 01:17:04,474
So I'm like, "What the hell is up
with the clothes? I gotta ask."

1092
01:17:05,308 --> 01:17:07,394
And he says
that he used to be a big-rig driver

1093
01:17:07,477 --> 01:17:09,437
and he would crisscross
the country every week.

1094
01:17:10,146 --> 01:17:11,898
This one time he was outside of El Paso.

1095
01:17:12,649 --> 01:17:15,151
He was getting out of his truck
and spilled coffee all over himself,

1096
01:17:15,235 --> 01:17:16,194
just everywhere.

1097
01:17:16,987 --> 01:17:19,072
So he goes to a truck stop
to get cleaned up,

1098
01:17:19,155 --> 01:17:21,366
but he decides
he's just gonna buy a new shirt.

1099
01:17:21,449 --> 01:17:24,452
But all they have are cowboy shirts.

1100
01:17:25,537 --> 01:17:30,834
So once he gets the cowboy shirt,
he figures, "Fuck it. Why not go all in?"

1101
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:34,129
So he gets the boot and the hat
and the bolo tie, the whole deal.

1102
01:17:34,796 --> 01:17:36,882
Goes into a diner to get something to eat.

1103
01:17:36,965 --> 01:17:39,467
And as he walks in the door,
this little 3-year-old girl

1104
01:17:39,551 --> 01:17:41,386
just lights up when she sees him.

1105
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:43,430
Runs up to him, gives him a big hug.

1106
01:17:43,513 --> 01:17:46,141
Has her dad come over
and take a picture together.

1107
01:17:46,224 --> 01:17:48,143
He said it was just great, made his day.

1108
01:17:48,977 --> 01:17:50,145
But that's not it

1109
01:17:50,228 --> 01:17:54,191
because, for the next two days,
everywhere he goes in this outfit,

1110
01:17:54,274 --> 01:17:56,818
people just light up when they see him.

1111
01:17:57,652 --> 01:18:02,782
And that's when he realizes
that everyone loves seeing a cowboy.

1112
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:05,202
And he loved that feeling so much,

1113
01:18:05,285 --> 01:18:10,207
of bringing that, like, simple joy
into every room he walked into,

1114
01:18:10,290 --> 01:18:12,584
that he decided from that moment on,

1115
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:15,212
he was always gonna dress like a cowboy.

1116
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:19,299
He seems like a pretty chill guy.

1117
01:18:19,382 --> 01:18:20,383
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1118
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:25,305
And I remember thinking:

1119
01:18:27,182 --> 01:18:30,477
"God, I wanna have stories like that
when I'm older," you know?

1120
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:33,480
And now it's like...

1121
01:18:35,941 --> 01:18:41,571
Well, I'm older and I have stories, but...

1122
01:18:45,867 --> 01:18:48,578
I don't know,
I thought my stories would be different.

1123
01:18:51,414 --> 01:18:52,457
I just...

1124
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,960
I thought they'd be happier.

1125
01:18:55,043 --> 01:18:57,504
Come on, Barty. They will be, man.

1126
01:18:58,213 --> 01:19:00,715
They will be. You just gotta give it time.

1127
01:19:03,593 --> 01:19:06,471
It's just, when I thought she was crazy,
she was still real.

1128
01:19:06,555 --> 01:19:10,767
You know,
I could still... hold her and smell her.

1129
01:19:12,269 --> 01:19:13,353
But now it's...

1130
01:19:15,605 --> 01:19:17,649
Look, you know I don't subscribe

1131
01:19:17,732 --> 01:19:21,069
to the whole "everything happens
for a reason" bullshit.

1132
01:19:21,945 --> 01:19:24,865
But for some reason, that girl,

1133
01:19:25,615 --> 01:19:29,035
or hallucination or...

1134
01:19:29,828 --> 01:19:31,872
I don't know,
whatever manifestation was caused

1135
01:19:31,955 --> 01:19:35,417
by that lemon-sized mass
on your frontal lobe...

1136
01:19:36,376 --> 01:19:40,881
made it so that you were at a hospital
exactly when you needed to be.

1137
01:19:43,133 --> 01:19:47,804
And for the life of me,
I can't figure out a rational reason

1138
01:19:47,888 --> 01:19:50,098
as to why the fuck that would happen.

1139
01:19:53,059 --> 01:19:56,021
But it did. And you're here.

1140
01:19:57,606 --> 01:19:59,441
I don't know, man. It's just...

1141
01:20:00,775 --> 01:20:04,738
I just know that that girl came
into your life for a reason.

1142
01:20:07,574 --> 01:20:08,825
That's enough for me.

1143
01:20:16,917 --> 01:20:19,294
I'll get you some cowboy stuff
if you want it.

1144
01:20:19,961 --> 01:20:22,005
That was actually the point
of my whole story.

1145
01:20:27,886 --> 01:20:29,679
- Knock, knock.
- Hey, Larry.

1146
01:20:29,763 --> 01:20:33,892
Hey. Dropping by to see how you're
settling in after your first week.

1147
01:20:33,975 --> 01:20:36,269
Good. Good, I think. Yeah. Thanks.

1148
01:20:36,353 --> 01:20:39,564
That's great. And just so you know,
everyone is so thrilled to have you here.

1149
01:20:39,648 --> 01:20:43,693
And if you need any more time to recover
for your head stuff, that's totally cool.

1150
01:20:43,777 --> 01:20:46,279
- I really appreciate that. Thank you.
- Nah, come on.

1151
01:20:46,363 --> 01:20:48,073
Hey, it's a medical company.

1152
01:20:48,156 --> 01:20:50,492
If anyone knows
that medical stuff happens,

1153
01:20:50,575 --> 01:20:51,701
it's us, right?

1154
01:20:53,328 --> 01:20:56,414
Yeah, I guess you would know that.

1155
01:20:56,498 --> 01:20:58,250
- Keep up the good work, partner.
- Thanks.

1156
01:21:00,585 --> 01:21:03,046
Larry, you dumb idiot.
You forgot the reason you came by.

1157
01:21:03,129 --> 01:21:07,342
Your first check. Yeah.
All right. Now I'm really leaving.

1158
01:21:07,425 --> 01:21:08,677
Thank you.

1159
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:09,803
Pound it.

1160
01:21:10,929 --> 01:21:13,390
Yeah, there you go. That'll be our thing.

1161
01:21:19,813 --> 01:21:21,857
Thank God you're still alive.

1162
01:21:21,940 --> 01:21:25,318
Yeah. It's gonna take more
than some dumb tumor to get rid of me.

1163
01:21:26,319 --> 01:21:28,029
Oh, let me look at you.

1164
01:21:30,073 --> 01:21:33,577
If I was younger
and I would've seen you across a bar

1165
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,036
- with that...
- Oh, yeah?

1166
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:37,289
I would've given you
the keys to the kingdom.

1167
01:21:38,331 --> 01:21:40,917
Man. You know,
in another life, Patricia, you and me,

1168
01:21:41,001 --> 01:21:44,045
we could've been
real destructive together.

1169
01:21:44,129 --> 01:21:45,630
I would have ruined your life.

1170
01:21:47,090 --> 01:21:48,466
I got you something.

1171
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:51,678
- Oh, no, really? That's sweet.
- Yes.

1172
01:21:51,761 --> 01:21:55,640
For all the times you saved my sanity.
One parting shot.

1173
01:21:55,724 --> 01:21:57,517
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

1174
01:21:58,185 --> 01:21:59,561
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1175
01:22:06,359 --> 01:22:08,153
Oh, I didn't tell you who's moving in.

1176
01:22:08,236 --> 01:22:10,989
- Tell me.
- Two EDM DJs.

1177
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,991
- EDM.
- No.

1178
01:22:13,074 --> 01:22:16,203
- They're a couple.
- That is so many beats per minute.

1179
01:22:16,286 --> 01:22:18,914
- It's gross.
- Love really does find a way.

1180
01:22:18,997 --> 01:22:20,415
I guess it does.

1181
01:22:22,626 --> 01:22:23,627
You don't have to rush.

1182
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,962
Those idiots aren't moving in
until tomorrow.

1183
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:27,214
Oh, here we go.

1184
01:22:28,256 --> 01:22:29,299
Mr. Morelli.

1185
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:32,886
No, you cannot keep borrowing my plunger.

1186
01:22:32,969 --> 01:22:35,680
Because you're an adult
and this is disgusting.

1187
01:22:35,764 --> 01:22:37,807
Your IBS is not my problem.

1188
01:24:55,111 --> 01:24:58,240
- This is you right here.
- Thank you. Thanks very much.

1189
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:30,814
<i>I love you, buddy. That's real.</i>

1190
01:25:32,023 --> 01:25:33,817
<i>Always yours, Vienna.</i>

1191
01:25:35,443 --> 01:25:38,989
<i>PS, look for the Pirates
to win big in the late '20s.</i>
