2
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
Let's see what you have there...

3
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,240
This picture looks scary...

4
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,240
Everyone ready?

5
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,160
Let's see it.

6
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,680
Do you believe in karma?

7
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Does a snake's mother
drink from a well?

8
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:20,400
Go drink that well water.

9
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
I'm sorry you can't go in.

10
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,920
I'm a relative.

11
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,160
You'll have to help us then.

12
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,320
Grannie doesn't trust me.

13
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,880
Grannie, what are you doing here?

14
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,480
I've been looking everywhere for you.

15
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,080
I've got to go now

16
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,520
or I won't be on time.

17
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:03,280
Grannie, where are you going?
Grannie!

18
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,320
Grannie!

19
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,560
Grannie!

20
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,120
Wait!

21
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,560
So you're back!
Yes.

22
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,400
Sawadee Khap Pong.

23
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,280
Let me help you.

24
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,320
Thanks.

25
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,000
Hey Pong what's that
powder outside? It stinks.

26
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,320
It’s some herbal powder.

27
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:00,160
With all the rain lots
of poisonous snakes came out.

28
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
Safety first!

29
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,880
Has anyone moved out lately?

30
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,600
We've got a few free rooms.

31
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
Oh, I forgot to give you this.

32
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,080
I got you some chocolate.

33
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,760
- For me?
- Yes

34
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,880
I'm very grateful.

35
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,120
Make sure you eat all of them.

36
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,240
I will.

37
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,160
Just wait for the lift, please.

38
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Thank you.

39
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,960
Shit, this is just no good.

40
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,360
I think that song
we played yesterday was OK.

41
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,960
Like the rehearsal.

42
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,920
Nong Nong (kids)

43
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:39,160
Someone's complained
about loud music in your room.

44
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,480
So can't you make
it a little quieter?

45
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,680
Come on let's go.

46
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,640
Fuck him!

47
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,360
When we rehearse it has to be noisy!

48
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,440
Yeah, how can we make it quieter?

49
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,240
I'm not deaf and dumb.

50
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,680
The phone's broken again.

51
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,080
We can't get online either.

52
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,280
There's the security guard.

53
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,520
Hey guard what's wrong with the phone?

54
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,160
Did you call the repairman yet?

55
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
I've called already and
he's coming this evening.

56
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,600
What floor, please?

57
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,680
7 please.

58
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,320
Hold on.

59
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,040
Thanks.

60
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,200
What kind of costume is that?

61
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,640
An angel.

62
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,240
Wait please!

63
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Hi, Nho?

64
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,600
I'm on the way.

65
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,160
I forgot something.

66
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,200
Yes ma'am.

67
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Hey guys, didn't it say in the
news there were more than this?

68
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,520
That's right but

69
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,640
they've all gone away.

70
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,520
These are all I could catch.

71
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:18,200
These snakes look dangerous.

72
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,160
Yeah, I know what you mean.

73
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,040
They've come out because of the rain.

74
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,280
Hey Wit, be careful.

75
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,920
Well, will you go with me?

76
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,200
You've been here already.

77
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,920
Where to?

78
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,680
What are you doing here?

79
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:36,080
Someone told me that loads
of people got snakebites here.

80
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,520
Not one.

81
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:43,080
The only thing is someone
complained their phone is broken.

82
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,160
Could you please check?

83
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,160
You can go I don't
need you for anything.

84
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,760
What's going on Khun Nin.

85
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,520
Somebody's said there were
a lot of snakebites here.

86
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,640
and they need help quickly.

87
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,800
In our building?

88
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,680
I put herbs all around the building already.

89
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,840
There shouldn't be any problems.

90
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,560
Believe me for you own good.

91
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,920
Because if what was in the news is true

92
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,360
it could be really dangerous here.

93
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,480
You better just leave.

94
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,920
Dead.

95
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,880
Dead already.

96
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,200
Grannie Pai.

97
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,480
Dead already.

98
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,240
Pai, who's dead?

99
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,320
Hey Pong, you and Chit stay here.

100
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,240
Never mind Grannie.

101
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,200
Pong, take care of everything here.

102
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,640
Yes I'll click the lift button for you.

103
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,720
Is it true, sir?

104
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,880
Yes it's true, cobras.

105
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,320
Go on, check.

106
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,680
Cobras?

107
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,040
He went out already.

108
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,360
He said that

109
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,640
he went to see his friend.

110
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,200
I'll have to put up with it.

111
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:32,160
Three to nothing.
You've lost again.

112
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,760
Today did you beat me or not?

113
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,880
So are you cheating?

114
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,160
Cheat what?

115
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
You lose all the time and say
that I've cheated...

116
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,040
I don't need to play you anymore.

117
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,800
Hey Thang come play with me.

118
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,160
Hey you can take my turn.

119
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,200
Can you go look at him?

120
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,520
You go, you lost!

121
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,800
You go look at him!

122
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,280
You order me around all the time.

123
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,880
Hey Thang what are you doing?

124
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,760
This is in real time. Why didn't you tell me?

125
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:00,640
Just let me see a little bit.

126
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,960
Get away! Get away! Get away!

127
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,240
I made that hole so let me look!

128
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,040
Move it!

129
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,800
What the fuck!

130
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,040
Aren't you gonna play?

131
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,400
Both of you,
you're only interested in sex!

132
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,080
Nobody answered.

133
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,640
That's the last room.

134
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:10,160
So it must be the right one.

135
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,160
You’d better take me up there.

136
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,640
Of course, follow me.

137
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,760
Where are you going?

138
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,760
I know the room.

139
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,680
Let me go too.

140
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,400
That's not necessary.

141
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,720
There's someone here to see you anyway.

142
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,240
I want to go too.

143
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,680
Go on, go talk to him.

144
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,400
How are you?

145
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,160
Why do you care?

146
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,400
Can't we speak in a civilized manner?

147
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,280
So when I was in a good
mood where were you?

148
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,400
- I don't understand.
- It's not that you don't understand!

149
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,040
It's because you never have the feeling.

150
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,640
Hey, you said it wouldn't be long.

151
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,160
Where's Chai?

152
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:35,320
Hold on a minute, he went upstairs.

153
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Wait again?

154
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,880
Run! Run! Run!

155
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,200
Run! Run!

156
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,680
Officer Pong!

157
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,520
What's the matter, what happened?

158
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,880
Where's Chai.

159
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,160
On the third floor.

160
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,440
What's going on up there?

161
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,880
I'm not sure. I heard some
noise so I went to look.

162
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,560
Nin, Wit, you two stay down here!

163
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,320
Don't go anywhere!

164
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,280
I'm going too.

165
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:17,240
No you're not!

166
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,920
This is my apartment you know?

167
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,440
What are we waiting for? Let's go!

168
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:24,480
Wit stay here! Don't move!

169
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,840
Hurry up!

170
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,200
Chai!

171
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,040
Stop!

172
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,600
Don't come in here.

173
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,960
What's going on Chai?

174
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,960
Hurry up Nin!

175
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:56,960
Fast!

176
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,960
Hey Chai! Chai!

177
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:06,720
Chai!

178
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,320
Help me!

179
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,960
Be calm! Be calm!

180
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,840
Please help me!

181
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,840
Help me!

182
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,600
- Be calm!
- Help me please!

183
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:18,920
Hold on I'll be back!

184
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,240
Help me!

185
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,600
Please help me!

186
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:12,960
Chai!

187
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:15,240
- Be strong
- Open your eyes, Chai!

188
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,280
Be strong! Hold on!

189
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,400
Chai how do you feel?

190
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,560
Chai!

191
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
Wake up!

192
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,000
Hurry!

193
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,240
Is there anyone else there?

194
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,840
Come on hurry up!

195
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,160
How come you look so shocked?

196
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,320
Run! Run!

197
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,440
Wit!

198
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,000
Wit!

199
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,840
Wit!

200
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,920
Wit!

201
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,000
Please!

202
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,800
Look at Chai first!

203
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,480
Chai!

204
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,680
Hey! Chai! Chai!

205
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,520
Chai!

206
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,840
Chai!

207
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,680
Mom!

208
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,360
- Get out of the way!
- I haven't seen anything yet!

209
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,240
Come on let me look!

210
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,080
What are you doing?

211
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,600
Shit!

212
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm sick of this.

213
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,600
You want it again,
Hia? (brother - friend)

214
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,320
I itch, Hia.

215
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,760
Hia.

216
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,120
What's that noise?

217
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,720
What the fuck is going on?

218
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,600
What is it?

219
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
What's wrong?

220
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,720
- Joop!
- Aek!

221
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,520
Joop!

222
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,440
Hey Tang!

223
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:32,120
It's a snake!

224
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,400
Aek!

225
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,800
Aek!

226
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,000
Tang, Tang, where are you?

227
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,240
Snake!

228
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It won't close!

229
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,440
Mae!

230
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:39,240
What the fuck is that?
Help me! Help me!

231
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,920
Mae! Help me! Help me!

232
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,720
Help me!

233
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,280
Choop go!

234
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,240
I'm your friend!

235
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,200
Can't you let me
get in there too?

236
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,440
Oh, was that the house in
the news for the snakes?

237
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh yeah, it's just near here!

238
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,360
Sure thing. I'll get over there,
get the story and send it to you fast!

239
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,600
Choop! Choop!

240
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,120
Help me!

241
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,160
Help me! Help me!

242
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,480
You've gotta help me and my friend!

243
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,800
Hey you!

244
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
Choop.

245
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,760
Help me!

246
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,040
Help me!

247
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,920
Run! Fast!

248
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:33,800
Chai!

249
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,440
Chai!

250
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:42,920
Chai!

251
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:06,160
Choop! Choop!
Don't pass out, wake up!

252
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,640
Why did you press up?
Don't you want to go down?

253
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,400
We can't go down!

254
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,320
Why not?

255
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,080
There's nothing but snakes down there.
Do you want to die?

256
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,080
Nong, don't sleep!

257
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Go take care of your friend!

258
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,760
Wake up!

259
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,280
Wit?

260
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,680
Don't sleep, Choop!

261
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,240
Wake up! Wake up!

262
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,960
Nho.. The whole building is full of snakes!

263
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,120
Is there anyone wounded?
Yes, someone's been bitten behind me.

264
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,080
Take a picture?

265
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,200
Don't pass out! Wake up!

266
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:50,160
- You want me to take a picture?
- I told you to wake up!

267
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,040
Did you get a chance to get any news?

268
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,360
Don't you want to be a reporter?

269
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,240
I just escaped with my life.

270
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,840
Hurry up! Send us a report!

271
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,880
Choop, wake up!

272
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,560
Choop, wake up!

273
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:11,480
Wake up!

274
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,440
Choop!

275
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,440
Wit!

276
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,760
Wit!

277
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:20,880
Brother!

278
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,760
Wit!

279
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,000
Brother!

280
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,240
- Brother
- Is that you Wit?

281
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Hurry up!

282
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,480
Help me! Help me!

283
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,440
Hold my hand!

284
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,520
Brother, I'll help!

285
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:06,400
Hey help my friend!

286
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
My friend’s been bitten by the snake!

287
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,480
Move!

288
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,280
Where?

289
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:12,560
On his leg.

290
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,280
Open your eyes!

291
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,680
Choop be strong, hold on!

292
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,120
Take your shirt off fast!

293
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,240
If we don't get him to
a hospital soon he won't make it!

294
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,160
Anybody got a phone?

295
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,160
I've got one!

296
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,280
I hope you're OK!

297
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,000
No signal!

298
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,920
Anyone got another one?

299
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,520
Shit!

300
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:16,960
Help me!

301
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,240
Snakes! Snakes!

302
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,040
The whole room is full of them!

303
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,200
It's not one room,
it's every room on every floor!

304
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,640
They're coming up from downstairs!

305
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,040
Where did they come from?

306
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,160
How come you let them get up here!

307
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,320
You know one of my
friends is dead already!

308
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,880
So what do you want to do now?

309
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,600
Don't move!

310
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,000
We'd better find a
way to get upstairs.

311
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,080
Mae!

312
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,600
I don't think I can make it.

313
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:33,640
Be strong. Come on.

314
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,480
Pai, we discussed this before didn't we?

315
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,320
Don't bother, let me do it my way!

316
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,240
No way!

317
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,880
If it's like this then who
would want to rent a room?

318
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,760
How does he feel now?

319
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,840
It looks pretty bad.

320
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,720
Grannie.

321
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,160
It's just karma.

322
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,520
You have to beg God for forgiveness.

323
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:35,760
We can't keep making
mistakes again and again.

324
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,080
Pornapha.

325
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,800
Pornapha.

326
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,320
Don't you understand?

327
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,480
Your daughter has bad karma.

328
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,040
I've made enough merit already.

329
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,520
I can take care of my kid.

330
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,600
You'd better look after yourself first.

331
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,600
Grannie, enough of this crap.

332
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,320
I can manage it myself.

333
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,920
Nin, are you keeping some secret from me?

334
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,840
It's not important.

335
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:36,800
Sorry, Chook.

336
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,480
Where are you going?

337
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,400
Chai, the serum's in my bag.

338
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,800
I'll go get it.

339
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,360
I'll go with you.

340
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,560
Then what about here?

341
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:03,640
Let's look for something
to block the way in.

342
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,800
Come on!

343
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,440
That should do the trick.

344
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,080
I'll get Chai's bag.

345
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,680
Then I'm coming, maybe I can help.

346
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:31,400
Hey Wit, no need to come.
Stay here.

347
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,200
No need to go.

348
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,040
The you're leaving me here?

349
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,280
No matter what when we leave
here we're all going together.

350
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,000
OK, brother.

351
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,200
Come on.

352
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,600
Just hang in there.

353
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:04,560
It hurts, it hurts so much.

354
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,320
Mae, I can't make it, I can't make it.

355
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,800
Just hang in there.

356
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,880
Just cut my leg off, Mae.

357
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,800
Are you nuts?

358
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,960
There's only way I can survive
You've gotta cut it off.

359
00:41:38,961 --> 00:41:39,961
<font color=yellow><i>Subtitle by</font></i>
<font color=red><b>Aldi Arman</font></b>

360
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,040
No way! I won't do it!

361
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,160
Please!

362
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,360
No!

363
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,920
- Like this I'm gonna die.
- No

364
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,480
You have to help me.

365
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:49,520
I won't do it!

366
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,440
- You've gotta cut it off, cut it off!
- I'm not gonna do it!

367
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,080
- I won't do it!

368
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,680
You have to help me.

369
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,720
You have to help me.

370
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,680
Help me, Mae!

371
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,480
So tell me, where will you move to?

372
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:27,600
I'm not sure yet.

373
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,040
I'm worried about you.

374
00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:36,400
You should spend more
time worrying about your job.

375
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,000
I can take care of myself.

376
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:50,680
So I 'm wrong?
The way I work, eh Nin?

377
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,800
No you're not wrong.

378
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,840
Your job just takes up all our time!

379
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,920
Never mind,

380
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:08,400
because the only thing
I need you can't give me!

381
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,040
Nin, you've changed too much!

382
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,440
I haven't changed at all!

383
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:38,600
Yes ma'am.

384
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:39,720
Where are you?

385
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,920
I'm in the building.

386
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,680
So how come you haven't
sent the pictures yet?

387
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,280
There's snakes.

388
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:51,520
Are you scared of snakes or getting fired?
No matter what you have to send them!

389
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,160
Hey, it looks worse than we thought!

390
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,200
Look at this!

391
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,320
Call the cops!

392
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,800
Not yet.

393
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:00,840
Wait until she sends some more.

394
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:08,040
What are you staring at?
Work!

395
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,080
The gods!

396
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,560
They have to be pissed off!

397
00:46:15,110 --> 00:46:18,600
We have to pray for mercy.
Please have mercy.

398
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,400
This is bullshit, begging to snake gods!

399
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:25,720
They have them for sure.

400
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,560
I already made a spirit house.

401
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,440
If you have no respect for them,
you'll die a horrible death.

402
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,560
Do you mean the spirit house
outside the building?

403
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,160
You've all lost your minds!
This is 2010!

404
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:46,800
Dad's here!

405
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,040
Dad!

406
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,840
Where have you been?

407
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,760
Run! Fast!

408
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,720
Snakes!

409
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:02,280
The snakes are marching in!

410
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,120
Come on! Move it!

411
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,520
Fast!

412
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,000
What's going on?

413
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,200
Nothing.

414
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Come on move! Fast!

415
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,920
Hurry up!

416
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,160
Hurry up!

417
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:10,960
Come on!

418
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,560
Blood!

419
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,480
Mae!

420
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,160
The lift's here!

421
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,760
Come on let's get out of here!

422
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,240
Get in! Get the baby in there!

423
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,480
Come on Grannie!

424
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:29,080
The door won't close!

425
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,040
Come on close!

426
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,120
Lift, damn you close!

427
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,920
Close!

428
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:37,560
Oh man, close!

429
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,760
Close!

430
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,440
Why won't it close!

431
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:43,960
Can't you do something?

432
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,800
Open it!

433
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,480
Open it!

434
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:05,680
Don't leave me!

435
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:07,040
Open it!

436
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:12,720
Open it!

437
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,000
Don't leave me!

438
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,960
Open it!

439
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:20,080
Open it!

440
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,680
Open it!

441
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,720
Don't leave me! Open it!

442
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,160
Open it! Open it!

443
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,080
Don't leave me!

444
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,640
Hello? Hello, is that the Police?

445
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,880
Are you there?

446
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:53,600
Hello, hello!

447
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:05,720
Oh shit!

448
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,840
Where the hell are they?

449
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:04,800
Wit!

450
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:06,200
Wit!

451
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:07,840
Wit!

452
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,680
What are you doing?

453
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:00,080
We'd better get out of here!

454
00:56:02,590 --> 00:56:03,760
What's going on?

455
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:09,200
It looks like there's
someone in that room.

456
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,080
Who's that?

457
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,040
Wit, don't!

458
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:55,560
Wit!

459
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:22,960
Grannie!

460
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,440
Grannie!

461
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,680
I'm glad everyone's still here.

462
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,840
Where's my brother?

463
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,920
Where are you going?

464
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,600
I'm gonna find my brother?

465
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:52,680
Wait a minute!

466
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,840
Help my baby a snake's bitten her!

467
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:56,280
Gif, my baby!

468
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:57,560
Gif!

469
00:57:59,070 --> 00:57:59,720
Gif!

470
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,760
Gif, my child!

471
00:58:03,710 --> 00:58:04,600
How is she Doctor?

472
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:09,200
Her leg's bitten!

473
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:10,840
Gif!

474
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,640
Gif! Gif!

475
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,320
How many bottles of
serum have you got?

476
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:20,760
Two.

477
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,040
Then give my kid one, please.

478
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:23,040
Please!

479
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,240
Hold it! If you give that kid one then

480
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,720
what about the rest?

481
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,880
How can you talk like that?

482
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:31,320
Can't you see my kid's dying!

483
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,840
Relax, everybody!

484
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:37,480
I'll be right be back!

485
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:39,840
Doctor, Doctor, where are you going?

486
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,200
You didn't give my kid a shot yet!

487
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,560
Right now your kid's still OK.

488
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:43,800
I'll be right be back!

489
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,760
Doctor please give her
the shot first and then go!

490
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,160
Please give the shot first!

491
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,960
Just relax, I'll be right back!

492
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:52,080
Give the shot first!

493
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,680
Can't you give my kid the shot first?

494
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:56,000
Can't you help us first?

495
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:56,960
Take it easy! Take it easy!

496
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:58,760
Where are you going give her the shot first!

497
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,280
Can't you just relax?

498
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,920
You're all selfish!

499
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:10,440
You know you're all making bad karma!

500
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,280
Don't you know it will all
come back on you.

501
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:28,560
Stop!

502
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:32,680
Give my daughter the shot

503
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:36,440
or else I'll shoot you!

504
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:42,040
Drop the gun!

505
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,920
Don't do anything rash!

506
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,280
Stop!

507
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,080
I beg you!

508
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,560
Mon, don't!

509
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,720
Mon, don't do it, drop the gun!

510
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:23,640
Mon, drop the gun!

511
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,520
Good, kill yourself then!

512
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,640
Then we won't waste the serum!

513
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:42,480
I'm sorry!

514
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,560
I had to do it for my baby!

515
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,120
I told you give my kid the shot now!

516
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:58,800
I'll kill you all one by one!

517
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:21,880
Help!

518
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,320
Help!

519
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,200
Pai!

520
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:11,160
Pai!

521
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,360
Pai!

522
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:40,920
It may hurt a bit
but after she'll be OK.

523
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:45,840
Thank you very much.

524
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:48,720
Thank you.

525
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:56,480
Help!

526
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:57,960
Help!

527
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:01,480
Help! Wit! Help!

528
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,200
Don't open it, Doctor!

529
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,240
Get out of the way!

530
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:08,920
Help!

531
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:11,760
Help!

532
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,560
Help!

533
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,880
Help!

534
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,240
I'll shoot you for sure!

535
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:20,280
You're gonna shoot me?

536
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:22,240
Help!

537
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,800
Help!

538
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,280
Help! Wit! Help!

539
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,400
Help!

540
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:43,200
Help!

541
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,280
Where's Wit?

542
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,040
Where's Wit?

543
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:58,680
Where's Wit?

544
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:26,200
Are you OK? Mon?

545
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,120
What's with you?

546
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,280
Hey, you've been bitten.

547
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,400
What's wrong? Let me see it!

548
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:47,520
Doctor, have you got any more serum?

549
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,000
There's only one more.
Do you need another?

550
01:05:52,510 --> 01:05:54,680
Hey, how can you say that?

551
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,480
You see, my wife looks terrible!

552
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,200
Mon!

553
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:05,400
Doctor, give her a shot! Please!

554
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,640
Just a second.

555
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:10,280
Hurry up, Doctor!

556
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:13,920
Just a second. Take it easy!

557
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,680
Hey! Where are you going?
Come back!

558
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,800
Hey you! Stop!

559
01:06:23,110 --> 01:06:24,200
Don't follow me!

560
01:06:24,710 --> 01:06:25,760
Give me that serum!

561
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:26,960
Don't touch me!

562
01:06:27,030 --> 01:06:28,280
Give me that serum!

563
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,960
Don't touch me!

564
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,960
- Let go of me!
- Give it to me!

565
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,640
Let go!

566
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,000
What the fuck have you done?

567
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,480
It's not my fault!

568
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:17,400
All of you stop staring at me!

569
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:21,080
You all look just like me anyway!

570
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,520
You don't realize what you're doing!

571
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,960
I'm not wrong!

572
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:32,720
Don't come near me!

573
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:35,960
Hold it!

574
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,400
Don't touch me!

575
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:27,120
Move it!

576
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:28,440
Fast... fast!

577
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:09,440
Mon!

578
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,240
Mon!

579
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:14,240
Mon!

580
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:17,360
Mon, hang in there!

581
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:21,640
Mom, don't die!

582
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:32,920
What's with you?

583
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,120
Can't you do anything?

584
01:09:41,350 --> 01:09:43,600
Are you a Doctor or not? Do something.

585
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,440
Get out of my way!

586
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,280
You!

587
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:57,920
It's not true!

588
01:09:59,030 --> 01:10:00,320
It's not true, Mon!

589
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,040
Hang in there!

590
01:10:07,230 --> 01:10:08,720
Don't worry, dear.

591
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,120
Mom!

592
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:38,520
Mon! Mon!

593
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,760
Mom!

594
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,480
I'm not staying here!
I'm going downstairs!

595
01:11:09,560 --> 01:11:10,960
Are you crazy!

596
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,680
Haven't you seen it?
There's only snakes down there.

597
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,240
Don't you care about your kid?

598
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,000
We've got to get away
from here or we'll die!

599
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,080
So you want down there then?

600
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,120
Don't cry!

601
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,600
This is my kid and I'll protect her myself!

602
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,280
Don't worry darling!

603
01:11:33,150 --> 01:11:34,400
There got to be a way for
us to get out of here.

604
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,000
There must be a way.

605
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:39,240
You!

606
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:41,240
Don't worry darling.

607
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:42,280
You!

608
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,080
Where did you see Wit?

609
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:29,280
In there.

610
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,040
Wit!

611
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:33,920
Wit!

612
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:36,920
Wit!

613
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:39,040
Wit!

614
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:03,920
Don't go up there!

615
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:04,840
Stop!

616
01:13:05,230 --> 01:13:05,840
Wit!

617
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:06,760
Don't go up there!

618
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:07,960
- Wit
- Don't go up there!

619
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,160
I'm telling you don't go up there!

620
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:12,960
Wit!

621
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:14,320
Wit!

622
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:16,040
I told you don't go!

623
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,280
Wit!

624
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:18,960
Wit!

625
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:21,200
- Don't go!
- Wit!

626
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:23,080
Don't go!

627
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:27,360
What the hell is going on here!

628
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:33,480
Is this what you're hiding from me?

629
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:37,160
What's the meaning of this, Grannie?

630
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:00,280
Wit!

631
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:07,160
Wit!

632
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:10,640
Wit!

633
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,040
Get it off!

634
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:16,120
Wit!

635
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,240
Wit!

636
01:14:27,310 --> 01:14:29,560
Don't! Wit!

637
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:47,920
Wit!

638
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:56,560
Wit!

639
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:58,920
Wit! Don't!

640
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:02,440
Wit!

641
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:06,120
Wit!

642
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,360
Wit!

643
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:29,560
Wit!

644
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:35,280
Are you just going to leave me here?

645
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:37,840
No matter what we have
to leave here together.

646
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:39,520
Yes sir.

647
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:33,320
What the fuck happened?

648
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:48,040
I don’t know! It's not my fault!

649
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:50,320
I didn't do it!

650
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:52,440
You didn't do it, eh?

651
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,440
Let go! Let go!

652
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,560
It's not Grannie's fault!

653
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:01,880
You've gotta believe us!

654
01:17:02,110 --> 01:17:03,360
Believe you?

655
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,520
My brother's dead!

656
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,120
How can I believe you?

657
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,880
I didn't do it!

658
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,080
Stop!

659
01:17:54,600 --> 01:17:55,640
Don't go!

660
01:17:57,350 --> 01:17:58,720
Don't go!

661
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,720
Grannie!

662
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:13,480
Nin!

663
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,840
Let go of me!

664
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:20,520
Come on!

665
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:29,200
No! No!

666
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:32,360
No!

667
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:33,320
No!

668
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:46,520
No!

669
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,600
Please forgive all of us!

670
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:10,440
Grannie!

671
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,640
Nin!

672
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,440
What's...

673
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:15,600
Hey, what's that over there?

674
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,360
What's over there?

675
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:28,120
What's that?

676
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,240
You! You!

677
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:52,800
Where are you?

678
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,440
Mom!

679
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:21,120
Mom, relax!

680
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,880
Mom!

681
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:44,640
Grannie!

682
01:24:45,800 --> 01:24:48,720
I can't.
It's payback time for the snakes!

683
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:50,520
They're not going to forgive us.

684
01:24:52,110 --> 01:24:54,920
A tattoo is the
only protection from fate!

685
01:24:55,880 --> 01:24:57,440
It's karma!

686
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:23,880
No!

687
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,520
No!

688
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,280
No matter what,
you can never escape your karma!

689
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:29,920
Mom!

690
01:28:08,310 --> 01:28:09,080
Nin!

691
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:04,800
Nin!

692
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:08,800
Nin!

693
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:18,080
Tell me, how do you
think you survived?

694
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:21,920
From a miracle or from luck?

695
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:30,240
Do you believe in the law of Karma?

696
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:38,240
I believe that if I had used my life

697
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:40,480
to help anyone else stay alive

698
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:44,440
then I'd still be alive now.

699
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,160
So in the future, what will you do?

700
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:55,080
I'll develop the serum professionally

701
01:31:57,190 --> 01:32:00,480
so that it helps those
who may need it.

702
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,520
Thank you very much.
You've made the correct decision.

703
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:08,720
No problem.

704
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:13,080
I only want to do what's best.

705
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:21,000
Just one life can save many lives,
that's invaluable.

706
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:25,280
You can never decide
who should survive or

707
01:32:25,960 --> 01:32:27,520
who's good or who's bad.

708
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:29,920
But you have to decide

709
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:37,120
what you think is right.

710
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:42,520
Only that will help you find
the correct path to follow.

711
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Darling.

712
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:31,720
Nin.

713
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,280
Nin.

714
01:36:03,270 --> 01:36:04,760
How many bottles of serum have you got left?

715
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:08,040
Two.

716
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,920
How could the Doctor survive?

717
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,920
This is unbelievable.

718
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:09,040
So how do all of you know
this is a true story?

719
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:48,560
It's true.

720
01:38:05,430 --> 01:38:06,680
It's not important.

721
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:12,600
We can sell this news anyway.
Right?
