00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:19,001
KU - FU
FROM SICILY WITH FURY ( Italian Title)

2
00:01:51,667 --> 00:01:54,331
Bravo!
Show me the power of your strength.

3
00:01:54,332 --> 00:01:57,132
Brake it with just one strike.

4
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:01,833
- But that's a tree.
- Do not argue my orders. Strike it!

5
00:02:15,234 --> 00:02:18,134
Remember the technique I tought you.

6
00:02:18,135 --> 00:02:23,635
Power. Concentration.
Strike it. STRIKE IT!

7
00:02:30,836 --> 00:02:32,036
What a pity!

8
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:36,037
For the fourtieth time
I witness this scene.

9
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:39,838
For an old man like me,
to fracture an arm, would be a disgrace.

10
00:02:39,839 --> 00:02:43,639
For you, it is a real disappointment.

11
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,542
Chinese proverb, chapter 4,
section 11.

12
00:02:47,943 --> 00:02:52,043
Master... you always speak about China.

13
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:54,744
- Why didn't you stay there?
- I wish!

14
00:02:54,945 --> 00:02:58,745
They kicked me out
because I was smuggling rice.

15
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,146
- From Beijing to Palermo?
- No, from Palermo to Beijing.

16
00:03:03,247 --> 00:03:05,247
- This way, you could earn more.
- Is that so?

17
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:06,748
Now, let's eat.

18
00:03:08,097 --> 00:03:12,014
Master,
why do I eat always vegetables?

19
00:03:12,015 --> 00:03:15,015
Because you're young,
to keep in shape to fight.

20
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:19,116
I am old, and to train you
I need to eat well.

21
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,117
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

22
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,118
The fork picks up the spaghetti well.

23
00:03:26,419 --> 00:03:29,619
- Can I taste the sauce?
- Just a little.

24
00:03:35,862 --> 00:03:37,878
Master, can I have a glass of wine.

25
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,679
- No, wine is bad for you. Water!
- Water?

26
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,680
- Water. Fresh springwater.
- From the pit.

27
00:03:57,374 --> 00:04:03,244
- I won't come up here anymore.
- And how do I do without a car?

28
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,745
- You're right.
- Sit down.

29
00:04:11,746 --> 00:04:13,946
- Important news.
- Important?

30
00:04:14,947 --> 00:04:17,947
- You must go to Rome.
- To Rome?

31
00:04:17,948 --> 00:04:18,948
Yes.

32
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:21,149
- The capital of China.
- Up to a point.

33
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:23,150
What I'm going to do to Rome?

34
00:04:23,151 --> 00:04:28,851
I've learned that the Board of Rome
has a vacancy for traffic warden...

35
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:31,952
and they are organizing a tournament
of karate and kung fu.

36
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:34,953
And the winner will fill the vacancy.

37
00:04:35,154 --> 00:04:37,954
You know who will be
the winner?

38
00:04:38,255 --> 00:04:39,755
- Will be you.
- Me?

39
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:43,456
- Yes
- Me, is impossible.

40
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:47,557
I'll send a letter of recommendation
to my friend, Kon Ki Lay.

41
00:04:47,558 --> 00:04:50,158
- I do not know, Don Vitto.
- Kon Ki Lay.

42
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:55,159
- I do not know, word of honor.
- Kon Ki Lay is my friend.

43
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,160
He's the best instructor
of all the nipponian schools.

44
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:01,261
I will ask him to help you
improve your technique.

45
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:05,262
You will help me?
Give me this honor?

46
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,263
- Exactly.
- Make me a champion?

47
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:08,464
The biggest champion.

48
00:05:10,465 --> 00:05:16,465
This way, you fill the vacancy,
marry my daughter and take care of me.

49
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:21,466
Sorry Master,
I agree with what you say...

50
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:24,467
but I live alone for so many years...

51
00:05:24,468 --> 00:05:28,468
and never had the pleasure
to meet this girl.

52
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:29,469
Are you interested?

53
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,470
- Certainly.
- Are you 18?

54
00:05:31,471 --> 00:05:33,771
- A bit more.
- Here is the picture.

55
00:05:33,772 --> 00:05:38,772
It is an erotic photography,
but innocent indeed.

56
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:41,573
But this is Leonarda!

57
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:45,874
She is 18 years.
The photo is a bit old, but...

58
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,375
I'm proud.
I'll be back a winner.

59
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:56,376
This will be my wife.
I'll defend her from all dangers.

60
00:05:56,377 --> 00:06:00,277
Dragons, dinosaurs.
I'll fight against all.

61
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,128
No one will touch her.

62
00:06:03,137 --> 00:06:04,214
Leave her alone!

63
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:13,813
KON KI LAY
SCHOOL OF MARTIAL ARTS

64
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:25,615
Moron, look where you're going.
You smashed my brand new little car.

65
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:31,616
I'll kill you. I'll flay you, damn.
Asshole.

66
00:07:32,917 --> 00:07:38,617
See what you did? Do you understand?
I'll make you just a hole, asshole.

67
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:43,618
You smashed my new little car.
Thank God. I will not forget.

68
00:07:46,619 --> 00:07:49,619
Sorry, I did not see you.

69
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,020
Big jackass!

70
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,520
Pardon me, gentlemen.

71
00:08:38,021 --> 00:08:40,021
Gentlemen,
beware of the wall!

72
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,458
I've seen you practicing.

73
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,259
You know the winner of the tournament
will fill the traffic vacancy in Rome.

74
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,260
If you continue like this,
none of you will win.

75
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,461
Do you want to win it or not?
- YES.

76
00:09:34,762 --> 00:09:37,262
How so?
- No.

77
00:09:37,463 --> 00:09:41,063
- NO!!
- Bravo Maramaldo, that's the way.

78
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:43,364
Your adversaries...

79
00:09:44,265 --> 00:09:47,264
will use all the
tricks available...

80
00:09:47,265 --> 00:09:48,265
I mean...

81
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:50,366
to win...

82
00:09:50,367 --> 00:09:53,067
- is that what you want?
- YES!!

83
00:09:53,068 --> 00:09:54,568
How so?
- NO!

84
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:08,069
- Who are you?
- "SHA KI."

85
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,070
"SHA KI"

86
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:14,271
"NAGAGE SHA KI"

87
00:10:18,396 --> 00:10:20,787
Stand up my son.

88
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,788
- "SHA KE NAGAGE."
- Yes.

89
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:29,789
- Who are you?
- I'm sent by Don Vitto.

90
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,590
- Who is he?
- The big shot of Sicily.

91
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,091
What does he want?

92
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,692
A letter for you.

93
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:48,493
Maramaldo read it.

94
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:57,300
- You're a tough one.
- Modesty aside.

95
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,001
- Are you strong?
- Yes.

96
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:04,176
What then are you here for?

97
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:10,377
Maramaldo,
teach him a lesson.

98
00:11:52,974 --> 00:11:56,328
Very well.
You're in the place you're looking for.

99
00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:00,529
For the police vacancy,
you'll have to prove you're worth.

100
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,830
Ma'am... have you asked already?
What is your specialty?

101
00:12:19,931 --> 00:12:25,931
Everything that is Chinese.
Earthworms, mashed ants, beetle sauce.

102
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,068
Roasted dog.

103
00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:29,012
Cockroach white soup.

104
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:33,033
- It makes my stomach sick.
- Is there something lighter?

105
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:36,034
Want something lighter?
- Yes, two doses.

106
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:39,335
- Yes undercooked.
- Want undercooked?

107
00:12:40,336 --> 00:12:42,036
They have everything hidden inside.

108
00:12:42,037 --> 00:12:44,337
Two doses of locusts
to table 4.

109
00:12:45,338 --> 00:12:47,888
Here, stir this.

110
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,467
Tastes better this way.

111
00:12:58,468 --> 00:13:00,609
Here is the champion.

112
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:05,923
I was a great champion.

113
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:07,352
in the art of Kung Fu...

114
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:10,370
and also Fu Manchu,
and everything else.

115
00:13:10,371 --> 00:13:12,570
Abebe,the local striker,
bang, bang...

116
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:16,503
- You're a buffoon.
- No, he's not a buffoon.

117
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,030
He was a rising promise.
Used to show such powerful strikes...

118
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,964
up to the day he got mad
and wanted to destroy the Pisa Tower.

119
00:13:22,131 --> 00:13:26,176
- The Pisa Tower? -
Yes. He kept striking it, bang, bang...

120
00:13:26,177 --> 00:13:28,021
with all that fat
jumping up and down.

121
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:33,147
There he goes, the strongest of all,
watch out Europe...

122
00:13:38,564 --> 00:13:42,152
Sit there and wait. I'll talk
to the owner to get you a place to sleep.

123
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:48,353
What a cozy Chinese restaurant.

124
00:13:52,954 --> 00:13:56,354
- Sir, are you eating?
- Yes, what is the specialty?

125
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,304
- Earthworms, mashed ants,
- No, no.

126
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:05,605
- Beetle sauce.
- No. Thank you.

127
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:07,606
- Roasted dog.
- No.

128
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:10,807
- Cockroach white soup.
- No, no. Absolutely not.

129
00:14:10,908 --> 00:14:14,208
- Chinese specialty
- Yes, that yes.

130
00:14:29,521 --> 00:14:31,217
Sir, enjoy it.

131
00:15:02,218 --> 00:15:03,218
Waiter.

132
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:11,219
- How can I help you, Sir? Like it?
- Immense.

133
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,820
- Get me another.
- Want another specialty?

134
00:15:14,821 --> 00:15:16,021
- Italian, please.
- Yes sir.

135
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:18,222
Alright.
Bring me Italian pasta.

136
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:36,223
- Forgive me... want to eat in peace?
- What, looking for war?

137
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:38,832
- Why are you touching the girl?
- Because she is good.

138
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:43,016
I did not like the shirt.

139
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,573
- Here is your plate.
- Bring me a drink. - Yes sir.

140
00:16:31,223 --> 00:16:37,223
Now, I'll sing a song
from Northern China.

141
00:16:37,224 --> 00:16:42,224
It is the drama of a woman
abandoned by her husband.

142
00:16:42,425 --> 00:16:45,225
And her enormous pain.

143
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:04,381
Bravo

144
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:16,467
This time since you've liked it,
I'll sing another song.

145
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:21,468
"Pendriosa."
An allusion to spring.

146
00:17:21,469 --> 00:17:25,956
To the nature that surrounds us
and we sometimes mistreat.

147
00:17:48,957 --> 00:17:52,263
And now, to the gentle request...

148
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,185
I'll sing a melancholy song...

149
00:17:56,415 --> 00:17:57,716
- Get ready.
- Yes.

150
00:17:57,717 --> 00:18:04,427
which portrays the drama of a seller,
watching the cutting of her husband's leg

151
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:30,870
Now, another song.

152
00:18:35,871 --> 00:18:38,316
If it keeps this way
we'll get enough for tomorrow.

153
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:42,217
- Yeah, but it is best to walk.
- Walk, nothing. Okay, let's go.

154
00:18:42,218 --> 00:18:46,532
Enough.
Bring that poor to drink something.

155
00:18:48,933 --> 00:18:51,401
Come on,
the boss wants to talk to you.

156
00:18:52,934 --> 00:18:53,997
Stop!

157
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:35,611
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

158
00:19:36,612 --> 00:19:38,232
- Attila.
- The scourge of God.

159
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,178
- Everyone fears me wherever I go.
- Not everyone!

160
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,390
- It is racy, the fool.
- So it seems.

161
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,114
- You know who I am?
- No.

162
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:49,611
I'm Franco.
Known as "The Prickly Pear."

163
00:19:49,612 --> 00:19:52,659
- And what do you do?
- I'll show you...

164
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,619
if you touch me in the wound.

165
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,658
I belong to the school of
Master Kon Ki Lay.

166
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:03,225
I arrived this morning on the ferry.

167
00:20:04,926 --> 00:20:08,405
- We have a champion here, guys.
- Modesty aside.

168
00:20:08,406 --> 00:20:12,486
He is from Master Ki Kon Lay's school.
Now you have a worthy opponent.

169
00:20:28,487 --> 00:20:29,728
We put a bit of salt.

170
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:34,024
A bit of lettuce,
comes in handy.

171
00:20:34,025 --> 00:20:36,778
Then add pepper.

172
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,449
A bit of olive oil.

173
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:49,574
It is my hand!

174
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:51,322
Goddamn you!

175
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:56,003
Boys, put him to fly.

176
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:06,880
Misfortunes never come alone.

177
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:21,104
My children,
this place is very special...

178
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,431
that we can not change it.

179
00:21:24,432 --> 00:21:27,780
My daughter loves the bar so much...

180
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,776
that I tolerate a lot.

181
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:35,737
- But when someone causes disorders,
I want to know. - And why?

182
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:38,850
So I can beat them up!

183
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,394
Bravo!
Superb!

184
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:48,895
Allow me to congratulate you.

185
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:54,896
Bravo! Spectacular.
What a headbutt.

186
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:58,297
I know hard heads,
but yours,

187
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:04,198
is an authentic weapon, powerful,
worthy of you.

188
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,199
- My congratulations.
- Thank you.

189
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,600
- You're welcome.
- Where did you get in from?

190
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:13,601
- Through there.
- Through there?

191
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:14,902
- Yes
- Of course.

192
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:17,903
What do you do?

193
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:59,424
Do you like where you sleep.
It is close to mine.

194
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:03,743
Yes, I do.
I'm just not happy with your father.

195
00:23:03,744 --> 00:23:05,744
Kekkorr Captive.

196
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:08,460
No. Kekkorr Nocaptive.

197
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:13,461
He makes no distinctions.
Captive worker, fair, unfair...

198
00:23:13,562 --> 00:23:16,462
and then sends everyone away.

199
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:18,963
I find a strange name.
"Kekkorr."

200
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:25,064
No, Ke Colonel.
It's the surname.

201
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:28,565
- The other is the name.
- Oh, Ke Cuckold?

202
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:33,566
But I like his name.
Ke Cuckold.

203
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:36,567
Look, another school.
Who will it belong to?

204
00:23:36,568 --> 00:23:39,368
This is the school of Lho Kon Te.

205
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:44,369
It is attended by the evil ones
that ruined my show.

206
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:49,870
It should be big-shots.
Look at the letters, what do they mean?

207
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:53,171
I means: we are the best.

208
00:23:53,672 --> 00:23:55,172
Attention!

209
00:24:01,656 --> 00:24:03,392
You're a bunch of cowards.

210
00:24:03,393 --> 00:24:06,393
What a great show you put out.

211
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:09,794
- We have to win at any cost.
- We will.

212
00:24:11,795 --> 00:24:15,155
This is a speech,
not a two way conversation.

213
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,531
Listen carefully.

214
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:24,532
That police vacancy
must be ours.

215
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:30,033
It is a position
of great importance.

216
00:24:29,955 --> 00:24:34,842
Whoever holds it
will be the master of Rome.

217
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:42,843
Thus,
we have to win the tournament.

218
00:24:43,844 --> 00:24:46,744
But we have to be careful.

219
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:56,745
We have to study the opponent.
Find a weak spot.

220
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,641
And find out everything
that goes on Kon Ki Lay's school.

221
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:09,993
Do you know anyone there,
that can be our spy.

222
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:12,243
Yes, a certain Aldo Marama.

223
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:20,044
- Maramaldo
- Yes, a treacherous, jealous guy.

224
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:26,248
Very well.
Bribe him! Hire him!

225
00:25:27,143 --> 00:25:29,384
And to get everything in order...

226
00:25:29,685 --> 00:25:34,385
I will have sent from Milan,
three killers, friends of mine.

227
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:37,468
Ki Kaka Mai,

228
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:39,527
Tutti Li Tui

229
00:25:39,928 --> 00:25:40,933
Va A Fan,

230
00:25:41,934 --> 00:25:45,627
- But these are professional killers.
- That's right.

231
00:25:47,228 --> 00:25:51,020
This way we can eliminate
all the men of Ki Kon Lay.

232
00:26:07,187 --> 00:26:12,735
- My God, Mary! Who are they, moroccans?
- I wish, we'll see what they want.

233
00:26:53,736 --> 00:26:55,402
1500 lire.

234
00:26:58,403 --> 00:27:00,825
Help.
Bandits on the loose.

235
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:21,261
Great idea
to pretend to be...

236
00:27:21,262 --> 00:27:22,395
turists.

237
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:54,784
Today I will show you...

238
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:56,854
how to fight Kung-Fu.

239
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,689
The deadly struggle.

240
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:03,159
- The unforgiving. Give me your hand.
- Ooooh!

241
00:28:03,856 --> 00:28:04,960
Quiet!

242
00:28:07,624 --> 00:28:08,861
- Ear
- Ooooh!

243
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:12,252
Quiet!

244
00:28:13,253 --> 00:28:14,253
The eyes.

245
00:28:15,254 --> 00:28:18,172
- Ooooh!
- Quiet!

246
00:28:19,173 --> 00:28:20,173
I see nothing.

247
00:28:21,174 --> 00:28:24,474
What the eyes can't seen,
the heart can't feel.

248
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:39,050
The samurai.

249
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:47,551
What do you want here?

250
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:49,552
Who are you?

251
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:55,091
- Ki Kaka Mai,
- The Deaf.

252
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:57,485
- Tutti Li Tui.
- The Mute.

253
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,555
- The Fan Van.
- The Blind-dust.

254
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,431
Out of my school.

255
00:29:09,775 --> 00:29:11,598
Oh my God!

256
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:13,999
Help me!

257
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,999
Get ready to fight!

258
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Attack!

259
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:33,648
Go Maramaldo

260
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:46,338
Poor Maramaldo.

261
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,317
Go!

262
00:31:57,286 --> 00:31:59,775
- I do not I fight.
- Use the Kung-Fu.

263
00:31:59,976 --> 00:32:01,576
Do not insist.

264
00:32:01,577 --> 00:32:02,877
- Aren't you brave?
- Yes, I am.

265
00:32:03,648 --> 00:32:09,105
- Then, go.
- No! I'm against violence.

266
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,332
Get out of here!

267
00:32:27,333 --> 00:32:30,533
Coward.
See what they did to Maramaldo.

268
00:32:30,634 --> 00:32:36,034
- Get out, traitor!
- Have mercy.

269
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:38,235
You do not have guts
for martial arts.

270
00:33:04,536 --> 00:33:08,236
Moron! You again.
Don't you see where you're going.

271
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:12,237
You smashed into
my new little car again.

272
00:33:12,838 --> 00:33:17,238
Fortunately I have insurance.
If I grab you, I smash your head.

273
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:21,239
You're lucky I'm calm.
You jerk.

274
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,940
Be calm, be calm.
Go slow!

275
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:34,641
- What do you want?
- Beer.

276
00:33:36,342 --> 00:33:37,642
Beer.

277
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:39,743
Beer.

278
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,143
Beer.

279
00:36:12,144 --> 00:36:13,336
Three beers.

280
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:29,149
- How much beer do you have?
A lot.

281
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,422
One box.

282
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,787
Two boxes.

283
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:32,952
Three boxes.

284
00:38:41,553 --> 00:38:43,140
My poor luck.

285
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:48,063
- You again.
- I didn't mean to...

286
00:39:00,064 --> 00:39:01,276
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

287
00:39:02,277 --> 00:39:05,885
That's what I thought.
Very clever, bravo, bravo.

288
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:08,830
It's amazing what a few beers
can do, isn't it?

289
00:39:09,831 --> 00:39:15,162
Just that sometimes we do things
we shouldn't. Come a bit closer.

290
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:23,940
No! Not me.

291
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:28,269
I have a headache.

292
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,902
I beg you, I beg you.

293
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,587
I have a headache.

294
00:39:34,988 --> 00:39:36,346
Headache.

295
00:39:36,347 --> 00:39:40,261
- Where, where?
- Here, at the side of the head.

296
00:39:40,662 --> 00:39:42,342
- At the side of the head.
-Let me see.

297
00:39:53,543 --> 00:39:56,023
The secret of karate...

298
00:39:57,024 --> 00:39:58,776
lies in the close relationship...

299
00:39:58,977 --> 00:40:02,794
with the philosophy of life and
their continuous improvement.

300
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:13,038
SemPo Kojo.

301
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:17,526
Ju Jutsu.

302
00:40:19,539 --> 00:40:20,559
Kung Fu.

303
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,895
What will it be, a Chinese fungus?

304
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:27,236
What the hell is this chapter about?

305
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,076
May I come in?

306
00:40:45,077 --> 00:40:47,628
What is it?
What the hell of a manner to get in?

307
00:40:48,629 --> 00:40:52,084
Sorry master, got distracted and the fist
took more power than I predicted.

308
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:55,741
I didn't like what you did.
Go away! Go away!

309
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:07,233
And I had so much faith in you.

310
00:41:07,034 --> 00:41:08,397
And you what do you do?

311
00:41:08,398 --> 00:41:13,063
- You contribute to that disaster.
- Master, I want to redeem myself.

312
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:16,827
- Why? - I won't let
an old man to be humiliated..

313
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:19,247
as well as his fellow pupils.

314
00:41:20,948 --> 00:41:23,202
- Who is the old man?
- It is the master.

315
00:41:23,203 --> 00:41:26,250
I?
I'm not even a centenarian.

316
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:31,833
- Forgive me.
- I'm near, 97, 96, 95.

317
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,610
- You have a great appearance.
- Yes, yes.

318
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:39,376
- You know why?
- A special diet?

319
00:41:39,677 --> 00:41:40,679
No.

320
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,641
A specific treatment.

321
00:41:45,642 --> 00:41:46,751
What could it be?

322
00:41:49,752 --> 00:41:52,189
Because I follow the strict rules...

323
00:41:53,357 --> 00:41:54,637
of a guide book.

324
00:41:57,672 --> 00:42:00,637
- A last "bieta"
- And as such...

325
00:42:00,738 --> 00:42:04,884
- I'm going to reveal you a secret.
- Thank you Master.

326
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:06,434
That'll be very helpful.

327
00:42:07,935 --> 00:42:09,435
Kiss my hand,
not yours.

328
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:13,680
Do you know what is Kung Fu?

329
00:42:13,773 --> 00:42:16,738
Sure.
We eat it all the time in Sicily.

330
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,896
- What?
- "Che stato."

331
00:42:19,897 --> 00:42:22,945
- How "Che stato?"
- Ku fu is "Che stato."

332
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,741
- What is ku fu?
- It's the same thing.

333
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:25,987
Kung Fu!

334
00:42:26,888 --> 00:42:29,403
- In Chinese dialect.
- You got it spot on.

335
00:42:29,404 --> 00:42:34,009
- It is a defensive and offensive
millenial art. - Millenial?

336
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,532
Keep it in mind.
I'll teach it to you.

337
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:39,326
- Thank you.
- And more...

338
00:42:39,627 --> 00:42:40,961
Kiss mine.

339
00:42:41,962 --> 00:42:43,795
And another thing
I want to tell you.

340
00:42:43,896 --> 00:42:46,685
- Yes
- Take a look around...

341
00:42:46,686 --> 00:42:49,643
- to see if anyone is listening to us.
- Leave it to me.

342
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,758
Tiki, tiki, tiki, te,
unstoppable in karate.

343
00:43:02,759 --> 00:43:06,297
Tiki,tiki,tiki, two,
unstoppable in Kung Fu.

344
00:43:15,032 --> 00:43:17,041
- Nobody around.
- Listen.

345
00:43:17,442 --> 00:43:23,022
- I'll tell you something nobody knows.
- Nobody?

346
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:26,306
I'll make you
an invincible man.

347
00:43:27,307 --> 00:43:29,421
A very strong man.

348
00:43:29,422 --> 00:43:31,422
- An unbeatable man.
- Unbeatable?

349
00:43:31,423 --> 00:43:34,023
- A superman.
- Like Flash Gordon?

350
00:43:34,024 --> 00:43:34,997
Stronger.

351
00:43:34,998 --> 00:43:37,051
- Like Batman?
- Stronger.

352
00:43:38,052 --> 00:43:40,892
I got it.
Like the member kitt.

353
00:43:40,893 --> 00:43:43,959
- Much stronger. This one is nothing.
- Nothing?

354
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,351
You'll possess the power of the
" Hand of Travertine."

355
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:53,263
- The " Hand of Travertine?"
- But you can only use it...

356
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:57,767
for sports, not for personal use.

357
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,376
- Remember that.
- I swear.

358
00:44:06,077 --> 00:44:07,104
Come in.

359
00:44:15,105 --> 00:44:16,389
Are they for me?

360
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:18,719
- Yes.
- Thank you.

361
00:44:28,956 --> 00:44:32,073
You know,
I won't send you away anymore.

362
00:44:32,074 --> 00:44:34,864
I have always been alone.

363
00:44:34,865 --> 00:44:39,524
Getting hit by tomatoes, potatoes,
eggs, waiting for him to come...

364
00:44:39,525 --> 00:44:42,211
- to give love.
- Yes, I understand.

365
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:45,350
A young woman can not live like this.

366
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:48,541
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

367
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,063
-Are you happy?
- Yes.

368
00:44:51,064 --> 00:44:53,350
Letter from the fiancée?

369
00:44:53,351 --> 00:44:57,394
No, poor thing,
she can't read nor write.

370
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,343
She is illiterate.

371
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:03,616
Well, to a certain extent.

372
00:45:03,817 --> 00:45:07,828
You are right.
Let me show you something.

373
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:16,478
Here it is.
I have her always with me.

374
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:18,642
- Is it your daughter?
- No, it's my fiancée.

375
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:21,835
- She's a little baby.
- She was a little baby.

376
00:45:21,836 --> 00:45:23,904
But it's been so many years.

377
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:26,692
It's like anything, a land that
if not taken care of...

378
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:29,812
only grows grass, you know?
Do you like her?

379
00:45:29,813 --> 00:45:31,753
Do you want me
to tell you something?

380
00:45:31,754 --> 00:45:33,286
I don't care.

381
00:45:33,287 --> 00:45:35,578
I'm happy for you.

382
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:40,239
- And you, why are you happy?
- I'm happy because I have a secret.

383
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,785
- A secret?
- Yes, but I can not tell anyone.

384
00:45:43,786 --> 00:45:47,782
So, you think I'm a nobody.

385
00:45:47,783 --> 00:45:49,529
Well, I did not want to offend you.

386
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:54,920
You are, soul, body, mind, fire.
You're everything to me.

387
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,584
But it's a secret.

388
00:45:57,585 --> 00:45:59,491
- So, tell me!
- If I tell you,

389
00:45:59,792 --> 00:46:01,671
- you won't tell anyone?
- No. - Do you swear?

390
00:46:02,672 --> 00:46:05,842
- What is it?
- It is a Chinese oath.

391
00:46:06,843 --> 00:46:09,125
- And this, what is it?
- It's a Sicilian oath.

392
00:46:09,126 --> 00:46:14,222
In fact, it is a Neapolitan oath,
a song from a certain Franco Rizzo.

393
00:46:15,223 --> 00:46:16,375
- Tell me.
- It's like this.

394
00:46:16,576 --> 00:46:19,704
- My master Kon Ki Lay...
- Your master Kon Ki Lay...

395
00:46:19,705 --> 00:46:22,782
- revealed to me...
- revealed to you...

396
00:46:23,383 --> 00:46:26,302
- the secret...
- the secret...

397
00:46:26,503 --> 00:46:30,830
- of the "Hand of Travertine."
- of the "Hand of Travertine."

398
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,831
- And who is he?
- He is...

399
00:47:27,432 --> 00:47:28,872
Master Lho Kon Te?

400
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:38,563
Master Lho Kon Te?

401
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,036
Where is
Master Lho Kon Te?

402
00:47:58,637 --> 00:48:04,435
I have something important to tell
Master Lho Kon Te.

403
00:48:15,736 --> 00:48:17,010
What is this?

404
00:48:20,011 --> 00:48:22,154
- What is going on here?
- Master...

405
00:48:22,155 --> 00:48:24,829
I have something important
to tell you.

406
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:29,814
Master Kon Ki Lay is teaching
Franco, a secret from Ancient China.

407
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:31,815
The "Hand of Travertine."

408
00:48:31,816 --> 00:48:35,090
- From Ancient China?
The "Hand of Travertine?"  - Yes.

409
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:46,924
- Who is this Franco?
-It's the new pupil of Master Kon Ki Lay.

410
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:51,964
- Can this Franco, win the tournament?
- Yes.

411
00:48:52,165 --> 00:48:58,384
- And why do you betray your master?
- Because I was the favorite...

412
00:48:58,385 --> 00:49:02,546
The bravest of all. I Beat them all,
but with the arrival of this Franco...

413
00:49:02,547 --> 00:49:07,077
Now, everybody beat me,
everybody...

414
00:49:07,078 --> 00:49:11,966
Bravo. You have a
great sense of honor.

415
00:49:11,967 --> 00:49:16,703
This vengeful heart of yours
will...

416
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:22,317
kill you.
May my hand be with you.

417
00:49:24,018 --> 00:49:25,318
Thank you master.

418
00:49:35,935 --> 00:49:38,029
- You're new around here?
- Yes, I'm passing by.

419
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,732
- I'm mr. Strozzi, the store owner.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:44,309
- Do you practice Karate or Kung Fu?
- Karate.

421
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:46,770
We have everything for karate.

422
00:49:49,171 --> 00:49:51,872
We have everything for the sport
and the best.

423
00:49:51,873 --> 00:49:54,973

We are here to serve you.
See, this here.

427
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:08,386
An ancient mask.
See, what a beauty.

428
00:50:08,387 --> 00:50:11,966
- Very well.
- And this, so beautiful.

429
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:15,060
- I mean ...
- See this.

430
00:50:15,961 --> 00:50:20,908
- A hand bag.
- I can not buy anything because...

431
00:50:20,943 --> 00:50:23,448
- I have no money.
- No problem.

432
00:50:23,549 --> 00:50:25,822
We sell on credit.
Let us note in the book.

433
00:50:29,423 --> 00:50:32,838
Monthly, okay?
Let's start with the date.

434
00:50:34,733 --> 00:50:40,212
Rome, May 29,
and the rest, we'll write later.

435
00:50:44,277 --> 00:50:47,934
Thank you. Come again.
Goodbye.

436
00:50:59,835 --> 00:51:03,003
- What a beautiful place. Magnificent.
- I brought you here...

437
00:51:03,004 --> 00:51:06,747
- for you to practice in secret.
- Thank you, master.

438
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:08,258
No one must know.

439
00:51:10,259 --> 00:51:12,996
Today we start with the exercise
of our mentor.

440
00:51:12,997 --> 00:51:15,099
- Yes, of course.
- My father.

441
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:17,229
- From your father.
- From now on...

442
00:51:18,930 --> 00:51:21,143
have a deep breath,
breathe.

443
00:51:21,844 --> 00:51:24,119
What is it?

444
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,906
- I'm choking.
-You have to get used to this air.

445
00:51:27,907 --> 00:51:32,254
- This air.
-Look around. Here we don't see a soul.

446
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:35,419
Today we start practicing.

447
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,014
Come, come.
Lower.

448
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:51,954
- Master, it is heavy.
- What heavy. It is your impression.

449
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:54,695
- My impression?
- Come, come.

450
00:51:54,896 --> 00:51:58,603
- Until that house.
- That's  3 kilometers.

451
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:05,526
- This is to strengthen the muscles.
- They are hard as rocks.

452
00:52:05,527 --> 00:52:09,193
Rocks what?
Keep going.

453
00:52:09,228 --> 00:52:12,692
- Be strong?
- Come on,  come on.

454
00:52:12,693 --> 00:52:15,342
- Come on.
- We are arriving

455
00:52:15,343 --> 00:52:18,616
You showed your strength.

456
00:52:19,617 --> 00:52:23,809
Put it here. Here.

457
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,110
Slowly. Inside
are my best clothes.

458
00:52:29,111 --> 00:52:32,222
- Slowly, slowly.
- I can't anymore!

459
00:52:33,223 --> 00:52:35,223
Bravo, my son!

460
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:59,304
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing? Get up!

461
00:52:59,305 --> 00:53:02,416
- Get up!
- I have no strength.

462
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:26,646
Bravo. It's enough.
You did a great job today.

463
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:31,377
- Following the tradition of our father...
- Master kon Ki Lay.

464
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:36,223
- Do you want me to bring the furniture?
- No, no.

465
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:42,505
- I don't need. I'll do everything. Go.
- He's a miser, let's go.

466
00:53:47,506 --> 00:53:50,117
- We spoke of...
- Of your father.

467
00:53:50,118 --> 00:53:52,236
- Of course. My father.
- Yes.

468
00:53:52,237 --> 00:53:56,022
- The master had many parents?
- Yes, many.

469
00:53:56,023 --> 00:53:58,404
- And mothers?
- Ah, mothers, only one.

470
00:54:07,405 --> 00:54:12,357
This will be the first training
to strengthen the hand.

471
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:15,726
- These ones!
- We start like this.

472
00:54:15,727 --> 00:54:20,139
Pay attention.
Put your hands in there like this.

473
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,732
I have to put my hands
inside this hot cauldron?

474
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:27,954
- But, master, I'm afraid.
- What the hell of Chinese are you?

475
00:54:27,955 --> 00:54:30,957
- It's burning hot!
- See as I do!

476
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:37,320
I have long sleeves.
You try.

477
00:54:37,321 --> 00:54:40,515
- You want me to try with my hands?
- Yes, with your hands.

478
00:54:44,516 --> 00:54:46,646
- With all the strength?
- Yes.

479
00:54:46,647 --> 00:54:48,914
- More than once.
- Yes.

480
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:53,500
Sant Rosaly, I promise...

481
00:54:58,501 --> 00:55:00,901
Very well. Bravo!

482
00:55:04,902 --> 00:55:06,902
Come on! Come on!

483
00:55:10,903 --> 00:55:15,087
Today, we'll start the hardest part
of your training

484
00:55:15,388 --> 00:55:18,980
It is the "Hand of Travertine."

485
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:23,322
- Master, can't we skip
the "Travertine" training? - No, no!

486
00:55:23,323 --> 00:55:27,394
- I failed the Kung-Fu lessons.
- That's not true.

487
00:55:27,395 --> 00:55:29,484
I am the instructor here.

488
00:55:29,485 --> 00:55:33,306
And I think you'll do very well.

489
00:55:33,307 --> 00:55:36,590
- You think? - Sure.
You'll see, everything will be alright.

490
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:40,128
- If you think?
- Listen to me.

491
00:55:40,129 --> 00:55:43,559
You should hit the wall
with the bottom of the hand...

492
00:55:43,788 --> 00:55:48,323
to strengthen it,
in this way.

493
00:55:49,324 --> 00:55:52,917
- A quick swipe.
- Exactly.

494
00:55:53,918 --> 00:55:55,521
On the wall.

495
00:55:55,918 --> 00:56:00,402
First lightly, then harder
and finally with full force.

496
00:56:00,403 --> 00:56:02,752
- If I got ir right, with bottom of hand.
- Yes.

497
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:07,073
- But I fracture the arm.
- No.

498
00:56:08,074 --> 00:56:12,802
It is to strengthen it.
I'll show you. See!

499
00:56:17,803 --> 00:56:21,803
But why should I do it?
It's you who should show courage.

500
00:56:22,804 --> 00:56:25,914
- You're the one who must do it.
- Me? - Ready? Go for it!

501
00:56:33,915 --> 00:56:36,921
Guys, the house was fully
destroyed.

502
00:56:36,922 --> 00:56:39,756
Wait a minute
I'll check it out.

503
00:56:42,757 --> 00:56:45,432
Hey, don't you go with Mr. Rodrigo?

504
00:56:45,433 --> 00:56:46,933
What a disgrace!

505
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:50,453
Guys, someone was
down there.

506
00:56:50,454 --> 00:56:51,454
Let's get out of here.
Quickly.

507
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:54,542
I told you to check before.

508
00:56:57,543 --> 00:57:00,296
Fantastic.
How did you do it?

509
00:57:01,297 --> 00:57:02,823
That's amazing.

510
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:10,247
You've got invincible power.
I'm proud of you, you know?

511
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:44,480
- It was Maramaldo. - Yes
- He has no hands!

512
00:57:45,481 --> 00:57:48,398
What does he wants his hands for?

513
00:57:50,482 --> 00:57:52,171
My hands?

514
00:57:59,172 --> 00:58:03,021
Stop! Do not move,
or else you're dead.

515
00:58:03,022 --> 00:58:07,745
If it's a kidnapping, you got the
wrong person because I haven't a nickel.

516
00:58:07,746 --> 00:58:10,194
It's not a kidnapping. You're coming
with us. It is an invitation.

517
00:58:10,409 --> 00:58:14,516
An invitation with two knives
pointed to Franco.

518
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:19,034
- Okay, where do you take me?
- You don't need to know.

519
00:58:19,035 --> 00:58:20,736
- Who invites me?
- You don't need to know.

520
00:58:20,737 --> 00:58:23,577
- You don't need.
Get in, get in.

521
00:58:23,778 --> 00:58:27,267
Okay, without shouting.
I told it was a kidnapping.

522
00:58:31,268 --> 00:58:32,833
Thank you.

523
00:59:26,387 --> 00:59:29,098
Remember, you will only use
the "Hand of Travertine"...

524
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:34,447
for sport activities and not
for personal matters.

525
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:36,948
Come closer.

526
00:59:42,848 --> 00:59:44,553
Sit down please.

527
01:00:28,554 --> 01:00:32,460
- Do you know where you are?
- Of course I do.

528
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:35,558
In the school of a big shot.

529
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:42,007
- And do you know who I am?
- Of course I do. Master Lho Kon Te.

530
01:00:42,008 --> 01:00:47,903
And you are not afraid?
- No. Why should I?

531
01:00:47,904 --> 01:00:51,080
- Do you know why I brought you here?
- No.

532
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:56,337
- To make you a proposal.
- A proposal?

533
01:00:56,338 --> 01:00:57,731
- Yes
- What kind?

534
01:00:57,732 --> 01:01:04,154
Simple. In the next tournament
you'll fight for my school.

535
01:01:04,155 --> 01:01:07,216
- Do you accept?
- No.

536
01:01:07,217 --> 01:01:11,378
- Why not? Because I won't betray
master Kon Ki Lay.

537
01:01:12,379 --> 01:01:18,660
- Besides...
- Oh, I forgot.

538
01:01:19,526 --> 01:01:23,534
the 'Hand of Travertine?"
You know what we'll do with his hand?

539
01:01:23,535 --> 01:01:25,636
The headstone of your grave.

540
01:03:53,537 --> 01:04:00,790
After this demonstration,
do you accept my proposal?

541
01:05:17,248 --> 01:05:21,453
Franco, what are you doing?
You're reaking the promise.

542
01:05:21,454 --> 01:05:25,192
Kiss it.
That's it.

543
01:05:25,227 --> 01:05:30,044
Kiss it.
Remember the "Hand of Travertine."

544
01:05:30,045 --> 01:05:35,217
That's better.
Be patient.

545
01:05:36,413 --> 01:05:40,283
Show your power.
Show who you are.

546
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:21,741
Open the windows.

547
01:06:21,942 --> 01:06:23,523
Unlock the doors.

548
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:30,800
Besides the "Hand of Travertine",
he also has a loose ass.

549
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,242
Damn you, again!

550
01:07:05,243 --> 01:07:08,041
- I don't know him.
- Who doesn'tt know this bastard?

551
01:07:08,042 --> 01:07:11,073
It lands on my little car, everyday.

552
01:07:11,074 --> 01:07:16,964
I'm pissed off . I'll send
this moron, to the madhouse.

553
01:07:16,965 --> 01:07:21,665
- I was dressing myself...
-Open the door. Let me see the damage.

554
01:07:21,666 --> 01:07:25,315
Look, the pervert!
What are you doing?

555
01:07:25,316 --> 01:07:29,460
What are you doing? Landing
is not enough? Also, want my wife?

556
01:07:31,461 --> 01:07:36,108
Get out of my car,
I'll kick your ass.

557
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:39,722
It's not only the car,
now, is also my wife.

558
01:07:41,423 --> 01:07:43,823
- Don't be jealous...
- Get out of my sight!

559
01:07:43,824 --> 01:07:48,373
My clothes. My clothes.
Don't throw them to the ground.

560
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:02,980
The situation is serious.
We must do something.

561
01:08:02,981 --> 01:08:07,978
Master, you don't trust me?
You don't think I can win?

562
01:08:07,979 --> 01:08:10,389
That's right.

563
01:08:11,390 --> 01:08:13,749
Master, we have always
the option of the killers.

564
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:18,854
- They just need your command.
- No. I have a better idea.

565
01:08:18,855 --> 01:08:19,830
Which?

566
01:08:29,831 --> 01:08:32,354
- Mr. Strozzi, please.
- Speaking.

567
01:08:32,355 --> 01:08:35,655
I wanted to ask you a favor.

568
01:09:21,656 --> 01:09:23,106
Just a minute, please.

569
01:09:34,651 --> 01:09:36,331
- May I come in?
- Please.

570
01:09:36,332 --> 01:09:39,238
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

571
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:43,515
What a beautiful home.
Worthy of you.

572
01:09:43,516 --> 01:09:49,339
- I'm glad you're doing well.
- I owe you a lot.

573
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:54,447
- Do not thank me, but you remember me?
- Of course, I do.

574
01:09:54,448 --> 01:10:00,523
- Remember we have a score to settle.
- Yes, I remember.

575
01:10:00,524 --> 01:10:05,115
- Remember this?
- This, not so much.

576
01:10:07,016 --> 01:10:09,628
- That I owed you this.
- These are some little arrears.

577
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:14,801
- Some little arrears that you owe me.
- Forgive me.

578
01:10:14,802 --> 01:10:20,038
- Which you're going to pay, right?
- I can't because I have no money...

579
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:25,893
But if you could take a little off,
you know,...no?

580
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:28,687
I'm going to work for the City Hall.

581
01:10:28,688 --> 01:10:30,205
- Forgive me.
- Please.

582
01:10:30,206 --> 01:10:36,064
- With which hand did you sign this bill?
- With this one.

583
01:10:37,065 --> 01:10:39,111
- Allow me?
- Be my guest. - Thank you.

584
01:10:45,112 --> 01:10:48,839
I am wretched, you know?

585
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:55,151
That cannibal would eat my whole hand.
How will I do the tournament now?

586
01:10:55,152 --> 01:11:00,329
Take it easy. Kung Fu is not everything
in life. You're overreacting.

587
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:04,525
Don't you see, one hand washes the other
and without them I don't know what to do.

588
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:09,266
Now with one hand, what do I do?
The other says, stop, stop!

589
01:11:09,267 --> 01:11:11,997
Okay,
I'm going to make a special treatment.

590
01:11:11,998 --> 01:11:14,761
At this point everyone
will be looking for me.

591
01:11:15,398 --> 01:11:21,913
Especially... my master,
if I don't show up, he'll be worried.

592
01:11:21,914 --> 01:11:24,302
Pity, after all that effort.

593
01:11:24,303 --> 01:11:26,156
After all that tiredness.

594
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:30,483
To him, my misfortune,
will be a big disappointment.

595
01:11:36,484 --> 01:11:39,504
- Murderer, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

596
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:41,514
This is acupuncture.

597
01:11:41,515 --> 01:11:44,418
To relieve pain
and the fever.

598
01:11:48,419 --> 01:11:51,273
Ormai, the vacancy
for the traffic warden is yours.

599
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,350
Basically,
you have no opponents.

600
01:11:54,385 --> 01:11:57,296
- Guaranteed you'll win.
- How do you know?

601
01:11:58,297 --> 01:12:02,575
It is true that I have no opponents.
I am Attila.

602
01:12:02,576 --> 01:12:05,265
And wherever I go,
everyone fears me.

603
01:12:09,102 --> 01:12:13,100
- Lately, have you been to my house?
- Yes, I have.

604
01:12:13,101 --> 01:12:18,022
- Without my order. - I stop there to...
- Do not do it anymore.

605
01:12:20,023 --> 01:12:23,478
What do I pay the gardener for?

606
01:12:25,127 --> 01:12:26,292
Excuse me, master?

607
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:29,750
Mr. Strozzi wants to talk to you.

608
01:12:29,751 --> 01:12:33,223
Come in Mr. Strozzi.

609
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:36,694
- What is the pleasure of your visit?
- Thank you.

610
01:12:37,695 --> 01:12:43,391
- I am honored with your visit.
- The honor is mine.

611
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:47,397
Mr. Strozzi was the one who got rid of
the "Hand of Travertine."

612
01:12:52,398 --> 01:12:55,945
No gentlemen,
I used an Italian method...

613
01:12:55,946 --> 01:12:59,325
that can destroy a man
or a nation.

614
01:12:59,326 --> 01:13:00,812
The protest!

615
01:13:01,513 --> 01:13:04,413
- A que devo a honra da sua visita?
- Ai, sim.

616
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:11,057
Glad to see you, but there is the issue
of the debt in protest.

617
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:16,281
Who will pay it now, since Franco
has been out of circulation?

618
01:13:16,282 --> 01:13:22,384
Do not worry.
Everything will be paid...

619
01:13:22,385 --> 01:13:25,697
and with interest.
Take him!

620
01:13:40,786 --> 01:13:44,740
No.
See what that cannibal did.

621
01:13:46,241 --> 01:13:48,041
Beautiful.
It is always a hand.

622
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:51,065
Yes, but I can't fight anymore.

623
01:13:51,066 --> 01:13:54,986
I feel the hand all sore.

624
01:13:54,987 --> 01:13:58,969
That old scrouge ruined me.

625
01:13:58,870 --> 01:13:59,907
See.

626
01:14:01,908 --> 01:14:06,120
If you really want to fight,
why don't you marry me?

627
01:14:06,121 --> 01:14:09,154
But that is another kind of combat,
you know?

628
01:14:09,155 --> 01:14:11,769
I prepared to win.

629
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:16,721
- You're going to win.
- Of course I will.

630
01:14:18,722 --> 01:14:21,928
- I'll help you.
- You, how?

631
01:14:41,152 --> 01:14:43,480
Master, where is your champion?

632
01:14:43,481 --> 01:14:46,575
- When will he get in the ring?
- He is coming.

633
01:14:46,576 --> 01:14:52,437
Master, I can't wait anymore. I am
obliged to give the victory to Attila.

634
01:14:53,438 --> 01:14:54,815
Be patient.

635
01:14:55,716 --> 01:14:57,261
- Then, I will continue.
- Yes, yes.

636
01:15:03,262 --> 01:15:05,537
Boys take this guy away,
we will continue.

637
01:15:05,538 --> 01:15:06,793
Attention please!

638
01:15:10,494 --> 01:15:11,867
Attila the Scourge.

639
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:16,251
The terror of the city
and countryside.

640
01:15:16,252 --> 01:15:20,195
will now face,
the opponent Renato,

641
01:15:20,196 --> 01:15:24,834
Chinese by birth
and Italian by adoption.

642
01:15:28,935 --> 01:15:33,102
There he is.
Applause. Applause.

643
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:40,966
Here is your opportunity
to compete in the tournament.

644
01:15:51,967 --> 01:15:53,474
We won the tournament!

645
01:16:04,475 --> 01:16:06,132
Master, when will he arrive?

646
01:16:06,133 --> 01:16:09,428
If there are no more opponents,
I'll give the victory to Attila.

647
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:14,011
Why do I have to go
through this situation?

648
01:16:21,012 --> 01:16:22,661
Finally, he arrived.

649
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,044
Now they are going to see
what he will do.

650
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,699
Go after him, go after him.

651
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:43,700
Go after him.

652
01:16:53,701 --> 01:16:58,208
You stay there.
And you there. Do we agree?

653
01:17:00,209 --> 01:17:03,314
The rules are to be followed.
No, to dirty tricks.

654
01:17:57,315 --> 01:17:58,719
Get back to him.

655
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:10,289
Franco, what do you do.
Use your head like Daddy.

656
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:26,002
Coward. You're worth nothing.
Go.

657
01:18:33,003 --> 01:18:37,287
Go Franco, hit him hard.
With the head like Daddy.

658
01:18:42,288 --> 01:18:43,441
Go Franco.

659
01:19:27,442 --> 01:19:28,879
Bravo!

660
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,054
Thank you Mr. kekkor.

661
01:20:08,055 --> 01:20:11,827
With this wig,
you gave me the possibility...

662
01:20:11,828 --> 01:20:13,828
to defeat the terrible Attila.

663
01:20:15,829 --> 01:20:18,169
You should have seen it.
How exciting.

664
01:20:18,170 --> 01:20:22,898
- Especially over Attila.
- That's why it is my treasure...

665
01:20:22,899 --> 01:20:26,689
my secret weapon.
When I don't have it I feel naked.

666
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:30,381
Truth is, without it I would not be able
to defend my interests.

667
01:20:30,379 --> 01:20:31,379
Mr. Kekkor.

668
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:34,526
- I'll show you my secret.
- Okay.

669
01:20:41,027 --> 01:20:42,349
This...

670
01:20:43,650 --> 01:20:45,050
is what made the difference.

671
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:49,973
Well thought, well thought.

672
01:20:51,074 --> 01:20:52,394
Let's toast to the victory.

673
01:21:00,395 --> 01:21:03,085
This is my wig.
Give it to me.

674
01:21:08,286 --> 01:21:13,086
Papa, cann't you walk.
Let me help you.

675
01:21:13,087 --> 01:21:16,261
Without the wig,
I'm nobody.

676
01:21:18,262 --> 01:21:23,201
At least give me moral support.
Beat them.

677
01:22:02,802 --> 01:22:04,690
- Daddy.
- Calm down.

678
01:22:08,691 --> 01:22:10,999
- Daddy.
- Wait, wait.

679
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,070
Some bread.

680
01:23:34,999 --> 01:23:37,842
The eels do not want to sleep...

681
01:23:37,843 --> 01:23:39,345
the crabs...

682
01:23:39,646 --> 01:23:46,208
There they are...
ready to get fun.

683
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:50,007
And now some flour...

684
01:23:50,008 --> 01:23:52,008
for a good baking.

685
01:23:54,009 --> 01:23:56,536
Flour from the best quality.

686
01:23:56,537 --> 01:24:00,405
How beautiful you are in white.

687
01:24:00,406 --> 01:24:02,417
You look like three ghosts.

688
01:24:05,418 --> 01:24:08,309
Genlemen...
may I have your attention.

689
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:11,087
Now we're going do get
a real headbutt.

690
01:24:12,617 --> 01:24:14,359
Yes....seriously.
Let's do the following.

691
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:18,729
I'll count  one, two, three,
and then you give a headbutt.

692
01:24:18,730 --> 01:24:20,497
Okay?
I'll be in the middle.

693
01:24:23,998 --> 01:24:25,091
One.

694
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:27,872
Two.

695
01:24:27,873 --> 01:24:29,219
Three.

696
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:42,469
Come, come celebrate the victory.

697
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:51,713
- Mr. Kekkor.
- What is it?

698
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:56,850
I want to ask your daughter's hand.

699
01:25:00,009 --> 01:25:02,944
As you wish,
you're too famous to be refused.

700
01:25:03,945 --> 01:25:06,486
- Do you allow?
- Yes.

701
01:25:07,487 --> 01:25:08,696
Daddy.

702
01:25:10,697 --> 01:25:11,806
Francoso.

703
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:16,585
Franco. Francoso, come here.
Give me a hug.

704
01:25:18,586 --> 01:25:19,856
- Ohhh, the briefcase.
- Dom Vito.

705
01:25:21,857 --> 01:25:22,950
- Who is this?
- Franco.

706
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:27,410
- I'm aware of your victory. Bravo!
Bang, bang!

707
01:25:27,411 --> 01:25:31,491
- You deserve a prize. A surprise.
- A surprise?

708
01:25:32,492 --> 01:25:34,492
Come in my darling.

709
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:37,562
Look, what a beauty, look.

710
01:25:38,563 --> 01:25:43,924
Francoso, this is the Imaculate flower
I promised you.

711
01:25:43,925 --> 01:25:45,306
My daughter.

712
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:49,376
Francoso, you deserve her.
It's your wife.

713
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:51,396
- Your wife?
- Who is this?

714
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:53,848
- Your husband.
- Husband, what husband?

715
01:25:56,090 --> 01:25:57,832
- I like this one. Go away.

716
01:25:57,833 --> 01:25:59,609
Come here, my treasure.

717
01:26:05,010 --> 01:26:08,610
- I like skinnies, but we'll manage it.
- Oh, my scatterbrained.

718
01:26:13,818 --> 01:26:16,111
Franco...
the time has come.

719
01:26:16,112 --> 01:26:18,258
- Here is the owner of Rome.
- What owner?

720
01:26:18,259 --> 01:26:20,438
No, the Presidente of Rome.

721
01:26:20,439 --> 01:26:23,162
- The Mayor of Rome.
- What a nonsense. What do you say?

722
01:26:23,163 --> 01:26:26,463
We got it.
My son.

723
01:26:28,011 --> 01:26:29,464
- Kiss the gentleman.
- Why?

724
01:26:29,465 --> 01:26:32,159
This gentleman is here
to confirm that you...

725
01:26:32,001 --> 01:26:35,234
are the winner
for the traffic warden's vacancy.

726
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:39,326
- Kiss him, kiss him.
- May I? - He's a bit shy.

727
01:26:44,326 --> 01:26:45,887
- You kissed the Mayor of Rome.
- I'm happy.

728
01:26:45,888 --> 01:26:48,914
- From now on, I'm your father.
- Why?

729
01:26:48,915 --> 01:26:54,953
By a chinese tradition,
a man who is a mentor of anoter man...

730
01:26:54,954 --> 01:26:57,825
who does everything for him
to become a man... - That's true.

731
01:26:57,826 --> 01:27:00,762
Therefore, becomes is father.

732
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:04,854
Thus, from now on you'll work for you
and take care of me, as well.

733
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:13,119
- I agree, but I'm going to marry her.
- What? Alright.

734
01:27:14,335 --> 01:27:19,657
- Yes, but you'll take care of me because
I'm your father. - The father is I!

735
01:27:19,658 --> 01:27:23,177
- What? I am the father.
- No, I am. - No, no, I am.

736
01:27:23,178 --> 01:27:26,086
- I am the father.  - The father is I.
- Excuse me, I am, not any of you.

737
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,087
- A stick for you, another for me
and we'll see who... - No, no.

738
01:28:10,088 --> 01:28:11,793
What you're doing
is against the law.

739
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:13,639
And you too.

740
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:15,970
- We're stoppped here and the officer
do nothing.  - Isn't that enough?

741
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:19,971
No, no.

742
01:28:21,972 --> 01:28:26,528
Don't recognise me, right?
Disturbing the public order?

743
01:28:27,883 --> 01:28:30,665
A thief of high caliber.
Once wanted to kill me.

744
01:28:32,666 --> 01:28:35,052
- Don't like it, right?
- No, no! I beg you!

745
01:28:40,401 --> 01:28:42,053
I'll give you
the strike of mercy.

746
01:29:50,201 --> 01:29:57,054
The END
