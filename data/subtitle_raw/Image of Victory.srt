00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,400
BASED ON HISTORICAL EVENTS

2
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,920
IMAGE OF VICTORY

3
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,280
There are moments when you are trying to
to find meaning in your life.

4
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,560
You wonder if you have made good use of
the time God has given you on earth.

5
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:45,600
You're looking for someone to compare yourself to.
With someone who has really lived.

6
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,160
Sometimes you are surprised by the one,
who comes to mind.

7
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:58,560
She is the one who came to mind.

8
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,720
Amazing.

9
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Of all the people,
I have met in my life,

10
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:11,600
It's her I don't know how to forget.

11
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:21,479
I know it doesn't make sense. Because he is the enemy.

12
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:29,400
But I can't erase
from my memory this image.

13
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,600
What made her smile?

14
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,280
Did she know it was about to happen?

15
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,040
Did she understand what I
have been searching for all my life?

16
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,040
After 30 years of bloody fighting, finally
a peace agreement will be signed

17
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:47,760
Between two countries:
Egypt and Israel.

18
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,680
The Egyptian president has taken the bold step of...

19
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,119
You dirty dog!

20
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,720
For years, we fought against Israel,
to help our Palestinian brothers.

21
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,160
This agreement will not change anything.

22
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,840
- Sadat is a traitor, and I am a coward.
- Hassanin, what is going on?

23
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,720
Are you still concerned?

24
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,920
Dinner is ready.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
If there was no reason for war,
and they sign a peace treaty from such....

26
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,879
It was for years that I misled
people who read my articles.

27
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:26,600
I told them that war is just.

28
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,560
And they fought and died.

29
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,200
If their deaths were unnecessary,

30
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,959
Who is to blame for this?

31
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,720
Who's who!

32
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,119
Me!

33
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,160
Now I should tell them,
That our president is a traitor.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,400
If only I wasn't such a
coward, if I wasn't so afraid....

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,479
You wrote about what you believed in.

36
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
About the king and the homeland.

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,080
You are the best Egyptian journalist.
An oak tree breaks during a storm,

38
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,119
And the bamboo will bend,
And then it will straighten out again.

39
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:07,360
Let's eat.

40
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Bent bamboo. Is that what I have become?

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,640
Pathetic.

42
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,560
I think back to her,
To what she dared to do.

43
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,479
What does this say about me?
What should I do?

44
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,840
When I was 24 years old,
I wasn't afraid of anything.

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,760
On the last night of 1947.

46
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,239
HAPPY NEW YEAR 1948!

47
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:19,320
But the crowd. Come on, it's in the cinema hall.

48
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,239
He ordered to bring you in.

49
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,840
What's the job? Why the mysteries?

50
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:28,760
You will soon find out.
You like movies, don't you?

51
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,119
Yes, but what are the secrets?

52
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,959
The manufacturer will explain to you.

53
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:40,680
EGYPTIAN NEWS REVIEW

54
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,879
As every year, there was a
charity banquet in Cairo.

55
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,400
The people's beloved King Faruk

56
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,879
He visited backstage with the dancers,

57
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,160
Who entertained the distinguished guests.

58
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
Turn it off. What are you doing?

59
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,239
Showing the king,
As he flirts with the dancers?

60
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,160
Is the queen supposed to watch this?

61
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,800
The king cares about charity,
not the dancers.

62
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,600
Do you hear?

63
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,720
Sorry.

64
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,400
Do you want them to shut us down? Start thinking.

65
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,680
Sorry. You wanted to
to see my friend. It's urgent.

66
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,160
Is he the one who writes for newspapers?

67
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:39,360
Yes, but his passion is cinema.

68
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:42,520
Is he brave?

69
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,080
What's your name?

70
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,680
Hassanin.

71
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
Documents.

72
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,239
The Zionists are savage beasts.
They deserve retaliation.

73
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,439
I know Jews, they have unbridled ambition.

74
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,040
They consider it the land of their ancestors.

75
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:26,400
They came to Palestine from many directions.
From Europe, South America, Asia.

76
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,920
They are like a pestilence bearing down on us.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,760
How will they get rid of us?

78
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,479
Arabs have lived in these lands for centuries.

79
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,760
Foreigners are colonizing our holy
Land by getting rid of our brothers.

80
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,720
Take a look.

81
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,479
From the quiet village of Hamama,
Along the road between Gaza and Tel Aviv.

82
00:07:55,119 --> 00:07:58,360
These dog sons built the Nitzanim colony.

83
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,320
In Nitzani,

84
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,080
as I later learned, lived
a girl with a mysterious smile.

85
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,560
I had never heard of this place.

86
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,600
That evening I was fascinated by the passion of the

87
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,560
As well as the ideological fever
of young volunteers.

88
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,720
It showed battlefield situations,
Which were later made into films.

89
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,040
At first, the thought of war
was terrifying,

90
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,360
But for me it was an opportunity.

91
00:08:32,439 --> 00:08:36,640
I was able to indulge my passion - cinema.

92
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:42,840
Tolstoy wrote,
That love and fear are inseparable.

93
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,680
He must not be allowed to
run in front of the trucks.

94
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,720
You are supposed to behave
Like soldiers, not like hooligans!

95
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,439
Dani! We are racing!

96
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,840
We'll see who gets the gifts first.

97
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:40,119
I don't know which
Is more childish.

98
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,160
There should be a child.
A child mother is dangerous.

99
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,360
- Who missed more?
- Me!

100
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:57,360
- Which ladies want to go back to the box?
- Who do you call a maiden?

101
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:02,439
Elyakim? Did you get the book
About Holstein cows?

102
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,600
Have a weapon with you.

103
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,479
We are supposed to protect these people.

104
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,280
Romek!

105
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,400
Why did they send us
These area men straight from prison?

106
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:28,840
- Will we file a complaint?
- We won't.

107
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,000
Better such than none at all.

108
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,479
Naomi, bring mattresses for the soldiers.

109
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Listen up if you want a place to sleep!

110
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,080
Take a bag

111
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,400
And fill it with hay.

112
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,920
You will make a mattress.

113
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,879
Tie at the end,
so the hay doesn't come out.

114
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,680
Keep your belongings under your underwear.

115
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,040
I would love to put something under her underwear.

116
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,920
- Have you ever been with a redhead?
- It glows in the dark.

117
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,959
- Her hair or the lice?
- Sorry.

118
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:23,360
I used to play the violin,
I have perfect hearing. Like a dog.

119
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,479
- He also barks like a dog.
- I said enough!

120
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,640
The sea is about a kilometer away.

121
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,239
Do you want to take a bath in winter, crazy?

122
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,320
No, the coast is 50 kilometers to Tel Aviv.

123
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,239
- We were already in jail for desertion.
- Wasn't it worth it?

124
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,040
The commander can
Contact the battalion?

125
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,920
- Sure.
- Why didn't they give you a radio?

126
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,479
It wasn't. We can handle it.

127
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,720
- With whom?
- With the battalion commander.

128
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,040
Bright. I have a carburetor waiting for me
from the tractor. I'm going.

129
00:12:10,119 --> 00:12:10,959
Right.

130
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Don't stand, sit down.

131
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,840
Iron Gate, this is Sparrow, can you hear me?

132
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,560
Your son?

133
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,879
Nice.

134
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,840
He has grown up and is independent.

135
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:45,360
Do you like?

136
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:46,959
What?

137
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,840
Marlene Dietrich.

138
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,160
I rarely go to the movies.

139
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,640
- Do you listen to records on the turntable?
- In the dining room.

140
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,680
I can't feel my legs.

141
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,760
It hurts a lot! I can't stand it.

142
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,560
Stay there, we will distract them.

143
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:29,840
Fire!

144
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,560
To attack!

145
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,760
- At our place peace and quiet!
- Here too!

146
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,400
Habani, notified,
That the wounded must be evacuated.

147
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:01,879
The hospital is on the first floor.

148
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,600
Tie the body to a tree,
To deter other killers?

149
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,600
It's not a killer,

150
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,879
is still a child.

151
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,320
Some are skilled in the use of weapons,

152
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,720
But we still don't have enough people,
to keep guard and work in the field.

153
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,520
This is just the beginning.

154
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,400
Today we are attacked by farmers,
tomorrow it could be worse.

155
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,600
You need to bring food to the guards.
Who will take care of it?

156
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,360
Me.

157
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,840
Habani, come with me.

158
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,000
What about the supply of weapons?

159
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,360
It is still missing.

160
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,000
Eight cows equals 42 gallons
of milk per day? 34 for sale.

161
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,119
To make money,
you must have a hundred gallons a day.

162
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,520
It is impossible to keep children
in such a dangerous place.

163
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,720
Without children, there is no life.

164
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
Doctor!

165
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,920
Lives.

166
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,439
Surprised I didn't kill him?

167
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,320
Even a blind hen will get
a seed sometimes.

168
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,840
Bravo, doctor! Great job!

169
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,520
Ziggy?

170
00:15:48,119 --> 00:15:49,840
Play as in Berlin.

171
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,760
Play for them.

172
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,200
- I don't want to disturb them.
- In what?

173
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,479
You said you miss the piano.
Play it. But modern.

174
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,640
Ziggy? More modern.

175
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,439
Decadent music here?

176
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,720
Sorry, this is not a nightclub.

177
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,720
Sorry, but music is music.
We will not ban it.

178
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,520
I'm not banning, but it's not our style.

179
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,520
- It's boring.
- But also important.

180
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,280
Excuse me, shall we dance?

181
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,320
Are we dancing?

182
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,080
I am a gentleman.

183
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,600
Kilometer, will you allow?

184
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,479
I want to dance a little.

185
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,760
Your name is Kilometer? Why?

186
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,920
It weighs a kilogram and measures a meter.

187
00:17:42,879 --> 00:17:44,320
Ben Gigi, don't you dance?

188
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,959
Sgt. Ben Gigi.

189
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,479
We were neighbors, but here I am

190
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,959
Sgt. Ben Gigi or Sir.

191
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,239
Is that clear?

192
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,800
Get back to work.

193
00:17:58,879 --> 00:18:03,200
- Shall we dance?
- I don't dance with animals.

194
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,439
With animals?

195
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,640
Yes, are you Jamus?

196
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:10,320
In Arabic, it means ox.

197
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,200
That is, you are an animal.

198
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:30,320
- It's time.
- For what?

199
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
Sleep.

200
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,040
- Ask Hadassa to finish.
- Don't.

201
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,200
- He dances with this soldier.
- And what?

202
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,840
Always looking for trouble. Always.

203
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:48,640
Radio Alexandria here.

204
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,840
Cigarette?

205
00:18:53,439 --> 00:18:58,320
- Thank you, Mr. Hassanin.
- Just Hassanin, without you.

206
00:19:02,479 --> 00:19:07,840
Have you seen Capra's "Why We Fight" videos?

207
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:13,119
I work all day. I support my family.

208
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,879
Capra will be our inspiration.

209
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:23,040
We will show simple people,
Who are fighting a just war.

210
00:19:23,479 --> 00:19:26,600
We will shoot the news,

211
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:32,600
Which doesn't mean,
That it can't also be art.

212
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:38,320
We will show the human fate.

213
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,320
Are you okay?

214
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,320
Dreams...

215
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,239
We drove at night,
So that no one could see us.

216
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,439
We were to split up
and attack from cover.

217
00:20:16,439 --> 00:20:17,479
Good morning.

218
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,000
Forgive me for waking you up.

219
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,320
I'm going to the city, coming back tomorrow.

220
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,080
Should I bring you something?

221
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,280
Enjoy your trip.

222
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,000
Mira...

223
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,320
Give me a break.

224
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,520
I want you to hug me.

225
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,000
As it used to be.

226
00:20:54,239 --> 00:20:56,680
Stop. You know we don't... anymore.

227
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,360
Should I pretend?

228
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
To be insincere?

229
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,840
Sorry.
I'll tell you if I feel something again.

230
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,959
- I don't know what to do.
- Me too.

231
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,720
You told me not to do anything.

232
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,520
That I would behave,
As if nothing had changed, but....

233
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,680
What happened?

234
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,119
What's the problem?

235
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,680
I don't blame you,

236
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,200
But what has changed?

237
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,560
I don't know.

238
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,000
You know that you are important to me.

239
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,520
It doesn't matter who attacks you.
Size doesn't matter.

240
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,560
Habani, enough jokes.

241
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,920
Did you understand? Do you need me to show again?

242
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:55,439
I'm easy to flip because I don't defend myself.

243
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,320
Okay, hit me up.

244
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,160
- For real?
- Yes.

245
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,879
Use his power against him.

246
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,400
Again, but more slowly.

247
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,080
Do you have someone in mind?

248
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
- I think no.
- Don't think too much.

249
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:17,239
- Easy for you to say.
- Why?

250
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,239
Because you are Mira.

251
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,920
Which is to say?

252
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,800
Stop.

253
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,840
Romek, wait! You have to practice.

254
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,879
We'll do just that...

255
00:22:28,959 --> 00:22:30,520
Jamus, this is not a brothel!

256
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,360
As the leader here you give the orders

257
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:37,920
- And assign tasks?
- This is not the military, there are no orders.

258
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
At the meetings we jointly
we make decisions.

259
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,800
Who decides on security issues?

260
00:22:42,879 --> 00:22:45,000
What is it, general?

261
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,840
About Mira.

262
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,680
I know the radio belongs to the kibbutz,
But we need it for operations.

263
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:55,439
- What kind?
- Such as in this Arab village.

264
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,680
You need a radio,
But not girls, correct?

265
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,800
I wish you the best of luck.

266
00:23:02,879 --> 00:23:03,760
I don't understand.

267
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,959
You'll understand.

268
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,840
Mira is different, unique.

269
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,439
I still don't get it.

270
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,879
You will see.

271
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,119
It's raining terribly.

272
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,600
I knocked, no one answered, so I'm waiting.

273
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,520
Elyakim has left,
and Dani is sleeping in the nursery.

274
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,720
Not with you and your husband?

275
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,800
These are the rules on the kibbutz. Will you come in?

276
00:23:32,879 --> 00:23:35,479
- I don't want to disturb you.
- Take it easy.

277
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,040
Coffee?

278
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,200
Don't.

279
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,400
I plan to check
the area of the village opposite.

280
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,400
There are no soldiers there, so there should not
be problems, but a radio will come in handy.

281
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:09,320
Right. I like people with foresight.

282
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:14,239
I need your radio.

283
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,879
Just in case.

284
00:24:19,479 --> 00:24:20,760
Bright.

285
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:23,119
Great.

286
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,479
- Will you give them to me?
- I will go with you.

287
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,760
- Mira.
- No.

288
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,760
- If necessary, I will confiscate them.
- You can't.

289
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,560
It is the property of the kibbutz.

290
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,920
You have to bear with me.

291
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,320
Is it that difficult?

292
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,800
At night we reached the village of Hamama.
Our commander Halif began to plan the attack.

293
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,840
He was the only real soldier
among the volunteers.

294
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,000
An interesting character. Educated
and overzealous at the same time.

295
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,600
The people of the village
were glad to see us.

296
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:19,080
They were counting on us to help them return
to the lands they had been farming.

297
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:24,000
I figured I would find interesting
human dramas to film.

298
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,360
You stick the bayonet in and pull it out.

299
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,800
Who ever killed a ram?

300
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,840
It's the same thing, but no wool.

301
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,040
Salman, your turn.

302
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,640
Do you want to tickle him or kill him?

303
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,280
If you want to play,
I will bring you dogs.

304
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,720
I joked.

305
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,720
Who's next?

306
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,040
Come.

307
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,560
Youssef, take a look at him,
he is photogenic.

308
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,680
Make an effort. Stand up as you should!

309
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,720
Stronger. Bring it on!

310
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,360
Which is to say?

311
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,080
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

312
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,400
- Now?
- Yes.

313
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,400
Right.

314
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,800
We were to tell
about the liberation of Palestinian lands.

315
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:32,040
But each story consists of
of side stories.

316
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,840
Already in the first week we noticed,

317
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,439
That a
a beautiful tale of love.

318
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,000
This road is located
On the outskirts of the town.

319
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,400
Near the Isdud Bridge is a military camp.

320
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,119
From there, they send supplies to Nitzanim.

321
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:58,000
And what they produce there,
is shipped to Tel Aviv.

322
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,640
We divine emissaries,

323
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,720
We will make life difficult for them soon.

324
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,560
Sorry, but it stinks
More than dirty diapers.

325
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:08,840
File a complaint against them. They will be peeled off.

326
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,040
They are little boys,
don't pay attention to them.

327
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,360
It's a nightmare.

328
00:28:13,439 --> 00:28:16,920
After cleaning the toilets recently, I couldn't
get rid of the stench from my hair

329
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,439
- And I went to take a bath.
- Great idea.

330
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,920
Why don't we go to the beach after work?
We'll take a swim.

331
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,360
I do not understand why they do not send
us mines. We don't have enough of them.

332
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,320
In the afternoon we are going to the beach,
So if you need a radio,

333
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,160
get them.

334
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:49,360
Upon my return, I want to get them back.

335
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:53,119
- Do you have someone trained?
- Yes.

336
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,760
Communicate to him that it is delicate.

337
00:28:57,479 --> 00:28:59,720
One must be careful.

338
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,959
I'll see if they dig. Whether they dig deep enough.

339
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,280
What?

340
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,879
No matter.

341
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,119
Anything else?

342
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,800
You did not answer,
Whether you will return the radio in time.

343
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:29,360
You are so difficult.

344
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:31,000
You do.

345
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,000
What will it be like?

346
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,280
Do you often go to the beach these days?

347
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,720
Yes, why?

348
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,560
I will send people with you, just in case.

349
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,959
Will our children be taught Spanish?

350
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,680
Our culture?

351
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,879
We will be able to talk to them
in case of problems,

352
00:30:09,959 --> 00:30:11,879
And our husbands won't understand us.

353
00:30:11,959 --> 00:30:15,439
No problems,
we will have wonderful husbands.

354
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:38,720
Isn't the water cold this time of year?

355
00:30:39,439 --> 00:30:41,479
Cold water stimulates circulation.

356
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,760
What is this strange word?

357
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,760
It's all about blood circulation.

358
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,879
Again, he provokes.

359
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,400
Any problem?

360
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,680
God help.

361
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,280
Won't you take a bath?

362
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,720
- We didn't take bathing suits.
- What do you guys need them for? Do you have socks?

363
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Roll them up and place them in the appropriate
place, and then tie with a rubber band.

364
00:31:19,479 --> 00:31:20,360
Are you kidding?

365
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:23,800
No. Whatever you want, the water is great.

366
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:26,119
Mira is crazy.

367
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,400
Why? It's funny.

368
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,119
Do you want to watch them naked? That's disgusting.

369
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:48,320
Sock? What do you think?

370
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,479
Speechless.

371
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,879
- Don't you take a bath?
- I don't give a damn.

372
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,360
Mira, wait!

373
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,840
Are you ashamed of your little bird?

374
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,479
- Stupid.
- Don't be ashamed.

375
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,119
You can use children's socks.

376
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,840
Should I leave my gun here?

377
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,439
- Have you started following orders?
- That's not the point.

378
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,720
That is, you have a little one.

379
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,520
- This is your chance, my friend.
- Get unstuck.

380
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,840
Dive in, the water is not cold.

381
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,800
You are idiots.

382
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,760
Complete morons.

383
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,280
For water.

384
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,879
Little Brain.

385
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:48,879
The little prick!

386
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,840
- Come on!
- Don't.

387
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,680
Come on!

388
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,479
Hello ladies.

389
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,160
Is the water too cold?

390
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:19,239
For you, too?

391
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,119
Stop it, crazy person!

392
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,520
Enough! Calm down! Where are you going?

393
00:33:28,879 --> 00:33:32,800
Ada, help me, we will water it.

394
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:35,320
I thought you had better taste.

395
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,000
Stop, it's just a game.

396
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,040
A normal boy doesn't pick up like that.

397
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,680
Are you having a good time?

398
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,439
Yes.

399
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,520
For the first time since I've been in the army.

400
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,000
It's paradise.

401
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,119
Paradise.

402
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,280
It would have been, had we not been threatened with death.

403
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:16,920
As the poet said?
He who fears death, fears life.

404
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,280
Cheap Romanticism.

405
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,920
Get down! Don't you understand?

406
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,680
It's not a movie, it's really happening.

407
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,320
Fire!

408
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,080
Come on out!

409
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,760
Hurry! Hurry up!

410
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,239
Elyakim, where did the shots come from?

411
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,600
Kilometer, hurry up! Quickly!

412
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,000
I'm coming, cover me!

413
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,239
Jamil, hit him!

414
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,879
- It's a trap!
- I know what to do.

415
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,280
What do you do?

416
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,200
Why do you make them thieves?
They don't steal, they are heroes.

417
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,320
I know, but heroes have to eat too.
Carrying food makes them human.

418
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,239
A waste of time. Salman, hurry up.

419
00:37:26,879 --> 00:37:29,200
We're moving, fast.

420
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,320
Ben Gigi to the right, Kilometer to the left.

421
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,879
Mosco!

422
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,640
Better not.

423
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,080
How are we supposed to work,
When they keep shooting at us?

424
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,040
Who is supposed to stop them?
Twelve soldiers? Is this a joke?

425
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,680
Yes, but a poor one. Are we idealists?

426
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,520
Sure.

427
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,920
You have to protect us.

428
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,720
We have children.

429
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,760
You are all important to us.

430
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,320
We placed mines on both sides.

431
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,680
I say. Wait, I say.

432
00:38:41,959 --> 00:38:46,879
I will say what everyone knows,
But are afraid to say.

433
00:38:46,959 --> 00:38:50,400
We know what commanders Avidan and Kovner are.

434
00:38:50,479 --> 00:38:55,439
The situation is obvious.
A political officer, that is, a real chief...

435
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,879
Who is a political officer?

436
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,080
They have such in the Russian army.

437
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,160
This is someone who has more power
authority than the commanders.

438
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,360
He works for the government and knows its plans.

439
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:14,239
- They don't care about us one bit.
- I think it's not about politics.

440
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,840
It's nice that you think so,
But this is about our children.

441
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,320
You don't have to speak in such a tone.

442
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,400
I say as I wish.

443
00:39:23,479 --> 00:39:26,520
It's about the lives of our children, not cows.

444
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,840
- Good evening.
- Hi.

445
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,959
Are you all right?

446
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,239
They are in the room, debating.

447
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,600
What about the cows?

448
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,479
How so?

449
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,840
Someone has to replace Mosco.

450
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:14,600
You are alone, and we have a lot of heifers.

451
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,920
You need a woman.

452
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,800
One that has experience with children.

453
00:40:21,879 --> 00:40:26,600
Stop, you just
man died, have you forgotten?

454
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,239
Tomorrow you will not have
someone to help with the milking.

455
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,439
You need someone to help you.

456
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:37,160
It's Kovner.

457
00:40:37,959 --> 00:40:40,000
Evening.

458
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,160
We asked for weapons and what?
We didn't get one.

459
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,879
We asked for soldiers and what?
We got one measly platoon.

460
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:55,600
- Deserters and thieves.
- Insult me, not my soldiers.

461
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,000
These traps are just the beginning.

462
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:03,239
First they were farmers, now they are
trained volunteers with weapons.

463
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,439
What are you going to do about it?

464
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:10,320
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,
or maybe next week,

465
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,160
If weather permits, meals will arrive.

466
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:20,479
And by then they will have killed us?
What will that take care of?

467
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,360
Is the solution revenge?
Understand, these lands belonged to them....

468
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:28,920
All the lands belonged
once belonged to someone else.

469
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,959
Also to you.
Such arguments will not change anything.

470
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,400
We paid a lot of money
To the owner of the land.

471
00:41:37,479 --> 00:41:42,600
Farmers should be angry
At him, not at you.

472
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,959
When we were burned in the crematoria,

473
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,920
some of you know very well,
what I am talking about,

474
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,119
we understood, with all due respect
For culture and civilization,

475
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,040
That humans are also animals.

476
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,040
And animals respond to "an eye for an eye."

477
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:04,800
Elyakim.

478
00:42:04,879 --> 00:42:07,800
You will return with us to Be'er Tuvia by truck.

479
00:42:07,879 --> 00:42:11,080
We are reloading what is left there.

480
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,720
But will go with you
An armed armored car.

481
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,200
From now on, it will always be like this.

482
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,879
- The matter is settled.
- He agrees.

483
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:24,640
If we give up, we'll be thrown out there,

484
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,959
Where six million Jews lost their lives.

485
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:41,360
Are you okay?

486
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,160
- Yes.
- Don't be ashamed.

487
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,280
Anyone would be horrified by the sight of a
of a friend being killed.

488
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,080
I am not afraid or ashamed.
Everything is fine.

489
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,800
- Good evening.
- Hi.

490
00:43:19,479 --> 00:43:22,400
Look at him hugging his teddy bear.

491
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,119
Don't wake him up.

492
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,840
I want to hear him mumble.

493
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,720
- He has such a sweet little voice.
- Yes.

494
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,640
Sometimes he says to the bear. It's cute.

495
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,720
- Sweet?
- Yes.

496
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:42,360
You rarely use the word.

497
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,720
Dear Child.

498
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:28,160
Forgive me, I forgot the book.

499
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,959
But it's nothing important, I'll leave you alone.

500
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,640
All right, they're waiting for me.

501
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:39,160
Tell him that I kissed him
And that I will bring him many gifts.

502
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,320
I'll be back in a few days. Bye.

503
00:44:47,959 --> 00:44:49,640
Hadasa, wait.

504
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,360
You do well with your children.

505
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,640
Yerach will now be alone in the barn
with the cows. He won't be able to cope alone.

506
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,800
Why don't you try working there?

507
00:45:06,879 --> 00:45:10,400
If you like it, you'll stay.

508
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:19,520
Good evening. I'm here to pick up the radio.

509
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,200
- I don't want to upset you...
- But you do.

510
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,680
- Sorry. If there is an evacuation....
- I will not move from here.

511
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,879
- I am responsible for you.
- I will not move from here.

512
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,520
- You are a mother.
- You know a lot.

513
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,600
Just like Elyakim,
Who whined about it before leaving.

514
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:47,680
We need to figure out something together about the radio.

515
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:52,640
You went on patrol without him.

516
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:55,840
You took unnecessary risks.

517
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:00,680
You hoped the battalion would send you a radio,
but that didn't happen.

518
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,800
Therefore, I will lend you a radio.
Provided,

519
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:08,239
That you will take me with you. Agreed?

520
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,600
A week has passed,

521
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,760
Then another, then two more,

522
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,600
and we had nothing to film.

523
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,400
Good morning.

524
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,200
Lt. Halif hoped,
That the Jews would start attacking,

525
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,119
That's why he set traps.

526
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,160
But the Jews did not attack.

527
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:03,239
Why was there nothing to film?
Why were there no traps?

528
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:09,600
Because the truck was guarded by an armored car.
He accompanied them always.

529
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:14,840
I watched their colony out of boredom.

530
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,080
She seemed normal.

531
00:47:18,479 --> 00:47:23,640
When you perceive in the enemy
an ordinary person, something shifts in your mind.

532
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,640
Since my boss and producer
Was happy with the trap film,

533
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,360
I decided that I would focus
on the daily lives of our heroes.

534
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,959
And I will show the forming love story.

535
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,479
This is the story of a brave soldier
Salman and Samira, a beautiful village girl.

536
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,840
What's up?

537
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:59,280
What kind of nonsense is this?
Has he gone completely insane?

538
00:48:01,239 --> 00:48:06,560
- Who cares about these rants?
- He thought it might be interesting.

539
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,479
I don't pay him to think,
just for filming the war.

540
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:15,760
I want the kind of videos,
that he sent me two weeks ago.

541
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,800
The audience does not want a story about love.

542
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,160
If he doesn't like it, we'll say goodbye.

543
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:29,800
Is there a post office in the village?

544
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:33,879
No, but it's not far away, in Khan Yunis.

545
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,239
Send him a telegram.

546
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,760
Let the letter carrier get
on a bicycle, or a donkey

547
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,640
and takes it to the hands of
our director.

548
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,320
I will also write to Colonel Aziz.
I will ask him to send them reinforcements.

549
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,640
Maybe with this we will see some progress
and there will be something to film.

550
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,439
So good. Keep digging until I say stop.

551
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,479
Come on!

552
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:52,760
Good. Jump.
Kilometer, where are you? Practice.

553
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,479
- This is not a good idea.
- I want to give it a try.

554
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:01,360
If I don't like it,
I'll be back in a few days.

555
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,239
Good morning.

556
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,080
Welcome.

557
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:33,040
I am supposed to work here today.

558
00:50:33,879 --> 00:50:34,920
Are you okay?

559
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,280
They were supposed to send me someone,
But I didn't know who.

560
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:40,239
Bright.

561
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:45,000
Remember that here work
starts early in the morning.

562
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:50,920
The cows are full of milk and their udders hurt.

563
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:58,080
Just like with a baby.

564
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,200
It hurts not you, me.

565
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,479
But I don't have a child.
There are a lot of them in the children's ward.

566
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,040
There is a child here, too.

567
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,000
How cute.

568
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:30,840
Milking consists of two steps.

569
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,080
The first is.

570
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,119
udder massage.

571
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,760
Massage?

572
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:45,000
Yes, take a look. Do you see?

573
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,160
To stimulate the milk stream.

574
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,720
The milk flows straight from the...

575
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,760
nipple.

576
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,560
Do you know what it is?

577
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:01,239
I know what a nipple is.

578
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:07,920
You need to press it,
to stimulate the flow of milk.

579
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,680
Forgive me, it's certainly unpleasant.

580
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,760
Why. Massaging, stimulating.

581
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,479
Sounds pleasant.

582
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:20,400
For the cow.

583
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,439
Here, quickly.

584
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,320
Open.

585
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,959
Kilometer, hurry up.

586
00:53:36,879 --> 00:53:38,200
Evening.

587
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:45,040
Can I ask you something?

588
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,720
What do you want?

589
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,560
We want to go with you,
To film everything up close.

590
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,720
I don't care,
whether you will be filming

591
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:00,520
From near or far.

592
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,200
Sorry, but there's a big difference.

593
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,360
The story has the same
significance as action.

594
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:12,479
That's what the cowards in Cairo say.

595
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,879
That's what cowards say.

596
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:25,239
Cowards don't go after soldiers.

597
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,560
The camera is also a weapon.

598
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,080
Even on the eve of Passover
They don't serve decent food.

599
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:37,000
No cutlery. Do they have us as animals?

600
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,080
Kilometer, sit next to me.

601
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:42,959
When the party starts,
you are supposed to load your machine gun.

602
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,879
Remember, when the
shooting, I'll be vomiting.

603
00:54:47,959 --> 00:54:51,200
- I can get you dirty...
- Stop. Grow up.

604
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,920
Garnet and smoke grenade.

605
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,800
Youssef?

606
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:10,840
Should I take up arms?

607
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,239
Just in case.

608
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,800
With a gun, don't stand behind the cameraman,
because you might kill him.

609
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:20,920
The poor man has children.

610
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,959
It will be better for him,
If you don't take up arms.

611
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:33,959
Once the shooting starts,
we can't stop.

612
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,800
If someone gets tired, he will rest
In a hideout, before shooting.

613
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,280
Ladies...

614
00:55:44,439 --> 00:55:46,560
It will be like this...

615
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,320
- Why ladies?
- What.

616
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,520
- Because you are a woman.
- You say it in such a tone....

617
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,720
I didn't mean to offend anyone.
I always say that.

618
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,840
You have to keep watch on the water tower.

619
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,520
Those at the bottom will run with the news.
Good luck.

620
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,720
Weapons at the ready.
Quiet now, we are close.

621
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,680
They are about 40 meters from the fence.

622
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:36,879
Fire!

623
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,400
It's me, Salman! I got hit, help!

624
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
I am injured.

625
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,720
Help! It's me, Salman. Help!

626
00:58:32,879 --> 00:58:34,360
Are we winning?

627
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,879
Shoot accurately, don't waste bullets.
We have a long day ahead of us.

628
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,879
Salman, rest assured, it's just a scratch.

629
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:15,280
Jamil, take six men
and go after them from the beach.

630
00:59:17,479 --> 00:59:19,640
Do you have a wire cutter?

631
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:37,200
Hadasa!

632
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,680
- What do we do?
- Follow me.

633
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,479
Iron Gate, here Sparrow.
Phase 2, repeat, Phase 2.

634
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,119
Confirmed, receipt.

635
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,000
They go here. They are close by.

636
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,760
Right away.

637
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,920
Fire!

638
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,280
Habani, hurry up.

639
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,040
I'm in a hurry.

640
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,400
This is where we take shelter before we set off the charge.

641
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,879
Habani, the detonator.

642
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,200
Attention.

643
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,640
Done.

644
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,720
I don't know what happened. We are withdrawing.

645
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,600
It was hard to watch
at these brave volunteers

646
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:06,119
lying on hospital beds.
Especially since there was a shortage of drugs and morphine.

647
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:15,600
The saddest were the farmers,
who were expelled from the lands of the Nitzanim region.

648
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:22,400
They thought they would soon regain
their lives and return home.

649
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,640
Hope disappeared very quickly.

650
01:02:33,400 --> 01:02:37,040
I heard that in the platoon that
had broken through to the village,

651
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,600
was a woman. Just as
courageous as the men.

652
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,200
I myself almost lost
my hero Salman.

653
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,239
Fortunately, his wound was superficial.

654
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,840
There is no drama without a hero.

655
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:03,119
Lieutenant Halif urged me to
send a telegram to my producer,

656
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,000
In which I will notify him,
That the film was lost during the fighting.

657
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,400
He was afraid they would blame him for the failure.

658
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:16,640
I told him that it was not his fault,
But I can't send such a telegram.

659
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,640
I have to show the truth.

660
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,320
I won't forget it for you.

661
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,040
You are a traitor.

662
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,720
If it's a weapon, as you said,
then this weapon you are directing against me.

663
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,119
I send what I filmed.

664
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:38,040
Maybe this will make them understand,
That we need help.

665
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:40,239
I'm not doing this against you.

666
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,400
Let's go.

667
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:46,439
Come.

668
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,600
Gentlemen,

669
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:21,119
If the Jews declare independence today,

670
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:24,959
We must send our troops immediately.

671
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:29,800
Our volunteers alone cannot
can handle their army.

672
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,400
It's a difficult situation, the king is worried.

673
01:04:33,479 --> 01:04:35,560
Please forgive the frankness,

674
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:42,640
But the Egyptians will come out as weaklings
and cowards if they don't help their brothers.

675
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,320
The generals told the king
about what they saw on the video.

676
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,280
Fearing a reaction from the people, the king
ordered that all copies of the film be burned.

677
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:59,200
He also ordered preparations to invade
against Israel within two months.

678
01:05:08,479 --> 01:05:09,760
I understand you.

679
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:14,040
The creation of a state surrounded
by enemies is frightening.

680
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:16,439
In cities far away from each other,

681
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:20,080
Yad Mordechai, Nitzanim,
Kfar Darom, people talk about....

682
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,239
I have a hard time pronouncing the word.

683
01:05:22,879 --> 01:05:23,760
On evacuation.

684
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,800
What kind of evacuation are they talking about?

685
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:29,879
If we start it, how will it end?

686
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:34,760
It will spread
And the whole south will evacuate.

687
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,200
Then panic will sweep the north.

688
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,760
Do you want to evacuate Rehovot,
Rishon LeZion? Tel Aviv?

689
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,040
Where do we go from here?

690
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,080
- Let's hurry up.
- What did they say?

691
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,680
No evacuation, just children.

692
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:51,920
And the mothers?

693
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,760
- It is their choice. Let's help them.
- Wait.

694
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:57,720
And the meals?

695
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:01,239
They can send reserve reinforcements,
if necessary.

696
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:06,959
They figured that the Egyptians would head
toward the bridge and ignore the villages.

697
01:06:07,439 --> 01:06:09,800
Weapons? Mines?

698
01:06:10,879 --> 01:06:12,479
- Will they be?
- A little.

699
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,040
Anti-tank launcher.

700
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,280
- Did you argue?
- As much as I could.

701
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:21,239
But not all arguments can be won.

702
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:31,640
What?

703
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,920
Nothing. Sing.

704
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,840
Are these songs from the past?

705
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:40,000
You put me to shame.

706
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:42,720
Me?

707
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:54,800
Caution.

708
01:06:56,280 --> 01:06:57,439
Pardon.

709
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,800
Because of you I have a mouth full of sand.

710
01:07:11,879 --> 01:07:14,360
No harm done,
you always have a mouth full of pigs.

711
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:40,879
For now.

712
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,600
General? What do we do?

713
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,119
I command soldiers, not civilians.

714
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,479
We don't want to run away.
They will use this against us.

715
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,040
Are you okay?

716
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,800
They need drivers for convoys
to Jerusalem. They asked me.

717
01:08:07,879 --> 01:08:09,680
Did you agree?

718
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:12,640
Yes, I will be gone for many weeks.

719
01:08:15,879 --> 01:08:17,520
We need to talk.

720
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:18,640
Right.

721
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:25,040
It's difficult for me, and people are talking.

722
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,720
- I don't give a damn.
- And I don't.

723
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,239
Evacuate women and children, will you leave?

724
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,920
- What's the difference?
- I won't leave you here alone.

725
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Alone? What do you mean?
The kibbutz is full of people.

726
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:44,119
I was talking about myself. What should I do? I love you.

727
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:48,920
I can't stand this separation.
It hurts, I don't understand it.

728
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,920
Elyakim, please.

729
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,600
I am also suffering.

730
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,479
Sorry.

731
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:07,119
Do you have something against pajamas?

732
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:12,320
You will consume all the hot water.
Now it's our turn.

733
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:15,119
That's not fair.

734
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:31,040
Get out, you've been sitting there for half an hour.

735
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:33,760
It takes so much to wash away the sand,
With which you sprinkled me.

736
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,680
Jamus is big, he needs time.

737
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,160
Bastards!

738
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:40,840
What do you do?

739
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,520
What's that? Someone is shooting?

740
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,600
Let's go!

741
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:03,680
Ada, it's funny.You haven't laughed in a long time.

742
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,760
It was worth it. You're finally smiling.

743
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,800
Idiot.

744
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:35,920
In a moment Ben Gurion
will declare Israel's independence.

745
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,239
We are not as educated as you,
Just primitive, like the Arabs.

746
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,200
People who are afraid to fight,
do not deserve independence.

747
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:48,400
I am not afraid, I am against the war.
What about the agreement?

748
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:54,239
With the Arabs? Ask Zigi how they
they got along in the concentration camp.

749
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:57,360
Did they hold political debates there?

750
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:00,200
- Have you ever talked to an Arab?
- I wish I had.

751
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,160
- Ada, took seats for us.
- For you and Mira.

752
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:08,000
He always takes a seat for her.

753
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,000
Now he has taken two on purpose.
He wants to separate us.

754
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:15,119
Stop, we are supposed to play.

755
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:19,479
You spend all day with him
At work, in the evening you have to too?

756
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,520
- I say silly things, enough of that.
- Ada...

757
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,360
Hasn't it started yet?

758
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:42,600
- Elyakim left?
- Yes.

759
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,479
Then who did you dress up for?

760
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,400
Take care of your love affairs, not mine.

761
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,239
Romance? Since when have you been romantic?

762
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,520
It all depends on the situation.

763
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,040
Quiet. This is important.

764
01:12:10,439 --> 01:12:13,879
My only souvenir from home.

765
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,360
Family.

766
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,720
I wish they were here today.

767
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,439
And they listened to it.

768
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:34,040
We are listening to a speech by
Ben Gurion, the leader of Israel.

769
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:37,360
A country that is not recognized by
any of its neighbors.

770
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:41,119
He claims that Israel is being created

771
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,280
On the principles of historical justice.

772
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:49,680
But where is this justice
For the Palestinians?

773
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:53,520
What are you filming? Our humiliation?

774
01:12:53,879 --> 01:12:56,520
To let everyone see our downfall?

775
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,840
Get out.

776
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:01,760
I don't want to humiliate anyone.

777
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:06,000
It hurts me, too. I tell the story.

778
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,640
Should I shoot you?

779
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:09,879
Return to Cairo.

780
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,800
To your beautiful life.

781
01:13:12,879 --> 01:13:16,479
To beautiful words,
Which do not require action.

782
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,119
- I'm not hurting anyone.
- It's over.

783
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,479
I respect you.

784
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:25,600
But my job is to document
what's going on. Shoot.

785
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,920
Turn off the camera!

786
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,520
Abraham?

787
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:50,840
They are having a good time.
I knew you were here.

788
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,959
- I brought you something to eat.
- Thank you.

789
01:13:55,400 --> 01:13:56,680
Are you worried?

790
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,080
Wondering.

791
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,400
What?

792
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:05,360
I wrote about you to my mother.

793
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:07,000
What?

794
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,879
That there is someone... That's all.

795
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,800
Do you always tell her everything?

796
01:14:13,879 --> 01:14:17,479
She also me. She used to have a lover.

797
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,640
She used to take us to the beach,
to listen to music.

798
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,959
We ate ice cream, it was nice.

799
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:27,560
Didn't you mind,
That she was with her lover?

800
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:32,640
I love it. I know,
That she is doing what makes her happy.

801
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,080
I can't believe you were okay with that.

802
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,680
Hurry up. I don't want,
them to see us together.

803
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:12,760
I wonder if he is with her.
Poor Elyakim.

804
01:15:13,239 --> 01:15:18,040
- He is an adult. He knows what he's doing.
- They have a child.

805
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:21,800
They should be careful. So should we.

806
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:26,560
I would like to have a child. Seriously.

807
01:15:27,879 --> 01:15:30,160
- Mom said...
- Look.

808
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:46,720
Egyptians dropped bombs
on the Tel Aviv bus station.

809
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:54,000
42 killed, more than a hundred injured,
many in critical condition.

810
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:14,119
Yad Mordechai.

811
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:18,560
They bomb them. They destroy everything.

812
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:23,320
Your turn.

813
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,640
Mr. Hassanin!

814
01:16:28,879 --> 01:16:31,479
What's going on? Say.

815
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:36,760
The lieutenant asked that you
come quickly. With Youssef.

816
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,400
Will we be filming?

817
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:45,040
- What?
- I ask, what are we going to film?

818
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:55,239
What happened?

819
01:16:56,479 --> 01:16:57,959
God is great.

820
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,520
I can see by your smile,
That you finally got rid of me.

821
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,080
Am I right?

822
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,560
Where are you sending us?

823
01:17:09,640 --> 01:17:11,600
You are not going anywhere.

824
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,760
Where's the videographer?

825
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:18,040
It will come soon.

826
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,320
- You are being terribly dramatic.
- After all, you were looking for drama.

827
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,360
Everyone loves him.

828
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,959
You can film.

829
01:17:32,040 --> 01:17:33,200
What?

830
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:35,119
Me.

831
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,000
Film.

832
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,280
Already?

833
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:53,760
Yad Mordechai is no more.

834
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:56,879
The Jews fled like rats.

835
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:59,360
Many were killed.

836
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,439
Do you know what this means?

837
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:08,160
With God's help
This is the beginning of the end of their colony.

838
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:15,200
Everyone is worried and waiting for help.

839
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:18,680
I understand, but at the moment
there is nothing we can do.

840
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,640
I organized the evacuation of women,
children and the sick.

841
01:18:22,720 --> 01:18:25,400
Help will come during the attack.

842
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,280
We expected it
and we will do the right thing.

843
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,680
From now on, we talk in code.

844
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:39,400
Their army has great intelligence,
we have to be careful. Come up with something.

845
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,280
Cipher.

846
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,160
Do you know any code?

847
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:51,000
Cipher? Yes.

848
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,000
Which one?

849
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:55,840
- Pig Latin.
- What.

850
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,360
Haven't you played with it?

851
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,520
Dad misses you very much,
you too, right?

852
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:08,879
Yes.

853
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:13,640
You will go to him soon.
He is preparing many surprises for you.

854
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,320
- Let's talk.
- Have you packed your bags?

855
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,400
Not much of that.

856
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:29,000
You have to mix it well, because they won't fall asleep.

857
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,040
They will start crying and we can't cope.

858
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:36,600
They need to be broken up.

859
01:19:37,239 --> 01:19:40,800
How? You break everything down.

860
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:47,280
Stop it, enough of the facades.
The situation is unbearable.

861
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:51,920
Exactly. Enough of these surprises.

862
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,400
We are not soldiers, you come with me.

863
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,800
You said we would always be together.

864
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,600
This is our only weapon.

865
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:08,680
You are my only family.

866
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:13,119
A promise is a promise.

867
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:15,800
It must be kept.

868
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:22,640
Sleep, baby.

869
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:28,080
Yerach take you on a trip.
Dad is waiting with surprises.

870
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,680
- With chocolate.
- Yes.

871
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,720
Remember me.

872
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,160
Hold it tight.

873
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:44,200
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes.

874
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:46,680
- I just...
- I know what I'm doing.

875
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:49,479
Give him a letter. If something happens to me...

876
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,200
How can you say that? Do you think you...

877
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,520
I don't think anything.

878
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:00,360
Give Elyakim a hug from me.

879
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,320
Enough, please.

880
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,520
See you in the morning.

881
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:09,959
Are you okay?

882
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,760
You're doing the right thing, we can't help you here.

883
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,680
Moving on.

884
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:02,959
Forgive me.

885
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:05,479
Hadasa!

886
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,000
Sleep, Dani. Sleep, little one.

887
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,040
Everything will be fine.

888
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,560
What's up?

889
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,879
Sorry, I got scared.

890
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:43,479
Calm. What are you doing here?

891
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,640
I can't get to sleep.

892
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:53,360
I came to buy sleeping pills for children.

893
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:57,920
I figured they would help me.

894
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:06,600
On the ground!

895
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:10,760
- What are those explosions?
- They can be heard from the side of the bridge.

896
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:17,320
We need to deliver the children quickly
and return to Nitzanim before dawn.

897
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,160
Help?

898
01:24:20,720 --> 01:24:22,560
Come to me.

899
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,920
Sleep, baby.

900
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,080
Thank you.

901
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,840
- I just want to say that...
- I know.

902
01:24:47,479 --> 01:24:51,000
If something happens to Hadas,
it will be because of you.

903
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:56,479
You will have her blood on your hands.

904
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,760
Do you understand?

905
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:08,959
Iron Gate, Sparrow here. Sound off.

906
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:20,000
Iron Gate here, say.

907
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,119
Did the package reach you safely?

908
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:28,879
I want to know if the package has arrived.

909
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:32,080
Sparrow,

910
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,360
The package has not arrived yet.

911
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,200
I will send someone to the gate,

912
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,400
To wait for the package.

913
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,000
What did she say?

914
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:55,040
They haven't arrived yet.

915
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,720
It's taking too long.

916
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:03,080
They should already be in place.

917
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:13,280
If something happens to them...

918
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,400
To the children, Ada...

919
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:23,439
Do you think something happened to them?
Why didn't they arrive?

920
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,760
I don't know.

921
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,119
It was a mistake.

922
01:26:29,879 --> 01:26:31,280
Why?

923
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:34,439
I knew it was dangerous here.

924
01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:39,040
I decided that when it gets hot,
I would send Dani away.

925
01:26:41,879 --> 01:26:44,040
I am a bad person.

926
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,360
I didn't see it coming.

927
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:49,280
Me too.

928
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,280
I am not brave.

929
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:55,760
Ada is not as strong either,
as she appears to be.

930
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,200
Our moms are sisters.

931
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:02,320
Her father lost all his property

932
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,680
and walked away.

933
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,600
Then her mother started drinking.

934
01:27:11,879 --> 01:27:13,400
Until she died.

935
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:18,840
Ada has only me.

936
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:25,720
She wouldn't have come here if it weren't for me.

937
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,720
It doesn't fit in this place.

938
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,479
Sparrow, Iron Gate here.

939
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:42,479
Iron Gate, here Sparrow.

940
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:50,760
The shipment arrived on time.

941
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,959
The birds will soon fly home.

942
01:27:58,959 --> 01:28:01,439
Thank you. I am checking out.

943
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,119
Mira, come on!

944
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,360
What's going on?

945
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:27,959
Tanks, trucks, guns, armored vehicles.

946
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:30,640
They don't shoot at us.

947
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:36,800
Identify the tanks. How many are there?
What kind of armaments are they? What kind of guns?

948
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,280
I don't know, you can't see.

949
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:44,959
Unknown. Forgiveness.
That's a lot of tanks.

950
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:56,160
Our military
would easily destroy Nitzanim,

951
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,439
But the commander was not
interested in the villages.

952
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:04,160
He wanted to reach
Tel Aviv.

953
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:09,080
The commander of the artillery battery Brigadier
Naguib sat with us in the village.

954
01:30:09,959 --> 01:30:14,800
He was to oversee logistics
and guard all equipment.

955
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,840
Me and Youssef joined the army,

956
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:26,800
To film the victory,
which the general promised the king.

957
01:30:26,879 --> 01:30:29,760
But victory was not forthcoming.

958
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,640
The attack failed because the general
did not send scouts.

959
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:39,479
And he didn't know that the Jews had blown up the
the bridge leading to Tel Aviv.

960
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,600
Many were killed, some were taken
Jewish captivity.

961
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,600
It was a nightmare.

962
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:55,520
This was not the kind of film the king expected.

963
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:34,080
We can get started.

964
01:31:34,879 --> 01:31:39,160
It was clear that we would not win this war.

965
01:31:39,879 --> 01:31:43,040
And that our army must return home.

966
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:49,000
And at home, when the soldiers start
talk, it will be the end for the king.

967
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:08,800
Do you hear?

968
01:32:08,879 --> 01:32:11,920
Is it already? It has arrived.

969
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:15,720
On time.

970
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,160
Quick! Are you all set?

971
01:32:32,360 --> 01:32:34,479
Whose turn is it? Kilometer?

972
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,479
No. I did it last time.
I think it's Jamus' turn.

973
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:42,640
Rabbit racing?

974
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:44,640
- Habani, go.
- Me?

975
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,959
Right.

976
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,640
I'll go.

977
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:01,400
- No way.
- It's not your turn.

978
01:33:01,479 --> 01:33:02,400
But I want to.

979
01:33:03,200 --> 01:33:04,560
Do you want to die?

980
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,959
Why?

981
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:08,720
I miss the piano.

982
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,439
10,

983
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:17,760
9,

984
01:33:18,119 --> 01:33:19,360
8,

985
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,920
7,

986
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:22,280
6...

987
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:28,479
Frightening.

988
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:34,640
Fire!

989
01:33:36,879 --> 01:33:37,760
Get down!

990
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:51,520
Zigi, quickly!

991
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,680
Get moving!

992
01:33:58,959 --> 01:34:00,680
Faster!

993
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,280
Get moving!

994
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:41,160
Very sorry, can't we hit
the building and get it over with?

995
01:34:41,239 --> 01:34:45,439
It would have come out disorderly and without dignity.
The war is over.

996
01:35:02,239 --> 01:35:04,640
Darn it! Beef stew again.

997
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:08,200
- Naomi, will you paste something in to kill the flavor?
- Please.

998
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:11,239
- What?
- You should add - please.

999
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,479
Not a bad time for a lesson in manners.

1000
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,760
Okay, here you go.

1001
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,560
Ziggi?

1002
01:36:48,959 --> 01:36:51,239
You can play something more...

1003
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,080
joyful?

1004
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,479
And what will you forgive me for?

1005
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:16,280
Sorry about that one.

1006
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:20,560
What is your real name?

1007
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,000
Haim.

1008
01:37:43,640 --> 01:37:46,959
At last, our army was coming home.

1009
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:53,320
But the king gave a clear order:
we need victory before returning.

1010
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:57,800
The general appointed Naguib as commander.

1011
01:38:04,640 --> 01:38:08,560
Once again, I found myself in...

1012
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:10,640
Nitzanim.

1013
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:27,080
Iron Gate, this is Sparrow. Can you hear me?

1014
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,840
- What's going on?
- Trying.

1015
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:39,600
Iron Gate, this is Sparrow. Can you hear me?

1016
01:38:43,239 --> 01:38:47,520
Iron Gate? The radio is
in the sand, looking for an SOS signal.

1017
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,640
- What are you doing?
- I hear something.

1018
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:40,600
- Is the radio working?
- Trying.

1019
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,520
- I can't film.
- And I live like that.

1020
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:10,080
Did they get the SOS signal?

1021
01:40:10,439 --> 01:40:11,760
I don't know.

1022
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,479
I think I got the SOS signal.

1023
01:40:20,439 --> 01:40:21,879
He was distorted.

1024
01:40:21,959 --> 01:40:24,879
They sent an SOS, we need to send them support.

1025
01:40:24,959 --> 01:40:27,760
Wait. Are you sure you heard the SOS?

1026
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:29,520
I think it is.

1027
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,479
Yes or no? This is important. Keep trying.

1028
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,640
We promised them support. They are counting on us.

1029
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:42,600
This is war. You don't do what,
what the enemy expects.

1030
01:40:42,680 --> 01:40:47,840
Even if it means sacrificing someone.
Besides, it's too early to talk

1031
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,119
About the sacrifice, because we don't know the situation.
Try to contact them.

1032
01:40:54,080 --> 01:40:57,879
We are 500 meters from the main gate.

1033
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:01,920
We go to the back entrance.

1034
01:41:07,400 --> 01:41:09,520
Where is our support?

1035
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,360
Will it be here soon?

1036
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,600
Take out the cannon, Abraham will move it.

1037
01:41:21,239 --> 01:41:22,840
- Now?
- Yes.

1038
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,479
Remember the plan? We point the gun inward.

1039
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:32,280
You shoot only when necessary.

1040
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,720
Not yet.

1041
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:45,280
Aim at the turret,
so they can see where we're shooting from.

1042
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:47,160
Fire!

1043
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:04,720
300 meters from the rear entrance.

1044
01:42:15,160 --> 01:42:17,640
We are at the main gate.

1045
01:42:28,680 --> 01:42:30,640
We need to neutralize the bazooka.

1046
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:32,280
Forward!

1047
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:57,800
Reverse the cannon!

1048
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:04,560
Habani!

1049
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:10,520
Done.

1050
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:17,000
None of this. We're retreating, fast!

1051
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,439
Back off!

1052
01:43:32,119 --> 01:43:33,239
Habani...

1053
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,520
Habani, what about you?

1054
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:40,239
Zigi?

1055
01:43:48,959 --> 01:43:52,119
Don't be afraid. Take it easy.

1056
01:43:57,720 --> 01:43:59,040
Enter carefully.

1057
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:01,080
Mira, come on.

1058
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:05,239
Habani, let's go.

1059
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:15,040
Check if there are wounded in the trenches.

1060
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,400
Line up in three columns.

1061
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:47,000
Yerach, we need to get out of here.

1062
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,280
Naomi, it's me Haim.

1063
01:45:09,119 --> 01:45:11,400
Hush, it's me.

1064
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,800
Quiet.

1065
01:45:47,959 --> 01:45:51,160
- Did you film it?
- Yes, I need a new tape.

1066
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,720
Ben Gigi...

1067
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:14,640
Salman, look to the right.

1068
01:46:33,119 --> 01:46:35,280
Salman, don't give up.

1069
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:38,320
Stay with me. Look at me.

1070
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:46,360
When they start shooting, run away.

1071
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:22,000
Where are the rest?

1072
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,000
We will try to escape through the beach.

1073
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:29,720
Egyptians are not barbarians,
They will take care of our wounded.

1074
01:47:29,800 --> 01:47:31,400
But the rest must run.

1075
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:36,640
Get ready!

1076
01:47:37,160 --> 01:47:41,760
Shoot only if attacked.
I want captives.

1077
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,640
In position!

1078
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,119
Romek!

1079
01:47:55,439 --> 01:47:56,959
Catch Me.

1080
01:47:59,160 --> 01:48:00,560
God!

1081
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:02,920
Support won't come?

1082
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,119
- Come back.
- What do you mean?

1083
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:20,920
I will cover you. Come back!

1084
01:48:29,200 --> 01:48:32,280
- Hadasa!
- Leave her alone!

1085
01:48:32,360 --> 01:48:33,200
No!

1086
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,400
Hold your fire!

1087
01:49:03,680 --> 01:49:05,800
Enough said.

1088
01:49:07,640 --> 01:49:10,280
This way we will all die.

1089
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:22,920
What do you do?

1090
01:49:23,600 --> 01:49:25,439
- It doesn't make sense.
- What?

1091
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,640
What is pointless?

1092
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:33,720
Everyone must not die. I have to...

1093
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:35,840
This is irresponsible.

1094
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:38,720
- Don't.
- I have to.

1095
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,400
Clear?

1096
01:49:42,280 --> 01:49:43,520
Don't shoot!

1097
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,920
Please don't shoot.

1098
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:50,239
We give up.

1099
01:50:05,600 --> 01:50:06,800
Please!

1100
01:50:14,239 --> 01:50:15,720
Don't shoot.

1101
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:18,760
Please. I want to talk.

1102
01:50:34,479 --> 01:50:37,080
Are you filming it?

1103
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:40,439
- Yes.
- Zoom in on her.

1104
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:01,680
- Who is shooting?
- Ammunition exploded in a burning tank.

1105
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,920
No one is shooting.

1106
01:51:05,640 --> 01:51:06,560
Who did it?

1107
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:11,160
- I heard the shot and thought....
- You act without thinking.

1108
01:51:11,959 --> 01:51:15,080
We go in there, you wait.

1109
01:51:15,959 --> 01:51:21,520
Do nothing without an order.
I said, I want prisoners.

1110
01:51:52,959 --> 01:51:56,320
The king finally got what he wanted.

1111
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:01,600
A perfect picture of victory.

1112
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:06,400
Our ruler, His Majesty King Faruk,

1113
01:52:06,479 --> 01:52:09,840
He personally led
our victorious army.

1114
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:17,320
Our army destroyed the Zionist
Fort and killed thousands of enemy soldiers.

1115
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:29,040
Our brave warriors defeated the enemy
Under the watchful eye of the beloved king.

1116
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:32,320
What a lie!

1117
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:37,320
They shot shots of the king in Cairo
Cairo and incorporated those fragments into the film.

1118
01:52:43,959 --> 01:52:47,400
After a year, the captives were exchanged.

1119
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:52,920
We treated the returning soldiers
as traitors.

1120
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:58,879
The Israelites treated their
with equal contempt and also recognized their

1121
01:52:58,959 --> 01:53:00,680
For traitors.

1122
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:08,479
This behavior was driving me
me into a rage.

1123
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:14,600
Anyone who did not fight in this war,
had no right to judge these young people,

1124
01:53:14,680 --> 01:53:17,400
Who were returning broken by the war.

1125
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:22,320
Years later, I asked
a historian friend,

1126
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:27,280
to find information about Nitzani.

1127
01:54:28,119 --> 01:54:33,840
In the book I got from him,
I found her picture.

1128
01:54:35,080 --> 01:54:37,640
One sentence struck me.

1129
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:42,520
"No separation is as difficult,
As the separation of mother and child."

1130
01:54:42,600 --> 01:54:46,800
She wrote this knowing that she would no longer
she would not see her son.

1131
01:54:46,879 --> 01:54:48,600
And that smile...

1132
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:50,680
As if to say:

1133
01:54:51,200 --> 01:54:57,080
Let's make a deal, take me
and grant me eternal life.

1134
01:54:57,720 --> 01:55:01,400
Eternal glory. In history and in legend.

1135
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:06,119
She made a deal with death.

1136
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:14,800
And would I be able to give my life

1137
01:55:14,879 --> 01:55:18,879
And lose those I love,
For such a deal?

1138
01:55:18,959 --> 01:55:21,119
For glory?

1139
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,560
We look forward to seeing you.

1140
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:36,479
I'm not rushing you.

1141
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:39,720
We miss you.

1142
01:55:41,840 --> 01:55:43,600
But we are patient.

1143
01:55:45,800 --> 01:55:48,439
It doesn't have to happen today.

1144
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,119
Haste is a satanic invention.

1145
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:55,959
Love?

1146
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,200
Do you know why I'm so lucky?

1147
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:07,959
Why?

1148
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:11,439
- Because you are smarter than me.
- I know.

1149
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,239
Let's go.

1150
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:17,200
- Artichokes?
- Yes.

1151
01:56:17,720 --> 01:56:22,040
When you were sitting here,
the children didn't want to disturb you.

1152
01:56:22,119 --> 01:56:25,920
But they missed you very much.

1153
01:56:27,239 --> 01:56:29,600
I follow them, too.

1154
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:35,720
At the table, let's not talk politics.

1155
01:56:36,239 --> 01:56:39,520
Life is a completely different matter.

1156
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:20,600
IN MEMORY OF MIRY BEN ARI

1157
02:00:22,600 --> 02:00:25,560
MEMORY OF YERACHMIEL YERACH BLEIBERG

1158
02:00:26,879 --> 02:00:30,280
MEMORY OF ALL YOUNG
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES,

1159
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:33,200
WHO LOST THEIR LIVES
IN THE FIGHT FOR NITZANIM
