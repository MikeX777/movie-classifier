1
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,001
The Emperor arrived
with imperiaI relief

2
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:44,404
As this has been
an imperial hunt

3
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:47,361
capped by a super finale

4
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:51,445
You have a great talent
for the chase

5
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:54,043
Your efforts deserve
a reward

6
00:02:54,487 --> 00:02:56,637
Do you wish to become
my Master of hounds?

7
00:02:57,767 --> 00:03:02,079
Or would you like
an embassy?

8
00:03:03,607 --> 00:03:05,563
I feeI privileged to be
so honored

9
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:09,801
I refuse to stay here

10
00:03:13,087 --> 00:03:16,476
It's some kind of plot

11
00:03:16,927 --> 00:03:21,602
Why couldn't my husband
simply say...

12
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:24,362
he would prefer to be
ambassador in London?

13
00:03:47,887 --> 00:03:50,799
Does the Emperor think...

14
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,758
you cannot be both
ambassador and master?

15
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:04,637
But you can! You can be
one and the other

16
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:08,516
You will never leave, Madam

17
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:11,407
Heinberg, it is your turn to choose

18
00:04:11,727 --> 00:04:14,002
Would you rather have the
woods in which we hunted...

19
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:17,478
in my coaI mines?

20
00:04:18,127 --> 00:04:20,163
I believe you also know
about mining?

21
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,876
I do, but I'd rather have
the woodland

22
00:04:23,207 --> 00:04:26,085
No more than you wished to
become an ambassador

23
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:29,717
Choice, Your Highness, is
a great privilege

24
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:52,043
and guard its secrets

25
00:04:52,487 --> 00:04:57,083
"I am part of the part
that once used to be,

26
00:04:57,527 --> 00:05:00,121
I can explain things to the Emperor
I'm sure I can persuade him

27
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:04,638
I shall have to dismiss my adjutant

28
00:05:09,087 --> 00:05:11,920
No doesn't know
I'm here either

29
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:15,559
No one does

30
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:20,679
I don't understand

31
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:25,598
Your Majesty displayed
such acumen today...

32
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:32,644
in granting people's
hidden wishes...

33
00:05:33,087 --> 00:05:35,396
that I am sure
you can see to it...

34
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:38,724
If events are allowed
to take their couree...

35
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:51,996
Well?

36
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:55,081
You wanted me to
alter my decision?

37
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:59,520
Yes.

38
00:06:02,047 --> 00:06:06,484
You thought I'd give way
to a woman?

39
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:22,660
At last I've got what I wanted.

40
00:06:37,727 --> 00:06:41,356
What did you promise me?
What price your word?

41
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:47,399
Got anything in writing,
Your Highness?

42
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,478
Frightening the game away!

43
00:06:51,927 --> 00:06:53,565
You'll a man of my word

44
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,805
It would cost you too much

45
00:06:57,647 --> 00:07:00,878
You're in financiaI trouble.
New palaces are expensive

46
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:05,565
Name your price!

47
00:07:06,487 --> 00:07:09,081
You seem to be an expert
on coaI

48
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:13,315
No worse than on timber

49
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:18,921
Whoever went into caI here
acquired...

50
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:23,558
I mean to that too...

51
00:07:40,847 --> 00:07:42,325
How much,
Herr "von"

52
00:07:43,807 --> 00:07:47,163
I don't want anything

53
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:49,116
My father and grandfather
served you as wuntsman

54
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:55,077
I do not intend to-
at any price

55
00:07:55,527 --> 00:07:56,960
One question

56
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:02,240
Who did better out
of that imperiaI hunt?

57
00:08:21,407 --> 00:08:24,717
Listen to me, Highness

58
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:23,076
Did I, by ceasing to be
your huntsman...

59
00:09:24,047 --> 00:09:27,676
Are you any closer...

60
00:09:28,287 --> 00:09:33,486
THE MAGNATE

61
00:09:33,927 --> 00:09:35,883
Gentlemen!

62
00:09:38,607 --> 00:09:42,122
I have received sad news

63
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:46,759
Our employer...

64
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,323
Why is it so quiet?

65
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:56,203
Why is it so quiet?

66
00:09:56,647 --> 00:09:57,921
When a soldier lies dying
there should be noise!

67
00:09:58,367 --> 00:10:01,006
The sirens should be
sounding!

68
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:05,406
What's going on?

69
00:10:05,847 --> 00:10:07,903
Sirens?

70
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,956
Does that mean I've died?

71
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,285
What did that alarm mean?

72
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,235
Are you afraid to tell us...
there's no work for us?

73
00:10:22,687 --> 00:10:25,247
I'm the one who
switched on the sirens

74
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:29,362
The Prince is dying

75
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:33,600
Hans, tell me...
that it's not my fault,

76
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:40,725
that it's not my doing

77
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:44,716
Her Highness would like to know...
if her husband is any better

78
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,955
I can't speak for
my Polish colleague...

79
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,886
Sirens...

80
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:55,075
Sirens...
I know... It was Nelke

81
00:10:55,567 --> 00:10:57,444
Maybe my sons will hear?

82
00:10:57,887 --> 00:11:00,878
Hear the sirens!

83
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,285
Can your
crystaI ball tell your Director Zbierski

84
00:11:04,727 --> 00:11:06,365
I wonder what will
come of this

85
00:11:06,807 --> 00:11:11,597
Look!

86
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,641
Bolko!

87
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:54,959
Here's Bolko

88
00:14:30,047 --> 00:14:32,356
Last month's business...

89
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:38,521
and a draft of
the French contract

90
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:42,844
You work so hard for me,
von Teuss

91
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:48,560
I'll raise your salary
and make you...

92
00:14:48,887 --> 00:14:54,324
It will crown the history
of our families

93
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,197
I'm afraid I must refuse

94
00:15:07,727 --> 00:15:10,082
Family duties are
calling me...

95
00:15:10,407 --> 00:15:14,195
and the go back to
the 12th century

96
00:15:14,927 --> 00:15:19,125
I find it hard to know
what to make of you Prince.

97
00:15:19,847 --> 00:15:23,635
I can't return
the compliment

98
00:15:25,607 --> 00:15:29,315
A telegram, Count. Urgent

99
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:31,478
What are you gawking at?

100
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:47,480
I haven't seen him
for ten years

101
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,004
He disowned me
for becoming a Catholic

102
00:16:17,687 --> 00:16:19,996
He played God with
our lives

103
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:24,759
For five days I was kept
locked up in a room

104
00:16:25,687 --> 00:16:28,838
To this day I still can't
get out of that room

105
00:16:37,847 --> 00:16:41,283
We shall see

106
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,603
Welcome. Prince

107
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:27,637
Hello.

108
00:17:37,727 --> 00:17:42,198
Our younger sister

109
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:48,918
Silly of me - I forgot

110
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,119
Can he also have come
to make his peace?

111
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:56,796
Hens still lay eggs

112
00:18:04,047 --> 00:18:09,565
The world wasn't fated to end
with my death

113
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:15,200
I see, Yurek, that you too...
have come to attend my funeraI

114
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:18,280
Please forgive me
my faux pas

115
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:46,320
I have no intention
of dying

116
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,326
As I lay there in my bed...
dying my little death...

117
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,201
it occurred to me that I ought...
to have another child

118
00:18:56,527 --> 00:19:01,920
At my age that could be
an achievement

119
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:20,364
"I will hold out for twenty more years
on the virility front"

120
00:20:21,207 --> 00:20:25,962
You don't know,
you Prussian numskulls!

121
00:20:26,887 --> 00:20:29,879
If the press gets hold
of your joko...

122
00:20:30,207 --> 00:20:34,245
Heinberg and Krupp will die laughing

123
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,805
You've a subject...

124
00:20:42,127 --> 00:20:45,196
That's right. A farce.

125
00:20:48,727 --> 00:20:52,515
I think you gentlemen
wish to be left alone

126
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:58,797
Is it you who are going
to give him this child?

127
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:03,362
Sit down Conrad!
You no longer count

128
00:21:06,567 --> 00:21:08,762
Your conversion has
made you a Pole...

129
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:23,366
I am Franz Friedrich XVIII

130
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:45,995
and is laughing at us

131
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:49,604
So you believe the family
is all-important?

132
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:53,438
Absolutely

133
00:21:54,927 --> 00:21:58,043
it is strong. It grows
effetes if it yields...

134
00:21:58,527 --> 00:22:01,519
to individualist urges

135
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:06,438
I daresay. Now and then

136
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:12,884
You want proof?
You marriage to Marisca

137
00:22:13,367 --> 00:22:16,200
You chose a woman
reeking of scandaI

138
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:20,162
And Conrad's parties?

139
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,484
Nude chorus boys cavorting
on the lawn...

140
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:29,726
Or Bolko's notorious plunges
at all of Europe's gaming tables?

141
00:22:34,847 --> 00:22:38,396
It's my free will

142
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:43,278
Free will belongs
to mythology

143
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:25,962
In reaI lift what counts
is strength of will

144
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,847
- Am I? I didn't know
- Look it up!

145
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,959
Are you talking about
family or fortune?

146
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:01,880
Property and family

147
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:07,441
Properly managed,
our property...

148
00:24:10,487 --> 00:24:12,921
...could make us one of
Europe's foremost families

149
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:19,085
But we already are

150
00:24:20,007 --> 00:24:22,999
As far as debts go,
no question

151
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:25,557
Maybe you'd like to try?

152
00:24:39,407 --> 00:24:44,481
How broad?

153
00:25:37,567 --> 00:25:41,640
Very broad

154
00:26:01,687 --> 00:26:03,517
In that case I'll be
begging for my bread

155
00:26:29,247 --> 00:26:32,319
It's for the good of
the family and so yours too

156
00:26:47,367 --> 00:26:49,403
And yours

157
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,878
You'll get
your power af attorney

158
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:02,762
Such youthfuI enthusiasm
does the heart good

159
00:27:05,527 --> 00:27:08,724
But consider one thing

160
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:11,436
Instead of regent...

161
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:20,602
You were so wrong...

162
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,839
believing that absurd
pack of lies

163
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:25,839
Then why does the Emperor
make so much of you?

164
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:18,037
All those courtesies,
pretty speeches?

165
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,361
that clutching of
little hands?

166
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:27,224
Not the way you do,
you Prussian numskulls

167
00:28:30,207 --> 00:28:36,077
Because you were his lover

168
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,283
I was not

169
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:47,006
Know why he treats me
differently from you?

170
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:52,520
Not because I'm a woman...

171
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:57,444
instead of just agreeing
like you sycophants

172
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:04,716
You can't see beneath
the surface of things

173
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:13,883
That's why you were denied
a diplomatic career...

174
00:29:15,007 --> 00:29:20,798
not because I was
the Emperor's mistress

175
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,721
- So you ware!
- I wasn't

176
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:28,677
- You just said so!
- No

177
00:29:32,847 --> 00:29:35,281
I said something else

178
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,963
You admitted it!

179
00:29:39,287 --> 00:29:40,686
I did not

180
00:29:41,007 --> 00:29:43,521
Yes! I was!

181
00:29:43,847 --> 00:29:46,645
If it helps you
justify our failures...

182
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,844
I was the Emperor's
mistress

183
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:54,082
Noooo!

184
00:29:55,807 --> 00:29:58,401
At last you're not
certain of something

185
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:01,161
When the war is over...
I will find myself a new wife

186
00:30:01,487 --> 00:30:04,524
A bad woman.
with the touch of eviI

187
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:06,883
Come on!

188
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:11,246
Where's the fire?

189
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:13,956
One of ours, at a standstill
We'll move on

190
00:30:14,287 --> 00:30:18,280
There's no work for you!

191
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:24,327
"Piast", also ours
Working every other day

192
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:25,920
It was meant to be working

193
00:30:26,247 --> 00:30:30,718
The men reported for work
They're being turned away

194
00:30:31,047 --> 00:30:34,039
There's no market
for our coaI

195
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:37,438
How I love good old Silesia!

196
00:30:37,767 --> 00:30:39,200
All of this is yours

197
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:42,925
A cementworks in Ligota

198
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:47,601
Briquette factories,
brickyads and breweries in Tychy

199
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:50,804
It is and it isn't

200
00:30:51,927 --> 00:30:54,804
So they don't want
to buy our coaI?

201
00:30:55,127 --> 00:30:57,357
I see you've locket up
the siren

202
00:30:59,447 --> 00:31:03,918
Two days ago! A week ago!

203
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:07,880
Two weeks ago! A month ago!

204
00:31:08,207 --> 00:31:12,837
Look.

205
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,601
Gangsters, no doubt. From Chicago
Planning to hijack us to Singapore.

206
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,844
Step on it!
They don't have wings

207
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:26,246
Nothing, nothing...
Have they gone?

208
00:31:27,247 --> 00:31:30,637
Oh no!

209
00:31:30,967 --> 00:31:33,481
Someone's telling me
to make up my mind

210
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:36,879
Trying to force me
to join them

211
00:31:37,207 --> 00:31:39,880
- Bolko!
- Leave it.

212
00:31:40,207 --> 00:31:43,916
Get in

213
00:31:44,247 --> 00:31:47,523
Get in!

214
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:52,918
I don't want to know.
I'm leaving

215
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,523
This isn't my thing

216
00:31:57,407 --> 00:32:01,923
Apparently not

217
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:04,716
I'll represent the family
above ground

218
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:10,479
Your first descent?

219
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:13,480
All the best...

220
00:32:15,287 --> 00:32:18,723
Cheers, foreman

221
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:21,677
Cheers!

222
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:24,123
Which leveI are you
Foreman Grela

223
00:32:24,847 --> 00:32:28,806
Output - 30 tones
It's a low drift

224
00:32:30,287 --> 00:32:33,296
Why are you so small?

225
00:32:36,727 --> 00:32:41,039
You'll get machinery
when sales recover, Grela

226
00:32:42,807 --> 00:32:45,241
The market's tight now...

227
00:32:45,567 --> 00:32:49,003
Cheers!

228
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:51,795
You've laid off 400 miners

229
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:54,322
Get the herrings?

230
00:32:56,047 --> 00:32:58,356
Not now, Grela

231
00:33:37,287 --> 00:33:40,006
Come and see me
and we'll talk it over

232
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:43,444
It's you who've come to see us
Thank you kindly!

233
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:47,680
What on earth?

234
00:33:48,007 --> 00:33:51,716
What did you say?

235
00:33:52,047 --> 00:33:55,437
- Is this a breakdown or..
- Or what?

236
00:33:56,367 --> 00:34:01,566
You're learning fast

237
00:34:01,887 --> 00:34:06,244
Got any matches?

238
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:10,835
You have a candle?

239
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,395
As an offering to
Saint Barbara

240
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:15,286
So light it

241
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:19,804
If there's gas here
we'll be blown sky high

242
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:23,483
Assuming it's coincidence

243
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:29,279
if there's gas here
you'd better start praying

244
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:33,485
You'll be ging to feeI faint,
to throw up...

245
00:34:34,487 --> 00:34:37,559
Stop it!

246
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:41,597
It's all thanks to
your gracions gestures!

247
00:34:41,927 --> 00:34:44,361
It's part of the job

248
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:47,598
I should have stayed home

249
00:34:47,927 --> 00:34:50,964
Then I would have had to
suspect you as well

250
00:34:51,286 --> 00:34:53,676
Of what?

251
00:34:54,007 --> 00:34:56,521
You mean to say you don't
suspect anybody?

252
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,407
Nobody

253
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:04,919
We're in luck. It stopped
at a gallery

254
00:35:05,247 --> 00:35:08,522
Mind the step

255
00:35:08,847 --> 00:35:12,123
I wouldn't count the steps

256
00:35:19,207 --> 00:35:23,120
We're fixing it
Please keep calm

257
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:28,683
We're fixing it

258
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:34,561
Please keep calm

259
00:35:37,807 --> 00:35:39,843
We're perfectly calm

260
00:35:42,287 --> 00:35:45,359
Forgive me, Prince.
Forgive me, Count

261
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:57,520
Those responsible will be
punished. It was sabotage

262
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:20,225
You're awfully suspicious, Franzel

263
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:28,079
People should be
open and sincere

264
00:36:28,407 --> 00:36:31,501
Not in business matters

265
00:37:05,607 --> 00:37:07,757
I have to know who's
stabbing me in the back

266
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:11,437
That's why I can't leave?

267
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:16,298
I believe you have
an appointment in Warsaw?

268
00:37:19,127 --> 00:37:20,765
He's afraid of us, Conrad.
Afraid!

269
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:42,163
I wish I'd studied you
more closely as a boy

270
00:37:54,687 --> 00:37:57,759
You could have,
being the oldest

271
00:37:58,087 --> 00:38:02,922
But why can't I leave?

272
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:08,279
I'll explain. Our family...

273
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:11,565
I have to be certain that
it won't be impeded...

274
00:38:17,327 --> 00:38:19,841
by you, Conrad or Marisca

275
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,998
Otherwise the whole thing
is pointless

276
00:38:26,407 --> 00:38:28,318
I came to say goodnight
to Conrad and FranzeI

277
00:38:52,927 --> 00:38:55,361
I've already said it to you

278
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,117
Very well. I'll stay here
as long as you wish

279
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:14,199
Let's see you lead the family to greatness

280
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,037
May I?

281
00:39:20,087 --> 00:39:23,921
I can't be sure...
but if what I think is correct...

282
00:39:24,247 --> 00:39:25,520
I ought to be in Germany
as soon as possible

283
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:30,877
It is of course secret
business?

284
00:39:34,687 --> 00:39:37,042
It concerns out family, father

285
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:49,643
might well resort to skullduggery
I've known that

286
00:39:58,487 --> 00:40:01,957
Well... good luck

287
00:40:02,287 --> 00:40:03,640
But if I were you
I'd remember...

288
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,525
...that one of the sources
of our greatness...

289
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:07,121
A rising?

290
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:33,444
My congratulations on
a well executed assault

291
00:40:34,567 --> 00:40:37,320
In Polish?

292
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:44,883
Might you Piast ancestors
not be telling you...

293
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:30,285
to adept Polish citizenship
when the time is right?

294
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:34,236
What are you doing, Conrad?

295
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:41,444
It's only now that I can leave
I'm free at last

296
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:44,923
Stop!

297
00:41:45,247 --> 00:41:48,603
Unpack the boys' things

298
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:57,044
You think I'd lot you
take them with you?

299
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:10,964
You don't have the right
to dictate to me

300
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:36,519
There's a rising

301
00:43:29,647 --> 00:43:32,798
Are you a Catholic, my son?

302
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:38,123
Yes, father

303
00:43:38,447 --> 00:43:40,642
Do you have any idea at all
what that means?

304
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:47,606
It means that I feel Polish

305
00:43:57,687 --> 00:44:00,679
You can feeI Dutch
for all I care

306
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:04,761
There is no more important
decision in life...

307
00:44:05,087 --> 00:44:07,078
than choice of faith You have taken it
without confiding in the family

308
00:44:07,407 --> 00:44:08,442
It was a personal decision

309
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:12,999
It cannot be
a personal decision

310
00:44:15,287 --> 00:44:17,881
Religion is a family affair

311
00:44:18,207 --> 00:44:23,201
Bring Count Conrad his trunk

312
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:29,318
He is leaving with
his mother

313
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,843
Mother's left you a letter

314
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:44,086
"My dear Hans...

315
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,997
You once said you wanted
an eviI woman to succeed me

316
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:04,317
I met her a year ago
in Cap d'Antibes

317
00:47:04,647 --> 00:47:06,842
Von Sutzpold, her husband,
committed suicide...

318
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:19,555
from, by all accounts
jealousy

319
00:47:31,127 --> 00:47:35,723
Remember, Highness
Take no nonsense from them

320
00:47:36,047 --> 00:47:41,360
He owns a beautifuI slice
of Silesia

321
00:47:50,007 --> 00:47:52,965
The Prince's position
is known to you?

322
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:57,200
But we don't know what
he expects from us

323
00:47:57,527 --> 00:47:59,643
I must show you something

324
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:06,001
I'm glad you came.

325
00:48:06,327 --> 00:48:07,999
Not a moment too soon
It was high time

326
00:48:09,327 --> 00:48:13,081
But now you must be patient.
This may take time

327
00:48:13,407 --> 00:48:16,160
That is why I have
come to you, Count

328
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:17,317
I trust you completely

329
00:48:17,647 --> 00:48:23,199
You did the right thing but...

330
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:25,722
I guessed

331
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:29,357
You're no goof

332
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:31,197
A brick was thrown
into your car...

333
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:34,644
and later you got stuck
in a mine cage?

334
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:38,039
It's incredible

335
00:48:38,367 --> 00:48:40,597
What barbarians!

336
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:43,361
Whenever you came near
I had a feeling...

337
00:48:46,647 --> 00:48:48,444
you knew everything
about me

338
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:03,160
When I realized I'd marry you
I had to, didn't I?

339
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,923
Don't think you can compare
with your father

340
00:49:09,007 --> 00:49:11,316
You don't stand a chance

341
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:17,119
If I care to I'll use your legs
as billiard cues

342
00:49:20,567 --> 00:49:21,716
If I care to!

343
00:49:47,647 --> 00:49:49,842
If I ever catch you
eavesdropping again!

344
00:49:50,167 --> 00:49:52,476
Damn! The key's gone

345
00:49:54,967 --> 00:49:57,845
It must have been FranzeI

346
00:49:59,527 --> 00:50:02,325
Look at me!

347
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:05,483
Look! I'm all poppyseed

348
00:50:06,807 --> 00:50:08,319
I'm all poppyseed

349
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:10,717
I'm all poppyseed

350
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,242
All poppyseed

351
00:50:13,567 --> 00:50:17,719
You shouldn't have come here

352
00:50:18,047 --> 00:50:20,959
- I'm all poppyseed
- You shouldn't have come!

353
00:50:23,207 --> 00:50:25,721
Go on! Go on!

354
00:50:26,047 --> 00:50:29,835
You shouldn't have!

355
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:35,037
Come on now, come here

356
00:50:36,887 --> 00:50:39,879
Well?

357
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:44,564
Don't laugh

358
00:50:44,887 --> 00:50:47,720
- I love you
- Shut up!

359
00:50:48,047 --> 00:50:52,245
Is Jolanta my daughter?

360
00:50:52,567 --> 00:50:55,445
- How can you
- I most certainly can!

361
00:50:58,927 --> 00:51:02,124
Look!

362
00:51:06,247 --> 00:51:09,478
Come here, shy!

363
00:51:09,807 --> 00:51:12,366
You will, you will!

364
00:51:12,687 --> 00:51:17,920
There's going to be...
scandaI among the nobility!

365
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:20,477
I wonder how FranzeI
will react...

366
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:22,798
to this example of...
how did he put it?

367
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:27,121
yielding to
individualist urges?

368
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:31,444
I'm pleased you've
joined us, Highness

369
00:51:59,687 --> 00:52:02,281
Look at those lads!

370
00:52:11,007 --> 00:52:13,965
Live money.

371
00:52:15,287 --> 00:52:18,801
He'll be pleased to hear
you accepted our invitation

372
00:52:47,807 --> 00:52:50,765
The peasants of Lippe...

373
00:53:00,127 --> 00:53:04,484
These journalists are a rabble
of Jews and Masons

374
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:08,640
Tonight, at the palace

375
00:53:08,967 --> 00:53:13,836
Dr Goebbels believes...

376
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:51,076
it would be ill-advised...

377
00:53:51,407 --> 00:53:53,796
He'll see you at
Schloss Vinebeck

378
00:53:57,007 --> 00:53:59,805
"ScandaI at Von Teuss Seat"
"Footman's Revelations"

379
00:54:00,127 --> 00:54:04,564
Youngest son!

380
00:54:05,727 --> 00:54:09,163
Son!

381
00:54:09,687 --> 00:54:11,678
Prince catches
youngest son!

382
00:54:12,967 --> 00:54:17,722
Catches son!

383
00:57:17,487 --> 00:57:21,196
I have talked to Hitler

384
00:57:21,527 --> 00:57:24,246
He is shocked...

385
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:29,636
...by such vilification
of an illustrious family

386
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:33,084
How could it come
to that, he asked

387
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:37,326
Is there no one capable
of taking charge?

388
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:40,241
Hitler has not yet retired

389
00:57:40,567 --> 00:57:43,035
Life twists...

390
00:57:55,607 --> 00:58:00,123
- Bolko! I can't!
- Dance!

391
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:04,005
All these strangers
I don't know anyone

392
00:58:12,887 --> 00:58:16,357
And you won't...
We won't be coming back

393
00:58:16,687 --> 00:58:19,884
Why not? Let's ask
our pet artist

394
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:22,004
Why didn't we have
a quiet wedding abroad?

395
00:58:22,327 --> 00:58:25,000
Because FranzeI suffers
from a dangerous disease

396
00:58:25,327 --> 00:58:27,795
It's called normality

397
00:58:29,927 --> 00:58:32,157
He couldn't bear the idea
of something as abnormaI...

398
00:58:32,487 --> 00:58:37,402
as a union between
stepson and stepmother...

399
00:58:37,727 --> 00:58:41,737
That's why he agreed to a wedding...

400
00:58:45,167 --> 00:58:48,442
which is the most normaI
and hallowed of customs

401
00:58:50,207 --> 00:58:52,846
You've given...

402
00:58:59,487 --> 00:59:02,843
You've given me
three splendid sons

403
00:59:03,167 --> 00:59:04,919
Very splendid...

404
00:59:07,967 --> 00:59:12,006
Och, Daisy, Daisy...

405
00:59:12,327 --> 00:59:16,445
Laugh, and the world
laughs with you

406
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:19,281
Is that an English proverb!

407
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:22,917
No, my dear

408
01:00:07,007 --> 01:00:12,127
How I wish it were!

409
01:00:13,927 --> 01:00:18,125
I lay in my cot
and went like this...

410
01:00:19,207 --> 01:00:24,156
When I became a soldier
I carried myself so...

411
01:00:26,287 --> 01:00:29,245
And when I'm a decrepit
old prince...

412
01:00:29,967 --> 01:00:34,165
I feeI like really
making you suffer

413
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:36,796
One day you will yourself
claim what's coming to you

414
01:00:37,127 --> 01:00:41,182
That's a possibility that
I've also allowed for

415
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:49,123
I wish to see the Prince

416
01:00:50,727 --> 01:00:53,799
His Highness is indisposed.

417
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:58,924
He is seeing no one

418
01:00:59,247 --> 01:01:02,283
Feeling better?

419
01:01:02,607 --> 01:01:05,883
What a beautifuI tree

420
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,559
I'll see we're buried here

421
01:01:25,287 --> 01:01:27,517
Be good to me

422
01:01:30,407 --> 01:01:32,204
From the first moment...

423
01:02:21,327 --> 01:02:24,603
that I set eyes on you...

424
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:35,326
I laid a course for you

425
01:02:35,647 --> 01:02:39,526
I'm so glad you could come

426
01:02:39,847 --> 01:02:44,602
Count
Franz Friedrich Hochberg von Teuss!

427
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:08,805
I fancy we know each other
inside out

428
01:03:09,127 --> 01:03:13,120
Me brother, Count Conrad

429
01:03:14,487 --> 01:03:17,797
I believe you've become
a Catholic?

430
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,958
So many people have stayed
away from our wedding...

431
01:04:20,527 --> 01:04:23,087
that something is due
to those who have come

432
01:04:23,407 --> 01:04:27,525
My sister-in-law

433
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,202
I understand the son
and the father too

434
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:36,045
to as Yurek
to organize this party

435
01:04:40,247 --> 01:04:42,363
I see

436
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:47,403
He's not eating
Amazing single-mindedness!

437
01:04:47,727 --> 01:04:50,844
The pineapples took off...

438
01:04:52,927 --> 01:04:55,680
and the plane had to
return to Warsaw

439
01:04:56,007 --> 01:04:57,838
Director Zbierski
would you come over here?

440
01:04:58,167 --> 01:05:00,442
Recognize him?

441
01:05:00,767 --> 01:05:02,723
That's one thing
I didn't foresee

442
01:05:04,127 --> 01:05:07,915
You have the floor

443
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:23,196
Please proceed

444
01:05:24,007 --> 01:05:25,759
I haven't come here
to complain

445
01:05:27,727 --> 01:05:31,037
Oh? Just to look at me?

446
01:05:32,287 --> 01:05:35,120
Nor do any of my three
Polish colleagues...

447
01:05:36,287 --> 01:05:39,359
whom Prince FranzeI has

448
01:05:40,727 --> 01:05:44,640
dismissed wish to complain

449
01:05:45,367 --> 01:05:50,282
Certainly not.
Why demean one self?

450
01:05:51,407 --> 01:05:54,006
There!...

451
01:05:58,727 --> 01:06:01,321
Your Highness!

452
01:06:02,807 --> 01:06:06,243
To communicate
our misgivings

453
01:06:06,567 --> 01:06:09,525
We have worked for you
for so many rears

454
01:06:09,847 --> 01:06:14,921
We know and respect you
and your family

455
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:20,274
So it pains me to have to
warn you that things...

456
01:06:28,247 --> 01:06:31,875
are in a bad way

457
01:06:32,207 --> 01:06:34,357
Very bad!

458
01:06:34,687 --> 01:06:37,804
Continue, continue

459
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:42,321
You have tax arrears
running into millions

460
01:06:47,807 --> 01:06:49,683
But what's dos
Prince FranzeI do?

461
01:06:50,007 --> 01:06:54,239
Gets involved in some kind
of hanky-panky abroad!

462
01:06:54,687 --> 01:06:57,997
Mysteriously withdraws
what's left...

463
01:06:58,327 --> 01:07:03,276
of his working capitaI!

464
01:07:09,927 --> 01:07:12,999
Director Zbierski...

465
01:07:13,327 --> 01:07:17,240
I no longer deaI
with such matters

466
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:20,957
You're in danger of
going...

467
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:26,361
The Polish government appointing trustees
to administer the property

468
01:07:26,687 --> 01:07:28,165
For how long?

469
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:48,719
Now old are you?

470
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:52,921
Sixty-eight

471
01:08:08,367 --> 01:08:11,723
I am seventy
How many more years

472
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:13,765
do I have? Five? Six?

473
01:08:17,926 --> 01:08:20,804
So I'll still be protected
by the Geneva convention

474
01:08:22,447 --> 01:08:24,243
or I can appeaI...

475
01:08:33,046 --> 01:08:37,598
The question is,
do I want to?

476
01:08:55,727 --> 01:08:58,194
Would it also surprise you...
that your funds are financing Hitler?

477
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:02,961
Lies, lies!

478
01:09:14,727 --> 01:09:16,398
Close all the doors!

479
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:51,165
Look the doors!

480
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:55,725
We'll settle up now

481
01:09:56,367 --> 01:09:59,325
Your allowance will be
remitted by Conrad...

482
01:09:59,767 --> 01:10:01,405
Aesthetically speaking,
this party can't be faulted

483
01:10:01,887 --> 01:10:03,320
with the way Bolko was
softened up for marriage

484
01:10:03,767 --> 01:10:06,201
By plain speaking or
more subteI persuasion?

485
01:10:06,647 --> 01:10:10,276
Whatever you may say,
however you try...

486
01:10:12,807 --> 01:10:14,603
I won't go away with you.
Is that clear?

487
01:10:19,407 --> 01:10:21,796
Very clear. What FranzeI's arguments
lacked in subtlety...

488
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,285
they no doubt made up
in computablity

489
01:10:26,727 --> 01:10:31,084
That's business

490
01:10:31,567 --> 01:10:33,842
And you accept that now?.

491
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,443
What a ghastly place!

492
01:10:36,927 --> 01:10:40,965
What happened?

493
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:44,121
Let them whistle!

494
01:12:09,807 --> 01:12:12,526
In Poland more steam goes
into whistles than engines

495
01:12:12,847 --> 01:12:16,237
No wonder.

496
01:12:16,567 --> 01:12:21,925
Polish miners
laid off,

497
01:12:22,247 --> 01:12:25,045
Differently?

498
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:27,676
Which is why we now owe
nine million in taxes

499
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:46,762
Listen you shit,
don't send me money

500
01:12:50,567 --> 01:12:53,206
to an account...
on which I can1t draw!

501
01:12:58,007 --> 01:13:02,558
Not now, Bolko, not now

502
01:13:12,727 --> 01:13:17,316
- I'm not stopping anything
- Good...

503
01:13:24,127 --> 01:13:25,845
Did you send Bolko
his allowance?

504
01:13:57,607 --> 01:14:00,280
Of course

505
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:42,998
Using the Ruberg account?

506
01:15:43,727 --> 01:15:45,876
That's right

507
01:15:47,087 --> 01:15:50,159
In a Polish bank?

508
01:15:50,487 --> 01:15:53,399
Then go outside and see
what you've done!

509
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,604
Come to watch a strike?

510
01:16:24,007 --> 01:16:26,964
Even more from the sight of
an owner chased by one

511
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:34,276
Rear can also be exciting

512
01:18:21,207 --> 01:18:25,246
I made it...
I can do it!

513
01:19:55,927 --> 01:19:58,759
I can do it!

514
01:20:05,487 --> 01:20:09,082
Conrad? I've gotten a hold
over FranzeI

515
01:20:10,007 --> 01:20:11,963
Made your day, have I?
You don't say?

516
01:20:17,247 --> 01:20:20,239
Conrad deflowered!
How's that for news!

517
01:20:24,207 --> 01:20:29,804
Go on, let's have it!

518
01:20:30,127 --> 01:20:32,436
The whole min's been
surrounded by the police

519
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:35,281
Director Zbierski

520
01:20:37,287 --> 01:20:40,404
They've even seized that
consignment of pineapples

521
01:20:40,727 --> 01:20:45,800
The plane's been grounded
in Warsaw

522
01:20:54,127 --> 01:20:57,244
Yes, Your Highness?

523
01:21:00,727 --> 01:21:02,558
Have the pineapples arrived?

524
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:25,523
Not yet.

525
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:28,041
The weather

526
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,116
Weather, weather
How curious!

527
01:21:35,887 --> 01:21:39,402
I'll go to the airfield
and collect them myself

528
01:21:42,287 --> 01:21:47,236
Of course. But...

529
01:21:52,007 --> 01:21:54,236
No buts! Get Joseph
to bring the car round

530
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:57,866
Of course.

531
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:17,206
But it's years since
you motored

532
01:22:17,807 --> 01:22:19,365
Stop philosophizing..

533
01:22:20,927 --> 01:22:24,920
Tell me, Casimir, how is it...
that you've stayed on with me so long?

534
01:22:27,407 --> 01:22:31,639
Isn't Poland calling you?

535
01:22:32,767 --> 01:22:37,682
I've never plumbed the depths with Poland
but with you, it's been known

536
01:22:42,607 --> 01:22:46,216
Zbierski?
What do you mean, who?

537
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:52,357
My dear friends!

538
01:22:53,487 --> 01:22:58,242
As head of that family
it is my duty...

539
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:06,120
to look after those
who are in trouble

540
01:23:56,647 --> 01:23:59,445
So please, speak out.

541
01:23:59,887 --> 01:24:02,401
We want...

542
01:24:02,847 --> 01:24:04,599
fair working hours

543
01:24:05,047 --> 01:24:06,958
We want meaI breaks
and a rest period...

544
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:12,720
at midday

545
01:24:13,167 --> 01:24:17,319
We want a full week's
work and pay

546
01:24:17,767 --> 01:24:19,644
The percentage of profits
set aside per worker...

547
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:24,126
is too low

548
01:24:24,567 --> 01:24:29,402
You go to them.

549
01:24:43,647 --> 01:24:48,117
What shall I say?

550
01:24:48,567 --> 01:24:53,083
all these new things over

551
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:56,718
Why? They're behaving
peacefully enough

552
01:25:14,407 --> 01:25:16,762
You should be more afraid of

553
01:25:28,607 --> 01:25:30,518
of directors who've never
seen a coaI face

554
01:25:30,967 --> 01:25:34,197
Who are you?

555
01:25:34,607 --> 01:25:37,679
No such engineer is employed in
His Highness's mines

556
01:25:38,127 --> 01:25:40,516
Did you hear what
the miners said?

557
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:45,442
They ware right

558
01:25:45,927 --> 01:25:48,599
All you have to do is
install steam power...

559
01:26:01,567 --> 01:26:04,479
and put up wages.

560
01:26:04,927 --> 01:26:09,397
He's right,
but he doesn't know...

561
01:26:11,167 --> 01:26:13,078
that Your Highness

562
01:26:57,567 --> 01:27:00,206
has no money

563
01:27:01,207 --> 01:27:02,481
What?

564
01:27:02,807 --> 01:27:06,959
I own all this
and I have no money?

565
01:27:07,967 --> 01:27:12,597
It's a ticklish subject
to discuss...

566
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:16,920
but vases full of flowers
don't mean

567
01:27:20,487 --> 01:27:22,955
Of course... Go and see them

568
01:27:44,407 --> 01:27:46,921
Yes.

569
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:49,876
You're are a very shrewd fellow

570
01:27:50,367 --> 01:27:54,838
We'll install your
steam engines

571
01:27:55,287 --> 01:27:58,279
But I expect you want
a job, which I don't have

572
01:27:58,727 --> 01:28:02,037
Is the pressure here
always like this?

573
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:06,156
What?

574
01:28:06,847 --> 01:28:09,964
I don't knonw...
What does it mean?

575
01:28:16,967 --> 01:28:19,527
That there's seepage

576
01:28:38,687 --> 01:28:42,316
The ground's subsiding...

577
01:28:42,647 --> 01:28:45,719
Look at the blotter

578
01:30:08,527 --> 01:30:11,325
Well I'll be damned!

579
01:30:11,647 --> 01:30:12,966
Mister Zbierski

580
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:22,078
You'd have to be mightier
than God Himself...

581
01:30:22,407 --> 01:30:26,320
Give me your hand!

582
01:30:26,647 --> 01:30:29,957
What are you doing here,
my good fairy?

583
01:30:30,287 --> 01:30:34,075
Lost your reason?

584
01:30:37,887 --> 01:30:41,357
Adventures at his age!

585
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:46,477
- I did warn you
- Piss on warnings!

586
01:30:46,807 --> 01:30:48,240
I want to know the facts.
Director Zbierski

587
01:30:48,567 --> 01:30:51,400
ex-Director

588
01:30:51,727 --> 01:30:55,639
in respect of taxes
have been...

589
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:59,402
disappearing from
a Polish bank...

590
01:30:59,727 --> 01:31:03,606
and surfacing in Munich
credited to Ruberg

591
01:31:03,927 --> 01:31:05,485
You have it in for FranzeI
for dismissing you

592
01:31:05,807 --> 01:31:09,925
Old men outlive their usefulness
They should withddraw gracefully

593
01:31:10,247 --> 01:31:12,238
Like you?

594
01:31:12,567 --> 01:31:14,637
Well, Your Highness,
it's the receiver for you

595
01:31:15,567 --> 01:31:19,003
And that won't be
the half of it

596
01:33:55,847 --> 01:33:57,758
Give me a cigar

597
01:33:58,567 --> 01:34:01,684
Go on!

598
01:34:03,007 --> 01:34:05,474
"I, Franz Friedrich XVII,
acting on behalf of...

599
01:34:07,527 --> 01:34:10,519
my father, Polish citizen
of German nationality...

600
01:34:10,847 --> 01:34:14,901
hereby lodge a complaint to the League of Nations
against the Government of Poland... "

601
01:34:14,927 --> 01:34:18,442
You read it. You wrote it

602
01:34:19,527 --> 01:34:22,724
"... of Poland which is
seeking by unlawfuI means...

603
01:34:25,287 --> 01:34:27,482
to Polonize the preorty
of Prince von Teuss..

604
01:34:30,007 --> 01:34:32,839
in order to recover
taxes wrongly assessed...

605
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:36,398
for the years 1925-29.

606
01:34:36,727 --> 01:34:39,036
This discriminatory action
which is a reprisaI...

607
01:34:43,287 --> 01:34:47,678
On behalf of my father
I demand...

608
01:34:48,007 --> 01:34:50,884
discontinuance of
all distraints...

609
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:53,118
placed on the property
of the Prince...

610
01:34:53,847 --> 01:34:56,599
as well as declaration
of the Government...

611
01:34:56,927 --> 01:35:01,284
to be in violation of
Articles 67,68,75 of the Convention"

612
01:35:14,927 --> 01:35:18,237
Why should I sign this?

613
01:35:21,407 --> 01:35:25,480
If and when I withdraw
your powers of attorney...

614
01:35:28,447 --> 01:35:31,644
then I'll start signing

615
01:35:34,087 --> 01:35:35,918
How long will I go on
signing on your behalf?

616
01:36:15,247 --> 01:36:18,125
I never ask you questions

617
01:36:18,447 --> 01:36:23,805
But if it proves to be true

618
01:36:24,127 --> 01:36:26,163
that one mark of mine...

619
01:36:26,487 --> 01:36:28,842
has paved Hitler's way
to power...

620
01:36:29,167 --> 01:36:32,682
I look forward to
seeing Granddaddy

621
01:36:33,007 --> 01:36:35,201
Daddy!

622
01:37:20,727 --> 01:37:22,638
He won't let you in

623
01:37:24,927 --> 01:37:27,487
Then I'll sneak in

624
01:37:30,407 --> 01:37:32,796
Germany.

625
01:37:36,127 --> 01:37:38,357
Then Casimir will
drive us into Poland

626
01:37:42,207 --> 01:37:44,118
- It's very near
- There'll be no car

627
01:37:50,847 --> 01:37:55,204
He won't even see you

628
01:37:56,407 --> 01:37:58,967
I can tell him what I have
on FranzeI...

629
01:38:03,607 --> 01:38:05,563
in writing

630
01:38:08,647 --> 01:38:12,196
I feeI as if were
carrying a bag of diamonds

631
01:38:29,487 --> 01:38:33,036
You are pleased

632
01:38:33,527 --> 01:38:36,758
FranzeI made me look silly,
arranging our marriage

633
01:38:37,207 --> 01:38:40,438
It's me he wanted
to humiliate

634
01:38:40,887 --> 01:38:43,401
Did you ever notice the way
he used to look at me?

635
01:38:43,887 --> 01:38:46,764
How?.

636
01:38:47,207 --> 01:38:50,324
but lacked the nerve

637
01:38:50,767 --> 01:38:53,281
Prince Bolko von Teuss?

638
01:38:53,727 --> 01:38:58,242
No fuss, Countess.
It's vulgar

639
01:39:08,767 --> 01:39:11,724
Step back.

640
01:39:12,047 --> 01:39:15,482
Nooooo

641
01:39:20,407 --> 01:39:22,284
I'm loaded!
I won it at roulette

642
01:39:26,407 --> 01:39:30,605
The Gestapo...

643
01:39:31,527 --> 01:39:33,643
arrested him...

644
01:39:42,927 --> 01:39:47,317
He knew everything
about FranzeI

645
01:39:47,647 --> 01:39:52,038
What's the use of hiding?
I can see you anyway

646
01:40:29,127 --> 01:40:32,358
She's right

647
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:45,046
Account number: 00033

648
01:40:46,007 --> 01:40:48,567
were two senior
NSDAP officials

649
01:40:57,727 --> 01:40:59,922
Halt!

650
01:41:00,487 --> 01:41:02,079
" I, Hans Heinrich XV
Hochberg von Teuss...

651
01:41:02,407 --> 01:41:06,320
hereby consent...

652
01:41:06,647 --> 01:41:11,437
to, assignment of
all my property.

653
01:41:11,767 --> 01:41:15,123
The mentaI illness
which has affected...

654
01:41:28,607 --> 01:41:31,121
my son Franz Friedrich...

655
01:41:31,447 --> 01:41:32,800
all power of attorney
is therefore transferred...

656
01:41:35,447 --> 01:41:40,840
to my son Conrad...

657
01:41:42,527 --> 01:41:44,358
Signed: Hans Heinrich XV,
Prince of Pszczyna

658
01:41:45,047 --> 01:41:48,800
That still leaves
the sacked directors...

659
01:41:53,207 --> 01:41:55,163
and Polish miners,
and the pit floodings

660
01:41:55,487 --> 01:41:58,524
Discuss that with them
and with Count Conrad

661
01:41:58,847 --> 01:42:01,201
You heard?

662
01:42:01,527 --> 01:42:05,566
I only asked you...

663
01:42:05,887 --> 01:42:08,639
to prevent my brother
from going to Poland

664
01:42:08,967 --> 01:42:12,039
And how did you expect us
to stop him?

665
01:42:12,367 --> 01:42:15,120
We did so

666
01:42:15,447 --> 01:42:17,278
But why has he also
been put in prison?

667
01:42:17,607 --> 01:42:21,043
What will you do with him?

668
01:42:21,367 --> 01:42:22,800
I understand he has run up
large debts in Munich

669
01:42:23,127 --> 01:42:26,437
That will have to be
investigated

670
01:42:26,767 --> 01:42:27,995
I can settle all his bills

671
01:42:28,847 --> 01:42:34,558
You can't do anything, Prince

672
01:42:36,287 --> 01:42:39,996
Are you aware...

673
01:42:40,327 --> 01:42:43,842
all your powers
on the grounds...

674
01:42:44,167 --> 01:42:47,000
that you are of
unsound mind?

675
01:42:47,847 --> 01:42:52,795
The Reich Government...

676
01:42:53,127 --> 01:42:55,322
All that's left to you is
to remain in Germany...

677
01:42:55,847 --> 01:42:57,883
and await better days

678
01:42:58,207 --> 01:43:00,801
When they come

679
01:43:01,127 --> 01:43:03,243
Can I see my brother?

680
01:43:03,567 --> 01:43:07,685
It all went wrong

681
01:43:08,007 --> 01:43:13,525
You were to be sent back
to Munich

682
01:43:13,847 --> 01:43:16,041
I wanted you to...

683
01:43:16,367 --> 01:43:20,997
It all went wrong

684
01:43:21,327 --> 01:43:24,876
It all went wrong

685
01:43:25,207 --> 01:43:27,402
Whatever I've done has been
for the family

686
01:43:27,727 --> 01:43:32,164
They want to destroy us,
to strip us of everything

687
01:43:32,487 --> 01:43:33,886
Tell Father that they have
a precise plan

688
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:36,880
They intend to
take everything

689
01:43:39,247 --> 01:43:42,444
Tell Father that I'm the only one
who can save everything

690
01:43:42,767 --> 01:43:44,325
Only me.

691
01:43:44,647 --> 01:43:48,640
Don't look at me like that
I've done you no harm. It was them

692
01:43:48,967 --> 01:43:54,916
Them! Will you tell him?

693
01:43:57,047 --> 01:43:58,446
I won't tell him anything.
I'm here for good

694
01:44:00,127 --> 01:44:04,086
I'm given injections
to make me beter, they say

695
01:44:05,207 --> 01:44:08,563
I had an abscess. They say
they're treating me

696
01:44:11,447 --> 01:44:13,915
What are they doing to you?

697
01:44:14,687 --> 01:44:19,044
Treating me, they say,
but in fact poisoning me

698
01:44:19,367 --> 01:44:22,723
You'll get out. And go home

699
01:44:23,047 --> 01:44:26,834
Tell Father...
You won't forget?

700
01:44:27,167 --> 01:44:28,600
They have a plan.
Heiberg's behind it all

701
01:44:28,927 --> 01:44:30,644
You'll tell Father?
You won't forget?

702
01:44:30,967 --> 01:44:34,754
I'm sorry, FranzeI, but you
really have gone mad

703
01:44:35,287 --> 01:44:37,721
Don't ever say that to me.

704
01:44:44,007 --> 01:44:48,762
Ever!

705
01:44:49,087 --> 01:44:52,921
I first noticed when you
proclaimed your plans...

706
01:44:53,247 --> 01:44:58,526
and ranted about
the greatness of the family

707
01:44:58,847 --> 01:45:03,045
You'd already become unhinged

708
01:45:04,047 --> 01:45:06,686
I saw the way you looked at us
How you began to suspect us,

709
01:45:07,007 --> 01:45:09,999
to spy on us

710
01:45:28,007 --> 01:45:29,678
Everything had to be
absolutely normaI...

711
01:45:33,407 --> 01:45:36,126
because you'd become

712
01:46:51,287 --> 01:46:53,164
Normality's unhinged you

713
01:46:57,927 --> 01:47:00,521
Did you think you were
the most normaI of persons?

714
01:47:02,807 --> 01:47:04,843
Or the strongest?

715
01:47:22,367 --> 01:47:25,643
That no one could wring
your secrets from you?

716
01:47:25,967 --> 01:47:30,199
Drop your voice. These are
things no one knows about

717
01:47:30,527 --> 01:47:33,280
It was a little ulcer,
a pimple really

718
01:47:36,247 --> 01:47:39,284
I can't hear a thing!

719
01:47:40,487 --> 01:47:44,878
That wasn't nice.
not nice at all

720
01:47:48,887 --> 01:47:50,878
You tried to escape
by the back door...

721
01:47:53,127 --> 01:47:57,006
The bastards!

722
01:47:58,767 --> 01:48:02,202
They said
there'd be no problems

723
01:48:05,327 --> 01:48:08,444
If they ever cross
this border...

724
01:48:08,767 --> 01:48:11,440
Well?

725
01:48:13,727 --> 01:48:15,876
Bolko!

726
01:48:16,207 --> 01:48:20,166
Lay her on the bench!
Fetch some water!

727
01:48:21,527 --> 01:48:23,836
Halt! Stop him!

728
01:48:24,167 --> 01:48:26,806
They're here!

729
01:48:34,327 --> 01:48:36,522
Can you...

730
01:48:36,847 --> 01:48:41,637
Can you forgive me

731
01:48:43,007 --> 01:48:45,646
How did you know...

732
01:50:50,007 --> 01:50:51,486
I wanted to see you?

733
01:50:51,807 --> 01:50:54,241
I've always been curious
to know...

734
01:50:54,567 --> 01:50:58,242
You'll see

735
01:50:58,567 --> 01:51:03,118
Am I dreaming?

736
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:45,403
Your Highness!
Your Highness - here?

737
01:51:45,727 --> 01:51:49,197
Are you the director here?

738
01:51:49,807 --> 01:51:51,559
That's right. In charge
of the slippers

739
01:51:51,887 --> 01:51:53,286
You are in the vestibule...

740
01:51:53,607 --> 01:51:56,121
leading to the oldest
part of the palace

741
01:51:58,967 --> 01:52:01,036
There's ornamentation
that's Baroque, Rococo...

742
01:52:01,367 --> 01:52:04,325
In 1946, in accordance
with the will...

743
01:52:04,647 --> 01:52:05,762
Mother...

744
01:52:11,007 --> 01:52:13,236
Father, but what year?

745
01:52:25,887 --> 01:52:29,925
That miner was called Grela

746
01:52:30,247 --> 01:52:31,999
What are you laughing at?

747
01:52:32,327 --> 01:52:34,887
What was that dog called?

748
01:52:35,207 --> 01:52:37,163
It was FranzeI's favourite...
Remember?

749
01:52:40,527 --> 01:52:45,920
I don't remember either

750
01:52:46,647 --> 01:52:48,603
I don't remember anything...

751
01:53:02,207 --> 01:53:04,084
Quiet!
