1
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,729
You think you caught
me sleeping, don't you?

2
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:42,996
No.

3
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,866
No one in the village
sleeps in the day.

4
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:49,370
Except once in
a while in church on Sundays.

5
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,872
This is a normal village,
you see?

6
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:53,941
Just like any
village anywhere,

7
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:56,777
only it is
in Sicily.

8
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,013
My people live simply.

9
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,815
Work hard.

10
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,785
They plant seeds
when they should,

11
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:06,420
and with God's help,

12
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:09,957
those seeds grow as
they should.

13
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:12,360
And it follows
that in due time,

14
00:03:12,393 --> 00:03:14,395
we harvest our crops

15
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,797
and our babies.

16
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,900
Crops and babies.

17
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,002
A normal village.

18
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,172
That is, this was
a normal village,

19
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,875
but not since
the trouble came.

20
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,144
Jessica.

21
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:33,080
The new midwife.

22
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,016
A bit of fluff,
a lock of hair,

23
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,017
a fleeting smile,

24
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,986
a wisp of a girl.

25
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:41,455
A wisp of an American girl,

26
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,526
one of nature's more
formidable accidents.

27
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,097
What has she done
to my people?

28
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,131
Well...

00:03:57,104 --> 00:03:58,306
(HORN BEEPING)

30
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,151
She has reshaped
the course of business.

(HORN BEEPING)

32
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,228
Be still, darling.

33
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,632
FATHER ANTONIO: She has
hopelessly tangled
communications.

34
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:30,971
My sister's best teapot.

35
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:35,876
WOMAN: Beppi?

36
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,611
Beppi, have you
seen my teapot?

37
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,547
Uh...

38
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:44,852
FATHER ANTONIO: And because
of her, property owners are
denied their lawful rights.

(HORN BEEPING)

40
00:04:56,364 --> 00:05:00,934
She has caused
the downward curve
in our farm programs.

41
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,806
(HORN BEEPING)

42
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:10,110
Of all the husbands,
there is only one you
could point to with pride,

43
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,581
His Honor, the mayor
of the village.

44
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:20,320
But then, as has been said,
to fast when you're
not hungry, what is it?

45
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:25,993
Meanwhile, every other husband
is dreaming of
a banquet.

46
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,599
Oh, Lord, we are in trouble.

47
00:05:33,233 --> 00:05:34,167
Hello, Father!

48
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,004
I'll talk to you later.

49
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,105
Hello, Jessica!

50
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:45,212
Where are you going?

51
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,313
Signor Risino.

52
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,516
My fist consignment on my own.

53
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,484
Oh, your first test.

54
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,752
Every woman in the village

55
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:54,788
will be watching
to see how you do, my child.

56
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,856
Does that worry you?

57
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,559
I'm a good nurse, Father.

58
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,795
Yes, but it is not as a nurse
that my people will judge you.

59
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,330
Ah, yes, I know.

60
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,666
Jessica Brown Visconti.

61
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,700
Girl midwife.

62
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,103
A most unusual midwife.

63
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,840
Because I'm an American?

64
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,074
Oh, no,
not at all.

65
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,709
I'm not a Sicilian

66
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:18,178
and they accepted me
as their own.

67
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,149
But there are
other things about you,
unusual in a midwife.

68
00:06:24,652 --> 00:06:26,119
Jessica, do you mind?

69
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,155
Why did you
come here?

70
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:30,390
Oh, I don't know, Father.

71
00:06:30,424 --> 00:06:31,859
Oh, it's all right.

72
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:33,293
You don't
have to tell me.

73
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:34,428
Oh, no, no, I...

74
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:36,797
I really mean
I don't know.

75
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,932
You see, all my life,

76
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,534
I've been
making plans.

77
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,270
As a student nurse,
I planned to be head nurse.

78
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:46,139
Then one day in the corridor,
on the second floor of

79
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,842
the Passavant Hospital
in Chicago, Illinois,

80
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:52,145
I met a young medical student,
Carlo Visconti.

81
00:06:52,179 --> 00:06:54,748
So I had to make new plans.

82
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,817
We were married
in his mother's home
in Palermo,

83
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:00,488
and everything went
just as we planned,
the wedding, the reception,

84
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,591
setting off together
on our honeymoon.

85
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:08,428
The only thing we didn't plan
was the tree that had fallen
across the road,

86
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,631
and Carlo
was driving much too fast.

87
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,967
He died

88
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:17,370
and I came out of it
without a scratch.

89
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:21,041
After that, I didn't
make any more plans.

90
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,914
So, when your letter came to
the hospital...

91
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,150
Well, here I am.

92
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,919
Ah, that's Priscilla.

93
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,821
They told me about her.

94
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,590
"Priscilla, to Father Antonio,"

95
00:07:36,624 --> 00:07:38,792
"in gratitude for his help,"

96
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,695
"from the boys
of the third company,."

97
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,597
"Fifth Army, USA."

98
00:07:43,631 --> 00:07:44,932
Yes.

99
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:50,270
Your American boys are,
are so generous,
so enthusiastic.

100
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,573
And our girls were so pretty.

101
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:53,641
Oh, well.

102
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,342
That was then.

103
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,711
Have you ever thought of
marrying again?

104
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:00,814
Of course I have, Father,
but I've been too busy.

105
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:01,982
Uh-huh.

106
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,416
Let's see,
let's see.

107
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,653
What single men have we?

108
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:08,355
For one,
there's Beppi Toriello,

109
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,357
the messaggero municipale,

110
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,492
who owns the wine shop
with his sister.

111
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,628
You mean the teapot?

112
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,730
- You know him?
- Mm-hmm.

113
00:08:16,764 --> 00:08:18,131
You're right, you're right.

114
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:19,733
No, no, no,
he won't do at all.

115
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:23,003
Then, now, there is
Edmondo Raumo.

116
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,471
Who?

117
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,173
The marchese.

118
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,407
But no, no, no,
he's not right,
he's not right.

119
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,342
He's not like his father.

120
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:31,078
- He's all wrong.
- Really?

121
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,512
Why, Father?

122
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,047
(CART APPROACHING)

123
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:37,150
Then there is, uh...

124
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,185
Gianni!

125
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:45,726
Hello, Father.

126
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:47,060
How are you?

127
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,295
I'm well, Gianni.

128
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,529
This is Gianni Crupi.

129
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:50,964
Signora Visconti.

130
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,035
- Did you say Signora, Father?
- I did.

131
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,639
Signora Visconti is our new
midwife, from America.

132
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,407
Midwife, you?

133
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,943
To take care of other
people's babies?

134
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,212
What a waste, Signora.

135
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:09,016
I hope your trip
was a success, Gianni.

136
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,517
You've been gone, what?

137
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,719
Two weeks?

138
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,086
Anyway, a long time.

139
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,255
Too long, Father.

140
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,392
Yes, Nicolina
must think so, too.

141
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,795
She must be waiting for you,

142
00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:22,863
Nicolina.

143
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,997
Uh-huh.

144
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:25,432
- FATHER ANTONIO: Gianni!
- Huh?

145
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:27,067
Oh.

146
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,903
And Signor Risino must be
wondering where I am.

147
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:32,072
It's going to be a lucky baby.

148
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,908
The first face it sees in
the world will be yours.

149
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:36,777
Well, it might not be
if I don't hurry.

150
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,584
If it's a boy, he'll wait.

151
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,710
FATHER ANTONIO: Jessica.

152
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,579
And one more thing.

153
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,848
Gianni Crupi
is very fortunate.

154
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:19,186
He's going to inherit
all the Lombardo farmland
one day.

155
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:23,256
Old Maria Lombardo
thinks of him
as her grandson.

156
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,460
And as a matter of fact,
he's going to marry
her granddaughter Nicolina,

157
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:28,962
- in a few weeks.
- Nicolina.

158
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:31,732
Ah, yes, the gentle,
pretty little girl.

159
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:33,834
Yes, with the strong,
big grandmother.

160
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,770
Don't worry, Father,
I'm not that lonely.

161
00:10:36,804 --> 00:10:38,672
I won't cause trouble.

162
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,307
My child, you are trouble.

163
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,842
- Mama, Mama!
- Yes, dear.

164
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,276
Father, pray for me.

165
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,845
I will.

166
00:10:44,878 --> 00:10:48,148
Ever since you came I've been
praying, for everybody.

167
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,151
Gianni!

168
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,219
Nicolina!

169
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,768
Hi, Gianni.

170
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:08,802
Rosario.

171
00:11:11,571 --> 00:11:13,473
Oh, Gianni,
where have you been?

172
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,541
Having fun.

173
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:15,675
Gianni.

174
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:17,110
Oh, I have missed you so.

175
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:23,383
(CHUCKLING)

176
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,033
What took you so long?

177
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:44,805
My dear child, I was bringing
to terms the sharpest
olive dealer in Messina.

178
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,406
Did you get him?

179
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:50,210
When I finished with him,
even your stiff-necked
grandmother would be pleased.

180
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:51,779
Gianni!

181
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,018
NICOLINA: Gianni, don't.

182
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,252
GIANNI: Why not, little one?

183
00:11:59,286 --> 00:12:00,653
NICOLINA: Someone will hear.

184
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,855
GIANNI: Then don't struggle.

185
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,697
(CLEARING THROAT)

186
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,467
Gianni, I meant what took you
so long on the curve
by the wheat field?

187
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,104
I saw you talking with
Father Antonio and Jessica.

188
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:21,108
- Who?
- Signora Visconti,
the American girl.

189
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,675
Isn't she pretty?

190
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,011
I didn't notice.

191
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,946
- You didn't?
- Why should I?

192
00:12:25,979 --> 00:12:27,948
A married woman?
What is she to me?

193
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:29,682
She's not married,
she's a widow.

194
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,384
A widow?
Really?

195
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,855
Then her name is Jessica.

196
00:12:34,888 --> 00:12:37,624
Gianni, what are you thinking?

197
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,894
I was just wondering
how she must feel.

198
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:41,962
Who?

199
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,964
Jessica, the midwife.

200
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:49,436
To have known a man's love,
to have his arms around her,
his mouth on hers,

201
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,372
then not have it anymore.

202
00:12:52,405 --> 00:12:53,673
She never did have it.

203
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:56,643
Her husband was killed on
their wedding day.

204
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,745
GIANNI: Oh...

205
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,947
A virgin, huh?

206
00:13:04,684 --> 00:13:05,685
(CHUCKLING)

207
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,426
Signora Lombardo, we came
about the midwife.

208
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,662
You told us that we
should go and watch.

209
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,665
I mean, help the midwife.

210
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:21,201
You know, Signora Risino
is in labor.

211
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:51,231
Oh, Signor Risino, not yet.

212
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,299
There's nothing to
worry about, though.

213
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,367
I hope you're not gonna bother
your wife now.

214
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:56,169
- No.
- Thank you.

215
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,271
This is not the time
for a husband.

216
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,040
Later, after the baby comes,
yes, but right now,

217
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,942
it's your wife's
time and mine.

218
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:03,743
You understand?

219
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:04,945
Well, then you
go back to work.

220
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:10,583
I am hungry.

221
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:11,985
Now you know better than that.

222
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,853
You know you'll just
be in the way.

223
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:14,922
Now go back to work.

224
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,891
Why not?

225
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:23,563
Oh, it's just a scratch.

226
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:24,597
Go back.

227
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:29,602
I want to see my wife.

228
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,339
All right.
Go ahead.

229
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:48,855
Holy mother.

230
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,757
What are you doing here?

231
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,192
I came to see you.

232
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,260
I don't know.

233
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,262
What for?

234
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,529
Well, the baby, I mean.

235
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:57,597
What's the matter?

236
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,532
Do you think I don't know
how to have a baby?

237
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,801
Who do you think had
the other eight?

238
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,403
You?

239
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,504
Signora Visconti?

240
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:09,809
Tell him to leave.

241
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,781
ANTONIO: Does it hurt?

242
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,483
"Does it hurt?"

243
00:15:16,516 --> 00:15:18,051
Throw him out!

244
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:19,352
Come.

245
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:31,631
To leave his work
in the first place.

246
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:32,765
Why?

247
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,501
He's never done it before.

248
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,303
Why this time?

249
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:38,005
Signora, can you come down?

250
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,406
I want to
tell you something.

251
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,116
JESSICA: Now go!
Shoo!

252
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,583
Shoo!

253
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,953
And don't come back.

254
00:15:53,987 --> 00:15:56,189
I'll send one of the children
to let you know.

255
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:57,991
Now, go!
Go, shoo!

256
00:15:58,025 --> 00:15:59,126
Shoo!

257
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,332
Well, we can't blame her.

258
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,466
She put him out.

259
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,101
Yes, but did she have to?

260
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:09,402
We are not here to
judge her looks,

261
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:11,104
but how good
a midwife she is.

262
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,972
But Signora Lombardo,
what if she's good?

263
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,174
She won't be.
Why should she?

264
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:15,808
She doesn't have to.

265
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:19,112
Would you work the bakery with
your husband if you were as
pretty as the midwife?

266
00:16:19,146 --> 00:16:20,580
Of course
you would not.

267
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,061
She washed their faces.

268
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,095
So neat.

269
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,329
No dust.

270
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:38,365
Hmm.
Smells good.

271
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,390
(BABY CRYING)

272
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:17,204
Already?

273
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:18,971
She usually takes days.

274
00:17:20,006 --> 00:17:21,274
We came to help.

275
00:17:21,308 --> 00:17:22,575
She had no trouble?

276
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:24,477
None.

277
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:26,713
She always did before with
the old midwife.

278
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,018
(GIGGLING)

279
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:35,222
WOMAN: Bella always
had trouble before

280
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,556
with the old midwife.

281
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,498
(BABY CRYING)

282
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,367
Do you love babies, Signora?

283
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:51,804
I will love my
great-grandchild.

284
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:55,408
I will love the baby of my
granddaughter Nicolina
and Gianni Crupi.

285
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,877
And I love them all.

286
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,648
They're so wise.

287
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,616
They come into the world
knowing at once

288
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,285
where food is
and how to get it.

289
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,523
Thank you for wanting to help.

290
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,595
Well, Signora?

291
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,129
I was wrong.

292
00:18:16,163 --> 00:18:17,630
Do you think she's good.

293
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:19,266
- Worse.
- Worse?

294
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:23,370
She's good, she's honest
and she loves her work.

295
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:24,704
She's impossible.

296
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,526
How did it go?

297
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,060
- Fine.
- Did anything go wrong?

298
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,431
Not a thing, Mamma Parigi,
everything went beautifully.

299
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,632
Ah, that's what I heard.

300
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,667
Oh, well.

301
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:57,437
We have other things wrong
in the village this morning.

302
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,538
Oh?

303
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,107
Let me take that.

304
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,476
Oh!
Hey, heavy, isn't it?

305
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,844
You must be so tired.

306
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:12,585
You were smart to grab me away
from all the other ladies

307
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,188
who wanted my
services as housekeeper.

308
00:19:15,222 --> 00:19:17,390
You certainly
gave Maria Lombardo

309
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:20,092
and those other gossips
a shock.

310
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,861
I heard all about this.

311
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,863
But how could you hear?

312
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,333
When you're as deaf
as I am,

313
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:28,000
you make
a special effort.

314
00:19:28,034 --> 00:19:30,603
I knew there was something.

315
00:19:30,637 --> 00:19:33,240
Old Crupi's got
blood poisoning.

316
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:33,706
Who?

317
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,608
Old Crupi.

318
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:38,110
The gardener
up at the chateau.

319
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,079
He's the uncle
of that boy Gianni

320
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:43,516
who's going to marry
Maria Lombardo's
granddaughter.

321
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,551
You met Gianni, didn't you?

322
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,489
That boy, Gianni...

323
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:51,291
If I were only 55 again.

324
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,125
What about the uncle?

325
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,727
MAMMA: He cut his hand.

326
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,230
Gianni stopped by to ask you
to go and have a look at it,

327
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,631
but don't you do it.

328
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,733
Can you reach the cups?

329
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:06,239
Blood poisoning or not,
Crupi's an old grouch.

330
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,674
The coffee, Mamma Parigi.

331
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:09,208
Hates doctors.

332
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:12,044
Probably hates midwives
even worse.

333
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:14,981
Won't pay his bills,
won't even die.

334
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,616
Ooh, he's so mean.

335
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:19,286
Ah, there.

336
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,755
All the same, I'd better go up
to the castle to see him.

337
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,191
(SCOFFS) He'll throw you out
for your pains.

338
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,379
- Signor Crupi?
- That's right.

339
00:21:19,412 --> 00:21:21,448
Hello, I'm Jessica Visconti.

340
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,549
Is that so?

341
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,750
The new midwife.

342
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,852
There must be
some mistake, Signora.

343
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,588
I am not having a baby.

344
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,822
A pity, sir.

345
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,758
However, I came about
something else.

346
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,693
Your nephew, Gianni.

347
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,695
My nephew Gianni is an idiot.

348
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,630
That may be,

349
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,299
but he left word asking me
to see to your hand.

350
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,301
It's already been
seen to by me.

351
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:44,471
Oh, please.
Won't you let me?

352
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,638
No.

353
00:21:45,672 --> 00:21:47,774
I won't let you
and that's that.

354
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:50,109
Are you afraid of a bill?

355
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,379
Are you really
that stingy?

356
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,647
Yes, I am, yes!

357
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,215
JESSICA: Are you afraid
I'll hurt you?

358
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:58,985
That's right, I'm afraid of
that, too, yes.

359
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:00,653
Now, please
leave me alone, will you?

360
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:01,788
Go, hmm?

361
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,156
All right, I'm sorry to have
bothered you.

362
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,027
Uh, Signor Crupi?

363
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,731
Aren't you supposed to be
the best gardener around here?

364
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,900
I am the best
gardener anywhere.

365
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:15,267
Really?

366
00:22:15,301 --> 00:22:16,436
CRUPI: Why?

367
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,637
Oh, I don't know.

368
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,373
Putting all those
tulips and stock

369
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:24,143
and wallflower
in the same bed,
mixing all those colors.

370
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,412
CRUPI: What's wrong with it?

371
00:22:25,445 --> 00:22:27,380
It clashes.

372
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,115
Clashes?
You talk to me about clashes?

373
00:22:29,148 --> 00:22:30,850
Come back here, come back here
and look at that.

374
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:32,051
- Look at that, Signora.
- Wow, really?

375
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,152
You know what they say about
my borders, Signora?

376
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,388
The richest borders
in the whole of Sicily,

377
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:36,589
- that's what they say.
- Ah, really?

378
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,991
And then those rich borders
are every color
of the rainbow.

379
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,227
I've had tulips as red as
a drunkard's nose,

380
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,096
with iris as yellow
as the sun right beside them.

381
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,264
I have red geraniums,

382
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:47,834
white geraniums
and blue luberias.
Blue, mind you!

383
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:48,701
All on the same border.

384
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:50,403
Uh, that...

385
00:22:50,437 --> 00:22:52,338
That can't be a garden
you're talking about.

386
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,339
It sounds more like a jungle.

387
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,575
Jungle?
You're too ignorant to know

388
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,710
that it's the most
beautiful garden.

389
00:22:57,744 --> 00:22:59,846
Beautiful to
the eye, to the heart.

390
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,648
There is the bee to think of
too, you know?

391
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:03,182
He uses flowers for food

392
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:06,453
and he likes
variety in his diet,
just like the rest of us.

393
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:09,388
Just as we do,
to begin with, buttercups,

394
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:14,393
for main dish, chrysanthemums,
for dessert, zinnias.

395
00:23:14,427 --> 00:23:17,396
I plant my gardens more
for bees than for people!

396
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,567
They're a lot
less ungrateful.

397
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,402
And God knows they are more
intelligent, hmm?

398
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:28,074
It's only infected,
nothing serious.

399
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,610
But I'd like you not
to use it for a few days.

400
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:32,645
You tricked me, hmm?

401
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:33,780
Yes.

402
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:38,885
Signor, I'm not a doctor,
but if you don't mind,

403
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:40,787
you don't look
like a well man.

404
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,689
I am not.

405
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:47,259
- Well, then would you...
- No, no, I would not.

406
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:48,861
I suppose you expect

407
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:51,197
to be paid
for this?

408
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,665
Certainly.

409
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:53,666
How much?

410
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,935
To be allowed to come back
to see your garden.

(GRUMBLING)

412
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,272
That's too much.

413
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,308
Then consider
the account paid in full.

414
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:09,916
However, if you
happen to be passing by,

415
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,452
you can
always come in, hmm?
I am here every day.

416
00:24:13,486 --> 00:24:15,622
Thank you.
I'd love to.

how does it look?

00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,645
You think we have
enough lights?

422
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,846
That's right,
if the bride gets

423
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,714
a look at the groom,
she could change her mind.

424
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:45,317
Do you think this hem
looks crooked?

425
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,086
Oh, why bother?

426
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,488
If Gianni is like Musudino,
the dress will be in shreds
by wedding night, anyway.

427
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:50,623
Really?
Why?

428
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,793
Because men are so nervous.

- Good morning.

Thank you, Jessica.

You must hold your husband's
memory lightly

453
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:43,576
to give away
his gift so easily.

454
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,777
Why?

455
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,312
Does it dishonor the dead to
believe in the living?

Of course not.

00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:52,151
But we have customs here

mean to offend.

Yeah.

I changed my mind.

00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:18,911
Are you beginning to like her?

00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,279
No, I'm beginning to
hate her.

No, he's off in the woods
with his dogs.

All right, then, Annamaria,
I'll wander out.
Perhaps I'll run into him.

Not at all.

536
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:40,186
As a matter of fact,
I brought a little list.

537
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,188
Quite the little list.

538
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:43,589

I said no to everything

539
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,624

00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,699
Old Bugianni
died last month.

544
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,103
His wife cries because she
cannot afford a headstone.

545

to a dead man?

546

No, no headstone.

Nicolina Lombardo
and Gianni Crupi.

549
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:10,950
You know I never go to church
anyway, so the answer is no.

550
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,919
I will not go to the wedding.

551
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,453

552
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:17,890
The mortgage for
old Vantorte's farm.

553
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:18,958

- No.

won't he do now, Father?

Me?
Why me?

572
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:05,637
Because you're an obstinate

more like you every day.

going off to wars

deny themselves

to their husbands

677
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,483
and pretty soon,
their husbands stayed home.

678
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:46,818
You mean the women
denied themselves?

679
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,454
This couldn't happen here.

00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,088

Never.

00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,291

682
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,892
They had a strike.

683
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,395
A kind of...
A sit up strike.

684
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,864

00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,162
that a wife has
no moral right

717
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:06,064
to deny her husband.

718
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:09,000
Therefore, there is
nothing more to be said.

719
00:36:09,034 --> 00:36:10,269
But you'll say it.

720
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,278
I am older than you

721
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:23,181
and I regret that
I've led you astray, but...

722
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:26,117
I can hardly wait
until Musudino starts
whining around.

723
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,155
If I say yes,
it means no more babies.

724
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,291
That's right, no more babies.

725
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:32,558
And no more...

726
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,093
No more.

727
00:36:35,126 --> 00:36:36,295
But it's Saturday.

728
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,629
Lucia!

729
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:40,031
All right,
all right, I vote yes.

730
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:41,933
And Nicolina, too?
Will she be with us?

731
00:36:41,967 --> 00:36:43,669
Yes.

732
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,237
I vote yes.

733
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:47,373
And her answer will be yes.

734
00:36:47,406 --> 00:36:48,440
Strike!

735
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,501
All the women
called a strike today.

736
00:37:15,534 --> 00:37:16,468
A strike?

737
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,704
That's interesting.

738
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,138
Against what?

739
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,374
Against sex.

740
00:37:22,408 --> 00:37:23,375
Hmm?

741
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:25,977
Never mind.

742
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,349
You mean Gianni is not to
make love to me at all?

743
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:33,151
Only for a time,
only for a time.

744
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,720
After all, you'll be together,

745
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,922
you'll have fun
and laughter together.

746
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:38,189
There's a great deal
more in marriage

747
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,091
than just physical love.

748
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:43,462
That is something
that you learn later
to enjoy more fully.

749
00:37:43,495 --> 00:37:46,264
You've got a great many
years ahead of you, Nicolina.

750
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,535
And if Gianni loves you,
he'll wait until you're ready.

751
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,269
But I'm ready now.

752
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,406
I ask this of
you now, Nicolina.

753
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,343
It will be even more difficult
for Gianni.

754
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,145
But it's good for a young man
to learn self-control.

755
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,913
He'll be all
the better for it.

756
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:05,884
Now, will you promise
me this, Nicolina?

757
00:38:09,054 --> 00:38:11,590
NICOLINA: I will attempt it,
Grandmother.

758
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,426
Well, the attempt
of a Lombardo is often
better than

759
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,562
the accomplishment of others.

760
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:18,564
I know as long as you're
under my roof,

761
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:21,467
you'll keep your promise.

762
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,936
You may find me wiser
than you think.

763
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:28,507
Don't forget, while Gianni
is dreaming of
possessing his wife,

764
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,410
he has little time
to dream of anyone else.

765
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,244
Many wives have
discovered that.

766
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,181
But there is no one else to
dream about.

767
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:38,484
I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

768
00:38:38,517 --> 00:38:41,152
That's another discovery many
wives have made.

769
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,320
- Grandmother?
- Yes?

770
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:44,590
Are you thinking
about Jessica?

771
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:48,293
I know she's beautiful,
but Gianni wouldn't.

772
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,029
- He loves me.
- Oh, love.

773
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,865
Love is for Sundays.

774
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:57,268
Never forget,
no matter how much
in love a man may be,

775
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:59,037
he still scratches an itch.

776
00:39:00,406 --> 00:39:01,907
You've got a lot
to learn, Nicolina,

777
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:05,611
and the rest of
your life to learn it,
but for now, for now,

778
00:39:05,644 --> 00:39:07,579
you promise me this, huh?

779
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,147
Yeah?

780
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,549
Yes.

781
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:11,583
I guess.

782
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,184
That's good.

783
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:14,620
That's very good.

784
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:19,825
MUSUDINO: Open the door,
Lucia!

785
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,627
I'm going to eternity,
you understand?

786
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,294
What do I care
where you go to sleep?

787
00:39:23,328 --> 00:39:25,263
Take your silk off
and go and sleep in the oven.

788
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:40,779
Why did I wait 'til
after nine children?

789
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,448
Why didn't I think
of this before?

790
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,952
(LAUGHING)

791
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:49,020
This is not the first time
it happened, Filippo.

792
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:51,490
You won't believe this,
but it happened
a long time ago,

793
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:52,323
in Greece.

794
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,825
A story called Lysistrata.

795
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:56,261
FILIPPO: Come to bed.

796
00:39:56,294 --> 00:39:57,596
As it seems, there were
these women,

797
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,698
and their husbands
kept going off to war,

798
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:03,201
so they decided to have
a strike, and pretty soon...

799
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,403
- (SMACKING)
- (SHOUTING) Oh! Filippo!

800
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:07,172
- (SMACKING)
- (SPEAKING SOFTLY) Filippo...

801
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:19,350
(MUSIC PLAYING)

802
00:41:20,879 --> 00:41:22,948
(SPEAKING IN LATIN)

803
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:48,306
My children...

804
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,341
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

805
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,820
(WHISPERING)
No, that's
the marchese's chair.

806
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:03,188
What?

807
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:05,390
GIANNI: You can't sit there,
it's the marchese's chair.

808
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,058
Come.

809
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:17,268
There has been a promise of
marriage between Gianni Crupi

810
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,237
and Nicolina Lombardo,

811
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,106
both of
this parish,

812
00:42:21,139 --> 00:42:23,909
to take place
this coming Saturday.

813
00:42:23,942 --> 00:42:26,411
This is the second
publication of the banns.

814
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:37,288
My sermon today is
inspired from the epistle of.

815
00:42:37,322 --> 00:42:40,525
St. Paul to the Ephesians,
chapter five.

816
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:48,767
"Let women be subject
to their husbands,
as to the Lord:."

817
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,370
"Because the husband
is the head of the wife,"

818
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:59,110
"so also let the wives
be subject to their husbands
in all things."

819
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,050
Father Antonio was great.

820
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,925
But I tried, see?

821
00:43:13,959 --> 00:43:15,460
You must try harder,

822
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,929
and just remember tonight,
when he climbs into bed,

823
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:19,297
I'm behind you
all the way.

824
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:24,202
He did nothing
but talk of you.

825
00:43:24,235 --> 00:43:26,437
And this is the first time
in 30 years my uncle

826
00:43:26,471 --> 00:43:28,306
said anything good
about anybody.

827
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:31,777
He is a mean old man.

828
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,612
Oh, no, he's a wise old man.

829
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:35,947
Good morning.

830
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,521
Ah, how are my children?

831
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:44,956
Come on, everybody.

832
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,091
March.

833
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:50,495
Antonio.

834
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,142
You look well,
Signora Lombardo.

835
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,811
Oh...

836
00:44:05,844 --> 00:44:07,946
What's worrying you?

837
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,048
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

838
00:44:10,081 --> 00:44:13,184
And you, my dear, you look
like a girl of 18.

839
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,020
Really?

840
00:44:17,723 --> 00:44:19,457
Nicolina?

841
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,992
Your wedding comes
closer and closer,

842
00:44:21,026 --> 00:44:21,993
I'm so happy for you.

843
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:23,128
Oh, thank you, Jessica.

844
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,395
Nicolina!

845
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:26,564
Gianni, come.

846
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:27,632
Goodbye, Jessica.

847
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:28,700
Come.

848
00:44:28,734 --> 00:44:29,801
Goodbye.

849
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:41,646
Hey ho!

850
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,285
(VESPA STARTING)

851
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:56,694
(MUSIC PLAYING)

852
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,422
Drink.

853
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:58,957
I don't want to get drunk.

854
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,861
I don't want
to get drunk, I...

855
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,054
Oh, it's a proud day, Father.

856
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:33,491
I only wish my Roberto
had lived to see it.

857
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,962
Your Roberto would have
outdrunk them all.

858
00:46:36,995 --> 00:46:40,365
Yes, outdrunk,
outshouted and outloved.

859
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,476
Oh.

860
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,616
Come on, let's dance.

861
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,452
Come on.

862
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:27,445
It's all right.

863
00:47:27,478 --> 00:47:28,713
They're not married.

864
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,119
It's Edmondo!

865
00:47:36,421 --> 00:47:38,423
- Good evening.
- Why, you came.

866
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:41,159
- Hey, Father.
- What a pleasant
surprise, my son.

867
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:42,093
Not at all.

868
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,630
How could I miss the marriage
of my goddaughter,

869
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,565
to the nephew of my
old friend Crupi?

870
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:51,802
By the way, where is
my old friend Crupi?

871
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:55,941
He had a small errand to do,
but he'll be along.

872
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:58,509
He'd better.

873
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:01,012
Signora, will you have
a glass of wine with me?

874
00:48:01,046 --> 00:48:01,947
Of course.

875
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:17,128
Just look at my wife.

876
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:18,729
You're jealous, Luigi?

877
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:19,797
Jealous?

878
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:20,999
Not at all.

879
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,472
Had the American
girl been here,

880
00:48:27,505 --> 00:48:29,874
Nunzia would have been
on the sidelines.

881
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,847
When I left, Jessica was
dressing to come.

882
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:39,617
Waiting for that.

883
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:40,986
He was supposed
to pick her up.

884
00:48:51,296 --> 00:48:52,730
(KNOCKING)

885
00:48:56,801 --> 00:48:58,569
Oh, Signor Crupi.

886
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,171
But I thought...

887
00:49:00,205 --> 00:49:01,506
Where's Rosario?

888
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,574
Drunk, if he has any sense.

889
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:07,945
Aren't you ready yet?

890
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,481
Hmm.

891
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,887
Is that for me?

892
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:18,990
Of course it's for you.

893
00:49:19,024 --> 00:49:20,425
Oh.

894
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:23,328
Well, good.

895
00:49:23,361 --> 00:49:25,396
Then you can have this.

896
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,465
- Ah.
- Ah... (CHUCKLING)

897
00:49:30,068 --> 00:49:31,702
Oh...

898
00:49:31,736 --> 00:49:33,371
- Okay?
- Okay.

899
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:36,374
(COUGHING)

900
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,808
You'll catch cold.

901
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:38,743
Come on.

902
00:49:38,776 --> 00:49:41,946
- Oh, oh, oh, oh...
Wait a minute.
- Hm?

903
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:45,316
For you.

904
00:49:47,785 --> 00:49:50,488
(CHUCKLING) Oh.

905
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,329
And so I won't catch a cold.

906
00:50:00,665 --> 00:50:02,267
This is how we do it.

907
00:50:05,336 --> 00:50:06,537
We go.

908
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,784
My children,

909
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:23,154
I have no words of wisdom for
you, no warning.

910
00:50:23,188 --> 00:50:25,390
Not even a wedding gift.

911
00:50:25,423 --> 00:50:27,392
Only a wish.

912
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:30,461

913
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:36,134

comes with giving

(MUSIC PLAYING)

943
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:50,235
Oh, look at my
old friend Crupi!

944
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,194
Never mind. Forget her.
Come on.

945
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,973
I told Rosario
not to bring her.

946
00:53:29,006 --> 00:53:31,041
I know, Rosario told me.

947
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:33,244
How did Old Crupi know?

948
00:53:33,278 --> 00:53:35,280
In the village,
everybody knows everything.

949
00:53:35,313 --> 00:53:36,247
Isn't it so?

950
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:38,649
I've never seen her before.

951
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:41,786
Does she belong here?

952
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,255
That, my boy,
is quite a question.

953
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:26,591
(GRUNTING)

954
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:43,508
My Roberto always said it
wasn't a good wedding unless
there was a fight.

955
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:45,743
But I don't like it.

956
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:49,046
What do you expect
of a village

957
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:51,516
that sleeps with
a volcano for a pillow?

958
00:55:54,752 --> 00:55:56,253
(CRASHING)

959
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:10,501
(GRUNTING)

960
00:56:37,194 --> 00:56:38,195
Guess what?

961
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:40,431
What?

962
00:56:46,837 --> 00:56:48,372
More wine, Jessica?

963
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,173
Should I?

964
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:50,975
It's up to you.

965
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:52,910
Then I shouldn't.

966
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:54,445
How did you know my name?

967
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:57,682
Father Antonio told me all
about you.

968
00:56:57,715 --> 00:56:59,984
I'll take the wine.

969
00:57:00,017 --> 00:57:02,252
Like what did he tell you?

970
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:04,321
That every man
in this village wants you.

971
00:57:04,354 --> 00:57:05,523
Oh, that.

972
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:08,092
But he didn't tell me
which man you want.

973
00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:09,827
I don't want any of them.

974
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,095
Oh! (CHUCKLING)

975
00:57:11,128 --> 00:57:12,730
Do you mean to tell me

976
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:17,702
that not one of those 10
muscular young fellows
in there has caught your eye?

977
00:57:17,735 --> 00:57:20,204
Being young
isn't all that good.

978
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,607
It's much better
when you're older.

979
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,574
- Yes.
- I mean, you've got all that

980
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,676
gray around
and I don't know,

981
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:28,613
your mind is better when
it's older, or it ought to be.

982
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:29,980
And your feelings are finer.

983
00:57:31,415 --> 00:57:33,017
So I am the one you want.

984
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:34,284
I thought so.

985
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:36,320
But why else did you bring me
out to the garden?

986
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,835
Whenever you're
ready, my dear.

987
00:57:50,868 --> 00:57:52,336
Are you tired, dear?

988
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,705
A little, but if
you'd rather stay...

989
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:59,009
Oh, no, I was just marking
time, waiting for you.

990
00:57:59,043 --> 00:58:00,077
Thank you, Pascale.

991
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,411
Antonio.

992
00:58:01,445 --> 00:58:03,514
Oh, yes, of course.

993
00:58:03,548 --> 00:58:04,715
(LAUGHING)

994
00:58:10,087 --> 00:58:13,023
(MUSIC PLAYING)

995
00:58:30,474 --> 00:58:32,176
Mm?

996
00:58:32,209 --> 00:58:33,578
Mm-hmm.

997
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:35,913
Ooh, I love wine.

998
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:47,324
All right.

999
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:50,360
Your name is Giuseppe

1000
00:58:50,394 --> 00:58:55,165
and you own fishing
boats in Taormina

1001
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:56,133
and in the morning,

1002
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:59,536
you're going off
with your fishing fleet

1003
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:01,438
and you won't be back
for several weeks.

1004
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,309
What else about you?

1005
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:07,077
Nothing.

1006
00:59:07,111 --> 00:59:09,479
Except that I am a lucky man.

1007
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:12,883
Because you're going away
in the morning?

1008
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,854
Because I met you tonight.

1009
00:59:18,723 --> 00:59:20,124
Oh.

1010
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,461
Are you sure you're
a fisherman, Giuseppe?

1011
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:27,264
Of course.
Why not?

1012
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:28,933
I don't know.

1013
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:29,967
It sounds...

1014
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:36,674
It sounds...

1015
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:38,108
Dull, I don't know.

1016
00:59:38,142 --> 00:59:39,343
And you don't...

1017
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:43,147
If you know what I mean.

1018
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,481
Fishing?

1019
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:46,751
Dull?

1020
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:49,519
You mean it's exciting?

1021
00:59:49,553 --> 00:59:53,323
If you go after game fish,
a fighting fish,

1022
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:56,293
a fish worth taking.

1023
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,262
Oh, yes...
Oh, yes, it's exciting.

1024
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:04,268
It is not a rich man,
or a poor man,

1025
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:06,003
who catches a fish.

1026
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:09,173
It is a lucky man
who knows how to wait.

1027
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,076
Oh...

1028
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,178
That's so cruel.

1029
01:00:14,211 --> 01:00:15,913
Cruel?

1030
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,248
It is the fish that
comes to the hook.

1031
01:00:18,282 --> 01:00:21,418
The hook does not
seek out the fish.

1032
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,655
But the fish
hasn't got a chance.

1033
01:00:24,689 --> 01:00:28,158
What does the fish
need a chance for?

1034
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:29,727
If I don't take it,

1035
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,962
what would it do
with its life?

1036
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:35,365
Poor fish.

1037
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:36,366
What?

1038
01:00:39,136 --> 01:00:40,270
Never mind.

1039
01:00:43,741 --> 01:00:45,475
Ooh.

1040
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:46,610
I almost forgot.

1041
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:50,147
Are you married?

1042
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,149
No.

1043
01:00:53,751 --> 01:00:55,652
Engaged?

1044
01:00:55,686 --> 01:00:56,987
No.

1045
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,525
Mistress?

1046
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:03,027
(LAUGHING) No.

1047
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:05,996
Ah.

1048
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,065
Then nobody's gonna get hurt.

1049
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,241
(MEN SINGING)

1050
01:01:23,981 --> 01:01:25,015
Luigi, it's late.

1051
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,550
Close the shutters
and come to bed.

1052
01:01:32,456 --> 01:01:32,556
And that's why

1053
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:36,994
the wives were urging their
husbands to get drunk.

1054
01:01:37,027 --> 01:01:38,996
So they wouldn't be able to...

1055
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,397
Oh-ho!

1056
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:42,166
That's right.
Oh-ho!

1057
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:45,602
And it's going to be oh-ho
every night for months.

1058
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:46,703
You too, Nunzia?

1059
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,505
Me too what?

1060
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:50,808
Are you a part
of this conspiracy?

1061
01:01:50,841 --> 01:01:51,909
Certainly.

1062
01:01:51,942 --> 01:01:53,510
I'm a woman, am I not?

1063
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,245
You most
certainly are.

1064
01:01:58,082 --> 01:01:59,716
What are you looking at?

1065
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,085
A woman.

1066
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:03,087
A most desirable woman.

1067
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,989
Who?

1068
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:05,990
You, Nunzia.

1069
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:09,927
Luigi!

1070
01:02:13,097 --> 01:02:14,531
You've taken on

1071
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,902
the delicious savor
of forbidden fruit, Nunzia.

1072
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:21,371
Luigi, I...
I think you've gone mad.

1073
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:25,609
The Rubicon has been crossed,
the drawbridge raised.

1074
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:29,579
I must confess,
I find you at this moment
extremely desirable,

1075
01:02:29,613 --> 01:02:33,117
whether it is the moonlight,
the midwife,

1076
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:36,086
something has been done to me.

1077
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:39,289
There is this deliberate
challenge to me as a man.

1078
01:02:40,357 --> 01:02:41,558
I can't explain.

1079
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:44,294
There is no need to explain.

1080
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:59,276
Oh, Nicolina...

1081
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:00,945
Quiet, Grandmother
will hear us.

1082
01:03:00,978 --> 01:03:03,480
She will hear nothing that she
does not expect.

1083
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:04,614
But she will, she...

1084
01:03:07,484 --> 01:03:08,585
- Gianni?
- Huh?

1085
01:03:08,618 --> 01:03:09,753
Not now.

1086
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:10,855
Why not?

1087
01:03:13,757 --> 01:03:15,125
I'm sleepy.

1088
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:17,895
You've never been less sleepy
in your life.

1089
01:03:17,928 --> 01:03:20,397
We must talk!

1090
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,967
We must talk reasonably.

1091
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,668
Intelligently.

1092
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,737
Like two sensible people.

1093
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:29,073
Oh, Gianni.

1094
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:36,213
No, we can't.

1095
01:03:38,182 --> 01:03:39,917
GIANNI: Don't fight,
little one.

1096
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,118
I love you.

1097
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,186
NICOLINA: Yes.

1098
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,787
I promised Grandmother.

1099
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,123
Not under her roof, I said.

1100
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:47,724
Nicolina.

1101
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,427
Nicolina, let me
tell you something.

1102
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,163
All girls are afraid at first,
but afterwards,

1103
01:03:53,197 --> 01:03:55,165
they like it
very much.

1104
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:56,867
Trust me, don't be afraid.

1105
01:03:56,901 --> 01:03:57,968
Afraid?

1106
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,703
Who is afraid?

1107
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:05,775
- Gianni, I have an idea.
- Yes?

1108
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:08,545
Let's go to the orchard.

1109
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,679
The orchard?

1110
01:04:09,713 --> 01:04:10,981
Now?

1111
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:12,983
- The orchard!
- Shh!

1112
01:04:13,017 --> 01:04:17,888
You want to leave a soft, warm
bed for a cold, hard orchard?

1113
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:20,424
Oh, yes, oh, please, Gianni.

1114
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:21,926
Please, love?

1115
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:24,461
I want our first night to be
under the stars,
under the moon,

1116
01:04:24,494 --> 01:04:26,563
on the soft grass.

1117
01:04:27,831 --> 01:04:30,500
You want to sleep
in the orchard?

1118
01:04:34,038 --> 01:04:36,306
Then that's what we'll do.

1119
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,508
Your shoes.

1120
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,283
Come on, crazy one, hurry up.

1121
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:48,518
Hurry up.

1122
01:05:34,231 --> 01:05:36,233
(ROOSTER CROWING)

1123
01:05:39,803 --> 01:05:41,338
NICOLINA: Gianni?

1124
01:05:41,371 --> 01:05:43,007
GIANNI: Hmm?

1125
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,176
NICOLINA: My hand
looks no different.

1126
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:47,911
GIANNI: Did you
think it would?

1127
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,180
NICOLINA: The trees
are no different.

1128
01:05:50,214 --> 01:05:50,814
The sun's no different.

1129
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,216
Nothing's different.

1130
01:05:52,249 --> 01:05:53,883
Only me.

1131
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:56,086
Oh, Gianni.

1132
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,988
I'll never be the same again.

1133
01:06:00,724 --> 01:06:03,827
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1134
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,671
And then finally the bride
and the bridegroom left.

1135
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:49,173
Oh, that bridegroom.

1136
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:52,509
With his eyes like
slowburning fires.

1137
01:06:52,542 --> 01:06:53,943
The girl's lucky.

1138
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:55,979
The boy is a prize.

1139
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,048
But eyes or no,
not only that...

1140
01:06:58,082 --> 01:06:59,349
(SMACKING PILLOW)

1141
01:06:59,383 --> 01:07:00,250
Ooh, Jessica!

1142
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:04,321
Do you have to be so noisy?

1143
01:07:04,354 --> 01:07:07,023
Oh, those feathers crashing
together inside there.

1144
01:07:10,294 --> 01:07:13,663
Anyway, you certainly had
the best of it last night,

1145
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,232
vino and amore.

1146
01:07:15,265 --> 01:07:17,534
Me, I only had vino.

1147
01:07:17,567 --> 01:07:20,804
But when I saw you walking out
with the marchese.

1148
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:21,405
You mean Giuseppe.

1149
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:24,841
Giuseppe?
Who is Giuseppe?

1150
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:25,742
He was the tallest,

1151
01:07:25,775 --> 01:07:29,679
the most handsome,
the one with the eyes,

1152
01:07:29,713 --> 01:07:32,082
and the cruel mouth

1153
01:07:32,116 --> 01:07:34,518
that isn't
cruel at all.

1154
01:07:35,552 --> 01:07:37,354
That's what I am saying.

1155
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:40,124
The one who led you
into the garden.

1156
01:07:40,157 --> 01:07:41,425
Him I saw, the marchese,

1157
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,827
Edmondo from
the chateau up there.

1158
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,329
Giuseppe is the marchese?

1159
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:49,266
There are girls
all over Sicily

1160
01:07:49,299 --> 01:07:51,335
who are looking for him.

1161
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:52,802
But not here.

1162
01:07:52,836 --> 01:07:55,705
Never with a girl
from here before.

1163
01:07:55,739 --> 01:07:58,342
But I suppose he broke
his rule for you

1164
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,111
because you are a stranger.

1165
01:08:01,145 --> 01:08:04,414
Mamma Parigi,
are you sure the man I...

1166
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:06,250
The man you saw me with last
night was...

1167
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:07,351
Was the marchese?

1168
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:09,486
Of course I'm sure.

1169
01:08:09,519 --> 01:08:12,622
When it comes to man,
at least I still got the eye.

1170
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:18,795
And speaking of men, there was
something going on last night.

1171
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:20,830
The husbands all drunk

1172
01:08:20,864 --> 01:08:23,867
and the wives
all happy.

1173
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,303
Mmm. Those women are
up to something...

1174
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,705
And it's against you,

1175
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:30,774
and it's
about to explode!

1176
01:08:32,876 --> 01:08:34,444
I can hardly wait.

1177
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:36,180
You won't have to.

1178
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:41,551
But why didn't you tell me it
was a strike, against me?

1179
01:08:41,585 --> 01:08:42,886
It would only have upset you.

1180
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:45,189
But why didn't you
stop them, Father?

1181
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:48,558
These women are fighting for
the most important things
in their lives.

1182
01:08:48,592 --> 01:08:50,260
Their husbands
and their homes.

1183
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:52,329
I couldn't stop them.

1184
01:08:52,362 --> 01:08:55,432
You think that
they're right to do
a thing like this to me?

1185
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:58,268
They are right to fight for
their homes, yes.

1186
01:08:58,302 --> 01:08:59,736
But why?

1187
01:08:59,769 --> 01:09:02,172
What wrong have I done?

1188
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:04,274
You are here, my child.

1189
01:09:04,308 --> 01:09:08,077
You are what we call
the occasion of sin.

1190
01:09:08,111 --> 01:09:12,048
The temptation
to the husbands,
the torment to their wives.

1191
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,750
No married man has touched me.

1192
01:09:13,783 --> 01:09:18,688
No, but you are in every man's
dream, and that is what their
wives can't forgive.

1193
01:09:20,357 --> 01:09:23,227
But what if
I want to stay, Father?

1194
01:09:23,260 --> 01:09:25,128
You are right to.

1195
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,331
Then what
do I do?

1196
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:30,166
That is something
no one can tell you.

1197
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,202
It is up to you.

1198
01:09:32,236 --> 01:09:33,970
Yes, of course.

1199
01:09:34,938 --> 01:09:36,005
Thank you, Father.

1200
01:09:37,874 --> 01:09:39,676
But why didn't you tell me it
was a strike?

1201
01:09:39,709 --> 01:09:40,910
What difference does it make?

1202
01:09:40,944 --> 01:09:42,779
You kept your promise,
didn't you?

1203
01:09:42,812 --> 01:09:43,947
Oh, yes, I did.

1204
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:44,848
Well, that's nice.

1205
01:09:44,881 --> 01:09:46,383
I hope you're not sorry.

1206
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:47,451
Of course not.

1207
01:09:47,484 --> 01:09:48,985
Good.

1208
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,087
You'd better take
that grass out of your hair.

1209
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:15,779
- Anything else?
- Oh, yes.

1210
01:10:15,812 --> 01:10:17,881
Some brown yarn.

1211
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:20,216
His socks are full of holes.

1212
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:21,485
Well, she begins early.

1213
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:23,052
But she looks tired.

1214
01:10:23,086 --> 01:10:24,754
Didn't you sleep well?

1215
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,824
Oh, yes, I slept beautifully,
but the night was short,

1216
01:10:27,857 --> 01:10:29,058
as you know.

1217
01:10:29,092 --> 01:10:30,994
As we all know.

1218
01:10:31,027 --> 01:10:33,997
I'll say.

1219
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,532
Oh, you should see him.

1220
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:39,403
I fail to see the humor.

1221
01:10:39,436 --> 01:10:41,371
As for you,
Signora Casablanca,

1222
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:43,773
have you any idea
what you have done?

1223
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:44,941
Oh, have I ever.

1224
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,644
Do you really think it's funny
that she has betrayed us?

1225
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,045
Sabotaged us?

1226
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:50,647
Humiliated us?

1227
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,981
Us, Virginia?

1228
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,717
Why not us?

1229
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,854
Well, I don't know about you,
but I haven't had to lock my
bedroom door lately.

1230
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,958
All right, go ahead and laugh.

1231
01:11:01,991 --> 01:11:03,727
But if it wasn't for me,

1232
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,296
some of you
would be crying by now.

1233
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:09,833
I was the one who first saw
the danger of this Jezebel,

1234
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:11,668
this American midwife,

1235
01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:14,971
and I was the first
to see her evil plan.

1236
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:18,241
I was the first one
to see that she was
going to use her

1237
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:21,845
devil-inspired body to steal
every man in this village.

1238
01:11:21,878 --> 01:11:23,046
Good morning, ladies.

1239
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:31,921
Father Antonio told me about
your strike,

1240
01:11:31,955 --> 01:11:34,524
and I was going to leave.

1241
01:11:34,558 --> 01:11:37,527
That was before
I heard you.

1242
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:40,063
My devil-inspired body.

1243
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:41,831
What quaint words
you use, Signorina,

1244
01:11:41,865 --> 01:11:43,933
for your dirty thoughts.

1245
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:46,169
As for stealing
your men,

1246
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:48,104
I'm innocent
and you know it.

1247
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,608
Still, you've tried to get rid
of me because

1248
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:53,176
you thought
I might be trouble.

1249
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:58,081
Well, ladies...

1250
01:11:58,114 --> 01:12:01,385
You don't know
what trouble is.

1251
01:12:05,722 --> 01:12:07,156
Such insolence.

1252
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,960
* Oh quelle belle Jessica

1253
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:13,897
* Oh quelle divine bambina

1254
01:12:13,930 --> 01:12:16,666
* In all the world
no replica

1255
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,503
* Of Jessica, of Jessica

1256
01:12:19,536 --> 01:12:22,506
* When Jessica
comes into town

1257
01:12:22,539 --> 01:12:25,008
* That little town
is turned around

1258
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:27,844
* And everything is
upside down

1259
01:12:27,877 --> 01:12:30,580
* With Jessica around

1260
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,650
* For Jessica
has laughing eyes

1261
01:12:33,683 --> 01:12:36,119
* Her tantalizing air

1262
01:12:36,152 --> 01:12:38,755
* For Jessica
has tender lips

1263
01:12:38,788 --> 01:12:41,525
* And honeycolored hair

1264
01:12:41,558 --> 01:12:43,326
* Oh

1265
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,095
* The baker cannot
bake his cake

1266
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,832
* The farmer
leans upon his rake

1267
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,535
* They're feeling
so romantica

1268
01:12:51,568 --> 01:12:54,438
* For Jessica, for Jessica

1269
01:12:54,471 --> 01:12:57,206
* Oh quelle belle Jessica

1270
01:12:57,240 --> 01:12:59,976
* Oh quelle divine bambina

1271
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:02,812
* They're feeling
so romantica

1272
01:13:02,846 --> 01:13:05,281
* Because of Jessica

1273
01:13:05,314 --> 01:13:08,017
* La bella Jessica

1274
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:10,687
* Che bella Jessica

1275
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:12,121
* Voila

1276
01:13:19,028 --> 01:13:20,664
* Eccola

1277
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:26,102
* Oh Lord

1278
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,872
* I must confess to it

1279
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,339
* I must have made

1280
01:13:30,373 --> 01:13:33,242
* A mess of it

1281
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:36,446
* Cannot be the fault of thee

1282
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,782
* So

1283
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:42,786
* It must be the fault of me

1284
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:46,656
* The ladies in the town
are right

1285
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:49,793
* The gentlemen
are downright right

1286
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:55,231
* And Jessica is also right

1287
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,834
* But everything
is wrong

1288
01:13:58,968 --> 01:14:01,605
* My little town

1289
01:14:01,638 --> 01:14:03,573
* Is turned around

1290
01:14:03,607 --> 01:14:06,543
* My quiet little town

1291
01:14:06,576 --> 01:14:08,545
* My little town

1292
01:14:08,578 --> 01:14:10,780
* Is upside down

1293
01:14:10,814 --> 01:14:14,784
* With Jessica around

1294
01:14:14,818 --> 01:14:16,653
* Ah

1295
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:20,389
* The ladies in the town
are right

1296
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:24,060
* The gentlemen
are downright right

1297
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:25,862
* And Jessica

1298
01:14:25,895 --> 01:14:28,131
* Is also right

1299
01:14:28,164 --> 01:14:30,934
* But everything is wrong

1300
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:35,471
* I cannot blame the men

1301
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:39,408
* I cannot blame the men

1302
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:41,511
* Amen.

1303
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:29,826
Oh, perfect.

1304
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:32,028
Perfect specimen.

1305
01:15:32,061 --> 01:15:35,431
Exquisite proportions.

1306
01:15:35,464 --> 01:15:36,933
The legs, perfect.

1307
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:40,003
The body, faintly mottled.

1308
01:15:45,508 --> 01:15:48,645
I waited long time for this.

1309
01:15:48,678 --> 01:15:50,580
Good afternoon, Jessica.

1310
01:15:50,614 --> 01:15:52,515
I've never seen anything
so perfect

1311
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,483
and I've seen quite a few.

1312
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:57,954
Now, wait a minute.

1313
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:01,424
You can't always tell the male
from the female, you know?

1314
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:05,294
But I didn't have the
slightest doubt this time.

1315
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:07,964
A real hairy old grandfather.

1316
01:16:07,997 --> 01:16:08,598
What?

1317
01:16:08,632 --> 01:16:09,532
TUFFI: A spider.

1318
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:10,466
Where?

1319
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,168
TUFFI: Oh, it's gone now.

1320
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:14,303
Are you interested in spiders?

1321
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,073
No.

1322
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:19,208
No, I'm not, but...

1323
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:20,610
I'm glad to hear you are.

1324
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:23,613
It's my life work.

1325
01:16:23,647 --> 01:16:25,248
I'm writing a book.

1326
01:16:25,281 --> 01:16:27,083
About spiders.

1327
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:31,220
Their qualities, their
patience, their cunning.

1328
01:16:31,254 --> 01:16:35,024
The infinite delicacy
of their handiwork.

1329
01:16:35,058 --> 01:16:37,326
Consider, madam, a web.

1330
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:38,862
A dangerous weapon

1331
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:42,531
of infinite beauty and grace.

1332
01:16:42,565 --> 01:16:45,234
Oh, I could spend
a whole life with them.

1333
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:07,423
He's coming.

1334
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:09,959
- Ladies.
- Luigi.

1335
01:17:09,993 --> 01:17:11,695
No, no, no, Nunzia,
I mustn't be disturbed.

1336
01:17:11,728 --> 01:17:13,162
I must be alone.

1337
01:17:13,196 --> 01:17:15,799
To encapture this
afternoon's experience.

1338
01:17:15,832 --> 01:17:17,466
It was unique.

1339
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:20,303
It was staggering.

1340
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:23,840
Well...

1341
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:32,148
Poor thing.

1342
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:33,182
Too bad.

1343
01:17:33,216 --> 01:17:34,984
The American girl?

1344
01:17:35,018 --> 01:17:36,252
Naked as a grape.

1345
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:37,320
(BOTH GASP)

1346
01:17:41,457 --> 01:17:43,192
A spider?

1347
01:17:43,226 --> 01:17:44,928
(LAUGHING)

1348
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:47,596
Oh, Luigi, Luigi.

1349
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,032
How sweet of you.

1350
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:53,102
And now, my love,
I have some news for you.

1351
01:17:53,136 --> 01:17:55,471
You are going to
be a father.

1352
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:58,041
What do you think of that?

1353
01:17:58,074 --> 01:18:00,043
- A... A father?
- Yes.

1354
01:18:00,076 --> 01:18:01,177
(MUMBLING)

1355
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:03,246
Luigi! Oh!

1356
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:05,381
Luigi! Luigi!

1357
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:15,658
Wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful!

1358
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,660
Bravo, Tuffi!

1359
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,864
Tuffi, you are a true
son of Sicily!

1360
01:18:20,897 --> 01:18:22,866
It was the first
shot that got the bird.

1361
01:18:22,899 --> 01:18:24,533
Bravo!
Bravo!

1362
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,273
No, you idiot!

1363
01:18:30,306 --> 01:18:31,908
You're in too deep!

1364
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,110
GIANNI: I'm planting them
in two inches.

1365
01:18:34,143 --> 01:18:35,845
- Hmm?
- GIANNI: The way you said.

1366
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:37,947
No, no, you're choking
them to death!

1367
01:18:37,981 --> 01:18:40,349
All right, all right.

1368
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,486
He's killing all my flowers.

1369
01:18:43,519 --> 01:18:45,688
Well, that's too bad.

1370
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:47,991
Now, you just stay down.

1371
01:18:48,024 --> 01:18:51,928
I keep telling him every day,
for four weeks,

1372
01:18:51,961 --> 01:18:54,663
he never listens.

1373
01:18:54,697 --> 01:18:56,933
He doesn't want to listen.

1374
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:58,802
He won't learn.

1375
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:01,137
You'll have to
help him again, huh?

1376
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,839
All right.

1377
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:05,741
You're the only
one who listens to me.

1378
01:19:05,775 --> 01:19:07,443
Nobody else does.

1379
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:08,711
Nothing does.

1380
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:10,613
My legs.

1381
01:19:10,646 --> 01:19:14,683
I tell them to get up,
they don't move.

1382
01:19:14,717 --> 01:19:16,285
How can they not move?

1383
01:19:17,987 --> 01:19:21,224
When I still have so much
living here to do.

1384
01:19:23,827 --> 01:19:26,495
You see how you
have weakened me, hmm?

1385
01:19:26,529 --> 01:19:27,363
With your soft ways?

1386
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:31,100
Why do you do it?
Why?

1387
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:34,470
Who else would put up with
your rotten disposition?

1388
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:37,306
I have the disposition
of a saint

1389
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,775
and God knows
I am more interesting.

1390
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:45,548
Now go on, go to that boy
before he kills my flowers.

1391
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:48,351
Go on, go on.

1392
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:49,819
I want to sleep.

1393
01:19:51,454 --> 01:19:53,990
Don't do me any favors,

1394
01:19:54,023 --> 01:19:57,894
but if tomorrow, you should
happen to be passing by...

1395
01:20:00,263 --> 01:20:02,098
I'll be passing by.

1396
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,666
(SIGHING)

1397
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:25,654
(WIND HOWLING)

1398
01:20:28,557 --> 01:20:30,593
- What do you think?
- Terrible.

1399
01:20:30,626 --> 01:20:33,396
It couldn't be worse if you
planned it that way,

1400
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:34,430
which you did, of course.

1401
01:20:34,463 --> 01:20:35,932
Did I?

1402
01:20:35,965 --> 01:20:37,333
Will you ride me
home on your Vespa?

1403
01:20:37,366 --> 01:20:38,401
No.

1404
01:20:38,434 --> 01:20:39,468
Why not?

1405
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:41,570
Because, everyone would see

1406
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:43,940
and that would
make it too serious.

1407
01:20:43,973 --> 01:20:45,041
Now, the way to plant.

1408
01:20:45,074 --> 01:20:48,144
Look at this, your
uncle and I have

1409
01:20:48,177 --> 01:20:50,046
both told you
time and again

1410
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:52,381
not the blue over there
but over there.

1411
01:20:52,415 --> 01:20:54,117
GIANNI: Then show me.

1412
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,252
JESSICA: The way to plant.

1413
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:57,553
Deep, but not too deep.

1414
01:20:57,586 --> 01:21:01,290
The rows
straight and neat.

1415
01:21:01,324 --> 01:21:03,292
Well, well, Gianni, so soon?

1416
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,163
I'm going away
for a week or two.

1417
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,666
If your uncle needs anything,
see that he gets it,

1418
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,002
and I'll take care
of it when I return.

1419
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:16,372
But don't tell him that,
he's a stubborn old fool.

1420
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:18,841
He should have gone to
the hospital weeks ago.

1421
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:20,143
- If he had...
- If he had,

1422
01:21:20,176 --> 01:21:22,045
he would
have died weeks ago.

1423
01:21:22,078 --> 01:21:23,746
Ah, you're an
authority on dying.

1424
01:21:23,779 --> 01:21:24,813
No.

1425
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:27,183
My best subject is fishing.

1426
01:21:27,216 --> 01:21:28,117
Really?

1427
01:21:28,151 --> 01:21:30,086
It shows how wrong
I can be.

1428
01:21:30,119 --> 01:21:31,720
I would have
thought you an amateur.

1429
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:33,022
I am.

1430
01:21:33,056 --> 01:21:34,390
But I learn quickly.

1431

I can't be sure that it will
work, Father.

that Edmondo could
save the situation

could save him.

01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:33,622
Well, now it's about time that
I decide whether or not

1609
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:35,558
you people
are good enough for me.

1610
01:31:36,592 --> 01:31:38,260
You want to know something?

1611
01:31:38,293 --> 01:31:39,695
You're not.

1612
01:31:39,728 --> 01:31:41,697
Beginning with you.

1613
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:06,254
(WIND HOWLING,
VEHICLE APPROACHING)

1614
01:32:10,258 --> 01:32:11,827
Jessica!

1615
01:32:19,067 --> 01:32:21,436
I thought Gianni
would be here.

1616
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:22,771
No.

1617
01:32:22,805 --> 01:32:24,940
He did not come home
so I thought...

1618
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:28,143
Was he with you?

1619
01:32:28,176 --> 01:32:29,277
No.

1620
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:32,014
Jessica...

1621
01:32:33,181 --> 01:32:35,150
Don't take him away from me.

1622
01:32:36,118 --> 01:32:38,453
You can if
you wanted to.

1623
01:32:38,486 --> 01:32:40,155
I don't know how to stop you.

1624
01:32:41,657 --> 01:32:43,191
But please don't.

1625
01:32:44,827 --> 01:32:47,529
What do you mean,
don't take him away?

1626
01:32:47,562 --> 01:32:49,131
I don't want him.

1627
01:32:49,164 --> 01:32:51,700
I don't want any of them.

1628
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:53,802
Aren't you women
ever going to understand

1629
01:32:53,836 --> 01:32:56,204
that I am not the one
to be afraid of?

1630
01:32:56,238 --> 01:32:57,973
It's yourselves.

1631
01:32:58,006 --> 01:33:01,576
And instead of being afraid,
you ought to be ashamed.

1632
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:05,213
How can you doubt
the men you love so easily?

1633
01:33:05,247 --> 01:33:06,348
Don't you trust them?

1634
01:33:09,051 --> 01:33:10,585
Oh, never mind.

1635
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:14,356
Nicolina, you don't have to
worry about Gianni.

1636
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:16,558
You never did have to.

1637
01:33:17,559 --> 01:33:19,094
Come on,
I'll take you home.

1638
01:33:21,664 --> 01:33:22,665
(KNOCKING)

1639
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:28,003
Jessica, my uncle is dying.

1640
01:33:28,036 --> 01:33:29,838
He wants you to come.

1641
01:33:29,872 --> 01:33:31,840
- Gianni.
- Nicolina.

1642
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:33,041
Let me come, too.

1643
01:33:50,392 --> 01:33:52,861
Where is she,
where is she, where is she?

1644
01:33:52,895 --> 01:33:55,030
I didn't hear you,
what was that?

1645
01:33:55,063 --> 01:33:57,499
I said, where the hell is she?

1646
01:33:57,532 --> 01:33:58,701
Lie still, lie still.

1647
01:33:58,734 --> 01:33:59,802
She will come.

1648
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:15,083
Is he in pain, Father?

1649
01:34:15,117 --> 01:34:16,318
No.

1650
01:34:16,351 --> 01:34:17,652
What do you know about it?
(SCOFFS)

1651
01:34:22,991 --> 01:34:24,960

think I'm dying.

1652

Don't push me!

1653
01:34:29,698 --> 01:34:32,434
They're in for a surprise.

1654
01:34:32,467 --> 01:34:34,669
Yes, yes, but I want you to
rest now.

1655
01:34:36,939 --> 01:34:40,008
I want to see my garden.

1656
01:34:40,042 --> 01:34:42,811
Later, but rest first.

1657
01:34:42,845 --> 01:34:44,813
I haven't time
for later.

1658
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:46,548
Help me, help me, lift me!

1659
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:53,155
What's wrong?

1660
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:58,026
My garden?

1661
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,127
Jessica?

1662
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:02,397
Yes. The storm.

1663
01:35:03,298 --> 01:35:04,867
I want to see it.

1664
01:35:05,968 --> 01:35:07,970
I want to see it.

1665
01:35:08,003 --> 01:35:09,504
Help me, help me...

The fruit
of 60 years.

1667
01:35:23,151 --> 01:35:26,121
My garden, all gone.

1668
01:35:26,154 --> 01:35:29,091
Well, I'll just
have to plant it again.

1669
01:35:35,864 --> 01:35:37,032
We'll do it for you.

1670
01:35:39,067 --> 01:35:40,068
Will you?

1671
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:44,706
Will you really, Jessica?

1672
01:35:45,874 --> 01:35:48,610
Exactly as you had it.

1673
01:35:48,643 --> 01:35:49,978
Flower by flower.

1674
01:35:50,012 --> 01:35:51,013
You'd better.

1675
01:35:51,046 --> 01:35:54,182
Don't forget,
I'll be up there watching.

1676
01:35:57,786 --> 01:36:00,222
Father, can you pray me
on up there, huh?

1677
01:36:00,255 --> 01:36:02,891
I'll do my best.

1678
01:36:02,925 --> 01:36:04,092
Well...

1679
01:36:04,126 --> 01:36:07,195
Maybe you ought
to get a head start.

1680
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:10,398
Edmondo.

1681
01:36:10,432 --> 01:36:11,433
Yes?

1682
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,538
Am I...
Am I really dying?

1683
01:36:19,174 --> 01:36:20,242
Tell me the truth.

1684
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,711
Yes, you are.

1685
01:36:23,745 --> 01:36:25,280
Exactly.

1686
01:36:26,014 --> 01:36:28,083
And half dead as I am,

1687
01:36:28,116 --> 01:36:31,053
I am more alive
than you.

1688
01:36:31,086 --> 01:36:32,287
Wake up, boy.

1689
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:33,355
Wake up.

1690
01:36:37,059 --> 01:36:38,126
Jessica?

1691
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:42,297
I'm right here, Crupi.

1692
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:44,399
Lie still.

1693
01:36:44,432 --> 01:36:45,500
Don't talk.

1694
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:46,835
What do you mean,
don't talk?

1695
01:36:48,904 --> 01:36:51,106
You know nothing
stops me from talking!

1699
01:38:12,187 --> 01:38:15,823
No, we're sorry,
but we're off to Rome
to forget it all.

1700
01:38:15,857 --> 01:38:20,262
It's nice of Maria Lombardo
and the others
to send their apologies,

1701
01:38:20,295 --> 01:38:23,765
but we've been hurt in our
feelings in a terrible way.

1702
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,269
Tighter with that buckle,
don't you think, Father?

1703
01:38:28,336 --> 01:38:30,472
Ah, good for you.

1704
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:32,374
Finished with
the trunk, Jessica?

1705
01:38:32,407 --> 01:38:35,277
Then let Father Antonio
close it for you.

1706
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:41,349
Jessica, isn't there
anything I can say?

1707
01:38:41,383 --> 01:38:45,287
Jessica, we are not forgetting
our poor dead husband's
picture, are we?

1708
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:46,588
Excuse me, Father.

1709
01:38:46,621 --> 01:38:47,622
Did you
say something?

1710
01:38:47,655 --> 01:38:48,923
Did I interrupt you, huh?

1711
01:38:48,957 --> 01:38:50,058
Hmm?

1712
01:38:56,264 --> 01:38:58,133
- Don't go to Rome.
- MAMMA: Why not?

1713
01:38:58,166 --> 01:38:59,601
Why shouldn't we go?

1714
01:39:00,868 --> 01:39:03,138
Listen to me, Jessica.

1715
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:05,540
I made a bad mistake.

1716
01:39:05,573 --> 01:39:07,809
I was the one who asked
Edmondo to put you out.

1717
01:39:09,944 --> 01:39:12,614
I just wanted you two to be
together again because...

1718
01:39:12,647 --> 01:39:13,848
Because I was sure.

1719
01:39:13,881 --> 01:39:19,387
That is,
I felt that he is...

1720
01:39:21,089 --> 01:39:23,158
I hoped, but I was wrong.

1721
01:39:23,191 --> 01:39:26,661
It takes a big man to admit it
when he is wrong, Father,

1722
01:39:26,694 --> 01:39:28,730
and we forgive you.

1723
01:39:28,763 --> 01:39:31,266
Shall we lock the trunk now
so we can go, Jessica?

1724
01:39:33,935 --> 01:39:35,070
Won't you stay?

1725
01:39:36,138 --> 01:39:37,339
Because of me?

1726
01:39:37,372 --> 01:39:40,442
Oh, Father, of course not.

1727
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:41,809
The women?

1728
01:39:41,843 --> 01:39:44,312
Not the women.

1729
01:39:44,346 --> 01:39:46,414
Then who?

1730
01:39:46,448 --> 01:39:48,916
Oh...

1731
01:39:48,950 --> 01:39:49,884
I don't know.

1732
01:39:51,053 --> 01:39:52,754
I think I know.

1733
01:39:52,787 --> 01:39:54,256
It's the marchese.

1734
01:39:54,289 --> 01:39:55,090
I was just going to say that.

1735
01:39:55,123 --> 01:39:57,225
- It's the marchese!
- What?

1736
01:39:57,259 --> 01:39:59,094
Oh.

1737
01:40:01,796 --> 01:40:03,498
I was afraid you had gone.

1738
01:40:03,531 --> 01:40:05,367
We were just leaving.
Come, Jessica.

1739
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:06,668
Wait, please.

1740
01:40:08,536 --> 01:40:11,273
I'm sorry to break in
this way.

1741
01:40:11,306 --> 01:40:12,440
I'm sorry about many things.

1742
01:40:15,477 --> 01:40:18,413
But, well, the way you feel
about babies

1743
01:40:18,446 --> 01:40:20,815
is how I feel
about promises.

1744
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,984
I like to see them
taken care of.

1745
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:26,188
What kind of promises did you
have in mind, marchese?

1746
01:40:26,221 --> 01:40:27,489
- Come, Mamma Parigi.
- Hmm?

1747
01:40:27,522 --> 01:40:29,491
- Out.
- Out, why?

1748
01:40:29,524 --> 01:40:30,625
Oh...

1749
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:46,141
You promised to help restore
my old friend's garden.

1750
01:40:48,443 --> 01:40:50,645
What are you
going to do about it?

1751
01:40:50,678 --> 01:40:52,046
JESSICA: I have never...

1752
01:40:58,120 --> 01:41:00,422
EDMONDO: Are you going to
keep your promise?

1753
01:41:00,455 --> 01:41:02,624
JESSICA: Yes, I suppose
I have to.

1754
01:41:02,657 --> 01:41:05,260
EDMONDO: But Jessica,
it must be done my way.

1755
01:41:05,293 --> 01:41:10,132
The way and Crupi had the
colors mixed together,
it looked like a jungle!

1756
01:41:10,165 --> 01:41:12,867
JESSICA: Well, that's the way
we wanted it to look!

1757
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:14,369
And I think a jungle

1758
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:16,404
is the most beautiful
garden of all...

is ripe,

01:43:36,844 --> 01:43:40,382
an unusually dry beginning,

1786
01:43:40,415 --> 01:43:43,485
thou has showered us
with the rain

1787
01:43:43,518 --> 01:43:47,088
and sunshine of thy mercy.

1788
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:50,692
Our once-barren fields

1789
01:43:50,725 --> 01:43:54,128
are now teeming
with abundance,

1790
01:43:54,161 --> 01:43:57,299
thanks to thy infinite wisdom,

1791
01:43:57,332 --> 01:44:01,102
and we ask thee
to continue to keep

1792
01:44:01,135 --> 01:44:04,472
thy fatherly eye upon us

1793
01:44:04,506 --> 01:44:06,741
as we
prepare to gather

1794
01:44:06,774 --> 01:44:09,176
this great harvest,

1795
01:44:09,210 --> 01:44:12,547
for without
thy help,

1796
01:44:12,580 --> 01:44:15,550
we can go wrong, Father.

1797
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:18,252
Oh, how we
can go wrong

1798
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:24,459
* Oh quelle belle Jessica

1799
01:44:24,492 --> 01:44:27,562
* Oh quelle divine bambina

1800
01:44:27,595 --> 01:44:30,164
* In all the world
no replica

1801
01:44:30,197 --> 01:44:33,134
* Of Jessica, of Jessica

1802
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:35,970
* When Jessica
comes into town

1803
01:44:36,003 --> 01:44:38,673
* That little town
is turned around

1804
01:44:38,706 --> 01:44:41,242
* And everything is
upside down

1805
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:44,111
* With Jessica around

1806
01:44:44,145 --> 01:44:46,948
* Oh quelle belle Jessica

1807
01:44:46,981 --> 01:44:51,285
* Oh quelle divine bambina

1808
01:44:51,319 --> 01:44:54,756
* In all the world
no replica

1809
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:59,327
* Of bella Jessica
