1
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,960
This view's gonna be amazing.

2
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,320
- I have a surprise for you.
- What's that?

3
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,760
Close your eyes.

4
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,160
Open them.

5
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,080
Will you marry...

6
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Yes.

7
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,520
Where did you go?

8
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,360
This isn't funny, Todd.

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Where are you?

10
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,320
Where are you?

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,440
Help! Anyone! Can you help?

12
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,640
Please, help me!

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
Please. Todd.

14
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,120
All right. That's the last one.

15
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,800
Please tell me the mooring's intact.

16
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,040
{\an5}Looks fine. The earthquake
didn't cause any visible cracks.

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,760
All right. Great.
I get to stay above water today.

18
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,720
Another chance for me
to teach your uncle how it's done.

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Whatever.

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Hey, Ray, if you're not getting
any bites, let's pull it in.

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,840
Never want to
stay in the same spot too long.

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,240
Hey, man.

23
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,560
What if this is the spot, Hunter?

24
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
Come on. Slow and steady.

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,880
That's the McCray way.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,600
Maybe too slow and too steady
is the reason...

27
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,080
why you still haven't caught
the big one, Uncle Ray.

28
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,320
Yeah, Ray, what about that big one?

29
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,600
Hey, keep on.
I'm gonna show both of y'all.

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Just keep on.

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,520
We're gonna miss you.
Are you sure you won't reconsider?

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,880
Look around, Hunter.

33
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,120
This?

34
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,840
This is heaven, baby.

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,480
{\an5}You ain't gonna find
anything better than this.

36
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,760
{\an5}I'm not gonna pretend
I haven't become fond of this place.

37
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,440
And us?

38
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,880
That's not the issue.

39
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,880
What do they think they're doing?

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,640
Besides working my last nerve?

41
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,600
I think they breaking
every maritime law there is.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,520
That's why some people
should stay on the shore.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,040
Yeah, they got fools
over there too, Hunter.

44
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,080
That, my friend,
is why I live on a boat.

45
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,960
I smell a teachable moment coming.

46
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,240
Me too.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,360
(Foreign Language)

48
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,720
Come on. Move the clown car
over here. Move it.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,760
Who the hell are you?

50
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Adult supervision.

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Thanks, pops. You know,
I think we got it from here, though.

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,120
From here, I don't see one person...

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,840
that could pass
a field sobriety test.

54
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,120
Harbor master, boy.

55
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,000
Hand over them fireworks.

56
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,600
Do you have any idea
how much I spent on these?

57
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,120
Not as much as you're gonna have to
pay the tourist police...

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,280
if I turn you in.

59
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Whatever.

60
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Have fun.

61
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,120
I took this off him.

62
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
Get your boat fixed.

63
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
See? He's cool.

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,720
Cheers to Mr. Tik.

65
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,080
(Foreign Language)

66
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,240
You see the look on the kid's face
when you took his fireworks?

67
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,680
Priceless.

68
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,800
You better grab that pole, Ray,
before it's gone.

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,360
Oh shit. Come on.

70
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,920
I got it. It's the big one!

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,440
- I got it. I got it this time.
- Come on.

72
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,240
- Almost.
- Easy.

73
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,680
- Come on.
- Here's a big one. I got it!

74
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
What's that?

75
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,840
Fires? Dead bodies?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm gonna have to start
taking my blood pressure medicine...

77
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
- before I leave the dock.
- He's been in the water a long time.

78
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,120
You guys need to look at this.

79
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,840
Maybe that's where
the body came from.

80
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,760
That's not good.
I'm gonna call the authorities.

81
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Let's head in.

82
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,120
I'm gonna pull the drone.

83
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,520
I'ma cover his ugly ass up.

84
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
Could this be an algae bloom?

85
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,320
Yeah, maybe
if we were in the Caribbean.

86
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,760
Not in these waters, though.

87
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Uncle Ray?

88
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,040
Get off my niece!
Hell is wrong with you, man?

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,760
Look, stay right there where you at.

90
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,960
Look, you don't want
none of this, man.

91
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,440
I don't know who you are
or what you are...

92
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
but you better
stay the hell away from me.

93
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,360
I don't know about you.
You want some of this?

94
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
- You want some of this?
- I'm scared.

95
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,360
Get back. Come on. Hunter!

96
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,960
- Stay right here.
- Please.

97
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh stop, man. Look, I said stop!

98
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,080
You know what "halt" means?

99
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,880
Bitch, you better move.
I'm not playing with you.

100
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,840
Ray, take care of Jada. I got this.

101
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Look, buddy. I don't know
what you've been through...

102
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,360
but unless you back off,
this is gonna go through you next.

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,240
Jada! No. Baby, please.

104
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,720
- I'm scared.
- It's okay.

105
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,880
Stay right here.
Stay with me, baby. Stay.

106
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,440
- Is she all right?
- Is it dead?

107
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,600
- Is it gone?
- Did you kill it?

108
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,880
- I think so.
- Good.

109
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Hunter!

110
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,080
You've got to be kidding me.

111
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,800
It's just a meth head, right?

112
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Some old punk washed up
on the side of the pier.

113
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
I don't know, Ray,
why don't you show him your badge?

114
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,840
Maybe that'll stop him.

115
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,600
Formalities ended
when he bit my niece!

116
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,800
Got to be
a rational explanation, right?

117
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,960
Well, if you got one, I'm all ears.

118
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,880
Buh-bye.

119
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,920
You want some more of this?
You better not come back over here.

120
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Ray?

121
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
Oh shit.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Jada.

123
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,920
It's okay.

124
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Are we dreaming?

125
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,600
No. I wish we were.

126
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,000
I got this, man. Go radio for help...

127
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
- please.
- I'm on it.

128
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,240
Stay with me.

129
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,480
So this makes, what,
five double shifts in a row now?

130
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,640
Six, if you're counting.

131
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,360
Mom, when's the last time
you had a date?

132
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,160
Look, she's hot, right, Taani?

133
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,320
Smokin'.

134
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,960
You're sweet. What I do
is more important than how I look.

135
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,640
But you just need
to find some balance.

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,040
Dad's been gone a long time.
He'd want you to be happy.

137
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,120
I am happy.

138
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,680
Now that's more like it.

139
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,880
Hello?

140
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,480
I've got
an accident on my hands here.

141
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,200
Let me guess.
Another charter client...

142
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,200
cast his line
into his buddy's tackle box?

143
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,400
No, but I owe you dinner for that.

144
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,800
And a bottle of wine.
The trauma still lingers.

145
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,080
It's a different kind of accident.

146
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,640
It's Ray's niece.
She's hurt pretty bad.

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,880
Oh yeah. I'm on my way.

148
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
Duty calls.

149
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,920
More like booty calls.

150
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,800
What'd he say?

151
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,440
- Enough.
- Look, all I'm saying is...

152
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,920
what's the point
of living in paradise...

153
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,480
without someone to share it with?

154
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,240
When I get home, you better be there,
walls still standing.

155
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,440
Promise. I love you.

156
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,640
I'll take care of her, Mrs. Wright.

157
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,400
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.

158
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Bye.

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,440
Come on. Give me your arm.

160
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,760
I got you. Wasn't nothing normal
about that back there, Hunter.

161
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,760
I mean, nothing we did
was even able to stop him.

162
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
How do we know
there's no more out there...

163
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,960
looking for
another midday snack, huh?

164
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Hey, Ray, reel it in.

165
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,600
- You're gonna be okay.
- Okay. Hey, guys.

166
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Hey, Doc.

167
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,840
Hey, Jada?

168
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,360
- What happened?
- Curved laceration.

169
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,920
Tissue loss.

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,280
This is a bite wound. What happened?

171
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,160
Look, we pulled this dead guy in
off the water, right?

172
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,640
We laid him down and then...

173
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,880
His teeth...
he started biting everybody...

174
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,960
and then Hunter grabbed a machete...

175
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
- and he went...
- Hey.

176
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,320
This guy regains consciousness...

177
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,360
he starts biting
and attacking everybody...

178
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,080
and then we throw him overboard.

179
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,280
It's okay, Jada.

180
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,440
- You're okay, honey.
- Okay. Coming through.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,720
So are you gonna be leaving?

182
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Yeah, tomorrow's my last day
in Emrys Bay.

183
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,200
No good-byes? You owe me dinner.

184
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
- You'll be okay.
- Are you coming or not?

185
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,240
I'm gonna talk to Sheriff Akoni...

186
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,880
see if we can figure out
what's going on out there.

187
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,240
Truck's in the lot.

188
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
Meet us at the hospital later?

189
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Got it.

190
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,080
Hey.

191
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,480
- Thanks for getting here so quick.
- No problem.

192
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,080
She's really gonna be okay, right?

193
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,640
She's gonna be fine.

194
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,440
This is Akoni. I'm at the pier.

195
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,120
The water looks calm.
It's all fine here.

196
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,480
<i>- Head out to Comet's Beach next.</i>
- Copy that.

197
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,880
Thought you'd be long gone, Shaw.

198
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,920
Yeah, sometimes the heart and head
aren't always in sync.

199
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,720
Is there a reason why you're
walking around with a machete?

200
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,080
If you saw what I saw,
you'd want one in both hands.

201
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,560
Yeah, Ray called in.
Some kind of sea monster?

202
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,440
A lunatic attacked his niece.

203
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,280
Beach squatter?
Boating accident? What?

204
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,080
I've been working on the water
for 30 years.

205
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,520
I have never, ever, seen
anything like this.

206
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,840
I don't have the time to
go on a wild goose chase with you.

207
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,760
What's going on out there
is a bigger problem.

208
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
You see that, right?

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,120
- Okay.
- Come on. Take a ride with me.

210
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,920
<i>You hear the sounds
that come in waves</i>

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,400
The singer's name is Dag.

212
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,000
Or maybe you're into the drummer.
His name is Ivan. He's Russian!

213
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,640
Interested?

214
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,240
Ask me again
when I can hear myself think.

215
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,040
<i>Yeah, party!</i>

216
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,320
- Chemical spill?
- Maybe.

217
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
That's the only thing
I could think of...

218
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
that may explain
that guy we saw on the boat today.

219
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
Where's the body?

220
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,480
I don't know. This is
where we threw it overboard, though.

221
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,640
We need to see where the source is
coming from.

222
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
I got eyes for you.

223
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,360
Rand, you're so cool.

224
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,120
- That was incredible.
- I know.

225
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,640
So you like our set?

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,640
Yeah. You guys were...

227
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,760
Not your kind of thing, huh?

228
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
No, we had fun.

229
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,880
Just doesn't really seem like you.

230
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,680
Thank you.

231
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,240
Rand's taste is
more "mallet to the head."

232
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,720
Me?

233
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,840
All I want is fans who like our music
because it comes from the heart...

234
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,240
not because it's loud.

235
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
I'm Dag.

236
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Sam.

237
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,720
I think the earthquake
may have something to do with this.

238
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,560
We didn't go this deep last time.

239
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,800
Is that a documented wreck?

240
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,440
Not that I'm aware of.

241
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,240
Ship's name and designation
have been removed.

242
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,920
No telling where it's from then.

243
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,800
No, this is an Anton 350
made by Anders Marine in Denmark.

244
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,680
Very few were ever made
with this extended 80-foot hull.

245
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,840
Whatever took it down
took down a very rare ship.

246
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
How do you know that?

247
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,880
Grew up in San Pedro,
right off the docks.

248
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,240
Some people know cars.
I know boats.

249
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,280
There's the light source.

250
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,160
Did you see that?

251
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Yeah...

252
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I put a machete into
the chest of one of these guys today.

253
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,680
It didn't stop him,
didn't slow him down one bit.

254
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Come on, Shaw.

255
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,760
- Tell you what I think they are.
- What's that?

256
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,680
It's alive, but dead.

257
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
Let's stick to reality.

258
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,560
These are zombies.

259
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,080
You got me, Shaw. You got me.

260
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Don't even say it.

261
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,720
Get us out of here.

262
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,280
Pok, there's been
some kind of outbreak offshore.

263
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,840
Evac is mandatory.

264
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,760
Get everyone off the beach now,
and find my daughter.

265
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,960
<i>Attention: by order
of the Emrys Bay Police...</i>

266
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,360
<i>the beach is closed.</i>

267
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,560
This is a mandatory evacuation
until further notice.

268
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,720
This is not a drill.

269
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,680
- Hey.
<i>- Hey, Doc.</i>

270
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,920
Akoni and I think
there's been some kind of outbreak...

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,320
so isolate Jada,
keep your eyes open...

272
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,920
for anyone else
who comes in with similar injuries.

273
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,400
Okay. What are we talking about here?

274
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,400
- Danny, check this out.
<i>- Clear the beach.</i>

275
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,760
Seek shelter.

276
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,800
- Could you...
- Okay.

277
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
It should be over there.

278
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,960
That's not a sound I like to hear.

279
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,240
Look, Sam's at my house
with Akoni's daughter.

280
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,240
If anything happens,
can you get to them?

281
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,840
Got it, but the tsunami's
only part of the problem.

282
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,120
<i>There's been some kind of outbreak.</i>

283
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,840
I've got to start prepping patients
for evac. You be safe.

284
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,440
Wait!

285
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,640
What are we gonna do
about those things?

286
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,000
What are you gonna do about that?

287
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,200
Oh my gosh, a tsunami.

288
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,960
That's totally insane.

289
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,120
Your mom's gonna have a busy shift.

290
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,240
Your dad too.

291
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,560
So I guess we're not getting tacos.

292
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,960
Where do you think you're going?
We need to get behind the wave.

293
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,480
I've seen those things.
I know what they're capable of.

294
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
When the wave hits the beach...

295
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,040
flooding's gonna be
the least of our problems.

296
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
People are gonna need our help.

297
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,080
How are we gonna do that
without getting ourselves killed?

298
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,080
We're gonna
ride the barrel of the wave.

299
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,400
When we get to the beach,
we'll storm it.

300
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
We'll help everybody that we can.

301
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,800
- You know you're crazy, right?
- Hang on.

302
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,520
It's a zombie tsunami.

303
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,360
Come on. They're moving past us.

304
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Run!

305
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,040
Save your bullets.

306
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Blaine?

307
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,080
Blaine, honey, are you okay?

308
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,240
Shaun didn't make it.

309
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,720
But we did, baby.

310
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,560
That's all that matters.

311
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
Hey!

312
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,760
What'd I say?

313
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,880
Baby!

314
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,480
Hey, look, if there was ever a time
to celebrate, this is it.

315
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,720
Okay, so we'll only
keep you two isolated...

316
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,400
until we know everything's okay.

317
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,720
Great. It keeps
getting better and better.

318
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,640
It's just a precaution
until we can determine...

319
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,800
what this outbreak is.

320
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,400
What I saw out there...

321
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,600
it's gonna take more than this
to kill them.

322
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,280
Dr. Wright, we need you outside.

323
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,800
Okay. Hang in there.

324
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,120
I'll check in soon,
but I got to get back.

325
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,640
This evacuation's reduced us
to a skeleton staff.

326
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,040
I'm trying. No!

327
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,240
- Over here!
- Come on...

328
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,880
they're not breathing! What's wrong?

329
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,120
- You took one of them on?
- Yeah, Ray and I.

330
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
It was a lot easier
when we could throw them overboard.

331
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,360
Hey, get away from them!
Get off the beach!

332
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,360
They're hurt. They need help.

333
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,840
Come on!

334
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,680
You see what I'm talking about here?

335
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,160
Zombies it is.

336
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,640
I still can't get a hold of my mom
or anybody.

337
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,520
- What about your dad?
- No, nothing yet.

338
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,160
What's wrong with their faces?

339
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Tsunami must have messed them up.

340
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,640
What if those things get up here?

341
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,560
We've got to
get away from this place.

342
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,920
- Come on.
- Yeah.

343
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
Come on, this way. Let's go.

344
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,560
I'll take care of that one.

345
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,960
- Watch out.
- Get out of here.

346
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,640
Out of my way.

347
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,600
- Get out.
- Run, come on!

348
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Run!

349
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,320
Let's get out of here. Thank you!

350
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Uncle Ray.

351
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,520
Hey, baby.

352
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,360
I'm so cold.

353
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,840
It's gonna be okay.
Let me get you some cover.

354
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,480
So hungry, I just...

355
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,800
That's... Let me get the nurse
to bring you something to eat, okay?

356
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Jada?

357
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,640
Jada?

358
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Jada!

359
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,560
Hey, stay with me.
Jada, stay with me.

360
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,720
No. Jada. Jada, what are you doing?

361
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:17,240
Hey, stop! Hey! Jada, stop!

362
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:21,200
Hey! Jada, don't! Jada, stop!
What you doing?

363
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,160
Jada, get off him! Stop doing that!

364
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
No! Hey, help! Help!

365
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Beach is overrun.

366
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,680
We've got to set up a triage
for the victims.

367
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Maybe not.

368
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,080
Let's get back to the station,
regroup, and call for backup.

369
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Ray's truck.

370
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,120
They're everywhere!

371
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,960
- Stop! Don't shoot.
- Man, we're not one of them.

372
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,280
You again.

373
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Yeah, of course.

374
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,880
I see you got a new sidekick.

375
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm sorry. He's an idiot.
Can you please help us?

376
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Where'd you two come from?

377
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,720
We were at the beach.
It was awful, and we lost Shaun.

378
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,640
Could you just, like, get us
to our hotel or something?

379
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,880
Five-star hotel's not gonna
protect you from that.

380
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,880
What's that even supposed to mean?

381
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,640
That it's not a problem
you can buy your way out of.

382
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,960
So buckle up, sweetheart.

383
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,680
They're coming.

384
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,560
4, 5, 0, 8.

385
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,080
Hello?

386
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Hello?

387
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,960
Someone, help!

388
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Somebody!

389
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,080
No!

390
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,360
Oh my God.
Have you seen what's out there?

391
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,440
Yeah.

392
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,560
If the contagion's aerosol,
you could contract it from breathing.

393
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,960
Unless you plan
on tying their mouths shut...

394
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,160
- this is not gonna get it.
- They're infected.

395
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,520
- Clearly, it's a contagion.
- Look, it's more than that!

396
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,240
They rode in here
on that big-ass wave...

397
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,600
bringing a double dose of disaster
to this town like nobody's seen...

398
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,280
so I suggest you lace up
your running shoes, Doc...

399
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,120
because if what's out there
bites you, it's game over.

400
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,840
How is this happening?

401
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,760
How? Why?

402
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,920
I stopped caring about that...

403
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,440
when I saw my niece
bite the head off of that orderly.

404
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,080
Do you know what that sounds like?

405
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,640
Do you know what that looks like?

406
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,320
Move right to acceptance, Doc...

407
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,320
'cause denial is a death sentence.

408
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,600
I can't reach any other units
on comms.

409
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,920
Has anyone reported in?

410
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,920
- No one.
- What are we dealing with here, sir?

411
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,920
Welcome to Crazy Town, Officer Pok.

412
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
Come on!

413
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Blaine, come on.

414
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Come on!

415
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Hurry up! Come on!

416
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,200
- Sorry.
- Blaine!

417
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,640
Give me the chair!

418
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Get me the other one.

419
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
Come on, Doc.

420
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,080
We can't stop them all
with just these.

421
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,160
I know.

422
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,680
Okay. We cut through the terrace.

423
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,240
The admin offices
are right next door.

424
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,280
Terrace it is.

425
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,680
How could you do that?

426
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,760
Man, it's everybody for themselves!

427
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,840
She saved your ass.

428
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,840
What would you expect me to do, man?

429
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,680
Let them bite me?

430
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
No way.

431
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,960
I'm gonna do everything it takes
to survive.

432
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,680
Including this.

433
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
Lower your weapon.

434
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,880
Lower your weapon!

435
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,680
Put it down.

436
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,960
You got some balls, kid.

437
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,880
- I got bullets too.
- Take it easy.

438
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,080
I want those big guns in there.

439
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,560
That's not gonna happen.

440
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,480
Give me the keys now!

441
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,120
Open the door!
Give me the keys! Open the door.

442
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,280
Give me the keys now. Now!

443
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,960
Stay with me, Pok. Stay with me.

444
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,960
This kid's worse
than the things outside.

445
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,360
Rand!

446
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,800
How's that for "pay to play"?

447
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,160
Let's go!

448
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,720
Come on. This way.

449
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,600
Come on! Oh no!

450
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
No!

451
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,960
Hey, wait.

452
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,200
Check out here. Go.

453
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,480
Come on.

454
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,520
I think I sprained my ankle.

455
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,360
Okay, duck.

456
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,640
- Oh my God!
- Taani!

457
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,760
Help!

458
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,600
Taani!

459
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,800
Come on, Ta...

460
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,960
Taani, look out!

461
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,960
Get away from them!

462
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,280
Go! We'll find you!

463
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,520
Okay.

464
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,760
This is Emrys Bay station
issuing an open-channel mayday.

465
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,320
In addition to tsunami damage...

466
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,120
we've had an outbreak
of unknown origin. Over.

467
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,720
To all naval assets
in the vicinity...

468
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:54,000
this is Emrys Bay station
issuing an open-channel mayday.

469
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,120
Tell me again
why I didn't shoot that kid dead.

470
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,040
That thing hanging around your neck.

471
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,120
Fair enough.

472
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,920
So I logged into
the maritime registry...

473
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
using Ray's account...

474
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,480
There's only one Anton 350
in the regional archives...

475
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,080
and it's registered
to Revok Industries...

476
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,960
from 1981 to 1985...

477
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,400
but then it was decommissioned.

478
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,360
Status now is salvaged, junked.

479
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,080
Then what's it doing
at the bottom of the ocean?

480
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,600
Exactly. Something doesn't add up.

481
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,240
I think
we've got more pressing issues.

482
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,640
The key to all this is this ship.

483
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,040
If we can find one person
that knows something about it...

484
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,360
maybe we can get some answers.

485
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,840
It's not safe here. We've got to go.

486
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,360
We're gonna need some more firepower.

487
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,000
Okay, we cross over
to the main building.

488
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,120
We cut through Radiology.

489
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Okay.

490
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,600
Oh, hell no!

491
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Bite me.

492
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,480
Jada, don't you have
something else to do?

493
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,080
Oh my God.
Whatever that is, it's not Jada.

494
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,160
Yeah, I know.

495
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,680
Still not gonna be an easy call
to my sister Gina, though.

496
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,600
We pulled enough hardware
off drug boats and narco planes...

497
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,680
over the years
to outfit a small army.

498
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,280
Wow.

499
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,440
Did you get this off a drug dealer?

500
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,560
Some kid bought it online
with his mom's credit card.

501
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,200
Went all shogun
on his brother's bedroom.

502
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
What happened to his brother?

503
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,560
Still looking for his pinky toe.

504
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,280
When we're done with them,
we're gonna find my daughter.

505
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,440
Hey!

506
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,640
Dude, are you serious right now?

507
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,640
Seriously, you guys can't
just leave me like this.

508
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,120
Let's go kill some dead guys.

509
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,080
Hey, this is murder! Hey!

510
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,160
I can't hold them off any longer.

511
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,000
Do it now!

512
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,640
Nice shot.

513
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,840
They're still squirming.

514
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,960
I'll take squirming over biting
any day.

515
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,120
Reinforcements.

516
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,920
'Cause one would have been too easy.

517
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Come on.

518
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
You shoot a zombie in the head,
they're supposed to die, right?

519
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,520
Maybe there's something more.

520
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,320
That's what I'm afraid of.

521
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,600
Look. Dead ahead.

522
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,840
They're getting on my nerves.
Hold on.

523
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,880
Roadkill.

524
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,240
Come on.

525
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Don't look back. Come on.

526
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Come on, be quick. Come on.

527
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,200
Wake up! Come on,
open the door! Wake up!

528
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,960
- Come on! They're trying to kill us!
- What's going on, man?

529
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,240
- What's wrong with them?
- What are you doing?

530
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,520
Get back in here, Ivan.

531
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,800
Rock and roll, baby!

532
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,080
Come on! We gotta go!

533
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,560
We got to go now!

534
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
Car's dead.

535
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,640
What are we gonna do?

536
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,760
We'll figure this out.

537
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,360
They're everywhere.

538
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
Come on!

539
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,440
Hello?

540
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Hello?

541
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,400
This is private property.

542
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,240
The gate's there for a reason,
so just go away.

543
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,000
No. I need your help, please.
They're after me.

544
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,800
Turn around. I need to check you out.

545
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,000
Look, perv, just open the door!

546
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,120
<i>Have you been bitten?</i>

547
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,200
What?

548
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,120
<i>Look. Look at me.
Do I look like I have been bitten?</i>

549
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,960
Show me the back of your head.

550
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,240
Oh my God! Fine.

551
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,880
If you don't open the door now,
I am gonna be bit.

552
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,520
Are we all good?

553
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,720
Hello?

554
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
Yeah, okay.

555
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,320
You live here by yourself?

556
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,280
- Yeah.
- That explains the Unabomber chic.

557
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:30,880
Can you please put that away?

558
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,960
You first.

559
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,840
Okay.

560
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:37,000
I've been watching from up here.

561
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Looks really bad.

562
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,000
I have monitors all around town.
When these things arrived...

563
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,040
just about everyone was infected
in less than an hour.

564
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,520
There are so many of them.

565
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,400
I need to call my dad.

566
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,840
Can I use that?

567
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
Please?

568
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,360
Thank you.

569
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,960
<i>Dad, do you copy?</i>

570
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,360
Taani, where are you? You're okay?

571
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,560
<i>You don't know
how glad I am to hear your voice.</i>

572
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:05,960
Yeah.

573
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,320
I'm safe.

574
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,960
I'm...

575
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,120
I'm at the compound
on top of the hillside.

576
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,240
At Driscoll's?

577
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,080
I told you never
to go near that place. He's crazy.

578
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,160
Yeah.

579
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,400
Great. Dad,
I didn't really have a choice, 'kay?

580
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,320
His place is pretty fortified.
Do you really want me to leave?

581
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,360
No. I don't want you to leave.

582
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,520
I need you to go get Sam.
We got separated at the market.

583
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,280
Just stay put. We'll come to you.

584
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Be careful.

585
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,520
Stay safe.

586
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,080
At least we know she's okay.

587
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,480
Yeah.

588
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,080
We should probably go in now.

589
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,880
Yeah.

590
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:24,680
So long, sucker.

591
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,520
Hey, baby.

592
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,280
Hey. Baby...

593
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,120
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean anything
by that, baby.

594
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,520
- You have to find a way out.
- No, you're coming with me.

595
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,120
I can't. I'll slow you down.

596
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,160
- No. I'm not leaving you.
- You're gonna have to.

597
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,680
You'll move faster without me.

598
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,600
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

599
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,400
I'm gonna get their attention.

600
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:01,880
Wait, here. Take this.

601
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,720
Right here! Over here!

602
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,120
<i>You hear the sounds
that come in waves</i>

603
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,160
<i>By people dancing on a grave</i>

604
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,240
Here! Help! Over here! Help!

605
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,760
<i>And things are just
about to get depraved</i>

606
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,960
<i>We'll party. Party</i>

607
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,120
<i>Party to raise the dead</i>

608
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,640
<i>- Party</i>
- Come on.

609
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,480
<i>Party to raise the dead</i>

610
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,120
<i>'Cause once you're underground.
You won't hear a sound</i>

611
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,640
We got to go get him.
He hurt his foot.

612
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,720
We'll get him.

613
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Come on.

614
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,360
Hey, Sam.

615
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,880
It's gonna be all right.

616
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,400
He's dead because of me.

617
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,000
I don't know where my mom is,
and we got separated from Taani.

618
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,000
Taani's gonna be fine. She's the one
who told us where to find you.

619
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,360
- They didn't get her?
- No.

620
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,640
We're gonna get your mom
at the hospital...

621
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,640
and then we're gonna get Taani.
Don't you worry.

622
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:32,160
Thank you, Hunter.

623
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,520
- Let's be quick, Shaw.
- I'm on it.

624
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,200
See if you can text your mom.

625
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,040
- Still no signal.
- She could be anywhere.

626
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,560
I need to let her know that I'm here.

627
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,440
Anything we do
is gonna draw their attention.

628
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,520
Exactly.

629
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,600
I need to get to the nurse's station.

630
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,680
You're not going alone.

631
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,760
I know every inch of this place.
You two will just slow me down.

632
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,400
Take this. You're gonna need
to protect yourself.

633
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,320
- I know how to use a gun.
- You're not getting a gun.

634
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,680
Fine.

635
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,760
Awesome. Coast is clear.

636
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,280
Wait!

637
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,440
The patients are getting restless.

638
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:19,640
Time for their medicine.

639
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:40,600
<i>- Attention, please.</i>
- What's she doing?

640
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,080
- I don't know.
<i>- This is an important message...</i>

641
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,360
<i>for Dr. Kenzie Wright.</i>

642
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,720
Please come to the second floor
of the nurse's station...

643
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,520
to claim your daughter.

644
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,720
She's extremely worried...

645
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,240
and would like
to leave this freak show behind.

646
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:59,040
Can't hold them off for much longer.

647
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,000
I don't know what's worse,
their teeth...

648
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,560
Or their breath.

649
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Got any ideas?

650
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,320
Let's see if we can
shock some sense into them.

651
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,600
Let go! Please! Let go!

652
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,240
Hey. Sam's safe.

653
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,320
Is she on this floor?

654
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Down the hall.

655
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,360
Ray, take this.

656
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,040
You two guys been having a cookout?

657
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,120
Just go.

658
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Sam?

659
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,600
Sam, come on.

660
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,040
Sam?

661
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,400
Mom!

662
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,480
Come on. Grab her hands.
I'll get her feet.

663
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,240
Get your knife.

664
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,200
You're okay.

665
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,840
Come on. Let's go.

666
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,880
All right.

667
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,360
Wait. Hang on.
These ones are different.

668
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,960
Yeah, this is one of the ones
that started all this.

669
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,040
He came in on the waves.

670
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,240
It looks like
these guys were experimented on.

671
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:12,920
We got to get out.

672
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,160
Sam, Kenzie, stay by me. Come on.

673
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,960
All right, get in the car.

674
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,480
Go easy on Driscoll.
He doesn't like guests.

675
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:22,800
Dad!

676
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,120
You said you weren't going out.

677
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,920
Now this time,
you put your friend in danger.

678
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,760
I know. I'm sorry.

679
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,280
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

680
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,240
Oh my gosh. Are you all right?

681
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,920
- Have you been bitten?
- No, I haven't been.

682
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,640
No! No biters in the house.

683
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,720
I said I wasn't bitten.

684
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,960
Shaw.

685
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,360
Hey, before we bail, do you mind if
we use that radio to call for help?

686
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:07,680
Just don't mess up anything
on my desk.

687
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,440
This is Officer Kameo Akoni
of Emrys Bay.

688
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
We need assistance.

689
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Anyone out there?

690
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,080
It's quiet out there.

691
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,720
Cell towers are down.

692
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,920
There hasn't been any chatter
on the radio for hours.

693
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,080
Not that I'd want to talk to anybody.

694
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:42,920
We've had two tsunamis...

695
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,040
and no one has come
to check on us in town.

696
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,400
That should tell you
something right there.

697
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,640
Help has to be on the way.

698
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,360
Coast Guard's coming.

699
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:56,200
There's no one out there.

700
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Akoni?

701
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,680
What's going on down there?

702
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,800
- Akoni!
- Dad?

703
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,480
Akoni!

704
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,560
Run! It's coming!

705
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,240
Akoni!

706
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,200
- Dad!
- What the hell...

707
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:53,280
is going on down there?

708
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,680
Say something! Akoni!

709
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,280
- Stay back, Sam.
- Akoni!

710
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Mom!

711
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,080
Thanks, Driscoll.

712
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,920
No problem.

713
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,840
Way to go, Mom.

714
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,600
Everybody okay?

715
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Dad?

716
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,320
- Dad?
- I'm sorry.

717
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,760
- No.
- I'm sorry, baby.

718
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,120
I'm so sorry.

719
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,240
- No!
- I'm sorry.

720
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,320
No.

721
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,720
We can't stay here.

722
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:00,160
Place held up just fine
till you whackadoodles showed up.

723
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,520
Your little science project
that almost killed my daughter and I?

724
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,880
We can agree
that one's on you, right?

725
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,400
And exactly what were you doing
with your bunkmate down there?

726
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,040
Trying to figure out
what makes them tick.

727
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,400
- What'd you learn?
- The liquid inside it...

728
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,040
tested consistent with phosphorus.

729
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,800
That explains
the blue glow in the water.

730
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,720
The Taser is the only thing
I've seen that could stop it.

731
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,120
We stopped
a whole bunch in the hospital...

732
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,600
with electricity as well.

733
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,200
That's why I connected the Taser
to the sword.

734
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,800
Zombie nuts roasting on an open fire.

735
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,280
How are gonna kill them all
with one Taser?

736
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,240
Downed power lines.

737
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:35,000
I saw several of them at the beach,
but the grid is still running.

738
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,320
We use the tidal pools
to conduct the electricity.

739
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,760
All we need to do is
lure the zombies into the water...

740
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,040
and then we run the power to it.

741
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,680
- Fish in a barrel.
- But the ship is not in your barrel.

742
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,160
We're gonna have to
blow up that ship too.

743
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:47,800
If we can take care of
most of them...

744
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,400
then the Coast Guard can take care
of the stragglers when they get here.

745
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,160
If they get here.

746
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,920
Okay. How do we blow up the ship?

747
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,720
Here.

748
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:07,720
You can take this C4 with you.
You can take grenades.

749
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,560
You can even take this cereal
with you when you leave.

750
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,440
You're gonna leave, right?

751
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,440
I'll take the ones on land.

752
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,280
I guess
I'm the captain of the boat, huh?

753
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,000
What the hell do I know about C4?

754
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,520
Driscoll, we're gonna
need your help with that.

755
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,240
A lot of people are gonna die
unless we stop them.

756
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,160
All right. I'm in.

757
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,120
I'll clear a path,
and we'll all make a run for it.

758
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:57,760
Come on.

759
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
What's wrong?

760
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,680
His Taser isn't working.
He needs my help.

761
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:14,360
Come on.

762
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,320
Fire up the wood chipper.

763
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,400
It's feeding time.

764
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,440
Nice moves.

765
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:12,040
Thanks.

766
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,760
Come on, Driscoll! Come on, let's go!

767
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,080
You're gonna have
some good roses this year.

768
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,680
- Yeah.
- Come on.

769
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,960
- Let's go.
- No, you come on. Let's go.

770
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,680
Hurry up. It's over here.

771
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,400
Hey, wait a minute, man! Wait!

772
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,200
All right. Watch your step.

773
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,640
Hey.

774
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,640
Look, if anything happens to me,
just take care of Sam, okay?

775
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,200
Nothing's gonna happen
to either of you.

776
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:58,680
I promise.

777
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,280
Should have just
followed my instincts...

778
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,640
motored to another port
where it's safe.

779
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,560
So that's why you live in a boat?

780
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,880
So you can take off
when things get rough?

781
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,160
I always knew you weren't
the settling-down type of guy...

782
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,240
Hunter.

783
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Knowing that made it easier
to be friends without getting hurt.

784
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:25,840
Seeing you and Sam at the hospital...

785
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,520
risking everything
to get back to each other...

786
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:32,400
Taani and her dad
doing the same thing.

787
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,160
I thought I had it all.

788
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:36,680
Made me realize...

789
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,040
I don't have anything.

790
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,880
Aw, hell no.

791
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,480
Look, y'all been
beating around the bush for months.

792
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:47,760
This ain't no time for canoodling.

793
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,800
Sam!

794
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:57,360
Come on.

795
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:00,160
Come on.

796
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,640
Thank you.

797
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,080
Yeah.

798
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,280
We both know
how this is going to end.

799
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,960
It's not over till it's over.

800
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,960
Doesn't anyone else think it's weird
that he ain't turned yet?

801
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,080
They didn't bite through his head
and penetrate his skull...

802
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,600
didn't get to the brain.

803
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,720
I've been watching on my monitors.
It takes longer through the skin.

804
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,000
Town's in your hands now, Hunter.

805
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,240
Take care of it.

806
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,840
And take care of them.

807
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,320
Do it better than I did.

808
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,200
What's that supposed to mean?

809
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,080
I'll tell you what I know.

810
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:54,240
Revok Pharmaceuticals
came here 30 years ago.

811
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:55,760
They claimed
to be making major strides...

812
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,760
with a new anti-aging drug.

813
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,920
<i>They needed to test it on humans...</i>

814
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,320
<i>away from FDA scrutiny
in the United States.</i>

815
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,200
They brought in staff,
patients, security...

816
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:11,040
and the local council leaders and I
just needed to make sure...

817
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,080
that everything stayed off the radar.

818
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,040
They paid us.

819
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,560
They financed trips...

820
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,280
and they made sure that my wife...

821
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:25,960
got the best medical treatment...

822
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,200
before she passed on.

823
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,680
If you wouldn't mind
fast-forwarding to the part...

824
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,320
where the zombies come to town...

825
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,920
I think we'd all appreciate it.

826
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,840
They lied.

827
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,720
The drug wasn't ready.

828
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,520
They shouldn't have been
trying it on humans.

829
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,720
There are hideous side effects...

830
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,400
and they knew
we couldn't say anything, because...

831
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:46,160
we were all complicit.

832
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,120
How could you allow this, Kameo?

833
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,680
By the time
we realized what they were doing...

834
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,920
they'd shipped out
all the patients and staff.

835
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,800
But in the back of my mind...

836
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,120
I knew they sunk the ship.

837
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:02,760
When Hunter tied the boat at
the bottom of the ocean to Revok...

838
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,000
<i>there was no denying
what I had been a party to...</i>

839
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,800
what I had done.

840
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,200
You're not seeing
the bigger play here.

841
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:13,440
The trials actually worked.

842
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,040
Those patients' hideous reactions
were not side effects.

843
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,680
They were the desired effects.

844
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
So they developed a drug...

845
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,160
that would weaponize
an entire population...

846
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,120
one that would destroy itself
from within?

847
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,000
A biological weapon is worth
more on the black market...

848
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,680
than any anti-aging drug.

849
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:38,960
Come on. Let's move.

850
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,280
Go!

851
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,520
I got this, guys.

852
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,720
Run!

853
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,840
Go! Keep going!

854
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,880
Come on.

855
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:45,600
Daddy, come...

856
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:53,760
- Wasp knife?
- Yeah.

857
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Got another?

858
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,160
Have this one.
Don't you have enough toys already?

859
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,320
No.

860
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:08,640
I love you.

861
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,280
Grab the bag. Let's go.

862
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,320
Okay.

863
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:46,640
All right. Let's get to it.
Come on, Taani.

864
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,240
I'll catch up.

865
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,520
All right,
call me if you get into any trouble.

866
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,600
Driscoll, what about the ones
still up at your house?

867
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,240
You didn't think
I took all the C4 with me, did you?

868
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:56,360
Ray...

869
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,280
see you on the other side.

870
01:08:58,360 --> 01:08:59,480
You too, brother.

871
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,800
Hey, man, is that stuff stable?

872
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,080
Stable as I am.

873
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,880
Move out my way.

874
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,720
There it is.

875
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,120
All right, the fuses blew
when the lines went down.

876
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,360
I can make the downed power lines
active again.

877
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,920
I'm gonna use those tidal pools
to complete the circuit.

878
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,600
Then we'll reset the breaker.

879
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:00,640
Once we do that,
the power's gonna flow.

880
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:01,720
We're gonna have to hurry.

881
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,240
I'll get the lines in the water.
Stay here.

882
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:05,760
Don't hit that switch
until I tell you. Got it?

883
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,840
Yeah.

884
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,800
Time to kick some ass.

885
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,120
All right, hit it!

886
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,280
Guys...

887
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,160
we've got to hurry.
They're getting close.

888
01:11:02,920 --> 01:11:05,040
I still don't understand
why I have to be the one...

889
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,880
to secure the bombs
to the sunken ship.

890
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:08,280
Because I have to
drive this thing away...

891
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,720
before the detonator goes off.

892
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,920
That's your stuff,
and I'm not putting her in the water.

893
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,320
Okay, fine.

894
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:17,200
I'll make sure
the C4 locks on to the boat.

895
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,560
Up to you to do the rest.

896
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:20,880
I got it.

897
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,120
I don't know
why I keep saying "yes" to everybody.

898
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:27,360
I don't even like people.

899
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,600
Maybe 'cause
you're kind of a good guy.

900
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:32,480
Nope.

901
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:37,800
Okay. It worked.

902
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,200
- And now we got to get the zombies.
- We need bait.

903
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
Okay.

904
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,360
I'm gonna Pied Piper them
to follow me into the tidal pools.

905
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,720
- Once I do...
- We'll pull the switch.

906
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:51,920
Exactly.

907
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:04,760
Hey!

908
01:12:05,640 --> 01:12:06,760
Come and get it!

909
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,440
Come over here!

910
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,040
Come on! Come and get it!

911
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:18,840
Over here!

912
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,720
Hey, over here!

913
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:29,280
Oh yeah.

914
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:32,840
Come and get it. Come on!

915
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,320
Throw me the C4 once I go in.

916
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:00,320
Time to fight crazy with crazy.

917
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,440
Driscoll, get out the water! Move!

918
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,160
Move!

919
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:26,120
Move, Driscoll! Move!

920
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,120
No!

921
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,440
Go up front.

922
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:20,640
- Hunter needs help.
- You stay here!

923
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:22,520
Be careful!

924
01:14:29,080 --> 01:14:30,320
Come on.

925
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:57,120
Now! Throw the switch!

926
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,240
Okay.

927
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,080
Hurry. They're close.

928
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,800
Put this vest on. Get in the water.

929
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:23,600
It's not happening.

930
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,840
- Taani!
- No.

931
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,080
Look, when that anchor
hits the bottom...

932
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:35,400
- this boat is not going anywhere.
- Your point?

933
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:38,480
If your dad was here...

934
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,320
he'd kick my butt
if I didn't kick you off my boat...

935
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,200
- so I'm kicking you off my boat!
- Okay.

936
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:45,640
When you get in the water,
hold the vest...

937
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,080
lay back, and ride the wave.

938
01:16:50,240 --> 01:16:51,320
What about the zombies?

939
01:16:51,680 --> 01:16:53,160
Don't worry about them.

940
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,120
They don't have a prayer.

941
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,680
It's not working!

942
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:15,720
Come on.

943
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:54,480
Mom!

944
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,320
It worked.

945
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,000
Hey, Hunter. It's Ray. Come in.

946
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,800
<i>Hunter, do you copy?</i>

947
01:18:15,520 --> 01:18:17,880
Ray, we got them.
What's going on out there?

948
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,640
It's a little rough out here...

949
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,000
but I'm about to catch the big one.

950
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,080
Oh no.

951
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,040
Come on, Hunter!

952
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,240
Come on.

953
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:06,040
Oh my...

954
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,400
Hey.

955
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,480
I didn't think you made it.

956
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:15,600
Looks like we got most of them.

957
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:22,000
Mom. Come on.

958
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,880
Taani?

959
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,840
I've got you.

960
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,320
Help.

961
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:31,480
Are you okay?

962
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:33,520
It's okay.

963
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:35,880
Sit down.

964
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,120
What about Ray?

965
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,440
You're gonna be okay.

966
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:50,400
A little bruised up,
but you just need rest.

967
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,280
Are you still leaving?

968
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,120
Not on your life, Kenzie.

969
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,640
Good, 'cause you still owe me dinner.

970
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,840
And wine.

971
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,400
And a movie.

972
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,440
Anything else?

973
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:23,360
It's about time.

974
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:26,040
Finally.

975
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Come on.

976
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:38,880
What are we gonna do now?

977
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,120
Whatever we do,
we're doing it together.
