as part of THE E.U. Media Program

00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:30,038
Restored with the cooperation of

00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:43,940
ZERO FOR CONDUCT!

5
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,129
<i>Oh the village's prime...</i>

6
00:02:50,249 --> 00:02:54,969
<i>...you're odorous of thyme...</i>

7
00:02:55,597 --> 00:02:59,415
<i>...and whenever you ramble...</i>

8
00:02:59,535 --> 00:03:03,463
<i>...you make my poor heart tremble...</i>

9
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,739
<i>Oh the village's pride...</i>

10
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,987
<i>...whose will you be bride...</i>

11
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:15,826
<i>...whoever will be wedded...</i>

12
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:19,498
<i>...to a girl so dearly yearned...</i>

13
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:25,322
<i>Come to your window, my darling...</i>

14
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:28,451
<i>...can't you hear me moaning...</i>

15
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:33,294
<i>When your face comes up shining...</i>

16
00:03:33,774 --> 00:03:36,569
<i>...moon goes out of its glowing...</i>

17
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,495
<i>Let me see you shortly, will you...</i>

18
00:03:41,615 --> 00:03:45,542
<i>...don't deny me this...</i>

19
00:03:45,662 --> 00:03:49,735
<i>...so I can quiet down and leave you...</i>

20
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:53,261
<i>...sleep again in peace...</i>

21
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:57,621
<i>Oh those eyes of sweetness...</i>

22
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:01,710
<i>...are the reason for my grievance...</i>

23
00:04:02,595 --> 00:04:06,037
<i>...my poor heart's all heavy...</i>

24
00:04:06,815 --> 00:04:10,771
<i>I can swear to you my lady...</i>

25
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,271
Someone's coming!
Go, Fotis!

26
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:59,566
- Good night Bilio!
- Good night.

27
00:05:02,904 --> 00:05:05,887
<i>Love me oh love me dearie...</i>

28
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,344
<i>...my precious expectation...</i>

29
00:05:10,116 --> 00:05:13,328
<i>...just like I fell in love with you...</i>

30
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:16,583
<i>...during our premier session...</i>

31
00:05:19,543 --> 00:05:22,798
<i>Your eyes were looking down and low...</i>

32
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:25,718
<i>...focusing on your school desk...</i>

33
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,916
<i>...as for your pretty little hands...</i>

34
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:34,154
<i>...were paging through...</i>

35
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:35,483
<i>...a text-</i>

36
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:36,611
<i>-book!</i>

37
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:48,121
ONE-CLASS SEMI-GYMNASIUM
FOR FEMALES

38
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,403
- Hello, Sir Teacher.
- Hello, Manolis.

39
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:54,322
Eeh, what's with your eye?

40
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,041
Is it obvious?

41
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:02,020
Last night I was attacked by five men.
They mistook me for someone else.

42
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:06,025
It goes without saying
that I fought back.

43
00:06:06,145 --> 00:06:09,133
- I overpowered all five of them.
- And your eye?

44
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,986
It got overpowered too.

45
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,466
<i>She's coming! She's coming!</i>

46
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,433
Good morning, girls!

47
00:06:39,553 --> 00:06:40,801
Good morning!

48
00:06:52,366 --> 00:06:55,787
If you would allow me, Ms. Headmistress,
jasmins for you!

49
00:06:55,907 --> 00:06:58,791
- Thank you, child. How kind!
- You're welcome!

50
00:07:08,264 --> 00:07:10,551
So then, today it's a History class.

51
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:12,954
As I already told you yesterday

52
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:15,491
Alexander the Great, even from puberty,

53
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:18,640
<i>gave indications of his bravery
and intelligence.</i>

54
00:07:19,068 --> 00:07:21,171
<i>In his father Phillipos' stables</i>

55
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,200
<i>there was a steed named Voukephalas</i>

56
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,280
This steed

57
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,399
was ever so defiant...

58
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:30,719
and wild...

59
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,905
that absolutely no one

60
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,759
was capable of riding him...

61
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,222
<i>Riding him I say,
no one was capable of!</i>

62
00:07:39,823 --> 00:07:41,743
<i>One day Alexander</i>

63
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,263
<i>saw Voukephalas
and admired him. </i>

64
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,882
<i>He then decided</i>

65
00:07:46,002 --> 00:07:47,195
<i>to tame him...</i>

66
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:50,733
Aaah! Help me!
A weevil !

67
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,119
There it is!

68
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,671
Someone catch it!

69
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:55,423
Oooh, mummy!

70
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:05,449
I caught it! I caught it!

71
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,474
Aaah, I can't...

72
00:08:10,008 --> 00:08:12,044
I can't have a class today...

73
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:13,997
I am much too excited!

74
00:08:14,117 --> 00:08:15,599
The History lesson

75
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,058
will be instructed by you, Bilio.

76
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:19,744
Yes, Ms. Headmistress!

77
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:29,768
- Get well soon, Ms. Headmistress!
- Thank you.

78
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:32,831
Farewell, 'bye!

79
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,437
Keep quiet, girls! Quiet!

80
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:43,341
<i>We don't want a class!</i>

81
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:47,480
Who said there is one?

82
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,227
We'll do some singing!

83
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:54,694
I'll sing the latest hit in Athens
for you! I heard it on the radio!

84
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,618
<i>Oh, when will all these classes
ever finish...</i>

85
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:11,626
<i>so I can step outside in
real-life contest...</i>

86
00:09:11,746 --> 00:09:14,583
<i>How do I long to flirt and love
and how I wish...</i>

87
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:16,949
<i>...I'd make a real woman's conquest...</i>

88
00:09:17,069 --> 00:09:19,973
<i>I'm all so tired of constantly
beholding...</i>

89
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:23,228
<i>the classroom desks, the teacher
and the sessions...</i>

90
00:09:23,348 --> 00:09:26,098
<i>and now I'm craving for
a husband's fondling...</i>

91
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:28,301
<i>with genuine desire and obsession...</i>

92
00:09:28,421 --> 00:09:30,838
<i>I want somebody to favor...</i>

93
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:33,308
<i>be his faithful darling wife...</i>

94
00:09:33,702 --> 00:09:36,107
<i>He is to be a handsome fellow...</i>

95
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:38,667
<i>keen on pleasing me for life...</i>

96
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,405
<i>He should make me a heap of presents...</i>

97
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:44,309
<i>ever sweetly talk to me...</i>

98
00:09:44,862 --> 00:09:47,248
<i>night and day when in my presence...</i>

99
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:50,046
<i>he's to kiss me wooingly...</i>

100
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,246
<i>For my hair he must be zealous...</i>

101
00:09:53,366 --> 00:09:55,474
<i>and stroke it longingly...</i>

102
00:09:56,174 --> 00:09:58,845
<i>Also want him to be jealous...</i>

103
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:01,298
<i>like Othello ragingly ...</i>

104
00:10:01,749 --> 00:10:04,235
<i>He must constantly be training...</i>

105
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,438
<i>in this sporting love of his...</i>

106
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:10,474
<i>yet not in the least refraining...</i>

107
00:10:10,594 --> 00:10:12,995
<i>when I whisper in his ears...</i>

108
00:10:13,115 --> 00:10:15,849
<i>For my hair he must be zealous...</i>

109
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:18,417
<i>and stroke it longingly...</i>

110
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:21,318
<i>Also want him to be jealous...</i>

111
00:10:21,685 --> 00:10:23,955
<i>like Othello ragingly...</i>

112
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:27,293
<i>He must constantly be training...</i>

113
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:29,296
<i>in this sporting love of his...</i>

114
00:10:30,233 --> 00:10:32,653
<i>yet not in the least refraining...</i>

115
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,491
<i>when I whisper in his ears...</i>

116
00:10:36,542 --> 00:10:37,994
Zero for conduct !!!

117
00:11:18,197 --> 00:11:22,369
You look at your watch much too often,
Mr. Fotis. Time for your medicine?

118
00:11:23,289 --> 00:11:24,875
The medicine of love!

119
00:11:24,995 --> 00:11:27,979
He longs for noontime,
when the school finishes!

120
00:11:30,373 --> 00:11:33,174
Why are you having me on, boys?
I'm a young man!

121
00:11:33,294 --> 00:11:35,327
It's no shame to love a girl.

122
00:11:35,447 --> 00:11:36,799
She'll be my wife.

123
00:11:37,469 --> 00:11:38,353
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

124
00:11:38,854 --> 00:11:41,508
You may say so, but her father objects!

125
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:44,028
If the bride and the groom want it...

126
00:11:44,148 --> 00:11:46,134
<i>father-in-law has no saying...</i>

127
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:48,654
Come boys, finish up and enjoy lunch!

128
00:11:48,954 --> 00:11:49,822
So long!

129
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,171
By the prayers of our holy fathers,

130
00:12:27,636 --> 00:12:29,906
Lord Jesus Christ our God,

131
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:32,659
have mercy upon us and save us.
Amen.

132
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,159
Please, be quiet!

133
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:42,545
- Bilio Foundouka!
<i>- Present!</i>

134
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,817
<i>You're detained.
You'll leave an hour later!</i>

135
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,953
- But...
- No buts! Keep silent!

136
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:49,734
No buts!
I have spoken!

137
00:12:50,113 --> 00:12:52,583
The rest may leave.
In absolute quiet!

138
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:54,288
Enjoy your lunch, Sir!

139
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:17,576
- What happened with Bilio?
- Who knows?

140
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,063
She did well in the oral test anyway.

141
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:23,807
- He detains her every day.
- Well, 3 times a week for sure.

142
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:27,612
You see, he's in love and wants
to keep her close to him.

143
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:29,748
Oh, I wish I was, too...

144
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:34,996
<i>All around in circle and Manolis
in the middle...</i>

145
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:39,085
<i>who's living a great life
with plenty of wine...</i>

146
00:13:40,044 --> 00:13:41,797
Eeeh! The Headmistress!

147
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,477
Girls!

148
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,205
<i>Enjoy lunch, Ms. Headmistress!</i>

149
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,057
Where's Bilio?

150
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:01,561
Well, as usual...

151
00:14:01,681 --> 00:14:04,098
- She's detained?
- Until 1 o'clock.

152
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,184
- What did she do?
- Nothing.

153
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:09,991
- Was it it the teacher or the
Headmistress? - Him, of course.

154
00:14:12,014 --> 00:14:14,851
You'll copy 2 pages from
Modern Greek Texts.

155
00:14:14,971 --> 00:14:17,345
- You heard me, Bilio?
- I heard you.

156
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:27,050
TUTORIAL ROOM

157
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,972
Have you not departed yet,
Mrs. Melpomeni?

158
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:46,118
- I've been expecting you, Mr. Plato!
- Oh, have you?

159
00:14:46,238 --> 00:14:50,057
Are you forgetting that I've invited
you to dine with me today?

160
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:52,695
- Dine with you?
- Have you forgotten?

161
00:14:52,815 --> 00:14:56,117
I have prepared cuttlefish in red
sauce, your favorite!

162
00:14:56,237 --> 00:14:58,734
Oh, you have! Too bad I'd forgotten it!

163
00:14:59,686 --> 00:15:00,854
Oh, you brute!

164
00:15:01,538 --> 00:15:03,474
But it is of no importance.

165
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,260
I'm reminding you of it!

166
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,907
Unfortunately I cannot come.

167
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:10,596
I've a detained student
writing in there.

168
00:15:10,716 --> 00:15:14,135
But until you've warmed up the
cuttlefish, I'll be there.

169
00:15:14,255 --> 00:15:17,205
- Your word on it?
- Of course, Mrs.Headmistress!

170
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:20,126
Oh, don't call me that!
Besides, I'm a Miss.

171
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:22,620
You may simply call me Melpomeni.

172
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,157
Believe me, I adore you!

173
00:15:25,608 --> 00:15:29,530
When you've become certain of my eros
for you, you'll love me too!

174
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:34,340
<i>I'm headed towards the preparation
of the cuttlefish!</i> - Do that.

175
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,742
<i>In anticipation!</i>

176
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,461
I'll be there.

177
00:15:37,845 --> 00:15:41,133
Unless I become cuttlefish myself
and eject some ink...

178
00:15:50,831 --> 00:15:52,935
ROMEO AND JULIET

179
00:16:46,762 --> 00:16:47,646
Manolis!

180
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:50,100
Yes, what?

181
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,224
Ah, it's you, Mr. Fotis?

182
00:16:56,588 --> 00:16:58,774
Manolis, is the Teacher still in?

183
00:16:58,894 --> 00:16:59,792
<i>Yeah...</i>

184
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:01,394
- And...?
- Yeah...

185
00:17:01,514 --> 00:17:02,997
<i>- Bilio?</i>
- Yeah...

186
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:05,250
<i>- What's "yeah" for?</i>
- Yeah...

187
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,967
- Why is Bilio still in?
<i>- Don't know...</i>

188
00:17:08,087 --> 00:17:10,220
- You must know! Say it!
<i>- Naah...</i>

189
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,607
- Are you kidding me?
- Naah... No!

190
00:17:12,727 --> 00:17:14,025
She's detained.

191
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,995
<i>What for?
I'll go see why!</i>

192
00:17:16,115 --> 00:17:19,118
No, Mr. Fotis, you can't go in.
It's prohibited.

193
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:20,353
Alright.

194
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:23,407
I'll wait till she comes out
and settle this.

195
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,299
- Hello, lady!
- Take those in!

196
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,833
But it's noon, the cuttlefish is ready!

197
00:17:28,953 --> 00:17:32,758
It's an emergency! Horrible things
are happening in the village!

198
00:17:32,878 --> 00:17:34,343
You're alarming me!

199
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:38,091
The world has gone astray, Helen!
If only I told you that...

200
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:42,046
You don't say!

201
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:45,343
Jesus help us! We've become
Sodora and Gommoda (sic)!

202
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,943
Mind you, don't speak a word
to anyone!

203
00:17:48,063 --> 00:17:50,047
Can such things be spoken out?

204
00:18:00,134 --> 00:18:01,887
Is the meal ready, Tasso?

205
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:06,386
It's ready, Master but Bilio has
not come back from school yet.

206
00:18:06,753 --> 00:18:08,906
She hasn't? But what's the time?

207
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,576
There! The half hour is striking.

208
00:18:12,816 --> 00:18:15,344
The teacher must have
detained her again.

209
00:18:15,464 --> 00:18:18,331
<i>- If she doesn't study?</i>
- What does that mean?

210
00:18:18,451 --> 00:18:22,287
Even if she doesn't, the President's
daughter cannot be detained!

211
00:18:22,407 --> 00:18:25,713
I'll write to the MP and have
the teacher transferred.

212
00:18:29,086 --> 00:18:32,298
- Bring lunch, I'll eat alone!
- As you wish, Master.

213
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:34,493
It must be her.

214
00:18:38,448 --> 00:18:41,953
What? It's you Ms. Headmistress?
Anything wrong with Bilio?

215
00:18:42,073 --> 00:18:46,294
Be calm, Mr. President. Nothing's wrong
but I must talk to you.

216
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,654
You see now, best woman?
The world has gone astray!

217
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:52,856
Yes, it did!

218
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:56,644
- But don't you speak a word!
- Can such things be spoken out?

219
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:05,597
Listen to this!...

220
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,735
Shameful things!

221
00:19:21,347 --> 00:19:23,333
How can that be!
How can it!

222
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:26,587
What's up, Thodoris?
What are you mumbling about?

223
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,074
Stelios, does your girl go to school?

224
00:19:29,194 --> 00:19:31,823
Sure she does! Shouldn't she
be educated?

225
00:19:31,943 --> 00:19:34,857
<i>Then, this is the teacher of our
school, Plato.</i>

226
00:19:34,977 --> 00:19:36,977
<i>And these... are the students!</i>

227
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:38,545
Students?

228
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,924
Our girls, whom we trust him with
for their education!

229
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:46,363
Hold it, Thodoris! If you're not crazy
you'd better explain what you mean!

230
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:50,793
What I said! This very moment, the
teacher has kept a girl alone in class!

231
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:53,078
If this is true, he's done for!

232
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,680
My girl perhaps?

233
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,041
I don't know which one it is but
I know this: He must leave the village!

234
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,061
- Let's find out!
- Let's!

235
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,485
Well, quit writing now, Bilio!

236
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,171
No, I'll write it all!

237
00:20:29,707 --> 00:20:32,628
<i>I see you've taken your
detention seriously...</i>

238
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:40,259
Don't you know the way I feel
about you?

239
00:20:40,379 --> 00:20:42,548
Feel my heartbeats with your hand!

240
00:20:51,254 --> 00:20:52,756
Go back home, Bilio!

241
00:20:57,646 --> 00:20:58,881
Not this way!

242
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:01,668
The way I got in, so that
nobody sees you.

243
00:21:08,512 --> 00:21:09,663
As for you...

244
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:33,963
What's the time?

245
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,523
- Ten to one.
<i>- Ta!</i>

246
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:44,614
What's up people?
Where are you off to?

247
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:47,089
- Come with us!
- But where to?

248
00:21:47,209 --> 00:21:50,694
- Come for the village's honor!
- The honor, yes! Let's go!

249
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:54,733
For the village's honor!

250
00:21:54,853 --> 00:21:56,565
The teacher must leave!

251
00:21:56,685 --> 00:21:59,202
Don't sit there drinking!
Come with us!

252
00:21:59,322 --> 00:22:00,921
For the village honor!

253
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:03,208
The teacher is groping our girls!

254
00:22:04,384 --> 00:22:06,220
<i>You too! Come on everyone!</i>

255
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,234
Come together everyone, let's go!

256
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,405
The teacher must leave!

257
00:22:21,209 --> 00:22:22,378
For our honor!

258
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,644
Wait, Mr. President!
There must not be a scandal.

259
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,863
But no! I must go there at once!

260
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,328
<i>The teacher must leave!</i>

261
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:54,572
That scoundrel!
The beast!

262
00:22:56,152 --> 00:22:58,121
We'll crush him!

263
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:10,733
<i>Send him away!</i>

264
00:23:29,393 --> 00:23:32,113
Manolis, help me carry him
into the office!

265
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:34,233
Yeah... But what's the matter?

266
00:23:34,353 --> 00:23:36,820
You know or heard nothing,
you hear?

267
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,929
No, no...

268
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:55,914
Now you be careful!

269
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,702
Don't mention the girl or
you're done for!

270
00:24:22,977 --> 00:24:25,180
Hold it! He's surrendering!

271
00:24:26,478 --> 00:24:28,298
He's- sur-rendering!

272
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:30,100
<i>He's- sur-rendering!</i>

273
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:41,197
Here comes the President!

274
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:46,089
Quiet down! I'm fully informed!
We'll sort everything out!

275
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,629
You all stay here.
I'll settle the whole thing.

276
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:58,916
Stay here, stay!

277
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:23,230
You scoundrel!
Shut up, I know everything!

278
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:25,543
I really should kill you

279
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:29,574
but you're lucky I don't want a scandal
about my daughter! Shut up!

280
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:32,595
You shut it too!

281
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:34,398
Padlock your mouth!

282
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,000
Shut it!

283
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,557
Teacher, you're leaving the village
first thing tomorrow!

284
00:25:45,914 --> 00:25:47,149
Here he comes!

285
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,036
Dear fellow inhabitans!

286
00:25:50,156 --> 00:25:53,875
Looks like the accusation was only
an unsubstantial suspicion.

287
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,356
Satan has enveloped him!

288
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,042
Send the teacher away!

289
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:03,149
But because our village cannot
stand even suspicions...

290
00:26:05,613 --> 00:26:07,733
not even a shadow of a doubt...

291
00:26:07,853 --> 00:26:09,568
the teacher is leaving!

292
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:10,904
Throw him out!

293
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,170
EPAM. BRIBECOME
M.P.

294
00:27:19,645 --> 00:27:21,063
Dear Mr. Bribecome

295
00:27:21,183 --> 00:27:24,435
We are fine and healthy and wish
the same for you too.

296
00:27:24,555 --> 00:27:28,507
We kicked out the teacher you appointed
for us because he was not OK

297
00:27:28,627 --> 00:27:32,950
and we're asking you as our MP to
appoint a female teacher for our village

298
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,353
This is the whole village's demand.

299
00:27:35,473 --> 00:27:38,658
Panayotis Foundoukas
President of Kondoskali Village

300
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:45,291
Is my personal assistant still in?

301
00:27:49,594 --> 00:27:52,632
- He's in alright, damn him...
- What's happened?

302
00:27:52,752 --> 00:27:54,267
He tried to kiss me.

303
00:27:54,387 --> 00:27:58,484
You should make him understand
you're not the kind of girl to be kissed

304
00:27:58,604 --> 00:27:59,987
by just anyone...

305
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:12,290
Excuse me, I didn't know there was
a conference going on.

306
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,272
You see now Maria? Then they both
got embarrassed and blushed too!

307
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,764
I was telling Maria...

308
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:32,374
that I caught a fellow MP yesterday
with his typist and...

309
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:35,064
you know...
- I see, I see...

310
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:40,406
- Anything else for today?
- Just a letter.

311
00:28:40,526 --> 00:28:42,593
What's the second bag for, then?

312
00:28:42,713 --> 00:28:46,281
Because when I get into the Ministry
with 2 bags they believe

313
00:28:46,401 --> 00:28:48,389
that you are quite a busy man

314
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,309
so your prestige goes up!

315
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:53,263
Well done, Mihalis!
I'm raising your salary!

316
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:54,798
You're kind, Sir!

317
00:28:55,054 --> 00:28:56,823
What's this letter about?

318
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,743
<i>The Kondoskali issue again.</i>

319
00:28:58,863 --> 00:29:01,963
<i>It's from the President's rival
pharmacist Mr.Bandage.</i>

320
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:05,085
- What does he want?
- He says malignancy reigns there.

321
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:07,879
They sent away this holy man,
the teacher

322
00:29:07,999 --> 00:29:12,419
and prefer a female teacher instead.
The majority of the villagers, dear MP,

323
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:15,874
wants the male teacher back.
<i>- Now, here comes trouble...</i>

324
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:17,651
What's to be done, then?

325
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:21,740
Our lists will tell us, dear boy!
Whoever gets the majority of votes.

326
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,609
<i>I'm afraid I'm mixed-up</i>

327
00:29:24,077 --> 00:29:27,145
<i>whoever should I choose,
Kiki or Coco...</i>

328
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:30,109
Kondoskali... Kondoskali...

329
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,631
Here it is!

330
00:29:34,548 --> 00:29:37,235
Pharmacist Bandage,
former group leader...

331
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:40,272
yesteryear powerful,
has recently lost status...

332
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:42,765
estimated votes: 132. Mmm?

333
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,553
Foundoukas... Foundoukas...

334
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,464
But shouldn't we find out

335
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:53,752
who's right and why they
rejected the teacher?

336
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:58,025
<i>Aaah, and look for a haystack needle?
Are we judges or politicians here?</i>

337
00:29:58,145 --> 00:30:00,470
Well, of course we're in politics...

338
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,720
Then you must know that in politics,
"right" is what most voters want.

339
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,029
Foundoukas...

340
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:10,215
Votes: 298...

341
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,385
Not bad at all...

342
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:15,456
<i>But does Kondoskali actually
have so many voters?</i>

343
00:30:15,576 --> 00:30:17,492
If you include the dead ones!

344
00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:19,538
When the President is a shark

345
00:30:19,658 --> 00:30:21,891
even the dead like Lazarus vote too!

346
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:24,879
So, there's no doubt about it!

347
00:30:24,999 --> 00:30:27,182
We're sending a female teacher there

348
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:30,926
so inform the Ministry of Education
quickly! <i>- Yes, Mr. Bribecome!</i>

349
00:30:31,046 --> 00:30:33,850
And send them both a telegram.
But... hold it!

350
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:37,304
You don't look well, today.
Is anything wrong?

351
00:30:37,424 --> 00:30:39,507
Something tragic, Mr. Bribecome.

352
00:30:39,627 --> 00:30:41,987
I failed the Law School entrance exams!

353
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:43,877
And you're sad about that?

354
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:48,667
What did I get out of studying myself
blind and graduating with an A?

355
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,609
When I started my practice as a lawyer
I lost all my cases

356
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:57,598
and those who won them had got their
diplomas via their contacts.

357
00:30:58,407 --> 00:31:01,286
I tried to play fair
and lost all the games...

358
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:04,132
I went back to the village
penniless

359
00:31:04,252 --> 00:31:06,518
and I started promising and lying...

360
00:31:07,086 --> 00:31:08,204
As a result?

361
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:10,758
I was voted for MP!

362
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:14,004
- Then you believe anyone can...
- Become an MP?

363
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,038
Easiest thing in the world!

364
00:31:16,589 --> 00:31:19,960
You receive some grants...
Soon you get a nice pension...

365
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,783
And one fine morning
you become a Minister!

366
00:31:24,035 --> 00:31:26,271
Now go out there
and don't worry!

367
00:31:53,613 --> 00:31:56,149
Eeeh, welcome dear Plato!
How are you?

368
00:31:56,269 --> 00:31:58,970
- Wait till I tell you...
- I know already.

369
00:31:59,090 --> 00:32:00,956
- Know what?
- You blew it!

370
00:32:01,076 --> 00:32:03,278
- Letters have arrived.
- Letters?

371
00:32:03,398 --> 00:32:06,716
Let's talk inside. Or would
you rather sit in the park?

372
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:09,453
- As you like, Mihalis.
- Let's go, then!

373
00:32:09,753 --> 00:32:12,539
Plato, you split Kondoskali
into two parties.

374
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,852
One of them rejects you
and the other one wants you!

375
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:18,372
So it's the love bug, isn't it?

376
00:32:18,492 --> 00:32:21,762
I adore her! If I don't see her
again I'll kill myself!

377
00:32:21,882 --> 00:32:23,831
Come now, that's too tragic!

378
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:25,767
I'm late for the Ministry.

379
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,553
So it's final? Nothing can be done?

380
00:32:28,673 --> 00:32:32,542
Nothing, my friend. Bribecome was
explicit about a female teacher.

381
00:32:32,662 --> 00:32:36,130
<i>You see you're a male teacher.
If only you were a female...</i>

382
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,846
<i>it might be possible.</i>

383
00:32:38,514 --> 00:32:39,616
<i>Bye, Plato!</i>

384
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:41,084
Bye, Mihalis!

385
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,471
<i>If you were a female...
A female...</i>

386
00:32:44,205 --> 00:32:45,140
Mihalis!

387
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:50,171
Finally we got rid of the nightmare!

388
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:53,576
Well, you know a thing
like that couldn't have happened.

389
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:57,832
I don't know that. I love you so much
that I'm jealous of my shadow too.

390
00:32:57,952 --> 00:33:00,765
If I couldn't send him away
I'd strangle him!

391
00:33:00,885 --> 00:33:02,067
Oh, silly boy!

392
00:33:03,252 --> 00:33:07,475
I'm mostly concerned about my father
who doesn't want you for a son-in-law.

393
00:33:07,595 --> 00:33:09,605
If you want me, he will, too.

394
00:33:32,058 --> 00:33:33,793
What are you staring at?

395
00:33:33,913 --> 00:33:35,229
Ah, that rock...

396
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:38,200
I admire it 'cause it has
the sea at its feet!

397
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,827
Even when staring at the shore
you're thinking of the sea.

398
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,411
<i>In my life I've always
cast my nets wide...</i>

399
00:34:00,175 --> 00:34:03,579
<i>once in the seas and
recently at shore...</i>

400
00:34:05,133 --> 00:34:09,348
<i>Just a reveller who'd put
all love aside...</i>

401
00:34:10,176 --> 00:34:14,118
<i>but my time has finally come,
I'm sure...</i>

402
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:20,709
<i>In your nets of purest love
I have been captured...</i>

403
00:34:21,845 --> 00:34:25,903
<i>in the manner I once would
cast them too...</i>

404
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,122
<i>By your fondling I have been
enraptured...</i>

405
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,049
<i>and that bait of your eyes
I gazed into...</i>

406
00:34:38,903 --> 00:34:43,690
<i>You shall never find a love
that's quite the same...</i>

407
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:49,050
<i>like the beautiful blue
waters of the sea...</i>

408
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:55,559
<i>I shall build you a little house
of coral frame...</i>

409
00:34:57,786 --> 00:35:00,649
<i>wherein dwellers shall be us...</i>

410
00:35:02,632 --> 00:35:06,840
<i>...and ecstasy.</i>

411
00:35:18,194 --> 00:35:19,629
No way, Polydoros!

412
00:35:20,062 --> 00:35:22,882
I'm not giving my daughter
to the fisherman.

413
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:26,487
You're wrong, Panagiotis. Fotis will
be a good family man.

414
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:29,091
I have different plans for my daughter.

415
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:33,333
Yeah, make sure you give her to some
Athenian dandy who'll give you...

416
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:34,618
Six one!

417
00:35:38,122 --> 00:35:39,257
Oh, welcome!

418
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,586
A telegram, Mr. President.

419
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,472
<i>Hand it in, my child!</i>

420
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:46,359
Here it is!

421
00:35:50,775 --> 00:35:53,295
It must be from our MP,
Mr. Bribecome.

422
00:35:53,595 --> 00:35:55,732
And what does he say, best man?

423
00:35:55,852 --> 00:35:59,223
Taking action for a female teacher's
definite appointment

424
00:35:59,343 --> 00:36:01,979
Yours wholly,
MP Epameinondas Bribecome.

425
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,398
<i>Praised be God!</i>

426
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:24,101
Leave it there, dear!
Leave it there!

427
00:36:40,294 --> 00:36:42,013
A telegram, Mr. Bandage!

428
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:44,667
Leave it there, dear! Leave it there!

429
00:36:57,071 --> 00:36:58,155
From our MP!

430
00:36:59,377 --> 00:37:01,930
Let's see! Shall we
outfox the President?

431
00:37:03,015 --> 00:37:04,517
What did you think?

432
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:06,753
Would we let him do as he liked?

433
00:37:07,171 --> 00:37:08,990
We'll get our way in this!

434
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,983
Trying to satisfy your need STOP

435
00:37:14,734 --> 00:37:17,204
Facing Ministry's reaction STOP

436
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:22,142
Continuing efforts for male teacher's
return STOP

437
00:37:23,127 --> 00:37:25,547
Keep present notice secret

438
00:37:26,097 --> 00:37:29,124
Yours wholly,
Epam. Bribecome, MP

439
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,227
Hail to Bribecome!

440
00:37:31,347 --> 00:37:33,046
He'll manage perfectly!

441
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:40,534
So I told the assistant since I can't
go, send my sister who's also a teacher.

442
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:42,570
Is this the truth or a joke?

443
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:45,792
Joke? But I've also got your
appointment documents.

444
00:37:45,912 --> 00:37:49,370
Really? How nice, me being appointed
after all these years!

445
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:50,271
Here.

446
00:37:50,391 --> 00:37:54,460
Teacher Evangelia Papadaki, widow
Sourotitis, appointed to the gymansium

447
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,603
for female students at the county
of Kondoskali.

448
00:37:57,723 --> 00:37:59,823
Oh my brother, let me kiss you!

449
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:02,949
- You'll have a good time there!
- I'll leave at once!

450
00:38:03,069 --> 00:38:06,971
Not yet. I have a plan to snatch
Bilio, the President's daughter.

451
00:38:07,091 --> 00:38:09,274
From her dowry you'll get a share.

452
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:11,814
- But...
- No buts. I'll tell you when!

453
00:38:11,934 --> 00:38:13,433
I have my own ploy!

454
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:25,418
Now, when will this female teacher
come along and let us see her?

455
00:38:26,986 --> 00:38:28,705
Well, if she's pretty...

456
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:32,160
we might even get something
out of it, Polydoros!

457
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,257
But is the MP sending us one?

458
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:37,695
<i>How dare he not send her? He won't
be reelected, then!</i>

459
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:40,266
Mind you, he knows better than that!

460
00:38:40,386 --> 00:38:41,681
Postman's here!

461
00:38:41,801 --> 00:38:43,100
Welcome, Babis!

462
00:38:44,685 --> 00:38:46,488
A telegram, Mr. President!

463
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:48,474
<i>Hand it in then, Babis!</i>

464
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,346
<i>Eeeh, poor Babis!</i>

465
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,683
<i>You've grown too old for it.</i>

466
00:38:53,803 --> 00:38:56,036
- Here it is!
- It's from our MP!

467
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:58,006
Speaking of the devil...

468
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:04,248
Evangelia Sourotiris, teacher,
appointed STOP

469
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:06,284
On my way to Makrohori

470
00:39:06,652 --> 00:39:08,204
passing by Kondoskali

471
00:39:08,588 --> 00:39:10,540
tomorrow Thursday afternoon

472
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:13,870
Yours wholly, Epameidondas
Bribecome

473
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:15,990
- That's today!
- Yes.

474
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,626
We must welcome him!

475
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:24,695
Yes, in the afternoon! We have to
organize our reception.

476
00:39:24,815 --> 00:39:26,515
Of course, by all means!

477
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:30,086
Gerasimos, you go raise the flag
at the Municipality Office

478
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:33,125
and notify the Philarmonic.
- At once, President!

479
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,758
You bring my shoes.

480
00:39:34,878 --> 00:39:37,512
- We have to rush now!
- Sure we have!

481
00:39:44,931 --> 00:39:46,683
Give me a hand, Polydoros!

482
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:54,728
How did this happen, help me Kolias!

483
00:39:57,447 --> 00:39:59,733
He chose the right time for a bath!

484
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,773
Oh, Ms. Headmistress, we've got news!

485
00:40:05,128 --> 00:40:07,098
A new teacher's been appointed.

486
00:40:07,218 --> 00:40:10,085
<i>I'm aware of it, I just received
this telegram.</i>

487
00:40:11,404 --> 00:40:14,675
Headmistress of one-class
semi-Gymmasium of Kondoskali

488
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:17,381
I was appointed as teacher
to your school

489
00:40:17,501 --> 00:40:20,202
arriving on Thursday
Evangelia Sourotiris.

490
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:24,129
<i>Good! Along with the MP.
Then the schoolgirls must all be there.</i>

491
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:26,032
Very well, Mr. President.

492
00:40:26,152 --> 00:40:29,104
<i>- Let the school janitor come, too!</i>
- Of course!

493
00:40:29,224 --> 00:40:30,389
Yeah...yeah...

494
00:40:30,509 --> 00:40:33,574
<i>- You put on your nicest clothes!</i>
- Yeah...yeah...

495
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:36,345
Shall we call the Opposition party too?

496
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:39,049
- The pharmacist?
- Yes, what do you say?

497
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:41,519
Let's call them and spit in their eye!

498
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:45,474
Right! Then you go notify the pharmacist
and all his dog company.

499
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:49,312
And you, idiot, go pick some flowers
for the new teacher!

500
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:51,215
Why? Is this the Epitaph?

501
00:40:51,335 --> 00:40:52,924
<i>They do so in Athens!</i>

502
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:55,962
- Shall I make some koliva, too?
<i>- Koliva, why?</i>

503
00:40:56,082 --> 00:40:58,032
For the old teacher's funeral.

504
00:41:00,134 --> 00:41:01,420
VEHICLE STATION

505
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,726
Oh, our dear MP!

506
00:41:19,277 --> 00:41:20,612
Hello, Thymios!

507
00:41:20,732 --> 00:41:22,331
How are you, Thymios?

508
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:25,280
I'm not Thymios, boss!
You forgot me already?

509
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,145
I'm Dimitros Bardousis.

510
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:28,980
Right you are!

511
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,741
Just when I was thinking you looked
like Dimitros Bardousis!

512
00:41:33,292 --> 00:41:35,695
Of course I look like him,
I am him!

513
00:41:38,592 --> 00:41:40,662
Off to Kondoskali, our village?

514
00:41:41,696 --> 00:41:45,485
I'm going to Makrohori, but I'll also
greet people in Kondoskali.

515
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:47,822
I'm so glad to have seen you, MP!

516
00:41:48,666 --> 00:41:51,403
- You've also made me a promise!
- Have I?

517
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:53,423
Oh, yes! Please remind me...

518
00:41:53,823 --> 00:41:55,092
About my child.

519
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,093
My son.

520
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,795
<i>Of course, how is he?</i>

521
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,923
Still waiting for a position, you had
promised to get him one, boss.

522
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:05,845
But of course I will. You have any
particular ones in mind?

523
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:10,088
<i>Why not make him the Prime Minister's
attaché who travels abroad often?</i>

524
00:42:10,388 --> 00:42:12,975
But does he speak any
foreign languages?

525
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:16,198
Sure he does! Speaks
perfect Arvanitic!

526
00:42:16,515 --> 00:42:18,235
<i>That's of no use at all!</i>

527
00:42:18,535 --> 00:42:20,054
Appoint him first...

528
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,742
then you can get an interpreter
to help the boy out.

529
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,833
Well, I'll look into it.
We'll see about it.

530
00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:42,557
<i>Passengers for Kondoskali, Makrohori
are now called!</i>

531
00:42:59,229 --> 00:43:00,064
May I?

532
00:43:14,982 --> 00:43:16,534
Going to Kondoskali?

533
00:43:16,654 --> 00:43:17,402
No!

534
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:19,405
I'm going to Kondoskali!

535
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:22,398
Aaah and I thought you were
off to Kondoskali.

536
00:43:33,908 --> 00:43:36,545
- Perhaps you're in a draft, Miss?
- No!

537
00:43:38,063 --> 00:43:39,415
It that so, then?

538
00:43:40,063 --> 00:43:44,135
Mr. President ordered that the
Municipality Building be painted white?

539
00:43:44,436 --> 00:43:46,939
<i>Well, that's not a big issue, anyway!</i>

540
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,107
Not big?!

541
00:43:48,227 --> 00:43:50,744
Leave it there, child!
Leave it there!

542
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:52,361
It's more than big!

543
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:55,893
We, the opposition, should also
have been asked about it.

544
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,735
We want it painted blue!

545
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:02,624
You've gone too far already.

546
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:05,311
The President says white,
you say black.

547
00:44:05,431 --> 00:44:07,798
You say day, the President says night.

548
00:44:09,432 --> 00:44:10,717
Good morning...

549
00:44:14,506 --> 00:44:18,161
Mr. President is proudly inviting you
to the reception ceremony

550
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:20,160
for our passing-by MP

551
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:24,866
as well as the new female teacher of
our community of Kondoskali

552
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:27,136
who is arriving shortly.

553
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,152
I'll have a party council

554
00:44:30,272 --> 00:44:34,324
on whether we should participate in
this disgusting affair or not!

555
00:44:37,529 --> 00:44:39,598
Our Member of the Parliament...

556
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,747
Mind you, he's in for some fun
that scoundrel...

557
00:44:42,867 --> 00:44:44,149
Of course he is.

558
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:46,435
We'll take care of him!

559
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:51,745
COUNTY OF KONDOSKALI OFFICES

560
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:31,122
HAIL TO OUR MP

561
00:46:22,277 --> 00:46:23,529
IT'S YOU WE WANT

562
00:46:32,685 --> 00:46:33,594
TURPS

563
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:49,666
LONG LIVE OUR MP

564
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:04,187
MAKE WAY FOR OUR PRECIOUS ONE

565
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:27,201
<i>Turn to your left!</i>

566
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:43,929
Good morning all!

567
00:47:46,633 --> 00:47:48,085
<i>Morning, girls!</i>

568
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:51,941
Ms. Headmistress, how do you do?

569
00:48:25,489 --> 00:48:26,874
Hail to our MP!

570
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:30,743
STAND BACK CITIZENS
MAKE WAY FOR OUR PRECIOUS ONE

571
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:32,866
And hail once more!

572
00:48:40,798 --> 00:48:43,618
Good morning to you, Sir, welcome!

573
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:48,942
Let's hail him once more!

574
00:48:56,363 --> 00:48:57,915
Men of Kondoskali!

575
00:48:59,885 --> 00:49:02,872
This cordial reception you
prepared for me

576
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,376
filled me with bliss and joy!

577
00:49:06,857 --> 00:49:10,008
<i>I never will forget this forunate day</i>
(JUST ARRIVED...)

578
00:49:10,128 --> 00:49:12,531
<i>during which the noble inhabitants</i>

579
00:49:12,651 --> 00:49:15,576
<i>of glorious village Kondostali</i>
(...THE NEW LAXATIVE...)

580
00:49:15,696 --> 00:49:17,378
<i>have received their proxy</i>

581
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:19,837
<i>with such enthusiasm!</i>
(...FLUXATOL)

582
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,492
Believe me when I say that
Kondoskali will very soon

583
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:25,562
stop being a village!

584
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:27,164
<i>Cut it out!</i>

585
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:34,030
<i>Because soon projects of electricity
expansion are about to begin</i>

586
00:49:34,414 --> 00:49:37,485
<i>as well as water supply and road
construction ones</i>

587
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:40,222
<i>offering work positions
to the population</i>

588
00:49:40,342 --> 00:49:43,459
<i>and soon turning Kondoskali
into a Paris miniature!</i>

589
00:49:47,799 --> 00:49:49,531
<i>Sell these elsewhere!</i>

590
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:53,691
I will build hospitals

591
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,844
hotels for tourists

592
00:49:56,953 --> 00:49:58,538
and two theatre houses!

593
00:49:59,556 --> 00:50:04,430
<i>And these will be done in the following
days or months or, at the most, years...</i>

594
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,453
<i>Just wait for a short while</i>

595
00:50:07,573 --> 00:50:10,240
<i>because if you don't wait for
a short while</i>

596
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,258
<i>then...</i>

597
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,811
you'll have to wait for too long!

598
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:24,235
Each request of yours is
immediately met!

599
00:50:25,464 --> 00:50:28,736
You requested that I appointed
a female teacher for you

600
00:50:28,856 --> 00:50:32,374
I directly took action and her
appointment has been signed!

601
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:35,662
<i>Shortly she will be arriving
at her post.</i>

602
00:50:36,211 --> 00:50:38,748
But I'm already here.
I'm the teacher!

603
00:50:41,602 --> 00:50:43,772
What did I tell you?
She's here!

604
00:50:43,892 --> 00:50:46,208
This is your village's new teacher!

605
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:58,055
Call out hurrah!
All together now!

606
00:51:39,817 --> 00:51:41,753
Welcome! Your name, please?

607
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:44,390
Evangelia Papadakis,
widow Sourotiris.

608
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,992
Absolutely charmed!

609
00:51:53,231 --> 00:51:55,851
We welcome you to
our village Kondoskali

610
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,816
<i>from which so many male and
female teachers have passed.</i>

611
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:03,481
<i>We trust our student daughters with you</i>

612
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:06,696
<i>certain that you'll instruct them
with patriotism.</i>

613
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,312
This is Ms. Headmistress.

614
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,171
This is my daughter.

615
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:17,589
What's wrong?

616
00:52:17,709 --> 00:52:20,426
I don't know, excuse me...
I'm dizzy.

617
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:22,546
Perhaps due to the heat...

618
00:52:22,666 --> 00:52:23,847
or the bus...

619
00:52:24,248 --> 00:52:25,667
Perhaps you're ...

620
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:28,394
Nooo, that's quite impossible!

621
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:31,265
I've been a widow for three years now.

622
00:52:31,385 --> 00:52:34,670
You must rest. I will accomodate you
at my house. Come!

623
00:52:48,887 --> 00:52:50,088
All right now?

624
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,791
Are you feeling well?

625
00:52:51,911 --> 00:52:53,209
Absolutely well?

626
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:54,444
Good! Good!

627
00:52:56,325 --> 00:53:00,014
I hope that you and my daughter
will have a nice time together.

628
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:03,318
- But that's what I came for!
- What you came for...?

629
00:53:03,986 --> 00:53:05,254
Well, I mean...

630
00:53:05,657 --> 00:53:08,010
I want to be a friend for my students

631
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,646
not just a teacher.

632
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,799
Then, I'll love you very much!

633
00:53:11,919 --> 00:53:13,651
I'll love you even more!

634
00:53:15,142 --> 00:53:17,963
Bilio, you may show the lady
to her room now.

635
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,215
<i>Yes, father.</i>

636
00:53:19,335 --> 00:53:23,120
And why are you standing there
like a log? Carry the suitcase in!

637
00:53:23,487 --> 00:53:24,605
Yeah... yes!

638
00:53:34,467 --> 00:53:36,820
- This is your room.
- Thanks, Bilio.

639
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:40,809
I'll leave you to freshen up a little
and then we'll dine together.

640
00:53:40,929 --> 00:53:41,878
Thanks!

641
00:53:45,493 --> 00:53:48,897
- Leave the suitcase, don't tire
yourself out! - Yeah...

642
00:53:52,018 --> 00:53:53,988
- What's your name?
- Yeah...

643
00:53:54,108 --> 00:53:56,653
- That's your name?
- No, it's Manolis.

644
00:54:03,787 --> 00:54:06,833
- This village is really hot, Manolis!
- Yeaaah...

645
00:54:06,953 --> 00:54:08,752
Please help me undress...

646
00:54:08,872 --> 00:54:09,829
Undress??

647
00:54:09,949 --> 00:54:10,839
Oh yes!

648
00:54:11,378 --> 00:54:15,064
I'm about to burst with this heat.
Unzip me back there please...

649
00:54:15,184 --> 00:54:17,538
- Yeah, back there?
- Yes, unzip me.

650
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:19,827
Yeah, too hot, yeah...

651
00:54:19,947 --> 00:54:21,123
Indeed it is!

652
00:54:25,776 --> 00:54:27,409
Come on, help me out!

653
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,499
Heat, too much heat!

654
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:34,640
What's all that, fathead?

655
00:54:35,381 --> 00:54:36,155
Yeaah.

656
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:38,579
Don't "yeaah" me, stupid!
It's me!

657
00:54:38,699 --> 00:54:39,975
It's me, Plato!

658
00:54:40,817 --> 00:54:42,062
Mister Plato!

659
00:54:43,467 --> 00:54:44,763
Are you a ghost?

660
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,315
It's me, your friend the Teacher!

661
00:54:48,435 --> 00:54:49,964
You became a woman?

662
00:54:50,084 --> 00:54:51,445
Did anyone notice?

663
00:54:51,565 --> 00:54:53,044
No one, Sir Teacher!

664
00:54:54,422 --> 00:54:56,173
Listen, Manolis... I'll...

665
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:00,750
What's the teacher doing with Manolis
I wonder.

666
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,955
Probably tidying up her things.

667
00:55:03,931 --> 00:55:05,934
So, you two will elope, right?

668
00:55:06,237 --> 00:55:08,038
I cannot live without her.

669
00:55:08,158 --> 00:55:09,485
So hear me out.

670
00:55:09,827 --> 00:55:11,678
You and Panagos the chauffer

671
00:55:11,798 --> 00:55:15,549
will both be at the wooden bench
in the woods when I tell you to.

672
00:55:15,669 --> 00:55:18,444
I'll ask Bilio to walk with me
to that spot.

673
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:21,559
I'll put her in the car
and that'll be all.

674
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,548
- And what am I supposed to say?
- That you know nothing about it.

675
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:29,840
And when I get her dowry, one of the
President's vineyards will be yours.

676
00:55:30,664 --> 00:55:31,607
Agreed?

677
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,846
So then, Mdm. Schoolmistress

678
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,883
welcome to our village!

679
00:55:38,003 --> 00:55:40,576
- Thank you!
- What did you think of it?

680
00:55:40,696 --> 00:55:41,737
Very nice!

681
00:55:41,857 --> 00:55:44,518
That where the sea is
and there's the woods.

682
00:55:44,638 --> 00:55:46,504
Really? Shall we walk there?

683
00:55:46,624 --> 00:55:48,103
Of course, Bilio...

684
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,493
Tomorrow afternoon when it's cooler

685
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,640
take Mdm. Teacher for a walk to
the wooden bench.

686
00:55:55,184 --> 00:55:56,917
You have a wooden bench?

687
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:58,533
Yes, up on the hill.

688
00:55:58,653 --> 00:56:00,653
The view is marvellous there.

689
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:04,659
- Shall we go there tomorrow then?
- Of course, if you want us to.

690
00:56:06,511 --> 00:56:09,086
Tell us, Bilio. Does she
seem to be good?

691
00:56:09,206 --> 00:56:13,799
Dunno, girls. I only saw her last night.
The Headmistress took her this morning.

692
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:16,273
Girls, we must break her immediately!

693
00:56:16,393 --> 00:56:17,855
Yes, mockery, yes!

694
00:56:31,959 --> 00:56:34,567
I've brought you your new
schoolmistress!

695
00:56:35,188 --> 00:56:38,453
I hope you'll present her with your
obedience, as well as

696
00:56:38,573 --> 00:56:40,288
neatness and diligence.

697
00:56:54,135 --> 00:56:57,720
Youthfulness is but a flower
and the fruit thereof is eros

698
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:01,742
Hapless he who lastly reaps it
It's the greatest of errors

699
00:57:06,539 --> 00:57:07,515
Con-

700
00:57:08,154 --> 00:57:09,164
-duct...

701
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:11,436
Zero!

702
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:15,090
Madam!

703
00:57:15,494 --> 00:57:18,288
There's some paper stuck on you
at your back.

704
00:57:18,408 --> 00:57:19,230
Paper?

705
00:57:19,350 --> 00:57:21,351
Allow me, Ms. Headmistress...

706
00:57:22,007 --> 00:57:23,269
Now, hold it...

707
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,053
I'd surely like to know

708
00:57:25,173 --> 00:57:27,982
which one of you left this paper
on the table!

709
00:57:52,934 --> 00:57:57,141
I'm sure that distrait Manolis forgot
the paper on the teacher's table.

710
00:57:57,814 --> 00:57:59,884
Oh my hands are all sticky now!

711
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:03,826
My handkerchief...
Where's my handkerchief?

712
00:58:41,611 --> 00:58:42,772
We're saved!

713
00:58:43,310 --> 00:58:47,131
Getting on with this class is
impossible! I'm much too upset!

714
00:58:47,484 --> 00:58:48,864
Me too! Me too!

715
00:58:49,596 --> 00:58:52,541
So are we, Ms. Headmistress!
So are we!

716
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:56,141
<i>Today being a Saturday
you might as well be dismissed.</i>

717
00:58:56,261 --> 00:59:00,381
Tomorrow, after church, we'll all
proceed to the beach for sea bathing!

718
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:01,813
Hooray!

719
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:08,086
Most certainly you'll come too,
Mrs. Evangelia.

720
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,048
Me? Sea bathing?
Well... you know...

721
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:12,530
Oh, I see...

722
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:14,480
It's all right then,

723
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,005
you'll only be there for sun bathing.

724
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:23,320
How come? Dismissed already, Bilio?

725
00:59:25,634 --> 00:59:27,687
Yes, we finished earlier today.

726
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,546
The new teacher?

727
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:33,801
The Headmistress left with her.

728
00:59:33,921 --> 00:59:37,790
Did you tell the Headmistress we're
having her for dinner tonight?

729
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:41,369
Oh yes, she'll be here. She's very
happy we've invited her.

730
00:59:41,489 --> 00:59:45,139
And the teacher? Does she look content?
She told you anything?

731
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:49,161
We haven't spoken since last night.
We'll walk in the woods this afternoon.

732
00:59:49,281 --> 00:59:51,463
Up to the wooden bench.
- You will?

733
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:55,126
- What time? Perhaps I could join you?
- We're leaving at 6.

734
00:59:55,246 --> 00:59:58,778
<i>Pity! I have a municipality meeting.
Some other time then.</i>

735
00:59:59,656 --> 01:00:01,524
Aah, what a nice lobster!

736
01:00:02,921 --> 01:00:05,664
That's your order to Mr. Fotis,
President.

737
01:00:05,784 --> 01:00:09,315
- How much does it weigh?
- 2.100. You'll settle this with him.

738
01:00:09,435 --> 01:00:11,859
- Here's a tip for you.
- Thank you!

739
01:00:22,081 --> 01:00:25,481
Today at 4 I'll be waiting
by the pine tree. Fotis.

740
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:41,324
I managed to get away. Said I
was off to a school friend of mine.

741
01:00:41,444 --> 01:00:42,620
Darling girl!

742
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,912
But I have to go back soon. I'll walk
to the bench with the new teacher.

743
01:00:47,032 --> 01:00:51,127
We got rid of the male teacher and now
we got ourselves a new trouble...

744
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:53,329
Won't you ever stop complaining?

745
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,917
Instead of cherishing the few moments
we spend together...

746
01:00:57,037 --> 01:01:00,762
Quite right, Bilio. But you see
I want you by me at all times.

747
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:53,801
Fortune teller!

748
01:01:56,461 --> 01:01:58,430
I'm a fortune teller, master.

749
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:01,627
Let me tell you all about your fate
in the future.

750
01:02:01,747 --> 01:02:05,851
I know already. You'll tell me again
the things you said the other day.

751
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:08,376
There'll be new things to tell, today.

752
01:02:08,963 --> 01:02:11,841
<i>Vai-vai, I see some bad shade
in your eyes...</i>

753
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,675
A bad one? Go on, then!

754
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:16,587
Hand me some silver, first.

755
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:22,014
Give us a smoke, too and I'll tell you
about the dark-eyed girl.

756
01:02:22,134 --> 01:02:23,629
<i>Okay, there you go.</i>

757
01:02:23,749 --> 01:02:25,634
<i>Now tell us the rest of it.</i>

758
01:02:29,051 --> 01:02:32,265
Alas, there's a storm in store
for you, my boy!

759
01:02:34,066 --> 01:02:37,180
Keep your eyes peeled on
the beauty that you love.

760
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:41,650
- What is she talking about?
<i>- Sea is all around you, the sea!</i>

761
01:02:41,770 --> 01:02:46,312
Quite right. I own a boat, so it's in
the sea of course, couldn't be uphill...

762
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,872
It's no laughing matter. I see
a person in the sea...

763
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:53,639
Watch out, young man!

764
01:02:53,992 --> 01:02:56,281
There. Take this too and farewell.

765
01:02:56,599 --> 01:02:59,494
Thank you. Wishing you the best
for your life.

766
01:02:59,614 --> 01:03:02,085
May the soil you touch
turn into gold.

767
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:03,752
The fortune teller!

768
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:09,457
God, I'm so late! The teacher will
be waiting for me!

769
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:10,753
Listen, Bilio.

770
01:03:11,376 --> 01:03:13,648
I'll be here in the woods, waiting.

771
01:03:13,768 --> 01:03:17,807
- When you and the teacher get here,
I'll join you. - But should you?

772
01:03:17,927 --> 01:03:21,695
It'll look like a chance meeting.
So I'll spend more time by you!

773
01:03:21,815 --> 01:03:23,428
Fine. Do as you like.

774
01:03:23,548 --> 01:03:24,438
Bye now.

775
01:03:32,876 --> 01:03:36,292
Anyway, Manolis, won't you tell me
what we came here for?

776
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,992
- Yeaah!
- Say it, then!

777
01:03:38,112 --> 01:03:41,207
Why do you care? You'll see.
Don't you want a fare?

778
01:03:41,327 --> 01:03:43,597
- Of course. Where to?
- To Athens.

779
01:03:43,717 --> 01:03:45,603
You don't say! A good fare!

780
01:03:48,464 --> 01:03:50,399
So this is the wooden bench?

781
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:52,789
- Yes. Do you like it?
- Very nice!

782
01:03:59,177 --> 01:04:02,677
Won't you tell me then?
Who's the lucky man that you love?

783
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,806
I can't do that. We're not
really acquainted yet.

784
01:04:05,926 --> 01:04:07,893
Fine, my girl. I won't insist.

785
01:04:08,013 --> 01:04:11,360
You know, Bilio, my brother really
liked you very much!

786
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,551
Mr. Plato? I know he loved me but I
didn't really like that beard of his!

787
01:04:15,671 --> 01:04:18,363
Why didn't you tell him
to shave it, then?

788
01:04:18,483 --> 01:04:21,560
I'm certain that now back in Athens
when I saw him

789
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,304
he said he was about to shave it.

790
01:04:24,424 --> 01:04:28,578
In fact, I could bet on it, now as
I'm talking to you he's quite shaven.

791
01:04:29,437 --> 01:04:32,270
Oh, that poor man! What else
did he tell you?

792
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:35,199
<i>He said he was about to come
and snatch you!</i>

793
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:37,218
- Snatch me?
<i>- Yes. He said</i>

794
01:04:37,338 --> 01:04:40,433
<i>I'll snatch her, take her to Athens
and marry her.</i>

795
01:04:40,553 --> 01:04:42,082
He really said that?

796
01:04:43,715 --> 01:04:46,021
He said it and he's saying it again.

797
01:04:46,963 --> 01:04:48,831
What would you do if he did?

798
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,430
Good evening to you!

799
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:52,408
- Who is this?
- Fotis.

800
01:04:52,528 --> 01:04:53,839
Taking a stroll?

801
01:04:53,959 --> 01:04:56,043
You like our woods, Mdm. Teacher?

802
01:04:56,163 --> 01:04:58,618
At moments I do, other moments I don't!

803
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,221
Bilio, perhaps Mr.President may get
angry with young men following us?

804
01:05:04,341 --> 01:05:07,637
How will he know? I can't believe
you'd ever tell him.

805
01:05:09,032 --> 01:05:11,052
And what do you do, Mr. Fotis?

806
01:05:11,172 --> 01:05:13,256
<i>I have trawlers. I catch fish.</i>

807
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:14,990
I often do so myself. I like...

808
01:05:15,484 --> 01:05:17,066
...black seabreams...

809
01:05:17,186 --> 01:05:18,379
<i>Do you really?</i>

810
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:20,550
I caught many of them today.

811
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:24,253
<i>Then could you please run and get me
half an oka? Go on! Now!</i>

812
01:05:24,373 --> 01:05:26,222
Sold'em out since morning.

813
01:05:26,342 --> 01:05:27,753
<i>Mmm, all of them?</i>

814
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,056
Quickly, Panagos, start the car!

815
01:05:43,176 --> 01:05:46,170
- Mission postponed.
- You brought me here for nothing?

816
01:05:46,290 --> 01:05:48,728
- Yeah. - Yeah?
- No. -Then pay me off.

817
01:05:48,848 --> 01:05:51,589
- At the end of the month.
- Get lost, wretch!

818
01:05:51,709 --> 01:05:53,306
Why punch me, Panagos?

819
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,107
<i>Panagos, hold it!</i>

820
01:05:56,908 --> 01:05:58,305
<i>Hold it, Panagos!</i>

821
01:05:59,328 --> 01:06:00,826
<i>Panagos, hold it...</i>

822
01:06:02,727 --> 01:06:04,495
<i>Hold it... Panagos...</i>

823
01:06:07,026 --> 01:06:09,096
Here's to Mdm. Teacher's health!

824
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:10,106
Again?

825
01:06:10,226 --> 01:06:12,731
We've had too much
wine, Mr. President!

826
01:06:12,851 --> 01:06:14,280
It's the last one.

827
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,444
Well, now if you'll excuse me,
it is rather late.

828
01:06:17,564 --> 01:06:20,912
- Goodnight to all.
- Goodnight, please come again soon!

829
01:06:25,355 --> 01:06:27,797
One more glass of wine, Mdm. Teacher?

830
01:06:37,372 --> 01:06:39,661
Bilio, my child, you may go to bed.

831
01:06:39,981 --> 01:06:41,967
I will have a chat with Madam.

832
01:06:42,087 --> 01:06:43,044
Yes, Dad.

833
01:06:44,188 --> 01:06:46,073
- Good night!
- Good night.

834
01:06:47,544 --> 01:06:48,940
Good night, Bilio!

835
01:06:52,727 --> 01:06:54,595
So, you're a widow too, eh?

836
01:06:54,715 --> 01:06:56,918
Me also a widower, for 12 years.

837
01:06:58,096 --> 01:06:59,913
Loneliness is a bad thing.

838
01:07:01,176 --> 01:07:03,549
And what do you think of our village?

839
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:06,493
Very nice! I wish I could stay
here forever.

840
01:07:06,613 --> 01:07:08,239
That's not impossible.

841
01:07:08,359 --> 01:07:10,898
But I'll be transferred some time soon.

842
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:14,942
Who says you will? We have our MP who
does whatever we wish him to!

843
01:07:15,579 --> 01:07:18,659
But it may happen that even he
won't manage to do so.

844
01:07:18,779 --> 01:07:21,486
If the Minister comes from
another party...

845
01:07:21,606 --> 01:07:25,340
So what? If you happen to be
transferred you'll just stay here.

846
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:26,365
Bravely!

847
01:07:26,635 --> 01:07:29,428
Also you will resign yourself
from teaching.

848
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:32,155
Mr. President, what will I
live on, then?

849
01:07:32,275 --> 01:07:33,804
I'm here for you...

850
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:45,870
I'm here, I said.

851
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:48,505
You are? And what do you
mean by that?

852
01:07:48,625 --> 01:07:52,612
I am a widower. Soon my daughter will
get married, so I'll marry you.

853
01:07:53,032 --> 01:07:53,739
Me?

854
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:57,257
Can you think of a better luck for you?

855
01:07:57,377 --> 01:08:01,048
I'm the first man of the village.
I'll make a queen out of you!

856
01:08:01,168 --> 01:08:02,798
Then, will you accept?

857
01:08:02,918 --> 01:08:05,036
I'm really touched, Mr. President

858
01:08:05,156 --> 01:08:07,864
as well as tired, that journey,
you see...

859
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:09,583
Let me think about it!

860
01:08:09,703 --> 01:08:11,114
Think, of course!

861
01:08:11,653 --> 01:08:13,319
We have plenty of time!

862
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:16,750
- Good night, Mr. President.
- Good night, my dearest!

863
01:08:33,252 --> 01:08:34,110
Come in!

864
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,272
What's your name?

865
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:52,248
Tasso.

866
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,368
That's a sweet name!

867
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:01,812
Don't be afraid! I'm coming
to fasten the bolt.

868
01:09:01,932 --> 01:09:02,973
The bolt!

869
01:09:36,878 --> 01:09:38,561
<i>Widow, you better...</i>

870
01:09:39,302 --> 01:09:41,086
<i>...change your surname...</i>

871
01:09:43,270 --> 01:09:44,717
<i>...So they won't call you...</i>

872
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:48,268
<i>...widow...</i>

873
01:09:58,018 --> 01:10:01,300
<i>You've scorched me
oh neighbourhood woman...</i>

874
01:10:01,873 --> 01:10:03,421
<i>...you wretched...</i>

875
01:10:04,139 --> 01:10:05,889
<i>...murderess...</i>

876
01:10:19,254 --> 01:10:20,702
Who... Who is it?

877
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:25,280
It's me, Mr. Plato, Mrs. Evangelia,
it's Manolis.

878
01:10:29,015 --> 01:10:30,816
You startled me, silly...

879
01:10:31,672 --> 01:10:33,069
Well, Mr. Plato...

880
01:10:33,557 --> 01:10:35,930
you look exactly like Beauty herself!

881
01:10:36,923 --> 01:10:38,688
Shut up! Why are you here?

882
01:10:39,244 --> 01:10:43,535
<i>The Headmistress sent me. They awaited
you for the beach trip but they left.</i>

883
01:10:43,655 --> 01:10:46,582
Already? We must hurry up.
Sit here and listen!

884
01:10:46,702 --> 01:10:48,315
Yesterday we blew it.

885
01:10:48,435 --> 01:10:51,042
When I saw Fotis
I had such a fright!

886
01:10:52,624 --> 01:10:56,091
What's done is done. That's over.
We must do better today.

887
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:58,784
- All over again?
- Be silent and listen!

888
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:00,887
You'll take my suitcase and...

889
01:11:19,623 --> 01:11:22,139
<i>Bring them over
as quickly as possible!</i>

890
01:11:24,131 --> 01:11:25,511
Drown happily!

891
01:12:29,347 --> 01:12:30,255
Bilio!

892
01:12:57,802 --> 01:13:00,402
Come on, Manolis, you're
far too clumsy!

893
01:13:00,796 --> 01:13:01,688
Yeah...

894
01:13:01,991 --> 01:13:05,256
Try playing sailor and
you'll plundge down like lead...

895
01:13:20,036 --> 01:13:22,830
Look at Bilio! She's swimming
too far again!

896
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:26,029
And she'll stay one mile away,
as she always does.

897
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,087
Biliooo!

898
01:13:45,356 --> 01:13:46,954
Don't swim that far!

899
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:15,954
A diligent boy this Fotis, best man!

900
01:14:16,074 --> 01:14:19,774
He even works on a Sunday!
Good for the girl who'll marry him.

901
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:24,083
The one he considers marrying
won't be his, anyway.

902
01:14:25,276 --> 01:14:27,245
<i>Biliooo, come back here!</i>

903
01:14:27,919 --> 01:14:29,787
Yeees, I will...

904
01:14:40,262 --> 01:14:41,171
Bilio!

905
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,618
Bilio.

906
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,621
You, Mrs. Evangelia?

907
01:14:47,044 --> 01:14:49,299
You came that far?
Aren't you tired?

908
01:14:49,419 --> 01:14:51,941
- I am, a little.
- Come aboard, then.

909
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:02,937
Sit, Bilio.

910
01:15:03,946 --> 01:15:08,491
I saw you swimming so far in and took
the boat 'cause I was worried about you.

911
01:15:08,611 --> 01:15:12,267
- You really love me that much?
- Yes, Bilio! I do! I love you!

912
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:15,970
- I'm not who you think I am!
- You're not? What do you mean?

913
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:18,781
I mean that... Remember
my brother, Plato?

914
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:20,857
Our teacher? How could I not?

915
01:15:20,977 --> 01:15:24,274
He loved you very much, Bilio!
He wanted to snatch you.

916
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:27,084
Snatch me?
Ah, you told me yesterday, too.

917
01:15:27,204 --> 01:15:28,902
Yes, make you his wife.

918
01:15:29,392 --> 01:15:30,503
And since...

919
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:34,828
he couldn't come back to the village
he was forced to... - To what?

920
01:15:34,948 --> 01:15:36,225
It is me, Bilio!

921
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:38,363
What?

922
01:15:46,331 --> 01:15:49,613
Yes, it's me Bilio!
There's a motorboat waiting for us.

923
01:15:49,733 --> 01:15:53,905
- Nothing can keep us apart now!
- Don't you touch me, you're disgusting!

924
01:15:56,631 --> 01:15:57,456
Help!

925
01:15:58,163 --> 01:15:58,971
Help!

926
01:16:26,609 --> 01:16:28,494
Help! They're drowning!

927
01:16:29,184 --> 01:16:30,901
<i>Bilio's drowning!</i>

928
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:36,553
<i>Bilio's drowning!</i>

929
01:17:03,266 --> 01:17:04,680
Run for the oars!

930
01:17:25,418 --> 01:17:27,202
Oh my God, it's our Bilio!

931
01:17:27,572 --> 01:17:28,599
Our Bilio!

932
01:18:18,103 --> 01:18:20,190
Manolis, you fish this one out!

933
01:18:42,202 --> 01:18:44,575
If it hadn't been for Fotis, father...

934
01:18:45,635 --> 01:18:47,772
Didn't I tell you so, my best man?

935
01:18:47,892 --> 01:18:49,506
A diligent boy, Fotis!

936
01:18:49,626 --> 01:18:51,908
Real good for the girl he'll marry!

937
01:18:54,477 --> 01:18:56,446
Well, he's found her already!

938
01:18:59,870 --> 01:19:01,166
<i>Come here, Fotis!</i>

939
01:19:04,263 --> 01:19:07,444
You saved her, Fotis, she's yours.
You can have her!

940
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,065
Let me drown!

941
01:19:25,334 --> 01:19:26,546
Let me drown!

942
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,913
Come here, you!

943
01:19:35,185 --> 01:19:37,356
You have to account for youself.

944
01:19:37,476 --> 01:19:38,953
You'll go to prison!

945
01:19:39,073 --> 01:19:41,124
Mr. President, forgive him!

946
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:44,053
Perhaps he will show his repentance.

947
01:19:44,423 --> 01:19:46,443
For your sake, I forgive him.

948
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:47,974
But then...

949
01:19:48,457 --> 01:19:50,157
he will marry the girl!

950
01:19:50,277 --> 01:19:51,706
My little darling!

951
