1
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,496
Roberte

2
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,336
Roberte!

3
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,697
Leave me alone.

4
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,572
- Close the window.
It’s cold.

5
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,576
- You can't miss the
first migration of the year.

6
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,133
Go by yourself.

7
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,491
- A flock of ducks
before the equinox, that's rare.

8
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,455
- Oh, the equinox! For 40 years,
it’s all you ever think about.

9
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,891
- But it's you who wanted to
go hunting this morning.

10
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,330
I don't want to anymore.

11
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,248
How much is that?

12
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,779
3 shots

13
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,813
That’s not 3 shots.

14
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,614
-3, I swear.
Look again.

15
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,535
I’ll go downstairs
to prepare the rifles.

16
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,254
Hurry up.

17
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,018
Horrible Milan

18
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,455
I can't see a thing. Why
did you wake me so early?

19
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,854
- Don’t move.
Look.

20
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,413
I love that.

21
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,580
It’s like a girl undressing.

22
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,338
Milan!

23
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,656
It’s beautiful.

24
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,374
- Yes. Very beautiful.
It’s a jay.

25
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,977
But that’s not game.

26
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,374
It is. People eat them.

27
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,334
You aimed well.

28
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,417
It was flying quite high.

29
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,973
You’re a good shot.

30
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,454
It’s the male.

31
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,256
The female must be worried.

32
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,249
Look!

33
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,820
We can shoot it from
under the trees.

34
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,490
Hey!

35
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,735
No.

36
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,448
We should’ve shot the female.
It would’ve been more humane.

37
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,536
- It's true, I’m like a woman
from those realist songs.

38
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,139
Yes. A drunk!

39
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,289
One day I’ll find you, sitting on the
sidewalk with two litres of red wine.

40
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,536
That’s how I’ll end up.

41
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:56,930
What is it?

42
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,459
Do you see that tree?

43
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,531
Yeah, why?

44
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,612
- The pigeons settle in it.
- Oh let me go!

45
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,769
- They sleep on the
large branches.

46
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,335
You have to shoot
almost straight up.

47
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,370
The pigeons are in your dreams.

48
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,499
You told me...

49
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,738
You told me:
"I found a new love,..

50
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,295
".. and I’m leaving you. "

51
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,536
I begged you to stay,
but you left anyway.

52
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,335
I hate you.

53
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,935
Of course.

54
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,773
Me, for years
I dreamed..

55
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,619
.. I entered
a night club,..

56
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,970
.. and I found you there
with a man,..

57
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,090
.. and you told me:
"This is my new lover.

58
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,974
And you left
with him, laughing.

59
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:54,896
- Do you still have
that dream?

60
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,976
No.

61
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,930
Of course.

62
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,690
Hey!

63
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,655
Shit!

64
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,339
- There! You have
to know what you’re doing.

65
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,533
If you hunt ducks,
you can’t shoot pigeons.

66
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:17,938
-4 shots won’t wake every
duck in the neighbourhood.

67
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,496
- You can’t hunt with
a woman who isn’t serious.

68
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,613
You always end up
embarrassing me.

69
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,813
That pigeon was fast.

70
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,294
Of course it was.

71
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,129
- They call them "rowers"
because they row..

72
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:53,618
.. with their large wings,
silently like champions.

73
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,770
Ducks can’t row.

74
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,336
They make noise
like amateurs.

75
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,976
The pigeon passed by
like a ghost ship

76
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,455
I adore you.

77
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,975
Me too.

78
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,256
What a country! You can’t hunt
in a country if there’s no game.

79
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,576
It isn't duck season yet.

80
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,897
- so what, they shoot hares
on opening day.

81
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,739
This winter, we’ll go to the river.

82
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,410
We'll make such a massacre
that you will be disgusted

83
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,056
and with wild geese,
the most beautiful game.

84
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,613
Sure. Say,..

85
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,254
.. why don’t we go
to the casino tonight?

86
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,810
No.

87
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,172
- We should! I’m better
at roulette than at hunting.

88
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,259
- We’d lose what we spend
here in a month.

89
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,020
- We can leave a month early.
- No.

90
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,253
You’re a bastard.

91
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,089
Of course.

92
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,212
But it’s true!

93
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,051
You’re overacting!

94
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,933
Ah! You brought it along.

95
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,573
I’ve done well, haven’t I?

96
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,255
- You've had a drink, huh?
Sitting by yourself just now.

97
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,688
Just 2 swigs.

98
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,008
Shall we go on?

99
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,172
I’m tired.

100
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,296
She’s a bold one.

101
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,775
She has a tender look.

102
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,813
Well that doesn't mean anything.

103
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,699
- Hello, Madame Milan.
- Hello, Radiguette.

104
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,539
Hello.

105
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,695
So?

106
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,649
- Oh, nothing.
A thrush and a jay.

107
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,772
- We can open
a bird museum soon.

108
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,529
- You’re funny hunters.
Did you have a good time?

109
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,970
He scolds me for it.

110
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,412
- You lead a comfortable life.
You do as you please.

111
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,976
- But with Milan.
- He isn’t difficult to live with.

112
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,378
- For a foreigner, he has settled down well.
- That’s what you said.

113
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,013
How are things
with your husband?

114
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,532
- We don't have the time
to bother one other.

115
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,219
Does he chase girls?

116
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,690
- He needs a young one
from time to time.

117
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,770
How do you feel about it?

118
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,778
- When he's caught,
he's nicer to me.

119
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,130
Say, you’re clever.

120
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,895
Are you coming?

121
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,412
Radiguette will never
take us seriously.

122
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,531
She knows all about life.

123
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,855
So do I.

124
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,379
Perhaps.

125
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,855
Where were you?

126
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,939
- Le Mans, in '56.
The first time I drove for Jaguar.

127
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,813
- You say it
as if you were scared?

128
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:37,174
- It’s hard to find the right
word for the feeling.

129
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,417
Especially at the start
of the race.

130
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,532
Yet, you broke
the record that day.

131
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,337
- It’s funny,
I can’t remember it very well.

132
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,452
All I can remember is
the dress you were wearing.

133
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:58,780
A blue spot, on the left,
as I approached the straightaway.

134
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,930
The one you bought for me in Rome.

135
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,129
Yes.

136
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,855
- And while I tried it on, you made
a date with the salesgirl.

137
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,620
One of life's little pleasures.

138
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,008
- Aren't you getting a little
fed up with this small village?

139
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,738
Here or elsewhere...

140
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:29,458
- Don't mind me.
- Good evening, Madame Milan.

141
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,811
Hello everyone!

142
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,693
- How are you?
- I’m bored. It’s unbelievable.

143
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,416
- It’s not funny.
- It’s the way you said it.

144
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,848
Where is Mr. Milan?

145
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,369
- He’s working.
- He isn't bored?

146
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,855
- You'd like if he
came for you.

147
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,816
Who's that?

148
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,295
That's the new teacher.

149
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,969
Good evening.

150
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,733
Good evening, Madame.

151
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,692
- Well, just in town and you're already
at the pub. We'll be great friends.

152
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,969
I live here.

153
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,489
- Do you want a drink?
- No, thanks.

154
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,498
- You've got principles.
- No. I’m just not thirsty.

155
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,295
- You have a pretty laugh.
Jacqueline, my pastis!

156
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,499
You have a minute!
Have a seat.

157
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,816
Yes

158
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,852
I’m bored, you see.

159
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,654
- I understand, you are used to
having strong emotions.

160
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,213
You already know?

161
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,139
It's the first thing Jacqueline told me.

162
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,859
What did you say?

163
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:49,530
- When a man like Milan
settles here...

164
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,015
- Jacqueline!
- Sorry.

165
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,528
- I already knew
who your husband was.

166
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,015
Do you like racing?

167
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,452
- At home, we watch it on TV
I saw you once.

168
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,536
Oh yeah?

169
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,573
- It was a day
when Mr. Milan had won.

170
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,534
You were crying with joy.
I wish I had been in your place.

171
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,651
I'd like to see you there!

172
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:19,852
- It must be difficult to live
with a man like that. I couldn’t.

173
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,212
Surely not.

174
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,896
Hello.

175
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,089
Good evening.

176
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,530
- So champ,
already at your post?

177
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,332
Our veterinarian, Miss...

178
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,212
- Hйlиne Morel.
- Hello.

179
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,138
The new teacher.

180
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,898
Jacqueline, a Ricard.

181
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:42,137
2 Ricards.
20 under the mark like usual?

182
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,537
- No 40.
I have to get used to it

183
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,369
I'll leave you to it.

184
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,650
- Not going to play?
- No.

185
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,815
Goodbye.

186
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,373
Goodbye, Madam.

187
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,809
- Say. Join us for dinner
tomorrow evening.

188
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,930
Thanks.

189
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,335
Milan adores young girls.

190
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:14,729
No it was the year where Collins
wiped out at the chicane.

191
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,976
Milan got there
just behind

192
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,091
Monte Carlo, 2 years ago.

193
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,298
Oh yeah, 2 years already.

194
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,094
The next day we
had a sacred feast

195
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,416
Colins wanted to beat me.

196
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,973
He wanted to skin you!

197
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,489
Don’t you remember?
At the bar?

198
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,168
They sat next to us.

199
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,610
I told you: They’re scheming.

200
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,175
"They will have you in the chicane"

201
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,416
No luck for him, that year.

202
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,737
Behra was having trouble
with his tires.

203
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,330
I passed him.
He pulled a long face.

204
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,973
It was over for him.

205
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,454
Were you going fast?

206
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,857
- The Casino corner,
you enter it doing 120.

207
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,211
No one has come out alive
at more than 180.

208
00:24:57,420 --> 00:24:59,650
Wow how could you see Behra’s face?

209
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:04,138
- I was going 180, him 175.
Like 2 trains at the same speed

210
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,534
I'm silly!

211
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,253
I was at the top..

212
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,894
.. of the chicane
with Luigi. He groaned.

213
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,977
That Milan has no respect...

214
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,571
They arrived at the bottom.
Moss entered too fast and wiped out.

215
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,772
Collins caught Moss' wheel
and went out as well.

216
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,732
A pole from the chicane..

217
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,215
.. fell onto the road.
Milan arrives.

218
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,730
Makes two controlled slides
and he passes through.

219
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,532
You must have been scared.

220
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,299
We’re always scared.

221
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,299
What a life!

222
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,890
- My father bought me
my first car when I was 18.

223
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,738
I wanted to be
a race car driver..

224
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,976
and I especially wanted
to be a writer.

225
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,933
But writing is much harder.

226
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,735
At first I wrote about racing.
It was a compromise.

227
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,214
And later on I raced.

228
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,490
That’s Monza, isn’t it?

229
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,696
- Yes.
My first 1000 miles.

230
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,449
I wasn't a driver yet.
I was reporting for a paper.

231
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,379
Octave Zabo took me on
as a teammate.

232
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,093
You guys look happy.

233
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,054
- I got a taste for it.
It started with him.

234
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,409
He was great.

235
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:15,855
- Yes, but above all
he was my best friend.

236
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,493
He died.

237
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,659
Some brandy?
- Of course.

238
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,851
She's already talking like you.

239
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,335
How?

240
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,495
Nothing.

241
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,092
Is this your first assignment?

242
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,860
- Yes. I finished school
at the end of May.

243
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,494
You aren't bored in the village?

244
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,339
- Not yet. I'm preparing
for a new exam.

245
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:57,338
I want to be a travelling teacher.

246
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,776
Why are you smiling?
Does that sound funny?

247
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:04,050
No, but I don't quite understand.

248
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,809
- It's for those who've
finished junior college.

249
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,056
We have more freedom.

250
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,572
A bit of home economics
and we take care of their leisure time.

251
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,090
3 hours a week in each village per district.

252
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,612
We'll go by car.
I'll start with a 2CV.

253
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,380
It's a more enjoyable life.

254
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,252
More independant as well.

255
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,858
- Independence matters
a lot to you.

256
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,210
It's the reason I work.

257
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:38,459
When I was your age,..

258
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,935
.. I thought the meaning of independence,..

259
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,176
.. was not having to work.

260
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,291
Your parents were rich.

261
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,728
My parents?

262
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:50,571
I never knew my father. And...

263
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,897
.. my mother was
supported by a friend.

264
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,978
We spent our vacations
in his chateau.

265
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,454
2 shots.

266
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,888
In Scotland.

267
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,453
He was an Englishman,
my mother's friend.

268
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:08,458
- The situation didn't bother you?
- No.

269
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,811
He taught me English,
and good manners.

270
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,615
In exchange, I taught him
the subtleties of slang.

271
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,259
We were very good friends.

272
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,729
And when my mother
wanted me to work.

273
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,896
I laughed in her face.

274
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:27,490
And when she threatened to
cut me off,..

275
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,816
.. I said that I would hit up..

276
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,976
.. "Uncle", my mom's friend.

277
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,374
She relented?

278
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,013
She had to.

279
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,097
She could have chased you.

280
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:42,090
- A mother doesn't call the police
to bring her daughter home...

281
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,736
How do you say it?
I would say: "domestic issue".

282
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,814
That's it! I'm not looking for you.

283
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,414
Of course not my dear.

284
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,413
- You still think your
mother was wrong?

285
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,258
More than ever!

286
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,978
Doing a job that you hate, is like
sleeping with a disgusting man.

287
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,056
I love my work.

288
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,295
You are a kid.

289
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,058
When is your new exam?

290
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,536
Is it soon?
- I've known Milan for 10 years.

291
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,890
- In the middle of May.
-10 years!

292
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,574
It's even worse than
if I depended on my mother.

293
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,210
and you?

294
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,172
- Me?
- Yes, you.

295
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,938
Who do you sleep with?

296
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,690
Oh!

297
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,813
You're 20.
I hope you aren't still a virgin.

298
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,612
Roberte! I beg you.

299
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,458
- My fiancй and I,
we often...

300
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,695
Do you love him?

301
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,778
- Yes, otherwise
I wouldn't go out with him.

302
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,652
She is pure.

303
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,010
- Your fiancй
lives in the region?

304
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:52,178
- He's doing his military service
not far from here.

305
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,813
What's he going to do afterwards?

306
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,215
He's an aeronautical engineer

307
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,489
Is he your first?

308
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,130
Yes

309
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,012
Will you receive him at the inn?

310
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,178
I'm a teacher.
I can't afford the gossip.

311
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,178
He's stuck in the trenches,
at night at the end of the dance.

312
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,415
In the country?

313
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,851
The lack of comfort increases the risk.
Afterwards you can sort it out.

314
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,212
But the first time,
is always tragic for girls.

315
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,094
What about girls from Paris?

316
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,292
Oh... It happened to me...

317
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,972
.. 12 or 13 times, I don't know.
He doesn't either.

318
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,011
But it's not that bad.

319
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,539
Leave her alone!

320
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:38,131
- For the moment of course,
but you quickly forget.

321
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,058
They'll all tell you the same thing.

322
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,179
What are you looking to do?

323
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,256
To spoil your evening.

324
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,376
Come, I'll see you home.

325
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,498
Come back to see us.

326
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,928
Don't be a stranger.

327
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,210
Yes

328
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,534
- It's never easy
to live as two.

329
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,696
- How come you don't
race anymore?

330
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,413
I think I'm afraid.

331
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,216
You?

332
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,656
It was after Octave died.

333
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:37,571
When I learned of the accident,
I had a feeling, a kind of change

334
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,055
I'll drop you off here,
since you value your reputation

335
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,250
Goodnight

336
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,529
See you soon.

337
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,614
If it happens, I'll manage.

338
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,889
What?

339
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,258
You aren't going to
tell me anyways...

340
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,496
All women sort it out.

341
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:41,570
I forbid you to see those people.

342
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,658
- You don't know them.
- A woman who drinks...

343
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,613
- She's not like the others.
- Fortunately!

344
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,292
It's not that simple.

345
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,778
- If he had guts he
wouldn't have retired at 40.

346
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,538
I already explained that.

347
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:01,177
- If all race drivers gave up after
the death of a friend.

348
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,779
He's a coward!

349
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,733
- I'm sure he hasn't
had his last word.

350
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,009
and you defend him!

351
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,733
Oh, you are stupid!

352
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,211
*- Like every Sunday,
from 14:30 till 17:15,..

353
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,174
*.. On this broadcast
Raymond Marcillac will present to us..

354
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,019

360
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,054

361
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,058

362
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,254
Tomorrow, Monday March 13, the championship

363
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,210
Hello

364
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,856
Good evening

365
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,620
- This is Duval, my fiancй.
Madame Milan.

366
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,570
Hello

367
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,089
- Please to meet you.
- and Mr. Milan.

368
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,210
Hello

369
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,890
Hйlиne has told us a lot
about you. Have a seat.

370
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,013
You're an engineer?

371
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,892
Right now a Sergeant-mechanic.

372
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,455
A good use of skills

373
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,810
Cigarette?

374
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,816
No thanks.

375
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,293
He's good looking, eh?

376
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,172
He is especially nice.

377
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,699
He looks serious

378
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,731
It has been 2 years.

379
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,373
You want a drink?

380
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,730
- No thanks.
On the Ferrari?

381
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:52,249
- On the engine, cooling
follows 2 principals.

382
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,169
- He's staying with you?
- He must return to the barracks by 8pm.

383
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,814
- We could spend
the evening at the casino.

384
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,248
Does Mr. Milan want to?

385
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,415
Ask him.

386
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,735
I wouldn't dare.

387
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,690
Hold on.

388
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,895
Let's go out tonight?

389
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,170
No.

390
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,655
Hйlиne would love to come out with us.

391
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,656
Where?

392
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,293
- To the casino?
I've never been.

393
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,899
You're still a minor.

394
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,419
I don't look it.

395
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:25,169
- They'll ask for your ID,
and you have to get up early for class.

396
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,895
Already!

397
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,010
Already what?

398
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,494
A husband!

399
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,736
There!

400
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:41,057
- How old are you now?
- I was born in '39.

401
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:42,249
Very good.

402
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,612
39. 9 and 3 is 12. But that's
one of my numbers! Go, hurry!

403
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,973
I'll never know!

404
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,091
You aren't forced to play.

405
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,250
Thank you.

406
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,898
3,000 on number 12.

407
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,697
- Why does she favor certain
numbers over others?

408
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,291
- She's the same with numbers and people.
She tries to possess them.

409
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,899
and she wins?

410
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,738
at gambling, sometimes.

411
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,895
on 29!

412
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,608
and with people?

413
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:21,177
- We won't know until the final
ball has been played.

414
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,293
No more bets!

415
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,610
27 Red, odd, high
6-1 Horse

416
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,212
What's your method?

417
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,569
I lose.

418
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,930
When I lose,
I go for a drink at the bar.

419
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,095
Hey!

420
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,176
Thank you.

421
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,018
Can you bring me a scotch?
- The 6-1.

422
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,811
What are you playing now?

423
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,339
What is the table maximum?

424
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,053
-10,000 francs,
Madame.

425
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,535
The maximum on 12.

426
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,300
- It's rare for a number
to hit 2 times

427
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,937
- We take a risk...
In gambling, like in love!

428
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,699
18-21.

429
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,617
No more bets, please.

430
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,728
He will lose.

431
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,049
-100000.
- No more.

432
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,534
No more bets!

433
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,657
12 Red, even.

434
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,533
- How did you know
that he would lose?

435
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:50,774
- Him there?
Because he looked unhappy.

436
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,736
Tonight, I'm happy.

437
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,252
And when you're happy,
you win on all fronts. No?

438
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,058
-210,000, Madame.
- Thank you.

439
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,534
It's wonderful

440
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,131
Gentlemen, place your bets.

441
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,095
Place your bets.

442
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,495
- Here
Milan thought of you

443
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,690
Thank you.

444
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,409
Go there.

445
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,333
Try your luck

446
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,976
- I don't know
I dare not.

447
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,535
No more bets.

448
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:31,968
29!

449
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,334
No more bets.

450
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,251
29 Black, odd, high.

451
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,419
A suede jacket

452
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,693
A record player.

453
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,458
- Why not a grand
teaching text?

454
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,537
- A sheepskin
lined coat.

455
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,459
- Some records waiting for
the record player?

456
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,338
No. A record player

457
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,650
Milan!

458
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,259
Michиle!

459
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,178
- Ah success
in the country.

460
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,893
- Hйlиne Morel,
my niece.

461
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,250
Nice to meet you, miss.

462
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,138
Roberte is playing

463
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,614
You gave her permission?

464
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,412
Will you dance with me?

465
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,338
Don't corrupt his niece.

466
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,053
Incorruptible!

467
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,289
What room is Madame Milan in?

468
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,899
Come, I'll show you.

469
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,899
The third and final, 3.

470
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:39,091
The third and final, 3.

471
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,692
The third and final, 3.

472
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,689
Hi!

473
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,093
Back from retirement?

474
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,729
For one night.

475
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:01,979
- Nobody in Paris can understand
your dissapearance.

476
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,536
- Me? I'm with Milan,
for better or for worse.

477
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,652
-32 Red, loses.
- You make me lose

478
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,135
We are at the bar.

479
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:13,491
- I'll come when I
break the bank.

480
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,894
- You can't force a woman like Roberte
to live on a farm with pigs.

481
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,738
You think she looks after pigs?

482
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,851
Have you known her for long?

483
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,496
She was the most talented of all,
the most beautiful.

484
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:37,329
The craziest, the most true.
- You think she's changed?

485
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,532
- When Milan was sad,
she drank with him.

486
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,379
They lead the lives of monks.

487
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,729
But she loves him.

488
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,536
- When he went to see other women,
she was the most elegant.

489
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:53,733
Now he's become a misanthrope,
and she sees nobody.

490
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:57,250
- She reproaches him.
- Yes, but she stays.

491
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,855
On 4.

492
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,974
No more.

493
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,054
13 Black, odd.

494
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,337
- My numbers aren't coming out.
Did you win?

495
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,529
No.

496
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,930
Can you give me some money?

497
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,732
You forgot our rules.

498
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:04,811
Come on.

499
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:05,935
No.

500
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:17,371
- Roberte!
- Have they left?

501
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,571
Yes. Here.

502
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,897
I'm sure with this,
your luck will return.

503
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,418
I'll pay you back soon.

504
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:38,975
I like her.

505
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,249
Oh yeah?

506
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:43,096
- I've never seen
her like that.

507
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,449
She burns.

508
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,769
Come.

509
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,330
Look.

510
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,415
She's burning

511
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:14,216
Roberte is a flame. She's lit up,
she burns.

512
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,413
Games, alcohol, love
are only excuses for her to burn.

513
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,178
Just how you like her!

514
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:23,338
- It's what makes me
so fascinated by her.

515
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,533
No more bets.

516
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:34,377
29 Black, odd, and high.
Just our number.

517
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,819
- The game is over.
It will resume tommorow at 3pm.

518
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,333
Good night, gentlemen.

519
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,299
Roberte.

520
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,535
Roberte!

521
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:31,213
I have to go home.

522
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,411
Come, we'll have a drink!

523
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,019
Give me 3 shots.

524
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,133
Make it 4.

525
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,168
Stay here!

526
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:55,289
Good night

527
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,138
Good night, Hйlиne.

528
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:05,936
Good morning

529
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:06,890
Good morning.

530
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,010
Sleep well?

531
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,369
How's Roberte?

532
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:12,218
She wanted to stay at home.

533
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,571
- I was just going to
she how she's doing.

534
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,255
Wait for me.

535
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,093
I'd love to.

536
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,211
What are you doing?

537
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,254
- You got a flat tire just
when you passed me.

538
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:33,257
But that's absurd!

539
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:12,895
Yes?

540
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:15,730
Hello

541
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:16,975
Oh, it's you!

542
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,335
Wipe yourself off.
You'll catch a cold like that.

543
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,852
- We were running, but the
rain caught us by surprise.

544
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,530
Oh yeah?

545
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,337
You didn't ride your bike, today?

546
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,336
I got a flat..

547
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,054
.. just as
I ran into Mr. Milan.

548
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,415
Hйlиne,..

549
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,209
.. stay like that.

550
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,612
Does she remind you of anything?

551
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,209
We had walked for hours.

552
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,091
You told me about your job.

553
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,491
I didn't dare ask you to
go to a hotel.

554
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,015
It was raining.

555
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,053
But you didn't mind

556
00:56:11,460 --> 00:56:12,939
It was in Paris.

557
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,819
- Then when you finished
drying your hair,..

558
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,331
.. I went to the window.

559
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:28,975
Hйlиne, please.

560
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,256
Why?

561
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:37,377
- Please, humor me.
Go over to the window.

562
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,455
I stayed there for a moment
watching the Seine.

563
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,811
And then I turned around.

564
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:02,449
You were lying on the bed
smoking a cigarette.

565
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,732
You reached your hands out to me

566
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,130
Ant...

567
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,376
.. you took me by the wrists
and sat me down.

568
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,054
I was happy.

569
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,699
I was so happy that day.

570
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,256
And you told me,
that you loved me.

571
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,818
That was 10 years ago.

572
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,937
- What he'd give
to get rid of me!

573
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:42,370
How can you say that?

574
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,214
- You think you know
him better than me?

575
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,299
- If you knew how he loves you,
how he speaks of you.

576
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,489
Yeah

577
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,335
He also loved Octave.

578
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,895
Octave?

579
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,089
Did he tell you?

580
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,216
What?

581
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:03,297
Octave committed suicide.

582
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,253
He was mad at me.

583
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,809
Just before the Italian Grand Prix,..

584
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,171
.. He called home.

585
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,848
I wasn't there.

586
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,619
He begged Milan to tell
me that he could no longer,..

587
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,618
.. that I had to choose between them.

588
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:32,493
and if I didn't join him
the morning before he left for Monza,..

589
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,055
.. he would crash out in the first turn.

590
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,939
That's what he did.

591
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:43,058
Milan never told me anything.

592
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,409
That's a crime

593
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,496
A cowardly crime!

594
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,610
No!

595
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,651
- An adventurer,
a bastard!

596
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,295
- He was really in love
with Roberte.

597
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,535
Great excuse!

598
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,570
- and you, are you
capable of killing for love?

599
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:57,735
Certainly not!

600
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,252
and if he continues corrupting you,
I'll smash his face!

601
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:06,009
- You'd be too afraid of the consequences
- That's the least of my concerns.

602
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:06,970
You?

603
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:38,218
- I was a bit drunk.
Forgive me.

604
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,489
Of course.

605
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:45,213
- It makes me crazy when
I feel you walking away.

606
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,131
Anger really suits you.

607
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,536
I've never loved you so much.

608
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,133
- It's my pleasure
to be angry for you.

609
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,615
I love you.

610
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,455
- Don't you lovers
ever get bored!

611
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,492
- She irritates me!
I can't listen to her anymore!

612
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:19,214
- You'll hear it from her.
and the whole country too.

613
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,899
I do what I want.

614
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,330
- We'll say that
I'm your lover.

615
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:27,892
- What do we do in the barn?
- That's not the same thing.

616
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:32,536
- It's over. I won't go
to the barn with you.

617
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,890
I will make love
in my bed like everyone!

618
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,853
Hйlиne is right.
She's free.

619
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:44,453
We knew they were dating.
So why hide it?

620
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:46,730
You never see the bad in anything.

621
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:57,016
Where are you going?

622
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:59,734
- To get some air.
I don't feel right.

623
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,658
- You're surprised?
- Why?

624
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:06,058
- You're always like that
when you have a new love in mind.

625
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:09,134
So, sleep with her
so we can have some peace!

626
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,377
Give her a kiss for me!

627
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,059
Mr. Milan is not here.

628
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:01,854
I'm here to see Madame Milan.

629
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,770
- Oh! Just in time.
You can help me.

630
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,730
You alright?

631
01:02:44,940 --> 01:02:45,850
Yes.

632
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,729
There!

633
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,456
It will be good for Milan
to work there by the fire.

634
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:56,857
Are you always going to keep
your hair up like that?

635
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:59,051
But it doesn't matter.

636
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,255
Look.

637
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:04,258
Look how beautiful you are.

638
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:06,894
I can't teach like that.

639
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,375
- You won't be teaching
your whole life.

640
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:14,094
Something is missing
there in the middle.

641
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:16,939
I've got a table upstairs.
Come with me.

642
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:33,255
Have a look in the bathroom
You'll see better.

643
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,418
You can put some on.

644
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,930
What's the point?

645
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:15,414
Let me do it.

646
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:16,894
Why?

647
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,898
Because it amuses me.

648
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:28,415
It's silky.

649
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:30,531
I washed it this morning.

650
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,416
Milan is nervous right now.

651
01:04:38,620 --> 01:04:40,929
- The high wind puts
everyone on edge.

652
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:42,215
Yeah

653
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:47,291
It's also...
lack of sex.

654
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:51,614
When you live together a
long time, you no longer want to.

655
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,731
I already thought of that

656
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:56,500
Duval and I,
we've thought about it.

657
01:04:56,700 --> 01:04:59,168
Beware of it becoming a habit.

658
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,415
Yeah.

659
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,532
Oh, Milan, for him,
it's a habit, it's...

660
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:09,417
It's only prostitutes.
He doesn't hide anything.

661
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:12,409
He likes to tell me his exploits.

662
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:17,378
He's probably
more discreet with you.

663
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:22,730
For me, the real whores,
don't bother me.

664
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,535
But...

665
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:29,055
.. but I couldn't tolerate Juliette.

666
01:05:29,260 --> 01:05:30,579
Juliette?

667
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,730
Yes. She was my best friend.

668
01:05:34,700 --> 01:05:36,895
All the time at home.

669
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,333
She found me...

670
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:43,569
.. beautiful, intelligent,..

671
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:46,818
.. elegant.

672
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:52,053
So, the day I discovered that...

673
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,498
.. she and him...

674
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:57,972
It didn't last long.

675
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:00,294
I assure you.

676
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:09,653
What do you say?

677
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:11,653
And Juliette?

678
01:06:13,860 --> 01:06:17,455
- One night, at a friend's place,
he left with her.

679
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:20,458
And didn't return
until the next day at noon

680
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:25,338
She had the audacity to
come over a few days later.

681
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:26,939
Everyone was there.

682
01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:29,529
We had many guests then.

683
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:33,528
And then, I cursed her at the door,..

684
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,937
.. with a pair of slaps
in front of everyone.

685
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:40,895
Maybe she really loved him.

686
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:42,929
So what?

687
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:46,697
Sure, I can't prevent him
from chasing girls.

688
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:50,051
But I can't allow someone
to take my husband.

689
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:53,093
- What did Milan do
when you slapped her?

690
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,734
- He yelled a little,
for appearances.

691
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,938
To save face.

692
01:06:58,860 --> 01:07:00,373
What's become of her?

693
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:04,289
Oh, probably a whore.

694
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:06,658
She was talented for that.

695
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:09,769
And if she really loved him?

696
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,698
- But you don't love
the husband of another woman.

697
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,897
Has Milan seen her?

698
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:19,419
I don't think so.

699
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:23,734
But it would not surprise me
if he still wants more

700
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:25,851
I'm going to fix your eyebrows.
- No.

701
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:28,096
Yes. I want you to be beautiful.

702
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,051
You can look now.

703
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,893
How do you find yourself?

704
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,136
I'm a little bit frightened.

705
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:36,329
- More than ever you have the
deadly gaze of confidence.

706
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:44,331
Why do you drink so much?

707
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:56,816
- Do you have something
better to offer me than this?

708
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:03,293
- I don't want you
to be unhappy.

709
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:13,690
I want to see you in an evening gown.

710
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:24,251
I'm not unhappy, you know.

711
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,496
Here.

712
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:40,049
Look at this one.

713
01:10:40,620 --> 01:10:42,133
Its beautiful!

714
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,729
Well, try it on.

715
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,379
Try it on!

716
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:10,492
Careful of your hair!

717
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:29,098
You have beautiful breasts.
You must show them.

718
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,010
Milan said they are glorious.

719
01:11:49,780 --> 01:11:51,179
Look at yourself!

720
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:56,135
Go on the bed,
you'll see better.

721
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:11,375
You are beautiful.

722
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:14,295
You are awkward.

723
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,339
You are charming.

724
01:12:28,540 --> 01:12:31,293
Here. That's all I killed.

725
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,133
It's a dirty beast.

726
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:38,051
It looks like the birds
in my nightmares.

727
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,815
Good evening

728
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:01,055
I taught her to be beautiful.

729
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:02,895
Are you angry?

730
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:06,813
I thought you
really liked that dress.

731
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,854
and take your dirty bird!

732
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:16,211
- I'll leave you the feathers
to dress the kid.

733
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,857
But what's the matter?

734
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:24,460
- I don't know.
He's nervous.

735
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:25,854
I told you.

736
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,853
I must go.

737
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,288
You won't stay?

738
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,536
I have assignments to correct.

739
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,895
How do I take all this off?

740
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:35,579
Do you want some coffee?

741
01:14:40,460 --> 01:14:43,133
I asked if you wanted some coffee.

742
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:49,458
You can't stay angry at me, you know.

743
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:51,616
I won't give you that pleasure.

744
01:15:22,300 --> 01:15:23,130
So?

745
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:28,212
You took the pretext
to go hunting..

746
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:31,890
.. to go by Hйlиne's place
and tell her to come here.

747
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,455
You could have
hooked up with her,..

748
01:15:37,180 --> 01:15:39,535
.. instead of going
to kill a raven,..

749
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:43,289
.. to make me believe
that she came here by chance.

750
01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:47,848
Spend your life at her place
if that amuses you.

751
01:15:48,060 --> 01:15:50,779
It's your tricks that I dislike.

752
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:54,290
I don't want her to
take me for a fool

753
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:55,535
Why do you hide?

754
01:15:55,740 --> 01:15:58,732
Why should I hide anything?

755
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,056
Because you are a liar.

756
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:05,610
I also wonder why you're a liar.

757
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:08,252
It's your evil nature.

758
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,530
- It's true
I lie to you often.

759
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,575
You admit it.

760
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:14,259
I lie to you out of pity.

761
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:19,659
You don't know what I think of you
- You have pity? But no.

762
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:22,614
You are mean
like all weaklings

763
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:25,129
- That's also true
I'm afraid of you.

764
01:16:25,340 --> 01:16:27,490
You're the only one
I'm afraid of.

765
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:30,134
You are afraid to admit the truth.

766
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:34,538
- I'm afraid of you like I was
afraid of Hell when I was 13.

767
01:16:34,740 --> 01:16:37,049
You control me like a confessor.

768
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,375
You're sick!

769
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,216
I've made my life with a sicko.

770
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:46,448
And you don't have the courage
to admit that you went to Hйlиne's..

771
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:49,891
.. to tell her to come here.
- Roberte, shut up!

772
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,769
Admit the truth.

773
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:56,292
- How unhappy you'll be
the day I stop lying!

774
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:02,731
Anger! That's all you are
able to provoke from me.

775
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:06,414
Admit what!

776
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,730
I hope you die.

777
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,573
One day, I'll kill you.

778
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,175
Good night

779
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:42,169
Good night

780
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:38,615
Good morning

781
01:19:40,620 --> 01:19:43,054
- I've decided to
pick my pears.

782
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:44,249
What is that?

783
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:46,735
A lobster who grew up too fast.

784
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:48,612
It has a velvet claw.

785
01:19:49,820 --> 01:19:51,856
It won't damage the fruit.

786
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,779
Even a primitive machine helps man.

787
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:58,529
- You must have a gentle hand
else the fruit will escape.

788
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,129
Fall to the ground and
become overripe.

789
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:04,298
I'm afraid of being too clumsy.

790
01:20:05,660 --> 01:20:09,699
- You look rather embarassed
by this tool.

791
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:13,449
- Come help me tame it.
- If you want.

792
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,938
Leave one for me.

793
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:15,296
There

794
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:22,216
- I told you I was clumsy.
Go on. Taste them.

795
01:21:22,700 --> 01:21:27,728
- They aren't ripe yet.
Leave them in the granary for 3 weeks.

796
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,498
This one.

797
01:21:32,540 --> 01:21:33,939
This one instead.

798
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:44,778
You're right.

799
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:19,655
31.

800
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:22,335
32.

801
01:22:22,780 --> 01:22:25,248
They'll be good in 3 weeks.

802
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:26,529
Let's hope

803
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:29,533
I must go home

804
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:36,013
Did you love Juliette?

805
01:22:36,220 --> 01:22:38,529
Roberte told you the story

806
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:39,775
Did you love her?

807
01:22:39,980 --> 01:22:41,174
I think so.

808
01:22:41,380 --> 01:22:42,210
and she?

809
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,376
I think she loved me.

810
01:22:44,580 --> 01:22:46,775
And you never saw her again?

811
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:47,969
No.

812
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:50,339
She had to suffer

813
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:52,531
I imagine she suffered.

814
01:22:52,740 --> 01:22:55,174
You never tried to see her again?

815
01:22:55,380 --> 01:22:58,736
- Cowardice is one aspect
of married life.

816
01:22:59,260 --> 01:23:01,455
Why are you married?

817
01:23:01,660 --> 01:23:05,858
- When we got married,
we were no longer in love.

818
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,096
But she was helpless.

819
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,929
I didn't want to save myself
for a bourgeois marriage.

820
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:17,294
- She should've refused the marraige.
It wasn't her line of safety.

821
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:22,654
- She has no job. In love,
security comes with age.

822
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:28,055
- Sometimes the two of you say
some monstrous things.

823
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:31,650
And Octave?

824
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:32,929
Octave?

825
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,971
Yeah. The telephone call.

826
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,535
It's true.

827
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,496
I didn't believe it.

828
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,419
Passion has no morals.

829
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,449
I love you.

830
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:41,899
Good evening, Madame Milan.

831
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,897
Unload the car.

832
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,375
Be careful of the bottles.

833
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,738
I'm late.

834
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:56,376
There were many of cars
on the highway!

835
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:57,535
Here.

836
01:24:59,060 --> 01:25:02,496
I wasn't able to find parking
in the prefecture.

837
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,215
Look.

838
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:10,853
It's a new boy from Paris
It's not bad.

839
01:25:11,060 --> 01:25:14,132
Ah! You know
what I brought back?

840
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:19,173
A case of scotch. A change from
Radiguette's brandy.

841
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,735
Bargain.

842
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,538
Looks like it came
from a boutique.

843
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:33,897
You're making a face!

844
01:25:35,540 --> 01:25:36,734
Heartache?

845
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:41,850
Yes?

846
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,492
Italy? Did you call Italy?

847
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:49,375
- Yes. I did.
- Thank you Miss, we did.

848
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,852
I called Luigi.

849
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:59,411
- You called your manager
while on vacation...

850
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,338
My vacation is over.

851
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:03,009
Is it true?

852
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:07,738
- I was lucky, a place opened at Ferrari
I was offered a contract.

853
01:26:07,940 --> 01:26:09,419
What position?

854
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:10,575
The last.

855
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:14,693
- You can't accept.
They'll pass you off a spare car.

856
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,051
Training starts next week.

857
01:26:18,260 --> 01:26:18,976
At Modena?

858
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,090
Yes.

859
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,733
I do like Modena.

860
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:23,658
Who says I'm taking you?

861
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:27,535
- You'll be unhappy
if you have no one to torture.

862
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:29,739
We'll celebrate.

863
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:33,933
I almost suspected it:
Because I bought lots of food.

864
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,538
- All preserved food!
You two eat poorly.

865
01:26:40,740 --> 01:26:42,935
It makes up for our drinking.

866
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:46,974
In fact you don't have to worry
anymore, we're leaving.

867
01:26:47,180 --> 01:26:48,169
Where are you going?

868
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,689
- Milan is back in action,
we're leaving for Italy

869
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:55,530
- I knew you'd go.
You guys need your fun.

870
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,971
Hйlиne is what worries me.

871
01:26:59,180 --> 01:27:00,169
Why?

872
01:27:01,820 --> 01:27:05,893
- It wouldn't surprise me
if she has a crush on Milan.

873
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:09,098
You haven't noticed?

874
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:13,134
When he's not busy with her,
she's ready to cry.

875
01:27:13,340 --> 01:27:17,572
- She's always around
Your stories go straight to her head.

876
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:18,974
It will pass.

877
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:24,731
- Yes, but for kids
of that age, it can be serious.

878
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:28,898
I don't want her
to do something foolish.

879
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,019
What's going on?

880
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:19,448
We never see you anymore.

881
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:22,128
- I have work
My exam is approaching.

882
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:24,012
You're not upset with Milan?

883
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:25,175
Why?

884
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:31,414
- Don't blame him.
It's his 40 year equinox.

885
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:34,860
But what a number with his raven!

886
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:36,939
I forgot all about it.

887
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:38,255
You coming for dinner?

888
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:41,577
- No. Duvel might be coming.
Another time.

889
01:28:41,780 --> 01:28:44,897
- Don't delay if you want
to say goodbye to Milan.

890
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:45,930
Goodbye?

891
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:49,610
- You haven't heard the news?
The press had nothing to say?

892
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:52,334
He's resuming training at Ferrari.

893
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,011
- So we won't see him anymore
around here?

894
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:58,656
- He's going to race in all the Grand Prix
January in Buenos Aires,..

895
01:28:58,860 --> 01:29:01,852
.. March, Mexico,
April, Monaco.

896
01:29:02,420 --> 01:29:04,092
are you leaving too?

897
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:08,578
- Like usual, trailing from behind.
To chase away the reporters.

898
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:12,329
and to handle the hero's
bad moods.

899
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:16,738
Luigi is coming to sign his contract.
Are you not coming?

900
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:19,379
Yes I'm coming.

901
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:29,214
You're sure, you don't regret anything?

902
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,899
Absolutely sure.

903
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:34,250
You care so much for this girl?

904
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:36,690
Enough to know what I'm doing.

905
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:40,248
- And you've never slept with her?
- No.

906
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:50,975
I love her innocent gaze, her sincerity.

907
01:29:51,180 --> 01:29:54,252
All that wouldn't last
living with me.

908
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:57,577
One year of crazy love
and 10 years like Roberte and I had

909
01:29:57,780 --> 01:29:59,293
What do you know?

910
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,936
- It's inevitable. I've had
10 years to understand it.

911
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:19,530
Here!

912
01:30:20,740 --> 01:30:22,776
You're never late!

913
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:24,174
Dear Roberte!

914
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:27,531
The country suits you.
- Did you have a good trip?

915
01:30:27,740 --> 01:30:31,779
- I drove all night.
- There's not one minute to lose, is there.

916
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,059
Hйlиne, come!

917
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:40,330
This is Luigi, the sporting
director of Ferrari.

918
01:30:40,540 --> 01:30:42,258
Hйlиne Morel, our friend.

919
01:30:42,460 --> 01:30:43,415
A pleasure.

920
01:30:43,700 --> 01:30:47,010
- You're going to have dinner with us
and discuss the contract.

921
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:48,369
But it's been signed.

922
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:50,895
You took advantage of my absence!

923
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:55,252
When Milan trusts
someone, he'll sign anything.

924
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,257
But Luigi is a bandit.

925
01:30:57,460 --> 01:31:02,136
- Milan knew very well what he wanted.
I couldn't say a thing.

926
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:05,696
- You've become a businessman?
- Anything can happen.

927
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:07,333
When do we leave?

928
01:31:07,780 --> 01:31:10,499
Milan has to be there tomorrow.

929
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:12,850
I'll go pack quickly

930
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:17,019
Have you booked our rooms?
- Milan prefers to stay at the factory.

931
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:20,735
No. They'll talk shop all the time.

932
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,293
He will live alone.

933
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,615
What?

934
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,050
It's in the contract.

935
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,695
And me?

936
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:29,175
You stay.

937
01:31:31,340 --> 01:31:32,614
Are you kidding?

938
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:41,898
- Every month, we'll send
you a third of his salary.

939
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,649
You're taking her?

940
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:05,370
No.

941
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:27,698
I don't want to start over with her
what we've already done so well.

942
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:51,338
Get in. I'll take you back.

943
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:11,659
Take the wheel.

944
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:07,939
He's gone.

945
01:35:20,780 --> 01:35:22,930
What are you going to do now?

946
01:35:23,940 --> 01:35:25,009
Nothing.

947
01:35:28,180 --> 01:35:32,139
I'll never have the time
to live a great love.

948
01:35:32,340 --> 01:35:33,568
But I love you.

949
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:38,609
Me too.

950
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,013
You coming?

951
01:35:51,340 --> 01:35:53,490
It's time for dinner.

952
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:59,009
- It will take a moment.
It won't move. This is troubling.

953
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,370
Maybe we should go there.

954
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,172
Where exactly?

955
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:06,053
It's on the high road.

956
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:07,215
It's far.

957
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:08,773
What's happening?

958
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:13,576
- He said he saw flames.
- A car that's stuck.

959
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:16,613
- They won't make it out alone
- Let's go.

960
01:36:16,820 --> 01:36:20,096
We'd better go look Auguste.

961
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:22,052
Start dinner without me.

962
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,256
We should see the headlights.

963
01:37:01,460 --> 01:37:04,293
- They must have wanted
to save their battery.

964
01:37:31,300 --> 01:37:33,814
They were stuck right here.

965
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:36,931
They got out alone.

966
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:40,894
- They had to turn around.
- No the tracks continue.

967
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,178
Where does this path lead?

968
01:37:45,180 --> 01:37:47,899
- It ends abruptly at
the edge of the pond.

969
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,691
But that's the car of...

970
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:14,894
We must inform Milan.
Where can we place a call to Modena?

971
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:38,769
Hey, Milan!

972
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,012
Hi, how are you?

973
01:38:43,780 --> 01:38:46,453
You weren't made for the country.

974
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:48,093
The country is good.

975
01:38:57,300 --> 01:39:00,656
Tell me a little, and Roberte?

976
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:03,056
Roberte is staying in the village.

977
01:39:03,260 --> 01:39:04,056
Ah?
