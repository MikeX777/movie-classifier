00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,418
'One.

2
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,175
'Two.

3
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,057
'Three.

4
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:04,606
'Foun

5
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,904
'Five.

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,578
'Six.

7
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,002
'Seven.

8
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,593
'Eight.

00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,099
'Nine.

'Ten.

'Twere.

13
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,210
'Thirteen.'

14
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,055
And what was your last job?

15
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,768
Well, er... I've kindajust done
odds and ends to get by, er...

16
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,771
You know, waitress, cleaning.

17
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,567
I just really would like a job
doing something

18
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:58,029
where I could feel
like I was doing something good.

19
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,322
This is our training room.

20
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:03,493
We don't get to use it that often, but
it's great to have when we get to use it.

21
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,621
We help support individuals
with disabilities in the community

22
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:10,417
to live in their homes
and have lives just like you and I.

23
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:13,128
And here's our kitchen
where the dsp stores serve food

24
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,672
and prepares their lunches.

25
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,090
The hours are kinda crazy.

26
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,134
You come in
and work two days on.

27
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,595
Then you come back
and work two nights on

28
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,638
- and you have to stay awake all night.
- Ok.

29
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,392
I... I don't sleep much anyway
so that'll be fine.

30
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:35,442
This is the area they come in
if they want to do puzzles or whatnot.

31
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,152
- And this is Patricia.
- Hi.

32
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,529
Patricia, can you say hi
to my friend, Katie?

33
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,156
How are you?

34
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,410
Hi, Barbra.
Can you say hi to my friend, Katie?

35
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,620
- Hi there.
- Hi.

36
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,330
- How are you?
- Good.

37
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,456
Good.

38
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,249
You guys said hi
to my friend Katie?

39
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,711
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you doin'?

40
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,590
- You getting sleepy, Ricky?
- No, I ain't sleepy.

41
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,929
We're getting ready to eat, ok?

42
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,515
- This is Jeffrey.
- You getting hungry?

43
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,141
- Danny.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,685
- And this is Stephanie.
- Hi, Stephanie.

45
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,580
Hi, Stephanie.
This is my friend Katie.

46
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,106
She's gonna be working
in your home.

47
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,067
- Hi.
- Is that ok?

48
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:18,193
Yeah.

49
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,487
- This is declay.
- Hi.

50
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,030
Brittany.

51
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,494
Hello.

52
00:05:27,619 --> 00:05:30,622
This is Katie. She's gonna come
to work for us, guys.

53
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,267
Look at that pretty colouring.

54
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,917
What are you colouring?

55
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:36,878
Are you colouring?

56
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,505
What's that?

57
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,507
That's pretty.

58
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,716
And this is Brandy.

59
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,928
She's gonna be who you're following
for the next few days.

60
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,054
- Hey.
- Hey.

61
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,180
Can you take her on?

62
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,908
I'm gonna go up.
I've got some things I need to do.

63
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,350
- Sure.
- Finish the tour.

64
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,352
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

65
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:56,565
So this is our room
we use for the clients for the jobs.

66
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,360
They train in here for that. They're
all out for the day right now, though.

67
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,987
Ok.

68
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,157
Our computer room.

69
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,119
You do your notes
and stuff like that in here.

70
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,372
- A lot of employees just gossip mainly.
- All right.

71
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:15,458
We use this area over here
for our planner outings in the morning.

72
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,419
- That's what are they.
- Ok.

73
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,923
We have puzzles.
They love working on puzzles.

74
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,466
Pretty.

75
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,820
We usually hang them up
but we got a couple

76
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,637
that rip them off the walls.

77
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:30,307
If they get tired
they can rest in there or whatever.

78
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:32,350
- Ok.
- Here... it's the moors.

79
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,353
Is what their medications they get,
what the doctor prescribes,

80
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,314
all health information.

81
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,941
We use this room
for physical therapy.

82
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:43,737
If they're sick and wanna take a nap,
they'll just come in here and lay down.

83
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,615
You make sure you keep
your medications locked at all times.

84
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,992
And you lock the door
when you go out.

85
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,963
You'll get used to it,
it ain't no big deal.

86
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:54,122
That's a lot.

87
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,708
- Are those your trophies over there?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,501
What'd you win them for?

89
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,003
Basketball!

90
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,882
- You must be good.
- Oh, yeah. Good.

91
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,177
- How many trophies do you have?
- Two.

92
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,513
Two, two, three.

93
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,225
- So you like fishing?
- Yeah.

94
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:16,436
Where do you usually
go fishing at?

95
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,897
What kinda fish
do you like to catch?

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,403
How do I help you?

97
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,702
What's on it?

98
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,081
Fish! Ah! Er...

99
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,544
Large fin. Like this.

100
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,421
And... oh!

101
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,262
I don't know.

102
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,889
Fish!

103
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,519
- Are you making me a picture?
- Yeah, your picture.

104
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,271
Oh, it's pretty.

105
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,732
- Do you want help colouring?
- No, I can do it.

106
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,859
You can do it yourself? Ok.

107
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,112
I might mess it up.

108
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:14,536
Can you put your name on it?

109
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:19,165
You wanna do that in red or green?
Green? Yeah.

110
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,169
You have a lot of friends in here?
Yeah?

111
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,880
Oh, I love it.

112
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:28,049
- It's for me?
- Yeah.

113
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,554
Done.

114
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,640
I'm done.

115
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,832
Oh, hey.

116
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,375
How was your first day?

117
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,170
It, er... it felt really good.

118
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:11,092
Brandy said that you did
really well with the clients back there.

119
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,386
It was... it was a lot of fun.

120
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:17,515
So where are you staying at?
I know you're new in the area.

121
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,976
I actually got a place
in the country.

122
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,521
It needs a little work,
but I'm hoping to stay there for a while.

123
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,488
'Your family didn't understand you.

124
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,491
'They didn't deserve you.

125
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,579
'You have a new family now.'

126
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,672
'The devils.

127
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,800
'They listen to the sounds
of the innocent.

128
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,928
'One.

129
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,182
'Two.

130
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,268
'Three.'

131
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:50,251
'This is Katie.'

132
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,879
she's gonna be our guest
for a while.

133
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,051
Go on.

134
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,222
You're ready for this dance.

135
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:10,104
All right. Let's go get in.

136
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,401
All right, come on
and get in over here.

137
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:23,674
- Go around the front.
- Do you sit up here in the front?

138
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,435
Getting in on this side?

139
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,874
Do you wanna get in
on this side or the other side?

140
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,502
- Yeah. The other side.
- Yeah?

141
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,462
Do you want me to bring
Stephanie over there?

142
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:38,341
Right, I'm gonna scoot over you
if you don't mind.

143
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,802
- I don't mind.
- Can I sit by you, Steph?

144
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:43,179
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

145
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,975
All right. Are you buckled up?

146
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,936
- You need a tissue?
- Yes.

147
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,813
Well, you got two in your hand.

148
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,735
Who's ready to go dance?

149
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,614
- I am.
- You are? You excited, Petra?

150
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,951
- Er... I guess so.
- We're almost there.

151
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,787
Hold on.
Don't take your seatbelt off yet.

152
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,247
All right, come on.

153
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,874
Let's go dance.

154
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,128
Hold on, stephie.

155
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:17,422
- Stephie kinkle!
- Uh-oh.

156
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,300
- Hold on.
- You gotta sit down and wait your turn.

157
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:24,572
- Are you ok?
- Yeah.

158
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,825
My... my head'sjust hurting me
all of a sudden.

159
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,496
Let's go ahead and have a seat.

160
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,998
Go ahead, Jeffery.

161
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,421
All right.

162
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,964
All right, Petra.

163
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,508
What kind do we have?

164
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,680
I think I just want cheese.

165
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,974
Can I sit by you? Ok.

166
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:03,820
Ok. I'd like to take this time
to welcome Katie to our team.

167
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,865
Can you say, "hi, Katie"?

168
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,076
- Hi.
- Hi.

169
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,287
So if she needs anything
you guys help her out

170
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,581
cos we need her
to hang around for a while.

171
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,003
Thank you.

172
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,383
She's never done this
for anyone else before.

173
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,061
Are you ok?

174
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:40,022
Yeah, I'm just getting a headache again.
Can I use the client bathroom?

175
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,274
Yeah, that's fine.

176
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,340
It's gonna be fine.

177
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,344
It's too soon anyway.

00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:53,304
It's gonna be fine.

179
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,586
You sure you're ok?

00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,630
Yeah, I'm good.

181
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,962
"'The blood shows the devils
the way."'

182
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,962
'For a life is given
and the devil is born.'

183
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:39,470
You're at the group home

Ok. Sounds good.

So this is stephie's spot

202
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,671
Don't try to take her spot
cos she's gonna let you know.

203
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,344
Is this where you

204
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:43,010
Stephie, talk to ms Katie.

205

She's gonna be up and down

217
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,759
You have to be awake,
very important.

Anything really crazy,

Hello?

296
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:20,467
Hey.

297
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,554
I didn't hear you come in.

298
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,516
Sorry. I, er... I knocked,
but I didn't hear anybody.

299
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,685
You need somethin'?

300
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:32,688
A cow heart if you've got one.

301
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,097
Come on, come on.

302
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,224
Get over here. Come on.

303
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,851
There you go. Come on.

304
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,656
So we use them all
to know when they're comin'.

305
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,244
You feel that down here.
You can feel that.

306
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,580
You can feel it beat.

307
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,503
It works a lot better
when it's not inside.

308
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,927
Be careful.

309
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:12,222
- Well, hey. Welcome back.
- Hello.

310
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,767
You wanna go in here?
You wanna go in and sit down?

311
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:19,146
- I'm gonna sit down.
- You gonna sit down there? Ok.

312
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:22,107
Hey. How are you?
Did you have a good day?

313
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,234
Let's go to your chair.

314
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,027
Sound good?

315
00:32:26,153 --> 00:32:28,572
Ok. Hey, Steph.

316
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,993
You all rested up?

317
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:35,120
Well, I...

318
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:40,083
Oh, yeah. Like I said,
I don't really sleep much so I'm good.

319
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,712
Hey, er...

320
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:47,090
How was Stephanie today?

321
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,426
She stayed by herself
most of the day.

322
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:50,552
Why?

323
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:54,431
It was probably nothing.
I just...

324
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,224
It was probably nothing.

325
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:21,333
All right.
Let's get you in here.

326
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,688
- Is that good, Steph?
- Yeah.

327
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,214
Ok.

328
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,174
Here you go.

329
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:31,301
That look good?
There's your spoon.

330
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:14,010
Steph, are you ok?

331
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,388
It's ok.

332
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,431
Stephanie is sick.

333
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:21,059
I'll get this out of your way.

334
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:49,165
'Where are you, mummy?'

335
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,085
'stop it!'

336
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:56,381
'mummy! Help me!'

337
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,477
'Please help me, mummy!'

338
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,575
Take a big breath in and out
one more time.

339
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:26,035
Ok, good.

340
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,038
Now...

341
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,252
Ok. Did you say
she got sick last night?

342
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,380
Yeah, but I didn't notice
a fever or anything though.

343
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,507
Ok.

344
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:43,970
I think she might have just a little bit
of a respiratory infection

345
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,931
and we'll just watch it for now

346
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,643
and maybe get some lab work
and see what that shows us, ok?

347
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,872
- Thank you.
- You're doing good. You're good.

348
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,356
Ok.

349
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,199
Hey.

350
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,702
We can't have you getting sick,
you hear me?

351
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,664
I'm not gonna let them
get you too.

352
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,291

356
00:39:04,384 --> 00:39:09,973
No, I just... I just write things down
so I don't forget them, so...

357
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,892
I drink every night
to do the total opposite.

358
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,980
Are you ok though?

359
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,606
I just...

360
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,109
I just worry a lot, you know?

361
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,487
About Stephanie?

362
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:28,616
She hardly ever gets sick.
She just exaggerates everything a lot.

363
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:30,743
I hope so.

364
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,790

00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:05,713
'If you only knew.'

366
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,607
- Hey, Charles.
- Goodbye, ms Kenny.

367
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,901
Have you seen Stephanie?
You know where she's at?

368
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,028
I don't know.

369
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,262
Stephie, you wait on me, ok?

370
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:56,222
Unbuckle.

371
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,238
- Hey.
- Hey.

372
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,363
Sorry, it took us forever
to get here this morning.

373
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,826
Is she ok?

374
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,536
Yeah. She was like,
stuck in the bed.

375
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,496
I don't know,
it's like she was glued down.

are our dogs and our cats.

389
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,016
There are adoptions we like
to make sure that they have a yard.

390
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,977
- Do you have a yard?
- Mm-mm.

391
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,687
So we're needing something small.

392
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,610
Here are our cats.

393
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:26,344
- Who's this one?
- That's mr will pickle.

394
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,312
- There you go.
- All right.

395
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,857
- Thanks.
- Yes, ma'am. Be careful.

Hey.
You just won't be quiet, will you?

397
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,889
I'll come back for you
in a little bit, ok?

398
00:49:04,442 --> 00:49:07,445
Hey, Steph. Did you do ok today?

399
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:10,781
Yeah. She threw up
on and off all daylong.

400
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,117
Is she doing any better now or?

401
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:17,997
No, we had her doctor's appointment
rescheduled for tomorrow.

402
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:22,126
Maybe they can do something
cos she's just getting worse.

403
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,587
All right.
Well, I'll take care of her.

404
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,799
- All right. Have a good one.
- You too.

405

Beat a cat once,
they never come back.

409
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,384
Give it a place with a lot of food.
It'll keep coming.

410
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,011
Why so many?

411
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:59,014
To protect us. To call them.

412
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,433

- What?

421

- A cat.

and get her.

- Do you wanna go back with her?
- Yeah.

425

Stephie, you're gonna let ms Katie
go back with you?

427

- Yeah.
- Ok.

428
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,519

You ready to come on back?

429
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,729

around your arm, ok?

- It will be quick, ok?
