1
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,631
<i>The logical thing,</i>

2
00:00:29,664 --> 00:00:32,867
<i>the sane thing,</i>
<i>is to stay on shore.</i>

3
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,645
<i>But they paddle out.</i>

4
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:22,650
<i>Now,</i>
<i>it's easy to understand</i>

5
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:24,318
<i>the fun side of surfing.</i>

6
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:28,088
<i>Grown men and women frolicking</i>
<i>in the gentle waves of summer.</i>

7
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:35,997
<i>But then,</i>
<i>there are the others.</i>

8
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,299
<i>What are we to make of it?</i>

9
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:40,768
<i>In the face of an unfeeling,</i>

10
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:43,605
<i>unthinking, uncaring force,</i>

11
00:01:43,638 --> 00:01:47,041
<i>they choose to put</i>
<i>themselves in harm's way.</i>

12
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,912
<i>It's easy</i>
<i>to dismiss them as crazy,</i>

13
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:53,848
<i>mindless daredevils</i>
<i>without a cause.</i>

14
00:01:57,384 --> 00:01:59,486
<i>But yet we are transfixed.</i>

15
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,655
<i>Why are we drawn to it,</i>

16
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:03,524
<i>when we can't see the meaning</i>
<i>amid the maelstrom?</i>

17
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,564
<i>Why are we thrilled to</i>

18
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,966
<i>a dance surrounded</i>
<i>by violence?</i>

19
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,040
<i>Everyone has dreams.</i>

20
00:02:19,073 --> 00:02:20,575
<i>Everyone is</i>
<i>afraid of the dreams</i>

21
00:02:20,608 --> 00:02:22,142
<i>and a lot of people</i>
<i>are not able</i>

22
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,143
<i>to achieve their dreams</i>

23
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,178
<i>because of fear</i>
<i>gets in the middle of it.</i>

24
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,581
<i>Facing fear in the eyes,</i>

25
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,716
<i>and really</i>
<i>overcoming that fear...</i>

26
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,687
<i>The big challenges</i>
<i>are always scary.</i>

27
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,788
<i>But the bigger the challenge,</i>

28
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,056
<i>the more</i>
<i>it's going to help you to</i>
<i>grow.</i>

29
00:02:35,089 --> 00:02:37,357
<i>Whatever walk of life</i>
<i>you are from,</i>

30
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:40,193
<i>you have your challenges</i>
<i>and your big waves to surf.</i>

31
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,163
<i>Everyone has that fear</i>
<i>that that's holding them</i>
<i>back,</i>

32
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,832
<i>and you have to</i>
<i>face that fear.</i>

33
00:02:47,602 --> 00:02:49,103
<i>If fear</i>
<i>held us back,</i>

34
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:51,105
<i>would there be</i>
<i>a landing on the moon?</i>

35
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:54,509
<i>Would there be miraculous</i>
<i>life-saving vaccines?</i>

36
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:56,044
<i>Would we have tamed fire?</i>

37
00:02:56,077 --> 00:02:58,278
<i>And would we discover</i>
<i>the unimaginable</i>

38
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,947
<i>but inevitable next?</i>

39
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,416
<i>The answer is...</i>

40
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,052
<i>They don't stay on land.</i>

41
00:03:04,652 --> 00:03:05,787
<i>They paddle out.</i>

42
00:03:08,723 --> 00:03:10,158
<i>Maybe the way to understand,</i>

43
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,326
<i>to make paddling out part of</i>
<i>all our lives,</i>

44
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,962
<i>is to follow as a half dozen</i>

45
00:03:14,996 --> 00:03:17,699
<i>of the best big wave surfers</i>
<i>in the world</i>

46
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:18,766
<i>live their lives</i>

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,234
<i>through a big wave winter</i>
<i>around the globe.</i>

48
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:33,047
<i>It's the season</i>
<i>when the North Pacific</i>

49
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,182
<i>and the North Atlantic</i>

50
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,218
<i>pump out massive waves</i>
<i>generated by massive storms.</i>

51
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,527
<i>Perhaps the answer,</i>
<i>the inspiration</i>

52
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:49,130
<i>and maybe even the meaning</i>

53
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:50,230
<i>will reveal itself.</i>

54
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:04,311
<i>We start off our journey</i>
<i>in Nazare, Portugal,</i>

55
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,847
<i>an ancient fishing village</i>

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,782
<i>that has emerged</i>
<i>as the epicenter of</i>

57
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:10,051
<i>big wave surfing</i>
<i>in the last 10 years.</i>

58
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:19,160
<i>It's rooted in an age old</i>
<i>seafaring country</i>

59
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,662
<i>where exploration</i>
<i>and leaving the shore</i>

60
00:04:21,696 --> 00:04:23,664
<i>are part of the national DNA.</i>

61
00:04:27,635 --> 00:04:30,505
<i>That sailing,</i>
<i>that ocean culture</i>

62
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,206
<i>of the early explorations</i>
<i>of Portugal</i>

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,776
is really reflecting back,
here in Nazare,

64
00:04:34,809 --> 00:04:37,145
you know, like a man at sea.

65
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:41,983
<i>You know, a more evolved,</i>
<i>more technological...</i>

66
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,918
<i>We're exploring the world</i>
<i>through the waves,</i>

67
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,120
and we are raising
the flag of Portugal

68
00:04:46,154 --> 00:04:48,823
<i>through our wave surfing,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

69
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,191
<i>For Nic Von Rupp,</i>

70
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:52,392
<i>he discovered</i>
<i>his passion for big waves</i>

71
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,028
<i>while competing</i>
<i>in small ones.</i>

72
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,230
<i>Winning contests</i>
<i>wasn't enough of a reward</i>

73
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:58,498
<i>as he battled</i>
<i>on the pro circuit.</i>

74
00:04:58,533 --> 00:05:00,601
<i>He thirsted</i>
<i>for a bigger challenge.</i>

75
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:01,702
<i>Literally.</i>

76
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:03,237
Like, I was being successful,

77
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:04,371
my sponsors were backing me,

78
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:06,774
like, financially was the best
year of my life and...

79
00:05:06,808 --> 00:05:08,209
But it was really like,
I was like,

80
00:05:08,242 --> 00:05:09,710
"Yeah, I want to be happy,"
you know, like,

81
00:05:09,744 --> 00:05:11,344
I want to do what
I want to do.

82
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,847
And that was it.

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,848
I told my sponsors. I'm like,

84
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:16,751
"Guys, I'm gonna focus
on big wave surfing."

85
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:18,719
<i>Despite success</i>
<i>in competition,</i>

86
00:05:18,753 --> 00:05:20,021
<i>knowing better big waves</i>

87
00:05:20,054 --> 00:05:22,757
<i>were breaking elsewhere,</i>
<i>was too much for him.</i>

88
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,060
<i>He gave up one possible</i>
<i>career,  but found another</i>
<i>one,</i>

89
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:29,764
<i>in life threatening,</i>
<i>but uniquely</i>
<i>rewarding big surf.</i>

90
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,431
<i>Carrying on</i>
<i>the Portuguese tradition</i>

91
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,900
<i>of taking on the sea.</i>

92
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,640
<i>Nazare embodies,</i>
<i>the essence of this history.</i>

93
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:40,775
<i>Where legend has it,</i>

94
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,544
<i>a hunter was saved</i>
<i>on a cliff's edge by a saint,</i>

95
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:47,815
<i>infusing the seaside town,</i>
<i>with a deep religious</i>
<i>overlay,</i>

96
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:48,783
<i>including a church,</i>

97
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,018
<i>originally founded</i>
<i>in the 14th century.</i>

98
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:09,604
<i>In more recent times,</i>

99
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,905
<i>the fishing village was known</i>

100
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,241
<i>for tragic widows</i>
<i>and special dresses</i>

101
00:06:13,274 --> 00:06:15,843
<i>telling the story of</i>
<i>lost husbands at sea.</i>

102
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,011
<i>But the same wave that</i>

103
00:06:50,044 --> 00:06:51,946
<i>caused tragedy</i>
<i>for the fisherman,</i>

104
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,749
<i>is the siren</i>
<i>for today's pilgrims.</i>

105
00:06:54,782 --> 00:06:56,449
<i>The surfing story of Nazare,</i>

106
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,985
<i>starts with one man,</i>

107
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,487
<i>a struggling</i>
<i>Hawaiian big wave surfer,</i>

108
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,156
<i>Garrett McNamara,</i>

109
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,059
<i>who stumbled on Nazare</i>
<i>back in 2012.</i>

110
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,796
<i>We really needed</i>
<i>someone experienced.</i>

111
00:07:08,829 --> 00:07:09,764
Uh, like Garrett, you know,

112
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,265
at the time,
he must have been 40 already,

113
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,868
like, had tons of experience
coming from Hawaii.

114
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,771
<i>Hawaii, was, and is</i>
<i>the epicenter</i>

115
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,572
<i>when it comes down</i>
<i>to technologies</i>

116
00:07:18,606 --> 00:07:19,807
<i>of big wave surfing</i>
<i>and knowledge,</i>

117
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,208
<i>and safety,</i>
<i>and so on.</i>

118
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:25,313
<i>So bringing all that</i>
<i>knowledge to Portugal,</i>

119
00:07:25,346 --> 00:07:27,815
<i>has really revolutionized</i>
<i>this place, you know.</i>

120
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,088
<i>This town here,</i>
<i>this used to be a...</i>

121
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,023
<i>Sorry to say, and I don't</i>
<i>mean to offend</i>

122
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:37,758
<i>anyone here in Nazare,</i>
<i>but this used to be like...</i>

123
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,761
<i>Ten years ago, used to be a</i>
<i>shitty town.</i>

124
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,531
<i>Everyone was broke.</i>

125
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:44,532
<i>Middle of a crisis.</i>

126
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,866
<i>Restaurants were closed.</i>

127
00:07:47,735 --> 00:07:49,437
<i>In the interim decade,</i>

128
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,172
<i>things have changed.</i>

129
00:07:52,807 --> 00:07:55,343
<i>If you walk</i>
<i>through the town,</i>

130
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:56,978
<i>restaurants are full,</i>

131
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,913
<i>people are drinking beers</i>
<i>on the streets,</i>

132
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,815
<i>you know,</i>
<i>like, everyone's happy,</i>

133
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:02,249
<i>everyone is making a living.</i>

134
00:08:17,465 --> 00:08:18,766
Big wave,

135
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,768
Nazare.

136
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,769
<i>There's people</i>
<i>flying from</i>

137
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:24,271
<i>all over the world</i>
<i>to come see this place.</i>

138
00:08:24,305 --> 00:08:25,706
<i>And the truth is,</i>
<i>the best place</i>

139
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,942
<i>to see big waves</i>
<i>is, is here.</i>

140
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,482
<i>What draws surfers</i>
<i>from nations around the world</i>

141
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:35,883
<i>is not just the size,</i>

142
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:38,819
<i>but the incredible,</i>
<i>unmatched consistency</i>

143
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:40,988
<i>of the giant surf in Nazare.</i>

144
00:08:41,022 --> 00:08:43,391
<i>Making it perhaps</i>
<i>the best stage on the planet</i>

145
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:46,927
<i>for facing fears</i>
<i>and pushing boundaries.</i>

146
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,308
<i>It's still a</i>
<i>matter of patience</i>

147
00:09:01,342 --> 00:09:03,911
<i>waiting for</i>
<i>the truly epic days.</i>

148
00:09:03,944 --> 00:09:05,312
<i>And while Nazare</i>
<i>waits for these</i>

149
00:09:05,346 --> 00:09:07,114
<i>mega swells to arrive,</i>

150
00:09:07,148 --> 00:09:09,950
<i>this winter, the other side</i>
<i>of the big wave world</i>

151
00:09:09,984 --> 00:09:11,385
<i>stirs to life.</i>

152
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,256
<i>The swell is</i>
<i>forecasted to hit Peahi,</i>

153
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:18,993
<i>otherwise known as Jaws</i>
<i>on the north shore of Maui.</i>

154
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,862
<i>For tourists,</i>
<i>it's delicious idyll.</i>

155
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,130
<i>But to others,</i>

156
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:26,133
<i>it's the ultimate test</i>
<i>for a big wave surfer.</i>

157
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:33,474
<i>Among them, drawn to</i>
<i>the paddling in style at Jaws,</i>

158
00:09:33,508 --> 00:09:36,877
<i>over the jet ski assisted</i>
<i>towing approach at Nazare,</i>

159
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:39,880
<i>is South African,</i>
<i>Matt Bromley.</i>

160
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:41,550
<i>Hawaii looked like</i>
<i>it was going</i>

161
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,150
<i>into a really good pattern.</i>

162
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,885
And it looked like
there was some big storms

163
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,120
heading to Jaws.

164
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,556
<i>I kind of gave myself,</i>
<i>like,</i>

165
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:50,124
<i>I am going to stay in Hawaii</i>
<i>for a month,</i>
<i>away from my family.</i>

166
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:53,894
<i>This is my period to get</i>
<i>big waves at Jaws.</i>

167
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,863
In La Nina years,

168
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,264
the motto is,

169
00:09:57,298 --> 00:10:01,335
if there is anything, you
better go and you rearrange
your life

170
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:03,404
to chase those swells
when they are there.

171
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,706
'Cause there might not be
another one behind it.

172
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:09,110
<i>As Matt travels</i>
<i>across the planet,</i>

173
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:11,679
<i>he reflects back</i>
<i>on his previous year's trip,</i>

174
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,583
<i>where the wave of a lifetime,</i>
<i>almost came true.</i>

175
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,720
<i>This huge wall of water</i>
<i>kind of just</i>

176
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,654
<i>grew out of the deep.</i>

177
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,857
<i>And everyone is paddling</i>
<i>up the face,</i>

178
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,824
<i>and I was sitting further out</i>

179
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:25,259
<i>and I was</i>
<i>in the perfect place for it.</i>

180
00:10:25,292 --> 00:10:27,194
<i>And I swung my buoy</i>
<i>and I just thought,</i>

181
00:10:27,228 --> 00:10:29,964
"If I make this wave,
this is gonna be my ride,

182
00:10:29,997 --> 00:10:32,099
"that I've been
dreaming about."

183
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:34,401
<i>I popped to my feet</i>
<i>and this wind chop,</i>

184
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:38,038
<i>uh, hit me and caused me</i>
<i>to go into the air.</i>

185
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,007
<i>As I landed, my foot slipped,</i>

186
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,108
<i>and I landed</i>
<i>on the side of the board,</i>

187
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:43,110
<i>which sent my board</i>
<i>into a bit of a cutback.</i>

188
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:44,912
And I just remember
thinking, like,

189
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:47,448
"Oh my gosh,
this is as bad as it can get."

190
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,584
'Cause I could, kind of, see
out of the corner of my eye,

191
00:10:49,618 --> 00:10:52,554
30, 40 foot above me
that lip starting to fall.

192
00:10:57,592 --> 00:11:00,227
And the lip landed
on the tail of my board.

193
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:02,129
Exploded me so hard.

194
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,069
And it just pushed me
so deep down under the water.

195
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:13,440
<i>Everyone gets scared.</i>

196
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:17,678
And big wave surfing
is so scary and terrifying.

197
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,247
<i>But the thing is, I know</i>
<i>all of the big wave guys,</i>

198
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,317
<i>and everyone gets scared,</i>
<i>and that everyone finds a way</i>

199
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,555
to deal with that fear
and that challenge, because

200
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,123
<i>I really believe</i>
<i>that challenges that are...</i>

201
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,824
<i>The big challenges</i>
<i>are always scary.</i>

202
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,193
<i>But the bigger the challenge,</i>

203
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:34,094
<i>the more it's gonna help you</i>
<i>to grow if you can...</i>

204
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,630
<i>If you can lean</i>
<i>into that challenge</i>

205
00:11:35,664 --> 00:11:38,098
<i>and go surf that wave.</i>

206
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:40,734
<i>For me, I will travel</i>
<i>across the whole world</i>

207
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:43,103
<i>for a swell to get</i>
<i>one life-changing wave.</i>

208
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,705
<i>That's always the goal</i>
<i>when I go to places.</i>

209
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:46,941
It's not about getting
lots of fun, good waves.

210
00:11:46,974 --> 00:11:48,008
It's about getting
that one wave

211
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,678
that's gonna change my life.

212
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,013
<i>Matt is relentlessly</i>
<i>chasing the wave of his life,</i>

213
00:11:53,047 --> 00:11:54,748
<i>a journey</i>
<i>that began 20 years ago</i>

214
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:57,117
<i>at his home</i>
<i>at the bottom of the world.</i>

215
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,787
<i>There, boy.</i>

216
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,188
<i>Go big or go home.</i>

217
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:02,990
<i>Okay. See</i>
<i>what you can do.</i>

218
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,425
<i>I'll come...</i>
<i>I'm right after you.</i>

219
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,665
<i>So I am from</i>
<i>Cape Town, South Africa,</i>

220
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,168
and I grew up about half an
hour away from the beach

221
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,136
<i>and at about the age of six,</i>

222
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,505
<i>my dad would</i>
<i>take me down to the beach,</i>

223
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:20,241
<i>like, every second weekend</i>
<i>to surf the lot.</i>

224
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:22,276
<i>Learned</i>
<i>to surf waves at Muizenberg.</i>

225
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,211
And then it wasn't
until the age of 12,

226
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:27,147
when we moved to a house
on the beach in Kommetjie.

227
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,651
<i>And it's just surrounded by</i>

228
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:30,918
big surf all around.

229
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:33,420
And right in front of my house
was a wave called Sunset Reef,

230
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,422
<i>which is one of the best</i>
<i>big waves in the world.</i>

231
00:12:35,456 --> 00:12:37,491
<i>And I'll come</i>
<i>back from school,</i>

232
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,026
<i>I'll look out, and</i>
<i>I see the guys</i>

233
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,861
towing these
huge waves out there,

234
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,096
and I knew, like, one day,

235
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,199
I wanted to be involved with
that stuff, that, that action.

236
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,102
<i>And the big winter swells</i>

237
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,336
<i>on the other side</i>
<i>of the bay,</i>

238
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,705
<i>you can see the plumes</i>

239
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:53,508
of the explosions of water
going up the cliff,

240
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,476
off the Sentinel,
which is where Dungeons is.

241
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,946
And Dungeons is one of the
most feared waves in the
world.

242
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,715
<i>He would have to go</i>
<i>through the progression</i>

243
00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:02,883
<i>that all big wave surfers</i>
<i>go through.</i>

244
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:06,453
<i>Lessons learned the hard way.</i>

245
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:08,822
<i>My first experience</i>
<i>of proper big waves</i>

246
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:11,025
<i>was absolutely terrifying.</i>

247
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,560
I was sitting out there
in the lineup

248
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:14,696
<i>and then the whole horizon</i>
<i>just went dark</i>

249
00:13:14,729 --> 00:13:16,096
<i>and started to break.</i>

250
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,332
I just started to feel
this fear coming over me.

251
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,634
So I just followed the crowd

252
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:21,503
and I was greeted
by my worst nightmare.

253
00:13:21,536 --> 00:13:25,372
It's like 25 ft wall of water
breaking on my head.

254
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,044
<i>I just find myself</i>

255
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,613
overwhelmed with panic

256
00:13:31,646 --> 00:13:32,714
and fear taking over me,

257
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:34,181
my adrenaline
going through the roof.

258
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:35,617
I couldn't breathe properly.

259
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,018
<i>And I had to swim through</i>
<i>five of these,</i>

260
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:40,220
<i>like 25, 30-foot</i>
<i>walls of water.</i>

261
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,724
<i>And by the time</i>
<i>the ocean settled,</i>

262
00:13:42,757 --> 00:13:46,260
<i>I was overwhelmed</i>
<i>with fear and panic,</i>

263
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:47,595
<i>and I was like,</i>
<i>I'm out of here.</i>

264
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:49,798
<i>And I actually started</i>
<i>paddling  back towards the</i>
<i>channel</i>

265
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,667
<i>to the boats,</i>
<i>to get out the water.</i>

266
00:13:52,701 --> 00:13:56,270
<i>Shaken, demoralized,</i>
<i>wrapped up in fear</i>

267
00:13:56,303 --> 00:13:58,372
<i>and about to call it quits,</i>

268
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,509
<i>the ocean offered up</i>
<i>a life changing gift.</i>

269
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:03,010
<i>That's when</i>
<i>something amazing happened.</i>

270
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:03,844
<i>I was a little bit wider</i>

271
00:14:03,877 --> 00:14:05,279
<i>because I was paddling</i>
<i>on my way.</i>

272
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,980
<i>Another big set</i>
<i>broke over the crowd,</i>

273
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,717
and I was
in the perfect spot

274
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,050
for this
big bomb of wave.

275
00:14:10,084 --> 00:14:13,722
And something last minute
just told me to spin
and go and...

276
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:22,630
I remember turning my nose
towards the beach,

277
00:14:22,664 --> 00:14:25,834
and being lifted up by this
what felt like a mountain.

278
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,034
<i>And I looked over the edge,</i>

279
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,370
<i>and I took, like, two paddles</i>
<i>and dropped in and...</i>

280
00:14:29,403 --> 00:14:30,938
<i>Just that feeling,</i>

281
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,340
<i>picking up, like, speed</i>
<i>I've never felt before,</i>

282
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:35,409
<i>and riding this</i>
<i>huge blue wall of water.</i>

283
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:38,178
<i>And I rode all the way</i>
<i>to the channel and pulled</i>
<i>out.</i>

284
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:40,447
That was like
the biggest thrill of my life.

285
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:42,717
And I was like,
I want to do this thing.

286
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:44,686
I need to start
training for this,

287
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,086
I need to start
thinking about this,

288
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,222
and I think this is the
new course that I wanna take,

289
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,824
to be a big wave surfer.

290
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,360
<i>Chasing the wave of his life,</i>

291
00:14:53,394 --> 00:14:55,195
<i>Matt connects</i>
<i>with Torrey Meister,</i>

292
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:57,498
<i>a laid back North Shore local.</i>

293
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:59,233
I've known Matt
for a really long time,

294
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:02,069
and he's, he's always
one of my favorite guys

295
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,337
to chase swells with.

296
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,873
<i>The son of a Texas transplant,</i>

297
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:08,208
<i>Torrey is known for charging</i>
<i>Big Backdoor Pipeline</i>

298
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:10,545
<i>and following</i>
<i>in his father's footsteps.</i>

299
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:12,547
<i>There are opposites</i>
<i>who attract,</i>

300
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,683
<i>but are bound together</i>
<i>by the same passion.</i>

301
00:15:15,717 --> 00:15:17,719
My dad
was the biggest influence,

302
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:18,952
as far as surfing goes.

303
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,622
I wanted to have
a surf partner,

304
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,156
with Torrey.

305
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:24,893
So it was very, very

306
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,193
<i>important to me</i>

307
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:29,697
<i>to have my son be</i>
<i>that sort of partner.</i>

308
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:32,600
And it's for this reason
I showed him the ropes.

309
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:36,270
<i>When he taught me</i>
<i>how to surf, I just became</i>

310
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,539
<i>completely hooked right away.</i>

311
00:15:37,572 --> 00:15:39,440
I mean, I have brief memories
of telling him

312
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,742
<i>when I was five</i>
<i>or six years old,</i>

313
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:42,075
<i>like, "I want to be</i>
<i>a pro surfer,"</i>

314
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,512
<i>And he's always supported me,</i>
<i>like, since day one, you know.</i>

315
00:15:44,546 --> 00:15:45,345
<i>He's like,</i>
<i>"You can do it."</i>

316
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,549
"Just, you know,
enjoy and have fun."

317
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:49,950
<i>"Do anything you want."</i>

318
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,052
<i>The Cold Water Classic</i>
<i>was the, you know,</i>

319
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:55,122
<i>the most pivotal moment</i>
<i>in my surfing career for sure.</i>

320
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,356
<i>Event was really cool.</i>

321
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,225
It's for uh,
unsponsored surfers.

322
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,628
So they invite 16 guys
from around the world.

323
00:16:00,662 --> 00:16:03,397
<i>And they pretty much</i>
<i>let them duke it out</i>

324
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,332
<i>for a sponsorship</i>
<i>with O'Neill.</i>

325
00:16:08,202 --> 00:16:09,470
<i>And I ended up winning.</i>

326
00:16:09,504 --> 00:16:12,473
<i>And it was a... It was</i>
<i>a really special moment for</i>
<i>me,</i>

327
00:16:12,507 --> 00:16:15,108
and it totally changed
my whole career.

328
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,276
<i>Despite opening the door</i>

329
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,779
<i>to a traditional pro career,</i>

330
00:16:17,812 --> 00:16:21,381
<i>Torrey found it unfulfilling,</i>
<i>and turned his eyes and</i>
<i>efforts</i>

331
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,984
<i>to being</i>
<i>a free surfing big wave</i>
<i>rider.</i>

332
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:30,558
<i>As the first swell</i>
<i>of the season shows up,</i>

333
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:34,662
<i>the vagaries of chasing waves</i>
<i>split up the duo.</i>

334
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:38,800
<i>Matt goes to Maui, desperate</i>
<i>to catch Jaws no matter what.</i>

335
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:44,438
<i>Torrey decides to stay</i>
<i>on the north shore of Oahu,</i>

336
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,708
<i>where he thinks conditions</i>
<i>will be more favorable.</i>

337
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:50,277
<i>At dawn,</i>
<i>Matt is greeted by</i>

338
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,479
<i>a disappointing sight</i>
<i>upon his arrival.</i>

339
00:16:52,514 --> 00:16:54,281
<i>And looks to have</i>
<i>made the wrong call,</i>

340
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:55,517
<i>and won't be scoring.</i>

341
00:16:58,352 --> 00:16:59,888
<i>But the misfire on Maui</i>

342
00:16:59,921 --> 00:17:02,590
<i>is contrasted</i>
<i>with some magic on Oahu.</i>

343
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,959
<i>This particular swell,</i>
<i>while not massive,</i>

344
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:05,960
<i>hits the sweet spot,</i>

345
00:17:05,994 --> 00:17:08,897
<i>and is perfect</i>
<i>for a challenging location.</i>

346
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,933
<i>A legitimately heavy wave,</i>
<i>if not a giant one,</i>

347
00:17:11,966 --> 00:17:12,967
<i>called Haleiwa.</i>

348
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:15,570
<i>And Torrey scores,</i>

349
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,539
<i>along with an all-star cast</i>

350
00:17:17,572 --> 00:17:19,874
<i>of some of the best surfers</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

351
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,442
<i>It's one of</i>
<i>the heaviest waves,</i>

352
00:17:22,476 --> 00:17:23,511
<i>I think, in the world,</i>

353
00:17:23,545 --> 00:17:25,547
<i>and I don't think</i>
<i>people really realize that</i>

354
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,948
it will pound you
like a big wave.

355
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,583
So, it's a heavy wave.

356
00:17:28,616 --> 00:17:31,653
And that day was
especially heavy and big
and...

357
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,757
<i>The power</i>
<i>and ferocity of the wave</i>

358
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,525
<i>allow for high</i>
<i>performance surfing</i>

359
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,594
<i>in a high risk environment,</i>

360
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:43,397
<i>at least for a select handful</i>
<i>of premier surfers.</i>

361
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,066
<i>Some of the best</i>
<i>were out there tearing it up.</i>

362
00:18:15,597 --> 00:18:17,431
<i>It's great surfing, you know,</i>

363
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:20,068
<i>with that kind of level</i>
<i>out there in Haleiwa.</i>

364
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,736
<i>Those guys are like</i>
<i>all your friends and</i>

365
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:22,870
<i>they are obviously pushing.</i>

366
00:18:22,904 --> 00:18:24,872
<i>Everyone's trying to get</i>
<i>the best wave out there.</i>

367
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,141
I think that's
super healthy for the sport,

368
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,911
'cause it pushes
you as a surfer

369
00:18:29,944 --> 00:18:31,746
and as an individual.

370
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:45,258
<i>Also out that day,</i>

371
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,628
<i>was Kai Lenny,</i>

372
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:51,032
<i>arguably the best all around</i>
<i>big wave waterman in the</i>
<i>world.</i>

373
00:18:51,065 --> 00:18:54,502
<i>Having grown up on Maui,</i>
<i>just down the street from</i>
<i>Jaws,</i>

374
00:18:54,535 --> 00:18:57,038
<i>he left an indelible mark</i>
<i>on the big wave world</i>

375
00:18:57,071 --> 00:19:00,140
<i>with a single turn,</i>
<i>an incredible airdrop,</i>

376
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,743
<i>at his backyard break.</i>

377
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,411
<i>In a normal season,</i>

378
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,980
<i>he relentlessly</i>
<i>travels the globe</i>

379
00:19:06,014 --> 00:19:08,583
<i>in search of the biggest</i>
<i>waves  he can find.</i>

380
00:19:08,616 --> 00:19:09,884
<i>Pushing past fear,</i>

381
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,121
<i>and redefining what's</i>
<i>possible  at places like</i>
<i>Nazare.</i>

382
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:20,094
<i>But this season,</i>
<i>he's tethered closer to home</i>

383
00:19:20,128 --> 00:19:21,529
<i>'cause his wife is pregnant,</i>

384
00:19:21,562 --> 00:19:23,931
<i>and the birth of his twins</i>
<i>is imminent,</i>

385
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:27,001
<i>he makes the most</i>
<i>of the Haleiwa session.</i>

386
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,687
<i>Matt is burned on Maui</i>

387
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,922
<i>and Torrey</i>
<i>is scoring on the North</i>
<i>Shore.</i>

388
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:50,825
<i>But for this winter season,</i>

389
00:19:50,858 --> 00:19:52,694
<i>they've enlisted the help</i>
<i>of a liaison</i>

390
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:55,195
<i>to their surf forecaster,</i>
<i>Curtis Beck,</i>

391
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,229
<i>a surfer himself,</i>

392
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:59,701
<i>to be in the right place</i>
<i>at the right time.</i>

393
00:19:59,734 --> 00:20:03,004
<i>He injects himself</i>
<i>into what needs to happen</i>
<i>next.</i>

394
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,342
<i>I got a</i>
<i>call from Curtis,</i>

395
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,112
<i>and he just gets you psyched</i>

396
00:20:11,145 --> 00:20:12,513
<i>to go chase big waves.</i>

397
00:20:12,547 --> 00:20:15,315
You know, he's like,
"You won't believe it."

398
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:16,483
"The waves are..."

399
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,318
"are like 10 ft bigger."

400
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:19,987
You gotta get
to the airport now.

401
00:20:20,021 --> 00:20:21,089
And I was like...

402
00:20:21,122 --> 00:20:23,490
<i>It's like sprinting up</i>
<i>the Jaws part.</i>

403
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:24,559
I am a hype machine.

404
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:27,394
Where I'm a hype machine,
is trying to factor in

405
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:30,598
the odds
of where and when to be.

406
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,801
<i>There's an old</i>
<i>saying in the surf world.</i>

407
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:36,904
"Never leave good waves."

408
00:20:36,938 --> 00:20:39,774
<i>With the help of</i>
<i>surf forecaster, Mark</i>
<i>Sponsler,</i>

409
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:42,543
<i>Curtis makes the high risk</i>
<i>call  for Matt and Torrey,</i>

410
00:20:42,577 --> 00:20:45,146
<i>to head to Mavericks</i>
<i>in Northern California.</i>

411
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,814
<i>It's against</i>
<i>conventional wisdom.</i>

412
00:20:46,848 --> 00:20:48,549
<i>And with no other pro surfer</i>

413
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,085
<i>even thinking about</i>
<i>making the same call.</i>

414
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,922
The call was made on
24 hours' notice.

415
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:57,091
Mavericks is
particularly fickle,

416
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,326
in the wind area,
in local winds.

417
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,697
and the local wind models
are not the best.

418
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,364
But when you get in like a 20,

419
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:07,367
36-24 hour window,
boom!

420
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,537
All of a sudden
for this one swell,

421
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:12,372
it just...
It just... The wind

422
00:21:12,405 --> 00:21:14,041
was forecasted to disappear.

423
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:16,144
You had to be willing
to turn on the dime.

424
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,046
<i>It's late</i>
<i>in the afternoon</i>

425
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,748
<i>as Bromley heads</i>
<i>to the airport.</i>

426
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,850
<i>Torrey is just getting</i>
<i>out of the water.</i>

427
00:21:22,884 --> 00:21:24,185
<i>If Sponsler's correct,</i>

428
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:26,319
<i>they need to get on a flight</i>
<i>that evening.</i>

429
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,990
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I probably surf for,</i>

430
00:21:29,023 --> 00:21:31,159
<i>two and a half,</i>
<i>three hours or so.</i>

431
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,163
I remember coming in and
I had like, I don't know,

432
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:38,365
20 missed calls and
40 text messages,

433
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:40,034
from Curtis, like,
"We're going to Mavericks."

434
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,736
And I was like,
"What, we are?"

435
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:43,070
"Do you wanna go?"

436
00:21:43,104 --> 00:21:44,639
I was like,
"Is it gonna be good?"

437
00:21:44,672 --> 00:21:45,940
<i>And he's like,</i>
<i>"Yeah, Mark, you know,"</i>

438
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:46,974
<i>says it's gonna be good.</i>

439
00:21:47,008 --> 00:21:48,075
<i>"It looks like</i>
<i>it's gonna be."</i>

440
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:49,110
So, I was like,
"Yeah, let's do this."

441
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:51,846
So I literally...
I think I booked my ticket,

442
00:21:51,879 --> 00:21:53,548
<i>hour and a half</i>
<i>before the flight.</i>

443
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:54,615
<i>I barely made the flight.</i>

444
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,851
<i>Luckily, I had boards and</i>
<i>everything there.</i>

445
00:21:59,954 --> 00:22:02,156
I just shoved everything
into my board bags

446
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,124
and,

447
00:22:03,157 --> 00:22:04,692
and got on the plane.

448
00:22:05,827 --> 00:22:07,562
<i>They expected to see</i>
<i>other surfers</i>

449
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,429
<i>on the red eye flight</i>
<i>to San Francisco,</i>

450
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:10,598
<i>just north of Mavericks.</i>

451
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,667
<i>No one else is.</i>

452
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,135
<i>But anyway,</i>
<i>everybody made it,</i>

453
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,704
<i>and we got to sleep</i>
<i>at like 02:00 in the morning.</i>

454
00:22:32,286 --> 00:22:34,522
<i>At first, it seemed</i>
<i>the naysayers were correct</i>

455
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:35,923
<i>and no swell is to be had.</i>

456
00:22:35,957 --> 00:22:39,426
<i>And the mad dash and red eye</i>
<i>were a failed mission.</i>

457
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:42,230
<i>No one else from Hawaii</i>
<i>took Sponsler seriously.</i>

458
00:22:42,263 --> 00:22:44,799
<i>And perhaps</i>
<i>the master forecaster,</i>

459
00:22:44,832 --> 00:22:45,867
<i>got it wrong.</i>

460
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:47,301
<i>We got down</i>
<i>to Mavs in the morning</i>

461
00:22:47,335 --> 00:22:48,536
<i>and they were</i>
<i>still really small,</i>

462
00:22:48,569 --> 00:22:51,471
and I was like, "Oh my gosh,
there's no sign of the swell."

463
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:52,840
Like, "Is it coming?"

464
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:55,643
<i>Man, it looks</i>
<i>flat out there.</i>

465
00:22:55,676 --> 00:22:58,112
In the back of my mind,
I was like,
I need a swell so bad.

466
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,047
It sucked in Jaws.

467
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:02,116
It's gonna suck here.
It wasn't that big.

468
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:05,119
<i>Even though there's no surf,</i>

469
00:23:05,152 --> 00:23:08,089
<i>Torrey gets prepared</i>
<i>by picking up his board.</i>

470
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:11,859
<i>Helping on</i>
<i>the board transfer is</i>

471
00:23:11,893 --> 00:23:14,295
<i>Curt Meyers from</i>
<i>Power Lines Productions.</i>

472
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,565
<i>Along with</i>
<i>his partner, Eric Nelson,</i>

473
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:18,599
<i>they are not</i>

474
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,368
<i>a typical production company.</i>

475
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,603
<i>But they embody</i>
<i>the passion and commitment</i>

476
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:24,205
<i>of the wave</i>
<i>and surf lifestyle</i>

477
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:25,206
<i>in Half Moon Bay.</i>

478
00:23:26,741 --> 00:23:28,209
<i>So, long story short,</i>

479
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:30,645
back in the day,
I started a tv show

480
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:34,015
<i>a community access channel</i>
<i>called Powerlines, Surf</i>
<i>Spots.</i>

481
00:23:36,217 --> 00:23:37,852
<i>Curt had been</i>
<i>a lifelong fan,</i>

482
00:23:37,885 --> 00:23:39,987
<i>and he saw that the show</i>
<i>was getting stale.</i>

483
00:23:40,021 --> 00:23:43,024
<i>So, I challenged him</i>
<i>to do his own show on</i>
<i>surfing.</i>

484
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,095
Hey, are you gonna
takeover or what?

485
00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:49,597
He wants
to be the Terminator.

486
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,965
We have the <i>Curt Myer's Show.</i>

487
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,867
-Wrong.
-Gotta be on Powerlines.

488
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,169
-Curt...
-You can put yourself on,

489
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:57,204
you can put
all his buddies on,

490
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:59,472
you can put
all his little girlfriends on.

491
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:00,808
He'll be killing it, bro.

492
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:05,613
So we joined forces.

493
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,148
<i>Power Lines Productions</i>
<i>essentially</i>

494
00:24:07,181 --> 00:24:09,183
<i>was born on that...</i>
<i>Back in the day.</i>

495
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,587
<i>With world class</i>
<i>production values,</i>

496
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:14,922
<i>with Eric shooting</i>
<i>from the cliff</i>

497
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,357
<i>and Curt from the water,</i>

498
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:18,926
<i>they never miss</i>
<i>a swell or a key ride.</i>

499
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,861
<i>And represent</i>
<i>the devotion to the spot,</i>

500
00:24:20,895 --> 00:24:23,731
<i>which is the hallmark</i>
<i>of the devotees of Mavericks.</i>

501
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,304
<i>The fact is that</i>
<i>riding waves at Mavericks</i>

502
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:34,442
<i>can be traced to one man,</i>
<i>and an extraordinary story.</i>

503
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,376
<i>Growing up,</i>

504
00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:37,178
here in Half Moon Bay,

505
00:24:37,211 --> 00:24:39,880
<i>every morning</i>
<i>I sat and ate breakfast</i>

506
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:41,481
<i>looking at the ocean.</i>

507
00:24:41,515 --> 00:24:44,852
<i>And you could literally see</i>
<i>Mavericks off in the right,</i>

508
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:48,689
<i>and all the restructure</i>
<i>out in the whole bay.</i>

509
00:24:48,723 --> 00:24:51,826
<i>Discovering Mavericks</i>
<i>was literally</i>

510
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:55,229
<i>from surfing as big a waves</i>

511
00:24:55,262 --> 00:24:56,597
<i>that I could</i>

512
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,100
<i>around all the other reefs</i>

513
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:02,403
until depths would pop
in the distance.

514
00:25:03,804 --> 00:25:05,506
<i>At just 17 years old,</i>

515
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:09,010
<i>Jeff's natural desire to push</i>
<i>his limits as a surfer,</i>

516
00:25:09,043 --> 00:25:11,379
<i>led him to paddle out</i>
<i>at Mavericks,</i>

517
00:25:11,412 --> 00:25:13,414
<i>by himself.</i>

518
00:25:13,447 --> 00:25:17,418
<i> Not only did he successfully</i>
<i> surf that day, and many</i>
<i>after,</i>

519
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:20,187
<i>but no one else</i>
<i>would even attempt to surf it</i>

520
00:25:20,221 --> 00:25:21,088
<i>for years.</i>

521
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,892
<i>I went out there,</i>

522
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:28,229
<i>10 years</i>
<i>completely by myself.</i>

523
00:25:28,262 --> 00:25:30,431
<i>After flying</i>
<i>under the radar for years,</i>

524
00:25:30,464 --> 00:25:33,067
<i>Mavericks would finally</i>
<i>introduce itself</i>

525
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,036
<i>to the world stage</i>
<i>in a cover story</i>

526
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:37,538
<i>in</i> Surfer <i>magazine</i>
<i>in the 1980s,</i>

527
00:25:37,571 --> 00:25:40,574
<i>and would quickly gain</i>
<i>worldwide recognition.</i>

528
00:25:43,377 --> 00:25:44,513
<i>Most famous surf spots</i>

529
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,479
<i>around the world,</i>

530
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:47,114
<i>are shall we say,</i>
<i>less than welcoming</i>

531
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:49,984
<i>to any</i>
<i>outside visiting surfers.</i>

532
00:25:50,017 --> 00:25:52,753
<i>Despite its fame,</i>
<i>the community of Half Moon Bay</i>

533
00:25:52,787 --> 00:25:54,021
<i>has managed</i>
<i>to keep Mavericks</i>

534
00:25:54,055 --> 00:25:55,423
<i>a special place</i>
<i>for all surfers.</i>

535
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,862
<i>One of the up and coming</i>
<i>kids in our community,</i>

536
00:26:01,896 --> 00:26:03,798
<i>his approach to people was,</i>

537
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:05,399
<i>is "show up and be kind."</i>

538
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:06,734
<i>Get along with everybody</i>

539
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:10,371
<i>and be as welcoming</i>
<i>as you know?</i>

540
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,139
<i>And he was that guy.</i>

541
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,609
<i>But uh,</i>
<i>he was out surfing</i>

542
00:26:15,643 --> 00:26:17,745
and he kicked out
of a wave

543
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:19,447
and sat down
and the board collapsed,

544
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,850
and the lifeguards couldn't
get to him before he drowned.

545
00:26:24,051 --> 00:26:25,953
<i>That was his tag line.</i>

546
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:28,222
<i>So, community</i>
<i>basically kept it</i>

547
00:26:29,123 --> 00:26:32,026
and uh, try to live it.

548
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:33,761
Is that you?

549
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:35,229
-Yeah.
-You're a star, dog.

550
00:26:36,697 --> 00:26:38,032
- Wow.
- Thanks.

551
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:39,934
<i>When you arrive at Mavs,</i>

552
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:42,203
everyone on the jet skis
is greeting you

553
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:43,971
and they are like, "Go for
it." They encouraging.

554
00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,206
<i>You get into the lineup and,</i>

555
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:47,808
<i>and everyone is like cheering</i>
<i>each other on out there.</i>

556
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:48,577
<i>It's like this...</i>

557
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:49,643
<i>I guess</i>
<i>there's this, like,</i>

558
00:26:49,677 --> 00:26:51,946
<i>big wave brotherhood</i>
<i>out there, and all that.</i>

559
00:26:56,884 --> 00:26:58,018
It's such a rad
vibe, out there.

560
00:26:58,052 --> 00:26:59,353
I love surfing Mavericks.

561
00:27:02,857 --> 00:27:05,659
<i>Despite</i>
<i>the unique history</i>
<i>and welcoming vibe,</i>

562
00:27:05,693 --> 00:27:07,328
<i>Mavericks has a dark side.</i>

563
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:08,863
<i>Having taken the lives</i>

564
00:27:08,896 --> 00:27:11,465
<i>of two professional</i>
<i>big wave surfers,</i>

565
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,535
<i>Mark Foo, in 1994,</i>

566
00:27:13,568 --> 00:27:16,003
<i>and Sion Milosky in 2011.</i>

567
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:17,304
<i>And almost</i>

568
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:18,839
<i>the legendary,</i>
<i>Shane Dorian,</i>

569
00:27:18,873 --> 00:27:20,141
<i>couple of years later,</i>

570
00:27:20,174 --> 00:27:21,709
<i>after a vicious wipeout</i>

571
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:23,377
<i>and a two wave</i>
<i>hold down.</i>

572
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:28,949
<i>But for Matt and Torrey,</i>

573
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:30,951
<i>there are no such concerns,</i>

574
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:34,021
<i>as the swell they chased</i>
<i>is nowhere to be seen.</i>

575
00:27:37,024 --> 00:27:39,628
<i>Suddenly the</i>
<i>ocean is stirring,</i>

576
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,964
<i>and it looks like they may</i>
<i>have made the right call,</i>
<i>after all.</i>

577
00:27:43,998 --> 00:27:46,333
Suddenly we saw this
big explosion, like,

578
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:49,504
"Oh, we gotta get out there."

579
00:27:49,538 --> 00:27:51,939
<i>While Matt and</i>
<i>Torrey have surfed here</i>
<i>before,</i>

580
00:27:51,972 --> 00:27:54,275
<i>neither really has</i>
<i>the lay of the land.</i>

581
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:04,818
<i>Yeah. I mean, Torrey,</i>

582
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,187
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>how many times he's surfed.</i>

583
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,888
I think he surfed
Mavericks like twice.

584
00:28:07,922 --> 00:28:09,658
So, I've surfed there twice.

585
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,925
So I was following him,

586
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:12,426
but he didn't really know
what he was doing.

587
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:15,796
<i>I haven't done</i>
<i>in, like, three years,</i>

588
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,164
and I've only done it once.

589
00:28:17,198 --> 00:28:19,534
So...
And it was from the left.

590
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:21,168
But...

591
00:28:21,202 --> 00:28:22,770
<i>we'll find a way out.</i>

592
00:28:22,803 --> 00:28:25,507
<i>This guy's from South Africa,</i>
<i>dude, he'll find a way out.</i>

593
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:40,487
<i>Then we paddle out</i>
<i>around the left, out at Mavs,</i>

594
00:28:40,522 --> 00:28:42,456
<i>which is</i>
<i>quite a spectacular view,</i>

595
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:43,991
<i>because when you're</i>
<i>on the left,</i>

596
00:28:44,024 --> 00:28:46,093
<i>you're looking directly</i>
<i>into the slab</i>

597
00:28:46,126 --> 00:28:47,895
<i>and the left barrel's</i>
<i>coming towards you.</i>

598
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:49,196
<i>Just massive.</i>

599
00:28:57,706 --> 00:28:59,740
<i>We got out there</i>
<i>at, like, one o'clock</i>

600
00:28:59,773 --> 00:29:01,242
and was just bombing.

601
00:29:03,177 --> 00:29:05,846
<i>Pristine glass,</i>
<i>like, no wind at all.</i>

602
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,081
<i>Perfect conditions.</i>

603
00:29:07,114 --> 00:29:08,315
<i>This swell was</i>
<i>a lot bigger</i>

604
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:09,483
<i>than I thought</i>
<i>it was gonna be.</i>

605
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:11,418
<i>When I surfed</i>
<i>Mavericks of that size,</i>

606
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:13,521
<i>my main focus is,</i>
<i>is that left</i>

607
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:16,558
<i>because I think there's just</i>
<i>so much potential there.</i>

608
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:20,160
Now, you see, you know, no

609
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:21,195
human beings like us,

610
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:23,297
<i>going out there</i>
<i>and pushing our hardest to,</i>

611
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,499
<i>you know, overcome our fears.</i>

612
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:28,802
<i>When you see someone</i>
<i>really just super passionate</i>

613
00:29:28,836 --> 00:29:31,405
and not letting fear
take over,

614
00:29:31,438 --> 00:29:33,742
and just going at it,
you know, head down.

615
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:36,410
I think It's, uh,
it's a very motivating thing.

616
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,346
<i>Despite going out with dreams</i>

617
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,482
<i>of a big left slab barrel,</i>

618
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:44,418
<i>the ocean has its way of</i>
<i>determining how things go</i>

619
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:46,721
<i>and Torrey ends up front side.</i>

620
00:29:46,755 --> 00:29:47,888
<i>I remember just</i>

621
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:49,591
<i>doubling up super hard,</i>
<i>like, right on the peak.</i>

622
00:29:49,624 --> 00:29:51,325
I just whipped it
really fast and went.

623
00:29:51,358 --> 00:29:52,926
<i>And I remember</i>
<i>just kind of airdropping,</i>

624
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,596
<i>like, "Oh, man,"</i>

625
00:29:54,629 --> 00:29:55,764
"this...this is uh..."

626
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:57,766
"This isn't good.
I better stick this time."

627
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:07,408
<i>That was probably my best</i>
<i>wave,  I ended up being right,</i>

628
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:08,643
<i>which is kind of funny, it's</i>

629
00:30:08,677 --> 00:30:10,444
like a nice airdrop

630
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:13,414
<i>and ended up sticking it</i>
<i>and getting mowed down.</i>

631
00:30:13,447 --> 00:30:15,784
<i>And getting</i>
<i>pretty dang close to the</i>
<i>rocks</i>

632
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,051
<i>and on Mushroom Rock</i>

633
00:30:17,084 --> 00:30:18,553
<i>on the inside</i>
<i>and all that area.</i>

634
00:30:23,558 --> 00:30:25,527
<i>For Matt, in the past,</i>

635
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,262
<i>Mavericks has been</i>
<i>the best of times,</i>

636
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,264
<i>and the worst of times.</i>

637
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:31,533
<i>The last time</i>
<i>I was at Mavericks,</i>

638
00:30:31,566 --> 00:30:33,568
<i>I had one of the best waves</i>
<i>I've ever had,</i>

639
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,235
<i>and I had</i>
<i>all this confidence.</i>

640
00:30:47,081 --> 00:30:48,882
And then,
I paddled into this wave

641
00:30:48,916 --> 00:30:50,384
thinking, like, I've got this,

642
00:30:50,417 --> 00:30:51,985
<i>and the whole bottom</i>
<i>of the ocean</i>

643
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:53,120
<i>just seemed to fall away.</i>

644
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:54,756
<i>And I was just</i>
<i>pushed into the depths,</i>

645
00:30:54,789 --> 00:30:56,624
<i>one of the worst</i>
<i>beatings of my life.</i>

646
00:30:56,658 --> 00:30:59,293
And that was the last wave
I had out at Mavericks.

647
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:00,928
And now going
back out there,

648
00:31:00,961 --> 00:31:02,096
in the back of my mind,
I'm like,

649
00:31:02,129 --> 00:31:04,331
"Hey, the waves are beautiful
and they look friendly."

650
00:31:04,365 --> 00:31:06,033
But there's a chance that

651
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:07,702
you could have
the worst wipeout of your
life.

652
00:31:09,504 --> 00:31:12,139
My approach is always
to sit a little bit outside

653
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:14,942
and try to get
the biggest wave of the day.

654
00:31:14,975 --> 00:31:16,944
That's what
I'm out here to do.

655
00:31:16,977 --> 00:31:18,312
<i>This beautiful, big</i>

656
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:20,815
peak came in
and it just looked incredible.

657
00:31:24,284 --> 00:31:25,352
<i>When I was paddling into it,</i>

658
00:31:25,386 --> 00:31:27,354
<i>I was looking down,</i>
<i>and it looked like it was</i>

659
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,456
<i>too critical,</i>
<i>and getting too steep.</i>

660
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,126
But I just thought, like,
this is what I'm here for.

661
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,728
Just gotta send it.

662
00:31:33,762 --> 00:31:35,062
<i>I really believe that,</i>

663
00:31:35,095 --> 00:31:36,263
<i>challenges that are...</i>

664
00:31:36,296 --> 00:31:38,031
<i>The big challenges</i>
<i>are always scary.</i>

665
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:38,999
<i>But the bigger the challenge,</i>

666
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:40,467
<i>the more it's gonna</i>
<i>help you to grow.</i>

667
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:41,836
<i>Everyone has that fear</i>

668
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:43,237
<i>that's holding them back.</i>

669
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,773
<i>And you have to</i>
<i>face that fear.</i>

670
00:31:44,806 --> 00:31:47,040
<i>All the feelings</i>
<i>of vulnerability,</i>

671
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:48,909
<i>the anxieties,</i>
<i>it's all part of it.</i>

672
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:51,278
<i>And unless you face that,</i>
<i>and move through it,</i>

673
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:53,313
<i>you're going to remain</i>
<i>in the smaller world.</i>

674
00:31:56,684 --> 00:31:58,653
<i>But if you face it</i>
<i>and move through it,</i>

675
00:31:58,686 --> 00:32:00,454
<i>then you're gonna experience</i>
<i>some of the best things,</i>

676
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:01,790
<i>and you're gonna grow</i>
<i>as a human being,</i>

677
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,457
and you're going to be able
to surf that big wave.

678
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,392
That is your destiny.

679
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:10,397
<i>It's so often,</i>

680
00:32:10,431 --> 00:32:12,332
<i>I think on the other side</i>
<i>of that fear</i>

681
00:32:12,366 --> 00:32:14,536
<i>is where we experience</i>
<i>our best moments.</i>

682
00:32:19,908 --> 00:32:21,709
<i>A year later,</i>
<i>Matt has pushed past</i>

683
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:23,545
<i>the memory</i>
<i>of his heavy wipeout,</i>

684
00:32:23,578 --> 00:32:25,814
<i>and for a few minutes</i>
<i>he watches Torrey,</i>

685
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:27,749
<i>who is looking</i>
<i>for his dream wave.</i>

686
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,984
<i>Although Mavericks</i>
<i>is famous for its right,</i>

687
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:34,656
<i>the left represents</i>
<i>the next frontier of the wave.</i>

688
00:32:34,689 --> 00:32:37,859
<i>And Torrey sets the standard</i>
<i>with a deep one.</i>

689
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:41,028
<i>I got a few lefts</i>

690
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:42,931
and then one left
in particular.

691
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,933
That was like I
got a barrel on.

692
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,701
<i>It felt really, really fun.</i>

693
00:32:56,678 --> 00:32:59,012
<i>After an amazing first ride,</i>

694
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:00,515
<i>Matt is feeling invincible</i>

695
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:02,817
<i>and ready for another bomb.</i>

696
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:04,284
<i>This wave came</i>
<i>and moved under the pack</i>

697
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:05,285
<i>'cause it was a big double up.</i>

698
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:07,187
<i>I just thought, like,</i>
<i>"I could do this"</i>

699
00:33:07,221 --> 00:33:08,656
<i>and I put my head down.</i>

700
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,357
<i>And as I stood up at the top,</i>

701
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,326
<i>the bottom of the wave</i>
<i>just dropped too quickly,</i>

702
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:14,963
<i>and my board was,</i>
<i>was too long</i>

703
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:19,032
<i>and I nosedive and just,</i>
<i>like,  flung, catapulted me</i>

704
00:33:19,066 --> 00:33:20,702
<i>over the front of the board.</i>

705
00:33:20,735 --> 00:33:22,469
<i>It's this</i>
<i>weird silence before,</i>

706
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:23,872
<i>like the chaos</i>
<i>is about to start</i>

707
00:33:23,905 --> 00:33:27,107
<i>because you're just getting</i>
<i>pulled up and over in the</i>
<i>lip,</i>

708
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,843
<i>and then it took so long.</i>

709
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:32,312
<i>And then it was just the</i>
<i>impact  was so gnarly, and so</i>
<i>strong</i>

710
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:35,717
and just rattled
and pulled in all directions.

711
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,985
I ended up having to
pull my vest

712
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:39,353
<i>because I was getting pushed</i>
<i>super deep under the water.</i>

713
00:33:39,386 --> 00:33:41,388
Came up
and my board was in two
pieces,

714
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,323
I was like, "No."

715
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:44,526
<i>At most big wave spots,</i>

716
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:47,127
<i>the other surfers would smile</i>
<i>quietly to themselves</i>

717
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,030
<i>that a force in the lineup</i>
<i>has been sidelined.</i>

718
00:33:50,063 --> 00:33:51,465
<i>But luckily for Matt,</i>

719
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:53,768
<i>Mavericks'</i>
<i>special spirit reveals itself</i>

720
00:33:53,801 --> 00:33:56,336
<i>as local big wave legend,</i>
<i>Peter Mel,</i>

721
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:57,271
<i>who has ridden the biggest</i>

722
00:33:57,304 --> 00:33:59,641
<i>and best barrel</i>
<i>in the spot's history,</i>

723
00:33:59,674 --> 00:34:01,943
<i>offers to share</i>
<i>one of his backup boards.</i>

724
00:34:02,877 --> 00:34:04,378
<i>The waves</i>
<i>are pumping still</i>

725
00:34:04,411 --> 00:34:05,479
<i>and I've got a broken board.</i>

726
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:07,649
<i>So I went up to Pete</i>
<i>and he was on the jet ski,</i>

727
00:34:07,682 --> 00:34:10,384
watching his son
John, charging.

728
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:13,487
<i>I'm like, "Pete, please,</i>
<i>I really need</i>
<i>this backup board."</i>

729
00:34:13,521 --> 00:34:15,322
<i>Like, "Where is it?"</i>
<i>He's like, "Yeah, it's cool."</i>

730
00:34:15,355 --> 00:34:16,791
<i>"It's in the...</i>
<i>It's in my van."</i>

731
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:19,027
<i>Like, "Here,</i>
<i>this is where the key is."</i>

732
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,160
<i>And so he raced in.</i>

733
00:34:20,193 --> 00:34:22,362
<i>And thank you, Pete,</i>
<i>for bringing down the board.</i>

734
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,301
<i>Got the board, went back out</i>

735
00:34:27,334 --> 00:34:28,536
<i>and got a few more waves.</i>

736
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:32,406
<i>Such a nice day,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

737
00:34:32,439 --> 00:34:34,676
<i>We had, like, probably</i>
<i>three or four hour window,</i>

738
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,844
and then the wind
started whipping

739
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:39,714
and went straight on shore,
and it was done.

740
00:34:39,747 --> 00:34:41,749
<i>Definitely the best</i>
<i>big wave session</i>

741
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,851
<i>that I've had</i>
<i>this whole year by far.</i>

742
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:47,755
<i>Yeah, we called Curtis</i>
<i>right after and like,</i>

743
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,189
<i>"Dude, thank you</i>
<i>so much, man."</i>

744
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,261
<i>It may not</i>
<i>have been the biggest day</i>

745
00:34:54,294 --> 00:34:55,563
<i>in Mavs' history,</i>

746
00:34:55,597 --> 00:34:57,765
<i>but it was one of</i>
<i>the cleanest days</i>
<i>in a long time,</i>

747
00:34:57,799 --> 00:35:00,602
<i>making the red-eye trip,</i>
<i>the right call.</i>

748
00:35:02,937 --> 00:35:06,007
<i>72 hours,</i>
<i>after arriving in California,</i>

749
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,207
<i>the boys find themselves</i>

750
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,109
<i>heading straight</i>
<i>back to Hawaii.</i>

751
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,815
<i>And with Matt's time in Hawaii</i>
<i>starting to grow short,</i>

752
00:35:13,848 --> 00:35:16,884
<i>he's heartened by the news</i>
<i>of a possible fresh swell,</i>

753
00:35:16,918 --> 00:35:19,486
<i>but one surrounded by</i>
<i>question marks.</i>

754
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,823
<i>Such is the life</i>
<i>of a big wave surfer.</i>

755
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,391
I've got like
a week left before

756
00:35:24,424 --> 00:35:26,326
I have got to get
home to my family.

757
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,429
And this good looking
pulse of swell

758
00:35:29,463 --> 00:35:30,832
is coming
for the weekend.

759
00:35:30,865 --> 00:35:33,701
Everyone's saying it's gonna
be too small for Jaws.

760
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:35,036
<i>It's gonna be too windy.</i>

761
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:38,039
<i>I knew that</i>
<i>if there was a chance</i>

762
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:40,108
<i>that Jaws would be going,</i>
<i>then I needed to be out there.</i>

763
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,911
<i>I needed to spend as much</i>
<i>time  out at Jaws as possible.</i>

764
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,312
<i>And if there's</i>
<i>anything happening,</i>

765
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:46,748
<i>I've gotta be out there.</i>

766
00:35:47,414 --> 00:35:48,850
Matt was just frothing to go.

767
00:35:48,883 --> 00:35:50,852
He's like, "I just... I'm
going to go, no matter what."

768
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:52,654
And I was like, "I don't know
if I'm going to go, man."

769
00:35:52,687 --> 00:35:53,554
I think it's going to be bad.

770
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:55,023
<i>I think it will be</i>
<i>windy and small.</i>

771
00:35:56,024 --> 00:35:58,626
And I was like, "Torrey,
I'm going to Jaws, bro.

772
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:00,528
"Just come with me.
Let's do it."

773
00:36:00,561 --> 00:36:01,696
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"Well, all right,</i>

774
00:36:01,729 --> 00:36:03,731
<i>"well, let's just do it."</i>
<i>I don't know. Who knows?</i>

775
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:05,432
<i>Maybe there'll be</i>
<i>a couple at Jaws.</i>

776
00:36:21,516 --> 00:36:23,183
Yeah, this looks...

777
00:36:23,216 --> 00:36:26,486
It doesn't look like
there's any action, really.

778
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,157
When we arrived,
it looked like it was dead
flat.

779
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,659
And I was like,
"Oh my gosh, we have blown
it."

780
00:36:31,693 --> 00:36:34,394
I was ready in my
inflation suit, ready to go.

781
00:36:34,428 --> 00:36:35,730
There were no waves.

782
00:36:35,763 --> 00:36:37,665
Somebody was on the cliff.

783
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:38,800
Had been there for a while.

784
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,467
<i>He said</i>
<i>he hasn't seen any waves.</i>

785
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:42,904
The swell
hasn't arrived.

786
00:36:42,937 --> 00:36:44,471
<i>Things don't look good.</i>

787
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:47,809
<i>But in a replay of Mavericks,</i>

788
00:36:47,842 --> 00:36:50,645
<i>things suddenly</i>
<i>start to shift.</i>

789
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:52,513
<i>One of the really</i>
<i>cool things about Jaws is</i>

790
00:36:52,547 --> 00:36:54,414
<i>when the...</i>
<i>When the sets approaches,</i>

791
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:56,517
<i>the lines stack up</i>
<i>from the horizon.</i>

792
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,619
You just see,
looks like corduroy lines.

793
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:00,121
They like, stack up big

794
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:05,425
<i>These lines just started,</i>
<i>like marching,</i>

795
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:07,260
<i>and they just unloaded</i>
<i>and, like</i>

796
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:08,696
<i>barreled across the reef.</i>

797
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:11,699
Oh my gosh, it's on.

798
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:12,600
<i>I was ready in my suit.</i>

799
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:14,401
<i>I just started</i>
<i>running down the cliff,</i>

800
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:16,137
<i>Torrey started</i>
<i>getting ready.</i>

801
00:37:31,152 --> 00:37:33,187
<i>One of the most</i>
<i>terrifying things about Jaws</i>

802
00:37:33,221 --> 00:37:34,555
<i>is the rock jump.</i>

803
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:37,191
<i>Uh, it's these boulders</i>
<i>down there, that are</i>
<i>getting rolled</i>

804
00:37:37,225 --> 00:37:39,193
<i>by these surging waves.</i>

805
00:37:39,227 --> 00:37:41,662
There's a massive shore break
that's exploding on the rocks,

806
00:37:41,696 --> 00:37:43,664
and you've got to
try to time it.

807
00:37:43,698 --> 00:37:44,732
<i>When there's no sets,</i>

808
00:37:44,766 --> 00:37:45,833
<i>you've got to punch through</i>
<i>this shore break</i>

809
00:37:45,867 --> 00:37:48,669
<i>and get into the deep water,</i>
<i>into the channel.</i>

810
00:37:48,703 --> 00:37:49,637
<i>But if you time it wrong,</i>

811
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,539
<i>you're getting slammed</i>
<i>back on the rocks.</i>

812
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:02,683
<i>Got through the shore break</i>

813
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:04,085
<i>and I got out</i>
<i>into the lineup.</i>

814
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:16,063
<i>My strategy was, kind of,</i>

815
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:18,666
<i>to just wait</i>
<i>for one really good one.</i>

816
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,367
Try not to sit too close in

817
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,536
because it felt like
there might be

818
00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:23,538
a few bigger ones
breaking further out.

819
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,707
<i>I looked over the edge,</i>
<i>and it was steep,</i>

820
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:28,308
<i>and I pulled back,</i>
<i>and I had about</i>

821
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:29,442
<i>four or five, I was like,</i>

822
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:30,745
<i>"Damn, should have gone</i>
<i>in that wave."</i>

823
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:32,379
<i>Like, "That was a good one."</i>

824
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:33,313
<i>Just kept pulling back.</i>

825
00:38:33,346 --> 00:38:34,682
And then I saw this wave.

826
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:36,684
I was like, "I'm going
on this thing, no matter
what."

827
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:44,025
<i>As the wave picks me up,</i>
<i>I'm still with the thought...</i>

828
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,393
<i>I'm still trying to claw my</i>
<i>way  down the wave face,</i>

829
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:48,229
<i>even though it's getting</i>
<i>more and more vertical.</i>

830
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:52,934
<i>I jumped up and went down.</i>

831
00:38:52,967 --> 00:38:55,203
<i>And as I was going down,</i>
<i>I was just suddenly like,</i>

832
00:38:55,236 --> 00:38:58,172
<i>"Wow, This wave is so windy,</i>
<i>and so choppy."</i>

833
00:38:58,206 --> 00:38:59,807
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>trying to balance</i>

834
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,742
<i>going over</i>
<i>these big wind chops.</i>

835
00:39:01,776 --> 00:39:03,778
<i>At the same time, I was trying</i>
<i>to get my line going,</i>

836
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:05,580
<i>because the wave</i>
<i>is going down the line.</i>

837
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:08,348
<i>If the wave is running,</i>
<i>there's this big wall</i>
<i>ahead of me.</i>

838
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:13,888
<i>As I was bottom-turning,</i>
<i>I could see the lip</i>
<i>already starting to fall.</i>

839
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,257
The only way I'm gonna make
this wave is to get under
the core.

840
00:39:26,267 --> 00:39:29,402
<i>And I just pumped up enough</i>
<i>under the roof of it,</i>

841
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:34,075
<i>and, then, I was, like,</i>
<i>in the bowl of this,</i>
<i>like, beautiful, big wave.</i>

842
00:39:34,108 --> 00:39:37,111
<i>And then I came through</i>
<i>and down and made it</i>
<i>into the channel.</i>

843
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,679
I was, like, "Phew."

844
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:40,781
Stoked.

845
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,187
<i>Every now and then,</i>
<i>the sets would come in</i>
<i>from the west,</i>

846
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,155
and I could see, like,
way down the line

847
00:39:48,189 --> 00:39:51,025
<i>up these big walls</i>
<i>wrapping into it,</i>

848
00:39:51,058 --> 00:39:54,328
where Torrey was,
and I could just see him
spinning and going.

849
00:39:57,665 --> 00:40:01,736
<i>When Jaws is big</i>
<i>and windy, it's literally</i>
<i>almost impossible</i>

850
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:03,671
<i>to paddle into</i>
<i>a really big wave.</i>

851
00:40:14,481 --> 00:40:15,850
Got a couple of good waves,

852
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:18,418
<i>and it was actually better</i>
<i>than I thought</i>
<i>it was going to be.</i>

853
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:19,987
<i>So that was really nice.</i>

854
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:26,227
<i>The fabled Maui</i>
<i>winds start blowing even</i>
<i>harder,</i>

855
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,930
<i>and the wiser course of action</i>
<i>is to exit.</i>

856
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:32,233
<i>But Matt decides</i>
<i>he wants one more.</i>

857
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:35,269
<i>We had a few great</i>
<i>windy waves</i>
<i>out of, uh, Jaws.</i>

858
00:40:35,303 --> 00:40:37,872
<i>I kind of... I felt like I</i>
<i>was  really getting in the</i>
<i>zone.</i>

859
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:40,675
<i>And, then, I tried to send it</i>
<i>on a pretty big one</i>
<i>out the back.</i>

860
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:45,379
<i>And, as I was going down</i>
<i>the wave face,</i>
<i>the chops were just so</i>
<i>intense.</i>

861
00:40:54,555 --> 00:40:58,592
Just bucked me off my board
and I had, like,
a pretty gnarly beatdown.

862
00:40:58,626 --> 00:41:02,296
<i>I got up again</i>
<i>over the fall, sent deep,</i>
<i>I pulled my vest.</i>

863
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:06,033
<i>The water safety guy</i>
<i>we had organized,</i>
<i>he came in and got me.</i>

864
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:10,037
<i>The wind-whipped</i>
<i>wipeout puts a period</i>

865
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,306
<i>on the Jaws session</i>
<i>for Matt and Torrey.</i>

866
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:19,914
<i>But, for Kai Lenny,</i>
<i>homebound on Maui</i>
<i>with his newborn twins,</i>

867
00:41:19,947 --> 00:41:22,683
<i>it gives him a moment</i>
<i>to reflect on big wave riding</i>

868
00:41:22,717 --> 00:41:27,288
<i>and, then, head out</i>
<i>and grab the tow rope</i>
<i>for a solo expression session.</i>

869
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:31,726
<i>I have so much</i>
<i>that I wanted to accomplish</i>
<i>in big waves,</i>

870
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:34,128
and what better place
but in my backyard?

871
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:38,733
<i>Really, the scariest thing</i>
<i>about riding a big wave,</i>

872
00:41:38,766 --> 00:41:43,671
<i>and just as, as life is,</i>
<i>you know, it's fear</i>
<i>of the unknown.</i>

873
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:46,140
<i>In order to overcome fear,</i>
<i>you have to be able to face</i>
<i>it,</i>

874
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:48,943
<i>and there's just, really,</i>
<i>no other way to get around it.</i>

875
00:41:48,976 --> 00:41:52,513
<i>But facing it is, oftentimes,</i>
<i>less scary</i>

876
00:41:52,546 --> 00:41:55,816
than just thinking about it,
or leading up to it.

877
00:42:05,426 --> 00:42:10,197
<i>Fear is, I think,</i>
<i>the emotion that gets</i>
<i>the worst rap.</i>

878
00:42:10,231 --> 00:42:13,367
<i>But, at the same time,</i>
<i>it's the most powerful</i>
<i>emotion.</i>

879
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:16,871
<i>It's actually what helps you</i>
<i>survive and overcome.</i>

880
00:42:19,907 --> 00:42:21,675
<i>'Cause it's not conscious,</i>
<i>in a way.</i>

881
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:22,977
<i>It's almost</i>
<i>a subconscious thing,</i>

882
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,846
<i>and it's about honing in</i>
<i>that fear</i>

883
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,848
<i>and channeling it</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

884
00:42:27,882 --> 00:42:29,316
<i>You can let it eat you up,</i>

885
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,987
<i>or you can let it take you</i>
<i>to the highest of places.</i>

886
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:49,603
<i>When you're on the wave,</i>
<i>everything goes quiet.</i>

887
00:42:49,637 --> 00:42:52,973
<i>You're at, probably,</i>
<i>in that moment,</i>
<i>the loudest place on earth.</i>

888
00:42:53,007 --> 00:42:54,175
<i>Waves are exploding.</i>

889
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:57,512
<i>People are screaming</i>
<i>on the cliff.</i>

890
00:42:57,546 --> 00:43:01,649
<i>All of sudden,</i>
<i>it's just pure quiet,</i>
<i>and it's this blissfulness.</i>

891
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:18,032
<i>While Kai slips in</i>
<i>sessions between diaper duty</i>

892
00:43:18,065 --> 00:43:20,134
<i>for Matt and Torrey,</i>
<i>it's another flight.</i>

893
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,003
<i>This time, back to Oahu,</i>

894
00:43:23,037 --> 00:43:25,639
<i>where a new swell</i>
<i>promises to bring</i>

895
00:43:25,673 --> 00:43:29,443
<i>what might be</i>
<i>the most dangerous wave</i>
<i>on Earth to life,</i>

896
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,045
<i>Pipeline.</i>

897
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:37,751
<i>One thing is for sure,</i>
<i>the vibe will not be</i>

898
00:43:37,785 --> 00:43:39,554
<i>the welcoming community</i>
<i>at Mavericks,</i>

899
00:43:39,588 --> 00:43:43,757
<i>or the nearly empty,</i>
<i>windblown lineup at Jaws.</i>

900
00:43:43,791 --> 00:43:46,494
<i>Torrey enjoys</i>
<i>heavy local status</i>
<i>to help him get waves</i>

901
00:43:46,528 --> 00:43:49,430
<i>in this cutthroat</i>
<i>competitive arena,</i>

902
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:53,434
<i>but Matt is gonna</i>
<i>have to play politics</i>
<i>to get his.</i>

903
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,436
<i>If you take</i>
<i>the wrong wave out there,</i>

904
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:57,404
<i>if you drop in</i>
<i>on the wrong person,</i>

905
00:43:57,438 --> 00:44:00,609
even looking at the wrong
wave, you can get beaten up.
You can get sent in.

906
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,514
<i>Pipeline may not</i>
<i>break the biggest,</i>

907
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:08,182
<i>but if you measure waves</i>
<i>in increments of fear,</i>

908
00:44:08,215 --> 00:44:10,117
<i>it's at the top of the chain,</i>

909
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:14,388
<i>having claimed many lives</i>
<i>on the shallow lava reef.</i>

910
00:44:14,421 --> 00:44:17,958
I feel like in a wave like
Jaws, you can prepare
for the hold-down.

911
00:44:17,992 --> 00:44:19,528
You're in deep water.

912
00:44:19,561 --> 00:44:21,862
<i>When that wave crashes</i>
<i>over you, it's pushing you</i>
<i>down  into the depths,</i>

913
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:24,465
<i>which is most people's</i>
<i>worst nightmare.</i>

914
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:28,035
<i>But, if you're prepared</i>
<i>for that hold-down,</i>
<i>you're gonna survive it,</i>

915
00:44:28,068 --> 00:44:30,171
whereas, if you go to a wave
like Pipeline,

916
00:44:30,204 --> 00:44:32,106
sure, it's, like,
a lot smaller,

917
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:34,275
<i>but it's breaking</i>
<i>in extremely shallow,</i>

918
00:44:34,308 --> 00:44:36,243
<i>uh, over shallow lava rock.</i>

919
00:44:36,277 --> 00:44:39,880
<i>And you can do everything</i>
<i>in your control to be safe</i>

920
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:42,183
and to try to catch
the right wave,

921
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:45,853
<i>but that wave is slamming you</i>
<i>into the reef, if you're in</i>
<i>the wrong place.</i>

922
00:44:45,886 --> 00:44:49,723
<i>There's so much energy</i>
<i>that's converging</i>
<i>into a very small area.</i>

923
00:44:49,757 --> 00:44:53,060
<i>The reef is very uneven,</i>
<i>making the wave walk,</i>
<i>and refract,</i>

924
00:44:53,093 --> 00:44:56,430
<i>and change</i>
<i>in different directions.</i>
<i>It's extremely unpredictable.</i>

925
00:44:56,463 --> 00:44:58,966
<i>And, if you fall</i>
<i>in the wrong place,</i>

926
00:44:58,999 --> 00:45:01,101
<i>that wave is driving you</i>
<i>so hard into the reef.</i>

927
00:45:01,135 --> 00:45:05,372
<i>So no amount of preparation</i>
<i>can really help you to</i>

928
00:45:06,473 --> 00:45:07,841
<i>be safer out there.</i>

929
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,544
<i>If you go on the wrong wave,</i>
<i>and it pushes you</i>
<i>into the reef,</i>

930
00:45:09,578 --> 00:45:11,011
<i>you're gonna be</i>
<i>in serious trouble.</i>

931
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:14,683
<i>If you're going head first,</i>
<i>you can get knocked out</i>
<i>unconscious,</i>

932
00:45:14,715 --> 00:45:16,551
<i>like, very, very easily.</i>

933
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:18,919
<i>Pipeline is definitely</i>
<i>the most dangerous wave</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

934
00:45:18,953 --> 00:45:23,558
And I feel just as much fear
out of Pipeline that I do
surfing a wave like Jaws.

935
00:45:49,684 --> 00:45:52,786
<i>For Matt,</i>
<i>this is a uniquely</i>
<i>challenging spot,</i>

936
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,958
<i>dealing with a combination</i>
<i>of danger, and hunting</i>
<i>for a wave amongst the</i>
<i>locals.</i>

937
00:45:57,992 --> 00:46:00,894
<i>It was a little bit</i>
<i>of an uphill battle,</i>
<i>again, in the crowd.</i>

938
00:46:00,928 --> 00:46:05,567
<i>The waves were really good,</i>
<i>but it was a struggle</i>
<i>to get waves.</i>

939
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:13,040
When you surf a wave
that's that intense,
time slows down.

940
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:15,209
<i>All your senses come alive.</i>

941
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:17,712
<i>Everything is intensified</i>
<i>from when you're paddling</i>
<i>into the wave,</i>

942
00:46:17,746 --> 00:46:20,214
<i>you're looking over the edge</i>
<i>and it's past vertical,</i>

943
00:46:20,247 --> 00:46:22,116
<i>and you can see the water</i>
<i>sucking off the reef,</i>

944
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:23,917
<i>the bottom of the wave</i>
<i>drops away, and the,</i>

945
00:46:23,951 --> 00:46:28,623
<i>and the top just curls over,</i>
<i>making this huge room</i>
<i>that you're inside of.</i>

946
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:33,628
<i>Only have, like,</i>
<i>two or three seconds</i>
<i>inside that chamber,</i>

947
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:35,362
<i>but it feels...</i>
<i>It's one of the best feelings</i>

948
00:46:35,396 --> 00:46:37,164
<i>you can have</i>
<i>in the whole world.</i>

949
00:46:37,197 --> 00:46:40,367
<i>Looking for</i>
<i>a classic Pipe left,</i>
<i>battling the crowd,</i>

950
00:46:40,401 --> 00:46:43,137
<i>and knowing the hungry reef</i>
<i>is waiting underneath,</i>

951
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:47,808
<i>Matt finds himself</i>
<i>dealing with some unusual</i>
<i>crosstown traffic.</i>

952
00:46:47,841 --> 00:46:50,679
As I was paddling,
I was shouting
all the crew off down the
line.

953
00:46:50,712 --> 00:46:52,913
"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm going! I'm going!"

954
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:55,750
<i>And it's really steep,</i>
<i>so you, kind of,</i>
<i>have to be focused</i>

955
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:57,084
<i>on, like, on your take off.</i>

956
00:46:57,117 --> 00:46:59,253
But, out the corner
of my eye, I could see
this bodyboarder.

957
00:46:59,286 --> 00:47:01,188
He was looking very interested
in my wave.

958
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:05,025
<i>As I'm dropping in,</i>
<i>I see out the corner</i>
<i>of my eye, he's going.</i>

959
00:47:05,059 --> 00:47:06,093
<i>And I was, like, "Whoa!"</i>

960
00:47:06,126 --> 00:47:07,629
<i>I shouted, "Whoa, whoa!"</i>

961
00:47:07,662 --> 00:47:10,164
I pulled up into this
big barrel behind him.

962
00:47:10,197 --> 00:47:14,301
<i>He, like, almost aired over</i>
<i>me,  and I, I rode through</i>
<i>his foam trail</i>

963
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:16,805
<i>and, then,</i>
<i>was in this beautiful,</i>
<i>big barrel.</i>

964
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:20,240
<i>And he was riding</i>
<i>in front of it,</i>
<i>just in front of me.</i>

965
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:23,611
<i>I shot out of the barrel</i>
<i>and he was trying</i>
<i>to turn off the wave.</i>

966
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:25,446
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>he'd even seen me.</i>

967
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:31,619
I was, like, "Oh, at least
we both made the wave.
We were safe."

968
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:35,222
<i>And, then,</i>
<i>some of the photographers,</i>
<i>they were, like,</i>

969
00:47:35,255 --> 00:47:39,226
"Hey, dude,
that was so dangerous, man."
And, then, they sent him in.

970
00:47:39,259 --> 00:47:42,630
So, on my behalf,
he got sent in.

971
00:47:42,664 --> 00:47:46,568
<i>While localism</i>
<i>has its downsides,</i>
<i>sometimes, harsh crowd control</i>

972
00:47:46,601 --> 00:47:50,772
<i>also provides safety</i>
<i>in life-threatening</i>
<i>situations.</i>

973
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,146
<i>Pipeline's the left,</i>
<i>Backdoor's the right.</i>

974
00:47:59,179 --> 00:48:03,951
<i>And, my whole life,</i>
<i>I've always been obsessed</i>
<i>with Backdoor.</i>

975
00:48:03,984 --> 00:48:05,452
<i>It depends on who you ask.</i>

976
00:48:05,486 --> 00:48:08,623
<i>A lot of people will tell you</i>
<i>it's sketchier than Pipe.</i>

977
00:48:08,656 --> 00:48:09,858
<i>Maybe not as perfect.</i>

978
00:48:18,232 --> 00:48:20,869
<i>For me, I would say,</i>
<i>it's more of a challenge.</i>

979
00:48:47,327 --> 00:48:49,296
<i>I don't know if I'd call</i>
<i>myself  a heavy local.</i>

980
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:54,669
<i>I think I just...</i>
<i>I'm super passionate</i>
<i>about the wave that I want.</i>

981
00:48:54,702 --> 00:48:58,138
<i>I think the wave that I want</i>
<i>is this really big,</i>
<i>doubled-up thing</i>

982
00:48:58,172 --> 00:49:00,542
<i>that doesn't look like</i>
<i>the best wave,</i>

983
00:49:00,575 --> 00:49:04,344
<i>and, as soon as</i>
<i>you second-guess it,</i>
<i>it's, kind of, gone.</i>

984
00:49:17,424 --> 00:49:19,159
<i>Consistently being good,</i>
<i>day after day,</i>

985
00:49:19,193 --> 00:49:23,330
<i>I would say, this is</i>
<i>one of the best years</i>
<i>I've seen in the Pipeline.</i>

986
00:49:29,336 --> 00:49:31,405
<i>It was really nice</i>
<i>to travel with Bromley.</i>

987
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:33,240
<i>That was definitely one</i>
<i>of my highlights of the year,</i>

988
00:49:33,273 --> 00:49:35,142
<i>was going on some surf trips</i>
<i>with him,</i>

989
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:38,947
<i>and just have some good times</i>
<i>with him, and get him hooked</i>
<i>on country music, you know?</i>

990
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,381
I appreciate that.

991
00:49:44,017 --> 00:49:47,221
All we listened to, all day,
everyday in his car
was Western music,

992
00:49:47,254 --> 00:49:49,591
and I don't really like
Western music.

993
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:54,394
Torrey is one of the most
polite and humble surfers that
I know.

994
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:56,196
He's such a nice guy.

995
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,967
And one of the reasons
why I just love cruising
with him, we get on super
well.

996
00:49:58,999 --> 00:50:01,268
Chasing the swell together
was the first time we, like,

997
00:50:01,301 --> 00:50:04,906
properly connected,
and got to hang out, like,
day after day.

998
00:50:04,939 --> 00:50:08,676
<i>And he's such a legend</i>
<i>and he's an incredible</i>
<i>surfer.</i>

999
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:15,984
<i>For Matt, it was</i>
<i>time to head back home</i>
<i>to his family in South Africa.</i>

1000
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:20,822
<i>I can't wait</i>
<i>to get home to my baby</i>
<i>and to my wife, and</i>

1001
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:23,490
<i>yeah, reset and get ready</i>
<i>for the next swell.</i>

1002
00:50:28,863 --> 00:50:30,598
<i>At Pipeline,</i>
<i>one of the locals</i>

1003
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:34,002
<i>who usually gets the waves</i>
<i>he wants, is Makua Rothman,</i>

1004
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:36,336
<i>who grew up on</i>
<i>the North Shore.</i>

1005
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:40,073
<i>But where he really made</i>
<i>his mark is back at Jaws</i>
<i>on Maui,</i>

1006
00:50:40,107 --> 00:50:44,044
<i>having launched his career</i>
<i>in 2003 as a 17-year-old,</i>

1007
00:50:44,077 --> 00:50:48,750
<i>winning the XXL Big Wave</i>
<i>awards  with a 66-foot ride.</i>

1008
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:53,521
<i>And then, last year,</i>
<i>topping that</i>
<i>by getting towed into</i>

1009
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:55,957
<i>one of the largest waves</i>
<i>ever ridden.</i>

1010
00:50:58,458 --> 00:51:01,295
<i>Some say the face</i>
<i>approached 100 feet,</i>

1011
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:02,931
<i>though he's not claiming it,</i>
<i>and only says,</i>

1012
00:51:02,964 --> 00:51:06,601
<i>"Let the ride and wave</i>
<i>speak for themselves."</i>

1013
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:12,907
<i>This season,</i>
<i>while certainly not</i>
<i>hanging up his trunks,</i>

1014
00:51:12,941 --> 00:51:18,846
<i>Makua decided to run</i>
<i>for City Council</i>
<i>and put his focus on</i>
<i>politics.</i>

1015
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,584
<i>But he's also about</i>
<i>keeping the spirit of Aloha</i>
<i>alive globally,</i>

1016
00:51:22,617 --> 00:51:24,886
<i>which led him</i>
<i>to an extraordinary</i>
<i>surf session</i>

1017
00:51:24,919 --> 00:51:27,789
<i>about as far away</i>
<i>as you can get from big waves.</i>

1018
00:51:34,361 --> 00:51:36,163
<i>A wave pool in Austin, Texas,</i>

1019
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:39,601
<i>sharing the stoke</i>
<i>with two champions</i>
<i>of other sports.</i>

1020
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:43,938
<i>Honestly,</i>
<i>when I surf here</i>
<i>and I catch a wave,</i>

1021
00:51:43,972 --> 00:51:47,809
I don't think
that I am in a pool
in the middle of Waco, Texas.

1022
00:51:47,842 --> 00:51:50,044
<i>I'm on a wave surfing,</i>
<i>regardless of what it is.</i>

1023
00:51:50,078 --> 00:51:54,381
<i>And, you know, technology</i>
<i>has, you know, given all of us</i>

1024
00:51:54,414 --> 00:51:57,952
<i>the ability to surf, you know,</i>
<i>anywhere on Planet Earth now.</i>

1025
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:03,958
<i>Once you get on that wave,</i>
<i>you're not thinking</i>
<i>you're in a pool, right?</i>

1026
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:05,727
<i>You're on a wave</i>
<i>getting barreled.</i>

1027
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,127
<i>It's like you're at Uluwatu</i>
<i>or whatever.</i>

1028
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,496
- I think, it's also the people
you're around as well.
Yes.

1029
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:12,900
Yeah, the camaraderie,
like, the, the group
you bring to the pool, as
well.

1030
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:14,769
-Yes.
-You know,
people you've come with.

1031
00:52:14,802 --> 00:52:16,169
The, the, the,

1032
00:52:16,203 --> 00:52:18,840
you know, you've always
gotta surround yourself
with good people.

1033
00:52:20,975 --> 00:52:24,444
<i>Makua threw down</i>
<i>a super fun session</i>
<i>at BSR's wave pool</i>

1034
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:28,049
<i>with none other</i>
<i>than Formula One</i>
<i>seven-time world champion,</i>

1035
00:52:28,082 --> 00:52:29,550
<i>Lewis Hamilton,</i>

1036
00:52:29,584 --> 00:52:32,587
<i>and four-time Supercross</i>
<i>motocross title holder,</i>
<i>Dylan Ferrandis,</i>

1037
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:37,058
<i>a fun break from politics</i>
<i>and the even harsher realities</i>
<i>of big waves.</i>

1038
00:52:39,594 --> 00:52:41,896
<i>Oh, Lewis</i>
<i>was charging today.</i>

1039
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:45,867
He was, uh, stepping it up
to the next level.
They both were.

1040
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,206
<i>It doesn't matter what I did</i>
<i>in this pool.</i>

1041
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,877
Like, I could have done
a move I've never done before,

1042
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:58,079
and it wouldn't make me
as happy as watching
you two guys

1043
00:52:58,112 --> 00:53:00,715
come out of the barrel
with your hands up,
"Yeah!"

1044
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:02,083
Like, that's what makes me
feel good.

1045
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:04,686
<i>That's the kind of stuff</i>
<i>that I really enjoy</i>
<i>about surfing,</i>

1046
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:07,287
<i>because I know that surfing</i>
<i>can bring the world together.</i>

1047
00:53:16,698 --> 00:53:18,265
<i>While</i>
<i>the North Shore pumps,</i>

1048
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:20,835
<i>Bianca Valenti charges</i>
<i>an outer reef.</i>

1049
00:53:20,868 --> 00:53:24,138
<i>She is among the elite</i>
<i>of the growing number</i>
<i>of women worldwide</i>

1050
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:25,940
<i>taking on big waves,</i>

1051
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,843
<i>joining the ranks of the</i>
<i>likes  of Keala Kennelly,</i>

1052
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,344
<i>who has never found a drop</i>
<i>she won't attempt,</i>

1053
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:35,149
<i>and Justine Dupont,</i>
<i>who made history</i>
<i>at Jaws last winter</i>

1054
00:53:35,183 --> 00:53:37,350
<i>with an epic barrel.</i>

1055
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,555
<i>But her home break</i>
<i>is the fabled</i>
<i>and feared Mavericks.</i>

1056
00:53:42,857 --> 00:53:45,159
<i>An extension of the embracing</i>
<i>nature of Mavericks</i>

1057
00:53:45,193 --> 00:53:47,829
<i>is how women have become</i>
<i>accepted in the lineup.</i>

1058
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:49,130
<i>It wasn't always this way,</i>

1059
00:53:49,163 --> 00:53:52,365
<i> going back to the pioneering</i>
<i> female surfer, Sarah</i>
<i>Gerhardt,</i>

1060
00:53:52,399 --> 00:53:55,169
<i>the first female</i>
<i>to charge the wave.</i>

1061
00:53:55,203 --> 00:54:00,541
I was born in LA
and, then, grew up
in Dana Point.

1062
00:54:00,575 --> 00:54:04,478
<i>Learned how to surf</i>
<i>at Doheny Beach there</i>
<i>when I was seven.</i>

1063
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:10,017
Then, I got into big waves
at UC Santa Barbara.

1064
00:54:10,051 --> 00:54:14,655
I decided I wanted to live
in San Francisco
after I graduated.

1065
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:20,828
<i>Started surfing Mavericks.</i>
<i>The first time I surfed,</i>
<i>it was in 2012.</i>

1066
00:54:23,865 --> 00:54:27,201
Every single time,
there's a really special day
out there.

1067
00:54:27,235 --> 00:54:30,138
<i>I want to be out there.</i>
<i>I want to be fully present,</i>
<i>fully ready,</i>

1068
00:54:30,171 --> 00:54:31,739
<i>because every single second,</i>

1069
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:34,142
<i>every single wave,</i>
<i>every single session out</i>
<i>there,</i>

1070
00:54:34,175 --> 00:54:36,844
<i>it's so amazing, and</i>
<i>different,  and special.</i>

1071
00:54:38,846 --> 00:54:40,615
<i>You know, you have</i>
<i>these experiences</i>

1072
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:44,218
<i>where you see your life</i>
<i>flash before your eyes.</i>

1073
00:54:44,252 --> 00:54:49,190
<i>It's an amazing place</i>
<i>where you can learn</i>
<i>a lot about yourself.</i>

1074
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:51,526
Mavericks Surf Awards
was a super fun event.

1075
00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,964
I think, like, 300 or 400
people showed up at Old
Princeton Landing the other
night.

1076
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:59,901
There was just a lot of love,
and it's so nice
to come together

1077
00:54:59,934 --> 00:55:02,170
with community,
in celebration of the wave,

1078
00:55:02,203 --> 00:55:04,806
<i>because it is</i>
<i>such a special place.</i>

1079
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,240
<i>There were</i>
<i>three men's categories,</i>

1080
00:55:06,274 --> 00:55:09,376
<i>three women's categories,</i>
<i>equal prize money.</i>

1081
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:13,514
<i>Winning three awards,</i>
<i>actually,  yeah, that was</i>
<i>pretty cool  to get, you know,</i>

1082
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:16,184
<i>acknowledgement for all that</i>
<i>hard work.</i>

1083
00:55:22,857 --> 00:55:25,593
<i>Today,</i>
<i>Bianca finds herself</i>
<i>in the lineup,</i>

1084
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:28,796
<i>having earned the ultimate</i>
<i>compliment, respect.</i>

1085
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:31,732
<i>And she gets her waves</i>
<i>and has built a life and</i>
<i>career</i>

1086
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:34,401
<i>as a pioneering female</i>
<i>big wave surfer.</i>

1087
00:55:34,434 --> 00:55:37,638
<i>So awesome,</i>
<i>this season, seeing more women</i>
<i>in the water,</i>

1088
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:39,574
<i>especially in Hawaii,</i>
<i>and here, too,</i>

1089
00:55:39,607 --> 00:55:42,677
and to have the guys
cheering us on so much.

1090
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,012
<i>It's been fun</i>
<i>to be a part of this,</i>

1091
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:48,182
<i>this movement that really has</i>
<i>so much momentum right now.</i>

1092
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,690
<i>With his surf buddy,</i>
<i>Matt Bromley, gone,</i>

1093
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:57,291
<i>and the waves looking flat,</i>

1094
00:55:57,325 --> 00:55:59,827
<i>Torrey has another way</i>
<i>to get his required dose</i>
<i>of adrenaline</i>

1095
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:01,361
<i>outside of the ocean.</i>

1096
00:56:06,734 --> 00:56:10,338
<i>Something that I do</i>
<i>on the side to, kind of,</i>
<i>get the adrenaline rush</i>

1097
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:11,873
<i>is pit bull riding.</i>

1098
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:16,476
<i>My whole family's</i>
<i>from Texas, so,</i>

1099
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:21,916
<i>I don't know, I kind of grew</i>
<i>up  watching the PBR</i>
<i>and been super in love with,</i>

1100
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:25,987
<i>you know, country music</i>
<i>and the western way of life.</i>

1101
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,555
<i>Surfing</i>
<i>and big wave riding</i>

1102
00:56:27,588 --> 00:56:29,924
<i>may be part of the fabric</i>
<i>of Hawaii,</i>

1103
00:56:29,957 --> 00:56:34,328
<i>but it also has 150 years</i>
<i>of history of Hawaiian</i>
<i>cowboys.</i>

1104
00:56:34,362 --> 00:56:37,365
<i>They call them paniolos.</i>

1105
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:40,902
They have, like,
a really cool rodeo scene
over here in Hawaii.

1106
00:56:42,703 --> 00:56:45,773
<i>For me, I think, it's kind of</i>
<i>the coolest,</i>
<i>the best of both worlds,</i>

1107
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:48,943
<i>'cause you got, you know,</i>
<i>some of the best surf</i>
<i>in the world,</i>

1108
00:56:48,976 --> 00:56:51,279
<i>and, then, you can go get on</i>
<i>some horses and bulls, too.</i>

1109
00:56:51,312 --> 00:56:54,148
<i>So it's really special</i>
<i>that we have that in Hawaii.</i>

1110
00:56:54,181 --> 00:56:57,484
<i>You get that full, like,</i>
<i>Aloha Hawaiian spirit as</i>
<i>well,</i>

1111
00:56:57,518 --> 00:57:02,489
with, like, the cowboy spirit,
too, you know, kind of mixed
in with these guys.

1112
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:08,663
<i>Getting on a bull</i>
<i>is completely out of</i>
<i>my element, you know.</i>

1113
00:57:08,696 --> 00:57:12,166
<i>It's, it's the scariest thing</i>
<i>ever to me.</i>

1114
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:19,140
<i>It's a little bit different</i>
<i>than big wave surfing,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1115
00:57:19,173 --> 00:57:21,242
<i>When you're out in the water,</i>
<i>then you can</i>

1116
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:23,210
<i>kind of choose</i>
<i>to go on the wave or not.</i>

1117
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:25,179
<i>When you're on the bull,</i>
<i>you know, you're committed.</i>

1118
00:57:28,916 --> 00:57:32,954
<i>Obviously, I know a lot more</i>
<i>about riding a wave than I do</i>
<i>about riding a bull.</i>

1119
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:35,623
<i>So, yeah, I'm pretty quiet</i>
<i>when I,</i>

1120
00:57:35,656 --> 00:57:37,959
when I'm, you know,
getting in the chute.

1121
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,063
<i>On a rainy night</i>
<i>on the North Shore,</i>

1122
00:57:42,096 --> 00:57:46,133
<i>Torrey tests himself</i>
<i>against 1,500-pound</i>
<i>angry bulls.</i>

1123
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,541
Stay. Hold on.

1124
00:57:55,943 --> 00:57:58,612
Stay with him.
Drop your legs.
Drop your legs.

1125
00:57:58,646 --> 00:58:00,348
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1126
00:58:00,381 --> 00:58:02,883
<i>You know, feeling</i>
<i>the power of that bull</i>
<i>when you're getting on it.</i>

1127
00:58:02,917 --> 00:58:05,353
<i>And, like,</i>
<i>you're in the chute, and...</i>

1128
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:08,022
When you nod your head to go,

1129
00:58:08,055 --> 00:58:10,925
and you don't really know
what's gonna happen,

1130
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:13,561
it's kind of the greatest
feeling ever for me.

1131
00:58:13,594 --> 00:58:14,762
And, um,

1132
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:17,898
I became super attracted
to that feeling.

1133
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:39,754
Yeah, don't do that.

1134
00:58:39,787 --> 00:58:41,222
Yeah, drop your legs.

1135
00:59:17,892 --> 00:59:18,893
<i>Throughout</i>
<i>the evening,</i>

1136
00:59:18,926 --> 00:59:21,362
<i>Torrey chooses to nod his head</i>
<i>five times.</i>

1137
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:23,697
<i>He may not have ridden</i>
<i>the fabled eight seconds,</i>

1138
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:27,401
<i>but faced another</i>
<i>side of fear, then,</i>
<i>ended the night unscathed,</i>

1139
00:59:27,435 --> 00:59:31,806
<i>and with as big a smile</i>
<i>on his face as a killer</i>
<i>big wave surf session.</i>

1140
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,912
<i>The winter is winding down,</i>

1141
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:44,218
<i>but forecaster Mark Sponsler</i>
<i>sees something very</i>
<i>interesting  pop up.</i>

1142
00:59:45,554 --> 00:59:48,722
<i>Not for Hawaii, but over</i>
<i>on the North Atlantic</i>

1143
00:59:48,756 --> 00:59:50,724
<i>and aimed at Nazare, Portugal.</i>

1144
00:59:50,758 --> 00:59:53,794
<i>It's good news</i>
<i>for big wave-hungry</i>
<i>Nic Von Rupp,</i>

1145
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:58,232
<i>but also nerve-wracking</i>
<i>as he's still recovering</i>
<i>from an early season injury.</i>

1146
00:59:58,265 --> 01:00:00,968
It's the end of the season.
I bruised my ribs really hard.

1147
01:00:01,001 --> 01:00:02,970
<i>And I was supposed to be</i>
<i>out of the water for a while,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1148
01:00:03,003 --> 01:00:06,140
<i>Like, I was... I thought</i>
<i>that was it. But, then,</i>
<i>this swell popped up.</i>

1149
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:13,047
That swell at Nazare,
a lot of it was the north
angle and the

1150
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:16,050
intensity of the storm,
and the duration of it.

1151
01:00:16,083 --> 01:00:19,554
<i>All that just radiating</i>
<i>and focusing</i>
<i>right on Nazare.</i>

1152
01:00:21,255 --> 01:00:23,558
<i>The swell</i>
<i>is particularly ominous,</i>

1153
01:00:23,592 --> 01:00:27,596
<i>and Sponsler is calling</i>
<i>for something</i>
<i>that could be historic.</i>

1154
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:30,532
<i>Going against</i>
<i>his doctor's advice,</i>

1155
01:00:30,565 --> 01:00:34,201
<i>Nic goes into</i>
<i>full-preparation mode</i>
<i>the day before the swell.</i>

1156
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:40,575
<i>Surfing big waves</i>
<i>is an emotional roller</i>
<i>coaster, you know?</i>

1157
01:00:40,609 --> 01:00:42,143
<i>Like, obviously,</i>
<i>like, when the swell pops up,</i>

1158
01:00:42,176 --> 01:00:45,713
<i>there's excitement, you know?</i>
<i>Like, "Oh, my God,</i>
<i>it's gonna happen."</i>

1159
01:00:45,746 --> 01:00:49,049
Then, the media
start hyping it up, like,
"It's the biggest swell ever!"

1160
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:50,251
And, then,
fear starts kicking in.

1161
01:00:50,284 --> 01:00:52,554
And you're, like,
"Oh, my God,
the biggest swell ever?"

1162
01:00:52,587 --> 01:00:54,455
I mean, I've already seen it,
the biggest ever,

1163
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:57,057
and it was scary, you know?
Like, how can I imagine
it bigger?

1164
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:59,093
Like, everything
starts kicking in, you know?

1165
01:00:59,126 --> 01:01:01,262
And, then, obviously, you,
like, calm down.

1166
01:01:01,295 --> 01:01:05,567
You start focusing,
preparing, start calling up
your team.

1167
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,637
<i>The safety team</i>
<i>meeting takes place</i>
<i>in the harbor.</i>

1168
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:12,039
<i>There is no margin for error.</i>

1169
01:01:12,072 --> 01:01:16,477
On days like this, when it's,
when it's supposed to be
absolutely huge...

1170
01:01:16,511 --> 01:01:18,145
Like, we had a huge swell
on January 8th.

1171
01:01:18,179 --> 01:01:19,847
It was really big
and everything went wrong.

1172
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:23,884
<i>So, this swell, it was</i>
<i>supposed  to be even bigger,</i>
<i>and we doubled up on safety.</i>

1173
01:01:23,918 --> 01:01:27,556
<i>So instead of everyone doing</i>
<i>their own kind of little,</i>
<i>uh...</i>

1174
01:01:27,589 --> 01:01:29,823
<i>tow teams, you know,</i>
<i>of three people,</i>

1175
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:32,993
we create a huge
10-people team, you know?

1176
01:01:34,995 --> 01:01:36,430
<i>It's really a team effort.</i>

1177
01:01:36,463 --> 01:01:41,435
Everyone needs
to be synchronized,
committed, focused.

1178
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:43,737
There's no room for mistakes,
you know?

1179
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:45,973
It's just, like, mistakes,

1180
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,475
is ending up on the rocks.

1181
01:01:52,146 --> 01:01:54,715
<i>The dangers</i>
<i>of Nazare are real.</i>

1182
01:01:54,748 --> 01:01:56,150
<i>From being smashed</i>
<i>in the rocks</i>

1183
01:01:56,183 --> 01:01:58,385
<i>to crushed in the pounding</i>
<i>shore break,</i>

1184
01:01:58,419 --> 01:02:02,591
<i>it's easy for things</i>
<i>to go very wrong</i>
<i>with real consequences.</i>

1185
01:02:02,624 --> 01:02:05,926
<i>The special thing</i>
<i>about Nazare is its canyon,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1186
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,530
<i>It's, it's unique.</i>
<i>It's like a world wonder.</i>

1187
01:02:08,563 --> 01:02:12,601
It's one of the deepest
canyons in the world, and the
way you can compare it,

1188
01:02:12,634 --> 01:02:14,536
<i>is to the Grand Canyon.</i>

1189
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:18,005
<i>Basically, it just catches</i>
<i>the swell in the middle</i>
<i>of the ocean.</i>

1190
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:20,074
<i>So the swell's coming in</i>
<i>from the Atlantic.</i>

1191
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:23,744
And what it does,
all that energy
just compresses

1192
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:29,083
to the depth of that canyon,
and just shoots up
with all its strength

1193
01:02:29,116 --> 01:02:30,951
straight at the
beach, you know?

1194
01:02:30,985 --> 01:02:33,254
And, and, then, when it hits
that shallow part,

1195
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:36,625
the wave just, like,
stands up, you know?

1196
01:02:36,658 --> 01:02:39,260
And that's how you get
that mountain of water,
you know?

1197
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:08,155
We've been talking
since 6, 6:30 a.m.
with the team

1198
01:03:08,422 --> 01:03:09,857
and...

1199
01:03:09,890 --> 01:03:11,626
Lucas said it's huge.

1200
01:03:12,893 --> 01:03:14,763
Windy.

1201
01:03:14,795 --> 01:03:16,698
And clean.

1202
01:03:16,731 --> 01:03:18,999
Let's wait.

1203
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:22,236
I don't know, we might see
that first 100 ft wave,
we might not.

1204
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:27,808
<i>There was definitely</i>
<i>a hiccup in the morning.</i>

1205
01:03:27,841 --> 01:03:31,845
<i>I mean, I figured out</i>
<i>my vest had a hole.</i>

1206
01:03:31,879 --> 01:03:34,649
<i>And you don't want your vest</i>
<i>that saves your life,</i>

1207
01:03:34,683 --> 01:03:36,350
<i>to have a hole, to be leaking,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1208
01:03:36,383 --> 01:03:38,152
<i>You don't wanna be</i>
<i>thinking about that,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1209
01:03:38,185 --> 01:03:40,421
<i>Like, you wanna to be</i>
<i>100% focused</i>

1210
01:03:40,454 --> 01:03:42,289
<i>and be trusting</i>
<i>your equipment.</i>

1211
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:49,698
My vest had a hole,
someone took my fins...

1212
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,367
<i>and, all of a sudden,</i>
<i>I'm just, like, "Yo, no."</i>

1213
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,235
<i>I wasn't under control</i>
<i>of the whole situation,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1214
01:03:55,269 --> 01:04:00,608
<i>And when you're putting</i>
<i>your life at risk like that,</i>
<i>you want to be 100% in</i>
<i>control.</i>

1215
01:04:02,076 --> 01:04:04,311
<i>A variety of big</i>
<i>wave surfers have arrived</i>

1216
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:06,748
<i>from across the globe</i>
<i>to challenge the waves,</i>

1217
01:04:06,781 --> 01:04:10,050
<i>including Brazilian charger</i>
<i>Michaela Fregonese,</i>

1218
01:04:10,084 --> 01:04:12,620
<i>whose young son</i>
<i>waits nervously back home.</i>

1219
01:04:13,187 --> 01:04:14,488
He's scared, you know?

1220
01:04:14,522 --> 01:04:17,559
He scared to lose me,
that's why.

1221
01:04:17,592 --> 01:04:22,329
<i>Because do you know</i>
<i>how danger is, so...</i>

1222
01:04:22,363 --> 01:04:23,665
Wait a second.
This is dangerous?

1223
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:27,167
Oh, yeah!
Super dangerous. Yeah.

1224
01:04:28,202 --> 01:04:30,404
<i>I don't rush because I know...</i>

1225
01:04:30,437 --> 01:04:34,509
<i>anyway, that God</i>
<i>is gonna be, like...</i>

1226
01:04:34,542 --> 01:04:39,113
<i>my best wave.</i>
<i>Like, the biggest wave</i>
<i>of my life, for sure, today.</i>

1227
01:04:39,146 --> 01:04:42,784
I was praying not only for me,
but for all.

1228
01:04:42,817 --> 01:04:44,318
For all the people here.

1229
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:47,254
Because, if nobody hurts,

1230
01:04:47,287 --> 01:04:49,022
you feeling more confident,
you know?

1231
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:52,694
- If you were hurt...
- It's scary, you know?

1232
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:56,397
<i>If nobody hurt,</i>
<i>everybody happy,</i>
<i>everybody get the bomb,</i>

1233
01:04:56,430 --> 01:04:57,931
<i>everything's gonna be okay.</i>

1234
01:04:57,965 --> 01:05:00,668
<i>So I pray for everyone</i>
<i>here today.</i>

1235
01:05:00,702 --> 01:05:03,370
<i>One of the surfers</i>
<i>here is Vini Dos Santos,</i>

1236
01:05:03,404 --> 01:05:04,938
<i>32, from Brazil.</i>

1237
01:05:04,972 --> 01:05:08,843
<i>He's famed for catching</i>
<i>one of the biggest</i>
<i>paddle-in waves at Nazare.</i>

1238
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:12,079
<i>But now he's determined</i>
<i>to make his mark</i>
<i>by picking up the rope</i>

1239
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:16,283
<i>and hunting down a monster,</i>
<i>and making his mark</i>
<i>on the global stage.</i>

1240
01:05:28,495 --> 01:05:31,833
<i>You know, I had</i>
<i>some issues in the morning.</i>
<i>The vest, the fins.</i>

1241
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:34,368
<i>But, you know, like,</i>
<i>we're cowboys</i>
<i>at the end of the day</i>

1242
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:35,936
<i>and we just make it happen,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1243
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:39,373
<i>Like, so my buddy</i>
<i>lended me a vest,</i>
<i>my buddy lended me some fins.</i>

1244
01:05:41,108 --> 01:05:42,777
-That one is gonna be
a buoy?
-That one's gonna be, uh...

1245
01:05:42,811 --> 01:05:45,012
-Okay, who's gonna go
on that one?
-The... the other guy...

1246
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:48,415
For me, what really matters
is the team spirit
and, obviously, commitment.

1247
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:49,818
<i>You wanna be out</i>
<i>there all day.</i>

1248
01:05:49,851 --> 01:05:51,485
<i>You want to catch...</i>
<i>You want to surf big waves.</i>

1249
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,822
<i>You want to make</i>
<i>the most of this.</i>

1250
01:05:53,855 --> 01:05:55,389
Go prepare.

1251
01:05:59,993 --> 01:06:04,431
<i>When I get on my jet ski,</i>
<i>it's... That's when I, like,</i>
<i>feel connected.</i>

1252
01:06:04,465 --> 01:06:06,768
<i>It's like an extension</i>
<i>of my body, you know?</i>

1253
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:10,103
<i>I can... I just feel</i>
<i>that adrenaline.</i>

1254
01:06:10,137 --> 01:06:13,207
<i>It's like going to war,</i>
<i>you know? It's preparing,</i>
<i>like, going to war.</i>

1255
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:37,364
<i>When the surf</i>
<i>comes into their sights,</i>

1256
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:40,200
<i>Sponsler's forecast</i>
<i>is proven accurate.</i>

1257
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,268
<i>It's big.</i>

1258
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:44,539
<i>The only question is,</i>
<i>is it historically big?</i>

1259
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:51,178
<i>Big wave surfing</i>
<i>really relates to the daily</i>
<i>activity of anyone.</i>

1260
01:06:51,211 --> 01:06:52,012
<i>Everyone has dreams.</i>

1261
01:06:52,045 --> 01:06:53,648
<i>Everyone is afraid</i>
<i>of the dreams.</i>

1262
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:57,117
<i>And a lot of people</i>
<i>are not able to achieve</i>
<i>their dreams because of fear,</i>

1263
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:58,185
<i>gets in the middle of it.</i>

1264
01:06:58,218 --> 01:06:59,854
<i>It's exactly the same way,</i>
<i>big wave surfing.</i>

1265
01:06:59,888 --> 01:07:03,190
<i>I have the dream.</i>
<i>I have the dream of surfing</i>
<i>the biggest wave of my life.</i>

1266
01:07:03,223 --> 01:07:05,793
<i>I'm afraid of it,</i>
<i>of what can happen.</i>

1267
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:13,433
My boyfriend,
Nick Von Rupp, he's a surfer,
a big wave surfer.

1268
01:07:13,467 --> 01:07:17,539
<i>I just have to keep believing</i>
<i>that everything</i>
<i>will be fine, because...</i>

1269
01:07:19,239 --> 01:07:22,911
...this is a matter
of life and death.

1270
01:07:26,915 --> 01:07:29,449
<i>The first wave,</i>
<i>it was so choppy.</i>

1271
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:32,219
<i>I was going so fast</i>
<i>and through those bumps,</i>

1272
01:07:32,252 --> 01:07:34,989
<i>and I felt like my board</i>
<i>was skidding out.</i>

1273
01:07:35,023 --> 01:07:37,357
<i>You know, having that feeling</i>
<i>of not being in control</i>

1274
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:40,762
<i>and, all of a sudden,</i>
<i>you feel your fin</i>
<i>sliding sideways,</i>

1275
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:43,463
<i>and you're holding on.</i>
<i>Like, it gives you</i>
<i>that snowboard feeling.</i>

1276
01:07:43,497 --> 01:07:48,135
<i>You know where you're, like,</i>
<i>trying to, like, use your</i>
<i>edges  instead of your fins.</i>

1277
01:07:48,168 --> 01:07:51,806
<i>That's what it felt like.</i>
<i>I'm like, "Oh, my God!</i>
<i>I'm gonna eat shit right now."</i>

1278
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:09,524
<i>I went flying down, like,</i>
<i>both arms, trying to penetrate</i>
<i>through the water,</i>

1279
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:13,895
<i>thinking I'm gonna</i>
<i>pull through, you know,</i>
<i>and swim on the other side.</i>

1280
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:15,964
At one moment, I
think I got it.

1281
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:19,266
And, then, the thing
just takes me down and
explodes.

1282
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:28,676
<i>Lucas comes up to pick me up.</i>

1283
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:30,979
<i>The wipeout</i>
<i>was bad enough...</i>

1284
01:08:31,012 --> 01:08:33,146
<i>then, things get worse.</i>

1285
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:35,750
<i>A second wave appears.</i>

1286
01:08:35,783 --> 01:08:38,920
<i>It takes duck-diving</i>
<i>a 900-pound Jet Ski</i>

1287
01:08:38,953 --> 01:08:42,790
<i>with Nic holding on</i>
<i>with one good arm</i>
<i>to escape the maelstrom.</i>

1288
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:48,295
Oh, my God, that's not
how I wanna start the day,
you know?

1289
01:08:51,666 --> 01:08:52,867
<i>I felt something was wrong,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1290
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:55,670
<i>But, with the adrenaline,</i>
<i>you don't feel it, you know?</i>

1291
01:08:55,703 --> 01:08:57,739
You know, it was...
You know, I had to take
a little break

1292
01:08:57,772 --> 01:08:59,540
and, then, all of a sudden,
my arm started hurting.

1293
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:01,976
<i>Like, I couldn't even hold on</i>
<i>to the Jet Ski.</i>

1294
01:09:03,511 --> 01:09:05,079
<i>But I was, like,</i>
<i>"This is my day.</i>

1295
01:09:05,113 --> 01:09:08,482
"This is, like...
I can't give up right now,"
you know?

1296
01:09:15,923 --> 01:09:17,424
<i>Undaunted</i>
<i>by Nic's injury</i>

1297
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:19,292
<i>and the vibe change</i>
<i>in the water,</i>

1298
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:23,064
<i> Michaela finds the</i>
<i>opportunity  to get the ride</i>
<i>of her life.</i>

1299
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:38,178
<i>With a solid one</i>
<i>under her belt,</i>

1300
01:09:38,211 --> 01:09:39,881
<i>Michaela heads back out</i>

1301
01:09:39,914 --> 01:09:44,886
<i>and catches what is, arguably,</i>
<i>one of the biggest waves</i>
<i>ever ridden by a woman.</i>

1302
01:09:48,623 --> 01:09:50,323
<i>That's the best</i>
<i>feeling ever.</i>

1303
01:09:50,357 --> 01:09:52,527
<i>When you do what you love,</i>

1304
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:55,029
<i>no one get hurt, nothing,</i>

1305
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:55,997
<i>it's so amazing.</i>

1306
01:10:05,272 --> 01:10:09,777
<i>As with any</i>
<i>big wave session,</i>
<i>there was sure to be carnage.</i>

1307
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:34,434
<i>Also cashing in his chips</i>
<i>at the pain window</i>
<i>is Vini Dos Santos, where</i>

1308
01:10:34,468 --> 01:10:36,671
<i>things go wrong</i>
<i>on a big one,</i>

1309
01:10:36,704 --> 01:10:38,973
<i>things go wrong in a big way.</i>

1310
01:10:52,787 --> 01:10:55,322
<i>The ski tries to reach him</i>
<i>to get him to safety,</i>

1311
01:10:55,355 --> 01:10:56,858
<i>but another wave rolls in,</i>

1312
01:10:56,891 --> 01:11:00,027
<i>and he's left helpless</i>
<i>and beaten up</i>
<i>in the impact zone.</i>

1313
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:04,397
<i>In unprecedented fashion,</i>

1314
01:11:04,431 --> 01:11:07,101
<i>the pressure of the wave</i>
<i>has popped his inflation vest</i>

1315
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:08,903
<i>and the metal canister</i>
<i>gets ripped out</i>

1316
01:11:08,936 --> 01:11:10,571
<i>and starts hitting him</i>
<i>on the head.</i>

1317
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:17,111
<i>Barely conscious,</i>
<i>the ski driver races him</i>
<i>to the beach.</i>

1318
01:11:27,387 --> 01:11:31,659
<i>After the intense hold-down,</i>
<i>Vini is administered oxygen</i>
<i>on the beach.</i>

1319
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:33,694
<i>It is thanks</i>
<i>to the well-prepped</i>
<i>safety team</i>

1320
01:11:33,728 --> 01:11:36,597
<i>that Vini is okay</i>
<i>after a relentless wipeout.</i>

1321
01:11:43,571 --> 01:11:47,642
<i>While on the stretcher,</i>
<i>he talks about a giant wave</i>
<i>he caught earlier.</i>

1322
01:11:52,013 --> 01:11:56,184
<i>Later, looking at the</i>
<i>footage,  it reveals</i>
<i>something extraordinary.</i>

1323
01:11:56,217 --> 01:11:59,452
<i>It appears he might have</i>
<i>ridden  a record-setting wave,</i>

1324
01:11:59,486 --> 01:12:02,190
<i>perhaps the 100-foot wave.</i>

1325
01:12:15,036 --> 01:12:18,239
<i>The measuring of waves</i>
<i>is as much art as science.</i>

1326
01:12:18,272 --> 01:12:22,710
<i>One oceanographer later</i>
<i>pegged this wave at 97.5 feet.</i>

1327
01:12:29,851 --> 01:12:32,687
<i>Variables as to where the top</i>
<i>and bottom of the wave are,</i>

1328
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:36,123
<i>the fact that the wave</i>
<i>flattened out as he surfed</i>
<i>to his right,</i>

1329
01:12:36,157 --> 01:12:39,026
<i>and the incalculable</i>
<i>distortion from the lens,</i>

1330
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:41,696
<i>leave the measurement</i>
<i>in the eye of the beholder.</i>

1331
01:12:46,934 --> 01:12:49,103
<i>History might have been made</i>
<i>by Vini</i>

1332
01:12:49,136 --> 01:12:52,640
<i>but, out in the lineup,</i>
<i>Nic rallies to catch one more,</i>

1333
01:12:52,673 --> 01:12:57,211
<i>despite bruised ribs,</i>
<i>and literally having</i>
<i>only one arm with any</i>
<i>strength.</i>

1334
01:12:58,846 --> 01:13:00,948
<i>It's stupid.</i>
<i>Like, my body</i>
<i>is telling me to stop.</i>

1335
01:13:00,982 --> 01:13:03,885
<i>My... my ribs</i>
<i>are almost broken.</i>

1336
01:13:03,918 --> 01:13:06,153
<i>My arm is, like, I don't know</i>
<i>what I have in my arm,</i>

1337
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:07,555
<i>but it's, like,</i>
<i>I can't move it.</i>

1338
01:13:07,588 --> 01:13:08,656
My body is telling me to stop.

1339
01:13:08,689 --> 01:13:10,691
Like, you know,
life gives you signs.

1340
01:13:10,725 --> 01:13:13,094
Your body gives you signs
when it's enough and...

1341
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:16,797
But I just thought, like,
whatever, you know?
Like, let's just go again.

1342
01:13:21,602 --> 01:13:25,438
<i>And I'm getting, like,</i>
<i>a first peaker,</i>
<i>like, really intense,</i>

1343
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:27,008
<i>where I, like, dropped down.</i>

1344
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:30,745
<i>I ran in front of the cliff,</i>
<i>and the thing just stood up</i>
<i>really tall.</i>

1345
01:13:33,614 --> 01:13:37,084
<i>Just magic, you know?</i>
<i>Like, the wave was so clean,</i>
<i>so big.</i>

1346
01:13:37,118 --> 01:13:38,319
<i>I faded deep.</i>

1347
01:13:40,655 --> 01:13:43,724
<i>I had that feeling</i>
<i>that I wanted, you know?</i>
<i>Like, in 100% control.</i>

1348
01:13:43,758 --> 01:13:48,729
<i>You know, like, riding as deep</i>
<i>as I can, pushing my limits,</i>
<i>but in control, you know?</i>

1349
01:13:48,763 --> 01:13:50,831
<i>I was writing the waves</i>
<i>the way I wanted.</i>

1350
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:07,782
We made it!

1351
01:14:07,815 --> 01:14:13,254
Guys, thank you so much
for your approach,
for your confidence in my job.

1352
01:14:14,789 --> 01:14:16,123
<i>For me, like,</i>
<i>it was a successful day</i>

1353
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:18,059
<i>not because I rode</i>
<i>the biggest waves of my life.</i>

1354
01:14:18,092 --> 01:14:23,698
For me, it was a successful
day because we are back
in one piece.

1355
01:14:23,731 --> 01:14:25,599
My ribs are hurting.
My shoulders are hurting.

1356
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:28,936
Like, I can't even lift my arm
more than this, it feels like.

1357
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,771
And I still caught,
like, three waves.

1358
01:14:30,805 --> 01:14:32,974
My best waves.
Like, I couldn't move my arm.

1359
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:34,875
So, for me, it was, like, a...

1360
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:37,411
a real effort of,
kind of like, pushing my
limits

1361
01:14:37,445 --> 01:14:40,881
and pushing my boundaries
and the commitment, you know?

1362
01:14:40,915 --> 01:14:42,750
<i>Like, that's the most</i>
<i>important  for me.</i>

1363
01:14:44,685 --> 01:14:47,655
Oh, I got five waves. Five.

1364
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:50,291
<i>Four right, and one left.</i>

1365
01:14:50,324 --> 01:14:55,429
Yeah, today was the biggest
wave I ever surf in my life,
for sure.

1366
01:14:57,665 --> 01:14:59,900
<i>You always feel like</i>
<i>you could have done better,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1367
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:01,836
<i>I'm never satisfied.</i>

1368
01:15:01,869 --> 01:15:04,438
Like, I'm very driven.
I always wanna do better.

1369
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:05,673
I always wanna progress.

1370
01:15:05,706 --> 01:15:07,241
<i>Not for others,</i>
<i>but for myself.</i>

1371
01:15:07,274 --> 01:15:08,876
<i>Like that's what I'm made of,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1372
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:12,847
<i>Like, that's what kept me</i>
<i>in the game.</i> That's what
kept me progressing.

1373
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,882
<i>We're still scratching</i>
<i>the surface on what...</i>

1374
01:15:14,915 --> 01:15:17,385
<i>what's doable</i>
<i>and what's big out in Nazare.</i>

1375
01:15:17,418 --> 01:15:20,121
<i>So, I mean, let's see</i>
<i>what's gonna happen</i>
<i>the next five years.</i>

1376
01:15:20,154 --> 01:15:22,056
<i>Let's see what's gonna happen</i>
<i>the next 10 years.</i>

1377
01:15:22,089 --> 01:15:24,825
<i>Eventually it's gonna be,</i>
<i>you know, over 100-foot.</i>

1378
01:15:26,927 --> 01:15:28,162
<i>Let's see what's gonna happen,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

1379
01:15:28,195 --> 01:15:30,498
<i>And I hope</i>
<i>I'll still be here to...</i>

1380
01:15:30,531 --> 01:15:32,199
<i>to see it, you know?</i>

1381
01:15:44,345 --> 01:15:48,282
<i>At the end</i>
<i>of the day, they paddled out.</i>

1382
01:15:48,315 --> 01:15:52,920
<i>Some dreams are realized</i>
<i>and some are not.</i>

1383
01:15:52,953 --> 01:15:57,725
<i>For those watching,</i>
<i>for those riding,</i>
<i>the lesson remains the same...</i>

1384
01:15:57,758 --> 01:16:03,397
<i>pushing limits and facing</i>
<i>fears  leads to progression,</i>
<i>leads to growth...</i>

1385
01:16:03,931 --> 01:16:06,267
<i>leads to what is next.</i>

1386
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,969
<i>The Northern Hemisphere</i>
<i>will go dormant.</i>

1387
01:16:09,003 --> 01:16:11,005
<i>These men and women will wait.</i>

1388
01:16:11,038 --> 01:16:13,607
<i>The waves will return.</i>

1389
01:16:13,641 --> 01:16:15,876
<i>They will test</i>
<i>themselves again.</i>

1390
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:19,814
<i>And we all will be inspired</i>
<i>by their example</i>
<i>to face our fears</i>

1391
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:25,019
<i>and push into and past</i>
<i>the fear of the unknown</i>
<i>in our own lives...</i>

1392
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:30,357
<i>to the other side of fear.</i>
