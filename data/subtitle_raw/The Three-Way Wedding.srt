1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,795
THE THREEWAY WEDDING

2
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,159
This relationship

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,436
stinks.

4
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,829
You call me then you get moralistic.
You've got nerve.

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,158
I don't call you.
I call no one.

6
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,756
I forbid you to mention your visits.

7
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,149
You must free this house
of your presence.

8
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,711
- I must?
- Yes.

9
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,199
When you push me away, you drive out
what's most precious in you.

10
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,395
You know that.

11
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,959
Even after everything,
I need to see you.

12
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,397
I'm pleased when you come back.

13
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,235
They're here.

14
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,156
I'm coming down.

15
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,909
Hello, Fanny.

16
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,317
You got the mail?
All incredibly important, I guess.

17
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,710
No, nothing looks important.

18
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,639
I'm expecting guests.

19
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,311
I'll be up
if they piss me off.

20
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,551
Call me if anything needs doing.

21
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,075
I'll come up later to sign stuff.

22
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,752
You can venture out.

23
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,553
I've combed the area.

24
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,950
Not so much as a sniff of a snail.

25
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,234
There are things to clear up
in this nasty play?

26
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,352
This is Théo,
our distinguished actor.

27
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,069
Auguste...

28
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,076
How are you?

29
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,229
- Don't you do textual analysis?
- They want it from the oracle.

30
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,834
I'm chopped liver. Fried.

31
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,997
It's not the first time
you want to discuss a role.

32
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,712
But it's the first time,
I'll buy into this charade.

33
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,479
- You came up twice this morning.
- Stop it!

34
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,032
Are you losing it
or trying to make me feel guilty?

35
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,237
I never come here.
Morning, night, never.

36
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,152
Exactly what I hold against you.

37
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,475
He leads her off
to try to win her back again.

38
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,796
- Am I wrong?
- It's always like that.

39
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,235
Yes, but it's an obscene ritual.

40
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,233
Coming here with you two
kept me awake all night.

41
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,917
That's not why I'm here.

42
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,079
What you write,
that's what makes us alive.

43
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,478
We are still one.

44
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,710
Distance doesn't exist for us.

45
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,913
One?
Like husband and wife, you mean?

46
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,311
Why do you always laugh about us?

47
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,312
You should do like Man Ray.

48
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,554
One night, Man Ray...

49
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,398
had an attack of insomnia.

50
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,635
Devastating. Unbearable.
As he'd never been insomniac,

51
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,152
he bought himself a revolver,

52
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,908
intending to shoot himself
if it recurred.

53
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,558
he put the revolver
on his nightstand.

54
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,470
And he slept like a log.

55
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,549
His unconscious
decided to pipe down

56
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,268
and stop busting his balls at night.

57
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,192
He never got insomnia again.

58
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,919
Miserable isn't the word,
it's painful.

59
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,356
You and me,
we transcend painful.

60
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,993
Who says
I still want your painful happiness?

61
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,389
Sorry, I have to leave after lunch.

62
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,073

'

 introduce you to Fanny.

63
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,709
Who's Fanny?

64
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,314
A student
at Angouléme University.

65
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,957
She's very charming
and adept at replying to mail.

66
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,030
That's new.

67
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,713
Two months already.

68
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,837
You don't call too often,

69
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,311
so you miss out on
details of my thrilling life.

70
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,316
She comes one morning a week.

71
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,271
You've reworked the final scene?

72
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,953
No, it resists.

73
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,034
I thought meeting Théo might help.

74
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,315
It will help.

75
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,912
We're going upstairs.
Won't be long.

76
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,150
Harriet, this is Fanny.

77
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,918
The letters you don't send me...

78
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,633
She opens them.

79
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,953
We'll leave you to it.

80
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,153
Pretty, huh?

81
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,470
Much more.
You should marry her.

82
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,915
There's an idea.
It has occurred to me.

83
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,239
Why theatre?

84
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,277
Because people like you
write what I wish I'd written.

85
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,592
As I can't, I enjoy acting it.

86
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,711
Anyone can be a dramatist.

87
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,433
At night perhaps.

88
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,348
In my dreams,

89
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,953
I stage little plays
of which I'm author and actor.

90
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,156
That don't lack imagination.

91
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,596
Not necessarily.

92
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,359
I dream I can't act.

93
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,314
I'm in a theatre.

94
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,276
We're in rehearsal
but there's always something

95
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,511
or someone
that stops me acting.

96
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,633
Why do you write plays?

97
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,275
It has to talk.
Film is full of silences,

98
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,750
and it's the only time in life
you escape. It's fun.

99
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,309
You probe,
you punish, you reward,

100
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,311
you blow people away,
you absolve,

101
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,677
you're always spying.
It's fun and you never let go.

102
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,712
You're a full-on bodyguard.

103
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,714
No, I have a sticky beak.
Do you know the expression?

104
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,475
It means to meddle.

105
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,799
Very picturesque.

106
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,515
And your character,
when he thinks he's been let go

107
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,958
and can do stuff on the sly,
he cops it.

108
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,075
And pow!

109
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,112
He gets slapped down.

110
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,557
We hound him, take all he has.
Feelings, passions, thoughts,

111
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,312
his lines, everything.

112
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,110
And we make him say stuff,
he maybe wouldn't dare say.

113
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,239
Isn't that fun?

114
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,118
Didn't you want to act?

115
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,238
I wasn't a good actor.

116
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,838
All I wanted to do
was spew stuff at the audience

117
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,560
that I didn't write
and wasn't accountable for.

118
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,877
And you?

119
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,356
How did Stéphane unearth you?

120
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,149
Where did you unearth me?

121
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,756
Who cares where we unearthed you.
The posters are ready.

122
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,751
And you know your lines,
unlike Harriet, the favorite.

123
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,155
Whose favorite am I?

124
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,231
On top of that, he's gifted.

125
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,910
It won't be his fault if it bombs.

126
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,557
I'm gonna make the play a flop.

127
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,956
I'll stand there like you,
front stage,

128
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,473
and I'll nix the character.

129
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,428
Are you saying I settle scores
with women through her?

130
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,238
V\ﬁth one woman in particular?

131
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,994
She isn't positive enough,
or some such shit?

132
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,548
The question is,
Is it lacking in life?

133
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,429
My life is, sure.
Yours, definitely.

134
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,431
My play can't lack life.

135
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,795
As much.

136
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,428
Why talk about my life,
lacking life or not?

137
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,749
Talk about yours.

138
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,389
You're right.

139
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,829
I still want to know
where I was unearthed.

140
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,718
Predators like you

141
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,757
go to ground
in inaccessible places.

142
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,993
I don't want to hear this.

143
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,751
Put the pasta on.

144
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,674
I have to see the girl upstairs.
I'll be right back.

145
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,677
You don't deserve me sewing you.

146
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,191
Just invitations
and a letter from a German publisher.

147
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,159
And a check's arrived.
You need to endorse it.

148
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,276
That boy's way too flip.

149
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,909
And Harriet acts like he doesn't exist.

150
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,995
Not a glance.
Not a single expression...

151
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,954
of solidarity.

152
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,034
They're taking me for a ride.

153
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,674
And her life.
Her life that's...

154
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,912
so full of life.

155
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,399
That's new.

156
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,795
Know why they came?

157
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,433
To be sure
I'll finish the final draft.

158
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,958
Seeing them prowl around me,
I have no desire to.

159
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,074
And that thing...

160
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,829
What if I didn't do the rewrite?

161
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,875
What if I left it unfinished
so they couldn't perform it?

162
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,790
When she arrived,
I found her ugly.

163
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,116
She's pretty.

164
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,998
She can be pretty.

165
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,629
I find her ugly.

166
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,473
Hypocrisy taints the inside
and it shows.

167
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,032
She's too old for the part.

168
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,553
She doesn't have its innocence either.

169
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,951
She belongs to another man.

170
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,119
I'm sure of it.

171
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,752
It doesn't stop her visiting me
nearly every night.

172
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,757
By day, her interest
is strictly professional.

173
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,872
She's using the play discreetly
to sell me her lover.

174
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,430
Why does she think I'm so stupid?

175
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,352
The role doesn't suit her.

176
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,914
Everything will be overacted.

177
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,559
Innocence, naivety...

178
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,069
All she's lost with age,
she'll emphasize because it's gone.

179
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,233
She no longer feels it.

180
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,994
Can you read through a scene
I'd like to hear?

181
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,711
I bashed it out yesterday.

182
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:32,830
I can't act it,
I can only read it.

183
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,560
Good, I want to hear it
barely performed.

184
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,112
I look younger and feel beﬂer.

185
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,679
Yes, I'm cutting back.

186
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,912
I'll only keep
the hours laughing with a child,

187
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,270
listening to music I love...

188
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,159
I said "read"
to stop you being dramatic.

189
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,753
Add a little music.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,831
I look younger and feel beﬂer.

191
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,113
Yes, I'm cutting back.

192
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,598
I'll only keep
the hours laughing with a child,

193
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,996
listening to music I love,

194
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,749
being caressed in beds,
playing ping-pong,

195
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,548
wandering aimlessly
through the streets

196
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,237
and trashing everything trivial.

197
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,550
Fanny...

198
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,751
Did you ever think about acting?

199
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,070
Would you like to work on
one or two scenes with me?

200
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,789
Yes.

201
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,118
You think no
and say yes.

202
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,954
You're funny.

203
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,238
I'll leave you to the mail.

204
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,754
Call me if you sense
that downstairs...

205
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,955
Thank you.

206
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,193
I'm much calmer now.

207
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,833
Before the charade,

208
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,470
remember to take a piss.

209
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,356
So, how does he like his pasta?

210
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,079
I like it very hard.

211
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,113
And your sperm sweet.
How do you get it so sweet?

212
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,396
Time I jumped you, right?

213
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,073
Your cock, anytime, anywhere.

214
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,589
You told me to behave,
I'm behaving.

215
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,155
Answer me.

216
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,030
How come yours is so sweet?
It's unique.

217
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,671
Kiss me or I'll rape you.

218
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,349
Is it the mood ofthis house
driving you sex mad?

219
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:55,358
"The pretty child that puts in your hand
a well formed breast...

220
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,355
I'm going-

221
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,635
I withdraw.

222
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,677
What music to go with that?

223
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,709
Pasta.

224
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,589
You bring that recipe for rabbit pété?

225
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,710
My mother's rabbit pété.

226
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,236
I have rabbits in the garden,
and no pété.

227
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,030
But a recipe
to stop them running riot.

228
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,189
Your shotgun!

229
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,635
No, that's for blowing my brains out.

230
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,278
Ask your friendly barber
for hair clippings.

231
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,592
Scatter them around young plants
and the rabbits run a mile.

232
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,110
You remember the braid you gave me?

233
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,073
You hung it on a carrot?

234
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,515
No, I unplaited it

235
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,274
and arranged it around the camellia
you gave me.

236
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,396
I couldn't use a stranger's hair.

237
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,237
Not even the woman
who gave you the climbing rose?

238
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,037
Come on, I want a word.

239
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,759
Let them stuff their faces.

240
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,228
What's he up to?

241
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,310
He wants to know.

242
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,832
It's not my best play.

243
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,515
I wrote it
without visualizing much.

244
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,789
I can't even see Harriet
playing Aurélie.

245
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,473
You're wrong to doubt her.

246
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,234
When she reads,
you want to see her on stage.

247
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,238
I always have doubts.

248
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,676
Her age bothers me, too.

249
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,276
I'm not sure she can play a woman
barely out of adolescence.

250
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,912
If you'd prefer me
not to be in your play, say so.

251
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,877
You can refuse Stéphane's choice.

252
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,951
You're funny, you actors.

253
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,554
You're far more paranoid
than anyone else.

254
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,990
True, you're so exposed and vulnerable.

255
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,230
You're way off.
I'm being open with you.

256
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,719
Open with me?

257
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,793
If you doubt Harriet, why not doubt me?
You don't know me.

258
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,430
It's your decision.
Stéphane can't impose me on you.

259
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,318
He's imposing you?

260
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,358
I suppose.

261
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,799
I thought it was Harriet.

262
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,748
She didn't mention you,
which is a way of "imposing" you.

263
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,876
Careful
she doesn't use you against me.

264
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,873
Against you?

265
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,758
It's over between us.

266
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,029
She might enjoy
throwing you against me.

267
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,350
I'm lost.

268
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,592
Yes, she might enjoy
throwing you against me to...

269
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,598
We'll use quotes, it's hip.

270
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,194
And the word's fallen out of favor.

271
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,157
- What word?
- "Offend".

272
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,754
She might enjoy throwing you at me
to offend me.

273
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,992
It may be over,
but there's no room between us. None.

274
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,833
Coming between us
is dangerous, you see?

275
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,554
I have no intention of offending you,

276
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,917
and whatever I do with the role,
you'll be disappointed.

277
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,957
You assume
I'll come to see it.

278
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,317
I thought you took me aside
for a kind of audition.

279
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,152
What's going on?

280
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,790
I took Harriet without permission.
I don't need your permission.

281
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,075
I won't do the play,
I'll go back to Paris.

282
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,708
Tell Harriet not to worry,
I'll be fine.

283
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,553
- I just wanted to warn you.
- Against what?

284
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,917
I'm marrying Harriet on September 26.
Warn me against what?

285
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,356
I hope the date's okay for you.

286
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:02,909
And stop threatening me.

287
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,632
He's not very strong.

288
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,031
He ran away like a rabbit.

289
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,472
Because he knows
coming between us will kill him.

290
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,517
- What did you tell him?
- The truth.

291
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,633
They can't take it.
It's an ordeal for them.

292
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,875
But I didn't have time to tell him

293
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,512
he touches me when he caresses you.
Yes, he's copping a feel of me!

294
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,477
You think I want to fight suicide?
That's your plan?

295
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,709
You're crazy!

296
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,710
You know why he seduced you?

297
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,793
I know.
So he could brag about it, right?

298
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,030
Exactly. You understand.

299
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,832
Nobody told me you were lovers,
but I knew it.

300
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,228
Intuitively.

301
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,118
You can't hide anything from me.

302
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,518
You belong to another man.
Not him. He knows it.

303
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,989
But we divorced, you and me.

304
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,353
Why on earth
did I bring him to see you?

305
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,876
Don't worry, if he can't stay,
he won't run very far.

306
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,314
You'll soon find him.

307
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,670
But when you leave him...

308
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,955
Be quiet!

309
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,680
When you leave him, he'll suffer.

310
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,995
A sore loser can't be a good actor.

311
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,995
What I've written is my revenge
on the people who hurt me.

312
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,670
Don't expect me to let one of them
act in my play!

313
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,799
Why didn't you tell me?

314
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,878
I brought him so you'd guess.

315
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,793
I knew it wouldn't take long.

316
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,037
How 
ong's this been going on
behind my bac
C?

317
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,588
I chose him.
They'd never met before.

318
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,678
You're the matchmaker.

319
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,553
He's a good actor.

320
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,910
I couldn't work out
why finishing the play was so hard.

321
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,833
Since he came on the scene,
I've been stuck.

322
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,520
Now I know why I couldn't write.

323
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,709
They've known each other
nearly two months?

324
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,678
What are you going to do?

325
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,440
You've lost your actor.
And actress.

326
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,079
You haven't got a play.

327
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,279
I'll never finish it.

328
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,595
Not for them.

329
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,234
Studying law isn't a vocation,
it's Daddy's choice.

330
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,151
You want to please him,
but you have other dreams.

331
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,276
No?

332
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,359
I like law.

333
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,636
I need to write for someone.

334
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,511
And I can't write for her now.

335
00:26:56,920 --> 00:27:00,515
The girl who captivates,
if she wants to and is talented,

336
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,079
that works.

337
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,514
Take a seat over here.

338
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,118
We'll do tests to reassure you

339
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,477
and gradually
you'll build up your confidence.

340
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,993
I'm not an actress.

341
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,230
In that case, I finish the play.

342
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,598
She performs it in Paris.

343
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,354
V\ﬁthout me on the opening night,
of course.

344
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,757
And you take over on tour.

345
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,957
What counts is a strong presence.

346
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,879
What's said is meaningless
unless the right person says it.

347
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,433
For me, the only obstacle

348
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,990
is being afraid to let me down.

349
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,348
But you won't.

350
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,995
I won't let you down.
I'll drive you.

351
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,549
Say yes,

352
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,314
and then I can get back to writing.

353
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,476
Draw up a contract obliging me
to give you the play to read in 10 days.

354
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:09,272
You can still say no
if you thinkthe play isn't worth it.

355
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,275
Okay.
A contract between you and you.

356
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,789
You the writer and you...

357
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,752
No, between you and me.

358
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,753
Anyway, I don't believe you.

359
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,877
You're interested in acting.

360
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,033
At school and college,
there's always a smarlass teacher

361
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,035
who organizes lessons
for curious young girls,

362
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,156
only to seduce them, in fact.

363
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,428
- At college, there's a good one.
- Don't go.

364
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,034
You soon learn bad habits.

365
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,111
I can't help you
if you fool around with god knows who.

366
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,919
In the contract,

367
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,072
specify that you calmed me down.
Thank you.

368
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,432
She drives me nuts.

369
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,558
For so long now.

370
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,438
And I'll come with you.

371
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,036
You'll have the play in 10 days.

372
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,351
You keep the boy and replace Harriet.
She's too old.

373
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,235
We can't drop Harriet.

374
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,992
Only in Paris then.
Not on tour.

375
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,957
She wasn't lined up for the tour.

376
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,678
Put it in her contract.

377
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,069
Why can't she tour?

378
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,879
I just said,
she's too old for the role.

379
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,676
And she wasn't lined up for the tour,
so why argue?

380
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,669
How should I know.

381
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,877
- Call her to say it's all arranged.
- You call her.

382
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,989
There's always...

383
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,271
There's always a storm with her.

384
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,150
Why can't we meet without,
I don't know...

385
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,356
Serenity isn't the right word but...

386
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,035
I'm too old for this claptrap.

387
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,511
The girl upstairs
will be wonderful.

388
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,073
She'll take over the role
and reinvent it.

389
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,954
Who's the girl upstairs?

390
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,869
If I think of her,
I'll be able to write.

391
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,189
She's an actress?

392
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,590
No, a student.

393
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,273
Why? I may be wrong?

394
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,714
We all mess up.

395
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,073
She'll be ready.
You'll be the first to applaud.

396
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,913

fyou're seeing her,
cut Harriet some slack.

397
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,433
Sure, I'll get married.

398
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,959
September 26!
Let's all get married together.

399
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,278
I'm not seeing her.

400
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,351
- Do you plan to?
- No.

401
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,753
You want me married again?

402
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,989
Why not?

403
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,156
Break-up scenes are a pain.

404
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,553
I write to console.

405
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,552
There's enough pain out there.

406
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,518
Weaving patterns is interesting

407
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,035
only if you see the light through them.

408
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,754
I try to.

409
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,472
I made this room for you.

410
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,553
So you could flee me.

411
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,279
Whenever you wanted.

412
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,038
You left before it was finished.

413
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,149
Do you like it?

414
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,238
You collect children's beds?

415
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,152
At the start, on your face,

416
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,870
I managed to erase a small part
of your anxiety.

417
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,358
I can't anymore.

418
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,831
I give you nothing and you know it.

419
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,757
Why'd you bring me up here?

420
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,158
We go back too far
to enjoy seducing each other.

421
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,955
You only derive pleasure
from your audience.

422
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,835
You need it to put on a show,

423
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,389
to continue your actor's striptease.

424
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,675
You only believe what plays on stage.

425
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,111
How life plays out with me...

426
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,793
never interested you.

427
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,077
You didn't bring your actor here
to hurt me.

428
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,473
Your brought him
to put us to the test.

429
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,957
I sometimes forget
what you've become.

430
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,550
- That's not a game.
- It is.

431
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,833
We stopped playing ages ago.
Let's start again.

432
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,149
And nobody...

433
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,349
can play us off against each other.

434
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,631
If I can't love you...

435
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,754
what's the point?

436
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,911
You see us as a rematch.

437
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,672
I want to start afresh.

438
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,473
You're not dumb enough
to believe that crap.

439
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,271
Or are you getting carried away again?

440
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,714
What are you doing?

441
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,709
Beethoven.

442
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,031
String Quartet no.13.

443
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,596
If you can't love me, why bother?

444
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,359
When did you plan to tell me
about the wedding?

445
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,553
What cheek,
inviting your lover into my play,

446
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,272
imposing him upon me...

447
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,837
It's more than a lack of tact.

448
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,433
It's so unlike you.

449
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,512
You're out to destroy me.

450
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,869
September 26.
Is it true what he said?

451
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,234
Yes, it's true.

452
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,999
You want to kill me.

453
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,749
You don't need an audience.
Stop, please.

454
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,629
Why were we so destructive?

455
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,351
I appreciate the "we",
even if it's sweet-talk.

456
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,954
Destructively speaking,
I was always ahead,

457
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,234
according to you.

458
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,633
You invite me to go to Prague with you.

459
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:45,278
I can't because of rehearsals,
fittings, costumes...

460
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,998
Last minute, I cancel everything.

461
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,399
I race home

462
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,199
and you're already gone.

463
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,958
And for a whole week,

464
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,312
no news, nothing.

465
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,194
Silence.

466
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,236
You switch off your phone
and I don't exist.

467
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,274
As if I never existed.

468
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,672
Eventually, you come back
all sweetness and light.

469
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,159
V\ﬁth a gift even.

470
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,829
A very pretty Bakelite lamp
that somehow I don't throw in your face.

471
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,709
You're a monster.

472
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,669
Can you hug me
instead of conducting your orchestra?

473
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,158
A hug won't soothe anything.

474
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,231
That boy is a messenger of
reconciliation between you and me.

475
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,958
That's why you brought him.

476
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,315
Now he's brought you back to me,

477
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,595
he's gone.

478
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,719
He's more than that.

479
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,879
I do the kissing.

480
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:35,160
I miss you cruelly. I admit that.

481
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,754
But not as-was. Not like before.

482
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,308
I think of you.

483
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,994
Sometimes,

484
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:47,193
I wish you could hold me,
be nice to me.

485
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,829
Not as before,

486
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,072
not in the same way, not as-was.
No more as-was.

487
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,072
And most ofthe time...

488
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,791
I'd hate to be in your arms.

489
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,993
You seduced me,

490
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,149
stirred me...

491
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,153
Screwed me, too.

492
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,389
Never sank me.

493
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,515
You know that.

494
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,754
Our love was very powerful, yes.

495
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,399
And now,

496
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,548
if you fucked me,
you wouldn't gain a sliver of revenge.

497
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,396
He got a cab.
He arrives at the station.

498
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,073
The train pulls in.

499
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,116
Don't you start.

500
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,398
He's mad at you.
His exit was so you'd follow.

501
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,879
Now he looks a fool.

502
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,237
He thinks he doesn't love you.

503
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,033
He's proud of his exit,
but missing out on the play? Regret.

504
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,992
He hesitates.

505
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,518
He's quite capable of coming back,
no problem.

506
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,116
He's a great dancer.
You've no idea...

507
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,715
One step forward,
two steps back.

508
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,791
You need a good dancer.

509
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,190
When he turns on the charm,
you won't be able to resist.

510
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,475
He has no chance.

511
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,629
You'll see.

512
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,309
A more charming slut,
there's never been.

513
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:11,234
If he thinks he's in love,
does he steam out or come bac
C?

514
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,756
If he comes back,
he stays in the play.

515
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,275
He has a few beers and a sandwich.
He hasn't eaten all day.

516
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,749
I see him
taking refuge in the church.

517
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,309
No, not the church.
Nothing to see. Sinister.

518
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,232
He's in the café.
Where else?

519
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,473
Wondering how to come back
without losing face.

520
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,514
By beating me up?

521
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,238
Not very original.

522
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,030
- He'll be backthen?
- He'll be back.

523
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,634
As soon as he regains his composure.

524
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,433
He never lost it.

525
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,040
Can you imagine him
getting by without you?

526
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,829
Easily.

527
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,277
But I don't want to imagine it.

528
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:53,796
That would be unforgiveable.
Anything else, okay,

529
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,152
but he's on that train,
doing fine without you.

530
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,758
The girl upstairs
has potential as an actress.

531
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,915
Could you work with her in Paris?

532
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,109
Me?

533
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,158
Drama lessons?

534
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,598
You'll refuse the tour.
She'd make a good replacement.

535
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,436
You fall back on the girl
as my beau boards the train?

536
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:26,189
Don't worry, I doubt I interest her.

537
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,996
V\lhat'd you do if she's in love?

538
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,714
What would you do?

539
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,199
Can she get the better
of a guy like you?

540
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,032
Who loves the way you do?

541
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,838
What do you mean, the way I love?

542
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,356
- You know.
- No, say it.

543
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,195
Oddly.

544
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,756
She's inexperienced,
but has the right age and innocence.

545
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,433
And she has great presence.

546
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,273
You could adopt her
as a kind of pupil.

547
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,239
A disciple.
She'd be your spiritual child.

548
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,834
If you trained her, she'd be perfect.

549
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,471
It's up to you to adopt her.

550
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,992
Maybe she'd like that.

551
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,631
I don't need a spiritual child.

552
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,995
You don't want children anymore.

553
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,472
Why wouldn't I want children?

554
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,038
Having a child

555
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,713
means with me.

556
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,477
How about you go see the girl?

557
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,073
Not a word about me.

558
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,955
Ask her if Auguste interests her
in the short-term.

559
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,637
He hired you
for all the administrative shit

560
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,472
and you're doing his corrections.

561
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,634
It's more fun?

562
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,789
Yes.

563
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,472
Do you like his writing?

564
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,234
Yes, a lot.

565
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,877
I was happy to perform it.

566
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,558
And I was happy with him.

567
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,029
As well.

568
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,953
You could be happy with him.

569
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,398
I'm only 20 years old.

570
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,959
No, he is what he is.

571
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,595
He's handsome.

572
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,197
V\ﬁth the body of a 20-year-old.

573
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,275
Smarter than the students you meet.

574
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,279
You want life insurance?

575
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:01,508
I don't want anything.

576
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,478
What could I give him?
My youth?

577
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,395
Yes.

578
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,599
And your sparkle.

579
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,758
We're dead weights at my age.

580
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,390
Cute butt and firm tits, a godsend.

581
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,276
I don't think
I'm into him that way.

582
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,436
He says to me,

583
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,150
There's a girl been working for me
a few weeks.

584
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,195
Presence, youth, and so on.

585
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,952
Perfect for the role.

586
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,830
If only she can act a bit,

587
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,073
she can do the tour.

588
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,753
I couldn't replace you.

589
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,597
His offer of acting,
are you interested?

590
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,750
It's tempting, but I'm no actress.

591
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,194
I'm a student.

592
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,270
Acting never appealed to you?

593
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,278
Sure. I took a few lessons

594
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,396
at a local school, that's all.

595
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,999
It's enough for him.

596
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,634
You're screwed.

597
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,591
- Does he know?
- No.

598
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,395
Screwed.

599
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,672
Touring pisses me off.

600
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:19,354
You won't replace me,
the part is yours.

601
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,117
When I read the last draft,

602
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,114
it was obvious
it wasn't written for me.

603
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,239
Up until now,
reading his work,

604
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,393
I could see my footprints.

605
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,634
This time,

606
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,839
the more I read,
the more I disappeared.

607
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,077
I'm no longer in his sights.

608
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:52,909
Right now,

609
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:58,514
he's writing the role of a young girl,
more you than me.

610
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,954
He doesn't know me.

611
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,551
He's allowed to work you out.

612
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,393
He talks about you to me
as if he's in love,

613
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,799
but I'm not sure
he's come to terms with the idea.

614
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,838
If you accept the role,

615
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,033
maybe you'll accept
more than the role.

616
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,833
Does that scare you?

617
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,314
Being in love?

618
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,674
For instance.

619
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,316
I doubt anything will happen.

620
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:38,996
Especially with you around.

621
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,916
You have nothing to worry about.

622
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,872
He's easy to love,
but day to day, he's horrendous.

623
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,636
He asked you to talk to me?

624
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,993
Everything's in place
to form a little group.

625
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,116
We'll make him write plays
for three characters.

626
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,231
A young man, Théo,

627
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:13,439
and two women,
beautiful, intelligent, in love!

628
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,194
We'll give him scope to invent
a fourth character if he wants,

629
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:20,039
and our quartet

630
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,351
will play
with such intensity and emotion.

631
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,960
Our children will play in silence
in rehearsal.

632
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,153
And kiss backstage
during the performance.

633
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,633
will write brilliantly

634
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,870
with a fluency
he's never felt before.

635
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,117
I've never lived in a group.

636
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,633
You'll never be alone.

637
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,589
Théo and I
will live just next door.

638
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,235
As soon as you feel down,
we'll be there,

639
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,356
quicker than paramedics!

640
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:56,635
By the ramparts of Seville

641
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:58,472
At my friends’ Lilas Pastia

642
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,710
I'll dance the seguidilla

643
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,757
and drink manzanilla

644
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,438
Here's what awaits you...

645
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,629
He'll tell you
life's been hard on him.

646
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,430
You must deduce that it's my fault

647
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,398
and that he wants to find some light,

648
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,754
meaning a woman

649
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,794
who can reconcile him with humanity.

650
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,758
Humanity is him.

651
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,952
Heartless women are me.

652
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,917
Reconciliation
with the big wide world is you.

653
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,993
He'll place his hands
on your shoulders.

654
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,678
He'll look at you very profoundly

655
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,954
with the intense gaze
of a newborn baby.

656
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,196
And he'll ask you,
V\ﬁ

 you have a child with me?

657
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,199
Totally mesmerized,

658
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,638
you'll hear yourself say...

659
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,471
Yes.

660
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,434
I even replied,

661
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,999
Yes, thank you.

662
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,315
And we didn't have children.

663
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,236
My memories of the early days
are dazzling.

664
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,793
He was writing, he was happy,

665
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,198
and I was proud
to be making my contribution.

666
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,119
I'll let you get on.

667
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,035
I set it all out for your student,

668
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,396
as if we had never existed.

669
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,432
So that it's not an obstacle.

670
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,838
As if we no longer existed.

671
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,914
I'm afraid I may have belittled us.

672
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,758
Shit, it'll live forever.

673
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,836
You keep saying the opposite.

674
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,832
I have to resist you.

675
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,716
She's capable of playing the part,

676
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,634
don't you thin
C?

677
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,916
But I'm not sure
she'd be the right partner for you.

678
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:38,512
I came because I don't like
what we've become.

679
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,469
You...

680
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,873
All in the past tense.

681
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,553
Three days ago,

682
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,318
I was having a fine time dying,
in a cute little panic attack,

683
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,631
on a station platform in Paris.

684
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,958
To you and you alone,

685
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:44,191
I wanted to send a quick note.

686
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,909
Something like,
I'm dying at this very moment.

687
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,275
Dying-

688
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,669
Actually dying.

689
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,954
For real.

690
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,356
Suffocating.

691
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,919
Burst aneurysm imminent.

692
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:01,834
How to survive?
I know. By kissing you.

693
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,193
Why didn't you send it?

694
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,676
So he'd slyly read it at night?

695
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,314
I wrote it

696
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,313
and I didn't send it.

697
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,235
Send it to me
and stop burying us.

698
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,953
I want you alive.

699
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,277
I'd like more of you in my life.

700
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,832
Théo's crazy to love.

701
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:31,719
You too.

702
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,593
I like being
around people crazy to love.

703
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,230
And I'd really like
to have you all around me.

704
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,352
What about a threeway wedding?

705
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,554
It's already a disaster!

706
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,437
Just two of us is impossible.

707
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:52,599
I'm not good enough?

708
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,793
Fuck you then.

709
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,959
You're really getting married?

710
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,435
Yes.

711
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,195
And you claim I harass you every night.

712
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,112
Didn't you see my ass?

713
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,874
I saw myself in the hallway mirror.

714
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,951
You didn't say I had a big ass.

715
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,592
If he won't talk about your butt,
what use is he?

716
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,470
V\ﬁthout you,
I'm not sure I can do it.

717
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,357
Two of you
will be much better.

718
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,352
I know you'll get on.

719
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,709
Show me your big ass,
to see if we two still get on.

720
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:33,588
I don't want to fuck.

721
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,039
Show me your ass.

722
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,311
We were in a parking lot, fucking.

723
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,349
You heard a car door.
In under 3 seconds, you were dressed.

724
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,518
You left me by the car,
bare ass drenched in jism.

725
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,878
I was too busy laughing at you
to get mad.

726
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,434
If he came in now,
you'd leave me bare ass?

727
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,276
Yes.

728
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,873
We'd both fuck you,

729
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,632
like in a porn movie.

730
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,679
Who suggested marriage?

731
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,919
He wants us to get married.

732
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,588
You're for it?

733
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,355
No, not like a bastard.

734
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,878
Stop turning me on.

735
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,315
Stop it.

736
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:18,037
Or three of us, with the girl.

737
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,555
Three of us, five of us, and so on.

738
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,838
I like your ass.

739
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,433
You think that
after 3 years of constant goodbyes,

740
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,957
I can listen to crap like
"3 of us, 5 of us" without it hurting?

741
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,590
It's not crap.

742
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,277
I often feel a need for you.

743
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,510
I don't say so. I should.

744
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,790
In case you think
I want to come back,

745
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:57,433
I hold my tongue.

746
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,310
At last, the pretty smile
your mother gave you.

747
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,271
It's good to see it back.

748
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,757
So you're the girl upstairs?

749
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,429
I suppose so.

750
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:14,874
What are you doing?

751
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,429
The mail.

752
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:22,991
Isn't mail boring?

753
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,668
You don't Iookthat kind of girl.

754
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:47,630
Here...

755
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,270
What I've got without corrections.
I can't take it further.

756
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,076
When I can,
you can tell me what you think.

757
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,479
Be gentle with me.

758
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,349
What about your life?

759
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,238
Where's your life at?

760
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,833
It's your play.

761
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,111
That makes a meager life.

762
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,953
The lover's return,
that could amuse us.

763
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,717
What do you thin
C? Am I in love?

764
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,758
I get the feeling you're not.

765
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,875
You were a serial seducer once.

766
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,758
No, I'm not in love.

767
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,989
There are few takers for what I've got.
In fact, no takers.

768
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:37,071
In the mirror, I see a void.

769
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,232
What I've got is a total vacuum.

770
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,116
Don't despair,
you have potential.

771
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,397
You get over everything,
even Harriet...

772
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,709
so now you're ripe for the picking
by the girl upstairs.

773
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,677
You should introduce me.

774
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,078
I don't want you all
taking turns up there

775
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,549
and debating among yourselves...

776
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,309
Is she right for him?
Is she good in bed?

777
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,755
- I don't mean sex.
- Is she fuckable?

778
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,596
Do you have any idea
what happened in my absence?

779
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,993
Curiously, no one drove after me.

780
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,719
You didn't see anything?

781
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,558
I don't look out the window.

782
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,472
You live here?

783
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,678
I don't live with Auguste.

784
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,880
I meant sleep with,
not live with.

785
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,838
He's insufferable, apparently.

786
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,149
They all think...

787
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,673
Or sleep with him.

788
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,956
But nobody seems to care.

789
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,712
The mai
's your whole life?

790
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,598
Do you know who I am?

791
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:06,079
You're Harriet's friend and an actor.

792
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,794
When Harriet came up...

793
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,678
Why did she come up?

794
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,749
Auguste wants me
to do the play on tour.

795
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,679
In that case,
I want to do the play on tour, too.

796
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,039
The mail is a fagade.

797
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,949
I'm a student.

798
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,793
That's another fagade.

799
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,470
I really am.

800
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,198
She came up to kill you?

801
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,071
It felt like she was seducing me.

802
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:41,478
You don't like girls?

803
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,912
I'm not attracted to women.

804
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,354
Sure, but girls.

805
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,752
If they're pretty, young,

806
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,997
with small breasts, malleable...

807
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,233
Easy to dominate?

808
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,197
Yes.

809
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,918
No sense of initiative.

810
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,516
You can picture Harriet with a girl?

811
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,830
For a moment, I thought so.

812
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,355
And that girl couldn't be you?

813
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,999
I don't like women.

814
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,157
That's why I see you as a girl.

815
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,637
If I like women I'm a girl

816
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,234
because girls don't like women.
Confusing.

817
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,675
Ifyou see me as a girl,
am I pretty?

818
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:36,755
Yes.

819
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:39,519
I'm glad.

820
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,915
I'm a boy
who only likes women and girls.

821
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,479
Unlike you.

822
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,680
They're beginning
to doubt I'll be back.

823
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,950
People don't stop coming in and out.

824
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,590
V\ﬁth all these visitors,

825
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,716
if anything happens between us,

826
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,357
this office becomes the boudoir
in an erotic farce.

827
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:10,074
"Fancy that!"
Could be a real laugh.

828
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:18,511
Nothing's going to happen.

829
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,513
Perhaps they're the real story,
not me.

830
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:29,669
Why not?

831
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,718
The real story is Auguste and me.

832
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,239
Auguste and you?

833
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:48,915
You don't sleep with him.

834
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,511
You don't live with him either.

835
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,108
From afar,
that makes a real love story.

836
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:05,279
Auguste and you.

837
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,518
That seems pretty convincing.

838
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,992
This is where you kiss me.

839
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,437
Sol leave...

840
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:20,876
I sneak round the kitchen

841
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,152
and I make my comeback.

842
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,279
I hope to see them
intrigued by my return.

843
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,358
For my writing,

844
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:39,239
I get by
on my mind's nocturnal ramblings.

845
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:43,036
Can't afford to miss them.
Catch them and hold on

846
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,997
to see if they can be used

847
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,151
to show a little wit,

848
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,595
to seduce one more time.

849
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:52,076
I live off those scraps,

850
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:55,392
off my own excrement.
I'm as green as can be.

851
01:04:56,040 --> 01:04:57,678
No mess left behind.

852
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,359
The present returns.

853
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:22,753
I'm glad to see you.

854
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,511
We all bet you'd be back.

855
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,675
You'd like the three of us
to live together,

856
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:43,274
you, me and Harriet
in the same house?

857
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:46,593
No, not really.

858
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:54,873
She wants us to.

859
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,157
I said it was beyond me,

860
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,871
that I lack imagination.

861
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,155
I'm too old to experiment.

862
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,509
But if you're up for it,
I'd consider it as a solution.

863
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,196
We already have the house.

864
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,477
True, but a house without children
is nonsensical.

865
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,029
Feeding the birds,
chattering with them...

866
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,119
Down by the river.

867
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:29,999
In the woods.

868
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,433
I was waiting for you.

869
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:07,553
I was in the village café.

870
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,072
The radio was on loud.

871
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,997
Playing blasts from the past.

872
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:16,878
The owner knew all the words.
She was very impressive.

873
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:19,989
Yes, I know

874
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:23,790
her wa y of being mine

875
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,436
displeases you

876
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,789
Did you have a blast from the past?

877
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:37,872
Did you fuc
C?

878
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,235
No, but...

879
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,998
He does.

880
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,152
He caressed me.

881
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,595
All over?

882
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,159
Did you enjoy it?

883
01:07:58,320 --> 01:08:00,072
No, I didn't enjoy it.

884
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,069
It turned me on.

885
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,832
You left without me.

886
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:10,831
Who are you
to leave without me?

887
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,434
Who are you?

888
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,908
It's what you wanted.
Alone time with him.

889
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,474
So he'd caress me?

890
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,679
Maybe so.

891
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,673
He's a funny guy.

892
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:37,074
No time for lunch,
he just kicked me out.

893
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:41,953
That turned you on, too.

894
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:50,518
Won't you turn me on?

895
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:53,673
I don't thinkl feel like it.

896
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,592
You really feel like it.

897
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:58,711
I'm sure you feel like it.

898
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,599
You're right, but not here.

899
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:02,910
Not here.

900
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:06,875
You never fucked on a riverban
C?

901
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,470
I told Auguste
you were crazy to love.

902
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:15,755
That's right.

903
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,236
Because he's crazy to fuck.

904
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,992
Living together
means you fucking us each in turn?

905
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,757
I never want to be free of you.

906
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:49,198
I did your corrections.

907
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,431
- It reads better?
- Yes.

908
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,470
The last quarter goes nowhere.

909
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:10,271
Actors are complicated.

910
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,154
We need to sense,

911
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,675
Yes it's him or Yes it's her.

912
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,157
It's got nothing to do with acting.
You can do it.

913
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,273
If you accept
all the faith I have in you.

914
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,749
I was thinking about life with you.

915
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,479
Life with me.

916
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,478
Life with me...

917
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:02,997
That means...

918
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:06,992
everything together.

919
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,157
Work, plays, life.

920
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,149
Auguste...

921
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:41,154
I don't want

922
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,078
that with you.

923
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,519
Your caresses

924
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:05,276
are expert gestures.

925
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,348
Hold me.

926
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,153
Don't be gentle.

927
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:20,271
If it's brutal, it's sincere?

928
01:13:20,600 --> 01:13:21,999
No feelings?

929
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,471
I don't want your desire.

930
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,358
I'm talking about feelings.

931
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,994
I could talk about desire.

932
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:32,232
Desire's outdated? Disgusting?

933
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,391
I want another way with you.

934
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,993
Desire is sex?

935
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,513
So, no sex.

936
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,751
You're at a shitty age.

937
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:56,351
Torn between a tangled past

938
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,353
and a radiant future
supposed to last eternally.

939
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,229
But I'm alive,
I'm in the present, like a child.

940
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,070
I don't want to play with a child.

941
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,748
By dodging the issue of desire,

942
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,433
you raise it,

943
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,519
negatively.

944
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,239
Balling you, that's easy.
I'm in great shape.

945
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:26,234
I'll give you more orgasms
than you can take.

946
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:28,359
I'll give you migraines.

947
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,594
Your arm...

948
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,831
I should have ripped it out

949
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:39,000
and run off with it
to leave you in peace.

950
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,918
In a Japanese novel,

951
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:45,709
a guy hides under his coat
the arm a woman gave him,

952
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,075
most likely to get rid of him.

953
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,355
A girl way more generous than you.

954
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:04,951
That old need for consolation
becomes truly impossible to satisfy.

955
01:15:13,960 --> 01:15:16,918
Feel sorry for yourself, poor victim.

956
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:20,670
But above all feel sorry for you,

957
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:23,479
the inadequate, incapable invalid.

958
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,193
Inadequate to be touched.

959
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:29,876
Incapable of accepting the caress
of an outstretched hand.

960
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:36,079
Shut up, you old fool.
Stop rambling.

961
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,189
Your mind overheats,
but your heart's cold.

962
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:00,672
I'm a great actor.
I believe every word I say.

963
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,751
I forbid you to leave.

964
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:52,155
Stop it!

965
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:55,875
Enough. Cut it out
Calm down!

966
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:02,430
Calm down!

967
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,517
Under the same roof? No way.

968
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:34,755
Let it go!

969
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:38,519
I'm kidding.

970
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,919
Yeah, I'm kidding, too.

971
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,278
I'm a fool.

972
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:49,675
They force me
to make a fool of myself.

973
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:59,795
I should go and apologize.

974
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,233
Why don't you leave?

975
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,157
Okay, come with me.

976
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:13,994
Downstairs.

977
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,834

'

 apologize.

978
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:35,115
Can you tell them
I'm going to apologize?

979
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,111
That way, they'll come back.

980
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:39,679
We need to discuss the play.

981
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,433
I need to hear them.

982
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:43,753
My behavior's...

983
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:46,157
Harriet will sort things out.

984
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,837
Fatso'

 do us good.

985
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,793
Audition me.

986
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:12,709
Now.

987
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:22,709
Audition you?

988
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,910
Sorry, I'm cracked.

989
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,116
It's good to come back to work.

990
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:45,270
Even if I have complete faith
in Stéphanesjudgment.

991
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,109
Then I'll go.

992
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:54,312
I'll give you a scene I knocked up.

993
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,153
Something I wrote on the side.

994
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,314
The main character, Victor,

995
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:04,917
suspects Louis,
Gae

e's boyfriend of wanting to...

996
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,991
Odd idea, this audition.

997
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:15,832
It's not my doing.

998
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,278
Can you see if she's okay?

999
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,272
Come back for the read-through.

1000
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:34,035
It's nothing.

1001
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:37,074
Just Harriet
taking pot shots at pigeons.

1002
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:40,518
The living room is your playground.

1003
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,590
I'm Aya's husband. Can I have a word?

1004
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,994
They keep meeting.

1005
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,110
I know.

1006
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,111
- It doesn't worry you?
- No.

1007
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,558
I've never seen her so happy.

1008
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,311
An audition?

1009
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,835
 breathing in a bell jar.

1010
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:08,359
He's got nerve.

1011
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,035
They've got nerve!

1012
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,156
She has no beﬂer friend than me.

1013
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:15,233
We're in love
and going to have a child.

1014
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,832
I believe she's happy with me.

1015
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,960
Théo's funny.
The girl's a bit girlish.

1016
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,716
Théo, a touch less whimsy.

1017
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,996
Fanny, you have to be ironic.

1018
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,912
Don't let him dominate.

1019
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,758
The guy isn't capable of loving
anyone.

1020
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,031
And he's messing up my life!

1021
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,554
He's a sad Iitﬂe ﬁre
that warms no one.

1022
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:41,073
Keep him away from her.

1023
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,433
You've no idea
how helpful it would be

1024
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,636
if you were the person he needs.

1025
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,597
Between you and I,
no one needs me.

1026
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:50,915
I'm young.

1027
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:53,557
And he's a big fan of youth.

1028
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,919
He'll dump me
for a younger girl, not A ya.

1029
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,833
Breathing easier now?

1030
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,756
Anyway, I'm not with him for life.

1031
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:13,113
You won't end yours with her.

1032
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,429
Really, why?

1033
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,437
Why shouldn't we be for life?

1034
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,909
Why do you say such stupid things?

1035
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,117
I didn't come to see you.

1036
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,950
Besides a consolation kiss,
I don't see what] can do.

1037
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,628
With the tongue?

1038
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:29,718
Anyway, I don't want to.

1039
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:33,475
Good, very good.
We'll leave it there.

1040
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:34,677
That was good.

1041
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:40,189
Thank you.

1042
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,153
Did Théo get an honorable mention?

1043
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,319
I found it quite amusing

1044
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,994
and it'd be amusing
to work on it some more.

1045
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,593
Work's amusing.

1046
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,029
Very amusing.

1047
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:53,836
sorfY-

1048
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,073
First time I saw you,

1049
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:11,110
I thought I'd devote my life to you.

1050
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:15,793
You had no choice.

1051
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,637
After that, I fought against you,

1052
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:22,434
against my feelings.

1053
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:26,270
I sense that...

1054
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:30,836
everything's been unlocked inside
thanks to you.

1055
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:35,919
Now, it's yes.

1056
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,510
I forbid you to say no.

1057
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:47,038
I forbid you to think I'm foolish.

1058
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:49,758
You're not at all foolish.

1059
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:57,475
- I can give you everything.
- Yes, everything.

1060
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,479
My youth,

1061
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,277
my stupidity, also...

1062
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:05,635
Everything.

1063
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,994
Don't move! Don't ever move!

1064
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,590
You'll be a beautiful actress for me.

1065
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:37,872
What I wrote
without thinking of you works.

1066
01:26:38,040 --> 01:26:40,508
Perhaps you'd begun to permeate me.

1067
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:56,393
I was waiting for you.

1068
01:27:24,600 --> 01:27:26,830
I think I'll love Fanny very much.

1069
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:35,919
We're still crazy to love?

1070
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,472
My life is with Fanny.

1071
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:45,593
V\ﬁ

 you still love us?

1072
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,113
You, yes.

1073
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:48,988
Forever.

1074
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,038
I can love her.

1075
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,599
I'm sure of it.

1076
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:58,716
I love her skin,
her smile, her lips...

1077
01:28:01,120 --> 01:28:03,076
Her transparency.
Her transparent skin.

1078
01:28:03,240 --> 01:28:06,073
Everything she says
and how she says it.

1079
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,120
What am I doing?
What will I do with her?

1080
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:25,194
Like you.

1081
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,555
You kept falling in love with others.

1082
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:31,399
Me too, I admit.

1083
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:34,199
Like you said
"three of us, five of us..."

1084
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:38,839
V\ﬁth you, it was one more,
and then one more.

1085
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,350
No life together. I was excluded.

1086
01:28:41,520 --> 01:28:43,988
What happens ifl sit here like this?

1087
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,118
I want your child with Fanny.

1088
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,671
And my child with Théo.

1089
01:28:56,440 --> 01:28:59,000
I'd have said,
I want a child with Théo.

1090
01:28:59,160 --> 01:29:00,434
Then all the rest.

1091
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,671
Then, I want a child by you two.

1092
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:08,318
And a child with Fanny.

1093
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,471
We can cross-breed them later.

1094
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,029
They'll be very beautiful and smart,

1095
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,838
and very, very funny.

1096
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,036
We'll sell them for big money.

1097
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:20,554
She'll be scared, she'll get cold feet.

1098
01:29:21,480 --> 01:29:23,789
We'll wait for Fanny to get pregnant?

1099
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,272
I like Théo. He's a good actor.
I'd hate him otherwise.

1100
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,718
I knew you'd say that.

1101
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:39,555
Théo, go get Fanny.

1102
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:41,671
I'll go!

1103
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:06,555
They want you downstairs.
Okay?

1104
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,115
Fine.

1105
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:12,397
The reading went well.

1106
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:14,357
Auguste seemed happy with us.

1107
01:30:15,240 --> 01:30:17,151
Thanks by the way. You helped me.

1108
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:18,230
How come?

1109
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:24,959
It was good.

1110
01:30:28,280 --> 01:30:30,635
So the big story's you and him?

1111
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:32,955
That's right.

1112
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:36,799
Were you naked just then?

1113
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,150
Yes.

1114
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:45,356
Waiting for him
like a little pup ready to yap?

1115
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:49,115
Let's go down.

1116
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:51,951
This female side,

1117
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,759
you kept it hidden.

1118
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:56,151
It's very touching.

1119
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:58,749
Sorry, but that is terribly attractive.

1120
01:30:59,040 --> 01:31:01,793
I feel a sudden tenderness
I didn't feel before.

1121
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,554
That's very sweet,

1122
01:31:04,080 --> 01:31:06,150
but I don't need it.

1123
01:31:23,640 --> 01:31:27,155
We're going to play a game
where we all guess

1124
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,113
what our neighbor's thinking.

1125
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:31,271
I'll start with Auguste.

1126
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:34,238
How does one keep warm
alone in bed?

1127
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,033
Vae soli.

1128
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,557
Woe to he who is alone.
If he falls, no one picks him up.

1129
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:42,155
- I'm not thinking that.
- No comments.

1130
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,355
Very good!

1131
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,715
Now guess Fanny's thoughts.

1132
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,431
A glad heart is the life of man.

1133
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,830
Joyfulness prolongs his dreams.

1134
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,468
Can we have
a little less trashy poetry?

1135
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:02,713
What do you do if the one you love
doesn't love you?

1136
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,469
There's only requited love.
Bad question.

1137
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,790
No comments, I said.

1138
01:32:08,240 --> 01:32:11,710
There's no joy if life is too little.

1139
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,473
contemplates

1140
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:29,473
the blossom of the young cherry tree.

1141
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:30,590
Thank you.

1142
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,034
Harriet now...

1143
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:46,276
I need to feel

1144
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,635
the beating of other people's hearts.

1145
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:51,629
Not out of impulse.

1146
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,354
Just always.

1147
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,870
And the urge to kiss you.

1148
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:58,475
All of you.

1149
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,351
Yes to requited love.

1150
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:08,476
Harriet for Fanny...

1151
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,551
You're not the only one
who can kiss everyone.

1152
01:34:28,680 --> 01:34:31,752
What's going on here
goes over my head.

1153
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:37,915
If we're staying, we better buy food.

1154
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:40,753
We better buy dogs and some kittens.

1155
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:43,156
Hens, too, for their eggs.

1156
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:46,798
Eggs for the children,

1157
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,951
when they come along.

1158
01:34:58,480 --> 01:35:00,152
- I have to go home.
- Why?

1159
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,788
It's my mother's car. She needs it.

1160
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,788
AnywaY- --

1161
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,317
It's a bit complicated here.

1162
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:11,711
Harriet tried to kiss you.

1163
01:35:11,880 --> 01:35:13,233
Don't worry, forget it.

1164
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:17,637
Can't you stop loving
everyone and no one?

1165
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:46,394
Your hand's sulking.

1166
01:35:52,040 --> 01:35:52,916
If you want, I'll stay.

1167
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:55,958
Earlier, you wanted everything for me.

1168
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:59,710
If the first gust of wind blows us over,
we're a dud.

1169
01:36:00,800 --> 01:36:02,392
The kiss wasn't malicious.

1170
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,879
I know.

1171
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,315
- You really want me to stay?
- Yes.

1172
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,477
First, I have to go home.

1173
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,952
My hand says so.

1174
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:33,959
I'll pick you UP-

1175
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,474
I'm coming back.

1176
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:37,639
I'm sorry.

1177
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,354
What are you doing?

1178
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:47,116
C'mon, drive!

1179
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,475
- Stop it!
- Drive!

1180
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,031
You heard it. She slapped me.

1181
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,238
She's very playful.

1182
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,319
Very Playful!

1183
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:15,597
She's sincerity itself.

1184
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:17,872
It's vital to match her.

1185
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,871
Eyes on the road
when I talk to you.

1186
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:25,392
When I say sincerity,
she's also a compulsive liar.

1187
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,637
I need Harriet.

1188
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:33,238
Did you observe her?

1189
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,597
See the person she is?
I doubt it.

1190
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,317
You want to kiss all the girls?

1191
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,273
I love Harriet
and I love kissing girls.

1192
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,479
She'll be back after she gives in.

1193
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,071
You never could resist temptation.

1194
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,476
She's not like you. Screw you!

1195
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,956
Leave me alone,
I'm sick of talking.

1196
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,470
You'll never know if he kissed her.

1197
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:07,479
I'll see it.

1198
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:16,998
If there's any doubt,

1199
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:21,153
all three of you
had better clear out fast.

1200
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:25,549
And go get married together
wherever you want.

1201
01:38:29,560 --> 01:38:31,312
You're scared
she'll go back to him.

1202
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:35,235
Everyone knows they're through.

1203
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:38,111
They can't get on. Don't worry.

1204
01:38:38,280 --> 01:38:40,748
He acted like he wanted to,
but he didn't.

1205
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,354
He scared me, before I came here.

1206
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,272
Now it's fun alarming him.

1207
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,949
So if I don't kiss you...

1208
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:50,071
I won't let you out of my sight.

1209
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:51,311
The answer's no.

1210
01:38:51,480 --> 01:38:53,311
Not with your tongue.
It's nothing.

1211
01:38:53,480 --> 01:38:54,799
It's no, with or without.

1212
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,111
I want to kiss you.
Stop the car and let me kiss you.

1213
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,589
I'm stuck.

1214
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:03,749
You're not even hard.

1215
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:05,319
I didn't say "fuck".

1216
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:16,798
You're pretty,
but it's not you I need.

1217
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:19,758
I don't need you.

1218
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,036
I don't need you either.

1219
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:59,113
I'll call my mother later
about the car.

1220
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:10,870
Did your little beauty just go
upstairs?

1221
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:14,554
Can I go up one last time?

1222
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:19,152
I'd like to say goodbye.

1223
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,558
I won't scare her.

1224
01:40:25,480 --> 01:40:27,391
No more of your sacraments.

1225
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,150
It's not easy
leaving without you both.

1226
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:13,118
- Ready to go?
- Yes.
