00:00:09,993 --> 00:00:13,170
Get back here, ride the
prancing white horses.

00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,114
A free ride if you're over 60-

5
00:00:15,114 --> 00:00:16,824
- [Promoter] What is he, what is he?

6
00:00:16,824 --> 00:00:18,240
Is he man or is he woman?

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,015
It's amazing, it's
unbelievable, it's incredible!

8
00:00:21,015 --> 00:00:22,780
No one under the age of 21.

Knock a dolly!

You, sir?

a cute, little doll or
a box of chocolates.

00:01:21,452 --> 00:01:26,452
(blows thudding)
(crowd shouting encouragement)

36
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,488
- I'll double up, do you wanna double up?

37
00:01:38,488 --> 00:01:39,580
- Are you kidding?

38
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,198
The boy's getting the
snot knocked out of him.

39
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:43,505

(crowd shouting encouragement)
(blows thudding)

46
00:02:04,732 --> 00:02:05,919

00:02:14,515 --> 00:02:15,806
(blow thudding)
(fighter thudding to floor)

52
00:02:15,806 --> 00:02:18,556

(crowd booing)

61
00:02:39,383 --> 00:02:42,767
What are you, lover boy,
he wants to have a go too.

62
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:45,482
- [Man] It's a swindle.

63
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:47,794
(crowd shouting rowdily)

64
00:02:47,794 --> 00:02:50,434

(muffled announcer speaking)
(people chattering loudly)

68
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,558
(bag clattering)

69
00:03:18,558 --> 00:03:21,308
- [Announcer] For the Grand Slam.

70
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,475
(bag thudding)

71
00:03:25,475 --> 00:03:29,392
(background people chattering)

72
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:35,476
(cheerful jazz music)

73
00:03:54,437 --> 00:03:55,890
(Jack coughing softly)

74
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,443
- [Tommy] Are you alright?

75
00:03:57,443 --> 00:04:01,304
- [Jack] Oh, bit of a
cold, should be jake.

76
00:04:01,304 --> 00:04:04,471
(cheerful jazz music)

77
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:19,585
(truck rumbling)

78
00:04:19,585 --> 00:04:20,800
- Look, Jack, I'm sorry
about what happened

79
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,160
back there in the ring.
- Oh, it's alright.

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,743
No, it's bloody not, Tommy.

81
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:28,100
You always bugger things up, you know why?

82
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,901
Because you never pay attention,
that's why. (coughing)

83
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:32,760
- I was anxious, I thought
we'd make enough money

84
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,820
on them side bets to get a
little sideshow together,

85
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,710
you know, for ourselves.

86
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,080
- What, you die hard, mate.

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,130
Don't you ever listen to what I tell you?

88
00:04:41,773 --> 00:04:44,260
- I still reckon we could
get ourselves a knock a dolly

89
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,052
or a shooting gallery
or something like that?

90
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,012
- You reckon?

91
00:04:47,012 --> 00:04:48,972
- I mean, it's got everything,

92
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:52,500
regular income, no work to speak of,

93
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,283
get around the country,
see the local shows.

94
00:04:55,283 --> 00:04:57,492
- Oh, I couldn't stand the excitement.

95
00:04:57,492 --> 00:04:58,970
- You've got your freedom,

96
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,817
but you've still got
a roof over your head.

97
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:02,179
- I'm going to sleep.

98
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:05,175
(object tapping)

99
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:07,301
Look, for the last time, have a sideshow,

100
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,283
you've got to have a truck and equipment.

101
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:12,520
You have a shooting gallery,
you've got to have firearms,

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,110
rifles, that takes money, money

103
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:18,243
and that's something we
don't have plenty of.

104
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:23,719
- Oh, I don't know, reckon
we start it in a small way.

105
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:26,072
- Can't hear a thing you're saying.

106
00:05:26,072 --> 00:05:28,648
(fire crackling)
(cicadas chirping)

107
00:05:28,648 --> 00:05:30,481
- What about your tea?

108
00:05:33,518 --> 00:05:36,601
(soft melodic music)

109
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:48,019
(Jack breathing heavily)

110
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,686
(Jack coughing)

111
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,553
(soft melodic music)

112
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,219
(Jack coughing softly)

113
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,451
(birds chirping)

114
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:45,534
(soft melodic music)

115
00:06:51,086 --> 00:06:53,469
G'day, how you feeling?

116
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:57,347
- (coughing softly) Oh,
what the hell's this?

117
00:06:57,347 --> 00:06:59,547
- Oh, I tossed them
over you after I got up.

118
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,716
Another night out in the open,
you'll end up with pneumonia.

119
00:07:03,716 --> 00:07:05,766
When you feel better-
- I'll be alright.

120
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:09,502
(birds chirping)

121
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:15,176
(soft melodic music)

122
00:07:18,526 --> 00:07:22,502
(car rumbling quietly)

123
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:25,085
(door opening)

124
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:51,310
- Oh, morning, Sergeant.

125
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,241
- Mrs. Lohan.

126
00:07:53,241 --> 00:07:55,991
(birds chirping)

127
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:02,208
(background people chattering)

128
00:08:03,586 --> 00:08:05,343
What's with out in the yard?

129
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:06,610
- Hm?

130
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:09,660
- About 25, looks like
she's been around a bit.

131
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,784
- Oh, just a blow-in the missus hired.

132
00:08:11,784 --> 00:08:13,100
Help out in the kitchen, you know.

133
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,983
- She's a looker.

134
00:08:17,685 --> 00:08:21,103
I just heard the shearers are staying out,

135
00:08:21,103 --> 00:08:24,029
so I reckon you blokes
better think about moving on.

136
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:25,100
(man spitting)

137
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,933
Soon.

138
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:28,829
(men chattering)

139
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:32,107
- Who the hell does he
think he is anyway, ey?

140
00:08:32,107 --> 00:08:35,068
I'm not moving, I'm staying,
bugger him, I'm staying.

141
00:08:35,068 --> 00:08:36,194
(men chattering)

142
00:08:36,194 --> 00:08:38,030
- Hey, Kearney.

143
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,780
(birds chirping)

144
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,862
Look.

145
00:08:43,862 --> 00:08:46,529
(flies buzzing)

146
00:08:49,517 --> 00:08:52,767
(Jack coughing softly)

147
00:08:56,498 --> 00:08:59,165
(bags thudding)

148
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:04,148
(background men chattering)

149
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:08,306
- Hope you blokes are
just passing through?

150
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:10,176
- We're looking for work.

151
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:13,275
- Not around here, this lot
have been lying around for days

152
00:09:13,275 --> 00:09:14,277
waiting for the strike to end.

153
00:09:14,277 --> 00:09:16,513
They're running out of time too.

154
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,493
- He's not staying out again tonight.

155
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,218
(Jack coughing softly)

156
00:09:22,218 --> 00:09:23,833
- Where is he gonna stay?

157
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:30,210
In the police station,
there's plenty of blankets.

158
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,823
Not scared to swing an
ax, you get breakfast.

159
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,889
- Jeez, thanks, Sarge, that's good of you.

160
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:37,900
- My missus is working on
the tea stall, Mrs. Crow,

161
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,534
tell her I sent you.

162
00:09:39,534 --> 00:09:42,229
(dog barking)

163
00:09:42,229 --> 00:09:44,979
(birds chirping)

164
00:09:52,435 --> 00:09:54,033
- [Mrs. Lohan] I thought
I might give you a start

165
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:56,353
in the bar tonight.
- Oh, I'd like that.

166
00:09:57,529 --> 00:09:58,902
- Hey,

167
00:09:58,902 --> 00:10:01,051
that's nice.

168
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,244
Oh, it's only a maggot, isn't it?

169
00:10:03,244 --> 00:10:04,350
- Present.

170
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,350
- Ooh, someone must be very fond of you.

171
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,033
- Hardly knew him.

172
00:10:10,242 --> 00:10:12,461
(cockerel crowing)

173
00:10:12,461 --> 00:10:16,212
(chickens clucking)

174
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:18,470
- You need some sleep, you
reckon you'll be able to sleep?

175
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,090
- Yeah, I'll be alright.

176
00:10:22,427 --> 00:10:24,235
(dog barking)

177
00:10:24,235 --> 00:10:28,152
(background people chattering)

178
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:33,681
- [Man] Hello, hello, get a go of this.

179
00:10:33,681 --> 00:10:34,934
- Well, here she is.

180
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,851
Now you look after her.

181
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,749
- Ever worked behind a bar before?

182
00:10:40,749 --> 00:10:41,582
- No.

183
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:43,200
- There's a knack to
pulling a beer properly,

184
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,100
you'd better keep an
eye on me for a while.

185
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,631
- And we'll keep an eye on her. (laughing)

186
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:49,910
Give the lady a drink, Lohan on me,

187
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,523
what'll you have, love?

188
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,730
Come on, we get a bit
sick of having nothing

189
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,613
but the boss' ugly face to drink with.

190
00:10:56,613 --> 00:10:57,870
- No, thanks.

191
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,070
- Make it two then, if
the lady won't drink.

192
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,934
- Ta.
- Cheers.

193
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:06,767
- Joycie.

194
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:08,380
- Joycie?

195
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,760
I'm Keith, this is Dick.

196
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,507
- Pleased to meet you.

197
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,422
- Don't drink, ey?

198
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:19,357
No bad habits, Joycie, none at all?

199
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,813
Oh, sorry, did I hurt you?

200
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:26,479
Don't know my own strength, my trouble.

201
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:27,949
(glass tipping over)
- Oh!

202
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:30,596
(men laughing)
Look at this!

203
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:31,943
- Did I wet you, Dickie?

204
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:32,800
- Too right.

205
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,208
- Sorry about that, why don't
you take your mate's drink

206
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,163
and anything else he's got to offer?

207
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:42,948
You alright?

208
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:45,828
- Yes, thanks for the moment.

209
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:47,947
- [Man] Give me an old one anyday.

210
00:11:47,947 --> 00:11:49,647
- Always gotta rush it, don't you?

211
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:53,045
Take a bit of time, we
could've been in there.

212
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:56,724
Only got to use your eyes, she's a goer,

213
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:58,001
it's written all over her.

214
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:00,749
- [Man] Well, what about
the Vanguard? That's a car.

215
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:02,703
- [Man] (laughing) Bloody Vanguard?

216
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:05,081
- [Man] At least you can
get a couple of Sheilas

217
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,506
in the back seat.

218
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:09,779
(dog barking)
(cicadas chirping)

219
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,311
(steps creaking quietly)

220
00:12:12,311 --> 00:12:15,394
(soft melodic music)

221
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:21,466
(bottle clanking)

222
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:24,549
(soft melodic music)

223
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,513
(door opening)

224
00:12:45,702 --> 00:12:48,285
(door closing)

225
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:54,842
(Reggie burping)

226
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,795
- Wakey wakey, darling.

227
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,630
Reggie wants to play.

228
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:10,537
Cooee!

229
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:14,228
(Joycie screaming)
Stop it, stop it!

230
00:13:14,228 --> 00:13:16,635
Stop it, Lohan, your boss.
- I can see who you are.

231
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:17,585
- Stop, stop!
- Get out!

232
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:18,811
(light clicking on)
- What are you doing?

233
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:19,978
(light clicking off)
You'll wake the wife.

234
00:13:19,978 --> 00:13:21,314
(door opening)
- Go back to where you belong.

235
00:13:21,314 --> 00:13:22,740
- I'm going, don't make a fuss.

236
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,710
(door slamming)

237
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,789
(door opening)
What about my pants?

238
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:25,622
- Get!
- Ow!

239
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:26,576
(door slamming)

240
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:27,647
(door locking)

241
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,446
(dogs barking)

242
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:33,424
- [Woman] (whistling)
Shut up, you mongrels!

243
00:13:33,424 --> 00:13:36,546
(baby crying)

244
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:39,296
(footsteps ascending steps)

245
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:41,879
(dogs barking)

246
00:13:42,991 --> 00:13:46,074
(door creaking open)

247
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:49,815
(door closing)

248
00:13:56,402 --> 00:14:00,069
(Mrs. Lohan moaning softly)

249
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,472
- Oh, you randy, old goat, go to sleep.

250
00:14:13,188 --> 00:14:15,938
(Reggie sighing)

251
00:14:18,255 --> 00:14:21,718
(cow bellowing)

252
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:25,057
(water sloshing)

253
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:27,998
- Hey, did you get a
smell of that kitchen?

254
00:14:27,998 --> 00:14:28,923
(chickens clucking)
Come on.

255
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:32,701
- [Annie] I'll keep doing it,

256
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,398
because it's my Christian duty,

257
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:36,303
but I don't have to like
cooking for the drunks

258
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:38,760
and no-hopers you bring into my kitchen.

259
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,155
(knocking on door)
- It's open.

260
00:14:40,155 --> 00:14:42,261
(door opening)

261
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,567
- Morning.
(food sizzling)

262
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,253
- Morning.
(door closing)

263
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,154
- I think it's outrageous.

264
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:50,353
Police department's just taking advantage.

265
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:51,520
- [Keith] I get an allowance for it.

266
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,753
- Huh, not for my time
and effort, we don't.

267
00:14:53,753 --> 00:14:55,940
If it wasn't for simple,
Christian charity.

268
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,917
- You don't need to bother.
- I wouldn't do it.

269
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:58,884
Suppose it's the cross I have to bear.

270
00:14:58,884 --> 00:14:59,853
- Just sit down.

271
00:14:59,853 --> 00:15:01,547
- Bringing people in off the streets

272
00:15:01,547 --> 00:15:05,053
to make themselves at home in my kitchen.

273
00:15:05,053 --> 00:15:06,466
My chair.

274
00:15:06,466 --> 00:15:07,700
- Sorry.

275
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,225
- Oh, just stay there, it
doesn't matter where I sit.

276
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:11,301
- Should I move?

277
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:13,801
- Just sit down where you are.

278
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,879
- Bless us, our Lord in these times

279
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,530
by your bounty we're about to receive

280
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:22,030
through Christ our Lord, amen.

281
00:15:25,126 --> 00:15:27,491
Imagine how much wood I'll get chopped.

282
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:28,501
(ax chopping)

283
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:32,210
- What about one of those
ring the bell things,

284
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,950
where a bloke hits a thing with a hammer,

285
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,214
a little thing flies
up and rings the bell?

286
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:40,339
(wood clattering)

287
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:41,755
- Keep chopping.

288
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:42,886
(ax chopping)

289
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:45,093
- It wouldn't cost that much, would it?

290
00:15:45,093 --> 00:15:45,973
(ax chopping)
(chickens clucking)

291
00:15:45,973 --> 00:15:48,360
I don't know what you've got
against sideshows, Kearney.

292
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,193
- Alright.

293
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,361
You've earned your keep.

294
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:54,890
(wood clattering)

295
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,797
- Next town's Marynong, 20 mile that way.

296
00:15:57,797 --> 00:15:59,698
- Thanks for the tucker, Sarge.

297
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:01,898
- I'd appreciate it,
if you don't come back.

298
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:06,060
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

299
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,049
- I like to travel.

300
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,790
- Around here, it's a big deal

301
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,522
just to go into Marynong to church,

302
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:12,725
look forward to it all week, some of them.

303
00:16:12,725 --> 00:16:16,620
- Well, maybe they get, I don't
know, support from religion.

304
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,124
- Well, I'm not knocking religion.

305
00:16:18,124 --> 00:16:20,960
I'm a Catholic myself, almost.

306
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,793
Lohan is.

307
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:27,099
There's a young Catholic
priest over at Marynong now.

308
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:29,420
He's a nice boy, he's the one that started

309
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,876
this free sandwiches and tea

310
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,680
for the men who couldn't find work.

311
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,490
- [Joycie] It's a nice idea.

312
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,635
- It is.

313
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:38,462
(door closing)

314
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:39,728
(birds chirping)

315
00:16:39,728 --> 00:16:41,320
- Look at you, you're dead on your feet.

316
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,160
We ought to go back and see a quack.

317
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,813
- I'm alright.

318
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:46,040
- Oh yeah, you're great,

319
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,420
you old bull out to piss, couldn't you?

320
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,827
Where the hell you going now?

321
00:16:49,827 --> 00:16:52,237
- I'm gonna have a spell, use your brains.

322
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,118
(bag clattering)

323
00:16:58,118 --> 00:17:00,566
(bag thudding)

324
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:03,427
(birds chirping)

325
00:17:03,427 --> 00:17:06,677
(Jack coughing softly)

326
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:24,669
(gate rattling)

327
00:17:25,575 --> 00:17:28,658
(soft melodic music)

328
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,516
(gate screeching)

329
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:39,683
(cheerful jazz music)

330
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:52,990
(Jack coughing softly)

331
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,050
- Clean the place out a
bit, it won't be too bad.

332
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,633
What do you reckon?

333
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:02,563
- You get an agent's
commission or something?

334
00:18:03,993 --> 00:18:07,267
(cheerful jazz music)

335
00:18:07,267 --> 00:18:09,938
Well, if you're on the Titanic,

336
00:18:09,938 --> 00:18:12,893
it doesn't matter if you're
travel first class or steerage.

337
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,823
(bed clattering)

338
00:18:16,823 --> 00:18:18,240
- Bed an'all, ey?

339
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:26,059
(pots clattering)

340
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:26,892
Jeez!

341
00:18:28,248 --> 00:18:29,081
Get out.

342
00:18:30,117 --> 00:18:32,866
Go on.

343
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:34,457
Bloody thing.

344
00:18:34,457 --> 00:18:36,061
(cheerful jazz music)

345
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:37,894
There's a bloody, big.

346
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,551
(firewood clattering quietly)

347
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:56,718
(cheerful jazz music)

348
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:11,646
I'm going into town.

349
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:14,146
I've got to get you something.

350
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:23,963
I won't be long, Jack.

351
00:19:31,471 --> 00:19:34,554
(door creaking shut)

352
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,240
(birds chirping)

353
00:19:43,423 --> 00:19:46,039
Cold as an Eskimo's out there tonight.

354
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,080
Evening, gents.

355
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,933
- What'll you have?
- I'll have a beer, thanks.

356
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,663
Hey, boss, what's a bottle of port

357
00:19:52,663 --> 00:19:54,213
and a bottle of brandy worth?

358
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,010
- Oh, different prices, a couple of quid.

359
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:57,647
What, you feeling a bit crook, are you?

360
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:58,480
- It's my mate.

361
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,038
- Well, that'll fix him,
do you want them now?

362
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,270
- You haven't got any
half bottles, have you?

363
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:06,387
- Don't carry them, not the
way they drink around here.

364
00:20:06,387 --> 00:20:09,123
- Yeah, well, I'll leave
it for a minute, alright.

365
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:15,757
- Your shout, mate.
- Here we go again.

366
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,888
I think I'll probably knock off.

367
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:19,138
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

368
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,486
(coins clanking)

369
00:20:22,486 --> 00:20:27,486
(quiet background people chattering)

370
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,419
I was wondering if I could
buy a drink for the bar?

371
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:31,909
- [Man] Ey, one minute ago.

372
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:33,577
- [Man] You set them up,
mate, we'll drink them.

373
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:36,244
- [Man] You in the
casket or something, pal?

374
00:20:36,244 --> 00:20:37,472
(men laughing)

375
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:38,727
(cicadas chirping)

376
00:20:38,727 --> 00:20:42,650
(car rumbling quietly)

377
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,558
- You might just as well come with me.

378
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:46,835
- I'm going to the greasy spoon.

379
00:20:46,835 --> 00:20:48,470
(car door opening)

380
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,387
(car door closing)

381
00:20:54,457 --> 00:20:56,482
(car rumbling)

382
00:20:56,482 --> 00:21:00,232
(melodic church organ music)

383
00:21:06,914 --> 00:21:09,779
(coins clanking)
(hands thudding)

384
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,797
- No doubt about you, bloke,
I don't think I've won a toss.

385
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:14,596
- Same again for two bob?

386
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:17,929
- Well, how about we up the ante to say,

387
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:19,959
half a quid?

388
00:21:21,102 --> 00:21:22,931
- I don't know.

389
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:26,375
- You've got to give a man a
chance to get his money back.

390
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,820
- You do a lot of this, do you?

391
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,240
- Do what?

392
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,150
- Set up suckers with a few little losses,

393
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,060
then jack up the ante.

394
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,691
- Hey look, we're playing
a nice, friendly game.

395
00:21:35,691 --> 00:21:36,643
- Yeah, well,

396
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:41,270
don't think we haven't enjoyed it.

397
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,870
- If you bastards think
you can take a man-

398
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:44,170
- What did you call me?

399
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,586
- Hold you ba-
(hockey stick thudding loudly)

400
00:21:45,586 --> 00:21:48,945
(glass shattering)

401
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:51,751
- I've never hit anyone
with this thing yet.

402
00:21:51,751 --> 00:21:54,193
I usually just bar anyone
that wants to fight.

403
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,250
So you two, over there

404
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,237
and you, down here.

405
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,938
If you're after a quiet,
peaceful drink, you can have it,

406
00:22:02,938 --> 00:22:04,098
- You tell them, Lohan.

407
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:04,931
- Otherwise.
(hockey stick thudding loudly)

408
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:07,480
- [Man] Piss off, Lohan,
you made me miss my shot.

00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:33,455
that makes him unclean,
poor from the inside.

415
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:36,045
From a man's heart come the ideas,

416
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:39,290
which lead him to do immoral things,

417
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,843
to rob, kill, commit adultery.

00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,703
- Is that all you drink?

422
00:23:49,703 --> 00:23:52,664
The boys have got a couple
of bottles in the car,

423
00:23:52,664 --> 00:23:55,925
I could borrow one.
- Could you?

424
00:23:55,925 --> 00:23:57,758
- Well, buy one maybe.

425
00:23:58,835 --> 00:23:59,701
- What for?

426
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:01,089
- Take down the river.

427
00:24:01,089 --> 00:24:03,950
You've got a car, haven't you?

428
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,359
- Yeah, I've got a car.

429
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:07,192
- Want to?

430
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:11,574
- No.

431
00:24:11,574 --> 00:24:12,743
- Scared of wifey?

432
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:15,358
Bet she's away somewhere,

433
00:24:15,358 --> 00:24:18,343
else why would you be
eating dinner by yourself?

434
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:20,980
- Why don't you sit down?

435
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,397
(cheerful melodic music)

436
00:24:25,232 --> 00:24:27,683
- I like men, boys know nothing.

437
00:24:29,286 --> 00:24:32,090
- My wife's not away, she's at the church.

438
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:35,832
I'm waiting to take her
home to Cedar Creek.

439
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:37,563
I'm the Police Sergeant there.

440
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:39,798
- Whoops.

442
00:24:56,637 --> 00:24:58,054
Goodnight, Sarge.

443
00:25:00,157 --> 00:25:02,740
(all laughing)

444
00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:07,214
(coins clanking)

445
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,297
- Hey, Lohan.

446
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:12,907
Let us know when it's charity
night again, will you, ey?

447
00:25:14,684 --> 00:25:17,017
- Hey, aren't you gonna shift, Unger?

448
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,813
- Come on.

449
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,141
- [Man] Better make this the last game.

450
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:26,510
- Not exactly crash hot
as a conman, are you?

451
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,873
- I wasn't conning anyone.

452
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,048
- Sorry.

453
00:25:33,048 --> 00:25:36,483
- (laughs) Oh, yeah?

454
00:25:36,483 --> 00:25:39,133
- They were onto you all the time.

455
00:25:39,133 --> 00:25:42,380
- I was a bit anxious, I
need to make a quid fast.

456
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,615
My mate's crook, I wanted to
get him some brandy and port.

457
00:25:44,615 --> 00:25:46,042
- Some what?
- Port wine and brandy,

458
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:47,810
you mix a tod of each of them together.

459
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:50,210
- What's he got, for
God's sake, the mange?

460
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,043
- Flu, I think.

461
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:53,424
- What, are you trying to
put him down painlessly?

462
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:54,658
(Tommy laughing)

463
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:56,370
Look, I wouldn't worry about the port,

464
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,870
but the brandy might help.

465
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:59,231
- Drink up, gents, past time.

466
00:25:59,231 --> 00:26:01,113
- Right, I'll have a bottle, thanks.

467
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,453
- Mr. Lohan, this gentleman
wants a bottle of brandy.

468
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:08,668
One for the road?
- Yeah.

469
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:13,290
- Hurry.
(glasses clinking)

470
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:16,165
- I spoke to you last
night, my name's Tommy,

471
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,689
Tommy Martin.

472
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:19,214
- Joycie.

473
00:26:19,214 --> 00:26:20,047
- Just Joycie?

474
00:26:20,047 --> 00:26:21,633
- Is that enough?

475
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:30,887
- You're a very pretty girl,

476
00:26:30,887 --> 00:26:33,287
got a sort of look about you.

477
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:35,450
- Oh, yeah?

478
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,743
- You know,

479
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,332
ladylike.

480
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,437
- (laughs) Thanks, I think.

481
00:26:42,437 --> 00:26:43,930
- It's just gone closing time,

482
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,368
I thought I might walk
you home or some way.

483
00:26:47,368 --> 00:26:49,726
- You know what I think?

484
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:53,309
I think you'd better
get back to your mate.

485
00:26:56,392 --> 00:26:57,438
(coins clanking)

486
00:26:57,438 --> 00:27:00,122
- You're about halfway there,
it's 12 and six a bottle.

487
00:27:00,122 --> 00:27:01,370
- Can I owe you the rest until-

488
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,920
- Give it to the missus.

489
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,670
Tell her to stick it back in stock.

490
00:27:09,881 --> 00:27:13,167
Finish your drink, we're closing.

491
00:27:13,167 --> 00:27:14,147

492
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:17,749

494
00:27:25,872 --> 00:27:27,789
- Nice service, was it?

495
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,627
- It was very moving.

496
00:27:34,807 --> 00:27:36,933
Please don't do that, Keith.

497
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,469
- Yeah, ta.
(dog barking)

498
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:47,100
- How about one for the road?
- Thank you.

499

Lohan, you can owe me for it.

a look at him, would you?

00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,353

(Jack moaning softly)

520
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:22,043
- You didn't say he was this
bad, he should have a doctor.

521
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:23,761
- Tell him that, he won't listen.

522
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:24,623

out here in this rat hole.

524
00:29:27,942 --> 00:29:28,930
- [Tommy] Well, I didn't know,

525
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,817
I had to get the brandy, didn't I?

526
00:29:30,817 --> 00:29:32,010
- Get the fire going

527
00:29:32,906 --> 00:29:34,303

529
00:29:36,389 --> 00:29:37,800
Got any rags?

530
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,633

531
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:40,090

- I come from a big family.

533
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:46,967
(cork popping)

534
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:49,456
(water running)

535
00:29:49,456 --> 00:29:51,200
(cicadas chirping)

536
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,483
- Oh, shit!

537
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,610
Bloody hell!

538
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,907
(water pouring)

539
00:30:12,556 --> 00:30:15,389
- Come on, just a little bit more.

540
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:21,378
(water running)

541
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:31,919
(Jack breathing heavily)

542
00:30:33,262 --> 00:30:37,095
(Jack shivery moaning softly)

543
00:30:42,054 --> 00:30:45,137
(soft melodic music)

544
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,928
(bed creaking)

545
00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:10,943
(firewood clattering quietly)

546
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:13,693
(fire crackling)

547
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,708
- [Tommy] Joycie?

548
00:31:21,522 --> 00:31:23,860
- I left you a blanket.

549
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,313
He's warm enough, if you want another one.

550
00:31:26,313 --> 00:31:28,447
- No, no, it's alright.

551
00:31:28,447 --> 00:31:31,530
(soft melodic music)

552
00:31:55,518 --> 00:31:58,185
(Keith snoring)

553
00:32:05,318 --> 00:32:07,901
(bed creaking)

554
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:12,167
- Hm, g'day.

555
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,430
- It's been a long day, Keith,

556
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,743
I've just come back from church.

557
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,090
- What's that got to do with it?

558
00:32:24,022 --> 00:32:27,173
- It's Lent, we should
all practice restraint,

559
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,773
- It's been Lent for three months.

560
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,813
Jesus Christ.

561
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,527
- And that's blasphemy.

562
00:32:45,391 --> 00:32:46,653
Goodnight, Keith.

563
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:49,824
Keith?

564
00:32:49,824 --> 00:32:50,824
- Goodnight.

565
00:32:59,971 --> 00:33:04,971
(Jack breathing wheezily)
- Ssh, ssh, ssh!

566
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:07,374
Ssh, ssh, ssh!

567
00:33:07,374 --> 00:33:08,624
You're alright.

568
00:33:09,463 --> 00:33:11,830
(Jack breathing wheezily)

569
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,793
Ssh, ssh, ssh!

570
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:15,397
(birds chirping)

571
00:33:15,397 --> 00:33:17,492
(water running)

572
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:20,242
(water sloshing)

573
00:33:49,516 --> 00:33:51,408
Oh, you're awake.

574
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:52,575
- [Jack] Yeah.

575
00:33:53,918 --> 00:33:55,820
- Feeling better?

576
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,963
- Yeah, fine, fit as a trout.

577
00:33:57,963 --> 00:33:59,777
- Just not much here to eat.

578
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:04,607
Let me help.

579
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:07,524
(plate clattering)

580
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,523
How do you feel?

581
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,833
- Fine, slept pretty well.
- I know.

582
00:34:31,496 --> 00:34:34,240
(birds chirping)

583
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,250
- Were you here all night?

584
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:37,083
- Most of it.

585
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:41,615
- Was I delirious last night?

586
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:43,783
- No, I wouldn't think so, why?

587
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,288
- Well, I had this sort of dream.

588
00:34:48,288 --> 00:34:49,121
- Really?

589
00:34:50,606 --> 00:34:52,915
Now you promise to stay in
bed till it warms up a bit,

590
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:54,490
later on, you can sit in the sun, right?

591
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,852
- Right.

592
00:34:55,852 --> 00:34:57,252
- I'd better feed your mate.

593
00:34:59,707 --> 00:35:01,293
By the way, I'm Joycie.

594
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,723
- Right.

595
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:06,518
- Tommy!

596
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:07,443
- I'm here.

597
00:35:07,443 --> 00:35:08,447
- [Joycie] Breakfast's ready.

598
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:10,739
- I usually get my own.
- It's on the table.

599
00:35:10,739 --> 00:35:13,120
I'm going down the
creek to clean up a bit.

600
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,133
- Yeah, I would.

601
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:17,539
- You've got a nice sense
of humor, you know that?

602
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,285
(birds chirping)

603
00:35:29,022 --> 00:35:31,533
(firewood clattering to floor)

604
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:33,983
- (sniffs) Stew's burnt.

605
00:35:35,005 --> 00:35:36,245
- No, it's okay.

606
00:35:36,245 --> 00:35:37,733
- I reckoned you'd think so.

607
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:40,883
- What's biting you?

608
00:35:40,883 --> 00:35:42,406
- Nothing, should there be?

609
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,940
- I don't know, is there?

610
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,597
- I'm bloody disgusted, that's all.

611
00:35:45,597 --> 00:35:47,510
- What about?
- You,

612
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,530
man your age and a young girl like that,

613
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:53,864
(Jack laughing)

614
00:35:53,864 --> 00:35:56,460
- Well, what do you know?

615
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,093
- You make me sick.

616
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:07,522
(sheep bleating)
(birds chirping)

617
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:09,824
- I'd better get to work.

618
00:36:09,824 --> 00:36:12,040
- Oh, that's alright,
I can look after him.

619
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,602
I want to thank you for
helping him last night.

620
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:15,519
- Pleasure.

621
00:36:16,494 --> 00:36:20,674
- I told him off, you
know, for taking advantage.

622
00:36:20,674 --> 00:36:22,272
- Oh, yeah?

623
00:36:22,272 --> 00:36:24,373
- He's just a bit delirious, you know?

624
00:36:24,373 --> 00:36:27,280
I don't really think he
knew what he was doing.

625
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,874
- Right, I'll get my things.

626
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:32,346
Do you want to walk me back to town?

627
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:37,220
- Righto.

628
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,783
(tools clanging)

629
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:41,581
(background people chattering)

630
00:36:41,581 --> 00:36:43,039
- Oh, thanks, darl.
- Please help yourselves

631
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,220
and here's a cup of tea.
- Great.

632
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:47,176
- [Man] Thank you, my love.

633
00:36:47,176 --> 00:36:48,855
Thanks a lot.

634
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:51,855
Drop of milk.
- Would you like sugar?

635
00:36:52,745 --> 00:36:54,063
- What do I owe you?

636
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:56,783
Kearney had a bit stashed
away in his camping kit.

637
00:36:59,644 --> 00:37:02,227
(door opening)

638
00:37:06,314 --> 00:37:08,940
- [Mrs. Lohan] He's
packed your bag, Joycie.

639
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,670
- Why?
- Well, he got all worked up,

640
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,118
when I told him about you
buying the bottle of brandy

641
00:37:12,118 --> 00:37:14,890
for that young blood and then
when you didn't come home

642
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,518
last night, he jumped to conclusions.

643
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:19,360
- Well, his mate was sick,
I was looking after him.

644
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,270
- Oh, don't tell me, love,
it's none of my business.

645
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,430
All I know is Lohan's
got the knife into you

646
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,373
for some reason.

647
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:29,754
What happened?

648
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:31,900
Well, I could make a fuss,

649
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,474
tell him that he has to keep you on,

650
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,019
if that's what you want.

651
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,602
(car rumbling)

652
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,227
- Here you go, darling,
this is your lucky day.

653
00:37:49,421 --> 00:37:52,421
(car engine idling)

654
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:59,041
(car door closing)

655
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:04,733
(car door opening)

656
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:06,543
(kick thudding)
(man thudding to ground)

657
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:09,964
(lively melodic music)

658
00:38:09,964 --> 00:38:11,547
- You wanna try it?

659
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:17,165
I didn't think so.

660
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,361
- [Man] Come on, let's go.

661
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:28,279
(car doors closing)

662
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:30,862
(car rumbling)

663
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,200
(birds chirping)

664
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:51,067
- G'day.

665
00:38:58,082 --> 00:39:01,082
(suitcase thudding)

666
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:03,094
- What a mess.

667
00:39:04,703 --> 00:39:06,518
- Looks like she's moving in.

668
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:07,542
(pots clattering)

669
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,150
- Just for a couple of days.

670
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:13,566
- Where's she gonna sleep,
as if I didn't know?

671
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:16,820
- Look, what do you want me
to do, tell her to buzz off?

672
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:20,277
- No, just bloody well
behave yourself, that's all.

673
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:37,367
- You blokes old enough to be in here?

674
00:39:37,367 --> 00:39:38,541
- [Man] Yes, sir.

675
00:39:38,541 --> 00:39:40,071
- G'day, Sarge.

676
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:42,892
- Lohan, see you lost the new girl?

677
00:39:42,892 --> 00:39:44,711
- Yeah, well, you heard
what she got up to?

678
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:46,037
Shacked up with those-
- I heard.

679
00:39:46,037 --> 00:39:48,238
- Well, I had to let her go.

680
00:39:48,238 --> 00:39:50,988
Can't have a tart behind the bar.

681
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:53,043
Can you?

682
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,191
Thanks.

683
00:39:56,191 --> 00:39:59,220
- If she shows up again,
I want to know about it.

684
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,680
Or those two blokes she's with.

685
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,833
- Yeah, sure.

686
00:40:12,134 --> 00:40:17,134
(fire crackling)
(soft melodic music)

687
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:20,258
(firewood clattering quietly)

688
00:40:20,258 --> 00:40:21,944
- Why aren't you in the cot?

689
00:40:21,944 --> 00:40:23,772
- Just thought I'd sit up for a while.

690
00:40:23,772 --> 00:40:25,647
- End up bloody sick again, I suppose.

691
00:40:25,647 --> 00:40:29,187
- He's right, we should all
be in bed, no arguments.

692
00:40:33,447 --> 00:40:35,530
- Hey, fair go, shouldn't
you be doing that outside?

693
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,993
- He's not getting
undressed out in the cold.

694
00:40:37,993 --> 00:40:40,097
- Haven't you two got any bloody modesty?

695
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:41,800
Ripping your clothes off like...

696
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:47,034
I'm going outside, give us a
yell, when you've finished.

697
00:40:47,034 --> 00:40:49,489
(both laughing)

698
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,739
(gentle melodic music)

699
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:02,389
(Jack and Joycie laughing)

700
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:23,912
(Tommy coughing)

701
00:41:23,912 --> 00:41:26,483
(door opening)

702
00:41:26,483 --> 00:41:29,566
(soft melodic music)

703
00:42:11,578 --> 00:42:12,495
Smart arse.

704
00:42:18,634 --> 00:42:21,301
(water running)

705
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,742
(both laughing)
- Let me get him out.

706
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:29,791
(water splashing)

707
00:42:29,791 --> 00:42:33,146
(birds chirping)

708
00:42:33,146 --> 00:42:34,609
(water sloshing)

709
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:35,692
Here you are.

710
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:42,170
- You've got to get as much
mud out of them as you can.

711
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,032
Here, look at the size of that one.

712
00:42:44,032 --> 00:42:45,736
(Joycie laughing)

713
00:42:45,736 --> 00:42:48,420
- [Joycie] You know what I reckon?

714
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,590
Fruit picking would be the answer.

715
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,827
- Do you reckon you could handle it?

716
00:42:52,827 --> 00:42:56,363
It's pretty tough,
physical work and dirty.

717
00:42:57,503 --> 00:42:58,930
- There's worse

718
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,481
and dirtier.

719
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:04,710
- Yeah, I suppose there is.

720
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,660
- And I've done it.

721
00:43:08,807 --> 00:43:10,260
You know what I've been?

722
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,657
A prostitute.
- I think I know everything,

723
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:14,538
that's important to
know about you, Joycie.

724
00:43:14,538 --> 00:43:17,700
(water sloshing)

725
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,617
It's not what a person's been,

726
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:21,213
it's what you are that counts.

727
00:43:22,974 --> 00:43:25,262
They say confession is good for the soul.

728
00:43:25,262 --> 00:43:29,807
Don't you believe it, mostly
it's a pain in the arse.

729
00:43:31,337 --> 00:43:34,087
(birds chirping)

730
00:43:35,563 --> 00:43:37,099
I've been thinking,

731
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:39,669
there's a fair chance this is crown land.

732
00:43:39,669 --> 00:43:43,229
More than likely we could stay
here as long as we wanted.

733
00:43:43,229 --> 00:43:44,173
- Probably.

734
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,560
- Well, I was wondering how you'd feel,

735
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,630
if I was to ask Joycie to stay on too?

736
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,203
- What have you got in mind?

737
00:43:52,203 --> 00:43:54,370
You're not thinking of taking
advantage of that girl,

738
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,557
are you, just because-
- Now, listen, Tommy,

739
00:43:55,557 --> 00:43:57,824
all I'm saying is we'll
tell her she can stay,

740
00:43:57,824 --> 00:43:59,033
if she wants to.

741
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,963
Alright, that's all.

742
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,653
- So long as that's all you're saying.

743
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,343
(soft melodic music)

744
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:26,527
- [Joycie] You beat me to it.

745
00:44:26,527 --> 00:44:28,163
- [Tommy] Come in anyway.

746
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:38,825
- I think I'll just wait a little while.

747
00:44:38,825 --> 00:44:41,380
- You're not gonna watch me wash, are you?

748
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,355
- Why not, are you shy?

749
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:44,677
- No.

750
00:44:44,677 --> 00:44:46,510
Where's Jack?

751
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,203
- Resting, he still
needs building up a bit.

752
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,160
- Bit fond of him, aren't you?

753
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,729
- Yeah, I suppose I am.

754
00:44:54,729 --> 00:44:56,863
He makes me laugh, that's pretty rare.

755
00:44:57,834 --> 00:45:00,474
(water splashing)

756
00:45:00,474 --> 00:45:03,557
(soft melodic music)

757
00:45:07,096 --> 00:45:09,300
You're pretty, you know that?

758
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,133
- What?

759
00:45:11,255 --> 00:45:12,847
- I said you're pretty.

760
00:45:14,477 --> 00:45:17,560
(soft melodic music)

761
00:45:34,557 --> 00:45:37,307
(birds chirping)

762
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:42,194
(fire crackling)

763
00:45:47,782 --> 00:45:49,200
What have I done?

764
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,750
- I'll go and get some water.
- No, you stay here.

765
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,353
We want to say something, ask
you something. (clears throat)

766
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:07,780
We were saying that we all
seem to get along well together

767
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,563
and you think we're alright too,

768
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:16,013
we feel the same about you.

769
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,613
- It's okay to stay, if you want to.

770
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:28,332
- On one condition.

771
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:29,743
- You mean you will?

772
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,791
- The first sign of jealousy,
if you ever fight over me,

773
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:38,223
for whatever reason,

774
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,213
I go.

775
00:46:41,665 --> 00:46:42,513
Alright?

776
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:46,333
- Right.

777
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:49,441
- Alright?

778
00:46:50,568 --> 00:46:51,401
- Right.

779
00:46:55,888 --> 00:46:58,160
- Because I wouldn't want
you to change or anything

780
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,010
on account of me.

781
00:47:01,283 --> 00:47:04,533
(lively melodic music)

782
00:47:06,212 --> 00:47:07,478
- Got hold of it?
- Yeah.

783
00:47:07,478 --> 00:47:09,857
(hammer tapping)

784
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:12,190
- How's that?
- Beauty, mate.

785
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:16,582
- Oh!

786
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:23,407
- "I wouldn't want you
to change or anything

787
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,907
on account of me."

788
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:30,519
(Tommy laughing)

789
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,769
(lively melodic music)

790
00:47:53,379 --> 00:47:54,462
You bell end.

791
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,616
- Well, there's a few things
we need, kero, tea, sugar.

792
00:48:06,616 --> 00:48:09,290
- We'll get anything you need.
- I'll get you some money.

793
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:10,123
- No.

794
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,416
- It's silly, if I've got
money, I ought to pay my share.

795
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:16,357
- No, Tommy's right, we
can't take your money.

796
00:48:16,357 --> 00:48:18,307
But we might borrow a few bob for bait.

797
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:27,510
(shopping list rustling)

798
00:48:28,952 --> 00:48:30,049
(balls clicking)

799
00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:31,866
(potted ball thudding)

800
00:48:31,866 --> 00:48:34,100
- [Tommy] How about a chance to get even,

801
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,650
up the stakes a bit?

802
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,580
- Oh, I don't know, I'm not
much of a player anyway.

803
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:40,257
- I'm not talking about a fortune.

804
00:48:40,257 --> 00:48:41,090
(balls clicking)

805
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:43,220
Let's say, ah, say five bob a head?

806
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,250
- How about a quid a head?

807
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,320
- This is a private game.

808
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:50,602
- What do you reckon, Donno,
accept these blokes' challenge?

809
00:48:50,602 --> 00:48:52,873
Us against them.
- Quid a head.

810
00:48:54,547 --> 00:48:57,330
- You've gotta be joking, this
bloke can't play for peanuts.

811
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:58,360
- I beat you.

812
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,744
- Just keep it honest.

813
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:03,866
We'll have Lohan here hold the stakes.

814
00:49:03,866 --> 00:49:07,783
(background people chattering)

815
00:49:12,494 --> 00:49:15,018
- [Man] What about a water diviner?

816
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,744
- [Man] Bloody water diviner,

817
00:49:16,744 --> 00:49:19,494
you blokes think it's drying out.

818
00:49:20,455 --> 00:49:23,070
- These two seem a bit confident.

819
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,605
- Just think balls.

820
00:49:24,605 --> 00:49:26,188
- Just think balls.

821
00:49:29,162 --> 00:49:30,236
(balls clicking)

822
00:49:30,236 --> 00:49:33,486
(potted ball thudding)

823
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:41,257
(balls clicking)

824
00:49:43,087 --> 00:49:44,337
Sorry, partner.

825
00:49:45,865 --> 00:49:47,782
- Thank you, gentlemen.

826
00:49:52,308 --> 00:49:53,288
(balls clicking)

827
00:49:53,288 --> 00:49:56,538
(potted ball thudding)

828
00:50:03,703 --> 00:50:04,758
(balls clicking)

829
00:50:04,758 --> 00:50:08,008
(potted ball thudding)

830
00:50:12,504 --> 00:50:15,363
(balls clicking)

831
00:50:15,363 --> 00:50:16,493
It's all yours.

832
00:50:23,423 --> 00:50:25,563
- What do you reckon, what's on?

833
00:50:26,979 --> 00:50:29,746
- It'll be closing time
in a couple of hours.

834
00:50:29,746 --> 00:50:31,793
You want us to come back tomorrow?

835
00:50:37,988 --> 00:50:40,635
(ball clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

836
00:50:40,635 --> 00:50:42,300
- (laughs) How about that?

837
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,359
- [Tommy] Terrific play.

838
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:45,518
- What color's next?

839
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:47,413
- Any bloody color.

840
00:50:47,413 --> 00:50:48,580
- How about the blue?

841
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,893
- Ah, look.

842
00:50:55,432 --> 00:50:59,678
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

843
00:50:59,678 --> 00:51:02,836
- You're a real poker face, aren't you?

844
00:51:02,836 --> 00:51:04,474
- You reckon?

845
00:51:04,474 --> 00:51:08,249
(soft melodic music)

846
00:51:08,249 --> 00:51:10,590
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

847
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:11,469
- Seven.

848
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:14,064
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

849
00:51:14,064 --> 00:51:15,375
13.

850
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:17,440
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

851
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,736
14.

852
00:51:18,736 --> 00:51:20,407
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

853
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:21,240
19.

854
00:51:22,282 --> 00:51:23,476
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

855
00:51:23,476 --> 00:51:24,309
20.

856
00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:26,673
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

857
00:51:26,673 --> 00:51:27,506
27.

858
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,745
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

859
00:51:30,745 --> 00:51:32,011
28.

860
00:51:32,011 --> 00:51:33,633
(balls clicking)
(potted ball thudding)

861
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:34,466
32.

862
00:51:35,528 --> 00:51:38,184
(soft melodic music)

863
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:41,151
(balls clicking)

864
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:42,283
(potted ball thudding)

865
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:43,116
39.

866
00:51:45,003 --> 00:51:47,920
(balls clattering)

867
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,300
- I take it you concede the game?

868
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:57,774
- Like bloody hell, you conned us.

869
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:58,960
(blow thudding)
Uh!

870
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,133
- Hey, hey, come on, come on!

871
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:01,591
(all shouting)
Calm down, calm down.

872
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:05,351
Calm down, come on!
- That'll do, break it up.

873
00:52:05,351 --> 00:52:06,858
(man thudding into bar)

874
00:52:06,858 --> 00:52:09,203
(glass shattering)

875
00:52:09,203 --> 00:52:10,675
(man coughing)

876
00:52:10,675 --> 00:52:12,153
- You're a lucky fella.

877
00:52:13,461 --> 00:52:15,896
- Right, the rest of you
blokes can go home, go on.

878
00:52:15,896 --> 00:52:16,851
- Fair go, Sarge.
(all complaining)

879
00:52:16,851 --> 00:52:17,907
- Go on, move it!
- I haven't finished my beer.

880
00:52:17,907 --> 00:52:19,142
- Go on, get!

881
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:21,457
- [Man] Alright, alright,
no need to kick a man.

882
00:52:21,457 --> 00:52:23,239
- [Man] He's not a bloody dog.

883
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:24,293
- You two next.

884
00:52:24,293 --> 00:52:26,680
You blokes don't move,
till they're out of town.

885
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:27,897
Shift it, Donno.

886
00:52:33,729 --> 00:52:36,229
(dog barking)

887
00:52:38,014 --> 00:52:41,431
(snooker cue clattering)

888
00:52:43,917 --> 00:52:45,373
How much did they win?

889
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,545
- Two quid.

890
00:52:48,545 --> 00:52:50,283
- Hardly enough to shout about.

891
00:52:51,818 --> 00:52:53,410
Go on, give it to them.

892
00:53:00,374 --> 00:53:03,124
(notes rustling)

893
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:08,643
- Thanks, Sergeant, a beer?

894
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:13,323
Three beers, one for yourself.

895
00:53:17,168 --> 00:53:18,980
- I think you're trouble, Kearney.

896
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,713
- All we want is a fair go,
we've got this little place.

897
00:53:20,713 --> 00:53:24,783
- I've heard about the place
and I know who's there.

898
00:53:24,783 --> 00:53:27,250
What I want to know is how
you intend to live there?

899
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:28,950
- [Jack] If we could
get the work, we would.

900
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:31,110
- Times are tough around here.

901
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,047
The blokes out there want work,

902
00:53:32,047 --> 00:53:34,230
but the farmers are having a bad season,

903
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,470
there's no love lost
between them at the moment.

904
00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:37,490
It wouldn't take much to put
them at each other's throats,

905
00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:39,070
just don't let it be you two who do it

906
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:43,107
or I'll come down hard, so hard
you won't know what hit you.

907
00:53:50,963 --> 00:53:52,593
Thanks for the beer.

908
00:53:58,215 --> 00:53:59,048
Lohan,

909
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:00,963
no more.

910
00:54:04,906 --> 00:54:08,593
(men chattering)
- Good on you, mate.

911
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:10,670
- How much have we got left?

912
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:13,458
- Oh, three quid and a bit of silver.

913
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,958
- I'm gonna buy her a present.

914
00:54:19,427 --> 00:54:22,602
- What are you two up to?
(gate closing)

915
00:54:22,602 --> 00:54:25,352
(birds chirping)

916
00:54:28,538 --> 00:54:30,210
What have you got there?

917
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:32,430
- Oh, just something we picked up in town.

918
00:54:32,430 --> 00:54:33,380
- Let's set her up.

919
00:54:34,970 --> 00:54:37,720
(metal clanging)

920
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:40,053
- What is it?

921
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:45,870
A gramophone?

922
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,363
- [Tommy] You like it?

923
00:54:47,363 --> 00:54:48,390
- Does it work?

924
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:50,523
- Course, it's got batteries.

925
00:54:50,523 --> 00:54:52,340
(bag rustling)

926
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,707
Got a record too.

927
00:54:55,957 --> 00:54:57,920
Do you really like it?

928
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,306
- It's marvelous!
- That's good.

929
00:54:59,306 --> 00:55:00,810
- What Tommy's trying to say

930
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:03,037
is it's a present from us to you.

931
00:55:05,793 --> 00:55:06,626
- For me?

932
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:10,206
Thank you.

933
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:17,892
(soft melodic music)

934
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:25,617
- May I have the pleasure
of this dance, young lady?

935
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:30,217
(Tommy laughing)

936
00:55:30,217 --> 00:55:33,300
(soft melodic music)

937
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:42,083
(melodic orchestral music)

938
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,813
(Joycie laughing)

939
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:49,480
(Jack laughing)

940
00:56:02,879 --> 00:56:04,295
- Come on.

941
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:06,900
- Who, me? I can't dance.

942
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,000
- Oh, crikey, come on, we'll show him how.

943
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,220
(melodic orchestral music)

944
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:19,230
Just like Ginger Rogers.
(Joycie laughing)

945
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,710
Get your own, son.

946
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:25,677
(melodic orchestral music)

947
00:56:33,203 --> 00:56:36,036
(Joycie laughing)

948
00:56:38,221 --> 00:56:40,804
(all laughing)

949
00:56:45,863 --> 00:56:47,196
Mine's prettier.

950
00:56:56,438 --> 00:56:58,096
(both laughing)

951
00:56:58,096 --> 00:56:59,513
- Whoa, hey!
- Oh!

952
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,088
(vinyl record scratching)

953
00:57:02,088 --> 00:57:07,088
(wheels clattering)
(both laughing)

954
00:57:12,181 --> 00:57:15,098
(cicadas chirping)

955
00:57:16,246 --> 00:57:19,163
(women chattering)

956
00:57:22,424 --> 00:57:24,671
(car rumbling)

957
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:26,134
- Morning, ladies.

958
00:57:26,134 --> 00:57:28,036
- Good morning.
- Good morning, dear.

959
00:57:28,036 --> 00:57:30,444
(cricketers shouting)

960
00:57:30,444 --> 00:57:31,444
- [Man] LBW!

961
00:57:32,832 --> 00:57:34,667
(door opening)
(bell dinging)

962
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:35,784
- Good morning.

963
00:57:35,784 --> 00:57:36,880
- Morning.
(door closing)

964
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,167
It is, isn't it, lovely morning?

965
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:40,437
- You're the lass, who
was working for Mrs. Lohan

966
00:57:40,437 --> 00:57:41,802
up at the hotel, aren't you?

967
00:57:41,802 --> 00:57:43,787
- Well, I was, yeah.

968
00:57:43,787 --> 00:57:45,585
These are nice.

969
00:57:45,585 --> 00:57:48,045
- Oh, they're pure wool, very warm.

970
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:51,215
- I don't think I've got enough.

971
00:57:51,215 --> 00:57:54,213
I've got enough for a pair.
- Ah.

972
00:57:54,213 --> 00:57:57,627
- Though two wouldn't be
any use, I'd need three.

973
00:57:57,627 --> 00:57:59,110
- Oh, they're very warm,
two will be plenty.

974
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:01,851
- No, it'd have to be three.

975
00:58:01,851 --> 00:58:03,870
I was wondering if I paid for two now,

976
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:05,115
could you let me have
the other one, until-

977
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:07,790
- (laughs) Oh no, dear,
I'm sure you'll understand,

978
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,338
it's just, well, you are a stranger.

979
00:58:10,338 --> 00:58:11,700
- Yeah, I understand.

980
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,800
- I can put them away for you.

981
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,900
- No, I'll have to
think of something else.

982
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:17,733
- Oh well.

983
00:58:24,575 --> 00:58:27,562
(car rumbling quietly)

984
00:58:27,562 --> 00:58:30,523
(car horn tooting)

985
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,566
(traffic rumbling quietly)

986
00:58:32,566 --> 00:58:33,875
(cockerel crowing)

987
00:58:33,875 --> 00:58:35,340
(men wolf whistling)

988
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,826
- There you go, Charlie.
(men laughing)

989
00:58:38,826 --> 00:58:40,830
(cash register drawer closing)

990
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,664
- That was a quick change of heart.

991
00:58:42,664 --> 00:58:43,497
- Yeah.

992
00:58:44,805 --> 00:58:46,480
(bag rustling)

993
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,475
(background people chattering)

994
00:58:50,475 --> 00:58:54,510
Thank you.

995
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:56,221
(bell dinging)

996
00:58:56,221 --> 00:58:59,388
(cricketers shouting)

997
00:59:04,452 --> 00:59:07,486
(dog barking)

998
00:59:07,486 --> 00:59:12,486
(Mrs. Lohan humming)
(cheerful melodic music)

999
00:59:16,146 --> 00:59:18,220
- For God's sake, what is it?

1000
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:21,875
- A little present for the
sweetest girl in the world.

1001
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:25,010
I sent off to Sydney for it,
that's a real gold nugget

1002
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:29,010
and I thought later tonight maybe,

1003
00:59:29,010 --> 00:59:31,499
you might like to give
me a little present.

1004
00:59:31,499 --> 00:59:33,598
(face slapping)

1005
00:59:33,598 --> 00:59:35,181
- [Mrs. Lohan] God!

1006
00:59:40,259 --> 00:59:41,259
- Pure wool,

1007
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,588
they'll be warm as toast.

1008
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:49,240
- They're my present to you.
- They must've cost a fortune.

1009
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,073
- The lady at the store, Mrs. Gansman

1010
00:59:50,073 --> 00:59:52,013
let me have them cheap.

1011
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:53,711
- And why would she do that?

1012
00:59:53,711 --> 00:59:56,894
- [Joycie] Factory
seconds she called them.

1013
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:59,193
- Never underestimate
the power of a woman.

1014
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:01,994
- It was nice shopping
like the other women.

1015
01:00:01,994 --> 01:00:03,693
- You wouldn't want to do it
every day though, would you?

1016
01:00:03,693 --> 01:00:06,798
Be like being married.
- Dry up, Tommy.

1017
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:08,123
- What did I say?

1018
01:00:17,498 --> 01:00:18,521
(water running)

1019
01:00:18,521 --> 01:00:21,271
(water sloshing)

1020
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,702
- I think Tommy's shook on you.

1021
01:00:24,702 --> 01:00:26,292
- [Joycie] Is he?

1022
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:27,623
What about you, Jack?

1023
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:32,198
- Well, I'm a bit old for
that, bit past it, aren't I?

1024
01:00:32,198 --> 01:00:34,413
- [Joycie] Are you?

1025
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:35,863
- I'm twice your age.

1026
01:00:37,236 --> 01:00:39,360
- What's age got to do with it?

1027
01:00:42,358 --> 01:00:43,423
- I don't know.

1028
01:00:46,171 --> 01:00:48,921
(water sloshing)

1029
01:00:50,006 --> 01:00:54,088
- Can I tell you something
without hurting you?

1030
01:00:54,088 --> 01:00:56,846
- I suppose so.
(soft melodic music)

1031
01:00:56,846 --> 01:01:00,331
- I'm very fond of Tommy.

1032
01:01:00,331 --> 01:01:02,845
- I think it's more than that.

1033
01:01:02,845 --> 01:01:04,325
- Maybe it is,

1034
01:01:04,325 --> 01:01:06,675
but you can't accept that
I could love you too.

1035
01:01:08,349 --> 01:01:12,077
You're very wise, Jack and very stupid.

1036
01:01:13,977 --> 01:01:16,352
- I don't want anyone
feeling sorry for me.

1037
01:01:16,352 --> 01:01:17,185
- Stupid.

1038
01:01:18,522 --> 01:01:21,605
(soft melodic music)

1039
01:01:30,173 --> 01:01:32,923
(birds chirping)

1040
01:02:24,325 --> 01:02:25,987
- Got you, you bastard!
- Hey!

1041
01:02:25,987 --> 01:02:26,987
- Oh, blood!

1042
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:31,260
(flies buzzing)

1043
01:02:31,260 --> 01:02:34,710
- So help me, I found it
by the side of the road.

1044
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:37,490
A car must've driven over it.

1045
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:38,393
Dead it was.

1046
01:02:38,393 --> 01:02:41,990
- [Tommy] God, do you know
what they do to sheep stealers?

1047
01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:43,443
- Well, it's not yours.

1048
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:48,090
Half of it.
- What?

1049
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:50,813
- I'll give you a half of
it, if you shut up about it.

1050
01:02:52,219 --> 01:02:54,362
Didn't you, sneaking
around like a mad thing,

1051
01:02:54,362 --> 01:02:56,695
you'll scare a man to death.

1052
01:03:01,702 --> 01:03:03,950
- [Joycie] Jack, who's
gonna miss one sheep?

1053
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:05,664
There's millions of them.

1054
01:03:05,664 --> 01:03:07,833
- I might've known you'd stick up for him.

1055
01:03:08,723 --> 01:03:10,919
Just a free bit of tucker, isn't it?

1056
01:03:10,919 --> 01:03:12,950
It doesn't matter where
the hell it comes from,

1057
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:13,783
just like your blankets.
- What are you on about?

1058
01:03:13,783 --> 01:03:17,496
What about the bloody blankets?

1059
01:03:17,496 --> 01:03:21,118
- Tell him how you got
the blankets, Joycie.

1060
01:03:21,118 --> 01:03:23,880
- I bought them.
- I know you bought them.

1061
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,480
Tell him how you got the money,

1062
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,712
if you think I'm so bloody
innocent I don't know.

1063
01:03:26,712 --> 01:03:27,945
- What the hell are you on about?

1064
01:03:27,945 --> 01:03:29,093
What's he talking about?
- Forget it.

1065
01:03:29,093 --> 01:03:30,180
- No, I want to know
about the bloody blankets.

1066
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:32,950
- It doesn't matter.
- No, you tell him.

1067
01:03:34,973 --> 01:03:37,382
He's trying to tell you
that I whored for them.

1068
01:03:37,382 --> 01:03:38,215
- He what?

1069
01:03:38,215 --> 01:03:39,275
(blow thudding)
- Uh!

1070
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:40,748
(Jack thudding to ground)
- Did you?

1071
01:03:40,748 --> 01:03:43,967
- Well, what if I had?
I've done it before!

1072
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:46,560
- Alright, you say you didn't.

1073
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,393
We accept that.

1074
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:53,774
- You accept it? You don't
believe it, but you'll accept it?

1075
01:03:53,878 --> 01:03:55,615
- I didn't mean that.

1076
01:03:55,615 --> 01:03:59,735
- I'm leaving this place,
I'm getting out of here now.

1077
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:00,818
- [Tommy] Oh!

1078
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:06,367
(cockerel crowing)

1079
01:04:07,732 --> 01:04:12,732
(horse hooves clopping)
(buggy rattling)

1080
01:04:18,476 --> 01:04:20,900
- [Keith] G'day, how you doing?

1081
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:23,176
- Alright.
(Keith laughing)

1082
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:26,982
- Are you? I got a good price
for my load, good price.

1083
01:04:26,982 --> 01:04:30,437
Wouldn't mind celebrating,
if you know what I mean?

1084
01:04:30,437 --> 01:04:32,300
- I have to see Lohan
to fix up about my room.

1085
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,533
- [Keith] I'll come with you.

1086
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:37,033
- No, you wait here.

1087
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:39,660
I need five pounds.

1088
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:40,743
- Five quid?

1089
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,792
All right.

1090
01:04:44,792 --> 01:04:46,452
Alright.

1091
01:04:46,452 --> 01:04:49,202
(birds chirping)

1092
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,780
- Oh look, I don't know.

1093
01:05:03,264 --> 01:05:04,793
I gave it away sort of.

1094
01:05:05,627 --> 01:05:06,735
- You gave it away?

1095
01:05:06,735 --> 01:05:10,402
- Well, I bought it,
do what I like with it.

1096
01:05:12,274 --> 01:05:13,761
- Is Mrs. Lohan about?

1097
01:05:13,761 --> 01:05:16,150
- Oh, listen, you don't
want to make trouble for me.

1098
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,524
- [Joycie] I just want my room back.

1099
01:05:18,524 --> 01:05:21,095
- Well, we'll have to see about that.

1100
01:05:21,095 --> 01:05:25,850
- If you want your own room,
we'll build one for you.

1101
01:05:25,850 --> 01:05:28,392
We'd like you to come home.

1102
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:31,475
(soft melodic music)

1103
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:38,312
Please.

1104
01:05:50,628 --> 01:05:53,251
- Well, I'll be buggered.

1105
01:05:53,251 --> 01:05:55,834
(car rumbling)

1106
01:05:57,944 --> 01:05:59,283
- Just a moment.

1107
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:03,033
Here's your money back.

1108
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:07,939
- Hey, what's the matter, mate,

1109
01:06:07,939 --> 01:06:09,499
did he pinch your girlfriend?

1110
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:14,459
- Girlfriend? She's a
prostitute, a bloody tart.

1111
01:06:14,459 --> 01:06:15,425
(men laughing)

1112
01:06:15,425 --> 01:06:17,962
- [Man] Few of those around
here, I can tell you.

1113
01:06:17,962 --> 01:06:21,386
- [Man] What are you talking
about, you can't afford it.

1114
01:06:21,386 --> 01:06:24,969
(traffic rumbling quietly)

1115
01:06:30,107 --> 01:06:34,285
- I heard him distinctly, the
woman's a common prostitute.

1116
01:06:34,285 --> 01:06:35,688
- I don't know about common,

1117
01:06:35,688 --> 01:06:36,773
not too many of them around here.

1118
01:06:36,773 --> 01:06:39,155
- [Annie] I don't think it's funny, Keith.

1119
01:06:39,155 --> 01:06:40,679
- Look, she probably is.

1120
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:42,809
As long as there's no
trouble, what's it matter?

1121
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:44,335
- Matter?

1122
01:06:44,335 --> 01:06:46,696
- Could be a good thing in a way,

1123
01:06:46,696 --> 01:06:50,225
keep the hot-blooded blokes
away from the decent girls.

1124
01:06:50,225 --> 01:06:51,613
- That is disgusting.

1125
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,653
- And the scribes and the Pharisees

1126
01:07:02,653 --> 01:07:05,714
bring unto him a woman taken in adultery

1127
01:07:05,714 --> 01:07:09,647
and they set her in the
midst and said to him,

1128
01:07:09,647 --> 01:07:14,240
"Master, this woman was
even now taken in adultery.

1129
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:19,070
Now Moses in the law commanded
us to stone such a one,

1130
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:21,099
but what sayest thou?"

1131
01:07:21,099 --> 01:07:22,870
And this, they said tempting him,

1132
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:25,200
that they might accuse him,

1133
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:28,233
but Jesus bowing himself down

1134
01:07:28,233 --> 01:07:30,390
wrote with his finger on the ground

1135
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:33,960
and when therefore they
continued asking him,

1136
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,257
he lifted himself up and said to them,

1137
01:07:37,257 --> 01:07:39,770
"He that is without sin among you,

1138
01:07:39,770 --> 01:07:42,487
let him first cast a stone at her."

1139
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:48,074
(traffic rumbling quietly)

1140
01:07:50,195 --> 01:07:53,612
(cheerful melodic music)

1141
01:08:00,615 --> 01:08:02,441
(blanket flapping)

1142
01:08:02,441 --> 01:08:04,610
(birds chirping)

1143
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:06,923
- We're going into town.

1144
01:08:06,923 --> 01:08:08,673
- Yeah, we talked about it yesterday.

1145
01:08:08,673 --> 01:08:09,537
- Yeah, we're gonna get some work.

1146
01:08:09,537 --> 01:08:11,940
- Well, where, for God's
sake? There isn't any.

1147
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:13,123
- Maybe that's why we're gonna try.

1148
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:14,741
- Well, they can't blame us for looking.

1149
01:08:14,741 --> 01:08:15,574
- Well, wait for me, I'm coming too.

1150
01:08:18,462 --> 01:08:19,852
(gentle melodic music)

1151
01:08:19,852 --> 01:08:21,352
- What's the time?

1152
01:08:29,842 --> 01:08:33,259
(cheerful melodic music)

1153
01:08:36,548 --> 01:08:39,507
(traffic rumbling quietly)

1154
01:08:39,507 --> 01:08:41,279
(background people chattering)

1155
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,862
- [Man] Give us a cuddle, love.

1156
01:08:46,926 --> 01:08:48,385
- Well?

1157
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:50,712
- Better try Lohan, gotta start somewhere.

1158
01:08:50,712 --> 01:08:51,903
- I'll try the shop.

1159
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:56,967
(dog barking)

1160
01:09:01,173 --> 01:09:03,264
- Get that thing out of it, it's crawling.

1161
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,620
- I wanna know what
you're gonna do about it.

1162
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:09,563
- Burn the bloody thing, if
you don't get it out of here.

1163
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:16,283
- I found it shoved under
a rock near the shack.

1164
01:09:16,283 --> 01:09:18,359
It has to be them.
- Could've been anyone.

1165
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:20,374
How do you know who put it there?

1166
01:09:20,374 --> 01:09:21,860
- Well, those two no-hopers at the shack.

1167
01:09:25,335 --> 01:09:26,713
- [Keith] Or those two.

1168
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:30,613
- Sorry.

1169
01:09:31,497 --> 01:09:33,342
- Or if you knew of something?

1170
01:09:33,342 --> 01:09:35,173
- There's no work anywhere.

1171
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:38,420
- It needn't be in town,
I've done some kitchen work.

1172
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,410
- We know what you've done.

1173
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:42,413
There's no work for the likes of you.

1174
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:48,881
- I see.

1175
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:50,560
Thank you.

1176
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,840
- I'm sorry.

1177
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:52,673
- Trollop.

1178
01:09:55,158 --> 01:09:57,770
- One of my lambs,
slaughtered it for meat.

1179
01:09:57,770 --> 01:09:59,708
- Oh, come off it, mate.

1180
01:09:59,708 --> 01:10:02,000
- Mr. Carter here reckons
he found the skin of a lamb-

1181
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,470
- Reckons nothing, I found it.

1182
01:10:03,470 --> 01:10:05,138
- You can't blame us for
your own stock losses!

1183
01:10:05,138 --> 01:10:06,920
- You shut up too, you'll
get your chances later.

1184
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,753
- Will we?

1185
01:10:09,021 --> 01:10:12,243
- Well, Crow, what are
you gonna do about it?

1186
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:16,927
- Taking them down the
station for questioning.

1187
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:17,760
(men complaining)

1188
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,138
Well, what do you blokes
want me to do, hang them?

1189
01:10:20,138 --> 01:10:22,520
- Good idea!
(all grumbling)

1190
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,158
(children singing in distance)

1191
01:10:25,158 --> 01:10:28,619
(background people chattering)

1192
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:31,273
- [Man] Lock them up
and throw away the key.

1193
01:10:31,273 --> 01:10:33,333
- [Man] Fair go, what did they do, Sarge?

1194
01:10:33,333 --> 01:10:35,426
- [Man] Yeah, good for them there, mate,

1195
01:10:35,426 --> 01:10:36,540
eat the cockroaches.

1196
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:39,165
Yeah, look like bread
and water for you blokes.

1197
01:10:39,165 --> 01:10:41,915
- What are you galahs looking at?

1198
01:10:44,168 --> 01:10:46,668
(dog barking)

1199
01:10:51,003 --> 01:10:52,613
- This bloke just gave you half a lamb

1200
01:10:52,613 --> 01:10:54,234
out of the goodness of his heart?

1201
01:10:54,234 --> 01:10:56,390
- Well, country people
are supposed to be famous

1202
01:10:56,390 --> 01:10:58,845
for their hospitality, could've been his.

1203
01:10:58,845 --> 01:11:00,560
- Well, let's just say I'm offering you

1204
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:02,402
that famous country hospitality.

1205
01:11:02,402 --> 01:11:04,073
- You're locking us up?

1206
01:11:04,073 --> 01:11:06,523
- You know, I'm good and mine.

1207
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:08,661
If I let you out of here,

1208
01:11:08,661 --> 01:11:10,100
I wouldn't be responsible for your safety.

1209
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:11,552
- We'll worry about that.

1210
01:11:11,552 --> 01:11:13,910
- There's also the matter of my job.

1211
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,473
I like it here, it's a good, little town,

1212
01:11:15,473 --> 01:11:18,450
as long as you don't upset the farmers.

1213
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:19,773
- You weak sod.

1214
01:11:21,832 --> 01:11:25,003
- Well, you'll find out
how weak I am, come on.

1215
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:28,848
(keys jangling)

1216
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,958
(children playing)

1217
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,740
(kick thudding)

1218
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:41,413
- Congratulations, Tommy,

1219
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:45,720
those few kind words improved
his humor quite a lot.

1220
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:46,553
- Stuff him!

1221
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:01,740
- You can't keep them here.

1222
01:12:01,740 --> 01:12:05,293
- Girly, in this town, I can
do just about what I like.

1223
01:12:07,377 --> 01:12:09,008
- So you could let them go?

1224
01:12:09,008 --> 01:12:09,841
- I could.

1225
01:12:23,654 --> 01:12:25,790
- Maybe I could talk you into it?

1226
01:12:32,707 --> 01:12:35,624
(lighter clicking)

1227
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:38,574
(door opening)

1228
01:12:38,574 --> 01:12:41,257
- Sudden change of heart, isn't it?

1229
01:12:41,257 --> 01:12:42,453
- Don't push your luck.

1230
01:12:44,380 --> 01:12:46,360
Just be grateful.
(gate clanging)

1231
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:47,483
- We're grateful.

1232
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,137
- Oi.
(gate closing)

1233
01:12:53,137 --> 01:12:55,430
You're better off knowing,
so you leave town.

1234
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:57,283
- Yeah, better for who?
- Everyone.

1235
01:12:58,454 --> 01:13:00,328
I'm telling you, you got two choices.

1236
01:13:00,328 --> 01:13:02,780
You can get out of town, I
won't be sorry to see you go.

1237
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:04,704
You can stick close to
that shack of yours,

1238
01:13:04,704 --> 01:13:08,827
wait for the magistrate to come around.

1239
01:13:16,211 --> 01:13:18,798
- The sexual act is a
beautiful and a pleasant thing,

1240
01:13:18,798 --> 01:13:20,933
Mrs. Crow, designed by God to ensure

1241
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:23,483
the continuation of the human race.

1242
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:27,430
This repugnance you feel
towards your husband

1243
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:28,660
is contrary to God's great plan.

1244
01:13:28,660 --> 01:13:32,390
Now you must give yourself
freely and in love,

1245
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,100
oh, never in lust,

1246
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:37,490
but in the knowledge that
even this can be a sacrifice

1247
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:39,713
and a highly acceptable sacrifice too.

1248
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,043
- I'll try, Father, I'll try.

1249
01:13:48,616 --> 01:13:49,900
If you only knew.

1250
01:13:52,685 --> 01:13:53,993
- Please, Mrs. Crow, please.

1251
01:13:58,559 --> 01:13:59,863
Go in peace, my child.

1252
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,120
- You'd best go out the back way.

1253
01:14:16,120 --> 01:14:18,949
They're likely to see me around town.

1254
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:20,340
- Don't worry.

1255
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:21,513
- Here, hang on.

1256
01:14:23,296 --> 01:14:24,463
Give you some.

1257
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:27,710
- I got what I bargained for.

1258
01:14:27,710 --> 01:14:31,517
- I know, I just want
to do the right thing.

1259
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:39,193
(door opening)

1260
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:42,446
(door closing)

1261
01:14:42,446 --> 01:14:45,388
(soft melodic music)

1262
01:14:45,388 --> 01:14:47,405
(traffic rumbling quietly)

1263
01:14:47,405 --> 01:14:50,155
(horse neighing)

1264
01:14:51,398 --> 01:14:54,471
(door unlocking)

1265
01:14:54,471 --> 01:14:57,054
(door closing)

1266
01:14:57,986 --> 01:15:01,069
(soft melodic music)

1267
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:08,493
- Keith.

1268
01:15:11,512 --> 01:15:12,345
Keith,

1269
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:14,370
it's me, I'm home.

1270
01:15:23,167 --> 01:15:25,043
You can make love.

1271
01:15:27,032 --> 01:15:28,449
- Not now, honey.

1272
01:15:29,366 --> 01:15:31,523
- It's all right.

1273
01:15:31,523 --> 01:15:32,710
I want to.

1274
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:35,056
- Not now, I've had a
hard day, go to sleep.

1275
01:15:35,056 --> 01:15:38,372
- I want to, I want to, Keith, now.

1276
01:15:38,372 --> 01:15:40,010
- Annie, what's the matter?

1277
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:42,017
You're behaving like a tart.

1278
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:44,887
(Annie gasping)
Leave me alone.

1279
01:15:44,887 --> 01:15:46,147
I'm sorry, love, I didn't mean that.

1280
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:47,843
- Don't touch me.

1281
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,093
Don't touch me.

1282
01:15:50,841 --> 01:15:52,482
All these years.
- Annie.

1283
01:15:52,482 --> 01:15:57,399
- Having you touching me,
putting up with, once, just once.

1284
01:16:11,493 --> 01:16:14,243
(birds chirping)

1285
01:16:19,543 --> 01:16:20,929
(hammer tapping)

1286
01:16:20,929 --> 01:16:22,012
(dust blowing)

1287
01:16:22,012 --> 01:16:24,845
(hammer thudding)

1288
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:28,450
(hand patting)

1289
01:16:28,450 --> 01:16:29,283
- Let me help.

1290
01:16:29,283 --> 01:16:30,840
- You've helped enough already.

1291
01:16:30,840 --> 01:16:34,787
- Fair go, mate, she did it
to get us out and you know it.

1292
01:16:34,787 --> 01:16:36,623
- What's gonna keep us out?

1293
01:16:39,590 --> 01:16:41,460
Unless of course you've
got a regular arrangement

1294
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:42,986
with a copper.

1295
01:16:42,986 --> 01:16:45,119
- I'll say this for Crow,

1296
01:16:45,119 --> 01:16:48,114
he might be a copper, but he's honest,

1297
01:16:48,114 --> 01:16:50,543
which is more than I
can say for some people.

1298
01:16:51,427 --> 01:16:53,762
He took what he wanted and he paid for it

1299
01:16:53,762 --> 01:16:56,280
and at least he had the
grace to be ashamed.

1300
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,113
- Did you?

1301
01:17:03,973 --> 01:17:05,323
(pot clattering)
- Where are you going?

1302
01:17:05,323 --> 01:17:07,636
- [Tommy] I'm going to
sort the bastard out!

1303
01:17:07,636 --> 01:17:08,469
- Crow?

1304
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:11,084
- Crow.

1305
01:17:18,036 --> 01:17:21,453
(gate clanging)
Piss off!

1306
01:17:31,582 --> 01:17:33,926
- Shouldn't the police move her on?

1307
01:17:33,926 --> 01:17:37,267
I mean, your husband-
- My husband is very busy.

1308
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:41,460
If you don't want to come,
any of you, just say so now.

1309
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,340
- She's got two men with her,
we can't make them go away.

1310
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,153
- We can talk to her as a
delegation, convince her to leave.

1311
01:17:48,153 --> 01:17:49,823
- And that's all we do?

1312
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,208
Look, what if she refuses?

1313
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:55,560
- We'll cross that bridge,
when we come to it.

1314
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,175
I think it's time we got moving.

1315
01:17:57,175 --> 01:17:59,740
- Alright then, if you think so.

1316
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:00,573
- Yes.

1317
01:18:01,898 --> 01:18:04,943
- Are you serious about this?
- I've had a gut full.

1318
01:18:04,943 --> 01:18:06,160
- She's a good girl, Tommy.

1319
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,585
- I know.

1320
01:18:07,585 --> 01:18:09,035
Kearney.
- Yeah?

1321
01:18:09,035 --> 01:18:11,093
- Sometimes I wish we weren't mates.

1322
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:15,208
(car rumbling quietly)

1323
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:20,113
(soft melodic music)

1324
01:18:23,485 --> 01:18:27,311
(women speaking quietly)

1325
01:18:27,311 --> 01:18:30,061
(birds chirping)

1326
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,469
(women speaking quietly)

1327
01:18:41,469 --> 01:18:44,552
(soft melodic music)

1328
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:55,463
- [Joycie] Can I help you ladies?

1329
01:18:56,820 --> 01:19:00,463
- Yes, you can, you can leave our town.

1330
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,400
We don't want prostitutes here.

1331
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,377
You live here with two men

1332
01:19:06,377 --> 01:19:08,430
and you give yourself to both of them.

1333
01:19:08,430 --> 01:19:10,423
- Who do you think you're talking to?

1334
01:19:11,588 --> 01:19:14,771
Get out of here, all of
you, this is my home!

1335
01:19:14,771 --> 01:19:15,853
Leave that alone!

1336
01:19:15,853 --> 01:19:18,010
- [Annie] In the dirt, where they belong.

1337
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:18,843
- Stop it!
- Oh!

1338
01:19:18,843 --> 01:19:20,430
(Annie thudding to ground)
- Annie, you'll hurt yourself.

1339
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,540
- Why don't you let your
husband drive me out, Mrs. Crow?

1340
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,403
He's the law around here.

1341
01:19:24,403 --> 01:19:25,236
- Argh!
(rock thudding)

1342
01:19:25,236 --> 01:19:26,855
- Argh!
(women exclaiming)

1343
01:19:26,855 --> 01:19:31,230
- Annie, stop it, Annie.
(all speaking at once)

1344
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:33,870
- These things can go too!
(plates smashing)

1345
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,040
(objects clattering)
- Get out of here, get out!

1346
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:37,941
(both shouting)
You can't do this!

1347
01:19:37,941 --> 01:19:40,688
(bottle shattering)

1348
01:19:40,688 --> 01:19:43,412
(women shouting chaotically)
- Annie!

1349
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:45,332
- What are you doing?
- Argh!

1350
01:19:45,332 --> 01:19:49,698
(women shouting chaotically)
(fire roaring)

1351
01:19:49,698 --> 01:19:51,840
(women shouting chaotically)
- Get her away from here!

1352
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,507
Get her away, Annie!

1353
01:19:55,448 --> 01:19:56,288
Annie!

1354
01:19:56,288 --> 01:19:58,871
(fire roaring)

1355
01:19:59,963 --> 01:20:02,173
(water sloshing)
- Uh, uh!

1356
01:20:02,173 --> 01:20:05,454
(pot clattering to floor)

1357
01:20:05,454 --> 01:20:07,228
(women shouting chaotically)
(fire roaring)

1358
01:20:07,228 --> 01:20:11,061
- Don't let her loose.
- Come on, get her away.

1359
01:20:12,976 --> 01:20:14,728
(fire roaring)
- Uh!

1360
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:17,243
(women shouting chaotically)
- For God's sake, Annie!

1361
01:20:17,243 --> 01:20:19,936
(Joycie coughing)

1362
01:20:19,936 --> 01:20:21,103
- [Joycie] Uh!

1363
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:25,226
- Never enough!
(women shouting chaotically)

1364
01:20:25,226 --> 01:20:26,059
- Uh, uh!

1365
01:20:26,942 --> 01:20:29,876
- Come away, come away!
- Come on, turn away.

1366
01:20:29,876 --> 01:20:32,124
- Burn in the fire!

1367
01:20:32,124 --> 01:20:34,144
(beam thudding to ground)
(Joycie screaming)

1368
01:20:34,144 --> 01:20:36,860
(fire roaring)

1369
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,583
- Joycie, Joycie, it's too late, Joycie!

1370
01:20:39,583 --> 01:20:41,254
(Joycie breathing heavily)
(glass shattering)

1371
01:20:41,254 --> 01:20:44,421
(fire roaring loudly)

1372
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:50,173
(glass shattering)

1373
01:20:58,306 --> 01:20:59,723
We never dreamed.

1374
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,188
- It's nothing.

1375
01:21:02,188 --> 01:21:03,893
It's all gone.

1376
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:07,916
- [Mrs. Gansman] Get away,
dear, it's for your own good.

1377
01:21:07,916 --> 01:21:09,333
- Leave me alone.

1378
01:21:17,461 --> 01:21:19,128
- Hey, you, Kearney.

1379
01:21:20,157 --> 01:21:22,717
- Look Evans, we're not after trouble.

1380
01:21:22,717 --> 01:21:24,027
We're looking for Crow.

1381
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:25,693
- You're going the wrong way.

1382
01:21:26,559 --> 01:21:27,803
He's in the pub.

1383
01:21:29,369 --> 01:21:31,237
(car rumbling)

1384
01:21:31,237 --> 01:21:36,237
(soft melodic music)
(fire roaring)

1385
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,358
(wood clattering)

1386
01:21:43,127 --> 01:21:45,024
(wood clattering)

1387
01:21:45,024 --> 01:21:47,774
(Joycie sobbing)

1388
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:51,472
(wood clattering)

1389
01:21:52,495 --> 01:21:55,578
(soft melodic music)

1390
01:22:03,009 --> 01:22:05,842
(wood clattering)

1391
01:22:07,433 --> 01:22:10,516
(soft melodic music)

1392
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:19,650
- It was your lamb they
stole, do you wanna start?

1393
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:21,114
- Yeah.

1394
01:22:21,114 --> 01:22:22,586
I'll take the old one.
(Jack scoffing)

1395
01:22:22,586 --> 01:22:24,010
- I thought you might.

1396
01:22:24,010 --> 01:22:25,049
- I'm warning you,

1397
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:27,658
any fighting and whoever's
involved is barred.

1398
01:22:27,658 --> 01:22:29,320
- You'll have to bar every drinker

1399
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,560
you've got in the pub, Lohan.

1400
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:33,282
- Right.
(radio broadcasting quietly)

1401
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,632
- Well, let's have a
drink before we're barred.

1402
01:22:36,478 --> 01:22:37,750
Set them up, Mr. Lohan.

1403
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:41,054
- You're not gonna talk
your way out of this one.

1404
01:22:41,054 --> 01:22:43,102
- I say we beat the hell out of them.

1405
01:22:43,102 --> 01:22:45,355
- I know, but there's
no need to rush into it.

1406
01:22:45,355 --> 01:22:46,678
- Well, let's get it over.

1407
01:22:46,678 --> 01:22:49,161
- Come on.
(men scuffling)

1408
01:22:49,161 --> 01:22:51,277
(man thudding to floor)
- Hey, you're barred!

1409
01:22:51,277 --> 01:22:54,056
You're barred, you're all barred!

1410
01:22:54,056 --> 01:22:56,713
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

1411
01:22:56,713 --> 01:22:57,675
- Whoa!
(man thudding to floor)

1412
01:22:57,675 --> 01:22:58,677
(glass shattering)

1413
01:22:58,677 --> 01:23:00,104
(blow thudding)
- Uh!

1414
01:23:00,104 --> 01:23:04,568
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

1415
01:23:04,568 --> 01:23:05,826
(glass shattering)
- Uh!

1416
01:23:05,826 --> 01:23:08,209
- Get out, you're all barred!

1417
01:23:08,209 --> 01:23:10,070
(blow thudding)
Argh!

1418
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:15,070
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

1419
01:23:18,104 --> 01:23:19,586
- Having a bit of trouble, mate?

1420
01:23:19,586 --> 01:23:21,575
- You keep your nose out of this, sport.

1421
01:23:21,575 --> 01:23:22,632
(blow thudding)
- Uh!

1422
01:23:22,632 --> 01:23:23,590
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

1423
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:24,903
- Hey, who's who?
- Theirs!

1424
01:23:24,903 --> 01:23:26,548
- Come on, fellas!

1425
01:23:26,548 --> 01:23:31,548
(blows thudding)
(men shouting)

1426
01:23:36,954 --> 01:23:38,160
- Bastard!

1427
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,062
(chair thudding)
- Uh!

1428
01:23:41,062 --> 01:23:43,698
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

1429
01:23:43,698 --> 01:23:45,829
- Tommy, here, come on!

1430
01:23:45,829 --> 01:23:50,829
(blows thudding)
(men grunting)

1431
01:23:52,362 --> 01:23:54,815
Well, they all seem to
be introduced to each.

1432
01:23:54,815 --> 01:23:55,978
- Yeah, let's go.

1433
01:23:55,978 --> 01:23:56,895
- Hey, you!

1434
01:23:57,871 --> 01:23:59,485
(blow thudding)
Uh!

1435
01:23:59,485 --> 01:24:02,513
(radio sports commentator shouting)

1436
01:24:02,513 --> 01:24:05,263
(birds chirping)

1437
01:24:17,109 --> 01:24:19,024
(metal clattering)

1438
01:24:19,024 --> 01:24:22,480
- A man ought to go back and
thump the bloody lot of them.

1439
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:23,817
- Well, that did us.

1440
01:24:26,077 --> 01:24:27,063
No, it's finished.

1441
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:29,260
We'll move on.

1442
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:30,831
- And where are we gonna go?

1443
01:24:30,831 --> 01:24:32,070
Do you think they're gonna treat us

1444
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:33,520
any different somewhere else?

1445
01:24:34,424 --> 01:24:35,698
- No.

1446
01:24:35,698 --> 01:24:37,493
It's because of me.

1447
01:24:37,493 --> 01:24:40,193
- No, it's not you, it's us,
the three of us together.

1448
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:44,250
They just can't take that.

1449
01:24:46,663 --> 01:24:49,145
They live in their
crummy, little community,

1450
01:24:49,145 --> 01:24:50,963
where everyone knows everyone.

1451
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:55,440
They all toe the line, till
they get behind their own doors

1452
01:24:58,125 --> 01:25:01,387
and they can't take it,
because of what we've got,

1453
01:25:04,090 --> 01:25:04,923
had.

1454
01:25:04,923 --> 01:25:06,632
- What we had?

1455
01:25:06,632 --> 01:25:07,910
For God's sake, what do we have?

1456
01:25:07,910 --> 01:25:09,990
A bloody, ramshackle hut
and half a day's tucker.

1457
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:11,390
- Is that all we had, Tommy?

1458
01:25:13,232 --> 01:25:15,140
- We'll have to split up.

1459
01:25:15,140 --> 01:25:15,973
- Us?

1460
01:25:17,340 --> 01:25:19,669
- No, Jack doesn't mean that, he means me.

1461
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:21,003
I can't come with you.

1462
01:25:22,162 --> 01:25:24,020
- I'm not gonna leave you here.

1463
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:25,810
They're not gonna change overnight,

1464
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:27,480
they'll treat you like-
- Will they?

1465
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:29,117
I know enough about them
and their precious cop,

1466
01:25:29,117 --> 01:25:31,123
that'd shut most of them up for life.

1467
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:34,519
But you're lucky, I
saved a bit of your gear.

1468
01:25:34,519 --> 01:25:36,436
You'd better get going.

1469
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:44,153
(soft melodic music)

1470
01:25:45,870 --> 01:25:47,789
- Well, we'll be off.

1471
01:25:47,789 --> 01:25:48,622
- Alright.

1472
01:25:49,671 --> 01:25:51,167
- We'll see you.

1473
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:55,993
- Yeah.

1474
01:26:04,587 --> 01:26:06,043
- Meet you down the road.

1475
01:26:11,217 --> 01:26:12,634
- Goodbye, Tommy.

1476
01:26:13,739 --> 01:26:16,163
(soft melodic music)

1477
01:26:16,163 --> 01:26:19,470
(birds chirping)

1478
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:22,553
(soft melodic music)

1479
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:44,330
- I hope you're bloody satisfied.

1480
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:46,540
You buggered things up
this time, didn't you?

1481
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,355
Well, I could cheerfully
flatten you, mate.

1482
01:26:48,355 --> 01:26:49,610
- I wouldn't try to fight you,

1483
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:51,309
I might let you get away with it.

1484
01:26:51,309 --> 01:26:52,142
- Yeah, right?

1485
01:26:52,142 --> 01:26:54,660
Well, chuck your swag down
and let's settle it now.

1486
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:55,783
- I wouldn't need to put it down.

1487
01:26:55,783 --> 01:26:56,763
- Put it down, bugger you!

1488
01:26:56,763 --> 01:26:58,813
- Don't try it, Kearney, you'll be sorry.

1489
01:27:03,478 --> 01:27:06,228
(birds chirping)

1490
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,800
- Right then, there's a turn off up ahead.

1491
01:27:14,081 --> 01:27:16,380
But I want to say something.

1492
01:27:17,753 --> 01:27:21,714
She was the only beautiful
thing that ever happened to me.

1493
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:23,653
Doesn't matter what she was.

1494
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:27,523
To me, she was pure.

1495
01:27:29,385 --> 01:27:31,183
I suppose that means I love her.

1496
01:27:32,256 --> 01:27:33,089
- I know.

1497
01:27:43,419 --> 01:27:44,283
- Right then.

1498
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:47,053
I'll see you.

1499
01:27:49,070 --> 01:27:50,340
- Yeah, good luck.

1500
01:27:59,161 --> 01:28:01,911
(birds chirping)

1501
01:28:17,446 --> 01:28:20,196
(men chattering)

1502
01:28:23,379 --> 01:28:25,977
- Oi, truck will take
you as far as Wolumla,

1503
01:28:25,977 --> 01:28:28,240
you've work there with a
bloke by the name of Johnson,

1504
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:30,101
God help him.
(men cheering)

1505
01:28:30,101 --> 01:28:31,883
I don't know when I'll
see you back here now.

1506
01:28:31,883 --> 01:28:34,552
- What do you want with these, Sarge?

1507
01:28:34,552 --> 01:28:37,135
(men cheering)

1508
01:28:40,891 --> 01:28:42,491
(truck rumbling)
(man thudding to floor)

1509
01:28:42,491 --> 01:28:43,760
(dog barking)

1510
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,484
(men shouting)

1511
01:28:45,484 --> 01:28:48,854
(footsteps running)

1512
01:28:48,854 --> 01:28:50,732
Who's paying for the beer, Sarge?

1513
01:28:50,732 --> 01:28:52,442
- You mean they didn't?

1514
01:28:52,442 --> 01:28:55,831
Jeez, you're getting slack, Lohan.

1515
01:28:55,831 --> 01:29:00,469
(truck rumbling)
(men laughing)

1516
01:29:00,469 --> 01:29:03,219
(birds chirping)

1517
01:29:15,544 --> 01:29:18,544
(footsteps running)

1518
01:29:24,842 --> 01:29:26,210
- Jack, what are you-

1519
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:27,998
- I know I'm a lot older than you.

1520
01:29:27,998 --> 01:29:30,745
I won't ask anything
from you, I'll get a job,

1521
01:29:30,745 --> 01:29:33,530
we can settle down and
get married, if you like.

1522
01:29:33,530 --> 01:29:36,213
- You miserable, old bugger!

1523
01:29:36,213 --> 01:29:37,046
(pot thudding to ground)
You're too late, mate,

1524
01:29:37,046 --> 01:29:39,690
I've told Joycie I'm
gonna marry her already.

1525
01:29:39,690 --> 01:29:42,109
- Bloody fine mate you turned
out, a man's back's turned-

1526
01:29:42,109 --> 01:29:43,830
- What about yours, after running away

1527
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:45,888
puffing and bloody wheezing
your old man's limp!

1528
01:29:45,888 --> 01:29:47,570
- I'll give you old man!
- Stop it!

1529
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:48,403
Stop it!

1530
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:52,178
I'm not marrying you, Jack.
- Yeah.

1531
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,300
- Or you!

1532
01:29:53,300 --> 01:29:54,543
I'm not marrying anyone.

1533
01:29:55,820 --> 01:29:56,653
I tried to explain it to you,

1534
01:29:56,653 --> 01:29:59,133
but you're both too stupid to understand!

1535
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:03,640
So thanks for the offers, but I'm leaving

1536
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:08,473
by myself the way I came
and you're going together.

1537
01:30:10,122 --> 01:30:13,205
(soft melodic music)

1538
01:30:33,437 --> 01:30:35,245
(Tommy thudding to the ground)
- Uh!

1539
01:30:35,245 --> 01:30:37,610
- Look, now give us a go.

1540
01:30:37,610 --> 01:30:38,869
We're all in the same boat,

1541
01:30:38,869 --> 01:30:40,580
we can never go back to the way we were,

1542
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:42,560
but, oh look, we've shared winnings,

1543
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,940
we depend on each other,

1544
01:30:43,940 --> 01:30:46,079
we've, we've done things for each other.

1545
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:47,481
Joycie.

1546
01:30:47,481 --> 01:30:50,564
(soft melodic music)

1547
01:30:55,260 --> 01:30:56,918
Look, it's the way it's got to be.

1548
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:59,203
I mean, it's up to the both of
us to give you what you need.

1549
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,990
- I don't need anything.

1550
01:31:00,990 --> 01:31:02,190
- You've admitted it to yourself,

1551
01:31:02,190 --> 01:31:03,160
that between the two of us,

1552
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,180
we practically add up to one decent man,

1553
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,780
well, that's the man that needs you.

1554
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:08,980
- I, Jack does, same.

1555
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:12,270
- There's no way I'm gonna
go tramping through the Bush

1556
01:31:12,270 --> 01:31:14,850
for the rest of my life with
a toothbrush and a blanket

1557
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:15,780
and you said yourself,

1558
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:17,230
no one's gonna let us settle anywhere.

1559
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:18,820
- I've been thinking about that too.

1560
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:20,590
- Oh, yeah?
- You can depend on Jack.

1561
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:22,250
- I've always been keen on getting

1562
01:31:22,250 --> 01:31:24,113
a little carnival act together,
you know, like a sideshow.

1563
01:31:24,113 --> 01:31:24,990
- You what?

1564
01:31:24,990 --> 01:31:27,020
- Yes, it's great, you know,
the people you meet them,

1565
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:29,549
they're open minded, they,
they mind their own business.

1566
01:31:29,549 --> 01:31:30,933
It's a good, clean life,
you see the country

1567
01:31:30,933 --> 01:31:32,723
and you've got some security.

1568
01:31:32,723 --> 01:31:34,743
- Hey, listen, I've been trying
to tell you that for years.

1569
01:31:34,743 --> 01:31:35,711
- Look, skip it-
- I don't know

1570
01:31:35,711 --> 01:31:36,871
anything about carnivals.
- You can't go wrong,

1571
01:31:36,871 --> 01:31:38,275
if you do what I tell you.

1572
01:31:38,275 --> 01:31:42,442
Now listen, you want a big
drum, boom, boom, boom.

1573
01:31:47,479 --> 01:31:50,289
(crowd shouting encouragement)
(bell dinging)

1574
01:31:50,289 --> 01:31:55,289
(blows thudding)
(crowd shouting encouragement)

1575
01:32:04,507 --> 01:32:06,479
(blow thudding)
(Tommy thudding to floor)

1576
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,153
- Look, I'll double it,
do you want to double it?

1577
01:32:09,153 --> 01:32:12,113
- I'm not sure, my boyfriend's
