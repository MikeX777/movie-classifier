1
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:15,230
"Pancha Pandabas in history
5 brothers here with honey bee"

2
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:28,880
"Wow! Bharathanatyam, Kuchipudi
Manipuri, Kaththakali, dances many"

3
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:38,429
"In Mahabharatha dance, drama, all round
Even Brahma's pen will halt spell bound"

4
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:56,180
"In this game of dice a coin in each square
Chance can give joy or sorrow, bewarel!"

5
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:15,410
"Siblings 5 and bee like flowers scented
Smiling, con, connive enchanted"

6
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:42,619
"5 brothers with honey bee"

7
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:58,250
Shall we go the main song...okay?

8
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:12,099
"Praise bo the Vishnu's glory
Supreme God Lord Hari"

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
"This world is on a hurry-burry spree
By playing cards, love bloomed secretly"

10
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:10,469
"History will be retold through this story
From start to finish, don't you worry!"

11
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,010
"Even the battle of Kurukshetra will be shown
like the floral garden of krishna's Brindavan"

12
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:20,350
"With their magic wand you"ll see
they will present us a perfect pot-pourri"

13
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:27,110
"One man and 5 boys in this movie
turn everything into gold picture-perfectly!"

14
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,320
Tell me

15
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,310
- Will you tell or die?
- I swear I don't know

16
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,560
Tell me

17
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,630
You know
Where is he...?

18
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:32,710
Please don't beat me

19
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:32,720
- Did he tell...?
- No, he didn't, bro

20
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,130
However hard I hit
he isn't budging an incg

21
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,920
Death is circling you

22
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,260
Will you divulge
information or die?

23
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,510
Tell

24
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,570
Mumbai...!

25
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,760
Let go of me, bro

26
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,250
Spare my life, bro

27
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:51,250
I'm beg of you
to let me go

28
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,580
Cousin....?!

29
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:00,580
Why did you shoot him?

30
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,990
What if he had lied?

31
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,400
Not just Mumbai, whichever
corner of this world...

32
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,140
....they cannot
escape from me

33
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,390
THAILAND

34
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:18,440
BANGKOK

35
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:18,500
Indian guide?

36
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,860
Risky to trust them
We'll go on our own

37
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,110
- TRUE
- Let's move

38
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,270
Hey mister!
One Minute

39
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,020
Risk is my life
Possibility is my hope

40
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,980
Impossibility is my enemy

41
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,230
Danger is my game

42
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,690
So you want
Indian guide or not?

43
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,490
We don't need any guides

44
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:32,120
A student top priority is a guide

45
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,640
Lord Krishna was the guide
Pandavas in the Kurkeshetra war

46
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,180
Bhagavad gita, Quran, Bible
and your wives are also guides!

47
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,950
They lead our human lives

48
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,610
Very intersting

49
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:48,170
We need a guide
like you, please

50
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,220
Okay, let's move

51
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,310
Nice experience
Take this tip

52
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,400
I won't accept tips or gifts

53
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,800
That is my character

54
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,470
What a character

55
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,250
Sir, why isn't India developing like Bangkok
when we have so many wonderful tourist spots

56
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,130
Because India is a dirty country

57
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,210
Shut up

58
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,910
Not dirty india
Dirty politics

59
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,200
The Great India which is
being spoilt by dirty politics

60
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,190
Every state has party

61
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:21,310
Every party has color
and its own dress code

62
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,620
politicians don't even know
the spelling or meaning of MLA!

63
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,010
They make Mother India
bow her head in shame!

64
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,510
Oh! Cool, Naidu....calm down

65
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,140
Your sharp tounge
and hands are itching....

66
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,900
....to set things right
But they won't be of help

67
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:41,940
If I talk frankly in the Assembly
about our politicians...

68
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,700
...I'll end up creating tremors

69
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:52,460
Some people may take it
as a personal affront

70
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,470
You calm yourself down

71
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,720
India VS Australia

72
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,290
Come on
Try your luck

73
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:05,750
Everyone is betting
for Australia

74
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,750
No one is Bangkok is
betting for India

75
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,690
There is...me!

76
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,680
Praise be to India

77
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,500
India will win for sure

78
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,490
He's betting for India
in a losing match...funny guy!

79
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:22,260
In racing,records, rewards
in betting I am the ruling king

80
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,850
Shall I come to the point?

81
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,500
Ready?

82
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,460
Bro....India will win?!

83
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:33,460
Hew is overloaded with black money
in his back pocket, so he can afford it

84
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,150
Good way to change
black to white

85
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,610
1000 bucks
for india to lose

86
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,840
Opening the account

87
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,860
Keep 1000 ready to give me

88
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,060
He's abusing me?

89
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,520
No, bro

90
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,550
God gave him sound box
but forgot the speaker!

91
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:02,530
Can't talk
I am his voice over

92
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:05,090
Poor thing...he's dumb

93
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,610
India will lose
You also bet

94
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,580
Listen, bro, in any election
een the last vote counts!

95
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,070
Like how we cannot predict
a woman's mind till the last minute

96
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,710
Same way India's last ball
will decide its fate

97
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,590
It's all mine

98
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:22,590
Bro, even a losing match
India will come out a winner

99
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,360
In all ways
always I will win

100
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:41,510
Australia has won

101
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,189
- Whaaat?
- Yes

102
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,910
In this TV here
I saw India win

103
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,910
Someone has taken you
for a royal ride, bro

104
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:12,769
Smell these nots
Crisp fresh dollors

105
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:40,060
Our idea never fails...playing
a dvd of a winning match!

106
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:56,100
Catch him!

107
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,069
He's caught on to
ourtrick...let's run

108
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:59,329
You run ahead

109
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:00,170
Hey Lucky!

110
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,420
Bro...bro
Let's go

111
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,769
Our dad shouldn't know
about this betting matter

112
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:05,610
Correct, bro

113
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,439
Hi papa

114
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:09,790
Why did you eant
to see us urgently?

115
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,889
Who won?
Australia or India?

116
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:14,819
Breaking news of
our betting escapade, huh?

117
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:18,790
Now our bones
will be broken

118
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:25,509
We have money to buy
a pocket of cigarettes

119
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:27,069
But 6 pack body?

120
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:29,420
My dear sons!
Indoor or outdoor?

121
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,209
No, dad...don't

122
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:32,170
We won't do this again

123
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,819
You keep borrowing money from everyone
I'm so ashamed I can't even step out

124
00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:40,220
You are earning
with a fake dvd!

125
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,509
papa....!

126
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:47,269
We are teaching a lesson to those who take
short cuts to quick money and ruin families

127
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:50,620
Don't think you can fool me
with your smart Alec answers

128
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,459
Life is a like a book

129
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:56,730
The 1st and last pages are written by
God long ago as our birth and death

130
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:03,730
What we fill up in the blank
pages in between is our life

131
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,449
We are excelling
in our fill-up, dad

132
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:09,329
All we've been doing
is swimming in debts!

133
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,699
If we lose the pen
we can buy another one

134
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:18,850
But if we lose the pen cap
can we buy that alone?!

135
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,059
Fathers are generally cool like
'Navaratna' oil advertisement

136
00:11:22,059 --> 00:11:24,139
But like engine oil
you are so hot tempered

137
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:25,540
If you get a maid-

138
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,139
Sorry, if we had a mother...

139
00:11:28,139 --> 00:11:32,040
...we'd also have tender
loving care showered on us

140
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,639
Phone without sim
Network without signal

141
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,949
Children without mother are always
looked down upon by our society

142
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,559
Mother sentiment is
working out well

143
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:51,559
Mother, where are you?

144
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,300
Amma...?

145
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,139
Aunty....aunty
I'm ready

146
00:12:00,139 --> 00:12:04,040
Coming, Deepti

147
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,990
Hello sir

148
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:07,290
I hope you enjoyed
the rrr-ri-rides, sir

149
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:07,860
10,000 bahts

150
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,689
After all the hair-raising rides
our hormones have also risen

151
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:12,670
Where can we get
'hot' local gils?

152
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:12,949
(stammer)

153
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,499
He wants for tonight
not next year, tell fast

154
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:15,779
Honey....!

155
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,240
I don't know about the girls
Give me the money

156
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,699
- Get us the girls, we'll pay up
- Is there any problem?

157
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,199
Gopal, what's the problem?

158
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:28,839
They are not paying up

159
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,889
Hey! Son of dog
Give him the money

160
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:36,449
We only wanted an address
You gave us an awesome doll

161
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:43,449
'Miss Beautiful...hot and super
Her body soars in temperature"

162
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,249
Tell me-

163
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,749
Oh oh stop!

164
00:12:59,749 --> 00:13:02,160
You brother from
another mother!

165
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,809
I don't welcome violence

166
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,100
My school is to be just cool

167
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,999
If you fight for 1 minute
you lose 60 seconds of joy

168
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:08,730
Nice philosophy

169
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:08,980
Continue

170
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,249
You come here from India
for a holiday to relax

171
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,319
Pack up from frustrations
refresh and enjoy nature, brother

172
00:13:13,319 --> 00:13:15,749
Why are you trespassing
into our space? OUT!

173
00:13:15,749 --> 00:13:19,279
Vijju gets mad ehen
a finger is pointed at him!

174
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,279
Ask him to stop pointing
his finger at me like that

175
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:30,279
I won't
What will you do?

176
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:47,449
- Stop, Vijju will handle it
- I'll show him a thing or two

177
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,429
Vijju

178
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:26,490
Go away

179
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,059
Cool down, okay

180
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:27,839
I want ice cream

181
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,589
Deepti, check if the breakfast is ready
Tourists will land up any time now

182
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:31,059
Make it fast

183
00:14:31,059 --> 00:14:32,160
He's mad about ice cream

184
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,600
Hello...hey hey...Gopal!

185
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,509
You'll run the same
errand daily, huh?

186
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,829
- Yes, same job, daily
- We haven't made our 1st sale

187
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:39,490
When do you really sell?

188
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:41,480
How dare you
ridicule my restaurant!

189
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,389
Let me go and
cool down vijju

190
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:43,769
Cool?

191
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:47,089
Vijju...again getting
into a fist fight, huh?

192
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:52,249
How many times I've told you
not to get into a brawl

193
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:55,220
Your fight-count exceeds both hands
and runs into thousands!

194
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,209
You'll never give this up, huh?

195
00:14:57,209 --> 00:14:59,189
Why do you
always blame Vijju?

196
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:02,829
He was fighting those rogues
who tried to misbehave with me!

197
00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:04,110
Honey, don't defend him

198
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,889
Scold me, Honey

199
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:05,300
My mom will never
understand me

200
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,439
If I had a dad, he would have
hugged and appreciated me

201
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,259
Not scolds me
like my mom does

202
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:12,249
Phone without sim
Network without signal

203
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:17,749
Children without farther are always
looked down upon by our society

204
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:22,329
'Dad sentiment is
working out well for you!'

205
00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:23,480
My son...Vijju!

206
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:30,009
Sathya, however far you are
you'll always be close to my heart

207
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:37,009
We'll shoot a video of this
and sell it to Youtube!

208
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:48,929
- For what?
_ MMS craze

209
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:50,179
What game is it?

210
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,369
Excuse me?
Why are you lifting her?

211
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,309
Chinese love-climbing bell

212
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,439
If lovers ring the bell
then your love will succeed

213
00:15:56,439 --> 00:15:57,850
- Really?
- That's our belief

214
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,350
Vijju, that's 'true lovers' bell it seems

215
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,029
If you climb up and ring the bell
love you succeed it seems

216
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,420
People her believe this

217
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,459
So funny, ,right?

218
00:16:10,459 --> 00:16:11,850
For Honey's sake, huh?

219
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,199
Naturally

220
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:13,800
It's a waste of trying

221
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,220
Te...te...te-

222
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,369
in 10 days Honey is
flying off to Australia

223
00:16:17,369 --> 00:16:20,269
What's the use of
your love and give?

224
00:16:20,269 --> 00:16:24,730
Whether she flies to Australia
or out of space she'll belong to me

225
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,019
Why do you need this love
with so many hurdles?

226
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:31,589
My love has no hurdles, dude

227
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:35,449
She has no dad to
argue about our love

228
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:40,149
No mom to raise objections
No brothers to put a full stop

229
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,189
All she needs to do
is accept my love

230
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:45,209
I'll be there for her

231
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:46,819
Come with me, Honey

232
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,040
Vijju, where to?

233
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,300
You wanna have fun?

234
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:55,220
- Fun...?
- Come

235
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,139
Careful, Vijju

236
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:05,020
Ring the bell

237
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,980
Super

238
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,939
Congratulations

239
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,860
For what?

240
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,720
Do you know
that significance?

241
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,459
True lover's bell

242
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,350
If you ring it,
Love will be approved

243
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:24,779
Do you know Vijju loves you?

244
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,620
No, he just said 'let's have fun'

245
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:33,390
He didn't ring it saying
'let's wish for love'!

246
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,149
chillax!

247
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:41,149
Honey, get ready
for tonight's party

248
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:50,710
"Monday is maddening
Tuesday is burdening"

249
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:07,529
"Wednesday, pain in the wrong place
Thursday is head ache always"

250
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:21,279
"Friday's work load fries you from head to
toe

251
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:40,330
Saturday rejuvenates you with a glow"

252
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:54,370
"Happily, happily, paint the town red
Smile and sparkle gleefully spread"

253
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:15,200
"Saturday night...night
Joy and jubilance at its height"

254
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:24,640
"Saturday night...night
Joy and jubilance at its height"

255
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,080
"Refresh...recharge...restore
To carry through 5 days more"

256
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,330
"Reborn, rebuild, to re-begin
Resonate joys, rejoice within"

257
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:51,769
"Pack up problems flit and fly this fun day
High five, go high, freak out in every way"

258
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
"Happy, happily, live it up
Love and laughter no full stop"

259
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:25,850
"Saturday night...bright
Bliss and buoyance at its height"

260
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:36,980
"Switch off your mind today
Switch on your heart to play"

261
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,409
"Then...what about SUNDAY...?!

262
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:51,099
"Open (Mind) and deep sleep....!"

263
00:20:51,099 --> 00:20:53,919
- Cousin
- Tell me

264
00:20:53,919 --> 00:21:00,919
I've searched everywhere
except the sea, can't find them

265
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,059
How will I face uncle?

266
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,880
Meet Daulat bai

267
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,639
Who is that?

268
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,289
'They are not in Mumbai?'

269
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:14,779
You fool!

270
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:17,909
Are you playing
snooker or base ball?

271
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:21,760
Are you purposely
talking in a code language?

272
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,580
What happeened?

273
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,500
Why are you bullying small kids?

274
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:34,500
You call him a small kid?
He looks like a buffalo!

275
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,120
Wait...bro

276
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Then are you
a bear's neighbor?

277
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,899
Don't mess with me, Honey?

278
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:52,210
Which brand?
Dabur or Lion?!

279
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,850
Your face looks
like an oil can

280
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,370
And what kind
of name is Honey?

281
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:06,510
Jokers! Are you
troubling this girl?

282
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:10,500
Is this your honey-bee?!

283
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,500
I hate violence
You better stick to silence

284
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,960
You know, Vijju is an iron man

285
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:48,429
They he can
iron my shirts

286
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,139
Super, bro

287
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:54,419
Bro...does he sell br...bras?

288
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,279
Why add commas
after world?

289
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:03,559
I'm talking in commas but your
brother knows only full stop

290
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:10,559
If you have guts
try and hit me

291
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,659
Try and point
your finger at me

292
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:19,429
Go ahead

293
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:20,309
Point...point

294
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:25,549
What's the point of
all this commotion?

295
00:23:25,549 --> 00:23:32,549
What the hell are you talking here?

296
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:35,409
You are creating nuisance

297
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:38,639
Better tell him to stop
pointing his finger at me

298
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:43,289
You try messing up with me
I'll make mincemeat out of you

299
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,059
Let's go, we'll deal
with them later

300
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:53,019
This boat business is the best way to
bend the bones of the finger-fatal group

301
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:55,460
- We are in great soup
- What happened?

302
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:58,679
Our snooker-poker batch is
comperting with our boat business

303
00:23:58,679 --> 00:23:59,470
What happened?

304
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,860
Bro! That finger-fatal group is here

305
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,440
I'll deal with them

306
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:03,840
Vijju...?

307
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,620
They are pointing
their fingers at us

308
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,539
Instead of being in the An...
ani...Aniimal planet...

309
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:12,360
....Why are you parading
on this beach?

310
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,889
Instead of being in
the Po...po...pogo channel...

311
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:16,110
...why are you painting
our beach blue?

312
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:23,110
Why are you
spoiling for a fight?

313
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:30,870
We will uproot your flag with
our boat business on a firm footing

314
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:57,370
Vijju will bury you before you get
your hand or foot in the business

315
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,889
What is he saying?

316
00:26:11,889 --> 00:26:15,149
'Oil can' is pouring something?!

317
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:21,669
If you have gu...gu..guts
try pointing your finger at us

318
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:28,669
My father has said, if I point a finger
at you, 3 more point back at me!

319
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:34,320
If you want, I can
show something else

320
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,299
They are scared now
to point a finger at us!

321
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,790
Do you know
our background?

322
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:42,090
- Your underground is trembling
- What your glorious background?

323
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,730
The Great Dolly bhai

324
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,559
Mohanlal
Mammooty

325
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,970
We must attend the opening
of Ajay's boat business

326
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,220
Okay, boss

327
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,909
Dolly bhai is coming

328
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:49,080
- Greetings, bro
- Hello

329
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,639
Where is the inauguration?

330
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:51,320
Why late?

331
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,880
Are we late?

332
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,929
Let's go

333
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:55,490
Vijju, do something

334
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,799
Don't let them get a head start

335
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:57,840
Give it to me

336
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,840
Fast...before they come

337
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,500
Let's go

338
00:26:59,500 --> 00:26:59,840
Quickly

339
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,610
Go with courage in your heart and
bring back treasures of the sea!

340
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,490
Get on, sir

341
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:13,149
I feel like I am sitting on
actress Kareena's curves!

342
00:27:13,149 --> 00:27:14,380
Have fun

343
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,130
Dolly bhai take off

344
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:23,130
"Life is a beautiful journey
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?"

345
00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:41,879
"No one knows
what our future is?"

346
00:27:49,009 --> 00:27:56,009
My hands are stuck

347
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:04,090
Did you apply some
kind of glue or what?

348
00:28:07,659 --> 00:28:14,659
You invited me for opening function
but looks like my closing ceremony!

349
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:53,190
What has happened?

350
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:05,220
Save me

351
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:13,230
Save me, please

352
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:25,259
Every time you come up with
some problem or the other

353
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:09,360
All the jet ski-ing
equipments are spoilt

354
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:19,070
The handle is missing

355
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,860
DO something and
un-glue me from this

356
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:27,389
Drug dealer is your financier

357
00:30:27,389 --> 00:30:34,389
You arestarting
a business with his money

358
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,100
What's this vowel-language?

359
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,789
prem, look at him

360
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:50,789
Lucky, why get into such mess
when you are bad with lies?

361
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,850
Anyone does a mistake
you point a finger at me!

362
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:06,990
Always like this
from our childhood

363
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:11,980
If you mother was here
she'd have supported us

364
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,519
And ticked them off

365
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:19,820
Our father won't help us
Let's deal with them ourselves

366
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,389
Wait! Ball is in my court now

367
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:25,330
Whoever makes a mistake
is unanswerable to me

368
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,539
Whether my children
or someone else's

369
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:28,889
Who is inside?

370
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:30,240
come out

371
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,850
Do you have boys borna and
brought up the wrong way?

372
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,620
And they are messing
with my boy's business

373
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,659
Who is it?

374
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:39,960
"Sathya, I love you...you love me!"

375
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,789
"Sathya, I love you...you love me!"
Sathya, I touch you, you touch me"

376
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:44,429
"Dear God
My good lord!"

377
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:47,059
"When your beauty caresses me
Its fragrance...spreads gently"

378
00:31:47,059 --> 00:31:48,370
"I'm on cloud 9...really!"

379
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,289
"Sathya, I love you...you love me!"

380
00:31:50,289 --> 00:31:54,309
"Sathya, I love you...you love me!"
Sathya, I touch you, you touch me"

381
00:31:54,309 --> 00:31:57,440
"stood before you draped ina sari
will you kiss me...are yoou ready?"

382
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,340
"Kiss me soft and slow
Sit next to me, hug...don't go"

383
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,970
"Why talk and waste time here
Take me to the next level, dear"

384
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,419
"I'm on top of the world, darling!"

385
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,639
"His hormones working over time! Goodness
Not waiting till the wedding, avaricious!"

386
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:10,179
"My parents haven't said yes, but he says
no,

387
00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:13,320
he can't keep his hands off me somehow"

388
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,029
"Your curvaceous hip reminds
of soulful music from a clarinet, baby"

389
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:21,690
"Life is treating me
ever so beautifully"

390
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,649
"Sathya, I love you...you love me!"

391
00:32:25,649 --> 00:32:28,350
"Sathya, I love you...you love me!"

392
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:30,210
"Dear God
My good lord!"

393
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,190
"When your beauty caresses me
Its fragrance...spreads gently"

394
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,679
"I'm on cloud 9...really!"

395
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:36,769
Sathya!
I gave birtth to you

396
00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:38,559
No, daddy
My mother

397
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,450
Shut up

398
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,240
I brought you up

399
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,480
No, daddy
The maid did

400
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,769
Shut up!

401
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:46,649
My name is Subbu

402
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:50,580
My house is called dabbu (Money)

403
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:53,850
That is exactly your disease!

404
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,159
Shut up

405
00:32:55,159 --> 00:32:58,919
To be happy a man
needs 7 requirments

406
00:32:58,919 --> 00:32:59,809
Nore down

407
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:03,379
1 is air to breathe
2 is water

408
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:06,049
3 is food
4 is clothes

409
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:08,730
5 is money
6 is money

410
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:11,399
7 is money
8 is money-

411
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,629
You added 1 more extra

412
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:15,909
Cut the 8yh one

413
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:20,409
Where is the richest person?

414
00:33:20,409 --> 00:33:24,909
Right in front of me

415
00:33:24,909 --> 00:33:25,809
Good

416
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:29,190
Where is the poorest person?

417
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:33,169
In front of you, sir

418
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:35,549
Very very good

419
00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:40,370
What's the distance between
the loftiest and the lowliest?

420
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,820
6 feet, sir

421
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,659
Not the distance

422
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:45,499
Why would I gave
my daughter to you?

423
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:45,850
Virility

424
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,980
How many children
can you father?

425
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,120
How can I count the children
before marriage, sir?

426
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,309
How do I check
your manliness?

427
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:57,049
Give me and
I will prove my point

428
00:33:57,049 --> 00:33:58,980
What is your monthly income?

429
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,719
5 to 6

430
00:34:00,719 --> 00:34:02,470
- Lakhs?
- No, 100s

431
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,789
100 rupees per day

432
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:06,539
No, per month

433
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:11,190
Even my maid can't
adjust in that income!

434
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,929
I can, sir

435
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,679
I'll hit you

436
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,000
What will you adjust-

437
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,169
Shut up

438
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:19,220
Not that, sir-

439
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,520
What's your caste?

440
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,690
Are you particular about caste?

441
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:29,690
I am particular about
caste and cash

442
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:36,659
We are not compatible

443
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,190
Get out!

444
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,319
Mr Subbarao, why are you
obsessed with money?

445
00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:42,230
Money can buy everything
But not love or peace

446
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,190
Cool, Naidu....calm down

447
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,059
You are here to finialize
an alliance, not to cut family ties

448
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:50,530
You've won the girl's heart
now win over her father too!

449
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,879
Be cool and sail smooth!

450
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:53,089
Hello! Exit is that side

451
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:54,059
Father-in-law
Sorry, Mr Subbarao

452
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:56,280
If I exit, it will be after
marrying your daughter

453
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,510
Take my maid who is
ready to run with you

454
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:01,130
Shall I go sir?

455
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,270
I'll kill you
Go inside

456
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:04,750
Not her
You go inside

457
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,880
I'm helpless, Naidu

458
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,700
My dear madam....stop

459
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,559
Here's 500000 for you

460
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:14,450
I don't take dowry

461
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,180
Who said it is dowry?

462
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,099
It is for you to
give up my daughter

463
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:28,000
My love for your daughter
cannot be bought

464
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,819
Are you sure?

465
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:34,579
It can't be bought

466
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:35,930
Take this suitcase

467
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,339
Bend or send
I won't accept

468
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:41,920
10 or 15. I won't
fall for your bait

469
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,920
Who specified an amount?
Turn back and take a look

470
00:35:49,609 --> 00:35:52,869
This is an empty suitcase
I'll give you 6 months time

471
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:54,790
If you fill this suitcase
with Rs 500000

472
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,980
...I'll get you married
to my daughter

473
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,819
Otherwise-

474
00:35:57,819 --> 00:36:00,440
I'll be back with 500001

475
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,520
Mr Subbarao

476
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,770
However rich a man may be...

477
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:15,770
....when he sneezes it is 'ach'
not 'rich'! You can check if you like

478
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:27,520
I will be back

479
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,599
- Sathya...?
- Naidu!

480
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,599
I'm seeing you
after so many years

481
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,710
You look the same
Like an Ajanta sculpture

482
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,710
You look the same too
As tall as the Eiffel tower

483
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Your style and glamor
As awesomer as always

484
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,920
In 19-

485
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,940
Don't mention the year, Naidu

486
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,859
Why? Am I raking
forgotten memories?

487
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:26,180
No...age

488
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:30,839
After so many tears, are you
coming back for my sake?

489
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:34,710
I didn't even know
you lived here, Sathya

490
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:39,400
I came regarding those idiots
who are doing that boat business

491
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,740
Naidu! They are my sons

492
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,609
They are your sons...?

493
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:46,680
Who are the boys
fighting with my sons?

494
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,970
They are my sons!

495
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,940
- Your children?
- Yes

496
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,880
Sathya, keep your boys under control

497
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,440
Otherwise, you know what will
happen, if I lose my cool

498
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,089
I know

499
00:37:55,089 --> 00:38:00,839
My sons are also like you
you keep your boys under control

500
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,309
Take care

501
00:38:02,309 --> 00:38:04,500
Old love story

502
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,500
On the exterior
they seem to be fighting

503
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:15,900
Their feelings haven't
changed in the interior

504
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:18,309
I'll decode it and
get all the details

505
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:18,559
MUMBAI

506
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:23,119
You went to Bankok
and came back with...

507
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,280
...a fractured finger instead
of a 'sandwich massage'!

508
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,160
Don't rub it in
My son is in a bad mood

509
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,400
Please do something, bhai

510
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,640
Okay, I'll take care

511
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,260
Kill him

512
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,540
Where did you take this?

513
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,410
Bangkok

514
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:44,760
Siddha bhai, where are you?

515
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,119
Daulat bro
Got any news?

516
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,730
Got your stuff

517
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:55,210
Really?
Let me see

518
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:58,940
This is the girl
I've been looking for

519
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,109
Where is she?

520
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:00,890
In Bangkok

521
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,180
In Bangkok...?

522
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:01,430
My brother will see to it

523
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:01,660
He will finish
this deal for you

524
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,570
We found out
Honey's whereabouts

525
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,740
- Where?
- Bangkok

526
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,790
I'll come back
only with her

527
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,589
Inform uncle

528
00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:10,589
Why are you circling me?

529
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:17,589
Not just earth rotating, even life is a circle
You come back to where you began

530
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,240
That's how we met

531
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:36,240
You didn't, when you should have
Even if you do now, what's the use?

532
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:46,020
Whatever the time left
let us make good use of it

533
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:53,020
Sathya, I'm strong in taking a vow
But my weakness is not letting it go

534
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,079
Just as your father
challenged me...

535
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,650
...I earned that money by toiling
night and day in 5 months, not 6!

536
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,440
I came to your house dreaming of
seeing you ina wedding saree

537
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,140
But no one was there

538
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:07,270
I had no idea where
or how you were

539
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,200
I was devastated

540
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,690
Now you show up with your sons

541
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,339
They are not mine!

542
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:17,869
They are my father's secretary
Sambaiya uncle's sons

543
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:24,869
My father faced great loss
in his business and died

544
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:34,500
I adopted Sambaiya uncle's sons
as he also passed away, that's all

545
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:41,079
But I didn't get married or
have children like yiu did

546
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:48,079
My life started with Usha the sun
and set with 'Vennila' the moon

547
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,740
Usha, Vennila.....2 wives?!

548
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,710
Don't you know 'Usha' means
dawn and 'Vennila' means night?

549
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,780
What about your boys?

550
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,750
Let me tell you a secret
they themselves don't know

551
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,660
They are orphans

552
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,339
Wow! What a love story

553
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:11,670
- Love never has a expiry date
- Oh my god!

554
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,599
By the way I'm Honey

555
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,780
I'm Naidu

556
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,480
We think of our boys
as our future

557
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,160
Don't tell them
about our past

558
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,230
They will be distressed if they know
I'm not their biological mother

559
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,609
Yes, they can't bear it

560
00:41:31,609 --> 00:41:32,089
Okay....okay

561
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:37,660
I'll keep ita asecret provided you both
continue your unfinished Love story

562
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,530
Get married and start
your 2nd innings

563
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:40,930
Okay?

564
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:45,369
'Children without mother are always
looked down upon by our society'

565
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:49,000
'If our mother was here
she'd have supported us'

566
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,609
'And ticked them off'

567
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:57,380
'If my father was here
he'd have supported me'

568
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:00,930
'And ticked them off'

569
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:07,119
What's all this fa..fa..father
mother and marriage?

570
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,510
When time favors you
a father walks into your life

571
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,900
...when you're yourself
as old as a father!

572
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:22,309
Whether he crawls or walks
we don't need a father!

573
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,829
Gopal, you shut up!

574
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:28,880
Do you know
what a father is?

575
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,880
One who worries about his kids
without worrying about himself

576
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,280
Great gift given by God

577
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,549
That is dad

578
00:42:42,549 --> 00:42:43,930
You can convince us

579
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:47,150
But how will this
wicked world react?

580
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,069
Goddamn world!

581
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:52,660
When your mom was working
with blood, sweat and tears...

582
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:55,910
...did that wicked world
lend her a kerchief?

583
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,260
Don't lose out
on a dad's love

584
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,520
Same goesa to those
motherless children!

585
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,619
Which motherless children?

586
00:43:02,619 --> 00:43:04,079
Just kids
Small kids

587
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,640
1 of those boys
can't even talk!

588
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:07,740
Oh my God!!

589
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:13,970
I don't care
what this world thinks

590
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:18,690
I'll make sure
my mom gets married

591
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,390
I'll welcome my dad

592
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:26,390
He's as old as a lighthouse
and he is falling in love now?

593
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,740
College love
Not now

594
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:34,200
They want to make
yesterday love blossom!

595
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,140
We'll get them married

596
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:39,040
Uncle and aunty
get married, huh?

597
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,010
Sounds awful

598
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:43,400
We are ourselves
dying to get married

599
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:50,400
You are thinking of love, marriage
and on top of it, gain our support

600
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:01,750
We Won't agree at all

601
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,460
Shut up

602
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:11,460
Do you know
who the mother is?

603
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:20,940
God cannot be with us all the time
So he created an option: mother

604
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,869
Mother is a Goddess
without a temple

605
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:30,180
When such a mother knocks at your
door, you think it's your money lender

606
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,250
And refuse to
open the door!

607
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:33,290
Your bad luck

608
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:34,380
I need a mom

609
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,780
I need more details about her

610
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,369
That mother has...2 children

611
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:39,170
2 children?

612
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:39,790
Just this small

613
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:40,730
One is learning
to talk only now

614
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:46,349
Even then
we must see them

615
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:49,099
They are preparing for
their kindergarten exam!

616
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:49,490
What?

617
00:44:49,490 --> 00:44:56,490
At the wedding, they will
appear as your gifts!

618
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,520
Agreed

619
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,589
Hello...slow motion

620
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:06,589
Already a late marriage
and you are delaying it further

621
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,390
Witnesses?

622
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:21,180
He is the groom's witness
She is the bride's witness

623
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:21,609
You?

624
00:45:21,609 --> 00:45:26,460
You 'Weeping Buddha'!
What does it matter who I am?

625
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,430
Register their marriage

626
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:31,410
Sign, uncle

627
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:33,390
Aunty, quick

628
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:36,609
But the boys
aren't here as yet

629
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:43,609
Auspicious timne will pass
by the time they land up

630
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,089
Come...fast...fast

631
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:44,859
Sign here

632
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,020
Wedding is over

633
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,190
Happy married life

634
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:49,890
Why is my left eye
suddenly twitching?

635
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:53,430
My whole body is trembling

636
00:45:53,430 --> 00:46:00,430
Wonder what will happen now

637
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:12,280
"Unexpressed words in your smile"

638
00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:24,130
What is this?
Marriage is over?

639
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:36,670
We had to register before
the inauspicious time set in

640
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:38,270
Dear, my sons

641
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,339
OUR sons!

642
00:46:39,339 --> 00:46:42,869
Where have you
arranged the feast?

643
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:48,640
Let's go look for
our younger brothers!

644
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,930
Little bro..junior..where are you?

645
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:55,170
My dad is a bride groom

646
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,240
Now we have a mom
who'll feed us

647
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:00,910
Why are you staring?

648
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:03,579
We 2
They are 2

649
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:06,250
You are 3
Total 7

650
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,520
If we live together
we can be happy

651
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,130
As 1 family

652
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,730
Not happy
Un-happy!

653
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:16,400
I'll never live with them

654
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,470
Me too

655
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,069
Cancel this marriage

656
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:19,609
Dearest...?

657
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:22,280
Just now they got married?

658
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:24,950
That's why it is easy

659
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:28,690
Throw that garland
on her face, dad

660
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,640
I'll get you a new one

661
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:37,250
I'll punch your face before that!

662
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:44,250
Don't laugh too much
Next will be your 'tooth pick bro'

663
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:49,950
At least now stop all these
squabbles and quarrels

664
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,059
We didn't get married
for selfish reasons

665
00:47:55,059 --> 00:48:02,059
But to give you the parents' love
you all missed out on!

666
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,180
Be united from now on

667
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,280
With them?

668
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,930
- Impossible
- It is Impossible

669
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:25,930
They will be staying
with us from tomorrow

670
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:38,109
Okay, dear?

671
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:43,260
I know
Dad will say 'no'

672
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:49,450
Ajay, sons should
respect parents' wishes

673
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:56,450
Husband should see
the wife's point of view

674
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:04,710
This is her 1st wish as my wife
It is my duty to fullfill it

675
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:18,369
I intend staying
with her from tomorow

676
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:25,369
If you want to come
you are most welcome

677
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,609
Uncle...!

678
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:48,410
Aunty...?

679
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:55,410
Gopal, get up

680
00:49:59,819 --> 00:50:03,619
Aunty!!

681
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:10,619
Uncle, where is your luggage?

682
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:29,640
Did you come
to drop uncle here?

683
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,680
Yeah! Heis a school kid and
we must drop him in his hostel

684
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:58,690
We came because
mom asked us to

685
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:12,039
Wherever mom and dad are
we will also be, naturally!

686
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,039
Vijju....?

687
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:31,760
Rambo is angry

688
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,049
Salutations to mother

689
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:41,049
Whenever we asked for a mom
dad would buy us new toy

690
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:09,069
We'll see our mom in that doll
That's how we grew up

691
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:24,480
1st time we are
seeing a mom 'live'

692
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,549
Yes, mom, we've been
waiting for a mom's affection

693
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:33,250
"Greetings, my dear mother"

694
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,299
"A big hello...to my mom dear"

695
00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:41,869
"May you be happy, dears
May you live for 100 years"

696
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:48,869
"Like a star in the sky, shine
Spread joy like the sun sublime"

697
00:52:49,180 --> 00:52:51,430
"Greetings, my dear-"

698
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:58,430
Why is he hurrying in
with a hammer, bro?

699
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:15,220
No, don't, Vijju
I invited them, no?

700
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:57,859
They are your brothers

701
00:54:03,170 --> 00:54:10,170
Natural for them to stay
with their parents, right?

702
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:18,880
True, Vijju
That's why they are here

703
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:26,150
Mom, which room
will they occupy?

704
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:28,349
Your room

705
00:54:28,349 --> 00:54:33,839
Wh...where will we be?
Sto...stor-

706
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:40,839
You'll be in the sto...store room
and we'll be in the bed room

707
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,849
You take this room
And relax

708
00:54:55,849 --> 00:54:57,460
I won't

709
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:04,460
Only because your bads luck took
an U turn, you are here with us

710
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:26,980
If you act up, nail to be hit
on the wall will be in your-

711
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:30,490
Hearts's ce...cen...cent-

712
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:33,089
Got it
Let's go

713
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:33,740
Understood?

714
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,700
Oho! Romantic couple

715
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,000
Uncle..... happy?

716
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,609
Wait for 2 days

717
00:55:39,609 --> 00:55:45,470
I'll make the fighting brothers
turn into '5 pandavas'

718
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:48,730
Oh sorry
You carry on

719
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,380
Honey

720
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:55,900
Uncle, I'm so happy
to see you both like this

721
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,160
- All the best
- Thank you

722
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:06,160
Sathya, thanks to Honey
who made us one happy family

723
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:22,710
True, dear

724
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:27,440
It would be great if Honey also
becomes part of our family

725
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,380
She is made for Vijju

726
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:32,430
Vijju, why did you
bring me this far?

727
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,020
I'll tell you

728
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:33,950
Fishing net?

729
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:34,880
Hold it

730
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,279
Put it down

731
00:56:36,279 --> 00:56:39,549
Why didn't you
bring me here before?

732
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:41,890
Everything has a time, no?

733
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:42,819
Come here

734
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:43,289
See

735
00:56:43,289 --> 00:56:44,690
Wow! Beautiful island

736
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:47,490
Vijju, look at that gold fish

737
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,660
I - love - you

738
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:52,650
Vijju, I love you

739
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:56,650
I love you too

740
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:57,650
Honey....?

741
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,809
Do I take your silence
as acceptance?

742
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:04,339
"Don't stare at me persistently
Don't kill me provokingly"

743
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:11,339
"Thoughts of you drive me crazy
my precious Honey bee!"

744
00:57:16,839 --> 00:57:23,839
"No tiny green chilly bites please
of my pink cheeks...don't tease"

745
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:37,039
"As second skin when you hug me
Intoxicated...giddy...I get dizzy"

746
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:44,309
"You cling to me
like jasmine fragrantly"

747
00:57:57,089 --> 00:58:04,089
"You are like a loaded pistol
blasting my heart out of control"

748
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:14,779
"Glit...glit...glittering
Step...step...stepping"

749
00:58:14,779 --> 00:58:21,109
"Only you can be
my dream gorl tottaly"

750
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:27,220
"Shall I pinch You impishly?
Shall I embrace you gently?"

751
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:34,220
"Shall I give my heart to you?
Shall I give my love so true?"

752
00:58:53,230 --> 00:59:00,230
"Without water
a plant can't flower"

753
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:19,240
"Without you in my life
I face emptiness and strife"

754
00:59:26,359 --> 00:59:33,359
"Life without a soul-mate
is a hollow hellish state"

755
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:39,890
"If you are by my side
every moment is a joy ride"

756
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:44,430
"My life went winding
thanks to you like a spring"

757
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,160
"Like a cyclone you enveloped me
darling, with gestures stormily"

758
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:48,809
"Shim...shim...shimmering
Wow..wa...waltz...waltzing"

759
00:59:48,809 --> 00:59:52,339
"Only you can be
my chimera completely"

760
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:59,339
"I'm prisoner of your love sublime
I won't leave you till the end of time"

761
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:07,339
"Is your smile a combustion
of love potion or ammunition?"

762
01:00:07,339 --> 01:00:12,390
"Thief of yesterday, today, tomorrow
You've opened my heart's window"

763
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:15,829
"Is there a knife or scissor
in your sharp glance of fervot"

764
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:18,539
"Oh God! Your eyes expressively
sliced the mango-like delicious me"

765
01:00:18,539 --> 01:00:25,539
"Like a new ball, you made me
cross new boundaries gladly"

766
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:34,760
"You made me jump with joy
to everlastingly enjoy"

767
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,869
"Shine...shine...shining
Tan...tang...tangoing"

768
01:00:35,869 --> 01:00:40,279
"My dream girl lovely
My one and only"

769
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:47,279
"Shall I build you a temple in my heart?
For me to prostrate from begining to start?"

770
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:13,869
"If you ask won't I die for you?
My only true love, my beau"

771
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:16,640
Honey! I've got
good news for you

772
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,809
You've got your visa
to go to Australia

773
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:24,170
What...you look so dull when
I've given you such great news

774
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:31,170
God always gives me everything
but temporarily and he takes it all back

775
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:07,500
When I was missing my family
Vijju professed his love to me

776
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:26,180
So quickly God is
taking it away from me

777
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:20,269
I van't lose my happiness this time

778
01:04:31,289 --> 01:04:38,289
Isn't this what you were
waiting for so long?

779
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:42,640
I wanted to go to Australia
for a better life

780
01:05:53,619 --> 01:06:00,529
How can I get
a better life than this?

781
01:06:00,529 --> 01:06:07,529
So I wish to become
part of this family

782
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:18,519
"You for you, me for me
that's how life will be"

783
01:06:27,890 --> 01:06:33,839
Why this red...raging anger

784
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:38,299
I'm feeling sleepy

785
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:44,250
"Lord Krishna and Brindavan..."

786
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:51,250
You should always be
the 5 united brothers

787
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:05,470
"Lord Krishna and Brindavan
Belong equally to everyone"

788
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:51,089
Mom has left

789
01:07:51,089 --> 01:07:54,099
Let's switch to
the sports channel

790
01:07:54,099 --> 01:07:57,109
Papa's gone
Let's watch Pop channel

791
01:07:57,109 --> 01:08:01,119
Whoever has the remote
will decide the channel

792
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:02,619
I got it

793
01:08:02,619 --> 01:08:03,630
Let me

794
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,630
No, I can manage

795
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:07,140
Listen to me-

796
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:12,349
I told you I can manage
Why are you pestering me?

797
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:17,109
Vijay! How could you?
Apologize at once to your dad

798
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:19,920
Sathya, he didn't mean to-

799
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:26,109
My mother...her wish
She can hit me or yell at me

800
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:29,639
Who are you to
come in between?

801
01:08:29,639 --> 01:08:34,319
Don't poke your nose
You have no right to talk

802
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:36,830
You shattered my happy life
bringing these people in

803
01:08:36,830 --> 01:08:40,909
He got married to my mom
for this house, not for love

804
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:45,830
Don't you dare deride my dad?
Is this Bangkok palace or what?

805
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,609
It's a goddamn hell
within 4 walls

806
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:50,940
What rubbish
are you blabbering?

807
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:53,190
Vijju, stop it

808
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:58,609
Why are you fighting instead of
accepting each other as brothers?

809
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:01,350
They can never
become our brothers

810
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,719
Neither you our dad

811
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,480
Didn't I tell you right then
not to come and stay here?

812
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,420
But you insisted

813
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,929
You made a big mistake
marrying him, mom

814
01:09:09,929 --> 01:09:10,870
Vijju....my dear son

815
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,120
I am so sorry

816
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:15,020
I'm to blame for all this
stredd and distress

817
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,159
Don't worry, Sathya

818
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:23,159
Their age to make us worry
Ours to take it in our stride

819
01:09:29,489 --> 01:09:31,380
By the time children
understand their parents...

820
01:09:31,380 --> 01:09:35,350
...they will become parents who will
be questioned by their children!

821
01:09:35,350 --> 01:09:38,940
That's when they will realize
what it is to be in our shoes

822
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:41,210
This is the human psychology
of every generation

823
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,279
Generation will change

824
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:44,429
But human psychology
will never change

825
01:09:44,429 --> 01:09:47,299
All said and done
they are our children

826
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:48,020
Of course

827
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,449
Of course, your children!

828
01:09:49,449 --> 01:09:51,730
Orphans whom you adopted
to shower mother's love

829
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:54,800
Hoisted them on
your shoulder as a dad

830
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,840
Teaching them to
take their 1st step

831
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,750
Gave them the best life ever
from the bottom of your hearts

832
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,199
This was your big blunder

833
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:08,199
You were the answer to their lives
which was a huge question mark

834
01:10:27,639 --> 01:10:32,350
And you changed your lives into
a question, your next big mistake

835
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:36,520
If I tell them their true lineage-

836
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:37,210
Honey!

837
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:42,230
They won't be able
to bear the truth

838
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:49,230
They only lacked the luxury
their mother's milk, that's all

839
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:55,610
They think I am
their biological father

840
01:10:55,610 --> 01:11:01,060
By blurting out the truth you will
ruin the reason for our wedding

841
01:11:01,060 --> 01:11:03,810
Even if we didn't
give birth to them

842
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:05,980
...they are our children totally

843
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:06,409
Lucky!!

844
01:11:06,409 --> 01:11:08,000
Lucky, where are you taking us?

845
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,370
Why did you bring the-

846
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,909
Why did you come here?

847
01:11:10,909 --> 01:11:11,159
What...?

848
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,179
What is he blabbering?

849
01:11:12,179 --> 01:11:13,060
What are you saying?

850
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,850
Their mother is not
their real mother?

851
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:15,620
Are they orphans?

852
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:16,389
Don't talk rubbish

853
01:11:16,389 --> 01:11:17,409
Take your hands off me

854
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:19,070
You've gone
absolutely loony

855
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:21,130
What Lucky says is true

856
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:22,040
I knew this
before he found out

857
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:28,909
Uncle and aunty made me promise
not to tell you but he overheard it tonight

858
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:30,570
Super, Lucky!

859
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:33,030
1st time you spoke
and shocked everyone

860
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,489
Was your mother wrong?

861
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:39,350
One who raises a child cherishes
the act more than one who gives birth

862
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:45,790
She set aside her own love and
showered affection on to you

863
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:47,400
She was wrong

864
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,550
Was your dad wrong?

865
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:53,850
For your life's sake
he forsake his life

866
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,000
He was also wrong

867
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,219
Why did our mother
hide it from us?

868
01:12:01,219 --> 01:12:08,219
What would you have done
If she had told you?

869
01:12:11,989 --> 01:12:18,989
Why did my dad not tell us?
I will ask him directly

870
01:12:20,550 --> 01:12:22,590
What will you ask?

871
01:12:22,590 --> 01:12:29,590
Why did you step in as my dad?

872
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:41,150
He didn't want you to know
because you'd be devastated

873
01:12:41,150 --> 01:12:48,150
Now go and tell
'we know the truth'

874
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,210
And make things
worse for them

875
01:13:04,210 --> 01:13:07,130
Go and do that immediately

876
01:13:07,130 --> 01:13:10,290
Honey, none of us will
talk about this any more

877
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:13,440
Lucky, you didn't over hear anything
You didn't anyone anything

878
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,650
This truth will be
forgotten right here

879
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:17,580
They will always
be our parents

880
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,530
We shouldn't upset them anymore

881
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:21,929
Honey, you brought
the entire family one roof

882
01:13:21,929 --> 01:13:28,929
Those who fought
signed peace treaty

883
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:38,199
I'll celebrate this happy moment
with aunty and uncle

884
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:57,400
I'll confirm my love for Vijay
in front of everyone

885
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:02,960
- Why is Reena here?
- For your sake

886
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,230
Why so late?

887
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:04,650
Sorry

888
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:05,469
What's the ne-news?

889
01:14:05,469 --> 01:14:07,710
I'll tell once aunty
and uncle are here

890
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:13,100
Didn't tell you there is
something special brewing?

891
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:14,969
Naughty fellow!

892
01:14:14,969 --> 01:14:16,850
Onew minute

893
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:21,530
Hello uncle
Where are you?

894
01:14:21,530 --> 01:14:26,219
Why haven't you come here?

895
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,090
Found her

896
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,969
Take her

897
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:34,650
Who the hell are you?

898
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:41,650
You are asking me
what I should asking you!

899
01:14:54,900 --> 01:15:01,900
Who is she to you?

900
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:09,290
Try touching her
and you will know

901
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,929
Finish him

902
01:15:17,929 --> 01:15:23,440
Isn't it wrong to try and kill
my broyher in front of my eyes?

903
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,050
Let go of me

904
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:28,530
If you touch my dad
it is like touching my heart!

905
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:29,739
- Hey! Come
- Leave her

906
01:15:29,739 --> 01:15:34,750
Who the hell are you
coming in between?

907
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,780
Where are you rushing away?

908
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:41,190
Vijju, don't come

909
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:44,710
If you don't give me honey
I'll slice her throat

910
01:15:44,710 --> 01:15:49,420
A single drop of my mother's blood
and you'll be hanging headless!

911
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:50,590
Don't
Stop it

912
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:56,420
They have come for me
from my home town

913
01:15:56,420 --> 01:16:00,800
I have to go with them

914
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:07,800
I called you all today
to tell you about my past

915
01:16:09,790 --> 01:16:16,790
The same past has
caught up with me

916
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:21,060
Please let me go

917
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:28,060
I'm sorry, I told you
I was an orphan, uncle

918
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:35,150
It is only right on my part
to go back with them

919
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:38,690
Don't, Honey

920
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:43,210
What bloody don't
You better come

921
01:16:43,210 --> 01:16:45,469
Don't hurt aunty

922
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:49,030
Why are you
playing the martyr?

923
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:50,280
You come along

924
01:16:50,280 --> 01:16:54,639
If anyone moves to save her
you won't see her alive

925
01:16:54,639 --> 01:17:00,510
If you hide in Bangkok
did you think ik can't catch you?

926
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:03,239
Enough of staring
Get into the car

927
01:17:03,239 --> 01:17:05,270
Don't worry, sir
She'll be alright

928
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:06,280
thank you, doctor

929
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:07,969
How is your daughter now?

930
01:17:07,969 --> 01:17:09,320
My daughter is fine

931
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:15,830
But what she and I feared about
Honey's past has happened

932
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:19,909
Why did Honey hide
her past from all of us?

933
01:17:19,909 --> 01:17:24,090
To know the details, 1st I must
brief you not about Honey

934
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:31,090
'But about 2 villages in the border
of 2 states, Andhra and Karnataka'

935
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:34,719
'One is Pandavapuram
Another is Kauravapuram'

936
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,429
'Dharma'nna is a big shot
in Pandavapuram

937
01:17:37,429 --> 01:17:39,790
'He is like the adopted son of Dharma'

938
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:41,770
'Suyodhana is a big wig
in kauravapuram'

939
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:44,850
'He is like the illegitimate son
to atrocities and adharma'

940
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:47,920
'For all his misdeeds
his children were his weapons'

941
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,929
'There is also a story to these villages
like a page from our history texts'

942
01:17:52,929 --> 01:17:55,170
'Residents of Pandavapuram
used to indulge in dance drama'

943
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,020
'....playing the roles of
only the Pandavas'

944
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,120
'The same held good for Kauravapuram
who enacted roles of Kauravas only'

945
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:07,980
'In the course of time, each had
thier own identity and family tree'

946
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:14,850
'When people all over celebrated
the harvesting festival in mid January...'

947
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:21,090
'...these 2 groups contested over
some issue annually without fail!'

948
01:18:21,090 --> 01:18:28,090
'They gambled even to the extent of
staking their mothers or daughters'

949
01:18:28,580 --> 01:18:35,580
'One particular year, Suyodhana schemed
a betting game with bad intentions wherein...'

950
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:45,600
'....the loser should not celebrate
any happy event for 14 years'

951
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:04,040
'But he lost the game and fell
into the hole he dug for them'

952
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:09,820
'So Suyodhana's sons could
never get married for 14 years'

953
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,340
'After the stipulated time
they got a chance to take revenge'

954
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:20,139
You are back after 14 years to
gamble with us, what's your bet?

955
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:27,139
If I lose I'll donate my wealth to
the people of both villages entirely

956
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:38,340
I'll leave this place along with
my family never to return

957
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:41,929
But if you lose, your daughter
should become my daughter-in-law!

958
01:19:41,929 --> 01:19:47,650
Accept this, sir, because if we lose
only our family will pay the price

959
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:50,860
But if we win
both villages benefit

960
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:51,350
Okay

961
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:52,350
Super, father

962
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:54,610
I'll fix the wedding date

963
01:19:54,610 --> 01:20:01,610
You get your daughter ready for
the wedding and to bid you farewell

964
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:06,530
You played your cards right with
your eye-talk at the right time, Ranga

965
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:09,239
So I'm duty bound to
'help' you...see you!

966
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:13,639
'He silenced Ranga by burying him
dust to dust, ashes to ashes cleverly'

967
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:17,020
We never thought Ranga would
betray us in this manner

968
01:20:17,020 --> 01:20:24,020
Brother, you are sticking to fair play
but won through foul play

969
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Your daughter, Honey's life
should not get ruined like this

970
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:39,060
Don't think twice, let Honey stdy
in Australia just as she wanted

971
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:46,060
It is my duty to ensure she is safe
in Bangkok till she gets her visa

972
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:55,219
This is how Honey
came to live with me

973
01:20:55,219 --> 01:20:56,360
She got her visa

974
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:03,360
Since Vijay professed his love to her
choosing your family over her plans....

975
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:07,460
...she tore her visa impulsively

976
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:14,460
I'm petrified what those
brutes will do to Honey

977
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:15,260
Father...mother...!

978
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:16,040
Sister....?

979
01:21:16,040 --> 01:21:18,380
My dear Honey...!

980
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:24,030
You gave some sob story
your daughter ran away

981
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:27,130
From now on, Your daughter
will stay only in our house

982
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:32,389
You just attend the wedding, bless her,
eat your stomach's content and go

983
01:21:32,389 --> 01:21:32,840
Start...drive

984
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,199
Move away, cousin

985
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:34,650
Come

986
01:21:34,650 --> 01:21:38,570
I'm helping you get even
with your 14 year-feud, uncle

987
01:21:38,570 --> 01:21:38,969
Bravo!

988
01:21:38,969 --> 01:21:39,369
Move

989
01:21:39,369 --> 01:21:41,920
Your bed is waiting
for you to lie on!

990
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:43,980
No savior will come to
your rescue, save your tears

991
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,670
"Siblings 5 and bee like flowers scented
Smiling, con, connive enchanted"

992
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,380
This is Suyodhana's house

993
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:49,540
Entering his house is as good
as entering a tiger's cage

994
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:51,730
Inhabitants are not human
But she-demons!

995
01:21:51,730 --> 01:21:55,369
However dangerous they are
we won't go back without Honey

996
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:56,100
Not that-

997
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,429
Will you help us or not?

998
01:21:58,429 --> 01:22:05,429
Okay, tonight you'll enter the house
by hiding in Sathy's water tanker

999
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:11,960
Damu, fill up our tanks quickly

1000
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,619
- Come here
- Why?

1001
01:22:14,619 --> 01:22:21,510
Watch this new video of
a fake God man's romance!

1002
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:28,510
Why are you snoring away to glory
instead of guarding the place?

1003
01:22:28,900 --> 01:22:34,199
Till the wedding, you are supposed
to guard silently, not snore loudly

1004
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:35,090
Sorry, boss

1005
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:40,469
If you mess it up
you'll be minus your head

1006
01:22:40,469 --> 01:22:42,880
Go back to guarding

1007
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:43,480
Come

1008
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,110
I'm here to make
Pandavapuram listen...

1009
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:46,530
...to your tenacity and durability
of our Kauravapuram mattress!

1010
01:22:46,530 --> 01:22:48,199
Why are you acting pricey?

1011
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:50,199
He is after all youe fiance!

1012
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:54,210
Instead of hugging him tight
why are you moving away in fright?

1013
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:54,550
Eat

1014
01:22:54,550 --> 01:22:55,500
Don't test my patience

1015
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,659
I'll brand her by this hot ladle
and make her surrender to you

1016
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:01,550
Come, my dear nephew

1017
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:02,500
See you

1018
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:02,969
Vijju...?

1019
01:23:02,969 --> 01:23:03,440
Vijju...!

1020
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:05,340
I love you, Vijju
I missed you

1021
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:06,280
I know

1022
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:10,060
How did your come here
all by yourself-

1023
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:15,489
We are here as 1 family
to take you back with us

1024
01:23:15,489 --> 01:23:17,750
I can't come, Vijju

1025
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:22,340
Why are you scared?
We are here for you

1026
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:26,280
I'm not scared for my life
But for my parents

1027
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:27,650
If you try to escape
We won't hunt you down

1028
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:34,650
But you'll come back in search
of your parent's dead bodies!

1029
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:47,260
I can't for sake my parents
for the sake of my love

1030
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:47,730
Well said

1031
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:49,750
You told me your parents are
more important to you than your love

1032
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:50,840
I'll convince your father
and take you back formally

1033
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:51,090
Leave...leave

1034
01:23:50,869 --> 01:23:52,790
Have you come to save her
all the way from Bangkok?

1035
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:54,969
You are caught handed

1036
01:23:54,969 --> 01:24:01,540
We'll make you 'dust to dust'
ashes to ashes' in our quarry!

1037
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,080
Uncle...!

1038
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:08,070
What's this noise
in the middle of the nigh-?

1039
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:12,280
Why is the mace on the floor?

1040
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,699
Irt has got dented

1041
01:24:14,699 --> 01:24:15,580
Why buy trouble?

1042
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,699
They will only pray
and not scrutinize it

1043
01:24:17,699 --> 01:24:19,550
Put it back but
turn it the other way

1044
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:23,360
If they find out about the mace
it is the end of us in this place

1045
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:27,520
Look! Fully drunk, he is rolling
on the floor like an empty bottle

1046
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,600
He is bleeding

1047
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:34,980
This 1 year of living in disguise
will be a boon to you, Yudhishtra

1048
01:24:34,980 --> 01:24:41,980
You'll get back to your original
as soon as this year is over

1049
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:44,429
Thank you, Lord Krishna

1050
01:24:44,429 --> 01:24:51,429
More than my affection for Honey
your love for my daughter is priceless

1051
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:56,730
She's really very fortunate

1052
01:24:56,730 --> 01:25:02,909
But not lucky enough to
become a part of your family

1053
01:25:02,909 --> 01:25:07,550
Even if we agree for this alliance
the 2 villages will oppose our decision

1054
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:14,550
We have to face the consequences
of our (mis)deeds and karma therein

1055
01:25:15,989 --> 01:25:22,989
You are upset because
you are so virtuous

1056
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:28,119
Was it right of Kaikeyi to send Rama in exile
even though Dasaratha granted her a boon?

1057
01:25:28,119 --> 01:25:35,119
Kauravas exiling Pandavas
since they lost in the dice game...

1058
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:47,889
....so be it as per rules
But is it motally right?

1059
01:25:47,889 --> 01:25:51,449
You agreed to let your daughter
marry into this family, if you lost

1060
01:25:51,449 --> 01:25:55,340
So rule-wise you are right
But they won through deceit

1061
01:25:55,340 --> 01:26:00,710
I want to share ups and
downs of my life with Honey

1062
01:26:00,710 --> 01:26:02,060
I'll rescue Honey

1063
01:26:02,060 --> 01:26:05,340
It is not an easy task as you think

1064
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,520
Determination will decidew
the impossible in our favor

1065
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:11,570
Let us use all the illusive
and elusive tricks possible

1066
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:16,530
By begging, black mailing
insisting, intimidating

1067
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:20,659
By changing or cheating them

1068
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:27,659
Make them lose their mind
or diverting their mindset

1069
01:26:28,090 --> 01:26:35,090
We'll rescue Honey who
made us 1 happy family...

1070
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:42,520
...by making Suyodhana himself mend
his ways and make her our daughter-in-law

1071
01:26:45,429 --> 01:26:49,570
What is our plan, father?

1072
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:50,619
With divine help
we will succeed

1073
01:26:50,619 --> 01:26:52,010
If necessary, we can
win through astrology

1074
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,030
Like the eunuch Brihnnala
in Mahabharatha

1075
01:26:53,030 --> 01:26:57,440
...I'll teach music and dance
to the queen and princesses

1076
01:26:57,440 --> 01:27:03,780
Like Valala the head cook i will enter
the royal kitchen of king Viratta

1077
01:27:03,780 --> 01:27:05,590
What is your disguise?

1078
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:10,929
I'll be Granthic who will attend
to the horses in the stable

1079
01:27:10,929 --> 01:27:12,179
What about you?

1080
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:14,560
I'll go as Sairandhri, beautician and
lady-in-waiting to the queen

1081
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:17,699
Remember, even if one of us is found out
in this 1 year of being incognito...

1082
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,030
...We will be exited again

1083
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,630
Murari, does Suyodhana
have any friends?

1084
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:21,159
Landlord Buridi

1085
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:27,350
There is a family wedding
tomorrow in his house

1086
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:28,530
Greetings

1087
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:30,900
Suyodhana, welcome

1088
01:27:30,900 --> 01:27:33,429
You are the master of gambling
Your game awaits you

1089
01:27:33,429 --> 01:27:36,130
You bachelor boys!
Colored sarees await you this side

1090
01:27:36,130 --> 01:27:36,429
Come...come

1091
01:27:36,429 --> 01:27:37,659
praise be to Lord Shiva

1092
01:27:37,659 --> 01:27:44,139
Who the hell are you?
You are dressed up funnily

1093
01:27:44,139 --> 01:27:51,139
If you ask in the eastren direction
the sun will update you

1094
01:27:52,429 --> 01:27:55,210
If you ask West
wind will answer

1095
01:27:55,210 --> 01:27:58,780
If you ask North
God of time will replay

1096
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:04,350
If you Siuth God of death
will inform you of your time of death

1097
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:07,960
1 look at us, death
will be 'scared to death'!

1098
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:13,159
You nitwits! 14 minutes from now,
you'll be clutches in the jaws of death

1099
01:28:13,159 --> 01:28:13,710
What crap!

1100
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,500
As if his predictions
will come true!

1101
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,070
Who the hell is he?!

1102
01:28:17,070 --> 01:28:21,489
When the planets are not well aligned
his entry is a blessing in disguise

1103
01:28:21,489 --> 01:28:24,010
He'll predict second by second
within a second

1104
01:28:24,010 --> 01:28:27,670
In the 14th minute
you'll both go in search of him

1105
01:28:27,670 --> 01:28:31,869
In the game of cards, many
have lost even a kingdom

1106
01:28:31,869 --> 01:28:35,369
But your lucky hand
always reigns supreme

1107
01:28:35,369 --> 01:28:38,900
'Victory' is the name of my house

1108
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:43,940
You changed the name
of your house?

1109
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:48,659
Till yesterday
we also thought this

1110
01:28:48,659 --> 01:28:55,659
Then we met a man who
is the synonym for victory

1111
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:57,350
Where is he?

1112
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:59,780
He is the one
I just spoke about

1113
01:28:59,780 --> 01:29:00,860
Gopi
Gambler Gopi

1114
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:04,100
24 x 7 x 365
cards, clubs and casino!

1115
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:08,409
Your body guard look is good
Only thing missing are these glasses

1116
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,489
Place your cards

1117
01:29:09,489 --> 01:29:10,199
Already done

1118
01:29:10,199 --> 01:29:12,360
I didn't even see him deal

1119
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:15,190
Didn't I tell you
he is real fast?!

1120
01:29:15,190 --> 01:29:17,090
Damn all this danger!

1121
01:29:17,090 --> 01:29:24,090
As if danger will
fall down from the skies

1122
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:31,429
Light my cigarette

1123
01:29:31,429 --> 01:29:34,659
Glam dolls will disappear
Let us hurry back

1124
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:35,869
Oh my God!

1125
01:29:35,869 --> 01:29:36,670
What happened?

1126
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:37,480
Damn lucky

1127
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:39,780
You escaped this danger
by a hair's breadth!

1128
01:29:39,780 --> 01:29:40,210
Danger....?!

1129
01:29:40,210 --> 01:29:43,360
My target is actually
not numskulls like you

1130
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:47,619
To beat betting laureate, king
of gambling Suyodhana hollow

1131
01:29:47,619 --> 01:29:54,260
You are sitting right in front of your
opponent, your dream has come true

1132
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:59,000
What are you saying?
Oh my god! What an honor!

1133
01:29:59,000 --> 01:29:59,880
What a pleasure

1134
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:05,100
Right from childhood I've been dreaming
of taking a photo along with you, sir

1135
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:06,599
They are equally matched

1136
01:30:06,599 --> 01:30:08,469
- Smile please
- Thank you, sir

1137
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:10,080
This is enough
I've beaten you

1138
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,080
My life time ambition
has been fulfilled

1139
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:14,350
- I am going to retire
- Wait, my friend

1140
01:30:14,350 --> 01:30:19,969
In 14 days, there's a wedding in my family
You must stay with me as my guest

1141
01:30:19,969 --> 01:30:21,530
I must play with you and win

1142
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:23,420
I am Sathya Menon
My specialty is 'sweet balls'

1143
01:30:23,420 --> 01:30:24,900
May be he isn't
suffering from diabetes!

1144
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:25,320
Hmmmmmmm...mouth watering!

1145
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,600
Did you alone do all this?

1146
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:30,489
No, I have assistants to help me

1147
01:30:30,489 --> 01:30:32,369
Like it?

1148
01:30:32,369 --> 01:30:36,150
- Very much
- Thank you

1149
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:39,929
Sweet ball or she?]

1150
01:30:39,929 --> 01:30:43,710
I meant this 'laddu'

1151
01:30:43,710 --> 01:30:46,540
- All yours
- Coming?

1152
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:48,429
For what?

1153
01:30:48,429 --> 01:30:55,429
To make sweet balls
for their family wedding

1154
01:30:55,980 --> 01:30:58,820
Yeah, that's why

1155
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:02,679
I'll come, sir
Thank you

1156
01:31:02,679 --> 01:31:05,960
Astrologer sir, forgive us
for not taking you seriously

1157
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,320
We insulted you
very sorry

1158
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:15,320
Just like you said, we escaped
a huge danger by the skin of our teeth

1159
01:31:20,469 --> 01:31:22,960
If you come home
we'll treat you like God

1160
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,239
If you don't
we'll die at your feet

1161
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:32,280
I'll come and predict your planetary charts,
enhance the science of directions in your

1162
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:32,530
house

1163
01:31:32,530 --> 01:31:33,790
I'll protect you from death

1164
01:31:33,790 --> 01:31:36,130
If you gave birth tonus, father
he gave us a rebirth!

1165
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:38,600
He just now saved us
from a huge danger!

1166
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:39,429
Take his blessings

1167
01:31:39,429 --> 01:31:44,580
Catch me falling at his feet!
I don't need anyone's blessing

1168
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:48,889
This is a matter of life and
death for your children

1169
01:31:48,889 --> 01:31:53,310
When we need a life saver
in our card game...

1170
01:31:53,310 --> 01:31:58,179
...don't we use a trump card?

1171
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:05,179
If he is making such sweeping promises
let's see what he can deliver

1172
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:15,090
You've all gained foothold easily
How will I enter their space?

1173
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:22,739
Don't be in a hurry, Ajay

1174
01:32:22,739 --> 01:32:28,920
I've planned when and how
you should enter their house

1175
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:29,619
Be ready

1176
01:32:29,619 --> 01:32:36,619
He has been with me all the time
and is drooling over my fiancee!

1177
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:41,860
I can forgive anything
but back stabbing

1178
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:42,600
Get lost!

1179
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:42,969
Uncle

1180
01:32:42,969 --> 01:32:46,500
I know who they are
and their where abouts

1181
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:51,270
The people of pandavapuram
have sent het some where far away

1182
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:54,610
Even though we won
after 14 years...

1183
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:59,860
..We are not able to
taste the fruits of our victory

1184
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:04,100
I'll some how get them

1185
01:33:04,100 --> 01:33:08,260
I'll take leave now

1186
01:33:08,260 --> 01:33:14,489
'His name is Sheik Ali Masthan'

1187
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:21,489
'He treats and cures amnesic patients
with alternate medicine called Unani'

1188
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:32,920
Both you and I know
his predicament

1189
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:34,080
I know
What now?

1190
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,960
He has forgotten his entire past

1191
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:42,239
By my treatment at least
he has found his way here

1192
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:48,489
A capsule a month will make him
recollect and get back to normalcy

1193
01:33:48,489 --> 01:33:49,929
Yes...yes, it will

1194
01:33:49,929 --> 01:33:51,139
- Where is my capsule?
- Here you go

1195
01:33:51,139 --> 01:33:51,739
I'll go and bring back that girl

1196
01:33:51,739 --> 01:33:51,989
Take our folks in

1197
01:33:51,989 --> 01:33:52,969
Come in

1198
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:59,969
Supreme Absolute Truth!

1199
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:11,380
Why did you step back, Guruji?

1200
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:34,210
Praise be to the 9 planets

1201
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:43,300
There is an evil spirit
that's envelopiong this house

1202
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,600
What are you blabbering?

1203
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:50,969
When the divine mace is here
how can any spirit have evil effect?

1204
01:34:50,969 --> 01:34:54,389
That evil spirit has
dented your mace

1205
01:34:54,389 --> 01:34:56,000
Guna, get the mace

1206
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,889
Victory to Duryodhana

1207
01:34:57,889 --> 01:35:03,099
Praise be to the divine mace

1208
01:35:03,099 --> 01:35:08,310
True, there is a dent, father

1209
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:08,830
Let me see

1210
01:35:08,830 --> 01:35:11,710
Drive the spirit away before
our life gets dented, Guruji

1211
01:35:11,710 --> 01:35:15,780
I tried my best to convince her
but she isn't listening to me

1212
01:35:15,780 --> 01:35:18,909
Looks loke she'll only respond
to rough and tough handling

1213
01:35:18,909 --> 01:35:25,909
Don't worry, somehow I will manage to
bring her around before your wedding

1214
01:35:28,929 --> 01:35:35,929
Who are these people?
They look like a drama troupe

1215
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:38,239
How dare you
hit my aunt!

1216
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:42,790
He hit the evil spirit inside her
When did she come here to stay?

1217
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:43,469
14 years

1218
01:35:43,469 --> 01:35:45,369
How long since you lost
in your gambling game?

1219
01:35:45,369 --> 01:35:45,710
14 years!

1220
01:35:45,710 --> 01:35:50,750
How long since you were forced to
be bachelors like over grown okra?

1221
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:52,139
Same, guruji

1222
01:35:52,139 --> 01:35:55,610
Do you want evil spirit or
our Guruji's positive vibes?

1223
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:57,719
We need only Guruji here

1224
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:04,719
Then the sooner you send
your aunt away the better

1225
01:36:04,889 --> 01:36:11,580
Send her beyond
the outskirts of this village

1226
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,550
What's this injustice?

1227
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,210
Wait

1228
01:36:14,210 --> 01:36:14,869
What?

1229
01:36:14,869 --> 01:36:16,190
Uncle, keys

1230
01:36:16,190 --> 01:36:21,449
1st time she called
our father as 'uncle'

1231
01:36:21,449 --> 01:36:24,739
All grace of our Guruji

1232
01:36:24,739 --> 01:36:28,030
Praise be to Guruji Graharaj

1233
01:36:28,030 --> 01:36:31,980
Praise be to our dear Guruji

1234
01:36:31,980 --> 01:36:35,270
Vijju, what's all this drama?

1235
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:41,190
This is how the pandavas
stayed incognito for a year

1236
01:36:41,190 --> 01:36:45,760
We are doing this
for your sake now

1237
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:52,610
No one can come in between
you and me in this game!

1238
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:55,469
'His name is Pichakuntla pydlithali'

1239
01:36:55,469 --> 01:37:00,909
'He is very fond of Bapu's cartoons
and poems written by Cinare'

1240
01:37:00,909 --> 01:37:04,540
'So he fashioned a pen name
for himself as Bapure'

1241
01:37:04,540 --> 01:37:07,489
'He loves drinking coffee in the rain
and writes poetry in the moonlight'

1242
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:14,429
'His weakness is playing judas
and hence ruining many families'

1243
01:37:14,429 --> 01:37:21,429
'His wife ran miles away from him
without even waiting for a divorce'

1244
01:37:24,090 --> 01:37:27,480
'Totally he is a retard'

1245
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:31,719
I inhale and exhale Telugu

1246
01:37:31,719 --> 01:37:38,719
'Son of a mongrel! I will punch you
so hard, your ears will go (S)tone deaf!'

1247
01:37:53,630 --> 01:38:00,630
Aha! Even swear words in
Telugu are ambrosia to my ears!

1248
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:15,400
Telugu damsel! Come out and learn
traditions and Telugu customs

1249
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:32,040
Dad! Don't call me Kuchala kumari
How many times do I have to tell you?

1250
01:38:34,400 --> 01:38:35,389
Call me Kuku

1251
01:38:35,389 --> 01:38:39,690
That's why I've brought you
here to change your name

1252
01:38:39,690 --> 01:38:42,760
I can't carry this saree, daddy

1253
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:45,830
I want my shorts right now

1254
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:52,830
There are 3 bulls raging in this house
who are bachelors after losing a bet

1255
01:38:53,590 --> 01:38:56,489
You don't know how
they will react to you

1256
01:38:56,489 --> 01:38:57,730
You mean bulls, dad?

1257
01:38:57,730 --> 01:39:01,250
You and your accent!
Do what you want!

1258
01:39:01,250 --> 01:39:06,500
Guna, go to every house in Kauravapuram
and invite them for the wedding personally

1259
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07,300
Yes, father

1260
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:07,699
Brother-in-Law?

1261
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:08,500
Hello bro-in-law!

1262
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:10,690
Why are you showing up so late?

1263
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:13,420
I received the 1st invitation
The wedding will be a grand success

1264
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:14,840
What book are you writing now?

1265
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:17,030
I'm rejuvenating drops
that are fading out

1266
01:39:17,030 --> 01:39:19,650
Name of the book is
'Raindrops of Telugu'

1267
01:39:19,650 --> 01:39:21,639
He and his Telugu obsession

1268
01:39:21,639 --> 01:39:23,230
Where is your daughter?

1269
01:39:23,230 --> 01:39:26,810
My dear Kuchala kumari
Uncle wants to meet you

1270
01:39:26,810 --> 01:39:31,280
What is this dress?!
What happened to your sari?

1271
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,150
I did a strip tease
It was so hot

1272
01:39:32,150 --> 01:39:35,489
You mean slipped it bout with ease

1273
01:39:35,489 --> 01:39:40,260
How does her attire matter?
She is very attractive

1274
01:39:40,260 --> 01:39:46,619
She can marry my eldest son Guna
when my youngest gets married

1275
01:39:46,619 --> 01:39:48,099
Let me marry her, father?

1276
01:39:48,099 --> 01:39:49,909
Don't change your mind
I beg of you

1277
01:39:49,909 --> 01:39:52,960
When we were exchanging horoscope
the groom-to-be dies of epilepsy

1278
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:59,960
When she was about to get engaged
the groom died of a head injury

1279
01:40:01,179 --> 01:40:08,179
Choose either of them
for my daughter

1280
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:18,920
You'll be blessed if you agree

1281
01:40:24,889 --> 01:40:31,889
Either of them is fin-

1282
01:40:35,699 --> 01:40:42,699
Where did they go?

1283
01:40:44,349 --> 01:40:51,349
Bapure can't be bowled over!

1284
01:40:55,159 --> 01:41:02,159
What an ideal Telugu idol?!

1285
01:41:05,969 --> 01:41:11,080
Who is this respected soul?

1286
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,429
To save the family
from all hurdles

1287
01:41:13,429 --> 01:41:20,429
The astrology genius
and his assistant

1288
01:41:20,610 --> 01:41:24,619
Always be alert

1289
01:41:24,619 --> 01:41:27,300
Greetings, sir

1290
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,980
I'm Bapure

1291
01:41:29,980 --> 01:41:36,980
I heard you are an astrogy genius

1292
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:46,340
Which planets are
under your control?

1293
01:41:47,369 --> 01:41:54,369
What ancient Hindu texts
have you read?

1294
01:41:56,739 --> 01:42:03,739
What sacred texts
have you memorized?

1295
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:11,780
You want to know about
the scripures I've studied?

1296
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:17,830
Those who pass in 1st class...

1297
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:22,849
...become Govt officials,
engineers and doctors

1298
01:42:22,849 --> 01:42:25,469
Those who pass in 2nd calss..

1299
01:42:25,469 --> 01:42:31,020
...chose a career in managment or
business controling the 1st class people

1300
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:34,070
Those who pass in 3rd calss...

1301
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:38,389
...become politicians controling
ist and 2nd class sectors

1302
01:42:38,389 --> 01:42:45,389
Those who fail and don't feature in
any of these become thugs and dacoits

1303
01:42:47,010 --> 01:42:54,010
They control all 3 sections

1304
01:42:55,190 --> 01:43:02,190
The last group without any
qualifications are the seers and God men

1305
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:26,610
Whole world falls at the feet
of this 5th group

1306
01:43:31,489 --> 01:43:35,389
What knowledge
What enlightenment

1307
01:43:35,389 --> 01:43:41,250
No award can match your brilliance

1308
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:43,210
Let's go

1309
01:43:43,210 --> 01:43:48,170
To be on the safe side, ask our folks
to be on their guard with this fellow

1310
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:49,050
Okay, dad

1311
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:50,360
Nice chicken piece

1312
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:51,239
Sexy leg

1313
01:43:51,239 --> 01:43:53,000
Telugu dhai
Telugu eggplant

1314
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,190
Telugu tamarind rice
Telugu pickle

1315
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:58,719
Who is the angel
who cooked this feast?

1316
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,070
I am Sathya Menon

1317
01:44:01,070 --> 01:44:07,280
This feast was cooked by me
and my 2 assistants

1318
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:11,900
He is Mr Graharaju
and his assistant

1319
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:17,190
What a beautiful telugu name
right, Kuchala kumari?

1320
01:44:17,190 --> 01:44:19,880
Mr Genius, are you married?

1321
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,900
I'm a chaste bachelor

1322
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,920
Why this celibate status?

1323
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,170
It's the only way
to change this world

1324
01:44:28,170 --> 01:44:33,030
Once married, we can't even
change a TV channel!

1325
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:36,230
What does 'askjalita' mean, dad?

1326
01:44:36,230 --> 01:44:43,230
When desires of all kinds
rage from within our body...

1327
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:59,290
..to curb all worldly pleasures
and bring it under control

1328
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:07,349
Isn't he a great man?

1329
01:45:07,349 --> 01:45:11,530
Are you also 'askhalita'?

1330
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:18,530
Shut up! Don't make
an ass of yourself

1331
01:45:24,020 --> 01:45:25,840
I'm married

1332
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,489
Oh! Is that so?

1333
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:33,139
Who is your husband?

1334
01:45:33,139 --> 01:45:34,969
He is-

1335
01:45:34,969 --> 01:45:40,389
You said you are
a staunch bachelor?

1336
01:45:40,389 --> 01:45:44,969
I meant he is as tall as him

1337
01:45:44,969 --> 01:45:46,929
Tourist guide abroad

1338
01:45:46,929 --> 01:45:49,400
Oh! That's what you meant?

1339
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:50,369
Heard that, dear?

1340
01:45:50,369 --> 01:45:57,369
Though her husband is abroad
she is such an uncrushed flower!

1341
01:45:58,330 --> 01:46:05,330
This is the beauty of
our Indian restraint

1342
01:46:07,369 --> 01:46:14,369
But a non-Indian woman would
have been taken apart like this

1343
01:46:22,810 --> 01:46:25,780
What made you come
to that conclusion?

1344
01:46:25,780 --> 01:46:30,369
Who is this chap who looks like
a 6 footer even when he is seated?!

1345
01:46:30,369 --> 01:46:31,389
Gam-gambler Gopi

1346
01:46:31,389 --> 01:46:35,010
Are you that Gopi who made
my brother-in-law lose in cards?

1347
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:41,880
Then play a game
with me and try to win

1348
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:47,130
Whay are you
grabbing my finger?

1349
01:46:47,130 --> 01:46:54,130
He's implying your hand will
be left with 4 fingers only!

1350
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:03,560
What will happen to my 5th?

1351
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:07,889
Thank you, sir
You saved my finger

1352
01:47:07,889 --> 01:47:09,150
Bapure, don't get tensed

1353
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:11,179
Finish your 1 and 2 and come

1354
01:47:11,179 --> 01:47:12,920
What does 1 and 2 mean?

1355
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:14,699
And you call yourself a poet!

1356
01:47:14,699 --> 01:47:17,520
1 is to pee
2 is to crap

1357
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:20,730
Once ...just once
I have to beat him

1358
01:47:20,730 --> 01:47:25,110
You? I changed my number and
network and still you traced me!

1359
01:47:25,110 --> 01:47:26,699
Where are you, loony female?

1360
01:47:26,699 --> 01:47:27,659
You are here...where?

1361
01:47:27,659 --> 01:47:27,979
Dammit!

1362
01:47:27,979 --> 01:47:29,250
- Who, friend?
- My fiancee

1363
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:33,699
Why did you yell at her then?

1364
01:47:33,699 --> 01:47:40,699
She is tsunami
draped in a sari

1365
01:47:41,400 --> 01:47:48,400
She stuck on to me right from
when she was a year old

1366
01:48:05,699 --> 01:48:07,909
She's still holding me tight

1367
01:48:07,909 --> 01:48:10,550
How old is that tsunami beauty?

1368
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,760
What a charming beauty!

1369
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:17,179
She has Telugu filled
into every pore of her body

1370
01:48:17,179 --> 01:48:20,599
No! She looks like a fighting fowl
ready for the game

1371
01:48:20,599 --> 01:48:23,489
I feel like
making her mine

1372
01:48:23,489 --> 01:48:28,500
She looks strong and sturdy like
a rain drenched cement bag

1373
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:31,239
If you see a girl
you get all hot bothered

1374
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:31,580
Dumbass

1375
01:48:31,580 --> 01:48:37,510
Why did you come
'when I told you not to'?

1376
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:44,510
My love for you is increasing
like our world bank debt

1377
01:48:45,590 --> 01:48:50,440
Your love for me is declining
like the value of our rupee

1378
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:52,380
I can'tlive without you, dear

1379
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:53,400
Don't touch me

1380
01:48:53,400 --> 01:49:00,400
Sorry, I touched you by mistake

1381
01:49:03,730 --> 01:49:05,860
I cannot live
without my darling

1382
01:49:05,860 --> 01:49:07,340
I am going to die

1383
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:10,550
Don't go any where
I'll make him change his mind

1384
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:12,800
Friend, your fiancee
will stay with us

1385
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:15,690
Take her inside and
show her to her room

1386
01:49:15,690 --> 01:49:21,290
Why another room?
She can stay with my daughter

1387
01:49:21,290 --> 01:49:24,460
Comem, sweet heart

1388
01:49:24,460 --> 01:49:26,579
Please go

1389
01:49:26,579 --> 01:49:30,690
You are like a full frown tree
liberally fertilized

1390
01:49:30,690 --> 01:49:32,750
Uncle, who is this?

1391
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,290
Why get irritated?

1392
01:49:34,290 --> 01:49:36,869
She is gambler Gopi's fiancee

1393
01:49:36,869 --> 01:49:37,380
Greetings

1394
01:49:37,380 --> 01:49:38,409
Kuchala kumari

1395
01:49:38,409 --> 01:49:41,159
This wonderful lady will be
sharing your room

1396
01:49:41,159 --> 01:49:42,560
She's just like vanilla ice cream

1397
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:44,130
You look awesome too

1398
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:46,090
- Nice dress
- Thank you

1399
01:49:46,090 --> 01:49:48,540
Take this Telugu lady inside

1400
01:49:48,540 --> 01:49:49,520
Bapure, he-

1401
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,000
HE?!

1402
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,550
I mean she should not share
a room with your daughter

1403
01:49:54,550 --> 01:49:58,869
Each of you give me
a string of dos and dont's

1404
01:49:58,869 --> 01:50:01,570
Shut up! You and
your vowel language!

1405
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:07,739
She crosses her leg on to
the person sleeping next to her

1406
01:50:07,739 --> 01:50:08,440
So what?

1407
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:11,969
Both are woman, let them
cross legs on each other

1408
01:50:11,969 --> 01:50:13,030
What is wrong?

1409
01:50:13,030 --> 01:50:13,730
Bapure, listen-

1410
01:50:13,730 --> 01:50:14,790
Stop your advice

1411
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:16,199
Come with me, dear

1412
01:50:16,199 --> 01:50:16,550
Bapure...Bapure!

1413
01:50:16,550 --> 01:50:19,020
What is this speed breaker saying now?

1414
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:21,150
2 swords can't be in sheath

1415
01:50:21,150 --> 01:50:23,280
He's butting in!

1416
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:28,260
2 females heads
can't share a bed

1417
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:29,679
Listen to-

1418
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:33,940
Note down his
pearls of wisdom

1419
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:40,940
Nowadays isn't 1 phone
used with 2 sim cards, no?

1420
01:50:41,050 --> 01:50:44,610
Everyone has some
dumb suggestion...go

1421
01:50:44,610 --> 01:50:48,880
Your daughter's life
shouldn't get ruined

1422
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:49,860

"Vermilion grants longevity to
a woman and her spouse always"

1426
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:25,360
"To be kissed , invite
cheeks milky white"

1427
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:33,440
- I can't
- Continue

1428
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:40,440
Is he torturing us
to gape at that girl?

1429
01:51:47,130 --> 01:51:54,130
Rice flour pattern with dots
you drew was awesome

1430
01:52:00,829 --> 01:52:03,869
Thank you

1431
01:52:03,869 --> 01:52:10,869
Your muscles
are also awesome

1432
01:52:11,480 --> 01:52:18,079
Look how she follows
our Telugu customs!

1433
01:52:18,079 --> 01:52:22,369
See with what devotion
she has drawn that pattern

1434
01:52:22,369 --> 01:52:26,690
Why is she circling
that pillar, dad?

1435
01:52:26,690 --> 01:52:28,579
That's our fortified
sacred plant basil?

1436
01:52:28,579 --> 01:52:28,860
Fort?

1437
01:52:28,860 --> 01:52:30,280
My fate!
I deserve this

1438
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:30,849
Go inside

1439
01:52:30,849 --> 01:52:31,130

1440
01:52:31,130 --> 01:52:31,980
Learn Telugu cilture

1441
01:52:31,980 --> 01:52:33,119
What's special about today?

1442
01:52:33,119 --> 01:52:35,389
Today is Thursday, right?
special significance for women

1443
01:52:35,389 --> 01:52:36,810
But today is Friday

1444
01:52:36,810 --> 01:52:39,860
Friday is dedicated
to Goddess of wealth

1445
01:52:39,860 --> 01:52:42,480
That's why
I follow this ritual

1446
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,900
I'm very happy
to hear this

1447
01:52:44,900 --> 01:52:50,170
Instead of a bath tub, ensure
she takes an 'abhyanga' bath

1448
01:52:50,170 --> 01:52:52,090
What is 'abhyanga' dad?

1449
01:52:52,090 --> 01:52:53,530
Height of ignorance!

1450
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:58,239
Applying turmeric paste all over
the body and taking a shower

1451
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:03,280
Wow! Sounds intersring

1452
01:53:03,280 --> 01:53:10,280
Will you show me how?

1453
01:53:11,690 --> 01:53:16,630
What a sweet heart!

1454
01:53:16,630 --> 01:53:23,630
Take her in and give her
a herbal ayurvedic bath

1455
01:53:23,739 --> 01:53:26,329
What is he blabbering?

1456
01:53:26,329 --> 01:53:32,840
Actually it is not safe to
send them both in

1457
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:38,040
The other day you objected
to them sharing a room

1458
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:40,270
Today it is the bath room!

1459
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:42,670
Tell me what is bugging you

1460
01:53:42,670 --> 01:53:44,590
Bapure sir, you don't understand

1461
01:53:44,590 --> 01:53:46,650
If you melt a gold chain
you'll get gold out of it

1462
01:53:46,650 --> 01:53:49,699
If you melt a cycle chain
can you get a cycle?

1463
01:53:49,699 --> 01:53:53,510
- If you melt a gold chain-
- Gold

1464
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:57,579
- If you melt a cycle chain-
- cycle

1465
01:53:57,579 --> 01:53:59,590
I'll clobber you

1466
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:02,940
My daughter
My wish...get lost!

1467
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:09,940
Is this enough or do you
need anything else?

1468
01:54:10,670 --> 01:54:12,050
This will do

1469
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:14,130
Shall we start?

1470
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:16,199
Mohini, what happened?

1471
01:54:16,199 --> 01:54:23,199
"Hi Telugu missy, your lips rosy
Your soft cheeks I saw closely"

1472
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:31,510
"Your petite feet anointed with turmeric
Fulsome breasts make me euphoric"

1473
01:54:32,130 --> 01:54:38,079
"I saw intently, I saw intensely
I saw every mole in your body"

1474
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:43,510
"I wrote down, I willed it to you
my heart forever so true"

1475
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:49,810
"I looked into your eyes, lightning
My senses reeled, enlightening"

1476
01:54:49,810 --> 01:54:56,810
"Your spine made heat climb up with in me
Your curves halted Time's hands willfully"

1477
01:54:59,250 --> 01:55:06,250
"I saw sea's depth and peak's height
What I saw made my body react right"

1478
01:55:08,690 --> 01:55:13,960
"Girls, curves, valleys and plateau
I saw up, down, highs and lows"

1479
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:18,199
"Girls, curves, valleys and plateaue
I saw up, down, highs and lows"

1480
01:55:18,199 --> 01:55:22,790
"I saw freely, I saw fully
I saw every pore in your body"

1481
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:29,790
'I jotted it down, I noted it too
my soul I saved just for you"

1482
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:36,020
"Like being entrapped in a quagmire
is your navel; quicksand of desire"

1483
01:55:36,020 --> 01:55:40,579
"Sway of your hips that dip and dive
I saw; breathless, I could barely survive"

1484
01:55:40,579 --> 01:55:47,469
"Wow! I saw parts of you, crystal clear
where rays of sun and moon can't enter"

1485
01:55:47,469 --> 01:55:53,070
"Yahoo! Even places you haven't seen
I saw and everything else in between"

1486
01:55:53,070 --> 01:55:58,670
"I saw intently, I saw intensely
I saw every part of your body"

1487
01:55:58,670 --> 01:56:04,429
"I wrote down, I willed it to you
my heart forever so true"

1488
01:56:04,429 --> 01:56:09,469
"Hi Telugu missy, your lips rosy
Your soft cheeks I saw closely"

1489
01:56:09,469 --> 01:56:14,079
"Your petite feet anointed with turmeric
Fulsome breasts make me euphoric"

1490
01:56:14,079 --> 01:56:19,369
"I saw intently, I saw intensely
I saw every mole in your body"

1491
01:56:19,369 --> 01:56:26,369
"I wrote down, I willed it to you
my heart forever so true"

1492
01:56:26,889 --> 01:56:33,159
"I saw intently, I saw intensely
I saw every part of your body"

1493
01:56:33,159 --> 01:56:34,610
Enough of seeing

1494
01:56:34,610 --> 01:56:35,570
- Come
- Where

1495
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:37,020
Come over there

1496
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:44,020
What's the purpose of our visit
and what are you up to?

1497
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:48,510
You made him
dress up like a girl

1498
01:56:48,510 --> 01:56:51,550
But you didn't brief him, dad

1499
01:56:51,550 --> 01:56:52,150
Understood?

1500
01:56:52,150 --> 01:56:57,060
Each of you should do justice
to your respective roles

1501
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:58,619
Best of luck

1502
01:56:58,619 --> 01:56:59,130
Brother-in-law

1503
01:56:59,130 --> 01:57:02,770
Bapure uncle is coming
Hide...let's all hide

1504
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:04,329
Whi is there?

1505
01:57:04,329 --> 01:57:06,400
Someone is here,
brother-in-law

1506
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:07,960
Where are you?

1507
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:10,550
I can't see anyone here

1508
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:11,070
Brother-in-law!

1509
01:57:11,070 --> 01:57:12,630
What happened, Bapure?

1510
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:14,190
- Brother-in-law!
- What happened?

1511
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:17,780
Why are you shouting
like a poossessed dog?

1512
01:57:17,780 --> 01:57:21,250
Someone was hanging
around here, I looked

1513
01:57:21,250 --> 01:57:23,719
But I didn't see anyone

1514
01:57:23,719 --> 01:57:25,210
Go and search

1515
01:57:25,210 --> 01:57:25,710
Search

1516
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:26,699
Look everywhere

1517
01:57:26,699 --> 01:57:28,679
Search that side also

1518
01:57:28,679 --> 01:57:30,170
Who is there?

1519
01:57:30,170 --> 01:57:32,560
One of you, go and check

1520
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:34,880
Look behind
those gunny bags

1521
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:36,730
No one is there

1522
01:57:36,730 --> 01:57:38,119
Didn't see anyone

1523
01:57:38,119 --> 01:57:39,510
No one around

1524
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:39,969
Jackass!

1525
01:57:39,969 --> 01:57:41,829
He spoilt our sleep

1526
01:57:41,829 --> 01:57:45,550
If he continues to
show this loony side...

1527
01:57:45,550 --> 01:57:50,639
...bury him in our quarry

1528
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:57,639
I didn't get this at all
But something is fishy

1529
01:58:01,130 --> 01:58:04,030
You didn't let us
sleep last night

1530
01:58:04,030 --> 01:58:08,730
There is some conspiracy
brewing in this house

1531
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:15,730
Before I leave this house
I'll get to the bottom of this

1532
01:58:18,060 --> 01:58:22,770
Bro, this crazy cuckoo
should be tackled

1533
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:28,150
His planets are non aligned
and unfavorable now

1534
01:58:28,150 --> 01:58:33,540
Time for our astrology
genius to step in

1535
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:36,230
His treatment
starts tomorrow

1536
01:58:36,230 --> 01:58:40,260
I circumambulated
the temple 400 times

1537
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:47,260
Not only that, Guruji, we rolled over
all around the temple in our briefs!

1538
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:50,909
Bapure, what happened?

1539
01:58:50,909 --> 01:58:56,310
How can door frame
at 7' height hit my head?

1540
01:58:56,310 --> 01:59:01,599
It's death hell bent
on a fast to target you

1541
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:05,540
I've hedard of ministers go on
a fast to acheive their goal

1542
01:59:05,540 --> 01:59:07,190
But how can death fast?

1543
01:59:07,190 --> 01:59:13,349
During the time of destruction
we go against our intelligence

1544
01:59:13,349 --> 01:59:16,940
Your bad time has started

1545
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:23,940
Death God has been shoved from
the 1st house to the 8th house

1546
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:29,860
Shoved curses or
showed blessings?

1547
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:35,469
All jobless people are dying to step
into my space with pearls of wisdom!

1548
01:59:35,469 --> 01:59:37,619
That's no big deal
Try getting a paunch like this

1549
01:59:37,619 --> 01:59:38,270
What happened, Bapure?

1550
01:59:38,270 --> 01:59:39,130
My nose got broken

1551
01:59:39,130 --> 01:59:39,500
Get up

1552
01:59:39,500 --> 01:59:46,500
Has your bad time started?

1553
01:59:49,900 --> 01:59:56,900
200 kilos! Hit and miss
You just escaped your grave

1554
02:00:03,340 --> 02:00:10,340
Morning was the door jamb
Now this weight's hit and miss

1555
02:00:11,449 --> 02:00:18,449
'It is death hell bent
on a fast to target you'

1556
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:19,840
Genius...my savior!

1557
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,739
Forgive my stupidity

1558
02:00:21,739 --> 02:00:23,639
What happened, Bapure?

1559
02:00:23,639 --> 02:00:29,989
Just as you said, death seems
to be hungering after me

1560
02:00:29,989 --> 02:00:36,989
It is trying to eat me up
like a chicken biriyani

1561
02:00:39,329 --> 02:00:46,329
Now do you
believe our Guruji?

1562
02:00:47,060 --> 02:00:48,530
Yes, I do

1563
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:54,519
What do you think were
the demands of death?

1564
02:00:54,519 --> 02:00:55,849
- Assistant
- Understood

1565
02:00:55,849 --> 02:01:01,179
What did you say?
What did he understand?

1566
02:01:01,179 --> 02:01:03,840
What will happen now?

1567
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,829
Close your eyes

1568
02:01:05,829 --> 02:01:06,570
I did

1569
02:01:06,570 --> 02:01:06,840
What's this, Guruji?

1570
02:01:06,840 --> 02:01:07,610
It's the light of truth

1571
02:01:07,610 --> 02:01:09,310
Perform Vedic rites in Kasi
for our ancestors-

1572
02:01:09,310 --> 02:01:12,150
We will find peace of mind

1573
02:01:12,150 --> 02:01:14,230
If you don't want to die...

1574
02:01:14,230 --> 02:01:15,520
...if you confess
in front if this light-

1575
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,670
Death will be appeased

1576
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:23,320
Whom do you like very much?

1577
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:24,409
Sunny Leone

1578
02:01:24,409 --> 02:01:26,050
It's a lie

1579
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:26,599
Telugu

1580
02:01:26,599 --> 02:01:32,280
It should be a secret
you haven't told anyone

1581
02:01:32,280 --> 02:01:36,750
I got it now
I'll try again

1582
02:01:36,750 --> 02:01:38,050
Telling tales

1583
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:45,050
If you want your soul to
rest in peace when you die...

1584
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:57,000
...you must stop telling tales

1585
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:02,380
Till my dying day, huh?

1586
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:06,679
14 days,
14 hours...

1587
02:02:06,679 --> 02:02:10,969
14 minutes,
14 seconds...

1588
02:02:10,969 --> 02:02:16,349
...you must not tell tales

1589
02:02:16,349 --> 02:02:23,349
If I don't back stab
my stomach blows up

1590
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:33,020
So tell me how to
take out this gas

1591
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:39,219
I'll suggest the best remedy

1592
02:02:39,219 --> 02:02:42,139
What is it?

1593
02:02:42,139 --> 02:02:45,880
Sit ao a stove and
it will get equalized

1594
02:02:45,880 --> 02:02:47,739
An officer is questioning
in our quarry for paperwork

1595
02:02:47,739 --> 02:02:50,540
Did you tell the quarry
belongs to Suyodhana?

1596
02:02:50,540 --> 02:02:53,030
Our words fell on deaf ears

1597
02:02:53,030 --> 02:03:00,030
Tell me net time
We'll finish him off

1598
02:03:08,869 --> 02:03:15,869
Ajay, this is the right time for you
to lure Gaja to our advantage

1599
02:03:44,650 --> 02:03:48,770
Take this hot coffee and
stimulate heat inside him

1600
02:03:48,770 --> 02:03:51,449
An hour before the wedding
ensure Gaja is with you

1601
02:03:51,449 --> 02:03:58,449
I'll handle
rest of
the story

1602
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:02,059
Coffee

1603
02:04:02,059 --> 02:04:06,619
Why did you bring it?

1604
02:04:06,619 --> 02:04:13,619
No one is at home
So I brought it for you

1605
02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:24,510
Okay, keep it on the table

1606
02:04:24,829 --> 02:04:31,540
'What to do now?'

1607
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:38,250
Lizard...I'm terrified of Lizard

1608
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:41,610
Hey Gaja!

1609
02:04:41,610 --> 02:04:48,610
Mohini is petrified of lizards

1610
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:56,710
No coffee for me?

1611
02:04:56,710 --> 02:05:03,500
I'll get it for you

1612
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:05,090
Oh! My goddamn fate

1613
02:05:05,090 --> 02:05:06,690
Mohini, keep it there

1614
02:05:06,690 --> 02:05:07,090
Lizard...?

1615
02:05:07,090 --> 02:05:07,480
Huh?

1616
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:10,949
Aren't you terrified of lizards?

1617
02:05:10,949 --> 02:05:15,999
Oh! I'm petrified of lizards

1618
02:05:15,999 --> 02:05:18,659
- Gana!
- What lousy timinh!!

1619
02:05:18,659 --> 02:05:22,760
Thank God he didn't ask

1620
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:26,040
No coffee for me?

1621
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:28,460
I'll get it for you

1622
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:28,989
Coffee

1623
02:05:28,989 --> 02:05:32,179
You brought it?
Thank you, Mohoni

1624
02:05:32,179 --> 02:05:35,369
awwwww! Lizard
I'm petrified of lizards

1625
02:05:35,369 --> 02:05:35,900
No...don't

1626
02:05:35,900 --> 02:05:38,550
What a bear-hug this is!

1627
02:05:38,550 --> 02:05:43,349
Gawd! These guys have
changed me into a female

1628
02:05:43,349 --> 02:05:45,889
This stupid nail

1629
02:05:45,889 --> 02:05:52,889
Ajay, our plans
will get ruined

1630
02:05:53,530 --> 02:05:57,059
I can't go on like this

1631
02:05:57,059 --> 02:06:04,059
You asked me to lure 1 chap
2 more drooled and groped me

1632
02:06:05,889 --> 02:06:10,389
I can't take this sandwich massage
stuck between these brothers, dad

1633
02:06:10,389 --> 02:06:12,670
Don't be in a hurry

1634
02:06:12,670 --> 02:06:18,929
Kichaka's chapter
of Mahabharath has begun

1635
02:06:18,929 --> 02:06:23,099
What are you saying?

1636
02:06:23,099 --> 02:06:30,099
Kichaka was 1 villian in
Viratta chapter of Mahabharath

1637
02:06:32,469 --> 02:06:39,469
There are 3 'Kichakas' here

1638
02:06:40,520 --> 02:06:47,520
3 birds at 1 shot

1639
02:06:48,559 --> 02:06:53,380
Handle 3...I can't

1640
02:06:53,380 --> 02:07:00,380
My dearest bro?
My precious pet!

1641
02:07:03,030 --> 02:07:07,880
Not even a milk white beauty!

1642
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:08,369
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!

1643
02:07:08,369 --> 02:07:09,829
Kuchala kumara...what happened?

1644
02:07:09,829 --> 02:07:10,809
what happened?

1645
02:07:10,809 --> 02:07:11,300
Lizard!!

1646
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:16,900
Are you also
scared of lizards?

1647
02:07:16,900 --> 02:07:20,579
Go...go...out you go

1648
02:07:20,579 --> 02:07:27,579
What happened to
you dear?

1649
02:07:33,329 --> 02:07:40,329
She got terrified of a lizard?

1650
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:54,219
Why did you come here?

1651
02:07:54,219 --> 02:07:59,800
What brought you here?

1652
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:06,800
My daughter screamed

1653
02:08:12,179 --> 02:08:19,179
Same reason we are here

1654
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:39,820
How could you be
scared of a lizard?

1655
02:08:48,500 --> 02:08:51,020
Come, brother-in-law

1656
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:58,020
Uncle, when you get
back from the garden...

1657
02:08:59,119 --> 02:09:06,119
...will you get me
a dozen huge oranges?

1658
02:09:09,949 --> 02:09:10,479
100%

1659
02:09:10,479 --> 02:09:13,969
- Do you also want?
- She won't need them

1660
02:09:13,969 --> 02:09:14,920
Oh! So you both will share?

1661
02:09:14,920 --> 02:09:16,650
I'll keep 2 and
give her the rest

1662
02:09:16,650 --> 02:09:19,270
What a sweet girl!
I'll glady get them for you

1663
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:20,489
Come along with me

1664
02:09:20,489 --> 02:09:21,420
Thank you, Kuku

1665
02:09:21,420 --> 02:09:22,030
It's okay

1666
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:23,260
For understanding our problem

1667
02:09:23,260 --> 02:09:24,489
I'm sorry for all this

1668
02:09:24,489 --> 02:09:25,650
Mother Gandhari

1669
02:09:25,650 --> 02:09:29,239
Open your eyes to see
our daughter-in-law

1670
02:09:29,239 --> 02:09:32,050
'When she is blindfolded
how can she see?'

1671
02:09:32,050 --> 02:09:32,369
'Numbskull!'

1672
02:09:32,369 --> 02:09:33,639
Dad, is she Gandhari?

1673
02:09:33,639 --> 02:09:35,750
She looks like
the statue of justice

1674
02:09:35,750 --> 02:09:37,920
She is their great, great,
great, great grandmother

1675
02:09:37,920 --> 02:09:39,010
When she was alive...

1676
02:09:39,010 --> 02:09:41,179
...they didn't perform
the much needed eye surgery

1677
02:09:41,179 --> 02:09:44,969
When she died they consecrated
a shrine for her and blind folded her

1678
02:09:44,969 --> 02:09:47,309
Don't give me
that innocent look!

1679
02:09:47,309 --> 02:09:49,659
No..astrololger sir,
what are you saying?

1680
02:09:49,659 --> 02:09:51,530
Won't I be blessed
by holy matrimony

1681
02:09:51,530 --> 02:09:53,829
Not me, that's what
the planets predict!

1682
02:09:53,829 --> 02:09:56,440
You said it right
I appreciate you

1683
02:09:56,440 --> 02:10:00,079
I've been telling her-

1684
02:10:00,079 --> 02:10:03,219
Won't I marry him
in this birth?

1685
02:10:03,219 --> 02:10:09,099
Will I not have the pleasure
of a wedding night with him?

1686
02:10:09,099 --> 02:10:10,610
Dear...relax
You have both

1687
02:10:10,610 --> 02:10:11,020
With whom?

1688
02:10:11,020 --> 02:10:13,070
Praise be to Lord Shiva

1689
02:10:13,070 --> 02:10:17,599
Planets says you'll be the daughter-in-law
of a house where 3 brothers reside

1690
02:10:17,599 --> 02:10:18,630
I'll marry 3 men?!

1691
02:10:18,630 --> 02:10:19,790
No, 1 of them

1692
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:21,570
That will be me

1693
02:10:21,570 --> 02:10:28,570
I've completed the prayer
Let's start the next ritual

1694
02:10:28,770 --> 02:10:32,969
Mother Gandhari's star Moola

1695
02:10:32,969 --> 02:10:39,969
Will one of you who shares
the same star come forward now?

1696
02:10:44,449 --> 02:10:51,139
I'm right in front of you
Tell me what I should do

1697
02:10:51,139 --> 02:10:53,480
'God knows what
I should do'

1698
02:10:53,480 --> 02:10:57,300
'Whatever the priest tells me
I guess I have to do'

1699
02:10:57,300 --> 02:11:01,000
According to your family lineage
since he shares the same star...

1700
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:05,010
...if you whisper your wishes
into his ears, Mother will fulfill them

1701
02:11:05,010 --> 02:11:07,540
You will be our
first daughter-in-law

1702
02:11:07,540 --> 02:11:11,599
So you get
the inaugural honor

1703
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:18,599
Mother Gandhari, stop this wedding
and ensure I marry the ine I love

1704
02:11:19,559 --> 02:11:23,420
'Stop this wedding?
She loves someone else?!'

1705
02:11:23,420 --> 02:11:26,570
You are my guest
You get preference

1706
02:11:26,570 --> 02:11:29,790
Honey should marry
the one she loves

1707
02:11:29,790 --> 02:11:36,790
'How does he know
Honey loves someone else?'

1708
02:11:47,150 --> 02:11:54,150
Thank you, my friend

1709
02:12:00,349 --> 02:12:03,920
The girl from Pandavapuram
should marry into our family

1710
02:12:03,920 --> 02:12:09,119
'How will it happen? She seems
to be in love with someone else!'

1711
02:12:09,119 --> 02:12:15,760
I should make out with Mohini and
she shlould satisfy all my desires

1712
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:17,980
She should become mine

1713
02:12:17,980 --> 02:12:19,639
'You lady killer!'

1714
02:12:19,639 --> 02:12:23,510
'Why obsess over
another man's girl friend?'

1715
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:30,510
I know what my brother
would have told you

1716
02:12:31,270 --> 02:12:34,949
He should not attain Mohini
come what may

1717
02:12:34,949 --> 02:12:36,790
He should get paralyzed

1718
02:12:36,790 --> 02:12:41,360
She should sit on my lap
in total surrender

1719
02:12:41,360 --> 02:12:48,360
'Is she a Giant wheel
for each of you to take a ride?'

1720
02:12:53,130 --> 02:13:00,040
- I'm Mohini
- You want to wish too?

1721
02:13:00,040 --> 02:13:02,329
please bless me such that
Kuchala lumari is...

1722
02:13:02,329 --> 02:13:03,610
...mother to my children

1723
02:13:03,610 --> 02:13:08,690
'Did I hear you right?
Wicked woman!'

1724
02:13:08,690 --> 02:13:12,449
'Why did I even volunteer
disclosing my time of birth?!'

1725
02:13:12,449 --> 02:13:15,030
- Mother, I am Kuku
- What do you want?

1726
02:13:15,030 --> 02:13:21,139
My dad being obsessed with Telugu
wants to arrange an alliance for me

1727
02:13:21,139 --> 02:13:25,780
But I am in Love, I want
to marry the one I love

1728
02:13:25,780 --> 02:13:26,710
Oh gawd!

1729
02:13:26,710 --> 02:13:27,179
Next...come

1730
02:13:27,179 --> 02:13:28,579
Victory to Mother

1731
02:13:28,579 --> 02:13:29,510
Okay, tell

1732
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:34,829
My life has become
like a dried fish

1733
02:13:34,829 --> 02:13:37,650
I tasted Sathya's culinary skill

1734
02:13:37,650 --> 02:13:44,650
just 1 night my taste buds want
a chance to taste her too, please

1735
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:59,780
'What distasteful desires at his age!'

1736
02:14:02,969 --> 02:14:06,369
Hey bro-in-law

1737
02:14:06,369 --> 02:14:13,369
My previous wish was for
Mother Gandhari to fulfill

1738
02:14:21,650 --> 02:14:27,840
Listen to my wish
meant for you

1739
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:34,840
If you whisper a word to anyone
what i whispered in your ears now...

1740
02:14:47,800 --> 02:14:54,110
...you'll be a skeleton in my quarry

1741
02:14:54,110 --> 02:14:59,199
Victory to Mother!

1742
02:14:59,199 --> 02:15:03,020
You son of an indecent lineage!

1743
02:15:03,020 --> 02:15:05,290
Victory to Mother!

1744
02:15:05,290 --> 02:15:09,820
Each heart desires
such dreadful wishes?!

1745
02:15:09,820 --> 02:15:16,790
If I tell I'll be buried alive
If I don't I'll burst like a bomb

1746
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:19,329
I have no other option
but to choose this

1747
02:15:19,329 --> 02:15:21,760
This is the last capsule
in my treatment for you

1748
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:23,440
After you swallow this...

1749
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:25,300
...you'll even remember
your previous birth

1750
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:26,230
Open your mouth

1751
02:15:26,230 --> 02:15:26,849
'You come'

1752
02:15:26,849 --> 02:15:28,090
I remember everything now

1753
02:15:28,090 --> 02:15:30,059
Those whom Honey
befriended in Bangkok

1754
02:15:30,059 --> 02:15:34,070
....are the ones who dented my head!

1755
02:15:34,070 --> 02:15:37,290
Praise be to Allah!
How gracious is Your mercy

1756
02:15:37,290 --> 02:15:42,469
He has got back his memory
I get richer by 500000!

1757
02:15:42,469 --> 02:15:48,020
You stay right here
I'll bring Suyodhana

1758
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:54,630
Are you trying to get your
quarry which we possess...

1759
02:15:54,630 --> 02:15:59,010
...in a legal mess in the court?

1760
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:00,369
No...leave me

1761
02:16:00,369 --> 02:16:03,079
Not just your quarry

1762
02:16:03,079 --> 02:16:07,820
We hold possession
of all quarries here

1763
02:16:07,820 --> 02:16:12,559
Bury him alive
in his own quarry!

1764
02:16:12,559 --> 02:16:19,329
For such a trival issue
if he reacts like this...

1765
02:16:19,329 --> 02:16:26,099
...imagine how he'll go
overboard if he learns about us

1766
02:16:26,099 --> 02:16:31,520
Your nephew has got back
his lost memory

1767
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:37,620
He was hit by men
from Bangkok it seems

1768
02:16:37,620 --> 02:16:41,660
He wants to meet you
So he can update you

1769
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:41,910
Come, sir

1770
02:16:41,900 --> 02:16:42,150
Look here

1771
02:16:42,130 --> 02:16:43,970
You take a look at
what you want us to see!

1772
02:16:43,970 --> 02:16:45,590
This quack doctor is forcing
to tell stuff I don't even remember

1773
02:16:45,590 --> 02:16:50,500
Unable to bear his torture of
swallowing capsule after capsule...

1774
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:53,450
...I'm running away from this village

1775
02:16:53,450 --> 02:16:54,430
That's all...Siddha

1776
02:16:54,430 --> 02:16:57,260
Are you trying to play stupid
games with me, Masthan?

1777
02:16:57,260 --> 02:16:58,560
This is all lies

1778
02:16:58,560 --> 02:16:59,300
Trust me

1779
02:16:59,300 --> 02:17:01,540
My treatment
won't let me down

1780
02:17:01,540 --> 02:17:03,770
Make him swallow
his own capsules

1781
02:17:03,770 --> 02:17:07,490
No, sir, if I do,
I'll forget m past life!

1782
02:17:07,490 --> 02:17:08,610
Allah! Save me

1783
02:17:08,610 --> 02:17:09,720
What happened, friend?

1784
02:17:09,720 --> 02:17:12,840
We employed him to
recover memory loss

1785
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:16,300
And he is making us go bonkers!

1786
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,130
What do we now?

1787
02:17:17,130 --> 02:17:20,020
Do you want to come down?

1788
02:17:20,020 --> 02:17:24,490
Only 2 more days
for the wedding

1789
02:17:24,490 --> 02:17:26,500
Hide him till then

1790
02:17:26,500 --> 02:17:31,170
Don't get tensed
We are all here for you

1791
02:17:31,170 --> 02:17:35,740
Generally lovers will be
protected by their love

1792
02:17:35,740 --> 02:17:42,610
But for our love, our family
is the protection shield

1793
02:17:42,610 --> 02:17:48,160
We will be married
in the next 2 days

1794
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:54,660
Oh gawd! So Honey loves
gambler Gopi, huh?

1795
02:17:54,660 --> 02:17:59,960
Where are you taking me?

1796
02:17:59,960 --> 02:18:06,960
Shhh! Look over there

1797
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:12,660
I will ki-

1798
02:18:12,660 --> 02:18:19,660
What are they up to?

1799
02:18:21,740 --> 02:18:27,180
Don't do anything

1800
02:18:27,180 --> 02:18:29,160
I'll tell my father

1801
02:18:29,160 --> 02:18:32,190
You know what he'll say?

1802
02:18:32,190 --> 02:18:32,930
What?

1803
02:18:32,930 --> 02:18:39,930
Gaja, don't think I'm getting you
married to Honey out of affection

1804
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:47,080
It is to avenge a revenge
of the Oandavapuram family

1805
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:54,080
You must marry Honey, whomever
she may have had a fling with

1806
02:18:55,600 --> 02:19:01,500
And whatever the consequences

1807
02:19:01,500 --> 02:19:02,980
Father?

1808
02:19:02,980 --> 02:19:09,980
Do you know?
Life is like an icecream

1809
02:19:14,770 --> 02:19:21,700
If you taste ity melts
If you waste also, it melts

1810
02:19:21,700 --> 02:19:25,510
'But it won't melt
if stored in the fridge!'

1811
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:28,350
Why do you think of
the one who rejects you...

1812
02:19:28,350 --> 02:19:30,520
....instead of the one
who loves you?

1813
02:19:30,520 --> 02:19:31,710
Think about it

1814
02:19:31,710 --> 02:19:34,090
Your muscles
make you so manly

1815
02:19:34,090 --> 02:19:37,260
You'll get a figure
gleaming like a sword

1816
02:19:37,260 --> 02:19:38,850
Honey and Gopi
Exchange

1817
02:19:38,850 --> 02:19:40,830
Mohini and Gaja?
Inter change?!

1818
02:19:40,830 --> 02:19:43,210
I just can't digest this

1819
02:19:43,210 --> 02:19:44,370
Astrologer genius!

1820
02:19:44,370 --> 02:19:46,460
'I am a chaste bachelor'

1821
02:19:46,460 --> 02:19:49,490
Anyone seeing us will
have the shock of their lives!

1822
02:19:49,490 --> 02:19:51,061
Bee lured by a flower makes sense
But flower and flower intertwined...?!

1823
02:19:51,061 --> 02:19:52,601
With Gaja there
With my daughter here

1824
02:19:52,601 --> 02:19:54,360
She's a woman
from out of this world

1825
02:19:54,360 --> 02:19:57,130
Bro-in-law! I'll go to the guest house
and meet the minister of mines

1826
02:19:57,130 --> 02:20:00,280
I'll grease his palms and
invite him for the wedding

1827
02:20:00,280 --> 02:20:01,500
Take care if the house

1828
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:02,521
'What is here
for me to take care?'

1829
02:20:02,521 --> 02:20:04,900
'I don't know whether to trust
that astrologer genius or not'

1830
02:20:04,900 --> 02:20:05,540
Wedding cards here

1831
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:05,980
Move away

1832
02:20:05,980 --> 02:20:07,931
'You have these boys
in your list too?!'

1833
02:20:07,931 --> 02:20:11,070
'See what I'll do to
your next flying kiss!'

1834
02:20:11,070 --> 02:20:12,460
Get into the car

1835
02:20:12,460 --> 02:20:14,210
Poking his nose
into everything!

1836
02:20:14,210 --> 02:20:15,891
"I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you"

1837
02:20:15,891 --> 02:20:16,141
"Have you heard
burra gira?"

1838
02:20:16,101 --> 02:20:19,050
"I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you"

1839
02:20:19,050 --> 02:20:21,410
"Have you heard
burra gira?"

1840
02:20:21,410 --> 02:20:25,320
"Hey baby...baby! Way you lobby
is loved by me, your rowdy hubby"

1841
02:20:25,320 --> 02:20:29,240
"Hey baby...baby..baby, my hobby
is to pinch your cheeks so chubby"

1842
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:35,650
"Your feelings for me, my dear hubby,
stir my soul like songs of Ghulam Nabi"

1843
02:20:35,650 --> 02:20:40,790
"Hearing Ghulam Nabi sing effortlessly
my heart goes lub-dub, lub-dub erratically"

1844
02:20:40,790 --> 02:20:42,660
"Head spinning
Burra gira"

1845
02:20:42,660 --> 02:20:44,530
"heart reeling
Burra gira"

1846
02:20:44,530 --> 02:20:46,410
"Body twisting
Burra gira"

1847
02:20:46,410 --> 02:20:48,280
"Breath twirling
Burra gira"

1848
02:20:48,280 --> 02:20:53,990
"I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you"

1849
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:58,990
"Have you heard
burra gira?"

1850
02:20:58,990 --> 02:21:02,320
"I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you"

1851
02:21:02,320 --> 02:21:05,150
"Have you heard
burra gira?"

1852
02:21:05,150 --> 02:21:11,931
"Lets freak out in tonight's party
Let's drink tequila mixed with todday"

1853
02:21:11,931 --> 02:21:18,931
"Sequined sari and floral lungi clothed
let's dance to folk song, Shakira both!"

1854
02:21:19,280 --> 02:21:26,280
"Can pubs or paise set your head reeling?
Can you beat this intoxicated feeling?"

1855
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:32,440
"Hearing him feverishly ravishing her lavishly
the vicious jackal covers its ears hastily"

1856
02:21:32,440 --> 02:21:33,620
"Body twisting
Burra gira"

1857
02:21:33,620 --> 02:21:34,790
"Breath twirling
Burra gira"

1858
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:35,971
"Head spinning
Burra gira"

1859
02:21:35,971 --> 02:21:37,141
"heart reeling
Burra gira"

1860
02:21:37,141 --> 02:21:40,750
"With my grip on your hips and all
time's right for us to have a ball"

1861
02:21:40,750 --> 02:21:47,750
"Moment your body touches me
I get turned on, I need you fully"

1862
02:21:59,540 --> 02:22:06,540
"Mango pickle in pizza and burger too
We should be like this combination new"

1863
02:22:16,261 --> 02:22:23,261
"Trible dance by disc jockey is new fashion
Drum beats by kollywood we follow fusion"

1864
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:37,471
"heart reeling
Burra gira"

1865
02:22:37,471 --> 02:22:41,931
"Head spinning
Burra gira"

1866
02:22:41,931 --> 02:22:46,400
"Breath twirling
Burra gira"

1867
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:50,860
"Body twisting
Burra gira"

1868
02:22:50,860 --> 02:22:53,920
"I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you"

1869
02:22:53,920 --> 02:22:57,660
"Have you heard
burra gira?"

1870
02:22:57,660 --> 02:23:03,630
"I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you"

1871
02:23:03,630 --> 02:23:07,370
"Have you heard
burra gira?"

1872
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:13,050
I cannot stay here
Let's go to the States

1873
02:23:13,050 --> 02:23:14,870
Why this unnecessary anger, father?

1874
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:18,490
Wow! Don't think I can't see through
your change of speech and attire

1875
02:23:18,490 --> 02:23:21,021
I also know
what you are up to!

1876
02:23:21,021 --> 02:23:22,130
I cannot tolerate this

1877
02:23:22,130 --> 02:23:22,540
Pack your stuff
and get ready

1878
02:23:22,540 --> 02:23:22,880
No, father, listen to m-

1879
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:23,351
What kind of a house is this!

1880
02:23:23,351 --> 02:23:23,601
- Hi Kuku
- What?

1881
02:23:23,551 --> 02:23:24,490
- Where is Mohini?
- She is in the shower

1882
02:23:24,490 --> 02:23:26,560
- Why did your come here?
- What about you?

1883
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:28,370
- I'm older than you
- Makes no difference

1884
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:29,670
Now why is HE here?

1885
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:29,931
You...?!

1886
02:23:29,931 --> 02:23:30,940
Why are you both here?

1887
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:33,450
You have Honey
So why are you here?

1888
02:23:33,450 --> 02:23:33,840
Shhhhh!

1889
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:36,550
Who are you...answer
Cat got your tongue?

1890
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:40,740
Why do you 'Stare daggers' at him?
He is MOhini's brother Mohan

1891
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:42,630
Is he Mohini's elder brother?

1892
02:23:42,630 --> 02:23:43,391
Yes, friend

1893
02:23:43,391 --> 02:23:44,900
Take your weapons off

1894
02:23:44,900 --> 02:23:48,120
Peeping Tom! Did you come to
ogle at my sister in the shower?

1895
02:23:48,120 --> 02:23:49,021
What kind of sons
have you raised?

1896
02:23:49,021 --> 02:23:49,840
Why did you come here?

1897
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:50,650
I came looking for my ball

1898
02:23:50,650 --> 02:23:50,920
Yes, father

1899
02:23:50,920 --> 02:23:52,410
You got away scot free
because I wasn't in my uniform

1900
02:23:52,410 --> 02:23:53,620
Otherwise you'd have been
shot dead in an 'encounter'

1901
02:23:53,620 --> 02:23:53,870
Police?!

1902
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:55,620
You are to blame,
brother-in-law

1903
02:23:55,620 --> 02:24:02,620
How can you make my sister
stay in this stupid hell hole...

1904
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:08,400
...when she's heiress
to billion millions?

1905
02:24:08,400 --> 02:24:09,950
- Heiress?!
- Millionairess?

1906
02:24:09,950 --> 02:24:15,370
Beacuse she loves you
I kept quiet

1907
02:24:15,370 --> 02:24:17,130
Do you know what kind]
of following she has?

1908
02:24:17,130 --> 02:24:19,021
'In your dreams'!

1909
02:24:19,021 --> 02:24:22,511
I'll prove it
in 1 second

1910
02:24:22,511 --> 02:24:23,780
Will you marry my sister?

1911
02:24:23,780 --> 02:24:27,891
Tell me which wedding hall
I should book for the ceremony?

1912
02:24:27,891 --> 02:24:28,370
You?

1913
02:24:28,370 --> 02:24:32,280
How many ever times
You ask me to

1914
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:33,040
That is Mohini's range

1915
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:33,290
Nothing is lost

1916
02:24:33,181 --> 02:24:33,431
Think again
Decide quickly

1917
02:24:33,370 --> 02:24:33,620
I'll come back later

1918
02:24:33,550 --> 02:24:40,550
Why don't you meet
Mohini and then leave?

1919
02:24:46,530 --> 02:24:53,530
She can come only if I go?!

1920
02:24:59,431 --> 02:25:00,370
I'll make arrangements for her wedding
and then only show my face to my sister

1921
02:25:00,370 --> 02:25:00,670
Suyodhana has organized
everything for the wedding today

1922
02:25:00,670 --> 02:25:02,851
Looks like what I thought should
not happen is bound to happen

1923
02:25:02,851 --> 02:25:09,851
Despite Naidu's assurances
I'm on tenterhooks

1924
02:25:18,250 --> 02:25:25,250
Naidu is calling us now

1925
02:25:52,521 --> 02:25:59,521
Dharma'nna, don't worry

1926
02:26:13,090 --> 02:26:20,090
I've also been waiting for today

1927
02:26:54,221 --> 02:27:01,221
Today will be the climax for
the villins like the last chapter...

1928
02:27:17,681 --> 02:27:17,931
...of 'Nartthanasala'
of Mahabharath

1929
02:27:17,771 --> 02:27:18,021
I have renewed faith now after
hearing Naidu's reassurances

1930
02:27:17,960 --> 02:27:18,210
Everyone here will
be getting married

1931
02:27:18,090 --> 02:27:18,340
When will we
get married, dear?

1932
02:27:18,221 --> 02:27:18,561
I've told you a zillion times
It won't happen

1933
02:27:18,561 --> 02:27:25,561
Forever obsessed with marriage
Aren't you ashamed?

1934
02:27:27,261 --> 02:27:34,261
Just because I'm following you
I'm object of ridicule to you!

1935
02:28:26,290 --> 02:28:26,940
We Indians know the value
of kohinoor diamond...

1936
02:28:26,940 --> 02:28:27,500
...only when the British took it away

1937
02:28:27,500 --> 02:28:28,221
You'll also realize only when
someone else marries me

1938
02:28:28,221 --> 02:28:28,471
Remember this, dear

1939
02:28:28,460 --> 02:28:29,170
1 second before
you get married..

1940
02:28:29,170 --> 02:28:29,420
I'll marry someone better
than you, equipped with...

1941
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:29,550
...muscle-power

1942
02:28:29,311 --> 02:28:29,561
...great looks

1943
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:29,590
...intelligence

1944
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:29,610
Otherwise I'll end my life
in this same house

1945
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:29,750
This is my Mohini's powerful vow

1946
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:30,190
"When we accidentally graze
and cares, what desires raise"

1947
02:28:30,190 --> 02:28:32,300
"when in the bath tub under a shower
goose bumps on my body spread all ove-"

1948
02:28:32,300 --> 02:28:33,490
Our bond will be
broken from today

1949
02:28:33,490 --> 02:28:33,740
Why?

1950
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:35,011
You'll be married
And I'll end my life

1951
02:28:35,011 --> 02:28:35,261
Let's elope

1952
02:28:35,150 --> 02:28:36,450
I'd have done so when I was 16
if eloping was the solution

1953
02:28:36,450 --> 02:28:37,641
Gopi should see me get married
in front of a huge gathering

1954
02:28:37,641 --> 02:28:39,030
If you have the guts, you are a man
and you really love me...

1955
02:28:39,030 --> 02:28:39,280
...ask your father's permission

1956
02:28:39,261 --> 02:28:39,590
Listen to me, Mohini

1957
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:39,840
Your wedding preparations
are on a super grand scale

1958
02:28:39,590 --> 02:28:39,840
Father, I need to
tell you something

1959
02:28:39,660 --> 02:28:40,261
Tell me after the wedding

1960
02:28:40,261 --> 02:28:40,511
It is regarding
the marriage

1961
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,471
Get me married to Mohini
in this same wedding hall

1962
02:28:41,471 --> 02:28:41,750
Whaaat?
Mohini...?

1963
02:28:41,750 --> 02:28:42,170
I love Mohini

1964
02:28:42,170 --> 02:28:42,780
You will be minus your head!
I intend marrying Mohini

1965
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:44,391
You won't have any
breath left in your body!

1966
02:28:44,391 --> 02:28:44,811
Mohini is mine only

1967
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:45,061
Gaja, how can you marry-

1968
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:45,061
I want to marry Mohini

1969
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:45,061
What about Dharma's daughter?

1970
02:28:44,811 --> 02:28:45,351
Ger her married to your friend
I saw them having a good time

1971
02:28:45,351 --> 02:28:45,601
What is my son saying?!

1972
02:28:45,460 --> 02:28:45,710
True, friend

1973
02:28:45,500 --> 02:28:46,110
The moment I stepped into your house
she came and fell all over me

1974
02:28:46,110 --> 02:28:46,360
Because of my friendship with you
I had no physical contact with her

1975
02:28:46,210 --> 02:28:47,101
Instead of 'declaring' our mutual love
I gave up the deal for our friendship

1976
02:28:47,101 --> 02:28:47,351
I scooted in the middle

1977
02:28:47,170 --> 02:28:47,420
Stop talking rubbish

1978
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:47,460
Get the sacred wedding thread

1979
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:47,530
If I marry Mohini, she is
as good as your daughter

1980
02:28:47,431 --> 02:28:47,681
If I marry her, she'll take
your mother's place

1981
02:28:47,550 --> 02:28:47,800
If I marry Mohini, she'll be
like a daughter to both of you!

1982
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:48,521
Why do you keep
piling insults?

1983
02:28:48,521 --> 02:28:48,771
Mohini is mine

1984
02:28:48,730 --> 02:28:49,000
Scant respect to
your elder brother!

1985
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:49,250
1 blow from me and
you'll be disfigured for life

1986
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:49,250
You want Mohini?

1987
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,511
The mace is our family deity

1988
02:28:51,511 --> 02:28:54,840
You are getting married to Honey...

1989
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:57,620
Mohini was born for me

1990
02:28:57,620 --> 02:29:00,880
You dare lift
the mace to hit me?!

1991
02:29:00,880 --> 02:29:01,681
I'll smash you to pieces

1992
02:29:01,681 --> 02:29:02,750
Being siblings, why are you fighting
for a female so shamlessly?

1993
02:29:02,750 --> 02:29:03,000
You are tarnishing
our family dignity

1994
02:29:02,891 --> 02:29:03,141
1 care 2 hoots

1995
02:29:02,980 --> 02:29:03,230
"Even if koel bleeds
from the hunter's arrow"

1996
02:29:03,160 --> 02:29:03,410
"You trampled my love
My heart beats in sorrow"

1997
02:29:03,360 --> 02:29:03,610
Mohini has consumed poison, uncle

1998
02:29:03,471 --> 02:29:03,721
Mohini....!

1999
02:29:03,490 --> 02:29:03,740
What happened to her?

2000
02:29:03,580 --> 02:29:03,830
Uncle, she swallowed poison

2001
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:03,920
Poison?

2002
02:29:03,700 --> 02:29:03,950
She drank every single drop

2003
02:29:03,811 --> 02:29:04,061
She's dead, friend

2004
02:29:03,880 --> 02:29:04,130
Aiyo! How could you
leave me and go?

2005
02:29:04,061 --> 02:29:04,331
She's written
a sucide note

2006
02:29:04,331 --> 02:29:05,190
- Read it out
- I don't know to read

2007
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:05,511
Let me read

2008
02:29:05,511 --> 02:29:06,050
Please read it out aloud

2009
02:29:06,050 --> 02:29:06,370
Greetings to all

2010
02:29:06,370 --> 02:29:07,120
This is Mohini writing
my farewell note

2011
02:29:07,120 --> 02:29:08,521
God gave me only 1 body
I wish he had given me 3!

2012
02:29:08,521 --> 02:29:14,221
I'd have married
all 3 brothers

2013
02:29:14,221 --> 02:29:20,891
I am like a bedside lamp
spreading my glow to 1 bed

2014
02:29:20,891 --> 02:29:24,271
But I want to be like flood lights
to light up an entire stadium

2015
02:29:24,271 --> 02:29:24,601
Not knowing which
bed I'll give light to...

2016
02:29:24,601 --> 02:29:24,851
...I'm switching off
my light myself

2017
02:29:24,851 --> 02:29:25,391
Eldest son Guna
is like a tube light

2018
02:29:25,391 --> 02:29:26,061
Such a good fellow

2019
02:29:26,061 --> 02:29:27,240
2nd son Gana is
like a torch

2020
02:29:27,240 --> 02:29:28,410
He'll shine when
there is no electricity

2021
02:29:28,410 --> 02:29:28,960
Why did you leave us, Mohini?

2022
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:29,210
Youngest Son Gaja
is like a focus light

2023
02:29:29,021 --> 02:29:29,420
He made me
completely focused

2024
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:29,670
- My Mohini...?
- Stop wailing!

2025
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:29,690
I'll miss all of you

2026
02:29:29,471 --> 02:29:29,721
If I have another birth...

2027
02:29:29,500 --> 02:29:30,480
....I'll take 3 avatars
and marry all 3 brothers

2028
02:29:30,480 --> 02:29:30,730
Bye

2029
02:29:30,610 --> 02:29:30,860
Police...!

2030
02:29:30,750 --> 02:29:31,521
Don't get scared
That's my ring tone

2031
02:29:31,521 --> 02:29:31,771
Mohan is calling me

2032
02:29:31,540 --> 02:29:31,790
Hello...?

2033
02:29:31,550 --> 02:29:31,800
I've been posted in
Dharwad now

2034
02:29:31,580 --> 02:29:31,830
I want to show off myself
in my police uniform to my sister

2035
02:29:31,660 --> 02:29:31,910
I'm coming
Bye

2036
02:29:31,681 --> 02:29:31,931
Your brother got himself posted
close by just to see you, Mohini

2037
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:32,000
Friend, save us somehow

2038
02:29:31,771 --> 02:29:32,021
(phony chants)

2039
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:32,030
My mohini is no more

2040
02:29:31,811 --> 02:29:32,061
Only you can revive her

2041
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:32,090
What did I tell you
half hour back?

2042
02:29:31,891 --> 02:29:32,141
Mohini will leave this earth

2043
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:32,170
It has come true

2044
02:29:31,940 --> 02:29:32,190
You are like a godsend
Please save us somehow

2045
02:29:32,190 --> 02:29:32,641
That's exactly why I came
I have an idea

2046
02:29:32,641 --> 02:29:32,990
Gopi loves Honey
We'll get them married

2047
02:29:32,990 --> 02:29:33,391
When Mohan comes
Gopi can handle any crisis

2048
02:29:33,391 --> 02:29:33,690
Gopi will do anything for love

2049
02:29:33,690 --> 02:29:35,080
Otherwise the cop-bro will land up
and shoot all of us down

2050
02:29:35,080 --> 02:29:36,271
Hurry up
Go and request him

2051
02:29:36,271 --> 02:29:43,271
A house with a funeral should perform
a wedding to turn the luck favorably

2052
02:29:45,771 --> 02:29:46,730
You marry Honey

2053
02:29:46,730 --> 02:29:47,700
Me? No. I can't

2054
02:29:47,700 --> 02:29:54,700
I won't take 'no' for an answer

2055
02:29:55,431 --> 02:30:00,950
- Okay, agreed
- Thank you, friend

2056
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:07,950
What do we do
to the dead body?

2057
02:30:09,790 --> 02:30:12,780
Bury her in the quarry

2058
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:17,210
We'll push it into the well

2059
02:30:17,210 --> 02:30:22,580
We can convince she fell in
while taking water from the well

2060
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:22,830
Lift the corpse

2061
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:22,830
I'll handle it
You relax

2062
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:22,830
Not any of ypu
We need a special team

2063
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:22,830
Hey! You both

2064
02:30:22,580 --> 02:30:23,000
Come and carry her

2065
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:24,480
If you dare touch her
you'll be mincemeat

2066
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:25,590
You can't touch my sacred Mohini

2067
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:26,880
"May you be, lovely lady
Married jappily"

2068
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:27,130
Pathstic!

2069
02:30:27,061 --> 02:30:27,990
"With longevity
be married blissfully"

2070
02:30:27,990 --> 02:30:28,910
Give me the sacred thread

2071
02:30:28,910 --> 02:30:29,160
Mohini....!

2072
02:30:29,090 --> 02:30:30,391
I made you win
by marrying you

2073
02:30:30,391 --> 02:30:32,050
Mohan will be here anytime
You can lament later

2074
02:30:32,050 --> 02:30:32,601
Put me down

2075
02:30:32,601 --> 02:30:33,011
Saree pin is poking me

2076
02:30:33,011 --> 02:30:35,170
Drape the doll
in this sari quickly

2077
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:35,420
mY Dear sister....?

2078
02:30:35,170 --> 02:30:35,420
You look awesome in
this police uniform

2079
02:30:35,181 --> 02:30:35,431
I'll shake hands first
only with my sister

2080
02:30:35,190 --> 02:30:35,440
Where is she?

2081
02:30:35,181 --> 02:30:38,250
I must thank you

2082
02:30:38,250 --> 02:30:45,250
Because you rejected her,
I fixed her wedding with...

2083
02:31:11,721 --> 02:31:18,721
...Home minister's youngest son
I want to convey this to her

2084
02:31:45,670 --> 02:31:47,460
Where is Mohini?

2085
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:48,061
Mohini...Mohin-

2086
02:31:48,061 --> 02:31:51,050
What happened
to my Mohini?

2087
02:31:51,050 --> 02:31:56,431
Mohini has left us and gone
my dear brother-in-law

2088
02:31:56,431 --> 02:31:59,420
What happened
to my Mohini?

2089
02:31:59,420 --> 02:32:00,610
Keep quiet!

2090
02:32:00,610 --> 02:32:02,410
Where is she?

2091
02:32:02,410 --> 02:32:04,900
She has gone to the temple to fulfill
her vow, praying for your posting

2092
02:32:04,900 --> 02:32:05,150
Look how fond
my sister is of me

2093
02:32:04,971 --> 02:32:05,221
I'll go to the temple and ask her
to put this cap on my head!

2094
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Wait

2095
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
She sais she'd come...

2096
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
....to the wedding hall
directly from the temple

2097
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Why?

2098
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Gopi and Honey
are getting married

2099
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
What?
When did this happen?

2100
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
I'll explain it to you

2101
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Come with me

2102
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
My Mohini!

2103
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
If Mohan hears this
we'll all join her too!

2104
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Go inside

2105
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
People of Pandavapuram
and Jauravapuram

2106
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
My friend Gopi and
Dharmanna's daughter, Honey

2107
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
...are in love with each other

2108
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Both families
are united by love

2109
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Both villages can
also unite by love

2110
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
I've set aside my revenge
whole heartedly and...

2111
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
...persuaded Dharma'nna
So shower your blessings

2112
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Mohini....!

2113
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Let's go to the wedding hall

2114
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
I'm hungry

2115
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Why did you leave me and go

2116
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Cry! Serves you right

2117
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Evil spirit strikes again!

2118
02:32:05,080 --> 02:32:05,330
Are you calling me an evil spirit
You son of a mongrel!!

2119
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:05,380
You loony fellow!
All this is a drama

2120
02:32:05,130 --> 02:32:05,380
That astrologer genius, Gambler Gopi
and the Malayali cook belong to 1 family

2121
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:05,400
Mohini doesn't even exist!

2122
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:05,400
What are you saying?

2123
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:05,400
Listen to me carefully

2124
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:05,410
What is he doing here?

2125
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:05,410
Did you tie yourself up
with these ropes, Siddha?

2126
02:32:05,170 --> 02:32:05,420
Why would I do that?

2127
02:32:05,181 --> 02:32:05,431
Ones who hid Honey in Bangkok

2128
02:32:05,181 --> 02:32:05,431
Those who hit me with the mace

2129
02:32:05,190 --> 02:32:05,440
Ones who tied me up now

2130
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:05,450
They are all part of 1 group

2131
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:05,450
1 family

2132
02:32:05,200 --> 02:32:05,450
Oh my God!

2133
02:32:05,210 --> 02:32:05,460
1st untie me

2134
02:32:05,210 --> 02:32:05,460
Goddamn you!

2135
02:32:05,210 --> 02:32:05,460
Boss!

2136
02:32:05,210 --> 02:32:05,460
This is not Mohini

2137
02:32:05,221 --> 02:32:05,471
Just a doll

2138
02:32:05,221 --> 02:32:05,471
Look at this wig

2139
02:32:05,221 --> 02:32:05,471
Mohini has duped you

2140
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:05,480
Mohini...!

2141
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:05,480
Father...!!

2142
02:32:05,230 --> 02:32:05,480
'This scared thread I tie around
your neck ensures longevity'

2143
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:05,490
'Oh maiden with auspicious attributes!
may you live a 100 years happily with me'

2144
02:32:05,250 --> 02:32:05,500
Father...!

2145
02:32:05,250 --> 02:32:05,500
We have all been duped

2146
02:32:05,261 --> 02:32:05,511
Mohini doesn't exist
It is just a doll

2147
02:32:05,271 --> 02:32:05,521
We were cheated
They belong to 1 family

2148
02:32:05,271 --> 02:32:05,521
I'm the head of deception
You've deceived me

2149
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:05,530
You started this game
I'm giving the final touch

2150
02:32:05,290 --> 02:32:05,540
You won by Ranga's cues
Wasn't that wrong?

2151
02:32:05,300 --> 02:32:05,550
Isn't it true you buried him
in your quarry after killing him?

2152
02:32:05,311 --> 02:32:05,561
Answer me

2153
02:32:05,311 --> 02:32:05,561
I'll seal your fate forever now

2154
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:05,570
Wait, friend

2155
02:32:05,320 --> 02:32:05,570
Love, marriage and
problem are all mine

2156
02:32:05,330 --> 02:32:05,580
They came here for me

2157
02:32:05,330 --> 02:32:05,580
You want to hurt anyone
Let it be me, not any of them

2158
02:32:05,340 --> 02:32:05,590
Aim your anger at us
Not our parents

2159
02:32:05,351 --> 02:32:05,601
Wait

2160
02:32:05,351 --> 02:32:05,601
This game is mine
I orchestrated it

2161
02:32:05,360 --> 02:32:05,610
They are youngsters
Don't involve them

2162
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:05,620
Enough, dad

2163
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:05,620
You've sacrificed
your whole life for us

2164
02:32:05,370 --> 02:32:05,620
Even if we didn't know our parents
you showered us with tender loving care

2165
02:32:05,391 --> 02:32:05,641
Nothing should happen to you

2166
02:32:05,391 --> 02:32:05,641
Vijju....?

2167
02:32:05,391 --> 02:32:05,641
Ma, we didn't want you
to know we knew the truth

2168
02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:05,660
So we buried it
deep in our hearts

2169
02:32:05,410 --> 02:32:05,660
We can't ever repay
your unconditional love

2170
02:32:05,420 --> 02:32:05,670
My dear son, Ajay

2171
02:32:05,420 --> 02:32:05,670
Without going through the pains of
childbirth...is she fit to be a mother?

2172
02:32:05,440 --> 02:32:05,690
He picked up road side kids
and calls himself a father!!

2173
02:32:05,450 --> 02:32:05,700
These boys who were left-overs
from trash cans are his sons!

2174
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:05,710
Orphans

2175
02:32:05,460 --> 02:32:05,710
Say what you want about me
I'll take it in my stride

2176
02:32:05,471 --> 02:32:05,721
You dare deride my sons...

2177
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:05,730
...I'll slice you to pieces
and pickle you

2178
02:32:05,480 --> 02:32:05,730
Without shedding a drop of blood,
my dad wanted to rescue Honey

2179
02:32:05,500 --> 02:32:05,750
And you made me witness
my dad's blood spill all over

2180
02:32:05,511 --> 02:32:05,761
I'll shatter your head to pieces

2181
02:32:05,511 --> 02:32:05,761
Drop it down

2182
02:32:05,511 --> 02:32:05,761
- Sit down
- Mohini...?

2183
02:32:05,521 --> 02:32:05,771
Shoot

2184
02:32:05,521 --> 02:32:05,771
Big mistake

2185
02:32:05,521 --> 02:32:05,771
There's just 1 vowel difference
between Dharma and Adharma!

2186
02:32:05,530 --> 02:32:05,780
A man living in wicked ways
is as good as dead even if alive

2187
02:32:05,540 --> 02:32:05,790
A good man lives in many
hearts even after he dies

2188
02:32:05,550 --> 02:32:05,800
You decide your path

2189
02:32:05,561 --> 02:32:05,811
In any century, to destroy a Kaurava
like you who is cruel and unjust...

2190
02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:05,820
...Pandavas will come as saviors
in some form or the other for sure

2191
02:32:05,580 --> 02:32:05,830
You upheld your word of honor

2192
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:05,840
Dharma'nna, I'm strong in taking a vow
But my weakness is in not letting it go

2193
02:32:05,610 --> 02:32:05,860
Kuku...Where are you?

2194
02:32:05,610 --> 02:32:05,860
What's all this problem
in the midst of this wedding?

2195
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:05,870
Why are you here?

2196
02:32:05,620 --> 02:32:05,870
Time for our flight...come

2197
02:32:05,630 --> 02:32:05,880
These 2 are married?

2198
02:32:05,630 --> 02:32:05,880
They were in love
They got married

2199
02:32:05,641 --> 02:32:05,891
Who were in love?
How does it concern you?

2200
02:32:05,650 --> 02:32:05,900
- Let's go
- I won't

2201
02:32:05,650 --> 02:32:05,900
Why won't you?

2202
02:32:05,650 --> 02:32:05,900
I'm in love with Mohan

2203
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:05,910
Who is Mohan?

2204
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:05,910
I'm Mohan

2205
02:32:05,660 --> 02:32:05,910
is it enough
if they love each other

2206
02:32:05,670 --> 02:32:05,920
Shouldn't I know
who the parents are?

2207
02:32:05,681 --> 02:32:05,931
They are his elder brother
and sister-in-law

2208
02:32:05,681 --> 02:32:05,931
Who is Mohini?

2209
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:05,940
Uncle, will you get me 2 oranges?

2210
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:05,940
Oranges?!

2211
02:32:05,690 --> 02:32:05,940
Mohan and Mohoini
are 1 and the same

2212
02:32:05,700 --> 02:32:05,950
I've been watching you
from the beginning

2213
02:32:05,710 --> 02:32:05,960
I won't let you go
whatever you say

2214
02:32:05,721 --> 02:32:05,971
I won't leave you
I can see your end

2215
02:32:05,730 --> 02:32:05,980
Subtitled by rekhs

2216
02:32:05,730 --> 02:32:05,980
"Move...move...make way
Just watch this colorful display"

2217
02:32:05,740 --> 02:32:05,990
Not just one but five
Let's give them a high-5!"

2218
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:06,000
"Not only mesmerized
Seeing them will be joy multiplied"

2219
02:32:05,750 --> 02:32:06,000
"Shout out a hip hip hurray
To the Pandavas holding sway"

2220
02:32:05,761 --> 02:32:06,011
"Lord Krishna and his magic touch
His support means somuch"

2221
02:32:05,771 --> 02:32:06,021
"Screenplay is also Krnsa's ,might
Age and gender barred delight"

2222
02:32:05,780 --> 02:32:06,030
"Entertainment, fun filled fare
You'll be happy you went to the theater"
