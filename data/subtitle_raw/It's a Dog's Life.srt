1
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,357
We ate at
only the best restaurants

2
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,750
in the waterfront
of little old New York.

3
00:02:20,792 --> 00:02:23,579
Well behind the best
restaurants anyway.

4
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,538
Half of this garbage
can belonged to

5
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,541
me and my mother.
Everybody knew that.

6
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:30,934
That's ma working on a steak bone.

7
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:32,849
As for those mongrels

8
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:33,937
thinking they're gonna
push us out of the away

9
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:36,592
that was a large mistake.

10
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:39,291
Although I do not
admire the expression.

11
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:43,991
It was strictly dog-eat-dog
on the waterfront.

12
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,593
It was also at times
quite a bit of fun.

13
00:02:50,474 --> 00:02:52,478
Wasn't just a salami.

14
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,436
It was a thrill of a chase.

15
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:57,831
The hide and seek that I liked.

16
00:02:57,873 --> 00:03:00,442
And also my old friend
captain was getting pretty old

17
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:01,877
and couldn't grab
for food anymore.

18
00:03:14,281 --> 00:03:16,110
I like to hide
in the old warehouse.

19
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:19,157
It was cool and quiet

20
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,854
and also happened
to be where I was born.

21
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,856
Sometimes I wondered

22
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,901
if it was wise to bring
my mother back there.

23
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:26,336
She was your kind of a sad look.

24
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:41,396
Then I began to get a glimmer
of maybe what made her sad.

25
00:03:41,438 --> 00:03:43,224
It was what those
other dogs barked at me,

26
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,270
from a safe distance for them.

27
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:47,054
Things like where is your father?

28
00:03:47,096 --> 00:03:49,622
Ask your mother if you dare.

29
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:52,799
You don't even know
who your old man is.

30
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,409
Well, being his mother

31
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:57,369
didn't wanna talk about
the sad situation,

32
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:00,763
I went to see my
old friend captain.

33
00:04:00,805 --> 00:04:01,938
Captain knew everything
that went on

34
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,985
waterfront, so I asked him.

35
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:07,596
When captain got to his feet,
you know it's serious.

36
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:10,077
The last time he got up an
epidemic up this temper spread

37
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,993
through the waterfront like
fleas to a muscovites beard.

38
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:16,039
The time before two cargo
ships burn to the waterline.

39
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:20,261
I got a little scared.

40
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,263
Well I asked for it and I got it.

41
00:04:22,305 --> 00:04:25,310
Both barrels.

42
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:28,269
Captain said I was
old enough to know.

43
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,532
My father was a great dog alright.

44
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:33,013
Champion regent royal.

45
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:36,146
How's that for a handle?

46
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:39,237
He had cornered my mother,
father her children,

47
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,849
without benefit of clergy.

48
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:47,332
And then melted into the
crowd never to be seen again.

49
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,464
Now I understood what
those other dogs meant

50
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,119
when they called me 'a dirty,
no good, son of a black and tan'.

51
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:54,600
I made up my mind.

52
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:55,905
First, to tell my mother
that it didn't make a whisk

53
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,081
of a difference to me.

54
00:04:58,123 --> 00:05:00,562
Second, I'd find
my father and kill him.

55
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,006
Mother wasn't home
when I got back,

56
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:13,575
I laid down and waited for her.

57
00:05:13,617 --> 00:05:14,617
She never came back.

58
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:29,243
I won't bore you
with my troubles journey

59
00:05:29,285 --> 00:05:31,637
for the next two
weeks but I'll say this.

60
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:33,900
Without sleep I covered
every square-foot

61
00:05:33,942 --> 00:05:35,728
of the city of new
York looking for my mother.

62
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:38,818
I never found her.

63
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,950
But I did find something I
never knew existed.

64
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:44,171
The Bowery,
the Bowery, the Bowery!

65
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,434
Only at the Bowery do
you see the most amazing,

66
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,132
the most fantastic attractions.

67
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:53,267
Such as the Patagonia
fire-eater, also the human...

68
00:05:53,309 --> 00:05:57,097
what a place and tough.

69
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:00,143
So tough that down herein
Bowery during high-mass,

70
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,623
they allowed smoking
in the last three rows.

71
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:07,977
Such noise, such excitement,
every day was a clambake.

72
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:10,153
Everybody looked as happy as sin,

73
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:11,416
even in the place
they called the mission.

74
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,295
Get out of here!

75
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:18,874
I could not believe my eyes.

76
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:21,007
Here in a Bowery were
dogs who looked just like me.

77
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,922
But they were living like kings

78
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,272
and you'll never guess why.

79
00:07:25,314 --> 00:07:27,666
Because they were dogs
who fought each other,

80
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,451
not for fun and not for food.

81
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:34,063
But for the sport
of their masters.

82
00:07:34,105 --> 00:07:39,155
I remember captain telling me
about these professional mutts.

83
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:42,289
With my mother gone I had
to find my own way in life.

84
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:44,246
How to make these men in
the saloon notice me?

85
00:07:54,082 --> 00:07:55,431
Come on. Come on.

86
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:05,573
Easy, easy.

87
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:08,315
Atta boy.

88
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,186
Where did he come from?

89
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:12,058
Some nut has
her dog days of course!

90
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,016
Attacking masterful,

91
00:08:14,058 --> 00:08:16,410
look at the way he is
breathing now. He's dead game.

92
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:21,676
He doing pretty good there.

93
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:23,417
Why Don't we
toss him in with masterful?

94
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:25,680
It'll give him a chance
to sharpen his teeth on.

95
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,377
Who bet
against a champ now?

96
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,858
- Me.
- You on!

97
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,077
For home...paddy
Hold on, hold on.

98
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:33,079
Gentlemen hold on.

99
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:33,906
There will
be no free and easy fighting,

100
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:35,690
here at Corbin's place.

101
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:38,040
That is unless Corbin
gets a bet in first.

102
00:08:38,082 --> 00:08:39,651
Here he's no Corbin, take that.

103
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,130
Nobody owns him.

104
00:08:41,172 --> 00:08:42,305
It looks that way.

105
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,656
Well, we can't take him, can we?

106
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:45,439
Looks like
he might be

107
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:46,962
a real scrapper, Corbin.

108
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:48,268
Now aimless fighting

109
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,662
is a sin, gentlemen, you know it.

110
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:53,621
We only fight dogs for a record
or to establish a championship.

111
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:55,101
Look at him!

112
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,711
He isn't a scrap.

113
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:59,714
Here is a great
piece of dog flesh.

114
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:02,978
Young but as finely potent as
the handle of St. Peter's harp.

115
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,024
He's mine, I saw him first.

116
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,852
I kinda
like this dog myself.

117
00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,114
Just a minute gentlemen,
just a minute.

118
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:10,159
I make the arrangements here.

119
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,241
Patch, come on follow
me and bring the dog with you.

120
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,860
Gentlemen.

121
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,775
We are about to
participate in the first,

122
00:09:16,817 --> 00:09:19,081
the only,
the original dog lottery.

123
00:09:19,123 --> 00:09:21,040
Come gentlemen, for $1,

124
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,955
you can buy a chance

125
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,957
on this magnificent
specimen of bull-terrier.

126
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:26,175
Where does the money go?

127
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,090
You're aren't the first man

128
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:29,048
who doesn't pay his
bar bill on Saturday!

129
00:09:36,184 --> 00:09:38,927
Elsa, I had a dream
about you last night

130
00:09:38,969 --> 00:09:40,189
- Really, honey?
- Yeah.

131
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,104
What?

132
00:09:42,146 --> 00:09:44,585
In this dream you were

133
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:49,634
found in an alley
with your head kicked in.

134
00:09:49,676 --> 00:09:52,898
Really, Patch? Why?

135
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,725
Because you wouldn't
give me a dollar

136
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,902
when I asked you for it!

137
00:09:56,944 --> 00:10:01,036
Oh, really Patch!

138
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:04,083
You have hidden charms, Elsa.

139
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,694
Not to my friends.

140
00:10:06,736 --> 00:10:09,305
I shall pay this back
with interest and affection.

141
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:12,700
You can skip the interest.

142
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:15,529
Thanks honey!

143
00:10:15,571 --> 00:10:17,357
Thank you, sir. Anyone else?

144
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,587
Number 16.

145
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,067
Number 16.

146
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:34,896
That's me, Mr. Corbin.

147
00:10:34,938 --> 00:10:39,292
Gentlemen, the winner is Mr.
Patch McGills.

148
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,902
You going to Patch McGills,
you hear?

149
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:42,338
And you're going to be

150
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,862
the toughest fighting dog
on the Bowery.

151
00:10:43,904 --> 00:10:45,777
And you're gonna
do exactly what I say

152
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:46,865
or I'll beat your
brains out twice a week!

153
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:48,693
Understand?

154
00:10:48,735 --> 00:10:51,783
Ah, Patch Mcgill.

155
00:10:51,825 --> 00:10:55,308
It was just what I
wanted my master to be.

156
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,052
Tough. As tough as
I'd have to be to fight.

157
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,358
When Patch Mcgill
snuck a lose dollar,

158
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,058
he'd walk right through
a solid brick wall and get it.

159
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:10,279
I like him,
he was my kind of people.

160
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,064
Now we're broke.

161
00:11:12,106 --> 00:11:13,543
I spent my last
hard-earned dollar on you.

162
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:16,111
We're gonna need money.

163
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:18,548
Now you wait here
until I come out for you.

164
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:21,639
When I take you inside
you give out with a personality.

165
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,841
If you want to eat next week.

166
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:27,819
Patch!

167
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:32,737
Ha-ha-ha!

168
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:36,958
Hi, baby!

169
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,526
You
came a little late for this.

170
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:40,962
I gotta get
on the palace gardens

171
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:42,527
before five so I
can actually guard it.

172
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,145
Ah, I tell you there's nothing like

173
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:51,233
watching a woman
pretty up her face.

174
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:52,844
Ha-ha-ha.

175
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:54,236
You've been working, huh.

176
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:55,542
I got a surprise
that is gonna knock you

177
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:56,630
right our your little slippers.

178
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:59,154
You finally took a job?

179
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:02,941
- Oh, anybody can get a job.
- Yeah, anybody except you.

180
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,246
I, I've been waiting
for one thing.

181
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,161
A business on my own.

182
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,380
And opportunity
is finally knocking.

183
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,295
What kinda business?

184
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,254
The kind that puts me in
coarse cigars and you in furs.

185
00:12:12,296 --> 00:12:14,779
Pick up a check,
quit your job and live like a queen.

186
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,085
- As missus Patch Mcgill?
- As missus Patch Mcgill.

187
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:18,870
Ha-ha!

188
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:20,567
I couldn't think
of anything worse.

189
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,874
- All I need is 20 bucks!
- 20 bucks!

190
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,312
Yeah, well you're
not gonna get it.

191
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:28,880
Now look honey, why make trouble?

192
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,185
You always end up
giving it to me anyway.

193
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:33,406
Well this time I'm not gonna.

194
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,103
If you don't give it to me,
I'll break you all to smash.

195
00:12:35,145 --> 00:12:37,932
You just try it.

196
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:46,680
I don't suppose you
wanna watch anymore at that.

197
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,029
He asked he again for the money

198
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:50,684
and she turned him down cold.

199
00:12:50,726 --> 00:12:55,428
So he used a little psychology.

200
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,385
He grabbed her by the
throat and slammed her

201
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:59,693
right up against the wall.

202
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,434
That convinced her.

203
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:03,305
I'll never understand people

204
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:04,916
because what happened next,

205
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:05,958
you wouldn't believe!

206
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:15,970
Ah, Patch!

207
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:19,321
You're a real strong boy!

208
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,020
Only when I'm near you.

209
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:25,980
You're like fire in my veins.

210
00:13:26,022 --> 00:13:27,199
Well, aren't you gonna
ask what business I am in?

211
00:13:27,241 --> 00:13:29,201
Oh, Patch!

212
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,725
We'll get there in the end.

213
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:32,508
Right now I’m having a good time.

214
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,380
No, I mean it.

215
00:13:34,422 --> 00:13:36,643
I don't take money
from girl's for fun.

216
00:13:36,685 --> 00:13:38,688
This money is gonna buy food,

217
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,256
equipment, finest training.

218
00:13:41,298 --> 00:13:44,607
- For what?
- For a dog.

219
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:47,219
- A dog?
- Yup.

220
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,090
You give me that money back.

221
00:13:49,132 --> 00:13:50,875
Now wait a minute
this is a bull terrier.

222
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,877
The finest I ever laid my eyes on.

223
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,879
I don't care if it's a solid gold
ten-carat greyhound!

224
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:56,576
I'm not slaving every night

225
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:58,099
at the palace gardens
to keep a dog and bones.

226
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:00,101
This is a fighting dog.

227
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:01,842
For 20 bucks I'll
fight him myself.

228
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:04,714
I can make $500-$1000 a fight.

229
00:14:04,756 --> 00:14:06,542
Well, who does he fight,
diamond Jim Brady?

230
00:14:06,584 --> 00:14:08,414
Other dogs.

231
00:14:08,456 --> 00:14:10,895
What other dogs got
that kind of money?

232
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:14,724
People. People pay to watch

233
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:17,162
why I can make a
fortune on wildfire.

234
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,381
That's what I'll call him,
wildfire.

235
00:14:19,423 --> 00:14:21,079
Did you ever see a
fire start in the grass?

236
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:23,037
It goes wild,
sweeps right on through.

237
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:24,822
And that's what he's gonna do.

238
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,345
He'll sweep right on
through to the championship.

239
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,782
Where did you ever see any grass?

240
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:31,829
They grow down on the
floor at Corbin saloon?

241
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,047
Would you like to see the dog?

242
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:34,048
You got him in your pocket?

243
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,842
Mabel Maycroft, meet wildfire.

244
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,757
I'm gonna manage
him to the championship.

245
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,630
You'll party that 20 bucks
of your in the thousands.

246
00:14:50,672 --> 00:14:54,416
That's the ugliest
thing I've ever seen.

247
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:56,243
What did she expect, a peacock?

248
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,879
Good boy, wildfire!

249
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,359
Alright, you can take a rest.

250
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,927
I never had any trouble
fighting on the waterfront.

251
00:15:26,969 --> 00:15:29,190
But this professional
fighting was different.

252
00:15:29,232 --> 00:15:32,367
This was tangling with
dogs who fought to win.

253
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:35,066
Because if they lost,
they were dead.

254
00:15:35,108 --> 00:15:36,981
That's the best
steak money can buy,

255
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:40,375
13 cents a pound.

256
00:15:40,417 --> 00:15:43,074
Pure bottled spring water.

257
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,684
I don't want you
drinking out of gutters.

258
00:15:44,726 --> 00:15:46,512
You might get
typhoid or something.

259
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:49,515
This has all the germs removed.

260
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:57,349
Drink it before any dust falls in.

261
00:15:57,391 --> 00:15:59,699
Now on you got two choices, kid.

262
00:15:59,741 --> 00:16:01,021
You need to be champion or dead!

263
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,453
Five weeks later
I stepped into the ring,

264
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,934
back at Corbin's bar.

265
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,719
In a room filled with rum,
smoke and money,

266
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:23,331
the local sporting gentry
had come to my first bout.

267
00:16:23,373 --> 00:16:26,900
Which most to them
figured to be my last.

268
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,858
Well Patch and me,
we figured it different.

269
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,599
Remember what I told you.

270
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,558
Don't waste your breath
barking or growling.

271
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,299
Don't chew up any
fancy spins or slices.

272
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:36,518
Just drive in and get him.

273
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,651
Turn the tables,
you are three-to-one.

274
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:43,090
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

275
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,353
Quiet!

276
00:16:45,395 --> 00:16:48,095
The betting is now closed.

277
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:49,792
And there will be no
drinking during the fight.

278
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,491
For a purse of $100,

279
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:55,146
paddy Corbin is most happy

280
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,670
to being you that always
dangerous canine fighter.

281
00:16:57,712 --> 00:16:59,150
Ruffie's cantanker!

282
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:05,286
And the challenger,
a newcomer to the Bowery.

283
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,245
Patch Mcgill's wildfire.

284
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,556
Are you ready to go?

285
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:16,819
- Ready.
- Ready.

286
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,691
Face your dogs.

287
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:23,432
Make ready.

288
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,490
Fight!

289
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:04,302
- Jeremiah Edward E. A.
- Would you say that man

290
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,173
was good or bad?

291
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:08,610
I'd say he was good.

292
00:18:08,652 --> 00:18:11,483
But it would be easier
to prove that he was bad.

293
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,310
When I take that,

294
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,573
take that for example.

295
00:18:14,615 --> 00:18:17,097
It took man to teach
a dog to fight for money.

296
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,446
I never heard of a dog

297
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,491
that had a daughter fight for her.

298
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:21,971
That's where you're wrong.

299
00:18:22,013 --> 00:18:26,367
Dogs still possess a spiritual
wealth that men have lost.

300
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:29,283
Would 50,000 gather
to bet their soup bones

301
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,285
that one man could kill another?

302
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,417
I don't get you.

303
00:18:32,459 --> 00:18:34,332
Well look at it this way,

304
00:18:34,374 --> 00:18:37,204
do dogs follow the leader?

305
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:40,077
Do they drink because
everybody drinks?

306
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,470
Do they paint themselves blue
because blue is fashionable?

307
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:46,170
Bah! They do not!

308
00:18:46,212 --> 00:18:52,263
They're proud,
self-reliant individuals.

309
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,438
Would you mind wetting
the bottom of that a little?

310
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:04,057
I mean man, man is the handler.

311
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,103
He sees in dogs the
qualities he has lost.

312
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,192
But does he respect them? No!

313
00:19:08,234 --> 00:19:10,107
He exploits them.

314
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,240
Just as he is
exploiting his own soul.

315
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:19,899
Watch out, watch out!
Here comes the winner.

316
00:19:19,941 --> 00:19:21,509
Carney, see if you
can find some caviar

317
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:23,468
on the free lunch table.
- Okay, Patch.

318
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,559
The money, Corbin, the money.

319
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:30,649
First in a long line
of prizes for Patch Mcgill.

320
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:31,998
The drinks are on me, boys.

321
00:19:46,054 --> 00:19:48,362
I fought twice a week after
that for almost four months.

322
00:19:48,404 --> 00:19:50,059
Toast to wildfire!

323
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,847
I was the talk of
the sporting world.

324
00:19:54,889 --> 00:19:57,893
The hottest dime since bock beer.

325
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,243
There is no need to
show you any the fights,

326
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:02,028
they were pretty brutal.

327
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:04,813
And I might add, we now had
those two great organizations,

328
00:20:04,855 --> 00:20:07,555
the American humane
association & society

329
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,905
for the prevention
of cruelty to animals,

330
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:12,952
better known as the SPCA,
well deserving of your support.

331
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,496
Honey, you're looking
high up on a horse.

332
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:37,759
Right, wildfire?

333
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,632
High up on the
dog was more like it.

334
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:48,117
Patch, you look like a real swell.

335
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,945
Patch, watch out,
you'll spill some liquor on me.

336
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:52,992
It's eight years
old bottle in Bonn.

337
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:55,168
You'll smell like a debutante
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

338
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,865
Well, just don't spill
the chase around me too.

339
00:20:56,907 --> 00:20:57,997
These are my best clothes.

340
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,781
Honey stop worrying.

341
00:20:59,823 --> 00:21:00,913
In a couple a seconds
you'd be throwing them

342
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,610
duds out of the window.

343
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:05,918
Why, Patch Mcgill?!

344
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:10,662
What I mean is I...
I got you a little present.

345
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,968
- For me?
- Yup.

346
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,622
From a guy who thinks you
to be the last thing every night

347
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:15,797
and first thing every morning.

348
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:17,712
Oh, Patch.

349
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:19,321
You shouldn't have.

350
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:35,817
Just my colours.

351
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:39,343
- Do you know what I feel like?
- No.

352
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:42,998
A rich caterpillar.

353
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,087
Honey, I have never
seen anything like you.

354
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,915
Just like you've stepped
out of a store window.

355
00:21:46,957 --> 00:21:50,615
Yeah! Right through the glass.

356
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:55,359
Patch.

357
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:56,969
I bet that there's not
another woman in the world

358
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,360
with a man like you.

359
00:22:03,104 --> 00:22:06,065
I knew you couldn't go
on being a bum all your life.

360
00:22:06,107 --> 00:22:08,763
I knew you'd turn
out good some day.

361
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:10,939
Well, honey as long
as I can keep on fighting

362
00:22:10,981 --> 00:22:12,637
you're gonna live like a queen.

363
00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:16,554
I'm gonna buy you the
best duds money can buy.

364
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:20,122
And you got such
a good taste that I...

365
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,647
well, I hate to criticize.

366
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:25,127
- Criticize what?
- Him.

367
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:28,261
What's wrong with him?

368
00:22:28,303 --> 00:22:33,875
Well if there's anything I hate,
it's a gaudy dog.

369
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:38,445
Listen to the rich caterpillar.

370
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,795
Some nights when
the bourbon and Mable

371
00:22:40,837 --> 00:22:42,754
Maycroft's cheap perfume gota
little too heavy in the air...

372
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:45,147
I would sneak out.

373
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:47,149
I always had the hope
of finding my mother,

374
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:49,848
but I never did.

375
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,284
And I always had the
hope of finding my old man,

376
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:53,634
for a different reason.

377
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,984
And I couldn't understand
never meeting him,

378
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:59,553
because he was called
'champion regent royal'.

379
00:22:59,595 --> 00:23:02,339
Yet the only champion
I knew was a rough, tough,

380
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,080
experienced murderer
called masterful.

381
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,122
My next opponent.

382
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:24,448
To the memory of masterful
and a new champion, wildfire.

383
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,624
Gentlemen, the drinks
are on paddy Corbin.

384
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:33,152
Hurray!!

385
00:23:33,194 --> 00:23:34,936
Looks who's coming in?

386
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:37,635
Looks who's coming in?

387
00:23:37,677 --> 00:23:39,941
The heavy weight
champion of the world!

388
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,942
John L. Sullivan!

389
00:23:51,517 --> 00:23:52,867
And a good evening to you,
gentleman.

390
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,221
Thank you,
for your kind reception.

391
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:01,180
Now come on boys
get out of the doorway,

392
00:24:01,222 --> 00:24:03,748
come on, this is no
place for the likes of you.

393
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:09,536
John L. Sullivan,
now I can die happy.

394
00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:10,885
Well, it's an honor
to have you, John.

395
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:11,930
The house is yours.

396
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,410
What will it be?

397
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,195
No, no, no money, no money.

398
00:24:16,237 --> 00:24:18,850
Well, bring me the
biggest schooner of beer

399
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:19,938
you've got in this place.

400
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,635
Uh, filled with bourbon!

401
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,817
Well, could it be that Corbin
sis always this popular?

402
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:31,471
Or is there some
special event going on

403
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:32,472
that has escaped me noticed?

404
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:34,213
Patch Mcgill's wildfire

405
00:24:34,255 --> 00:24:36,389
just took the title away
from the masterful.

406
00:24:36,431 --> 00:24:39,392
Well, now, that's the
kind of dog I can understand.

407
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:42,569
Where is this champion?

408
00:24:42,611 --> 00:24:45,790
Tell him John L. Sullivan would
like to shake him by the hand.

409
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:47,705
That's John L. Sullivan,

410
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,229
a prized fighting champion
of the world.

411
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,511
Now you walk down and look
him right straight in the eye.

412
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:04,765
Wow!

413
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,898
You are the only thing
on earth I've ever seen,

414
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,727
I wouldn't wanna meet in the ring.

415
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:10,989
Put your hand up there, boy.

416
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,993
Come here.

417
00:25:15,035 --> 00:25:16,429
Send him back here
and I'll buy him a drink.

418
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:26,915
- Patch!
- Hi honey

419
00:25:31,268 --> 00:25:34,578
well, what's going on?

420
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,494
If I'm not being too inquisitive.

421
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:40,192
Money's going on, that's what.
Real money.

422
00:25:40,234 --> 00:25:41,933
Ever thought of retiring?

423
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:43,848
Traveling around
the world on boats.

424
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,937
Eating squat at del Monaco's.

425
00:25:45,979 --> 00:25:47,329
Buying your weight in chocolates
or anything you wanted?

426
00:25:47,371 --> 00:25:50,071
Yeah, Patch.

427
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:51,203
Are you in trouble or something?

428
00:25:51,245 --> 00:25:52,944
Trouble?

429
00:25:52,986 --> 00:25:55,294
Why, Mabel honey, you're looking

430
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,426
at the most successful
financial operator on the Bowery.

431
00:25:57,468 --> 00:25:59,777
Yeah, what are you
doing with all my things?

432
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,343
Investing them.

433
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:02,910
Honey, I need capital.

434
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:04,346
Everything I own
and everything you own.

435
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:05,913
We are partners.

436
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:07,741
You bought six more dogs?

437
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:11,049
No, no, nothing like it.

438
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:13,007
This is the only
dog in the world for me.

439
00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,836
Man's best friend.

440
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:17,185
Honey, you remember about

441
00:26:17,227 --> 00:26:19,057
three months ago in the same room

442
00:26:19,099 --> 00:26:19,797
when I told you
opportunity was knocking.

443
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:21,538
Yeah.

444
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,105
Well this time,
it's busting down the door.

445
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:25,977
Honey, this is no dog.

446
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:29,328
He's a walking goldmine.

447
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,417
In fact, I'm thinking
of renaming him. Pay dirt!

448
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:34,289
But he's the champion,

449
00:26:34,331 --> 00:26:36,944
you're makin' money whether...
enh, small potatoes.

450
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:40,426
This is going to
be the real big killing.

451
00:26:40,468 --> 00:26:42,689
Probably mine.

452
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,169
What made this
incredible performance

453
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,040
worth listening to was

454
00:26:46,082 --> 00:26:48,608
that I didn't know
what was up myself.

455
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,915
I was curious as to how
we were all going to retire.

456
00:26:50,957 --> 00:26:51,957
Alive!

457
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,879
- This goes too, uncle.
- Yeah I counted it.

458
00:26:58,921 --> 00:27:00,446
But one thing bothered me.

459
00:27:00,488 --> 00:27:02,840
I couldn't figure out why I,

460
00:27:02,882 --> 00:27:04,885
the champion,
was a five to one underdog.

461
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:07,018
If you'll pardon the expression.

462
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,672
There was something
about this whole thing

463
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,499
that began to give me a chill.

464
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,240
Sorry for your
trouble mister Mcgill.

465
00:27:12,282 --> 00:27:14,068
Nothing to be sorry about, uncle.

466
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,510
This is the happiest
day of my life.

467
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:26,254
Here's my money, Corbin.

468
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:28,039
You can take the bets on it.

469
00:27:28,081 --> 00:27:31,651
I get five-to-one.

470
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,740
Do you really want
to do this, Patch?

471
00:27:33,782 --> 00:27:36,003
Why not he's a champion, ain’t he?

472
00:27:36,045 --> 00:27:36,917
Well, the champion
take on all comers?

473
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,353
In his class, yes.

474
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,660
But not destruction.

475
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:44,011
A good big man can always
beat a good little man.

476
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:46,013
Destruction is good.

477
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:47,275
And besides he's a heavy weight.

478
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:48,581
And he'll eat him alive.

479
00:27:48,623 --> 00:27:50,365
Well, what's a little weight.

480
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:52,977
I'll take skill
over weight any day.

481
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,544
It's you who do the talking.

482
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:57,851
But it the little
one will do the fighting.

483
00:27:57,893 --> 00:28:00,158
I don't seem to recall your face,

484
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,986
but put your money up
if you wanna talk with me.

485
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:05,380
I earn my own money,
I don't have dogs do it for me.

486
00:28:05,422 --> 00:28:07,644
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen,
settle down, settle down.

487
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,386
I'll take your money
and I'll arrange the bets.

488
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,824
Well, you know,
there's something about him

489
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:14,866
that a man has to like.

490
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:30,971
This is the one where
we get rich, so make it quick.

491
00:28:31,013 --> 00:28:33,365
Here comes destruction.

492
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,729
This was quite
a dog I had to lick.

493
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:51,905
He looked as if he had
been sired by the devil.

494
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,820
And bred to the killing of tigers.

495
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,954
His mouth was as big as my head.

496
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:59,521
Looked like a freight
train with ears.

497
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,349
Don't let him bother you,
wildfire.

498
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:05,310
He's a pushover,
slow muscle-bound.

499
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,704
Why I know three cats who
licked him in the past month.

500
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,184
All he's got is an ugly face.

501
00:29:10,226 --> 00:29:11,533
Just don't look at it.

502
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:13,535
Go get him, wildfire.

503
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:16,277
I was sure gonna try.

504
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:18,715
Not for Patch Mcgill
and his miserable money but

505
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,804
there's something called my life.

506
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,675
Maybe I was selfish.

507
00:29:22,717 --> 00:29:24,633
But I kinda enjoyed livin'!

508
00:29:24,675 --> 00:29:26,766
Quiet, gentlemen, quiet.

509
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:29,160
The betting is now closed.

510
00:29:29,202 --> 00:29:32,119
And the fight will
be underway in a minute.

511
00:29:32,161 --> 00:29:35,470
Now as this fight
is exclusively for money

512
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:37,342
we'll forget the formalities.

513
00:29:37,384 --> 00:29:38,778
Ready, destruction?

514
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,738
Ready.

515
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,652
Ready, wildfire?

516
00:29:43,694 --> 00:29:45,350
Ready.

517
00:29:50,614 --> 00:29:53,184
Fight!

518
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:12,290
Cur! A sneaking yellow
live red street dog cur.

519
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:14,074
Could've beaten him if you tried.

520
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:16,597
E tu, brute.

521
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,387
Fed you and housed you
and nursed you like a king.

522
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:23,344
And now you put your tail between

523
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:25,172
your legs and sold me out.

524
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,132
Everything I worked
hard for is gone.

525
00:30:28,174 --> 00:30:32,179
You mean everything he worked
for and I worked for is gone.

526
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:33,354
You never worked an
honest day in your life.

527
00:30:33,396 --> 00:30:35,530
Shut up!

528
00:30:35,572 --> 00:30:38,838
That dog's got more character
than you'll ever have.

529
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,667
It was the first kind thing
anyone said to me all day.

530
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:44,365
I felt like waging my tail.

531
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,107
Except that I was hanging
from it at that time.

532
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:54,941
So long Patch, and don't
ever come near me again.

533
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:58,684
And just to make sure you don't,

534
00:30:58,726 --> 00:31:03,297
I'm going to marry a policeman.

535
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,430
It's all your fault, you mongrel.

536
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,085
I had about one bite left in me.

537
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:10,869
And I found the perfect
place to use it.

538
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:19,183
I could hardly see.

539
00:31:19,225 --> 00:31:20,619
And my legs felt like
I'd borrowed them

540
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:24,014
from some other dog.

541
00:31:24,056 --> 00:31:26,581
But I knew I was
through in the Bowery.

542
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:28,263
I'd better get out
when I was still alive.

543
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:04,881
Right back where I started from,
the waterfront.

544
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,188
A whole year had gone.

545
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,798
I was just as far from finding
my mother or my father.

546
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:22,594
I was too tired to think.

547
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:25,118
I only wanted to lie down,

548
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,599
close my eyes and
forget the whole world.

549
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,558
Maybe forever.

550
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,649
What was the use of anything.

551
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,347
Sometimes I wish the dog catchers

552
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:37,652
and caught me a long time ago.

553
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,078
You'll probably saying to yourself

554
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,907
who is this ugly old devil?

555
00:33:14,949 --> 00:33:16,996
That's exactly what
I was saying to myself.

556
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,303
Nolan is the name.

557
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,567
Jeremiah Edward
Emmett Augustus Nolan

558
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:25,483
I take care of all
the animals around here.

559
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:28,312
I'll admit most of them cantake
better care of themselves,

560
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:32,055
if they're just left alone.

561
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,752
There.

562
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:36,885
Horse meat, horse meat.

563
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:39,105
Shouldn't be too tough though.

564
00:33:39,147 --> 00:33:42,326
His last race he
had finished second.

565
00:33:42,368 --> 00:33:45,416
If it runs out the
money we don't serve it.

566
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,462
That's the kind of
fancy estate this is.

567
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:52,684
Here is what's your
doctor ordered for you.

568
00:33:52,726 --> 00:33:56,993
It eases the pain
it prevents infection,

569
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,867
and he gives me a chance
to get a clearer view.

570
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:05,566
Well, eat a little, sleep a little

571
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,699
and then we'll
see about the future.

572
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:09,875
But don't get lonesome now.

573
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:13,487
If you do, don't bark.
No, I'll be back eventually.

574
00:34:13,529 --> 00:34:16,273
Oh and most important of all,

575
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:19,276
under no circumstances
leave this room.

576
00:34:19,318 --> 00:34:22,192
The terrible tempting
is to run back home

577
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:25,891
and that can only mean trouble
for man and beast alike.

578
00:34:25,933 --> 00:34:28,285
I liked him.

579
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,547
He was the first man I'd met in

580
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:31,070
months who treated me like a dog.

581
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,420
I still didn't know where I was

582
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:36,728
but it seem like a nice,
clean, friendly, quiet place.

583
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,346
I told you to have my
daughter meet me, she didn't.

584
00:34:46,388 --> 00:34:49,088
I asked her to send
the gray mare, she didn't.

585
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,482
I asked the gardener's to
trim the hedges, they didn't!

586
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:53,875
No one, I'm tired of trying!

587
00:34:53,917 --> 00:34:57,227
All of you get up to
the big house in an hour.

588
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,661
Well, it was a clean place anyway.

589
00:35:11,587 --> 00:35:13,330
The next day I had
my appetite back

590
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,549
and felt like an animal again.

591
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,030
Nolan was showing me around.

592
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,946
I've lived here almost
since I was a boy.

593
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:22,208
I know every foot of it.

594
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:26,386
Alright dear.

595
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:29,520
That's where he lives, Mr.
Wyndham.

596
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,697
He's got everything
in the world but peace.

597
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:36,266
So stay out of his sight,
wildfire.

598
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:42,228
Until he comes back to being
the old Wyndham he used to be.

599
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,839
I'm presuming of course that
you'd like to stay around here.

600
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:47,538
Would you like to be Nolan's dog?

601
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:50,541
Could you've said no to
a man with a face like that?

602
00:35:50,583 --> 00:35:53,544
If you could, you re a better dog
then I am gunga din!

603
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:57,330
Course if you do stay you won'tbe
the only dog on the premises.

604
00:35:57,372 --> 00:36:01,552
Oh! No,
no, no. See those buildings?

605
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:05,338
They are the kennels,
Wyndham's special pride.

606
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,949
One of my jobs is to see that

607
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,865
those dogs live better than I do.

608
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:13,433
They are Saint Bernards.

609
00:36:13,475 --> 00:36:14,869
Ever seen a Saint Bernard?

610
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:17,872
No, probably not.

611
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:22,050
They are kind of like
draft horses with racoon coats.

612
00:36:22,092 --> 00:36:24,314
Only the fact that
they're named after a Saint

613
00:36:24,356 --> 00:36:26,881
prevents me from telling you
what I really think about them.

614
00:36:26,923 --> 00:36:28,883
Well, Nolan.
What do you got there?

615
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,669
A dog, as you can plainly see.

616
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,758
A white dog,
should you be colorblind.

617
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,239
Wildfire.

618
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:39,459
Wildfire!
Theson of the pits, a fighting dog.

619
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:41,635
Retired.

620
00:36:41,677 --> 00:36:43,594
What do you think of him, tattle?

621
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,944
Not what I think
of him that counts but

622
00:36:45,986 --> 00:36:47,902
what the old man thinks of him.

623
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,730
Well, I'll keep him out
of his sight for a while.

624
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:52,168
Yeah you're better.

625
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,821
The old man will throw
another one of his fits if

626
00:36:53,863 --> 00:36:55,780
he found a fighting
dog hanging around here.

627
00:36:55,822 --> 00:36:57,999
He might even get
a little mad at you.

628
00:36:58,041 --> 00:37:00,045
So he might.

629
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,874
You're the boss,
Nolan, you tell him.

630
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:05,398
You make him like it
whether he wants to or not.

631
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,965
Do me one favor though.

632
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,272
And what would that be, tattle?

633
00:37:09,314 --> 00:37:13,189
Just tell me where
you want the flowers sent.

634
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:20,457
Boy, that's a mean dog, Nolan.

635
00:37:20,499 --> 00:37:24,330
No sense of humor.

636
00:37:24,372 --> 00:37:27,246
Probably kill somebody
before he's finished.

637
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:30,118
I had been called
mean and vicious before

638
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,252
but nobody ever accused me
of not having a sense of humor.

639
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,776
I was prepared to
dislike mister tattle.

640
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:39,389
Now never mind, Tom tattle.

641
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:43,654
He is just young, full
of young talk and big ideas.

642
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:46,047
He's right about one thing though.

643
00:37:46,089 --> 00:37:48,006
You've got to keep out of

644
00:37:48,048 --> 00:37:49,529
sight for a while down here
in the barn

645
00:37:49,571 --> 00:37:51,183
whatever you do wildfire,

646
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:54,012
at whatever cost,

647
00:37:54,054 --> 00:37:57,320
stay away from those
Saint Bernard kennels.

648
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:00,192
Naturally when I had the chance

649
00:38:00,234 --> 00:38:03,543
where do you think was
the first place I went!

650
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:04,585
You re right!

651
00:38:08,547 --> 00:38:11,421
Those with dogs?

652
00:38:11,463 --> 00:38:13,031
They must put
something in the food!

653
00:38:13,073 --> 00:38:15,338
The puppies were
bigger than I was!

654
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,122
And the way they lived.

655
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:20,647
Like one my
early dreams of heaven.

656
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,259
Saint Bernards!

657
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,436
For saints their commons
left much to be desired.

658
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:36,791
Quiet!

659
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,366
That's when I heard a voice.

660
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:46,151
Unmistakably British it said,

661
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:47,553
'in here old chap
and shake a leg'.

662
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:01,340
It took all my self
control to sit there

663
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,863
staring into a face
that looked like something

664
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:05,170
that fell off a totem pole.

665
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:07,259
But as it turned out

666
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:09,870
he had a kinda style
about him grew on you.

667
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,394
Said his name was Jimmy jocks.

668
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:13,091
And he was the housekeeper

669
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,745
of mister Wyndham's daughter,
miss Dorothy.

670
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:16,137
Speaking of Mr. Wyndham...

671
00:39:16,179 --> 00:39:17,922
Where did that white dog go,

672
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:19,010
the one that was attacking
the Saint Bernards.

673
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:20,359
He just disappeared, Mr. Wyndham.

674
00:39:20,401 --> 00:39:21,882
Did
you see him, Nolan?

675
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:24,232
I saw no dog attacking
the Saint Bernards.

676
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,147
Well I did.
Findhim and get him off this estate.

677
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:27,714
I don't care how you do it.

678
00:39:27,756 --> 00:39:29,760
This isn't a home
for stray mongrels.

679
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:31,631
Oh, I am sure he is harmless,
Mr. Wyndham.

680
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:33,154
And I'm sure I don't
need your advice, Mr. Nolan.

681
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:34,276
Just find them before I do.

682
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:39,944
You re not crazy enough

683
00:39:39,986 --> 00:39:42,207
to think you keeping that
fine fighting dog, are you?

684
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:43,817
What if do?

685
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,037
Just thinking
of you, Nolan.

686
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,301
You're too old to take
a chance at getting fired.

687
00:39:49,343 --> 00:39:50,868
Tattle,
the reason I'm been about here

688
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,478
as long as I have

689
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,046
is because when I was your age

690
00:39:55,088 --> 00:39:57,744
I was working hard instead
of talking so much.

691
00:39:57,786 --> 00:40:00,530
- Now let's get busy.
- Sure, Nolan.

692
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:02,096
I guess I can ever
hope to be as smart as you

693
00:40:02,138 --> 00:40:04,011
until I am a real old man.

694
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:06,536
Take it easy, old timer.

695
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,451
And if you do get
cut blame it on me.

696
00:40:08,493 --> 00:40:09,493
I can handle Wyndham.

697
00:40:15,456 --> 00:40:18,809
That Tom tattle
made my hackles rise.

698
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:22,160
Well anyway I head out for
a couple hours with Jimmy jocks.

699
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:25,250
What a big brain that jocks was!

700
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:28,296
These words I never
heard people say.

701
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:30,560
He had been all over
the world and seen everything.

702
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:32,953
Wonderful things like,

703
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:37,175
perfumed French poodles
and Chinese fire hydrants.

704
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,457
We struck up quite a friendship

705
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,925
Jocks didn't care much
for the Saint Bernards.

706
00:40:47,967 --> 00:40:49,230
But at the same time
he didn't want to

707
00:40:49,272 --> 00:40:51,624
tangle with one in a fight.

708
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,586
You'd have to be a furrier
to find their throats.

709
00:40:56,018 --> 00:40:58,414
The things that Jimmy
jocks taught me...

710
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,112
Did you know that dogs
were here before people?

711
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:04,550
That we invented such
well known phrases as, 'puppy love',

712
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:08,075
'putting on the dog'
and 'bulldog determination'.

713
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:11,207
That my Latin name is,
now get this, cannis familiaris.

714
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,084
Things Jimmy jocks showed me.

715
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,154
One day the sun was warm

716
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:47,332
and the air smelled like a
department store at Christmas.

717
00:41:47,374 --> 00:41:48,986
And we had just polished off about

718
00:41:49,028 --> 00:41:51,467
half a crate of Wyndham's
finest strawberries.

719
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,513
Jocks was in a good mood.

720
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:56,863
Expansive, he'd have said.

721
00:41:56,905 --> 00:41:58,865
He told me I reminded him about

722
00:41:58,907 --> 00:42:02,173
great terrier named
'champion regent royal'.

723
00:42:02,215 --> 00:42:04,218
That was my father's name.

724
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,265
Champion regent royal.

725
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,397
No wonder I never found
him on the Bowery.

726
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,748
He was no fighting dog at all,

727
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:14,749
but a different kind
of a champion, a show dog.

728
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:18,972
Jocks then took me to a place

729
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:21,584
I'd never seen or heard of before.

730
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:24,325
It was called the trophy room.

731
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:27,503
After jocks left I stayed
there a long time alone.

732
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,287
Looking at the prizes won by dogs

733
00:42:29,329 --> 00:42:31,811
of the most superior breeding.

734
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:33,900
I thought about my father,

735
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:36,816
the most superior of them all.

736
00:42:36,858 --> 00:42:38,862
I knew now I'd never
get close to him.

737
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:39,944
He lived in another world.

738
00:42:49,218 --> 00:42:50,961
I Don't know who you are,

739
00:42:51,003 --> 00:42:53,790
but you couldn't stand that
way unless it was bred into you.

740
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:56,444
You must be one of Mr.
Crawford's new terriers.

741
00:42:56,486 --> 00:43:00,318
If you are, he's certainly
improving his stock.

742
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,538
Don't tighten up, I just
want to get a good look at.

743
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,192
Oh, I know,

744
00:43:05,234 --> 00:43:07,594
I'll bet you are the white dog
father was complaining about.

745
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,771
Holy Toledo!
Three of them.

746
00:43:18,813 --> 00:43:21,774
Jimmy jocks!
They will kill him!

747
00:43:21,816 --> 00:43:23,167
My only hope was that
they fought like gentlemen,

748
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:24,734
because I didn't.

749
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:45,668
It's alright, Jimmy, it's alright.

750
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,017
It's alright, Jimmy.

751
00:43:47,059 --> 00:43:48,845
Do I shoot him now

752
00:43:48,887 --> 00:43:50,586
or would you rather do it down
by the stable?

753
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,848
Father, three of
those monsters attacked

754
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:53,632
poor little Jimmy jocks.

755
00:43:53,674 --> 00:43:54,764
They would have killed...
these are three of most valuable

756
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:56,461
Saint Bernard's in the world.

757
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,028
And I don't intend to have
any stray mongrel tearing

758
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,986
at their throats.

759
00:44:00,028 --> 00:44:02,206
Come on,
Nolan, let's get it over with.

760
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:04,251
I'll be no party to the
shooting of a defenseless dog.

761
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:06,819
Well then I'll do it myself.

762
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,430
Father, stop talking
like Simon Legree!

763
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:10,431
Well, it's interesting
to see what kind of people

764
00:44:10,473 --> 00:44:11,955
I have working for me.

765
00:44:11,997 --> 00:44:14,348
Well after 40 years
you should know.

766
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,046
Why don't you tell them
whose dog it is, Nolan.

767
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:17,830
It's my dog, sir.

768
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,876
I brought him in as a stable-pit.

769
00:44:19,918 --> 00:44:22,835
He's a fine animal, sir.
A pit-dog.

770
00:44:22,877 --> 00:44:24,750
A fighting dog a trained killer?

771
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,883
No longer, sir.

772
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:29,102
He's intelligent, has a good heart

773
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:30,234
and we've become friends.

774
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:32,323
In the future

775
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:35,369
I'll see that he gives you
no cause for further trouble.

776
00:44:35,411 --> 00:44:39,025
Well, you get rid of him in
one hour or I'll shoot him on sight.

777
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,420
The dog will be out in an hour.

778
00:44:42,462 --> 00:44:47,164
And I'll go with him.

779
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:48,731
Father what's the matter with
you? He might really leave.

780
00:44:48,773 --> 00:44:50,384
Let him.

781
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:52,909
Let him think of
himself and his job

782
00:44:52,951 --> 00:44:54,258
if he wants to waste
it on a street dog.

783
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,477
Let him.

784
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:57,914
Put those Saint Bernards back
in the kennel.

785
00:44:57,956 --> 00:45:02,700
Come on, boy,
come on, come on, let's go.

786
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:10,840
I'm not overloaded with
conscience but I found a friend.

787
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:12,493
I couldn't see letting
them lose a lifetime job over

788
00:45:12,535 --> 00:45:15,540
a drifter like me.

789
00:45:15,582 --> 00:45:19,805
No, no, no.

790
00:45:19,847 --> 00:45:24,288
You don't have to be a martyr,
go running off to save me.

791
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:27,465
You don't realize it, of course.

792
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:30,860
But it's not your fault
that all this has happened.

793
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:34,167
How do you like that?

794
00:45:34,209 --> 00:45:37,605
Not only does this guy treat me
better than anybody I ever met.

795
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:39,259
But for the third or fourth time,

796
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:42,175
this is exactly what I'm thinking.

797
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:45,875
I wonder if somewhere
back in his family tree...

798
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:49,313
no, no, it was too improbable.

799
00:45:49,355 --> 00:45:52,011
But still...

800
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:54,187
you know, wildfire.

801
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:57,930
Mister Wyndham is a self made man.

802
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:00,628
He Rose from the waterfront
all by his own ingenuity

803
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:02,761
and the sweat of his brow.

804
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:07,723
Yes, like everybody in America,

805
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:09,897
he had the dream of getting ahead.

806
00:46:17,122 --> 00:46:20,474
You get to a day,
when you can sit back,

807
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:24,435
take it easy and enjoy
the fruits of your labour,

808
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:28,700
immaterial things and friendships.

809
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:35,707
And most important
of all the luxury of time.

810
00:46:35,749 --> 00:46:37,665
Time to do all the
little personal things

811
00:46:37,707 --> 00:46:39,450
you've always wanted to do.

812
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:43,367
Like reading the classics,

813
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:47,588
trying to grow a blue Rose,

814
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,767
learning about
good wine and may be,

815
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,553
doing something foolish,
just for the fun of it.

816
00:46:55,595 --> 00:46:57,903
Well, after working
all through his life

817
00:46:57,945 --> 00:47:00,427
to the day when he
could enjoy himself,

818
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:03,779
he suddenly collapsed.

819
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,564
With a heart attack.

820
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:11,177
He's had four in
the past two years.

821
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:16,661
Yes, those business trips
were in truth trips to a clinic.

822
00:47:16,703 --> 00:47:19,272
If he has another attack

823
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:24,234
he could die...
Tomorrow or next week.

824
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:28,194
Or next year.

825
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:30,240
I'm the only one who
knows of his misfortune

826
00:47:30,282 --> 00:47:33,983
and that bothers him too.

827
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:37,595
I am a source of irritation to him

828
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:41,512
and every time we get
together we seem to argue.

829
00:47:41,554 --> 00:47:43,644
I don't want to live myself

830
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:45,472
to see the day he drops dead

831
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:48,258
in one of those arguments.

832
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,868
So, it's best I go.

833
00:47:57,396 --> 00:48:01,401
That's the third Brandy
you've had in 10 minutes.

834
00:48:01,443 --> 00:48:07,668
No, no,
it's the sixth in 20 minutes.

835
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,888
What's the use of a
man working hard all his life

836
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:11,629
to be able to buy the best
Brandy if he can't drink it.

837
00:48:11,671 --> 00:48:15,328
But father...

838
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,505
Dorothy, I'll drink what
I want, when I want it.

839
00:48:18,547 --> 00:48:20,159
And do what you want,
and scream when you want,

840
00:48:20,201 --> 00:48:22,945
and be bullheaded when you want.

841
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:26,078
Well I hardly have the time
to live my life for a dog handler.

842
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:30,474
Or a daughter?

843
00:48:30,516 --> 00:48:32,780
I'll run this house and
this estate the way I want to.

844
00:48:32,822 --> 00:48:36,959
Well, I bought it and built
it and I paid for it.

845
00:48:37,001 --> 00:48:40,179
I thought you built it for mother.

846
00:48:40,221 --> 00:48:44,270
It was hers when she was here.

847
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:47,099
Father ask Nolan to stay.

848
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:49,058
- Absolutely not.
- I'll ask him for you.

849
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,711
He had no right
to bring a dog here,

850
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:52,670
especially a street mongrel.

851
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:57,109
A pit-dog, trained to kill
other animals before their time.

852
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:59,546
But that dog isn't a mongrel.

853
00:48:59,588 --> 00:49:01,157
You didn't see him posing

854
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:02,854
in front of the
trophy room mirror.

855
00:49:02,896 --> 00:49:05,901
He looked like royalty.

856
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,076
Well, I could enter
that dog in a show

857
00:49:07,118 --> 00:49:08,816
and win a ribbon with him.

858
00:49:08,858 --> 00:49:09,858
You...

859
00:49:12,514 --> 00:49:15,780
I bet you $50 that you couldn't,

860
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:18,087
I bet you $50 you couldn't
even win the third prize.

861
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:20,176
Or if that pooch could win

862
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:25,529
the booby price,
I'd give up drinking.

863
00:49:25,571 --> 00:49:27,531
I'll make you an even more
interesting bet than that.

864
00:49:27,573 --> 00:49:30,447
How interesting?

865
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:37,193
If he wins a ribbon,
both he and Nolan stay.

866
00:49:37,235 --> 00:49:40,020
Daughter, that's a bet.

867
00:49:44,633 --> 00:49:46,506
I had about as much chance

868
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:48,378
at winning a ribbon in a dog show,

869
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,207
as I had of swimming
the English channel

870
00:49:51,249 --> 00:49:53,078
maybe less.

871
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,469
There's his mother's boy.

872
00:50:03,304 --> 00:50:04,784
My first shave.

873
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:13,662
No comment!

874
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,021
Some things your best
friends wont tell you.

875
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:25,893
Now, wildfire, let's learn
how to be a real show dog.

876
00:50:25,935 --> 00:50:30,289
It's discipline, boy, discipline.

877
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:33,640
Now assume the position
of a real champion.

878
00:50:33,682 --> 00:50:37,993
Stand up. Up!

879
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:45,957
Alright then you lazy
thing just stay there.

880
00:50:45,999 --> 00:50:48,264
Well, well maybe you can point,
like a hunter.

881
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:49,613
Point.

882
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:51,963
Point at what?

883
00:50:52,005 --> 00:50:53,441
Besides pointing ain't polite.

884
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,840
Stand up!

885
00:50:59,882 --> 00:51:02,756
Hey fellas, after all

886
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:05,020
you can't make a fencing
mask out of a steely door.

887
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,371
Well, that's a little better.

888
00:51:08,413 --> 00:51:12,592
Oh, you aren't trying hard enough.

889
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:15,291
And don't try to make
up it won't do you any good.

890
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18,946
Terrible, it's terrible.

891
00:51:18,988 --> 00:51:23,473
So it was terrible, sue me.

892
00:51:23,515 --> 00:51:26,041
Special foods to fortify me,

893
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:28,652
build me up and
make my coat shine.

894
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,002
Breathing exercises
and how to walk.

895
00:51:31,044 --> 00:51:33,613
Six weeks for junk like that

896
00:51:33,655 --> 00:51:35,015
but two good reasons
kept me going.

897
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,360
Just won't let me be friends.

898
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:45,451
He's a little nervous and edgy,
he'll get used to you.

899
00:51:45,493 --> 00:51:47,801
What a crazy thing to do.

900
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:50,108
Betting your job this
mutt will win a ribbon.

901
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:54,373
The bet was no choice of mine.

902
00:51:54,415 --> 00:51:58,856
I'm turning in.

903
00:51:58,898 --> 00:52:03,165
Nolan...

904
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:06,864
I want you to know I'm sorry
to be taking over your job soon,

905
00:52:06,906 --> 00:52:08,996
but that's life.

906
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:10,278
The old make way for the young.

907
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:21,008
Sorry to take Nolan's job?

908
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,707
If I ever saw a guy happy,
it was tattle.

909
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:25,448
That was the first good reason

910
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:27,928
I had to go through
with the dog show.

911
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,147
Maybe all the other
dogs would drop dead

912
00:52:29,189 --> 00:52:31,236
and might win something.

913
00:52:31,278 --> 00:52:33,978
Nolan can keep his job.

914
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:38,678
And the second reason... him.

915
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,899
He took to standing out
at night and watching me,

916
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:45,337
as if he was trying
to figure something out,

917
00:52:45,379 --> 00:52:46,991
maybe wondering
when he was scheduled

918
00:52:47,033 --> 00:52:49,559
for that last fatal heart attack.

919
00:52:49,601 --> 00:52:51,604
Well maybe he was hoping

920
00:52:51,646 --> 00:52:53,780
Nolan would throw
me out and apologize.

921
00:52:53,822 --> 00:52:56,131
Nolan never would.

922
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,783
The old guy was so honest,
it was stupid.

923
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:21,912
Somehow the day finally came.

924
00:54:21,954 --> 00:54:25,307
And there I was
at my first dog show.

925
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:27,526
I'd seen some pretty
wild specimens in my time.

926
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:30,225
But some of these took the cake.

927
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:32,357
I began to get an
idea of what happened

928
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:34,490
to some of those characters
who didn't know what was up.

929
00:54:34,532 --> 00:54:36,273
They were entered in dog shows.

930
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:48,895
136, is that right?

931
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:51,637
- 136.
- Here, here come on.

932
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,511
- There, in you go.
- Go on in, prince Galahad.

933
00:54:55,553 --> 00:54:58,775
Obviously the wrong cage I hoped.

934
00:54:58,817 --> 00:55:02,516
Prince Galahad, oh no!

935
00:55:04,866 --> 00:55:06,870
Now relax, Galahad.

936
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:08,001
You're as good as any out there.

937
00:55:08,043 --> 00:55:10,613
And don't you forget it.

938
00:55:10,655 --> 00:55:12,919
A lot of things are
riding on you today.

939
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:16,662
My faith, Nolan's job,
and the honor of Wyndham.

940
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:17,923
Now do your best.

941
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,368
All she left out was,
if you need anything bark.

942
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,759
And then it happened.

943
00:55:32,981 --> 00:55:36,465
A dame just swaddled in class.

944
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:40,338
Miss ladyship, the second
of the canford estate.

945
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,602
About three miles she told me
from the Wyndham place.

946
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,344
Well we fell into
some nonchalant chit chat

947
00:55:46,386 --> 00:55:48,564
about fleas and
dog biscuits and such.

948
00:55:48,606 --> 00:55:50,217
It was then that I noticed

949
00:55:50,259 --> 00:55:51,871
something going on
in the front of my cage.

950
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:52,829
Good morning,
miss Wyndham.

951
00:55:52,871 --> 00:55:54,091
Good morning, Mr. Oakley.

952
00:55:54,133 --> 00:55:56,267
- Nolan.
- How do you do, sir?

953
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:57,703
I haven't see
you at any of the shows lately.

954
00:55:57,745 --> 00:55:59,879
Possibly because
I haven't been to many.

955
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:02,317
I see. I didn't know
you were raising bull terriers.

956
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,884
I'm not,

957
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:08,148
this is just one that Nolan
and I happen to... to inherit.

958
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:12,675
Prince Galahad of Wyndham.

959
00:56:12,717 --> 00:56:15,286
You have no parents
listed for him.

960
00:56:15,328 --> 00:56:17,027
Oh, well, you se... unfortunately

961
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:18,420
the records were lost in the fire,

962
00:56:18,462 --> 00:56:20,944
but he comes of a good line.

963
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:21,945
Your word is good
enough for us, Nolan.

964
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:23,207
Thank you, sir.

965
00:56:23,249 --> 00:56:26,036
Let's take a look at him.

966
00:56:26,078 --> 00:56:28,908
What a cornball this guy was.

967
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,476
I could have been a
mongrel for all he cared.

968
00:56:31,518 --> 00:56:32,869
I bet he was he was
just hoping to sneak a look

969
00:56:32,911 --> 00:56:34,392
at miss Dorothy's ankles.

970
00:56:34,434 --> 00:56:35,741
They were pretty well covered up.

971
00:56:35,783 --> 00:56:37,917
Miss Wyndham,

972
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:39,745
you are not seriously
entering this dog in this show.

973
00:56:39,787 --> 00:56:42,313
I certainly am.

974
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:44,359
You don't know much
about this breed, do you?

975
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:46,448
Is it necessary to know anything?

976
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,667
He's a good dog.
I paid my fee and entered him.

977
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:50,539
Miss Wyndham, don't you realize...

978
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:52,628
I'm not interested in your opinion

979
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,412
until he gets up there
on the judging stand.

980
00:56:54,454 --> 00:56:55,935
And if you're angry with me

981
00:56:55,977 --> 00:56:57,377
don't take points
away from the dog.

982
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,771
Miss Wyndham, I'm an honest judge.

983
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:06,813
Above everything.

984
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,691
As if I didn't
have enough troubles,

985
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:15,651
now I was responsible
for a love affair.

986
00:57:15,693 --> 00:57:17,000
The next thing I
expected here was that

987
00:57:17,042 --> 00:57:18,436
if I didn't win a ribbon,

988
00:57:18,478 --> 00:57:19,959
every third baby born in New York

989
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:22,048
would be thrown in east river.

990
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,789
It's enough to make me nervous.

991
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:26,270
Well, good luck in the show,
Galahad.

992
00:57:26,312 --> 00:57:28,925
Here, here's a little something
to keep you from getting hungry.

993
00:57:28,967 --> 00:57:33,973
There, good hunting, chin up.

994
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,149
What I really need was about

995
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:38,271
two shots of rye that
they poured at Corbin's saloon.

996
00:57:40,935 --> 00:57:42,197
Well maybe what I needed was...

997
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:01,479
At least, the flat heads
could have looked

998
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:03,394
at me a little longer.

999
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:06,789
Pretend like I was worth the time.

1000
00:58:06,831 --> 00:58:12,229
It would have made Nolan
and miss Dorothy feel better.

1001
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:13,752
I had a good mind to
take a bite out of that

1002
00:58:13,794 --> 00:58:15,493
imported tweed seat of Oakley's.

1003
00:58:20,192 --> 00:58:22,718
Your attention please,

1004
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,503
third prize in the bull
terrier judging

1005
00:58:25,545 --> 00:58:30,595
miss ladyship, the second
of the conford estate.

1006
00:58:30,637 --> 00:58:33,511
Second place ribbon
goes to cavalier,

1007
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:37,384
of the well brow kennel.

1008
00:58:37,426 --> 00:58:41,737
And the blue ribbon winner,
for best of breed,

1009
00:58:41,779 --> 00:58:44,566
miss Dorothy...

1010
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,128
prince Galahad,
of the Wyndham estates.

1011
00:58:50,483 --> 00:58:52,443
Holy Toledo!

1012
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:54,358
Talk about the fix being on!

1013
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,882
What a phony decision!

1014
00:58:56,924 --> 00:58:58,884
The things a guy
will do for a doll

1015
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:00,190
congratulations, Nolan!

1016
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:01,539
Nolan!

1017
00:59:01,581 --> 00:59:03,846
Oh wonderful, beautiful dog.

1018
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:06,544
If you were a man,
I'd marry you tomorrow.

1019
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:09,808
I could hardly wait
to be reincarnated.

1020
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:11,244
Why you entered prince
Galahad on this local show,

1021
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:12,681
I couldn't understand.

1022
00:59:12,723 --> 00:59:14,552
He was way out of his class.

1023
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:16,162
One look at him
would tell any judge

1024
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:17,033
that he was a winner
before he ever stepped

1025
00:59:17,075 --> 00:59:19,514
into the judging ring.

1026
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:23,387
- Really?
- Really.

1027
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,563
He's the best bull terrier
I've ever seen since...

1028
00:59:25,605 --> 00:59:27,957
Since champion regent royal.

1029
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:31,134
Champion regent royal, my old man.

1030
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:33,919
Even the experts
said he was perfect.

1031
00:59:33,961 --> 00:59:35,791
Well maybe that blue ribbon
I won was really on a level.

1032
00:59:35,833 --> 00:59:38,576
Wildfire Mcgill

1033
00:59:38,618 --> 00:59:41,840
butcher boy of the Bowery
was now prince Galahad Nolan.

1034
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:44,843
Darling of the society
show dog circuit.

1035
00:59:44,885 --> 00:59:48,107
I can hardly wait
to tell Horatio Alger.

1036
00:59:48,149 --> 00:59:49,718
I don't know what to say Mr.
Oakley,

1037
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,112
except that I misjudged you.

1038
00:59:53,154 --> 00:59:55,680
I am sorry.

1039
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:59,205
Oh, that's quite alright,
miss Wyndham.

1040
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:01,381
Will you have lunch with me?

1041
01:00:01,423 --> 01:00:03,906
I'd be delighted.

1042
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:08,301
- Nolan?
- Thank you, sir.

1043
01:00:08,343 --> 01:00:10,913
A more stupid exchange
between two people

1044
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:13,742
obviously in love
you can hardly imagine!

1045
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:16,179
It comes from too much education,

1046
01:00:16,221 --> 01:00:18,529
reading love novels written
by al mead spinsters.

1047
01:00:18,571 --> 01:00:20,531
Now on the Bowery

1048
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:22,489
she would've kissed
him and lifted his wallet.

1049
01:00:22,531 --> 01:00:25,188
And he'd have gotten
roaring drunk on credit.

1050
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,016
And beat up every man
that as much as looked at her.

1051
01:00:27,058 --> 01:00:30,759
Now that's real love.

1052
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:34,676
Well I'm as surprised
as you are that he did so well.

1053
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:37,635
I just wondered if we
could set him up in a kennel.

1054
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,028
There is one empty.

1055
01:00:39,070 --> 01:00:40,595
He could get good care

1056
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,640
like the other...
no, no absolutely not.

1057
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:44,424
No, he's still nothing
but a street dog.

1058
01:00:44,466 --> 01:00:45,034
Get him off the table.

1059
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:47,427
Father!

1060
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:50,126
Down wildfire.

1061
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:51,344
Well you were something
of a street dog yourself,

1062
01:00:51,386 --> 01:00:52,476
sir, once, weren't you?

1063
01:00:52,518 --> 01:00:54,913
Nolan, so help me out,

1064
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:55,697
get rid of...
Father, he's in the right

1065
01:00:55,739 --> 01:00:57,612
to be taken care of.

1066
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,657
I don't need anybody
to take care of me.

1067
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:02,181
I was talking about the dog.

1068
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:03,879
He has better manners
than both of you.

1069
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,228
And what must he do to satisfy

1070
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:06,838
you win the grand national?

1071
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,014
Oh shucks!

1072
01:01:09,056 --> 01:01:11,756
Winning the
neighborhood dog show...

1073
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:12,714
George Oakley would
give you the world

1074
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:15,499
if you smiled at him.

1075
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:18,415
Hardly qualifies this Bari
tramp as the champion.

1076
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:19,851
Father George Oakley
didn't give me those ribbons,

1077
01:01:19,893 --> 01:01:22,245
there were two other judges.

1078
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:23,899
And George said he is
the most perfect bullterrier

1079
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:25,552
he's seen since
champion regent royal.

1080
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:27,424
That name again.

1081
01:01:27,466 --> 01:01:28,599
The son of men who want to get in

1082
01:01:28,641 --> 01:01:30,732
this plan again myself.

1083
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,472
You're the most stubborn
man I've ever known.

1084
01:01:32,514 --> 01:01:34,387
Well please, miss Dorothy

1085
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:37,216
I'm sure he doesn't mean to...
He's been like this for a year

1086
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:39,610
shouting, criticizing, hating
everything he doesn't own.

1087
01:01:39,652 --> 01:01:41,917
Well you don't own this dog.

1088
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:43,875
And before Nolan and
I are through with him,

1089
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:46,356
you're going to be begging
for a chance to hold his leash.

1090
01:01:46,398 --> 01:01:47,923
He's going to win
the grand nationals

1091
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:48,965
at Madison square garden.

1092
01:01:55,886 --> 01:01:58,237
Whenever I went outside
for some air at night

1093
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:00,370
I could almost always
count on him being there.

1094
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,546
Watching me.

1095
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:05,723
We all had our problems,

1096
01:02:05,765 --> 01:02:08,987
but it came to me that
Wyndham's was the biggest one of all.

1097
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:10,902
He couldn't hate everybody

1098
01:02:10,944 --> 01:02:13,078
and everything as
much as he pretended.

1099
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,254
He was a self-made man

1100
01:02:15,296 --> 01:02:17,692
and that was something
I could appreciate.

1101
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,999
So I decided to
stick my neck way up.

1102
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:23,041
If I get chopped off
I can only say I asked for it.

1103
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:36,857
Would you care to go for a walk?

1104
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:53,771
We walked for about
10 to 15 minutes.

1105
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:56,121
He didn't say a word.

1106
01:02:56,163 --> 01:02:59,472
Once in a while he
just look down on me.

1107
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:01,714
As if he was trying to make
up his mind about something.

1108
01:03:11,265 --> 01:03:13,573
What do you know?

1109
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:15,184
The old boy was so
sure I'd go with him,

1110
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:19,666
he had a couple
a dog biscuits ready.

1111
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:22,757
Well I hear you were quite a dog.

1112
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:28,327
The terror of the Bowery,
wasn't that it?

1113
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:30,416
Taking a chance on getting
killed twice a week,

1114
01:03:30,458 --> 01:03:34,856
just to keep a Bowery
barman's spending money.

1115
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,858
Does life mean that little to you?

1116
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,555
Of course, I couldn't answer.

1117
01:03:38,597 --> 01:03:40,557
But if I could.

1118
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:43,473
I would have said that
dogs are no different from men.

1119
01:03:43,515 --> 01:03:46,258
They do what they
can to stay alive.

1120
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,521
And when they run out
of cleverness or courage,

1121
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:49,913
one day they turn up dead.

1122
01:03:54,961 --> 01:04:02,057
Pit-dog, huh? A fighter.

1123
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:04,102
You know what it means
to suddenly face death,

1124
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:06,409
don't you?

1125
01:04:06,451 --> 01:04:10,065
Doesn't seem to bother
you in the slightest.

1126
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:11,109
It occurred to me
maybe there's something

1127
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:16,419
that I could learn from you.

1128
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:18,682
What's a man come
to when the only one you...

1129
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:23,948
Let himself look
to for help is a dog.

1130
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,252
Come on, boy.
Come on.

1131
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:37,048
Get him.
Get him out of there.

1132
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:40,356
Get him.

1133
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:44,403
Come on.

1134
01:04:44,445 --> 01:04:46,362
We walked for miles.

1135
01:04:46,404 --> 01:04:48,233
And I listened
to him talk for hours

1136
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:50,540
no one ever noticed this.

1137
01:04:50,582 --> 01:04:53,195
And I got this to say about him,

1138
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:55,806
underneath all that
shouting and bluff,

1139
01:04:55,848 --> 01:04:58,113
he was as great
a guy as I'd ever met.

1140
01:04:58,155 --> 01:05:00,376
He wasn't afraid of dying.

1141
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:02,726
His mind was so full
of life and ideas.

1142
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:04,597
But he felt cheated because

1143
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:09,472
his body was short
changing him with time.

1144
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:10,914
That was a pleasant
evening old boy.

1145
01:05:17,304 --> 01:05:18,653
Why Don't you go to bed?

1146
01:05:31,405 --> 01:05:33,888
But I had problems of my own.

1147
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:35,541
I just couldn't get
that miss ladyship,

1148
01:05:35,583 --> 01:05:41,243
the second, outta my mind.

1149
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:44,811
It was 3 miles to the canford
estate as the crow flies.

1150
01:05:44,853 --> 01:05:48,511
Unfortunately I was born a dog.

1151
01:05:48,553 --> 01:05:51,557
Over hill and Dale.
Through shot and shell.

1152
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:53,472
Anything for love.

1153
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:09,575
Dames, they want
you to climb mountains,

1154
01:06:09,617 --> 01:06:12,709
swim oceans, go through fire.

1155
01:06:12,751 --> 01:06:14,493
When you finally get there,
they say

1156
01:06:14,535 --> 01:06:19,846
why don't you go home clean up.

1157
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:22,371
But you can always tell.

1158
01:06:22,413 --> 01:06:25,374
Sometimes they change their mind.

1159
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:26,591
Oh, well.

1160
01:06:39,908 --> 01:06:42,130
Two weeks went by like that,

1161
01:06:42,172 --> 01:06:45,524
I never got any sleep or any rest.

1162
01:06:45,566 --> 01:06:49,006
I suddenly found my life
belong to a 24-hour company

1163
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:51,356
called 'the Wyndham-
miss ladyship-

1164
01:06:51,398 --> 01:06:54,707
Nolan-miss Dorothy-corporation'.

1165
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:57,317
Buyers and sellers of
that miracle product wildfire.

1166
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:18,470
Come on, boy.

1167
01:07:18,512 --> 01:07:19,732
You've slept long enough we've
got a hard day ahead of us.

1168
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:21,646
Oh, Nolan.

1169
01:07:24,475 --> 01:07:28,045
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know.

1170
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,395
- He must be sick.
- Sick?

1171
01:07:30,437 --> 01:07:32,832
No temperature, no infection.

1172
01:07:32,874 --> 01:07:35,531
Maybe he is homesick
for something.

1173
01:07:35,573 --> 01:07:37,098
Where he came from
I can surprisingly say that

1174
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:38,619
he never want to go back.

1175
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:45,454
- I know!
- What?

1176
01:07:45,496 --> 01:07:49,153
He's in love.

1177
01:07:49,195 --> 01:07:50,981
Why don't you say he wants to
study the piano

1178
01:07:51,023 --> 01:07:52,635
or something sensible.

1179
01:07:52,677 --> 01:07:54,158
Well, he has all the symptoms.

1180
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,117
And who would he be in love with?

1181
01:07:56,159 --> 01:07:58,075
The queen of Romania?

1182
01:07:58,117 --> 01:08:00,643
I don't know but look at him.

1183
01:08:00,685 --> 01:08:02,036
Do you know what's
really wrong with him?

1184
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,690
Worms!

1185
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:07,737
An inferiority complex.

1186
01:08:07,779 --> 01:08:09,304
He probably thinks
a dog from the Bowery

1187
01:08:09,346 --> 01:08:11,567
has no right in
Madison square garden.

1188
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:15,005
- Now who's talking nonsense!
- Isn't it odd?

1189
01:08:15,047 --> 01:08:17,181
Neither one of them
was talking nonsense.

1190
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:20,184
They both hit it
right on the head.

1191
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:23,144
It was enough to make
me feel ashamed of myself.

1192
01:08:23,186 --> 01:08:25,407
I sure wish that I could
find my mother somewhere.

1193
01:08:25,449 --> 01:08:27,757
She'd make me feel better.

1194
01:08:27,799 --> 01:08:30,673
You know, sometimes I wonder
if we're not being foolish.

1195
01:08:30,715 --> 01:08:33,284
Even if he gets in the
big dog show in the garden.

1196
01:08:33,326 --> 01:08:35,721
You know who he has to face,
Don't you?!

1197
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:39,508
Champion regent royal.

1198
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:43,294
That's the news
I was waiting to hear.

1199
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:45,688
Suddenly I felt great.

1200
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,472
The world wasn't
big enough to hold me.

1201
01:08:47,514 --> 01:08:49,953
What a wonderful feeling.

1202
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:52,129
I was finally gonna get my chance

1203
01:08:52,171 --> 01:08:53,171
to kill my father.

1204
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,613
Come here, boy.
Come on.

1205
01:08:57,655 --> 01:09:00,224
Bring it here, boy.

1206
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:05,011
Come here, boy. Yeah.
Come on, boy. Come on, here.

1207
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:09,799
Go inside.

1208
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:11,234
Go on.

1209
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:38,044
I see you and the
old man out for a walk

1210
01:09:38,086 --> 01:09:40,830
that's good.

1211
01:09:40,872 --> 01:09:44,138
The old fella needs
somebody to talk to.

1212
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,487
You're quite a dog, wildfire.

1213
01:09:45,529 --> 01:09:50,144
Quite a dog.

1214
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,407
Why Don't we be friends, huh?

1215
01:09:54,842 --> 01:10:00,241
Okay, I don't have
Nolan's touch with dogs.

1216
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:02,417
Maybe I did something.

1217
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:05,289
They just sore at me,
I don't know.

1218
01:10:05,331 --> 01:10:08,292
Can't hold it against
me forever, can ya?

1219
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:12,427
I made a mistake, I admit it.

1220
01:10:12,469 --> 01:10:14,559
Come on shake.

1221
01:10:14,601 --> 01:10:17,997
I didn't like that tattooed
smile on tattle's face.

1222
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:19,695
The guy was trying
so hard to be friendly.

1223
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:20,826
What could I do?

1224
01:10:20,868 --> 01:10:24,656
There...

1225
01:10:24,698 --> 01:10:29,139
It was easy, wasn't it?

1226
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:33,926
You and me we're
the same breed, wildfire.

1227
01:10:33,968 --> 01:10:38,627
When we something we want,
we go after it.

1228
01:10:38,669 --> 01:10:41,760
Relax.

1229
01:10:41,802 --> 01:10:44,546
All your troubles are over.

1230
01:10:44,588 --> 01:10:47,026
That cloth

1231
01:10:47,068 --> 01:10:49,507
smelled like Mabel
Maycroft's lousy perfume.

1232
01:10:49,549 --> 01:10:51,377
It was just as burning.

1233
01:11:06,044 --> 01:11:08,961
What happened next
I only learned later.

1234
01:11:09,003 --> 01:11:12,530
At the time I was strictly
or as they come back,

1235
01:11:12,572 --> 01:11:17,579
which translates roughly
to fractional chloroform.

1236
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:21,060
When I heard that tin pan piano
I knew I was back at Corbin's.

1237
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:23,759
And I knew I was in trouble.

1238
01:11:23,801 --> 01:11:27,284
I don't know the exact
price that tattle got for me

1239
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:31,854
but I can only guess
to be somewhere around $40.

1240
01:11:31,896 --> 01:11:36,641
Back to the dog-eat-dog
circuit and Patch Mcgill

1241
01:11:36,683 --> 01:11:38,513
right where I always dream
that I'd get you some day.

1242
01:11:38,555 --> 01:11:40,689
Right here in Patch Mcgill's fist.

1243
01:11:40,731 --> 01:11:43,431
How does it feel, you mongrel?

1244
01:11:43,473 --> 01:11:44,873
Fortunately I
couldn't feel a thing.

1245
01:11:48,042 --> 01:11:50,307
Ransom!

1246
01:11:50,349 --> 01:11:52,222
Mr. Mcgill, prefers
it to be called an award,

1247
01:11:52,264 --> 01:11:54,311
for finding your dog.

1248
01:11:54,353 --> 01:11:56,705
Oh, I have no hand in it.
I'm just a messenger.

1249
01:11:56,747 --> 01:11:57,880
He told me to tell you,
you could take it or leave it.

1250
01:11:57,922 --> 01:12:00,709
But $2000?!

1251
01:12:00,751 --> 01:12:04,147
There won't be $2000,
there won't be as much as $2!

1252
01:12:04,189 --> 01:12:06,062
I'll see Patch Mcgill...
Very good gentlemen, very good.

1253
01:12:06,104 --> 01:12:08,412
The animal means nothing to me.

1254
01:12:08,454 --> 01:12:10,458
But I shouldn't say that.

1255
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,850
Because he does
mean something to me.

1256
01:12:11,892 --> 01:12:14,200
He's a grand piece of dog flesh.

1257
01:12:14,242 --> 01:12:16,725
And he's entitled
to a decent home.

1258
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:19,728
And I think you're going
to have to give it to him.

1259
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:20,990
But apparently
not... wait a minute.

1260
01:12:21,032 --> 01:12:24,515
Just a minute there.

1261
01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:26,822
- $2000...
- Cash, Mcgill says.

1262
01:12:26,864 --> 01:12:28,693
Don't give him the money, Mr.
Wyndham.

1263
01:12:28,735 --> 01:12:31,609
I love that animal but this,
this is criminal.

1264
01:12:31,651 --> 01:12:34,133
I want that dog
back and they know it.

1265
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:35,831
I'll be there tonight.

1266
01:12:35,873 --> 01:12:38,355
Well if you don't like...
Never mind the directions,

1267
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:40,401
I could find that
place with my eyes shut.

1268
01:12:40,443 --> 01:12:42,228
You can hear the screaming
of the dying dogs a mile away.

1269
01:12:42,270 --> 01:12:44,492
Oh, they were not dogs,

1270
01:12:44,534 --> 01:12:46,276
they were customers who
had their credit cut off!

1271
01:12:46,318 --> 01:12:47,886
Well, thank you gentlemen,

1272
01:12:47,928 --> 01:12:49,975
you've taken a great
weight of my mind.

1273
01:12:50,017 --> 01:12:53,196
And I am much obliged too.
I can't say more than that.

1274
01:12:53,238 --> 01:12:54,918
Good day to you gentlemen,
good day to you.

1275
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:21,572
Excuse me,

1276
01:13:21,614 --> 01:13:25,576
I'm looking for someone
with the name of Patch Mcgill.

1277
01:13:25,618 --> 01:13:27,273
I happen to be that gentleman.

1278
01:13:27,315 --> 01:13:29,406
May I inquire who is calling?

1279
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:31,669
Wyndham is my name.

1280
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:33,062
Well, Mr.
Wyndham, what's your pleasure?

1281
01:13:33,104 --> 01:13:35,151
Glass of beer,

1282
01:13:35,193 --> 01:13:37,675
introduction to one
of our sweet young ladies or

1283
01:13:37,717 --> 01:13:40,983
is this a business call?
- Business.

1284
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:44,247
Ah the most charming
word in the English language.

1285
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:46,423
Shall we retire to
the conference room?

1286
01:13:46,465 --> 01:13:47,771
Yes, yes, by all means.

1287
01:13:55,822 --> 01:14:00,481
I hope you brought
it in small bills.

1288
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:02,481
No, I brought it in person.

1289
01:14:09,053 --> 01:14:11,334
This is a personal quarrel,
gentleman, an affair of honor.

1290
01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:36,297
Good for you, sir.

1291
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:33,965
We'll see you in
a little while, Galahad.

1292
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:36,359
We got many things
to do before the show.

1293
01:15:36,401 --> 01:15:38,056
You relax.

1294
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:42,887
Let judges do the worrying.

1295
01:15:42,929 --> 01:15:45,324
I don't have to tell you
how important this is, do I?

1296
01:15:45,366 --> 01:15:47,283
Win this show and
you're the champion.

1297
01:15:47,325 --> 01:15:50,068
Yes.

1298
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:51,896
Now you just forget all
about the ribbons, old boy.

1299
01:15:51,938 --> 01:15:53,855
Have your self some fun.

1300
01:15:53,897 --> 01:15:55,639
It'll mean more when you're ready.

1301
01:15:55,681 --> 01:15:56,901
You know maybe when
the shows over with,

1302
01:15:56,943 --> 01:16:00,165
I will find you a girlfriend.

1303
01:16:00,207 --> 01:16:02,516
What a guy!

1304
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,996
It was a tough choice.

1305
01:16:05,038 --> 01:16:07,129
All these people whom I owed

1306
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:10,088
so much wanted me
to win the gold cup.

1307
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,308
And I wanted to do one thing
that will lose it for me.

1308
01:16:12,350 --> 01:16:15,659
Kill my father.

1309
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:18,314
A choice got tough
every time I looked across

1310
01:16:18,356 --> 01:16:22,274
into miss ladyship's eyes
and so that I was thrown away.

1311
01:16:22,316 --> 01:16:25,974
The more I looked at her
the less I hated my old man.

1312
01:16:26,016 --> 01:16:28,759
After all if it hadn't been for him
I wouldn't be here, would I?

1313
01:16:28,801 --> 01:16:31,762
I mean I wouldn't be
fighting for the championship.

1314
01:16:31,804 --> 01:16:33,938
Making a lot of
nice people happy in

1315
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:39,248
trying to win the
paw of a fair lady.

1316
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:42,991
I bet he's a pretty
good gaffer at that.

1317
01:16:43,033 --> 01:16:46,516
It may be enough to
take away his cup from him.

1318
01:16:46,558 --> 01:16:48,866
Why not be noble
about the whole thing?

1319
01:16:48,908 --> 01:16:51,476
Noble and smart.

1320
01:16:59,179 --> 01:17:03,751
Well, he was at last, my old man.

1321
01:17:03,793 --> 01:17:06,057
Pretty good old gaffer.

1322
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:08,407
On not him, what a character.

1323
01:17:08,449 --> 01:17:11,193
Arrogant? Cocky?

1324
01:17:11,235 --> 01:17:14,152
A real wise guy.

1325
01:17:14,194 --> 01:17:15,805
So he's a champion, well so what?

1326
01:17:30,384 --> 01:17:32,170
Well, that did it.

1327
01:17:32,212 --> 01:17:34,695
Was no woman safe around this guy?

1328
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:36,435
Let Nolan and Wyndham
win their own cups.

1329
01:17:36,477 --> 01:17:38,176
I had unfinished business.

1330
01:17:54,408 --> 01:17:56,281
Keep that mutt away
from regent royal.

1331
01:17:56,323 --> 01:17:59,023
This dog is too expensive...
Oh is that so?

1332
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:00,285
Well if you want
to keep him valuable

1333
01:18:00,327 --> 01:18:02,244
take him out of the show.

1334
01:18:02,286 --> 01:18:03,114
Because after the show,
he won't be worth anything.

1335
01:18:03,156 --> 01:18:05,900
Nothing!

1336
01:18:05,942 --> 01:18:07,423
He took the words
right out of my mouth.

1337
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:17,781
Ladies and gentlemen.

1338
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:19,957
If you will allow the judges

1339
01:18:19,999 --> 01:18:23,047
to tally up their scorecards,

1340
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:26,224
we will announce the winner
in the bull terrier class

1341
01:18:26,266 --> 01:18:29,793
for the championship of America.

1342
01:18:29,835 --> 01:18:33,231
All these nice people had come
to the garden to see a show.

1343
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:35,756
Well they were sure gonna see one.

1344
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:38,367
They were about to
see which dog was the best.

1345
01:18:38,409 --> 01:18:42,632
Bowery style win, lose or draw.

1346
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:45,548
I was going after my old man.

1347
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,770
The final decision,
in the bull terrier competition.

1348
01:18:49,812 --> 01:18:54,426
The winner and new champion,

1349
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:55,906
prince Galahad of Wyndham.

1350
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:02,217
- Nolan, congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

1351
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:04,698
- George.
- Mr. Wyndham

1352
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,439
congratulations, Nolan.
It's wonderful, isn't it?

1353
01:19:07,481 --> 01:19:11,313
This was the moment of truth,
the time for the kill.

1354
01:19:11,355 --> 01:19:13,489
Everything inside
me said go get him.

1355
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:15,709
But suddenly I just couldn't move.

1356
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:17,406
Maybe it was the way
he took it on the chin.

1357
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:20,322
A champion even in defeat

1358
01:19:20,364 --> 01:19:22,672
and I understood then
why my mother had loved him.

1359
01:19:22,714 --> 01:19:25,066
I taken away his championship

1360
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,763
and he would never
know I was his son.

1361
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:28,373
That seemed punishment enough.

1362
01:19:28,415 --> 01:19:30,462
A funny thing.

1363
01:19:30,504 --> 01:19:32,726
I came wanting to
teach my old man a lesson

1364
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,510
instead I had learned
a lesson myself.

1365
01:19:40,514 --> 01:19:42,910
Where did those guys get
off making fun of the champion.

1366
01:19:42,952 --> 01:19:45,347
We all have to lose some day.

1367
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:48,219
They would murder him.

1368
01:19:48,261 --> 01:19:50,439
My old man sure
needed a friend now.

1369
01:19:50,481 --> 01:19:51,919
And I was his boy.

1370
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,381
Holy Toledo!

1371
01:21:03,423 --> 01:21:05,514
Me and my old man,
we sure started something.

1372
01:21:13,390 --> 01:21:15,872
I had crossed the Rubicon,

1373
01:21:15,914 --> 01:21:17,743
there was no turning back.

1374
01:21:17,785 --> 01:21:19,397
I had to enter my
invitation to all the things

1375
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:21,399
most men and most dogs want.

1376
01:21:21,441 --> 01:21:24,098
Security, social prominence

1377
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,708
and the love of a beautiful girl,

1378
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,491
with dull...

1379
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:34,456
Easiest catch I ever made.

1380
01:21:34,498 --> 01:21:36,588
Came in low and fast.

1381
01:21:36,630 --> 01:21:38,286
Yes, sir.

1382
01:21:38,328 --> 01:21:41,115
Homerun of a very first twist.

1383
01:21:41,157 --> 01:21:44,814
Well, now settle down,
take it easy.

1384
01:21:44,856 --> 01:21:46,511
You've got no worries at all

1385
01:21:46,553 --> 01:21:50,689
from here on, none whatsoever.

1386
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:53,779
Now, stand back in there
you fellow stand back.

1387
01:21:53,821 --> 01:21:55,651
You've got a new visitor.

1388
01:21:55,693 --> 01:21:58,219
Yeah, a regular marathon runner.

1389
01:21:58,261 --> 01:21:59,568
As soon as he catches
his breath he'll

1390
01:21:59,610 --> 01:22:04,660
probably tell you all about it.

1391
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:06,270
Wrist full of male.

1392
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:08,272
In less than two minutes

1393
01:22:08,314 --> 01:22:11,101
I'd gone from the
top of New York society,

1394
01:22:11,143 --> 01:22:15,018
the pinnacle dogdom
all the way to the bottom

1395
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:19,805
as Jimmy jocks would say
'sic transit Gloria Mundi'.

1396
01:22:19,847 --> 01:22:23,157
All the paths of glory
lead but to the dog catcher.

1397
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:24,593
The only part that hurt

1398
01:22:24,635 --> 01:22:27,074
was a thought of passing
my last moments.

1399
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:29,337
With a scurvy as bunch of mongrels

1400
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:31,078
as had ever been picked
up on the streets in New York.

1401
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,993
They looked like something

1402
01:22:33,035 --> 01:22:35,038
that had escaped from
madame tussaud's waxworks

1403
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:38,607
on a very hot day.

1404
01:22:38,649 --> 01:22:42,524
I'm certainly glad my
mother couldn't see me now.

1405
01:22:42,566 --> 01:22:48,704
Mother, at long last I found her.

1406
01:22:48,746 --> 01:22:52,186
I was so happy I almost
forgot we were behind bars

1407
01:22:52,228 --> 01:22:56,146
and heading for that long
slow walk to the gas chamber.

1408
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:57,828
If only the mounties
would arrive in time.

1409
01:23:00,932 --> 01:23:03,545
Listen, did you happen
to see a white bull terrier,

1410
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:06,287
he was about so long
and about this tall?

1411
01:23:06,329 --> 01:23:09,246
Seen him? Well he's coming
running down through here

1412
01:23:09,288 --> 01:23:10,508
as if he's trying to make to

1413
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:11,553
post office before they closed it

1414
01:23:11,595 --> 01:23:13,816
but I timed it perfectly.

1415
01:23:13,858 --> 01:23:18,473
I drew, back and I
bagged him on the wing...

1416
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:20,040
You got him in here?

1417
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:21,998
Locked tight.

1418
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,696
But, but, he is the champion
bull terrier of America.

1419
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:28,396
No kidding! My first champion.

1420
01:23:28,438 --> 01:23:30,311
Will you unlock...
The gates here, let me have him.

1421
01:23:30,353 --> 01:23:31,573
No, I'm sorry I can't do that.

1422
01:23:31,615 --> 01:23:33,227
It's the city orders

1423
01:23:33,269 --> 01:23:34,358
against dogs running loose
on the streets.

1424
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:38,536
Oh, yes, yes. How much?

1425
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:40,060
Are you trying to
corrupt a civil servant?

1426
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:41,452
Certainly.

1427
01:23:41,494 --> 01:23:44,716
Good! I've got 10 dogs in there.

1428
01:23:44,758 --> 01:23:45,630
Make you a deal for
the whole lot of them.

1429
01:23:45,672 --> 01:23:48,720
Two bucks a piece.

1430
01:23:48,762 --> 01:23:52,942
Here's 50.

1431
01:23:52,984 --> 01:23:53,682
What you going do
with the other nine?

1432
01:23:53,724 --> 01:23:55,684
Why?

1433
01:23:55,726 --> 01:23:57,729
For another buck a piece
I'll taken them off your hands.

1434
01:24:07,259 --> 01:24:09,002
Mister,
they are yours for nothing.

1435
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:11,917
Well, off to the hunt.

1436
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:16,922
Tally ho!

1437
01:24:16,964 --> 01:24:20,361
Come on, our pilot's gone.
Come on, boy.

1438
01:24:20,403 --> 01:24:22,493
No, don't worry about
what happened back there.

1439
01:24:22,535 --> 01:24:24,930
That was one of the
greatest sights I ever saw.

1440
01:24:24,972 --> 01:24:27,194
Oh, I see you picked
yourself up a friend.

1441
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:28,934
Well, bring her along if
you like that little old lady.

1442
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:30,414
That, that's good enough for me.

1443
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:31,896
Come on, come on, boy.
Come on, girl.

1444
01:24:36,897 --> 01:24:40,250
Oh, miss ladyship.

1445
01:24:40,292 --> 01:24:46,474
What a lovely girl.
Am I glad to see you.

1446
01:24:46,516 --> 01:24:49,216
You know, I think we
may have the makings of a

1447
01:24:49,258 --> 01:24:52,871
nice little family here.

1448
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:54,873
Miss ladyship,
I, you know I think,

1449
01:24:54,915 --> 01:24:57,398
you not only found
yourself a husband but...

1450
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,443
Wildfire, you,
you know, you kinda look like,

1451
01:24:59,485 --> 01:25:02,359
like around the eyes, maybe,

1452
01:25:02,401 --> 01:25:05,014
maybe we got ourselves
a mother-in-law, too

1453
01:25:05,056 --> 01:25:07,321
well, wildfire, girls,
come on let's all of us go home.

1454
01:25:07,363 --> 01:25:08,931
Here we go!

1455
01:25:33,693 --> 01:25:36,045
Congratulations father!

1456
01:25:36,087 --> 01:25:39,440
- There are two boys and...
Three girls.

1457
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:49,926
How about that!
