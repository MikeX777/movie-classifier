Sutthiphong died almost a month ago.

You're still doing less than
half the work he did.

4
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,250
Yes, boss.

5
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,375
Well...

6
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,792
As far as I'm concerned,

7
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,917
no one could finish this job on time.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,750

in less than a month?

00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:57,667
Besides,

10
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,420
it's not part of her job.

11
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:04,420
All right.

12
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,667
If you can finish it before January 2nd,

13
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,830
we'll promote you
as a replacement for Sutthiphong.

14

15
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,625

18

Yeah, whatever.

19
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,875

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,208

Well...

36
00:02:48,583 --> 00:02:51,375
Please don't tell my boss about this.

If you file another complaint,

and she had sex with me in the bathroom.

277
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,292
and pressured him to break up
with my mother.

278
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,625

ever teach you

Our next story

339
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,420
is a horror story about a movie theater.

340
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,000
Are you curious now?

341
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,917
Let's talk to Miss Phraeo.

342
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:15,125
-This is her story. Hello, Phraeo.
-[Phraeo] Hi, Puk.

343
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:16,958
[Puk] All right, Phraeo,

344
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,333
please tell us your story.

345
00:33:19,417 --> 00:33:20,458
[Phraeo] Okay.

346
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,417
First, let me tell you that,

347
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,500
before it became a movie theater,

348
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,708
the building used to be a Hindu temple.

349
00:33:26,792 --> 00:33:30,875
It was later made into a movie theater.
So it seems to have some demonic powers.

350
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,917
It originally had five theaters,

351
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,667
which they cut down to four.

352
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,167
But the fifth one

353
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,333
still shows films all day and night

354
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,208
without an audience.

355
00:33:42,625 --> 00:33:44,830

00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:51,875
[knife slashing]

357
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,875
[Puk] Has anyone ever taken a peek
or snuck into

358
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,875
this fifth theater?

359
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,375
Is there someone

360
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:14,708
or something inside?

361
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,625
[Phraeo chuckles] No one dares.

362
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,750
The staff unanimously decided

363
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:23,417
that we shouldn't go in there,

364
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,830
so it's strictly prohibited,

365
00:34:25,167 --> 00:34:26,333
or else...

366
00:34:31,625 --> 00:34:33,542

[Phraeo] Nun, stop it.

369

Stop kidding around.

370
00:34:46,208 --> 00:34:47,708
You're so lame.

371
00:34:50,458 --> 00:34:52,830
Hey! Hey!

372
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:53,250
Come out.

373
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,830

377
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:28,833
Yes.

378
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:30,792
My friend

379
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,708
asked me to switch shifts with her.

380
00:35:34,792 --> 00:35:36,667

00:48:25,792 --> 00:48:29,250
Please help me. I'm stuck in here.

568
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:30,708
[woman] Miss,

569
00:48:30,792 --> 00:48:32,583
it's okay.

570
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:34,542
He chose you.

[shouting] What do you want from me?

574
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,000
What do you want?

575
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:16,542
Get out!

576
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:22,333
Get out!

[eerie music playing]

584
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,833
Excuse me.

585
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:08,625
Um, this theater is out of service.

586
00:50:08,708 --> 00:50:10,458
My friend is in there.

587
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,833
She hasn't come out yet.

588
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,875
[eerie music playing]

589
00:50:19,667 --> 00:50:22,375
Please wait.
I've already asked someone for help.

590
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:24,292
It won't be long. Please wait.

591
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:26,625
Don't you work here?

592
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,333
Can you go get her?

593
00:50:28,417 --> 00:50:29,583
[woman] Absolutely not!

594
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,667
I mean,

595
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:45,708
please wait until the movie is over

596
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:48,625
to not disturb the other customers.

597
00:50:49,708 --> 00:50:50,667
But that theater--

600
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,542
All right.

601
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,583
We should go in together.

602
00:51:35,417 --> 00:51:36,667
Seriously though,

603
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,958
what's in there?

604
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:49,125
[Ek] This is Oi's shirt.

[girl] Hey!

611
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,830
[Phraeo] Nun, stop it!

612
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,542
Stop kidding around.

613
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:35,583
You're so lame.

Where is she? Oi!

619
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:32,250
A new movie is about to start.

620
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:34,420
We must leave.

621
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:37,625
[Ek muffled]

622
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,833

Come out!

Nun?

Hey! I'm trapped in here!

629
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,000
Help!

630
00:54:00,875 --> 00:54:01,958

Can you hear me?

00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,417
Help me!

634
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:19,420
[woman] Phraeo.
Working a night shift alone?

635
00:54:19,125 --> 00:54:21,000
[Phraeo] Yes. My friend asked me

636
00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:23,000
to switch shifts with her.

637
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:24,667
-[Oi] Hey!
-[Phraeo] She's scared of ghosts.

638
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,000
Nonsense.

639
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,958
There are no ghosts here.

640
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:30,167
Don't go!

641
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,167
Come back!

642
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:34,833
Hey! Don't go! Help!

643
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:36,875
Help me!

644
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:38,250
Hey!

00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,208
[intense music playing]

646
00:54:41,292 --> 00:54:42,792

[screaming]

652
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:17,375
[Phraeo] That's when I learned

653
00:55:17,458 --> 00:55:19,875
that the theater used to be a Hindu temple

654
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:22,625
and that they were showing movies
as an offering.

655
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:26,500
When they turned it into movie theater,
it gained demonic powers.

656
00:55:26,583 --> 00:55:28,000
Many things happened.

657
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,708
They lost money.

658
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,500
But the worst thing was that
people kept disappearing,

659
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:40,750
so the owner turned the fifth theater
into a shrine.

[knife slashes]

667
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,830
[Phraeo] The dolls from the old shrine
were probably gone,

668
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:27,208
so the owner summoned the god

669
00:56:27,292 --> 00:56:29,125
into a new doll.

Come on.

00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:22,583
-Lat Phrao, please.
-Sure, but that's three dollars extra.

674
00:57:23,125 --> 00:57:24,420
Of course it is.

675
00:57:24,125 --> 00:57:26,000
Everyone knows that.

Get in, city girl.

Hi, everyone!

686
00:58:03,208 --> 00:58:04,708
I'm in Bangkok now.

687
00:58:04,792 --> 00:58:06,792
Safe and sound.

688
00:58:06,875 --> 00:58:10,420
If you know of any cool places to hang in,
please let me know.

689
00:58:10,125 --> 00:58:11,625
I really feel like partying.

690
00:58:12,292 --> 00:58:13,292
Oh!

691
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:15,625
If you want to order something,

692
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:17,167
please DM me.

693
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:18,875
If you need it soon,

694
00:58:18,958 --> 00:58:20,375
I'll send it to you first,

695
00:58:20,458 --> 00:58:22,958
but there'll be an extra charge.
If you're not in a rush,

696
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,917
wait until I get back home.

697
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,792
I won't charge you very much. Promise!

WHY DOES SHE LOOK SO GRUMPY?

699
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:32,542
You ask her.

700
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:34,542
It's not my business.

701
00:58:34,958 --> 00:58:35,875
Hey!

702
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:38,125
They're asking what's wrong with you.

703
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:41,667
Someone stole my cell phone.
Now I have to buy a new one.

704
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:43,583
It's hard to make money these days.

705
00:58:44,542 --> 00:58:48,625
STOP BITCHING, HOOKER! IT'S JUST A PHONE.

706
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:54,708
But you're a millionaire!

707
00:58:54,792 --> 00:58:56,458
It's none of your business!

708
00:58:56,542 --> 00:58:58,667
I don't live off my parents like you!

709
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:01,167
You should fix your brain
instead of insulting me!

710
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,458
Use your brain, not your pussy!

711
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:07,333
You're probably using free Wi-Fi
at a café, trying to be a hipster.

712
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,958
Mind your own business!

713
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,420
Try making my kind of money,
then you can judge. Ugh!

714
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:13,625
Unfriend me! I don't care!

715
00:59:13,708 --> 00:59:16,417
Don't judge other people!
You piece of shit!

You psycho!

718
00:59:20,830 --> 00:59:21,958
You condescending shit! Asshole!

719
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,583
Got it?

720
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:31,167
Anyway, to the customers,

721
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:33,420
don't forget to buy!

722
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:34,583
And make sure you pay.

723
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,583
Or I'll block you all!

724
00:59:37,917 --> 00:59:38,917
-Bee.
-Hmm?

725
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,917
Could you cut? I'm upset.

726
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,375
But it's my live video.

727
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,542
You don't have to say anything.

728
00:59:44,625 --> 00:59:48,167
I'll just chat with my followers, okay?

729
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:49,542
Anyway, so--

730
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:50,458
[beeps]

You bitch!

736
01:00:36,667 --> 01:00:38,000
Where's my deposit?

737
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,420
I used it to buy lottery tickets.

738
01:00:44,830 --> 01:00:47,500
I got some lucky numbers from the mediums,

739
01:00:47,583 --> 01:00:49,792
and then I dreamed about the numbers,

740
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:52,625
but I haven't won anything yet.

741
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,833
I'll pay you back if I win. Okay?

742
01:00:58,208 --> 01:00:59,458
Bitch!

743
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:01,500
It better be soon!

744
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:30,667
You said you told them to clean it.

745
01:01:31,625 --> 01:01:34,830
I did, but I guess they didn't do it.

746
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:35,458
It's not my fault.

747
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:39,375
Help me find the TV remote.

748
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:44,625
Shorty!

749
01:01:44,833 --> 01:01:46,208
Before watching TV,

750
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:48,830
shouldn't we clean the place first?

751
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,667
[huffs]

752
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:53,458

What a lame picture.

756
01:02:28,542 --> 01:02:30,830
Look at those kids.

757
01:02:30,833 --> 01:02:32,250
They don't even look alike.

758
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,958
They probably had different fathers.

759
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:38,250
Or maybe the old hag is his second wife.

760
01:02:38,333 --> 01:02:39,958
You have such a foul mouth.

761
01:02:41,792 --> 01:02:43,125
Let's take a selfie.

This is creepy.

01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:20,167
That's good.

773
01:03:21,375 --> 01:03:24,833
We can use this haunted thing
as an excuse to leave here early,

774
01:03:24,917 --> 01:03:26,750
so we don't have to pay the rent.

775
01:03:27,792 --> 01:03:29,167
Perfect.

776
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:31,292
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

777
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:38,250
But if you're scared,
you can get rid of the picture.

01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,375
No!

779
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,333
They'll charge us.

780
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:43,833
I don't want to waste money.

781
01:03:45,917 --> 01:03:47,420

That's not gonna make you taller, shorty.

805
01:05:47,625 --> 01:05:49,375
I'm going to buy a new cell phone.

806

01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,292
I have to have it.

817
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:58,208
It'll make me look classy.

818
