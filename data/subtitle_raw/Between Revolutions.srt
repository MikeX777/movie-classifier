1
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:36,458
The river and the moon
are splitting me in two

2
00:03:37,167 --> 00:03:39,875
And the night is like blood
flowing from my mouth.

3
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,792
We used to be one, we used to be one

4
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:48,042
I never knew cliffs could be so wild.

5
00:03:50,708 --> 00:03:54,250
Falling like in a dream of sickles,
There is the moon

6
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:58,583
And the river splitting me in two,
I say it again

7
00:04:00,042 --> 00:04:01,708
We used to be one,

8
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,542
We used to be one.

9
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:15,000
Dear Zahra,

10
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,708
How are you?

11
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,958
Did you arrive well?

12
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:28,250
It's hard to realise we won't be
classmates in the final year.

13
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,833
Bucharest will be
different without you here.

14
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:44,667
After you left, I stayed there,
on the bright sidewalk.

15
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:50,625
When I turned to leave,
my skin was too tight

16
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:54,958
and the tree next to me
had withered in the scorching sun.

17
00:04:58,292 --> 00:05:00,542
Its shadow had grown thin.

18
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:09,208
I stayed there long enough
to see you fly above me.

19
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:15,958
I know which way the plane went.

20
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,208
It went East.

21
00:05:23,417 --> 00:05:25,292
When will you be back?

22
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,083
Dear Maria,

23
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,042
I arrived safely home, in Tehran.

24
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,292
The first thing I felt was emptiness.

25
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:27,417
The emptiness of not being with you.

26
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:33,250
I wish you were here,
so I could show you my favourite places.

27
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:43,250
I wish I could tell you
I will return soon, but I don't know yet.

28
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,000
Something important is happening here.

29
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,167
Something I want to be part of.

30
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,500
People are not afraid anymore.

31
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:03,292
They feel the time has come for change.

32
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:08,417
I work side by side
with my father, writing manifestos.

33
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:14,333
I write down his ideas
and we hand them out to people.

34
00:07:18,167 --> 00:07:21,625
Each day we try to use fewer words,

35
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,375
to write clearer messages.

36
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,500
United, we will defeat the Shah.

37
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:35,833
United, we will defeat imperialism.

38
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,333
My dear,

39
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,458
Now most of my memories include you.

40
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:33,083
I have brought you into all of them,

41
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:34,792
even my old ones.

42
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:43,667
I feel like the voice in my head
has always spoken with you.

43
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:52,500
I went to the seaside
for a few days, with my sister Anca.

44
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,125
I sat on the beach,
I looked into the distance

45
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,458
and I imagined you.

46
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,417
Over a sea and some mountains.

47
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:07,625
In the streets of Tehran.

48
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,292
Among people.

49
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:15,833
Happy and confident
of the changes in your country.

50
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,792
But please be careful,

51
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,375
don't put yourself in danger.

52
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:31,250
I would like you to come back,
after all of this.

53
00:09:31,417 --> 00:09:34,500
And to go to the seaside with you.

54
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:39,042
To jump into the water.

55
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:44,750
This time I won't be afraid to jump.
I will hold your hand.

56
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:42,250
Between Revolutions

57
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:49,292
Down with the Shah!

58
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:18,708
Glory to Islam!

59
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:23,500
Allahu akbar!

60
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,125
Workers, peasants and the oppressed

61
00:11:50,417 --> 00:11:56,250
will be united
to exterminate exploitation.

62
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:01,250
The day Khomeini urges me to holy war,

63
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,542
The whole world's armies
will not stand against me.

64
00:12:56,708 --> 00:13:00,583
[The Shah has fled.]

65
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,833
When the noise is so loud
that you can't hear your own voice,

66
00:13:09,167 --> 00:13:11,542
but you know you do have a voice.

67
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,833
When you are needed there.

68
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,125
When the street has become
a symbol of something else.

69
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,375
When thousands are marching in the street,

70
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,667
and you are one of them,

71
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,542
and it is a force of nature.

72
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:39,667
From some point on, the people
engulf the geography of the city,

73
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:44,125
their feet carve out a new road
to lead them further.

74
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,208
This gives you power.

75
00:13:59,042 --> 00:14:01,458
My father is very confident.

76
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,750
He speaks with people in the streets.

77
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,917
He tells them we need
a fair, solidary society.

78
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,083
He is so happy
we're living this together.

79
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,583
We don't want to start
any ideological debate,

80
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:24,750
despite the many scientific arguments

81
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:29,042
and logical reasons
supporting our beliefs.

82
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:33,083
Our ideology is not a matter
of today or yesterday,

83
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:36,417
nor does it
belong to this society.

84
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,917
It is the outcome
of man's evolutionary process.

85
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,000
My dearest Zahra,

86
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,333
I am happy for your enthusiasm.

87
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:52,333
I know your energy can move mountains,
I've always admired you for it.

88
00:15:54,792 --> 00:15:59,042
Here I only found
a short article in a newspaper.

89
00:16:03,917 --> 00:16:08,417
It said the Shah had fled
and Imam Khomeini had returned to Iran.

90
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:18,583
I don't know who he is, but his photo
looked stern and frowning to me.

91
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:26,708
How is the mood there,
how are you and your family?

92
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:41,708
Meanwhile, I graduated and
was assigned to a village clinic.

93
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:47,375
Far away from my parents in Bucharest,
in an unfriendly place.

94
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:57,958
I asked to be transferred
back to Bucharest.

95
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,167
But they didn't approve my request.

96
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,542
I would like to be
in control of my own destiny.

97
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:19,000
The women we are seeing on screen

98
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,667
are only a few of those
we constantly see around us,

99
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:27,917
of the millions of women
in Romania and around the globe.

100
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:32,542
This year, which is dedicated to them,
they do the same as always:

101
00:17:32,708 --> 00:17:35,000
they give birth, live happily,

102
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,958
work, feel intensely,

103
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,875
think,

104
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,125
suffer, and hope.

105
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:45,583
These are only a few of them.

106
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:55,792
I build brick by brick
up to my ankle,

107
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,542
To my waist,
to my breasts.

108
00:17:59,542 --> 00:18:02,583
My body becomes
twofold inside the wall.

109
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,042
My blood flows into the bricks
through my palms

110
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,250
Then flows back
burning into my temples.

111
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,708
My hair has a heady smell of mortar.

112
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:16,500
My bricks are close together
like blades of grass.

113
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:20,208
I yearn for the supreme intimacy,
when, strangely,

114
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,375
The wall will start burning like me.

115
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:11,042
Last night I thought I saw them again.

116
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,833
Those men in black coats.

117
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,333
The ones who followed us
when we were in university.

118
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:23,542
They were in a car,
near my apartment.

119
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:36,708
As I was walking, I looked
towards the car and our eyes met.

120
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:40,458
I froze suddenly.

121
00:19:48,917 --> 00:19:52,458
I picked up the pace
to get away from their eyes.

122
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,458
I read what you wrote
and I shuddered.

123
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:21,875
I hope you are safe now.

124
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,292
Please, be careful.

125
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,708
Write back as soon as you can.

126
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:39,667
People here are already
talking about an Islamic Republic,

127
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,125
and that scares me.

128
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,000
The ones who came to power
have started the crackdown.

129
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,833
They are after
intellectuals, leftists,

130
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,542
people who wanted
something else, like my father.

131
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:05,042
They are just like
those men in black coats.

132
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,000
Last week, they shut down
my father's organisation.

133
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,417
They consider it illegal.

134
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,875
But we still have hope.

135
00:21:20,958 --> 00:21:23,333
The fight is not yet lost.

136
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,375
Zahra, my dear, I am so sorry.

137
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:24,125
Why are good people always pushed aside?

138
00:22:26,042 --> 00:22:28,292
The ones who give us hope.

139
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:32,750
Those who fight and
sacrifice themselves for others.

140
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:38,125
Remember when you told me
this would be a new beginning?

141
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,000
"The Shah is overthrown!"

142
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,083
"Dictatorship is over!"

143
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:49,792
You dreamed of a fair society.

144
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:55,042
You told me
about Mossadeq, about hope.

145
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:04,208
Isn't this the revolution you dreamed of?

146
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:25,458
Freedom is our culture!

147
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:28,667
Silence is our disgrace!

148
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:33,250
I don't think
the revolution was in vain.

149
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,583
I saw so much hope,

150
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:39,333
so much joy on people's faces.

151
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,833
We all thought it was a new beginning.

152
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:49,000
Better, more dignified.

153
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:55,417
I try not to think of the worst,
to remain optimistic.

154
00:23:56,792 --> 00:23:59,042
Down with the conservatives!

155
00:23:59,458 --> 00:24:03,083
Down with the conservatives!

156
00:24:09,167 --> 00:24:12,583
Down with women not wearing the hijab!

157
00:24:14,792 --> 00:24:18,000
Glory to those wearing the hijab!

158
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,875
I voted for the Islamic Republic,

159
00:24:41,542 --> 00:24:45,542
hoping that I will enjoy

160
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:50,917
the same rights as a Muslim man,

161
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:55,625
so that I can serve my country.

162
00:24:56,333 --> 00:25:00,250
Meanwhile, as I work in the law field,

163
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,958
I hope to be able to pursue my activities.

164
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,833
I haven't voted yet.

165
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:13,292
I'd love to, but I have no idea
about what the Islamic Republic involves.

166
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:23,125
Unlike my wife, I intend to take part
and vote for the Islamic Republic.

167
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:50,750
In my small night there is fear of ruin

168
00:25:52,292 --> 00:25:56,417
Listen, do you hear
the howl of the darkness?

169
00:26:02,083 --> 00:26:05,542
I, like a stranger,
look at this good fortune,

170
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,542
Addicted to my own despair.

171
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:16,042
Listen, do you hear
the howl of darkness?

172
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:00,958
My dear,

173
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:05,375
it's been three years
since graduation, imagine!

174
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:10,667
I felt captive at the clinic.

175
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:14,917
I was finally transferred
back home, to Bucharest.

176
00:28:16,917 --> 00:28:19,250
It wasn't easy getting the transfer.

177
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:29,208
Now I work in a big hospital.

178
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:40,125
But I quickly realised
this place isn't much better.

179
00:28:42,708 --> 00:28:45,708
Everywhere, you have to obey the rules.

180
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:53,083
To do as they say.

181
00:29:04,708 --> 00:29:09,083
I was glad to be near my parents,
but now I feel constrained.

182
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:17,125
My father was told by
the Secret Police about our letters.

183
00:29:22,542 --> 00:29:25,125
He forbade me
to write to you again.

184
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:34,625
He insists that
I get married and start a family.

185
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:11,083
We all come to
that 12 o'clock in our lives,

186
00:30:11,333 --> 00:30:14,542
when the clock hands are one,

187
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:17,917
with the women and the men we love.

188
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:24,458
The loveliest newlyweds
are always the young ones.

189
00:30:25,083 --> 00:30:27,417
Their purpose on earth is,

190
00:30:27,583 --> 00:30:31,875
at the greatest hour
of their biological destiny,

191
00:30:32,083 --> 00:30:37,333
to create new life from their life,
new love from their love.

192
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:05,958
I am afraid of all the eyes around me.

193
00:31:08,042 --> 00:31:10,500
Of all the suspicious gazes.

194
00:31:12,417 --> 00:31:14,833
I'm afraid of the innuendos.

195
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,958
I'm afraid of words.

196
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:27,875
Forgive me for not writing in so long.

197
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:34,208
My father disappeared one month ago.

198
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:40,167
We've searched for him
everywhere, asked everyone.

199
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:57,708
We were told
it's best to stop searching.

200
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:01,208
I can't stop looking for him.

201
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,542
Sometimes I see him in the street.

202
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,292
I run, I touch him,
and he turns around.

203
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,375
But it's not him.

204
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:40,083
My father,
who was my revolution.

205
00:33:42,708 --> 00:33:45,417
The one who taught me hope.

206
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:49,917
The power to imagine the future.

207
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:01,917
Now I can't imagine
anything anymore.

208
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,667
Zahra!

209
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:54,000
I cannot imagine
what you are going through.

210
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:02,583
I'm so angry that
I'm not allowed to visit you.

211
00:35:03,542 --> 00:35:05,667
To be close to you again.

212
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:16,750
I will write to you whenever I can,
no matter what happens.

213
00:35:19,042 --> 00:35:21,000
Even if words disappear,

214
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:24,208
even if someone
erases them by force.

215
00:35:24,583 --> 00:35:26,125
I don't care.

216
00:35:32,833 --> 00:35:36,958
I'll be your shield
and nothing evil will touch you.

217
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:42,417
Let us be one,
let's fight together.

218
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:49,000
Like that time,
when you stayed by my side.

219
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,833
When we had to whisper
so no one could hear us.

220
00:35:58,917 --> 00:36:01,500
Back then, when we were followed.

221
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:07,667
When everything between us
had to stay between us.

222
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:12,167
But it didn't,

223
00:36:12,958 --> 00:36:15,292
because they know everything.

224
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:21,375
Everything we write,

225
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,250
everything we speak,

226
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,083
everything we think.

227
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:41,208
The river and the moon
are splitting me in two.

228
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,583
And the night is like blood
flowing from my mouth.

229
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:48,458
We used to be one, we used to be one.

230
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,458
I never knew cliffs could be so wild.

231
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,083
Back then, my dear.

232
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:01,417
When I was afraid for us.

233
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:05,208
When you told me not to leave.
Not to leave you.

234
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:09,750
But I didn't listen to you.

235
00:39:13,292 --> 00:39:16,375
Even my memories have grown tangled

236
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:18,792
since my father disappeared.

237
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:23,208
Their lines are all blurry.

238
00:39:25,583 --> 00:39:28,000
Time is wearing thin.

239
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:40,417
No one has thought of love,

240
00:40:40,958 --> 00:40:43,583
no one has thought of triumphs,

241
00:40:44,792 --> 00:40:47,500
no one has thought of anything.

242
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:53,292
Five years have passed since
the start of the war with Iraq.

243
00:40:55,167 --> 00:40:58,292
It has turned our lives upside down.

244
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,625
My oldest nephew
has joined the military.

245
00:41:03,083 --> 00:41:04,625
He's only 15.

246
00:41:08,542 --> 00:41:13,208
If he dies, we'll become
the family of a martyr.

247
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:18,667
I am not a mother, so in my family
my voice is not heard.

248
00:41:20,208 --> 00:41:24,708
I cannot talk with anyone
about this child's sacrifice.

249
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:29,708
But I would do anything to stop him.

250
00:41:30,542 --> 00:41:32,417
To stop this war.

251
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:04,792
My sisters are
more dedicated than anyone.

252
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:11,458
Their shoulders bear
the staggering weight of the revolution.

253
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:18,792
After all, they are
the messengers of Hussain.

254
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,125
Messengers of the blood of their children,

255
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:26,250
husbands and brothers who became martyrs.

256
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:33,000
And the grenades they cast forth
with their fragile hands

257
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:38,917
seem to be the same grenades
that their brethren launch

258
00:42:39,417 --> 00:42:42,417
against enemy tanks.

259
00:42:43,833 --> 00:42:47,583
Indeed, the strength in their arms

260
00:42:47,958 --> 00:42:51,792
is due to the healing
blood in their veins.

261
00:42:52,292 --> 00:42:56,083
That is why they are sent to war.

262
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:00,417
They are sent to avenge

263
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:06,250
and to take back what
rightfully belongs to this land.

264
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:11,292
To avenge the injustice

265
00:43:11,458 --> 00:43:16,875
that turned our garden into
barren, ruin-studded ground.

266
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:27,458
My dear,

267
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:31,917
I stand by the window
and look far away.

268
00:45:35,417 --> 00:45:39,708
The sky is dark and low,
like something is about to happen.

269
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:42,792
We are waiting.

270
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:56,000
We try to convince ourselves
the cold is just a state of mind,

271
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:58,667
controllable by willpower.

272
00:46:01,458 --> 00:46:03,792
But it doesn't work anymore.

273
00:46:07,667 --> 00:46:11,125
Romania is not the place
you used to know.

274
00:46:14,083 --> 00:46:16,417
It's gloomier, darker.

275
00:46:21,708 --> 00:46:24,625
A lot has changed in these 10 years.

276
00:46:24,833 --> 00:46:27,542
Just as we have changed.

277
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:37,083
My only joy are the letters from you.

278
00:46:38,917 --> 00:46:42,292
I will reply, although
I've been forbidden to.

279
00:46:59,792 --> 00:47:03,125
I married Marius,
a hospital colleague.

280
00:47:05,167 --> 00:47:08,333
I couldn't keep fighting my parents.

281
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:12,542
I felt cornered.

282
00:47:19,833 --> 00:47:21,667
I had to do it.

283
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,958
I think about you often.

284
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:35,083
Sometimes I wear the earrings
you gave me when you left.

285
00:47:36,917 --> 00:47:41,917
I look in the mirror and imagine
you getting closer to me.

286
00:47:44,917 --> 00:47:47,583
Our reflections become one.

287
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:27,958
In the Name of God.

288
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:33,542
Of God we are
and to Him we return.

289
00:48:34,958 --> 00:48:38,083
The exalted soul of the leader

290
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:41,292
of muslims and freedom-loving people,

291
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:46,083
Imam Khomeini
has ascended to Heaven.

292
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:21,500
My house was broken into.

293
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,333
My things were scattered everywhere.

294
00:49:25,667 --> 00:49:27,042
Turned upside down.

295
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:31,792
My beloved books, my family albums,

296
00:49:32,333 --> 00:49:33,708
my diary,

297
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,917
the letters from you.

298
00:49:36,708 --> 00:49:39,042
I knew they were not burglars.

299
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:44,625
Because I am continuing my father's work.

300
00:49:44,833 --> 00:49:48,792
Because I still believe
in what he believed.

301
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:53,292
I saw my whole life
pulled out of drawers.

302
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:01,750
I breathed a sigh of relief
that I was not home when it happened

303
00:50:02,167 --> 00:50:04,500
and that I'm still alive.

304
00:50:08,958 --> 00:50:13,958
I try not to question all that happened
since my return from Romania.

305
00:50:14,542 --> 00:50:19,500
This is of utmost importance,
not questioning anything.

306
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:25,083
Believing in myself.

307
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:29,583
As I was a few years ago.

308
00:52:22,833 --> 00:52:25,167
Down with CeauČescu!

309
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:36,958
[Friendship]

310
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:29,083
The army stands with us!

311
00:53:49,917 --> 00:53:52,458
When thousands are marching in the street

312
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:54,417
and you are one of them,

313
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,625
and this is a force of nature.

314
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:06,208
I remembered your stories about Iran.

315
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:11,000
That energy in the streets.

316
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:17,083
The hope that your voice is heard.

317
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,500
Among the thousands of others.

318
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:45,458
At the hospital,
there were many wounded.

319
00:54:47,958 --> 00:54:50,833
I felt I was truly on the front line.

320
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:59,250
Marius wasn't with me,
he stayed home.

321
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:02,958
I felt alone.

322
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:40,917
Things are happening so fast,

323
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:45,708
I don't have time
to think about them.

324
00:55:47,708 --> 00:55:49,958
We are supposedly free now.

325
00:55:51,208 --> 00:55:55,083
But I know from you
that victories can be confiscated.

326
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:22,125
Dear Zahra,

327
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:24,917
I hope you are well.

328
00:57:25,167 --> 00:57:28,000
I kept waiting for your letters.

329
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:36,000
I have a feeling
something bad has happened to you.

330
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:39,500
But I hope I am wrong.

331
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,083
We were so happy
about the fall of the regime.

332
00:57:46,833 --> 00:57:48,458
We felt free.

333
00:57:52,958 --> 00:57:54,708
But it's been a year,

334
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:57,875
and our money is becoming worthless.

335
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,667
We can't afford anything anymore.

336
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:04,833
We've lost our bearings.

337
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:08,292
We fear for our jobs.

338
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,667
My parents are in constant panic.

339
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:27,458
They've just retired.

340
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,500
They barely manage.

341
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:40,292
At least Marius is doing something.

342
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:43,667
He left the hospital and
opened a small business.

343
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:52,125
He sells tobacco and sweets
that be brings from Turkey.

344
00:59:08,042 --> 00:59:11,083
I've been thinking about us lately.

345
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:15,417
I quite hesitated to ask you...

346
00:59:18,458 --> 00:59:22,125
All this time I thought
you left for your revolution.

347
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:25,417
But maybe there were other reasons.

348
00:59:26,542 --> 00:59:29,208
Maybe you chose the safer path.

349
00:59:29,917 --> 00:59:33,917
Maybe you thought
you'd protect me by leaving.

350
00:59:35,333 --> 00:59:38,500
I wish we could stand face to face.

351
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:43,083
Look at each other,
talk to each other.

352
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:46,417
Tell each other all these things.

353
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:52,000
I wish we could start all over again.

354
01:01:46,667 --> 01:01:49,042
I can't remember your voice.

355
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:55,417
I look at our photos.

356
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:59,125
We were always so close to each other

357
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:04,292
that I found it easy
to cut out our silhouettes.

358
01:02:11,458 --> 01:02:15,542
I want to zoom into them,
because they are fading.

359
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:28,292
When do people start
to fade away from paper?

360
01:02:29,917 --> 01:02:31,958
We are fading together.

361
01:02:37,542 --> 01:02:39,833
When I imagine you talking to me,

362
01:02:39,958 --> 01:02:43,250
I'm not even sure
it's your voice I'm hearing.

363
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:48,500
Sometimes I think it's my own,

364
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:51,500
just myself in my head,

365
01:02:53,542 --> 01:02:55,792
and that frightens me.

366
01:03:02,417 --> 01:03:04,333
Where are you now?

367
01:03:10,167 --> 01:03:13,125
Please, at least tell me you are well.
