1
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,166
The one who created this world

2
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,041
with his omnipotent power,

3
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:54,500
who gave life to all creatures
and mankind,

4
00:00:56,666 --> 00:01:01,375
has granted us mortals this world

5
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,875
full of endless colors.

6
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:13,791
Every ruler derives power from him,
and is imprinted in his likeness.

7
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,375
O, God, the one…

8
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,291
You have conferred the form
of every creature.

9
00:01:33,666 --> 00:01:35,958
Defend me.

10
00:01:36,916 --> 00:01:41,916
Give me strength to trample upon Satan.

11
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:51,500
Give me the love of a lover
longing for death.

12
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:59,583
Lighten the burden of the sins
I must bear beyond the grave.

13
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:40,333
Are you hiding? We're not putting the
fuses in yet. Why are you so scared?

14
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,666
I hope you get fucked by a male wolf,
you chicken!

15
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:51,083
- These are full of water.
- That's why I told you not to touch them.

16
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,625
- But I've still got to bring the grease.
- Yes, grease it.

17
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,958
Are you blowing it up yet?

18
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:11,375
I have a plastic bag.

19
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,750
- Don't blow it up without me.
- Why would I do that?

20
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,666
Pull it back.

21
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,125
Pull back and let go slowly.

22
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:35,375
Slowly!

23
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:39,541
One last time! OK! Do it slowly! Good!

24
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:58,416
Finish!

25
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:03,666
Follow her!

26
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,291
Work till the end!

27
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,791
The finish line!

28
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,666
Finish!

29
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,041
Faster!

30
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,125
More! Till the end!

31
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,958
Till the end!

32
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:08,333
Christ was born on the 25th of December

33
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:16,583
- It's hard.
- It's hard, but interesting to learn.

34
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,833
- Should we expect the girls soon?
- Yes, very soon.

35
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,583
It's almost 11:00.

36
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,083
It's almost 11:30 already.

37
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,958
I'm going to complain to the authorities
about this.

38
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:39,541
Be thankful we didn't complain when you
missed several lectures, dear teacher.

39
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,625
- You better be quiet.
- I will still complain.

40
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,541
…and three and four.

41
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,416
C-major. Three and four.

42
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:28,250
We move to F major on "dilav."
Let's start it from the beginning.

43
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:32,083
One, two, three, four.

44
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:37,416
Dilav, dilav, ranina…

45
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:12,333
What's wrong, Malvina?
Keep the same tempo.

46
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:41,500
I want to say a toast
to the memory of one manly man.

47
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:47,666
It's been three years… No, 30 years,
since the passing of Manana's husband.

48
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:52,666
On the 3rd of October,
no 3rd of November.

49
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:56,208
I'm going to stand up in his honor.

50
00:18:56,875 --> 00:19:02,708
He was a real man!
Even in 100 years he will be like that.

51
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,875
Let's remember him, Manana.

52
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:11,666
When my brother said a toast yesterday,

53
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,291
he said a toast for Yuza.
He said that it was his 30th anniversary.

54
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:19,333
We drank to his 30th anniversary.

55
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:23,291
I said that you wanted
to organize an event

56
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:28,375
and he named eight or nine friends
who are still alive.

57
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:35,000
Mr. Zurab, I was Manana's bridesmaid,

58
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:38,708
and my husband was the best man
at the wedding of that great man.

59
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:42,958
30 years have passed, but he is not dead.

60
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:50,041
When family and friends remember you,
you're never dead. Let's drink for Yuza.

61
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,125
Are you still here?

62
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:11,125
You swine. Filthy unbeliever!

63
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,916
Archil, why are you dicking around?

64
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,958
The power went out! The relay broke.

65
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,500
The boys don't have air.
I'll take them outside.

66
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:56,583
- Where are my tools…
- Get to work quickly!

67
00:25:28,708 --> 00:25:30,708
This is good. I don't understand…

68
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,500
The train is sliding!
Put something under the wheels.

69
00:25:49,791 --> 00:25:53,416
Did they turn off the power
from the outside?

70
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
No!

71
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,916
The power is out in our section!

72
00:26:13,416 --> 00:26:17,333
- What's going on?
- I can't feel my fucking legs!

73
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:19,250
The power relay is leaking.

74
00:26:19,333 --> 00:26:21,958
- So?
- There is no air being pumped.

75
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,416
Achiko is trying to fix it now.

76
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,375
I am exhausted.

77
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:32,458
- Want a cigarette?
- I quit.

78
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,666
- Are you going too?
- Yes, I'll give him a hand.

79
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:43,541
I took the guys outside.

80
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,583
- Did you have a big load?
- Just a little bit.

81
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:57,083
You have to find the broken relay.

82
00:29:29,041 --> 00:29:31,750
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning.

83
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,000
Good morning!

84
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,291
Hello!

85
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:18,750
How are you?

86
00:31:55,666 --> 00:31:56,666
Hello.

87
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:01,000
I won't be home tonight.
Rehearsal in the morning.

88
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,458
Leave the light on.

89
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:13,291
I'll have to stay here today again,
tomorrow I will come home.

90
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:19,041
How are the kids?

91
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:21,583
OK.

92
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:38,333
Have you heard?

93
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,250
Mikha is back.

94
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:19,208
People!

95
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:24,500
Women are afraid to leave their house
because of this maniac.

96
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,875
This is unacceptable!

97
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:33,166
You talk too much!
Let's beat him senseless!

98
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:41,333
Oh motherland…

99
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:44,333
The beautiful…

100
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:52,708
There is nothing

101
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:59,875
Like you anywhere

102
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:09,041
Oh motherland…

103
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:15,916
The beautiful…

104
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:22,166
There is nothing

105
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:28,416
Like you anywhere

106
00:38:35,708 --> 00:38:38,666
Sit down children. Everyone.

107
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,333
Leave it alone.

108
00:38:40,416 --> 00:38:43,625
I am deeply sorry, children,

109
00:38:43,708 --> 00:38:47,833
that I sometimes run late. Sometimes.

110
00:38:56,916 --> 00:39:00,833
Merab, leave me alone,
I don't have time. I'm in class.

111
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:04,125
I have a class! I will call you after.

112
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:09,083
I know about the wedding.
I will meet with Peter later about that.

113
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:16,166
OK, it's not going to be a problem.

114
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:25,750
OK, thank you. That would be great.

115
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:29,291
I will call you later.

116
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:33,166
Let's start, Bana!

117
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,333
Pass me the instrument.

118
00:39:53,416 --> 00:39:55,416
What's going on here?

119
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,208
Did you get it? What did you get?

120
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:17,208
What did you get?

121
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:20,458
You nod like you got it,
so what did you get?

122
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:23,625
Boys, follow the girl's example…

123
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:28,458
First, second, third, fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh…

124
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:33,458
How can girls be better,
aren't you ashamed?

125
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:37,500
B-flat major, children.

126
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,208
We've been studying for a month and a half

127
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:45,750
and there is no result.

128
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:48,666
It won't work like this.

129
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:52,041
I want you to be praised.

130
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:54,750
When you're praised,
I'll be praised in return.

131
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,666
We can't work like this.

132
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,625
Which school do you go to?

133
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,041
Public school #2.

134
00:41:02,125 --> 00:41:03,458
Who is his classmate?

135
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:07,291
- I am. He's in my class.
- Does he study at all in school?

136
00:41:07,375 --> 00:41:08,750
- So-so.
- What?

137
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:09,916
So-so.

138
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:17,458
B-flat major, children.
Who knows "B-flat major"?

139
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:20,375
You will drive me nuts.

140
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,458
B-flat major!

141
00:41:22,541 --> 00:41:23,541
What is it?

142
00:41:24,125 --> 00:41:28,000
Third string in first tonality, first and
second string in second tonality.

143
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:32,291
- B-flat major, Diana.
- Yes.

144
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:33,583
Tell me B-flat major.

145
00:41:33,666 --> 00:41:36,291
First and third strings in first tonality.

146
00:41:36,375 --> 00:41:39,666
Very well.
Kids, do you see now what's going on?

147
00:41:47,791 --> 00:41:50,958
Come inside the building,
since you're here.

148
00:41:51,666 --> 00:41:53,791
Just come inside, for God's sake.

149
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:11,583
Our guests today are Irina Pkhaladze,
Mari Pkhaladze and Ms. Tsitso Bokoveli.

150
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:17,875
Mari is 13 years old and
has already won 13 gold medals in running.

151
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:21,833
I have been training
athletes for 25 years,

152
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:26,708
our city has never had
such a successful athlete.

153
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,458
We are very proud.

154
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,875
I don't push them to their limit.

155
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:42,375
They don't get enough calories,

156
00:43:42,458 --> 00:43:45,500
so I'm afraid to push them.

157
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:49,708
The city feeds them
once a day at the soup kitchen.

158
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:53,291
Eating once a day is not enough.

159
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:57,750
If they could eat three times a day,
I'd push them all the way.

160
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:03,541
This is a huge problem.

161
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,375
If we can find someone
who can sponsor their meals

162
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:12,750
so that the kids
can receive enough calories,

163
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:16,875
we can aim for a world championship.

164
00:47:24,416 --> 00:47:28,000
Hello, how is it going?

165
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:32,708
They stole the metal again.

166
00:47:33,666 --> 00:47:35,250
I have no idea.

167
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:38,041
Common.

168
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:41,916
What do you mean "don't worry"?

169
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:44,958
Should I not worry?

170
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,458
What should I do about the bank loan?

171
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:53,333
No. I came over and everything was gone.

172
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:57,291
I will kill them if I find them.

173
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,541
I'll break those iron rods
over their heads.

174
00:48:06,541 --> 00:48:11,583
I came by to work
and everything was gone.

175
00:48:14,666 --> 00:48:18,666
I was just collecting the metal
for the client

176
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:21,791
to pay down my loan a bit.

177
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,458
I'm going to get evicted.

178
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:30,250
I can't do this anymore.

179
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:32,916
I can't guard it 24 hours a day.

180
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:08,250
- You're blocking me.
- Move.

181
00:52:09,958 --> 00:52:12,708
It's beginning to rain.

182
00:53:46,541 --> 00:53:48,458
One, two, three, four. One, two…

183
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,625
Three… four…

184
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,625
It's OK.

185
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:10,125
Three, four…

186
00:54:20,041 --> 00:54:25,125
I follow you like a mountain mist

187
00:54:26,125 --> 00:54:30,083
I want to make you lost

188
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:37,833
You seemed like a quail with a broken wing

189
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:43,000
But you fled so quickly

190
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:48,625
Where did you get lost

191
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,916
Continue!

192
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,000
Coming up.

193
00:57:40,083 --> 00:57:42,041
Achiko.

194
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:51,666
Guladi.

195
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:55,791
Sit down.

196
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:02,250
Turn it over or you will get dirty.

197
00:59:17,583 --> 00:59:19,541
Koba, this sausage is yours.

198
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:24,250
One of you has to eat it.
Even if you don't feel like it.

199
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:26,458
I ate my share.

200
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:29,833
Are you a company CEO?

201
00:59:30,458 --> 00:59:31,875
Who cares about "shares"?

202
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:34,833
I don't want to eat anymore.
I'm forcing myself to eat.

203
00:59:35,541 --> 00:59:39,250
- Have some more…
- Is it from your "share"?

204
01:00:12,791 --> 01:00:14,750
Kind of smells like chocolate.

205
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:17,583
Is it good?

206
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:34,041
Let me throw it out.

207
01:00:38,041 --> 01:00:39,958
Don't leave the bread uneaten.

208
01:00:44,458 --> 01:00:46,625
- What's your dog's name?
- Mickey.

209
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,958
The tiny one, right?

210
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:50,958
Really tiny one…

211
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:52,625
Yeah.

212
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,833
Finish the food, please.
Let's clean up here.

213
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,791
You are force-feeding me.

214
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,666
- I can't eat it anymore.
- We can leave it here then.

215
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:21,416
Take it to Mickey.

216
01:01:22,291 --> 01:01:24,291
Do we have a bag?

217
01:01:31,208 --> 01:01:32,333
Put it there.

218
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:02,125
I'd like to drink a toast
to all our brothers

219
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:07,625
who died in the mines.

220
01:02:09,208 --> 01:02:13,791
On behalf of our late friend Koba,

221
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:18,875
let's drink to those who put
their uniforms on by themselves,

222
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:21,750
but couldn't take them off again.

223
01:02:21,833 --> 01:02:23,375
May God bless them.

224
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:29,333
There are many others who passed away.

225
01:02:29,416 --> 01:02:35,375
Our brother,
Giorgi died in the mines recently.

226
01:02:35,458 --> 01:02:40,166
To all. It's impossible to count.

227
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,208
May God bless them.

228
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:52,041
The day before yesterday
another young man died.

229
01:02:53,458 --> 01:02:58,125
To the memory of all those
who died working in the mines.

230
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,416
Out of three glasses,
one goes out to them.

231
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,916
Let's never forget them.

232
01:11:39,875 --> 01:11:47,125
Oh motherland, the beautiful

233
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:53,416
Adorned with roses and flowers

234
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,250
You are a gem

235
01:11:57,333 --> 01:12:01,500
You, my sweet homeland

236
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:05,833
My heart beats for you

237
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:10,333
You are my sigh

238
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:14,208
and my joy

239
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:48,500
As your leaf
Shining in the sun rolling in the winds

240
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:56,500
Has flown from you
To the land so far from here

241
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:04,625
So my heart is open
For all the others to share

242
01:15:06,291 --> 01:15:12,500
How I long for you, how I long for you
My Magnolia

243
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:20,416
So my heart goes out to others

244
01:15:22,375 --> 01:15:28,166
I would probably not remember you,
my Magnolia

245
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:43,791
I could not…

246
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:46,083
I couldn't hear you.

247
01:15:57,125 --> 01:16:01,875
OK. I will call you back.

248
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:08,958
- It's really dishonest.
- I did not fall behind.

249
01:16:09,041 --> 01:16:13,541
This is all due to our genes speaking out…

250
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:17,541
Sometimes we want to dance,

251
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:20,083
sometimes we want to sing,

252
01:16:20,166 --> 01:16:24,750
but in the end,
none of this has any meaning.

253
01:16:24,833 --> 01:16:29,291
My dears, none of us here
can dance Swan Lake.

254
01:16:29,375 --> 01:16:31,583
You are wrong! We have done it.

255
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:34,541
We have done it.

256
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:35,666
Show me!

257
01:16:36,958 --> 01:16:39,333
Show me you can dance Swan Lake.

258
01:16:39,416 --> 01:16:40,708
Play the music!

259
01:16:40,791 --> 01:16:43,375
First ask these three…

260
01:16:44,708 --> 01:16:47,250
I don't want them to perform.

261
01:16:48,083 --> 01:16:50,208
I want you to perform Swan Lake.

262
01:16:50,291 --> 01:16:52,958
You will be the first swan.

263
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,333
- Who's the second swan?
- You.

264
01:16:57,166 --> 01:17:03,375
The love of bright sunshine
And wild seas we bear

265
01:17:05,541 --> 01:17:11,750
I don't think southern winds
Will leave and disappear

266
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:19,541
But her heart is open
For all the others to share

267
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:27,458
I don't know why, do you know what for
My Magnolia?

268
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:35,250
So my heart goes out to others

269
01:17:37,333 --> 01:17:43,166
I don't know why, do you know what for
My Magnolia?

270
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:39,375
Have you ever had such a moment
Forever gone?

271
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:47,291
It will come back, it will come back
Don't you think?

272
01:18:49,083 --> 01:18:55,333
The love of beautiful seas
And mountains we bear

273
01:18:56,916 --> 01:19:03,250
I long for you, I long for you
My Magnolia

274
01:20:36,958 --> 01:20:42,208
I wrote the lyrics
and music for this song.

275
01:20:42,875 --> 01:20:48,250
I'll sing it for you for the first time.

276
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:02,375
You are the source of my dreams

277
01:21:03,916 --> 01:21:07,166
I can't take my eyes off of you

278
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:11,958
You are the icon I pray to

279
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:16,666
Your candle illuminates my night

280
01:21:18,541 --> 01:21:22,875
You are the icon I pray to

281
01:21:22,958 --> 01:21:26,250
Your candle illuminates my night

282
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,041
Call me, where are you

283
01:21:32,875 --> 01:21:36,833
Let me look at you

284
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:39,666
For a while at least

285
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Do you need my help?

286
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,875
Open it.

287
01:23:16,041 --> 01:23:17,458
Watch the wagon.

288
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:27,375
Leave it alone.

289
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:32,166
Put it over there, please.

290
01:23:34,833 --> 01:23:36,041
Can you do it alone?

291
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:39,458
I can do anything.

292
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,416
Niko!

293
01:29:10,541 --> 01:29:12,333
To the gray world…

294
01:29:13,875 --> 01:29:15,791
gray century…

295
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:18,750
gray town…

296
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,375
Amen.

297
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:35,500
