1
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,108
Here's to Claudel.

2
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:23,217
Careful, Maurice,

3
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,923
there's bacon in the potatoes.

4
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,985
Not very kosher.

5
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,718
I eat it.

6
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,487
I'm flabbergasted.

7
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,293
It's the first time I've seen

8
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,829
someone of the Jewish persuasion
eating pork.

9
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,196
I eat everything.

10
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,875
I think you're a fine actor.

11
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,807
Why don't you get more work?

12
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:57,352
I'm doing a Claudel play
in Besacon in May...

13
00:00:57,524 --> 00:00:59,355
Why is it good if he eats bacon?

14
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:01,355
Excuse me?

15
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,463
As if you enjoyed seeing someone
of the "Jewish persuasion" eat it.

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,594
- I don't quite understand.
- My wife means...

17
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:11,999
That wasn't called for.

18
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,105
Yes, it was.

19
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:16,905
I'm sick of these putdowns.

20
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:19,401
He keeps harping on it.

21
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,480
I just meant to say I've noticed...

22
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,779
that people of the Jewish persuasion
tend to stick together.

23
00:01:26,953 --> 00:01:28,477
Never seen a mixed couple?

24
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,351
You must admit your people
don't mix very often.

25
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:35,486
That may be behind what's going on...
what's always gone on...

26
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,592
- You know he's staged all Claudel.
- Don't care!

27
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,892
- He's a great director.
- Big deal.

28
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:42,898
He meant no harm.

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:45,801
He thinks I'm a good actor.

30
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:49,232
Flattery goes a long way with you.

31
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:52,109
You think I have enough work as it is?

32
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,604
He may give me a role
in The Satin Slipper!

33
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,051
You're so paranoid!

34
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,586
He grills you about your origins
and I'm paranoid?

35
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,588
He's just curious about other cultures.

36
00:02:05,758 --> 00:02:09,387
He is not! He just finds you weird.

37
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,928
That's not true.
But Goebbels won't call now.

38
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,690
For Claudel, right!

39
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,342
What are you doing?

40
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,145
I love your face when you're angry.
A rabbit in a pit bull skin.

41
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,519
What nonsense!

42
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,353
Nothing matters to you.

43
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,018
That's not true.

44
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,025
You matter.

45
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,585
The Great Role

46
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:49,541
- The movie star!
- Ah, Mr. Silberman...

47
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:50,874
Don't tell Perla you saw me.

48
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,487
You finally do a movie and don't
tell anyone? And it's on tonight!

49
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,950
You're in the paper!

50
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:00,058
It's just a bit part in a TV movie.

51
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:01,659
Don't act so modest.

52
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:04,888
- It's your picture they used.
- Don't tell Perla I was here.

53
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:11,730
Oh, hi, Benny.
It's my agent.

54
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,337
You know everyone...

55
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:17,340
I'm sick of that two-bit dubbing job.
It depresses me.

56
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,968
Say, you know everybody.
Who's this Grishenberg fellow...

57
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:23,948
the one they interview in the paper?

58
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,709
He seems important.

59
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:29,684
You know, the Goldberg boy,
the one who was summa cum laude

60
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:32,620
two years ago...
He saw Grishenberg at the Regina.

61
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:36,057
- Don't tell Perla I was here.
- Know my mother's maiden name?

62
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,595
Grishenberg. He must be family.

63
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,130
No doubt about it.

64
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:43,996
Go see him. Tell him I sent you.
You'll be famous.

65
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,296
I gotta run.

66
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:46,870
And no hello to Perla?

67
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,202
- Don't tell her I was here.
- Why not?

68
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,276
Because...

69
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:57,272
I take pictures of her on the sly.
I don't want her to know.

70
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,384
How he loves his Perla!

71
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:02,316
Pictures of your wife on the sly?
That's weird.

72
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,022
A movie star can be a bit meshugge.

73
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,854
Promise me: Not a word to Perla.

74
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,155
We said, not a word, so not a word.
Never, you hear me?

75
00:07:16,235 --> 00:07:19,568
Never will you marry that tramp!

76
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,401
Elvira's never been my mistress,
you know that.

77
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:27,076
- Shit, your cell phones.
- You and your cell phones!

78
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,644
I'll have them confiscated at the door!
And you there, pipe down!

79
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,808
Will you turn that damn thing off?

80
00:07:33,653 --> 00:07:36,417
That's not my ring.

81
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,385
- And I don't have one.
- Mine's on vibrate.

82
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:40,890
Really?

83
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,463
- Sorry, it's mine.
- Can you shut it off?

84
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:51,492
Just a sec, it's my wife.

85
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,575
While I'm at it...
You're not bothering me at all.

86
00:07:59,745 --> 00:08:02,339
I'll call you back when I finish.

87
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,909
You sent me a message?
I'll read it right away.

88
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,551
Gotta go. I love you.

89
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:15,622
- That's tough to say.
- "Ashkenazi-if-you-ask-me."

90
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,763
15,000! You're kidding?

91
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,592
I can't talk long.
I'll call you back.

92
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:25,501
You know my mare Ocean Queen?

93
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,532
I sold her.
Say "Ashkenazi-if-you-ask-me."

94
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,309
We here to work or what?

95
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,576
I'd like to try new colors.
Maybe some red.

96
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,518
We could knock down that wall,
set up long tables,

97
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,919
to see the tailors.

98
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,556
Try saying "Ashkenazi-if-you-ask-me."

99
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:53,255
- "Ashkenazi-if-you-ask-me."
- What's that supposed to mean?

100
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,558
Why didn't you stop in the other day?

101
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:59,065
You told her?

102
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:00,530
Let's go.

103
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,607
- Why'd you tell her?
- You two and your secrets!

104
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:07,303
One takes pictures on the sly,
while the other...

105
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,139
Who?

106
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:11,078
The other, nothing.

107
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,411
- Let's go.
- What about the other?

108
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:16,521
Anyway, Perla has her own secrets.

109
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:22,355
Like planning a trip to Israel
to see her sister.

110
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,421
- Why say it, Mr. Silberman?
- Why tell him?

111
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:28,624
I can't tell a lie.

112
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,167
You drive me nuts with your secrets!

113
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,271
I'll be in a state all evening now.

114
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,569
I'll be in a state all evening now.

115
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,002
We can't confide in them.

116
00:09:49,388 --> 00:09:50,616
So, when do we leave?

117
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,288
Wednesday. Next week.

118
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,088
How about a kiss?

119
00:09:58,064 --> 00:09:59,622
What's this about photos?

120
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,323
Nothing. Kiss me before I get mad.

121
00:10:03,302 --> 00:10:07,238
We've been together four years.
Stay with me tonight.

122
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,375
- I can't tonight, Carole.
- Then introduce me.

123
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,238
I can't. I need time.

124
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:15,676
- Tell her about me. I'll go see her.
- I can't!

125
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,976
You're 38!
You waiting till your grandma dies?

126
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,119
Watch how you talk!

127
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,551
I'm leaving.
Don't bother calling!

128
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,182
Hi, Carole.

129
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:29,158
She doesn't understand
I can't introduce her.

130
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,787
It would kill Granny.

131
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,958
- Lend me 30 euros?
- You come to the races broke?

132
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,296
- She took the money.
- You're a pain.

133
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,238
I'm off to a birthday party.

134
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,243
- Don't like horses?
- No. So long.

135
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:55,778
- Where've you been?
- Attending ma'ariv.

136
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,014
- What's ma'ariv?
- The evening prayer.

137
00:10:58,324 --> 00:10:59,552
Evening prayer now?

138
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,817
- Getting religious?
- With a beard?

139
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,326
With little corkscrews behind your ears?
That'll be cute.

140
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:08,124
Right, make fun of me.

141
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:12,067
- I saw Grishenberg at temple.
- Grishenberg attends ma'ariv?

142
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:16,870
Unlike you. He'll be there
tomorrow for Shabbat.

143
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,101
What's Shabbat?

144
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:20,943
Just kidding.

145
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,581
Why don't we go to temple tomorrow?

146
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:26,946
- We'll tell him we're actors.
- I'll give him my press book.

147
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:32,185
You make me sick! Going to temple
just to see a star! It's a sin!

148
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,095
I bet on 10 and he falls
before the finish line!

149
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,336
This is crazy!
What in the world...

150
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:49,131
did I do with it?

151
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,008
I'm sure I have one.

152
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,743
I don't remember seeing one
around the house.

153
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,491
From the Goldberg Bar Mitzvah.

154
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,650
- How long ago was that?
- I dunno.

155
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:12,355
About seven years ago.

156
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:32,272
Found it.

157
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,514
I knew I had one.

158
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:37,654
- It looks brand new.
- Does it?

159
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,894
How's this? Do I look like
a regular temple-goer?

160
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,803
- You really going?
- Just for a bit.

161
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,800
Kiss me. You're going to temple.

162
00:12:58,744 --> 00:12:59,870
Kiss me again.

163
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,275
And again, just to see.

164
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,417
- To see what?
- I dunno.

165
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:09,016
This temple stuff does something to me.

166
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,252
Cut it out, they're waiting.

167
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,051
It's a good deed
doing it on Shabbat.

168
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,525
Okay, if it's to do some Mitzvah,
as Sami says.

169
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,094
You say "Mitzvoth"
that's the plural of Mitzvah.

170
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:26,237
I'll say Mitzvoth.

171
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,403
You said to dress.

172
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:31,600
Not in a tux!

173
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,081
It's temple, not Cannes.
Driving on Shabbat!

174
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:40,116
I was late. I wasn't gonna walk
across Paris!

175
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:43,312
I'm on time.
Brought your press book?

176
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,354
I'm not here for the fun of it.

177
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,515
C'mon, we'll miss prayer.

178
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,355
- Not if he's not here.
- Let's get a drink.

179
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,656
- Not staying for prayer?
- What for?

180
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:54,524
You make me sick.

181
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,262
He came by car, too.

182
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,362
So what do we do?

183
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:27,990
We can't leave Sami alone.

184
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,397
He sure has presence!

185
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,101
I like the way he is with his son.

186
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,497
Shut up, dammit!

187
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:37,699
Now you've got me swearing.

188
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,608
Don't pretend to pray, just listen.

189
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,054
- Page 180.
- Shut up, we're praying.

190
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,994
You have no shame.

191
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,226
- Where's Eli?
- I dunno.

192
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,957
- Did Eli leave?
- I dunno.

193
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,795
He wouldn't miss this.

194
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,368
- Hush!
- All right, already.

195
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,505
Silence, gentlemen, we're praying!

196
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,840
Hi, I'm a French actor

197
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,182
See my picture. See?

198
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,418
I play roles like the merchant, the bad guy

199
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,661
J'ai beaucoup...

200
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:36,728
vous le connaissez...

201
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,757
Grichenberg directed a movie...

202
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,263
Come on.

203
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,044
Hai! Yiddish.
Yes

204
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:33,653
Why was he so pleased?

205
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,953
I said Shabbat Shalom in Yiddish.

206
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,255
- You rehearsed!
- The least I could do.

207
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,897
I'm off, Yael's waiting.

208
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:45,131
I'm not sure I got it.
He said something like "Chant of Nice."

209
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,828
- A Winter's Tale.
- Don't be stupid.

210
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,974
The Merchant of Venice!

211
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,042
- The one with Shylock?
- He can do what he wants.

212
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:54,441
- I gotta run.
- We're coming for Shabbat.

213
00:16:54,613 --> 00:16:57,377
That wasn't planned.
Yael won't like it.

214
00:16:57,549 --> 00:16:59,574
The thing is to be together.

215
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,447
So there'll be four of you?

216
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,212
- Can Perla come?
- And Keiko?

217
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,913
Who's Keiko?

218
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,217
How do you pick up all these girls?

219
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,659
There's a current between us.
I can't let them waste away.

220
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,923
How about a loving wife?

221
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,829
30 years with one woman?
Think I'm crazy?

222
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:20,438
Not everyone has a pearl like Perla.

223
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:23,097
He's right.
I only had one wife and she left.

224
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:26,608
- And I'm alone.
- I have my son tonight.

225
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,270
We can't cook! How many are you?

226
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,424
- Any more latkes?
- No, thanks!

227
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:49,761
This is what the Ashkenaz eat?
My wife said you were weird.

228
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,061
I did not!

229
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,439
It's Shabbat and there are kids here!

230
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,906
So Grishenberg's doing
The Merchant of Venice!

231
00:17:59,078 --> 00:17:59,737
What's it about?

232
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,937
What's it about, Maurice?

233
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,344
It's about this merchant in Venice

234
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,974
who borrows from a Jewish
moneylender named Shylock.

235
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:10,883
They make a strange deal.
If the merchant can't repay,

236
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:15,015
Shylock claims a pound of his flesh.

237
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,388
Isn't it anti-Semitic?

238
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,326
- Was Shakespeare anti-Semitic?
- He was Jewish.

239
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,227
He was not!

240
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,595
Sure he was. He was Sephardic.

241
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,795
Anyone with any talent
is a Jew to Sami.

242
00:18:26,972 --> 00:18:27,996
And Sephardic.

243
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:31,802
Doubt me? Shakespeare's real name
was Chaim Perez.

244
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,572
An old Spanish Jewish family
from Toledo.

245
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:39,774
His father emigrated to England
in 1564 during the Inquisition.

246
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,886
- That true?
- You bet!

247
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:45,353
Chaim became William.

248
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,048
Sounds the same!

249
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,091
- Where'd you get that?
- Ignore him.

250
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:50,819
His father was the same way.

251
00:18:50,996 --> 00:18:54,591
He told me Louis de Funes was Jewish,

252
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:57,360
his real name was Eliahu Fenesh

253
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,596
and that he came from Gabes, Tunisia.

254
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:02,831
Don't believe me, see if I care.

255
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,637
Want some more strudel?

256
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,506
Yeah, Sami Perez.

257
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,876
If you insist...

258
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,251
- Let's walk home.
- It's far.

259
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:21,448
Put Maurice on.

260
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,985
Your agent.
At this hour. What a pain!

261
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,291
I heard that!
Tell Perla thanks!

262
00:19:27,466 --> 00:19:32,199
This "pain" busts ass to get you work!
It isn't easy.

263
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,202
No one would've hired you guys if...

264
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,671
- What is it?
- Your cell's always off.

265
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,833
Grishenberg's doing
The Merchant of Venice.

266
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,842
- That so?
- He wants to shoot in Yiddish.

267
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,972
I got you four auditions for Shylock.
But not Edward.

268
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,584
- Why not?
- How should I know?

269
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:50,153
He wants to see everyone but not him.
I may drop him.

270
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:54,918
The audition has to be before Thursday.

271
00:19:55,093 --> 00:19:56,720
We're going away.

272
00:19:56,895 --> 00:20:01,161
Sure, Grishenberg can postpone his film
so Maurice Kurtz can take a vacation.

273
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,131
Plus I'll borrow his car
to take his wife out.

274
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,032
Where can I get the play in Yiddish?

275
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,571
I'm an agent, not a bookseller!

276
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:12,004
It's the key scene.
Give it your all. Don't hold back.

277
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:13,542
Okay?

278
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,909
It's about love here.
And about war there.

279
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:19,710
You're starving.

280
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,820
Let's have it violent, fast and furious!

281
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,289
Freeze!

282
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,187
No one move!

283
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:40,662
Where're the pigeons?

284
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,831
Cut, dammit!

285
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,835
Can't you release pigeons?

286
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,447
You worthless piece of shit!

287
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:53,915
I'll tell my father.
You're dead in this business.

288
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,583
Let's take a break.

289
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:01,454
Really, it was great.

290
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,468
Look what Perla found for me
at the Medem Library?

291
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:17,973
- What?
- Shylock in Yiddish.

292
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:20,236
- The only copy in Paris.
- No kidding!

293
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,040
- And us?
- Every man for himself.

294
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,547
Let's see. That sucks!

295
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,723
Don't you take your calls?

296
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,452
- We were shooting.
- I'd like a bigger role.

297
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,324
Check for my calls. I have urgent news!

298
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,363
Not for you, Edward.

299
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:45,560
Viviane made a cake.
Have some, you look bushed.

300
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,435
We can't shoot.

301
00:21:47,606 --> 00:21:50,234
The pigeons didn't work
and Jerome's furious.

302
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:53,242
That's it for today. Thanks, gentlemen.

303
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,181
Why stick us with guys like that?

304
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,978
He's the son
of the biggest producer in town.

305
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,643
No more nude parts.

306
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,056
The audition's Thursday.

307
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,221
I told you, Perla and I leave
for Israel Wednesday!

308
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:12,795
I did my best. He's ready to lend me
his wife and his car,

309
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,262
but he won't put off the audition.

310
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:20,002
Ajoke, honey.
I don't even know his wife.

311
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,366
Going to see Sarah?

312
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,910
You should come dressed as a Jew.

313
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,703
- As a Jew?
- What's that mean?

314
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:33,180
Find Jewish outfits.
Shylock's a Jew, so dress Jewish.

315
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,946
Why can't I audition?

316
00:22:36,121 --> 00:22:38,988
I need to practice Yiddish
with Granny first.

317
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,522
No more nude parts.

318
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:44,059
- If you could change the date...
- A.M. Or P.M.?

319
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:45,719
You bust my chops!

320
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,826
Let's go.
This is how they thank me.

321
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,764
What'd we say?

322
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,463
They're doing fine.

323
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,972
They manage all right.

324
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,042
There's Simon,

325
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,183
my grandson!

326
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:08,751
I told you, Granny, I'm not in it.

327
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,515
I just dubbed the actor's voice.
That's not me.

328
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,195
Ever since he was a child,
he wanted to be an actor.

329
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:33,675
Nothing else, just an actor.

330
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:37,606
- It's Maurice.
- Hello, Granny.

331
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,946
I xeroxed the play for you and the others

332
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,883
That's really nice of you.

333
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,456
When'll he find himself a wife?

334
00:23:47,626 --> 00:23:50,390
I have someone in mind for him.

335
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:51,824
I'll see you out.

336
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:56,900
She loves children, she's beautiful...

337
00:23:57,068 --> 00:23:58,399
Does this look good on me?

338
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:05,640
I had a blue pinstriped suit.

339
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,279
Have any idea where it is?

340
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:16,846
I can't get my lines down.

341
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,723
Would you read them with me?

342
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:23,119
- You mad?
- I'm sleepy.

343
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:24,962
What's wrong? What is it?

344
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,521
Nothing, I'm just tired.

345
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:35,472
"Is he not fed with the same food?"

346
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:37,941
Memorizing Yiddish isn't easy.

347
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,145
Something's wrong. Talk to me.

348
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,079
It's nothing. I want to sleep.

349
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,824
I'm afraid you'll leave me.

350
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:00,624
Why do you say that?

351
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:04,334
I've never felt you so distant before.

352
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,038
If only my folks could've seen this.

353
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:21,375
Tomorrow I meet the world's
greatest director.

354
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,949
What?

355
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:30,786
Nothing. I'm boring you
with my actor's worries.

356
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,025
Kiss me.

357
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,000
Everything's fine.

358
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:45,372
I love you.

359
00:25:48,413 --> 00:25:50,847
I'm just a bit nervous.
About what?

360
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,344
About you.

361
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,819
Your audition.

362
00:25:58,023 --> 00:25:59,388
That's all.

363
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,817
Good night, my love.

364
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:18,737
"I am a Jew."

365
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,744
What do you think about my voice?

366
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,009
Hoarse, but so what?

367
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:26,878
It's chronic.
Must be psychological.

368
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,247
- What will you do?
- I'm prepared.

369
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,658
That stunt never works.

370
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,037
Hello

371
00:26:57,215 --> 00:27:00,150
We're here for Shylock.

372
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:05,746
Mr. Shylock...

373
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,887
"Shy...," right?

374
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:11,318
Especially with you, miss.

375
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,591
Nothing under S.
When did he check in?

376
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:17,599
It's for the movie.

377
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,329
Mr. Grishenberg...
End of the hall.

378
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:30,172
- Shy with you...
- Come on!

379
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:38,287
So Mr. Grishenberg's not here?

380
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:40,754
- End of the hall.
- Really?

381
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,426
Excuse me...

382
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:52,035
Silence, please.

383
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:57,402
The Venetians here, the Jews, here.

384
00:27:57,575 --> 00:28:01,739
This is an outrage!
Find another way to call us.

385
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,312
I'm sorry

386
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,971
What a schmuck!

387
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,721
Excuse me, I wasn't called.
I'm with friends.

388
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:18,829
Could I see Mr. Grishenberg?
The name's Edward Weisbrot.

389
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:22,896
Simon Laufer.

390
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,698
That's me.

391
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:26,166
Mr. G. Will see you.

392
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,006
They only called up old-timers.

393
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:44,819
- You're not all actors?
- Actors, no.

394
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:49,225
But speak Yiddish, that we can.

395
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:53,694
We're the Marais Yiddish Club.

396
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,764
We saw an ad in the paper

397
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:02,168
about Grishenberg looking
for Yiddish redeners.

398
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,541
What's that mean?

399
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,242
Yiddish speakers.

400
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,444
But acting's a profession.
You need lessons.

401
00:29:12,217 --> 00:29:14,378
Mister, let me tell you,

402
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:19,353
it's not only actors who act.

403
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:23,225
The whole world acts.

404
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:27,960
Even children act
just to make us happy.

405
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:32,095
The acting only stops when you die.

406
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:35,868
Am I not acting at being a survivor?

407
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,441
We're all survivors.

408
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,341
So...

409
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:46,511
why shouldn't we play Shylock?

410
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:51,386
We might even write it better
than Shakespeare.

411
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,549
You have to shoot in Ladino!

412
00:29:55,727 --> 00:30:00,027
The Judeo-Spanish dialect!
Yiddish is meaningless.

413
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,325
You don't understand Shakespeare!

414
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,643
- Maurice Kurtz.
- That's me.

415
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,084
Mr. Grishenberg will see you.

416
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:30,926
He had a good laugh over
your friend Edward's tape.

417
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,492
A good idea.
He had a good laugh.

418
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,471
A lot of parts in theatre?

419
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,945
A lot of parts in cinema

420
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,676
A lot of parts in television

421
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,617
- That right?
- That's right.

422
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,724
Doesn't speak Yiddish but understands

423
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,190
Hello, Mr. Maurice

424
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,025
Hello

425
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:11,768
Mr. Grishenberg wants

426
00:31:11,936 --> 00:31:14,734
to revive the tradition
of Yiddish theater.

427
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,735
- Can I speak English with you?
- Sure.

428
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,116
You like ce quartier in Paris?

429
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,882
What other neighborhood you like?

430
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:34,781
I don't know.

431
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:37,951
I like my neighborhood,
Belleville-Menilmontant.

432
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:45,763
Besides you,

433
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,499
what other actors living or dead,
you think could play Shylock?

434
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:55,201
I don't know.

435
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,439
Maybe Groucho Marx, Woody Allen...

436
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:06,649
Al Pacino or Edward Norton.

437
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:09,684
Very good

438
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,402
Have you ever been to America?

439
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:29,145
I don't speak much Yiddish.

440
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:33,512
But I've heard it spoken a lot.

441
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,087
What do you think of the color
of these curtains?

442
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,596
Can I do the monologue?

443
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,864
Yeah, but tell me first
what you think of the curtains.

444
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:04,538
They match the carpet.

445
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,081
What about the carpet?

446
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,876
Just a minute.

447
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:09,648
Be right with you.

448
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,222
Perla left.
At what time?

449
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:16,224
At 3. And the audition?
What's Grishenberg like?

450
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,420
Did you say we're family?
Where'd she go?

451
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:23,089
Some tall dark-haired guy
around 25 came for her.

452
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:26,327
A handsome Italian
in a fancy convertible.

453
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,664
She left with him?

454
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,034
I'm joking.

455
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,703
Think I'd have told you? You take me
for someone who can't keep a secret?

456
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:40,315
So, the audition. Have nothing to say?

457
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:48,523
- If you hate your cell phone, dump it.
- Now what?

458
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,218
- You're impossible to reach!
- What d'you want?

459
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:54,524
I want to know how it went.

460
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,964
Great. He asked me if I liked
the color of the curtains.

461
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,430
I knew anyhow.
Grishenberg's assistant called.

462
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,040
- And?
- He doesn't want any of you.

463
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,540
Thanks for delivering the message!

464
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,076
Hang on!

465
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:10,981
He doesn't want anyone except you.

466
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,416
He thought you were great.
Let me hug you.

467
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,320
- My neighbors are watching!
- So what?

468
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,485
I've been busting ass for you
for 10 years!

469
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,893
- Just kidding, Benny.
- Me, too.

470
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:33,470
Well?

471
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:36,903
Well...

472
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,241
He wants to see me tomorrow.

473
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:42,473
Great!

474
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:50,185
- We can take our trip later.
- I won't get the part.

475
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,513
Next week we're at Sarah's.

476
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,653
Sure you'll get the part!

477
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:57,656
I came by to pick you up today.

478
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:03,389
I left at 3.
I had to see a new customer.

479
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:06,927
Who was it?

480
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:08,433
A friend of Mr. Silberman's.

481
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,407
Really?

482
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,301
Italian?

483
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,207
No, why?

484
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,676
I have to tell you something.

485
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,747
What?

486
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,916
Never forget, I love you.
I love you so much it hurts.

487
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,028
What's wrong?

488
00:35:46,077 --> 00:35:48,511
Okay, okay...

489
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:54,616
I won't tell you I love you again.
I don't love you.

490
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,220
I promise I don't.

491
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:59,419
I want you to get that role.

492
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:02,724
I'll get it.

493
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:07,663
"Three thousand ducats, well."

494
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,164
"Ay, sir, for three months."

495
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,564
"For three months, well."

496
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:15,663
Relax

497
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,551
"I am debating of my present store,

498
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,186
"And, by the near guess of my memory,

499
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:42,260
"I cannot instantly raise up the gross"

500
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,764
Of full three thousand ducats.

501
00:36:47,305 --> 00:36:48,431
That's good

502
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:49,799
That's better

503
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,775
More relaxed

504
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,069
It's not theatre, it's life

505
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,052
"Go with me to a notary."

506
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,851
Shakespeare did know he was Shakespeare

507
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,157
It was a guy talking to his friend

508
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,659
To me

509
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,595
Shall I read it again?

510
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:26,375
"Go with me to a notary."

511
00:37:28,045 --> 00:37:29,205
Listen

512
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,280
There are 3 guys for this role

513
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,852
I want you to be my Shylock

514
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,524
We are going to see you next week

515
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:49,889
Think, think. Work, work.

516
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,302
Keep it.

517
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,450
This is Jerome Saulnier.

518
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:11,418
We're re-shooting the pigeon scene.

519
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,715
I fired the assistant.
What time is it?

520
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,358
4:20 p.m.

521
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:17,453
Can I call you back?

522
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,554
Make it fast.

523
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,038
Still not dressed at this hour?

524
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,546
Haven't you been out?

525
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,982
I was going out.
You're home early.

526
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,211
You okay?

527
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:46,915
The final audition's tomorrow.
I'm nervous.

528
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:49,993
Go see your friends.

529
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,492
No, they drive me nuts.

530
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:54,295
What're you talking about?

531
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,567
I think they're jealous of me.

532
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,135
Aren't you exaggerating?

533
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,605
They're anxious for you.
Only I am,

534
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:06,902
no one else.

535
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,746
I'm the one who's stressed out,
not them.

536
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,207
I've struggled for years for a big break.

537
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,442
Why don't you grow up?

538
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,452
Last audition.
Think we'd abandon you?

539
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:53,886
We wanted to let you concentrate.

540
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:57,357
You were in such a state.
Go on, you'll be late.

541
00:39:58,929 --> 00:39:59,588
Break a leg!

542
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,460
Break a leg!

543
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:07,531
"I am a Jew!

544
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,497
"Hath not a Jew eyes?

545
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,771
"Hath not a Jew hands,

546
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,738
"organs?

547
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:22,216
"Dimensions, senses,
affections, passions?

548
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,221
"Fed with the same food,

549
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,653
"hurt with the same weapons,

550
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,196
"subject to the same diseases,

551
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,192
"healed by the same means,

552
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:43,938
"warmed and cooled by the same winter
and summer, as a Christian is?

553
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:50,771
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?

554
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,107
"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

555
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,578
"If you poison us,

556
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,885
"do we not die?

557
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:12,058
"And if you wrong us...

558
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,606
"And if you wrong us,

559
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:23,007
"shall we not revenge?

560
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,646
"If a Jew wrong a Christian,

561
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,183
"what is his humility?

562
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,655
"Revenge.

563
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:37,222
"If a Christian wrong a Jew,

564
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:42,422
"what should his sufferance

565
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,334
"be by Christian example?

566
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,261
"Why, revenge.

567
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,665
"The villainy you teach me

568
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,402
"I will execute,

569
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,780
"and it shall go hard

570
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:01,913
"but I will better the instruction."

571
00:42:22,406 --> 00:42:23,634
It's him

572
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,507
My Shylock.
Thank you

573
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:53,602
Well?

574
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,265
Well?

575
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,572
I think I got it.
You think?

576
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,108
You think you got it?

577
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,668
I got it.

578
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,805
Holy shit!
Mazel Tov!

579
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:51,923
Please, stop! Please, leave!

580
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,392
Sorry, they're just kids.

581
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:07,637
You home?

582
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,654
Maurice, I'm going to die.

583
00:44:29,233 --> 00:44:30,564
I'm sick.

584
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:33,594
I'm very sick, Maurice.

585
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,671
What? Sick how?

586
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,206
I didn't want to tell you
because of your audition.

587
00:44:42,713 --> 00:44:44,408
What do you have, Perla?

588
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:53,951
Cancer.

589
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,737
It's Philippe.

590
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,443
Hi, Philippe.

591
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,786
- Did she tell you?
- Just now.

592
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,122
I had no idea.
She hid her appointments.

593
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,987
Is it serious?

594
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:09,989
I just got the results
for the last tests...

595
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,095
And?

596
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:14,497
Is she right there?

597
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:15,763
No

598
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:24,144
I can't tell you like this.
Come see me.

599
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,184
It's Benny.

600
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,187
- I'll call you back.
- Wait a second.

601
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,960
Grishenberg's not giving you the part.

602
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:47,199
What are you talking about?

603
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:52,138
He'll phone you. The star he wanted
suddenly became available.

604
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,138
This is no time to joke.

605
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,146
It's not a joke!

606
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,649
I'll call you back.

607
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,053
Tell me we'll pull through.

608
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:16,062
We'll pull through.

609
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:22,166
And your audition?
Got the part?

610
00:47:24,074 --> 00:47:26,770
I got it.

611
00:47:30,814 --> 00:47:32,008
When do you start?

612
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,281
Soon. The shooting...

613
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,911
There's rehearsal Monday,
costume fittings...

614
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,723
I'll be on the set.

615
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:46,090
Then the shooting starts.

616
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,495
So when do we go see Sarah?

617
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,337
We'll tell her to come.

618
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:21,494
Here, you won 11 euros.

619
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,698
It's a rotten blow.

620
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:27,166
It's not all that bad.

621
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:30,670
There are more important
things in life.

622
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,605
It hit you that bad?
I couldn't care less.

623
00:48:33,777 --> 00:48:35,677
You do care.
Look at your face.

624
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,178
Who wants to see Merchant
in Yiddish?

625
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:41,411
Maybe three rabbis
and some old Polish Jews.

626
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:44,979
We had as much fun
as if you'd got the part.

627
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,457
God gave you joy but not the part.

628
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,519
You've played Shylock
over and over in your head.

629
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:56,128
Perla's sick.

630
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,058
She mustn't get upset either.
It's not your first letdown.

631
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:02,902
She's very sick. It's serious.

632
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,404
What?

633
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:05,768
What're you talking about?

634
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,138
You bullshitting us?

635
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:12,979
What can we do?

636
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,683
How can we help?

637
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,485
I know she's in good hands.

638
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:24,124
You should keep her from getting upset.

639
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,395
Make her laugh.

640
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:31,228
A guy got cured from cancer once
watching Marx Brothers movies.

641
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:35,701
How'd she take your losing the part?

642
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,367
Pretty well...

643
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,973
She took it all right.
She said it didn't matter.

644
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:45,712
Don't leave her alone.

645
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,177
You should stay by her side.

646
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,477
What're you doing with us?

647
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,311
I wasn't going to tell her...

648
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:59,652
You're right. I'll stay with her.

649
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,232
If you need anything, we're here.

650
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:24,711
I can't do it, darling.

651
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:32,748
I won't manage.

652
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:41,989
Sami...

653
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,929
It's Maurice.

654
00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:49,701
Can you tell the others
to be at Benny's in a half-hour?

655
00:51:50,307 --> 00:51:51,467
You said you got it?

656
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,006
You let her think that?

657
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:55,235
She doesn't know?

658
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,879
You've lied for 2 weeks?

659
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,813
You'll make it harder for her.

660
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:04,453
I know. It escaped me that night
and I can't backtrack.

661
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,885
I just can't.

662
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:12,691
- What'll you do now?
- I don't know.

663
00:52:14,097 --> 00:52:17,430
And this lie keeps me
from being home with her.

664
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:21,731
Tell her when you get home.
You can't do this.

665
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:26,103
I say what? "I was bullshitting you.
I'm not making the movie.

666
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,938
"I spend the day walking around."

667
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:30,238
Maurice, listen.

668
00:52:30,413 --> 00:52:32,347
Want me to call her and tell her?

669
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:33,778
No way.

670
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,619
The worst is,

671
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,590
I see how happy it makes her.

672
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:44,893
She seems better
when I tell her about the film.

673
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,863
Who knows?

674
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:51,325
Maybe it can even cure her.

675
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:54,327
Still, it's a sin to lie.

676
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:55,766
Cut the religious stuff!

677
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:56,803
Are you nuts?

678
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,669
God didn't sin by doing this to Perla?

679
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,208
Don't talk like that.

680
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:05,508
Yesterday, there were tons of extras
playing Venetians.

681
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,149
Two or three hundred of them.

682
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,445
A big ship enters the port of Venice,

683
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:12,815
all recreated in studio.

684
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,115
It's magical.

685
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:19,126
The great Rudolph Grishenberg
is now in Paris

686
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,856
to shoot
The Merchant of Venice.

687
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:26,568
Turn that off.
They're talking about you.

688
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:27,600
Where?

689
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:29,170
On the radio.

690
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,434
I wasn't paying attention.

691
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:34,737
I'll turn it up.

692
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,306
Too late.

693
00:53:38,748 --> 00:53:40,147
What a shame.

694
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,959
That must be the nurse.

695
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,394
You lied to me.

696
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,201
I'll never forgive you.

697
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:04,037
Try to understand, Alexia.

698
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,766
Understand what?

699
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,840
You make me swallow a lot of nonsense.

700
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:10,975
It's all Jim's fault.

701
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:14,009
He said he'd kill you
if I told the truth.

702
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:15,949
You're lying again!

703
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:20,979
I have to tell her.

704
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,216
Or she'll resent me even more.

705
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,428
We've thought it over.

706
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,198
Are we actors or aren't we?

707
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:41,733
Tell yourself it's a role

708
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:44,141
and Perla's your audience.

709
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,616
We've talked this over.
It can be done.

710
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,283
If you want,
I can play the director,

711
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,617
you're the lead actor.
You'll have to get up early.

712
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:03,363
Eli will handle the costumes,
Edward the props.

713
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:06,331
Come on, guys. This is outrageous.

714
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,798
You sure about this?

715
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,941
She'll never suspect a thing.

716
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:17,808
I know a printer. He can do magazines
with interviews and photos.

717
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:20,541
Her dreams will be full
of Grishenberg and Shylock.

718
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,826
I thought it was a sin to lie.

719
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:37,795
I worked it out with...

720
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,867
That's really great.

721
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,536
Look, I even had a sketch done.
Looks good, doesn't it?

722
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,275
- Mega realistic.
- What'll you do with that?

723
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:58,251
I'll explain.
Is my pal talented or not?

724
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,946
He's good, but aren't you overdoing it?

725
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:04,287
- Think how happy she'll be.
- It really looks great.

726
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:12,793
Gotta keep it simple.
This is too much.

727
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,395
Just a few interviews
about the shoot...

728
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:17,767
- We'll interview you.
- A few articles...

729
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,239
Sit down.

730
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:21,843
Benoit, take notes.

731
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,214
Are you glad Grishenberg
chose you to play Shylock?

732
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:32,049
Sure.

733
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,281
- Your salary?
- That sucks.

734
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:35,788
Why'd you accept the part?

735
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:37,957
It's a great part.

736
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,794
- That all?
- What can I say?

737
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,092
- Put something into it.
- Elaborate a bit.

738
00:56:44,267 --> 00:56:45,825
Ask good questions, then.

739
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:47,469
Do I take that down?

740
00:56:48,371 --> 00:56:51,135
Was it hard to get
inside your character?

741
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:53,002
Not bad.

742
00:56:53,176 --> 00:56:54,973
But it's his job.

743
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,407
You're always so critical.

744
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,412
It's Perla!

745
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:08,212
Yes, honey.

746
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:12,155
I'm whispering
because they're shooting.

747
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,014
I'm wanted on the set.
Gotta go.

748
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,277
- Maurice, are you ready?
- Yes, I'm here

749
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:46,186
Can anyone tell me what's going on?

750
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:26,557
I can't do that.

751
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:29,504
Maurice can only ask you.

752
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,664
He can't ask me to take part
in a lie. And to a sick person.

753
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,972
It's not a complicated costume to make.

754
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:39,671
Black with embroidering on the sides.

755
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:55,464
Perla asked about my costume.

756
00:58:57,967 --> 00:58:59,264
I don't sew anymore.

757
00:58:59,435 --> 00:59:02,461
I sell fabric. Can I still cut?
You never lose it.

758
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:05,733
Shame on you,
making them wait like this!

759
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:10,174
They want me to lie to poor Perla.
So?

760
00:59:23,493 --> 00:59:24,755
Let me hear it again.

761
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:32,459
What for?

762
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,501
I like the sound of Yiddish.

763
00:59:39,042 --> 00:59:43,103
Nothing's coming to me.

764
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:45,474
Do a scene you did already.

765
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:49,014
Sure...

766
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:56,152
A scene with all the Venetian extras,
500 or 600 of them...

767
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:57,691
You had lines in Yiddish?

768
00:59:58,561 --> 00:59:59,789
Of course.

769
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,095
You bet I did!

770
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,025
How'd you do it?

771
01:00:04,567 --> 01:00:06,034
Say them again for me, please.

772
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:14,334
Actually, in that scene...
Because I'm...

773
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:18,469
Actually I don't say much,
almost nothing.

774
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:21,239
I said..."Shoin."

775
01:00:23,486 --> 01:00:24,350
Is that all?

776
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,717
He cut a lot to keep
the general shot.

777
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,083
All I say is "shoin", but real loud.

778
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,563
- What about tomorrow?
- What about it?

779
01:00:35,031 --> 01:00:37,898
What're you shooting?
You're acting weird.

780
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:40,831
I'm bushed. I'm up early tomorrow.

781
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:55,174
Where'd I put the audition scene?

782
01:00:59,722 --> 01:01:02,714
Tomorrow we do the scene

783
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,052
with the chests.

784
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:08,129
Let's do it. What page?

785
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,361
If you think I look at that...

786
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,970
I work mainly with the Yiddish version.

787
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:18,736
- Where is it?
- It's not there?

788
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,513
Don't tell me I left it
in my dressing room.

789
01:01:29,852 --> 01:01:32,980
I know it by heart.
It'll be hard following you.

790
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,553
I know, I know.

791
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,558
Oh my God!

792
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:42,656
A big fat herring,

793
01:01:42,832 --> 01:01:44,925
crazy in the head...

794
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:49,060
Not like this, but that...

795
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:51,297
so there!

796
01:01:53,576 --> 01:01:56,101
Is that all?
That's all.

797
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:59,407
It's like nordic languages:
Everything's very succinct.

798
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:03,141
Anyhow, I have a super coach on the set.

799
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,618
Is she cute?

800
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,792
What's she like? Pretty?

801
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,823
She's okay.

802
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:21,399
She's a Yiddish teacher, that's all.

803
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:23,198
Then why are you flustered?

804
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:24,498
I'm not flustered.

805
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:27,373
I know you.

806
01:02:27,977 --> 01:02:32,437
Okay, she's pretty. But she doesn't do
anything for me, honestly.

807
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,376
If something happens to me...

808
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,845
I want you to know
that if you feel like...

809
01:02:41,491 --> 01:02:42,753
Hush!

810
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:46,991
Read the lines with me?

811
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:52,496
- What's your coach's name?
- She doesn't exist.

812
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,934
For me she doesn't exist.

813
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,199
So, we rehearse or go to sleep?

814
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,898
Okay, ready.

815
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:30,368
What do you like in a woman?

816
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,802
- Poise.
- And in a man?

817
01:03:32,942 --> 01:03:34,239
A sense of humor.

818
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,575
Your favorite scene in Merchant?

819
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:39,112
Rudy, okay

820
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,211
: Benoit
Okay?

821
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,719
I got it.

822
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,550
You can't film here.

823
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:51,318
Keep it up!
How's it going with...

824
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:01,899
Fuck you

825
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:03,402
Fuck you too

826
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,838
Come on!

827
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,974
I'm so glad Maurice got a day off.

828
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:15,412
They changed the schedule just for him.

829
01:04:15,585 --> 01:04:17,485
It wasn't easy but...

830
01:04:23,392 --> 01:04:25,360
Maurice is doing Shylock now?

831
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:32,096
I told you.

832
01:04:32,268 --> 01:04:35,237
You told me it was...

833
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:37,469
John Wood.

834
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:40,340
No, Maurice's playing Shylock.

835
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,709
Really?

836
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:44,569
You're pulling my leg.

837
01:04:45,348 --> 01:04:46,940
Maurice got the part.

838
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:48,447
You didn't know?

839
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,875
Benny said it was...

840
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:53,886
But finally it's Maurice.

841
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,983
But I thought...
I know, but, in fact, no!

842
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:04,763
I've got some good news.

843
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,792
You'll have scenes with Sean Connery.

844
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:10,599
Really?

845
01:05:10,773 --> 01:05:12,536
The production called today.

846
01:05:12,708 --> 01:05:15,040
He plays the judge
who sentences Shylock.

847
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,844
Okay.

848
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:20,676
Isn't that great?

849
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:23,250
I'm so glad Maurice is doing this film.

850
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:27,689
After this, you'll be world famous.

851
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:32,859
I hope I'll be around to see it.
Sure you will.

852
01:05:33,863 --> 01:05:36,491
Doron and Sarah called:
They're coming.

853
01:05:46,008 --> 01:05:48,408
What a day! Aren't we lucky?

854
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,139
I'm still surprised because...
Would you cut it out?

855
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,415
Have you lost your mind or what!

856
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:06,327
Maurice, it's 6:10.

857
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,563
Wake up, love.

858
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,896
Your driver will be here in 20 minutes.

859
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,306
Read your lines again?

860
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,103
He's a cheerful fellow...

861
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,012
but a big eater

862
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,750
and slow as a snail.

863
01:07:01,283 --> 01:07:02,409
Good morning

864
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:05,651
- Been clubbing?
- They closed at 4 a.m.

865
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,619
I tried to get some sleep.

866
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,416
Sorry.

867
01:07:10,726 --> 01:07:15,891
It'd be better if Sami picked you up.
He goes to temple every morning.

868
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,532
Drive. She's watching us.

869
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,632
- Where to?
- I dunno. Drive.

870
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,505
- What time is it?
- Must be 6:45.

871
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:28,409
6:45?

872
01:08:02,144 --> 01:08:04,271
We watched him from a distance.

873
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:07,883
He's a great Shylock.
We couldn't get near him.

874
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:11,978
At least Grishenberg
allowed us on the set.

875
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:16,724
You should see
how they all cater to Maurice.

876
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,819
- Tom Cruise came by the set.
- Really?

877
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:21,519
You were still at lunch.

878
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,187
We talked for an hour.

879
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:24,491
What's he like?

880
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:25,759
Very short.

881
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,904
Like a dog.
He comes up to here on me.

882
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:31,938
He has a huge staff.
It's really impressive.

883
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:36,374
Lots of charisma. Very nice.
Simple. Relaxed. Tanned.

884
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:40,276
I found him a bit obnoxious.
He said...

885
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,541
some obnoxious things.

886
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,880
He's on a first-name basis
with Grishenberg.

887
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:46,316
That's normal.

888
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:47,581
Sure,

889
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:49,781
they work together.

890
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:55,157
And his coach is a dish.

891
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,290
A real A-bomb.
She's not my coach, she's...

892
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:06,569
Jerk! Why mention my coach?
I didn't know what to say!

893
01:09:06,742 --> 01:09:09,040
Go on. I'll stay with her.

894
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,237
What am I doing here?

895
01:09:44,113 --> 01:09:46,707
I'm going home. She needs me.

896
01:09:46,882 --> 01:09:48,543
This sucks.
Forget it. It's impossible.

897
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,447
We've already discussed it.

898
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:55,851
You coming?

899
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,855
What for?
I have nothing to do in there.

900
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,989
Go on, I'm fine.
You sure?

901
01:10:02,164 --> 01:10:03,256
I'll wait for you.

902
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:06,890
As you like.

903
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:24,614
Want to put on tefillin?

904
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:26,652
I'm not interested.

905
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:31,222
Try it.
He might be more merciful.

906
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:34,089
It's not a business.
I'm not trading things.

907
01:10:51,013 --> 01:10:52,241
Hand me the bottle.

908
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:57,446
I'll have to go home in costume.
If she suspects something...

909
01:10:57,620 --> 01:11:00,612
She say anything?
No, but it's just as well.

910
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,521
I couldn't have stayed home all this time.

911
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:05,551
You shouldn't drink like that.

912
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,124
Stand up straight.

913
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,115
"I am a Jew.

914
01:12:13,429 --> 01:12:15,522
"Hath not a Jew eyes?

915
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,198
"Hath not a Jew hands,

916
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:22,334
"organs?

917
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:27,166
"Dimensions, senses,
affections, passions?

918
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:30,873
"Fed with the same food...

919
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:40,083
"hurt with the same
weapons,

920
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:46,619
"subject to the same diseases,

921
01:12:46,795 --> 01:12:49,730
"healed by the same means,

922
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:54,725
"warmed and cooled

923
01:12:56,872 --> 01:13:01,332
"by the same winter and summer,
as a Christian is?

924
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:06,510
"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

925
01:13:10,652 --> 01:13:12,745
"If you poison us,
do we not die?"

926
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:42,816
How're you doing?

927
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,949
Everything okay?

928
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:49,056
Why are you dressed like that?

929
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:50,088
I want to see her.

930
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:53,228
- She's sleeping.
- You smell of liquor.

931
01:13:53,395 --> 01:13:54,327
I'll explain.

932
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:56,487
Tell me what's going on.

933
01:13:58,634 --> 01:14:03,128
For 5 weeks you've been feeding
my sister all this crap?

934
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:04,272
Yes

935
01:14:05,507 --> 01:14:06,701
She swallowed it?

936
01:14:07,342 --> 01:14:09,674
Yeah, I didn't know how to...

937
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:12,279
You must tell her the truth.
I'll tell her.

938
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:17,012
What's the point now?
It's made her so happy.

939
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,653
He's been lying to her for 5 weeks!

940
01:14:22,925 --> 01:14:24,654
This can't go on. I'm telling her.

941
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,196
No

942
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:31,764
What do you like in a woman?
Poise.

943
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:35,597
And in a man?
A sense of humor.

944
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:42,233
He's making a film
with Rudolph Grishenberg.

945
01:14:45,781 --> 01:14:47,009
That's great.

946
01:14:50,352 --> 01:14:52,081
You'd think he'd been doing it
all his life.

947
01:14:56,124 --> 01:14:57,785
I keep dreaming of Grishenberg.

948
01:14:59,428 --> 01:15:01,828
It's Maurice's fault,
he always talks about him.

949
01:15:05,968 --> 01:15:08,994
We'll have to wait till I get better,
but...

950
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:15,170
I'd love to meet him.

951
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:24,042
- Don't touch.
- Just looking.

952
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:26,949
- But don't touch.
- I'm not, but...

953
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,386
- It seats how many?
- 5 or 6.

954
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,562
Stop it! Calm down!

955
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:48,398
Nice work!

956
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:04,351
Morning, sir

957
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:08,522
George!

958
01:16:12,734 --> 01:16:14,224
Step on it!

959
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:17,666
Shit!

960
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,767
Can't do that, are you crazy?

961
01:16:23,946 --> 01:16:24,970
Shut up

962
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,079
Are your crazy too

963
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,977
He says shut up, are we nuts?

964
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,641
You were to turn right.
Right, Sami!

965
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:32,287
What?

966
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:35,154
Because I've been kipnapped
by Maurice Kurtz...

967
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,621
who wants me to tell his wife...

968
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:38,453
that he is playing Shylock

969
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:43,189
We are going to... Maurice Kurtz,
Maurice Kurtz

970
01:16:45,267 --> 01:16:47,292
My wife's ill. Just a little lie.

971
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:48,458
I can't

972
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:49,365
Why not?

973
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:52,234
I can't lie, I'm American

974
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:54,671
What'd he say?
He can't lie, he's American.

975
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:55,502
So what?

976
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:56,939
Americans don't lie

977
01:16:57,112 --> 01:17:00,673
- Americans don't lie.
- Are you kidding?

978
01:17:00,849 --> 01:17:01,838
Fuck you

979
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:07,813
It's for you.

980
01:17:11,159 --> 01:17:13,024
If you need anything, I'm next door.

981
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:47,856
This game has gone long enough

982
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:51,329
You turn this car around.
You take me back to hotel immediately

983
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:52,894
You know what you are doing?

984
01:17:53,702 --> 01:17:54,327
In two hours time,

985
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,937
you will be in news broadcast
all over the world

986
01:17:57,305 --> 01:18:00,206
You are looking for big, big trouble.

987
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,605
Sami, turn around.
We'll take him back.

988
01:18:04,780 --> 01:18:06,873
This has gone far enough.

989
01:18:09,117 --> 01:18:10,948
I said, turn around!

990
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,280
This isn't a Mini! You're nuts.

991
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:46,749
When you get a haircut,
it makes headlines.

992
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:49,482
We're just ordinary people.

993
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:54,027
Maurice is a hero, a nameless hero.
So no one gives a damn.

994
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:59,129
Who, besides you and us, will know all
he's done to make his wife happy?

995
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:04,068
We see you sponsor foundations
and humanitarian associations,

996
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,070
but we don't know
how you treat your wife.

997
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:09,168
- I can't lie.
- Who's asking you to lie?

998
01:19:09,845 --> 01:19:12,541
It's a show for one person's dreams.

999
01:19:12,714 --> 01:19:17,083
The great role Maurice never got,
he's been playing for his wife.

1000
01:19:17,252 --> 01:19:19,049
It's the role of his life.

1001
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:25,124
He just wants you as a guest star.
It's no lie, it's showbiz.

1002
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:29,593
Acting isn't lying. It's the only time
when you don't lie.

1003
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,029
I don't want to argue with you.
I want to go back to my hotel

1004
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:38,366
The week's film event is
R. Grishenberg's new picture.

1005
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:41,441
We met him in Paris.

1006
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,943
Thank you for agreeing
to this interview.

1007
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:47,274
Aren't you afraid of alienating your fans

1008
01:19:47,449 --> 01:19:51,146
by doing this film entirely in Yiddish?

1009
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:57,787
Merchant of Venice is the most
problematic Shakespeare play.

1010
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:03,454
But with the Middle East situation
and anti-Semitism, the time is right.

1011
01:20:03,632 --> 01:20:06,533
I've made so many movies to entertain.

1012
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:10,102
I think I can make films
closer to me in Yiddish.

1013
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,103
I hope the public will come.

1014
01:20:12,274 --> 01:20:15,675
As usual you've cast big-name talent

1015
01:20:15,844 --> 01:20:18,312
to play the lead roles.

1016
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:22,581
Stars are the locomotives of Hollywood.

1017
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:27,552
By using them,
I can shoot any subject I please

1018
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,349
without the producer on my back.

1019
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:32,516
So John Woodward's playing Shylock.

1020
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:40,725
Sure, if you'd asked the production...

1021
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:43,496
I'd have said yes.
I visit hospitals sometimes

1022
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,941
Maurice, I'm sorry.

1023
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:49,843
My film is waiting

1024
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:53,713
We grew up with all your films.

1025
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,677
They taught us how to talk to girls.

1026
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:01,885
We all wanted to be actors
because of your films.

1027
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:03,718
We've memorized your interviews.

1028
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:08,522
You were this close to casting Maurice.

1029
01:21:08,997 --> 01:21:10,988
That means something.
You owe him.

1030
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:14,829
We're just asking for five minutes
of your time.

1031
01:21:15,003 --> 01:21:18,029
It's not asking for the moon.

1032
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:21,126
He is my friend Maurice

1033
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:24,696
Debbie, not now

1034
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:26,135
Sixth floor.

1035
01:22:31,746 --> 01:22:34,044
Now what do we do?
It was a false alarm.

1036
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:39,411
We do nothing. Know who is he?
Want the Americans bombing Paris?

1037
01:22:40,255 --> 01:22:41,449
He'll be back down.

1038
01:23:10,085 --> 01:23:12,280
This is Perla, my wife

1039
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:14,612
Hello, Perla

1040
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:17,357
I was giving Maurice a ride home...

1041
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,323
I thought it would be nice to meet you

1042
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,122
He is a fabulous actor

1043
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:27,333
A magnificent Shylock

1044
01:23:29,738 --> 01:23:31,069
I love working with him

1045
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,597
I am lucky to have met him

1046
01:23:37,212 --> 01:23:40,511
I think he is lucky to have met you

1047
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,018
He loves you very much, you know?

1048
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,654
I know

1049
01:23:52,594 --> 01:23:54,994
I think you must be a very special person

1050
01:23:58,166 --> 01:24:01,294
to deserve someone who loves you...

1051
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:02,868
the way he loves you

1052
01:24:05,807 --> 01:24:10,369
We don't all get the chance to enjoy
such a love in our life

1053
01:24:13,982 --> 01:24:15,973
We can miss out on everything

1054
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:25,491
if we manage to love, really love...

1055
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,388
we make a success in our life

1056
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:34,232
That's what remains

1057
01:24:42,077 --> 01:24:44,068
It is very moving to me today

1058
01:24:45,814 --> 01:24:48,806
I am grateful that Maurice told me that...

1059
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,780
how much you wanted to meet me.

1060
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:57,554
Really, the honour is mine

1061
01:25:25,553 --> 01:25:27,145
Thank you.

1062
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:05,181
What're you doing?
Learning it by heart?

1063
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:09,490
I dubbed him in Yiddish.
We know, we saw it four times.

1064
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,963
You coming?
I don't want to eat at the counter.

1065
01:26:13,134 --> 01:26:15,159
Think you'll do his next film?

1066
01:26:15,670 --> 01:26:17,934
If Al Pacino's not free, maybe.

1067
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:21,342
By the way, Sarah had a boy.

1068
01:26:21,509 --> 01:26:23,534
What's his name?
Dunno. He doesn't speak yet.

1069
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:25,941
It's a sin to tell
before circumcision.

1070
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:29,413
Come on, one more!

1071
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:33,545
There!

1072
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:40,160
I always wondered
if you suspected something.

1073
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:43,127
If you're not hungry, say so!

1074
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,060
I'm coming!

1075
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:49,902
Anyhow, there's always a wait.

1076
01:26:50,071 --> 01:26:52,972
Because we're always late!

1077
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:57,703
What're you stopping for?
Move it, or forget the restaurant.

1078
01:26:57,879 --> 01:27:00,677
What're you so worked up for?

1079
01:27:00,848 --> 01:27:03,373
- We're hungry!
- Here I am!

1080
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:05,477
So let's go!

1081
01:27:08,656 --> 01:27:12,057
How I miss you, my love.
How I miss you.
