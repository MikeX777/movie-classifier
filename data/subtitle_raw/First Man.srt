2
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:31,652
20 seconds to drop.

3
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:35,421
Arm switch light, check.

4
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,490
Brakes out, check.

5
00:01:41,862 --> 00:01:43,028
What's your mixing chambers?

6
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,562
Real rough up here,

7
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,698
fluctuating a half degree
on each side.

8
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,101
I see that.

9
00:01:50,637 --> 00:01:52,237
Ten seconds.

10
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:04,950
Good on track, 15...

11
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:39,314
...a visual estimate
of your location?

12
00:03:41,183 --> 00:03:42,749
Okay. 140,000 feet.

13
00:03:42,751 --> 00:03:44,686
On your way down.

14
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:55,028
Approaching 115,000 feet.

15
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:57,731
Should be regaining
aerodynamic controls.

16
00:03:59,168 --> 00:04:01,034
Right turn.

17
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:09,812
We show you ballooning,
not turning.

18
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:19,887
Altitude rising.

19
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:21,857
A lot more right.

20
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,160
Neil, you're bouncing
off the atmosphere.

21
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:35,069
The
altitude's still rising, Neil.

22
00:05:35,266 --> 00:05:36,865
You're gonna have to

23
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:37,902
stretch out your glide.

24
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,741
You seem to be a tad short.

25
00:05:51,814 --> 00:05:53,751
Stow your flaps down, Neil.

26
00:06:18,476 --> 00:06:20,245
I'm down.

27
00:06:23,013 --> 00:06:24,482
Roger.

28
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,441
All right, let's get him out.

29
00:06:54,246 --> 00:06:55,245
I'll step up in there.

30
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,248
You okay?

31
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,918
Yeah.

32
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,288
Okay, Neil.

33
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,057
Kid's a good engineer.

34
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,427
But he's distracted.

35
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:14,097
He got home, Chuck.
He bounced off the atmosphere

36
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,598
and still figured out
how to get home.

37
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,601
Third mishap this month.

38
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:20,373
Bikle should ground him
before he hurts himself.

39
00:08:03,048 --> 00:08:04,448
There you go.

40
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,619
It's okay.

41
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,019
It's okay, sweetheart.

42
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:11,857
It's okay. Come here, come here.

43
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,091
Okay.

44
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,940
What's that?

45
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:33,112
Look. Who's that?

46
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:41,854
Is that a kite?

47
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,389
Does that fly in the sky?

48
00:08:45,391 --> 00:08:47,257
Yeah.

49
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,262
How?

50
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:53,533
♪ I see the Moon

51
00:08:55,469 --> 00:08:58,536
♪ The Moon sees me

52
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,039
♪ Down through the leaves

53
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,378

♪ Shine on the one I love.

57
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:21,191
<i>Maybe I should talk</i>

58
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,694
<i>to Dr. Johns about it.</i>

59
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:24,396
Who?

60
00:09:24,398 --> 00:09:27,030
Dr. Harold Johns.

61
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:29,434
He developed a procedure
in Saskatchewan.

62
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,604
So you'd go to Canada?

63
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,239
I guess I would
take some time off.

64
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,241
Why don't you
talk to the hospital?

65
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:39,277
- See if the tumor might be...
- I spoke to them already.

66
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,713
I'm sorry, Neil.

67
00:09:40,715 --> 00:09:42,748
I wish I had more to offer.

68
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,216
That's okay, Jack.

69
00:09:44,218 --> 00:09:45,650
Uh, appreciate it.

70
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,986
- Of course.
- Give my love to June.

71
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:49,388
- You got it.
- Okay.

72
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,588
- Bye, now.
- Bye.

73
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:12,077
Now, who made that?
You or Grace?

74
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,179
Grace did.

75
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:14,747
I'll take it, then.

76
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:17,081
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

77
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,784
Dick Day called from Houston.

78
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,519
He was asking after you.

79
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,421
That about Gemini?

80
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:24,190
They're looking for pilots

81
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:26,292
with a solid background
in engineering.

82
00:10:27,762 --> 00:10:31,464
Well, maybe once Karen
starts feeling better.

83
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:34,602
Just, you know, I wouldn't want
to move her until then.

84
00:10:36,772 --> 00:10:39,405
Well, it would be nice
to keep you around.

85
00:10:39,407 --> 00:10:41,808
- Enjoy the casserole.
- Thank you.

86
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,445
You're welcome.

87
00:10:44,545 --> 00:10:45,811
Joe.

88
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:47,146
Hey, Jan.

89
00:10:47,148 --> 00:10:48,782
You, uh, hanging in?

90
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:51,252
Oh, you know.

91
00:10:52,553 --> 00:10:54,721
It's nice of you to come by.

92
00:10:54,723 --> 00:10:56,491
Of course.

93
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,028
Night, now.

94
00:12:06,729 --> 00:12:08,862
- Thank you so much.
- Absolutely.

95
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:22,845
Dad, want to come play?

96
00:12:26,816 --> 00:12:28,851
I should, um...

97
00:12:30,186 --> 00:12:32,255
I have to help your mother.

98
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,179
I thought I might go to work.

99
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:10,454
Okay.

100
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:28,738
They're gonna use
VTOL technology.

101
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:29,939
They won't even
have figured out

102
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:32,409
how to get there yet. I'm not
gonna waste my time on...

103
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,580
Morning.

104
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:39,749
Neil.

105
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:43,286
You can take a few days off,
you know.

106
00:14:43,288 --> 00:14:45,021
I know.

107
00:14:45,023 --> 00:14:49,995
I'm just getting up to speed on
the new delta wing in the UK.

108
00:14:51,763 --> 00:14:53,665
Bikle canceled the trip.

109
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:57,033
He wants you focused
on writing up

110
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:59,471
the pilot report
from your last flight.

111
00:15:06,511 --> 00:15:07,880
Am I grounded, Joe?

112
00:15:10,849 --> 00:15:13,284
Write up the report
on the bounce, okay?

113
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,604
Thank you, sir.

114
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:14,745
Civilian?

115
00:16:14,747 --> 00:16:17,681
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Me, too.

116
00:16:17,683 --> 00:16:19,550
Elliot.

117
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:20,519
Neil.

118
00:16:22,621 --> 00:16:24,388
Tough morning, huh?

119
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:27,591
I barely lasted two minutes
in that ice bath.

120
00:16:27,593 --> 00:16:29,828
Course, I suppose
NASA's more interested

121
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,531
in the psychological reaction.

122
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:34,631
Well...

123
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:38,437
I think I made it pretty clear
that I thought it was cold.

124
00:16:41,775 --> 00:16:42,776
Armstrong.

125
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,413
- Good luck.
- You, too.

126
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,450
Another egghead.

127
00:16:53,452 --> 00:16:54,819
<i>Neil, we've been chatting</i>

128
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:56,486
<i>with candidates
about the program.</i>

129
00:16:56,488 --> 00:17:00,124
As you know, our decision
to forgo direct ascent

130
00:17:00,126 --> 00:17:01,826
in favor of a lunar orbit
rendezvous approach

131
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:03,094
to the eventual Moon mission

132
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:05,430
has had a major impact
on Gemini.

133
00:17:05,432 --> 00:17:07,933
Do you have any thoughts
on that decision?

134
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:11,102
Well, even considering
von Braun's initial criticism,

135
00:17:11,104 --> 00:17:13,172
it seems that the payload saved

136
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:15,773
by parking the primary vehicle
in orbit

137
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,843
and sending a smaller ship down
to the lunar surface

138
00:17:18,845 --> 00:17:21,079
is well worth
the resulting challenges.

139
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,547
What do you see
as the challenges?

140
00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:24,482
Cislunar navigation, for one.

141
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,150
And rendezvous and docking.

142
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:27,954
Why do you think
space flight's important?

143
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,591
I had a few, uh,
opportunities in the X-15

144
00:17:33,593 --> 00:17:36,795
to observe the atmosphere.

145
00:17:36,797 --> 00:17:41,000
It was so thin,
such a small part of the Earth,

146
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:42,902
you could barely see it at all.

147
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:44,602
And when you're down here
in the crowd

148
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,771
and you look up, it...
it looks pretty big,

149
00:17:46,773 --> 00:17:48,607
and you don't think
about it too much.

150
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,776
But when you get
a different vantage point,

151
00:17:51,778 --> 00:17:54,815
it changes your perspective.

152
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,920
I don't know what
space exploration will uncover,

153
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:03,155
but I don't think
it'll be exploration

154
00:18:03,157 --> 00:18:06,058
just for the sake
of exploration.

155
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,730
I think it'll be more the fact
that it allows us to see things

156
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:15,600
that maybe we should have seen
a long time ago

157
00:18:15,602 --> 00:18:19,674
but just haven't been able to
until now.

158
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:25,678
- Does anyone have anything else?
- Yeah.

159
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,882
Neil, I was sorry to hear
about your daughter.

160
00:18:30,718 --> 00:18:33,719
I'm sorry, is there a question?

161
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:37,791
Um, what I...
what I mean is, uh,

162
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,694
do you think
it will have an effect?

163
00:18:43,632 --> 00:18:47,000
I think it would be
unreasonable to assume

164
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:49,671
that it wouldn't have
some effect.

165
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:52,671
All right, Neil.

166
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,574
Thank you. That's fine.

167
00:18:54,576 --> 00:18:56,208
Thank you.

168
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:58,646
Thank you for your time.

169
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,522
Hello?

170
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:09,858
Yeah, sure. Neil.

171
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:11,958
Hello?

172
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,059
Can I go play outside?

173
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:14,963
Yeah.

174
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,899
Yes, sir.

175
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:22,004
Thank you, sir.

176
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,176
I got it.

177
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:36,618
It's a fresh start.

178
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:39,721
Are you sure?

179
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,758
Yeah.

180
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,531
Hey.

181
00:19:50,632 --> 00:19:52,601
It'll be an adventure.

182
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:12,153
<i>Since the time of Jules Verne,</i>

183
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:15,056
<i>man has imagined
traveling to the Moon.</i>

184
00:20:15,058 --> 00:20:17,758
<i>The old idea of how to get
to the Moon</i>

185
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,995
<i>was to send one spacecraft
all the way there and back.</i>

186
00:20:20,997 --> 00:20:24,665
<i>However, NASA engineers have
developed a modern approach</i>

187
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:27,168
<i>where one rocket
contains several ships</i>

188
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,770
<i>that will make the journey
together.</i>

189
00:20:29,772 --> 00:20:31,705
<i>Just as Columbus took a rowboat</i>

190
00:20:31,707 --> 00:20:34,742
<i>from the</i> Santa María
<i>to the shore of the New World,</i>

191
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:37,145
<i>the astronauts will take
a smaller spacecraft</i>

192
00:20:37,147 --> 00:20:40,147
<i>from the mother ship
down to the lunar surface.</i>

193
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:42,150
<i>When it's time to return,</i>

194
00:20:42,152 --> 00:20:44,852
<i>the smaller craft will lift off
from the surface</i>

195
00:20:44,854 --> 00:20:46,720
<i>and dock with the mother ship,</i>

196
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:49,157
<i>which will then power the crew
back to Earth.</i>

197
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:51,959
<i>Thus, thanks to
the brilliant minds of NASA,</i>

198
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:54,695
<i>the age-old dream of going
to the Moon</i>

199
00:20:54,697 --> 00:20:57,033
<i>will soon be achieved.</i>

200
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:07,709
<i>Sputnik, Sputnik 2,</i>

201
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,412
Vostok, Gagarin.

202
00:21:10,414 --> 00:21:12,147
The Soviets have beaten us

203
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:14,715
at every single major
space accomplishment.

204
00:21:14,717 --> 00:21:16,451
Our program couldn't compete.

205
00:21:16,453 --> 00:21:19,688
So we've chosen to focus
on a job so difficult,

206
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,390
requiring so many
technological developments,

207
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:25,826
that the Russians are gonna
have to start from scratch.

208
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:27,331
As will we.

209
00:21:31,168 --> 00:21:32,400
Hi.

210
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,701
- Hi.
- I'm Pat.

211
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:35,036
Got here about a week
before you,

212
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:36,405
so welcome to the neighborhood.

213
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:38,907
Oh, that's so nice of you.

214
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:40,208
- Well, it's...
- I'm Janet.

215
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:42,311
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

216
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:45,048
So, instead of here, we go...

217
00:21:51,455 --> 00:21:53,056
Hey.

218
00:22:06,204 --> 00:22:07,403
Here.

219
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:10,038
That's to scale. Check it.

220
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,141
That's my husband, Ed,
and that's Eddie Junior.

221
00:22:12,143 --> 00:22:14,142
I don't know where Bonnie is.

222
00:22:14,144 --> 00:22:16,145
- You've got two?
- I do.

223
00:22:16,147 --> 00:22:18,414
I see...
Is this your first one?

224
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,881
Oh, no, no.

225
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:21,450
We've got a boy, Rick.

226
00:22:21,452 --> 00:22:23,052
How old is he?

227
00:22:23,054 --> 00:22:24,787
He's five and a half.

228
00:22:24,789 --> 00:22:26,054
Oh, well, we should get them
together.

229
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:27,956
If we want to get this done,

230
00:22:27,958 --> 00:22:29,525
we need to prove that two ships

231
00:22:29,527 --> 00:22:32,928
can find each other in orbit
and dock without crashing.

232
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,164
That's the primary mission
of Project Gemini.

233
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,999
When we think you're ready,

234
00:22:37,001 --> 00:22:40,169
each of you will be assigned
a flight with a specific task.

235
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:41,871
Only after we master
all these tasks

236
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:43,540
do we move on to Apollo,

237
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,875
consider trying to land
on the Moon.

238
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:47,376
- It's nice to meet you.
- And you, Pat.

239
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:49,811
- Bye.
- Bye.

240
00:22:49,813 --> 00:22:51,847
- Eddie, you put that down.
- <i>Gus.</i>

241
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:53,316
Eddie Junior, don't you dare...

242
00:22:53,318 --> 00:22:54,386
You got anything to add?

243
00:22:55,521 --> 00:22:57,386
Just do your job.

244
00:22:57,388 --> 00:22:58,923
Yes, sir.

245
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:02,091
Almost to scale.

246
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:03,993
The Multi-Axis Trainer

247
00:23:03,995 --> 00:23:07,863
was designed to replicate
roll coupling on three axes,

248
00:23:07,865 --> 00:23:11,268
the kind you might
encounter in space.

249
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,936
The challenge
is to stabilize the machine

250
00:23:13,938 --> 00:23:16,138
before you pass out.

251
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,978
First victim, Armstrong.

252
00:25:05,418 --> 00:25:07,219
White, you're up.

253
00:25:07,221 --> 00:25:09,087
Yeah, I got it.

254
00:25:09,089 --> 00:25:10,256
I'm okay.

255
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:14,894
Let's go again.

256
00:25:40,354 --> 00:25:41,687
Oh, fuck.

257
00:25:57,671 --> 00:26:00,372
Gentlemen, welcome
to Basic Rocket Physics.

258
00:26:00,374 --> 00:26:03,742
We'll just be covering
the first chapter tonight.

259
00:26:03,744 --> 00:26:06,546
When using a multi-stage
launch vehicle,

260
00:26:06,548 --> 00:26:08,313
it's necessary to determine

261
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:11,049
what the right sizing is
of those stages.

262
00:26:49,424 --> 00:26:52,059
- Hi.
- Hi.

263
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,261
You okay?

264
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:57,764
Yeah.

265
00:26:57,766 --> 00:27:00,433
Just thinking
about this lecture.

266
00:27:00,435 --> 00:27:02,571
It's kind of neat.

267
00:27:04,806 --> 00:27:07,008
What's neat about it?

268
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:13,447
Well, it was about how
to rendezvous with the Agena.

269
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:16,049
If you thrust,
it-it actually slows you down,

270
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,651
because it puts you
into a higher orbit,

271
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:19,353
so you have to reduce thrust

272
00:27:19,355 --> 00:27:21,588
and drop into a lower orbit
in order to catch up.

273
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:24,558
It's-it's backwards from what
they teach you as a pilot,

274
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,331
but if you work the math,
it-it-it follows.

275
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,234
It's kind of neat.

276
00:27:34,102 --> 00:27:36,202
Yeah.

277
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:37,504
What's funny?

278
00:27:37,506 --> 00:27:40,008
No, it's not funny.
It's just...

279
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:43,745
It's kind of neat.

280
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,271
Do you remember this?

281
00:28:10,506 --> 00:28:12,439
Yeah.

282
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,777
I'm surprised
that you remember it.

283
00:29:05,562 --> 00:29:08,262
♪ If you miss
the train I'm on... ♪

284
00:29:08,264 --> 00:29:10,899
Let's see. I want to make ten.

285
00:29:10,901 --> 00:29:13,367
Before you panic...

286
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:14,769
There we go.

287
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:16,438
Great. Thank you.

288
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,572
Thank you for having us.

289
00:29:17,574 --> 00:29:19,307
It's a pleasure.

290
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:20,675
Carrie.

291
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,444
Here you go.
Would you like some salad?

292
00:29:22,446 --> 00:29:24,412
- Thank you.
- That's a lovely piano, Pat.

293
00:29:24,414 --> 00:29:26,915
- Do you play?
- Bonnie's taking lessons.

294
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:28,918
- Mm.
- Well, perhaps we'll sing

295
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,454
for our supper.

296
00:29:31,888 --> 00:29:33,254
Neil plays piano?

297
00:29:33,256 --> 00:29:34,656
Neil knows all kinds
of show tunes.

298
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:37,225
- Janet.
- Oh, come on.

299
00:29:37,227 --> 00:29:38,493
He was musical director
at his fraternity in college.

300
00:29:38,495 --> 00:29:39,794
- Honey.
- Yeah, he wrote the musical

301
00:29:39,796 --> 00:29:41,664
for the all-student revue.

302
00:29:41,666 --> 00:29:43,231
- I didn't write the music.
- Yeah, you did.

303
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:46,434
No, I... We used music
from Gilbert and Sullivan.

304
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,236
Well, he wrote all new lyrics.

305
00:29:48,238 --> 00:29:50,940
"The Land of Egelloc."

306
00:29:50,942 --> 00:29:52,775
It was quite funny.

307
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:56,244
"The Land of Egelloc"?

308
00:29:56,246 --> 00:29:57,512
- Egelloc.
- Mm-hmm.

309
00:29:57,514 --> 00:29:58,848
You've never heard of it?

310
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,616
I-I haven't.

311
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:03,251
Oh, I'm surprised.
Uh, uh, it's a distant land,

312
00:30:03,253 --> 00:30:04,920
but, uh, it's a magical place.

313
00:30:04,922 --> 00:30:06,524
It's "college"
spelled backwards.

314
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,562
Seriously?

315
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:13,963
Yep.

316
00:30:18,436 --> 00:30:20,836
You're, uh,
backup on Five, huh?

317
00:30:20,838 --> 00:30:22,405
- Yeah.
- Well, don't worry.

318
00:30:22,407 --> 00:30:23,773
You'll get
your own mission soon.

319
00:30:23,775 --> 00:30:25,407
How's training going on Four?

320
00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:26,441
It's good.

321
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:27,810
I think we're close on E.V.A.

322
00:30:27,812 --> 00:30:30,013
First man to walk in space.

323
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:32,247
- That'd be something, huh?
- Yeah.

324
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:34,417
Well, you know the walking's
the easy part.

325
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:36,753
- It's getting back inside that's tough.
- Mm.

326
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,354
It'd be a hell of a ride

327
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:39,789
to come back
with my tail hanging out.

328
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:40,790
Oh, I think McDivitt

329
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,826
will cut the cord
before that ever happens.

330
00:30:42,828 --> 00:30:44,794
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You
throttle back there, Armstrong.

331
00:30:44,796 --> 00:30:45,895
Ed!

332
00:30:45,897 --> 00:30:47,296
- Yeah?
- Phone for you.

333
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:48,865
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's Deke.

334
00:30:48,867 --> 00:30:50,399
Okay, hang on.

335
00:30:50,401 --> 00:30:51,667
I think that's
Castor and Pollux.

336
00:30:52,938 --> 00:30:55,438
I was testing you,
and you passed.

337
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,506
I thought about
letting it fly, but...

338
00:30:57,508 --> 00:30:58,709
Yeah.

339
00:30:58,711 --> 00:31:00,211
Yeah.

340
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:06,016
Uh, no, uh,
let me turn it on right now.

341
00:31:06,018 --> 00:31:07,151
Hey, guys.

342
00:31:07,153 --> 00:31:09,920
...with a Soviet pressure suit,

343
00:31:09,922 --> 00:31:11,788
we're told, that was designed
for the lunar surface.

344
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,889
- I'll call you back.
- This is, of course,

345
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:14,925
mankind's first E.V.A.,

346
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:17,461
or extravehicular activity.

347
00:31:17,463 --> 00:31:19,695
Within the American
space program,

348
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:22,632
E.V.A. is seen as one
of the crucial tests

349
00:31:22,634 --> 00:31:25,634
the astronauts must master
if they are to successfully

350
00:31:25,636 --> 00:31:27,838
carry out their mission
to the Moon.

351
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,041
Astronaut Ed White
was scheduled

352
00:31:30,043 --> 00:31:32,508
to perform the first E.V.A.

353
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,977
during Gemini 4.

354
00:31:33,979 --> 00:31:36,313
So this is yet another
major victory

355
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:38,849
for the Soviet Union
in the Space Race.

356
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:46,690
Check valves are clear.

357
00:31:46,692 --> 00:31:47,992
Okay. I'll get on the edge.

358
00:31:47,994 --> 00:31:51,394
- We got it from here.
- Thanks.

359
00:31:51,396 --> 00:31:53,398
Thanks, Elliot.

360
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:02,873
<i>Eight days up there.</i>

361
00:32:02,875 --> 00:32:04,976
To be honest, I'm kind of glad
we didn't get this one.

362
00:32:04,978 --> 00:32:07,446
Hope they don't
kill each other.

363
00:32:09,115 --> 00:32:10,815
At least it'd be quieter
around here.

364
00:32:20,726 --> 00:32:22,693
Neil.

365
00:32:22,695 --> 00:32:24,061
Go ahead.

366
00:32:24,063 --> 00:32:27,364
Neil Armstrong,
our backup commander.

367
00:32:27,366 --> 00:32:28,499
Buzz Aldrin.

368
00:32:28,501 --> 00:32:29,834
Roger Chaffee.

369
00:32:29,836 --> 00:32:31,036
Couple of greenhorns
from third group.

370
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:32,569
They'll be at blockhouse
for launch.

371
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,839
Listen, can I speak to you
for a minute?

372
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:36,609
Fellas.

373
00:32:41,447 --> 00:32:44,115
We're putting you
in command of Gemini 8.

374
00:32:44,117 --> 00:32:47,018
Dave Scott is gonna be
your pilot.

375
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,454
We get the Agena back online,

376
00:32:50,456 --> 00:32:52,759
you're probably gonna be
the first to dock.

377
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:00,732
Don't worry about Elliot.

378
00:33:00,734 --> 00:33:02,600
We'll put that brain
of his to work.

379
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:04,702
We've got a big E.V.A.
planned for Eight.

380
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:06,472
Dave's a workhorse.

381
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:08,940
Yes, sir.

382
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,045
- I'll talk to you later today.
- Thank you.

383
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:25,489
My eye!

384
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:27,458
Oh, my eye!

385
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,694
My eye!

386
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:31,129
Mr. Armstrong.

387
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:32,496
When did you start swimming?

388
00:33:32,498 --> 00:33:33,564
I don't remember exactly.

389
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:35,567
- I think school.
- In high school?

390
00:33:35,569 --> 00:33:37,870
Yeah, and we had a...
we, uh...

391
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:39,671
like, a summer house
in northern Wisconsin,

392
00:33:39,673 --> 00:33:42,141
and I just used to go
to the lake and, uh, fish.

393
00:33:42,143 --> 00:33:44,508
And I just used to swim
for miles and miles.

394
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,146
I've-I've always loved it.

395
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:49,915
Nothing quite compares

396
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,183
to your terrible life.

397
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:55,654
Oh...

398
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:57,024
You got it coming.

399
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:05,098
It's the longest bridge
in the world, but there's no...

400
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,498
It's the second-largest
suspension bridge in the world,

401
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,969
but these cables are the longest...

402
00:34:10,704 --> 00:34:12,639
- Hey, Ed.
- Oh, hi.

403
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:14,506
Uh, can I speak with Neil?

404
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:16,075
Yeah, sure.
Why don't you come on in?

405
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:17,643
You're soaked.

406
00:34:17,645 --> 00:34:19,912
No, I'll-I'll...
I'll wait here.

407
00:34:19,914 --> 00:34:22,081
Thanks.

408
00:34:22,083 --> 00:34:23,650
You could fly under there.

409
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:25,784
That would hurt
if you jumped under it.

410
00:34:25,786 --> 00:34:27,619
- What's that?
- That would hurt

411
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:30,256
if you jumped over it.

412
00:34:30,258 --> 00:34:32,125
Yeah.

413
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:33,592
Uh, here are the sky pieces.

414
00:34:33,594 --> 00:34:34,961
Neil, Ed's outside.

415
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:36,162
Okay.

416
00:34:36,164 --> 00:34:37,598
Excuse me, son.

417
00:34:39,533 --> 00:34:41,067
Hi.

418
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:42,769
You want to come in?

419
00:34:42,771 --> 00:34:44,538
Some bad news about Elliot.

420
00:34:48,877 --> 00:34:51,543
No, I know. Deke told me
he bumped him, but with...

421
00:34:51,545 --> 00:34:52,979
Neil, Elliot and Charlie
were flying

422
00:34:52,981 --> 00:34:54,614
into St. Louis this morning.

423
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:56,851
Their T-38 crashed on approach.

424
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,825
Oh.

425
00:35:08,163 --> 00:35:10,098
There was a lot of fog.

426
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,615
So, did you really fly
under that bridge?

427
00:35:33,755 --> 00:35:36,123
Was it fun?

428
00:35:36,125 --> 00:35:38,624
Were you scared?

429
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:41,128
Ricky. Honey.

430
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,064
Why don't you go and get your
homework so I can check it?

431
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:45,600
Yes, ma'am.

432
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:53,843
Who was it?

433
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,987
Shit.
How the hell did this happen?

434
00:36:08,891 --> 00:36:12,160
Cernan told me cloud cover
was down to 500 feet.

435
00:36:12,162 --> 00:36:14,161
Probably never
saw the building.

436
00:36:14,163 --> 00:36:16,163
Clearly, the error
was the approach.

437
00:36:16,165 --> 00:36:18,168
He was coming in too slow
to reach the runway.

438
00:36:23,106 --> 00:36:24,708
What?

439
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:28,309
You know Deke had
his doubts about him.

440
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,645
That's why he moved Elliot
off Eight.

441
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,082
Deke gave Elliot
his own command.

442
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:35,917
Elliot wasn't
aggressive enough.

443
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:37,918
You of all people
have to know that.

444
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,088
No, I don't.

445
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,923
I didn't investigate the crash.

446
00:36:42,925 --> 00:36:44,892
I didn't study
the flight trajectory.

447
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:47,228
And I wasn't the one
flying the plane.

448
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,032
So I wouldn't pretend
to know anything.

449
00:36:54,071 --> 00:36:56,839
We'll never be
a hundred percent sure.

450
00:37:44,121 --> 00:37:46,222
Can we go?

451
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,857
Uh... uh, not right now.

452
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,227
I want to help Marilyn
clear all this up.

453
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:54,098
I don't want to have her do it
after we're gone.

454
00:37:59,203 --> 00:38:00,805
Neil?

455
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,446
I'm sorry.

456
00:38:10,448 --> 00:38:12,349
I hate to be a bother.

457
00:38:12,351 --> 00:38:14,416
- Oh, Jan, it's no bother.
- Oh, Jan.

458
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,385
Yeah, no.

459
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:18,357
Neil's, uh...

460
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,295
There was a year
when we were at Edwards...

461
00:38:26,297 --> 00:38:27,932
Four pilots died.

462
00:38:31,903 --> 00:38:33,836
We got good at funerals
that year.

463
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,409
We haven't been to one
in a while.

464
00:38:41,846 --> 00:38:44,148
Does he ever talk to you
about Karen, Ed?

465
00:38:45,783 --> 00:38:48,120
Not really. No.

466
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:53,458
Does he talk to you about her?

467
00:38:54,892 --> 00:38:56,428
No.

468
00:38:58,363 --> 00:39:00,163
Never.

469
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,135
Hey, buddy.

470
00:39:38,537 --> 00:39:40,772
You know,
you should be with Jan.

471
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:44,941
Neil, you should be playing
with your kids.

472
00:39:44,943 --> 00:39:48,045
You know, putting them
into bed.

473
00:39:48,047 --> 00:39:49,913
- Times like these...
- Do you think I'm standing

474
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:51,582
out here in the backyard

475
00:39:51,584 --> 00:39:54,418
'cause I want to talk
to somebody, Ed?

476
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,989
I'm sorry?

477
00:39:58,424 --> 00:40:00,091
Do you think I left there

478
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,362
'cause I want to talk
to somebody?

479
00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:25,148
<i>T-minus one minute</i>

480
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,353
<i>and counting
on the Atlas-Agena launch.</i>

481
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:57,616
Liftoff.

482
00:40:57,618 --> 00:40:59,852
Agena is go.

483
00:41:02,288 --> 00:41:04,155
Flight dynamics for unmanned

484
00:41:04,157 --> 00:41:06,924
Agena target vehicle
looking good.

485
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:09,330
Stand by for Gemini launch.

486
00:41:32,986 --> 00:41:33,987
Yeah.

487
00:41:48,635 --> 00:41:50,669
Okay.

488
00:41:50,671 --> 00:41:52,172
All right.

489
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:57,242
Guaymas,
read you loud and clear.

490
00:41:57,244 --> 00:42:00,513
We have S band track.
We have just locked up on TM.

491
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:01,580
All right. Yeah, what's that?

492
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,215
- What's-what's happening?
- Uh, did you say

493
00:42:03,217 --> 00:42:04,149
- all systems go on TM?
- Yeah, yeah.

494
00:42:04,151 --> 00:42:05,651
Let me see. All right.

495
00:42:05,653 --> 00:42:07,185
All right,
hold still. Hold still.

496
00:42:07,187 --> 00:42:08,420
- What is that?
- Hold on.

497
00:42:08,422 --> 00:42:10,656
Scoot...
Can you scoot down at all?

498
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:12,624
All right.

499
00:42:12,626 --> 00:42:14,025
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

500
00:42:14,027 --> 00:42:15,528
Has anybody got
a Swiss Army knife?

501
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:18,030
- Hold on, hold on a sec.
- What'd you say?

502
00:42:18,032 --> 00:42:20,132
- See if this will do the trick.
- Yeah. - A Swiss Army knife?

503
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:22,135
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

504
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:24,070
- It's just a little...
- Are you kidding me?

505
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:25,638
- There we go.
- You got it. - A little lower.

506
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,474
- Good Lord.
- Guaymas, Agena is go.

507
00:42:28,476 --> 00:42:30,245
Roger, Guaymas.

508
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,687
Switching to HF.

509
00:43:46,689 --> 00:43:48,255
One, two, three, four, five.

510
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:50,390
Five, four, three, two, one.
Check out.

511
00:43:50,392 --> 00:43:52,493
Copy. T-minus two minutes.

512
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:55,496
- Engines to start.
- Ground power removal.

513
00:43:55,498 --> 00:43:56,663
Stage two
prevalves coming open.

514
00:43:56,665 --> 00:43:57,832
Five seconds.

515
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,784
T-minus 20 seconds. Mark.

516
00:44:59,396 --> 00:45:03,164
Ten, nine,

517
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:07,235

518
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,737

521
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,715
Ignition.

522
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,156
Liftoff.

523
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:38,433
Clock is running.
Got a roll program in.

524
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,702
Roger. Roll.

525
00:45:39,704 --> 00:45:41,236
Good liftoff, Eight.

526
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:52,881
- Pitch program.
- Roger. Pitch program.

527
00:46:03,294 --> 00:46:05,461
DCS update received.

528
00:46:05,463 --> 00:46:06,797
Roger. DCS.

529
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:18,240
Stage two tanks look good.

530
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:20,177
That's about
three and a half g's.

531
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:59,816
Go from the ground for staging.

532
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:01,620
Roger.

533
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,668
Fuel cells are solid.

534
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:20,003
Gemini 8. Mark.

535
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:23,741
V over Vr is, uh, .08.

536
00:47:23,743 --> 00:47:25,844
Okay. Mode three.

537
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,853
We had SECO.

538
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:25,836
"...fear that someone
will break in

539
00:48:25,838 --> 00:48:28,073
and steal all of my..."

540
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:29,941
Okay, we're all set.

541
00:48:29,943 --> 00:48:31,876
"...Hank Williams..."

542
00:48:31,878 --> 00:48:33,912
Transmitting maneuver load.

543
00:48:33,914 --> 00:48:36,981
It's a height adjust.

544
00:48:36,983 --> 00:48:40,051
Height adjust. Got DCS.

545
00:48:40,053 --> 00:48:43,454
Roger. And are you ready
to copy the update? Over.

546
00:48:43,456 --> 00:48:45,456
Okay.
Go with the update, Hawaii.

547
00:48:45,458 --> 00:48:50,361
Roger. G.E.T. B-13437.

548
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:53,064
Delta-V, two-decimal-nine.

549
00:48:53,066 --> 00:48:55,599
Burn time,
zero plus zero-five...

550
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:00,805
Hey, Mom, can I get you
anything?

551
00:49:00,807 --> 00:49:01,942
He's doing good.

552
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,544
"Constant."

553
00:49:05,546 --> 00:49:08,113
"How can you do push-ups

554
00:49:08,115 --> 00:49:10,749
when your nose gets
in the way?"

555
00:49:10,751 --> 00:49:12,750
Roger, Hawaii. Got it.

556
00:49:12,752 --> 00:49:13,985
This is Paul Haney

557
00:49:13,987 --> 00:49:15,487
at Gemini Control Houston.

558
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,924
Our display chart
shows Gemini 8 in orbit.

559
00:49:17,926 --> 00:49:19,490
The crew will now attempt

560
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:21,426
to find the unmanned
Agena spacecraft

561
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:23,395
and dock with it.

562
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:43,483
- Burn end.
- Good burn.

563
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:59,634
Shouldn't we have a visual
on the Agena by now?

564
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:06,638
Houston, I think
we overdid it a little.

565
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,706
We should have stopped early.

566
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,008
Uh, roger.

567
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:10,877
Uh, Eight, stand by
for a correction.

568
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,478
So we're getting
the difference.

569
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,646
I'm on that.

570
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:16,048
FIDO, Flight. How we doing?

571
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:18,117
Okay, we got a solid track
on both vehicles.

572
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,684
Calculating for the burn.

573
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:22,488
FIDO, Agena. Do you have
what you need from us?

574
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,824
FIDO, did you copy that?

575
00:50:24,826 --> 00:50:26,959
Roger, Flight. I copy.

576
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:28,728
- You guys getting this?
- We just have some

577
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,464
ratty data
with the Gemini computer.

578
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,700
Need the correction, gentlemen.
Let's go.

579
00:50:34,702 --> 00:50:35,969
- Sending it up now.
- Okay, CAPCOM,

580
00:50:35,971 --> 00:50:37,203
let's get it up to them.

581
00:50:37,205 --> 00:50:38,771
This is Houston CAPCOM.

582
00:50:38,773 --> 00:50:40,908
Uh, we're gonna need you
to do another burn here

583
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,742
very shortly,
so stand by to copy.

584
00:50:42,744 --> 00:50:46,880
Uh, G.E.T. B-030341.

585
00:50:46,882 --> 00:50:50,917
Uh, Delta-V
is two seconds posigrade.

586
00:50:50,919 --> 00:50:52,618
Two feet...

587
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,122
Uh, Delta-V
is two feet posigrade.

588
00:50:56,124 --> 00:50:58,825
Uh, Eight, do you copy?

589
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,964
Mark.

590
00:51:03,966 --> 00:51:05,198
Two feet posigrade...

591
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,699
Give that back, Mark.
Give that back.

592
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:08,634
Put it back on the table.
Give me it.

593
00:51:08,636 --> 00:51:10,604
Honey, give me it.

594
00:51:10,606 --> 00:51:12,204
It's really important.

595
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:14,241
Give that back to Mom
right now.

596
00:51:14,243 --> 00:51:16,243
Do you copy?

597
00:51:16,245 --> 00:51:19,212
Mark Armstrong, if you
don't give me that back...

598
00:51:19,214 --> 00:51:20,781
Eight, do you copy?

599
00:51:20,783 --> 00:51:22,282
I'm not joking, Mark.

600
00:51:22,284 --> 00:51:24,850
I'm getting a horrendous

601
00:51:24,852 --> 00:51:27,521
20 to 25 feet
per second down, Neil.

602
00:51:27,523 --> 00:51:29,856
I can't see any possible
reason for that.

603
00:51:29,858 --> 00:51:31,624
- Where are we on the plot?
- We're above it.

604
00:51:31,626 --> 00:51:32,993
Right, but what does it
look like if...

605
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:34,995
I can't. I'm sorry.
I have to...

606
00:51:34,997 --> 00:51:37,030
- I have to look at this.
- Okay.

607
00:51:37,032 --> 00:51:39,099
Eight, can you give us a status?

608
00:51:39,101 --> 00:51:41,302
No. I got too much to do.

609
00:51:41,304 --> 00:51:43,270
Copy. Standing by.

610
00:51:45,808 --> 00:51:48,241
Okay, we're gonna go
with a closed loop.

611
00:51:48,243 --> 00:51:52,180
25 forward,
eight left, three up,

612
00:51:52,182 --> 00:51:54,249
and I'm going to rate command.

613
00:51:57,786 --> 00:52:01,021
Three, two, one.

614
00:52:01,023 --> 00:52:02,189
Burn.

615
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,266
Could be a planet.

616
00:52:45,268 --> 00:52:47,637
Could be.

617
00:52:51,975 --> 00:52:53,775
This is Houston.

618
00:52:53,777 --> 00:52:56,144
We have your ground TPI backup
when you're ready to copy.

619
00:52:56,146 --> 00:52:57,346
Uh, stand by.

620
00:52:57,348 --> 00:52:59,114
We have a visual on the Agena.

621
00:52:59,116 --> 00:53:02,784
At least something
we think looks like the Agena.

622
00:53:02,786 --> 00:53:05,888
Understand.
Possible visual on the Agena.

623
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:08,290
- We're getting a little out of plane now.
- Uh, yeah.

624
00:53:08,292 --> 00:53:10,859
Uh, we gotta get three aft
and two and a half up.

625
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:12,026
I'm going to start braking.

626
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:13,828
Give me a digital range
and rate.

627
00:53:19,202 --> 00:53:20,701
I better back off a bit.

628
00:53:20,703 --> 00:53:23,072
6,000 feet,
31 feet per second.

629
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,210
Put in a little to the left.

630
00:53:28,212 --> 00:53:30,211
1,680 feet.

631
00:53:36,786 --> 00:53:39,721
That's unbelievable.

632
00:53:39,723 --> 00:53:42,193
Would you look at that?

633
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:53,303
You tell 'em.

634
00:53:57,174 --> 00:53:59,907
Houston, we're
station-keeping on the Agena

635
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:02,411
about 150 feet.

636
00:54:02,413 --> 00:54:04,780
Okay, stay focused, gentlemen.

637
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:07,049
- We're only halfway there.
- Nice job, guys.

638
00:54:07,051 --> 00:54:10,453
- Thanks for the extra hands.
- Let's do this, huh?

639
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:16,061
Stay focused, gentlemen.

640
00:54:37,282 --> 00:54:39,282
Man, it flies easy.

641
00:54:39,284 --> 00:54:41,050
Does it really?

642
00:54:41,052 --> 00:54:43,819
The station-keeping,
it's just...

643
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:45,924
it's like nothing.

644
00:54:54,865 --> 00:54:57,500
Uh, RKV, this is Eight.

645
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,902
We're sitting
about two feet out.

646
00:54:59,904 --> 00:55:01,204
Uh, roger.

647
00:55:01,206 --> 00:55:03,273
Uh, stand by for a couple
of minutes here.

648
00:55:03,275 --> 00:55:05,108
Roger.

649
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,843
Okay, Gemini 8,

650
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,311
uh, we have TM solid.

651
00:55:08,313 --> 00:55:09,812
You're looking good
on the ground.

652
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:11,915
Go ahead and dock.

653
00:55:28,334 --> 00:55:31,836
Okay. We're gonna cycle
our Rigid-Stop switch now.

654
00:55:56,462 --> 00:55:58,329
Flight, we are docked.

655
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:10,841
Someone call Cronkite!

656
00:56:10,843 --> 00:56:13,844
Have him tell the Soviets
that they can go screw!

657
00:56:13,846 --> 00:56:16,080
Get him on the phone, man.

658
00:56:16,082 --> 00:56:17,449
Hey, Pete!
Hey, call those idiots

659
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:19,049
at Congress while you're at it.

660
00:56:19,051 --> 00:56:22,052
- Yeah, I'll start with Rhode Island.
- Huh?

661
00:56:22,054 --> 00:56:24,989
Oh, damn.

662
00:56:24,991 --> 00:56:26,491
Well done.
Let's go ahead and get

663
00:56:26,493 --> 00:56:28,493
a state vector
on the combined spacecraft.

664
00:56:28,495 --> 00:56:30,828
Gemini 8,
this is Houston CAPCOM.

665
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:31,962
Please stand by to copy.

666
00:56:31,964 --> 00:56:33,030
Check out my room like this.

667
00:56:33,032 --> 00:56:35,000
- But I don't think...
- Look at all these papers.

668
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:36,200
I know.

669
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:38,470
I spent days
trying to work on that,

670
00:56:38,472 --> 00:56:40,438
and now it's crumpled up.

671
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,973
- Look at my drawer!
- I know.

672
00:56:42,975 --> 00:56:44,542
I had all my crayons in that,

673
00:56:44,544 --> 00:56:46,578
and now look
at all the crayons.

674
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,379
But, Ricky, are you telling me
the full story?

675
00:56:48,381 --> 00:56:50,215
'Cause I'm not sure your
brother would do that unless...

676
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:51,950
Yes, I am telling you!
Look at this!

677
00:56:51,952 --> 00:56:53,619
Now, don't you get angry
with me.

678
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:55,287
Don't get upset.

679
00:56:55,289 --> 00:56:56,955
Uh, Eight, this is Houston.

680
00:56:56,957 --> 00:56:58,990
Uh, I've got a nodal update
for you. Stand by.

681
00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:00,858
Anybody try calling
about the appointment?

682
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,894
Okay, go ahead.

683
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:04,296
- Rick!
- Roger.

684
00:57:04,298 --> 00:57:06,431
Node 070447...

685
00:57:06,433 --> 00:57:08,533
Okay. Out here now.

686
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:10,101
Out here now.

687
00:57:10,103 --> 00:57:11,902
Against 51552 right ascension.

688
00:57:11,904 --> 00:57:14,205
Gemini 8, we're
about to have a loss of signal.

689
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:16,041
- Where have you gone?
- We'll pick you up

690
00:57:16,043 --> 00:57:17,975
over the hill for Dave's E.V.A.

691
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:29,322
Well, that's peculiar.

692
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:31,356
Oh, good.

693
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:34,059
I'm hoping
that's just excess hydrogen.

694
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:36,027
I think I'm gonna
save mine for later.

695
00:57:37,264 --> 00:57:38,464
Little treat.

696
00:57:43,470 --> 00:57:45,340
Uh, Neil, we're in a bank.

697
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,313
We're not doing it.
It's-it's not us. It must be...

698
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:57,583
Shut off the Agena's
control systems.

699
00:57:57,585 --> 00:58:01,188
Code 400,
Agena control system shutdown.

700
00:58:25,146 --> 00:58:27,113
Cycle the Agena.

701
00:58:27,115 --> 00:58:28,247
Turning it on.

702
00:58:28,249 --> 00:58:30,182
Turning it off.

703
00:58:55,009 --> 00:58:56,710
I'm gonna cycle the ACME

704
00:58:56,712 --> 00:58:59,179
and the propellant
motor valves.

705
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:01,313
Switching ADL to pitch.

706
00:59:01,315 --> 00:59:03,285
RL to pitch.

707
00:59:09,658 --> 00:59:11,093
Roll meter 200 and rising.

708
00:59:14,997 --> 00:59:16,062
Separate from the Agena.

709
00:59:18,266 --> 00:59:21,101
Setting Agena
to allow remote command.

710
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:22,603
Switching on the DAC.

711
00:59:22,605 --> 00:59:24,136
Make sure you give it
extra thrust

712
00:59:24,138 --> 00:59:25,472
so we don't smash
into the Agena.

713
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:27,007
On my mark, undock.

714
00:59:29,211 --> 00:59:32,112
Two. One.

715
00:59:47,363 --> 00:59:49,797
OAMS propellant, 13%.

716
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:51,766
It's not the Agena. It's us.

717
01:00:14,223 --> 01:00:18,759
Gemini 8, coming back
into range in three, two, one.

718
01:00:18,761 --> 01:00:21,095
This is CSQ,
checking our comm link.

719
01:00:21,097 --> 01:00:22,697
How do you read?

720
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:27,101
Gemini 8, how do you read?

721
01:00:27,103 --> 01:00:29,070
We have serious problems.

722
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:31,205
We're tumbling
end over end up here.

723
01:00:31,207 --> 01:00:32,807
We're disengaged
from the Agena.

724
01:00:32,809 --> 01:00:35,243
Okay, we got your spacecraft

725
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,378
free indication here.

726
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:39,447
What seems to be the problem?

727
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:42,283
We're rolling up,
and we can't turn anything off.

728
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:44,085
We're continuously increasing
in a left roll.

729
01:00:44,087 --> 01:00:45,419
CSQ, Flight.

730
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:46,755
Go ahead, Flight.

731
01:00:46,757 --> 01:00:49,657
Did he say he cannot turn
the Agena off?

732
01:00:49,659 --> 01:00:52,494
Uh, no, he says
he's separated from the Agena

733
01:00:52,496 --> 01:00:55,596
and he's in a roll
and he can't stop it.

734
01:00:55,598 --> 01:00:58,333
Flight, their roll meter
reads 270 and rising.

735
01:00:58,335 --> 01:00:59,767
At that rate,
they'll be passing out

736
01:00:59,769 --> 01:01:01,604
in about 40 seconds.

737
01:01:02,706 --> 01:01:03,774
Paul.

738
01:01:04,875 --> 01:01:06,709
Paul.

739
01:01:08,546 --> 01:01:10,712
Trying to stop the rates.

740
01:01:10,714 --> 01:01:12,750
We certainly have...

741
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:04,369
We can't...

742
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:28,691
Close the RCS breakers.

743
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:34,697
- Dave!
- Gemini 8, did you say

744
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:37,734
you are closing RCS breakers?

745
01:02:37,736 --> 01:02:41,738
Are you initiating RCS?

746
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:46,844
Gemini 8, again, did you say
you are closing RCS breakers?

747
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:49,946
You will not be able
to control your attitude.

748
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:17,907
Okay.

749
01:03:17,909 --> 01:03:20,343
We're regaining control
of the spacecraft.

750
01:03:20,345 --> 01:03:22,312
Slowly in RCS direct.

751
01:03:24,016 --> 01:03:26,282
Roger.

752
01:03:26,284 --> 01:03:27,751
Roger. Copy.

753
01:03:27,753 --> 01:03:29,253
We're pulsing the RCS slowly.

754
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:30,586
It's all roll right.

755
01:03:30,588 --> 01:03:33,390
We're trying to kill
our roll rate here.

756
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:44,635
Move us back to one ring.

757
01:03:44,637 --> 01:03:45,669
Copy.

758
01:03:55,948 --> 01:03:57,715
<i>I want
emergency landing options.</i>

759
01:03:57,717 --> 01:04:00,318
Wait until you find out
how much fuel they have left.

760
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,388
Bob, what do you think?

761
01:04:04,390 --> 01:04:06,392
I think they'd better land now.

762
01:04:10,697 --> 01:04:13,766
Deke, Jan's outside.

763
01:04:29,582 --> 01:04:31,750
Jan, the ship is stable.
They're gonna be all right.

764
01:04:31,752 --> 01:04:33,618
He's okay, Jan.

765
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:35,019
I need you to go home.

766
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:36,687
Fine. Turn the box back on.

767
01:04:36,689 --> 01:04:38,089
- I'll see what I can do...
- Now.

768
01:04:38,091 --> 01:04:41,658
Turn the box back on now.

769
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:42,994
Well, there's
security protocol in place.

770
01:04:42,996 --> 01:04:44,562
Well, I don't give a damn.

771
01:04:44,564 --> 01:04:46,464
I've got a dozen cameras
on my front lawn, Deke.

772
01:04:46,466 --> 01:04:47,999
Do you want me telling them
what's going on?

773
01:04:48,001 --> 01:04:49,901
Jan, you have to trust us.

774
01:04:49,903 --> 01:04:51,469
We've got this under control.

775
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,370
- No, you don't.
- We've...

776
01:04:53,372 --> 01:04:54,806
All these protocols
and procedures

777
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,542
to make it seem like
you have it under control.

778
01:04:57,544 --> 01:04:59,610
But you're a bunch of boys

779
01:04:59,612 --> 01:05:01,446
making models
out of balsa wood.

780
01:05:01,448 --> 01:05:03,648
You don't have anything
under control.

781
01:05:08,522 --> 01:05:10,388
Naha Rescue One will be

782
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:14,526
on station at splashdown
with a flotation collar.

783
01:05:14,528 --> 01:05:16,896
Did you get the call signs?

784
01:05:16,898 --> 01:05:18,429
Uh, yeah.

785
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:20,767
It's Naha Rescue One,
Naha Search One.

786
01:05:23,004 --> 01:05:24,903
Well, I'd like to argue
with them

787
01:05:24,905 --> 01:05:27,706
about the going home,
but I'm...

788
01:05:27,708 --> 01:05:29,676
not sure how we can.

789
01:05:31,378 --> 01:05:33,511
Yeah.

790
01:05:33,513 --> 01:05:38,653
I just keep thinking, is there
anything else that we forgot?

791
01:05:40,021 --> 01:05:42,389
We did everything,
as far as I know.

792
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,404
<i>Gemini 8 saw
two complex vehicles</i>

793
01:05:58,406 --> 01:06:00,639
<i>launched on the same day
on time.</i>

794
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:04,110
We saw flawless rendezvous
and docking.

795
01:06:04,112 --> 01:06:06,912
All of which is tended
to be overshadowed

796
01:06:06,914 --> 01:06:09,882
by the malfunction, but, uh,

797
01:06:09,884 --> 01:06:12,117
I think we should focus
on the progress

798
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:14,019
resulting from the mission.

799
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:16,455
The board would like to focus

800
01:06:16,457 --> 01:06:17,790
on the malfunction.

801
01:06:17,792 --> 01:06:19,859
Neil, walk us through
the decision

802
01:06:19,861 --> 01:06:22,494
to separate from the Agena.

803
01:06:24,498 --> 01:06:26,632
You mentioned
that the rate of revolution

804
01:06:26,634 --> 01:06:28,500
was more than once a second.

805
01:06:28,502 --> 01:06:30,436
How near were you
to being unconscious?

806
01:06:30,438 --> 01:06:32,138
Did you think to use the Agena

807
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,439
to stabilize
the combined craft?

808
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:34,808
We did.

809
01:06:34,810 --> 01:06:37,810
This was, uh, not successful.

810
01:06:37,812 --> 01:06:40,046
As I said, we initially assumed

811
01:06:40,048 --> 01:06:42,648
that the anomaly was with
the Agena control system.

812
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:44,516
'Cause there was no way to know
that a thruster

813
01:06:44,518 --> 01:06:46,152
was causing the...

814
01:06:46,154 --> 01:06:51,124
If we could have, uh, isolated
each of Gemini's thrusters,

815
01:06:51,126 --> 01:06:53,692
if we'd had that capability
in the moment...

816
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:57,931
Agence France. Did you have
any feeling of anxiety

817
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:00,499
after the failure
of the thrusters?

818
01:07:00,501 --> 01:07:02,569
In the midst of the spinning,
did you seem to realize

819
01:07:02,571 --> 01:07:06,006
or feel the presence of God
closer than other times?

820
01:07:06,008 --> 01:07:08,041
With this so hot
on the heels of the loss

821
01:07:08,043 --> 01:07:09,743
of Charlie Bassett
and Elliot See,

822
01:07:09,745 --> 01:07:11,878
do you question whether
the program's worth the cost?

823
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,048
In money and in lives?

824
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:27,228
All right, thanks, guys.

825
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:28,996
We've got a lot to discuss,
and we'll be

826
01:07:28,998 --> 01:07:30,163
back in touch with you soon.

827
01:07:30,165 --> 01:07:31,898
Thank you.

828
01:07:33,568 --> 01:07:35,201
Mm-mm.

829
01:07:35,203 --> 01:07:37,938
No, so we're using
our thumb now, honey.

830
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:39,040
- Oh.
- Okay.

831
01:07:43,279 --> 01:07:45,046
"Our Wild Ride in Space"?

832
01:07:45,048 --> 01:07:46,914
It's marketing, Mr. Armstrong.

833
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:48,882
NASA approval numbers
are dropping.

834
01:07:48,884 --> 01:07:50,650
- We need to...
- Well, that's not my concern.

835
01:07:50,652 --> 01:07:52,586
Almost.
Okay, I'm gonna finish, uh,

836
01:07:52,588 --> 01:07:54,188
wrapping your brother's
present. I'll be back.

837
01:07:54,190 --> 01:07:56,589
- You practice that one.
- I'll try.

838
01:07:58,027 --> 01:07:59,526
I'm not interested in how

839
01:07:59,528 --> 01:08:01,530
other magazines
are framing the story.

840
01:08:15,144 --> 01:08:17,213
Okay. Keep going.

841
01:08:18,915 --> 01:08:20,781
<i>If it's any consolation,</i>

842
01:08:20,783 --> 01:08:23,017
<i>Ed was a zombie for weeks
after Gemini 4.</i>

843
01:08:23,019 --> 01:08:24,584
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

844
01:08:25,888 --> 01:08:27,621
Yeah.

845
01:08:27,623 --> 01:08:31,659
I guess it must be, uh,
disorienting for them.

846
01:08:31,661 --> 01:08:34,062
Certainly.

847
01:08:34,064 --> 01:08:36,132
Yeah.

848
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:40,102
God, Pat.

849
01:08:40,104 --> 01:08:44,239
I married Neil
'cause I wanted a normal life.

850
01:08:45,641 --> 01:08:47,844
I know. I know.

851
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:52,647
He was just so different from
all the other boys on campus.

852
01:08:52,649 --> 01:08:53,583
Mmm.

853
01:08:54,917 --> 01:08:57,919
He'd been through the war.
You know.

854
01:08:57,921 --> 01:09:00,721
He knew what he wanted to do.

855
01:09:00,723 --> 01:09:02,826
He just seemed so stable.

856
01:09:05,028 --> 01:09:07,630
I guess all I wanted
was stability.

857
01:09:13,636 --> 01:09:16,671
I've got a sorority sister
with a normal life.

858
01:09:16,673 --> 01:09:19,341
- Yeah?
- She married a dentist.

859
01:09:19,343 --> 01:09:20,842
Dentist.

860
01:09:20,844 --> 01:09:22,378
Sounds good.

861
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,714
He's home by 6:00 every night,
and every few months,

862
01:09:25,716 --> 01:09:27,818
she calls to say
she wishes he weren't.

863
01:09:35,893 --> 01:09:37,728
Yeah.

864
01:09:42,666 --> 01:09:44,300
Still working, I see.

865
01:09:44,302 --> 01:09:45,902
Yeah.

866
01:09:45,904 --> 01:09:48,870
Well, I was, uh,

867
01:09:48,872 --> 01:09:51,309
gonna go grab a beer at Dave's.

868
01:09:57,082 --> 01:09:58,748
Yeah, all right. Fine.

869
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,984
I could use a beer.

870
01:10:04,988 --> 01:10:08,657
♪ Sure, so sure, so sure...

871
01:10:08,659 --> 01:10:11,360
You know, I will say one thing.

872
01:10:11,362 --> 01:10:15,431
It's all I can think about,
is getting back up there.

873
01:10:15,433 --> 01:10:17,732
Just caught a rough break.

874
01:10:17,734 --> 01:10:19,902
Well, you boys
did everything right.

875
01:10:19,904 --> 01:10:22,839
Everything. You know, I was
talking about it with Gus,

876
01:10:22,841 --> 01:10:23,872
and we both agreed.

877
01:10:23,874 --> 01:10:25,074
I did hear a little rumor

878
01:10:25,076 --> 01:10:27,110
that you and Gus
have been hanging out.

879
01:10:27,112 --> 01:10:28,144
You did?

880
01:10:28,146 --> 01:10:29,178
Mm-hmm.

881
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,246
Hey.

882
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:32,682
Is it true?

883
01:10:32,684 --> 01:10:34,719
Is what true?

884
01:10:38,022 --> 01:10:39,689
Deke pulled me aside
and told me

885
01:10:39,691 --> 01:10:41,392
that him and Gus want me
on the crew.

886
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:45,061
Of the first Apollo?

887
01:10:45,063 --> 01:10:46,896
Yeah.

888
01:10:46,898 --> 01:10:49,098
Yeah. Holy shit.

889
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:50,233
That's huge.

890
01:10:50,235 --> 01:10:52,702
Congratulations.

891
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:54,704
I gotta shake your hand.

892
01:10:54,706 --> 01:10:56,373
- Thanks, man.
- Wow.

893
01:10:56,375 --> 01:10:57,975
That Saturn's a monster.

894
01:10:57,977 --> 01:10:59,742
You're in for one heck
of a ride.

895
01:10:59,744 --> 01:11:01,978
- It is.
- Oh, hey, uh, uh,

896
01:11:01,980 --> 01:11:03,347
you know Deke wants Gus to be

897
01:11:03,349 --> 01:11:05,047
the first one
on the Moon, so...

898
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:08,085
Hey, that puts you in the LEM
with him for the landing.

899
01:11:08,087 --> 01:11:09,853
- Oh, no, no, no, let's not...
- Ed.

900
01:11:09,855 --> 01:11:11,354
- Let's not get carried away.
- All right.

901
01:11:11,356 --> 01:11:13,423
Get out of my house.
I gotta go to bed.

902
01:11:13,425 --> 01:11:17,059
I'm not kidding. Get out of my house.

903
01:11:18,163 --> 01:11:19,298
Neil.

904
01:11:21,267 --> 01:11:22,799
Hey, Neil.
Don't bother sitting.

905
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:24,268
It's going to be
a short meeting.

906
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,403
We've talked it through.
We think it's pretty clear.

907
01:11:26,405 --> 01:11:28,838
If you hadn't kept cool,
you wouldn't be here,

908
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:30,806
and we'd still be asking
what the hell happened.

909
01:11:30,808 --> 01:11:32,876
So would Congress.
It's a showstopper.

910
01:11:32,878 --> 01:11:34,244
This mission was a success.

911
01:11:34,246 --> 01:11:36,113
We're full steam ahead
for Apollo.

912
01:11:36,115 --> 01:11:37,881
You good with that?

913
01:11:37,883 --> 01:11:39,983
- Yes, sir.
- I trust you won't mind

914
01:11:39,985 --> 01:11:41,853
representing us
at the White House.

915
01:11:44,423 --> 01:11:47,024
- No, sir.
- Good.

916
01:11:47,026 --> 01:11:49,128
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

917
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:52,130
Thank you.

918
01:11:52,132 --> 01:11:54,264
"Interface problems and develop

919
01:11:54,266 --> 01:11:56,900
operational techniques
for the most efficient use of,"

920
01:11:56,902 --> 01:12:00,170
uh, "onboard capabilities."

921
01:12:00,172 --> 01:12:02,072
What?

922
01:12:04,244 --> 01:12:06,310
No, it's not...

923
01:12:06,312 --> 01:12:08,346
I got one.

924
01:12:08,348 --> 01:12:10,248
- I got one.
- No! No!

925
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:11,782
I got one.

926
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:12,684
I don't know
why you're laughing.

927
01:12:12,686 --> 01:12:13,750
He's gonna do that to you
in a minute.

928
01:12:13,752 --> 01:12:16,454
This time, I'm gonna
put this one in the freezer.

929
01:12:16,456 --> 01:12:18,088
- You need a hand?
- Yeah.

930
01:12:18,090 --> 01:12:19,990
- Okay, in you go.
- Can you open the freezer?

931
01:12:19,992 --> 01:12:21,359
Let's keep him for longer,

932
01:12:21,361 --> 01:12:23,428
and then he won't let...
In you go. In you go.

933
01:12:34,241 --> 01:12:37,408
I got one. I got one.

934
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:38,509
Because I want to.

935
01:12:38,511 --> 01:12:40,044
Who did... who did what?

936
01:12:40,046 --> 01:12:41,979
- Me.
- Have you seen his room?

937
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:43,917
Son, go stand in the corner.

938
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:50,488
It's not funny.

939
01:12:53,093 --> 01:12:54,959
Thanks a lot, Mark!

940
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:57,061
- Stop laughing.
- You're lying!

941
01:12:57,063 --> 01:12:58,330
Just, you stop it.

942
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,231
You're the reason he's upset.

943
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:01,966
- Your mother's not laughing.
- I'm not laughing.

944
01:13:01,968 --> 01:13:03,101
- I'm... crying.
- She's crying.

945
01:13:03,103 --> 01:13:04,238
It's not yours!

946
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,209
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

947
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:12,076
<i>Eddie's started
asking questions</i>

948
01:13:12,078 --> 01:13:14,513
- <i>about the new command module.</i>
- <i>Is that right?</i>

949
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,081
<i>Yeah, he wants to...
wants to know if it's gonna</i>

950
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:18,950
fly any different to Gemini.

951
01:13:18,952 --> 01:13:21,420
If the little buttons
are gonna be in the same place.

952
01:13:22,889 --> 01:13:24,490
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah.

953
01:13:24,492 --> 01:13:27,393
You got yourself
a little engineer there.

954
01:13:27,395 --> 01:13:31,332
I tell you, though,
I love that he's interested.

955
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:36,502
Came in the other morning,
he did.

956
01:13:36,504 --> 01:13:39,538
Comes running up,
and he says, "Daddy,

957
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,042
"if you go to the Moon, are you
gonna be lonely out there?

958
01:13:43,044 --> 01:13:45,379
So far away from the Earth."

959
01:13:48,115 --> 01:13:50,084
"All of us back here at home."

960
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:55,556
This-this whole thing
is expanding his horizons.

961
01:13:57,426 --> 01:13:59,859
It, uh, gives me faith.

962
01:14:01,262 --> 01:14:03,230
It make sense?

963
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:09,970
Walkers got a new swing set.

964
01:14:11,505 --> 01:14:13,441
Yeah, I noticed that.

965
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:27,589
We had a swing like that
back up in Juniper Hills.

966
01:14:32,126 --> 01:14:34,929
Karen really loved it.

967
01:14:37,532 --> 01:14:39,334
That's your daughter?

968
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:51,010
Guess I ought to be
getting home.

969
01:15:41,597 --> 01:15:43,231
Closing hatches now.

970
01:15:50,473 --> 01:15:51,672
Okay, that's all of 'em.

971
01:15:51,674 --> 01:15:53,008
Thanks, Ed.

972
01:15:55,278 --> 01:15:57,511
Ablative hatch closed.

973
01:15:57,513 --> 01:16:00,416
Closing the boost
protective cover.

974
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:02,585
And plugs out.

975
01:16:04,086 --> 01:16:06,087
- Confirm boost hatch sealed.
- Okay.

976
01:16:13,729 --> 01:16:15,464
Ready for oxygen purge.

977
01:16:17,132 --> 01:16:18,499
Okay, we're going to pick up,

978
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,067
but we'll stay
in this configuration

979
01:16:20,069 --> 01:16:22,603
that we're involved
for the rest of the run.

980
01:16:22,605 --> 01:16:24,371
Roger that.

981
01:16:24,373 --> 01:16:26,708
Okay, tell everybody
to be aware that, uh...

982
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:28,443
Uh, you want to hold down
the chatter?

983
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:30,211
We're on open mic.

984
01:16:30,213 --> 01:16:32,114
Uh, let's hold the countdown.

985
01:16:36,185 --> 01:16:37,719
Sorry, guys.
We'll get this squared.

986
01:16:37,721 --> 01:16:40,222
Shit, we're gonna
be here all night.

987
01:16:40,224 --> 01:16:41,522
Gus, we didn't get that.

988
01:16:41,524 --> 01:16:42,824
Course you didn't.

989
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:47,664
Glad you think this is funny.

990
01:16:55,238 --> 01:16:56,738
We finished strong with Gemini,

991
01:16:56,740 --> 01:16:58,807
and we're very, very bullish
on Apollo, Senator.

992
01:16:58,809 --> 01:17:01,810
I should hope so, given the
time we've spent developing it.

993
01:17:01,812 --> 01:17:04,412
Half the country doesn't think
it's worth it anymore.

994
01:17:04,414 --> 01:17:07,115
Uh, well...

995
01:17:07,117 --> 01:17:10,452
we... we learned to fly
only 60 years ago,

996
01:17:10,454 --> 01:17:14,389
so if you consider
the technological developments

997
01:17:14,391 --> 01:17:16,191
in the context of history,
it's really not...

998
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:18,560
I'm considering it in the
context of taxpayer dollars.

999
01:17:18,562 --> 01:17:20,830
And so are we, Senator.

1000
01:17:20,832 --> 01:17:23,097
Between us,
we're doing some final tests

1001
01:17:23,099 --> 01:17:24,766
on the new
command module today.

1002
01:17:24,768 --> 01:17:27,369
I'm sure Mr. Gilruth will be
happy to tell you about it.

1003
01:17:27,371 --> 01:17:29,237
Let me introduce you to Bob.
Come on.

1004
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:30,507
Okay.

1005
01:17:34,578 --> 01:17:36,645
I'd like a photo, sir.

1006
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:39,216
How about you boys?

1007
01:17:50,528 --> 01:17:52,661
Well, I haven't talked yet.
How's this?

1008
01:17:52,663 --> 01:17:55,230
One, two, three, four, five,

1009
01:17:55,232 --> 01:17:57,767
four, three, two, one?

1010
01:18:04,375 --> 01:18:06,141
Uh, we need another minute

1011
01:18:06,143 --> 01:18:07,376
to get it sorted.

1012
01:18:07,378 --> 01:18:09,278
How are we gonna
get to the Moon

1013
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:11,581
if we can't talk
between three buildings?

1014
01:18:11,583 --> 01:18:13,818
They can't hear a thing
you're saying.

1015
01:18:15,253 --> 01:18:16,619
Jesus Christ.

1016
01:18:16,621 --> 01:18:18,219
Say again?

1017
01:18:18,221 --> 01:18:19,789
I said, how are we gonna
get to the Moon

1018
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,524
if we can't talk between two
or three buildings?

1019
01:18:23,628 --> 01:18:25,628
You tell 'em, Gus.
You tell 'em.

1020
01:18:25,630 --> 01:18:26,830
Mickey Mouse shit.

1021
01:18:26,832 --> 01:18:29,465
I got a surge
in the AC bus two voltage.

1022
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:30,833
Try resetting the meter.

1023
01:18:30,835 --> 01:18:33,202
You getting this, Gus?

1024
01:18:33,204 --> 01:18:35,170
Rog.

1025
01:18:35,172 --> 01:18:37,406
You picking anything up
on the dials?

1026
01:18:46,851 --> 01:18:48,885
Hey, we got a fire
in the cockpit.

1027
01:18:54,793 --> 01:18:57,329
Hey, we got a bad fire!

1028
01:19:01,299 --> 01:19:02,768
We're burning up in here!

1029
01:19:13,277 --> 01:19:14,945
Mr. Armstrong?

1030
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:16,913
I have Deke Slayton
on the phone for you.

1031
01:19:16,915 --> 01:19:18,482
Oh.

1032
01:19:18,484 --> 01:19:19,918
Right this way.

1033
01:19:27,761 --> 01:19:29,325
Thank you.

1034
01:19:29,327 --> 01:19:31,328
Well, I'm glad you called.

1035
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:33,698
I'm not sure if I'm helping
or hurting over here.

1036
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,999
Neil, we had a problem
with the plugs-out test.

1037
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:38,736
Well, that's why
we have tests, right?

1038
01:19:38,738 --> 01:19:40,604
We'll figure it out.

1039
01:19:40,606 --> 01:19:42,441
There was a fire.

1040
01:19:43,943 --> 01:19:46,977
God, there's no easy way
to say this.

1041
01:19:46,979 --> 01:19:49,981
Ed, Gus and Roger...

1042
01:19:49,983 --> 01:19:51,918
they're gone.

1043
01:19:55,989 --> 01:19:57,789
We think it was a wiring issue.

1044
01:19:57,791 --> 01:19:59,756
A spark in all that oxygen.

1045
01:19:59,758 --> 01:20:01,793
It happened very quickly.

1046
01:20:01,795 --> 01:20:04,795
Now, listen, we need you guys
to head back to the hotel.

1047
01:20:04,797 --> 01:20:06,563
The press is gonna be
all over this.

1048
01:20:06,565 --> 01:20:09,600
Congress is gonna be calling
for investigations. We...

1049
01:20:09,602 --> 01:20:14,338
We just don't want you guys
in the middle of all that.

1050
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,209
Do you understand?

1051
01:20:17,977 --> 01:20:19,646
Yeah.

1052
01:20:21,748 --> 01:20:23,482
All right, then.

1053
01:20:25,885 --> 01:20:27,554
Okay.

1054
01:20:59,486 --> 01:21:01,019
<i>A lot of people forget about</i>

1055
01:21:01,021 --> 01:21:02,320
<i>the influence
that the lunar program has</i>

1056
01:21:02,322 --> 01:21:04,956
<i>on the raising of our
young people in the country.</i>

1057
01:21:04,958 --> 01:21:07,358
I think that if a civilization
doesn't look out,

1058
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,028
if it doesn't try
to expand its horizons,

1059
01:21:10,030 --> 01:21:14,566
then we're not going
to progress as a nation.

1060
01:21:14,568 --> 01:21:17,002
At 10:30 tonight Eastern Time,

1061
01:21:17,004 --> 01:21:19,403
rescue teams began
to remove the bodies

1062
01:21:19,405 --> 01:21:22,673
of the three astronauts
from the charred spacecraft.

1063
01:21:22,675 --> 01:21:24,977
A NASA spokesman
said the dead astronauts

1064
01:21:24,979 --> 01:21:27,479
were left in the ship
for four hours

1065
01:21:27,481 --> 01:21:30,783
to aid the investigation
into the tragedy.

1066
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:33,819
And according to the
latest information from NASA

1067
01:21:33,821 --> 01:21:35,687
at the Manned Spacecraft Center
in Houston,

1068
01:21:35,689 --> 01:21:37,356
the first Apollo flight,

1069
01:21:37,358 --> 01:21:41,026
which was scheduled for
February the 21st, is now...

1070
01:21:51,438 --> 01:21:53,138
Winds are pretty rough today.

1071
01:21:53,140 --> 01:21:54,740
Keep an eye on your yaw.

1072
01:21:54,742 --> 01:21:56,978
Copy. Correcting.

1073
01:22:05,886 --> 01:22:09,825
1,000 feet.
Switching to lunar mode.

1074
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:14,729
Final landing approach.

1075
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:19,701
You're too low. Climb.

1076
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:24,469
Control is degrading.

1077
01:22:24,471 --> 01:22:26,606
Slow your rates.

1078
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,043
Do you read?

1079
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,444
Neil?

1080
01:23:33,943 --> 01:23:36,176
<i>The vehicle's not safe.</i>

1081
01:23:36,178 --> 01:23:37,912
Well, unfortunately, it's
the best simulation we have.

1082
01:23:37,914 --> 01:23:39,647
And you and the others
are too valuable.

1083
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:41,181
It's a fly-by-wire system
that's got no backup.

1084
01:23:41,183 --> 01:23:42,716
The ejection seat
is the backup.

1085
01:23:42,718 --> 01:23:44,184
Political fallout
from another accident

1086
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:45,920
- will compromise our...
- With all due respect, sir,

1087
01:23:45,922 --> 01:23:47,888
it's not my job to worry
about the political fallout.

1088
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,223
The damn thing
could have killed you.

1089
01:23:49,225 --> 01:23:50,991
- Well, it didn't.
- A split second more,

1090
01:23:50,993 --> 01:23:53,027
- and you would not be...
- Well, we need to fail.

1091
01:23:53,029 --> 01:23:55,629
We need to fail down here
so we don't fail up there.

1092
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:57,498
Okay, Neil, Neil.

1093
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:00,100
At what cost, huh?

1094
01:24:00,102 --> 01:24:02,270
"At what cost?"

1095
01:24:02,272 --> 01:24:05,606
Well, it's a little bit late

1096
01:24:05,608 --> 01:24:08,010
for that question,
isn't it, sir?

1097
01:24:15,518 --> 01:24:16,917
They raise
their voices, their placards,

1098
01:24:16,919 --> 01:24:18,686
and they march
against the government.

1099
01:24:18,688 --> 01:24:21,589
But some go farther,
burning Selective Service cards

1100
01:24:21,591 --> 01:24:23,090
and obstructing the draft.

1101
01:24:23,092 --> 01:24:24,892
Most dissenters
confine themselves

1102
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:27,062
to this kind
of protest activity.

1103
01:24:27,064 --> 01:24:28,629
Hey, hey! LBJ!

1104
01:24:28,631 --> 01:24:30,198
How many kids
did you kill today?

1105
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,767
Hey, hey! LBJ!

1106
01:24:32,769 --> 01:24:34,937
How many kids
did you kill today?

1107
01:24:38,976 --> 01:24:40,643
Pat?

1108
01:24:54,324 --> 01:24:56,159
Pat.

1109
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,227
You okay?

1110
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:00,931
Yes.

1111
01:25:18,882 --> 01:25:20,284
Why don't we go inside?

1112
01:25:47,844 --> 01:25:49,546
Hi.

1113
01:25:54,318 --> 01:25:56,185
Are you okay? Jesus.

1114
01:25:56,187 --> 01:25:57,853
Oh, I'm fine.

1115
01:25:57,855 --> 01:25:59,891
- Look at your face.
- Excuse me.

1116
01:26:04,195 --> 01:26:05,660
Dad, want to come play?

1117
01:26:05,662 --> 01:26:07,163
- Ricky.
- Uh...

1118
01:26:07,165 --> 01:26:09,332
Boys, go on. Go on.

1119
01:26:09,334 --> 01:26:11,834
I know, I know, I know.
Dad's fine.

1120
01:26:11,836 --> 01:26:13,169
Go on. Go back out.

1121
01:26:13,171 --> 01:26:15,172
Go back, go back.

1122
01:26:15,174 --> 01:26:18,274
Mark, not here.

1123
01:26:18,276 --> 01:26:20,876
What happened?

1124
01:26:20,878 --> 01:26:22,213
Um...

1125
01:26:25,384 --> 01:26:26,917
- I, uh...
- Jesus.

1126
01:26:26,919 --> 01:26:29,885
I just remembered I left
something at the office.

1127
01:26:44,036 --> 01:26:45,836
<i>You've lately taken</i>

1128
01:26:45,838 --> 01:26:48,105
<i>a couple of swipes
at the space program.</i>

1129
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:50,874
I think it would be interesting
to, uh, talk more

1130
01:26:50,876 --> 01:26:52,342
about whether this
is the proper thing

1131
01:26:52,344 --> 01:26:54,077
to do with public treasury.

1132
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:55,879
Is the sort of dreams
I would have,

1133
01:26:55,881 --> 01:26:57,947
would be a habitable
New York City, for instance.

1134
01:26:57,949 --> 01:26:59,849
It would seem to me
that that would be

1135
01:26:59,851 --> 01:27:01,318
a reasonable thing to do.

1136
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,786
<i>Wh-What has been the reaction</i>

1137
01:27:02,788 --> 01:27:04,086
<i>of your friends in this?</i>

1138
01:27:04,088 --> 01:27:06,123
<i>Well, they mostly think
that it's ridiculous</i>

1139
01:27:06,125 --> 01:27:08,024
that we're spending
so much money

1140
01:27:08,026 --> 01:27:10,227
to go somewhere where
we don't know anything about.

1141
01:27:10,229 --> 01:27:12,162
And that the money
could be used

1142
01:27:12,164 --> 01:27:13,964
for a lot more helpful things.

1143
01:27:15,867 --> 01:27:19,302
Power!

1144
01:27:19,304 --> 01:27:21,738
- Yeah!
- Power to the people!

- It's a political rush job.

1162
01:28:04,183 --> 01:28:06,317
Congress wouldn't fund us
to come in second.

1163
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:09,187
Why else would NASA
be sending a rocket

1164
01:28:09,189 --> 01:28:11,956
that's had one issue
after another to the Moon?

1165
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:14,158
Thanks for the insight, Buzz.

1166
01:28:16,462 --> 01:28:20,097
Always a pleasure with you.

1167
01:28:20,099 --> 01:28:22,133
Oh, it doesn't matter.
He's not in the lunar lottery.

1168
01:28:22,135 --> 01:28:24,202
And you are?

1169
01:28:24,204 --> 01:28:26,204
Well, the only guys
they let on the LLTV

1170
01:28:26,206 --> 01:28:28,838
since Neil's accident
are ones that might land.

1171
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:31,209
So you think you're going
to the Moon?

1172
01:28:31,211 --> 01:28:34,946
Well, it's been up for grabs
since Gus died.

1173
01:28:34,948 --> 01:28:38,183
I'm just saying
what you're thinking.

1174
01:28:42,322 --> 01:28:44,425
Well, maybe you shouldn't.

1175
01:28:49,263 --> 01:28:51,363
Apollo 8 clearing the VAB

1176
01:28:51,365 --> 01:28:54,165
- and headed for the launchpad.
- <i>Yeah!</i>

1177
01:28:59,406 --> 01:29:01,907
Hell of a rocket.

1178
01:29:01,909 --> 01:29:04,108
Yeah.

1179
01:29:04,110 --> 01:29:07,512
Everything stays on track,
11's gonna be the landing.

1180
01:29:07,514 --> 01:29:10,114
I talked to Bob.
Everyone's in agreement.

1181
01:29:10,116 --> 01:29:12,219
We'd like you to command.

1182
01:29:18,926 --> 01:29:20,158
Okay.

1183
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,132
<i>I can see a helicopter</i>

1184
01:29:27,134 --> 01:29:28,467
<i>vectoring that way.</i>

1185
01:29:28,469 --> 01:29:30,002
<i>It looks like a red dot</i>

1186
01:29:30,004 --> 01:29:31,903
with a long, long tail,
a long plume.

1187
01:29:31,905 --> 01:29:33,838
That's got to be
the spacecraft.

1188
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:36,308
That has to be
Apollo 10 reentering.

1189
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:39,178
And so the flight of Apollo 10

1190
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:43,282
has performed the major
function of its mission.

1191
01:29:43,284 --> 01:29:46,084
It has proved, through
these daring three astronauts,

1192
01:29:46,086 --> 01:29:49,054
that, uh, all of the systems
work properly

1193
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,057
and that there should be
no reason why man cannot,

1194
01:29:52,059 --> 01:29:54,259
perhaps as early as July,

1195
01:29:54,261 --> 01:29:57,630
land on that picked spot
on the Moon's equator.

1196
01:29:57,632 --> 01:29:59,998
These are sailors of the sky,

1197
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,101
and what, uh,
we've seen and heard today

1198
01:30:02,103 --> 01:30:06,004
make the great ocean voyages
of the earthbound

1199
01:30:06,006 --> 01:30:09,208
seem... well,
earthbound indeed.

1200
01:30:09,210 --> 01:30:12,110
For as the poet wrote,
the crew of Apollo 10

1201
01:30:12,112 --> 01:30:15,281
has "slipped
the surly bonds of Earth"

1202
01:30:15,283 --> 01:30:17,350
and carried us over
into tomorrow.

1203
01:30:17,352 --> 01:30:19,118
In the past few hours,

1204
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,920
man has come closer to the Moon
than ever in his history.

1205
01:30:21,922 --> 01:30:23,922
There were those
terrifying moments when...

1206
01:30:23,924 --> 01:30:25,892
Mom, what's wrong?

1207
01:30:25,894 --> 01:30:28,594
- Hmm?
- What's wrong?

1208
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:30,532
Nothing, honey.

1209
01:30:31,966 --> 01:30:34,066
Your dad's going to the Moon.

1210
01:30:34,068 --> 01:30:35,437
Okay.

1211
01:30:37,172 --> 01:30:39,640
Can I go outside?

1212
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:41,474
Sure.

1213
01:30:46,581 --> 01:30:48,448
Uh, we're here today

1214
01:30:48,450 --> 01:30:50,551
to talk about
the forthcoming flight.

1215
01:30:50,553 --> 01:30:54,320
But we're able to talk
about it because of, uh...

1216
01:30:54,322 --> 01:30:56,956
previous flights.

1217
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:59,292
Every flight
took on new objectives

1218
01:30:59,294 --> 01:31:03,629
and left us with very few
additions to be completed.

1219
01:31:03,631 --> 01:31:05,932
We're very grateful to those
people who made it possible

1220
01:31:05,934 --> 01:31:07,202
for us to be here today.

1221
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:10,303
All right,
we'll take some questions now.

1222
01:31:10,305 --> 01:31:12,306
Jim.

1223
01:31:12,308 --> 01:31:15,109
Neil, when you learned you were
going to command this flight,

1224
01:31:15,111 --> 01:31:17,644
were you surprised?
Overjoyed?

1225
01:31:17,646 --> 01:31:20,414
- I was pleased.
- Okay, but how would you compare

1226
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:22,115
this feeling
to winning an automobile

1227
01:31:22,117 --> 01:31:23,885
or being selected
as an astronaut?

1228
01:31:26,188 --> 01:31:28,123
I was pleased.

1229
01:31:29,425 --> 01:31:33,227
- Brian.
- Neil, if it does turn out,

1230
01:31:33,229 --> 01:31:34,628
you'll go down in history.

1231
01:31:34,630 --> 01:31:36,530
What kind of thoughts
do you have about that

1232
01:31:36,532 --> 01:31:38,165
when the thought hits you, uh,

1233
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:39,700
"Gosh, suppose
that flight's successful..."

1234
01:31:39,702 --> 01:31:41,435
We're planning on that flight
being successful.

1235
01:31:41,437 --> 01:31:43,604
Uh, I-I just meant,

1236
01:31:43,606 --> 01:31:46,475
how you feel about...
being a part of history.

1237
01:31:47,710 --> 01:31:50,344
I think I can shed
some light here.

1238
01:31:50,346 --> 01:31:53,280
It's a responsibility...

1239
01:31:53,282 --> 01:31:56,316
but it's exciting
to be the first.

1240
01:31:56,318 --> 01:31:59,253
Even my wife is excited.

1241
01:31:59,255 --> 01:32:02,490
She keeps slipping....
jewelry into my PPK.

1242
01:32:02,492 --> 01:32:04,691
You're planning on taking some of her jewelry

1243
01:32:04,693 --> 01:32:06,427
- to the Moon, Buzz?
- Sure.

1244
01:32:06,429 --> 01:32:08,162
Wh-What fella wouldn't want

1245
01:32:08,164 --> 01:32:10,164
to give his wife
bragging rights?

1246
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:14,302
Neil, will you take anything?

1247
01:32:14,304 --> 01:32:17,237
Uh, if I had a choice,
I'd take more fuel.

1248
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:20,143
All right, next question.

1249
01:32:31,321 --> 01:32:35,088
I thought you
were gonna talk to the boys.

1250
01:32:35,090 --> 01:32:38,493
What did you want me to say?

1251
01:32:38,495 --> 01:32:40,462
What do you want to say?

1252
01:32:40,464 --> 01:32:42,464
You're the one
that's going away.

1253
01:32:42,466 --> 01:32:44,702
Well, it's too late now.
They're asleep.

1254
01:32:47,504 --> 01:32:49,506
No, they're not, Neil.

1255
01:32:50,608 --> 01:32:52,607
You know they're not.

1256
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:55,811
Why can't you talk to them?

1257
01:32:55,813 --> 01:32:57,747
What are you doing?

1258
01:32:59,549 --> 01:33:02,585
Uh... I'm packing.

1259
01:33:02,587 --> 01:33:04,652
No.

1260
01:33:04,654 --> 01:33:07,758
You're just killing time
until you can get in the car.

1261
01:33:13,631 --> 01:33:15,732
- Okay.
- Okay.

1262
01:33:19,403 --> 01:33:22,305
Neil, I need you
to talk to the boys.

1263
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:26,208
Can you hear me?

1264
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:29,410
I need you to talk to the boys.
What are you doing?

1265
01:33:29,412 --> 01:33:30,813
Stop.

1266
01:33:30,815 --> 01:33:32,848
- I'm going to work.
- Well, just stop it.

1267
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:35,753
Just stop... just stop packing!

1268
01:33:49,400 --> 01:33:52,300
What are the chances
you're not coming back?

1269
01:33:52,302 --> 01:33:53,869
Hmm? What are the chances

1270
01:33:53,871 --> 01:33:56,405
this is the last time
the boys are gonna see you?

1271
01:33:56,407 --> 01:33:58,541
Well, I can't give you
an exact number.

1272
01:33:58,543 --> 01:34:00,811
I don't want
a fucking number, Neil!

1273
01:34:03,114 --> 01:34:05,581
It's not zero, is it?

1274
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:07,184
Is it?

1275
01:34:08,754 --> 01:34:09,852
No.

1276
01:34:09,854 --> 01:34:12,621
No. It's not.

1277
01:34:12,623 --> 01:34:15,624
Pat doesn't have a husband.

1278
01:34:15,626 --> 01:34:19,263
Those kids, they don't
have a father anymore.

1279
01:34:21,300 --> 01:34:23,501
Do you understand
what that means?

1280
01:34:25,303 --> 01:34:29,572
What are the chances
that's gonna be Ricky and Mark?

1281
01:34:29,574 --> 01:34:32,141
And I... I can't tell them

1282
01:34:32,143 --> 01:34:34,577
that their dad spent
the last few minutes

1283
01:34:34,579 --> 01:34:36,515
packing his briefcase!

1284
01:34:38,817 --> 01:34:41,350
You're gonna sit 'em down,
both of them,

1285
01:34:41,352 --> 01:34:43,520
and you're gonna prepare them
for the fact

1286
01:34:43,522 --> 01:34:45,789
that you might not
ever come home.

1287
01:34:45,791 --> 01:34:47,490
You're doing that.

1288
01:34:47,492 --> 01:34:49,292
You.

1289
01:34:49,294 --> 01:34:50,729
Not me.

1290
01:34:52,363 --> 01:34:53,832
I'm done.

1291
01:34:59,805 --> 01:35:03,407
So you better start thinking
about what you're gonna say.

1292
01:35:24,697 --> 01:35:26,964
Jimmy asked
what you're gonna say

1293
01:35:26,966 --> 01:35:29,267
when you get onto the Moon.

1294
01:35:34,539 --> 01:35:37,742
Well, we're not sure
we're gonna get onto the Moon.

1295
01:35:37,744 --> 01:35:40,911
Uh... a lot of things
have to go right

1296
01:35:40,913 --> 01:35:43,246
before that happens.

1297
01:35:43,248 --> 01:35:46,383
How long will you be gone?

1298
01:35:46,385 --> 01:35:48,886
Um... well,
we launch in ten days,

1299
01:35:48,888 --> 01:35:51,856
we'll be up for eight, and then
about a month in quarantine.

1300
01:35:51,858 --> 01:35:53,858
What's quarantine?

1301
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,897
We'll... be in isolation.

1302
01:35:59,699 --> 01:36:02,834
Uh, to protect
in case we, uh...

1303
01:36:02,836 --> 01:36:05,970
carry any diseases
from the lunar surface

1304
01:36:05,972 --> 01:36:08,539
or... something of that nature.

1305
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:10,877
It's not likely,
but it's a precaution.

1306
01:36:12,545 --> 01:36:15,948
So you won't be here
for my swim meet?

1307
01:36:25,826 --> 01:36:27,393
No.

1308
01:36:28,961 --> 01:36:30,764
Sorry.

1309
01:36:41,374 --> 01:36:43,844
Does anyone have
any other questions?

1310
01:36:46,612 --> 01:36:49,014
Do you think
you're coming back?

1311
01:36:49,016 --> 01:36:52,017
We have real confidence
in the mission.

1312
01:36:52,019 --> 01:36:54,486
And, uh, there are some risks,

1313
01:36:54,488 --> 01:36:57,488
but we have every intention
of coming back.

1314
01:36:57,490 --> 01:37:00,326
But you might not.

1315
01:37:13,841 --> 01:37:15,776
That's right.

1316
01:37:24,785 --> 01:37:26,253
Okay.

1317
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:29,623
Okay. Time for bed.

01:45:47,861 --> 01:45:50,296
Okay, we're operate 59:59.

1351
01:46:05,213 --> 01:46:07,346
Apollo 11, we track your speed

1352
01:46:07,348 --> 01:46:10,283
increasing
to 36,000 feet per second.

1353
01:46:10,285 --> 01:46:12,918
You are now leaving
Earth orbit.

1354
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:14,390
Apollo 11. Roger.

1355
01:46:23,498 --> 01:46:24,964
We have cutoff.

1356
01:46:24,966 --> 01:46:26,865
Uh, roger, 11.

1357
01:46:26,867 --> 01:46:29,201
Well, it certainly looks like
you're well on your way now.

1358
01:46:29,203 --> 01:46:31,204
Okay, Houston,
we're about to SEP.

1359
01:46:31,206 --> 01:46:32,606
Mike, you got it?

1360
01:46:32,608 --> 01:46:34,608
It's your ship now.

1361
01:47:09,445 --> 01:47:12,979
And you can start PTC
at your convenience.

1362
01:47:12,981 --> 01:47:15,183
All right, thank you, Houston.

1363
01:47:23,025 --> 01:47:24,525
That smells funny.

1364
01:47:24,527 --> 01:47:27,028
Like, uh, charred
electrical insulation.

1365
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:30,332
Might just be rocket fumes.

1366
01:47:32,268 --> 01:47:34,603
- Did you bring any music?
- No.

1367
01:47:36,205 --> 01:47:37,574
Here, Buzz.

1368
01:47:58,327 --> 01:48:00,328
Hey, Houston,
are you hearing this?

1369
01:49:11,769 --> 01:49:14,403
Apollo 11,
now entering lunar orbit.

1370
01:49:14,405 --> 01:49:16,338
Your roll should give you
a good view

1371
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,640
in about two minutes. Over.

1372
01:49:18,642 --> 01:49:21,342
When you have a
free minute, could you give us

1373
01:49:21,344 --> 01:49:24,814
your onboard readout
of N2 tank Bravo, please?

1374
01:49:24,816 --> 01:49:27,583
Nitrogen tank Bravo are showing

1375
01:49:27,585 --> 01:49:29,785
19-60, something like that.

1376
01:49:29,787 --> 01:49:31,590
Roger.

1377
01:50:21,238 --> 01:50:23,508
Would you look at that.

1378
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:49,667
This is a damn
three-ring circus.

1379
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:51,634
I got a fuel cell purge
in progress,

1380
01:50:51,636 --> 01:50:53,403
I'm watching
an auto maneuver and...

1381
01:50:53,405 --> 01:50:54,905
Jesus Christ.

1382
01:50:54,907 --> 01:50:57,140
Normal, normal.

1383
01:50:57,142 --> 01:50:59,877
Houston, stand by
for auto alarm.

1384
01:50:59,879 --> 01:51:01,912
Neil, the, uh...
the voice tape recorder,

1385
01:51:01,914 --> 01:51:03,346
- you know where that is?
- I don't know.

1386
01:51:03,348 --> 01:51:04,647
All this food
and stuff up here,

1387
01:51:04,649 --> 01:51:06,817
- you want any of that?
- No.

1388
01:51:06,819 --> 01:51:09,452
All right.
What about this chewing gum?

1389
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:11,321
You want any of that?

1390
01:51:11,323 --> 01:51:12,792
Mike.

1391
01:51:16,394 --> 01:51:18,263
Come back, will you?

1392
01:51:19,699 --> 01:51:22,533
Apollo 11, Houston.

1393
01:51:22,535 --> 01:51:24,702
Let us know when
you've entered the LEM,

1394
01:51:24,704 --> 01:51:26,638
closed up the hatch. Over.

1395
01:51:39,317 --> 01:51:41,185
<i>Eagle,</i> this is, uh, Houston.

1396
01:51:41,187 --> 01:51:42,854
We see the optics
zero switch on.

1397
01:51:42,856 --> 01:51:45,589
Uh, before you take some marks,
uh, don't forget

1398
01:51:45,591 --> 01:51:48,361
to cycle it back off and on,
and then on. Over.

1399
01:51:54,735 --> 01:51:56,834
<i>Eagle,</i> Houston,
could you give us a hack

1400
01:51:56,836 --> 01:51:59,470
on, uh, the time
that you switched to LEM power

1401
01:51:59,472 --> 01:52:03,776
and also verify that
we're on Glycol Pump One. Over.

1402
01:52:05,378 --> 01:52:07,812
This is <i>Eagle.</i>
We're on Pump One.

1403
01:52:07,814 --> 01:52:09,847
- Roger.
- <i>Eagle, Columbia.</i>

1404
01:52:09,849 --> 01:52:11,950
All 12 docking latches
are cocked.

1405
01:52:11,952 --> 01:52:14,551
- I'm ready to button up the hatch.
- Roger.

1406
01:52:14,553 --> 01:52:16,821
I'm gonna start a maneuver now

1407
01:52:16,823 --> 01:52:18,759
to our undocking attitude.

1408
01:52:19,826 --> 01:52:21,460
Okay.

1409
01:52:43,617 --> 01:52:46,017
How about using
as an undocking time

1410
01:52:46,019 --> 01:52:48,921
a hundred hours and 12 minutes?

1411
01:52:48,923 --> 01:52:51,956
- What have you got for AOS?
- I have a hundred hours

1412
01:52:51,958 --> 01:52:54,559
and 16 minutes.

1413
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:55,895
<i>Eagle,</i>

1414
01:52:55,897 --> 01:52:57,829
keep an eye on
your descent engine fuel.

1415
01:52:57,831 --> 01:53:01,332
Continuous burn time is limited
to 910 seconds.

1416
01:53:01,334 --> 01:53:04,669
Over.

1417
01:53:04,671 --> 01:53:07,775
Apollo 11, Houston.
We are go for undocking. Over.

1418
01:53:20,021 --> 01:53:22,957
15 seconds.

1419
01:53:28,763 --> 01:53:31,297
Okay, there you go.

1420
01:53:56,657 --> 01:53:59,091
<i>Eagle,</i> Houston.
We see you on the steerable.

1421
01:53:59,093 --> 01:54:01,393
- Over.
- The <i>Eagle</i> is undocked.

1422
01:54:01,395 --> 01:54:03,328
Roger. How does it look?

1423
01:54:03,330 --> 01:54:04,997
The <i>Eagle</i> has wings.

1424
01:54:39,902 --> 01:54:41,837
It just won't stay.

1425
01:54:43,872 --> 01:54:45,972
<i>Eagle,</i> report status. Over.

1426
01:54:45,974 --> 01:54:47,641
We'll have to tell them
about that.

1427
01:54:47,643 --> 01:54:50,543
Let's prep for descent.

1428
01:54:50,545 --> 01:54:51,845
<i>Eagle,</i> Houston.

1429
01:54:51,847 --> 01:54:53,547
You're a go
for powered descent.

1430
01:54:53,549 --> 01:54:55,749
Roger. Read you.

1431
01:55:00,156 --> 01:55:02,991
Altitude light's on.
We don't have radar data.

1432
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:10,833
Let's proceed.

1433
01:55:12,434 --> 01:55:14,001
Proceed.

1434
01:55:14,003 --> 01:55:15,769
One.

1435
01:55:15,771 --> 01:55:17,470
Zero.

1436
01:55:17,472 --> 01:55:18,705
Ignition.

1437
01:55:28,016 --> 01:55:31,052
Program alarm.

1438
01:55:31,054 --> 01:55:34,754
- What's a 1202 alarm?
- I don't know.

1439
01:55:34,756 --> 01:55:38,158
Houston, give us a reading
on the 1202 program alarm.

1440
01:55:38,160 --> 01:55:40,427
Roger, we got you.
We're a go on that alarm.

1441
01:55:46,668 --> 01:55:48,035
Same alarm.

1442
01:55:48,037 --> 01:55:50,037
Roger.
We're a go on that alarm.

1443
01:56:15,098 --> 01:56:19,034
- Okay, 3,000 at 70.
- Roger. Understand.

1444
01:56:19,036 --> 01:56:21,202
Program alarm. 1201.

1445
01:56:21,204 --> 01:56:23,673
Roger. 1201 alarm.

1446
01:56:27,577 --> 01:56:30,446
Same type. We're a go.

1447
01:57:02,545 --> 01:57:04,480
Pretty rocky area.

1448
01:57:07,785 --> 01:57:10,619
Those boulders are
as big as cars.

1449
01:57:10,621 --> 01:57:11,989
We can't land there.

1450
01:57:19,931 --> 01:57:21,865
Go into manual.

1451
01:57:33,077 --> 01:57:35,278
540 feet down to 30.

1452
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,579
Watch your fuel.

1453
01:57:37,581 --> 01:57:40,015
330.

1454
01:57:40,017 --> 01:57:42,020
300 feet,
down three and a half.

1455
01:57:47,258 --> 01:57:48,525
Fuel's at eight percent.

1456
01:57:52,596 --> 01:57:55,264
Radar's lost track of the surface again.

1457
01:57:55,266 --> 01:57:58,700
160 feet, six and a half down.

1458
01:57:58,702 --> 01:58:01,506
Five and a half down,
nine forward.

1459
01:58:04,943 --> 01:58:08,643
Low level. Low level.

1460
01:58:08,645 --> 01:58:09,912
120 feet.

1461
01:58:09,914 --> 01:58:12,915
Five percent fuel remaining.

1462
01:58:12,917 --> 01:58:15,885
Quantity light.

1463
01:58:15,887 --> 01:58:17,687
94 seconds to bingo.

1464
01:58:17,689 --> 01:58:19,858
114's a mandatory abort.

1465
01:58:24,729 --> 01:58:27,263
Down a half. Six forward.

1466
01:58:27,265 --> 01:58:29,132
Stand by for 60. Roger.

1467
01:58:29,134 --> 01:58:32,101
60 seconds.

1468
01:58:32,103 --> 01:58:33,705
40 feet, down two and a half.

1469
01:58:39,778 --> 01:58:41,144
Stand by for 30.

1470
01:58:41,146 --> 01:58:42,779
- 30 seconds.
- Forward.

1471
01:58:46,285 --> 01:58:48,553
20 feet, down a half.

1472
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,325
Faint shadow.
Drifting forward,

1473
01:58:56,327 --> 01:58:58,164
just a little bit.

1474
01:59:29,395 --> 01:59:31,429
Contact light.

1475
01:59:33,032 --> 01:59:34,967
Shutdown.

1476
01:59:46,011 --> 01:59:48,181
We copy you down, <i>Eagle.</i>

1477
01:59:52,084 --> 01:59:54,219
Houston...

1478
01:59:54,221 --> 01:59:56,155
Tranquility Base here.

1479
01:59:58,224 --> 02:00:00,757
The <i>Eagle</i> has landed.

1480
02:00:00,759 --> 02:00:02,693
Roger, Tranq... Tranquility.

1481
02:00:02,695 --> 02:00:04,027
We copy you on the ground.

1482
02:00:04,029 --> 02:00:06,264
You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.

1483
02:00:06,266 --> 02:00:08,234
We're breathing again.
Thanks a lot.

1484
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:12,172
Thank you.

1485
02:00:15,308 --> 02:00:17,710
Very smooth touchdown.

1486
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:07,153
Okay, Neil,

1487
02:02:07,155 --> 02:02:10,155
we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

1488
02:02:20,134 --> 02:02:22,001
Okay, I just checked.

1489
02:02:22,003 --> 02:02:26,274
Uh, coming back up to that
first step, Buzz, it's, uh...

1490
02:02:28,343 --> 02:02:30,410
The strut
hasn't collapsed too far,

1491
02:02:30,412 --> 02:02:32,579
but, uh, it's adequate
to get back up.

1492
02:02:32,581 --> 02:02:34,147
Roger. We copy.

1493
02:02:34,149 --> 02:02:36,485
Takes a pretty good
little jump.

1494
02:02:53,268 --> 02:02:55,569
Uh, Buzz, this is Houston.

1495
02:02:55,571 --> 02:02:59,439
F-two, one 160th second
for shadow photography

1496
02:02:59,441 --> 02:03:01,444
on the sequence camera.

1497
02:03:02,878 --> 02:03:04,313
Okay.

1498
02:03:07,517 --> 02:03:10,383
I'm, uh,
at the foot of the ladder.

1499
02:03:10,385 --> 02:03:13,587
The LEM footpads
are only, uh...

1500
02:03:13,589 --> 02:03:16,524
uh, depressed in the surface

1501
02:03:16,526 --> 02:03:19,460
about, uh, one or two inches.

1502
02:03:19,462 --> 02:03:24,231
Although the surface
appears to be, uh,

1503
02:03:24,233 --> 02:03:27,100
very, very fine-grained
as you get close to it.

1504
02:03:27,102 --> 02:03:30,571
It's almost like a powder
down there.

1505
02:03:30,573 --> 02:03:32,374
Uh, very fine.

1506
02:03:41,417 --> 02:03:44,286
I'm gonna step off the LEM now.

1507
02:03:55,198 --> 02:03:57,866
That's one small step
for man...

1508
02:04:00,103 --> 02:04:03,272
...one giant leap for mankind.

1509
02:05:33,263 --> 02:05:36,131
Okay, you ready
for me to come out?

1510
02:08:56,569 --> 02:08:59,738
Five, four, three,

1511
02:08:59,740 --> 02:09:01,639
two, one.

1512
02:09:01,641 --> 02:09:02,975
Ignition.

1513
02:09:11,819 --> 02:09:13,852
<i>...I suppose they can</i>

1514
02:09:13,854 --> 02:09:16,021
<i>never really, uh,
describe to us.</i>

1515
02:09:16,023 --> 02:09:17,456
<i>So we'll never know.</i>

1516
02:09:17,458 --> 02:09:20,626
<i>And it may not be
a beauty that one can pass on</i>

1517
02:09:20,628 --> 02:09:22,428
<i>to future beholders, either.</i>

1518
02:09:22,430 --> 02:09:25,264
<i>These first men on the Moon
have seen something</i>

1519
02:09:25,266 --> 02:09:28,400
<i>that men who follow
will have missed.</i>

1520
02:09:28,402 --> 02:09:30,536
<i>They've peered
into another life</i>

1521
02:09:30,538 --> 02:09:33,038
<i>that, uh, we can't follow.</i>

1522
02:09:33,040 --> 02:09:35,274
<i>Bob Simon at Trafalgar Square,</i>

1523
02:09:35,276 --> 02:09:36,976
<i>where he joined the thousands</i>

1524
02:09:36,978 --> 02:09:39,378
<i>who watched an immense
television screen</i>

1525
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:41,613
<i>as the Apollo touched down
on the Moon.</i>

1526
02:09:41,615 --> 02:09:43,716
<i>The average
Romanian thinks of Apollo 11</i>

1527
02:09:43,718 --> 02:09:46,019
<i>a little bit
as his own personal adventure.</i>

1528
02:09:46,021 --> 02:09:48,454
<i>It's been estimated
that the audience</i>

1529
02:09:48,456 --> 02:09:50,389
<i>was up in the hundreds
of millions.</i>

1530
02:09:50,391 --> 02:09:53,860
<i>Perhaps 400 million persons
or so watching this broadcast.</i>

1531
02:09:53,862 --> 02:09:55,594
<i>Countless millions more</i>

1532
02:09:55,596 --> 02:09:57,830
<i>listened on the radio
to the voices from the Moon.</i>

1533
02:09:57,832 --> 02:10:00,400
<i>Never before had so many people</i>

1534
02:10:00,402 --> 02:10:02,568
<i>been attuned to one event
at one time.</i>

1535
02:10:04,572 --> 02:10:06,973
<i>...is on the Moon. Of course...</i>

1536
02:10:06,975 --> 02:10:08,741
<i>...feats of all time.</i>

1537
02:10:08,743 --> 02:10:10,744
<i>Does it amaze you
that it's taken place?</i>

1538
02:10:10,746 --> 02:10:12,612
<i>It not only amazes me,
but I'm certain</i>

1539
02:10:12,614 --> 02:10:13,980
<i>that it amazes everybody
in this country.</i>

1540
02:10:13,982 --> 02:10:16,082
<i>What do you think of it?</i>

1541
02:10:16,084 --> 02:10:17,784
<i>Well, the Moon, I hope...</i>

1542
02:10:17,786 --> 02:10:19,451
<i>that sometime everybody
will go there.</i>

1543
02:10:19,453 --> 02:10:20,720
- <i>Want to go yourself?</i>
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

1544
02:10:20,722 --> 02:10:22,088
<i>I wish I can go right now.</i>

1545
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:24,557
<i>I think this
is a very important day.</i>

1546
02:10:24,559 --> 02:10:27,827
<i>It's a historical day for...
and the whole universe</i>

1547
02:10:27,829 --> 02:10:29,896
is concerned about this,
the landing on the Moon.

1548
02:10:29,898 --> 02:10:31,697
And as a French woman,

1549
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:33,933
- how do you think about it?
- Oh, I think it's wonderful.

1550
02:10:33,935 --> 02:10:36,503
I always trusted America,
and I knew they couldn't fail.

1551
02:10:36,505 --> 02:10:37,971
And in Washington,

1552
02:10:37,973 --> 02:10:40,106
an anonymous citizen
placed a small bouquet

1553
02:10:40,108 --> 02:10:43,077
on the grave of John F. Kennedy
with a note:

1554
02:10:43,079 --> 02:10:46,079
"Mr. President,
the <i>Eagle</i> has landed."

1555
02:10:46,081 --> 02:10:50,416
And indeed on this day, as we
mark the astronauts' return,

1556
02:10:50,418 --> 02:10:52,752
it's hard not to think back
upon that speech

1557
02:10:52,754 --> 02:10:55,922
our 35th president gave
just seven short years ago.

1558
02:10:55,924 --> 02:10:58,758
If this capsule
history of our progress

1559
02:10:58,760 --> 02:11:01,828
teaches us anything,
it is that man,

1560
02:11:01,830 --> 02:11:03,730
in his quest for knowledge
and progress,

1561
02:11:03,732 --> 02:11:07,101
is determined
and cannot be deterred.

1562
02:11:07,103 --> 02:11:09,636
But why, some say, the Moon?

1563
02:11:09,638 --> 02:11:12,807
Why choose this as our goal?

1564
02:11:12,809 --> 02:11:16,977
And they may well ask,
why climb the highest mountain?

1565
02:11:16,979 --> 02:11:20,915
Why, 35 years ago,
fly the Atlantic?

1566
02:11:20,917 --> 02:11:23,450
Why does Rice play Texas?

1567
02:11:23,452 --> 02:11:25,752
We choose to go to the Moon.

1568
02:11:25,754 --> 02:11:30,424
We choose to go to the Moon...

1569
02:11:30,426 --> 02:11:33,093
We choose to go to the Moon
in this decade

1570
02:11:33,095 --> 02:11:34,895
and do the other things,

1571
02:11:34,897 --> 02:11:38,833
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

1572
02:11:42,805 --> 02:11:45,041
How do you feel?

1573
02:11:46,976 --> 02:11:48,411
How happy are you?

1574
02:11:49,779 --> 02:11:51,579
Have you spoken
with your husband?

1575
02:11:51,581 --> 02:11:53,882
Would your sons like to be
astronauts like him?

1576
02:11:53,884 --> 02:11:55,116
Mrs. Armstrong.

1577
02:11:55,118 --> 02:11:57,051
Ha-Have all your prayers
been answered?

1578
02:11:57,053 --> 02:11:58,652
Yes, yes, they have.

1579
02:11:58,654 --> 02:12:01,056
How would you describe
the flight?

1580
02:12:01,058 --> 02:12:05,727
Well, uh, I can only say
it was, uh, out of this world.
