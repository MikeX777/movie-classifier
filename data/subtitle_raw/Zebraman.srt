1
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:51,650
Here we see the seals heading upstream.
This is unheard of this time of year.

2
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,217
Now, we take you to Yokohama.

3
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:05,955
People are discovering a lot of strange
things lately, including oversize fish.

4
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:13,636
Also, reports of kidnappings
and rape are on the rise...

5
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:15,831
That's some weird stuff.

6
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,002
The world sure is crazy.

7
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:19,979
Ya know...

8
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:20,570
Yes?

9
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,339
I need another drink.

10
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,218
Please stop it.

11
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,150
Just one more.

12
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,018
Save some for the other customers.

13
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:34,451
There aren't many other customers.

14
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:35,862
You're right.

15
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,830
I'm always right. Remember that.

16
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:52,008
Human-like lifeforms have been spotted.

17
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,546
And the police?

18
00:01:58,785 --> 00:01:59,719
It's only between us.

19
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,423
This is difficult. We're not "ultra police".

20
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,754
Hear me out.

21
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:13,366
America has had reports of similar sightings.

22
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,003
No one knows for sure what they are.

23
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,197
You believe it?

24
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:26,739
Our defense force is ordered
to investigate these incidents.

25
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:31,974
We cannot panic the public, so all
investigations must be in secret.

26
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,085
We're leaving it to the two of you to solve the case.

27
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:42,393
We have no other choice.

28
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,363
Do you accept?

29
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,362
Oikawa-san...

30
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,373
I don't know.

31
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,575
Are you afraid?

32
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:58,271
You won't have much backup in the field.

33
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,042
This is crazy.

34
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:03,739
I feel like an idiot.

35
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:26,903
Super Power Sentai!

36
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:29,397
Aleki Thunder!

37
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,741
But, I'm your mother!

38
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,145
You're lying!

39
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,293
Damn you. I'll get you now.

40
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,977
Fire!

41
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,181
I won't allow you to do what you want!

42
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,121
What was all that?

43
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,595
Whatever...

44
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,508
Ota, it hurts. It hurts.

45
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,283
Please stop it.

46
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:17,772
Idiot.

47
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,649
It's camouflage.

48
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,015
Eh?

49
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:25,318
It's weird for two men to be in the same apartment.

50
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,093
This is less suspicious.

51
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,590
Ah, now I understand.

52
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,759
I'll be more careful.

53
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,461
What a dump!

54
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:39,872
Give me the lunch.

55
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:40,361
Yes.

56
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:46,077
Please don't do anything weird.

57
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,680
Idiot.

58
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,944
No worries. No worries.

59
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:54,921
Are our orders here?

60
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,149
Yes, it's here.

61
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:03,663
The alien lifeform in Yokohama
gives off a certain sound wave...

62
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:04,459
Skip that.

63
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:05,765
Yes?

64
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,993
Do you have a girlfriend now?

65
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,900
Yes, I do.

66
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:12,271
It gives off a wave...

67
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,295
Enough of that.

68
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:19,172
What do we do when we detect the wave?

69
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,507
Call headquarters.

70
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:22,640
Understood.

71
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,478
What are you doing?

72
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,378
Calling headquarters.

73
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,954
Alien.

74
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,665
I have a girlfriend now. Really.

75
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:42,528
We've been dating for one year.

76
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,130
Please wait for love.

77
00:06:46,773 --> 00:07:05,525
This evening in Yokohama, a
criminal wearing a crab mask...

78
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,617
Is it good, Kazuki?

79
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:28,507
Starting today, I will be your regular teacher.

80
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:31,780
No way.

81
00:07:45,698 --> 00:07:48,166
Your father is your teacher! Idiot!

82
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,862
Pathetic! Pathetic!

83
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:51,870
Get lost!

84
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:56,370
Cut the crap! Pathetic! Get lost!

85
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,005
Kazuki...

86
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:06,779
Just give me more time.

87
00:08:09,555 --> 00:08:10,783
But I...

88
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:16,552
It will all work out in time.

89
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,070
Hey, where are you going?

90
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,764
Out.

91
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,365
Wadda ya mean "out"?

92
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:28,137
You can't go out.

93
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,406
Why not?

94
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,302
Because...

95
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,446
You still have chores to do.

96
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:35,812
I'm going.

97
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:42,488
I'm telling you you can't go out. It's a school night.

98
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,716
I'm home.

99
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,424
You going out?

100
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:46,220
Yeah.

101
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:47,724
I see.

102
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:49,827
Let me give you some money...

103
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:58,960
Thanks. I'm going.

104
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:03,707
What?

105
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,208
You're home early...

106
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:11,274
I'm home.

107
00:09:12,251 --> 00:09:14,412
What a pain...

108
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,848
No one listens...

109
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,149
Midori is at that age...

110
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,725
I guess it can't be helped.

111
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,450
Yes!

112
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,112
Black and White Ecstasy!

113
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:25,512
Zebraman!

114
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:32,693
Zebra Screeeew Punch!

115
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,169
Zebra Back Kick!

116
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,838
Zebra Bomber!

117
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,991
You're not gonna...

118
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,655
keep me down!

119
00:11:15,307 --> 00:11:16,865
Not again!

120
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,520
Prof. Ichikawa.

121
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,219
Yes?

122
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,267
This is Asano Shinpei-kun. A transfer student.

123
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:48,204
Transfer student?

124
00:11:53,913 --> 00:12:00,819
Don't scare him. Do your best.

125
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:05,015
Yes. I got it.

126
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,756
I'll leave you three alone. Bye.

127
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:11,997
Nice to meet you.

128
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:15,455
This is our newest teacher, Prof. Ichikawa.

129
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:18,298
Nice to meet you.

130
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,540
We'll be sure to treat you great.

131
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:26,471
He's normal.

132
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:30,373
What?

133
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:36,377
Even though he can't walk, he's
still a regular junior high student.

134
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:41,852
Excuse me.

135
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:46,895
So, Asano-kun, let's go.

136
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:47,961
Yes.

137
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:48,891
Take care.

138
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:54,799
Okay, from today we have a
new class mate. Asano-kun.

139
00:12:55,875 --> 00:12:58,867
I'm Shinpei Asano. Nice to meet you.

140
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,671
Nice to meet you.

141
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:04,777
That's good everyone.

142
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:11,515
His paralysis was very sudden.

143
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,356
All the hospitals we went to didn't understand it.

144
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:23,292
Each day I wonder if he'll ever be able to stand again.

145
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:26,668
His dad?

146
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,074
I'm a single parent.

147
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,140
Sorry.

148
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,179
It's no problem.

149
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,448
I see. Sorry.

150
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,687
Professor...

151
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,686
I don't want him to be treated special.

152
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:53,791
I don't want any bad things to happen.

153
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:59,028
What do you mean, "bad things"?

154
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,869
Other students may resent him.

155
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,043
I understand.

156
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,248
I'll treat him like any other student.

157
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,291
Thank you.

158
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,278
Hey...

159
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,074
What?

160
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:44,382
What kind of person are you, Kitahara-kun?

161
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:49,753
I may not look it, but I'm a ghost-man.

162
00:14:50,856 --> 00:14:51,845
Really?

163
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:52,682
Yeah.

164
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,385
No way.

165
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:55,953
Then prove it.

166
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,896
Okay. Here.

167
00:15:18,717 --> 00:15:19,945
It's a white panda?

168
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,049
How'd you get it?

169
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,557
I told you I'm a ghost man.

170
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:27,184
It's really cute.

171
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:34,227
Hey, hey. What does your father do?

172
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:40,669
Ah! A school teacher!

173
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:46,137
It really sucks. He's not even popular.

174
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:54,217
It's my dad's fault that little brother is picked on...

175
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,348
And mom is unhappy...

176
00:15:56,889 --> 00:15:58,550
Really?

177
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,422
Yes. It really is his fault.

178
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,256
So, are we done?

179
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:11,165
No way. One more time.

180
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,565
One more time.

181
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,371
Yes, yes.

182
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,633
Yes, yes.

183
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,773
Yes, yes.

184
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,167
Yes, yes.

185
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:34,716
I could just go to the corner and buy some juice...

186
00:16:36,862 --> 00:16:38,193
No, no, no...

187
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:41,263
I might catch cold.

188
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:39,976
Teacher.

189
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,844
I finished.

190
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:45,579
Yes.

191
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,815
Teacher, do like sports?

192
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:21,550
To be honest, not really.

193
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:27,427
Hey, what were you working on in class?

194
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,598
Who was it?

195
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,204
Did you draw it?

196
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,643
It's Zebraman.

197
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:44,672
You know him?

198
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,118
Uh... yeah.

199
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:53,722
I watched him on TV when I was in Junior High.

200
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:07,303
Now, everyone, let's all watch
Zebraman's TV preview together.

201
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:21,084
In the year 2010, a mysterious hero appears.

202
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:23,914
Zebraaaaman!

203
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,549
Fight, Zebraman!

204
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:35,799
Fly, Zebraman!

205
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,205
Black and White Ecstasy!

206
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,370
Zebraman!

207
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:54,749
Jyumonji Yuzuru defends the
Earth against evil alien invaders!

208
00:20:55,621 --> 00:21:05,360
The series was cancelled after only 13
episodes, but fans still remember it.

209
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,465
There's a lot of news about it on the internet.

210
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,764
Turn on the Black and White!

211
00:21:14,873 --> 00:21:16,602
Here's some printouts.

212
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:35,459
Zebraman isn't just about a super hero,

213
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,494
It's about believing in your dreams.

214
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:56,908
Whether we had a color TV or not,

215
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:04,889
we would still sing the theme song after it was over.

216
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,088
That's really good.

217
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,529
Yeah, it is.

218
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,264
It's great, teacher.

219
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,894
That you remember this show.

220
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,500
I feel like I'm talking with my father.

221
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:31,177
Ah. What about the main character?

222
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,345
He was a junior high school teacher.

223
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,721
A teacher like me.

224
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:48,759
But, my students don't really take me seriously.

225
00:22:55,207 --> 00:23:05,082
Maybe I should practice my yelling at them?

226
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,050
Teacher, do you know what year this is?

227
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:14,089
This year?

228
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:18,326
It's 2010.

229
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:29,905
That's right. It's the same year
that Zebraman took place.

230
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,016
Asano.

231
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:44,279
Yes?

232
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:53,660
From today, can I call you Asano?

233
00:23:58,837 --> 00:23:59,633
Yes.

234
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:24,462
Hey, I wonder...

235
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:28,164
If we find this lifeform...

236
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,889
Yes.

237
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,792
Let's beat its head in.

238
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:32,464
No way.

239
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,471
We have to follow orders.

240
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,074
But...

241
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:36,870
Yes?

242
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:40,244
I feel like spoiled milk.

243
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,648
Air conditioner?

244
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,816
No air conditioner.

245
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,612
What?

246
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:49,515
There's no space for one...

247
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:07,694
Prof. Ichikawa...

248
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:11,371
Yes?

249
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:17,272
I think it's good.

250
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,440
What is?

251
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,018
You haven't heard anything.

252
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:30,720
Today, Prof. Ichikawa will go
on patrol with Prof. Ippongi.

253
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,595
Nice to meet you!

254
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,961
Everyone, count on me.

255
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:38,625
Hello.

256
00:25:46,678 --> 00:25:53,777
What are you guys doing here?
It's late. Go home, go home!

257
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:58,123
Are you sure that's okay?

258
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:01,752
What do you mean? It is for their own good.

259
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,288
Professor, are you hungry?

260
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:10,832
Have some, have some.

261
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:16,696
The thing I hate the most is perverts.

262
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:21,539
At least yakuza punks live by a code of honor.

263
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,217
But perverts, I can never forgive them.

264
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,445
Now, I'll eat.

265
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,214
It's really good.

266
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,326
It is good.

267
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,625
Ah yes, well you see...

268
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,589
I'm an expert on this kind of food.

269
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,736
But my real passion is to be...

270
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,838
An English teacher at a girl's school.

271
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:54,776
But I'm so embarassed!

272
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,481
So what's the problem?

273
00:27:00,185 --> 00:27:01,948
The problem is the Sailor Suit.

274
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,885
Why is that a problem?

275
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,288
It's difficult to walk.

276
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,290
That's it?

277
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:28,544
Oh look! It's 9 o'clock. We'd better get going.

278
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:48,429
It's still bad.

279
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,458
But I want to show Asano.

280
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:57,574
Asano, Asano, Asano...

281
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:01,778
Nakayama-cho 2-chome 553

282
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,078
Nice neighborhood.

283
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:12,088
What? That's not it.

284
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:21,030
Not Asano's address. Sakura-machi 30.

285
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,967
What?

286
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:30,070
Andoh.

287
00:28:33,478 --> 00:28:34,410
Andoh?

288
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:40,278
Andoh.

289
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,221
Sakura-machi 3-chome 15. Asano.

290
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,492
There's no doubt.

291
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:25,521
Can't be seen like this.

292
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:32,764
You're fired. You're fired. You're fired...

293
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:38,135
I'm a fan.

294
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:39,560
What are you?

295
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,538
Zebraman.

296
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,451
I'm Zebraman.

297
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,557
I'm Zebraman.

298
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:03,318
Die!

299
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,516
That hurt.

300
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,356
Be careful.

301
00:31:40,698 --> 00:31:41,630
Be careful.

302
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:01,076
What?

303
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,041
What the hell?

304
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,694
Hey, Hey! A wave reaction.

305
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:47,932
Let's go.

306
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:48,921
What?

307
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:51,766
Hurry up!

308
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:54,595
Zebra Screw Punch.

309
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:05,246
It's Zebraman...

310
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,510
Hey, what's going on?

311
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:11,114
Ah, nothing.

312
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,652
Nothing, huh?

313
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:16,056
It's late.

314
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:17,950
You're alone?

315
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:21,029
Is your mom nearby?

316
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,857
Seigawa. Seigawa!

317
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:24,366
Yes!

318
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:47,723
There was another murder.

319
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:52,457
It seems connected to the others.

320
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:56,362
Of course, we want everyone to be on guard.

321
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:57,931
That's it.

322
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:09,308
The victim last night seemed
to be covered in green goo.

323
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:17,820
I heard it from my friends,
even though the police deny it.

324
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:23,920
And there's nothing about it on TV.

325
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,681
Hey! What are you doing?

326
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,274
Zebraman Punch!

327
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,960
Take this.

328
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:36,994
I'm good.

329
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:38,120
This way?

330
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,300
Take a look at the body.

331
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:57,575
Ready? It's a bit hard to look at.

332
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,593
How could that have happened?

333
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,933
Look at the wound...

334
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,501
Oikawa-san?

335
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:17,990
Hmm?

336
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,032
Nothing.

337
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:20,671
I'm done.

338
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:21,262
I don't get it.

339
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,403
I'm done.

340
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,140
Burn it.

341
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:26,737
Ready!

342
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,077
Light up!

343
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,518
Fire!

344
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:53,865
The cases seem to be around
the general area of this school.

345
00:37:55,706 --> 00:37:58,409
Can I speak freely about the cases?

346
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:03,437
Yes, of course. You can ask me anything.

347
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:08,051
What's weird about these cases is that

348
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,779
They haven't been reported
on TV or in the newspapers.

349
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:17,119
Hey, what are you implying?

350
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:21,957
Last night, a lot of people
were unaware of the danger.

351
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:25,828
Do you intend to let more people die?

352
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:27,733
Prof. Kyoto...

353
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,308
Are you afraid of something?

354
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:38,572
Well, there might be a panic...

355
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:41,710
Our first concern is for our students.

356
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:47,815
Our concern is to solve the cases.

357
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,661
Professor, these two cases are...

358
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,455
I won't answer you!

359
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,498
You make me sick!

360
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:20,851
I wonder if it was the real Zebraman?

361
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:23,890
Asano-san...

362
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:29,457
I hope that I can meet him again.

363
00:39:30,668 --> 00:39:31,896
I see.

364
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,393
I see.

365
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,510
You can watch Zebraman on here.

366
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,144
Really?

367
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:51,688
It's the first episode of Zebraman.

368
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:57,456
I remember, I remember. It's Zebraman!

369
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,498
Ah! There! There! The Screw Punch, right?

370
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,235
I'm home.

371
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,870
Welcome home.

372
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,909
Ah, professor...

373
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,536
Ah, excuse me.

374
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,638
He was teaching me.

375
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:20,382
Professor Ichikawa is a fan of Zebraman!

376
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,947
It makes me feel very nostalgic.

377
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:28,484
Now I'll make dinner.

378
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:29,215
Yes.

379
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:34,162
Ah, no, no. I should go.

380
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:50,574
Please.

381
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:51,947
Thanks.

382
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,055
What is it?

383
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:03,086
Professor, you should eat your vegetables.

384
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,989
Oh, really?

385
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,597
Well, the truth is...

386
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,392
Need help?

387
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,599
I got it.

388
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:45,594
I see.

389
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,996
Your family?

390
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:56,512
Oh, that's right. I forgot. I should go.

391
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:01,047
That's not what I meant.

392
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,588
A wife and two kids.

393
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,454
I see.

394
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,522
What about you?

395
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:19,031
His father committed suicide.

396
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:27,871
I'm sorry. I shouldn't burden you.

397
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:50,696
He was a junior at the university hospital.

398
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,202
My son saw the whole thing.

399
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,746
He jumped from the building.

400
00:43:08,285 --> 00:43:09,217
Yes.

401
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,992
I really should go home.

402
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,006
Zebra Nurse!!

403
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:52,384
Please.

404
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:57,116
Don't worry, Zebraman.

405
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:42,961
Zebraman.

406
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:12,965
Dream?

407
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:22,002
Damn.

408
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,880
Sorry. I'll be back soon.

409
00:47:41,792 --> 00:47:45,091
Zebra Bomber!

410
00:48:24,268 --> 00:48:25,102
White and Black Man!

411
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,034
No!

412
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,306
Horse Man!

413
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:30,432
No!

414
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,213
Zebra Double Kick!

415
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,456
Ah, sorry, sorry.

416
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,988
Where were we...

417
00:48:56,667 --> 00:49:01,405
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

418
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,201
Teacher...

419
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,265
The time is up.

420
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,506
Sorry, sorry. Let's go.

421
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:18,615
A striped man?

422
00:49:20,223 --> 00:49:28,927
Well, if there is such a man running
around like that, then he must be an idiot.

423
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,131
Zebraman isn't an idiot!

424
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:33,860
What-man?

425
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,238
Asano-kun...

426
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,470
Did you see him?

427
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:52,581
No, I didn't.

428
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,054
But, Zebraman isn't an idiot.

429
00:49:56,526 --> 00:49:58,050
He's a savior.

430
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:03,567
Hey...

431
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:05,535
I'll be there soon.

432
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:10,037
What did Asano tell you?

433
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:11,639
That kid...

434
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,339
What are you doing?

435
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:20,245
That kid...

436
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:23,413
What he said...

437
00:50:23,653 --> 00:50:25,814
Cut the crap!

438
00:50:25,956 --> 00:50:32,225
I have to solve these cases! I don't
have time to waste with this crap!

439
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,610
I'm trying to analyze its programme.

440
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,272
Yes.

441
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:52,281
Mr. Kanda.

442
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,916
I think it's impossible to find out any more.

443
00:50:58,255 --> 00:50:59,688
But headquarters is waiting for results.

444
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,422
Having to examine in secret slows me down.

445
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:04,620
What we need to find out...

446
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,630
Is how this is spread from person to person.

447
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:12,627
It can spread from Yokohama
to cover the whole country.

448
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:16,934
Please don't rush me, Oikawa-san.

449
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:21,141
Enough of this crap!

450
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:26,304
Whose idea was this anyway?!

451
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:41,126
We're not getting anywhere. It's
beyond human comprehension.

452
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,020
What do you mean transfer?

453
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:13,960
To another school?

454
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:18,167
We had no choice. The kids are in danger.

455
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:20,203
Danger?

456
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:20,794
Yes.

457
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,203
Shinpei Asano is in danger.

458
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,941
I don't understand what you mean?

459
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,812
If the students are in danger...

460
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,040
You don't have to know.

461
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:35,613
Don't worry. As of tomorrow, they'll be safe.

462
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:40,390
Prof. Kyoto...

463
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,382
The families all agree.

464
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,355
What is it you know?

465
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:48,958
What do you mean?

466
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:56,328
You know something about the case.

467
00:52:58,708 --> 00:52:59,902
I'm asking you to stop.

468
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:03,810
It's not just the cases that put the students in danger.

469
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:06,545
What is it?

470
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,754
What do you know?

471
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,808
Excuse me. I'll go fix it.

472
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,310
I'm not done talking with you.

473
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,244
But, my hair...

474
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:36,405
Who cares about your hair?

475
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,845
I have to go to the toilet.

476
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:40,510
Professor...

477
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,951
Why do you need your bag?

478
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,681
Is there something in there?

479
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,392
Let me see what's inside!

480
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,416
W-what?

481
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:53,896
What could be so important?

482
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,401
Hey, wait!

483
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:05,765
We're not finished!

484
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,426
Eh, uh, eh, uh...

485
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:20,344
Great food and great prices. Have some now.

486
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,730
What would you like, kids?

487
00:55:41,104 --> 00:55:42,435
Where are your mothers?

488
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,798
What are you doing?

489
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,682
Why'd you do that?

490
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:55,518
Don't eat all that!

491
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,349
Wait! Wait!

492
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,886
Do you guys have money?

493
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,729
Stop it, you brats!

494
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:25,238
Stop it you brats!

495
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:43,700
Hurry, hurry! Help me! Shoot them!

496
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,634
I can't shoot children!

497
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:46,893
What's up?

498
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,833
Chief, there's big trouble.

499
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,539
Come on, stop it.

500
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,435
Kazuki?

501
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:36,977
Wait!

502
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,334
Okay, stop.

503
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:39,237
Hey, Kazuki. It's dad. It's your dad!

504
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:08,863
Stay away!

505
01:00:11,507 --> 01:00:12,337
Stay away!

506
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,002
Professor!

507
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:46,505
My son is sick. Where should I take him?

508
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,236
Now is bad.

509
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:50,936
Why?

510
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:55,047
Someone gave birth to a green baby.

511
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,764
You really helped me.

512
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:12,595
Thank you.

513
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:18,902
Asano-kun?

514
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,999
He's sleeping in his room.

515
01:01:23,479 --> 01:01:24,571
I see.

516
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:37,118
Professor?

517
01:01:40,096 --> 01:01:41,529
Can I ask you something?

518
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:44,560
Sure.

519
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,413
Are you really...

520
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,281
Zebraman?

521
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:20,126
It's true.

522
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:30,441
You were in one of my dreams.

523
01:02:35,084 --> 01:02:40,522
You healed a big wound.

524
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,787
I wanted to help you.

525
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,092
It seemed so real.

526
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:56,637
Professor...

527
01:02:59,075 --> 01:02:59,871
Today...

528
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,174
I understood it.

529
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,912
The reason why I fight...

530
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,278
Is for dreams.

531
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:29,528
Not for my dreams, but for...

532
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,002
but for his.

533
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,272
That's what I believe.

534
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:55,523
Kazuki? Are you all right?

535
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,427
Are you okay?

536
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:03,199
He's okay.

537
01:04:56,893 --> 01:05:02,525
I'm sorry for before.

538
01:06:01,357 --> 01:06:02,688
"There's no more time"

539
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:08,160
"I leave the rest up to you"

540
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:14,066
"Anything Goes"

541
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:19,740
Anything goes?

542
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:55,701
Hey, what are you doing?

543
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:57,373
Hey, what are you doing?

544
01:06:59,115 --> 01:07:00,844
I'm looking for Prof. Kyoto.

545
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,313
Here?

546
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:04,108
Yeah, here.

547
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:05,776
I'm there.

548
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:07,917
There?

549
01:07:09,959 --> 01:07:10,516
That's close.

550
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:16,119
During the incident that just passed,

551
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:22,003
There was a striped man who helped save the kids.

552
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,742
I'm trying to find out who he is.

553
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:41,354
Excuse me.

554
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:48,926
What is this?

555
01:07:50,132 --> 01:07:51,861
It's a dump, right?

556
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,932
A real dump.

557
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,170
Is Kyoto okay?

558
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,483
Excuse me.

559
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:37,935
Scripts?

560
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,458
"Car stealing kids"

561
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:55,925
"Crab Man"

562
01:08:56,899 --> 01:08:58,366
"Green Baby"

563
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,715
Zebraman scripts.

564
01:09:15,417 --> 01:09:21,049
What I'm about to tell you is surprising.

565
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:29,788
These scripts contain everything
that's been going on lately.

566
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,628
Crab Man.

567
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,497
Kids stealing cars.

568
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,633
Green baby.

569
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:43,573
Wait a second. I heard nothing about those.

570
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:53,887
But, Prof. Kyoto knew about it all this time.

571
01:10:00,129 --> 01:10:02,097
It's all here.

572
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,298
Prof. Kyoto?

573
01:10:08,437 --> 01:10:09,233
Yes.

574
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:14,072
He must know about Zebraman.

575
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:22,080
Hey, did you ever hear anything
strange from the professor's room?

576
01:10:22,751 --> 01:10:25,588
No, I never did.

577
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:30,821
Too bad. I think Kyoto knows what's going on.

578
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,330
I think Kyoto is in alien hands.

579
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:35,564
Who told you that?

580
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,792
Wait a sec!

581
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:43,329
Find him.

582
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:45,097
Yes.

583
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:57,719
In Yokohama, 34 years ago, a UFO crash-landed.

584
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:12,895
The aliens mixed in with humans around
the area of the junior high school.

585
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:24,135
Soon after, the alien's began using
the Zebraman scripts for their plans.

586
01:11:26,081 --> 01:11:29,710
The program was cancelled early.

587
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:45,259
The UFO aliens used the junior
high school to further their plans.

588
01:11:47,536 --> 01:11:53,065
They began to further experiment on humans.

589
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:59,913
Prof. Kyoto began a one man fight against the aliens.

590
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:07,582
That's why he wanted to transfer
the students to another school.

591
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:13,795
He said...

592
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:16,625
What?

593
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:19,127
Anything goes.

594
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:25,338
He believed...

595
01:12:26,975 --> 01:12:28,602
Dreams come true.

596
01:12:52,101 --> 01:13:03,103
Kyoto is an alien. But not just a normal
alien. He's an original alien from the UFO.

597
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:07,940
Hey.

598
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:09,309
Yes?

599
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:21,421
We can't let you interfere with
our plans for invasion...

600
01:13:57,332 --> 01:13:58,230
Seigawa...

601
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,602
Seigawa-san is dead.

602
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,854
I need a bike.

603
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,390
I should have a bike.

604
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:13,540
Heroes always have bikes.

605
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:28,585
Sorry.

606
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,232
Kazuki...

607
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:21,373
Your father...

608
01:16:24,379 --> 01:16:26,108
Needs to fly to the sky...

609
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:46,923
Sorry.

610
01:16:53,709 --> 01:16:54,607
Your mother...

611
01:16:57,179 --> 01:16:58,077
And sister...

612
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,345
Take care of them.

613
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:14,719
Dad...

614
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:31,338
Do your best.

615
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:12,504
Did you read the script for the final episode?

616
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:14,409
No.

617
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,884
How about Asano-kun?

618
01:19:19,821 --> 01:19:22,415
He didn't read it either.

619
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:27,252
That's good.

620
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,698
I don't think I can fly.

621
01:19:45,046 --> 01:19:49,745
When fighting the alien boss,

622
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:54,287
Zebraman

623
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:58,690
Gets defeated.

624
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:03,424
But then...

625
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:08,459
What happens?

626
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:13,535
Zebraman...

627
01:20:17,145 --> 01:20:18,976
Flies into the sky.

628
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,515
Then he...

629
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:30,551
saves the earth and humanity...

630
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:35,190
From the alien invasion.

631
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,699
That's the final episode.

632
01:20:46,908 --> 01:20:48,876
What the heck is that?

633
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:54,973
Who would watch such a show?

634
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,384
You've been practicing flying?

635
01:21:01,957 --> 01:21:02,446
Yes.

636
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:04,321
How long?

637
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,157
10 days.

638
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,405
I think to fly...

639
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,576
is impossible.

640
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,916
I wish I never read that script!

641
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:50,065
My son believes in you.

642
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:57,144
He believes that Zebraman will protect the earth.

643
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:02,809
For my son's sake...

644
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:06,912
please...

645
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,320
learn how to fly!

646
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:29,741
Miss...

647
01:22:31,346 --> 01:22:32,472
Yes.

648
01:22:36,418 --> 01:22:37,510
Did you...

649
01:22:39,654 --> 01:22:40,985
understand my story?

650
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:45,724
Yes.

651
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:58,338
There is one man who can help.

652
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:00,673
Who is it?

653
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:03,605
It's Zebraman.

654
01:23:06,481 --> 01:23:07,505
It's Zebraman!

655
01:23:08,783 --> 01:23:11,911
You mean that striped guy?

656
01:23:13,221 --> 01:23:16,850
Sounds weird, doesn't it?

657
01:23:17,759 --> 01:23:25,791
But I think he's the only one who can help us.

658
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:27,598
No need.

659
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:34,200
The order has been given.

660
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:40,838
Tonight, the Junior High School will be no more.

661
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,243
Our operation will be over.

662
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:52,927
In a moment, the school will cease to exist.

663
01:23:56,031 --> 01:24:00,491
I expect your support.

664
01:24:12,313 --> 01:24:14,281
How can you say that?

665
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:16,610
Everyone has gone crazy.

666
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:22,087
It's all we can do to survive.

667
01:24:43,144 --> 01:24:44,475
Dad...

668
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,408
Do your best.

669
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:53,944
He believes.

670
01:24:56,191 --> 01:24:58,056
Believes in dreams.

671
01:25:03,331 --> 01:25:09,099
Believe in dreams, believe in dreams.

672
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:06,361
Why did you come here? If
something bad happened tell me...

673
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,262
No, no. I had something important to tell you.

674
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:14,628
You should not give up.

675
01:26:18,439 --> 01:26:28,906
I really believe that you are a
big hero, defending the earth.

676
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:39,559
You look terrible.

677
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:46,592
Well, I'm sorry for saying such weird things.

678
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,329
Later.

679
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,168
Take care.

680
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:08,005
Shinpei?

681
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:11,382
Where are you, Shinpei?

682
01:28:14,055 --> 01:28:15,352
Toilet?

683
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,988
Shinpei!

684
01:28:53,594 --> 01:28:55,357
Please stop, please stop.

685
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,365
What is it?

686
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,560
We're sorry, but the road is closed.

687
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,369
Why?

688
01:29:01,369 --> 01:29:02,893
We're sorry, no one can pass.

689
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:06,067
But my son went to the school...

690
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:12,070
Everything is in order here.

691
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:46,039
Please! I need to go to the school!

692
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:39,059
You're good, Professor.

693
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:44,095
Clear a path.

694
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:46,630
Open it, open it.

695
01:31:07,061 --> 01:31:13,227
Let's go. To the school. Get on.

696
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:14,292
Yes.

697
01:32:13,861 --> 01:32:15,089
Asano-san.

698
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:24,563
Zebraman.

699
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:28,869
Help me, Zebraman!

700
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,682
Do your best, Zebraman!

701
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:50,271
Great!

702
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:29,943
Zebraman, look out!

703
01:36:33,988 --> 01:36:35,512
You're not gonna...

704
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:37,316
keep me down.

705
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:14,653
Hey? What's going on?

706
01:37:14,895 --> 01:37:15,589
Kazuki!

707
01:37:15,729 --> 01:37:16,559
What?

708
01:37:56,437 --> 01:37:59,133
Now what?

709
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:06,404
There's only 3 minutes left until the
chopper gets here! Let's clear out!

710
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:10,017
Shinpei!

711
01:38:10,017 --> 01:38:11,245
Shinpei?

712
01:38:54,194 --> 01:38:54,990
Shinpei!

713
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:42,340
What now?

714
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:43,908
Fly.

715
01:39:46,246 --> 01:39:48,737
Zebraman, fly and fight.

716
01:39:52,252 --> 01:39:53,150
Asano-san.

717
01:39:53,921 --> 01:39:55,980
Zebraman has to fly.

718
01:39:56,357 --> 01:39:58,222
Zebraman has to fly to the sky.

719
01:40:01,495 --> 01:40:05,261
You have to believe that you can fly.

720
01:40:58,719 --> 01:40:59,947
Asano-san...

721
01:41:03,657 --> 01:41:04,589
See.

722
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:10,556
Now it's Zebraman's turn.

723
01:41:37,224 --> 01:41:38,657
Zebraman!

724
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:41,820
Fly!

725
01:41:57,311 --> 01:41:58,579
Shinpei!

726
01:41:58,579 --> 01:41:59,477
Shinpei!

727
01:42:24,338 --> 01:42:25,134
He flew.

728
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,046
Shinpei!

729
01:42:48,962 --> 01:42:50,190
Thank you...

730
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,423
Zebraman.

731
01:46:34,488 --> 01:46:35,819
Hey...

732
01:46:36,556 --> 01:46:38,319
Can I ask you something?

733
01:46:39,526 --> 01:46:40,424
What?

734
01:46:41,528 --> 01:46:43,689
My mask...

735
01:46:44,998 --> 01:46:48,525
I was finally having some fun.

736
01:46:49,102 --> 01:46:54,734
Yes, yes. Everything is fine now.

737
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:59,044
Japan is safe!

738
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:07,550
We're here.

739
01:47:21,902 --> 01:47:23,665
Here.

740
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:34,275
Everyone is waiting for Zebraman.

741
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:36,076
He looks like a fine man.

742
01:48:36,076 --> 01:48:38,044
He doesn't look like dad?

743
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:40,237
No way! Don't say such a thing!

744
01:49:20,353 --> 01:49:22,082
Thank you, Zebraman!

745
01:50:09,803 --> 01:50:10,997
Turn on the black and white.
