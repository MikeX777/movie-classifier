00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:35,452
Animals with The Tollkeeper

2
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,182
It has been almost three years, 

3
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,095
Since I first heard the 
story of the tollkeeper.

4
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,486
At first, the tale seemed 
too unimaginable to be true.

5
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,466
But as I heard more and more rumours 
of this contemporary phenomenon,

6
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:09,702
the myth became a
 source of great intrigue.

7
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,924
Finding the exact location of this man

8
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,531
required true detective work. 

9
00:01:17,302 --> 00:01:20,773
But after months of trekking
 the deserts of Southern Utah,

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,093
We have found our quarry.

11
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,544
Hello!

12
00:01:57,304 --> 00:02:00,897
I am a film-maker. 
Interested in talking with you. 

13
00:02:04,824 --> 00:02:07,122
I would like to talk to you on film. 

14
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:10,524
Are you gonna go on?

15
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,288
No. We came to talk with you. 

16
00:02:15,097 --> 00:02:16,811
Go on, Fillmore. Go inside. 

17
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:18,295
<i>An unexpected snag. </i>

18
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,128
<i>Our subject appears to be apprehensive. </i>

19
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:26,201
<i>This first day was not so successful. </i>

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,488
<i>This man has shown a 
strange resistance to us. </i>

21
00:02:31,288 --> 00:02:33,877
<i>Our concerns have now
 turned to the weather. </i>

22
00:02:34,515 --> 00:02:38,220
<i>A storm is on the way. 
We must prepare for its arrival. </i>

23
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:43,150
<i>We shall stay in the truck, 
except for Henri, our sound-man,</i>

24
00:02:43,424 --> 00:02:46,944
<i>who has volunteered to stay 
in a small tent with a camera. </i>

25
00:02:47,473 --> 00:02:51,562
<i>Felipe thinks Henri is insane. I agree. </i>

26
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,113
<i>We are happy to see Henri.</i>

27
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,735
<i>We are happy that we have survived
 the brutality of the desert night. </i>

28
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,375
<i>But now, we must get back to work. </i>

29
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:29,560
Please!

30
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,266
I have searched for 
you for three years. 

31
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,622
Give me one minute of time. 

32
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,837
We have run into an immovable object. 

33
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,575
We must try an unorthodox approach. 

34
00:03:47,313 --> 00:03:48,664
Look at Felipe!

35
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,362
Look, what he can do!

36
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,708
Look at us!

37
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,622
Isn't this amazing. Come on.

38
00:04:03,646 --> 00:04:05,975
You can stand on Felipe's stomach. 

39
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,631
<i>Felipe's years in the
 circus have paid off. </i>

40
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,609
<i>At long last, we have made a friend. </i>

41
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:45,340
This is the toll-gate. 

42
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,313
What is wrong?

43
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,128
I feel kinda naked without my tuba. 

44
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,308
This is the toll-gate. 

45
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,402
It's the most essential part 
of the toll-gathering mechanism. 

46
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,820
<i>On this day, we were treated
 to a feast of prairie dog, </i>

47
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,513
<i>cactus wine, and what looked 
like the meat from a small bird. </i>

48
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:12,840
<i>His initial unwillingness to talk to us, </i>

49
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,695
<i>seems a distant memory. </i>

50
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:19,017
<i>Now we could not keep 
him quiet if we tried. </i>

51
00:05:20,968 --> 00:05:22,222
When I was a young man, 

52
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:26,773
I played third horn in 
the Milbert and Gilmore

53
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,804
all-marching band, out in San Francisco.

54
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,920
I love playing the horn. 

55
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:36,666
But I didn't play too good. 
Not for the marching band. 

56
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,724
I play good enough for out here. 

57
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,635
One day after we gave
 a real bad performance, 

58
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:48,040
I got an idea. It was 
gonna be a gold-rush town. 

59
00:05:48,168 --> 00:05:51,600
It sprang up from nowhere, 
about 50 miles to my right down here. 

60
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:55,315
And another gold-rush 
town spring up to my left. 

61
00:05:56,744 --> 00:05:59,528
And it only made sense that 
people were gonna go back and forth. 

62
00:06:01,146 --> 00:06:04,964
So I said, 'If I put a toll-gate
 between the two, I could make a fortune!'

63
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:09,955
So I packed my wagon up. 

64
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,702
Here I am!

65
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,575
As time went on, my horse died, two towns died.  

66
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,102
But I still have a feeling

67
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,181
that someday somebody's
 gonna build a big road

68
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,626
right through here. 

69
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,275
It's just a matter of time. 

70
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,725
Has anyone ever passed 
through your toll-booth?

71
00:06:40,306 --> 00:06:41,133
No, not yet. 

72
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,395
You have been here fifty years?

73
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,413
Yes, that's right. 

74
00:07:02,942 --> 00:07:06,102
The second and most 
important part of this toll operation,

75
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:09,653
Is this coin-deposit facility. 

76
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:21,944
Filmore came to me eight years 
ago. Just wondered up one day. 

77
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,153
Never taught him to 
dance. He just does it. 

78
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,966
<i>When he sleeps, the toll-keeper's 
dreams are filled with effigies of romance </i>

79
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,066
<i>he could only only in the
 silence of a desert night. </i>

80
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,848
<i>This morning's sunrise was 
accompanied by a strange humming 
sound coming from the distant horizon.</i>

81
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:03,082
<i>A spectacular event will occur. 
After fifty years of waiting,</i>

82
00:08:03,304 --> 00:08:06,630
<i>an automobile will pass 
through the toll-keeper's gate. </i>

83
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:08,744
<i>Preparations have begun. </i>

84
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,058
I see it! L'arrive!

85
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,066
Gotta get it ready for the next 
folks that come by. There'll be others. 

86
00:10:54,473 --> 00:10:58,957
Too many broken people 
today. No place to go.

87
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,073
No hope.

88
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:09,330
So they'll come to
 me because I'll be waiting for 
them. with my tuba, and they'll stop. 

89
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:15,855
They'll stop at my gate and
 they'll be still like the wind. 

90
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,902
And they'll hear my music.

91
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,153
That'll fix them. 

92
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,057
And it'll only cost them a nickel. 

93
00:11:37,188 --> 00:11:40,542
This day we said goodbye
 to our strange new friend. 

94
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,137
Whether our expedition was 
successful, I do not know but

95
00:11:45,595 --> 00:11:46,895
I am satisfied. 

96
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:51,795
Today, I feel less a film-maker 
than an archaeologist.

97
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:55,946
Who has stumbled across
 a rare but fragile relic. 

98
00:11:56,482 --> 00:12:01,715
who marvelled at its beauty 
momentarily, and must walk softly away. 

99
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:03,566
leaving no footprints. 

100
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:09,595
Henry, can you hear me?

101
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:16,104
Where are you, Henry? 
Where are you?

102
00:13:33,393 --> 00:13:37,840
Out of sorrow we walk in 
the language of a dream.

103
00:13:39,084 --> 00:13:40,483
You must have heard it somewhere?

104
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,326
Stuck in his head and it
 rolls around and around. 

105
00:13:45,055 --> 00:13:49,857
I hate to rush you, but I've 
been half a fart behind all day. 

106
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,177
Where are you going again? 

107
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:56,206
Under the bridge, where all the 
old Mafia dudes used to hang out. 

108
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,975
You think he's an idiot, don't you?

109
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,651
You're not one of those guys that's

110
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,810
that's gonna yap the whole time,
 are you? 'Cus I don't like yappers. 

111
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,886
No, I'm not like that, I keep to
 myself. You happen to bug me too. 

112
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:14,810
It's a popular misconception, 
the idiot thing. 

113
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,355
He butchers his
 words, but they're always well 
chosen. He's clean, compulsively

114
00:14:19,357 --> 00:14:20,377
Show him your nails, friend. 

115
00:14:29,055 --> 00:14:30,395
That was a close shave. 

116
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,124
Sorry. 

117
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,666
You're in your own little 
world today, aren't you?

118
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:38,540
Got your own little symbiosis 
going with yourself. 

119
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,795
Talk to your friend, will you?

120
00:14:40,366 --> 00:14:42,642
He's got his own little world, himself. 

121
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,697
Smiles all the time. 

122
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,266
Even at his mother's 
funeral, he smiled. 

123
00:14:50,002 --> 00:14:51,371
Must be a nice life.

124
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:55,962
Easy navigation for perpetual bliss. 

125
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,764
7-25

126
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:17,008
Imagine a guy like 
you with a guy like me. 

127
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,980
ending up alone together 
under a bridge like this. 

128
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,522
Pretty romantic, huh?

129
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,891
Necessity makes strange bedfellows. 

130
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:32,025
All lovey-dovey. I'm afraid 
I'm gonna have to ask you 

131
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:34,517
In the parlance of the tough-guy world

132
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,326
To stick 'em up.  

133
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,311
This is perfect. 

134
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,988
You don't know how perfect this is. 

135
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,133
You're a real son of a 
bitch, you know that?

136
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,911
but you come at me 
just at the right time. 

137
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,175
Don't blame me. I'm not inventing this
 kind of thing, I'm just part of a trend. 

138
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,084
This can't be your first time. 

139
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,746
Part of the job. 

140
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,100
Still, kind of makes your colon twitch. 

141
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,831
To tell you the truth

142
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,675
I don't feel a thing. 

143
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:23,788
Nothing. 

144
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,357
I'm numb. 

145
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,028
You know, I prefer to do 
this with a sense of poetry. 

146
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,046
If I had to shoot you,
 I'd feel real sad. 

147
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,413
Go ahead, blast away. 
Who's stopping you?

148
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,463
It's a real gun. It has 
bullets and everything. 

149
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:53,434
I'm afraid the prognosis 
of you surviving with this 
attitude of yours is fairly remote. 

150
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:56,024
You're making a very
 unfortunate choice. 

151
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,509
The last fellow who resisted

152
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,268
now suffers from a 
severe lack of breath. 

153
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,333
It's not a matter of resisting.
 I want you to shoot me. 

154
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,902
Go ahead!

155
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,540
Do it!

156
00:17:11,762 --> 00:17:14,575
I don't give a fuck anymore. I don't
 wanna be part of your world anymore. 

157
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:21,333
There's no future in nobility.

158
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:44,617
You're going to die for $23?

159
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,660
My friend, I'm not one 
to judge another man's bible

160
00:17:48,682 --> 00:17:51,897
but I'm afraid your
 brains aren't all in a row. 

161
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,562
I'm sorry I had to take your money. 
You seem like a nice guy. 

162
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,420
but I couldn't sleep at 
night knowing I let it slip by. 

163
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,162
It's just the beast of the nature. 

164
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,873
Are you mad at me?

165
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:50,084
Bonjour!

166
00:19:50,702 --> 00:19:52,748
Thank the Lord we found you!

167
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,064
Hit the road, I'm not in the mood. 

168
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:03,164
This address. 

169
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,575
I'm not gonna take you
 anywhere, so just get out. 

170
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,104
I don't think it's too far away. 

171
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,277
Look, you see this vein? 

172
00:20:09,424 --> 00:20:11,471
 It's about to explode
 like a fucking geyser. 

173
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:21,610
I'm this far away from committing
 acts of extreme violence!

174
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,017
I can't be responsible for my actions. 

175
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,204
Perfect! You are a man of adventure. 

176
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,868
Our bags are over there, merci. 

177
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,244
We are going to surprise a 
friend we haven't seen in some time. 

178
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:57,888
Herve Breton.

179
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,155
Hey, what's with those two? 
They're giving me the creeps.

180
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:05,755
Just act natural. They're 
students of anthropology. 

181
00:21:07,691 --> 00:21:09,262
You have a nice picture.

182
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:10,962
Henry!

183
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,044
You have the same
name as my friend here.

184
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:19,024
Look, in this country we don't
 talk to people we don't know. 

185
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,717
It's dangerous. We're
 a dangerous people. 

186
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,162
Unfortunately, he's deaf. 

187
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,350
I am Laurent and he is Felipe.

188
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,348
We spent most of our lives 
together, along with Henri

189
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,380
making documentary films.

190
00:21:34,062 --> 00:21:37,802
Now that we are coming to
 end of our journey in this world 

191
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,962
We want to be together 
again, for the last time. 

192
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:44,942
Look, buddy. I'll take you
 where you're going, but no yapping.

193
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:46,200
You got that?

194
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:48,102
I got this.  

195
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,475
This is us in 1933. Utah. Magical.

196
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,206
In the desert, when it is so
 quiet that the wind seems to shout 

197
00:22:06,642 --> 00:22:09,502
one can hear the earth-conscience. 

198
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,333
In such a place, anything is possible. 

199
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,291
This is where I saw my 
first glimpse of paradise. 

200
00:22:28,088 --> 00:22:32,564
Not in my heart and 
mind, but in my eyes. 

201
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,426
I shock you?

202
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,357
I'm a cab driver, every 
unemployed sideshow freak

203
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:41,337
and festering dreamer has crawled 
through that door one time or another. 

204
00:22:41,342 --> 00:22:42,395
It's nothing personal.

205
00:22:42,631 --> 00:22:44,964
Half my life is spent 
with wackos like you. 

206
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,462
So you know everything? 

207
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:49,771
Enough. Enough to know 
what is and what isn't.

208
00:22:49,773 --> 00:22:51,900
One man's cesspool is 
another man's paradise. 

209
00:22:51,915 --> 00:22:53,760
But to me, it all smells the same. 

210
00:22:53,831 --> 00:22:59,062
Let me tell you something, Henry.
A cynic is the architect of his own abyss.

211
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,768
It takes nothing to be a misanthrope.

212
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,368
But to devour life with 
all it's seeds takes courage. 

213
00:23:14,991 --> 00:23:16,450
I feel terrible, Henry. 

214
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:20,786
In all the excitement, we have
 forgotten to exchange our currency.

215
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,194
Yeah, well you're lucky 
I had some spare cash. 

216
00:23:25,131 --> 00:23:29,100
When we find your friend I 
want my money. I'm no schmuck. 

217
00:23:29,568 --> 00:23:31,600
Last guy that tried something like this

218
00:23:31,731 --> 00:23:33,802
now suffers from a 
severe lack of breath.

219
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,495
- We are men of honour! 
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

220
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,786
Do you like driving a taxi?

221
00:23:40,937 --> 00:23:41,617
Pays the rent. 

222
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,797
What do you do at night?

223
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:47,090
I drive. I usually
 don't pick anybody up. 

224
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,324
Just drive around in circles
 until the sun comes up. 

225
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,402
You have a girl?

226
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,133
You know, we got an 
expression in this country

227
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,117
'Curiosity killed the cat'.

228
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:56,796
So you prefer the man?

229
00:23:58,008 --> 00:23:59,657
I don't go for that other stuff. 

230
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,898
I got plenty of women. I got more 
women than I know what to do with. 

231
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,374
I think you have nobody. 
This is no good.

232
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,513
You must find a companion. 

233
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,853
You know, Laurent, you seem
 like an alright guy to me, really. 

234
00:24:13,295 --> 00:24:16,315
You know, but I don't like 
people trying to run my life. 

235
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:21,548
Nothing personal, but to me you're
 nothing more than $62 and some change. 

236
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:27,328
Don't worry, Henry. I'm willing 
you a heart full of romance. 

237
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:28,535
Thank you. You do that. 

238
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,833
Tell me the truth. 

239
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,202
When you saw me 
carrying on like that back there 

240
00:24:39,217 --> 00:24:41,226
What did you think? You must
 have thought I was crazy, right?

241
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:46,050
Felipe suspected you were 
an imbecile, but I saw a soul who had 

242
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,951
the suffering of a condemned man. 

243
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,622
Oh, Maryland, The pine tree state!

244
00:25:02,697 --> 00:25:04,422
I'm afraid we must stop again. 

245
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,286
We've been stopping every ten minutes. 

246
00:25:07,395 --> 00:25:11,170
We're nearly one 
hundred years old, Henry. 

247
00:25:11,673 --> 00:25:14,770
I mean, come on. So we pee a lot. 

248
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,651
Alright, we find a place to 
stop and everybody pees together. 

249
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,104
He says he's dry. 

250
00:25:39,031 --> 00:25:39,766
Everybody!

251
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:48,168
You see! He's completely dry. 

252
00:26:07,517 --> 00:26:11,180
I'm afraid it's time for Felipe's nap. 

253
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,303
- He's a man of strict regiment. - No.

254
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:14,628
Just one hour. 

255
00:26:15,597 --> 00:26:18,635
One hour! I promise, I cross my heart. 

256
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,262
You're a very kind man, Henry. 
Not an imbecile at all. 

257
00:26:34,466 --> 00:26:36,350
<i>The subject sleeps peacefully</i>

258
00:26:36,482 --> 00:26:40,220
<i>as rays of the afternoon light warm him.</i>

259
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,257
<i>What thoughts occupy his slumber?</i>

260
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,326
<i>What memories does
 he conjure up and relive?</i>

261
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:52,436
<i>Do the endings change
 or remain the same?</i>

262
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:54,648
What are you doing?

263
00:26:56,926 --> 00:26:59,046
Don't do that. Don't do that. 

264
00:27:00,651 --> 00:27:02,380
<i>The subject grows hostile. </i>

265
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,397
<i>His unpredictable nature
 presents a danger to us. </i>

266
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,315
<i>Such is the risk of 
shooting in the wild. </i>

267
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,220
It's a good day to be alive. 

268
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:20,835
Get in the fucking car. 

269
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,822
Pardon me for saying, Henry

270
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,351
I think you're being 
a bit of a tight-ass.

271
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,726
I imagine it squeak when you 
make the fart. No, I know your kind. 

272
00:27:56,217 --> 00:28:00,197
You hold it inside. The pressure builds.

273
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,464
You become a raging furnace. 

274
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:06,980
This is not good for the 
disposition. Go on, free yourself!

275
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,410
Present your case to the world.

276
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,726
Make with the fart. 

277
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,764
Where do you get these ideas?

278
00:28:16,302 --> 00:28:16,808
Here!

279
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,697
So, what is the big deal?

280
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,835
Now your turn. 

281
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:29,060
You don't ask a complete
 stranger to fart, Laurent. 

282
00:28:29,226 --> 00:28:31,831
Please, Henry. Just the littlest one. 

283
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,204
You're a very disturbed man. 

284
00:28:34,224 --> 00:28:38,470
Come on, amuse me.
 What weird, it just a little wind.

285
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,819
Unbelievable. 

286
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,402
Can't. Not when you're
 looking at me like that. 

287
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:07,313
Go ahead. You do not
 even exist in my mind. 

288
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,411
Sensational! The best 
one I heard in years. 

289
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:20,786
Who are you people anyway?

290
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,680
We are crusaders of the heart. 

291
00:29:22,946 --> 00:29:25,020
Conquerors of the impossible.

292
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:29,162
We carve in stone the
 heartbeat of the imaginary.

293
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:34,832
Left! Turn left!

294
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,011
Henri will die soon. He has emphysema.

295
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,546
I was hoping that you
 may let him drive a little.

296
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,842
Are you kidding me?

297
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:46,362
You'd make him feel like man again.

298
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:46,448
He can't even see over the wheel. 
You'd make him feel like man again.

299
00:29:46,448 --> 00:29:47,808
He can't even see over the wheel. 

300
00:29:48,306 --> 00:29:53,244
Do this one favour and I will 
personally reserve you a seat in heaven. 

301
00:29:53,246 --> 00:29:54,750
Absolutely not. 

302
00:30:13,071 --> 00:30:13,940
Watch out for the dog!

303
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,600
Break!

304
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:39,113
I'm afraid

305
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,246
He's no good. 

306
00:30:43,153 --> 00:30:44,191
Do you have a crowbar?

307
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:11,637
Is he OK?

308
00:31:13,035 --> 00:31:15,637
He's doing a dance to honour the dog. 

309
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,717
It reminds him of a 
dog we once knew in Utah. 

310
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:25,933
Sometime it's easy to
 get lost in the past. 

311
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,340
You know, I don't 
remember having a past. 

312
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,324
There must be something you remember. 

313
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,602
It was a vision, not a dream. 

314
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,253
This was real. 

315
00:31:47,817 --> 00:31:50,673
I used to climb this mountain. 

316
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,793
It's peak was so high, 
it went through the clouds

317
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,044
It was silent up there. 

318
00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:00,362
It was still. It was like a threshold

319
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,180
into another world. A world of grace. 

320
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,268
It was barely out of sight. 

321
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,822
I knew that I could fly out there. 
It was an amazing feeling. 

322
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,015
A feeling of peace, freedom.  

323
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:18,860
I would always resist. 

324
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,922
I always regretted 
not taking that chance. 

325
00:32:28,422 --> 00:32:29,373
But it was real. 

326
00:32:33,497 --> 00:32:34,211
It was real. 

327
00:33:16,637 --> 00:33:19,702
A perfectly ordinary man 
goes to sleep one night. 

328
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:22,968
He has normal dreams. 

329
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:27,262
The one he rehearses 
time and time again. 

330
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,211
Everything is well. 

331
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,442
The next morning, he wakes shattered. 

332
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:37,395
During the darkest hours of the night

333
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:41,064
something has performed 
a vivisection on his soul.

334
00:33:41,746 --> 00:33:44,113
A sudden disillusionment. 

335
00:33:44,208 --> 00:33:47,415
An unexplainable sense of betrayal. 

336
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:52,086
The fantasies of youth petrify. 

337
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,811
He falls way from 
the rest of the world. 

338
00:33:57,042 --> 00:34:01,264
His pure heart begins to mortify.

339
00:34:04,122 --> 00:34:05,006
What does he do?

340
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:09,300
Mend his ruptured spirit. 

341
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,013
How?

342
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:15,622
With nature. With the love of another. 

343
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:21,773
Together, they will unveil
 the ancient mysteries

344
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:25,093
that continue to haunt us all. 

345
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:30,275
The way only lovers can. 

346
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,067
You make it sound so easy. 

347
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:42,506
Embrace the struggle, Henry. 

348
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,047
I let you know a secret. 

349
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:52,002
The world is filled with
 magic. It is all around. 

350
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,864
You just have to believe in it. 

351
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,984
Are you an angel?

352
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:09,997
I'm only a man, but I am a friend. 

353
00:35:58,842 --> 00:36:01,773
I cannot say it was 
completely unexpected. 

354
00:36:03,844 --> 00:36:05,840
You must continue alone.

355
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,637
I can't just leave you
 in the middle of nowhere

356
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,913
It is the way it must be, Henry. 

357
00:36:13,646 --> 00:36:17,131
Felipe and I will 
continue our own journey. 

358
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,755
Our final adventure. 

359
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:24,622
Perhaps, the greatest of all. 

360
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,668
Can I come with you?

361
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,068
You have your own ??? to begin. 

362
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:36,418
Follow this road. It will
 take you to your destiny. 

363
00:36:36,575 --> 00:36:40,311
Someone to love. 
Do not let her pass by. 

364
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,495
Together

365
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,777
You will find the 
beginning of his creation. 

366
00:36:49,388 --> 00:36:51,202
I feel very strange. 

367
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,995
You are now a crusader.

368
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:56,331
Trust your heart. 
Believe in the impossible. 

369
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:59,406
Strange things sometimes happen, no?

370
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,875
So this is paradise.

371
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:37,499
Please stop!

372
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:39,960
Who are you?

373
00:40:41,011 --> 00:40:42,622
I need to talk to you.

374
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:27,642
Essie, you come here. Give me that. 

375
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,371
Give it. I'll kill you!

376
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,790
You can't kill me if you don't have it. 

377
00:41:31,797 --> 00:41:33,650
Give it, give it to me. 

378
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:36,002
Don't steal a man's honour. 

379
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,184
Dumb little ass. 

380
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:04,693
Bastard!

381
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,764
You all right?

382
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:14,773
I'm alright. 

383
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,215
You want me to take you somewhere?

384
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:21,564
No, I'm married to 
that son of a bitch. I'll stay. 

385
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,622
Essie!

386
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:24,530
Coming!

387
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,031
- Get your ass in here!  - I'm coming!

388
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,486
You ain't got no class, woman. 

389
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:29,053
You ass cancer.

390
00:43:27,388 --> 00:43:30,830
He's gonna die, at 
least that's what he says. 

391
00:43:31,353 --> 00:43:35,466
His family got a 
knack for knowing when their 
time's up, and he says it's now. 

392
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:36,682
Where's he going?

393
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,782
This is the cemetery, we 
don't keep no rubble around here. 

394
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,813
We usually bury the dead 
naked in a fistful of birch seeds. 

395
00:43:44,924 --> 00:43:47,650
Except for if they're
 coloured, then it's acorns. 

396
00:43:48,171 --> 00:43:50,768
These trees is all headstones. 

397
00:43:52,848 --> 00:43:56,237
About this woman? She left this behind.

398
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:58,960
Fatima Chu. 

399
00:43:59,893 --> 00:44:04,000
She works the graveyard shift over
 at the yarn factory. Pisspot knows her. 

400
00:44:04,162 --> 00:44:07,082
Hey get a move on, 
old man. I ain't got all day. 

401
00:44:07,388 --> 00:44:08,555
- You know where she lives?
 - Here I am, Lord!

402
00:44:09,268 --> 00:44:10,708
I don't know what you want with me.

403
00:44:11,766 --> 00:44:13,942
It's gotta be crowded up there by now. 

404
00:44:13,946 --> 00:44:16,073
Man's got the heart of a lion. 

405
00:44:17,651 --> 00:44:20,673
Might as well sit down. 
This could take a while. 

406
00:44:20,958 --> 00:44:24,359
Will you just let me stay 
down here a little longer?

407
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,448
We hadn't heard from him in a while.

408
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,495
You dead yet?

409
00:44:31,715 --> 00:44:32,842
I'm working on it. 

410
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:36,566
Well, hurry up. It's getting chilly. 

411
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,068
Is it always like this between you two?

412
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:44,455
Pretty much, except for the dying part. 

413
00:44:47,911 --> 00:44:48,848
Why do you stay together?

414
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,531
Guess we just a 
couple of crazy romantics. 

415
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:57,382
We're supposed to be going to Miami.

416
00:44:57,388 --> 00:44:59,937
He's got this big plan
 to become a bell-hop.

417
00:45:00,746 --> 00:45:03,820
He sold everything off. 
Got us all packed up. 

418
00:45:04,846 --> 00:45:06,540
We've been in the waiting mode.

419
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:09,524
For how long?

420
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,046
25 years. 

421
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,500
But, tomorrow is the first 
day of the rest of your life, right?

422
00:45:16,502 --> 00:45:17,782
How about now, pisser?

423
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,277
I'm still here. 

424
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,444
Tell me about Fatima.

425
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,311
Keeps to herself.

426
00:45:32,211 --> 00:45:35,126
Thinks she's too good for everybody else. 

427
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,331
Even though she barely owns
 the filth in between her toes. 

428
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:40,755
Listen

429
00:45:42,328 --> 00:45:45,866
If he dies, you want to stick around?

430
00:45:48,166 --> 00:45:50,775
I don't like being by
 myself. I can't stand it. 

431
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:57,475
Nah. 

432
00:46:00,686 --> 00:46:03,906
Wouldn't be right, with us

433
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,293
watching him like this. 

434
00:46:06,953 --> 00:46:09,097
Only said it to piss him off anyway. 

435
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:17,648
She married?

436
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,742
Fatima? Who'd have her.

437
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:24,460
I don't know why you'd want to 
waste your time with a woman like that. 

438
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:29,086
You ever looked into a stranger's eyes

439
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:30,860
And knew you were
 destined to be together?

440
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:36,837
Felt the whole world 
changed in that very instance.

441
00:46:37,348 --> 00:46:39,868
And your heart fill 
with uncontrollable force.

442
00:46:41,810 --> 00:46:46,235
And somehow you knew 
that together you could go 
places you only dreamed of. 

443
00:46:48,237 --> 00:46:52,215
Yeah, once. He's laying
 in that hole over there. 

444
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:43,417
Well, you've got a sense of humour, 
God. A hell of a sense of humour. 

445
00:47:48,417 --> 00:47:51,400
Just a minute! Thank you. 

446
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:57,100
Take the sword. Take the sword. 

447
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:05,245
There's an old pig shack down by 
the river by Fatima's mommas house.

448
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:08,835
There ain't nobody using it. Just 
keep an eye out for her little brother. 

449
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:12,977
Boy's afflicted with schisms. 
Got the curse on him. 

450
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:26,737
Anybody here?

451
00:48:42,371 --> 00:48:43,426
<i>In the beginning. </i>

452
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:46,762
<i>God created the heavens and the earth. </i>

453
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,595
<i>The earth was without form and void.</i>

454
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,651
<i>And darkness was 
upon the face of the deep. </i>

455
00:48:55,062 --> 00:48:58,200
<i>And the spirit of God was 
moving over the face of the waters. </i>

456
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,477
And God said, 'Let there be light!'

457
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,017
And there was light. 

458
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,804
Easy does it now. 

459
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,255
Take it easy now. 

460
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,760
Wait!

461
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:27,031
I'm not a nut, I'm from New York.

462
00:50:27,537 --> 00:50:29,286
I just wanna talk to you.

463
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,611
There's really no reason to be afraid. 

464
00:51:02,611 --> 00:51:04,217
We're supposed to be together.

465
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:08,724
I think you know that too. 

466
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:15,073
I saw it in your eyes, yesterday. 

467
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:23,188
I think you've been waiting for me, 
just like I've been waiting for you. 

468
00:51:32,475 --> 00:51:35,355
At first, I didn't think you were real. 

469
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,653
But when you left 
that yarn for me to find. 

470
00:51:42,175 --> 00:51:44,040
You knew I wasn't going crazy. 

471
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,215
I think you should come with me.

472
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,688
The boy said you were 
with a man this morning. 

473
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,195
He's lying again. I wasn't with nobody. 

474
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:10,140
I don't don't want you ever

475
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,511
talking to a man. 

476
00:53:13,473 --> 00:53:15,215
Ever. You hear me?

477
00:53:15,668 --> 00:53:16,593
Yes, mama. 

478
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,526
What's heaven like?

479
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:39,151
White. Silent. 

480
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:42,222
A place where people's 
tongues are tied in knots. 

481
00:53:42,231 --> 00:53:43,560
What's hell like?

482
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,386
Boiling, with huge piles
 of shit everywhere.

483
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:50,782
Now, go home sweetie. I mean it.

484
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:15,153
I see a black swan

485
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,972
that eats nothing but pearls. 

486
00:55:19,744 --> 00:55:25,180
I see a dead fat lady on her
 back, with her legs in the air. 

487
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:29,142
Tell me where I come from again.

488
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,493
The one where you come out of 
a fire I burned for seven years?

489
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:39,271
Another.

490
00:55:44,284 --> 00:55:49,800
- You're made of the wax 
from 362 burned-out... - Seven

491
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:55,740
Seven burned-out candles
 that I found in the wood-bin
 behind the magpie church

492
00:55:56,615 --> 00:56:00,291
I kneaded them all
 together and blowed you dry. 

493
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,640
Kid's say I come from
 you fucking a box-turtle. 

494
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:12,173
Them kids are likely to wake
 up one morning with their tongues
 sewn to the roofs of their mouths.

495
00:56:14,462 --> 00:56:15,737
Draw my bath.

496
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:18,695
Yes, mama.

497
00:56:20,108 --> 00:56:22,440
And my pisspot's full.

498
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,346
Yes, mama.

499
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,175
Why are you doing this to me?

500
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:15,784
What'd I ever do to you?

501
00:57:19,277 --> 00:57:21,675
I know you and I don't wanna know you?

502
00:57:23,637 --> 00:57:27,606
Leave me alone. Go away. 
Go bother somebody else. 

503
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,951
It's not loaded. 

504
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:35,591
Then what good is it?

505
00:58:41,917 --> 00:58:43,146
Your hands are dirty.

506
00:58:44,966 --> 00:58:46,393
I was burying Laurent.

507
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:50,428
I see.

508
00:58:50,733 --> 00:58:52,182
How would you like to die?

509
00:58:53,290 --> 00:58:56,844
I would prefer to fall
 from a great height.

510
00:58:57,773 --> 00:58:59,751
To get as high as possible.

511
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:02,642
Rocket to the sky.

512
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:07,042
And let the earth pull 
me to it and crash me.

513
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:10,262
You're not afraid?

514
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,408
Everything must die, even the earth. 

515
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,791
But not even death is everlasting. 

516
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,735
Winter slaughters autumn.

517
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,535
And the world disintegrates.

518
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,158
Digs itself a shallow grave. 

519
00:59:27,715 --> 00:59:32,380
And relinquishes itself to 
slumber, only to reappear. 

520
00:59:33,664 --> 00:59:36,373
In the same way, our 
souls must be recalled. 

521
00:59:37,426 --> 00:59:41,082
To become grist for
 the mill once again. 

522
00:59:43,224 --> 00:59:45,242
There is no mysteries in death. 

523
00:59:47,008 --> 00:59:47,895
Only life. 

524
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:52,017
Are you sure she is the one?

525
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,437
You don't know?

526
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:59,256
Sometimes, when you 
look into a woman's eyes

527
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:02,060
You find a labyrinth of
 your own invention. 

528
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,302
It's easy to get lost. 

529
01:00:07,113 --> 01:00:08,666
Because it is make believe. 

530
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:12,160
It's her, you know it is. 

531
01:00:12,446 --> 01:00:13,724
I know a nice girl for you. 

532
01:00:14,173 --> 01:00:15,655
She has one leg made of wood. 

533
01:00:15,717 --> 01:00:19,010
She does not swim, but 
she floats remarkably well. 

534
01:00:19,124 --> 01:00:20,842
Oh, Soul brother number 2!

535
01:00:20,877 --> 01:00:22,580
I don't wanna girl that floats. 

536
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,537
What's that man doing on our property?

537
01:01:16,504 --> 01:01:19,846
That man only wants
 to be fed once a day. 

538
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,391
He practically begged me for work. 

539
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:25,160
You're short.

540
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,528
A dollar fifteen. 

541
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,522
I accidentally stained some yarn. 

542
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,402
You be more careful. 

543
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:38,948
I don't trust him, he looks dangerous

544
01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:41,151
I don't want you going near him. 

545
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:44,860
He looks evil, like a serial killer. 

546
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,873
I bet you he his.

547
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,648
I think we should get married. 

548
01:02:09,591 --> 01:02:11,093
Why are you doing this to me?

549
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,824
<i>I know we're supposed to be together. </i>

550
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,957
<i>We'd been exiled into limbo,
 but now we've awoke. </i>

551
01:03:04,546 --> 01:03:08,722
<i>I'll tell you a secret. 
There is magic all around us. </i>

552
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:14,011
<i>You just have to look for it. 
Henry Berst. Cab driver. </i>

553
01:06:00,637 --> 01:06:04,557
<i>Until recently, I found myself 
crying for no reason at all. </i>

554
01:06:05,915 --> 01:06:07,968
<i>As if somebody else lived inside of me. </i>

555
01:06:08,448 --> 01:06:11,751
<i>And thought about the things
 I tried desperately to forget. </i>

556
01:06:12,584 --> 01:06:15,880
<i>All the fears and all the desires 
I had lost a long time ago. </i>

557
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:20,231
<i>At some point, that
 solemn stranger took over. </i>

558
01:06:20,773 --> 01:06:23,084
<i>I began to slowly disappear. </i>

559
01:06:23,710 --> 01:06:27,373
<i>I was a simple, lonely, man
 with a crippled destiny. </i>

560
01:06:28,184 --> 01:06:33,019
<i>But all that changed the moment 
I saw you. I am filled with hope. </i>

561
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,942
<i>I now see my future through 
the prism of your heart. </i>

562
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:10,493
<i>Please stop. </i>

563
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,971
<i>I'm not the woman you think I am. </i>

564
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,886
<i>Get as far away from here as you can. </i>

565
01:07:18,062 --> 01:07:20,413
<i>This place will pull you into itself. </i>

566
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,644
Attack!

567
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,266
<i>As a child I had a vision of paradise. </i>

568
01:09:58,591 --> 01:10:00,928
<i>A place high atop a mountain. </i>

569
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:04,480
<i>Quiet. Peaceful. Innocent. </i>

570
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:10,605
<i>I thought it was lost forever, but now 
I know it is still out there somewhere.</i>

571
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,482
<i>Hidden just out of site, waiting for us. </i>

572
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:19,651
<i>I believe God makes hearts in pairs. </i>

573
01:10:20,106 --> 01:10:23,386
<i>Then jumbles them up and
 scatters them all around the world. </i>

574
01:10:23,768 --> 01:10:26,168
<i>It's up to us to find each other. </i>

575
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,384
<i>Most of the time we never do. </i>

576
01:10:28,537 --> 01:10:31,182
<i>Sometimes we pass, inches apart. </i>

577
01:10:31,195 --> 01:10:33,890
<i>And never realise 
how close we really are. </i>

578
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:37,397
<i>Please open your heart. </i>

579
01:10:39,028 --> 01:10:40,664
<i>Don't let this chance slip away. </i>

580
01:12:40,533 --> 01:12:42,977
No. See me in your mind. 

581
01:12:46,346 --> 01:12:47,764
But I wanna touch you.

582
01:12:48,022 --> 01:12:48,966
You'll ruin it. 

583
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:54,564
I don't know why I'm 
here. I'm confused. 

584
01:12:54,830 --> 01:12:57,162
That's alright. Just take your time. 

585
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,966
Why do you want me so bad, 

586
01:13:00,226 --> 01:13:01,948
You come all the way from nowhere and

587
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:05,308
hit me so hard and break me down. 

588
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,515
Just trust that it's right. 

589
01:13:09,548 --> 01:13:13,068
Be patient. This is hard for me. 

590
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:17,768
Come with me.
 Together we'll find paradise. 

591
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:20,522
And what will it cost me?

592
01:13:21,448 --> 01:13:24,706
Your faith and a single kiss. 

593
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:29,764
Look where that got Christ. 
How can I trust you?

594
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:33,511
What can I do to prove myself?

595
01:13:38,966 --> 01:13:39,884
Dig me a hole. 

596
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:43,204
A hole?

597
01:13:45,602 --> 01:13:46,320
A hole.

598
01:13:50,355 --> 01:13:51,553
I'll dig you a thousand. 

599
01:13:52,453 --> 01:13:53,577
Just one'll do. 

600
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:57,306
How deep?

601
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:03,442
Until I say stop, or 
until you fall out of love. 

602
01:14:06,433 --> 01:14:07,644
If that's what you want. 

603
01:14:10,295 --> 01:14:11,322
And the kiss?

604
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,988
<i>I had a dream. A fantastical vision. </i>

605
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,970
<i>It's a man and a woman. </i>

606
01:15:59,611 --> 01:16:01,884
<i>floating high into the sky. </i>

607
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:04,582
<i>Two pioneers of bliss. </i>

608
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,748
<i>Relieved of gravity.</i>

609
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:09,798
<i>Henry, can you hear me?</i>

610
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:11,904
<i>Lifting, higher and higher.</i>

611
01:16:12,382 --> 01:16:14,602
<i>Until they disappear into themselves. </i>

612
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,015
<i>Come to me, Henry. </i>

613
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:36,845
Sometimes, I come out here late
 at night and watch the stars shiver. 

614
01:17:38,022 --> 01:17:41,844
Listen to them rip tiny holes in the sky.

615
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:46,488
Feel the world wobble off its spindle.

616
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:51,931
What do you believe in?

617
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:57,260
Milwaukee

618
01:17:59,870 --> 01:18:00,846
Where is it anyway?

619
01:18:02,510 --> 01:18:03,184
I don't know. 

620
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:09,812
One day this old 
telephone book fell out of the 
sky and nailed me on the head. 

621
01:18:10,910 --> 01:18:16,142
I looked down and 
there it is. Milwaukee.  

622
01:18:18,415 --> 01:18:19,986
I believe in signs like that. 

623
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:27,573
Before we do anything, 
there's something I should tell you.

624
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:35,637
I got a little stream of
 hair, running down from my 
belly-button to my pot-holder.

625
01:18:37,388 --> 01:18:38,064
I don't mind.

626
01:18:57,782 --> 01:18:58,577
What are you doing?

627
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:03,313
When you leave me, 
you'll take away a scar. 

628
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:11,984
Tonight I'm gonna dream 
that you devour me in my sleep.

629
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:15,815
So tomorrow, I'll wake up inside you.

630
01:20:49,628 --> 01:20:52,357
You think you're so smart. 

631
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,231
Find another one to 
climb in your sticky web. 

632
01:20:57,442 --> 01:20:59,551
I'm going to fix you.

633
01:21:00,371 --> 01:21:03,275
I'm going to have a 
talk with your friend. 

634
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:05,877
You hear me?

635
01:21:08,020 --> 01:21:10,608
I'm going to tell him 
the truth about you.

636
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:15,246
What you did to your daddy.

637
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:18,928
What you did to this family. 

638
01:21:21,370 --> 01:21:24,551
What kind of poison 
courses through your veins. 

639
01:21:26,022 --> 01:21:27,200
You hear me?

640
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,622
We'll see how long he sticks around. 

641
01:21:37,420 --> 01:21:38,386
I'll tell him.

642
01:21:42,266 --> 01:21:42,882
Mama?

643
01:21:45,453 --> 01:21:46,862
I said I'll tell him. 

644
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:49,737
Mama?

645
01:22:39,031 --> 01:22:41,020
Henry, there's
 something I got to tell you. 

646
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:44,014
My daddy hurt me when I was little. 

647
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:47,293
<i>My daddy hurt me when I was little. </i>

648
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,389
Fatima?

649
01:23:27,926 --> 01:23:28,900
Fatima?

650
01:23:38,313 --> 01:23:40,838
You let that poor thing out of there.

651
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:43,180
That poor thing's got distemper. 

652
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:45,040
Fatima!

653
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:49,117
She doesn't want anything 
to do with you, mister. 

654
01:23:49,537 --> 01:23:50,250
Where is she?

655
01:23:50,537 --> 01:23:52,220
She is not here. 

656
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:55,137
You don't want her anyway. 

657
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,598
She's a whore. Poison. 

658
01:23:58,053 --> 01:23:59,831
Rotten right through,

659
01:24:55,582 --> 01:24:56,842
It was a small hammer. 

660
01:25:00,746 --> 01:25:02,091
A ball-pein, I think.

661
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:08,006
I like a ball-pein. 

662
01:25:17,371 --> 01:25:18,626
Take me away from here.

663
01:26:07,535 --> 01:26:08,264
You alright?

664
01:26:10,195 --> 01:26:11,162
You don't look so good. 

665
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:14,965
Maybe we should go to a 
hospital and get you a head check. 

666
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:18,497
Let me know if you 
see an old French guy.

667
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,295
Holy shit!

668
01:27:02,522 --> 01:27:04,524
Everything's so tiny in here.

669
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:07,148
Midget's must have lived here. 

670
01:27:10,084 --> 01:27:11,784
Take your clothes off
 before you come in.

671
01:27:56,017 --> 01:27:57,766
What are you doing all 
the way over there, Henry.

672
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:01,742
You weren't never shy before. 

673
01:28:06,802 --> 01:28:07,886
I feel unusual.

674
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,895
There's nothing to be scared of. 

675
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:19,280
We're giants in here.

676
01:28:42,110 --> 01:28:46,897
The man and his wife were
 both naked and not ashamed. 

677
01:28:57,460 --> 01:28:58,784
<i>Henry, can you hear me?</i>

678
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:02,877
<i>Henry, can you hear me?</i>

679
01:29:05,440 --> 01:29:06,748
<i>Where are you, Henry?</i>

680
01:29:08,540 --> 01:29:09,462
<i>Where are you?</i>

681
01:29:27,835 --> 01:29:29,368
Who's watching you sleep?

682
01:29:31,897 --> 01:29:33,515
You're pretty ugly when you sleep.

683
01:29:38,757 --> 01:29:39,591
Sorry.

684
01:29:40,186 --> 01:29:41,237
You can't help it. 

685
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,573
I don't mind anyways.

686
01:29:45,831 --> 01:29:49,771
Just reporting a fact, 
though you'd like to know.

687
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:54,828
Thanks. 

688
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:11,642
Something pissed all over my clothes.

689
01:30:13,926 --> 01:30:15,253
Where'd you like to 
spend the rest of your life?

690
01:30:15,262 --> 01:30:16,686
And if your wish could come true.

691
01:30:18,670 --> 01:30:21,133
In a house. Doesn't have to be big. 

692
01:30:21,717 --> 01:30:23,253
Yeah, a trailer would be alright. 

693
01:30:24,317 --> 01:30:25,140
Just you and me.

694
01:30:25,302 --> 01:30:26,717
That's it, nothing else?

695
01:30:27,775 --> 01:30:28,693
Maybe a dog.

696
01:30:30,190 --> 01:30:31,420
Unless you don't like dogs. 

697
01:30:31,690 --> 01:30:34,766
It doesn't matter to me, 
but a dog would be nice.

698
01:30:35,140 --> 01:30:38,815
I want to take you to a place
 beyond your wildest imagination.

699
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:47,482
You got any money?

700
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:25,502
This is a stick-up.

701
01:31:28,349 --> 01:31:29,907
Don't make any sudden moves.

702
01:31:30,590 --> 01:31:32,355
I'm a very dangerous man. 

703
01:31:32,671 --> 01:31:34,655
There's no future in nobility.

704
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:57,873
Ed, you know that you got a 
naked man out there pumping gas?

705
01:31:58,840 --> 01:31:59,453
Yep.

706
01:32:03,862 --> 01:32:05,097
Stay where you are.

707
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,060
Count backwards to 100.

708
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:11,711
Thank you very much.

709
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:22,411
Do you even know where we're going?

710
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,571
I know where we're going, 
I just don't know how to get there.

711
01:32:24,580 --> 01:32:26,260
 Not yet. Trust me, OK?

712
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:28,340
I trust you, Henry. 

713
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:32,064
I think we passed 
that water tower already. 

714
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:35,260
'Erma loves Ricky'. It's the same.

715
01:32:35,710 --> 01:32:36,942
We're going in circles. 

716
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:40,857
We're not going in
circles, it's all working out. 

717
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:42,784
Just got to have faith. 

718
01:33:25,684 --> 01:33:26,555
We're here. 

719
01:33:28,724 --> 01:33:29,406
Where?

720
01:33:31,557 --> 01:33:33,057
This is what I saw when I was a kid. 

721
01:33:37,788 --> 01:33:40,060
What would you say if I 
told you an angel will come for us?

722
01:33:41,040 --> 01:33:42,995
You mean the ones you
 told me about before?

723
01:33:43,864 --> 01:33:46,726
Nah, they were French. 
This one is from a cigar ad. 

724
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:54,744
It's out there. And we found it. 

725
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:01,604
We found what?

726
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:05,695
Paradise. We have to go. 

727
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,408
We go up there, 
we die. Plain and simple. 

728
01:34:12,773 --> 01:34:15,437
The first time in my 
life I understand everything. 

729
01:34:18,726 --> 01:34:19,937
This is a joke, right?

730
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:31,635
We can stay up here
 for a while if you want, but we 
got to go back down sometime. 

731
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:35,031
It's chaos down there. 

732
01:34:37,670 --> 01:34:40,577
Me and you are different.
 We don't belong with them. 

733
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,382
Henry!

734
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:55,637
For a long time, we were both broken. 

735
01:34:58,390 --> 01:35:03,540
That's all changed now. 
We've found paradise.

736
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:09,362
It's in your eyes and my eyes. 

737
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:11,931
But only when we're 
looking at each other. 

738
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,680
There's nothing out there. It's empty. 

739
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:03,042
What's wrong, Henry?

740
01:36:31,250 --> 01:36:31,973
Henry?

741
01:36:44,730 --> 01:36:47,588
Surface dive. Sunfish.

742
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:52,464
Accordion float. Torpedo. Splash kick.

743
01:37:07,764 --> 01:37:10,151
Henry, what are you doing here?

744
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:12,528
You are ruining my film.

745
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,188
Where am I?

746
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,911
You are in my film.

747
01:37:17,230 --> 01:37:18,608
What's going on, Laurent?

748
01:37:19,300 --> 01:37:21,996
I was following the angel, 
there must be some kind of mistake. 

749
01:37:22,173 --> 01:37:23,390
You are telling me.  

750
01:37:23,537 --> 01:37:26,335
You should know better. 

751
01:37:26,640 --> 01:37:28,938
You and your large 
automobile are in my shot. 

752
01:37:29,940 --> 01:37:30,951
Can you swim? 

753
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:33,702
What?

754
01:37:34,140 --> 01:37:35,304
Swim? Swim?

755
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:37,346
No.

756
01:37:38,517 --> 01:37:41,680
<i>Another snag. 
The subject does not swim. </i>

757
01:38:04,970 --> 01:38:06,315
What do you want from me.

758
01:38:06,622 --> 01:38:09,200
Where am I? Where have you taken me?

759
01:38:09,350 --> 01:38:12,413
You followed me. 
For what reason, I don't know. 

760
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,773
You promised me paradise.

761
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:18,695
You've wasted your life for 
something that only exists in your mind. 

762
01:38:19,597 --> 01:38:20,751
You wanted more. 

763
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,266
You people always want more. 

764
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,620
I want to go back.

765
01:38:26,100 --> 01:38:29,846
You're being very silly. 
You'll enjoy the solitude.

766
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,693
Sit down and relax. Listen to
 the music our friend makes. 

767
01:38:34,782 --> 01:38:37,415
He plays rather well, don't you think.
