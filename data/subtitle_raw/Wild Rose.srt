70
00:04:31,404 --> 00:04:33,703
Fucking "A."

71
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,299
Right. I'll see you.

00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,775

Ooh. Hi.

76
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,455
- Come on, Lyle.
- Come.

77
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,481
Where do you think
you're going,

78
00:05:37,505 --> 00:05:39,804
all done up like a fish supper?

79
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,941
I see he's got you down,
so he has.

80
00:05:42,977 --> 00:05:44,537
That's scary.
Don't do that.

81
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,078
Anyway,
I'm not going anywhere.

82
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:47,810
I'm having
my dinner with you.

83
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:50,477
"No, down this way."

84
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,784

you never speak.

00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,473

00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,810

00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,231
Rose-Lynn!

90
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:42,101
I thought you were
your mum there.

91
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:44,568
That can't have
been 12 month.

92
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,132
The time's went by like that.

93
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,438
Yeah.

94
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:55,182
Hello, Marion!

95
00:06:55,218 --> 00:06:57,380
Night, both of you.

96
00:07:01,124 --> 00:07:04,151
She looks good, Amanda.

97
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:05,594
Oh, so she should.

98
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:07,359
Enough time at it.

99
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:09,298
Does she still lie
out here on tinfoil?

100
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,861
Oh... one peek of the sun
and that one's in a bikini.

101
00:07:12,903 --> 00:07:14,314
Other day, she was in
after my butter.

102
00:07:14,338 --> 00:07:17,035
- Your butter?
- Puts it all over.

103
00:07:17,074 --> 00:07:19,270
"It's natural, Marion."

104
00:07:19,309 --> 00:07:21,403
Aye. Natural if you're a roll.

105
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:32,514
Mary was gonna come tonight
and see you,

106
00:07:32,556 --> 00:07:34,616
but she's awful bad
with her arthritis, so...

107
00:07:34,658 --> 00:07:36,423
Och, that's a shame.

108
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,461
Aye.

109
00:07:37,495 --> 00:07:38,519
It's in her knees now,

110
00:07:38,563 --> 00:07:40,998
so that's her had to retire.

111
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:45,030
So...

112
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:48,268
£8 an hour.

113
00:07:48,306 --> 00:07:50,241
Holidays.

114
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,471
Says she'll see you into it
as a favor to me.

115
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,536

116
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:56,343

117
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:58,282

118
00:07:58,316 --> 00:07:59,978
Thinking? No.

119
00:08:00,018 --> 00:08:01,281
I wasn't thinking.

120
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,083
I just got out.
Don't you worry about me.

121
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:06,091
No, I wasn't.
I was thinking about your kids.

122
00:08:07,992 --> 00:08:09,961
I'm going to Nashville.

123
00:08:09,994 --> 00:08:11,538
Well, you better mind
your tag doesn't go off

124
00:08:11,562 --> 00:08:13,156
when you're going
through security.

125
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:14,643
First thing the morrow,
I'm going down the Opry,

126
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,466
I'm gonna get my job back,
and I'm gonna work for it.

127
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,233
There's nothing for me here.

128
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,582
See, there, I can be
honing my craft.

129
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:22,074
I can be out gigging
every night.

130
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:23,107
Honing your cr...

131
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:24,474
Do you not think

132
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,172
you've sacrificed enough
for that fantasy?

133
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,255
Have we all not sacrificed
enough for that fantasy?

134
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,372
It isn't a fantasy.

135
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,007
It's the only thing
I'm good at.

136
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:31,493
Learn a trade, Rose-Lynn.
Go to college.

137
00:08:31,517 --> 00:08:32,661

- Cut hair... I don't care

but do something.

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,322
I wouldnae agree.

180
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:50,519
There's strong competition.

181
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,704
- What the fuck?
- You stupid fucker!

182
00:10:52,728 --> 00:10:54,287
Jackie!

183
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,541
You nicked my job,
you ratcatcher!

184
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:57,363
Get off me!

185
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,426
- Get off!
- Get your hands off me!

186
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:00,767
Get out.

187
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:02,567
Ten years,
I've been working here.

188
00:11:02,605 --> 00:11:04,283
- What am I supposed to do now?
- You're barred. Get out!

189
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:06,276
Fucking no-fucking-hopers
clubhouse.

190
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:07,777
- You're an animal!
- Bunch of cunts.

191
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,472
An animal!

192
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:23,826
Fuck!

193
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,520
Didn't know you
were on mornings.

194
00:11:49,553 --> 00:11:50,646
How's your lassie?

195
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:53,920
Ugh. Ask me tomorrow.

196
00:11:58,763 --> 00:12:01,597
He lives in the bottom half,
um, of the house,

197
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:03,397
and then there's
another house up the stair.

198
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:04,925
My mate Angie lives there.

199
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,614
And then they bought
the house next door.

200
00:12:06,638 --> 00:12:09,574
So Lauren lives next door,
where wee Doug...

so anything you do

215
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:09,429
we can see from in here.

216
00:13:09,469 --> 00:13:10,903
I've not done
anything to the gate.

217
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,997
You were effing
and blinding at the gate.

218
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,606
Shoes off.

219
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:17,475
No, it's far too much.
Oh, no, no, no, no.

220
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,741
What? He's got a Kindle or...

221
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:22,010
Yes.

222
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:23,547
What, will you...

223
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,518
Look, I only sent
the email round

224
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:28,716
because it feels like we're all
just buying too much plastic.

225
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:33,593
Aww, that's so sweet.

226
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:37,597
No, yeah.
That's fine. That's fine.

227
00:13:37,631 --> 00:13:39,361
Come in. Sit down.

228
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,391
Yeah, I've got to go.
I've got somewhere here.

229
00:13:41,434 --> 00:13:43,403
Aww. Okay.

230
00:13:43,436 --> 00:13:44,962
Pleasure.
Speak to you later. Bye.

231
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:48,036
Hello.

232
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:49,437
I'm Susannah.

233
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:50,968
- Hi.
- Thanks for coming.

234
00:13:51,012 --> 00:13:54,039
So, um, where have you been
working before now?

235
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:56,012
She's been up in Stirling.

236
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:59,316
Haven't you, Rose-Lynn?
But she's no plans to go back.

237
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:00,946
Oh, it's beautiful
up there.

238
00:14:00,988 --> 00:14:04,288
Majestic.

239
00:14:04,325 --> 00:14:07,625
Right.
I'm off to spend a penny.

240
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:15,901
So it's £12 an hour.

241
00:14:15,936 --> 00:14:17,802
£12?
Actually, Mary gets...

242
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,067
£8, right,

243
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:20,450
but she can afford
to go that low

244
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:21,786
because she's on
the brew as well.

245
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,608
Brew?
She drinks?

246
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:25,556
- I don't think Mary dr...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

247
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,708
The brew is, like, you know,
the dole.

248
00:14:27,749 --> 00:14:29,547
Like, on welfare.

249
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:31,712
Really?

250
00:14:31,753 --> 00:14:33,898
Whereas, you know, I'll not
be up to anything like that.

251
00:14:33,922 --> 00:14:36,050
It's just not me.
Know what I mean?

252
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,458
Don't embarrass her
by mentioning it.

253
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:41,327
Oh, you'll be needing
more bleach, Susannah.

254
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:43,355
I'll give you
the receipt for it.

255
00:14:43,398 --> 00:14:44,559
Okay. Thanks.

256
00:15:04,687 --> 00:15:05,882
Rose-Lynn?

257
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:09,391
- Oh! Jeez.
- Rose-Lynn?

258
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,688
Sorry.

259
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,787
Um... um, I'm just gonna pop out,

260
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,856
and, uh, I'll be back
in about an hour, okay?

261
00:15:15,898 --> 00:15:17,491
Okay.

262
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,434
Oh, uh... or maybe less.
I...

263
00:15:19,469 --> 00:15:20,779
I don't...
I'm in and out all day,

264
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,014
so I... I don't know
when I'll be back.

265
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:23,097
Just, uh...

266
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:26,039
Great.

267
00:15:26,075 --> 00:15:28,442
Right. See you in a bit.

268
00:16:27,605 --> 00:16:28,903

Where's your mum?

286
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,591
- Parking the car.
- Parking the car.

287
00:17:53,593 --> 00:17:55,528
You're like something
out of "The Shining."

288
00:17:55,562 --> 00:17:56,962
What's "The Shining"?

289
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,732
Well, you coming in?

290
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,813

of smell is it?</i>

292
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,775
Yeasty.

293
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,013
<i>What smell?</i>

294
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,612
Well,
I don't know what it is,

295
00:18:20,655 --> 00:18:22,266
but it sure as hell
isn't somebody baking bread.

296
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,054
<i>Okay, bear with me a minute.</i>

297
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,219
She won't touch ham,

298
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:28,889
and he won't eat
anything else.

299
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,798
And they've both now decided
they don't like yogurt.

300
00:18:31,832 --> 00:18:33,858
Have you got a calendar?

301
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,666
You need a calendar
for putting down their gym days

302
00:18:36,704 --> 00:18:38,002
and their holidays

303
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,617
and if they're needing
to bring something in.

304
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:41,337
Nine times out of ten,
they won't tell you.

305
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:42,636
- Yeah.
- So you need to go

306
00:18:42,678 --> 00:18:43,821
through their bags
once a week.

307
00:18:43,845 --> 00:18:45,643
And you need to pay these.

308
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:47,149
You can do it.
You've got a wage now,

309
00:18:47,182 --> 00:18:48,810
and you can pay
in installments.

310
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:50,819
Your gas, your water,

311
00:18:50,852 --> 00:18:53,845
and your electricity, and...

312
00:18:53,889 --> 00:18:56,324
there's your TV license
as well.

313
00:18:56,358 --> 00:18:57,951
Okey-smoky.

314
00:18:57,993 --> 00:18:59,825
Well, that's you set up here.

315
00:18:59,861 --> 00:19:02,061
Now, remember, you have to be
in immediate range of that

316
00:19:02,097 --> 00:19:05,261
from 7:00 at night until
7:00 in the morning, okay?

317
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,963
Hello?

318
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:09,198
- Aye.
- Excuse me?

319
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,603
Aye. Yeah?

320
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:12,335
Is that your wee boy
out here?

321
00:19:12,374 --> 00:19:14,866
- Hiyah!
- Lyle.

322
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:17,346
Open up! It's the police!

323
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,643
- Lyle.
- Hiyah!

324
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:20,013
Lyle.

325
00:19:20,049 --> 00:19:21,642
- Hi...
- Get in here!

326
00:19:21,684 --> 00:19:23,118
Right now.

327
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,897
Right. That's me away.

328
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:40,269
You know where I am

329
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:41,771
if you need me.

330
00:19:50,313 --> 00:19:53,011
No, no. You're staying here
with your mammy,

331
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,713
but you'll see me every day.

332
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:59,918
You'll see me every day,
you daftie.

333
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:02,188
I'm coming home with you.

334
00:20:02,226 --> 00:20:03,956
No, you stay with your mammy.

335
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,394
Now, be a good boy
for your mammy.

336
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:06,897
Come on.
Take hold of him now.

337
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:09,331
Keep hold of him.

338
00:20:12,069 --> 00:20:14,095
I want to go with my granny!

339
00:20:14,138 --> 00:20:16,107
No, you're not...

340
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,403
Shh.

341
00:20:17,441 --> 00:20:19,034
No, Lyle.

342
00:20:19,076 --> 00:20:22,205
I don't wanna stay here!

343
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:48,099
See, on Friday,
will we go out for our dinner?

344
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,003
I remember
what your favorite is.

345
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,039
It's pizza.

346
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:01,282
I like sausage,
cheese, tomato.

347
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,413
She likes cheese,
tomato, and cheese.

348
00:21:04,422 --> 00:21:06,051
Are you coming with us?

349
00:21:07,426 --> 00:21:08,894
Hmm?

350
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:26,278
- Right. That's me done.
- Okay.

351
00:21:28,147 --> 00:21:31,174
The kids tell me you're
a country and western singer.

352
00:21:31,217 --> 00:21:33,243
You taking the piss?

353
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:34,412
No.

354
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:36,445
Not at all.
Why do you say that?

355
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:38,958
"Country and western"?

356
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:41,153
No, it's just country.

357
00:21:41,193 --> 00:21:43,186
I didn't realize.

358
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,974
You must be very good,
because all I've heard all week

359
00:21:44,998 --> 00:21:46,796
is Rose-Lynn, Rose-Lynn,
Rose-Lynn.

360
00:21:48,001 --> 00:21:49,765
Why country?

361
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:51,829
'Cause it's three chords
and the truth.

362
00:21:58,845 --> 00:21:59,904
Wow.

363
00:21:59,946 --> 00:22:01,209
Yeah. It goes like that.

364
00:22:01,248 --> 00:22:03,808
Just gets
whatever's in there out.

365
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:08,515
Anyways,
I'll see you next week.

366
00:22:08,555 --> 00:22:10,217
Thanks very much.
Bye!

367
00:22:10,257 --> 00:22:11,520
Bye.

368
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:20,400
All right. Thanks.

369
00:22:22,837 --> 00:22:25,170
Oh, sorry. After you.

370
00:22:25,206 --> 00:22:27,107
Him? That fucking prick?

371
00:22:28,976 --> 00:22:30,171
Oh.

372
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,804
Shit. I'm sorry, mate. Fuck.

373
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:34,577
Fuck.

374
00:22:34,816 --> 00:22:36,512
- Watch yourself.
- Sorry, pal.

375
00:22:36,551 --> 00:22:38,543
- Sorry.
- Ah, I don't mind. It's fine.

376
00:22:38,586 --> 00:22:41,283
Ah. I'm all right, Davey.

377
00:22:41,322 --> 00:22:43,518
- That's me.
- No, no, no.

378
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:45,151
I just fell on the floor.

379
00:22:45,193 --> 00:22:47,389
- Where are you going?
- I've got my curfew.

380
00:22:47,428 --> 00:22:49,192
Never mind the curfew.
Come on. Stay.

381
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,391
Here, take it.
Drink mine.

382
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:52,366
Stay. Oi!

383
00:22:58,574 --> 00:23:00,099
Fuck!

384
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:25,194
Hello, Galloway's
the butchers.

385
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:27,066
What can I get you?

386
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:28,546
No, I'm playing with you.
I'm playing with you.

387
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,869
I'm only kidding you on.

388
00:23:30,906 --> 00:23:32,238
Aye, yeah.

389
00:23:32,274 --> 00:23:34,972
Rose-Lynn Harlan. I'm here.

390
00:23:35,011 --> 00:23:37,412
All right. Okay. Bye.

391
00:23:37,447 --> 00:23:40,440
What happened to pizza?

392
00:23:47,523 --> 00:23:49,219
You can't promise them
something

393
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:51,091
and then just disappear.

394
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:53,255
- You cannae do that.
- I didn't disappear.

395
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,190
I... I was at my work,
waiting on my wages.

396
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:57,894
Oh, please.

397
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:00,096
You're not fooling anybody,
Rose-Lynn,

398
00:24:00,136 --> 00:24:01,627
and you cannae fool me.

399
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:05,073
If you tell them something,
you don't go back on it.

400
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:06,406
That's basic.

401
00:24:07,644 --> 00:24:09,078
That's basic.

402
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:13,210
Right. Pizza.
Come on.

403
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:22,690
You don't like pizza.

404
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,158
Oh, don't you worry
about me, darling.

405
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,561
I'll have something else.

406
00:24:26,597 --> 00:24:28,930
You can get chocolate pizza.
Did you know that?

407
00:24:28,966 --> 00:24:30,662
- Chocolate pizza?
- Aye.

I've been listening
to this stuff

425
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:42,170
since you left on Friday,
and I can't stop.

426
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:45,506

Yeah, I... I was, um...

432
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,507
I was just thinking I could

433
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:23,414
give you some recommendations.

434
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,476
Like, strong women
and all that.

435
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,215
Oh, I'd love that.

436
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:28,731
I'd love that.
I'd love to hear you sing.

437
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,417
Where do you sing?
Is there, um...

438
00:26:30,457 --> 00:26:31,457
is there a scene?

439
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,153
Oh. No, no.

440
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:35,628
No, there's fuck all here.

441
00:26:35,662 --> 00:26:37,426
It's actually... I'm...

442
00:26:37,464 --> 00:26:39,410
well, I'm actually trying
to get to Nashville, you know.

443
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:40,834
Oh.

444
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:42,312
Yeah, I'm needing to raise
a couple of grand

445
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:45,204
so I can get flights
and hotel and...

446
00:26:45,239 --> 00:26:47,470
well, I can't drive, so I'm
needing a driver as well.

447
00:26:47,508 --> 00:26:49,148
And it wouldnae be
more than two or three.

448
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:50,668
Definitely less than five.

449
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,076
Oh.

450
00:26:54,115 --> 00:26:56,584
Rose-Lynn, I... I'm sorry.

451
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,108
I can't just give you money,

452
00:26:58,152 --> 00:26:59,196
if that's what
you're suggesting,

453
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,483
which I'm sure it wasn't.

454
00:27:00,521 --> 00:27:02,547
No, it was.

455
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:04,218
I can't do that.

456
00:27:04,258 --> 00:27:05,783
How no?

457
00:27:05,827 --> 00:27:07,571
I'm not being funny,
but I just kind of thought

458
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:10,121
with all the wee smelly candles
burning everywhere

459
00:27:10,164 --> 00:27:11,508
and bottled water
and all that, you know,

460
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:13,091
you wouldn't miss it.

461
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:14,712
I'll be old and gray
before I save the money,

462
00:27:14,736 --> 00:27:18,503
whereas you... you could just
drink out of the tap.

463
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:23,340
Anyway, never mind.

464
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:29,881
What are you actually doing

465
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,644
while you're waiting,
saving to go?

466
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:33,383
I've been
the star fucking attraction

467
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:35,857
at Glasgow's Grand Ole Opry
since I was 14.

468
00:27:35,891 --> 00:27:38,190
- And?
- And what?

469
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:40,287
And nothing.

470
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:41,558
Well, haven't you gone in

471
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:43,361
for one of those...
those TV talent shows?

472
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:45,143
They're not for folk who can
sing, those programs.

473
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,444
They're for folk
who want to sit in

474
00:27:46,468 --> 00:27:48,232
on a Saturday night
and watch the TV.

475
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,814
Yeah, but isn't it a way
of meeting someone here

476
00:27:49,838 --> 00:27:51,517
who can introduce you
to someone over there?

477
00:27:51,541 --> 00:27:53,840
There's nobody here.
That's why I'm away.

478
00:27:55,912 --> 00:27:57,676
No one in the whole of Britain

479
00:27:57,714 --> 00:27:59,239
knows anything
about country music?

480
00:27:59,282 --> 00:28:00,875
- Except me.
- Except you.

481
00:28:00,917 --> 00:28:03,284
Yeah, and Bob Harris.

482
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,548
Who's that?

483
00:28:05,889 --> 00:28:08,154
Well, he's a DJ
at BBC Radio 2.

484
00:28:08,191 --> 00:28:10,353
Pure legend, man.
Ancient wee guy.

485
00:28:10,393 --> 00:28:13,329
And he knows everything about
country music... all the stars.

486
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:14,922
They're his pals.

487
00:28:15,165 --> 00:28:17,191
That's great.

488
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:20,260
That's who you need
to write to.

489
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:21,566
Aye, yeah.
It's good thinking.

490
00:28:21,604 --> 00:28:24,199
I'll just away
and pop round his house.

491
00:28:27,877 --> 00:28:29,437
No, I can't do this.

492
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,506
- Why not?
- 'Cause I feel like a fanny.

493
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:36,717
- Okay, you two.
- Go on outside.

494
00:28:36,754 --> 00:28:39,417
- No.
- Yes. Ten minutes.

495
00:28:39,456 --> 00:28:41,823
All we're gonna do
is listen outside the door.

496
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:43,327
It's... it's fine.

497
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,589
- It's fine. It's cool.
- Sure?

498
00:28:44,628 --> 00:28:46,187

Ah, Pollok way?

531
00:31:26,127 --> 00:31:27,127
Aye, yeah.

532
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:28,386
Sam's from Clydebank.

533
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:30,057
Clydebank?

534
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,691
How'd you get here
from Clydebank?

535
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:32,793
Break in through a window?

536
00:31:34,403 --> 00:31:36,668
Learned a trade
from my father,

537
00:31:36,705 --> 00:31:38,571
and then I started up
on my own.

538
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,633
Ah. What trade?

539
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:46,506
Conservatories?

540
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:47,692
What, as in
they big glass things

541
00:31:47,716 --> 00:31:49,116
stuck on the side of houses?

542
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:50,710
- Hmm.
- I'm not being funny,

543
00:31:50,753 --> 00:31:52,619
but who needs
a conservatory in Glasgow?

544
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:53,986
You'd be surprised.

545
00:31:54,022 --> 00:31:55,684
Aye. I would be.

546
00:31:55,724 --> 00:31:57,556
- What are you looking for?
- iPad.

547
00:31:57,593 --> 00:31:58,788
Did Mum say you can have it?

548
00:31:58,827 --> 00:32:00,523
- No.
- No.

549
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:02,861
Tell you what: let's go
play some football, eh?

550
00:32:02,898 --> 00:32:05,094
Oh, you're getting heavy, boy.

551
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,801
Out of that uniform
and get some socks out.

552
00:32:08,837 --> 00:32:10,170
Do you want kids, Rose-Lynn?

553
00:32:10,407 --> 00:32:11,739
Aye, yeah.

554
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:16,169
Just not yet.

555
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:33,521
How was school today?

556
00:32:35,765 --> 00:32:37,063
Is Mrs. Pat still there?

557
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:40,161
Ah, sh... she hated me, Mrs. Pat.

558
00:32:43,072 --> 00:32:45,064
Is Ms. McDonald
still your favorite?

559
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:49,904
Ms. McDonald left.

560
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:56,642

561
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,168
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm?

562
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:13,854
I've got something.

563
00:35:13,895 --> 00:35:15,625
"Dear Susannah,

"I passed your email on to Liz.

566
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,865
Remember, Liz used
to piss in the sink."

567
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:25,101
She... um, oh, she works
on "The Today Programme,"

568
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:26,732
and she sent the link

who covers sport for Radio 2,

570
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:31,211
and he forwarded the link
to Bob Harris' producer.

571
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:32,736
Oh, my God.

572
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,874
- Oh, my fucking God.
- Wait.

573
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:37,044
"Bob will be very happy

600
00:36:32,976 --> 00:36:34,968
You served 12 months

601
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:37,947
for attempting to smuggle
a package of heroin

602
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:40,246
into Cornton Vale

603
00:36:40,283 --> 00:36:42,445
by throwing it over
the perimeter fence.

604
00:36:42,686 --> 00:36:44,814
I didn't know it was heroin.

605
00:36:44,854 --> 00:36:48,382
But you were reckless as to
what the package contained.

606
00:36:48,425 --> 00:36:50,018
Well, if you mean
I was off my face

607
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,427
and didn't ask what was in it,
then aye.

608
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:55,261
But I had kids and everything,
and they put me in jail.

609
00:36:55,298 --> 00:36:56,960
It's pure ridiculous.

610
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,411

my advocate said at the time.

611
00:36:58,435 --> 00:37:00,097
It's not my fault.

612
00:37:01,004 --> 00:37:02,996
Well, whose fault was it?

613
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:05,185
Well, it was
the judge's, obviously,

614
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:06,973
for giving me the sentence.

615
00:37:10,047 --> 00:37:11,447
Your Lordship,

616
00:37:11,482 --> 00:37:13,383
a more contrite young lady,

617
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:16,285
it would be hard to find.

618
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,290
Miss Harlan has done
a lot of soul-searching.

619
00:37:19,323 --> 00:37:23,385
She has dug deep...

620
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:26,420
and she's put her childish ways
behind her.

621
00:37:26,464 --> 00:37:29,332
She now works full-time
as a daily woman,

622
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:33,303
and her children are living
with her once again.

623
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:36,865
Though Miss Harlan
is no longer in prison,

624
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:39,103
neither is she free.

625
00:37:39,143 --> 00:37:42,410
Wearing a tag means she
is unable to seek employment

626
00:37:42,447 --> 00:37:44,211
in her own line of work.

627
00:37:44,249 --> 00:37:46,150

she's a daily woman.

00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:26,431
- Free toast.
- You can get free tea.

708
00:42:26,471 --> 00:42:28,167
Free bacon rolls.
And nobody's touching it.

709
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:29,606
- Not bad, eh?
- No, it's all right.

710
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:31,303
- It's a waste.
- You want one?

711
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:33,073
Here, I'll get you one, here.
One sec.

712
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:39,481
♪ Bacon rolls,
bacon rolls, bacon rolls ♪

713
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,422
♪ Bacon rolls, bacon rolls ♪
bacon rolls ♪

714
00:42:43,456 --> 00:42:45,652
- Jump in.
- Go, go.

715
00:42:45,691 --> 00:42:47,503
- See you later. Good luck.
- I'll see you later.

716
00:42:47,527 --> 00:42:49,120
Bye.

717
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,360
You seen my bag?

718
00:42:56,402 --> 00:42:58,564
- Sorry?
- I left my bag here.

719
00:42:58,604 --> 00:43:01,733
I left my bag
and my jacket on the seat.

720
00:43:01,774 --> 00:43:03,766
Um, I think you
took it with you.

721
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,780
No, I didn't take it with me.
I left it here.

722
00:43:06,813 --> 00:43:08,247
It can't just disappear.

723
00:43:12,151 --> 00:43:14,087
Did... did anyone come
and take it?

724
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:15,749
Shit.

725
00:43:15,789 --> 00:43:17,485
How is it not
your responsibility, right?

726
00:43:17,524 --> 00:43:19,686
'Cause this is all I've
got now... that and these.

727
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:22,252
Just tell me... tell me,
what is it I'm meant to do?

728
00:43:22,296 --> 00:43:23,559
Okay, as I've said,

729
00:43:23,597 --> 00:43:25,259
the train was thoroughly
checked,

730
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:26,776
and nothing's been handed in,
so you might be best

731
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,325
talking to the transport police

732
00:43:28,368 --> 00:43:30,462
and getting
a crime reference number.

733
00:43:31,805 --> 00:43:33,831
Are you okay?

734
00:43:33,874 --> 00:43:35,740
Do you need to phone someone?

735
00:43:37,678 --> 00:43:39,442
I'm only trying to help her.

736
00:43:46,487 --> 00:43:48,854
Sorry. Excuse me.

737
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:50,722
Sorry. Sorry about this.

738
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:53,318
Hi, I'm looking for the B...
um, I'm looking for the BBC.

739
00:43:53,361 --> 00:43:55,201
Right, well, okay,
you'll need to take the Tube

740
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:56,493
- down to...
- What?

741
00:43:56,531 --> 00:43:57,842
- Down to...
- No, I don't have any...

742
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:10,473
Do you know where the BBC is?

743
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:26,859
Oh, thank fucking God.

744
00:44:42,211 --> 00:44:44,442
Hi. Rose-Lynn Harlan.

745
00:44:45,314 --> 00:44:48,512
- Who are you here to see?
- Bob Harris.

746
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:50,577
- Have you got any ID?
- No.

747
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:53,453
No, some bastard stole my bag
on the way here, so no.

748
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:55,720
All right, I'm gonna
need you to sign in.

749
00:44:55,758 --> 00:44:57,420
What? Is it MI5 here?

750
00:44:57,459 --> 00:45:00,588
Jeez. They give you less hassle
in the police station.

751
00:45:00,629 --> 00:45:02,655
- Are you Rose-Lynn?
- Aye.

752
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:04,327
Hello. I'm Mark.
I'm Bob's producer.

753
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,563
Oh, jeez, it's so good
to see you, boy.

754
00:45:06,603 --> 00:45:08,538
You got here, then?

755
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,473
Aye, I did.

756
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:12,601
So the studio's through here,

757
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:15,669
and round here
is our control room.

758
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:18,409
And in the control room
is Bob Harris.

759
00:45:21,651 --> 00:45:23,882
You must be Rose-Lynn.

760
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,947
I cannae believe it.
I can't believe it's you. Oh!

761
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,391
Honest to God,
I thought you'd be tiny wee.

762
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:33,825
Oh, God,
is that where they go,

763
00:45:33,863 --> 00:45:35,388
Miranda Lambert and all that,

764
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:36,730
all they folk who come in here?

765
00:45:36,766 --> 00:45:38,394
It is, yeah.

766
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,996
And we've got someone fabulous
playing later.

767
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:42,969
Would you like to have
a look around?

768
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:47,235
So this is very exciting,

769
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:50,680
meeting a homegrown
country star from Glasgow.

770
00:45:50,715 --> 00:45:52,684
I mean, it's a great
music city, Glasgow.

771
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,516
All right, look, I'm trying
to get to Nashville, obviously,

772
00:45:55,553 --> 00:45:56,919
but I mean, who's ever heard

773
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:58,946
of a country singer
from Glasgow?

774
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,653
That's ridiculous.
It cannae be.

775
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:03,024
Why not?

776
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:08,028
Well, uh, see, my life...

777
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:11,259
my life's like being one
of they transsexuals, you know?

778
00:46:11,302 --> 00:46:12,565
When you're born a man

779
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,981
but you're meant
to come out a lassie.

780
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:15,530
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that is me.

781
00:46:15,573 --> 00:46:17,008
I should've been born
in America.

782
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:20,274
I... I'm an American.
But here I am.

783
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:22,508
Do you write?

784
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,641
- Oh, no.
- Can you play?

785
00:46:24,683 --> 00:46:26,413
No.

786
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,420
You know, honestly,
I don't think it matters

787
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:30,354
whether you're
from Glasgow, Scotland,

788
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:31,948
or Glasgow, Kentucky.

789
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:33,356
If you've got a voice

790
00:46:33,392 --> 00:46:35,588
and you've got something
to say...

791
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:39,496
I watched your link,
and you really do have a voice.

792
00:46:39,531 --> 00:46:42,365
So what do you need to say?

793
00:46:52,411 --> 00:46:55,610

794
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:58,641

Where's your bag
and your jacket?

814
00:48:02,783 --> 00:48:05,014
Susannah just picked me up
from the station just now.

815
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:06,850
I left it on her back seat.

816
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:15,927
- Was it good?
- Aye.

817
00:48:19,601 --> 00:48:21,126
What like was it, London?

818
00:48:21,169 --> 00:48:23,695
- Ugh, it was heaving.
- Oh, that's what Mary said.

819
00:48:23,738 --> 00:48:25,798
She's been down a couple
of times to see her nephew.

820
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,672
Said you can't move for people.

821
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:29,387
Honest to God, wherever
you go, people are like that.

822
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:31,642
Up your nose, in your mouth,
under your nails.

823
00:48:31,679 --> 00:48:33,739
Och, I couldn't stand that.

824
00:48:36,117 --> 00:48:38,916
What was he like? Bob?

825
00:48:38,953 --> 00:48:41,149
I think he was...

826
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:44,888
well, he was saying I need
to write my own tunes.

827
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,555
But what
am I gonna write about?

828
00:48:46,595 --> 00:48:48,689
"The bleach ran away
with the broom"?

829
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:53,661
You don't stick at things.

830
00:48:53,702 --> 00:48:55,603
You know, that's your trouble.

831
00:48:56,172 --> 00:48:58,038
But look at this house.

832
00:48:58,073 --> 00:49:00,907
When you put
your mind to something,

833
00:49:00,943 --> 00:49:02,571
you can do anything.

834
00:49:05,748 --> 00:49:08,479
Do you want a cup of tea?

835
00:49:08,517 --> 00:49:10,611
Och, no.
I'm away to my bed.

836
00:49:10,653 --> 00:49:12,451
I'm up early tomorrow.

837
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,186
But you can ask me
for my dinner.

838
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:21,698
Lyle's after telling me

839
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:22,975
how he likes
your mince and tatties

840
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:25,161
and he doesn't like mine.

841
00:49:25,202 --> 00:49:28,001
I don't have a mince.

842
00:49:28,038 --> 00:49:30,098
My mince is your mince.

843
00:49:32,843 --> 00:49:33,936
Night.

844
00:49:47,123 --> 00:49:48,250
Did I wake you up?

845
00:49:48,492 --> 00:49:49,892
No.

846
00:49:49,926 --> 00:49:51,861
I wanted some water.

847
00:49:59,537 --> 00:50:01,233
What's your book about?

848
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,968
About a girl and her dog.

849
00:50:05,009 --> 00:50:08,207
That sounds
a bit babyish for you.

850
00:50:08,246 --> 00:50:10,078
Key Stage 2.

851
00:50:17,154 --> 00:50:19,555
Boo!

852
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,115
Why are you doing that?

853
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:24,756
I don't know.

854
00:50:27,131 --> 00:50:29,896
Here, I'll take you
back to bed.

855
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:29,124
Those are nice.
Who are they for?

856
00:51:29,162 --> 00:51:32,860
This one's for Isla,
and this one's for Shona.

857
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:34,367
Isla and Shona.

858
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:38,939
You've got half-term coming up.
Do you know that?

859
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:41,635
Got a whole week off school.

860
00:51:41,674 --> 00:51:43,336
What'll we do, eh?

861
00:51:43,376 --> 00:51:45,311
We could go away
for a few days.

862
00:51:45,345 --> 00:51:47,814
- To the beach.
- I haven't went to the beach.

863
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:50,818
Yeah, you have.
You were too young to remember.

864
00:51:51,885 --> 00:51:55,117
We went just before...

865
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:58,284
just before you moved in
with your granny.

866
00:51:58,325 --> 00:52:00,123
You wanted to pick up
all the shells.

867
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,719
Remember that?

868
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:11,065
How come we were nae
allowed to see you?

869
00:52:12,706 --> 00:52:15,175
'Cause your granny didn't
want you coming to the jail.

870
00:52:16,944 --> 00:52:18,288
Who's gonna bring you
if she won't, eh?

871
00:52:18,312 --> 00:52:20,110
'Cause of baddies?

872
00:52:20,147 --> 00:52:21,274
Aye. Uh-huh.

873
00:52:21,315 --> 00:52:22,749
You werenae a baddy, though.

874
00:52:22,783 --> 00:52:23,944
You were outlaw.

875
00:52:23,984 --> 00:52:26,045
Who told you that?

876
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:27,180
You did.

877
00:52:31,259 --> 00:52:33,125
No, I wasn't an outlaw.

878
00:52:36,431 --> 00:52:38,093
I was a fanny.

879
00:52:38,133 --> 00:52:39,965
You said "fanny"!

880
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:52,940
How was it?

881
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:54,381
I tried calling you
so many times.

882
00:52:54,416 --> 00:52:56,112
Oh, I know.
I lost my phone.

883
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:57,380
No.

884
00:52:57,419 --> 00:52:59,786
- Yeah.
- What happened?

885
00:52:59,821 --> 00:53:01,949
- I actually got pinched.
- Oh, really?

886
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:03,152
- Yeah, out of my bag.
- Oh.

887
00:53:03,192 --> 00:53:05,320
- With my bag.
- Crap.

888
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:07,728
But it didn't matter.

889
00:53:07,763 --> 00:53:10,756
- It was fucking "A."
- Was it?

890
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,098
Really?

891
00:53:12,134 --> 00:53:14,035
I'm gonna get there.

892
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,301
I am going to fucking
get there.

893
00:53:16,338 --> 00:53:18,466
Course you bloody are.

894
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:21,234
- Listen.
- Yeah?

895
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:23,041
I'm gonna be 50
in a minute,

896
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:25,071
and I was gonna have
this drinks party

897
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:27,743
for which I've got
really little enthusiasm for.

898
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:29,911
'Cause over the weekend,
I realized what I really need

899
00:53:29,952 --> 00:53:31,443
is a party party.

900
00:53:31,487 --> 00:53:34,355
A great big fuck-off
house party,

901
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:37,918
featuring, say, a set
by a young up-and-coming

902
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,487
country singer,
Rose-Lynn Harlan.

903
00:53:40,731 --> 00:53:42,461
What, you want me to play
at your party?

904
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:44,832
Yeah.
Will you?

905
00:53:44,868 --> 00:53:46,336
Well, aye, yeah,
course I will.

906
00:53:46,369 --> 00:53:47,769
That is brilliant.

907
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:49,329
That's not the exciting bit.

908
00:53:49,372 --> 00:53:52,433
The exciting bit is,
instead of bringing gifts,

909
00:53:52,476 --> 00:53:54,342
people will contribute
to a... to a cause

910
00:53:54,377 --> 00:53:57,313
that's very close to my heart:
you.

911
00:53:57,347 --> 00:53:58,940
You perform a set.

912
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:01,349
If people like what they hear...
which they will...

913
00:54:01,384 --> 00:54:03,853
then they invest in you,
in your career.

914
00:54:03,887 --> 00:54:08,985
That's, like, 100 people
spending between £50 and £100.

915
00:54:09,025 --> 00:54:10,357
Voilà.

916
00:54:10,393 --> 00:54:13,454
By the magic of crowd funding,
you are there.

917
00:54:13,497 --> 00:54:15,398
- Where?
- The Isle of Man.

918
00:54:15,432 --> 00:54:16,765
Nashville!

919
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:21,272
What, you're gonna tax
your pals to come to your house

920
00:54:21,305 --> 00:54:23,365
for an audience
with your daily woman?

921
00:54:23,407 --> 00:54:26,434
- Yeah.
- You've lost the plot, hen.

922
00:54:30,148 --> 00:54:31,241
Oh, do you have a band?

923
00:54:31,282 --> 00:54:32,511
Aye, yeah.
Of course I do.

924
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:33,916
- When is it?
- Next Sunday.

925
00:54:33,951 --> 00:54:35,162
You've already booked
the week off,

926
00:54:35,186 --> 00:54:37,178
and you can use that time
to rehearse.

927
00:54:37,221 --> 00:54:39,053
Oh, no.

928
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:40,820
No, I can't do that week.

929
00:54:40,858 --> 00:54:42,369
But it's cool.
I don't need to rehearse.

930
00:54:42,393 --> 00:54:44,138
I've been playing
with these guys since I was 14.

931
00:54:44,162 --> 00:54:46,529
Rose-Lynn, you definitely
need to rehearse.

932
00:54:46,564 --> 00:54:48,123
If you're asking people
for money,

933
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:51,136
if... if you want people
to buy into the idea

934
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:52,412
that you're gonna make it
out there,

935
00:54:52,436 --> 00:54:53,837
then you need to put in

936
00:54:53,872 --> 00:54:56,137
a really professional
performance.

937
00:54:57,509 --> 00:54:59,034
Aye, yeah, cool.
Yeah.

938
00:54:59,077 --> 00:55:00,875
Fucking "A."

939
00:55:00,913 --> 00:55:03,348
Brilliant.
Whoo!

940
00:55:08,353 --> 00:55:12,120
Well, I can't fault it.

941
00:55:21,066 --> 00:55:24,525
Mum, uh, Susannah's
needing me in next week.

942
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:27,062
Well, she cannae have you.
Kids are on holiday.

943
00:55:27,105 --> 00:55:28,216
She can do without you
for a week.

944
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,333
I know it, but...

945
00:55:29,374 --> 00:55:30,934
You said you'd take them away.

946
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:32,254
Well, it's no, uh...
it's no cleaning.

947
00:55:32,278 --> 00:55:34,372
Um, I'd be doing...
it's rehearsing.

948
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,958
What it is,
I'm doing this gig at her house

949
00:55:35,982 --> 00:55:37,450
and she's invited
all these people,

950
00:55:37,483 --> 00:55:39,475
and I'm gonna perform
with my band.

951
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,353
And then... then
they're gonna invest.

952
00:55:42,388 --> 00:55:44,550
Invest?
Invest in what?

953
00:55:45,892 --> 00:55:48,521
In me.
In my career.

954
00:55:48,561 --> 00:55:50,462
In getting to Nashville.

955
00:55:50,496 --> 00:55:51,589
Oh.

956
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:55,194
Don't remember her
investing in Mary

957
00:55:55,235 --> 00:55:57,101
when she was in agony
with her hip.

958
00:55:57,136 --> 00:55:58,570
18-month waiting list.

959
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,301
If she'd money to spare,
she could have

960
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:02,400
- forked out on that.
- She isn't forking it out.

961
00:56:03,643 --> 00:56:05,271
She gave me a chance
to earn it.

962
00:56:05,311 --> 00:56:06,957
But it's got to be good.
No pub band quality.

963
00:56:06,981 --> 00:56:08,525
And we haven't got long
to put it together,

964
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:10,393
and I phoned the school
to see about holiday club,

965
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,181
but it's all full up.

966
00:56:12,219 --> 00:56:14,130
And even if it wasn't,
I'd rather they were with you,

967
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:15,165
you know, 'cause I don't want
them thinking that I've just...

968
00:56:15,189 --> 00:56:16,521
What? Thinking what?

969
00:56:16,557 --> 00:56:18,924
You cast them off
when you get a better offer?

970
00:56:18,959 --> 00:56:20,537
Or that all this is for nothing
'cause you've still got

971
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:22,189
one foot out the door?

972
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,529
I can't help you.

973
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:30,333
I havenae booked the time off.

974
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:33,304
You've been there 20 year.

975
00:56:35,075 --> 00:56:38,011
- Special circumstances.
- I've used that enough.

976
00:56:38,045 --> 00:56:40,276
Aye, when I was fucking up.

977
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:42,112
What's for you
will no go by you.

978
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:43,950
This is me trying to make
something of myself,

979
00:56:43,985 --> 00:56:46,454
and surely to God
that's a good thing for them.

980
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:48,184
A good thing for them?

981
00:56:48,223 --> 00:56:52,092
No letting them down
again and again and again,

982
00:56:52,127 --> 00:56:54,961
that would be
a good thing for them.

983
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:57,227
And I thought
you'd turned a corner.

984
00:56:57,265 --> 00:56:58,995
More fool me.

985
00:57:08,476 --> 00:57:11,139
- Where are we going?
- We're going to the beach.

986
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,511
We're going to go
into the sea

987
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:15,381
and look at different
jellyfish.

988
00:57:17,118 --> 00:57:18,450
Come on.

989
00:57:18,486 --> 00:57:19,545
That's a good boy.
Come on.

990
00:57:21,624 --> 00:57:23,024
There we go.

991
00:57:26,128 --> 00:57:27,940
- Oh, in youse come.
- I don't wanna go in there!

992
00:57:27,964 --> 00:57:29,956
- I don't wanna go in there!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

993
00:57:29,999 --> 00:57:31,610
Mary's gonna look after you
for a while this week, okay?

994
00:57:31,634 --> 00:57:34,126
I didnae say a week,
Rose-Lynn.

995
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:35,661
I said today.

996
00:57:35,705 --> 00:57:38,004
Oh, you're fine.

997
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,406
You're fine.

998
00:57:39,442 --> 00:57:41,707

01:00:17,203 --> 01:00:20,469
and after that, we'll go
to the lighting cues.

1052
01:00:21,374 --> 01:00:23,366
Big day tomorrow, gents.

1053
01:00:23,409 --> 01:00:25,902
This girl has cleaned
her last floor.

1054
01:00:27,581 --> 01:00:29,516
Please, leave it.
You don't have to do that.

1055
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:31,382
Oh, no, that's all right.
I'll just...

1056
01:00:31,418 --> 01:00:33,319
I'll just pop them inside.

1057
01:00:39,226 --> 01:00:41,161
I nicked it from
the tech guys.

1058
01:00:41,195 --> 01:00:43,596
Fancy a smoke?

1059
01:00:43,631 --> 01:00:45,896
Oh, no, I've...
I've got to go.

1060
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:47,458
- Really?
- Yeah.

1061
01:00:48,602 --> 01:00:50,264
Can you roll it?

1062
01:00:53,174 --> 01:00:56,838
When I first met Sam,
we lived in this...

1063
01:00:56,877 --> 01:00:59,574
shittiest little flat
on Clydeside.

1064
01:00:59,613 --> 01:01:02,277
There was nothing there.
Not like it is now.

1065
01:01:02,317 --> 01:01:04,377
We had rats
because of the river.

1066
01:01:04,419 --> 01:01:06,388
We were broken into
nearly once a week.

1067
01:01:06,421 --> 01:01:10,756
But we had these really,
really amazing parties.

1068
01:01:14,396 --> 01:01:15,557
Don't really want this.

1069
01:01:17,532 --> 01:01:18,795
You have someone?

1070
01:01:18,833 --> 01:01:20,893
No, I'm free as a bird.

1071
01:01:20,936 --> 01:01:22,336
Lucky you.

1072
01:01:25,907 --> 01:01:28,206
You're young.

1073
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:29,711
You're incredibly talented.

1074
01:01:29,744 --> 01:01:32,441
You're at the height
of your powers.

1075
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,472
There is nothing
you can't do.

1076
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,547
This is your time.

1077
01:01:38,754 --> 01:01:42,418
Once you got kids,
it's a little bit different.

1078
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:45,922
Yeah.

1079
01:01:50,633 --> 01:01:52,693
I'd better go.

1080
01:01:52,735 --> 01:01:54,829
Hello!

1081
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:56,361
- Hmm.
- How are you, honey?

1082
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:57,737
I'm fine, thank you.

1083
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:01,410
- I'll drop you home.
- Oh, no, no, you're all...

1084
01:02:01,444 --> 01:02:02,921
Yeah, it's fine.
I'll just take the bus.

1085
01:02:02,945 --> 01:02:04,573
- No, no, come on.
- No.

1086
01:02:09,418 --> 01:02:12,354
- Sleep well.
- Aye, yeah.

1087
01:02:12,388 --> 01:02:13,788
See you in the morning.

1088
01:02:26,503 --> 01:02:28,768
You homesick, aye?

1089
01:02:28,805 --> 01:02:30,933
Mm.

1090
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,034
What, is this the one
where you try

1091
01:02:48,058 --> 01:02:49,890
and stick it up
the daily woman?

1092
01:02:49,926 --> 01:02:51,724
No, no.

1093
01:02:55,366 --> 01:02:56,732
This is the one
where I tell you

1094
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:57,997
that I'm onto you.

1095
01:02:59,804 --> 01:03:01,500
I know you did the jail.

1096
01:03:02,473 --> 01:03:03,839
And I know
what you were in for.

1097
01:03:09,447 --> 01:03:11,916
Susannah's bought into
whatever it is you're selling,

1098
01:03:11,949 --> 01:03:14,612
and I'm not about to take that
away from her now.

1099
01:03:16,354 --> 01:03:18,482
But I don't want you
anywhere near my kids,

1100
01:03:18,523 --> 01:03:22,483
so, see, the morrow,

1101
01:03:22,527 --> 01:03:23,995
sing your song,

1102
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:27,055
get your money,
then you're gone.

1103
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:55,523
Lyle.
Hurry up.

1104
01:03:56,729 --> 01:03:57,924
Haven't got all day.

1105
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:02,431
Rosie.

1106
01:04:02,468 --> 01:04:03,595
Where you been, man?

1107
01:04:03,635 --> 01:04:05,365
Havenae seen
hide nor hair of you.

1108
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,431
All right, wee man?

1109
01:04:08,475 --> 01:04:09,738
I'll be in in a minute.

1110
01:04:14,147 --> 01:04:16,707
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

1111
01:04:18,785 --> 01:04:22,153
- You all right, pal?
- Aye, you know, I'm brand-new.

1112
01:04:22,389 --> 01:04:24,551
Looking for something.

1113
01:04:28,628 --> 01:04:30,961
- Lyle!
- Mum!

1114
01:04:30,997 --> 01:04:32,693
His name's Lyle.
He's five.

1115
01:04:32,732 --> 01:04:34,098
He swung on a wardrobe

1116
01:04:34,134 --> 01:04:35,693
and then the wardrobe
fell on him.

1117
01:04:35,735 --> 01:04:36,879
I think it's just his arms
that he's hurt

1118
01:04:36,903 --> 01:04:38,804
but maybe his head as well.

1119
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:41,569
Okay, Lyle, do you mind
if I have a wee look?

1120
01:04:41,608 --> 01:04:45,046
Ow!

1121
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:46,479
- All right.
- It's okay.

1122
01:04:46,514 --> 01:04:47,758
She's gonna have a wee look,
okay?

1123
01:04:47,782 --> 01:04:49,910
- Any allergies?
- No, I don't... I don't...

1124
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:52,613
- I don't think so, no.
- Fabric plasters.

1125
01:04:52,653 --> 01:04:55,589
Okay, um, we'll need
to X-ray him.

1126
01:04:55,623 --> 01:04:57,134
It's one of those nights
in here tonight,

1127
01:04:57,158 --> 01:04:59,559
so it might be a while
until a doctor sees youse.

1128
01:04:59,593 --> 01:05:01,687
- Okay?
- I want my granny.

1129
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:04,824
Please, I want my granny.

1130
01:05:04,865 --> 01:05:06,595
- Please.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1131
01:05:06,634 --> 01:05:08,660
I want my granny.

1132
01:05:15,075 --> 01:05:17,840
My next pill?

1133
01:05:17,878 --> 01:05:20,110
Water?

1134
01:05:20,148 --> 01:05:21,810
Thanks.

1135
01:05:39,968 --> 01:05:42,563
- Are you Lyle's mum?
- Aye, yeah.

1136
01:05:42,604 --> 01:05:43,902
- Dr. Yousaf.
- Hi.

1137
01:05:43,939 --> 01:05:45,635
- I'm sorry about the wait.
- No.

1138
01:05:45,674 --> 01:05:47,051
The X-ray looks
fairly straightforward,

1139
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:48,907
but he'll need a cast.

1140
01:05:48,944 --> 01:05:50,674
When can we go home?

1141
01:05:50,712 --> 01:05:52,790
We can't get the cast on
until the swelling's come down,

1142
01:05:52,814 --> 01:05:54,942
so we are looking
at a couple more hours.

1143
01:05:54,983 --> 01:05:56,714
I'm sorry it's been
such a long night.

1144
01:06:03,259 --> 01:06:05,057
Fucking hell.

1145
01:06:38,028 --> 01:06:40,293
- Where is he?
- He's still asleep.

1146
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:51,266
Right, I'll take
this one home,

1147
01:06:51,308 --> 01:06:52,908
and you can stay here
with the wee fella.

1148
01:06:52,943 --> 01:06:54,070
No.

1149
01:06:58,282 --> 01:06:59,716
No.

1150
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:03,616
What's for you
will no go by you.

1151
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,799
Maybe 20 year in the baker's
is enough for you,

1152
01:07:06,823 --> 01:07:08,189
but it's not enough for me.

1153
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:10,057
Away and get me a wee cup
of tea, darling.

1154
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,189
What's the matter with you?

1155
01:07:16,834 --> 01:07:21,966
I just... I just need you
to help... help me.

1156
01:07:22,006 --> 01:07:24,601
Help you?
Help you do what?

1157
01:07:24,642 --> 01:07:26,167
Leave him here
while you go to a party?

1158
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:27,974
Is that the plan?

1159
01:07:28,012 --> 01:07:30,880
I don't know what this
awffy-toffee woman

1160
01:07:30,915 --> 01:07:32,941
thinks you are,
but she wouldn't give you

1161
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:35,078
a brass farthing
if she knew the truth.

1162
01:07:39,857 --> 01:07:42,190
You haven't even told her,
have you?

1163
01:07:44,062 --> 01:07:47,727
She doesn't even have a clue
that you've got kids.

1164
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:54,097
If you're no even prepared
to acknowledge their existence,

1165
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:55,767
there's no hope for you.

1166
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:59,908
And there's sure as hell
none for them.

1167
01:08:04,049 --> 01:08:07,019
Go.
Go to Nashville.

1168
01:08:07,052 --> 01:08:08,680
Do whatever it is
you want to do.

1169
01:08:08,721 --> 01:08:10,280
Come on, darling.

1170
01:08:10,322 --> 01:08:11,950
Let's go see your wee brother.

1171
01:08:13,192 --> 01:08:15,661
- Have you been to sleep?
- No.

1172
01:08:15,694 --> 01:08:17,253
- Not at all?
- No.

Jesus Christ.

1187
01:10:03,872 --> 01:10:05,272
I thought you were a no-show.

1188
01:10:05,307 --> 01:10:07,276
The band have had
to talk me off a ledge.

1189
01:10:07,309 --> 01:10:09,505
You look tired.
You all right?

1190
01:10:09,745 --> 01:10:12,943
Aye, yeah, aye.
Yeah, I'm brand-new.

1191
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:14,359
- I'm great.
- Oh, good, good, good.

1192
01:10:14,383 --> 01:10:16,215
Come on, let's go.

1193
01:10:16,252 --> 01:10:18,016

1195
01:10:28,531 --> 01:10:31,899
Okay, um, so...

1196
01:10:31,934 --> 01:10:34,369
not long ago,
a spark of light

1197
01:10:34,403 --> 01:10:38,363
flew in through my door
and reminded me

1198
01:10:38,407 --> 01:10:41,138
of why I fell in love with
Glasgow in the first place.

1199
01:10:42,512 --> 01:10:46,279
The girl, like the city,
is gallus...

1200
01:10:47,784 --> 01:10:49,548
She's funny,
and above all else,

1201
01:10:49,786 --> 01:10:52,188
she's completely fearless.

1202
01:10:52,222 --> 01:10:54,817
And with your help,
she's going to Nashville

1203
01:10:54,858 --> 01:10:58,818
to do what she was put
on this Earth to do.

1204
01:10:58,862 --> 01:11:02,526
I'm so proud to know her
and call her my friend.

1205
01:11:03,834 --> 01:11:06,235
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together

1206
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,035
for Rose-Lynn Harlan!

1207
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,551
Okay, let's go.

1208
01:12:07,032 --> 01:12:09,297
So... s-sorry,
can you just give me...

1209
01:12:09,335 --> 01:12:11,031
give me... give me five?

1210
01:12:24,516 --> 01:12:26,985
Rose-Lynn.
Hey.

1211
01:12:27,019 --> 01:12:30,217
Hey!
Rose-Lynn.

1212
01:12:30,256 --> 01:12:31,933
Please, what's going on?
What are you doing?

1213
01:12:31,957 --> 01:12:33,335
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

1214
01:12:37,196 --> 01:12:38,630
What's happened?

1215
01:12:40,099 --> 01:12:41,294
Oh, darling.

1216
01:12:41,333 --> 01:12:43,064
Come on.

1217
01:12:43,103 --> 01:12:45,265
I don't know what... what you
see when you look at me,

1218
01:12:45,305 --> 01:12:47,297
but it isnae me.

1219
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:48,535
What are you talking about?

1220
01:12:48,575 --> 01:12:50,168
I'm not at the height
of my powers.

1221
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,405
I'm not free,

1222
01:12:51,444 --> 01:12:54,141
and there's so, so much
I can't undo.

1223
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:56,206
I can't undo
going to the jail.

1224
01:12:56,249 --> 01:12:59,413
I can't undo chucking in heroin
to all they lassies in there

1225
01:12:59,452 --> 01:13:01,148
already fucked for drugs.

1226
01:13:01,187 --> 01:13:03,588
And do you know what else
I cannae undo?

1227
01:13:03,623 --> 01:13:05,592
Having two kids.

1228
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:10,358
Two beautiful children
before I was 18.

1229
01:13:11,464 --> 01:13:13,956
Wynonna, she's eight.

1230
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,492
And Lyle, he's five.
And I...

1231
01:13:16,536 --> 01:13:20,304
I got 12 months in the jail
and I... I left behind two kids.

1232
01:13:23,210 --> 01:13:26,180
Yep.
That's the truth.

1233
01:13:26,213 --> 01:13:29,706
Not this.
That.

1234
01:13:29,951 --> 01:13:32,011
Them.

1235
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:34,488
Everything I made you
think I am,

1236
01:13:34,522 --> 01:13:36,115
I'm not.

1237
01:13:56,745 --> 01:13:59,010
Sorry, I'm just...

1238
01:14:45,261 --> 01:14:46,729
Come on.

1239
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:01,107
I see an island over there.

1240
01:15:01,144 --> 01:15:02,612
Island?

1241
01:15:04,213 --> 01:15:07,308
- Is that a clam?
- Do you think you can open it?

1242
01:15:33,644 --> 01:15:35,408
Miss Harlan?

1243
01:15:39,516 --> 01:15:45,319
What I'm gonna do, um,
and that... I mean,

1244
01:15:45,355 --> 01:15:48,190
I... I... I'll be happy
just mucking in.

1245
01:15:48,226 --> 01:15:49,421
I've got...

1246
01:15:58,103 --> 01:15:59,103

Did you make a wish?

1250
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:46,580
You can have mine.

1251
01:16:48,187 --> 01:16:50,156
Right, who's having
the first slice, eh?

1252
01:16:50,189 --> 01:16:51,817
- Me.
- Yeah?

1253
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,655
Good.

1254
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:45,379
It's only me.

1255
01:17:45,413 --> 01:17:46,972
Aye.

1256
01:17:51,586 --> 01:17:52,586
Aye?

1257
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:54,851
Have you got a wee minute?

1258
01:17:54,889 --> 01:17:56,255
Aye, yeah.

1259
01:18:04,232 --> 01:18:05,723
You already gave me something.

1260
01:18:15,811 --> 01:18:17,006
What's this for?

1261
01:18:20,349 --> 01:18:21,578
Why are you giving me this?

1262
01:18:23,452 --> 01:18:26,286
I wanted you to take
responsibility.

1263
01:18:26,321 --> 01:18:28,552
But I never meant
to take away your hope.

1264
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:33,529
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1265
01:18:35,397 --> 01:18:36,922
Maybe there is more to life.

1266
01:18:36,965 --> 01:18:38,661
Maybe there... there isn't.

1267
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,794
I don't know.

1268
01:18:40,836 --> 01:18:42,964
I've never been farther
than Dunoon.

1269
01:18:44,273 --> 01:18:45,866
But you need to away and see.

1270
01:18:47,876 --> 01:18:48,900
No.

1271
01:18:50,346 --> 01:18:51,939
I can't start
all that up again.

1272
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:55,011
It's finished.

1273
01:18:59,055 --> 01:19:01,354
I always said
I'd go to college,

1274
01:19:01,391 --> 01:19:03,792
if I hadnae had to go
out to work at 15.

1275
01:19:03,826 --> 01:19:04,953
And I would have.

1276
01:19:06,362 --> 01:19:07,955
I wanted to be a pharmacist.

1277
01:19:10,066 --> 01:19:12,501
The thing is...

1278
01:19:12,535 --> 01:19:14,834
What was stopping me,
you know?

1279
01:19:16,539 --> 01:19:19,441
Even after I had you,
I could have gone.

1280
01:19:22,979 --> 01:19:25,539
But I think it was just easier
for me to...

1281
01:19:25,581 --> 01:19:27,710
to want things for you

1282
01:19:27,751 --> 01:19:30,585
than to go after them
for myself.

1283
01:19:34,325 --> 01:19:35,987
I hadn't the gumption.

1284
01:19:36,994 --> 01:19:38,394
That's the truth.

1285
01:19:39,463 --> 01:19:41,659
But you...

1286
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:42,826
you do.

1287
01:19:47,471 --> 01:19:50,100
I'll look after the kids.

1288
01:19:50,341 --> 01:19:51,741
You go.

1289
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:55,005
You see what's waiting for you.

1290
01:20:09,094 --> 01:20:12,087

all this money from?

1291

of country music.

1344
01:25:26,752 --> 01:25:29,847
This is the exact spot
where bluegrass was born

1345
01:25:29,889 --> 01:25:33,189
and where Johnny Cash
met June Carter.

1346
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:35,319
Now, it was right here
that country music

1347
01:25:35,361 --> 01:25:37,854
found an audience
beyond its own back porch

1348
01:25:37,898 --> 01:25:40,697
and countless careers took off.

1349
01:25:40,734 --> 01:25:44,432
Now, when the Grand Ole Opry
put down roots here in 1943,

1350
01:25:44,471 --> 01:25:46,940

brought the likes

1390
01:29:21,527 --> 01:29:24,053
you could come
by the restaurant.

1391
01:29:24,096 --> 01:29:25,587
No.

1392
01:29:25,631 --> 01:29:29,966
