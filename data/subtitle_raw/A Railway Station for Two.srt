The roll call of Section 2 done.
No one absent without leave.

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,678
The roll call of Section 3 done.
No one absent without leave.

13
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,032
The roll call of Section 4 done.
No one absent without leave.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,834
- Take them to the barracks.
- Yes, sir!

15
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,309
Section!

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,588
Left turn! Quick march!

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,275
Ryabinin, stay behind.
Come here.

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,517
You're lucky, your wife's here.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,877
- Why?
- She wants a visit with you.

20
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,674
I didn't ask her to. I don't want
this visit.

21
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,119
She took a train, then a plane,
then a 24-hour bumpy truck ride.

22
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,879
I don't care, I'm not going.

23
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,594
You will go without convoy.
I trust you.

24
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,354
Where to?

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,110
She's taken a room in the village.
Here, the address.

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,277
You drop by Ivan Gerasimovich

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,355
and pick up the accordion he fixed.

28
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,873
You're a musician, this is your
department. Check if he fixed it right.

29
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,037
- Yes, sir.
- That's better.

30
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,030
You can't refuse to go
to pick up the accordion.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,031
But mind you, Ryabinin,
at 8 sharp you are to stand in line.

32
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,430
Your leave is until the morning roll
call. Tardiness will mean an escape.

33
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,199
How far is the village?

34
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,869
Not far, about nine or ten kilometers.

35
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,596
And don't think of bringing in booze,
a knife or money. I'll find it anyway.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,353
I know.

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,435
Your pass is good until 8 a.m.
Be here on the dot.

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,190
If you're late, it'll mean an escape.
You'll do an additional time. Go!

Attention, passengers! Our train
arrives in the city of Zastupinsk.

57
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,960
The stop duration is twenty minutes.

58
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,878
Yura, reserve a seat for me.

59
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,278
What will they give us to eat?

60
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,593
Pass me the salt, please.

61
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,871
Good afternoon, comrades!
Bon appetite!

62
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,038
- Miss!
- Just a minute.

63
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,278
Can you come to me?

64
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,790
- We have no mineral water.
- What about green salad?

65
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,037
It's not included in the lunch of
the day.

66
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,878
Please, bring me some diet food.

67
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,959
May I have a fork?

68
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,435
Please, some diet food.

69
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,190
Your train will leave
before they prepare your diet food.

70
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,278
If you got an ulcer, you'd better eat
at home, not at a restaurant.

71
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,597
Just the sight of this food
may provoke ulcer.

72
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:03,038
Prepare 1 ruble 20 kopecks for
the lunch. Exact change if possible.

73
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,039
- Can I have a beer?
- We don't have beer.

74
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,673
I can't eat this.

75
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,790
Miss, here's 1 ruble 20 kopecks.

76
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,438
Take the money, please.

77
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,797
What about the money?

78
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,516
For this lunch you should pay to us.
The money's on the table.

79
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,198
Who took the money?

80
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,198
In your line of work
you should first take the money.

81
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:33,871
All right. Who took the money?
Comrades! Girls! Thanks.

82
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,789
One has already left.
One left without paying, girls.

83
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,797
Please, pay for your lunch.

84
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,474
Just imagine, thatjerk with
a fat mug... Where're you going?

85
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,030
I didn't eat anything. My lunch
is over there, I didn't touch it.

86
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,880
How can I know whether you ate it
or not. One ruble 20 kopecks, please.

87
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,676
I never touched it. I wouldn't eat it!
Someone already ate it.

88
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,799
Come on, stop your tricks.
Pay me 1 ruble 20 kopecks.

89
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,436
I didn't eat and I'm not going to pay.
I'll late for the train. Let me go.

90
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,110
We don't earn enough
to pay for all of you!

91
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,030
Come on, you restaurant waitresses
can pay for everybody.

92
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,798
I'm late for my train!

93
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,674
- Call the police! Jerk!
- Fine, go call the police.

94
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,197
You may the whole police department.
I didn't eat and I'm not going to pay!

95
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,789
- You will!
- You'll see.

96
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,196
- Some dude!
- Call the police!

97
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,435
City slicker!

98
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,196
Nikolasha! This one won't pay.

99
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,792
I'm not going to pay, I didn't eat.
This is a matter of principle.

100
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,799
This man asked for diet food.

101
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,789
I said we don't have time.
Then he ate the lunch of the day...

102
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,878
We'll investigate, comrades.

103
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,198
What do you mean, investigate?
Are you going to examine my stomach?

104
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,597
- He ate it and won't pay!
- I didn't eat. Aren't you ashamed?

105
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,791
We'll draw up a report of
what you ate for 1 ruble 20 kopecks...

106
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,959
I didn't eat, and she says I did.
It's a matter of principle, you know.

107
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,360
I didn't eat. While you make up
your report, my train will leave.

108
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,949
Don't worry, I do it very quickly.

109
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,515
- Which train is yours?
- To Dushanbe.

110
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,032
His train has already left. It serves
him right for being miserly.

111
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,879
Wait!

112
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,039
He missed it!

113
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,278
His train went choo-choo!

114
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,672
Stop the train!

115
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,791
Now we got him! I'll have
my ruble and twenty kopecks.

116
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,038
Nikolasha, follow me!

117
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,952
By how you sweep
people judge about our city.

118
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,434
I'm a deputy stationmaster.

119
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,794
You see, she insists I pay
for the lunch I didn't eat.

120
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,629
It's a matter of principle, you see?
You can't eat at that restaurant.

121
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,799
I don't go to restaurants,
my wife is a great cook.

122
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,036
Restaurants are not under my
jurisdiction.

123
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,950
Because of her I missed my train.
I need to go to Griboyedov.

124
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,117
My dear passenger, one should be
more careful while traveling.

125
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:24,359
The railway means punctuality,
comfort and cleanliness.

126
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,792
The next train that goes through
Griboyedov is the Frunze one.

127
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,798
It will be here at 20:46.

128
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,116
But my ticket is in the train.

129
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,039
Will you pay 1 ruble 20 kopecks
or shall we draw up a report?

130
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,189
He looks like a decent man,
and won't pay for his lunch.

131
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,268
I see. Nikolasha, deal with it.
Vera, how about "Borzhomi"?

132
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,109
Everything's all right, I got five
bottles for you.

133
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,188
As for your ticket, come to me 15
minutes before the train's departure.

134
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,789
We'll think of something, we'll take
care of you.

135
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,117
And if he doesn't pay,
we're going to take care of him!

136
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,279
You'd better pay, filing a report
will cost you much more.

137
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:21,590
Here's three rubles for what
I haven't eaten. Keep the change.

138
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,199
- No, I don't need your change.
- That'll be your tip.

139
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,277
What if I never take tips?

140
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,199
I didn't know that.
Perhaps you never short-change either?

141
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,799
Perhaps.

142
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:39,271
Lieutenant, you'll be my witness
that I gave him his lousy change.

143
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,358
There. We're quits.

144
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,677
Hi, Petya!

145
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,959
Bitch!

146
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,629
Will you be so kind to tell me,
if it's not too much trouble to you,

147
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,593
which tables you're not serving,
so that I know where to sit.

148
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,799
Thank you very much.

149
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,880
Lyuda, take care of that comrade.

150
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,515
But first make him pay.

151
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,678
Take care of the comrade herself,
Shurik is here to see me.

152
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,794
Hi, Shurik!
Shurik, will you sing for us tonight?

153
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,958
I've prepared a new song.

154
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,196
Terrific! I'll look forward to it.

155
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,630
Come to your senses!

156
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,878
- What? Why?
- Doing it in broad daylight...

157
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,436
You're a shrew. I'll never in my life
eat anything from your hands.

158
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,436
Shurik, did I do anything to him?

159
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,676
If I were you, I'd kill him
with a tray.

160
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:06,872
Attention, students of Zastupinsk
Pedagogical Institute,

161
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,677
you can get your food vouchers
in Hall No.2.

162
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,278
Parents who lost their child in red
socks, come to the officer on duty.

163
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,959
Those who lost a child
in red socks,

164
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,515
come to the officer on duty now!

165
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,117
Give me the menu. Now!

166
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,797
Oh, where are your principles?

167
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,037
What about never eating
from my hands?

168
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,628
The refreshment bar is closed.

169
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,433
And you're hungry, aren't you?

170
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,597
I'm starving.

171
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,598
I didn't eat your ghastly borsht.
I hope you realize that now?

172
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,357
If you didn't eat it, how can
you know that it's ghastly?

173
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,879
I got so tired of you.
Bring me some diet food.

174
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,951
All right, since it's also my fault
that you got stuck here,

175
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,790
I'll serve you
as a dear guest of our city.

176
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,957
You know, we've been instructed

177
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,871
to take special care of new arrivals,
unlike those just passing through,

178
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,277
because our restaurant
is the calling card of our city.

179
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,437
From diet food we have only chicken.

180
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,429
Great. Please,
let me pay in advance.

181
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,109
- By all means.
- Because you can't trust me.

182
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,632
- And mineral water, please.
- All right, mineral water.

183
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,592
I couldn't feel worse.

184
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,593
I doubt that our chicken will lift
your spirits. Two rubles 78 kopecks.

185
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,796
Here.

186
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,119
Excuse me.

187
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,110
Passenger who lost his ticket
from Zastupinsk to Lvov,

188
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,517
please come to the information office.

189
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,950
Sima, the cutlets are burning!

190
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,035
Shurik!

191
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,358
- Some music for our guest, Shurik.
- Got it. Here it comes!

192
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,630
Bon appetite!

193
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,797
I'm stuck here thanks to you.

194
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,597
I wish your restaurant had burned, and
your station and your chicken, too!

195
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,274
Damn it!

196
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,516
- Is it stringy?
- Yes.

197
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,358
This chicken worked as a waitress in
your restaurant when it was alive.

198
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,518
- I see. It is as ghastly.
- You're absolutely right.

199
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,434
You have a band playing at night?

200
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,597
Sure. And it's very loud.

201
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,199
Did all your things go choo-choo
to Griboyedov without you?

202
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,677
No, all my things are with me.

203
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,039
I planned to stay there only two days.
Now I've lost one thanks to you.

204
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,789
You can't even imagine
how important is that day to me.

205
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,437
What's your name, Miss?

206
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,197
Just Miss. Just Miss.

207
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,518
An inaccessible miss,
especially for transit passengers.

208
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,514
I'm not going to storm
that inaccessible fortress.

209
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,677
Don't try to kid me. You're all alike.

210
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,872
What we were like when we just
started,

211
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,791
We're not the same, we've lost our
drive...

212
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,878
Vera, I almost forgot.
Run to the drugstore,

213
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,196
they got Yugoslavian shampoo.

214
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,510
The blue one. It makes
hair grow like crazy.

215
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,677
I took ten bottles.

216
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,354
What a fool.

217
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,349
If the investigator calls,
don't tell him where I am.

218
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,109
Invent something, but make him
believe you.

219
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,354
I'll be back in Moscow Monday morning.

220
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,356
What do I care about
when they deliver the fencing?

221
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,673
Stop eavesdropping.

222
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:29,437
I wasn't speaking to you. There's
one here, so disgusting.

223
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,433
How do you feel?

224
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,190
I won't be living in that dacha.
Now I'll live behind another fence.

225
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,598
Call my father in Griboyedov, tell
him I'll be there tomorrow morning.

226
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,357
Don't worry about me.

227
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,198
Sure, I'm great.

228
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,119
Kiss you.

229
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,437
What do you need so much shampoo for?
For lacing your customers' soup?

230
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,592
Good heavens... real barbarians!

231
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,797
For you I'd do it with pleasure.

232
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:09,032
Attention, delegates who have come
to the zoological conference.

233
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,949
The conference has been canceled.

234
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,791
You can get return tickets
at Ticket Office Number 2.

235
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,119
Gentleman in a checkered jacket,
remove your dog from track three!

236
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,190
I repeat, gentleman
in a checkered jacket!

237
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,200
Remove your dog
from track three!

238
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,199
- Did you see my tray?
- It's in the kitchen, in the corner.

239
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,194
All right.

240
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,959
Put the knives on the table.

241
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,030
- Everything's cold again.
- They'll eat it, they're in a hurry.

242
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,596
All right, we're coming!

243
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,434
Vera! My dear! Get ready!

244
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,798
I'm here!

245
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,234
Come on, move on!

246
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,593
Vera!

247
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,353
Vera, my dear!

248
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,194
Vera!

249
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,119
Andrei!

250
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,595
Climb over and come here!

251
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,591
- Why are you on the Tashkent train?
- It's summer, we're short of hands.

252
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,516
- I missed you so much!
- Me too!

253
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,074
- Shall we go?
- I can't, too many customers.

254
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,515
- Is Lyuda on duty today?
- Yes.

255
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,869
Lyuda, my sweetie!

256
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,038
Bon appetite, comrades!

257
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,629
Hi! Lyuda, can you...

258
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,356
Got it. I'll collect
from everyone. Thanks!

259
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,517
Vera, they may shorten our stop.

260
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,791
I just have to put it somewhere...

261
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,277
- What's that?
- Melons.

262
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,039
Tchaidzhui melons.

263
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,110
They're too heavy to drag them along.
We have to hide them here.

264
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,718
You know how much money they mean?

265
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,435
You know? You'll be amazed!

266
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:46,357
Buses are on the square
in front of the main entrance.

267
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,794
Dear artistes of Yerevan
Drama Theatre!

268
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,676
Welcome to our city!

269
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,669
The citizens of Zastupinsk
look forward to your performances.

270
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,197
Buses are on the square
in front of the main entrance.

271
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,948
Comrade.

272
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,674
- Hello.
- Hello.

273
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:14,799
- Are you going to sit here long?
- Till the evening.

274
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,433
Can you watch over my suitcases?

275
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,595
Why not?

276
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,039
You got a passport?

277
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,036
Yes.

278
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,276
- You have it with you?
- Yes.

279
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,153
Can I see it please?

280
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,674
Sure.

281
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,678
Look, watch over the suitcases.
There're Tchaidzhui melons in there.

282
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,269
You know how much they cost?
You'll be amazed!

283
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,120
If you watch them well,
I'll give you one.

284
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,029
Hey, what's your name... Give back
my passport! You have no right!

285
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,110
Watch them, man. You'll get back your
passport in ten minutes. You got it?

286
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,519
There's a pine tree on Shishkin's
painting...

287
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,798
What's the matter?
Nothing works.

288
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,677
Allrightie. Hush, hush...
Let's black it out. Wait.

289
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,629
Those cars are so old. I'm going to
write to the minister. Come on, Vera.

290
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,512
I missed you so much!

291
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,109
Come on, Vera, do it yourself. It's
not a restaurant. Self-service here.

292
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,789
We had a horrible night. Genka took on
two men without tickets in Penza.

293
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,799
He thought they were sober,
but they made such a racket!

294
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,359
One lay across the car, and here comes
an inspection. Genka got a toothache.

295
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,790
I say to him, "Take a shot of vodka."
And he says:

296
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,798
"A shot of vodka isn't a stop handle:
Once you take it, you never stop.

297
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,513
Why aren't you undressing?

298
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,116
I don't feel like it.

299
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,109
People don't do it like that,
all in a hurry.

300
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,278
We can't help it, Vera. All our life
is in a hurry. Come on.

301
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,632
What I'm dreaming of is
for you to come for a whole week.

302
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,596
We two could go out, go to the movies,
like normal people.

303
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,515
Is it really my fault, Vera?
My whole life is on wheels.

304
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,797
I know, honey.

305
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,949
I'm on wheels, you're with a tray.
What can we do? Take off your clothes.

306
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,030
I can't. I don't know what's
the matter with me. I just can't.

307
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,957
Maybe you don't love me?

308
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,354
I do.

309
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,355
Vera, don't be a teaser.

310
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,199
Come on, take off your clothes,
please, they'll shorten the stop.

311
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,358
I can't do it in a compartment!
I don't feel like it.

312
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,630
Come on, stop it!
I'm not a boy, am I?

313
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,638
I'm not a young girl either.

314
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,798
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
Why are you being so cruel?

315
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,958
I've been suffering since Tashkent.
Come on, Vera, stop it.

316
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,597
I can't and that's it!

317
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,275
I want it to be nice!

318
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,439
They did shorten it! We couldn't
have done it anyway. Oh, shit...

319
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,518
Stops are shortened.
No personal life for a man.

320
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,110
- Well, I must go.
- Wait, wait.

321
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,675
Let me give you a kiss.

322
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,790
Good. See you the day after tomorrow?

323
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,035
All right.

324
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,994
I'm going to write to the minister!

325
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,037
I'll be here the day after tomorrow
at 12:10, if the train is not late.

326
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,437
Get ready, Vera!

327
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,199
The Tchaidzhui melons are three
rubles a kilo, don't forget!

328
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,029
What's the matter? We just sat down.

329
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,592
He put salt in his borsht and never
touched it.

330
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,596
Your melons are safe and sound.

331
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,189
I took this one for guarding them,
as we have agreed.

332
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,800
What are you going to do
with such a horde of melons?

333
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,799
Convert them into money.

334
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,275
For three rubles?

335
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,274
A kilo.

336
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,596
Give me my passport, please.

337
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,119
Oh, your passport went choo-choo
to Moscow.

338
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,114
It's not the time forjoking.

339
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,198
It's not a joke. Why did you give it
to him in the first place?

340
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,950
A man in a uniform demanded
my passport. So I gave it to him.

341
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,110
You see, when we were in
a compartment, we had an argument.

342
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,960
After that we had no time
to think about your passport.

343
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:15,199
You have ruined my whole life!
You, skinny alley cat!

344
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,799
Why are you insulting me?

345
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,958
And what if your snub-nosed bully
will hand it over to the police?

346
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,949
You're snub-nosed yourself!
Andrei is a good man.

347
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,195
He's a profiteer.

348
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,632
Profiteers can be good men, too.
Petya, take it to the luggage locker.

349
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,114
What am I going to do without
a passport?

350
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,277
- Calm down.
- After all this...

351
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:37,599
Listen to me carefully.
The day after tomorrow, at 12:10,

352
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,198
yes, exactly at 12:10,
Andrei will deliver your passport.

353
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,789
And you'll leave by the train you
have missed.

354
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,274
Once again, I'm sorry.

355
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,950
I have to see my father. Maybe
it will be for the last time.

356
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,279
Passenger who lost his ticket,
come to the information office.

357
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,792
Come on, don't panic.
You can go there today,

358
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,595
and on your way back I'll bring
your passport right to your car.

359
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,630
I'll have to go back by plane,
otherwise I'll be late.

360
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,957
No one will fire you
if you're one day late.

361
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,869
You've finished me off. What am I
to do? I can't wait and I can't go.

362
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,198
What ever have you done?

363
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,596
Robbed the State Bank of the USSR!

364
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,876
Oh God, how clever!

365
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,435
Good afternoon.

366
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,189
If you could name
a lucky station for me,

367
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,029
I think I would buy a ticket
and go there for the rest of my life.

368
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,673
You drunkards give us no peace.

369
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,111
Do you want me to give you a glass
too? I'm sick and tired of you!

370
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,153
Thanks for not hitting me.

371
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,714
Raya!

372
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,675
Masha, it's me. What's new?

373
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,354
Did he work, or was he retired?

374
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,676
Did they get the results of forensic
examination?

375
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,314
I'm still having that nightmare
before my eyes.

376
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,438
I'm even glad that it's only me.
I don't want you to worry.

377
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,514
They delivered the fencing?
Then everything is all right.

378
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,519
When are you on the air? Tomorrow?
Did you call my father?

379
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,788
Call him and tell him I'll be there
the day after tomorrow in the evening.

380
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:41,675
Why, why... Itjust so happened.
It's a long story.

381
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,515
All right. That's my last coin.

382
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,798
Will you stop spying on me?

383
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,798
I'm not spying, just the other way
round.

384
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,189
I let you down, and I must help you
somehow, but I... got confused.

385
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,516
Have you done something awful?

386
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,677
A man died because of me.

387
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,190
It was an accident, but I'm to blame.

388
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,116
Tell me, how did it happen?

389
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,790
Will you please forgive me?

390
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,037
I don't even know why I was
pestering you with that ruble.

391
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,517
You can go wild from this work.
They yell at you, you yell back.

392
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,277
They underpay, you short-change.

393
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,792
Forget it, you didn't mean it,
you did it in the heat of the moment.

394
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,439
I understand. I hold nothing against
you.

395
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,789
You mean it?

396
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,358
Why should I lie to you?
Goodbye.

397
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,278
Sorry again.

398
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,439
- The restaurant is full.
- I want to see Vera, the waitress.

399
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,597
Vera? Our Vera? Come in.

400
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,358
We no longer live, just ramble

401
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,039
Monotonously, like in paradise.

402
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,878
Don't ever be afraid to gamble

403
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,514
And stake your whole life on dice.

404
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,588
How good we were when we just started!

405
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,790
We're not the same, we've lost our
drive.

406
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,109
It's never late to go and chance it.

407
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,594
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid,

408
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,518
Don't be afraid to change your life!

409
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,354
What if your hair's touched with
white,

410
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,118
It's never late to choose new roads.

411
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,878
To stake it all have no fright,

412
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,154
Cast off yourself your past life loads.

413
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,359
Going out in a rainy weather,

414
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,675
Stir up your spirits and your
shoulders unbend.

415
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,869
Don't be afraid of a new endeavor,

416
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:23,950
And over life, and over life
Just try to get an upper hand!

417
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,597
Believe in chimeras, mystification.

418
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,879
Of your belongings you'll need none.

419
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,792
Only death's your final destination.

420
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,199
Just try to have your life redone!

421
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,190
Don't ever hide, have no pity

422
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,277
If no trump card there's to throw in.

423
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,834
Your own guilt contribute in the kitty.

424
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,429
Who never loses, he will never win!
Who never loses, he will never win!

425
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,631
Waiter! Bring more vodka!

426
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,592
I'm not a waiter, I'm a girl.

427
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,115
I'm telling you as a girl, I haven't
had enough.

428
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,631
And I'm asking you nicely,
pay up and go home.

429
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,798
I don't know anybody but you in this
city. What am I to do?

430
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,436
I visited the monastery, I sat
at the movies. It's raining outside.

431
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,790
They won't let me into the hotel
without a passport.

432
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,958
I understand. I'll think later
where I can put you up...

433
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,790
Let's wish the newlyweds a long and
happy life. Kiss the bride!

434
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,879
Thank you.

435
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,638
I remember everything.

436
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,038
Please, I'm begging you,
pay for your dinner and go home.

437
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,039
- Waiter...
- Or I'm going to cry.

438
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,870
Don't cry, pal.
How much do I owe you?

439
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,672
You dropped your pencil.

440
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,354
Twenty one.

441
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,949
Take whatever you need. I trust you.

442
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,356
I've served them the main dish.
Shall I order coffee?

443
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,949
Hey, boy, not so loud!

444
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,959
- Shall I order coffee?
- Six teas, fifteen coffees.

445
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,798
Stop singing, I said.

446
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,273
Hurry up.

447
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,358
How much did you take?
Have an extra five.

448
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,278
It's too much. You got a family?

449
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,438
I got everything:
A wife, two kids and a dog.

450
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,073
Then I'll take one ruble.

451
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,959
One ruble isn't enough. You've got
an unhealthy job. Take three.

452
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,188
All right, I'll take two.
Easy, easy. Thanks.

453
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,358
Here, hide it or you'll lose it.

454
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,798
Get up, your family must be worrying.
You can finish your song at home.

455
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,433
Sure, like hell they worry!

456
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,234
Come on, boy. Will you find your way?

457
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,790
Don't insult me, waiter.

458
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,115
Go on, boy.

459
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,597
- Switching on cruise control.
- Yes, switch it on.

460
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,429
No, no jellied meat. It will melt.
I won't get it home intact.

461
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,599
I will. Stop grumbling.
Vera, ciao!

462
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,269
Goodbye, Shurik.
Thank you for the song, dear.

463
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,437
The song is as good as the cuisine.

464
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,438
That's it.

465
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,279
Let's go. I'll have you
accommodated with all conveniences.

466
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,196
I feel so tired.

467
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,109
Excuse me, but why did you leave
Moscow? Are you hiding?

468
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,198
My old father, I wanted to see him
before the trial.

469
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,799
Oh, how I'm cursing myself!

470
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:40,356
I wanted to explain it to him.
I had no right to leave Moscow.

471
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,039
What if the investigator calls me up?

472
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,198
- Just lie you've lost your passport.
- I'm not accustomed to it.

473
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:49,792
I signed a recognizance not to leave
Moscow and lost my passport here.

474
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,358
What kind of occupation you got
that you can do without lying?

475
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:57,356
I'm a pianist.
In an orchestra.

476
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,678
I'm always on the move.
Tours, concerts, hotels.

477
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,869
I'll put you up first class
and then I'll go home.

478
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,438
I'm afraid our ideas of first class
accommodation are not the same.

479
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:18,595
I hope you won't object to
the "Intourist" VIP lounge?

480
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,959
I haven't seen you for ages.

481
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,279
My life is so hectic, I'm getting
married. So, a lot of complications.

482
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,355
The wedding's on Thursday. Will you
come?

483
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,631
If you're inviting me. You made up
your mind about the bridegroom?

484
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,198
- Not yet.
- How come?

485
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,517
Hi. As of today,
I have two bridegrooms.

486
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,432
Yes, two bridegrooms.

487
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,269
Yeah. Petka and Mitka.
Petka is such a... Well, you know.

488
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,437
He's a great guy.

489
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,029
He makes a lot of money, but he hits
the bottle.

490
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,434
Mitka doesn't drink that much.

491
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,119
He's a good guy, too.

492
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,793
But he doesn't make that much money
either.

493
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:04,039
They live in different districts,
so I applied to different registries.

494
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:07,437
Can you imagine, Vera?
Two weddings, and both on Thursday.

495
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,438
It can happen only in our country!

496
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,434
Couldn't you find a non-drinking man?

497
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,598
What are you talking about?
Where can you find them in our days?

498
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,879
Marina, we need to put up
this man for the night.

499
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,798
I did him a very bad service.

500
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,790
Please, do it for me.

501
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,800
I've never asked you for anything
before.

502
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:44,959
Are you crazy? Only foreigners
are allowed here.

503
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,790
But you got no one here right now.

504
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:51,356
And what if some Dutchman or
Japanese suddenly arrive? No!

505
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:55,030
He's a pianist, a music competition
prizewinner.

506
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,595
We get those prizewinners a dime
a dozen in here.

507
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,516
But I'm an international prizewinner,
almost like a Japanese.

508
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,795
Do you want me to be fired?

509
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,039
If they know I let in here one of
ours, it'll be a scandal!

510
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,111
And what I did to get thatjob,
I don't even want to remember it. No!

511
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,798
Well, there's nothing we can do.
Goodbye.

512
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,360
I'll see you to your bus.

513
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,029
All right. And where will you go?

514
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,039
I'll stay here.

515
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,198
Actually, if we get to think of it,
all our life is one big waiting-room.

516
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,120
Don't be so depressed, you're going
to be acquitted.

517
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,198
Can't I go to your place?
You could put me up in the hall.

518
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,357
Bringing home a man? Are you crazy?

519
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,868
Are you married?

520
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,038
No, I turned my husband out
three years ago.

521
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:49,436
I have a son, we live
with my ex's parents.

522
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:53,952
A fabulous carburetor for a Volga.
Costs 70 at a store, you get it for 5.

523
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,869
- Lay off, boy.
- Got it.

524
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,038
Sorry for you. Living with someone
else's parents, especially you ex's.

525
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,668
Don't be, they're very close to me.
They're exceptional people.

526
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,030
You know, they've taken my side.
Can you imagine?

527
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,797
Wait!

528
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,675
Shit!

529
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,515
That's what you get when you're being
kind to people. It was the last bus.

530
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,798
- Let me take you home in a taxi.
- I can go in a taxi myself.

531
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,028
But they refuse to go to our place.
We live on the very outskirts.

532
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,275
My father-in-law is a trackman.

533
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,278
Will they worry?

534
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,437
Of course they will.

535
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,949
Well, I'll have to spend the night
at the station, it can't be helped.

536
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,434
Where are you going now?

537
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,590
First I'll get in touch with my folks
on intercom, then I'll see.

538
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,116
Perhaps they'll let you in
the restaurant?

539
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,278
No, they seal the restaurant up,
there're provisions in there.

540
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,629
Oh, I forgot the most important thing.
I forgot to pay you my debt.

541
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,194
What for?

542
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,789
For the lunch, one ruble 20 kopecks.

543
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,275
I think you really didn't eat that
borsht.

544
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,632
- I really didn't eat it.
- So I'm returning it. Goodbye.

545
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,114
Goodbye.

546
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,788
Dear passengers, an old woman with
no documents has been found.

547
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,438
Relatives or whoever accompanies her,
please come to the police office.

548
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,113
Dear passengers, an old woman with
no documents has been found.

549
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:24,033
Relatives or whoever accompanies her,
please come to the police office.

550
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,199
- Damn!
- Sorry.

551
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,274
What?

552
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,593
You can sit here.

553
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,958
- There's enough room for both.
- Thank you.

554
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,514
I think the owners won't mind.

555
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,948
There we go!

556
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,512
You can get bruised on this bench.

557
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:00,951
This way, just a little bit.
I'm sorry. Just like this.

558
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,199
I'll move you a bit.
Sorry. Fine. Thanks.

559
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,834
Just a little bit. Good. Thanks.

560
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,597
No, I can't do like this.
I'll move you a bit... Sorry.

561
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,038
Just a little bit, or I'll fall down.
Now it's good.

562
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,195
Oh, God!

563
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:34,269
As I think that tomorrow I'll have to
deal with the melons, I wish to die.

564
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:38,197
- At last our wishes coincided.
- It's no big deal for you.

565
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,199
Everything will be all right with you.
You'll be playing your piano again.

566
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,197
- In a prison amateur contest?
- Someone will help you out.

567
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,959
I'm not a soloist.

568
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,032
And not a prizewinner either.
Just playing to someone's baton.

569
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,276
It's better than carrying trays.

570
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,030
When I was left alone, with no husband

571
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,515
and no profession, with a child on
my hands...

572
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,439
But now it's all right. I work like
God.

573
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:14,670
You know, when I lie down at night,
after a hard day's work,

574
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:20,430
everything starts to spin before my
eyes: Trays, trains,

575
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,515
customers, passengers.

576
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,878
It's so awful! But I survive.

577
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,599
I'm hungry. It smells so good
from your bag.

578
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:38,435
You know, I haven't had a crumb
for the whole day.

579
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,434
- You know what? Let's eat.
- All right.

580
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,669
Well, let's see what I've got today.
Give me a hand.

581
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:53,394
What do we waitresses usually get?
Only garnish.

582
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:57,679
What the customers leave on their
plates. But we give it to pigs.

583
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,870
The kitchen never shares with us.
They work only for themselves.

584
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,196
And when do we have our lucky night?

585
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,871
When there's a big party like today's.
I served a wedding today.

586
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,638
I know, I saw it.

587
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,798
- Be my guest.
- Well, I feel...

588
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,792
It's the first time I have to eat
leavings.

589
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,958
Don't say that.

590
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,434
It's not leavings, it's leftovers.

591
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,199
It's a big difference.

592
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,870
- You mean no one ate...
- You're insulting me, client.

593
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,790
Well, in my position it's foolish to
be too fastidious.

594
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,877
You're right. Help yourself.

595
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,674
Well?

596
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,958
- And you say, leavings, scraps...
- A very tasty wedding.

597
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,198
Just a minute. Please.

598
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,197
Thank you. What a strange night.

599
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,798
It's funny. Who am I at that wedding?
The bridegroom? A guest?

600
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,794
No. I think
I'm just a sponger.

601
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,037
Why?
You'll be the bride.

602
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,037
In that case you're the bridegroom.

603
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,353
The bridegroom?!

604
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,194
I'm the bridegroom!

605
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,792
Why is this unusual reaction?
I didn't say anything funny.

606
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,355
My dear girl, what do you want me
to put on your plate?

607
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,790
Give me, my dear boy, an olive
and a piece of salami.

608
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,036
- There you go.
- My darling...

609
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:55,269
Here, my baby, some olives,
and butter, and fish...

610
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,788
I want some fish.

611
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,514
- There you go, baby.
- My silly darling.

612
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,518
Oh, what idiots we are!

613
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,115
Caviar!

614
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,358
It was near the bridegroom. He didn't
eat anything, he just drank.

615
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,868
You took it right from the table?

616
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,599
My dear friends! To you!

617
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,834
Thank you for coming
to this wonderful wedding!

618
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,520
Baby, I didn't know you're
a drinking man! Get ready!

619
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,948
But there're no glasses.

620
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,196
Then we'll have to drink from
the bottle.

621
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,038
You first.

622
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,951
My dear passengers!
I wish to drink to you!

623
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:51,113
I hope you'll get your tickets and
arrive in time at your destination.

624
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,035
Good!

625
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,629
- Leave something for me.
- Sure.

626
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:00,629
I also want to propose a toast.
I wish to drink to you!

627
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,356
Because you're not a bad person.

628
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,630
Well, you understand everything.

629
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:07,955
Your health!

630
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,200
- The champagne is sweet.
- Freebies are always sweet.

631
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,519
How much money was there?

632
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,588
Damn your bandit's city!
Why do I have only bad luck?

633
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,798
They've robbed me of 200 rubles,
just a few kopecks left.

634
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:46,196
I'm in a really bad spot. Being under
investigation, missing my train!

635
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,789
My passport is gone, my money stolen.

636
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,798
But I had a ball at the wedding.

637
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:54,516
Take it easy, pianist.
You can call your wife in Moscow.

638
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,678
She'll send you money if she
hasn't spent it all on fencing.

639
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,190
I need a passport to be paid on
the money order.

640
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,358
You'll get your passport tomorrow
at 12:10, didn't I tell you that?

641
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,790
If your conductor hasn't lost it.

642
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:11,154
He won't lose it, he's a businessman.
He's got brains in his head.

643
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,188
Sure, businessmen, business
contacts, business meetings.

644
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,631
I can imagine what kind of a business
meeting you had in a compartment.

645
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,276
Yes, you're right, we had a business
meeting in a compartment.

646
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,436
If you had a business meeting,

647
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,632
then we two are just
frolicking in a bed here.

648
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,514
Don't even count on it.

649
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,437
You know, I don't squander
myself on trifles.

650
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,511
Sure, melons for three rubles a kilo,
it's not a trifle.

651
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,271
All right, let me explain it to you
and make everything absolutely clear.

652
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,914
I'll get only 50 kopecks from every
kilo.

653
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,676
Andrei gets a ruble and a half,
and I think it's fair.

654
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,790
He buys them in Tashkent
for 50 kopecks a kilo.

655
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:04,518
The remaining ruble goes to a second-
hand dealer, because he's a farmer.

656
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,033
I've earned myself a radiculutis
on the apples. I can't move.

657
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,790
Uncle Misha, my dear!
These are Tchaidzhui melons.

658
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:15,957
In this hot weather they'll perish.

659
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,798
Why uncle? You're an aunt.

660
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,356
Uncle Misha was my late husband.

661
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,878
He was in this business, he helped
people earn a kopeck or two.

662
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,878
He was a man of authority.

663
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,948
And I sort of
taken a baton from him.

664
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,958
No, 7 is much too much.
I'll take it for 6 rubles.

665
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,959
I've got company. Bring it later.

666
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:46,675
Then... he got under a freighty at night.

667
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,873
- Under what?
- A freight train. He was drunk.

668
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,195
Now they call me Uncle Misha.

669
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,799
And I'm proud of it.

670
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:02,029
What shall we do with the melons,
Uncle Misha?

671
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,196
Good for you, Vera! I solidarize
with your concern.

672
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,791
We can't leave people without
vitamins.

673
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,038
Now I understand your vocation.
You take care of people's health.

674
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,119
Don't be so sarcastic.

675
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:20,118
We'll have to see yet who takes more
care of the people, me or them.

676
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,594
Who "them"?

677
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,438
Have you ever seen the fruits
they sell at stores?

678
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,598
Their fruits and vegetables
are no good.

679
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,597
I feed the people with good produce,
and what about those state shops?

680
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:38,279
Their watermelons are unripe,
tomatoes stale, pears wooden.

681
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:43,357
And I nurse each berry
like a small baby!

682
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,755
It's true.

683
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,597
Those warehouses don't know how
to keep produce.

684
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,629
Neither fruits, nor vegetables,
nor berries!

685
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,434
And that's so because it belongs to
nobody!

686
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,678
- And who are you?
- Nobody, I guess.

687
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,196
No documents and no money.

688
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:04,790
He's a passenger, left behind his
train.

689
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,792
So let's put
an Uzbek cap on him,

690
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,197
and he'll be selling the melons
like a farmer from Central Asia.

691
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,516
- Selling?
- Me?

692
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,276
What are you talking about? I never
sold anything and am not going to!

693
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:23,269
It's easy. Just think of how they sell
at stores and do the other way round.

694
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,798
They're rude there, and you smile.

695
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,275
They cheat with the weight,
you give them extra.

696
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,595
What?

697
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,869
Give them 50 or 100 grams more,
and the customer will be pleased.

698
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,632
- You know, they sell wet vegetables.
- Why?

699
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,199
- Were you just born?
- Well, he doesn't know life at all.

700
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,879
To make them heavier.

701
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,116
So that they weigh more, understand?

702
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,630
And your melon will be dry and nice.

703
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,790
I'll give a call to the manager, so
that instead of giving you a thrashing

704
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,196
he'd give you a robe, a scale...

705
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,358
I'm not going to sell them.
Let Vera do it.

706
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,639
I can't show myself at the market
place, I work in the service sector.

707
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,273
And I'm a musician.

708
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,039
So you can trade with music.

709
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,039
Oh, I forgot, he's an international
competition prizewinner.

710
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,791
I could become one if they
had sent me there at least once.

711
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,799
You can be sure they'll send you
somewhere at the market.

712
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,031
No, I'm not going to trade.

713
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,515
Why do you refuse to help me out?

714
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:28,435
I don't want to profiteer and I won't.

715
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,871
Oh, that's what you hold us for?
I'm not a profiteer!

716
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,675
We're intermediaries between
the earth and the people.

717
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:40,430
And you're being entrusted with
an important, honorable mission.

718
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,597
Please spare me!

719
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,798
- He's ashamed.
- Yes, I'm ashamed! And afraid!

720
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:51,358
Fourteen rubles, please.
The melon's yours, the money's ours.

721
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,799
Come, folks! There's nothing phony!
It's half sugar, half honey!

722
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,517
- This one, please.
- You've chosen a fine melon!

723
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,789
Twelve rubles, please.
Come, folks! There's nothing phony!

724
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,278
Buy a melon, please.

725
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,118
It melts in your mouth!

726
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,956
Please, comrade...

727
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,039
- He's got no shame.
- The intelligentsia.

728
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,799
Those parasites give us no peace!

729
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,798
I wish you'd choke on your melon!

730
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,638
They know no limits!

731
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:31,118
Fifteen rubles for a melon!
Because of you we can't buy anything.

732
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,515
Scavenger!

733
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,950
Profiteer!

734
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:37,674
Why it's 3 rubles here and 2.50 over
there?

735
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,437
He doesn't want to work, parasite!

736
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,277
He's a sponger,
just look at his hands.

737
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,677
He's never seen a melon plantation
in his life.

738
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,439
It's outrageous!

739
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,790
Gorged himself a mug at the expense
of our temporal difficulties.

740
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:55,517
Why are you attacking the man?
You don't like it, don't buy it.

741
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,279
What's that smell?

742
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:02,793
- It's the Tchaidzui melon.
- Great. Have one weighed for me.

743
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,039
As for the mug, I would advise you
to look in the mirror more often.

744
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:08,799
What a bitch!

745
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:13,598
They insult us at the shops, you come
here to get a break, it's the same.

746
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,437
That comrade has good melons too,
only they're bitter.

747
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,789
Have you tasted them?

748
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,878
I don't need to taste them.
I know that kind very well.

749
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,438
- Have you been inside it?
- I know that variety.

750
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,039
I'll cut it for you to taste.

751
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,436
Don't bother. I know it all through.

752
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,597
I'll deal with them all.

753
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,672
Thanks for coming.

754
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,516
I know. She's his woman. Yes.

755
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,597
She works for him.

756
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,197
Come on. I've never seen him before.

757
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,629
They're second-hand dealers.

758
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,592
It's the first time I'm seeing him!

759
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:52,199
She's not my woman!

760
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,433
I've got a certificate!

761
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,039
She's not my woman.

762
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,834
A certificate from my own plot,
that's why I sell cheaper.

763
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,789
You're a second-hand dealer yourself!
You think your tomatoes grow on trees?

764
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:05,640
It's your melons
that grow on trees!

765
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,958
Come on, what's so funny?
The man's just kidding.

766
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,357
You'd better go, baldie,
and watch your worm-eaten tomatoes.

767
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,349
What the hell is going on? You can't
get away from those city swindlers!

768
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:21,349
- I bet he bought them from conductors.
- That's why he overprices them!

769
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,119
Call the police!

770
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,799
I'll be a witness!

771
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,436
- No police, friends!
- He's right.

772
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,030
The police are no chums to us. Let's
just give him a couple of punches.

773
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,438
Good people!
That's my debut at the market place!

774
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,197
Perhaps it's not quite a success.
Please, help me.

775
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:44,596
Help me to get rid of those damned
melons.

776
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,879
Help me,
buy them by the barrel.

777
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,514
I mean, by the bulk, all together.

778
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,515
Hurry up, baldie, it's a bargain.

779
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,639
I pay a ruble a kilo for the lot.

780
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,198
No way. For a ruble a kilo,
he'll eat them himself, right?

781
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,630
For a ruble a kilo, I'll eat them
myself.

782
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:07,115
All right, one ruble 20 kopecks.

783
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,356
No, it's robbery!

784
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,790
- One ruble 30 kopecks.
- No!

785
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,433
One ruble 40 kopecks. That's my last
word.

786
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,871
No, I can't, I must return to my boss
one ruble 50 kopecks.

787
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,958
We gave you a good price.

788
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:28,519
You can't lose on it, it's a bargain!
Don't be stingy, sellers!

789
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:34,871
Oh, what the heck!
Who wants Tchaidzhui melons?

790
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,358
As sweet as honey!
As smooth as maidens!

791
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,797
Come on, buy before they go!

792
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,789
Come, folks, there's nothing phony!
They're half sugar, half honey!

793
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,957
One ruble fifty a kilo!

794
00:59:58,320 --> 00:59:59,355
Please.

795
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,598
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Where to?

796
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:05,195
This way. It's not far.

797
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,790
It feels so good!

798
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,513
Right.

799
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,435
After all that smoke and racket at
the restaurant,

800
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,030
I come here at night, get some fresh
air, and all is gone without a trace.

801
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,515
Aren't you afraid to walk alone at
night?

802
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,358
I'm used to it.

803
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,200
My friend, Violetta, often comes
along to visit me.

804
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:29,234
We two walk, with heavy bags,

805
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,790
so tired that we can't even talk,
just chap-chap-chap.

806
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,200
And, suddenly, we hear
a man's cough behind us.

807
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,431
And my dear old maid, Violetta,
immediately became a different person.

808
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,437
Now she was walking with no life left
in her, with her whole body aching...

809
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,438
Imagine, she gave him her phone
number, and waited, with no result.

810
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,038
Though it seemed that man was already
in her pocket.

811
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,598
You needn't to go with me any farther.
Thanks and goodbye.

812
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,797
How can you sleep with that thunder?

813
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:17,198
I got used to it. Now I can't
sleep when it's quiet.

814
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,994
I need that thunder around me.

815
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:23,116
That territory by the tracks...

816
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:27,518
Our house is over there... we call it
"a strip of estrangement".

817
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:30,519
All right... I must go.

818
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:33,792
I haven't yet asked you that most
original question men usually ask.

819
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:36,957
What are you doing tonight?

820
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,195
Are you inviting me to the station's
waiting room?

821
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,357
Oh no, you have such a beautiful
dress on!

822
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,518
I got even a better one!

823
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:49,436
Then it's only natural that I should
invite you to a restaurant tonight.

824
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,028
Oh, please, invite me. I haven't
been to a restaurant for ages!

825
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,279
I'm inviting you.

826
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,039
I'll be back in a jiffy!

827
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,433
Here I am.

828
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:16,437
I gave them their supper, said I'd be
back late, so we can go and party.

829
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,115
Please.

830
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,955
Wait...

831
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,798
You want to offer me money?

832
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,438
- The gentleman is supposed to pay.
- Whatjoint are we going to?

833
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,508
If you don't mind, invite me
to our restaurant, please.

834
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,437
- You want to show off?
- I want to see their long faces.

835
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:40,638
Keep your money.

836
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,195
You mean we're going to run away
without paying?

837
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,358
I know that you think I'm a criminal,
and perhaps you're right.

838
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,718
But this time
we'll act honest.

839
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,116
How? I'm intrigued.

840
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,120
It's a secret.
Actually, I'm a very mysterious man.

841
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,360
Oh, you're so funny!

842
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,631
Will you buy me a ticket, please?
I haven't got a kopeck.

843
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,876
Of course I will. I've got a season
ticket.

844
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,834
End of Part One
