1
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:17,270
A state of emergency has been declared
throughout the country.

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:26,559
The articles affecting freedom of speech,
freedom of residence,

3
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:30,589
freedom of association,
and habeas corpus,

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,029
have been suspended.

00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,391
MADRlD, JANUARY 1970

6
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,196
Move your arse!

7
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,309
Minority actions,

8
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,831
systematically carried out in order to
disturb public order in Spain,

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,395
have been occurring in recent months

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,078
and are obviously

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,430
part ofan international plot.

12
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,234
The defence ofpeace
and progress in Spain,

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,431
and ofthe rights ofSpaniards,

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,910
as desired by all sectors ofsociety,

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,112
obliges the Government
to take urgent measures

16
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,278
which will put an end to these outbreaks.

17
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,278
Therefore, invoking the powers
set out by law,

18
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,516
in particular those contained

19
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,676
in the following articles...

20
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,836
- Dona Centro, what's up?
- You get back to work. l'll see to it.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,910
Centro!

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,554
Don't shout - you'll wake the whole street.

23
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,114
l feel awful!

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,513
- Like my guts are scrambled.
- Don't exaggerate.

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,070
Christ!

26
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,189
- What?
- Nothing.

27
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,630
You weren't exaggerating. Far from it.

28
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,270
Get up, love, you're in labour.
We have to get you dressed.

29
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,029
lsabelita, you really put one over on me.

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,312
When you came to this house,
you weren't exactly alone.

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,155
Be careful. Come on, that's it.

32
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,871
Wait, l have to close the door!

33
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,709
Take it slowly.

34
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,993
Going into labour tonight!
You might have warned me.

35
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,310
- How was l to know?
- Well, if you didn't...

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,273
- But l can't count.
- lgnorance! What a terrible thing!

37
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,268
Stop! Stop!

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,910
Bastard!

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,193
Come on, lean here.

40
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,670
Careful.

41
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,590
Stop!

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,353
Centro, for God's sake!

43
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,353
Stop! Stop, dammit!

44
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,754
Fucking hell!

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,319
Now, don't worry.

46
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,910
Come on, love, hurry. Hurry.

47
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,558
Are you crazy, or what?
l could have killed you!

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,478
These high heels will kill me.

49
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,753
You can't get on.
l'm going back to the depot now.

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,313
My friend's in labour.

51
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,678
What do you want me to do?

52
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,272
l told you not to get on.

53
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,879
Sit down there, love.

54
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,271
Don't do this. Please, get off.

55
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,552
You don't have to adopt the baby!
Just get us to a hospital!

56
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,475
But l'm off duty.
Don't you understand?

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,838
Senora, it isn't my bus.

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,351
Take it easy, hang on!
Close your legs! Breathe!

59
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,069
Fuck! 30,000 drivers in Madrid
and it happens to me!

60
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,432
Now don't cry!

61
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,350
lf idiots like us didn't decide
to give birth occasionally,

62
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,359
the world would be empty,
or full of old people.

63
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,110
See? The cologne cools you down.

64
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,750
- lt's falling.
- Press your legs together.

65
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,428
l mean the angel.

66
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,197
lt looks like it's going to jump.

67
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,634
As if the poor thing wanted to kill itself.

68
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,794
l've wet myself.

69
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,677
No, it isn't that, love.
You've broken your waters.

70
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,839
Stop, please!
My friend's broken her waters!

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,635
l'll park where we won't be in the way!

72
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,076
Put your legs up here.

73
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,555
That's it. Now the other one.

74
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,988
Take it easy.

75
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,152
Don't worry, l'm with you.

76
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,829
Let's go for it.

77
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,428
Come on, that's it.

78
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,596
Push! Push! Push!

79
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,315
Keep going!

80
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,073
That's good!

81
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,589
Very good! Keep going!

82
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,750
Good!

83
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,837
Push! Push! Push!

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,831
Driver! Come and help me!

85
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,836
Push!

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,675
Keep going!

87
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,271
That's it! There it is!

88
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,759
lt's a boy!

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,235
And he's really noisy, eh?

90
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,957
Just what we need!

91
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,198
First of all, we have to tie the cord.

92
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,709
Have you got anything
to tie the umbilical cord?

93
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,479
l know, your shoelaces.
Give them to me.

94
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,952
You did really well.

95
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,519
Does he have everything?

96
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,312
Everything? This kid's got it all!

97
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,238
Your other shoelace.

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,756
And now we have to cut the cord.

99
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,633
Have you got any scissors?
Anything to cut with?

100
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,711
- No, no.
- God, you've got nothing!

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,471
l know! l'll cut it with my teeth.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,554
This doesn't hurt.

103
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,908
Give me a cloth for the baby.

104
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,395
- Poor little thing.
- Here, take this.

105
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,510
My baby!

106
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,310
There he is now! There's your baby!

107
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,078
My baby!

108
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,872
Aren't you beautiful!

109
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,394
Now where do we go?

110
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,910
To the hospital. She's in no shape
to come home with me.

111
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,877
Hold him tight. You're very weak.
Don't drop him.

112
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,550
You mustn't fall asleep.

113
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,359
Careful, we're moving.

114
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,678
You can't go to sleep.
Look at how beautiful he is.

115
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,111
The pains have started again!

116
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,879
That's the placenta.

117
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,715
Give me the baby.

118
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,754
You have to push again.

119
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,915
Again?

120
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,238
You have to get it all out.

121
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,919
Come on, love. Push.

122
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,876
Hurry up, this woman's bleeding!

123
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,274
We're on our way!

124
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,791
Rest for a while.

125
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,037
You couldn't wait, could you?

126
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,831
You were in a big hurry
to get to Madrid, and here you are.

127
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,315
- What are you going to call him?
- Victor.

128
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,829
Look, Victor.

129
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,510
Madrid!

130
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,516
LlVE FLESH

131
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,993
ln the heart ofMadrid,
defying the harsh weather,

132
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,948
a young woman has given birth
inside a city bus.

133
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,314
The news ofthis unexpected birth

134
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,995
has been greeted with delight.

135
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,909
The mayorpresented the baby
with his first layette

136
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,797
and made him an honorary citizen.

137
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,796
The director ofthe city transport company

138
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,638
was not to be outdone,

139
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,713
and, accompanied by the chiefcouncillor

140
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,876
and their respective wives,

141
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,071
presented the mother and son

142
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,077
with lifetime passes

143
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,510
which entitle them to free use

144
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,111
of the bus service.

145
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,795
With such enviable prospects,

146
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,033
we can assure the impatient young man

147
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,151
a ''life on wheels''.

148
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,072
20 YEARS LATER

149
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,277
Down in the Coto Donana
they've killed...

150
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,794
They've killed my dog.

151
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,112
A deer among the green rockrose,

152
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,748
he was following.

153
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,676
Throughout all ofAndalusia

154
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,588
you'll never find another dog like my dog.

155
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,070
Dogs! That's how they treat us
and that's what we are.

156
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,755
Dogs.

157
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,835
Look at the lambs we have to protect.

158
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,031
He was so happy when he returned.

159
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,912
He took such care

160
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,313
bringing my flock back to me.

161
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,838
He was the key to my farm,

162
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,192
and the guardian ofmy flocks.

163
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,158
There wasn't a wolfthat would come near

164
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,477
the lambs on the riverbank.

165
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,598
He was the bravest ofthe brave...

166
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,188
Look at them.

167
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,831
Stealing, scheming,

168
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,508
betraying and corrupting each other.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,232
There'll never be another dog like my dog.

170
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,030
We're the guardians of a sick flock.

171
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,036
Here, have a drink to celebrate it.

172
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,274
No, thanks.
You drink enough for both of us.

173
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,710
Yes?

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,116
lt's me.

175
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,276
What are you doing?

176
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,390
Watering plants.

177
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,954
Are you angry?

178
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,435
Not angry - bruised.

179
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,430
Forgive me.

180
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,391
l'm sorry l left like l did.

181
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,356
Forgive me?

182
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,233
Sancho, l don't like discussing this
on the phone.

183
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,749
Well, we'll talk later, all right?

184
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,913
l'll be home as soon as l can.

185
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,754
So long, my darling.

186
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,552
My wife's cheating on me.

187
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,229
What?

188
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,238
Clara's sleeping with someone.

189
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,590
Come on, Sancho, don't talk rubbish.

190
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,028
l don't know what to do.

191
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,913
Try drinking less.

192
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,509
Non-drinkers think
not drinking solves it all.

193
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,353
l really don't think alcohol helps you.

194
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,359
lf l don't drink, l'll kill her.

195
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,431
Quit talking shit!

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,796
lt's the only way a woman won't cheat.

197
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,472
Of course, l could kill him.

198
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,198
But l don't know who he is.

199
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,393
Could it be one of them?

200
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,871
To think that any of those creeps
could go screw my wife

201
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,559
while l'm working.

202
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,749
The thought makes me sick.

203
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,917
Beautiful!

204
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,993
No, my father isn't here.
You can come round.

205
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,709
Learn to wait?

206
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,429
l don't give a fuck what Lou Reed says!

207
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,633
lf you aren't here in 1 5 minutes,
l'll call the Pirate.

208
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,115
Yeah, she sells shit,
but at least it's something.

209
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,709
Bring me some chocolate too.
lt'll save me going down.

210
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,557
HOSPlTALS: STATE OF EMERGENCY

211
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,549
Yes, who's that?

212
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,397
Victor.

213
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,316
Victor who?

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,592
The guy from last Saturday.

215
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,310
What guy?

216
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,560
The one you screwed
in the toilets, remember?

217
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,274
l was very high.

218
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,516
We arranged to meet tonight.

219
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,433
l'm about to go out.

220
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,316
Where?

221
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,277
With a friend. Call another day.

222
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,354
A friend?
But you arranged to meet me!

223
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,709
l told you, l forgot!

224
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,472
But l've brought you a pizza.
You said you liked them.

225
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,315
This guy's dumb!

226
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,475
lt's still warm.

227
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,198
Then you eat it!

228
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,550
l've changed my mind.
Don't call me again.

229
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,879
REHEARSAL OF A CRlME

230
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,872
Next stop's Eduardo Dato.

231
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,230
We've done a full circuit of Madrid.

232
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,793
l know.

233
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,353
Aren't you getting out?

234
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,436
No, l'm going on.

235
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,516
Where to?

236
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,073
l don't know. Nowhere.

237
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,590
Nowhere? This isn't a hotel.
You must be going somewhere.

238
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,789
l'm not. So what?

239
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,752
Going to stay here all night?

240
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,710
l'll get out.

241
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,591
When?

242
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,829
Later.

243
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,395
lt'd better be soon. And watch it.

244
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,469
Fucker!

245
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,117
So she had to go out. Liar!

246
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,799
How long ago did he leave?

247
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,759
Tell me the truth,
or l'll go somewhere else.

248
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,435
There he is!

249
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,158
About fucking time! Come up!

250
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,072
Wait in the sitting room.

251
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,038
But don't touch anything.

252
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,473
What are you doing here?

253
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,751
- You let me in.
- Me?

254
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,793
l thought you were somebody else.

255
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,870
Well, it's me.

256
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,357
And we made a date a week ago.

257
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,240
Who do you think you are, anyway?

258
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,437
You were expecting a dealer, right?

259
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,477
What's it to you, arsehole? Get out!

260
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,590
Watch it, eh?

261
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,679
l wasn't rude to you.

262
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,557
l'll go when l get an explanation.

263
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,151
Fuck, don't take it that way.

264
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,070
l just wanted to talk for a while.

265
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,878
l met you a week ago.

266
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,710
We had a really great fuck.

267
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,513
lt was my first time.

268
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,077
You know what that is?

269
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,675
And it's the first time
l've stolen in a pizzeria.

270
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,352
l did it to be with you.

271
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,679
Get out.

272
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,799
Can't you see l'm pointing a gun at you?

273
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,515
Get out of here!

274
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,758
Just because you came between
my legs the other night,

275
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,031
you think you can sneak in here
demanding explanations?

276
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,918
What is this, you shit?

277
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,309
Don't insult me!

278
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,671
A really great fuck?
You wanker! You didn't even stick it in!

279
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,472
You've got a lot to learn!

280
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,109
Shut up!

281
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,188
At that moment, l was sure that
it was l who killed the woman.

282
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,399
And l assure you that this morbid
thought gave me a certain pleasure.

283
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,519
A woman has reported hearing
what may be a shot in her building.

284
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,551
No.18, Eduardo Dato Street.

285
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,035
The caller lives on the second floor.

286
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,029
That's near here.

287
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,158
- Night K to H 50.
- Go ahead, Night K.

288
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,677
We heard your message.
We're on Eduardo Dato Bridge.

289
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,359
We'll check it out.

290
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,399
Very well. The caller didn't seem too sure.

291
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,194
When you've finished, call in your report.

292
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,958
We'll do that.

293
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,151
Still here?

294
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,789
l wasn't going to leave you
here unconscious.

295
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,274
Who do you take me for?

296
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,755
lt really hurts!

297
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,072
You cut my head.

298
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,915
Get out, or l'll call the police.

299
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,877
Oh, God, l need a fix!

300
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,029
Someone called downstairs.
l said you weren't in.

301
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,390
He was pissed off.
He had some chocolate for you.

302
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,917
Are you crazy?

303
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,838
You want me to hit you again?

304
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,875
There's No. 18.

305
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,075
- Who is it?
- Police. We got a call.

306
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,395
Yes, that was me.

307
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,717
My friend here says l'm crazy
but l swear l heard a shot.

308
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,831
- lt was the TV.
- lt wasn't the TV!

309
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,473
Can you let us in, lady?

310
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,194
The lady ofthe house
is away atpresent.

311
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,392
- We're the domestic staff.
- Just open the fucking door!

312
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,911
There's an armed lunatic in there
about to rape your neighbour!

313
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,996
A rapist!

314
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,555
- That's all you think of.
- See, it's Elena!

315
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,469
Give me the radio.

316
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,550
Lay off!

317
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,757
l'll go first. You cover me.

318
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,350
But, Sancho...

319
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,716
We need backup. This is a rathole!

320
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,559
You want to wait till that girl
is raped and killed?

321
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,037
Of course l don't, but this isn't the way.

322
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,838
Scared shitless isn't, either.

323
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,472
l'm scared because l haven't
drunk two bottles of whisky

324
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,153
and no one's screwing my wife!

325
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,920
What was that?
Never mention Clara again!

326
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,518
Cool it, Sancho! Shit!

327
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,878
There's the door.

328
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,710
Now what do we do?
How do we get in?

329
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,559
Give me the radio,
we'll call a squad car.

330
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,399
- We have to get in.
- And how do we do that?

331
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,590
We knock.

332
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,274
Don't take the gun.

333
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,595
lt's my father's.

334
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,597
There's your fucking gun.

335
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,675
Police - open up!

336
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,950
Open up!

337
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,312
Don't move, or l'll shoot!

338
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,670
Take it easy! Let the girl go!

339
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,474
Why are you here?
l haven't done anything!

340
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,951
Tell them it's a mistake.

341
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,509
- lt's your mistake, arsehole.
- Sancho!

342
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,959
l haven't done anything!

343
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,308
That cut on her face?

344
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,710
What cut?

345
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,679
Did l hurt you?
lt must have happened just now!

346
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,990
Let her go, or l'll rip your balls off!

347
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,078
- Sancho, don't provoke him!
- Don't you provoke me!

348
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,589
What's your name?

349
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,116
Victor... Plaza.

350
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,635
l know there's an explanation for all this.

351
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,509
Put down the gun.

352
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,113
Let me have the girl,

353
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,072
then you can explain it all.

354
00:24:59,200 --> 00:24:59,950
Deal?

355
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,914
All right, but tell him
to stop aiming at my balls.

356
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,759
Let her go,
or l'll bounce them off the wall!

357
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,597
Stop!

358
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,119
Give me your gun!

359
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,434
What are you doing?

360
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,991
You've flipped.

361
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,032
You're aiming at a superior!

362
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,356
l'm aiming at a lunatic and a drunk.

363
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,633
Give me your gun.

364
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,956
Victor, here's the deal.
My partner will give me his gun.

365
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,679
Then you put down yours.

366
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,631
Let me have... What's your name?

367
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,549
Elena.

368
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,033
Pleased to meet you.

369
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,389
All right?

370
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,835
Yeah, well...

371
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,912
All right. Sancho,
give me your fucking gun!

372
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,790
Let me go!

373
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,235
Victor, take it easy, all right?

374
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,029
We made a deal. Now it's your turn.

375
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,592
- Yeah, but what'll happen to me?
- Nothing at all.

376
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,034
Put down the gun.

377
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,638
Put it down, please.

378
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,550
Slowly.

379
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,431
That's the way. Miss...

380
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,749
Put down the gun.

381
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,509
Drop the gun!

382
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,954
Sancho, drop the gun!

383
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,358
Sancho, please! Fuck it!

384
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,790
What are you doing? Get out of here!

385
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,035
Go! Get out!

386
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,836
At the Barcelona '92 Paralympics,

387
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:21,589
Spain has won a medal
in wheelchair basketball.

388
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,035
The Spanish team beatArgentina 56-52.

389
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,070
The ball is passed to No. 5, David de Paz,

390
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,196
undoubtedly the best in the game.

391
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,597
De Paz holds out against
the Argentinian defence and shoots.

392
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,476
ln the stands, a special spectator
celebrates the decisive shot.

393
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,353
lt's Elena Benedetti, his wife.

394
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,832
David de Paz,
an ex-policeman paralysed by a bullet

395
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,600
has had an excellent tournament...

396
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,395
What l want

397
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,398
is for you to suffer

398
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,712
the way l suffer.

399
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,832
And l'll learn to pray

400
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,759
to make it happen.

401
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,879
What l want

402
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,118
is for you to feel

403
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,028
as useless

404
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,951
as an empty whisky glass

405
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,676
in someone's hands.

406
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,634
And l want the heart in your breast

407
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,353
to feel as ifit belonged to someone else,

408
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,112
and for it to hurt.

409
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,833
l wish you death

410
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,150
wherever you are.

411
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,952
And l'll learn to pray

412
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,593
to make it happen.

413
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,478
Dear son, l've got cancer.

414
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,309
l won't last until you get out ofjail.

415
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,713
l'm leaving you the house,
if it isn't demolished first,

416
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,117
and my savings,
if this disease doesn't eat them up.

417
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,796
l know l wasn't a good mother.

418
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,430
Whatever l had, l shared with you,

419
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,758
but all l got from the street was misery.

420
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,394
l'm sending the photo
and the news clipping....

421
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,271
Mother,

422
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,630
you'll be glad to know
l'm not on drugs.

423
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,592
Nor have l contractedAlDS.

424
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,230
l study a lot.

425
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,635
l spend the day going to classes
in education, metalwork,

426
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,555
handicrafts, and even theology.

427
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,679
That way l reduce my sentence,
and learn as well.

428
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,270
A Bulgarian inmate
is teaching me Bulgarian.

429
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,672
l'm reading the Bible too.

430
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,632
Right now, l'm into Genesis.

431
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,833
You'll think l'm cracked,

432
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,713
but ifl don't want to go mad
l must keep my mind busy,

433
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,833
and not think.

434
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,749
4 YEARS LATER

435
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,069
Bastard!

436
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,589
Hello, Mother.

437
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,954
l got out two days ago.

438
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,915
l've been cleaning the house since then.

439
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,235
lt was a mess!

440
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,478
l went to the bank today.

441
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,759
For my inheritance.

442
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,399
1 50,000 pesetas.

443
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,999
On my way here,

444
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,675
l was trying to work out

445
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,437
how many tricks you had to turn

446
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,957
to save 1 50,000 pesetas.

447
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,874
At the very least,

448
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,595
1 ,000 tricks.

449
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,037
l get the same amount
without ever having fucked.

450
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,470
lt isn't fair.

451
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,431
However you look at it, it isn't fair!

452
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,151
- l'm sorry, Elena.
- Thank you.

453
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,560
Senora, l'm a friend of David.

454
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,232
Elena, mi dispiace molto.
Ti sono molto vicino.

455
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,635
Mi dispiace molto.

456
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,393
Ti sono molto vicino.

457
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,356
Senora...

458
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,990
- l just want to say l'm sorry.
- Yes...

459
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,748
Chi è?

460
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,910
l'm Ana.

461
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,151
l work with Elena at El Fontanar.

462
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,757
Senora, my deepest sympathy.

463
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,275
- You need more?
- No, that's enough.

464
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,959
- Chief...
- What is it?

465
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,799
May l take some flowers
for my mother's grave?

466
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:19,317
Take all you want.
l don't think Mr Benedetti will mind.

467
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,999
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

468
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,557
We're just about finished.

469
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,830
- You need any more?
- Just a bit.

470
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,316
''El Fontanar Children's Shelter.''

471
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:39,109
''Be brave, Elena. We love you
and need you. From all of us.''

472
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,709
ls this the funeral for Mr Benedetti?

473
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,713
This is the grave,
but the family left ages ago.

474
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,438
l've been wandering around here
like a zombie.

475
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,709
lt was really dull.
And they all went off in a terrible hurry.

476
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,398
- l was disappointed.
- Are you a friend of the family?

477
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,639
Of Elena, really.
All l know about her father

478
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,638
is that he was an ltalian diplomat,
and he had a gun.

479
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,870
And you?

480
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,877
Actually, l know David best.

481
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,999
You think they're happy?

482
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,790
The dead?

483
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,670
Perhaps.

484
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,514
l wonder that too.

485
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,676
No, l meant David and Elena.

486
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,311
l don't know! Ask them!

487
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,350
This way.

488
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,949
Do you know her?

489
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,234
- Or rather, did you know her?
- Not very well.

490
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,915
She was my mother.

491
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,550
Thank you.

492
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,709
l left my car at one of the cemetery gates.

493
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,070
lf you help me find it, l'll give you a lift.

494
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,269
lt's a deal.

495
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,717
Honestly, l've got absolutely
no sense of direction.

496
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,197
l'd get lost in my own back yard.

497
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,515
Can you remember the model and colour?

498
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,551
Come on, l'm not that daft!

499
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,116
My God, this looks like Sarajevo!

500
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,758
- lt's going to be expropriated.
- When?

501
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,520
l don't know.
They're going to build a big avenue.

502
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,512
''The Prince of Asturias.''

503
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,388
Can l offer you a drink?

504
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,797
To be honest,
a drink would help warm me up.

505
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,351
The furniture's coming...

506
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,518
- Maybe we should leave it...
- But l can buy you a drink.

507
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,712
- Look, 1 50,000 pesetas.
- No, another day...

508
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:52,398
Listen, l didn't steal it.
This is an inheritance.

509
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,079
- An inheritance, get it?
- What's the matter?

510
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,277
My name's Clara. And don't get angry.
We'll meet another day.

511
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,038
All right, l'm sorry.

512
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,549
My name's Victor.

513
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,912
Bye, Victor. See you again.

514
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,793
Ti sono molto vicino.

515
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,395
What did you say?

516
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,796
That feels good.

517
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,196
Even better.

518
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,275
Up you go.

519
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,555
l saw Victor Plaza at the funeral.

520
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,350
Victor?

521
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,715
Are you sure?

522
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,835
Yes.

523
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,473
l didn't see him.

524
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,558
You had your back to him.

525
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,834
You were going to the car with Sancho.

526
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,238
Fucking son of a bitch!

527
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,109
Did he say anything?

528
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,193
He sympathised with me.

529
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,594
He's a psychopath.

530
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,598
How did he know about the funeral?

531
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,359
l don't know.

532
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,073
Maybe he followed you.

533
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,672
We have to tell the police.

534
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,790
No, David, don't do anything.

535
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,952
l'm not going to let that madman
follow you around.

536
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,673
We can't report him for expressing
his sympathy to me in public.

537
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,592
People think charity is giving away
the worst things you have.

538
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,549
And it isn't that.

539
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,399
Sure, we get lots of worn-out T-shirts,

540
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,272
but what about anoraks?

541
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,955
We'll have to hit Elena for money again.

542
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,076
You know this is illegal entry?

543
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,753
l don't give a fuck.

544
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,590
Why were you in the cemetery
the other day, spying on my wife?

545
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,153
l wasn't spying on anyone.

546
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,796
My mother died while l was inside.

547
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,395
l just happened to be near
your fucking funeral.

548
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,154
You always happen to be
where you shouldn't.

549
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,474
l'm not as lucky as you.

550
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,349
You always win,
even in the worst moments.

551
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,638
lf you go near my wife again,

552
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,113
l'll crack your skull.

553
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,710
How?

554
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,273
What a goal!

555
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,918
What a fucking goal!

556
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,559
Look, look, look!

557
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,671
Did you see that dribble?

558
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,876
Caminero's brilliant!

559
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,314
You're fucking great!

560
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,270
Well, Victor.

561
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,874
l've warned you.

562
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,390
Help me, l've brought you something.

563
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,670
Great!

564
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,715
We put it like this.
See how good it looks?

565
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,558
- Now it's a sofa.
- Great.

566
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,079
And it opens into a bed.

567
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,470
Thanks a lot.

568
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,716
- Here, read this.
- A Bible.

569
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,189
Yes, it's my Bible.

570
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,117
- What's this?
- Read it.

571
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:42,869
Go on, read it.

572
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,596
''Tonsillectomy in childhood.''

573
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,955
- ''No toxic addictions.''
- Not one.

574
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,717
- ''Haemoglobin. Haemato...'' What?
- Haematocrits.

575
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:53,550
''lron.''

576
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,871
''Anti-HlV, negative.''

577
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,998
So, l'm really healthy.

578
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,999
Yes, you are.

579
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,678
l didn't tell you before...

580
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,597
l've just got out of jail.

581
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,950
Well...

582
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,312
- Hot, isn't it?
- Nice...

583
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,390
What is that?

584
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,473
Bulgarian. lt means...

585
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,557
lf you want, we can open the futon.

586
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,069
Stop looking.

587
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,358
l've never seen anything like it.

588
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,309
Me neither.

589
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,635
Come here.

590
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,190
Here l go.

591
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,670
How was it?

592
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,957
- l didn't even notice.
- l don't have much experience.

593
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,000
- Why don't you teach me?
- You can't teach that.

594
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,799
You can teach anything.
And l learn fast.

595
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,149
Really fast.

596
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,877
l want to become
the best lover in the world!

597
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,479
Tell me the things you like to do,

598
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,074
what you think about
when you masturbate.

599
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,389
l've got time to learn.

600
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:38,037
Look, Victor,
you treated me like a hen's arse.

601
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,073
Christ, what a put-down!

602
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,588
First of all,
don't dive at my pussy so fast.

603
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,074
l mustn't dive at it.

604
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,709
Not to eat it,

605
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,714
or stick it in.

606
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,312
You have to prepare it first.

607
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:57,636
And don't worry,
it'll tell you when it's ready.

608
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,193
How will it tell me?

609
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:02,752
- lt'll tell you. You'll notice.
- l hope so.

610
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,318
That's the first lesson.
Making love involves two people.

611
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,112
Great! And the second?

612
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,476
- Hi, Clemen, how are things?
- A mess.

613
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,877
l had to send Josep home
before he gave us all the flu.

614
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,913
- How are the kids?
- Fine. A volunteer turned up.

615
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,953
- Does he have references?
- He knows a lot about boilers.

616
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,917
- Has he fixed ours?
- He has.

617
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,868
- Great! But who is he?
- Well, he studied education.

618
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,356
He's promised to stay the whole year.
l took a real shine to him.

619
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,595
l can see that!

620
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,991
When he saw that l was so busy,
he offered to help with the kids.

621
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:19,795
And they're having a ball.
They're just crazy about him!

622
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,229
Mr Wolf! Come over here!

623
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,719
Victor, this is Elena.

624
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:48,869
She's the big boss.

625
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,955
Miguel! You're obsessed with legs.

626
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:52,717
Let go!

627
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,478
Pleased to meet you.

628
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,234
- What are you doing, Victor?
- Me? l'm helping.

629
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,590
By following me like a psychopath?

630
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,028
l'm not following you.

631
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,595
Since you got out, l see you everywhere.

632
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,035
l'm sorry, but we live in the same city.

633
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,312
- l don't think you can stay.
- Why not?

634
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,749
Clemen said that

635
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,075
my teaching diploma was acceptable.

636
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,919
Your diploma!
When did you study teaching?

637
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,874
ln jail, by correspondence.

638
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,355
Did you tell Clemen that you were in jail?

639
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:27,470
What's up?

640
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:30,155
l can't stay because l've been in jail?

641
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,349
lt was your fault.

642
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,590
What is this?

643
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,718
An NGO or a ministry?

644
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,196
This is a shelter for 12 children
who have suffered enough.

645
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,517
l don't want our problems to affect them.

646
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,072
''You will be damned in the town,

647
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:49,869
and in the country.''

648
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,430
''Damned will be the fruit of your body,
the produce of your soil.''

649
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:57,116
''You will be damned coming in

650
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,190
and going out.''

651
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:01,875
Deuteronomy.

652
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:03,795
Chapter 28.

653
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:08,358
Moses was thinking of me
when he wrote it.

654
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,549
Lesson number 1 1 . What's it to be today?

655
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,713
Whatever you want.

656
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,116
No, no, no, not whatever l want.

657
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,952
Lesson number 1 1 .

658
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,233
The greatest pleasure for a woman
in love is pleasing her man.

659
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,916
Clara, don't fall in love with me.

660
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,870
You should have warned me before.

661
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:09,551
WELCOME

662
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,438
What are you doing here?

663
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:17,070
l live here.

664
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:20,078
l married you long before
you got Alzheimer's.

665
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:21,829
Where were you?

666
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,117
l was at a class all morning.

667
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,028
Dance class?

668
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:29,194
Yeah, dance class.
What are you cooking?

669
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,999
Bull's tail in brandy.

670
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,591
Are we celebrating something?

671
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,311
Our 12th anniversary.
l took the afternoon off.

672
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,230
God, l'd completely forgotten!

673
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,469
l'm sorry.

674
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,230
l can see that.

675
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,237
Go inside, l'll see to this.

676
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:50,158
Will you fix me a drink?

677
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,750
You lie down like a man to watch TV.

678
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,994
l never knew that only men
lay on the sofa.

679
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,235
So now you know.

680
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:11,589
l'm tired.

681
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,629
Well, it's no wonder
after all that dancing.

682
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,278
You gave it up seven years ago.
Why start again now?

683
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,151
Maybe l'll go back to it.

684
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,353
l need to be busy.

685
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,873
Then take care of us.

686
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,597
Sancho, why don't we separate?

687
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,353
Why don't we separate?

688
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,520
As long as l love you,
you're not leaving me!

689
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,475
One day l'll stop being afraid of you.

690
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,394
And l feel that day isn't too far off.

691
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,790
l have to get back to the kitchen.

692
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,837
And never hit me again!

693
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,439
lt hurts me more than you.

694
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:01,193
All the more reason!

695
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,749
You stay here.

696
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,874
l'll set the table.

697
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,590
Forgive me.

698
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,916
Even though you may not believe it,

699
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,355
as God is my witness,

700
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,235
this will be our last meeting.

701
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:53,233
You will understand

702
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,958
that even ifyou pretend

703
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,552
to be in terrible pain,

704
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,273
you're not going to die.

705
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,473
But abandon now

706
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,990
that illusion.

707
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,437
To no one in the world

708
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,949
shall l give my heart.

709
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,357
Return my love so l may kill it.

710
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,679
Return the tenderness l showed.

711
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:43,677
You don't deserve to keep it.

712
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:48,068
You mean nothing to me now.

713
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:56,677
Give me back my mother's rosary.

714
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,995
Everything else you may keep.

715
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,630
Your things l'll send you one evening.

716
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:12,355
For you are not to see me any more.

717
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:17,035
l'd do anything for the kids,
but you owe me two months.

718
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:19,310
The council is slow in paying us.

719
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,239
That ltalian woman's loaded.
She can fork out.

720
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,509
Really, Rosa.

721
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,235
Clemen, we're going to the dentist.

722
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,908
lf he mentions the bill, get him to call me.

723
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:30,553
400,000 pesetas...

724
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,079
- Hello.
- David!

725
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,918
- ls my wife here?
- Shall l get her?

726
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,633
No, it's all right, thanks.

727
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:38,231
Come on, just give me two days.

728
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,670
Well, go and buy them this afternoon.

729
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:05,869
Thanks, Elena.

730
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:06,956
Hello, David.

731
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,955
You look awful. Are you all right?

732
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,832
l saw Victor come in here.

733
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,673
He works as a volunteer.

734
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,750
What?

735
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,398
Please, don't make a scene.

736
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,718
How could you accept him?

737
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:27,593
l didn't. l came in one day
and he was here.

738
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:29,279
l don't understand.

739
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,512
This isn't the army.

740
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,712
l can't countermand the others
without giving a reason.

741
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,598
And Victor's a good worker.

742
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,915
Fuck that!

743
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,229
What can l do?

744
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,993
- Victor, can't you see l'm busy?
- Excuse me.

745
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,990
- l'd like a word before you go.
- Yes, l'd like that too.

746
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,230
Would you mind leaving us alone?

747
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,634
Yes, l'd mind a lot!

748
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,229
Don't worry, my love.
Nothing will happen.

749
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:07,033
This is the last place
where you should have met.

750
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:13,232
Victor, let's be frank.

751
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,717
That woman who's just gone out
is my wife.

752
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,553
l'm crazy about her.

753
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,833
l'd do anything to defend her,
because she's all l have.

754
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,115
And like all cripples,
l've got a filthy temper.

755
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,993
l'm sure you love your wife
and have a filthy temper.

756
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,272
But it's not my business.

757
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,236
Come on!

758
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:34,078
lt is a bit, l think.

759
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,310
Before l met you, l looked up
at the sun, the stars, the moon.

760
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,831
Since l met you, l have to look down.

761
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,118
l have to look at dog shit
so l don't stain my hands,

762
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,795
at kerbs so l don't crack my skull!

763
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:48,632
You condemned me to look down!

764
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,239
l didn't condemn you to anything!

765
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,236
- l don't give a shit if you fired by accident!
- lt wasn't an accident!

766
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,996
- You mean you did it on purpose?
- lt wasn't me who shot you!

767
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,710
lt was Sancho! Clara told me.

768
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,598
How could he have shot me?
You had the gun.

769
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:12,950
Get off!

770
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:15,276
Victor, get off! Let me go, please!

771
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:16,469
Victor, please!

772
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:20,036
l didn't want to press the trigger!
l didn't want to shoot you!

773
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,830
- Take the gun!
- What are you doing?

774
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,594
Put your finger on the trigger,
but don't press it.

775
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,234
l pressed the trigger,

776
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,632
but Sancho pressed my finger.

777
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,272
He did it because
you were screwing his wife.

778
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,396
Clara wanted to leave him for you.

779
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:50,989
He knew that.

780
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,314
That's why he shot you.

781
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,956
l spoke to ''Messengers of Peace''.

782
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,268
They have a house for children with AlDS.

783
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,399
l'm seeing them tomorrow.

784
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,994
lf they accept me, l'll leave El Fontanar.

785
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,555
l've already told the others.

786
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:32,795
How can you leave?

787
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,520
This way, Victor will have
no excuse to see me.

788
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:38,312
l thought you'd be pleased.

789
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,318
No, and l don't like you being a martyr.

790
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:44,911
How can the others let you leave?
You set up that house.

791
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,157
l'm not abandoning them.
l'll still help financially.

792
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,276
What about the kids? Your kids.

793
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,191
l don't know how l'll leave them.

794
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,877
But l can't think about myself.

795
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,479
Come here, Elena.

796
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:02,275
Come on, we'll smoke a joint
and relax a bit, all right?

797
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,988
We've both had...

798
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:05,949
..a tough day.

799
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:07,310
Come on.

800
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,151
- You look pretty relaxed to me.
- l've already smoked one.

801
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:17,115
What did you and Victor talk about?

802
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,272
- Didn't he tell you?
- No.

803
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,959
l didn't ask him.

804
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,788
l'm asking you.

805
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:49,197
So what did you talk about?

806
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:51,790
Here.

807
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:57,519
About the shooting.

808
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,837
Victor says it wasn't him.

809
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,555
But he had the gun. l don't understand.

810
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,196
There are things l never told you.

811
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,276
They happened before l met you.

812
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,235
l was very close to Sancho.

813
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,068
And also to Clara.

814
01:03:29,160 --> 01:03:30,639
Specially to Clara.

815
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,751
Let it out. lnsult me if you want.

816
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:45,674
Do whatever you want,
but say something.

817
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:52,355
Say something!

818
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,198
Go to sleep, Aitor.

819
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,876
Be careful, you'll catch cold.

820
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,869
l needed some air.

821
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,356
David told me about the shooting.

822
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,110
And?

823
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:44,989
l can imagine how
you must have hated me,

824
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:46,713
how you still hate me.

825
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:49,319
How could l hate you?

826
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,358
Do l look like l hate you now?

827
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,637
Until recently all l wanted was
to get revenge on you two.

828
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,069
l even had a plan.

829
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:01,038
- A plan of revenge?
- Yes.

830
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,999
A ridiculous plan.

831
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,311
Of all that happened that night,

832
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:08,353
what hurt me most was
that you called me a wanker

833
01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:10,676
and said l couldn't fuck.

834
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,589
l swore l'd make you
eat those words someday.

835
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,639
Worst of all, it was true.

836
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,190
So l decided that when l got out of jail

837
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,675
l'd become the world's best lover.

838
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,114
My plan was to spend
a whole night with you.

839
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,434
During that night,
l'd fuck you non-stop,

840
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,119
until l split you in two.

841
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,036
l'd give you more pleasure
than you'd ever dreamed of.

842
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,674
And, naturally, you would fall for me.

843
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:39,909
But l'd dump you,

844
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:45,350
and l'd never go back to you,
not even if you begged me.

845
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,434
That was my revenge.

846
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:50,195
That was my plan.

847
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:53,635
Goodbye, Victor.

848
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:57,472
Don't go so quickly.

849
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:00,992
l'm leaving in a few days.

850
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,037
l suppose we won't meet again.

851
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,438
ln order to forget Elena,

852
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,751
l got ajob, and started
reading the Bible again,

853
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:17,109
as l did injail.

854
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,150
On the first day,

855
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,877
God created the night
so that lovers couldn't sleep.

856
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:26,029
He created water so that it would
drip constantly from market roofs.

857
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:29,193
And he created fish,
not to fill the seas with them,

858
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,119
but so that l could unload them
before dawn,

859
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,079
and, in that way, not think about Elena

860
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,713
and not go insane.

861
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,270
What a fright! Give me a kiss.

862
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:44,675
Give me a kiss!

863
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,391
Squeeze me, come on.

864
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:51,352
- Where were you these two weeks?
- ln Portugal.

865
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,470
- You smell different.
- lt's fish. What were you doing?

866
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:59,113
- Tourism, and a cure.
- Tourism.

867
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:02,397
Didn't you get my card?

868
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,513
l couldn't tell you before.

869
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,591
Sancho suspects something,

870
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,109
so he's reforming to try to win me back.

871
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,556
We even went to a clinic.

872
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,513
- The bastard's stopped drinking.
- And you?

873
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,389
l'm drinking even more, can't you see?

874
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:19,949
l'm going to shower.

875
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:22,955
Anything wrong?

876
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,518
No, nothing, l'm tired.

877
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:29,077
l'm working at the market now,
as well as at the shelter.

878
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,514
Unloading crates.

879
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:35,396
- Why are you working so hard?
- What do you mean, why?

880
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:37,792
l can't leech off you for ever.

881
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:38,910
Why not?

882
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:41,559
The things you say...

883
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:42,590
Wait.

884
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,318
We must stop meeting.

885
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,553
Don't tell me that.

886
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,357
l don't want anything from you.

887
01:07:57,760 --> 01:07:59,557
Just to see you occasionally.

888
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,871
We both have to sort out our lives,

889
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:03,670
but...

890
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,672
we must do it separately.

891
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,110
But why?

892
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,717
l'm not asking you to love me!

893
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,791
l love you enough for both of us.

894
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,150
Clara, do you notice an odd smell?

895
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,636
Clara, l smell something odd.

896
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,079
Christ, the frying pan!

897
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:49,835
Are you crazy?

898
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:51,468
What's up with you?

899
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,917
Christ! Shit!

900
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,828
Fucking hell!

901
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:26,957
- l thought you weren't coming.
- l'd a problem at home.

902
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,355
They're asleep. lt's all been done.

903
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,873
Great, thanks a lot.

904
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,279
Go and see your girl. And happy birthday!

905
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:35,919
Give her a kiss for me.

906
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,797
l didn't know you were here.

907
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,029
l came to get my things from the office.

908
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,634
Don't go. lf anyone has to go, it's me.

909
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:25,830
Be quiet.

910
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,830
Promise that you won't look for me,

911
01:10:29,640 --> 01:10:31,312
and we won't meet again.

912
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:36,915
Promise me.

913
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:38,875
Yes, l promise.

914
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,795
We are an impossible dream,

915
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:27,476
seeking the night

916
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:33,273
to forget in its shadows

917
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,314
the world and all else.

918
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:42,269
We, in our daydream,

919
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,751
painful and beloved,

920
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:51,790
two leaves that the wind

921
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,959
brought together in autumn.

922
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,356
We are two beings in one

923
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,075
who, loving each other, die

924
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:20,790
to keep the secret

925
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:25,109
of their love.

926
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:32,231
But what will life matter

927
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:37,713
when we are separated?

928
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:43,119
We are two teardrops

929
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,193
in a song.

930
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,435
But what will life matter...

931
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,394
Dawn's breaking.

932
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:04,514
We are two teardrops

933
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:07,912
in a song.

934
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:14,914
Nothing more

935
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,239
are we,

936
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:25,233
nothing more.

937
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,679
- David...
- Yes, did l wake you?

938
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,916
l didn't expect you so soon.

939
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,268
l came back on my own
from Seville, in a taxi.

940
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:51,552
l didn't wait for the team.

941
01:15:52,200 --> 01:15:54,270
Go to sleep, you must be exhausted.

942
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,072
No, l'm not tired.

943
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,150
What's up? Not in the mood?

944
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,429
lt isn't that.

945
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:08,595
lt hurts.

946
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,670
lt hurts?

947
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,069
How come?

948
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,551
l was fucking all night.

949
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,635
What are you doing?

950
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:48,950
l'm leaving.

951
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:50,590
To go where?

952
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,515
Far away.

953
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:55,198
Clara, don't start.

954
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:58,836
Give me an Alka-Seltzer.
My head's exploding.

955
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:06,639
Let me past.

956
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,518
Why not forget last night?

957
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:39,994
Take it easy, Clara.

958
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,037
Give me the keys and let me go.

959
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,912
We deserve another chance.

960
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:46,118
We've had too many.

961
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,194
Get out of the way.

962
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:50,435
l can change.

963
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:53,793
l proved it last week, didn't l?

964
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,230
- Fuck, forgive me!
- l forgive you.

965
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:33,669
Who was it?

966
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,076
Knowing that won't help you.

967
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:39,912
You doing it hasn't helped me.

968
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,709
lt was Victor.

969
01:18:45,160 --> 01:18:46,718
Bastard! l knew it!

970
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:49,999
lt was my fault.

971
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:51,439
lt won't happen again.

972
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,518
Why should l believe you?

973
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,474
l never lie, David.

974
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:56,950
That's true.

975
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:59,870
Yes, you're offensively honest.

976
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:03,348
What will you do now?

977
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:05,915
Stay with you, if you don't throw me out.

978
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:07,633
Didn't you enjoy it?

979
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:08,995
l didn't say that.

980
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:11,390
Then why the fuck stay with me?

981
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,111
You need me more than he does.

982
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,959
Right, l'll keep exploiting
your guilt complex.

983
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:41,750
David!

984
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:46,559
David, open the door!

985
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:49,309
What are you doing?

986
01:19:51,560 --> 01:19:52,595
So long.

987
01:19:52,840 --> 01:19:54,159
Please, open the door!

988
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,670
- Where are you going?
- Training.

989
01:20:01,880 --> 01:20:02,869
Are you sure?

990
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,599
Of course l'm sure.

991
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,440
Who are you worried about?
Me or him?

992
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,915
The three of us.

993
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,194
Who did he speak to?

994
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:52,150
Yes?

995
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,234
Clara, is that you?

996
01:20:59,080 --> 01:21:00,354
Clara, answer me.

997
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,480
Wherever you hide, l swear l'll find you.

998
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,436
This time you've had a serious row.

999
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:23,595
No, not at all.

1000
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,638
We were doing really well.

1001
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:27,519
l'd stopped drinking.

1002
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,238
But she flipped,

1003
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,076
and belted me with her beauty case.

1004
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,793
ls that a bullet wound?

1005
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:39,191
Yes, but she didn't mean
to hit me. lt's just a scratch.

1006
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:42,870
lf you'd had your back to her,
you could've ended up like me.

1007
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,355
l wouldn't mind ending up
in a wheelchair

1008
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,272
if l could get Clara back.

1009
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,158
You stupid bastard.

1010
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:51,554
- What?
- Nothing.

1011
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,991
- You got any coke?
- Coke?

1012
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,519
No, why do you want it?

1013
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:04,594
l don't want to cry.

1014
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:09,156
Cocaine dries up your tears.
lt cools you down.

1015
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:11,629
Let me help you.

1016
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,918
Come on, let me help you.

1017
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,310
Fuck!

1018
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:25,910
Give me that.

1019
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,308
Thanks, David.

1020
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:33,278
What did you want to tell me?

1021
01:22:34,040 --> 01:22:35,393
Clara sent you, right?

1022
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,073
- No.
- Really?

1023
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:39,037
Clara hasn't seen me in ages.

1024
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:41,513
But l've seen her.

1025
01:22:43,400 --> 01:22:44,310
Look.

1026
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:01,279
You love Crispies.
Why won't you eat them?

1027
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:04,917
And what's up with you?
You're big enough to feed yourself.

1028
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,551
Oh, he didn't like that at all!

1029
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,430
Yes?

1030
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:12,797
- Hello, Clemen, this is Elena.
- Hi, Elena. What's up?

1031
01:23:12,920 --> 01:23:13,955
ls Victor there?

1032
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,070
No, he isn't.

1033
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,350
Where is he?

1034
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:18,310
Listen, Elena.

1035
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,993
You said you didn't want to see him.

1036
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,748
lt's important.

1037
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:26,634
You said that ifhe asked
for your address

1038
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,637
we weren't to give it, and now...

1039
01:23:29,640 --> 01:23:31,631
Now l'm asking for his. What is it?

1040
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,796
Really, l can't believe this.

1041
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,350
Don't think that because you fund us

1042
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:38,670
you have the right to boss us around.

1043
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,273
Don't torture me.
l've tortured myself enough.

1044
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:43,669
Don't be like that.

1045
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,717
Victor lives in La Ventilla,
in one of the prefabs.

1046
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:01,990
Not only did she fix up his house,

1047
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:05,832
he's been screwing her
since he got out of jail!

1048
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,310
Where does he live?

1049
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:51,869
My boy!

1050
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:14,433
Dear Victor,

1051
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:18,950
l'd like you to keep this note
among the pages ofyour Bible,

1052
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,355
along with the things you most love.

1053
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:24,873
When you read this l will be dead,
or running away.

1054
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:28,431
You mustn't feel responsible, orpity me.

1055
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,070
When l came to your door,
l knew l'd end up like this neighbourhood,

1056
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:33,793
expropriated and destroyed.

1057
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:37,153
But l have no regrets.
Nor do l blame you, my love.

1058
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,877
Before l met you,
l was already condemned to disappear.

1059
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,670
l'm leaving your key and some money.

1060
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,589
l couldn't get any more because
l'm running away from Sancho.

1061
01:25:49,480 --> 01:25:50,879
Get out ofMadrid.

1062
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:54,951
l know you have more reason
than ever to stay now,

1063
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:57,674
but Elena will understand too.

1064
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,838
Keep away from Sancho.

1065
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:05,594
lt would be pointless to confront him.

1066
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:09,352
People like you and me
weren't born to kill.

1067
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,879
We may hurt others.

1068
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:15,398
l would even say we have
a special gift for that,

1069
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:17,679
but we don't kill them.

1070
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,389
There he is.

1071
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:25,635
l'm sure it's him.

1072
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:29,354
l know the way he hammers on doors.

1073
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:32,639
Goodbye, Victor.

1074
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,555
Where's Victor?

1075
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,638
He's gone. He doesn't live here any more.

1076
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,388
Where does he live?

1077
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:55,470
l don't know.

1078
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:01,478
What are we going to do now?

1079
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,438
Shoot each other?

1080
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,469
Tell me another way to settle it.

1081
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,868
That depends on you.

1082
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,472
This sums up my life.

1083
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,108
Dragging myself along to be near you.

1084
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,874
l should have ripped
your balls off that night.

1085
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:03,349
Shoot!

1086
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,434
What's keeping you?

1087
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,955
Will l have to shoot for you again?

1088
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,157
You stole six years of my life.

1089
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,237
You stole much more from me.

1090
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:21,071
Clara didn't belong to you.

1091
01:28:22,040 --> 01:28:24,076
Your life didn't belong to you.

1092
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,829
No one ever owns his youth,

1093
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:38,556
or the women he loves.

1094
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:40,515
lt can't be!

1095
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:43,190
David!

1096
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,757
What are you doing here?

1097
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:31,912
Elena, l'm in Miami.

1098
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:37,199
l'm spending the holiday here
with some friends.

1099
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:40,274
lt's my first Christmas in the sun,

1100
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,758
and the first in six years without you.

1101
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:48,990
Although it hurts me to admit it,

1102
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,670
l understand you more than ever.

1103
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:55,151
l understand your lack ofjoy,

1104
01:29:56,440 --> 01:29:58,396
why l so rarely saw you laugh.

1105
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,797
Don't feel guilty about anything,
because l'm to blame

1106
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:05,997
for what happened in Eduardo Dato,

1107
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,595
and for the massacre in La Ventilla.

1108
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:14,358
Look on this declaration ofguilt

1109
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,358
as a declaration oflove,

1110
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,592
and as my Christmas gift.

1111
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:31,438
- Victor!
- Yes?

1112
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:33,030
ls it time?

1113
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:34,550
Come on!

1114
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:42,478
Goodbye!

1115
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:50,875
- Josep!
- What?

1116
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:52,593
- Hurry.
- Which way do l go?

1117
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,677
- The fastest way!
- Where's that?

1118
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:57,838
- Through the centre.
- No, we'll never make it.

1119
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,956
Everyone's watching the big
soccer game. We'll make it.

1120
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:03,269
Come on, breathe.

1121
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:04,515
Hang on, my love.

1122
01:31:04,720 --> 01:31:06,790
And you, don't be so impatient.

1123
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:08,792
Come on, do the seal.

1124
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:10,909
Come on, Josep, the seal!

1125
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:20,639
The contractions!

1126
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,989
Don't be so impatient. Hang on.

1127
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,479
l'll try to convince him.

1128
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,632
l know exactly how you feel.

1129
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,469
26 years ago, l was in the same
situation, about to be born.

1130
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:36,236
But you're much luckier than l was.

1131
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,353
lt's so different now.

1132
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:40,431
Look at the sidewalk, full of people.

1133
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:42,995
When l was born,
there wasn't a soul on the street.

1134
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,430
People were shut up at home,
scared shitless.

1135
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:46,709
Fortunately for you, son,

1136
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,511
in Spain we stopped being scared
a long time ago.
