1
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,234
<i>Cygnus : My name is cygnus.</i>

2
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,836
<i> I am my people's hunter.</i>

3
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,306
<i> And it has grown scarce</i>
<i> for some time.</i>

4
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,143
<i> We are the children of man.</i>

5
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,480
<i> Out here, we are</i>
<i> not the only ones.</i>

6
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,751
<i> Many bands now travel</i>
<i> the land again.</i>

7
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:35,454
<i> We are called last arc.</i>

8
00:02:35,456 --> 00:02:38,657
<i> The ones with stories</i>
<i> on our skin.</i>

9
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,593
<i> I wondered what</i>
<i> became of the world</i>

10
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,196
<i>before the one I was born into.</i>

11
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,134
<i> I only knew a world where</i>
<i> the few moved together.</i>

12
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:52,838
<i> I have farther to go to</i>
<i> find the beasts I hunt.</i>

13
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,151
Hey!

14
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,587
Hey!

15
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,935
Let me go. Let me go! Please.

16
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,004
Why are you here?

17
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,939
I know you.

18
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:36,908
Now you see it too, right?

19
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,378
The darker days.

20
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,380
Yes.

21
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:43,649
Me too, I see 'em too.

22
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,585
But she needs you.

23
00:04:46,587 --> 00:04:48,453
Hunter of blood...

24
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,789
And hope.

25
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,293
Hope is not what I hunt for.

26
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,130
Does it look like
i have any hope?

27
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,498
<i> Hey!</i>

28
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,468
I'm just like you!
I see it too!

29
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,641
I know your story too.

30
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,010
You're the little boy.

31
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:17,316
The little boy that
killed the snakes.

32
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,357
I'm done. The end!

33
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,530
No!

34
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,801
<i> Cygnus : I live</i>
<i> away from last arc</i>

35
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:37,736
<i>to hear what the wind is saying.</i>

36
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:40,539
<i> Even if it makes</i>
<i> me their outsider.</i>

37
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,675
<i> It's telling me that</i>
<i> this can't go on.</i>

38
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:47,012
<i> Sometimes I ask myself</i>
<i> why I stay.</i>

39
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,682
<i> But then I remember they</i>
<i> found me and brought me in.</i>

40
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:53,719
<i> They gave me a place</i>
<i> to call home.</i>

41
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:56,755
<i> For this I have my life.</i>

42
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,566
The sun has crossed
the river track

43
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,802
and brings the hunter back.

44
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,572
They know the way.

45
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,109
They found us, cygnus

46
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,412
we're against the days.

47
00:06:57,884 --> 00:07:00,419
It doesn't help it's
written all over them.

48
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,754
They're afraid.

49
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,126
It's the future that
must be protected.

50
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,431
They don't go out there
like you do.

51
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,600
They can't.

52
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,837
They're watching.

53
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,609
Is everyone here?

54
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,888
They're near.

55
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,123
How many?

56
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,958
Three.

57
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,182
You're the hunter.

58
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:07,319
You're the one that
killed the snakes.

59
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,890
What's it like?

60
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,726
<i> Elden: Elias!</i>

61
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,195
<i> Elias.</i>

62
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:21,032
Elias!

63
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,108
<i> Listen to me, okay?</i>

64
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,776
That hunter

65
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:34,279
has a mind where killing
is a natural act.

66
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:36,548
That hunter is not
the same as you.

67
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,251
<i>Elias: It's not you or him, dad.</i>

68
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,087
Mom wanted us to live.

69
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,044
I know you.

70
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,914
Who's there?

71
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:27,852
<i> Cygnus: Nova, it's me.</i>
<i> I'm coming in.</i>

72
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,423
You precede yourself.

73
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,562
It's not me you should
be concerned about.

74
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:39,964
You have a new orphan,

75
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,133
and he's lucky to be alive.

76
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:44,302
Elden was a good father

77
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:46,604
but he didn't know how to
handle himself out there.

78
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,244
Before we know the way out

79
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,549
we must know ourselves first.

80
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,920
The heretics should not
be this close.

81
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:05,390
Is that not a sign?

82
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,060
Cygnus

83
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,230
I need to send you.

84
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,568
Send me where?

85
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,744
Somewhere in the darkness.

86
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,080
Where there is light.

87
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,584
<i> Nova: That has an answer.</i>

88
00:12:34,553 --> 00:12:36,488
What do you see?

89
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:39,257
<i> I see us all trying to...</i>

90
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,263
It's not easy.

91
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,099
Survival never is.

92
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,668
But it's not a choice
that we get to make.

93
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:57,375
I believe in the stories.

94
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,544
I've heard the stories.

95
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,346
I'll believe it
when I see scars.

96
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,849
Then look at this!

97
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,225
Who died

98
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:16,828
in search with no end?

99
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,264
Our ancestors!

100
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:20,865
Ours!

101
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,036
Don't you forget that.

102
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,741
The hunt is all that
I've ever known.

103
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:32,644
I'm not asking you to kill.

104
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:35,980
I'm asking you to hunt.

105
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,317
To find the answers

106
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,486
that will stop this.

107
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,532
Shappa.

108
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,169
Don't say it.

109
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,004
I know.

110
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:02,507
What do you know?

111
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:05,009
Nova sent you.

112
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:08,179
Did she say why?

113
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,848
She knows why she
wants me here.

114
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,583
Ha!

115
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,953
Nova knows what she wants,

116
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:16,554
and doesn't want.

117
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,691
I need an answer.

118
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,863
You need to be hunting
for food, not answers.

119
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,867
Nova wants me to find something.

120
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:31,903
I'm not a scholar.
Where do I begin?

121
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,007
With a question!

122
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,053
<i> It's in here somewhere.</i>

123
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:50,989
Oh!

124
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,624
Okay, look.

125
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,459
Over here.

126
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,794
Over here.

127
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,731
This is also the answer!

128
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,566
Where would the answer be

129
00:15:01,568 --> 00:15:04,068
if it had be somewhere?

130
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,405
Wherever it isn't.

131
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:13,945
There would be older
breakage here.

132
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,082
And?

133
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,819
It's been hot here
for a very long time.

134
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,291
That's a good place to look.

135
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,092
Why?

136
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:30,461
If you think of population

137
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,431
or what used to be present.

138
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,200
Then it's pretty
simple to look at

139
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,869
what isn't

140
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,938
and what is.

141
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,842
There could be more
like us out there.

142
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:49,347
I need to take a look
at your stories.

143
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,129
Yeah, yeah.

144
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,470
You were there!

145
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:16,507
I remember a burning sky.

146
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,012
And being taken up when a
shadow eclipsed the sun.

147
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,053
Tokens of our past

148
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,489
are our guide

149
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,691
when we have no map.

150
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,863
You could kill snakes
with your two hands

151
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:42,500
before you could even walk.

152
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,004
You have strength.

153
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,539
Don't be afraid to use it.

154
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,846
We don't have a choice now.

155
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,615
This time

156
00:16:57,617 --> 00:16:59,584
had to come.

157
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:32,350
Can you tell me

158
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:34,886
what it's like to be alone?

159
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:39,624
The world listens to you live.

160
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,127
Don't be afraid.

161
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,064
My dad had more to tell me.

162
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,766
I just hope we can find
a way out of here.

163
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:51,836
That's what I am going for.

164
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,237
<i> Here.</i>

165
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,605
<i> Take these.</i>

166
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,241
They're from my dad.

167
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,243
Give it to the ones
who are hiding,

168
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,412
waiting to kill.

169
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,454
I will stand for you
to find your way.

170
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:11,756
I promise.

171
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,703
It will soon be ours.

172
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,808
He said

173
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,211
we can't kill this one.

174
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:02,580
He said he doesn't want him.

175
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,882
He needs him.

176
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:12,556
I see what you are,

177
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,558
hunter.

178
00:23:18,663 --> 00:23:21,465
You should have killed
me. Why didn't you?

179
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,402
I don't regret letting you live.

180
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,672
You're already dead.

181
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,350
Yeah!

182
00:23:39,352 --> 00:23:40,918
Yes!

183
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,019
Harder!

184
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,854
Make him bleed!

185
00:23:43,856 --> 00:23:45,356
Yeah!

186
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:46,257
Oh!

187
00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:47,892
Yes!

188
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,462
<i> Lexi: Zizzik!</i>

189
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:53,597
You know you can't kill him.

190
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,869
This I need to know.

191
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,604
Not for him,

192
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,440
but for our power.

193
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,875
It's been years!

194
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,577
What is one more day?

195
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:09,547
We are tired of waiting, Lexi!

196
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,916
Lupis, stay out of this.

197
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:13,717
Something must break!

198
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:16,220
Either it's him, or it's us.

199
00:24:16,222 --> 00:24:18,289
So stop fighting me.

200
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,392
If I don't fight today,
tomorrow there are no "if's".

201
00:24:21,394 --> 00:24:23,627
Torik needs the answers!

202
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,631
No! No!

203
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,637
Aha! Ha!!

204
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,558
Many will die

205
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,928
to keep a noose around
that killer's collar.

206
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,976
Don't worry.

207
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,778
We'll get there.

208
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,480
It is done.

209
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,649
Bring her up here.

210
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,894
We need the power, torik.

211
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,499
Betrayal opens the door.

212
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,934
Remember that.

213
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:52,302
Man did.

214
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:54,505
That's what moved them.

215
00:27:54,507 --> 00:27:56,273
Her betrayal

216
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:59,510
will open the door to
your heart's desire.

217
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:01,545
Isn't that interesting?

218
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,638
<i> Come on!</i>

219
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,376
Mari: No!

220
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,828
When I was

221
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,263
in the hills once

222
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:56,066
one of them horses

223
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,403
she couldn't move much, you see!

224
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:02,573
It wasn't her fault.

225
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,244
She tripped in a
big, black hole.

226
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,580
But,

227
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:12,750
it wasn't the ones
who moved her

228
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:15,085
it was the ones who grew her,

229
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:16,854
raised her.

230
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,557
And after long

231
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,127
she got weak in the knee

232
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,264
do you know what they did?

233
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,235
Do you know

234
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,103
what they did!?

235
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,938
Ahh!

236
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,079
They watched that most

237
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,114
beautiful creature

238
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,116
die.

239
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:49,953
And do you know why?

240
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,356
Because with

241
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,957
hunters like

242
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,459
that one

243
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,463
they would be next.

244
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,667
Oh.

245
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,637
The deal has changed.

246
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:12,376
Ahhh!!

247
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:26,156
They will never
understand you, cygnus.

248
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,592
Not like I do.

249
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,928
That's the killer, cygnus.

250
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,996
That one.

251
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,303
Take this blade

252
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,405
and end this.

253
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,743
And your precious last arc
will be free forever.

254
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,180
Refuse and...

255
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:56,753
All those beautiful
souls you hunt for

256
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,190
will be...

257
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,260
Well...

258
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,730
So what will it be?

259
00:31:23,481 --> 00:31:25,582
That's it.

260
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,562
There's the answer!

261
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,498
You...

262
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,934
Made a wise choice today.

263
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:52,242
Today

264
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:54,511
you made history.

265
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,079
No!

266
00:31:59,851 --> 00:32:02,386
She will die.

267
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:04,488
Then he will die.

268
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,758
Then all the people he calls

269
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,226
his people

270
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,595
will die.

271
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,096
Hm?

272
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,604
Chain them up!

273
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,626
I see what you fight for.

274
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:45,629
Why didn't he kill you
when he saw I couldn't?

275
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,298
They were promised power
where we're going.

276
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,801
They want us alive.

277
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,984
<i> Zizzik: Black sand.</i>

278
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,321
Is this the place?

279
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,658
Just a little further.

280
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,260
Man left it there.

281
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,695
For us?

282
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,498
For all of us.

283
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,517
Do you know what is in there?

284
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:45,856
Everything their world had,
and their children do not.

285
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,212
This

286
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:13,050
is how it ends!

287
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,625
Will this do?

288
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:48,145
At least we still have time
before they try to get in.

289
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:53,150
Now I can ask

290
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,352
what is your name?

291
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,456
Mari.

292
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,491
A wolf without a pack.

293
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,660
Packs hold me back.

294
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:05,762
But

295
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,498
I have heard of the last arc.

296
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,701
I know them well.

297
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,839
Are you with them?

298
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,580
Are you with them!?

299
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,520
They need me.

300
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,893
And I need them.

301
00:36:42,466 --> 00:36:44,201
You mean that.

302
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,910
My name is cygnus.

303
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:02,219
Like the constellation.

304
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:08,658
You are far from home.

305
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:14,030
Ahh! No!

306
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,352
I know what you're thinking.

307
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:13,456
You first.

308
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,638
This is the same as above.

309
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,841
It's how we got in.

310
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,244
We got in because you pulled us

311
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,446
to what could have
been our deaths.

312
00:38:36,448 --> 00:38:38,848
Did we have another choice?

313
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:45,322
Let's keep moving.

314
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,669
Mari?

315
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,506
Mari?

316
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:43,039
<i> The bride: That's terrible!</i>

317
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,075
<i> You have been haunting me</i>
<i> with that since last night.</i>

318
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,877
<i> Crypt architect: It's</i>
<i> based on a philosophy.</i>

319
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:49,279
<i> The walls of this place</i>

320
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,114
<i> will not protect all we knew.</i>

321
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,283
<i> Only the most important thing.</i>

322
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,752
<i> The bride: Why do you</i>
<i> follow me with that thing?</i>

323
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:58,688
<i> I can't see both your eyes,</i>
<i> I want to see your eyes.</i>

324
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,492
<i> I want to see your eyes</i>
<i> like I saw them last night.</i>

325
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,128
<i> James.</i>

326
00:41:06,063 --> 00:41:08,064
<i> Put it down.</i>

327
00:41:08,066 --> 00:41:11,100
<i> Put it down quickly.</i>

328
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,403
<i> C'mon, put it down!</i>

329
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:18,074
<i> You're crazy and you're mad.</i>

330
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,343
<i> And god, I love you.</i>

331
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,919
<i> Grandmother: It's not</i>
<i> something we can find.</i>

332
00:41:29,921 --> 00:41:31,454
<i> Only something</i>

333
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:34,123
<i> we can know in ourselves.</i>

334
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,159
<i> Don't worry my child,</i>

335
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,261
<i> that's what I am here for.</i>

336
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:40,430
<i> Little girl: I know</i>
<i> she loves me.</i>

337
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,965
<i> I know she's gone</i>

338
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,666
<i> but she won't be long.</i>

339
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,668
<i> She's my hero</i>

340
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,203
<i> is what I told my class.</i>

341
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,641
<i> She told me lots of people are</i>
<i> going to sleep these days</i>

342
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:53,776
<i> because of the ocean.</i>

343
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:55,445
<i> Crypt architect: A crypt.</i>

344
00:41:55,447 --> 00:41:57,547
<i> Made when the season of man</i>
<i> came to an end.</i>

345
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,852
<i> Grandmother: No one lives</i>
<i> forever, my child.</i>

346
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,322
<i>That's why life is so marvelous.</i>

347
00:42:06,324 --> 00:42:09,626
<i>And every day we live is a gift.</i>

348
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,461
<i> Little girl: I love it</i>
<i> when she tells me stories</i>

349
00:42:11,463 --> 00:42:14,464
<i> about the whole big</i>
<i> world that she sees.</i>

350
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:17,033
<i> Grandmother: That little</i>
<i> light deep in your heart,</i>

351
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:19,035
<i> is your soul.</i>

352
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:23,106
<i> Use it to make the</i>
<i> world a better place.</i>

353
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,677
<i> The bride: You're</i>
<i> crazy and you're mad.</i>

354
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,813
<i> And god, I love you.</i>
<i> And god, I love you.</i>

355
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:32,515
<i> I love you so much.</i>

356
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,617
<i> Crypt architect: All things</i>
<i> must come to a close.</i>

357
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,654
<i> Little girl: I just</i>
<i> want her to come home.</i>

358
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:40,924
<i> Grandmother: With love,</i>
<i> the future is yours to make.</i>

359
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,861
<i> Crypt architect: This is</i>
<i> an ode to the era we knew.</i>

360
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:48,765
<i> To live to see the</i>
<i> great day that dawns.</i>

361
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,902
<i> Little girl: No! No! No! No!</i>

362
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,239
<i> Grandmother: No.</i>

363
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,174
<i> Don't make this hard for me.</i>

364
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,742
<i> Little girl: She</i>
<i> can't go to sleep.</i>

365
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:02,545
<i> The bride: Let me see him. No!</i>

366
00:43:02,547 --> 00:43:05,882
<i> James, you've got to listen</i>
<i> to me, James, listen.</i>

367
00:43:05,884 --> 00:43:08,051
<i> I'm here now, alright?</i>

368
00:43:08,053 --> 00:43:09,519
<i> I'm going to give you my blood</i>

369
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:11,054
<i> and you're going</i>
<i> to be fine, okay?</i>

370
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,589
Stop!

371
00:43:12,591 --> 00:43:15,425
<i> The bride: Because I'm</i>
<i> not going to let you go.</i>

372
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:17,860
<i> You hear me?</i>

373
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:20,797
<i> I will never let go.</i>

374
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:24,534
<i> I'm not going to let you go.</i>

375
00:43:24,536 --> 00:43:26,302
<i> I love you</i>

376
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,610
<i> grandmother: It's just a</i>
<i> long walk you're going on.</i>

377
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,413
<i> Anywhere in the world</i>
<i> will be your home.</i>

378
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:40,783
<i> It's just a long walk</i>
<i> you're going on.</i>

379
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:44,287
This is the answer.

380
00:44:34,471 --> 00:44:36,372
Mari.

381
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,709
What's wrong with you?

382
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:43,880
They tried.

383
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:50,186
<i> They knew their time was up.</i>

384
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:54,724
Love.

385
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,529
That is to be human.

386
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,465
<i> To give and be vulnerable.</i>

387
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:04,133
This is no different.

388
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,868
<i> This is, cygnus!</i>

389
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,339
We have no future on
this wasted planet!

390
00:45:10,341 --> 00:45:12,208
No, you need to understand...

391
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:15,878
I saw the humans at the
end of their days.

392
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,582
If they can feel something,
why can't I?

393
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,390
It looks like you can.

394
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:08,831
I want to say something

395
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:12,602
but I don't know the words.

396
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:17,006
Show me.

397
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,702
Shh.

398
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:18,100
I thought you could
see everything

399
00:47:18,102 --> 00:47:20,036
<i> without looking.</i>

400
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,741
You still think i
can see everything?

401
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,844
Come in.

402
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,901
Why are you here?

403
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,173
I have a question

404
00:47:57,175 --> 00:47:59,242
about some kids.

405
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,011
What kids?

406
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,680
- Us.
- No.

407
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:06,015
Please, I...

408
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,817
I can't.

409
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:09,819
I insist.

410
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:12,455
You've been spending way
too many days alone.

411
00:48:14,324 --> 00:48:17,660
In fact, me being
here pestering you

412
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:19,495
is good for your health.

413
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:22,765
You are not good for my health.

414
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:28,838
You know, a game

415
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:32,074
can remind us how
to play in life.

416
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,413
- A game?
<i> - Yeah.</i>

417
00:48:38,048 --> 00:48:39,982
Okay, I...

418
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,385
I call this one

419
00:48:42,387 --> 00:48:44,053
want,

420
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:45,388
do,

421
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:47,590
remember.

422
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,592
<i> I'll start.</i>

423
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:53,896
I remember...

424
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,066
<i> It goes in that order.</i>

425
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,271
I remember...

426
00:49:03,907 --> 00:49:07,109
The last time you
were so focused.

427
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,212
You would sleep-walk
in the night

428
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:13,482
and always end up
outside of my hut.

429
00:49:15,887 --> 00:49:19,188
I wasn't thinking clearly.

430
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,459
Of course you weren't.

431
00:49:23,461 --> 00:49:25,328
You were asleep.

432
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,164
Okay, my turn.

433
00:49:28,598 --> 00:49:30,766
I remember...

434
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:32,902
When you

435
00:49:32,904 --> 00:49:35,471
were so caught up in your mind

436
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,907
that you forgot to
put the fire out

437
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,775
and you just about
burnt your hut down

438
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,911
and we had to save you.

439
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:43,279
I was meditating.

440
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:44,981
You were naked!

441
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:47,383
Doesn't change the fact.

442
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,654
You're next.

443
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,155
Now I'm done remembering.

444
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,296
The next is, uh,

445
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:02,698
want.

446
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,568
I...

447
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,374
I always wanted to

448
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,946
create a tablet that

449
00:50:16,948 --> 00:50:19,415
tells the seasons.

450
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:21,717
Hm.

451
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:27,256
I've always wanted

452
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,526
to spend more time
in the water.

453
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:32,728
Swimming deeply

454
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,165
where the world accepts me for

455
00:50:36,167 --> 00:50:38,200
all I am.

456
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:49,578
I accept you.

457
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:53,049
Since we were little.

458
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,286
They used to bother you.

459
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:01,791
You saw what others didn't.

460
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,064
I saw once that

461
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:12,101
those two could have
made quite a pair.

462
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:18,741
So did he.

463
00:51:31,855 --> 00:51:33,422
<i> One more thing.</i>

464
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:38,561
I didn't see this coming.

465
00:51:38,563 --> 00:51:41,263
And I can't see any further.

466
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,599
But I remember

467
00:51:43,601 --> 00:51:45,301
telling cygnus under a spell

468
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,304
<i> that somewhere dark,</i>

469
00:51:50,707 --> 00:51:53,943
where there is light
that has an answer

470
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,281
I think it had something
to do with all of us.

471
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:31,580
You know cygnus

472
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:34,650
lived a lonely life
in the shadow too.

473
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,221
I know you miss them, Elias.

474
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,893
Whatever is happening now

475
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:46,695
is more than any of us expected.

476
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:49,331
<i> Listen.</i>

477
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,734
<i> We don't have a choice now.</i>

478
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:56,338
There was a time when we
weren't surrounded by death.

479
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:59,608
<i> If cygnus finds a way</i>

480
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:02,378
<i> then we are along the trail.</i>

481
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,706
Cygnus: I see us.

482
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:33,242
This is who we are.

483
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,212
The people of land and water.

484
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,581
And that's it.

485
00:53:45,689 --> 00:53:47,756
There's nothing more.

486
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:52,228
<i> All we can do is move</i>
<i> across this place</i>

487
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,397
all we can do is move

488
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,734
and survive.

489
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,776
<i> Mari: Is that what</i>
<i> you were looking for?</i>

490
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,446
<i> Cygnus: Yes.</i>

491
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,575
Mari.

492
00:56:19,976 --> 00:56:22,711
You have to be careful
and protect yourself.

493
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:24,713
They won't stop
until someone's dead

494
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,715
and I do not want it to be you.

495
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:29,184
Cygnus.

496
00:56:29,186 --> 00:56:30,686
I'll teach you how to
get your bearings here

497
00:56:30,688 --> 00:56:32,321
so at least you
can get back.

498
00:56:32,323 --> 00:56:33,689
So if I'm captured--

499
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:35,023
cygnus, stop.

500
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:36,992
We don't know what's
going to happen

501
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:38,861
but as long as one of us
can make it back alive--

502
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,629
cygnus!

503
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:44,266
I was set up to kill you.

504
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:55,110
I had no choice.

505
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:04,753
I protected your life.

506
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,423
Mari: I know that.

507
00:57:08,525 --> 00:57:11,260
You are not who
i thought you were.

508
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:12,961
How would you know?

509
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,364
Because you brought me back.

510
00:57:15,366 --> 00:57:17,199
From what?

511
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,801
From dying.

512
00:57:21,037 --> 00:57:23,205
They took me in because
i knew how to kill

513
00:57:23,207 --> 00:57:25,274
and then they made
a deal with me.

514
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:32,414
It wasn't my intent to join

515
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,783
or belong or anything!

516
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,955
I went with them to
learn their secrets.

517
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:44,793
Where they hunt, where they
hide, and then I would vanish.

518
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,330
They set me up!

519
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,103
I hunt too.

520
00:57:55,105 --> 00:57:56,738
I'm just like you!

521
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:58,207
Yes!

522
00:57:58,575 --> 00:57:59,908
Yes!

523
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:02,110
I am a killer!

524
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:03,579
I kill!

525
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,414
I hunt! I skin!

526
00:58:05,416 --> 00:58:09,318
But when my life was on the
line, I didn't think of myself.

527
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:13,989
Everything I said to you
was the truth, mari.

528
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,992
Cygnus, I see you!

529
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,363
You are not who i
thought you were.

530
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,428
Just the old scars, please.

531
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,399
<i> Okay.</i>

532
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,369
Hmm.

533
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,638
<i> I believe</i>

534
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,673
<i> if I don't know the answer</i>

535
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:07,042
then my hands do.

536
00:59:11,347 --> 00:59:14,216
Good luck with your
archiving, shappa.

537
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:15,711
This...

538
01:00:15,713 --> 01:00:17,713
This is where...

539
01:00:17,715 --> 01:00:20,482
This is where they should
have been at the bluff.

540
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:25,287
This is the river here...

541
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,925
Ugh!

542
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,630
Where are you, cygnus?

543
01:01:47,837 --> 01:01:50,372
<i> Cygnus : They are right.</i>

544
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:53,375
<i> I am their hunter.</i>

545
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,046
<i> And I have a promise to keep.</i>

546
01:02:09,659 --> 01:02:11,960
Where does cygnus fit?

547
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:14,496
The river

548
01:02:14,498 --> 01:02:16,398
is over here.

549
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,203
Unh!

550
01:02:21,205 --> 01:02:23,238
Where did I go wrong?

551
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:46,261
Right there.

552
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,264
Right there.

553
01:03:22,398 --> 01:03:24,633
The snakes.

554
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,171
Cygnus.

555
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:34,142
The end.

556
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,481
It comes with him.

557
01:04:38,674 --> 01:04:41,109
- Shappa!
- Cygnus!

558
01:04:43,012 --> 01:04:45,180
What did you find?

559
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:47,649
I found what they left behind.

560
01:04:47,651 --> 01:04:50,385
You should think me
a scholar after all.

561
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:53,521
You're a hunter and
a damned good one.

562
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:55,557
I'm just glad you're back.

563
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,660
We'll see for how long.

564
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:00,395
Come on!

565
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,364
Are you still the hunter?

566
01:06:09,732 --> 01:06:12,467
Whatever I am,

567
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:15,170
after what I saw,

568
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,807
I see time differently now.

569
01:06:20,109 --> 01:06:21,743
When you was gone,

570
01:06:21,745 --> 01:06:23,912
I thought you had come
back in my dream.

571
01:06:23,914 --> 01:06:26,314
You was not killing no more.

572
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:36,324
You must have been dreaming.

573
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,761
You have to be ready

574
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:41,830
for what's about to happen.

575
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,566
You're going to go
for a long walk.

576
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,002
Okay?

577
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,939
Cygnus, I want to know

578
01:06:50,941 --> 01:06:53,241
where we go.

579
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,711
I know.

580
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,940
Is there a reason we haven't
scalped this village?

581
01:07:28,644 --> 01:07:30,045
Are you

582
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:33,114
questioning my authority again?

583
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,557
We don't know how many
are able to fight.

584
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:45,193
This isn't about them.

585
01:07:45,195 --> 01:07:47,228
It's about him, right?

586
01:07:47,230 --> 01:07:48,997
That's what you said.

587
01:07:48,999 --> 01:07:52,567
It has always been about them.

588
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:55,570
It's always been
about your sweet,

589
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,906
golden future.

590
01:07:57,908 --> 01:07:59,674
But

591
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,376
you,

592
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:03,478
you just want more.

593
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:06,014
What we want

594
01:08:06,016 --> 01:08:08,750
is for this to end!

595
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:12,020
You want.

596
01:08:12,022 --> 01:08:16,391
You want! And want!
And want! And want!

597
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,193
And want!!

598
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:19,694
What you want

599
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,196
is me!

600
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:23,465
You need me!

601
01:08:26,602 --> 01:08:28,937
You want the power, zizzik?

602
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,072
Then take this

603
01:08:31,074 --> 01:08:33,308
and go carve it out of them.

604
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,460
Almost there.

605
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:55,130
Almost there.

606
01:08:55,931 --> 01:08:58,233
So this crypt was
built by humans?

607
01:08:58,235 --> 01:09:00,702
Yes. And left for us.

608
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:06,307
Here.

609
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,476
It helped them get through

610
01:09:13,115 --> 01:09:14,883
Nova.

611
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,886
It's me that they're after.

612
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,689
How do you know this?

613
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:26,694
They would have killed me
when they had the chance.

614
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,922
Cygnus.

615
01:10:26,322 --> 01:10:29,390
And I thought you
were a lone wolf.

616
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,769
If you feel nothing,
then you survive.

617
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,441
But if you feel something...

618
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:50,979
Then you have something
to live for.

619
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:57,779
This

620
01:11:57,781 --> 01:12:00,214
is what you heart tells you?

621
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:04,752
Tell me how you met.

622
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:07,588
By the edge of the blade.

623
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,891
How everyone else does.

624
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:12,560
Hm.

625
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,762
But...

626
01:12:14,764 --> 01:12:16,898
But I saw you.

627
01:12:19,268 --> 01:12:21,736
I saw you too.

628
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:48,029
This

629
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:50,365
is the memories

630
01:12:51,467 --> 01:12:52,867
that live

631
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:55,236
where the blood bonds.

632
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:59,374
Your story will be great.

633
01:13:01,009 --> 01:13:03,211
Do not be afraid.

634
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,079
I never was.

635
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,552
My heart recognizes her.

636
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:13,988
She is welcome.

637
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,423
Ah! Ah!

638
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:57,999
They're coming!

639
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,269
They are coming!

640
01:14:03,872 --> 01:14:05,440
Warn them, warn them!

641
01:14:05,442 --> 01:14:07,308
They're sending the dead!

642
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:10,978
<i> Female villager: Where's</i>
<i> the children?</i>

643
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:26,961
<i> Female villager 2: </i>
<i> Where're the baby?</i>

644
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,263
If I don't come back,

645
01:14:29,265 --> 01:14:31,065
lead them some place safe.

646
01:14:31,067 --> 01:14:33,601
If you don't come back,
I'm coming after you.

647
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,970
No. They need you here.

648
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:39,373
<i> Torik: Cygnus!</i>

649
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,943
No matter how we leave,

650
01:14:41,945 --> 01:14:44,512
our echoes won't.

651
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:55,823
Nova!

652
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,021
Ahhh!

653
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:17,498
Look what beautiful
things you have done.

654
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:21,369
That's right, cygnus.

655
01:17:21,903 --> 01:17:24,805
Anything you've always done

656
01:17:24,807 --> 01:17:27,875
has always been right.

657
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,164
<i> Mari: Cygnus!</i>

658
01:17:58,940 --> 01:18:01,108
No. No.

659
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,510
No!

660
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:04,712
If you touch her,
i will kill you.

661
01:18:04,946 --> 01:18:07,548
I will kill you! No!

662
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:10,351
No! Run!

663
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:13,154
<i> Cygnus: Run!</i>

664
01:18:13,156 --> 01:18:15,523
Run back! No!

665
01:18:15,525 --> 01:18:16,957
No!

666
01:18:16,959 --> 01:18:18,959
Cygnus!

667
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:20,361
Ohh!

668
01:18:31,039 --> 01:18:32,540
Mari: He can't.

669
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,576
He needs to know what he is!

670
01:18:36,812 --> 01:18:39,046
Look at me. Come on,
stay with me.

671
01:18:39,048 --> 01:18:40,648
Stay with me.

672
01:18:40,650 --> 01:18:42,983
They say too much, mari.

673
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,886
I have to speak now!

674
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:48,889
I'm here. I'm here, Nova.
Nova, I'm here. Look at me.

675
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,225
Okay? Look at me.

676
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,094
I need to speak now.

677
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,404
Nova, what's happening to me!?

678
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,909
You belong to us too.

679
01:19:10,579 --> 01:19:13,114
We live through one another.

680
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,117
Look!

681
01:19:27,896 --> 01:19:29,964
My light is passing.

682
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,834
You have the ancestors
in your eyes.

683
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,171
You lead them.

684
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:43,177
Tell cygnus...

685
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:47,982
Tell him he always
belonged here.

686
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:52,386
He was never

687
01:19:52,388 --> 01:19:54,455
one of them

688
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,402
you hear that?

689
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:44,004
That voice

690
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:47,174
that screams "let go".

691
01:20:50,645 --> 01:20:52,847
You can't silence it.

692
01:20:53,114 --> 01:20:55,416
It's a part of you.

693
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,919
The horse never wanted you.

694
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:02,690
You had hope in your eye.

695
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:06,794
But every last one

696
01:21:06,796 --> 01:21:10,431
of those pathetic souls

697
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:13,367
will suffer the same fate

698
01:21:13,835 --> 01:21:17,037
as your snakes.

699
01:21:19,641 --> 01:21:21,876
You see...

700
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,811
Our stories

701
01:21:23,813 --> 01:21:25,779
are the same.

702
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:32,086
Do you see why she
never wanted you?

703
01:21:34,356 --> 01:21:36,390
Who?

704
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,060
Our mother.

705
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:46,700
No.

706
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:49,570
No.

707
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:52,406
No!

708
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:55,376
No!!!

709
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,745
Yes, brother!

710
01:22:02,384 --> 01:22:04,518
My entire life...

711
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,053
Everything!

712
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:08,055
All of this

713
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:09,990
has been you.

714
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,331
<i> You were never one of them.</i>

715
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,706
Aahh!!

716
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,493
Just like me!

717
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:52,967
You're just like me.

718
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:04,511
What are you waiting for!?

719
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:08,482
Get him off me.

720
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,487
I said get him off me!

721
01:23:13,489 --> 01:23:15,155
Where is the power you
promised us

722
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,825
to put the noose around
the killer's collar!?

723
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:19,293
<i> You took all you can!</i>

724
01:23:19,295 --> 01:23:22,997
You can't take us!

725
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,201
Where are you going!?

726
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:30,838
Where are you going!?

727
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:34,241
You can't walk away!

728
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:45,252
Where do you think you're going?

729
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:48,922
Cygnus!

730
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:54,328
Wait!

731
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:57,731
Wait! Wait! Wait-wait-wait!

732
01:23:58,967 --> 01:24:00,701
Who do you think

733
01:24:00,703 --> 01:24:02,403
kept you alive all this time?

734
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:07,107
Who looked out for you?

735
01:24:14,716 --> 01:24:17,651
I just wanted you

736
01:24:17,653 --> 01:24:20,587
to be like me.

737
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:25,359
This isn't for me.

738
01:24:25,361 --> 01:24:27,961
It's for them.

739
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:11,765
Courage is the only thing
you need where you're going.

740
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:14,001
Think I'll make it?

741
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:16,370
You've made it this far.

742
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:19,039
You'll see once you get there.

743
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,509
You're part of it too, you know?

744
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:25,412
See.

745
01:26:26,614 --> 01:26:28,182
It's a gift.

746
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:46,133
You brave little warrior.

747
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,177
<i> Cygnus : Nova.</i>

748
01:26:57,179 --> 01:27:00,714
<i> The answer is that we</i>
<i> are not out of time.</i>

749
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:03,250
<i> To feel is to live.</i>

750
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,552
<i> To feel is to continue.</i>

751
01:27:06,854 --> 01:27:10,257
<i>The last arc will find its way.</i>

752
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:13,293
<i> And maybe one day</i>
<i> I will find mine.</i>

753
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:27,307
What is the wind
telling you, cygnus?

754
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,981
It's harder to hear now.

755
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:38,151
Then

756
01:27:38,519 --> 01:27:41,321
something is about to change.

757
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:46,760
Will you come with us?

758
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,935
I've seen enough.

759
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:25,666
It's time we left.

760
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,970
Then where do we go?

761
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:34,541
We go north.
