00:02:19,124 --> 00:02:23,037
Help! Me house is on fire!
Me house is on fire!

2
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:29,361
Call the fire brigade!

3
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:39,277
Fill them up!

4
00:02:39,924 --> 00:02:41,437
Pass the bucket!

5
00:02:41,684 --> 00:02:44,596
There must be another way
of doing the credits!

6
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,038
That"s right!

7
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:50,436
Every time they make a Robin Hood
movie, they burn our village down.

8
00:03:00,444 --> 00:03:03,834
Leave us alone, Mel Brooks!

9
00:03:07,884 --> 00:03:10,717
Yo! Check it out
Prince John and the Sheriff

10
00:03:11,044 --> 00:03:12,238
They was running the show

11
00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,475
Raising the taxes
"Cause they needed the dough

12
00:03:14,724 --> 00:03:16,635
A reign of terror
Took over the land

13
00:03:16,884 --> 00:03:19,842
They was shaking down the people
Just to beat the band

14
00:03:20,044 --> 00:03:20,840
Hey!

15
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:22,803
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

16
00:03:23,684 --> 00:03:26,562
-I said Hey!
-Hey nonny nonny and a ho ho ho

17
00:03:30,964 --> 00:03:32,875
The people were unhappy
Morale was low

18
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:35,235
They had no place to turn to
There was nowhere to go

19
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:37,475
They needed a hero
But no one could be found

20
00:03:37,724 --> 00:03:40,602
"Cause Robin Hood was out of town
I said Hey!

21
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:41,793
Hey!

22
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:43,757
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

23
00:03:44,404 --> 00:03:47,680
-I said Hey!
-Hey nonny nonny and a ho ho ho

24
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,639
He was put into the slammer
By his Arab foe

25
00:03:53,884 --> 00:03:55,636
And in a little while
He would be no more

26
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,397
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

27
00:03:58,244 --> 00:03:59,757
-I said Hey!
-Hey!

28
00:04:00,564 --> 00:04:02,953
-I said Hey!
-Hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny

29
00:04:03,204 --> 00:04:06,082
Hey nonny nonny and a ho ho ho

31
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:43,034

l"m so sorry, but we cannot seat you

40
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:12,313

That"s much better. Now, l leave you

42
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:23,482
He"s our head guard.

Follow me.

48
00:05:45,284 --> 00:05:46,763
Please sit.

49
00:05:50,484 --> 00:05:51,917
Robin of Loxley...

50
00:05:52,164 --> 00:05:54,120
...where is your king?

51
00:05:55,084 --> 00:05:55,880
King?

52
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,273
King?

53
00:05:57,484 --> 00:06:01,159
And which king might that be?
King Richard? King Louis?

54
00:06:01,404 --> 00:06:02,996
King Kong?

55
00:06:03,284 --> 00:06:04,763
Larry King?

56
00:06:05,244 --> 00:06:07,917
lmpertinent English dog.

57
00:06:08,164 --> 00:06:09,153
You shall talk.

58
00:06:09,644 --> 00:06:11,396
l don"t think so.

59
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:13,958
Churchim...

60
00:06:14,324 --> 00:06:17,077
...please, the tongue looseners.

61
00:06:23,124 --> 00:06:24,113
Speak, you dog.

62
00:06:24,324 --> 00:06:25,723
Speak!

63
00:06:35,804 --> 00:06:37,203
What did he say?

64
00:06:38,124 --> 00:06:39,637
You don"t wanna know.

65
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:52,233
You very brave for not a homeboy.

66
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:53,837
Thank you.

67
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:58,243
l"ve been in this place for a while.
Perhaps l can be of service.

68
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:00,156
Do you have any questions?

69
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,032
What are you in for?

70
00:07:03,284 --> 00:07:04,637
Jaywalking.

71
00:07:06,044 --> 00:07:06,840
l see.

72
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,514
lt won"t be easy getting out of here.

73
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:19,682
What we need is a great
feat of strength.

74
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,921
Feat of strength?

75
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:24,240
Au contraire!

76
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:29,154
Now that you"re here with me, what we
have is great strength of feet!

77
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,238
Don"t follow.

78
00:07:32,444 --> 00:07:33,672
Do as l do.

79
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:36,674
Put your feet on the bar.
Both feet.

80
00:07:36,884 --> 00:07:39,796
Now, on the count of kick.

81
00:07:40,924 --> 00:07:42,039
Kick!

82
00:07:45,764 --> 00:07:46,879
What was that noise?

83
00:07:47,084 --> 00:07:48,563
Noise? Noise?

84
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:53,833
The noise you heard was the breaking
of this poor man"s heart.

85
00:07:54,044 --> 00:07:55,238
Yes, that"s it!

86
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:57,272
What?

87
00:07:57,524 --> 00:08:00,641
He"s decided to save his own life
by betraying his king.

88
00:08:01,084 --> 00:08:02,722
Oh, yes. That"s it.

89
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:04,881
Oh, damn my eyes!

90
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:08,037
Go tell your superiors
before he changes his mind.

91
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:10,917
By the love of Allah!
This is a wonderful thing!

92
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,234
Go!

93
00:08:13,524 --> 00:08:15,799
lt will mean a big promotion for me!

94
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:17,918
Go!

95
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,874
Good news is always rewarded!

96
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,517
Please go.

97
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,836
On the other hand...

98
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,633
...bad news is severely punished.

99
00:08:39,324 --> 00:08:40,996
Now is our chance.

100
00:08:43,124 --> 00:08:46,434
Quick, follow me!
You get that chain, l"ll get this one.

101
00:08:50,524 --> 00:08:52,515
-l"m free!
-You"re free!

102
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:57,193

103
00:09:11,604 --> 00:09:13,242
Come on, take my hand!

104
00:09:20,324 --> 00:09:23,999
On the count of three!
One! Two! Three!

105
00:09:33,924 --> 00:09:36,882
l just told them the good news,
and...

106
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:38,519
...and....

107
00:09:40,404 --> 00:09:42,360
And l"m in deep shit.

108
00:09:58,524 --> 00:10:01,960
lt is a very long journey
from Africa to England, my friend.

109
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:03,114
Well...

110
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:08,083
...l owe you a debt of gratitude.
l am called Robin of Loxley.

111
00:10:08,324 --> 00:10:11,282
My name is Asneeze, father of Ahchoo.

112
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:12,519
Bless you.

113
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:16,555
Ahchoo is my son.
He"s in England, your country.

114
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:18,601
He"s an exchange student.

115
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:21,034
l"d like you to look after him.

116
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:25,960
He is in need of guidance.
He is headstrong and cocksure.

117
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:29,034
Or is it the other way around?

118
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:30,553
Say no more.

119
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:34,399
l vow on the sacred word of Loxley.
l give you my undying pledge...

120
00:10:34,644 --> 00:10:38,637
...my solemn oath on my father"s honour,
on the blood of my heart...

121
00:10:38,884 --> 00:10:43,036
-...on the word of my soul--
-Good, good, good!

122
00:10:43,284 --> 00:10:46,515
You must go now,
or you will miss the tide.

123
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, farewell, my friend,
and not to worry.

124
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:52,597
l"ll find Ahchoo.

125
00:10:53,364 --> 00:10:54,558
Goodbye, my friend.

126
00:10:54,804 --> 00:10:55,634
Farewell!

127
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:57,482
Safe journey!

128
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:31,193
Home!

129
00:11:31,924 --> 00:11:33,073
Home!

130
00:11:33,804 --> 00:11:35,476
England!

131
00:11:51,804 --> 00:11:52,839
A horse!

132
00:11:53,084 --> 00:11:55,837
A horse! My kingdom for a horse!

133
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:20,640
Ahchoo?

134
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,081
Bless you!

135
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:30,399
l hope someone"s getting
the video of this.

136
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:37,279
That must be him.

137
00:12:43,604 --> 00:12:44,753
Watch my back!

138
00:12:48,404 --> 00:12:50,201
Your back just got punched twice.

139
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:52,153
Thank you.

140
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:00,553
Hey, thanks, man.

141
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:01,919
You"re welcome.

142
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:04,523
Who are you anyway?

143
00:13:05,124 --> 00:13:07,638
l think now is not the time
for introductions.

144
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,119
Time-out!

145
00:13:09,364 --> 00:13:12,515
Excuse me, bad guys.
l am running out of air.

146
00:13:12,924 --> 00:13:14,642
Gotta get pumped.

147
00:13:21,524 --> 00:13:23,879
Okay, honkies. Time in!

148
00:13:24,124 --> 00:13:25,239
By the bye...

149
00:13:25,564 --> 00:13:28,874
...do you know praying mantis?

150
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:30,438
You"re looking at him.

151
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:49,281
Let"s get out of here!

152
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:52,083
Yeah, boy!

153
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:54,235
Right, go ahead! Punk!

154
00:13:54,484 --> 00:13:55,678
They"re witches!

155
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:57,994
-They"re possessed!
-They"re crazy!

156
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:01,794
-Good work.
-Thanks, man.

157
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:09,003
You haven"t seen the last of us!

158
00:14:20,644 --> 00:14:22,953
You"ve seen the last of us.

159
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,479
There she is, Loxley Hall.

160
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,760
Home of my family
for seven generations.

161
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:42,196
Let"s go!

162
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,879
Move it!
Come on, let"s go!

163
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:47,035
That"s a boy! Let"s go! Move it!

164
00:14:47,644 --> 00:14:49,600
That"s it.
Keep it going!

165
00:14:49,844 --> 00:14:51,482
Keep it going!

166
00:14:51,884 --> 00:14:54,682
Come on, come on!
Move it, move it!

167
00:14:54,964 --> 00:14:57,194
-Here we go.
-Stop the castle!

168
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:02,596
You, there! l demand to know
what is going on here!

169
00:15:03,164 --> 00:15:04,677
Read it and weep.

170
00:15:07,924 --> 00:15:09,118
What up with that?

171
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:11,318
" Hear ye, hear ye.

172
00:15:11,724 --> 00:15:15,194
For failure to pay taxes,
all the lands and properties...

173
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:17,833
...of the Loxley family
shall be taken.

174
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,360
Signed, Prince John"s Royal
Accountant, H.M.R. Blockhead."

175
00:15:21,604 --> 00:15:26,075
This is a sham! l vow l will restore
my castle to its rightful place.

176
00:15:26,284 --> 00:15:28,559
You vow, we move!

177
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:32,399
Let"s go, boys! Take it out!

178
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:37,399
Come on!

179
00:15:37,684 --> 00:15:38,958
Move it!

180
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,883
Keep it going!

181
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:42,842
Come on!

182
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:45,200
That"s a boy!

183
00:15:59,524 --> 00:16:00,673
Blinkin?

184
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:02,239
Who"s that?

185
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:05,635
lt"s Blinkin,
our family"s loyal blind servant.

186
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:10,119
-l gotta get the horse, man.
-Good.

187
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,403
Be right out!

188
00:16:18,524 --> 00:16:20,003
Blinkin!

189
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:22,678
Master Robin, is that you?

190
00:16:23,044 --> 00:16:25,114
Back from the Crusades?

191
00:16:25,324 --> 00:16:27,121
And alive?

192
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,035
Happy day!

193
00:16:33,964 --> 00:16:36,319
l"m quite sure there was a door there.

194
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,435
Master Robin!

195
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:42,472
You lost your arms in battle!

196
00:16:42,724 --> 00:16:44,840
Oh, how terrible!

197
00:16:45,084 --> 00:16:46,961
But you grew some nice boobs!

198
00:16:47,204 --> 00:16:49,320
Blinkin, l"m over here.

199
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:51,637
Later.

200
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:55,839
Listen to me.
They"ve taken the castle!

201
00:16:56,804 --> 00:16:59,876
l thought it felt a bit drafty.

202
00:17:01,124 --> 00:17:04,639
This never would"ve happened
if your father was alive.

203
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,318
He"s dead?

204
00:17:06,644 --> 00:17:07,838
Yes!

205
00:17:08,204 --> 00:17:09,273
And my mother?

206
00:17:09,524 --> 00:17:13,278
She died of pneumonia whilst--
Oh, you were away.

207
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:14,838
My brothers?

208
00:17:15,084 --> 00:17:17,200
They were all killed by the plague.

209
00:17:18,364 --> 00:17:19,638
My dog, Pongo?

210
00:17:19,884 --> 00:17:21,954
Run over by a carriage.

211
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:23,603
My goldfish, Goldie?

212
00:17:24,324 --> 00:17:25,996
Eaten by the cat.

213
00:17:26,604 --> 00:17:27,798
My cat?

214
00:17:28,084 --> 00:17:30,075
Choked on the goldfish.

215
00:17:31,724 --> 00:17:35,034
lt"s good to be home,
ain"t it, Master Robin?

216
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:39,041
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

217
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:41,043
What is that?

218
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:45,357
Your father wanted me
to give you this.

219
00:17:45,604 --> 00:17:47,959
He said that inside is the key...

220
00:17:48,204 --> 00:17:51,480
...to the greatest treasure
in all the land.

221
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:53,797
May l keep it?

222
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:57,763
No, l think l ought
to honour my father"s wishes.

223
00:17:58,004 --> 00:17:59,483
Of course.

224
00:18:10,124 --> 00:18:11,273
Come, Blinkin.

225
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:14,277
Let us leave this
depressing foundation.

226
00:18:14,524 --> 00:18:17,721
We have much to do,
and less time to do it in.

227
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:22,603
Hey, Robin, wait up.

228
00:18:23,284 --> 00:18:24,319
Oh. Well done.

229
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:26,480
He"s fast, but l caught his ass.

230
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:30,080
-Who"s that?
-Blinkin, l"d like you to meet Ahchoo.

231
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,916
A Jew? Here?

232
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:34,673
No, no. Not a Jew. Ahchoo.

233
00:18:34,884 --> 00:18:36,283
Hey, put it there.

234
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:37,639
How do you do?

235
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,363
l"ve been better.

236
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,083
What"s that?

237
00:18:41,484 --> 00:18:43,520
Help me! Help me!

238
00:18:44,204 --> 00:18:45,353
Save me!

239
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:46,832
Save me!

240
00:18:51,324 --> 00:18:53,280
Looks like a runaway white boy.

241
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:56,118
All right, steady on.
What"s the matter?

242
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:57,683
They"re after me.

243
00:18:57,924 --> 00:18:59,243
Who is?

244
00:19:14,644 --> 00:19:16,362
Over that boy hand!

245
00:19:20,404 --> 00:19:23,123
Hand over that boy.

246
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:24,874
Who demands it?

247
00:19:25,124 --> 00:19:27,115
The Sheriff of Rottingham.

248
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:32,321
What has the boy done?

249
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:36,921
He was poaching in the king"s forest.
He deered to kill a king"s dare.

250
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:42,520
Dared to kill a king"s deer.

251
00:19:43,924 --> 00:19:45,437
And this is an offence?

252
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,279
One punishable by death.
Where have you been?

253
00:19:49,524 --> 00:19:52,118
Fighting with King Richard
in the Crusades.

254
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:56,516
Unfortunately, my father couldn"t
get me into the National Guard.

255
00:19:59,404 --> 00:20:02,601
How dare you talk to me in that fashion!
Who are you?

256
00:20:03,404 --> 00:20:04,962
l am Robin of Loxley.

257
00:20:05,764 --> 00:20:08,722
l"ve heard of you.
They say you"re handy with a sword.

258
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:10,716
Let"s find out!

259
00:20:19,604 --> 00:20:20,559
What happened?

260
00:20:24,164 --> 00:20:26,632
l was angry at you before, Loxley...

261
00:20:26,884 --> 00:20:28,954
...but now l"m really pissed off!

262
00:20:29,204 --> 00:20:30,114
Pissed off?

263
00:20:30,524 --> 00:20:34,597
lf l was that close to a horse"s wiener,
l"d worry about getting pissed on.

264
00:20:35,764 --> 00:20:38,961
This wasn"t a very smart thing
for you to have done.

265
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,762
l"ll pay for this!

266
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:45,914
You"ll pay for this!

267
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:47,392
Kill them!

268
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:52,953
Wait!

269
00:20:53,204 --> 00:20:54,523
l"ve changed my mind.

270
00:20:55,844 --> 00:20:56,993
Wise decision.

271
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:00,437
So until we meet again...

272
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,677
...have a safe journey.

273
00:21:06,124 --> 00:21:07,876
Mind the big rocks!

274
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,917
Shut up, you bloody fools!

275
00:21:16,604 --> 00:21:18,674
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

276
00:21:20,804 --> 00:21:23,034
Thank you for saving me life, me lord.

277
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,117
l"ll tell every man that
there is one who is not afraid...

278
00:21:26,324 --> 00:21:28,042
...to stand up to Rottingham.

279
00:21:28,444 --> 00:21:33,154
Good. Tell them that. And tell them
l vow to put an end to the injustice.

280
00:21:33,404 --> 00:21:35,759
Right the wrongs. End the tyranny.

281
00:21:36,004 --> 00:21:37,483
Restore the throne.

282
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,033
Protect the forest.

283
00:21:39,764 --> 00:21:41,322
lntroduce folk dancing.

284
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:46,560
Demand a four-day workweek and health
care for Saxons and Normans.

285
00:21:46,804 --> 00:21:47,873
Yes, yes!
Good, good.

286
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:52,242
lt"s getting dark, and l got
to go home alone now.

287
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:53,673
Right, right.

288
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,241
What an unusual child.

289
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:09,792
Where is the one

290
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:14,363
That I love most of all?

291
00:22:14,804 --> 00:22:18,001
When will I hear him call

292
00:22:18,244 --> 00:22:21,316
Marian, Marian?

293
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,677
He is the one

294
00:22:24,924 --> 00:22:27,563
Who can make my life whole

295
00:22:29,244 --> 00:22:32,873
Joyful forevermore

296
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:37,715
I"ve waited so patiently

297
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:41,036
For a true love

298
00:22:41,604 --> 00:22:44,880
When will he come for me?

299
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,392
Where is he?

300
00:22:46,644 --> 00:22:48,316
Where is he?

301
00:22:54,284 --> 00:22:56,923
Where is the man

302
00:22:57,164 --> 00:23:00,634
Who carries the key?

303
00:23:01,724 --> 00:23:03,680
When will he be:::

304
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:08,315
::: with his Marian, Marian?

305
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:11,677
I cannot wait

306
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,643
Till he sets my heart free

307
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:19,957
Oh, when will I know him?

308
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:23,841
When will I see him?

309
00:23:24,324 --> 00:23:27,760
When will I hear him:::

310
00:23:28,044 --> 00:23:32,196
:::say "Marian, my love"?

311
00:23:37,324 --> 00:23:39,360
Hurry up, mein lady!

312
00:23:39,604 --> 00:23:44,280
You better get out of that tub
before that thing begins to rust.

313
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:47,076
All right, Broomhilde.

314
00:23:51,324 --> 00:23:52,279
Hurry! Hurry!

315
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:53,394
lt"s freezing!

316
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:01,952
Button up.
You"ll catch your death of cold.

317
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:05,084
These castles are so drafty.

318
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:10,596
Toasty warm.

319
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:15,636
Broomhilde, look!

320
00:24:15,844 --> 00:24:17,994
A happy little bluebird.

321
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:29,313
This means l must make a wish.

322
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:32,279
l hope against hope...

323
00:24:32,684 --> 00:24:34,640
...l wish against wish...

324
00:24:34,844 --> 00:24:38,553
...that the heavens bring me a kind,
wonderful, gentle man...

325
00:24:38,804 --> 00:24:40,874
...who possesses the key to my...

326
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:44,913
...heart.

327
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:48,035
Goodbye, my little friend.

328
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:54,035
That happy little bluebird has left
a happy little doo-doo on your hand.

329
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:10,279
Prince John, l must speak with you!

330
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:13,918
All right, everybody.
Later, later.

331
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:16,803
Later.

332
00:25:21,884 --> 00:25:23,033
Sire...

333
00:25:24,204 --> 00:25:25,796
...l have news.

334
00:25:26,964 --> 00:25:31,242
What sort of news? Not bad news.
You know l can"t take bad news.

335
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:35,523
The day began so good. l had a good
night"s sleep. l had a good b.m.

336
00:25:35,764 --> 00:25:37,675
l don"t wanna hear any bad news.

337
00:25:38,084 --> 00:25:40,439
Now what type of news is it?

338
00:25:40,844 --> 00:25:42,675
To be perfectly frank, it"s bad.

339
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:45,158
l knew it!

340
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:47,800
l knew it was bad news!

341
00:25:51,044 --> 00:25:53,353
Wait a minute, l have an idea.

342
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:58,041
Maybe if you tell me the bad news
in a good way, it won"t sound so bad.

343
00:25:59,964 --> 00:26:01,761
The bad news in a good way?

344
00:26:02,004 --> 00:26:03,437
Yes, yes, l can do that.

345
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:06,073
The bad news in a good way, yes.

346
00:26:06,404 --> 00:26:07,314
Well, here goes.

347
00:26:11,764 --> 00:26:14,483
Wait till you hear this.
l just saw Robin of Loxley.

348
00:26:14,724 --> 00:26:16,601
He"s back from the Crusades.

349
00:26:17,404 --> 00:26:21,716
You know, he just beat the crap
out of me and my men!

350
00:26:24,444 --> 00:26:28,517
You know, he hates you
and he loves your brother, Richard.

351
00:26:36,124 --> 00:26:38,115
And he wants to see you hanged!

352
00:26:43,404 --> 00:26:45,076
We"re in a lot of trouble.

353
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:50,322
What are you, crazy?

354
00:26:51,284 --> 00:26:54,356
Why are you laughing?
This is terrible news!

355
00:26:55,084 --> 00:26:59,236
Well, l was just trying
to soften the blow.

356
00:27:00,044 --> 00:27:01,841
Well, you blew it.

357
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:04,393
This is a knotty problem
not easily solved.

358
00:27:04,644 --> 00:27:06,123
Yes, you"re right.

359
00:27:07,164 --> 00:27:10,713
What to do? What to do?

360
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,795
What to do?

361
00:27:13,764 --> 00:27:16,119
Got it! Latrine!

362
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:21,116
The weird creature in the tower.
The one who predicts my future.

363
00:27:21,364 --> 00:27:22,592
Oh, yes, Latrine.

364
00:27:22,844 --> 00:27:24,482
ls she ugly!

365
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:30,434
Latrine!

366
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:33,482
Latrine, where are you?
l must talk with you!

367
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:36,439
lt"s you.

368
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:39,553
There"s a new threat to my power.

369
00:27:39,764 --> 00:27:42,232
What can you tell me
about Robin of Loxley?

370
00:27:42,484 --> 00:27:43,394
Robin of Loxley?

371
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:45,396
Robin of Loxley.

372
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:47,003
Let me see.

373
00:27:48,964 --> 00:27:50,875
Raven"s egg.

374
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:53,395
Blood of a hen.

375
00:27:53,844 --> 00:27:55,516
Little bit more blood, yes.

376
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,800
Eyeballs of a crocodile.

377
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:04,078
Testicles of a newt.

378
00:28:04,364 --> 00:28:06,798
l guess he"s a transsexual now.

379
00:28:18,284 --> 00:28:21,321
Robin of Loxley is handsome and brave.

380
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:24,522
He seeks to regain his family"s honour.

381
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:28,236
The little sod could be trouble.

382
00:28:28,484 --> 00:28:30,122
-Are you certain?
-Certain?

383
00:28:30,364 --> 00:28:33,276
You want certain, hire a witch.
l"m just your cook.

384
00:28:33,564 --> 00:28:34,394
Here.

385
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:35,963
Eat this.

386
00:28:37,484 --> 00:28:39,122
lt"s fabulous.

387
00:28:39,364 --> 00:28:42,117
Looks like a Seder
at Vincent Price"s house.

388
00:28:49,564 --> 00:28:53,034
Such an unusual name, Latrine.
How did your family come by it?

389
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:55,639
We changed it in the ninth century.

390
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:59,242
You mean you changed it to Latrine?

391
00:29:00,604 --> 00:29:03,277
Yeah, it used to be Shithouse.

392
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:06,640
lt"s a good change.

393
00:29:06,884 --> 00:29:09,352
lt"s a good change.

394
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:13,600
Now, what about this Robin fellow?

395
00:29:13,804 --> 00:29:14,873
How can l stop him?

396
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:17,237
Maybe...

397
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:20,317
...l could devise a magic potion.

398
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:24,041
One that would make him unable
to perform the slightest task.

399
00:29:25,284 --> 00:29:26,239
But in return...

400
00:29:26,804 --> 00:29:28,237
...you must help me.

401
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:31,999
What are you, kidding?
Name it. Anything you want.

402
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:36,034
Put in a good word for me
with the Sheriff of Rottingham.

403
00:29:36,244 --> 00:29:38,599
l"ve got the hots for him.

404
00:29:42,764 --> 00:29:45,676
l keep a likeness of him
in my boudoir.

405
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:49,794
Rotty.

406
00:29:50,044 --> 00:29:52,399
Rotty, Rotty, Rotty.

407
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:57,759
l"m amazed to think that a handsome
blade like the Sheriff of Rottingham...

408
00:29:58,164 --> 00:30:00,439
...would ever want a creature
like you.

409
00:30:02,204 --> 00:30:05,879
Well, if you"re going
to puncture my dreams...

410
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:08,552
...you can forget my promise
to help you!

411
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:09,759
No, wait!

412
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:12,916
Wait, wait, wait!

413
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:16,359
Maybe if we got him drunk.

414
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:22,680
Very drunk.

415
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,996
You got a shot.

416
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:32,756
Oh, good.

417
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:50,153
Dismount.

418
00:30:54,684 --> 00:30:57,881
Wait here.
l"ll go make sure it"s safe.

419
00:31:15,404 --> 00:31:18,794
l say, would you mind awfully
getting out of the way?

420
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:22,354
l say, not until you pay the toll.

421
00:31:22,764 --> 00:31:24,482
Toll? What toll?

422
00:31:24,844 --> 00:31:28,234
Well, the toll you pay
for crossing me bridge.

423
00:31:28,484 --> 00:31:30,281
l"m not paying any toll.

424
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:32,401
This bridge is on my family"s land.

425
00:31:32,644 --> 00:31:35,204
Well, it used to be my family"s land.

426
00:31:37,084 --> 00:31:39,075
You"re Robin of Loxley!

427
00:31:42,684 --> 00:31:44,276
And whom might you be?

428
00:31:44,524 --> 00:31:46,401
They call me Little John.

429
00:31:46,644 --> 00:31:48,475
But don"t let my name fool you.

430
00:31:48,724 --> 00:31:49,793
ln real life...

431
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:51,636
...l"m very big.

432
00:31:52,484 --> 00:31:54,839
l"ll take your word for it.
Now, let me pass.

433
00:31:58,764 --> 00:31:59,799
Sorry.

434
00:32:00,164 --> 00:32:01,438
But a toll is a toll...

435
00:32:01,684 --> 00:32:03,322
...and a roll is a roll.

436
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:06,761
And if we don"t get no tolls,
then we don"t eat no rolls.

437
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:09,723
l made that up.

438
00:32:10,684 --> 00:32:14,597
lt"s very fascinating, but l"m
afraid l"m going to have to hurt you.

439
00:32:15,284 --> 00:32:16,876
My pleasure. Will!

440
00:32:24,044 --> 00:32:24,920
Thank you.

441
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:27,632
Hey, Blinkin.

442
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:29,920
Did you say, "Abe Lincoln"?

443
00:32:30,164 --> 00:32:33,076
No, l didn"t say, "Abe Lincoln."
l said, " Hey, Blinkin."

444
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,081
Hold the reins, man.

445
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:37,473
Damn.

446
00:32:41,564 --> 00:32:43,600
-Excuse me.
-No, excuse me.

447
00:32:43,844 --> 00:32:45,675
You don"t have to do this.

448
00:32:45,924 --> 00:32:46,834
Look...

449
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,952
...this ain"t exactly the Mississippi!

450
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:52,037
l"m on one side, see?

451
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:53,683
l"m on the other side.

452
00:32:53,884 --> 00:32:55,317
l"m on the east bank.

453
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:57,202
l"m on the west bank.

454
00:32:57,724 --> 00:32:59,874
lt is not that critical.

455
00:33:00,684 --> 00:33:03,562
Not the point.
lt"s the principal of the thing.

456
00:33:07,284 --> 00:33:08,922
Nice knowing you.

457
00:34:23,204 --> 00:34:24,398
Help me!

458
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:25,963
l can"t swim!

459
00:34:26,484 --> 00:34:29,442
l"m drowning!
Oh, God, l"m drowning!

460
00:34:32,284 --> 00:34:33,399
Help me!

461
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:37,077
Help! Help me!

462
00:34:37,564 --> 00:34:39,839
Help me! Oh, God!
Oh, God!

463
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:42,393
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

464
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,274
There, there. You"re all right now.

465
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:51,477
Thank you, Robin.

466
00:34:51,804 --> 00:34:53,476
You saved me life.

467
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:56,595
-What?
-Air!

468
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:58,633
Sorry.

469
00:34:58,884 --> 00:35:01,000
There. l"m in your debit.

470
00:35:01,364 --> 00:35:04,436
-Think nothing of it.
-Are you all right?

471
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:08,235
Let me introduce you to my friends.
That is Blinkin...

472
00:35:09,364 --> 00:35:10,479
...and this is Ahchoo.

473
00:35:10,724 --> 00:35:12,157
Bless you.

474
00:35:12,684 --> 00:35:14,834
That"s my name, man.

475
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,752
Let me introduce you
to my best friend.

476
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:20,914
Will Scarlet.

477
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:22,877
Scarlet"s my middle name.

478
00:35:23,124 --> 00:35:26,241
My full name is Will Scarlet O"Hara.

479
00:35:29,804 --> 00:35:31,362
We"re from Georgia.

480
00:35:31,564 --> 00:35:33,316
He"s deadly with his daggers.

481
00:35:33,564 --> 00:35:36,032
Really? How"s about a demonstration?

482
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:37,639
Gladly.

483
00:35:50,084 --> 00:35:51,437
Fire an arrow...

484
00:35:51,684 --> 00:35:53,481
...straight at my heart.

485
00:35:55,004 --> 00:35:56,403
Are you serious?

486
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:58,163
Absolutely.

487
00:36:05,284 --> 00:36:06,080
Goodbye.

488
00:36:14,244 --> 00:36:17,600
What part of Georgia you from?
South Central?

489
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:28,399
l haven"t quite figured
that part out yet.

490
00:36:30,844 --> 00:36:32,038
l see.

491
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,964
l"m sorry about the toll thing, Robin.

492
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:37,677
lt"s Prince John.

493
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:42,156
He"s taken our homes and everything
we own. We"ve nothing left.

494
00:36:42,604 --> 00:36:44,117
Not to worry, Little John.

495
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:48,118
l"m planning to make trouble for
Prince John and Rottingham.

496
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:50,400
Tonight, l"ll crash their party...

497
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:53,681
...to tell them l"ll fight to rid
England of their tyranny!

498
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:55,437
Good! We"ll join you!

499
00:36:55,684 --> 00:36:56,912
Hear, hear!

500
00:36:57,804 --> 00:37:01,717
l can"t risk the lives of others.
One can get in more easily than six.

501
00:37:04,084 --> 00:37:05,403
l must be off.

502
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,198
Fare thee well.
l"ll see thee upon my return.

503
00:37:08,444 --> 00:37:10,321
All right, man. Peace, bro.

504
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:11,833
Take it easy.

505
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:21,883
Man, white men can"t jump.

506
00:37:29,284 --> 00:37:31,434
-Here you are, son.
-Your ticket, sir.

507
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:08,520
Kill him!

508
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:11,723
No, wait!

509
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:13,803
You know, a mime...

510
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:16,478
...is a terrible thing to waste.

511
00:38:18,284 --> 00:38:19,637
Let him go.

512
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:29,083
Good evening, lady.

513
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:30,637
Lovely!

514
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:38,278
Maid Marian...

515
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,799
...you know our good
Sheriff of Rottingham?

516
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:43,194
You look ravishing, my dear.

517
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:51,878
Please allow me to help you
to your seat.

518
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:03,642
l must say that Prince John has spared
no expense for tonight"s party.

519
00:39:03,884 --> 00:39:08,036
We have exotic foods from across
the seas. Coconuts, bananas...

520
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:11,082
...and dates.
Would you care for a date?

521
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:14,082
-Yes, thank you.
-How about next Thursday?

522
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,320
Good evening.

523
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,915
That"s him! That"s him!

524
00:39:24,844 --> 00:39:26,357
That"s Loxley!

525
00:39:41,884 --> 00:39:43,397
Greetings, Your Highness.

526
00:39:45,844 --> 00:39:46,833
Tref.

527
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:49,234
A present for you and your guests.

528
00:39:49,484 --> 00:39:50,997
That"s a wild boar!

529
00:39:51,204 --> 00:39:55,197
No, no. That"s a wild pig.
That"s a wild bore.

530
00:39:56,484 --> 00:39:57,280
Funny!

531
00:39:58,164 --> 00:39:59,199
Very amusing!

532
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:03,314
So you"re Robin of Loxley, huh?

533
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:08,877
l"ve heard so much about you.

534
00:40:10,004 --> 00:40:10,914
And you are?

535
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:12,683
Maid Marian.

536
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:15,072
Maid Marian.

537
00:40:15,684 --> 00:40:18,244
Rumours of your beauty have travelled
far and wide.

538
00:40:18,484 --> 00:40:20,998
Yet l see they hardly do you justice.

539
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:23,198
What a smoothie!

540
00:40:23,644 --> 00:40:26,078
He"s definitely a smoothie.

541
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,033
Enough!

542
00:40:30,204 --> 00:40:31,922
King illegal forest...

543
00:40:32,164 --> 00:40:33,438
...to pig wild...

544
00:40:33,684 --> 00:40:35,800
...kill in it a is--

545
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:37,757
What?

546
00:40:38,164 --> 00:40:39,597
l mean, don"t you know?

547
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,922
lt is illegal to kill wild pig
in the king"s forest!

548
00:40:44,164 --> 00:40:47,201
ls it not also illegal
to sit in the king"s throne...

549
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,201
...and usurp his power in his absence?

550
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:51,634
Careful, Robin! You go too far.

551
00:40:51,884 --> 00:40:53,112
l"ve only just begun.

552
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,834
l"m warning you, if you don"t stop
levying these taxes...

553
00:40:57,084 --> 00:40:59,473
...l"ll lead the people
in a revolt against you.

554
00:41:01,244 --> 00:41:03,997
And why should the people
listen to you?

555
00:41:04,204 --> 00:41:07,594
Because unlike some
other Robin Hoods...

556
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:10,483
...l can speak with an English accent.

557
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:17,238
To tell you the truth, this guy"s
starting to get on my nerves!

558
00:41:17,484 --> 00:41:19,076
Worry not, Your Highness.

559
00:41:19,324 --> 00:41:22,953
l shall dispose of this
feathered upstart.

560
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:26,916
l challenge you to a duel.

561
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:38,319
l accept.

562
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:45,958
That"s going to cost you, Loxley!

563
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,803
Please put it on my bill.

564
00:41:48,004 --> 00:41:49,881
So it"s come down to this, has it?

565
00:41:50,084 --> 00:41:51,517
A fight to the death...

566
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:54,119
...mano a mano...

567
00:41:54,364 --> 00:41:55,353
...man to man...

568
00:41:56,004 --> 00:41:59,076
...just you and me and my...

569
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:00,359
...guards!

570
00:42:08,644 --> 00:42:10,635
Check please, table one.

571
00:42:42,204 --> 00:42:44,035
Hurry! Let"s get out of here!

572
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:18,079
-Refreshment, sir?
-Thank you, Blinkin.

573
00:43:19,924 --> 00:43:22,392
Sounds like we"re winning, sir.

574
00:43:22,884 --> 00:43:24,522
lndeed we are. Carry on.

575
00:43:30,884 --> 00:43:33,034
Save me! Save me!
Hurt them! Hurt them!

576
00:43:33,284 --> 00:43:36,162
Save them, save them!
Hurt you, hurt you! l"ve got it.

577
00:43:50,404 --> 00:43:52,156
Care for some dessert?

578
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,799
Archers ready!

579
00:43:56,404 --> 00:43:57,439
Fire!

580
00:44:01,204 --> 00:44:02,557
Maid Marian!

581
00:44:03,284 --> 00:44:06,401
Do you believe in
love at first sight?

582
00:44:07,484 --> 00:44:10,317
Depends on what you"re looking at.

583
00:44:11,284 --> 00:44:12,239
Well?

584
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,683
To be continued.

585
00:44:26,604 --> 00:44:29,164
Mein liebchen, l"m so glad
l found you.

586
00:44:29,404 --> 00:44:31,076
This party"s getting rough.

587
00:45:10,484 --> 00:45:12,236
When l"m good, l"m good.

588
00:45:12,884 --> 00:45:15,717
Don"t let them get away!
Surround the hall!

589
00:45:15,964 --> 00:45:17,033
Now you"re talking!

590
00:45:41,244 --> 00:45:43,838
l hope it"s worth the noise!

591
00:46:02,004 --> 00:46:03,756
We got him! We got him!

592
00:46:07,884 --> 00:46:09,283
Right rope.

593
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:37,040
Look at this!
We went from royalty to recycling.

594
00:46:38,404 --> 00:46:39,632
Would you get the door?

595
00:46:39,884 --> 00:46:41,112
Yeah, l"ll try.

596
00:46:42,484 --> 00:46:46,636
lt"s been a wonderful party,
and we"d love to stay and all that...

597
00:46:46,884 --> 00:46:50,115
...but l"m afraid we really must dash.
So ta-ta!

598
00:47:09,964 --> 00:47:14,640
l sent word that each village should
send the very best men they have.

599
00:47:14,884 --> 00:47:15,919
These are them.

600
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:23,680
We"re in a lot of trouble.

601
00:47:25,964 --> 00:47:29,639
Good people, who have travelled from
villages near and far...

602
00:47:29,884 --> 00:47:31,237
...lend me your ears.

603
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:38,480
That"s disgusting.

604
00:47:39,564 --> 00:47:40,838
Hear me!

605
00:47:41,164 --> 00:47:43,962
Men like Prince John and Rottingham
must be stopped!

606
00:47:44,204 --> 00:47:48,914
Stopped from taxing us into poverty!
Stopped from taking what is ours!

607
00:47:49,964 --> 00:47:54,162
lf we stand up to them all together
as one, we can win the day!

608
00:47:54,764 --> 00:47:58,154
We shall go on to the end.
We shall not flag or fail.

609
00:47:58,404 --> 00:48:00,474
We shall fight on the seas and oceans.

610
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:04,034
We shall defend our isle,
whatever the cost may be.

611
00:48:04,524 --> 00:48:06,196
We shall never surrender.

612
00:48:07,164 --> 00:48:08,802
Then they shall say of us:

613
00:48:09,044 --> 00:48:13,720
" Never have so many
owed so much to so few."

614
00:48:17,284 --> 00:48:19,798
That was beautiful. What"s going on?

615
00:48:20,044 --> 00:48:21,079
They"re asleep.

616
00:48:23,684 --> 00:48:25,037
Hey, man.

617
00:48:25,564 --> 00:48:26,838
Tough room.

618
00:48:27,684 --> 00:48:29,993
Why don"t you let me give it a try?

619
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,761
Look at yourselves.

620
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,562
Go on, take a look around.

621
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:50,152
People of Sherwood, you been had!

622
00:48:51,004 --> 00:48:52,232
Hoodwinked!

623
00:48:52,724 --> 00:48:54,237
Bamboozled.

624
00:48:54,484 --> 00:48:55,678
Run amuck!

625
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:58,593
We didn"t land on Sherwood Forest.

626
00:48:58,844 --> 00:49:01,358
Sherwood Forest landed on us!

627
00:49:03,444 --> 00:49:04,433
Very good.

628
00:49:04,844 --> 00:49:06,243
They"re all warmed up.

629
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:09,595
Brother Ahchoo is right.

630
00:49:09,924 --> 00:49:11,755
And l say we fight back!

631
00:49:14,164 --> 00:49:15,722
Are you with me?
Yea or nay?

632
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:18,436
Which one means yes?

633
00:49:19,404 --> 00:49:20,200
Yea.

634
00:49:24,604 --> 00:49:28,313
Grab your uniforms and equipment
and prepare for the training sequence.

635
00:49:28,564 --> 00:49:32,113
All right, gentlemen,
grab your feathered caps, shotguns...

636
00:49:32,364 --> 00:49:34,036
...bodkins, boots...

637
00:49:34,284 --> 00:49:35,399
...swords...

638
00:49:35,604 --> 00:49:36,514
...quivers...

639
00:49:36,764 --> 00:49:38,834
...and pantyhose!

640
00:49:42,124 --> 00:49:46,515
Now, men, the object of this exercise
is to hit the target.

641
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:24,639
Now, men...

642
00:50:24,884 --> 00:50:27,557
...keep your eye on Will,
and do exactly as he does.

643
00:50:37,124 --> 00:50:38,239
Very good! Well done!

644
00:50:38,444 --> 00:50:40,719
-All right!
-Right, Will!

645
00:50:40,964 --> 00:50:42,158
That"s not hard.

646
00:50:42,404 --> 00:50:44,918
-We could do that.
-Piece of cake.

647
00:50:47,684 --> 00:50:48,673
Good boy.

648
00:50:49,644 --> 00:50:50,633
Ready, men?

649
00:50:52,724 --> 00:50:54,043
Charge!

650
00:51:02,524 --> 00:51:03,559
Man!

651
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:08,000
Rob, man, maybe we should take
the dummies into battle.

652
00:51:20,284 --> 00:51:21,717
l must speak with you.

653
00:51:24,484 --> 00:51:25,917
What are you smelling?

654
00:51:26,284 --> 00:51:29,560
These aren"t my bubbles.
They"re from the pipes.

655
00:51:30,604 --> 00:51:33,243
Your Majesty, l have terrible news.

656
00:51:33,484 --> 00:51:36,044
Strucky has loxed again.

657
00:51:36,724 --> 00:51:37,634
What?

658
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:40,233
Loxley has struck again.

659
00:51:41,004 --> 00:51:43,643
l"m gonna need some privacy,
so you guys can blow.

660
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:46,474
Not blow.

661
00:51:46,724 --> 00:51:47,839
Blow!

662
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,316
l"m so depressed.

663
00:51:56,564 --> 00:52:00,523
Come with me. l"ll show you something
that will make you very happy.

664
00:52:01,044 --> 00:52:02,762
Fetch the royal robe!

665
00:52:03,004 --> 00:52:04,437
Your Majesty...

666
00:52:05,124 --> 00:52:09,436
...stop me if l"m wrong about this,
but wasn"t your mole...

667
00:52:09,684 --> 00:52:11,117
...on the other side?

668
00:52:12,924 --> 00:52:15,233
l have a mole?

669
00:52:16,004 --> 00:52:17,039
What is it?

670
00:52:17,284 --> 00:52:20,435
lt"s what we"ve named
a Stealth Catapult.

671
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:23,801
We"ve been working on it secretly
for months.

672
00:52:24,164 --> 00:52:27,952
lt can hurl one of these
heavy boulders undetected...

673
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:32,436
...over 1 00 yards, completely
destroying anything it hits.

674
00:52:33,124 --> 00:52:35,274
-How does it work?
-lt"s quite simple.

675
00:52:35,524 --> 00:52:39,073
Take a heavy rock. Put it where
l"m sitting. Then pull that lever.

676
00:52:39,324 --> 00:52:40,757
You mean like this?

677
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:46,640
Oh, dear Lord...

678
00:52:46,884 --> 00:52:50,797
...if you see fit to send me
my one true love--

679
00:52:54,524 --> 00:52:55,673
Thank you!

680
00:52:58,444 --> 00:53:01,038
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, you"re here!

681
00:53:01,284 --> 00:53:02,637
Let me work magic on you.

682
00:53:02,884 --> 00:53:05,398
Kiss me! Kiss me! Touch me!

683
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,679
My back!

684
00:53:07,564 --> 00:53:08,679
l"ve got a headache.

685
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:11,996
Where are you going? Oh, bugger!

686
00:53:14,084 --> 00:53:16,279
l was that close.

687
00:53:17,484 --> 00:53:18,963
l touched it.

688
00:53:26,324 --> 00:53:28,713
l don"t like the way you"re walking.

689
00:53:28,964 --> 00:53:31,683
You"ve been into
the sacramental wine again.

690
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:33,562
You"re fahsnickered!

691
00:53:33,804 --> 00:53:36,193
You drunken mule, you.

692
00:53:40,204 --> 00:53:42,638
Whoa, Morris! Whoa!

693
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:44,953
Halt there, friend.

694
00:53:45,484 --> 00:53:48,920
You"ve just entered the territory
of Robin Hood and his Merry Men.

695
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:54,479
Feygeles?

696
00:53:57,244 --> 00:53:59,121
We"re straight, just merry.

697
00:54:00,804 --> 00:54:04,035
And who might you be with
the long feather in your hat?

698
00:54:04,284 --> 00:54:05,922
l am Robin of Loxley.

699
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:07,358
Robin of Loxley?

700
00:54:07,724 --> 00:54:11,433
l"ve just come from Maid Marian,
the lady whose heart you stole.

701
00:54:11,684 --> 00:54:13,959
You prince of thieves, you.

702
00:54:16,724 --> 00:54:19,761
l knew her parents before
they were taken in the plague...

703
00:54:20,004 --> 00:54:21,960
...Lord and Lady Bagelle.

704
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:24,638
You and Maid Marian were meant
for each other.

705
00:54:24,884 --> 00:54:28,923
What a combination!
Loxley and Bagelle. Can"t miss.

706
00:54:30,244 --> 00:54:31,802
And who are you, sir?

707
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:33,955
l am Rabbi Tuckman...

708
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,399
...purveyor of sacramental wine...

709
00:54:36,644 --> 00:54:38,794
...and mohel extraordinaire.

710
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:40,239
Hello, rabbi.

711
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:42,842
Hello, boys.

712
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:45,644
Mohel? l"ve never heard
of that profession.

713
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:50,197
Mohel, he"s a very important guy.
He makes circumcisions.

714
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,563
What, pray tell, sir,
is a circumcision?

715
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:56,399
lt"s the latest rage.
The ladies love it.

716
00:54:56,644 --> 00:54:57,474
l want one.

717
00:54:57,724 --> 00:54:59,555
-l"ll take two.
-l get one!

718
00:54:59,804 --> 00:55:01,237
l"m game. How"s it done?

719
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:02,758
lt"s a snap.

720
00:55:03,164 --> 00:55:05,075
l take my little machine.

721
00:55:07,004 --> 00:55:09,359
l take your little thing. See?

722
00:55:09,604 --> 00:55:12,960
l put it into this little
hole here...

723
00:55:13,204 --> 00:55:14,353
...and nip the tip.

724
00:55:16,884 --> 00:55:17,919
Who"s first?

725
00:55:18,484 --> 00:55:19,837
l changed me mind.

726
00:55:20,044 --> 00:55:21,523
l forgot, l already got one.

727
00:55:21,764 --> 00:55:22,879
Question--

728
00:55:23,244 --> 00:55:25,314
l gotta work with a much
younger crowd.

729
00:55:25,924 --> 00:55:28,438
Rabbi, you seem to be
on the side of good.

730
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:31,033
Will you join us
and share your wisdom...

731
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:33,844
...your counsel and perhaps...

732
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:35,636
...some of your wine?

733
00:55:36,604 --> 00:55:39,038
Well, wisdom and counsel, that"s easy.

734
00:55:39,284 --> 00:55:40,842
But this is sacramental wine.

735
00:55:41,044 --> 00:55:43,797
lt"s only used to bless things.

736
00:55:47,124 --> 00:55:49,513
Wait a minute!
There"s things here.

737
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:51,875
There"s trees, there"s rocks...

738
00:55:52,124 --> 00:55:54,160
...there"s birds, there"s squirrels.

739
00:55:54,404 --> 00:55:57,874
Come on! We"ll bless them all
until we get fahsnickered!

740
00:55:58,084 --> 00:55:59,437
Join me!

741
00:56:01,284 --> 00:56:03,400
Let"s hear it for the rabbi!

742
00:56:13,724 --> 00:56:15,635
Good evening, Don Giovanni.

743
00:56:20,884 --> 00:56:24,160
lt was very good of you to come
at such short notice.

744
00:56:24,764 --> 00:56:26,561
And all the way from Jersey.

745
00:56:26,804 --> 00:56:28,954
Well, it is quite a drive.

746
00:56:29,204 --> 00:56:33,959
But you do realize that Prince John
commanded this to be a secret meeting?

747
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:36,955
l mean, who are these men?

748
00:56:37,244 --> 00:56:39,200
These are my trusted associates.

749
00:56:39,444 --> 00:56:41,719
On my right, Dirty Ezio.

750
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:45,713
On my left...

751
00:56:46,364 --> 00:56:47,877
...Filthy Luca.

752
00:56:49,444 --> 00:56:50,240
Now...

753
00:56:50,524 --> 00:56:55,279
...we thank you for inviting us
on the day of your daughter"s wedding.

754
00:56:55,964 --> 00:56:59,957
l hope her first child
is a masculine child.

755
00:57:00,164 --> 00:57:02,553
Shut up.
We didn"t have our meeting yet.

756
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:09,119
All right...

757
00:57:09,444 --> 00:57:12,800
...l understand you"ve been bothered
by this fruit, Robin Hood.

758
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:15,753
And you want Robin rubbed out...

759
00:57:15,964 --> 00:57:18,353
...eliminated, maybe even killed.

760
00:57:18,604 --> 00:57:21,164
Yes, you put it succinctly.

761
00:57:21,364 --> 00:57:22,717
Suck what?

762
00:57:23,644 --> 00:57:27,000
-Succinctly. lt means " perfectly."
-Oh, yeah. l knew that.

763
00:57:30,844 --> 00:57:32,402
Excuse me, Don Giovanni...

764
00:57:32,924 --> 00:57:34,994
...your lizard seems limp.

765
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:38,803
At my age, you know, sometimes....

766
00:57:39,044 --> 00:57:40,397
Oh, my lizard!

767
00:57:41,324 --> 00:57:44,282
He"s just sleeping, that"s all.
Charlie. Charlie!

768
00:57:46,644 --> 00:57:48,202
l could have been somebody.

769
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:53,040
l could have been a contender.
You know, Charlie"s got bad breath.

770
00:57:56,564 --> 00:57:59,283
He got excited, you know. Come on.

771
00:58:04,284 --> 00:58:07,833
Normally, l would be so happy
to be of service to you...

772
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:11,156
...but there is something that weighs
heavily on my heart.

773
00:58:11,364 --> 00:58:14,800
ln the years that we"ve been friends,
England and Jersey...

774
00:58:15,044 --> 00:58:18,957
...never once have you invited me
to your home for coffee and cake.

775
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,114
Or ganool.

776
00:58:20,324 --> 00:58:21,552
Something, you know?

777
00:58:21,764 --> 00:58:23,482
-A g-what?
-A ganool.

778
00:58:23,684 --> 00:58:26,915
lt"s a pastry with stuffing.
And it"s got sprinkles on it.

779
00:58:27,524 --> 00:58:28,400
Excuse me.

780
00:58:28,644 --> 00:58:30,953
l don"t understand a word
you"re saying.

781
00:58:31,644 --> 00:58:34,636
l just got back from the dentist...

782
00:58:36,324 --> 00:58:38,474
...and they left in the cotton.

783
00:58:39,404 --> 00:58:42,476
l will take these cotton balls
from you with my hand...

784
00:58:42,724 --> 00:58:44,794
...and put them in my pocket.

785
00:58:49,284 --> 00:58:50,239
Whatever.

786
00:58:51,364 --> 00:58:53,355
Your other associate says little.

787
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:55,202
-He says nothing.
-Why is that?

788
00:58:55,444 --> 00:58:58,675
Because my enemy cut out his tongue.

789
00:58:58,924 --> 00:59:01,074
Good grief! Why?

790
00:59:01,324 --> 00:59:03,519
Because he went like this.

791
00:59:05,644 --> 00:59:07,999
And he didn"t like it,
so he cut out his tongue.

792
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,758
Come over here. Go like this.

793
00:59:13,204 --> 00:59:14,796
He can"t do it!

794
00:59:15,444 --> 00:59:17,355
l love to tease him.

795
00:59:20,084 --> 00:59:22,359
-Tell me, Don Giovanni.
-That"s me. What?

796
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:24,322
What will you do about Robin Hood?

797
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:26,196
Listen, l"ve got an idea.

798
00:59:26,444 --> 00:59:29,993
Tomorrow, you"re going to have
your medieval fun and games.

799
00:59:30,244 --> 00:59:33,122
The most important event will be
the archery contest.

800
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:35,476
Robin won"t be able to resist.

801
00:59:35,724 --> 00:59:36,554
Why"s that?

802
00:59:37,044 --> 00:59:39,319
We"ll make him an offer
he can"t refuse.

803
00:59:39,564 --> 00:59:41,441
l was just gonna say that.

804
00:59:43,364 --> 00:59:44,956
-That"s brilliant!
-Thank you.

805
00:59:45,204 --> 00:59:46,432
-But--
-What?

806
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:50,114
You do realize that Robin is
the finest archer in the land?

807
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:53,762
Don"t you understand?
Luca is good, better, best.

808
00:59:53,964 --> 00:59:56,273
Show him your archery medals.

809
01:00:01,684 --> 01:00:03,993
See? l couldn"t have said it
better myself.

810
01:00:04,244 --> 01:00:08,760
Now, Luca beats Robin
at the archery contest and then...

811
01:00:09,004 --> 01:00:12,076
...Dirty Ezio makes Robin no more.

812
01:00:15,444 --> 01:00:16,763
" No more"?

813
01:00:16,964 --> 01:00:20,843
You want plain English?
Robin is gonna be dead.

814
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:22,756
D-E-D...

815
01:00:23,724 --> 01:00:24,759
...dead.

816
01:00:28,164 --> 01:00:29,279
Dead.

817
01:00:30,964 --> 01:00:32,317
You hear him there?

818
01:00:51,364 --> 01:00:53,594
Broomhilde! Broomhilde, wake up!

819
01:00:53,844 --> 01:00:55,402
There"s a foul plot afoot.

820
01:00:55,644 --> 01:00:58,397
lt"s not mein feet.
l just washed them!

821
01:00:58,924 --> 01:01:03,361
Prince John and the Sheriff have hired
men to kill Robin. We must warn him!

822
01:01:03,564 --> 01:01:06,203
Wait, mein lady!
lf Prince John should see us....

823
01:01:06,444 --> 01:01:08,400
Right. We"ll go out the back.

824
01:01:08,644 --> 01:01:09,793
Right.

825
01:01:11,924 --> 01:01:13,642
Lady!

826
01:01:23,204 --> 01:01:25,672
Broomhilde, l"m going on ahead.
Catch me up!

827
01:01:25,924 --> 01:01:27,357
Come on, lady.

828
01:01:29,764 --> 01:01:31,038
Farfelkugel!

829
01:01:59,804 --> 01:02:00,793
Farfelkugel...

830
01:02:01,044 --> 01:02:05,196
...if l was you,
l would never do that again!

831
01:02:06,404 --> 01:02:07,757
Any questions?

832
01:02:10,484 --> 01:02:11,633
Good.

833
01:02:31,564 --> 01:02:33,361
What are you doing up there?

834
01:02:35,844 --> 01:02:37,118
Guessing.

835
01:02:37,444 --> 01:02:38,763
l...

836
01:02:39,124 --> 01:02:41,433
...guess no one"s coming.

837
01:02:44,524 --> 01:02:46,833
Please come down from there.

838
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:48,759
Twit.

839
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:54,241
l guess there"s a ladder
around here somewhere.

840
01:02:54,964 --> 01:02:56,079
Here we are.

841
01:02:56,524 --> 01:02:57,320
Right.

842
01:03:07,644 --> 01:03:09,202
Oh, shit!

843
01:03:23,124 --> 01:03:25,354
l can see!

844
01:03:33,804 --> 01:03:35,078
l was wrong.

845
01:03:45,884 --> 01:03:47,920
Blimey, these are hard to get on.

846
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,634
Let"s face it, you"ve got to be a man
to wear tights.

847
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:55,359
Will...

848
01:03:55,604 --> 01:03:56,923
...how are me seams?

849
01:03:57,164 --> 01:03:58,153
Perfect.

850
01:03:58,604 --> 01:04:00,401
Every time.

851
01:04:02,644 --> 01:04:03,918
We"re men

852
01:04:04,204 --> 01:04:06,035
We"re men in tights

853
01:04:06,644 --> 01:04:09,477
We roam around the forest
Looking for fights

854
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,283
We"re men

855
01:04:11,524 --> 01:04:13,594
We"re men in tights

856
01:04:13,844 --> 01:04:15,357
We rob from the rich
And give to the poor

857
01:04:15,604 --> 01:04:16,719
That"s right!

858
01:04:17,124 --> 01:04:20,799
We may look like sissies

859
01:04:21,084 --> 01:04:24,281
But watch what you say
Or else we"ll put out your lights

860
01:04:24,804 --> 01:04:25,919
We"re men

861
01:04:26,164 --> 01:04:27,882

We"re men
Manly men!

864
01:04:45,284 --> 01:04:47,115
We"re men in tights
Yes!

865
01:04:47,364 --> 01:04:50,401
We roam around the forest
Looking for fights

866
01:04:50,644 --> 01:04:51,554
We"re men

867
01:04:52,284 --> 01:04:53,797
We"re men in tights

868
01:04:54,884 --> 01:04:55,999
We rob from the rich
And give to the poor

869
01:04:56,244 --> 01:04:57,313
That"s right!

870
01:04:57,884 --> 01:05:01,957
We may look like pansies

871
01:05:02,204 --> 01:05:04,081
But don"t get us wrong
Or else we"ll put out your lights

872
01:05:05,244 --> 01:05:06,882
We"re men

873
01:05:07,124 --> 01:05:09,035

01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:17,397
We"re butch!

877
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:39,560
Here.

878
01:05:40,004 --> 01:05:41,119
Allow me.

879
01:05:42,444 --> 01:05:43,797
Thank you.

880
01:05:52,604 --> 01:05:54,560
You"re so sweet.

881
01:05:54,924 --> 01:05:58,155
ls there anything l can do for you?

882
01:05:59,324 --> 01:06:00,518
You can get off me.

883
01:06:04,604 --> 01:06:05,639
Little John!

884
01:06:06,204 --> 01:06:07,523
l panicked.

885
01:06:13,164 --> 01:06:14,756
What are you doing here?

886
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:19,122
Prince John and Rottingham have hired
murderers to kill you at the fair.

887
01:06:19,524 --> 01:06:21,003
You mustn"t go.

888
01:06:22,564 --> 01:06:24,555
Well, that"s easy. l won"t.

889
01:06:25,204 --> 01:06:27,160
l"m so happy.

890
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:31,556
They were going to lure you there
by having an archery contest.

891
01:06:31,804 --> 01:06:34,238
An archery contest?

892
01:06:34,484 --> 01:06:36,361
Their archer is unbeatable.

893
01:06:36,604 --> 01:06:37,673
Really?

894
01:06:37,924 --> 01:06:40,722
Robin, promise you won"t go.

895
01:06:40,964 --> 01:06:42,795
All right, l promise you won"t go.

896
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:44,238
Thank you.

897
01:06:46,084 --> 01:06:47,756
Hey, wait a minute. You said--

898
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:50,159
-Cool it!
-Chilled.

899
01:06:51,764 --> 01:06:52,913
Come, my dear.

900
01:07:02,204 --> 01:07:05,116
The night is young,
and you"re so beautiful.

901
01:07:05,844 --> 01:07:07,072
B flat.

902
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:10,158
The night is young

903
01:07:10,364 --> 01:07:13,117
And you"re so beautiful

904
01:07:13,364 --> 01:07:15,161
Here among:::

905
01:07:15,404 --> 01:07:16,883
::: the shadows

906
01:07:17,124 --> 01:07:19,115
Beautiful lady

907
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:24,393
Open your heart

908
01:07:27,764 --> 01:07:29,880
The scene is set

909
01:07:30,244 --> 01:07:32,519
The breezes sing of it

910
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:34,117
Can"t you get

911
01:07:34,724 --> 01:07:37,192
Into the swing of it?

912
01:07:37,444 --> 01:07:39,321
Lady

913
01:07:40,884 --> 01:07:42,954
When do we start?

914
01:07:44,724 --> 01:07:48,000
When the lady is kissable

915
01:07:49,044 --> 01:07:51,160
And the evening is cool

916
01:07:53,964 --> 01:07:56,398
Any dream is permissible

917
01:07:58,044 --> 01:08:00,922
In the heart of a fool

918
01:08:03,724 --> 01:08:05,680
The moon is high

919
01:08:05,924 --> 01:08:08,392
And you"re so glamourous

920
01:08:08,724 --> 01:08:12,478
And if I seem over-amorous

921
01:08:12,724 --> 01:08:14,396
Lady

922
01:08:16,124 --> 01:08:18,160
What can I do?

923
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:23,919
The night is young

924
01:08:25,004 --> 01:08:27,757
And I"m in love

925
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:30,074
With:::

926
01:08:31,924 --> 01:08:34,279
:::you!

927
01:08:57,924 --> 01:09:00,996
Oh, my dearest,
l"m ready for that kiss now.

928
01:09:01,244 --> 01:09:03,712
But first, l must warn you...

929
01:09:03,964 --> 01:09:05,875
...it could only be a kiss.

930
01:09:06,124 --> 01:09:08,001
For l am a virgin...

931
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:09,757
...and could never...

932
01:09:10,484 --> 01:09:12,076
...go all the way.

933
01:09:12,764 --> 01:09:15,198
Unless, of course, l were married.

934
01:09:15,964 --> 01:09:18,637
Or if a man pledged
his endless love...

935
01:09:19,404 --> 01:09:20,678
...to me.

936
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:24,712
Or if l knew that he
desperately cared for me.

937
01:09:25,164 --> 01:09:27,359
Or if he were really cute.

938
01:09:29,764 --> 01:09:31,994
But my darling, you"re shivering.

939
01:09:32,244 --> 01:09:35,520
Are you cold? What are you wearing
underneath that cape?

940
01:09:35,724 --> 01:09:37,362
Practically nothing.

941
01:09:42,044 --> 01:09:44,080
Oh, except that.

942
01:09:44,324 --> 01:09:47,794
l forgot to tell you about
my chastity belt. lt"s an Everlast.

943
01:09:48,044 --> 01:09:48,999
l"ll bet.

944
01:09:49,244 --> 01:09:50,472
Oh, darling...

945
01:09:50,724 --> 01:09:52,396
...don"t despair...

946
01:09:52,644 --> 01:09:54,760
...for it is written on a scroll:

947
01:09:54,964 --> 01:09:57,603
"One day, he who is destined
for me...

948
01:09:57,844 --> 01:10:00,233
...shall be endowed
with the magical key...

949
01:10:00,484 --> 01:10:02,361
...that will bring an end to my...

950
01:10:02,604 --> 01:10:04,083
...virginity."

951
01:10:05,124 --> 01:10:06,603
Oh, Marian...

952
01:10:06,884 --> 01:10:08,317
...if only t"were me.

953
01:10:08,564 --> 01:10:10,555
Oh, if it t"were you, t"would be...

954
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:12,522
...t"werrific.

955
01:10:15,484 --> 01:10:17,759
No ding-ding without the wedding ring.

956
01:10:36,564 --> 01:10:38,077
Goodbye, my dearest.

957
01:10:46,204 --> 01:10:47,398
Toodle-loo!

958
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:10,837
-Time-out! Time-out!
-What is wrong?

959
01:11:11,084 --> 01:11:13,644
l should have never worn these shoes.

960
01:11:14,444 --> 01:11:16,594
They just don"t match my purse.

961
01:11:17,804 --> 01:11:19,760
Blinkin, fix your boobs.

962
01:11:20,004 --> 01:11:22,199
You look like a bleeding Picasso.

963
01:11:24,444 --> 01:11:26,002
Goodness gracious!

964
01:11:28,444 --> 01:11:29,479
Peanuts!

965
01:11:29,684 --> 01:11:33,154
Peanut power here!
Poor man"s lunch there!

966
01:11:33,364 --> 01:11:34,319
Shell game here!

967
01:11:45,084 --> 01:11:47,757
The Royal Archery Contest
is about to begin!

968
01:11:48,924 --> 01:11:52,121
Archers, take your places!

969
01:11:58,324 --> 01:11:59,723
Are we...

970
01:12:01,004 --> 01:12:02,437
...prepared?

971
01:12:03,044 --> 01:12:04,193
Sire.

972
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:25,235
Oh, it"s good.

973
01:12:25,724 --> 01:12:27,203
lt"s good.

974
01:12:27,444 --> 01:12:28,763
Archers...

975
01:12:29,004 --> 01:12:30,323
...to the line!

976
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,923
Ready...

977
01:12:41,124 --> 01:12:42,523
...aim...

978
01:12:44,644 --> 01:12:45,759
...wait for it...

979
01:12:47,644 --> 01:12:49,282
...fire!

980
01:12:55,324 --> 01:12:58,361
The two archers that hit
the bull"s-eye can stay!

981
01:12:59,044 --> 01:13:00,557
The rest of you gentlemen...

982
01:13:00,804 --> 01:13:02,157
...can bugger off!

983
01:13:07,164 --> 01:13:08,279
There he is!

984
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:11,559
The old man is Loxley!

985
01:13:15,244 --> 01:13:16,597
Are you sure?

986
01:13:16,844 --> 01:13:18,755
lt looks like Mark Twain.

987
01:13:21,924 --> 01:13:24,597
The old man may go first!

988
01:13:35,804 --> 01:13:37,078
Well done...

989
01:13:37,324 --> 01:13:38,598
...Robin of Loxley!

990
01:13:55,684 --> 01:13:58,403
He"s crazy! We gotta stop him!

991
01:14:00,564 --> 01:14:03,124
Sorry, ladies,
this is the royal entrance.

992
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:05,560
You"ll have to go around
the other way.

993
01:14:07,564 --> 01:14:10,237
Look what you"ve done, you idiot!

994
01:14:10,844 --> 01:14:13,039
Now he"s even more of a hero
to the people.

995
01:14:13,284 --> 01:14:15,354
Luca Pazzo still has a shot.

996
01:14:15,604 --> 01:14:18,801
But he hit the very centre
of the bull"s-eye!

997
01:14:19,044 --> 01:14:20,397
Schmuck!

998
01:14:21,044 --> 01:14:23,353
Wait and watch, sire.

999
01:14:35,844 --> 01:14:39,200
He split Robin"s arrow in twain!

1000
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,755
Things are looking up.

1001
01:14:49,124 --> 01:14:50,557
Nice shot!

1002
01:14:58,204 --> 01:15:00,957
Robin"s in trouble! Shove off!

1003
01:15:02,964 --> 01:15:04,033
l lost.

1004
01:15:04,884 --> 01:15:06,033
l lost?

1005
01:15:06,524 --> 01:15:09,914
l"m not supposed to lose.
Let me see the script.

1006
01:15:12,764 --> 01:15:14,561
Robin, time to fly.

1007
01:15:14,804 --> 01:15:17,159
Go back to Sherwood Forest!

1008
01:15:17,444 --> 01:15:20,083
Oh, good.
They"ve opened the salad bar.

1009
01:15:20,324 --> 01:15:21,200
Wait!

1010
01:15:21,444 --> 01:15:23,162
l get another shot!

1011
01:15:23,404 --> 01:15:24,917
He gets another shot!

1012
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:28,476
Does Robin get another shot?

1013
01:15:35,164 --> 01:15:37,724
Yes, he does. He does.

1014
01:15:41,004 --> 01:15:43,882
Sires and ladies, silence! Listen!

1015
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:45,398
Robin has another shot.

1016
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:50,236
Let"s give him the chop.

1017
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:04,964
Quick! Eliminate him
before he shoots!

1018
01:16:17,564 --> 01:16:18,997
How did you do that?

1019
01:16:19,244 --> 01:16:21,553
l heard that coming a mile away.

1020
01:16:21,804 --> 01:16:25,240
-Very good, Blinkin. Well done.
-Pardon? Who"s talking?

1021
01:16:26,124 --> 01:16:27,193
" Patriot arrow"?

1022
01:17:13,484 --> 01:17:14,280
Arrest him!

1023
01:17:15,924 --> 01:17:17,994
Move it! Move it! Out of the way!

1024
01:17:20,764 --> 01:17:22,402
Loxley is a traitor to the Crown!

1025
01:17:22,684 --> 01:17:25,198
lt"ll be so much fun
to watch you hang!

1026
01:17:27,844 --> 01:17:28,799
Wait!

1027
01:17:30,644 --> 01:17:31,918
What for?

1028
01:17:32,684 --> 01:17:37,553
lf you let Robin live, l"ll do the
most disgusting thing l can think of.

1029
01:17:39,284 --> 01:17:40,876
And what"s that?

1030
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:44,961
l shall marry you.

1031
01:17:45,204 --> 01:17:46,034
What?

1032
01:17:46,444 --> 01:17:49,880
You"ll be mine? You"ll give
yourself to me every night?

1033
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,592
And sometimes right after lunch?

1034
01:17:53,684 --> 01:17:54,560
Yes.

1035
01:17:54,764 --> 01:17:56,561
But only my body.

1036
01:17:56,764 --> 01:18:01,076
You can never have my heart,
my mind, or my soul.

1037
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:04,439
Oh, yes. l respect that.

1038
01:18:08,044 --> 01:18:11,036
Marian, my life"s not worth it!
Just say nay!

1039
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:15,995
Walk this way.

1040
01:18:27,764 --> 01:18:30,756
Send word to one and all
and all and one--

1041
01:18:31,564 --> 01:18:33,361
That"s redundant, isn"t it?

1042
01:18:33,604 --> 01:18:35,276
-What?
-Shut up!

1043
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:39,193
Tell everybody that before the day
is out, we shall have a wedding...

1044
01:18:39,444 --> 01:18:40,718
...or a hanging.

1045
01:18:40,964 --> 01:18:43,159
Either way, we ought to
have a lot of fun.

1046
01:18:49,924 --> 01:18:51,960
We are grossly outnumbered.

1047
01:18:52,164 --> 01:18:53,677
So what can we do?

1048
01:18:54,444 --> 01:18:56,036
We gotta get the villagers.

1049
01:18:56,524 --> 01:18:59,561
-They"re not ready to fight.
-Man, we are choiceless!

1050
01:18:59,804 --> 01:19:02,318
What"s the fastest way
to reach the villagers?

1051
01:19:02,564 --> 01:19:03,963
Why don"t we fox them?

1052
01:19:04,164 --> 01:19:05,119
-Fox them.
-Fox them.

1053
01:19:05,364 --> 01:19:07,002
Fox them!

1054
01:19:18,764 --> 01:19:22,279
Take this message to the village
as fast as you can.

1055
01:19:22,524 --> 01:19:24,913
Now pay attention. Have you got it?

1056
01:19:25,124 --> 01:19:26,113
Good.

1057
01:19:33,964 --> 01:19:37,274
Let"s get out of this ladies"
clothing, get into our tights.

1058
01:19:41,604 --> 01:19:43,913
Come on, man. There you go.

1059
01:19:44,964 --> 01:19:46,158
Are you about...

1060
01:19:46,444 --> 01:19:48,241
...a 1 6, 1 6-1 I2?

1061
01:19:59,964 --> 01:20:01,875
-There.
-lt"s a little tight.

1062
01:20:02,124 --> 01:20:04,319
That"s the idea!

1063
01:20:05,844 --> 01:20:08,404
Would you care for a blindfold?

1064
01:20:09,044 --> 01:20:11,035
How about half a one?

1065
01:20:12,044 --> 01:20:13,238
Get it, sir?

1066
01:20:26,164 --> 01:20:26,960
Sorry.

1067
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:30,592
Good morrow, abbot.

1068
01:20:30,844 --> 01:20:32,516
-Welcome, abbot.
-Good morrow.

1069
01:20:32,764 --> 01:20:34,277
-Hello, abbot.
-Good morrow.

1070
01:20:34,524 --> 01:20:35,798
Hey, Abbott!

1071
01:20:36,444 --> 01:20:38,480
l hate that guy.

1072
01:20:47,244 --> 01:20:49,041
She"s beautiful!

1073
01:20:52,044 --> 01:20:53,796
Present swords!

1074
01:21:20,124 --> 01:21:21,716
What"s going on?

1075
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,997
Just in case you change
your mind, my dear.

1076
01:21:25,804 --> 01:21:29,194
l will conduct the opening prayer
in the new Latin.

1077
01:21:31,644 --> 01:21:33,043
"Oh, ordl-ay...

1078
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:36,720
...iveusg-ay oury-ay essingsbl-ay.

1079
01:21:37,644 --> 01:21:40,158
Amen-ay."

1080
01:21:47,644 --> 01:21:49,794
We are gathered here today...

1081
01:21:50,044 --> 01:21:54,003
...to witness the marriage
of Mervyn, the Sheriff of--

1082
01:21:58,164 --> 01:21:58,960
Mervyn?

1083
01:22:00,444 --> 01:22:01,763
Your name is Mervyn?

1084
01:22:06,164 --> 01:22:07,153
Shut up! Shut up!

1085
01:22:07,804 --> 01:22:09,203
Continue with the service.

1086
01:22:23,444 --> 01:22:24,718
Do you...

1087
01:22:25,364 --> 01:22:27,355
...Sheriff of Rottingham...

1088
01:22:27,564 --> 01:22:30,397
...take Maid Marian
to be your lawful wedded wife?

1089
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:33,283
To love and to hold
in sickness and in health...

1090
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:36,914
-...till death do you part?
-Yes, l do. Get on with it!

1091
01:22:37,204 --> 01:22:40,594
Marian, do you vow to do
all the stuff l just said to him?

1092
01:22:41,804 --> 01:22:43,078
Say, " l do" ...

1093
01:22:43,324 --> 01:22:44,996
...or Robin dies.

1094
01:22:50,444 --> 01:22:51,797
l....

1095
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:54,277
l...

1096
01:22:55,604 --> 01:22:56,559
...do...

1097
01:22:57,324 --> 01:22:58,677
...not!

1098
01:23:03,404 --> 01:23:05,838
-Who"s the man? Who"s the man?
-Go!

1099
01:23:06,044 --> 01:23:07,796
Arrest them! Seize them!
Stop them!

1100
01:23:08,044 --> 01:23:10,274
Hurt them! Hurt them!

1101
01:23:10,524 --> 01:23:12,640
Look! The villagers are coming!

1102
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:24,955
l believe this belongs to you, sir.

1103
01:23:25,204 --> 01:23:26,557
You know what they say...

1104
01:23:26,764 --> 01:23:29,153
..." No noose is good noose."

1105
01:23:37,844 --> 01:23:38,993
Nice shooting.

1106
01:23:39,244 --> 01:23:42,361
To tell you the truth,
l was aiming for the hangman.

1107
01:23:45,124 --> 01:23:46,273
Fellas...

1108
01:23:46,524 --> 01:23:47,877
...we got company.

1109
01:23:48,124 --> 01:23:51,275
On the count of jump--!
Wait for it....

1110
01:23:51,524 --> 01:23:53,196
Charge!

1111
01:23:53,564 --> 01:23:54,440
Jump!

1112
01:24:15,604 --> 01:24:18,721
l shall have you, married or no!

1113
01:24:46,204 --> 01:24:48,798
The Sheriff,
he got your woman, man!

1114
01:24:50,804 --> 01:24:52,681
He"s taking her to the tower!

1115
01:24:52,884 --> 01:24:54,954
He"s gonna deflower her in the tower!

1116
01:24:57,124 --> 01:25:00,673
l"m sorry we don"t have enough time
for romance, my dear.

1117
01:25:04,124 --> 01:25:06,638
Consider this foreplay!

1118
01:25:10,484 --> 01:25:12,236
A chastity belt?

1119
01:25:13,164 --> 01:25:15,997
That"s going to chafe my willy.

1120
01:25:16,244 --> 01:25:17,836
l"ll be back.

1121
01:25:18,084 --> 01:25:20,644
l hope she"s still wearing
her iron underwear.

1122
01:25:23,444 --> 01:25:25,321
No matter what you do...

1123
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:27,401
...l will never submit.

1124
01:25:40,204 --> 01:25:41,637
Prepare for the fight scene.

1125
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:46,112
Forgive the interruption, my darling.

1126
01:25:46,844 --> 01:25:48,914
l"ll dispatch your love...

1127
01:25:49,324 --> 01:25:50,916
...and then come back...

1128
01:25:51,164 --> 01:25:52,836
...and finish the job.

1129
01:25:56,964 --> 01:25:58,920
-En garde!
-Thanks for the warning.

1130
01:26:03,844 --> 01:26:04,993
Shocking!

1131
01:26:12,604 --> 01:26:13,673
Parry, parry.

1132
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:15,403
Thrust, thrust.

1133
01:26:15,644 --> 01:26:16,838
Good!

1134
01:26:55,604 --> 01:26:56,923
Oh, sorry.

1135
01:27:38,244 --> 01:27:41,156
lt is the key to the greatest
treasure in all the land!

1136
01:27:42,044 --> 01:27:46,276
This means you"ve always been my one
true love because it"s the right size!

1137
01:27:47,044 --> 01:27:50,195
lt"s not the size that counts!
lt"s how you use it!

1138
01:28:01,844 --> 01:28:03,357
Thank you, my friend.

1139
01:28:18,444 --> 01:28:19,479
Oh, it"s...

1140
01:28:19,724 --> 01:28:20,759
...not so bad.

1141
01:28:23,844 --> 01:28:25,482
l was wrong.

1142
01:28:31,164 --> 01:28:34,634
Oh, my dear, beloved
Sheriff of Rottingham!

1143
01:28:34,884 --> 01:28:36,363
You"ve been run through!

1144
01:28:36,764 --> 01:28:38,675
How do you feel?

1145
01:28:39,364 --> 01:28:42,322
l"m dying, you fool!

1146
01:28:42,644 --> 01:28:44,396
-You don"t have to die!
-l don"t?

1147
01:28:46,124 --> 01:28:48,479
l"ve got this magic pill...

1148
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:51,363
...that could save your life.

1149
01:28:52,364 --> 01:28:54,480
And l"ll give it to you...

1150
01:28:54,724 --> 01:28:56,794
...if you promise to marry me...

1151
01:28:57,044 --> 01:28:59,478
...and be mine forever!

1152
01:29:03,164 --> 01:29:05,314
Oh, all right!

1153
01:29:14,124 --> 01:29:15,159
How do you feel now?

1154
01:29:15,404 --> 01:29:16,757
Good, good.

1155
01:29:17,004 --> 01:29:18,278
Surprisingly good.

1156
01:29:18,524 --> 01:29:20,435
And yet, somehow...

1157
01:29:21,444 --> 01:29:24,083
...incredibly depressed.

1158
01:29:36,044 --> 01:29:38,399
l always wanted to marry a cop.

1159
01:29:38,644 --> 01:29:40,600
Wait! Wait!

1160
01:29:40,844 --> 01:29:43,438
l"ve changed my mind!

1161
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:49,597
l love you, Robin of Loxley.

1162
01:29:49,844 --> 01:29:52,438
And l you, Marian of Bagelle.

1163
01:30:05,764 --> 01:30:07,163
Oh, my darling...

1164
01:30:07,644 --> 01:30:09,362
...at last.

1165
01:30:24,524 --> 01:30:27,118
Wait, wait!
You"re not married yet!

1166
01:30:27,804 --> 01:30:30,796
Before you do it,
you must go through it!

1167
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:33,556
Or else l blew it.

1168
01:30:41,644 --> 01:30:42,440
Hey, rabbi!

1169
01:30:48,564 --> 01:30:49,792
Who calls?

1170
01:30:50,324 --> 01:30:52,838
lt is l, Robin.
We wish to get married...

1171
01:30:53,084 --> 01:30:54,278
...in a hurry.

1172
01:30:54,644 --> 01:30:56,760
" Married in a hurry"?
That"s wonderful!

1173
01:30:57,004 --> 01:30:59,996
Wait, l"m on my last customer.
l"ll be right out.

1174
01:31:03,644 --> 01:31:06,112
Put a little ice on it.
lt"ll be fine.

1175
01:31:09,204 --> 01:31:12,082
Married in a hurry!
Please invite me to the bris.

1176
01:31:12,324 --> 01:31:13,996
Now, are you ready?

1177
01:31:14,244 --> 01:31:15,199
Robin, do you?

1178
01:31:15,444 --> 01:31:16,399
l do.

1179
01:31:16,764 --> 01:31:18,561
-Marian, do you?
-l do.

1180
01:31:18,804 --> 01:31:21,398
l now pronounce you man and--

1181
01:31:21,604 --> 01:31:22,480
l object!

1182
01:31:23,884 --> 01:31:24,680
Who asked?

1183
01:31:25,324 --> 01:31:28,236
lt"s King Richard,
back from the Crusades!

1184
01:31:29,644 --> 01:31:31,919
Boy, now l"m in trouble.

1185
01:31:36,244 --> 01:31:38,804
You are no longer worthy to wear...

1186
01:31:39,044 --> 01:31:41,604
...this sacred symbol of authority.

1187
01:31:42,804 --> 01:31:45,193
Oh, please have mercy on me, brother.

1188
01:31:45,524 --> 01:31:46,593
lt wasn"t my fault.

1189
01:31:46,844 --> 01:31:48,960
l got bad advice from Rottingham.

1190
01:31:49,244 --> 01:31:50,677
Bullshit! Bullshit!

1191
01:31:51,484 --> 01:31:54,954
Brother, you have surrounded
your given name...

1192
01:31:55,164 --> 01:31:57,041
...with a foul stench!

1193
01:31:58,284 --> 01:31:59,763
From this day forth...

1194
01:32:00,004 --> 01:32:04,202
...all the toilets in this kingdom
shall be known as...

1195
01:32:04,884 --> 01:32:06,033
..."Johns."

1196
01:32:08,964 --> 01:32:09,999
Take him away!

1197
01:32:10,244 --> 01:32:11,393
Wait! Wait!

1198
01:32:12,044 --> 01:32:14,114
Put him in the Tower of London!

1199
01:32:15,044 --> 01:32:17,512
Make him part of the tour.

1200
01:32:23,924 --> 01:32:28,236
The news of your great deeds
has reached me even in Jerusalem.

1201
01:32:28,484 --> 01:32:32,955
England owes you and your men a great
debt of gratitude. Henceforth...

1202
01:32:33,164 --> 01:32:35,598
...your rights and lands
shall be returned...

1203
01:32:35,844 --> 01:32:39,723
...and you shall rule all Sherwood
from this day forth.

1204
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:44,954
Kneel, Robin of Loxley.

1205
01:32:48,844 --> 01:32:50,197
And arise...

1206
01:32:50,444 --> 01:32:53,356
...Sir Robin of Loxley.

1207
01:32:58,244 --> 01:32:59,518
Thank you, sir.

1208
01:32:59,804 --> 01:33:00,998
Excuse me, king.

1209
01:33:01,244 --> 01:33:05,442
Why, if you like this guy so much, do
you object to his marriage to Marian?

1210
01:33:05,684 --> 01:33:08,596
l have no objections,
but l haven"t yet kissed the bride.

1211
01:33:08,844 --> 01:33:11,802
lt is a custom and my royal right.

1212
01:33:12,044 --> 01:33:13,238
Hold this, Father.

1213
01:33:13,764 --> 01:33:15,356
-Rabbi.
-Whatever.

1214
01:33:25,004 --> 01:33:26,915
lt"s good to be the king.

1215
01:33:31,164 --> 01:33:32,802
Now you may marry them.

1216
01:33:33,044 --> 01:33:34,716
Thank you. Here"s your knife.

1217
01:33:34,964 --> 01:33:36,443
-Sword.
-Whatever.

1218
01:33:37,844 --> 01:33:40,961
Okay, where did we leave off?
Oh, that"s right.

1219
01:33:41,204 --> 01:33:43,559
We"re up to the best part.
Do you, Marian?

1220
01:33:44,004 --> 01:33:44,880
l do.

1221
01:33:45,124 --> 01:33:47,319
-Do you, Robin?
-l do.

1222
01:33:47,924 --> 01:33:51,200
l now pronounce you man and...

1223
01:33:54,604 --> 01:33:55,673
...wife!

1224
01:34:02,964 --> 01:34:05,524
We"re going to have to
remodel the castle...

1225
01:34:05,764 --> 01:34:08,517
...to make room for all the babies.

1226
01:34:14,044 --> 01:34:16,877
For my first order of business,
l wish to appoint...

1227
01:34:17,124 --> 01:34:19,001
...a new sheriff of Rottingham.

1228
01:34:19,244 --> 01:34:20,279
My friend...

1229
01:34:20,924 --> 01:34:22,118
...Ahchoo.

1230
01:34:22,324 --> 01:34:23,518
All right!

1231
01:34:24,244 --> 01:34:26,599
A black sheriff?

1232
01:34:27,124 --> 01:34:28,443
He"s black?

1233
01:34:29,284 --> 01:34:30,763
And why not?

1234
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:33,438
lt worked in Blazing Saddles:

1235
01:34:35,484 --> 01:34:36,519
That"s good.

1236
01:34:50,564 --> 01:34:52,475
So that"s the story
And it worked out good

1237
01:34:52,724 --> 01:34:54,874
Richard"s on his throne
And Robin"s back in the "hood

1238
01:34:55,124 --> 01:34:59,356
So let"s bid our friends a fine adieu
And hope we meet again in Robin Hood 2

1239
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:14,273
Rise...

1240
01:35:14,524 --> 01:35:17,482
...Sir Robin of Loxley.

1241
01:35:23,764 --> 01:35:25,197
Hey, Abbott!

1242
01:35:26,364 --> 01:35:27,956
l hate that guy!

1243
01:35:29,324 --> 01:35:32,839
Let"s see now.
What are you, 1 6, 1 6-1 I2?

1244
01:35:38,044 --> 01:35:39,682
Feygeles?

1245
01:35:44,244 --> 01:35:45,393
Welcome home...

1246
01:35:45,644 --> 01:35:47,362
...Mrs. of Loxley.

1247
01:35:47,604 --> 01:35:49,162
Mrs. of Loxley.

1248
01:35:49,404 --> 01:35:51,520
Oh, l"m so happy!

1249
01:35:57,804 --> 01:35:59,078
Oh, my dearest...

1250
01:35:59,444 --> 01:36:01,275
...shall l turn the key?

1251
01:36:01,524 --> 01:36:03,401
Oh, yes, darling!

1252
01:36:03,644 --> 01:36:04,554
But please...

1253
01:36:06,724 --> 01:36:08,157
...be gentle.

1254
01:36:14,524 --> 01:36:16,003
Darling?

1255
01:36:16,244 --> 01:36:17,154
What?

1256
01:36:17,364 --> 01:36:20,037
-You"re not going to believe this:
-What?

1257
01:36:20,244 --> 01:36:22,633
-It won"t open:
-What?

1258
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:25,760
