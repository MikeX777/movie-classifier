00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:19,251
BLEAK STREET

2
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,676
Damn, I didn't see you.

3
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,806
I didn't see you at all.

4
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,243
I swear you had
the mask on already...

5
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,320
...you are so fussy
and paranoid, damn it.

6
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,545
Tell Death to pay up.

7
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,685
I asked him yesterday,
but he played dumb.

8
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,693
Don't wake her or
she'll keep me up.

9
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:35,921
Do you have a fight today?

10
00:02:35,922 --> 00:02:38,300
You bet. It's Wednesday.

11
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,657
Careful!

12
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:47,326
You know your mask
frightens her.

13
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,294
She'd better get used
to it while she's little.

14
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:50,797
How is she to know it's a mask?

15
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,334
Hey, when you get home tonight...

16
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,576
...wake me and I'll tell you...

17
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,007
They made a fuss at the daycare...

18
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,386
...because I still breast feed her.
Can you believe it?

19
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,354
Those dirty minds!

20
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,518
You can tell me tonight.
I'm leaving now.

21
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:02,307
You fight tonight?

22
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,042
Come on, boys, kneel over here.

23
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,643
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit...

24
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,657
...may Divine Providence give you
a home, clothes, health and food...

25
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:17,626
...may the Holy Mother of Heaven
give you blessed victory.

26
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,533
Go on ahead.

27
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,046
I'll send your father
in a while.

28
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,504
We were up really
late last night.

29
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,075
Drunk out of your gourds.

30
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,543
Respect your parents, child...

31
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,888
...or the Almighty
will burn your mouth.

32
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,382
Yeah, ma, but you
should quit boozing.

33
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,387
You know dad is supposed
to be our manager and all.

34
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,420
Your mouth will dry up
if you talk like that...

35
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,923
...about the father
God gave you!

36
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,024
Especially today...

37
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,663
...when you have a fight...

38
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,098
lest you summon bad luck.

39
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,813
Did you bring my allowance?

40
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,160
I tell you, no sense asking
about the uniform gloves...

41
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,038
...they went on
a bender last night.

42
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,739
Wear the other ones,
the leather ones. From the gym.

43
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,575
If I do, Death will kill me.
You know how finicky he is.

44
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,103
You're such a wuss.

45
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,516
I may be a reflection
of AK-47...

46
00:07:20,573 --> 00:07:22,073
...but we treat each
other with respect.

47
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,850
He's not going to mess
with me over my costume.

48
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,916
That's not my lot. I wasn't
born to be bossed around.

49
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,797
Stop your bitching. You
and I were born to be equal.

50
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,455
Identical twins.

51
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,156
But if you keep letting
people bully you...

52
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:40,194
...you must like it.
Be like me.

53
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,528
Whatever, but in the end,
Death is right.

54
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:45,668
Being a reflection is
serious business.

55
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:49,872
No laughing matter.
The uniform is the uniform.

56
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:14,833
Adela...

57
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:18,163
...did you forget?

58
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,907
No way, godmother.
I was looking for you.

59
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:24,102
No, Adela.

60
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,771
You can't try to put one
over on MÃ©rgara...

61
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:30,811
...with all my boys looking
out for me and my interests.

62
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,930
Can I have my corner
tonight, the usual one?

63
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,260
Oh, Adela, dear...

64
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:48,696
...don't you know I want
it for a young girl?

65
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,803
Doesn't experience count?

66
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,808
Truth be told, no.

67
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,554
Weren't you supposed
to give me the money?

68
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:45,756
In awhile, child.
We were up late last night.

69
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,354
You knew I had to pay
for the phone early today.

70
00:09:49,355 --> 00:09:51,596
Why did you stay out?

71
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,163
You really are...

72
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:58,571
She whored all night so you
could pay for the phone...

73
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,107
...you dumb shit!

74
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,712
Ma

75
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:06,009
tell that man not
to talk to me.

76
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,984
He's pissed you're
buying me a phone.

77
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,583
For your information,
I am the daughter.

78
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,250
And if she owes
anyone, it's me...

79
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,891
...not you, you
fat ass freeloader!

80
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,227
I'm coming.

81
00:10:29,228 --> 00:10:31,997
I just told you I was up late.

82
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,773
That's what we agreed on.

83
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,733
Don't rile him.

84
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,771
Can't you see he's my husband?

85
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,374
What about me? Am I just
supposed to take it?

86
00:11:13,906 --> 00:11:16,750
That's what you've told
me since I was little:

87
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,443
Suck it up, he's my husband.

88
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,015
This one or the others.

89
00:11:21,147 --> 00:11:23,381
And this one repays you
for supporting him by...

90
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,949
...screwing your girlfriends.

91
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,021
And you just suck it up.

92
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,355
He doesn't even give us money.

93
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,191
Money isn't everything.

94
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:34,069
You'll understand one day.

95
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:40,209
So? ls there proof of
purchase for the phone?

96
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,107
I don't want you
getting into trouble.

97
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:45,804
Rig ht, proof of purchase.

98
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,216
Sure!

99
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,253
Don't you know where
he got them from?

100
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,156
You love to play
dumb, don't you?

101
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,988
And can I pay it in
easy installments?

102
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:29,819
You shit little midget!

103
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,021
Are you blind?

104
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,501
Take that, asshole!

105
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:45,908
There it is!

106
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,208
Yes, indeed!

107
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,514
What's up, man?

108
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:35,526
You wanna fight me?

109
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:43,833
Take that!

110
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,960
Feel it, asshole!

111
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,237
No, fuck!

112
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,938
What's up, shorty?

113
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:02,442
Is your father sleeping
it off again today?

114
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:04,845
He's coming.

115
00:14:05,044 --> 00:14:06,318
We saw him today.

116
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,112
Your old man is a drunk.

117
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:10,286
That's why you are diminished.

118
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,330
Diminished?

119
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:17,059
Do you want to have
a go with me?

120
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:18,323
Don't fall for it.

121
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,895
Death just wants
to get you going.

122
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,372
The midgets are pissed.

123
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,966
He got to me.

124
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,869
Stop bugging Little Death.

125
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,003
Mascots are a part of one.

126
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,950
Aren't they, Little AK?

127
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,953
You bet. AK-47 and me
get along great.

128
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,010
You should, too.

129
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,218
Otherwise you get
your <i>asses</i> kicked.

130
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,549
We have never ever
had our asses kicked.

131
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,188
No matter how pissed we get.

132
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:51,199
Breathe. He just wants
to get your goat.

133
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,600
Well, he did.

134
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,994
We work as their mascots.

135
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,305
We have to be righteous mascots.

136
00:15:00,532 --> 00:15:02,603
One of these days, I'm leaving.

137
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:06,307
Leaving? No fucking way!

138
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:08,172
You and me together.

139
00:15:08,173 --> 00:15:10,508
And when we're not together,
what will happen?

140
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,489
When they pit us
against each other?

141
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:14,579
Don't even think it.

142
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,424
If some entrepreneur finds
out, he'll love the idea.

143
00:15:17,549 --> 00:15:19,918
Brother against brother.

144
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,991
A fig ht between twins,
to the death.

145
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,431
The perverts!

146
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,207
You are a dumb shit.

147
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:50,274
Pretending to be asleep.

148
00:16:50,275 --> 00:16:52,414
It takes more than that
to fool me.

149
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,260
Get smart with me and one
of these nights...

150
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:02,390
...I will douse you with
gasoline to warm my dawn.

151
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,197
I can smell deceit.

152
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,643
I can smell it a mile off.

153
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,666
It's over.

154
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,648
No sweat.

155
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:23,345
Stop snorting, you'll
keep me awake.

156
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:12,457
Jeza!

157
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,462
Jezabel!

158
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,758
I forgot to give you your
allowance. I'm leaving.

159
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,170
Hurry LIP...

160
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,878
Sit up sol can put
your shoes on.

161
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:09,179
Cooperate!

162
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,656
Where do you expect me to
get food money on my own?

163
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,779
You taught me...

164
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,853
...that only old women
are good for begging.

165
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,693
Come on, cooperate.

166
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:34,311
You may be old and scrawny,
but you sure are heavy.

167
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:38,472
The kids are coming
to help us out.

168
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,427
Are you taking her out
to beg again?

169
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,322
Can't you see the state she's in?

170
00:20:58,323 --> 00:20:59,890
Have you no mercy?

171
00:20:59,891 --> 00:21:01,302
This is senior abuse.

172
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,294
I'm going to report you,
wait and see.

173
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,241
Yeah? Who are you going
to report me to?

174
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,864
Human Rights.

175
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,936
They protect senior citizens...

176
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,810
...and I'll tell them there
are minors involved, too.

177
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,572
They come because they want to.

178
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,374
And because I give them money.

179
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,547
Is there no freedom?

180
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:21,887
That's child labor, its
a crime under the penal code.

181
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,592
And you have the old woman
trussed up like a pig.

182
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:28,961
That's her safety belt
so she won't fall.

183
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,763
I'll tell them you have her
bare assed, without diapers.

184
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,304
Human Rights and the
District Attorney's Office.

185
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:37,928
You buy her diapers!

186
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,664
Do you know what they cost?

187
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:41,465
- Where would I get the money?
- Work.

188
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,600
I work.

189
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,774
Work in something that
still delivers.

190
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:45,803
I deliver...

191
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,707
And for your information, she is
bare assed for ventilation.

192
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,688
I don't want her to chafe!

193
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:53,954
Go on!

194
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,860
Is she really going to report
you to Human Rights?

195
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:10,928
For what?

196
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,374
Tell me, what for?

197
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,700
I feed her, I dress her,
I cuddle her.

198
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:16,873
I take care...

199
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,538
...she has to help me out.

200
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,672
She doesn't even understand.

201
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:23,407
She understands I do it
for both of us.

202
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,853
Right, old woman?

203
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,716
She doesn't turn her nose
up at begging.

204
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,087
She's the one who
taught me the trade.

205
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,551
To paint sores.

206
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,386
To whimper.

207
00:22:35,387 --> 00:22:36,695
All of the tricks.

208
00:22:38,056 --> 00:22:42,027
Adjust her seat belt. We don't
want her falling on the street.

209
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,908
Place her coin can.

210
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,835
What if Human Rights
finds out about us...

211
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,543
...that you're
perverting us?

212
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,915
You tell them I am
teaching you a trade.

213
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,490
Thanks.

214
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,436
My clothes!

215
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,843
In my clothes! God damn!

216
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,010
In my clothing, Maximino?

217
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,615
No way, man!

218
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:44,682
Paid merchandise
all pawed over.

219
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:46,993
You're screwed and that's it.

220
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,223
You're crazy, hitting him.
Crazy!

221
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,898
It's not me, everyone knows.

222
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,561
Crazy nut case.
You should be tied up.

223
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:01,533
And I am Max, not Maximino,
once and for all!

224
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:06,004
My clothing, asshole!
In my clothing, you bastard!

225
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,272
The clothes that put
food on our table.

226
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:11,914
Now it turns out I'm good at
opening my legs like plumbing...

227
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,856
...so you can live easy,
and just look!

228
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,780
My best skirt, you bastard!

229
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,282
It doesn't even fit you.

230
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,923
You ruined it!

231
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,898
What? Did you pay admission?

232
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:33,898
My clothes, you inconsiderate fuck!

233
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:36,004
But you'll see!

234
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,254
Didn't I tell you?

235
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,020
Out of your gourd!

236
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:58,092
Ready for a straight jacket.

237
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:01,160
Those are my magician
clothes, you bitch!

238
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,027
Weren't mine work clothes?

239
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:05,565
The ones I earn the money
for your sweets with?

240
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,234
With this skirt...

241
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:10,904
...you faggot pussy!

242
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:15,007
You think you own me
for three fucking pesos?

243
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,907
Think again.

244
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,582
I'm leaving right now.

245
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:21,915
Do you know why
I'm running away?

246
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:25,290
To forget the pestilent cunt...

247
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:28,794
...you force me to shag.

248
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,059
We don't say shag
in this country.

249
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:32,190
I do.

250
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:37,265
Shag, shag, shag,
just so you know!

251
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,571
And we're done!

252
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:42,868
Let some other poor bastard
put up with your scenes.

253
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,903
Not with my clothes!
Not with my clothes!

254
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,212
Let go of me!

255
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,283
Let go of me!

256
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,291
Everyone said so.

257
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,836
Your husband is really queer.

258
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,773
And me breaking my ass.

259
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,905
Like a dumb fuck.

260
00:27:16,234 --> 00:27:18,976
I put up with a bunch
of broads...

261
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,639
but now you bring me a faggot.

262
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
No.

263
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,915
Not that.

264
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,015
That's a no go.

265
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,622
Was it really me?

266
00:27:33,351 --> 00:27:37,731
I mean, I'm not
a complete fright.

267
00:27:38,423 --> 00:27:40,924
Not like I used to be...

268
00:27:40,925 --> 00:27:45,032
...but I give the
clients full service.

269
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:48,298
They leave happy, satisfied.

270
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:51,678
Anyone can satisfy them.

271
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,406
What really crossed
the line, Maximino...

272
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:57,910
...is you wearing
my work clothes.

273
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:01,014
Once and for all, don't
call me Maximino...

274
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,124
...I'm Max.

275
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:06,254
And as for your clothes...

276
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,219
...I'll get you some later.

277
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,699
With what?

278
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,391
I'm going to give you
an allowance so you...

279
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:16,269
...can buy me clothes?

280
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:24,134
Your magician's rags, take
them to the cleaner or tailor.

281
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:26,115
I'll pay for it.

282
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,048
For how long, Max?

283
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:36,157
Why do you want to know?

284
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:39,316
You really fucked up, Max...

285
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,695
...I mean, in my clothes.

286
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:40,310
Truth is, this makes more
than a long night...

287
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,917
...on a street with no clients.

288
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:45,789
And with that piss stench
of yours they don't...

289
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:50,833
...want to get close enough
to see if we robbed them.

290
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,131
I'm going to get food
for you and for me.

291
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,857
Remember...

292
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,458
Be still.

293
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:31,099
Don't try to get smart with me.

294
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,945
A person needs a helper and the
old woman doesn't cut it.

295
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,135
A helper?

296
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,207
My old woman, you know?

297
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:17,541
She was really good when
we started working together.

298
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,580
Professional, serious.

299
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:23,146
Now she's just a bag of bones.

300
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,218
And as for whoring,
well, that's out.

301
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,957
Don't tell me you can still
make it on the streets?

302
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:30,458
Sorry.

303
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,318
The golden age has
passed us all by.

304
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,609
But I have some tricks.

305
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,212
I look at the young
floozies and I tell myself:

306
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,489
The years will fall
on you, too.

307
00:31:58,116 --> 00:31:59,925
I won't tell you
what I'm into...

308
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,585
Today I went out to work.

309
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,587
You know I do some begging...

310
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,329
now that I'm low on clients...

311
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,392
...and a friggin neighbor
says to me:

312
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:12,102
I'm going to tell Human Rights
and I don't know what all.

313
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,299
The pious ones give themselves
airs and give us sermons.

314
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,302
They are the worst!

315
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,603
Just tell me and
I'll beat her up...

316
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,278
...teach her to
mind her own business.

317
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,321
That's my Dora!

318
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,312
Come, let's get a drink...

319
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:32,227
...and hate everything
and everyone.

320
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,575
Oh, little Dora,
I have missed you.

321
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:52,478
Years pass, but
affection runs deep.

322
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,195
What do you say, woman?

323
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,608
Shall we warm our lungs?

324
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,400
I pass.

325
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,348
You know I'm a dainty young lady.

326
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:29,006
Well, as for booze,
I don't have any.

327
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,749
Only rubbing alcohol.

328
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:37,289
How did we meet?

329
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:45,565
You're lucky you have
no one to look after.

330
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,367
What about this
damn beggar woman?

331
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,661
I know what it is.

332
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:52,697
What?

333
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:55,107
Why we care for each other.

334
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,700
Because of the drops.

335
00:33:56,701 --> 00:34:00,513
All the times we worked
together as droppers.

336
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,149
Yeah.

337
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:07,086
Giving the customers
drops and taking their dough.

338
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:12,224
But we were really stupid.

339
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,730
We worked for a hag who
took the fruits of our labor.

340
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:23,060
We care about each other...

341
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:26,702
...because of the holy sweat
of labor fulfilled.

342
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:31,073
Hey, are you really doing
poorly at the trade?

343
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,803
I keep on going.

344
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,751
It's the trade that has left me.

345
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,448
Don't tempt the devil.

346
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:42,112
Thank God this trade
is like mange...

347
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,117
...it never ever leaves you.

348
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:50,265
Not even after I had this done.

349
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:54,827
Like the young whores have.

350
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:58,569
It didn't do any good.

351
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,630
Damn MÃ©rgara said to me:

352
00:35:00,631 --> 00:35:02,599
You're rusted.

353
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,206
No matter what you put on.

354
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,571
MÃ©rgara has no compassion.

355
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:09,552
With her being a dyke and all...

356
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,484
...she couldn't hack the trade
and ended up pimping.

357
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:15,786
Always surrounded by
a brood of queers.

358
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,754
Anyone would feel a big shit
under those circumstances.

359
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:22,426
Why do you have it in
for faggots today?

360
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,287
Because of what I told you.

361
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,758
And because they are
never our clients.

362
00:35:28,659 --> 00:35:30,594
I have some pending business...

363
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,769
.otherwise I would
stay and gossip.

364
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,436
Remember the time we put
the fat guy to sleep...

365
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,178
...and your hand got stuck?

366
00:35:42,206 --> 00:35:47,781
And when he woke up,
he beat the shit out of us.

367
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:49,813
See?

368
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,418
It's broken.

369
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,823
Now, it's nothing but worries.

370
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,465
Distress.

371
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,323
And that bastard Max
in my clothes.

372
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,396
In your clothes, in your
clothes, in your clothes...

373
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,395
I know I already told you...

374
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,398
...but it just isn't fair!

375
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,234
The life you lead.

376
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,408
Without any ties.

377
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,817
I'll see you, I'm late.

378
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:33,826
Dora is wrong.

379
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,764
I take care of you.

380
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:58,352
And people say I have
no one to care for.

381
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,801
Hey.

382
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,673
The manager heard about
the scene this morning.

383
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,742
And what's it to you?

384
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:17,506
Besides the brouhaha this
morning, I could tell him...

385
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:22,645
...about your daughter sneaking
a boy up by the water tanks.

386
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,517
Just so you'll know
and take precautions.

387
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,381
Then don't act all surprised
when she gets knocked up.

388
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:34,990
My husband may be a faggot, my
daughter may be a slut and all...

389
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,487
...but I'm the tenant!

390
00:37:37,488 --> 00:37:39,263
You have to put up with me!

391
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:49,343
Everyone is sucking my blood.

392
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:50,938
Everyone!

393
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,719
You'd better go back.
I told you...

394
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,523
You told me I could on
Wednesdays which are slow.

395
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:10,457
Can I have my corner?

396
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,830
It's been mine forever.

397
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,970
Used to be, not anymore.

398
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,826
How can that be?

399
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,495
You're looking at it.

400
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:19,941
And if you can't see it,
you will.

401
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:21,876
What can I do?

402
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,311
Crochet.

403
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,423
Come on little ones,
you've found your momma!

404
00:38:53,531 --> 00:38:55,943
The party is set for
after the fight.

405
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,310
Did you tell her how it works?

406
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,103
What do you think?

407
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,447
Besides, she knows us.

408
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:03,519
Because she's already
done the job.

409
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,550
She only blew it once.

410
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:08,822
Once, but it was bad.

411
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:12,053
Midgets, I mean sending
us two midgets!

412
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,724
That was out of line.

413
00:39:14,051 --> 00:39:17,032
Midgets! You and I
are Lilliputians.

414
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,899
Midgets are for circuses.

415
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,700
You and I are wrestlers.

416
00:39:22,993 --> 00:39:24,529
Her mother is a midget!

417
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,503
Stop brooding on it.

418
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,802
It's not fair. Everyone
bugging me. I've had it!

419
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,846
My sainted mother and dad...

420
00:39:33,504 --> 00:39:36,485
...are normal, as are
my children and yours.

421
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:38,943
I am short...

422
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,582
...so my fuse is very short.

423
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,866
And how much is this
cheap brand?

424
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,625
The one that washes out.

425
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,758
What it says.

426
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,599
That's what hair dye costs here.
For grey or whatever.

427
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:58,968
Whatever brand.

428
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,440
But this says it only
lasts three weeks.

429
00:40:01,632 --> 00:40:03,433
Over time it doesn't add up.

430
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:03,935
How can it?

431
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,568
I don't set the prices.

432
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,378
It's a different story
in the supermarkets.

433
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,050
Go to the supermarket, then.

434
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:12,045
Do you have Neurocalm?

435
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,054
That's a controlled substance.

436
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,686
You need a prescription.

437
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,085
Well, you can keep your
dye for grey hair.

438
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,157
You probably want a
prescription for that, too.

439
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:27,398
Dear merciful Lord...

440
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:30,134
crush the enemies of my boys...

441
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,165
...may Satan fall upon them
and their strength not prevail.

442
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:35,037
Holy, holy, holy,

443
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:39,410
Lord of the armies, amen.

444
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,987
Don't try to sneak off
after the fight.

445
00:40:48,078 --> 00:40:49,489
No way.

446
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,456
You give me your pay
check before you go party.

447
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,995
And when you get home tomorrow...

448
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:57,495
...tell the women to come
for their house money.

449
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,200
Hey, ma...

450
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:06,206
Death says my uniform
is unworthy of me.

451
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:08,698
He says it's made of cheap cloth...

452
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,939
...and is a rag.

453
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:13,705
I had it made by the seamstress
who makes his, just so he knows.

454
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:15,542
What about the fabric?

455
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:18,114
The fabric...

456
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,087
That was your father's doing.

457
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,816
Don't you know him?

458
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,848
Didn't he stand you up
yesterday...

459
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,658
...when you were meeting
with the new second?

460
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,491
You know how he is.

461
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,163
One of these days...

462
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,966
...I'll take charge of
everything myself.

463
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:35,193
How can you?
You in the dressing room?

464
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,797
We'll be a laughingstock.

465
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,548
Make Dad shape up, Mom.

466
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,144
We take the business seriously.

467
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,690
Your dad turned out a drunk.

468
00:41:56,614 --> 00:41:57,888
It's God's will.

469
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,121
Don't gripe...

470
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,721
...or you'll lose for
all your griping.

471
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,521
Hey, ma...

472
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,967
Today's our day for hanky panky.

473
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:09,738
I'm going to give you
that little bonus right now.

474
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,807
After the fight we'll
be in a hurry.

475
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:13,607
Better now.

476
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,707
That way no one knows
you have money.

477
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,540
Take care.

478
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,615
You know there are some
sly ones in the ring.

479
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:23,242
We're not missing any limbs.

480
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,679
Not limbs...

481
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,588
...brains!

482
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,819
Go on, get to work.

483
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,759
When will we have the new capes?

484
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,663
When you're rich...

485
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:37,864
and give me money for brocade.

486
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:39,722
Go on ahead.

487
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,828
I'll catch up with you
with your dad.

488
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,729
It's not fair. Death's woman
buys and spends and...

489
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,903
...her husband doesn't complain.

490
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,033
But when the time comes
to share...

491
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:25,945
You get squat!

492
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,073
You wuss!

493
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,312
It's time you looked
out for us, for your own...

494
00:43:31,642 --> 00:43:34,844
...instead of drooling over your
famous brother and his wife...

495
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:37,689
...and the children of your
fucking undersized brother...

496
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,659
...because he is shorter
than you, I've checked!

497
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,736
You'll see!

498
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,639
A big man to hit your wife!

499
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,600
Take off your mask.

500
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,235
Dare to show your face!

501
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,140
Fucking faggot!

502
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,977
You have a hard-on
for your brother!

503
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:04,916
Midget on midget!

504
00:44:07,778 --> 00:44:10,088
You dumb bitch!

505
00:44:10,781 --> 00:44:13,383
Do you want him to fight
with his spirits in the dumps...

506
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,284
...feeling like a midget?

507
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,060
What do you think feeds you?

508
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,731
Does it bother you
that he loves his brother?

509
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,961
Adores his mother?

510
00:44:23,293 --> 00:44:27,002
What joins my two boys
is stronger than you.

511
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,210
They are united by
blood and destiny.

512
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:33,405
Born the same day, the same
blood, the same struggle.

513
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:35,805
The same everything.

514
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:38,719
Nothing and no one can
come between them.

515
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:41,146
Accept it and calm down.

516
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,289
Leave them alone.

517
00:44:43,981 --> 00:44:47,087
Today they work so you can eat.

518
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,730
The money isn't for me,
it's for your granddaughter.

519
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,456
Momma's boys!

520
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,334
Sissies!

521
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:59,104
Midgets though it hurts.
Midgets!

522
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,040
If I'm with him it's only
because I'm not choosy.

523
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,336
If you had listened to me.

524
00:45:07,337 --> 00:45:09,146
But who listens to their mother?

525
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:12,775
When you're in show
business, no family.

526
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,845
And if you're horny, then get
it on the side, no commitments.

527
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:17,413
But as for my permission...

528
00:45:17,414 --> 00:45:19,917
...you didn't even
ask my damn blessing.

529
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,158
What are you looking at?

530
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,231
Do you want to get between
me and my boys, too?

531
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,460
I'll wait outside.

532
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,837
Get this through your head!

533
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,700
Whatever happens...

534
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:37,272
...you two, like in my belly...

535
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,305
Q 0 tog ether!

536
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:43,145
No matter how they try
to separate you.

537
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:56,519
Did they give you
all the dough?

538
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,488
Don Ramiro will give me
the rest later.

539
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,332
Depending on how they do.

540
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,147
Adela, Adelita.

541
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,855
Give me a break.

542
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,883
I've got to get
this off my chest.

543
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,262
Maximino and me are still mad.

544
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:30,520
Come over here

545
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,798
there are a bunch of
snoops and gossips down there.

546
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,264
Gossips?
Because of the profession?

547
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,829
No, it's not that.

548
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:41,935
They just like to
screw with people.

549
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,445
It's just today.

550
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,818
One day is one day.

551
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,256
Don't look at me
like I'm an idiot.

552
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:02,023
You should be glad
yours turned out gay.

553
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,821
You can get out of
fornicating at home...

554
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,426
...and still service
the clients.

555
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,368
It's not the same.

556
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,404
I just wanted to be like them.

557
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,038
Watch TV, talk about my day,
be normal.

558
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,505
Like the ones in the tenement.

559
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,938
Like other people.

560
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,415
God protect you!

561
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,187
They are a bunch of assholes.

562
00:47:56,974 --> 00:47:59,147
I told you before and
you shined me on.

563
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:02,322
You haven't changed the gloves.

564
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:07,122
If you're going to be my shadow,
you have to get cracking.

565
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:10,159
If I say gloves...

566
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,266
...I mean your little gloves.

567
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,970
If I say cape,
I mean your little cape.

568
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:17,532
And so on.

569
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:20,563
If you can't keep up with me
and you give me a hard time...

570
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,298
...I'll take the franchise away.

571
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:25,371
I told you, next time.

572
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,582
Why the face, bro?

573
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:32,648
Little AK,
tell your brother to chill.

574
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,513
Come on

575
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:37,592
stop pouting.

576
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,288
Little Death is
really stubborn.

577
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,952
I told him what the
gloves should be like...

578
00:48:42,953 --> 00:48:44,933
...and he had them
made around here.

579
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:46,931
Get your shit together.

580
00:48:47,124 --> 00:48:49,001
Imitations show.

581
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,971
Soon, mom is making them.

582
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,471
Mothers should stay at home.

583
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:59,341
What is that about her
blessing you at the arena?

584
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:02,177
Tell your old lady...

585
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,310
...to
keep family fights at home.

586
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,179
You can go at it there.

587
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,656
I build a reputation...

588
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,491
...only for this diminished
version of me...

589
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:16,530
...to tear it down.

590
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,528
Stop it already!

591
00:49:18,722 --> 00:49:20,258
Let's go outside.

592
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,371
You crossed the line, man.

593
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,466
How will the little ones fight
after you chewed them out...

594
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,276
...in front of everyone?

595
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,373
The assholes are smug.

596
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,616
They know they move people.

597
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:42,088
That's why they do as they
please and get away with it.

598
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:45,684
Maybe they rely on their luck.

599
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:33,540
Here.

600
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:36,269
Don't worry, no problem.

601
00:50:51,181 --> 00:50:52,023
So?

602
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,022
So?

603
00:50:55,252 --> 00:50:56,287
Nothing...

604
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,362
...I mean...

605
00:50:59,322 --> 00:51:00,460
...nothing.

606
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:07,431
Adela.

607
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,435
I told you so.

608
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,414
With a little help
you're like a kid.

609
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:17,583
Why are you looking so happy?

610
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,179
I fixed things up with my Max.

611
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,415
You forgave him
for being a fruitcake?

612
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:26,491
That's nothing to forgive.

613
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,360
What pissed me off
was my clothes.

614
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:32,225
But the worst anger
comes to an end.

615
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,537
Did you find the
old prescription?

616
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,599
Let me see if it came
in today's shipment.

617
00:52:15,532 --> 00:52:18,479
That's what eye drops cost?

618
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:22,715
Child, don't you have something
the same but cheaper?

619
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,619
They've really gone up.
It's not fair.

620
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,815
Give me the rest.
It's not enough.

621
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,559
These are the only ones.

622
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,462
We'll take them.

623
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,701
So we don't mess up,
God forbid.

624
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:43,737
And we're in no condition
to waste money.

625
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,851
Put those damn drops away.

626
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,789
We don't want to make a
fuss and draw attention.

627
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:04,859
It's not like we
were beginners.

628
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:07,794
The times we did it
just fine, thank you.

629
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:10,889
I'm doing it for you.
What a life!

630
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:14,490
With all this distress,
our makeup ran.

631
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,625
- Let's touch ourselves up.
- What for?

632
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,867
So we don't turn them off.

633
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,550
That's different.

634
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:31,676
You see? You're not
so messed up.

635
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:33,778
You just needed a little help.

636
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:35,550
Look who's talking.

637
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,580
At least I look like a female.

638
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,527
I mean, I've got
flesh on my bones.

639
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,222
We're both pitiful.

640
00:53:42,285 --> 00:53:44,891
Neither you nor I can cut it.

641
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:47,264
Honey.

642
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,497
You look just like
Dolores del Rio.

643
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:56,307
Max, my husband, says my
problem is I have no bones.

644
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,974
You have a good skeleton
underneath you.

645
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,544
Just look...

646
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:04,851
...there's a silver lining
to your man being a pussy.

647
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:07,253
I thought you said
he wasn't queer.

648
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,914
Once doesn't count.

649
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:11,326
But if you want to
turn a blind eye...

650
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:13,622
I was born with a blind eye
and still have one.

651
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,856
Better blind than alone.

652
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:17,661
You think?

653
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:22,436
Hey.

654
00:54:23,693 --> 00:54:26,537
Do I really look like
Dolores del Rio?

655
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:29,668
Just look! High cheek bones.

656
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:49,685
I told you, they may be
small, but they're stars.

657
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:52,354
You see?
They're on the poster.

658
00:54:52,355 --> 00:54:55,268
Why don't we sneak into the
locker room and wait there.

659
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:57,635
To get out of the cold.

660
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,058
Time for the main event,

661
00:55:29,059 --> 00:55:34,059
and AK-47 and Death
are climbing into the ring...

662
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:39,046
...with their shadows,
Little Death and Little AK.

663
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,513
And here come Earthquake with Tremor,

664
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,825
and Geppetto with Little Pinocchio.

665
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,393
How big do you think they are?

666
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:07,098
Like this or tiny?
If it's little, all the better.

667
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,833
As if a lost mosquito
got inside of you...

668
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:13,781
...and that's it. You
don't feel a thing.

669
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,637
They pay for the hotel.

670
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:17,015
Well, we sure aren't.

671
00:56:17,073 --> 00:56:18,707
The same one?

672
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,477
They closed it. There's one
on the corner of the arena.

673
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,550
Sometimes they don't like
independent operators.

674
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:27,458
They're going to pick
and choose customers?

675
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,725
This neighborhood is
really run down.

676
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,055
I'm nervous.

677
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,093
As if it were my first time.

678
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:38,802
Rather than nervous,
you should be happy.

679
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:42,030
How long has it been since
you had a decent one?

680
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,374
With a trade.

681
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:44,700
Bathed.

682
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,375
Smelling of Sanborns lotion.

683
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,071
Sanborns lotion...

684
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,382
...I had forgotten about that.

685
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:54,015
You know why I got
an attack of nerves?

686
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:58,814
I mean, what if they like
us and grow fond of us...

687
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,523
...and give us an
allowance and all?

688
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,030
I like your pipe dreams.

689
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,001
They really are taking
their time.

690
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:11,732
What if there's another
exit in the back?

691
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,505
I told you.

692
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:20,705
Let's go, girls.

693
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,669
Who's paying?
Them or you?

694
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,672
Them, what do you think?

695
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,741
Payment is in advance.

696
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,680
Thanks.

697
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:13,651
And our money?

698
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:29,670
If we want anything else,
we'll let you know.

699
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:40,981
Are you always like that?
With the mask and all?

700
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:44,715
I mean, just to see your faces.

701
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:48,293
No offense, I mean
we are what we are.

702
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,798
First let's give the
evening some flavor.

703
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,856
Otherwise, it's bad luck.

704
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:57,296
Shall we strip now?

705
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,196
Or later?

706
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,167
Dance for us.

707
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:04,845
Yes, girl, dance for us.

708
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,722
No, no, no. With light.

709
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:27,963
With light.

710
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:38,166
Pretty, dance pretty!

711
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,204
Like that. Pretty!

712
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,929
Paint your mouth, you
look like a zombie.

713
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,264
And pour the guys a drink.

714
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:44,773
Alright. It's up to you.

715
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,111
Cheers!

716
01:01:48,471 --> 01:01:51,350
Aren't you going to take
the masks off even for that?

717
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:52,715
It's creepy...

718
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,377
You look like those little
plastic wrestlers...

719
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,756
...they used to sell at the
market when I was a kid.

720
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,385
No, we don't take them off.

721
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:03,018
It's a professional thing.

722
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,453
We see no faces.

723
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,400
But we know what's in the heart.

724
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,129
To each his own.

725
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,698
They're identical.

726
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:14,169
I don't mean to pry...

727
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,273
...but is it always like
this, a twosome?

728
01:02:17,333 --> 01:02:20,143
It's their thing.
I told you.

729
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:22,337
You don't understand.
You just don't understand.

730
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,182
I didn't say I understood,
that's why I asked.

731
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:28,188
Well, let's get to it, girl.

732
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:29,348
Cheers!

733
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,725
The thing is they're
downcast after the fight.

734
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,493
No way are we downcast!

735
01:02:35,218 --> 01:02:37,357
For your information, we won!

736
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,024
I told you, it would have been
better for them to see the fight.

737
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,933
Then we could talk to them.

738
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,939
We saw it, I swear!

739
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:49,037
If you saw it, what
did they sing to us?

740
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:53,776
It's not as if one remembers
everything one ever heard.

741
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:57,043
You big liar!

742
01:02:57,473 --> 01:03:00,283
Knock it off, bro!

743
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,946
Now let's get to it.

744
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,861
The midgets got pissed...

745
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:11,795
<i>'cause someone pinched
the midget Miss...</i>

746
01:03:11,888 --> 01:03:14,232
They got small,
and they got big.

747
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,463
Then they circled like a pig.

748
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,802
The midgets got pissed...

749
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,875
<i>'cause someone pinched
the midget Miss...</i>

750
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,064
They got small,
and they got big.

751
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:25,067
Then they circled like a pig.

752
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,205
The midgets got pissed...

753
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:29,283
<i>'cause someone pinched
the midget Miss...</i>

754
01:03:29,338 --> 01:03:31,473
They got small,
and they got big.

755
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:33,508
Then they circled like a pig.

756
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:35,785
The midgets got pissed...

757
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,858
<i>'cause someone pinched
the midget Miss...</i>

758
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,048
They got small,
and they got big.

759
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:41,858
Then they circled like a pig.

760
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,794
I'm out of breath.

761
01:03:44,954 --> 01:03:46,900
The little ones did
themselves proud.

762
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:50,167
That's all they have!

763
01:03:50,526 --> 01:03:52,836
And they won!

764
01:03:52,962 --> 01:03:54,964
They're short and stupid.

765
01:03:55,198 --> 01:03:56,506
But nice.

766
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:58,166
To each his own.

767
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,840
They treated us like ladies.

768
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,973
We are ladies, dummy.

769
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,475
They creep me out.

770
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,018
I don't know if it's their size
or because they're twins.

771
01:04:08,077 --> 01:04:09,920
But they creep me out.

772
01:04:15,852 --> 01:04:18,093
Don't wake them!

773
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:22,132
You peeper!

774
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:26,535
We all have our little things.

775
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,464
They like to do it together
with their masks on.

776
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,001
It's their life.

777
01:04:31,968 --> 01:04:33,470
Just look at them!

778
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:38,175
They look like two angels, with
their little masks and all!

779
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:51,921
Leave it on, or they might
notice and catch us.

780
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,305
Hurry up, we don't want
them waking up.

781
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:10,171
Those drops just knock
you out for a while.

782
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:11,583
They aren't anesthesia.

783
01:05:11,674 --> 01:05:14,245
I felt sorry for them.

784
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,880
What the fuck! Let's go!

785
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:16,150
Come on, what's it to you?

786
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,046
Just a quickie. Come on.

787
01:06:18,207 --> 01:06:21,211
And I won't bother you again.

788
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:24,179
What about the other day?

789
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,626
That was the other day.

790
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,262
Today is a new day.

791
01:06:29,585 --> 01:06:32,293
You grabbed me by the hair
in front of everyone!

792
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:35,660
What about my honor?

793
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,335
And worse yet,
what about yours?

794
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,136
What the fuck do I
care about my honor?

795
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:42,676
Weren't you out whoring?

796
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,635
You should have had enough.

797
01:06:45,568 --> 01:06:47,514
Go to sleep already.

798
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:51,206
Do you think some so and so
whose face I can't even see...

799
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:53,008
...is the same to me as you?

800
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,643
Fucking is fucking.

801
01:06:55,644 --> 01:06:57,453
Calm down already.

802
01:06:58,447 --> 01:07:00,188
Close your eyes.

803
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,060
Everything is alright.

804
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:08,465
If it's hard for you to
do it with me physically...

805
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:10,432
...then think of him.

806
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,093
Of who?

807
01:07:12,094 --> 01:07:14,631
The kid from the other day.

808
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:16,438
There you go again!

809
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:20,545
You can borrow my clothes.

810
01:07:21,237 --> 01:07:23,649
I swear. All of them.

811
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:27,787
I'll stretch them out,
they won't fit you.

812
01:08:37,646 --> 01:08:40,855
They had it coming.

813
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:16,246
That wasn't worth
running away over.

814
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,923
Hey, listen,
we need more policing.

815
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,688
This is a never ending story.

816
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:58,424
Every night there's a crowd.

817
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:00,589
This was bound to happen.

818
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,603
Drunks, yelling, streetwalkers.

819
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:09,006
Hey, is it true it was
the little wrestlers?

820
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,666
Come in here.

821
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,374
I want to ask you
some questions.

822
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:18,714
Don't go all crazy.

823
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,981
Just tell me what you know
and what you don't.

824
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:23,789
I only know this is a
by the hour hotel.

825
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,883
And the neighbors are
not happy about it.

826
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,461
And with the scandal
about to break...

827
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,394
What scandal is that?

828
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,965
Do you really not know
who they are?

829
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,600
So it's really true.

830
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,407
Stop handling the evidence.

831
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,671
Then the coroners
give me a hard time.

832
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,512
What?

833
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:57,776
What?

834
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,816
How? How?

835
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,617
How?

836
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:26,611
They killed our boys.

837
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,060
My children!

838
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:56,970
Where did they spend the night?

839
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,993
Where is my little boy?

840
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:01,128
How should I know why
he didn't come home?

841
01:15:01,129 --> 01:15:03,666
They're your children,
you knew them first.

842
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,115
Tell me he's here!

843
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,807
That it isn't true.

844
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:15,649
That what they are saying
out there isn't true.

845
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,600
Not my children!

846
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:35,634
Not my children!

847
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,987
Why would I ask?

848
01:16:23,045 --> 01:16:25,855
In this life, they teach
you not to get involved.

849
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,121
Yes, ma'am, I understand that.

850
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,252
But you also have to
check out the customers.

851
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,733
It's your responsibility.

852
01:16:33,789 --> 01:16:34,956
Why me?

853
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,758
How was I to know those
midgets would bring the press?

854
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:42,640
Ah, so you did notice
that they were little people...

855
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:47,169
...and you must have also
checked out the harlots.

856
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:50,304
I already told you they were
two messed up old women.

857
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,006
I didn't see their faces.

858
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,908
They were wearing masks.

859
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:56,711
And if I had seen them,
it wouldn't have mattered.

860
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:58,191
I don't know anything
about wrestling...

861
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,147
...boxing or any of that!

862
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:02,651
God save me from being
involved in such crap!

863
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:04,959
Did you know the women?

864
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,921
Were they regulars?

865
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:08,924
Did they use your establishment?

866
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:11,392
Didn't I tell you
they were wrecks?

867
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,839
The Laredo Hotel is
a serious hotel.

868
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:16,205
Ha, the Laredo!

869
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,301
Where are my boys?

870
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,267
I've come for my boys!

871
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:22,908
My children!
My little boys!

872
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:26,874
Tell me they are OK,
that it was just talk, untruths.

873
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,719
Ma'am, who are you looking for?

874
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:32,987
Swear it isn't true!
That it's a joke.

875
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:36,392
A joke to break
your heart in two!

876
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,352
Alright, let's start
at the beginning.

877
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,221
Who are your children?

878
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:43,324
Little AK and Little Death,
the shadow wrestlers...

879
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,305
...of AK-47 and Death.

880
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:49,075
Don't say their names!

881
01:17:49,698 --> 01:17:52,266
It's like calling
fate and saying:

882
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:55,077
Com e, come take them!

883
01:17:55,437 --> 01:17:58,043
Then how will
he understand you?

884
01:17:58,306 --> 01:18:01,719
Are you really their parents?

885
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,011
You, ma'am, are you the mother?

886
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,313
That's me and this
is their father.

887
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:08,157
Normal as I am.

888
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:11,992
But my little twins
came out small.

889
01:18:13,288 --> 01:18:17,998
How do you explain
their peculiar tastes?

890
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,438
Don't talk to me
about peculiar tastes!

891
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,006
They were good sons,
good husbands.

892
01:18:23,065 --> 01:18:26,342
They both had normal
children, healthy ones.

893
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:29,382
With good size, their children,
all of them are tall.

894
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,073
What have they done to them?

895
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:36,143
Ma'am, go home quietly
with your husband...

896
01:18:36,144 --> 01:18:38,920
...while we investigate the case.

897
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,893
I am very sorry, really.
My condolences.

898
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:44,863
What good are your condolences?

899
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,726
I want justice!

900
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:49,090
Justice for my children!

901
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:50,866
I demand it!

902
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:53,894
Don't tell me what to do!
Go to hell!

903
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,705
Lady, go home.
I will call you.

904
01:19:08,443 --> 01:19:10,354
So?

905
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:20,054
Two senior sex workers
from the area...

906
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:24,859
knocked the famous look alike
wrestlers out with eye drops.

907
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:29,860
Insecurity in the area scares off
clients of ordinary businesses.

908
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:33,968
The facial composites
will be released soon..

909
01:19:33,969 --> 01:19:36,882
Hey, what's the name of the
policeman who's always at the cafÃ©?

910
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,216
I don't know,
there are lots of them.

911
01:19:41,343 --> 01:19:43,345
I'll be right back.

912
01:19:53,488 --> 01:19:55,764
It'll blow over in a couple
of days. You'll see.

913
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:59,164
In this cursed city, no scandal
survives the weekend.

914
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:02,535
It's not about what they
did, you fool.

915
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,503
It's about the droppers.

916
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:10,004
The TV keeps saying that's
the method all the whores...

917
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:11,839
...in our area are using.

918
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:14,480
The whole city has
thieving harlots.

919
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,184
Yeah, but these are droppers.

920
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:20,281
They say it's a mafia.

921
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:24,025
That they knock out their
marks with eye drops.

922
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,864
Just five or six drops.

923
01:20:30,258 --> 01:20:32,534
Wait!

924
01:20:33,995 --> 01:20:35,065
I know!

925
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,339
I just thought of it.

926
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:41,176
They used the normal
dose on the midgets.

927
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:44,243
That's why the morons
killed them.

928
01:20:46,241 --> 01:20:49,381
They overdid it!

929
01:20:49,477 --> 01:20:50,845
Morons!

930
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:51,916
Of course...

931
01:20:52,214 --> 01:20:54,285
...but that
changes everything.

932
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:58,430
They didn't want to kill them,
they were just dumb.

933
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:02,301
Therefore, there is no plot...

934
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:05,336
...no mafia, no accomplices.

935
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:08,535
And everything will calm down.

936
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:13,139
If the press come,
that's what we have to say.

937
01:21:59,447 --> 01:22:04,157
I'm going to give them a rosary
to accompany them to heaven.

938
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:06,965
There's only one.

939
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:10,527
They asked for this.

940
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:15,071
Dressed alike...

941
01:22:17,165 --> 01:22:19,577
...as always.

942
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:24,350
With their little
wrestling outfits.

943
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:31,179
All gold thread.

944
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:36,621
Take a picture of me.

945
01:22:36,952 --> 01:22:40,058
Take a picture of me with them.

946
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:01,585
Why do you do it?

947
01:23:02,577 --> 01:23:04,614
Did you see them fight?

948
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:08,991
Or were you seeing
one of them on the sly?

949
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:13,026
Or what?

950
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,104
Because they were little.

951
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:24,643
The wrestling world is
dismayed over the death...

952
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:26,542
...of the twin wrestlers.

953
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:30,070
These Lilliputian gladiators...

954
01:23:30,071 --> 01:23:33,540
...known as Little Death
and Little AK were, in life...

955
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:37,378
...the replicas or mascots
of the master grapplers:

956
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,985
Death and AK-47.

957
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:42,116
The police announced...

958
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:45,452
...that the hotel video made
possible a police sketch...

959
01:23:45,453 --> 01:23:49,156
...of the sex workers
who accompanied the brothers.

960
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:53,293
Inside sources revealed that,
though of poor quality...

961
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:57,436
...the tape sufficed to
identify the sex workers.

962
01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:02,646
Did I ever show you
my little angel?

963
01:24:04,372 --> 01:24:06,147
Touch it!

964
01:24:06,775 --> 01:24:08,609
Don't be shy.

965
01:24:08,610 --> 01:24:11,022
It won't bite you.

966
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:14,782
No one ever touched it.

967
01:24:14,783 --> 01:24:16,592
Can you believe it?

968
01:24:30,098 --> 01:24:31,098
Hey!

969
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:34,376
I thought we were splitting up.

970
01:24:34,436 --> 01:24:39,078
They are on TV and everywhere.

971
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:42,414
You'd think we did
in two big shots.

972
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,124
- Little shots.
- Don't joke about it.

973
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,296
They've caught us.

974
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:53,261
I don't want them to torture me.

975
01:24:53,788 --> 01:24:57,235
What will be, will be.

976
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:13,450
Juanes, let's go.
We have them.

977
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:42,876
MÃ©rgara!

978
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:51,323
You know what they say.

979
01:25:52,614 --> 01:25:55,288
Just relax and enjoy it.

980
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:02,766
You know all the
whores in the area.

981
01:26:05,894 --> 01:26:07,794
I don't deny I know them...

982
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:10,241
...but those two don't
work for me anymore.

983
01:26:17,272 --> 01:26:20,440
Are you going to tell me
where I can find them...

984
01:26:20,441 --> 01:26:22,676
Or play hard to get?

985
01:26:22,677 --> 01:26:24,678
I swear I had no part in it.

986
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:27,216
Do you think I'm going to
let them be so stupid?

987
01:26:49,804 --> 01:26:51,715
You see, MÃ©rgara?

988
01:26:52,507 --> 01:26:54,885
Always so cooperative.

989
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:57,480
Juanes.

990
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:01,661
Let's go get them.

991
01:28:12,787 --> 01:28:14,321
Ma!

992
01:28:14,322 --> 01:28:16,928
Some policemen
searched the room.

993
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:18,832
Of course I saw.

994
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:22,932
Yes, they've left.

995
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:27,711
You're back to your old ways,
but you sure chewed me out.

996
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,507
Of course I'm going to
leave, I'm not stupid!

997
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:34,576
I'll call grandma and
catch the first bus.

998
01:28:34,776 --> 01:28:37,017
Send me money.

999
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:39,813
You old fool!

1000
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:43,489
You get into all kinds of trouble
and don't know how to get out.

1001
01:28:44,385 --> 01:28:46,058
And what about me?

1002
01:28:47,021 --> 01:28:48,432
What about me?

1003
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:57,831
No, Adela, we are in
this to the end.

1004
01:28:57,832 --> 01:28:59,709
No, Adela, we are in
this to the end.

1005
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:02,771
If I run, you run with me,
that's all there is to it.

1006
01:29:02,837 --> 01:29:03,870
And why is that?

1007
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:04,906
Why what?

1008
01:29:04,972 --> 01:29:06,807
Didn't you hear what Jeza said?

1009
01:29:06,808 --> 01:29:09,414
They went looking for me.
And they will soon come for you.

1010
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:11,578
And if they catch me,
they catch you...

1011
01:29:11,579 --> 01:29:13,647
...no matter if
I'm far from home.

1012
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:16,383
I have never been a snitch.

1013
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,795
For your knowledge.

1014
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:20,692
And this won't be the first
time I've been in the joint.

1015
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:22,489
You act tough.

1016
01:29:22,490 --> 01:29:26,097
At the first shock you'll
spill everything you know.

1017
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:28,637
You'll go down and take me down.

1018
01:29:28,730 --> 01:29:30,971
- Well, don't tell me.
- What?

1019
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:33,878
Just don't tell me
where you're going.

1020
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:38,645
They come, they shake me
around and that's it.

1021
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:41,808
Because I have nothing
to tell them.

1022
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:43,877
What if you make something up?

1023
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:45,645
To make it worse?

1024
01:29:45,646 --> 01:29:48,058
No way, JosÃ©.

1025
01:29:48,916 --> 01:29:53,653
You split and I tell
them this conversation.

1026
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,429
And there's an end to it.

1027
01:29:55,623 --> 01:29:58,797
I'm too old to be on the run.

1028
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,668
Look.

1029
01:30:03,664 --> 01:30:07,033
After a while in jail,
they forget about you...

1030
01:30:07,034 --> 01:30:09,169
...and you get along fine.

1031
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:12,947
You eat, have a roof
over your head...

1032
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,488
...a blanket.

1033
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,145
It's great.

1034
01:30:18,146 --> 01:30:20,013
Rig ht, just dandy.

1035
01:30:20,014 --> 01:30:22,082
I don't know why
I hang out with an idiot.

1036
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,757
Adela, come off it!
Come on!

1037
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:26,787
I don't want to leave you.

1038
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:29,489
I left my husband,
and now Jeza.

1039
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:31,558
I can't go looking
for her for years!

1040
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:33,903
Why get her involved?

1041
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:36,430
But I wasn't meant to be alone!

1042
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,605
Come on. We can
make it together!

1043
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,148
Alright then.

1044
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:51,786
After all...

1045
01:30:52,046 --> 01:30:55,721
...you and I have always
walked on Bleak Street.

1046
01:31:31,886 --> 01:31:35,121
Adela, this is no time
for a performance.

1047
01:31:35,122 --> 01:31:36,601
Let'; go!

1048
01:31:36,991 --> 01:31:39,995
I hate to leave her there,
like furniture.

1049
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:42,200
Someone is bound to
come up and find her.

1050
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:44,965
Besides, you're already on
TV and in the newspapers.

1051
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:46,900
They're going to come
looking for you.

1052
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:48,710
They love a disturbance.

1053
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:50,804
You're lacking Christian charity.

1054
01:31:50,805 --> 01:31:51,738
And you're lacking brains.

1055
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:52,547
Let's go.

1056
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:57,654
Leave the dead to
bury their own.

1057
01:31:57,712 --> 01:31:59,246
Do you know Salina Cruz?

1058
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:01,727
I don't know anyone
who has ever been there.

1059
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:03,955
That's the best recommendation.

1060
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:06,286
Do you have any drops left?

1061
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:08,563
Come off it.

1062
01:32:09,590 --> 01:32:13,527
And leave my old woman
to die here like a dog?

1063
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:17,943
No. I wouldn't do that
to anyone.

1064
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,107
Especially not my old woman.

1065
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:58,307
How could I just leave
you like that?

1066
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,084
My old woman.

1067
01:33:03,177 --> 01:33:05,088
Goodbye.

1068
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:08,693
I have to go.

1069
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:23,964
You think you're smart...

1070
01:33:23,965 --> 01:33:26,571
...but you were dumb enough
to hold onto the drops.

1071
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:29,143
They were expensive.

1072
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,008
That's them.

1073
01:34:47,148 --> 01:34:49,253
Just because they were midgets.

1074
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:51,384
If they had been normal...

1075
01:34:51,385 --> 01:34:53,661
...no one would have balked.

1076
01:34:53,788 --> 01:34:57,861
Next time, I'm steering
clear of freaks.

1077
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:02,306
If you hadn't been saying
goodbye to the old woman...

1078
01:35:02,463 --> 01:35:05,774
But you always did have
a screw loose.

1079
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:11,143
I know. Sooner or later
they were bound to catch us.

1080
01:35:12,807 --> 01:35:14,878
But I'm really scared.

1081
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:00,932
Hey.

1082
01:36:02,823 --> 01:36:04,268
Don't be mean.

1083
01:36:04,992 --> 01:36:07,438
Let me say goodbye.

1084
01:36:07,962 --> 01:36:11,331
Who knows when we'll
see each other again.

1085
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:13,533
She's my family...

1086
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:16,208
...she's all I've got.

1087
01:36:17,471 --> 01:36:19,212
What did you want?

1088
01:36:22,009 --> 01:36:24,819
I just wanted to tell
her not to be distressed.

1089
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:28,824
That it was fate.

1090
01:36:30,885 --> 01:36:33,126
That all things pass.

1091
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:35,367
BLEAK STREET
