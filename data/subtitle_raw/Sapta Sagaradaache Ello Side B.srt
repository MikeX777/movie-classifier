1
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,541
After I got out,
 he was incharge of the whole factory.

2
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,916
So, Venky is a hotshot now!

3
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,041
Is it so?

4
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,291
Gali must not be happy about this.

5
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,416
Have you spoken to Patil?

6
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,416
I don't know...

7
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,791
He writes to me once in a while.

8
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,916
He is working in some Gandhi ashram.

9
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,291
Manu, this is your room.

10
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,541
My cab owner owns this building.

11
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,291
You can stay here for a few days.

12
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:32,791
The bathroom is on the terrace.

13
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,541
The key is kept there.

14
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:35,541
Ok.

15
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,166
Sorry. Itâ€™s a little messy.

16
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,541
This is good.

17
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,041
Have you thought about getting a job?

18
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,166
I have enlisted
 for the jail programme.

19
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:58,666
Good. Keep this money.
 Youâ€™ll need it.

20
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,416
Charge your phone.
 It runs out of battery quickly.

21
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,791
And like I said earlier,

22
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:07,291
It's tough to adjust to reality
 just after getting out.

23
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:08,416
Donâ€™t worry about it.

24
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:10,666
Think of the world as a bigger jail.

25
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,416
That thing...

26
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,541
Itâ€™s in the bag. Take it.

27
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,041
You need lots of space
 when you begin a new life.

28
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,541
So donâ€™t forget to let go of the past.

29
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,166
Okay then, bye.

30
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,541
Call me if you need anything.

31
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,916
The day you get out of jail,
 Iâ€™ve planned a huge celebration.

32
00:04:53,916 --> 00:04:56,666
Iâ€™ll decorate the whole house.

33
00:04:57,416 --> 00:05:00,916
Vinodha proposed lighting up
 the streets for your welcome.

34
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,041
I said, youâ€™ll run back to
 jail out of embarrassment.

35
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,291
I know you like my motherâ€™s
 fish curry...

36
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,416
Iâ€™ve learnt to make it.

37
00:05:12,541 --> 00:05:15,291
And Iâ€™ll make tons of sweet sajjige!

38
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,666
After coming out of jail,
 I know itâ€™ll take some time to get settled.

39
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:24,291
So, you will get special treatment
 only for few days.

40
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,416
But after that, if you stay lazy,
 I wonâ€™t spare you.

41
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:33,666
I want you to work hard and
 take good care of me...

42
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:34,916
Like a queen.

43
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,291
The file says you worked hard in jail.

44
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:52,541
Jail quota workers have to
 follow very strict rules here.

45
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,416
Do your job well.

46
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,041
Youâ€™ll face no problems.

47
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,041
When this programme started,
 Patil had requested for one thing -

48
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:03,416
To give incomplete jobs
 to people who are out of prison.

49
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,416
For now start work at the fabric section.

50
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:11,541
"I'll await you forever"

51
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:19,916
"Longing for you"

52
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:25,041
"In your path I linger"

53
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,291
Idiot!

54
00:06:35,416 --> 00:06:39,791
"Somewhere beyond the seven seas"

55
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,041
Go and get some sleep!

56
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,291
Iâ€™ve filled fuel.

57
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:59,291
"You fill my mind"

58
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:03,791
"You define my smile"

59
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:05,791
"Every moment I got"

60
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,416
"Your soulful tune"

61
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:09,291
"Becomes my thought"

62
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,291
"You are my happiness"

63
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:33,166
I keep thinking of our trip to Madikeri.

64
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,666
The room we stayed in.

65
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,541
The gentle sound of the rain.

66
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:44,666
The way you hugged me close and slept.

67
00:07:47,916 --> 00:07:48,916
Your breath.

68
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:51,541
Our laughter.

69
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,541
The way you looked at me.
 I remember it all even today.

70
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:01,041
I can never forget it

71
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,041
Idiot...

72
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,166
Will you promise me one thing?

73
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:13,291
Once you get out...

74
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:17,666
Will you hold me tight and sleep the same way?

75
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,791
Prakasha...

76
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:39,666
I donâ€™t feel right ...

77
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,166
Ask them to cancel.

78
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,833
Aye, donâ€™t feel right it seems.
 So many years have passed

79
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,541
Donâ€™t you eat when you are hungry?

80
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,416
This is also the same way, ok?

81
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:53,166
If a married guy like me goes, then its not right.

82
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,916
You donâ€™t have anyone right Manu?

83
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,291
Donâ€™t overthink this.

84
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,041
Understood?

85
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,166
Theyâ€™ll sell you stories, to get more money.

86
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,458
Be careful. Dont overpay.

87
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:02,916
A white Qualis is here.

88
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:03,791
Ahh yes.. Thatâ€™s the one.

89
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,416
Hope you know the rates and rules.

90
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,666
Select the girl.

91
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:15,916
Show him.

92
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,916
The one with the headphones...

93
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,416
Wait over there. She will come to you.

94
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,791
The usual.

95
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,041
Do you know how to sing?

96
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,666
I can sing and make you sing also.

97
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:31,791
Come.

98
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,791
"The broken pieces have come together."

99
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,416
"It casts your image"

100
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:54,416
"How do I trust myself anymore?"

101
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,291
"The mind, fickle"

102
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,666
"The eyes, restless"

103
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:07,791
"How do I trust myself anymore?"

104
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:44,666
"Oh veiled mirage"

105
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:48,291
"I've come to you"

106
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,666
Thought this was your first time...
 Not bad.

107
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:58,791
"Are you my mirage?"

108
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:05,916
"Is it true?"

109
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,041
Hey, what happened?

110
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,166
So who is it?

111
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,291
Who?

112
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,166
Your eyes were shut the whole time.

113
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,291
Hence, I asked.

114
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:43,916
Who is she?

115
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,166
An old flame?

116
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,791
Or a next door hottie?

117
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,041
It could also be because
 you donâ€™t have a pretty face.

118
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:02,291
People come here to do â€˜itâ€™

119
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,166
Not to make love.

120
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,666
So who is this pretty princess?

121
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,916
A dream from a past life.

122
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,166
Ah! A poet!

123
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,041
So what happened to that dream?

124
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,416
I woke up from it!

125
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,666
Whatâ€™s your name?

126
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,666
Manu

127
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,541
And whatâ€™s your real name?

128
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:30,666
Why? Surabhi isnâ€™t good enough?

129
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:33,541
Okay

130
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,666
How did this happen?

131
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:40,916
Is it hard on your eyes?

132
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,916
Yes, a little! But I can adjust.

133
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:47,416
Do one thing.

134
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:49,916
Next time,
 even you close your eyes.

135
00:13:55,541 --> 00:13:56,916
I like you.

136
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,291
Can you sing a song?

137
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,166
Which one?

138
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,041
I had such a wonderful
 dream the other day!

139
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:05,416
There was a loud sound and it woke me up.

140
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:09,041
I tried hard to revisit the dream, but couldnâ€™t

141
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:10,916
You know what that dream is?

142
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:14,541
I had taken you to the
 beach in our village.

143
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,041
Not a single soul in sight!

144
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,416
Just you and me on the beach!

145
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,541
We were walking by the sea

146
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:26,291
And the waves were washing off our footprints.

147
00:15:26,791 --> 00:15:29,041
I was holding your hand tight.

148
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,666
You know how happy we were?

149
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:35,541
I can still hear the waves, when I close my eyes.

150
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,666
Can you hear it too?

151
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:05,291
Hello?

152
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:08,416
Hello?

153
00:16:10,166 --> 00:16:11,041
Who is it?

154
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,666
Where are you off to with that bag?

155
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,166
I wanted to go to the sea.

156
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:51,958
Good idea. It will be a good change for you.

157
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,541
When are you leaving?

158
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,416
I wanted to see Priya before going.

159
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,416
Can we trace her location
 using her number?

160
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:08,541
Man...

161
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:10,791
Have you lost your mind?

162
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,666
Why do you want Priya now?

163
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:15,541
I just want to see her before leaving.

164
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,041
Ah!

165
00:17:18,791 --> 00:17:20,916
And what exactly do you plan to do?

166
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,666
I don't know.

167
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:26,791
Manu, listen to me.

168
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,541
Sheâ€™s will be busy with her own family.

169
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,916
Youâ€™ll make it difficult for her...
 Do you understand?

170
00:17:32,541 --> 00:17:33,916
No, I just want to see her onceâ€¦

171
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,916
That story ended long ago.
 Drop it now!

172
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:37,916
Restart your life and move on.

173
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,791
The other night...

174
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:47,166
You went to â€˜thatâ€™ place...

175
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,791
Find some girl there and settle down.

176
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,041
Ok?

177
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,041
Your customer is here...

178
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,541
Hello loverboy!

179
00:18:14,166 --> 00:18:15,666
Was my singing that good?

180
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,666
You will get better with practice.

181
00:18:19,041 --> 00:18:20,041
Practice?

182
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,416
Thereâ€™s a lodge nearby...

183
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:24,291
For a two hour booking,
 You get one hour free.

184
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:25,791
Come, letâ€™s go and practice.

185
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:28,083
No.

186
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,666
Letâ€™s watch a film instead?

187
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:35,041
A film?

188
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,791
Darling! I kind of like you.

189
00:18:38,916 --> 00:18:40,416
Thatâ€™s why I am not losing it.

190
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:42,541
I am in this profession for survival

191
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,416
-Not to roam around like a girlfriend.
 -Iâ€™ll pay you..

192
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:46,791
In full.

193
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,666
Idiot, watch the film!

194
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:19,916
Do you like the sea?

195
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:24,541
That heat, humidity, and the stench of fishâ€¦
 I canâ€™t bear it.

196
00:19:24,916 --> 00:19:27,166
Why? Are you going?

197
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:56,166
At what time?

198
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,041
Can't you send Reema?

199
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,666
Okay fine, Iâ€™ll come.

200
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,666
I have another customer.

201
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,041
Nobody chooses to be in
 this profession.

202
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,041
I know.

203
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:21,791
-Actually, my motherâ€¦
 -Oye...

204
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:24,291
I didnâ€™t ask.

205
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:29,541
What would. you have liked to do instead?

206
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:40,166
I wanted to study well and become a doctor.

207
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,166
Can you do me a favour?

208
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,666
What?

209
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:54,541
I will give you a number...

210
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,666
Can you find out the location?

211
00:20:57,666 --> 00:20:58,541
Whose?

212
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:02,541
Your pretty princess?

213
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,041
What do you plan to do?

214
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,666
I want to kidnap her.

215
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:13,916
I havenâ€™t planned the details yet.

216
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:20,541
Please?*

217
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,541
Iâ€™ll think about it.

218
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:29,541
This is my stop.

219
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,041
Catch you later.

220
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:39,041
Hello, am I speaking to Priya?

221
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:43,541
Madam, this is a call from the
 Covid Vaccination Centre.

222
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:46,583
We need your details madam.

223
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:52,166
"The pain, up close and intense"

224
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,791
"The resolution, just a pretence."

225
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,916
"Feel breathless, unable to call out to you"

226
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:08,166
"Life's rudderless, all alone without you."

227
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:16,041
"This wound will always fester"

228
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:22,541
"I've survived through this spectre."

229
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:28,541
"Listen to me, my breath"

230
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:34,916
"My ever so wavering breath."

231
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:41,541
"Look at me, my breath"

232
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:50,791
"I've borne this suffering, my breath."

233
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,250
Manu, I know you really well...

234
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,791
You better not rush me to make babies.

235
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,583
If you do, then it's your loss.

236
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:29,458
Because all my love will
 go to our child and not you.

237
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,750
And one more thing...
 Iâ€™ll be the deciding the kidâ€™s name.

238
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:00,916
No school today?

239
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,166
No ... because of Covid

240
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,416
What are you doing here then?

241
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,583
Can I have my ball back?

242
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,458
Whatâ€™s your name?

243
00:24:09,916 --> 00:24:10,666
Puneeth.

244
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,458
Can I also play with you?

245
00:24:12,666 --> 00:24:14,166
What happened to your face?

246
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:17,416
I fell off the bike.

247
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,833
Were you speeding?

248
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:21,708
Yes.

249
00:24:22,416 --> 00:24:26,166
My mother scolds my father if he speeds.

250
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,291
Can I also play with you?

251
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:40,916
"Does the silent lute have strings of words?"

252
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,041
What are you doing at a shop like this, Putti?

253
00:24:48,083 --> 00:24:53,958
"On the wall of darkness I've scrawled my pain,
 Can you read it once?"

254
00:24:54,291 --> 00:24:58,166
"Just once?"

255
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:06,583
"Despite calling out aloud"

256
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:13,791
"Can a finished story have a new beginning?"

257
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:18,708
"Despite the long wait..."

258
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:24,041
"My desire for you will never end"

259
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,541
"Will never end."

260
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:31,041
"Listen to me, my breath"

261
00:25:34,041 --> 00:25:40,166
"My ever so wavering breath."

262
00:25:40,666 --> 00:25:46,791
"Look at me, my breath"

263
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:53,416
"I've borne this suffering my breath."

264
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:22,541
Manu, before you bought your bike

265
00:26:23,208 --> 00:26:26,083
Remember how we used to walk and talk so much?

266
00:26:27,166 --> 00:26:28,166
When I think about it now...

267
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,291
I wonder what we talked about so much.

268
00:26:34,166 --> 00:26:35,416
After dinner...

269
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,916
Before we sleep, we have to go for a walk, okay?

270
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:15,833
Where is your husband Putti?

271
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:18,833
How does it matter to
 you where her husband is!

272
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,416
Something isnâ€™t right.

273
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:26,041
To see her and her kid...

274
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:27,291
Poor thing...

275
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,666
Are you kidding me?

276
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:31,291
Poor thing??? Is it your child?

277
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:34,083
I should admit you to a mental hospital.

278
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:36,208
Itâ€™s been 10 years!

279
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:37,833
Give me one more.

280
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,041
She is living her own life.

281
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:43,916
She doesn't even know if youâ€™re dead or alive.

282
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,041
You wanted to see her
 one last time, isnâ€™t it?

283
00:27:57,958 --> 00:27:58,958
And you did.

284
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:00,208
And thatâ€™s enough.

285
00:28:01,208 --> 00:28:03,958
How does it concern
 you where her husband is?

286
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,791
Please donâ€™t even think about her again.

287
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:09,666
Manu, do you understand?

288
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:32,083
One quarter and a glass.

289
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:32,833
Rs. 110

290
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,541
Hello?

291
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:50,583
-Give me water...
 -Just a moment.

292
00:28:51,958 --> 00:28:54,083
Getting stuff for the house is not my job.

293
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,041
If I have to do everything,
 then I don't want this marriage.

294
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:00,166
I will drop you back to jail.

295
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,958
Where were you all these days?

296
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:10,708
I thought you eloped with your
 pretty princess!

297
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:13,958
Did you meet her?

298
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,583
I can't just meet her!

299
00:29:21,583 --> 00:29:22,458
Is she married?

300
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:26,958
Is she at least happy?

301
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,291
So itâ€™s that kind of story, huh?

302
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:35,208
What kind?

303
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:41,458
(Sings a tragic love song)

304
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:44,291
Oh come on!

305
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,958
Itâ€™s rare for love stories to ever work out.

306
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:50,666
Most of them end with an ocean of tears!

307
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,333
If you don't learn from one heartbreak.

308
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,708
You shouldn't value love so much.

309
00:29:57,666 --> 00:29:58,333
What's your height?

310
00:29:59,083 --> 00:29:59,583
Why?

311
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:01,666
Why?!

312
00:30:03,541 --> 00:30:05,333
When you can't reach the grapes
 they will seem sour.

313
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,291
How dare you!

314
00:30:08,708 --> 00:30:11,416
What do you know about me to say that huh?

315
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:16,708
There is no guarantee sheâ€™d have
 been happy if she was with you.

316
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:20,666
Even I donâ€™t know.

317
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,958
Iâ€™ve seen many people
 whoâ€™ve messed up their lives.

318
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,083
Why donâ€™t you get married?

319
00:30:38,291 --> 00:30:41,666
Donâ€™t waste your time on
 useless things like feelings and love.

320
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:46,541
Hey!

321
00:30:47,041 --> 00:30:50,166
Why are you walking around with a
 mangalsutra like itâ€™s candy!

322
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:52,708
Where do you want to get married?

323
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,583
In a mental hospital!

324
00:30:56,708 --> 00:30:57,458
Mad fellow!

325
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:01,791
If you were giving me one,
 instead of a fake...

326
00:31:02,166 --> 00:31:03,666
Had you given me real gold...

327
00:31:03,708 --> 00:31:05,291
I could have pawned it for money.

328
00:31:05,833 --> 00:31:07,208
The money is in the purse.

329
00:31:12,416 --> 00:31:13,541
It looks good on you.

330
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,791
Ah! The smell of fish is inviting!

331
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:29,791
I'm so hungry.

332
00:31:41,791 --> 00:31:43,666
-Hey you! Come here.
 -Sir

333
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:45,166
Come here!

334
00:31:45,833 --> 00:31:46,666
What the hell is this?

335
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:47,333
What happened Sir?

336
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,916
Have you served me fish
 thatâ€™s been rotting for six months?

337
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:50,416
Prakashâ€¦

338
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,208
And your hotel is called Karavali Fresh!

339
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,208
Who is the owner?

340
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,041
Leave it...

341
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:54,958
Letâ€™s go elsewhere.

342
00:31:54,958 --> 00:31:55,833
You go call him.

343
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:57,291
What are you staring at? Go call him.

344
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,541
Let it go.

345
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,583
Hold on. You go call him.

346
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:01,166
Call him!

347
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:01,916
Let it go.

348
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:03,708
You go and get him.

349
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:04,458
Call him up.

350
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:05,083
Prakasha...

351
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,791
-Tell him to come now!
 -Letâ€™s not cause a scene.

352
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:08,833
This is Deepakâ€™s hotel.

353
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:09,916
Who the hell is he?

354
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:12,583
Priyaâ€™s husband.

355
00:32:16,708 --> 00:32:17,041
Sit down.

356
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,083
You lured me here with the
 promise of a good fish meal.

357
00:32:33,208 --> 00:32:34,208
Have you no shame?

358
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,083
Despite my telling you not to,
 you go and see her.

359
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,208
Heâ€™s not taking good care of her.

360
00:32:42,708 --> 00:32:45,083
Look at the condition of this hotel!

361
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:48,916
Sheâ€™s not happy.

362
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,458
You ass, sheâ€™s not some fish meal!

363
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:57,416
Iâ€™m warning you Manu. This is not right.

364
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,833
Iâ€™m tired of warning you.

365
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:05,208
And if you go back to see her
 husband, son, dog and catâ€¦.

366
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,083
I will stop talking to you.

367
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,708
Okay come, letâ€™s go before he comes.

368
00:33:14,416 --> 00:33:14,708
No.

369
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,666
He only comes here after 5 pm.

370
00:33:25,833 --> 00:33:26,333
One minute...

371
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:27,083
What?

372
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:28,958
I forgot the key.

373
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:41,541
He should be more careful with your house keys.

374
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,041
Very irresponsible.

375
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:48,583
It could be 5 years or 10.
 Our life together will be waiting for you....

376
00:33:50,791 --> 00:33:52,083
Our small little home...

377
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:55,333
And let me describe it for you...

378
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:57,333
Remember the house we paid and advance for?

379
00:33:57,333 --> 00:33:58,583
Itâ€™s very similar to that one.

380
00:33:58,958 --> 00:34:00,708
A big window in the hall.

381
00:34:01,458 --> 00:34:02,708
And the house is filled with light.

382
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:07,791
I don't mind if its a small house.
 but we should keep it clean.

383
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,666
What is this Putti?

384
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,541
Is this your dream house?

385
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:25,041
The jail was much more nice than this.

386
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:43,208
Since youâ€™ll be the one cooking...

387
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,958
Set up the kitchen however you like.

388
00:34:47,416 --> 00:34:48,333
I don't care.

389
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:51,333
As long as you feed me tasty food on time!

390
00:34:58,208 --> 00:35:00,916
When you enter our bedroom...

391
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,458
It should feel like we're next to the sea...

392
00:35:03,666 --> 00:35:05,833
All the walls painted blue...

393
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,583
You've come very far from the sea.

394
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:13,166
I want a separate wardrobe.
 Donâ€™t you dare come near it!

395
00:35:13,458 --> 00:35:14,291
Do you know why?

396
00:35:14,708 --> 00:35:16,958
When I showed you all the
 cinema tickets that I had collected...

397
00:35:17,208 --> 00:35:18,791
You mocked me so much.

398
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:20,708
You called it â€˜trashâ€™, remember?

399
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,541
Not only cinema tickets...

400
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:26,333
Iâ€™ve collected all our memories in a box.

401
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:34,458
And when I miss you a lot,
 I open that box and go back in time.

402
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,458
Once you get out...

403
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:41,458
Just like that box,
 our house will be filled with memories.

404
00:35:42,166 --> 00:35:44,333
So be ready to live life with all our â€˜trashâ€™.

405
00:35:44,541 --> 00:35:45,166
Idiot...

406
00:35:46,583 --> 00:35:48,208
Why did you do this Manu?!

407
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,916
Do I still have a small place
 amidst all your trash Putti?

408
00:36:24,666 --> 00:36:26,666
After marriage, you will be doing the dishes right?

409
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:27,916
So start practicing now.

410
00:36:28,833 --> 00:36:30,791
Wash it properly, it should shine.

411
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,833
Wait till we get married!

412
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:41,958
I thought of giving this to you
 but now I wonâ€™t.

413
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:49,458
You said Iâ€™ll get one in the evening!

414
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:51,208
Donâ€™t be so stubborn Puneeth.

415
00:36:51,708 --> 00:36:54,083
Chocolate, please Amma?

416
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,708
Donâ€™t do this everyday!

417
00:37:02,291 --> 00:37:05,333
Iâ€™ll come in only if you give me my chocolate.

418
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:07,166
Puneeth!

419
00:37:07,583 --> 00:37:09,083
Take this, but this is the last one.

420
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:20,833
At least, you can teach a child!

421
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,541
Hey?

422
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:36,708
Hey! Stop!

423
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:51,958
Stop!

424
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:57,083
Who do you think you are?

425
00:38:03,458 --> 00:38:04,416
Manu Anna?

426
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:11,083
It's been five months since I got out.

427
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:13,583
Manu Anna...

428
00:38:15,916 --> 00:38:16,458
Anna...

429
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:22,208
I remember how you used to get me chocolates.

430
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,416
I hate sweets now.

431
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:28,458
Good that I didn't get any this time.

432
00:38:33,458 --> 00:38:33,958
Priya?

433
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,083
My sister is doing fine.

434
00:38:37,666 --> 00:38:38,458
My brother-in-law is also doing well.

435
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:43,833
They have a 7 year old son

436
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:46,708
They are happy.

437
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:48,208
Brother-in-law is a good man.

438
00:38:50,333 --> 00:38:52,083
You will not find a single bad bone in him.

439
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,333
Where are you?

440
00:38:56,708 --> 00:38:57,458
Iâ€™ve bought the alcohol.

441
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,916
What do you mean you canâ€™t come?!

442
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,041
Why didnâ€™t you tell me earlier?

443
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:04,166
Go to hell!

444
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:11,958
Hey?

445
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:12,541
Sir?

446
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:13,541
Get me some water...

447
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,166
One minute Sir... Iâ€™ll fill it up.

448
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,458
Thatâ€™s how it is here...

449
00:39:16,583 --> 00:39:18,583
You have to get it yourself.

450
00:39:19,083 --> 00:39:20,458
What next? Theyâ€™ll expect us to cook too.

451
00:39:25,333 --> 00:39:27,041
I thought they wouldâ€™ve
 lived in a nicer house.

452
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:28,458
They did, earlier.

453
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,208
But...

454
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,458
Then what happened?

455
00:39:34,708 --> 00:39:36,208
Tell me what happened, please?

456
00:39:38,583 --> 00:39:39,458
Look Vinodha...

457
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,916
I am not looking to cause any trouble.

458
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:45,583
What happened? Tell me...

459
00:39:46,541 --> 00:39:48,291
The usual scene with businesses

460
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:49,708
The ups and downs.

461
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:52,083
Brother-in-lawâ€™s hotel business
 was doing really well.

462
00:39:52,791 --> 00:39:53,916
He had also opened two more branches...

463
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:55,791
...But this horrible Covid came...

464
00:39:57,041 --> 00:39:58,791
Now Iâ€™m just running only
 the first hotel I owned.

465
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:03,583
The hotel is there, but
 there isnâ€™t any business.

466
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:08,208
What about you, Sir?

467
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,833
It looks like you repair people.

468
00:40:14,833 --> 00:40:18,666
These scars are from the mistakes I made...
 when I was young and dumb.

469
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,333
Heâ€™s seen a lot of hardship.

470
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,083
Heâ€™s a positive man...

471
00:40:24,583 --> 00:40:25,458
Extremely hard working.

472
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:28,041
Hey! Give me another large.

473
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:28,791
Coming sir.

474
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,583
Whatâ€™s the point of working hard in life?

475
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:31,958
Correct sir.

476
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,208
Nothing makes sense.

477
00:40:34,916 --> 00:40:36,041
This is the only truth.

478
00:40:41,708 --> 00:40:42,458
How is Priya?

479
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:43,541
Sheâ€™s fine...

480
00:40:45,833 --> 00:40:46,833
Your...

481
00:40:48,083 --> 00:40:48,708
I mean...

482
00:40:50,083 --> 00:40:51,333
In the early days of marriage...

483
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:53,708
...She took her time.

484
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,083
Then everything became all right.

485
00:40:55,541 --> 00:40:57,541
After the child was born, they are very happy

486
00:40:57,833 --> 00:40:59,083
Does she still sing?

487
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:00,833
Sing?

488
00:41:15,083 --> 00:41:15,708
What I mean is...

489
00:41:16,583 --> 00:41:17,833
...she seemed to have lost her voice.

490
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:19,083
That was the last time.

491
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,166
I havenâ€™t seen her sing since then.

492
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:26,083
She hasnâ€™t sung even for her son.

493
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,833
Her job, home, son, brother-in-law...

494
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:33,833
She, herself, has forgotten that she used to sing.

495
00:41:48,208 --> 00:41:49,708
Are you married, sir?

496
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:55,333
If these women start to quarrel...

497
00:41:56,333 --> 00:41:57,458
... itâ€™s like those shows on TV.

498
00:41:57,833 --> 00:41:58,833
Those soap operas...

499
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:00,958
They go on non stop...

500
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:04,458
At least, you can mute the TV.

501
00:42:12,208 --> 00:42:13,958
I get why you want to see my sister...

502
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,416
But donâ€™t come there anymore.

503
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:17,333
Okay

504
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:19,708
Do you need change?

505
00:42:20,166 --> 00:42:20,458
No

506
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:22,708
This is my friend, Prakasha.

507
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,083
This is Vinodha

508
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:25,791
Hi...

509
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:27,333
Priyaâ€™s brother.

510
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:29,708
It was good to see you.

511
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:32,208
Iâ€™ll make a move

512
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:37,166
I have some work. I forgot.
 Iâ€™ll see you later.

513
00:42:38,208 --> 00:42:39,958
And donâ€™t introduce me as your friend.

514
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:46,791
Patil sir..

515
00:42:48,458 --> 00:42:49,958
Did you understand all that I told you, sir?

516
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:52,208
These are the secrets of marriage, remember!

517
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,833
Iâ€™ll see you sir. Bye. Good night.

518
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:03,416
Here, take this.

519
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,416
Sister, where is the emergency ward?

520
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,291
Go straight and take a right.

521
00:44:18,291 --> 00:44:18,958
Letâ€™s go?

522
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:20,833
Why?

523
00:44:22,708 --> 00:44:24,583
You were stubborn about seeing her.

524
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:26,333
See her now.

525
00:44:27,208 --> 00:44:28,458
Go watch her cry....

526
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,208
I donâ€™t know how to make you understand.

527
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,791
Your story is over.
 You will never be with her again!

528
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:39,833
Itâ€™s been 3874 days since she got married.

529
00:44:41,458 --> 00:44:44,291
Memories of her haunt me day and night.

530
00:44:45,041 --> 00:44:46,958
So I don't need you to remind
 me that our story is over!

531
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,458
-Then why do you...
 -Then why do I what?

532
00:44:52,041 --> 00:44:53,166
I wanted to go live by the sea.

533
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,166
I went to see her one last time before I left.

534
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,833
I had hoped that she was happy with her family.

535
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,083
But her life is anything but that.

536
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,291
Before... when she was in a good mood or
 if she felt a bit of joy...

537
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,333
... she would unknowingly sing.

538
00:45:16,041 --> 00:45:17,416
Now she has just stopped singing!

539
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:20,583
And you expect me to keep
 quiet knowing this?

540
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,083
You donâ€™t understand anything!

541
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:26,833
Thereâ€™s no problem.

542
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,583
He needs to be kept under observation.

543
00:45:28,833 --> 00:45:30,708
Donâ€™t worry, you can take him today itself.

544
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:31,583
Thank you doctor.

545
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:32,458
Okay.

546
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:42,583
Beating up her husband wonâ€™t make her sing.

547
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:48,791
You were supposed to be a big singer Putti.

548
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:52,791
Canâ€™t you sing without me?

549
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:13,458
â€œThe cadence of the cool breezeâ€

550
00:46:13,708 --> 00:46:23,083
â€œThe romance of the whisperâ€

551
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:28,041
â€œI'm a peacock dancing on the cloudsâ€

552
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:33,041
â€œAren't you the beat to my steps?â€

553
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:38,166
â€œThe sweet voice in my mind all alongâ€

554
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:45,666
â€œAren't you the melody to my song?â€

555
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:56,708
â€œMy love! You are the sea to my riverâ€

556
00:46:56,833 --> 00:47:09,583
â€œMy love! I'll enshrine my life in yoursâ€

557
00:47:11,458 --> 00:47:20,291
â€œI'll be a thousand words to your silent gazeâ€

558
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:30,083
â€œI'll be the gushing joy in the gleam of your eyes.â€

559
00:47:31,458 --> 00:47:40,708
â€œYou are the wings to my soaring zealâ€

560
00:47:41,416 --> 00:47:51,208
â€œYou're the sweet essence of all that I feelâ€

561
00:47:53,166 --> 00:47:55,041
I used to sing for my happiness before...

562
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,291
I donâ€™t know when that changed...

563
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,666
Now I feel like singing for you.

564
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:24,833
Sir, what can I get you?

565
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:26,583
A coffee and tea.

566
00:48:26,791 --> 00:48:27,416
Thatâ€™s all?

567
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:28,166
Just a minute.

568
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,333
Less sugar in the tea.

569
00:48:30,458 --> 00:48:30,958
Ok sir.

570
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:38,833
Youâ€™ve lost weight.

571
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,916
Are you not eating well?

572
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:49,708
All well with you?

573
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:51,291
Yes.

574
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:53,083
You?

575
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:55,958
Iâ€™m awesome.

576
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:10,708
Here you go sir.

577
00:49:32,708 --> 00:49:33,458
Wife?

578
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:34,583
Kids?

579
00:49:36,916 --> 00:49:37,916
Just one wife!

580
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:43,083
idiot!

581
00:49:44,541 --> 00:49:45,416
And her name?

582
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:46,958
Surabhi.

583
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:53,083
What about you?

584
00:49:53,708 --> 00:49:54,791
How many kids?

585
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:57,833
One son.

586
00:49:58,791 --> 00:49:59,791
One son, Puneeth.

587
00:50:01,708 --> 00:50:03,208
My husbandâ€™s name is Deepak.

588
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:14,958
I hope youâ€™re happy.

589
00:50:17,041 --> 00:50:17,666
Yes.

590
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:19,333
Very happy!

591
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:21,208
What about you?

592
00:50:25,416 --> 00:50:26,166
Very happy!

593
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:31,666
Do you still sing?

594
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:36,583
Yesâ€¦

595
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:48,791
Iâ€™m so happy to see you!

596
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:55,458
Me too.

597
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:00,583
Iâ€™ll leave now.

598
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:02,958
My son will be waiting.

599
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,208
Manu...

600
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,708
Letâ€™s not meet ever again. Okay?

601
00:51:49,708 --> 00:51:52,083
...Now I sing for you

602
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:55,083
I used to sing for my happiness

603
00:51:55,708 --> 00:51:57,458
I donâ€™t know when it changed.

604
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:00,916
I used to sing for my happiness

605
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,458
Donâ€™t know when it changed.

606
00:53:09,583 --> 00:53:10,958
Puneeth! Are you ready?

607
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:15,791
Wow! Sajjige!

608
00:53:17,291 --> 00:53:18,291
Something special today?

609
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,458
Yeah!

610
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:22,083
So what is the occasion?
 Is it your birthday?

611
00:53:22,791 --> 00:53:25,916
I don't know, my birthday
 is on October 6.

612
00:53:26,333 --> 00:53:30,208
And amma has promised
 to buy me a cycle.

613
00:53:33,041 --> 00:53:34,708
Will you take me on your cycle?

614
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:37,916
If you sit on my cycle, it will break.

615
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,833
So will you eat it all alone?
 Wonâ€™t you share with me?

616
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:48,083
No.

617
00:53:57,208 --> 00:54:00,333
Here, have some.
 My mother makes it well.

618
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,041
Enough! Give it back.

619
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:42,583
Surabhi!

620
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,333
You forgot to take money.

621
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,083
Iâ€™ll call you.

622
00:55:37,416 --> 00:55:40,916
It is used by a woman.
 She shouldnâ€™t have any problem starting it.

623
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:26,083
Give this to Priya.

624
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:28,958
Anna, I told you the other day itself ...

625
00:56:29,291 --> 00:56:30,666
... to stay away from my sister.

626
00:56:30,833 --> 00:56:31,458
I know.

627
00:56:33,583 --> 00:56:34,583
Donâ€™t tell her it's from me.

628
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:36,833
You know...

629
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,083
...how fond of music she was..

630
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:43,791
Take it.

631
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:50,708
I promise to keep out of her way.

632
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:57,208
Sir always keeps his promises.

633
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:03,458
Please reduce the volume.

634
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,083
Give me that box.

635
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:10,791
Whatâ€™s this?

636
00:57:10,916 --> 00:57:11,666
A gift.

637
00:57:12,541 --> 00:57:13,666
Gift and you?

638
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,083
Someone must have
 left it behind in your auto.

639
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:18,083
You are very arrogant.

640
00:57:19,458 --> 00:57:23,708
Everyone is listening to music,
 why arenâ€™t you Putti?

641
00:57:25,791 --> 00:57:26,708
How are you feeling now?

642
00:57:26,791 --> 00:57:27,916
Better sir.

643
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:29,833
Had you not come on timeâ€¦ thank you.

644
00:57:30,333 --> 00:57:31,208
Thank you sir.

645
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:32,708
Who hit you?

646
00:57:32,958 --> 00:57:35,458
I have no clue. Some b*****d for sure!

647
00:57:35,958 --> 00:57:37,583
If I catch hold of him...

648
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,583
Anyway, forget it.

649
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,166
Go on, order. Itâ€™s on me today.

650
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,833
Even the other day, you paid the bill.

651
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:46,166
I feel like eating fish fry.

652
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:48,083
Not here sir. Itâ€™s awful.

653
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:49,791
Iâ€™ll take you to another hotel.

654
00:57:50,083 --> 00:57:52,208
The taste of fish fry there is ...

655
00:57:52,708 --> 00:57:53,458
... sir...

656
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:57,958
Give me a moment, sir.

657
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:24,833
What happened?

658
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:26,958
Why the long face?

659
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:30,708
Amma said she wonâ€™t buy
 me the cycle this year too.

660
00:59:30,958 --> 00:59:32,958
Then what did she gift
 you on your birthday?

661
00:59:33,166 --> 00:59:35,208
I got a good thrashing.

662
00:59:37,041 --> 00:59:38,166
Why?

663
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:40,166
Because I asked for a cycle.

664
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:42,458
Did she fall short of money?

665
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,166
Yes, I think my father took it all.

666
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:48,208
My parents were having a major fight.

667
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:53,958
So shall I gift you a cycle?

668
00:59:54,166 --> 00:59:56,791
No. I want to buy it with my money.

669
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:00,791
Okay, come here.

670
01:00:00,916 --> 01:00:02,541
Cheer up.

671
01:00:04,458 --> 01:00:05,583
Sit.

672
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:12,708
Take this.

673
01:00:13,833 --> 01:00:14,958
What is this?

674
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:19,208
You can use this to go on all these rides.

675
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:20,291
No thanks.

676
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:21,291
Why?

677
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:24,791
Amma knows all my friends.

678
01:00:25,166 --> 01:00:29,041
But she doesnâ€™t know you. If I
 come with you, sheâ€™ll shout at me.

679
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:32,833
Not with me. You go
 with your appa and amma.

680
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:40,416
Thereâ€™s a roller coaster
 and a giant wheel too!

681
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,291
Someone is doing charity during Covid.

682
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:46,208
Itâ€™s been long since we went out too. Letâ€™s go.

683
01:00:55,708 --> 01:00:57,208
What are we doing here?

684
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,541
The tickets to the graveyard
 were sold out. So here we are.

685
01:01:03,583 --> 01:01:04,083
Loafer.

686
01:01:08,083 --> 01:01:10,041
2 tickets? Okay

687
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:16,708
Letâ€™s go fast?

688
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,208
Iâ€™ll come back in a minute.

689
01:01:19,916 --> 01:01:21,416
Come, letâ€™s sit here.

690
01:01:22,333 --> 01:01:24,166
Dashing cars was fun no?

691
01:01:34,666 --> 01:01:36,458
Everyoneâ€™s so happy!

692
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:42,666
Makes you wonder what both of us
 are doing in a happy place like this...

693
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:49,208
Nothing of that sort.
 Iâ€™m always happy.

694
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:51,791
I don't ever feel sad

695
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:53,291
Is that so?

696
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:55,333
I donâ€™t feel pain.

697
01:01:58,666 --> 01:01:59,208
Loafer.

698
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:00,083
Didnâ€™t you just say you donâ€™t feel pain?

699
01:02:00,208 --> 01:02:02,083
So why would you do something like that!

700
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:06,208
A horse! I want to ride on it!

701
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:07,833
Donâ€™t run! Puneeth!

702
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:24,458
When I was young, somebody close
 to me broke my heart into pieces...

703
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:28,083
And I didnâ€™t bother to piece it back together.

704
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:31,791
Iâ€™ve collected all those pieces
 and have given it away to many people

705
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,666
But I havenâ€™t given away a piece that
 is large enough for anyone to hurt me.

706
01:02:39,083 --> 01:02:40,458
So which piece have you given me?

707
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:48,833
Here....take.

708
01:02:48,958 --> 01:02:51,083
Oof! Itâ€™s so heavy!

709
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:54,166
Oh no...

710
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,583
Itâ€™s okay, leave it.

711
01:03:13,333 --> 01:03:13,958
One second...

712
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:14,833
One more...

713
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,083
Hello?

714
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:17,333
Sir, this is Deepak.

715
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:20,041
I had a missed call from you. Whatâ€™s up?

716
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:22,458
Whose number is this?

717
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:25,458
My phone is switched off. Iâ€™m
 calling from a friendâ€™s phone.

718
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:27,333
I thought of catching up with you.

719
01:03:29,041 --> 01:03:32,083
Sir, Iâ€™m out out with family.
 Iâ€™ll meet you next week.

720
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:35,791
Okay.

721
01:03:42,291 --> 01:03:43,250
Whose number is this?

722
01:03:43,291 --> 01:03:44,541
Iâ€™m calling from a friendâ€™s phone.

723
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:45,333
Hello?

724
01:03:45,583 --> 01:03:48,708
Hello. Lotus Massage Parlour.
 How can I help you?

725
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:50,708
Hello?

726
01:03:52,166 --> 01:03:53,041
Hello Sir?

727
01:04:07,833 --> 01:04:08,666
Surabhi?

728
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:09,541
Yes?

729
01:04:11,291 --> 01:04:12,291
I need your help.

730
01:04:12,708 --> 01:04:13,708
Come here.

731
01:04:18,833 --> 01:04:22,958
I think this should fit you.
 If not, we can exchange it. Try it.

732
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:25,666
It's a small tear. Such a waste of money.

733
01:04:33,083 --> 01:04:35,333
Now there's a big tear and worth the money.

734
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:53,291
Looks awesome on you.

735
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:57,583
If I stand at the circle theyâ€™ll
 mistake me for a traffic signal.

736
01:04:58,166 --> 01:04:59,916
This is what suits you.

737
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,041
Itâ€™s nice.

738
01:05:04,583 --> 01:05:06,958
So what favour do you want?

739
01:05:09,583 --> 01:05:11,458
Not a favour. I need a job to be done.

740
01:05:12,666 --> 01:05:14,416
If itâ€™s about that pretty princess â€¦

741
01:05:18,041 --> 01:05:20,583
I am about to do some business with a guy...

742
01:05:21,666 --> 01:05:23,416
He keeps going to a massage parlour.

743
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:25,416
Can you check what heâ€™s upto?

744
01:06:15,458 --> 01:06:18,083
Hello, what happened?

745
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,708
Heâ€™s not that type.

746
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:21,666
Are you sure? Did you check properly?

747
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:22,541
What do you mean verify?

748
01:06:22,708 --> 01:06:24,333
Should I have stripped in front him?

749
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,708
And asked if he wants to fondle me?

750
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:26,333
Tell me?

751
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:28,083
Thatâ€™s not what I meantâ€¦

752
01:06:28,208 --> 01:06:29,833
Didnâ€™t I tell you heâ€™s not that type!

753
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:32,958
What are you staring at?

754
01:06:33,166 --> 01:06:34,416
Is it because I said Iâ€™d strip?

755
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:35,833
Come, Iâ€™ll do that.

756
01:06:36,041 --> 01:06:38,458
Just 1000 bucks! Iâ€™ll give you a discount, too!

757
01:07:04,833 --> 01:07:06,041
Hey Surabhi.

758
01:07:06,291 --> 01:07:07,916
Get a grip over your mood.

759
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:08,708
Got it?

760
01:07:09,416 --> 01:07:14,458
Customers are complaining.
 Go get another job if you cant stop.

761
01:07:38,541 --> 01:07:40,916
Who are you?

762
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:42,583
Where is Deepak?

763
01:07:44,083 --> 01:07:46,083
He is not at home, come later.

764
01:07:46,541 --> 01:07:47,541
Open the door!

765
01:07:47,666 --> 01:07:48,041
Open it!

766
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:50,333
Go away. I told you he is not here.

767
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:52,083
Please donâ€™t come inside.

768
01:07:57,583 --> 01:08:00,708
If he doesnâ€™t pay up by next month,
 we wonâ€™t let him go.

769
01:08:01,041 --> 01:08:02,833
This is the last warning.

770
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:32,666
Three fish meals

771
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:33,625
Rs 250/-

772
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:43,625
Do you want soda, sir?
 Itâ€™s in the cooler.

773
01:09:43,916 --> 01:09:44,500
Iâ€™m good.

774
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:46,500
Itâ€™s dirty around here. Iâ€™m short staffed.

775
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:48,166
Itâ€™s okay. Sit down.

776
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:51,625
The promised fish fry is here.

777
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:09,541
What sir?

778
01:10:09,791 --> 01:10:13,250
Are you wondering why
 I have ordered fish from another hotel?

779
01:10:21,625 --> 01:10:22,875
You read my mind.

780
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:26,875
Please eat.

781
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:32,041
Itâ€™s my friendâ€™s hotel.
 We started the business together.

782
01:10:32,666 --> 01:10:34,416
You should go there during lunch hour.

783
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:35,916
Itâ€™s tough to get a table!

784
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,250
Before Covid...

785
01:10:39,250 --> 01:10:40,916
...my hotel was like that too.

786
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:45,166
People would come searching for fish meals here.

787
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:51,125
After Covid, his business got back to normal.

788
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:56,875
You know what I miss the most sir?

789
01:10:57,541 --> 01:10:58,291
The sound...

790
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,125
When a hotel is thriving,
 there is a certain sound.

791
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:05,666
The banter in the kitchen...

792
01:11:06,041 --> 01:11:07,500
The cooker whistling...

793
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,791
Customersâ€™ chatter...

794
01:11:16,875 --> 01:11:21,041
But now, everything is silent.

795
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:33,541
Even if I donâ€™t want to, I see his hotel everyday

796
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:37,000
I donâ€™t feel jealous of him, sir.

797
01:11:38,875 --> 01:11:40,125
Heâ€™s a nice guy.

798
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:42,166
But...

799
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:45,041
... I crave the life he has.

800
01:11:46,416 --> 01:11:50,000
His wife and child are so happy!

801
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:53,416
I am unable to provide that happiness to my family.

802
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,625
I dont why I was picked for this misfortune.

803
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:00,791
I used to believe that we have the
 capacity to write our own destiny.

804
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:02,166
But no, sir.

805
01:12:03,541 --> 01:12:05,916
When you see your failure every passing minute...

806
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:09,041
... how can one find the strength to win?

807
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,791
Close this hotel and open another one.

808
01:12:13,791 --> 01:12:15,125
Itâ€™s easier said than done sir.

809
01:12:15,166 --> 01:12:16,791
I have to repay a loan of Rs 75 lakhs.

810
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,250
Our life has deteriorated completely from before...

811
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,750
I feel sad for my wife.

812
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,166
I've put her through a lot.

813
01:12:23,666 --> 01:12:26,541
Sometimes, I feel like just ending my life.

814
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:29,416
It's just back luck sir.

815
01:12:31,166 --> 01:12:32,916
Luck is for those who look for short cuts.

816
01:12:33,125 --> 01:12:34,416
Not for the ones who work hard.

817
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:37,000
All will be well. Just wait and watch.

818
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:38,791
Come, letâ€™s have our drink.

819
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:43,041
Sorry sir.

820
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:45,041
Cheers.

821
01:12:45,375 --> 01:12:46,125
Cheers.

822
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:50,500
Sorry!

823
01:12:50,625 --> 01:12:51,916
Iâ€™ll get another glass.

824
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:06,916
To repay her debt...

825
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:10,541
Iâ€™ll have to work another 80 years

826
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,125
Nothing has changed.

827
01:13:20,291 --> 01:13:22,791
Iâ€™m exactly where I was
 when we started out.

828
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:30,791
The debtors will not let go of her husband.

829
01:13:31,916 --> 01:13:34,500
She will not let go of him
 and you will not let go of her.

830
01:13:35,541 --> 01:13:37,291
And I will never give up on you.

831
01:13:42,791 --> 01:13:43,791
Manu?

832
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:47,875
Why donâ€™t we commit theft,
 repay his loans

833
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,250
... and go back to jail?

834
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:54,625
Even Iâ€™m tired of
 driving this cab.

835
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:03,666
The first time you went to jail
 was for money, wasnâ€™t it?

836
01:14:03,791 --> 01:14:05,791
But you ended up getting stabbed in the back.

837
01:14:07,041 --> 01:14:09,250
Now letâ€™s get the money
 and go back to jail.

838
01:14:34,666 --> 01:14:35,875
Good morning sir.

839
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,791
Good morning madam.

840
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:41,125
Madam?

841
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:41,416
Sir!.. Sir?

842
01:14:42,041 --> 01:14:42,916
Who are you?

843
01:14:43,541 --> 01:14:44,416
Madam?

844
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:45,291
Itâ€™s me Manu!

845
01:14:46,291 --> 01:14:47,291
Sir, I used to work here before.

846
01:14:47,291 --> 01:14:48,541
You need an appointment to go in.

847
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,291
Madam, it's me Manu.

848
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,791
Madam, two minutes...?

849
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,750
Madam!

850
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:54,625
Madam!

851
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,166
Madam! Listen to me...

852
01:14:58,541 --> 01:14:59,166
Come with us sir.

853
01:14:59,500 --> 01:14:59,916
Madam!

854
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:03,166
I hear you, but thereâ€™s a
 procedure we follow.

855
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:05,916
Just because you worked here
 before, you canâ€™t just barge in.

856
01:15:06,625 --> 01:15:08,541
Yes sir, heâ€™s here in the lobby.

857
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,625
His name is Manu, sir.

858
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:17,916
Manu?

859
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:19,750
I donâ€™t know anyone by that name

860
01:15:19,791 --> 01:15:20,791
Send him out.

861
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:24,416
Take him away.

862
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:25,250
Come sir.

863
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:26,125
One minute sir...

864
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:27,166
... Please let me speak to him sir.

865
01:15:27,416 --> 01:15:27,750
Sir?

866
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:28,166
Sir?

867
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:29,375
Take him away quickly!

868
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:29,666
Sir?

869
01:15:48,375 --> 01:15:50,000
Oh gosh!

870
01:15:50,375 --> 01:15:50,875
Preethu...

871
01:15:54,291 --> 01:15:54,750
Come here...

872
01:16:02,666 --> 01:16:05,625
Itâ€™s very expensive one.
 Donâ€™t bother us again.

873
01:16:21,791 --> 01:16:24,166
Thatâ€™s their compensation for
 the ten years I sacrificed!

874
01:16:24,375 --> 01:16:26,041
B*****ds

875
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:29,875
We'll do something
 about this, don't worry.

876
01:16:31,791 --> 01:16:33,750
Iâ€™ve spoken to the owner.

877
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,291
Heâ€™s promised to give us a good price.
 Donâ€™t worry.

878
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:42,666
Manu, come with me.

879
01:16:43,291 --> 01:16:43,916
What happened?

880
01:16:44,041 --> 01:16:45,291
You come with me, Iâ€™ll tell you

881
01:16:45,416 --> 01:16:46,791
Manu!

882
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:49,166
Manu, listen to me...

883
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,291
How are you Manu?

884
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,666
When did you get out?

885
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,291
Letâ€™s go...

886
01:16:59,666 --> 01:17:00,041
Letâ€™s go!

887
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:03,041
Wait man! Itâ€™s been so
 many years since I met him!

888
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:05,541
You look like a jamun now!

889
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:06,500
Shut up!

890
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:09,541
You know what Sunila?

891
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:13,375
I completely forgot to take revenge on this guy.

892
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,625
But thatâ€™s how the real world is!

893
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
What brings you here?

894
01:17:22,791 --> 01:17:24,625
Ah! To ask for a loan perhaps?

895
01:17:25,166 --> 01:17:27,166
Iâ€™ll give you a for a lower interest .

896
01:17:27,250 --> 01:17:27,416
Come!

897
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,500
How much do you want, Manu?

898
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,666
Don't you want it? Just ask, donâ€™t be shy!

899
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:31,750
Manu!

900
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,750
Will I say no to you, Manu?

901
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:37,125
Manu, letâ€™s go. Iâ€™ll figure it out.

902
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:06,875
Hello.

903
01:18:07,875 --> 01:18:09,041
The job is done.

904
01:18:12,625 --> 01:18:13,875
Where should I come?

905
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:21,000
Wah! What a great arrangement!

906
01:18:23,250 --> 01:18:25,875
If someone finds out, theyâ€™ll
 beat you black and blue...

907
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,791
And Iâ€™ll be part of that package deal.

908
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,250
All good? You counted 8 lakhs?

909
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:36,500
You obviously cannot go give the money to them.

910
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:40,291
So who is coming from Dubai for â€˜thisâ€™ deal?

911
01:18:44,875 --> 01:18:46,041
Guru!!

912
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:47,541
No way!

913
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:49,416
Absolutely not!

914
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:51,875
I donâ€™t want to go back to jail!

915
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:53,541
I've had enough of you.

916
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,750
I made a mistake not whacking you the first time.

917
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:09,416
Have you no shame?

918
01:19:09,416 --> 01:19:09,875
Vinodha...

919
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,875
Have you forgotten the ruckus those
 from the other day?

920
01:19:17,041 --> 01:19:19,541
You're well aware of the loans and the interest.

921
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:23,875
Iâ€™ll stay behind the scenes.
 Prakasha will be the frontman.

922
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,166
Yeah. Yeah. Prakasha will be there.

923
01:19:34,541 --> 01:19:37,375
You think itâ€™s easy to start a new hotel?

924
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Youâ€™ve seen whatâ€™s happened before.

925
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:44,250
Letâ€™s not let a bad experience
 come in the way of business.

926
01:19:45,916 --> 01:19:47,916
Donâ€™t talk about our
 family matters outside!

927
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,166
This is not a family matter.

928
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,250
Itâ€™s about business.

929
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,291
You are not even listening
 to what I have to say.

930
01:19:54,291 --> 01:19:56,250
Iâ€™m listening uncle.

931
01:19:57,416 --> 01:19:58,250
Youâ€™re a clever boy!

932
01:19:58,666 --> 01:20:00,166
How do you know they are ok people?

933
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:01,500
I know they are....

934
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,541
Else I wouldnâ€™t have
 brought this up.

935
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:06,000
My friend Manoj, his brother.

936
01:20:06,791 --> 01:20:07,625
He is a good man.

937
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:12,041
So we will be working under
 him because heâ€™s funding us.

938
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,416
Not at all.

939
01:20:13,666 --> 01:20:15,625
It wonâ€™t be like that. Heâ€™s from Dubai.

940
01:20:16,416 --> 01:20:17,250
Very good people

941
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:20,916
He will only invest. You
 will be running the show.

942
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:23,541
He will take a share in the profits

943
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,750
You speak to him about the details.

944
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:28,291
Please just meet him once.

945
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,791
If youâ€™re uncomfortable
 after that, weâ€™ll drop it.

946
01:20:34,166 --> 01:20:34,541
Appa!

947
01:20:35,291 --> 01:20:36,666
Amma says Okay.

948
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:43,375
When will they come?

949
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:44,666
We have to go and meet him.

950
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:46,041
To Dubai?

951
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:48,041
No, Mangaluru.

952
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,041
To Mangaluru?

953
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:02,500
Manu?

954
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,666
Manu? Please listen to me.

955
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,291
Try and understand.
 This is really difficult.

956
01:21:08,791 --> 01:21:10,750
We still have time. Letâ€™s go back.

957
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:16,125
You were ready to commit robbery
 for my sake the other day.

958
01:21:17,041 --> 01:21:18,500
This is nothing compared to that.

959
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,125
Get ready.
 Theyâ€™ll be here any moment.

960
01:21:25,791 --> 01:21:26,541
Iâ€™ll be upstairs.

961
01:21:30,166 --> 01:21:32,791
I said that as a joke.
 How can you take it seriously!

962
01:21:39,291 --> 01:21:39,916
Yes...

963
01:21:41,541 --> 01:21:42,250
Yes...

964
01:21:42,791 --> 01:21:43,291
Sir?

965
01:21:43,416 --> 01:21:44,041
Yes...

966
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:47,750
My brother-in-law.

967
01:21:48,416 --> 01:21:49,041
This is Prakash.

968
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:49,875
Deepak.

969
01:21:49,916 --> 01:21:50,541
Prakash.

970
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:52,500
Please sit.

971
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,125
Hmmm ... 2 years

972
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:07,291
Okay

973
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:09,666
Okay

974
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:11,791
Okay. Iâ€™m fine with all your terms.

975
01:22:13,375 --> 01:22:16,875
This is the advance.

976
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:20,916
Your hotel should run well.

977
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:21,791
It will, sir.

978
01:22:22,666 --> 01:22:23,541
Letâ€™s sign the agreement.

979
01:22:23,541 --> 01:22:23,875
Okay sir.

980
01:22:25,875 --> 01:22:29,375
I will pay the balance once you start work.

981
01:22:29,875 --> 01:22:30,291
Okay sir.

982
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:31,416
In 2 months.

983
01:22:31,791 --> 01:22:32,916
Letâ€™s hope for good things.

984
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,750
â€œOh Earthâ€

985
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:12,625
â€œThe shelter you've givenâ€

986
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:21,625
â€œUnveil the screen of memoryâ€

987
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:31,666
â€œHas the distant sea called the shoreâ€

988
01:23:32,875 --> 01:23:41,375
â€œHave the waves shown the way to soarâ€

989
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:46,041
â€œHow did the mind clear up, can you tell?â€

990
01:23:46,041 --> 01:23:50,625
â€œAs the Ganga flowed down heaven's stairwellâ€

991
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:59,166
â€œHow did I wait to bid you farewell?â€

992
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:56,625
Sorry. I hurt you a lot.

993
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:00,875
Not a â€˜lotâ€™

994
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:04,416
As much as a mosquito bite?

995
01:25:06,666 --> 01:25:08,416
No. More than that.

996
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:16,541
If I can give you pleasure,
 I can also give you pain

997
01:25:54,666 --> 01:25:56,166
Wait a minute, Sunila.

998
01:25:57,375 --> 01:25:57,791
What is it?

999
01:25:57,875 --> 01:25:59,625
I got his number. Iâ€™ve sent it to you.

1000
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:04,416
Okay go!

1001
01:26:05,125 --> 01:26:06,625
Shall I go and give him a scare.

1002
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:16,791
Get lost!

1003
01:26:17,625 --> 01:26:18,541
Letâ€™s go.

1004
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:29,625
Helloâ€¦?

1005
01:26:29,625 --> 01:26:36,416
(singing a romantic song)

1006
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,250
Manu...

1007
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:40,375
Seeing you after so many years...

1008
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:43,125
... has set my heart aflutter!

1009
01:26:45,541 --> 01:26:47,625
You and I are like that TV show...

1010
01:26:47,625 --> 01:26:49,750
Just like Tom and Jerry.

1011
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:53,125
Hello?

1012
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,000
Hello?

1013
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:00,125
I didnâ€™t even say anything

1014
01:27:01,375 --> 01:27:03,375
I guess you must have
 forgotten your hearing aid.

1015
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,000
Do you want me to be louder?

1016
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,916
Can you hear me? Hello?

1017
01:27:09,291 --> 01:27:10,041
Hello?

1018
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:15,875
Increase the volume

1019
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:02,375
Do we take him now?

1020
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:04,125
Not today.

1021
01:29:08,375 --> 01:29:09,375
Sir!

1022
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:11,375
What was the purpose of your visit?

1023
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:13,375
Iâ€¦

1024
01:29:14,916 --> 01:29:16,041
What?

1025
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:18,125
Do one thing.

1026
01:29:18,291 --> 01:29:20,541
The next time you meet Manu...

1027
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:24,541
... do a striptease and dance for him.

1028
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:31,750
How do you even sit in this at home guys?
 Itâ€™s so uncomfortable.

1029
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:33,625
Whatâ€™s your story now?

1030
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:35,000
Give me another week.

1031
01:29:37,625 --> 01:29:39,541
Itâ€™s okay, take two weeks.

1032
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,041
Take off the mask.

1033
01:29:44,541 --> 01:29:45,916
How old are you?

1034
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:47,125
Nineteen.

1035
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,250
Sheâ€™s quite the looker no?

1036
01:29:58,541 --> 01:29:59,166
Manu...

1037
01:29:59,166 --> 01:29:59,916
Do you have a lighter?

1038
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,291
Soma Anna and I shall go to her house
 to show her some love.

1039
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:28,791
Wait and watch.

1040
01:30:59,750 --> 01:31:02,791
Anna, he had called to say
 he found Manu's girl's house.

1041
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,666
He wanted to show you her house.

1042
01:31:59,041 --> 01:32:00,250
Iâ€™ve told him everything.

1043
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:01,166
Hereâ€™s Rs. 50,000

1044
01:32:01,250 --> 01:32:02,041
Okay.

1045
01:32:08,875 --> 01:32:09,666
Namaste sir.

1046
01:32:10,166 --> 01:32:11,500
Youâ€™ll have to vacate the house.

1047
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,041
Yes, he is right here.

1048
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,625
Okay, alright thanks.

1049
01:32:29,750 --> 01:32:32,000
Sir, let's go there by tomorrow morning at 10.30

1050
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,041
Sir, I wonâ€™t come, but my friend will be there.

1051
01:32:35,166 --> 01:32:35,916
No Problem.

1052
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:41,416
Pack properly, okay?

1053
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:48,625
â€œLive like you should, forsaking a thousand worries and moreâ€

1054
01:32:49,041 --> 01:32:52,791
â€œJust the way the dark cloud lightens after a downpourâ€

1055
01:32:55,750 --> 01:32:58,250
Sir, this is unlike any of the
 houses youâ€™ve seen earlier.

1056
01:32:58,625 --> 01:32:59,250
Come in.

1057
01:33:00,791 --> 01:33:04,166
Itâ€™s exactly like what you said you wanted.

1058
01:33:04,291 --> 01:33:05,166
Let me show you.

1059
01:33:05,291 --> 01:33:06,291
This is the bedroom...

1060
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:07,791
Really good ventilation...

1061
01:33:14,750 --> 01:33:19,750
â€œSweeping aside the stars adorning its wombâ€

1062
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:24,916
See sir, thatâ€™s the kitchen.

1063
01:33:25,291 --> 01:33:26,916
Very good quality woodwork.

1064
01:33:29,250 --> 01:33:30,500
See, thereâ€™s a chimney too.

1065
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:31,916
You will face no problems here.

1066
01:33:32,125 --> 01:33:32,541
Here take...

1067
01:33:33,125 --> 01:33:34,250
Use both your hands.

1068
01:33:36,166 --> 01:33:37,166
What are you doing?

1069
01:33:37,375 --> 01:33:38,250
Homework

1070
01:33:38,541 --> 01:33:39,416
You havenâ€™t filled this.

1071
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:46,916
â€œJust the way as it disappears- the poor night of gloomâ€

1072
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:48,291
Keep at it.

1073
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:53,375
â€œLet my life be, my merciful Lord.â€

1074
01:33:53,541 --> 01:33:57,916
â€œLet my life be, my merciful Lord.â€

1075
01:33:58,666 --> 01:34:03,166
â€œStanding oneself in the hot burning sunâ€

1076
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:07,666
â€œBestowing yet cool shade to everyoneâ€

1077
01:34:08,375 --> 01:34:11,291
â€œStanding oneself in the hot burning sunâ€

1078
01:34:11,291 --> 01:34:13,291
â€œBestowing yet cool shade to everyoneâ€

1079
01:34:13,416 --> 01:34:14,541
This house is the one!!

1080
01:34:14,875 --> 01:34:16,291
I will give the advance right away.

1081
01:34:16,916 --> 01:34:17,875
And...

1082
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:19,916
One of the rooms need to be repainted.

1083
01:34:20,166 --> 01:34:21,541
Okay sir done.

1084
01:34:23,416 --> 01:34:28,250
â€œLet my life be, my loving Lord.â€

1085
01:34:28,291 --> 01:34:33,125
â€œJust the way the beech tree has always doneâ€

1086
01:34:33,125 --> 01:34:37,916
â€œLet my life be, my loving Lord.â€

1087
01:34:38,125 --> 01:34:42,916
â€œLet my life be, my loving Lord.â€

1088
01:34:42,916 --> 01:34:48,000
â€œLive like you should, forsaking a thousand worries and moreâ€

1089
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:56,916
â€œJust the way the dark cloud lightens after a downpour.â€

1090
01:35:21,291 --> 01:35:21,750
Hello?

1091
01:35:22,041 --> 01:35:24,541
Iâ€˜ve arranged a funeral lunch in memory of Kali.

1092
01:35:24,666 --> 01:35:26,541
Would be nice if you could make it.

1093
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:29,375
Bring your girl, too.

1094
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:31,666
Kaliâ€™s last wish was to meet her.

1095
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:34,666
Who was that?

1096
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:35,916
Wrong number

1097
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:41,875
Hey, the bus is leaving, come fast!

1098
01:35:48,916 --> 01:35:50,291
Come live with me.

1099
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:54,541
No.

1100
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:56,750
Surabhi...

1101
01:35:57,666 --> 01:35:58,416
Surabhi!

1102
01:36:05,916 --> 01:36:07,875
Anna, Manuâ€™s here.

1103
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,291
Namaste Officer.

1104
01:36:33,791 --> 01:36:35,416
Give Inspector Sir a leg piece.

1105
01:36:35,875 --> 01:36:37,375
Eat well boys!

1106
01:36:40,750 --> 01:36:43,250
Whatâ€™s up Manu. Youâ€™ve come alone?

1107
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:46,750
If you had got your girl, Kaliâ€™s soul
 would have rested in peace.

1108
01:36:46,916 --> 01:36:48,500
Iâ€™ll organised one mourning ceremony.

1109
01:36:50,916 --> 01:36:52,416
Iâ€™ll bring her to the next one.

1110
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:56,375
Serve me kebab.

1111
01:36:58,916 --> 01:37:00,250
How can I say no to you!

1112
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,166
Iâ€™ll pack some for her too.

1113
01:37:02,291 --> 01:37:04,875
Hey, pack some kebabs.

1114
01:37:10,875 --> 01:37:12,500
Some kebabs for you.

1115
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:29,541
Where is Soma?

1116
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:40,125
I barely hung up the phone
 and youâ€™re here!

1117
01:37:41,125 --> 01:37:43,000
She didnâ€™t even let me party.

1118
01:37:43,291 --> 01:37:44,625
She's got me drunk.

1119
01:37:45,375 --> 01:37:46,250
Not here Soma.

1120
01:37:47,041 --> 01:37:48,291
Letâ€™s go out and talk.

1121
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:06,291
Ah! I can hear now.

1122
01:38:08,291 --> 01:38:10,125
For this mole face?

1123
01:38:10,666 --> 01:38:12,166
Kali

1124
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:14,291
Like I said Manu...

1125
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:17,125
...Tom &amp; Jerry.

1126
01:38:18,041 --> 01:38:19,875
Weâ€™re like lovers.

1127
01:38:21,250 --> 01:38:24,250
Who is Tom? Who is Jerry?
 You decide that.

1128
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:27,291
Mole face...

1129
01:38:27,416 --> 01:38:28,666
You must know Apsara theatre.

1130
01:38:29,250 --> 01:38:30,375
That's mine

1131
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,916
Iâ€™ll treat you to the night show.

1132
01:38:36,666 --> 01:38:38,250
Thatâ€™s to cover both your expenses.

1133
01:38:39,375 --> 01:38:40,250
Bye!

1134
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:45,750
Where the hell is my pant woman?

1135
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,875
Love you Manu.

1136
01:39:16,625 --> 01:39:18,500
Soma and I...

1137
01:39:19,166 --> 01:39:21,291
-Back in prison...
 -I didn't ask

1138
01:39:43,166 --> 01:39:44,041
Come in.

1139
01:39:46,166 --> 01:39:47,125
This is the house.

1140
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:51,125
Our house.

1141
01:39:58,041 --> 01:39:59,375
The kitchenâ€™s this side.

1142
01:40:08,375 --> 01:40:09,375
Itâ€™s nice.

1143
01:40:10,750 --> 01:40:11,750
Itâ€™s a little empty.

1144
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:13,375
A little?

1145
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,291
Itâ€™s okay. Iâ€™ll fill it up.

1146
01:40:30,666 --> 01:40:31,791
Everything will be fine

1147
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,125
How much longer Vinodha?

1148
01:40:33,125 --> 01:40:34,250
If he canâ€™t, ask him to let me know.

1149
01:40:34,375 --> 01:40:36,208
Iâ€™ll speak to him right now.
  Iâ€™ll call you back

1150
01:40:37,166 --> 01:40:38,000
Okay.

1151
01:40:39,125 --> 01:40:40,250
All okay?

1152
01:40:40,541 --> 01:40:43,625
Some money has to be arranged, sir.

1153
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,000
Take the call, sir.

1154
01:40:52,250 --> 01:40:53,166
Not now.

1155
01:40:53,666 --> 01:40:55,000
Both of us share the same problem!

1156
01:40:56,666 --> 01:40:59,875
They have started work on the hotel
 The advance has been used up.

1157
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:01,875
Akka is also really tensed...

1158
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:04,166
Iâ€™ve run out of funds...

1159
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:41,500
What do you want?

1160
01:42:42,541 --> 01:42:44,166
You like chocolate?

1161
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:46,791
Deeksha! Come here!

1162
01:42:47,541 --> 01:42:49,041
Your name is Deeksha?

1163
01:42:49,666 --> 01:42:50,875
Ask your grandma to come sit here.

1164
01:42:56,125 --> 01:42:57,625
This has my bank details.

1165
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:00,291
Give this to your grandma....

1166
01:43:02,625 --> 01:43:04,041
I will be waiting for the bank's notification.

1167
01:43:04,416 --> 01:43:06,041
By the way, Iâ€™ve added interest for the ten years.

1168
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:06,875
Okay.

1169
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,750
Donâ€™t bother us again.

1170
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:14,541
And...

1171
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,375
There was one other thing.

1172
01:43:21,625 --> 01:43:23,625
Ensure that madam and the
 familyâ€™s name is not revealed.

1173
01:43:24,125 --> 01:43:25,375
Rest will be paid after the job.

1174
01:43:25,875 --> 01:43:26,541
Iâ€™ll handle the rest.

1175
01:43:27,125 --> 01:43:29,541
The orders were from above...
 I cant do anything.

1176
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:32,000
You're get paid on time...
 So why all this?

1177
01:43:32,791 --> 01:43:34,250
-Hey Sunila, come here
 -Anna

1178
01:43:34,791 --> 01:43:37,375
Call and tell the lawyer to come
 to the station quickly.

1179
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,375
Okay anna.

1180
01:43:40,375 --> 01:43:42,500
Some big shot is behind this.

1181
01:43:42,666 --> 01:43:44,166
Everybody is tight-lipped.

1182
01:43:44,750 --> 01:43:46,500
Everyoneâ€™s has been bribed.

1183
01:43:47,041 --> 01:43:47,791
But...

1184
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:50,250
Who have you provoked?

1185
01:43:59,416 --> 01:44:02,250
You start arranging for the bail.
 Donâ€™t worry about the money.

1186
01:44:02,375 --> 01:44:04,125
Okay, Iâ€™ll try to do that.

1187
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:25,166
Hello?

1188
01:44:25,416 --> 01:44:28,000
We have arrested him and reopened his old cases.

1189
01:44:28,916 --> 01:44:30,875
Iâ€™ll arrange for the
 pending amount. Okay.

1190
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:40,250
Hello madam...

1191
01:44:40,291 --> 01:44:41,166
Is the job done?

1192
01:44:41,416 --> 01:44:42,250
Yes madam itâ€™s done.

1193
01:44:42,666 --> 01:44:44,750
Iâ€™m at the old processing unit as instructed.

1194
01:44:45,125 --> 01:44:46,625
Itâ€™s a huge space.

1195
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:48,041
It is a very good property.

1196
01:44:48,875 --> 01:44:50,375
What am I supposed to do here?

1197
01:44:51,166 --> 01:44:51,666
Hello?

1198
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:52,875
Madam?

1199
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:54,625
Hello?

1200
01:45:01,541 --> 01:45:02,500
Prabhu anna...

1201
01:45:03,166 --> 01:45:04,666
Madam wonâ€™t receive your phone call.

1202
01:45:07,791 --> 01:45:09,791
Iâ€™ve kept water for washing and drinking.

1203
01:45:11,291 --> 01:45:13,125
Iâ€™ll be back in two days with food.

1204
01:45:17,500 --> 01:45:18,375
Okay bye.

1205
01:45:18,916 --> 01:45:19,500
Hey!!!!

1206
01:45:19,541 --> 01:45:21,541
Hey Manu!

1207
01:45:22,041 --> 01:45:23,250
Hey Manu!

1208
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:29,875
Manu!

1209
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:33,916
Manu!

1210
01:45:39,791 --> 01:45:43,000
Iâ€™ve got the intimation from the
 bank. I wonâ€™t bother you again.

1211
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:44,375
Manu!

1212
01:45:44,875 --> 01:45:47,041
Iâ€™ve transferred another two lakhs to Deepak.

1213
01:45:47,166 --> 01:45:47,916
Wait! Stop car!

1214
01:45:48,125 --> 01:45:48,916
Why? What happened!

1215
01:45:49,041 --> 01:45:49,666
Iâ€™ll be back

1216
01:45:52,291 --> 01:45:52,791
Take this.

1217
01:45:59,416 --> 01:46:00,000
Hey!!!!

1218
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:01,166
Hey Manu!

1219
01:46:03,041 --> 01:46:05,375
Tell me how much you
 want! Iâ€™ll get it done!

1220
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:06,250
Open the Door!

1221
01:46:06,416 --> 01:46:07,000
Hey!

1222
01:46:09,416 --> 01:46:10,666
Iâ€™ll send you in for 10 more years

1223
01:46:10,791 --> 01:46:12,250
You still havenâ€™t learnt your lesson.

1224
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:15,125
You are one to talk.

1225
01:46:15,666 --> 01:46:16,791
Open the door...

1226
01:46:20,250 --> 01:46:21,625
Why all this sir?

1227
01:46:22,166 --> 01:46:23,375
You look good sir.

1228
01:46:23,416 --> 01:46:24,291
Good luck.

1229
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,625
Your song has just released and its a superhit

1230
01:46:32,541 --> 01:46:35,000
Oye. Whatâ€™s on your mind?

1231
01:46:36,875 --> 01:46:42,541
â€œHas the wind songâ€

1232
01:46:44,291 --> 01:46:49,625
â€œblown along?â€

1233
01:46:50,916 --> 01:46:56,125
â€œThe journey unfinishedâ€

1234
01:46:58,041 --> 01:47:04,500
â€œThe destination obscured.â€

1235
01:47:05,541 --> 01:47:12,000
â€œTime is always specialâ€

1236
01:47:12,500 --> 01:47:18,541
â€œIt's like a far sailing vesselâ€

1237
01:47:19,541 --> 01:47:21,416
Hey... use this.

1238
01:47:23,250 --> 01:47:24,375
Use this to make one.

1239
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:25,541
Give it here

1240
01:47:45,791 --> 01:47:46,750
My number is 16

1241
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:50,916
You love singing right?

1242
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,875
Letâ€™s get a clock for every room.

1243
01:48:00,625 --> 01:48:01,541
Loafer

1244
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:04,375
Which one do you like?

1245
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:08,541
I like this one.

1246
01:48:09,625 --> 01:48:10,750
Is it hanging properly?

1247
01:48:14,541 --> 01:48:15,875
Does it look cheap?

1248
01:48:17,291 --> 01:48:18,666
Itâ€™s working, thatâ€™s enough.

1249
01:48:20,041 --> 01:48:20,875
Where are you sir?

1250
01:48:21,166 --> 01:48:22,625
Iâ€™m out of town on work.

1251
01:48:23,416 --> 01:48:24,666
Why sir? Didnâ€™t I tell youâ€¦

1252
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:25,916
Iâ€™m with you in spirit.

1253
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:27,875
Once Iâ€™m back,
 my first meal will be at your hotel.

1254
01:48:28,041 --> 01:48:29,166
Please donâ€™t miss it.

1255
01:48:31,125 --> 01:48:36,875
â€œThe undisturbed small lightâ€

1256
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:52,250
â€œThe passing time, yesterday, tomorrowâ€

1257
01:48:55,125 --> 01:49:00,750
â€œAnd today in you.â€

1258
01:49:01,166 --> 01:49:07,166
â€œTime is always specialâ€

1259
01:49:07,416 --> 01:49:12,750
â€œIt's like a far sailing vesselâ€

1260
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:25,291
â€œWhy doesn't it wait or settleâ€

1261
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:36,916
Did the function go smoothly?

1262
01:49:37,500 --> 01:49:38,500
Very nicely.

1263
01:49:39,125 --> 01:49:40,000
Priya?

1264
01:49:41,125 --> 01:49:42,500
She was very happy!

1265
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:46,000
Do you want coffee or tea?

1266
01:49:47,125 --> 01:49:47,666
No

1267
01:49:55,291 --> 01:49:57,875
Manu... You are living in the same
 darkness, youâ€™ve kept Prabhu in.

1268
01:49:59,375 --> 01:50:01,250
Let him go...

1269
01:50:01,666 --> 01:50:03,500
Why donâ€™t you settle down?

1270
01:50:08,041 --> 01:50:11,750
Prabhu anna. The hotel has opened. Take this.

1271
01:50:36,250 --> 01:50:38,791
What happened Prabhu anna?

1272
01:50:42,375 --> 01:50:45,791
My grandson loves sweets.

1273
01:50:48,750 --> 01:50:50,250
Please Manu.

1274
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:52,500
I canâ€™t bear it anymore.

1275
01:50:52,916 --> 01:50:54,666
Please let me go.

1276
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:58,375
Iâ€™m going mad here! I canâ€™tâ€¦

1277
01:50:59,875 --> 01:51:03,125
I can't anymore. I don't
 know if it's day or night.

1278
01:51:03,166 --> 01:51:04,666
You'll wont know.

1279
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,541
The stench, the dirtâ€¦
 all of lifeâ€™s memories haunt you.

1280
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:14,125
Only that dark room knows....

1281
01:51:14,125 --> 01:51:16,166
How much youâ€™ve loved and...

1282
01:51:16,250 --> 01:51:19,916
how many people youâ€™ve cheated.

1283
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:26,666
Iâ€™m beginning to
 understand my mistakes.

1284
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:30,375
How much longer Manu?

1285
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,666
She hasnâ€™t started singing yet...

1286
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:51,916
[Announcement by Blind singing group]

1287
01:52:59,375 --> 01:53:01,250
You sing really well.

1288
01:53:02,125 --> 01:53:03,125
Whatâ€™s your name?

1289
01:53:03,625 --> 01:53:04,500
Shriya

1290
01:53:07,416 --> 01:53:08,750
Shriya.

1291
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,541
These grapes are sweet!

1292
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:24,000
Loafer!

1293
01:53:24,125 --> 01:53:25,125
What is this?

1294
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:33,500
Hello,

1295
01:53:35,291 --> 01:53:36,125
One moment...

1296
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,125
Yes Deepak.

1297
01:53:50,500 --> 01:53:51,541
Ok, coming.

1298
01:53:57,375 --> 01:53:58,416
Iâ€™ve to step out...

1299
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:00,541
What happened?

1300
01:54:03,666 --> 01:54:05,375
You had said weâ€™ll have dinner together.
 And youâ€™re off now.

1301
01:54:05,666 --> 01:54:06,666
Now youâ€™re off now.

1302
01:54:07,666 --> 01:54:08,625
You go ahead.

1303
01:54:08,916 --> 01:54:10,041
You go ahead, Iâ€™ll eat outside

1304
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:13,291
Iâ€™ll be late.

1305
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:26,250
I didnâ€™t know who else to call sir...

1306
01:54:31,625 --> 01:54:32,375
Deepak sir...

1307
01:54:36,166 --> 01:54:37,000
Look at him sir...

1308
01:54:37,416 --> 01:54:38,916
This lying b*******d!!

1309
01:54:40,791 --> 01:54:42,750
He lied that he was from Dubai.

1310
01:54:43,625 --> 01:54:44,916
But in reality, heâ€™s a cab driver.

1311
01:54:45,416 --> 01:54:46,875
I caught him red handed at Sarakki signal

1312
01:54:47,375 --> 01:54:48,625
He cleared my loan.

1313
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:50,916
Heâ€™s the one who funded the
 opening of this new hotel sir!

1314
01:54:52,625 --> 01:54:55,000
Iâ€™m not able to figure out his scheme.

1315
01:54:55,625 --> 01:54:57,666
He remains silent when I ask any questions.

1316
01:54:58,375 --> 01:54:59,875
What shall I do sir?

1317
01:55:03,916 --> 01:55:05,291
I know a place.

1318
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:06,875
Letâ€™s take him there.

1319
01:55:07,041 --> 01:55:07,916
Okay sir.

1320
01:55:19,625 --> 01:55:20,041
Sirâ€¦?

1321
01:55:20,291 --> 01:55:21,541
What is this place?

1322
01:55:23,166 --> 01:55:24,041
Come

1323
01:55:28,291 --> 01:55:30,041
Come... careful

1324
01:55:33,291 --> 01:55:34,541
What kind of a place is this sir?

1325
01:55:34,791 --> 01:55:35,791
Looks abandoned.

1326
01:55:36,375 --> 01:55:38,000
Come, we can sit here.

1327
01:55:39,041 --> 01:55:43,166
Manu, thereâ€™s no water.
 The stench is unbearable!

1328
01:55:44,541 --> 01:55:45,291
Who is that sir?

1329
01:55:45,416 --> 01:55:46,875
One min, Iâ€™ll send some water.

1330
01:55:46,916 --> 01:55:47,750
Please send soon.

1331
01:55:49,125 --> 01:55:49,875
Itâ€™s okay sir.

1332
01:55:50,375 --> 01:55:51,791
Weâ€™ll settle this on our own.

1333
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:56,250
Sir, the person inside is Prabhu.

1334
01:55:56,541 --> 01:55:58,750
Where do I start about this manâ€™s madness...

1335
01:56:05,041 --> 01:56:06,041
Deepak...

1336
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:08,875
Deepak!

1337
01:56:09,416 --> 01:56:10,291
Deepak!

1338
01:56:12,916 --> 01:56:14,875
I had such a wonderful
 dream the other night!

1339
01:56:15,041 --> 01:56:16,875
I woke up because of a loud noise.

1340
01:56:17,875 --> 01:56:20,541
I tried so hard but I
 couldnâ€™t revisit that dream.

1341
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,166
You know what that dream was?

1342
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,125
The sea close to home
 that Iâ€™ve told you about.

1343
01:56:24,291 --> 01:56:26,125
Iâ€™ve taken you there.

1344
01:56:26,791 --> 01:56:29,666
Thereâ€™s not a soul in sight for miles...

1345
01:56:40,625 --> 01:56:42,041
Your wife must sing, sir.

1346
01:56:43,750 --> 01:56:45,541
Thatâ€™s the only cure to
 this fellowâ€™s madness.

1347
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,666
Priya doesnâ€™tâ€¦

1348
01:56:49,916 --> 01:56:51,791
Your wife doesnâ€™t know Iâ€™m alive.

1349
01:56:51,916 --> 01:56:53,625
And I donâ€™t want her to find out.

1350
01:56:55,625 --> 01:56:58,625
I know how much you
 love her and your family.

1351
01:57:00,625 --> 01:57:04,375
But youâ€™ve never seen the
 joy on her face when she sings.

1352
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:07,916
Thereâ€™s still time.

1353
01:57:10,375 --> 01:57:11,375
Give me this!

1354
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:16,125
Take this sir.

1355
01:57:17,166 --> 01:57:17,875
Take it

1356
01:57:18,625 --> 01:57:21,500
First, ask him to delete that audio.

1357
01:57:23,125 --> 01:57:25,750
Correct sir. Iâ€™ll get it deleted

1358
01:57:26,541 --> 01:57:28,375
Hey! Give me your phone.

1359
01:57:28,666 --> 01:57:30,166
Give me your phone!

1360
01:57:31,541 --> 01:57:32,166
Give it now.

1361
01:57:34,541 --> 01:57:36,541
Saving the cassette was my mistake.

1362
01:57:37,666 --> 01:57:39,125
Prakasha...

1363
01:57:41,875 --> 01:57:44,166
Look here sir. Itâ€™s deleted.

1364
01:57:45,416 --> 01:57:45,791
Okay now?

1365
01:57:46,291 --> 01:57:47,291
Please take this sir.

1366
01:57:52,375 --> 01:57:54,125
Please make her sing sir.

1367
01:57:54,750 --> 01:57:57,250
I beg you! For my sake, make her sing!

1368
01:57:58,375 --> 01:58:01,125
What the hell kind of a fix is this....

1369
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:09,500
Putti?

1370
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:11,875
Youâ€™re still awake?

1371
01:58:16,625 --> 01:58:17,375
Idiot...

1372
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:20,250
I had such a wonderful
 dream the other night!

1373
01:58:22,875 --> 01:58:23,375
Putti...

1374
01:58:23,791 --> 01:58:24,541
Who the hell is Putti?!!

1375
01:58:25,041 --> 01:58:26,000
Who the f**k is she?!!

1376
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Who is she?

1377
01:58:27,375 --> 01:58:29,500
Didnâ€™t you find anyone
 else to satisfy your desire?!!

1378
01:58:30,291 --> 01:58:30,791
Answer me!

1379
01:58:31,041 --> 01:58:31,541
Answer me!

1380
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:33,666
Why didnâ€™t you find a
 railway track instead!

1381
01:58:33,791 --> 01:58:35,041
Tell me you a*****e!!!

1382
01:58:38,125 --> 01:58:39,375
You want to mess with me?

1383
01:58:39,750 --> 01:58:41,000
You want to listen to her sing right?

1384
01:58:41,041 --> 01:58:42,375
Listen to it, go ahead!

1385
01:58:42,875 --> 01:58:43,625
Youâ€™ll find nothing...

1386
01:58:43,625 --> 01:58:44,791
Iâ€™ve burnt them all to ashes!

1387
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,125
Today Iâ€™ve burnt this! Tomorrow Iâ€™ll burn everything!

1388
01:58:47,250 --> 01:58:49,750
That b****h, Iâ€™ll burn her too!

1389
01:58:57,791 --> 01:58:59,791
You will never be able to fill her place.

1390
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:45,041
You can put the fall for this

1391
01:59:45,375 --> 01:59:47,125
Could you show the back?

1392
01:59:48,500 --> 01:59:49,875
Is there another colour?

1393
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:52,250
Yes Madam, there are other colours

1394
01:59:58,250 --> 02:00:00,000
Nothing is nice at this store!

1395
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I know how to screw you B*&amp;*h

1396
02:00:05,375 --> 02:00:06,250
Iâ€™m hungry Manu.

1397
02:00:06,625 --> 02:00:08,500
Yesterday also you were late.

1398
02:00:08,875 --> 02:00:10,625
Iâ€™m starving.

1399
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,125
Wait Prabhu anna.

1400
02:00:14,125 --> 02:00:16,125
How many more days should I suffer?

1401
02:01:02,625 --> 02:01:03,500
Sunila...

1402
02:01:04,625 --> 02:01:06,250
...the biryani was nice, wasnâ€™t it?

1403
02:01:06,291 --> 02:01:07,250
It was super anna!

1404
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,000
I feel like eating something sweet now.

1405
02:01:09,666 --> 02:01:10,416
Shall I get you some?

1406
02:01:11,250 --> 02:01:12,750
Go fetch Manuâ€™s girl instead.

1407
02:01:13,291 --> 02:01:14,041
Okay.

1408
02:01:21,041 --> 02:01:23,791
You want to hurt me As**%*e?

1409
02:01:23,916 --> 02:01:25,375
Iâ€™ll show you...

1410
02:01:26,375 --> 02:01:28,750
Iâ€™ll know how to screw you over...

1411
02:01:29,625 --> 02:01:32,000
Youâ€™ll see what Iâ€™ll do to that B*#*h.

1412
02:01:32,166 --> 02:01:33,291
You watch....

1413
02:01:57,958 --> 02:01:59,083
Oye mole face!

1414
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:03,875
Comeâ€¦ let me console you.

1415
02:02:07,166 --> 02:02:08,166
Come baby!

1416
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:29,125
Sunila!

1417
02:02:33,041 --> 02:02:34,750
This table is making some funny sounds.

1418
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:36,625
(local slang for sex worker)

1419
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:39,875
Take her away. I canâ€™t bear her whining.

1420
02:02:51,125 --> 02:02:54,125
Your mother used to tell me
 that you sing really well...

1421
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:55,875
Why donâ€™t you give it a try?

1422
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:25,250
Nothing will happen, come

1423
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:32,750
What will you do if she sings today, Manu?

1424
02:03:32,875 --> 02:03:34,500
I plan to go and settle by the sea.

1425
02:03:35,541 --> 02:03:38,291
If I open the tap, the fish must
 fall right into the bucket!

1426
02:03:39,625 --> 02:03:40,625
And what about me?

1427
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:43,125
What sweet does you grandson like?

1428
02:03:55,125 --> 02:03:55,625
Surabhi?

1429
02:03:55,666 --> 02:03:56,625
Listen to me please...

1430
02:03:56,875 --> 02:03:58,250
Priya is an old chapter

1431
02:03:58,375 --> 02:03:59,500
I havenâ€™t met her either

1432
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:00,875
Tell me where you are...Iâ€™ll come...

1433
02:04:00,875 --> 02:04:01,875
...Who is Priya, Manu?

1434
02:04:02,250 --> 02:04:03,125
Another babe?

1435
02:04:03,625 --> 02:04:05,000
Wonâ€™t you introduce me to her?

1436
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:08,625
Get her Manu, letâ€™s party together

1437
02:04:09,041 --> 02:04:09,750
Manu...

1438
02:04:16,125 --> 02:04:16,750
Prakasha...

1439
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:23,916
Take this Madam, 1st floor

1440
02:04:24,125 --> 02:04:25,500
Take Amma, sing well

1441
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:28,000
There are a lot of people
 .youâ€™ll have to stand in the queue

1442
02:05:25,041 --> 02:05:25,791
Ohh is it?!

1443
02:05:28,416 --> 02:05:29,000
Where is Surabhi?

1444
02:05:29,333 --> 02:05:29,958
Aye Manu!

1445
02:05:30,375 --> 02:05:30,875
Where is she?

1446
02:05:41,875 --> 02:05:43,125
Where is Surabhi?

1447
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:45,416
Tell me!

1448
02:05:45,916 --> 02:05:46,791
Tell me!

1449
02:05:46,916 --> 02:05:47,916
Iâ€™ll tell!

1450
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:48,583
Iâ€™ll tell you!

1451
02:05:52,666 --> 02:05:55,916
It felt good when you choked me Manu

1452
02:06:23,166 --> 02:06:25,416
Boys! Get everyone!

1453
02:06:25,666 --> 02:06:26,375
Sunila!

1454
02:06:26,416 --> 02:06:27,125
Sunila!

1455
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:46,041
Manu...?

1456
02:07:48,166 --> 02:07:49,000
Manu...

1457
02:07:52,666 --> 02:07:54,541
That's it boys, lock him up!

1458
02:07:58,166 --> 02:08:00,541
Aye, Sunila! Come fast...

1459
02:08:16,666 --> 02:08:17,666
Manu...

1460
02:08:18,416 --> 02:08:19,291
Manu...

1461
02:08:19,541 --> 02:08:21,166
Manu... Manu... Manu...

1462
02:08:23,166 --> 02:08:23,500
Sunila!

1463
02:08:24,208 --> 02:08:24,833
Sunila!

1464
02:08:28,291 --> 02:08:29,666
Hey Sunila!

1465
02:08:29,916 --> 02:08:30,916
Boys, get here now!

1466
02:08:30,916 --> 02:08:32,166
Bheema! Come fast!

1467
02:08:32,166 --> 02:08:33,250
Call everyone!

1468
02:08:33,291 --> 02:08:33,916
Come quickly!

1469
02:08:34,250 --> 02:08:35,291
Aye! Donâ€™t spare him

1470
02:08:35,291 --> 02:08:36,291
Cut him up!

1471
02:08:36,291 --> 02:08:38,041
Go! Go! Go!

1472
02:08:54,958 --> 02:08:56,416
Surabhi!

1473
02:10:02,416 --> 02:10:04,250
Su.. Surabhi...

1474
02:10:54,791 --> 02:10:56,416
Give me the bag...

1475
02:10:57,666 --> 02:10:59,041
All the best!

1476
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,125
All the best amma!

1477
02:11:57,750 --> 02:11:59,000
I am Priya Deepak.

1478
02:11:59,916 --> 02:12:00,666
Contestant #60.

1479
02:12:02,375 --> 02:12:04,000
Song is from the
 film Bisilu Kudure...

1480
02:12:04,791 --> 02:12:06,541
â€˜Kadalanu Kaana Horatiroâ€™

1481
02:12:28,541 --> 02:12:29,291
Sing please!

1482
02:12:38,291 --> 02:12:38,666
Surabhi!

1483
02:12:40,666 --> 02:12:41,291
Manu...

1484
02:12:42,416 --> 02:12:43,791
Letâ€™s talk it out Manu...

1485
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:46,916
Listen to me

1486
02:13:24,791 --> 02:13:25,791
Hey mole-face!

1487
02:13:26,291 --> 02:13:28,041
We make a good pair.

1488
02:13:28,291 --> 02:13:31,666
You are dumb and I'm deaf.

1489
02:13:39,916 --> 02:13:40,791
Surabhi...

1490
02:13:51,791 --> 02:13:52,541
Priya!

1491
02:13:57,291 --> 02:13:58,041
Priya!

1492
02:13:58,916 --> 02:13:59,791
Listen to me...

1493
02:14:00,166 --> 02:14:01,541
Itâ€™s time Prakasha...

1494
02:14:02,291 --> 02:14:03,541
If anything were to happen...

1495
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:07,041
You know what to do with the money...

1496
02:14:07,625 --> 02:14:08,416
Manu!

1497
02:14:08,791 --> 02:14:09,541
Manu!

1498
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,125
I won't let anything happen to you.

1499
02:14:18,166 --> 02:14:21,750
I didnâ€™t realize that I had given a
 small peice of my heart to you

1500
02:14:23,666 --> 02:14:27,916
Nothing will happen to you.
 I will go fetch the Doctor.

1501
02:14:30,791 --> 02:14:33,375
You didn't tell me your real name...

1502
02:14:41,625 --> 02:14:45,958
A â€˜Doctorâ€™ before your name will look nice...

1503
02:14:48,791 --> 02:14:52,541
Nothing will happen.
 I will go get help!

1504
02:15:29,666 --> 02:15:32,916
Putti, donâ€™t stop singing...

1505
02:16:05,166 --> 02:16:15,416
â€œThe cloud seems shy on its way to meet the seaâ€

1506
02:16:16,916 --> 02:16:25,791
â€œThe evening ray colouring the sky asks, shall I join theeâ€

1507
02:16:28,166 --> 02:16:33,541
â€œThere's a boat is sailing far yonderâ€

1508
02:16:33,541 --> 02:16:38,166
â€œDisappearing in its isolation into a blurâ€

1509
02:16:39,166 --> 02:16:44,666
â€œIs this a dream somebody drewâ€

1510
02:16:44,916 --> 02:16:50,416
â€œShall I name it after you?â€

1511
02:16:59,666 --> 02:17:04,291
â€œA name I've forgotten though...â€

1512
02:17:18,791 --> 02:17:21,291
I tried so hard but I
 couldnâ€™t revisit that dream.

1513
02:17:23,416 --> 02:17:25,041
You know what that dream was?

1514
02:17:26,166 --> 02:17:27,666
The sea close to homeâ€¦

1515
02:17:28,166 --> 02:17:29,916
Iâ€™ve taken you there...

1516
02:17:36,416 --> 02:17:39,041
Thereâ€™s not a soul in sight for miles...

1517
02:17:39,666 --> 02:17:41,541
Just you, me and the sea.

1518
02:17:42,791 --> 02:17:44,541
We were walking right next to the sea...

1519
02:17:45,541 --> 02:17:47,916
The waves were wiping away our footprints...

1520
02:17:48,666 --> 02:17:50,416
I was holding your hand tightly.

1521
02:17:51,541 --> 02:17:53,291
We were so happy, you know?

1522
02:17:54,541 --> 02:17:57,416
Even now, if I close my eyes, I can
 hear the sound of the waves

1523
02:17:58,666 --> 02:17:59,916
Do you also hear it?

1524
02:18:02,666 --> 02:18:08,291
â€œWaves after waves...â€

1525
02:18:08,625 --> 02:18:13,541
â€œYet no sign of the shore.â€

1526
02:18:14,291 --> 02:18:19,416
â€œIn the tune you eschewedâ€

1527
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:25,041
â€œUnknown I shall remainâ€

1528
02:18:25,791 --> 02:18:29,791
â€œAn unrecallable remembranceâ€

1529
02:18:44,291 --> 02:18:54,791
â€œThe cloud seems shy on its way to meet the seaâ€

1530
02:19:35,166 --> 02:19:36,666
I wonâ€™t stop singing...

1531
02:19:52,291 --> 02:19:53,041
Idiot...

1532
02:20:26,291 --> 02:20:28,291
Donâ€™t feel bad that Iâ€™m leaving.

1533
02:20:29,791 --> 02:20:34,291
I think the sea was my destiny...

1534
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:44,375
I have no regrets anymore...

1535
02:20:45,541 --> 02:20:47,250
Iâ€™m not going alone...

1536
02:20:48,750 --> 02:20:53,625
Iâ€™m taking small pieces of you along with me...

1537
02:21:03,291 --> 02:21:04,291
Two fish fries...

1538
02:21:14,125 --> 02:21:16,166
My story is now a part of the sea.

1539
02:21:17,375 --> 02:21:19,500
The last chapter of that story...

1540
02:21:20,375 --> 02:21:22,291
...Is yours to fill.

1541
02:21:45,125 --> 02:21:47,041
Come letâ€™s go.
