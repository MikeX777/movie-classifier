Good Lord!

13
00:03:18,942 --> 00:03:20,554
What is that?

14
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,073
The Kryakovskys.

Those are the Fylonovskys.

19
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,192
They're going on strike!

20
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:04,652
Where are you going, Nikolai?

21
00:04:05,648 --> 00:04:08,033
We have to support them.

22
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,645
Who do we need to support?

23
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:36,952
Well guys, let's go to the factory.

24
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:39,570
Wait, Kolka, I'll teach you a lesson.

25
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:42,603
What?

26
00:04:42,676 --> 00:04:45,159
I'll teach you a lesson.

27
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:47,333
Boss, I won't take any lessons from you.

28
00:04:47,404 --> 00:04:49,342
Let's go, guys.

29
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:15,485
Brothers... what are you doing?

30
00:05:16,476 --> 00:05:18,960
Where are you going?

31
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,167
What the hell are you doing?

32
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:26,662
Let's go, let's go.

33
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,435
I order you to disperse immediately.

34
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,535
I give you one minute to think.

35
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,840
Those arrested will not be released.

36
00:07:50,145 --> 00:07:51,703
Hey!

37
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,138
Guys, have mercy!

38
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:40,204
Beat me instead, you scoundrel!

39
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:46,622
You're beating students!

40
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,949
Beat me instead! You're
beating educated people,

41
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:53,587
damn it!

42
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:40,906
Wait, guys...

43
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:45,598
What's going on?

44
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,641
Robert Karlovich. Hey, Robert Karlovich.

45
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,686
Would you like to play checkers?

46
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,992
Mit grossen Vergnugen!

47
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,722
With great pleasure,
Alexander Petrovich,

48
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:32,151
but give me a minute.

49
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:36,780
I have to finish the
letter to my son in Germany.

50
00:10:36,848 --> 00:10:39,266
Please, have a seat.

51
00:11:24,514 --> 00:11:26,877
Anka.

52
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,363
Are you running around
again? Can't stay at home?

53
00:11:42,948 --> 00:11:47,894
You have a nice girl,
Alexander Petrovich.

54
00:11:53,203 --> 00:11:55,654
- Go, go.
- Goodbye.

55
00:12:06,174 --> 00:12:10,030
I got yours, Alexander Petrovich.

56
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:18,277
Hello, Alexander Feodorovich.

57
00:12:19,976 --> 00:12:21,980
Alexander Feodorovich!

58
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:25,875
Alexander Feodorovich!
How long will it last?

59
00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:28,978
- Will what last?
- The strike.

60
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,822
God knows!

61
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:39,487
So, that's the situation.

62
00:12:40,613 --> 00:12:44,698
And who is Alexander Feodorovich?

63
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:49,238
Our new tenant.

64
00:12:55,885 --> 00:13:01,375
Social revolutionary
democrat... a striker.

65
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,610
He is one of those who
organized a strike in 1905.

66
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,396
And this one as well.

67
00:14:30,322 --> 00:14:33,895
Look, he went somewhere again.

68
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:08,393
Daddy.

69
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:11,396
Daddy.

70
00:16:13,385 --> 00:16:16,696
- Something happened.
- What do you want?

71
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:22,965
Get up, Senka.

72
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:29,253
Sen.

73
00:16:33,768 --> 00:16:37,177
You sleep like hell. Senka!

74
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:45,268
Get up, Senka.

75
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,435
- I'm talking to you.
- Why should I get up?

76
00:16:49,103 --> 00:16:51,554
Dusya came.

77
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,630
Get out.

78
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,938
Let's go, let's go. I'm talking to you.

79
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:05,394
Guten Morgen, Robert Karlovich.

80
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,390
Hello, Alexander Petrovich.

81
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,772
Hey, Robert Karlovich,

82
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,217
shouldn't we go get some beer?

83
00:17:17,281 --> 00:17:21,431
Alexander Petrovich, don't you
know what is whistling over there?

84
00:17:28,015 --> 00:17:30,378
They are whistling.

85
00:17:30,443 --> 00:17:32,415
Maybe something has happened.

86
00:17:32,488 --> 00:17:36,311
Let's go have a look and
get some beer on our way.

87
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:40,470
With a great pleasure,
Alexander Petrovich.

88
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,469
I am getting ready.

89
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:10,313
What's going on, Robert Karlovich?

90
00:18:10,378 --> 00:18:15,159
Where is my hat?

91
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:26,954
One minute.

92
00:18:32,454 --> 00:18:34,655
Try this on.

93
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:42,029
What do you think, Alexander Petrovich?

94
00:18:42,102 --> 00:18:45,032
I think it's fine.

95
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:49,506
I think so, too. Let's go.

96
00:19:09,736 --> 00:19:12,895
URGENT TELEGRAM Germany
Has Declared War On Russia

97
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:15,893
Germany Has Declared War On
Russia Departure Of Ambassadors

98
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:19,986
Departure Of Ambassadors
To Russian People!

99
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,912
We'll win easily.

100
00:19:28,905 --> 00:19:31,170
My dear Robert Karlovich,

101
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:34,461
we'll easily defeat those scoundrels!

102
00:19:34,528 --> 00:19:36,891
What are you saying,
Alexander Petrovich?

103
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm saying that we've got it won.

104
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:46,276
You won't win, Alexander
Petrovich, we can fight pretty well.

105
00:19:47,818 --> 00:19:50,497
You know me.

106
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:55,925
We have always fought
together for your rights.

107
00:19:55,997 --> 00:19:59,569
And you have trusted me and
you should trust me again.

108
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:04,203
Now, in this fateful moment

109
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:07,582
when the Germans have
conquered our borders...

110
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:10,523
what should we do?

111
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:13,723
You should look for the
answer to this question

112
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:17,202
in the heart of the Russian man.

113
00:20:17,275 --> 00:20:24,933
In the face of the external enemy,
let's forget internal class strife

114
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:28,709
and stop the strike.

115
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:32,447
Let's bravely go to battle

116
00:20:32,513 --> 00:20:35,607
believing in victory.

117
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:42,216
Go to battle!

118
00:23:19,025 --> 00:23:21,672
What are you doing?

119
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:23,876
What are you doing? I am asking you.

120
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:27,735
- I'll go.
- Where will you go?

121
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,457
He won't go anywhere.

122
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:36,115
- No, I'll go.
- Where will you go?

123
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,249
Volunteer.

124
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,998
If I said so, it means I'll go.

125
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:50,678
I'm telling you, I'll go.

126
00:23:53,688 --> 00:23:56,139
I'm telling you, I'll go.

127
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,517
What are you doing?

128
00:24:00,589 --> 00:24:03,454
You're taking everything with you.

129
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:05,663
I'm telling you, let me go!

130
00:24:08,384 --> 00:24:10,388
Wait.

131
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:15,338
Cowards.

132
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:19,335
I'll show you! You're
not going anywhere!

133
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:23,556
Cowards, I told you to let me go!

134
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:36,424
What a fool.

135
00:25:40,362 --> 00:25:42,431
So, Petrovich,

136
00:25:42,502 --> 00:25:44,637
I am leaving my horse with you.

137
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,149
Take care of it.

138
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,421
I'll pay you when I return.

139
00:25:50,489 --> 00:25:53,234
If I don't return, keep it.

140
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:52,109
It's war. Band together, brothers!

141
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,446
They want to enslave and destroy us.

142
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:57,922
For our Father Tsar, for our Motherland,

143
00:26:57,995 --> 00:27:02,624
for Orthodox faith, let's fight.

144
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:06,907
All of us will go for the purpose of...

145
00:27:06,972 --> 00:27:12,942
Lord, bless us to win.

146
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:15,395
Hurrah.

147
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:17,855
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.

148
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:05,048
God bless you, sons.

149
00:28:18,855 --> 00:28:21,272
"Contract".

150
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:29,866
"Authorized representative of the
Union of cities in the person of...

151
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:36,996
on the one hand,

152
00:28:37,065 --> 00:28:44,538
and merchant of II Guild,
Mikin, on the other hand.

153
00:28:46,712 --> 00:28:56,898
The present Contract on the supply of
boots to the army at the price of..."

154
00:29:49,713 --> 00:29:51,848
With a rasp, with a rasp.

155
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:55,806
Clean harder, harder.

156
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,005
Move like that, like that.

157
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:33,861
# And the German infantry #

158
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:37,404
# Faces the "Fortress on the Rhine" #

159
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:40,340
# And our brave cavalry #

160
00:30:40,414 --> 00:30:43,192
# Is finally chasing after them #

161
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,253
# The artillery, with 10 big guns #

162
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:50,824
# And courage like old Fritz #

163
00:30:50,894 --> 00:30:54,184
# Cannons rumbling by one by one #

164
00:30:54,248 --> 00:30:57,854
# A forest full of bayonets #

165
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,113
# Slash like lighting through the air #

166
00:31:01,181 --> 00:31:04,046
# And finally they call halt. #

167
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:34,400
- Hello, Robert Karlovich.
- Hello.

168
00:31:57,664 --> 00:32:02,196
Be so kind as to accept what I owe you.

169
00:32:02,265 --> 00:32:05,130
That's very kind of you.

170
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,553
Anichka.

171
00:33:57,308 --> 00:34:00,467
No more checkers.

172
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:04,326
Daddy, Daddy, are the Germans...

173
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,941
"Daddy, Daddy". What do you want?

174
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:39,315
Hey!

175
00:34:39,383 --> 00:34:41,519
Robert Karlovich!

176
00:35:17,242 --> 00:35:21,033
Oh, son, son! The years you've wasted!

177
00:35:39,413 --> 00:35:42,311
One, two, three, four, five.

178
00:35:42,384 --> 00:35:45,162
Six, seven, eight...

179
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,363
Cut it out!

180
00:37:14,489 --> 00:37:16,941
Does someone need this?

181
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,615
No.

182
00:38:34,455 --> 00:38:36,720
Kolka.

183
00:38:37,713 --> 00:38:39,597
Kolya.

184
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:42,821
Nikolai... Kolka!

185
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:45,024
What do you want?

186
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:06,366
Go to the front line!

187
00:40:06,433 --> 00:40:08,404
Quickly!

188
00:40:28,157 --> 00:40:30,869
Why did you stay here?

189
00:40:33,907 --> 00:40:36,075
I am asking, why?

190
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:41,989
- My tooth hurts.
- Get the hell out!

191
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:45,365
- I'll show you.
- What did I do? What?

192
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,534
- I'll show you.
- What have I done to you?

193
00:40:57,804 --> 00:41:00,069
- I'll show you.
- What have I done to you?

194
00:41:00,136 --> 00:41:03,873
What have I done to you?

195
00:41:06,526 --> 00:41:10,000
What have I done to you?

196
00:41:14,353 --> 00:41:21,597
What have I done to you?
What for? Leave me alone...!

197
00:42:57,896 --> 00:43:00,641
Are you alive, or what?

198
00:43:08,406 --> 00:43:10,607
It's okay. It's okay.

199
00:43:21,889 --> 00:43:25,461
This means you're in
captivity. Hey, you...

200
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:11,274
OUR VALIANT TROOPS HELD
THE FRONT LINE OF THE ENEMY,

201
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:15,876
HAVING SEIZED RICH BOOTY AND PRISONERS.

202
00:44:27,701 --> 00:44:31,884
You scoundrels, betrayers of
Jesus, you're all around here...

203
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:35,141
you have to be shot.

204
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,408
You dirty Russian pigs.

205
00:44:37,476 --> 00:44:40,254
You will have to pay
the price for all of us,

206
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,226
you no-good bums.

207
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:35,543
To the camp for prisoners of war:

208
00:48:35,616 --> 00:48:39,984
Due to difficulties with food,

209
00:48:40,056 --> 00:48:44,424
as of today prisoners of war
are permitted to leave the camp

210
00:48:44,496 --> 00:48:48,864
and go into the city to look for
work from 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

211
00:48:48,937 --> 00:48:53,272
Signed by Colonel...

212
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:51,000
How much is the watch?

213
00:52:57,874 --> 00:53:01,730
No, no, how... how much?

214
00:53:04,998 --> 00:53:07,895
What time is it?

215
00:53:23,496 --> 00:53:26,241
What time is it, sir?

216
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,704
7:00.

217
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,784
It's 7:00 already.

218
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:57,388
I have to get back to the
base. They lock it at 7:30.

219
00:53:57,456 --> 00:54:01,279
After work, we can go to town,
but we have to be back on time.

220
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:07,733
I asked for work all over
town. I am a shoemaker.

221
00:54:07,807 --> 00:54:10,225
Do you understand?

222
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,458
But everybody tells me, "We
don't have any work for Germans".

223
00:54:13,526 --> 00:54:16,750
Russian soldiers at the
front were not as hostile

224
00:54:16,817 --> 00:54:18,919
as the people here in town.

225
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:22,081
Do you understand?

226
00:54:43,205 --> 00:54:45,307
You look a lot like my little sister,

227
00:54:45,378 --> 00:54:47,741
but she's shorter than you.

228
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:50,834
I haven't heard from her in a long time.

229
00:54:51,895 --> 00:54:56,144
I think my little brother
will soon have to join up.

230
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,204
I hope he doesn't end
up on the Western Front,

231
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:01,954
but in Russia instead.
That's better than Verdun.

232
00:55:02,022 --> 00:55:04,059
Do you understand?

233
00:55:04,132 --> 00:55:06,877
No, I don't understand.

234
00:55:06,943 --> 00:55:09,720
It's okay.

235
00:55:09,786 --> 00:55:12,171
I have to go. It's late.

236
00:55:12,246 --> 00:55:14,447
Goodbye.

237
00:55:50,584 --> 00:55:54,156
- Who's here?
- Keep it down, for God's sake.

238
00:55:54,226 --> 00:55:56,840
It's okay.

239
00:56:11,892 --> 00:56:13,896
Keep it down.

240
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:26,960
- Would you like to eat?
- With great pleasure.

241
00:57:27,034 --> 00:57:29,877
- With great pleasure.
- What? What?

242
00:57:29,941 --> 00:57:32,969
"With great pleasure. Pleasure".

243
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,612
"With great pleasure".

244
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:38,979
Do you speak German?

245
00:57:40,771 --> 00:57:42,938
We had Robert Karlovich,
an elderly German.

246
00:57:43,007 --> 00:57:44,793
He left a long time ago.

247
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,245
They played checkers with
my father all the time.

248
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:49,684
He was the one who taught me.

249
00:57:49,748 --> 00:57:52,264
Why didn't you tell me
earlier you could speak German?

250
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,721
We could have had such a
nice conversation coming back.

251
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:57,029
I thought you didn't understand a word.

252
00:57:57,097 --> 00:57:59,809
- Yes.
- What, yes?

253
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,578
- Do you have a knife?
- Right away.

254
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:39,866
Would you like some tea?

255
00:58:39,938 --> 00:58:43,674
I didn't come to have tea. What's
the last name of your guest?

256
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:45,842
- Mueller III.
- What?

257
00:58:45,912 --> 00:58:48,145
Mueller III.

258
00:58:49,586 --> 00:58:52,516
Third... they had three
Muellers in their army.

259
00:58:55,017 --> 00:58:58,143
Look, dear Third.

260
00:58:58,212 --> 00:59:00,575
Do me a favor, turn around and get out.

261
00:59:12,493 --> 00:59:17,634
I insist that you leave.

262
00:59:25,432 --> 00:59:28,046
Get out of here.

263
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:30,599
He is a shoemaker as well.

264
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:33,002
Get out of here, ugly German mug.

265
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:34,973
He is a shoemaker as well.

266
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:37,248
It's a shame, Alexander Petrovich.

267
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:41,236
Stop teaching me! I have
teachers better than you.

268
01:00:03,002 --> 01:00:05,649
Where's the way out?

269
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:11,715
- The way out?
- Yes, yes.

270
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:19,804
There.

271
01:00:24,215 --> 01:00:25,675
Anka.

272
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:52,928
Thank you for everything.

273
01:00:55,556 --> 01:00:57,463
So long.

274
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:21,715
Hey!

275
01:01:30,124 --> 01:01:32,803
Take it out and show it.

276
01:01:36,992 --> 01:01:39,857
Are you a shoemaker?

277
01:01:39,931 --> 01:01:42,796
Yes, I am a shoemaker.

278
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:51,334
You know what? Let's
go. You'll work for me.

279
01:01:51,401 --> 01:01:54,298
I used to work from home as well.

280
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,773
Let's go, let's go.

281
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,718
You shouldn't cry now.

282
01:02:48,843 --> 01:02:52,895
Now we're in war,

283
01:02:52,964 --> 01:02:55,513
and before we win...

284
01:02:58,267 --> 01:03:01,807
we can't feel sorry for our enemies.

285
01:03:04,721 --> 01:03:08,773
You should be with us body and soul.

286
01:03:08,842 --> 01:03:12,066
We are doing the right thing.

287
01:04:22,865 --> 01:04:24,869
Hello, hello.

288
01:04:34,590 --> 01:04:39,339
- Maybe you'd like some tea?
- I don't feel like it.

289
01:04:39,414 --> 01:04:41,777
Why is he here?

290
01:04:47,017 --> 01:04:51,320
Listen, give me the horse.

291
01:05:14,812 --> 01:05:17,774
- Have you seen my folks?
- No, I haven't.

292
01:05:25,418 --> 01:05:27,749
Go on, sew.

293
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:12,822
Boy, what's wrong with you?

294
01:06:12,893 --> 01:06:16,499
Master, his legs are
broken. What a hell.

295
01:06:18,132 --> 01:06:23,655
Master, what should we do now?

296
01:06:26,279 --> 01:06:30,299
If he dies, I'll die, too.

297
01:06:30,369 --> 01:06:35,063
Why are you talking about
the horse and yourself,

298
01:06:35,128 --> 01:06:40,651
when all of Russia is crying?

299
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:43,813
The entire Russian nation
doesn't spare the power

300
01:06:43,883 --> 01:06:46,725
and lives of its best sons

301
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:53,140
in the great heroic war
to defend our Motherland.

302
01:06:53,211 --> 01:07:00,488
Russia will come out of that great
struggle revitalized and strengthened.

303
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,709
It's not the time for despair,

304
01:07:04,776 --> 01:07:08,763
when our hearts are full of joy,

305
01:07:08,833 --> 01:07:13,495
and the idea of victory near.

306
01:07:13,561 --> 01:07:18,790
The victory is close, victory only.

307
01:07:20,175 --> 01:07:24,924
Hit the Germans, defeat the Germans...

308
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:27,994
complete and definite victory.

309
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:31,802
We'll get you out of this dirty hole.

310
01:07:31,867 --> 01:07:34,351
There is no other way.

311
01:07:39,056 --> 01:07:41,060
Mail.

312
01:07:45,445 --> 01:07:48,190
You've got mail.

313
01:07:59,917 --> 01:08:03,207
"To Peter Ivan Gadkin"...

314
01:08:03,272 --> 01:08:05,408
for me.

315
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:17,608
"Dear Peter Ivanovich,
with deep sympathy,

316
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:21,569
we inform you that your
older son, Nikolai Petrovich,

317
01:08:21,643 --> 01:08:25,531
is in the hospital with minor injuries

318
01:08:25,604 --> 01:08:29,492
and your younger son, Semyon Petrovich,

319
01:08:29,566 --> 01:08:33,487
was killed during an attack".

320
01:08:35,348 --> 01:08:38,954
# When the soldiers march through town #

321
01:08:39,022 --> 01:08:42,496
# The girls will open
windows and doors... #

322
01:08:53,654 --> 01:08:55,887
Stop singing.

323
01:08:55,954 --> 01:08:58,764
I told you to stop!

324
01:09:05,762 --> 01:09:08,757
What did you do?

325
01:09:08,829 --> 01:09:11,988
Get out! Get out of here!

326
01:09:13,334 --> 01:09:15,883
Get out! Get out of here!

327
01:09:15,953 --> 01:09:19,744
I'm talking to you. Get out.

328
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:30,553
Hit the Germans!

329
01:09:47,326 --> 01:09:50,898
Beat the Germans! Beat him!

330
01:10:02,405 --> 01:10:04,987
Beat the Germans!

331
01:10:39,817 --> 01:10:42,529
Stop, scoundrels.

332
01:10:46,429 --> 01:10:52,136
So what if he is German? He's
still a shoemaker like us.

333
01:11:36,843 --> 01:11:39,969
What do you want? You should disperse.

334
01:11:40,038 --> 01:11:42,816
Go, go.

335
01:11:57,609 --> 01:12:00,538
My Senka was killed.

336
01:12:18,822 --> 01:12:23,093
Take him to the bed. Move, move.

337
01:12:57,447 --> 01:13:03,101
He's not permitted to go out
anymore, since it causes a big ruckus.

338
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:05,170
Go away, go away.

339
01:13:05,243 --> 01:13:08,620
Pick him up.

340
01:13:30,641 --> 01:13:33,897
Anka, come home, you brat!

341
01:14:16,965 --> 01:14:20,537
I was knocked down...

342
01:14:20,607 --> 01:14:23,918
simply because I'm German.

343
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:28,426
Then a girl came,

344
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:31,624
she was nice to me.

345
01:14:31,693 --> 01:14:34,209
If it hadn't been for her,

346
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,578
they would have killed me.

347
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:39,671
Compatriots, have you heard?

348
01:15:41,403 --> 01:15:44,398
Our Tsar has abdicated.

349
01:15:44,470 --> 01:15:49,219
- You're lying.
- Who's lying?

350
01:15:50,603 --> 01:15:53,054
What a rush!

351
01:15:55,428 --> 01:15:58,456
What a rush!

352
01:16:26,736 --> 01:16:31,714
Brothers, friends, citizens...

353
01:16:31,784 --> 01:16:35,640
the rising sun of revolution

354
01:16:35,714 --> 01:16:38,327
has destroyed the tyranny.

355
01:16:38,397 --> 01:16:41,524
Hello, Alexander Feodorovich.

356
01:16:41,592 --> 01:16:44,305
I don't have time, I don't have time.

357
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:51,300
I greet you on behalf of
the Provisional Government.

358
01:16:51,368 --> 01:16:56,727
Free citizens of free Russia, hurrah!

359
01:17:05,233 --> 01:17:08,327
Now the Duma of people will govern.

360
01:17:15,042 --> 01:17:17,623
Duma...

361
01:17:33,379 --> 01:17:37,431
To hell with the Tsar.

362
01:17:41,174 --> 01:17:44,649
We can assume that there
will be no war anymore.

363
01:17:49,928 --> 01:17:54,078
We can assume that
from the landowners...

364
01:17:56,350 --> 01:17:58,616
the land...

365
01:18:07,532 --> 01:18:09,829
What a rush!

366
01:18:31,748 --> 01:18:34,493
War is over.

367
01:18:34,559 --> 01:18:37,140
The land will be...

368
01:19:46,761 --> 01:19:48,668
Attack.

369
01:19:50,595 --> 01:19:54,331
Well... okay, attack.

370
01:20:09,188 --> 01:20:12,347
Fire, fire!

371
01:21:14,681 --> 01:21:16,882
Brothers...

372
01:21:19,058 --> 01:21:22,980
when will this be over?

373
01:22:31,452 --> 01:22:33,935
Don't save me.

374
01:22:34,007 --> 01:22:38,473
I have a wife and child at home.

375
01:22:44,487 --> 01:22:47,329
I think he doesn't want to fight.

376
01:22:51,196 --> 01:22:53,908
No, he doesn't.

377
01:22:56,147 --> 01:23:01,408
Explain to me, my dear...
we don't want to fight,

378
01:23:01,483 --> 01:23:04,826
they don't want to fight,

379
01:23:04,901 --> 01:23:08,311
but still, this is the fourth
year that we've been fighting.

380
01:23:12,026 --> 01:23:15,729
Where are you going, Nikolai?

381
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:38,563
Let me talk.

382
01:24:38,636 --> 01:24:42,307
Every scoundrel, German agent,

383
01:24:42,374 --> 01:24:46,328
Bolshevik, spy and traitor,

384
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:50,037
is appealing for
fraternization on the front.

385
01:24:50,104 --> 01:24:55,147
At this very moment, when
the country, covered in blood,

386
01:24:55,216 --> 01:24:58,527
is fighting against
the external enemies,

387
01:24:58,603 --> 01:25:02,306
the Bolsheviks betray the Motherland.

388
01:25:02,373 --> 01:25:07,220
The Bolsheviks disintegrate the army.

389
01:25:07,293 --> 01:25:12,141
On behalf of the Provisional
Government, I declare...

390
01:25:12,212 --> 01:25:16,842
- Shoot those scoundrels!
- Don't disturb me, let me talk.

391
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:22,591
On behalf of the Provisional
Government, I declare,

392
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:25,786
with no mercy, we will destroy soldiers,

393
01:25:25,855 --> 01:25:29,841
traitors calling for fraternization

394
01:25:29,911 --> 01:25:34,279
and disintegration of the army.

395
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:48,212
Nikolai!

396
01:25:51,477 --> 01:25:53,481
Nikolai!

397
01:26:14,191 --> 01:26:17,055
Nikolai!

398
01:26:41,889 --> 01:26:48,109
Artillery, shoot the
traitor of the Motherland.

399
01:26:48,184 --> 01:26:50,319
Shoot!

400
01:27:52,558 --> 01:27:56,098
My dear Nikolai...

401
01:27:58,245 --> 01:28:06,513
Don't give rifles to the commanders.

402
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:09,710
Deputies, soldiers...

403
01:28:09,778 --> 01:28:13,002
the Winter Palace has been captured.

404
01:28:38,658 --> 01:28:40,662
Anka!

405
01:28:49,042 --> 01:28:51,242
Sit down and play!

406
01:29:33,704 --> 01:29:35,708
Stop!

407
01:29:35,781 --> 01:29:38,112
What's the matter?

408
01:29:39,168 --> 01:29:41,585
- We've arrived, get off.
- Go to hell!

409
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:45,070
- I told you, we've arrived!
- I won't get off.

410
01:29:45,142 --> 01:29:48,617
We kindly request you to get off.

411
01:29:54,151 --> 01:29:58,748
- I'm submitting to violence.
- As you should! Peter, arrest him!

412
01:30:43,095 --> 01:30:45,165
Get up.

413
01:30:45,235 --> 01:30:47,304
Get up.

414
01:30:47,376 --> 01:30:49,958
Get up, Kolya.

415
01:30:56,672 --> 01:30:59,189
Kolechka.

416
01:31:00,219 --> 01:31:02,735
Kolechka!

417
01:31:02,807 --> 01:31:04,811
Kolya.

418
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:11,905
- What do you want?
- Get up.

419
01:31:11,976 --> 01:31:14,176
Now.

420
01:31:28,653 --> 01:31:32,259
What a rush!

421
01:31:36,904 --> 01:31:41,199
THE END
