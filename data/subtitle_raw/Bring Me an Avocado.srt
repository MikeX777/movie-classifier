1
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,184
-  Okay.

2
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,686
Okay.

3
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:22,188
-  You ready for mine?

4
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,902
-  No growling,
it's gonna freak 'em out.

5
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,821
- Oh come on, a little spook

6
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,448
here and there builds character.

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,540
I could barely breathe in this thing.

8
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,668
-  You ready?

9
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,919
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,430
-  What was that?

11
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,657
- I want ice cream for breakfast too.

12
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:58,368
- Eh, maybe on your birthday.

13
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,202
Ready?

14
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,691
- Happy birthday baby.
- Thank you.

15
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,325
- You sure you got this?

16
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,121
- You go enjoy a relaxing day with Jada.

17
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,665
I'll make sure these mutants
get to where they need to be.

18
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,933
- Right on schedule.

19
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,143
Is she on her way?

20
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,644
- Sure is, boss.

21
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,730
And I've got my two partners here

22
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,231
skipping school to help daddy.

23
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,984
- Jada, it sounds like you're in the car!

24
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,277
- Hey little ladies.

25
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,987
I can't wait to see you guys tonight.

26
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,990
- Hey, you sure you got her
busy until five p.m., mamie?

27
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,242
- Who you think you talking to, papi?

28
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:22,869
- The car!

29
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,790
- All right, well then
I'll see you tonight, jefe.

30
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,130
Hey, Greecie!

31
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,968
- Don't call me that.

32
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,389
Hi sweeties, you two feeling party ready?

33
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,891
- They sure are.

34
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,059
- I can pick them up after school

35
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,227
in case you need some extra time

36
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,853
to figure out what to do with all this.

37
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,772
- Well, actually Greecie,

38
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,358
the girls are feeling sort of sick.

39
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,692
They've got a case of

40
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:57,153
I-wanna-plan-mommy's-birthday-itis.

41
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,240
- That's hardly a reason to skip school.

42
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,450
Careful George, in case
they don't get an education

43
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,660
they might turn out like you.

44
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,079
- Well actually, Greece bag, I didn't ask

45
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,747
for your permission now, did I?

46
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,332
But if you want you can check up on them

47
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,085
at around four p.m.
before the big surprise.

48
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,461
- I'm the princess!

49
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,171
- Bye Aunt Greecie.

50
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,050
- Hey, Greece bag, get excited!

51
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,177
This is a party you're
actually invited to.

52
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,058
-  Just rip it open.

53
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,519
-  No way, look at
how pretty the paper is.

54
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:30,937
- You're giving me anxiety.

55
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,689
I will bring you a whole roll later

56
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,524
if you just put me out of my misery.

57
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,609
- I'm almost done.

58
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,404
Oh I love these!

59
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,822
Thank you so much.

60
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,411
- So how's the book deal coming along?

61
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,580
-  Well, you have to have a book

62
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,915
to have a book deal.

63
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,125
We're gonna have to start buying

64
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,210
the cheaper toilet paper.

65
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,295
- Should I sound the alarm?

66
00:04:56,295 --> 00:04:58,506
- No, I trust him.

67
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,009
He's good at what he does.

68
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,552
I trust his process.

69
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,512
- And George always delivers.

70
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,389
- With a little help from his friends.

71
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,893
- I mean what kind of friend would I be

72
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,354
if I let you wipe your ass
with cheap toilet paper?

73
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,108
Just let me know if you ever need any.

74
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,069
- Thank you.

75
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:20,987
- Hey, I mean I can't let you have

76
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,115
toilet paper crumble all
on your booty cheeks.

77
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:24,949
- Oh.

78
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,828
Maybe it's time for me
to try something new.

79
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:54,771
- Woohoo!

80
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:55,605
I made it.

81
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,526
Happy birthday, my love.
- Thank you.

82
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,321
Oh whoah.

83
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,869
- Oh my god.

84
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,205
Why do they smell like that?

85
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,664
- Shut up.

86
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,750
- How long have you been
wearing those socks for?

87
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,962
- What was that for?

88
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,048
- A little holy water, disinfectant.

89
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,512
- Wow, woo woo!

90
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,263
Thank you.

91
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,358
Let's do karaoke.

92
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:41,234
- Yeah right.

93
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,360
You know I can't do that.

94
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,529
My babies are making me dinner.

95
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,156
- Well your biggest baby
should be throwing you a party.

96
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,242
He's had plenty of underemployment time

97
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,076
the last few months.

98
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,494
- Can I just pull the birthday card

99
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,620
and ask you to shut up?

100
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,040
- Yeah, drop it, Griselda.

101
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,625
- Thank you.

102
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,459
- Oh.

103
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,255
Thank ya, Jada.

104
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,007
- My treat.

105
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,718
- All right.

106
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:08,553
Sweet, thanks.

107
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,054
I start paying student loans next month so

108
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,764
it's going straight in the piggy bank.

109
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,598
- Okay.

110
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,267
- Are you sure you don't wanna come over?

111
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:15,101
- No.

112
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,105
- I'm having a beer for dinner.

113
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,650
- Well thank you for today, my loves.

114
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,485
- Hey, cheers!

115
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:26,946
- Yup.

116
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,496
- Oscar-worthy?

117
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,706
- Overkill.

118
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,001
Now, let's go see if George
knows how to throw a party.

119
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,363
- Shh, shh, shh.

120
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:14,368
Shh, shh ,shh ,shh.

121
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:15,453
- Baby, baby.

122
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,455
- Hey babe, I'm less than a minute away.

123
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,749
- Less than a minute away?

124
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:24,295
Oh baby I failed, you're
gonna beat us home.

125
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,380
Just stay out of the kitchen, okay?

126
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,382
The girls worked so hard on dinner,

127
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,676
they'll hate you if you don't wait.

128
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,969
- Okay.

129
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,346
I love you too.

130
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,639
See you soon, bye.

131
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:44,815
-  Keep walking.

132
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:45,775
- Okay.

133
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,235
- What you got on you?

134
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,570
- I have my wallet and
my keys and my cellphone.

135
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,947
I don't have any cash,
you can take everything.

136
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:53,783
- Shh.

137
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,617
-  Bet you got more at home.

138
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,451
- My family will be home any minute.

139
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,661
I have two little girls, please!

140
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:01,666
- Hurry!

141
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,962
-  Surprise!

142
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:22,455
- Is there any update?

143
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,373
- No, you know I can't tell you

144
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,751
until you fill out some of
this paperwork first, okay?

145
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,044
You have to have been
registered, we need you to--

146
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,754
- But do we know anything else?

147
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,714
Do we know when she's gonna wake up?

148
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,716
What's happening, is she out of surgery?

149
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,426
- The doctors are doing
the best they can, okay?

150
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,178
There's nothing I can tell you right now

151
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:39,680
other than we're taking
good care of her, okay?

152
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,640
And I need you to fill this out for me.

153
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,076
- So she's out of surgery.

154
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,952
She did lose quite a lot of blood.

155
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,080
As of right now we have
her in intensive care,

156
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,124
we're watching her very closely.

157
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:10,503
But as of right now, I'm
afraid she is in a coma.

158
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,972
- And now what?

159
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,391
-  We wait.

160
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,475
I'm very sorry.

161
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,565
-  All right.

162
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,110
Call me if you need anything.

163
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,160
- You sure you don't want me to stay?

164
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:24,994
- What?

165
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,165
-  Do you want me to stay?

166
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,126
- No, no.

167
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:36,088
We have to keep a strong
front for the girls.

168
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,049
They need to know that
she's coming right back,

169
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,468
no big deal.

170
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,928
Yeah, but I'll see you all
at the hospital tomorrow.

171
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,640
Yeah, yeah, okay?

172
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,142
Business as usual around here.

173
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,478
All right?

174
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:52,480
Yeah.

175
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,196
- Hey, you need a ride?

176
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,239
- Yeah, that'd be great, thanks.

177
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:37,483
Oh my god.

178
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,753
Thanks for the ride.

179
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,841
- Thanks for the company.

180
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,691
- You scared us with the loud music!

181
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,650
-  That's so mean.

182
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,818
- Breakfast time, baby.

183
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,654
We've got a lot to do today.

184
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,449
Today we're gonna go

185
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,993
decorate mom's hospital room.

186
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,162
Yeah, we're gonna grab
everything we can think of

187
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,038
that she would want over there

188
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,290
that would remind her of home.

189
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,167
That way when she wakes up she feels safe

190
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,251
and thinks of us.

191
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,587
Right away, okay?

192
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,421
- Okay!

193
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,632
- Ready, set,

194
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,716
- Go, go, go!

195
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,257
-  Jesus.

196
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:08,467
What's wrong?

197
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,802
- I can't sleep.

198
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,346
- Why is that?

199
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,807
- 'Cause of what if we
get shot like mommy?

200
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:18,227
- I'm gonna stay awake

201
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:23,023
until I'm sure that everyone
in the world is asleep

202
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,777
and no one is awake to
even think about it, okay?

203
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,904
- Will you come sleep with us?

204
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,283
- I'll tell you what.

205
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,411
I still have to vacuum the house

206
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,539
but I'll come check on
you when I'm done, okay?

207
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,042
- Okay.
- All right.

208
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,175
Oh, okay.

209
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,428
Okay.

210
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,475
And if you're still awake

211
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,686
I'll crawl in bed with both of you, okay?

212
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,187
- Okay.

213
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,022
- Okay.

214
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,859
Love you.
- I love you too.

215
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,202
- Okay.

216
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,455
Okay, okay, okay.

217
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,340
- Isabel, why don't you come here

218
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,842
and eat your pancakes at the table, mama.

219
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,345
-  I wanna sit on the couch.

220
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,765
- Okay, well if you get
any syrup on that couch

221
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:21,350
you're cleaning it.

222
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,518
- Nuh-uh.

223
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,477
- Yes-huh.

224
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,105
And not just the syrupy
spot, the entire couch.

225
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:30,150
- I can't, it's too big.

226
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,319
- Well I guess you better
find a carwash or something.

227
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,488
- That'll take too long.

228
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,323
- Well I'm not gonna help you.

229
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,742
So I guess you better get down here

230
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,078
and eat your pancakes at the table.

231
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,996
- Well look who arrived to bully my girls

232
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,456
early in the morning.

233
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,833
I'm glad you're here, buddy.

234
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,046
Hey, princess, you wanna
share your pancakes with me?

235
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,256
You can sit on my lap,

236
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,675
that way it doesn't
count as the couch, yeah?

237
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,219
-  You're the worst.

238
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,427
- Oh fuck!

239
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,096
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

240
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,974
Girls!

241
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,017
Up, up, up, up!

242
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:45,851
We're late, we're late!

243
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:46,685
Late, late, late, late!

244
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,978
Come on, come on, come on!

245
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:48,812
Let's go!

246
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:49,646
- Ow!

247
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,899
- Dad!

248
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:52,733
- Matilda!

249
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,026
- I have a test today.

250
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,444
Oh my god, I forgot!

251
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,866
- There we go.

252
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,826
-  It's too tight!

253
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,912
- All right, this one, this
one. Hey, hey, no, no, no, no.

254
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,913
Here we go.

255
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,747
All right.

256
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,625
- This one's too itchy, I hate this one.

257
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,002
- Pick whatever you want.

258
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,130
Perfect, perfect.

259
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,590
Yeah yeah yeah, come on, come on, come on.

260
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,008
All right, let's get out of here.

261
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,511
- I watched movies all day
yesterday like an idiot!

262
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,346
- Hey, don't call

263
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,347
yourself that.
- Oh my god,

264
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,598
I'm gonna fail.

265
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,936
Hey, that's my shirt.

266
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,146
- Daddy said that I could wear it.

267
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,230
- Matty, just this time.

268
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,358
-  Well I didn't, so take it off!

269
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,359
- No!

270
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,234
- Dad!

271
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,945
- Sweetheart, I'll buy you five more

272
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,529
exactly the same, okay?

273
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,492
- I'm not going because
Matilda is a meanie.

274
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,618
-  I don't have
to let you borrow it

275
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,535
if I don't want to.

276
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,621
- I don't have to like
you if I don't want to.

277
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:50,165
- Enough, yes you do and yes you do!

278
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,124
- You're a meanie.

279
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,167
- Go away.

280
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,001
I'm trying to study.

281
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,087
- And a dummy.

282
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:56,880
- Girls!

283
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,467
I think it's best that they
stay home with me today.

284
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,844
It's too soon.

285
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,473
We need a little decompressing time.

286
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,476
Yeah.

287
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,020
Thanks, Greecie.

288
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,944
Good breakfast?

289
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,071
- Yeah.

290
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,637
- Isabel, Matilda.

291
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,680
Up up.

292
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,057
Come on, girls, school.

293
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:53,520
-  Five more minutes.

294
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,604
- Five, okay?

295
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,065
Scoot.

296
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,818
Scoot, sweety.

297
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,746
Oops.

298
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,507
-  Can you give me reggae, Popeye?

299
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,383
- Here.

300
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:24,217
- Mmm.

301
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:28,638
Thanks, sweety.

302
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,639
So generous.

303
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,685
-  And who's gonna make me?

304
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,815
- Did you know your mom
hates getting flowers?

305
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,902
Let me tell you a little story.

306
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:44,237
So one year your mom is playing

307
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,910
Susie Snowflake in our Christmas musical.

308
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,329
Your dad over here, he shows up

309
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:56,750
with a big beautiful
bouquet of sunflowers.

310
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,420
Your mom sees them

311
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:06,885
and she is horrified.

312
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,431
But your dad's not a quitter.

313
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,643
So he shows up again on closing night.

314
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,560
But this time,

315
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:20,107
he has a basket of avocados.

316
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,527
- Avocados?
- Yeah.

317
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,320
- Flowers are prettier.

318
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,490
- Yeah but your mom loved her avocados.

319
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,867
- She takes the avocados

320
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:36,248
and falls deeply in love with your dad.

321
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,419
- We made beautiful guacamole that night.

322
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,962
- Daddy.
- I bet you did.

323
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,843
- When's mom gonna wake up?

324
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,012
-  Any day now.

325
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,598
- But how do you know?

326
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,477
- I just know.

327
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,729
I can feel it.

328
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,066
-  I miss her.

329
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,991
- I'm gonna go get some napkins.

330
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,328
- I miss her too.

331
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:27,340
- Dad?

332
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,635
I had fun today.

333
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,388
- Good, baby.

334
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:36,725
- Is it okay to have fun?

335
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,979
- Baby do you think your
mom would want to hear

336
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,856
that you had a fun day

337
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,566
or that you had a sad day?

338
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,151
- A fun day!

339
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,402
- That's right.

340
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,821
We have to have as much fun as we can

341
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,406
and stay positive

342
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,034
so we have all sorts of good stories

343
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,452
for mommy when she wakes up.

344
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,084
I love you both with all my heart.

345
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,192
- Hello, George, Matilda!

346
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,123
All right, that's perfect.

347
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:47,128
And, as a final special touch,

348
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,382
a magical butterfly!

349
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,175
There you go.

350
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,805
Perfect, let's see what you look like.

351
00:25:56,805 --> 00:26:00,308
You look so pretty.

352
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,518
All right, you good?

353
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,769
Yeah, let's go.

354
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,359
Ugh, you have any idea how much

355
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,028
high fructose corn syrup
are in these things?

356
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,780
- What's high fructose corn syrup?

357
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,448
- It's something people talk about

358
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,492
to make other people unhappy.

359
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,536
- It's what your dad's
love handles are made of.

360
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,379
- All right babe, you made your point.

361
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,422
You can wake up now.

362
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,008
I'm getting a little mad about this

363
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,384
negative attention-seeking.

364
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,705
All right, then.

365
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,166
Call me when you wake up.

366
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:17,821
- Good morning!

367
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,027
-  Please, please, please.

368
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,739
Please stay, please.

369
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,115
- Come on.

370
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,074
- Please, pretty pretty pretty,

371
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:03,992
please.
- Well?

372
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,744
- Well, it's okay with me

373
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,664
if the three of you
wanna have a sleepover.

374
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,749
- Woohoo!

375
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,375
- But I need to get some sleep tonight.

376
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,920
I need to get some work done tomorrow.

377
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,172
- Woo!

378
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,007
- Party, party, party!

379
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,427
-  Party, party!

380
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,697
- Whoah.

381
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,531
Hey.

382
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,577
My goodness, look at you.

383
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,995
- Oh, I was just gonna tell you.

384
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,830
I'm taking the girls to school today.

385
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,250
And if it's okay with you,

386
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,503
I was gonna take them on
an after school girls trip.

387
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,131
- Sure, sure.

388
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:03,968
All right, well you three have fun.

389
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,387
I'll see you girls later.

390
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,222
Give me kisses.

391
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,314
Hello?

392
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:00,817
Yes, this is he.

393
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,278
What?

394
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,572
Yeah, yeah.

395
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,074
I'll be there as soon as I can.

396
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,625
That's him.

397
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,755
-  We need you to
fill out some paperwork

398
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:23,631
before you leave.

399
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,061
- I'm sorry.

400
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,777
- Let's go.

401
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,477
- Dad?

402
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,020
- Jesus.

403
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,148
I didn't think you were home, sweety.

404
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:45,982
I'm sorry.

405
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,067
- What happened?

406
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,652
- I dropped a glass.

407
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,696
Don't come any closer
with your socks, okay,

408
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,740
you're gonna cut yourself.

409
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,324
- Greece brought us home early

410
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,617
to get a start on dinner.

411
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,953
- Thank you, sweetheart.

412
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,581
- Are you okay?

413
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,041
- I am.

414
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,461
Are you okay?

415
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,506
I'm sorry I scared you Matty.

416
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:14,010
I know the last thing we
need is being spooked.

417
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,929
- I'm okay.

418
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,764
- Okay.

419
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,504
- Whoops.

420
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:52,590
For you!

421
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,308
- Oh my little girl!

422
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:12,693
So you're helping a lot, huh?

423
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,794
I know it might be a surprise to you

424
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,130
but I've been alone with my kids before.

425
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:35,842
- Okay.

426
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,180
- I appreciate you making dinner.

427
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,890
I know that your heart's
in the right place.

428
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:43,891
- Can you just swallow your pride

429
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,184
and let me make dinner in peace?

430
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:45,977
- Pride?

431
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,979
This isn't a pride thing.

432
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,314
Come on, you can barely
take care of yourself.

433
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,238
- She's my sister. I need to
make sure the girls are okay.

434
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,072
- Greece!

435
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,157
I don't want to have
dinner with you, that's it!

436
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,540
Hey, what happened?

437
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,749
Are you okay?

438
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:12,795
- I killed the bees, I'm a killer.

439
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,922
Mommy would be so mad.

440
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,716
- No, no, no, no she wouldn't.

441
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,175
No she wouldn't, sweetheart.

442
00:36:18,175 --> 00:36:19,010
Come here.

443
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,014
It's a mistake.

444
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:23,890
It's just a mistake, okay?

445
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,224
It was a mistake.

446
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,227
You didn't do anything wrong.

447
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,157
Lord, may these bees have a home

448
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,575
to arrive to in heaven.

449
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,579
May there be many flowers
surrounding their hive

450
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:50,333
and may they make honey
if it makes them happy.

451
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:54,086
- Amen.

452
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,380
- Amen.

453
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:20,947
- I forget you know all the same stuff,

454
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:23,741
grew up in the same house

455
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:25,785
and buried the same roadkill.

456
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,828
- Our mom was a firm believer

457
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,414
that every animal deserved
a death of dignity.

458
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,833
She cried at every burial.

459
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,295
Her words were always so beautiful.

460
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,257
- Well I'm glad you were here.

461
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,302
Thank you.

462
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,178
- You're welcome.

463
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,890
- And, I'm sorry.

464
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,228
- It's okay.

465
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,815
- Hey babe, how you been?

466
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,111
Ah, really, that's great.

467
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:48,284
You know I really wish you'd
start thinkin' about waking up.

468
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,203
Matilda's smoking meth again.

469
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,289
Isabel's pregnant.

470
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,749
- What, nobody sleeps in on Sundays?

471
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,542
- Good morning, bumeroo.

472
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,420
Can I help you with any homework

473
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,546
after brunch, Matilda?

474
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,256
- Nah, I'll do it tonight.

475
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,258
Dad and I are gonna go play some soccer.

476
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,093
- Yeah.

477
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,260
- Maybe we can save the play

478
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,762
for after we finish your homework.

479
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,596
-  Okay.

480
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,807
- Hey, you don't have to do
what she tells you, sweetheart.

481
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,350
I'm the boss around here.

482
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,768
- It's the last week of school, right?

483
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,311
You can play soccer all summer.

484
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,522
Will it kill you to finish
your homework first now?

485
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,356
- No.

486
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:01,899
- Yeah, that's right
baby, it won't kill you

487
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,150
so you might as well do it.

488
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,071
But that's an unreasonable
decision making tactic.

489
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,573
You shouldn't do something
because it won't kill you.

490
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,407
- Here he goes.

491
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,201
- If your Aunt Greecie ate dog food

492
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,828
it wouldn't kill her.

493
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,246
- Yeah, that's true.

494
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,665
I mean we all eat your
cooking, we're still alive.

495
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,628
- Well come on girls, come on.

496
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:27,758
Goal!

497
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,069
- Hey, can I join in?

498
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,195
- Yeah.
- Sure thing, Captain.

499
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,363
- Be on my team, Jada.

500
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,991
- But only if you convince Isabel to play.

501
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,159
Yeah, you baby.

502
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,035
Yeah, come on.
- Come on, Izzy.

503
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:55,870
Come on Izzy.

504
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,829
Izzy!

505
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,622
We could play your dad three to one.

506
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,880
- All right.

507
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,922
He's running with the ball.

508
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,007
Aw!

509
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,511
Ah, no!

510
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,354
Oh, corazon!

511
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:24,481
Yeah, woo!

512
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,905
Go, go, score the goal!

513
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,947
-  Score the goal!

514
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,700
- Ah, ah, go, get it, get it, get it!

515
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,245
But you're tiny, you can get that.

516
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:41,040
What, ah ah ah!

517
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,041
Goal!

518
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,834
Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal.

519
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:44,668
Ay!

520
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,546
- I'm a fast little girl!

521
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,964
- Over here!

522
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,424
Over here, pass it to me!

523
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,676
Pass it to me before I die.

524
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,808
We scored, right?

525
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,726
Yeah, yeah.

526
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:03,270
Oh boy.

527
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:18,619
- Can I help you?

528
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,832
- Go inside.

529
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,959
- Go inside, girls.

530
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,088
George?

531
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,800
- Go inside, go inside.

532
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,137
- Whoah, whoah.
- George?

533
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,180
George!

534
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,765
George, what are you doing?

535
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,476
- Oh shit!
- Wait, what are you doing?!

536
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,520
George, George!

537
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,688
Stop, stop it!

538
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,983
Stop, stop, let him go.

539
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,317
Stop it, George.

540
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,239
You're all right.

541
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,451
It's okay man, chill!

542
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,286
Chill.

543
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,542
It's okay.

544
00:43:09,586 --> 00:43:10,379
It's okay.

545
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:15,926
Just breathe.

546
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:20,931
It's okay.

547
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,242
- What do you think my
dad said to those boys?

548
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,328
- Probably just told them to beat it.

549
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,038
- So embarrassing.

550
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,124
- A good dad's job is to be embarrassing.

551
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,878
- Why didn't you play?

552
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,213
- I'm more of a theater kid.

553
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,091
You know, sports were
never really my thing.

554
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,760
- My mom plays.

555
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:58,844
Hmm, played.

556
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,099
She was coaching me for soccer tryouts

557
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,477
and now I'm not gonna make it to the team.

558
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,521
- I bet Jada can coach
you until she wakes up.

559
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,689
- That's okay.

560
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:11,774
- Why not?

561
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:13,692
She's a way better player
than your mom anyway.

562
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,610
- Don't say that.

563
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,903
- Why?

564
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,655
Matty, you know I love
your mom with all my heart.

565
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,325
You know what?

566
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,159
- What?

567
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,244
- She's not a very good player.

568
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:26,121
She lived on the bench.

569
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,123
We used to go watch her
play when I was younger

570
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,416
just to be sitting on different benches

571
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,834
watching the other kids play.

572
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,135
Matty, you can't put your life on hold

573
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,012
until she wakes up.

574
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,389
You gotta keep doing the best you can

575
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,599
and being the happiest you can be

576
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,768
so you have stories to
tell her later, okay?

577
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:56,193
- It's just that I'm so
scared she's gonna die.

578
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,659
- Your mom's strong.

579
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,746
I've got all my money on her.

580
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:14,002
She's not going anywhere, okay?

581
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:19,550
Come here.

582
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,733
- Thanks.

583
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:46,076
Thank you for everything.

584
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,457
-  You're losing it, man.

585
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,753
- Yeah I'm fucked.

586
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,256
- No.
- Yeah.

587
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,633
- No, you're not.
- I don't know.

588
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,677
- Look, you're gonna be fine.

589
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:06,138
And Robin's going to be
here before you know it.

590
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:11,101
But in the meantime, you
need to control yourself

591
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:13,479
because she's not here
to bail you out of jail.

592
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,443
- You'll come through.

593
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,531
Huh?

594
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,369
- Yeah, I always do, don't I?

595
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:32,998
- Must be my charm.

596
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:40,130
- If anybody can get by on charm alone

597
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,673
it is definitely you.

598
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,010
- No, if I get by, I get by

599
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,262
because I'm Robin's husband.

600
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,931
You take that off the table and

601
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,309
there's not much left.

602
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:56,813
- Just hang in there, buddy.

603
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,148
She's on the way, I know it.

604
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,191
- Yeah, yeah.

605
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,361
Yeah.

606
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,240
- What's going on out here?

607
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,662
- Well, it's been a pretty full night.

608
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,790
Bedtime for me.

609
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,334
Good night, ladies.

610
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,003
- Actually, do you mind if I stick around

611
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,380
and go through Robin's closet?

612
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,508
I need to borrow something for a dress.

613
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:25,467
-  Seriously?

614
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:27,844
- What?

615
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,638
She's not dead, I can borrow something

616
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,056
from my sleeping sister.

617
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,893
-  Whatever.

618
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:40,983
- Good night.

619
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:05,090
- Thanks for taking the girls.

620
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,550
- Of course, of course.

621
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,887
- Could have been bad.

622
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,098
- Let's not talk about it.

623
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,858
- That one's one of my favorites.

624
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,575
- I know she loves
Robin and she means well

625
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:37,414
but I just feel like Robin
wouldn't feel very comfortable

626
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:42,419
with you and Jada drinking
late at night on her porch.

627
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:49,176
- You think she'd feel
comfortable with you and I

628
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,970
picking through her closet
together late at night?

629
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,978
It's all circumstances, game-changer.

630
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,064
It wouldn't be happening if she were here.

631
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,862
- Got anything stronger than beer?

632
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,532
- Okay, come on.

633
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,308
-  George.

634
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:24,021
- Bron?

635
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:24,855
-  George.

636
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:30,694
- Jesus fucking Christ,
Greece, take that off.

637
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,489
- Oh, George, did I really scare you?

638
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:39,161
Sorry.

639
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,052
- George.

640
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:58,847
This is the worst thing you
can be doing for yourself.

641
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,475
- Did you sleep in your clothes?

642
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,350
Ew!

643
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,436
- Yeah, ew.

644
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,979
- You slept in your clothes too?

645
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,939
What's wrong with you people?

646
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,858
- All right, one last kiss, princess.

647
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,529
You too, grouchy pants.

648
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,323
I'll spend some time with you later, okay?

649
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,157
- Okay.

650
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,283
- Special date.

651
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,117
- Okay.

652
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,368
-  See you three later.

653
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:21,453
-  Bye.

654
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,917
- Can one of you go ask Jada

655
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,210
if she's making breakfast.

656
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,295
- Kay.

657
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,557
- Doesn't she look pretty?

658
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,769
- You look very pretty, mommy.

659
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,771
- She can't hear you.

660
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,523
- Hey, we don't know that.

661
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,567
We don't know if she can hear us or not.

662
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,736
We might as well talk to her,

663
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,947
not about her.

664
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,740
Just in case she can, right?

665
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,285
You look very pretty, my love.

666
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:09,751
Hey why don't you tell mom about the game?

667
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:13,004
- Dad beat up some kid across the street.

668
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,714
- No, no, no, no, not that part.

669
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,800
No, don't listen to her babe, she's drunk.

670
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:19,845
- Okay, one more and you're all set.

671
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,763
- Matilda!

672
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,267
Where's your sister?

673
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,354
If you find her before
she steals everything

674
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,689
we'll all get ice cream.

675
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:31,523
- On it.

676
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,414
What are you doing?

677
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:50,375
- Nothing, nosy Rosie, go away!

678
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:53,962
- Isabel.

679
00:52:53,962 --> 00:52:55,589
- Leave it, it's for mommy

680
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,049
for when she's hungry if she wakes up!

681
00:52:58,049 --> 00:53:00,594
She likes them, remember?

682
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,054
- Isabel, I don't think
this is a good idea.

683
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,473
Mommy might not wake up for a long time.

684
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,059
- How long?

685
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:10,020
- No, don't cry.

686
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,938
Don't cry, I mean like

687
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,983
avocados go bad really fast, right?

688
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,902
Yeah, like in one day.

689
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:19,946
So if mommy doesn't wake
up till after tomorrow

690
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:22,949
she's gonna think you
left her a rotten avocado.

691
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,492
- It will rot?

692
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,037
- Yup, really fast.

693
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,581
But I promise, right when she wakes up

694
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:31,666
we'll bring one for her, okay?

695
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,500
- Okay.

696
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,755
- Hey, dad said we're getting ice cream

697
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,089
on the way home.

698
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:39,090
- Ice cream!

699
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,305
- Wanna share it?

700
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:50,060
- Hand holding?

701
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,020
Maybe we'll even get some cookies.

702
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,648
Gimme a kiss.

703
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,690
Ay, cara, get here!

704
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:02,948
-  Daddy, stop it!

705
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,366
- George, Matilda.

706
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:06,826
Matilda.

707
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:16,378
Where are they?

708
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,138
- We made it through another day.

709
00:54:27,138 --> 00:54:28,765
- Don't trip on your way in there.

710
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,600
- Bye, Jada.

711
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,434
- Bye, shorty.

712
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,158
- No, it's fine, it's totally fine.

713
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,745
We will just eat these tomorrow.

714
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,752
I just wish someone would
have called me first, but,

715
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:58,920
it's totally cool.

716
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:40,962
- Of course.

717
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,024
Whoah, whoah, whoah.

718
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:01,983
What are you doing?

719
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,109
-  Hey, what's going on?

720
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,652
- What are you doing, J?

721
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,404
- I've been just
organizing your bookshelf.

722
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,655
- What was wrong with it?

723
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,369
- I just noticed it was a little messy.

724
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:15,246
- Messy because Robin likes it messy.

725
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,124
She spends hours and hours making it messy

726
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:20,460
because that's how she fucking likes it.

727
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,212
She likes to stack things differently

728
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:25,131
and have them sticking out
because that's how she likes it.

729
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,759
- George, I'm sorry, I didn't realize.

730
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,427
I can put it back.

731
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:31,679
- What were you gonna do, rearrange them

732
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:34,015
by height and color code them?

733
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:34,933
Why?

734
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:35,850
- George, I'm sorry.
- Why?

735
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:37,352
- I was just trying--
- What are you gonna do,

736
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,686
her closet next?

737
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,897
- Jesus George, I'm sorry.

738
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,023
I was just trying to help.

739
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:43,900
- What, doesn't anybody call anymore?

740
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,152
Doesn't anybody fucking knock?

741
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,489
Nobody fucking cares about
personal space or alone time?

742
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,323
- Wait, okay.

743
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,407
- No, it's a fucking free for all!

744
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:52,367
- What the hell are you

745
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:53,284
talking about?
- My life!

746
00:56:53,284 --> 00:56:55,328
My personal private life!

747
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:57,247
- Don't talk to me like that.

748
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,081
I was just trying to

749
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,958
help out around here.
- Dammit, it's smothering!

750
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,919
I can't even spend a
fucking second by myself.

751
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,504
I can't even have a fucking moment

752
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:06,256
with my own goddamn kids!

753
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,133
- Whoah, I love your kids.

754
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,884
And I just don't want
them to feel the imbalance

755
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:10,718
of Robin being gone.

756
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,845
- But what, do you think that I've

757
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,930
never spent time with them alone?

758
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,141
What, you think that I replace Robin

759
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,434
every time she leaves the house?

760
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,060
No, I'm their fucking dad!

761
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,228
- I didn't know you felt like that.

762
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:21,271
It's just been nothing but
fun and games around here.

763
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,189
- What are we even fighting about?

764
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,899
The kids aren't even here.

765
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,276
The kids aren't here.

766
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,527
So why don't you just leave?

767
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,612
Look, I get it, I get it that you love 'em

768
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:32,449
but just fucking leave and
come back when they come back.

769
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,958
Ah, Jada wait, ah fuck,

770
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,877
I'm such a fucking asshole.

771
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,421
I'm sorry.

772
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,255
- Fuck you, George.

773
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,675
I thought you wanted me here.

774
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,307
You don't get to feel sorry

775
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:59,350
after hurting my feelings.

776
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,227
You're fucking insane, you know that?

777
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,188
- Look, I do, I do want you here.

778
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,981
Just not all the time, okay?

779
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,941
And yeah, yeah I'm not myself.

780
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,945
I'm not thinking straight anymore.

781
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,030
I've lost my mind.

782
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,201
I haven't settled.

783
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,496
- Well, fucking settle.

784
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,967
- I do want you here.

785
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:37,722
I do want you here.

786
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,265
I do want you here.

787
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:44,521
I do want you here.

788
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,396
- George.

789
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,731
-  I do.

790
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,944
I want you here.

791
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:10,838
- Hey Robbie.

792
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,468
I keep thinking the more often I come

793
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,095
the better chances I have of being here

794
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:17,929
when you wake up.

795
00:59:25,561 --> 00:59:27,647
The girls are doing good.

796
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,858
We're all hanging in there.

797
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,544
Got you these.

798
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:52,005
Figured in case we're not here

799
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:52,964
when you wake up,

800
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,467
you won't have to wake
up to these ugly things.

801
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,739
This really sucks, Robbie.

802
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,498
This really sucks.

803
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:34,273
-  Dad, let us in, I have to pee.

804
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:41,572
- Hey.
- Get in there, go, go, go.

805
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:43,533
- Hey.

806
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,785
-  I've got mac and cheese.

807
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,203
- Mac and cheese.

808
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,956
- Let's drink whiskey.

809
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,667
- Not tonight, Greece.

810
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,421
I really need to read all
the shit that I wrote today,

811
01:01:56,421 --> 01:02:00,216
make sure this book
doesn't sound like I feel.

812
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,301
- Why don't you read to me?

813
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:03,219
Seriously.

814
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,638
I just spent a 14 hour day with two kids.

815
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,348
I could use some adult time.

816
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,142
And I'm a great listener.

817
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,187
- All right.

818
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:15,690
But I wanna make it clear

819
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,943
that I don't want your feedback.

820
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,541
You still with me?

821
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,419
That's about as far as I've got

822
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,464
before the story starts skipping around.

823
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,215
You know, a lot of gaps to fill.

824
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:43,009
- It's great, George.

825
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,469
- Yeah?

826
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,513
Well I'm glad you think so.

827
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:50,725
It's nice to hear it through your ears

828
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:54,145
and get a sense of your reactions.

829
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,898
- Martina is an asskicker.

830
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:57,732
- Ah yeah.

831
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,902
She has a lot of your sister in her.

832
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:04,447
I have one hell of a muse.

833
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:06,741
- You sure do.

834
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:14,999
- Greece, what are you doing?

835
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,710
- What do you mean?

836
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:26,385
- Look, I think you're
a little drunk right now

837
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,596
and if you want, you can stay the night

838
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,349
but I'm gonna go to bed now.
- What are you talking about?

839
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:34,060
- This footsy leg thing you're doing.

840
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:34,894
- Wait, what?

841
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,648
It wasn't sexual, if that's
what you're thinking.

842
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,482
What, you think I'm hitting on you?

843
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:42,401
- No, Greece, I'm not saying that, okay?

844
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:47,406
But whatever this, whatever this thing is,

845
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:51,077
it's not what we've ever been together.

846
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,997
It just doesn't feel right.

847
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,707
- I can't control whatever nasty thoughts

848
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:58,000
are going on in your head

849
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,961
but you're not gonna pin this on me like

850
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,712
it's something I did.

851
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,245
- What's for lunch?

852
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:00,539
- PB and Js.

853
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:04,210
- Ugh, I don't want that.

854
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:11,008
Daddy, I don't want that!

855
01:06:11,008 --> 01:06:12,843
- Well that's what you're getting ,sweety.

856
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,388
- Why?

857
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,431
- Because I don't have
time to cook, sweetheart.

858
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,683
Dad has to work.

859
01:06:18,683 --> 01:06:20,935
- We can call Jada to come cook for us.

860
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,478
- No.

861
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:23,479
- Why not?

862
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,648
- Because it's disrespectful to call her

863
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:27,650
just to come over and cook for us.

864
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,653
And it's Saturday, she has plans.

865
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:32,029
- How do you know?

866
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,322
What about Aunt Greecie?

867
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,327
- We're not calling Greece or Jada.

868
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,039
We're having PB and Js, that's that.

869
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,457
Am I clear?

870
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,167
- We don't want to stay and eat sammies.

871
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,669
It's boring!

872
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:47,878
- Why can't they just come pick us up?

873
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:49,588
- Because I say so!

874
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,341
And because your mother's in the hospital

875
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:55,302
and this isn't a vacation, okay?

876
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:56,554
You don't get to party everyday

877
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,681
because your mom's in a coma!

878
01:06:58,681 --> 01:07:00,307
Now have a little respect!

879
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:06,230
- Sorry, Daddy.

880
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:13,446
- No, I'm sorry, sweety.

881
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,410
I'm sorry.

882
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,244
I'm sorry.

883
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,081
I'm sorry.

884
01:07:38,929 --> 01:07:40,264
What you doing there, Izzy?

885
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,142
- Just dancing.

886
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:46,479
- Just dancing?

887
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,022
Ah, you know I think I hear it.

888
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,236
- No!

889
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,364
- No.

890
01:07:57,364 --> 01:07:59,074
- No, I know, I know.

891
01:07:59,074 --> 01:08:00,409
Of course it's not that one.

892
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:01,786
I know it's not that one.

893
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,372
It's this one.

894
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:09,919
- No.

895
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,004
No.

896
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:12,963
- I know, I'm sorry.

897
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,799
I'm just trying to confuse you guys.

898
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:37,863
Hello?

899
01:08:37,863 --> 01:08:38,697
-  Hey.

900
01:08:40,741 --> 01:08:42,993
- Hey, I just put the girls down,

901
01:08:42,993 --> 01:08:43,828
do you think we might be able--

902
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:45,079
-  I'm outside, George.

903
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:50,918
- Of course.

904
01:08:50,918 --> 01:08:51,836
Of course you are.

905
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,297
All right, I'll be out in a minute.

906
01:09:14,441 --> 01:09:15,276
Hey.

907
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,243
- I'm sorry.

908
01:09:26,787 --> 01:09:28,122
- It's as much my fault.

909
01:09:32,793 --> 01:09:34,086
I'm not in a good place.

910
01:09:37,631 --> 01:09:39,049
I love her with all my heart

911
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,136
and she's not gone, she's not gone.

912
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:48,767
- I love her too.

913
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:56,192
- Come here.

914
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:20,674
- God, them.

915
01:10:32,519 --> 01:10:34,480
- But I think we're gonna be okay now.

916
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:37,483
Hey.

917
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,946
You're still my bro, J.

918
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,324
- Well, that's a relief.

919
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:51,413
I'm gonna give it a few days before

920
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,915
I come pick up the girls.

921
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:58,420
- Yeah, a little breathing
room would be good, yeah.

922
01:10:58,420 --> 01:10:59,880
- Yeah.

923
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,967
- All right well, see you later, champ.

924
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,262
-  You got it, slugger.

925
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,028
- Hey, what are you doing?

926
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:24,154
- Why?
- Hey.

927
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:25,280
- Why?!
- Hey.

928
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:26,615
Hey, hey.
- Why, why?

929
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,200
Tell me why!
- Hey, hey!

930
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,243
The kids!

931
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:31,704
What are you, fucking insane?
- Fucking cheater!

932
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:32,997
- What?

933
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,249
-  You fucked Jada.

934
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,502
- You don't know what
you're talking about.

935
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:47,678
Jesus, Greece!

936
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:54,601
-  Dad?

937
01:11:54,601 --> 01:11:56,687
Dad, it's the hospital!

938
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,938
Mom's awake!

939
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,487
- Matilda, get your sister.

940
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:07,448
-  Get up, Izzie, mom woke up!

941
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:16,373
-  She's awake, let's go see her!

942
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:19,710
- Fuck!

943
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:29,887
Fuck!

944
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:36,769
- Hold it.

945
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,313
We have to be gentle with mommy.

946
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:40,606
- It's okay.

947
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:43,317
Come here, my sweethearts,
I wanna hold you so bad.

948
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:51,325
Ah, my babies.

949
01:12:51,325 --> 01:12:52,951
My beautiful little girls.

950
01:12:55,537 --> 01:12:56,372
Come here.

951
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:06,507
- Are you looking at me with
those big eyes of yours?

952
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:27,653
Isn't she so pretty?

953
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:28,821
- The prettiest.

954
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:30,114
- You are the princess.

955
01:13:30,114 --> 01:13:33,325
- Ah, I get to be the princess.

956
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:35,160
Wow, aren't you sweet.

957
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:40,958
- Go see mommy.

958
01:13:40,958 --> 01:13:42,459
And be nice to each other

959
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:43,919
or she'll go back into a coma.

960
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,004
- No she won't, stop lying!

961
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,385
- Hey babies.

962
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:52,970
- Hi, mommy.
- Hi.

963
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,346
- Hi, how are you?

964
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,889
- I'm breaking a sweat

965
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:57,558
but I'm happy to be awake.

966
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,353
Hey, you guys wanna see something?

967
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:03,689
Okay.

968
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,151
-  Mom!

969
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:09,278
- What?

970
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:10,279
- Your booty.

971
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,698
-  You saw my little booty?

972
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,742
- All right now girls,

973
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,035
let's remember we have to have fun

974
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:18,787
a little bit at a time, okay

975
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,873
so we don't tire your mom out too much.

976
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,628
- Ew, mommy!

977
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,843
- Wow, I don't think I've
ever made a noise that loud.

978
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,345
- Do you girls wanna help me
take the bag out to the car?

979
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:36,180
You wanna help your mom

980
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:37,014
do that?
- Yeah.

981
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:38,682
- Yeah, sure.

982
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:40,350
-  Thank you.

983
01:14:46,231 --> 01:14:47,149
- Hi.

984
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,775
I'm here to see Robin Miller?

985
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:50,694
- Oh, she'll be out in just a minute.

986
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:51,778
You can wait for her over there.

987
01:14:51,778 --> 01:14:53,030
- Okay, thanks.

988
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,041
Oh my god.

989
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:05,459
Oh my god.

990
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,836
I love you, I'm so happy you're awake.

991
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:09,630
- I'm happy I'm okay too.

992
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:10,714
Happy I was so missed.

993
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,551
Hey, hey, hey, none of that.

994
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:16,678
- I know, I'm just, I'm so...

995
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,058
- Are you okay?

996
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,354
- Yeah, I'm just so happy you're back.

997
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:29,066
- Hey.

998
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:32,569
Car's ready.

999
01:15:32,569 --> 01:15:34,029
Let's get you home.

1000
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,072
-  Where's Jada?

1001
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:35,948
- Ah, couldn't make it.

1002
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,199
Some kind of work thing.

1003
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,825
She said she'd call later.

1004
01:15:38,825 --> 01:15:40,202
-  Some sort of
work thing, seriously?

1005
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,037
-  Yeah, she'll come over soon.

1006
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,635
You okay?

1007
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:58,428
- Yeah.

1008
01:16:02,307 --> 01:16:05,769
Oh my god, can we stop and get soft serve?

1009
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,063
Chocolate soft serve, I need it.

1010
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,022
- You got it, baby.

1011
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:14,945
- Okay.

1012
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:25,122
- Shh.

1013
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,590
- Are we ordering pizza?

1014
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:36,425
- Pizza, pizza, pizza!

1015
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:40,762
- Why don't we ask your
mom what she wants to eat

1016
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:44,182
since she's been eating
through a tube for months?

1017
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:46,852
- You monster.
- Pizza, pizza,

1018
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:48,645
pizza, pizza!

1019
01:16:48,645 --> 01:16:49,688
- Pizza?

1020
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,982
Ooh, I don't know.

1021
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:54,651
I'm sure that there's
something in the fridge

1022
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:56,445
that we could heat up!

1023
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,279
- No!

1024
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:05,370
- Jesus Christ there are a
lot of leftovers in here.

1025
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:13,337
Okay.

1026
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,548
Oh, no.

1027
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,050
Oh, not ready for that yet.

1028
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:22,804
People been bringing you leftovers, baby?

1029
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,181
- It was mostly Aunt Greece.

1030
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:25,265
-  Oh was it?

1031
01:17:25,265 --> 01:17:28,060
- Yeah, she was unstoppable.

1032
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,519
We can throw it all out.

1033
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:46,161
- Hi, I'd like to order
a medium cheese pizza

1034
01:17:46,161 --> 01:17:48,163
and a large Hawaiian.

1035
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:26,076
Is it grossing you out?

1036
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:27,994
- Not at all.

1037
01:18:42,342 --> 01:18:44,720
You know, when I saw him

1038
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:48,306
he looked like a little boy.

1039
01:18:51,601 --> 01:18:53,103
I was expecting a man.

1040
01:18:55,355 --> 01:18:57,482
I remembered a man, in fact.

1041
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:03,238
But then I saw him looking so scared

1042
01:19:05,073 --> 01:19:06,616
saying bye to his mom.

1043
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:11,246
Just a goddamn kid.

1044
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:14,374
- I never really got to
look at him, I guess.

1045
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,343
- Careful.
- Okay.

1046
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,773
- I don't feel anything but overwhelmed.

1047
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:43,361
When I think too much it
just makes me wanna puke.

1048
01:20:05,258 --> 01:20:06,593
- Hi.
- Hi.

1049
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,345
- Look at you.
- Come in, come in.

1050
01:20:09,262 --> 01:20:10,722
Oh, careful there.

1051
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,810
You got to remember I'm
a delicate flower now.

1052
01:20:14,810 --> 01:20:15,644
- Oh, of course.

1053
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,480
That was stupid, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1054
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,481
- It's okay.

1055
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:26,738
Okay, cut it out.

1056
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:30,450
Just get in there and
make me some breakfast.

1057
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:38,625
- How about an omelet?

1058
01:20:38,625 --> 01:20:39,543
-  Perfect.

1059
01:20:53,849 --> 01:20:55,267
- Oh, sweetheart.

1060
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:11,366
Shit!

1061
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,410
- Sorry.

1062
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:14,661
Sorry, I'm sorry.

1063
01:21:15,495 --> 01:21:16,538
I'm so sorry.

1064
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:19,833
Sorry.

1065
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:20,667
- I got it.

1066
01:21:22,752 --> 01:21:23,920
- I'm so sorry, what a mess.

1067
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:24,754
- Hey, no big deal.

1068
01:21:24,754 --> 01:21:26,965
- Why don't I go buy breakfast?
I'm too much of a klutz

1069
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,300
to cook anyway.
- Whatever.

1070
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,927
I saw the mountains of
leftovers in my fridge.

1071
01:21:30,927 --> 01:21:32,929
I know you know your
way around my kitchen.

1072
01:21:32,929 --> 01:21:34,014
- Breakfast sandwiches?

1073
01:21:34,014 --> 01:21:35,765
-  Hey, hey, hey relax.

1074
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,309
- I'll see you in a little bit.

1075
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:44,816
-  What's with her?

1076
01:21:46,067 --> 01:21:46,985
- Not a clue.

1077
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:49,863
- And what's with you?

1078
01:21:50,905 --> 01:21:51,740
- Me?

1079
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:53,491
Nothing.

1080
01:21:54,701 --> 01:21:56,453
I'm a happy man.

1081
01:21:56,453 --> 01:21:58,788
- Maybe if you'd seemed
less upset about the glass

1082
01:21:58,788 --> 01:22:00,290
she wouldn't have felt so bad.

1083
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:03,209
- I don't think Greece would get worked up

1084
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,377
over broken glass.

1085
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:06,880
- Oh?

1086
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,424
Then what is it that my
sister gets worked up over?

1087
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:20,602
Come here.

1088
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:21,853
Give me a kiss.

1089
01:23:01,976 --> 01:23:02,811
-  Hey babe.

1090
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:03,645
- Hey.

1091
01:23:04,604 --> 01:23:06,815
Oh god, I'm so glad that you picked up.

1092
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,609
Why aren't you here, what are you doing?

1093
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,819
-  I'm an asshole.

1094
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:13,488
I just had a lot of work things.

1095
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:17,117
I'm so swamped.

1096
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:17,951
- Swamped?

1097
01:23:18,868 --> 01:23:20,578
Are you fucking kidding me?

1098
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:23,081
Get your ass over here, I wanna see you.

1099
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:25,542
-  First thing tomorrow, I promise.

1100
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:26,376
- Jada!

1101
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:30,547
-  It's so good to hear your voice.

1102
01:23:30,547 --> 01:23:32,132
It sounds different, you know.

1103
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,303
Kind of like you haven't been
using it a while or something.

1104
01:23:37,303 --> 01:23:38,179
- Are you okay?

1105
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,057
Are you crying?

1106
01:23:41,057 --> 01:23:42,684
-  Yeah, it's cool.

1107
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:44,978
I'm a mess.

1108
01:23:44,978 --> 01:23:46,020
- Can you please come over?

1109
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,898
-  Tomorrow, I promise.

1110
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:32,233
-  Mom?

1111
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:33,526
- Two minutes, hon bun.

1112
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:47,999
Oh come here.

1113
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,172
Were you two tidying the bookshelf?

1114
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:55,048
- No.

1115
01:24:55,048 --> 01:24:55,882
- No.

1116
01:24:58,843 --> 01:25:00,178
- Was it you?

1117
01:25:00,178 --> 01:25:01,012
- No.

1118
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,140
It might have been Jada.

1119
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,892
I don't remember.

1120
01:25:07,143 --> 01:25:08,603
I don't remember.

1121
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:10,021
- Seems like it was easier to get her here

1122
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:12,565
when I was in a coma than
it is now that I'm awake.

1123
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,834
- Can I help you, ma'am?

1124
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:34,170
- Why yes sir, I seem to
have misplaced my sock.

1125
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:38,299
Mm, yes, that's the one.

1126
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,511
No!

1127
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,428
No, no, no.

1128
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,473
No, I'm gonna pee.

1129
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,392
Oh, I'm gonna pee, stop!

1130
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,560
Okay, oh.

1131
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:49,727
I'm gonna pee.

1132
01:26:34,105 --> 01:26:35,440
-  Baby.

1133
01:26:37,150 --> 01:26:37,984
- Come in.

1134
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:47,452
I had an accident.

1135
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,041
- Guess you did.

1136
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,225
Girls are ready.

1137
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,353
- Okay.

1138
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:15,396
- God, it's good to have you back.

1139
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,023
- Is it?

1140
01:27:17,023 --> 01:27:18,316
Say it again.

1141
01:27:18,316 --> 01:27:20,151
- Best thing that's ever happened to me.

1142
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:27,116
- It's such a strange feeling knowing

1143
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:29,535
that things have happened
past my last memory.

1144
01:27:30,411 --> 01:27:35,416
I mean, everything feels alien and

1145
01:27:37,168 --> 01:27:39,462
the furniture has had
more experience than me.

1146
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:44,050
I feel just,

1147
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:50,056
far away, I guess?

1148
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,810
- I'm sorry that you're having

1149
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:56,104
an emotional experience
with the furniture.

1150
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,147
- It's strange, okay?

1151
01:27:58,147 --> 01:27:59,691
I don't know how to explain it.

1152
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:02,652
I don't know who's been in my house

1153
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:06,656
or sat in my chairs or
eaten off my spoons.

1154
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,659
I don't even know who's
been holding our kids.

1155
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:10,827
And I don't wanna hear about it,

1156
01:28:10,827 --> 01:28:13,079
I just wanna know.

1157
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:16,791
- None of it matters.

1158
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:19,627
It was all awful.

1159
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:23,715
Life without you is no life.

1160
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,224
-  Okay.

1161
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:35,059
My neato burrito.

1162
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:35,935
- Oh, scoot over.

1163
01:28:42,984 --> 01:28:45,361
This is the happiest I've
ever been in my entire life.

1164
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:47,488
I'm never letting anyone leave this room.

1165
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:53,036
- Well I think we should all go to bed now

1166
01:28:53,036 --> 01:28:57,040
and regroup in our happy place tomorrow.

1167
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,041
Deal?

1168
01:28:58,041 --> 01:28:59,667
- No deal.

1169
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,793
I don't wanna wait

1170
01:29:00,793 --> 01:29:02,462
because so what if you get shot?

1171
01:29:03,337 --> 01:29:04,422
- Hey.

1172
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:06,424
No one's gonna shoot me.

1173
01:29:06,424 --> 01:29:08,384
And you should know that I am not scared

1174
01:29:08,384 --> 01:29:09,510
of bad guys, okay?

1175
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:11,095
Not even a little bit.

1176
01:29:11,095 --> 01:29:12,472
And you shouldn't be either.

1177
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:15,475
Okay?
- Okay.

1178
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:16,309
- Okay.

1179
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:17,477
Good night.

1180
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:19,187
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.

1181
01:29:34,494 --> 01:29:36,204
- Maybe we should slow down a bit

1182
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:40,500
and give you a little time
to settle in with family.

1183
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:45,671
- Something doesn't feel right.

1184
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,511
-  That's understandable.

1185
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,181
- I don't think it is.

1186
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:06,317
- What do you think it is?

1187
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:08,319
- It'll be hard for me to
know that, wouldn't it?

1188
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:47,442
- Hi, mommy.

1189
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:48,359
- Hey baby.

1190
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:53,114
Here for a late night visit.

1191
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:58,286
Did you miss mommy?

1192
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:02,707
- Yeah.
- Yes, good.

1193
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:07,462
Hey baby?

1194
01:31:11,257 --> 01:31:13,759
Were Aunt Greece and Jada here a lot

1195
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:15,636
when I was sleeping?

1196
01:31:16,679 --> 01:31:17,471
- Yes.
- Okay.

1197
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:21,976
Who was here more?

1198
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:24,645
-  I don't know.

1199
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:28,733
But Aunt Greece was with me and Daddy

1200
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:31,527
and Jada was with Matilda and Daddy.

1201
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:37,283
- Did they spend a lot of time with Daddy?

1202
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:40,870
-  I don't know.

1203
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,083
- And did they ever sleep here?

1204
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:49,837
-  Yes, a little bit on the couch

1205
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:52,048
and a little bit with us.

1206
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:53,132
- Okay, okay.

1207
01:31:55,801 --> 01:31:57,220
And what about Daddy?

1208
01:31:58,221 --> 01:31:59,388
-  He slept too.

1209
01:32:00,306 --> 01:32:01,891
- Okay, baby, okay.

1210
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:07,146
Go back to sleep, okay?

1211
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:09,500
- Hey.

1212
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:11,669
Babe.

1213
01:33:13,045 --> 01:33:14,588
What's wrong?

1214
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:15,423
You okay?

1215
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,349
Hey, talk to me.

1216
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:28,477
Baby, talk to me.

1217
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,788
I love you so much, baby, please.

1218
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:51,167
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1219
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:57,506
Baby, I love you so much.

1220
01:33:58,549 --> 01:34:03,554
-  Oh God.

1221
01:34:13,981 --> 01:34:18,903
Our family.

1222
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:21,864
- We still are.

1223
01:34:21,864 --> 01:34:23,199
We are a family.

1224
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:27,828
It's you, me, our girls.

1225
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,708
I was a dead man.

1226
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:37,129
- Fuck.

1227
01:34:42,301 --> 01:34:43,177
I wanna leave.

1228
01:34:47,264 --> 01:34:48,516
- Yeah, we can leave.

1229
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:51,936
We'll pack up and leave and come back home

1230
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,020
when you're ready.

1231
01:34:53,020 --> 01:34:54,271
- Okay, can we go now?

1232
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:55,106
-  Now?

1233
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:00,903
It's five in the morning.

1234
01:35:01,862 --> 01:35:02,947
The girls are asleep.

1235
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:05,491
You need to get more rest.

1236
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:08,953
- I don't wanna stay
here and be like this.

1237
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,915
I wanna leave with my family.

1238
01:35:19,213 --> 01:35:20,673
-  Okay, we'll leave now.

1239
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:17,480
- Great.

1240
01:36:22,818 --> 01:36:23,652
Oh, shit.

1241
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,323
-  There's no one here.

1242
01:36:28,240 --> 01:36:29,325
- What?

1243
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:32,703
- No car, no one's in the house.

1244
01:36:32,703 --> 01:36:33,954
-  Where'd they go?

1245
01:36:34,997 --> 01:36:36,540
Ugh.

1246
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:37,750
-  What are you doing?

1247
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:39,376
-  Did you try calling them?

1248
01:36:39,376 --> 01:36:40,336
-  No one picked up.

1249
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:41,170
-  Right.

1250
01:38:57,806 --> 01:39:00,309
- May you go with the lord.
