00:00:48,302 --> 00:00:52,672
¶ MEET ME IN A DOORWAY ¶

2
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,909
¶ I'LL BE PAINTING PICTURES
OF GATES ¶

3
00:00:56,977 --> 00:01:01,381
¶ YOU WERE SO CRAZY
I WAS SO CHASTE ¶

4
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:03,650
¶ I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO ME ¶

5
00:01:03,717 --> 00:01:05,752
¶ I DON'T KNOW ¶

6
00:01:05,819 --> 00:01:11,591
¶ I-I-I, I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT ¶

7
00:01:14,928 --> 00:01:20,333
¶ I-I-I, I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT ¶

8
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,306
¶ YOU RENDERED ME CONSCIOUS ¶

9
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:31,877
¶ YOU CUT MY INNOCENT FACE ¶

10
00:01:31,945 --> 00:01:36,015
¶ I'M NOT REALLY BITTER
THINKIN' I'M NOT AMUSED ¶

11
00:01:36,082 --> 00:01:40,620
¶ I JUST WANT TO KICK YOU
'TIL YOU CRY
I LOVED, I REALLY LOVED YOU ¶

12
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:46,192
¶ I-I-I, I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT ¶

13
00:01:52,265 --> 00:01:56,135
BY SENIOR YEAR, I HAD
IT COVERED, OR SO I THOUGHT.

14
00:01:56,203 --> 00:02:00,973
I HAD A GREAT GUY,
SIGHTS ON COLLEGE, ART SCHOOL,

15
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:04,777
AND THE DREAM OF LIFE BEYOND.

16
00:02:04,845 --> 00:02:07,079
GOOD MORNING, ARTHUR.
IT'S A DECOY, ARTHUR.

17
00:02:07,147 --> 00:02:10,216
THE AK-47'S IN HER BACKPACK.
YEAH, RIGHT.

18
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:21,527
YOU TELL YOURSELF TO COUNT THE
DAYS AND PUT UP WITH THE SHIT.

19
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:25,665
YOU TELL YOURSELF
THESE PEOPLE ARE ILLUSIONS,
PASSING SCENERY.

20
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:34,574
HEY, SNAP THESE, BABE!

21
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:41,748
THEY WERE NOTHING TO ME.
I JUST USE THEM FOR MY ART.

22
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:46,051
NO BLADING IN THE HALL.
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE
TO TELL YOU AGAIN!

23
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:51,223
OKAY, YOU JOCKSTRAP SNIFFERS,
SAY "CHEESE."
ACTION.

24
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:58,431
¶ I'LL BE WEARING
MIDDLETON'S LACE ¶

25
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:01,133
¶ IT'S AS STERILE
AS CHESS ¶

26
00:03:01,201 --> 00:03:03,603
¶ NOBODY'D GUESS ¶

27
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,274
¶ YOU WERE TOUCHING ME
BETWEEN THE LOVE OF GOD
AND SISTER MERCY ¶

28
00:03:08,341 --> 00:03:13,746
¶ I-I-I, I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT ¶

29
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:16,883
LOOK OUT! COMIN' THROUGH.

30
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,722
¶ I-I-I, I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT IT ¶

31
00:03:25,392 --> 00:03:28,193
¶ THINK ABOUT IT ¶

32
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,734
MOST OF ALL,
I AVOIDED THE SNARES,
SKATING PAST THE OBSTACLES...

33
00:03:34,802 --> 00:03:38,370
THE WAY EVERYBODY
WHO CAN MANAGE IT DOES.

34
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,409
¶ DING WENT
THE LITTLE GREEN FROG ¶

35
00:03:43,477 --> 00:03:48,881
¶ GUH-DING WENT THE LITTLE
GREEN FROG ONE DAY ¶

36
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:52,685
¶ AND HIS EYES
WENT AGGH-AGGH-GUNG ¶

37
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:58,157
OKAY, HOLD THESE SUCKERS
DOWN ON THEIR BACKS.

38
00:03:58,224 --> 00:04:00,259
READY FOR SURGERY.

39
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:02,728
NAIL 'EM GOOD.

40
00:04:02,796 --> 00:04:05,898
LAST YEAR WE HAD ONE
OF THESE RIPPITS JUMP OFF...

41
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,801
DURING THE INCISION
OF A PULMONARY VEIN.

42
00:04:08,869 --> 00:04:13,506
IT WEREN'T PRETTY.
OH, GOD.

43
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:16,041
WHAT IS IT, RITA?
I CAN'T DO IT.

44
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,078
- FLAKE.
- GET OFF HER SHIT ALREADY.

45
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:52,177
HELLO, RITA!

46
00:04:53,714 --> 00:04:57,817
TAKE THE SCALPEL.

47
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:00,386
EARTH TO RITA.

48
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,622
IT'S SO DEFENSELESS.

49
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:25,778
FROGS, THEY DON'T HAVE FEELINGS
LIKE WE DO, RITA.

50
00:05:25,846 --> 00:05:29,214
BUT THEIR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
IS AN EXCELLENT MODEL FOR OURS.

51
00:05:29,282 --> 00:05:33,318
IN OTHER WORDS, THEIR LITTLE
HEARTS WORK A LOT LIKE OURS DO.

52
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:41,160
YOUNG MAN. YOUNG MAN,
STOP WHEN I'M TALKIN' TO YOU!

53
00:05:44,765 --> 00:05:47,166
WHAT CLASS
SHOULD YOU BE IN?

54
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:51,704
BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED,
UNEXPECTED.

55
00:05:53,607 --> 00:05:55,741
I FELT IT BEFORE I KNEW IT.

56
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:08,153
EXCUSE ME.

57
00:06:08,221 --> 00:06:10,022
IF YOU'RE NEW,
PLEASE TAKE A SEAT.

58
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,959
<i>I'LL GET
THE PAPERWORK LATER.</i>

59
00:06:13,026 --> 00:06:16,696
IF I'D KNOWN YOU WERE COMING,
I'D HAVE ORDERED YOU A FROG.

60
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:24,303
<i>ALL RIGHT, WHERE WERE WE?
CLASS, LET'S CONCENTRATE
ON THE FROG.</i>

61
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,873
ON THE FROG!

62
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:31,110
ALL RIGHT, LET'S START SLICING
AND THIS AIN'T PIZZA.
WATCH THOSE VEGETABLES.

63
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,915
LET'S ALL SHOW RITA
WE CAN DO THIS.

64
00:06:35,983 --> 00:06:39,318
OKAY?
RITA, ARE YOU WITH US?

65
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:45,357
ALL RIGHT.

66
00:06:45,425 --> 00:06:49,495
TAKE THE SCALPEL NOW.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS
FOR THREE WEEKS.

67
00:06:49,562 --> 00:06:53,933
WE'RE HOLDING THINGS UP.
LET'S NOT WASTE ANY MORE TIME.

68
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:57,903
I'M GONNA COUNT TO THREE AND
YOU'LL TAKE THE SCALPEL, OKAY?

69
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:01,040
ONE.

70
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:03,643
TWO.

71
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:07,713
THREE.
HEY, LET'S DO IT!

72
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:11,651
<i>- NO, I CAN'T DO IT.
- COME ON, LET'S GO.</i>

73
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:14,353
- I CAN'T!
- OKAY, FINE, WE'RE GONNA TALK
IN DETENTION THEN, OKAY?

74
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,289
NO!
CLASS, ANYONE ELSE
HAVING A PROBLEM?

75
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:19,358
WHAT'S THE DEAL
WITH DETENTION?

76
00:07:19,425 --> 00:07:21,593
HE'S ALWAYS GIVING HER SHIT.
HE'S SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

77
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:23,729
SO MAKE HIM STOP.

78
00:07:25,932 --> 00:07:28,067
<i>OKAY, I'LL DO IT.
WHAT?</i>

79
00:07:28,135 --> 00:07:32,437
<i>I'M GONNA DO IT, OKAY?
I'M GONNA DO IT,
ALL RIGHT?</i>

80
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:35,141
ALL RIGHT, CLASS,
YOU HEAR THAT?
RITA'S GONNA DO IT.

81
00:07:39,913 --> 00:07:43,716
ATTA, GIRL.
WAY TO GO.

82
00:07:43,784 --> 00:07:46,285
SHE'S NOW AIMING IT
AT THE POINT OF INCISION.

83
00:07:52,993 --> 00:07:56,495
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING,
YOUNG LADY?

84
00:07:58,965 --> 00:08:02,034
<i>HEY, I'M TALKIN' TO YOU!</i>

85
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:05,805
<i>- I'LL SEE YOU
IN DETENTION ALSO.
- I DON'T EVEN GO HERE.</i>

86
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:17,750
IT WASN'T OVER.

87
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:20,019
I COULD FEEL IT...

88
00:08:20,087 --> 00:08:24,223
LIKE A CHARGE IN THE AIR
BEFORE A STORM.

89
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,826
WHAT ELSE DOES HE DO?

90
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:31,263
HE, UM,

91
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:33,966
HE GETS REALLY CLOSE...

92
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:37,169
AND HE TOUCHES MY CHEST.

93
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,846
WHAT'S GOING ON?
RITA'S MAKING UP SHIT
ABOUT MR. BUTTINGER.

94
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:50,750
I'M NOT!
OKAY? I'M NOT!

95
00:08:54,788 --> 00:08:57,389
HE GETS BEHIND ME...

96
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:01,127
AND HE RUBS HIMSELF
ON MY ASS.

97
00:09:01,194 --> 00:09:04,263
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD
SOMEONE DOES.
SHUT UP, CINDY.

98
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:08,033
SHE'S CRAZY.
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.
SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

99
00:09:12,072 --> 00:09:14,106
HE DOES IT TO ME TOO.

100
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:17,810
YOU DON'T COUNT, VIOLET.
YOU DO IT WITH EVERYONE.

101
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:19,745
WELL, AT LEAST I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

102
00:09:19,813 --> 00:09:23,249
IF HALF THE STORIES ABOUT YOU
ARE TRUE--
GIVE IT A REST, CINDY.

103
00:09:23,316 --> 00:09:27,920
LOOK. YOU'RE THE ASSHOLES
FOR LETTING HIM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

104
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:31,556
NO. YOU'RE THE ASSHOLE FOR
LETTING HIM GET AWAY WITH IT!

105
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:34,726
EXCUSE ME.
WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?

106
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:39,398
GET OUT OF MY WAY.

107
00:09:39,465 --> 00:09:41,733
YOU'RE ALL ASSHOLES.

108
00:09:41,802 --> 00:09:46,205
BECAUSE WHEN THAT SON OF A BITCH
PUTS HIS HANDS ON HER,

109
00:09:46,273 --> 00:09:49,275
YOU SHOULD TELL YOURSELVES
HE'S PUTTING HIS HANDS
ALL OVER YOU.

110
00:09:50,944 --> 00:09:52,711
OR YOU, OR YOU, OR YOU!

111
00:09:54,915 --> 00:09:56,849
BECAUSE HE SURE AS HELL WOULD
IF HE COULD.

112
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:59,118
SO, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

113
00:09:59,186 --> 00:10:02,188
- MAKE SURE HE NEVER
DOES IT AGAIN.
- HOW?

114
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:07,059
WE STICK TOGETHER.
GIMME A BREAK.

115
00:10:14,935 --> 00:10:18,838
SO, ARE WE TOGETHER?

116
00:10:31,985 --> 00:10:34,019
GOOD.

117
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:38,690
GOOD.

118
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:58,710
WE'RE JUST GONNA SIT HERE, RITA,
UNTIL WE LEARN SOMETHING
ABOUT THE HEART.

119
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:10,022
YOU KNOW, RITA,

120
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,859
YOU HAVE VERY LITTLE
CONFIDENCE...

121
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:18,697
FOR SOMEONE WITH
SO MUCH POTENTIAL, TALENT.

122
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,509
WHAT IS THAT?

123
00:11:30,576 --> 00:11:33,512
WHAT IS THAT OVER THERE?

124
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,218
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY.

125
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:41,720
PRETTY AND TALENTED
AREN'T THE SAME.

126
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:44,456
WHAT? SAYS WHO?

127
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:49,761
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.

128
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:57,937
YOU KNOW,
YOU JUST DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR VALUE AS A WOMAN.

129
00:12:02,075 --> 00:12:07,112
YOU KNOW, I, I THINK
YOU'RE WAY AHEAD OF ALL
THE GIRLS YOUR AGE. HUH?

130
00:12:11,952 --> 00:12:14,719
VIOLET.
MR. BUTTINGER,

131
00:12:14,787 --> 00:12:17,689
I FORGOT MY NOTEBOOK.

132
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:20,159
WELL, GET IT.

133
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:27,099
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MADELINE?

134
00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,538
- WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
- DON'T LET US STOP YOU.
GO ON WITH WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

135
00:12:33,606 --> 00:12:35,640
- PERVERT!
- COME HERE, RED.

136
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:39,744
- THAT YOUNG LADY
IS IN DETENTION TODAY.
- WE NEED TO TALK.

137
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:42,047
- KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF RITA.
- AND VIOLET.

138
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:45,650
AND WHOEVER THE FUCK ELSE
YOU DO THIS TO.

139
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:49,955
<i>- HOW DOES THAT FEEL?
- FUCKING LITTLE PUNK!</i>

140
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:52,757
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU BETTER MOVE.
YOU BETTER KEEP MOVING.

141
00:12:52,825 --> 00:12:55,594
OR WHAT?

142
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,263
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS!
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY
OUTRAGEOUS!

143
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:02,067
<i>I'M A TEACHER!
MADELINE.</i>

144
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:06,738
MADELINE, COME ON!
YOU DON'T BELIEVE RITA.
SHE'S EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE.

145
00:13:06,806 --> 00:13:09,208
- I'M NOT UNSTABLE!
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT.

146
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,776
I'M NOT UNSTABLE!

147
00:13:11,844 --> 00:13:13,778
LEAVE HER ALONE!

148
00:13:16,782 --> 00:13:19,184
NO! STOP!

149
00:13:27,394 --> 00:13:30,295
IF YOU EVER PUT YOUR HANDS
ON ME AGAIN,

150
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:32,864
I'LL SNIP YOUR LITTLE NUTS OFF
WITH MY TOENAIL CLIPPERS.

151
00:13:32,932 --> 00:13:34,666
ALL RIGHT?

152
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:38,637
THIS IS GREAT!
BUTTINGER'S SUCH A FUCK!

153
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:41,273
RITA. RITA.

154
00:13:43,043 --> 00:13:46,111
<i>ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO.
GET OUT OF HERE. GO!</i>

155
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,515
COME ON.

156
00:13:57,057 --> 00:13:58,990
CAN YOU GET UP?

157
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:05,931
NEXT TIME YOU
THINK ABOUT FUCKING
WITH SOME YOUNG GIRL,

158
00:14:05,998 --> 00:14:08,667
YOU THINK ABOUT THIS FIRST.

159
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:26,918
FUCK!

160
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:30,222
FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

161
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,024
WHAT IF SOMEONE SAW US?
OH, MY GOD,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

162
00:14:33,093 --> 00:14:36,495
WE SHOULD GET THE HELL
OUTTA HERE.
OH, MY GOD, WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

163
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:39,965
JUST STAY CALM.
WE ARE IN SO MUCH--

164
00:14:40,032 --> 00:14:42,767
WHO WAS SHE ANYWAY?

165
00:14:54,247 --> 00:14:56,915
I THINK WE SHOULD ALL
GO SOMEWHERE TOGETHER.

166
00:14:56,983 --> 00:15:00,085
DOES THIS BITCH ALWAYS TALK
IN EXCLAMATION MARKS?

167
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:06,658
WE SHOULD ALL JUST GO HOME.
THIS IS GONNA BE
WHAT IT'S GONNA BE.

168
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:13,698
"IF YOU EVER PUT YOUR HANDS
ON ME AGAIN,

169
00:15:13,766 --> 00:15:17,569
I'M GONNA SNIP
YOUR LITTLE NUTS OFF
WITH MY TOENAIL CLIPPERS."

170
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:19,804
I SAID THAT?

171
00:15:22,308 --> 00:15:25,076
THE DORK!

172
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:26,805
SHIT.

173
00:16:32,745 --> 00:16:37,416
MADDY, SWEETHEART,
DID I SCARE YOU?
AH, NO, NO. GET IN HERE.

174
00:16:41,721 --> 00:16:44,323
HI.
HI.

175
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,227
OKAY, UH... COME IN.
THANK YOU.

176
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:59,137
SPICA IN VIRGO.

177
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:04,509
A JUNE SKY.

178
00:17:06,812 --> 00:17:09,013
HOW DID YOU GET HERE?

179
00:17:09,081 --> 00:17:11,350
I CLIMBED.

180
00:17:11,417 --> 00:17:14,519
NO. I MEAN, HOW
DID YOU FIND MY HOUSE?

181
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:19,691
YOU DROPPED THIS.
SORRY, IT'S WET.

182
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,160
IT'S OKAY.

183
00:17:22,228 --> 00:17:26,798
UM, DO YOU HAVE A DRY SHIRT
OR SOMETHING?
I'M REALLY KIND OF WET.

184
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:29,434
YEAH, YEAH, SURE.
THANK YOU.

185
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:36,708
SO, WHERE DO YOU LIVE,
ANYWAY?

186
00:17:36,776 --> 00:17:42,681
MOSTLY IN MY HEAD.
I'M JUST PASSIN' THROUGH.

187
00:17:42,749 --> 00:17:47,051
<i>THAT'S NOT VERY SAFE,
YOU KNOW.
I LOOK IN THEIR EYES.</i>

188
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,054
IF I DON'T THINK IT'S SAFE,
I DON'T GET IN THE CAR.

189
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:54,526
HOW CAN YOU TELL?
IT'S A QUESTION
OF REALLY LOOKING.

190
00:17:58,564 --> 00:18:01,700
MAD, PICK IT UP.
LOOK, I HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.

191
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:04,670
IS THAT YOUR BOYFRIEND?

192
00:18:04,737 --> 00:18:07,839
WHERE ARE YOU?
JUST CALL ME.

193
00:18:07,907 --> 00:18:10,609
I LOVE YOU.

194
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:15,647
HERE, UM, PUT THIS ON.

195
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:17,716
THANK YOU.

196
00:18:22,822 --> 00:18:27,025
SO, WHERE
DO YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

197
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,394
DON'T.
I WAS THROWN OUT.

198
00:18:29,462 --> 00:18:34,399
<i>FOR WHAT?
FOR THINKING
FOR MYSELF.</i>

199
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:37,902
SO, TELL ME ABOUT BUTTINGER.
IS THAT HIS NAME?

200
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,772
GOD, I HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

201
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:45,477
I MEAN, RITA VALDEZ
ISN'T EVEN MY FRIEND.
NONE OF THOSE GIRLS ARE.

202
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:49,247
THAT'S... WHAT'S SO WEIRD.

203
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,983
WELL, SHE IS NOW,
FOR LIFE.

204
00:18:57,357 --> 00:19:00,659
DO YOU MIND?
NO, NO, GO AHEAD.

205
00:19:00,727 --> 00:19:04,863
- THERE'S SOME BEEF JERKY.
I CAN GET YOU SOMETHING?
- IT'S OKAY.

206
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:12,103
DO YOU MIND IF I SLEEP
ON YOUR FLOOR TONIGHT?

207
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,407
AH, YEAH.

208
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:19,411
ARE YOU SURE?

209
00:19:19,479 --> 00:19:21,613
MM-HMM.

210
00:19:21,681 --> 00:19:23,582
GOOD.

211
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,558
GOOD MORNING, HON.
YEAH.
ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

212
00:19:33,626 --> 00:19:36,127
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT.
YEAH.

213
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:40,331
DID ETHAN STAY OVER,
MADDY?

214
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,502
NO, NO!

215
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,070
IT'S ONLY A GIRL.

216
00:19:47,874 --> 00:19:51,676
WHO IS SHE?
SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE
IN STAIRS?

217
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:56,180
- WHO IS SHE?
- SHE'S MY DRUG DEALER.

218
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:45,997
I THOUGHT I LOST YA.

219
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:55,239
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.
SHE SAYS THE NEXT MORNING.

220
00:20:56,742 --> 00:21:00,144
DON'T WORRY.
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.

221
00:21:00,212 --> 00:21:02,413
OH?

222
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:04,415
WHAT'S THIS?

223
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:07,519
THAT'S MY ART STUFF.

224
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:11,022
IT'S A CAMERA. YEAH.

225
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:13,692
HMM. RIGHT.

226
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,795
LEGS.

227
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:19,130
WH-- WHAT ABOUT 'EM?

228
00:21:19,198 --> 00:21:22,266
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE CALL ME.

229
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:26,304
I VAULT WITHOUT POLES.

230
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,941
<i>THAT SORT OF THING.</i>

231
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,813
UM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

232
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:39,751
COME ON, YOU'RE GONNA FALL.

233
00:21:41,521 --> 00:21:45,456
I'M NOT WATCHING THIS.
I'M NOT.
COME AND GET IT.

234
00:21:45,525 --> 00:21:48,827
<i>I'M AFRAID
OF HEIGHTS.
OH, HOW AFRAID?</i>

235
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:52,163
ARE YOU THIS AFRAID?

236
00:21:52,231 --> 00:21:53,698
DOES THIS SCARE YOU?

237
00:21:53,766 --> 00:21:55,433
COME ON, LEGS.

238
00:21:55,501 --> 00:21:58,069
IF IT WAS
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU,
YOU'D COME GET IT.

239
00:21:58,137 --> 00:22:01,072
- I WANNA PUKE! COME ON!
- COME ON UP HERE.
DANCE WITH ME.

240
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,608
<i>NO WAY!
COME ON.</i>

241
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,491
OH, BOY.

242
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:33,772
DON'T WORRY, I'LL GET IT.
DON'T WORRY.

243
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,575
LEGS?

244
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,646
DON'T! COME ON.
OH, GOD.

245
00:22:46,118 --> 00:22:48,587
CAREFUL!
LEGS, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

246
00:22:48,654 --> 00:22:52,490
YEAH, IT IS.

247
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:54,358
NO!

248
00:22:54,426 --> 00:22:56,962
<i>YOU DON'T--</i>

249
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:59,864
IT'S OKAY.

250
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:01,532
OH, GOD.

251
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:19,651
GIVE IT TO ME.

252
00:23:19,719 --> 00:23:23,121
ALMOST. OKAY.

253
00:23:25,825 --> 00:23:29,527
EASY.
IT'S OKAY.

254
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,969
YOU'RE A FRIGGIN' LUNATIC,
YOU KNOW THAT? GOD!

255
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:50,882
<i>SO, IS THIS GOOD-BYE?
IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY
BOTTLES I FIND.</i>

256
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,953
FIGURE I NEED $50
BEFORE I MOVE ON.

257
00:23:55,021 --> 00:23:58,056
NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY
BOTTLES TO GO.

258
00:23:58,124 --> 00:24:02,160
I HOPE YOU DON'T FIND
ALL THE BOTTLES YOU NEED TODAY.

259
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:12,103
LOOK, THERE'S A HOUSE ABOUT
A HALF MILE OR SO UP THE RIVER.

260
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:14,438
IT'S ABANDONED.

261
00:24:14,506 --> 00:24:17,408
IF YOU NEEDED A PLACE TO STAY,
I MEAN.

262
00:24:17,476 --> 00:24:19,544
THANK YOU.

263
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:22,681
I GOTTA GO.
I'M LATE.

264
00:24:22,748 --> 00:24:25,449
DON'T TAKE ANY SHIT.

265
00:24:30,056 --> 00:24:33,191
HOW COULD YOU JUST DO THAT
AND NOT TELL ME?

266
00:24:33,258 --> 00:24:38,262
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU,
ETHAN.
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO TO MR. PARKS?

267
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:42,734
IF BUTTINGER DID THAT TO YOU,
PRESSED YOU AGAINST THE
BLACKBOARD, GRABBED YOUR BALLS,

268
00:24:42,802 --> 00:24:45,070
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

269
00:24:45,137 --> 00:24:47,806
HOW?
IT JUST IS, MADDY,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

270
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:54,779
ALL RIGHT, I'D KICK HIS ASS.

271
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:03,454
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
I CALLED.

272
00:25:03,522 --> 00:25:05,690
I PASSED OUT EARLY.

273
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:15,399
COME ON,
LIVE DANGEROUSLY.

274
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,969
WALK ME TO CLASS.

275
00:25:18,037 --> 00:25:20,638
I'LL BE YOUR SUBSTITUTE
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

276
00:25:20,706 --> 00:25:26,410
MR. BUTTINGER IS OUT
DUE TO A MINOR ACCIDENT.

277
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:29,380
AH, ARE YOU MADELINE WIRTZ?

278
00:25:29,448 --> 00:25:32,784
YEAH.
YOU'RE WANTED
IN THE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE.

279
00:25:39,258 --> 00:25:43,361
THIS NOTE WAS INTERCEPTED
BETWEEN TWO STUDENTS IN CLASS.

280
00:25:43,428 --> 00:25:46,097
IS THERE ANY TRUTH
TO IT?

281
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:52,570
IT SAYS WE BEAT UP BUTTINGER.

282
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:02,881
- THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND.
- SO IT'S TRUE?

283
00:26:02,948 --> 00:26:06,550
- HE GRABBED ME.
- SO SHE BUSTED HIS NOSE.
- WHAT?

284
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:10,721
HE WAS SEXUALLY
HARASSING RITA.
AND YOU.

285
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:14,425
THIS IS A
VERY SERIOUS CHARGE.

286
00:26:14,493 --> 00:26:17,829
<i>DUH!
WHAT ARE YOU GIRLS?</i>

287
00:26:17,897 --> 00:26:21,499
SOME SORT OF A GANG HERE?
HMM?

288
00:26:21,566 --> 00:26:26,004
GIRLS WHO RUN WITH FOXES?
THAT SORT OF THING?

289
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,542
SO YOU FIND THIS FUNNY.

290
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,880
OKAY. I AM GOING TO SUSPEND
YOU ALL FOR TWO WEEKS...

291
00:26:35,948 --> 00:26:39,017
<i>FOR YOUR CONDUCT
IN THIS OFFICE AND
FOR ASSAULTING A TEACHER.</i>

292
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:41,085
I WILL HAVE YOU
ESCORTED OUT.

293
00:26:41,153 --> 00:26:43,421
MR. PARKS, I NEED TO STOP BY
THE ART ROOM, PLEASE.

294
00:26:43,488 --> 00:26:46,291
I DON'T THINK SO.
MY APPLICATION
GOES OUT TOMORROW.

295
00:26:46,358 --> 00:26:48,426
YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT
OF THAT BEFORE.
THAT ISN'T FAIR.

296
00:26:48,493 --> 00:26:51,229
- TWO AND A HALF WEEKS.
- WHAT ABOUT MR. BUTTINGER?

297
00:26:51,297 --> 00:26:53,031
YOU LEAVE THAT TO ME.
HE SHOULD BE FIRED.

298
00:26:53,098 --> 00:26:56,634
THREE WEEKS.
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO KEEP GOING?

299
00:26:58,304 --> 00:27:01,306
¶ UH-OH, WE'RE IN TROUBLE ¶

300
00:27:01,373 --> 00:27:05,343
¶ SOMETHING'S COME ALONG
AND IT'S BURST OUR BUBBLE ¶

301
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,546
¶ UH-OH, WE'RE IN TROUBLE ¶

302
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:11,216
¶ GOTTA GET HOME QUICK
MARCH ON THE DOUBLE ¶

303
00:27:11,283 --> 00:27:15,386
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.
YEAH, WHY DON'T
YOU KILL YOURSELF?

304
00:27:15,454 --> 00:27:19,324
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST DROP DEAD?
SAVAGE WIT.

305
00:27:19,391 --> 00:27:23,962
DON'T YOU GET DIZZY
CONSTANTLY LOOKING DOWN ON HER?

306
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:26,998
I CAN'T GO HOME.
MY PARENTS WILL KILL ME.

307
00:27:28,968 --> 00:27:31,369
WE CAN GO TO MY HOUSE
AND WATCH TV.

308
00:27:31,436 --> 00:27:35,073
TV SUCKS, MAN.
IT'S LAME.

309
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:39,110
I KNOW WHERE WE CAN GO.

310
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,568
MR. PARKS,
THIS IS RITA'S MOTHER...

311
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:07,772
AND I'M VERY CONCERNED
ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH RITA.

312
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:12,476
YOU DO A LOVELY MOMMY.
MAYBE YOU WILL CALL HIM FOR ME?

313
00:28:12,544 --> 00:28:15,680
SURE. I'LL DO IT BETTER
ON THE PHONE.

314
00:28:15,747 --> 00:28:18,515
GOOD.
WHERE THE FUCK ARE WE GOING?

315
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:21,719
I'LL CALL YOUR PARENTS TOO
IF YOU WANT.

316
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,988
YEAH, WHATEVER.

317
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,792
ISN'T THIS BEAUTIFUL?

318
00:28:27,859 --> 00:28:32,396
WHOA!
BET IT'S HAUNTED.

319
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:37,134
I BET THE GHOST THAT I SAW
WHEN I WAS LITTLE IS STILL HERE.

320
00:28:37,202 --> 00:28:40,638
YOU SAW A GHOST? REALLY?

321
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:43,440
I SAW A U.F.O.
DID YOU REALLY?

322
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:56,687
<i>OH! WOW!</i>

323
00:28:56,755 --> 00:29:00,524
WHOA! THERE'S A TREE IN HERE!
WE CAN BUILD A TREE HOUSE.

324
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,819
SO, I HEAR
YOU GOT SUSPENDED.

325
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:05,690
YEAH.

326
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:10,995
FOR THINKING FOR MYSELF.

327
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:15,632
THEN CHEERS.

328
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:25,876
GET AWAY FROM ME!

329
00:30:28,379 --> 00:30:30,848
I JUST FOUND IT.

330
00:30:34,419 --> 00:30:37,321
WE ALL GOT SUSPENDED
TOGETHER.

331
00:30:37,388 --> 00:30:39,623
MR. PARKS
IS SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

332
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:43,994
YEAH, HE WOULDN'T LET MADDY
GET HIS AR-- HER ART.

333
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:49,533
- IT'S MY PORTFOLIO.
IT HAS TO GO OUT TOMORROW.
- THEN WE SHOULD GET IT.

334
00:30:49,601 --> 00:30:51,668
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN,
WE SHOULD GET IT!

335
00:30:51,737 --> 00:30:56,173
WE SHOULD GO INTO THE SCHOOL AND
GET IT. IF THERE'S A UTILITY
HATCH ON THE ROOF OR BASEMENT,

336
00:30:56,241 --> 00:31:00,878
WE'LL GO IN AND GET IT.
IF I GOT CAUGHT,
I WOULD BE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE.

337
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:05,182
- SHE TOOK THAT RISK FOR YOU.
- YEAH, I'M DOWN FOR A FELONY.

338
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:10,454
- A FELONY?
- THIS IS WAY RISKY.

339
00:31:10,521 --> 00:31:14,324
WE COULD BE LIKE
DEAD GERBILS UP HERE.

340
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:17,194
THIS IS WHERE
THEY PUT THE BAD KIDS.
I DON'T BELIEVE--

341
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:20,264
I NEED TO GET
OUTTA HERE. IT'S NOT FUNNY.

342
00:31:20,331 --> 00:31:24,534
WHERE'S THE THING?
WE'RE GONNA
GET LOST, WE'RE GONNA DIE.

343
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:27,537
HERE IT IS, HERE IT IS.

344
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:29,606
<i>THANK GOD!</i>

345
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:43,254
THIS IS SO WEIRD.

346
00:31:44,322 --> 00:31:48,859
I CAN'T DO IT.
COME ON.

347
00:31:48,927 --> 00:31:52,830
GOD, PLEASE
DON'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT ME.
WE'RE NOT GOIN' ANYWHERE.

348
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:55,565
WE'RE RIGHT HERE.

349
00:31:55,633 --> 00:32:00,838
OH, FUCK.
IT'S OKAY.
RITA, YOU CAN DO IT.

350
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:04,108
OH, GOOD JOB!
GOOD GIRL.

351
00:32:07,412 --> 00:32:09,746
SHH, SHH.

352
00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:20,925
COME ON!
DON'T YOU LIKE FLASHLIGHTS?

353
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,028
<i>I ALWAYS WANTED ONE
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.</i>

354
00:32:24,095 --> 00:32:26,297
HAND THIS TO VIOLET.
NOT LIKE
A NORMAL FLASHLIGHT.

355
00:32:26,364 --> 00:32:29,033
LIKE THE ONE WHAT WOULD
SUCK UP THE DARKNESS
LIKE A VACUUM CLEANER.

356
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,635
SHUT UP ALREADY.

357
00:32:31,703 --> 00:32:34,071
I GOTTA GET MY STUFF.

358
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:41,245
I ONLY KNEW HOW TO DRAW
ONE THING IN ART CLASS.
A PENIS!

359
00:32:43,414 --> 00:32:46,817
<i>OKAY, HERE.
CALM DOWN.</i>

360
00:32:46,885 --> 00:32:51,121
JUST PUT THE STUFF IN THERE.
ONE MORE. ONE MORE.

361
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:53,790
<i>DID YOU HEAR WHAT
I SAID?
NO, WAS IT FUNNY?</i>

362
00:32:53,859 --> 00:32:59,163
OKAY, HERE IT IS.
OKAY, I GOT 'EM, I GOT 'EM.

363
00:33:03,735 --> 00:33:07,938
I'VE GOT ONE MORE, THOUGH,
SO WAIT.

364
00:33:11,943 --> 00:33:15,612
GREAT, OKAY.
I GOT 'EM, I GOT 'EM.

365
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:19,850
WHOA!

366
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,143
FRONT DOOR!
FRONT DOOR!

367
00:34:31,823 --> 00:34:35,392
LET'S GO.

368
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,196
<i>SEE IF YOU GET IT.
YOU GOT IT.</i>

369
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,371
GOT ANYTHING?
NOT YET.

370
00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:05,889
OKAY, I GOT YOU.

371
00:35:05,957 --> 00:35:10,227
SHIT! THIS WAY, THIS WAY!

372
00:35:46,097 --> 00:35:50,834
THIS IS SIMON.
THERE WAS A SMALL FIRE
IN THE ART ROOM. OVER.

373
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:54,204
YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY
A CHEMICAL REACTION
TO SOMETHING.

374
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:56,907
COPY THAT. OVER.

375
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,480
DID YOU SEE THAT?

376
00:36:16,561 --> 00:36:19,796
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM.
I FOUND MORE CANDLES.

377
00:36:19,864 --> 00:36:22,500
YOU AND YOUR FUCKING WEED.
YOU'RE A TEA HEAD.

378
00:36:25,904 --> 00:36:28,639
WHERE WERE YOU GUYS?

379
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,250
WE NEED MORE CANDLES.

380
00:36:39,317 --> 00:36:42,153
WHERE'D YOU GET
ALL THESE CANDLES?

381
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,189
LOOK, IT'S A SHRINE.
WHERE'D YOU FIND THESE?

382
00:36:45,257 --> 00:36:48,892
WAS IT LAYING AROUND
IN THIS HOUSE?
WE'RE LIKE WITCHES HERE.

383
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:52,563
<i>CRAZY SHIT.
THAT'S RIGHT.</i>

384
00:36:56,101 --> 00:36:58,902
OH, MY GOD.
WHOO.

385
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:04,141
<i>WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?
CHECK OUT HER POUCH.</i>

386
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:07,344
I'M COMMEMORATING TONIGHT.

387
00:38:12,144 --> 00:38:15,579
THIS IS SO
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER TONIGHT,

388
00:38:15,647 --> 00:38:17,648
AND YOU, MADDY.

389
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:23,521
AND GOLDIE.

390
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,791
AND VIOLET.

391
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:32,729
AND RED.

392
00:39:12,337 --> 00:39:14,405
¶ STILL ¶

393
00:39:16,641 --> 00:39:19,443

FIRE?

397
00:39:34,526 --> 00:39:39,162
BECAUSE IT NOURISHES,
AND ALSO DESTROYS
IF YOU DON'T RESPECT IT.

398
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:43,066
THAT'S HOW WE WERE TONIGHT.

399
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:49,440
¶ BESIDE ME ¶

400
00:39:50,842 --> 00:39:53,344

¶ LIKE TWO STRANGERS ¶

405
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:27,444
¶ TURNING INTO DUST ¶

406
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:33,216
¶ 'TIL MY HAND SHOOK ¶

407
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:38,989
¶ AWAY A FEW ¶

408
00:40:45,163 --> 00:40:47,197
DO IT TO ME.

409
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:12,523
¶ I COULD POSSIBLY
BE FADING ¶

410
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:18,161
¶ OR HAVE ¶

411
00:41:18,229 --> 00:41:23,367
¶ SOMETHING MORE TO GAIN ¶

412
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:31,542
¶ I COULD FEEL MYSELF ¶

¶ GROWING COLDER ¶

414
00:41:37,982 --> 00:41:42,353
¶ I COULD FEEL MYSELF ¶

415
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,022
HOLD STILL, OKAY?

416
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:52,062
DON'T BE SCARED.

417
00:41:53,998 --> 00:41:56,032
¶ UNDER ¶

418
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:04,608
¶ YOUR FAME ¶

419
00:42:18,256 --> 00:42:21,892
¶ IT WAS YOU ¶

420
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:27,197
¶ BREATHLESS, I'M TOLD ¶

421
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:37,441
¶ I COULD FEEL MY EYES

422
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:49,352
¶ AND TWO STRANGERS
TURNING INTO DUST ¶

423
00:42:56,193 --> 00:43:00,997
¶ TURNING INTO DUST ¶

424
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:40,203
OW.

425
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:43,373
OW.

426
00:43:46,878 --> 00:43:49,980
OH, MY GOD.
IS IT... DONE?

427
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:52,048
IT'S BEAUTIFUL!

428
00:43:52,116 --> 00:43:57,320
I LOVE IT!
WE'RE LIKE THOSE GIRLS
WHO RUN WITH FOXES.

429
00:43:57,388 --> 00:43:59,623
YOU'RE SUCH A GEEK!

430
00:43:59,691 --> 00:44:03,460
WE'RE LIKE THOSE GEEKS
THAT RUN WITH FOXES.

431
00:44:03,528 --> 00:44:06,697
I'M A RUNAWAY GEEK,
GODDAMN IT!

432
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:12,495
HEY.
HEY.

433
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,135
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
OUR PORTFOLIOS.
YOU FORGOT?

434
00:45:19,203 --> 00:45:21,805
NO, I REMEMBER.

435
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:28,078
I JUST DON'T HAVE MINE.
IT'S NOT AT MY HOUSE.

436
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:41,658
WHAT'S UP?
HEY.

437
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,346
WHAT IS THIS?

438
00:46:03,414 --> 00:46:08,118
IT'S A--
I GOT A TATTOO LAST NIGHT.

439
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:13,323
YOU'RE PISSED.

440
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:16,526
NO! I'M HAPPY THAT
YOU BEAT UP A TEACHER,

441
00:46:16,594 --> 00:46:19,796
YOU GOT A TATTOO,
STOOD ME UP.

442
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:27,838
HIT YOUR HEAD
OR SOMETHING LATELY?
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

443
00:46:32,543 --> 00:46:36,747
YOU SHOULD JUST DO
YOUR PORTFOLIO AND GET IT IN.
I'LL DO MINE ALONE.

444
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,217
HEY!

445
00:46:41,285 --> 00:46:43,854
WE'RE HANGING OUT TONIGHT,
RIGHT?

446
00:46:43,921 --> 00:46:45,889
OKAY.

447
00:46:52,797 --> 00:46:57,500
WHY DO YOU KEEP DOIN' THIS?
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF FREAK?

448
00:46:57,568 --> 00:47:00,637
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?

449
00:47:00,705 --> 00:47:04,440
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY RESPECT
FOR YOURSELF?

450
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:08,378
THIS ROOM LOOKS LIKE
A DRUG DEN.

451
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:11,347
I WANT THESE CANDLES OUT OF HERE
BEFORE YOU BURN THE HOUSE DOWN.

452
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:14,918
DAN, DAN.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

453
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:24,494
SO, WE'LL BE AT THE
MEDICAL CONVENTION IN MIAMI.
REMEMBER?

454
00:47:24,562 --> 00:47:26,763
THE NUMBER'S ON THE FRIDGE.

455
00:47:26,831 --> 00:47:29,199
DON'T FORGET TO FEED
THE BIRD, HUH?

456
00:47:31,468 --> 00:47:35,072
OH, THERE'S A GIRL
OR WHATEVER TO SEE YOU.

457
00:47:40,477 --> 00:47:44,081
HONEY, YOU WANT ME
TO STAY HOME WITH HER?

458
00:47:44,148 --> 00:47:47,684
SHE'S 17. SHE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO TAKE CARE OF HERSELF.

459
00:48:10,341 --> 00:48:12,943
¶ TAKING AWAY MY SOUL
MY SOUL ¶

460
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:17,781
¶ HEY, ENERGY SUCKER ¶

461
00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:23,386

462
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:28,225
¶ HEY ¶

463
00:48:28,292 --> 00:48:30,526
¶ YOUR SOUL IS ¶

464
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:34,697
<i>I GOTTA PEE!</i>

465
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:37,467
<i>WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S A CUT.</i>

466
00:48:37,534 --> 00:48:40,003
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUT?
GET OUT. GET OUT!

467
00:48:40,071 --> 00:48:42,873
GET DRESSED. WE'RE GONNA
BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.
I'M GETTING A RIDE...

468
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,675
WITH A FRIEND.

469
00:48:45,743 --> 00:48:48,178
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY FRIENDS!

470
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:29,786
MY STASH.

471
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:32,622
THAT SHIT CAN KILL YOU.

472
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:36,726
SO CAN ASPIRINS.
IT ONLY TAKES 60 ASPIRINS
TO KILL YOURSELF.

473
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:42,365
HEY. PUT THAT MONEY BACK,
YOUNG LADY.

474
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:44,968
FIRST YOU GOTTA TAKE
THE SAFETY OFF.

475
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:48,738
PUT IT BACK.

476
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:52,943
GO AHEAD.

477
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:55,812
PUT ME OUT OF MY MISERY.

478
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:14,797
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

479
00:50:25,776 --> 00:50:30,480
IF I HEAR ANY MORE SHIT
ABOUT 60 ASPIRINS OR ONE MORE
OF YOUR FUCKIN' MOOD SWINGS,

480
00:50:30,547 --> 00:50:34,417
I'M GOING TO TICKLE YOU
TO DEATH!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME, HUH?

481
00:50:34,485 --> 00:50:37,220
YES, MA'AM.
HEY, COME HERE.

482
00:50:45,796 --> 00:50:48,631
<i>HELLO?
COME IN.</i>

483
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:56,406
DID YOU BRING YOUR LUNCH?
NO. HOW ARE YOU?
HI.

484
00:50:56,473 --> 00:50:58,641
HI.

485
00:51:00,177 --> 00:51:02,279
SOMETHING TO EAT?
NO.

486
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:07,884
I BROUGHT CHARLIE DEEN,
THE GALLOPING MACHINE.
WHOO-WHEE!

487
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:10,353
OH, MAN! FIGURES.

488
00:51:10,421 --> 00:51:13,556
I GOT IT IN SECOND GRADE.
THIS I BROUGHT TOO.

489
00:51:20,631 --> 00:51:23,967
I BROUGHT ANOTHER CANDLE,
BUT IT'S NICER THAN THE OTHERS.

490
00:51:40,684 --> 00:51:43,653
THAT ONE'S MY FAVORITE.

491
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,490
I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHAT I
WANNA DO WITH THIS ONE YET.

492
00:51:47,558 --> 00:51:49,692
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LEAVE IT
LIKE THAT? IT'S NICE.

493
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,861
I DON'T KNOW.

494
00:51:51,929 --> 00:51:56,399
HEY! HEY! HEY!
YOU WILL NOT BELIEVE WHAT I GOT.
READ IT.

495
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:58,935
<i>OPEN IT.</i>

496
00:51:59,003 --> 00:52:03,440
"DEAR VIOLET,
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

I OWE YOU MY LIFE.</i>

498
00:52:07,845 --> 00:52:12,582

AFTER ME LATELY,
BUT HE WON'T ANYMORE.

00:52:35,672 --> 00:52:42,612
<i>¶ LET'S DO SOME STUFF

507
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:46,149

515
00:53:22,053 --> 00:53:25,688
SO THIS IS HEADQUARTERS.

516
00:53:35,732 --> 00:53:38,134
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

517
00:53:38,202 --> 00:53:41,571
WE HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM,
GIRLS.
IT'S CALLED LLOYD BUTTINGER.

518
00:53:41,638 --> 00:53:43,540
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

519
00:53:43,607 --> 00:53:48,644
THIS NASTY RUMOR GOT STARTED
AND NOW THESE GIRLS ARE SIGNING
A PETITION TO HAVE HIM FIRED.

520
00:53:48,712 --> 00:53:50,280
WOW.

521
00:53:50,347 --> 00:53:52,815
WHAT'S YOUR POINT, DANA?

522
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:56,619
OUR POINT IS
YOU GIRLS STARTED IT,

523
00:53:56,687 --> 00:54:01,424
<i>SO YOU'D BETTER STOP IT.
OR, WHAT, BIG GUY?</i>

524
00:54:01,492 --> 00:54:03,426
<i>OR YOU'LL BE FUCKING SORRY.</i>

525
00:54:03,494 --> 00:54:07,830
IF COACH BUTTINGER LOSES
HIS JOB 'CAUSE OF YOU SLUTS,

526
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:11,901
YOU'LL PAY.

527
00:54:11,969 --> 00:54:14,003
SHUT UP, DANA.

528
00:54:14,071 --> 00:54:17,373
THAT'S PRETTY BIG TALK, DANA.

529
00:54:19,943 --> 00:54:23,746
YOU KNOW, VIOLET,
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT.

530
00:54:23,814 --> 00:54:27,550
THAT'S FUNNY, DANA,
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOU TOO.

531
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:32,222
OH, YEAH, THAT FUZZY
LITTLE HEAD OF YOURS
BURIED BETWEEN MY THIGHS...

532
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:34,124
JUST BLOWIN' AWAY
AT WHAT YOU LOVE BEST.

533
00:54:34,191 --> 00:54:38,228
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ALL
YOUR FRIENDS HERE HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE THE WAY IT TASTES?

534
00:54:38,295 --> 00:54:40,563
IN YOUR FUCKIN' DREAMS!

535
00:54:40,631 --> 00:54:43,366
DANA, WHY DON'T YOU
AND YOUR LITTLE BOYS HERE...

536
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:48,238
RUN BACK TO COACH BUTTINGER
AND TELL HIM HE DESERVES
WHATEVER THE HELL HE GETS?

537
00:54:49,507 --> 00:54:52,074
LET'S GO, MAN, COME ON.

538
00:54:57,981 --> 00:55:01,884
SO, IS IT TRUE,
THE STUFF ABOUT BUTTINGER?

539
00:55:01,952 --> 00:55:03,786
YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

540
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:07,590
HEY, BOBBY?

541
00:55:07,658 --> 00:55:09,659
DO YOU KNOW RITA?

542
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:15,765
- YOU'RE IN MY FRENCH CLASS,
RIGHT?
- OUI.

543
00:55:15,832 --> 00:55:18,734
<i>OUI?</i>

544
00:55:18,802 --> 00:55:21,070
<i>BOBBY?</i>

545
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:28,144
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

546
00:55:31,282 --> 00:55:34,083
<i>BON SOIR, BOBBY.</i>

547
00:55:34,151 --> 00:55:36,186
GOOD NIGHT.

548
00:55:36,253 --> 00:55:38,888
SEE YA.

549
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:45,662
I'M SUCH A HOPELESS ROMANTIC.
SO PERFECT.

550
00:55:45,729 --> 00:55:47,763
<i>SO GREAT.
OUI.</i>

551
00:55:47,831 --> 00:55:49,499
OUI.

552
00:55:51,134 --> 00:55:53,469
<i>IT'S LIKE PANTYHOSE.
YOU HAVE TO UNROLL IT.</i>

553
00:55:53,536 --> 00:55:55,838
LIKE THIS.
OKAY?

554
00:55:55,906 --> 00:56:00,776
YEAH, BUT AM I THE ONE
THAT'S GONNA HAVE TO ACTUALLY
PUT IT ON AND DO IT?

555
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:02,745
IT'S MORE FUN
THAT WAY.

556
00:56:02,812 --> 00:56:06,215
WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?
TALKING ABOUT PENISES.

557
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:08,684
GOD! WHAT FLAVOR?

558
00:56:08,752 --> 00:56:10,686
THIS IS CONDOM 101.

559
00:56:10,754 --> 00:56:14,357
NOW, WE'LL GET INTO FLAVORS
NEXT WEEK.

560
00:56:18,228 --> 00:56:21,898
HOW DO YOU KNOW A GUY'S GOT
A REALLY BIG... "SHLONG"...

561
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:23,866
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY--

562
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:26,235
YOU GET AN EYE FOR IT.

563
00:56:38,382 --> 00:56:41,317
OKAY, SMARTIE.

564
00:56:41,385 --> 00:56:44,820
WHAT ABOUT--
NO, NOT HIM.

565
00:56:44,888 --> 00:56:47,589
HIM.
THAT GUY OVER THERE.
HIM?

566
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:49,926
VIOLET!

567
00:56:49,993 --> 00:56:53,029
STOP THAT!
THE GUY RIGHT THERE?

568
00:56:53,096 --> 00:56:56,299
VIOLET! STOP IT!
BUSHEL OF POTATOES.
DOUBLE MEAT!

569
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:01,637
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IF A GUY'S GOOD IN BED?

570
00:57:01,704 --> 00:57:05,174
BY HOW MANY TIMES
HE MAKES ME COME.

571
00:57:05,242 --> 00:57:09,478
¶ DO YOU WANNA COME

572
00:57:09,546 --> 00:57:13,582

I WROTE THAT MYSELF.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

576
00:57:25,963 --> 00:57:29,765
I... THINK YOU NEED
TO GET LAID.

577
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:32,701
I KNOW.
I MASTURBATE, THOUGH.

578
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:34,503
AM I GONNA HEAR
ABOUT IT?

579
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:37,906
OH, IS OUR LITTLE BALD ONE
NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE ART OF...

580
00:57:37,975 --> 00:57:41,777
AUTO... EROTIC...
EXHILARATION?

581
00:57:41,845 --> 00:57:47,049
¶ SHE IS MY ADDICTION ¶

582
00:57:47,117 --> 00:57:51,620

STUPID REDHEAD.

592
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:36,832
GUYS, I'M AFRAID
OF HEIGHTS...

593
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,769
BUT I'M NOT AFRAID OF GETTING
HIGH.
I'M AFRAID OF AN ISLAND
WITH NO BOYS ON IT.

594
00:58:40,837 --> 00:58:43,105
ARE YOU AFRAID OF ANYTHING?
I'M AFRAID OF LEGS
IN A DRESS.

595
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:45,508
I'M AFRAID OF MYSELF.

596
00:58:46,676 --> 00:58:50,946
¶ SHE IS THE ESSENCE OF ME ¶

597
00:59:00,157 --> 00:59:04,326

¶ HEADIN' FOR A SPIN ¶

602
00:59:28,351 --> 00:59:31,720
I HAVE BEEN OUT ALL NIGHT...
LOOKING FOR YOU.

603
00:59:31,788 --> 00:59:34,623
<i>GET IN THE CAR.</i>

604
00:59:49,573 --> 00:59:51,640
THE SON--
LEGS, IT'S OKAY.

605
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:54,910
NO, IT'S NOT.

606
01:00:29,979 --> 01:00:32,047
WHO'S AUDREY?

607
01:00:32,115 --> 01:00:34,150
A FRIEND.

608
01:00:40,157 --> 01:00:42,158
AUDREY'S MY MOM.

609
01:00:48,665 --> 01:00:50,599
HOW?

610
01:00:50,667 --> 01:00:53,402
IN A CAR.
SHE WAS DRUNK.

611
01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:56,071
I'M SORRY.

612
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:58,541
YEAH, ME TOO.

613
01:01:00,277 --> 01:01:02,744
<i>DO YOU HAVE A DAD?</i>

614
01:01:02,812 --> 01:01:05,614
YEAH,
SOMEWHERE I DO.

615
01:01:12,622 --> 01:01:15,957
MADDY, I'M THINKING
ABOUT MOVING ON
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS.

616
01:01:20,063 --> 01:01:21,997
TO WHERE?

617
01:01:22,065 --> 01:01:24,333
TO WHEREVER.

618
01:01:24,401 --> 01:01:26,902
SOMEWHERE.

619
01:01:31,908 --> 01:01:35,311
DO YOU HAVE
TO GO ALONE?

620
01:01:35,378 --> 01:01:39,682
AH, WOULD YOU TAKE SOMEONE
WITH YOU?

621
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:45,087
IS THAT SOMEONE SURE?

622
01:01:45,154 --> 01:01:48,990
HMM? IS SHE CUT OUT
FOR THE UNKNOWN?

623
01:01:57,867 --> 01:02:02,705
SOMETIMES THE UNKNOWN
WILL DISAPPOINT YOU.

624
01:02:17,787 --> 01:02:20,922
IF I TOLD YOU THAT
I LOVED YOU, WOULD YOU
TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY?

625
01:02:24,127 --> 01:02:26,762
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY "WRONG"?

626
01:02:34,604 --> 01:02:38,474
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M NOT--

627
01:02:42,078 --> 01:02:45,213
AND YOU'RE--

628
01:02:45,282 --> 01:02:49,217
HMM. GEEZ.

629
01:02:49,286 --> 01:02:52,755
I'LL TAKE IT
HOWEVER YOU WANT ME TO, MADDY.

630
01:03:38,935 --> 01:03:41,937
HMM. HMM.

631
01:03:52,382 --> 01:03:55,317
HMM. LOOK.

632
01:03:56,252 --> 01:03:58,854
YOU CAN SEE SPICA
IN VIRGO.

633
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:05,160
SUMMER'S ON ITS WAY.

634
01:05:01,684 --> 01:05:03,852
MADDY.

635
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,222
HI.
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

636
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:17,399
I'M SCARED.

637
01:05:18,768 --> 01:05:22,003
DANA AND I
GOT IN THIS FIGHT...

638
01:05:22,071 --> 01:05:26,875
AND HE STARTED PUSHING ME
AND HITTING ME.

639
01:05:26,943 --> 01:05:31,212
I TOOK OFF ON HIM, BUT, UM,
HE'S OUT LOOKING FOR ME.

640
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,549
AND I'M SORT OF SCARED
TO WALK HOME ALONE.

641
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:37,385
WHY'D YOU COME HERE?

642
01:05:37,454 --> 01:05:40,989
YOU GUYS JUST SORT
OF HAVE THIS REPUTATION.

643
01:05:41,057 --> 01:05:43,592
I WAS KIND OF HOPING
YOU'D HELP ME OUT.

644
01:05:53,636 --> 01:05:55,270
THANKS FOR DOING THIS.

645
01:05:55,338 --> 01:05:59,274
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
I'D DO IT FOR ANY GIRL.

646
01:06:00,977 --> 01:06:03,979
YOU GUYS REALLY MESSED UP
BUTTINGER.

647
01:06:04,046 --> 01:06:07,349
YOU KNOW,
THEY FIRED HIM.
HE DESERVED IT.

648
01:06:07,416 --> 01:06:10,786
I KNOW.
BUT DANA SAYS
IT'S ALL BULL.

649
01:06:10,854 --> 01:06:14,356
"DANA SAYS.
DANA SAYS."

650
01:06:14,423 --> 01:06:16,758
GOD, CINDY,
GET A MIND OF YOUR OWN!

651
01:06:28,738 --> 01:06:31,640
MADDY, I CAN GO THE REST
OF THE WAY ALONE.
IT'S OKAY.

652
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:34,843
IT'S OKAY.
LAUREL'S NOT FAR.
YEAH, BUT--

653
01:06:34,911 --> 01:06:36,845
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

654
01:06:36,913 --> 01:06:39,180
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

655
01:06:42,552 --> 01:06:45,954
WE'LL TAKE OVER
FROM HERE, BABE.
LET'S JUST FORGET IT.

656
01:06:46,022 --> 01:06:50,091
- WHY DON'T WE GO FOR A RIDE?
- YOU WATCH TOO MANY
CORNY MOVIES.

657
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:52,961
YEAH? WE THINK YOU GIRLS
ARE GETTIN' A LITTLE
TOO BIG FOR YOURSELVES.

658
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:55,096
OH, YEAH?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT IT?

659
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:58,033
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WANTING
ME TO DO FOR A LONG TIME.

660
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,469
CINDY KNOWS YOU HAVE.
THAT'S WHY SHE'S COMIN'.

661
01:07:01,538 --> 01:07:04,305
<i>SHE'S A WITNESS.
ONE GIRL'S WORD
AGAINST ANOTHER.</i>

662
01:07:04,373 --> 01:07:07,275
<i>MAYBE THIS IS
JUST A BAD IDEA.</i>

663
01:07:07,343 --> 01:07:09,811
WE'RE JUST GONNA FUCK AROUND.
WHY DON'T YOU GET IN THE CAR?

664
01:07:09,879 --> 01:07:12,848
OOH, WE GOT A FIGHTER HERE.
GET HER IN THE CAR.
FUCK OFF! CINDY!

665

01:09:55,277 --> 01:09:58,180
LEGS, TALK TO ME.

704
01:09:58,247 --> 01:10:00,315
I DON'T LIKE
POLICE STATIONS.

705
01:10:24,406 --> 01:10:26,942
CARJACKING.
RESISTING ARREST.

706
01:10:27,009 --> 01:10:30,311
<i>ASSAULT WITH
A DEADLY WEAPON.</i>

707
01:10:30,379 --> 01:10:32,680

FROM IT.</i>

709
01:10:35,384 --> 01:10:38,920
I'M GOING TO TURN YOU OVER

<i>THEY, BETTER THAN I,
KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU.</i>

<i>NOW, MARGARET SADOVSKY.</i>

713
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:51,366
I THINK SOME ADULT GUIDANCE,
SUPERVISION...

714
01:10:51,433 --> 01:10:53,468
<i>COULD BENEFIT YOU TOO,
YOUNG LADY.</i>

715
01:10:53,535 --> 01:10:57,605
- BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO LEGAL
GUARDIAN-- IS THAT RIGHT?
- YES.

716
01:10:57,673 --> 01:11:01,509
<i>AND BECAUSE YOU APPEAR
TO BE THE MOST CULPABLE
OF THE DEFENDANTS...</i>

717
01:11:01,577 --> 01:11:03,945
<i>AND HAVE
A PREVIOUS RECORD,</i>

718
01:11:04,013 --> 01:11:08,850

<i>NO, YOU CAN'T
DO THIS.
BE QUIET.</i>

721
01:11:13,389 --> 01:11:16,858
<i>YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. SHE WAS
JUST TRYING TO PROTECT ME.
THAT'S ENOUGH OUT OF YOU!</i>

722
01:11:16,926 --> 01:11:20,561
NO! WE'RE TELLING THE TRUTH!
YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.
THEY'RE THE ONES THAT LIED.

723
01:11:20,629 --> 01:11:22,630
<i>THEY LIED! THEY LIED!

01:11:22,698 --> 01:11:26,201
<i>TELL THE TRUTH! THERE'S NO
JUSTICE!
WATCH YOUR MOUTH
IN MY COURTROOM.</i>

725

YOU HEAR ME?

730
01:11:56,098 --> 01:11:58,266
MAYBE SHE'S BETTER OFF,
MADDY.

731
01:12:00,036 --> 01:12:02,337

802
01:17:20,706 --> 01:17:24,142
IF YOU SEE HER,
YOU TELL HER TO GET HOME.

803
01:17:28,747 --> 01:17:31,950
<i>WHAT?

01:18:57,904 --> 01:19:01,106
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

821
01:19:01,173 --> 01:19:03,875
HERE'S SOME PUDDING.
I CAN'T.

822

WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL A DOCTOR.

826
01:19:19,091 --> 01:19:21,726
NO, IT'LL JUST
GET HER IN TROUBLE.
GET OUT OF HERE.

827
01:19:21,794 --> 01:19:25,130
I'LL STAY WITH HER TONIGHT.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
GET THE FUCK OUT!

828
01:19:25,197 --> 01:19:28,133
I'LL STAY.
IT'S OKAY.
FUCK!

829
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:31,369
WE SHOULD GO.
I'LL WALK YOU HOME.

830
01:19:31,437 --> 01:19:35,540
LEAVE ME ALONE!
MADDY,
I'LL BE BACK LATER.

831
01:19:35,607 --> 01:19:38,443
FUCK.

832
01:19:39,711 --> 01:19:42,080
IN LINE!
IN LINE!

833
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:38,336
LEGS?
SHIT! YOU GUYS!

834
01:20:38,404 --> 01:20:41,606
OH, LEGS!

835
01:20:45,077 --> 01:20:48,713
<i>OH. HEY, LADY.</i>

836
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:51,282
HI.

837
01:20:52,584 --> 01:20:55,820
OH, THANK GOD
YOU'RE BACK.

838
01:21:00,592 --> 01:21:02,660
HI.

839
01:21:02,728 --> 01:21:04,695
HI.

840
01:21:15,441 --> 01:21:17,375
WHAT'S WRONG?

841
01:21:17,443 --> 01:21:20,145
IT'S GOLDIE.

842
01:21:20,212 --> 01:21:22,080
WHAT?

843
01:21:22,148 --> 01:21:25,950
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.

844
01:21:27,786 --> 01:21:29,787
SHE'S SICK.

845
01:21:42,768 --> 01:21:44,769
OH.

846
01:22:01,387 --> 01:22:03,688
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN
LIKE THIS?
TWO DAYS.

847
01:22:03,755 --> 01:22:06,524
SHE THROWING UP?
SHE WAS.

848
01:22:08,194 --> 01:22:11,162
LEGS, WHAT'RE WE
GONNA DO?

849
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:28,413
YES?

850
01:22:28,481 --> 01:22:31,449
WE'RE HERE
ABOUT GOLDIE.

851
01:22:33,619 --> 01:22:36,754
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I MEAN, WHERE IS SHE?
SHE'S IN TROUBLE.

852
01:22:36,822 --> 01:22:39,390
WE NEED $10,000 FROM YOU
TO HELP HER.

853
01:22:42,194 --> 01:22:44,962
SO WHAT IN THE HELL
HAS SHE DONE NOW?

854
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:47,298
<i>IT'S FOR REHAB.</i>

855
01:22:47,366 --> 01:22:49,501
GOLDIE HAS
A DRUG PROBLEM.

856
01:22:49,568 --> 01:22:53,638
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- SHE'S SICK.

857
01:22:53,705 --> 01:22:55,906
YOU TELL ME WHERE SHE IS
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.

858
01:22:55,974 --> 01:22:57,908
NO, I THINK
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH.

859
01:22:57,976 --> 01:23:01,346
I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE,
BUT I'M HER FATHER.

860
01:23:05,184 --> 01:23:07,452
- DIDN'T THEY SEND YOU AWAY?
- FUCK YOU!

861
01:23:09,522 --> 01:23:12,757
GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!
NO, NOT WITHOUT
THE MONEY.

862
01:23:15,894 --> 01:23:17,995
- WHERE IS SHE?
- NO.

863
01:23:18,063 --> 01:23:21,332
- MAYBE YOU'D LIKE
TO TELL THE POLICE.
- WHY DON'T WE CALL THE POLICE?

864
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:25,036
WHY DON'T WE CALL THE POLICE
AND TELL THEM
WHAT A LOUSY FATHER YOU ARE?

865
01:23:25,103 --> 01:23:27,938
AND THAT THEY SHOULD
LOCK YOU UP
FOR BEATING YOUR DAUGHTER.

866
01:23:28,006 --> 01:23:29,840
WHAT?

867
01:23:29,908 --> 01:23:32,644
I NEVER BEAT HER.
IS THAT WHAT SHE TOLD YOU?

868
01:23:32,711 --> 01:23:35,980
STOP... BLAMING HER
FOR EVERYTHING!

869
01:23:39,751 --> 01:23:42,887
YOU GONNA GIVE US THE MONEY
OR NOT?

870
01:23:44,723 --> 01:23:47,659
I WANT YOU, YOU AND YOU
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

871
01:23:47,726 --> 01:23:49,827
NOW!

872
01:23:49,895 --> 01:23:51,862
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

873
01:23:53,265 --> 01:23:55,400
PUT THE PHONE DOWN.

874
01:23:57,203 --> 01:23:59,904
PUT IT DOWN!

875
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,975
YOU GIVE US $10,000 RIGHT NOW
OR YOU'RE COMING WITH US.

876
01:24:05,043 --> 01:24:08,379
- PUT THE GUN DOWN.
- OR WHAT, MADDY?
IT'S NOT LOADED.

877
01:24:08,447 --> 01:24:12,317
WHAT KIND OF ASSHOLE
WOULD KEEP A LOADED GUN
IN THE HOUSE?

878
01:24:12,384 --> 01:24:16,688
- WAIT!
- NO! NOT UNTIL HE GIVES ME
THE MONEY!

879
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:22,793
COME ON.
SHIT. GET THE KEYS, MADDY.

880
01:24:22,861 --> 01:24:24,829
<i>PICK THEM UP
OFF THE TABLE.
MADDY--</i>

881
01:24:24,896 --> 01:24:29,767
PICK THEM UP, MADDY, NOW!
COME ON, LET'S GO.

882
01:24:29,835 --> 01:24:34,171
<i>- GIRLS, PLEASE.
- MOVE! YOU MOVE!</i>

883
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,488
MADDY, DRIVE.

884
01:24:50,556 --> 01:24:52,923
LET'S JUST TALK
ABOUT THIS.
GET IN THE FUCKIN' CAR.

885
01:24:52,991 --> 01:24:55,493
ALL RIGHT.

886
01:25:04,035 --> 01:25:07,305
<i>LEGS, WE CAN'T DO THIS.
WILL YOU JUST DRIVE?</i>

887
01:25:07,373 --> 01:25:09,474
<i>THIS IS CRAZY!
DON'T CHOKE ON ME,
MADDY!</i>

888
01:25:09,541 --> 01:25:11,976
YOU DON'T HAVE TO OBEY HER,
MADDY. YOU CAN PULL
THE CAR OVER.

889
01:25:12,043 --> 01:25:15,112
SHUT UP!
JUST DRIVE TO THE HOUSE.

890
01:25:17,215 --> 01:25:20,951
<i>WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH HIM?
DON'T KNOW.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.</i>

891
01:25:21,019 --> 01:25:22,754
MADDY!
MADDY?

892
01:25:22,821 --> 01:25:25,122
- SHIT! I'M GONNA PULL OVER.
- NO, YOU'RE NOT!

893
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:27,091
<i>I WON'T PRESS CHARGES.
I SWEAR.</i>

894
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:29,160
I WILL KILL YOU.
I DON'T CARE.

895
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:40,571
OK-- O-OKAY.

896
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,776
LOOK, WE'RE JUST GONNA
CALM DOWN. OKAY?

897
01:25:50,816 --> 01:25:52,917
<i>I'M JUST GONNA DRIVE.</i>

898
01:26:07,899 --> 01:26:11,268
GET OUT!

899
01:26:12,771 --> 01:26:15,707
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO
WITH HIM, LEGS?
JUST GET IN.

900
01:26:18,276 --> 01:26:21,178
WHERE'S GOLDIE?
SHE'S IN HERE.
SHE'S AWAKE.

901
01:26:21,246 --> 01:26:23,247
GO UPSTAIRS.
COULD I HAVE SOME HELP?

902
01:26:25,718 --> 01:26:28,252
MADDY SAYS IT'S OKAY.
LET'S GO!

903
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,355
CAN YOU MOVE?

904
01:26:36,061 --> 01:26:38,796
WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED?

905
01:26:42,501 --> 01:26:44,502
SIT.

906
01:26:44,570 --> 01:26:46,771
COME ON, SIT.

907
01:26:49,074 --> 01:26:51,208
<i>HELP ME TIE HIM UP.</i>

908
01:26:52,978 --> 01:26:54,945
<i>COME ON!</i>

909
01:26:57,048 --> 01:26:59,049
TAKE YOUR SOCKS OFF.

910
01:27:07,626 --> 01:27:11,763
RED, GIMME YOU HAND.
YOU'LL BE OKAY.
I'M JUST GONNA THINK.

911
01:27:11,830 --> 01:27:14,098
OKAY?
HOLD IT ON HIM.

912
01:27:25,878 --> 01:27:29,514
TALK TO ME.
TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

913
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:43,127
WE'RE GONNA CALL HIS WIFE
AND MAKE HER DROP OFF THE MONEY.

914
01:27:43,194 --> 01:27:45,663
- RANSOM?
- THAT'S KIDNAPPING!

915
01:27:45,731 --> 01:27:48,165
THAT'S JUST A WORD, MADDY.
DON'T LET IT SCARE YOU.

916
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:51,135
YOU'RE WHAT'S SCARING ME.

917
01:28:02,013 --> 01:28:05,015
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE HIM DO
THE RIGHT THING.

918
01:28:05,083 --> 01:28:07,051
- NOT THIS WAY.
- HOW?

919
01:28:08,654 --> 01:28:12,990
- HE BROUGHT THIS ON HIMSELF.
- HE IS NOT THE POINT!
WE ARE!

920
01:28:13,826 --> 01:28:15,660
<i>GOD--</i>

921
01:28:15,727 --> 01:28:19,464
<i>WE'RE THE ONES
WHO LIVE HERE.
THEY'RE GONNA FIND US.</i>

922
01:28:19,531 --> 01:28:21,766
AND WHEN THEY DO,
WE'RE THE ONE'S
WHO ARE GONNA PAY FOR THIS.

923
01:28:21,834 --> 01:28:24,034
LIKE LAST TIME?

924
01:28:26,738 --> 01:28:28,873
HUH?

925
01:28:37,516 --> 01:28:41,118
<i>COME ON. THIS IS--
THIS IS FOR GOLDIE.</i>

926
01:28:42,888 --> 01:28:45,222
THIS IS ABOUT
SAVING HER LIFE.

927
01:28:47,392 --> 01:28:50,327
AND WHO WE ARE
TO HER.

928
01:28:54,933 --> 01:28:57,602
IT'S ABOUT WHO WE ARE.

929
01:28:59,304 --> 01:29:03,040
- YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG.
- YEAH? WELL I DON'T SEE YOU
DOIN' IT RIGHT.

930
01:29:03,108 --> 01:29:06,944
THIS IS CRAZY!
THERE'S GOTTA BE ANOTHER WAY
TO GO ABOUT THIS.

931
01:29:09,982 --> 01:29:13,484
- SO WHAT IS IT, RED? HMM?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS.

932
01:29:13,552 --> 01:29:17,755
YEAH? YEAH, WELL,
I'M OUT OF IDEAS.

933
01:29:17,823 --> 01:29:19,790
<i>COME ON, LEGS.</i>

934
01:29:19,858 --> 01:29:23,027
I WANT HIM
TO SEE GOLDIE.

935
01:29:23,094 --> 01:29:27,398
HE DOESN'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT GOLDIE.
HE'S HER FATHER!

936
01:29:27,465 --> 01:29:29,767
<i>LEGS, SHE'S RIGHT.</i>

937
01:29:32,771 --> 01:29:34,772
YOU KNOW WHAT?

938
01:29:35,741 --> 01:29:39,410
FATHERS MEAN NOTHING!

939
01:29:40,812 --> 01:29:44,448
THEY DON'T CARE.
THEY MEAN NOTHING.

940
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,122
LEGS, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT YOU.

941
01:29:57,529 --> 01:30:00,364
MAYBE HE'LL COME THROUGH
FOR HER THIS TIME.

942
01:30:02,834 --> 01:30:05,937
WHAT THE FUCK
IS GOING ON?

943
01:30:08,774 --> 01:30:11,208
- SOMEONE CALL AN AMBULANCE!
- DAD!

944
01:30:11,276 --> 01:30:14,979
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
VIOLET, UNTIE HIS HANDS.

945
01:30:15,047 --> 01:30:17,982
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
GOLDIE, IT'S OKAY.
IT WENT CLEAN THROUGH.

946
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:20,451
<i>WE HAVE TO STOP
THIS BLEEDING.</i>

947
01:30:20,518 --> 01:30:22,286
HE'S OKAY.
IT WENT CLEAN THROUGH.

948
01:30:22,353 --> 01:30:24,121
OH, SHIT!
RED!

949
01:30:24,189 --> 01:30:26,724
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
THE GUN WENT OFF.

950
01:30:26,792 --> 01:30:29,093
IT'S MY FAULT.
LOOK AT ME!
IT'S MY FAULT.

951
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,096
OKAY?
IT'S MY FAULT.
GOLDIE,
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

952
01:30:32,163 --> 01:30:35,600
WE'VE GOTTA GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
CAN YOU TAKE THE GIRLS OUT?
NO WAY!

953
01:30:35,667 --> 01:30:38,636
- I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
- I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.

954
01:30:38,704 --> 01:30:42,306
NOBODY'S LEAVING.
LET'S GET HIM TO A HOSPITAL.

955
01:30:42,373 --> 01:30:45,009
READY?
ONE, TWO, THREE.

956
01:30:45,077 --> 01:30:47,044
UP! UP!

957
01:30:47,112 --> 01:30:51,281
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
I GOT HIM.

958
01:30:51,349 --> 01:30:54,585
PUT YOUR WEIGHT ON ME.

01:31:00,692 --> 01:31:02,559
I'M HERE.

961
01:31:02,628 --> 01:31:04,561
GOLDIE,
ARE YOU THERE?
DAD, I'M HERE.

962
01:31:04,630 --> 01:31:07,197
DR. GOLDMAN,
I'VE GOT YOU.
DOWN THE STAIRS.

963
01:31:07,265 --> 01:31:10,701
EASY, YOU GUYS.
EVERYBODY
JUST SLOW DOWN.

964
01:31:10,769 --> 01:31:12,737
EASY.

965
01:31:12,804 --> 01:31:15,506
KEEP HIM STEADY, VIOLET.
KEEP HIM STEADY.

966
01:31:15,573 --> 01:31:18,308
<i>DAD,</i>

967
01:31:18,376 --> 01:31:20,444
IT'S OKAY.

968
01:31:47,372 --> 01:31:51,542
ALL RIGHT. WHOA!
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

969
01:31:51,609 --> 01:31:53,944
WATCH HIS HEAD.
I GOT HIM.

970
01:31:56,281 --> 01:31:58,883
ARE YOU IN?
OKAY, MOVE OVER.

971
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:02,619
I'M DRIVING.
I'M DRIVING.
WHERE'S LEGS?

972
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:05,522
SHUT IT.
WE'VE GOT
TO GO!
OKAY, GO!

973
01:32:06,992 --> 01:32:09,259
GO!

974
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:20,237
LEGS?

975
01:32:33,185 --> 01:32:35,319
LEGS?

976
01:33:04,582 --> 01:33:06,583
LEGS!

977
01:33:08,120 --> 01:33:10,121
LEGS!

978
01:33:13,558 --> 01:33:15,726
LEGS.

979
01:33:15,794 --> 01:33:17,828
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

980
01:33:17,896 --> 01:33:20,397
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO.

981
01:33:20,465 --> 01:33:22,933
STAY WITH US.

982
01:33:24,335 --> 01:33:26,937
WE'RE YOUR FAMILY.

983
01:33:28,940 --> 01:33:31,575
DO YOU WANT TO GO
WITH ME?

984
01:33:39,717 --> 01:33:43,420
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
I'M GONNA DO THIS, OKAY?

985
01:33:43,488 --> 01:33:46,390
AND WHEN A CAR STOPS,
YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT IT.

986
01:33:46,457 --> 01:33:48,993
YOU'LL JUST KNOW
AND YOU DECIDE.

987
01:33:51,629 --> 01:33:54,999
AND YOU JUST DO
WHAT FEELS RIGHT
IN YOUR HEART. OKAY?

988
01:34:46,651 --> 01:34:48,853
I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.

989
01:35:04,102 --> 01:35:06,703
YOU'RE IN MY HEART,
MADDY.

990
01:36:52,143 --> 01:36:54,878
GOLDIE'S DAD CLAIMED
HE SHOT HIMSELF.

991
01:36:54,946 --> 01:36:57,381
IT WAS JUST STUPID ENOUGH
THE POLICE BELIEVED IT.

992
01:36:57,449 --> 01:37:02,119
HE GOT GOLDIE INTO REHAB,
WORKED THINGS OUT WITH HER
EVENTUALLY.

993
01:37:04,122 --> 01:37:07,591
I'VE TRAVELED SINCE.
