1
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,916
My dad said that ever since I was young,
I've had a dream for myself.

2
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:09,041
Having grown up, I still believe
that I will become a shining superstar.

3
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,916
My dream has to come true.

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,125
Like destiny!

5
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:45,000
Teacher!

6
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,083
The exam is coming soon.

7
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,541
ELEMENTS OF MUSIC - DURATION

8
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:53,208
What's wrong with him?

9
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,333
However, while waiting for your destiny,

10
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:01,666
you still have to do other things...

11
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:12,833
You guys study on your own today,

12
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:16,041
under my supervision.

13
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,208
Today, we're gonna talk about "Shining."

14
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,958
So, how does one shine?

15
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,083
Your voice?

16
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:23,333
Your attitude?

17
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:24,791
Or your wardrobe?

18
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,583
Yes, but not enough.

19
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:31,500
We need a heart filled with enthusiasm,

20
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:32,583
and a pure soul.

21
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:36,291
We need to hold
the audience's attention with our eyes,

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and charm them with our singing.

23
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:53,458
Hey, Hoang.

24
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,791
Hey kid, slow down.

25
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:05,083
Tai, I said I'd meet you outside.

26
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,250
Hey. You out of your mind?

27
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:11,083
I can't get you in that show.

28
00:03:11,541 --> 00:03:13,583
They're all A-list singers.

29
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:16,208
Where will I put an F-lister like you?

30
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:20,125
Call me again in three years.
Such a nuisance.

31
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,958
She's so annoying.

32
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,833
-Tai.
-Yes?

33
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,375
Remember to get me the best slot.

34
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:27,875
Yeah, I got you.

35
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,541
This is all I have.

36
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,250
And you will get all that you want.

37
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:33,666
I like you.

38
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,166
I like talented kids
who need one big break.

39
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:40,416
I hate those freeloaders
without any actual talent.

40
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,458
Just saying.
No joke or offense whatsoever.

41
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:57,083
Tonight is gonna be your night.

42
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:00,333
There's one door in your way.

43
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,500
You need to step over it.

44
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,958
Please step over. I need to talk to you.

45
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:09,500
You're an excellent teacher

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,875
and there's a chance for you
to shine even more.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,208
Let me tell you something.

48
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:19,666
America is huge,

49
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,750
and their education system
is very developed.

50
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,166
Same with Japan.

51
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:26,458
Their infrastructure and education
are amazing.

52
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,458
And most importantly,
they need great teachers.

53
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,833
You mean... This is a surprise.

54
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,375
Right?

55
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,750
Can you see our beautiful
S-shaped country?

56
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,041
Look to the east of it.

57
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,833
Where the tiny dots are,

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,250
there's a special village
that needs a great teacher.

59
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,916
I think you are a great fit.

60
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,666
I'm exiled into wilderness?

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,291
There are people there.

62
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,458
It has a very fancy name.

63
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,750
Quy village.

64
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,416
But why me?

65
00:04:58,666 --> 00:04:59,750
I can read people.

66
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:02,208
You have an enthusiastic heart,
and a pure soul.

67
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,666
You will shine.

68
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:04,958
No.

69
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,208
Swift as the wind.

70
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,666
Hey, you changed your mind?

71
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,208
I don't care who you are.

72
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:05,375
You pay your debt now,

73
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,916
and I'll be out of your hair.

74
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,916
You talked so fast he couldn't translate.

75
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:20,500
Why harass me every day
for a few hundred millions?

76
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,833
Soon you can take your money back in bags.

77
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:25,875
I'll pay all the interest too.

78
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:32,583
Learn Vietnamese.

79
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:35,791
If you don't pay,

80
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,083
I'll kill you.

81
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,666
TRIALS MAY NOT FAIL

82
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:17,541
Some day you guys will be proud of me.

83
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,083
And that day is today.

84
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:53,208
Mr. Nguyen.

85
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,333
Excuse me, you are...?

86
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,416
I'm Hoang.

87
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:00,375
I sent you some of my songs.

88
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:01,416
Hi Mr. Nguyen.

89
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,875
Hey, Huyen My.

90
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:03,833
-How are you?
-Good.

91
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,125
You thought about it?

92
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,041
It's okay.

93
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,583
See you later.

94
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,083
This number is up next.

95
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,208
Open the doors.

96
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:19,083
On behalf of V Heartbeat V Live,

97
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,583
we would like to thank you for coming.

98
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:24,125
Hope to see you again soon.
Have a great evening!

99
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,166
Thank you all.

100
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,833
Please let me go. I'm a nice person.

101
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,583
People are slandering me.

102
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:02,958
I'm not a fraud.

103
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,750
Please let me go.

104
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,166
Please.

105
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,958
Please. I'm telling the truth.

106
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,750
I did it because I was possessed.

107
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,500
Please, please officers.

108
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,833
Please let me go.

109
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,291
Hoang! I'm so sorry.

110
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:20,791
I got tricked so I had to trick people.

111
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,583
A showrunner named Tai
was just arrested for fraud.

112
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,625
As manager of a well-known dance group
scheduled to perform at a hit show,

113
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:37,333
Tai took money from young singers
to take them backstage,

114
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,708
promising them a chance to perform.

115
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:42,916
The organizer is confirmed
to not be involved in such a scam.

116
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:50,250
As years pass by, I ask myself
"What have I got?"

117
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,833
As days pass I am left with
a reminder of what I am not

118
00:10:53,916 --> 00:10:55,833
How many more years do I get?

119
00:10:57,291 --> 00:11:00,875
As days pass I am left with
A reminder of what I am not

120
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:03,166
How many more years do I get?

121
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,416
How many more years do I get?

122
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:13,333
What's wrong?

123
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:16,375
I will be a famous singer.

124
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,958
Do what you want,
just don't quit teaching.

125
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,208
Because that was mom's last wish?

126
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,583
As years pass I ask myself
"What have I got?"

127
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:38,333
As days pass I am left with
A reminder of what I am not

128
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,250
I will always remember you.

129
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,791
TEACHER HOANG

130
00:12:24,416 --> 00:12:25,416
Hello?

131
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,416
Why are you calling me so late?

132
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:35,500
I believe this is the right decision.

133
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:55,583
LET'S SHINE

134
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,666
Scream out loud declaring I'm an ocean guy

135
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,458
Breath in the stench
Looking like a crazy man

136
00:13:55,708 --> 00:13:58,208
Meant to be, we meet where the oceans meet

137
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,958
Because you're a fish and I'm a shrimp

138
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,375
Trying to hold you
Gets me slapped in the face

139
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,666
Meant to be, we meet where the oceans meet

140
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,125
Because you're a fish and I'm a shrimp

141
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,666
Trying to hold you
Gets me slapped in the face

142
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:20,375
You're lucky today.

143
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:23,791
Usually, this road is covered by the sea.

144
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,666
It's opened up for you.

145
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,791
Normally you'd have to take the boat
and be throwing up from both ends.

146
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,583
Anyone here?

147
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,083
Anyone?

148
00:15:10,708 --> 00:15:11,708
Hey.

149
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:13,666
Is a school near here?

150
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Mr. Hoang.

151
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,125
I got it.

152
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,125
I got it.

153
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:40,625
Got it.

154
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,750
That's not the crab.

155
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,250
Sorry.

156
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:44,541
Is it pinching you?

157
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,875
It is...

158
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,375
Is it?

159
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,333
That's really rare.

160
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,250
The first time a crab grabs a...

161
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:54,833
A crab grabs a willy.

162
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,208
You mean, mean crab.

163
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,291
What has the willy done to you?

164
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:01,791
You're a vasectomy surgeon?

165
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,541
Here he is.

166
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:11,875
Where's the claw?

167
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,083
Still on your thing.

168
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:15,625
It will let go tonight.

169
00:16:16,416 --> 00:16:17,875
My name is Bung, the mayor.

170
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,583
Nickname is Weasel.

171
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,208
Let me take a pic for you.

172
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:29,500
Get photos right away.

173
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,458
It was my dad's. Very nice photos.

174
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:40,208
Let's try another one.

175
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,583
Damn, it's acting up again.

176
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:49,791
I'll fix it and take your photo later.

177
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:51,541
You're early.

178
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,208
Your boat wasn't ye lay.

179
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:55,583
Ye lay?

180
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:59,458
Like on a plane, you sometimes get ye lay.

181
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:03,875
Yeh, ye lay.

182
00:17:04,416 --> 00:17:07,458
It's so unexpected
we only have enough time for an I ven.

183
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,166
What's that?

184
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,333
I ven is like... bar ty.

185
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,625
Oh, event.

186
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,125
-Event.
-Yeah, I ven.

187
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:19,541
Your pronunciation is weird.

188
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,291
Teaching primary school,
but you still need your English for today.

189
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,458
LUV YA

190
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,000
That's some serious moves there!

191
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,750
Dance! Dance!

192
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,000
Take a picture.

193
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:52,791
Onion stuck in your teeth.

194
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,375
I'd like to say something.

195
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,500
Hello everyone.

196
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,250
After everything I've seen,

197
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,000
I think Quy Village
is not as boring as I thought.

198
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,083
And...

199
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:30,541
you guys even made a stage
for me to shine.

200
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:35,541
Today I'll sing you all a song.

201
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:39,000
He's singing.

202
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:43,416
Oh, my attention
Has just been caught into your eyes

203
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,791
The audio is murdering my ears.

204
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,250
Then it started in my heart a golden fire

205
00:18:48,791 --> 00:18:49,791
Fix the audio.

206
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,875
Act cool, but I was frozen for five secs

207
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:55,208
Does this doofus even know
how to control the mixer?

208
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,000
-What about these?
-These are not for volume.

209
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,166
Music on, dude!

210
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,041
GIVE ME A SHOULDER THAT I CAN LEAN ON

211
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:05,250
ENJOY YOUR HAPPY TIME.
SOMETHING TERRIBLE IS COMING.

212
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,000
I brought you water.

213
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:08,666
There's nothing to see. Can you leave?

214
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,708
Yep, nothing to see.

215
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,541
Get to know everything.

216
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,583
Here, life is not nearly
as fancy as the cities,

217
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,000
but it's very poor.

218
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,000
And in the class
you're lucky enough to teach,

219
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,583
there aren't a lot of kids,

220
00:21:28,125 --> 00:21:29,875
but it's kinda empty.

221
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:31,541
Easier for you.

222
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,041
Also,

223
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,166
fresh water is very rare.

224
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:37,625
Very, very rare.

225
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,250
Luckily, there's the ocean.

226
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,000
All the salt water you need.

227
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,833
The kids here are amazing.

228
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:44,708
Cute and very civilized.

229
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,375
I'll introduce you sometime.

230
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,458
-Crap.
-Boohoo.

231
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:49,708
Hey, you evil kids!

232
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,458
Not everyone gets this treatment.

233
00:21:55,541 --> 00:21:56,708
Only the people they like.

234
00:21:56,791 --> 00:21:57,958
Hey, stop.

235
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,250
-Stop.
-Hey!

236
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,125
Think you're faster than me?

237
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,791
The little one is Cu.

238
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,833
The bigger one is Tinh, his dad.

239
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:08,041
They're the cutest ones.

240
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,791
Come here every morning to play chase.

241
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,041
Don't mind them.

242
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,000
Know what I'm most proud of
in this village?

243
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:16,708
The ladies.

244
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:18,583
They're so beautiful.

245
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,458
All the best qualities.

246
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,625
Plus, very gentle and sweet.

247
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,583
So cute.

248
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,375
Aren't you taking me to the school?

249
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,833
That's the school.

250
00:22:42,791 --> 00:22:44,125
This is where I teach?

251
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,875
You wanna teach at the hospital?

252
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,666
And I live there?

253
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:50,833
Well, not me.

254
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,500
School's open.

255
00:23:03,375 --> 00:23:04,958
Why didn't you get a Lion Dance team?

256
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,250
Oh yeah, I forgot.

257
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,166
After you.

258
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:19,208
Ooh, you guys dressed up.

259
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,250
This class has
more kids than the last one.

260
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,500
Only one class.

261
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,291
Ranging from Grade One to Five.

262
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:31,875
Kids, the ceremony.

263
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,708
DEARLY DEPARTED

264
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:45,250
A moment of remembrance.

265
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,250
Welcome here, teacher

266
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:03,666
We're very delighted

267
00:24:04,083 --> 00:24:07,291
Our school is beautiful

268
00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,666
Mr. Bung.

269
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,125
The teachers before me...

270
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,083
-they all died?
-Nonsense.

271
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,833
Who said they die?

272
00:24:15,208 --> 00:24:18,041
I made up the song for the kids to sing,

273
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,166
so they remember
the teachers that were here.

274
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:23,333
Don't worry, you'll be there one day.

275
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,416
I almost forgot.

276
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:25,833
Let's take a pic of you.

277
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,833
Portrait.

278
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,875
Okay. The chorus.

279
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,625
The waves are singing a song

280
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,000
Are you blind?

281
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,250
That's the new teacher.

282
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:48,000
Couldn't you even say hello?

283
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:00,458
Do you want another pic?

284
00:25:01,083 --> 00:25:02,250
It was blurry again.

285
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,541
What time are you coming in tomorrow?
I'll let the kids know.

286
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:12,625
Here's the previous class schedule.

287
00:25:13,291 --> 00:25:14,833
Monday morning:

288
00:25:14,916 --> 00:25:15,833

291
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,166

But if you're free you can teach them.

296
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,541
The view is very nice here.

297
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,750
We should go home, the crows are here.

298
00:27:13,208 --> 00:27:18,541
Good morning teacher.

299
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:20,250
Can't you do it better?

300
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:21,625
Again.

301
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:25,333
Good morning teacher.

302
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:28,208
Good morning teacher.

303
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:36,083
HOANG

304
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:37,500
Name?

305
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:39,583
-You go first.
-He asked you, fatty.

306
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,083
He asked your name.

307
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,375
Fine, there's lots of seafood here.

308
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:48,041
And I really like seafood.

309
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,291
You know that?

310
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:54,958
You're Snail, you're the monitor.

311
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:56,208
Yes, sir.

312
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:59,291
Shrimp, you're the study deputy.

313
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,291
OK.

314
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:02,416
But he's so stupid sir.

315
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,666
And has terrible hygiene.

316
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,500
Let me be that.

317
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:06,708
You're greedy.

318
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,875
You're dirty.

319
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:10,458
Never brushing your teeth.

320
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:12,291
You don't brush your teeth?

321
00:28:12,875 --> 00:28:14,416
Shrimp, you'll be cleaning deputy.

322
00:28:16,916 --> 00:28:19,916
MY TEACHER HOANG

323
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,750
-You're Clam.
-Yes, sir.

324
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:24,583
You're the discipline deputy.

325
00:28:24,708 --> 00:28:26,458
But she cries a lot.

326
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,250
Scallop,

327
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,583
you're the art deputy.

328
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,875
-Yay!
-Couldn't be more wrong.

329
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:37,875
He can't do that, let me.

330
00:28:38,291 --> 00:28:39,208
Listen to me.

331
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,500
From now on, when you come to class,

332
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,625
you have to brush your teeth,
wash your face,

333
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:46,291
clip and clean your nails.

334
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:49,791
And clean and iron your clothes.

335
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:56,291
What?

336
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:59,125
Teacher, the art deputy pooped his pants.

337
00:29:00,666 --> 00:29:01,916
So stinky.

338
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,625
Unbelievable.

339
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:06,416
I'm so sorry.

340
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:10,833
Stop.

341
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:15,041
Stop.

342
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,250
Cry.

343
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,416
She was a breech baby.

344
00:29:24,875 --> 00:29:26,250
Next time if you're late,

345
00:29:26,541 --> 00:29:27,833
don't bother coming in.

346
00:29:28,708 --> 00:29:30,291
What's wrong with your foot?

347
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,958
Stepped on his shit bomb.

348
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,708
Knock it off. The teacher's mad.
Let's go.

349
00:29:37,666 --> 00:29:38,791
What are you doing?

350
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,416
I'm... cleaning up.

351
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:43,000
Why didn't you draw the water?

352
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:46,666
I dropped the bucket,
so I had to jump down.

353
00:29:47,125 --> 00:29:49,708
You went too far, Scallop.

354
00:29:51,666 --> 00:29:52,708
Hey!

355
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:54,208
Why'd you scrub here?

356
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:57,750
Stop.

357
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:00,208
Cry.

358
00:30:03,125 --> 00:30:04,708
I have to get out of here.

359
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,791
We've practiced this many times.

360
00:30:07,291 --> 00:30:08,333
Today's the day.

361
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:11,041
Let's keep Teacher Hoang here,
whatever it takes.

362
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,708
-Ms. Tu.
-Present.

363
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:15,000
Today you're the rain master.

364
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:16,666
You're in charge of it. Go.

365
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,500
Teo.

366
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,625
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

367
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,000
The audio is okay, waiting for command.

368
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:25,791
-The content?
-Here.

369
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,875
I stayed up all night for this.

370
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Good.

371
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:30,875
When I wave the hat,

372
00:30:31,083 --> 00:30:32,666
-you start right away.
-Okay.

373
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,583
-Make it believable.
-Okay.

374
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,708
Try your best.

375
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,041
You'll get 2 kgs of longans.

376
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:38,500
Now give me one.

377
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,208
-Okay. Go.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,875
Hold on to your chickens and ducks.

379
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,250
Don't fight, okay?

380
00:30:46,583 --> 00:30:47,416
Hey.

381
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,416
It's showtime, everybody move!

382
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,833
Let's go.

383
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,583
Teacher, where are you going?

384
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,958
Anywhere.

385
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,166
Anywhere but here.

386
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:01,833
Please don't mind Scallop.
He has an unhealthy gut.

387
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,458
I'll pick up after him.

388
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,000
There's no future in this village.

389
00:31:07,375 --> 00:31:09,333
You can't go. A storm is coming.

390
00:31:09,416 --> 00:31:10,375
I don't care.

391
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:11,583
You can't do that.

392
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:14,458
If you get on a boat,
the storm will sink everything.

393
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:15,875
The storm is here.

394
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:23,041
This is the weather forecast for today,
tomorrow, and all the days to come.

395
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:26,250
A storm is coming to our village.

396
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:29,958
There's rain somewhere
but we're not sure where.

397
00:31:30,166 --> 00:31:32,458
Anywhere with the rain would know.

398
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:39,791
The sky looks clear,
but if you move it will rain.

399
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:43,375
You see?

400
00:31:44,208 --> 00:31:45,250
It's weird here.

401
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:48,458
A storm comes even when it's sunny.

402
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,583
It's a thing.

403
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:54,625
Every time a storm comes,
the villagers have to go underground.

404
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,083
It's tough.

405
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:00,291
We have to take the animals too.

406
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,666
The winds are so strong
they could take houses.

407
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:05,125
You can't leave.

408
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,375
Gotta wait the storm out.

409
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,125
Understand? See how sad that is?

410
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,500
Get underground, quickly.

411
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:13,958
Look scared. Go down.

412
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:17,208
You see? Go underground!

413
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:19,625
Shit, he even fell.

414
00:32:19,708 --> 00:32:23,125
Okay go, look scared. Expression.

415
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,916
Mr. Bung, Mr. Tu fell on my chicken.

416
00:32:27,166 --> 00:32:29,083
This is not worth it.

417
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,875
Poor me!

418
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,875
The storm causes sustained wind.

419
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:47,041
Broken speaker.

420
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,000
It's storming everywhere.

421
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,291
It's hard to breathe.

422
00:32:57,958 --> 00:32:59,041
What are you doing?

423
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,458
Watching a movie?

424
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:02,125
Leave, now.

425
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,625
So we can't know where it is.

426
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:15,375
There go my longans.

427
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:18,333
Why are you hiding there?

428
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,500
He caught us. Leave.

429
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:21,833
Go, go.

430
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,083
Ha, you can act now?

431
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,291
You think I'm a child?

432
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:30,666
Huh?

433
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,208
Show's over.

434
00:33:35,208 --> 00:33:37,083
Boats are not allowed to leave shore.

435
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:48,625
Teacher.

436
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:50,666
Teacher.

437
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,625
Teacher.

438
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:54,125
Teacher.

439
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,291
Wait.

440
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,000
What?

441
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,333
Mr. Bung!

442
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:06,708
Are we done?
Let me down, it's hot up here.

443
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,916
Come down.

444
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,958
You're overacting for a buck.

445
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,166
You bastard!

446
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:20,250
Help!

447
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:24,750
Help me!

448
00:35:29,125 --> 00:35:32,291
Crazy dude. Steal my bottle boat
to cross the ocean?

449
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:58,833
Who's up there?

450
00:36:05,208 --> 00:36:07,625
I'm Sam. I'm kind of a gofer around here.

451
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,041
Don't you shower?

452
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,166
You smell like dried squid.

453
00:36:12,125 --> 00:36:14,458
The mayor told me to come fix your roof.

454
00:36:15,416 --> 00:36:17,166
That Weasel,

455
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:18,875
I'll beat him up.

456
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,333
Hey!

457
00:36:21,125 --> 00:36:23,208
-Are you crazy?
-I dare you to hit my dad.

458
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,125
What? Weasel is dried squid's dad?

459
00:36:28,416 --> 00:36:29,291
Hey!

460
00:36:31,583 --> 00:36:32,750
Who changed my clothes?

461
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,208
You were soaking wet,
who's to blame if you're dead?

462
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:38,000
Did you do it?

463
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:40,333
My dad.

464
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:46,875
Oh, he said you seem tall but...

465
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,791
Never mind, I don't want you to feel bad.

466
00:37:03,583 --> 00:37:05,291
HAPPY RELAXING
FROM A PRETTY GIRL

467
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,833
Thanks.

468
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,375
What does a gofer do?

469
00:37:28,583 --> 00:37:29,916
Everything.

470
00:37:30,208 --> 00:37:33,000
Houses, electricity, bikes, boats.

471
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:35,041
Why don't you fix your attitude?

472
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:42,041
Hey! Just like a dude.

473
00:37:47,166 --> 00:37:48,166
Shrimp.

474
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,250
Listen to me.

475
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:51,833
You have eight apples.

476
00:37:52,875 --> 00:37:54,041
I took five from you.

477
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:56,041
How many do you have?

478
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:58,583
Five.

479
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,000
Five, sir.

480
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:06,583
Count again.

481
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,583
One. Two. Three.

482
00:38:09,666 --> 00:38:12,833
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

483
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,708
Taking away five,
how many do you have left?

484
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:18,708
One. Two. Three.

485
00:38:19,166 --> 00:38:21,041
So what's eight minus five?

486
00:38:24,416 --> 00:38:25,500
Uh... five, sir.

487
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,416
Focus.

488
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:30,250
Taking away five, we have?

489
00:38:30,333 --> 00:38:32,375
One. Two. Three.

490
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:35,708
Okay, so what's eight minus five?

491
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,041
Hmm...

492
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,708
Not five.

493
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,333
Good, not five.

494
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,416
How many then?

495
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,333
Ah... It's okay.

496
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:53,375
I'm sorry.

497
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:55,375
Shrimp.

498
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,000
You didn't brush your teeth, did you?

499
00:38:58,291 --> 00:38:59,375
They're my teeth, sir.

500
00:38:59,458 --> 00:39:01,375
It is my business to brush them or not.

501
00:39:01,458 --> 00:39:02,458
It concerns no other.

502
00:39:02,583 --> 00:39:03,666
No other?

503
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,250
Hold out your hands.

504
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:07,125
Breathe out.

505
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,333
Stronger.

506
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,375
Palm your nose.

507
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,333
Concerned now?

508
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,208
Hey, don't you greet your teacher?

509
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,375
Name?

510
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,083
Cu.

511
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,000
Hey, hey.

512
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:28,750
I asked your name.

513
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,166
Cu.

514
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,541
His name is Cu.

515
00:39:33,833 --> 00:39:35,583
If you're late again,

516
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,833
don't bother coming in.

517
00:39:42,833 --> 00:39:43,875
I didn't yell at you.

518
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,375
Scallop, why are you so persistent?

519
00:39:53,333 --> 00:39:54,708
I went too far.

520
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,333
Class is over.

521
00:39:58,916 --> 00:39:59,791
Teacher.

522
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:01,041
It's not time yet.

523
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:03,875
The other teachers let us play soccer.

524
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:14,375
Soccer is over.

525
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:17,458
Let me go get that.

526
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:29,125
Would he leave again?

527
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,875
He doesn't like dirty and stupid people.

528
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:36,416
Scallop, it's your fault
the teacher doesn't like us.

529
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,333
Just poop all the poop at home.

530
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:41,333
I'm sick.

531
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:44,208
He will leave like everyone else anyway.

532
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:46,875
It's so poor here, not like the city.

533
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,041
How was school?

534
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,666
Good!

535
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:53,833
But the teacher doesn't like us.

536
00:40:54,083 --> 00:40:56,625
That's not true. You're just naughty kids.

537
00:40:56,708 --> 00:40:58,750
Try to study properly and he'll like you.

538
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,791
-Cu, bring food to the teacher.
-Yes.

539
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:04,500
I'll teach you English on the way.

540
00:41:04,583 --> 00:41:05,791
Con meo is "the cat."

541
00:41:05,875 --> 00:41:07,250
Con ga is "the chicken."

542
00:41:07,458 --> 00:41:10,333
-What about con trau?
-Uh... I'm not sure.

543
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,208
Music Talent Show - Let's Shine
Deadline August 12th

544
00:41:23,541 --> 00:41:25,125
AUGUST 12TH

545
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,583
Boss, the designer
has sent the stage plot.

546
00:41:43,791 --> 00:41:46,041
We need something original.
Start from scratch.

547
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:47,875
Yes, boss.

548
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:51,708
Beautiful sun and clear blue sky

549
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,458
The wind brings a nice scent

550
00:41:56,291 --> 00:41:59,750
The waves sing a lullaby

551
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:03,125
Oh ah oh ah oh ah

552
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,541
The sun's come out
Let's have fun and not worry

553
00:42:10,625 --> 00:42:12,416
Life is not...

554
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:15,458
Anything else?

555
00:42:20,041 --> 00:42:23,833
The sun's come out
Let's have fun and not worry

556
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,208
Let's live in the moment

557
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,875
Sailing downwind.
Don't give in to hardship

558
00:42:31,166 --> 00:42:33,875
Keep sailing through rough waves

559
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,125
Crap.

560
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:06,416
Hey.

561
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:33,625
Cu, where are you?

562
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,375
I'm here, dad.

563
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,708
Where's my liquor?

564
00:43:41,583 --> 00:43:43,958
I just got it, dad.

565
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,583
Good.

566
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:07,583
Here you go.

567
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:11,708
Good.

568
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:37,583
Cu.

569
00:44:40,375 --> 00:44:41,583
Where did you get this?

570
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:45,708
Delicious.

571
00:44:46,625 --> 00:44:50,041
Salty like salt and spicy like chili.

572
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:51,791
Just like your old man's life.

573
00:44:57,791 --> 00:44:58,791
It's hot.

574
00:44:59,958 --> 00:45:00,875
Fiery hot.

575
00:45:03,375 --> 00:45:05,125
FOR MY DEAREST SON

576
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:21,750
You play?

577
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,666
Dear Producers of Let's Shine,

578
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,333
I'm Do Duc Hoang.

579
00:45:39,166 --> 00:45:42,416
My dream is to shine on a music stage.

580
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:46,416
Today I'll sing an original song
that I wrote, called

581
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,791
The Fishing Song.

582
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:55,625
Beautiful sun and clear blue sky

583
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,291
The wind brings a nice scent

584
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:05,166
The waves sing a lullaby

585
00:46:05,625 --> 00:46:09,041
Oh ah oh ah oh ah

586
00:46:15,416 --> 00:46:17,125
How can I send this without service?

587
00:46:17,916 --> 00:46:19,500
No clue how people live here.

588
00:46:22,875 --> 00:46:24,041
Hoang.

589
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,000
-Let's go.
-Where?

590
00:46:27,083 --> 00:46:28,375
Na is in labor.

591
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:31,083
-Na who?
-Mrs. Bay's daughter.

592
00:46:31,166 --> 00:46:32,500
I know nothing about delivery.

593
00:46:32,583 --> 00:46:33,708
Are you from the city?

594
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,750
-So what?
-City people know everything.

595
00:46:36,083 --> 00:46:38,291
Cu, stop buying wine for your dad.

596
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:39,500
Use it to take a girl out.

597
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:40,666
Let's go.

598
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,250
Hurry up, teacher.

599
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,791
Someone is in labor
and you're taking a selfie.

600
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:47,916
Are you crazy?

601
00:46:48,416 --> 00:46:50,500
There's no waves around here?

602
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:53,250
You're crazy? You're asking
if there's waves near the ocean?

603
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,041
There are sea waves everywhere.

604
00:46:55,333 --> 00:46:56,833
I'm talking about phone service.

605
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,250
Oh, that?

606
00:46:58,333 --> 00:46:59,833
Talk to Sam.

607
00:47:01,125 --> 00:47:02,666
She's the only one who knows.

608
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,458
Who's this Na then?

609
00:47:04,541 --> 00:47:05,625
The prettiest lady here,

610
00:47:05,708 --> 00:47:07,041
so she keeps getting pregnant.

611
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,583
You'll see.

612
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:19,875
-That's Na?
-Isn't she pretty?

613
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,208
Of the two cows, this one is prettier.

614
00:47:22,583 --> 00:47:23,916
I don't know how to deliver a calf.

615
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,166
Nothing is impossible. Get in.

616
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:38,041
No one here knows how to do it?

617
00:47:38,166 --> 00:47:39,500
Yes, Cross-eyed Six.

618
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,458
But he's in the hospital.

619
00:47:41,541 --> 00:47:42,375
Why?

620
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:44,625
He went to help a cow last week.

621
00:47:45,291 --> 00:47:47,750
Accidentally walked in on a sick bull.

622
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,958
Got kicked, hospitalized, still there.

623
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:59,000
When you see the calf's legs,

624
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:00,958
you tie this around them,

625
00:48:01,041 --> 00:48:03,041
then slowly pull it out. Okay?

626
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:06,125
Usually before you see the legs--

627
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,208
The water breaks.

628
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:19,500
Come on Hoang!

629
00:48:26,083 --> 00:48:27,125
Such a beauty.

630
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,500
One more.

631
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,250
Hey, can we name your kid Hoang?

632
00:48:48,291 --> 00:48:49,125
Hey.

633
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,375
Did you know how to do that?

634
00:48:51,541 --> 00:48:53,083
I'm the mayor, I know everything.

635
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,416
Why did you make me do it?

636
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:58,166
You gotta learn.

637
00:48:58,583 --> 00:48:59,458
What if I weren't here?

638
00:49:00,541 --> 00:49:02,000
Can't rely on the mayor forever.

639
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:04,541
Thank you.

640
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,916
I'll teach you to deliver pigs
when we have time.

641
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,625
Much more fun.

642
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,083
Let's go eat.

643
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:18,250
There used to be
all kinds of services here.

644
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,791
Good ones too.

645
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:21,541
But after a few storms,

646
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,208
the cables went down.

647
00:49:24,666 --> 00:49:26,083
Everything is broken.

648
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,083
Quy Village is very rich in sea resources.

649
00:49:30,166 --> 00:49:31,583
Lots of seafood.

650
00:49:31,791 --> 00:49:35,250
However, being so far from the mainland,
we face a lot of difficulties.

651
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,666
I'm not a tourist.

652
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,875
But you gotta know to teach the kids.

653
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:42,916
I don't teach. I'll be a famous singer.

654
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:52,166
Seems like no one here knows how to talk.

655
00:50:01,208 --> 00:50:02,083
It's so sunny.

656
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,250
Yeah, clothes dry really fast here.

657
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,125
Where are you taking me?

658
00:50:13,291 --> 00:50:15,166
The only place you can get service.

659
00:50:15,541 --> 00:50:16,375
Very pretty.

660
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:17,791
It's called

661
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:19,083
The...

662
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,291
Very...

663
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:21,250
Far...

664
00:50:21,458 --> 00:50:22,375
Away...

665
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:24,333
Place.

666
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,291
Still can't talk.

667
00:50:28,166 --> 00:50:31,750
Don't think you're better than everyone.
People here call me Princess.

668
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,625
Princess?

669
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:37,541
Fine, why is there no Prince Charming
for our Dried Squid Princess?

670
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:40,916
'Cos I'm waiting for a prince
on a ship with scarlet sails.

671
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,750
People call this place the Wind Hill.

672
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:52,166
It's beautiful.

673
00:50:57,416 --> 00:50:59,833
My dad is trying to keep you here.

674
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,416
But...

675
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:03,041
how could he?

676
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,333
Since your heart doesn't belong here.

677
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,375
This place needs a teacher so badly

678
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:18,291
that my dad always thinks his son-in-law
has to be a teacher.

679
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,625
Why can't I get service?

680
00:51:24,083 --> 00:51:25,000
I lied.

681
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,000
Gotta go to the mainland.

682
00:51:29,083 --> 00:51:31,125
What are you looking at? I saw your clip.

683
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:34,791
You won't get picked.

684
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:36,208
It's so boring.

685
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,666
So bad.

686
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:39,833
You...

687
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,875
-I what?
-Dried Squid.

688
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:50,708
Hello, teacher.

689
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,166
Where are you going so early?

690
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,250
I'm... going for a walk.

691
00:51:59,208 --> 00:52:00,041
Ah, this.

692
00:52:00,833 --> 00:52:03,666
I want to go to the mainland
for phone service.

693
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:05,291
So I can send an email.

694
00:52:06,875 --> 00:52:07,791
I know.

695
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,125
You want to leave, don't you?

696
00:52:12,083 --> 00:52:14,000
But I really want to learn.

697
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,583
This one is broken.

698
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:23,000
It doesn't work.

699
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,916
I'm not lying.

700
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,416
-Who's that?
-It's Cu.

701
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,750
He has a beautiful voice.

702
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:46,375
His mom was a singer.

703
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:58,208
Beautiful sun and clear blue sky

704
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:02,875
The wind brings a nice scent

705
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,208
I saw your clip.

706
00:53:05,791 --> 00:53:07,750
It won't get picked.

707
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:10,333
So boring.

708
00:53:16,958 --> 00:53:18,583
Looks like I gotta use the kids.

709
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:23,000
Today, we're not studying.

710
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:25,083
Just learning to sing. Agreed?

711
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,291
Yes sir.

712
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:30,291
I'll also make a movie about our island.

713
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,791
-You guys with me?
-Yes sir.

714
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:36,458
He's late again.

715
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,291
He has to take care of his dad.

716
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:41,208
Worried you'd kick him out,
he asked me for help.

717
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:44,000
It's okay, come in.

718
00:53:50,208 --> 00:53:52,250
First of all, I want to hear you sing.

719
00:53:52,541 --> 00:53:53,791
Let me go first.

720
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,500
Any song is fine.

721
00:53:58,458 --> 00:53:59,625
Cool.

722
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:01,583
-Starting with Snail.
-Yes.

723
00:54:02,041 --> 00:54:03,666
Hang on, I'm picking a song.

724
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,375
Oh, I got it.

725
00:54:08,125 --> 00:54:11,125
There was once this little birdie

726
00:54:11,583 --> 00:54:14,166
-Looking so...
-Definitely the work of Bung.

727
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:18,916
Whenever you're writing on the board
Chalk dust falls on you

728
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,958
Okay, good.

729
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,916
Yesterday, when I went to school

730
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:28,416
Mommy was holding my hands

731
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:33,791
My tiny school lies in the grapevine
My tiny teacher teaches me to sing

732
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:37,416
That's nonsense,

733
00:54:38,083 --> 00:54:38,916
don't do that.

734
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,458
To be a good singer we need two things.

735
00:54:41,541 --> 00:54:43,666
That's feeling and technique.

736
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,416
Feeling brings soul to your voice.

737
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,875
SOUL - FEELING - TECHNIQUE

738
00:54:46,958 --> 00:54:48,416
It's hard...

739
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,250
to practice feeling.

740
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:53,333
But we can practice the technique.

741
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,750
Follow my lead.

742
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,125
Mi

743
00:54:58,208 --> 00:55:01,083
Mi

744
00:55:01,583 --> 00:55:03,791
Mi

745
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,291
Mi

746
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:07,625
Cu.

747
00:55:08,416 --> 00:55:09,666
Why are you not singing?

748
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:11,958
Your beats are off.

749
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,375
Stand up.

750
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:26,583
You wanna talk beats with me?

751
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:30,125
Follow my lead.

752
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,625
Amazing!

753
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:03,291
Amazeballs!

754
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:12,666
Everyone ready? Camera rolling.

755
00:56:14,166 --> 00:56:15,291
Action.

756
00:56:16,541 --> 00:56:20,041
Beautiful sun and clear blue sky

757
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:24,250
The wind brings a nice scent

758
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,416
The waves sing a lullaby

759
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,958
Oh ah oh ah oh ah

760
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:35,875
The sun's come out, let's have fun
And not worry

761
00:56:36,458 --> 00:56:39,250
Let's live in the moment

762
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:43,750
Sailing downwind
Don't give in to hardship

763
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:47,708
Keep sailing through rough waves

764
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:51,166
Come on, let's go fishing

765
00:56:52,083 --> 00:56:55,625
Our village sings through day and night

766
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:59,291
Come on, let's reach our dreams

767
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:02,458
They are out there waiting

768
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:04,208
They are out there waiting

769
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:05,416
Come on, let's go fish...

770
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,708
Hang on.

771
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:08,416
Go. Run.

772
00:57:10,458 --> 00:57:11,416
Is it out yet?

773
00:57:11,916 --> 00:57:14,000
Gotta wait for the singer to poop.

774
00:57:14,250 --> 00:57:15,166
Lunch time.

775
00:57:15,708 --> 00:57:19,000
Come on, let's go fishing

776
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:23,416
Our village sings through day and night

777
00:57:23,708 --> 00:57:27,083
Come on, let's reach our dreams

778
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:29,166
They are out there waiting

779
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,791
Stop, stop.

780
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:33,833
Did someone steal from you guys?

781
00:57:33,916 --> 00:57:35,166
Are you going to a funeral?

782
00:57:35,416 --> 00:57:36,250
Again.

783
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:38,875
Slow down so it's smoother.

784
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:40,958
Stop jerking back and forth.

785
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,708
I haven't eaten yet, dad.

786
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,000
Come on, come on.

787
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:47,125
Come on, let's go fishing

788
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:48,750
Stop, stop.

789
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:52,291
I told you to be happy, not crazy.

790
00:57:53,541 --> 00:57:56,416
Be happy on the inside, understand? Again.

791
00:57:57,083 --> 00:57:59,416
You're so weak, it keeps jerking.

792
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,958
You should eat less.

793
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,250
Come on, let's go fishing

794
00:58:05,041 --> 00:58:06,375
Our village sings through...

795
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:07,541
Stop, stop.

796
00:58:07,791 --> 00:58:09,041
Let me down.

797
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:10,625
-What you doing here?
-Watching.

798
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:13,416
-You're in frame.
-Good.

799
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:15,250
How is it good!

800
00:58:19,625 --> 00:58:20,625
My phone.

801
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,625
I wouldn't throw mine.

802
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,500
But the video...

803
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:26,791
Gotta start from scratch.
We're experienced now.

804
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:28,416
Lunch time.

805
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:32,166
There's no good angle here.

806
00:58:32,916 --> 00:58:34,000
Hey.

807
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:36,625
Why are we shooting this at night?

808
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:41,500
Because seeing a teacher
teaching in a deserted place at night

809
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,750
will get more sympathy.

810
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,666
The power's out.

811
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:48,666
Then it's even more sympathetic.

812
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:51,000
A teacher teaching in a deserted place,

813
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,250
still teaching at night, without power.

814
00:58:53,625 --> 00:58:54,833
But the power's out.

815
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:56,291
We can't shoot in the dark.

816
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,083
Can we use candles?

817
00:58:58,416 --> 00:58:59,875
Nah, too cliché.

818
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,208
How about incense?

819
00:59:01,291 --> 00:59:04,750
We get a bundle here and there,
there's light and smoke.

820
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,500
You're making no sense.

821
00:59:07,125 --> 00:59:08,833
-I have an idea.
-What?

822
00:59:10,375 --> 00:59:14,666
Firefly, firefly

823
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:19,291
Up the belly you light

824
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,625
Every summer night

825
00:59:23,708 --> 00:59:28,166
Come out and play

826
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:32,541
From the bushes

827
00:59:32,791 --> 00:59:37,125
To the sides of the ponds

828
00:59:37,458 --> 00:59:42,083
From the high branches

829
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:46,833
To the grass down below

830
00:59:52,666 --> 00:59:55,916
Come on, let's go fishing

831
00:59:56,625 --> 01:00:00,083
Our village sings through day and night

832
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:04,000
Come on, let's reach our dreams

833
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:08,625
They are out there waiting

834
01:00:08,958 --> 01:00:12,833
Come on, come on, let's pull up the net!

835
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,750
Come on, come on, let's pull up the net!

836
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:20,833
Come on, come on, let's pull up the net!

837
01:00:21,083 --> 01:00:24,500
Come on, come on, let's pull up the net!

838
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:28,708
The sun's come out
Let's have fun and not worry

839
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,791
Let's live in the moment

840
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,708
Sailing downwind
Don't give in to hardship

841
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:40,083
Keep sailing through rough waves

842
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:52,125
Come on, let's reach our dreams

843
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:56,416
They are out there waiting

844
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:59,875
Come on, let's go fishing

845
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,458
Our village sings through

846
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:04,041
Day and night

847
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:07,250
Come on, let's reach our dreams

848
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,958
They are out there waiting

849
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,041
They are out there waiting

850
01:01:13,708 --> 01:01:15,833
The boats sailing

851
01:01:15,916 --> 01:01:19,750
Towards the sun

852
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,083
People diving

853
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:28,500
Into the sea

854
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:30,416
There's the fish

855
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,166
Come on

856
01:01:32,250 --> 01:01:34,000
Let's go fishing

857
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:37,958
Our village sings through day and night

858
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,833
Come on, let's reach our dreams

859
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,041
They are waiting

860
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:44,958
Out there

861
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:46,041
They're out there

862
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:49,583
Come on, let's go fishing

863
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:53,541
Our village sings through day and night

864
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,625
Come on, let's reach

865
01:01:56,708 --> 01:01:57,958
Our dreams

866
01:01:58,666 --> 01:02:00,708
They are out there waiting

867
01:02:00,791 --> 01:02:02,333
They are out there waiting

868
01:02:03,041 --> 01:02:06,666
Come on, come on, let's pull up the net!

869
01:02:06,833 --> 01:02:10,375
Come on, come on, let's pull up the net!

870
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:14,208
Come on, come on, let's pull up the net!

871
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,625
Come on, come on

872
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,666
Let's pull up the net!

873
01:02:19,291 --> 01:02:20,875
Come on!

874
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:27,500
That's good.

875
01:02:29,208 --> 01:02:32,541
This contestant's phone
is always out of reach.

876
01:02:33,041 --> 01:02:34,000
Address?

877
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,625
We have it, but very far.

878
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:37,458
Overseas?

879
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:38,750
No, in Vietnam.

880
01:02:39,291 --> 01:02:40,541
Then it's not far.

881
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,416
We have enough good videos.

882
01:02:45,666 --> 01:02:46,666
Let's continue.

883
01:02:58,791 --> 01:02:59,791
I sent it.

884
01:03:02,458 --> 01:03:03,875
I think a storm is coming.

885
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,041
Congratulations!

886
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:12,208
I think you'll get picked.

887
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,333
You don't seem very happy.

888
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:24,500
There will be other teachers for the kids.

889
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,875
There's nothing here
that can change your mind, right?

890
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,958
Shrimp quit school.

891
01:03:41,583 --> 01:03:44,000
His parents made him go fishing.

892
01:03:45,708 --> 01:03:46,833
Cu as well.

893
01:03:48,666 --> 01:03:50,000
But they are just kids.

894
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,041
They have to study.

895
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:54,291
That's how it is here.

896
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:08,666
All done.

897
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:12,208
Hello teacher.

898
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,083
Hello everyone.

899
01:04:15,458 --> 01:04:16,791
I'm Hoang.

900
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,458
He's gonna stay home from now on.

901
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:21,125
He did so badly in class.

902
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,458
Other teachers kept sending him home.

903
01:04:23,541 --> 01:04:25,875
Boys in this village will go on boats

904
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:28,333
or work in this ice factory
when they're grown up.

905
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,791
But you have to know basic math
to do business.

906
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,708
Math?

907
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,250
Shrimp, tell me.

908
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,083
I give you 70,000 Dong.

909
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,166
I take 20,000 back. How much do you have?

910
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,416
50,000.

911
01:04:44,083 --> 01:04:45,291
Good.

912
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:46,666
You see?

913
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,875
Okay, maybe she gave him an easy one.

914
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,541
Tell me. I give you 120,000 Dong.

915
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:54,833
I take 62,000. How much do you have left?

916
01:04:55,125 --> 01:04:56,416
58,000.

917
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:58,541
See?

918
01:04:58,833 --> 01:05:01,000
That's good enough. No need to study.

919
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:01,916
Yeah.

920
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:03,833
But...

921
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,875
Shrimp doesn't like this job.

922
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:08,958
He has passion and talent
for something else.

923
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:11,083
Shrimp.

924
01:05:11,666 --> 01:05:14,333
-What do you want to do?
-I want to become Messi.

925
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:16,416
Messi?

926
01:05:16,625 --> 01:05:17,500
Who's that?

927
01:05:17,583 --> 01:05:20,291
-Is he an actor?
-No, a soccer player.

928
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,708
Gosh! You're too skinny.

929
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:27,458
Look at your legs.
They look like chopsticks.

930
01:05:27,541 --> 01:05:30,333
You need legs like me
to be a soccer player.

931
01:05:31,416 --> 01:05:33,583
Okay, try with that ball.

932
01:05:46,541 --> 01:05:47,750
Wow!

933
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:50,416
It's the wind.

934
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:52,458
He got lucky.

935
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,750
What if someone held you back
from your dreams?

936
01:05:58,208 --> 01:05:59,291
How would you feel?

937
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,500
He'd better have an education.

938
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:05,416
Let him go to school.

939
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:11,291
Come to class tomorrow.

940
01:06:28,125 --> 01:06:29,166
Hello teacher.

941
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,583
Let him go to school.

942
01:06:41,750 --> 01:06:42,583
Cu.

943
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,041
Yes?

944
01:06:47,875 --> 01:06:49,208
Who was that?

945
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,083
My teacher.

946
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:52,833
Can he drink?

947
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:56,583
What was that for?

948
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:01,208
You get liquor for going to school?

949
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,875
For a singer,
breathing is very important.

950
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:05,708
Two.

951
01:07:07,208 --> 01:07:08,791
Three.

952
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,125
You gotta eat more veggies and fruits.

953
01:07:16,208 --> 01:07:18,958
That would help with your problem,
you know?

954
01:07:19,291 --> 01:07:20,375
Yes sir.

955
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,291
And don't be afraid of the restroom.

956
01:07:23,375 --> 01:07:25,958
To me, it's one of the most
relaxing places.

957
01:07:26,750 --> 01:07:29,583
Stay there, I'll play you a melody.

958
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,583
I did it, teacher.

959
01:07:44,791 --> 01:07:46,916
Today, we will review the last lesson.

960
01:07:47,166 --> 01:07:51,791
It's calculating by
dividing numbers to their tenths.

961
01:07:51,875 --> 01:07:52,958
Did you do the homework?

962
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:54,375
Yes sir.

963
01:07:54,458 --> 01:07:55,708
Who will volunteer?

964
01:07:58,875 --> 01:07:59,708
Shrimp.

965
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:11,791
Very nice.

966
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:18,291
82 sir.

967
01:08:23,208 --> 01:08:24,375
158 sir.

968
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,333
Harder?

969
01:08:31,541 --> 01:08:32,958
257 sir.

970
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,125
663 sir.

971
01:08:45,458 --> 01:08:46,708
-Harder?
-Okay.

972
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,541
This is difficult,

973
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:57,250
so I'll let you think at your seat
for five minutes.

974
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:00,458
It's 2750 sir.

975
01:09:07,875 --> 01:09:09,041
How are you so good today?

976
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:11,541
As long as you're not yelling at me.

977
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:18,208
Go, go.

978
01:09:21,041 --> 01:09:22,291
Get it, teacher.

979
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,458
Get it, teacher.

980
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,250
Go, go.

981
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:31,500
Okay, here we are.

982
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:35,000
Come on Shrimp.

983
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:41,416
Oh, so many people.

984
01:09:46,458 --> 01:09:47,875
These people want to see you.

985
01:09:48,875 --> 01:09:50,041
Hi, Hoang.

986
01:09:50,583 --> 01:09:52,041
My name is An. This is Le,

987
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:54,916
the Music Director of
the talent show Let's Shine.

988
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,000
Hello.

989
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,375
We couldn't get a hold of you,
so here we are.

990
01:10:02,833 --> 01:10:04,708
Your video is very impressive.

991
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:13,916
Awesome!

992
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:19,000
There are many great clips sent to us.

993
01:10:19,458 --> 01:10:23,083
But to be honest,
our team was most impressed with yours.

994
01:10:26,291 --> 01:10:27,958
You shot everything on a phone?

995
01:10:30,041 --> 01:10:31,250
Congratulations.

996
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,250
Thank you.

997
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,250
Our team have decided

998
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,541
we would like... this boy

999
01:10:39,541 --> 01:10:40,958
to be in the finale.

1000
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,250
Come here.

1001
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:53,375
What's your name?

1002
01:10:53,458 --> 01:10:54,458
Cu.

1003
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,041
Your real name.

1004
01:10:57,375 --> 01:10:58,291
Yeah, Cu.

1005
01:10:58,458 --> 01:10:59,458
Cu?

1006
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,541
Did you have singing lessons?

1007
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:03,958
Yes, my mom taught me.

1008
01:11:05,375 --> 01:11:07,625
Could you please allow us
to test him a little?

1009
01:11:11,958 --> 01:11:13,083
If that's okay with you.

1010
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,458
Go ahead.

1011
01:11:18,458 --> 01:11:19,833
Thank you. Come over here.

1012
01:11:25,375 --> 01:11:26,291
How old are you?

1013
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,166
I'm nine.

1014
01:11:29,416 --> 01:11:30,291
Wait.

1015
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,250
For the finale,
we have ten amazing performances.

1016
01:11:33,708 --> 01:11:36,166
So I think you guys should prepare

1017
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,708
something really spectacular for him.

1018
01:11:39,166 --> 01:11:40,333
I trust you can do that.

1019
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,375
Are you ready?

1020
01:11:46,541 --> 01:11:48,708
-Yes.
-Let's go to Saigon for the finale.

1021
01:11:48,875 --> 01:11:49,958
Okay.

1022
01:11:51,291 --> 01:11:52,833
Are you crazy?

1023
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:56,250
I will never shine.

1024
01:11:57,291 --> 01:12:00,000
This stupid village will kill my dream.

1025
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,375
My passion.

1026
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:03,666
And you.

1027
01:12:03,875 --> 01:12:04,916
And your Weasel dad.

1028
01:12:05,291 --> 01:12:06,208
The kids.

1029
01:12:06,291 --> 01:12:07,583
That poorer than poor school.

1030
01:12:08,708 --> 01:12:09,916
I don't owe you anything.

1031
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:13,833
No one wants to disappoint you.

1032
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:15,375
You.

1033
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:17,916
You will die alone on this island.

1034
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:20,958
Because no stupid man will stay here.

1035
01:12:22,875 --> 01:12:25,000
You talk like that as a teacher?

1036
01:12:27,208 --> 01:12:28,125
Right.

1037
01:12:28,583 --> 01:12:30,958
There's nothing valuable here
to make you stay.

1038
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:34,208
What are the kids to you?

1039
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:39,000
And me...

1040
01:12:39,875 --> 01:12:42,291
I'll die alone with the dream
of changing life here.

1041
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:47,583
My dad?

1042
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:49,958
You think he's a liar?

1043
01:12:51,291 --> 01:12:52,791
Yes, he's a liar.

1044
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:00,750
He sold his bike

1045
01:13:01,791 --> 01:13:03,958
to throw you that party.

1046
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:11,458
He always tries
to hide all the difficulties here.

1047
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,166
Hiding his sickness too.

1048
01:13:28,125 --> 01:13:31,291
All to make you feel welcome here.

1049
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:35,875
Because the kids really need
a teacher who loves them.

1050
01:13:38,208 --> 01:13:40,208
That's my dad's last wish

1051
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:43,125
that he has to do before he dies.

1052
01:13:48,666 --> 01:13:50,166
Probably not long from now.

1053
01:14:33,458 --> 01:14:38,708
LOVE YOU TEACHER

1054
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:48,208
Teacher, are we still going to school?

1055
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:57,125
Dad.

1056
01:14:57,291 --> 01:14:59,000
Dad, please.

1057
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:01,583
Shut up.

1058
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,458
How dare you disobey me?

1059
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:07,541
Mom gave me that guitar.

1060
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,583
Shut up.

1061
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:11,291
I forbid you to sing.

1062
01:15:12,166 --> 01:15:14,291
You like singing like your mom.

1063
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,416
She pursued singing and was corrupted.

1064
01:15:17,875 --> 01:15:20,125
She left you for some dude, don't you see?

1065
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,583
You're lying.

1066
01:15:21,666 --> 01:15:24,125
She left because you hit her.

1067
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:27,583
You're talking back now?

1068
01:15:29,333 --> 01:15:33,458
I want to be on the show
so mom can see me on TV.

1069
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:36,791
The show?

1070
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:38,416
If you wanna sing...

1071
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,583
then get out of my house.

1072
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,458
I forbid you.

1073
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,166
You wanna sing?

1074
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:45,750
Go follow your crazy mom.

1075
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,458
You can't call her that.

1076
01:15:49,666 --> 01:15:52,250
-You!
-Don't call her that.

1077
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:54,041
Get out of my house.

1078
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:57,250
-Get out!
-You can't talk about her like that.

1079
01:16:28,458 --> 01:16:29,416
Cu!

1080
01:16:30,458 --> 01:16:31,541
Cu.

1081
01:16:34,125 --> 01:16:36,166
Cu...

1082
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:00,250
Hoang.

1083
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:02,625
Have you seen Cu?

1084
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,208
He ran out of the house.

1085
01:17:06,583 --> 01:17:07,666
In this weather?

1086
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:09,666
His dad hit him.

1087
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:10,791
Let's go, let's go.

1088
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:12,125
Let's spread out to find him.

1089
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:13,500
Mr. Bay, go to the pineapple field.

1090
01:17:13,583 --> 01:17:15,500
You to the beach. The rest follow me.

1091
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:21,583
Cu.

1092
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:23,250
There he is!

1093
01:17:31,416 --> 01:17:33,125
Are you crazy? You can't swim.

1094
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,708
Everyone stay here, it's dangerous!

1095
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,416
Be careful!

1096
01:17:58,083 --> 01:17:59,208
Where are you going?

1097
01:18:00,916 --> 01:18:02,708
I gotta go find my mom.

1098
01:18:03,083 --> 01:18:06,166
She got him.

1099
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:21,750
TEACHER HOANG IN QUY VILLAGE

1100
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:29,958
Teacher...

1101
01:19:30,208 --> 01:19:31,375
We're here.

1102
01:19:56,208 --> 01:19:57,708
There's a boat to the mainland.

1103
01:19:58,166 --> 01:19:59,750
You should get going.

1104
01:20:01,416 --> 01:20:02,291
I'm sorry

1105
01:20:03,333 --> 01:20:06,416
for bothering you with our affairs.

1106
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:10,625
About Cu...

1107
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:13,333
His dad won't let him join the show.

1108
01:20:17,041 --> 01:20:19,541
{\an8}LET'S SHINE INVITATION

1109
01:20:33,416 --> 01:20:35,541
What are you doing?
He's not going to school.

1110
01:20:35,666 --> 01:20:36,541
-Ouch.
-Teacher, please...

1111
01:20:36,791 --> 01:20:39,083
-Please don't.
-Does it hurt?

1112
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,375
Of course.

1113
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:43,333
How can a grown man like you
hit a child like him?

1114
01:20:43,666 --> 01:20:44,666
He's my kid.

1115
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:45,833
So what?

1116
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,375
I can teach him my way.

1117
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:50,458
If you ever hit him again,
I will not let it slide.

1118
01:20:51,083 --> 01:20:53,250
Drinking all day...
Why don't you drown in it?

1119
01:20:54,541 --> 01:20:56,666
What kind of man hits women and children?

1120
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,208
Coward.

1121
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:09,291
Thank you.

1122
01:21:17,833 --> 01:21:19,833
I can't go to Saigon.

1123
01:21:21,083 --> 01:21:22,250
Why not?

1124
01:21:22,875 --> 01:21:24,041
I'm scared.

1125
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:25,958
My dad always call me a loser.

1126
01:21:26,458 --> 01:21:29,083
I won't be anything when I grow up.

1127
01:21:29,708 --> 01:21:31,750
Anyone that says you can't do it,

1128
01:21:32,333 --> 01:21:33,375
don't believe them.

1129
01:21:34,125 --> 01:21:36,416
Why would you let someone
decide your dream?

1130
01:21:37,125 --> 01:21:39,708
But... the other kids are good.

1131
01:21:49,875 --> 01:21:52,250
Do you know why I didn't
graduate from music school?

1132
01:21:53,458 --> 01:21:55,625
What did you say? I'm not talented?

1133
01:21:56,708 --> 01:21:58,000
You're just not patient with me.

1134
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,958
You'll never be a singer.

1135
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:03,541
I'll prove you wrong.

1136
01:22:06,791 --> 01:22:08,208
I've always thought I was right.

1137
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,375
Then I heard you sing

1138
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:13,875
and realized they were right.

1139
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,291
You have something that I don't.

1140
01:22:21,916 --> 01:22:22,958
It's called a gift.

1141
01:22:24,583 --> 01:22:27,583
Don't ever bury your dream
just because you're shy.

1142
01:22:28,416 --> 01:22:29,958
Let's prove to your dad

1143
01:22:30,291 --> 01:22:32,458
that he was wrong
not to let you follow your dream.

1144
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,375
Don't be sad.

1145
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:43,125
More than sad.

1146
01:22:45,166 --> 01:22:46,166
It is disappointment.

1147
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:56,625
But now...

1148
01:22:58,375 --> 01:22:59,625
I'm proud of myself.

1149
01:23:02,791 --> 01:23:03,666
Now,

1150
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:07,041
I can go to the graves of my parents

1151
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:09,916
and tell them

1152
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:13,625
I've tried really hard,

1153
01:23:15,625 --> 01:23:17,416
and I will keep trying...

1154
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,333
to shine.

1155
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:24,166
Maybe... not on a stage

1156
01:23:29,541 --> 01:23:30,750
but somewhere else.

1157
01:23:34,125 --> 01:23:35,666
My parents would be happy.

1158
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:46,583
Okay.

1159
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:51,291
Let's see who gets to the school first.

1160
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,458
All of us will help you shine.

1161
01:24:01,875 --> 01:24:03,541
Will I be famous?

1162
01:24:04,083 --> 01:24:05,208
Of course.

1163
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:08,125
-I'll write you a song about your mom.
-Really?

1164
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:13,875
Dear Ms. Principal,

1165
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,541
I have a favor to ask.

1166
01:24:17,541 --> 01:24:19,416
I need to borrow our school choir.

1167
01:24:20,041 --> 01:24:23,291
I've attached here the music
I'd like them to practice.

1168
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:26,208
You'll understand what I'm doing.

1169
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,500
I have to succeed this time.

1170
01:24:29,208 --> 01:24:31,291
Has anyone come by the school
looking for me?

1171
01:24:31,625 --> 01:24:34,875
If so, please tell them
I'm teaching in the States.

1172
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:35,833
Thank you very much.

1173
01:24:41,125 --> 01:24:42,250
And one day,

1174
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:46,125
just as in the prophecy and her belief,
the dream came true.

1175
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,916
Assol was carried away by Prince Grey

1176
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,625
on a ship with scarlet sails,

1177
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,791
to all the villagers' astonishment.

1178
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:58,416
From then on they lived
happily ever after.

1179
01:25:01,541 --> 01:25:03,708
Do they get to kiss?

1180
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
For sure.

1181
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:07,791
-Whoa, that's beautiful!
-What is it?

1182
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:11,708
-It's so tall.
-I want to see, too.

1183
01:25:11,791 --> 01:25:14,125
-So handsome.
-This one is lower.

1184
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:17,250
-Whoa.
-You too.

1185
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:26,291
Look how tall the towers are.

1186
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,166
-Go get ready.
-Yes.

1187
01:26:09,541 --> 01:26:10,625
You will shine.

1188
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:17,083
Will my mom see me?

1189
01:26:18,958 --> 01:26:20,041
Of course.

1190
01:26:23,041 --> 01:26:24,458
-These go there.
-OK.

1191
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:26,875
You never focus.

1192
01:26:27,208 --> 01:26:29,208
Millions of people are watching.

1193
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:31,083
Help them, and I'll help you.

1194
01:26:31,708 --> 01:26:34,500
Remember, pull the sun up right away.

1195
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,458
I know, you keep saying that.

1196
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Mr. Weasel,

1197
01:26:38,541 --> 01:26:39,541
are you okay?

1198
01:26:39,625 --> 01:26:40,458
Of course I am.

1199
01:26:40,541 --> 01:26:41,958
You forget that all the time.

1200
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:43,208
Trust me.

1201
01:26:43,916 --> 01:26:45,958
I want to ask about your health.

1202
01:26:47,500 --> 01:26:49,333
I'm fine.

1203
01:26:52,125 --> 01:26:53,375
Guys like you have to live.

1204
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,041
I'll take you to the hospital.

1205
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:58,583
The conditions here are better.

1206
01:26:59,916 --> 01:27:01,125
What for?

1207
01:27:06,833 --> 01:27:07,875
I love you.

1208
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,375
Did somene tell you I'm dying?

1209
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:27,125
I told her to say that
so you would feel sorry for me.

1210
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,750
You're very easy to trick.

1211
01:27:37,333 --> 01:27:39,750
Sir, should I submit
to the show next year?

1212
01:27:39,833 --> 01:27:41,291
You gotta love people.

1213
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:43,583
Okay.

1214
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,750
On a dreamy day

1215
01:28:15,500 --> 01:28:17,916
My heart wonders

1216
01:28:18,916 --> 01:28:20,750
All these emotions

1217
01:28:21,083 --> 01:28:23,500
Are as strong as waves

1218
01:28:24,583 --> 01:28:27,791
What was once a childish dream

1219
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:30,625
Now becomes so real

1220
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:35,250
Please don't be a dream

1221
01:28:36,541 --> 01:28:38,833
We were once together

1222
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:41,583
Those days flew by

1223
01:28:42,500 --> 01:28:44,750
So many things to say

1224
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:47,833
But all were unspoken

1225
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,333
Tiny waves hanging by the shore

1226
01:28:51,791 --> 01:28:54,583
More gentle than ever before

1227
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:59,125
Mom, do you know I'm missing you?

1228
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:05,083
Mom, do you know I'm missing you?

1229
01:29:05,666 --> 01:29:09,750
Mommy, don't forget to come home

1230
01:29:09,833 --> 01:29:13,041
How far is the horizon?

1231
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:15,000
Please be here with me

1232
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:17,375
And grow up with me

1233
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:21,666
Mommy, what will be left behind

1234
01:29:21,833 --> 01:29:24,916
When everything has passed us by?

1235
01:29:25,208 --> 01:29:29,916
One morning I'll wake up to you

1236
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:36,958
One morning I'll wake up to you

1237
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,916
Cu sings so well.

1238
01:29:48,791 --> 01:29:51,250
We were once together

1239
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:53,958
Those days flew by

1240
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:56,416
So many things to say

1241
01:29:57,083 --> 01:29:59,375
But all were unspoken

1242
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:03,500
Tiny waves hanging by the shore

1243
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:06,625
More gentle than ever before

1244
01:30:07,083 --> 01:30:08,500
Mom, do you know

1245
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:11,583
I'm missing you?

1246
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:17,208
Mom, do you know I'm missing you?

1247
01:30:17,750 --> 01:30:21,458
Mommy, don't forget to come home

1248
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,916
How far is the horizon?

1249
01:30:25,208 --> 01:30:26,958
Please be here with me

1250
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:29,500
And grow up with me

1251
01:30:29,583 --> 01:30:33,625
Mommy, what will be left behind

1252
01:30:33,875 --> 01:30:36,958
When everything has passed us by

1253
01:30:37,041 --> 01:30:41,791
One morning I'll wake up to you

1254
01:30:43,291 --> 01:30:47,250
One morning I'll wake up to you

1255
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:51,541
Mommy, don't forget to come home

1256
01:30:51,791 --> 01:30:55,166
How far is the horizon?

1257
01:30:55,250 --> 01:30:59,625
Please be here with me and grow up with me

1258
01:30:59,708 --> 01:31:03,208
Mommy, what will be left behind

1259
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:07,041
When everything has passed us by?

1260
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:11,541
One morning I'll wake up to you

1261
01:31:13,125 --> 01:31:18,750
One morning I'll wake up to you

1262
01:31:19,291 --> 01:31:24,333
One morning I'll wake up to you

1263
01:31:25,208 --> 01:31:26,833
One morning

1264
01:31:26,916 --> 01:31:32,416
I'll wake up to you

1265
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:16,958
Mommy, mommy

1266
01:32:18,291 --> 01:32:19,416
You!

1267
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,166
Don't forget to pay me, okay?

1268
01:32:46,083 --> 01:32:48,625
Come on, let's go fishing

1269
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:52,833
Our village sings through day and night

1270
01:32:53,041 --> 01:32:54,083
Come on, let's reach...

1271
01:32:54,166 --> 01:32:56,125
Congratulations.

1272
01:33:00,541 --> 01:33:01,791
Can I talk to you?

1273
01:33:05,458 --> 01:33:06,875
I've listened to your songs.

1274
01:33:07,333 --> 01:33:08,416
We should collaborate.

1275
01:33:11,041 --> 01:33:12,375
Do you want the kid?

1276
01:33:12,458 --> 01:33:13,458
I want you.

1277
01:33:15,750 --> 01:33:16,833
Here's my name card.

1278
01:33:19,291 --> 01:33:20,291
Good luck.

1283
01:34:19,541 --> 01:34:21,375
I'm very honored and happy as an artist

1284
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:26,000
that my music is loved by so many people.

1285

I really appreciate it.

1286
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:31,833

1288

-Teacher!
-Teacher is back!

1289
01:36:52,958 --> 01:36:53,916
Give me a moment.

1290
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:07,750
You bought that?

1291
01:37:08,208 --> 01:37:09,208
So rich now.

1292
01:37:09,458 --> 01:37:10,458
No, just renting it.

1293
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,250
Do you still need a teacher?

1294
01:37:14,416 --> 01:37:16,541
Isn't it better being an artist?

1295
01:37:18,083 --> 01:37:19,958
I only shine as a teacher.

1296
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:25,041
You don't hate dried squid anymore?

1297
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:26,333
Still do.

1298
01:37:26,666 --> 01:37:27,833
Hate it so much.

1299
01:37:28,541 --> 01:37:30,166
I'll dip it in wasabi

1300
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,250
and eat it raw.

1301
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:40,250
Stay here with us teacher!

1302
01:37:40,333 --> 01:37:42,583
Please stay,
I don't poop my pants anymore.

1303
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:44,250
Stay and teach us how to sing!

1304
01:37:44,375 --> 01:37:46,791
Sam, can you ask him to stay?

1305
01:37:47,458 --> 01:37:49,541
Hey, answer them.

1306
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:52,083
-You two make a good couple.
-This is so fun!

1307
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:53,875
He agreed!

1308
01:37:54,375 --> 01:37:56,916
You guys should prepare for their wedding!

1309
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:58,416
Get them!

1310
01:37:58,500 --> 01:38:00,541
-Why are you running so fast?
-Wait for us!

1311
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,750
Let's go together!

1312
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:04,291
We are!

1313
01:38:04,375 --> 01:38:06,875
We kids just tell the truth.

1314
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:12,166
Life is not always the dream
we've been waiting for.

1315
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:14,750
But every day is a new journey.

1316
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,291
Don't worry.

1317
01:38:16,375 --> 01:38:17,458
Just keep going!

1318
01:38:24,041 --> 01:38:26,000
Thank you for listening to my story.

1319
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:28,666
Invite others, the more the merrier.

1320
01:38:29,083 --> 01:38:30,875
I will tell it over and over again.

1321
01:38:31,875 --> 01:38:37,000
Good morning teacher.

1322
01:38:38,416 --> 01:38:40,791
Today, we'll write an essay.

1323
01:38:40,875 --> 01:38:43,458
Let's write about
what you like most on this island.

1324
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,125
I like rain.

1325
01:38:45,625 --> 01:38:46,958
I like the boats.

1326
01:38:47,125 --> 01:38:48,375
I like the sun.

1327
01:38:48,833 --> 01:38:50,333
I like my mom.

1328
01:38:50,416 --> 01:38:51,541
I like the ocean.

1329
01:38:51,875 --> 01:38:53,125
I like the fish.

1330
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,750
I like you.

1331
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:58,083
Let's do this.

1332
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:28,625
Everyone, we still have
another scene after the credits.

1333
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:31,583
Hang in there and watch the credits.
It won't take long.

1334
01:39:32,125 --> 01:39:34,375
Security, close the doors.
Don't let anyone out.

1335
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:38,916
That's all. Thank you everyone.
