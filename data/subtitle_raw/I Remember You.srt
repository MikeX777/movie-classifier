00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ripped, corrected and synched
by Fingersmaster. Enjoy!

2
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,082
Forgive me.

3
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,046
Do this, like you're lifting weights.

4
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,402
All the way, yes.

5
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,722
Turn it around.

6
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,305
Stretch out your fingers.

7
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,243
You have a phone call on line two.
The police.

8
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,001
Thanks... Freyr.

9
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,283
You locked the car, right?

10
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,644
Fuck.

11
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,011
This is Isafjorour.
It should be all right.

12
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,526
I'm joking. Relax.
Of course I locked the car.

13
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,890
Lif. Take a picture.

14
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,450
- Hello. Dagny.
- Hello. Freyr.

15
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,564
- Have you done this before?
- No. I haven't.

16
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,963
I called Gerour, she's a pathologist
and went over it with her.

17
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,685
I've got a checklist.

18
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,250
Morning.

19
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,968
Halla Unnsteinsdottir.

20
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,845
71 years old.
Lived in Flateyri.

21
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,970
Did she do all this?

22
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,729
So it seems.

23
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,010
Let's cut her down
now that you are here.

24
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,364
Boys.

25
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,490
Will you do the autopsy?

26
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,007
Gerour will do it
when she arrives tomorrow.

27
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,081
He found her.

28
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,650
I see.

29
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,800
Hello... Freyr.

30
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,681
- I'm a doctor at the hospital.
- Einar Guojonsson.

31
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,410
Please.

32
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,847
When people die like this...

33
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,048
Hang themselves...

34
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,288
Then the cause of death is

35
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,843
that blood is no longer
flowing to the brain.

36
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,810
People lose consciousness very quickly.

37
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,603
It's rather painless.

38
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,683
Almost like falling asleep.

39
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,289
Aren't you...

40
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,330
a psychiatrist?

41
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,084
Freyr!

42
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:05,489
Thank you for your words in there.

43
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,802
What you said... it consoled me.

44
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,351
Especially since it was you
who said it.

45
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:14,066
After all you've had to go through.

46
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,265
Yeah.

47
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,200
It's hard to imagine
how you can get over

48
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,044
a thing like that.

49
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,005
Everybody...
has to deal with something.

50
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,089
You do it one day at a time.

51
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,567
Children don't just disappear
in Iceland.

52
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,329
I just...
Just don't understand it.

53
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,721
Yet that's what happened to my Benni.

54
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,642
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

55
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,965
- Are you going to sleep in the house?
- Yes.

56
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,969
You think that's a bad idea?

57
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,325
Nobody's lived in that house
since the town was abandoned.

58
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,164
I know.

59
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,483
- You weren't with them last summer?
- No, I couldn't make it.

60
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,647
Welcome to Last Sight.

61
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,848
- Do you like it?
- Well...

62
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,321
There is a lot to be done.

63
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,848
- It was quite different last summer.
- I know that.

64
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,323
It'll all be different in a week's time.

65
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,721
What are you going to do
with this house?

66
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,690
We are going to turn it
into a bed and breakfast.

67
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,289
There's a lot of tourists here
in the summer.

68
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,171
The only guesthouse here
was booked solid last summer.

69
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,570
- Isn't it rotten through?
- No.

70
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,802
The timber's quite solid.

71
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,330
Try it.

72
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,286
- It works.
- Nice.

73
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,409
- There's a lot of space up here.
- Don't you think?

74
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,890
I was wondering...

75
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,646
We could have bunk beds here...

76
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,163
And a cozy reading corner here.

77
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,768
This must have been the children's room?

78
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,085
Yes. It looks like it.

79
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,010
Hey.

80
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,246
How are you?
I haven't seen you since summer.

81
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,043
Thanks for asking.
I'm much better.

82
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,281
I feel like I've said goodbye to him.

83
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,007
- I've stopped taking the drugs.
- I meet with a psychologist once a week.

84
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,204
He says you never get
completely over it.

85
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,928
Isn't this the Doctor's house,
where you stayed last summer?

86
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,523
Yes. It is.

87
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,768
I'll see you in a week.

88
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,569
- Yes.
- But...

89
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,883
If something happens
then you can call me.

90
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,000
I thought there was no reception here.

91
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,364
Well... You've to go up the hill
to get reception.

92
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,162
But all right.

93
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,802
Getting into shape, are we?

94
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,765
Yes.

95
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,490
Just...

96
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,644
Also to clear the mind.
It helps with that.

97
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,728
- Do you run?
- No.

98
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,531
I find nothing more boring
than running around in circles.

99
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,447
At least you are
getting to know the town.

100
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,887
You've run up and down all the streets.

101
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,005
You could say that.

102
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,561
- I live here at number 23.
- You do?

103
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,569
Should we have a cup of coffee?

104
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,044
Yes.

105
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,969
Let's do that.

106
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,082
In my profession they would say

107
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,408
this is a clear sign
of compulsive behavior.

108
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,441
I woke up here the other day and

109
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,650
and couldn't remember
what Benni looked like.

110
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,043
What do you think happened?

111
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,490
Oh, I'm sorry.

112
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,529
No, no. It's all right.

113
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,968
Benni was playing hide and seek
with a friend of his

114
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,163
when he went missing.

115
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,531
When eight year old boys
are playing hide and seek

116
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,526
they don't hide behind
a street light or a bush.

117
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,891
They can be very ambitious.

118
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,569
And then...

119
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,488
They searched everywhere.

120
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,881
Everywhere.
Back and forth.

121
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,687
Hundreds of people searched for him.

122
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,569
All over the country.

123
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,566
Do you have any hope he is still alive?

124
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,489
No, Benni isn't alive.

125
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,490
Benni had congenital diabetes.

126
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,607
He had just been injected with insulin
when he went out to play.

127
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,930
That means that...

128
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,529
if he didn't get anything to eat
for hours

129
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,887
then the body would go into shock.

130
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,803
So he would have lost consciousness.

131
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,567
Do you still want that cup of coffee?

132
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,365
Hi.

133
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,691
Hi.

134
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,247
I think your wife is a bit cold.

135
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,722
Is that so?

136
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,045
I want you.

137
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,444
Lif.

138
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,044
Lif!

139
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,844
I'm about to fuck my husband.

140
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,889
Stop it.

141
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,363
Are you sure you're ready?

142
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,530
Don't you want to?

143
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,964
Of course.

144
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,404
Mom.

145
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,089
Mom.

146
00:20:34,739 --> 00:20:35,739
Hi.

147
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,244
- Hi.
- Hi.

148
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,385
Are you OK?

149
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,590
Yes, I was just trying
to get Garoar to understand

150
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,411
that if we want a toilet
we need running water

151
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,166
and we don't have it
until next summer.

152
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,825
So if your little prince
can't poop in a bucket,

153
00:20:49,926 --> 00:20:51,730
he has to hold it in.

154
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,490
Crazy.

155
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,244
How are you?

156
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,210
Good to see you.

157
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,683
- Where were you?
- I took a walk around the area

158
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,169
and found the cemetery.

159
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,488
The cemetery?
Did you see any ghosts?

160
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,809
Hello.

161
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,000
It was great to get back to work.

162
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,646
Are you trying to make
the house into a sauna?

163
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,770
- The stove is out of control.
- You're out of control.

164
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,563
Isn't it amazing

165
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,166
that no one has lived in this house
for 60 years?

166
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,525
It's time for this house
to live a new life.

167
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,085
- New Lif.
- Very funny.

168
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,403
That was a lame drum roll.

169
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,568
Well, I'm going.

170
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,324
To sleep.

171
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,369
Good night.

172
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,045
I'll come with you.

173
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,883
- Good night.
- Good night.

174
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,008
I'll turn the generator off.

175
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,003
The newest scars are brand new.

176
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,248
Made during the last 24 hours.

177
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,004
The oldest ones...

178
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,009
They are three or four years old.

179
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,084
All of them crosses.

180
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,763
I think it's clear she couldn't have
done it all on her own.

181
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,364
Bjarni is here.

182
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,730
- The widower.
- Yes. Great.

183
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,761
The fact is that

184
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,723
the marriage was

185
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,641
going downhill the last few years.

186
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,610
Why was that?

187
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:20,607
I really don't know.

188
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,402
Maybe because you abused her?

189
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,210
Never!

190
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,643
Why on earth do you think that?

191
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,884
Why crosses?
Are you religious, Bjarni?

192
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,044
I swear that I never hurt my Halla.

193
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,603
Do you know of anyone
who could have wanted to hurt her?

194
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,005
No.

195
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,563
Once, when she woke up

196
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,602
lnoficed

197
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,725
some blood
on the back of her nightdress.

198
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,566
She said she had eczema.

199
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,330
Does the name Bernodus
have any meaning for you?

200
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,850
No.

201
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,529
Fine.

202
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,650
Do you believe him?

203
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:28,846
His daughter just confirmed that he
was with her down south all week.

204
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,042
So he didn't make the new scars.

205
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,200
So it's unlikely that he did the others.

206
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,170
Yes.

207
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,644
She said something else as well.

208
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:43,486
She said Halla became
reclusive and distant

209
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,881
when a good friend of hers died.

210
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,211
It often happens with people at that age
when their friends start to die.

211
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,284
They become depressed when they realize
their own end is coming closer.

212
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,207
Didn't you say Gerour
would do the autopsy.

213
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,408
Yes, she'll be here at noon.

214
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,931
So why did you check
the back of the body?

215
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,366
What?

216
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,804
I was just working late. And...

217
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,962
The power went so...

218
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,891
So I went...
Down to the cellar.

219
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,449
I just wanted to make sure
everything was ready for the autopsy.

220
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,244
Why are you so embarrassed?

221
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,002
Who was it

222
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,483
you asked him about?

223
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,210
Yes...

224
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,045
Bernodus.

225
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,249
It would actually be great to get your
professional opinion on one thing.

226
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,767
Do you have time
to go down to the station?

227
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,811
We found an old case connected to
the church where Halla was found.

228
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:03,846
The police chief back then
was also a prolific amateur filmmaker.

229
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,327
The church was disassembled

230
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,528
and moved from Hesteyri in 1956

231
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,762
after the village was abandoned.

232
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,527
The former villagers were not happy
about it, to put it mildly.

233
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,690
Looks familiar?

234
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,083
- What year did you say it was?
- 1956.

235
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,169
60 years ago.

236
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,961
Veigar, do you have the new pictures?

237
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,690
Do you think this was done
by the same person?

238
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,969
Yes, absolutely.
I mean...

239
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,284
You see how it is done.

240
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,966
All capitals except the E's.

241
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,845
The circle over the I...
I think it is obvious.

242
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,888
So Halla did this?
Was she from Hesteyri?

243
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:03,323
You said the former villagers were
furious when the church was moved?

244
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,847
I did but she was from Isafjorour.

245
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,929
This photo was taken a year before
the church was damaged. In 1956.

246
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,245
Halla Unnsteinsdottir.
Here she is. Ten years old.

247
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,364
Why have some of the faces
been crossed out?

248
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,404
That's a good question.

249
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,447
This photo was found at this boy's home.

250
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,523
His name is Bernodus Pétursson.

251
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,890
And here it says...

252
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,007
Bernodus was caught in the act
of vandalizing the church.

253
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,569
And he was from Hesteyri.

254
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,526
And moved here.

255
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,526
Bernodus is part of another case
from that same time.

256
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,961
Only five days
after he was caught in the church...

257
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,920
He...

258
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,084
Bernodus Pétursson
went missing without a trace.

259
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,161
He has never been found.

260
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,329
God, I'm tired.

261
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,245
- Time for a beer?
- What a great idea. Dibs on not going.

262
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,925
Not going-

263
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,890
That's life, my dear.

264
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,885
Is it?

265
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,207
- No.
- Damn.

266
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,964
Great.

267
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,604
It's completely stuck.
I can't move it.

268
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,731
Did you take the pin?
Garoar?

269
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,931
What happened?
Did you fall in the creek?

270
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,969
No, I jumped into it.

271
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,201
What are you doing with a cross?

272
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,884
- Bergdis Ebenesardottir.
- It is supposed to be in the cemetery.

273
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,607
There was a hole in the ground
like a cross had been removed.

274
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,168
And then I found it in the creek.

275
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,005
What was it doing there?

276
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,289
How should I know?

277
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,242
And what, did you leave
the beer behind?

278
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,890
I just...

279
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,241
- ls the generator off?
- Yes.

280
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,405
We think it broke down.

281
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,281
It would be nice to have
a beer right now.

282
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,244
Not going!

283
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,371
OK.

284
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,650
Katrin.

285
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,845
Katrin.

286
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,764
No, don't.

287
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,400
- Don't move her. Katrin.
- Yes.

288
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,211
- Talk to me.
- Yes. I fell.

289
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,691
- You fell?
- Yes.

290
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,048
- Where did you hurt yourself?
- Here.

291
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,367
- The leg.
- Do you feel pain in your leg?

292
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,170
- Can you move?
- Yes.

293
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,690
- Can you sit?
- Yes.

294
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,085
Let me see.

295
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,204
- Is it broken?
- I don't know.

296
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,444
Does this hurt?

297
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,170
- Yes.
- What about this?

298
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,247
I'll go and try to call
for an emergency helicopter.

299
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,930
That's not necessary.

300
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,844
- It's just sprained.
- No, I'll try to contact the boat.

301
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,651
- Let the hospital take a look.
- Yes.

302
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:01,651
- I'm going to fix the pillow.
- Yes.

303
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,091
Do you want one?

304
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,964
- Two.
- Two.

305
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,363
Here you are.

306
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,804
Thank you.

307
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,569
- Lie down.
- Yes, wait.

308
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,406
I'll call the boat tomorrow, my love.

309
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,362
It's all arranged by years.

310
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,242
Bernodus was called Dirty.
And Unclean.

311
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,280
When he refused to take his clothes off
and take a shower after gym.

312
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,241
The scars were from different times.

313
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,051
It had been going on for some years.

314
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,411
18 crosses in total.

315
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,842
The poor boy seems to have been
abused for years.

316
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,806
The father was a drunk
and probably had mental issues.

317
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,406
It says here that he was
a church warden at Hesteyri

318
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,007
and was very angry
when the church was moved.

319
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:13,811
The school nurse wrote a report
but it seems to have been ignored.

320
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,324
How disgusting.

321
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,608
- Different times.
- Children weren't protected like today.

322
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,001
Nobody knew what
systematic bullying was.

323
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,725
His parents.

324
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,568
The mother, Bergdis Ebenesardottir
died when Bernodus was born.

325
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,927
The father probably blamed Bernodus.

326
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,650
Jesus.

327
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,290
See here.

328
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,767
Eight kids have been crossed out.

329
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,520
Halla is one of them.

330
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,446
Of those eight six are dead.

331
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,086
What?

332
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,248
Six out of eight dead?

333
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,925
- Before they turned 70?
- Exactly.

334
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,009
All died during the last three years.

335
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,646
And moreover...
All died in accidents.

336
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,088
Apart from Halla of course, she hung
herself. Gunnhildur Gisladéttir.

337
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,050
She drowned.

338
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,049
That was two years ago.

339
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,730
Jon AEvarsson.

340
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,441
He died of burn wounds. His house
caught fire in the middle of the night.

341
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,684
Sigvaldi Konraosson.
He froze to death.

342
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,810
He got lost walking on
Vatnajokull-glacier.

343
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,246
And then this one.
Steinn Gunnbjornsson.

344
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,925
He died in a car accident.

345
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,050
Eighteen months ago.

346
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,004
And finally, this one.

347
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,169
Védis Arngrimsdottir.

348
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,648
She was the first to die.

349
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,766
She fell on garden shears and bled out.

350
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,963
What? Were they sure it was an accident?

351
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,367
How do you fall on garden shears?

352
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,201
Could it be that Bernodus
just went into hiding somewhere?

353
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,842
Maybe he just fled to Reykjavik.
Changed his name.

354
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,403
Then he came back a few years ago
and sought his revenge.

355
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,370
Think about it.
The kids who are crossed out...

356
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,682
They bullied him terribly.

357
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,163
And now they are all dying
in mysterious ways.

358
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,883
So you are looking for a serial killer
who is 70 years old.

359
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,361
Sorry, I'm late.
Let's begin.

360
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,005
<i>Hello.</i>

361
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,644
<i>Hello, daddy.</i>

362
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,530
<i>Hello, daddy.</i>

363
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,210
<i>Is it fun?</i>

364
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,404
<i>See mommy.</i>

365
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,965
Hi.

366
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,211
I want to show you something.
Do you have some time?

367
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,169
Yes. Come in.

368
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,330
The last pictures of Benni
before he went missing.

369
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,207
From the gas station at Artlinshofoi.
And what do you want to show me?

370
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,490
I just got this.

371
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:46,723
This is from the autopsy of Vedis,
the one who fell on the garden shears.

372
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,211
God.

373
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,330
See...

374
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,723
Exactly the same pattern
as on Bernédus' back.

375
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,689
And on Halla's back.

376
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,728
Could it be some sort of religious cult?

377
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,042
All those crosses and...

378
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,927
The vandalism in the church. Unclean.

379
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,160
Those two are still alive.
What do they say about all this?

380
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,005
Well, this one, Ursula Astraosdottir...

381
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,409
- She is at a nursing home here in town.
- Ursula?

382
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,325
I've met her.

383
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,971
I have.

384
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,730
She is schizophrenic.

385
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,689
She didn't say a word
the two times I have met her.

386
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,291
And then this one.
Larus Helgason.

387
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,044
He is a farmer in Onundarfjorour.

388
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,242
I haven't been able to reach him.

389
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,170
He doesn't answer.

390
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,210
Hi.

391
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,725
Garoar.

392
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,170
Hello.

393
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,643
Dagny.

394
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,684
Hi, it's Dagny.

395
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,724
Is it Katrin?

396
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,010
Katrin.

397
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,884
Katrin, are you there?

398
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,925
Katrin.

399
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,249
What are you doing?

400
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,370
Are you OK?

401
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,925
What happened?

402
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,806
I swear...
There is someone down there.

403
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,963
There is someone, there is someone.

404
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,764
Down there?

405
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,568
What happened?
Talk to me.

406
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,725
There was...

407
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,406
I went downstairs.

408
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,641
The door shut and I couldn't open.

409
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,442
- I didn't know there was a cellar here.
- Girls.

410
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:04,081
Did you know there was a cellar here?

411
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,484
There is a corpse down there.

412
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,169
- What do you mean?
- There is a child's corpse down there!

413
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,448
- A child's corpse?
- When will the boat come?

414
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,250
We couldn't get reception.

415
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,244
We tried and tried.
There is no signal here.

416
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,847
- I can't stay here anymore.
- Me neither.

417
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:23,482
We have to try to call again.
Go further.

418
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:26,564
I can't stay in this fucking
house anymore.

419
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,290
I mean it.

420
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,766
- OK.
- We can go to the Doctor's house.

421
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,490
Yeah?

422
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,449
- How are you doing?
- I don't understand this.

423
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,804
The whole nation followed the story.

424
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,645
Not like this.
A total stranger.

425
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,280
Why the hell would he be
obsessed with Benni?

426
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,724
Maybe it was a hobby.
This is a very isolated place.

427
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,411
But I understand why
you find it uncomfortable.

428
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,607
Sometimes when I try to remember him

429
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:34,042
I only see this blue coat.

430
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,730
It was his favourite.

431
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,921
- Got the stretcher ready?
- In the car.

432
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,083
Do you know the cause of death?

433
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,362
We think he drank clog remover.

434
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:06,445
Are you sure nobody lived in the house
since the town was abandoned?

435
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,724
I don't think so.

436
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,610
This child must be connected
to the former owners.

437
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,731
It could be anyone.

438
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,883
No reception.

439
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,209
I'm going up
to get the beds ready.

440
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:57,644
Garoar!

441
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:02,810
- Garoar!
- Yes? What?

442
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,689
- Did you put it there?
- What?

443
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:06,490
This is not funny!

444
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,211
- I didn't put it there.
- Don't fuck with me!

445
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:12,564
- Did you bring it here?
- Are you crazy?

446
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,763
- Watch out!
- Are you kidding?

447
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,524
My dear.

448
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,724
Hello, Ursula.

449
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,410
It's me, Freyr.

450
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,040
The new doctor.
Remember me?

451
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,968
I want to ask you
a few questions if that's OK.

452
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,004
The photo.

453
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,362
Do you remember these kids?

454
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,044
That's you.

455
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:39,805
This boy here.

456
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,601
Bernodus Pétursson.

457
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,729
Do you remember him?

458
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:51,727
He vanished without a trace.

459
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,609
Was never seen again.

460
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,809
Ursula.

461
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,327
Do you know what happened to him?

462
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,529
Benni is at the bottom.

463
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,649
Everything is green.

464
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,569
What did you say?

465
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:23,521
Benni what?

466
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,488
What did you say?
Benni what?

467
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,211
Everything green?
What is green?

468
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,283
Ursula.

469
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,722
Answer me.
What did you say?

470
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,042
You said "Benni".
Why?

471
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,810
- Benni what?
- Freyr.

472
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,088
- Answer me. Ursula.
- Freyr.

473
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,444
You must remember it.

474
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,490
He said Benni hid himself
in a green submarine.

475
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,210
Don't you remember?

476
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,842
Can you take a look for me?

477
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,002
It's somewhere in the boxes.

478
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:12,365
Just...
I want to take a look at it.

479
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,410
Sure.

480
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,241
I'll take the first flight tomorrow.

481
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,809
What did Ursula say to you?

482
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,447
I thought she mentioned Benni
but it was rather unclear.

483
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,444
I have to go.

484
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,643
Katrin!

485
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:52,644
Katrin.

486
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,202
We have to get out of here.
We have to get out of here.

487
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:17,004
You have to eat, Katrin.

488
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:19,881
You haven't eaten
since yesterday morning.

489
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:31,689
I don't think we're alone here.

490
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,290
I saw...
I saw a small boy.

491
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,323
This was a big mistake.

492
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,525
To come all this way.

493
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,288
It's been such a short time since...

494
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:58,090
Since what?

495
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,324
Since I had to...

496
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,007
give birth... to our son?

497
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,447
- Stillborn. Say it.
- Kata.

498
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,251
- Why do you always have to do this?
- What?

499
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,971
Just, it was traumatic for me too.

500
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,530
All this nonsense,
nobody ever thinks about that.

501
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,684
You didn't speak to me...

502
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,688
I just felt like you thought
I was never doing enough.

503
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,489
Why was it so important to you
that Lif not come with us here?

504
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:51,965
Answer me.

505
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,646
What happened here
between you two last summer?

506
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,605
Things were over between us anyway.

507
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,444
Wasn't it?

508
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:20,489
Sometimes things just develop
in their own way.

509
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,967
Without you being able to control it.

510
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,724
Hello.

511
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,690
How have you been?

512
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:16,330
Freyr. You wanted to look
at the police reports?

513
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,005
Yes.

514
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:20,885
You know where they are.

515
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,087
"Olafur Magnusson,
eight years old, autistic."

516
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,364
"Cold. Very cold fingers.
I lost a mitten.

517
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,443
Benni hid in the green submarine."

518
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:51,924
Hello, On.

519
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,450
Do you remember us?

520
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,602
We're Benni's parents.

521
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,011
His mom is here.
You remember her.

522
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,810
Hi, On.

523
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,168
What are you doing?

524
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,362
Are you playing a video game?

525
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:23,444
On.

526
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:27,044
We want to ask you again
about the submarine.

527
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,449
Oli. Wait a second.

528
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,251
- On, is everything all right?
- Everything's fine.

529
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,402
Oli, can you describe it?

530
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:39,927
Oli, you said it was green.

531
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,165
Oli, it wasn't a submarine,
there are no submarines in Iceland!

532
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,847
- Why did you lie?
- Freyr.

533
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:49,685
- On!
- Freyr, let him go.

534
01:09:57,840 --> 01:09:59,524
Well...

535
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,764
How would the psychiatrist
describe his behaviour in there?

536
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:12,761
I want you to meet someone.

537
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,206
What do we have to discuss
with a lawyer?

538
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,011
I don't have time.
I have to catch a flight.

539
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,845
Hello.

540
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,562
- Elias Bjornsson.
- Hello. Freyr.

541
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,723
Can I offer you something to drink?
Water, coffee?

542
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,724
Excuse me.

543
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:47,491
What...

544
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,449
- What are we doing here?
- Freyr.

545
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,446
Elias has been an incredible
help to me for the last few months.

546
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:55,650
I see.

547
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,164
He has been in contact with Benni.

548
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,530
What?

549
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,561
It would be more accurate
to say that...

550
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,247
Benni made contact with me.

551
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,531
I don't have the time or inclination
for nonsense like this.

552
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:31,651
Freyr, you can at least listen to him.

553
01:11:35,160 --> 01:11:37,606
Vilhjalmur Alvar.
Arion Bank.

554
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,888
Tell him I'll call in ten minutes.

555
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,210
Listen.

556
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:46,930
Benni is trapped.

557
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,882
Trapped between two worlds.

558
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,087
Sometimes when the end of life
is somehow unresolved

559
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:56,601
people can't reach
the next plane of existence.

560
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:59,889
Like when...
the body can't be found

561
01:12:00,040 --> 01:12:02,964
or when nobody knows what happened.

562
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,926
The only thing that can release
these souls from their chains

563
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,321
is if their body is found.

564
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:15,327
And that the mystery
of their death is solved.

565
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,169
Is that so?

566
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:20,610
I see.

567
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,684
And What?

568
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,809
If those souls can't reach
the next plane of existence

569
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:35,608
they can get trapped.

570
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:39,488
And as more time goes by

571
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:41,529
the more powerful they become

572
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,242
and their problem can become obsession.

573
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,444
Bitterness. And anger.

574
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,285
They can make themselves visible.

575
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,968
They can travel around.

576
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:58,962
And then you who were part of his life
are in the biggest danger.

577
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,844
The thing is that Benni has to be found.

578
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:06,324
As soon as possible.

579
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,847
Or the consequences can be serious.

580
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,490
What do you think

581
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,805
we've been doing
for the last three years?

582
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,890
It has ruined our lives.

583
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,242
If I need a lawyer one day
I might contact you.

584
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,928
The name Bernodus.

585
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:44,648
Does it mean anything to you?

586
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:48,242
It is mentioned again and again.

587
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,289
But I can't explain why.

588
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,210
Ah, I slept so good.

589
01:14:25,680 --> 01:14:27,648
Have you eaten anything?

590
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,289
Where is Garoar?

591
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,081
Isn't everything OK?

592
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,206
Did you fuck him here on the counter?

593
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,489
Katrin.

594
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:21,168
What happened?

595
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,922
What did you say to her?

596
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,724
What...

597
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:32,769
I just told her the truth.

598
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,728
And what does that mean?

599
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,042
Not everything, of course.

600
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,683
- Why would you do that?
- She confronted me.

601
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:53,008
Didn't we decide to wait
until we came back to town?

602
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,888
Wasn't she just fishing?

603
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,362
No. Lif.

604
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,922
Katrin and I have been together
for twelve years.

605
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:06,487
I know her, I saw it in her eyes.

606
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,966
- She won't be able to handle it.
- No.

607
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,048
She's such a head case.

608
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,251
Lif.
Look at me.

609
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,769
It'll be all right.

610
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,483
Now we just have to

611
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,290
look to the future.

612
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:36,844
I love you.

613
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,570
No.

614
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,810
I'll go and call for help.

615
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:45,445
"If you see this I'm at the house.
Katrin knows about us."

616
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,968
"Are you sure I'm the father?"

617
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,684
Wait!

618
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:05,886
Ursula.

619
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,770
How did you get here?

620
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:21,930
He's not always so mean to me.

621
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,531
Who?

622
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,889
Bernodus.

623
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:30,209
Was he here with you in the boat?

624
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,050
Bernodus.

625
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,886
He's always with me.

626
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,286
Always.

627
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,760
We were always teasing him.

628
01:23:49,240 --> 01:23:53,165
I was the only one
who saw where he went.

629
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,090
I never told anyone.

630
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,689
Never.

631
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,164
Everything is green.

632
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,164
Green?

633
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:15,760
Where is everything green?
Ursula.

634
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,965
Bernodus went away with the boat.

635
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,925
What boat?
This one? The one we're in right now?

636
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,367
I never told anyone.

637
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:35,486
Never. No.

638
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,924
Everything is green.

639
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:40,964
Green.

640
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:43,281
Ursula.

641
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:46,201
Benni is at the bottom,
everything is green.

642
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:49,011
That's what you said.
That's what you said.

643
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,681
Remember?
Why did you say that?

644
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,649
Where is that?

645
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,326
Where is everything green?

646
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,327
Benni... Woke him up.

647
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:04,889
Benni woke him up?
Bernodus?

648
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:08,482
He shouldn't have woken him.

649
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,168
Ursula.

650
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,724
How are you feeling?

651
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:47,563
Why were you in that boat
in the middle of the night?

652
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:50,364
I saw a boy.

653
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:53,524
- I followed him here.
- Boy?

654
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:57,884
It was like...

655
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,640
he was asking me to follow him.

656
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:03,450
To Ursula.

657
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,286
Who was the boy?

658
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:12,329
I can't...

659
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:14,450
Freyr.

660
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:19,085
Bernodus.

661
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:22,410
I have seen him before.

662
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,609
I feel like that he is trying

663
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:29,603
to help me.

664
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,285
And that clairvoyant... who claims
to be in contact with Benni...

665
01:26:36,440 --> 01:26:39,728
He also mentioned him.
Bernodus.

666
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:43,487
Ursula also talked about Bernodus.

667
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:48,730
I fear that I'm losing my mind.

668
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,606
I'm becoming like
one of my patients.

669
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,842
Why can't I find him?

670
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,241
Why can't I find Benni?

671
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:28,725
- What is it?
- I need more green.

672
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:32,771
- I need more green.
- You should be asleep.

673
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,609
It's all right.

674
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,884
Hi.

675
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:36,203
Sorry, I was asleep.

676
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:38,161
What?

677
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,889
Sorry.

678
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:52,287
He has always said
Benni hid in a green submarine.

679
01:32:52,440 --> 01:32:54,010
And Ursula said:

680
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:57,530
Benni is at the bottom.
Everything is green.

681
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,603
Bottom of the ocean?

682
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,840
I don't know.

683
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,809
Let me check something.

684
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:26,965
Septic tank?

685
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,083
Take a look.

686
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:34,364
Wait.

687
01:33:34,520 --> 01:33:36,409
Do you still have the...

688
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,166
The video from the gas station?
Showing Benni?

689
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,684
Sure.

690
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:46,925
Here.

691
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,929
Let's see.

692
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:00,404
There.

693
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:04,562
I just didn't make the connection
until now.

694
01:34:06,320 --> 01:34:07,924
Wait.

695
01:34:22,840 --> 01:34:24,410
Those three.

696
01:34:24,640 --> 01:34:27,405
They were inside the gas station
when Benni walked out of there.

697
01:34:27,640 --> 01:34:28,846
And?

698
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:31,730
They eat a meal.

699
01:34:31,880 --> 01:34:34,281
That's why they were there
for so long.

700
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,482
This one is taken
out here in the tunnel.

701
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:42,166
You can't see
what's on the trailer.

702
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,408
Here it is.

703
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:54,925
Hesteyri.

704
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:13,445
The search for Benni must have been
in full swing at the time.

705
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:17,363
So you probably weren't paying
attention to other news.

706
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,083
There is an abandoned whaling station
just outside of the village.

707
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:28,205
There they found the bodies of
Garoar Magnusson and Lif Einarsdottir.

708
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:31,441
Lif was pregnant with their child.

709
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,163
Katrin Porsdottir,
Garoar's wife...

710
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,164
She probably tried to seek help on foot.

711
01:35:40,200 --> 01:35:43,329
Her body has never been found
despite an extensive search.

712
01:35:43,680 --> 01:35:47,082
Lif's phone was found
with Katrin's fingerprints on it.

713
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:49,851
She had tried to call for help.

714
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,640
I always thought it was misguided
to try to fix up this old shack.

715
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,568
It's rotten through and through.

716
01:38:43,240 --> 01:38:45,447
- Can you help us?
- Sure.

717
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,500
-- English --
