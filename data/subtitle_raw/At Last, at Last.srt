1
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,219
THE VIRGIN WIFE

2
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,044
He fell...

3
00:01:22,686 --> 00:01:24,530
It's the first time I've seen an Italian.

4
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,582
And you?

5
00:01:25,634 --> 00:01:27,618
I want to go to bed with him.

6
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:33,140
Of course it's well known.
Italians are the best in the world.

7
00:01:33,278 --> 00:01:36,033
Yes, a true Latin lover,
but I think he's with his wife.

8
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,964
So what?  I still want to do it.

9
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:40,343
- What nerve!
- Why are you so angry?

10
00:01:40,386 --> 00:01:43,408
Those French girls.
Talking about you!

11
00:01:43,445 --> 00:01:45,929
- Oh, and...?
- How can they know?

12
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:49,476
They don't know what
you lack as a the Latin lover.

13
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:53,864
What do you mean, Valentina?
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

14
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:57,084
Easy for you to say!
You've yet to show me your skills.

15
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:39,718
Over here, Valentina!

16
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,706
- Hi, Mama!
- Hi...

17
00:02:45,757 --> 00:02:50,447
You look exhausted, darling!
The honeymoon must have been something ...

18
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:55,120
- Yes, I'm tired... from the trip and all...
- You can tell me, I'm your mother.

19
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:58,110
Come here and give me a kiss.

20
00:02:58,869 --> 00:03:03,041
- What's this?  It looks like you're wasting away.
- Honestly, I never felt better.

21
00:03:03,048 --> 00:03:06,246
My daughter has worn you out...

22
00:03:06,261 --> 00:03:09,103
- I, uh...
- Let's go!

23
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:13,553
It was non-stop, mama.
Go here, go there, come on...

24
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:18,750
- All over Italy... !
- Bravo Giovannino...  my daughter is safely home!

25
00:03:18,785 --> 00:03:22,883
Why didn't Uncle Frederico
come to pick us up, mama?

26
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:27,867
He's over at the factory, looking
after his customers.  He works all the time.

27
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,440
Come on Matilda, roll over
and I'll give it to you again!

28
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,879
- Damn it to hell ...
- Why are you swearing?

29
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,826
- No... the children are back! It's already 4 o'clock.
- What children are you talking about?

30
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:43,781
Who?  My nephew Giovannino and his
Valentina are back from their honeymoon.

31
00:03:44,415 --> 00:03:49,163
I promised I'd pick them up at the pier.
The boat arrived at 3 o'clock.

32
00:03:49,975 --> 00:03:52,381
- Ciao, baby.  You were great.
- Ciao !

33
00:04:06,142 --> 00:04:11,794
Home at last.
This fresh air is so invigorating!

34
00:04:11,883 --> 00:04:15,439
- How lovely!
- It's Murano, do you like it?

35
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:20,922
Well, this fresh air here
will sure be good... for my lungs.

36
00:04:20,948 --> 00:04:24,242
Sure, good for your lungs...

37
00:04:24,825 --> 00:04:30,095
Rome and Naples may be beautiful,
but there's nothing like our lake.

38
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:34,621
Like they say, every bird prefers its own nest.

39
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:40,126
Look here...  Mama Lucia
bought you new bedding.

40
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:44,633
- Have you see this, Valentina?
- Yes, the blanket is perfect.  Thanks, Mama!

41
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,743
You're a wonderful mother!

42
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:53,190
- Look!  My mother's picture.
- Oh, yes?

43
00:04:54,056 --> 00:04:58,723
It was Mr. Frederico's idea.
Look at the beautiful frame; it's silver.

44
00:05:01,745 --> 00:05:05,837
Where are the wanderers?
My treasures...

45
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:09,445
- Hello, Uncle!
- Valentina...

46
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:13,484
Giovannino!  Mrs. Lucia... !

47
00:05:13,733 --> 00:05:17,183
Mama Lucia told us that
you've been working like a madman.

48
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:20,574
What can I say?  The work has to get done.
You're the one who's had an exciting time.

49
00:05:20,631 --> 00:05:23,111
- So tell me.. was everything perfect?
- Pretty much...

50
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:26,047
- It was so so, Uncle.
- What happened?

51
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:31,098
Hey... you seem a little depressed...

52
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:36,826
No, they're just tired, Frederico.
Up, down...  You get the idea?

53
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:41,839
I understand!
On top, that's the best...

54
00:05:41,867 --> 00:05:45,517
So everything is okay.  Gabriela, bring
us a bottle of that 60 year-old brandy.

55
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,635
- As you wish...
- Why brandy... ?

56
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:51,253
That's so old-fashioned, Uncle.

57
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:54,959
Today everyone uses drugs,
and you still believe in this stuff?

58
00:05:55,441 --> 00:06:00,659
Listen to your Uncle!   Drink a glass
of brandy and you'll see what it does...

59
00:06:00,724 --> 00:06:05,785
Are you sure?

60
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:19,995
- What a beautiful gown... !
- It's not too transparent?

61
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:24,199
I can see everything...

62
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,304
- It's beautiful.  Where did you get it?
- It's a gift from mama.

63
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:36,146
She made it with her own hands.
From all natural materials.

64
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:40,092
See how silky it feels!

65
00:06:40,164 --> 00:06:44,437
Yes, it is silky and slippery...

66
00:06:46,033 --> 00:06:51,987
It slides through my fingers.
It's wonderful.  Your mother made this?

67
00:06:52,085 --> 00:06:57,996
Yes, both the inside and outside.
Why are you waiting to take what's inside?

68
00:06:59,413 --> 00:07:04,905
- Reach inside and take them both.
- Yes...

69
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:10,654
- I want you, Valentina!
- Then turn out the light and take me.

70
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:15,792
- Why do you care about the light?
- Just turn off the lights, Giovannino!

71
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,478
Damn...

72
00:07:20,793 --> 00:07:23,959
- My love...
- The other one...

73
00:07:23,994 --> 00:07:27,763
What's with the lights?
You'll make me lose my mind.

74
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:31,371
Please turn it out!

75
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:34,886
Yes!
Damn...

76
00:07:35,091 --> 00:07:41,186
- My love...
- It seems like the nightgown excites you...

77
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:45,099
You certainly know me, Valentina.
Playing games in bed is so exciting.

78
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:47,848
- Then take a shot at the goal, baby!
- I'm getting into position ...

79
00:07:47,921 --> 00:07:53,153
- Come on, score...
- Tonight I will be victorious!

80
00:07:53,245 --> 00:07:56,580
- Okay, Giovanni!  Give it to her!
- Remove my nightgown!

81
00:07:56,784 --> 00:08:00,114
Not now, it will spoil the moment.
Apparently it helps me.

82
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:04,198
- Then I'll take it off ...
- No ...

83
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:11,639
You're like the Eiffel Tower...
Faster, Giovanni...

84
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:17,014
It's so good, Giovanni...
Don't stop now...

85
00:08:20,023 --> 00:08:24,872
Giovanni...

86
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,338
Giovanni !?

87
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:32,140
- I'll be damned...
- Not again?

88
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:37,674
Damn it too hell!  It's not possible...
I just can't understand it.

89
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:50,768
- It doesn't matter.  I enjoyed it.
- What shall we do, Valentina?

90
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:55,281
I think it's the position
that's the most important.

91
00:08:56,072 --> 00:08:59,090
How do you know that?

92
00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:04,043
I've seen articles in
magazines and newspapers...

93
00:09:06,752 --> 00:09:09,815
- What are you doing, removing your nightgown?
- Yes.

94
00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:14,072
No... just pull it up...

95
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:25,252
I fell out of bed.
Here, let me pick you up.

96
00:09:26,157 --> 00:09:30,841
Let's see how this works...

97
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:39,734
- That didn't go very well...
- Are you uncomfortable?

98
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,288
- Ow!
- Did I hurt you?

99
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:23,032
What's that?

100
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,516
A shoe.

101
00:10:28,537 --> 00:10:31,749
Do you think we should try another position?

102
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:34,851
If it was up to me, we might as
well try it upside down in the window.

103
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:39,496
It's not a problem of position,
I need some kind of miracle, I tell you ...

104
00:10:40,664 --> 00:10:45,554
- So you can't even do it in our own home?
- I'm sorry, Valentina!

105
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:50,336
I think it was a mistake to try.
Maybe I'm just tired from our trip.

106
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:56,652
You'll see, after a good night's
sleep, things will be better tomorrow.

107
00:11:00,636 --> 00:11:05,174
- I have to go... take care of this.
- As you wish, my lady.

108
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:14,304
Listen, Valentina, before you deal
with this situation, I want to be sure.

109
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,008
Stop it, mama!

110
00:11:16,017 --> 00:11:21,265
You've done everything for Giovannino?
Everything I told you... from A to Z?

111
00:11:22,051 --> 00:11:27,438
Everything, mama.  Everything!  I've done
everything possible, as well as the impossible.

112
00:11:28,382 --> 00:11:33,426
By the Virgin, look what can happen to a person.

113
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:38,180
What a fool!  He does nothing?
He doesn't say a word?

114
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:40,347
He says good night!

115
00:11:40,381 --> 00:11:45,310
This won't be easy.  I'm going
to talk to his uncle, Frederico.

116
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:49,227
No, Mama!  What does it have to do
with Uncle Frederico?  I'm too ashamed!

117
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:52,337
Are you crazy?
It's he who should be ashamed!

118
00:11:52,551 --> 00:11:55,303
He may have money,
but he's still a common slob.

119
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:58,310
I'll organize them later.

120
00:11:59,262 --> 00:12:02,235
I may be overly sensitive, but I get
a bit nervous when I see the bottom.

121
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:05,470
Don't worry, Mr. Frederico,
I won't leave you to stack all these boxes.

122
00:12:05,505 --> 00:12:08,830
What boxes?  Come on down, Camilla!
Give me your hand!  Come!

123
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,150
I'll pay you overtime...

124
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:15,843
Actually, I'll buy you a whole wardrobe...

125
00:12:15,906 --> 00:12:20,882
- I'm afraid, Mr. Frederico.  I'm too young.
- I can wait!  How about another five minutes?

126
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:27,334
- Hey!  You have nothing on underneath.
- Of course!  Can't you see that I'm hot!?

127
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,165
You're telling me!  I feel like I'm on fire.
Like the Olympic flame ...

128
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,762
What are you doing with
your hands, Mr. Frederico ... !

129
00:12:42,663 --> 00:12:43,963
My God...

130
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:46,943
- Is it your father?
- No, Mr. Frederico.  It's Mrs. Lucia.

131
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:49,041
- Mr. Frederico!
- That bitch...

132
00:12:50,816 --> 00:12:53,388
- Frederico... I'm a bit angry!
- Well, that's that...

133
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:56,896
What are you doing naked?
Cover yourself up!

134
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,061
What is it, Mrs. Lucia?

135
00:13:00,093 --> 00:13:04,045
A pair of snakes has nothing on your nephew.
Did you knew that Valentina is still intact?

136
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,247
You know why?
Because Giovannino is impotent.

137
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:12,990
Gabriela!  I want the truth.

138
00:13:13,054 --> 00:13:17,972
What did Giovannino do when he came
into your room before he got married?

139
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:23,359
- What do you think?  He did what he wanted to...
- Yes, but did he do it normally?

140
00:13:23,397 --> 00:13:25,117
What do you mean by normally?

141
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:28,018
Normally?  He pushed it in, pulled it out.
Was his pistol hard?

142
00:13:28,043 --> 00:13:30,060
Hard in the sense of being violent?

143
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:33,064
No.  I mean, was his pistol... ?

144
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:37,088
Yes, it was normal.
But nothing like yours, Mr. Frederico.

145
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,040
You can't compare anyone to me.
I am a special case, suffice it to say...

146
00:13:43,484 --> 00:13:46,540
What could have happened?
He was properly trained as a child.

147
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:50,541
He excelled at all sports.
So why is he like this now?

148
00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:53,065
Why, what has happened?

149
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:57,181
What has happened is that he
has yet to use his pistol on his wife.

150
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:00,980
What a pity!  And now?

151
00:14:01,037 --> 00:14:05,668
Instead of sitting on the sidelines, you
must get involved, since this is your domain.

152
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:08,742
- What can I do?
- You need to help him raise his flag.

153
00:14:08,827 --> 00:14:11,551
He must have the strength
to get his jet off the runway.

154
00:14:11,617 --> 00:14:14,703
And if Ms. Valentina
finds out, what do I say?

155
00:14:14,775 --> 00:14:18,043
That's a problem,
what to tell Ms. Valentina...

156
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:23,547
But what can we do, cry in our milk?  Giovannino
must have a crotch pistol instead of chewing gum!

157
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:29,965
Valentina should hold her tongue, until
you've helped Giovannino overcome his problem.

158
00:14:30,939 --> 00:14:39,693
Tonight, when Mrs. Valentina is taking
her bath, you'll be taking Giovannino.

159
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,011
Now, let me take a
moment to do an inventory...

160
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:49,050
When you see the takeoff angle has
reached 100 degrees, he's ready to fly.

161
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:56,832
And before dinner, be sure to spice
up the soup with pepper from Calabria.

162
00:14:56,892 --> 00:14:59,687
Pepper, not soft butter...

163
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:05,591
Gabriela, you forgot to
add some soup to the pepper...

164
00:15:05,658 --> 00:15:07,679
Why, is it too hot?

165
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,017
No, it's just like "The Towering
Inferno" with Paul Newman.

166
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:16,240
I'm sorry sir, it's a new kind of
pepper, and I didn't know how to use it...

167
00:15:16,352 --> 00:15:19,370
...and Mr. Frederico likes things spicy.

168
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:23,835
That was more like a
flamethrower than pepper.

169
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:35,408
I hate this program.  I'm going
to bed to read "Lady Chatterley".

170
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:41,810
- I'll be up as soon as I finish this cigarette.
- That's good, Giovannino!

171
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:46,834
- Good night, Uncle Frederico!
- Good night, Valentina!

172
00:15:51,603 --> 00:15:55,468
I don't really like this program either.
I think I'll go out for a walk.

173
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,711
- Good night, Giovannino!
- Good night, Uncle!

174
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:03,322
- Good night, Mr. Frederico!
- Good night, Gabriela!

175
00:16:22,423 --> 00:16:27,747
Excuse me!

176
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:34,244
The attacking forces begin
their offensive from the sky.

177
00:16:34,538 --> 00:16:37,997
Throwing a wall of
steel ahead of the advance.

178
00:16:38,116 --> 00:16:42,818
The first blows fall in the
surrounding area.  The enemy senses danger...

179
00:16:42,871 --> 00:16:47,071
...while below the means of defense
begin to weaken under the blows.

180
00:16:47,108 --> 00:16:52,273
The enemy futiley tries to repulse the
attack that is battering it, and hold its lines.

181
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,641
The artillery opens a violent bombardment.
The defending forces seem to give up.

182
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:07,537
There is a predetermined strategy.  Covered
by air support, the infantry advances in safely.

183
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:11,294
First infiltrating and then advancing.

184
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,409
While the enemy seems distracted,
predetermined targets are subjected to attack.

185
00:17:19,645 --> 00:17:23,433
The infiltration continues its
steady advance and is unstoppable.

186
00:17:24,154 --> 00:17:27,206
The enemy remains under cover and
tries to resist from his defensive position...

187
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:32,216
...hoping to attempt a counter-offensive.

188
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:42,411
Finally, the infantry leaves its
defensive position and mounts an attack...

189
00:17:42,498 --> 00:17:45,912
What are you doing, Mr. Giovannino?  Why
are you touching me?  What are you thinking?

190
00:17:46,001 --> 00:17:51,380
- I'll tear your panties off...
- Yes, Mr. Giovannino, just like old times...

191
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:55,491
You're so rough...
What if your wife comes...

192
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:59,141
Come here...
The bells have started to ring...

193
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:02,290
Stop it!

194
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:05,299
- Gabriela!
- Mr. Frederico!

195
00:18:05,331 --> 00:18:08,622
Damn, that wasn't pepper.
That was a napalm bomb.

196
00:18:08,651 --> 00:18:11,717
It feels like a fire in my stomach.
Bring me a lemonade, Gabriela.

197
00:18:11,787 --> 00:18:14,871
Immediately, Mr. Frederico.

198
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:18,010
I'll be off to bed, Uncle.
Good night!

199
00:18:18,022 --> 00:18:22,608
Bravo!  That's a good idea.
Go quickly... you'd better hurry.

200
00:18:22,651 --> 00:18:27,587
Valentina!  Where are you?

201
00:18:27,587 --> 00:18:30,989
- I'm in the bathroom, just a moment!
- Open the door!

202
00:18:31,021 --> 00:18:35,200
Holy Ambrosia, you've lent a hand!
With respect, I give thanks for that!

203
00:18:35,366 --> 00:18:40,249
Please come out Valentina, I'm in the mood...
Open up!

204
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,561
You only feel like it
when I'm in the bathroom?

205
00:18:43,596 --> 00:18:46,726
I've never tried that, but
I swear to you that I am ready!

206
00:18:46,768 --> 00:18:49,077
You're a liar, I don't believe it.

207
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:54,158
No!  Please don't talk like that!

208
00:18:54,222 --> 00:18:58,249
Valentina, something's happening down there...

209
00:18:58,306 --> 00:19:01,469
- What is it?
- If I fail, you can shoot me.

210
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:04,365
Let's hurry!

211
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:08,960
- Come see what you've done to me...
- This is dangerous, you should be in bed.

212
00:19:09,043 --> 00:19:12,097
Beds are for the sick.
I'm as healthy as a horse...

213
00:19:12,677 --> 00:19:15,683
...in a house where people
spend half their day having sex.

214
00:19:15,727 --> 00:19:19,127
Come here!
Let me make a deposit in your bank...

215
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:25,045
- Did you pull a muscle?
- No... a fork has pierced my snake.

216
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:37,094
- You're acting so rough...
- Valentina!  I ...

217
00:19:38,149 --> 00:19:42,111
- It feels like the end of the world!
- But I feel better...

218
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:49,805
How beautiful!  Once the gates
were opened, they unleashed the storm...

219
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,092
I felt like a human flamethrower, but now...

220
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:59,380
- But now the flame has gone out.
- It's not my fault that you broke the bed.

221
00:19:59,466 --> 00:20:02,525
- I'm ready, and you sit in the bathroom ...
- I'm always ready.

222
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,893
Why don't you read "Lady Chatterley"?
You might learn something.

223
00:20:05,921 --> 00:20:08,992
What does "Lady Chatterley"
have to do with it?

224
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:12,468
- Go see Mrs. Valentina.
- Surely Mrs. Valentina wants some privacy?

225
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,475
What do you know?  Go make the bed.
Tonight we had some bad luck ...

226
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:27,571
Look what's happened to me... !
Sitting here with a wounded snake.

227
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,268
We're going to lunch, Mrs. Valentina.
Shall I close up since everyone is leaving?

228
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:36,111
- No, Tania's husband comes for her.
- Do you know when Mrs. Lucia is returning?

229
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:40,443
- She went to Brescia to close a contract.
- Then I'll say goodbye and bon appetite!

230
00:20:40,498 --> 00:20:42,957
- Thank you...
- Let's go, girls.

231
00:20:44,231 --> 00:20:47,382
What an honor, Mrs. Valentina!

232
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:51,976
- You can go to mass while you're out, girls.
- Thank you, Mrs. Valentina!

233
00:20:52,615 --> 00:20:57,006
I understand your mother
is out of town, Mrs. Valentina?

234
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,131
Mother went to Brescia and
will be gone the rest of the day.

235
00:21:01,138 --> 00:21:05,036
I didn't come to see your mother.  It is
you who warms my heart, Mrs. Valentina!

236
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:08,129
Can I help you with something?

237
00:21:08,193 --> 00:21:12,661
You already have.  But excuse my
impudence, I continue to live in hope.

238
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:15,519
- Please... Mr. Lawyer!
- There's no cause for worry...

239
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,058
My veneration of you
remains discrete and respectful.

240
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:22,603
What do you want?

241
00:21:22,603 --> 00:21:27,094
I came to pick up some documents
concerning my client's bankruptcy.

242
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:31,791
They should be an
envelope for me in your office.

243
00:21:40,027 --> 00:21:43,659
- Is this it?
- What beautiful hair you have, Mrs. Valentina...

244
00:21:43,751 --> 00:21:46,807
- ... soft and sensual ...
- Get out of here, Mr. Lawyer.

245
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:50,988
- There's nothing wrong with this, Mrs. Valentina.
- My name is Mrs. Arrighini.

246
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:54,826
- There's nothing wrong with this, Mrs. Arrighini.
- Take your hands off me!

247
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:59,039
What are you doing with my clothes?

248
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:04,043
- I've loved you all my life.
- You make me sick.

249
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,920
Don't struggle so...
This is quite normal...

250
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:11,143
Valentina!

251
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:16,930
I'm in here Giovannino.  I had to get
some documents for Lawyer Caldura.

252
00:22:17,571 --> 00:22:20,593
Good afternoon, Mr. Arrighini.
How is your uncle?

253
00:22:20,688 --> 00:22:24,388
My uncle is fine.  May I ask
how you are doing, Mr. Lawyer?

254
00:22:25,204 --> 00:22:28,227
Pretty well, thanks!

255
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:34,893
I'll take these documents, and
get the rest from your mother.

256
00:22:34,963 --> 00:22:39,443
- Good day... !
- Goodbye!

257
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:43,142
If I see that slimey lawyer's
face again,  I'll break his nose.

258
00:22:43,641 --> 00:22:45,759
- Why, what did he do?
- Nothing, but I'll still beat him.

259
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:48,806
If only to have fun.

260
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:52,170
The lawyer is a gentleman, he wouldn't
do anything to hurt me, Giovannino.

261
00:22:52,235 --> 00:22:55,608
I'd like to see that toad with a girl of his own.

262
00:22:58,027 --> 00:23:02,997
Listen, Valentina!  I've gone
a little overboard about all this.

263
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:08,116
I'm normally not like this.
This isn't like me.

264
00:23:08,199 --> 00:23:12,279
Give me a moment!
You see how I got...

265
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,316
I became enflamed...

266
00:23:16,345 --> 00:23:23,091
Sometimes I react to you like someone who
had a set of balls instead of a limp snake and...

267
00:23:23,685 --> 00:23:26,715
But I swear, that's how
I feel and the rest be damned.

268
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:29,697
I don't know.  Maybe its some
kind of complex, like Freud says.

269
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,459
Or I might need a technician,
or  a doctor, or a plumber.

270
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:39,684
- But I do love you...
- You know that you love me.

271
00:23:42,578 --> 00:23:47,317
I know, baby.

272
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,509
And I love you.
I adore you!

273
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:57,521
Don't let some buffoon ruin everything.

274
00:23:58,125 --> 00:24:04,053
Then I promise I'll succeed...
Come here!

275
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:12,381
I'll make you forget that lawyer.

276
00:24:12,399 --> 00:24:16,254
- What lawyer?  I want you.
- And I want you...

277
00:24:40,542 --> 00:24:45,018
But you promised, Giovannino...

278
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:50,147
Giovannino!  Darling!

279
00:24:50,377 --> 00:24:53,759
I blew it again.

280
00:24:53,835 --> 00:24:57,340
Why am I cursed?
What kind of life is this?

281
00:24:57,421 --> 00:25:00,705
- This is affliction is destroying me!
- Where you going, Giovannino?

282
00:25:00,944 --> 00:25:04,807
Where should I go?  Onto the terrace,
into the garden?  I'm going to hell.

283
00:25:11,985 --> 00:25:16,522
The fact is I have no more cases today...

284
00:25:28,395 --> 00:25:31,661
It's so hot!
Tell me, where can we cool off?

285
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:34,917
Let's go to the bar.

286
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:39,520
Look here...
Hello!

287
00:25:39,922 --> 00:25:42,927
Mrs. Lucia, Mrs. Valentina!
May we have the honor?

288
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:48,265
- Thanks, but I'm thirsty!
- Giovannino ... !

289
00:25:50,244 --> 00:25:54,254
You two may do as you please...

290
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:58,900
- Excuse us, Mr. Lawyer!
- My pleasure, Mrs. Lucia!

291
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:12,380
I heard a rumor that you were
pursuing some young married woman.

292
00:26:12,422 --> 00:26:16,617
I can tell when you're being diplomatic.
I would never do such a terrible thing.

293
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:19,498
So what have you been doing?

294
00:26:19,498 --> 00:26:24,216
What I've done isn't important.  What is
important is what people think I've done.

295
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:30,210
I know the truth.  Giovannino is the
one to watch out for here in the village.

296
00:26:30,716 --> 00:26:32,894
Is that true?

297
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:38,311
His nephew's wife, Valentina, is quite...
Do you follow me, Lawyer Caldura?

298
00:26:38,477 --> 00:26:41,941
Look how he fathered all
those bastards in southern towns.

299
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:45,439
And I can tell you those rumors are no joke.

300
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:53,614
If they are true, no one could
blame Mrs. Valentina if tomorrow...

301
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:59,797
...or the day after tomorrow, would leave
her husband to seek happiness... elsewhere.

302
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:30,807
What's this...

303
00:28:37,325 --> 00:28:39,041
Bravo, Uncle!

304
00:28:40,288 --> 00:28:44,581
- In the morning she practices her gymnastics.
- Yes, yes!

305
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,995
It perks me up, too...

306
00:28:49,031 --> 00:28:52,116
I've got to be off to the factory.
See you later.

307
00:28:52,203 --> 00:28:55,876
- Yes, Uncle.
- Ciao! Be good.

308
00:29:16,225 --> 00:29:18,993
- Who is it?
- Alain Delon!

309
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:22,701
I prefer you, Frederico!
To what do I owe the pleasure?

310
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:27,715
- Is there something you want?
- I'd like to give you a trim.

311
00:29:28,327 --> 00:29:30,697
- Look here!  Property of Moulin Rouge.
- What's that?

312
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:33,122
- My Red Mill in Paris!
- I understand.

313
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:36,996
But it's ten in the
morning and the Mill is closed.

314
00:29:37,019 --> 00:29:40,083
We need a non-stop
program in heavy industry.

315
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:44,206
I want to go into your oven...

316
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:49,254
- You're in rare form this morning...
- I can't even think.

317
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:53,900
- That moron of a nephew Giovannino...
- By the way, people are saying that he...

318
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:57,816
I know what they say!
His wife has aviation gas for blood.

319
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,854
A woman who could set fire to
the city of Brianza while the idiot stands...

320
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:04,000
...with his dick in his hand instead of...

321
00:30:04,076 --> 00:30:08,087
Perhaps I'm wrong, but you might do well
to teach your little nephew some working skills...

322
00:30:08,114 --> 00:30:10,703
And the first would be learning to drill!

323
00:30:14,504 --> 00:30:19,711
Bull hormones are infallible.  Your
problem will be solved in less than 48 hours.

324
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:26,061
- Unless...
- Unless what?

325
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:32,343
Unless it's something else.
Sit down...

326
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,026
- What illnesses did you have when you were little?
- I don't remember.

327
00:30:37,125 --> 00:30:40,558
I'll check you record.
So...

328
00:30:41,777 --> 00:30:47,703
At seven you had broken a leg.
At 12 you fell from a tree.

329
00:30:47,805 --> 00:30:50,345
At 15 you got hit in the head with a stone...

330
00:30:50,372 --> 00:30:54,769
I know Doc, but you
must admit, I was a bit lucky.

331
00:30:54,941 --> 00:30:59,572
You're right.  It could have been worse.
Let's take a look at your chest.

332
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:05,049
Lie back!
Usually, the problem is internal.

333
00:31:06,967 --> 00:31:10,488
Sit up!

334
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,797
Take a breath.

335
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:19,598
How does that feel?

336
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:23,730
- I feel a sensation of heat.
- Impossible!  What heat?

337
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:27,513
It's just what I feel, and it's getting stronger.

338
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:32,040
Let me guess.
You're no longer feeling it now?

339
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:37,123
- You're right!  I don't feel it.
- You're healthy as a horse.

340
00:31:37,788 --> 00:31:41,063
That's how it is!  Although being
a horse may not be healthy for me.

341
00:31:41,321 --> 00:31:44,846
Give it time, we've just got started.

342
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:47,652
- Giovannino Arrighini!
- Present.

343
00:31:48,192 --> 00:31:52,029
Come over here!
Tell me something!

344
00:31:54,371 --> 00:32:00,513
These pictures of muscle men...
how do they effect you?

345
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:05,113
- They disgust me, Doc.
- You are saved!

346
00:32:05,296 --> 00:32:08,408
Come on Camilla, don't tease me.

347
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:12,534
I helped your father, I helped this
Christian democracy ... what are you afraid of?

348
00:32:12,611 --> 00:32:18,038
If the communists return they'll
subvert the workers, Don Emilio says.

349
00:32:18,245 --> 00:32:21,693
What of the workers?
I'm a friend of labor, I've trained them.

350
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,830
- You are so fresh and beautiful...
- Mr. Frederico!

351
00:32:24,889 --> 00:32:27,919
What is this,
some kind of emergency?

352
00:32:28,201 --> 00:32:33,245
It's getting so you
can't talk politics any more...

353
00:32:34,158 --> 00:32:37,297
- Where you are, Mr. Frederico?
- In the shit.

354
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,091
- Sorry!
- So what's the crisis?

355
00:32:40,168 --> 00:32:42,536
It's a telegram from Mr. Gianfranco.

356
00:32:42,629 --> 00:32:47,315
That's nice.  You made it sound like
there was an earthquake.  I'm coming.

357
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:52,933
- What did he say?
- He's coming this morning with his governess.

358
00:32:52,938 --> 00:32:57,924
- The Lady Cartofen...
- Mrs. Valentina already opened it.

359
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,652
Perfect!  Prepare a royal
lunch and the guest bedroom.

360
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:09,060
- Of course.
- Why not take Camilla to the house?

361
00:33:09,576 --> 00:33:12,226
There will be a lot of people
and you'll need some help.

362
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:16,031
I suspect the kind of work she's cut
out for would help you more than me.

363
00:33:16,431 --> 00:33:18,708
I like to work... not to be worked over.

364
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:24,965
Quickly, put that on the shelf.

365
00:33:25,346 --> 00:33:30,808
Brigitte, this is a Sicilian specialty.
Sort of African-Italian.

366
00:33:31,446 --> 00:33:35,901
- This is a gift from the lawyer Caldura.
- Thank you, Uncle Frederico!

367
00:33:36,827 --> 00:33:40,149
- Care for a bite?
- No.

368
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,437
- These sweet marzipan cakes are aphrodisiacs.
- What are aphrodisiacs?

369
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:50,382
Aphrodisiacs make you crave a good
fleecing every week, then recover for two months.

370
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:57,186
- Gianfranco eats plenty of these when he's here.
- But I'm always a bit skeptical whether...

371
00:33:57,728 --> 00:34:00,921
- Bravo...
- Have a banana.

372
00:34:01,111 --> 00:34:05,353
- Oh!  A banana...
- Brigitte eats a lot of bananas for her health.

373
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:11,931
Then eat all you like.
I've opened a bottle of 60 year old brandy...

374
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:14,166
Here's one for Giovannino.

375
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:21,212
- And one to help you work harder, Mr. Frederico.
- Bravo!

376
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:23,731
I'll show you my latest project later...

377
00:34:26,953 --> 00:34:29,735
This brandy can wake the dead.

378
00:34:30,412 --> 00:34:34,467
Gianfranco doesn't need it, he's always up.

379
00:34:35,601 --> 00:34:39,440
But my nephew and his uncle will benefit...

380
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:42,583
By the way, Giovannino, you must
drink this, and try some of the cakes.

381
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:46,592
- For you, children.
- Thank you, Uncle!

382
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:48,856
You'll be okay, Giovannino.

383
00:34:57,038 --> 00:35:01,619
As the proverb says:
brandy and cakes raise all skirts.

384
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:05,196
I proved it with my Gianfranco.

385
00:35:08,749 --> 00:35:12,107
I tell you, brandy has an explosive effect.

386
00:35:29,402 --> 00:35:34,174
Gianfranco, can you explain to
your wife how to eat that banana?

387
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,470
I know how to eat it, but I like to
have fun before I finish it.  Don't you?

388
00:35:40,486 --> 00:35:44,096
- Isn't that so, Gianfranco?
- Yes, everything she says is true.

389
00:35:44,685 --> 00:35:49,328
And he likes to invent
new games, especially in bed.

390
00:35:49,477 --> 00:35:52,883
That's why I married him.

391
00:35:52,959 --> 00:35:58,934
What is it called in Italian - those
monkeys that make love continuously?

392
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:04,003
- I'll think about it...
- Mandrills!

393
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:07,227
Bravo !  That's it, mandrills.

394
00:36:07,283 --> 00:36:11,512
Gianfranco is a regular mandrill...

395
00:36:11,823 --> 00:36:16,539
I don't know you, but, well...
She doesn't sound like other Germans.

396
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:22,156
Excuse me, I need a little air.
That brandy has my system all worked up.

397
00:36:22,206 --> 00:36:27,661
Giovannino, take this bottle to your room.

398
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:40,297
- Valentina!
- I'm here, Giovannino.

399
00:36:41,604 --> 00:36:46,313
I think my uncle was right, the
cakes and brandy are having an effect.

400
00:36:46,615 --> 00:36:49,675
Can it be true?

401
00:36:49,725 --> 00:36:55,501
What are you doing to me, Gianfranco... ?
Oh, that's wonderful... !

402
00:36:55,698 --> 00:37:00,517
I brought her from Germany to
teach us how to do it for ourselves.

403
00:37:01,042 --> 00:37:07,648
My love... you're the end of the world!
The end of the world...

404
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:12,051
My own Kama Sutra...

405
00:37:14,803 --> 00:37:19,044
Not bad work with the
banana in the other room ...

406
00:37:21,343 --> 00:37:24,570
Of course, not a banana pancake...

407
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:36,197
That must be some interference on their television.
A pair of competitors in the International Games...

408
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,418
Back to our scheduled broadcast.
Where was I?  Yes... my banana!

409
00:37:41,765 --> 00:37:46,354
My lady... !

410
00:37:51,347 --> 00:37:56,976
Oh, my mandrill!  You're so strong!
Harder, harder...

411
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:07,806
- I saw you eat most of the cakes...
- Yes, I did.  You are a big bull and my...

412
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:12,390
- You heard what I said?
- ...you're the greatest...

413
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:17,024
I heard you, but couldn't understand with those
two screaming like they're at the supermarket.

414
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:21,092
Giovannino, why don't we
do some shopping ourselves?

415
00:38:22,087 --> 00:38:27,625
- Good, good ...
- So, now my Chiquitita is speaking German...

416
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:35,200
- It's nice, isn't it?
- It is, but the banana is for dessert!

417
00:38:35,368 --> 00:38:39,503
- So let's start with the appetizer.
- No!  Please, let's start with the main course!

418
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:46,392
...his eel, thick as a sturgeon...

419
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:51,181
... be careful with the fish jokes,
otherwise you'll finish without the caviar...

420
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:57,847
Damn whore!  It's like we're at
the fish store on Monza Way.

421
00:38:59,732 --> 00:39:03,523
Except there are no fish in here.

422
00:39:04,328 --> 00:39:09,882
Oh, my Doberman, you
sex machine, you true Italian!

423
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:15,187
I knew I: cakes and brandy
raises all dresses.  I am a lion!

424
00:39:15,277 --> 00:39:18,842
- You may be a lion, but I'm still a virgin...
- And I'm a Capricorn with a big...

425
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,533
- What are you doing, Mr. Frederico?
- I'm reading your horoscope...

426
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:26,636
Does it say I will be successful in life?

427
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:32,329
To my impoverishment!  My God, you have
a figure!  A coat with two buttons here...

428
00:39:32,342 --> 00:39:37,963
It doesn't feel right.  I'm still not ready.
And I'm still earning minimum wage ...

429
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:42,725
It seems that a roll in the hay
requires union negotiations...

430
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:47,142
I'll ask Mr. Lama to find you
a place on the domestic staff.

431
00:39:48,244 --> 00:39:51,249
Now go to sleep!
Did you think that for a nickel raise...

432
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,950
Please don't be mad at me...

433
00:39:52,436 --> 00:39:55,690
- Where you going?
- To take a walk in the garden.

434
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:58,744
Excuse me, Valentina!

435
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:06,954
What big hands you have, Gianfranco!
I just love your hands ...

436
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:11,248
Caress me, darling... !

437
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:17,307
Oh, yes, yes!
You really understand my body...

438
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:25,032
Oh, take me, take me...
Softly!  Softly!  Yes, yes...

439
00:40:25,574 --> 00:40:31,662
No!  Don't put your hand there...
Not so fast...

440
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:36,915
Yes... a long caress ....

441
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:42,405
- You are all I want ...
- Yes, yes...

442
00:40:42,475 --> 00:40:45,864
- Oh, Gianfranco... !
- Now!

443
00:41:54,023 --> 00:41:56,063
Giovannino...

444
00:42:05,059 --> 00:42:08,044
Giovannino...

445
00:42:11,256 --> 00:42:16,605
Giovannino...

446
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,360
You called me, my love?

447
00:42:24,859 --> 00:42:27,211
Do you need something?

448
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:33,398
No!   I only wanted
to tell you good night.

449
00:42:58,394 --> 00:43:02,295
Gianfranco, do you allow your wife to
hang around with her jewels on display?

450
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:05,638
What can I do?  She's a German woman,
and that's how they are in Germany.

451
00:43:05,716 --> 00:43:08,948
Yes, but they also have the Berlin Wall.

452
00:43:08,978 --> 00:43:12,260
Why should you care?  She enjoys
showing it, and doesn't care who looks.

453
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:16,617
- Would you like some cream?
- Yes, thank you!

454
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,276
You have fantastic skin.
Giovannino is a lucky man!

455
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:37,173
I like how it opens the cells!
Shall I rub some cream on your breasts?

456
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:40,302
I'm pretty good, I learned from Gianfranco.

457
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:43,986
- I can do my own.
- Don't tell me you're embarrassed.

458
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:48,321
- Have courage, don't be ridiculous.
- What if Gianfranco and Giovannino see?

459
00:43:48,352 --> 00:43:51,730
You shouldn't look at the negative
side all the time.  Now turn over...

460
00:44:05,278 --> 00:44:10,078
You know...  men may
get jealous, but they're only men.

461
00:44:14,049 --> 00:44:21,047
You have fantastic skin.  And I like your
breasts - they are a true Italian masterpiece.

462
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:29,162
What a lovely gathering!  One comes to the
lake to meet beautiful sea creatures such as you...

463
00:44:29,491 --> 00:44:33,390
Good afternoon, Mrs. Arrighini!
Stay cool...

464
00:44:33,531 --> 00:44:37,649
Mr. Gianfranco, Mr. Giovannino!
Are you're naked, too?

465
00:44:37,736 --> 00:44:40,265
- Have fun!
- Thanks!

466
00:44:40,267 --> 00:44:43,236
- Someday I'll take that one aside and thrash him.
- Why?  He seems to be friendly... !

467
00:44:43,252 --> 00:44:47,165
Friendly?  He's a horny bull!

468
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,128
- Goodbye!
- See you soon!

469
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:03,899
- How's the water, Gianfranco?
- Warm!

470
00:45:04,345 --> 00:45:09,318
If you want to go nude, we
must leave here.  It's too exposed.

471
00:45:09,483 --> 00:45:12,929
We must choose another area.
I'll untie the lines...

472
00:45:32,368 --> 00:45:34,398
Come up here!

473
00:45:53,864 --> 00:45:59,833
- Ciao!
- Hello, I'm Maurice!  Come over here!

474
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,484
- They're cute!
- Come on back!

475
00:46:03,484 --> 00:46:06,486
Come, our camp is over here!

476
00:46:06,723 --> 00:46:11,943
- What's he saying?
- We've been invited to camp!

477
00:46:12,042 --> 00:46:15,314
Now we're getting together with them?
Should I invite the lawyer Caldura, too?

478
00:46:15,382 --> 00:46:18,612
- Let's get out of here!
- Come on, friends.

479
00:46:18,648 --> 00:46:21,565
- Come here!
- Goodbye!

480
00:46:21,790 --> 00:46:27,981
Come back!

481
00:49:28,028 --> 00:49:30,418
You know that you
are simply phenomenal?

482
00:49:31,545 --> 00:49:34,973
- Where did you learn how to be like this?
- I learned it from Brigitte yesterday.

483
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,517
She does this for
her husband every week.

484
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,239
How you're dressed...

485
00:50:15,688 --> 00:50:17,595
- Hurry, get it off!
- Yes.

486
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:27,712
- You are mine. You are mine...
- And you are mine.

487
00:50:27,959 --> 00:50:30,525
- We give ourselves to each other.
- Take me, Giovannino.

488
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:36,286
- This time...
- How wonderful...

489
00:50:37,287 --> 00:50:38,987
Yes, yes...

490
00:50:40,188 --> 00:50:41,988
Yes, yes...

491
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,844
Nooooo...

492
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:57,221
- No, no...
- Forgive me!

493
00:51:17,989 --> 00:51:23,436
- What is it?  Did Camilla turn you down again?
- Cut it out!  Everything is fine!

494
00:51:23,991 --> 00:51:27,850
It's Giovannino that worries me.  He seems
to be in a coma, like something's missing...

495
00:51:28,655 --> 00:51:31,798
The same problem?  He can't get it up?

496
00:51:32,778 --> 00:51:36,278
Do you know everything?  Who are
you, the newspaper owner's daughter?

497
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:39,098
Everyone in town knows, Frederico!

498
00:51:39,664 --> 00:51:42,328
If even one person could mind his own business...

499
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:45,430
- You know I'd help if I could?
- I know...

500
00:51:45,826 --> 00:51:49,792
Right now I'm so agitated
I can hardly get it up myself...

501
00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:56,087
Love, love, love...

502
00:51:56,288 --> 00:51:58,088
My love!

503
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,632
Every time another game of love ...

504
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:06,339
Every time a new surgery for your patient...

505
00:52:08,264 --> 00:52:12,872
- Yes, my love...
- Oh, my beautiful baby...

506
00:52:13,290 --> 00:52:16,559
Oh, my Carthaginian!  Meow, meow ...

507
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:25,071
I can't stop.
I can't stop!  Yes...

508
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:32,500
I'm about to win the gold medal...

509
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:37,531
My stallion...
My lesbian...

510
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:59,786
Get a grip on yourself, Valentina!
Your expectations will destroy you if...

511
00:53:00,554 --> 00:53:03,125
I was destroyed the day we married, Uncle.

512
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:07,363
- You are right!
- What is happiness, Uncle Frederico?

513
00:53:09,846 --> 00:53:14,391
- I understand you're missing that...
- Anyone can see them!

514
00:53:15,941 --> 00:53:18,368
Some do it too much... others not at all.

515
00:53:21,082 --> 00:53:23,702
They are on fire all the time!

516
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:30,545
I can't bear to listen.
It's the passion... of youth.

517
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:34,420
It's something you wouldn't understand.

518
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,987
No, no!  Believe me, I understand it well.
It's your husband who doesn't understand.

519
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:44,491
How can a woman like you fail?
Two beautiful eyes...

520
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:48,081
Two beautiful...

521
00:53:49,382 --> 00:53:50,982
So beautiful...

522
00:53:51,027 --> 00:53:52,766
Yes, but why tell me?

523
00:53:52,853 --> 00:53:56,680
You have everything it takes to
make one man happy... even two men.

524
00:53:58,564 --> 00:54:01,042
Ten men... a hundred men ...

525
00:54:02,332 --> 00:54:08,649
- How good are you, Uncle...
- Me?  You're the good one... a saint.

526
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:13,958
A saint?  I can't
take it anymore.  I'll go crazy!

527
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:18,572
You're telling me?
Your husband should have his tool cut off.

528
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:22,005
Yes, you're right.

529
00:54:22,085 --> 00:54:25,688
Your arms are so strong, Uncle Frederico...

530
00:54:26,027 --> 00:54:29,132
I take vitamins for my health.
But about you...

531
00:54:29,191 --> 00:54:31,288
You're so soft...

532
00:54:33,913 --> 00:54:37,180
You have muscles of iron,
Uncle Frederico...

533
00:54:38,154 --> 00:54:43,134
- How about we play Little Red Riding Hood?
- And you'll be the big bad wolf and eat me?

534
00:54:43,221 --> 00:54:47,251
- Now I'm going to eat you up!
- Uncle Frederico...

535
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,207
I'll eat you up...

536
00:54:49,478 --> 00:54:52,184
How lovely your skin is!
It feels like velvet.

537
00:54:52,241 --> 00:54:54,284
It feels like velvet...

538
00:54:54,685 --> 00:54:56,685
It feels like velvet...

539
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:00,870
Oh... it is velvet.

540
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:16,580
- Mr. Frederico!
- Yes, Mrs. Lucia!

541
00:55:17,003 --> 00:55:19,159
I must speak with you.  It's urgent.

542
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,631
- It's about those rumors, isn't it?
- Yes, about those rumors.

543
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:26,093
Do we need to talk right
here at factory?  Just a moment!

544
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:28,403
- Go and fill that with oil.
- Very well, Mr. Frederico!

545
00:55:28,439 --> 00:55:30,445
Let's take a walk...

546
00:55:31,215 --> 00:55:33,941
They must cut the rope, Mr. Frederico.
Things can't continue as they are.

547
00:55:34,034 --> 00:55:36,108
I think this marriage must be annulled.

548
00:55:36,602 --> 00:55:41,838
Arrighini won't accept an annulment.  He
doesn't want to turn this tragedy into a scandal.

549
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:45,888
The scandal is yours,
but I've paid for the tragedy.

550
00:55:46,324 --> 00:55:49,808
When you think that I gave the best parties.

551
00:55:49,866 --> 00:55:54,218
The Mayor's son, several professors...
Just to mention a couple...

552
00:55:54,238 --> 00:55:58,472
Those two together don't
add up to a quarter of my nephew.

553
00:55:58,497 --> 00:56:02,302
I forgot the attorney Caldura,
who inherited a fortune...

554
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:05,359
He has the wealth of a prince.
A true aristocrat ...

555
00:56:05,590 --> 00:56:12,142
Listen, Mrs. Lucia!  Giovannino isn't a
prince or a lawyer, but he's an honest man.

556
00:56:12,486 --> 00:56:15,014
Although when he's needed
in bed he's like a dead man?

557
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:21,266
Speak with your nephew, and keep in
mind that girl is like a flower... a real woman.

558
00:56:21,655 --> 00:56:27,374
Yes!  A real woman can make
you lose your head.   Just as you said...

559
00:56:27,395 --> 00:56:29,139
Do you know where he is?

560
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:33,998
Of course, he's staying at my house.
I see him every day...

561
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:41,166
Don't worry, Mrs. Lucia, I'll take care
of Giovannino, even if it costs me a fortune.

562
00:56:41,214 --> 00:56:45,623
- I'll send him to Dr. Barnard.
- Why do that?  He's a heart doctor.

563
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:48,535
He's a magician.
He can treat the male organ.

564
00:56:48,623 --> 00:56:50,832
Let's move on, Mrs. Lucia.

565
00:57:05,784 --> 00:57:10,557
This may upset you, and I repeat, the mafia
doesn't exist.  But if it does, it has long hands.

566
00:57:10,646 --> 00:57:14,672
There's no need to worry,
the Tribunal president is my friend.

567
00:57:14,735 --> 00:57:18,136
Excuse me, I have urgent business!

568
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:36,344
- I need to speak with you, Mrs. Valentina.
- You're such a pest!

569
00:57:36,391 --> 00:57:40,064
I know that I'm a pest, but
I followed you with great discretion.

570
00:57:40,085 --> 00:57:44,355
- You have behaved quite badly.
- I need to talk to you.  Give me an hour.

571
00:57:44,371 --> 00:57:49,092
- You exaggerate, Lawyer Caldura.
- My exaggeration reflects the importance of the case.

572
00:57:49,888 --> 00:57:56,843
- Please, Mrs. Valentina!  I beg you!
- Very well, I'll give you half an hour.

573
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:01,490
Half an hour?
Alright. Climb in, Mrs. Valentina!

574
00:58:02,574 --> 00:58:04,970
Quickly... get in!

575
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:07,186
Please, over here!

576
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:12,749
Watch out for the door!

577
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:18,381
So, let's go...

578
00:58:25,947 --> 00:58:27,747
Why did you bring me here?

579
00:58:27,818 --> 00:58:32,324
I thought getting out in a natural
setting may help us, Mrs. Valentina.

580
00:58:34,989 --> 00:58:42,454
The trees, the lake... walking paths and a
gentle breeze.  Who could ask for anything more?

581
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:44,276
At least that is my hope.

582
00:58:44,277 --> 00:58:46,477
I don't believe you... and never expect to.

583
00:58:46,578 --> 00:58:49,175
I'd be lying to say I
hadn't planned on deceiving you.

584
00:58:49,376 --> 00:58:52,276
And you delude yourself in thinking
your continued insistance will work.

585
00:58:52,443 --> 00:58:56,121
I'm not delusional!
All of life is an illusion.

586
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:02,813
- What... ?
- It's a more intimate this way...

587
00:59:02,959 --> 00:59:07,582
- I love you, Mrs. Valentina.  I love you...
- Please, Mr. Lawyer... !

588
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:10,018
I can't resist you, Mrs. Valentina...

589
00:59:11,019 --> 00:59:13,019
- I want to leave...
- Where do you want to go?

590
00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:15,855
- Don't touch me!
- How can I not touch you... ?

591
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:18,015
That is why I brought you here!

592
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:20,339
Don't touch me, or I'll scream!

593
00:59:23,415 --> 00:59:27,251
Why are you so cynical and cruel?
I thought it was finally time...

594
00:59:27,297 --> 00:59:29,812
You were wrong to think so, Mr. Lawyer.

595
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:37,410
- I see no one around, Mrs. Valentina.
- Then I'll get out of the car.

596
00:59:37,528 --> 00:59:39,849
No, wait!  We'll go...

597
00:59:39,989 --> 00:59:46,559
We'll go, my friend!
Lawyer Caldura is a gentleman!

598
00:59:47,986 --> 00:59:51,770
A gentleman discarded... and dying in despair.

599
00:59:55,819 --> 01:00:00,259
The sun!  Smell the country
air, feel the gentle breeze.

600
01:00:01,246 --> 01:00:06,658
This was a good idea. I can feel all
my stress relieved by this peace and quiet.

601
01:00:06,658 --> 01:00:11,810
That makes me happy.  I thought
that getting out in nature would help.

602
01:00:11,885 --> 01:00:15,286
It's true.  I feel refreshed.
I feel like a new man.

603
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:28,112
Birds in the air, dew on the grass...

604
01:00:28,182 --> 01:00:31,351
- Bees buzzing...
- A bee!?

605
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:34,022
Don't worry about the bees.
They've behaved themselves so far...

606
01:00:36,187 --> 01:00:41,927
- You're sweet as honey...
- Kiss me, Giovannino!

607
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,193
Lie down...

608
01:00:58,117 --> 01:01:00,361
This time...

609
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,928
I feel like a sinful Adam in an earthly paradise.

610
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:15,644
And I feel like the virgin Eve.

611
01:01:16,019 --> 01:01:18,249
- Give me the apple, Eve!
- Yes...

612
01:01:26,028 --> 01:01:29,931
Since we're playing Adam
and Eve, we had to have an apple.

613
01:01:30,028 --> 01:01:32,997
- Naturally...
- So, are we going to commit this sin?

614
01:01:45,211 --> 01:01:47,512
- Giovannino!
- What?

615
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:50,211
Look there!  A serpent!

616
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:56,650
Of course, we were Adam and Eve with their
apple.  All that was missing was the serpent.

617
01:02:23,273 --> 01:02:25,208
Your German woman sings beautifully!

618
01:02:25,622 --> 01:02:28,592
Yes, she took lessons from
Patty Brau, particularly the lyrics.

619
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:30,950
I don't understand anything she's saying.

620
01:02:31,158 --> 01:02:34,649
- Who... your wife?
- No, Patty Brau!

621
01:02:56,854 --> 01:03:00,454
I'm finished, Mr. Gianfranco.

622
01:03:02,437 --> 01:03:07,594
Do you know you have a beautiful body?
Perhaps I should examine your eyes.

623
01:03:07,608 --> 01:03:10,668
- They're fine.
- All of you is fine...

624
01:03:11,072 --> 01:03:12,963
I know!
Everyone says that, even your wife.

625
01:03:12,979 --> 01:03:14,443
Yes?

626
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,887
- Don't you know that I'm a virgin, Mr. Gianfranco?
- Well, now I'll just have to take your virginity.

627
01:03:22,232 --> 01:03:26,824
- What if your wife comes down?
- I'll put her on the waiting list.

628
01:03:26,897 --> 01:03:29,546
- I service an international clientele.
- No...

629
01:03:30,666 --> 01:03:32,818
What, right here in the pantry?

630
01:03:38,304 --> 01:03:44,420
Uncle Frederico! I'd have hurried,
if I'd known you were waiting.

631
01:03:44,911 --> 01:03:48,853
Please!  Ladies first.
Especially beautiful ladies.

632
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:53,261
Thank you!  You're very kind.
What's that you're wearing?!

633
01:03:53,811 --> 01:03:57,367
It's Arab sportswear.
From one Arafat to another.

634
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:01,695
Nice melons!  Like we used to say:
you have to squeeze to see if they're ripe!

635
01:04:03,205 --> 01:04:06,390
- Have you seen Gianfranco?
- Gianfranco, he's gone... !

636
01:04:06,892 --> 01:04:11,158
And Camilla and Gabriella!
All gone!  Do you need something?

637
01:04:11,284 --> 01:04:14,942
Gianfranco always gives
me a massage after my bath.

638
01:04:14,953 --> 01:04:18,341
You're in luck!
I once worked in Milan...

639
01:04:18,875 --> 01:04:22,886
...and had a job massaging a German girl.
Then she got a moped and I never saw her again.

640
01:04:23,621 --> 01:04:26,393
- May I give you massage?
- You'd do me?

641
01:04:26,572 --> 01:04:30,458
Come on!

642
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:49,672
- Mamma mia, what a nice tool...
- What did you think, this was Giovannino's dick?

643
01:04:50,193 --> 01:04:53,487
- Wait... I grabbed a salami.
- Okay... we see about that...

644
01:04:59,543 --> 01:05:02,960
...the other players and Beckembauer,
except that he had an injury...

645
01:05:02,961 --> 01:05:05,490
...otherwise he would have been a footballer.

646
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:10,503
Not so hard, Uncle Frederico!
Softly... gently.

647
01:05:10,592 --> 01:05:13,826
- More softly and gently...
- Yes!

648
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:20,637
Yes... that's better.

649
01:05:20,693 --> 01:05:23,299
Good...

650
01:05:26,066 --> 01:05:31,141
- Is it good for you?
- Yes, it's good... so far!

651
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:36,516
The man with the velvet hands!  You
know you feel better than Beckembauer?

652
01:05:36,562 --> 01:05:38,499
Really?

653
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:47,701
What a figure!
Your body looks like a wavy line.

654
01:05:47,817 --> 01:05:50,832
Now a little higher.
Do my breasts, Uncle!

655
01:05:56,085 --> 01:06:03,136
This is more than a massage, Uncle.
I think you intend to mount me!

656
01:06:05,013 --> 01:06:08,269
A joke is a joke,
but when it comes to sex...

657
01:06:08,352 --> 01:06:12,395
...Uncle Frederico skips past the Maginot
Line and cuts through the Iron Curtain.

658
01:06:12,471 --> 01:06:15,568
My torch burns for your body...

659
01:06:15,654 --> 01:06:18,613
Come, girl!  How do
the Arabs do it in these dresses?

660
01:06:29,914 --> 01:06:31,966
What's going on in there?

661
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:41,628
Nothing!   I was just looking for ingredients
to make an omelet.  A French frittata.

662
01:06:41,729 --> 01:06:43,672
What was that, an earthquake?

663
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:45,043
What's going on here?

664
01:06:47,097 --> 01:06:52,044
Mr. Gianfranco wanted to teach
Camilla how to make a French frittata.

665
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:57,808
- That's right.  Not very practical, but...
- But see that you like German frittatas, no?

666
01:07:02,507 --> 01:07:05,448
- You know what I like about you, Gabriella?
- What?

667
01:07:05,449 --> 01:07:11,492
Nothing, absolutely nothing.
Gianfranco, a frittata is just a frittata...

668
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:15,869
The eggs are always found at the bottom!

669
01:07:21,781 --> 01:07:23,835
Even the German got it...

670
01:07:26,491 --> 01:07:33,022
I am sure that after three or four
months at our factory in Germany ...

671
01:07:33,022 --> 01:07:36,480
Moving to a foreign
country can work miracles.

672
01:07:36,519 --> 01:07:39,671
Of course it doesn't mean
exile for the rest of your life.

673
01:07:39,703 --> 01:07:42,728
I think a brief visit should do it.

674
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:47,034
This also concerns Valentina.
She'll remain at home.

675
01:07:47,998 --> 01:07:52,145
You won't miss out anything.  You'll be
in the company of Gianfranco and Brigitte.

676
01:07:56,568 --> 01:08:01,232
They are quite liberal...
Practicing their native tongue.

677
01:08:01,293 --> 01:08:04,808
If I allow my paternal affection...

678
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:09,466
Not really paternal...  but nearly!

679
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:12,859
As I understand it, you want to send
me to a German concentration camp...

680
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:16,164
...because I won't collaborate with the allies.

681
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:19,675
- You're acting like a Nazi, Uncle Frederico.
- Stop talking shit.

682
01:08:19,755 --> 01:08:25,437
- And why do you want me to go alone?
- Valentina can visit when you're restored.

683
01:08:25,495 --> 01:08:28,594
And how will we know when I'm restored?

684
01:08:28,915 --> 01:08:32,498
- When, ah...
- When, ah?  Come on, tell me!

685
01:08:33,027 --> 01:08:36,280
I don't know!  When you've
recovered from your birth defect.

686
01:08:36,281 --> 01:08:38,681
I'll get you some
hormones from a cat in heat.

687
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:42,743
- You got it?
- I'm not moving there... period!

688
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:47,380
This is an issue that only
concerns me and my wife.

689
01:08:47,505 --> 01:08:50,597
And it seems she has decided.

690
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:55,468
On the advice of her mother,
I have no more to say on the matter.

691
01:08:56,043 --> 01:09:01,288
Just when you think you've
seen everything, she takes the prize.

692
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:06,463
I thought I'd married an
understanding, loving girl...

693
01:09:07,112 --> 01:09:12,494
But when we're in bed, her only concern
is whether she's lying next to a bull.

694
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:15,718
Which must mean
that I am married to a cow.

695
01:09:15,783 --> 01:09:20,456
What are you saying, Giovannino?
Do you want to hear the truth?

696
01:09:21,046 --> 01:09:25,362
I gave you love, loyalty, understanding,
affection.  I gave you all I could give.

697
01:09:25,971 --> 01:09:31,700
And when erotic thoughts come to me,
my heart pounds with sexual desire.

698
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:35,919
And if my husband can't perform, what
can I do?  Call Giovannino's cardiologist?

699
01:09:36,308 --> 01:09:39,749
To have him confirm that you're a cow?

700
01:09:39,768 --> 01:09:42,941
Get out of here, you impotent eunuch!

701
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:46,352
I don't want to see you in this house again.

702
01:09:46,441 --> 01:09:52,421
Mother of God, my love is going to
drown herself in the lake.  My poor angel!

703
01:09:53,029 --> 01:09:57,212
What lake, Mama?  You know
where that door goes?  That goes to...

704
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,403
- Valentina!
- My little...

705
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:04,552
Giovannino!  Mrs. Lucia!

706
01:10:04,952 --> 01:10:09,033
You two sit still, don't make a fuss.
Nothing will happen...

707
01:10:09,064 --> 01:10:15,055
- Valentina!  Valentina!
- She's gone to the lake.  A suicide.  I feel it!

708
01:10:29,008 --> 01:10:32,626
Valentina!

709
01:10:35,254 --> 01:10:37,948
- This is terrible...
- Let's split up.

710
01:10:37,953 --> 01:10:40,749
- I'll go this way... you go that way.
- Oh, Mother of God...

711
01:10:40,749 --> 01:10:44,774
Maybe we'd better take the
boat so we can search the bank.

712
01:11:19,671 --> 01:11:23,349
- Lord ... help us find her...
- Pray later.  Now, sit down!

713
01:11:39,345 --> 01:11:43,655
We can't get close enough.  Maybe
it would be better to notify the police.

714
01:11:44,644 --> 01:11:47,449
You're right, Mama.
Let's go back.

715
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,663
- What happened, why did you stop?
- It's out of gas.

716
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:24,761
- Now what?
- I can only paddle.

717
01:12:28,013 --> 01:12:30,045
Put this on, Mama!

718
01:12:36,144 --> 01:12:39,080
I'll be damned, everything happens to me.

719
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:51,625
What are you doing there, sitting on a rock?

720
01:12:57,829 --> 01:12:59,812
Put this on!

721
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:02,789
Come along!

722
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:16,467
Courage Mama, a fishing lodge
is just a hundred meters from here.

723
01:13:17,511 --> 01:13:20,190
We'll shelter there.
Have courage!

724
01:13:23,186 --> 01:13:25,211
Come here.

725
01:13:28,002 --> 01:13:31,072
Hello, won't you please join us, miss!

726
01:13:31,464 --> 01:13:32,972
Go inside!  Please...

727
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:50,680
We made it.
Put the fender over the side!

728
01:13:58,207 --> 01:13:59,996
Let me help you.

729
01:14:01,431 --> 01:14:05,997
Come Mama, stay with me.
Take care, it's slippery.

730
01:14:46,022 --> 01:14:50,076
It will be my fault if
anything happens to Valentina.

731
01:14:51,332 --> 01:14:54,960
Please don't talk like that, Giovannino.

732
01:14:55,038 --> 01:15:01,287
Valentina is no longer a child.  Now get
those clothes off!  You'll catch pneumonia.

733
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:40,713
- Are you tired?
- Yes.

734
01:15:41,092 --> 01:15:44,884
Then why don't you rest?
Here, lie down on the bed.

735
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:54,405
- Would you like a drink?
- Please.

736
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,245
Here!  Drink some whiskey.

737
01:16:21,127 --> 01:16:24,507
Stop, Giovannino.  You mustn't despair.

738
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:29,119
I'm sure nothing will happen to Valentina.

739
01:16:29,206 --> 01:16:32,612
It was just a stupid hysterical crisis.

740
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:39,688
She's a very practical girl, not stupid.
I have taught her well.

741
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:46,092
Mama!  Where are you, mama?
I want my mother!

742
01:16:46,407 --> 01:16:53,575
Mama?  You raised me by yourself.
And you were so lonely.

743
01:16:54,595 --> 01:16:56,767
I want my mother.

744
01:16:57,432 --> 01:17:02,664
Hush now, my love.
I'll be your mother.

745
01:17:04,847 --> 01:17:10,038
Don't cry, my treasure,
Tell me your troubles.

746
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:15,353
I want my mother ...

747
01:18:00,458 --> 01:18:02,734
My mama...

748
01:18:13,119 --> 01:18:16,844
You feel so warm, mama.

749
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:45,010
At last, my love...

750
01:19:45,326 --> 01:19:51,861
- Mama...
- My beloved.  My lover...

751
01:19:58,468 --> 01:20:06,186
- Thank you, Mama!
- What a man you are, Giovannino...

752
01:20:50,171 --> 01:20:53,633
- Isn't that your boat, Don Frederico?
- I don't know, let me see.

753
01:20:59,226 --> 01:21:02,316
- Yes, that's my boat.
- Tie up to it!

754
01:21:02,535 --> 01:21:05,843
Go faster...

755
01:21:11,953 --> 01:21:16,130
- Giovannino!
- Again?

756
01:21:16,519 --> 01:21:19,764
No... I hear a boat.

757
01:21:27,912 --> 01:21:32,627
- Giovannino...
- It's Uncle Frederico.

758
01:21:32,718 --> 01:21:36,405
He brought the police.
Quickly!  Get dressed.

759
01:21:36,596 --> 01:21:40,871
Mrs. Lucia... Giovannino!

760
01:21:41,177 --> 01:21:45,651
Where you are?
It's Uncle Frederico.

761
01:21:45,878 --> 01:21:50,007
- Finally... Frederico.
- Thank goodness you found us, Uncle.

762
01:21:50,493 --> 01:21:54,989
Valentina is okay, Giovannino.
Some French campers rescued her.

763
01:21:55,094 --> 01:21:59,178
She's in good health.  In fact, I've
never seen anyone in such good health.

764
01:22:00,202 --> 01:22:04,205
I thought you should know, Mama.

765
01:22:04,748 --> 01:22:08,882
Yes, I'm so happy for you ...

766
01:22:08,903 --> 01:22:13,486
I've been thinking about this whole scandal...

767
01:22:14,711 --> 01:22:17,310
- Was your rescue alright?
- Alright?

768
01:22:17,448 --> 01:22:21,907
Why, it was beautiful!  It was
beautiful because he was beautiful.

769
01:22:21,908 --> 01:22:24,508
Beautiful any way you want it to mean.

770
01:22:24,927 --> 01:22:27,568
And Giovannino, when will he discover...

771
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:31,257
When will he figure it out?
He doesn't know about these things.

772
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:35,299
Now what should I do?
The fact that I've been used...

773
01:22:36,517 --> 01:22:40,102
- You told me to get an annulment...
- An annulment?

774
01:22:40,660 --> 01:22:44,174
No! No... don't annul anything.

775
01:22:44,257 --> 01:22:48,053
- Do you want a scandal, as well as a tragedy?
- But you told me to leave him.

776
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:51,075
No one is going to be left.
He's part of the family now.

777
01:22:52,823 --> 01:22:55,960
- Just yesterday you said ...
- One moment, Valentina!

778
01:22:56,310 --> 01:22:59,889
Yesterday was yesterday.
And today is today ...

779
01:23:01,124 --> 01:23:04,461
Why not go to him now
and try again.  He is a strong boy.

780
01:23:04,848 --> 01:23:08,400
A plant that sits in the shade and
is wilted ... if the rain comes, it blooms.

781
01:23:08,851 --> 01:23:13,409
Your mother may not understand plants
very well, but men... she knows well.

782
01:23:13,678 --> 01:23:17,402
You need to know how to use
what you've learned on Giovannino.

783
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:24,133
I'm sure after last night's
experience,  a new Giovannino was born.

784
01:23:24,585 --> 01:23:28,853
How do you know?  How can
you be so sure?  Who told you?

785
01:23:30,325 --> 01:23:35,278
A mother's intuition.
A mother is always right.

786
01:23:57,233 --> 01:24:02,792
You want to stop with that foot,
Mr. Frederico?  Don't expect a miracle.

787
01:24:02,834 --> 01:24:07,268
Please understand, Mrs. Lucia,
it's just a nervous impulse...

788
01:24:07,496 --> 01:24:10,225
Why can't we play pinch-pinch, Gianfranco?

789
01:24:10,235 --> 01:24:13,000
They get to do it and
we don't, my mandrill?

790
01:24:14,662 --> 01:24:19,253
Sit quietly now, fedayeen!
We need to concentrate on...

791
01:24:30,073 --> 01:24:33,995
- Be careful, you mental case!
- Excuse me, Mr. Frederico!

792
01:24:34,078 --> 01:24:37,548
Put the tray down carefully and go.
This is very important.

793
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:49,929
- Hey!  You scratched me with a fingernail.
- Excuse me, I did it on purpose.

794
01:24:50,014 --> 01:24:51,896
- Then you're forgiven...
- Brigitte!

795
01:24:51,977 --> 01:24:54,933
Even at this delicate time, is sex
the only thing you can think about?

796
01:24:59,112 --> 01:25:00,885
Mama Lucia!

797
01:25:04,217 --> 01:25:08,065
Please come in and
help us for a few minutes.

798
01:25:26,033 --> 01:25:30,864
- What's this?  All three in the bedroom?
- How nice, a threesome...

799
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:32,777
Quiet, you gorilla!

800
01:25:33,896 --> 01:25:39,395
You have 30 seconds... give me his name.
If not, I'll kill you.  You and her.

801
01:25:39,458 --> 01:25:44,974
- I'll slaughter everyone! I swear it!
- Stop, Giovannino!  No more screaming!

802
01:25:44,994 --> 01:25:49,034
If you don't, you'll bring on a scandal and
make the headlines.  Just calm down, my dear!

803
01:25:49,094 --> 01:25:51,965
How can I calm down, Mama?
Do you understand what's happened?

804
01:25:52,482 --> 01:25:58,046
This goddamn slut gave her virginity
while we suffered through the storm.

805
01:25:58,470 --> 01:26:00,607
Shouldn't I have been her first?

806
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:02,572
Shut up, Giovannino!

807
01:26:02,573 --> 01:26:06,174
No!  She just told me about it,
and I have something to say.

808
01:26:06,175 --> 01:26:10,548
- I want to know who it was and why she did it!
- That's enough Giovannino!  Shut your mouth!

809
01:26:11,588 --> 01:26:16,260
Now you two listen to me!
All this shit is unimportant.

810
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:19,777
What's important is your reputations.

811
01:26:19,903 --> 01:26:23,346
First!  Who can claim the glory
of being a virgin today?  Second...

812
01:26:23,503 --> 01:26:26,421
Second.  In my opinion, there's no
other way; Giovannino must go to Germany.

813
01:26:26,429 --> 01:26:30,898
- Oh, poor Valentina!
- I do not know that you should complain.

814
01:26:31,092 --> 01:26:35,081
Valentina can console herself
if she wants, but poor Giovannino...

815
01:26:37,808 --> 01:26:40,239
Sit back, everything is in order.

816
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:43,789
It was just a little misunderstanding.
Everything has been resolved.

817
01:26:43,203 --> 01:26:46,027
All's well that ends well!

818
01:26:46,114 --> 01:26:48,162
They played pinch-pinch!

819
01:26:50,502 --> 01:26:53,558
- So did they?
- All the way!

820
01:26:53,627 --> 01:26:57,202
This calls for some hot, strong coffee.  Gabriela!

821
01:26:57,207 --> 01:27:01,420
- Two strong coffees!
- And pour the brandy.  Several brandies...

822
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:04,499
And now some news for everyone.

823
01:27:04,521 --> 01:27:08,515
Tomorrow, Giovannino and
Valentina are coming to live with me.

824
01:27:10,103 --> 01:27:13,782
- Why? Don't they feel comfortable here?
- Of course, but try and be understanding!

825
01:27:14,287 --> 01:27:18,516
You ask for a reason.  Although
they're comfortable in this house...

826
01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:23,689
Giovannino will have an Oedipus
complex as long as he remains here.

827
01:27:25,204 --> 01:27:29,357
- So that's what happened to him ...
- It's a bit hard to explain.

828
01:27:29,373 --> 01:27:31,620
I try to explain
everything in a few words....

829
01:27:31,627 --> 01:27:38,971
To do his job as a husband, Giovannino
must get away from his home turf.

830
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:42,853
In this house, he misses his mother.

831
01:27:43,261 --> 01:27:44,626
Is it true, Giovannino?

832
01:27:46,427 --> 01:27:49,227
Answer him, Giovannino!

833
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,438
Yes, it's like Mama said!  It's true!
I must go to her home.

834
01:27:53,669 --> 01:28:00,414
Congratulations, Mrs. Lucia!
You saved my nephew from Oedipus.

835
01:28:00,731 --> 01:28:05,581
- If someone is worth saving...
- And you know the right way...

836
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:10,687
- Are you jealous?
- A little ...

837
01:28:11,530 --> 01:28:15,994
Please, allow me to
visit you from time to time.

838
01:28:16,101 --> 01:28:21,298
- Do you have an Oedipus complex as well?
- No, my complex is that I don't like to be alone.

839
01:28:21,786 --> 01:28:25,550
I'm a guy who can find consolation quickly.

840
01:28:26,340 --> 01:28:31,963
It would be better if the children don't see us.
If you want, I'll come to visit you.

841
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:38,452
If that's what you prefer, I have no
objection... even without an Oedipus complex.

842
01:29:18,647 --> 01:29:22,413
- Have you heard the latest news?
- I always know about everything.

843
01:29:22,506 --> 01:29:24,866
What do you think about it, Mr. Lawyer?

844
01:29:25,845 --> 01:29:30,210
It's not important what I think,
but people say that Giovannino...

845
01:29:31,006 --> 01:29:35,540
I know!
The mother-in-law brought him under her roof.

846
01:29:35,675 --> 01:29:41,557
You heard it right, Lieutenant.  But did the mother-
in-law bring him under her roof or into her bed?

847
01:29:41,578 --> 01:29:43,916
Into her bed...

848
01:30:59,878 --> 01:31:05,915
