1
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:47,088
Around the Earth float hundreds
of gigantic space colonies.

2
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,926
Half of humanity now lives in space.

3
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,890
It is the year 0079
of the Universal Century.

4
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,988
The colonies of Side 3 declared themselves
the Principality of Zeon

5
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,409
and launched a war of independence
against the Earth Federation.

6
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:23,291
One month after the war broke out,
it reached a stalemate.

7
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,926
Eight months later,

8
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,847
a Zeon cruiser under the command
of Lieutenant Commander Char Aznable

9
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,225
entered the vicinity of Side 7.

10
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:44,145
If the Federation's new battleship
has come to Side 7,

11
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:48,358
they must be conducting the final tests
on their mobile suits.

12
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,361
Orders, sir?

13
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,198
We need to make sure.

14
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,869
Send in three Zakus to reconnoiter.

15
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,750
Due to the use of Minovsky particles

16
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:09,295
which render radar and other tools
of electronic warfare useless,

17
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,591
wars have come to be fought
at close range even in space.

18
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:18,179
The humanoid weapons developed
for this close-quarters warfare

19
00:02:18,263 --> 00:02:19,722
were called mobile suits.

20
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,560
The Federation
had been slow to develop them.

21
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:30,191
However, a mobile suit that could stand up
to the Zeons' Zaku was nearly complete.

22
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,151
The power's on…

23
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:35,780
Amuro Ray, the son
of an immigrant weapons technician,

24
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,285
found himself sitting in the cockpit

25
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:43,580
of the new mobile suit Gundam.

26
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,426
Gate sensor, 360 degrees. All clear.

27
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,012
Your shoulders are too tense.

28
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,347
Relax. Let the computer handle this.

29
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,640
Yes, sir.

30
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:03,892
Run a system check!

31
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,727
Now exiting docking bay.

32
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,272
Now, with half the total population dead,

33
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,192
the ranks of both the Federation
and Zeon armies have been decimated.

34
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,697
Inexperienced young men
and women are sent into battle.

35
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,159
Newtype? A Newtype, you say?

36
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,246
From what I've heard,
Zeon has been looking into them.

37
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,416
They say they're like espers.
People with good intuition.

38
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:33,463
If we had men like that, the Zeon soldiers
in these parts would be wiped out by now.

39
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,091
I'll ram the Gaw into the Trojan Horse!

40
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,469
Perhaps this wait
for the appearance of Newtypes,

41
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,971
the next stage in human evolution,

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,099
was just the wishful thinking
of those who had grown war-weary.

43
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:51,481
Garma Zabi, youngest son of the Sovereign
of Zeon, attacked White Base.

44
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:57,153
The only reason its crew survived
was because they wanted to survive.

45
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,323
Glory to the Principality of Zeon!

46
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:08,456
During that battle, Amuro Ray's skill
as a soldier grew rapidly.

47
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,295
Amuro! Wait!

48
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,089
Amuro!

49
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,840
Amuro!

50
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,913
SOLDIERS OF SORROW

51
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,381
It has a fine ring, doesn't it?

52
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,300
Yes, sir. Is it a special piece?

53
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,635
It's a Hokuso, I believe.
What do you want?

54
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,597
A division under Revil's command
has crossed the Straits of Dover.

55
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,059
-Commander M'Quve!
-What?

56
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,187
We have news on the Trojan Horse!

57
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,399
It seems to have changed course
to south-southwest.

58
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:21,195
This isn't good.
It's shadowing Revil's division.

59
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,533
Uragan! Ramba Ral's unit
came down to avenge Garma.

60
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,244
Inform him of this.

61
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,417
If he can destroy the Trojan Horse,
I won't have to split my own forces.

62
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,670
We're under Kycilia Zabi's command.

63
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,466
Ral's unit is under Dozle's command!
We don't have to help them!

64
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,177
We can let them help us, though.

65
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,428
Sir!

66
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,605
-Give me the data.
-Sir!

67
00:05:55,688 --> 00:06:01,110
The Federation Forces are advancing
on our defense line along eight routes.

68
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,248
M'Quve is giving us the location
of the Trojan Horse?

69
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,333
What's he up to?

70
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,335
He wants us gone.

71
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,421
This unit,
under Admiral Dozle's direct command,

72
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,716
is poking around
in Admiral Kycilia's jurisdiction.

73
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,593
A shooting star!

74
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,762
I didn't see anything.

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,807
You can still see them on Earth.

76
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,392
-That's because the air is still clean.
-True.

77
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,145
Darling?

78
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,981
Why did you accept this mission?

79
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,567
-You think I shouldn't have?
-No.

80
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,823
Like you said, this mission
is part of the Zabi family's vendetta.

81
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:52,036
If I destroy the Trojan Horse
and avenge Lord Garma's death.

82
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,330
I'll get a special two-rank promotion.

83
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,417
My men's prospects
are tied to my own success.

84
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,752
So this is for your men?

85
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,881
And for you. Through the Zabis,
we can live closer together.

86
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,342
Just watch.

87
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,718
I believe in you.

88
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,848
You're attacking the Trojan Horse
first thing tomorrow, right?

89
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,015
Let's turn in.

90
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:38,749
The 136th regiment's Matilda Unit
has made contact with White Base.

91
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,087
Now we just have to deploy two fleets
southwards to drive them from the rear.

92
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,884
That would seem to be
the most prudent course.

93
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:51,762
Is something bothering you,
Lieutenant General Elran?

94
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,767
Yes, sir. White Base will be the only ship
attacking from the right rear flank.

95
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,022
Do you really think they're Newtypes, sir?

96
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,151
You read the battle reports, didn't you?

97
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:09,530
It certainly leads me to believe
in the abilities of the Gundam's pilot.

98
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:16,370
But isn't it dangerous to assume
that White Base is a ship of Newtypes

99
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,289
based on less than two weeks' data?

100
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:23,002
Yes, but I can't spare any more units
from the front.

101
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,339
That Zeon soldier, Char, the Red Comet…

102
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:30,551
Rumor among the men
is that he's a Newtype.

103
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:36,140
Zeon Deikun used to say that Newtypes
are the next step in human reformation.

104
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,019
If he's right, it's only natural
for some of them to be in our army.

105
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,606
The Red Comet is an anomaly.

106
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,734
No one can destroy that many ships
with a single Zaku.

107
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:51,030
Then what about that boy, Amuro?

108
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:55,493
He was able to pilot our Gundam
without any training.

109
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,078
Surely that isn't normal either.

110
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,420
Good work.

111
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,506
Oh, Lieutenant Matilda!

112
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,216
What are those?

113
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,468
Parts for the Gundam.

114
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,806
I have to repair it myself anyway,
so I thought I'd sort them out.

115
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,224
That's very diligent of you.

116
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,643
-Where are you headed?
-Up to the bridge.

117
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,354
-I'll walk you there.
-That won't be necessary.

118
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,982
I have a system for that too.
I know a shortcut.

119
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:38,703
Good morning.

120
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:39,870
Morning.

121
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,163
Amuro!

122
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,290
What?

123
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:46,877
You said you'd fix the AC in my room
once you were done eating!

124
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:47,795
I did?

125
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,672
Jeez!

126
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,507
Jeez!

127
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,679
It's true! Up close,
that Lieutenant Matilda's a real babe!

128
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,473
She's my type.
She's a sharp dresser and she's sweet.

129
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,892
I wish I had a girlfriend like her.

130
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,519
I see some idle hands here.

131
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,983
Good morning, Lieutenant!

132
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,027
Find yourself a good girlfriend, okay?

133
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,571
I'm already humiliated, Lieutenant,
so I might as well ask…

134
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:18,618
If you don't mind,
can I get a picture with you?

135
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,661
Sure. How about now?

136
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,413
Sure! I'd be honored!

137
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,753
Cut it out! I can only make 12 copies!

138
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,213
-What's the holdup?
-Just take it already!

139
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,798
Okay, here goes…

140
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,679
Damn it!

141
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,770
Lieutenant Bright,
I've brought Lieutenant Matilda.

142
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:46,979
Thank you.

143
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:47,938
Sorry, I'm late.

144
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,192
-Is the ship ready to depart?
-Yes, in 30 minutes.

145
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,030
We'll cut through the desert and head
for the Black Sea via the Caspian Sea.

146
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,156
Excuse me.

147
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,425
Something's approaching.

148
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,595
It's one unit, but there's too much
Minovsky interference to get a read on it.

149
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,263
What do you think it is?

150
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,141
Probably a ground combat type. It's fast.

151
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,894
It's at one o'clock.
Sayla, can you see it?

152
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,896
No, sir!

153
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,524
-You're sure there's only one?
-Yes, sir!

154
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,319
Just one unit…

155
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,280
The pilot might know my brother…

156
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:42,159
I admire your courage.

157
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:44,412
But you don't look like
a soldier or guerrilla fighter.

158
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:48,332
Take off the helmet and turn around!

159
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,387
A Zeon soldier might've heard
something about my brother Casval…

160
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:03,055
Sayla!

161
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,682
You don't know what model it is?

162
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:07,476
It looks like a ground combat model,
but that's all we know.

163
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,020
That puts us at a disadvantage.

164
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,730
How do we fight something we don't know?

165
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,025
Starboard machine gunners!
Level 1 battle stations!

166
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:18,362
I want the Gundam, Guncannon,
and Guntank standing by!

167
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,990
Don't send them out yet.

168
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,921
Clamp, are the mobile suits in position?

169
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,965
Yes, ma'am. Watch this.

170
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:42,178
We'll attack the enemy's flank
in the Gallop

171
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,598
while Lieutenant Ral takes it out
with his three Zakus.

172
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,057
Very good.

173
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,319
The Gundam!

174
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,780
Job! Who's in the Gundam?

175
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,200
It's Sayla!
She said she had special orders!

176
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:06,243
You mean she lied?

177
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,078
I don't believe it… Sayla!

178
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,459
Catapult secure! Launch!

179
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:29,225
I thought I'd mastered this
in the simulator…

180
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,268
I didn't expect the G-force
to be this bad!

181
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,569
-Take us in closer!
-Yes, ma'am!

182
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:47,910
I have to make contact
with the Zeon soldiers…

183
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,827
Enemy units?

184
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:55,668
From the right?

185
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,931
Sayla! Get up!

186
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,308
Go!

187
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,067
Sayla!

188
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,278
What about the pilot?

189
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,126
Too bad the sand acted as a cushion…

190
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,335
Here he comes!

191
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,344
Where is he?

192
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,560
I have to force it into close combat…

193
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,479
Cozun! Don't be stupid! Pull back!

194
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,409
Watch this, Lieutenant Ral!
I'll capture this Mobile Suit!

195
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,206
The main camera!

196
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,877
He's destroying my cameras…

197
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,383
If we let that new model get close
to the Gundam,

198
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,927
we won't be able to save it!

199
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,970
That thing's just too fast!

200
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,853
Damn! The Zakus are too far apart.

201
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,812
Cozun! Are you okay?

202
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:42,066
I think so, sir.
I'll try to disable it myself.

203
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,778
Acous! Can you get past the red one
to get close to Cozun?

204
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,862
Yes, sir!

205
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,870
Damn! I'm out of ammo!

206
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,788
The red one!

207
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:03,295
Cozun! Get out of there now!
They just took out Acous!

208
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,218
They got Acous, sir?

209
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,430
What's going on?

210
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,434
Lieutenant Ral!

211
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,604
You'll pay for that!

212
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,280
Cozun!

213
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:33,158
Cozun, come in! Are you hit?

214
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,829
Hamon, do you read me?
Send in the Gallop! I'll meet you!

215
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:50,092
You'll obey the Antarctic Treaty's
POW provisions, I assume?

216
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,093
Of course.

217
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:58,684
I want three square meals a day.
I'm an officer, you know.

218
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,147
Well, well. Our Valkyrie returns.

219
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,445
Sayla.

220
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,281
Sayla!

221
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,367
I read you, Captain.

222
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,078
-Report to the bridge immediately.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:24,585
You wanted to prove that a woman
can fight as well as a man?

224
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,336
Is that the only reason?

225
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,337
Yes, sir.

226
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,131
Why did you do it? It's not like you.

227
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,260
We have to discipline you
to maintain order on this ship.

228
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,555
Three days of solitary. Understand?

229
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,766
I don't mind.

230
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,852
Take care of it, Ryu.

231
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,528
-Food for the prisoner?
-That's right.

232
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,905
You need more guards with you.

233
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,492
I'll do it, Fraw.

234
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,413
What a babe…

235
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,375
Who is the Red Comet?

236
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,253
The Red Comet? Why do you want to know?

237
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,881
Why wouldn't I? He's a legend.

238
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,052
His real name is Char Aznable.

239
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,931
They say he was a wanderer
who drifted to Zeon from Earth.

240
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:21,058
I heard he fell out of favor with Zeon

241
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:25,062
after he failed to protect Garma Zabi
from you guys.

242
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,774
He fell out of favor?
And is he really from Earth?

243
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,317
Yes.

244
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,489
That's why some people think
he may have a grudge against the Zabis.

245
00:18:35,572 --> 00:18:37,491
It makes sense.

246
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,119
So he's no longer welcome
in the Zeon military?

247
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,078
Sayla!

248
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:45,040
Far from it.
I hear Kycilia has taken him in.

249
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,917
-Thanks.
-You shouldn't be talking to him.

250
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,798
Keep your chin up. It's only three days.

251
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,425
Don't worry about me, Ryu.

252
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:57,845
If you need anything, just let me know.

253
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,555
Thanks, Fraw.

254
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:17,489
He's my brother, all right…

255
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,913
Thank God…

256
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:32,254
Casval!

257
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,632
Why are you leaving?

258
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,759
Casval!

259
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,555
Casval!

260
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,933
Casval!

261
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,079
How is it coming along?

262
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,917
Thanks to that Zaku we captured,
I know exactly what it can do now.

263
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,338
But how are you going to simulate
the Gouf suit the prisoner mentioned?

264
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,674
I use the Zaku's data,
and increase everything by 20%,

265
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,386
That's our Amuro, nothing ever stumps him.

266
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,263
Want me to take over?

267
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,182
Sure, thanks.

268
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,144
-You should get some sleep too, Amuro.
-Yes, ma'am.

269
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,689
Any progress, Bright?

270
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,776
Are all your female soldiers this young?

271
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,696
He refuses to believe
that I'm in command of this vessel.

272
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:45,410
Where is your Gallop's base,
Ensign Cozun Graham?

273
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:48,538
There are rules regarding
the treatment of enemy officers, you know.

274
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,999
I'm familiar
with the Antarctic Treaty, Ensign.

275
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,628
What can you tell me
about M'Quve's mining operation?

276
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,422
It's going to take more than this
to make me talk.

277
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,142
This Zaku's seen a lot of use.
Has it been checked out, Clamp?

278
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,062
It's been overhauled. It's fine.

279
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,815
The joints have been replaced
with new ones.

280
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,693
Good. Send back the Fat Uncle!

281
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,861
Okay! Get going!

282
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,619
Water!

283
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,999
Amuro, fix it! Fix the faucet!

284
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,125
The faucet?

285
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,465
Kikka!
Mirai's still in there, right? Go ask her.

286
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,592
Mirai, the faucet!

287
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,219
What's the matter?

288
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:47,848
Amuro, are you still there?
Check the faucet, will you?

289
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,934
Sure. Pardon me.

290
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,602
All right, let me see.

291
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,690
Kikka, where's the faucet handle?

292
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,567
It's in the sink.

293
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,120
It's fixed!

294
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,206
You're a lifesaver, Amuro.
Is it fixed now?

295
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,294
Yes, ma'am. Well, I'll be going now.

296
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,839
You won't be getting out anytime soon!

297
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,927
Amateurs! They don't even know
how to do a proper body search.

298
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:50,494
You're from Zeon, aren't you?
You can come with me if you want.

299
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,080
You misunderstood me.

300
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,457
If you're trying to escape,
I'll call the guards!

301
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,126
-What?
-The prisoner's escaping! Come quickly!

302
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,628
You bitch!

303
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,672
Missiles, sir!

304
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,091
Missiles! Horizontal launch!

305
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,891
M'Quve has a mining base this far east?

306
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,143
Sorry I took so long!

307
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,312
Infrared scope! Maximum magnification!

308
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,361
Amuro, get ready to launch the Gundam.

309
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,737
We'll attack their base!

310
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,198
Roger! Amuro, launching!

311
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:31,243
Amuro! Are you sure about this?
We're disobeying orders!

312
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,412
Relax, I don't need
the Gundam to destroy a mine.

313
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,705
The tank can do the job.

314
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,339
It's the Guntank! It's Amuro and Hayato!

315
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:46,383
What? Ryu's not in there?

316
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,510
-Number one hatch!
-Bright!

317
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,553
Ryu! Where are you?

318
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,681
Sayla says the prisoner has escaped!

319
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,015
What?

320
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,893
I'll have her look for him.
I'll go out in the Guntank!

321
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,187
The Guntank already launched.

322
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,314
-What?
-Too late to do anything about it now.

323
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:06,069
Hurry up and find the prisoner!
If need be, shoot to kill!

324
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,237
-Take care of it.
-Okay.

325
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,323
Thank you, Bright.
I'll find him, no matter what it takes.

326
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,867
Don't mention it.

327
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,994
Run a system check! Move it!

328
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,292
Why is this thing so hard to tune?

329
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:23,587
Got it!

330
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:28,675
Mustang 2, this is Cozun!
I'm calling from the Trojan Horse.

331
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,927
There you are, sir.

332
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,471
-Incoming transmission from Cozun!
-What? From Cozun?

333
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:37,642
There are three types:
Gundam, Guntank, and Guncannon.

334
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,020
There is only one of each
aboard the Trojan Horse.

335
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,396
I haven't seen any fighters, but…

336
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,569
Is someone in Comm Room 2?

337
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:49,487
What? Why would there be?

338
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,239
A comm channel is being used!

339
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,699
Put it on the monitor!

340
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,621
The TV line's been cut!

341
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,331
Kill the master comm circuit!

342
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,248
Yes, sir!

343
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,752
Damn it!

344
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,517
Bright, how much do you think
he's told them?

345
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,518
I don't know.

346
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,855
We already have those enemy guns
up there to worry about,

347
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,524
and now Ramba Ral's Gallop
is probably headed our way.

348
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,447
Right flank!

349
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,789
What did Commander M'Quve say?

350
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,832
That he can't send a single unit!

351
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,585
The EFF main force is attacking
from the European front!

352
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:50,257
Why are they attacking a mine
that has no strategic value?

353
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,841
-Lieutenant!
-What is it?

354
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,261
Ramba Ral's Gallop will back us up!

355
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,220
Ramba Ral?

356
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,063
Cozun, make it back in one piece…

357
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,440
Here he comes!

358
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,444
Defensive attack! Go get him, Haro!

359
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,445
Attack!

360
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:22,872
There he is…

361
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:29,045
The Trojan Horse and a tank?
That's strange…

362
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,677
The white one's not here,
but I'll cover you!

363
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,682
The Gouf!

364
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,648
Hayato, fall back! The Guntank's
no good against moving targets!

365
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,734
Kai, do you read me? Cover us!

366
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,241
Get serious, White Base!
One Guncannon can't handle this!

367
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,953
Understood! Mirai! Take us in!

368
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:02,912
Yes, sir!

369
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,206
Right flank!
Don't let that Gallop get any closer!

370
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,090
This should do the trick…

371
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,510
Sayla! Where's the prisoner?

372
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,888
In the airlock!
We have to stop him from escaping!

373
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:20,805
On it!

374
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,393
They won't be able to get through
with just a pistol.

375
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,606
Sayla! Get back!

376
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,400
Here goes…

377
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,371
Sayla…

378
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:49,042
Don't worry about it.
We may end up like that someday.

379
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:49,959
Right…

380
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,589
The suit's going to blow!

381
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,017
Guncannon retrieved! Retreat, Bright!

382
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,402
So the Zaku and the Gouf move differently

383
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,821
because of their pilots
and their environment…

384
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,617
Maybe I should rethink my approach.

385
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,512
I really don't think it's a good idea.

386
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:46,015
I've had Job and Omur run simulations.

387
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,684
Still…

388
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,149
The Guncannon isn't repaired yet?

389
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,985
They're making a replacement arm
in the machine shop.

390
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,363
You think Amuro's a Newtype, Mirai?

391
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:05,285
How else would you explain
everything he's accomplished so far?

392
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,662
I'll give you that, but there's no proof.

393
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,541
The question now
is how we're going to survive.

394
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,419
They say that Newtypes
are the next stage in human evolution.

395
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:16,588
If Amuro's showing signs of being one…

396
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,798
We don't have time
to wait for it to happen.

397
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,009
We should give the Gundam to someone else.

398
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,051
Bright!

399
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:27,474
He needs to be disciplined
before he develops a superiority complex.

400
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,393
Mirai, please. Back me up on this.

401
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,563
Amuro!

402
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,237
Were you listening?

403
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,957
-Amuro!
-Let him go!

404
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,629
This saves us the trouble
of explaining ourselves.

405
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,797
You think so?

406
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,632
Okay, next!

407
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,594
Amuro! Where are you going?

408
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:08,473
I'm leaving White Base.
Take care of yourself.

409
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,475
What?

410
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,310
I'm leaving the ship.

411
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,645
What happened?

412
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:19,651
Bright and Mirai say I'm not needed here,
so I'm leaving the ship.

413
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,986
-Wait!
-Don't try to stop me!

414
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,033
Amuro!

415
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,372
Lieutenant Bright! The Gundam's launching!

416
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:35,124
Gundam, come in! Who's the pilot?

417
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,334
The Gundam?

418
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,044
Come in!

419
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,129
Marker! Can't you close the hatch?

420
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,965
Too late! The catapult's firing!

421
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,550
It's Amuro! Amuro's in there!

422
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,343
Amuro!

423
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,976
Damn you, Amuro.

424
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:13,973
A tent?

425
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,564
Do you have any water?

426
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,609
I can't spare any.

427
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,946
There's a town nearby. Buy some there.

428
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,698
I see. Thanks.

429
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,256
Do you have anything to eat?

430
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,437
Newtypes aren't real.
It's all just wishful thinking.

431
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,232
-You think so?
-You don't?

432
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,860
How do you explain
Amuro's piloting skills?

433
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,114
I don't care if he's a Newtype.
He violated military regulations.

434
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,910
They're just on-the-spot draftees
and you keep talking about regulations!

435
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,787
This isn't fun anymore…

436
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,552
Look, Commander! A restaurant!
Let's take a break!

437
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,977
Innkeeper, we're taking a break here!
There's 13 of us.

438
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:42,729
I'll be right with you.

439
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,232
This way, Ms. Hamon!

440
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:05,543
Sorry, Sagred, Mile. You're on watch.
I'll send replacements soon.

441
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,129
-Yes, sir, Lieutenant Ramba Ral!
-Yes, sir, Lieutenant Ramba Ral!

442
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,839
Ramba Ral?

443
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,341
Innkeeper, bring us some delicious water!

444
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,096
Sit down and eat whatever you want.

445
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,681
It's our last meal before the operation.

446
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,099
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

447
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,518
-What will you have, darling?
-I'll let you decide.

448
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:28,149
If I may, Sodon is a neutral zone.
If you engage the enemy here--

449
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,859
We won't be fighting here. Relax.

450
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:33,196
There's not much on the menu.
Cook whatever you can for 14 people.

451
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,614
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:38,201
-There's only 13 of us, Hamon.
-It's for the young man over there.

453
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,083
Kind of young for you, isn't he?

454
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,834
Don't be silly.

455
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,269
Why didn't I think of it?
He has to get something to eat!

456
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,487
What's going on?

457
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,122
I do appreciate the gesture,
but I'm afraid I have to decline.

458
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,039
Why?

459
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,709
There's no reason for me
to accept a handout from you.

460
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,257
The boy has you there, Hamon!

461
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:40,012
How about because I like you?
Is that reason enough?

462
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,264
Well, that's…

463
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,809
It's rare for Hamon
to take a liking to someone, boy.

464
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:48,020
That's right.
If you turn her down, you'll regret it.

465
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,148
I envy you, kid.

466
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,400
Not every man is as lucky as you are!

467
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,237
I'm no beggar.

468
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,491
I like you, boy.
You don't mince your words.

469
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:06,164
It's not just Hamon's treat.
I'm paying too.

470
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,999
That makes it okay, right?

471
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,250
That's not the point…

472
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,127
Commander! We caught someone suspicious!

473
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,295
A spy?

474
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,005
A woman who was acting strange, sir!

475
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,424
What? She's just a child!

476
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:17,675
Fraw Bow!

477
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,346
A friend of yours?

478
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,015
Yes.

479
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,851
But she's wearing a Federation uniform!

480
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,647
-You think so? It's not quite the same.
-It's one of theirs, all right.

481
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,608
Is that true, Hamon?

482
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,776
So it would seem…

483
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,988
This boy says she's his girlfriend.

484
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,032
Amuro!

485
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,659
-Let her go.
-But--

486
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:44,827
Just do it.

487
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,497
I like that look in your eyes.

488
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:55,338
And you're brave.
You've earned my respect.

489
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,381
"Amuro," was it?

490
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,758
Yes, sir.

491
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,349
Don't expect me to let you go
when we meet on the battlefield.

492
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,642
Good luck, Amuro.

493
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,812
Thank you, Mr. Ral. You too, Ms. Hamon.

494
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,148
I appreciate it.

495
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,986
Amuro…

496
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,904
Let's go.

497
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,826
-Hey!
-Sir?

498
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,371
Follow them, Zeygan.

499
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:32,041
If there are Federation troops around,
the Trojan Horse must be here.

500
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,169
What's the matter with you?

501
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,964
I told you to leave me alone!

502
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:43,302
If you think we can't survive without you,
think again.

503
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,389
Look who's talking!
You got caught by Zeon soldiers!

504
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:47,890
And what about you?

505
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,309
Amuro!

506
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,232
Get in.

507
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,571
I bet you let go of my hand
because that woman was watching.

508
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,662
You're distancing yourself
further and further from me…

509
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,584
Bye.

510
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,670
-You're not going to White Base?
-No.

511
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,173
You better get back
before you get sunstroke.

512
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,883
You'll regret this!

513
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,845
-I'm free to live my life when I'm alone.
-You're so stubborn!

514
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,975
And I'm not going to regret it!

515
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,963
You saw the Gouf? The enemy mobile suit?

516
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:04,216
Yes. They must've been loaded
onto those two large trailers.

517
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,551
Did you run into Amuro?

518
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,012
Yes. He was also in Sodon.

519
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:15,144
I bet that bum Amuro told Zeon
about White Base!

520
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,855
Watch it, Kai!

521
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,025
We should stop the repairs
and prepare to intercept an attack.

522
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:30,659
There we go!

523
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:44,256
I can't believe he sent Fraw…
Bright should've come himself.

524
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,342
Because I like you.

525
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:50,221
Hamon likes you, you lucky dog!

526
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,017
Are they really the people
we're fighting against?

527
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,904
Fraw was followed!

528
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,538
A tank?

529
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,584
Hayato! Looks like two enemy units!

530
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,337
-Don't let them near White Base!
-Roger!

531
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,716
Stetch, I'm going airborne.
Take out that tank!

532
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,885
Yes sir, Lieutenant Ral!

533
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,516
Ryu! The caterpillar's hit!

534
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,559
Damn it!

535
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,646
Damn Zaku!

536
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,482
Ryu! I'm going to eject
the Guntank's upper half!

537
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,527
But what about you, Hayato?
You won't be able to move!

538
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:54,410
I'll keep the enemy at bay! Go find Amuro!

539
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,328
Roger that, Hayato!

540
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,423
Perfect, I can take them from behind!

541
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,134
A Zaku's approaching us from behind!

542
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,261
What? What about the aft missiles?

543
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,387
No one's manning them!

544
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:15,014
Full speed ahead!

545
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,480
That careless idiot!

546
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,984
Bastard!

547
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,740
Hayato! Kai! Listen!

548
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,075
Can you take out the Gouf from there?

549
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,953
Bright! I'll shake the Gouf loose!

550
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,247
What? Can you do it, Mirai?

551
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,168
I'm going to invert the ship!
Fasten your seatbelts!

552
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,128
-But what about you?
-I'll be fine.

553
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,097
Is that him?

554
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,189
If I use the beam rifle now, I won't be
able to use it against the Gouf!

555
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,200
Amuro! Do you read me? I'll keep him busy!

556
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,368
Head for White Base!

557
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,870
Ryu! You came for me?

558
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,138
I'm dead!

559
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:44,311
This must be the Gundam!
Where was it hiding?

560
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,355
Amuro! What took you so long?

561
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,651
Damn Gouf!

562
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,615
What precise shooting…

563
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,784
That makes it easy
for my computer to predict his moves.

564
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,623
To hell with this!
I only have one shot left anyway!

565
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,837
That's one determined pilot.
But that won't save him!

566
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,947
What?

567
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:50,794
Nice move, Gundam,
but my controls are still operational!

568
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,672
Here he comes!

569
00:43:58,802 --> 00:43:59,762
I knew it!

570
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,475
You! The boy from town!

571
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,521
You only helped us
so you could follow us to White Base!

572
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,358
I can't believe it…
Times really have changed.

573
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,318
The boy's a pilot!

574
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,573
Well?

575
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:30,876
Well done! But you didn't win
because you were the better pilot, boy!

576
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,713
You only won because of the Gundam!
Never forget that!

577
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:36,340
What a sore loser!

578
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,302
Wait!

579
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:54,691
Not much choice. I'll wait until nightfall
and meet up with Hamon.

580
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,451
Going rogue is a serious offense!
No exceptions!

581
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,955
-The Gundam is no longer yours to pilot.
-Please listen to me!

582
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:10,833
I didn't leave White Base
because I wanted to!

583
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:11,834
I have an excuse!

584
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,794
But I don't have to listen to it.

585
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:19,091
Bright! You know you'll need me again
if Ral comes back!

586
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:20,467
Amuro!

587
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,510
Ryu…

588
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,889
Sayla and I can pilot the Gundam now.

589
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,185
Think about what that means, Amuro.

590
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,855
Ryu! Kai!

591
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,691
Ryu! Bright!

592
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,944
We'll have to work all night on repairs.

593
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:42,739
That Gallop may have been damaged,
but it'll be back.

594
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,534
Yes. Look, are you sure about Amuro?

595
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,163
You didn't have to put me in solitary!

596
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:52,124
Bright! Lieutenant Bright!

597
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:55,794
Or Mirai, if you're there…
Just listen to me!

598
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,005
There's something I want to say!

599
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,298
You blew it, Amuro…

600
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,384
I know you can hear me on the monitors!

601
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,310
I can use…

602
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:14,938
the Gundam better than anyone.

603
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,609
Better than anyone!

604
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,919
Don't get cocky! You didn't win
because you were the better pilot,

605
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,379
you only won because of the Gundam!

606
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,927
You've got guts.
Maybe that's why Hamon likes you.

607
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,137
It's my treat, Amuro.

608
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,226
I want to…

609
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,980
fight him again and win.

610
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:23,090
He's having trouble
with Revil's forces at Odessa?

611
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,802
Yes, sir. Commander M'Quve says
that's why he can't send reinforcements.

612
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,932
He asks that you capture
the Trojan Horse on your own, sir.

613
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,934
And he wants us to capture it undamaged?

614
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,394
Yes, sir.

615
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:37,688
How selfish.

616
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,232
I understand.

617
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:44,486
Tell him I'll complete the mission
with my bare hands if necessary.

618
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,572
-Yes, sir!
-Dismissed.

619
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,698
Excuse me, sir.

620
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,450
What are you going to do?

621
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,997
It's a chance to avenge
Garma's death. I have to do it.

622
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:02,129
We don't have much, but we can
hit them using guerrilla tactics.

623
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:05,340
-What do you say, Clamp?
-The troops will be glad to hear it, sir.

624
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:14,141
White Base will be our only support ship
on the right rear flank.

625
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,892
We don't have
any other land battleships to spare.

626
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,520
Is it wise
to rely so heavily on them, sir?

627
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,773
If they can't survive a risk
as small as this,

628
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,318
they can't be called a Newtype unit,
Lieutenant General Elran.

629
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,904
All that's left now
is to see how fast your team

630
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,032
can repair White Base's engines.

631
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,658
We'll do our best.

632
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:36,872
And there's something
I'd like you to deliver to White Base.

633
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:39,750
They'll probably be angry with us
for using them as guinea pigs again.

634
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,002
I want them to test the Core Booster.

635
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,253
"Booster," sir?

636
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:47,007
-Here's the inventory.
-Very well, sir.

637
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,010
These are our three Doms for land battle!

638
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,179
You can count on us, Commander M'Quve.

639
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,310
The Gaia Unit's strength
will equal that of a full division.

640
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:04,566
First, we attack Revil's front.
Then the Trojan Horse.

641
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,569
Isn't that a little naive?
They're Newtypes, aren't they?

642
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,281
I don't believe
in the existence of Newtypes.

643
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,326
That's because you don't fight
on the frontline, sir.

644
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:19,122
The Trojan Horse is a formidable enemy.
We mustn't underestimate it.

645
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,209
They win because you only think
in terms of brute force.

646
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:28,965
Zaku! Ghien! Launch! Next, the Cui!

647
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,442
All right, young man.

648
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,277
How will you make your entrance, I wonder?

649
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,489
All hands, wake up! Oscar! Marker!

650
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,657
Sayla! What's the count?

651
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,033
Unknown!

652
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:56,535
-Start the engines!
-Yes, sir!

653
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,120
I'll go out in the Gundam!

654
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,748
Roger! Now opening
forward surveillance camera!

655
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,376
Hurry up with a firing solution!
Open the main cannons!

656
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,420
It's the Gallop!

657
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:21,810
Lieutenant Bright!
The Gundam is ready to launch!

658
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,728
Thanks, Sayla.

659
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,271
Here I go!

660
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,068
-Two tanks closing in from behind!
-What?

661
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,071
-Cancel mobile suit launch!
-What?

662
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,823
All hands, prepare for close combat!

663
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,782
What?

664
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,743
-Prepare for close combat!
-Close combat?

665
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,703
Hurry! They're coming in from behind!

666
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,789
Fraw, let Amuro out of solitary.

667
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,834
The door will open
with a type 6E key. Got that?

668
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,630
Amuro! You have orders to fight!

669
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,799
-Where's the Gundam?
-Sayla launched it.

670
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,968
They want you
to man a starboard machine gun.

671
00:50:55,051 --> 00:50:55,969
Understood.

672
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,305
Sorry I'm late!

673
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,807
A backwards jump!

674
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:06,646
I see it!

675
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,529
Charge!

676
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:17,866
Here they come!

677
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,549
Where is he? Where's Ramba Ral?

678
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:40,639
It's no use! The Gundam's weapons
are just too powerful!

679
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,432
I don't want to damage the ship!

680
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,228
You jerk! Go away! Get off the ship!

681
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,605
What? What's this kid doing here?

682
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,361
Get back! You'll get hurt!

683
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,196
Get away from there!

684
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,494
Oscar and Marker,
guard the entrance to the bridge!

685
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,454
-Job John, take the front!
-Yes, ma'am!

686
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,209
I can make it!

687
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,552
There's one!

688
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,847
Hatch 78's been breached!

689
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:22,764
What?

690
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:24,808
Bastard!

691
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:43,285
I can fight without the Gundam!

692
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,623
Go get the Gundam from Sayla!

693
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:50,876
Use it to drive the enemy
out of the secondary bridge!

694
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,960
But how?

695
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,462
-Destroy the bridge if you have to!
-Yes, sir!

696
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,842
Sayla!

697
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,760
-It's all yours, Amuro!
-Thanks!

698
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,220
-The enemy?
-Secondary bridge!

699
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,138
Got it!

700
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:07,893
Don't you think it's weird?
These soldiers are all kids…

701
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,604
They must be short on men too.

702
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,688
It's opening!

703
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,857
Enemy soldiers!

704
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,484
-Straight ahead!
-Not on my watch!

705
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:20,655
Cut the circuits to the main bridge.

706
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,656
Yes, sir!

707
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:29,748
You! You're Lady Artesia!

708
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,170
I'd recognize you anywhere.

709
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,756
Don't you remember me?

710
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:40,967
I'm Ramba Ral, the son of Jimba Ral!

711
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,553
He was in the revolution
with your father, Zeon Deikun!

712
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,186
Why are you pointing a gun
at me if you know I'm Artesia?

713
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,648
But why are you on this warship?

714
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,066
Sayla! Move back!

715
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,029
Ryu!

716
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,657
Ramba Ral! Go!

717
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,494
Amuro, do you read me?

718
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,913
They've taken the secondary bridge!
Destroy it!

719
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,956
Roger!

720
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:15,335
-Have you made contact with Hamon?
-Yes, sir! I've set the frequency!

721
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,421
I want all of you to withdraw!
The mission's a failure!

722
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:19,339
Darling?

723
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:23,426
I'm sorry, Hamon…
Destroy the Trojan Horse with the Gallop.

724
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,930
It's my fault.
I lowered my defenses and forgot to fight…

725
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:28,348
What happened?

726
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,569
That boy in the Gundam again?

727
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,993
Pay close attention.
This is what it means…

728
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,704
to be defeated in battle!

729
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,881
Ral…

730
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,767
Ms. Hamon! Mr. Ral's dead!

731
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,270
Stop!

732
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:21,609
Eject the bridge!

733
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:34,873
Was it that boy?

734
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:45,050
Ramba Ral… Hamon…

735
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,970
Plane 4 to Plane 1! We can't go on!

736
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:49,971
Go on without us!

737
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,222
Roger!

738
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,516
Can we fly at a lower altitude?

739
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,601
Yes, ma'am.

740
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,269
How many enemy units are there?

741
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,229
Two, I think.

742
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,574
Looks like they won't overlook
even a small group like ours.

743
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:10,784
-Can we make it?
-Yes, ma'am!

744
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:19,042
Using this battle as a signal,
the Federation Forces launched an attack

745
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,462
against the special mining base
protected by M'Quve's forces.

746
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:24,631
This was the commencement
of Operation Odessa.

747
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:27,926
If the Federation won here,

748
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:33,556
they would avoid a protracted war,
even out in space.

749
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,520
I can't do it!

750
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:42,065
You have the aptitude for it.
You can do it.

751
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:45,360
-Bring in the Core Booster set!
-Yes, ma'am.

752
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:49,239
Do you really think Amuro
and Sayla have Newtype abilities?

753
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:53,743
They'll decide that at Jaburo.
Personally, I don't know.

754
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,746
All I can say is that
their records indicate it.

755
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:00,333
So we'll test them.
They'll be our guinea pigs.

756
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:05,797
I can't believe you're treating us
like guinea pigs…

757
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,759
According to Zeon Deikun,
the founder of the Principality of Zeon,

758
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,054
mankind will evolve to meet the needs
of the space age.

759
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:17,183
I find that entirely possible.

760
00:57:17,767 --> 00:57:20,562
So you're saying that our powers
of perception will expand,

761
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,772
-and we'll understand each other better?
-That's right.

762
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:27,902
Is increased perception linked
to an increase in piloting ability?

763
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,238
We're running these tests to find out.

764
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,115
Don't you find this inhuman?

765
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,575
No, I don't.

766
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:37,245
We have a sample by the name
of Chief Petty Officer Amuro.

767
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:38,288
Amuro?

768
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,376
Check over the Core Booster
once it's loaded into position!

769
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,714
So they built the Core Booster
and long-range weaponry, Lieutenant?

770
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,551
Right. And this keeps the costs down.

771
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:56,097
White Base's engines need to be tuned too.
Will there be enough time?

772
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,391
-I'll get them both done.
-But…

773
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,393
If we don't want to die,
it has to be done.

774
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,313
My crew will help.

775
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:23,708
Something's approaching security line 1!

776
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,752
-An enemy unit?
-Unknown!

777
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,296
-Mirai, can you start the engines?
-Yes, sir!

778
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,797
I want that unit identified.

779
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:32,091
Engines 1, 3, 4, 7…

780
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:33,760
It's an attack!

781
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,387
All clear!

782
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,473
Get Medea 3 out of White Base's way!

783
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,727
Tell Sayla that she may be sent out.

784
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,270
Sayla?

785
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,857
Forget about the engines that aren't
fixed! Just give me the usable ones!

786
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:54,072
They could send out Kai
or Hayato, or even Amuro…

787
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,663
Damn this body…

788
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:07,377
Just put electromagnetic coil tuners 38-52
into the blue zone!

789
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,711
This is just a scratch…

790
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:14,217
I don't mind having the control system
up top, but will it work okay?

791
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,762
Hayato, you going to be okay
flying solo from now on?

792
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,974
If you can do it, so can I!

793
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,311
They're all pretty much the same!

794
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,772
You could pilot the Gundam, right, Sayla?

795
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,315
-Are you being sarcastic?
-Hurry!

796
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:32,318
No! You're a Newtype too, aren't you?

797
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,904
Launch the Gundam immediately!

798
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:39,742
Tell the bridge to launch the Core Booster
if the situation warrants it!

799
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:42,370
Yes, ma'am! We'll hold off
on launching the Core Booster!

800
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:48,751
The power system gain
is 1.5 higher than the simulator.

801
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:49,711
Understood.

802
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:52,589
Do you really think I can do it?

803
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:56,092
If this isn't a Newtype experiment,

804
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,554
you'll be in serious trouble
for commandeering the Gundam.

805
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,308
General Revil is just trying to help you.

806
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,476
For a supply unit commander, you're…

807
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:06,561
Gundam, launch!

808
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:11,566
…surprisingly well-informed.

809
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:13,985
There's nothing organized
about military organizations.

810
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,614
People who can do everything
are worth their weight in gold.

811
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:22,452
Zeon Deikun's Newtypes
aren't just a bunch of handymen.

812
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:25,079
I know that.

813
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:28,041
-Should I have an expert look at that?
-Yes, ma'am!

814
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,792
Fraw Bow! Have Lieutenant Matilda

815
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:31,252
and Captain Seki
report to the bridge at once!

816
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,131
What's the matter with White Base?
Why haven't we lifted off?

817
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,634
Main engine output isn't rising.

818
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:38,551
What?

819
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,012
-Just follow Amuro!
-Yes, sir!

820
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:43,014
-How many enemy units are there?
-Three, sir!

821
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:47,977
To the left?

822
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,689
What?

823
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,830
This just isn't going to work…

824
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,631
Okay! Go!

825
01:01:23,721 --> 01:01:27,433
Where's that white bastard hiding?

826
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:33,981
The sync motor's fine?
That doesn't make sense.

827
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,525
Everything's fine here, too.

828
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,567
Recheck everything!

829
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,404
The other engines
can't reach criticality either?

830
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,530
That can't be right!

831
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,533
We might be a little late.

832
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,743
Why do you think that?

833
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,870
No reason. I just think so.

834
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,580
Why, Mirai?

835
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:52,500
What?

836
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,502
It's nothing.

837
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:59,382
You're a worrywart, aren't you?

838
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,344
I suppose. Everyone says so.

839
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,890
Amuro, Sayla… Kai, Hayato…

840
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:18,317
What's wrong with me?
I can't even slow this guy down!

841
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,031
-Captain Seki!
-Is it fixed?

842
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,158
Watch the left flank!

843
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,535
Pressure's come up on engines 2 and 3.

844
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,996
The rest are hopeless.
Their pressure's falling!

845
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:33,374
We've figured out the problem.
Give me three minutes.

846
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,917
Finish it in two!

847
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:41,048
A mobile suit?

848
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,481
Damn! Now they're attacking White Base!

849
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,905
This Federation suit isn't all that tough!

850
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,955
I won't let them damage White Base!
Not on my watch!

851
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,001
-Launch! Hurry!
-Yes, ma'am!

852
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:25,259
That damn suit!
Is it trying to destroy White Base first?

853
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,555
That damn pilot's a Newtype, all right!

854
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:33,935
Ortega! Mash! We're going to hit that suit
with a Jet Stream Attack!

855
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:41,692
Damn it! What's he up to?

856
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,670
It'll work!
Use the Jet Stream Attack again!

857
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:06,259
The Medea? Who's in it?

858
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,472
Damn!

859
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,395
He used me as a springboard!

860
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:26,904
Bastard!

861
01:04:54,098 --> 01:04:55,850
He took out Mash's Dom!

862
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,854
He slipped out of the Jet Stream Attack!
I can't believe it!

863
01:04:59,937 --> 01:05:01,063
Here come reinforcements!

864
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,442
You're not getting away!

865
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:08,863
Course clear!
Core Booster, launch when ready!

866
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,331
-I missed!
-Is that Sayla's Core Booster?

867
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,509
Mash… Ortega…
Destroyed by a single mobile suit…

868
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:39,477
And so, M'Quve's forces
were forced to retreat

869
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,605
in the face of the Federation's
overwhelming material superiority.

870
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:49,445
Towards the end of that fight,
a small unit found itself near White Base.

871
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:58,037
I only have one Zaku,
a Samson with four machine guns,

872
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,915
and my Magella Tops' three main cannons.

873
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:04,210
But the strength of 18 devoted men
will be enough.

874
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:10,800
Ramba Ral, I'll avenge your death,
and that of Lord Garma.

875
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,803
It's my way of thanking you
for the affection you showed me.

876
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,056
Allow me to do this for you.

877
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,187
And if that boy should try to interfere…

878
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:26,315
Darling, please watch over us.

879
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:31,737
It's not working. The Minovsky Craft
output isn't powerful enough.

880
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,573
Check the output of the main engine again!

881
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:38,452
Gundam! Go forward by 10km
and set up a perimeter!

882
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,038
What? Oh, right.

883
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:42,206
What's wrong?

884
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:43,416
Understood.

885
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,751
-Send out the Guncannon too!
-Yes, sir.

886
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,504
Where's Sayla?
What's the Core Booster's status?

887
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:50,548
Calm down, Bright.

888
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,884
You can replace the tread
on the Guntank, right?

889
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:56,095
That shouldn't be hard to fix.

890
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,973
I'm calm!

891
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,308
Operation Odessa is underway.

892
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,770
What's wrong with doing everything I can
to carry out our duties?

893
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:05,688
I get that, but still…

894
01:07:14,864 --> 01:07:17,241
I could've sworn I saw Matilda…

895
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,660
-I know I did…
-We're under attack?

896
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,038
-The Guntank's finally fixed!
-Amuro, what are you doing?

897
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:29,545
What? It's not just a Zaku?

898
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:38,554
Damn it, they didn't fix the engine!

899
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:45,061
Just as I expected, Trojan Horse.
You've been damaged.

900
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:52,026
What kind of unit is this?

901
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,661
Why? What am I fighting for?

902
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:07,208
The Guntank's malfunctioning?
Mirai! Can't we move White Base?

903
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:08,834
Damn it!

904
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,130
Ryu! You shouldn't be up!

905
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:16,717
I'm not going to call in sick
when White Base is being destroyed!

906
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,844
I guess you're right, but…

907
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,975
What are you fighting for, Matilda?

908
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,310
Good question.

909
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:31,482
I joined a supply unit
hoping I would be able to build something

910
01:08:31,565 --> 01:08:34,860
among all the death and destruction.

911
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:37,613
Zeon bastards!

912
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,576
Where's the boy?

913
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:44,537
It's her!

914
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,065
You won't let me kill myself, boy?

915
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,449
You'll never stop us all
with just your Gundam.

916
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,869
If I ram the Trojan Horse,
the explosives inside it…

917
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:28,205
Tachi! Finish off the Gundam from behind!

918
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,958
Lady Hamon!

919
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,340
From above? Will this work?

920
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:55,441
I expected nothing less from you.
But you can't stop us.

921
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:58,652
Damn!

922
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:07,286
No matter how much armor it has,
it can't withstand a shot at this range.

923
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:12,124
The blast from the Gundam and my cargo
will destroy the Trojan Horse!

924
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,417
Ms. Hamon?

925
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,378
I really liked you, boy.

926
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,174
Don't worry.

927
01:10:28,849 --> 01:10:30,935
-Ryu!
-What?

928
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:38,859
A Core Fighter? Who was in there?

929
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:07,763
There, unheeding of the life
and death of the soldiers in the rear,

930
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,432
both sides struggled
on the main battlefield.

931
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:13,686
The outcome of the war
won't be decided by this battle.

932
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:18,190
Just think, the resources
we sent Her Highness Kycilia

933
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:23,404
will allow Zeon
to fight for another ten years.

934
01:11:33,330 --> 01:11:35,374
What? What did I do?

935
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:40,337
Why didn't you stop him? Ryu was injured!

936
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,715
He ejected the top half
of the Guntank from outside

937
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:44,508
and got into the Core Fighter!

938
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,760
You could've stopped him!

939
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:48,887
With all those enemy units around?

940
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,139
-You're a soldier too, Hayato!
-Enough!

941
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,517
Stop it! Stop it, you two!

942
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,601
What good will this do?

943
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:01,650
You can't bring back the dead.

944
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:53,577
For all of the soldiers
we lost in Operation Odessa…

945
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:56,246
As an expression of our sorrow…

946
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:58,082
All hands! Salute!

947
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:30,280
I'm sorry I couldn't do better, Matilda…

948
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,260
Matilda…

949
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:53,178
Matilda…

950
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:56,098
Matilda…

951
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:02,438
Matilda!

952
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:57,201
Unknown warship sighted.
Will begin reconnaissance.

953
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:21,350
Message from 107.
A large warship has docked in Belfast.

954
01:15:22,559 --> 01:15:25,395
The photo's no good.
Too much noise from the jammers.

955
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,355
Let me see.

956
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,610
I can't tell from this.
Boone's unit is in that area, right?

957
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,570
-Yes, sir!
-Ready the Sealance!

958
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:35,531
Surface the Mad Angler
once you're sure it's clear.

959
01:15:48,085 --> 01:15:50,671
Surely Boone can handle this, sir?

960
01:15:50,754 --> 01:15:53,090
If it's the Trojan Horse,
I want to verify it myself.

961
01:15:53,173 --> 01:15:56,927
Lady Kycilia finds it amusing,
but I can be stubborn about some things.

962
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:59,888
Very well, sir. The Mad Angler
will be waiting here for you.

963
01:16:01,014 --> 01:16:01,848
Thanks, Mulligan.

964
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:12,150
I come across the Trojan Horse
right after I'm sent to the Mad Angler…

965
01:16:12,776 --> 01:16:14,069
I can't believe my luck.

966
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:22,327
According to their report,
external repairs will be done in a day.

967
01:16:23,036 --> 01:16:27,624
I'd prefer to give them a week off,
but we all know that's not possible..

968
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:32,421
What a pain…

969
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:34,715
Hey, soldier!
Would you like to buy something?

970
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,012
Really?
You're trying to sell me that crap?

971
01:16:40,095 --> 01:16:42,889
They're all local goods.
They're delicious!

972
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:46,393
You're cute. Looks like you're down
on your luck, though.

973
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:48,186
-Then buy something!
-Bye!

974
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,479
Tightwad!

975
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,233
-Buy something?
-No, thanks.

976
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:55,319
What do you want to do for fun this time?

977
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,571
Fraw? What's wrong?

978
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:58,780
It's nothing.

979
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,824
-Keep up the good work!
-At ease!

980
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:02,492
If you say so.

981
01:17:04,703 --> 01:17:05,579
Hey!

982
01:17:07,831 --> 01:17:10,667
-Where are they?
-They've been assembled, sir!

983
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:15,130
Stop that, you little--

984
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:16,798
Excuse me, sir!

985
01:17:17,674 --> 01:17:18,675
Attention!

986
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:21,970
Salute General Revil!

987
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:22,971
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

988
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:25,057
Just you wait!

989
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,183
Salute!

990
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,604
Thank you. Please, have a seat.

991
01:17:31,271 --> 01:17:32,731
At ease!

992
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:42,658
No words can express our gratitude
for your actions since you left Side 7.

993
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,036
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

994
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:53,210
You will leave here for Jaburo
to undergo Newtype testing.

995
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,545
I have a question, sir.

996
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:57,422
Could you explain what a Newtype is?

997
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:02,386
I think of them as people
with excellent intuition and insight.

998
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:05,097
But I don't know
if the military agrees with me.

999
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:07,557
The military?

1000
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,352
It's complicated.

1001
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:15,982
Even if human perception expands
due to a change in environment,

1002
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:18,985
we don't know how many people
are capable of evolving this way.

1003
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,237
Anything else?

1004
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:23,490
-I feel sick. May I be excused?
-Go ahead.

1005
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:26,952
General?

1006
01:18:27,035 --> 01:18:28,161
Yes?

1007
01:18:28,245 --> 01:18:31,707
About the children on board, sir…

1008
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:35,585
Jaburo has facilities to take them in.
There's nothing to worry about.

1009
01:18:36,837 --> 01:18:38,213
This ain't funny…

1010
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,385
They're planning on staying on this ship
for the rest of their lives.

1011
01:18:44,261 --> 01:18:46,847
The Gogg will reach the Trojan Horse
in 40 minutes.

1012
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:50,726
Good. After it launches,
we'll wait here for Captain Char.

1013
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,870
I bet it's true.

1014
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:11,371
I think so, too.

1015
01:19:15,041 --> 01:19:17,127
-Hurry up with the repairs.
-Yes, sir!

1016
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:18,336
-You too, Captain.
-Yes, sir!

1017
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:19,337
Kai!

1018
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:23,300
Kai! Where are you going?

1019
01:19:23,383 --> 01:19:28,263
Sorry, pal,
but being a soldier just isn't my thing.

1020
01:19:28,346 --> 01:19:29,264
-Kai?
-What?

1021
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,850
I'll admit that you grate
on my nerves sometimes.

1022
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:36,313
But we've been through so much together.
You're one of us!

1023
01:19:36,396 --> 01:19:39,065
That's nice of you, Amuro.

1024
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:40,484
Take care of yourself.

1025
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:42,486
Kai!

1026
01:19:42,569 --> 01:19:44,738
I've authorized his departure
under the pretext of shore leave.

1027
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:45,655
Let him go.

1028
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:49,493
Kai!

1029
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,292
That's the Captain, all right!
That guy's amazing!

1030
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:05,550
I've lost the signal from Area 22!
Go to alert status!

1031
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,472
I knew it!

1032
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:14,267
That's my Gogg! Shook it right off!

1033
01:20:14,351 --> 01:20:15,393
Freeze Gel, launch!

1034
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,870
Maybe I should offer my services
as an electrician.

1035
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:34,955
Hey, Mr. Soldier.

1036
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:36,790
You again?

1037
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:41,086
Why are you dressed like that?
Did they fire you?

1038
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,712
Something like that.

1039
01:20:42,796 --> 01:20:45,215
You don't have a place to stay, right?
Come over to my place.

1040
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,342
Are you sure?

1041
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,469
So? What's your angle?

1042
01:20:49,553 --> 01:20:52,222
Don't be silly. I'm just saying
you're welcome to stay for a few days.

1043
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,599
I'm Miharu.

1044
01:20:54,683 --> 01:20:57,269
My brother and sister live with me.
I hope you don't mind.

1045
01:21:05,735 --> 01:21:07,195
How long will you be in port?

1046
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:09,781
Worried about White Base?

1047
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:11,157
No, I like ships, that's all.

1048
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,078
Well, White Base may be a ship,
but it's a spaceship.

1049
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:17,455
I see.

1050
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,085
Yes?

1051
01:21:22,168 --> 01:21:24,421
Nothing. Never mind.

1052
01:21:24,504 --> 01:21:28,174
You must be tired.
I'll bring you a blanket.

1053
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:30,176
-What?
-Just make yourself at home.

1054
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:36,808
They taught her well.

1055
01:21:37,642 --> 01:21:41,271
If he goes outside,
tell me right away, okay?

1056
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:43,106
Okay.

1057
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,412
I knew it.

1058
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,127
-Sorry for the trouble.
-Don't worry about it.

1059
01:22:04,753 --> 01:22:07,213
White Base is leaving port tonight.

1060
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,635
The right engine's
still giving them some trouble.

1061
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:14,429
If the engine goes,
it'll have to stay here.

1062
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:16,556
Kai…

1063
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:17,807
Hey, don't sweat it.

1064
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:23,480
I know what it's like having to worry
about your younger siblings.

1065
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,735
These images were taken
by a Gogg on patrol.

1066
01:22:28,818 --> 01:22:30,612
That's the Trojan Horse, all right.

1067
01:22:30,695 --> 01:22:34,741
107 reports that she has made contact
with one of its crew members.

1068
01:22:34,824 --> 01:22:36,660
Reports say it's in Belfast, right?

1069
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:39,454
Have her sneak aboard the Trojan Horse
and find out where it's going.

1070
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:41,373
The civilian spy, sir?

1071
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:44,334
Yes. According to the rumors,
this is piloted by a Newtype.

1072
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:45,669
We need to know where it's headed,

1073
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:48,755
the African front
or Jaburo in South America.

1074
01:22:48,838 --> 01:22:50,131
Yes, sir!

1075
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,801
I want to find out for sure
and destroy it.

1076
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:57,722
Looks like I'll be able to sneak in.

1077
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,350
Captain Boone, I'd like some support fire.

1078
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:05,730
Make sure we're ready
to go to South America if necessary.

1079
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:09,150
It's time. Launch missiles!

1080
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:17,117
Missiles detected!

1081
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,243
In Area 22?

1082
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,411
No, Area 54!

1083
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,923
Launch Sayla's Core Booster!
The Guncannon should be good to go too!

1084
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:35,218
Yes, sir! Open the dock!
Prepare to launch Core Booster!

1085
01:23:35,885 --> 01:23:38,638
-We need a few more minutes!
-Get real, this thing won't move!

1086
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:40,265
They had to attack now?

1087
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:41,725
Damn it!

1088
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:43,977
Send out Connolly's boat!

1089
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:57,532
Hey! Where did your sister go?

1090
01:23:58,074 --> 01:24:01,578
-She'll be right back.
-She went shopping.

1091
01:24:02,579 --> 01:24:03,788
Really?

1092
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,582
It's true!

1093
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,252
Okay, I'll believe you.

1094
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,422
Are they attacking from the sea?

1095
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:16,926
He stole my bike!

1096
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:18,887
The army needs it! You'll get it back!

1097
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:24,809
Hello. Are you in a hurry?

1098
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:27,145
It's you?

1099
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,481
No, I'm in no real hurry.

1100
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:32,567
Why did you ask to meet here,
of all places?

1101
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:36,905
I'm new at this. I didn't think
someone like you would be our spy.

1102
01:24:39,657 --> 01:24:40,992
Here's your payment in gold.

1103
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:45,038
You're to sneak aboard the Trojan Horse
and find out where it's headed.

1104
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,289
How?

1105
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:50,460
That's up to you. Just sneak aboard.

1106
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:51,920
This is a lot.

1107
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:55,423
You'll do it, right? If you succeed,
there's more to where that came from.

1108
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:57,133
Here.

1109
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:02,305
There's a Federation uniform in there.
Papers from the ship's captain too.

1110
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:07,268
Okay, I'll do it.
I have my younger siblings to feed.

1111
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:09,479
How noble. Well, I'd better go.

1112
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:17,487
Here it comes. Looks like a bomber,
judging from the silhouette.

1113
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:21,116
Have the Gogg out there attack it.
Prepare for ground-to-air combat!

1114
01:25:29,415 --> 01:25:32,293
-You weren't scared, were you?
-Of course not!

1115
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:35,171
-Where is he?
-He left with his bags a while ago.

1116
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,090
Did he say anything?

1117
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,385
He said, "Hang in there."

1118
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,096
"Hang in there"?

1119
01:25:44,848 --> 01:25:45,974
Kai…

1120
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:51,187
Listen… I have a job to do.

1121
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:57,235
I might be gone for a while this time.
Use the money a little at a time.

1122
01:25:57,861 --> 01:26:00,196
Don't tell anyone where it is, okay?

1123
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,365
We'll be fine.

1124
01:26:05,535 --> 01:26:09,831
Once I'm done, the three of us
will go where there isn't any fighting.

1125
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,085
Stay strong. I know you two can do it.

1126
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,379
We'll be okay.

1127
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:20,216
Miharu?

1128
01:26:21,050 --> 01:26:23,303
You smell like Mom.

1129
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,433
Sorry, I didn't mean
to bring up old memories…

1130
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:43,531
Four o'clock aft!
A mobile suit just appeared!

1131
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:46,618
Hayato! What's the matter?
Go out in the Guncannon!

1132
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,537
I'm heading out now!
The beam rifle's ready, right?

1133
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:56,169
I just…

1134
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:57,921
Damn it!

1135
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:01,591
Why am I worried about White Base now?

1136
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,137
Isn't there something you should be doing?

1137
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:12,477
Coward!

1138
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:14,938
You call yourself a man?

1139
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:19,525
Yes… Maybe I am a coward.

1140
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:29,827
There!

1141
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:38,920
Can you fix it?

1142
01:27:39,003 --> 01:27:40,797
-I'll try!
-I'm counting on you!

1143
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,217
Stop! I'm with the military! Stop!

1144
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,512
Come pick it up at the base, okay?

1145
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,484
Where's the Gundam?
And where's the Guntank?

1146
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,199
It's right here! Why is it sitting here?

1147
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:11,995
Kai! Can you give me a hand?
The shaft repairs are finally complete!

1148
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:13,830
Hayato already launched in the Guncannon!

1149
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:16,165
Well, since you asked…

1150
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,509
It's hopeless! I've taken too many hits!
I'm losing power!

1151
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,139
The tank?

1152
01:28:33,516 --> 01:28:35,601
You've had fun long enough, pal!

1153
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:38,938
What the--

1154
01:28:46,821 --> 01:28:47,655
Bastard!

1155
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:15,308
I've sunk the Jukon!
No sign of the other ship.

1156
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,061
Back off!

1157
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:20,438
You're mine!

1158
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,212
First, find the wardroom.

1159
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:46,964
Find out where they're headed.

1160
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:50,218
Then find out whatever you can
about the Trojan Horse.

1161
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:55,014
Find the above information.
Make contact at 05:00 hours.

1162
01:29:59,393 --> 01:30:02,897
Captain Bright!
They need you on the bridge!

1163
01:30:09,403 --> 01:30:10,947
Is he up there already?

1164
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:14,659
What was that?

1165
01:30:16,536 --> 01:30:17,912
Did I tear something?

1166
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:26,337
Kai!

1167
01:30:29,215 --> 01:30:31,759
Don't scare me like that!
Who's down there?

1168
01:30:32,468 --> 01:30:34,470
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

1169
01:30:35,721 --> 01:30:38,266
What the heck? Miharu?

1170
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:39,976
Jeez!

1171
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:41,435
Come on!

1172
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,521
-I missed you.
-Liar.

1173
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:44,438
It's true!

1174
01:30:44,522 --> 01:30:45,731
Really? You missed me?

1175
01:30:47,066 --> 01:30:48,192
This is my room.

1176
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:52,405
Who was that?

1177
01:30:52,488 --> 01:30:54,157
None of your business, so don't ask.

1178
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:56,701
Your girlfriend?

1179
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:57,910
Something like that.

1180
01:30:57,994 --> 01:31:01,205
I'm dropping her off at Jaburo,
so keep this under your hat, okay?

1181
01:31:01,789 --> 01:31:02,665
Jaburo?

1182
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:05,418
Don't worry. I didn't see anything.

1183
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:06,502
Thanks!

1184
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,132
Don't leave the room.

1185
01:31:11,716 --> 01:31:14,594
Don't snoop around,
not until we get there.

1186
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:15,887
-All right.
-Good.

1187
01:31:21,058 --> 01:31:24,270
Civilian plane at four o'clock.
It's sending out an SOS.

1188
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:26,689
An SOS? Is it really a civilian plane?

1189
01:31:27,523 --> 01:31:28,649
Well, Fraw?

1190
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,068
Yes, sir. I have verification.

1191
01:31:32,904 --> 01:31:34,447
I checked the registration number.

1192
01:31:34,530 --> 01:31:36,782
It's registered
to the Verde Islands Fishing Union.

1193
01:31:37,450 --> 01:31:40,036
Okay. Tell them to come aboard
through the aft hatch.

1194
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:41,287
Yes, sir.

1195
01:31:50,546 --> 01:31:55,551
We're probably the first Zeons
to sneak aboard the Trojan Horse.

1196
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:56,802
Probably.

1197
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:59,430
Keep your mouth shut.
Your Zeon accent's too strong.

1198
01:31:59,513 --> 01:32:01,098
Yes, sir.

1199
01:32:01,182 --> 01:32:02,016
Thanks!

1200
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,727
Hurry up! It's going to ignite!

1201
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,356
We were out looking for fish,

1202
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:11,234
and a Zeon plane
started taking pot shots at us for fun.

1203
01:32:11,317 --> 01:32:13,611
-When was this?
-About 20 minutes ago.

1204
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:16,989
A dud 20mm slug did this, I bet.

1205
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:20,409
We'll patch you up
and give you enough fuel to make it home.

1206
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:21,369
I appreciate it.

1207
01:32:21,452 --> 01:32:24,413
But you have to stay in that room.
Everything else is off-limits.

1208
01:32:24,497 --> 01:32:27,458
I understand. Hey, Carioca!

1209
01:32:27,541 --> 01:32:30,336
I'll send the repair bill to your union.

1210
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:32,046
Keep it cheap, okay?

1211
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:37,885
I wonder if there's actually
someone around to take that bill?

1212
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,095
Good question.

1213
01:32:39,971 --> 01:32:41,097
Well, then…

1214
01:32:42,473 --> 01:32:43,516
Where's the toilet?

1215
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,602
-Down the hall, on the right.
-Thanks.

1216
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,731
There, on the right!
That's as far as you go.

1217
01:32:50,815 --> 01:32:52,441
I see it, thanks.

1218
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,777
Can't blame him for being curious.

1219
01:33:07,290 --> 01:33:08,124
There's the signal!

1220
01:33:08,207 --> 01:33:10,584
107! Answer if it's safe to talk.

1221
01:33:11,168 --> 01:33:14,088
-What's the Trojan Horse's destination?
-The spaceport at Jaburo.

1222
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,465
-Excellent. What else?
-I'm still working on it.

1223
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:17,717
Well done. Keep up the good work.

1224
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:19,510
That's better!

1225
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:24,598
What have you been up to?
Have you made contact?

1226
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:28,769
Don't you think it's strange
you can contact them from out here?

1227
01:33:29,562 --> 01:33:33,232
I guess. But it doesn't matter,
I have to do this to feed my family.

1228
01:33:34,233 --> 01:33:36,485
I get that. But still…

1229
01:33:37,570 --> 01:33:39,989
I'm making trouble for you, aren't I?
Me being a spy and all…

1230
01:33:40,072 --> 01:33:41,741
Well, yeah. Hey, wait a minute!

1231
01:33:42,616 --> 01:33:44,577
There's a civilian plane on board!

1232
01:33:44,660 --> 01:33:46,579
It's them!
You're talking to them by radio!

1233
01:33:47,747 --> 01:33:50,207
Damn it! Hold it!

1234
01:33:51,542 --> 01:33:53,169
They're spies! Shoot them down!

1235
01:33:53,794 --> 01:33:56,464
What are you talking about? They're just--

1236
01:33:56,547 --> 01:33:57,590
You idiot!

1237
01:34:00,968 --> 01:34:03,763
Looks like you were successful, Boone.

1238
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:08,809
So they're not going to the African front?

1239
01:34:08,893 --> 01:34:12,772
No. They're heading for the spaceport
at Jaburo. No doubt about it, sir.

1240
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:16,233
This is our chance.
While we're tailing the Trojan Horse,

1241
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:20,529
I can send our forces at California Base
and the African front to Jaburo.

1242
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:24,909
Please Captain.
Let me borrow a mobile armor.

1243
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:27,828
A Grublo? It's been prepped, but…

1244
01:34:28,454 --> 01:34:33,626
I don't want to say I'm out for revenge,
but I've lost three suits.

1245
01:34:33,709 --> 01:34:34,919
Let me do it.

1246
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:38,672
With a mobile armor, I can
catch the Trojan Horse, even from here.

1247
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:57,942
There are children here?

1248
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:00,528
How does it look?

1249
01:35:00,611 --> 01:35:02,655
Bad! You've been using
the Gundam too much!

1250
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,081
Where did the shells hit?

1251
01:35:12,164 --> 01:35:13,082
Deck 2!

1252
01:35:14,166 --> 01:35:15,751
Give me a damage report!

1253
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:18,087
That was a direct hit!

1254
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:20,881
Put on this survival gear!
Dying won't do anybody any good!

1255
01:35:20,965 --> 01:35:22,133
What about you?

1256
01:35:22,216 --> 01:35:23,551
We're being attacked!

1257
01:35:24,135 --> 01:35:25,553
Let me help!

1258
01:35:25,636 --> 01:35:27,471
There's nothing you can do to help!

1259
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,144
-This is all my fault!
-Hey…

1260
01:35:33,227 --> 01:35:36,689
I just leaked that information,
and now your ship is under attack!

1261
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:39,859
That information wouldn't
make them hit us like this.

1262
01:35:39,942 --> 01:35:43,696
I'm sorry, Kai! I've set you up!

1263
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:44,989
What?

1264
01:35:51,871 --> 01:35:53,539
Launch the Core Fighter ASAP!

1265
01:35:58,085 --> 01:35:58,919
There!

1266
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:08,762
All decks, damage report!

1267
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,264
What's keeping the Guncannon?

1268
01:36:11,348 --> 01:36:13,976
The catapult's been hit!
The Gunperry can make it out!

1269
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:17,313
Kai, go to deck 3!
We'll launch the Gunperry!

1270
01:36:17,396 --> 01:36:19,565
-Kai, get to deck 3!
-Don't follow me!

1271
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:25,863
You're not getting away, you bastard!

1272
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:37,291
He's mine!

1273
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:42,671
Godard's Z'gok!

1274
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:44,381
Bastard!

1275
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:45,883
I have you!

1276
01:36:51,055 --> 01:36:52,306
Activate fire extinguishers!

1277
01:36:58,521 --> 01:36:59,355
Damn!

1278
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:04,860
Are you okay?

1279
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:08,072
I'm okay! It'll take more than that!

1280
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:10,115
Don't cry over something like that!

1281
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:12,493
Kai, let me fight!

1282
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:16,372
I can't let these children die
to save my brother and sister!

1283
01:37:16,455 --> 01:37:19,291
Get it together! The fire isn't out yet!

1284
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:23,128
I have to break free from Zeon.
I'm done being their puppet!

1285
01:37:23,212 --> 01:37:26,882
I can't just stand by and watch anymore!

1286
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:28,133
But you can't--

1287
01:37:28,217 --> 01:37:30,261
Kai! Launch!

1288
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:32,221
Roger! Hey, what happened to Job?

1289
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:34,139
He can't leave the machine guns!

1290
01:37:34,723 --> 01:37:37,476
Come with me! I need a gunner!

1291
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:40,104
You can at least fire
a missile, can't you?

1292
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:41,438
Sure! Just tell me how!

1293
01:37:50,322 --> 01:37:54,243
Fire when the scope crosshairs
overlap with the enemy blip, okay?

1294
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,579
-Got it.
-Over there!

1295
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:03,335
I'm out of rounds and missiles!
He's all yours, Kai!

1296
01:38:03,419 --> 01:38:04,753
Roger!

1297
01:38:07,339 --> 01:38:10,426
Push the levers one at a time. Steady now!

1298
01:38:10,509 --> 01:38:11,427
Got it.

1299
01:38:15,097 --> 01:38:16,974
-Missed! Next!
-Okay.

1300
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:26,191
Miharu! Shoot!

1301
01:38:27,109 --> 01:38:28,652
I pushed the lever, but it's not firing!

1302
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,529
What? Why now?

1303
01:38:31,822 --> 01:38:35,451
It's useless! That blast just now
took out the power circuits!

1304
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:37,369
How can we destroy it?

1305
01:38:38,203 --> 01:38:40,664
We could pull the levers
beside the catapult.

1306
01:38:42,082 --> 01:38:43,917
Miharu! Where are you going?

1307
01:38:44,001 --> 01:38:46,462
The levers are by the catapult, right?

1308
01:38:47,463 --> 01:38:49,256
Miharu! It's too dangerous!

1309
01:38:55,554 --> 01:38:57,431
This must be it…

1310
01:38:58,015 --> 01:39:02,102
Miharu! You have to do it just right,
or it won't work! Understand?

1311
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:10,152
Kai! Keep it steady so I can aim!

1312
01:39:10,235 --> 01:39:12,404
Ready? Here he comes! Five! Four!

1313
01:39:13,197 --> 01:39:15,991
Kai! He's coming to us!

1314
01:39:35,386 --> 01:39:38,222
You did it! Miharu, you did it!

1315
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:51,860
Miharu? What's wrong?

1316
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:53,654
Get up here! Miharu!

1317
01:39:53,737 --> 01:39:55,739
Kai, be careful! Come back aboard!

1318
01:39:56,281 --> 01:39:57,241
Roger!

1319
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:05,165
Miharu's gone?

1320
01:40:05,249 --> 01:40:09,586
Yes. Kai says she went out with him
in the Gunperry.

1321
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,296
Who is she? Do you know her?

1322
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:13,132
No, sir. I've never heard of her.

1323
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:14,717
-How about you?
-No.

1324
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:24,685
She was a stowaway.

1325
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:25,602
A stowaway?

1326
01:40:26,270 --> 01:40:27,229
You knew about her?

1327
01:40:28,856 --> 01:40:29,815
Not really.

1328
01:40:29,898 --> 01:40:34,486
I saw a woman enter Kai's quarters,
but we were attacked right after, so…

1329
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:41,785
Miharu… I lost you…

1330
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,001
Miharu…

1331
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:59,303
Hey, don't cry. I'm glad I met you.

1332
01:41:01,013 --> 01:41:05,684
Gil and Milly? Those two will be fine.

1333
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:09,396
They're my kid brother
and sister, after all.

1334
01:41:09,980 --> 01:41:14,735
They'll be fine.
The world won't stay this way forever.

1335
01:41:14,818 --> 01:41:16,195
Right, Kai?

1336
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:21,533
What, you don't mind that you died?

1337
01:41:22,951 --> 01:41:25,579
Nothing good ever comes out of dying!

1338
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:30,918
I just wasn't lucky.

1339
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:36,632
I wanted to be with you, Kai.

1340
01:41:37,925 --> 01:41:40,469
Nothing good ever comes of dying…

1341
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:29,977
No doubt about it.
The Trojan Horse is headed for Jaburo.

1342
01:42:31,144 --> 01:42:34,147
Just as our spy has reported.
Don't let it get away.

1343
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:52,666
Butterflies!

1344
01:42:57,129 --> 01:42:58,463
Aren't they beautiful?

1345
01:42:58,547 --> 01:42:59,923
They're amazing…

1346
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:10,809
This is Jaburo? I don't see anything!

1347
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,227
Look!

1348
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:43,133
Landing completed.

1349
01:43:47,846 --> 01:43:49,097
I've lost the Trojan Horse!

1350
01:43:49,932 --> 01:43:53,727
Which means we've discovered
Jaburo's largest entrance.

1351
01:43:54,811 --> 01:43:57,564
I want a thorough search of the area
where we lost the signal!

1352
01:43:57,648 --> 01:43:59,524
Tell California Base
to prepare to scramble!

1353
01:44:04,738 --> 01:44:07,574
They're hurt pretty bad.
It's worse than they reported.

1354
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:12,496
White Base has seen
one battle after another.

1355
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:15,999
Okay! Begin inspection!

1356
01:44:16,959 --> 01:44:18,794
Begin inspection!

1357
01:44:18,877 --> 01:44:21,838
Teams 1 and 2, begin inspection!

1358
01:44:24,174 --> 01:44:29,972
Captain Woody? I'm Bright Noa,
the man in charge of White Base.

1359
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:32,015
Well done.

1360
01:44:32,975 --> 01:44:34,810
Is there a young man named Amuro Ray?

1361
01:44:34,893 --> 01:44:37,062
-Yes, sir. Amuro!
-Sir!

1362
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,899
-That's Amuro?
-Yes, sir.

1363
01:44:40,983 --> 01:44:42,859
He's just a boy!

1364
01:44:43,986 --> 01:44:44,861
Sir?

1365
01:44:45,696 --> 01:44:48,865
-I see, so you pilot the Gundam?
-Yes, sir.

1366
01:44:49,533 --> 01:44:51,243
Matilda told me about you.

1367
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:53,161
Lieutenant Matilda?

1368
01:44:59,918 --> 01:45:01,169
Thank you.

1369
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:04,631
Man, these physicals are a pain.

1370
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:06,008
No kidding.

1371
01:45:07,592 --> 01:45:10,887
Yours sure took a long time, Amuro.
I wonder if you have Newtype potential.

1372
01:45:11,722 --> 01:45:15,392
No, these guys have never
subscribed to the Newtype theory.

1373
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:17,227
Kai!

1374
01:45:17,811 --> 01:45:21,648
They said I'm perfectly healthy
in every possible way.

1375
01:45:22,315 --> 01:45:24,943
It's not like there are any
established Newtype standards.

1376
01:45:25,027 --> 01:45:26,528
Come back here!

1377
01:45:26,611 --> 01:45:27,821
Katz! Letz! Be quiet!

1378
01:45:28,405 --> 01:45:32,284
-There's nothing wrong with us!
-We're totally fine!

1379
01:45:32,367 --> 01:45:33,869
You don't seem to have cavities.

1380
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:41,835
-Excuse me, sir.
-Take care of it.

1381
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,254
Captain Woody.

1382
01:45:44,337 --> 01:45:45,172
Oh, Amuro.

1383
01:45:46,089 --> 01:45:47,883
Aren't you going to sleep?

1384
01:45:47,966 --> 01:45:49,968
Being a supervisor has its drawbacks.

1385
01:45:50,052 --> 01:45:52,345
Is there anything I can do to help?

1386
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:55,307
While you're here at Jaburo,
let us take care of things.

1387
01:45:56,016 --> 01:45:57,017
Thank you.

1388
01:45:58,435 --> 01:46:00,187
About you and Lieutenant Matilda…

1389
01:46:00,896 --> 01:46:05,609
We had planned to get married
after Operation Odessa.

1390
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:08,236
-Married?
-Yes.

1391
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:11,823
Matilda said she wanted to invite
the White Base crew to the ceremony

1392
01:46:11,907 --> 01:46:14,618
since you'd all be here at Jaburo.

1393
01:46:17,829 --> 01:46:21,541
Oh, I see. I didn't know.

1394
01:46:34,304 --> 01:46:36,515
I'm sorry, Captain Woody.

1395
01:46:38,433 --> 01:46:45,440
If I had been a better pilot,
Lieutenant Matilda would still be alive.

1396
01:46:46,566 --> 01:46:47,609
I'm sorry.

1397
01:46:48,485 --> 01:46:50,195
You think too highly of yourself.

1398
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:55,617
Don't try to tell me that the actions
of a single Gundam

1399
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:58,078
could have saved Matilda or ended the war.

1400
01:46:59,287 --> 01:47:00,455
But…

1401
01:47:00,539 --> 01:47:03,500
A pilot should give it
everything he's got during battle

1402
01:47:03,583 --> 01:47:06,586
and make sure he doesn't
regret his actions later.

1403
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:07,504
Yes, sir.

1404
01:47:08,922 --> 01:47:12,050
I love this White Base
that Matilda worked on.

1405
01:47:12,759 --> 01:47:14,886
So I'm doing everything I can
to repair it.

1406
01:47:16,346 --> 01:47:17,639
Yes, sir.

1407
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:19,850
That's all a man can do.

1408
01:47:30,235 --> 01:47:32,904
I found it! It's the entrance to Jaburo!

1409
01:47:32,988 --> 01:47:35,949
I would've missed it if it weren't
for that metallic signature.

1410
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:39,578
Do we attack, sir?

1411
01:47:39,661 --> 01:47:42,914
No, that would give away our location.
Hold your fire!

1412
01:47:42,998 --> 01:47:46,877
Two are underwater combat Goggs.
The one other isn't in the computer.

1413
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:48,670
A new mobile suit model?

1414
01:47:49,337 --> 01:47:53,133
The routine flight should be coming soon.
How's the south block look?

1415
01:47:55,635 --> 01:47:59,598
Regular Zeon bombing of south block
commencing on schedule.

1416
01:47:59,681 --> 01:48:00,932
Roger!

1417
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:04,436
What's the point in regular reports
from a remote outpost like ours?

1418
01:48:04,519 --> 01:48:09,524
Don't complain. They're flying patrols
to earn their pay, too.

1419
01:48:10,317 --> 01:48:11,151
What is it?

1420
01:48:41,973 --> 01:48:45,227
A scheduled enemy bombardment?
There's no need to worry.

1421
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:49,189
White Base's crew will remain as-is.

1422
01:48:49,272 --> 01:48:52,859
You are now the 13th Independent Unit
of the Tianem Fleet.

1423
01:48:55,528 --> 01:48:58,448
I will now hand out written orders
to each crewman.

1424
01:48:58,531 --> 01:49:00,533
-Lieutenant Bright Noa.
-Yes, sir!

1425
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,996
Ensign Mirai Yashima.

1426
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:05,914
Yes, sir!

1427
01:49:07,749 --> 01:49:09,501
-Warrant Officer Sayla Mass.
-Yes, sir!

1428
01:49:09,584 --> 01:49:11,795
What's the point
of these empty formalities?

1429
01:49:11,878 --> 01:49:13,755
Ensign Amuro Ray.

1430
01:49:13,838 --> 01:49:14,798
Yes, sir!

1431
01:49:18,510 --> 01:49:20,595
-Ensign Kai Shiden.
-Yes, sir!

1432
01:49:20,679 --> 01:49:22,597
Master Chief Petty Officer
Hayato Kobayashi.

1433
01:49:23,556 --> 01:49:27,102
The last time I got something like this
was when I graduated from grade school.

1434
01:49:28,728 --> 01:49:30,397
Seaman Fraw Bow. Is she here?

1435
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:31,898
No! I don't want to!

1436
01:49:31,982 --> 01:49:33,024
Come back here!

1437
01:49:35,735 --> 01:49:37,320
Excuse me.

1438
01:49:37,904 --> 01:49:40,031
No! We're not going anywhere!

1439
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:41,157
Yeah!

1440
01:49:41,241 --> 01:49:42,784
We're not going to leave!

1441
01:49:45,078 --> 01:49:46,288
What was that all about?

1442
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:51,167
Those kids refuse
to go to the childcare center.

1443
01:49:51,251 --> 01:49:52,294
What willful children!

1444
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:57,382
That's my specialty.
I'll try to talk them into it.

1445
01:49:57,465 --> 01:49:58,717
Come with me.

1446
01:49:58,800 --> 01:49:59,676
Yes, ma'am.

1447
01:50:00,510 --> 01:50:02,721
-Take your written orders!
-Yes, sir.

1448
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:08,059
Furthermore, Ryu Jose,
who died valiantly in battle,

1449
01:50:08,143 --> 01:50:11,313
shall receive a special
three-rank promotion to lieutenant.

1450
01:50:12,439 --> 01:50:18,111
Three ranks?
A three-rank promotion? That's it?

1451
01:50:23,908 --> 01:50:26,911
Is that all, sir?

1452
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:33,585
You can write off our dead
with just a three-rank promotion?

1453
01:50:33,668 --> 01:50:35,545
What? What are you saying?

1454
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:38,882
You didn't do anything for us
when we were fighting.

1455
01:50:38,965 --> 01:50:40,633
This promotion thing is stupid.

1456
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:44,220
The least you could do
is thank Ryu and the others!

1457
01:50:44,304 --> 01:50:45,638
Drop it, Amuro!

1458
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,182
Why, you little…

1459
01:50:49,517 --> 01:50:52,020
Why did you dodge, you little shit?

1460
01:50:52,103 --> 01:50:53,480
Do it again and I'll throw you in a cell!

1461
01:50:55,148 --> 01:50:59,944
You talk too much. Getting smacked
once in a while will do you some good.

1462
01:51:00,945 --> 01:51:03,490
All right already…

1463
01:51:03,573 --> 01:51:05,533
How are Kikka and the others doing?

1464
01:51:05,617 --> 01:51:08,244
The lady from the the childcare center
is looking for them.

1465
01:51:10,747 --> 01:51:14,918
But I wonder if those kids
will ever be happy here…

1466
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:16,878
We have to leave them here.

1467
01:51:17,629 --> 01:51:18,463
Why?

1468
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:23,051
Little kids shouldn't
see people killing each other.

1469
01:51:26,137 --> 01:51:27,263
Maybe you're right.

1470
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:37,857
The routine flights
have increased in frequency.

1471
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,610
Are you used to them yet, Mirai?

1472
01:51:40,693 --> 01:51:41,861
Yes, sir.

1473
01:51:42,445 --> 01:51:46,699
If your father were still alive,
this war would probably be over soon.

1474
01:51:47,283 --> 01:51:48,993
I'd rather you didn't talk
about my father, sir.

1475
01:51:49,661 --> 01:51:51,621
We're trying to do right by your father.

1476
01:51:51,704 --> 01:51:54,833
We don't know what to do with White Base,
not with someone like you on board.

1477
01:51:54,916 --> 01:51:56,418
But that's…

1478
01:51:56,501 --> 01:51:59,587
To get to the point,
because of your achievements,

1479
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:03,133
we made White Base the Newtype Unit

1480
01:52:03,216 --> 01:52:08,471
of the 13th Autonomous Corps
under the Tianem Fleet.

1481
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:10,557
Your primary duties will be
to provide a show of force.

1482
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:15,145
And so, once White Base's repairs
are completed, it will leave for space.

1483
01:52:17,105 --> 01:52:20,358
The Tianem Fleet
will go directly to Luna II,

1484
01:52:21,025 --> 01:52:26,114
so you will take a retrograde orbit
on a path to capture Solomon.

1485
01:52:26,197 --> 01:52:30,076
These orders aren't final.
You'll probably receive new orders later.

1486
01:52:33,913 --> 01:52:37,000
Be careful, Ensign Mirai.

1487
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:39,711
Thank you, Admiral.

1488
01:52:39,794 --> 01:52:41,004
Don't worry.

1489
01:52:41,087 --> 01:52:46,426
Once Solomon falls,
Zeon will come to us with a peace treaty.

1490
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:48,470
That would be the end of the war.

1491
01:52:48,553 --> 01:52:51,014
I hope you'll let me
find you a husband then.

1492
01:52:51,681 --> 01:52:52,849
Of course.

1493
01:52:52,932 --> 01:52:57,270
Oh, right. You have a fiancé.
Sorry about that.

1494
01:52:58,188 --> 01:52:59,606
No, it's…

1495
01:53:01,524 --> 01:53:04,360
He may be my fiancé,
but it was arranged by our parents.

1496
01:53:04,444 --> 01:53:05,987
Where is he?

1497
01:53:06,070 --> 01:53:08,865
I heard that he fled to Side 6
to avoid the war.

1498
01:53:09,657 --> 01:53:11,784
Things worked out for the best.

1499
01:53:11,868 --> 01:53:12,744
Right.

1500
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:26,633
Sir, they moved up our departure time.
Will the ship be ready?

1501
01:53:26,716 --> 01:53:30,011
Don't worry about it.
Our orders are always changing.

1502
01:53:33,223 --> 01:53:34,516
Welcome back!

1503
01:53:35,099 --> 01:53:38,394
We're finally going back into space.
Make sure every block is airtight!

1504
01:53:39,062 --> 01:53:42,315
Hey, where's the captain of White Base?

1505
01:53:42,398 --> 01:53:43,942
What do you want with him?

1506
01:53:44,025 --> 01:53:45,276
Where is he?

1507
01:53:45,360 --> 01:53:46,778
Lieutenant Bright! You have a visitor!

1508
01:53:47,445 --> 01:53:48,488
Who is it?

1509
01:53:49,113 --> 01:53:52,200
I'm Lieutenant Sleggar Law.
I was transferred here today.

1510
01:53:52,283 --> 01:53:53,868
Mirai, can you confirm this?

1511
01:53:56,037 --> 01:53:57,163
Here it is!

1512
01:53:58,331 --> 01:54:02,001
Man, am I lucky to be on the same ship
as a pretty lady like you!

1513
01:54:02,502 --> 01:54:04,546
I'm Ensign Mirai. Pleased to meet you.

1514
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:05,755
Pleasure's all mine.

1515
01:54:10,593 --> 01:54:11,970
Hello, miss.

1516
01:54:12,053 --> 01:54:13,304
I'm Sayla Mass.

1517
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:18,184
You look like
you're having trouble with a man.

1518
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:22,230
Where's my bunk?

1519
01:54:27,860 --> 01:54:31,072
Come back! Can't you hear me?

1520
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:36,286
Answer me! Kikka! Katz! Letz!

1521
01:54:46,504 --> 01:54:47,797
Someone's coming!

1522
01:54:48,506 --> 01:54:50,216
Hold it! It sounds like kids.

1523
01:54:52,260 --> 01:54:53,428
Come on, Kikka!

1524
01:54:55,388 --> 01:54:57,849
Katz, you're going to slip! Be careful!

1525
01:55:09,485 --> 01:55:10,486
Katz!

1526
01:55:10,570 --> 01:55:11,446
I'm coming.

1527
01:55:14,532 --> 01:55:15,909
That was close.

1528
01:55:16,534 --> 01:55:17,744
Captain Char…

1529
01:55:18,286 --> 01:55:20,288
The Federation's come this far?

1530
01:55:20,788 --> 01:55:23,124
Those are probably just part of it.

1531
01:55:24,751 --> 01:55:26,127
Impressive as ever, Captain.

1532
01:55:26,210 --> 01:55:27,712
No, the Federation Forces are.

1533
01:55:27,795 --> 01:55:30,465
-Team Ramsey will plant the bombs here.
-Yes, sir!

1534
01:55:30,548 --> 01:55:33,092
Team Akahana and I will head
for the Trojan Horse's dock.

1535
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:34,344
Yes, sir!

1536
01:55:36,137 --> 01:55:37,680
I can't go any farther!

1537
01:55:37,764 --> 01:55:39,974
-Hang in there, Kikka!
-I want to rest!

1538
01:55:40,058 --> 01:55:42,894
-Well, if you have to…
-Hey, this door is open!

1539
01:55:42,977 --> 01:55:43,895
Really?

1540
01:55:43,978 --> 01:55:46,522
Kikka, we'll rest in there for a while.

1541
01:55:46,606 --> 01:55:48,024
Then we'll go back to the ship.

1542
01:55:51,945 --> 01:55:53,655
How much longer?

1543
01:55:53,738 --> 01:55:55,239
Five minutes should do it.

1544
01:55:55,323 --> 01:55:56,741
Hold it! Hide!

1545
01:55:58,534 --> 01:56:00,244
-It smells in here!
-It's deserted.

1546
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:01,913
Look! Gundam!

1547
01:56:01,996 --> 01:56:05,708
-Wow!
-Wow! There are lots of them!

1548
01:56:07,168 --> 01:56:09,545
It's a little different from the Gundam.

1549
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:13,257
Now that you mention it,
they're a lot different.

1550
01:56:13,341 --> 01:56:14,592
-Down by its foot!
-What?

1551
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:16,844
Something moved!

1552
01:56:17,428 --> 01:56:19,847
You're imagining things.
I can't see anything.

1553
01:56:19,931 --> 01:56:25,186
But it's true! I saw something move!
It might've been a person!

1554
01:56:25,269 --> 01:56:27,230
A person? If it is, it's bad news!

1555
01:56:27,313 --> 01:56:28,314
Let's hide!

1556
01:56:32,735 --> 01:56:34,153
This way!

1557
01:56:35,947 --> 01:56:38,282
The center should've called by now.

1558
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:42,412
They haven't returned to White Base.
They're wandering around somewhere…

1559
01:56:43,788 --> 01:56:45,415
That woman's from the center!

1560
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:49,210
Just the people I wanted to see!
I still can't find Kikka and the others!

1561
01:56:49,919 --> 01:56:52,463
I've set them to blow in 30 minutes.

1562
01:56:52,547 --> 01:56:53,548
Good. Let's go.

1563
01:57:15,903 --> 01:57:16,821
Bombs!

1564
01:57:23,578 --> 01:57:25,329
I'll go look for Katz, Letz, and Kikka.

1565
01:57:25,413 --> 01:57:26,706
-Roger.
-Is there a car?

1566
01:57:26,789 --> 01:57:27,749
Yeah!

1567
01:57:27,832 --> 01:57:29,208
-Mirai! Sayla!
-Captain?

1568
01:57:30,043 --> 01:57:32,795
They might be nearby.
I'd like you to go find them.

1569
01:57:33,379 --> 01:57:35,131
-Can you do that, Sayla?
-Yes, ma'am.

1570
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:37,258
Mirai out.

1571
01:57:38,968 --> 01:57:40,845
Got it! Katz! Hurry!

1572
01:57:40,928 --> 01:57:41,971
You're a lifesaver…

1573
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:44,057
We've got to find the bombs!

1574
01:57:45,683 --> 01:57:47,977
-You and Kikka look underneath these!
-Okay!

1575
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:56,235
See any?

1576
01:57:57,904 --> 01:57:59,030
No!

1577
01:57:59,697 --> 01:58:00,865
What do we do?

1578
01:58:00,948 --> 01:58:03,659
I found one! This is a bomb, right?

1579
01:58:08,456 --> 01:58:09,957
Hurry up, Kikka!

1580
01:58:18,966 --> 01:58:20,176
How many went up?

1581
01:58:20,259 --> 01:58:22,678
It's hard to tell.
There were at least four, so…

1582
01:58:23,346 --> 01:58:26,182
One must have been real
while the others are just decoys…

1583
01:58:26,891 --> 01:58:29,393
Here they come!
Go to level 1 battle stations!

1584
01:58:42,740 --> 01:58:44,784
How do you know they're out here?

1585
01:58:45,451 --> 01:58:46,786
It's just a hunch.

1586
01:58:46,869 --> 01:58:49,539
Amuro's a Newtype! A Newtype!

1587
01:58:49,622 --> 01:58:51,082
Stop making fun of me, okay?

1588
01:58:51,165 --> 01:58:51,999
Yes, sir!

1589
01:58:56,337 --> 01:58:59,048
Okay, it started! What next?

1590
01:58:59,132 --> 01:59:00,424
Right, I'll pull this!

1591
01:59:03,886 --> 01:59:04,762
Wrong way!

1592
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,399
Katz, Letz, and Kikka were in that car!

1593
01:59:16,482 --> 01:59:19,402
-What the heck are they doing down here?
-After them!

1594
01:59:24,073 --> 01:59:25,283
Stop the car!

1595
01:59:25,867 --> 01:59:27,201
Can't you stop?

1596
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:31,164
Zeon planted some bombs!
We're going to throw them away!

1597
01:59:31,247 --> 01:59:32,540
Bombs?

1598
01:59:32,623 --> 01:59:33,583
Those are…

1599
01:59:33,666 --> 01:59:36,627
Hey, Amuro! They're telling the truth!
They're time bombs!

1600
01:59:37,378 --> 01:59:38,212
Where were they?

1601
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:40,590
Inside the Gundam factory!

1602
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:44,719
Okay, Letz, I'll take it from here.
Get into the other car. Hurry!

1603
01:59:45,761 --> 01:59:47,847
Kai! Get the kids into the other car!

1604
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:50,516
I'm on it! Okay, Letz! You first! Come on!

1605
01:59:53,561 --> 01:59:54,729
See? You're okay!

1606
01:59:54,812 --> 01:59:56,397
Your turn, Kikka! Come on!

1607
01:59:57,565 --> 01:59:58,733
Okay, next! There we go!

1608
02:00:00,067 --> 02:00:02,028
Hey, you did great! I got them, Amuro!

1609
02:00:02,612 --> 02:00:04,447
Thanks, Kai!

1610
02:00:09,827 --> 02:00:11,204
Amuro!

1611
02:00:11,287 --> 02:00:12,830
-Jump!
-Jump!

1612
02:00:31,641 --> 02:00:33,851
-We did it!
-We did it!

1613
02:00:33,935 --> 02:00:35,269
White Base is in danger!

1614
02:00:35,353 --> 02:00:38,606
The people who planted those
are probably heading for the space dock!

1615
02:00:53,204 --> 02:00:55,122
We failed to get to the Trojan Horse.

1616
02:00:55,831 --> 02:00:57,500
Ivanov, do you read me?

1617
02:00:57,583 --> 02:00:59,210
I read you, Captain!

1618
02:00:59,835 --> 02:01:02,713
Escape in the Acguy! We'll catch up later.

1619
02:01:02,797 --> 02:01:04,548
-Roger!
-Let's go!

1620
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:30,866
Launch all our units
once the pilots return!

1621
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:31,951
Yes, sir!

1622
02:01:32,034 --> 02:01:33,286
Decks one and two!

1623
02:01:36,205 --> 02:01:41,502
Katz! Kikka! Letz!

1624
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:45,423
Katz! Letz! Kikka!

1625
02:01:47,091 --> 02:01:48,050
Artesia!

1626
02:01:54,265 --> 02:01:55,182
Hello.

1627
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:07,737
I can't believe you joined the Zeon army.

1628
02:02:08,571 --> 02:02:10,948
Not my sweet brother, Casval…

1629
02:02:11,032 --> 02:02:14,744
Leave the Federation Forces, Artesia.

1630
02:02:16,746 --> 02:02:18,622
Sayla! Are you there? Answer me!

1631
02:02:18,706 --> 02:02:19,915
-Think about it!
-Casval!

1632
02:02:22,626 --> 02:02:23,878
Sayla!

1633
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:27,673
Where are you? Kikka!

1634
02:02:28,424 --> 02:02:29,342
Sayla!

1635
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:32,470
Was that a gunshot?
Is there a Zeon soldier around?

1636
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:36,932
What do you mean?
The Zeon commander was right there!

1637
02:02:37,808 --> 02:02:38,893
You didn't see him?

1638
02:02:39,727 --> 02:02:43,189
No, sorry. Maybe we shouldn't go that way.

1639
02:02:48,110 --> 02:02:49,653
-See you!
-Good luck!

1640
02:03:04,543 --> 02:03:05,961
Akahana!

1641
02:03:20,226 --> 02:03:21,310
Can we make it down there?

1642
02:03:33,614 --> 02:03:37,993
-They dropped 28 mobile suits.
-That's a fairly large group.

1643
02:03:38,077 --> 02:03:41,872
Perhaps, but it's too small
to attack Jaburo.

1644
02:03:42,581 --> 02:03:45,418
They're only after A-Block
of the space dock.

1645
02:03:46,001 --> 02:03:48,379
Did they follow White Base here?

1646
02:03:48,462 --> 02:03:53,592
Probably.
White Base is nothing but trouble.

1647
02:03:55,386 --> 02:03:57,346
Just one tank will do! Send one over here!

1648
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:59,014
We're practically defenseless!

1649
02:03:59,098 --> 02:04:00,391
Sorry I took so long!

1650
02:04:00,474 --> 02:04:02,810
-Activate the main engine!
-Yes, sir!

1651
02:04:03,394 --> 02:04:04,895
All right!

1652
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:06,856
Guntank, launching!

1653
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:09,316
Guncannon, stand by for launch on deck 2!

1654
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:12,486
I won't be sad anymore, Miharu.

1655
02:04:12,570 --> 02:04:15,156
I'll destroy Zeon
so there won't be any more girls like you.

1656
02:04:15,239 --> 02:04:16,449
I'll wipe them out!

1657
02:04:25,583 --> 02:04:27,960
Amuro, Gundam! Here I go!

1658
02:04:41,849 --> 02:04:43,434
How many enemy units got through?

1659
02:04:51,358 --> 02:04:52,485
They're here!

1660
02:04:57,823 --> 02:04:59,116
Here they come!

1661
02:04:59,200 --> 02:05:01,535
Zeon made it past our defenses?

1662
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:03,329
Have the workers
take up defensive positions too!

1663
02:05:03,412 --> 02:05:04,246
Yes, sir!

1664
02:05:04,955 --> 02:05:08,417
I won't let them scratch White Base now
that I've run the pressure checks.

1665
02:05:16,967 --> 02:05:18,344
Don't mess with me!

1666
02:05:27,686 --> 02:05:29,188
You won't lay a finger
on the ship Matilda protected!

1667
02:05:33,692 --> 02:05:35,611
Fall back!

1668
02:05:43,911 --> 02:05:47,122
You can't do anything in a hovercraft!
Fall back, Captain Woody!

1669
02:05:49,458 --> 02:05:50,292
Captain!

1670
02:05:54,213 --> 02:05:55,923
A red mobile suit!

1671
02:05:56,674 --> 02:05:58,050
Is that Char?

1672
02:06:06,392 --> 02:06:07,476
It's fast!

1673
02:06:17,278 --> 02:06:21,156
It's him, all right. He's here.

1674
02:06:35,296 --> 02:06:36,171
Is that you, Char?

1675
02:06:36,755 --> 02:06:39,049
You've gotten better, Gundam!

1676
02:06:46,807 --> 02:06:47,933
Nice!

1677
02:06:50,352 --> 02:06:52,104
If I hit him with a missile
at point-blank…

1678
02:06:52,771 --> 02:06:54,064
Captain Woody! It won't work!

1679
02:06:54,732 --> 02:06:55,691
You must be joking.

1680
02:07:04,783 --> 02:07:06,076
Char!

1681
02:07:18,964 --> 02:07:20,883
Was my balance off?

1682
02:07:21,425 --> 02:07:22,718
You're not getting away!

1683
02:07:31,685 --> 02:07:34,146
This pilot, the source of this pressure…

1684
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:35,481
Who is he?

1685
02:07:38,025 --> 02:07:39,276
An underground river!

1686
02:07:55,584 --> 02:07:56,627
Damn you, Char!

1687
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:13,936
That's just like him.
He ran away while I was pinned.

1688
02:08:25,197 --> 02:08:28,575
I understand how you feel.

1689
02:08:28,659 --> 02:08:32,287
But are you sure?
You'll be safe if you stay here.

1690
02:08:33,163 --> 02:08:35,582
They'll be at the mercy of bureaucrats.

1691
02:08:35,666 --> 02:08:39,211
Don't the children get a say in this?

1692
02:08:41,004 --> 02:08:47,761
These kids are survivors.
They've fought with us in every battle.

1693
02:08:48,345 --> 02:08:51,306
They've been through hell and back.

1694
02:08:51,390 --> 02:08:53,892
They've seen things you can't imagine.

1695
02:08:53,976 --> 02:08:56,729
Don't you get it?
They don't want to leave.

1696
02:08:56,812 --> 02:08:58,731
You want to stay with us, right?

1697
02:08:58,814 --> 02:09:00,899
-Yeah!
-But…

1698
02:09:08,532 --> 02:09:13,203
Maybe you're right.
I'll make the necessary arrangements.

1699
02:09:13,287 --> 02:09:17,040
-That's great!
-I'm so happy for you!

1700
02:09:18,208 --> 02:09:21,378
-We can stay with you!
-I'm glad it worked out.

1701
02:09:22,212 --> 02:09:23,547
Isn't that great?

1702
02:09:27,509 --> 02:09:31,722
Soon afterwards,
the Earth Federation Chiefs of Staff

1703
02:09:31,805 --> 02:09:37,770
determined that Zeon was overestimating
the real potential of White Base.

1704
02:09:37,853 --> 02:09:42,316
Therefore, they entrusted the duties
of the 13th Autonomous Corps

1705
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:44,151
to White Base alone.

1706
02:09:45,194 --> 02:09:49,865
This was presented as a privilege
given only to the esteemed Newtype Unit.

1707
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:56,497
You're saying that White Base
is to specialize in being a decoy?

1708
02:10:17,100 --> 02:10:18,477
Skies are clear!

1709
02:10:19,311 --> 02:10:21,772
White Base, lift off!

1710
02:10:46,797 --> 02:10:49,550
-Wow! Birds!
-Pretty!

1711
02:10:55,639 --> 02:10:58,016
Anyone who's not busy,
look out the portside windows.

1712
02:10:58,100 --> 02:11:00,978
-There's a flock of flamingos.
-I'll get it on video!

1713
02:11:01,061 --> 02:11:02,354
You have my permission.

1714
02:11:31,049 --> 02:11:33,051
Char's mobile suit?

1715
02:11:33,135 --> 02:11:34,720
Yes. It was him, all right.

1716
02:11:35,429 --> 02:11:37,347
Char? The Red Comet?

1717
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:39,766
Is he really that good?

1718
02:11:40,809 --> 02:11:41,977
Casval…
