1
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,995
Is that you, Samuel?

2
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:35,869
Yes...
Yes, my bun, it's only me.

3
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,337
Is the...

4
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,549
Is the...

5
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:04,829
Is the dinner
on the table, dear?

6
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:06,562
On the table and off,

7
00:04:06,636 --> 00:04:07,728
five hours ago!

8
00:04:07,804 --> 00:04:09,032
Don't exaggerate.

9
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,663
It's only the shank
of the evening.

10
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,934
Half past eight.

11
00:04:12,008 --> 00:04:14,476
<i>MAN ON RADIO.; We will now give you
the correct time. Half past eight.</i>

12
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:16,910
<i>When you hear the sound of
the gong, it will be exactly...</i>

13
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,948
8:30.
Take off your hat!

14
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,008
Where have you been?

15
00:04:21,284 --> 00:04:23,718
Don't answer! I know
what you're going to say.

16
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:26,277
"Down at the shop,
working on an invention."

17
00:04:26,356 --> 00:04:27,948
If you was married
to Thomas Edison...

18
00:04:28,024 --> 00:04:29,924
You're no Edison,
Sam Bisbee.

19
00:04:29,993 --> 00:04:32,257
No, and you're no prophet,
Mrs. Bisbee.

20
00:04:32,328 --> 00:04:33,454
If you've no regard for me,

21
00:04:33,529 --> 00:04:35,997
you might at least have some regard
for your daughter's happiness.

22
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:38,625
My daughter's the happiest
little girl in the world.

23
00:04:38,701 --> 00:04:41,568
Her silvery laughter rings out
from early morn

24
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:44,368
till late at night.
Till late at night.

25
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,431
Yeah.
Yes, very late.

26
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:47,874
But not in her own home,
it doesn't...

27
00:04:47,944 --> 00:04:49,468
Take those shoes
off the table.

28
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:51,376
Who was putting them
on the table?

29
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:55,181
Where is she now?
What's she doing?

30
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:56,684
Who's she with?

31
00:04:56,753 --> 00:04:58,721
I don't have to worry
about my daughter.

32
00:04:58,788 --> 00:05:00,483
Well,
you'd better worry.

33
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:03,525
She wouldn't be out if she wasn't
ashamed of her home, ashamed of you.

34
00:05:03,593 --> 00:05:05,151
Me?
Look at you.

35
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:07,226
Suppose she were entertaining
a nice young man in her home,

36
00:05:07,297 --> 00:05:09,060
and you came in
looking like that,

37
00:05:09,132 --> 00:05:10,997
with your shoes off,
your suspenders down,

38
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,762
and your breath
smelling of cheap liquor.

39
00:05:12,835 --> 00:05:15,201
Cheap? Four dollars a gallon.

40
00:05:16,172 --> 00:05:18,367
My daughter ashamed
of my suspenders?

41
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:20,409
There she is now
with that Bob Murchison,

42
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:21,907
that no-good...

43
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:24,576
What did I tell you?

44
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,308
I forgot.
What? Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:27,784 --> 00:05:29,251
Kissing him.
Kissing who?

46
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:31,344
Bob Murchison.
Who's kissing Bob Murchison?

47
00:05:31,421 --> 00:05:32,945
Pauline, our...

48
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:38,260
Well, that's life, dear.

49
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:40,228
Girls will be girls.

50
00:05:40,296 --> 00:05:43,697
When I was a little boy,
I used to kiss little girls.

51
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:48,763
A rich man's son making
a fool of your daughter,

52
00:05:48,838 --> 00:05:50,328
and you stand there.

53
00:05:50,473 --> 00:05:54,705
No rich man's son will ever make
a fool of Sam Bisbee's daughter.

54
00:05:55,044 --> 00:05:57,604
You might as well
get that in your...

55
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,277
That's the...
Take off that hat!

56
00:06:03,353 --> 00:06:04,684
I'm sorry.

57
00:06:14,364 --> 00:06:17,094
There. There they are, right in my hand.

58
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:19,293
Good night, Bob.

59
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,369
I know how to solve
our problem.

60
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:26,931
No, no, Bob.

61
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:29,639
You won't elope with me?

62
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,469
No.

63
00:06:32,081 --> 00:06:33,548
You won't let me
elope with you?

64
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,972
No.

65
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:39,144
What's keeping us apart?

66
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:41,384
Haven't you heard?

67
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,122
The railroad tracks.

68
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:55,034
Twenty years married to a man
like you is enough for any woman...

69
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:56,298
Give him a rest, Mom.

70
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:59,000
Say, you little night owl.

71
00:06:59,308 --> 00:07:01,674
What do you mean by staying
out the middle of the...

72
00:07:03,046 --> 00:07:05,708
The middle of half past eight? Who, me?

73
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:08,273
Yes, you. Running
around with that clown.

74
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:09,716
Never let it
be said that...

75
00:07:09,786 --> 00:07:12,016
Hey, you left your gadget
on the doorknob.

76
00:07:13,956 --> 00:07:16,447
Your father and I think this thing
between you and that Murchison boy

77
00:07:16,526 --> 00:07:17,686
has gone far enough.
Yes.

78
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,920
He doesn't seem to think so.

79
00:07:18,995 --> 00:07:20,826
He just asked me
to marry him.

80
00:07:20,897 --> 00:07:23,161
Marry him? Darling.

81
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,959
Hey, didn't I tell you?
I knew it all the time.

82
00:07:26,035 --> 00:07:27,229
Oh, shut up!

83
00:07:27,303 --> 00:07:29,464
He really wants to
marry you? Well, why not?

84
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,372
I'm young and healthy and
full of the devil. Pauline!

85
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:33,841
Sure,
my little daughter

86
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:36,105
doesn't have to be in a
hurry to marry any man.

87
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,113
Pick and choose, dear.

88
00:07:38,614 --> 00:07:40,343
Liberty is sweet.

89
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,907
Once you're married,
it's just like being in jail.

90
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,055
I guess I'll go to bed.

91
00:07:48,758 --> 00:07:49,986
Look out!

92
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:51,754
Don't get tangled up
in that thing again.

93
00:07:51,828 --> 00:07:54,262
I won't get tangled up
in nothing.

94
00:08:03,473 --> 00:08:05,236
I'm going upstairs.

95
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:09,642
It's worse than flypaper.

96
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:13,808
Might as well have some flypaper
curtains in the house as that...

97
00:08:37,874 --> 00:08:39,671
You know, Charlie,
I've been thinking about...

98
00:08:39,742 --> 00:08:42,040
Look out!
Don't sit down there.

99
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,443
That's another
of my inventions.

100
00:08:44,514 --> 00:08:46,846
It's what I call
the "murder chair."

101
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,441
When a burglar comes in here
and says, "Stick 'em up,"

102
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,044
I get friendly with him.
I say, "Have a drink."

103
00:08:52,121 --> 00:08:54,282
Then I invite him
to sit down in the chair.

104
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:57,588
When he sits in the chair
he releases that lever.

105
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,252
The iron ball comes up

106
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,353
and smites him
upon the sconce,

107
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:05,323
thus knocking him
deader than a doornail.

108
00:09:05,635 --> 00:09:07,466
Now, don't either of you boys
ever sit in that chair.

109
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,437
Put that down,
will you, Doc?

110
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:12,472
Soon as I get this tire on the market,
I'll sell a lot of these things.

111
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:13,907
How's the tire coming,
Sam?

112
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:15,466
Coming? It's perfected.

113
00:09:15,545 --> 00:09:17,137
Get over there, and I'll
give you a demonstration.

114
00:09:17,213 --> 00:09:18,373
Get over, Doc.

115
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:26,715
Now, give that wheel a spin.

116
00:09:27,957 --> 00:09:30,221
Good. Now, stand clear, boys.

117
00:09:41,904 --> 00:09:44,202
That's a puncture-proof tire.

118
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:45,865
Say, that's pretty good.

119
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:48,575
Pretty good? It's perfect!

120
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:52,080
I've got nothing to worry about
now for the rest of my life.

121
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,928
Hello.
Hello.

122
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:10,522
Do I work fast?

123
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,831
My mother is calling on your
mother this afternoon at 4:00.

124
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:15,962
But, Bob, why?
What happened?

125
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:18,734
Well, after what you said
last night about my family,

126
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:21,003
I decided to have it out
with them. I know, darling.

127
00:10:21,077 --> 00:10:23,068
But why does she have
to call on us today?

128
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,837
What'd you say to her?

129
00:10:24,914 --> 00:10:26,279
Nothing much.

130
00:10:26,349 --> 00:10:28,579
I merely said I was going
to marry Pauline Bisbee.

131
00:10:28,651 --> 00:10:30,414
You did?
I did.

132
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:32,582
And I am.

133
00:10:32,788 --> 00:10:34,881
Mother's very much
interested in meeting you.

134
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:36,424
I'll bet she is.

135
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:38,357
Well, I'd better go
and break the news,

136
00:10:38,427 --> 00:10:40,452
and if you see ten women
being carried out of here

137
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:43,362
kicking and screaming,
that'll be my mother.

138
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:44,995
Goodbye.

139
00:10:47,036 --> 00:10:48,936
Howdy, boys!
Hello, Bill.

140
00:10:49,005 --> 00:10:50,870
Say, Sam, I got
a special delivery.

141
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,340
Registered airmail letter,
here, for you.

142
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,070
Sam. Sam.

143
00:10:59,048 --> 00:11:00,413
What's the matter with him?

144
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,451
Sound sleeper,
that's all.

145
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,319
Hey, Sam!

146
00:11:09,158 --> 00:11:11,149
Registered letter.
Sign for it.

147
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:15,356
Sign for me, will you, Doc?

148
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:27,972
She didn't work out as well
as I thought she would.

149
00:11:28,944 --> 00:11:31,435
Ought to put
a heavier ball on there.

150
00:11:43,893 --> 00:11:45,554
"Samuel Bisbee...

151
00:11:46,762 --> 00:11:48,195
"Dear sir.

152
00:11:48,264 --> 00:11:52,928
"Your letter, at hand, regarding
your Bisbee Puncture-Proof Tire.

153
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:57,566
"If you care to demonstrate
your invention to our company,

154
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,872
"the Board will meet you
Saturday, June 12, at 2:00,

155
00:12:01,944 --> 00:12:03,673
"in our main office."

156
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,043
That's great, Sam!

157
00:12:05,114 --> 00:12:07,776
Yes, I guess I finally
put one over. Yes, sir.

158
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,579
Come on, Charlie,
help me get this tire off.

159
00:12:22,198 --> 00:12:24,063
Mrs. Bisbee?
I'm Mrs. Murchison.

160
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,259
How do you do?

161
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:28,261
Won't you come in, please?
Thank you.

162
00:12:28,337 --> 00:12:30,771
So nice of you to call,
Mrs. Murchison. Not at all.

163
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,705
I'm sure you understand
why I'm here.

164
00:12:32,775 --> 00:12:34,709
My daughter told me
you were coming.

165
00:12:34,777 --> 00:12:36,972
It's about your daughter I've
come to see you, Mrs. Bisbee.

166
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:39,378
I suppose you already know
that my son,

167
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:41,575
who is very young
and unsophisticated,

168
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:44,881
has been... Shall I
say, taken in by her?

169
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:46,188
Has been what?

170
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:48,018
Well, fascinated by her.

171
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,115
Now he even talks of
wanting to marry her.

172
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:54,185
Of course, with his social position,
his family and his future...

173
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,695
In short, the whole affair's
absurd, and I've come to...

174
00:12:56,766 --> 00:13:00,759
And why is it absurd that your son
should want to marry my daughter?

175
00:13:00,936 --> 00:13:04,428
The women of the Warren family
have always been above reproach.

176
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:06,302
That is history.

177
00:13:06,575 --> 00:13:07,599
The Warren family?

178
00:13:07,676 --> 00:13:10,372
You don't mean
the Warrens of Virginia?

179
00:13:10,446 --> 00:13:13,847
My grandfather was General
Robert Henry Warren of Virginia.

180
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:15,383
Not really!

181
00:13:15,451 --> 00:13:17,919
There,
you can see for yourself.

182
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:20,182
Well, this is a surprise.

183
00:13:20,256 --> 00:13:21,951
Of course,
you wouldn't recognize me.

184
00:13:22,024 --> 00:13:23,889
I'm the baby on his lap.

185
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:27,918
That was taken on the veranda of
our old homestead in Warrenton.

186
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:32,260
You're sure this album
belongs to you?

187
00:13:33,702 --> 00:13:36,637
Quite sure.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

188
00:13:36,872 --> 00:13:39,432
Then your daughter Pauline
is really a Warren!

189
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:41,806
Well, of course,
that puts the whole affair

190
00:13:41,877 --> 00:13:43,242
in an entirely
different light.

191
00:14:31,927 --> 00:14:33,724
You all right, boy?
Yeah.

192
00:14:35,431 --> 00:14:36,921
Glad you weren't hurt.

193
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:38,227
That's a puncture-proof tire.

194
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,562
Couldn't hurt that tire.

195
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,865
Knock the tree down first.

196
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:44,997
I still think Robert's
far too young to marry,

197
00:14:45,074 --> 00:14:48,373
and I was afraid some cheap
girl of vulgar family...

198
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,003
You understand.

199
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,640
Delicious, delicious!

200
00:14:55,384 --> 00:14:57,477
Robert tells me your husband
is a businessman.

201
00:14:57,553 --> 00:14:59,646
Yes, in a manner of speaking.

202
00:14:59,722 --> 00:15:03,021
However, his greatest
interest is in his inventions.

203
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:11,597
May I ask,
what does he invent?

204
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:13,532
Oh, various things.

205
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:18,563
For instance, he's been
working, lately, on a tire.

206
00:15:18,941 --> 00:15:21,501
A tire?
An automobile tire?

207
00:15:21,577 --> 00:15:23,204
That's been
invented already.

208
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:26,480
An automobile tire
that cannot be punctured.

209
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:28,847
Oh, but that's
impossible surely.

210
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:32,346
I've never heard
of any such tire.

211
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,651
And if there'd been a demand
for a puncture-proof tire,

212
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:37,954
surely someone would've
invented one before this.

213
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:41,519
They've been trying to
for 20 years, and here she is.

214
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:45,291
Mrs. Murchison,
this is my husband.

215
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:47,799
Your husband?

216
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,964
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
I want to show you this tire.

217
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,634
Look at the resiliency in that
thing. I think I'd better be going.

218
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,040
Samuel,

219
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,476
won't you please take
your invention out of here?

220
00:15:57,546 --> 00:15:59,036
All right.

221
00:16:02,952 --> 00:16:06,649
I take it Mr. Bisbee
did not come from Virginia.

222
00:16:06,722 --> 00:16:07,950
No.

223
00:16:08,023 --> 00:16:11,390
So Abigail's been telling you
her family history, eh?

224
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,087
Well,
you ain't seen a thing.

225
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:15,196
Wait till I show you
the Bisbee clan.

226
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:17,193
We were all Union men.

227
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:21,134
Sam, I don't think Mrs. Murchison
would be interested in those pictures.

228
00:16:21,203 --> 00:16:24,536
Oh, sure she would.
Real down-to-earth people.

229
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,469
Speak our language.

230
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:30,973
Now, there's Uncle Bean.
Bean Bisbee, the tiger.

231
00:16:31,046 --> 00:16:32,741
Fight at the drop of a hat,

232
00:16:32,815 --> 00:16:37,115
and yet underneath it all as
tenderhearted as a baby lamb.

233
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:38,847
Look at those eyes...

234
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:41,987
Wrong picture.
That was Uncle Jim.

235
00:16:42,057 --> 00:16:44,958
He was the black sheep of the
family, until he got into politics.

236
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:48,053
Now he's got a big home
up at Passamaquoddy.

237
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,155
And that's Aunt Minnie,

238
00:16:50,232 --> 00:16:53,133
an angel of mercy if ever
there was one, and there was.

239
00:16:53,202 --> 00:16:56,194
Known from California
to Maine and back again.

240
00:16:56,939 --> 00:16:59,032
Stay up all night
taking care of the boys,

241
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,575
night after night.

242
00:17:03,145 --> 00:17:04,976
I really must be going now.

243
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:08,539
Wait a minute. I want to show
you my private art collection.

244
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:10,107
Okay, Abigail?

245
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:16,413
Oh!

246
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:19,417
Not bad, eh?

247
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:20,792
Get the knee action?

248
00:17:21,363 --> 00:17:23,456
And stands without hitching!

249
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,360
Another relative, I presume.

250
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:26,366
No, no, no.

251
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:28,995
Just a little girl I met down
in the New Hebrides Islands.

252
00:17:32,741 --> 00:17:34,038
Hello.
Hello.

253
00:17:34,109 --> 00:17:35,508
What's the news
from the front?

254
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:37,545
All quiet, up to now.

255
00:17:37,613 --> 00:17:39,478
Shall we take a chance?
Now or never!

256
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:42,381
Your naive gaucherie is amazing. Huh?

257
00:17:42,451 --> 00:17:44,442
I said
your naive gaucherie.

258
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,609
Oh, yes.

259
00:17:45,721 --> 00:17:48,349
Thanks, thanks very much.
Nice of you to mention that.

260
00:17:48,424 --> 00:17:50,756
So this is the family
my son wants to marry into.

261
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:53,556
Yes, it is.
I really can't believe it.

262
00:17:53,629 --> 00:17:55,961
The whole affair will be
definitely broken up at once.

263
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,191
We shall
disinherit Robert

264
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:58,893
sooner than consent
to a marriage as...

265
00:17:58,967 --> 00:18:01,197
As impossible
as this one is!

266
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:04,035
Why, I'll crack her
in the eye.

267
00:18:04,106 --> 00:18:05,971
Come, Robert.
Just a moment, Mother.

268
00:18:07,209 --> 00:18:09,700
I don't know what's happened, but
I'm sure my mother doesn't mean...

269
00:18:09,778 --> 00:18:12,110
Your mother means everything
she has said and more!

270
00:18:12,181 --> 00:18:14,979
But, Mother, you can't talk
to Pauline's family like that.

271
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,312
What's happened?

272
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:18,580
Tell me. What is it? Your father.

273
00:18:18,654 --> 00:18:21,179
Everything was lovely,
then he came in.

274
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:23,019
Me? What'd I do?
Never mind, Dad.

275
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:24,582
They don't understand you.
That's all.

276
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,025
I meant
every word I said.

277
00:18:26,095 --> 00:18:27,562
I'm ashamed that
my son should...

278
00:18:27,629 --> 00:18:29,563
You've said quite enough.
Now, please go.

279
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:31,826
Bob, take your mother out
of here and don't come back.

280
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,629
Pauline,
I can explain everything.

281
00:18:33,702 --> 00:18:34,896
Say, who started all this?

282
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,665
Come, Robert.
Have you no pride left?

283
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:39,264
Don't you even know when
you've been ordered out?

284
00:18:39,808 --> 00:18:41,833
Pauline.
Goodbye.

285
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:45,447
You better go, son. You've
caused enough trouble around here.

286
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,011
Well, I guess I told him.

287
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:57,187
Yes, you certainly
fixed that up.

288
00:18:57,259 --> 00:18:59,318
You've got nothing
to worry about.

289
00:18:59,394 --> 00:19:02,921
I got a letter from the National
Tire Company right here in my pocket.

290
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:04,590
Well,
isn't that just dandy.

291
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,226
Now, I suppose I can marry
a balloon tire.

292
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:10,294
Well, I've been married
to one for 20 years,

293
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:12,363
and a flat one at that!

294
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:16,143
Now, you two,
listen to this letter.

295
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:17,676
"Mr. Samuel Bisbee...

296
00:19:18,847 --> 00:19:19,973
"Dear sir.

297
00:19:20,048 --> 00:19:24,280
"Your letter, at hand, regarding
the Bisbee Puncture-Proof Tire.

298
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:26,913
"If you care to
demonstrate your..."

299
00:20:03,926 --> 00:20:05,655
Mr. Samuel Bisbee.

300
00:20:14,136 --> 00:20:17,799
Mr. Bisbee? I'm Mr. Robbins,
the president of the company.

301
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:20,631
Pardon my glove. Glad
to know you, Mr. Robbins.

302
00:20:20,709 --> 00:20:22,506
Gentlemen, Mr. Bisbee.
How do you do?

303
00:20:22,578 --> 00:20:24,045
Gentlemen, glad to know you.

304
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,704
Are you ready to
show us your invention?

305
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:27,749
I'll be with you
in half a tick.

306
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:29,984
What's the idea
of the arsenal?

307
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,208
Going target shooting?

308
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,651
Use that for
demonstrating purposes.

309
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:33,983
Hey, what's this?

310
00:20:34,389 --> 00:20:36,482
That's another
of my inventions.

311
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:38,750
I call it
the "nose lifter-upper."

312
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:42,020
Makes breathing easy
and prevents snoring.

313
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:43,689
However, that's not for sale.

314
00:20:43,765 --> 00:20:44,754
And this?

315
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:48,764
This makes scrubbing floors
a pleasure.

316
00:20:48,971 --> 00:20:52,702
Put one on each foot, and
use the sponge as a polo ball.

317
00:20:52,774 --> 00:20:53,900
What's this?

318
00:20:54,643 --> 00:20:55,632
Twins.

319
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:58,707
That's not for sale
just at present.

320
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,873
I thought we came here
to see a puncture-proof tire.

321
00:21:00,949 --> 00:21:02,348
Yes. Did you bring a tire with you?

322
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:05,318
I have four tires
on my car, downstairs.

323
00:21:05,454 --> 00:21:06,614
If you'll follow me,

324
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:07,746
I'll give you
a demonstration

325
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:10,383
of a 1000%
puncture-proof tire,

326
00:21:10,525 --> 00:21:12,220
the Bisbee
Puncture-Proof Tire.

327
00:21:12,294 --> 00:21:13,386
All right, gentlemen,
let's go.

328
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:14,929
I don't like his looks.
He acts like a maniac.

329
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:16,464
He's harmless.
Yes?

330
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:17,964
Oh, pardon me.
Okay.

331
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:22,630
Help me push this heap down the line.

332
00:21:45,894 --> 00:21:47,794
Looks just like
an ordinary tire to me.

333
00:21:47,863 --> 00:21:49,228
Give him a chance.

334
00:21:49,298 --> 00:21:52,165
All right, thank you, gentlemen.
Will you please stand back?

335
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:55,833
These bullets bounce.

336
00:21:56,939 --> 00:22:01,171
I'm going to show you a real
1000% puncture-proof tire.

337
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:12,342
That's funny.

338
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:15,381
I'll try the other one.

339
00:22:22,764 --> 00:22:25,028
I told you he was just
another fool inventor.

340
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,499
I guess you're right.

341
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:29,134
You think so, eh?

342
00:22:29,204 --> 00:22:31,468
Well, I tell you, I haven't
crossed on those front tires,

343
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,337
but I put
the rear tires on myself.

344
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:34,534
I'm going to prove...

345
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:36,275
Watch this.

346
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,273
Now, this'll be
a different story.

347
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:50,024
They're a huge success!

348
00:22:50,425 --> 00:22:52,086
A perfect case of deflation!

349
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,994
<i>OFFICER ON RADIO.;
Calling all cars.</i>

350
00:23:00,268 --> 00:23:03,760
<i>Maniac shooting up cars on
Main Street. That is all.</i>

351
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:09,406
Hey, what are you doing there? Hey!

352
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,962
Where you going? Where
I usually go on Sundays.

353
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:33,991
Church?
Yes.

354
00:23:35,237 --> 00:23:37,797
I thought I might go
to church, myself, today.

355
00:23:37,873 --> 00:23:39,568
Mother's going with me.

356
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:43,043
You know why I'm here.

357
00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:45,906
I can't stay away from you.

358
00:23:46,748 --> 00:23:48,215
I called you
all day yesterday.

359
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:50,478
I know.
I wanted to answer.

360
00:23:51,586 --> 00:23:53,577
Oh, Bob, it's no use.

361
00:23:53,922 --> 00:23:55,856
I've thought it all out.

362
00:23:55,924 --> 00:23:59,291
I'll come by for you tonight, and
we'll drive to Stanton and get married.

363
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:02,353
I have more pride than
to marry into a family that...

364
00:24:02,431 --> 00:24:04,023
That thinks
they're too good for me.

365
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:05,828
Mother didn't mean that.

366
00:24:05,901 --> 00:24:07,732
She was just annoyed
with your dad.

367
00:24:07,803 --> 00:24:09,134
Well, Dad suits me.

368
00:24:09,604 --> 00:24:12,971
I think he has just as good
manners as your mother has.

369
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,338
Don't go.

370
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:15,902
Your dad's all right.

371
00:24:15,977 --> 00:24:17,171
You bet he is!

372
00:24:17,245 --> 00:24:19,543
And when he gets back from putting
that big deal over in the city,

373
00:24:19,614 --> 00:24:21,673
why, we'll have
as much money as you have.

374
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,774
You wait and see.

375
00:24:22,851 --> 00:24:24,819
Are you two children
quarreling?

376
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:27,787
Good morning, Mrs. Bisbee.
Good morning, Mr. Murchison.

377
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,153
Coming to church,
Pauline?

378
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:30,384
Yes, Mother.

379
00:24:31,827 --> 00:24:33,158
Pauline.

380
00:24:33,562 --> 00:24:34,688
Goodbye, Bob.

381
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,330
This is final.

382
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,707
There goes Sam Bisbee,
drunker than a hoot owl.

383
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:29,010
Is he a hard drinker?

384
00:25:29,284 --> 00:25:31,479
Hard? It's the easiest thing
he does.

385
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:39,785
Looks like I'm holding you
up. No, I got plenty of time.

386
00:25:39,861 --> 00:25:40,919
Pardon me.

387
00:25:40,996 --> 00:25:44,124
I should have brought
a little Vaseline with me.

388
00:25:48,303 --> 00:25:51,795
By golly, I put over
a big deal today!

389
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:55,305
Will my wife and kids
be tickled to death.

390
00:27:13,855 --> 00:27:16,346
Oh, I beg your pardon.
It was the wind.

391
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:41,839
"Goodwill tour."

392
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:44,616
If they only knew,
Rosita.

393
00:27:44,686 --> 00:27:46,654
But you must forget him,
Your Highness.

394
00:27:47,789 --> 00:27:49,381
Could you,
if you were I?

395
00:27:49,457 --> 00:27:50,981
Yes, officially.

396
00:27:51,326 --> 00:27:53,021
Confidentially, no.

397
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:58,364
So I am to forget Michael,
and marry the crown prince.

398
00:27:58,433 --> 00:27:59,957
But I can't forget Michael.

399
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:01,400
But you must.

400
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:04,201
You're right, Rosita.

401
00:28:04,773 --> 00:28:06,468
I must forget him.

402
00:28:08,677 --> 00:28:10,736
Why,
you've cut your finger.

403
00:28:10,812 --> 00:28:13,076
One moment, Your Highness.
The iodine.

404
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:14,775
It's nothing, Rosita.

405
00:28:14,849 --> 00:28:17,613
Nothing serious, but
we must take no chances.

406
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:19,415
I'll call Nicholas.

407
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:48,477
I bet he's got a woman in
there! I wouldn't be surprised.

408
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,647
There! What did I tell you?

409
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,261
I beg your pardon.
I beg yours!

410
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:05,063
I thought this was the
gentlemen's drawing account,

411
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,533
the washout.

412
00:29:07,602 --> 00:29:09,695
If you don't mind,
I think, perhaps...

413
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:13,336
I'm going right away.
I beg your pardon.

414
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,986
What's this?

415
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:29,152
What are you up to?

416
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:32,751
Don't do it, little lady.
It don't pay.

417
00:29:33,828 --> 00:29:35,455
When you wake up
in the morning

418
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,395
and find yourself dead,

419
00:29:37,465 --> 00:29:39,592
it's too late to regret it.

420
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:41,867
What are you talking about?

421
00:29:42,003 --> 00:29:43,971
Don't commit suicide.

422
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:46,734
You're too young.
You're too beautiful.

423
00:29:46,808 --> 00:29:48,799
I got here just in time.

424
00:29:49,177 --> 00:29:50,769
What makes you think that I...

425
00:29:50,845 --> 00:29:54,110
I was going to
do the same thing.

426
00:29:54,182 --> 00:29:55,274
You?

427
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,410
On this train,
not five minutes ago.

428
00:30:10,465 --> 00:30:12,399
Suppose I'd have
sent a telegram

429
00:30:12,934 --> 00:30:14,868
I'd have had to
go through with it.

430
00:30:16,971 --> 00:30:18,461
How terrible.

431
00:30:18,873 --> 00:30:19,999
Awful.

432
00:30:21,743 --> 00:30:23,506
Are you so unhappy?

433
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:30,844
Little lady, you think
you've got troubles?

434
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,947
Listen to mine.

435
00:30:37,258 --> 00:30:41,092
I lost my car,
I lost my tires,

436
00:30:41,162 --> 00:30:43,562
and I lost my patent
nose-lifter-upper.

437
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:45,155
Nose-lifter-upper?

438
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:48,327
Yeah, nose-lifter-upper.
The only one in existence.

439
00:30:48,403 --> 00:30:50,871
My own invention.
Poor man.

440
00:30:50,939 --> 00:30:54,966
When I get back to town,
everybody'll laugh at me,

441
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:58,538
except my wife.
She won't think it's funny.

442
00:30:59,848 --> 00:31:01,543
She'll murder me.

443
00:31:02,116 --> 00:31:04,380
But can't you explain to her
as you explained to me?

444
00:31:04,452 --> 00:31:07,819
No. You don't know my wife.

445
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:11,117
The other night
we had some folks to dinner.

446
00:31:11,192 --> 00:31:12,819
I said, "Abigail, dear,

447
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:15,426
"is it okay
if I take my vest off?"

448
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:19,789
She said, "You don't mind
keeping your pants on, do you?"

449
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:25,336
Uncalled-for sarcasm.

450
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:36,106
Yeah,
the great commoner, Bryan,

451
00:31:36,818 --> 00:31:39,013
almost went through
our town one time.

452
00:31:39,087 --> 00:31:40,611
Really?
Yes.

453
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:43,354
Crystal Springs.
Thank you.

454
00:31:51,766 --> 00:31:54,462
Has he come out yet?
No, he's still in there.

455
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,895
I feel sorry for
my little daughter.

456
00:31:57,972 --> 00:32:00,372
I depended upon this trip
to put her over.

457
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:01,669
Have you a daughter?

458
00:32:01,743 --> 00:32:03,574
Yes, she's a sweet kid,

459
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:06,078
but she's in love
with a rich clown.

460
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:07,375
Clown?

461
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:09,774
Son of the Murchison family,

462
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:13,043
the richest people
in Crystal Springs.

463
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:15,322
Oh, I see. Society.

464
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,722
Yeah. Mrs. Murchison!

465
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,624
Looks like
an old Newfoundland dog.

466
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:23,186
Don't you care for society?

467
00:32:23,264 --> 00:32:24,822
We don't go in for it.

468
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:26,696
We live on the other side
of the railroad tracks.

469
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:28,133
But you wouldn't
understand that.

470
00:32:28,202 --> 00:32:29,692
I think I understand.

471
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:31,238
It's the same in my country,

472
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:33,137
only we call it
"class distinction."

473
00:32:33,207 --> 00:32:35,573
Yeah, we still call it
railroad tracks.

474
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:39,807
Here's my little daughter.

475
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:42,408
It's my wife
on the other side.

476
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:44,007
She's lovely...
Isn't she a honey?

477
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,712
She's lovely.

478
00:32:45,787 --> 00:32:47,755
It's sad to be
young and in love

479
00:32:47,922 --> 00:32:49,583
and not to marry
the loved one.

480
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:52,219
Don't you think so, Mr...

481
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:55,353
Bisbee's the name, but my
friends all call me Sam.

482
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:56,954
All right, Sam.

483
00:32:57,031 --> 00:32:59,431
But your daughter should
marry the man she loves.

484
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,094
There must be a way,
in this country.

485
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,367
Only a fairy princess
could put it over now,

486
00:33:05,907 --> 00:33:07,636
and there ain't
no such thing.

487
00:33:07,709 --> 00:33:09,643
Don't be too sure, Sam.

488
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:13,112
You never can tell when a fairy
princess might come to your rescue.

489
00:33:13,181 --> 00:33:15,513
Thanks, thanks, Miss...
What's your name?

490
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,050
My friends call me Marie.

491
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,517
Thanks, Marie.

492
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:20,520
If you ever get down
to Crystal Springs,

493
00:33:20,588 --> 00:33:22,556
you must stop in
to see us.

494
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:25,559
My wife and daughter would be
tickled to death to see you.

495
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,356
Well, I hope
I haven't bored you.

496
00:33:27,428 --> 00:33:29,419
Bored me?
You've saved my life.

497
00:33:29,497 --> 00:33:32,989
Well, thank you. Goodbye.

498
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:35,592
Crystal Springs.
Don't forget it.

499
00:33:39,607 --> 00:33:41,199
What time do we get
to Crystal Springs?

500
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:44,301
Crystal Springs?
We just passed it.

501
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:45,641
Why didn't you call it out?

502
00:33:45,713 --> 00:33:48,273
I did, sir, but you was too
busy with that lady back there.

503
00:33:48,349 --> 00:33:50,078
Oh, drat!

504
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:58,223
When do we get to the next
stop? Albian, 40 miles.

505
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:01,592
Drat!

506
00:34:02,497 --> 00:34:03,987
Drat!

507
00:34:07,735 --> 00:34:08,997
Drat!

508
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:17,372
You sent for me,
Your Highness?

509
00:34:17,445 --> 00:34:19,072
What engagements have we,
Nicholas?

510
00:34:19,147 --> 00:34:22,947
Tonight, the usual reception
by the city officials.

511
00:34:23,017 --> 00:34:24,041
Tomorrow?

512
00:34:24,118 --> 00:34:26,450
Tomorrow,
Your Highness rests.

513
00:34:27,455 --> 00:34:32,483
Excellent. That fits in perfectly
with an idea I have in mind.

514
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,994
I saw Sam Bisbee
on the train coming home.

515
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:42,628
He was drunk and making love to one
of them painted dolls in a compartment.

516
00:34:42,704 --> 00:34:43,932
Did you say
anything to him?

517
00:34:44,005 --> 00:34:47,133
I was just going to tell him, "Sam
Bisbee, what would your wife say?"

518
00:34:47,208 --> 00:34:48,869
And what do you
suppose he did?

519
00:34:48,943 --> 00:34:53,243
He leered at me, gave me an evil
wink, and slammed the door in my face.

520
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:55,839
And they went right on through
town. He didn't even get off.

521
00:34:55,917 --> 00:34:58,886
What do you suppose
they did in there, then?

522
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:01,285
I don't pretend to know,
Sarah.

523
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:03,289
It's entirely
out of my line.

524
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:07,925
Sells his invention
in the city for $100,000,

525
00:35:07,995 --> 00:35:10,190
and then what does he do
with all that money?

526
00:35:10,264 --> 00:35:13,199
Runs off with
a notorious Russian dancer.

527
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:17,203
No!
Yes. One of them Romanoffs.

528
00:35:17,271 --> 00:35:19,296
What's all the excitement about? Sam.

529
00:35:19,373 --> 00:35:20,601
Anything happen to him?

530
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:22,540
Who'd have thought it.
Poor old Sam!

531
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:24,043
He ain't in trouble,
is he?

532
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:25,477
Oh, boy, and how.

533
00:35:25,546 --> 00:35:26,979
Here's the way
I got the story.

534
00:35:27,048 --> 00:35:31,041
Sam goes on a tear up in the city and
picks up a woman, some foreign actress,

535
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,986
and he's going across the
country with her in a stateroom.

536
00:35:34,055 --> 00:35:37,821
They went through here, throwing
champagne bottles out of the window.

537
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,408
I tell you the best of
them are nothing but beasts.

538
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:56,067
No, you can't trust
one of them.

539
00:35:56,144 --> 00:35:57,941
And isn't that
just like Sam Bisbee?

540
00:35:58,012 --> 00:36:00,276
Traipsing around the country
with a burlesque queen.

541
00:36:00,348 --> 00:36:01,508
She was sitting
on his lap,

542
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:03,607
and he was drinking
champagne out of her slipper.

543
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:05,675
When he sees
Mrs. Price is watching him,

544
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:08,085
he gets up and slams
the door and locks it.

545
00:36:08,156 --> 00:36:09,487
You know
who she was?

546
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:11,684
I think it was
one of them fan dancers.

547
00:36:16,597 --> 00:36:17,996
How do, Mrs. Price?

548
00:36:18,065 --> 00:36:20,659
How dare you speak
to a respectable woman!

549
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:25,462
What's wrong with her?

550
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:28,338
Hello. Lovely weather
we're having.

551
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:37,211
Hello, Jane, how are
you? Fine, Mr. Bisbee.

552
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:40,379
How are you?
I'm fine, thanks.

553
00:36:40,454 --> 00:36:41,944
How's your...

554
00:36:50,298 --> 00:36:51,560
Maybe that was it.

555
00:36:53,301 --> 00:36:55,792
Fellows, here's the sheik!
Hello, boys.

556
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,100
How was she, Sam?

557
00:36:58,172 --> 00:36:59,639
Has she got a friend?

558
00:37:01,909 --> 00:37:05,310
What's the matter with you
guys? You all gone nuts?

559
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:10,950
I can't understand what's
happened to this town.

560
00:37:11,018 --> 00:37:13,543
Everybody shuns me
like I had leprosy.

561
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:15,680
We've been
hearing things, Sam.

562
00:37:15,756 --> 00:37:17,587
It was a tough break,
that's all.

563
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:20,684
How did I know I was
shooting up a police car?

564
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:23,286
Sam, Charlie and me
are your friends.

565
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:26,162
We're with you
no matter what, see?

566
00:37:26,234 --> 00:37:28,702
If ever I needed
friends in all my life,

567
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:30,503
I need them today.

568
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:32,169
Who was she, Sam?

569
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:33,566
Who was who?

570
00:37:33,641 --> 00:37:36,007
That woman you had
on the train.

571
00:37:43,084 --> 00:37:45,109
Oh, so that's it, is it?

572
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:50,555
Ain't it funny how much trouble
a man can get into innocently?

573
00:37:54,161 --> 00:37:57,028
Come on, Sam,
tell us who she was.

574
00:37:57,098 --> 00:38:00,659
She was the finest lady
I ever met in my life.

575
00:38:20,121 --> 00:38:22,817
Joke's on me, Sam.
Wrong jug.

576
00:38:24,792 --> 00:38:27,920
Try some of this
new blended stuff.

577
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,860
It's a funny old world.

578
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:38,238
A man's lucky
if he gets out of it alive.

579
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:38,128
I never met a princess before.

580
00:39:38,199 --> 00:39:40,394
I never met anything
higher than an elk!

581
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:55,477
Princess Lescaboura.

582
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:57,646
I'm the Mayor
of Crystal Springs.

583
00:39:57,718 --> 00:39:58,776
I'm delighted.

584
00:39:58,853 --> 00:40:00,582
Will you step
this way, please?

585
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:04,722
I'll be all right.
Take care of Rosita.

586
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:11,488
May I present the Chairman of
our Entertainment Committee,

587
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:14,056
Mrs. Edward Quimby Murchison.

588
00:40:14,135 --> 00:40:17,036
Oh, yes! I've heard
of Mrs. Murchison.

589
00:40:17,104 --> 00:40:19,538
Really? I'm charmed.

590
00:40:19,607 --> 00:40:22,337
My husband, Mr. Murchison.
Delighted.

591
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,674
Maybe you'd like to take
a little drive around the city

592
00:40:24,745 --> 00:40:26,542
or something,
eh, Your Majesty?

593
00:40:26,614 --> 00:40:28,479
Thank you. But I must
first see the friends

594
00:40:28,549 --> 00:40:30,210
I've come to visit
in your charming city.

595
00:40:30,284 --> 00:40:32,479
We shall include them,
of course.

596
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:34,684
You're too kind.

597
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:36,652
Are you sure
you won't mind?

598
00:40:36,724 --> 00:40:38,954
Princess! How could we?
Thank you.

599
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,796
Well, well,
I don't see him.

600
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:45,388
Him? Who?

601
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:48,060
Everyone Your Highness might be
interested in meeting is here.

602
00:40:48,135 --> 00:40:49,727
I've seen to that.

603
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:52,705
But I don't see my
old friend, Mr. Bisbee.

604
00:40:53,874 --> 00:40:56,172
Did she say Bisbee?
Bisbee?

605
00:40:57,445 --> 00:41:01,381
There is a Bisbee in our town, but
he's not one of our best citizens.

606
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:05,408
Then it couldn't be the same
Bisbee. I mean Samuel Bisbee.

607
00:41:05,786 --> 00:41:07,276
Surely you don't mean...

608
00:41:07,354 --> 00:41:09,379
Not Sam Bisbee,
Your Highness?

609
00:41:10,591 --> 00:41:12,183
Yes, Sam Bisbee.

610
00:41:12,259 --> 00:41:15,422
A real hero
and one of nature's noblemen!

611
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:17,794
A hero?
Sam Bisbee?

612
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:20,629
No one will ever know what
he did for me during the war.

613
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:23,693
What did he do for you,
if I'm not too inquisitive?

614
00:41:24,705 --> 00:41:26,400
He saved my life.

615
00:41:26,841 --> 00:41:30,208
Why... Your Royal Princess...
I mean, Your High Majesty,

616
00:41:30,277 --> 00:41:32,905
if we'd have knowed it was
Sam Bisbee you was looking for,

617
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,676
we'd have had him
down here, but, gosh...

618
00:41:35,749 --> 00:41:37,410
Would it be
asking too much?

619
00:41:37,485 --> 00:41:39,009
Would you drive me
to his home?

620
00:41:39,086 --> 00:41:41,680
His home? You mean you
want to go to his house?

621
00:41:41,755 --> 00:41:43,313
Yes.

622
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,483
Why, it's a pleasure,
Your Majesty.

623
00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:46,548
Thank you.

624
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:48,926
Where does Bisbee live?

625
00:41:48,996 --> 00:41:50,964
The other side
of the railroad tracks.

626
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,999
Gosh all hemlock!

627
00:41:56,403 --> 00:41:58,462
We're sure it's the wrong
Bisbee, Your Highness,

628
00:41:58,539 --> 00:42:00,029
but if you insist.

629
00:42:00,107 --> 00:42:01,734
All ready, boys?

630
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:08,114
What'd you tell her? Well,
what could I tell her, Sam?

631
00:42:08,182 --> 00:42:09,911
When your wife phoned
and asked me were you here,

632
00:42:09,984 --> 00:42:11,679
I said you were
on the way home.

633
00:42:11,752 --> 00:42:14,243
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

634
00:42:16,957 --> 00:42:20,256
If I had enough money to pay
your back salary, I'd fire you!

635
00:42:22,496 --> 00:42:23,895
Think I'll do it anyhow.

636
00:42:23,964 --> 00:42:25,989
Why don't you take
your wife home a present?

637
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,829
A little pet of some kind.

638
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:31,394
Women are crazy about pets.
They're just crazy.

639
00:42:31,472 --> 00:42:34,100
Pets haven't a thing to do
with it. Look at Charlie there.

640
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,075
See what I'm taking
home for the old lady?

641
00:42:36,143 --> 00:42:39,977
It'll take a bigger bird than
that to square me with my wife.

642
00:42:42,216 --> 00:42:43,547
Hey, pet man!

643
00:42:48,422 --> 00:42:49,446
Whoa, Myrtle!

644
00:42:49,523 --> 00:42:52,651
Hey! Myrtle! Look at Sam
with that funny-looking bird.

645
00:42:52,726 --> 00:42:55,661
Myrtle, look out! The
lamp post! The lamp post!

646
00:42:55,729 --> 00:42:57,287
Get down, Myrt!
Come on, now.

647
00:42:57,364 --> 00:42:59,127
Come on. Now you're okay.

648
00:43:00,901 --> 00:43:03,563
Now, come here!
Come here! Come here!

649
00:43:04,271 --> 00:43:07,434
Come back here!
Come here! Come here!

650
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,728
Put your hat
over your head!

651
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:35,127
It's a shame, Your Highness,

652
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:38,194
you came all this way
only to find the wrong Bisbee.

653
00:43:42,509 --> 00:43:44,943
Edward! Edward!
Isn't that Bisbee?

654
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,407
Yes, my dear,
that's Bisbee.

655
00:43:48,482 --> 00:43:50,006
Well, stop him!
Stop him quickly!

656
00:43:50,084 --> 00:43:52,552
Hi, boys!
Catch Bisbee there.

657
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,815
We want Bisbee.
Catch him. Stop him!

658
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,615
Come on, Myrt! Here.

659
00:44:24,685 --> 00:44:26,277
Mr. Bisbee!
Sam!

660
00:44:26,353 --> 00:44:28,446
Bisbee!
Sam!

661
00:44:30,391 --> 00:44:32,723
Come on up
out of there.

662
00:44:34,028 --> 00:44:36,963
Bisbee! Bisbee!
Old Sam, come here!

663
00:44:38,332 --> 00:44:41,460
Your old friend,
the Princess Lescaboura.

664
00:44:41,535 --> 00:44:43,366
Who?
Hello, Sam.

665
00:44:50,711 --> 00:44:54,306
I'm afraid you girls
have the advantage of me.

666
00:44:54,581 --> 00:44:58,881
Surely you remember the girl whose
life you saved during the war?

667
00:45:05,459 --> 00:45:07,620
Marie! How are you?

668
00:45:07,695 --> 00:45:10,357
You're a sight for sore eyes!
Fancy meeting you here!

669
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:12,592
We're conducting Her Royal
Highness to your home.

670
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:15,191
Her Royal Highness?
The Princess Lescaboura.

671
00:45:15,703 --> 00:45:17,637
You are, eh? Well...

672
00:45:17,705 --> 00:45:19,229
We're on our way to your
house. Come along, Sam.

673
00:45:19,306 --> 00:45:20,933
Yes, do come, do come.

674
00:45:21,008 --> 00:45:23,101
Say, I wouldn't ride in the
same carriage with that dame

675
00:45:23,177 --> 00:45:25,042
for all the money
in the world.

676
00:45:27,414 --> 00:45:29,439
If you don't mind, I'll
give my place to Mr. Bisbee

677
00:45:29,516 --> 00:45:30,608
and ride with the mayor.

678
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,709
Thank you so much.
Come along, Sam.

679
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:35,084
They rolls off my knife.

680
00:45:35,155 --> 00:45:37,055
Here, Murchie,
hold the chickadee.

681
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:40,218
If she starts singing,
give her some birdseed.

682
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:45,421
Well, Marie,
here we are again.

683
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:49,936
I'm surprised you didn't recognize your
old friend, the Princess Lescaboura.

684
00:45:50,003 --> 00:45:51,402
Lescaboura!

685
00:45:52,706 --> 00:45:55,368
That's a funny name. How'd
you happen to think that up?

686
00:45:56,643 --> 00:45:59,134
That princess stuff's
a great idea.

687
00:46:00,047 --> 00:46:02,311
Hope we can put it
over on the wife.

688
00:46:02,383 --> 00:46:05,443
Must be a fire!
Maybe it's the ambulance!

689
00:46:07,688 --> 00:46:10,782
There she is now. Duck!

690
00:46:28,609 --> 00:46:31,442
How do you do, Mrs. Bisbee?
I'm so glad to see you.

691
00:46:31,512 --> 00:46:34,037
Isn't this an honor for our town? Honor?

692
00:46:34,114 --> 00:46:37,106
Why,
the Princess Lescaboura!

693
00:46:41,288 --> 00:46:43,848
Your Highness, have I your
permission to present Mrs. Bisbee

694
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:45,323
and her daughter, Pauline?

695
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:47,860
I'm so happy to know you,
Mrs. Bisbee.

696
00:46:49,096 --> 00:46:51,997
I think you're the luckiest
woman in the world.

697
00:46:52,065 --> 00:46:53,623
Is my husband dead?

698
00:46:53,734 --> 00:46:55,201
Not at all.

699
00:46:55,502 --> 00:46:59,268
And you, the daughter of my dear
friend and benefactor Colonel Bisbee.

700
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:02,103
Aw, gee!
Thanks, Princess.

701
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:04,575
You don't realize
what a great thrill this is.

702
00:47:04,645 --> 00:47:06,977
Of course, I don't know
what my dad did, but...

703
00:47:07,047 --> 00:47:10,710
You don't know he saved the
Princess's life during the war?

704
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:14,417
Heroes don't talk much,
do they, my dear?

705
00:47:14,488 --> 00:47:18,618
But in my country, the name
Samuel Bisbee is a household word.

706
00:47:21,695 --> 00:47:22,719
Mother!

707
00:47:23,096 --> 00:47:24,256
Mother!

708
00:47:24,865 --> 00:47:29,131
Quickly, get some water! Quick!
Won't somebody get some water?

709
00:47:29,203 --> 00:47:31,228
Look out, she may be stalling.

710
00:47:33,974 --> 00:47:37,137
There, there, Mother!
How are you feeling now?

711
00:47:38,078 --> 00:47:39,670
I'm all right.

712
00:47:41,648 --> 00:47:43,639
I'll get your husband.

713
00:47:44,918 --> 00:47:47,978
Colonel! Colonel Bisbee!

714
00:47:49,056 --> 00:47:50,387
Sam!

715
00:48:02,035 --> 00:48:05,198
Hello, Abigail, dear.
Did you miss me?

716
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:07,701
Hello, Samuel.

717
00:48:08,509 --> 00:48:09,533
Your Highness,

718
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:11,100
I know
it's an awful lot to ask,

719
00:48:11,178 --> 00:48:12,805
but won't you come in?

720
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,142
I'd be delighted!

721
00:48:15,582 --> 00:48:16,947
Won't you all come in?

722
00:48:17,017 --> 00:48:18,575
Charmed, I assure you.

723
00:48:23,023 --> 00:48:25,355
It looks like a great day
for the Bisbee family.

724
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:28,087
Thank you, Mayor. You haven't a
little dram on the hip, have you?

725
00:48:28,161 --> 00:48:31,153
Colonel, I always have
something on the hip.

726
00:48:47,481 --> 00:48:49,676
Mayor, you're okay.

727
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:51,741
I voted for you
last election.

728
00:48:52,085 --> 00:48:53,211
Five times.

729
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,124
Your Highness, please.

730
00:49:08,201 --> 00:49:10,726
Before you make
any other engagements,

731
00:49:10,804 --> 00:49:12,533
I've invited some
of our best people

732
00:49:12,606 --> 00:49:14,039
to my home
to dinner tonight.

733
00:49:14,107 --> 00:49:16,098
I hope you'll enjoy
meeting them.

734
00:49:16,243 --> 00:49:17,710
I'm so sorry,

735
00:49:17,778 --> 00:49:21,839
but you see, I'm dining with
the Bisbee family this evening.

736
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:25,342
But Your Highness!

737
00:49:25,419 --> 00:49:28,479
I've made all the preparations,
engaged the caterers.

738
00:49:28,555 --> 00:49:31,251
Why how fortunate!
You won't object, will you?

739
00:49:31,325 --> 00:49:32,553
Object?

740
00:49:32,626 --> 00:49:35,424
If Mrs. Murchison's caterers
served the dinner in your home?

741
00:49:35,495 --> 00:49:37,929
Then you could invite
all your friends.

742
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:42,662
Well, of course I'd be delighted,
if it pleases Your Highness.

743
00:49:42,736 --> 00:49:44,966
It pleases me very much.

744
00:49:45,038 --> 00:49:46,869
And you're all invited.

745
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,965
Isn't she marvelous!
What an idea!

746
00:49:49,042 --> 00:49:51,408
I never would have
thought of it myself.

747
00:49:56,149 --> 00:49:58,777
I can't tell you how I
appreciate it, Mrs. Bisbee.

748
00:49:58,852 --> 00:50:00,877
What was that?
I beg your pardon.

749
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:03,514
Allowing me to use
your lovely home for my party.

750
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,525
Not at all. It's a pleasure.
Excuse me.

751
00:50:08,528 --> 00:50:11,361
How do you do, Mrs. Bisbee?
Good evening, Robert.

752
00:50:12,265 --> 00:50:14,392
Thank you, thank you,
gentlemen. Thank you.

753
00:50:14,468 --> 00:50:16,095
Well, Samuel?

754
00:50:16,436 --> 00:50:19,530
Abigail, my dear,
the party's a big success.

755
00:50:19,606 --> 00:50:22,268
Don't be so stiff.
Relax! Relax!

756
00:50:22,342 --> 00:50:23,934
How can you
in this armor?

757
00:50:28,281 --> 00:50:29,646
Sam, you look marvelous.

758
00:50:29,716 --> 00:50:33,675
Oh, thanks, thanks, thanks.
Marie, you're a prince.

759
00:50:33,754 --> 00:50:37,485
Princess... Princess!
Oh, yeah, Princess.

760
00:50:38,091 --> 00:50:40,719
Your Highness,
won't you come in?

761
00:50:46,633 --> 00:50:49,193
Your Highness, may I
present Mr. Robert Murchison?

762
00:50:49,269 --> 00:50:51,794
How do you do?
Not Bob Murchison?

763
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:52,861
Really!

764
00:50:52,939 --> 00:50:54,839
You're Pauline's fiancژe,
are you not?

765
00:50:54,908 --> 00:50:56,273
Not yet, Your Highness,

766
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:58,243
but I still have hopes.
Well...

767
00:50:58,311 --> 00:51:00,677
And this is Mr. Phil
Cummings. How do you do?

768
00:51:00,747 --> 00:51:05,184
She's a darling! She's the
finest lady I ever met in my life.

769
00:51:05,252 --> 00:51:07,186
Except you
and your mother.

770
00:51:07,254 --> 00:51:08,846
Thanks, Dad.

771
00:51:08,922 --> 00:51:10,651
Don't drink
too much tonight.

772
00:51:10,824 --> 00:51:12,086
No, I won't.

773
00:51:14,027 --> 00:51:15,722
That's an idea.

774
00:51:40,654 --> 00:51:42,622
Won't you sit down,
Your Highness? Certainly.

775
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:44,816
Come and sit with me.
Thank you.

776
00:51:49,529 --> 00:51:52,293
What a marvelous match
they will make.

777
00:51:52,599 --> 00:51:54,590
Take off those spats!
Huh?

778
00:51:54,668 --> 00:51:55,930
And come right in here!

779
00:51:56,002 --> 00:51:59,062
Oh, yeah, I'll have them right
off in a minute. I'll be right in.

780
00:52:02,075 --> 00:52:04,066
Hey, you boys stick around.

781
00:52:04,144 --> 00:52:06,476
There's going to be
turkey and ice cream later.

782
00:52:06,546 --> 00:52:09,276
Samuel!
Yes, dear? Yes, dear?

783
00:52:11,218 --> 00:52:12,583
Yes, dear?

784
00:52:14,888 --> 00:52:17,550
Take that junk with you.
Yes, dear? Coming, dear.

785
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:19,683
Your Highness, friends,

786
00:52:20,127 --> 00:52:22,186
I have a little
surprise for you.

787
00:52:22,262 --> 00:52:26,096
It gives me great pleasure to announce
the engagement of my son, Robert,

788
00:52:26,166 --> 00:52:28,066
to Miss Pauline Bisbee.

789
00:52:29,402 --> 00:52:32,235
Formal announcements
will follow by mail.

790
00:52:34,841 --> 00:52:37,867
Congratulations!
Congratulations!

791
00:52:43,517 --> 00:52:46,850
...be here, and everything.
I'm enjoying it.

792
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:49,181
Murchie,
you're a good scout.

793
00:52:49,256 --> 00:52:50,746
I'm beginning to like you. Oh?

794
00:52:50,824 --> 00:52:52,689
If you want a little
snort of gin later on,

795
00:52:52,759 --> 00:52:54,351
I know where there's
some stashed away,

796
00:52:54,427 --> 00:52:55,689
out here in the closet...

797
00:52:55,762 --> 00:52:59,630
You play golf, of course, Your
Graceness? I mean, Your High Royalness.

798
00:52:59,699 --> 00:53:02,725
Yes, but very badly, I'm
afraid. How fortunate!

799
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:04,828
We're opening our new
country club tomorrow.

800
00:53:04,905 --> 00:53:07,169
I'm going to ball off
the first tee.

801
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,764
If you really
want to please me,

802
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:10,241
let me come and watch my dear friend,

803
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:11,709
Sam Bisbee,
open the new course.

804
00:53:11,778 --> 00:53:13,643
Sam Bisbee? Sam?

805
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:15,815
It would
make me very happy.

806
00:53:15,882 --> 00:53:17,850
Anything
Your Highness desires.

807
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:20,478
I'm afraid I can't do it.
I just hurt my foot.

808
00:53:20,554 --> 00:53:23,079
Will you make an announcement,
please? Certainly.

809
00:53:23,156 --> 00:53:24,521
Ladies and gentlemen!

810
00:53:24,591 --> 00:53:26,218
I wish to
announce the opening

811
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:27,282
of our new course

812
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,453
tomorrow afternoon sharp.

813
00:53:29,529 --> 00:53:34,023
Our esteemed friend, Mr. Sam
Bisbee will kick off the first tee.

814
00:53:34,334 --> 00:53:37,360
I mean, will knock off the first green.

815
00:53:37,437 --> 00:53:40,895
Shall we all go in to
dinner, Your Honor? Delighted.

816
00:53:41,575 --> 00:53:44,601
His Honor has
a beautiful bun on.

817
00:53:44,678 --> 00:53:47,545
You know, I have
a set of golf clubs.

818
00:53:48,081 --> 00:53:49,810
They were left to me
by my grandfather.

819
00:53:49,883 --> 00:53:51,282
He was an inventor, too,
you know.

820
00:53:51,351 --> 00:53:54,320
That's fine, Sam.
You'll do all right.

821
00:53:54,421 --> 00:53:57,822
Marie, this princess stuff is
working like a million dollars.

822
00:53:57,891 --> 00:53:59,654
Keep it up! Keep it up!

823
00:54:01,995 --> 00:54:03,360
Fish eggs!

824
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:09,159
All right, folks.
Step this way.

825
00:54:09,236 --> 00:54:11,466
We're about to start
the festivities.

826
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:14,273
I'm depending a lot upon you.

827
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:17,139
I was never on a golf course
in my life before.

828
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:19,838
Don't worry.
Neither was I.

829
00:54:22,082 --> 00:54:23,640
I don't like
that boy's face.

830
00:54:23,717 --> 00:54:25,480
Why, he's the best caddy
they have in the club.

831
00:54:25,552 --> 00:54:27,179
He don't know
from nothing.

832
00:54:27,254 --> 00:54:28,346
Well, pretend you know.

833
00:54:28,421 --> 00:54:30,184
Talk as though
you know all about it.

834
00:54:30,257 --> 00:54:32,350
Well, I'll do
the best I can.

835
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:35,120
This is a happy day,
Mrs. Bisbee.

836
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:36,719
Do you know,
I'm really quite worried.

837
00:54:36,796 --> 00:54:38,957
I don't believe he ever hit
a golf ball in his life.

838
00:54:39,032 --> 00:54:41,262
Don't worry, Mother.
He'll try anything once.

839
00:54:41,334 --> 00:54:43,962
Hey! Get out...
Hey!

840
00:54:52,012 --> 00:54:53,775
Mr. Bisbee!

841
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:57,239
Ladies and gentlemen, as
Chairman of the Greens Committee,

842
00:54:57,317 --> 00:54:59,285
it gives me
great pleasure to announce

843
00:54:59,352 --> 00:55:03,152
that Mr. Sam Bisbee will knock
the first ball off the course.

844
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:10,158
I thank you
for your confidence.

845
00:55:20,707 --> 00:55:22,538
Going to be a great help,
that boy.

846
00:55:22,609 --> 00:55:25,476
I haven't played since playing in
the Thousand Islands, years ago.

847
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:28,378
What are you doing? Stop
that! Stop it! Stand still.

848
00:55:28,448 --> 00:55:31,679
Put it... Put the bag down.
Go! What are you doing?

849
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:36,586
I haven't played since playing in
the Thousand Islands, many years ago.

850
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:38,647
I used to be in the dressing
business up there.

851
00:55:38,725 --> 00:55:40,386
In the early days
in the Thousand Islands,

852
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,759
we used to tee off on one
island and drive to the other.

853
00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:45,559
How far is it from
one island to the other?

854
00:55:45,632 --> 00:55:46,894
About a mile.

855
00:55:46,967 --> 00:55:49,492
Really?
You could drive a mile?

856
00:55:49,569 --> 00:55:51,628
We used to putt
a quarter of a mile.

857
00:55:52,973 --> 00:55:55,874
Of course, we had to
have the wind behind us.

858
00:55:56,843 --> 00:56:00,176
Little too much whip
in that club, nimrod.

859
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:03,378
Now stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

860
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,975
By the way, did you
bring a ball with you?

861
00:56:06,353 --> 00:56:08,048
Wonderful!

862
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:09,880
Now, stand...

863
00:56:10,623 --> 00:56:12,887
You don't play golf
with these things.

864
00:56:13,727 --> 00:56:18,164
There's a marvelous club.
Bought that club in Europe.

865
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:20,322
Where's that club
I bought in India?

866
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,628
Let me see
that Indian club...

867
00:56:21,701 --> 00:56:22,690
Never mind.
Wait a minute.

868
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:24,430
I bought a wonderful club
in Toronto.

869
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:27,473
Did you? Yeah, give
me that Canadian club.

870
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,566
This is a very remarkable
piece of wood...

871
00:56:30,643 --> 00:56:34,340
I told you to hide that
and not let anyone see it...

872
00:56:37,584 --> 00:56:39,609
You know
I never use tobacco.

873
00:56:40,854 --> 00:56:42,253
That's no good.

874
00:56:43,623 --> 00:56:47,081
Now, stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

875
00:56:50,397 --> 00:56:52,957
Ah, just as I thought.
It's warped.

876
00:56:53,533 --> 00:56:55,330
Try this putting niblick.

877
00:56:55,535 --> 00:56:56,524
Putting niblick?

878
00:56:56,903 --> 00:56:58,734
A putting niblick!

879
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:02,702
Oh, that's much better.
Ah, that's much better.

880
00:57:02,776 --> 00:57:05,870
Now, stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

881
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,118
Stand clear!

882
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:53,088
Stop it!

883
00:57:53,326 --> 00:57:55,954
Now, you stand clear and
keep your eye on this ball.

884
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,889
Sorry to have
lost my temper.

885
00:58:00,567 --> 00:58:02,091
Stand clear!

886
00:58:30,730 --> 00:58:32,493
Quite a breeze!

887
00:59:01,928 --> 00:59:03,793
You stand still, will you?

888
00:59:04,097 --> 00:59:05,621
Maybe this'll help a bit.

889
00:59:06,866 --> 00:59:09,699
Stand still and keep
your eye on this ball.

890
00:59:10,637 --> 00:59:13,197
I never should have had
a caddy in the first place.

891
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:16,898
Go on and hit it, Sam.
They're all watching you.

892
00:59:16,976 --> 00:59:18,876
Well, I know,
but this chap keeps...

893
00:59:21,714 --> 00:59:24,581
Stay still if I have
to choke you to death!

894
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:29,547
Awfully sorry I keep
losing my temper...

895
00:59:31,925 --> 00:59:33,483
Godfrey Daniel!

896
00:59:41,067 --> 00:59:44,002
It's chocolate custard.
I'm dripping.

897
00:59:50,343 --> 00:59:53,471
I was a fool to ever
bring a caddy with me.

898
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:58,346
Go away! Go away!

899
01:00:09,128 --> 01:00:11,323
Look at that thing!

900
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,227
Got the pie on there, yeah.

901
01:00:17,937 --> 01:00:19,905
Put your foot on that.

902
01:00:23,543 --> 01:00:26,706
Now stand clear and keep
your eye on the ball.

903
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,810
Look at that thing.
It's still going that way.

904
01:00:29,882 --> 01:00:32,442
I was a fool for
ever having a caddy.

905
01:00:39,092 --> 01:00:41,322
Hope they can't see this.

906
01:00:41,494 --> 01:00:43,325
Come on, go away.

907
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:04,248
You know, when you first
suggested the caddy I...

908
01:01:04,317 --> 01:01:05,909
I was against it
right from the start.

909
01:01:05,985 --> 01:01:08,249
I wanted to carry
the clubs myself.

910
01:01:10,690 --> 01:01:12,248
But of course when you...

911
01:01:12,525 --> 01:01:14,186
Don't get
too annoyed, Sam.

912
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:16,353
I'm not annoyed,
only...

913
01:01:16,596 --> 01:01:19,895
I look like... I look
like a fool out here.

914
01:01:19,966 --> 01:01:22,127
All these people,
they're...

915
01:01:26,406 --> 01:01:29,375
You stand clear and keep
your eye on this ball.

916
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:31,467
I think I'll hit it now.

917
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:38,410
You see? Sorry...

918
01:01:40,586 --> 01:01:43,612
There it goes again.
Come on.

919
01:01:50,029 --> 01:01:51,963
There's your pie!

920
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:57,929
You stand clear and keep
your eye on this ball!

921
01:02:05,845 --> 01:02:07,278
Take that!

922
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:13,581
I hope you lose your nail.

923
01:02:14,087 --> 01:02:17,921
I really don't. I'm only fooling,
pretending I do, you know.

924
01:02:23,696 --> 01:02:28,099
That's strange. It was
around here just a minute ago.

925
01:02:29,669 --> 01:02:31,534
There it is.
Huh?

926
01:02:31,804 --> 01:02:33,135
There.
Where?

927
01:02:33,206 --> 01:02:34,434
There.
Huh?

928
01:02:34,507 --> 01:02:36,031
On the end of your club,
Sam.

929
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:39,135
So it is, so it is!

930
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:41,874
What a dunce I feel like. Oh!

931
01:02:42,515 --> 01:02:44,380
Stop that, will you!

932
01:02:45,818 --> 01:02:47,809
You stand clear and keep
your eye on this ball!

933
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:51,614
Excuse me, please. Excuse
me, please. Excuse me, please.

934
01:02:51,824 --> 01:02:54,019
Is that Mr. Bisbee?
Yes, Sam Bisbee.

935
01:02:54,093 --> 01:02:55,583
Oh, thanks.

936
01:02:55,962 --> 01:02:59,227
Stand clear, boy,
and keep your eye on the ball.

937
01:02:59,732 --> 01:03:02,530
Mr. Bisbee! Robbins,
National Tire Company.

938
01:03:02,602 --> 01:03:04,900
Yeah, glad to see you again,
Mr. Robbins.

939
01:03:04,971 --> 01:03:06,905
We found your car,
tested your tires.

940
01:03:06,973 --> 01:03:09,305
I'm prepared to make you a
reasonable offer for your invention.

941
01:03:09,375 --> 01:03:11,843
How much?
$20,000.

942
01:03:11,911 --> 01:03:14,277
Just a moment, Sam. Is that
for your puncture-proof tire?

943
01:03:14,347 --> 01:03:15,541
Yes, it is.
Ridiculous!

944
01:03:15,615 --> 01:03:17,845
I'm prepared to offer
$50,000 for the patent.

945
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:19,441
I beg pardon.
And who are you?

946
01:03:19,519 --> 01:03:20,781
I'm the Princess Lescaboura,

947
01:03:20,853 --> 01:03:22,218
and I want the rights
for my country.

948
01:03:22,288 --> 01:03:23,585
Well, I won't haggle.

949
01:03:23,656 --> 01:03:24,645
$75,000!

950
01:03:24,724 --> 01:03:25,713
$90,000!

951
01:03:25,792 --> 01:03:28,317
$150,000!
$300,000.

952
01:03:28,394 --> 01:03:30,487
$400,000!
$500,000!

953
01:03:30,563 --> 01:03:33,623
$600,000!
$750,000!

954
01:03:33,699 --> 01:03:35,633
I'll give you
a million dollars

955
01:03:35,701 --> 01:03:37,760
and a royalty on
every tire manufactured!

956
01:03:37,837 --> 01:03:40,169
Sold to the gentleman
with the Panama hat!

957
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,901
Here's a check
for $50,000. $50,000!

958
01:03:47,113 --> 01:03:50,344
You take this check!
Grab this check! Here!

959
01:03:50,416 --> 01:03:51,781
Sam!

960
01:03:53,486 --> 01:03:54,976
Goodbye, my bun.

961
01:03:57,990 --> 01:03:59,855
Goodbye, Mr. Bisbee.
Goodbye, Mrs. Murchison.

962
01:03:59,926 --> 01:04:02,121
Goodbye, Bisbee.
Goodbye, Murchie.

963
01:04:02,195 --> 01:04:04,891
Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, Marie.

964
01:04:04,964 --> 01:04:06,659
I want to thank you
for a lot of fun.

965
01:04:06,732 --> 01:04:08,199
The pleasure's mutual.

966
01:04:08,968 --> 01:04:12,199
We certainly put that
princess stuff over, didn't we?

967
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:14,068
You're telling me!

968
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:16,972
Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, Marie.

969
01:04:17,043 --> 01:04:19,238
Goodbye! Goodbye, Sam. Goodbye now...

970
01:04:19,312 --> 01:04:20,973
Don't forget...
Bye, Peter.

971
01:04:21,047 --> 01:04:23,311
Goodbye!
Don't forget to...

972
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:26,283
Don't... Don't forget to send
me a postcard from Niagara Falls!

973
01:04:26,352 --> 01:04:29,651
Boys, we're off to the races.
Take that.

974
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,360
Now, if anybody wants me
for the next two weeks,

975
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:38,329
I'll be in conference.

976
01:04:40,132 --> 01:04:42,191
Right about face!

977
01:04:43,369 --> 01:04:45,837
Forward march!

978
01:04:46,739 --> 01:04:48,331
What a relief!

979
01:04:52,411 --> 01:04:54,003
They've gone.

980
01:04:54,747 --> 01:04:56,715
Charlie, open that bag.

981
01:04:59,185 --> 01:05:02,586
This'll be the first real
drink I've had in months.
