1
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,199
Evening, Victorine.

2
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,960
- At last!
Wipe your feet.

3
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,833
Arriving at this time.

4
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,112
That's all you can say after 15 years?

5
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,757
- You haven't changed. It's like
I saw you yesterday. - Really?

6
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,191
You've always looked older

7
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,639
When I think of what happened here...

8
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,671
What a spectacle!

9
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,713
"Spectacle"?
Murder, shootings, and all the rest?

10
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,717
It could've been worse.

11
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,230
You're lucky you weren't
arrested straightaway.

12
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,237
You were clearly involved.

13
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,149
Did everybody show up?
Yes,and on time!

14
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,316
There?
You know the way.

15
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,353
Don't ruin my carpets
with your cigarettes.

16
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,715
What a memory!

17
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,878
I hope you didn't marry some poor woman.

18
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,116
Married, divorced and remarried!

19
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,472
No! Not Maruval...
My name's "Marinval"

20
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,638
Castille, my brother, our friend, 
leader.
You deserved a minute of silence.

21
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,833
Fifteen years ago, on this day,
in this house

22
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,352
a few days before the Liberation,
you were shot down by the German police.

23
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,753
All of us witnessed that tragic event,

24
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,794
Which is why we are
gathered tonight in this house.

25
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,798
In our former HQ.

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,309
It's long overdue.

27
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,354
War and defeat brought us together.

28
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,949
Peace tore us apart.

29
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,310
The Vaillance network, your network.

30
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,878
Has become a cherished part of our 
lives.
Like a memorable vacation.

31
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,878
We're alumni of sorts.

32
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:43,436
But although we haven't always kept in
touch, we've remained true to your 
values.

33
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,031
Castille, you're everywhere we go.

34
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,879
We've never
stopped thinking about you...

35
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,629
and the freedom that cost you your life.

36
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,470
That freedom for which too many died,
is a symbol of eternal hope

37
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,593
And because I know
you want us to do this.

38
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,191
I raise my glass
to our flower, our good luck charm,

39
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,110
and, dare I say it, our heroine,
though you abhorred the term.

40
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,471
To Marie-Octobre,
who organized this gathering.

41
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,797
And for that, we are very grateful.

42
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,549
Castille, I'm proud
and honored to have known you.

43
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,753
To Castille.

44
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,195
- To Marie-Octobre
- To good heath.

45
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,596
Marinval, still punctual.

46
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,076
Sorry, I was pulled over by the police.

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,072
I couldn't find a cab,so I walked.

48
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,840
I told Renaud Picart
I'd be in a meeting.

49
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,474
He chairs the butchers' association.

50
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,672
Aren't you embarrassed?

51
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,835
Au poteau!

52
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,791
Il y a longtemps?

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,116
We're like family. Shall we kiss?

54
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,036
Of course.

55
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,230
Here.

56
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,509
For me?

57
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,439
A little something for old times' sake.

58
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,200
There were good days and bad days...

59
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,753
Oh!

60
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,188
A led of lamb!

61
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,118
And a bread card. How sweet!

62
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,312
He kept it frozen for 15 years.

63
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,239
The lamb was killed yesterday.

64
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,953
Merci, Victorine.

65
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,234
Recognize me?

66
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,715
Counselor Simoneau.
I saw your photo in the paper.

67
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,638
You've lost your hair and gained weight.

68
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,796
So now you defend murderers?

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,035
At your service.

70
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,958
I'm an SPCA member.

71
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,639
Self-defense.

72
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,795
Idiot!

73
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,995
No!

74
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,390
No!

75
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,635
Yes.

76
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,670
Le Gueven!

77
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,835
That's right.

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,828
You had a bright future.
All your conquests...

79
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,519
When did you...?

80
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,948
Ten years ago.

81
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,075
To think you were a real ladies' man!

82
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,034
Bernardi,I heard you gave up wrestling.

83
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,070
True.

84
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,397
- Did you have dinner?
- I'm starving. What'd you eat?

85
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,636
A delicious duck a I'orange

86
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,072
And fish that tasted like chicken.
- The appetizer...

87
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,395
I want it all!

88
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,478
Serve Mr. Marinval. We'll have coffee 
here.

89
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,591
I set the service in the living room.

90
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,997
Then I'll eat in the living room.

91
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,873
I want to sample everything. Victorine.

92
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,752
My poor carpets.

93
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,308
C'est pas marrant.

94
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,909
How old is your son?

95
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,870
Fifteen.

96
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,232
I can't diagnose him at a distance.

97
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,158
Medicine has its limits.

98
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,399
I'm not trying to cheat you out of a 
consultation fee.

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,149
With our programs,we can afford any 
disease.

100
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,920
Yes, cancer is no longer a luxury.

101
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,912
You didn't invite me.

102
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,190
It was a small wedding.

103
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,150
Et puis?

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,351
You tell your friends just good news,no?

105
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,788
You're not happy?

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,437
I didn't marry the true love of my life.

107
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,034
Oh, mais j'aime!

108
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,357
But I love my job,good books and music.

109
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,312
And I really love coffee.

110
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,478
If you want coffee,raise your hand.

111
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,275
- I asked for herbal tea. -Here it is.
It's my liver.

112
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,351
People look at me and say:"It's your 
liver".
- You don't say.

113
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,597
That's the sugar.
- Coffee?

114
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,791
No,never at night.

115
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,316
Piano

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,830
Merci.

117
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,715
Thibaud doesn't belive you own the 
Marie-Octobre couture house.
- Really?

118
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,876
I didn't make the connection.

119
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,991
For a Parisian doctor...

120
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,191
I figured you married an explorer,

121
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,915
someone like Paul-Emile Victor.

122
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,758
No,I never married.

123
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,995
Why not?

124
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,395
Who knows?

125
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,992
The couture house...
- It's a major player,no?

126
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,428
Indeed..

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,598
Thanks to this gentleman. Meet my 
silent partner.

128
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,315
I made a wise investment. With 
honorable intentions.

129
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,839
He's defensive.

130
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,989
I didn't say "With honorable 
intentions."
I said,"With honorable intentions".

131
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,839
Marie has a flawless heart of gold.

132
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,189
And closed.

133
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,954
Love was grand before the war.

134
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,196
How would you know?You were 14.

135
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,391
I knew quite a bit.

136
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,269
Simoneau!

137
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,919
Tell me the truth.
- The defendant,yesterday...

138
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,872
The one I acquitted?

139
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,390
He was guilty.
- He fired the shot.

140
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,919
They couldn't prove it.

141
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,078
You can't believe he was innocent!

142
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,158
My feelings don't come into play.

143
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,148
He didn't fool me. He who kills must be 
killed.

144
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,237
Simplistic reasoning.

145
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,998
Strange profession.
Not yours?

146
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,751
My clients thank me,yours curse you.

147
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:20,714
- You're fearsome.
- Thanks. But I'm respected.

148
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,152
The guilty get jailed. I'm proud of my 
profession.

149
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,110
You are...?

150
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,070
Civil servant.

151
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,840
A super civil servant!Tell him what you 
do.

152
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,155
Fine.

153
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,110
Then spit it out.

154
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,435
I will!

155
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,993
Well?

156
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,713
I'm a tax inspector.

157
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,239
Oh! Dur!

158
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,429
The lowlife!

159
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,439
Let's watch TV.

160
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,599
There's a great wrestling match tonight.
- Interested?- At my age...

161
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,314
I'm a rabid wrestling fan.

162
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,477
So you stopped wrestling?

163
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,549
I quit when I seriously injured my back.
It's a young man's sport.

164
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,716
Shall I call you "Father"?

165
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,912
Are you kidding?Call me Yves,

166
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
You haven't lost your touch.

167
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,158
I play saxophone too.

168
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,634
Really?

169
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,230
Piano

170
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,230
I'm not particularly fond of that.

171
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,908
I'm into the Romantic 
composers:Berlioz,but especially Wagner.

172
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,033
Tristan,Tannhauser,The Ride of the 
Valkyries!

173
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,150
Scientists predict that this device...

174
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,436
...will one day replace the 
refrigerator.

175
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,191
Right!Sounds like science fiction to me.

176
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,915
It's a cultural program. What time is 
it?

177
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,190
Wrestling is on later.

178
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,351
You don't have a TV?

179
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,915
No,for drama i have my wife.

180
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,788
Thanks,Victorine.

181
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,470
Married?

182
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,672
Common-law. You know Linda Bell?

183
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,791
The singer?

184
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,629
"Come to my place On the sixth floor

185
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,991
"Then you'll..."My Panorama. I've heard 
her records.

186
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,796
At home,I get to sample...
... the live version!

187
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,279
What else?

188
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,631
I run a nightclub,Sexy Pigalle.

189
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,155
Really?

190
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,152
How interesting!

191
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,558
A first class joint. Authetic 
stripteases.

192
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,909
You musn't get bored.

193
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,076
I'm never bored at work.

194
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,475
I'd love to take a tour!

195
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,591
You're welcome to come.

196
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,270
I bought the place in '45.It cost me 
two million F.

197
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,313
But we feature great artists.

198
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,752
Anyone can put up a sign that 
says,"Striptease"
- But running a striptease...

199
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,234
That's right!

200
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,068
That's swell,no?

201
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,397
You feel it. Unlike...

202
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,355
Say...

203
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,874
Remember the song we used to sing in 
'42 or '43?

204
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:20,910
Euh...

205
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,350
No,it was a little silly,yet charming.

206
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,994
You know...

207
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,758
The Bonaparte St. song. You used to 
sing it.

208
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,270
That's it.
You'd play your mandolin.

209
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,230
Oh!

210
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,192
Keep playing.

211
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,670
Thank you.

212
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,632
My hospital was thriving.

213
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,918
I was making a name for myself

214
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,190
But then I lost my wife.

215
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,517
No children. I wanted to pack it in.

216
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,551
But I cared about my patients.

217
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,115
If I lost my wife,I'd be devastated.

218
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,232
I get along with my son. He helps out 
at the forge.

219
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,353
I'm worried about my daughter. She's 14 
and in love with me.

220
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,996
And she's so pretty!Men shouldn't have 
daughters.

221
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,196
Shall we do this?Go first,then I'll 
take over.

222
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,597
Can I count on you?

223
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,995
Sure you won't regret it?

224
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,270
You know me better than that.

225
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,632
Marie,you owe me this dance. You 
promised me,remember?

226
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,316
In that case...

227
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,149
That melody...

228
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,750
- Bonaparte St.
The small boutique

229
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,235
Where we sent our letters.
- What times!

230
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,273
- Wonderful.
- I'd see you every day.

231
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,799
Go on!

232
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:02,796
May I cut in?

233
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,470
Not always the same.
I need to talk to her too.

234
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,878
You were decorated?

235
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,073
- Clients are impressed.
My fees can go up.

236
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,791
And I'm single.

237
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,149
- Really?
- Yes.

238
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,915
Like you.

239
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,030
Meaning?

240
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,356
Just thought I'd mention it.

241
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,839
What's wrong?

242
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,835
Are you worried?

243
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,355
No?

244
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,949
You're up to something.

245
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,354
Yes,actually...

246
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,275
Four-man tag team match!

247
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,996
Best of three falls.
The European championship belt is on 
the line.

248
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,953
The team of Delaporte and Villar...

249
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,550
Yes,the infamous Delaporte,along with 
Villar,

250
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,070
will try to defeat Zick 400

251
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,679
and King Kong Tavern.

252
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:21,034
Plenty of action on tap.
The ref's got his work cut out.

253
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,559
- We can't hear anything.
- Just listen up...

254
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,236
Later,Victorine. Now's not the time.

255
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,113
What's going on?

256
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,910
At the fourth stroke...

257
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,519
Shut up!

258
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,198
Haven't you been wondering why.

259
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,758
after 15 years,
Marie-Octobre felt the need to see you 
again?

260
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,235
Aren't you curious to know?

261
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,953
She missed us.

262
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:01,873
I'll tell you.

263
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,868
Fifteen years ago,the Gestapo stormed 
into this house.

264
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,753
By some miracle,we all escaped unharmed.

265
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,599
Except for Castille.

266
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,631
Castille was killed by a German 
policeman

267
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,638
right where I'm standing.

268
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,193
Our network was dispersed.

269
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,436
- Then came the Liberation.
- Whew!

270
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,475
We didn't keep in touch.
Sure,sometimes we'd run into each other.

271
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,479
But with indifference.

272
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,318
Don't exaggerate.

273
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,435
I've often wondered how the Gestapo had 
been tipped off.

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,118
How could it know where and when our 
meeting was being held?

275
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,949
That question has remained unanswered 
for 15 years.

276
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,118
But there is no God for traitors.

277
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,753
What are you saying?

278
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,993
What information do you have?

279
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,800
The network was rattled out.

280
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,752
We suspected as much.

281
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,589
By one of its own members.

282
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,552
By one of us.

283
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,475
What?

284
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,232
"By one of us"?

285
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,910
- Is this a joke?
How outrageous!

286
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,918
What nonsense!I'd rather watch TV.

287
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,670
It's true:One of us ratted out the 
network to the Gestapo.

288
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,756
- Are you...?
- I mean,really!

289
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,428
A traitor?I doubt it.

290
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,756
Can you name him?Who is it?

291
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,555
You.

292
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,996
You.

293
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,035
You.

294
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,749
You.

295
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,310
Everyone and no one.

296
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,239
So what if there's an extra Judas,right?

297
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,638
Marie-Octobre's accusation must be 
taken seriously.

298
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,156
Two weeks ago,I released my winter 
collection.

299
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,960
During the show,a man kept staring at 
me so intently

300
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,870
that after the show,I asked him what he 
wanted.

301
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,229
And?

302
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,760
"The name Marie-Octobre",he said.

303
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,077
"The name you gave your shop..."

304
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,114
"Wasn't it a secret code name during 
the Occupation?"

305
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,230
"Why do you ask?"

306
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,070
"Because Marie-Octobre's network gave 
me a hard time."

307
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,911
He was a German buyer.
His name is Wilfrid Muller.

308
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,318
He was a German officer who worked with 
the Gestapo.

309
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,432
Designers meet interesting people.

310
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,516
What else?

311
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,754
Then he made a staggering assertion:

312
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,590
"We uncovered your network thanks 
solely to a traitor.

313
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,554
"You were rattled out by one of your 
own members."

314
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,913
"One of your own members."

315
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,833
Then he added sincerely,I'm sure,

316
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,952
"Too bad,you didn't deserve it.

317
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,232
"I admired your courage."

318
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,389
That's it.

319
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,079
No name?He didn't give a name?

320
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,997
He couldn't remember it.

321
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,395
Sounds like malarkey to me!

322
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,309
He waited 15 years to...?No,I don't buy 
it.

323
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,071
We're victims of a fabrication,
an anonymous denunciation or an act of 
revenge.

324
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,909
But that you,that he,that I... No, my 
friend.

325
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,192
We're upstanding citizens. In my heart 
I know...

326
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,789
Savingthe closing arguments for later.

327
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,910
Supposing...

328
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,035
some bastard did talk to the buyer
to rat out the network.

329
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,391
He could've pretended to be Marinval or 
me.

330
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,272
Can I say something?

331
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,951
Isn't there a statute of limitations?

332
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,396
Then I'll confess...

333
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,236
I rattled out the network.

334
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,229
In a moment of madness.

335
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,910
Happy?
Then let's move on to more serious 
things.

336
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,429
Et voyons ou en
sont ces messieurs!

337
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,715
Delaporte managed to break the hold.

338
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,115
He's out for blood!The ref tries to 
step in.

339
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,949
Delaporte sends him flying.

340
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:40,910
He's determined to wreak

341
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,715
mayhem in the ring and to...

342
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,869
What's the big idea?

343
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,878
I disagree.

344
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,749
Either too much was said or not enough.

345
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,875
We keep complimenting each other:
"Your're a great guy."Not as great as 
you."

346
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,398
- So?
- Let's prove we're great guys.

347
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,239
Let's take inventory.

348
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,911
Yes. If we were to end the evening now,

349
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,236
our good-byes would ring hollow.

350
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,556
That seed of doubt has been planted.

351
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,911
Doubt is a cancer without equal,isn't 
it,doctor?

352
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,317
You insist on doing this,huh?

353
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,429
Great.

354
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,552
And the traitor will receive a prize.

355
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,911
We're all gonna have a good time!

356
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,315
You're being flippant.

357
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,956
- I have a right to my opinion.
- You have every right.

358
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,312
Sure,horse around at inopportune 
moments.

359
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,919
He who laughs last...

360
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,758
You insinuating...?

361
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,389
Nothing.

362
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,518
You assume...?

363
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,434
I assume nothing.

364
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,435
I've always shied away from showdowns.

365
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,518
You're twisting yourselves a know over 
a faraway event.

366
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,073
I leave the past behind me.

367
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,238
But I'm at your service.
Just like your auditors.

368
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,116
Here are my books:
Marinval plays by the rules. Yes,tax 
inspector.

369
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,070
Glad to hear it.

370
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,235
At least you are.

371
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,592
I had to fork over an extra 25% in 
taxes.
not to mention the fines

372
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,916
because of a minor accounting error...

373
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,712
But you play by the rules?

374
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,150
I have a clear conscience.

375
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,549
Are you quite sure?

376
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,715
That's not the point.

377
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,672
He's horsing around again.

378
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,599
You can be so witty!

379
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,315
All of us,then,get to be the judge and 
the accused.

380
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,832
Yes,but then what?
What'll we do with the culprit?

381
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,430
Good point.
What if I were to confess?

382
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,271
What then?

383
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,359
Would I grab my hat and say,"Good 
night,everyone"?
- Life goes on?

384
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,429
Traitors were executed in '42.

385
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,312
This isn't 1942.

386
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,591
So it's too late for justice?

387
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,509
We're past that point. It's too late to 
punish anyone.

388
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,918
No,not the culprit.
And he's right here.

389
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,590
He dined with us. He must be punished.

390
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,679
It happened 15 years ago. He's changed.

391
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,519
Maybe he can't understand what the past 
means.

392
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,996
Are you pleading your case?

393
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,519
I'm not pleading.

394
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,189
I'm praying for everyone.

395
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,197
Le Gueven is right.

396
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,029
We have no right to execute anyone.

397
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,037
I wouldn't have the guts.

398
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,595
And I certainly wouldn't.

399
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,394
A condemned man who was pardoned wrote,

400
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,149
"To kill with a clear conscience,you 
need faith.

401
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,239
"Or you kill out of fear or 
revenge,which is repugnant."

402
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,079
I must admit I don't have much faith 
tonight.

403
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,158
Besides,before the courts,

404
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,954
perhaps a sentence would be given,

405
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,037
but surely not enforced.

406
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,719
I see...

407
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,229
You sure have changed!

408
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,910
A snitch is a snitch. Show him no mercy!

409
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,792
Bravo. Spoken like a real man.

410
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,679
Let's kill the culprit.

411
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,553
You'll be the hangman.

412
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,510
The "hangman"?

413
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,429
You judge,you sentence,so you execute.

414
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,838
Certainly,if the accused confesses.

415
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,391
Actually,maybe. It depends on the 
circumstances.

416
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,038
So we wipe the state clean?

417
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,516
The network,Castille... Let's write 
everything off!

418
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,475
We'll never be able to look at each 
other again,my friends.

419
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,999
We'll no longer be friends.

420
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,033
We'll be suspects.

421
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:45,111
You sentenced Simon to death in '43,and 
I did the dirty work.

422
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,677
If you let the traitor walk,
Simon becomes a victim of injustice.

423
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,873
And I become a complete and utter 
bastard!

424
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,274
You Pontius Pilates!

425
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,675
You wash your hands because they're 
dirty.

426
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,235
We can't allow the situation to persist.

427
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,149
We may not be 13,but there's a Judas 
among us.

428
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,759
Maybe your brother did it.

429
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,871
Very funny.

430
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,517
- I don't know what to do.
- I do. I have a solution.

431
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,508
Suicide.

432
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,639
Do you agree?

433
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,268
OK.If I disagree,you'll assume I'm 
guilty,so...

434
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,229
I agree as well.

435
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,876
After all,a traitor won't rat himself 
out.

436
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,990
You never know.

437
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,150
I agree.

438
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,918
But I don't.

439
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:01,309
It's a hypocritical solution.
We can't take justice into our own 
hands.

440
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,635
If you want something done...

441
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,115
Please listen to me!

442
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,993
- Let God...
- We've heard it all before.

443
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,239
Your God can't save an innocent life.

444
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,874
Where was He during the Crucifixion?

445
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,469
- God Almighty! -Sacrilege.
Idiot.

446
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,515
What if the culprit won't kill himself?

447
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,870
I'll know exactly what to do.

448
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,640
You'll find me in your way.

449
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:28,995
Fine.

450
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,233
Have you thought about the 
consequences,Renaud?

451
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,352
What will you tell the police?

452
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,120
There'll a corpse in your home.

453
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:43,552
The traitor's confession and suicide 
will be on paper.

454
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,513
- The corpse's discharge!
- The corpse... Whose?

455
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,918
It's as though we're all innocent!

456
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,159
Yes,all of us are innocent.
- Except for one man.

457
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,999
Or woman!I'm sorry,but...

458
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,236
In short,

459
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,475
it's crystal clear:

460
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,993
One of us won't walkk out of here alive.

461
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,350
- Right?
- Dr. Thibaud,you have a call.

462
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,235
Dr. Thibaud?

463
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,075
Thibaud...

464
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,990
Let's sit down. We keep walking 
around...

465
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,758
Victorine,fetch the liqueurs.

466
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,318
No,Marinval!

467
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:40,110
Before I die,I wanna know who wins!

468
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:00,033
Didja see that hold?Incredible.
Take a look.

469
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,674
That's a waste of time. Come along.

470
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,559
My patients are getting antsy. I should 
be with them.

471
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,829
Perhaps.

472
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,752
Whisky,raspberry liqueur?

473
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,269
- The last glass.
- The last cigarette?

474
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,629
Thanks.

475
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,434
So how shall we proceed?

476
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,755
You're the jurist.

477
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,349
Yes,but this is illegal.

478
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,595
Like in '43.

479
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,510
Let's focus on those who had contacts 
with the Germans:no?

480
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,438
Dealings with the enemy.

481
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,356
Not necessarily.

482
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,758
During the Occupation,Frenchmen had 
contacts with the enemy.

483
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,315
I defended them at German trials.

484
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,989
What about you?

485
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,433
What about me?

486
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,791
During the Occupation,you had dealings 
with the Krauts,no?

487
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,319
That's news to me!

488
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,636
Black market dealings.

489
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,195
I made sure we had food.

490
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,515
What about the crap?

491
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,470
What?

492
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,958
Where was it from?You had to grease 
their palms.

493
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,593
Now that's rich!

494
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,949
Hear that?

495
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,153
Who gave you fresh food?Who sent 
parcels to Fresnes?

496
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,396
The butter tasted great,didn't it?

497
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,720
You want a statue for your achievements?
Honor and fat content!

498
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,595
My goal was to dupe them.
- But you obeyed them.

499
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,516
"Obeyed"?

500
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,233
You were a civil servant!

501
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,192
I was loyal to my superiors.

502
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,312
You skipped a scheduled meeting.

503
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,274
We were friends and I didn't know what 
he was planning.

504
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:38,472
Remeber?In February or March 1942.

505
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,795
February 1942?

506
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,310
- Yes.
- Saint-Denis subway station.

507
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,430
It's possible.

508
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,710
You never showed. Why?

509
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,478
I have no idea.

510
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,432
You'd been arrested.

511
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,358
Yes,that one time.

512
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:56,553
The Germans had raided my apartment 
building.

513
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,150
- But they arrested you?
- And every single tenant.

514
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,069
- They kept you in custody?
- For 48 hours. ID check.

515
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,555
- Then they released you?
- Yes.

516
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,954
Just like that?

517
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,832
Yes,"just like that."

518
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,112
What about Costa,Daumont and Verger?

519
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,959
They were arrested,but never seen again.

520
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,354
So what?

521
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,879
So there!

522
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,068
I'm afraid we're starting to stray.

523
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,194
And didn't you used to print German 
weeklies?

524
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,755
The publishing house where I worked 
printed them.

525
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,236
It meant I could make fake IDs.

526
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,956
And leaflets and passports. Remember?

527
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,912
- You'd give me sketches.
- Yes.

528
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,270
The first time I met him,he was 
speaking German

529
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,392
- with a propaganda officer.
- My foreign language.

530
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,594
When you asked about the network,
I was convinced you were a spy.

531
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,798
Then I trusted you...

532
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,878
...but I was mostly drawn to you.

533
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,829
We're going nowhere fast.

534
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:09,717
Let's try to remember
what happened the night the Gestapo 
raided the place.

535
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:13,674
I must've beaten the world record for 
the 100-meter dash.

536
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,075
That night's dinner...

537
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,554
What about it?

538
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,352
It didn't go down well.

539
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,438
You overeat and don't chew properly.

540
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,039
Dinner was...?

541
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,277
- Coq au vin.
You're still digesting it.

542
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,789
You're not exactly a gourmet!

543
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,639
- Still enjoy coq au vin?
- I still do.

544
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,070
Your culinary tastes haven't changed.

545
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,875
But I'm rather taken aback by...

546
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,234
How you lusted after young women's 
thighs!

547
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,797
I'll never forget that.

548
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,194
It's not true.

549
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,757
But you're still a handsome young man.
When you run into your ex-girlfriends,

550
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,234
what do you tell them?

551
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,237
Leave us the hell alone!

552
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:03,195
Don't talk to me like that.
Or they'll think I raised you wrong.

553
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,833
We had all gathered here that night 
with Castille.

554
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,629
No.

555
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,514
No,not all of us. Some of us weren't 
present.

556
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,910
Are you sure?

557
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,235
Quite.

558
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,432
Then they'll get blamed. If we need a 
suspect...

559
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,236
If I had denounced the network,I 
would've avoided the meeting.

560
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,035
To avoid a shootout. But I was present!

561
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,155
So was I.

562
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,476
So was I.

563
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,874
So was I.

564
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,435
But I wasn't.

565
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,959
Where were you?

566
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,832
Don't worry,I have an alibi.

567
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,555
Four days earliers,Castille had sent me 
to Saint-Malo.

568
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,115
It took four days to come back?

569
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,835
Yes.
Rouen was being bombarded.

570
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,390
Really?

571
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,158
I don't recall that at all.

572
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,155
But Rouen's citizens haven't forgotten.

573
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,156
Blanchet.

574
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,477
You weren't there that night either.

575
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,477
That's right.

576
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,274
- Why not say so?
- I'm telling you!

577
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,552
I had a very high fever.

578
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,594
My wife insisted I should'nt go,so I 
stayed in bed.

579
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,438
Why didn't you warn us?

580
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,039
I called.

581
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:34,152
- You didn't have a phone.
- From the next-door bistro!

582
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,751
- So you went out anyway?
- No,my wife phoned.

583
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,279
Who took the call?

584
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,630
I don't know. Castille,probably.

585
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:46,719
- He's dead,he won't deny it.
- Stop pissing me off!

586
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,229
My wife called!Got it?

587
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,034
It happened 15 years ago,so...

588
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:57,717
But tragic events are never easily 
forgotten.

589
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,629
True.
You had an altercation...

590
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,628
with Castille shortly before he died.

591
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,149
What was behind it?

592
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:12,797
An "altercation"?
Castille and I often quarreled.

593
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,231
We didn't share the same vision for the 
network.

594
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,116
Castille was a remarkable man,
yet profoundly inhuman.

595
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,232
An intransigent doctrinarian.

596
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,592
On the contrary,he exhibited great 
sensitivity.

597
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,271
I admit I was hotheaded and 
temperamental.

598
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,234
A loose cannon.

599
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,635
Some squabbles,nothing serious.

600
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,869
"Nothing serious"?

601
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,993
I jumped in before someone got hurt.

602
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,873
A punch can be a philosophical argument.

603
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,399
Or Christian charity?

604
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,952
What were you fighting over?

605
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,357
Wasn't there a rivalry between you?Well?

606
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,319
None that I know of.

607
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,119
I'm sorry,but...

608
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,638
Don't you think

609
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:12,630
you had something to do with it?

610
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,674
Le Gueven?

611
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,398
My feelings for Marie-Octobre
were strictly fraternal.

612
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,274
Either you forgot what you were like.

613
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:30,190
or you have a peculiar notion of the 
term "fraternal."

614
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,510
I remember the night we were alone at 
your place.

615
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,678
And that night,you were most eloquent.

616
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,519
What would've become of us

617
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:44,951
if the air raid warning hadn't sounded?

618
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,232
Women led you to God.

619
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,233
Le Gueven.

620
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,718
why were you and Castille ready to come 
to blows?

621
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:08,435
It's best to come clean.

622
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,189
Spit it out. What are you worried about?

623
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,073
I'm concerned about you,not me.

624
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,272
Aren't you miserable?

625
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,349
The unjustly accused can't help but be 
miserable.

626
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,195
I can't tell you that.

627
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,556
Castille claimed you stole three 
million F.

628
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,070
Is that true?

629
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,475
Yes,it is.

630
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,836
Three million,back then...

631
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,633
We had received large sums of money 
from London
to support various network activities.

632
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,831
That's why I went to Saint-Malo.

633
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,549
But the three million F Castille kept 
with him had disappered.

634
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,397
What was his motive for accusing you?

635
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,637
I led,in those days,aside from our 
activities,

636
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,276
a rather turbulent and expensive 
lifestyle.

637
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,835
Spendthrift!

638
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,077
- I was debt-ridden.
But that doesn't mean...

639
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,633
When Castille confronted me...

640
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,798
I was belligerent,so I didn't react 
well.

641
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,036
Luckily,you broke it up.

642
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,309
Makes sense.

643
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,350
What?

644
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,632
The devil tempted him,but God beckoned 
him.

645
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,391
- If Castille accused you...
- I didn't steal!Believe me?

646
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,555
Not for a second.

647
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,795
You should.

648
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,438
Le Gueven didn't do it. Castille said 
so the next day.

649
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,840
The thief was never caught?

650
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,191
A matter of minutes.

651
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:52,479
Castille was going to unmask him during 
the last meeting.

652
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,833
He never got the chance.

653
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,190
"During the last meeting"?

654
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,396
Castille walked in through that door 
and told me,

655
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,559
"The thief is here."

656
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,318
It was a close call for one of us.

657
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,078
Saved by the Gestapo.

658
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,235
Exactly.

659
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,513
It's all water under the bridge.

660
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,472
You don't care,you're alive.

661
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,069
But through no fault of my own.

662
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,068
They missed me three times. Maybe 
you're sorry!

663
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,713
I'm "alive"!

664
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,912
What if being alive suits me just fine?

665
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,795
But not me!Not until Castille's death 
is avenged.

666
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,314
I don't know what Castille meant to you,
but I've never met anybody like him.

667
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,596
We served in the Corps Francs in 1940.

668
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,113
I survived thanks to him.
I owe him everything!

669
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,469
Before I met him,I was a lout,a crook.

670
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,116
But he made me a man. I walk with my 
head held high!

671
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,791
If he could hear me,

672
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,879
I'd tell him, "Mr Castille,you'll be 
avenged tonight!

673
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,275
"It's an honor to salute you."

674
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,031
I was very fond of Castille too.

675
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,752
You never wanted to disappoint him.

676
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,191
Yes,you wanted him to think highly of 
you.

677
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,437
Then let's see this through,to remain 
true to him.

678
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,678
Whoever ratted us out didn't only 
betray Castille,
he also betrayed all of those we never 
saw again.

679
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,952
- Those who never came back.
- Hold on.

680
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,393
Is the theft and betrayal a cause and 
effect relationship?

681
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,508
Possibly.

682
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,919
The money was spent somehow!He hid it 
initially,and then...

683
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,989
You...

684
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,628
It seems you have a large practice.
Practices are costly.

685
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,638
You were broke then. You worked in a 
garage.

686
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,673
Yes,at night. To pay for my education.

687
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,953
I wanted to lend you some money.

688
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,435
I didn't want to owe anyone.

689
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,232
Your practice opened in '46.

690
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,952
Yes,and it cost over three million.

691
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,079
An inheritance?

692
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,871
Dr. Carelli's practice. I married his 
daughter.

693
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,833
When he retired,I took over his 
patients.

694
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,034
Your methods aren't tinged with 
subtlely.

695
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,629
He thinks he's performing again.

696
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,159
Defending blows!

697
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,634
Like a wrestler.

698
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,594
Stick to slaughter,butcher!

699
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,916
Bravo!How classy!

700
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,477
Mind you,he knows plenty about the meat 
market.

701
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:43,470
By the way,
did you also inherit your fine arts 
shop from your grandmother?

702
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,478
We all know what you were up to in 
Puteaux!

703
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,033
Bernadi!

704
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,714
I'm sorry,I was way out of line.

705
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,070
Marinval!

706
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,433
I'd like you to do something.

707
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,909
Go back in time and tell me

708
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,830
if you've ever questioned a network 
member's loyalty.

709
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:18,916
Simoneau?

710
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,955
- Never.
External betrayals,yes.

711
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,036
Blanchet?

712
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,471
I had doubts at time,but never any 
proof.

713
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,113
It's all so long ago.

714
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,915
- But I have!
I suspected someone,and I still do.

715
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,237
You all suspected him too.

716
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,429
- His name's on the tip of...
- Who is it?

717
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,832
No,that'd be too easy.

718
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,589
- Have the courage to speak.
- I'm keeping the name secret.

719
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,950
- So you won't answer?
- Yes.

720
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,114
My way.

721
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,270
Vandamme has voted. Your turn.

722
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:28,113
Come on!Let's see if we agree.

723
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,275
This is rather...

724
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,429
But in case anyone...

725
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,157
Now maybe the truth will finally come 
out.

726
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,952
You believe in Santa Claus?

727
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,714
Le Gueven.

728
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,469
I mean...

729
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:16,229
- You refuse to vote?
- Yes.

730
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:21,036
The vote will foster hatred. Count me 
out.

731
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,117
- I don't hate anyone.
- Hatred!

732
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,469
And here comes King Kong,

733
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,878
who's intent on teaching Villar a 
lession he'll never forget.

734
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,355
The blows are raining down...

735
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,191
Simoneau's got my vote.

736
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,029
That'll teach him to have murderers 
pardoned.

737
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,589
- So?
- No volunteers?

738
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,269
"Simoneau."

739
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:33,589
"Simoneau."

740
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,589
"Simoneau."

741
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,355
"Simoneau."

742
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,949
A blank vote.

743
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:41,675
Simoneau.

744
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:43,589
Simoneau.

745
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:44,995
Simoneau.

746
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,998
So I'm a traitor?

747
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:14,233
You think I'm a traitor,don't you?

748
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,077
It was a secret vote.

749
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,317
True enough. And one blank vote.

750
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:23,876
I'll never know whose. Happy?

751
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:25,957
It was mine.

752
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,956
I see.

753
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,628
I had no choice.

754
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:33,833
- Regardless of my conviction.
- Your "conviction"?

755
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,235
You vote white,but think black. The 
Last Judgment awaits.

756
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,670
You think I'm a bastard too?

757
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:45,710
I can't be sure.

758
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,037
- Still,you voted yes.
Like Thibaud.

759
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,630
A wrong diagnosis is serious.

760
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,353
We all agree it's you.

761
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:57,950
You were all thinking the same thing.

762
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,196
Yet you said nothing.

763
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,190
You were braver back then.

764
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,994
We didn't consult each other. The 
result...

765
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,237
It wasn't premeditated,right?

766
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,954
A combination of circumstances.

767
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:16,357
But you need evidence.

768
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,471
Or certain presumptions.

769
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,790
What "presumptions"?

770
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,479
You know your origins.

771
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,034
My "origins"?

772
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,117
Yes. In 1934...

773
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,831
En 1934,I was a fascist. That's a fact.

774
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,713
- In the Spanish Civil War...
- I supported Franco.

775
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,558
The France-Germany Committee?

776
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:37,795
De Brinon!

777
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,830
Great!

778
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,077
And after the Armistice,you started,at 
Sorbonne...

779
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,272
The France-Germany University 
Association.

780
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:49,473
A very busy agenda of politically 
charged activities.

781
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:54,310
In 1942,when Germany violated the 
agreements,
I wanted nothing more to do with them.

782
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,634
The Gestapo arrested me!

783
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,231
Fresnes,a transfer to Drancy... That 
counts for something!

784
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,318
You know how I escaped from Drancy.

785
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,273
I never hid anything from Castille.
He introduced me to the network. He 
shielded me.

786
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,040
Would you question his vigilance?

787
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,595
If Castille trusted him...

788
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,233
You suspect me.

789
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,793
But, I have some questions too

790
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,275
We drew a correlation between...

791
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,948
...the theft and the betrayal.

792
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,957
A hypothesis.

793
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,551
Castille told you Le Gueven wasn't the 
thief,right?

794
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,829
Yes.

795
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,554
He was going to unmask the thief,right?

796
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:39,749
Yes.

797
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,275
He said the thief was present?

798
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:46,155
- Yes.
But I was in Rouen!... One of you is 
the thief.

799
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,476
I wasn't there either.

800
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,557
I was sick remember?

801
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,952
He didn't have time.

802
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,993
The Germans came in...

803
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,555
10 minutes after the meeting started.

804
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,591
But during those 10 minutes...

805
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,556
Let's try to reconstruct that 
evening,shall we?

806
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,312
We were sitting at that table.

807
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:17,753
Castille was right here.

808
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,114
I can still see him...

809
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,117
I was sitting here.

810
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,990
And me,right here.

811
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,316
During those 10 minutes...?

812
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:31,277
First,I read a communication from London

813
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,313
about sabotage we were to carry out.

814
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,475
We talked.

815
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,229
Castille needed a map that was in his 
car.

816
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,670
He ordered me to retrieve it.

817
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,711
That's when it all started.

818
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,635
On the grounds,

819
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:55,072
I saw parked cars and Germans with 
machine guns.

820
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,750
So I rushed back here and warned 
everyone.

821
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,958
Castille ordered us to split

822
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,232
- I went to the kitchen to
protect Victorine

823
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,238
Le Gueven and I ran out through that 
door.

824
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,749
The three of us hid together.

825
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,075
In a thicket.

826
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:14,750
And you?

827
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,035
Who? Her?

828
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:19,596
She wanted to stay by Castille's side.
Imagine that!

829
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:24,157
But Castille had left important 
documents in that desk.

830
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:25,679
The London correspondence.

831
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,793
- We both ran back inside.
Disaster ensued.

832
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:34,069
Castille was taking his files. I was 
helping him.

833
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,951
The Germans stormed in.

834
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,830
Castille fired two shots,

835
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,591
but they fired back and Castille went 
down.

836
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,319
Five minutes.

837
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,273
If I'd been armed I'd be dead too.

838
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,435
Then what?

839
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,348
Then they searched the place

840
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,359
And they took me away.

841
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:04,912
When they slowed down on Suresnes 
Bridge,

842
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,829
I bolted from the car and plunged into 
the Seine.

843
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,840
And come what may.

844
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:16,158
Shots rang out. I got hit in the 
shoulder.

845
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,351
They figured I had drowned.

846
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:22,314
He showed up at my place,soaking 
wet,covered in blood...

847
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,636
He told me off!

848
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:27,434
I was busy packing.

849
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,676
I removed the bullet,

850
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,032
then we hid in Limousin.

851
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:36,674
When was Castille killed?

852
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,874
When the Germans barged in.

853
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,870
How long did it take?

854
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,869
I don't know...

855
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:49,872
Five or six seconds.

856
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,710
Two shots,machine-gun fire...

857
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,994
Are you sure?

858
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,872
I almost paid the ultimate price.

859
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,793
Something's not right.

860
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,109
Why?

861
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,548
Sorry to say,but... Something's not 
right.

862
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,069
Your story is flawed.

863
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,196
How?

864
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:23,995
From the time the Germans raided this 
room

865
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,829
and left with you,no shots were fired.

866
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:30,993
"No shots were fired"?

867
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,714
No gunshots,no machine-gun fire.

868
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,830
How would you know?You weren't there.

869
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:40,909
I was there.

870
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,875
What?

871
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,358
No,you weren't!You were sick.

872
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,551
- Your wife called.
- From the bistro.

873
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:01,719
That's all true.
But that afternoon.

874
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,913
I felt better,and since my wife was 
running errands...

875
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:09,157
That's interesting. No one saw you.

876
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,437
Naturally.

877
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,148
The Gestapo showed up seconds after I 
did.

878
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,717
I hid in the rhododendrons. I witnessed 
everything.

879
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,229
I was scared stiff!

880
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,398
Why didn't you tell us that earlier?

881
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:28,750
So you wouldn't suspect me,

882
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,033
given the circumstances surrounding my 
arrival.

883
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:39,799
Why do you feel the need to open up now?

884
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:43,114
Some things you can't keep to yourself.

885
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,399
Castille may be dead,but I can't let 
him down.

886
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:51,593
Don't you believe me?

887
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,194
How can we?

888
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,637
You swore you weren't there,and now...

889
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,592
My word isn't good enough?

890
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,919
The first one or the second?

891
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:05,354
Do you have proof?

892
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,833
"Proof"...

893
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,869
That night,you didn't come by bike,as 
usual.

894
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:19,956
Yes.

895
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,116
No. You came by tandern.

896
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,995
It was next to the front door.

897
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,637
True.
I borrowed it from my brother-in-law.

898
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:34,636
See?

899
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,868
But how did Castille die?Try to focus!

900
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:44,154
I don't know what Blanchet is trying to 
prove,
but I maintain what I said.

901
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,791
Castille fired, the Germans fired back,
and Castille went down.

902
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,430
Under a hail of machine-gun fire?

903
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,635
That's right.

904
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,360
No. Shots rang out before the Germans 
stormed in.

905
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:07,597
They were shooting at you while you 
scattered.

906
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,793
But when they went in there,there was 
total silence.

907
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,070
Total!

908
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,829
But...

909
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:37,396
Machine-gun fire causes damage.

910
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,876
Did you see any bullet holes?

911
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,355
None.

912
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,038
It must've been a replica machine gun.

913
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,271
A toy machine gun.

914
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,118
Say something.

915
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,839
Now I'm not so sure...

916
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,674
It happened so long ago!
Try to remember.

917
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,510
Let's see...

918
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,189
I was right there.

919
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,869
Castille...

920
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,873
Let me think.

921
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,758
You have nightmares,you wake up,you 
can't remember them.

922
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:29,393
It's the same thing.

923
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,439
So Castille...

924
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,869
The desk...

925
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,388
Yes...

926
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,030
Yes,now I remember.

927
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,958
You were right,there was no machine-gun 
fire.

928
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:58,711
Men armed with machine guns came in 
here,but fired no shots.

929
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,239
I made a mistake.

930
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:04,628
Two plainclothes policemen with 
handguns...

931
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,195
...came in through that door.

932
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:11,555
One of them shot Castille in the back.

933
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:12,750
There you have it.

934
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,790
It's strange that I thought I heard 
machine-gun fire...

935
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:21,632
We make up stuff we think is true.

936
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,675
- Through that very door.
- No one came in...

937
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,031
...through that door,sir.
- How would you know?

938
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:30,468
I was behind it.

939
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,430
"Behind it"?

940
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,232
Yes,behind the door.

941
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:37,911
When the Germans were spotted,he fetch 
me in the kitchen.

942
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,269
You wouldn't budge.

943
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,598
On account of my rheumatism. They 
wanted to hide in the tank.

944
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,233
A woman my age!

945
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,712
So my cat and I stayed put.
Poor little creature. I kept caressing 
it.

946
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:54,357
I heard shots in the grounds.

947
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,515
"In the grounds."

948
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:58,951
I headed here to see what was going on.

949
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:03,915
From behind the door,I heard quite a 
commolition...

950
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,032
I just stood there while my cat purred.

951
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,836
But then I got scared and I headed to 
the tank too.

952
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,554
Were any shots fired in the room?

953
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,719
No,but I heard the stomping of feet.

954
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:22,276
And shouting. In Germans. They made 
quite a racket!

955
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,153
What do you say to that?

956
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,353
I don't know...

957
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:36,037
But I witnessed Castille's death.

958
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:40,438
I wasn't taking notes,so whether they 
came in through...

959
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,235
He's right. We'll come back to that.

960
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,592
Focus on the order of events. First,the 
thief.

961
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,472
We forgot about him.

962
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,999
When we unmask him...

963
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,633
And he's among us.

964
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,634
You were broke back in '44.

965
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,114
I was working.

966
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,469
For a pittance.

967
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:04,071
I had regular employment!

968
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,397
You tried scrounging off me a few times 
to no avail.

969
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:17,450
You'd need to get up pretty early!

970
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,749
I lent you money several times. Small 
sums,but...

971
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,075
We'll get to the bottom of this.

972
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:14,917
So...

973
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,113
Let me,I'm used to it.
Fiscal inquisition...

974
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,709
When did you buy your printing house?

975
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:22,875
1946.

976
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,837
It's quite a sizable one.

977
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:26,677
Yes.

978
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,871
How much'd you pay for it?

979
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,354
None of your business.

980
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,078
Any partners?

981
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,429
No.

982
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,352
You bought it cash?

983
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,595
None of your business!

984
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,156
It is!You don't become an owner 
overnight.

985
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:45,353
And don't say you won the lottery.

986
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,869
Where'd you find the money?

987
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,354
- I don't have to tell you!
You know very well I'm innocent.

988
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:53,709
Then why not answer?

989
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,399
But what...?

990
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,630
Well?

991
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,274
Where'd you get the money?

992
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,118
A friend lent it to me.

993
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,833
A friend "lent" you money?

994
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,077
Sometimes friends do lend money to 
their friends.

995
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,429
What friends?

996
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:15,717
You didn't know him.

997
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,478
Did you commit it to paper?

998
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,352
Not between friends!

999
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:24,395
And where can we question this model 
friend?
- Where does he live?

1000
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:26,591
At the cemetary,he's dead.

1001
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,793
Before getting reimbursed!You think 
we're idiots?

1002
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,071
I'm an honest man.

1003
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,270
I'm an honest man!

1004
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,919
If you were us,Rougier,

1005
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:58,432
you'd find your answer suspicious too.

1006
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:02,189
In 1943,you were in dire straits.

1007
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,428
In 1946,you bought a printing house 
worth millions,

1008
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:11,030
and when asked where you got the money,
you conjure up the ghost of an 
anonymous creditor.

1009
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,277
But why suspect me instead of...

1010
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,471
...Vandamme or Bernadi?

1011
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:24,117
Is it our fault if you gave two 
versions of Castille's death?

1012
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:29,633
And if those versions contradict 
Blanchet and Victorine's?

1013
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,831
My word is just as good as theirs!

1014
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:35,516
Blanchet retracted himself too,but no 
one suspects him.

1015
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,669
Yet he got here just a few seconds 
before the Gestapo.
- "This way,please"!

1016
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,756
What?

1017
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,234
Bastard!

1018
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,672
Let's not get worked up.

1019
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,390
Blanchet,
didn't you say there were no gunshots

1020
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:57,512
between the time the Germans entered 
the house

1021
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,314
and they left with Rougier?

1022
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,475
Yes.

1023
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:05,111
- You stand by that?
- Absolutely.

1024
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,912
It's quite simple,then.

1025
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,638
If the Germans didn't murder Castille

1026
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:16,831
then he was murdered before their 
arrival.

1027
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,752
A few seconds before.

1028
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:26,513
During the short time he was alone with 
someone.

1029
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:32,553
What are you implying?

1030
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:33,715
Admit it.

1031
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:39,431
Admit that you'd figured it out.
You stole the money.

1032
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:44,236
You'd been found out.
Castille was going to unmask you.

1033
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:45,634
But then,a miracle.

1034
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:46,556
You're mad!

1035
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,909
The Gestapo arrived.

1036
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,714
- Call that a "miracle"?
The arrival of the Gestapo?

1037
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:53,957
You could pin the murder on them.

1038
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,989
You heard him,he called me a murderer!

1039
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,199
Let it go!

1040
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:14,237
He's got no proof,no witness!

1041
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:18,911
Thibaud...
I came back with a bullet in my 
shoulder.

1042
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,671
Tell them what state I was in
when I told you Castille was dead.

1043
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,189
Did I look like a murderer?

1044
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,709
Did I look like a murderer?

1045
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,236
Say something,Le Gueven!

1046
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:38,991
I'm the one who gave the alert the 
night of the meeting!

1047
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,556
You escaped thanks to me!

1048
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,638
If you're all alive today...

1049
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,398
OK,since I've got no choice...

1050
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:06,113
Tell them,Marie-Octobre.

1051
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,157
Tell them they're wrong.

1052
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,518
- How can I...?
- Tell them the truth.

1053
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,199
What "truth"?

1054
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:18,548
Brace yourself and tell them.

1055
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:24,270
Tell them... what kind of man Castille 
was.

1056
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,034
I don't understand.

1057
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:33,998
Marie-Octobre...

1058
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,192
I'm defending my honor,maybe even my 
life!

1059
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,149
Remember...

1060
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:47,389
...when you'd bring your sketches to 
the printing house.

1061
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:48,749
Every Tuesday. Remember?

1062
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,198
Yes,so?

1063
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,470
We hit it off right away,no?

1064
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,079
Yes.

1065
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:02,156
I lived alone. I was withdrawn,

1066
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:06,478
yet you found a way to...

1067
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,875
We'd chat away confide in each other.

1068
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,958
Then one day I invited you to lunch.

1069
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,037
Just a modest lunch.

1070
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:19,279
Then I started thinking about you.

1071
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,117
And waiting for Tuesday.

1072
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,909
"Marie-Octobre" had become a habit.

1073
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,514
You called me "Little Messenger Boy."

1074
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,510
"Little Messenger Boy"...

1075
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:38,229
Go on.

1076
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:39,989
Continue.

1077
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:44,550
Then you resigned.

1078
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:48,116
You didn't want to work for your 
magazine anymore.

1079
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,072
With good reason!

1080
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,271
I wouldn't see you anymore.

1081
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,438
No more Tuesdays for me.
So I asked you to marry me.

1082
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,389
You knew it was impossible.

1083
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:09,633
"Lack of money."

1084
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:13,315
But that wasn't the real reason.

1085
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:16,591
The real reason was that...

1086
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,109
...you were in love with someone 
else,right?

1087
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,635
Tell them.

1088
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:25,555
Fine...

1089
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:32,071
Marie-Octobre was in love with Castille.

1090
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,235
Impossible!

1091
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,634
Marie-Octobre?

1092
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,876
I realized it right away.

1093
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,638
As soon as she had me join the network.

1094
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,319
That's news to me!

1095
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,557
Women are amazing. Castille?

1096
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,799
It's true.

1097
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,798
I was in love with Castille.

1098
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,232
It was love at first sight.

1099
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,038
I was his mistress.

1100
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,516
I never replaced him.

1101
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:16,234
I'd never have guessed!Life is full of 
surprises!

1102
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,118
Castille knew how to keep a secret!

1103
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:19,639
All this is irrelevant.

1104
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,831
On the contrary.

1105
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:29,398
Your turn now.

1106
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,517
You can't keep this quiet any longer.

1107
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,031
What do you want me to tell them?

1108
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,235
Tell them who Castille was.

1109
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,471
A remarkable man.

1110
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,716
A great leader,yes,we already know that.

1111
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,070
The embodiment of courage and 
selflessness.

1112
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,475
But he was something else too!

1113
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:56,038
He had faults,like all men.

1114
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:02,034
In his private life,he was a selfish 
brute.
- Cynical,capricious.

1115
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,229
You're lying.

1116
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,911
He's lying,don't listen to him.

1117
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,714
How dare you speak of him that way?

1118
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,515
Who are we to judge his private life?
I'm telling the truth!

1119
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:19,874
I'm defending my hide!
Castille despised women.

1120
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,914
How would you know?He never confided in 
you!

1121
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,633
No,but you did.

1122
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,234
You'd come to me when he made you 
miserable.

1123
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,354
How many times did I see you cry?

1124
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:39,079
It was one humilation after another.
"Humilation"?

1125
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:45,078
We quarreled sometimes,of course,but...

1126
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,594
The morning of that meeting that went 
awry...

1127
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,756
Didn't you pay me a visit?

1128
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:53,479
You were panic-stricken!

1129
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,958
You spoke of suicide

1130
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:02,192
You'd found out he had another lover,
that he wanted to marry her.

1131
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:08,508
You wanted to have one last...
... discussion with him.

1132
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,712
And I did,on that very afternoon.

1133
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,593
He asked me to forgive him.
- He promised me...

1134
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,392
He promised you nothing.

1135
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:22,636
You have to tell them exactly what 
happened,
after the alert,

1136
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,079
when Castille ordered us to flee.

1137
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,113
But... I refused.

1138
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:32,596
I didn't want to leave him.

1139
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:40,593
So you stayed alone with him?

1140
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,435
Yes,I lied earlier. I wanted to avoid 
this.

1141
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:55,156
Truth is,I left right behind you.

1142
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,990
You were alone with Castille.

1143
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,633
He was putting away papers in his 
briefcase.

1144
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:09,912
Then I remembered the documents in the 
desk.

1145
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:12,634
I came back here,in this room.

1146
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:15,315
And then...

1147
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,830
No!That's not how it happened!

1148
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,439
And then...

1149
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,391
Castille was dead.

1150
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:34,593
There was a gun beside her,on the 
pedestal table.

1151
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:45,352
Forgive me,Marie-Octobre.

1152
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,189
An awkward silence?

1153
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:07,633
There's orange squash for the thirsty,
and whisky for the drunks.

1154
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,038
Look me in the eye.

1155
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,070
You stand by what you said?

1156
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:40,271
It's the truth.

1157
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:42,118
Your word of honor?

1158
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,111
Do you swear to it?

1159
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,435
I do.

1160
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:55,032
I must be the traitor,then!

1161
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,237
Me,who summoned you here today.

1162
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,351
It's absurd!

1163
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:02,796
Why?

1164
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,719
Why would I have taken such an 
initiative?

1165
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,071
A long-forgotten affair that happened 
15 years ago!

1166
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:12,113
Out of recklessness?Out of defiance?

1167
01:13:13,480 --> 01:13:14,595
When you put it that way...

1168
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:17,633
Murderers don't investigate their own 
crimes!

1169
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,958
Excuse me,but aren't you mistaken about 
something?

1170
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:23,869
"Mistaken"?

1171
01:13:24,920 --> 01:13:28,754
Was this meeting really your idea?

1172
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,313
You said so yourself.

1173
01:13:30,520 --> 01:13:33,080
Oui. Enfin, je vous I'ai dit.

1174
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,751
- Yes,but I meant...
Actually,wasn't this my idea?

1175
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:43,036
When that German 
buyer,Muller,recognized you,I was there.

1176
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,277
Yes,you arrived at that very moment.

1177
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,631
You were so pale,I thought you'd faint.

1178
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,960
You asked Muller to repeat what he'd 
said before leaving us.

1179
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:57,071
Then I told you,

1180
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:01,432
"We owe it to Castille's memory to find 
this traitor."

1181
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,870
What did you answer?

1182
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:08,073
That it'd be impossible to find the 
members of our network,

1183
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:10,510
that it was too late.

1184
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:16,032
My secretary found everyone's address 
easily enough.

1185
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,959
At which point I insisted we call this 
meeting,right?

1186
01:14:20,680 --> 01:14:21,635
Yes

1187
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,715
Afterward.

1188
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:33,393
I've seen you every day these last 15 
years.

1189
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:39,117
And after all this time,I still don't 
understand you.

1190
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,953
Nor have I ever heard about this great 
love for Castille,

1191
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:49,511
this love that explains so many things.

1192
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,512
Since we're stirring up old memories,

1193
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:58,671
I'll ask you just one question.

1194
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:02,159
I know you'll answer truthfully.

1195
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:04,629
Marie,

1196
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,828
did you kill Castille because he was 
going to leave you?

1197
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,036
I love Castille more than life itself.

1198
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:19,391
And he loved me,he wasn't going to 
leave me.

1199
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:22,358
Did you kill him?

1200
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:25,915
No.

1201
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,793
I believe you.

1202
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:41,230
We do too,Marie-Octobre.

1203
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,119
We believe you.

1204
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,638
Friends,I don't know what happened 15 
years ago,

1205
01:15:48,840 --> 01:15:51,912
but I can't take all these accusations 
seriously.

1206
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:55,237
We're playing a dangerous game,it's 
beneath us.

1207
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:58,955
It's a losing game... Let's tread 
carefully.

1208
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,912
Well,my mind's made up.
That's right.

1209
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,796
I've been watching you,listening to you,

1210
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,994
and here's my conclusion:
We're all amazing,but we're acting like 
idiots.

1211
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,078
We're all accusing each other of the 
worst crimes.

1212
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:34,319
We want a culprit,but how absurd is 
that?

1213
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:38,516
I don't like big speeches,but...

1214
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:42,395
...we were all part of a great 
adventure,right?

1215
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:47,071
We liked beautiful women,fancy 
dinners,the easy life.

1216
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:50,192
Yet we threw ourselves into a crazy 
ventures.

1217
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:54,154
We became terrorists,forgers,saboteurs..

1218
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:58,194
We learned how to use transmitters,
parachutes,plastic explosives...

1219
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,118
And for what?

1220
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:05,635
For nothing!For honor.
And honor doesn't pay.

1221
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:08,877
Honestly!Have you all forgotten?

1222
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,828
And Marie-Octobre?

1223
01:17:13,240 --> 01:17:16,949
Remember your escape on Des Saussales 
St.?

1224
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,230
And you,the printer?

1225
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:27,909
We were glad to go to him for false 
papers,and the test...

1226
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:33,319
As for you,Simoneau,
If I voted for you earlier,I was wrong

1227
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:35,511
and I apologize.

1228
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:40,559
You took great risks,we all did!

1229
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:42,349
So...

1230
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:45,117
let's lay off each other.

1231
01:17:46,440 --> 01:17:49,034
There are no traitors here.

1232
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:54,955
Life wasn't a picnic for me either.

1233
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,390
I know,you had lots of guts,

1234
01:17:57,600 --> 01:17:59,158
- Didn't I?
- Lots.

1235
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,037
When you'd hide on Chardon-Lagache St.,

1236
01:18:03,240 --> 01:18:07,028
and I'd bring Mr. Marinval's supplies 
to you...

1237
01:18:07,240 --> 01:18:10,437
And I'd bribe the inspector. What cheek!

1238
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,713
Sometimes my courage flagged.
Sixth floor and no elevator!

1239
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,911
They'd call you Aramis.

1240
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,793
"Aramis",with that mug?Great cover!

1241
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,310
Luckily you were never 
arrested,Victorine.

1242
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,430
Yes,once.

1243
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:25,959
You never mentioned it.

1244
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,674
'Cause I was at fault.

1245
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,429
I had a roast beef for Mr. Aramis.

1246
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,555
I decided to give it to my 
sister-in-law,
but I came across some policemen on the 
way,in civvies!

1247
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,478
Did they question you?

1248
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:44,470
- Naturally.
I thought they were German officers,but 
on the contrary.

1249
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:45,876
"On the contrary"?

1250
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:50,471
They said they were Resistance fighters 
too.

1251
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:51,317
"Too"?

1252
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,514
I'd intimated that I had contacts with 
the Resistance.
- Which led to...

1253
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:59,154
- You mentioned the network?
- Why wouldn't I?

1254
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:00,634
When did it happen?

1255
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,989
It's simple.

1256
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,317
The roast beef was for my 
sister-in-law's birthday.

1257
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:07,397
Jeanne's birthday is on August 20.

1258
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,910
On August 21,the Gestapo barged in 
here...

1259
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,399
...and killed Castille.

1260
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,230
And we've been racking out brains for a 
decade!

1261
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:23,429
What'd I say?

1262
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:26,518
You betrayed us,you dumbbell.

1263
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:27,948
Never.

1264
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,115
You screwed up big time!

1265
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,949
They were patriots,I say!I'm not that 
stupid!

1266
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:37,278
Just a few minutes until

1267
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,517
the European champions are crowned,

1268
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:43,598
for,as you can see,

1269
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,119
there are still four of them left...

1270
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:46,309
Marinval!

1271
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,990
I know how to hold my tongue!

1272
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:52,668
You don't open up to just anyone!
You would've done the same thing.

1273
01:19:52,880 --> 01:19:56,509
I knew I could trust them.

1274
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:58,995
Why?'Cause they "looked" trustworthy?

1275
01:19:59,200 --> 01:20:00,997
"Why"?

1276
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,469
While we were talking,

1277
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,638
one of their friends came in and said,

1278
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,796
I remember it clearly,

1279
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,629
that the Canadian landing in Normandy 
had failed.

1280
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,990
He'd received a dispatch.

1281
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,954
If you'd seen them!They were all 
shattered.

1282
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:22,116
What a sorry sight!

1283
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,669
That's when they said I could leave.

1284
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:27,519
They were completely distraught!

1285
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:29,039
See?

1286
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:33,039
"Canadian landing"?

1287
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,070
Yes.

1288
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,999
That took place in August '42.

1289
01:20:37,200 --> 01:20:38,713
Yes,August '42.

1290
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:42,913
The Gestapo came here in August '44,two 
years later.

1291
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,030
True enough.

1292
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:46,993
Victorine is therefore exonerated.

1293
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:50,438
See?That's what I was saying.

1294
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,473
Accusing poor old me,with my 
rheumatism...

1295
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,114
Anyone can make a mistake,Victorine.

1296
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,799
So we're back at square one.

1297
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,355
Just great!

1298
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:15,793
For breakfast tommorow,I'd like two 
fried eggs and white wine.

1299
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,273
What time is it,anyway?

1300
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:24,312
Excuse me,but I have to drop by the 
hospital.

1301
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:28,752
Victorine,be nice and get my overcoat.

1302
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,949
But,Thibaud...

1303
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,831
It's late,old man.

1304
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:35,235
I gotta be at the office by 8 tomorrow.

1305
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,034
Once a pencil pusher...!

1306
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:39,559
Please,Vandamme!

1307
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,719
Sorry,Marie,but my paper comes off the 
press at 7...

1308
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,115
- Gimme a lift?
- Sure,it's on the way.

1309
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:49,788
Wait,don't leave just yet.

1310
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,831
Gimme five more minutes.

1311
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,356
We can settle this in five minutes.

1312
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:59,429
I doubt it,but I wouldn't want Marinval
to accuse me of putting a wrench in the 
works...

1313
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:06,639
I wish we could've settle this among 
ourselves,

1314
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:12,039
and avoid calling in a third party.

1315
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:14,351
But too bad,you asked for it.

1316
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:19,033
An old enemy will therefore judge us.

1317
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:25,348
Only one man saw the face of the person 
who betrayed us.

1318
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,833
Only one man knows him.

1319
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:31,915
His name is Wilfrid Muller,

1320
01:22:32,120 --> 01:22:35,795
a former Wehrmacht intelligence officer.

1321
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:38,678
Wilfrid Muller is here.

1322
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:41,954
He's waiting upstairs.

1323
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:44,914
Damn!

1324
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:49,551
There's still time to forgo his 
involvement.

1325
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:53,995
No?

1326
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,714
So be it.

1327
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,551
Mr. Muller,please!

1328
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,352
So it was you, bastard!

1329
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,629
Admit it!Admit it!

1330
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,512
No,leave me alone!

1331
01:23:58,720 --> 01:24:02,395
It was a trick,our last resort.

1332
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,553
Fess up!

1333
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,751
How much did you sell us out for?

1334
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:11,236
- It wasn't for the money.
- No,it was for honor!

1335
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:15,797
But you'll talk,I guarantee that!

1336
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:17,155
You piece of shit!

1337
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,034
Why'd you betray us?Why?

1338
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:21,639
For Marie-Octobre.

1339
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:24,070
- What?
- I killed Castille for her.

1340
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:25,190
Out of love,I bet!

1341
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,675
- Yes.
You think we're fools?

1342
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:32,670
And you accused her out of love,too?
- Talk or you're dead!

1343
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:33,835
Stop!

1344
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:43,071
You've got nothing to lose now,so tell 
the truth.

1345
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:46,193
I'll help you,I think I've figured it 
out.

1346
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,073
"Help" him?With a swift kick in the ass!

1347
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,078
You weren't lying about loving 
Marie-Octobre.

1348
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:56,637
But between that love and Castille's 
murder,
there was more than betrayal.

1349
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,354
There was also the theft of three 
million.

1350
01:24:59,800 --> 01:25:03,793
You're not the first idiot to steal for 
love,

1351
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,711
thinking that money will win over a 
woman,
but it doesn't always work. The proof...

1352
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:13,959
Who cares why or how?
There are no extenuating circumstances!

1353
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:17,948
Let's finish off this scum right now!
He's half dead anyway.

1354
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,118
Have some dignity,Rougier. Be a man.

1355
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:30,914
You didn't kill Castille because of 
me,did you?

1356
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,157
He knew I'd stolen money from the 
network.

1357
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:39,509
When I realized he'd accuse me in front 
of you...

1358
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,995
You panicked.

1359
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:44,596
So I went to the others.

1360
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,394
Those Gestapo swine!

1361
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:53,468
So they'd get rid of Castille?
Is that it?

1362
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,718
I'd lost my mind.

1363
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:58,077
It's only when I saw them arrive that 
night,

1364
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,750
machine guns in hand,

1365
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,871
that I realized what I'd done...

1366
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:05,995
So...

1367
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,992
I tried to make amends.

1368
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:10,395
At least...

1369
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:12,633
minimize the damages.

1370
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,318
i gave the alert.

1371
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:19,593
And took advantage of the situation to 
murder Castille?

1372
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,268
You had nothing to lose,you were 
hedging your bets.

1373
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,314
The Germans thought you'd killed a 
terrorist,
and we blamed the Gestapo.

1374
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,397
But they still arrested me!

1375
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:31,478
No,Rougier,they only pretended to.

1376
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,993
And you pretended to escape,right?

1377
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:40,274
Thibaud removed the bullet you shot in 
your own shoulder.

1378
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:43,108
You're a thief,a traitor

1379
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,878
...and a murderer.

1380
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,555
Let me go now.

1381
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:56,958
Step aside.

1382
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,830
Gimme the car keys,Marinval.

1383
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:01,790
But...

1384
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:02,910
Move!

1385
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,789
Step aside.

1386
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:19,189
Farther back!

1387
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,752
Move over,OK?

1388
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,390
No,Rougier,you won't get past me.

1389
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,910
Please don't make me shoot you.

1390
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:43,709
I beg of you.

1391
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:48,869
Stand back,it'll be your fault if I 
shoot her.

1392
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:50,877
No!

1393
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,035
No!

1394
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:11,396
What'll you do with him?

1395
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,079
We all agreed beforehand.

1396
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,113
He'll sign the confession,the reason 
for his sucide.

1397
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:17,230
No.

1398
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:19,351
You have no right!

1399
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,515
You don't...

1400
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:21,710
Start writing.

1401
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,229
- No.
No,I don't want to.

1402
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:26,351
You can't make me.

1403
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:27,515
Start writing.

1404
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:31,788
Go on,Rougier. Your situation is 
hopeless.

1405
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,070
It'll be over in a flash.

1406
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:37,714
"I admit..."

1407
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,515
Go on.

1408
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,270
"I admit that I,in August 1944,

1409
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:52,351

1415

Just one more sentence. You can do it.

"Confounded by my former comrades,

Sign it.

1422
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,195
Sign it!

1423
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:04,192
In the name of what justice do you 
condemn him?

1424
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,118
In the name of our own justice.

1425
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,630
A justice without pardon,leniecy or 
mercy?

1426
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,434
Did he show Castille mercy?
- For your own salvation...

1427
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:13,834
No sermons,please!

1428
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,076
Thibaud,tell them to let me live.

1429
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,477
I'm a bastard,but I promise to make 
amends.

1430
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,638
Get up,I can't do anything to help you.

1431
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:27,995
Blanchet...

1432
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:32,918
You have a wife and kids like me.

1433
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:36,874
What'll happen to them?
- I'm not dog!

1434
01:30:37,080 --> 01:30:38,308
Get away from me!

1435
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,908
Listen to me!

1436
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,756
If you murder this man,

1437
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:46,996
...and it is murder.

1438
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,110
Don't count on me to back up your 
suicide story.

1439
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:54,517
I'll go to the police and testify 
against you.

1440
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:58,751
Murder and accessory to murder. You 
know what that entails.

1441
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,110
You already know that,Simoneau.

1442
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:05,349
We'll accept the consequences.
All of them.

1443
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,913
All of them.
You'll accept them together,but 
individually?

1444
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:13,513
Alone with your conscience,no.

1445
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:15,631
You're not monsters.

1446
01:31:16,640 --> 01:31:20,633
You don't execute a man after 15 
years,it's appaling!

1447
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:25,197
Deep down inside,you know this isn't 
right.

1448
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,789
You know it isn't right,but you're 
afraid to say so.

1449
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,876
Isn't that true,Thibaud?

1450
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,069
Blanchet?

1451
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:35,954
Isn't that true?

1452
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,235
Vandamme?

1453
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:42,351
And you too, Simoneau.

1454
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,513
You know I'm right, just admit it.

1455
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:48,837
You don't like killing Rougier at all!

Can you come right away?

1475
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,797
I just killed a man.
