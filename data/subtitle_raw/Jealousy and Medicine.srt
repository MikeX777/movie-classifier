directed by

14
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,960
Are you that industrialist,
Widmar?

15
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,920
Yes.

16
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,480
What's this?

17
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,760
It's for you.
Anonymous documents.

18
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,200
Wait!

19
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,000
Stop!

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,920
"Of Adultery"

21
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
You poor cuckold,

22
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,160
I send these memories
instead of a will, as a farewell.

23
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,040
Once yours, Sophie D.

24
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,200
These are insults!

25
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,200
It's a libel!

26
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,800
You called, my lord?

27
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,880
I did. Why do you let strangers
into the garden?!

28
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,920
Some rascals are hanging about here!

29
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,600
What rascals?
What strangers?

30
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,800
- I've seen no one, Mr Widmar.
- That's exactly the problem!

31
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,680
How dares she?

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,920
One awful woman!

33
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,080
Yes, fine.

34
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,760
Goodbye.
Bye.

35
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,840
You're leaving?
I changed my mind.

36
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,560
- Was someone here?
- No.

37
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,160
Are you sure?

38
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,440
- I thought I saw a doctor.
- Really?

39
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
What a terrible wind.

40
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,040
It shall make all the patients
leave this world in a week!

41
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,000
No, thank you.

42
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
Of course...

43
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,160
It may even wreck
healthy people lives.

44
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,320
Would you agree, doctor,

45
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,920
that medical ethics is very different
from the regular moral sense?

46
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,640
Different from general moral principles?
I don't think so.

47
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,120
But I do.

48
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,920
Physicians always lie to patients.

49
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,760
That must become a habit
in private life as well.

50
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,840
- What do you mean?
- You don't take sugar?

51
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,560
I beg your pardon.

52
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,600
Excuse me. I have a lot on my mind.
I should go back to work.

53
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,800
That's a pity...
Come visit us again some time.

54
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,560
Thank you.

55
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,760
It was said it was the appendix,
then - women's health problems.

56
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,280
But I've heard it was something
quite different!

57
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:28,240
If that's true
and Widmar knows nothing about it,

58
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,600
that means she cheated on him
when she'd already become his wife.

59
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,840
I counted on fingers.

60
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,160
One day me and Widmar
went to the movie theatre.

61
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,360
They were screening "Love Manoeuvres"
with my favourite Żabczyński.

62
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,560
We were a bit early and adverts
were still on, which Widmar hates!

63
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,800
I know this world,
bright days, golden dreams.

64
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Your smile,
the sparkle in your eyes...

65
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
They keep us in here
like we were a flock of sheep.

66
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,520
Who cares about that?

67
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,880
You're the one, the only one!
Forgive me all my sins!

68
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,120
Prophecies that have never come true!
So many routes and words...

69
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,840
Can I have a chocolate, please?
Can I have a chocolate?

70
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,080
Here you go.

71
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,200
IS YOUR SKIN ALIVE?

72
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
Excuse me.

73
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm sorry.

74
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,080
She must be a swimmer.
Have you seen it?

75
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,520
Her one arm
is lower than the other one.

76
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,840
POLISH NEWSREEL

77
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,240
International Equestrian Contest
at Łazienki Racecourse in Warsaw

78
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,720
brought a great success
to Polish equestrians.

79
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,680
Despite strong rivals,
they won the cup.

80
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,600
- Swimmers have uneven arms?
- I don't know.

81
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,640
She may be a bureaucrat then.

82
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,640
Contestants drank champagne from
the cup to cheer for the winners.

83
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,400
If you don't enjoy it here,
we can leave.

84
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,200
You irritate so easily today.

85
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,720
Also women should take part
in defending the country.

86
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,720
They can join defence training voluntarily.

87
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,280
The title, the estate
- it's nothing.

88
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,320
I've been looking for kindness, grace
and straightforwardness all my life.

89
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,360
And you've got it all.

90
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,640
No, I can't believe it.

91
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,920
A prince falls in love with
a Cinderella only in fairy tale.

92
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,720
Life can be a fairy tale, too.

93
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,760
In real life a prince asks about
the marriage portion, about position.

94
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,760
Only children believe in fairy tales.

95
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:29,640
Let's go back, like in the olden days,
to the fairy tale land.

96
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,360
Turn my life into a wonderful
fairy tale with your love!

97
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,080
What's happened?

98
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,040
Fire!

99
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,640
It's locked!
That way!

100
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,560
Excuse me.
I reckon it's your glove.

101
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,400
Thank you.

102
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,840
Now I know
you don't care about me,

103
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,640
you must know you're leaving me
for no better woman.

104
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,080
- What do you mean?!
- I want you to know.

105
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,120
That lady lived with
every second man in this town.

106
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,320
Everyone knows
everything about her.

107
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,040
Can't you see?
She's cheating on you.

108
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,200
Maybe even the moment we speak?
But you all deserve it!

109
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,400
You think I've been faithful?

110
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,000
Everyone knows
I've made you a cuckold!

111
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,400
Wait!

112
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,280
Very well then.
You'll be sorry.

113
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,600
When I left the hospital,

114
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,120
I wanted to forget those sad events
as soon as possible.

115
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,880
I went dancing with my friends.

116
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,880
I didn't expect
to see Mrs Widmar there.

117
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,240
Please, help me.
Help me.

118
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,680
- What's happened?
- She's fainted.

119
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,840
Excuse me.

120
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,360
It's too soon to dance.
It can cause haemorrhage.

121
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,920
Please.

122
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,200
Excuse me.

123
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,680
He was so disarmingly trustful
and naive,

124
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,600
that I wanted to shout
above people's heads and the tables

125
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,120
and tell him everything I knew
about the hospital and operation.

126
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
- Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning.

127
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,200
- Here are the certificates of death.
- Very well.

128
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,040
- Good morning, doctor.
- Good morning.

129
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,320
Doctor!
Am I really not worse?

130
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,800
Why there is still leakage
from my knee?

131
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,600
That's nothing.
You're not worse.

132
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,560
Everything's going to be just fine.

133
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,920
Good morning!

134
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:18,400
Doctor, a gentleman has been
waiting for you for half an hour.

135
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,360
Excellent.

136
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,000
We might need to amputate
that poor fellow's leg.

137
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,960
Yes?
Excuse me.

138
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,920
Thank you.

139
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,480
You're the gentleman
who's been waiting for me.

140
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes.

141
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,080
Let's move to my office.

142
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,920
Have you come as a patient?

143
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,800
Not exactly.

144
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,120
More as a husband
of one of your patients.

145
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,000
What can I do for you?

146
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,400
Doctor...

147
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,000
I owe my wife's life to you.

148
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,560
I'd like to know
the course of the operation.

149
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,200
The course?
The best possible one.

150
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,720
Was it really the appendix?

151
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Of course.

152
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,920
If we had done the operation a day later,
it would've been too late.

153
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,200
I don't want you
to get me wrong...

154
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,400
I'm sure you remember
I was abroad back then.

155
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,680
When I came back,
it had all been over.

156
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,720
My wife never talked
about the details of her condition.

157
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,920
But you must be aware that
it became clear during the procedure

158
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,880
that your wife had been suffering
from other ailments.

159
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,480
What sort of ailments?

160
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,680
Women's health condition.

161
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,320
Quite common, nothing serious.

162
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,280
I can't understand,
why you're so interested in the past.

163
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,440
There's nothing strange about it.
Are you telling the truth?

164
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,280
I beg your pardon?

165
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,880
You must tell me the truth.
I beg of you.

166
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,280
Like only a man can ask another man
in exceptional situations.

167
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,440
I'm not a man, I'm a doctor.

168
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,640
Excuse me but I should be going.

169
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,560
They're waiting for me
in radiography room.

170
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,840
I can see why you're anxious.

171
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,720
However I assure you
your wife is perfectly healthy now.

172
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,640
Let bygones be bygones.

173
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning, doctor.

174
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,280
- What's new?
- Another one from the crash.

175
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:37,160
Those cars are like a plague!
It's worse than tuberculosis!

176
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,400
Dear Willi, I owe you a letter.

177
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,240
But today I particularly feel like
sharing my problems with you.

178
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:19,400
That patient's husband
came to see me today.

179
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,080
The one we'd operated on when you'd
visited me during your vacation.

180
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,200
You're familiar
with the story of that operation

181
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,120
and its significance in my life.

182
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,680
Although you still
don't appreciate it, I'm afraid.

183
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,320
Willi!

184
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,200
Willi, my dear!

185
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,600
- I'm so happy!
- Me too!

186
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,280
- How was your trip?
- Very good. However...!

187
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,640
I'll speak Polish in Poland.
Shall I?

188
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,680
- You look pale.
- Oh, no.

189
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,520
You seem tired though.

190
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,920
You're right.
I skipped vacation this year.

191
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,880
- A telephone call for you.
- For me?

192
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,120
You should've said I'm not here.

193
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,920
Doctor Otherone speaking.

194
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,080
What a horrible voice.
She must be an old witch.

195
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,920
I'm very sorry but I can't come now.
My assistant will see you.

196
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,040
Fine.

197
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,800
I'll be right there.

198
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,320
Such a strange voice.

199
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,560
She should be young, attractive,
naked... and in bed.

200
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,920
- You said it was an old witch.
- That's a possibility.

201
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,040
I should go.
She's in pain.

202
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,640
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No. Wait for me in here.

203
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,400
- Shall we dance?
- Sorry?

204
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,320
Why didn't doctor Otherone
come to see me?

205
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,600
I'm him.

206
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,160
I see...

207
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,480
What's wrong?
I'm in pain.

208
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,040
- Where does it hurt?
- Here.

209
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,440
Lift your nightgown, please.

210
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,840
- Is that painful?
- Very.

211
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,240
You've got a fever.
How high?

212
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,200
38,5°C.

213
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,520
It's nothing serious.
It's the appendix.

214
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,760
You can't be operated on now.
We must wait for the attack to pass.

215
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,680
No food,
just a few sips of bitter tea.

216
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,320
Operation?

217
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,240
The procedure is as easy
as childish games.

218
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,440
I'm all alone in the house.
I'm very scared.

219
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,040
My husband left abroad.

220
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,000
I'd like you to take me
to your hospital.

221
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,880
It won't be necessary.

222
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,560
Stay in bed for a few days
and then we'll see.

223
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,360
I'll come back tomorrow.

224
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,600
Doctor!

225
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,320
Goodnight.

226
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,080
At that moment her face changed
beyond recognition.

227
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,000
I felt she was the most beautiful
woman I'd ever seen in my life.

228
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,680
But the weirdest thing of all
was that I'd never cared

229
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,520
whether my patient
was pretty or not before.

230
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,760
That's right, my friend.

231
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,920
The position of a woman
in our time is so strong

232
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,520
that it's dangerous and sick.

233
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,640
Women are good for nothing
but for making love to.

234
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,800
At least for me.

235
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,160
Is that your opinion?

236
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,680
A man will never believe a woman
is doing whatever she wants with him.

237
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,640
If only it was something good!

238
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,520
I've met many scientists
and artists

239
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,720
who gave up half their ambitions
influenced by their wives.

240
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,920
All the same,
it's both meaningful and sad

241
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:19,840
that men are the only ones
who disagree with me.

242
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,040
Women mostly admit I'm right
in their minds.

243
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,920
Well...

244
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,640
Can you remember our conversation
about that woman, Willi?

245
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,800
I'm starting to feel that Rebecca
is my doom.

246
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,760
I can always see her image
in my mind's eye.

247
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,480
I see her face everywhere.

248
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,480
I see the unique line of her stomach
which I mentioned to you.

249
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,840
The next day was calm.

250
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,360
Caregiver Paweł
was running errands for your wife.

251
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,040
He even got two bouquets of flowers
your wife asked him to buy

252
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,680
to cover the smell of gasoline
that annoyed her.

253
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,440
Of course
it was some kind of a delusion.

254
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,960
I couldn't smell gasoline.

255
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,920
The nurses had already fallen out
with the missus.

256
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,200
- They weren't too fond of her.
- As usual.

257
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
I worked night shift that day.

258
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:16,880
I was in the office,
studying before my pathology exam...

259
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,400
Open the window.

260
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,720
Cold compress.

261
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,760
Hello?

262
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,240
It's Rubiński, doctor.

263
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,840
Who?
I don't understand.

264
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,440
- Number 101.
- 101?

265
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,880
Mrs Widmar.
Get her to the operating theatre.

266
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,320
Surgical instruments?

267
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,480
You'll be fine.
These are for some other procedure.

268
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,720
I'm scared.
Doctor!

269
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,800
Don't be.

270
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,360
I'm going to shave you.

271
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,600
Start with the anaesthetic.

272
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,360
Breathe in calmly.
Easy.

273
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,440
She's fallen asleep, doctor.

274
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,840
What time is it?
Do remember that.

275
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,680
It's 02:16, doctor.

276
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,640
Lancet.

277
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,920
The first cut always
soothes the surgeon's nerves.

278
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:03,040
It looked like a pleasant job.
It was like artistic inspiration.

279
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,920
It didn't occur to me
something wrong might happen.

280
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,680
For the first 8 minutes, every stage
of the operation was successful.

281
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,520
- What's the time?
- 8 minutes, doctor.

282
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,360
Oh, la-la!
Look at this...

283
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,400
It's the third time.

284
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,840
Encapsulated.

285
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,240
Yes, sir.

286
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,080
Scissors.

287
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,000
Fool!

288
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,520
I need the patient to breathe easily.

289
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Scissors!

290
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,000
Fool!

291
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,280
The patient must breathe!

292
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,640
Ether.

293
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,040
We have none.

294
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,000
Get the sterilized instruments.
Scissors.

295
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,760
Get her tongue out.

296
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,160
Fool!

297
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,720
Yes, sir.

298
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,000
The tongue.

299
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,000
Forceps.

300
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,240
Forceps!

301
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,640
Forceps!

302
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,640
Endoscope.

303
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,440
And don't jump around!
Get the grip!

304
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,640
His shouting really made us
get a grip.

305
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,200
I made no more mistakes
passing him the instruments.

306
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,400
I was trying to see something in
the abdominal cavity, but I couldn't.

307
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,160
Of course I understood
there was some kind of complication.

308
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,840
That it's no longer the appendix,

309
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,320
that we're operating on genitals
but I didn't know why.

310
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,120
You found out afterwards though.

311
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,760
The director said it was a cyst
but if it really was - I'm not sure.

312
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:30,920
Have you got any assumptions?
Any suspicions?

313
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,360
Try to remember a detail,
which you could use as a hint.

314
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
Truly...

315
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,200
I remember nothing.

316
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,840
It happened so quickly that
I don't even know, how it all ended.

317
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,520
It's dawning. We must've been
operating for two hours.

318
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,040
When you're doing trepanation,
you need your brain.

319
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,840
When you're operating on a woman,
you need to think about genitals.

320
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:52,720
- Boruch, dad is crying again.
- Dad has got a smoky chimney.

321
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,040
- You're lying!
- No, you are!

322
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,640
Where have you got so dirty again?

323
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,920
The sweep threw me into the chimney!

324
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
You crazy girl!

325
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,440
Anielka, Boruch!
Get back home.

326
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,160
Dad, he hit me.

327
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:18,760
My Boruch...
Why did you hit her?

328
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,840
I'm going to make you suffer for it.

329
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,280
She bit my leg!

330
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,840
I'm not sure about that anyway.

331
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,320
Maybe it's just my imagination.

332
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,920
Gold, what are you talking about?
I can't understand a thing.

333
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,120
I don't want to offend you.

334
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,080
What if those are just presumptions
of an old, blind tailor?

335
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
Hello?

336
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,480
Yes, it's me.

337
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,560
You can go now.
And remember about the lining.

338
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:06,240
Dear God, why did you punish me
with such children?

339
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,840
I see...

340
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,440
- Get back into the house now!
- I'm not coming!

341
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,080
Do you recognize me?

342
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,440
Tell your father I'm waiting for him
today afternoon at my house.

343
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,640
No, tell him I'll be in Esplanada
at 6 p.m.

344
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,120
- It's that café.
- I know.

345
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,480
- Don't forget though.
- I forget nothing.

346
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,920
Listen to me, Gold...

347
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,920
I think it's all
a disgusting joke of yours.

348
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,800
Don't even say that, Mr Widmar.
No.

349
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,720
Why did you grow old so soon, Gold?
Look at me - I wear well.

350
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,880
Admittedly, I'm only 50.
What about you?

351
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,440
Me?
I'm 38.

352
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,920
- What?
- 38.

353
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,760
Let's go back to our business.

354
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,440
What will it be?
Do you agree?

355
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,200
I do agree but I can't do it.

356
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,120
Listen to me, Gold.
You've always been sewing for me.

357
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,920
That's true.

358
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,320
We've known each other
for 10 years.

359
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,680
But I still don't know,
if you have a wife.

360
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,200
Perhaps you don't know
what suffering is?

361
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,760
No!

362
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,320
There is no suffering.
All I want is the truth.

363
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,200
The truth.
Can't you see?

364
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,480
No suffering, Mr Widmar.

365
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,720
Gold! I think you're simply
blackmailing me.

366
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,560
Mr Widmar, don't get me scared.

367
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,000
Waiter!

368
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,520
Why are you looking at me like that?

369
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,600
Why are you covered with plumage?
Do you sleep in your coat or what?

370
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,400
Perhaps you sneak
and visit some ladies as well?

371
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,960
Get under their duvets?!

372
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,480
My dear Mr Widmar,
don't get upset.

373
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,560
Calm down, please.

374
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:59,560
Well?
What do you say?

375
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:04,800
Mr Widmar, I can't do it.
I cannot agree.

376
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,920
If you were sure, you could...

377
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,920
- What?
- You could do something foolish.

378
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,240
- How can I help you, sir?
- What's that smell?

379
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,400
It stinks of agony in here.

380
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,680
I can't smell it, sir.

381
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,680
Mr Gold, you've got kids.
You need money.

382
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,920
If you have it,
you can make your son an engineer.

383
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,320
Well?

384
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,440
I'll give you an answer tomorrow.

385
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,680
- What are you doing here?
- Greetings, doctor.

386
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,160
- Are your lungs better?
- Thank you.

387
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,840
You keep on bravely.

388
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,240
Anielka, Boruch!

389
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,120
You should stay in the house
when wind is blowing so strongly.

390
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,960
It could make your lungs burst.

391
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,440
And then all of your blood
would get out through your mouth.

392
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,440
It's easy to get a cold.

393
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,800
And only bastards know
how to get better.

394
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,480
Has your uncle come back
from the power station?

395
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,520
- No.
- Yes!

396
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,400
The question is,
which one of you is lying?

397
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,560
I never know!

398
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:02,520
Dad, why are you so slim?
Are you a little boy?

399
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,640
I'm surely not a little boy!
I'm just slim.

400
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,680
I know!
You're humpbacked then.

401
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,280
I'm not humpbacked.
I'm simply slim.

402
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,280
You must be a dachshund then.

403
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,040
Boruch, please,
you leave me alone!

404
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,520
- Good evening.
- Is it?

405
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,360
What's the matter?

406
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,720
- What should be the matter?
- Nothing is the matter.

407
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,240
But it doesn't justify saying
"good evening".

408
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,520
Come in.
I'm glad you're here.

409
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,280
Boruch, wash Anielka's hands.
Get ready for the supper.

410
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,000
I'll burn you
with boiling water today!

411
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,560
You'll see!
I'll tell daddy!

412
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,880
Look!
The dachshund.

413
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,520
Boruch!

414
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,440
Good heavens!
You're a rascal, not a Boruch!

415
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,200
Trust me, it's all the same.

416
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,080
Everyone wants to earn money,
when one can.

417
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,560
Say yes, otherwise you'll starve
together with your children.

418
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:38,000
I won't be able to help you,
if I get sacked from the station.

419
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,920
Yes...
I see.

420
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,560
I'm off then.

421
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,320
Would you like to become an engineer,
Boruch?

422
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:55,800
- What's 7x8?
- 9.

423
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,840
You'd be one poor engineer.

424
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,560
Isaac!

425
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,360
Isaac!

426
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,320
- Come back, Isaac.
- What's wrong?

427
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,360
- Nothing's wrong.
- Come back.

428
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,920
Isaac, I was thinking...

429
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:19,280
You're ginger.

430
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,080
What of it?

431
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:24,400
Boruch looks just like you.

432
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,400
Abraham,
I hereby give you my word.

433
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:34,240
I never fancied your wife.

434
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,560
I didn't even lay my eyes
on your late wife.

435
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:43,520
Forgive me, Isaac,
but neither her nor I were ginger.

436
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,280
Excuse me.

437
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,240
I'll go now.

438
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,080
I'm going to shoot you...

439
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,440
- Is the missus asleep?
- The missus?

440
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,520
She's gone to the hairdresser's.

441
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,840
I'd like to see that hairdresser.
She didn't mind the weather?

442
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,800
It's not raining.

443
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,760
It's just the wind.

444
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,600
Yes...

445
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,120
You're right.

446
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,840
Left!

447
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,680
Higher!

448
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,920
That's fine.

449
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,280
Good morning, dear sir.

450
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,280
The thing I feared the most
has happened.

451
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,840
It's you.
What happened?

452
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,360
The director of the hospital informed
me today my contract is off.

453
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,880
- His motivation was stupid.
- I'm sorry.

454
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,760
Did you manage
to go through the archives?

455
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:12,920
There's nothing there.

456
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,520
It only says there had been
a cyst which was removed.

457
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:17,760
Bloody hell.

458
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,640
- I think I know what it was.
- Well?

459
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,200
I've come to a conclusion
it must've been eccyesis.

460
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,360
What's that?

461
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,480
Ectopic pregnancy.

462
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,280
Right. 9 weeks...
Everything's clear.

463
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:41,840
- Pardon?
- It's nothing.

464
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,120
Do you swear that's true?

465
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,040
No, I told you
it was just my presumptions.

466
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:54,600
We should leave. It's not
a good place for a conversation.

467
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,640
No, that's too much!

468
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,120
Some details are symptomatic.

469
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,960
For example her complaining about the
smell of gasoline that wasn't there.

470
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,200
Typical compulsions during pregnancy.

471
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,720
- Doctor!
- The weather is awful!

472
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,760
I have been witness
to 12 haemorrhages today!

473
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,440
I'm answering
to another call right now!

474
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,840
Dear Lord!

475
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,920
Have you seen that?
I almost got run over!

476
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,800
It was BMW 327.
6-cylinder motor!

477
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,600
2 carburettors,
overhead-valve engine!

478
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,440
True devil!

479
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,160
- It's time for me to go, too.
- Just a second.

480
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,880
What are the possible complications
of such an operation?

481
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,320
Complications?
Sometimes it's infertility,

482
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,680
psychological trauma

483
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,920
- especially relating to sex life,
susceptibility to putting on weight.

484
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,200
- I see.
- Goodbye.

485
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,120
Boruch, wait!

486
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,360
Wait for me!

487
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:39,080
Boruch, get down!
You're a rascal, not a Boruch!

488
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,240
What are you doing?
You're peeping at me, you bastard!

489
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,240
I'm not a bastard but a postman.

490
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,920
- Where are your letters, Mr postman?
- That's it!

491
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:03,560
Don't tell anyone you saw me here,
will you?

492
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,840
HAIRDRESSER'S

493
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,080
What are you doing?!

494
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,480
Nothing. I just wanted
to give her a teddy bear.

495
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,400
Get stuffed with that bear!

496
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,680
Philanthropist!
Wandering and scaring children!

497
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,920
- I just...
- So many perverts walk the earth!

498
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,520
That lady...

499
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,680
That lady in the window
threw some sweets for me.

500
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,680
What lady?
Which window?

501
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,680
On the second floor.

502
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,920
Listen to me, children.
Listen carefully.

503
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,400
How did she look like?

504
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,840
Boruch, you must have seen her.

505
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:27,480
- Did she have long red hair?
- No. She was blonde.

506
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,880
She had pink sacks in the front.

507
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:37,600
Is that your tailor again?
He's a repulsive old man.

508
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,680
- Why repulsive?
- I don't know.

509
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,200
He smells like he was going
to die in a minute.

510
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:46,800
Or like he was already dead.

511
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:55,360
Like I was dead?!

512
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,800
Greetings, sir.

513
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,280
It's you.

514
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,240
Is there something
you'd like to tell me?

515
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:12,720
- Mr Widmar, I made my decision.
- Bravo!

516
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,680
- Do you agree to do both?
- Yes.

517
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:19,360
Splendid!

518
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,240
- Have you hired a thug?
- I did.

519
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,920
- Who's he?
- My brother.

520
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,440
- Your brother?
- Yes.

521
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,440
- And a twin, too, huh?
- No, it's my older brother.

522
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:37,720
I mean he's younger but he looks like
he's older because he's well-build.

523
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:40,400
He works at the power station.

524
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,000
- Power station?
- Yes.

525
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,920
Hold on a second...

526
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,280
- Is he ginger?
- How did you know?

527
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,440
See?
I know everything I should.

528
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,920
- How much does he want?
- It's up to you.

529
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,240
Will that be enough?

530
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:10,120
- You're a good man.
- Forget it.

531
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,280
- Would he like a drink too?
- Give it to him.

532
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,600
What about that other problem?

533
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,560
We'll go, for sure.
Perhaps tomorrow.

534
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,680
Why not today?!

535
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,440
We shouldn't.
Lady was there today.

536
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,960
- How do you know?
- Boruch told me.

537
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,880
- But he said the lady was blonde.
- What do you mean?

538
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,640
Maybe he doesn't know
what he's talking about...

539
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:44,920
Listen, Gold.

540
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:50,920
I you're lying and making it up,
you'll be sorry.

541
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:53,920
I'm not making it up.
You'll see for yourself.

542
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:57,000
Come and visit me tomorrow.
At 6 p.m.

543
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,080
HOMELAND

544
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,880
I see you're a regular customer here,
Mr Gold.

545
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,760
- Don't even speak like that, doctor.
- Alright.

546
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:46,920
- The usual?
- Yes, please.

547
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,360
Why are you
paying us visits so rarely?

548
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:04,320
- We met 2 days ago.
- Do feel welcome.

549
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:07,000
Today and whenever you feel like it.

550
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:09,640
No...

551
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,760
We shouldn't see
too much of each other.

552
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,400
What's wrong?

553
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:32,280
It's the draught.

554
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:38,560
I thought you were cold.
It's easy to catch a cold.

555
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,560
I'm warm enough.

556
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,840
- Mrs Rebecca plays beautifully.
- She does.

557
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,520
She's been practising.

558
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:07,840
- Shall we?
- No, thank you.

559
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,360
You're not staying for a supper?

560
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:19,400
I'm very grateful but I'm expected
at the hospital. I should go.

561
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,160
- Shame.
- Forgive me.

562
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,080
Come and visit us tomorrow.

563
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,520
I wouldn't.
Not every day.

564
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:38,240
- The wind doesn't stop.
- That's true.

565
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,080
Excuse me, have you got a light?

566
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:21,520
- I don't smoke.
- That's a pity.

567
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:26,840
Rebecca...

568
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:33,920
Stop!

569
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,760
Stop or I'll shoot!

570
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,920
- Is something wrong?
- No.

571
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,520
Listen, doctor. Two haemorrhages.
I bet it's the wind.

572
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,640
- One nurse is not enough.
- I'll do anything you ask for.

573
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,800
A second nurse?
Not a problem.

574
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:18,680
Where did that bump come from?

575
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,040
- I was hit.
- By a car?

576
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,800
No, with a bat.

577
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,800
Whatever you do, don't get in the car.
They get so many people injured.

578
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,360
About the haemorrhage,
I'll deal with it myself.

579
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:32,600
Why tire the nurses?

580
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:38,280
Nurse, make sure
doctor doesn't exhaust himself.

581
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:40,640
He's been working too much lately.

582
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:42,120
One more thing!

583
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:46,200
If there's a patient
with a gunshot wound, do wake me up.

584
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,160
Was it doctor Otherone shouting?

585
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,360
- When?
- Out in the street.

586
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:01,040
Of course not.
I saw him walking off home.

587
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,600
I'm sure it was him.

588
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,080
Why are you laughing?

589
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,040
It's nothing.

590
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,760
Get me some water.

591
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:38,800
- What kind of meat is it?
- Poulard.

592
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,440
- It's a young hen, isn't it?
- Yes.

593
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,360
Very spongy and tender meat.
Poor hen!

594
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,480
Are you all right?

595
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:04,800
I'm not going to eat that,
it's disgusting!

596
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,320
Don't you like it?
Why?

597
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,000
I just don't!

598
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,880
Expect me tonight.
I need to talk to you.

599
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:33,520
Fine.

600
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,240
- Was the operation very painful?
- Just a little.

601
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:50,480
- You're still gaining weight?
- I'm trying to stop it.

602
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:54,640
Yes, of course...

603
01:06:54,640 --> 01:07:00,200
Why didn't you tell me the surgeon
warned you about putting on weight?

604
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:04,360
Do you still find
the smell of gasoline irritating?

605
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:06,720
Didn't I tell you about that?

606
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,400
- But you do love me, Rebecca.
- I do.

607
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,200
You'll always love me,
won't you?

608
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,440
Always.

609
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,800
Why don't you want
to tell me the truth?

610
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:39,040
I'd forgive you, I'd bear it,
just tell me!

611
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,040
Confess, Rebecca!

612
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:48,040
My little one,
what do you actually want?

613
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:53,360
I don't understand a thing.

614
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,840
Will you tell me or not?

615
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,720
What was it
with the unborn child?

616
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,760
What child? I have no idea
what you're talking about.

617
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,240
No idea.
About that either?

618
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:17,920
After the operation you can be
infertile for the rest of your life.

619
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,880
You don't understand that either?!

620
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,000
It must be true then.

621
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,360
Women are mutilated
after such procedures.

622
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:32,480
You'll no longer be a woman!
You won't be capable of love!

623
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:48,000
Poulard.

624
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:20,880
Is anyone here?

625
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,880
- There's no one in the house.
- Our dad is.

626
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
- Which one of you is lying?
- He is.

627
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,240
Yes, it's me.

628
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,600
- Where's your father?
- Dad is dead.

629
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:39,880
Father is in his shop,
your grace.

630
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,120
Greetings, sir.

631
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:49,120
You've got a very talented son,
Mr Gold. He'll make a good engineer.

632
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,600
- Boruch, what's 7x8?
- 9!

633
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,040
You stupid boy!

634
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:58,800
- I'd like to speak to you.
- Come into my shop, please.

635
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,520
Every woman has weed
under her skirt!

636
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:03,920
Be quiet!

637
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:13,320
Gold, I've come to a conclusion
we should go there right now.

638
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:14,680
- No...
- Yes.

639
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,760
- Get dressed.
- I can't go, Mr Widmar.

640
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:22,480
Boruch, this gentleman is sitting
on the ironing-board.

641
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:29,120
- Dollars will get you even to America.
- Boruch, the gentleman is crying.

642
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,640
Our dad has a lantern
in his stomach!

643
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,600
Mr Widmar,

644
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,840
I'm not sure whether
it will happen today or not.

645
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:58,400
It could end up
with your beating today!

646
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,200
Dear sir, can you see the light?

647
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,520
Let go of my arm!

648
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:11,880
I can see it.

649
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,320
Dear Lord...

650
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,760
Let's go.

651
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:23,600
Come on!

652
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,520
Don't do anything wrong though.

653
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,680
How can I help you?

654
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:33,960
- You're a keeper in this house?
- Indeed.

655
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,480
Please tell us,
where doctor Otherone lives.

656
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,280
No one lives here permanently.

657
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,120
There was an accident
in the hospital.

658
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:42,200
We're looking
for surgeon Otherone.

659
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:44,680
You should've said
there was an accident.

660
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,280
He lives on the second floor,
to the left.

661
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,080
Don't tell him we talked.

662
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,600
You'll go first
and knock on that door.

663
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,840
- No...
- You will!

664
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,400
- You'll go right now.
- Never, never.

665
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,920
No...

666
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,240
Or else I'm going to...
You and everyone...

667
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,920
With lead shots, get it?

668
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,560
Lead shots!

669
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:23,120
I can't, Mr Widmar.

670
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,680
Poulard!

671
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,560
I'll do anything.
I'll go anywhere you wish.

672
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:30,560
Just don't shout like that.

673
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,160
You'll go first.

674
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,920
Mr Widmar...

675
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:40,880
You will!

676
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:49,760
Who's there?

677
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,360
Who's there?
I've got a gun.

678
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,000
Gold...

679
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,760
- Have you seen it? She's not there.
- I have.

680
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,160
It's good she's not there.
Very good.

681
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,680
Nothing to be glad about.
Have you seen a scarf?

682
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,600
What scarf?
You've lost a scarf?

683
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,560
You fool!

684
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,480
There's my wife's scarf
on the railing of the bed.

685
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:48,120
Yellow scarf!

686
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:49,920
- My God...
- Listen!

687
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,040
Listen to me, Gold.

688
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,120
I have no doubt now.

689
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,640
Even if she's not here today,
she'll come tomorrow.

690
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,360
And you're going see to it.
I'll wait for you at home.

691
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:09,680
The moment you see my wife,
let me know immediately.

692
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:13,080
- All right.
- I'll give you the money upfront.

693
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,920
You don't even have to
come back here with me.

694
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:23,440
I'll find...

695
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:26,840
my way round.

696
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,920
Doctor!

697
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:00,920
I know where your bed-sitter is!

698
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,560
Are you alright?
Would you like to sit down?

699
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,360
No...
I'm not ill.

700
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:13,680
I only wanted to see the director.

701
01:16:14,160 --> 01:16:17,240
- He's operating at the moment.
- You'll have to wait.

702
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:18,360
Thank you.

703
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,760
Is that your wife who's going to have
her appendix removed?

704
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,600
That's none of your business!

705
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:37,440
I...

706
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:40,880
I have no wife.

707
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,080
Nurse, is director operating?

708
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,200
He's been removing appendix
for an hour.

709
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,440
- For an hour?
- Yes.

710
01:17:57,160 --> 01:18:00,440
- I wanted to see the director.
- He's operating.

711
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:04,160
- How long is it going to take?
- It's his third one day.

712
01:18:04,160 --> 01:18:05,400
We've got 4 more.

713
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,000
What a sick day!

714
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,000
Doctor!

715
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,640
Don't you get it?!
It was abscess!

716
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,520
It had moved right under her heart.

717
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,080
What happened?
She died on the operating table.

718
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,200
Excuse me.

719
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:20,080
You've been waiting
for the director for so long.

720
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,760
Can I help you as a doctor?

721
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,880
Thank you. I wanted
to talk to him strictly privately.

722
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,680
I beg your pardon.

723
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:29,960
It's enough for an old doctor
to look at the patient

724
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,520
and he already knows
the source of the suffering.

725
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:35,440
What would be the diagnosis
in my case?

726
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,800
Unfortunately very common.

727
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,120
There's not one man
who doesn't suffer from that.

728
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:41,080
Really?

729
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,040
What would you prescribe
for that illness?

730
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,160
What would I prescribe?
Time.

731
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,880
Time heals all wounds,
Mr Widmar.

732
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:54,000
Yes...

733
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,720
Thank you.

734
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:57,920
God...

735
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,880
Dear Lord...

736
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:04,960
Don't punish anyone
with misfortune.

737
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:07,560
Don't lead anyone's wife
into temptation.

738
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:15,200
But, good God, let one talented son
of Israel become an engineer.

739
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:19,000
And let the father of that engineer
go to America!

740
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,480
To have many clients
and do great business!

741
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:27,560
Not wander the city, as if he's some
broker, to spy on someone's wife!

742
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:30,160
God...

743
01:22:31,560 --> 01:22:34,480
Dear Lord,
listen to me just for a minute...

744
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,480
Why didn't you come yesterday?

745
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:40,160
Don't be angry at me, my dear.

746
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,360
I've missed you so much!

747
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,720
I couldn't.
He was with me the whole evening.

748
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:55,200
- He was home yesterday?
- Yes. Why?

749
01:24:57,080 --> 01:24:59,200
I thought he was here yesterday.

750
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,160
That's not possible.

751
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:08,320
I can't take it any longer.
You're inconsiderate towards me.

752
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:14,200
You know I'll do anything
you want or tell me to.

753
01:25:14,920 --> 01:25:17,280
Why don't you speak to him?

754
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:19,480
Or let me do it.

755
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,440
I didn't come yesterday because
I was talking to him.

756
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,840
Were you? At last!
What have you told him?

757
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:35,200
That there's someone else.
Someone I love.

758
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:44,240
And that's why
I couldn't be with him now.

759
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,760
- Did you tell him you meant me?
- No.

760
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,920
But I think he knows it's you.

761
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,640
Even if he doesn't,
he must suspect it.

762
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:59,160
We should prepare him for that.
You know he has a heart condition.

763
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:02,560
Do you see, my dear?

764
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,920
My little one...

765
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:14,080
- You'll never leave me.
- I won't. Never.

766
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:15,640
Never!

767
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,520
I wish I could believe that!

768
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,160
I'll show you!

769
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,240
I can't bear it any longer.

770
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,880
I'm going to discover nothing.
Nothing...

771
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:11,000
Was it you who turned off the light?

772
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,560
It obviously wasn't.

773
01:29:16,680 --> 01:29:20,480
- What happened then?
- The bulb must've blown out.

774
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,560
The power is out in the whole town.

775
01:29:36,840 --> 01:29:38,400
I'll take the flashlight.

776
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:54,000
Why are you getting dressed?

777
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:56,320
What time is it?

778
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:11,080
You're distracting me.

779
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,440
You don't treat me well.

780
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:20,720
I forgive you this time as I've
already forgiven you your past.

781
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:24,920
- Even the Uhlan.
- Which one?

782
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:27,640
You know which one.
We've met thanks to him.

783
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:30,120
He was the reason
you got into the hospital.

784
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,320
Don't remind me of him.

785
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,920
I have no idea how that happened.
He was young and immature.

786
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,520
You should've waited for me.

787
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,560
You do know
I never loved before.

788
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:52,440
I have to believe you.
Otherwise I'd stop loving you.

789
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:56,080
I must be trusted.
I never lie.

790
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,400
It's got very late.
I should go.

791
01:31:03,960 --> 01:31:06,880
My scarf.
I must've left it here.

792
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:15,280
Turn it off.

793
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,120
Promise me you'll speak to him,
once and for all.

794
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:32,800
I promise.

795
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,920
I'm so tired because of work
and everything else.

796
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,200
- You'll never leave me?
- Never.

797
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:46,800
Never.

798
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:49,800
Bye.

799
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:02,400
See you tomorrow.

800
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:04,400
- Where?
- Here again.

801
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,760
I'll be at 6 p.m.,
I'll tell you everything.

802
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,280
I'll see you to the door.

803
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:11,760
Stay here.
I better go alone.

804
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,240
Bye.

805
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,400
- You in a car, doctor?
- I can't see why not!

806
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:26,000
I always go by car.

807
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:30,560
There's been an accident.
A man's experienced electric shock.

808
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:38,640
Director!

809
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,720
I'm glad you're here. The patient
in room 7 has suffered an attack.

810
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,560
Where have you been?

811
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,920
Where do you go every day
at this hour?!

812
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:13,600
- I've been to a movie theatre.
- You're lying.

813
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:25,400
- Do you love me, Rebecca?
- You know it only too well.

814
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:28,000
Why do you need to ask?

815
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:36,200
So you're not cheating on me
with the doctor?

816
01:33:38,680 --> 01:33:40,640
My little one,
you're being silly.

817
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,880
I must be trusted.
You can see I find him boring.

818
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:50,080
He's here every second day,
hardly saying anything.

819
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,720
Why are you torturing yourself?
Can't you feel I'm being faithful?

820
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:57,640
Of course...

821
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,560
You've never been unfaithful.
And you never will be.

822
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,600
Am I right?
Promise me.

823
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,680
I won't.
Never.

824
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:11,720
How could I have suspected you?
I should've trusted you!

825
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,400
Forgive me!
Rebecca.

826
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,200
I'm sorry!

827
01:34:17,520 --> 01:34:18,480
I'm sorry.

828
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,480
You shouldn't be.
