Shot that one myself.

13
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:21,069
Really?

14
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,506
He was a tough old
son of a bitch.

15
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,208
Shot him nine times.

16
00:02:27,443 --> 00:02:28,610
But I got him.

17
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,113
Are you all finished?

18
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:33,382
Yes, sir.

19
00:02:33,415 --> 00:02:34,916
Ah, you can call me Ed.

20
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:37,118
Follow me.

21
00:02:40,955 --> 00:02:43,925
You ever work at a
gas station before?

22
00:02:44,192 --> 00:02:45,193
No.

23
00:02:45,594 --> 00:02:46,595
You own your own car?

24
00:02:48,464 --> 00:02:49,565
Uh, not yet.

25
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,303
But my friend can drive me
here, and I can get the bus.

26
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,169
Okay.

27
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:03,445
Well, what we're
looking for is someone

28
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,646
to work the night shift.

29
00:03:06,047 --> 00:03:08,283
From ten to six in the morning.

30
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:09,651
Just to let you know,

31
00:03:09,685 --> 00:03:12,454
we don't get a lot of
business during the night.

32
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:15,491
You will get some hunters
and farmers rolling

33
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:17,326
in around four or five.

34
00:03:18,293 --> 00:03:19,528
These hours work for you?

35
00:03:20,295 --> 00:03:22,598
Yeah, I can work
whenever you want.

36
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:29,170
I wish you had a
little more experience.

37
00:03:29,204 --> 00:03:31,440
I'm a really fast learner.

38
00:03:31,473 --> 00:03:32,974
And a hard worker.

39
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:38,647
So, you were
convicted of a felony.

40
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,451
Yeah.

41
00:03:44,085 --> 00:03:44,986
Did you go to prison?

42
00:03:48,357 --> 00:03:49,491
For a little while.

43
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:52,528
For what?

44
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:02,538
I set my boyfriend on fire.

45
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:11,680
Did he deserve it?

46
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:16,652
Yeah.

47
00:04:18,152 --> 00:04:19,288
When did you get out?

48
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:21,055
Two weeks ago.

49
00:04:22,424 --> 00:04:24,593
My parole officer told
me about this place.

50
00:04:24,827 --> 00:04:26,562
So you have a parole officer?

51
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:27,696
Tom Doogan.

52
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:31,266
He's the one told
me about this job.

53
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,568
I know Tom.

54
00:04:33,602 --> 00:04:34,636
I...

55
00:04:39,475 --> 00:04:41,310
I really need this job.

56
00:04:42,411 --> 00:04:45,079
Well, I had an
interview this morning.

57
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:47,549
And to be honest, I
didn't like him too much.

58
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,618
He reminded me of my
daughter's husband,

59
00:04:49,651 --> 00:04:51,520
and he's an asshole.

60
00:04:53,589 --> 00:04:55,724
I go a lot on my gut feelings.

61
00:04:57,693 --> 00:05:00,194
You promise you won't
give me any shit?

62
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,530
Yeah, I promise.

63
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:04,466
All right.

64
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,634
You got the job.

65
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:09,538
Thank you.

66
00:05:11,507 --> 00:05:15,042
I've just been, I've looking
for a job since I got out.

67
00:05:15,076 --> 00:05:17,779
So, this is really great.

68
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:20,582
You won't regret it.

69
00:05:20,616 --> 00:05:22,083
Can you start tonight?

70
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:23,685
Yeah, absolutely.

71
00:05:24,653 --> 00:05:27,623
Do you have a number
I can reach you at?

72
00:05:27,656 --> 00:05:31,326
No, I don't have a
cell phone right now.

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,427
Home phone?

74
00:05:33,662 --> 00:05:36,331
Get here around 9:30.

75
00:05:36,365 --> 00:05:37,766
Bobby will give
you the walk-through

76
00:05:37,799 --> 00:05:40,101
and show you how to
run the register.

77
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:42,538
Okay.

78
00:05:44,473 --> 00:05:45,841
It's good meeting you, Mary.

79
00:05:45,874 --> 00:05:47,476
And good luck.

80
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:48,644
Thanks.

81
00:05:49,778 --> 00:05:52,281
Tell Tom he
owes me a six pack.

82
00:06:04,626 --> 00:06:05,661
So?

83
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:08,129
I got it.

84
00:06:08,797 --> 00:06:10,766
Oh my God, Mary!

85
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:12,166
Congratulations.

86
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:14,570
It doesn't pay very very will.

87
00:06:14,603 --> 00:06:16,672
And I'll have to work
the graveyard shift.

88
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:19,675
But, I'll take what I
can get, right?

89
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:20,576
Absolutely.

90
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:21,610
You need a job.

91
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:23,478
It's a great first step.

92
00:06:23,512 --> 00:06:25,614
So, when do you start?

93
00:06:25,814 --> 00:06:27,316
Tonight.

94
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:29,116
Wow, that was fast.

95
00:06:30,385 --> 00:06:31,453
Yeah.

96
00:06:31,486 --> 00:06:33,855
I'm going to take you to
lunch today to celebrate.

97
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:34,723
What are your plans?

98
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:37,759
Uh, I need to meet my
parole officer at 11.

99
00:06:38,427 --> 00:06:40,662
Let's meet at Canton
Square at like, 12:30?

100
00:06:41,195 --> 00:06:42,163
Okay.

101
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,766
I think this is the
start of a new life.

102
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,793
12:30.

103
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:46,662
I'll see you then.

104
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,238
Stop!

105
00:08:30,972 --> 00:08:32,741
Oh my God.

106
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:36,978
I did it all for you, Mary.

I know you like to watch.

113
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:04,740
No.

114
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:11,780
You're not real.

115
00:09:16,885 --> 00:09:18,320

Hey, are you okay?

120
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,521
Yeah, yeah.

121
00:09:52,554 --> 00:09:53,388
I'm fine.

122
00:09:56,558 --> 00:09:58,059
Why, why didn't you knock?

123
00:09:58,093 --> 00:09:59,995
You can't just walk
into people's apartments.

124
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:02,430
The door was open.

125
00:10:03,498 --> 00:10:04,966
Is it 11 o'clock already?

126
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:06,067
Yeah.

127
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:09,371
Who's in the bathroom?

128
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:11,973
Nobody.

129
00:10:28,023 --> 00:10:30,392
Who were you talking to?

130
00:10:31,092 --> 00:10:32,527
I wasn't taking to anybody.

131
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:53,548
I tried calling you.

132
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:54,549
What's wrong with your phone?

133
00:10:57,152 --> 00:10:58,787
It's not plugged in.

134
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,788
Why?

135
00:11:00,488 --> 00:11:01,923
Because I don't want a phone.

136
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:03,658
Plug your phone in.

137
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,661
This isn't a request.

138
00:11:06,695 --> 00:11:07,929
If I can't get hold of
you things are going

139
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:09,064
to get very difficult.

140
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,603
Listen, I know all about
you and your boyfriend.

141
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:15,704
I'm sure you're going
to carrying that

142
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:16,938
around with you your whole life.

143
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,910
But you have a chance now to
do something with yourself.

144
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:24,846
So don't fuck it up.

145
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,982
I'm not crazy, you know.

146
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:29,985
The file says paranoid
and delusional,

147
00:11:30,018 --> 00:11:31,953
who suffers from hallucinations.

148
00:11:34,556 --> 00:11:35,991
You know, I didn't do anything.

149
00:11:36,024 --> 00:11:38,159
Then why are you here?

150
00:11:38,193 --> 00:11:40,996
You need to save the denial
speeches for someone who cares.

151
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:46,968
I got a job.

152
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,036
Good for you.

153
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:51,006
Where?

154
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,008
Deer Gas Market.

155
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,110
I see.

156
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:56,912
You took my advice.

157
00:11:58,046 --> 00:11:59,781
Ed says you owe him a six pack.

158
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:03,084
Yeah, I owe that old bastard
more than a six pack.

159
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:04,786
When do you start?

160
00:12:05,687 --> 00:12:06,488
Tonight.

161
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:09,124
Well that's good.

162
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:09,958
Thanks.

163
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,961
I'll check in with you tonight.

164
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:26,242
Just to fill you in
on a little secret.

165
00:12:26,275 --> 00:12:28,176
There were a lot of people
didn't want you released.

166
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,179
They think you're
still highly unstable.

167
00:12:31,213 --> 00:12:34,516
A lot of families and
officials want you to fail.

168
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:36,084
They'd like nothing
better than for you

169
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:37,485
to do something stupid.

170
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,055
So they can use it
against you, lock you up

171
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:41,189
and throw away the key.

172
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:44,626
Just like your boyfriend.

173
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,495
And guess who's their only
source of information?

174
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,498
- You.
- That's right.

175
00:12:50,532 --> 00:12:53,969
So walk the line, report
back to me everyday,

176
00:12:54,002 --> 00:12:56,972
and I'll make sure
you stay out of jail.

177
00:12:57,005 --> 00:12:57,872
Is that understood?

178
00:13:00,108 --> 00:13:01,643
I thought you didn't care.

179
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:02,510
I don't.

180
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,224
Hey.

181
00:14:22,258 --> 00:14:23,725
Are you okay?

182
00:14:25,727 --> 00:14:26,928
Yeah.

183
00:14:26,961 --> 00:14:28,230
What were you looking at?

184
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:29,265
Oh, nothing.

185
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:31,866
I just thought I saw someone.

186
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:32,634
Who?

187
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,069
Nobody.

188
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:34,803
Are you ready?

189
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:35,837
Yeah.

190
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,273
You want to go to
Harmond's or the Mayflower?

191
00:14:38,106 --> 00:14:38,907
Mayflower is fine.

192
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,020
♪ Make up my mind ♪

193
00:14:52,053 --> 00:14:54,622
So come on, tell
me more about this job.

194
00:14:55,324 --> 00:14:56,791
What do you want to know?

195
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,028
What did the owner say?

196
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:03,265
He wished I had more experience.

197
00:15:03,299 --> 00:15:04,766
It's a gas station.

198
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:06,668
It's not like it's
rocket surgery.

199
00:15:06,701 --> 00:15:10,071
Yeah but, I've never worked
in a gas station before.

200
00:15:10,105 --> 00:15:11,673
Well, my cousin does.

201
00:15:11,706 --> 00:15:13,074
And he's a fucking idiot.

202
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:15,009
So you'll be just fine.

203
00:15:16,278 --> 00:15:18,280
I can't eat, I'm so nervous.

204
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,316
What the Hell are
you nervous about?

205
00:15:22,318 --> 00:15:23,618
I don't know.

206
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,754
Well, if you're not going
to eat it, can I have it?

207
00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:28,923
Sure.

208
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:38,633
Remember outside when you
asked what I was looking at?

209
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:41,237
Yeah.

210
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,972
Someone was staring at me.

211
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:44,672
Who?

212
00:15:45,274 --> 00:15:47,309
He looked like James.

213
00:15:47,343 --> 00:15:49,110
James is in jail.

214
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:52,046
Yeah, I know.

215
00:15:54,082 --> 00:15:57,219
And, even if by some
miracle he got out,

216
00:15:57,253 --> 00:15:59,187
I doubt he could even walk.

217
00:15:59,221 --> 00:16:00,456
You burnt the guy to a crisp.

218
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:16,372
Hey, are you sure you're okay?

219
00:16:18,173 --> 00:16:19,974
Uh, yeah.

220
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,745
Are you taking your medicine?

221
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,282
Yeah.

222
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:29,817
Yeah... but?

223
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:32,921
I'm still having those
episodes every now and again.

224
00:16:34,523 --> 00:16:35,357
Jesus.

225
00:16:36,592 --> 00:16:40,229
Don't tell your parole officer
or your doctor any of this.

226
00:16:40,262 --> 00:16:41,763
I won't.

227
00:16:41,796 --> 00:16:43,299
They'll throw your
ass away for life.

228
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:47,068
Do you think I'm
going to be alright?

229
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:53,242
Listen, you've been
through a lot of shit.

230
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,345
I can't even imagine
what it was like.

231
00:16:56,378 --> 00:16:59,747
But you can't keep
living in the past.

232
00:17:01,049 --> 00:17:02,251
You did your time.

233
00:17:02,284 --> 00:17:04,286
And what's done is done.

234
00:17:05,554 --> 00:17:07,223
You have to move on.

235
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:09,190
Yeah.

236
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,060
You're right.

237
00:17:14,296 --> 00:17:16,265
Everything's gonna be great.

238
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:17,865
Come on.

239
00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:18,900
Let's get out of here.

240
00:17:56,505 --> 00:17:57,406

241
00:17:57,439 --> 00:18:01,510
I'm glad you
plugged your phone in.

242
00:18:01,543 --> 00:18:03,111
I told you I would.

243
00:18:03,911 --> 00:18:05,146
Good job, Mary.

244
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:07,316
I hope your job goes well.

245
00:18:07,349 --> 00:18:08,550
Thanks.

246
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:09,784

Well...

272
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,709
James would call

and play that song
over the phone.

00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,620
That's how I knew he was
going to kill someone.

God, that's so fucked up.

276
00:20:32,694 --> 00:20:35,597
Is that why you
don't want a phone?

277
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:40,067
One of the many reasons.

278
00:20:43,572 --> 00:20:48,176
You know, you're the only
one who has stuck by me.

279
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:51,380
I never would have been able

280
00:20:51,413 --> 00:20:53,682
to do any of this without you.

281
00:20:56,017 --> 00:20:57,151
So, thank you.

282
00:20:58,687 --> 00:21:01,490
You don't have to thank me.

283
00:21:01,523 --> 00:21:03,191
We've been friends
since we were five.

284
00:21:03,225 --> 00:21:04,726
You're like family to me.

285
00:21:07,028 --> 00:21:09,565
I'll never turn my back on you.

286
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,067
I know what everyone
says about me.

287
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,736
Yeah, well you know
what I say to them?

288
00:21:15,671 --> 00:21:16,505
What?

289
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:17,606
Go fuck yourself.

290
00:21:42,564 --> 00:21:44,533
Are you sure you
want to work here?

291
00:21:47,736 --> 00:21:49,671
I don't really have a choice.

292
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:54,443
This place is in the
middle of nowhere.

293
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,546
I don't like you being
out here all by yourself.

294
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,147
I'll be fine.

295
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,385
What are you doing?

296
00:22:03,652 --> 00:22:04,686
I'm coming in.

297
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:07,523
I need to see what this shithole
looks like on the inside.

298
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:25,440
Hi.

299
00:22:25,641 --> 00:22:26,608
Can I help you?

300
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:27,543
I'm Mary.

301
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,547
I'm supposed to
start work tonight.

302
00:22:32,714 --> 00:22:33,715
Oh, right.

303
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:36,150
Hi, I'm Bobby.

304
00:22:36,183 --> 00:22:37,753
- Hi.
- Hi.

305
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:39,086
And this is Deb.

306
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,087
Oh, hi.

307
00:22:40,121 --> 00:22:40,789
Do you sell beer?

308
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:41,757
Oh yeah.

309
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,524
It's right in the back.

310
00:22:45,427 --> 00:22:47,563
So, Ed says this
is your first time

311
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:49,196
working in a gas station?

312
00:22:49,665 --> 00:22:50,332
Yeah.

313
00:22:50,365 --> 00:22:52,267
Okay. Well, it's
pretty easy.

314
00:22:52,301 --> 00:22:54,469
So, you don't have to
worry about a thing.

315
00:22:55,437 --> 00:22:57,706
Do you want to see what's
going on back here.

316
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,207
Yeah.

317
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:02,477
So this is the cash register.

318
00:23:02,511 --> 00:23:04,713
And this is the scanner.

319
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:06,615
You just scan the item.

320
00:23:06,648 --> 00:23:08,550
Press this button
and this button.

321
00:23:08,584 --> 00:23:10,252
And when people pay
for gas they have

322
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:11,720
to come inside because
the pumps are old

323
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:12,754
and they're not automated.

324
00:23:14,723 --> 00:23:16,291
I'll take a pack of Spirits.

325
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:17,659
Okay.

326
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:20,796
Just make sure that you card

327
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:22,731
because I got in
trouble once for selling

328
00:23:22,764 --> 00:23:23,732
to a 12-year-old.

329
00:23:24,499 --> 00:23:26,668
You sold cigarettes
to 12-year-old?

330
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:29,271
She had boobs.

331
00:23:29,504 --> 00:23:31,406
So, it was confusing.

332
00:23:31,673 --> 00:23:34,175
Uh...

333
00:23:34,209 --> 00:23:36,478
Yeah, so you want
to ring her up?

334
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:38,847
Uh... uh sure.

335
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,315
All right.

336
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,151
And, is that
debit or credit?

337
00:23:44,386 --> 00:23:45,687
Uh, is that debit or credit?

338
00:23:46,388 --> 00:23:47,856
- Debit.
- Okay.

339
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,793
That will be $9.75, please.

340
00:23:59,601 --> 00:24:00,602
See?

341
00:24:00,636 --> 00:24:01,737
Easy as that.

342
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,504
Good job!

343
00:24:02,704 --> 00:24:04,406
- Thanks.
- All right.

344
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,675
Okay, so I'll get
you a set of keys

345
00:24:06,708 --> 00:24:07,943
and I'll show you around
the rest of the store.

346
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:09,411
- Okay.
- All right.

347
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:16,685
He's kind of cute.

348
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:18,420
For a guy that works
at a gas station.

349
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:22,924
So, are you going to
stay here all night?

350
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:24,960
No, I'm leaving.

351
00:24:24,993 --> 00:24:27,496
I just wanted to make sure
everything was all right.

352
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,898
Everything's fine.

353
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:33,201
I'll call and check
up on you later.

354
00:24:33,235 --> 00:24:33,869
Okay.

355
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:38,273
And don't get too drunk.

356
00:24:38,306 --> 00:24:39,841
You have to pick me up at six.

357
00:24:39,875 --> 00:24:41,677
When have I <i>ever</i>
gotten too drunk?

358
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:56,425
Ok.

359
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:26,955
Fuck!

360
00:25:51,947 --> 00:25:53,615
We only have five channels.

361
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:55,917
That's fine.

362
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:57,719
I'm not going to be watching
that much television.

363
00:25:58,153 --> 00:25:59,154
You say that now,

364
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:00,889
but by three a.m., you're
going to be begging

365
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:03,892
for some crappy
TV show to watch.

366
00:26:04,593 --> 00:26:05,427
Trust me.

367
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:07,763
Okay.

368
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,831
Here are the keys to this store.

369
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:13,001
This round one opens
the front door, okay?

370
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:14,870
So if you leave the market,
you're going to have to

371
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:16,738
use this to lock the
door behind you.

372
00:26:16,972 --> 00:26:20,942
This thin one opens the back
door and the bathroom door,

373
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:23,712
and Ed likes to keep that
door locked at all times.

374
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:24,513
Okay?

375
00:26:24,913 --> 00:26:26,915
And what's that one for?

376
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,683
What do you think it's for?

377
00:26:29,785 --> 00:26:30,786
Outdoor bathroom?

378
00:26:32,988 --> 00:26:34,356
You are a fast learner.

379
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:38,360
Alright, I think
that's pretty good.

380
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:41,596
Uh, I think you're ready
for your first night.

381
00:26:42,931 --> 00:26:44,833
Uh, it should be a slow one.

382
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:46,468
Monday's are always slow.

383
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:48,603
Mmmm.

384
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:57,045
Just call me if you
have any problems.

385
00:26:57,078 --> 00:26:58,046
Okay?

386
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:02,050
Ed wants me to check in
on you later on tonight,

387
00:27:02,083 --> 00:27:03,885
to see if everything's okay.

388
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:04,719
Okay.

389
00:27:04,753 --> 00:27:06,888
Got anymore questions
before I go?

390
00:27:06,922 --> 00:27:07,923
Uh...

391
00:27:09,658 --> 00:27:11,426
has this place
ever been robbed?

392
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:15,096
Uh, well...

393
00:27:16,398 --> 00:27:16,932
I mean...

394
00:27:20,902 --> 00:27:22,103
only by me.

395
00:27:23,738 --> 00:27:25,807
Now, you can eat and
drink anything you want.

396
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:28,677
Just keep your hands off,
these babies are mine,

397
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:29,878
and I have seniority.

398
00:27:30,178 --> 00:27:31,613
I'm okay, thanks.

399
00:27:32,714 --> 00:27:33,849
Ed never notices.

400
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:35,417
Leave it in the
dumpster out back.

401
00:27:37,953 --> 00:27:39,855
Uh, and if you smoke,
do it outside.

402
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:41,857
Okay.

403
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,861
Well, I guess that's it.

404
00:27:46,394 --> 00:27:47,996
I'll see you later, Mary.

405
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:49,397
See ya.

406
00:27:53,435 --> 00:27:54,936
I hate the rain.

407
00:28:45,954 --> 00:28:47,188
Ew, gross.

408
00:29:23,124 --> 00:29:25,060
<i>The brain is ready.</i>

409
00:29:27,095 --> 00:29:28,129
<i>The patient is ready.</i>

410
00:29:28,163 --> 00:29:29,164
<i>Good.</i>

411
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:45,573
Ugh.

412
00:32:26,342 --> 00:32:27,175
Hello?

413
00:33:27,336 --> 00:33:29,205
Deer Gas Market, this is Mary.

414
00:33:29,238 --> 00:33:30,406
<i>How late
are you open until?</i>

415
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:32,441
We're open 24 hours.

416
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:33,442
<i>Thank you.</i>

417
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:49,425
Deer Gas Market, this is Mary.

418
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:50,825
<i>How late
are you open until?</i>

419
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:53,995
Didn't you just call?

420
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:21,423
Deer Gas Market, this is Mary.

421
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,292
<i>How late
are you open until?</i>

422
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:25,361
You already...

423
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:26,794
<i>Do you like
watching people die?</i>

424
00:34:55,658 --> 00:34:56,592
<i>Hey, this is Debbie.</i>

425
00:34:56,625 --> 00:34:58,126
<i>Thanks for Calling.</i>

426
00:34:58,159 --> 00:34:59,861
Hey Deb, it's me calling.

427
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,964
Could you call me at
the number I left?

428
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:05,234
I really need to talk to you.

429
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:17,639
Get a grip.

430
00:36:34,155 --> 00:36:34,989
Shit.

431
00:36:54,376 --> 00:36:55,109
Hey.

432
00:36:55,544 --> 00:36:56,278
Hi.

433
00:36:56,311 --> 00:36:57,044
Is Ed here?

434
00:36:57,546 --> 00:36:59,080
No, he's not in until morning.

435
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:00,014
Uh-huh.

436
00:37:01,517 --> 00:37:03,519
Uh, fill her up, diesel.

437
00:37:04,753 --> 00:37:05,487
Um...

438
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:07,523
Is that pump number two?

439
00:37:08,223 --> 00:37:09,224
Yes ma'am.

440
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:11,926
Okay.

441
00:37:49,565 --> 00:37:51,633
It's not a good
night to be outside.

442
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,335
I'll tell you that for free.

443
00:37:54,536 --> 00:37:56,738
I haven't seen you
around here before.

444
00:37:56,772 --> 00:37:59,140
Oh, it's my first night.

445
00:38:01,108 --> 00:38:01,677
How do you like it?

446
00:38:02,711 --> 00:38:03,612
Yeah.

447
00:38:03,645 --> 00:38:04,513
It's good.

448
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:05,681
So what are you?

449
00:38:05,714 --> 00:38:06,682
You a student or something?

450
00:38:07,048 --> 00:38:08,115
No.

451
00:38:09,585 --> 00:38:11,520
Well, it's about time they got

452
00:38:11,553 --> 00:38:14,021
someone pretty working here.

453
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:18,594
So, why does a beautiful
young woman like yourself

454
00:38:19,628 --> 00:38:21,230
work in a dump like this?

455
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:23,632
'Cause I needed a job.

456
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:26,368
You should get a boyfriend
to take care of you.

457
00:38:26,902 --> 00:38:28,470
I don't have a boyfriend.

458
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:29,338
Oh.

459
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:33,542
Now how come you haven't
got a boyfriend?

460
00:38:34,209 --> 00:38:35,244
Because I tried to kill him.

461
00:38:35,277 --> 00:38:38,480
That'll be $159.75, please.

462
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:44,720
Hot damn.

463
00:38:44,753 --> 00:38:46,421
I think I'm in love.

464
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:49,391
Is that debit, or credit?

465
00:38:49,424 --> 00:38:50,259
Credit.

466
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:55,664
If you ever get tired of
not having a man around,

467
00:38:55,697 --> 00:38:59,668
you know, I'm always
open 24 hours.

468
00:39:01,503 --> 00:39:02,538
Thanks,

469
00:39:02,571 --> 00:39:04,573
but I'm not going to be
dating anyone for a while.

470
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,173
Ah.

471
00:39:09,444 --> 00:39:11,112
What a waste of machinery.

472
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,331
Oh, shit.

473
00:39:32,801 --> 00:39:35,771
Hey, hey, you forgot
your credit card!

474
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,171
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

475
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:10,806
Oh, shit.

476
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:14,676
What the Hell are you doing?

477
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,243
I was screaming your name.

478
00:40:15,277 --> 00:40:16,678
I thought you'd hear me.

479
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:17,613
I didn't.

480
00:40:18,547 --> 00:40:19,314
What are you doing out here?

481
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:21,550
Someone forgot
their credit card.

482
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:23,117
God damn.

483
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,653
Oh my God.
Your lip is bleeding.

484
00:40:24,686 --> 00:40:25,587
Well, yeah, no shit.

485
00:40:25,621 --> 00:40:26,688
You punched me in the face.

486
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:27,823
Sorry.

487
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:28,924
Come on, let's go inside.

488
00:40:28,957 --> 00:40:29,758
Shit.

489
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:35,897
That is some right
hook you got there.

490
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:38,600
I'm sorry.

491
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:39,901
I thought it was somebody else.

492
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:41,803
I'd hate to be
that somebody else.

493
00:40:42,604 --> 00:40:43,438
Yeah.

494
00:40:44,439 --> 00:40:45,273
You would.

495
00:40:47,342 --> 00:40:49,645
Oh, I'm sorry.

496
00:40:49,678 --> 00:40:51,246
It's fine.

497
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:52,280
It's fine.

498
00:40:52,314 --> 00:40:52,848
Sorry.

499
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:58,587
So, what are you doing here?

500
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:02,824
Ed said that he wanted me
to come check up on you.

501
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:06,928
How's everything going?

502
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:10,732
Well, I've had one customer.

503
00:41:13,502 --> 00:41:14,069
You know him?

504
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:16,805
Big, tall, bald-headed
guy, drives a truck?

505
00:41:16,838 --> 00:41:17,806
That's him.

506
00:41:18,006 --> 00:41:18,674
Yeah.

507
00:41:18,707 --> 00:41:20,475
He left that here on purpose.

508
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:23,245
Why would he do that?

509
00:41:23,445 --> 00:41:26,314
Well, because he fucked the
last girl that worked here,

510
00:41:26,348 --> 00:41:27,683
until Ed walked in on them.

511
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:29,885
Ugh.

512
00:41:29,918 --> 00:41:32,421
How could anyone
sleep with that guy?

513
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:35,189
He paid her.

514
00:41:36,992 --> 00:41:38,860
That's disgusting.

515
00:41:39,561 --> 00:41:41,496
He used to fuck her right there.

516
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,364
Oh!

517
00:41:50,405 --> 00:41:52,574
So how is everything going?

518
00:41:56,678 --> 00:41:57,579
I'm fine.

519
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,415
Ed told me you were in prison?

520
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:02,984
Right.

521
00:42:03,885 --> 00:42:06,388
So that's why he wanted
you to check up on me.

522
00:42:06,955 --> 00:42:08,890
Make sure I'm not
stealing anything?

523
00:42:08,924 --> 00:42:11,526
No, he just want to make
sure everything is okay.

524
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:14,262
So?

525
00:42:14,296 --> 00:42:16,264
Looks pretty good from
where I'm standing.

526
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:24,973
Can I ask you a question?

527
00:42:28,643 --> 00:42:29,478
Sure.

528
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:33,515
Why did you set your
boyfriend on fire?

529
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:44,726
I guess word gets
out pretty fast.

530
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:52,834
Do you really want to know?

531
00:42:54,536 --> 00:42:55,837
Do you want to talk about it?

532
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:00,842
Not really.

533
00:43:02,043 --> 00:43:03,345
Yeah, okay.

534
00:43:07,916 --> 00:43:09,584
My boyfriend was, um...

535
00:43:11,987 --> 00:43:13,722
James Lincoln Fields.

536
00:43:15,891 --> 00:43:17,492
The Rain Ripper?

537
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:20,462
Yeah.

538
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,098
He killed like 30 women.

539
00:43:23,131 --> 00:43:23,965
35.

540
00:43:28,036 --> 00:43:30,405
So I guess that makes
you <i>The Watcher.</i>

541
00:43:31,673 --> 00:43:32,507
Yep.

542
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:35,944
That's what the press called me.

543
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,415
You watched all those
girls get killed?

544
00:43:42,984 --> 00:43:44,486
Not all of them.

545
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,522
How'd that
make you feel?

546
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:54,863
Like I wanted to die.

547
00:44:00,135 --> 00:44:02,804
I still want to die every day.

548
00:44:03,272 --> 00:44:04,906
You don't have to
talk about this.

549
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,074
No, it's fine.

550
00:44:09,077 --> 00:44:10,979
How did you find out?

551
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:13,815
You know, that he was...

552
00:44:13,849 --> 00:44:15,016
Killing people?

553
00:44:20,522 --> 00:44:22,524
Can I get a sip of that?

554
00:44:23,959 --> 00:44:24,793
Thanks.

555
00:44:37,873 --> 00:44:41,910
I came home from work
one night and...

556
00:44:44,579 --> 00:44:48,049
the house smelled really bad.

557
00:44:51,653 --> 00:44:53,922
<i>I thought
it was an animal</i>

558
00:44:53,955 --> 00:44:56,691
<i>or a backed up sewer pipe.</i>

559
00:44:57,525 --> 00:45:02,430
<i>So, I want down
into the basement.</i>

560
00:45:03,164 --> 00:45:05,000
<i>And...</i>

561
00:45:07,135 --> 00:45:08,937
<i>it was completely flooded.</i>

562
00:45:14,142 --> 00:45:15,844
The smell was...

563
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:18,647
too much to take.

564
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,752
So, I was about to go
upstairs to get James.

565
00:45:25,186 --> 00:45:26,021
<i>Then I saw.</i>

566
00:45:29,258 --> 00:45:30,558
<i>The body parts.</i>

567
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:36,498
<i>That's when I knew.</i>

568
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,603
<i>He'd been burying bodies
underneath our house.</i>

569
00:45:43,505 --> 00:45:46,041
<i>And I turned around
to get James.</i>

570
00:45:48,576 --> 00:45:50,745
And he was waiting for me.

571
00:45:53,648 --> 00:45:55,183
That's how you knew it was him?

572
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:04,092
I always thought there
was something going on, but...

573
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:09,531
like, I guess I didn't
want to believe it.

574
00:46:18,907 --> 00:46:19,741
Gosh.

575
00:46:23,144 --> 00:46:23,979
What did you do?

576
00:46:28,817 --> 00:46:29,651
Nothing.

577
00:46:32,587 --> 00:46:34,656
I just let it all happen.

578
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:37,959
Why didn't you run?

579
00:46:37,993 --> 00:46:39,828
Why didn't you go to the cops?

580
00:46:42,331 --> 00:46:46,568
He said he was going to
kill me and my whole family.

581
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:52,607
I'm not making
excuses or myself, but...

582
00:46:55,176 --> 00:46:57,213
I was young and scared,

583
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:02,817
and... I didn't know
what else to do.

584
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:13,661
He made me watch after that.

585
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:17,999
What made you stop?

586
00:47:20,035 --> 00:47:23,171
Her name was Christine Rogers.

587
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:27,942
She was so young.

588
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,314
After that I didn't
want to live anymore.

589
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:35,116
So...

590
00:47:37,652 --> 00:47:38,720
while he was sleeping...

591
00:47:41,022 --> 00:47:42,690
I set the house on fire.

592
00:47:45,794 --> 00:47:47,095
With you inside?

593
00:47:54,669 --> 00:47:56,071
He's still alive, right?

594
00:48:00,008 --> 00:48:01,176
And why the rain?

595
00:48:03,044 --> 00:48:05,914
So their souls
could be cleansed.

596
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,125
I got really sick.

597
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:23,031
I couldn't tell what was real,

598
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:25,100
what was not.

599
00:48:28,837 --> 00:48:32,674
I was seeing the
victims everywhere.

600
00:48:35,311 --> 00:48:36,345
How are you doing now?

601
00:48:41,182 --> 00:48:42,851
Good days and bad.

602
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,055
But I'm getting better.

603
00:48:48,022 --> 00:48:49,858
That's good to hear.

604
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:00,668
Could you, uh...

605
00:49:01,836 --> 00:49:03,272
Could you not tell anyone?

606
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:06,741
I won't tell anyone.

607
00:49:06,774 --> 00:49:08,143
I think people are going
to find out though.

608
00:49:09,777 --> 00:49:10,912
Yeah, I know.

609
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:14,883
Look, I gotta go.

610
00:49:16,385 --> 00:49:19,288
- Okay.
- You going to be okay?

611
00:49:19,321 --> 00:49:20,155
Yeah.

612
00:49:26,928 --> 00:49:29,265
Got any questions
for me before I go?

613
00:49:32,401 --> 00:49:34,035
Does anyone actually eat those?

614
00:49:35,237 --> 00:49:37,273
Oh, these little things?

615
00:49:40,842 --> 00:49:42,076
Let's see here.

616
00:49:46,515 --> 00:49:47,349
Mmmm.

617
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:52,288
Oh, ewwww.

618
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:54,356
You don't know what
you're missing.

619
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,225
Oh, God.

620
00:49:57,426 --> 00:49:58,726
That's so gross.

621
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:04,266
Thanks for the
pig's tongue, Mary.

622
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:07,001
I'll tell Ed you're
doing just fine.

623
00:50:08,537 --> 00:50:09,271
Thanks.

624
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:11,105
See you later, Mary.

625
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:11,940
See you.

626
00:50:33,962 --> 00:50:35,163
Do you have a bathroom?

627
00:50:35,964 --> 00:50:37,865
Yeah, it's just outside.

628
00:50:39,468 --> 00:50:40,302

You're not real.

656
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:05,126
What are you doing here?

657
00:56:05,159 --> 00:56:06,060
I was driving by

658
00:56:06,093 --> 00:56:07,629
and I thought I'd
see how you're doing?

659
00:56:08,664 --> 00:56:10,532
It's kind of late for
you to be out, isn't it?

660
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:11,633
I don't sleep much.

661
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:13,468
Don't the phones work here?

662
00:56:13,502 --> 00:56:15,637
You know you really don't have
to keep checking up on me.

663
00:56:15,671 --> 00:56:18,105
I'm not checking up on you.

664
00:56:18,139 --> 00:56:20,141
Ed called me and asked me
some questions about you.

665
00:56:20,509 --> 00:56:21,243
Great.

666
00:56:22,311 --> 00:56:23,512
Did you tell him everything?

667
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:26,014
You know what?

668
00:56:26,048 --> 00:56:27,616
Why don't you just send me back?

669
00:56:27,649 --> 00:56:29,116
Is that what you want?

670
00:56:29,785 --> 00:56:30,986
For your information, I told him

671
00:56:31,019 --> 00:56:33,755
that you were a good person
caught up in a bad situation.

672
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:35,724
And now trying to put
your live back into order.

673
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:37,693
Thanks.

674
00:56:38,125 --> 00:56:39,361
Are you okay?

675
00:56:40,729 --> 00:56:41,597
I'm fine.

676
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:46,602
I'm going to use the
bathroom, where is it?

677
00:56:48,169 --> 00:56:49,605
The one outside's out of order.

678
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:52,274
You'll have to use
the one in the back.

679
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:53,241
The thin key will let you in.

680
00:56:55,243 --> 00:56:55,811
Thanks.

681
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:12,794
Can I help y...?

682
00:57:25,941 --> 00:57:27,174
Hello, Mary.

683
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:32,681
You're not real, you're
not real, you're not real.

684
00:57:42,891 --> 00:57:43,825
I'm real.

685
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:54,836
I heard they let you out,

686
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,805
so I thought I'd come
see how you're doing.

687
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:01,843
You still don't think
I'm real, do you?

688
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:05,747
Mmm.

689
00:58:05,781 --> 00:58:07,616
You still seeing things
you don't want to believe?

690
00:58:10,419 --> 00:58:12,220
Well, you're just like me, Mary.

691
00:58:12,254 --> 00:58:13,922
You liked watching them die.

692
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:15,791
I'm not like you.

693
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:17,826
You're worse.

694
00:58:19,561 --> 00:58:21,430
You could have stopped me.

695
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:22,731
But you didn't.

696
00:58:23,865 --> 00:58:25,434
You let people die.

697
00:58:26,668 --> 00:58:27,903
<i>Innocent</i> people die.

698
00:58:28,937 --> 00:58:29,971
I was sick.

699
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:32,774
Still believing in your lies?

700
00:58:34,409 --> 00:58:35,243
<i>Still.</i>

701
00:58:38,814 --> 00:58:40,816
This is not happening.

702
00:58:43,952 --> 00:58:45,687
You will watch
people die tonight.

703
00:58:47,856 --> 00:58:51,493
And I'll bet you 10 to one

704
00:58:51,526 --> 00:58:52,961
that you will like it.

705
00:58:53,628 --> 00:58:54,463
And then

706
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:58,533
I'll watch you die.

707
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:03,338
And there is nothing
you can do about it.

708
00:59:08,944 --> 00:59:11,580
You know, my parole
officer is in the back.

709
00:59:11,613 --> 00:59:12,781
You don't think I know that?

710
00:59:13,682 --> 00:59:14,816
Well, I'm going to tell him.

711
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:15,884
Mmm.

712
00:59:19,354 --> 00:59:20,922
What if I'm not real?

713
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:26,795
They'll put you
away forever, Mary.

714
00:59:29,698 --> 00:59:31,767
I know you're not real.

715
00:59:32,734 --> 00:59:35,504
And I'm going to
prove it to you.

716
00:59:49,384 --> 00:59:50,552
I'd like some gas, please.

717
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,555
Sure.

718
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:56,057
Can I have $10 on
pump number three?

719
00:59:57,058 --> 00:59:57,893
Okay.

720
01:00:00,495 --> 01:00:02,297
It's really coming
down out there.

721
01:00:03,665 --> 01:00:04,499
Yeah.

722
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,969
And $10 is your change.

723
01:00:09,604 --> 01:00:10,605
Thank you.

724
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,009
How late are you open until?

725
01:00:20,982 --> 01:00:23,518
Why do you keep calling me?

726
01:00:23,552 --> 01:00:24,619
What do you mean?

727
01:00:24,653 --> 01:00:25,921
You called me.

728
01:00:25,954 --> 01:00:26,788
Earlier.

729
01:00:27,656 --> 01:00:28,957
I know it was you.

730
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:31,526
I'm sorry, do I know you?

731
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,061
You know who I am.

732
01:00:33,094 --> 01:00:34,930
What the fuck do you want?

733
01:00:34,963 --> 01:00:37,899
I think you are mistaking
me for someone else, dear.

734
01:00:37,933 --> 01:00:38,900
Don't you lie to me.

735
01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:40,368
I am on to you.

736
01:00:40,402 --> 01:00:42,704
- I am fucking on to you, lady.
- Hey!

737
01:00:42,737 --> 01:00:43,505
What's going on?

738
01:00:43,738 --> 01:00:45,974
This woman has been
calling me all night.

739
01:00:46,007 --> 01:00:47,843
I don't know what
she is talking about.

740
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:49,010
She's one of them.

741
01:00:49,044 --> 01:00:49,911
One of who, Mary?

742
01:00:50,912 --> 01:00:54,749
Okay, someone has been
calling me and making threats.

743
01:00:54,783 --> 01:00:55,951
You think that lady was her?

744
01:00:58,753 --> 01:00:59,988
I don't know.

745
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:01,156
Well, why didn't
you tell me this?

746
01:01:01,189 --> 01:01:03,124
Because I'm paranoid
and delusional.

747
01:01:03,158 --> 01:01:03,959
Remember?

748
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:05,427
Well, you should
have told me this.

749
01:01:07,863 --> 01:01:08,830
Look, you need to
tell me everything

750
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:10,031
and be honest with me.

751
01:01:10,966 --> 01:01:12,434
That's the only way
this is going to work.

752
01:01:14,536 --> 01:01:15,003
You understand?

753
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:16,471
Okay.

754
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:19,941
It's late.

755
01:01:23,879 --> 01:01:25,380
Have a nice night.

756
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:28,650
Thanks.

757
01:01:49,971 --> 01:01:54,009
Debbie?

758
01:03:31,873 --> 01:03:32,974
<i>You've
reached Tom Doogan.</i>

759
01:03:33,008 --> 01:03:34,109
<i>Leave your name and number.</i>

760
01:03:35,076 --> 01:03:37,178
Tom, I need you to call me.

761
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:39,147
I think something's happening.

762
01:03:40,181 --> 01:03:41,850
Please call me.

763
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:54,162
<i>9-1-1.</i>

764
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,168
Everything's fine.

765
01:04:01,703 --> 01:04:03,038
Everything's fine.

766
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,739
Nothing's happening.

767
01:04:11,213 --> 01:04:12,314
Hello?

768
01:04:12,348 --> 01:04:14,316
<i>This is Sam from
emergency services.</i>

769
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:16,184
<i>We received a call
from this number?</i>

770
01:04:16,218 --> 01:04:20,256
Sorry, I thought I hung
up before I connected.

771
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,257
<i>Do you have an emergency?</i>

772
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,758
No, I didn't mean to call.

773
01:04:23,792 --> 01:04:24,626
Sorry.

774
01:05:12,308 --> 01:05:13,375
<i>If you'd
like to make a call...</i>

775
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,243
Fuck.

776
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:08,056
You're not real,
you're not real.

777
01:07:17,466 --> 01:07:18,467
Mary.

778
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,401
Oh my God.

779
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,782
Help me.

780
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:35,817
Help me, please.

781
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:38,354
Hey, settle down.

782
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:41,457
We need to call the police.

783
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,124
He's trying to kill me.

784
01:07:43,157 --> 01:07:44,560
Everything is going
to be all right.

785
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:45,427
You don't understand.

786
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:48,330
Oh fuck.

787
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:49,265
The phone's still dead.

788
01:07:57,439 --> 01:07:59,275
Do you remember her?

789
01:08:08,182 --> 01:08:09,951
She was 18 years old.

790
01:08:11,453 --> 01:08:14,290
She was a freshman in college.

791
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:18,394
She was gonna be a doctor.

792
01:08:20,128 --> 01:08:21,896
But you and that monster,

793
01:08:21,929 --> 01:08:24,400
you took all of
that away from her.

794
01:08:25,967 --> 01:08:26,568
I didn't.

795
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:31,206
You watched him
kill my daughter!

796
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:47,088
When I heard they let you out,

797
01:08:47,121 --> 01:08:49,291
I just had to come and
do something about it.

798
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,393
No!

799
01:10:57,619 --> 01:10:58,620
No!

800
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:06,528
Are you okay?

801
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:07,362
Yeah.

802
01:11:19,408 --> 01:11:20,375
Is she dead?

803
01:11:20,409 --> 01:11:21,243
Yeah.

804
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,246
I tried to call you but
the phones are down.

805
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:25,414
I know.

806
01:11:26,648 --> 01:11:29,183
She said that I
killed her daughter.

807
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:32,788
Her name is Carol Rogers.

808
01:11:32,821 --> 01:11:34,055
Her daughter was Christine.

809
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:36,123
No.

810
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,666
Is anyone ever
going to forgive me?

811
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:46,167
No.

812
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:53,475
Fuck.

813
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:54,276
What's wrong?

814
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:56,645
We have to get
hold of the police.

815
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,515
Why did you come back?

816
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,684
I have something to tell you.

817
01:12:02,718 --> 01:12:03,519
What?

818
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:05,487
Come on we have to go.

819
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,389
No, tell me what it is.

820
01:12:07,422 --> 01:12:08,657
There was an accident
at the prison.

821
01:12:09,625 --> 01:12:10,726
What kind of accident?

822
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:13,662
A major storm shut
the power down.

823
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:15,096
Some prisoners escaped.

824
01:12:16,431 --> 01:12:18,065
James was one of
those prisoners.

825
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:21,503
He's real.

826
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:23,137
They didn't want me to tell you

827
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,239
because they didn't think
he would come after you.

828
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,242
He was here.

829
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:29,545
What?

830
01:12:41,122 --> 01:12:41,823
No.

831
01:12:41,857 --> 01:12:42,691
Don't.

832
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:44,793
Please.

833
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:00,669
I told you I was real.

834
01:14:03,372 --> 01:14:04,840
I'm sorry for hitting you.

835
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:06,173
You okay?

836
01:14:11,413 --> 01:14:12,414
I've been watching you.

837
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,523
I really thought that woman
was going to kill you.

838
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:34,536
Then Tom did me a favor.

839
01:14:34,569 --> 01:14:36,605
He killed her so
I didn't have to.

840
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:39,274
And now we're together again.

841
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:45,213
Just like old times.

842
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:47,783
What are you going to do?

843
01:14:49,317 --> 01:14:50,452
You know what I'm going to do.

844
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:54,423
No, please don't.

845
01:15:01,697 --> 01:15:02,497
Debbie.

846
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:07,936
You don't have to do this.

847
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:09,871
Yes I do.

848
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,428
I trusted you.

849
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,733
And this is how you repay me.

850
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:39,768
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

851
01:15:40,635 --> 01:15:41,503
You should be.

852
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:43,805
No.

853
01:15:52,414 --> 01:15:53,415
Watch me, Mary.

854
01:15:54,616 --> 01:15:55,317
No.

855
01:15:55,584 --> 01:15:56,418
Watch!

856
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:25,847
Watch me, Mary.

857
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:29,618
No, no, no.

858
01:16:51,473 --> 01:16:53,408
Please, please don't.

859
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:55,977
Please, please.

860
01:16:56,011 --> 01:16:57,445
Debbie.

861
01:16:57,646 --> 01:16:58,547
Please stop.

862
01:16:58,880 --> 01:16:59,748
Tell me you love me.

863
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:01,983
No.

864
01:17:02,717 --> 01:17:04,920
Tell me you love me and
I won't let her die.

865
01:17:12,027 --> 01:17:13,328
I love you.

866
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:15,697
I love you too.

867
01:17:27,609 --> 01:17:29,744
I love you so much.

868
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:30,645
Fuck!

869
01:17:31,746 --> 01:17:32,681
I do this all for you.

870
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:33,915
You know that, don't you?

871
01:17:59,007 --> 01:17:59,808
Debbie.

872
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,188
Phew.

873
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:26,167
You like to watch, don't you?

874
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:32,507
Say it.

875
01:18:34,175 --> 01:18:35,010
No.

876
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:40,982
You disappoint me, Mary.

877
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:48,924
You like watching
people burn, don't you?

878
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:51,860
Fuck you.

879
01:19:18,687 --> 01:19:20,855
Soon we'll be together again.

880
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:24,025
I will never be with you.

881
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:30,799
Help me!

882
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:31,800
Help me!

883
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,058
Ed keeps a gun in his locker.

884
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:31,092
What?

885
01:20:31,126 --> 01:20:31,860
In his locker, 37.

886
01:20:31,893 --> 01:20:32,395
It's right there.

887
01:20:32,428 --> 01:20:33,695
- Go get it.
- Ok.

888
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:35,231
Go get it before he comes back.

889
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:39,268
The one with the lock.

890
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,101
Do you have a key?

891
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,136
No.

892
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,137
Fuck.

893
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,674
Mary, Mary, there's
a pipe right there.

894
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:47,742
There's a pipe right there.

895
01:20:57,052 --> 01:20:57,852
Hello?

896
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,070
Shit.

897
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:23,279
Hey, darling!

898
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:24,145
You here?

899
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:26,815
I forgot my credit card.

900
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:28,583
Hey.

901
01:21:28,616 --> 01:21:30,652
See that little
lever, on the top?

902
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:31,953
That opens the rifle.

903
01:21:34,423 --> 01:21:36,091
Put two shells in.

904
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:38,860
That's a girl.

905
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,097
Hurry up.

906
01:21:43,332 --> 01:21:45,867
Hurry up, hurry, hurry.

907
01:22:11,192 --> 01:22:11,993
Shit.

908
01:22:13,862 --> 01:22:14,662
Oh, Jesus.

909
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:19,235
Untie me, untie me.

910
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:20,302
There you go.

911
01:22:24,739 --> 01:22:26,141
Come on.

912
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:34,182
<i>9-1-1, please
state your emergency.</i>

913
01:22:34,517 --> 01:22:37,085
I'm at Deer Gas
Market, off Highway Six.

914
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:40,121
I think someone might
have robbed the place.

915
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:41,189
You better send a car down here.

916
01:22:42,224 --> 01:22:43,325
<i>Sir, please
stay in your car</i>

917
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:45,093
<i>until the authorities arrive.</i>

918
01:22:45,126 --> 01:22:47,061
Uh-huh, will do.

919
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:13,087
Just keep that rifle
trained on the door.

920
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:15,957
As soon as he walks
in, pull the trigger.

921
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:18,960
I won't die here.

922
01:23:18,993 --> 01:23:20,362
I won't fucking die here.

923
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:28,169
I'm supposed to
pick you up at six.

924
01:23:36,212 --> 01:23:38,314
Keep it covered.
Keep it covered.

925
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:45,787
As soon as he walks
in, blow him away.

926
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,378
Shit.

927
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:10,412
Get ready.

928
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:41,042
Come on, you fucker.

929
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:04,165
- I shot him.
- Come on.

930
01:25:17,513 --> 01:25:18,347
Oh, no.

931
01:25:26,322 --> 01:25:27,356
It's not him.

932
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:31,527
I shot someone.

933
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:33,595
It's not your fault.

934
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:37,366
You didn't know.

935
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:40,302
I did, I pulled the trigger.

936
01:25:40,703 --> 01:25:41,903
Give me the gun.

937
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,073
And the shells. Come on.

938
01:25:49,911 --> 01:25:51,280
It's my fucking fault.

939
01:26:05,527 --> 01:26:07,363
If he walks through that door,

940
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:08,863
I'll blow his fucking head off.

941
01:26:09,631 --> 01:26:12,166
No, no we can't stay here.

942
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:14,403
We'll die.

943
01:26:15,237 --> 01:26:16,070
Come on.

944
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:39,361
Stay close to me.

945
01:26:41,397 --> 01:26:43,399
How many rounds you got?

946
01:26:44,400 --> 01:26:45,199
Two.

947
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:46,602
Okay.

948
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:48,169
Okay.

949
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:07,456
The Police are here.

950
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:08,490
Yeah.

951
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:09,558
Okay, let's go.

952
01:27:11,192 --> 01:27:12,026
Come on.

953
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:29,043
Oh fuck.

954
01:27:41,657 --> 01:27:43,057
This is Officer Collins.

955
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:46,662
I'm out on Old Cold Bank
Road, Deer Gas Market,

956
01:27:46,695 --> 01:27:48,597
responding to a 9-1-1 call.

957
01:27:49,798 --> 01:27:51,165
Hopping out to have a look.

958
01:27:56,705 --> 01:27:57,673
Oh, please!

959
01:27:57,706 --> 01:27:58,540
Get on the ground!

960
01:27:58,574 --> 01:27:59,608
He's gonna kill me!

961
01:27:59,641 --> 01:28:00,476
- No, on the ground.
- Please.

962
01:28:00,509 --> 01:28:01,410
Calm down.

963
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:02,744
Is anybody else in there?

964
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,247
Yes, he's coming.

965
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,582
We need to leave now.

966
01:28:06,815 --> 01:28:07,616
Stand up.

967
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,384
Slowly.

968
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:11,553
Tell me what's going on.

969
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:13,555
He's in the store.

970
01:28:13,956 --> 01:28:14,989
<i>Who's</i> in the store?

971
01:28:15,591 --> 01:28:17,493
James Lincoln Fields.

972
01:28:17,526 --> 01:28:18,627
He's coming after me.

973
01:28:19,561 --> 01:28:20,562
Get in the car.

974
01:28:20,596 --> 01:28:21,263
Get in the car.

975
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:34,676
This is officer Collins...

976
01:28:35,076 --> 01:28:36,345
No, no!

977
01:29:37,606 --> 01:29:38,440
Hello?

978
01:29:57,926 --> 01:29:58,760
Hello?

979
01:32:33,982 --> 01:32:34,783
Hey!

980
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:36,818
Stop, stop, stop!

981
01:32:36,852 --> 01:32:38,420
Hey, stop!

982
01:32:38,453 --> 01:32:39,554
Please, stop!

983
01:33:34,876 --> 01:33:36,044
Mary!

984
01:33:41,883 --> 01:33:42,918
Fuck.

985
01:34:09,878 --> 01:34:10,979
Stay with me.

986
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:25,727
I'm not leaving here
without you, Mary.

987
01:34:35,003 --> 01:34:36,771
It's time to go home.

988
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:33,154
<i>9-1-1, Please
state your emergency.</i>

989
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:46,101
I love you.

990
