1
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,846
Who killed Brother Zhang?

2
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:46,071
The Masked Avengers.

3
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:49,408
They stop at no evil.

4
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,639
We've spent over half a year's time,

5
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:53,940
but still can't find anything about them.

6
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,141
Brother Zhang, have you heard anything?

7
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:00,042
I...

8
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:10,340
Nothing at all.

9
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:11,504
No.

10
00:03:17,247 --> 00:03:18,508
There's some news.

11
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,439
Brother Zhang went to investigate
the Masked Avengers,

12
00:03:24,547 --> 00:03:28,377
he fled after being attacked.

13
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,913
He found out that
they are based in Jingyang Town.

14
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,912
Jingyang Town?

15
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,710
It'd take just a few days
to reach there, let's...

16
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:58,508
They work under a Chief,

17
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,943
and wear masks when they're killing.

18
00:04:01,047 --> 00:04:03,673
The Chief's mask is golden,

19
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:05,576
and uses a golden trident.

20
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,141
Chicken blood? That's dull.

21
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:51,805
I'll give you another type of blood.

22
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,169
Du Gang, you always claim to be brave,

23
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,041
what's the matter with you now?

24
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:04,409
You thieves raided on me,

25
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:06,673
and killed my family of twenty eight.

26
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:09,804
As long as there's one of us left,

27
00:06:09,913 --> 00:06:12,539
he will kill you all for revenge.

28
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:16,806
Wait a minute, I know that your family

29
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:19,004
has twenty nine people in total,

30
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:21,306
why did you say twenty eight?

31
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,574
Did your brother Du Meng get away?

32
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,408
He'll come back and revenge for you?

33
00:06:26,514 --> 00:06:27,741
That's right.

34
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,778
Yes.

35
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,805
Eldest brother...

36
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:44,038
Second brother.

37
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:46,113
Eldest brother...

38
00:06:46,213 --> 00:06:47,803
Second brother.

39
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,574
How could we let anyone escape?

40
00:06:52,681 --> 00:06:57,670
Let me be clear;

41
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,410
We were paid by your enemies

42
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:11,639
to get rid of the twenty nine of you.

43
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:13,837
I could use it all now.

44
00:07:18,714 --> 00:07:21,441
Alright, everyone got your share,

45
00:07:21,547 --> 00:07:24,035
let's do our job.

46
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:26,942
Let's get rid of the Du Family!

47
00:07:39,447 --> 00:07:42,140
Your whole family's dead.

48
00:07:42,247 --> 00:07:45,702
There's no hope left, and you can die now.

49
00:07:45,813 --> 00:07:47,609
I can never die in peace.

50
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:51,909
That's what I'm hoping for.

51
00:07:59,013 --> 00:08:02,968
Chief, Jingyang Town.

52
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,569
That's all we know.

53
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:09,113
Jingyang Town?
Doesn't Ling Yunzhi live there?

54
00:08:09,213 --> 00:08:10,679
He's from a well-known family there,

55
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,906
we could find him and investigate.

56
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:16,673
Ling Yunzhi?

57
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:02,042
What's going on?

58
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,877
There's someone here
who would like to see the master.

59
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,969
His name is Zeng Jun.

60
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:09,609
Send him in, I'll go outside to greet him.

61
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:10,679
Yes.

62
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:24,571
Send for Master Zeng,
our master will greet him.

63
00:09:33,846 --> 00:09:34,971
Please.

64
00:09:37,247 --> 00:09:39,236
The inn's full, sorry.

65
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:46,635
Goodbye.

66
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:48,372
"Chang An Inn"

67
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,140
Sorry, there's a private function.

68
00:09:52,247 --> 00:09:54,735
We're all paying customers here,
how could you?

69
00:09:55,447 --> 00:09:57,345
They all have some backgrounds,

70
00:09:57,447 --> 00:10:00,311
I just worry about your inconvenience.

71
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:07,605
Sorry.

72
00:10:12,147 --> 00:10:13,737
This is not a good inn.

73
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,903
Ling Yunzhi is a rich man,

74
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,502
why don't we stay at his residence?

75
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:19,239
There aren't that many
martial arts experts here,

76
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:22,472
since we know that
the Masked Avengers are based here.

77
00:10:24,946 --> 00:10:28,242
I get it, you suspect Ling Yunzhi
to be the Chief.

78
00:10:33,746 --> 00:10:36,440
Watch it! Don't break my stuff.

79
00:10:37,913 --> 00:10:39,311
I didn't say that.

80
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,868
Welcome.

81
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:43,435
Qi Shanyun.

82
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,469
The Eight-armed Nazha.

83
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,045
You've made a name at such a young age.

84
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:03,204
Welcome to our small town!

85
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,570
But why would you

86
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,976
be staying at such a lowly inn?

87
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,705
Come stay at my place,
there's plenty of guest rooms.

88
00:11:11,813 --> 00:11:15,302
Brother Ling, did Zeng Jun tell you
why we're here?

89
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:21,105
Yes. But it's strange that
despite my family being here

90
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,610
for generations, I've never heard that

91
00:11:22,713 --> 00:11:24,804
the Masked Avengers are based here.

92
00:11:30,047 --> 00:11:32,808
They are very secretive and
come and go like ghosts.

93
00:11:32,913 --> 00:11:34,640
We need to take our time
in this investigation.

94
00:11:34,746 --> 00:11:35,837
You're from a prominent family,

95
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,707
I'm afraid it'd be a bother
if we stay with you.

96
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:39,938
I think we better put up in an inn.

97
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,774
Nonsense! If this gets out,

98
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,108
people will think of me
as a terrible host.

99
00:11:45,414 --> 00:11:47,471
Don't listen to Qi Shanyun, follow me.

100
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,504
We've already lost several men

101
00:11:50,613 --> 00:11:52,579
dealing with the Masked Avengers.

102
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,169
We must be extra careful.

103
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,609
We've all taken oaths before,

104
00:11:56,713 --> 00:11:58,906
no one would act alone.

105
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:02,736
Very well, I'm the host.

106
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:06,040
Maybe we could sit down and have a chat?

107
00:12:06,147 --> 00:12:07,578
Certainly.

108
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:11,040
The food in this inn is awful,

109
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,005
go home and get the kitchen to
prepare something good.

110
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:16,170
Yes.

111
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,012
Let's drink.

112
00:12:28,113 --> 00:12:29,544
Cheers.

113
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:35,601
How did you know that

114
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,907
the Masked Avengers are based here?

115
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:41,104
I've introduced them to you briefly, but

116
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:44,838
I'm not sure whether you can
remember so many of us.

117
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:48,571
You know of Loyang's Long Family
and Jizhou's Han Family?

118
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,203
Of course.

119
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:53,745
Although the eldest Master Long is dead,

120
00:12:53,846 --> 00:12:57,301
but his eldest son, Long Congfeng,

121
00:12:57,413 --> 00:13:00,244
has grown into a famous young man,
and his brothers

122
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:04,676
are well known as
the Four Greats of Long Family.

123
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,246
Old Master Han, the Whirlwind Blade,

124
00:13:07,347 --> 00:13:10,211
is also a famous expert.

125
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:12,906
These are two of the Long brothers.

126
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:16,241
Long Congyu, Long Congjiang.

127
00:13:28,047 --> 00:13:31,570
And Han Family's son,
Han Yanzhang "Little Whirlwind"

128
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,306
I'm sure they can tell you the details.

129
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,644
It happened about a month ago.

130
00:13:37,746 --> 00:13:39,905
My family and the Han family
had a wedding to plan.

131
00:13:40,013 --> 00:13:42,002
My eldest brother Congfang
and my fifth brother Conghai

132
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,908
escorted 4th sister Xianer
to be married to Yanzhang.

133
00:13:45,013 --> 00:13:47,410
They were besieged by
Masked Avengers outside the town.

134
00:14:03,247 --> 00:14:05,678
Help!

135
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:29,335
Eldest brother...

136
00:14:37,413 --> 00:14:39,743
Third brother Congjiang & I
were with Yanzhang in town,

137
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,244
about to greet the bridal party.

138
00:14:41,346 --> 00:14:44,779
As we rushed there,
eldest brother was about to die.

139
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,641
Eldest brother...

140
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:50,905
It's the Masked Avengers.

141
00:14:51,013 --> 00:14:56,002
They took Xianer and Conghai with them.

142
00:14:56,113 --> 00:14:59,273
Eldest brother...

143
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:02,439
And then the group of us

144
00:15:02,546 --> 00:15:05,512
went out and tried to investigate
in that area.

145
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,011
A friend, Zhang Cheng
found out of the Masked Avengers

146
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,601
being based in Jingyang Town.

147
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,468
Unfortunately he had sustained
serious injuries,

148
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,545
and died before he could tell us more.

149
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:22,706
You brought us the heated wine,

150
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,540
why are you still here?

151
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:38,041
Leave now, we've business to discuss here.

152
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,539
The cook is a bit strange,
not sure what he's up to.

153
00:15:53,946 --> 00:15:55,741
Come on, let's eat.

154
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,836
I'm sure he's up to something.

155
00:15:58,946 --> 00:15:59,877
Maybe not.

156
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,844
But it seems that he knows martial arts.

157
00:16:02,946 --> 00:16:04,639
Xiaoyang pushed him just now,

158
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,507
it looked as if he fell.

159
00:16:06,613 --> 00:16:08,442
In fact he pretended to fall,

160
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:10,172
he wasn't being pushed down.

161
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,336
If that's the case,

162
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:14,140
we must keep an eye on him.

163
00:16:16,546 --> 00:16:21,808
Strange indeed, he looks very familiar.

164
00:16:25,013 --> 00:16:27,138
Brother Ling, let me drink to you again.

165
00:16:30,846 --> 00:16:32,744
I can't drink anymore.

166
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:34,641
I think I should sleep here tonight.

167
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,611
Master, this isn't a place to sleep.

168
00:16:38,312 --> 00:16:41,278
I like to sleep wherever I please.
It's not your call.

169
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:04,003
Why do you think
Ling Yunzhi's staying here tonight?

170
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:09,411
He likes to be pampered,

171
00:17:09,513 --> 00:17:12,206
and is very particular
about his meals and lodgings.

172
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:14,870
Why would he be interested
to sleep in this dump?

173
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,412
And it didn't seem like he's drunk.

174
00:17:18,513 --> 00:17:20,411
Surely something's up.

175
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,805
Wang Zhenlin,
you're sleeping next door to him,

176
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,640
stay alert.

177
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,712
Watch out for
anything out of the ordinary.

178
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:46,506
Fang Ying,
since Ling Yunzhi's staying here,

179
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:48,670
sneak in his house and take a look.

180
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,541
See if you could find anything.

181
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,010
Write properly, pay more attention.

182
00:17:55,112 --> 00:17:56,101
Got it.

183
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,843
And now, turn the pages,

184
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:11,844
and repeat after me.

185
00:18:11,946 --> 00:18:17,742
Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li...

186
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:26,711
Zhou, Wu, Zheng, Wang;
Feng, Chen, Zhu, Wei;

187
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:33,609
Jiang, Shen, Han, Yang; Zhu, Qin, You, Xu

188
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,739
Why aren't you writing?

189
00:20:31,913 --> 00:20:32,469
Where are you going?

190
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:33,545
I'm thirsty, I want water.

191
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:35,077
Very well, I'll go with you.

192
00:21:01,546 --> 00:21:04,410
Get up! Why are you lying at the entrance?

193
00:21:14,813 --> 00:21:17,870
Impressive! No wonder Zeng Jun said
you know kung-fu.

194
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:19,945
Looks like you've taken some lessons.

195
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:22,903
But I'd really like to find out
how good you are.

196
00:21:28,046 --> 00:21:29,342
What are you two doing here?

197
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:32,241
Thirsty, just want some water.

198
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:34,312
Me too.

199
00:21:44,479 --> 00:21:47,377
I don't believe that he can fight.

200
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:56,673
What was that move
when you were dodging Xiaoyang?

201
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,439
I have no idea.

202
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:00,377
You are...

203
00:22:00,479 --> 00:22:02,138
The cook of the inn.

204
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:07,935
Sorry to disturb your sleep.

205
00:22:08,312 --> 00:22:09,471
It's better to be awake.

206
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:26,376
There's nothing strange
about the Ling residence.

207
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,377
I was attacked by the Chief.

208
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:31,343
Golden mask, golden trident,

209
00:22:31,446 --> 00:22:34,900
none of the Ling family members knew.

210
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:44,909
Go upstairs and check
whether Ling Yunzhi is asleep.

211
00:22:45,012 --> 00:22:47,570
Slowly, don't make a sound.

212
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,008
Checking on Ling Yunzhi?

213
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:21,777
What happened? What's going on?

214
00:23:23,112 --> 00:23:25,578
Shut up! It's my turn!

215
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,636
Stop!

216
00:24:52,779 --> 00:24:53,370
Thank you.

217
00:24:53,479 --> 00:24:55,104
I don't understand what you're saying.

218
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:07,545
See if you know any of them.

219
00:25:07,646 --> 00:25:08,634
Sure.

220
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:15,602
No...

221
00:25:17,646 --> 00:25:18,668
No

222
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:24,107
Fang Ying, Wang Zhenlin was killed.

223
00:25:25,513 --> 00:25:26,570
And where's Ling Yunzhi?

224
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:28,509
He's been sleeping there
the whole evening.

225
00:25:28,613 --> 00:25:31,408
Guess he's got nothing to do
with the Masked Avengers.

226
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,535
Take the bodies out.

227
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:57,175
The Masked Avengers attacked us
in the kitchen.

228
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,108
Zeng Jun and the others killed them.

229
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:00,576
Do you know this person?

230
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:05,573
No.

231
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,836
Please have a seat.

232
00:26:15,112 --> 00:26:18,737
Brother Ling, do you know who could be

233
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:20,708
involved with the Masked Avengers?

234
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,244
There's one in Jingyang Town.

235
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:25,574
His name is Fang Zuguang;
a very skilled chap.

236
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,702
But then, everyone knows of us as foes.

237
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:34,040
This might sound like
I'm trying to frame him.

238
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:37,203
Please, could you just tell us more.

239
00:26:37,312 --> 00:26:40,472
Fang Zuguang likes to help others
from time to time,

240
00:26:40,578 --> 00:26:43,976
but he does things according to his moods.

241
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,239
He has a lot of martial arts experts
working for him.

242
00:26:48,346 --> 00:26:53,142
And to prevent others from
finding out their base,

243
00:26:53,246 --> 00:26:55,643
it must be set in some big house.

244
00:26:55,745 --> 00:26:57,734
Other than my residence,

245
00:26:57,845 --> 00:27:00,368
the Fang Residence is the biggest here.

246
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,374
Fang Zuguang.

247
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:11,740
Master Fang...

248
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:21,401
Master Fang

249
00:28:22,578 --> 00:28:23,544
Please.

250
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:36,769
Master Fang. Welcome...

251
00:28:42,945 --> 00:28:44,309
Here's the wine.

252
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,005
Fang Zuguang has gone in.

253
00:29:18,112 --> 00:29:19,577
Going to the market?

254
00:29:20,212 --> 00:29:23,974
Yes. Don't run around like a
piglet awaiting slaughter.

255
00:29:25,012 --> 00:29:25,773
In order to find the butcher,

256
00:29:25,879 --> 00:29:27,811
the piglet must take its chances.

257
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:29,109
Not afraid to die?

258
00:29:29,212 --> 00:29:32,076
Looking for the butcher is risky.

259
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:37,978
Tell me how a piglet can find
the butcher.

260
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,336
Answer me.

261
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:44,537
I don't know, I'm like a piglet myself.

262
00:29:44,645 --> 00:29:47,237
The butcher looking for me,
and I searching the butcher.

263
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:50,305
I'm going to the market, wanna come along?

264
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:51,878
Certainly...

265
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:06,171
What are we cooking today?

266
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,676
Braised fish head,

267
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:11,337
a platter of appetizers, and this.

268
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,234
Light the fire.

269
00:30:13,346 --> 00:30:16,470
Me?

270
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:19,845
Aren't you a bit harsh on me?

271
00:30:19,945 --> 00:30:22,433
If I can, why can't you?

272
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:25,910
We see each other everyday,

273
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:28,240
I still don't know your name.

274
00:30:29,212 --> 00:30:30,871
Just consider me as a nobody.

275
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:32,410
I'm Zeng Jun.

276
00:30:37,612 --> 00:30:38,771
I don't know your background,

277
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,777
but I can tell you are a hot-blooded man.

278
00:30:41,879 --> 00:30:45,073
You think? I'm cold-blooded.

279
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:50,010
Please step aside
if you can't light the fire.

280
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,805
What's the fun to be a cook?

281
00:30:52,146 --> 00:30:54,475
Beware being burnt to death
without the fire being lit

282
00:31:00,645 --> 00:31:03,440
You're saying that
the Masked Avengers will kill us?

283
00:31:08,645 --> 00:31:11,736
Though I don't know
how to light a fire, I can cook.

284
00:31:13,445 --> 00:31:14,968
You want to be a chivalrous man?

285
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:20,571
Who doesn't?

286
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,668
True.

287
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:24,938
But don't get yourself killed
in the process.

288
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:27,777
Even so, it's better than trying to evade.

289
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:37,770
Why can't you leave me alone
like the rest of them?

290
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:40,277
I want to help you.

291
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:45,538
Very well, light the fire.

292
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:51,108
I don't believe you're cold-blooded.

293
00:31:51,212 --> 00:31:53,007
I think you don't believe that yourself.

294
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:55,441
Ling Yunzhi said you seem familiar.

295
00:31:55,545 --> 00:31:57,068
A man must be upright.

296
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,474
If you evade, you might as well be dead.

297
00:32:04,779 --> 00:32:08,302
Impressive! That would really hurt.

298
00:32:14,645 --> 00:32:16,975
It's too late, I saw that.

299
00:32:18,912 --> 00:32:20,377
What are you hiding from?

300
00:32:20,478 --> 00:32:21,705
Light the fire.

301
00:32:23,046 --> 00:32:24,671
Sure.

302
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:44,776
Don't cry, let me buy you a toy.

303
00:32:48,146 --> 00:32:49,043
One please.

304
00:32:52,979 --> 00:32:55,774
Don't cry, isn't this fun?

305
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:00,711
Take a look.

306
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:13,736
Xiaoyang, Yang Qingbiao.

307
00:33:27,012 --> 00:33:30,239
Hurry! Move aside.

308
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:53,373
Come on everyone! I made all these!

309
00:33:58,046 --> 00:34:00,978
What are you looking at? Eat up!

310
00:34:03,245 --> 00:34:04,404
Just the few of us?

311
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,671
Where's Xiaoyang and the rest?
Why aren't they back?

312
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:13,236
They're keeping an eye on
Fang Zuguang at the teahouse,

313
00:34:13,345 --> 00:34:15,675
Chen Shengkang and Yanzhang are outside.

314
00:34:15,779 --> 00:34:17,745
I guess Fang Zuguang hasn't left,

315
00:34:17,845 --> 00:34:19,470
hence neither could they.

316
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:22,408
Yang Qingbiao must be eating
with Brother Xu right now.

317
00:34:22,512 --> 00:34:23,773
So what?

318
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:24,810
Do you think any restaurant

319
00:34:24,912 --> 00:34:27,105
could make better dishes than me?

320
00:34:28,012 --> 00:34:30,603
Come on! Eat up!

321
00:34:30,712 --> 00:34:31,769
Eat up!

322
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,708
Come on! Eat up!

323
00:34:33,812 --> 00:34:36,937
Come on!

324
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,574
Yang Qingbiao is...

325
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,167
...unlucky.

326
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:45,973
Yang Qingbiao is really unlucky.

327
00:34:53,012 --> 00:34:54,841
They killed Yang Qingbiao,

328
00:34:54,945 --> 00:34:57,775
he was killed by a Chief
who used golden trident.

329
00:35:11,712 --> 00:35:13,439
What are you doing here? Get out!

330
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,540
Another piglet's been slaughtered
by the butcher.

331
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:17,508
What are you talking about?

332
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:22,807
Liang Rong, don't be mad.

333
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,104
What he just said,

334
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:25,837
wasn't what you think he meant.

335
00:35:25,945 --> 00:35:27,433
What does he mean then?

336
00:35:27,545 --> 00:35:29,340
Enough, come over.

337
00:35:34,378 --> 00:35:37,867
I don't trust him.

338
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:40,807
Fang Zuguang isn't the Chief.

339
00:35:40,912 --> 00:35:42,571
When Yang Qingbiao was killed,

340
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,838
we were in the teahouse.

341
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:46,206
Fang Zuguang isn't the Chief
and neither is Ling Yunzhi.

342
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:48,834
Then who is?

343
00:35:53,012 --> 00:35:54,034
Have you thought of something?

344
00:35:54,145 --> 00:35:55,543
Neither of them is,

345
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:57,907
and it could also be said
they could both be.

346
00:35:58,012 --> 00:36:00,910
We only know that they have a Chief,

347
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:02,534
but there could be more than one.

348
00:36:02,645 --> 00:36:03,576
We kept an eye on one,

349
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:05,770
while the other's free to kill.

350
00:36:05,879 --> 00:36:08,743
That's why Ling Yunzhi and Fang Zuguang,

351
00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:10,708
they both could be.

352
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:12,072
What are we waiting for?

353
00:36:12,845 --> 00:36:15,140
Let's invite both Ling Yunzhi
and Fang Zuguang,

354
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:16,302
and see what happens.

355
00:36:16,412 --> 00:36:17,435
Alright.

356
00:36:17,545 --> 00:36:20,602
Invite Fang Zuguang tomorrow
at Ling Yunzhi's home,

357
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:22,109
Zeng Jun's with me.

358
00:36:22,211 --> 00:36:24,973
The rest will keep an eye
outside the Ling Residence.

359
00:36:25,078 --> 00:36:27,067
If Fang Zuguang leaves,

360
00:36:27,178 --> 00:36:28,508
Chen Shengkang will follow him.

361
00:36:28,612 --> 00:36:29,543
Alright.

362
00:36:47,045 --> 00:36:49,477
We've been looking all over for you.

363
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:53,135
That's very smart of you to hide here.

364
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,143
But then, we could still find you.

365
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:57,143
What are you two talking about?

366
00:36:57,545 --> 00:36:59,306
You just came from a temple fair?

367
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:03,069
I didn't know there's one.

368
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:05,368
You can act.

369
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:08,467
Yes. Show him what he's hiding,

370
00:37:08,578 --> 00:37:10,476
and then he can't act any longer.

371
00:37:55,378 --> 00:37:57,207
You have something to say?

372
00:37:57,745 --> 00:37:58,971
Your turn.

373
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:01,010
Fine, my turn.

374
00:38:01,111 --> 00:38:03,703
Even if the piglet is hiding,

375
00:38:03,812 --> 00:38:06,004
the butcher would come looking.

376
00:38:06,645 --> 00:38:07,974
You saw them?

377
00:38:10,512 --> 00:38:11,739
What do you want?

378
00:38:11,845 --> 00:38:14,276
You're on our side,
only that you use a different plan.

379
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:15,968
You plan to infiltrate them?

380
00:38:16,078 --> 00:38:18,976
But the mask and the trident
is that of a Chief.

381
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,476
You can't handle the
whole organization by yourself.

382
00:38:21,578 --> 00:38:22,771
How about?

383
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:30,274
What keeps you from thinking that
I'm a Chief myself?

384
00:38:30,378 --> 00:38:32,003
I should slap you for saying that.

385
00:38:32,111 --> 00:38:35,202
I take you as a friend and
you treat yourself as an ass.

386
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:45,269
Sorry, maybe I was out of line.

387
00:38:45,378 --> 00:38:47,537
Maybe you don't want to mix with us.

388
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:50,275
Hold on.

389
00:38:53,278 --> 00:38:54,868
You've asked my name several times.

390
00:38:54,978 --> 00:38:58,775
Let me tell you now, my name is Gao Yao.

391
00:39:15,211 --> 00:39:16,199
Master Fang's here.

392
00:39:16,612 --> 00:39:17,975
You've the nerve to show up?

393
00:39:18,078 --> 00:39:20,203
Why not?

394
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:28,735
But I didn't invite you.

395
00:39:28,844 --> 00:39:31,367
I've two friends who'd like to see you.

396
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:33,671
Qi Shanyun.

397
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:34,802
Zeng Jun.

398
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:38,674
I've heard of you.
Must have been a tough journey here.

399
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:42,404
And I think you've followed me
on the streets before.

400
00:39:42,512 --> 00:39:44,478
As for Brother Qi,

401
00:39:50,245 --> 00:39:53,769
if you've any misunderstanding,
please say so.

402
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:55,469
We're here to investigate
the base of Masked Avengers.

403
00:39:57,412 --> 00:39:58,400
So I've heard.

404
00:39:58,512 --> 00:40:01,944
And you've already lost some men
because of it.

405
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:07,042
I don't know who's your source,

406
00:40:07,145 --> 00:40:09,906
so as to prompt you to
come looking for their base.

407
00:40:10,011 --> 00:40:13,273
If that's true,

408
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:16,810
I guess
only Master Ling would know about it.

409
00:40:16,911 --> 00:40:21,207
I honestly don't, but I guess you do.

410
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:24,611
Both of you are known for your good work,

411
00:40:24,712 --> 00:40:26,904
I'm sure you'll help to get rid of them.

412
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:29,034
Of course.

413
00:40:29,412 --> 00:40:31,469
Since I'm the host,

414
00:40:31,578 --> 00:40:35,374
I've prepared some wine,
let's talk this over.

415
00:40:38,512 --> 00:40:41,966
Come on.

416
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:36,574
You...

417
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:04,776
Chen Shengkang's dead.

418
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:28,206
He's got a golden mask in his hand,

419
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:29,901
he must have been killed by the Chief.

420
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:31,602
Before he died,

421
00:42:31,711 --> 00:42:34,041
he snatched the Chief's mask.

422
00:42:34,145 --> 00:42:36,736
In that case, he knew his identity.

423
00:42:37,711 --> 00:42:41,144
Too bad he couldn't tell us.

424
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:50,806
So the Chief is...

425
00:42:50,911 --> 00:42:52,138
I know who the Chief is.

426
00:42:52,245 --> 00:42:54,676
He's been close to us all this time!
It's him!

427
00:42:54,778 --> 00:42:56,801
That's nonsense!

428
00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:58,672
Let's go back first.

429
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,870
Liang Rong, don't be rash.

430
00:43:24,145 --> 00:43:25,042
Move aside.

431
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:27,077
I'm sure I can find something here.

432
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:32,068
Even so, what can you prove?

433
00:43:33,211 --> 00:43:35,074
Zeng Jun, what are you trying to say?

434
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:36,508
What's going on?

435
00:43:36,611 --> 00:43:37,236
Brother Qi,

436
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:40,572
I've found two strange items,

437
00:43:40,678 --> 00:43:42,508
he hid them away before.

438
00:43:42,611 --> 00:43:45,271
I've changed the hiding place
after I found them.

439
00:43:57,978 --> 00:43:59,239
These are the items.

440
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,606
I think the cook is the Chief.

441
00:44:09,711 --> 00:44:11,700
No, Gao Yao isn't the Chief.

442
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,936
He wants to get rid of
Masked Avengers as much as us!

443
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:14,874
He has the items

444
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:16,910
so that he could infiltrate their group.

445
00:44:17,878 --> 00:44:19,810
Zeng Jun, take a closer look.

446
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:23,002
This weapon is the same
which killed Chen Shengkang.

447
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:24,509
What's going on?

448
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,043
Why are you protecting him?

449
00:44:26,145 --> 00:44:27,372
My friend.

450
00:44:32,278 --> 00:44:34,437
The night when the Masked Avengers
raided the inn;

451
00:44:34,544 --> 00:44:35,306
If it wasn't for him,

452
00:44:35,412 --> 00:44:37,741
Yang Qingbiao, Chen Shengkang and I
would all be dead.

453
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:39,208
That's just your opinion.

454
00:44:39,311 --> 00:44:41,243
Now that Yang Qingbiao and
Chen Shengkang are dead,

455
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,776
who could prove that?

456
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:43,969
A Chief.

457
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:45,237
How could he be?

458
00:44:45,345 --> 00:44:48,175
Think about all the robberies
by the Masked Avengers,

459
00:44:48,278 --> 00:44:49,504
with all that money.

460
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:51,475
And the Chief is not going out
and having a good time,

461
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:53,839
instead he's working here as a cook?

462
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:55,240
I'm sure he is.

463
00:44:55,345 --> 00:44:56,867
We're still trying to find the suspect,

464
00:44:56,978 --> 00:44:58,807
but the Masked Avengers
keep killing our brothers.

465
00:44:58,911 --> 00:45:00,036
When Chen Shengkang died,

466
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:02,667
were you with Ling Yunzhi
and Fang Zuguang?

467
00:45:02,778 --> 00:45:04,744
Calm down everyone!

468
00:45:19,412 --> 00:45:20,968
Look! He's here!

469
00:46:00,477 --> 00:46:02,875
Brother Ling, what are you doing here?

470
00:46:02,978 --> 00:46:05,206
And how about you?

471
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,606
Checking on someone to see
if he's indeed an old buddy.

472
00:46:08,711 --> 00:46:12,109
If the person you're referring to
is a cook,

473
00:46:12,211 --> 00:46:15,643
I've met him before,
and he seemed like an old friend.

474
00:46:17,011 --> 00:46:17,942
Brother Fang, please.

475
00:46:18,045 --> 00:46:19,170
Brother Ling, please.

476
00:46:42,744 --> 00:46:43,869
Who would have thought?

477
00:46:43,978 --> 00:46:45,944
The person we've tried so hard to find,

478
00:46:46,045 --> 00:46:47,635
is right under our nose.

479
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:49,607
Life is full of surprises.

480
00:46:49,711 --> 00:46:52,768
My friend,
I can see that you're very skilled.

481
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:54,434
This is highly unusual.

482
00:46:54,544 --> 00:46:57,204
Are you somehow connected
to the Masked Avengers?

483
00:46:57,311 --> 00:47:01,538
Over the years they have committed
too many crimes,

484
00:47:01,644 --> 00:47:02,905
you should know
'what comes around goes around'.

485
00:47:03,011 --> 00:47:04,636
I am aware of that.

486
00:47:04,744 --> 00:47:07,471
A man will take his chances
and face the consequences.

487
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:10,509
If you're a member,
please show us the trident.

488
00:47:10,611 --> 00:47:11,770
I've sworn not to

489
00:47:11,878 --> 00:47:15,003
use the trident
unless on a Masked Avenger.

490
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:50,406
Brother Qi, why don't you fight?

491
00:48:06,078 --> 00:48:07,203
I think he has back up.

492
00:48:22,477 --> 00:48:23,966
Hide now! It's not a good time.

493
00:48:24,078 --> 00:48:25,668
They will understand sooner or later.

494
00:48:30,644 --> 00:48:32,133
Go! I await your return.

495
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:56,171
Brother Qi, you ask him.

496
00:48:56,277 --> 00:48:58,436
What does he mean by letting a Chief go?

497
00:48:58,544 --> 00:49:01,010
If he's a Chief, I'll fight him.

498
00:49:01,111 --> 00:49:02,269
That must be him.

499
00:49:03,178 --> 00:49:04,643
Brother Qi, do you believe me?

500
00:49:04,744 --> 00:49:06,505
Of course.

501
00:49:06,611 --> 00:49:09,736
And I believe that
no matter who Gao Yao is,

502
00:49:09,844 --> 00:49:11,400
he seems to be a good person.

503
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:12,568
Excellent.

504
00:49:12,678 --> 00:49:14,439
As long as you give him
a chance to explain

505
00:49:14,544 --> 00:49:16,170
I'll find Gao Yao back!

506
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:18,243
You know where he's headed?

507
00:49:18,611 --> 00:49:21,169
No, but I've promised him to wait here.

508
00:49:21,277 --> 00:49:23,869
I treat him as a friend, and so does he.

509
00:49:23,978 --> 00:49:27,206
He wouldn't take off just like this.

510
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:28,435
Very well.

511
00:50:50,778 --> 00:50:54,733
Who are you?
You're not permitted to come here.

512
00:50:54,844 --> 00:50:56,833
You can't disturb
the Zen lesson in process.

513
00:50:59,744 --> 00:51:01,005
Third Chief.

514
00:51:02,511 --> 00:51:05,500
Chief, now that we know
each other's identity,

515
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:07,736
we no longer require our masks.

516
00:51:07,844 --> 00:51:10,003
From now on, let's team up.

517
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,077
Sure.

518
00:51:40,011 --> 00:51:43,704
What? Your friend isn't back yet?

519
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,108
I've told you, he's a Chief.

520
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,335
He leads a team of criminals.

521
00:51:50,444 --> 00:51:52,637
You have gone nuts to treat him
as a friend!

522
00:51:52,744 --> 00:51:53,801
Shut up!

523
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:32,807
Have you thought of something?

524
00:52:32,911 --> 00:52:34,809
I suddenly realise that

525
00:52:34,911 --> 00:52:36,433
you've mastered
the skills of using a trident.

526
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:45,073
I'm a Deputy Chief,

527
00:52:45,177 --> 00:52:47,405
of course I would have mastered it.

528
00:52:47,511 --> 00:52:49,204
What are you kidding about?

529
00:52:49,310 --> 00:52:50,435
I'm not kidding.

530
00:52:51,244 --> 00:52:55,267
You! I've offended Brother Qi
and the rest.

531
00:52:55,377 --> 00:52:57,605
So I was wrong about you.

532
00:52:58,944 --> 00:53:00,807
You can't be!

533
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,103
I am!

534
00:53:07,177 --> 00:53:09,575
I was a Deputy Chief
of the Masked Avengers.

535
00:53:10,344 --> 00:53:13,310
Do you still remember
when you arrived at the inn?

536
00:53:13,411 --> 00:53:16,741
I heard Long Congyu talk of
his eldest brother's death

537
00:53:16,844 --> 00:53:21,105
and the kidnapping of
his younger siblings.

538
00:53:22,144 --> 00:53:24,474
I was there at the scene.

539
00:53:24,844 --> 00:53:28,037
The Masked Avengers are based
in a deserted temple.

540
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:39,743
Fifth brother...

541
00:53:53,611 --> 00:53:57,202
Fifth brother...

542
00:53:57,310 --> 00:54:00,708
Please don't cry, sister. We're tough.

543
00:54:01,577 --> 00:54:04,634
A young boy claiming to be tough.

544
00:54:14,277 --> 00:54:16,368
Fifth brother...

545
00:54:18,277 --> 00:54:21,471
Fifth brother...

546
00:54:21,577 --> 00:54:23,270
This girl...

547
00:54:23,377 --> 00:54:25,240
Should we reward this girl to our members?

548
00:54:25,344 --> 00:54:26,332
Good idea.

549
00:54:27,910 --> 00:54:29,069
Go.

550
00:54:29,177 --> 00:54:30,040
Wait.

551
00:54:32,077 --> 00:54:34,907
What is it? Is the Deputy Head interested?

552
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:38,438
We've killed many,

553
00:54:38,544 --> 00:54:40,941
that's because we've been given
large sums to do so.

554
00:54:41,044 --> 00:54:44,272
The dowry we've robbed
isn't much this time,

555
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:47,502
and we've killed
a famous swordsman Long Congfeng.

556
00:54:47,611 --> 00:54:50,906
And Long Conghai was just a kid.

557
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,670
How can we hurt a woman now?

558
00:54:53,778 --> 00:54:55,710
We kill anyone it takes,

559
00:54:55,811 --> 00:54:57,709
what's the big deal to hurt a woman?

560
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:00,603
Go.

561
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:15,307
Deputy Chief, where are you off to?

562
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:20,468
Stand still or I take you as a rebel.

563
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:27,035
Rebel? Alright. I quit now,

564
00:55:27,144 --> 00:55:28,973
and I'll no longer have
anything to do with you.

565
00:55:29,077 --> 00:55:31,236
Aren't you scared that we'll look for you?

566
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:34,071
We've always worn masks,

567
00:55:34,177 --> 00:55:35,143
and we don't know each other's identity.

568
00:55:35,244 --> 00:55:36,540
I'll use my way to hide,

569
00:55:36,644 --> 00:55:38,735
and you can use your way to find me.

570
00:55:53,778 --> 00:55:55,368
So you refused to associate with them,

571
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,340
you've left the organization.

572
00:55:57,444 --> 00:55:59,410
I was right about you after all.

573
00:56:05,778 --> 00:56:07,243
You've been hiding in the small inn.

574
00:56:07,344 --> 00:56:10,174
Yes. Because they would never expect that

575
00:56:10,277 --> 00:56:12,140
I'll have the nerve to
stay in Jingyang Town.

576
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,039
And being here,

577
00:56:14,144 --> 00:56:18,099
I can find out who's the Chief
and the Third Chief.

578
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,176
They are?

579
00:56:19,277 --> 00:56:20,766
The Chief is Ling Yunzhi.

580
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:22,776
The Third Chief is Fang Zuguang.

581
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:25,104
Just as I thought.

582
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,276
This isn't right!
When Chen Shengkang died,

583
00:56:28,377 --> 00:56:31,002
Ling Yunzhi and Fang Zuguang were with me.

584
00:56:31,110 --> 00:56:33,940
Chen Shengkang grabbed a golden mask
used by a Chief.

585
00:56:34,044 --> 00:56:37,101
That's right.
Within six months after I left,

586
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:39,676
there's a new Deputy Chief.

587
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:55,535
Are you the new Deputy Chief?

588
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:56,667
Yes, I am.

589
00:56:57,177 --> 00:56:58,404
Do you have the order?

590
00:56:58,511 --> 00:56:59,602
Yes.

591
00:57:02,644 --> 00:57:04,132
Who did you kill?

592
00:57:04,544 --> 00:57:05,873
Under the Chief's order, Cui Liang,

593
00:57:05,977 --> 00:57:08,875
the young master of
White Tiger Clan was killed.

594
00:57:08,977 --> 00:57:10,000
Please check.

595
00:57:24,244 --> 00:57:25,710
It's Cui Liang.

596
00:57:33,843 --> 00:57:38,901
A reward of 100 gold taels
for killing Cui Liang.

597
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:43,340
Half of it to the organization
and half to Deputy Chief.

598
00:57:49,577 --> 00:57:51,634
Thank you, Chief.

599
00:57:51,743 --> 00:57:54,766
You're the Deputy Chief now, have a seat.

600
00:58:12,511 --> 00:58:14,443
Deputy Chief.

601
00:58:14,544 --> 00:58:17,703
Twenty taels of gold
for everyone to split.

602
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,735
Who's the new Deputy?

603
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:43,404
I've no idea,
I tried but couldn't find out.

604
00:58:43,577 --> 00:58:46,475
Gao Yao, what do you plan to do now?

605
00:58:50,077 --> 00:58:51,634
Go afar.

606
00:58:56,344 --> 00:58:59,139
Stop hiding! Join us
against the Masked Avengers!

607
00:58:59,244 --> 00:59:00,267
Trust me.

608
00:59:00,377 --> 00:59:03,343
Your friends don't trust me at all.

609
00:59:08,677 --> 00:59:10,234
They will come around sooner or later.

610
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,737
You've uncovered the identities
of the Chief

611
00:59:13,843 --> 00:59:15,400
and Third Chief.

612
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:18,999
Go back and tell Qi Shanyun,
get more manpower.

613
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,406
You thought that the base

614
00:59:20,511 --> 00:59:22,477
must be in some big residence.

615
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:24,667
But in fact, it's in a deserted temple.

616
00:59:24,777 --> 00:59:26,766
All you have to do is wait,

617
00:59:26,877 --> 00:59:29,843
you can nab them all in one go
when they assemble.

618
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:39,033
You should head back.

619
00:59:42,643 --> 00:59:43,575
Gao Yao.

620
01:00:25,411 --> 01:00:26,434
Didn't see that coming?

621
01:00:26,544 --> 01:00:28,237
You thought I didn't notice,

622
01:00:28,344 --> 01:00:30,435
but I heard you.

623
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:34,499
So? You've changed your mind? I guess so.

624
01:00:44,344 --> 01:00:46,469
What are you doing?

625
01:00:58,344 --> 01:01:00,832
Very well! The three of you here!

626
01:01:00,943 --> 01:01:03,068
I deserve such attention!

627
01:01:03,643 --> 01:01:05,609
I'm so silly not to see it.

628
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:08,176
You don't dress the same as Gao Yao.

629
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:18,504
You're Fang Zuguang, the Third Chief.

630
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:44,067
I know who you are.

631
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:46,336
Ling Yunzhi, the Chief.

632
01:01:48,044 --> 01:01:51,010
That's right, and now you can die.

633
01:02:02,576 --> 01:02:04,167
The Deputy Chief is...

634
01:02:04,277 --> 01:02:06,334
Honestly, I don't know who you are.

635
01:02:12,411 --> 01:02:14,001
Now I know.

636
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:26,243
So it's really you! I was right.

637
01:03:35,843 --> 01:03:38,365
Looks like they've already found out

638
01:03:38,476 --> 01:03:40,533
our identities except for Liang Rong's.

639
01:03:40,643 --> 01:03:44,098
They know about us.

640
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:47,301
Brother Fang, please summon everyone,

641
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:50,808
Liang Rong could then
lure them to our base.

642
01:03:58,743 --> 01:04:02,267
It's my treat this time.

643
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:09,238
Stop pulling me!

644
01:04:09,343 --> 01:04:11,775
Forget it! Let's go!

645
01:04:18,044 --> 01:04:19,532
What's going on?

646
01:04:19,643 --> 01:04:22,109
The kid's almost dead.

647
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:27,536
We should report it.

648
01:04:27,643 --> 01:04:28,631
Stay out of it!

649
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:30,868
Can't you see the tridents on him?

650
01:04:30,977 --> 01:04:33,068
It's got pinned him on the tree.

651
01:04:33,177 --> 01:04:34,437
So scary!

652
01:04:48,376 --> 01:04:49,240
Zeng Jun.

653
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,038
Deputy Chief?

654
01:05:07,144 --> 01:05:10,042
Liang Rong.

655
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:13,935
"Chang Ann Inn"

656
01:05:17,843 --> 01:05:18,308
Add some water.

657
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:19,706
Thanks.

658
01:05:28,843 --> 01:05:30,968
Brother Qi, I think we should send someone

659
01:05:31,077 --> 01:05:33,066
to where Gao Yao was last night.

660
01:05:33,177 --> 01:05:34,108
Yes.

661
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:37,176
And we should send someone on the streets.

662
01:05:37,276 --> 01:05:40,538
But whenever our members went alone,

663
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:43,201
they were attacked.

664
01:05:43,576 --> 01:05:46,940
We must also send someone else
for back-up.

665
01:05:47,309 --> 01:05:48,297
Congyu,

666
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,439
you go with Yanzhang

667
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:53,203
to where Gao Yao was last night.

668
01:05:53,309 --> 01:05:55,969
The place where your brother was killed.

669
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,134
I know.

670
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:00,933
Weifang and Congjiang shall
stay on the streets.

671
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:01,941
Yes.

672
01:06:02,044 --> 01:06:03,976
Be careful, everyone.

673
01:06:09,843 --> 01:06:11,331
"Warrant"

674
01:07:12,176 --> 01:07:13,403
Hide!

675
01:07:32,376 --> 01:07:32,967
What would you like to buy?

676
01:07:33,077 --> 01:07:34,133
A mat.

677
01:07:50,843 --> 01:07:52,468
Zeng Jun is still not back.

678
01:07:52,576 --> 01:07:54,042
I'm worried.

679
01:07:54,143 --> 01:07:55,803
I don't think we can trust him;

680
01:07:56,143 --> 01:07:57,541
And he said that Chief's a good man,

681
01:07:57,643 --> 01:07:59,165
and he treats him as a friend.

682
01:07:59,276 --> 01:08:01,208
Liang Rong, Zeng Jun is our brother.

683
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:03,935
A brother? Then why does he take
a Chief as his friend?

684
01:08:04,044 --> 01:08:05,475
I think Zeng Jun...

685
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:17,933
Do you want to know where Zeng Jun is?

686
01:08:18,044 --> 01:08:20,100
That's him! He's the Chief.

687
01:08:25,543 --> 01:08:27,975
Brother Qi, Zeng Jun's your buddy.

688
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:30,668
You should be able to
recognise his outfit.

689
01:08:37,476 --> 01:08:38,567
It looked like he was hurt by a trident.

690
01:08:38,677 --> 01:08:39,700
Yes.

691
01:08:41,309 --> 01:08:43,037
Brother Qi, the murderer is here.

692
01:08:43,143 --> 01:08:44,632
Let's avenge for Brother Zeng.

693
01:08:45,276 --> 01:08:46,606
Wait for me to finish.

694
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:47,937
You've nothing more to say.

695
01:08:50,743 --> 01:08:53,039
Qi Shanyun, if you won't hear me out,

696
01:08:53,143 --> 01:08:55,041
all your friends
would have died for nothing.

697
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:57,131
Let him finish.

698
01:08:57,643 --> 01:09:00,200
He has a golden trident,
he's a Chief for sure.

699
01:09:00,309 --> 01:09:01,468
Zeng Jun and I said goodbye,

700
01:09:01,576 --> 01:09:03,508
three Chiefs appeared after I left.

701
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:05,041
The three attacked him.

702
01:09:05,143 --> 01:09:07,405
He fought his best, one against three.

703
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,271
And he's found out their identities.

704
01:09:09,376 --> 01:09:12,035
Why are you listening to his bullshit?

705
01:09:14,076 --> 01:09:16,440
Shut up and let him finish.

706
01:09:16,543 --> 01:09:17,440
I don't know why we should;

707
01:09:17,543 --> 01:09:18,770
After all, he did kill Zeng Jun

708
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,103
and is talking nonsense here.

709
01:09:20,209 --> 01:09:21,766
Let him finish.

710
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:26,702
I know who the Chief
and the Third Chief are.

711
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:28,139
Who?

712
01:09:28,243 --> 01:09:29,504
The Chief is Ling Yunzhi.

713
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:30,769
The Third Chief is Fang Zuguang.

714
01:09:30,877 --> 01:09:31,843
What about the Deputy Chief?

715
01:09:31,943 --> 01:09:33,033
It's him.

716
01:09:36,276 --> 01:09:39,140
You've said quite enough,

717
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:42,209
but who would believe you?

718
01:09:42,309 --> 01:09:43,673
You don't?

719
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:48,035
Brother Qi, you must not believe him.

720
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:51,075
Zeng Jun's dead, who could back you up?

721
01:09:51,176 --> 01:09:52,437
He can say anything he wants.

722
01:09:52,543 --> 01:09:54,270
I never said Zeng Jun's dead.

723
01:09:54,376 --> 01:09:56,308
Why are you so certain...

724
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:57,899
that he's dead?

725
01:09:58,009 --> 01:09:59,908
He got pierced by a trident,
of course he'd die.

726
01:10:00,009 --> 01:10:02,441
And how did you know that?

727
01:10:04,777 --> 01:10:12,767
Brother Zeng... please come here.

728
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:15,967
Earlier you said that
Liang Rong is the Deputy Chief,

729
01:10:21,943 --> 01:10:23,465
and he escaped.

730
01:10:23,576 --> 01:10:26,007
Now that the truth is revealed,
he has nowhere to go.

731
01:10:26,109 --> 01:10:27,302
He can't run anymore.

732
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:29,107
Now you will believe me.

733
01:10:30,243 --> 01:10:33,403
I had my suspicions
when he became restless earlier.

734
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:35,567
But it'd be impossible to prove this

735
01:10:35,677 --> 01:10:37,040
if Brother Zeng's dead.

736
01:10:38,510 --> 01:10:40,135
Zeng Jun is indeed dead.

737
01:10:40,243 --> 01:10:41,402
When I got there,

738
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:46,101
all he could utter was Liang Rong's name.

739
01:10:48,243 --> 01:10:51,732
If not for this,
Liang Rong wouldn't blow his cover.

740
01:11:08,243 --> 01:11:09,539
Zeng Jun?

741
01:11:09,643 --> 01:11:11,404
Brother Zeng's killed.

742
01:11:11,909 --> 01:11:13,569
At least we've a Masked Avenger
in our hands,

743
01:11:13,677 --> 01:11:15,870
we could ask him about the Chief.

744
01:11:34,743 --> 01:11:37,004
He killed himself.

745
01:11:39,543 --> 01:11:40,873
So there's no one alive.

746
01:11:40,976 --> 01:11:43,306
Don't worry, we've known

747
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:44,808
the identities of the Chiefs.

748
01:11:44,909 --> 01:11:48,433
Ling Yunahi, Fang Zuguang, and Liang Rong.

749
01:11:48,543 --> 01:11:49,634
Liang Rong too?

750
01:11:49,743 --> 01:11:51,641
He was holding this

751
01:11:51,743 --> 01:11:53,231
when we caught the masked avenger earlier.

752
01:11:56,343 --> 01:11:57,899
This is an order to assemble them

753
01:11:58,009 --> 01:12:00,840
to meet at the base.

754
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,465
The base is in a deserted temple,
I know where.

755
01:12:04,777 --> 01:12:08,231
I'm sure Liang Rong's there now.

756
01:12:08,343 --> 01:12:09,604
Let's go there!

757
01:12:09,710 --> 01:12:11,505
We can get rid of them all!

758
01:12:43,876 --> 01:12:44,672
Sister.

759
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:45,800
Xianer.

760
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:54,376
Sister.

761
01:12:54,809 --> 01:12:56,639
Xianer, what's wrong?

762
01:13:08,743 --> 01:13:10,901
Sister...

763
01:14:25,643 --> 01:14:28,165
Forget about tracking us down.

764
01:14:28,276 --> 01:14:32,140
From now on, the Long and
Han families no longer exist.

765
01:15:02,576 --> 01:15:04,871
Gao Yao has revealed our identities,

766
01:15:04,976 --> 01:15:07,306
he's now with Qi Shanyun and the lot.

767
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,932
Gao Yao knows this place,

768
01:15:09,043 --> 01:15:10,668
they'll get here any time.

769
01:15:10,776 --> 01:15:12,265
Let's go to the back hall.

770
01:15:12,376 --> 01:15:13,364
These two...

771
01:15:20,276 --> 01:15:21,798
Keep them alive.

772
01:15:21,909 --> 01:15:24,535
They can tell them that
we've gone to the back.

773
01:15:24,643 --> 01:15:28,370
As long as Qi Shanyun &
Gao Yao have gone there,

774
01:15:28,476 --> 01:15:30,499
they can't leave.

775
01:15:53,276 --> 01:15:56,504
Brother Yanzhang, Second brother.

776
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:12,033
They've gone towards the back.

777
01:16:12,143 --> 01:16:13,131
Second brother.

778
01:16:17,043 --> 01:16:18,134
Brother Yanzhang.

779
01:16:22,076 --> 01:16:23,735
The door is behind the Buddha statue.

780
01:16:25,009 --> 01:16:26,100
Brother Yanzhang,

781
01:16:32,576 --> 01:16:33,973
There's a trap besides the door.

782
01:16:47,043 --> 01:16:48,941
Go in! Hurry!
