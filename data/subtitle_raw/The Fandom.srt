♪

2
00:00:11,606 --> 00:00:14,439
(eerie whistling)

3
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:21,491
- [Rod] There's this weird
thing that humans do.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,712
We take animals and we put
our words into their mouths

5
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,493
to talk back to us, usually about us.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,110
It's a very strange thing,

7
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:37,963
but we've done it for centuries.

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,730
We learned to read from
anthropomorphic animals.

9
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,960
We learn right from wrong
from anthropomorphic animals.

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,660
But most people don't notice it.

11
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:01,593
Furry fans are the people
who notice that we do this,

12
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,850
and think that there's something

13
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,653
really special about that.

14
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:14,190
- Well, like the dictionary
definition you get

15
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,530
is furry is a community of people

16
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,500
that enjoy anthropomorphic art, right?

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,263
- [Nonstoppup] I feel like
it's way more than that.

18
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,503
It's a social space that is largely queer,

19
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,500
and gravitates around,
using art as the vehicle

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,333
to explore identity.

21
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,500
- I sucked at drawing people,

22
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,510
so I would draw animals and everything.

23
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,550
- I sort of anthropomorphized my own dog

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,473
in a lot of my drawings, stuff like that.

25
00:01:48,473 --> 00:01:52,910
- I was a part of a Lion
King archive online,

26
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,530
and everybody role plays as lions.

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,240
And I remember just thinking,
guys, the lions are great,

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,550
but what if we were wolves?

29
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,810
And they're like, ew, furry.

30
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,860
And I was like, furry? (laughs)

31
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,913
- I had my first word to get
to this feeling that I had.

32
00:02:11,193 --> 00:02:13,053
- Yes, yeah, I did your shirt.

33
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,920
I was initially into cosplay.

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,080
I cosplayed a lot of anime characters.

35
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,300
- I'm not alone.

36
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,900
There are other people out
there that are into this.

37
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,160
I didn't come out fully, 'cause
furry was taboo back then.

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,120
It's something weird, something odd.

39
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,400
It doesn't help that
media never really had

40
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,183
a positive point of view to begin with.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,890
- But I'm always grateful

42
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,120
for the friends that I've made

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,410
and the people that
I've met along the way.

44
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,290
It's just a fundamental part of who I am.

45
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,660
- So I'm not super familiar

46
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,850
with the history of the fandom.

47
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:51,630
I know, I think it originated

48
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,760
out of a sci-fi convention in the 80s,

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,803
and I want to say probably California.

50
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:13,951
(cups clattering)

51
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:22,580
(wind chime clinks)

52
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,970
- I was already known as
the science fiction geek

53
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,670
of the family.

54
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:31,160
The movie geek and the Disney geek.

55
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,783
I've been all of these
things since I was a kid.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,360
- I've been interested
in science fiction fandom

57
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,270
since the 1970s, when I went to

58
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,823
my first Star Trek convention.

59
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,943
I was a Navy brat.

60
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,690
Our family would go to the movie theater

61
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,510
at the Air Navy base in
St. Louis and watch films.

62
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,980
- [Rod] One of the first times
I've ever been to a theater,

63
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,330
my dad hated them.

64
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,060
He much preferred drive-ins,

65
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,400
but somehow we talked him into going

66
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,647
to a sit down theater to see "Robin Hood."

67
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:21,020
- [Mark] And I would fuss
and cry and squirm always,

68
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,967
except in the movie "Bambi."

69
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,320
- [Rod] I was immediately hooked.

70
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,603
I was into that cartoon.

71
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:42,608
- [Mark] I just loved animation.

72
00:04:42,608 --> 00:04:45,093
What it looked like and
also how it was done.

73
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,830
- [Rod] I'm into it in a way
that my school friends aren't.

74
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,370
I'm into it in a way
that my parents aren't.

75
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,803
So what do I do?

76
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,840
I was looking for fandom.

77
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,350
A bunch of people getting together

78
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,213
and geeking out with
each other about media.

79
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,050
- [Mark] We traveled across the country

80
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,563
and ended up moving to California in 1958.

81
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:17,480
- [Rod] I live in Southern
California, close to Hollywood,

82
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,540
the media capital of the world,

83
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,265
or at least it was at the time.

84
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,548
- [Director] Background places, please.

85
00:05:22,548 --> 00:05:25,820
- This is lovely.
- Oh, it's lovely.

86
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,684
- [Man] Turn around, let's see your back.

87
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:31,780
- [Camerawoman] You had a nice
pose, want to try it again?

88
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,610
- [Rod] LosCon 1980.

89
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,930
The local Southern California
science fiction convention.

90
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:39,220
That was the first convention
that I'd ever been to

91
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,527
that had an art show.

92
00:05:40,527 --> 00:05:43,010
And it was beautiful.

93
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,490
A lot of it was princesses
in flowing gowns,

94
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:50,430
star fields that you'd see
on the side of someone's van.

95
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:52,340
And a lot of it was
just absolutely amazing.

96
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,190
But then here are these pictures

97
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:00,310
of these semi-anthropomorphic
weasel characters

98
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,883
with antennas like bugs.

99
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,740
A friend of mine said,
Rodney, you gotta see these,

100
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,270
'cause they knew I wouldn't shut up

101
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,820
about my enjoyment of mustelid characters.

102
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,223
In school, I was considered
very weird for that.

103
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,723
So I asked them at the art
show, who does this art?

104
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,630
- [Mark] I had a video
room at LosCon seven

105
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,783
showing some anime, some
science fiction TV shows.

106
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,990
And this tall guy comes up and goes--

107
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,463
- Why do your pine martens have antennas?

108
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,210
- Oh my, this person recognizes

109
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,460
the kind of animals I'm drawing.

110
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,800
Most people thought they were cats.

111
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,033
And I said, well, sit down
and I'll explain it to you.

112
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,690
We loved Japanese animation

113
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,773
and nobody knew about it
except for the few shows

114
00:07:32,299 --> 00:07:35,770
By 1977, myself and four other people,

115
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,280
some of whom were
animators in the business,

116
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,830
actually TV animators.

117
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,250
We decided more people
should see this stuff

118
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:43,233
and started a club.

119
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,720
And it was the first anime club.

120
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,623
- The very first anime
fan club in America.

121
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,820
- A lot of the people
that came to the meetings

122
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,793
were also into animal characters.

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,680
Which is why the mascot of the club

124
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,438
became one of my Skiltaire,

125
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,363
which are sort of an alien
mammal based on weasels.

126
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,930
Rodney would come to the screenings

127
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,800
and we'd hang out and talk.

128
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,853
And we saw each other more
and more and more after that.

129
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,380
Here were two people

130
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,270
who came from very different backgrounds,

131
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,290
but we were paralleling each other

132
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:48,290
amazingly on interests and passions.

133
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,370
Movies, animation, novels, comics.

134
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:58,183
And a few years later, we
decided to become a couple.

135
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,650
- Rod and Mark are effectively,

136
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,500
the grandparents in the furry fandom.

137
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,500
I consider them the parents
of the furry fandom,

138
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,130
but I've also been in the furry fandom

139
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:13,723
for 20 years at this point.

140
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:21,150
The Prancing Skiltaire
household is like a museum

141
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:25,770
and library of furry things.

142
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,733
They had figurines all over the place.

143
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,760
They have bookcases and
bookshelves of furry comics,

144
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,763
of anime comics, of sci-fi.

145
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,790
- [Rod] So this is San
Diego Comic Con one year.

146
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,320
This is Don Bluth and Douglas Adams.

147
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,950
Me.

148
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,090
- [Rod] Remember they had

149
00:09:50,009 --> 00:09:51,733
the live action muppet?
- The live action muppet show.

150
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,810
- [Rod] There was lots and lots and lots

151
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,543
of science fiction conventions.

152
00:10:04,661 --> 00:10:06,411
- [Attendee] Ah yeah!

153
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,393
- We saw the birth of the comic book shop.

154
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,710
- In the 70s, it was a time when

155
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,360
the Comics Code was
still heavily enforced,

156
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,330
and so comic books all
had to be black and white,

157
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,470
good and evil, superhero comics basically.

158
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:24,070
But there were these groups of artists

159
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,620
who were just chomping at the
bit to do something different,

160
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,560
to do something, not superheroes,

161
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,910
to do something Funny Animal.

162
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,510
- [Rod] Funny Animal does not
mean animals that are funny.

163
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,920
It means animals that are in the funnies.

164
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,780
- A lot of people think Funny Animal

165
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,000
and think that it all has to go to kids,

166
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,040
but a lot of it was being
consumed by adults as well,

167
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,283
especially in the underground comic scene.

168
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:58,760
- Their sense of mischief,
their sense of uninhibitedness.

169
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,320
I was sort of in a family where

170
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,210
I don't think there
was a lot of elbow room

171
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,950
for my exuberance, my imagination.

172
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,060
And I think I projected a lot
of that into these stories,

173
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,380
into these characters.

174
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,880
And I think a good deal of identification

175
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,023
developed from that.

176
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,320
- [Mark] Funny Animal comics
used to be very popular

177
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
before superheroes took off.

178
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,040
- And they had their own fandom.

179
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,030
It was very spread and
had a lot of difficulty

180
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,813
talking to each other in
the old pre-internet days.

181
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:31,703
- [Mark] Now they've
been lost to obscurity.

182
00:11:41,896 --> 00:11:45,833
- The fandom started...pretty much-

183
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,010
Old folk tend to disagree

184
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:50,070
on where exactly it began,

185
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,210
but the commonly accepted starting point

186
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,260
was a painting done by
the artist Steve Gallacci.

187
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,820
He had created a character,
a furry character,

188
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,750
a pilot in a futuristic spaceship.

189
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,660
This piece was hanging up in an art show

190
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,180
at an east coast science
fiction convention.

191
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,461
Now what you have to understand is

192
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:13,300
that hadn't been done before.

193
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,160
A furry, an anthropomorphic character,

194
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,150
was limited to a coyote
hitting the bottom of a cliff,

195
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,940
standing up dusting himself off

196
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,440
and going to the Acme catalog.

197
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,040
- [Summercat] He also
published one of the very first

198
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,167
furry anthology comics, "Albedo."

199
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,330
Steve had a whole world

200
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,430
about these anthropomorphic
animals in outer space

201
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,440
and their politics, and war
between different groups.

202
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,063
It really caught people's imaginations.

203
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,770
- It was from discussion of his work

204
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,030
that led to the very first furry party,

205
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,860
directly led to the very
first furry party, actually.

206
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,080
Cause they moved to discussion

207
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,810
from in front of his art panel

208
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:56,060
to a private room to
continue the discussion.

209
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,480
- It started out as gatherings of people

210
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,663
in room parties at science
fiction conventions.

211
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:07,231
(people laughing)

212
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,902
- [Joe] His fans would
show up and he discuss

213
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:11,348
this universe he'd created.

214
00:13:11,348 --> 00:13:12,493
- And that was the beginning.

215
00:13:12,493 --> 00:13:15,063
That was around 1980 or there about.

216
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,640
- [Joe] These room parties somehow

217
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,810
got the name of furry parties.

218
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,410
- The term 'furry' had got
around and stuck enough

219
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,500
that when we had another party

220
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,740
at Westercon 1986 in San Diego,

221
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:36,003
we decided to call it a furry party.

222
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,450
All of these artists were amazed

223
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,010
that there were other people out there

224
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:44,510
drawing quote, unquote, Funny Animals

225
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,760
in the way that they did.

226
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,430
- Someone would walk into our party,

227
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,360
pull out a sketchbook and say,

228
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,840
I was the only one I
thought that was drawing

229
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,013
this kind of stuff.

230
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,250
And that just kept
happening again and again.

231
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:07,010
- They had this same revelation as I did.

232
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,560
I'm not the only one.

233
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,960
I always thought I was weird.

234
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,240
I always thought no one
else would understand.

235
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,657
And here are people who are just like me.

236
00:14:18,994 --> 00:14:22,077
- (TV plays cartoon)

237
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:26,390
- It was like a quest to find more people

238
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,493
who like the same thing we liked.

239
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,170
And it became the most
important thing in our lives.

240
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,880
- I wanted to jump up on
the Empire State Building

241
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,730
and singing an aria about it.

242
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:44,423
I thought we had stumbled
across something just so cool.

243
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,023
Well, this is a classic Merlino.

244
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,900
This is the AvantGarden
Gallery in downtown Santa Ana.

245
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,200
It's part of their arts district.

246
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,870
Mark and I have been hosting

247
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,300
what we call the art of furry fandom,

248
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,760
where we gather furry artists together

249
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,720
and have them put their stuff on display

250
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,170
along with all of this
quote, unquote regular art

251
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,610
- Here was our art show
and our sponsor lounge,

252
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,770
couple of panel rooms here,
and a mini fursuit lounge.

253
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,527
And then here was our game room.

254
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:37,920
Hi, I'm Bubbles, I'm 25.

255
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,670
I'm the convention chair for

256
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,370
five different furry conventions,

257
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,533
including DenFur here in Denver, Colorado.

258
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,710
The hotel will give us this whole space

259
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,313
and we choose how we use it.

260
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,660
A little meet-and-greet area.

261
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,860
Some board-gaming and then
our big, main events room.

262
00:16:01,471 --> 00:16:04,388
(crowd chattering)

263
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,770
We have had hotels that are like,

264
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:29,770
so I looked up this stuff
and what the heck is this?

265
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,220
I mean, DenFur is like

266
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,903
a celebration of the anthropomorphic arts.

267
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,540
Well, I found furry probably, oh,

268
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,280
probably junior high-ish.

269
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,110
I didn't know what furry was yet.

270
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,700
That was back in the days
of Neopets on the internet.

271
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,650
I found all those message boards,

272
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,980
and I'm like, these are my people.

273
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,830
I guess I'm here.

274
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,750
My parents, they always thought it was

275
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,670
some weird kinky thing that like,

276
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,760
what is my daughter doing?

277
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,810
The fandom growing up was kind of a hobby,

278
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,120
especially working as a medic.

279
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,800
It was a side thing that I could do

280
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,293
and enjoy outside of work.

281
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,260
Now I run conventions.

282
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,680
I mean, my life is the fandom,

283
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,193
and I don't know where I
would be now without it.

284
00:17:23,434 --> 00:17:26,351
(crowd chattering)

285
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,490
- [Mark] We had the creators,
the people that made art.

286
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,410
They were fans of comic strips.

287
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,410
They were fans of comic books

288
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,410
and they were all aiming
to be in that business.

289
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,530
- Reed Waller started an
APA-zine called "Vootie."

290
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,610
It had Funny Animals in it,

291
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:18,623
but it was more of an
underground influence.

292
00:18:18,623 --> 00:18:22,210
- APA, A-P-A, amateur press association.

293
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,230
- All the members of this APA-zine

294
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:26,720
would make photocopies of their artwork

295
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,020
and send it into the editor,

296
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,220
who would compile the
entire book together,

297
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,030
and then send a copy
out to all the members.

298
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,840
- And then you would get back,

299
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,130
here's my work and 25 or 30 other works.

300
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,630
- This is how a lot of people

301
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,510
over a large geographical area
got a chance to get feedback

302
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,060
from other artists, authors, and creators.

303
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,150
- There was literally this giant culture

304
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,670
of people who were talking to each other

305
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,620
by writing into the letters columns

306
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,800
of their favorite magazines.

307
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,053
It was like the internet in slow motion.

308
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,050
We were a very strange fandom.

309
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,040
We didn't fully grasp how
strange we were going in,

310
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:14,600
but we were not a fandom of a property,

311
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,790
nor were we a fandom of a genre.

312
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,480
Other fandoms would look at
us and get extremely confused.

313
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,563
What are you about?

314
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,303
WHO are you about?

315
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,830
All of those specificities don't matter.

316
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:34,200
It's the overarching:
animals-doing-things-

317
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,890
that-animals-don't-do, thing,

318
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:39,070
that binds this all together.

319
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:42,263
Beyond that, it can be anything.

320
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,390
- Probably the earliest
furry work I would talk about

321
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,770
is a Omaha the Cat Dancer,

322
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,860
which exists because Taral
Wayne who was fairly influential

323
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,277
in the early furry fandom
wrote a letter to "Vootie."

324
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:12,018
(crowd laughs)

325
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,880
- In response, Kate Worley and Reed Waller

326
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,773
came up with Omaha the cat dancer,

327
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,860
which is about a exotic
pole-dancing feline

328
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,060
and her boyfriend and
sometimes girlfriend.

329
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,333
It gets a complicated storyline sometimes.

330
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,160
It was story with drama,

331
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,900
it was a story with realistic action,

332
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,773
with character motivations.

333
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:43,080
Omaha was widely acclaimed

334
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,050
as a great pro-feminist comic as well

335
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:49,780
because it showed a female main character

336
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:52,060
in control of her own destiny,

337
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,227
and she didn't let society
decide what she wanted.

338
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,730
- We had all quietly discovered

339
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,730
that part of what brought
us to furry characters,

340
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,010
anthropomorphic characters,

341
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,140
was that we thought they could be sexy.

342
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,020
It seemed kind of obvious

343
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,740
when you saw some of these characters

344
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,320
and how they were designed

345
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,053
that they were intended to be sexy.

346
00:21:44,897 --> 00:21:47,660
(crowd cheers)

347
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,550
We felt we were just kind of

348
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,653
jumping on a big existing bandwagon.

349
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,220
The very first conventions I ever went to,

350
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,630
there were erotic
material of every fandom.

351
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,520
So of course, furry is full of sexuality

352
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,940
because furry is full of human beings

353
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,483
who are alive and thinking and feeling.

354
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,370
- [Mark] Ken Sample quite often would draw

355
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:34,233
this little cougar guy that
looked an awful lot like Ken.

356
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,983
We started calling that
character Ken Cougar.

357
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,620
We thought, hey, we should
have our own character too

358
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,173
that's actually us.

359
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,200
This was a big shift in the fandom.

360
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,200
We went from fans of animal
people to being animal people.

361
00:22:55,772 --> 00:22:58,951
♪

362
00:23:11,013 --> 00:23:14,523
- [Mark] This created an
explosion in art demand.

363
00:23:15,498 --> 00:23:18,415
(crowd chattering)

364
00:23:28,346 --> 00:23:33,013
- A fursona is someone's
character that represents them.

365
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,750
That may be how they see themselves.

366
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,980
It may be an aspirational character,

367
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,623
what they wish they were
or would like to become.

368
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,220
As an artist, it involves kind of

369
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,410
getting inside their head and figuring out

370
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:51,053
what is it that their fursona is saying?

371
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:56,920
Who is this person,

372
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,070
and what part of this human
is this furry character,

373
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:02,210
this fursona that you're designing?

374
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,910
When you can figure that
out and you show them

375
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,340
the final piece of art and they're like,

376
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,650
oh my gosh, that's perfect.

377
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,810
That's just like the
greatest thing in the world.

378
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:09,700
- Because a lot of people,

379
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,860
their furry character is
the better version of them.

380
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,480
This would be me if I
didn't have these problems

381
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,980
or these things, this is the best of me.

382
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,340
Cause everyone likes to think of animals

383
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:24,300
as being more pure and more
innocent and stuff like that,

384
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,340
'cause humans can do
some pretty dark things.

385
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,480
Granted, so do animals in the real world.

386
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,770
But we're not getting into
that, this is fantasy.

387
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,000
At least that's how I
always interpreted it.

388
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,030
That, and I think some people just thought

389
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,470
certain animals are cute.

390
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,913
- [Mark] Everybody wanted
pictures of their fursonas.

391
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:45,400
- [Rod] We started getting
together discussion groups.

392
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,253
What is your fursona?

393
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:53,690
- My earliest character was a kangaroo

394
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:56,916
named White Death because I was 13

395
00:24:56,916 --> 00:24:58,093
and I was super edgy.

396
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,930
- I chose a husky.

397
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,130
They were always my favorite dog,

398
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:06,990
and the personality wise
of a husky is basically me.

399
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,860
- I really like border collies
cause they're super smart,

400
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,860
and then I was like, but I need
to be ferocious like a wolf.

401
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,370
It is a border Collie wolf character.

402
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:22,250
His name was Kiguel, and
I had stolen the name

403
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,140
from an exchange student
that was at my school.

404
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:29,590
- I think people join furry
because of how encouraging

405
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,020
it is of exploring yourself,
understanding yourself

406
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,383
and expressing it.

407
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,420
- I've been drawing for
as long as I can remember.

408
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,020
I just picked it up as a
kid and didn't really stop.

409
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:01,303
I'd say I identify a lot with birds.

410
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm pretty quiet, and a
little bit shy or flighty.

411
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,400
I deal with social anxiety
and things like that.

412
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,590
I feel like I have one
foot in the furry fandom

413
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,070
and one foot in fantasy illustration.

414
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,480
There's a humanness that
you can impart to animals

415
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,640
or dragons or anything like that,

416
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,400
where there's that ability to
relate to what you're seeing,

417
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,890
even though what you're
seeing is fantastical.

418
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,440
I think that's really powerful.

419
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,010
I started doing conventions

420
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,823
to go and sell my work and show it.

421
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,540
I love it a lot more than just doing

422
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,160
like a mainstream comic convention

423
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,130
where it's all people celebrating

424
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,060
other intellectual properties

425
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,968
that are technically corporate.

426
00:26:53,968 --> 00:26:55,737
- [Attendee] I can't wait to do that talk

427
00:26:55,737 --> 00:26:57,870
with you tonight at 10:00 PM.

428
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:58,810
- One of the things I really love

429
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:02,050
about the fandom is
how many people find it

430
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,443
to be their path out of their shell.

431
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,210
- I started looking at all
the different suits and stuff

432
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:36,840
on Google search and they
just looked so unique

433
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,753
and just fascinated me.

434
00:27:39,728 --> 00:27:41,650
And I was like, I can do that.

435
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:42,483
I really wanna to do that.

436
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:46,250
And this is another creative
outlet that I can use.

437
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,710
And I wanted to make my
own character come to life

438
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,403
and be one of those fursuits.

439
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,963
I remember wearing my Luna
suit for the first time.

440
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,060
I ran into so many people

441
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,880
that wanted to take pictures with me.

442
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,280
And it was just really
exciting to like go around

443
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,356
and have fun in fursuit with
other people in fursuit.

444
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:07,630
- [Attendee] Ta-da!

445
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,307
- You can look at their character

446
00:28:09,307 --> 00:28:11,260
and learn things about
them in that very moment.

447
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,070
Like what their species choice is,

448
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,560
what sort of colors they're
using, what their name is.

449
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,150
That's all broadcasting a lot of things

450
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,810
that they want you to know about them.

451
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,160
And they might not even realize

452
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,463
what they're sending out subconsciously.

453
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,110
- Usually when I go to make a suit,

454
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,260
everything from gender to height

455
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,230
plays a role in creating
these characters for people.

456
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,500
And it's actually really
fun to help them explore

457
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:36,417
this whole new character
that they're creating.

458
00:28:37,443 --> 00:28:40,416
- [Cameraman] I think you're
in...I think you're in focus.

459
00:28:41,433 --> 00:28:44,160
- We had been going to BayCon,

460
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,290
and the anime fans were
taking over the convention.

461
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,910
The people running the convention

462
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,520
kind of politely said could you guys maybe

463
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,823
get your own convention because

464
00:28:55,823 --> 00:28:59,133
this is science fiction and
it's becoming all anime.

465
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,710
Rodney and I said, gee.

466
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,343
Maybe we could have a furry
convention just for furries.

467
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,950
So we started looking around
for a hotel local to us.

468
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,130
We weren't coming in there
with a corporate credit card

469
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,430
laying it down and say
this pays for everything.

470
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,220
If I signed the contract with the hotel,

471
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,240
I was liable to pay the hotel.

472
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,040
- I will admit I was young and
had kind of stars in my eyes.

473
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,950
I think we had a crew of like, five,

474
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,440
counting Mark and myself
for running everything.

475
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,210
- We'd been tossing names around.

476
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:40,080
And I had the idea, how about conference

477
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,113
except put a U of an E?

478
00:29:43,203 --> 00:29:44,875
ConFurence.

479
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,940
That's the name we picked.

480
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,760
We numbered the first convention 'zero'.

481
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,510
- Because we weren't certain
it was going to work.

482
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,220
So we said to ourselves, let's get crazy.

483
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,500
If we're going to put
on our own conventions,

484
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,093
let's try and do some things differently.

485
00:30:03,093 --> 00:30:05,843
(crowd cheering)

486
00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:13,580
One of the big things
that you will always find

487
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,330
in the history of science
fiction conventions

488
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,153
is the Saturday night masquerade.

489
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,093
- [Mark] It was the big event.

490
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,320
They weren't professionally
lit in any way, shape, or form.

491
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,940
All of us myopic fans with
their glasses could see

492
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,420
these glowing blobs
sauntering down the stage.

493
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,563
- Yeah, I guess that looks pretty.

494
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,400
- We thought it'd be great

495
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,470
if people could actually see the costumes.

496
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,030
Maybe even close up.

497
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,310
- Is this a little better?

498
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,143
Is this is a little better?

499
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,226
- Yeah.
- All right, okay.

500
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,141
Okay, we'll begin with

501
00:30:49,141 --> 00:30:50,616
the first.

502
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,366
(audience claps)

503
00:30:59,865 --> 00:31:02,615
(audience claps)

504
00:31:10,153 --> 00:31:12,923
Back then, art show was the biggest thing.

505
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,270
The art shows were always popular

506
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,710
and always made a lot of
money for the artists.

507
00:31:20,477 --> 00:31:23,227
(crowd chatters)

508
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:35,470
- We wanted to make furry
conventions smart and fun.

509
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,740
You wanted to come to learn stuff,

510
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,120
you could learn stuff.

511
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,920
If you wanted to come
to hang and be friends,

512
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,420
you could hang and be friends.

513
00:31:45,493 --> 00:31:48,243
(crowd chatters)

514
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,430
- January of '91, a friend of mine and I

515
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:56,870
drove 44 hours straight
from Tampa to SoCal

516
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:00,623
to ConFurence 2 in Anaheim.

517
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,890
It was a completely new experience.

518
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,130
My first trip out of the time zone.

519
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,770
Seeing hills for the first time,

520
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,313
then mountains for the
first time, and then snow.

521
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:17,830
Just a completely new thing,

522
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,060
throwing me completely out of my element.

523
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,617
Just sheltered shy college
kid, and next thing you know,

524
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:25,783
I'm in California amongst
several hundred furries.

525
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,340
These comic artists that
I'd seen in fanzines

526
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,140
and black and white comics,

527
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,690
they're right there in front of me.

528
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,460
And they're just, they're just people.

529
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,730
I was learning art myself
and drawing from time to time

530
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,563
and next thing you know,

531
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:43,480
I'm a writing for the first six issues

532
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,880
of a magazine called "Yarf!"

533
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,000
- There's been some
footage floating around

534
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,760
that's just adorable.

535
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,310
Terrible 80s hair, the 80s fashion.

536
00:32:55,310 --> 00:33:00,310
And it was very clear that
these people were having fun.

537
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:02,512
- [Panelist] Shop around
for your material.

538
00:33:02,512 --> 00:33:04,630
There are places out
there that will sell you,

539
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,733
charge you a fortune.

540
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:10,380
- They've found a place to
start exploring who they were

541
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,730
at a time and a place that

542
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:13,480
they never had been able to before.

543
00:33:15,176 --> 00:33:17,630
It was very inclusive and very welcoming

544
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,330
and became sex-positive.

545
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:23,760
Not that it was about sex,
but that when sex happened,

546
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,820
it was generally viewed favorably.

547
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,840
It wasn't dirty, wasn't wrong.

548
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,370
It was just sex.

549
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,743
And people have sex and that's fine.

550
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:38,040
- [Announcer] It's the
Rod O'Reilly master mix

551
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,133
at ConFurence Zero.

552
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:45,090
- We were fully prepared for
it to fall flat on its face

553
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,761
and cost us a bunch of money.

554
00:33:46,761 --> 00:33:47,710
And then say, well, that was a great idea.

555
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,917
Let's try something else.

556
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,084
But it worked.

557
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,760
- [Mark] It gave me a
feeling of accomplishment.

558
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,070
- We were onto something and we said,

559
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,203
let's take this football and run with it.

560
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:03,603
And we did.

561
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:45,060
- Can you test it, see if it sounds okay?

562
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,560
The con chair is always
the one in the spotlight.

563
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,160
People think we're the only
one making the decision.

564
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,960
This whole team of 60 to 100 people

565
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,130
put in months and months of
work to put on this show.

566
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,730
We can't run it with five people.

567
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,513
It wouldn't happen, there's no way.

568
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,023
- Boiler to Truffle.

569
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,420
- The thing that I didn't know was

570
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,930
how many small moving parts there are.

571
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,260
What time things open,
what time things close,

572
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,600
when things finally get locked down.

573
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,550
And how many people it takes
to put on something like this.

574
00:35:22,403 --> 00:35:24,920
(crew chatters)

575
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,430
- Usually set up starts right
after the last one ended.

576
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,610
We start putting things in place.

577
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,010
We started listening to feedback.

578
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,820
We started approving things.

579
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,783
It's a very, very complex machine.

580
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,637
- This is A1 corgi to A1...uh,

581
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:41,537
whatever your species is, Bubbles.

582
00:35:41,537 --> 00:35:44,240
There's a ton of different departments.

583
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,440
We have a business
director, events director,

584
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,500
operations director, marketing,
and public relations.

585
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,150
Theming, our HR managers.

586
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,233
IT and AV work, so all the
sound and lighting that you see.

587
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,440
- [Boiler] Things like dealer's den,

588
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,310
which is a vendor space,

589
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,743
requires hand-choosing the dealers.

590
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:10,023
And we go through 400
applications every single year.

591
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,870
- There's only two
female convention chairs

592
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,530
in the entire fandom.

593
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:22,010
And we have one and we're proud of that.

594
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,450
- I graduated as an EMT
and from high school

595
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,560
at the same time and worked my butt off

596
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,130
to get to paramedic
school as soon as I could.

597
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,570
The president of that program
sat me down in an office

598
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,320
and said, look, you're
going to be the only woman

599
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,153
in this class.

600
00:36:41,153 --> 00:36:42,620
I think you should leave.

601
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,100
Just being able to overcome
that in that profession,

602
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,150
also coming to furry has
made a big difference

603
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,260
'cause in the convention leadership world,

604
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,610
there's not a lot of women.

605
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,083
It is still extremely male dominated.

606
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,920
A lot of people in the 9-1-1
first responder profession

607
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,040
hurt their back.

608
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,360
And that's unfortunately
what happened to me.

609
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:08,360
I wasn't allowed to do that job anymore.

610
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,010
I do miss medicine,

611
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,603
but I get a lot of the same
gratification out of this.

612
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:30,205
- Okay, yeah, so there's
the con store stuff...

613
00:37:30,205 --> 00:37:31,636
so I can get the GoH...

614
00:37:31,636 --> 00:37:34,550
(radio muffles)

615
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,210
- The computer, the network,

616
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,200
the mass communication revolution

617
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,313
is what made furry fandom take off.

618
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,243
A whole lot of people who
are furries are in IT.

619
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,940
- [Rod] But it was the realm
of the military and colleges

620
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,830
that were the only
people who knew about it.

621
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,680
Eventually the college peoples went home

622
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,980
and took a lot of the
computer stuff with them.

623
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:02,980
- And then along came ARPANET,
FidoNet, bulletin boards,

624
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,743
the proto internet.

625
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,890
A bulletin board service.

626
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,060
You had to dial in to this central network

627
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,590
and you could post text, pictures.

628
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:18,030
The pictures was the painful part

629
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,840
because it would take about
30 minutes to download it.

630
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,540
And you would see the cursor
rendering across the screen,

631
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,020
every line of pixels.

632
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,530
- It was only a week until
you got a reply to your post

633
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:29,450
instead of a month.

634
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:31,530
Hey, life improves.

635
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:32,960
- People today take it for granted.

636
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,470
Back then, this was new.

637
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,870
This was unheard of.

638
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:37,880
This was Star Trek stuff.

639
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,330
- It gave people a chance

640
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,733
to do role play as their characters.

641
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,910
- When I was just coming out of college

642
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,240
and I was starting to work,

643
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,580
the internet was a very small place.

644
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,090
We think of it as this
big thing of global data,

645
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:58,440
but really, there wasn't as much out there

646
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,020
as people think there was,

647
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:01,410
and there weren't the browsers.

648
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,690
So we were using things
like Gopher and Mosaic

649
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:04,980
and all kinds of weird technology

650
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,920
that doesn't exist anymore.

651
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,610
- [Rod] A bunch of
people would get together

652
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:09,890
on a computer system,

653
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,120
form characters and go
on an adventure together.

654
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,680
They started calling these things

655
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,193
multi-user dungeons, MUDs.

656
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,110
It would say you are now in a room

657
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:26,520
that is this big, it's colored
red, it's made of brick,

658
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,160
and there is a dragon sitting there

659
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,280
that's going to eat your face.

660
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,210
- Other gathering started
that were entirely social.

661
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,920
They didn't want to
continue using the word MUD

662
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,280
because that still had
that dungeon connotation.

663
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,020
So they started calling them MUCKs.

664
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,510
- With the online communities,

665
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:46,400
particularly Furry MUCK
that started in 1990,

666
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,549
people were getting to know each other

667
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:50,870
and they would go to
conventions to meet each other.

668
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,273
- [Joe Strike] Excuse
me, are you THE Karno?

669
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:54,106
- Yes.

670
00:39:54,106 --> 00:39:55,360
- [Joe Strike] Hi, I'm THE Joe Strike.

671
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,340
- Hey, hiya, Joe.

672
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,790
- [Joe Strike] Oh yeah,
shake right there you go.

673
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,764
- I'm Mutie on Furry MUCK.

674
00:40:00,764 --> 00:40:04,264
This is Chirik, who also is on furry MUCK.

675
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,020
- And it became more
about meeting each other

676
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,550
and having this sense of community

677
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,570
beyond just people
centered around creators.

678
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,300
That's how I first found that there was

679
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,240
an organized furry fandom.

680
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,850
The community was, was
my solace, my salvation.

681
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,590
I was not very happy where I was.

682
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,960
The South side of Chicago at the time.

683
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,250
I spent a very, very long year there.

684
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,490
- [Cameraman] There we go, we got furries.

685
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:34,880
- And somebody mentioned

686
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,313
that there was a convention coming up

687
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:39,630
in Southern California called ConFurence.

688
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:41,440
Maybe you should go.

689
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,660
I said, I'm a postdoc at this
point, I don't have any money.

690
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,410
I called my dear and sainted mother.

691
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:50,790
Kids, never lie to your mom.

692
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,300
I told my mom the truth.

693
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,720
I'd like to go to a
conference in California,

694
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,573
but the professor won't pay for it.

695
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,943
That's a true statement.

696
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:03,393
So she sent me the money
to go to the conference.

697
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,010
And that was my first furry convention.

698
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,710
Now, I had been going to
science fiction conventions

699
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,760
for 10 years.

700
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,180
I've been volunteering at them.

701
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,660
I was a convention goer.

702
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:21,240
but this was the first time

703
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:24,210
that it was a convention that was entirely

704
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,183
of interest to me.

705
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,610
And started going to furry conventions

706
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,993
every year after that.

707
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,480
- Uncle Kage.

708
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,340
- Uncle Kage.

709
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,550
- Uncle Kage slash Sam Conway.

710
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,100
- He's very charismatic.

711
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,900
- He's very funny.

712
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,170
- He had this sort of mad
scientist kind of persona,

713
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:45,003
- [Joe Strike] So you're gonna create,

714
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:45,836
you're gonna create real furries?

715
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:46,669
- I am, as a matter of fact.

716
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:47,720
- [Joe Strike] And how
are you gonna do that?

717
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,700
- Well, it's quite simple.

718
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,360
You see the a, you take the,

719
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,510
Oh yeah.

720
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:55,555
I was sitting in the lobby,

721
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:57,860
and I was telling somebody a story.

722
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,350
It's in my nature

723
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,360
- As Mary Shelley said,

724
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,190
if you make the creature
a gigantic statue,

725
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,570
you have a much easier time

726
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,130
in dealing with the parts, you see.

727
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,190
- And they simply said,

728
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,023
would you come back next year

729
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,090
and do that as an event?

730
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:11,923
What?

731
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:13,860
Complain about my job?

732
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,693
And they said, yeah.

733
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:15,800
I said, oh, I can do that, sure.

734
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,480
So I stood up in the lobby

735
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,810
and complained about my job for an hour.

736
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,640
- [Mark] Well, he was
kind of doing standup

737
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,560
that was slice of life.

738
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,210
People loved his stories.

739
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,250
- He was already getting a
reputation for his performances.

740
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:32,290
And we were just thrilled
to have him at our show.

741
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:36,685
And that was 25 or so years ago.

742
00:42:36,685 --> 00:42:39,280
And people still fly me all over the world

743
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,097
to get up on stage and talk.

744
00:42:41,097 --> 00:42:42,100
That's all I do.

745
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,213
I don't understand it.

746
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:45,380
I just do it and they
keep inviting me back,

747
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,130
so I must be doing something right.

748
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,960
- After Furry MUCK,

749
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,013
almost all the furries
were college students.

750
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,093
This tripled our attendance.

751
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,930
Since we had all of the
role players coming in,

752
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:07,010
all the college students
coming into the fandom,

753
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:10,703
the gender of the content began to shift.

754
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,960
You had a lot more males,

755
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,423
you had a lot more lesbian
couples and gay couples.

756
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,300
- People don't realize it.

757
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,280
But back in the 60s and 70s,

758
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,377
there wasn't that much of a gay community.

759
00:43:26,377 --> 00:43:29,430
- Where could you go for companionship?

760
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,860
Some place where you had an equal chance

761
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:35,010
of getting your teeth kicked
in or getting arrested.

762
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:38,170
- [Rod] Right about the time
that furry fandom was hitting

763
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:41,063
was right about the time
that the AIDS crisis hit.

764
00:43:42,388 --> 00:43:43,830
♪

765
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,739
(crowd chattering fades)

766
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:56,453
- I know people who
lost dozens of friends.

767
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:01,500
An awful lot of people had
to come out of the closet

768
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,823
and get active for their own survival.

769
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:09,940
There was in fact, an LGBT
contingent in the furries.

770
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,973
We're going to celebrate
both of those at once.

771
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,860
- I still remember how I felt
when I joined the fandom,

772
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,730
like when I was like a teenager

773
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,320
and I had no idea if I was queer or not.

774
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,467
And I thought I was really
scared to talk about it.

775
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:25,820
And I couldn't tell my friends.

776
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,373
- High school was rough.

777
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,193
High school was rough.

778
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:36,103
I was pretty socially isolated,
I was nerdy, I was bullied.

779
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,720
- The community around me at the time

780
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,883
was not queer friendly,
or even art friendly.

781
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,080
- Doing art's really vulnerable.

782
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,550
Like if you put something on the page,

783
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,993
then you probably did that for a reason.

784
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,740
About midway through college,

785
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,010
I started questioning my gender

786
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,960
and eventually transitioned.

787
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,130
And that was a very
powerful time of my life,

788
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,020
where I got to really re-sort my identity

789
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:17,783
as this purpose-driven person.

790
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,370
- When I started to transition,

791
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:26,430
I actually explored the
identity first with my character

792
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,760
to see, I guess, if it felt right

793
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,500
to become more masculine.

794
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,080
it was no longer Luna.

795
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,560
It was now the masculine Nate.

796
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,470
And it's really helped me explore

797
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,860
what parts of myself I wanted to be

798
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:43,690
as more trans masculine versus, you know,

799
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:46,509
the meek female. I used to be.

800
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:48,970
A safe place to explore the transition

801
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:51,243
without transitioning myself first.

802
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:10,983
Trans experiences are
just human experiences.

803
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,653
Ultimately, furry is also
about human experiences.

804
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,220
- Once I discovered the fandom,

805
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:19,080
I could chat with people online.

806
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,970
I could express my creativity.

807
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,290
I could make friends.

808
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,320
- Well, I can actually talk about

809
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:27,210
being queer without being worried

810
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,853
that people make fun of me.

811
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,670
- What better place is there

812
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:33,310
to put yourself out there and say,

813
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:35,310
hey, this is how, I'd like
to be seen or treated.

814
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:37,050
And people will meet you on your own terms

815
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:40,342
in a way that you just
don't get anywhere else.

But it was always about this thing.

833
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,630
It was not about us.

834
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,053
We never wanted to be celebrities.

835
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:28,790
So they were very, very few fursuiters.

836
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,690
There was only, I think, maybe one or two

839
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,860
People would just paint their bodies.

840
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:36,693

You can make your own mascot.

855
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,090
to be the largest convention in its day,

856
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:26,300
over a thousand people,

857
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,000
which was huge for the time.

858
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,240
But then there was negative
publicity about it.

859

- [Mark] We did have some
incidents at conventions

864
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,490
where there were people
getting completely drunk

865
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:49,303
coming out into the convention
and causing trouble.

866
00:48:50,990 --> 00:48:53,890
Or in some cases getting
stoned out of their mind

867
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,890
and having to be taken off the property.

868
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:02,480
In the very early days,

869
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,850
a furry convention was,
an unintentional pun,

870
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:08,600
a rather wild and untamed unfair.

871
00:49:10,386 --> 00:49:12,010
- [Crowd Member] Yeah!

872
00:49:12,010 --> 00:49:15,680
- There was not a lot of
attention paid to public decorum,

873
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,260
and people are out there to have fun.

874
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,840
They were letting themselves go.

875
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,093
Let's just be crazy.

876
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,250
That's fun and that's fine,

877
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,810
if you keep in mind that
you're still in a public venue.

878

- [Attendee] Oh my god,

881
00:49:39,153 --> 00:49:41,736
it's the psychedelic Cousin Itt!

882
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:47,828
- [Announcer] The bidding starts at $20.

883
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:56,128
(vacuum buzzing)

884
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:59,058
- Well, let's see now.

885
00:49:59,058 --> 00:50:01,763
Should I talk about the
semen in the elevator?

886
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:04,730
No, I don't know if
there's any truth to that.

887
00:50:04,730 --> 00:50:05,750
I think there were people

888
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:09,800
who wanted to give the
furs a bad reputation,

889
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,810
and I think a lot of this
misinformation was spread.

890
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,420
But there might've been people

891
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,593
who felt a little too liberated.

892
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,790
- This caused us to have to do something

893
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:23,170
we didn't think was necessary.

894
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:27,583
We had to put rules of
conduct in our program book.

895
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,520
And we were criticized.

896
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,940
Why didn't you have rules of conduct

897
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,140
from the very beginning?

898
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,830
Because we didn't think
people were that stupid.

899
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,210
- [Director] Okay, Here we go.

900
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,673
- And when we had 200, 300,
400 people, we'd have problems.

901
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,930
Their twist on it was yeah,

902
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,060
Mark and Rodney allow that
kind of stuff at conventions.

903
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:54,880
- I remember when I was
working at Disney television

904
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,530
in the mid 90s.

905
00:50:56,530 --> 00:50:59,260
The executives at Disney
and at the other studios

906
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,050
knew about furries,

907
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,320
but they did not particularly
like the furries.

908
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,890
- Some furry artists have been turned away

909
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,910
because of the people
that are interviewing

910
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:09,840
that heard about these furry conventions.

911
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,970
- And interestingly, it wasn't

912
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,500
just because of the adult material.

913
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,360
It was also because they saw people

914
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,940
trading art back and forth freely.

915
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,410
And they did not like the idea

916
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:21,233
of property being freely
exchanged like that.

917
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:26,840
It was kind of a professional hazard

918
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:29,740
to let anyone know that you were involved

919
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,853
with the furry fandom.

920
00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:38,240
I had snuck away to go to
ConFurence for the weekend.

921
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,990
And two of my coworkers had
apparently shadowed the con

922
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:42,430
and seen me there.

923
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:43,610
As soon as I came into work,

924
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:45,436
they popped in my
cubicle and started going

925
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,667
furry, furry.

926
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:48,690
And I was like, oh my god.

927
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:50,530
I mean, they've been there themselves,

928
00:51:50,530 --> 00:51:52,350
so what could they say?

929
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,830
- [Cameraman] You guys here
for a convention of your own?

930
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:54,780
- Yeah.

931
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,030
- Computers?
- Marketing.

932
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:58,000
- [Cameraman] Whoa, even better.

933
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,390
- There was a large fandom
out here in California,

934
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,310
And there was also one back east,

935
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:05,820
kind of around New York.

936
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:08,070
- There had been an attempt to start up

937
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:09,580
an east coast furry convention,

938
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:12,110
'cause in the United
States, there was ConFurence

939
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:14,970
in Southern California, and that was it.

940
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,827
So in 1997, they started Albany Anthrocon.

941
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:22,050
I went because it was only four hours away

942
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:22,883
from Philadelphia.

943
00:52:22,883 --> 00:52:27,030
I could drive there instead
of flying across the country.

944
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:30,030
It was obviously a first
year con, kind of cute.

945
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:31,970
As I said, I had been volunteering

946
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:34,293
at science fiction conventions for years.

947
00:52:35,943 --> 00:52:38,310
And I was approached by one
of their committee members

948
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:40,910
who said, would you be our
guest of honor next year?

949
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:43,380
As the convention was coming up,

950
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:46,460
they had an email list for staff members.

951
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:50,360
A longstanding problem that I have is

952
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,520
I have a tendency to stick my nose in

953
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,183
whether it's wanted or not.

954
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,893
Things were coming across the mailing list

955
00:52:58,893 --> 00:53:00,097
and I'm going, hmm.

956
00:53:00,097 --> 00:53:02,400
And I would hesitantly type out

957
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,100
are you guys really sure
you want to do that?

958
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,517
You see Philcon tried this in, in 1984,

959
00:53:08,517 --> 00:53:11,560
and here, here, this, this list
of terrible things happened

960
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,590
and they swore high and low
they'd never do that again.

961
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:17,630
If you do this, that would
get around those problems.

962
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,040
Then they started asking my advice.

963
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,400
Well, how would you run this?

964
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,440
What would you do here?

965
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,990
How should we do the following?

966
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:27,840
They're honest questions,
so I answered honestly.

967
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:31,930
As the convention date was approaching,

968
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,860
there was a concern over the finances.

969
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,780
The chairman of the convention realized

970
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,950
that we are probably going to
completely lose our shirts.

971
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,500
We're going to have to shut this down.

972
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,430
Some of the staff members
came to me and said,

973
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:46,160
would you take over?

974
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,730
And I said, this is all kind
of happening awful fast, folks.

975
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,230
First off, I'm your guest of honor.

976
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:55,380
It looks kind of bad if I'm
also your chairman that year.

977
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,370
Okay, I'm willing to do it
because I want to help out.

978
00:53:58,370 --> 00:53:59,670
It's a good little convention.

979
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,733
You guys are really gung ho.

980
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:04,930
I'm happy to do it.

981
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:07,940
But it's gonna have to
be done differently.

982
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:10,170
You can't run it like
a bunch of college kids

983
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,760
having a party anymore.

984
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,790
If you want this to succeed
and have another year,

985
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,950
you're going to have to
run it as a business.

986
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:19,440
- [Cameraman] Tell us all
about Albany Anthrocon.

987
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,650
- Albany Anthrocon no longer exists.

988
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:22,780
- [Cameraman] It's now become?

989
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,810
- It's simply become Anthrocon,
the Furry Revolution.

990
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:29,210
We moved to the place that it all began.

991
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,950
The Hilton Valley Forge.

992
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:33,100
That's where the Declaration
of Independence was signed.

993
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,120
- Actually in the Hilton?
- In the Hilton.

994
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:37,936
- Signed in the Hilton?
- Signed in the Hilton.

995
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:39,080
- Will you turn that off already?

996
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,430
So these people don't know.

997
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:45,700
- Finally, in 1999, I attended

998
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:48,547
my very first furry convention,
which was Anthrocon.

999
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,040
That was one of the first major things

1000
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,603
I'd ever traveled to by myself.

1001
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:59,750
There were probably all of 30
events for the entire weekend.

1002
00:54:59,750 --> 00:55:01,573
But for me, that was a lot to do.

1003
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:04,630
And this guy just came down.

1004
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,200
He said, you look troubled
my friend, what's wrong?

1005
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,300
And I was like, well, I
just don't know what to

1006
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,343
make of all this.

1007
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:14,607
He put his arm around me and he said,

1008
00:55:14,607 --> 00:55:17,043
I want you to take a
look around the lobby.

1009
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:19,250
This is a moment you will remember

1010
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,550
for the rest of your life.

1011
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,843
- [Cameraman] He's doing it again.

1012
00:55:29,856 --> 00:55:32,220
(fan whirring)

1013
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,060
- And that was the moment
that I really realized

1014
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:37,740
I found a group of people
that I not only related to,

1015
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,510
but they made me feel good about myself.

1016
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,893
My personality had a place in the world.

1017
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,373
And the person that told
me that was Uncle Kage.

1018
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,110
- I got us a great hotel, it's perfect.

1019
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:00,140
We can be there forever

1020
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,520
because it's got more space
than we could ever possibly use.

1021
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:05,863
First year, bam, full.

1022
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:10,300
The next year we filled it
and two hotels down the road,

1023
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,593
We're going to need bigger space.

1024
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:19,060
I looked around in Philadelphia,
got the problem solved.

1025
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,010
The Adam's Mark has gotten more space

1026
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:23,083
than we could ever possibly need.

1027
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,633
Bam, full that very first year.

1028
00:56:27,586 --> 00:56:30,253
- 1,457 furries are in the room.

1029
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,493
- That was 1,457 in case
you didn't hear that.

1030
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,903
How many of us are there?

1031
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:43,030
When I was negotiating with Pittsburgh,

1032
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,990
I said, okay guys, it's perfect.

1033
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,070
We got more space there,

1034
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:49,003
and they said, shhhh, stop, don't say it.

1035
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,680
I'm still not allowed to say that phrase

1036
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,433
in regards to this city.

1037
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,030
It just got more space
than we ever possibly need.

1038
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,330
- Every convention has a hook.

1039
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:18,370
The hook for Anthrocon
is Pittsburgh itself.

1040
00:57:18,370 --> 00:57:19,550
It's the city.

1041
00:57:19,550 --> 00:57:22,420
The downtown area is vibrant and alive,

1042
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:25,220
and people are coming down
to watch the fursuit parade.

1043
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,660
We were recently told that Anthrocon

1044
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,240
is the third most valuable convention

1045
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,957
to the city of Pittsburgh itself.

1046
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,810
We have become a Pittsburgh institution.

1047
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,780
We're not just an event that happens.

1048
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,310
We are now part of the city's art scene.

1049
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:58,920
I don't think any other
convention anywhere

1050
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:00,370
has that sort of distinction.

1051
00:58:01,606 --> 00:58:04,273
(drums banging)

1052
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:19,480
- [Bubbles] I hate going on stage.

1053
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:21,083
I get stage-fright hardcore.

1054
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,980
And people are like, you're the con chair.

1055
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:25,410
You have to be extroverted.

1056
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,520
You have to be willing to talk to anybody

1057
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,580
and talk about anything.

1058
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,413
And I'm not.

1059
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,113
The suit definitely helps with that.

1060
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:42,720
I love being in a costume
and being able to act

1061
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,130
like something else,
'cause in high school,

1062
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,330
I was the school mascot.

1063
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:52,843
I'm more open and comfortable with myself.

1064
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,750
- Since I was like three years old,

1065
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:03,210
I was trying to take a feather duster

1066
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:04,430
and put it in my shorts.

1067
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:05,940
And then I have a tail.

1068
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,250
If you found a mask with feathers on it,

1069
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:10,640
possibilities were endless.

1070
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,290
So I was just trying to
make the perfect costume.

1071
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:15,120
And I found furries where

1072
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,320
we're all trying to get
the perfect costume.

1073
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,440
I had just gotten out of high school

1074
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,100
and I was starting to go to college,

1075
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,293
and I'm making a fursuit for some reason,

1076
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,660
I called a friend up and I was like,

1077
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:30,170
take me to PetSmart.

1078
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,303
I need to buy a collar in my costume.

1079
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,630
As we're driving back
home, there's this carwash.

1080
00:59:39,630 --> 00:59:41,470
And we just see this guy hopping around,

1081
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:44,120
struggling to get people
to come to the carwash.

1082
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,440
And I was like, he needs my help.

1083
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:49,590
I jumped in, I was doing jumping jacks

1084
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,370
and just helping to get a
bunch of people to pull over.

1085
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,163
And it was a success.

1086
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,300
People were like, where did you get that?

1087
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,810
And then when they'd find out I made it,

1088
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:02,380
they were like, can you make me one?

1089
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:05,743
And I was like, oh, well, I don't know.

1090
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,680
- I was obsessed with "The Lion King,"

1091
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,930
obsessed with pretty
much any animal movie.

1092
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,620
So I built my first suit at 17

1093
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,943
and I wore it for Halloween
at my high school.

1094
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,150
I went to college, got my degree

1095
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:25,740
in something completely unrelated

1096
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:27,740
and was just doing it on the side.

1097
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,660
And then it just kind of
accidentally became a business.

1098
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:32,323
And now I'm doing this full time.

1099
01:00:35,009 --> 01:00:37,780
- I would see the suits
being built and I'm like,

1100
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:38,613
I want to do that.

1101
01:00:38,613 --> 01:00:40,230
I could get involved.

1102
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,680
And I didn't really feel
very much technology

1103
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,030
was really being used in
building these things.

1104
01:00:46,358 --> 01:00:47,191
It was a challenge for me.

1105
01:00:47,191 --> 01:00:49,353
I wanted to figure out
how to do it my way.

1106
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:10,300
- My whole life, I struggled
with anxiety and depression,

1107
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,390
and a few years ago I was
diagnosed with bipolar as well.

1108
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,380
It's really hard and
it just tears you down,

1109
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,370
and I would come home
from work everyday crying.

1110
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:20,990
Nowadays, I feel like
I've done something good.

1111
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,720
I'm creating something
for someone to enjoy.

1112
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,903
I'm much more stable mentally,
and it feels really good.

1113
01:01:29,998 --> 01:01:33,390
- I had worked really
hard to have a nice house,

1114
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,410
a nice car, typical American dream,

1115
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:37,900
but I found it was really empty.

1116
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,700
And I found that it
was, this is, you know,

1117
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,210
it was not fulfilling
at the end of the day.

1118
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,920
And I've been having
more fun in doing this

1119
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:48,393
than I think I've ever had with
anything in my entire life.

1120
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:54,600
- [Lucky Coyote] I teamed up with Scuff,

1121
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,160
'cause Scuff was starting to build

1122
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:57,733
pieces and parts on his own.

1123
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,910
- Not only do you want
a fursuit to look good,

1124
01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:02,720
it needs to feel good.

1125
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,720
Every fur suit we build is custom,

1126
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,200
but that's your fursuit.

1127
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,923
It should feel like your
fursuit when you put it on.

1128
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,380
- I think we've made over 600 fursuits.

1129
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:17,719
I've kind of lost track.

1130
01:02:17,719 --> 01:02:20,636
(crowd chattering)

1131
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:28,490
- [Announcer] If you can see the camera,

1132
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:30,020
you're in the picture.

1133
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:31,770
All right, let's see those paws up.

1134
01:02:43,340 --> 01:02:45,570
- It's not just about
the animal characters.

1135
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:48,280
It's about the people and
it's about the, you know,

1136
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:51,020
the atmosphere of it.

1137
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:53,130
You've got writers, artists, animators,

1138
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:55,700
performers, musicians that all collide

1139
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,900
into this one massive group.

1140
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:00,120
And that's what makes it interesting.

1141
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:02,210
There's always something new.

1142
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,800
My daughter was in the fursuit parade.

1143
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,130
People complimented her on her suit,

1144
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:08,630
thought she was adorable.

1145
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:10,910
You want your child to have
as many of those moments

1146
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:13,550
as they can, 'cause in the adult world,

1147
01:03:13,550 --> 01:03:17,540
you know, you can't
guarantee that for them.

1148
01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,440
- [Interviewer] The talent, he's a, whoa.

1149
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,020
We don't know nearly enough about furries.

1150
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:23,853
We're trying to learn.

1151
01:03:23,853 --> 01:03:24,686
Excellent.

1152
01:03:24,686 --> 01:03:26,328
- Get in touch with Mark Merlino.

1153
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:28,580
- [Interviewer] He's the
man, he the man, yeah.

1154
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:32,160
- The earliest media
coverage that I can remember

1155
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:36,140
was in 1993.

1156
01:03:36,140 --> 01:03:39,150
The crew from Sci-Fi
channel called Sci-Fi Buzz

1157
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,760
wound up going to one of
the early ConFurences.

1158
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,963
And they did a very positive piece.

1159
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:49,310
We weren't as careful as
people are these days,

1160
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:51,600
so if people got it wrong,

1161
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,250
I quite often would just let it slide.

1162
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,923
I sometimes regret that.

1163
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,013
- [Mark] This is 2001.

1164
01:04:02,406 --> 01:04:04,400
If you look through it,

1165
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,930
you'll see a lot of photos of furries

1166
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:09,480
enjoying themselves in fur meets,

1167
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:13,593
and people are talking about
their own take on furry.

1168
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:17,240
Interspersed with other articles

1169
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:21,573
talking about poly groups and
orgies and stuff like that.

1170
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,093
That's not what furry
fandom was all about.

1171
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,550
- I was approached in 99 by a guy

1172
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:31,140
claiming to be a film student.

1173
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,060
I thought, you know, I'd help
him with this film project.

1174
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:35,530
So I just answered a few questions

1175
01:04:35,530 --> 01:04:40,530
and ended up at on MTV in
a rather unsavory show.

1176
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,830
- What was even worse was
the CSI episode in 2003.

1177
01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:54,100
They actually had locals
on the show as consultants

1178
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,640
who say that the show decided to

1179
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,430
ignore everything they said,

1180
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:02,620
- Unfortunately, that was
the image that was now given.

1181
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:05,870
This is what the world was seeing.

1182
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,230
A boss would see at a clip
somewhere on the news.

1183
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:10,160
Oh, you're one of those
weird freaky people

1184
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,820
I heard about.

1185
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:16,220
Some folk lost jobs, lost relationships.

1186
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:20,720
- I had people at Disney
telling me that I had to leave

1187
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:24,091
in order to focus on
my career or you know,

1188
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:27,680
or else I wouldn't have
a career in animation.

1189
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:30,215
And so I had to make a
decision and that decision

1190
01:05:30,215 --> 01:05:35,215
was to leave the fandom
to focus on a career.

1191
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:38,590
- You don't tell your family,
you don't tell your work,

1192
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:40,113
you don't tell other people.

1193
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:46,200
- That definitely made
for a insular environment,

1194
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,520
especially in the early 2000s.

1195
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:52,500
- And you, you need to sell
your magazine or something.

1196
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,620
You want people to pick
that thing up and read it.

1197
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,830
Well, you can talk to
this person for 45 minutes

1198
01:05:57,830 --> 01:06:00,590
about, oh, I made this fursuit
and it took me this long,

1199
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:02,640
and here's how I stitched
it, and this is the.

1200
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,670
You can talk to this guy over here.

1201
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:06,630
Well, yeah, I'm a writer, I write stories.

1202
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,640
And then my stories are all about furries,

1203
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:10,850
and I put furries in
the stories and I write.

1204
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:12,500
Or you get the guy who says yeah,

1205
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,390
I like to have sex in my fursuit.

1206
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:17,250
That's what's gonna sell.

1207
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:18,900
Damned if I'm going to stand around

1208
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:21,720
and let you put this TV show on

1209
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,470
that's going to make them embarrassed

1210
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:26,030
to be a part of this remarkable thing

1211
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:27,530
that we have created together.

1212
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,690
So I fought back.

1213
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:33,550
Here is the problem we face.

1214
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:37,310
The media wants to do
stories on furry fandom.

1215
01:06:37,310 --> 01:06:41,740
Very, very often, they are
going to be asking questions.

1216
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:44,000
Does that sort of thing
go on at your convention?

1217
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,300
Look, I run the thing.

1218
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,490
If that sort of thing was
going on in my convention,

1219
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:52,110
number one, I would like
to think I know about it.

1220
01:06:52,110 --> 01:06:54,213
Number two, why am I not invited?

1221
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:57,440
Yeah, you're all laughing.

1222
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,830
Ha ha, it's a joke.

1223
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:00,180
You notice I didn't say no?

1224
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,620
Never lie.

1225
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:06,280
But you can minimize it.

1226
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:09,530
- Anthrocon is not just
for people in costume.

1227
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:12,350
It's for artists, cartoonists, performers,

1228
01:07:12,350 --> 01:07:14,750
and we have writers, artists, puppeteers,

1229
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,170
and there'll be wandering about.

1230
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:18,630
If you see a large raccoon
on the streets of Pittsburgh,

1231
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:19,960
Don't be alarmed, it's just us.

1232
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,250
If they're gonna have
their misconceptions,

1233
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,423
the only thing we can do is
stand back and say, here we are.

1234
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,450
- [Michele Light] Kage is
always is out there talking

1235
01:07:27,450 --> 01:07:29,250
about the money we bring to the city

1236
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,740
and the good will we bring to the city.

1237
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,240
- He knew how to make furry

1238
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,270
appealing to the public at large.

1239
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,460
And it is just so gratifying and rewarding

1240
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:40,310
to come to a place where
you're welcome and embraced.

1241
01:07:40,310 --> 01:07:41,980
- Yes. Welcome to opening ceremonies

1242
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:44,890
of what looks to continue to be

1243
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:47,524
the largest and furriest
convention in the world.

1244
01:07:48,897 --> 01:07:50,410
- Everybody's scared of saying it.

1245
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:52,470
It's fine, sex is fine.

1246
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:54,760
And sometimes we have it.

1247
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,520
It's not what defines the community,

1248
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:57,850
but it's part of the community.

1249
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,330
And for a lot of people,

1250
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:03,210
this community helped them
discover what that means.

1251
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:06,580
How could you just try
to say it doesn't exist?

1252
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:08,100
That's insane.

1253
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,610
- I've been accused of
whitewashing the fandom.

1254
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:13,960
I've been accused of, oh, he's
trying to control the media.

1255
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:15,080
Well, you know what?

1256
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:16,760
You try it someday.

1257
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,630
You know, let's get you
in front of a camera

1258
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:19,880
and have them say, okay,

1259
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,510
so what's it like to
have sex in a fursuit?

1260
01:08:22,510 --> 01:08:24,310
Let's have you answer that question.

1261
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,910
Especially if you know that
your grandmom's watching.

1262
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:33,737
Or your mom or your dad
or your future spouse.

1263
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:38,500
(audience claps)

1264
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:41,280
When furry fandom first began,

1265
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:44,460
it was organized by some fellows who,

1266
01:08:44,460 --> 01:08:47,000
as enthusiastic as they were,

1267
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,680
really did not pay much mind
to the sort of public image

1268
01:08:51,680 --> 01:08:54,670
they were giving to
this burgeoning fandom.

1269
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:55,550
Let's face it.

1270
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:56,890
I was there.

1271
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:59,623
Kind of looked like pride
fest on an acid trip.

1272
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,950
(fireworks booming)

1273
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:08,370
I have worked very, very,

1274
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:13,370
very hard to foster good
relationships with the local media

1275
01:09:14,260 --> 01:09:16,423
and with the city of Pittsburgh.

1276
01:09:18,453 --> 01:09:20,423
I want to keep it that way.

1277
01:09:25,315 --> 01:09:28,630
- [Panelist] I've heard at
least one opinion up there

1278
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:31,340
that the physical aspect
seems more prevalent,

1279
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,420
the sexual aspect.

1280
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,963
- Why do you think, where do
you think it originated from?

1281
01:09:36,963 --> 01:09:38,200
- If you're going to put all your effort

1282
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,840
into one little piece, you
want to make sure it sells,

1283
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:44,250
and the one that's sure to
sell is that hot steamy one.

1284
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,000
- On the internet, it's horrible,

1285
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
'cause like you cannot find
any good, normal furry art.

1286
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,040
- You go into the ConFurence art show,

1287
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:55,760
and even in the general audience section,

1288
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,690
there's stuff that I
wouldn't show a child.

1289
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,530
or my mother or any of my friends

1290
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:00,823
outside furry fandom.

1291
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:04,453
- I mean, sex sells everywhere.

1292
01:10:04,453 --> 01:10:09,453
You look in any subculture,
mainstream subculture,

1293
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:12,370
goth, furry, anywhere.

1294
01:10:12,370 --> 01:10:15,000
- Not to the extreme extent

1295
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,530
that it is portrayed
and pushed and produced

1296
01:10:17,530 --> 01:10:18,863
in furry fandom.

1297
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,013
- Next, please.

1298
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:34,460
- We started getting problems with people

1299
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:38,853
trying to sabotage the
convention pretty early on.

1300
01:10:41,596 --> 01:10:43,150
You had to chalk this up to the fact

1301
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,590
that people didn't like Rodney and I,

1302
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:48,433
especially because we were a couple.

1303
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:52,320
They naturally assumed our main interest

1304
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:56,993
was have gathering of
like-minded people for sex.

1305
01:10:58,234 --> 01:11:02,484
And a lot of these rumors
were strung on for years.

1306
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:25,440
- And then a Bay Area, furry convention

1307
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:26,740
was gonna to happen in January.

1308
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:31,740
This same time ours had
happened for nearly 10 years.

1309
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,253
So we decided to change our dates.

1310
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:42,000
A lot of the fans from San Diego said,

1311
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,410
how about the Town and Country?

1312
01:11:43,410 --> 01:11:45,340
We've been having science
fiction conventions

1313
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:46,660
there for years.

1314
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,320
So I went and talked to the hotel

1315
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,397
and I cut a deal with them.

1316
01:11:50,397 --> 01:11:55,090
But we tried have our planning
meetings in San Diego.

1317
01:11:55,090 --> 01:11:57,493
The staff from up here would not come.

1318
01:11:58,770 --> 01:11:59,920
They wouldn't drive it.

1319
01:12:00,780 --> 01:12:02,740
And more and more of the responsibility

1320
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,370
fell on me and Rodney.

1321
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,133
And it was taking all my time.

1322
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:09,580
- [Radio] ...by all the flood water.

1323
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,290
- As the nail in the coffin,

1324
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:13,200
we had the worst April weather

1325
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,693
they've ever had in San Diego in 20 years.

1326
01:12:16,979 --> 01:12:19,573
It was actually hailing in San Diego.

1327
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,423
Attendance was down by
at least 200 people.

1328
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:28,430
When I had the staff meeting
at the end of the convention,

1329
01:12:28,430 --> 01:12:31,000
I said, okay, I have worked with Rodney,

1330
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:35,173
ran this convention from zero to 10.

1331
01:12:37,410 --> 01:12:39,663
I am stepping down.

1332
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,110
People looked around for
someone to replace me

1333
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,710
and the gentleman who had been
doing our daily newsletter,

1334
01:12:47,710 --> 01:12:49,713
stood up and said, I will take it over.

1335
01:12:50,577 --> 01:12:51,777
And everyone said great.

1336
01:12:56,300 --> 01:12:58,573
I guess it was in 2003.

1337
01:12:59,470 --> 01:13:02,480
He basically stood up at the
closing ceremonies and said,

1338
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:05,823
I am officially closing
ConFurence forever.

1339
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:10,320
He had told us that he
had trademarked the name

1340
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,230
and that nobody else could ever have

1341
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:14,170
a convention called ConFurence.

1342
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:22,970
- I feel strange saying this,

1343
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,633
but I expected it to get bigger.

1344
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,450
I just had this dream in my head

1345
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:32,213
of everything kind of coming together,

1346
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:34,760
but we're going into an era

1347
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,770
where people are more about
breaking apart communities

1348
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:42,170
rather than coming together
into big communities.

1349
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:46,513
And unfortunately, there's furry, too.

1350
01:13:53,690 --> 01:13:55,810
- Conventions were kind of viewed

1351
01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:57,730
by their host hotels and their host cities

1352
01:13:57,730 --> 01:14:00,400
as, what is this stuff?

1353
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,810
Some folk got together.

1354
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:04,080
They called themselves the Burned Furs

1355
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:09,080
having been burned by this
image that was being projected.

1356
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:14,520
The Burned Furs were out
to clean up the fandom,

1357
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:19,520
get rid of all of that sex related stuff.

1358
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:24,620
Now, I kind of agreed in
principle with that concept.

1359
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:27,610
We okay, we can have fun,

1360
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,800
but can we do it over there,
where people aren't looking?

1361
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,820
- And I thought, hey, this
seems like a good idea.

1362
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:34,330
Clean up fandom, why not?

1363
01:14:34,330 --> 01:14:38,300
But it was to the extreme.

1364
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:41,720
- I've seen this fandom to
generate from a very nice thing

1365
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:44,780
into a endless parade of human debris.

1366
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,063
Thank you very much.

1367
01:14:46,063 --> 01:14:47,027
- This is Limbaugh.
(panelists clap)

1368
01:14:47,027 --> 01:14:51,720
- The Burned Furs felt
that there were people

1369
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,320
in fur fandom that they did not like

1370
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:58,223
who should be somehow
pushed out of the fandom.

1371
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:02,737
- Particularly people
who like Rodney and I,

1372
01:15:02,737 --> 01:15:07,737
who were gay or bi and
demonstratively so at conventions.

1373
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,670
Hanging out with their boyfriend,

1374
01:15:11,670 --> 01:15:13,420
cuddling on the couch or something.

1375
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:18,163
What if, what if a
underage person sees that?

1376
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:23,120
- So this group wanted
to do something about it

1377
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:26,773
and they had a manifesto
of cleaning up the fandom.

1378
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:29,870
No one was complaining

1379
01:15:29,870 --> 01:15:32,600
when all of the art was female pinups

1380
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:35,773
and heterosexual couples.

1381
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,290
It was okay.

1382
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:42,100
- And ultimately the pushback
against porn and adult content

1383
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:47,100
in furry is an attempt to
push LGBT furs out of furry.

1384
01:15:47,260 --> 01:15:51,510
- Somehow Mark and I were at fault

1385
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:56,510
for the appearance of LGBT
people in among furry fandom,

1386
01:15:57,490 --> 01:16:01,013
which if we wanted to, we
wouldn't have known how.

1387
01:16:08,780 --> 01:16:12,810
Furry fandom has attracted every stripe

1388
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:14,970
of the political spectrum.

1389
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:18,110
Although we could all sit
around and discuss Donald Duck,

1390
01:16:18,110 --> 01:16:20,880
if we got into talking
about whether or not

1391
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,050
there should be gay marriage allowed,

1392
01:16:23,050 --> 01:16:25,473
there would be bottles being thrown.

1393
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:31,630
- It's interesting how this
entire thing got sidetracked,

1394
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:34,103
essentially got completely sidetracked.

1395
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:50,320
- The current alt-right problem

1396
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:53,624
in furry fandom is the
current alt-right problem

1397
01:16:53,624 --> 01:16:55,440
in the United States,

1398
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:57,310
which is the current alt-right problem.

1399
01:16:57,310 --> 01:16:59,130
In Western civilization,

1400
01:16:59,130 --> 01:17:00,610
- You are seeing more politics

1401
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,150
than you've ever seen before get in.

1402
01:17:02,150 --> 01:17:04,060
I think once you've got the
Trump administration in,

1403
01:17:04,060 --> 01:17:05,860
you saw a lot of furries become

1404
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,600
much more politically active,

1405
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:10,560
and that's made it more difficult
for convention organizers

1406
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:13,060
to know what they should
and shouldn't respond to.

1407
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:22,013
- We have a pocket of individuals here,

1408
01:17:22,013 --> 01:17:26,880
intertwining with the
larger online community

1409
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:27,730
of the alt-right.

1410
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:31,783
Entangled with people that represent

1411
01:17:31,783 --> 01:17:35,653
a hate message towards
marginalized individuals.

1412
01:17:37,550 --> 01:17:41,903
- Different conventions have
had politics take them down.

1413
01:17:44,310 --> 01:17:46,920
- For the furry community,
that's pretty bad

1414
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,253
'cause a lot of us are LGBTIA.

1415
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:52,340
I don't think that I would have been

1416
01:17:52,340 --> 01:17:53,620
the person that I am today

1417
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,293
if I didn't have furry cons.

1418
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:57,373
No doubt.

1419
01:17:58,452 --> 01:18:00,990
- Thank you for this year.

1420
01:18:00,990 --> 01:18:02,790
Thank you for everything up to this year.

1421
01:18:02,790 --> 01:18:05,190
And we'll see you tomorrow.

1422
01:18:05,190 --> 01:18:09,273
We'll see you next year and good evening.

1423
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:13,240
(audience claps)

1424
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,637
- [Attendee] Hi mom.

1425
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:37,330
- Well, early on I had encountered people

1426
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:40,460
who said I came to the convention

1427
01:18:41,311 --> 01:18:45,213
and I walked into the
lobby and I felt I'm home.

1428
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,913
I'm finally home.

1429
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:56,653
They found their family,
they found their people,

1430
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:03,030
they found their culture, and
that aspect has not changed.

1431
01:19:06,378 --> 01:19:09,295
(crowd chattering)

1432
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:27,720
- Once I'm committed to something,

1433
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:29,040
I don't want to let it go.

1434
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,690
I can't let it go until the dies.

1435
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:34,660
We've all grown as a community together,

1436
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,220
but we want to make sure that

1437
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:39,963
what we're doing now is what
the community wants now.

1438
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,080
And I know if we lose these conventions,

1439
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,090
we'll lose a lot of our community.

1440
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:47,690
We have younger people
coming into the fandom

1441
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:50,870
and they see how open everybody
is and they deserve that.

1442
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:53,380
They deserve the
opportunities that we have

1443
01:19:53,380 --> 01:19:55,940
or that we didn't have
when we were younger.

1444
01:19:55,940 --> 01:19:58,150
- We can create environments
where people are safe,

1445
01:19:58,150 --> 01:20:00,770
where we don't overreact,
where we're not dramatic

1446
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:04,540
and just try to be in the best interest

1447
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,900
of our attendees overall,
and let them have

1448
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:09,233
the environment they
can to be they wanna be.

1449
01:20:11,347 --> 01:20:12,470
- A lot of the negativity

1450
01:20:12,470 --> 01:20:14,680
comes from these big voices online.

1451
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:17,100
And when you take it into perspective,

1452
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,470
there's a thousand other people

1453
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:20,348
that are having a good time.

1454
01:20:20,348 --> 01:20:21,680
I couldn't let it go.

1455
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,283
I would, I would feel so guilty.

1456
01:20:32,910 --> 01:20:34,958
I think this year went really well.

1457
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:37,433
2,700 attendees.

1458
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:40,603
We raised $15,000 for charity.

1459
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:43,430
- For Denver, we have
Freedom Service Dogs,

1460
01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:45,880
where last year we raised $15,000.

1461
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,080
So they can have an awning for the dogs

1462
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,560
when they go outside so it didn't burn

1463
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:50,393
their paw pads.

1464
01:20:50,393 --> 01:20:52,210
when they're going from the
indoor training facilities

1465
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:53,940
to the outdoor kennels,

1466
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:55,880
- [Bubbles] We raise
as much money as we can

1467
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:57,860
for the charity we choose.

1468
01:20:57,860 --> 01:20:59,980
We try to pick them locally

1469
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:01,943
and they're usually animal related.

1470
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:09,940
- I really feel like I
owe a lot to the community

1471
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:12,110
just because it's taught me so much.

1472
01:21:12,110 --> 01:21:13,470
It's made me become much more

1473
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:15,560
of a open and understanding person.

1474
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:18,510
- And we are, I think,
outgrowing those stereotypes.

1475
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:21,170
I think we're becoming
appreciated for ourselves.

1476
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:22,540
- Artists are really like the backbone

1477
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:23,780
of so much of what happens

1478
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,870
because that's how we're representing

1479
01:21:25,870 --> 01:21:27,100
these characters at all.

1480
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:29,550
- I remember at the first few conventions,

1481
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:31,640
no, nobody's ever gonna make
a living off of doing this.

1482
01:21:31,640 --> 01:21:34,530
You're crazy to think
that, and here we are today

1483
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:36,580
and there's probably hundreds of artists

1484
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:39,023
making some or all of
their living off of this.

1485
01:21:46,834 --> 01:21:48,560
- I think the fandom
has made my life better.

1486
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:49,960
- I probably wouldn't even have

1487
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:51,620
a quarter of the life that I do now.

1488
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,200
- I'd have a different career.

1489
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,130
I don't know if I'd be happy.

1490
01:21:55,130 --> 01:21:58,700
- I'd be just a nobody in a crowd.

1491
01:21:58,700 --> 01:22:00,010
- I would never have met my husband.

1492
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:02,130
I would never have met my best friends.

1493
01:22:02,130 --> 01:22:05,260
- Every single one of my
closest friends is a furry.

1494
01:22:05,260 --> 01:22:10,230
- Just thinking about not
having that experience is hard.

1495
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,510
- Not having that, I don't know what I do.

1496
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,250
- I don't really want to think about

1497
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:16,750
because it seems like it would be

1498
01:22:16,750 --> 01:22:18,763
a very, very dark road to go down.

1499
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,103
- We have our typical
story we have about fandom.

1500
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:28,130
- What is furry fandom?

1501
01:22:28,130 --> 01:22:29,940
Oh, it's a bunch of guys who
like sitting around drawing.

1502
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:32,700
- And a lot of the films
were really popular.

1503
01:22:32,700 --> 01:22:35,490
- That was the first convention.

1504
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:38,240
(crowd chatters)

1505
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:48,613
- [Mark] Our fandom is based on a concept,

1506
01:22:49,557 --> 01:22:52,120
and that concept isn't going away.

1507
01:22:52,120 --> 01:22:54,310
- I go around to conventions

1508
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:57,100
and I look at the fur suit parade.

1509
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,340
I look at the dances.

1510
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:03,150
I look at the dealers' rooms
and how big they've gotten

1511
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,460
and I'll admit it.

1512
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:08,300
I sometimes will walk
around kind of going.

1513
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,140
Yeah, yeah.

1514
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,393
I was involved with starting this, yeah.

1515
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,700
- We're still in it.

1516
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,180
And we're probably not
going to get out of it.

1517
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:22,030
I don't intend to ever get out of it.

1518
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:29,130
I think the fandom is something

1519
01:23:29,130 --> 01:23:31,763
I'm the most proud of in my life.

1520
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:36,940
- When people are having
fun at a convention,

1521
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:41,940
at a meetup, online, or just two people

1522
01:23:42,140 --> 01:23:44,090
who never would have met one another

1523
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:48,060
who discover a mutual love of furry

1524
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,110
and they get married.

1525
01:23:50,661 --> 01:23:53,411
(crowd whooping)

1526
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:01,693
Yeah, that's what we're about.
