1
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:10,111
The little minister

2
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:15,667
Every spring in the Caddam Woods
near Thrums, in Scotland,
a troup of gypsies settles:

3
00:00:15,667 --> 00:00:19,167
Every spring again to the
fright of the pious villagers.

4
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:52,833
Betty Compson as
the mysterious Babbie.

5
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:35,333
In the god-fearing Thrums unrest is
brewing, for a wage cut has brought
the weaver population to poverty.

6
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:58,833
Sanders Webster, himself already
an old man, earned with arduous
work the dry bread for his mother.

7
00:02:13,056 --> 00:02:17,056
Old Nanny Webster, his mother.

8
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:52,944
"Nanny, Nanny, from which hand do
you want to get something from me?"

9
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:17,889
"Tea! Have you really come
by that honestly, girl?"

10
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:40,722
"It's terrible to be so poor,
that even the gypsies pity us!"

11
00:03:52,778 --> 00:04:01,389
Tammas Whammond, first
elder of the Thrums church.

12
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:12,111
Snecky Hobart, another elder.

13
00:04:22,056 --> 00:04:26,333
Hendry Munn, sacristan.

14
00:04:56,222 --> 00:04:59,389
"Mother, I'm hungry!"

15
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:08,000
Gavin Dishart, the new minister
of the Thrum church.

16
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,056
Apart from the minister, doctor
Mc Queen is one of the most
seen men in Thrums.

17
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:34,583
"You've heared that the
factory owners, supported by
lord Rintoul, have suddenly

18
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:43,778
cut the wages. I deem our
weavers capable of fighting
for their right if need be."

19
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:55,667
"One of the factory owners already
acted very shamelessly.
There's been a disturbance then..."

20
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:11,833
"Has the police arrested no-one?"

21
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:23,333
"No. But we can expect any day,
that they come here."

22
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,278
"There comes the police!"

23
00:08:09,944 --> 00:08:21,944
Andrew Mealmaker, on Sundays a
pious elder, during the week the
proudest rebel among the weavers.

24
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:08,889
"Will you feed our families if we
have ourselves taken to prison?"

25
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:19,889
"With everything I own! In compassion
and shame for your violence and crime!"

26
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:58,278
"They knew exactly the names of our
leaders. Who gave them that away?"

27
00:11:06,056 --> 00:11:14,000
"That's that gypsy girl who
always prowls around us!"

28
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:29,667
"I've never seen her, but I was
told, she does a lot of good."

29
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:41,056
"A pretext! All gypsys
are thieves and spies."

30
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:58,333
"Let's chase them out of the
Cammam Woods for once and for all!"

31
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,778
"No violence! I will go
to them and warn them."

32
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:21,500
"He's a bit young though.
To be walking alone between
all those pretty gypsy girls."

33
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:52,444
Captain Richard Halliwell,
commander of the dragoons.

34
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:15,556
The castle Rintoul, where through the
ages, the lords of Thrum had lived.

35
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:33,722
The earl of Rintoul.

36
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:17,389
"There's been another riot in Thrums."

37
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:38,000
"It's so lovely, Felice, to
walk around free as a gypsy girl!"

38
00:17:54,111 --> 00:18:06,167
"Lord Rintoul, there will be
no order in Thrums before it's
been brought in by the soldiers."

39
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:18,056
In Thrums too they want to be
prepared for the soldier's arrival.

40
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:53,111
"How many horns do we have?"

41
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:06,056
"Four isn't too much:
The guards need one each."

42
00:19:33,833 --> 00:19:42,611
"Go to your stations:
As soon as you see a soldier,
you blow your horn three times.

43
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:17,556
"Now the gypsy girl
is lady Barbara again."

44
00:22:06,222 --> 00:22:13,833
"If possible, Halliwell,
don't use soldiers preferably."

45
00:22:20,111 --> 00:22:26,833
"It's your duty to maintain
authority in this region."

46
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:50,056
"Why don't you use your power
to bring the wages up again?"

47
00:23:04,056 --> 00:23:13,667
"Babbie, don't speak along about
affairs you know nothing about."

48
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:26,111
"I believe that you're making an
immortal fool of yourself, father."

49
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,250
"Dear child, if you ever see that
your father makes a fool of himself,

50
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:41,500
I promise you on my word as Rintoul
that the wages will go up again."

51
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:58,000
"There's one exit that we cannot
guard, that's Miller's Arch."

52
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:55,389
"The minister hasn't returned
yet from the Caddam Woods!"

53
00:25:04,389 --> 00:25:07,444
"I think that Sunday he will
preach about "women"!"

54
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:18,389
"Blow your horn:
There come the redcoats!"

55
00:27:00,222 --> 00:27:07,833
"I'm glad that you've come!
I can't blow this here horn?"

56
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,389
"Why do you want to blow horn now?"

57
00:27:14,111 --> 00:27:19,500
"Have you never heard those
wonderful echos in the valley yet?"

58
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:13,611
"Won't you teach me that
blowing of the horn?"

59
00:28:49,667 --> 00:28:55,944
"They're already gathering!
They've understood your signal!"

60
00:30:14,833 --> 00:30:23,222
"Andrew Mealmaker, send these people
home. Before blood is spilled!"

61
00:30:41,389 --> 00:30:46,500
"Put down your weapons!"

62
00:31:21,389 --> 00:31:29,167
"If you resist, women and
children will be shot down!"

63
00:31:39,111 --> 00:31:44,944
"You've let yourselves be caught,
like mice in a trap!"

64
00:31:55,833 --> 00:32:09,833
"That gypsy, that abetstress, wants
to incite you to fight! Go all
home and trust on providence."

65
00:32:29,833 --> 00:32:33,056
"We are surrounded!"

66
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:42,111
"Listen! Miller Arch isn't guarded!"

67
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:54,500
"Do not trust her! It is a trap!"

68
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:08,944
"If you don't believe me: Here is
the horn with which I've warned you!"

69
00:33:19,111 --> 00:33:26,500
"The leaders can escape
by Miller's Arch!"

70
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:44,000
"The others must hold the soldiers here
so long until the men are in safety!"

71
00:34:18,944 --> 00:34:27,111
"You're too late: the boys that
you came for, are already in safety."

72
00:35:10,389 --> 00:35:18,778
"The ringleaders have escaped, sir.
A gypsy girl arranged that plan."

73
00:35:21,278 --> 00:35:30,556
"No woman may leave the village
before we've found that gypsy lass!"

74
00:36:24,222 --> 00:36:32,389
"You may not pass before that
gypsy girl has been arrested."

75
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:34,556
"It was a dreadul night, hubby.
How tired you will be!"

76
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:47,000
"You're right, reverend.
You'd better take your wife home."

77
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:52,444
"My wife? But sergeant..."

78
00:37:54,389 --> 00:38:00,222
"Of course darling!
I am simply proud of you!"

79
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:10,833
"My husband does all that's in his
power to maintain the legal authority...
But oh, that terrible gypsy girl..."

80
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,833
"But sergeant..."

81
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,556
"Yes hubby... say it!"

82
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:40,556
When a few days later peace
had returned to the ranks...

83
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,944
"You are everything that
a woman should not be!"

84
00:38:58,389 --> 00:39:01,444
"Nanny says it's because of
the way in which I was raised!"

85
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:36,333
"Babbie, please don't tease me,
when I'm trying to be serious."

86
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:48,722
"Do you really think
that I am a bad girl?"

87
00:40:52,722 --> 00:40:57,611
"You're a gypsy!"

88
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:26,722
"I loved that boy as a son...
but he's an unfaithful shepherd."

89
00:41:34,444 --> 00:41:43,611
"It's sad work for the council of
elders, to have to fire such a boy."

90
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:53,444
"I have a warrant for the arrest
of the gypsy girl... She blew
the horn and warned the weavers."

91
00:43:08,167 --> 00:43:12,667
"I am the man you seek...
I blew the horn!"

92
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:23,000
"The warrant speaks of a gypsy girl...
Only lord Rintoul can change that."

93
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:28,833
"Then see that lord Rintoul
changes this warrant."

94
00:44:20,278 --> 00:44:29,556
"I've come to tell here that
not the gypsy girl, but I gave
the horn signal that night."

95
00:44:44,222 --> 00:44:50,500
"I'm sorry for your wife, mr. Dishart."

96
00:44:56,056 --> 00:45:00,278
"I have no wife."

97
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:14,722
"But the women, who went past
the guard as your spouse?

98
00:45:19,778 --> 00:45:23,389
"That was the gypsy."

99
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:08,111
"I've come to bring berries
for the gentlemen, sir."

100
00:46:36,944 --> 00:46:43,333
"Don't you know that this is Rintoul
Castle... The home of the man who
issued the arrest warrant against you?

101
00:46:54,556 --> 00:47:05,556
"You don't have to be afraid... I've
told tem that I gave the horn signal."

102
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:20,556
"You've said that to save me!"

103
00:47:26,278 --> 00:47:31,167
"I've said that because
it is the truth."

104
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:43,056
"I believe that you've said it,
because you love me."

105
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:55,500
"I am also afraid, that I've
done it because of that."

106
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:20,722
"Babbie, I love you!"

107
00:48:27,222 --> 00:48:30,889
"But... You wouldn't
dare to marry a gypsy?"

108
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:41,778
"I would dare everything, Babbie, to
make you mistress at the vicarage."

109
00:48:44,556 --> 00:48:52,278
"You will feel strange at first...
In such a big house!"

110
00:49:27,333 --> 00:49:35,611
"I'll buy a real silk dress for
you... White, with flowers on it."

111
00:50:54,889 --> 00:50:59,944
"I insist that the
minister be arrested."

112
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:17,444
"In the king's name I request you
to issue this warrant, lord Rintoul."

113
00:51:33,667 --> 00:51:39,778
"You will not sign that warrant!"

114
00:51:40,778 --> 00:51:47,278
"Babbie, you go too far, child.
What concern is that of yours?"

115
00:51:54,833 --> 00:52:03,278
"He has asked me to become his wife."

116
00:52:07,222 --> 00:52:20,056
"What! A village minister who proposes
for the hand of lady Barbara Rintoul?
Such an insolence!"

117
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:25,611
"I'm sorry for you father...
I've decided to marry him."

118
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:36,500
"Do you know, lady Barbara,
that he has introduced the
gypsy girl as his wife?"

119
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:46,167
"I wish she were his wife!"

120
00:52:55,833 --> 00:53:10,444
"She IS his wife... He called her so
before two witnesses and in Scotland
that means a lawful marriage."

121
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:43,944
"Arrest that gypsy girl and
bring her to the vicarage."

122
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:27,167
"Tell the witnesses to follow lord
Rintoul and me to the vicarage."

123
00:55:09,444 --> 00:55:22,833
"There's a special meeting concerning our
minister, who through his conduct has cast
a stain on the cloth of god's servant..."

124
00:56:00,167 --> 00:56:04,278
"You said, mr. Dishart..."

125
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:12,111
"I didn't say anything, Thammas."

126
00:56:41,611 --> 00:56:46,667
"Read the charge, Hendry."

127
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:01,333
"No charges necessary...
I already confess."

128
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,889
"The gypsy girl couldn't blow...
then I've done it for her."

129
00:57:39,167 --> 00:57:49,583
"...firstly, that he, said
Gavin Dishart, sat with said
gypsy girl upon the wall

130
00:57:49,584 --> 00:58:00,000
of Nanny Webster's garden, with
a space, not as big as the width
of a small bible, between them."

131
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,916
"...and that said Jeanne, maid of
said Gavin, declared under oath

132
00:58:24,917 --> 00:58:33,833
that said Gavin desecrated his
bible, by drying a rose in it."

133
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:57,083
"...and that said Jeanne
has seen that said Gavin sat
with said rose in his hand,

134
00:58:57,084 --> 00:59:07,167
so that she reasonably supposed,
that his thoughts were far
away from his sacred calling."

135
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:29,222
"There come the soldiers!"

136
01:00:32,722 --> 01:00:41,389
"No violence, please!
They seek ME!"

137
01:00:46,944 --> 01:00:59,000
"I ask an explanation milord,
why you come to disturb
a meeting of the elders."

138
01:01:06,278 --> 01:01:22,111
"Your meeting comes very handy for me.
For I wanted to put a few things before
you concerning our little minister."

139
01:01:41,722 --> 01:01:53,444
"He introduced her, to save her,
to these two witnesses as his wife."

140
01:02:10,556 --> 01:02:23,389
"In Scotland that means a legal
marriage. Your little minister
is married to a gypsy woman!"

141
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:13,889
"The gypsies have moved out. I
believe that the girl is gone too."

142
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:27,722
"They've got the gypsy girl!"

143
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:52,000
"Allow me, mr. Dishart, that
I introduce you to your wife!"

144
01:03:57,667 --> 01:04:01,278
"Babbie!"

145
01:04:02,778 --> 01:04:07,889
"Lady Barbara!"

146
01:04:17,167 --> 02:08:25,056
"Lady Barbara, what is
the meaning of this?"

147
01:04:28,056 --> 01:04:39,667
"It means that I adore playing
a gypsy and marrying... and
getting arrested and such."

148
01:04:52,833 --> 01:04:58,889
"You will not take advantage
of this, mr. Dishart...?"

149
01:05:06,389 --> 01:05:15,111
"Perhaps he doesn't take advantage...
but here are three old men,

150
01:05:15,111 --> 01:05:23,833
who have an interest... The boy and
the girl are married and that's it!"

151
01:05:55,333 --> 01:06:10,556
"Remember your promise, father! As
soon as you'd do something ridiculous...
Tell them right away about their wages..."

152
01:06:48,333 --> 01:07:00,667
"...ik will also see, that
the wages are raised again;
above the old standard."

153
01:07:03,778 --> 01:07:11,056
"There will be joy tonight in Thrums."

154
01:07:28,222 --> 01:07:32,611
"And...?
 

155
