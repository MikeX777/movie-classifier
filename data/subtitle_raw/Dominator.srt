00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:25,593
- [Narrator] Somewhere in the
 dark depths of the universe

2
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:29,063
far below the world
 known as Earth,

3
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,800
is the ultimate destination,
 all things evil.

4
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:34,902
Hell.

5
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,374
Here, all beings who have
 committed atrocities in life

6
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,643
are tormented for eternity,

7
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:48,182
ruled over by the
 fallen angel Lucifer.

8
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:52,120
A great war erupted when
the dark lord Desecrator

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,556
challenged Lucifer
 for his crown.

10
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:58,992
The possession of the
 key to Hell itself.

11
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,633
But Lord Desecrator's
own general, Dominator,

12
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,669
stole the key for himself.

13
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:14,208
Desecrator sent an army of
 demons to pursue Dominator

14
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:17,211
and return the key,
 but to no avail.

15
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,316
(growling and screaming)

16
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,693
(loud rumbling)

17
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,647
(intense electric guitar music)

18
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:05,659
In desperation, Lord Desecrator
sent three other warriors

19
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,395
to destroy Dominator.

20
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:12,032
Decimator, Extricator,
 and Lady Violator.

21
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:19,540
But the real war
 is just beginning.

22
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,713
("Carrion" by Cradle of Filth)

23
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:19,867
* Lurking in the shade

24
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:22,035
* Of dark and fragrant trees

25
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,071
* Shaking from the rage

26
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:27,007
* That tore the heavens free

27
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,009
* A vagrant Angel

28
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:31,312
* His with span to see

29
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,614
* The garden swell with terrors

30
00:03:33,614 --> 00:03:36,950
* To banish man and Eve

31
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:41,555
* Another fall from grace

32
00:03:42,623 --> 00:03:46,294
* Whiplashed from the gates

33
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:49,297
* Half-naked and insane

34
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:50,531
* Full-blooded, breasted

35
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,665
* Nerve ends tested

36
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,735
* To behests of pain

37
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,440
* A sombre lot to gain

38
00:04:03,511 --> 00:04:05,346
* A storm slid in

39
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:07,381
* Borne by carnal winds

40
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:09,650
* The upper ether thinned

41
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,554
* And therein sat abominations

42
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,594
(bells ringing)

43
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:47,788
(electricity zapping)

44
00:04:58,098 --> 00:05:01,469
- Demonica's fugid,
 succubine on entere.

45
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,372
Demonica's fugid,
 succubine on entere.

46
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:07,541
Demonica's fugid,
 succubine on entere.

47
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,415
Oh well a few more Sidney,
 then we call it a night.

48
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,016
(groaning)

49
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:18,118
Yeah I know it's a
 hassle Sidney, but
 someone's got to do it

50
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:22,289
or the world will be crawling
 with the walking dead.

51
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:29,363
(lightening crashing)

52
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,632
(growling)

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,103
Still no point
 bitching about it, eh?

54
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:39,673
(screaming)

55
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,675
It pays the bills right?

56
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,124
Oh shit.

57
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,366
(glass breaking)

58
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,786
(loud rumbling and crashing)

59
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:36,897
Oh, if only people knew what
 we get up to on their behalf.

60
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:40,668
And how do we explain this
 to the bereaved family?

61
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:43,403
(bells tinkling)

62
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:51,879
(heavy metal music)

63
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:15,035
- Tara, Fina, Dad and
Sidney are nearly done.

64
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:17,270
Maybe we should
 forget all about this.

65
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,173
- You worry too
 much little sister.

66
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:24,377
No sweat, I've got it.

67
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:27,047
Now let's rock.

68
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,852
(heavy guitar music)

69
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:36,524
- Now what?

70
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:45,098
(heavy metal music)

71
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,517
- Tara, Molly, Fina,
 you idiots, stop!

72
00:08:06,787 --> 00:08:08,455
You don't know what
 you're messing with.

73
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:09,289
Stop now.

74
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:16,797
Oh no.

75
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,118
(electricity blasting)

76
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,322
- [Dominator] Up yours scumbag.

77
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,633
(electricity zapping)

78
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,040
What the fuck?

79
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,118
(screaming)

80
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,589
(grunting)

81
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:07,641
(giggling)

82
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,709
What's going on here then?

83
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,644
Start talking shit head.

84
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,980
- Um, he uh, he can't speak.

85
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:16,149
He's mute you see.

86
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:20,320
- [Dominator] I don't give a
 damn, I'll kill him anyway.

87
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,957
- It's humping my leg.

88
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:25,793
Get it off, get it off.

89
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:29,629
- First time you've ever
turned down free sex.

90
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,266
(laughing)

91
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,540
(growling)

92
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:47,114
- [Dominator] I knew
 this was a wind up.

93
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:49,783
(loud rumbling)

94
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:05,532
(electricity zapping)

95
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:14,141
- Ow, stop it, please.

96
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:16,609
(glass shattering)

97
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,946
- [Dominator] Play fragetar.

98
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,482
(screaming)

99
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:24,752
Strike.

100
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,657
Now is one of you dweebs
 gonna give me an explanation?

101
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:33,026
Or do you wanna hear the chorus?

102
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,895
- Oh aren't you cute.

103
00:11:34,895 --> 00:11:36,129
What's your name?

104
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,131
(growling)

105
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:40,400
- Just keep him off my legs.

106
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,635
(laughing)

107
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,140
(birds chirping)

108
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,052
- Oh what a dream.

109
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:04,024
This tall dark demon shows
 up and oh was he tasty.

110
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:07,260
- Let me guess, he
 made cool music,

111
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,896
smacked some other
 demons around,

112
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:12,632
and smashed Dad's favorite
 stained glass window?

113
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,202
Sorry Fina, that was for real.

114
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:16,336
(giggling)

115
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,670
- Look at Molly.

116
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,543
Hey I wonder what he
 likes for breakfast?

117
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,445
- Deviled eggs?

118
00:12:25,445 --> 00:12:27,547
- Nah, 10 shredded wheat.

119
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,089
- I think I know what happened
 Mister, um, uh Dominator.

120
00:12:37,825 --> 00:12:41,829
My daughters borrowed one
 of my archold volumes.

121
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:46,834
Somehow playing the lost chord

122
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:48,836
opened up a gateway from Hell.

123
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:53,706
- [Dominator] Darkadia,
 the sonic region of Hell.

124
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,042
- Uh yes, yes, quite.

125
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:58,678
And um, well, and
 you popped through.

126
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,414
- [Dominator] Then pop me
 right bloody back again then.

127
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:04,484
- Well uh, well I'm, I'm
 sure there's a reversal spell

128
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,486
in here somewhere.

129
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,256
Oh yes, this might be it.

130
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,090
- [Dominator] Well?

131
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,358
(clearing throat)

132
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:14,127
- Well it seems there
 isn't a reversal spell

133
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,729
for playing the lost
 chord in this volume.

134
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,932
Perhaps it'll be in
 one of the others.

135
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:22,069
- [Dominator] It had
 fucking better be.

136
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,204
- Look it isn't my fault we
can't send you back immediately.

137
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,773
And we can't shut that
 bloody gateway either.

138
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,142
God alone knows what
else might come through.

139
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,312
- [Dominator] Not
 God, but maybe Ozzy.

140
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,050
Or maybe even Elvis,
 if we're really lucky.

141
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,890
(metal tinkling)

142
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:51,431
- So, uh, do we have a deal?

143
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,267
I guarantee to find a way
 to send you back home,

144
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,871
and in the meantime you can
 stay with us and deal with

145
00:13:57,871 --> 00:14:00,908
anything else that comes
 through that gateway, hmm?

146
00:14:00,908 --> 00:14:02,542
What's that?

147
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:05,578
- [Dominator] Uh nothing
that concerns you.

148
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:08,581
Just concentrate
 on getting me home.

149
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:09,849
Unless of course
 you want to throw

150
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,485
your daughters into the bargain.

151
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:14,121
- My daughters?

152
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,455
What do you take me for?

153
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,424
- [Dominator] Ah, don't worry.

154
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,926
I'll pay for them.

155
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:22,963
(electricity zapping)

156
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:31,738
- [Lady Violator]
 Always the ladies man.

157
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,739
Hey my love.

158
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,145
- [Dominator] Lady Violator.

159
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,148
And I take it from the gorillas

160
00:14:41,148 --> 00:14:43,383
that you're not here for a shag?

161
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,953
- Before you hand
 over your women,

162
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:49,222
get him to tell you
 how he betrayed me.

163
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:53,927
- Desecrator never said nothing
about no lovey dovey crap.

164
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:55,395
Right bro?

165
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,731
- Fraggin' A Decimator,
 tank that wanker Dominator,

166
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,067
that swally sad.

167
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,302
- Quiet!

168
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:04,137
I'll deal with this.

169
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,705
Dominator

170
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:09,476
(speaking in foreign language)

171
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:11,011
Sonic Pits.

172
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:14,948
Lord Desecrator demands the
 return of that which is his.

173
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,283
The key to Hell.

174
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,087
You will hand it over to me

175
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:22,922
and return with
 us for punishment.

176
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,195
(electricity zapping)

177
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,496
- [Dominator] Clumsy.

178
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:31,164
- Don't dis the bro.

179
00:15:35,402 --> 00:15:37,204
- They're killing him.

180
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,407
Can't you stop them?

181
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,410
- [Lady Violator] Of course.

182
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:46,613
But I can't think of a
 good reason right now.

183
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,782
(electricity zapping)

184
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,691
- Bastard.

185
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:00,593
- After him you idiots.

186
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,564
(growling)

187
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:26,719
(motor cycle engine rumbling)

188
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:33,726
- [Dominator] Tell Lord
 Desecrator to sit on this.

189
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,495
If you ever get back.

190
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,234
- Huh, you got lousy
 taste in lovers Vi.

191
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,670
The creep's a coward.

192
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,439
- [Lady Violator]
 No, he's clever.

193
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,910
Dominator knows he can't take
 on the three of us at once.

194
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,180
- Then lets go get him.

195
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,448
(laughing)

196
00:17:04,091 --> 00:17:05,925
- Dad what's going on?

197
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,395
- Where's Dominator?

198
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,663
- Well might you ask Fina.

199
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:14,234
It's all going rather
 horribly wrong.

200
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,035
- It was awful wasn't it?

201
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,870
With the Lost Chord.

202
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,339
I'm sorry.

203
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:21,341
- Oh that's alright Tara.

204
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:25,378
I've a feeling the whole
 world's going to be sorry.

205
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,214
The Prime Minster's
 going to be livid.

206
00:17:27,214 --> 00:17:30,883
I was supposed to keep
 all this under wraps.

207
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:42,329
- Good grief girl.

208
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,231
Can't you even hold
 a mirror straight?

209
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:48,368
- I'm trainee reporter Miss
 Lynn, not a makeup girl.

210
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:52,539
- You are a dogs body
 Lendra, just do as your told.

211
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:59,146
Good afternoon London, this
 is Judith Lynn for XLN.

212
00:17:59,146 --> 00:18:01,581
I'm on the the Thames
 embankment speaking to some

213
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:05,585
of the less fortunate
who live in our capitol.

214
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,419
Uh, uh.

215
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,922
(gasping)

216
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,829
- This is Lendra Patel reporting
from the heart of London

217
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,466
where we are witnessing
an aerial battle between

218
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:22,569
what I can only
 describe as monsters.

219
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:31,278
- What's the time Mr. Wolf?

220
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,045
- Who fragging cares.

221
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,685
(loud explosion)

222
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:42,088
- Big Ben's gone.

223
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,656
I don't believe it.

224
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:52,199
- Surrender and Desecrator
 might go easy on you.

225
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,900
There's no reason why you and I

226
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,536
shouldn't get back
 together again.

227
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,971
- [Dominator] You're pissing
 in the wind Violator.

228
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,807
It's over between us.

229
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:01,874
Now get lost.

230
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,882
- [Lendra] One of the
 creatures has crash landed.

231
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:14,053
I can see that it's a woman,
 and boy is she pissed off.

232
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,492
- Two timing bastard.

233
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,495
(heavy metal music)

234
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,265
(scream singing)

235
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,540
* All for fire

236
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,709
* Keep it on fire

237
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:39,546
* Burn this noise

238
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,516
* Keep it on fire

239
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,786
(loud rumbling)

240
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:47,954
* Buckle and break

241
00:19:47,954 --> 00:19:49,556
* Drop it like you say

242
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,625
(yelling battle cry)

243
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:16,649
(sirens blaring)

244
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,551
- [Lendra] I can hear sirens.

245
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,687
I think the police
 are on their way.

246
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:21,688
- Oh my God.

247
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:25,825
What the hell is
 happening here Bishop?

248
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,828
(heavy metal music)

249
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:40,172
(loud rumbling)

250
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,545
* All for fire

251
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:48,114
* Keep it on fire

252
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:52,419
- We'll take him back to
Lord Desecrator, alive.

253
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,753
- Screw that.

254
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,922
Desecrator only wants the key.

255
00:20:55,922 --> 00:20:58,558
Dominator is ours, right bro?

256
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,960
- Dead fucking A he is.

257
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,796
And the bastards
 spraying some up.

258
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:12,505
(metal tinkling)

259
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,749
(electricity pulsing)

260
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:23,716
- What the fuck?

261
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,385
- He's using the key.

262
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:26,786
Look out.

263
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:29,121
(screaming)

264
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,864
- [Dominator] Cool.

265
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,298
- Excuse me, sir.

266
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,871
Could you tell me who you
 are and what's going on here?

267
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:46,138
- [Dominator] Sure,

268
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,975
right after you take
 your clothes off babe.

269
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:49,809
- Oh.

270
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,013
- [Police] You, halt.

271
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,315
Park or we fire.

272
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:59,852
You had your chance.

273
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:02,455
Open fire.

274
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:06,726
(metal clinging)

275
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:13,265
(engine rumbling)

276
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:14,100
Oh bugger.

277
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,412
- Geez.

278
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:27,013
- Get me Dr. Payne.

279
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,281
Now dammit.

280
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:38,825
- What the frag
 happened there man?

281
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,694
- Dominator used the
key to teleport us away.

282
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,962
Devious wanker.

283
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,364
- Where's Lady Violator?

284
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,466
- Who gives a fuck.

285
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,734
- I don't.

286
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:49,035
- More to the point,
 what are we gonna do?

287
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,302
- I dunno.

288
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:51,571
- Even if we do
 get back to Hell,

289
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:53,673
Desecrator will kick
 our asses for failing.

290
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:54,507
- Bastard.

291
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,811
Woah what's all this lot Mate?

292
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:00,647
There's a rook of ale here.

293
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,614
Smells good.

294
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:07,086
(gulping and burping)

295
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:07,920
Smooth.

296
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:13,526
(gulping and burping)

297
00:23:14,927 --> 00:23:19,231
- Hey um, a couple more
 before we um, hit the road?

298
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,900
- Alright then piss head.

299
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,071
To Dominator, may he rot
 in eternities back passage.

300
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:32,679
(liquid gurgling and burping)

301
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,619
(instruments tuning)

302
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,639
- Right, fuck 'em all, let's go.

303
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,575
(heavy metal music)

304
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,701
- What?

305
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,936
What uh?

306
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:07,874
You have to speak up I
can't, I can't hear you.

307
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,678
No I said I can't.

308
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,513
Hang on a minute.

309
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:24,824
Would you please shut up!

310
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,663
- [Tara] Nice end
 to the song Dad.

311
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:33,933
(electricity sparking)

312
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,604
- What about those others?

313
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:38,805
- [Dominator] They
 went somewhere else.

314
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,573
Forget 'em.

315
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:42,775
Let's say we make our own music.

316
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,110
(laughing)

317
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:46,512
- Uh that's quite enough
of that thank you.

318
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:50,950
Um, Dominator, um, could you
 come with me for a moment?

319
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,688
There's some important people
 who would like to meet you.

320
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,456
These past few years
 an increasing number

321
00:25:57,456 --> 00:26:00,893
of supernatural entities have
 found their way to Earth.

322
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,795
We've even had to
 start hexing corpses

323
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:05,197
so they can't be taken
 over by the undead.

324
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,999
Don't suppose you know
 anything about it?

325
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:10,436
- [Dominator] Something seems
 familiar, I've got to admit.

326
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,104
Dunno know what though.

327
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:14,306
- Uh no, I don't know either.

328
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,575
I just feel as if
 we're over looking

329
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:19,511
the blindingly
 obvious in all this.

330
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,451
What, what?

331
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:29,155
What the hell are you doing?

332
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30,923
- [Dominator] What
 I promised I'd do.

333
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:31,758
Watch.

334
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,380
(cackling and growling)

335
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,419
Oy.

336
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,523
(speaking foreign language)

337
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,259
(metal clinging)

338
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:11,698
- Fool

339
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,934
Base metal cannot harm me.

340
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:16,903
- Oh yeah?

341
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,238
What about electricity then?

342
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:24,643
(screaming)

343
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,813
Hey don't touch that dial.

344
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,584
Bloody Goth's.

345
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:51,871
- Prime Minister, gentlemen,
 this is Dominator.

346
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:58,811
He claims to be from
the sonic pits of hell.

347
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:03,115
And I regret to say I've
 been unable to send him back,

348
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:06,118
and now a gateway
 has been opened.

349
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:08,721
I have to warn you
that we can expect more

350
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,858
and possibly worse visitors.

351
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,525
- Sonic pits?

352
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:14,761
Hell?

353
00:28:14,761 --> 00:28:17,830
- Gentlemen, please,
 let's stay calm.

354
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,968
I'm sure Dr. Payne
 wouldn't have brought, um,

355
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:25,304
Dominator here if he
 posed as any threat.

356
00:28:25,304 --> 00:28:26,839
- Indeed.

357
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,341
Dominator has agreed to deal
 with any further intruders.

358
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:33,479
In return, I'm looking for
 a way to send him back.

359
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,947
- [Dominator] Screw all that.

360
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,383
Just find a way to
 get me back home.

361
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,987
'Cause if Lord
Desecrator himself comes
from Hell after me,

362
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:45,424
your little planet's in a
 whole fucking heap of shit.

363
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:46,258
See ya.

364
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,662
- Now uh Dominator, wait.

365
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:55,034
- If this Dominator continues
 to act as a free agent,

366
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,169
there'll be panic
 in the streets.

367
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,539
And if he isn't with
 us, he's against us.

368
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,313
I believe I know
 someone who can help.

369
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:08,314
For a price.

370
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,767
(wind whistling)

371
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:38,377
- Guess who.

372
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,483
Hey, you okay?

373
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,854
- [Dominator] Bored.

374
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:49,188
Hey, wanna shag?

375
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:51,590
- Uh frankly yes.

376
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:56,062
But there are certain rituals
 a girl likes, you know.

377
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,231
Talking, getting
to know someone.

378
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,433
So what's home like?

379
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:04,403
Motorhead album covers
 immediately spring to mind.

380
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:06,605
- [Dominator] It's more like
 Cradle of Filth actually.

381
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:09,075
- Can't blame you for
 wanting to get back there.

382
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:11,410
- [Dominator] Hey I like it.

383
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,080
- You never said why those
 others came after you.

384
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,748
- [Dominator] Lady
 Violator and her stooges?

385
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:19,051
Ah, they were after this.

386
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,954
Most valuable thing
 in all damnation.

387
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:24,390
The key to Hell itself.

388
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,457
- It's, it's.

389
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,229
- [Dominator] Powerful
 is what it is.

390
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:32,064
Shred your soul
 in seconds if you

391
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:34,266
don't know what you're doing.

392
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:35,634
And believe you me,

393
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:38,137
Lord Desecrator won't
 give it up in a hurry.

394
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:40,506
It means too much to him.

395
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,175
- So, who's Desecrator?

396
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,745
And why steal it from
him in the first place?

397
00:30:46,745 --> 00:30:48,981
- There's a war
 going on in Hell.

398
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,316
A war for power.

399
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:54,820
The key, you see, gives its
 owner almost limitless powers.

400
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,291
Lord Desecrator stole the
 key first from Lucifer

401
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:03,629
'cause he fancies himself
 as a new top dog in Hell.

402
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:06,632
So I stole the key from him
 as I don't like the idea

403
00:31:06,632 --> 00:31:10,469
of serving that wanker for
 the next few thousand years.

404
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:14,173
So that's why he sent those
 others to Earth after me.

405
00:31:14,173 --> 00:31:18,110
- But why not use the
 key yourself to get home?

406
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:19,211
- [Dominator] Nah.

407
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:21,747
I tried that
 already, didn't work.

408
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:23,515
No idea why.

409
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:26,185
Sometimes it works for
 me, sometimes not at all.

410
00:31:26,185 --> 00:31:29,355
Guess I'm not evil
 enough or something.

411
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:31,958
You're different
 from your sisters.

412
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:34,994
- Same father, three
 different mothers.

413
00:31:34,994 --> 00:31:37,296
Cost Dad a fortune
 in maintenance.

414
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:41,133
Molly's mother was a
 teacher, Fina's was a witch,

415
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:42,901
and mine was a model.

416
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,941
- [Dominator] What's this?

417
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,977
Some kind of mating ritual?

418
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:52,811
- Something like that.

419
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:08,560
- Guys the cut is
 smoking, I mean it.

420
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,797
- Oh get lost Fina,
 I'll hear it later.

421
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,633
- Oh come on.

422
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:17,236
Molly's uploading it right now.

423
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,607
I've got a good
 feeling about this.

424
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:23,942
Dom, you're gonna be a star.

425
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,155
- I'll upload a pic of you Dom.

426
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:38,090
Uh, strike a pose yeah.

427
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,593
Piss off Sidney.

428
00:32:41,593 --> 00:32:42,728
(grunting)

429
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:44,030
You're only jealous.

430
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:46,232
(grunting)

431
00:32:46,232 --> 00:32:48,600
- I'm here at Charing
Cross asking Londoners,

432
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,503
do you believe in
 the supernatural?

433
00:32:53,905 --> 00:32:56,242
(squealing)

434
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:07,619
(electricity sparking)

435
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:29,208
(heavy metal music)

436
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,789
* Stand and fight

437
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,294
* Stand and fight

438
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:54,066
* Stand and fight

439
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,137
* Stand and fight

440
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:00,906
(engine rumbling)

441
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:15,554
* You're the one
 here to claim my soul

442
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:23,495
(electricity zapping)

443
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,302
(screaming)

444
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,576
(evil laughing)

445
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,659
(loud explosion)

446
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,283
(train wheels squeaking)

447
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:33,199
(gasping)

448
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,646
- [Dominator] Makes
 you horny huh?

449
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,716
What are you doing after
the show then babe?

450
00:35:50,716 --> 00:35:51,550
- Oh.

451
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:00,326
(ominous music)

452
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:12,070
(lasers shooting)

453
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,596
(laughing)

454
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,765
("Perfect" by Skith)

455
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,599
* When I go to sleep

456
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:41,867
* I lay my head

457
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:42,668
* Then all I can see
 is you in front of me

458
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,535
* Why did you

459
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:45,604
* Creep into my head

460
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:46,538
* One day

461
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:47,339
* And you never went away

462
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,874
* Why did you do this

463
00:36:48,874 --> 00:36:51,209
* I am scarred in the nicest
 way but I want it to heal

464
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:55,314
* Feel so pathetic that I
 can't control my emotions

465
00:36:55,314 --> 00:36:58,550
* Why I am so hyper every day

466
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,452
* Because of you?

467
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:05,223
* And I wonder
 where, what you are

468
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,958
* As I fall down

469
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:09,761
* Take my soul away from you

470
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:10,696
* And I wonder now

471
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:12,664
* If you weren't so perfect

472
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:16,067
* What you are as I fall

473
00:37:19,137 --> 00:37:21,973
(loud explosions)

474
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,545
(upbeat music)

475
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:12,958
(loud crashing and
 glass breaking)

476
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,838
- Just so they know what
 to put on your gravestone,

477
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,274
it's fragged by the Hellkatt.

478
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,142
- [Dominator] Never
 heard of you darling.

479
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:34,880
- Ditto, but I've been
hired to kill you, and.

480
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,283
- [Dominator] Hey wait
 a minute, who are you?

481
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:42,388
- I'm half human, half
 demon on my father's side.

482
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:47,192
Some big shot called Desecrator.

483
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,596
And when I find him, he's meat.

484
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:53,632
- [Dominator] It sounds like
 we have a whole lot in common.

485
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:56,635
We should uh, get together.

486
00:38:56,635 --> 00:39:00,672
You know, swap um, amongst
 other things, details.

487
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:06,011
- [Hellkatt] Well
 swap something anyway.

488
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,246
(groaning)

489
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,749
- [Dominator] Who hired you?

490
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,250
- Some politician.

491
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,020
Guy called Bishop.

492
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,455
Dunno why though.

493
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,691
- [Dominator] Who cares.

494
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:23,895
(phone ringing)

495
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,230
- What the hell?

496
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,471
- [Dominator] The Doc gave
 it to me for emergencies.

497
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:34,673
Hey, this better be good.

498
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:35,907
What?

499
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,843
- It's me Dom, Tara.

500
00:39:37,843 --> 00:39:39,545
The band sites are live man.

501
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:41,447
Over nine million hits.

502
00:39:41,447 --> 00:39:43,615
We just called a press
conference at the Savoy.

503
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:44,816
Can you get there?

504
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:47,285
- [Dominator] Uh
give me a break.

505
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:50,556
I'm uh, I'm busy,
 uh, saving the world.

506
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:58,229
- Look pal, I wanna be
 famous even if you don't.

507
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,566
Please, can you
 get to the Savoy?

508
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:04,736
- [Dominator] I'll definitely
 be coming soon Tara.

509
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:08,239
(groaning)

510
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,914
(laughing)

511
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,192
- [Extricator] Hey
 don't go light now.

512
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:28,827
- Listen, I've got one for you.

513
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:32,764
Now hey, do you remember when
 the Kanakium dead rebelled?

514
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:36,602
Man we slaughtered those
decomposing bastards.

515
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:41,573
- We dazed the embattled
 souls for weeks didn't we?

516
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,407
- We did.

517
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:48,413
- Holy shit, hallucinations.

518
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,020
Lord Desecrator.

519
00:40:56,354 --> 00:40:59,190
- What the fuck
 are you two doing?

520
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,064
- Um yeah, um sorry boss.

521
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,601
Dominator used that key he
 stole off you against us

522
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,003
and he stumped our asses bad.

523
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:18,309
- Yeah and um, we're
 just stocking up for
 the rematch, yeah.

524
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,445
- And Lady Violator?

525
00:41:20,445 --> 00:41:22,313
- Um, buggered off somewhere.

526
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,314
I dunno.

527
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,716
- Kill Dominator.

528
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:28,787
- Sure, yeah, no
 problem, yeah we will.

529
00:41:28,787 --> 00:41:29,821
But later.

530
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:30,656
- Now!

531
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:36,494
- Listen Desecrator, you're
 a big shot in Hell, okay.

532
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,665
But here you're just
 a fucking midget.

533
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,432
Copy.

534
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:47,005
- You will have all
eternity to regret that.

535
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,106
I'll be back.

536
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:56,915
- You know maybe that
 wasn't so clever man.

537
00:41:56,915 --> 00:41:59,317
- Oh who gives a frag.

538
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:00,151
A toast!

539
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:03,622
Fuck all fuckers.

540
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:05,023
- Good fucking toast.

541
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,625
A fucking men, man.

542
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,361
Bottoms up.

543
00:42:15,801 --> 00:42:17,335
- [Lendra] What are they?

544
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:19,504
Where did they come from?

545
00:42:19,504 --> 00:42:21,707
Why the hell are
 they wrecking London?

546
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:25,744
- Dammit man, you told me we
were dealing with a few ghosts.

547
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:30,115
- Relax sir, and try to
get a good nights sleep.

548
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:33,551
Things always look
 better in the morning.

549
00:42:43,428 --> 00:42:44,262
I wish.

550
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,245
- What if your wish was
answered Mr. Bishop?

551
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:03,882
Indeed, what if I
 were to offer you

552
00:43:03,882 --> 00:43:06,718
the position of
 King of the world?

553
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:18,363
- All girl rock group Crowcut

554
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:20,165
has set the music world ablaze.

555
00:43:20,165 --> 00:43:24,335
Every celeb in town is out
tonight for their launch party.

556
00:43:25,771 --> 00:43:29,908
I can see Miss Gurley, Howard
 Volderman, and oh Dominator.

557
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,915
(applauding)

558
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:40,652
- [Dominator] Hey,
 looking good kid.

559
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:43,755
(heavy techno music)

560
00:43:50,561 --> 00:43:52,263
- Look I really like him.

561
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,199
And I know he
 feels the same way.

562
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,300
- Yeah right.

563
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,738
- He's stringing you along
 like a thunderbirds puppet.

564
00:43:59,738 --> 00:44:00,939
- Not.

565
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:03,108
He took me into his confidence.

566
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:05,811
He showed me the key he
stole from Desecrator.

567
00:44:05,811 --> 00:44:07,979
That's why those
 others came after him.

568
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,882
(car horn honking)

569
00:44:14,786 --> 00:44:16,221
- Where have you been?

570
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,823
People are getting impatient.

571
00:44:17,823 --> 00:44:21,192
- Hey don't hustle
 the main man Tara.

572
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,829
- Come on, it's play time.

573
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:27,999
(audience cheering
 and applauding)

574
00:44:32,771 --> 00:44:33,739
- Hi everyone.

575
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:35,106
We're Crowcut.

576
00:44:35,106 --> 00:44:36,641
Sorry we're late.

577
00:44:36,641 --> 00:44:39,644
This one's called
 Die Goth's Die.

578
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:42,647
(heavy metal music)

579
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:14,980
- [Lady Violator] Relax.

580
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,481
Don't to fight me.

581
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,454
Traitor!

582
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,724
Pick this you bastard.

583
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:33,064
(electricity surging)

584
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,541
(screaming)

585
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,010
- Scum!

586
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:47,712
- [Dominator] Violator's
 taken control of your mind.

587
00:45:47,712 --> 00:45:50,048
You have to fight back Tara.

588
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:07,966
Fight back Tara!

589
00:46:12,403 --> 00:46:13,671
Fight damn you!

590
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:19,344
- I, I.

591
00:46:26,317 --> 00:46:29,320
It's alright, I've
 got my head back.

592
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:32,657
Oops, I think I've
 got her body as well.

593
00:46:34,926 --> 00:46:35,927
Cool

594
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:37,162
And her powers.

595
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:41,900
Hey I can fly.

596
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:55,146
- [Dominator] Are you alright?

597
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,081
- I am now.

598
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:04,622
- Lucky cow.

599
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,593
- Why her?

600
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:11,596
Not even as if she's
 the pretty one.

601
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,409
- Mind and get beer now Dave.

602
00:47:24,409 --> 00:47:26,411
None of your cheap wine.

603
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,387
What's the big idea?

604
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:37,923
Put the fucking lights out.

605
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:40,091
- [Police] On your feet.

606
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:42,060
- [Homeless Man] Says
 fucking who, James.

607
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,063
- [Police] Says
 fucking me, asshole.

608
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:47,698
- Where are we going man?

609
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,967
- [Police] Somewhere warm.

610
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:50,301
Don't you worry.

611
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:56,541
- The beer was too expensive.

612
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,708
So I got some.

613
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:03,814
Oh shit.

614
00:48:11,356 --> 00:48:13,291
- You caused havoc back there.

615
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,559
This can't go on.

616
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,028
- [Dominator] Then
 send me back home.

617
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:18,796
- You think I haven't tried.

618
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,831
None of the usual spells work.

619
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:23,734
Like something on the other
 side was counteracting them.

620
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,703
- [Dominator] Desecrator.

621
00:48:25,703 --> 00:48:27,038
What's he up to?

622
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:32,710
(electricity zapping)

623
00:48:37,182 --> 00:48:38,383
- Well?

624
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,651
- [Dominator] No ecto residue.

625
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,955
Whatever took those people,
 it wasn't from my town.

626
00:48:43,955 --> 00:48:46,992
- 200 homeless have vanished
 in London over the last week.

627
00:48:46,992 --> 00:48:49,627
Isn't there anyway you can
 tell what happened here?

628
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:52,030
- [Dominator] Hey, I can try.

629
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,599
Lemme see.

630
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:59,370
(electricity sparking)

631
00:49:04,009 --> 00:49:05,176
- Military.

632
00:49:05,176 --> 00:49:06,677
It has to be.

633
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:09,180
And that means the government.

634
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:29,300
(liquid pouring)

635
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:53,358
- [Fina] Looks like
 you could use this.

636
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:55,693
Good for the soul, they say.

637
00:49:57,762 --> 00:49:58,996
To you sweetie.

638
00:50:01,366 --> 00:50:02,633
Oh much better.

639
00:50:05,203 --> 00:50:07,205
- [Dominator] Ah, to me.

640
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,310
Oh you're beautiful.

641
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,944
("Heroin" by Jezebel)

642
00:50:13,944 --> 00:50:17,048
* Can't feel my skin

643
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:23,121
* Can't open my mouth

644
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:30,261
* Can't do anything

645
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:37,768
* No mind, no limbs

646
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:45,243
* My eyes have peeled

647
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,350
* Just let me lie here

648
00:50:57,322 --> 00:51:00,057
* Free from fear

649
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,964
* Quiet on the floor

650
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,972
* For the first time the great
 tales have something to adore

651
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:21,112
* Hell I feel so nice

652
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:26,251
(electricity zapping)

653
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:29,019
- [Fina] This is
what you wanted?

654
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:31,956
- [Dominator] Fina stop!

655
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:37,795
- You shouldn't interfere
 in my plans Dominator.

656
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:39,397
It hurts me.

657
00:51:39,397 --> 00:51:41,499
And soon I will hurt you.

658
00:51:45,903 --> 00:51:47,405
- [Dominator] Not clever.

659
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,274
That key gives Lord Desecrator

660
00:51:49,274 --> 00:51:52,710
a whole lot of power
 he doesn't need.

661
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,713
- Oh shit, I'm
 sorry, I didn't mean.

662
00:52:08,993 --> 00:52:10,261
- You bastards.

663
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:26,944
- [Extricator] God, you dropped
one in a Hackney carriage?

664
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:27,812
- [Decimator] No.

665
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:28,646
(farting)

666
00:52:28,646 --> 00:52:29,480
I am now.

667
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,719
Oh come on you daft
 bastard, we're here.

668
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:36,787
Shift your fat ass.

669
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:39,123
- I haven't got an ass,
 fat or otherwise, have I?

670
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:41,259
- Well just, well shift your
 skull and tentacles then.

671
00:52:41,259 --> 00:52:42,092
Come on, get out.

672
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:44,061
Come on you fat bastard.

673
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:46,331
- [Dominator] Don't
 you two ever learn?

674
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:48,299
- No, not us man.

675
00:52:48,299 --> 00:52:50,601
- [Dominator] What do you want?

676
00:52:50,601 --> 00:52:53,271
- Eh we've left
Desecrator's employment.

677
00:52:53,271 --> 00:52:56,207
We've gotten the sack,
 drinking on the job.

678
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,042
- Okay short version.

679
00:52:58,042 --> 00:53:00,645
We get home, Desecrator
wipes us out.

680
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:03,648
If he found his way,
 then dit fucking oh.

681
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:04,849
- Right.

682
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:06,751
- Now, seeing as
 he's after you too,

683
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:09,820
we figured we'd stand a
better chance together.

684
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,088
What do you say pal?

685
00:53:11,088 --> 00:53:13,791
Let's all be heroes
 and save the Earth.

686
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:17,161
- [Dominator] This hero
 thing seems to be catching.

687
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:19,364
- Hey, we're starting
 to like this mud ball.

688
00:53:19,364 --> 00:53:20,565
It's fun.

689
00:53:20,565 --> 00:53:23,133
We don't want Desecrator
up here spoiling it.

690
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:24,902
- You said it me man.

691
00:53:26,837 --> 00:53:29,440
(somber music)

692
00:53:49,294 --> 00:53:51,028
- Right, get her now.

693
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:53,764
- [Police] Open fire.

694
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:56,934
(electricity zapping)

695
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:29,834
- Hi.

696
00:54:29,834 --> 00:54:31,869
We've got quite a
 night ahead of us.

697
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:35,205
We're going to discover
all your secrets.

698
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,576
And an old friend of yours
 might be dropping by as well.

699
00:54:38,576 --> 00:54:40,010
Cool, huh?

700
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,880
- You mean Lord Desecrator?

701
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,014
You idiot.

702
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:44,849
You can't.

703
00:54:44,849 --> 00:54:46,451
- Oh I can, I will.

704
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:50,521
And you're going to help me.

705
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,128
- But she can't have
 just disappeared.

706
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:02,099
- [Dominator] Tara has Lady
Violator's body and powers now.

707
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,569
She can take care of herself.

708
00:55:04,569 --> 00:55:07,171
- She's my daughter
 for Christ sake.

709
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,806
- It's my fault she went.

710
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,541
Maybe I can find her.

711
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,780
- Fina, what are you doing?

712
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,515
- Mom was a witch remember?

713
00:55:17,515 --> 00:55:19,784
She taught me a few things.

714
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,622
There, St. Paul's Cathedral.

715
00:55:24,622 --> 00:55:29,126
- [Dominator] Oy you two,
let's go save the bitter skirt.

716
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:33,364
Oh yeah, if it's Desecrator,
 we'll be needing help.

717
00:55:33,364 --> 00:55:34,765
Call this number.

718
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,704
("10-4 Rocker" by V8 Pack)

719
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:08,132
* Last night you burned the sky

720
00:56:08,132 --> 00:56:11,736
* Stay low 'cause
 my wheels are high

721
00:56:11,736 --> 00:56:15,239
* Rolling baby just fine

722
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:18,609
* Looking to rock
 tonight, it's wild

723
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:21,912
* Zero gravity on my heels

724
00:56:21,912 --> 00:56:24,849
* I'm flying that's all I can do

725
00:56:24,849 --> 00:56:27,217
* To get rock around

726
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,653
* Screaming in my ear

727
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:32,189
* That 10-4 rocker
 speeding like a jet

728
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:35,626
* Number seven all that rocking

729
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:38,796
* For the 10-4 rocker

730
00:56:38,796 --> 00:56:41,899
* He's getting it in

731
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:44,201
* He's getting it in

732
00:56:44,201 --> 00:56:46,704
(organ music)

733
00:56:57,314 --> 00:57:00,150
(engine rumbling)

734
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:19,570
- [Dominator] You, dog collar,
 we're looking for a girl.

735
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:20,571
About so-so.

736
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:27,444
Huh, be like that then.

737
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,118
- Oh bugger, ambush.

738
00:57:35,886 --> 00:57:38,388
- [Dominator] Chill Decimator.

739
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:41,025
She's with me.

740
00:57:47,031 --> 00:57:49,900
- Fuh, strike a
 line, look at that.

741
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,602
Eh, you would, wouldn't ya?

742
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:54,338
- Well I would if I had any
 discernible genitals, yeah.

743
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:55,339
- [Decimator] Well
 what's that then?

744
00:57:55,339 --> 00:57:57,708
I thought that was your nob.

745
00:57:57,708 --> 00:57:59,043
- That's me gun.

746
00:58:17,127 --> 00:58:19,463
(screaming)

747
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,771
- The chains will
 keep her quiet while

748
00:58:26,771 --> 00:58:29,173
the machine draws off
 her energy and uses it

749
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,041
to feed to feed this
 process you've set up.

750
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,943
Whatever it is.

751
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,378
- Official secret.

752
00:58:34,378 --> 00:58:35,880
Need to know only.

753
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:37,715
Thank you.

754
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:43,688
(mumbling)

755
00:58:51,762 --> 00:58:53,463
Everything's ready.

756
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:55,800
You got what you wanted?

757
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,402
- I possess the key once more.

758
00:58:58,402 --> 00:59:01,238
My powers are at
 optimum strength.

759
00:59:01,238 --> 00:59:02,840
Start the transfer.

760
00:59:04,709 --> 00:59:07,511
- The raw material for
 your Earth body is ready.

761
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:10,047
But how do I know
 you'll keep your word?

762
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:12,750
- Believe me, your
 stature shall be

763
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:15,653
as no mortal has
 ever known before.

764
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:24,528
(screaming)

765
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,465
(growling)

766
00:59:28,465 --> 00:59:30,167
- [Police] Here it
 comes, get ready.

767
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:31,001
Open fire.

768
00:59:34,038 --> 00:59:37,541
- Honestly what kind
 of a welcome is that?

769
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:43,914
- I think we're in
 the right place.

770
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:46,984
(sirens blaring)

771
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:49,887
(screaming)

772
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,722
- [Man] We've got intruders sir.

773
00:59:51,722 --> 00:59:54,725
- Stop them, by any
 means necessary.

774
00:59:57,294 --> 00:59:59,630
This won't take much longer.

775
01:00:01,565 --> 01:00:04,568
- [Dominator] Having
 fun Mr. Bishop?

776
01:00:06,737 --> 01:00:08,272
- Fraggin' A.

777
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:09,807
- [Dominator] Gotcha babe.

778
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:13,878
- Oh thank you, you
 two timing bastard.

779
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,379
It's your fault I'm here.

780
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:18,482
If you hadn't shagged that
 sex starved sister of mine.

781
01:00:18,482 --> 01:00:21,819
- [Dominator] Ah yeah,
 sorry about that.

782
01:00:22,987 --> 01:00:25,690
- Looks like we got
 here just in time.

783
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,624
- Oh do you think so?

784
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,458
Huh, look.

785
01:00:29,994 --> 01:00:32,830
(lasers shooting)

786
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:38,635
- I'll be, frag me with a
 sharp stick, look at that.

787
01:00:40,938 --> 01:00:43,440
- Now, the sacrifice of flesh.

788
01:00:51,448 --> 01:00:54,284
(heavy breathing)

789
01:00:58,222 --> 01:00:59,056
- Oh shit.

790
01:01:00,457 --> 01:01:02,760
- And um, what now smart ass?

791
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,295
- I haven't got an ass,
 either smart or otherwise.

792
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:09,934
You get stalking, you're
 the big angry looking one.

793
01:01:09,934 --> 01:01:11,168
- Bugger that.

794
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:15,105
- Well you're all mouth
and CGI trousers you.

795
01:01:15,105 --> 01:01:16,673
- That's my father?

796
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:20,811
- [Dominator] Yeah,
 that's him alright.

797
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:23,981
- Pucker up Daddy,
 it's fragging time.

798
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,553
- You're no daughter of mine.

799
01:01:32,156 --> 01:01:33,724
Burn bastard, burn.

800
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:40,765
- [Dominator] Leave
 her alone bastard.

801
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:43,901
It's me you want.

802
01:01:43,901 --> 01:01:45,936
(laughing)

803
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:47,304
- Nice one nob head.

804
01:01:47,304 --> 01:01:49,139
You trying to get us all wiped?

805
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:52,242
- [Dominator]
Everybody outside, now.

806
01:01:54,912 --> 01:01:57,748
- You're a beast of
 your word Desecrator.

807
01:01:57,748 --> 01:02:00,584
We can do business together.

808
01:02:00,584 --> 01:02:02,219
- Insect.

809
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:04,521
You do what I tell you.

810
01:02:04,521 --> 01:02:07,357
There is much I need to
know about this world,

811
01:02:07,357 --> 01:02:09,126
and you will tell me.

812
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:13,463
I will suck your
 soul's knowledge dry

813
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,233
like marrow from a bone.

814
01:02:16,233 --> 01:02:19,069
- But, but you
 said, wait a minute,

815
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:22,039
I built a new body for you.

816
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:22,873
- I lied.

817
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:27,544
This world shall
finally be mine.

818
01:02:27,544 --> 01:02:30,714
All that I planned
 has come to pass.

819
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:34,885
You and Dominator and the
others unwittingly paved the way

820
01:02:36,386 --> 01:02:40,457
for me by weakening the
 fabric between Hell and Earth.

821
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:44,361
Now it is time for me to
assume my rightful place

822
01:02:44,361 --> 01:02:46,530
as ruler of all realities.

823
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:50,534
- Oh shit.

824
01:02:50,534 --> 01:02:52,870
(screaming)

825
01:02:57,174 --> 01:03:00,144
(heavy metal music)

826
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,959
- St. Paul's Cathedral
 where something

827
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:16,861
very weird is going on.

828
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:25,269
The building itself
 appears to be collapsing.

829
01:03:25,269 --> 01:03:28,172
(glass shattering)

830
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:33,911
Oh my god, what
 the hell is that?

831
01:03:36,113 --> 01:03:37,915
- Here comes trouble.

832
01:03:37,915 --> 01:03:39,149
- Hello London.

833
01:03:41,118 --> 01:03:42,119
- Maybe not.

834
01:03:45,355 --> 01:03:48,358
- Well go to the
 foot of our stairs.

835
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,562
- What is that?

836
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,732
- Desecrator.

837
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,968
Oh bollocks, we're too late.

838
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:59,536
- Ow.

839
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,972
I'll never be mean
 to a fucker again.

840
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:03,040
We safe yet?

841
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,109
- [Dominator] Uh no.

842
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:06,710
- Can we stop him?

843
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,212
- [Dominator] Maybe.

844
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:12,049
But I say we hit the bastard
 with everything we've got.

845
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:14,718
(loud rumbling)

846
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:19,256
(intense heavy metal)

847
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:32,169
(loud explosions and
 glass shattering)

848
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:45,649
- King of the
 world, king of Hell,

849
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:48,052
king of every fragging where.

850
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,499
- Oh my god, he's
 eaten the world.

851
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:09,039
- [Dominator] Yeah that's
 one way of looking at it.

852
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,540
- We need a plan dammit.

853
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,609
- [Dominator] Yeah, such as?

854
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,044
- It's all your fault Tara.

855
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:15,279
You talked us into playing

856
01:05:15,279 --> 01:05:16,813
the last chord in
 the first place.

857
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:18,715
- Right bloody
 mess we're in now.

858
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:20,217
- [Dominator] Come off it.

859
01:05:20,217 --> 01:05:22,519
You gave Desecrator
 his key back.

860
01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:23,687
Without it, he
wouldn't have been able

861
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,789
to cross over to Earth.

862
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:27,191
- Hey.

863
01:05:27,191 --> 01:05:29,426
- Hellkatt said Desecrator
 raped her mother,

864
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,195
but then he returned to Hell.

865
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:32,997
How did that get arranged?

866
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:35,465
- A sacrifice I think.

867
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:37,834
- We need to find a sacrifice
 bigger than all those poor

868
01:05:37,834 --> 01:05:41,071
people that helped bring him
 through in the first place.

869
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:45,242
Hey what if we get Desecrator
 to sacrifice himself?

870
01:05:47,911 --> 01:05:49,846
- Sounds good.

871
01:05:49,846 --> 01:05:53,883
So what do we use as
 the sacrificial knife.

872
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:57,187
- Look, what if we hit the
 key with something so powerful

873
01:05:57,187 --> 01:06:00,390
that it unlocks Desecrator
 from his new body

874
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:02,559
and drags his
 spirit back to hell?

875
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,827
Something like.

876
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:07,364
- [Dominator] The Lost
Chord played backwards.

877
01:06:07,364 --> 01:06:09,699
- You do that, while
 I perform an exorcism

878
01:06:09,699 --> 01:06:12,502
and I think we may
 get a serious result.

879
01:06:12,502 --> 01:06:14,471
- It's as good a plan as any.

880
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:15,905
Shall we?

881
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,708
- [Dominator] Yeah, let's
 go frag the bastard.

882
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:22,379
(intense heavy metal music)

883
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:32,889
Just make sure you
 time it right Doc.

884
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:35,059
- Just you get on with it.

885
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:41,631
(growling singing)

886
01:06:54,944 --> 01:06:58,115
(electricity zapping)

887
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:20,970
- [Dominator] Oy,
 you lot, follow me.

888
01:07:26,576 --> 01:07:30,647
Quick through there, we've
 got to find his brain.

889
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,228
* Here we go, here
 we go, here we go

890
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:48,498
* Here we go, here
 we go, here we go

891
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,900
- Down there, I can feel him.

892
01:07:54,438 --> 01:07:55,672
Eat shit Daddy.

893
01:08:00,944 --> 01:08:02,446
- Oops.

894
01:08:02,446 --> 01:08:06,483
- You presume to challenge
 the king of everything?

895
01:08:07,484 --> 01:08:08,318
Then die!

896
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:17,261
- Oh bugger, the
 power's gone down.

897
01:08:17,261 --> 01:08:19,529
- Anybody got 10
 pound for the meter.

898
01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:21,865
Oy, Dom, we're in
 big trouble here.

899
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:24,234
- [Dominator] The
 rest of you fall back.

900
01:08:24,234 --> 01:08:26,069
Leave the rest to me.

901
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:27,137
- Like hell.

902
01:08:27,137 --> 01:08:28,405
I'm coming with you.

903
01:08:28,405 --> 01:08:29,706
- [Dominator] Bullocks you are.

904
01:08:29,706 --> 01:08:32,609
Hellkatt, get her out of here.

905
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:33,443
- No.

906
01:08:35,078 --> 01:08:38,248
(intense metal music)

907
01:09:04,874 --> 01:09:07,143
- Come to me little insect.

908
01:09:15,752 --> 01:09:18,455
- [Dominator] Alright Doc, now!

909
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:22,526
- Exo demonicas, exo
 malificarum, exo monsterous.

910
01:09:26,363 --> 01:09:27,597
- What?

911
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:30,500
No, not me you
 cannot sacrifice me.

912
01:09:34,471 --> 01:09:37,474
(screaming singing)

913
01:09:50,787 --> 01:09:53,557
(loud explosion)

914
01:09:54,724 --> 01:09:55,892
- [Molly] What happened?

915
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:57,594
Where's Dominator?

916
01:09:57,594 --> 01:09:59,028
- Still up there.

917
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,057
- I think it's over.

918
01:10:29,158 --> 01:10:29,993
- Cool.

919
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:36,600
Hi Sis.

920
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,867
- You okay?

921
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,102
- I don't know.

922
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,971
Ask me later.

923
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,808
(engine rumbling)

924
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:56,119
You did it.

925
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,387
You got him.

926
01:10:57,387 --> 01:11:00,156
- [Dominator] Huh,
 it was nothing.

927
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,260
- Ugh.

928
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,363
- Thank God that's over.

929
01:11:06,363 --> 01:11:07,697
- I wouldn't be
surprised if he gave us

930
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:10,367
a hand somewhere along the line.

931
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:15,805
Hey where are you two off to?

932
01:11:15,805 --> 01:11:18,107
- We're gonna find
 a bar and celebrate.

933
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,377
- Yeah alcohol's cool.

934
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:22,579
I need a new hobby now
 that I'm stuck here.

935
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:23,413
- Fair enough.

936
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:24,848
Have one for me.

937
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:27,884
- [Dominator] Hey, they've
 got the right idea.

938
01:11:27,884 --> 01:11:29,018
Shall we?

939
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:30,920
- Does Keith
 Richards play guitar?

940
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,789
- [Dominator] Only
 when I let him.

941
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:33,623
Come on.

942
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:38,595
(engine rumbling)

943
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:45,234
- Aw, I was hoping
 for a a threesome.

944
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:49,606
- Um, I have to explain
 things to the Prime Minister.

945
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:51,908
Another time perhaps.

946
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:53,710
- That's alright.

947
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:56,813
But uh, see if he
 fancies joining in.

948
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:12,028
(laughing)

949
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,571
- Oh that was a day and
 a half wasn't it archaic?

950
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:23,072
- Unbelievable archy.

951
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:24,408
- [Extricator] I'll tell you
 what, looking back on it.

952
01:12:24,408 --> 01:12:25,875
- [Decimator] Yeah.

953
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:26,976
- [Extricator] I thought we
were a bit dirty to start with.

954
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:28,211
- [Decimator] We
were a bit yeah.

955
01:12:28,211 --> 01:12:29,413
- [Extricator] And
 for no good reason.

956
01:12:29,413 --> 01:12:30,213
And then we got good
 and we got nice.

957
01:12:30,213 --> 01:12:31,448
- [Decimator] Yeah.

958
01:12:31,448 --> 01:12:32,248
- [Extricator] And
 we saved the world.

959
01:12:32,248 --> 01:12:33,483
- [Decimator] Yeah.

960
01:12:33,483 --> 01:12:34,418
- [Extricator] And
 we developed a taste

961
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:35,685
for ale all in the same day.

962
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:36,886
- [Decimator] I tell you
what, being a good guy,

963
01:12:36,886 --> 01:12:38,422
and liking beer, right,
is really something.

964
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:40,023
- [Extricator] Right okay.

965
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:41,525
And when you've
 properly developed a
 mature taste for ale,

966
01:12:41,525 --> 01:12:42,826
I mean do you think you'll
 be a lager or a bitter man?

967
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:44,060
- [Decimator] Oh a
 bitter man definitely.

968
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:45,294
I'm a pile of Cripple
 Dick for me, yeah.

969
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,530
- [Extricator] Oh really?

970
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,964
- [Decimator] Yeah,
 why, what do you like?

971
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:49,032
- [Extricator] Oh I'm thinking
 of going for lager top?

972
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:50,233
- [Decimator] Lager top?

973
01:12:50,233 --> 01:12:51,668
No that's a southern
 Jessie's drink.

974
01:12:51,668 --> 01:12:52,502
- [Extricator] Oh is it?

975
01:12:52,502 --> 01:12:54,037
- [Decimator] Yeah.

976
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,004
- [Extricator] I might go
 on the Mumps Dong then.

977
01:12:55,004 --> 01:12:56,239
- [Decimator] Alright fine yeah.

978
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:57,073
- [Extricator] I'll
tell you something else.

979
01:12:57,073 --> 01:12:58,307
- [Decimator] What?

980
01:12:58,307 --> 01:12:59,142
- [Extricator] I'm dead
pleased about this.

981
01:12:59,142 --> 01:13:00,410
- [Decimator] What?

982
01:13:00,410 --> 01:13:01,645
- [Extricator] Well
 when we started off

983
01:13:01,645 --> 01:13:02,446
we were just two
 minor characters.

984
01:13:02,446 --> 01:13:03,680
- [Decimator] Right.

985
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:04,614
- [Extricator] And
 now here we are

986
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:05,782
in the end title sequence.

987
01:13:05,782 --> 01:13:06,315
- [Decimator] Wow,
yeah, that's brilliant.

988
01:13:06,315 --> 01:13:07,116
Hang on.

989
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:08,552
- [Extricator] What?

990
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:09,085
- [Decimator] We're not
 getting paid anymore for this,

991
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:10,253
are we?

992
01:13:10,253 --> 01:13:11,187
- [Extricator]
 Right, shut up then.

993
01:13:11,187 --> 01:13:13,757
