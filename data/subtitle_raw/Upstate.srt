At first, I was totally
freaked out by it,

184
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:11,763
but after a while,
you get used to it.

185
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:13,853
[Liz] You guys really live
up here year-round?

186
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:15,898
[woman] Mm, it's been
two years now.

187
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:18,596
-[Liz] Living the dream.
-Yeah.

188
00:14:21,817 --> 00:14:23,906
[Liz] So, how did you guys
meet anyway?

189
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,647
-[woman] Oh.
-[chuckles]

190
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,389
[laughs]

191
00:14:28,432 --> 00:14:31,261
Uh, we, uh...

192
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:33,916
we met in the desert.

193
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,092
Wow.
Really?

194
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,530
We met at Burning Man.

195
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,795
-Burning Man?
-[couple laughs]

196
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,235
Burning Man.
You went to Burning Man.

197
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,325
Yeah.
I went with Don.

198
00:14:53,109 --> 00:14:55,677
Don, right.

199
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,766
[man] It's amazing, really.

200
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:01,117
It's-- it's-- it--
it's just so beautiful.

201
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,903
You're-- you're out in this--
in this incredible heat.

202
00:15:03,946 --> 00:15:06,470
And, um, it's like this
alien landscape

203
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:08,951
where this makeshift city
has erupted.

204
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:11,649
It's-- there's really
something about it.

205
00:15:11,693 --> 00:15:13,434
-Okay.
-[woman] Stevie got lost.

206
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:16,045
He walked right into my camp.
So...

207
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:20,789
Steve says you guys make dolls.

208
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:22,008
[woman] We don't actually
make them.

209
00:15:22,051 --> 00:15:24,140
We have them made
in South America.

210
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,881
They're these traditional
folk figurines.

211
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,622
They're just...
[mumbles]

212
00:15:27,665 --> 00:15:31,278
Yeah, I know it sounds
ridiculous, but, um...

213
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:34,063
they're-- people love them.

214
00:15:34,107 --> 00:15:36,848
And, um, they're-- they're--
they're cool, really.

215
00:15:36,892 --> 00:15:39,286
They're-- they're really
surreal-looking.

216
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:40,940
And we sell them mostly
on the Internet

217
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:42,506
and some stores and boutiques.

218
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:43,899
[Steve] They love them
in the fancy boutiques.

219
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,857
They do,
in those fancy boutiques.

220
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:49,122
And, you know, we--
we import other stuff, too.

221
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:51,341
And, you know, we really
get to work with the locals

222
00:15:51,385 --> 00:15:53,953
and feel like you're making
a difference in a small--

223
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:56,564
Well, plus the twice
yearly trips to South America.

224
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,261
That's not bad either.

225
00:15:58,305 --> 00:16:00,872
Yeah, but I mean,
it's nothing like what you do.

226
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,309
[woman] Oh, my God, your work,
it sounds--

227
00:16:02,352 --> 00:16:04,441
Fuck!
How are you?

228
00:16:06,574 --> 00:16:08,576
How's the center?

229
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,579
Actually taking a little bit
of a break, a little breather.

230
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:13,320
[Steve] Totally.

231
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,410
-What have you been up to?
-Mm.

232
00:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,673
Nothing much, really.

233
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,196
[Steve] Who have you heard from?

234
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,112
I never hear much
of anything up here.

235
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:27,160
-Hmm.
-So, uh, what's up with Ariel?

236
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:30,641
You know, I haven't really
seen her recently.

237
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:31,947
[Steve] And Mitch?

238
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,993
Mm.

239
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:36,778
[Steve] Going through
a misanthropic phase?

240
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:38,388
How's your mother?

241
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:43,524
She, um...

242
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,700
she died last year.

243
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:48,877
[woman] Oh, my-- oh.

244
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,574
I'm so sorry.

245
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,100
You're too young
to lose a parent.

246
00:16:54,143 --> 00:16:55,666
Thanks.

247
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,975
I don't know what I'm eating,
but this is delicious.

248
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,411
[woman laughs]
Thank you.

249
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,761
It's fried quinoa
and some parsley

250
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,676
and dried cherries.

251
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,678
The parsley is from my garden.

252
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:09,550
[Liz] Garden.
Wow.

253
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:12,074
[crickets chirping]

254
00:17:17,384 --> 00:17:19,168
[door creaks]

255
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,521
I'm gonna go check on the soup.
Do you need anything?

256
00:17:24,565 --> 00:17:25,696
-No, I'm good.
-[woman] Okay.

257
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,046
I'll be right back.

258
00:17:30,788 --> 00:17:33,139
[door creaks, shuts]

259
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,147
She seems...different.

260
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,366
She seems strange.

261
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,846
She seem strange to you?

262
00:17:44,889 --> 00:17:46,500
She seems fine.
You seem strange.

263
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:47,675
You're the one
that's on the floor.

264
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,155
[Steve] Fuck.

265
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:51,722
She doesn't call me
when her mother dies?

266
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:54,029
You've just grown apart.
Give it some time.

267
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,683
You'll reconnect.
It'll be fine.

268
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,902
Okay, Mom.

269
00:17:57,946 --> 00:17:59,948
Oh!
Jesus.

270
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:02,429
People change, you know.
Maybe <i>you </i>changed.

271
00:18:02,472 --> 00:18:04,431
Yeah, maybe.

272
00:18:04,474 --> 00:18:06,302
She's probably just...

273
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,217
mm, going through a funk.

274
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:11,438
-A funk?
-[woman] Yeah, a funk.

275
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,222
-[laughs]
-[woman] What?

276
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:15,398
Sorry I can't be more
articulate.

277
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,747
[both laugh]

278
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,619
Aah!
Oh!

279
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,621
[woman giggling in distance]

280
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:25,452
[Abba's "Chiquitita" playing
in distance]

281
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:36,767
[dishes clinking]

282
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:37,986
Let me help you.

283
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:39,857
Oh, no, no, I've got it.

284
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,077
You two talk.

285
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,774
-Are you sure?
-[woman] Yeah.

286
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,216
[door creaks]

287
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,967
The house is beautiful.

288
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:08,364
This is the living room.

289
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:10,975
Obviously, I decorated
everything myself.

290
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,194
[chuckles] Really?

291
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:13,413
[Steve] Mm-hmm.

292
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,631
Can't you tell?

293
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:16,242
-Mm...
-[Steve] It's all me.

294
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:19,636
Somehow, I doubt that.
[chuckles]

295
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,161
What's this?
Oh, look, it opens.

296
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,293
Oh, don't go in there.

297
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,730
You won't come back.

298
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,776
Hmm.

299
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:31,082
What is this, one of those
priest scarf things?

300
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:33,520
[Steve] Yeah, that's
a priest scarf thing.

301
00:19:33,563 --> 00:19:35,043
I do a little priesting in town.

302
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:36,305
[Liz] Oh, yeah?

303
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,308
Yeah.
I've married a few people.

304
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,223
I can marry you one day.

305
00:19:52,452 --> 00:19:55,759
So...this is a guest room.

306
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,892
Yeah, my bag's here.

307
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,459
Yeah, magic.

308
00:19:59,502 --> 00:20:01,025
Thanks.

309
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,901
So, um, you can hang out here
if you need a minute,

310
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,685
or you can follow me.

311
00:20:08,729 --> 00:20:10,121
No, I'm good.

312
00:20:10,731 --> 00:20:12,167
Okay.

313
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,089
I'm the doll king.

314
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:26,660
They do my bidding now,
you know?

315
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,314
Can I touch 'em?

316
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,061
Wow.

317
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,244
You've seen
the bathroom already.

318
00:20:46,332 --> 00:20:48,421
[Liz] Yep, got the bathroom.

319
00:20:49,944 --> 00:20:52,512
It's a little-- little tight.
[chuckles]

320
00:20:52,555 --> 00:20:55,863
Oh, our bedroom--
Sylvia and mine-- is up here.

321
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:57,560
-You know, I don't need to--
-[Steve] What?

322
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,649
I don't need to go up there.
It's okay. I don't...

323
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:00,955
[Steve] Sure.

324
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:02,086
[Liz] Looks like you're
gonna have

325
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,305
a little trouble
with the stairs.

326
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,524
[Steve] Yeah.

327
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:07,788
[water splashing]

328
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:09,398
[dishes clinking]

329
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:12,619
[Steve] And...that completes
our tour.

330
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:21,541
These weren't here yesterday.

331
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:23,847
Hm.

332
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,426
Mm.

333
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,863
You got to try this.
[chuckles]

334
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:42,388
-Seriously.
-Mm.

335
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,433
-No?
-Mm-mm.

336
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:45,913
Okay.

337
00:21:47,001 --> 00:21:48,176
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

338
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,917
Sylvia made this pillow
herself.

339
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,353
-[Sylvia] Oh.
-[Steve] Oh.

340
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:53,094
So what do you think
you want to do tomorrow?

341
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:55,139
Because we hadn't planned out
tomorrow, every single second.

342
00:21:55,183 --> 00:21:57,272
Well, okay, maybe she has
her own ideas.

343
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,189
Well, what do you say, Liz?
Do you have your own ideas?

344
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:02,886
Uh, no.

345
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,975
I mean, whatever you guys
have planned is great.

346
00:22:05,019 --> 00:22:06,107
I'm easy.

347
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:08,022
[Steve] Yeah, she's easy.

348
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,198
You're also far away.

349
00:22:12,722 --> 00:22:14,507
[Sylvia] Um...

350
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,509
So, we were thinking that--

351
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:18,728
Whoa, we-- we were thinking?
What were we thinking?

352
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:20,513
We were thinking
that maybe she--

353
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,776
We're Borg, you know?

354
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,647
Hive mind.

355
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:26,388
That's what happens
when you get married.

356
00:22:26,432 --> 00:22:28,216
Yeah.
[laughs] Okay.

357
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:30,784
I was thinking--
I was thinking that, possibly--

358

00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,058
Hi.

530
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,280
Uh, P-- Paul raises,
uh, alpacas.

531
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:38,544
Oh, wow.

532
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:42,678
[Steve] I think we're gonna go.

533
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:45,115
Uh, ready?

534
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,943
[Liz] Yeah, yeah, totally.
Let's go.

535
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:49,598
Okay.
Bye.

536
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:51,121
Nice to meet you.

537
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:53,428
-And Phil.
-[Paul] Yeah.

538
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:55,517
Definitely.

539
00:36:55,561 --> 00:36:57,171
Way to blow it, Phil.

540
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,739
[boy] Why--
why do you have to jump

541
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:03,264
onto the-- your--
your brother?

542
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:04,874
Why?
Why?

543
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:07,399
Okay?
That is not good.

544
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:10,663
He is-- he doesn't
do anything to you,

545
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:14,188
when you jump on him
for no reason, for enjoyment.

546
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,539
And you just want
to get over the fence to--

547
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:22,936
to go to your friend
or go to talk to them.

548
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,677
But why?
Why?

549
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,202
This is my favorite little boy.

550
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,682
[indistinct chatter]

551
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:31,684
[brushing]

552
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:41,737
-[bell ringing]
-[laughter]

553
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,791
[man] Hey, hey, hey!

554
00:37:51,834 --> 00:37:53,314
Come here.

555
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:57,710
-Alfredo!
-[woman] Oops!

556
00:37:57,753 --> 00:38:00,365
Ready?
Let's go.

557
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,368
-[bell rings]
-Go, go, go, go, go.

558
00:38:05,979 --> 00:38:08,329
[chatter, squealing]

559
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:25,955
[woman] Is he coming?

560
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:31,657
[whimsical music playing
from ride]

561
00:38:35,661 --> 00:38:38,446
[laughing]

562
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:45,018
-[whines]
-No, seriously, it's fine.

563
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:46,324
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

564
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,760
Look, it's so beautiful,
you got to--

565
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:50,328
-you have to open your eyes.
-[Liz whines]

566
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,112
[Steve] Come on, what is it?
You're afraid?

567
00:38:52,155 --> 00:38:53,635
We're getting off, right?
We're getting off?

568
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:54,941
No, no, no, no.
We're gonna go around again.

569
00:38:54,984 --> 00:38:56,334
-Are we down? No!
-Again.

570
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:57,987
Again.

571
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:01,034
-God!
-Oh, wow, geez.

572
00:39:01,077 --> 00:39:03,689
-This is unbelievable.
-[Liz] No!

573
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,212
-[Steve] Open them.
-No, no, no.

574
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:06,996
Open them. All right.
I'm pulling them off.

575
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,564
-Stop, Steve, stop!
-Open your eyes! Huh?

576
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:13,263
[laughing] Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

577
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,440
All right, stop.
I can't see it, I can't see it.

578
00:39:15,483 --> 00:39:17,137
[both laughing]

579
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,705
Stop! I can't believe
you got me on here!

580
00:39:19,748 --> 00:39:21,228
-This is awesome.
-[clicking]

581
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:22,838
Aah!
What just happened?

582
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:24,623
-What just happened?
-No, no, it's perfectly natural.

583
00:39:24,666 --> 00:39:26,973
I think sometimes they stop them
because, you know,

584
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:28,757
they've got to work on them
a little bit.

585
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,063
-Let's see.
-Um...

586
00:39:30,106 --> 00:39:31,717
Yeah, he's working on it.
He's just--

587
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,501
he's just screwing
and tightening some things.

588
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:35,547
-Shut up!
-[both laugh]

589
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,940
No, no, this thing was probably
built around 1970, so...

590
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,812
Oh, God.
Steve, I hate your guts.

591
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,379
And they take it apart
and they, like...

592
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:42,684
-Shut up!
-...back it up and put it...

593
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:44,991
-Shut up!
-So, you know, like,

594
00:39:45,034 --> 00:39:46,819
they pretty much always
get it right, though,

595
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:49,691
as far as I know.

596
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:53,956
Oh, man, I'm gonna
get you for this one.

597
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,523
Oh, you know, we're good.

598
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:57,307
Assuming we live through this,
that's fine.

599
00:39:57,351 --> 00:39:59,701
Shut up already!

600
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:01,181
[Liz gasps]

601
00:40:03,096 --> 00:40:05,359
[Steve] See?

602
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,100
[laughs]

603
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,541
[engine starts]

604
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:20,113
-[coughs]
-Oh, no!

605
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:22,768
-Here.
-[Liz retches]

606
00:40:22,811 --> 00:40:24,422
I'm okay.

607
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:29,339
-[retches]
-Holy whales' tails.

608
00:40:29,383 --> 00:40:32,430
[Steve laughs]

609
00:40:34,214 --> 00:40:36,346
Aw, it's okay.

610
00:40:41,569 --> 00:40:44,180
[Liz whimpers]

611
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:52,188
[clatter]

612
00:40:56,584 --> 00:40:58,586
Hey, do you want some tea
or anything,

613
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,935
just to give your stomach
a little...?

614
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,328
-[Liz] No.
-Ginger?

615
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:02,460
[Liz] I think I'm just gonna
hit the sack.

616
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:04,070
-Yeah?
-[Liz] Yeah.

617
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:05,419
Okay, well, you have
a good night.

618
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,812
[Liz] Yeah, thanks.

619
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:08,248
If you need anything,
just let me know.

620
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,771
[Steve] Night.

621
00:41:24,569 --> 00:41:27,572
Hey, babe, we got to get some
rest tomorrow for the big hike.

622
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:29,748
[crickets chirping]

623
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:46,765
[birds chirping]

624
00:42:04,173 --> 00:42:06,959
[mechanical whirring]

625
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:26,718
[wings fluttering]

626
00:42:28,807 --> 00:42:30,809
It's, like, soulless.

627
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:32,462
[Liz gasps]
It's scared.

628
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:34,987
It looks like a-- they're like
dinosaurs, you know?

629
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,597
-[wings fluttering]
-[thud]

630
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,036
Aah!
This way-- aah!

631
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,951
-[Liz] No, no, no, no.
-[Sylvia] Take a towel...

632
00:42:42,995 --> 00:42:44,474
[Steve] What?
Take it and do what?

633
00:42:44,518 --> 00:42:46,085
[Liz] Just...

634
00:42:46,128 --> 00:42:47,521
[Steve] I'm not gonna --
I'm not gonna touch it.

635
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,044
[Liz] Hug it!
Hello.

636
00:42:55,703 --> 00:42:58,358
[Steve] Sure, sure.

637
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:01,579
We'd be happy to.
Of course.

638
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,102
I totally dig.

639
00:43:03,145 --> 00:43:05,408
They'll go out first thing
Monday morning.

640
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:13,416
Okay, cool. I'll, uh--
I'll shoot you a message then.

641
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:19,248
All right.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:22,251
All right, I'll, uh--
I'll talk to you then.

643
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:23,731
Bye.

644
00:43:26,038 --> 00:43:28,518
-Emergency doll situation?
-Yeah.

645
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:30,520
The doll business
stops for no man.

646
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:32,261
[chuckles]

647
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:34,350
[Steve] Sleep okay?

648
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:36,352
Yes.

649
00:43:36,396 --> 00:43:38,180
[Steve] Feel like a hike?

650
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,921
Yeah, let's do this.

651
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:43,446
[door creaks]

652
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:53,195
Liz, I have an extra pair
of boots if you need them.

653
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,544
-No, I'm good.
-Okay.

654
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:56,111
Thanks, though.

655
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:57,373
[traffic passing]

656
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:04,119
[no audible dialogue]

657
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,144
[birds chirping]

658
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:52,646
[Liz] Do you think we'll see
some deer or something?

659
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,780
[Steve] I don't know.
Dearly hope so.

660
00:44:55,823 --> 00:44:57,303
[Liz] Have you seen them?

661
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:00,175
-[Steve] No.
-[Liz] No?

662
00:45:01,481 --> 00:45:03,135
Bears?
Do you see bears?

663
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:05,615
[wind blowing softly]

664
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,488
[water running]

665
00:45:08,531 --> 00:45:10,490
[Liz] Wow.

666
00:45:10,533 --> 00:45:12,361
[Steve] You can say that again.

667
00:45:14,059 --> 00:45:15,625
Wow.

668
00:45:15,669 --> 00:45:17,758
[Steve chuckles softly]

669
00:45:17,802 --> 00:45:20,500
I always liked that about you.

670
00:45:20,543 --> 00:45:22,284
Liked what?

671
00:45:22,328 --> 00:45:24,547
[Steve] That you always
said it again.

672
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:29,857
It's one of my more
winning qualities.

673
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:31,859
I've missed you.

674
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:33,643
[Liz] Me, too.

675
00:45:33,687 --> 00:45:35,645
Yeah?

676
00:45:35,689 --> 00:45:37,256
Of course.

677
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:52,880
[footsteps]

678
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:05,414
[leaves crackling]

679
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:11,856
[Steve] I've missed you.

680
00:46:11,899 --> 00:46:13,901
[Liz] Me, too.

681
00:46:13,945 --> 00:46:16,164
-[Steve] Yeah?
-[Liz] Of course.

682
00:46:17,426 --> 00:46:20,212
It hasn't felt that way.

683
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,517
I mean, this weekend's
been great.

684
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:23,563
I don't mean that, just...

685
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:25,739
in general.

686
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,697
Where the fuck have you been?

687
00:46:31,658 --> 00:46:33,703
I kind of dropped out.

688
00:46:33,747 --> 00:46:37,751
I-- I get that,
and I understand.

689
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,841
Really, and I feel like
such an asshole.

690
00:46:41,842 --> 00:46:43,713
Your mother died.

691
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:46,760
I totally get that.

692
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,851
I mean, I <i>don't </i>get that.

693
00:46:50,895 --> 00:46:54,986
I can't understand what--
what you must be going through

694
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:58,250
or...what you're feeling.

695
00:47:05,561 --> 00:47:07,476
Why didn't you call me?

696
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:16,268
I would have been there for you.

697
00:47:16,311 --> 00:47:18,009
I want to be there for you.

698
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:56,525
[leaves crackling]

699
00:48:16,545 --> 00:48:19,722
I was embarrassed, 'cause
I didn't go to the wedding.

700
00:48:19,766 --> 00:48:21,289
I didn't even--

701
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:23,552
didn't even RSVP to the wedding.

702
00:48:25,424 --> 00:48:27,905
[Steve] It's me.

703
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:29,384
[Liz] I know.

00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,190
[Liz] <i>How do you</i><i>
reconcile death</i>

705
00:48:52,233 --> 00:48:54,148
<i>when you don't believe</i><i>
in God?</i>

706
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,673
<i>You don't believe in anything.</i>

707
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,373
<i>Someone just</i><i>

708
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:04,942

Sylvia!

713

Sylvia!

[leaves rustling]

715
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,204
There you are.

716
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:03,032
[breathing heavily]

717
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:06,253
I was getting worried.

718
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,432
We should...

719
00:52:11,476 --> 00:52:14,087
We should head in.
It's getting dark.

720
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:20,572
Liz is waiting by the car.

721
00:52:20,615 --> 00:52:24,793
Oh, well, you don't want to
keep her waiting, now, do you?

722
00:52:27,753 --> 00:52:29,146
[Steve] Here.

723
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:32,671
Let me help you up.

724
00:52:37,284 --> 00:52:38,807
Hey...

725
00:52:39,721 --> 00:52:41,245
Come on.

726
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:48,295
I'm sorry.

727
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:53,605
I know.

728
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,738
I know.

729
00:52:58,262 --> 00:52:59,915
We were just...

730
00:52:59,959 --> 00:53:01,917
catching up.

731
00:53:03,919 --> 00:53:08,054
And I'm sorry I've...

732
00:53:08,097 --> 00:53:10,317
I've been a little distant
this weekend.

733
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,975
Liz and I have this thing.

734
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:18,195
Yeah, you have this thing.

735
00:53:18,238 --> 00:53:20,240
No, listen.

736
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,807
I don't need to listen.

737
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:24,418
I see. You think I haven't,
since day one?

738
00:53:24,462 --> 00:53:25,767
-See?
-You think I don't see--

739
00:53:25,811 --> 00:53:27,595
See what?

740
00:53:29,467 --> 00:53:31,599
It's late. I'm not gonna
get into this right now.

741
00:53:31,643 --> 00:53:33,558
We better go.

742
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:35,473
See what?

743
00:53:41,827 --> 00:53:43,698
I don't love her.

744
00:53:45,309 --> 00:53:48,007
I'm not in love with her.

745
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:51,576
-Not really, n-- not like that.
-Jesus Christ.

746
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:53,665
Fuck! This isn't
coming out right.

747
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,407
Okay, look, you've--

748
00:53:56,450 --> 00:53:58,844
you've never imagined--

749
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:00,933
-What?
-You...

750
00:54:00,976 --> 00:54:03,065
-I'm the only--
-What are you saying?

751
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:04,980
You are my husband,
I love you, we're married.

752
00:54:05,024 --> 00:54:07,244
I love you, too.

753
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:08,941
And I don't want
anything to change.

754
00:54:08,984 --> 00:54:11,465
Well, then you better stop
talking right about now.

755
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:13,032
No, no.

756
00:54:17,123 --> 00:54:19,430
[insects chirping]

757
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:41,321
-[knock on door]
-[Sylvia] Hey, it's me.

758
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,018
Um...

759
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:47,371
Hi. I'm just changing.

760
00:54:47,414 --> 00:54:49,024
[Sylvia] Can I come in?

761
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:52,898
Sure.

762
00:55:00,166 --> 00:55:02,255
Just gonna put my shirt on.

763
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,482
-I should check you for ticks.
-What?

764
00:55:11,525 --> 00:55:13,092
Deer ticks.
We have a lot of them.

765
00:55:13,135 --> 00:55:14,485
You can catch Lyme disease.
It's really serious.

766
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:16,443
I should check you.

767
00:55:16,487 --> 00:55:20,012
-Uh, I can check myself.
-No, it's better if I do it.

768
00:55:20,055 --> 00:55:22,144
It'll only take a second.

769
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:24,495
Oh.

770
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:52,000
Mm.

771
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:57,441
[pats]
Take your pants off.

772
00:55:57,484 --> 00:55:59,747
[chuckles softly]

[sniffles]

774
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:37,323
I, uh...

775
00:57:43,372 --> 00:57:46,680
I wanted to have that feeling,
you know?

776
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:02,653
Like you're in a room with
someone and you're not

777
00:58:02,696 --> 00:58:05,786
talking or saying anything,
but...

778
00:58:12,619 --> 00:58:14,316
you just know.

779
00:58:20,279 --> 00:58:22,020
[sniffles]

780
00:58:22,063 --> 00:58:25,502
Not that they love you, but
they really know who you are.

781
00:58:56,968 --> 00:58:58,230
[sniffles]

782
00:59:02,887 --> 00:59:05,150
I think I just got confused.

783

[Liz chuckles]

787
01:00:56,391 --> 01:00:58,306
We had sex once.

788
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:14,061
Why don't you guys have kids?

789
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,330
We tried.

790
01:01:27,771 --> 01:01:29,686
I had a few miscarriages.

791
01:01:35,822 --> 01:01:38,216
That's what happens
when you get old.

792
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:45,005
You got to have
your first kid by 35.

793
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:46,703
They don't tell you that.

794
01:01:49,140 --> 01:01:51,272
Who knows, maybe we'll adopt.

795
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:55,494
Gonna go Asian
or Eastern European?

796
01:01:55,537 --> 01:01:57,496
What's wrong
with South American?

797
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:59,803
[Liz chuckles]
Not a damn thing.

798
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:01,848
We'll see.

799
01:02:01,892 --> 01:02:04,546
Plus, you have experience
importing from that region.

800
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,461
Oh!
Nice one.

801
01:02:06,505 --> 01:02:08,420
[laughs]

802
01:02:09,682 --> 01:02:12,163
-You should freeze your eggs.
-[Liz] What?!

803
01:02:12,206 --> 01:02:14,643
Seriously, think about it.
You should.

804
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:23,565
I don't know.

805
01:02:23,609 --> 01:02:26,351
I don't think I'd be
a very good parent.

806
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:33,750
Man, I need a bathtub.

807
01:02:33,793 --> 01:02:35,839
Shit dreams are made of.

808
01:02:35,882 --> 01:02:38,667
[both laugh]

809
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:50,114
It was just once?

810
01:02:50,157 --> 01:02:52,377
Yeah.

811
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,379
It was a long time ago.

812
01:03:01,342 --> 01:03:03,083
I like being old.

813
01:03:04,998 --> 01:03:06,652
Besides the miscarriages.

814
01:03:06,695 --> 01:03:09,611
-You're not old, Sylvia.
-Relatively.

815
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:13,615
When you're old...

816
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:18,403
you start liking yourself.

817
01:03:24,409 --> 01:03:26,454
I wanna like myself.

818
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,154
[Sylvia] You will.

819
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:33,200
Hungry?

820
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,274
Sorry to pull you out.

821
01:04:06,277 --> 01:04:08,322
[insects chirping]

822
01:04:19,725 --> 01:04:21,727
[Liz] Who eats their pizza
with a fork?

823
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:23,076
You do.

824
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:25,600
[both laugh]

825
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:27,472
[Steve] You better take it fast
'cause it...

826
01:04:27,515 --> 01:04:28,734
-[Sylvia] Okay.
-[Steve] All right.

827
01:04:28,777 --> 01:04:30,388
[bottle clanks]

828
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:32,477
-[Steve] You need to drink.
-[Sylvia] Oh, yeah?

829
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,088
-I am, I am!
-The power of Christ compel...

830
01:04:35,132 --> 01:04:37,134
[Steve and Liz laughing]

831
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:40,050
I'm eating a carrot
and smoking a joint.

832
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:42,704
-That's kind of gross.
-You guys, I didn't--

833
01:04:42,748 --> 01:04:44,619
I wanted to tell you
about the other nun.

834
01:04:44,663 --> 01:04:46,143
[Liz] What?

835
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:48,145
The one that I gave
a nervous breakdown to.

836
01:04:48,188 --> 01:04:50,974
That's what she gets for being
so right about everything.

837
01:04:51,017 --> 01:04:52,584
-"Nun" too soon.
-[Sylvia] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

838
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:55,282
No, well, seriously,
she taught typing,

839
01:04:55,326 --> 01:05:00,157
and we would, like, stick
pencils in the doorknobs

840
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,246
and break them off,
break them off, break them off.

841
01:05:02,289 --> 01:05:04,596
[Steve and Sylvia laugh]

842
01:05:07,425 --> 01:05:10,210
[both laughing]

843
01:05:16,869 --> 01:05:18,827
[Liz] We just got it.

844
01:05:24,355 --> 01:05:26,835
We should go for a walk.

845
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:29,708
I think that's
a really bad idea.

846
01:05:29,751 --> 01:05:31,971
-Yeah, that's a horrible idea.
-[Steve] No, no.

847
01:05:32,015 --> 01:05:34,321
We've got to-- we've got
to get the blood moving.

848
01:05:34,365 --> 01:05:35,975
[Sylvia laughs]

849
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,804
I'm pretty sure my blood
is moving all the time.

850
01:05:38,847 --> 01:05:41,285
It's kind of upsetting
if you think about it.

851
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:49,380
What if we tried
to be very still?

852
01:05:55,255 --> 01:05:56,865
-[howling]
-Oh, God!

853
01:05:56,909 --> 01:05:58,476
What was that?

854
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:00,652
[overlapping chatter]

855
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:02,784
[all laughing]

856
01:06:06,353 --> 01:06:09,313
-Oh...
-[Steve] You all right?

857
01:06:09,356 --> 01:06:11,663
It's probably just
the Ionics' dog.

858
01:06:11,706 --> 01:06:14,535
Oh, yeah,
it makes this weird sound

859
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,624
because they put
this collar on it

860
01:06:16,668 --> 01:06:19,801
that shocks it
every time it barks

861
01:06:19,845 --> 01:06:22,195
'cause it makes these
horrible growling noises.

862
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,763
Anyone want an omelette?
I want to make an omelette.

863
01:06:24,806 --> 01:06:27,896
How can you possibly be hungry?

864
01:06:31,509 --> 01:06:34,164
What are you gonna put in the
omelette, babe? With some peas.

865
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:36,731
-Peas in an omelette?
-[Sylvia] Yeah! Why not?

866
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:40,387
Experimental omelette!

867
01:06:40,431 --> 01:06:42,041
Yeah!

868
01:06:42,085 --> 01:06:45,262
[Steve] Um, peas and hot sauce.

869
01:06:45,305 --> 01:06:47,829
Is Apple peanut butter weird
to put in an omelette?

870
01:06:47,873 --> 01:06:50,484
[Steve] No, I don't think so.
This is our omelette, babe.

871
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:52,225
We're making this
how we want it.

872
01:06:52,269 --> 01:06:54,706
-[Sylvia] Here.
-[Steve] Thank you.

873
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:57,143
-What you chopping there?
-[dog howling]

874
01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:58,840
[Sylvia] Shallots.

875
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:00,668
Muy good.

876
01:07:00,712 --> 01:07:02,366
[Steve] Okay.

877
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:08,720
Oh-ho-ho, yeah.
Listen to that sizzle.

878
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:10,374
-[chuckles]
-[chopping]

879
01:07:10,417 --> 01:07:11,723
[Sylvia] Is that a good thing?

880
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:13,725
I think we should turn
the heat down.

881
01:07:16,815 --> 01:07:19,078
Oh!

882
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,037
I like the way you think.

883
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:24,388
Okay. This is looking
well-ordered here.

884
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:26,781
-Peas.
-Get that in there.

885
01:07:30,742 --> 01:07:34,137
And let's, um-- let's get
focused here, though,

886
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:35,747
'cause I think this is--
this is really

887
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,488
in a good place right now.

888
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:44,060
Okay.
I think it's good.

889
01:07:44,103 --> 01:07:46,758
-All right.
-[Sylvia] Yeah?

890
01:07:46,801 --> 01:07:49,282
[Steve] And here we go.

891
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,086
I know.
This is a terrible omelette.

892
01:08:12,523 --> 01:08:15,830
It's okay.
We will rebuild.

893
01:08:15,874 --> 01:08:18,398
We have to help that dog.

894
01:08:18,442 --> 01:08:19,834
What dog?

895
01:08:20,792 --> 01:08:22,576
The Ionics' dog?

896
01:08:23,447 --> 01:08:26,754
-[Steve] Oh, no.
-Oh, yeah.

897
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:29,366
Look, I assure you,
the next time we're in town,

898
01:08:29,409 --> 01:08:31,585
I will give them
a very stern look.

899
01:08:31,629 --> 01:08:32,891
We won't send them
a holiday card.

900
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:34,849
No holiday card.

901
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:37,243
We send out holiday cards?

902
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:41,813
We have to destroy that collar.
It's an abomination.

903
01:08:44,337 --> 01:08:45,817
Well, you know what this is,
is a shock.

904
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:48,472
It's really not that bad.

905
01:08:48,515 --> 01:08:51,344
No, I-- I can't get that sound
out of my head.

906
01:08:57,872 --> 01:09:00,266
[Steve] Keep low, keep quiet.
Let's go.

907
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:04,183
[Steve speaks indistinctly]

908
01:09:04,227 --> 01:09:05,489
[Liz] Wait. Where are we going?
Wait.

909
01:09:05,532 --> 01:09:06,577
-[Sylvia] This way.
-[Liz] Wait.

910
01:09:06,620 --> 01:09:08,013
Where are you going?
Hey!

911
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:15,760
-[giggling]
-Shh!

912
01:09:15,803 --> 01:09:17,065
[dog whining]

913
01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:18,806
[laughs]

914
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:25,639
-Hi! See? [Laughing]
-What's that?

915
01:09:25,683 --> 01:09:26,901
-Oh, my God.
-Shh.

916
01:09:26,945 --> 01:09:28,251
[Sylvia laughing]

917
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:30,078
-[dog whines]
-[Liz speaks indistinctly]

918
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,652
[Liz] Oh, my God.

919
01:09:38,696 --> 01:09:40,350
Go!
Go, go, go, go.

920
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:43,091
[dog barking]

921
01:09:45,268 --> 01:09:48,053
[both giggling]

922
01:09:48,096 --> 01:09:50,621
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

923
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:55,887
Go!
Go, go.

924
01:09:57,149 --> 01:09:58,498
Go.

925
01:09:59,456 --> 01:10:00,413
[dish clanks]

926
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:02,110
[giggling continues]

927
01:10:02,850 --> 01:10:05,766
-Oh!
-Why are we sitting in the dark?

928
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,204
-[Steve] Shh!
-[Sylvia laughs]

929
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:10,162
[Steve] I'm gonna put
this collar on you.

930
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,598
[Liz] Give me that thing.

931
01:10:11,642 --> 01:10:13,731
[dog barking in distance]

932
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,651
Woof!

933
01:10:20,694 --> 01:10:22,174
[Sylvia laughing]

934
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:24,481
-[imitates dog barking]
-[Steve] God.

935
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:27,397
[Liz] That doesn't work.
Here, you try it.

936
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,702
[Sylvia inhales deeply]

937
01:10:28,746 --> 01:10:30,226
[barks loudly]

938
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:32,228
[Liz laughs]

939
01:10:32,271 --> 01:10:33,751
[overlapping chatter]

940
01:10:33,794 --> 01:10:36,362
[Liz] Let me try.
Try this one.

941
01:10:36,406 --> 01:10:38,059
Yip, yip, yip, yip!

942
01:10:38,103 --> 01:10:39,583
[Steve] God, that fucking noise.

943
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:40,888
-[Liz] What noise?
-[Steve] You don't hear that?

944
01:10:40,932 --> 01:10:43,978
High-pitched screeching noise?

945
01:10:44,022 --> 01:10:46,851
[Sylvia] Oh, my God.
I know what this is.

946
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:48,853
This doesn't shock you.

947
01:10:48,896 --> 01:10:53,074
If you bark, it makes
a high-pitched screeching noise

948
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:55,599
that only dogs can hear.

949
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:57,340
-[Liz] Steve heard it.
-[Sylvia] I know!

950
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:59,342
[Liz laughs]

951
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:01,039
[Steve] What are you
laughing about?

952
01:11:01,082 --> 01:11:04,434
[both laughing]

953
01:11:04,477 --> 01:11:06,697
[dog barking in distance]

954
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:09,743
[Liz] Oh, my God,
that dog barks a lot.

955
01:11:09,787 --> 01:11:12,703
[Sylvia] We have to go and put
this collar back on him.

956
01:11:12,746 --> 01:11:15,140
-No. No.
-[Liz] No, I totally agree.

957
01:11:15,183 --> 01:11:16,750
-[Steve] No.
-[Liz] Yeah.

958
01:11:16,794 --> 01:11:20,058
You. You were the one
just crying about the poor dog.

959
01:11:20,101 --> 01:11:22,669
[Liz] Well, I'm a poor drunk.
What can I say?

960
01:11:22,713 --> 01:11:25,759
Well, you guys have fun.
I'm staying here.

961
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:29,067
[Sylvia] We're out of omelette.
What are we gonna do?

962
01:11:29,110 --> 01:11:30,895
[Liz] I don't know.
Let me see that.

963
01:11:30,938 --> 01:11:32,244
[Sylvia] Veggie dogs.

964
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,072
[Liz] Veggie dogs?
Will it go for that?

965
01:11:34,115 --> 01:11:35,726
[Sylvia] Well, it ate
that fucking omelette.

966
01:11:35,769 --> 01:11:37,641
[Steve] Don't insult
my omelette.

967
01:11:37,684 --> 01:11:39,033
[Sylvia] I don't...

968
01:11:42,689 --> 01:11:44,909
Um, Cap'n Crunch!

969
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:46,650
[Liz] Oh, no, that'll
scratch up its mouth.

970
01:11:46,693 --> 01:11:47,912
[Sylvia] Oh.

971
01:11:50,958 --> 01:11:54,135
-[laughs]
-[Liz] What?

972
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:56,486
-What are you laughing at?
-[Sylvia] Jackpot.

973
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:58,618
[Liz] What is that?

974
01:11:58,662 --> 01:12:01,099
[Sylvia] I think it actually
came from the Ionics!

975
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:03,754
[both laughing]

976
01:12:07,366 --> 01:12:09,455
Okay.
Let's go, let's go.

977
01:12:09,499 --> 01:12:11,065
Okay.

978
01:12:11,109 --> 01:12:13,677
Do you have the collar?
[laughs] The collar?

979
01:12:13,720 --> 01:12:15,374
-Give me the collar!
-Let's go.

980
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:16,636
[Liz] Go, go, go.

981
01:12:17,637 --> 01:12:19,117
Here, you take this.

982
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,729
[both laughing]

983
01:12:22,773 --> 01:12:25,036
[birds chirping]

984
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:43,968
[sighs]

985
01:12:45,578 --> 01:12:47,232
Oh, God.

986
01:12:50,583 --> 01:12:52,237
[groans]

987
01:12:53,891 --> 01:12:55,936
[silverware clinking]

988
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:06,251
Sorry.
Did I wake you?

989
01:13:06,294 --> 01:13:08,949
No, booze wore off.

990
01:13:08,993 --> 01:13:10,690
Ditto.

991
01:13:13,954 --> 01:13:15,956
You want help?

992
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,828
-Dry?
-Mm.

993
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:23,311
[birds chirping]

994
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:24,791
[speaks indistinctly]

995
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:41,939
-[glass shatters]
-Fuck!

996
01:13:41,982 --> 01:13:43,506
<i>Fuck.</i>

997
01:13:45,682 --> 01:13:47,466
Sylvia will love that.

998
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:56,432
Remember when
you lived with Iris?

999
01:13:56,475 --> 01:13:59,086
[chuckles]
Yeah.

1000
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:01,001
Yeah, and whenever she would
break something...

1001
01:14:01,045 --> 01:14:02,916
-Just leave a note...
-...she wouldn't pick it up.

1002
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:04,875
-...that said "Broken glass."
-'Cause she was amazing.

1003
01:14:04,918 --> 01:14:06,964
Picking it up would have been
so much more difficult.

1004
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:09,140
I know.

1005
01:14:09,183 --> 01:14:12,535
God, and whenever she would buy
toilet paper, she would, like...

1006
01:14:12,578 --> 01:14:14,406
Invoice you for, like, 33 cents.

1007
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,060
Unbelievable.

1008
01:14:16,103 --> 01:14:17,801
[both sigh]

1009
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:19,542
-[laughs]
-She was a magical woman.

1010
01:14:19,585 --> 01:14:22,588
Sometimes I wonder if she ever
really existed at all.

1011
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:24,024
Are you suggesting
that Iris was

1012
01:14:24,068 --> 01:14:26,113
a figment of our imaginations?

1013
01:14:26,157 --> 01:14:29,421
Maybe she existed
on the astral plane.

1014
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,468
You were tapping into some
pretty heavy shit back then.

1015
01:14:34,905 --> 01:14:37,255
[both chuckle]

1016
01:14:37,298 --> 01:14:39,039
I don't know, she had a right
to be mad at us.

1017
01:14:39,083 --> 01:14:40,345
You were always there.

1018
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:43,435
Yeah, yeah.
She probably hated us.

1019
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,784
Me.

1020
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:47,526
Oh, well.

1021
01:14:58,276 --> 01:14:59,973
I do love Sylvia.

1022
01:15:02,976 --> 01:15:04,674
She's pretty awesome.

1023
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,504
[chuckles softly]

1024
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:13,247
Burning Man, huh?

1025
01:15:13,291 --> 01:15:15,641
-Ah!
-[laughs]

1026
01:15:15,685 --> 01:15:17,556
I wasn't gonna get off easy
on that one.

1027
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:20,428
[laughs] No, seriously,
I want to know, like,

1028
01:15:20,472 --> 01:15:23,170
were you dancing around
a bonfire, like, hula-hooping

1029
01:15:23,214 --> 01:15:24,694
while juggling glow sticks
or...?

1030
01:15:24,737 --> 01:15:26,173
Ha, ha.

1031
01:15:26,217 --> 01:15:28,611
I'm curious!
What was Mad Max like in person?

1032
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:30,351
You've been
seriously misinformed.

1033
01:15:30,395 --> 01:15:33,093
But there <i>is</i>a Thunderdome.

1034
01:15:34,051 --> 01:15:37,141
There is!
I read it on the Internet, man.

1035
01:15:37,184 --> 01:15:39,535
[loud rumbling]

1036
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:55,551
[birds chirping]

1037
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,441
[distant chatter, laughter]

1038
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:29,933
[water splashing]

1039
01:16:31,543 --> 01:16:33,632
[indistinct chatter continues]

1040
01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:44,556
-They go into the water.
-Okay.

1041
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,080
-You can take off any stems.
-Okay.

1042
01:16:47,124 --> 01:16:49,866
Because the stems
will puncture the skin,

1043
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:53,304
and once the skin is punctured,
you can't sell it as a first

1044
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:56,524
and you may not be able to
sell it as a second for sauce.

1045
01:16:56,568 --> 01:16:58,570
What is the difference,
first and second?

1046
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:01,268
-Well, this,
because it's so small...
-Uh-huh.

1047
01:17:01,312 --> 01:17:04,141
...But also because it has
a bad spot, it's a second.

1048
01:17:10,321 --> 01:17:11,714
[Liz] Now, what about this here?

1049
01:17:11,757 --> 01:17:13,237
-[woman] That's a second.
-[Liz] Okay.

1050
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:14,934
[woman] That's where it laid
against the ground,

1051
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:17,633
and that's where it's gonna
start to rot first.

1052
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:20,113
If the weather continues
to stay as cold as it is,

1053
01:17:20,157 --> 01:17:21,593
we won't have
many more tomatoes.

1054
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,942
[Liz] Mm-hmm.
Oh, really?

1055
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:24,944
[woman] They have to have sun
to ripen.

1056
01:17:24,988 --> 01:17:26,511
And they don't like
the cool nights.

1057
01:17:26,554 --> 01:17:29,688
And remember, the animals
like their fair share.

1058
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:31,298
Mm.

1059
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:35,346
[woman] So you have every
creature under the sun...

1060
01:17:35,389 --> 01:17:40,481
trying to eat their fill, also.

1061
01:17:40,525 --> 01:17:42,788
But yeah. And that's it.
That's what it's all about.

1062
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:44,224
Cool.

1063
01:17:44,268 --> 01:17:45,878
And on a nice day like today,
when it's hot,

1064
01:17:45,922 --> 01:17:47,227
playing in the water is fun.

1065
01:17:47,271 --> 01:17:49,142
It is.
Thank you.
