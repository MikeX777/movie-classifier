2
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,485
Turn.

3
00:01:33,015 --> 00:01:34,017
<i>Fuck!</i>

4
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:43,159
<i>Wait... wait... Please.</i>

5
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:48,532
She does a grab, on the
ground, stay on the ground.

6
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,101
Sorry guys, excuse me.

7
00:01:52,134 --> 00:01:54,337
Slower is actually
better than faster.

8
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:57,741
I want you to keep the fight
in this area. In this area.

9
00:01:57,774 --> 00:01:59,275
I'm gonna have the pads
down on the ground for you guys

10
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:00,611
the whole time, OK?

11
00:02:02,378 --> 00:02:04,747
Hard work doesn't
bother him, ya know?

12
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,215
You never hear
him complaining.

13
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:10,987
He's uh... collaborative.

14
00:02:11,021 --> 00:02:13,224
and that's what you look
for in any artist you work with.

15
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:17,293
What are you
doing in acting for 2013?

16
00:02:17,326 --> 00:02:19,829
I got a lot of stuff going
on, just acting, auditioning,

17
00:02:19,862 --> 00:02:22,566
living life, playing poker
and enjoying every minute of it.

18
00:02:23,833 --> 00:02:25,034
He just has
a positive attitude,

19
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:26,170
he just has a
positive outlook,

20
00:02:26,202 --> 00:02:29,238
he just laughs things off.

21
00:02:29,272 --> 00:02:32,275
And I think it's his
way of, like always fighting

22
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:34,210
to like hold on to his joy.

23
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:36,012
So we're here at "Vice is
Nice", every year

24
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:37,715
it's my
favorite charity by far,

25
00:02:37,748 --> 00:02:39,983
It's for animal rescue
and I love that

26
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:43,053
100% of all profits
go toward the animals.

27
00:02:43,086 --> 00:02:44,855
I, myself, have a rescue,

28
00:02:44,887 --> 00:02:47,158
and it's by far one of
the best parts of my life.

29
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:51,894
He's been
through a lot and...

30
00:02:51,927 --> 00:02:53,930
You know, to still
carry the smile on his face

31
00:02:53,963 --> 00:02:57,767
and be the cheerful guy that you
know today is just a blessing.

32
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,906
He has a hard shell
and this sounds

33
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:06,042
like super clichÃ©,
but he's super loving.

34
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,078
This is like my godmother in the
poker world, but she's one of

35
00:03:09,112 --> 00:03:11,248
my best friends. I love this
woman, love her sense of humor.

36
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,816
The only woman to final
table at the main event ever,

37
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,654
still to this day.

38
00:03:16,687 --> 00:03:18,689
Poker is
great-I love poker.

39
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:20,256
I see people get mad
and I just laugh,

40
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,092
I go: "Why are you
getting mad? just shake it off."

41
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:24,694
It could always be worse,
no matter how bad it gets,

42
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:25,929
it could
absolutely always be worse.

43
00:03:27,397 --> 00:03:29,166
I think
he's honest to a fault.

44
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,434
And I think he loves life
no matter what took place,

45
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,703
and I think he
doesn't hold grudges.

46
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:39,208
He's got
a pair of Jack's.

47
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:41,911
Gimme your
fucking money.

48
00:03:44,213 --> 00:03:46,849
When I met him I feel like I'm
home, ya know what I'm saying?

49
00:03:46,882 --> 00:03:51,154
I feel like somebody... You
just get used to him so quickly

50
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,822
for some reason,
I don't know why.

51
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,693
he's been
through a lot, ya know.

52
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:59,328
Life definitely
hasn't been easy for him.

53
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,832
I'm getting emotional.

54
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:06,302
I feel like he puts up a front
or tells his jokes

55
00:04:06,336 --> 00:04:10,006
or tries to be the tough
guy, but... He's a sweetheart.

56
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:19,749
It's something
that happened to me so long ago.

57
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:23,420
Are you fine with it all coming
back up again? Because you...

58
00:04:23,453 --> 00:04:25,789
I don't know... because I did the
show <i>Locked up Abroad</i>,

59
00:04:25,821 --> 00:04:28,458
it's constantly
thrown back in my face again.

60
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:32,996
And I'm constantly
having to justify what uh,

61
00:04:33,028 --> 00:04:35,766
in people's words,
I "claim" happened.

62
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:37,267
I think it would
be really good closure

63
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,170
to tell your story
in your own words,

64
00:04:40,203 --> 00:04:42,106
and then
it's almost like...

65
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:45,742
you get the last word because
you got to tell the truth,

66
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:48,045
and I think
that's important.

67
00:04:49,412 --> 00:04:52,783
At least this way
everyone can kinda see how I am

68
00:04:52,816 --> 00:04:54,785
and why I am
the way that I am.

69
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:06,997
I'm the youngest
of six boys... no sisters.

70
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,965
Peter's my
only full brother.

71
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:13,804
Um... When my mom met my dad
she had Peter and myself

72
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:18,141
but uh my dad and her
just couldn't get along

73
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,812
and ya know, she painted
a really bad picture of my dad

74
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:25,148
So I really didn't have a<i>
great relationship with my dad.</i>

75
00:05:25,182 --> 00:05:27,316
Jeff and Michael are
my mom's first two kids.

76
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,956
They... they
had it kind of bad.

77
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:41,430
- There we go.<i>
- Hey, how are ya?</i>

78
00:05:41,463 --> 00:05:44,400
I'm good, we finally meet!
I feel like I know you.

79
00:05:45,434 --> 00:05:49,305
Can you tell me your full name
and your relationship to Erik?

80
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:51,141
<i>My name
is Jeffrey Farneski</i>

81
00:05:51,174 --> 00:05:53,143
<i>and I'm
Erik's birth brother.</i>

82
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:55,812
<i>I'm under
Michael and above Peter</i>

83
00:05:55,845 --> 00:05:57,581
<i>and then
Erik's the youngest.</i>

84
00:05:57,614 --> 00:05:59,917
I know you guys were spread
out, but if you can tell us

85
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:03,152
what your relationship
was like when you were kids.

86
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:05,189
<i>We
actually didn't have one.</i>

87
00:06:05,222 --> 00:06:08,258
<i>Out of the children
that Sherry, our mother, had,</i>

88
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,459
<i>I was the only one
placed up for adoption.</i>

89
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:15,365
<i>So I actually found out
about Erik when I was 18.</i>

90
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,536
My mom was...
you know she was young,

91
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,237
but she also wasn't...

92
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:24,942
She wasn't the best idea of
a mother, I guess you could say.

93
00:06:29,912 --> 00:06:31,047
<i>Hello?</i>

94
00:06:31,081 --> 00:06:32,482
Hi, Sherry?

95
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,019
<i>Who's
calling for her, please?</i>

96
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:39,189
This is Jamielyn Lippman.
I'm a friend of your son Erik's

97
00:06:39,222 --> 00:06:41,458
and I'm also a filmmaker.

98
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,592
<i>Your
name again, please.</i>

99
00:06:42,626 --> 00:06:44,895
Jamielyn.

100
00:06:44,927 --> 00:06:46,596
- <i>Hi, Jamie.</i>
- Hi, how are you?

101
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:49,432
<i>I'm doing
very well, thank you.</i>

102
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:52,569
Well I wanted to call you
because I'm making a documentary

103
00:06:52,602 --> 00:06:55,505
about Erik and I wanted
to see about coming out there

104
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:56,874
to interview you.

105
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:00,977
<i>Does
Erik know about this?</i>

106
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:02,011
He does.

107
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:06,582
<i>Has he given you
permission to speak with me?</i>

108
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:08,351
Yes.

109
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:10,353
<i>OK, fine.
I'll only say this:</i>

110
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,288
<i>Erik is totally innocent.</i>

111
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:14,658
<i>I will tell you that now.
He is totally innocent.</i>

112
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:20,397
<i>I'll put my hand on a bible
and stand before God about that.</i>

113
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,402
<i>I'll do anything for him.</i>

114
00:07:35,078 --> 00:07:42,386
Sherry was involved
in her own aspirations

115
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,123
and Erik kinda
went and did his thing.

116
00:07:46,155 --> 00:07:48,292
And I was usually
out in the garage.

117
00:07:48,324 --> 00:07:53,663
Right before seventh grade,
I was twelve years old.

118
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:55,699
and <i>Lethal Weapon</i> had come...

119
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:58,936
<i>Lethal Weapon 3</i> was
being filmed up in Lancaster

120
00:07:58,968 --> 00:07:59,969
at this old housing track.

121
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:01,504
So Merle brought me there

122
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,674
and he says: "Erik come
back in twenty minutes."

123
00:08:03,706 --> 00:08:05,708
I stayed there for a
couple hours that night.

124
00:08:05,742 --> 00:08:07,544
I knew I
was gonna get in trouble.

125
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:11,581
We saw the aftermath
and saw the whole movie set

126
00:08:11,614 --> 00:08:13,383
and how
things are laid out

127
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:15,651
and how things are done,

128
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:17,987
and I guess that
put the hook in him.

129
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,625
Growing up I liked to watch
Jean-Claude van Damme movies,

130
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:24,293
Arnold
Schwarzenegger movies,

131
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:25,728
and I wanted to be
those guys growing up.

132
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:28,999
I wanted to be a stuntman
my whole life.

133
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:31,201
Tunnel vision, ya know
if that's what he wants to do,

134
00:08:31,234 --> 00:08:32,569
then that's
what he's gonna do.

135
00:08:32,602 --> 00:08:36,307
He's got his own
set of principles.

136
00:08:45,482 --> 00:08:47,016
I was
the kind of kid

137
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,651
that you kept
your kids away from.

138
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:52,321
I was an asshole,
I was a brat, I was a smartass,

139
00:08:52,354 --> 00:08:55,257
and it's my mouth that
got me into a lot of fights.

140
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,194
I was not athletic
sports-wise. I was terrible.

141
00:08:57,227 --> 00:09:01,264
I tried basketball,
I sat the bench...

142
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:03,300
I didn't play football
until I got into high school

143
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:06,336
but the only reason
I wanted to play football...

144
00:09:06,368 --> 00:09:07,771
The only reason
I wanted to play football

145
00:09:07,804 --> 00:09:09,173
was because
I liked to hit.

146
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:25,222
As a football coach
I'm gonna get

147
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,024
a lot of
different personalities,

148
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,425
and I'm gonna have the
opportunity to work with

149
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:29,559
a lot of different guys.

150
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:31,261
but Erik was always somebody

151
00:09:31,294 --> 00:09:34,731
I think that respected me

152
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:37,768
enough to
listen to my advice.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,437
And I think that
really helped us become close.

154
00:09:41,471 --> 00:09:47,511
And to this day
we're close friends.

155
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,646
To this day I
hold a California record.

156
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:52,782
It's stood since 1996.

157
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:55,819
Even though I played
for a very small school,

158
00:09:55,852 --> 00:09:59,790
my record of "the most tackles
by a defensive end" stands.

159
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:01,792
I had 147 tackles.
I wanted to play football

160
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:06,429
but I wanted to act
and do stunts even more.

161
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,400
And I was doing little shows
when I was still in high school.

162
00:10:11,434 --> 00:10:15,204
But the second I turned 18,
I moved out of the house

163
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,074
and I tried to
get down to Hollywood.

164
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,782
During this time
I was still auditioning,

165
00:10:25,814 --> 00:10:28,584
I was booking some shows here.
I booked a big WB show.

166
00:10:28,617 --> 00:10:30,352
I was doing Nickelodeon shows.

167
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,823
I was always doing
co-stars and small reoccuring...

168
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:37,726
He got so much work
it was crazy.

169
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,130
I mean Erik was
very aggressive,

170
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:41,832
and he knew what he wanted
and he would go for it.

171
00:10:41,865 --> 00:10:43,467
He would not give up.

172
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,501
And he had friends
that were directors.

173
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:47,304
He would call them
and get parts.

174
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:50,207
And he just loved
to be in front of a camera.

175
00:10:51,574 --> 00:10:54,310
I met Erik on an
episode of <i>Cousin Skeeter.</i>

176
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:56,612
It was a tv show I was
doing for Nickelodeon

177
00:10:56,646 --> 00:10:58,448
and he came
on as a guest star,

178
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:01,852
and I remember thinking
"This guy's crazy".

179
00:11:01,885 --> 00:11:04,154
He was just super awesome,

180
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:07,356
full of energy,
willing to try and do anything

181
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,692
and we just
got really close.

182
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,697
Even though yes, I was starting
to become a working actor,

183
00:11:13,729 --> 00:11:16,398
I still needed a side job
to make ends meet

184
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:19,335
because working as an actor
maybe once every month

185
00:11:19,368 --> 00:11:21,637
or every other month
just doesn't pay the bills.

186
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:24,373
So I always had jobs.
I was a security guard

187
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,644
and I got asked to be
the night time manager

188
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:31,147
at a local gym called
World Gym in Burbank.

189
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,315
He's always talking,
he loves to talk.

190
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:36,386
Sometimes I tell him "Erik,
you don't know these people".

191
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,388
He's like: "Hey, you gonna
practice this and that

192
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,422
you have
to know everybody."

193
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:42,725
It's good because you never
know who you're talking to.

194
00:11:42,758 --> 00:11:45,227
So when you're on the front,

195
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:50,232
it's like easy access
or easy victim

196
00:11:50,266 --> 00:11:52,769
for people to get to you.

197
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,336
Because you work
in the front desk,

198
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,372
anybody can
come and talk to you,

199
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,307
you know what I'm saying?

200
00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:00,343
That's how that
incident started. Yeah.

201
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,585
Wait,
Erik let me ask you:

202
00:12:09,618 --> 00:12:10,887
When's the last time
that you came here?

203
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,823
2005 I
got asked to come here

204
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,525
and show somebody
the place.

205
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,928
so it's
now a new gym, correct?

206
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,528
Like it's not
the same it was before

207
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:21,430
but do the people
that had worked there

208
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:23,833
and the owners did they
know everything that happened?

209
00:12:23,866 --> 00:12:26,770
I haven't talked or
spoken to any of them since.

210
00:12:26,803 --> 00:12:29,338
When you came here
in 2005, what was it like?

211
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:31,974
Did it bring back...
How did you feel emotionally?

212
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:35,344
Did it bring back memories?
Was it hard? Did you go inside?

213
00:12:35,377 --> 00:12:36,879
Yeah, I went inside, went
downstairs,

214
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:38,515
and saw them working out.
I'm not the kinda guy

215
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:39,950
who's gonna be like
"oh no this is not

216
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:41,650
where I want to
be and bad memories".

217
00:12:41,684 --> 00:12:45,956
I mean my entire life
has not been a cake walk

218
00:12:45,988 --> 00:12:47,723
So I've been used to
this kind of crap.

219
00:12:47,756 --> 00:12:50,327
If something bad happens,
I laugh it off.

220
00:12:50,359 --> 00:12:53,429
OK, let's go...
let's see if we can go in.

221
00:13:01,603 --> 00:13:02,905
I became
a personal trainer

222
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:04,908
for a lot of the
people that came in.

223
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,343
I would work out with them
and teach them how to use

224
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:10,780
the equipment the right way.

225
00:13:10,813 --> 00:13:15,418
Guy named Rai Ghazarian was
an Armenian in his mid-thirties.

226
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:17,519
He was always
paying me to work out

227
00:13:17,553 --> 00:13:19,856
and we were working out
four days a week together.

228
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:22,425
I was training him
probably nine months.

229
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:25,462
We became very good friends.

230
00:13:25,495 --> 00:13:27,497
when you're friends, you're
guys, you talk about everything.

231
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:30,333
You talk about girls. You talk
about the hot girls in the gym.

232
00:13:30,366 --> 00:13:32,736
You talk about stupid shit,
movies, sports.

233
00:13:33,636 --> 00:13:35,972
And something that
he had started to trying

234
00:13:36,005 --> 00:13:38,942
to get me into, which
several other people at the gym

235
00:13:38,974 --> 00:13:40,743
had been doing themselves.

236
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:43,979
He would have young people
in their late teens,

237
00:13:44,012 --> 00:13:46,548
early twenties,
travel around the world

238
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:48,051
importing
expensive leather goods

239
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:49,752
and then
paying them for it.

240
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,621
And it sounded
like a dream job.

241
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,056
I'd never been
out of the country.

242
00:13:53,088 --> 00:13:56,292
I'd only been to
a couple different states.

243
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:01,030
But it's all changed.
This wasn't here.

244
00:14:01,064 --> 00:14:03,833
It was... all the
ellipticals were right here

245
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:08,038
and Rai would usually be
right here watching the TV's.

246
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,606
It wasn't him who told me
about it first, though,

247
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,910
It was Arra.

248
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:15,845
It was another guy
that was making these trips.

249
00:14:15,877 --> 00:14:18,348
Another young guy making these
trips told me about it.

250
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:21,617
I knew him for a long time
before I finally went on a trip.

251
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,853
I had a lot of questions,
I asked a lot of questions.

252
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,622
But I saw him
as a friend long before

253
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:28,324
I ever decided
to work with him.

254
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,308
hopefully he will
say yes.

255
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:48,545
<i>The person
you have called is unavailable</i>

256
00:14:48,578 --> 00:14:50,713
<i>right now.
Please try again later</i>.

257
00:14:51,747 --> 00:14:53,650
His phone's off.
Or a new number...

258
00:14:53,683 --> 00:14:56,720
Is unavailable usually
disconnected or is that...

259
00:14:56,752 --> 00:14:58,687
Can be both.
Or he didn't pay his bill.

260
00:14:58,721 --> 00:15:01,725
They haven't paid their bill,
it might just be a go phone.

261
00:15:01,757 --> 00:15:05,027
Let me just call back to
make sure I did that right.

262
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,829
It sounded too good to be
true. "Is that

263
00:15:06,862 --> 00:15:08,665
all you guys are
bringing?"

264
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:11,400
I said: "Why don't you
just mail the stuff back?"

265
00:15:11,434 --> 00:15:13,136
He says: "If I have it mailed
back I have to pay

266
00:15:13,169 --> 00:15:16,639
55% import tax for them."
By sending someone over

267
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:19,475
I save anywhere between
13,000 to 14,000 dollars.

268
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:22,010
"What happens if they catch
you with the leather goods,

269
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:23,813
will you go
to jail for that?"

270
00:15:23,846 --> 00:15:25,415
He's like:
"No, it's just a fine."

271
00:15:25,448 --> 00:15:27,083
I wasn't convinced, though.

272
00:15:27,116 --> 00:15:29,919
So my mom put me in touch
with one of her friends

273
00:15:29,952 --> 00:15:31,855
who worked for the FBI

274
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:33,655
and my question to him was:

275
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:36,126
"Will I go to jail
if I get caught doing this?"

276
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:41,131
He goes: "No, you won't go to
jail, but it's frowned upon.

277
00:15:41,164 --> 00:15:43,633
They'll confiscate it
and give you a fine."

278
00:15:43,665 --> 00:15:45,034
"So I won't go to jail?"

279
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,602
"No, it's like
a jaywalking ticket."

280
00:15:46,636 --> 00:15:48,538
That's how
he explained it to me.

281
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,540
And that made my decision.

282
00:15:50,573 --> 00:15:52,574
He came over to my mom's house
and he was getting ready

283
00:15:52,607 --> 00:15:54,977
to go to Turkey
and he was super excited

284
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:56,980
because he's
an adventurous person.

285
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:59,181
And he was like:
"Dude, I got this job,

286
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:02,050
I can totally... I'm importing
leathers and I get to travel

287
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,420
and everything is paid for
and it's just awesome."

288
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:07,156
And ya know we were kids
So we didn't think anything.

289
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:08,857
We just thought
like wow this is amazing!

290
00:16:08,891 --> 00:16:10,693
And he's like:
"Do you want to come?"

291
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:12,562
And I'm like:
"Hell yeah, I want to come!"

292
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:14,596
At the time I was working
So I couldn't go,

293
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:17,100
But I remember just
being really excited for him

294
00:16:17,132 --> 00:16:19,602
that he had found this other
job besides working at the gym.

295
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,910
He
was my last child

296
00:16:26,943 --> 00:16:30,612
and the day that I had him
I never had one contraction.

297
00:16:30,646 --> 00:16:34,684
Not one. he let
me know he was coming

298
00:16:34,717 --> 00:16:37,020
and 45 minutes later
he was born.

299
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:44,593
He's always been
pretty inquisitive,

300
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:50,467
but between school, football,
movie industry, cars,

301
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,039
helping other people.

302
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:03,879
I think I
over-protected him.

303
00:17:06,115 --> 00:17:07,916
I wished I'd
let him go out

304
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:13,690
and learn the world, but
I didn't want him to get hurt.

305
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,695
So he was ripe picking
for wolf in sheep's clothing.

306
00:17:23,765 --> 00:17:25,200
You never think
something like this

307
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,236
could ever
happen to anyone.

308
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,937
It only happens in movies.

309
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,540
It doesn't happen
to people in real life.

310
00:17:31,573 --> 00:17:33,942
But uh...

311
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:38,747
I learned
the hard way that...

312
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,050
I learned the hard way
that uh this stuff does happen

313
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:45,889
and it would...

314
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:52,562
cost me more than
I could ever imagine.

315
00:17:52,595 --> 00:17:55,565
I would go to jail
for a crime I didn't commit

316
00:17:55,598 --> 00:17:56,899
and I would
come out a murderer.

317
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:05,808
There's so much
to see in Turkey.

318
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,976
Turkey's a
beautiful country.

319
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,846
Istanbul is just amazing.

320
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:11,548
I was there for a few days.

321
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,215
I felt big,
I didn't feel small anymore

322
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:16,052
because I was
experiencing life.

323
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:17,921
Traveling is amazing
and I love it.

324
00:18:30,633 --> 00:18:32,235
when I
landed in Stockholm,

325
00:18:32,268 --> 00:18:35,305
they had a drug sniffing dog
sniffing everyone's bags.

326
00:18:37,239 --> 00:18:39,208
The dog pulled me out,
but it wasn't

327
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,944
just pulling me out it was
pulling people out at random.

328
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:45,982
Ny imagination was
like uh I got screwed.

329
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:50,018
This is <i>Brokedown Palace,
Midnight Express</i>...

330
00:18:50,051 --> 00:18:53,322
They went through everything,
all the jackets, found nothing.

331
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:55,124
Everything was fine

332
00:18:55,156 --> 00:18:56,759
and they were like:
"Alright you're good to go."

333
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:59,061
And I was: "Okay!"
So now I was like:

334
00:18:59,095 --> 00:19:00,230
"Alright this
is the most legit job ever!"

335
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,301
Rai was
there waiting for me.

336
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:08,271
He picked me up
from the airport.

337
00:19:08,303 --> 00:19:10,172
The whole way to my house
he was telling me

338
00:19:10,205 --> 00:19:11,907
"See! Did you have a great
time?" "I had a great time".

339
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:13,242
He's like:
"What did you do?"

340
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:15,043
And I was
telling him about my trip.

341
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:17,914
When we got
to my apartment

342
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,648
we brought the
leather cases in

343
00:19:19,682 --> 00:19:21,351
and I showed him
everything.

344
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:23,653
It all seemed copacetic.

345
00:19:23,685 --> 00:19:25,253
He was happy
with everything

346
00:19:25,287 --> 00:19:28,024
and he paid me eight-hundred
dollars right there.

347
00:19:28,057 --> 00:19:30,326
And I thought: "Wow,
this is the best job ever".

348
00:19:30,358 --> 00:19:32,227
He asked me
"When can I go again?"

349
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:36,366
He wanted me to go literally
in like the next month.

350
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:39,034
I started filming the
movie <i>The Scorpion King</i>,

351
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:42,838
and I was working on
that movie as a as a stuntman.

352
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:46,175
So I said: "I can't
I'm working on a movie."

353
00:19:46,207 --> 00:19:49,378
And I was getting a lot
of acting jobs at this time

354
00:19:49,412 --> 00:19:51,681
but I wanted to
keep this opportunity open.

355
00:19:51,713 --> 00:19:53,081
I didn't want to lose it.

356
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:55,117
I wanted to go on
more trips in the future.

357
00:19:55,151 --> 00:19:59,222
So what I started to do was to
encourage this job to everyone,

358
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,357
to my friends, my family...

359
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,792
Hell, I even
encouraged it to my mother.

360
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:06,695
<i>Yeah, he told all of us about
it. I knew about it,</i>

361
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:08,698
<i>my girlfriend
at the time knew about it,</i>

362
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:10,800
<i>our brother Michael
knew about it, his wife.</i>

363
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:12,300
<i>Everybody knew.</i>

364
00:20:12,334 --> 00:20:14,771
<i>This was a guy
that was at his gym.</i>

365
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:17,939
<i>He used to train him.</i>

366
00:20:17,973 --> 00:20:20,175
<i>Rai was a buddy of his.
We all heard about him.</i>

367
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:29,217
September 11th happens...

368
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:34,156
And it was a big
wake-up call for America.

369
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:38,928
And no one wanted to go
on any trips understandably.

370
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:40,896
No one wanted to go
on any trips anymore.

371
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:45,901
My brother Peter,

372
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,369
when I told him
about these trips,

373
00:20:47,403 --> 00:20:49,338
he actually
reached out to me.

374
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,306
He wanted to go
on one of these trips.

375
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:53,443
He said: "Yeah, I could
absolutely use 800 dollars,

376
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:59,114
that would be awesome."
So I set him up with Rai.

377
00:21:03,351 --> 00:21:05,088
I get a call
from Rai. He tells me:

378
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,189
"Peter says:
he's not going,

379
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:08,825
and I put a lot
of money into this,

380
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:10,457
it's putting me
in a really bad spot,

381
00:21:10,459 --> 00:21:11,828
you need to talk to him."

382
00:21:12,828 --> 00:21:14,196
I said:
"Alright I'll call him."

383
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,865
Because this is
making me look bad.

384
00:21:15,897 --> 00:21:17,332
I vouched for Peter
and he's backing out

385
00:21:17,366 --> 00:21:19,202
and I didn't
understand why.

386
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,136
So I called Peter and
he just matter-of-factly goes:

387
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:23,371
"Yeah, Erik
I'm not going."

388
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:25,374
and he wasn't explaining
why he wasn't going.

389
00:21:25,406 --> 00:21:27,376
I'm like: "Why? Peter you're
making me look like a dick."

390
00:21:27,408 --> 00:21:30,946
He's like: "I'm not going over
there, it's not gonna happen."

391
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,117
I go: "Why?"
"Because it's dangerous."

392
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:36,051
I say: "You have nothing to
worry about.

393
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:38,788
Turkey's a great country."
He says: "It's not to Turkey,

394
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,090
it's to Pakistan." I said: "What
are you talking about?"

395
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:43,760
"Cause yeah, Rai's
saying it's to Pakistan,

396
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:45,828
I'm not
going to Pakistan."

397
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,396
And now I agreed with Peter.
I agreed with Peter.

398
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,333
I said: "No you're
not going to Pakistan."

399
00:21:50,366 --> 00:21:53,035
I can vouch for Turkey because
I've been there twice now,

400
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:56,472
but I've never been to Pakistan
So I can't vouch for Pakistan.

401
00:21:56,504 --> 00:21:58,006
So I call Rai
"What the hell is going on?

402
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,809
Peter's saying it's to
Pakistan."

403
00:21:59,841 --> 00:22:01,444
Yeah, I've got a really
good deal over there."

404
00:22:01,476 --> 00:22:04,179
"Whoa no! You didn't tell me
it was to Pakistan.

405
00:22:04,213 --> 00:22:05,115
Peter doesn't want to go."

406
00:22:06,148 --> 00:22:07,883
He says: "Look I've
already set everything up.

407
00:22:07,916 --> 00:22:09,851
I've spent
a lot of money on this.

408
00:22:09,885 --> 00:22:12,054
If your brother backs out now,
I will lose a lot of money."

409
00:22:12,087 --> 00:22:13,321
Rai started making me feel
really bad, and Peter wasn't

410
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:14,991
gonna go.
He didn't want to go.

411
00:22:15,023 --> 00:22:15,992
He had his mind set up.

412
00:22:16,992 --> 00:22:19,227
And I didn't want to
let my friend Rai down.

413
00:22:19,261 --> 00:22:24,133
So even though I had no time,
I took the trip.

414
00:22:24,165 --> 00:22:27,136
I took the trip.
And I'm glad I did.

415
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:29,204
I'm glad what was
about to happen to me

416
00:22:30,973 --> 00:22:33,777
would happen to me rather
than someone else because of me.

417
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:14,082
I walk
out of the airport

418
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:15,550
to where all
the visitors are

419
00:23:15,584 --> 00:23:17,486
and there's a guy there

420
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,122
with a napkin that
has my name written on it.

421
00:23:20,155 --> 00:23:21,324
He says to me
right then and there:

422
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,225
"Hey man, Rai messed up."

423
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:25,027
I go: "What do you mean
he messed up?"

424
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:27,230
He goes: "You were
supposed to come to Karachi."

425
00:23:27,262 --> 00:23:28,997
I go: "Okay, where's that?"

426
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:33,034
Karachi's eight hour drive
south of Islamabad.

427
00:23:33,068 --> 00:23:34,871
I'm in Islamabad

428
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:39,909
and Karachi is a couple hour
flight from Islamabad.

429
00:23:39,942 --> 00:23:41,077
So I said:
"What does that mean?"

430
00:23:41,109 --> 00:23:43,311
"We got to go down there."

431
00:23:43,345 --> 00:23:44,947
I go: "Am I
coming with you?"

432
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:47,116
"No, we will put you up
in a hotel here."

433
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,217
And....first off,
they're telling me:

434
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:50,886
"By the way you don't
want to leave the hotel."

435
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:51,620
I'm like: "Why?"

436
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:54,122
"Because they don't
like Westerner's here."

437
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:55,390
I'm like: "What?"

438
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,359
First off
don't tell me that

439
00:23:57,393 --> 00:23:59,228
because I'm not
staying in a room for a week.

440
00:23:59,261 --> 00:24:01,497
That's not
at all an option.

441
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,268
And I decided
to do what I do.

442
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,471
I put on my jogging shorts,
my backpack, and my tank top

443
00:24:08,503 --> 00:24:11,473
and I went jogging through
the streets of Islamabad.

444
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:23,251
I got so many evil faces
so many angry stares,

445
00:24:23,284 --> 00:24:25,086
but I would
just smile and wave

446
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,989
and just
keep going because

447
00:24:28,357 --> 00:24:31,226
you don't want to
"mad dog" people back.

448
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,563
I don't want them to think
I'm dangerous or anything.

449
00:24:34,596 --> 00:24:36,332
I want them to know
I'm friendly

450
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:39,301
and hopefully they'll
be friendly towards me.

451
00:24:39,335 --> 00:24:42,238
But I don't talk to anyone
and I find an Internet cafe

452
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:44,339
just to see
who's emailed me.

453
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:47,409
There's one email that jumps out

454
00:24:47,443 --> 00:24:50,146
and it's an email from Missy.

455
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:52,280
It wasn't to me,
it was a group email

456
00:24:52,313 --> 00:24:55,450
telling me that her mother
had died from cancer.

457
00:24:58,686 --> 00:25:00,588
What happened
at that time?

458
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:05,293
<i>I remember sending out the
email. He wrote back.</i>

459
00:25:05,327 --> 00:25:08,330
<i>I believe he said something
like: "I'm so sorry. I love you.</i>

460
00:25:08,364 --> 00:25:10,031
<i>I'll be home soon."</i>

461
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,534
And when he had
sent you that email

462
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:16,005
was there...
I think on his end

463
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:21,143
the hope of him coming back
and maybe restarting that again

464
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:22,979
or seeing
where this could go?

465
00:25:23,745 --> 00:25:28,383
<i>That was definitely
something that was on the table.</i>

466
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:31,686
Missy was my motivation
in life,

467
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,422
for so many different things.
She was the reason

468
00:25:33,454 --> 00:25:35,390
I worked out hard, the reason
I studied longer,

469
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:38,426
the reason I wanted to
be very successful as an actor

470
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,732
just so I could
be on her radar.

471
00:25:42,764 --> 00:25:45,033
That night I go
back to the hotel.

472
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:47,269
I can't wait
to get on the flight.

473
00:25:47,301 --> 00:25:50,238
I have an early morning flight
it's around 6 a.m.

474
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:51,741
I get a call
from downstairs

475
00:25:51,773 --> 00:25:55,377
that one of the guys
are here to pick me up

476
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:57,446
and they want me
to come downstairs.

477
00:25:57,479 --> 00:25:59,749
That's not how it's
ever worked in Turkey, though.

478
00:25:59,781 --> 00:26:02,318
They always come upstairs,
let me go through everything.

479
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,386
I have to grade it.

480
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:08,423
Guy brings up one suitcase,
only one suitcase.

481
00:26:08,456 --> 00:26:11,092
So I call Rai immediately
from the hotel

482
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:14,797
and I say: "Hey
Rai... is this right?"

483
00:26:14,829 --> 00:26:17,500
I tell him it's one suitcase,
it's seven pieces.

484
00:26:17,532 --> 00:26:19,334
He goes,
"Yeah, that's right.

485
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,404
It's just a first trip
we want to see how it goes."

486
00:26:22,471 --> 00:26:25,107
Instead of being concerned,
I'm actually kind of happy.

487
00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:27,475
Cool, I don't have to carry all
this luggage anymore.

488
00:26:27,509 --> 00:26:30,279
I'm not going to have
to pay money at the airport

489
00:26:30,311 --> 00:26:32,380
because it's not that heavy."
So I'm kind of relieved.

490
00:26:32,414 --> 00:26:34,817
Alright, cool. It's just one
suitcase, at least that's nice.

491
00:26:34,849 --> 00:26:37,352
I take my suitcase,
I take my bag.

492
00:26:37,386 --> 00:26:40,689
I get up to the line
for international departures

493
00:26:40,722 --> 00:26:43,192
and I'm probably six inches
taller than the next person.

494
00:26:43,224 --> 00:26:45,627
Pakistani people
are very tiny.

495
00:26:45,661 --> 00:26:47,096
And this is a long line.

496
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:48,763
As soon as I get
around the corner

497
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:50,466
there's Customs up there.

498
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,104
A Customs Officer sees me
and waves me to the front.

499
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:57,839
I'm like: "Yes! Alright
it pays to be a foreigner."

500
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:01,444
I go and I skip this long line
and go up to the front

501
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:03,378
and I'm about to go
through the metal detectors

502
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:06,482
when someone grabs my arm.

503
00:27:06,514 --> 00:27:10,118
I turn around and
another guy comes up and says:

504
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:12,154
"You carrying narcotics?"

505
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:13,255
I said: "Check it again."

506
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:17,358
He takes the suitcase,
only my suitcase.

507
00:27:17,392 --> 00:27:19,828
Not my backpack, not my bag,
opens it up and throws

508
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:23,365
all the leather jackets and
clothes onto the floor.

509
00:27:23,397 --> 00:27:25,300
Now I'm pissed I'm like:
"Whoa! That's what I'm here for.

510
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:26,836
What the fuck?"

511
00:27:26,868 --> 00:27:28,503
He takes the suitcase
goes to another room.

512
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:29,572
Goes someplace else.

513
00:27:30,673 --> 00:27:33,175
I start folding up all
the clothes and everything.

514
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:36,611
And a guard takes me,
asks me to follow him.

515
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:38,881
I follow him while
folding up all the stuff.

516
00:27:38,914 --> 00:27:40,482
He comes back
into the room

517
00:27:40,515 --> 00:27:42,283
followed by a
guard who's in uniform

518
00:27:42,317 --> 00:27:47,522
holding two
thin sealed patches

519
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:49,859
and he says:
"What is this?"

520
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,894
I said: "He's
holding it." Meaning like

521
00:27:51,926 --> 00:27:54,762
he is the one who's holding it,
so he should know what it is.

522
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:56,199
He goes: "This is opium."

523
00:28:00,234 --> 00:28:01,736
I said: "Why are
you showing me this?"

524
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:05,407
He says: "It came
out of your luggage."

525
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:33,169
I got a phone call from the
American embassy and Islamabad

526
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:39,275
Pakistan saying
that my son Erik has been

527
00:28:39,308 --> 00:28:41,344
arrested for
drug smuggling

528
00:28:43,478 --> 00:28:46,782
and he was
facing death by hanging.

529
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:49,785
And I'm going: "No! no!"

530
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:52,788
You know we Americans
are so innocent, so naÃ¯ve.

531
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,256
So protected.

532
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:57,960
I'm going: "No! No!

533
00:28:57,992 --> 00:29:01,463
Here I got this number
it's Frank Azaria

534
00:29:01,495 --> 00:29:04,432
and he hired him."
You know. I just...

535
00:29:10,606 --> 00:29:13,909
I let myself in, called up, say:
"Hey, Sherry I'm here."

536
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:17,713
I go in and I see all these maps
of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

537
00:29:17,745 --> 00:29:20,748
And she comes down says:
"What do you think of that?"

538
00:29:20,781 --> 00:29:22,318
I say, "What do I think?

539
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,588
What do you have
these on your table for?"

540
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,657
She goes:
"Erik's in prison."

541
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:31,527
And it's just like
someone comes up and goes

542
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,495
boom right in the chest.

543
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:36,365
I sit down and I get back up
and I'm like:

544
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:41,369
"What?" She goes: "Erik's
in prison for drug smuggling."

545
00:29:43,871 --> 00:29:49,677
And I think I just
looked at her for awhile

546
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:53,549
you got puppy-dog-cookie-head
like:

547
00:29:53,581 --> 00:29:57,986
"Where are the cameras and
when is the joke gonna be over?"

548
00:30:03,892 --> 00:30:05,694
I got hit
in the head by a rifle

549
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:09,564
and I got dragged off
to a customs lock-up.

550
00:30:09,598 --> 00:30:12,401
I know I'm innocent. A lot of
people know I'm innocent.

551
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:14,869
So I'm thinking
this will blow over

552
00:30:14,903 --> 00:30:17,306
once they know I'm innocent.
I'm going to be out of here

553
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:18,840
maybe in a couple days.

554
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:20,876
There's no way
they're going to keep me here.

555
00:30:20,908 --> 00:30:24,879
So I'm taking photos, and I'm posing
for these photos because this is

556
00:30:24,913 --> 00:30:26,815
it's a fucking joke
in my eyes.

557
00:30:26,848 --> 00:30:28,517
There's no way they're going to
keep me here because

558
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:31,353
innocent people
don't fucking stay

559
00:30:31,386 --> 00:30:33,655
in bad situations
like that, they just don't.

560
00:30:33,688 --> 00:30:35,757
That's what I believed.

561
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:38,594
The embassy consulate,
this girl named Christy Agor

562
00:30:38,626 --> 00:30:40,628
tells me they're going to
put me in front of

563
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:42,431
a lower court magistrate

564
00:30:42,463 --> 00:30:43,799
who's going to decide

565
00:30:43,831 --> 00:30:45,967
how many days of
physical remand I get.

566
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:48,503
And I go: "What
does that even mean?"

567
00:30:48,537 --> 00:30:49,938
She goes, "Well
here in Pakistan they have

568
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:51,640
something
called physical remand.

569
00:30:51,673 --> 00:30:56,377
It's where they think
that by beating you

570
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,780
you're going to
tell them the truth."

571
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:07,423
The customs
police came and got me

572
00:31:07,455 --> 00:31:10,457
and took me in a vehicle

573
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:12,561
to another part of town

574
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:14,997
maybe only twenty
or thirty minutes away.

575
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,401
Christy comes forward
and talks to the judge in Urdu.

576
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:21,703
As we're walking away,
she's telling me what happened.

577
00:31:21,736 --> 00:31:24,505
"What happened?" She goes:
"The judge wanted ten days.

578
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:25,741
I got you three."

579
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:36,385
What's going on is

580
00:31:36,417 --> 00:31:38,553
we're preparing
for flashback scenes

581
00:31:38,587 --> 00:31:40,088
for this documentary.

582
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:41,589
Jamie wants to...

583
00:31:42,758 --> 00:31:44,894
Jamie wants to
recreate as much as possible.

584
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:49,865
We've got a talented actor
to play me.

585
00:31:49,897 --> 00:31:52,600
I don't play
twenty-one anymore

586
00:31:52,634 --> 00:31:56,070
and even if I could, I
wouldn't want to do this again.

587
00:31:56,104 --> 00:32:01,777
Just gonna be a fun
two days of awesome memories.

588
00:32:55,797 --> 00:32:57,133
<i>Salam alaikum</i>.

589
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,823
What's your name?

590
00:33:57,058 --> 00:33:58,194
Erik AudÃ©.

591
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:09,504
And how old
are you, Mr. AudÃ©?

592
00:34:11,272 --> 00:34:12,540
21.

593
00:34:16,678 --> 00:34:18,080
Where are you from?

594
00:34:19,881 --> 00:34:21,716
America. You do know

595
00:34:21,749 --> 00:34:23,885
that I've been asked
these questions already, right?

596
00:34:27,988 --> 00:34:31,993
And what is it that
you do in... America?

597
00:34:33,995 --> 00:34:35,597
I'm an actor.

598
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:38,066
Actor.

599
00:34:38,098 --> 00:34:39,200
Hollywood.

600
00:34:43,838 --> 00:34:45,807
Who give you
the drugs Mr. Actor?

601
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,678
I didn't get any drugs.

602
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:07,729
Again, who
gave you the drugs?

603
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:11,232
Nobody. I didn't get any drugs.

604
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:19,707
Wait...

605
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:27,616
I'm telling you...

606
00:35:27,649 --> 00:35:30,553
I'm innocent.
I'm telling you the truth.

607
00:35:31,819 --> 00:35:33,789
I'm telling you the truth.
I'm innocent.

608
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:39,761
I'm telling you
everything I know.

609
00:35:47,368 --> 00:35:51,106
I'm telling you...
I'm innocent.

610
00:35:52,106 --> 00:35:54,142
Everyone starts out
saying that.

611
00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,014
So Mr. AudÃ©, where
did you buy the drugs from?

612
00:36:02,082 --> 00:36:03,918
I didn't get any drugs.

613
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:07,256
I'm telling you the truth.

614
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,029
You don't have to do that.

615
00:36:14,062 --> 00:36:15,864
I'll tell you
everything I know.

616
00:36:15,897 --> 00:36:18,165
I've told you everything,
there's nothing else to say.

617
00:36:18,198 --> 00:36:19,967
- I'm telling you the truth.
- The truth.

618
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:21,970
Please, I'm
telling you the truth. Please.

619
00:36:22,002 --> 00:36:23,338
Please.

620
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,807
Please!

621
00:36:28,276 --> 00:36:30,712
Fuck! Please, please.

622
00:36:30,745 --> 00:36:33,781
I'm telling you the truth.
I don't know anything else!

623
00:36:37,252 --> 00:36:38,621
Fuck!

624
00:36:44,292 --> 00:36:48,263
I
need you to listen to me.

625
00:36:48,296 --> 00:36:51,366
This guy sent me here
to pick up some leather goods

626
00:36:51,399 --> 00:36:54,202
for him and bring them back
that's all I know. I don't...

627
00:36:54,234 --> 00:36:55,970
I don't know
anything about any drugs.

628
00:36:56,004 --> 00:36:59,141
I swear to you.
I swear to God.

629
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:04,912
You know, I've never tortured
a Hollywood movie star before.

630
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:08,751
I'm going to enjoy this.

631
00:37:11,118 --> 00:37:12,120
Please.

632
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:19,261
Who gave you the drugs?

633
00:37:19,294 --> 00:37:21,396
Fuck. I'm telling
you the fucking truth.

634
00:37:21,428 --> 00:37:24,365
Rai, Rai Ghazarian!

635
00:37:24,399 --> 00:37:25,901
Gay Gazar...
Where does he live?

636
00:37:25,934 --> 00:37:28,836
I don't know, okay?
Los Angeles.

637
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,874
I need a name in Pakistan!
An address! A phone number!

638
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:34,376
I don't have any.
At the hotel...

639
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,111
How did he look like?
Was he tall? Short?

640
00:37:36,144 --> 00:37:37,745
- He looked fucking Pakistani!
- Pakistani?

641
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:38,914
- Yes!
- Give me a phone number

642
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:40,281
I don't...

643
00:39:02,897 --> 00:39:03,899
No!

644
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:55,349
Because I'm innocent,
I had no right answers for them.

645
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:01,456
So...

646
00:40:04,658 --> 00:40:08,030
So nothing I say
is going to make them stop.

647
00:40:13,401 --> 00:40:15,502
That sick son of a bitch
upstairs

648
00:40:15,535 --> 00:40:19,240
who some of us call God,
it's like he's been preparing me

649
00:40:19,274 --> 00:40:25,080
my whole life
for this situation.

650
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:27,216
Just months before the
show <i>Fear Factor</i> had come out

651
00:40:29,249 --> 00:40:31,518
and the first
episode I ever watched

652
00:40:31,551 --> 00:40:33,655
the person who
won 50,000 dollars,

653
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:35,423
won because he could hold his
breath

654
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:39,560
for a minute and 13 seconds.

655
00:40:39,593 --> 00:40:41,662
After I saw
that episode I said:

656
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:45,667
"You know, I'm going to go
and get myself on <i>Fear Factor</i> ."

657
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,504
I would practice at night
to hold my breath.

658
00:40:49,537 --> 00:40:51,506
I would hold my breath
when I got in the shower.

659
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:53,441
When I was at a stoplight.

660
00:40:53,473 --> 00:40:55,276
Before I went to bed.

661
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:57,045
And I got it to where
I could hold my breath

662
00:40:57,077 --> 00:40:58,280
for almost three minutes.

663
00:40:59,546 --> 00:41:02,383
Now here I am being
dunked by these guys

664
00:41:02,417 --> 00:41:04,119
and they're
keeping me under at least

665
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:05,186
a minute
to a minute and a half.

666
00:41:06,354 --> 00:41:09,191
I didn't want them to know
how easy it was for me.

667
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:14,663
But I'm thinking to myself
had I not seen that damn show.

668
00:41:14,696 --> 00:41:16,932
I would be in a lot
of trouble right now.

669
00:43:29,263 --> 00:43:31,098
Do you have anything
you wish to tell me?

670
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,309
You are torturing
an innocent man.

671
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:25,720
Hollywood.

672
00:44:26,854 --> 00:44:30,658
Just tell me the drugs
are yours, this will be over.

673
00:44:39,167 --> 00:44:40,401
No.

674
00:44:40,434 --> 00:44:42,202
Erik
had the physique.

675
00:44:42,236 --> 00:44:45,839
He had the discipline,
he had the pain tolerance.

676
00:44:45,872 --> 00:44:51,545
Because of
Erik's bus accident

677
00:44:51,578 --> 00:44:53,414
he learned to
deal with pain.

678
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:56,184
Because Erik lives
in pain every day.

679
00:44:56,216 --> 00:44:57,684
<i>I was run over
by a school bus.</i>

680
00:44:57,718 --> 00:44:59,521
<i>I was eight years old</i>

681
00:44:59,553 --> 00:45:03,590
<i>and the two back rear tires
ran over my pelvis.</i>

682
00:45:03,624 --> 00:45:05,827
<i>It shattered my pelvis
like a glass jar.</i>

683
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:11,665
<i>I wouldn't be able to walk again
for a couple years.</i>

684
00:45:11,698 --> 00:45:14,168
<i>When I got home
from the hospital</i>

685
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:17,171
<i>I had these...
the worst kidney pains.</i>

686
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:22,377
<i>I started feeling bad for</i>
being a nuisance to everyone

687
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,879
when I screamed because they
couldn't do anything for me.

688
00:45:25,912 --> 00:45:27,548
So I would start to...

689
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:31,819
I would start to force
myself to scream in silence.

690
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,426
He got
the beatings on the hand

691
00:45:38,459 --> 00:45:41,361
<i>where his hands are
like permanently broken.</i>

692
00:45:41,394 --> 00:45:43,363
I know he said he
got beatings on the feet.

693
00:45:43,397 --> 00:45:45,300
He has scars
all over his feet.

694
00:45:48,602 --> 00:45:51,872
<i>I would not have lasted.
I know that.</i>

695
00:45:51,906 --> 00:45:54,509
I don't know. I mean
I just remember feeling...

696
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:58,546
Just feeling
really empty, you know

697
00:45:58,578 --> 00:46:04,952
and saying how the hell?
What do you do?

698
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:11,292
I remember thinking
like that can't be possible.

699
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:14,796
Like my understanding of
other countries at that time

700
00:46:14,828 --> 00:46:17,932
it was like textbook
or what you see in the news.

701
00:46:17,964 --> 00:46:20,602
You don't see it happening
to someone that you know.

702
00:46:21,602 --> 00:46:24,872
It's just
unbelievable what goes on.

703
00:46:24,905 --> 00:46:26,673
You don't think
this shit really happens.

704
00:46:26,707 --> 00:46:28,843
You watch a movie....

705
00:46:28,876 --> 00:46:30,011
But this shit
really happens.

706
00:46:30,044 --> 00:46:32,413
And it happened to me.

707
00:46:32,446 --> 00:46:34,949
I was getting tortured.
I got tortured.

708
00:46:34,981 --> 00:46:37,651
And you know it's...

709
00:46:37,685 --> 00:46:41,889
It's painful, but it's
more emotionally painful

710
00:46:41,921 --> 00:46:46,493
than physically. It is. And I
hate thinking about it.

711
00:46:46,526 --> 00:46:48,329
I... I...

712
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,836
When I finally
got brought to...

713
00:46:57,037 --> 00:47:00,407
I got brought back
to the customs lock up

714
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:02,510
and Christy came again.

715
00:47:02,542 --> 00:47:04,444
They let me use
a cell phone to call my mom

716
00:47:04,477 --> 00:47:06,747
to let her know how I was
doing and everything.

717
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:10,018
I didn't tell her anything.
I just said everything was fine.

718
00:47:10,051 --> 00:47:11,819
Everything is fine,
what's going on on your end?

719
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:15,957
She's trying to get lawyers.
She contacted the police

720
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,059
to try to find out where I was.
"We can't find him."

721
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:19,760
That's what's confusing me.

722
00:47:19,794 --> 00:47:21,496
I don't understand
why you can't find Rai.

723
00:47:21,528 --> 00:47:22,929
It should be very easy,
you had cell phones.

724
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:24,598
You shouldn't
be too hard to find.

725
00:47:24,631 --> 00:47:25,899
Everyone knew him.

726
00:47:26,901 --> 00:47:28,669
Rai Ghazarian,
that's all I know.

727
00:47:28,702 --> 00:47:30,771
Rai Ghazarian.

728
00:47:30,805 --> 00:47:32,839
Well one of the reporters
that was there,

729
00:47:32,872 --> 00:47:34,943
I forget which
newspaper he worked for,

730
00:47:35,843 --> 00:47:37,377
but later on that day

731
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,914
somebody from
the office called me

732
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:45,352
and he says: "I think
you've got the wrong person."

733
00:47:45,385 --> 00:47:46,521
I said: "What do you mean?"

734
00:47:46,553 --> 00:47:48,423
'Cause I also gave out

735
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:49,890
the phone numbers that I had.

736
00:47:49,923 --> 00:47:53,327
Well, the cellphone was,
of course you know,

737
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:54,596
dead, no longer good.

738
00:47:55,830 --> 00:47:58,098
and of course, the
office phone was disconnected

739
00:47:58,131 --> 00:48:01,702
but it still can be traced

740
00:48:01,736 --> 00:48:05,073
So they did a reverse
directory on that number.

741
00:48:05,106 --> 00:48:08,575
So I called and I said:
"Can I speak to Rai Ghazarian?"

742
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:13,348
And he said: "Speaking".

743
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:15,750
and I said:
"Are you Rai Ghazarian Jr.

744
00:48:15,783 --> 00:48:19,453
because you're not the Rai
Ghazarian I want to talk to."

745
00:48:19,486 --> 00:48:21,088
And he said:
"What's going on?"

746
00:48:21,122 --> 00:48:23,491
Are you guys trying to
sell me newspapers or what?"

747
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:26,093
And I said: "What do you mean?"

748
00:48:26,127 --> 00:48:28,096
And he said: "The first guy
called asking for me,

749
00:48:28,129 --> 00:48:29,897
doesn't he work
for some newspaper?

750
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,401
Now what, you want me to
buy a subscription or what?"

751
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:34,935
I said: "No sir, I don't.

752
00:48:38,138 --> 00:48:40,040
Let me tell you a story."

753
00:48:41,542 --> 00:48:44,112
And I told him
what he had done to my son.

754
00:48:45,979 --> 00:48:49,416
He says:
"I know who set your son up."

755
00:48:51,952 --> 00:48:53,754
And I said: "Rai Ghazarian."

756
00:48:53,787 --> 00:48:58,457
He said: "No.
His name isn't Rai Ghazarian.

757
00:48:58,459 --> 00:49:00,495
His name is
Razmik Minasian."

758
00:49:03,464 --> 00:49:05,600
M-I-N-A-S-I-A-N.

759
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:07,801
Razmik Minasian.
Let's see what comes up here.

760
00:49:09,202 --> 00:49:11,838
Oh my god.
That's him yeah.

761
00:49:11,872 --> 00:49:13,908
That's him.

762
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:16,144
Now I gotta send him
a message, okay.

763
00:49:17,611 --> 00:49:18,846
Maybe we should go to...

764
00:49:18,879 --> 00:49:21,383
If he has a Linkedin.
Linkedin.

765
00:49:23,117 --> 00:49:27,988
The next day
I'm driven to Rawalpindi.

766
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:34,060
Rawalpindi was home
to the biggest prison

767
00:49:34,093 --> 00:49:35,629
in all of Pakistan.

768
00:49:35,662 --> 00:49:38,800
It was called
Central Jail Adyala.

769
00:49:38,832 --> 00:49:40,734
They have these prisoners
inside the prison

770
00:49:40,767 --> 00:49:44,171
who police the prisoners
they're called <i>numberdards</i>

771
00:49:44,205 --> 00:49:46,540
and they're giving
me a welcoming wagon.

772
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:50,912
Now they're
horse-shoed around the door.

773
00:49:50,944 --> 00:49:53,448
I would say it was
like ten or twelve of them.

774
00:49:53,481 --> 00:49:54,948
But the reason they're
horse-shoed around the door

775
00:49:54,981 --> 00:49:57,984
so they can
corral you and everything.

776
00:49:58,017 --> 00:50:00,821
And the guards think
it's funny. They take bets.

777
00:50:00,854 --> 00:50:03,657
They think it's funny,
who's going to do what to who.

778
00:50:03,691 --> 00:50:05,760
This is just part of
the way it is in Pakistan.

779
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:07,995
So when the guards starts
looking at me like this:

780
00:50:08,028 --> 00:50:10,131
"Hey, get ready.
You're going to fight."

781
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:13,733
And it's like
if you're not...

782
00:50:13,767 --> 00:50:16,971
One of the biggest messages
from any prison movie or show

783
00:50:17,004 --> 00:50:18,739
you ever watch is:
If you go in weak

784
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:20,208
you're going to
be somebody's bitch.

785
00:50:21,542 --> 00:50:22,543
So I got in
that game frame.

786
00:50:22,575 --> 00:50:23,711
This is opening kick-off.

787
00:50:23,743 --> 00:50:25,178
I'm Erik "all day" AudÃ©,

788
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:27,180
the meanest motherfucker
up in this motherfucker.

789
00:50:27,214 --> 00:50:29,083
Let's dance.

790
00:50:29,115 --> 00:50:31,918
I'm dropping them.
I'm bodyslamming these guys.

791
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:35,189
No one at all came close
to fucking me up that day

792
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:36,691
when I first got in there.

793
00:50:38,591 --> 00:50:40,694
This little guy who works...
who's a <i>mishakti</i>.

794
00:50:40,727 --> 00:50:42,662
Mishakti is a prison worker,
not a numberdard,

795
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:44,232
he let's me know
he wants me to follow him

796
00:50:44,265 --> 00:50:46,868
and we go off
into the prison.

797
00:50:46,901 --> 00:50:50,037
I get up to lay down
where a bunch of blankets are.

798
00:50:50,069 --> 00:50:56,577
I just want to sleep but
someone says to me: "American?"

799
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:58,078
I'm like: "Nope.

800
00:50:58,111 --> 00:51:00,682
Pakistan born and raised
right down the road here.

801
00:51:01,582 --> 00:51:02,650
Been here my whole life."

802
00:51:03,816 --> 00:51:05,853
Guy's like, "No.
You're the American."

803
00:51:07,287 --> 00:51:09,723
Shows me the front page
of a newspaper article

804
00:51:09,756 --> 00:51:12,559
and sure enough
there's my dickhead ass.

805
00:51:12,593 --> 00:51:14,861
And I was
smiling for the cameras.

806
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:16,263
So now I'm in another fight

807
00:51:16,296 --> 00:51:18,532
and this time I'm
getting ass handed to me.

808
00:51:18,566 --> 00:51:20,667
I'm losing this fight.
There's just too many.

809
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,603
And this guy was on my back
just scratching me off.

810
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:27,607
I threw him off the balcony
onto a crowd below.

811
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:29,309
I threw him onto a crowd.

812
00:51:29,343 --> 00:51:31,611
And then the guards
ran up to the stairs

813
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:33,113
and started baton charging

814
00:51:33,147 --> 00:51:35,149
and hitting me
with their batons.

815
00:51:37,117 --> 00:51:42,524
I got dragged to a place
in prison called <i>kasoari</i>.

816
00:51:50,664 --> 00:51:52,867
I would spend the first
five days in jail in kasoari.

817
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:56,303
Kasoari is... it's not
a prison sized room,

818
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:57,638
it's like a closet.

819
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:03,944
Once a day everyday

820
00:52:03,977 --> 00:52:05,078
I would have the bottom of my
feet beat.

821
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:09,015
I would spend
a total of 132 days

822
00:52:09,048 --> 00:52:10,951
of the three years that
I would remain in this prison

823
00:52:10,984 --> 00:52:11,986
in that room.

824
00:52:13,153 --> 00:52:17,591
The longest I spend in kasoari
in a row was eight weeks.

825
00:52:19,026 --> 00:52:21,127
The things that you think
about when you're in kasoari

826
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:27,568
are... You start to remember
things you thought you forgot.

827
00:52:28,635 --> 00:52:33,607
How you took shortcuts home from
school when you were a kid...

828
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:38,211
I made up songs...
I relived scenarios of my life.

829
00:52:38,245 --> 00:52:40,013
I watched
movies in my head.

830
00:52:40,046 --> 00:52:44,851
I thought about
the days I would get out

831
00:52:44,885 --> 00:52:48,622
and get my hands
around Rai's neck.

832
00:52:48,656 --> 00:52:50,325
I thought
about Missy a lot.

833
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:53,660
You know you just...

834
00:52:56,729 --> 00:52:58,832
You just think.
That's all you can do.

835
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:04,338
<i>In the beginning there
was a lot of high hopes for</i>

836
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,040
<i>him coming home</i>

837
00:53:07,073 --> 00:53:10,711
<i>and us being able to
have a relationship</i>

838
00:53:10,743 --> 00:53:12,912
<i>and a lot of
different things happening.</i>

839
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:17,652
<i>and you just... We could not have
anticipated things happening</i>

840
00:53:17,685 --> 00:53:21,889
<i>the way that they did.
I don't think anyone can.</i>

841
00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:26,793
And were you aware of
what was happening to him

842
00:53:26,827 --> 00:53:29,095
while he was in the
prison and the torture and...

843
00:53:29,129 --> 00:53:31,031
<i>Erik
didn't tell me a lot.</i>

844
00:53:31,064 --> 00:53:32,899
<i>I think he just
didn't want to worry me.</i>

845
00:53:32,932 --> 00:53:35,802
<i>and he'd tell his mom
not to tell me things,</i>

846
00:53:35,836 --> 00:53:37,872
<i>but Sherry would
tell me some stuff anyways.</i>

847
00:53:37,905 --> 00:53:40,008
<i>So I was aware to a point.</i>

848
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:43,810
<i>I don't think I ever
had the full picture of it</i>

849
00:53:43,843 --> 00:53:46,914
<i>at that time,</i>

850
00:53:46,946 --> 00:53:50,952
<i>but Erik always tried to
paint a happier picture for me.</i>

851
00:53:51,885 --> 00:53:55,156
I did not know the extent
of what he was experiencing

852
00:53:55,189 --> 00:53:56,924
when he first got there

853
00:53:56,957 --> 00:53:58,725
and I think that was
a conscious choice for him

854
00:53:58,758 --> 00:54:00,894
not to share it with me

855
00:54:00,928 --> 00:54:04,265
because me being
upset or crying on the phone

856
00:54:04,298 --> 00:54:05,899
was not going to help him

857
00:54:05,932 --> 00:54:08,702
needing to hear
positivity and hope

858
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:10,471
and someone to
have a positive outlook

859
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:12,239
and tell him like:
"Dude, you're coming back.

860
00:54:12,272 --> 00:54:14,308
We all know it. we're all
believing it.

861
00:54:14,341 --> 00:54:15,243
I'll see you soon."

862
00:54:18,845 --> 00:54:21,014
I couldn't
be in general population

863
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:26,319
because some asshole put a
5,000 rupee bounty on my head.

864
00:54:26,352 --> 00:54:28,955
And whenever someone asks me,
"Hey what's your life worth?"

865
00:54:28,988 --> 00:54:30,857
I know exactly
what my life is worth:

866
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,126
My life is worth 87 dollars.

867
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:40,201
So my job was
to keep his spirits up,

868
00:54:40,234 --> 00:54:42,136
keep him fed,
keep him alive,

869
00:54:43,803 --> 00:54:47,742
keep the news media on him.

870
00:54:47,774 --> 00:54:50,110
Because as long as I
could keep his name out there,

871
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,480
Pakistan was not about
to do anything to him

872
00:54:53,513 --> 00:54:55,415
because the world
was watching.

873
00:54:55,448 --> 00:54:56,717
She was a wreck.

874
00:54:57,852 --> 00:55:00,287
She was, she wanted to
go over there and get him out

875
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,323
but of course she can't.

876
00:55:02,356 --> 00:55:05,126
but she would
just call the senator

877
00:55:05,158 --> 00:55:07,193
and people who she
thought could help him get out.

878
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:10,297
We would do walks
to try to get him out.

879
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:13,400
She had yard sales to
collect money to send him money

880
00:55:13,432 --> 00:55:16,002
because he needed money
and food you know, to buy.

881
00:55:17,571 --> 00:55:19,507
And I know that she
would just do anything

882
00:55:19,539 --> 00:55:21,341
to get her son
out of that prison.

883
00:55:25,312 --> 00:55:27,848
A superintendent
came to the prison and said:

884
00:55:27,881 --> 00:55:33,487
"Hey, the safest place for us to
put this guy is on death row."

885
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,757
I got put in my
own cell on death row

886
00:55:37,457 --> 00:55:39,993
which is a luxury, having
your own cell is a luxury,

887
00:55:40,026 --> 00:55:42,328
and there's are no beds,
you sleep on the floor.

888
00:55:42,361 --> 00:55:43,964
You have one squat toilet.

889
00:55:45,499 --> 00:55:47,868
You wipe your ass with your hand
and then wash your hand off.

890
00:55:47,901 --> 00:55:50,303
There's no toilet paper.
That's just how it is.

891
00:55:51,939 --> 00:55:53,808
And these rooms
are covered cockroaches,

892
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:56,444
covered with mosquitos,
with spiders.

893
00:55:57,877 --> 00:56:01,115
The elements are there
for the wind to come in sideways

894
00:56:01,147 --> 00:56:03,050
and dust going in.

895
00:56:03,082 --> 00:56:04,918
When it rains
the cells fill up

896
00:56:04,952 --> 00:56:07,955
and the rats will
start to swim around.

897
00:56:09,455 --> 00:56:11,191
The first few months
were really terrible

898
00:56:11,225 --> 00:56:13,828
because I was hungry.
I was starving.

899
00:56:13,861 --> 00:56:16,397
I'm literally twice the size
of everyone around me

900
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,366
and I was getting the same
amount of food as all of them.

901
00:56:19,399 --> 00:56:21,101
So I was always hungry.

902
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:22,902
If you want to eat more,
you have to have money

903
00:56:22,935 --> 00:56:24,838
and buy from one
of the outside cantinas

904
00:56:24,872 --> 00:56:27,473
or bribe the guards to
go out and get it for you.

905
00:56:27,506 --> 00:56:31,412
But I have no way to
communicate other than...

906
00:56:31,444 --> 00:56:34,582
Literally the first
few weeks I started realizing

907
00:56:34,615 --> 00:56:36,283
I need to
understand these people

908
00:56:36,316 --> 00:56:38,352
because no one is
able to understand me.

909
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:43,423
What I would do is I would tear
pieces of paper into sections,

910
00:56:43,457 --> 00:56:49,263
fold em up and I would
start writing the words in Urdu,

911
00:56:49,296 --> 00:56:51,298
and the way they're written,
the way it sound,

912
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:54,035
and I was learning
20 to 40 words a day.

913
00:56:55,202 --> 00:56:58,606
Because he was somebody
that could just pick up book

914
00:56:58,638 --> 00:57:01,474
and teach himself,
I think that helped him too.

915
00:57:01,508 --> 00:57:03,377
Other people
started to respect him more

916
00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:04,879
when he
learned their language.

917
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:15,488
In the room just next
to me was a man named Mourad.

918
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:19,126
Mourad could speak
a little bit of English.

919
00:57:19,158 --> 00:57:22,296
He was very friendly to me,
offered me lunch, breakfast.

920
00:57:24,330 --> 00:57:26,165
He was the only one
that spoke any English,

921
00:57:26,198 --> 00:57:30,003
so him and I would
become very good friends.

922
00:57:30,037 --> 00:57:31,606
We would become
best friends in prison.

923
00:57:33,673 --> 00:57:37,977
He was on death row for killing
11 of his wife's family members.

924
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,179
And it sounds awful
and it is.

925
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:44,218
In Pakistan you're told
who you're going to marry.

926
00:57:45,318 --> 00:57:49,355
And Mourad and his
wife fell in love on their own

927
00:57:49,388 --> 00:57:53,126
and they had to
run away to be together.

928
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,129
And they ran
away and got married.

929
00:57:55,162 --> 00:57:57,164
Well, while they ran away
both their families were

930
00:57:57,196 --> 00:58:01,068
feuding and fighting. They were
killing each other.

931
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:04,405
They were accusing one
another of hiding the couple.

932
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:06,039
Well what brought
him out of hiding was

933
00:58:06,073 --> 00:58:09,276
his wife's
family members kidnapped

934
00:58:09,309 --> 00:58:11,211
his mother and his sister

935
00:58:11,243 --> 00:58:13,414
and they
gang raped them and

936
00:58:13,446 --> 00:58:16,450
murdered them
by having their

937
00:58:16,482 --> 00:58:18,586
breasts cut off and
letting them bleed to death.

938
00:58:25,624 --> 00:58:28,261
So Mourad ambushed
his wife's family members

939
00:58:28,294 --> 00:58:29,530
killing 11 of them.

940
00:58:33,165 --> 00:58:36,569
But in jail he wasn't...
You know

941
00:58:36,602 --> 00:58:40,073
he was very kind to me. And
he introduced me to the game of

942
00:58:40,106 --> 00:58:41,742
Texas Hold 'em poker.

943
00:58:41,774 --> 00:58:44,677
The first time I ever
picked up a hand at poker

944
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:46,280
was on death row in Pakistan.

945
00:58:58,158 --> 00:58:59,493
when you play
all the time

946
00:58:59,526 --> 00:59:01,060
you start to
learn how to read people.

947
00:59:01,093 --> 00:59:03,162
It doesn't
matter what language

948
00:59:03,196 --> 00:59:06,433
they speak or anything,
but when people are scared

949
00:59:06,466 --> 00:59:10,972
it shows the same regardless
of what nationality they are.

950
00:59:20,647 --> 00:59:22,216
Hardly any
of the politicians

951
00:59:22,249 --> 00:59:24,051
wanted to get involved.

952
00:59:24,084 --> 00:59:25,152
I was pretty much on my own.

953
00:59:26,285 --> 00:59:27,553
I was spending like I said,

954
00:59:27,586 --> 00:59:29,622
I slept maybe an hour a day.

955
00:59:29,656 --> 00:59:33,127
because I felt like
I was in a maze, you know,

956
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,162
because so many doors
were being closed,

957
00:59:35,194 --> 00:59:36,664
but I had to keep going.

958
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:44,104
You know when you have this
deep... like deep inside you:

959
00:59:44,136 --> 00:59:45,472
"He's coming back."

960
00:59:45,504 --> 00:59:47,540
And sometimes
the other mind told you,

961
00:59:47,573 --> 00:59:52,378
"Wake up, this is
a cold case in Pakistan,

962
00:59:52,412 --> 00:59:53,781
it's not going to happen."

963
00:59:53,814 --> 00:59:55,415
and you're like
going back and forth

964
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:57,251
with your head
like a crazy man,

965
00:59:57,283 --> 01:00:00,319
it's the same thing. And
on the other side you're like,

966
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:02,488
all these
people sending letters,

967
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:05,826
people calling, there
is a hope that somebody will

968
01:00:05,859 --> 01:00:08,662
do something so that's
the only thing that's making me

969
01:00:08,694 --> 01:00:11,664
have a huge
hope he's coming back.

970
01:00:11,698 --> 01:00:14,368
On the other hand
I look at the case...

971
01:00:14,401 --> 01:00:16,504
Until the guy
got arrested.

972
01:00:20,539 --> 01:00:22,842
<i>Roughly six months
after I was in jail</i>

973
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:26,814
<i>a DEA agent comes
and he shows me two photos</i>

974
01:00:26,847 --> 01:00:29,450
<i>and asked me do I recognize
anyone in these photos.</i>

975
01:00:29,482 --> 01:00:31,350
<i>I immediately picked out Rai.
I was like: "That's Rai."</i>

976
01:00:31,383 --> 01:00:33,453
And he goes, "Well his
name is Razmik Minasian."

977
01:00:33,486 --> 01:00:34,854
And this is where I would
find out that he

978
01:00:34,888 --> 01:00:37,758
had been using
an alias the whole time.

979
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:39,660
And I'm like: "Cool,
well how did you guys get him?"

980
01:00:39,693 --> 01:00:42,863
What had happened was a Swedish
woman was traveling in

981
01:00:42,896 --> 01:00:45,365
<i>from JFK airport, doing
the same thing I was doing,</i>

982
01:00:45,397 --> 01:00:47,501
<i>but she lost
her luggage at JFK.</i>

983
01:00:47,533 --> 01:00:49,769
So she continued on
her itinerary to LAX.

984
01:00:49,803 --> 01:00:51,839
<i>They found the drugs
in the wall of her suitcase,</i>

985
01:00:51,872 --> 01:00:53,740
<i>built professionally
into the suitcase,</i>

986
01:00:53,772 --> 01:00:55,508
<i>and they arrested both her</i>

987
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:57,411
and the man that I
had known as Rai Ghazarian.

988
01:00:57,443 --> 01:01:00,080
Except he posted bail
under the name Razmik Minasian.

989
01:01:01,414 --> 01:01:03,249
<i>My mom's private investigator
hears about this,</i>

990
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:05,252
<i>brings it to the
attention of the DEA</i>

991
01:01:05,285 --> 01:01:08,455
<i>and hey this sounds a lot
like that guy who set up Erik.</i>

992
01:01:08,488 --> 01:01:10,857
<i>So they rearrest him,
deny him bail...</i>

993
01:01:10,890 --> 01:01:13,193
<i>They let the Swedish girl
go back to her country</i>

994
01:01:13,225 --> 01:01:15,194
without being charged
in less than two weeks

995
01:01:15,227 --> 01:01:18,564
simply because her story
matched mine and several others.

996
01:01:18,597 --> 01:01:20,500
So when I heard about this
I felt great.

997
01:01:20,533 --> 01:01:22,468
I'm like: "Great, someone's
not in jail because of me."

998
01:01:22,502 --> 01:01:24,538
That's awesome.
I felt good about that.

999
01:01:24,571 --> 01:01:27,708
So now here I got the
DEA guy telling me this story

1000
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,809
and I'm asking
what happens now?

1001
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:31,678
"What are you guys doing
to get me out of here?"

1002
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:36,383
And I could tell by his
expression that he felt bad.

1003
01:01:37,651 --> 01:01:39,853
And I'm like:
"What's going on?"

1004
01:01:39,885 --> 01:01:41,420
He goes: "I've never
seen this before."

1005
01:01:41,453 --> 01:01:43,390
I go: "What do you mean?"

1006
01:01:43,423 --> 01:01:45,158
He said: "I've never actually
met someone who's innocent."

1007
01:01:45,892 --> 01:01:49,230
They let her go home
and arrested him.

1008
01:01:51,932 --> 01:01:56,303
But nobody would do anything
to help me get Erik home.

1009
01:01:59,673 --> 01:02:01,808
He goes: "If this
had been done in America

1010
01:02:01,841 --> 01:02:03,544
you'd be
going home tonight.

1011
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:05,379
Because since it's
done here in Pakistan,

1012
01:02:05,412 --> 01:02:07,747
you still have to go through
the legal system here.

1013
01:02:07,781 --> 01:02:10,350
It sucked being in jail
for something I didn't do

1014
01:02:10,383 --> 01:02:12,785
and no one believing me,
but believe it or not

1015
01:02:12,818 --> 01:02:15,555
it sucks a lot worse when
people actually believe you,

1016
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:17,691
and the people
you assumed could...

1017
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:19,626
And the people that you know
that could do something

1018
01:02:19,658 --> 01:02:22,396
about it believe you, but choose
not to do anything about it.

1019
01:02:24,531 --> 01:02:26,266
Yeah, no that's great.

1020
01:02:26,298 --> 01:02:27,867
OK, so I need to
ask you, so what was the

1021
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:29,403
involvement
with your friend

1022
01:02:29,435 --> 01:02:31,704
that was the PI?
Can we call him and see?

1023
01:02:31,738 --> 01:02:33,807
Yeah, let's just see.

1024
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:35,608
so and
then my question is...

1025
01:02:35,642 --> 01:02:37,743
So I really
want to interview Rai

1026
01:02:37,776 --> 01:02:40,313
but I'm having a really
hard time tracking him down.

1027
01:02:40,347 --> 01:02:42,682
I have a phone number
that's disconnected.

1028
01:02:42,716 --> 01:02:46,520
I found an address on the
Internet that could be his...

1029
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:50,257
I found a bunch of
businesses that he used to have

1030
01:02:50,289 --> 01:02:51,958
that seemed
to all dissolve

1031
01:02:51,992 --> 01:02:53,859
and all those numbers
are disconnected.

1032
01:02:53,892 --> 01:02:56,262
I sent him a message,
I found him on Facebook

1033
01:02:56,296 --> 01:02:57,631
but we're not connected

1034
01:02:57,664 --> 01:02:59,332
so he hasn't
seen the message yet.

1035
01:02:59,365 --> 01:03:01,267
But we're
kind of at the end

1036
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:03,403
and I really didn't find...

1037
01:03:03,435 --> 01:03:06,439
How I could go about
finding an address,

1038
01:03:06,472 --> 01:03:07,941
an email, a phone number.

1039
01:03:08,841 --> 01:03:12,678
<i>If you
have either his full name</i>

1040
01:03:12,711 --> 01:03:18,551
<i>and middle initial or
his social security number</i>

1041
01:03:18,584 --> 01:03:22,455
<i>or a former address</i>

1042
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:26,457
<i>I can find out
where he is now.</i>

1043
01:03:26,459 --> 01:03:27,560
- Okay.
- A former address?

1044
01:03:27,593 --> 01:03:29,296
A former address?

1045
01:03:29,328 --> 01:03:32,466
what if it was an old...
an old business address

1046
01:03:32,499 --> 01:03:34,434
or one that he used
for a business?

1047
01:03:34,466 --> 01:03:35,801
Would that work?

1048
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:37,603
<i>Yeah,
that would work.</i>

1049
01:03:37,636 --> 01:03:40,274
<i>And it probably would
take about an hour</i>

1050
01:03:40,307 --> 01:03:43,910
<i>to get the
complete background on him.</i>

1051
01:03:44,877 --> 01:03:45,812
Some of
the superintendents

1052
01:03:45,845 --> 01:03:46,747
started liking me,

1053
01:03:46,780 --> 01:03:48,015
one in particular

1054
01:03:48,048 --> 01:03:49,582
was a man named Hijuub.

1055
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:50,850
He's the one who would
introduce me

1056
01:03:50,883 --> 01:03:52,852
to the
Palestinian hijackers.

1057
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:55,921
<i>The hijacking
of Pan Am flight 73 is over</i>

1058
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:57,991
<i>but the cost
has been very high.</i>

1059
01:03:58,024 --> 01:04:00,794
<i>Many passengers who
were on board are in shock.</i>

1060
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:03,629
<i>many have been wounded
in the final orgy of violence,</i>

1061
01:04:03,662 --> 01:04:06,800
<i>and some passengers
plus two of the hijackers</i>

1062
01:04:06,832 --> 01:04:08,434
<i>have been killed.</i>

1063
01:04:09,669 --> 01:04:11,972
these guys were happy
that their plan had failed

1064
01:04:12,004 --> 01:04:13,839
because their
mission was to kill themselves

1065
01:04:13,872 --> 01:04:15,541
and kill everyone
on board that plane.

1066
01:04:15,575 --> 01:04:18,011
what did happen, was
their actions led to

1067
01:04:18,044 --> 01:04:19,647
23 people being killed.

1068
01:04:20,613 --> 01:04:22,381
The first person
I meet was Fahaad.

1069
01:04:22,414 --> 01:04:23,050
Fahaad was the youngest
and by this time he's

1070
01:04:23,082 --> 01:04:24,885
in his thirties.

1071
01:04:24,917 --> 01:04:27,787
He's a big man and
he's wearing a big muumuu.

1072
01:04:29,089 --> 01:04:30,624
The hijackers are
celebrities in here.

1073
01:04:30,656 --> 01:04:31,691
I'm a celebrity in here.

1074
01:04:32,892 --> 01:04:35,828
The future prime minister
of Pakistan is up in "A class".

1075
01:04:35,861 --> 01:04:38,798
His name is Yousaf Gilani
he's a celebrity in there.

1076
01:04:38,832 --> 01:04:40,400
And then you've got
political officials

1077
01:04:40,432 --> 01:04:42,001
but there's
really only a few of us

1078
01:04:42,035 --> 01:04:43,370
who everyone knows of.

1079
01:04:44,571 --> 01:04:47,641
So I somehow become
friends with these guys.

1080
01:04:47,673 --> 01:04:49,942
They order...
They make food for us,

1081
01:04:49,975 --> 01:04:52,878
we sit around, we drink Pepsi

1082
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:54,881
and some sweet dish
they just happen to have,

1083
01:04:54,914 --> 01:04:56,649
and their rooms
are really nice actually

1084
01:04:56,682 --> 01:04:58,484
there's
a carpet on the floor.

1085
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:00,553
They prayed, they ate food,

1086
01:05:00,586 --> 01:05:03,456
and tried to get through
each day as easily as possible.

1087
01:05:04,758 --> 01:05:06,626
When I got moved nine
and a half months later

1088
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:08,427
from death row to two cell

1089
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:10,597
I was able to
socialize with these guys more.

1090
01:05:10,629 --> 01:05:12,131
Go have breakfast
and lunch with them

1091
01:05:12,164 --> 01:05:14,800
and swap
books over the wall.

1092
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:18,071
But one thing that the hijackers
had, which was a big deal,

1093
01:05:18,104 --> 01:05:19,906
was they had
connections with the guard.

1094
01:05:19,939 --> 01:05:21,975
The guards
wouldn't search the room.

1095
01:05:22,008 --> 01:05:24,044
The hijackers were left alone
and they had a lot of clout.

1096
01:05:24,077 --> 01:05:25,713
They had something
that I definitely needed.

1097
01:05:32,685 --> 01:05:38,058
How did you get
a camera inside prison?

1098
01:05:38,091 --> 01:05:40,794
I got a camera into the prison
because of one of the hijackers,

1099
01:05:40,827 --> 01:05:43,562
Fahaad got it in for me.

1100
01:05:43,595 --> 01:05:47,400
I wanted to take some photos
and he got it in.

1101
01:05:47,434 --> 01:05:49,136
Like what
would happen if they found...

1102
01:05:49,169 --> 01:05:51,538
Like people don't have
cameras in prison, do they?

1103
01:05:51,571 --> 01:05:54,473
People aren't supposed to have
a lot of things in prison,

1104
01:05:54,506 --> 01:05:56,075
but we have them.
if you get caught with them

1105
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:58,812
you get in trouble. Simple.

1106
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:00,647
Getting in trouble is
getting beat, punished,

1107
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:01,749
thrown into kasoari.

1108
01:06:02,881 --> 01:06:04,684
Privileges taken away.

1109
01:06:04,716 --> 01:06:06,153
But
how do you get them?

1110
01:06:06,185 --> 01:06:07,988
You actually just
pay people on the outside?

1111
01:06:08,021 --> 01:06:11,124
Yeah! People...
Guards smuggle things in,

1112
01:06:11,156 --> 01:06:13,526
religious teachers
smuggle things in,

1113
01:06:13,560 --> 01:06:15,095
prisoners smuggle things in,

1114
01:06:15,127 --> 01:06:17,696
the canteen smuggles things in.

1115
01:06:17,729 --> 01:06:19,198
Guys throw things
over the wall.

1116
01:06:19,231 --> 01:06:21,434
Hell fuck, if we had
drones back in the day

1117
01:06:21,468 --> 01:06:23,636
you'd see drones dropping things
left and right.

1118
01:06:25,738 --> 01:06:26,839
Wow, that's amazing.

1119
01:06:26,872 --> 01:06:28,675
I'm glad I got some photos.

1120
01:06:28,707 --> 01:06:32,546
I had the camera for I think
two, maybe three days.

1121
01:06:32,578 --> 01:06:33,780
And that's what
I was able to get

1122
01:06:33,812 --> 01:06:35,749
in those two
or three days.

1123
01:06:35,781 --> 01:06:38,117
It started with food. Well
then it got to things bigger.

1124
01:06:38,151 --> 01:06:40,720
"Hey, I'll give you
1,000 rupees for a cell phone."

1125
01:06:40,752 --> 01:06:42,689
Guy brings me
a cell phone.

1126
01:06:42,722 --> 01:06:45,959
I'm able to find a signal
in a corner of my room

1127
01:06:45,992 --> 01:06:47,493
and at night I'm able
to communicate

1128
01:06:47,526 --> 01:06:49,463
with my family
and my friends.

1129
01:06:49,495 --> 01:06:51,497
The first time
I go to talk to Erik...

1130
01:06:51,531 --> 01:06:52,966
First of all I was blown
'cause I was like:

1131
01:06:52,999 --> 01:06:55,234
"How the hell did you
get a cell phone?"

1132
01:06:55,267 --> 01:06:57,102
And then at the same token
I was like: "Of course,

1133
01:06:57,135 --> 01:07:00,172
it's you, it's Erik."
You know. And we talked about

1134
01:07:00,205 --> 01:07:03,609
how he had made friends
with some people in there.

1135
01:07:03,642 --> 01:07:08,048
We talked about how initially
it was super, super, super hard

1136
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,982
kinda being the
American so to speak.

1137
01:07:11,017 --> 01:07:13,153
We talked about how he
learned different languages.

1138
01:07:13,185 --> 01:07:14,988
How he
cultivated relationships.

1139
01:07:15,021 --> 01:07:16,756
How he was able to
get some DVD's and movies

1140
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:19,526
that I had done
that he had watched.

1141
01:07:21,127 --> 01:07:23,129
And it just
was good, you know,

1142
01:07:23,162 --> 01:07:27,600
And we still just
believed that eventually

1143
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:28,901
he would come home.

1144
01:07:37,609 --> 01:07:39,546
During this whole time
I'm still learning the language.

1145
01:07:39,578 --> 01:07:40,981
I'm still learning Urdu.

1146
01:07:41,914 --> 01:07:43,249
And I'm also
trying to work on my case.

1147
01:07:43,283 --> 01:07:45,018
I'd finally
gotten a lawyer

1148
01:07:45,051 --> 01:07:47,087
who was just a piece
of shit lawyer to agree to

1149
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:49,055
take my case
for 2,000 dollars

1150
01:07:49,088 --> 01:07:51,825
which is still five times more
than anyone else would have paid

1151
01:07:51,857 --> 01:07:55,095
but it's a lot less than a lot
of lawyers are asking me for.

1152
01:07:55,127 --> 01:07:58,899
and I would go back and
forth to court so many times

1153
01:07:58,932 --> 01:08:01,134
and nothing would happen. either
the judge wouldn't show up,

1154
01:08:01,167 --> 01:08:02,602
the prosecutor
wouldn't show up,

1155
01:08:02,635 --> 01:08:04,236
my own lawyer
wouldn't show up.

1156
01:08:04,269 --> 01:08:09,175
What we needed for the
courts, was Razmik Menasian

1157
01:08:10,176 --> 01:08:12,913
to sign a statement
stating that

1158
01:08:12,946 --> 01:08:15,281
he'd never told Erik
about the drugs

1159
01:08:15,314 --> 01:08:19,552
and that might,
might you know, do some good.

1160
01:08:21,988 --> 01:08:24,057
I had found out
where he lived

1161
01:08:24,958 --> 01:08:27,727
and I found out
he had two kids

1162
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:29,829
and I'm not
a vindictive woman,

1163
01:08:29,861 --> 01:08:33,632
but I was
fighting for my son.

1164
01:08:33,665 --> 01:08:35,101
I wrote him a letter

1165
01:08:36,168 --> 01:08:39,705
and I told him
how Erik couldn't believe

1166
01:08:39,739 --> 01:08:42,943
that his friend Rai
would do this to him.

1167
01:08:42,976 --> 01:08:46,313
I mean Rai was his friend,
he was just in shock.

1168
01:08:46,346 --> 01:08:48,815
And I wrote in there
how Erik was being starved,

1169
01:08:48,847 --> 01:08:50,883
and tortured, and beaten.

1170
01:08:50,917 --> 01:08:53,019
You know I said
he can't believe

1171
01:08:53,052 --> 01:08:54,922
you would do this to him.

1172
01:08:56,055 --> 01:09:00,894
And then I went on and I said:
"How maybe if he would confess

1173
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:04,830
that maybe the courts would look
at that

1174
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:07,801
and grant Erik clemency."

1175
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,272
And then I went
one step further,

1176
01:09:12,305 --> 01:09:15,107
and I'm ashamed of it
but I had to do it.

1177
01:09:18,744 --> 01:09:23,082
I said: "I know you're
surprised that we found you,

1178
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:26,686
because we know
you as Rai Ghazarian.

1179
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:30,823
But now that I know
you're Razmik Minasian,

1180
01:09:32,091 --> 01:09:34,127
what would you do

1181
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:37,997
if someone was going to
hurt your son or daughter?

1182
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:39,332
Think about it."

1183
01:09:48,007 --> 01:09:50,110
He signed
an affidavit stating

1184
01:09:50,142 --> 01:09:52,244
that I was
absolutely unknowing.

1185
01:09:53,178 --> 01:09:56,382
So I go to court January third
and the lady says to me:

1186
01:09:56,415 --> 01:09:58,351
"Erik, this is
what's going to happen:

1187
01:09:58,383 --> 01:10:00,753
The judge is going to give you
a two year prison sentence,

1188
01:10:00,787 --> 01:10:03,423
we're going to pay him 1,000
dollars through your account,

1189
01:10:03,455 --> 01:10:06,359
it's already in your account,
and with good behavior

1190
01:10:06,391 --> 01:10:08,961
you'll probably be going home
in a couple months."

1191
01:10:08,994 --> 01:10:10,763
I said: "This is great,
this is great news,

1192
01:10:10,797 --> 01:10:13,299
that's awesome."
They go: "Okay.

1193
01:10:13,332 --> 01:10:18,405
All you have to do though
is plead guilty."

1194
01:10:18,437 --> 01:10:20,740
At that moment
I didn't know...

1195
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,108
I didn't know
what I was going to do.

1196
01:10:23,141 --> 01:10:25,444
What solidified my choice was
what Absaal

1197
01:10:25,477 --> 01:10:26,980
the interpreter
from the embassy said.

1198
01:10:27,012 --> 01:10:28,781
He stands next to me
and he goes:

1199
01:10:28,815 --> 01:10:30,850
"Erik, what is
worth more to you,

1200
01:10:30,882 --> 01:10:32,718
your pride
or your freedom?"

1201
01:10:34,787 --> 01:10:36,222
And I remember
looking at him and I was like:

1202
01:10:36,254 --> 01:10:38,025
"You little bastard."

1203
01:10:41,828 --> 01:10:44,064
Because that made me
ask myself that question:

1204
01:10:44,096 --> 01:10:46,065
What is worth more to me?

1205
01:10:46,098 --> 01:10:52,838
My pride or my freedom?
And there was no hesitation.

1206
01:10:52,872 --> 01:10:55,341
My pride is worth
a hell of a lot more

1207
01:10:55,373 --> 01:10:57,109
to me than my freedom.

1208
01:10:58,477 --> 01:11:01,780
At the end of the day I have
to look at myself in the mirror

1209
01:11:01,814 --> 01:11:03,816
and if I get out of prison

1210
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:06,086
I'm going to end up
killing myself 100 percent

1211
01:11:06,119 --> 01:11:09,055
from just shame of
going around pleading guilty

1212
01:11:09,087 --> 01:11:11,323
for some shit
I didn't fucking do.

1213
01:11:11,356 --> 01:11:13,493
Yeah, it's Pakistan,

1214
01:11:13,525 --> 01:11:16,962
but yes my pride is worth
a hell of a lot more to me

1215
01:11:16,995 --> 01:11:18,131
than my freedom.

1216
01:11:19,966 --> 01:11:22,202
When I got presented
back in that room that day

1217
01:11:22,235 --> 01:11:26,005
the judge asked me if
I wished to change my plea

1218
01:11:26,038 --> 01:11:29,276
and I told him
"No, not guilty."

1219
01:11:40,953 --> 01:11:42,922
I went into Erik's room

1220
01:11:42,954 --> 01:11:44,323
and I opened his closet

1221
01:11:50,562 --> 01:11:54,066
and I wanted
to smell my son.

1222
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:58,171
And I held all his clothes
and there wasn't any smell.

1223
01:11:58,204 --> 01:12:00,941
And I didn't know I
had collapsed to the floor.

1224
01:12:02,074 --> 01:12:04,978
And I heard
this animal howling

1225
01:12:05,912 --> 01:12:09,915
and you could tell
the animal was in pain

1226
01:12:09,949 --> 01:12:13,120
I mean absolute pain...

1227
01:12:15,320 --> 01:12:17,356
And I realized it was me.

1228
01:12:27,132 --> 01:12:28,400
<i>Hello?</i>

1229
01:12:28,434 --> 01:12:30,236
Hi, can I please
speak with Razmik?

1230
01:12:32,038 --> 01:12:34,040
<i>He's not here,
may I ask who's calling?</i>

1231
01:12:35,141 --> 01:12:37,544
My name is
Jamielyn Lippman

1232
01:12:37,577 --> 01:12:41,079
and I'm a documentary filmmaker
and I wanted to talk to him

1233
01:12:41,113 --> 01:12:43,816
about being part of
a project that I'm making.

1234
01:12:46,218 --> 01:12:48,120
<i>Ok, he's not here.</i>

1235
01:12:48,154 --> 01:12:51,391
Can I... Is there a better
time that I could call back

1236
01:12:51,423 --> 01:12:53,359
to reach him or does
he have a cell phone number?

1237
01:12:53,391 --> 01:12:55,427
<i>Maybe
around six o'clock?</i>

1238
01:12:56,628 --> 01:12:58,330
Call him
about six o'clock?

1239
01:12:58,364 --> 01:12:59,499
Okay. Should I leave
my information with you

1240
01:12:59,531 --> 01:13:00,801
or should I try him back?

1241
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:04,436
<i>I can take
your phone number, sure.</i>

1242
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:06,138
Yeah, that would
be great, thank you.

1243
01:13:06,172 --> 01:13:07,440
<i>Hold on one moment.</i>

1244
01:13:15,314 --> 01:13:17,316
The very next morning
I went and called my mom

1245
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:19,185
and I said: "Mom look,

1246
01:13:19,217 --> 01:13:21,354
I already know what I'm
going to do for the high court."

1247
01:13:21,387 --> 01:13:23,156
And I tried to tell her
my plan for the high court

1248
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:24,891
and she had
already cut me off.

1249
01:13:24,923 --> 01:13:26,391
She said that she
already had a lawyer lined up

1250
01:13:26,425 --> 01:13:28,160
for me, that this guy
was one of the best

1251
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:31,598
that he came
highly recommended.

1252
01:13:31,631 --> 01:13:33,466
She was so confident
over the phone I said...

1253
01:13:33,498 --> 01:13:35,301
I gave her my blessing.
go ahead, go with this guy.

1254
01:13:36,968 --> 01:13:39,939
Originally my mother told me
that he took the case pro bono.

1255
01:13:39,971 --> 01:13:44,543
a couple months go by
and I finally ask my mom,

1256
01:13:44,577 --> 01:13:46,445
I go: "Mom what's
going on with my case?"

1257
01:14:04,931 --> 01:14:06,432
The hijackers say:

1258
01:14:06,464 --> 01:14:08,668
"We have a lawyer that we'd like
to recommend.

1259
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,370
The same lawyer that represented
us for our case."

1260
01:14:11,404 --> 01:14:13,039
Seven months
after I'd been sentenced

1261
01:14:13,071 --> 01:14:14,440
we threw ourselves
at the mercy of the court

1262
01:14:14,472 --> 01:14:18,211
to hopefully show leniency.
They did.

1263
01:14:18,244 --> 01:14:20,380
They gave me a second chance
at the high court.

1264
01:14:20,413 --> 01:14:22,515
But what should have been
done seven months previous

1265
01:14:22,547 --> 01:14:24,283
was being done
seven months later.

1266
01:14:26,718 --> 01:14:28,954
Well because of
the amount of cases

1267
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:30,522
that were going to
be shown at high court

1268
01:14:30,556 --> 01:14:34,093
it wouldn't be for
another year and four months

1269
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:36,562
before my case
would finally get heard.

1270
01:14:36,595 --> 01:14:38,932
Before that
would happen, though

1271
01:14:38,964 --> 01:14:40,232
I would take one
of the worst beatings

1272
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:43,469
I've ever taken in my life.

1273
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:48,607
We had a guard he was...
He was nicknamed Goldleaf,

1274
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:52,545
and Goldleaf is the name of
a cigarette brand in Pakistan.

1275
01:14:55,114 --> 01:14:57,450
<i>It was rumored that
he was responsible for</i>

1276
01:14:57,482 --> 01:14:59,052
<i>the death of
hundreds of prisoners</i>

1277
01:14:59,084 --> 01:15:01,253
<i>since that prison
had opened up in 1986</i>

1278
01:15:01,287 --> 01:15:03,722
<i>who either couldn't afford
to buy him Goldleaf cigarettes</i>

1279
01:15:03,756 --> 01:15:05,392
<i>or just flat out
refused to.</i>

1280
01:15:06,324 --> 01:15:09,461
I had been dealing
with these severe ear aches

1281
01:15:09,494 --> 01:15:13,098
ever since monsoon season had
happened my first year there.

1282
01:15:13,132 --> 01:15:15,668
<i>The cockroaches would
come out of their hiding places</i>

1283
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,502
<i>in masses
and crawl all over you.</i>

1284
01:15:17,535 --> 01:15:22,175
<i>You'd get mosquitos biting
every open inch of you.</i>

1285
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:25,244
<i>And you would
sleep in the water.</i>

1286
01:15:25,276 --> 01:15:29,082
I would literally
think suicide all the time

1287
01:15:29,114 --> 01:15:30,749
because of my ears.
Not because of

1288
01:15:30,783 --> 01:15:35,221
being in this situation
or being alone or being sad

1289
01:15:35,253 --> 01:15:37,222
or feeling sorry for myself,
but because

1290
01:15:37,256 --> 01:15:39,124
I was in
so much pain that I thought:

1291
01:15:39,158 --> 01:15:41,227
"Hey, if I kill
myself it wouldn't be...

1292
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,195
It would be humane."

1293
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:47,133
<i>Well Goldleaf he calls
America a bunch of...</i>

1294
01:15:47,165 --> 01:15:49,235
<i>he calls America
a bunch of female dogs</i>

1295
01:15:49,267 --> 01:15:53,605
<i>and then he says to me,
"Give me 500 rupees."</i>

1296
01:15:53,638 --> 01:15:56,508
But I'm in so much damn pain,
I just don't want to

1297
01:15:56,542 --> 01:15:58,343
be fucked with by this guy.
So I tell him

1298
01:15:58,377 --> 01:16:02,248
in his own language:
"Hey, we may all be dogs, but

1299
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,149
you're a little bitch."

1300
01:16:04,182 --> 01:16:06,084
And he just... He
didn't like that at all.

1301
01:16:06,118 --> 01:16:07,787
He didn't like that at all,
so he fumbles with his keys

1302
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,689
and goes to open the cell door.
And when he came in...

1303
01:16:10,756 --> 01:16:13,559
I mean this guy's
like five foot three,

1304
01:16:13,592 --> 01:16:15,228
he goes in
and hit me with his cane.

1305
01:16:15,261 --> 01:16:18,164
And I grabbed him
and I started punching him

1306
01:16:18,196 --> 01:16:20,467
with his own hand
and then I just lost it.

1307
01:16:21,434 --> 01:16:23,369
<i>I was in so much pain
I just wanted to die.</i>

1308
01:16:23,401 --> 01:16:25,370
<i>At least this way it wasn't
going to be suicide</i>

1309
01:16:25,404 --> 01:16:27,272
<i>but I was gonna
make these guys earn it.</i>

1310
01:16:27,306 --> 01:16:29,642
<i>So that day I
absolutely planned on dying.</i>

1311
01:16:30,708 --> 01:16:32,377
<i>I had a couple
of my ribs broken,</i>

1312
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:33,812
my left shoulder
was collapsed,

1313
01:16:33,846 --> 01:16:36,683
my left eye was closed up.

1314
01:16:37,615 --> 01:16:40,185
They held out my hand and
broke each one of my fingers

1315
01:16:40,218 --> 01:16:43,623
one by one, and when they
started on my left hand,

1316
01:16:45,257 --> 01:16:46,259
they got one of my fingers,

1317
01:16:47,392 --> 01:16:50,695
and when they were about
to move on to my other finger,

1318
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:52,798
the Superintendent
finally showed up

1319
01:16:52,832 --> 01:16:54,834
and asked what
the hell was going on.

1320
01:16:54,867 --> 01:16:59,137
And I heard... I heard Goldleaf
say that they found drugs on me

1321
01:16:59,171 --> 01:17:03,443
that I attacked them.
And I understood all this

1322
01:17:03,476 --> 01:17:04,544
and I told them in their own
language: "Goldleaf's lying."

1323
01:17:06,177 --> 01:17:09,147
I said: "They are stealing money
from me. I'm starving,

1324
01:17:09,181 --> 01:17:11,551
I'm gonna die." And he
comes over and he sees me

1325
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:13,218
and I'm on the ground
and he says:

1326
01:17:13,252 --> 01:17:14,854
"You understand Urdu?"
I said: "Yes sir."

1327
01:17:14,887 --> 01:17:17,090
And he says: "What happened?"
So I get up.

1328
01:17:17,123 --> 01:17:19,325
I'm holding my hand because my
fingers are all fucking jacked.

1329
01:17:20,493 --> 01:17:23,796
I tell him that Goldleaf
wanted 500 rupees from me

1330
01:17:23,829 --> 01:17:25,698
and I told him
to go to hell.

1331
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,300
And then I told him about

1332
01:17:28,333 --> 01:17:30,836
some of the beatings
I'd taken for money

1333
01:17:30,869 --> 01:17:34,106
and how they stole it
from me and he believed me.

1334
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,641
He believed me
and he fired Goldleaf

1335
01:17:35,673 --> 01:17:36,842
right there on the spot.

1336
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:47,486
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, is this Razmik?</i>

1337
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,155
<i>- Yes.
- Oh hi,</i>

1338
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:50,890
<i>my name is
Jamielyn How are you?</i>

1339
01:17:50,922 --> 01:17:54,193
<i>- Very good, thank you.
- Good.</i>

1340
01:17:54,226 --> 01:17:55,795
<i>I'm a
documentary filmmaker</i>

1341
01:17:55,828 --> 01:17:58,665
<i>and I'm making a
documentary about Erik AudÃ©.</i>

1342
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:04,670
<i>- Who's Erik?
- Erik AudÃ©.</i>

1343
01:18:06,538 --> 01:18:07,839
<i>- No, I don't know him.
- Does that...</i>

1344
01:18:07,873 --> 01:18:10,143
<i>That name is not
familiar to you?</i>

1345
01:18:10,176 --> 01:18:15,381
<i>No. No. You
know what? There is a Razmik</i>

1346
01:18:15,413 --> 01:18:18,150
<i>with the same
last name as mine</i>

1347
01:18:18,883 --> 01:18:22,821
<i>and we did
have a few problems.</i>

1348
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:24,924
<i>We went to court for that.</i>

1349
01:18:24,957 --> 01:18:29,227
<i>He was involved with the
drug... you know... smuggling</i>

1350
01:18:29,261 --> 01:18:31,731
<i>people and
lots of other things.</i>

1351
01:18:31,763 --> 01:18:36,636
<i>Many, many collection agencies.
Even like I said.</i>

1352
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:41,640
<i>I've been subpoenaed from
the court, you know, for that</i>

1353
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:44,243
<i>and had to go to court
and show them</i>

1354
01:18:44,275 --> 01:18:46,645
<i>I'm not the person, yeah.</i>

1355
01:18:46,678 --> 01:18:48,413
<i>Okay. Okay so...</i>

1356
01:18:48,446 --> 01:18:50,348
<i>His
name is same as mine,</i>

1357
01:18:50,382 --> 01:18:52,952
<i>his last name is
same as mine. Yeah.</i>

1358
01:18:52,985 --> 01:18:55,421
<i>Well, I'm so sorry
because you probably have to...</i>

1359
01:18:55,454 --> 01:18:57,723
<i>You've been dealing
with this mix up for years.</i>

1360
01:18:57,756 --> 01:19:01,894
<i>So I appreciate you taking my
call and calling me back. We...</i>

1361
01:19:01,927 --> 01:19:03,829
<i>Good luck.</i>

1362
01:19:03,861 --> 01:19:05,631
<i>Thank you
So much, have a great night.</i>

1363
01:19:05,663 --> 01:19:07,599
<i>- Alright, you too. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

1364
01:19:14,472 --> 01:19:16,274
I started cleaning up
the place you know,

1365
01:19:16,307 --> 01:19:17,810
because I figured hey if
I'm gonna be here

1366
01:19:17,842 --> 01:19:20,479
then I might as well make
it look nice.

1367
01:19:21,879 --> 01:19:24,749
So I started fixing
this ugly yard up.

1368
01:19:24,783 --> 01:19:27,887
And it was one afternoon

1369
01:19:27,919 --> 01:19:31,390
that I was working just behind
our cells

1370
01:19:31,422 --> 01:19:34,426
and there's this long path with
all these weeds

1371
01:19:34,459 --> 01:19:36,294
and a couple trees that had been
growing

1372
01:19:36,328 --> 01:19:39,699
and just random flowers
along a border that I made.

1373
01:19:39,731 --> 01:19:43,502
I see this guy I'd never
seen before hop the wall

1374
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:45,770
and he comes walking
right up to me...

1375
01:19:45,803 --> 01:19:49,242
Not really walking at first,
but he gets up and starts...

1376
01:19:49,275 --> 01:19:51,477
He does a little jog. I don't
understand what's going on

1377
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:53,713
but as he's running towards me
I can see it in his eyes

1378
01:19:53,745 --> 01:19:56,582
there's something wrong here.
So I stand up and I get ready.

1379
01:19:56,614 --> 01:19:58,717
And sure enough
he's got a knife in his hand.

1380
01:19:58,751 --> 01:20:00,485
He tries to stab me so I hit him
with a rock...

1381
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:03,555
And I try to grab the knife
out of his hand

1382
01:20:03,588 --> 01:20:06,859
while we were
wrestling for it.

1383
01:20:06,891 --> 01:20:09,327
But he had it out
and I didn't want him to like...

1384
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:11,564
I couldn't get it because I was
on other side of him...

1385
01:20:11,596 --> 01:20:13,665
I didn't want him to stab me in
the leg was the first thing

1386
01:20:13,699 --> 01:20:15,334
I thought because he was
swinging around it everywhere.

1387
01:20:15,367 --> 01:20:17,736
I was using his body
to block me

1388
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:20,839
from his own swinging arm.

1389
01:20:20,873 --> 01:20:23,376
And uh I only meant to throw him
on the ground

1390
01:20:23,409 --> 01:20:24,977
but I ended up uh....

1391
01:20:25,010 --> 01:20:28,814
I sn...

1392
01:20:28,846 --> 01:20:30,448
I snapped his neck

1393
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:35,587
and uh....

1394
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:37,823
And I uh....
He went limp,

1395
01:20:37,855 --> 01:20:40,292
and I got him off of me.

1396
01:20:42,895 --> 01:20:46,665
And uh... I uh...

1397
01:20:46,699 --> 01:20:48,901
I just killed a man in jail.

1398
01:20:48,934 --> 01:20:50,602
I didn't...

1399
01:20:56,574 --> 01:21:00,612
I didn't... I never thought I'd
have to do something like that,

1400
01:21:00,645 --> 01:21:04,582
but uh I just...

1401
01:21:04,615 --> 01:21:07,419
I got away from him
and I was crying.

1402
01:21:07,453 --> 01:21:08,654
I couldn't
control my crying

1403
01:21:08,686 --> 01:21:09,921
because uh...

1404
01:21:11,457 --> 01:21:14,392
I wasn't crying because of...
I just...

1405
01:21:14,426 --> 01:21:16,696
You know you go to jail
for shit.

1406
01:21:16,729 --> 01:21:20,499
For one thing and now
this is way worse.

1407
01:21:30,641 --> 01:21:32,610
When that year
came to an end

1408
01:21:32,644 --> 01:21:36,015
and I just celebrated
being in jail two years

1409
01:21:36,047 --> 01:21:39,084
one of my jobs in jail was
I was a teacher.

1410
01:21:39,118 --> 01:21:40,653
But because
I was a teacher

1411
01:21:40,686 --> 01:21:42,722
I could also get
back over to death row

1412
01:21:42,754 --> 01:21:45,024
to go see my
friend Mourad.

1413
01:21:45,056 --> 01:21:47,693
I get a call
over to death row.

1414
01:21:47,726 --> 01:21:50,930
I get there and Mourad had this
whole meal planned out for us.

1415
01:21:50,962 --> 01:21:53,432
There was chicken there,
there was sweet dishes,

1416
01:21:54,932 --> 01:21:57,470
There were all
these little side dishes

1417
01:21:57,503 --> 01:21:59,004
and I thought alright
cool what's the occasion

1418
01:21:59,037 --> 01:22:01,106
because, you know,
whenever there's a holiday

1419
01:22:01,140 --> 01:22:02,908
there's always food festivities
and everything

1420
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:03,909
or a birthday. No occasion.

1421
01:22:07,012 --> 01:22:10,116
Just wanted to have
a meal with me,

1422
01:22:10,149 --> 01:22:11,883
and this was a great meal.

1423
01:22:11,917 --> 01:22:15,087
I always say outside jail
this is a normal meal

1424
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:17,390
but inside Pakistan
this is a five star meal.

1425
01:22:17,422 --> 01:22:19,425
This is the kind of meal you'd
have to bribe a lot of guards

1426
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:20,360
to make happen.

1427
01:22:22,427 --> 01:22:24,763
Nothing was spicy.
I hated spicy food.

1428
01:22:24,797 --> 01:22:26,932
Mourad knew that
and nothing was spicy.

1429
01:22:26,964 --> 01:22:29,502
And we ate all the food,
we shot the shit,

1430
01:22:29,534 --> 01:22:30,836
we played poker,
we played chess,

1431
01:22:30,869 --> 01:22:32,772
we talked about life.

1432
01:22:32,805 --> 01:22:35,007
I hung out that day,
I hung out a long time that day.

1433
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:37,042
I hung out forever.

1434
01:22:37,074 --> 01:22:42,046
When I got called back
to my cell later on that day

1435
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:44,751
I told Mourad:
"Hey, I'll see you next week."

1436
01:22:45,751 --> 01:22:47,019
He says <i>Inshallah.</i>

1437
01:22:47,052 --> 01:22:49,622
<i>Inshallah</i> means "God willing".

1438
01:22:49,654 --> 01:22:53,124
It's a normal saying
in Pakistan or in Urdu.

1439
01:22:53,158 --> 01:22:55,428
It's "Hey, you'll get out of
here soon, <i>Inshallah."</i>

1440
01:22:55,461 --> 01:22:59,731
Or "Hopefully the judge will go
easy on you soon, <i>Inshallah."</i>

1441
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:03,135
"I'll see you
next week, <i>Inshallah."</i>

1442
01:23:04,101 --> 01:23:08,507
And the next morning
he was hung.

1443
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:13,746
He'd...

1444
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,020
shared his last meal
with me.

1445
01:23:21,052 --> 01:23:23,756
He had it prepared so that
I'd enjoy it not him.

1446
01:23:25,022 --> 01:23:26,057
And...

1447
01:23:29,761 --> 01:23:30,897
And he didn't tell me.

1448
01:23:43,775 --> 01:23:47,812
One day, Joey Paul
Jensen knocks on my office

1449
01:23:47,846 --> 01:23:50,583
and she said:
"You know Sherry

1450
01:23:50,615 --> 01:23:52,851
I have this gentlemen

1451
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:55,820
his name is Scott,
I forget his last name,

1452
01:23:55,854 --> 01:23:58,223
but I have this gentleman

1453
01:23:58,257 --> 01:24:00,125
who went to school with

1454
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,995
the son of the
president of Pakistan,

1455
01:24:04,029 --> 01:24:06,031
Pervez Musharraf's son."

1456
01:24:13,171 --> 01:24:16,008
Mr. Musharraf says to me:

1457
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:18,711
"So what is it
you would like me to do?"

1458
01:24:20,044 --> 01:24:24,249
And I said:
"I have here a letter

1459
01:24:24,283 --> 01:24:27,919
that I would ask that
you present to your brother."

1460
01:24:27,953 --> 01:24:30,189
You know,
president Pervez Musharraf.

1461
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:34,827
"Ask him for
clemency for my son."

1462
01:24:36,093 --> 01:24:39,531
She was using
every resource she had

1463
01:24:39,565 --> 01:24:41,734
just personally,
socially, and financially

1464
01:24:41,766 --> 01:24:44,936
and that wasn't
an endless pipeline.

1465
01:24:44,970 --> 01:24:49,141
And so it was fortuitous
that I knew this person

1466
01:24:49,173 --> 01:24:51,310
that somehow was connected

1467
01:24:51,342 --> 01:24:54,846
in ways that I
couldn't even describe.

1468
01:24:54,879 --> 01:24:58,217
Because I don't even know
if he could even say

1469
01:24:58,249 --> 01:25:00,720
what all of those
connections actually are.

1470
01:25:18,869 --> 01:25:20,605
My foundation,

1471
01:25:20,638 --> 01:25:22,106
the Richardson Center
for Global Engagement,

1472
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:24,642
specializes in
trying to secure

1473
01:25:24,676 --> 01:25:27,747
the release of
prisoners of conscience,

1474
01:25:28,779 --> 01:25:31,684
prisoners of war
from foreign countries,

1475
01:25:31,717 --> 01:25:33,686
from dictatorships.

1476
01:25:33,718 --> 01:25:36,721
We've been doing this
for close to 20 years

1477
01:25:36,754 --> 01:25:38,190
throughout my career.

1478
01:25:38,222 --> 01:25:40,225
And I felt that somehow
somebody had to

1479
01:25:40,257 --> 01:25:41,926
speak up for
this young man.

1480
01:25:41,959 --> 01:25:43,796
The government
was trying to help

1481
01:25:43,829 --> 01:25:46,332
but we have a lot of
interests with Pakistan.

1482
01:25:46,364 --> 01:25:49,367
We're allies,
we have military interests,

1483
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:51,903
intelligence
interests at the time.

1484
01:25:51,936 --> 01:25:56,941
We wanted Pakistan's help
in defeating the Taliban.

1485
01:25:56,975 --> 01:25:59,144
So there was a lot
of security interests

1486
01:25:59,177 --> 01:26:02,381
and sometimes the U.S.
government doesn't want to

1487
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:05,216
get those interests in
jeopardy

1488
01:26:05,249 --> 01:26:09,754
by pressing on the release
of a young man like Erik.

1489
01:26:09,788 --> 01:26:14,727
And I felt that I still had
relationships in Pakistan,

1490
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,928
I'd been there many times,

1491
01:26:16,962 --> 01:26:18,964
I knew high level people.

1492
01:26:18,997 --> 01:26:20,633
They had actually
helped me

1493
01:26:20,665 --> 01:26:22,034
when I was U.N. ambassador

1494
01:26:22,066 --> 01:26:24,035
have a dialogue with
the Taliban

1495
01:26:24,069 --> 01:26:28,106
that resulted in
a short-term ceasefire

1496
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,409
and some advancements.

1497
01:26:30,441 --> 01:26:33,412
And so I knew enough
of the leaders there

1498
01:26:33,445 --> 01:26:36,248
that I got involved.

1499
01:26:36,280 --> 01:26:38,783
I get a visit from my lawyer
and I tell him okay

1500
01:26:38,816 --> 01:26:40,819
we're going to go to the courts

1501
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:43,822
and we're going
to see what we can do.

1502
01:26:45,089 --> 01:26:47,994
As we were coming out
of two-cell and up the path

1503
01:26:48,959 --> 01:26:50,729
one of the deputy
superintendents

1504
01:26:50,762 --> 01:26:52,731
and all his numberdards
started praying for me.

1505
01:26:52,763 --> 01:26:54,999
And literally as I was walking
up to the front of the prison

1506
01:26:55,033 --> 01:26:58,102
all the guards
and different prisoners

1507
01:26:58,136 --> 01:27:01,040
were in unison just giving
me a nice little blessing.

1508
01:27:01,073 --> 01:27:04,843
And I thought to myself
wow this changed.

1509
01:27:04,876 --> 01:27:08,079
When I came in here,
I came in swinging.

1510
01:27:08,113 --> 01:27:12,685
And here I was with
potentially good news

1511
01:27:12,717 --> 01:27:14,452
about to be given to me.
I might be leaving soon.

1512
01:27:14,485 --> 01:27:16,387
And here's everyone
whose attitudes

1513
01:27:16,421 --> 01:27:18,323
have all changed
towards me.

1514
01:27:18,355 --> 01:27:20,291
It felt... It felt good.

1515
01:27:21,258 --> 01:27:24,163
I appreciated that.

1516
01:27:24,195 --> 01:27:27,098
But also I didn't want to
get my hopes up.

1517
01:27:27,132 --> 01:27:31,136
I kept telling myself:
"Erik if it's bad news

1518
01:27:31,168 --> 01:27:33,171
and you to end up
being here for seven years

1519
01:27:33,204 --> 01:27:35,339
you can do it.
Everything's going to be fine.

1520
01:27:35,373 --> 01:27:37,910
You've made a good life
for yourself here."

1521
01:27:38,944 --> 01:27:41,847
I always reminded myself
it could always be worse.

1522
01:27:43,381 --> 01:27:44,950
I just didn't want to
get my hopes up.

1523
01:27:44,982 --> 01:27:47,953
And as I went
into the front office

1524
01:27:47,985 --> 01:27:49,454
and down the hallway

1525
01:27:49,488 --> 01:27:51,390
I started questioning
myself, what if, though?

1526
01:27:51,422 --> 01:27:55,393
What if? What if?
And I go around the corner

1527
01:27:55,427 --> 01:27:57,396
towards
the Superintendent's office

1528
01:27:57,428 --> 01:27:59,198
and it was the prison doctor
that came around the corner

1529
01:27:59,230 --> 01:28:01,966
and was crying, he says:
"Erik, you're going home."

1530
01:28:03,034 --> 01:28:05,104
And I was like:
"Thank you."

1531
01:28:12,377 --> 01:28:14,213
Sherry, what's going
through your head right now?

1532
01:28:14,245 --> 01:28:18,382
Oh I'm... I'm just trying to
hold myself together.

1533
01:28:18,415 --> 01:28:20,351
I can't believe it's
really happening.

1534
01:28:34,266 --> 01:28:35,901
You alright?

1535
01:28:35,934 --> 01:28:37,770
Erik, how
does it feel to be home?

1536
01:28:37,802 --> 01:28:40,805
It's uh, it's new,
it's wonderful,

1537
01:28:40,838 --> 01:28:42,373
The best Christmas gift
I could ever ask for.

1538
01:28:56,387 --> 01:28:57,989
In that moment
when I saw him,

1539
01:28:58,022 --> 01:28:58,923
it was emotional.

1540
01:29:00,324 --> 01:29:02,126
Usually I don't cry.

1541
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:03,494
I'm a military guy
I don't...

1542
01:29:03,528 --> 01:29:05,297
But it was rough.

1543
01:29:07,998 --> 01:29:11,903
So good when I saw him,
I just cried.

1544
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,372
I was overcome, you know.

1545
01:29:14,405 --> 01:29:16,441
We were just completely...

1546
01:29:17,475 --> 01:29:19,912
Our breath
was taken away.

1547
01:29:19,945 --> 01:29:21,547
To be able to
see him in person.

1548
01:29:29,387 --> 01:29:32,324
But I understand that Rai
Ghazarian is out there still.

1549
01:29:50,441 --> 01:29:53,412
If Rai was
sitting here right now...

1550
01:29:54,512 --> 01:29:56,582
Honestly I...

1551
01:29:56,614 --> 01:29:58,050
I don't even know
what I would say.

1552
01:29:58,083 --> 01:30:00,118
I'd be
absolutely disgusted.

1553
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:01,854
I think he's
a horrible person

1554
01:30:01,887 --> 01:30:05,257
that was never punished
for what he did to Erik.

1555
01:30:05,289 --> 01:30:07,959
I think he's heartless

1556
01:30:07,993 --> 01:30:10,529
and I think it's really sad
that he got away with

1557
01:30:10,561 --> 01:30:12,129
what he got away with.

1558
01:30:12,163 --> 01:30:13,566
He hurt a lot of people.

1559
01:30:18,102 --> 01:30:22,073
I hope that God puts him
straight into the Hades.

1560
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:25,343
I was so mad.
I told his mom:

1561
01:30:25,377 --> 01:30:27,479
"Oh my God, I don't
want to see this guy."

1562
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,015
I just don't
want to see him.

1563
01:30:31,016 --> 01:30:32,184
<i>Have
you ever seen him since?</i>

1564
01:30:32,217 --> 01:30:35,087
Oh my God, never, ever.

1565
01:30:35,119 --> 01:30:37,189
I saw him from the gym
before the incident

1566
01:30:37,221 --> 01:30:38,857
and after that never.

1567
01:30:39,556 --> 01:30:42,026
If I saw that guy I wouldn't
let him go with one choke.

1568
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:45,364
I'll be honest with you.
Until they take me into jail.

1569
01:30:45,396 --> 01:30:47,031
Because he was sneaky

1570
01:30:47,065 --> 01:30:48,600
and he was an asshole.
From the beginning

1571
01:30:48,632 --> 01:30:51,269
he was planning to
take that person to prison.

1572
01:30:54,672 --> 01:30:57,008
Lorna and I, we found...

1573
01:30:57,042 --> 01:30:59,177
The private investigator
found the information

1574
01:30:59,209 --> 01:31:03,214
and so we called him
and we spoke to...

1575
01:31:03,248 --> 01:31:05,450
What was it, Lorna, his
girlfriend or something?

1576
01:31:05,482 --> 01:31:08,220
His wife? She said she would
take the number and call back.

1577
01:31:08,253 --> 01:31:11,390
So then I
missed an 8-1-8 number.

1578
01:31:11,422 --> 01:31:13,257
And so then
I call him back

1579
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:15,627
and everything he said,
I have it all recorded,

1580
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:18,963
was to me legitimized
that this definitely

1581
01:31:18,997 --> 01:31:24,336
isn't him and that the P.I. like
this is who they found before...

1582
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:28,439
And so I'm like

1583
01:31:28,472 --> 01:31:32,644
another failed lead
like a dead end of course.

1584
01:31:32,677 --> 01:31:36,181
And then remember how
we found the Linkedin page?

1585
01:31:36,213 --> 01:31:39,016
- Yeah
- So I go to Linkedin

1586
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:41,019
and I wrote him,
let me see...

1587
01:31:41,052 --> 01:31:42,521
"I'm making a
documentary about Erik AudÃ©

1588
01:31:42,553 --> 01:31:44,056
and I'd like
to interview you.

1589
01:31:44,088 --> 01:31:45,457
I would like
to give you a chance

1590
01:31:45,489 --> 01:31:46,524
to tell your side
of the story.

1591
01:31:46,557 --> 01:31:47,959
I can be reached at...

1592
01:31:47,993 --> 01:31:49,261
I look forward to
hearing from you

1593
01:31:49,293 --> 01:31:51,262
and thank you for your time."

1594
01:31:51,296 --> 01:31:57,502
So then, shortly after
I keep checking the message

1595
01:31:57,534 --> 01:31:59,270
because you can see when it's
seen. And I see that it's seen.

1596
01:31:59,303 --> 01:32:04,475
And now his profile
is not available

1597
01:32:04,508 --> 01:32:08,379
and he's completely
deleted himself from Linkedin.

1598
01:32:08,413 --> 01:32:12,317
So he clearly read my message
and he does not want to be found

1599
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:14,086
and he doesn't
want to be part of this.

1600
01:32:14,119 --> 01:32:15,153
And the reason he doesn't
want to be part of this

1601
01:32:15,186 --> 01:32:17,189
is because the judgement,

1602
01:32:17,221 --> 01:32:19,290
the civil suit that
Erik had against him...

1603
01:32:19,324 --> 01:32:22,995
He owes him money
so he wants to stay hidden.

1604
01:32:41,812 --> 01:32:44,082
And then what happened
moving forward

1605
01:32:44,114 --> 01:32:47,519
into present day, did you
guys maintain a friendship

1606
01:32:47,552 --> 01:32:50,556
or try to
have a relationship?

1607
01:32:51,522 --> 01:32:53,357
<i>We
tried shortly, you know.</i>

1608
01:32:53,391 --> 01:32:54,727
<i>We tried when he got home.</i>

1609
01:32:57,494 --> 01:33:01,465
<i>It was hard. I don't
think I fully could be</i>

1610
01:33:01,498 --> 01:33:05,202
<i>the person that he
needed me to be at that point.</i>

1611
01:33:05,235 --> 01:33:08,172
<i>We had these
ideas in our head</i>

1612
01:33:09,306 --> 01:33:11,042
<i>of who the other person was</i>

1613
01:33:11,743 --> 01:33:14,513
<i>and I felt like I could
never live up to the pedestal</i>

1614
01:33:14,546 --> 01:33:16,781
<i>that he kind of put me on.</i>

1615
01:33:16,815 --> 01:33:21,620
<i>And so after he got home
we just ended up fighting.</i>

1616
01:33:21,653 --> 01:33:25,289
<i>'Cause I didn't
feel like I could be...</i>

1617
01:33:25,323 --> 01:33:28,493
<i>I didn't feel like I was
giving him what he needed</i>

1618
01:33:28,525 --> 01:33:31,495
<i>and I didn't feel like
I was getting what I needed.</i>

1619
01:33:36,266 --> 01:33:37,836
My first couple days back

1620
01:33:37,869 --> 01:33:40,138
I wanted to get
my life back together.

1621
01:33:40,171 --> 01:33:44,309
My high school football coach
he let me use his car.

1622
01:33:44,342 --> 01:33:48,312
I asked him... I told him I'd
get it back to him that night.

1623
01:33:48,346 --> 01:33:50,482
He goes: "Just
get your life back."

1624
01:33:50,515 --> 01:33:54,285
So he let me
borrow his car that week.

1625
01:33:55,352 --> 01:33:57,855
And Simo took me out
for lunch, paid for it.

1626
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:59,790
I had no money
in my pocket, nothing.

1627
01:33:59,824 --> 01:34:01,793
And when I was getting back in
my car

1628
01:34:01,825 --> 01:34:04,495
Simo took a hundred bucks out
and he tried to give it to me

1629
01:34:04,529 --> 01:34:07,165
and I wouldn't...
I didn't want to take it

1630
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:09,234
and I wouldn't have
taken it either.

1631
01:34:09,266 --> 01:34:12,104
But he's such a massive man, he
was able to put it in my pocket

1632
01:34:12,137 --> 01:34:15,173
and force me into my car
and close the door.

1633
01:34:15,205 --> 01:34:17,242
And I needed
that hundred dollars.

1634
01:34:17,275 --> 01:34:18,610
He knew I needed it.

1635
01:34:19,543 --> 01:34:21,879
But I saw a sign
off the freeway

1636
01:34:21,913 --> 01:34:25,117
that said
Hollywood Park Casino.

1637
01:34:25,850 --> 01:34:27,651
So I thought, you
know what, I'll kill some time,

1638
01:34:27,685 --> 01:34:30,388
just until
traffic winds down,

1639
01:34:30,421 --> 01:34:32,391
and I'll see what I
can do with fifty dollars.

1640
01:34:34,359 --> 01:34:38,363
I stay all night and I leave
with 2,600 dollars in my pocket.

1641
01:34:39,297 --> 01:34:41,533
Poker just happened
to be my life raft

1642
01:34:41,565 --> 01:34:44,168
to get my back together.

1643
01:34:44,202 --> 01:34:45,904
<i>He
bounced back really quickly</i>

1644
01:34:45,936 --> 01:34:49,673
<i>because he made that a
determination for himself.</i>

1645
01:34:49,707 --> 01:34:53,677
<i>It was a traumatic
experience while he was there</i>

1646
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:56,882
<i>but now he's making the
best of a bad situation.</i>

1647
01:34:58,283 --> 01:35:02,820
<i>I'm just like
really inspired by him.</i>

1648
01:35:02,854 --> 01:35:04,556
That someone can
go through that

1649
01:35:04,588 --> 01:35:07,725
and still come
back the way that he has.

1650
01:35:09,726 --> 01:35:12,897
to see him come back and pick up
where he left off,

1651
01:35:12,931 --> 01:35:16,601
like it was nothing,
well that's admirable.

1652
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:18,837
And I have the utmost respect
for him

1653
01:35:18,869 --> 01:35:20,238
and love for him.

1654
01:35:29,713 --> 01:35:32,850
Erik usually
puts on a stunt happy hour

1655
01:35:32,883 --> 01:35:34,953
every Thursday night
out here.

1656
01:35:34,985 --> 01:35:37,821
This guy
has the heart of

1657
01:35:37,855 --> 01:35:39,524
a diamond and gold combined.

1658
01:35:39,556 --> 01:35:42,626
Extremely friendly.
Extremely kind.

1659
01:35:42,659 --> 01:35:44,395
Introduced me to everybody.

1660
01:35:44,428 --> 01:35:47,966
And the kind of
stunt work I do,

1661
01:35:47,998 --> 01:35:51,269
Normally I don't interact
with guys that look like him.

1662
01:35:51,302 --> 01:35:53,705
So I was a little
nervous coming in

1663
01:35:53,738 --> 01:35:55,472
and he's just a
really friendly guy

1664
01:35:55,506 --> 01:35:56,908
and I've come to
these things ever since.

1665
01:35:56,940 --> 01:35:59,711
And built up
a real good friendship

1666
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:01,813
with the guy.
He's awesome.

1667
01:36:01,846 --> 01:36:05,350
You would never know something
that traumatic happened to him.

1668
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:07,251
And he's
definitely not a bitter guy.

1669
01:36:07,284 --> 01:36:08,819
Quite the opposite.

1670
01:36:08,852 --> 01:36:15,292
Outgoing, non-filtered.
And just... He's awesome.

1671
01:36:15,325 --> 01:36:17,895
Yeah, you couldn't see
that history off of him at all.

1672
01:36:17,928 --> 01:36:20,297
So... I don't know
how he does that.

1673
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:22,234
That makes him
a superman in my opinion.

1674
01:36:22,266 --> 01:36:24,435
When he told me this story
I was thinking:

1675
01:36:24,468 --> 01:36:26,937
There's no way, that can't
be real and you're normal?

1676
01:36:26,971 --> 01:36:30,775
When you go through that kind
of devastation in your life,

1677
01:36:30,807 --> 01:36:32,743
mental torture
and physical torture.

1678
01:36:32,776 --> 01:36:36,381
The combination of the two,
that's hard to put behind you.

1679
01:36:36,413 --> 01:36:38,849
And he's definitely
put it behind him for sure.

1680
01:36:40,584 --> 01:36:43,587
I definitely would say
Erik is a lot stronger

1681
01:36:43,620 --> 01:36:45,990
having gone through
what he's been through.

1682
01:36:46,024 --> 01:36:49,261
I do know that Erik
gets a lot of people that say

1683
01:36:49,293 --> 01:36:52,763
negative things as well.
A lot of people will just

1684
01:36:52,797 --> 01:36:55,367
randomly send him messages
on Facebook or Twitter

1685
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:58,536
and say horrible things,
that they don't believe him,

1686
01:36:58,569 --> 01:36:59,471
that he's a liar,
which I find horrific.

1687
01:37:02,573 --> 01:37:04,876
I don't know how
you could just say that

1688
01:37:04,909 --> 01:37:05,811
to somebody
you don't know.

1689
01:37:06,843 --> 01:37:08,579
For the people out there,

1690
01:37:08,613 --> 01:37:11,850
and they would say:
"Oh, come on

1691
01:37:11,882 --> 01:37:13,885
maybe he knows about it,
he's not stupid."

1692
01:37:15,586 --> 01:37:19,690
Trust me. A zillion percent
he doesn't know.

1693
01:37:21,793 --> 01:37:23,695
<i>You know here's
the reality of it.</i>

1694
01:37:23,727 --> 01:37:25,696
<i>If he knew what he was doing he
would just say it at this point.</i>

1695
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:28,066
<i>He's back here, there's
nothing he can lose, you know.</i>

1696
01:37:28,098 --> 01:37:32,069
And Erik's that guy
where he just...

1697
01:37:32,102 --> 01:37:34,905
He may be a lot of things
but he's not a liar.

1698
01:37:34,939 --> 01:37:36,740
Remember this is
a man of conscience.

1699
01:37:36,774 --> 01:37:38,709
He showed
while he was in prison

1700
01:37:38,743 --> 01:37:41,913
that he wasn't going to plead
guilty even though it meant

1701
01:37:41,945 --> 01:37:43,747
spending more years
in prison.

1702
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:45,417
Here's a man of conscience

1703
01:37:45,449 --> 01:37:46,950
who believed
he didn't do anything wrong.

1704
01:37:46,984 --> 01:37:51,356
He was duped and that happens,
so lay off,

1705
01:37:51,388 --> 01:37:53,024
be compassionate.

1706
01:37:53,056 --> 01:37:55,659
He doesn't let
the negative in his life

1707
01:37:55,693 --> 01:37:58,029
deter him from
his dreams or his goals.

1708
01:37:58,061 --> 01:38:00,464
This is just
chapter two or three

1709
01:38:00,498 --> 01:38:03,068
of like a 12 chapter book
with Erik.

1710
01:38:03,101 --> 01:38:06,671
There's going to be
some monumental things

1711
01:38:06,704 --> 01:38:08,707
that'll happen
with him in the future.

1712
01:38:08,739 --> 01:38:10,742
And I think they're
all going to be good.

1713
01:38:10,775 --> 01:38:12,377
When bad things
happen to me,

1714
01:38:12,409 --> 01:38:14,778
if anything
I just kind of compare it

1715
01:38:14,811 --> 01:38:16,080
to what happened
to me in Pakistan.

1716
01:38:17,547 --> 01:38:19,583
Everything from
this point on in my life

1717
01:38:19,617 --> 01:38:22,521
is nowhere near going
to be where Pakistan was.

1718
01:38:24,489 --> 01:38:27,726
Pakistan has made
everything else in life

1719
01:38:27,758 --> 01:38:28,859
much more tolerable.

1720
01:38:29,961 --> 01:38:31,596
I think I've changed a lot
actually

1721
01:38:31,628 --> 01:38:34,798
since I've been with Erik.
For the good.

1722
01:38:34,832 --> 01:38:39,070
I think I've learned to relax
a little bit more.

1723
01:38:39,102 --> 01:38:42,341
I think I've learned
to laugh a little bit more.

1724
01:38:44,441 --> 01:38:47,445
I definitely learned that
you can get through anything.

1725
01:38:50,515 --> 01:38:52,584
I think you're with the person
you're supposed to be with

1726
01:38:52,617 --> 01:38:54,017
when you're a better person.

1727
01:38:54,051 --> 01:38:55,921
And I think he's
done that for me for sure.

1728
01:38:56,887 --> 01:38:59,490
If you could use five
adjectives to describe him

1729
01:38:59,524 --> 01:39:00,992
what would they be?

1730
01:39:01,025 --> 01:39:05,062
<i>Oh, my gosh...
Crazy.</i>

1731
01:39:05,096 --> 01:39:07,966
<i>But in a good way, loyal...</i>

1732
01:39:07,998 --> 01:39:10,601
- Very straight forward.
- Honest.

1733
01:39:10,635 --> 01:39:12,837
Driven, all cap.

1734
01:39:12,869 --> 01:39:14,972
- Resourceful.
- Hysterical.

1735
01:39:16,606 --> 01:39:18,976
- He loves to laugh.
- He swears like a sailor.

1736
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:21,079
He's always been
a class act to me.

1737
01:39:21,111 --> 01:39:22,814
He is an amazing guy.

1738
01:39:22,846 --> 01:39:24,515
Very smart person too.

1739
01:39:24,548 --> 01:39:25,949
He treats everybody
the same.

1740
01:39:25,982 --> 01:39:28,052
He has a huge heart.

1741
01:39:28,084 --> 01:39:30,154
Definitely warm hearted.

1742
01:39:30,187 --> 01:39:32,190
He's just... He cares
about other people.

1743
01:39:32,222 --> 01:39:35,025
That he's
a caring person for sure.

1744
01:39:35,059 --> 01:39:37,861
He is truly
a man of integrity.

1745
01:39:37,895 --> 01:39:39,064
Unforgettable.

1746
01:39:40,664 --> 01:39:41,766
Unforgettable.

1747
01:39:45,669 --> 01:39:47,905
You know, before I went to jail
I was selfish.

1748
01:39:48,806 --> 01:39:50,074
I was selfish.

1749
01:39:50,106 --> 01:39:52,444
I didn't
appreciate anything.

1750
01:39:52,476 --> 01:39:55,913
I always wanted something that
was just outside of my reach.

1751
01:39:55,946 --> 01:39:58,115
I never
acknowledged what I had.

1752
01:39:58,149 --> 01:40:00,185
If I got a co-star I'd
be like I want a guest star.

1753
01:40:00,217 --> 01:40:02,686
If I get a guest star,
I wish I had a reoccurring.

1754
01:40:04,489 --> 01:40:07,992
Nothing was ever
good enough in my eyes.

1755
01:40:08,025 --> 01:40:10,128
But when I got out of
prison, I had nothing on me

1756
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:11,829
except
the clothes on my back.

1757
01:40:12,963 --> 01:40:14,598
And I felt
richer than anything.

1758
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:16,700
I felt...

1759
01:40:17,834 --> 01:40:20,070
I felt... I mean God
it was amazing.

1760
01:40:20,104 --> 01:40:24,107
That drive back to the city
was just awesome.

1761
01:40:24,141 --> 01:40:26,711
The views,
the music on the radio...

1762
01:40:28,846 --> 01:40:33,985
When I got home

1763
01:40:34,017 --> 01:40:36,753
the things
that really stood out to me

1764
01:40:36,787 --> 01:40:39,723
were...

1765
01:40:39,757 --> 01:40:41,259
Well, English is great,

1766
01:40:41,292 --> 01:40:43,962
People that speak your
language, that's awesome.

1767
01:40:43,994 --> 01:40:46,797
Ice water.
Ice water is gold.

1768
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:52,604
I love ice water. You know,
a standing shower. A toilet.

1769
01:40:52,637 --> 01:40:56,007
I mean this stuff's awesome,
pillows, blankets,

1770
01:40:56,039 --> 01:40:57,708
a real bed.

1771
01:40:57,742 --> 01:40:59,276
Being able to run out
into a cold night

1772
01:40:59,310 --> 01:41:02,814
and run back into a warm room.

1773
01:41:02,846 --> 01:41:04,982
Friends.
Picking up the phone

1774
01:41:05,016 --> 01:41:07,552
and talking to someone
you haven't spoken to in years

1775
01:41:07,584 --> 01:41:09,587
and just catching up
like no time passed.

1776
01:41:10,620 --> 01:41:12,289
A friendly smile.

1777
01:41:12,323 --> 01:41:14,124
A song that
reminds you of someone.

1778
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:18,262
That, you know,
you never could forget about.

1779
01:41:19,896 --> 01:41:23,834
Jokes. Food. Lots of food.

1780
01:41:23,868 --> 01:41:24,870
Everything...

1781
01:41:25,971 --> 01:41:29,007
Everything in our world
is amazing in its own way.

1782
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:31,809
It's something that I would
never have acknowledged

1783
01:41:31,842 --> 01:41:33,144
had I not gone to jail.

1784
01:41:36,898 --> 01:41:39,343

1785
01:41:40,051 --> 01:41:44,623
This year I've
opened up my eighth restaurant.

1786
01:41:51,829 --> 01:41:54,766
I did stuns on<i>
Dunkirk</i> with Chris Nolan

1787
01:41:54,798 --> 01:41:58,136
and got to work with
Bill Paxton on training day

1788
01:41:58,168 --> 01:42:00,671
and did my third
episode of <i>Scorpion</i>.

1789
01:42:05,008 --> 01:42:06,778
So I have a
pretty good life.

1790
01:42:08,279 --> 01:42:10,181
I don't have too many
complaints nowadays.

1791
01:42:10,213 --> 01:42:11,848
I take care of me.

1792
01:42:11,882 --> 01:42:13,985
I don't let people
take advantage of me.

1793
01:42:14,017 --> 01:42:16,119
I play poker,
and I act and do stunts.

1794
01:42:16,153 --> 01:42:18,289
And I travel the world
with my girlfriend.

1795
01:42:18,321 --> 01:42:19,958
And I do pretty well.

1796
01:42:23,961 --> 01:42:25,597
I'm pretty thankful
for what I do have.

1797
01:42:25,629 --> 01:42:27,864
And I just
want to get through this life

1798
01:42:27,897 --> 01:42:29,167
as simply as possible

1799
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:30,334
and be as happy as I can.
