1
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:21,359
[ Whistle ]

2
00:01:27,612 --> 00:01:28,838
[ Whistle ]

3
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,804
[ Whistle ]

4
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,387
Who did that?

5
00:02:00,627 --> 00:02:02,091
Shush.

6
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:10,673
Good morning, Herr Direktor.
- Good morning.

7
00:02:10,968 --> 00:02:13,161
Good morning, Herr Direktor.
Good morning. Good morning.

8
00:02:15,015 --> 00:02:17,470
Good morning, Herr Direktor.
- Fräulein Professor.

9
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:20,715
You're looking very fit.
- I've been for a walk in the mountains.

10
00:02:21,465 --> 00:02:23,862
That's what I should do but I don't
seem to get up early enough.

11
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,687
You're working too hard.
Every night. And so late.

12
00:02:26,997 --> 00:02:29,552
It's finished.
- No. How wonderful.

13
00:02:29,843 --> 00:02:31,843
At three o'clock this morning
I laid down my pen.

14
00:02:32,203 --> 00:02:34,061
At last, the great work
on ancient history ..

15
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:35,898
That the world has been waiting for.

16
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:37,468
Is ready for the publishers.

17
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:39,543
Oh, Stefan, I'm so happy for you.

18
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,689
Oh, I .. I couldn't have
done it without your help.

19
00:02:43,412 --> 00:02:45,415
Oh, the stupid little research I did.

20
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:47,638
No, no. I'm grateful
for all you contributed.

21
00:02:49,842 --> 00:02:51,354
You, uh, walking over?

22
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:55,006
No, my first class isn't until nine.
- Alright. I'll see you at recess.

23
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:06,716
Oh, there you are, Toni.

24
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:11,942
Thank you.

25
00:03:12,702 --> 00:03:14,496
Some men are so stupid.

26
00:03:15,097 --> 00:03:18,317
Meaning anyone in particular?
- Meaning the Herr Direktor.

27
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:20,394
Herr Direktor is a very brilliant man.

28
00:03:20,609 --> 00:03:22,189
Hmm. He's blind.

29
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:24,649
Toni .. that's not very nice of you.

30
00:03:24,968 --> 00:03:26,921
Here he is, year after year.

31
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,856
With his nose in the clouds.

32
00:03:29,241 --> 00:03:32,246
Running the school, teaching
history and writing books.

33
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:34,953
And he don't even see
what goes on around him.

34
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:37,288
What is going on around him?

35
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,316
Oh, all sorts of things.

36
00:03:39,814 --> 00:03:42,443
For example .. you.
- Me?

37
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:45,926
Every morning you come
here and tidy up this room.

38
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,812
Well, it needs a woman's touch.

39
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,955
Yes, but who gets the credit for it?

40
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,325
Me. He thinks I bring
him spring flowers.

41
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,030
Flowers .. ha.

42
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,532
I wonder what kind of
a man he thinks I am.

43
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:02,881
The thing that makes history
interesting is the human element.

44
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:07,248
It isn't so important to know that the
Battle of Philippi was fought in 42 B.C.

45
00:04:07,501 --> 00:04:09,004
As it is to know <i>why</i> it was fought.

46
00:04:10,646 --> 00:04:13,060
We have seen how, after
the Battle of Philippi ..

47
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,285
Antony and Octavius .. might have
divided the world between them.

48
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:21,016
But Mark Antony felt that
his portion of the world ..

49
00:04:21,748 --> 00:04:23,335
Was well lost for love.

50
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,339
At which point history becomes
very human indeed.

51
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:31,372
But unfortunately, the great
romantics are seldom practical men.

52
00:04:31,953 --> 00:04:34,282
And in the end, Caesar
defeated Mark Antony.

53
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,385
Both on land and on sea.

54
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:38,667
As we shall see in our next lecture.

55
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,292
But before I close .. I must read you ..

56
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,062
One of Antony's dying speeches.

57
00:04:45,447 --> 00:04:47,372
From Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra.

58
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,118
I am dying, Egypt. Dying.

59
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:52,625
Only I here importune death awhile.

60
00:04:53,244 --> 00:04:55,779
Until of many thousand
kisses the poor last ..??

61
00:04:56,756 --> 00:04:58,061
I lay upon my lips.

62
00:05:00,164 --> 00:05:02,991
You see, Antony had
fallen upon his sword ..

63
00:05:03,752 --> 00:05:05,263
So he should not be taken prisoner.

64
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:07,884
And now he begs Cleopatra
to remember him ..

65
00:05:08,513 --> 00:05:10,226
As he had once been in her thoughts.

66
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:14,654
That's all for today.

67
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,739
Dr Dominik?

68
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:29,030
Yes?

69
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:31,922
Could you tell me a good
book about Mark Antony?

70
00:05:33,002 --> 00:05:35,462
So you're interested in Mark Antony?
- Yes.

71
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,340
I loved your lecture.

72
00:05:37,706 --> 00:05:39,227
You make everything seem so ..

73
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,838
So exciting.

74
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:44,054
That's very kind of you.

75
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:47,284
Yes, let me see. There's ..

76
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,665
There's Hinckel's Life of Mark Antony.
- How do you spell it, please?

77
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:52,477
I'll write it down for you.

78
00:05:58,904 --> 00:05:59,853
There you are.

79
00:06:00,895 --> 00:06:02,642
You'll find it rather a complete work.

80
00:06:03,436 --> 00:06:05,873
Three volumes.
- They have it in the library?

81
00:06:06,258 --> 00:06:08,156
No. But I'll lend it to you.
I have it at home.

82
00:06:08,371 --> 00:06:09,301
Thank you.

83
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:13,074
I could stop by your
cottage and pick it up.

84
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,943
No, no, no. I'll bring
it to class tomorrow.

85
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,722
Am I being an awful bother?
- Not at all.

86
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:25,097
It will seem strange not to come
for your lectures anymore.

87
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,323
After next week.

88
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:28,460
Yes.

89
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,314
There's always something
sad about graduation.

90
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:36,187
I've been here so long I'm getting to be
an old sentimentalist about the school.

91
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:37,822
Oh, but you're not old.

92
00:06:38,037 --> 00:06:39,821
Hmm. It's nice of you to say so.

93
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:42,271
No, but it makes me
feel old when I think ..

94
00:06:43,248 --> 00:06:45,783
When you first came
to us .. four years ago.

95
00:06:47,097 --> 00:06:48,083
A little girl.

96
00:06:48,928 --> 00:06:51,472
I wasn't a little girl. I was fifteen.

97
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:55,491
Think of it .. an old woman of fifteen.

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,580
I remember you as you looked then.

99
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,002
You had a little what
do you call it, there.

100
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:02,572
A spit curl.
- Yes.

101
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:05,754
I was so proud of that spit curl.

102
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,045
I thought it made me
look .. sophisticated.

103
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:12,975
Oh, funny.

104
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:15,458
They all want to be grown-up.

105
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,858
When there's so much time.

106
00:07:18,656 --> 00:07:20,196
But I am grown-up now.

107
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,309
And after next week.

108
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:25,737
Will you miss me?

109
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:28,751
What? Why yes of course, I'll miss ..

110
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:32,516
I mean to say, I always miss
the graduating classes.

111
00:07:33,183 --> 00:07:34,737
Heavens. I have a faculty meeting.

112
00:08:03,095 --> 00:08:04,137
Marie.

113
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:11,610
What's the matter with you? All you've
been doing is walking around in a daze.

114
00:08:12,634 --> 00:08:13,836
I'm sleepy.

115
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:16,118
She's sleepy.

116
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:21,780
Hey get off, you horse.
Climb off, will you?

117
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,340
What is that, Marie? What is it?
Show it to us. Come on.

118
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,067
It's a picture of a man.

119
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,417
Oh .. my glasses.

120
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,382
I can't see a thing without
my glasses, girls.

121
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,688
My glasses .. my glasses.

122
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:54,505
Where are my glasses, young ladies?

123
00:08:54,975 --> 00:08:57,275
I can't see without my glasses.

124
00:08:57,669 --> 00:09:00,233
Here are your glasses, Frau Wimmer.
- Oh.

125
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:01,801
Oh.

126
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,043
Now.

127
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:08,795
Who did that?

128
00:09:09,433 --> 00:09:11,320
Shush .. who did ..

129
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,780
Shush.

130
00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:24,776
I shall report this entire dormitory.

131
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,311
To the Herr Direktor.

132
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,018
Hello, Anna.
- Hello, Stefan.

133
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:39,547
I was for you.
- Really?

134
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,079
And I've been thinking about you.
- Have you, Stefan?

135
00:09:42,434 --> 00:09:44,142
I was selfish about this book business.

136
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:46,242
There's as much of you
in it as there is of me.

137
00:09:46,492 --> 00:09:49,957
Oh, you needn't thank me, Stefan. I've
been so terribly happy working with you.

138
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:50,840
Oh.

139
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,445
Well, now the book is finished I'm not
letting the partnership finish too.

140
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:57,188
We've got to go on, Anna.

141
00:09:57,742 --> 00:09:59,798
There are other fields
to explore together.

142
00:10:02,277 --> 00:10:04,005
Meaning just what, Stefan?

143
00:10:04,662 --> 00:10:07,394
I mean that we should make our
partnership known to the world .. now.

144
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,694
Will you let me put your
name with mine as co-author?

145
00:10:19,301 --> 00:10:20,766
I'm very grateful to you, Stefan.

146
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,266
'Dominik and Mathe's World
History for Advanced Classes'.

147
00:10:24,481 --> 00:10:26,803
How does it sound?
- It sounds very generous.

148
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:30,296
But after all, what I've done
is of so little importance.

149
00:10:30,511 --> 00:10:33,187
Nonsense, Anna. It was you who
pushed me on and inspired me.

150
00:10:33,854 --> 00:10:36,002
I want you to share
in any glory there may be.

151
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,110
Thank you, Stefan.

152
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,773
You're uncommonly silent, Stefan.

153
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,351
No, I was thinking.

154
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:26,154
Next week's commencement.

155
00:12:26,685 --> 00:12:28,394
Some of these girls
won't be coming back.

156
00:12:29,557 --> 00:12:30,862
And I shall miss them.

157
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm always very sad at
commencement myself.

158
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,754
A boy when he graduates,
is still just a boy.

159
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:41,848
But a girl .. she shakes
herself and stands before you.

160
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:43,905
As a full-fledged woman.

161
00:12:45,585 --> 00:12:46,487
Yes.

162
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,482
And you, my learned colleague?

163
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,116
Huh?

164
00:12:51,566 --> 00:12:53,134
What are you thinking about?

165
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,778
Oh .. my mind was .. far away.

166
00:12:57,773 --> 00:13:00,928
Dreaming of .. other spring.

167
00:13:01,783 --> 00:13:04,658
It is better that old men
should dream of spring ..

168
00:13:05,669 --> 00:13:06,934
Impersonally.

169
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:13,151
Will we draw lots?
- Not me. I wouldn't dare.

170
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:15,790
Oh, scary. Just the four of us then.

171
00:13:16,005 --> 00:13:17,632
And the one who loses has to ask him.

172
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,441
Come on, Marie.

173
00:13:23,013 --> 00:13:25,604
Oh, Marie's it.
- You have to go and ask him.

174
00:13:26,107 --> 00:13:27,898
Oh, but I can't.
- But you've got to.

175
00:13:28,113 --> 00:13:30,352
You took the dare.
- Go on. Be a sport.

176
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,930
You said you would.
Go on, now.

177
00:13:35,911 --> 00:13:38,399
I tell you, schoolgirls
are fiendishly clever.

178
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,814
They'll take every advantage
of a poor, defenceless professor.

179
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,629
And twist him round their fingers.

180
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,859
I'm sorry to interrupt, gentlemen.

181
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:47,338
Well?

182
00:13:47,958 --> 00:13:49,901
Doctor Dominik, will you dance with me?

183
00:13:53,385 --> 00:13:54,967
I don't understand.

184
00:13:55,361 --> 00:13:56,141
I ..

185
00:13:56,995 --> 00:13:58,196
Will you dance with me?

186
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,911
I'm afraid it's not customary.
Not customary at all.

187
00:14:02,534 --> 00:14:04,094
You should know that.

188
00:14:11,069 --> 00:14:12,177
I'm sorry.

189
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:25,486
My dear fellow.

190
00:14:26,189 --> 00:14:29,091
Weren't you a trifle priggish just then?

191
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,448
She shouldn't have done such a thing.

192
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,729
You've hurt the poor child's feelings.

193
00:14:34,508 --> 00:14:36,865
After all .. I am the
director of the school.

194
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:38,945
You might have waited for me.

195
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:41,161
Shush.

196
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:49,137
Marie isn't here.
- No, I don't think so.

197
00:15:54,235 --> 00:15:56,293
Oh, here she is.
- Alright, Marie?

198
00:15:56,631 --> 00:15:57,711
Yes, sir.

199
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:00,039
What happened to her?

200
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,569
Attention!

201
00:16:19,696 --> 00:16:22,118
Salute. One, two, three.

202
00:16:22,954 --> 00:16:26,437
Guard. One, two, three, four, five.

203
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,024
Lunge. One, hold, recover. One.

204
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:34,945
Two calls. One. Assemble.
One, two, three, four.

205
00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:38,756
Salute. One, two, three, four, five.

206
00:16:39,273 --> 00:16:42,783
Guard. One, two, three, four, five.

207
00:16:43,424 --> 00:16:45,752
An advance. Lunge, recover, retreat.

208
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:49,432
Hop, lunge, one, two. Redouble, escape.

209
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,413
One, lunge, recover.

210
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:53,845
Two calls. One. Assemble.

211
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:56,214
One, two, three, four.

212
00:16:56,962 --> 00:17:00,352
Guard. One, two, three, four, five.

213
00:17:01,235 --> 00:17:04,182
Lunge. One, hold, recover. One.

214
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:06,850
Two calls. One. Assemble. One.

215
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:08,802
What is it this time, Stefan?

216
00:17:09,234 --> 00:17:11,788
It's my fountain pen. I have
three, and I can never find one.

217
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:16,099
Well ..
- In Classroom 'B'.

218
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,797
Oh .. I shouldn't like to lose this.

219
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:22,278
It's the one you gave me
at Christmas. I'm very fond of it.

220
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:24,428
Thank you, Stefan.

221
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:28,266
I don't know what I'd
do without you, Anna.

222
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,430
I should never have a fountain pen.

223
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,759
Or a handkerchief.
- Or remember to eat a meal.

224
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,031
No .. or ever publish a book.

225
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:40,722
Herr Direktor .. Herr Direktor.

226
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,506
Something terrible has happened.
- Well, what is it?

227
00:17:44,722 --> 00:17:47,079
Well, wait just a moment
until I get my breath. I ..

228
00:17:47,294 --> 00:17:49,125
I ran all the way upstairs.

229
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:51,849
Hadn't you better sit down?
- Oh, thank you. I ..

230
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:54,957
I'm better now.

231
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,806
It has to do with your class.
- Well, what is it?

232
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,027
After the examination,
when the girls went out.

233
00:18:03,107 --> 00:18:05,878
I carried on a little
investigation of my own.

234
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,047
In my classroom? How strange.

235
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:11,522
Please forgive me. It's a
weakness, you must understand.

236
00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:16,466
During the examination I noticed the
girls were drawing cartoons of me.

237
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:19,132
And passing them around under the desks.

238
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:21,780
They always show me
with teeth like a horse.

239
00:18:26,546 --> 00:18:28,227
Did you find it in the wastebasket?

240
00:18:28,556 --> 00:18:30,717
I found something else
in the wastebasket.

241
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:31,580
What?

242
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:32,809
A love letter.

243
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,815
Oh, well after all, that's nothing.

244
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:39,570
Yes, but <i>what</i> a love letter.
It fairly scorched my fingers.

245
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:41,993
Gussie, are you crazy?
One of my girls?

246
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,087
Yes, one of your girls.

247
00:18:44,312 --> 00:18:46,457
Read it. It's disgraceful.

248
00:18:51,268 --> 00:18:52,981
'My one and only love'.

249
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,098
Hmm .. starts well.

250
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,315
Perhaps I shouldn't read any further.

251
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:03,794
Perhaps it would be better if the
Herr Direktor .. read the rest himself.

252
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,736
Oh, really. I don't see why I ..

253
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:08,262
It's your duty as head of the school.

254
00:19:10,206 --> 00:19:11,173
Well.

255
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:17,436
'I close my eyes to dream of our meeting
that afternoon on Castle Mountain'.

256
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:19,277
Castle Mountain?

257
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,520
Last week. The day of the school outing.

258
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:23,567
But I don't understand it.

259
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:26,337
While the girls and the
faculty were in the village.

260
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,286
This charming creature slipped
away from the others ..

261
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:32,742
To meet some boy with whom
she had a rendezvous.

262
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:35,127
Could that be true?

263
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:37,127
Unfortunately, it looks that way.

264
00:19:38,103 --> 00:19:39,877
Any signature?
- No.

265
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:42,104
The girl who wrote that letter ..

266
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:45,906
Must be brought before
the faculty and punished.

267
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:49,455
Have you a pin?
- No.

268
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:51,775
Very well. I must manage like this.

269
00:19:52,526 --> 00:19:54,048
It is your responsibility.

270
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,095
To the trustees of our school
and the parents of our girls.

271
00:19:58,959 --> 00:20:02,386
I presume you'll let me know.
When the faculty meeting will be.

272
00:20:03,212 --> 00:20:05,653
Yes. Your handkerchief.
- Thank you.

273
00:20:11,492 --> 00:20:15,509
Last night I congratulated myself we had
reached the end of the year without ..

274
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:18,542
Now this thing pops in our faces.

275
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,195
If it's as serious as the letter shows,
do you think we can keep it quiet?

276
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:26,815
With Gussie on the trail?

277
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:30,261
And our delightful humanitarian,
the mathematics professor?

278
00:20:31,262 --> 00:20:34,022
No. They'll demand we make
an example of the girl.

279
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:38,764
Do you recognize the writing?
- Let me see.

280
00:20:40,003 --> 00:20:40,970
Uh ..

281
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:43,364
Hmm, I'm not sure.

282
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,115
I've just been going over some
of the examination papers.

283
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:47,913
But I don't think that ..

284
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:49,887
I hate to do it, but I suppose we must.

285
00:20:56,275 --> 00:20:57,200
No.

286
00:20:59,872 --> 00:21:00,886
Here.

287
00:21:02,116 --> 00:21:03,694
No. It's like it.

288
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,775
But it isn't the same.

289
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,451
Wait .. I think we have it.

290
00:21:15,055 --> 00:21:17,167
Marie Claudel? Oh, no.

291
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,730
Oh, no. She couldn't have done it.

292
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:24,838
Marie Claudel? Are you sure?

293
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:28,997
Yes. Yes, it's the same writing.

294
00:21:32,095 --> 00:21:33,259
Please send for her.

295
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:36,960
One, two, three, four, five.

296
00:21:37,749 --> 00:21:39,279
Seek, lunge, recover.

297
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:42,847
One, two, three, four, five, six.

298
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:46,622
One, two, three, four, five, six.

299
00:21:47,298 --> 00:21:50,087
Guard. One, two, three, four.

300
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:51,994
And advance, double.

301
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:54,350
One and two, three and four.

302
00:21:54,631 --> 00:21:57,289
One and two, three and four. Two calls.

303
00:21:57,627 --> 00:22:00,931
One. Assemble. One, two, three, four.

304
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:02,627
[ Whistle ]

305
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:04,847
Marie Claudel?

306
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:08,500
Report to the Herr Direktor's
office at once.

307
00:22:16,941 --> 00:22:18,311
Herr Direktor sent for me?

308
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:21,673
Yes.

309
00:22:24,812 --> 00:22:26,290
Do you know why I sent for you?

310
00:22:26,661 --> 00:22:27,835
No, Herr Direktor.

311
00:22:28,492 --> 00:22:29,629
Think for a moment.

312
00:22:30,586 --> 00:22:31,882
Well, I've been thinking.

313
00:22:33,346 --> 00:22:37,008
Have you done nothing during the past
few days that is .. unworthy of you?

314
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:43,577
What excuse have you to offer?

315
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:47,181
We drew lots .. we meant no harm.

316
00:22:49,173 --> 00:22:51,474
Who drew lots?
- The girls.

317
00:22:52,244 --> 00:22:54,788
And the one who lost
had to ask you to dance.

318
00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:57,954
I .. I wanted to apologize.

319
00:22:58,471 --> 00:23:00,405
Oh, that? That incident's forgotten.

320
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:03,062
Then why did you send
for me, Herr Direktor?

321
00:23:08,151 --> 00:23:09,719
Do you recognize this writing?

322
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,400
No.
- Look at it carefully.

323
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:18,237
Where did you get it?
- Never mind that.

324
00:23:19,232 --> 00:23:20,659
Did you write it, yes or no?

325
00:23:22,922 --> 00:23:24,030
No, I did not.

326
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:27,905
I want the truth.
- I did not write it.

327
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:33,911
This writing checks, letter for letter,
with your examination paper.

328
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:37,048
But I did not write it.

329
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:41,433
Sit down.

330
00:23:46,674 --> 00:23:48,296
I'm going to dictate something to you.

331
00:23:55,024 --> 00:23:56,218
'My one and only love'.

332
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:57,567
Oh, please.

333
00:23:57,995 --> 00:23:58,678
Write.

334
00:24:07,138 --> 00:24:10,114
'I think of nothing but that beautiful
moment when you held me in your arms'.

335
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:15,596
I order you to write, Marie.

336
00:24:15,904 --> 00:24:16,782
Oh, I can't.

337
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:18,885
Oh, please don't make me.

338
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:21,953
Then you did write this?

339
00:24:23,493 --> 00:24:24,366
Yes.

340
00:24:25,784 --> 00:24:27,155
Oh, I'm so ashamed.

341
00:24:30,723 --> 00:24:32,141
How could it have happened?

342
00:24:32,376 --> 00:24:35,277
Surely you don't believe that
anything like that really happened?

343
00:24:36,854 --> 00:24:38,178
Then why did you write this?

344
00:24:40,234 --> 00:24:42,187
Well, it isn't a real letter.

345
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,187
What is it then?

346
00:24:46,697 --> 00:24:48,294
How can I explain it to you?

347
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:52,031
Well, here inside these walls.

348
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:54,087
I'm still a schoolgirl.

349
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,960
But the moment I step outside.

350
00:24:58,444 --> 00:25:01,365
I feel life around me.
I'm with the world.

351
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:04,360
I feel like other people.

352
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,350
Dream like other people.

353
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:08,960
Then, I am not a schoolgirl.

354
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,439
I'm a human being.

355
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:16,031
But this .. this isn't something
out of your imagination.

356
00:25:16,472 --> 00:25:17,486
It's real.

357
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:21,881
Well, the letter is real.

358
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:24,115
But what it says is not.

359
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:27,900
The only true thing about it.

360
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:31,562
Is that I am in love.

361
00:25:33,676 --> 00:25:34,822
Yes?

362
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:36,684
And in my dreams.

363
00:25:37,257 --> 00:25:40,196
I've been in the embrace of the
man I love. Yes, that's the truth.

364
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,073
But what you accuse me of ..

365
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:44,393
I'm not guilty.

366
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,003
And who is the man?

367
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:50,952
Don't ask me that.

368
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,998
You must tell me.
Who is the man?

369
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:55,983
But I can't answer.
- Very well.

370
00:25:56,885 --> 00:25:59,073
I shall take your refusal
to answer as a confession.

371
00:26:00,903 --> 00:26:03,626
You will appear before a
faculty meeting at .. 5:30.

372
00:26:25,909 --> 00:26:27,994
We all know why this
conference has been called.

373
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,909
By the rules, any member of the faculty
can demand investigation of a student ..

374
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,304
Accused of a serious irregularity.

375
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:38,190
Frau Professor Wimmer
has made that demand.

376
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,730
And I agree entirely
with Professor Wimmer.

377
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:44,998
Too bad you two didn't
meet 20 years ago.

378
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:47,383
I beg your pardon?
- Gentlemen, please.

379
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,227
I prefer not to take any
part of this investigation.

380
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:53,292
I'm only here to see
that justice is done.

381
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,372
First I shall ask for a
report on Marie Claudel.

382
00:27:00,139 --> 00:27:02,318
For the years 1935 and 1936.

383
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:05,351
Marie Claudel has stood
very high in her classes.

384
00:27:05,698 --> 00:27:08,731
We are not here to judge
Marie Claudel's education.

385
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:10,392
It's her morals.

386
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:13,857
Shall we hang the girl,
or just have her beheaded?

387
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:17,913
We all know you've never been much
of a success in maintaining discipline.

388
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:20,579
Your wife must treat you very badly.

389
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:21,725
What?

390
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,420
I've observed that teachers
who are browbeaten at home ..

391
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:26,748
Are inclined to take
their revenge in school.

392
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,273
Please. Let's not make
this a personal thing.

393
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:32,390
Thank you for your protection,
Herr Direktor, but I don't need it.

394
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:34,654
Attacks like that can't hurt me.

395
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:37,490
I'll admit that my wife
is severe with me.

396
00:27:37,734 --> 00:27:39,415
But I am also severe with her.

397
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:41,443
We are a severe family.

398
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:46,195
Our severity towards the world springs
from our own strong convictions.

399
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:49,416
I thought it sprang from
the .. gallbladder.

400
00:27:52,082 --> 00:27:53,904
I don't care to answer that.

401
00:27:55,763 --> 00:27:56,702
Go on, please.

402
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:00,073
Well after all, we
only have this letter.

403
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,632
We have no actual proof that Marie
Claudel is guilty of any wrongdoing.

404
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:06,627
I object to the way you are
beating around the bush.

405
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:09,244
Will Herr Doctor Spindler
kindly tell us exactly ..

406
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:11,866
How you would like this
investigation conducted?

407
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:14,091
Have you sent for her parents?
- No.

408
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:17,922
And why not, may I ask?
- The girl has no father.

409
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,266
Her mother is a hopeless invalid
in a sanatorium at Höflingen.

410
00:28:21,481 --> 00:28:24,016
I suppose that is intended
to prey upon our sympathies.

411
00:28:24,368 --> 00:28:27,960
I don't believe the girl is guilty of
anything but writing a silly love note.

412
00:28:28,495 --> 00:28:30,553
And it was her own private possession.

413
00:28:30,768 --> 00:28:33,887
If anyone is guilty, it's the person who
fished the letter from the wastebasket.

414
00:28:34,102 --> 00:28:35,233
If that is intended ..

415
00:28:35,448 --> 00:28:37,465
Anyone who pokes around
in the garbage can ..

416
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,406
Shouldn't be surprised
when he finds garbage.

417
00:28:40,673 --> 00:28:42,673
So <i>I</i> am the one to be insulted?

418
00:28:43,077 --> 00:28:47,471
Instead of throwing out the girl
who has contaminated our school.

419
00:28:48,339 --> 00:28:50,108
She could scarcely contaminate anyone.

420
00:28:50,756 --> 00:28:52,540
In two days she's graduating.

421
00:28:52,963 --> 00:28:56,474
Apparently the Herr Direktor is more
interested in the girl than the school.

422
00:28:56,925 --> 00:29:00,070
It will be a reflection on the school
if she's expelled before graduating.

423
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:05,460
If I have anything to say to it,
she will <i>not</i> be allowed to graduate.

424
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:08,277
Well, you talk about this girl
as if she were a criminal.

425
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:12,962
The letter admits she had a rendezvous
with a man on .. Castle Mountain.

426
00:29:13,563 --> 00:29:15,704
What more do you want?
A photograph?

427
00:29:16,117 --> 00:29:18,333
Well after all, she's 19 years old.

428
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:20,725
At that age, my mother
already had two children.

429
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,173
Not in school.

430
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,442
Nature doesn't care anything
about the location.

431
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:28,888
You're just trying to keep us
from questioning the girl.

432
00:29:29,174 --> 00:29:30,590
We won't hinder you any further.

433
00:29:30,821 --> 00:29:32,981
Since you insist, you can begin
the inquisition yourself.

434
00:29:33,298 --> 00:29:33,942
Toni.

435
00:29:37,106 --> 00:29:38,773
Please ask Marie Claudel to come in.

436
00:29:39,294 --> 00:29:40,223
Just a moment.

437
00:29:41,481 --> 00:29:45,397
Have you ever noticed any boys hanging
around outside, waiting for the girls?

438
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:48,026
Well, yes.

439
00:29:48,636 --> 00:29:52,402
There's one good-looking young fellow
that waits every day at the corner.

440
00:29:52,618 --> 00:29:54,947
Uhuh .. and do you know
for whom he waits?

441
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:58,345
Certainly.
For Frau Professor Wimmer.

442
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:02,148
You idiot.
That's my nephew.

443
00:30:02,562 --> 00:30:04,750
Well, I didn't say he
was your sweetheart.

444
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:08,497
Now, now. Gentlemen, please.

445
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:14,834
They want you, Mademoiselle.

446
00:30:16,243 --> 00:30:18,881
Don't worry. They can't eat you.

447
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:43,535
Will you come over here, please?

448
00:30:48,785 --> 00:30:52,043
Certain members of the faculty
wish to ask you some questions.

449
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:55,686
Dr Spindler?

450
00:30:57,245 --> 00:30:58,503
Come here.

451
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:01,640
Closer.

452
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:03,810
You're 19 years old?
- Yes, sir.

453
00:31:04,025 --> 00:31:05,466
French, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

454
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,681
Fond of the company of
young men, I presume?

455
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:10,579
Do you enjoy dancing?
- Just as any girl.

456
00:31:11,189 --> 00:31:13,443
Are you wearing perfume?
- No, sir.

457
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:15,236
Don't lie. I can smell it.

458
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:17,869
You are aware that perfume
is not allowed in this school.

459
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,739
It's not perfume.
- What is it then?

460
00:31:19,954 --> 00:31:20,624
Soap.

461
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:23,246
So .. you washed with perfumed soap?

462
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:25,425
I can't see that that
question belongs here.

463
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,092
It belongs in the analysis
of the girl's character.

464
00:31:28,731 --> 00:31:29,980
Give me your handkerchief.

465
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,081
Frau Professor, will you ..?
- I'm here.

466
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:35,316
Wet your lips.

467
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:37,389
If you please, I ..
- Wet your lips.

468
00:31:41,707 --> 00:31:44,214
Ah .. lip rouge.

469
00:31:44,622 --> 00:31:46,482
I think we have a rule about that.

470
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:48,537
Please get on with your questioning.

471
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:52,380
Do you remember the
school outing last week?

472
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,951
Yes.
- What day was it?

473
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:55,426
I'm not ..

474
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:57,721
You do recall being in the
village with the others?

475
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:58,553
Yes.

476
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:01,409
Did you once leave the other girls?
- Well, I ..

477
00:32:01,624 --> 00:32:03,382
Tell the truth.
- Then give me a chance.

478
00:32:03,597 --> 00:32:05,721
Don't dare address me
in that tone of voice.

479
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:08,980
Were you or were you not absent
at any time from the others?

480
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:12,642
Well, yes .. I took a walk.

481
00:32:13,506 --> 00:32:15,553
Ah .. she took a walk.

482
00:32:16,248 --> 00:32:18,615
On Castle Mountain, wasn't it?
- Yes.

483
00:32:19,488 --> 00:32:21,704
And you were with a man there?
- No.

484
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:24,596
You did not meet a man
on Castle Mountain?

485
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,113
Herr Doctor Spindler,
your attitude isn't helping any.

486
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:31,038
Since you refuse to answer, I shall tell
you what happened on Castle Mountain.

487
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:34,136
I shall reconstruct
your little adventure.

488
00:32:34,868 --> 00:32:37,579
You slipped away from the rest of the
girls because you had a rendezvous.

489
00:32:37,881 --> 00:32:38,782
That's untrue.

490
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:40,773
You met him in the forest.
In the shadows.

491
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:42,903
Where you felt safe from prying eyes.

492
00:32:43,526 --> 00:32:45,179
You were alone in the forest.

493
00:32:45,742 --> 00:32:46,878
Alone with a man.

494
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:50,076
And all about you the soft,
sweet smell of spring.

495
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:50,890
No.

496
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,783
He held you in his arms. He kissed you.

497
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:54,898
Stop! I won't listen to you.

498
00:32:55,433 --> 00:32:57,254
What?
- I hate you.

499
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:59,518
Every girl in this school hates you.

500
00:32:59,733 --> 00:33:03,310
You've always picked on me.
You, you filthy old pig.

501
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:05,591
I don't blame her.
- Now, here, here.

502
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:08,943
I demand she apologize.
- You brought it on yourself.

503
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:11,440
So that's it. Taking her side, eh?

504
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:15,722
Aren't you making yourself ridiculous?
- I intend to see this case through.

505
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:18,698
I'll break down your impudent
defiance, young woman.

506
00:33:19,112 --> 00:33:20,774
I'm going to send for your mother.

507
00:33:21,675 --> 00:33:22,755
My mother?

508
00:33:23,121 --> 00:33:26,379
They're sending for her mother.
- They're going to send for her mother.

509
00:33:26,623 --> 00:33:28,482
Perhaps you'd like
her to read this letter?

510
00:33:29,552 --> 00:33:30,716
Oh, but you can't.

511
00:33:31,308 --> 00:33:32,998
Not my mother.
- Hmm.

512
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:35,618
But I couldn't have her know.

513
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:39,252
But my mother is very ill,
and .. and she loves me.

514
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:41,187
She believes in me.

515
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:44,445
I'm all she has.

516
00:33:45,806 --> 00:33:47,656
Oh, please don't let him tell my mother.

517
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:51,233
She graduated from this
school, and she loved it.

518
00:33:52,313 --> 00:33:55,778
And ever since I was born, she dreamed
of the day I should graduate too.

519
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:00,209
She's dreaming of that now,
this minute, while I stand here.

520
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,149
And if you turn me out
in disgrace, it would ..

521
00:34:05,853 --> 00:34:08,505
It will kill her, I know it will.
- Rubbish.

522
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:12,731
I'll resign from the school. I'll go
away if you won't tell her why.

523
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:16,900
Oh, please, Dr Dominik. Let me do that.

524
00:34:17,331 --> 00:34:19,105
You think we'd let you resign now?

525
00:34:19,331 --> 00:34:21,969
Oh, no.
We'll make an example of you.

526
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:25,490
This case is going before the trustees.
Your mother will be there to hear it.

527
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:28,354
All right .. I'll explain.

528
00:34:29,556 --> 00:34:31,086

Let me talk to Fräulein Mathe now.

531
00:34:36,795 --> 00:34:37,997
She'll understand.

532
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,973
Well, it is a little .. irregular.

533
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:46,452
Irregular? It's impossible.

534
00:34:47,531 --> 00:34:49,737
Don't you see?
This in itself is an admission.

535
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,160
What is it that cannot be said
in the presence of everyone?

536
00:34:53,874 --> 00:34:55,432
Why should <i>one</i> teacher be told?

537
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:58,362
Perhaps because that teacher's
a woman, Herr Dr Spindler.

538
00:34:58,756 --> 00:35:00,813
And am I not a woman too?

539
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:07,898
Why not do as she asks?
What harm will it do?

540
00:35:08,114 --> 00:35:10,302
Who is in authority here,
the teachers or the pupils?

541
00:35:10,517 --> 00:35:11,982
I am in authority, Herr Spindler.

542
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:14,620
Very well.

543
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,282
Fräulein Mathe.

544
00:35:16,601 --> 00:35:18,329
We shall await your recommendation of ..

545
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:21,315
Expulsion .. or exoneration.

00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:22,893
Come along, Marie.

547
00:35:23,108 --> 00:35:24,215
Your reason for this?

548

Oh, sit down, Spindler. Be quiet.

- Danke schön.

550
00:35:37,732 --> 00:35:39,188
I'm not your teacher now, Marie.

551

I'm your friend.

552
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,187
Oh, it's so hard to say, even to you.

553
00:35:45,741 --> 00:35:48,511
Whatever it is, you mustn't
be afraid to tell me.

554
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:55,364
It was wrong to write what I did, but ..

555
00:35:57,298 --> 00:35:58,763
Is it wrong to love him?

556
00:36:01,179 --> 00:36:03,020
But you're so young, Marie.

557
00:36:03,902 --> 00:36:04,682
Young.

558
00:36:08,596 --> 00:36:10,812
That letter was something
I wished were true.

559
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:13,282
And in writing it.

560
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:16,099
I seemed to make it <i>come</i> true.

561
00:36:18,503 --> 00:36:20,066
You know how it is, Fräulein Mathe?

562
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:22,897
When you hope for something.

563
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:28,625
And even though it seems impossible,
you keep on hoping .. and hoping.

564
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,667
And that hope keeps you alive.

I know.

566
00:36:37,545 --> 00:36:39,733
I can't tell him, don't you see?

567
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,263
But I knew that you would understand.

568
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:50,660
It seems silly to you?

569
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:53,468
Maybe you want to laugh?

570
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,550
Just as he probably would.

571
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:57,105
If he knew.

572
00:36:58,407 --> 00:37:00,032
No, darling. I don't want to laugh.

573
00:37:01,102 --> 00:37:02,407
And you'll help me?

574
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:05,769
My mother mustn't know.

575
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:08,370
She won't know.

You wait here.

577
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,467
We understand so well.

578
00:37:15,129 --> 00:37:16,670
Everything's going to be alright.

579
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:19,406
You and I have got a secret between us.

580
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,242
You're not angry with
me, Fräulein Mathe?

581
00:37:24,688 --> 00:37:26,520
For loving Stefan Dominik?

582
00:37:28,961 --> 00:37:30,069
No, Marie.

Five minutes, eh?
- Five minutes and 43 seconds.

The child is no more to blame than I am.

586
00:37:47,801 --> 00:37:49,744
And the letter?
- Yes, the letter.

587
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,904
How does she account for that?

588
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:54,458
It was merely a literary composition.

589
00:37:55,216 --> 00:37:57,113
You ask us to believe that?

590
00:37:57,967 --> 00:38:00,615
There is no moral wrong
here, Herr Direktor.

591
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:04,004
Marie merely wrote a poetic
letter to an imaginary friend.

592
00:38:04,981 --> 00:38:07,215
Is that her explanation?
I mean, is that what she told you?

593
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,100
Uhuh.

594
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:10,561
I don't believe it.
- Nor I.

595
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,687
Either she has hoodwinked
you into accepting her lie.

596
00:38:14,222 --> 00:38:15,650
Or you're her confederate.

597
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:18,464
I still demand that this
case go before the trustees.

598

And that the girl's mother be sent for.

599

The child has done nothing
wrong Herr Direktor, believe me.

I believe you.

Then I'll go over your head.

I'll go to the trustees myself. Let them
decide who is right and who is wrong.

The girl's mother <i>will</i> be sent for.

- They sent for Marie Claudel's mother.

Oh. They sent for
Marie Claudel's mother.

No.

Oh, it's a shame.

Is there anything we can do to help?
- The pigs.

They're sending for my mother.

613
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:11,434
Oh, that's terrible. Your mother
graduated from here too, didn't she?

Let's go down to supper, darling.
You'll feel better.

We'll see you later.
- Oh, I haven't any appetite.

00:39:38,604 --> 00:39:40,896

to the Herr Direktor.

In the state of mind she
was in, she might ..

00:40:26,714 --> 00:40:29,710
Now think. When did any
of you see Marie last?

631
00:40:30,948 --> 00:40:31,816
Since when?

632
00:40:32,031 --> 00:40:34,405
Not since she heard they were
going to send for her mother.

I just saw Marie going through

Why didn't you stop her?
- What am I, a policeman?

- Very much.

00:59:44,103 --> 00:59:45,502
Jacques, we must hurry.

875
00:59:45,737 --> 00:59:47,042
You'll excuse us, please.

876
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,598
But why did you introduce
me as your fiancée?

877
01:00:00,929 --> 01:00:02,783
A fine way to treat a poor cousin ..

878
01:00:02,998 --> 01:00:05,186
Who drove all the way from Paris
just to see you graduate.

879
01:00:07,054 --> 01:00:08,534
Pardon me, Herr Direktor.

880
01:00:09,217 --> 01:00:10,426
They're waiting for you.

881
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:14,878
Very well, Toni. Thank you.

882
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:23,638
Well, it's a long story.

883
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:27,524
Perhaps one day .. I'll tell it.

884
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:53,054
Graduation is a milestone.

885
01:00:53,345 --> 01:00:55,983
Which marks a definite stage
in your journey through life.

886
01:00:57,777 --> 01:01:01,382
It marks the end of a certain
cycle in your existence.

887
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:04,302
And the beginning of another cycle.

888
01:01:06,152 --> 01:01:09,128
For your friends on the
faculty it marks a cycle too.

889
01:01:10,765 --> 01:01:12,868
We must stay in our smaller world.

890
01:01:13,995 --> 01:01:15,948
While you go out to a larger world.

891
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:18,380
And a wider opportunity.

892
01:01:20,173 --> 01:01:21,516
For these four years ..

893
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,962
We have guarded you .. worked with you.

894
01:01:26,324 --> 01:01:27,892
Watched you grow from childhood ..

895
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:30,606
To young womanhood.

896
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:33,639
And now that you are leaving us.

897
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:37,554
Each of you will carry away,
something of ourselves.

898
01:01:41,132 --> 01:01:43,001
And will leave behind a vacancy ..

899
01:01:44,165 --> 01:01:46,926
Small or large, according
to our interest in you.

900
01:02:39,087 --> 01:02:42,891
<i>All hail Alma Mater</i>.

901
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:46,229
<i>Proudly we sing</i>.

902
01:02:48,894 --> 01:02:52,768
<i>Of sorrows .. and glories</i>.

903
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:58,615
<i>Which thy learning bring</i>.

904
01:02:59,743 --> 01:03:04,054
<i>Forever in our memories</i>.

905
01:03:04,895 --> 01:03:08,560
<i>Our hallowed love will burn</i>.

906
01:03:10,085 --> 01:03:12,649
<i>For thee .. Alma Mater</i>.

907
01:03:16,737 --> 01:03:20,814
<i>Ever we will yearn</i>.

908
01:03:36,451 --> 01:03:37,991
That is very funny.

909
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:39,756
Shall we dance?
- Yes.

910
01:03:43,681 --> 01:03:46,263
What will it take to cheer you up?
A diamond bracelet?

911
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:48,930
A million francs?
Or a dance with me?

912
01:03:49,878 --> 01:03:51,222
I don't feel like dancing.

913
01:03:51,992 --> 01:03:53,475
Have a drink of Champagne.

914
01:03:54,442 --> 01:03:57,352
Or, maybe I could entertain
you with a few .. card tricks?

915
01:04:02,531 --> 01:04:03,347
Marie.

916
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:06,080
Will you dance with me?

917
01:04:11,286 --> 01:04:12,206
Stefan.

918
01:04:14,037 --> 01:04:15,418
I went to your house.

919
01:04:15,803 --> 01:04:17,652
Your mother told me I
should find you here.

920
01:04:37,829 --> 01:04:39,631
You ran away from me once before.

921
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:42,861
But what you told me that
day was not the truth.

922
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:47,124
Look at me.
- No, please.

923
01:04:49,443 --> 01:04:51,321
Why did you come here?
- I had to.

924
01:04:52,729 --> 01:04:54,466
It wouldn't work out any other way.

925
01:04:55,076 --> 01:04:56,043
I knew it.

926
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,907
And Anna knew it.

927
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:08,490
Isn't it strange how professors
can be so pitifully stupid?

928
01:05:09,626 --> 01:05:12,565
It's taken me all these weeks to find
out that the only answer to the problem.

929
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:15,391
Is you.

930
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:19,823
I could have told you that.

931
01:05:48,001 --> 01:05:48,669
You.

932
01:06:22,157 --> 01:06:22,860
..t-g..
