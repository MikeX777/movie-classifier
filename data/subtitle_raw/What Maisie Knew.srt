1
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,448
You want to sleep
with Mommy tonight?

2
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,568
Mm-hm. In my bed?

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,926
Mm-hm.

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,207
You promise
not to kick me?

5
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,602
I promise.
Yeah, okay.

6
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,604
Shall I sing to you? Yeah.

7
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,523
Yeah?
Mm-hm.

8
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,364
What song?

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,568
One of your songs.

10
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,168
Oh, well, sugar, those aren't really
meant to put people to sleep.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,281
What did you sing me
when I was little?

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,364
Um, like, you know,
Rock-a-bye Baby.

13
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,244
That's for babies.

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,243
So?

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,642
"When the wind blows
The cradle will rock"

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,644
"When the bough breaks
The cradle will fall"

17
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,441
"Down will come baby
Cradle and all"

18
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,371
Are you sleepy?
A little.

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,046
Why don't you just close
your eyes and try, okay?

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,691
Okay. Okay.

21
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,682
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

22
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,603
I'll help you
fall asleep.

23
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,207
"Rock-a-bye baby"

24
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,080
"On the tree top"

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,801
"When the wind blows"

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,124
"The cradle will rock"

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,001
"When the bough breaks"

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,722
"The cradle will fall"

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,243
"And down
Will come baby"

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,450
"Cradle and all"

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,083
Pizza man.

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,365
Hi.

33
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,284
Hi. Can you sign this, please?

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,562
Sure.
Wait for me.

35
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,083
Pizza man's here.

36
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,961
You haven't had a creative
thought in your life.

37
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,327
What have you done in
the last five years?

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,131
How jealous you are.
I'm jealous?

39
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,644
There's your tip.
Thanks.

40
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,610
You're welcome.
Goodnight.

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,887
I've-I've done
my mid-life crisis.

42
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,644
You should get on with yours.
What?

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,883
Don't talk to me
that way.

44
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,962
You want to play
Tic-tac-toe?

45
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,202
Sure.

46
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,442
Why don't we eat outside?

47
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,329
Okay?

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,971
Walk a way
like you always do.

49
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,570
Hey, can I have some pizza?

50
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,808
Sure.
Mm-hm.

51
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,085
Mm. Nice.

52
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,242
Tic-tac-toe.
Look, I won.

53
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,005
Come on, Maisie,
you didn't let me play.

54
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,650
Look at me.

55
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,888
You're cheating.

56
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,928
Maisie,

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,288
do you ever wonder what
Margo thinks of us

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,045
behind that
hauntingly calm exterior.

59
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,565
Okay. Enjoy-

60
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,369
Do you want to be"Xes"or"Os"?

61
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,489
Um, I want
to be"Os".

62
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,045
The ants go marching one by one.

63
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,851
Hurrah, hurrah.

64
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,651
The ants go marching one by one.

65
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,451
The little one stops
to suck his thumb.

66
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,722
You're a
liar and a thief.

67
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,962
This is a colossal
waste of time. Fine, go.

68
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,767
Hey.
Hi.

69
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,804
Susanna.

70
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,962
Is that Daddy?

71
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,247
Shh, go back to sleep.

72
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,885
Open the door.

73
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,808
Open the damn door.
Damn.

74
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,451
Stop making
that fucking noise.

75
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,726
They hate me
in this building.

76
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,609
Oh, there you are.

77
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,250
At last.

78
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,641
Open the door.

79
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,211
Susanna.
Go away.

80
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,203
Open the door.

81
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,320
No.

82
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,562
Open the fucking door.

83
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,246
Not this time. I told you it
would happen if you left.

84
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,049
What?
Are you serious?

85
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,963
Yes, I'm serious.
It's my apartment.

86
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,690
Open the goddamn door.
No.

87
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,801
You're a fucking headcase.
Fuck you!

88
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,885
Now, remember
your soil should be damp,

89
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,645
not soaked.

90
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,003
You father's here.

91
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,163
Maybe your dog died.

92
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,924
I don't have a dog.

93
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,083
You're never
going to lose money

94
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,128
on art
unless you overpay.

95
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,964
This is a good price.

96
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,010
I need to know if you
want the paintings,

97
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,731
I need to know ASAP. Let me
just get rid of this call.

98
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,370
One second.

99
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,249
Here is this month's schedule.

100
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,482
We would prefer if you'd
wait the few extra minutes

101
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,164
until the end
of the school day

102
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,844
so that we don't have
to interrupt class.

103
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,729
Okay. Okay,
I'll make sure

104
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,087
that absolutely
doesn't happen again.

105
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,209
Listen, why don't you and me go and
get ourselves a nice double espresso?

106
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,044
With Mommy?

107
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,168
No, no, just you and me this time.
Eh? Fun, huh?

108
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,447
Hey, so they're exemplary pieces-

109
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,524
Are you kidding me? What were you going to do?
Take her to Argentina?

110
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,843
I'll call you back. People, just
do I need to get some help?

111
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,810
No. This is not a game, Beale.
Come on, baby.

112
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,201
Daddy's not going
to pick you up anymore.

113
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,328
I'm just going to pick you up, okay?
Are you okay?

114
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,602
It's okay.
I'm only her father.

115
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,004
Wow, Pooh, you have
your own TV?

116
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,367
Yeah, we can watch it later.

117
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,680
Hey, cool. A little monkey.

118
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,444
What a lovely room.
Thanks.

119
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,965
Need anything before I go?

120
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,805
No, I'm all set, thanks.
Bye.

121
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,965
Zoey, I want you to listen to Maisie's
mother, otherwise I'm going to come back

122
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,042
and there's not going to be
a sleepover, all right?

123
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,925
Okay. Look.

124
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,811
Okay, on the crown.

125
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,963
Icing. Icing really hot.
You got it?

126
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,724
You got the icing?

127
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,167
Candy.
Oh, candy.

128
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,651
Woo!

129
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,569
Look at that slide.
Slow move.

130
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,644
Now put the...

131
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,449
fourth one on me.

132
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,122
Oops, sorry.

133
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,726
Look. It's red, white, and green.

134
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,131
Wow.

135
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,565
Let's go back inside.

136
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,166
Hey, listen to this.
You guys hear that?

137
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,242
I really love how he
weighs back on the beat.

138
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,163
Yeah, just want to get down.

139
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,844
That's you.

140
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,611
Yeah, yeah, it's good. Yeah.

141
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,249
I'm going to find a whiskey.

142
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,721
"Hook and line I still blow away"

143
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,162
"With your Hook and line I still blow away"

144
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,840
"With your Hook and line I still blow away"

145
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,248
"With your Hook and line I still blow away"

146
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,124
Zoey.

147
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,288
Don't cry, Zoey.

148
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,085
Oh.

149
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,367
This is the heart line.

150
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,048
And you're going to meet
a very interesting man.

151
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,451
Extraordinary.

152
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,210
Oh, hey.
You're back.

153
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,964
Hon, you're supposed to be in bed.

154
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,964
Zoey's crying.

155
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,729
Oh.
I'm really sorry.

156
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,450
Hey, at this age-

157
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,285
Yeah, you know, at
this age they don't-

158
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,886
Um, all right.

159
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,644
Thanks for coming.

160
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,371
Goodnight.
Go.

161
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,011
Bye, Zoey.
Bye.

162
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,560
Bye, Zoey.

163
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,483
Go back to bed, baby,okay?

164
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,769
So much for them testifying for me.

165
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,127
Fuck it.

166
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,521
The mom's a total Nazi anyway.

167
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,209
Okay, Maisie, come on, which one?

168
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,846
That one.

169
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,320
You dressed yet?

170
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,801
We don't have time for that.
We're late.

171
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,087
Here.
Put these on.

172
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,851
Okay.

173
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,126
You can definitely mention
the time he threw you.

174
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,884
He did?
Oh, my God, yeah.

175
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,644
He threw you across the room

176
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,961
onto the couch yelling in your face.

177
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,088
Jesus.
Don't you remember?

178
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,243
It was like your most
earth-shattering moment.

179
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,331
Maisie?

180
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,324
Do you and your mom
sing together sometimes?

181
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,243
Sometimes.

182
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,731
Is it fun?

183
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,649
I hope you get what a farce this is.

184
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,529
It's ridiculous.
We're not even married.

185
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,728
And listen, you know,
whatever he says-

186
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,007
be sure to factor in thirty
years of substance abuse.

187
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,681
Do you want the chicken?
Uh-huh.

188
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,603
Okay. Might be a little bit spicy.

189
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,843
How does that happen?

190
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,884
Here you go.

191
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,847
Hello?

192
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,689
If you think it's all right.

193
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,003
Your dad's coming up.

194
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,686
Hey.

195
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,246
Oh, my sixth favorite girl.

196
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,810
Who's your other girls?

197
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,291
Oh, I can't tell you about those.

198
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,328
Why not?
It's a secret.

199
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,404
Do you want
some Mandarin chicken?

200
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,921
Mm, that sounds good.
Hi.

201
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,963
I think she's coming back soon.
I know.

202
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,122
I'm going to grab a few
things and then we'll, uh,

203
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,884
we'll keep this our little secret.

204
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,247
Don't want to get Margo
decapitated, no?

205
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,049
Uh-uh.

206
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,531
Okay.

207
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,967
Okay, I got to dash.

208
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,169
But don't worry.
I'm fixing things, okay?

209
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,045
And, uh, thank you.

210
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,929
You're one in a million.

211
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,051
Hey.

212
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,804
Okay, thanks.
You're a prince.

213
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,690
That's Byron downstairs.
She's on her way up.

214
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,247
Hey, up, up, up.
Come on.

215
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,482
The doors don't open
until ten after eight.

216
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,166
I've got to be at court
in 15 minutes.

217
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,681
All right, I guess she can come in.
Thanks.

218
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,762
Love you.

219
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,326
My mum says you're
supposed to come with me.

220
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,081
To your house? No, we're
going to walk you home.

221
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,646
Bye.
Bye.

222
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,531
Hi, Maisie.

223
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,806
Hi, Byron.

224
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,008
You're not capable
of taking care of a child.

225
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,282
You know better.
No, I know you.

226
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,362
Really?
Yes, yes.

227
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,283
I know you.

228
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,840
Susanna, you don't know
anyone except yourself.

229
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,163
You breathe pain wherever you go.
Shut up, shut up.

230
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,369
That's why the judge and
the expert, they saw that.

231
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,442
They saw you.
No.

232
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,443
Then why are they not
giving you sole custody?

233
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,727
Because you got a female
judge, that's why.

234
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,087
If that's what you want to
tell yourself, then fine.

235
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,004
Don't take her, man.
I'm not taking her.

236
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,646
Don't take her. I'm not taking her.
They gave her to me.

237
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,409
Hey.
Hey, baby.

238
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,209
Just the person we want to see.

239
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,686
Honey, why don't you get
some clothes and things

240
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,285
and stuff to take with us?

241
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,208
Just do it.

242
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,086
It's okay.
It's okay.

243
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,609
She doesn't need you telling her
what I say is okay, asshole!

244
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,001
Temper, temper.

245
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,042
There you go.

246
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,603
I'm right behind you.

247
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,602
Hi, Maisie.
Hi.

248
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,609
Can I take your bag?

249
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,609
You want to see your room?

250
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,370
So, what do you think?

251
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,246
You know, you have Margo to thank

252
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,927
for... most of the stuff.

253
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,005
Why don't I let you two catch
up on the world events?

254
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,209
So,

255
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,521
you surprised to see me?

256
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,604
It's kind of funny, huh?

257
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,643
Hello. Hello.

258
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,882
How much?

259
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,443
That's academic. Look, no one
in America has heard of him.

260
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,170
I don't know why but-

261
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,924
Fine, okay, let's see.

262
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,764
Okay, bye.

263
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:44,929
You can write in straight lines.

264
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,088
You got it.

265
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,961
I may need to take off to
Italy in the next few weeks.

266
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,088
Oh.

267
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,528
So, you think you could,
uh, keep an eye on Maisie?

268
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,571
Okay, sure.

269
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,803
Go on, start again. You know you're only
supposed to do the first letter, right?

270
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,884
Your passport is in order, right?

271
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,367
Mine?
Uh-huh.

272
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,851
Uh-huh.

273
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,321
Good. Yeah.

274
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,607
Because this work should
only take a few days.

275
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:20,365
I thought after that maybe we
could go on a little cruise

276
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,171
in the Aeolian Islands,

277
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,164
you know, say something like that.

278
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,722
Yeah. I've never been to Italy.

279
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,006
Oh.

280
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,684
Or on a boat.

281
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,525
Right, great. Well, then, that's good.

282
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,803
We'll do that. We're
going on a boat? When?

283
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,009
Well, don't start packing just yet, okay?

284
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,320
It's all depending.

285
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,721
What's all this?

286
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,928
I got a flower delivery for Maisie Beale.

287
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,082
Maisie? Oh.

288
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,561
That's just- This is totally inappropriate.

289
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,847
Get them back to the delivery guy.

290
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,126
The guy already left.

291
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
Okay, I'll take it.

292
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,968
Ten minutes and then homework, okay?

293
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,690
Okay.

294
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,326
Sweetie?

295
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,765
What are these?

296
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,643
I don't know.

297
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,451
But, I mean, did you put them in there?

298
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,165
Maisie?

299
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,129
Mommy sent them.

300
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,170
Oh.

301
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,924
Well, we should put them
in some water.

302
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,606
Can't I just keep them in the closet?

303
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,370
Why?

304
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,761
'Cause daddy threw them out.

305
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,968
Oh.

306
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,327
He's allergic.

307
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,129
Really?

308
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,807
I'll tell you what.

309
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,521
Why don't we press a few, and
then you can keep them forever?

310
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,251
That'll be our little secret, okay?

311
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,644
Okay. Why don't you pick
some of your favorites?

312
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,245
Okay.

313
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,448
I like this one.

314
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,847
This one. Okay, here's our book.

315
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,531
And this one.

316
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,924
When we go back to Mommy's, can
we bring Starbrite's corral?

317
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,924
Um, sweetie, I'm not going with you.

318
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,964
Oh.

319
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,008
I'll be here when you get back.

320
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,845
Okay-

321
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,400
So, where do we put the flowers?
In the middle?

322
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,562
You put them in this side.

323
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,487
Gently.

324
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,360
You now, your daddy's sad
when you're not here, right?

325
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,407
So, um.

326
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,801
It's nice for him to have someone around

327
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,929
to... cheer him up.

328
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,049
And do the shopping and everything, too.

329
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,930
So, since we like each other,

330
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,368
we thought that maybe I could do that.

331
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,082
How does that sound?

332
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,081
Good.

333
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,163
Let's do another.
Okay.

334
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,442
I think the roses would be too big.

335
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,649
Yeah.
That one's nice.

336
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,767
Try that one.

337
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,451
Oh, my baby, I missed you so much.

338
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,124
I missed you, too.

339
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,804
Look.

340
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,281
Jesus.

341
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,328
Jesus, how did that happen?

342
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,448
I touched my arm on the stove

343
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,284
And I got burned and I cried.

344
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,124
I bet you did.

345
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,044
I bet that hurt.

346
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,125
How did it happen? Did daddy let
you cook by yourself or something?

347
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,601
Oh, god.
Okay.

348
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,887
The court says that I'm not
supposed to say anything,

349
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,169
But I would be, like, totally
negligent if I didn't tell you

350
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,890
That you really have to watch yourself

351
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,610
When you're alone with daddy, okay?

352
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,250
Margo was there.

353
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,368
Margo?
You mean,

354
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,010
You mean our Margo?

355
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,606
Margo who was at our house?
That Margo?

356
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,327
You have a nice room at daddy's?

357
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,528
Uh-Huh, I have a canopy bed.

358
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,008
Oh, that's nice.

359
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,163
Does Margo have a nice room?

360
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,767
It's tiny, and when you look out
the window, there's a wall.

361
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,447
Ooh, daddy must not like her very much
if he gives her a room like that.

362
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,045
He likes her.

363
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,885
Yeah?

364
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,645
Does he- Does he give her a kiss?

365
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,007
Anything like that?
Show her how much he likes her?

366
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,210
I don't know.
No?

367
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,691
No, huh?

368
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,925
Yes, yes, I'm sure. She just told me.
Hang on a second.

369
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,048
Hey, baby, go play in your
room for a little bit.

370
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,521
I'm going to finish this phone call, okay?

371
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,883
No, he's got her living with him.

372
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:57,009
What do you think I want? I want you
to take that asshole back to court

373
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,082
And get me sole custody.

374
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,811
Maisie?

375
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,723
Careful, Maisie.

376
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,450
Why would you be afraid of her?

377
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,927
I mean, fine, maybe she
looks a little funny,

378
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,844
But that's, like, really narrow minded.

379
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,888
I don't want you to grow up
to be one of those people

380
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,531
'Cause it's just not cool.

381
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,410
And you know what? She's the kind
of nanny you're supposed to have.

382
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,881
I mean, she's not some tramp
with a daddy fixation.

383
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,607
She smells funny.
She does not smell funny.

384
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,648
That's the way a nanny
is supposed to smell.

385
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,721
Come on.

386
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,609
Okay, let's go.

387
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,407
Come on, Maisie, let's go.

388
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,925
Get your stuff, sweetie.

389
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,089
Hey, turn around.

390
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,884
You're going to see him soon enough.
I will?

391
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,968
You're going to be a flower girl.
I am?

392
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,407
Yeah, there's nothing he won't do.

393
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,643
Here comes the fucking bride.

394
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,370
The collar is sticking up a little bit there.

395
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,647
Yeah, good.

396
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,209
Mrs. Beale, this is Principal
Fairchild- Tettenbaum.

397
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,204
This is my third message.
I would appreciate a call back.

398
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,805
Thank you.

399
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,884
Maisie, are you sure your mother knows

400
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,564
she's supposed to pick you up?

401
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,682
I don't know.
All right.

402
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,171
I'll figure something out.

403
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,804
Oh, Mais.

404
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,168
I thought that Maisie's mother was
supposed to be doing pick up today.

405
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,925
She is. If my husband hadn't checked
his messages at the airport,

406
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,800
we'd be on a plane. I'm
supposed to be on my honeymoon.

407
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,089
Hey, excuse me.
Is this, uh-

408
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:01,130
Susanna Nun. She sent
me to get her daughter.

409
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,690
Who are you?

410
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,570
Uh, I'm her, uh,

411
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,483
sort of like Maisie's stepfather.

412
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:11,645
You're what? Yeah, I'm married to Susanna.

413
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,367
Hey.

414
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,602
How-how are you, Maisie?
I'm Lincoln.

415
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,082
Do you remember me?
We met before a few weeks ago.

416
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,561
Remember that?
This is-

417
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:28,723
We don't just release children to
anyone walking into the office.

418
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,407
Um, no, of course, no.

419
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,768
So, I've got Maisie, and
I don't know what to do,

420
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
so can you please call me back?

421
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,004
I can't get hold of him.

422
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,048
Would you want to call Susanna?

423
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,202
Just if you want to make
sure I'm not some random-

424
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,203
I'm not going to call Susanna.

425
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,169
Why don't you call her?

426
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,050
Yeah. Yeah, sure. I can call.

427
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,640
Hey, it's me.

428
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,563
Yeah,no, it's good.

429
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,483
I'm outside the school here with Maisie,

430
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,166
and Margo is here.

431
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,129
I understand.

432
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,248
Yeah, well, she doesn't
really know who I am.

433
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,761
Yeah, all right.
Just one second.

434
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,446
Uh, it's Susanna.

435
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,806
Hello?

436
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,648
Yes.

437
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,449
I heard you.

438
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,168
Okay, so I'll just take Maisie-

439
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,651
He-hello?

440
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,087
Susanna?
Hello?

441
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,124
Okay.

442
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,051
Uh, I guess that's done.

443
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,724
Yeah, I guess.

444
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,086
I've got to go.

445
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,400
You need a cab?
Yeah.

446
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,807
I'll get you one.

447
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,769
Hey, taxi.

448
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,170
Hi.

449
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,569
Okay, Maisie, I'll see you in ten days.

450
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,802
I don't want you to go.

451
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,201
It'll be okay, okay?

452
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,362
I promise.

453
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,930
I have to go.

454
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,769
I don't want to go with him.

455
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,842
Oh, Maisie.

456
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,521
I really, really love you. Okay?

457
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,011
Okay.

458
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,082
See you in ten days, okay?

459
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,446
Bye, sweetie.

460
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,568
Have a nice honeymoon.

461
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,523
Bye, Maisie.

462
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,722
Please say bye.

463
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,043
JFK, please.

464
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,171
Yeah, we should probably wait.

465
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,964
She's lost it.

466
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,566
No, we need some more.

467
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:44,120
Oh, I'll be back.
Baby just came home.

468
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,728
I have to kiss you.

469
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,648
Mommy?
Yeah?

470
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,121
Did you really get married?

471
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,682
Uh-huh. But I still love you the best.

472
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,162
And I'm still your mommy, right?

473
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,483
And, you know, he's just-he's
just like a friend.

474
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,483
You don't have to call
him Daddy or anything.

475
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,088
Just like-just like you don't
call Margo mommy, right?

476
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,925
You can just call him Lincoln.

477
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,480
Did you have a flower girl?

478
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:27,121
Oh, you know what?
If we did, it would've been you.

479
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,487
But we kept it really low key,

480
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,844
and, um, it was just like with a
Justice of the Peace kind of thing.

481
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,126
We didn't even have a cake.

482
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,441
No cake?
No cake.

483
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,488
Sad but true.

484
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,086
Here, want to see something?

485
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,527
You want to see what he gave me?
Look at this.

486
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,807
Look at that.
It's tiny.

487
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,370
It is tiny, isn't it?

488
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,761
Tiny, tiny, little one.

489
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,561
Hey.

490
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,409
Hey.
Sorry.

491
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,369
It's okay.
Come on in.

492
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,727
I- I got to go to work actually.

493
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,484
Okay.

494
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,642
It was nice seeing you again, Maisie.

495
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,524
Say goodbye to Lincoln.

496
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,171
Bye.
Bye.

497
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,447
How tall he is.
He's so tall.

498
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,611
Doe she always work at night?
Yeah.

499
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,160
He's pretty much just a bartender,
but you know, whatever.

500
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,971
It's good, so when I'm
working, he can watch you.

501
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,883
It's going to be good.

502
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,442
Can I tell you a secret?

503
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,603
I married him for you.

504
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,562
I married him for you.

505
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,051
"Sleep tight
On the night train"

506
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,690
"No pain"

507
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,001
"I don't remember"

508
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,447
"Oh a couple
Of years"

509
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,329
"Did some
Good for you"

510
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,129
"No your eyes"

511
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,804
Hey, it's too thin.

512
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,450
I want to do a couple more,

513
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,722
and then I want to hear it doubled, okay?

514
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,723
You go it.

515
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,605
What are you making?

516
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,889
Is it a palace?
It's a castle.

517
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,163
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, of course.

518
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,686
It's beautiful.

519
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,524
You're really good.

520
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,366
I don't know how to make
one of those... bridges.

521
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,568
Like a drawbridge?

522
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,490
Well, just, um,

523
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,602
if you make the doorway here

524
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:22,127
and then like the bridge going
down and then some chains.

525
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,601
That's it.
With a moat.

526
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,169
I can't do it.

527
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,481
You do it.

528
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,483
But it's your drawing.

529
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,251
Really? Okay.

530
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,210
Maybe you can draw
some animals in the moat,

531
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,487
some dangerous animals so
people can't swim across.

532
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,408
Crocodiles and some polar bears

533
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,482
and stuff that will eat you.

534
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,528
Okay.

535
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,328
I haven't used a crayon in a
really, really long time.

536
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,085
When I was a kid, I read
this story about a family,

537
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,322
and their car broke down in the desert.

538
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,563
And do-do you know how
they survived? How?

539
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,291
They ate crayons and paste.

540
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,846
Ew. It sounded pretty good to me.

541
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,891
I used to sneak paste to eat
when I was a kid. You did?

542
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,486
"I don't remember"

543
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,642
"Ooh a couple"

544
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,404
The stuff we had was really good.

545
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,524
Delicious. You should try it.
No.

546
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,126
No?
Hey.

547
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,568
You want to come in the
booth with me while I sing?

548
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,007
Okay.
Come on.

549
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,846
Hey. You didn't say goodbye.

550
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,088
Yes, I did.
No, you didn't.

551
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,963
I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you so much.

552
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,520
Okay.
All right.

553
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,446
I'll see you in ten days, okay?
Bye, baby.

554
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,131
You cannot tell him, so that
you really can't show him.

555
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:53,329
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

556
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,004
Who's that?

557
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,048
Hey. What are you still doing here?

558
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:04,245
Um, ok- Le-let's go.
Let's go and check.

559
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,121
No, no, he didn't forget.
He knows it's his pick up day.

560
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,362
Honeymoon my ass.
He's messing with me.

561
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,841
Look, it's a violation of the court order,

562
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,844
and he agreed to those dates before he left.

563
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:22,322
You got to be kidding me.

564
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,006
Great, okay.

565
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,761
So, he says it's a violation
of the court order

566
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,127
for them to not let us pick her up.

567
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,683
But if they don't pick her up,
it's not a violation, okay?

568
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,609
He knows it's his pick up day.

569
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,206
Maybe-
What, what, what?

570
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,806
We could go back to the court again.
No, no.

571
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,201
I'm not subjecting myself to that bullshit.

572
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,930
Where are my cigarettes?

573
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,809
Jesus.

574
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:53,291
A witch hunt, that's what it is.

575
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,806
Hey, are you hungry?

576
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,605
Do you get to make all
the food for everyone?

577
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,569
Uh, no.

578
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,325
I'm just-I'm just a bartender.

579
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,522
Do you get lots of money?

580
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,807
Well, I get tips.

581
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,963
But not lots of money.
I wouldn't say that, no.

582
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:27,044
Do you think it's important
to make lots of money?

583
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,043
Uh-huh.
How come?

584
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,121
So you can be rich.
Oh, of course, so you can be rich.

585
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,885
What if you like doing something
where you don't make lots of money?

586
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,526
Like what?
Like being a teacher.

587
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,648
Or maybe you want to be a nurse.

588
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,963
Or a fireman.
Or a bartender.

589
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,247
Yeah, or a bartender.

590
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,165
For now.

591
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,890
Here we go.

592
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,684
Bon appetit.

593
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,688
I- I thought you said you liked eggs.

594
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,527
I don't want to ruin it.

595
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,441
Okay, see you later.

596
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,682
You're supposed to walk me in.

597
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,728
Are you sure
we don't say bye here?

598
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,690
Really?

599
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,127
Okay.

600
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,124
Maisie has something she'd
like to share with the class.

601
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,328
This is my new stepfather.

602
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,129
Hi.

603
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,969
My father married my nanny,

604
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,771
so court made my mommy get married, too.

605
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,165
Tyler.
I've two stepfathers.

606
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,481
But one is almost dead.

607
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,490
"And most castles had 50
rooms and were in England.

608
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:51,848
"If someone hurt your
animal or tried to be rich,

609
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,845
"they would be killed
and put in jail.

610
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,491
"A lot of people in jail
hurt their-selves

611
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,042
"so that they could go to
the hospital and have food.

612
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,842
"They ate stale bread, and then
gave the bread to the homeless.

613
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,845
The end. Life in a Castle
by Maisie Elizabeth Beale."

614
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,082
Wow.

615
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,447
That's amazing.

616
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,724
What am I, invisible?

617
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,804
You know, you don't get a bonus for
making her fall in love with you.

618
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,481
Hey, baby, why don't you go to
your room for a little while

619
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,801
so Lincoln and I can talk, okay?

620
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,563
Dude, how am I supposed to go away
on to work and leave her with you

621
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,847
when you're full of shit?

622
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,843
What are you talking about?
And when did this tour come?

623
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,365
You deliberately undermine me.

624
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,330
Why does everything have
to be such a nightmare?

625
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,840
You know, I've turned
into this like petty-

626
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,844
I don't recognize myself anymore.

627
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,084
You know, baby, all I wanted was for
him to make things easier for us.

628
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:34,202
Your story is very cool.

629
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,364
Thank you.

630
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:40,205
Hey.

631
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,009
What are you thinking about?

632
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,367
Nothing.

633
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,044
No?

634
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,129
You want to come to
work with me tomorrow?

635
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,283
Maybe you could help me pick
out my costumes for the tour.

636
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,408
Would you like that?

637
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,446
Your dad's an asshole.
He really is.

638
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:23,048
First he disappears, and then
he shows up out of nowhere.

639
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:25,566
I don't know how to deal with this.

640
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,762
I really don't.

641
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,128
Baby, I got to lie down.

642
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,129
Lincoln, Beale's downstairs.

643
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,323
Hey.

644
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,765
Come here.

645
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,923
Whoa. You missed me? Uh-huh.

646
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,520
Yeah, we were wondering when we
were going to see you again.

647
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,807
You're the husband?
Yeah.

648
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:06,121
It's-it's the new husband.

649
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,481
My name is Lincoln. It's Beale.
Pleased to meet you.

650
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,484
Nice to meet you.

651
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:13,927
I'd give you a couple of pointers
but I doubt that the, uh,

652
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,049
Jacoby and tragedy
that was our relationship

653
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:20,169
would apply to the farce that
you two guys are playing out.

654
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,850
Okay. Okay.

655
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:23,809
Anyway, good luck.
Yeah.

656
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,365
Bye, Maisie.
Whoa.

657
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,205
Bye.

658
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:29,850
Thank you.

659
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,681
Tall and young. Ha.

660
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,162
It's funny. He's so not her type.

661
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,727
Hilarious.

662
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,363
How's your mom?

663
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,771
Fine.

664
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,171
Happy?

665
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,480
Uh-huh.

666
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,243
A word that sounds like owl?

667
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,970
Tyler.
Clown.

668
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,168
Clown. Excellent.
Victor.

669
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,368
Town.
Town.

670
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,090
Maisie.
Sound.

671
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,241
Sound. Good.

672
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,090
Which is your favorite?

673
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,084
I like the blue one.

674
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,606
It's getting late, Mais.
We should go.

675
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,647
Are we still going on a boat with Daddy?

676
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,609
What boat, sweetie?

677
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,445
In Italy, like he said.

678
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,966
Um, I don't know.
Maybe.

679
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,168
Are you and Daddy still married?

680
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,844
Of course.

681
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,207
It's not like pretend?

682
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,248
No. Why would you ask that?

683
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,005
I don't know.

684
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,285
Oh, Mais.

685
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,004
Come on, Beale,

686
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,849
you didn't even tell us you were leaving.

687
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,729
First, we were going to be coming with you,

688
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,531
and then it was only going
to be for a few days.

689
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,887
When are you coming back?

690
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,122
What do you mean you don't know?

691
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,611
Hold on.

692
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,249
What are you doing up?

693
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,527
Does your throat still hurt?

694
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,731
It's not time for your medicine, yet.

695
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,280
I'm talking to your father in London.

696
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,887
Can I talk to him?

697
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,689
Here's Maisie.

698
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,245
Daddy?

699
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,130
I don't feel good.

700
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,044
No.

701
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:27,288
I miss you, too.

702
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,330
It's me.

703
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,088
I don't know.
I told you.

704
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:36,242
They were supposed to pick
her up three days ago.

705
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:39,847
It would just be nice to know
when anything is going to happen

706
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,729
about anything.

707
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:43,882
Okay-

708
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,485
No.

709
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:47,608
I should just go.

710
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,126
Right.
Bye.

711
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,088
I'll be right back.

712
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:01,921
You're three days late. It's 10:00
at night, and she's not well.

713
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,321
It's okay.
We'll take a taxi.

714
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,971
It's not okay. She's got
a temperature of 101.

715
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,644
It's-

716
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,529
Hey.

717
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:15,650
Oh. You're not feeling well, are you?

718
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,643
I have the bug.

719
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:19,484
Oh, the bug.

720
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,130
That sounds bad.

721
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,010
Why didn't you come?
I'm sorry.

722
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,731
There was this whole mix up and-

723
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,770
Well, kind like three mix ups actually.

724
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,764
I have to take my medicine in an hour.

725
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,002
Okay.
Okay.

726
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,925
So, what do you want me to do?

727
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,525
Susanna is going to kill me.

728
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,086
Come back in a day or two.
A day or-

729
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,288
I can't come back tonight without her.

730
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,169
Susanna is going on tour this weekend.

731
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:51,245
Lincoln, she's a child.
She's not well.

732
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,809
I'll see you in a couple of days.

733
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,484
Okay?

734
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,210
Get some rest, so you feel better, okay?

735
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,921
Goodnight.

736
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,730
That one.

737
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,245
Good choice.

738
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,043
Hey.
Mommy.

739
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,045
No, we need some of-

740
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,889
Baby, let me show you this bus.

741
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,485
It's good, huh?

742
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,881
You got ice-cream.
You got chocolate.

743
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,325
You want one of these?

744
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,011
Hang on tight. You got it?
I got it.

745
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:17,605
Cool.

746
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,364
I- I can't talk right now.

747
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,249
Good, here we go.

748
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:24,329
Here we go, baby.

749
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,769
I can't see anything.

750
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,525
One, two, three, cheese.

751
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,881
Hey, baby, look, there's Lincoln.

752
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,209
Come on, let's go.

753
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,761
It sucks that we don't
have more time together.

754
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,241
But you know I love you
more than anything, right?

755
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,810
Okay?

756
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:02,967
I do.

757
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,081
Okay, go.

758
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,840
Watch out.

759
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,081
Okay.

760
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,690
Okay, bye.

761
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,643
...hotel room.

762
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,087
She's in the bathroom for like 15 minutes.

763
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,003
I'm watching television...

764
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:28,323
and she comes out
of the bathroom buck naked.

765
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:30,084
I'm like, okay, fine...

766
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,491
I push her up against the glass-

767
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,846
Your order, sir.

768
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,931
Do you want to come sit over
here instead, by the cherries?

769
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,769
It's more fun over there.

770
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,085
Is it okay if she sits here?

771
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,640
It's fine.

772
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,489
Check this out.

773
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,005
Hello?

774
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,685
Ooh!

775
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,287
I can't hear you!

776
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:42,970
It's like you're a monkey.

777
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,481
Oh.

778
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,400
You got an eye on that?

779
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,845
Don't.
I that it?

780
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,968
Again?

781
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,361
Yeah, I'll try.
I'll call you back.

782
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,762
Hey, Maisie?
Come here a minute.

783
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,047
They called from-from work,

784
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,929
and someone is sick today,

785
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,765
so I'm going to have to
go in and work probably.

786
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,684
I could go with you again.

787
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,091
No.

788
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:30,128
No, we-
We can't do that.

789
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,441
It's not a good idea.

790
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,045
Don't bite your nails.

791
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,083
You ate glue.
Yeah.

792
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,282
All right, wise guy, come on, let's go.

793
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,203
I'm not a guy. I'm a girl.

794
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,282
Yeah, come on, wise girl.

795
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,604
What if she's not here?

796
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,524
I don't know.

797
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,569
Maybe Caroline can come.

798
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,369
No, Caroline's got a boyfriend.

799
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,331
Come on.

800
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:02,206
Can I go to work with you then?
No, you can't.

801
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,047
Oh, we'll-we'll figure something out.

802
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,683
I know it's late over there, Beale.

803
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,808
I've been stuck in this hallway for an hour.

804
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,451
Just tell the guy at the door
to come up here and let me in.

805
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:19,084
Hi.

806
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,884
What are you doing here?

807
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,486
Well, I-I know it hasn't been ten days, yet.

808
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:28,202
But I- He has to go to work.

809
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:32,968
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh, you know,
things have been a little rough

810
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,451
with her mother gone and-and all.

811
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,409
Right.

812
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,847
You know, I was just thinking
like we're both in-

813
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,968
You thought what?

814
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,405
That I feel sorry for you?

815
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,801
That I've got nothing else to do?

816
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:48,043
That I'm just that sort of person?

817
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,441
Well, I'm not, so you deal with it.

818
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:51,851
It's your problem, not mine.

819
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,922
I didn't-I didn't say that.

820
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,729
I am locked out of my own apartment

821
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,361
because my husband didn't
bother putting me on the lease.

822
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,681
Like I don't exist.

823
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,451
I have done everything I was supposed to.

824
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:19,763
He can't use people like this.

825
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,684
I- I didn't realize that-

826
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:25,286
I'm really sorry.

827
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,048
Just go.

828
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:38,168
Please.
Yeah.

829
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,969
Come on, Maisie.

830
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,526
I'm sorry.

831
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,805
You know I didn't mean you, don't you?

832
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,206
Thank you.

833
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,368
None of this is your fault.

834
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,410
I'll see you later, Maisie.

835
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:23,767
It's not Lincoln's fault, either.

836
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,366
He's just mixed up, too.

837
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,723
You really like him, don't you?

838
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,609
I love him.

839
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:34,490
I'm sorry I got mad at him.

840
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,927
He must think I'm awful.

841
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,686
Mommy gets mad at him all the time.

842
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,010
There he is.

843
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,565
Hey, Maisie.

844
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,523
Hey.
Hi.

845
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,489
I did the icing but it's from her

846
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,767
'cause she's sorry she got mad at you.

847
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:13,361
Oh.
A cake.

848
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,647
I told her that you like chocolate.

849
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,802
I do like chocolate.

850
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,491
Thank you.
Thank you both.

851
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,445
Uh, you guys hungry?

852
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,568
Yeah? I know someone who works here

853
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:30,364
so I might be able to get you a table.

854
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,363
You work here.

855
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,681
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I do work here.

856
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,240
Uh, come on.

857
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,084
You know what some people eat here?

858
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,000
What? Raw hamburger
with raw eggs on it.

859
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,809
Ew.

860
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,484
These are from Lincoln.

861
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:54,083
Would you eat a raw hamburger
with a raw egg on it?

862
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,528
Never.
Would you?

863
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:01,730
Glasgow has got such
a vibe and a lot of culture.

864
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,411
It's so funny 'cause, like, to me

865
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,926
you don't have a very thick Scottish accent

866
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,367
when you say Glasgow, Glasgow.
That's nice.

867
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:13,081
Yeah, it is, it is.

868
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:18,803
Yeah, I always wonder if I'll be now.

869
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,122
Thank you for the cake and tonight.

870
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,531
Yeah.

871
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:49,489
Okay.

872
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,891
Goodnight.

873
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,249
Morning.
Morning.

874
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,289
How did you sleep?
Good.

875
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:13,603
What do you want for breakfast?

876
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:15,648
Mm, I don't know.

877
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,609
Pancakes.

878
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,365
Okay.
Pancakes it is.

879
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:42,645
Lincoln.

880
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,804
Sorry I'm late.

881
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,247
The wolf is scaring her grandma.

882
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,527
Oh, bummer.

883
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:55,887
She's chasing the wolf there.

884
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,601
Okay, higher.
Higher.

885
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:12,521
Don't get too close.
There are so many.

886
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,364
This is really cool.

887
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:16,841
I can't believe
I haven't been here before.

888
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:19,002
Look, see, there's a baby turtle.

889
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:20,844
Whoa.

890
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,524
Look at that guy.
He's checking you out.

891
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,086
So many of them.

892
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:26,844
This is great.

893
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,968
Yeah, I like it here.

894
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:30,929
You know what?
What.

895
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,288
You could buy turtles in the street.

896
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,886
They keep them in buckets,
and they're only $1.

897
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,083
Really? Wow. I was
bitten by a turtle once.

898
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,806
Were you really?
Yeah, yeah.

899
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,167
It even left a scar if you-

900
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,004
Big?

901
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:50,802
It could've left a scar.

902
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,486
It's that bad. It could've left a scar.
Right, yeah.

903
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,086
So, is it quite traumatic for you
being here with the turtles?

904
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:58,601
This is kind like therapy for me.
Oh, it is? Okay.

905
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:00,330
Meeting the beast again.

906
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:05,167
That's the last one
until after dinner, okay?

907
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,811
Daddy.

908
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,048
We'll do this. Daddy!

909
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:12,361
Hey, my favorite girl.

910
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,283
Hey, you got heavy.

911
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,291
What a surprise.
Yeah, I had a change of schedule.

912
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:22,810
I can smell candy.

913
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,321
We went to go see a puppet show.
Did you now?

914
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:27,562
Red Riding Hood.
Oh, that's scary.

915
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,244
I was just about to make some dinner.

916
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,971
Ah, not for me, thanks.
I ate on the plane.

917
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,883
Yuck.

918
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,291
I got a couple of calls to make,

919
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,249
but I'll join you guys later.

920
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,129
Come on, Maisie, we should get washed up.

921
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,210
Oh, hey, sweetie.

922
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,004
Where is Margo?

923
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,648
Pff.

924
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,406
Maybe she went for a long walk.

925
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:42,404
Let's go get breakfast.

926
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,003
I, uh.

927
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:03,242
I don't need to tell you
things are a bit of a mess

928
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,687
since your mom ran off.

929
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,127
She's on a big tour.

930
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,441
Not so big from what I hear.

931
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,605
But, uh, be that as it may,

932
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:17,445
Um, I may have to go back to England.

933
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,967
Um, couple of, you know,
business opportunities,

934
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,328
and your grandmother is
not getting any younger.

935
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,607
You... you understand?

936
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:30,287
Can I come? We can-we
can get the coins.

937
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:32,601
Coins?
What coins?

938
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:36,002
Like your daddy found in the
ground when you were little.

939
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,568
You remember me telling you that?

940
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,325
Maybe we can find some more.

941
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,210
Would you like that?
Yeah? Just the two of us?

942
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,567
You and your old man
digging for coins?

943
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,325
I could do with a few.

944
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,282
Why not? Your mother would have a fit.

945
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,846
But I don't think I'd have a
problem squaring it with the judge

946
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:59,922
after she ditched with that bartender.

947
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,129
Sure I could settle with Margo
without any legal nonsense.

948
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:06,970
Why not?

949
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,083
Why not?
Why not?

950
01:09:10,160 --> 01:09:12,162
Will I get back in time?

951
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,568
For what?
To go to Mommy's.

952
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,687
This wouldn't be a day
excursion, you know that.

953
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,406
This would be like a permanent thing.

954
01:09:22,480 --> 01:09:25,450
All the time?
All the time.

955
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,091
Maybe Mommy would like
to live there, too.

956
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,889
No, there's no Mommy in England.

957
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,406
You can't-

958
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:37,887
There's a whole ocean.

959
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:42,964
It's-

960
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,846
You know, England is, um-

961
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,083
England is pretty cold, actually.

962
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,128
It rains a lot.

963
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,202
And, um.

964
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:05,806
And we need to have to rethink, you know.

965
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,967
And you're on the fence, I can see that.

966
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,566
I think you'd be happier here.

967
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:19,728
All the same.

968
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,241
Um, the good news

969
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:28,688
is that when I visit America for work,

970
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,728
I can see you, too.

971
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,730
Does your nose still make that
squeaky noise when you press it?

972
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,320
Okay. You would have laughed at
that when you were four years old.

973
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,402
Don't deny it.

974
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,288
Take care, Mr. Beale.
Sure.

975
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,960
Bye.

976
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,407
Okay, bye.

977
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,448
Have a safe trip now.

978
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:27,330
Quinn, 8B.

979
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,721
Volgo, 11E.

980
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:32,963
Remmy, 9C.

981
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,566
Laporte,
penthouse.

982
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:39,804
Remmy, 9C.

983
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,043
1A. Laporte, penthouse.

984
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,487
I thought your father was a way.

985
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:49,724
Well, he was here when we
came from the puppets.

986
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,007
Well, I can't really watch you now.

987
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,884
I got to be in Chinatown in half an hour,

988
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,724
and I'm sort of late already.

989
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,768
Is it still Margo's week?

990
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,525
She and daddy had a fight, and
this morning she was gone.

991
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:02,090
Gone?

992
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,208
Where did she go?
I don't know.

993
01:12:04,280 --> 01:12:05,930
But Daddy's going to England,

994
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,411
and he said that I could go with him

995
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,528
and then he said that I couldn't.

996
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:12,888
And then we came in a
taxi and he left me here.

997
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,601
Well, that's a lot.

998
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,967
Okay, I'll-
Why don't-

999
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,044
I'll call Margo.
See if I can find her.

1000
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:25,850
It'll be okay.

1001
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,804
Oh, there she is.

1002
01:12:45,680 --> 01:12:47,045
Hey.
Hey.

1003
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,963
Thanks.

1004
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,450
Thanks for coming.

1005
01:12:52,520 --> 01:12:54,727
Yeah, of course I came.

1006
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:07,130
What if they don't have a turtle?

1007
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,487
I'm sure we'll find one somewhere.

1008
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,370
Okay, well, actually
I have to go this way.

1009
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:15,091
But I'll see your turtle
when I get home, okay?

1010
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,323
Thanks for your help.
Okay, well, just call me.

1011
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,129
Mommy!

1012
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,202
Oh, my God, baby.

1013
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,282
I'm so happy to see you.

1014
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,488
We're going to get a turtle.

1015
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,847
A turtle?
A turtle?

1016
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,127
So, what are you two
doing with my daughter?

1017
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,050
What are you talking about?
Looking after her while you're on tour.

1018
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:36,521
What are you, like a stalker?

1019
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,881
What are you going to stiff me next, huh?

1020
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,406
So, what are you two doing together, huh?

1021
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,329
What am I doing?
What are you doing?

1022
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,890
What are you doing?

1023
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,162
I'm back for half a day.
Oh, yeah?

1024
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:49,447
Cars are coming.
Hey, hey, hey!

1025
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:51,727
Do you mind?
I have a kid here.

1026
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:53,768
What the fuck?
What are you doing?

1027
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:55,803
Really, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1028
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,564
I'm taking my daughter, that's what.

1029
01:13:57,640 --> 01:13:59,449
Get out of my face.

1030
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,366
I'll love to get out of your face.

1031
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,602
You don't deserve her.

1032
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,367
I'm done.

1033
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,926
Let's go get the turtle.
Let's go get it.

1034
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,602
Let's go get the turtle.

1035
01:14:25,960 --> 01:14:27,485
Do you like it?

1036
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,090
It's what you wanted, right?
Uh-huh.

1037
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,571
Yeah.

1038
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:42,483
What do you want to do?

1039
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,324
Hungry or anything?

1040
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,841
You want something to eat?
No, thanks.

1041
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,329
You know, I didn't even know
we were stopping in New York.

1042
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:58,244
Okay. Okay?

1043
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,290
Yeah?

1044
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:03,488
Okay.

1045
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,047
This turtle is pretty cool, you know.

1046
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,808
Want to come to our house?

1047
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,641
Want to come to our house, turtle?

1048
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,201
No, I don't-I don't care what you tell him.

1049
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,760
Just say that I have
laryngitis or something

1050
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,323
or mercury poisoning, all right?

1051
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,482
Just get me out of it.

1052
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:36,483
No, I'm not leaving her.

1053
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,729
Goddammit, come on.

1054
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:41,450
What am I supposed to do?

1055
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:44,330
I can't go back on the road right now.

1056
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,370
I can't.
No, I'm not going to.

1057
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:51,405
Jesus, what do you expect me to do?

1058
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,324
Hey, baby.

1059
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,200
Honey, wake up. Okay, wake up.
We got to go.

1060
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:04,123
It really sucks but we got to go.
Come on.

1061
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,810
Okay, baby.

1062
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,730
I am so sorry but I have- I got to go.

1063
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,484
I just can't miss another show right now

1064
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,562
because I'll have a massive loss

1065
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:20,564
and I just can't handle that right now.

1066
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,002
Okay? But you know
what I'm going to do?

1067
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:26,162
I'm going to have you full
now for a couple of shows

1068
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:28,129
and then we can hang out for a while

1069
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,329
and then maybe we could
sing a duet together.

1070
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,570
Is that too phony?

1071
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:39,440
Okay, uh, you can hang out here with
Lincoln until he's finished work

1072
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:42,091
and then he's going
to take you home, okay?

1073
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:44,806
I love you so much.

1074
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,120
I got to go, baby.

1075
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,687
Maisie.

1076
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,206
I'm going to wait till you go inside, okay?

1077
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:54,123
It's all right.

1078
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:26,527
Hey, hon.
Remember me?

1079
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,763
Where's Lincoln?
He's not on tonight.

1080
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:31,729
Who are you with?

1081
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:34,280
My mom put me here so that
I could stay with him.

1082
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,449
Well, let me talk to your mom.
She left.

1083
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,330
Hi, still serving?
Absolutely.

1084
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,802
Um... stay right here, okay?

1085
01:17:43,880 --> 01:17:45,769
I'll be right back.

1086
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,410
Right this way.

1087
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:23,046
I'll keep making calls and see if I can find him.

1088
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,805
Thanks for doing this. No problem.
See you tomorrow.

1089
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,531
What are you doing up?

1090
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,125
Hey, kid.

1091
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:46,807
Where's Margo?
I want to go home.

1092
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:51,209
Where's Margo? You're going to
stay here tonight, remember?

1093
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:53,442
It's going to be fine.
Let's go back to bed.

1094
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,161
I want to go home. I want to go home.
Come here.

1095
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,931
Please, I want to go home.

1096
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,490
It's okay.

1097
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:05,961
It's going to be fine.

1098
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,969
Just a couple of things,
okay, sweetie? Okay.

1099
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,168
What about my turtle?

1100
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,722
We'll get the turtle.

1101
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,369
And you know what?

1102
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:33,087
What? My cousin told me where the key is.

1103
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:35,328
Guess where it is? Where?

1104
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,847
It's under the mat on the back door.

1105
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,649
You're going to be okay with your bag?

1106
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:42,085
Uh-huh.

1107
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:00,690
Oh, God.

1108
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,411
God, don't do this.

1109
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,204
There's an upstairs.

1110
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,009
Yeah, you want to go see?

1111
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:06,365
It's cold.

1112
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:07,805
Feels good.

1113
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,570
Look.

1114
01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:29,324
What if someone buys the house?
Where would we go?

1115
01:23:29,440 --> 01:23:31,442
It doesn't happen that fast.

1116
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,124
What if we had to go somewhere else?

1117
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,884
How would people know where we are?

1118
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,082
We tell them.
What if we couldn't find them?

1119
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,811
We'd find them and we'd tell hem.

1120
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,327
Anyway, I told them where we were
so they wouldn't be worried.

1121
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:45,846
Dinner's ready.

1122
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,441
What do you think this should be?

1123
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,921
Probably a window.
A window?

1124
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:02,324
Hey, Maisie.
Come on.

1125
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:04,209
Okay, let's go to the beach.

1126
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:09,446
Can you hear the ocean? Shh.

1127
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,329
Yes.
You can?

1128
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:13,885
Wow.

1129
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,968
Okay. Two pails.

1130
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,405
Two pails?

1131
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,050
Let's trade.

1132
01:24:22,080 --> 01:24:23,241
There you go.

1133
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,169
Lincoln!

1134
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,170
Lincoln!

1135
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:37,287
Hey.

1136
01:24:39,080 --> 01:24:40,525
Hey.

1137
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:44,164
How are you?

1138
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,004
Want to see my room?

1139
01:24:46,080 --> 01:24:48,651
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to see your room.

1140
01:24:48,720 --> 01:24:50,848
Of course.
Of course.

1141
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,610
I'd love to see your room. Hey.

1142
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:56,243
Hey.

1143
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,930
I'm sorry.

1144
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,606
It's not working again.

1145
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:07,447
It's not working again.

1146
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:22,363
I got it.

1147
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:24,807
There's a place in the back
where we can get worms.

1148
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:27,724
And we can go on the boat
next door whenever we want.

1149
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,962
Oh,wow.
Perfect.

1150
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:33,527
We can go tomorrow if you want to.
Lincoln just got here.

1151
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,962
How long are you staying? Well,
definitely long enough to go on the boat.

1152
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,646
It's beautiful here.

1153
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:45,483
Uh, I brought you something from
the city I thought you might like.

1154
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,449
Wait, I'll show you something.

1155
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,161
There's a picture that I
thought might be interesting.

1156
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,290
Look at that.
Look.

1157
01:25:58,360 --> 01:25:59,930
You know why?
Why?

1158
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,048
I was thinking we might want this guy.

1159
01:26:02,120 --> 01:26:04,088
We can put him in our moat.

1160
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:06,322
In our moat, that was what
I was thinking. Perfect.

1161
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,283
You guys have a moat? Of course.

1162
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,362
Okay-

1163
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,000
What's that?
Look at that.

1164
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,929
Do you want to pick it up?
Look at that, Maisie.

1165
01:26:26,040 --> 01:26:29,328
Gently, gently. It's holding onto the rock.

1166
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,402
Look, he's moving.

1167
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,687
He's moving.

1168
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,047
He's waving at you.

1169
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,606
You're going to hold my hand?
Yeah.

1170
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:42,603
Okay. Don't stand on him.

1171
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:44,523
Could we go on the boat tomorrow?

1172
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,762
Why don't you ask the
fishermen when they get back?

1173
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:49,923
Hold on. Hold on.

1174
01:26:58,160 --> 01:27:01,960
He said we could go tomorrow!

1175
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,928
One, two three, four, five, six, seven.

1176
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,446
I want to buy it.

1177
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,648
You already have it.

1178
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:13,609
I want to buy a hotel.
Can I have two?

1179
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:15,364
Yeah.

1180
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,363
Fifty?

1181
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:20,569
Are you kidding me?
You can't even buy a hostel.

1182
01:27:20,640 --> 01:27:22,722
You got to do better than that.
Give me a little more.

1183
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,047
Two hotels you got to pay.
Give me, uh-

1184
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,444
Oh, how generous of you. You don't
even get a sleeping bag for that.

1185
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,206
We weren't allowed to play
Monopoly when I was a kid.

1186
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:36,688
What did you play instead? This
Swiss doctor made some games.

1187
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,206
They're supposed to instill
cooperation and pacifism.

1188
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,767
That's probably why you're losing.
Yeah. Ha, ha, ha.

1189
01:27:44,680 --> 01:27:46,444
In my house, it was
every man for himself.

1190
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:48,284
Oh, thanks for the warning.

1191
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:51,768
What's funny?
You are.

1192
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:54,281
Yeah, you are. You are so funny.
You are so funny.

1193
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:56,522
Thank you.
Okay.

1194
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:58,762
No.
Go to jail.

1195
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,689
Oh, come on.
I need some luck now.

1196
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:08,162
It's not fair.

1197
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,847
Surprise.

1198
01:28:45,680 --> 01:28:47,808
Ah, oh.

1199
01:28:47,880 --> 01:28:51,965
Oh, my little beach bunny.

1200
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,965
Hey, guess what? I'm playing
Virginia Beach tomorrow night.

1201
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:58,281
I found this really nice girl with a dog

1202
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:00,328
who can watch you during the show.

1203
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,802
And then after that we go to
North Carolina and Tennessee.

1204
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:07,129
Why kind of a dog? I don't know.

1205
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:09,407
But, um, it's kind of a long drive,

1206
01:29:09,480 --> 01:29:12,086
so if you want to say goodbye to
these guys, you'd better hurry up.

1207
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:14,851
Okay, go ahead.
Go on.

1208
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,043
Or you can just come back to
the bus and we can take off

1209
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:22,361
and you can open all the presents I got you.

1210
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:26,084
You want to do that?

1211
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:29,926
I want to meet the dog
but maybe the day after.

1212
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,970
Well, baby, the day after I'm
playing Raleigh, so I got to go.

1213
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,601
Okay, come on. Come on, let's go, babe.
Come on, come on.

1214
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:39,924
What's up? What's the matter?
Come on.

1215
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,162
We're supposed to go on a boat tomorrow.

1216
01:29:42,240 --> 01:29:44,720
Baby, we can go on a boat any day, okay?
It's not a big deal.

1217
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,609
We got to go.
Come on, let's go.

1218
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:49,047
Come on.
Come on.

1219
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,805
Maisie, come on.

1220
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,201
Don't you want to come?

1221
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:08,002
Fine.

1222
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,970
Why did I fucking bother?

1223
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,771
God, what is if? You just decided
you don't like me anymore?

1224
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,524
Is that it?

1225
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,683
What, are you scared of me?

1226
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:34,764
Oh, shit.

1227
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:43,130
I'm sorry, baby.
I'm so sorry.

1228
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:46,603
I don't want you to be scared.

1229
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,725
I'm an idiot, you know.

1230
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,491
I'm, um-

1231
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:55,803
Hey, Maisie, Maisie, baby, you know what?

1232
01:30:55,880 --> 01:30:58,486
I really love you.

1233
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:01,086
I really do.

1234
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:04,562
Before you where born, I-I didn't
know it was possible to love somebody

1235
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,210
as much as I love you.

1236
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:09,284
You're just like my, my little baby.

1237
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,369
Can I tell you something?

1238
01:31:15,120 --> 01:31:17,964
A long time ago I was just like you.

1239
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:23,329
I was just like you.

1240
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,647
You want to go on a boat tomorrow?

1241
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,130
You want... to stay with them for a while?

1242
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,527
You know who your mother is, right?

1243
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,365
You.

1244
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:21,644
Let's go open your presents.

1245
01:32:23,240 --> 01:32:24,685
Come on.

1246
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,207
All right, you got to tell
me how big you want it.

1247
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:18,765
That's good.

1248
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:20,490
That's good?
That's good.

1249
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,085
Do you know where the filters are?

1250
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,521
Um, on the table.

1251
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,489
Look at that little baby pancake.

1252
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,324
That's tiny.
I want a big pancake.

1253
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,640
Shall we do another one?

1254
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:31,762
You ready?
I want a big one.

1255
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,009
You want a big one? This one's very big.
Okay, good.

1256
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:34,048
Come on, hurry up.
