00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,200
Newspaper.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,320
Newspaper.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,520
Newspaper, today's news.

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,320
Newspaper.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,591
Newspaper.

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,040
Hi Joe.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,280
Hi James.

8
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,440
Where are you going?

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,630
Dad, I saw your picture.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,960
You used to plait your hair.

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,440
Qing Dynasty was still in power when I was
studying abroad.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,600
The RC Government then ordered people to
cut their plait.

13
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,240
Still conservative people

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,715
can't accept that China's changed.

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,749
Aren't we going to Wu Dang Mt?

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,960
The train will set off in 2 hours.

17
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:57,400
Why are we here in the leased territory?

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,840
Heard that the thing we've been looking for

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,315
is here. I have to find out.

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,870
Dad, what's so important?

21
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,030
Wait here. I'll be right back.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,320
Wang, take care of her.

23
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,908
You said you won't leave me.

24
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,760
Don't worry.

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,950
I won't ever leave you.

26
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,515
Are you Prof.Tang?
- Yes.

27
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,880
Please.

28
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,908
Prof. Tang, thanks for coming to examine it.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,160
You're welcome.

30
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,240
I've studied it for years.

31
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,033
I'm very glad to be able to see it.

32
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,676
Prof.Tang, nice to meet you.

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,000
You too, Mr. Paul Chen.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,202
You're famous for collecting goodies
worldwide.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,791
Now you've even got Xuan Tian Sword.

36
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,516
It was made two thousand years ago.

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,150
Thanks to its mysterious power

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,200
Tang became a magnificent country.

39
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,320
Prof.Tang, please.

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,229
It was made of meteoric stone

41
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,040
that has an unique magnetic field.

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,304
It belonged to a mysterious clan

43
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,760
but they lost it after being wiped out in wars.

44
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,394
Said it appeared once on Wu Dang Mt.

45
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,399
Your Highness, you can have it for 300000
dollars.

46
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,240
If you bring it back to China, it'll be worth a lot
more.

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,913
Prof.Tang, you...

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,579
Seven spirits on the mountain. Zhenjing
sleeps on Tiandan.

49
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,131
Wushou hidden outside Ba Mai Cave.
Precious bead of Lei Huo on the clouds.

50
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,310
Seems like it's true.

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,654
This Sword is only one of the 7 Treasures.

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,075
What did you say, 7 Treasures?

53
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,471
Is this a treasure map?

54
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,435
Tang Yunlong, what are you up to?

55
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,157
I should be asking you.

56
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,075
This Xuan Tian Sword is fake.

57
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,360
Paul Chen, dare you fool me!

58
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
You guys could be in cahoots.

59
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,680
Whatever...

60
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
you've destroyed my sword.

61
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,840
You've got to pay for it.

62
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,794
Go get the map.

63
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
Wang, let's go.

64
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
Dad, you in a fight?

65
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,467
I'm fine. Let's go to the station, hurry.

66
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,437
while men are fighting at the borders.

67
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,153
They do the weaving at home.

68
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,269
They farm on days and weave at nights.

69
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,589
They work all day and all night.

70
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,834
So soldiers have things to eat and clothes to
wear.

71
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,358
Look at me now if you don't believe.

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,880
Look at all of them.

73
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,440
Our shoes, socks, and clothes

74
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,074
Ms. Why staring at me like that?

75
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,710
Are you fond of me?

76
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,848
You represent Beijing to attend the WDM
Martial Arts Competition?

77
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,913
I'm the most handsome martial artist in Beijing
and Tianjin.

78
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,353
Pretty things on a pretty girl.

79
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Leave her alone.

80
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
Don't be afraid.

81
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,029
You're going to Hubei, what for?

82
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
To steal.

83
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Interesting.

84
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
Steal what?

85
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Steal an invitation card.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,640
Like this one.

87
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,600
You want to steal my invitation card?

88
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,320
You want to go to the competition instead of
me?

89
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,479
You should either go home or go to the
hospital.

90
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,890
Dare you talk to me like that.

91
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,440
Who's going to represent Wu Dang to attend
the competition?

92
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,560
Has our Mentor decided yet?

93
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:09,356
Bailong, he's sleeping. Don't bother him. Let's
go.

94
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,240
Not yet arrived.

95
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Who's he waiting for?

96
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Watch out, Ning.

97
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,760
You okay?

98
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,360
Go.

99
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
What a careless guys!

100
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Popped up out of nowhere.

101
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,960
What's wrong?

102
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,840
It's down. We have to continue on foot.

103
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
Okay.

104
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,074
Dad, was that a Taoist?

105
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,120
I think so.

106
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,232
I think he's kind. Let's go.

107
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,116
Shui Heyi, you're late.

108
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Bro, I...

109
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,760
Why so little water?

110
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,838
Bro, I came across a motorbike on the way.

111
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,720
It almost ran me over so...

112
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,880
Don't be lying.

113
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,673
You know how strict Bailong is, right?

114
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,558
Go clean out the grass over there.

115
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Sure.

116
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,274
Hi, we're attending the competition.

117
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,079
Master Xie's gone.

118
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,120
Let's go, hurry.
- What happened?

119
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Master Xie's gone.

120
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,800
Our Mentor's gone.

121
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Excuse me.

122
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,120
His heartbeat has stopped.

123
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,318
Our Mentor's gone. We're all sad.

124
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Life's short.

125
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,231
I think he's gone to Heaven.

126
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,600
Who is he?

127
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,070
He's Tang Yunlong, the sponsor for the
competition.

128
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,230
His vital signs are all gone

129
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,032
but I guess he's breathing like a tortoise.

130
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,989
Scientifically speaking, he's hibernating.

131
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,840
Hibernating.

132
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,794
Yeah, sort of in a conscious sleep.

133
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,360
He's so unpredictable.

134
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:47,193
Master Xie... Xie's awake.

135
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
Master, you're awake.

136
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:56,676
Thank God. You're here finally.

137
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:01,075
Guys, Shui Heyi will represent Wu Dang.

138
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,350
Awesome. You made him awake.

139
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,040
It's you.

140
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
Shui Heyi's a secular man.

141
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,871
He knows just a little bit of martial arts.

142
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,839
He's not a senior. He can't.

143
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,435
Right, Master Xie.

144
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,872
I'm not skiIful at all.

145
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,880
I just want to spend time with my mother

146
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,160
and take care of her illness.

147
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,697
I can't represent Wu Dang to attend the
competition.

148
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,675
The useless are the most useful. Nothing is
impossible.

149
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,797
Master, if you let him, we'll lose.

150
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,988
This event takes place once every 500 years.

151
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,398
We can't afford to lose.

152
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,711
If you're too desperate to win, you'll lose.

153
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,713
Go get ready for the competition.

154
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,913
No. I should talk to my mother first.

155
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,586
Is there a treasure map in your hands?

156
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,640
No, there isn't.

157
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,320
You're here to steal something?

158
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,425
I'm sorry, Taoist Master, I'm lost.

159
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Is this Xiao Yao Palace?

160
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,600
I'm not a Taoist Master.

161
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,154
A Taoist Master's over there, Ma'am.

162
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Hi there.

163
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,032
I'm the representative of Beijing-Tianjin.

164
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
I'm here for the competition.

165
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
My brother's sick.

166
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,840
So I came instead of him.

167
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,918
My name's Tianxin, not Ma'am.

168
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,320
To celebrate 500th anniversary of the
re-establishment of...

169
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,590
Wu Long Palace on Wu Dang Mt.

170
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:01,590
We're holding this competition for Taoist
juniors

171
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,515
from all over the country

172
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,240
and overseas Chinese organizations.

173
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,705
It's to promote Taoist martial arts

174
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,640
and encourage youngsters

175
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,231
to communicate and learn from each other.

176
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,640
Now, please welcome Wei Chunyang for Kong
Dong Clan, Sichuan.

177
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,720
His opponent is from Beijing-Tianjin of Henan
and Hebei

178
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,855
the representative of Long Men Clan, Tianxin.

179
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,515
I don't fight women. Go home.

180
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,716
This could be the biggest mistake you've ever
made.

181
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,960
That's called Paocui.

182
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,240
If you get hit by that, you'll be in trouble.

183
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,160
If you're up against a man like that

184
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,357
don't fight, just admit defeat.

185
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,590
You think she's going to lose?

186
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Good.

187
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,636
Is she playing Tai Chi? What is that?

188
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,918
Is that Zhang Sangfeng's Changsijing?

189
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,440
Not quite.

190
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Changsijing?

191
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:57,760
Good.

192
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,800
Tianxin won.

193
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,990
Good.

194
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,360
Second match,

195
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,199
Tangning for the ATA

196
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,440
Dear,
- versus Wanglei for Shang Qing
Clan, Taiwan.

197
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,040
you're here to learn.

198
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,000
Take it easy.

199
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,520
Taiyi Five Elements Form versus Silken Palms.
- Admit defeat if you can't win.

200
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,949
Dad, you've said it many times.

201
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,511
Alright, I'll give you signs.

202
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,280
Tangning won.

203
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Good.

204
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
It hurts?

205
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,912
Hang in there. I'll be gentle.

206
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,829
Dad, was I great back there?

207
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,840
Dare you mention it again.

208
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,439
I told you to take it easy, didn't I?

209
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,832
You played it hard. I was worried.

210
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,518
Why did you tell me not to be serious

211
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,895
while you're indeed serious about everything?

212
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,037
Alright, it's late.

213
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,679
I shall go back to sleep. Good night.

214
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,720
Dad,

215
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,355
what did mom come down with?

216
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,072
I wonder how you got to know her.

217
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
I told you, didn't I?

218
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,990
I used to plait my hair.

219
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,547
I met your mother in a Chinese restaurant

220
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,589
while I was studying in America.

221
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,393
Alright, it's late. Go to bed.

222
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,394
Dad, you're here with a treasure map.

223
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,200
I think you're up to something.

224
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,268
Are we here just to watch and learn Kung fu?

225
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,955
I'll get you a boyfriend.

226
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,840
Don't be kidding.

227
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,636
Alright, don't be mad.

228
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,478
Golden Palace. Nan Yan.

229
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,073
Seven spirits on the mountain. Wu Long
Palace.

230
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Dad.

231
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,717
You should've got married and had kids if your
dad was here.

232
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,270
I'm so weak here.

233
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,270
Mom, you know

234
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,668
we're here on Wu Dang Mt, a very spiritual
place.

235
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,030
You will get well for sure.

236
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,389
All I want now is to get you a wife.

237
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Dad, you promised me

238
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,349
that we'd be like partners.

239
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,840
I'm not your dad.

240
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,960
What's going on?
- It's okay, mom.

241
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,440
Be calm.

242
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
What happened?
- Who is that?

243
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
It's you.

244
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
Why? You know her?

245
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,520
She's Taoist Xie's guest.

246
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,475
What a girl. Son, you don't have to be a monk
now.

247
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
Dear, you alright?

248
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,514
Tianxin, Xuan Tian Sword is a holy thing of
ours.

249
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,070
It was made of meteoric stone, and powerful.

250
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,353
Your dad looked for it for years, but couldn't
find it.

251
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,120
When his body was discovered in the desert

252
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,708
there was such a bead in his hand.

253
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,079
It could be related with the Sword's
whereabouts.

254
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,760
You must finish what you dad didn't when you
grow up.

255
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,040
You theif.

256
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Got a partner huh?

257
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,400
Hurry.

258
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,280
Dear, you're awake.

259
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,520
You fell from the top.
I was worried

260
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,473
that you might be paralyzed like me.

261
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,069
Sorry for ruining your roofs.

262
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,600
My dad will pay for it.

263
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,720
No need. I've fixed it.

264
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,907
Aren't you the representative of Wu Dang?

265
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,296
I'm one of the participants.
I won a match today.

266
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,840
We may compete against each other in the
future.

267
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,037
I won't attend the competition.

268
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Why?

269
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,625
I have to take care of my mom here.

270
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,800
You should get married soon.

271
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,002
Then you don't have to look after me yourself.

272
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,999
Dear, what's your name?

273
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,560
Tangning.

274
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,840
Ning, this is my son.

275
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,714
His name's Shui Heyi, not yet married.

276
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,320
How about you?

277
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,398
Mom, she's still young. Don't embarrass her.

278
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
She's not I guess.

279
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,800
Mom, time to sleep.

280
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,992
Son, you two are a good match.

281
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,680
I'll fall asleep soon.

282
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:57,240
You have a good talk. I won't overhear you.

283
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,360
Alright, sleep.

284
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,160
Ms, you must be lost.

285
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,919
You can call me Tangning.

286
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,880
Mosquitoes are bad insects.

287
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,360
Still they're living things like us.
Plus, I promised

288
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:34,392
not to kill so mom will get well.

289
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,819
When it gets cool at nights, mosquitoes will go
naturally.

290
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,118
We humans are part of the nature.

291
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,830
So are mosquitoes and everything else.

292
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,880
Do we secular beings have to learn Taoism?

293
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,680
I'm stupid anyway.

294
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,713
Taoist Xie taught me how to reunite with
Heaves

295
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,675
and to meditate so as to feel life.

296
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,280
I just can't.

297
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,080
Can you?

298
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
I feel like...

299
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
I'm losing it.

300
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,518
It's you. Aren't you the sponsor?

301
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,560
Glad that I was there.

302
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,760
You would've been caught if not for me.

303
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
Nonsense. I saved you.

304
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,280
You wouldn't have escaped if not for my last
powerful strike.

305
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,080
You're here to steal the Sword?

306
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,160
It belongs to my family.

307
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,880
I've been looking for it for years.

308
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,080
Good.

309
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,680
There're 7 treasures here on Wu Dang Mt.

310
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,640
Let's work together and steal them.

311
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,775
You'll get the Sword, and I'll have the rest.

312
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,760
You know how good Bailong is, don't you?

313
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,000
You can't pull it off alone.

314
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,240
Let's work together alright?

315
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,397
Why not? Our motives are different anyway.

316
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,800
I'm here to retrieve what's mine, but you're
here to steal.

317
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,000
I wonder...

318
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,000
why you're here with your daughter. You
almost got her killed.

319
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
What? Got her killed?

320
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,437
She mistook me as you back there.

321
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,679
She followed me and fell off the cliff.

322
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,595
Don't worry, she probably...

323
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,320
Here's Wu Dang Mt. Any illness can't be
cured.

324
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
Ning.

325
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,800
Ning.

326
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:48,912
Dad, what's wrong with you?

327
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,713
You okay? Did you fall off the cliff?

328
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,920
Yes, but I know martial arts.

329
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
I'm fine. See?

330
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
I was worried sick.

331
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,560
Liukun from Da Mao CIan, Yunnan, won.

332
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,920
Next match...

333
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,360
Li Xuande from Quan Zhen Clan, North Korea

334
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,562
versus Zhangyang from Feng Lai Clan,
Shangdong.

335
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,520
Li Xuande won.

336
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:42,560
Last match, Tangning for the ATA

337
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,440
Ning, remember admit defeat if you can't win.

338
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,647
versus Tianxin from Long Men Clan, Beijing-Tianjin.
- Alright.

339
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,320
I will fight hard.

340
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,589
You should do the same. Don't let your dad
down.

341
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,640
Come on.

342
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
I admit defeat.

343
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,360
You're better.

344
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Tangning won.

345
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,280
You were lucky. Where are you going?

346
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,320
It's a secret.

347
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,960
Prof.Tang, did you...?

348
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
I lost. What a pity!

349
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,440
Sorry, did I hurt you?

350
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:08,160
Ms Tianxin, did you sleep well last night?

351
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,794
No. I had bad dreams.

352
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Mom, hang in there.

353
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Shui Heyi.

354
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,195
Mom, we're almost there, hold on.

355
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,680
If my guess is right

356
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,000
Bailong is suspicious of both of us.

357
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:42,520
That's why you deliberately admitted defeat.

358
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,600
You want to act in the broad daylight.

359
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,120
Bailong is kind of busy now.

360
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,523
The Sword is not guarded. We have a better
chance.

361
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,080
The next line indicates our next target.

362
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,280
Zhenjing and Tiandan...

363
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,709
Why not going to steal the Sword?

364
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:59,939
I'm not that stupid. If you get the Sword, you'll
be gone.

365
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,836
Zhenjing could mean Laozi's Daodejing.

366
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,400
It's in Xiao Yao Palace.

367
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,795
Another treasure is Tiandan

368
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,393
that's the answer to all illnesses, made by
Physician Zhang.

369
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,360
It's hidden...

370
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,360
The Prince should rest in the bed of Dragon.

371
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,880
No big deal.

372
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,640
It's just Tiandan.

373
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,520
Poetry is nothing difficult.

374
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Let's split up then.

375
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,640
Alright.

376
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
If you think

377
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
you can do it alone.

378
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,160
How about this? You go get Zhenjing,
I'll go for Tiandan.

379
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,880
Why should I go for Zhenjing?

380
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,920
I've checked.

381
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,060
Only two Taoists to guard Xiao Yao Palace. It
should be easy.

382
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,919
The biggest mistake you've ever made...

383
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
I'm kidding.

384
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,031
Everyone here is a Master. You better watch
out.

385
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,814
See who'll get it first before the sunset.

386
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,268
Mom, you're awake.

387
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
Tangning...

388
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
Ma'am.

389
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,273
Now she's physically well.
She was just mentally sick.

390
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,436
Alright, you can get off the bed and have a
walk.

391
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,680
Have a walk?

392
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,840
Give it a try.

393
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Mom, have a try.

394
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
One, two, three.

395
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,629
Mom, you can walk now.

396
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,704
Sit down first.
- I can walk now.

397
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:12,153
Thank God. You're so lucky.

398
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,995
Your mom's all right now.

399
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
Thank you.
- Thanks.

400
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,360
Now you can focus on the competition.

401
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,120
I...

402
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,789
No need to be a monk now. Go enjoy the
competition.

403
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,754
Should I thank Taoist Xie.

404
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,040
Yeah I know.

405
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,920
Who is it?

406
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Get him.

407
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Freeze.

408
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,796
Thanks a lot.

409
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,634
Master, I'm Zixu from Jiu Tian
Palace on Hua Mt.

410
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,640
Can we have a talk?

411
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Can we have a talk, Master?

412
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Master, be frank with you.

413
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,594
Someone stole Laozi's Zhenjing from us.

414
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,400
I think since...

415
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,865
Yinjing... you have Yangjing right?

416
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,914
Our Yinjing has been stolen.

417
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,390
So has your Yangjing right?

418
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,400
I've got you.

419
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,479
I've got you, fool.

420
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,391
Why no guards?

421
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,558
I shouldn't have wasted my breath.

422
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,224
Could Zhenjing be in this place?

423
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,720
Could this be a trap?

424
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,185
What is this? Such a piece of cake.

425
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,933
I shouldn't have wasted time practicing

426
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,120
for so long.

427
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Tang Yunlong, you're late.

428
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,920
You lost.

429
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,040
Tianxin, you won.

430
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,880
You're injured.

431
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,080
You too.

432
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,720
The Taoist you mentioned was awesome.

433
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
He almost got me.

434
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,880
Here. It's rusted.

435
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
What's the use of it?

436
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,160
Look.

437
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,280
What's our next target?

438
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,358
Wushou hidden outside Ba Mai Cave.

439
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,668
You said it's simple. Tell me what it means.

440
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,800
It's simple.

441
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:28,400
Yeah.

442
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,071
Ba Mai Cave... I think it means two treasures
here.

443
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,670
Look... Ba Mai in a cave...

444
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,400
Wushou, it could mean the black...

445
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,520
Shouwu.

446
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,470
Wu Dang Mt is a holy place.

447
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,080
Said there're two thousand-year-old
human-like Shouwu.

448
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,591
Only two? I guess there's a lot.

449
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,439
They're like a couple fighting a lot.

450
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,280
That's why I hate men. I Iike being single.

451
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,013
You women are annoying. I like freedom.

452
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,320
We could never be on the same wavelength.

453
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:06,280
I guess you'd sell all your treasures soon

454
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,840
after you get them.

455
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,000
I just want to go home.

456
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,080
I'm not that greedy, selfish

457
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,880
and money-minded as you think.

458
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,278
Alright, don't waste my time here.

459
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,240
You think you're righteous?

460
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,440
You said the Sword belongs to your family.

461
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
Prove it.

462
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:24,560
It does belong to my family.

463
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,240
Prove it.

464
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,370
It is mine, believe it or not.

465
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,471
I'll get the Sword even without you.

466
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,920
Yes, I can.

467
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,789
Sleeping Kung fu is the best of Internal Martial
Arts.

468
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,412
Zhuangzi dreams of being a butterfly

469
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:55,997
A butterfly dreams of being Zhuangzi.

470
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,720
Our ancestor, Chenbo, once spent 800 years
sleeping

471
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,513
during the best times of Song Dynasty.

472
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,320
Su Qier learned in his sleep

473
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,069
how to fight in Luohan style.

474
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:19,915
A day will pass in a blink of an eye.

475
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:30,958
A sleeping fairy will forget the time.

476
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,836
Concentrate on breaths and be mindful.

477
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:42,319
Let Qi run into Xuanqiao and breathe with the
nature.

478
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:48,800
That's What Master Zhang Sangfeng lectured
on sleeping Kung fu.

479
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,753
You should keep it in mind.

480
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,640
Something's up in Wo Long Palace.

481
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,672
Master's asleep. What happened?

482
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,748
We seven tried to chase him down but failed.

483
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,040
Got to tell Master about it.

484
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,880
Someone stole something from Wo Long
Palace.

485
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:24,960
What did he steal?

486
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,080
Nothing seems to be missing

487
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,600
but we saw him

488
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,393
steal something like a sphere.

489
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,835
Ma'am, why did you let Shui attend the
competition?

490
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:43,354
We're grateful to Taoist Xie. That's to thank
him.

491
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,520
I dreamed of you and Heyi at the altar, getting
married.

492
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,960
Getting what?

493
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:56,469
Nothing.

494
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,432
Ning, go open the box beside my bed.

495
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,313
Nice. I've never tried Mandarin clothes.

496
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,280
Try them on then.

497
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
What do you think?

498
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,960
You picked the right one.

499
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:37,119
It's fated. This wedding dress is from my
mom.

500
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Nice.

501
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,730
Seems like I've disturbed you.

502
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,840
Why are you in my mom's dress?

503
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,155
She gave it to me. Nice?

504
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,640
Yes. Where is my mom?

505
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,837
She's asIeep. I'm here for you.

506
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:15,872
I'm practicing Kung fu. Thanks for taking care
of my mom.

507
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,760
My pleasure.

508
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,189
She sleeps like a baby.

509
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,036
I told her a story then she fell asleep.

510
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,509
You and your mom are close. So are my dad
and I.

511
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,200
He's been teaching me

512
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,800
how to fight and live well.

513
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,760
He did some researches.

514
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,678
He thinks Taoism is pretty scientific.

515
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
I've said too much I guess.

516
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:45,000
Don't worry. I'll come visit your mom as long
as I have time.

517
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,120
Show me your hand.

518
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,800
Close your eyes.

519
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:53,073
I once used it to help Taoist Xie out.

520
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,280
I'm giving it to you.

521
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:02,400
What's wrong?

522
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:05,602
It's just a little caterpillar. Why so scared?

523
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,400
Liukun for Da Mao Clan, Yunnan

524
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,637
versus Tangning for the ATA.

525
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,040
Honey.

526
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,572
Dad, I feel confident with you here.

527
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,560
Tang Yunlong, come with me.

528
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,680
Why? I can't leave now.

529
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,960
Look over there.

530
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,400
They're looking for you.

531
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,160
Don't worry. I'll admit defeat if I can't win.

532
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,280
You guys go.

533
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,680
Hurry.

534
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,240
Boss, Tang Yunlong's over there.

535
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,800
Follow him. Kill him if necessary.

536
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,920
Okay.

537
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:24,680
I'm fine. Don't worry.

538
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,720
Wake up, will you?

539
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,920
We're being followed.

540
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,560
They're not from Wu Dang. Their shoes are
different.

541
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,680
Never mind. Let's go.

542
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:03,160
Tangning won.

543
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,040
This should be Ba Mai Cave.

544
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,720
Lots of people to welcome us.

545
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,000
You sneak in through Long Tou Xiang.

546
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,671
Let's split up and lead them to the woods on
the left.

547
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,920
Stop right there.

548
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,670
Stop. Don't run.

549
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,680
Let's go.

550
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,320
This is Ba Mai PaIace, not Ba Mai Cave.

551
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,440
It can't be wrong.

552
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,960
It must have something to do with Ba Mai.

553
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,280
They're all broken statues, nothing precious.

554
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,147
It's got to be around. Let's look for it.

555
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,760
You think you could fool me?

556
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,075
I've been waiting for you, Prof.Tang.

557
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,200
Go ahead.

558
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,120
I...

559
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,595
I may lose to a woman.

560
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,520
I...

561
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,856
I won't tear my clothes up and pretend I'm hurt.

562
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,360
You go look for the treasure.

563
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,520
Hurry, please.

564
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,360
Seriously,

565
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,480
you know what Ba Mai means?

566
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,283
Ba Mai means 8 extraordinary channels of the
body.

567
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:30,320
Got it?

568
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,440
Take that.

569
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,160
Got it.

570
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,070
Tianxin, I've got the gold figure.

571
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,720
Tang YunIong, surprised that I'm still alive?

572
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,116
Sorry for hurting your leg.

573
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:06,058
You know you owe me much huh? Give me
that gold figure.

574
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,400
And your bag?

575
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,440
Get him.

576
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,280
You take it and go. I'll take care of them.

577
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,920
I won't leave without you.

578
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,040
Let's fight then.

579
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,840
Watch out.

580
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:47,120
Your sleeping Kung fu is lousy. You'll lose.

581
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,913
It's just that I'm stupid.

582
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,956
I'm only here to want to fix my mom's illness.

583
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,318
I'd like to have that caterpillar back.

584
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,640
Not afraid?

585
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,760
No.

586
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Here.

587
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,000
I'm not afraid of it

588
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,269
because I know it'll become a butterfly one
day.

589
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,237
Now it can only crawl, but soon it'll fly

590
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,640
freely in the sky.

591
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:21,438
It's like going to another space.

592
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:23,920
Will men go to another space

593
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,040
while dreaming?

594
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,390
Dreams, butterflies, another space?

595
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:38,355
Just imagine your mom's recovered, and
you're relieved

596
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:40,800
like a leaf

597
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,188
floating in the air.

598
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:48,735
Like a butterfly flying to wherever you want.

599
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,839
Thank you. I feel so much better now.

600
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:12,438
Reunite with the nature.

601
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,560
What a beautiful leaf.

602
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,840
Let me see.

603
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,080
No.

604
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:28,108
Shui, you think dying is

605
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
like sleeping?

606
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:37,599
I mean, if I die one day

607
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,392
will I meet you in another space?

608
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,800
What are you talking about?

609
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:48,789
I have a genetic strange disease.
It can't be fixed.

610
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:54,271
My mom and grandma all died of it

611
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,080
when they were young.

612
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:08,596
I'm not afraid anyway. I just don't want to be
made useless.

613
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:14,758
You won't.
You won't die young either.

614
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,320
Alright, let's drop it.

615
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,949
I have a wish as a healthy girl here.

616
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,519
Let's present a great match tomorrow

617
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:31,628
like you and I attending the graduation
ceremony alright?

618
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,400
Sure.

619
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:36,600
You're a man.

620
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,235
You should never lie.

621
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:57,760
We've got three of them.

622
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,080
Fourth line... Lei Huo...
it should be Lei Huo Palace.

623
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,210
On the clouds... it could mean

624
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:07,077
clouds upon the top of the mountain.

625
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:13,160
The Big Dipper.

626
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,280
Shouwu hidden outside Ba Mai Cave.

627
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,840
Here we're outside Ba Mai Cave.

628
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,707
We should be seeing a lot of Shouwu here.

629
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,000
Isn't Shouwu precious?

630
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:25,001
No precious things will grow all over here.

631
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:29,950
Are you Shouwu? Are you?

632
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,817
Actually we're looking for the spirit of Wu
Dang Mt.

633
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,720
Rumor has it that it attaches to the roots of
Shouwu.

634
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:39,800
Like human vessels connecting with the whole
Wu Dang Mt.

635
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,360
More amazingly...

636
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,440
it can communicate with us after it takes
human shape.

637
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:47,518
Don't you think

638
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,200
it was too easy to get all of this?

639
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:53,040
Plus, your map and mine are basically the
same.

640
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,799
You have doubts about the map?

641
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,360
Maybe I'm too paranoid.

642
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:01,999
I've lost my faith in men and things.

643
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:04,873
At least you believe in Tiandan.

644
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,640
I believed in science

645
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,775
not anything that can't be proved by science.

646
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,080
But later I realized

647
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,520
there're things that can't be explained by
science.

648
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,923
Lots of diseases can't be fixed by science
either.

649
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,680
I really have no clue

650
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,371
how to find the spirit of Shouwu.

651
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:30,113
You said it can communicate with us.

652
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,080
You can try to locate it with your heart.

653
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,720
It's only a rumor.

654
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:36,400
Like you said,

655
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:39,066
science can't explain a lot of things.

656
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:44,760
The Big Dipper.

657
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:47,292
I remember my grandpa used to say...

658
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
when a man dies,

659
01:06:51,160 --> 01:06:53,170
he'll become a star in the sky

660
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,320
to watch his beloved.

661
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,520
So I'd always like...

662
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,640
to wish upon a star.

663
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,160
You try it.

664
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:51,720
It shows up.

665
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:53,840
You must be sincere.

666
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,600
According to Compendium of Materia Medica

667
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,000
Male Shouwu is red. Female one is white.

668
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,350
They're indeed like a couple.

669
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,080
Got them.

670
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,640
Smells nice.

671
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,280
You're here, Ning.

672
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,640
Where's Shui?

673
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,760
He went to pick firewood.

674
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,713
Please God, let Tangning get well soon.

675
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:25,679
Or pass her illness to me, please.

676
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:55,920
Hungry? Let's go.

677
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:20,918
I'm here for my father, Prof.Tang.

678
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,600
Could you please call him out?

679
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:27,941
We're looking for him too. Go back to your
room. Don't come out.

680
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,320
He won't be back tonight.

681
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:49,278
He's fine, but he's worried about you

682
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,440
so he let me come.

683
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:55,597
I know. I'll take good care of myself.

684
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,512
Tianxin, I'm so lucky.

685
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,890
I'll enter the final tomorrow.

686
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:10,032
Could my dad come and watch me?

687
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:20,992
Ning, he's doing the stealing for you.

688
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
You know?

689
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,400
Yes.

690
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,037
Lots of Taoists are searching for him.

691
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:34,840
My dad's a great man.

692
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,400
But now

693
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,917
he's doing the stealing for me.

694
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:04,707
Have a rest. You've got a match tomorrow.

695
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,200
I'm afraid.

696
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:11,440
Do you believe in miracles?

697
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:24,030
I used to think that with faith and hopes

698
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,070
I could live on well.

699
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,160
Now I've reaIized that

700
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:34,837
they can't really change what's become.

701
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,280
Tianxin...

702
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,760
my dad...

703
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,829
didn't believe in miracles at all

704
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:48,872
but now he's buying it for me.

705
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:54,078
I guess you've had a hard life

706
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:57,520
just like your dad.

707
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,640
He may

708
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,160
appear to be happy on the outside

709
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:04,491
while he's really worried inside.

710
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,920
Tianxin

711
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,080
could you do me a favor

712
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,794
and fulfill my one last wish?

713
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,640
Don't say something bad.

714
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:20,454
Sure, as long as you promise to live well.

715
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,430
Alright, please marry my dad.

716
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:30,000
Ever since my mom passed away

717
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:35,319
I've seldom seen smiles upon his face.

718
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,829
I realize that he's kind of happy with you.

719
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,075
I like to be free you know?

720
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,693
I don't think I can help you with that.

721
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:56,880
I'm afraid.

722
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:01,511
What if I have to leave him one day?

723
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:07,398
I really don't want to leave him alone.

724
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,520
Stop crying.

725
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,520
Your dad won't be left alone.

726
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:56,510
Here you are at such a high altitude.

727
01:15:01,240 --> 01:15:03,160
Let's go back down and talk.

728
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:06,113
Go back down, you serious?

729
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:10,640
Tang Yunlong and that girl have disappeared.

730
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,672
Are they gone with those treasures?

731
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,600
I don't think so since his daughter's still here.

732
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:21,400
I suggest we kill him and take one or two of his
treasures.

733
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,876
No, I want all 7 of them.

734
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:30,100
They're more precious than any wealth and
power in the world.

735
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,876
I made treasure maps and gave them out.

736
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:39,037
That's why Tang Yunlong's here.

737
01:15:39,480 --> 01:15:42,472
So is the long lost Ding Feng Bead.

738
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,879
Shui, finally we're here in a match.

739
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:58,512
Ning, I don't want to fight you. I'll admit defeat.

740
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,880
You promised me.

741
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:07,154
You're a man. You should never lie.

742
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,760
Stop.

743
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,520
Stop it.

744
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,040
Ning.

745
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:19,315
I wish to stay here as long as I can.

746
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:33,997
Let's carry on.

747
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Okay.

748
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:35,280
It's just a sword made of stone.

749
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,240
It has an unique magnetic field

750
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:48,432
unlike anything on Earth. Apologies.

751
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,354
Look, this is the mark of our family.

752
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,200
I'll go get the lightning rod on top.

753
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:32,880
Then all we need is Ding Feng Bead.

754
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:33,880
Don't go yet.

755
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,546
It attracts lightning. It's dangerous.

756
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:39,957
It's made to pass voltage currents to ground.

757
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,440
That's why the Golden Palace has never been
struck by lightning

758
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,560
in the last 500 years.

759
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:49,107
You've got the Sword. You going home now?

760
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,191
I will, but not now.

761
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:59,019
I promised Ning that I won't go till her illness is
cured.

762
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:02,840
She knows already?

763
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,640
Thought I could keep her in the dark

764
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:07,760
and let her live happily.

765
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,040
She pretended that she didn't know

766
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,160
just not to make you worry.

767
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:16,200
Ning's a good girl.

768
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,160
Fetch me the gold needle.

769
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:33,400
Ning.

770
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:35,520
Taoist Xie.

771
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,840
Not an internal injury. This is a weird illness.

772
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:43,078
She's bleeding all over inside.

773
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:44,880
Taoist Xie.

774
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,960
You could cure my mom.

775
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,080
I guess you can cure her too.

776
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,356
It's all about fortune and fate.

777
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,440
Ning.

778
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:00,560
Ning.

779
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,840
Ning.

780
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,360
Dad.
- Ning.

781
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,480
Dad's here,

782
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:08,080
Ning.

783
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:14,594
Dad, I admitted defeat.
I...

784
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:18,960
Can't you cure her with Tiandan?

785
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,080
What are you waiting for?

786
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,080
Haven't got all 7 of them. Don't know if it's
going to work.

787
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:27,430
Don't hesitate. Try it now.

788
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:34,468
Tang YunIong, you're here for your daughter.

789
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,920
Let's set it straight then.

790
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,611
I have to save my daughter first.

791
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,560
All the treasures should be mine.

792
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:45,912
Give them to me.
Or I'll kill your daughter.

793
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,869
This is what I need, right?

794
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,714
Bailong, this lightning rod is a holy thing.
You crazy?

795
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:19,591
I'm not.
Things are going as I planned.

796
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:24,994
This is fate. This is to reunite with the nature.

797
01:22:25,320 --> 01:22:28,471
You want to the Mentor huh?
No way.

798
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,664
I want to be more than a Mentor.

799
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:37,400
You've got me wrong.

800
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:58,438
I've planned this for years

801
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,958
to want to get Ding Feng Bead.

802
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,960
That's the necklace from my dad.
Is that the Ding Feng Bead?

803
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,959
Back then your dad Tianyu and I
came to Wu Dang

804
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:14,138
to want to retrieve Xuan Tian Sword that
belongs to us.

805
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,360
Then he discovered my secret

806
01:23:19,560 --> 01:23:23,379
of wanting to collect all 7 treasures to be a
holy spirit.

807
01:23:23,640 --> 01:23:27,861
So he decided to ruin it by stealing
the Ding Feng Bead from me.

808
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,397
He just never thought

809
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,718
I had collected 6 of them already.

810
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:42,794
I made a fake treasure map

811
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,720
and surprisingly his daughter presented
the Ding Feng bead herself.

812
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,640
You...

813
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,200
You have to take the right course
to be a holy spirit.

814
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,198
Bailong, what you've done is all evil.

815
01:24:26,160 --> 01:24:28,160
Ning's not making it.

816
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:30,640
Ning.

817
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:32,760
Ning.

818
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:35,120
I'm afraid.

819
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,920
Don't be.

820
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:46,114
7 treasures will make me a holy spirit.

821
01:24:47,760 --> 01:24:52,276
Yin and Yang are not balancing here.

822
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:58,039
A nightmare has truly come.

823
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:03,239
No one's going to stop me now.
Tiandan's working.

824
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:10,149
I'll soon be a holy spirit.

825
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,491
Taoist Xie, Ning's not making it.

826
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:22,880
She needs Tiandan now.

827
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:28,200
Sleeping Kung fu will make you
see emptiness and feel free

828
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,150
like Bailong is feeling now.

829
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:47,638
Bailong, no one dares lie to me.

830
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:50,200
Got to get Tiandan back.

831
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:56,040
You really want to try?

832
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,952
A sleeping fairy will forget the time.

833
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,392
Concentrate on breaths and be mindful.

834
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:29,752
Let Qi run into Xuanqiao and
breathe with the nature.

835
01:26:50,120 --> 01:26:52,120
Master.

836
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,917
Take Tiandan and save Ning now.

837
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:32,080
You're a secular being.
Not a match for me.

838
01:33:24,880 --> 01:33:26,880
Dear.

839
01:33:30,200 --> 01:33:33,431
Dad.

840
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,394
Ning, you okay?

841
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:48,320
Tianxin.

842
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:57,517
Tang Yunlong, you're a strong man

843
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:04,355
but you seem weak every time
you talk about your daughter.

844
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:08,080
The Sword...

845
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:29,352
I'll leave it here on Wu Dang Mt.

846
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:37,560
I'm not going home anyway.

847
01:34:39,760 --> 01:34:43,309
The Sword has found its home here.

848
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,279
This is where my heart belongs too.

849
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,630
Thank you.

850
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,280
Tianxin.

851
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:00,720
Tianxin.

852
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:03,360
Tianxin.

853
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:05,480
Tianxin.

854
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,320
Tianxin.

855
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,546
Is there a treasure map in your hands?

856
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,760
No, there isn't.

857
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:18,760
You're here to steal the Sword?

858
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:20,880
It belongs to my family.

859
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:24,193
The biggest mistake you've ever made...

860
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:25,960
I'm kidding.

861
01:35:26,080 --> 01:35:29,789
Everyone here is a Master.
You better watch out.

862
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,812
I remember my grandpa used to say...

863
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,680
when a man dies,

864
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,210
he'll become a star in the sky

865
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,320
to watch his beloved.

866
01:37:03,800 --> 01:37:05,800
Tianxin.
